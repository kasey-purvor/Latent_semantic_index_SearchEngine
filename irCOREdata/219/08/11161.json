We present SuperDARN radar observations of\nthe nightside high-latitude ionospheric flow during two 6-\nhour intervals of quasi-steady northward interplanetary mag-\nnetic field (IMF). During both intervals (01:30\u201307:30 UT on\n2 December and 21:00\u201303:00 UT on 14\/15 December 1999),\nthe solar wind and IMF remained relatively steady with Bz\npositive and By negative, such that the IMF clock angle\nwas \u223c\u221250\u25e6 to \u221260\u25e6. Throughout both intervals the radar\ndata clearly indicate the presence of a highly distorted By-\ndominated twin cell flow pattern, indicative of an open mag-\nnetosphere, which is confirmed by DMSP and auroral data.\nEstimates of the changes in open flux present during each in-\nterval indicate approximately balanced dayside and nightside\nreconnection at rates of \u223c30\u201335 kV over the full 6 h. How-\never, strong bursts of flow with speeds of over \u223c1000 m s\u22121\nare observed near magnetic midnight on time scales of \u223c1 h,\nwhich are associated with increases in the transpolar voltage.\nThese are indicative of the net closure of open flux by recon-\nnection in the tail. During one large flow burst, the night-\nside reconnection rate is estimated to have been \u223c1.5 times\nthe dayside rate, i.e. \u223c45\u201360 kV compared with \u223c30\u201340 kV.\nMagnetic bays, which would indicate the formation of a sub-\nstorm current wedge, are not observed in association with\nthese bursts.

Ionosphere (plasma convection; ionosphere-\nmagnetosphere interactions) \u2013 Magnetospheric Physics\n(magnetotail)\nCorrespondence to: A. Grocott (ag27@ion.le.ac.uk)\n1 Introduction\nThe dynamics of the Earth\u2019s coupled magnetosphere-\nionosphere system is largely influenced by the orientation\nof the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). More precisely,\nit depends primarily on the strength and orientation of the\ntransverse GSM y and z components of the field, whose\ndirection is given by the \u201cclock angle\u201d, \u03b8 , with respect to\nnorth. Thus, a 0\u25e6 clock angle corresponds to a transverse\nfield purely in the +z direction (northward), \u00b190\u25e6 to \u00b1y (re-\nspectively), and \u00b1180\u25e6 to \u2212z (southward). When the inter-\nplanetary field points south, i.e. when |\u03b8 |>90\u25e6, the dynam-\nics of the system is dominated by Dungey-cycle flow and\nthe substorm cycle (Dungey, 1961; Hones, 1979; Farrugia\net al., 1993; Baker et al., 1996). Reconnection at the low-\nlatitude magnetopause between the geomagnetic field and\nthe IMF results in the formation of open flux tubes, which\nare transported anti-sunward by the solar wind and stored in\nthe lobes of the geomagnetic tail. This process is dominant\nduring the growth phase of substorms, and is associated with\ntwin-vortex flow in the polar ionosphere, which is strongest\non the dayside and is related to a concurrent expansion in\nthe area of open flux in the polar cap (Siscoe and Huang,\n1985; Cowley and Lockwood, 1992). Rapid excitation of\npolar convection during intervals of southward IMF is now\na well-established phenomenon (e.g. Etemadi et al., 1988;\nRuohoniemi et al., 1993; Ridley et al., 1998; Khan and Cow-\nley, 1999), and even the sub-structure of individual magne-\ntopause reconnection events (\u201cflux transfer events\u201d) is well-\nresolved in dayside flow and auroral data (e.g. Lockwood et\nal., 1989; Elphic et al., 1990; Pinnock et al., 1993; Provan\net al., 1998; Neudegg et al., 1999; Milan et al., 2000). Sub-\nsequently, reconnection of lobe flux tubes in the tail current\nsheet results in open flux closure and field line contraction\nback towards the Earth, thus completing the Dungey cycle.\nIt has long been supposed that the tail process dominates\nduring the expansion and recovery phases of substorms. Re-\ncent results from the Geotail spacecraft indeed show that tail\nreconnection typically begins in the dusk sector plasma sheet\nat down-tail distances of\u223c20\u201330RE within a few minutes of\nexpansion phase onset signatures appearing on the ground,\n510 A. Grocott at al.: Ionospheric flow during northward IMF\nand subsequently expands into the dusk and midnight sec-\ntors (Nagai et al., 1998; Petrukovich et al., 1998; Machida et\nal., 1999). This process should also excite twin-vortex flow\nin the polar ionosphere (additional to that driven simultane-\nously by magnetopause processes), but with the flow now\nbeing strongest on the nightside and related to a concurrent\ncontraction in the area of the open flux in the polar cap. Ev-\nidence for flow excitation during substorm expansions has\nrecently been presented by Opgenoorth and Pellinen (1998)\nand Grocott et al. (2002), though matters are generally com-\nplicated by additional flow suppression and polarisation ef-\nfects associated with the strong conductivity gradients in the\nsubstorm-disturbed nightside ionosphere (e.g. Kirkwood et\nal., 1988; Morelli et al., 1995; Weimer, 1999; Gjerloev and\nHoffman, 2001; Khan et al., 2001).\nWhen the interplanetary field points north, it is well es-\ntablished that Dungey-cycle flow and substorm activity are\nreduced (e.g. Fairfield and Cahill, 1966; Reiff et al., 1981),\nthough observations in the dayside ionosphere suggest that\nopen flux tube production does not switch off entirely until\nthe clock angle falls below \u223c30\u25e6\u201340\u25e6 (e.g. Sandholt et al.,\n1998a, b). At the same time, high-latitude reconnection be-\ntween lobe field lines and the IMF begins, exciting additional\nflow cells, particularly on the dayside (e.g. Dungey, 1963;\nRussell, 1972; Reiff and Burch, 1985; Bristow et al., 1998;\nSandholt et al., 1999, 2000, 2001). On the nightside under\nthese conditions a variety of phenomena have recently been\nreported, whose physical connections have yet to be estab-\nlished. Huang et al. (2001) reported observations of quasi-\nsinusoidal nightside flow oscillations in SuperDARN radar\ndata during an extended interval of modest northward IMF\nand small (typically <45\u25e6) clock angle. The flows had am-\nplitudes \u223c500 m s\u22121 and a period of \u223c1 h, and were asso-\nciated with the formation of large-scale clockwise flow vor-\ntices in the post-midnight sector which subsequently propa-\ngated toward dawn. The authors associate these flows with\nglobal oscillations of an essentially closed tail. Walker et al.\n(1998, 2002), on the other hand, have reported the occurrence\nof latitudinally-restricted (\u223c1\u25e6 north-south) bursts of high-\nspeed (\u223c2 km s\u22121) westward flow in the pre-midnight sec-\ntor under similar interplanetary conditions (weak IMF with\nsmall clock angle). These flow bursts had a \u223c12 min recur-\nrence time (four main cycles were observed), and appear to\nhave occurred at the equatorward edge of the dusk convec-\ntion cell. Walker et al. interpret the bursts as being due to\nsporadic energy release and field dipolarisation in the geo-\nmagnetic tail associated with a viscously-driven twin-vortex\nflow system. It was noted by Sutcliffe (1998) that Pi2 and\nweak (few tens of nT) midnight-sector bay activity occurred\nduring these events.\nIn yet another apparent class of nightside phenomena,\nbursty flow events having larger spatial scales and longer\ntime scales have been reported. De la Beaujardie`re et\nal. (1994) report the occurrence of bursts of equatorward-\ndirected flow in nightside Sondrestrom radar data, which\ntook place during a \u201cquiet-time\u201d interval in which the trans-\nverse components of the IMF were small and directed mainly\nnorthward. These flow bursts were initiated near the night-\nside open-closed field line boundary, had amplitudes up to\nseveral 100 m s\u22121, and recur at \u223c1 h intervals, lasting on\neach occasion for a few tens of minutes. Simultaneous au-\nroral data show that each flow pulse was accompanied by an\nactivation of the poleward-most arc system, in which a new\neast-west aligned arc formed poleward of the existing bound-\nary, and subsequently moved equatorward, together with ex-\nisting precipitation structures. This behaviour strongly sug-\ngests an origin in bursts of reconnection in the \u201cquiet-time\u201d\ntail. Poleward boundary auroral intensifications (PBIs) and\narc \u201cbifurcations\u201d have subsequently been shown to occur\ncommonly under a wide variety of conditions, both during\n\u201cquiet\u201d times, and in the growth, expansion and recovery\nphases of substorms (Lyons et al., 1999), often leading to\nthe ejection of one or more north-south aligned auroral forms\n(called \u201cauroral streamers\u201d) towards lower latitudes (Hender-\nson et al., 1998). These longitudinally-restricted \u201cstream-\ners\u201d have themselves been associated with the occurrence\nof narrow \u201cbursty-bulk flow\u201d (BBF) channels of earthward-\ndirected flow in the plasma sheet (Baumjohann, 1990; An-\ngelopoulos et al., 1992), Pi2-band (5\u201350 mHz) activity, and\nlongitudinally-localised injections of energetic particles at\ngeostationary orbit (Sergeev et al., 1999). The relation-\nship between the \u201cstreamer\u201d structures and the large-scale\nionospheric flow has yet to be investigated in detail. How-\never, Senior et al. (2002) have recently reported the occur-\nrence of large-scale bursty flows in the \u201cquiet time\u201d nightside\nionosphere during an interval of \u201cintermediate\u201d clock angles\n>45\u25e6. These flows have a recurrence time of \u223c1 h, with sub-\nstructure on tens of minutes time scales, similar to the bursts\nreported by de la Beaujardie`re et al. (1994), and take the form\nof surges of westward \u201creturn\u201d flow in the dusk convection\ncell, several degrees wide in latitude, and extending in local\ntime from post-midnight towards dusk.\nFrom the above discussion it will be clear that the night-\nside ionosphere and geomagnetic tail for northward IMF is\noften anything but \u201cquiet\u201d, and is instead characterized by a\nwealth of flow and precipitation phenomena having a variety\nof characteristics. However, the relationships between many\nof these phenomena have not yet been clarified, and no over-\nall picture has yet emerged of the behaviour of the tail and\nconjugate ionosphere under these conditions. In this paper\nwe aim to contribute to this issue through the study of Su-\nperDARN radar observations of nightside flows and related\nparameters during two extended intervals in which the IMF\nclock angle remained relatively steady at intermediate val-\nues \u03b8 \u223c\u221250\u25e6 to \u221260\u25e6. Thus, IMF Bz was positive, but the\nlargest transverse field component was IMF By , which was\nconsistently negative. These intervals (on 2 and 14\/15 De-\ncember 1999) were sufficiently extended (\u223c6 h each) that we\nmay reasonably expect the magnetosphere to have reached a\nstate entirely characteristic of those conditions, rather than,\nfor example, being significantly influenced by prior intervals\nof differently-directed IMF. For these northward, but \u201cinter-\nmediate\u201d orientations of the IMF, we may thus expect on the\nbasis of the above discussion that open flux production at\nA. Grocott at al.: Ionospheric flow during northward IMF 511\nthe magnetopause persisted at modest rates, and indeed we\nshow below that IMF By-distorted twin-cell flow persisted\nthroughout both intervals, with transpolar voltages typically\nin the range \u223c20\u201340 kV. We might also anticipate the excita-\ntion of \u201clobe\u201d convection cells on the dayside. However, be-\ncause we have chosen to study intervals with good radar cov-\nerage of the nightside hours, coverage of the dayside flows is\nnot extensive in these data. Thus, the presence or absence of\nlobes cells is not well determined by these data and does not\nform a major topic of discussion.\nWith regard to nightside phenomena, however, a signifi-\ncant question exists concerning the magnetospheric response\nto modest but steady dayside driving under these conditions.\nDuring the growth phase of substorms with the IMF directed\nsouthward, the transpolar voltage (and implied open flux in-\nput to the tail) is typically twice the above values (i.e. \u223c60\u2013\n80 kV), and generally \u223c30\u201340 min elapses before reconnec-\ntion and plasmoid formation is excited in the near-Earth tail\nat substorm expansion phase onset. We may then ask whether\nsubstorms occur with reduced frequency or with reduced am-\nplitude under conditions of reduced but continuous driving.\nIn fact, we show in this paper that no classic substorm fea-\ntures were observed at all during these long intervals. In-\nstead, large-scale bursts of flow were observed in the night-\nside ionosphere, having recurrence time scales of \u223c1 h and\nlasting a few tens of minutes. These properties suggest a con-\nnection with the flow phenomena previously described by de\nla Beaujardie`re et al. (1994) and Senior et al. (2002), and\nthus also, possibly, with BBF\/PBIs. In this paper we exam-\nine these flow observations in some detail, and discuss the\nimplications for the balance between open flux production at\nthe magnetopause and closure in the tail during northward\nIMF intervals of intermediate clock angle.\n2 Instrumentation\nIn this section we provide brief details of the instrumentation\nemployed in this study, which concerns the intervals 01:30\u2013\n07:30 UT on 2 December and 21:00\u201303:00 UT on 14\/15 De-\ncember 1999.\n2.1 SuperDARN radar data\nThe measurements of ionospheric convection velocities pro-\nvided by the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (Super-\nDARN) represent the central focus of our study. SuperDARN\nis an international array of HF coherent radars spanning the\nauroral regions of both the Northern and Southern Hemi-\nspheres (Greenwald et al., 1995). At the time of the inter-\nvals described here, the Northern Hemisphere network (used\nprimarily in this study) consisted of six radars, whose fields\nof view extended \u223c12 h of magnetic local time (MLT). This\nis illustrated in Fig. 1a, which shows the fields of view of\nthe six radars at the centre times of each of the two inter-\nvals, i.e. 04:30 UT on 2 December, and 00:00 UT on 14\/15\nDecember. With increasing magnetic local time, the fields of\nview in each map are of the Saskatoon (T), Kapuskasing (K),\nGoose Bay (G), Iceland West (W), Iceland East (E), and Fin-\nland (F) radars. These are shown on geomagnetic grids ex-\ntending from the pole to 60\u25e6 magnetic latitude, with noon at\nthe top and dusk to the left. The coordinates are Altitude Ad-\njusted Corrected Geomagnetic (AACGM) coordinates, a de-\nvelopment of the PACE system discussed by Baker and Wing\n(1989). The fields of view of those radars from which line-of-\nsight data will be displayed below are shaded blue. These are\nthe Saskatoon, Kapuskasing, Goose Bay, and Iceland West\nradars for the first interval, and the Goose Bay, Iceland West,\nIceland East and Finland radars for the second. Data will be\ndisplayed from the beam directions marked by the red lines.\nIt should be noted, however, that the fields of view of the\nradars changed significantly with respect to MLT over each\ninterval, and encompassed the whole nightside ionosphere\nat \u223c02:00 UT. Continuous observations of the whole night-\nside over an interval which extends on either side of this time\nare, therefore, not possible, a limitation which is reflected in\nthe analysis of the flow data below. Data from the South-\nern Hemisphere network (which consisted of the four radars\nTiger (R), Halley (H), Syowa (J), and Syowa East (N)) are\nalso discussed below, although no detailed analysis is per-\nformed due to limited coverage. Their fields of view are,\ntherefore, not shown here.\nDuring both study intervals, all ten radars were operat-\ning in a standard mode in which each radar scans through\n16 beams of azimuthal separation 3.24\u25e6, with a total scan\ntime of 2 min. Each beam is divided into 75 range gates of\nlength 45 km, and so in each full scan the radars cover 52\u25e6\nin azimuth and over 3000 km in range. Large-scale maps\nof the high-latitude convection have been derived from this\ndata using the \u201cMap Potential\u201d model developed by Ruo-\nhoniemi and Baker (1998). The line-of-sight velocities are\nmapped onto a polar grid, and used to determine a solution\nfor the electrostatic potential which is expressed in spheri-\ncal harmonics. The equipotentials of the solution represent\nthe plasma streamlines of the modelled convection pattern.\nInformation from the statistical model of Ruohoniemi and\nGreenwald (1996), parameterised by concurrent IMF con-\nditions, is used to stabilize the solution where no data are\navailable. Here, spherical harmonic fits, which use terms up\nto sixth order, are employed to fit the Northern Hemisphere\ndata, with the functions being expressed about a pole that has\nbeen shifted by 2\u25e6 towards the nightside. A lower-latitude\nconvection limit of 67\u25e6 relative to this pole has also been\nimposed, as deemed appropriate for the contracted nature of\nthe flow pattern during these two intervals (see Ruohoniemi\nand Baker (1998) for a detailed discussion of the Map Poten-\ntial algorithm). The flow vectors which will be shown super-\nposed on the electric equipotentials patterns are derived using\nthe SuperDARN line-of-sight velocity measurements and the\ntransverse velocity component from the spherical harmonic\nfit.\n512 A.

Blue dots indicate three stations\nwhich span the local time extent of the radar fields of view. Yellow dots indicate stations which span individual events which are studied in\ndetail. The black oval represents the ionospheric footprint of geostationary orbit.\n2.2 Ground magnetometer data\nFigure 1b shows the locations of the ground magnetic sta-\ntions employed, indicated in the figure by the black circles on\nthe same magnetic grids and at the same times as in Fig. 1a.\nData have been inspected from all the magnetograms of six\nNorthern Hemisphere arrays which span the same 12 h of\nMLT as the SuperDARN radars. These are the Canadian\nCANOPUS array (Grant et al., 1992), the Geological Sur-\nvey of Canada array, the MACCS array (Hughes and En-\ngebretson, 1997), the Greenland magnetometer chain (Friis-\nChristensen et al., 1985), the Scandinavian IMAGE array\n(Lu\u00a8hr et al., 1998), and the SAMNET array (Yeoman et al.,\n1990). Data from selected stations will be presented inH ,D,\nZ coordinates, where H is local magnetic north, D is local\nmagnetic east, and Z is vertically down. These stations are\nindicated in Fig. 1b by the coloured circles, and their iden-\ntifier codes are also shown for reference. Data from those\nat lower latitudes and colour-coded red (i.e. PBQ, NAQ, and\nFAR) have been band-pass filtered (20\u2013200 s), to provide in-\nformation on substorm-related Pi2 signals. Those at latitudes\n\u223c70\u25e6\u201375\u25e6 and colour-coded blue (i.e. CON, IQA, and BJN)\nare distributed in longitude over the local time extent of the\nradar array, to give an indication of the overall magnetic ac-\ntivity during each interval. We will also show data from a\nnumber of sub-arrays, colour-coded yellow, which span in-\ndividual features at much higher spatial resolution, thus en-\nabling a more detailed analysis.\n2.3 LANL geostationary spacecraft data\nThe occurrence of energetic ion and electron injections at\ngeostationary orbit has been examined using data from the\nSOPA instruments carried by Los Alamos National Labo-\nA. Grocott at al.: Ionospheric flow during northward IMF 513\nratory (LANL) spacecraft (Belian et al., 1992). Data from\nthree operating spacecraft, 1994-084, 1989-046, and LANL-\n97A have been examined. During both intervals, LANL-97A\nwas located in the post-midnight sector, as appropriate for\nmonitoring electron injections. This data is, therefore, pre-\nsented here, being representative of the entire data set. The\nred coloured triangle on each map in Fig. 1b shows the iono-\nspheric footprint of LANL-97A, mapped from geostationary\norbit using the T-89 model (Tsyganenko, 1989). The black\nsolid line shows the footprint of a complete orbit.\n2.4 Polar auroral images\nImages of the aurora were provided by the VIS instrument\non the Polar spacecraft (Frank et al., 1995) during the inter-\nval on 2 December. This instrument viewed the whole of the\nnorthern polar ionosphere from the beginning of the interval\nat 01:30 UT up to \u223c03:00 UT, and provided images approx-\nimately every 5 min. These consist of 32.5 s integrations of\nUV photons at a wavelength of 130.4 nm. No images were\navailable for the interval on 14\/15 December.\n2.5 DMSP auroral particle data\nMeasurements of ion and electron fluxes by the SSJ\/4 in-\nstrument on board the DMSP F12, F13, and F14 spacecraft\n(Hardy et al., 1984) have been employed to examine the pat-\nterns of polar particle precipitation and their relationship to\nthe plasma flow. The instrument points toward zenith at all\ntimes, and provides 1 s resolution spectra of ion and electron\nfluxes between 30 eV and 30 keV.\n2.6 Upstream interplanetary parameters\nInterplanetary conditions during each interval were moni-\ntored by the ACE spacecraft (Stone et al., 1998), located\nat GSM coordinates (X,Y ,Z) = (222, 21,\u221225)RE during\nthe 2 December interval and (X,Y ,Z) = (226, 36,\u221215)RE\nduring the 14\/15 December interval. The variation of the\nspacecraft position over each interval was not significant.\nSolar wind and IMF data were obtained by the SWEPAM\nand MAG instruments, respectively (McComas et al., 1998;\nSmith et al., 1999). The propagation delay of field changes\nfrom ACE to the dayside ionosphere has been estimated us-\ning the algorithm of Khan and Cowley (1999). This esti-\nmate includes the propagation time in the solar wind up-\nstream of the bow shock, the frozen-in transit time across\nthe subsolar magnetosheath, and the Alfve\u00b4nic propagation\ntime along open field lines from the subsolar magnetopause\nto the cusp ionosphere. With solar wind proton number den-\nsities np \u223c15 cm\u22123 and speeds vp \u223c330 km s\u22121, we find a\npropagation delay of 76\u00b13 min for the 2 December interval.\nFor 14\/15 December, np was \u223c5 cm\u22123 and vp \u223c380 km s\u22121,\ngiving a propagation delay of 68\u00b15 min. These times have\nbeen used to lag the ACE solar wind and IMF data displayed\nhere. It should be noted that during the 2 December interval,\nno data were available from ACE\/SWEPAM from \u223c03:30 to\n\u223c06:30 UT. Therefore, we have used data from the Geotail\n \n10\n20\n30\n40\nn\np\n (\ncm\n-3\n)\n320\n340\n360\n380\nv p\n (\nkm\n s\n-1\n)\n-5\n0\n5\n10\nB\nx \n(n\nT\n)\n \n-15\n-10\n-5\n0\nB\ny \n(n\nT\n)\n \n-5\n0\n5\n10\nB\nz \n(n\nT\n)\n \n6\n8\n10\n12\n|B\n| (\nn\nT\n)\n20 00 04 08 1200 00 00 00 00\nUT\n0\n-45\n-90\n-135\n-180\nF ig. 2\nq \n(d\ne\ng\n)\nFig. 2.

SuperDARN line-of-sight ve-\nlocity measurements from the radar\nbeams indicated in Fig. 1a (left side) are\nshown for the interval 01:30\u201307:30 UT\non 2 Dec 1999. The vertical dashed\nlines show the centre times of 6 pulsed\nflow features, which are discussed in\ndetail in the text.\n3.1 Upstream interplanetary conditions\nIn Fig. 2 we present data from the ACE spacecraft, lagged by\n76 min via the method described above, for the 18-h interval\nfrom 19:30 UT on 1 December to 13:30 UT on 2 December\n1999. This is an expanded interval describing the upstream\ninterplanetary conditions for 6 h on either side of the interval\nof specific interest, which is delimited by the vertical dashed\nlines. The top two panels show the solar wind proton num-\nber density (np) and speed (vp) from ACE\/SWEPAM. Data\nwere unavailable for the \u223c3-h period, \u223c03:30\u201306:30 UT, as\nindicated above, so data from the Geotail CPI instrument\nhas been used to fill the gap (indicated on Fig. 2 by the\ndashed lines). Before the data gap, the density remained rel-\natively constant at \u223c10 cm\u22123 and the velocity between 330\u2013\n380 km s\u22121. The Geotail data indicates a decrease in velocity\nof \u223c30 km s\u22121 approximately coincident with the SWEPAM\ndata dropout. The middle three panels show the GSM com-\nponents of the IMF from ACE\/MAG, with the magnitude and\nclock angle of the field shown in the bottom two panels. IMF\nBx was near zero or positive throughout the main interval of\ninterest, while By was large and negative, and Bz predomi-\nnantly positive (and had been near zero or positive for more\nthan 3 h previously). These values translate to a field strength\nwhich was nearly constant at \u223c10\u00b11 nT, and a clock angle\nwhich, for the most part (\u223c02:30\u201306:30 UT), remained near\n\u223c\u221260\u25e6. The mean value over the main interval was \u221259\u25e6,\nwith a standard deviation of 17\u25e6.\n3.2 SuperDARN flow data overview\nIn Fig. 3 we present line-of-sight SuperDARN velocity data\nfor the 6-h interval, from the five radar beams shown by the\nred lines in the left-hand map in Fig. 1a.

There is also evidence of strong variabil-\nity or pulsing in the flow, which is particularly marked, for\nexample, at Goose Bay (beam 6). The vertical dashed lines\nindicate six such \u201cpulsed\u201d features in the flow, the details\nand timing of which will be discussed below. It is imme-\ndiately evident that this is an interval of dynamic and often\nhigh speed nightside flow.\nIn order to investigate the nature of the flow further, we\nhave derived a sequence of convection maps from all the\navailable SuperDARN data (in both hemispheres), using the\nMap Potential model. In Fig. 4a we present four representa-\ntive examples of the Northern Hemisphere flow pattern, im-\naged at 02:00, 04:00, 06:00 and 07:00 UT, which employ 2-\nmin resolution data from the six radars indicated in Fig. 1a.\nThe diagram in the bottom right-hand corner of each plot in-\ndicates the direction and strength of the concurrent (lagged)\nIMF projected onto the y\u2013z plane, emphasising again that al-\nthough these flow data span 5 h of UT, the IMF conditions\nremained very similar. Correspondingly, although the de-\ntails vary from plot to plot, the overall flow pattern also re-\nmained similar. It can be seen that the convection was consis-\ntently dominated by a large crescent-shaped \u201cdusk\u201d flow cell,\nwhich spanned the local time interval roughly from noon (the\ndetails being inaccessible due to the lack of post-noon day-\nside data), via dusk into the post-midnight hours. A clear\n\u201cdawn\u201d flow cell is present only in the map at 04:00 UT,\nwhere it is confined essentially to the dayside MLT quad-\nrant between dawn and noon. In general, the dawn sec-\ntor flows are highly structured and variable, and appear to\nbe essentially absent, for example, at 06:00 UT. The sense\nof the dawn-dusk flow asymmetry is exactly that expected\nfor Dungey-cycle flow driven in the presence of strong and\nconsistent negative IMF By (J\u00f8rgensen et al., 1972; Cowley,\n1981; Reiff and Burch, 1985; Heppner and Maynard, 1987;\nWeimer, 1995; Ruohoniemi and Greenwald, 1996).

Despite the northward direction of the IMF,\nthere is little evidence in these maps for the concurrent pres-\nence of high-latitude \u201clobe\u201d convection cells. However, as\nmentioned above, the lack of data coverage in the post-noon\ndayside quadrant makes this statement less than definitive.\nIf the Northern Hemisphere convection is due principally\nto IMF By-asymmetric Dungey-cycle flow, we would expect\nto observe similar flows in the Southern Hemisphere, but\nwith an oppositely-directed asymmetry between dawn and\ndusk. Examination of the Southern Hemisphere data shows\nthat the coverage is much more restricted than in the north,\nand backscatter is essentially absent after \u223c06:00 UT. There-\nfore, in Fig. 4b we show four selected maps from earlier in\nthe interval, at 02:04, 03:00, 04:08, and 05:00 UT, chosen\nto optimise the coverage. In order to aid comparison, these\nmaps are drawn as though viewed from the north, i.e. with\nnoon at the top and dusk to the left. Although the data are re-\nstricted, they are nevertheless compatible with a flow asym-\nmetry which is opposite to that which occurs in the north.\nIn particular, the data suggest the continuous presence of\nstrong antisunward and westward flows in the post-midnight\nand dawn sector polar cap, in a region where the Northern\nHemisphere flows are more sporadic but generally directed\neastwards.\nAs a further check on the nature and origin of the flow\npatterns, we have also examined all available DMSP particle\ndata and VIS auroral imagery during the interval, in order\nto determine the nature of the concurrent particle precipita-\ntion patterns (though, as noted above, VIS images are avail-\nable only until \u223c03:00 UT). On the basis of the above in-\nterpretation, we would expect the central region of the con-\nvection patterns where the flow is directed antisunward but\nwith an anti-clockwise vortical twist (in the Northern Hemi-\nsphere) to correspond to open field lines with cusp\/mantle\n(on the dayside) or polar rain (on the nightside) precipita-\ntion, while the surrounding region at lower latitudes should\ncorrespond to closed field lines with trapped BPS\/CPS pre-\nA.

The spacecraft position at the centre time\nof the VIS image (and also very nearly the centre time of\nthe SuperDARN scan) is indicated by the red triangle. The\ntrack is colour-coded by the nature of the precipitation ob-\nserved, i.e. CPS, BPS, cusp, and mantle. The data on which\nthese classifications are based are shown in standard spec-\ntrogram format in Fig. 5b. It can be seen that the regions\ndesignated as CPS\/BPS lie within the region of UV auroral\nemission, and sunward or clockwise vortical flow. The re-\ngion of \u201cmantle\u201d precipitation corresponds to the central re-\ngion of weak emission, and antisunward and anti-clockwise\nflow in the post-noon sector, while the \u201ccusp\u201d precipitation,\ntaken to be indicative of newly-opened dayside field lines,\nextends across the poleward boundary of the UV emission\nnear noon, in the region where the Map Potential streamlines\nturn poleward and eastward. Overall, these data (and those\nobtained in other VIS images and on other DMSP passes)\nprovide significant support for our interpretation of the ob-\nserved flows as asymmetrical Dungey-cycle convection pat-\nterns driven by dayside and nightside reconnection. In par-\nticular, the cusp\/mantle precipitation observed by DMSP on\nthe pass displayed here in itself constitutes direct evidence of\nongoing dayside reconnection.\nThe data in Figs. 3\u20135 are thus indicative of the essentially\ncontinuous presence of flow driven by open flux tube produc-\ntion at the magnetopause and destruction in the tail during\nthe interval. It is then important to emphasise that the ap-\nproximately constant size of the flow patterns seen in Fig. 4\nimplies an approximate balance in the dayside and nightside\nreconnection rates over the interval as a whole. It can be\nseen, for example, that the flow reversal boundary and im-\nplied open-closed field line boundary near midnight stays\nwithin a few degrees of \u223c75\u25e6 through the entire interval.\nJudging from the position of this boundary at various local\ntimes, the amount of open flux present in the system is typ-\nically \u223c4\u00d7108 Wb (see later for more detailed estimates).\nThe mean transpolar voltage for the entire interval was 35 kV,\ncorresponding, of course, to a magnetic flux throughput in\nthe flow system of \u223c35 kWb s\u22121. If this flow was associ-\nated with essentially unbalanced dayside reconnection and\nopen flux production, the amount of open flux that would\nbe created over the 6 h interval (across a small merging gap)\nwould be \u223c8\u00b7108 Wb, thus essentially tripling the amount of\nopen flux present in the system. Clearly this does not hap-\npen. Similarly, if the flow was associated with essentially\nunbalanced nightside reconnection at this rate, the polar cap\nwould contract to zero size in \u223c3 h. Clearly this also does\nnot happen. (In addition, we would not expect the IMF By-\nassociated flow asymmetry to persist in this case.) Rather,\nif we set a rough limit for the change in open flux over the\ninterval of say, \u223c1\u00b7108 Wb, corresponding to a change in the\noverall boundary position of \u223c2\u25e6, the implied difference in\nthe dayside and nightside reconnection rates averaged over\nthe 6 h of the interval is \u223c5 kV, small compared with the\noverall voltages deduced from the flow of \u223c35 kV. The flow\nmaps thus imply approximate balance between dayside and\nnightside reconnection rates, averaged over the whole inter-\nval, to within 10\u201315%. However, as we will show below, this\ndoes not imply that detailed balance occurs throughout, as\nthe pulsed nature of the nightside flows noted above already\nsuggests.\n3.3 Overview of substorm indicators\nGiven the implied existence of nightside reconnection at an\nappreciable averaged rate during this interval, it is of in-\nterest to enquire whether this process is expressed in terms\nof substorm expansions, as is characteristic of intervals of\nsouthward-directed IMF. Data relevant to this issue are sum-\nmarized in Fig. 6. The top three panels present H compo-\nnent magnetograms from the azimuthal magnetometer array\nat \u223c71\u25e6\u201373\u25e6 latitude (colour-coded blue in Fig. 1b), which\nwe examine for the presence of magnetic signatures, indica-\ntive of the formation of substorm electrojets. These stations\nA. Grocott at al.: Ionospheric flow during northward IMF 519\nare at a higher latitude than those at which substorm expan-\nsion onsets usually occur during or directly after intervals of\nsouthward IMF (\u223c65\u25e6), but they are relevant in the present\ncontext in view of the contracted nature of the flow patterns\ndisplayed in Figs. 4 and 5. We also confirm that they are rep-\nresentative of all the data from all the networks surveyed in\nthis study. These data show that the geomagnetic field was\n\u201cquiet\u201d during the whole interval, with no indications of im-\npulsive substorm activity. Field variations were continuously\npresent on time scales of several tens of minutes, but the am-\nplitudes were typically only a few tens of nT. There is some\nevidence of a relationship between these variations and those\nin the flow, marked by the vertical dashed lines, as in Fig. 3,\nand this will be discussed later.\nThe lack of impulsive substorm-like activity is emphasized\nin the next three panels of Fig. 6, which show representa-\ntive magnetic field data from lower-latitude stations (colour-\ncoded red in Fig. 1b), which have been filtered between 20\u2013\n200 s, corresponding to the Pi2 band. None of these data\n(including those from stations not shown here) indicate any\nimpulsive substorm-like Pi2 features, though the data from\nNAQ does indicate some continuous activity of amplitude\n\u223c1 nT during the first \u223c2 h of the interval. However, there\ndoes not appear to be any detailed correspondence between\nthis low-level activity and the times of the flow features dis-\ncussed above. Finally, the bottom panel of the figure shows\nrepresentative data from the geostationary energetic particle\nmonitors, specifically two channels of energetic electron data\nfrom spacecraft LANL97A, located in the dawn sector (see\nFig. 1b). Small periodic flux variations are evident over the\ninterval, but no injection signatures are present, or any ob-\nvious relationship to the flow features, as is indeed the case\nin the data from all the LANL spacecraft. Thus, if particle\ninjections from the tail did occur, they did not reach geosta-\ntionary orbit. Overall, therefore, we summarize our findings\nby stating that no indications of substorm bays, Pi2s, or geo-\nstationary orbit particle injections were observed during the\ninterval. The tail reconnection which occurred was, there-\nfore, not manifest as classic near-Earth substorm expansions.\nNevertheless, impulsive activity was indeed observed in the\nnightside flow, as noted above, and in the next section we\nturn to examine its behaviour in more detail.\n3.4 Nightside flow bursts\nWe now examine more closely the variability of the night-\nside flow, whose presence is already indicated in the data pre-\nsented in Figs. 3 and 4. In Fig. 7 we extract parameters from\nthe Map Potential plots which provide measures of the vari-\nability of the flow. The top panel shows the total transpolar\nvoltage in the flow maps, representing a measure of the total\nflux transport in the flow system. The level of confidence in\nthis parameter in general depends on the coverage of the po-\nlar ionosphere by the radar data. Examination shows that dur-\ning this interval the data generally do span the extrema in the\nvoltage values (see, e.g. Fig. 4), so that we may have reason-\nable confidence overall.

Flow maps illustrating the flow \u201cbursts\u201d indicated by the vertical dashed lines in Fig. 7, shown in the same format as Fig. 4. Eight\nselected maps are shown for each of the two burst intervals (a) 02:36\u201303:20 UT and (b) 05:02\u201305:30 UT. The exact time of each 2-min map is\nindicated in the top left-hand corner. Maps corresponding to the centre times of each of the other four bursts are shown in (c). Also indicated\non the maps by the black triangles are the locations of the magnetometer stations colour-coded yellow in Fig. 1b (Fig. 8 continues).\nthe bursty nature of the flow is evident. Typical values of\n\u223c500\u2013800 m s\u22121 are interspersed with \u223c10\u201315 min bursts,\nreaching up to \u223c1500 m s\u22121. The averaged value of the peak\nflow speed over the interval, 891 m s\u22121, is indicated by the\nhorizontal dotted line in this panel, emphasizing the peaks in\nthe flow. The most prominent and long-lived of these peaks\nare marked by the vertical dashed lines, these being the same\nlines as those shown previously in Figs. 3 and 6. Comparison\nwith the data in the upper panel of Fig. 7 shows that most of\nthe peaks in the speed also correspond to a peak in the trans-\npolar voltage. This indicates that an overall enhancement\nin the flux transport took place in association with the flow\nbursts, and not just a reconfiguration in the flow pattern.\nThe third panel of Fig. 7 shows the vector components of\nthe flow associated with the peak speed shown in the second\npanel. The solid line shows the westward flow component\n(perforce positive, since the peak flow speed displayed cor-\nresponds specifically to the westward flow of the \u201cdusk\u201d re-\nturn cell), while the dashed line shows the north-south flow\n(positive equatorward). These data show that, with the ex-\nception of the burst peaking at 07:16 UT, the peak flows all\noccur in the westward component. Concurrent changes in the\nnorth-south component are also observed, however, with en-\nhancements in the equatorward component often occurring in\nthe vicinity of the peak in the westward flow. The lower two\npanels of the figure also show the magnetic latitude and MLT\nof the location of the peak flow speed. It can be seen that\nthe latitude of the peak flow is generally located in the range\n73\u25e6\u201375\u25e6, and shows little trend during the interval, consistent\nwith our previous discussion concerning the lack of overall\nchange in the size of the flow system. Similarly, the local\ntime of the peak flow speed is scattered\u223c2\u20133 h on either side\nof midnight, and also shows no overall preference or trend.\n3.4.1 Flow burst geometry\nHaving investigated the overall nature of the nightside flow\ndata, we now examine in more detail the nature of the flow\nvariations which occur in two of the flow bursts, those cen-\ntred near (and indicated by the vertical lines at) 03:00 and\nA.

Figure 8a shows eight selected 2-min flow maps\nwhich span the first of these intervals, between 02:36 and\n03:20 UT. The black triangles in these plots show the po-\nsitions of key ground magnetometer sites whose data will\nbe examined below. The first map, for the 2-min interval\nstarting at 02:36 UT, is illustrative of the nature of the flow\nover the previous \u223c20-min interval. It shows a well-formed\nIMF By-asymmetric flow pattern of modest intensity, in ac-\ncordance with the overview presented above, with a well-\ndeveloped crescent-shaped \u201cdusk\u201d flow cell stretching from\nnoon via dusk to the post-midnight hours, together with a\nweaker rounder \u201cdawn\u201d flow cell which is centred in the pre-\nnoon sector. The transpolar voltage is estimated to have been\n35 kV. Over the next \u223c15 min, the dusk cell flow then grew\nin magnitude, with fast equatorward flows near midnight,\nand fast westward \u201creturn\u201d flows in the pre-midnight sec-\ntor, which eventually extended to the edge of the radar field\nof view at \u223c19 MLT. The transpolar voltage reached 44 kV\nat 02:52 UT, and remained at around that value for the next\n\u223c20 min. Rapid equatorward and westward flows were also\nobserved in the dawn sector after this time, which, bearing\nin mind the asymmetric nature of the flow pattern, could also\nhave been connected with the enhancements observed closer\nto midnight. The flow magnitude fell rapidly after 03:12 UT,\nhowever, such that the transpolar voltage reduced to values\nof \u223c35 kV by 03:20 UT, similar to that occurring before the\nburst.\nFigure 8b shows in the same format the development of a\nsecond flow burst during the interval from 05:02 to 05:30 UT.\nThe first map, starting at 05:02 UT, shows a weak flow pat-\ntern with a transpolar voltage of 31 kV, which is dominated\nby clockwise vortical \u201cdusk\u201d cell convection. The \u201creturn\u201d\nflows in the pre-midnight sector were relatively strong, how-\never, as had been the case for the previous \u223c20 min. These\nflows persisted until \u223c05:06 UT, when an enhancement be-\ngan in the pre-midnight sector, which developed over the next\n\u223c15 min into a predominantly azimuthal flow feature span-\nning some 6 h of MLT about the midnight meridian (within\nthe fields of view of the radars), and containing flows which\npeaked at \u223c1500 m s\u22121. Peak estimated transpolar voltages\nof \u223c40 kV occurred at \u223c05:20 UT, the flows then subse-\nquently declining to reach transpolar voltages of \u223c30 kV\nonce more after \u223c05:30 UT.\nOverall, the geometry of these two flow burst events are\n522 A.

In Fig. 8c we show a gallery of flow maps\ntaken from the centres of each of the remaining bursts that\noccurred during the interval, at the times indicated by the\nvertical dashed lines in Fig. 7. Within the limits of the radar\ndata coverage, each of them displays an enhancement in the\nwestward dusk cell \u201creturn\u201d flows in the pre-midnight-to-\nmidnight sector, with enhanced equatorward flows out of the\npolar cap in the midnight-to-post-midnight sector. The burst\ncentred at 01:44 UT also shows the presence of rapid equa-\ntorward flows in the dawn sector, with westward flows ex-\ntending into the pre-midnight sector, which may be a related\nphenomenon.\n3.4.2 Bursts as nightside reconnection events\nThe geometry of the flow surges revealed by the above anal-\nysis suggests that they are formed by bursts of enhanced re-\nconnection in the geomagnetic tail. If so, we might expect\nthem to be associated with overall poleward contractions in\nthe open-closed field line boundary and in the flow pattern.\nIt is evident from the flow maps shown in Fig. 8 that only in\ncertain cases do the flow data consistently define a sharp flow\nreversal boundary whose motion can be reasonably clearly\nfollowed over the duration of the burst, and then only over\na limited local time interval in the pre-midnight sector. It is\nprimarily for this reason that we make the following analysis\nof just the first of the two bursts discussed above. In Fig. 9 we\nshow data for the interval 02:30 to 03:30 UT. The top panel\nshows the transpolar voltage obtained from the Map Poten-\ntial plots, showing the enhancement in the overall flux trans-\nport during the burst, while the dashed vertical lines delimit\nthe central \u223c30-min interval of enhanced flows. The lower\npanel shows the latitude of the peak potential in the Map Po-\ntential plots in the pre-midnight sector, corresponding to the\neast-west flow reversal, specifically for 21 MLT (as dictated\nby the coverage of radar data). These values are quantized in\nunits of 1\u25e6 by the Map Potential algorithm. Again, the cen-\ntral \u223c30 min of enhanced flows are delimited by the vertical\ndashed lines.

Despite\nthis, and the evident scatter and the quantization, these data\ndo suggest the occurrence of a small poleward contraction\nof the boundary across the event, by \u223c1\u25e6\u20132\u25e6, from \u223c76\u25e6 to\n\u223c78\u25e6. Extrapolated around the boundary of the polar cap,\nsuch a displacement implies a net closure of open flux of\n\u223c1\u00b1108 Wb, due to enhanced tail reconnection exceeding\nthe concurrent dayside reconnection rate during the burst in-\nterval. The implied difference in rates is by several tens of\nkV averaged over the duration of the burst. In Sect. 5 below\nwe perform a more detailed analysis and attempt to quantify\nthe dayside and nightside reconnection rates during the burst\ninterval within the limitations of the available data.\n3.4.3 Burst magnetic signatures\nAlthough the above data suggest that the observed flow bursts\nare due to intervals of enhanced reconnection in the tail, we\nhave already demonstrated above that they are not associ-\nated with classic substorm features. However, small ampli-\ntude fluctuations do occur in the nightside magnetometer data\nduring the interval, and we now investigate the relationship\nof these variations with those in the flow data. In Fig. 10\nwe present magnetometer data for each of the two bursts,\nfrom the high-spatial resolution array (yellow dots) shown in\nFig. 1b. This array is also indicated by the black triangles\non each of the flow maps in Fig. 8. For each burst we show\nthe perturbation field superposed with the flow data from the\n220 km square bin corresponding to the location of the mag-\nnetometer (such that the location of the bin corotates with\nthe station). If the horizontal perturbations are due to over-\nhead Hall currents, then they should correlate with the flow\nvariations according to 1H \u221d 6HVW and 1D \u221d 6HVN ,\nwhere H and D are the northward and eastward components\nof the magnetic perturbation, respectively (as before), VW\nand VN are the westward and northward components of the\nflow, and 6H is the height-integrated ionospheric Hall con-\nductivity. Such simple relationships will not always hold,\nparticularly in high spatially structured circumstances, due\nto the integrating nature of ground-based magnetic observa-\ntions. However, they should be approximately valid here,\nwhere the spatial scale for variations in the flow is several\n524 A.

Panel (i) contains theH -component\nmagnetic field data (solid line), and the overhead westward\ncomponent of the flow (dashed line), as discussed above.\nAlthough the two curves do not agree everywhere, certain\nfeatures are present in both data sets. For example, an en-\nhancement in the flow at the location of BLC is accompa-\nnied by an increase in the local H -component. In panel (ii),\nwhich contains the D-component magnetic field data and the\nsimilarly-corresponding northward component of the flow\n(dashed line), there is also some correlation between the two.\nFor example, the enhanced equatorward flows seen at the lo-\ncation of IQA are accompanied by a coincident negative bay\nin the field. If we take values of \u223c1000 m s\u22121for the flow\nspeed, and magnetic perturbations of \u223c50 nT, then the im-\nA. Grocott at al.: Ionospheric flow during northward IMF 527\nplied value of 6H is just a few mho. Although as indicated\nabove, it can in general be dangerous to relate local fields\nand flow in this way; we can confirm that only low-amplitude\nmagnetic effects were observed over the whole array of sta-\ntions examined here. This, together with the general lack\nof consistent correspondence between the field perturbations\nand the flow, suggests that the auroral precipitation during\nthese events within the region of enhanced flow was very\nlow, certainly by comparison with substorm intervals. Fi-\nnally, panel (iii) contains the Z-component magnetic field\ndata which show similar fluctuations to the other two com-\nponents and a large negative deflection at \u223c03:10 UT. This\nfeature can also be identified in the H - and D-components,\nbut has no clear signature in the flow data.\nIn Fig. 10b we show the same magnetometer data band-\npass filtered between 20\u2013200 s, as discussed above. Station\nRAN measured the largest amplitude activity in the H - and\nD-components, but this does not appear to be related to the\ntime of the burst. At CHX, IQA, and BLC, however, there\nis some evidence of enhanced activity during the burst, al-\nthough this is of a more continuous nature, unlike the impul-\nsive Pi2-signatures typical of substorms.\nFigures 10c and d present data in the same format for the\nsecond burst. The magnetometer and flow data in Fig. 10c\nshow similar trends to those for the first burst, although there\nnow appears to be a rather clearer correlation between the\ntwo data sets in this case. This is particularly evident in the\nH -component magnetometer and east-west flow data. Again,\nthe amplitudes of the correlated perturbations are such that\nthe values of 6H implied by these data are no more than\na few mho, suggesting that, as in the previous example, no\nstrong conductivity changes are present and hence, no strong\nprecipitation. Figure 10d shows the filtered (20\u2013200 s) mag-\nnetometer data for this burst. The general picture is much the\nsame as for the first burst, with some small amplitude activity\nobserved at certain stations. In particular, there appears to be\na well-defined \u201conset\u201d of low-amplitude activity observed at\nCHX and BLC associated with the central time of the burst,\nat \u223c05:18 UT.\n3.5 Interval 1 summary\nWe now summarize our main findings. During this interval,\nin which an IMF clock angle of \u223c\u221260\u25e6 was maintained for\n\u223c6 h, dayside reconnection continued to drive Dungey-cycle\nflow in the magnetosphere-ionosphere system. It is found\nthat, over the entire interval, the size of the convection pat-\ntern remained relatively constant, implying that tail recon-\nnection was also ongoing, at an average rate approximately\nequal to that on the dayside. However, the usual substorm\ncycle did not occur, evidenced by the lack of magnetic bay\nsignatures at high latitudes, Pi2 signals, and geostationary or-\nbit energetic particle injections. Instead, \u223c1000 m s\u22121 bursts\nof flow were observed in the nightside ionosphere, lasting\na few tens of minutes and recurring every hour or so, ac-\ncompanied by weak magnetic signatures and low amplitude\nPi2-band (5\u201350 mHz) activity.

The for-\nmat is the same as Fig. 3.\nrelatively constant at \u223c5 cm\u22123 and the velocity between\n370\u2013420 km s\u22121. The IMF was also steady throughout the\nmain interval. Bx was near zero or negative, By was large\nand negative, and Bz was predominantly positive (and had\nbeen for the previous 6 h). This translates to a total field\nstrength of \u223c8\u00b12 nT, and a clock angle with a mean value\nof \u221251\u25e6 and a standard deviation of 15\u25e6. However, it may\nbe noted that a small change in the field occurred near the\nmiddle of the interval (\u223c00:30 UT), such that the field mag-\nnitude and clock angle were modestly increased in the later\nperiod compared with the earlier.\n4.2 SuperDARN flow data overview\nPresented in Fig. 12 are line-of-sight SuperDARN velocity\ndata from the five radar beams, shown by the red lines, in the\nright-hand map in Fig. 1a. In common with the previous in-\nterval, continuous flow was observed over the entire 6 hours,\nwith speeds of \u223c500\u20131000 m s\u22121. These flows are predom-\ninantly directed towards the radar at Goose Bay (beam 13)\nand Iceland East (beam 12), indicative of westward \u201creturn\u201d\nflows in an azimuthally extended dusk convection cell, and\naway from the radar at Iceland West (beam 3), indicative of\nsunward \u201creturn\u201d flow in the same cell. At Finland (beam 4)\nfor the early part of the interval and Iceland West (beam 8) for\nthe later part, the flows are both towards the radar in the more\npoleward ranges and away from the radar in the near ranges,\nindicative of equatorward flow out of the polar cap with a\nflow reversal in the auroral zone. Again, there is also evi-\ndence of strong variability in the flow, which is particularly\nmarked, for example, in the Iceland West data. However, this\nvariability is of a less regular nature than that observed during\nthe previous interval (see Fig. 3). The vertical dashed lines\nindicate episodes of high flow variability, which will be dis-\ncussed further in Sect. 4.3 below. To a first approximation,\nhowever, this is a similar interval to that discussed above,\nwith dynamic and often high speed flows, driven during an\ninterval of northward and By-dominated IMF.\nInspection of data relevant to the identification of sub-\nA. Grocott at al.: Ionospheric flow during northward IMF 529\nstorms (not shown here) also suggests that this is a similar\ninterval to that described above. The H -component mag-\nnetometer data again shows only small field variations of a\nfew tens of nT amplitude, indicative of a \u201cquiet\u201d geomag-\nnetic field, similar to that on 2 December shown in Fig. 6.\nThe lack of substorm activity is emphasized in the filtered\ndata, none of which indicates any impulsive substorm-like\nPi2 features. Representative data from the LANL97A SOPA\ninstrument (located in the dawn sector, as shown in Fig. 1b)\nalso indicate no injection signatures or indeed any significant\nvariations in the particle fluxes. Overall, therefore, this inter-\nval appears to be as devoid of substorm activity as the first.\nNevertheless, as mentioned above, impulsive nightside activ-\nity was again observed in the flow, which we now go on to\nexamine.\n4.3 Nightside flow bursts\nIn Fig. 13 we present flow parameters extracted from the Map\nPotential plots as before. The voltage values, again shown in\nthe top panel, lie typically between \u223c20 and \u223c40 kV. The\naverage over the interval was 29 kV. This is somewhat less\nthan the average during the first interval, possibly due to the\nslightly reduced IMF magnitude and clock angle. Neverthe-\nless, the values do exhibit a similar variability. The plot of\nthe peak nightside flow speed, however, appears to be di-\nvided into two distinct parts. The first half of the interval (up\nto \u223c00:30 UT) appears relatively quiet, with typical values\nof the peak flow around \u223c600\u2013800 m s\u22121 (close to the aver-\naged value of the flow speed over the full 6 h of 732 m s\u22121).\nOnly one apparent \u201cburst\u201d occurred, at \u223c22:40 UT. Then, af-\nter \u223c00:30 UT, the peak flows resemble more those during\nthe first interval, with regular burst-like features evident in\nthe data, reaching speeds up to \u223c1200 m s\u22121. This change\nin flow characteristic could be associated with the modest\nconcurrent change in IMF conditions which was noted in\nSect. 4.1. Those bursts which can be distinguished from\nthese data (and from a close inspection of the flow maps)\nhave been marked by the vertical dashed lines, correspond-\ning to those in Fig. 12. Comparison with the data in the upper\npanel of Fig. 13 shows that the peaks which have been iden-\ntified in the flow speed also generally correspond to peaks in\nthe transpolar voltage. This is consistent with our conclusion\nabout the bursts during the first interval, in that an overall\nenhancement in the flux transport took place in association\nwith the flow bursts. However, it is also evident that substan-\ntial enhancements in the transpolar voltage occurred at times\nwhen no flow speed excitation is apparent in the nightside\ndata. This generally occurred early in the interval, when the\nradar coverage included a significant portion of the dayside\nionosphere, and, as can be inferred from the flow maps, the\nvoltage enhancements were then significantly influenced by\nthe dayside driven component of the flow.\nThe vector components of the peak flow also show a sim-\nilar trend to the corresponding data from the first interval.\nThe bursts tend to peak in the westward direction (indicated\nby the solid line), with relatively little enhancement in the\n2100 2200 2300 0000 0100 0200 0300\nUT\nM\nL\nT\n (\nh\nrs\n.)\n \n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n \n400\n600\n800\n1000\n1200\n1400\n \n \n-500\n0\n500\n1000\n1500\n \n65\n70\n75\n80\n85\nV\n (\nm\n s\n-1\n)\n18\n20\n22\n00\n02\n04\n06\nM\na\ng\n. \nL\na\nt.\nV\nW\n\/V\nS\n (\nm\n s\n-1\n)\nF ig. 13\nV\nP\nC\nFig. 13.

This is\nagain consistent with our previous discussion concerning the\nlack of overall change in the size of the flow pattern. There\nis some scatter in the local time of the peak flow speed, al-\nthough around the times of the bursts, specifically in the sec-\nond half of the interval, the flows did tend to peak consis-\ntently within 1\u20132 h of midnight.\n4.3.1 Flow burst geometry\nAs indicated above, the variability of the flows observed here\ndiffers somewhat from that observed during the first inter-\nval, particularly in the initial period. Although the back-\nground flow pattern is similar, being driven under the in-\nfluence of large negative IMF-By , the tail does not seem to\nrespond with quite the same impulsive regularity as before.\nIn Fig. 14a we present four representative examples of the\nNorthern Hemisphere flow pattern, from 21:30 UT on 14 De-\ncember to 00:30 UT on 15 December, representative of the\n530 A.

Although\nthe details vary from plot to plot, the overall flow patterns\nremain similar to each other, and to that observed during the\nprevious interval (see Fig. 4a). Due to the earlier UT of this\ninterval, however, there is much better coverage of data in\nthe post-noon sector, which shows the existence of dayside\nanti-sunward flows in the throat of the convection cells, in-\ndicative of dayside reconnection. There is also some evi-\ndence early on in the interval for the concurrent presence of\nhigh-latitude \u201clobe\u201d convection cells. Later in the interval,\nin the map at 00:30 UT, for example, a \u201cdawn\u201d flow cell is\nalso apparent, confined essentially to the same dayside MLT\nquadrant between dawn and noon as in the previous inter-\nval. In general, however, the lack of data in the dawn hours\nmakes it difficult to draw conclusions about the nature of the\nflows in that sector. The extended nature of the dusk flow cell\ndoes, nevertheless, imply the existence of the expected dawn-\ndusk flow asymmetry, which is corroborated by the Southern\nHemisphere data (not shown). These data again show much\nmore restricted coverage than in the north, but are consis-\ntent with the opposite asymmetry in the flow. Examination\nof all available DMSP particle data for the interval provides\nsimilar corroboration of the open nature of the polar cap. A\nnumber of Southern Hemisphere overpasses by the F13 and\nF14 spacecraft, in particular, provided good evidence of a\nband of CPS\/BPS precipitation at \u223c75\u25e6 (observed at 21, 05,\nand 09 MLT), with lower energy polar cap precipitation pole-\nwards of this.\nAlthough this interval is, therefore, not identical to the\nfirst, it is important to point out that some bursts are still\nobserved, particularly in the second half. The centre times\nof five enhancements in the flow are indicated in Fig. 13 by\nthe vertical dashed lines at 22:40, 00:52, 01:30, 02:10, and\n02:40 UT. As mentioned above, the first half of the interval\nsees only one distinctive burst (the start of which can be seen\nin the 22:30 UT map of Fig. 14a). In this instance, the burst\ntakes the form of enhanced sunward return flows in the dusk\nconvection cell. During the second half of the interval, when\nthe flow variability was enhanced, the bursts begin to take the\nform of azimuthal flows in the midnight sector, more like the\nbursts observed during the first interval. However, they are\nnoticeably less discrete than before, with the flows varying\nA.

Therefore, in Fig. 14b we show four flow maps which\nspan this burst between 01:54 and 02:18 UT. The black trian-\ngles again show the positions of key ground magnetometer\nsites whose data will be examined below. The first map, start-\ning at 01:54 UT, is illustrative of the nature of the flow over\nthe \u223c20-min period since the end of the previous burst. It\nshows an IMF By-asymmetric flow pattern, with evidence of\nsome enhancement of the westward flow near midnight, and\na relatively low transpolar voltage of 24 kV. Over the next\n\u223c20 min, the westward flow in the midnight sector grew in\nmagnitude, peaking at 02:10 UT, with a corresponding peak\nin transpolar voltage of 38 kV. In the third map, showing this\ncentral time of the burst, the flow enhancement consists pri-\nmarily of westward flows spanning magnetic midnight, sim-\nilar to a number of the bursts observed during the first inter-\nval. Over the following\u223c10 min the flows subsided, with the\ntranspolar voltage falling to 24 kV by 02:18 UT.\nThe main conclusion we wish to draw is that, as in the\nfirst interval, continuous quasi-steady Dungey-cycle flow\nwas driven during this 6-h interval of steady interplanetary\nconditions. This implies again that there must be a consis-\ntent nightside reconnection-driven element to the flow which\nis balancing the observed dayside driving, but which is not\nmanifest as typical substorm phenomena.\n4.3.2 Burst magnetic signatures\nIn Fig. 15 we present magnetometer data for the \u223c02:10 UT\nburst from the high-spatial resolution array shown in the\n00:00 UT map in Fig. 1b. Figure 15a presents unfiltered\nmagnetic data along with the corresponding flow compo-\nnents, in the same format as in Fig. 10. Panel (i) contains\nthe H -component magnetic field data (solid line), and the\noverhead westward component of the flow (dashed line). As\nfound for the bursts during the first interval, there is no con-\nsistent correlation between the two data sets. Certain fea-\ntures are present in both, for example, an enhancement in\nthe flow at the location of SKT is accompanied by an in-\ncrease in the local H -component. In the D-component and\nthe corresponding northward flow (dashed line), shown in\npanel (ii), there is a similar correlation.

The IMF clock angle re-\nmained relatively constant at\u223c\u221250\u25e6, somewhat smaller than\nfor the first interval, and the field intensity remained between\n6 and 8 nT, also somewhat smaller than before. Dayside re-\nconnection again continued to drive Dungey-cycle flow, al-\nthough it was observed to be weaker than during the first\ninterval, possibly due to the reduced clock angle and field\nstrength. As before, it was found that the size of the con-\nvection pattern remained relatively constant over the entire\ninterval, thus implying that tail reconnection was again on-\ngoing at an average rate approximately equal to that at the\ndayside. The lack of substorm phenomena was again evi-\ndenced in the magnetic and geostationary orbit energetic par-\nticle data, while a detailed investigation of the flow data re-\nvealed that similar nightside flow bursts occurred. However,\nonly one clear burst was observed during the first half of the\ninterval, with more frequent \u201cbursty\u201d activity occurring dur-\ning the second half. This change in the nature of the flow co-\nincided with a small change in the IMF conditions, in which\nthe field magnitude was slightly increased and the clock an-\ngle slightly reduced. Nevertheless, the basic nature of the\nbursts appears to be similar to those observed during the first\ninterval.\n5 Reconnection rates during burst intervals\nThe analysis of the principal nightside flow bursts described\nabove shows that the transpolar voltage is enhanced during\nthe bursts, and also suggests (somewhat less strongly) that a\nmodest poleward displacement takes place in the nightside\nopen-closed field line boundary (see Fig. 9). These features\nindicate that the bursts are associated with enhancements in\nthe nightside reconnection rate. In this section we analyse\nthese data further, and attempt to quantify the reconnection\nrates within the limitations of the information available. The\ntheoretical framework of our discussion is the Cowley and\nLockwood (1992) paradigm of reconnection-associated flow\nexcitation, leading to the reconnection-rate formulas derived\npreviously by Grocott et al. (2002).\nThe physical situation which applies here is shown in\nFig. 16 (where for simplicity the By-associated asymmetry is\nnot represented), in which we assume that dayside and night-\nside reconnection are both continuously present, but that the\nrate of flux closure on the nightside exceeds that on the day-\nside, such that overall, the polar cap contracts. In this di-\nagram the segments of the open-closed field line boundary\nmapping to the reconnection sites (i.e. the \u201cmerging gaps\u201d)\nare shown by the dot-dashed lines, while the adiaroic seg-\nments of the boundary (which are not so connected and\nwhich thus move with the flow) are shown by the heavy solid\nlines. The lighter arrowed lines show the plasma streamlines.\nF ig. 16\nFig. 16. Schematic of the flow situation appropriate to the burst in-\ntervals examined here, in which dayside and nightside reconnection\nare both continuously present, but with the rate of flux closure on\nthe nightside exceeding the rate of open flux creation at the day-\nside, such that overall the polar cap contracts. The segments of the\nopen-closed field line boundary mapping to the reconnection sites\n(i.e. the \u201cmerging gaps\u201d) are shown by the dot-dashed lines, while\nthe adiaroic segments of the boundary (which are not so connected\nand which thus move with the flow) are shown by the heavy solid\nlines. The lighter arrowed lines again show the plasma streamlines,\nand the large arrows show the implied boundary motion.\nThe action of the flow is to transport closed flux from the\nmerging gap region of closure sunward to other local times,\nsuch as (in effect) to distribute the newly-closed flux around\nthe boundary. In the Cowley-Lockwood paradigm the flux\nis distributed uniformly round the boundary, such that it con-\ntracts with its shape unchanged. A key feature of the diagram\nis that the foci of the plasma flow cells under these circum-\nstances will be located near the ends of the nightside merging\ngap (see also, e.g. Siscoe and Huang, 1985). At these points\nthe plasma flow across the boundary will reverse from be-\ning directed equatorward in the sector of the merging gap, to\nbeing poleward in the contracting adiaroic sector on either\nside. Thus, we expect in this case that the total transpolar\nvoltage (as estimated from the SuperDARN radar data) will\ncorrespond to the ionospheric voltage across the nightside\nmerging gap. By the same argument, when dayside recon-\nnection dominates, the transpolar voltage will correspond in-\nstead to the ionospheric voltage across the dayside merging\ngap. These conclusions would not follow if, for example,\nsignificant voltages are also present associated with \u201clobe\u201d\nconvection cells. However, as indicated above, we have not\nfound evidence for a substantial contribution from such flows\ncells in the data examined here.\nUnder these conditions, Grocott et al. (2002) have shown\nthat the nightside and dayside reconnection rates averaged\nover some interval \u03c4, \u30088\u02d9n\u3009 and \u30088\u02d9d\u3009, respectively, can be\nestimated from\n\u30088\u02d9n\u3009 \u2248 \u2212\u3008VPC\u3009 + fmgBi 1A\n\u03c4\nand (1a)\n534 A.

In these\nequations \u3008VPC\u3009 is the averaged polar cap voltage, as ob-\ntained from the SuperDARN data (assumed equal to the volt-\nage across the nightside merging gap, as indicated above),\nBi is the polar magnetic field strength (taken to be constant\nfor simplicity and equal to 60 000 nT), 1A is the change in\nthe area of open flux over the interval (negative for a con-\ntraction), and fmg is the fraction of that area associated with\nthe motion of the nightside merging gap. If the contraction\nis uniform, as assumed in the Cowley-Lockwood paradigm,\nthen fmg is also equal to the fraction of the total length of\nthe open-closed field line boundary occupied by the night-\nside merging gap.\nExamining Eq. (1) we can see that if 1A \u2248 0 for a par-\nticular interval (as is true overall for the intervals considered\nhere), then the magnitudes of the mean dayside and night-\nside reconnection rates are both equal to the mean polar cap\nvoltage \u3008VPC\u3009. On the other hand, if the polar cap area con-\ntracts during the interval, such that 1A < 0, then the mag-\nnitude of the nightside reconnection rate will be greater than\n\u3008VPC\u3009, while that of the dayside reconnection rate will be\nless than \u3008VPC\u3009. An inconsistency occurs if the magnitude of\nthe second term in Eq. (1b) exceeds the first, implying that\n\u30088\u02d9d\u3009 is negative, contrary to assumption. If this is found\nto be the case, the implication is that the closed flux is not\ndistributed uniformly around the boundary by the flow as as-\nsumed. However, for the events analysed here, a more strin-\ngent condition on \u30088\u02d9d\u3009 may be considered, since we have\nargued in the present case that, over the interval as a whole\nthe dayside and nightside reconnection rates must be in ap-\nproximate balance. Thus, in the absence of an unlikely anti-\ncorrelation between the dayside and nightside reconnection\nrates, the value of \u30088\u02d9d\u3009 during the nightside burst events\nshould not generally differ greatly from the polar cap volt-\nage averaged over the whole interval. For the first 6-h inter-\nval considered here (on 2 December), the transpolar voltage\naveraged over the whole interval determined from the Super-\nDARN data was \u223c35 kV, while for the second (on 14\/15 De-\ncember) it was \u223c28 kV (see Figs. 7 and 13).\nWe now use Eqs. (1a) and (1b) to estimate the reconnec-\ntion rates during the first burst interval. As discussed in\nSect. 3.4.2, this is the only burst of the three studied in detail\nhere in which the radar data clearly define the flow reversal\nboundary. If we examine these equations, it is clear that some\nof the parameters on the right-hand sides are determined by\nthe data better than others. In particular, the mean polar cap\nvoltage \u3008VPC\u3009 during the burst is reasonably well determined\nfrom the SuperDARN data, while the net area swept out by\nthe open-closed field line boundary 1A and the fraction fmg\nof that associated with the nightside merging gap are not so\nwell determined. With regard to fmg , values can be estimated\nby inspection of the flow patterns during the burst interval.\nWe have argued above that the maximum and minimum in\nthe electric potential lie at either end of the nightside merg-\ning gap, under the nightside \u201cburst\u201d conditions investigated\nhere. Identification of the location of the foci of the flow cells\nprovides, therefore, an indication of the magnetic local time\nextent of the merging gap, from which fmg can be estimated.\nHowever, with regard to the change in polar cap area, we\nhave been able to make only an approximate determination\nof the poleward displacement of the boundary, quantized in\n1\u25e6 latitude steps, in one nightside local time sector, where a\nclearly defined flow reversal is evident. As in the study by\nGrocott et al. (2002), our approach has been, therefore, to\nlook at the sensitivity of the results to these less-well deter-\nmined parameters.\nWhat we have done (in effect) is to plot a contour map of\n\u30088\u02d9n\u3009 and \u30088\u02d9d\u3009 on the fmg \u2212 1A plane, and to delineate re-\ngions of consistency both with the rather roughly obtained\nlimits on these latter parameters, and on \u30088\u02d9d\u3009, as discussed\nabove. However, rather than use 1A directly, we have used\ninstead the latitude displacement of the boundary in the local\ntime sector in which this has been determined via the analy-\nsis presented above (in Fig. 9). From this displacement the\nareas 1A have been calculated by extrapolation of the initial\nand final boundary positions to other local times. Specif-\nically, we have assumed for simplicity (and in accordance\nwith the Cowley-Lockwood paradigm) that the initial and\nfinal boundaries are circles drawn about a common centre.\nThe chosen centre is displaced from the magnetic pole by\n2\u25e6 of magnetic latitude towards the nightside, this also being\nthe chosen \u201ccentre\u201d of the spherical harmonic analysis of the\nSuperDARN data. Examination of the flow patterns overall\nindicates that this is a very reasonable choice, and that no\nsubstantial improvement would result from attempting to use\nsome more complicated boundary shape.\nOur results for the burst occurring during 02:46\u201303:15 UT\non 2 December are shown in Fig. 17, based on the data shown\nin Fig. 9. Here reconnection rate contours are plotted on the\nfmg \u221213B plane, where fmg is shown on the vertical axis,\nand the displacement of the magnetic latitude of the flow re-\nversal boundary 13B during the event is shown on the hor-\nizontal axis. From the latter parameter we have then cal-\nculated the change in area of the polar cap according to the\nabove algorithm, starting from an initial boundary position at\n3B = 76\u25e6 in this case (Fig. 9), so that 1A becomes increas-\ningly negative as we move from left to right across the plot.\nFor this event we find that a 1\u25e6 poleward displacement of\nthe boundary in the 21:00 MLT sector corresponds to a flux\nclosure of Bi1A \u2248 \u22120.6\u00d7108 Wb, while 2\u25e6 corresponds to\n\u22121.1\u00d7108 Wb and 3\u25e6 to \u22121.5\u00d7108 Wb. Using a value of\nthe averaged transpolar voltage of \u3008VPC\u3009 = 42 kV for the in-\nterval, determined from the data shown in Fig. 9, we have\nthen plotted contours of \u30088\u02d9n\u3009 and \u30088\u02d9d\u3009, shown by the solid\nand dashed lines, respectively. At the left-hand edge of the\nplot we have 13B = 0 (and 1A = 0), so that at this limit\nEqs. (1a) and (1b) give \u30088\u02d9d\u3009 = \u2212\u30088\u02d9n\u3009 = \u3008VPC\u3009, as discussed\nabove. We also have \u30088\u02d9n\u3009 = \u2212\u3008VPC\u3009 along the bottom edge\nof the plot, where fmg = 0, and \u30088\u02d9d\u3009 = \u3008VPC\u3009 along the top\nedge of the plot, where fmg = 1.

The dark-shaded area in the bottom right corner of each\nplot represents an area of inconsistent results where the dayside reconnection rate becomes negative. The horizontal dotted lines mark the\nlikely range of fmg for the event (obtained from the SuperDARN maps), with the exterior region shown shaded. Also shaded is the region\nof unreasonable dayside reconnection rates as discussed in the text. The remaining unshaded area corresponds to the region of solutions that\nconforms to all of these constraints. These results are plotted for the 03:00 UT burst on 2 Dec.\ntive boundaries, \u30088\u02d9n\u3009 becomes increasingly negative as fmg\nand 13B both increase, while \u30088\u02d9d\u3009 drops to smaller values\nas fmg decreases and 13B increases. Eventually, \u30088\u02d9d\u3009 be-\ncomes negative in the dark-shaded area in the bottom right\ncorner of the plot, this representing an area of inconsistent\nresults (as discussed above) when (1\u2212 fmg 1A becomes too\nnegative.\nWe now consider the likely ranges of the controlling pa-\nrameters, and the consequent likely range of values of the re-\nconnection rates. First, examination of the flow maps during\nthe interval indicates that the nightside merging line is rela-\ntively extended, with fmg lying in the range \u223c0.35 to 0.65,\ncorresponding to 0.15 on either side of the average value for\nthe duration of the burst. This range is marked by the hori-\nzontal dotted lines, with the exterior region shown as shaded.\nSecond, according to the above argument, we can reason-\nably expect the dayside reconnection rate to have fallen in\nthe range \u223c30 to \u223c40 kV, corresponding to 5 kV on either\nside of the total transpolar voltage, averaged over the whole\n6-h interval of observations. The region outside these limits\nis also shaded. The remaining unshaded area then represents\nthe solutions which are compatible with both of these con-\nstraints. The location of this area first suggests an overall\npoleward boundary displacement between \u223c0.5\u25e6 and \u223c1\u25e6,\nreasonably consistent with the \u223c1\u25e6 displacement inferred in\nFig. 9. It also suggests nightside reconnection rates of \u223c45\u2013\n60 kV, which thus exceed concurrent dayside rates by 10\u2013\n20 kV.\nThe implication of these results is that during the burst\ninterval examined here, the nightside reconnection rate ex-\nceeded the dayside reconnection rate by 50%. Under con-\nditions of weak northward-directed, but By-dominated IMF,\ntherefore, it appears that the flow continues to be dominated\nby Dungey-cycle flow, as it is during intervals of southward-\ndirected IMF, and the \u201creturn\u201d flow from the tail is often\nbursty and sporadic. However, our data also show that these\nbursts are not accompanied by phenomena characteristic of\nsubstorms, such as enhanced auroral zone conductivities,\nmagnetic bays, Pi2s, or geostationary energetic particle in-\njections. It seems likely that the impulsive phenomena con-\ncerned, while possibly being related physically to substorms,\nwere taking place considerably further down the tail than is\ntypical of more strongly-driven intervals.\n6 Summary and conclusions\nWe have discussed the ionospheric flow and magnetic distur-\nbance which occurred during two 6-h near-steady intervals\nof northward, but By-dominated IMF. During the first inter-\nval, on 2 December 1999, the average IMF clock angle was\n\u223c\u221260\u25e6 and the field strength was\u223c10 nT. During the second\ninterval, on 14\/15 December 1999, the average IMF clock\nangle was \u223c\u221250\u25e6, and the field strength was \u223c7 nT. Both\nsets of conditions gave rise to similar continuous flows in the\npolar ionosphere, with a highly asymmetric twin-vortex pat-\ntern being observed, consistent with directly driven Dungey-\ncycle convection. This flow was slightly weaker during the\nsecond interval compared with the first (the mean transpolar\nvoltage was 29 kV compared to 35 kV), possibly due to the\nreduced IMF clock angle and field strength. On shorter time\nscales, however, the flow exhibited intervals of strong vari-\nability in the nightside ionosphere, which differed slightly in\nnature between the two intervals. During the 2 December in-\nterval, \u223c1000 m s\u22121 bursts of flow were observed in the mid-\n536 A. Grocott at al.: Ionospheric flow during northward IMF\nnight sector, lasting a few tens of minutes and recurring every\nhour or so. They were accompanied by weak magnetic sig-\nnatures (\u223c10 nT) and low amplitude Pi2-band (5\u201350 mHz)\nactivity, although it is not clear that either were directly asso-\nciated. During the 14\/15 December interval, the bursts were\nobserved to be less regular, with only one discernable event\noccurring during the first half of the interval. During the sec-\nond half, the bursts become more frequent, but appear to be\nless distinct from one another than those observed during the\nfirst interval.\nOver the entire 6 h of each interval, it was observed that\nthe size of the convection pattern remained relatively con-\nstant. This implies that tail reconnection was ongoing, at an\naverage rate approximately equal to that at the dayside mag-\nnetopause. However, the nightside flow observations then in-\ndicate that this reconnection typically was not steady, but un-\nderwent sporadic enhancements, giving rise to the flow burst\nintervals. This is indicated by the fact that each burst was ac-\ncompanied by an enhancement in the total transpolar voltage,\nand in one example, where the flow reversal boundary was\nwell observed, appeared to be coincident with a small (\u223c1\u25e6)\ncontraction of the polar cap boundary. These bursts are,\ntherefore, likely to be an ionospheric manifestation of con-\nvective transport away from a distant tail reconnection site. A\nsimple model of this process, based on the Cowley and Lock-\nwood (1992) picture of reconnection-associated flow excita-\ntion, has enabled us to make an estimate of the nightside re-\nconnection rate associated with one of these burst intervals,\nbased on assumed limits on the dayside rate. We estimate\nthat, during this burst, the nightside reconnection rate was\nelevated typically to values \u223c45\u201360 kV, thus exceeding the\nlikely concurrent dayside reconnection rates of \u223c30\u201340 kV\nby 50%. Bearing in mind the fact that over the full 6 h of each\ninterval, the polar cap remains relatively constant in size,\nthis also implies a \u201cnon-burst\u201d nightside reconnection rate\nof \u223c20\u201325 kV. While not manifest as substorms, these dis-\ncrete bursts of enhanced tail reconnection seem clearly to be\na related phenomenon occurring, as suggested above, much\nfurther down-tail. In effect, we have demonstrated that while\nunder conditions of southward IMF, the Dungey cycle will\nusually be manifest as the substorm cycle; the two are not, in\nfact, synonymous. Intermediate interplanetary conditions ex-\nist, such as those considered here, in which the Dungey cycle\ncontinues to drive the system, but without evidence of classic\nsubstorms being observed (though tail activity appears still to\nbe pulsed on \u223c1-h time scales). The question remains as to\nexactly what range of interplanetary conditions gives rise to\na tail response of this nature. We also need to investigate the\ncorresponding picture for positive By-dominated IMF. These\nquestions, however, remain the subject of future work.\nAcknowledgements.
