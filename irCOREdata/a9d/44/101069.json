The results, interpreted using state-of-the-art nuclear shell-model\ncalculations, show no evidence of an N \u0002 82 shell quenching at Z \u0002 48. They allow us to follow nuclear\nisomerism throughout a full major neutron shell from 98Cd50 to 130Cd82 and reveal, in comparison with\n76Ni48 one major proton shell below, an apparently abnormal scaling of nuclear two-body interactions.\nDOI: 10.1103\/PhysRevLett.99.132501 PACS numbers: 21.60.Cs, 23.20.Lv, 26.30.+k, 27.60.+j\nThe pioneering work of Goeppert-Mayer [1] and Haxel,\nJensen, and Suess [2] in realizing that the experimental\nevidence for nuclear magic numbers could be explained by\nassuming a strong spin-orbit interaction constituted a ma-\njor milestone in our understanding of the internal structure\nof the atomic nucleus. However, it has been recognized for\nmore than 20 years that the single-particle ordering which\nunderlies the shell structure (and with it the magic num-\nbers) may change for nuclei approaching the neutron dri-\npline. It has been argued that the neutron excess causes the\ncentral potential to become diffuse, leading to a modifica-\ntion of the single-particle spectrum of neutron-dripline\nnuclei [3,4]. In addition, a strong interaction between the\nenergetically bound orbitals and the continuum also affects\nthe level ordering. The consequence of these modifications\ncan be a shell quenching; i.e., the shell gaps at magic\nneutron numbers are less pronounced in very neutron-\nrich nuclei than in nuclei closer to stability. At the extreme,\nthese gaps may even disappear. Alternatively, the tensor\npart of the nuclear force has been shown to cause shell\nreordering for very asymmetric proton and neutron num-\nbers [5,6].\nThe N \u0002 82 isotones below the doubly magic nucleus\n132Sn are crucial for stellar nucleosynthesis due to the close\nrelation between the N \u0002 82 shell closure and the A \u0003 130\npeak of the solar r-process abundance distribution. Based\non the mass models available at that time, it was shown in\nthe 1990s that the assumption of a quenching of the N \u0002\n82 neutron shell closure leads to a considerable improve-\nment in the global abundance fit in r-process calculations\n[7,8], in particular, a filling of the troughs around A \u0003 120\nand 140. On the other hand, recently, alternative descrip-\ntions of the phenomenon have been given without invoking\nshell quenching at all [9,10]. Unfortunately, the very\nPRL 99, 132501 (2007) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending28 SEPTEMBER 2007\n0031-9007=07=99(13)=132501(5) 132501-1 \u00a9 2007 The American Physical Society\nneutron-rich N \u0002 82 waiting-point nuclei are still out of\nreach experimentally. However, recent spectroscopic ob-\nservations in nuclei close to 132Sn have been interpreted as\nthe first experimental evidence of a quenching of the N \u0002\n82 shell closure in 130Cd [11,12], much closer to 132Sn than\npredicted by any calculation. One such observation con-\ncerns the low excitation energy of 957 keV tentatively\nproposed for the 2\u0001 state of this nucleus [11].\nIn this Letter, we present the identification of an iso-\nmeric decay in 130Cd, representing the most neutron-rich\nN \u0002 82 waiting-point nucleus in which \u0001-ray transitions\nhave been observed to date. The results present the most\ndirect information with respect to any possible modifica-\ntion of the N \u0002 82 shell gap close to 132Sn.\nIsomer spectroscopy was performed to search for an\nI\u0002 \u0002 8\u0001 isomer in 130Cd. Such an isomeric state,\nbased on a maximally aligned pair of proton holes in\nthe g9=2 orbit, was expected to exist in this nucleus in\nanalogy to the 8\u0001 isomer observed in the valence analog\nCd isotope 98Cd50 [13]. The experiment was performed\nat the Gesellschaft fu\u00a8r Schwerionenforschung (GSI),\nDarmstadt, Germany. In the first part, 130Cd was produced\nvia 6-proton knockout from a 136Xe projectile accelerated\nto 750 MeV=u by the SIS-18 synchrotron and impinging\non a 4 g=cm2 Be target. In the second part of the experi-\nment, 130Cd ions were produced using projectile fission of\na 238U beam at an energy of 650 MeV=u and a 1 g=cm2 Be\ntarget. They were separated from other reaction products\nand identified ion by ion in the GSI fragment separator\n(FRS) [14] via the measurement of the energy loss, the\nmagnetic rigidity, the positions in the intermediate and the\nfinal focal plane, and the time of flight in the second half of\nthe FRS. Figure 1 illustrates the identification of the differ-\nent Cd isotopes.\nThe fraction of the nuclei implanted in an excited iso-\nmeric state in a passive stopper at the spectrometer focal\npoint was 10%\u201320% of the total population. These iso-\nmeric states then decay to the ground state by \u0001-ray\nemission. These \u0001 rays were detected by 15 large volume\nGe cluster detectors [15] from the former EUROBALL\n[16] spectrometer arranged in close geometry around the\nstopper. With the requirement of a delayed coincidence\nrelationship between the implanted ion and the detected\n\u0001 ray, the radiation can be unequivocally assigned to the\ndecay of an isomeric state of a particular isotope. It should\nbe stressed that only the unprecedented high gamma de-\ntection efficiency and granularity of the Ge array [17]\navailable within the rare isotope spectroscopic investiga-\ntion at GSI experimental campaign, in conjunction with the\nclean identification after fragmentation reactions at rela-\ntivistic energies, allowed for the first time observation of\nisomeric decays in 130Cd despite its very low production\ncross section.\nThe data for 130Cd obtained from the two parts of the\nexperiment have been combined. Figure 2 (top row) shows\nthe spectrum of \u0001 rays observed in delayed coincidence\nwith a total of about 6300 identified and implanted 130Cd\nions. In this spectrum, four transitions are clearly observed\nwith energies of 128, 138, 539, and 1325 keV, respectively.\nFIG. 1 (color online). Example of particle identification plots\nfrom the fragmentation of 136Xe. Left: Z identification from the\nenergy losses measured in two multiple sampling ionization\nchamber ionization chambers.

The inset\nshows the time distribution between the ion implantation and the\ndetection of one of the four \u0001 rays. The lower panels show the \u0001\nspectra observed in coincidence with the 128, 138, 539, and\n1325 keV transitions, respectively.\nPRL 99, 132501 (2007) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending28 SEPTEMBER 2007\n132501-2\nSince all of these transitions are observed in mutual coin-\ncidence as evidenced by the coincidence spectra included\nin Fig. 2, we may assume that they form a single cascade\nfrom one isomeric state to the ground state. Assuming that\nthe transitions within the cascade have identical intensities,\nthe missing gamma yield for the two low-energy transi-\ntions can be attributed to internal conversion. In Table I, we\nsummarize the observed relative intensities of the four\ntransitions and compare the experimental conversion co-\nefficients for the 128 and 138 keV transitions with the\ntheoretical ones for E1, M1, and E2 multipolarity. From\nthis comparison, we conclude that E2 character is the most\nprobable assignment for the two low-energy transitions.\nIn the N \u0002 50 isotope 98Cd50 [13], the transition ener-\ngies in the E2 cascade from the maximally aligned 8\u0001\nisomeric state to the antialigned 0\u0001 ground state are 147,\n198, 688, and 1395 keV. We therefore assign the 1325 keV\ntransition as the ground state transition and the 539 keV\nline as the 4\u0001 ! 2\u0001 transition. The 128 and 138 keV\n\u0001 rays form the 8\u0001 ! 6\u0001 ! 4\u0001 sequence. Their order\ncannot be firmly established because their energies are so\nsimilar. The time distributions of the four transitions have\nbeen fitted separately with a single exponential decay. The\nresulting half-life values agree within their statistical un-\ncertainties (see Table I). Assuming pure \u0002\u0004g9=2\u0005\u00062 con-\nfigurations for the 2\u0001 to 8\u0001 states, the 6\u0001 state is expected\nto be an isomer with a nanosecond half-life, too.\nUnfortunately, the low statistics of the observed time dis-\ntributions do not allow an independent determination of\nT1=2\u00046\u0001\u0005. We therefore deduced a single decay time of\nT1=2 \u0002 220\u000430\u0005 ns by performing a least-squares fit to\nthe summed time spectra of all four transitions shown in\nthe inset in Fig. 2. In 98Cd, a 12\u0001 isomeric state has been\nobserved feeding the 8\u0001 isomer [18]. We cannot exclude\nthe existence of such a second, higher-lying isomer in\n130Cd.\nOur experimental results are not consistent with the\nprevious tentative assignment [11] of a 2\u0001 state at\n957 keV in 130Cd. In Fig. 3, the new level scheme for\n130Cd is compared to two different nuclear shell-model\n(SM) calculations based on a 88Sr50 core and G-matrix\nrealistic interactions derived for different model spaces\nfrom a CD-Bonn nucleon-nucleon potential [19] following\nthe method outlined in Ref. [20]. The first, called SM-I in\nthe following, uses a model space p1=2, s, d, g for protons\nand g7=2, s, d, h11=2 for neutrons. This implies that excita-\ntions across the closed Z \u0002 50 proton shell are included,\nwhereas neutron excitations across the N \u0002 82 shell clo-\nsure are not. The effective interaction was monopole tuned\nto experimental data between N \u0002 50 and 82 to reproduce\nsingle-particle and hole energies in 132Sn [21]. It was first\nsuccessfully applied to the study of the effects of 100Sn core\nexcitations in the A \u0002 102\u2013130 tin isotopes [22] and to \u0004\ndecay half-life predictions for N \u0002 82 isotones [23].\nFurther details on the single-particle energies and effective\noperators used are given in Refs. [22\u201324]. The calculations\nwere performed with the code ANTOINE [25]. The second\nshell-model calculation, SM-II, uses a model space p1=2,\ng9=2 for protons and, as in SM-I, g7=2, s, d, h11=2 for\nneutrons. Therefore, proton core excitations across Z \u0002\n50 and neutron core excitations across N \u0002 82 are not\nconsidered in this approach. Starting from the G matrix\nfor this valence space, an effective interaction was derived\nby applying monopole corrections to describe the evolu-\ntion of experimental single-particle energies for 88Sr to\nproton hole and neutron particle energies in 100Sn as\nadopted from Refs. [9,26]. The interaction was found to\ndescribe both high-spin states and Gamow-Teller decay in\nthe 100Sn region very well [27]. For the 132Sn region, be-\nsides A\u00061=3 scaling, additional monopole corrections were\napplied to describe the single hole energies [9,26] in 132Sn\nwithout modifying the 100Sn results. For 130Cd, proton and\nneutron effective charges of 1.5 e and 0.5 e, respectively,\nwere used to calculate E2 transition strengths.

The calculated B\u0004E2\u0005 transition strength for\nthe 8\u0001 ! 6\u0001 transition, B\u0004E2\u0005SM-I \u0002 1:5 W:u: and\nB\u0004E2\u0005SM-II \u0002 1:2 W:u:, compare well with the experimen-\ntal values of 1.7(2) and 1.3(2) W.u., respectively, obtained\nassuming either the 128 or the 138 keV \u0001 ray to be the\n8\u0001 ! 6\u0001 transition. Note that these values are also in good\nagreement with the corresponding experimental value of\n1.3(4) W.u. in 98Cd [18]. Since both shell-model calcula-\ntions employing modern interactions describe the level\nsequence and the decay properties of the 8\u0001 isomeric state,\nwe conclude that our new experimental results on 130Cd\nprovide no evidence for a quenching of the N \u0002 82 shell\nclosure.\nWe close this Letter with a stunning observation. In an\nempirical shell-model approach [26], the I \u0002 2\u0001 \u0006 8\u0001\nlevels are pure \u0004g9=2\u0005\u00062 states, while the 0\u0001 ground state\nis mixed with the \u0004p1=2\u0005\u00062 configuration. Our new results\non 130Cd, in comparison with 98Cd and 76Ni48 [29], there-\nfore allow one for the first time to extract an empirical j2\ntwo-body interaction, namely, for g9=2 protons and neu-\ntrons, over a wide range of atomic mass A. Apparently, the\n2\u0001 \u0006 8\u0001 energy spread scales with A\u00061 (as indicated by\nsolid arrows in Fig. 4), which seems to be at variance with\nthe common assumption [25,30] of a scaling with the\nharmonic oscillator quantum @!0 \u0002 41A\u00061=3 (indicated\nby dashed arrows in Fig. 4). This result should not be\naffected by Coulomb effects as, for I \u0001 0, Coulomb shifts\nare essentially constant in this model space [31]. However,\nthis g\u000629=2 interpretation of the 2\u0001 \u0006 8\u0001 energy difference\ncould be altered when extended model spaces are consid-\nered. In the first approximation, the 2\u0001 \u0006 8\u0001 spreading can\nbe estimated by considering only the quadrupole part of the\neffective interaction for which a scaling law Eq\b\nm2=\u0004D \u0007 A1=3\u0005 has been derived that warrants shell struc-\nture and saturation [25]. Here m and D denote the number\nof particles at the Fermi level and the shell degeneracy. For\nboth T \u0002 1 excitations from the lower pf shell and across\nthe Z, N \u0002 50 magic shell closure to the sdg shell (proton\nexcitations in the case of Cd, neutron excitations in the case\nof Ni), for which m and D are identical for all three\nisotopes, the familiar A\u00061=3 scaling is preserved.\nHowever, for core excitations of the Z \u0002 28 (76Ni), N \u0002\n50 (98Cd) and 82 (130Cd) closed shells which involve\nstrong proton-neutron (T \u0002 0) interactions, an additional\ndownscaling occurs with increasing major shell and D\nleading to the observed deviation from the A\u00061=3 scaling.\nIn conclusion, the question of whether and how far\nbelow 132Sn an erosion of the N \u0002 82 shell closure occurs\nwill be answered only when lighter N \u0002 82 waiting-point\nnuclei become accessible for both mass measurements and\nspectroscopic investigations at future radioactive beam\nfacilities. The new results on the level scheme of 130Cd,\nhowever, give no evidence for N \u0002 82 shell quenching in\nthis nucleus.\nA.
