By focusing on both the learner and teacher\nperspectives, the model encompasses a broad range of factors, including learner characteristics,\nlearning and teaching environments, interactions and activities. The proposed model provides a\nstarting point for the identification of challenges to learning from a socio-cultural perspective rather\nthan a medical or rehabilitation perspective. This holistic perspective is key to moving \u2018thinking\u2019\ntowards a more inclusive learning approach that embraces the needs of all learners, regardless of a\ndefined disability.\nIntroduction\nBlended learning has been described as learning \u2018that is facilitated by the effective\ncombination of different modes of delivery, models of teaching and styles of learning,\nand founded on transparent communication amongst all parties involved with a\ncourse\u2019.1 However, to ensure inclusive and accessible learning experiences that meet\nany challenges to the acquisition of knowledge, development of skills and experience,\nit is also important to take into account the full spectrum of learner characteristics.\nThese include physical, sensory and perceptual skills, abilities, attitudes and prior\nknowledge.\nThe use of blended learning techniques takes advantage of the variety of learning\nexperiences that can be offered by the use of a mix of learning environments (Reid-\nYoung, 2003); for example, lectures, workshops, self-paced study, online collabora-\ntion and communication exercises, simulations and the use of interactive multimedia.\nIn order to identify challenges to learning, it is important to investigate the compo-\nnents that form the learning experience and work towards the identification of issues\n*Corresponding author.

Rainger\nthat might be causing a mismatch between the interactions used to facilitate learning\nand the individual characteristics and\/or needs of the student.\nDespite the complexity of many learning experiences, which commonly involve\ninteractions with peers and support workers, it is felt that there are at least two\nperspectives within most learning situations that can be analysed to identify any chal-\nlenges or barriers to learning: that of the learner and that of the teacher (educator,\nlecturer, tutor, etc.). We will present a model for identifying the challenges to blended\nlearning that focuses on these two perspectives: the learner perspective and the\nteacher perspective.\nThe learner perspective\nIn focusing on the learner perspective learner skills (Figure 1), learner preference,\ncontent interaction and design, learning interactions and assistive technologies will be\ndiscussed.\nFigure 1.

These challenges can occur if the particu-\nlar physical, sensory and perceptual skills of a student have not been taken into\naccount when selecting the learning and teaching environment, interactions and\nactivities. Learner skills may be described (but not limited to) using the following\ncategories: \n\u25cf Motor skills. These include the ability to control gross motor and fine motor move-\nments along with dexterity\u2014the coordination to make use of gross and fine motor\nskills; the ability to voluntarily control the body movements accurately in a situation\nwhere there are no physical difficulties; body awareness and spatial orientation;\nspeed and accuracy of reaction to a physical stimulus.\n\u25cf Visual skills. Physical and visual-motor skills include appropriate eye movements,\nreception of image brightness, colour, tone, texture, shape, motion, and visual acuity\nwith issues of focus and possibly range of vision. Perception of spatial relationships\nis also important with visual closure, object recognition, whole\/part relationships,\nvisual (figure-ground) discrimination, depth perception and visual memory.\n\u25cf Auditory skills. These skills are the sensory or physical aspects of the reception of\nsound within normal ranges of volume and frequency along with perceptual\naspects of auditory processing. They may include phonological awareness,\nauditory memory, auditory sequencing, auditory blending and auditory (figure-\nground) discrimination as well as discrimination of internal sounds.\n\u25cf Language skills. These include skills of communication through written, spoken or\nkinaesthetic language, aspects of vocabulary range, expression, reception and\ncomprehension skills, ability to interpret accurately semantic and syntactic\nambiguities in language.\n\u25cf Learning skills. Briefly, these skills may incorporate the ability to gain knowledge\nand understanding of both concrete and conceptual-abstract ideas, skills of reason-\ning, evaluation and problem-solving. Other learning skills include metacognition,\nself-advocacy and the re-application of concepts in differing contexts. Also, there\nis the ability to process information, including sequential processing, simultaneous\nprocessing and management of the flow and speed of information. There is also the\nability to remember (short term and long term) or recall information even if the\ninformation is presented without a meaningful context and to hold it in the work-\ning memory alongside many other ideas.\nAll these skills affect or are affected by the student\u2019s resilience and coping strategies\nwithin a given environment and by the learner\u2019s preference for the use of individual\nskills. There may also be elements of anxiety, fatigue and pain, which impact on all\naspects of learning, in addition to time management and organisational abilities.\ne-Skills\nA learner\u2019s proficiency for using Information Communication Technology (ICT) is\nas important as their attitudes, motivation and understanding of \u2018e-skills\u2019 or\nInformation Learning Technology skills in any blended learning situation. The authors\n58 E. A. Draffan and P. Rainger\nconsider e-skills to be specifically related to the way students acquire and construct\nknowledge online while using the technologies available. There are certain issues that\nimpact on e-skills, such as a lack of access to the appropriate technologies, awareness\nand expertise in the use of e-learning specific study strategies, technically inaccessible\ncommunication or collaboration services and materials that do not suit personal learn-\ning preferences. It should be noted that there may be times when the student\u2019s skills,\nincluding proficiency and competence in the use of assistive technologies, impact on\nthe accessible nature of any learning technology used. For instance, an online discus-\nsion forum may be screen-reader friendly or accessible, but the learner may not have\nhad the chance to acquire the skills to use the screen reader with this type of interaction\nin the past. It is felt that some assistive technologies are so complex that they add to\nthe issues of anxiety and fatigue, and so on, thus affecting a student\u2019s wider abilities.\nLearner preferences\nKonradt et al. (2003, p. 310) mentioned the work of Rasmussen and Davidson-Shivers\n(1998) when they stated that \u2018there is also evidence that learning style dimensions can\nbe important factors in how a given student learns more effectively\u2019 and in an ideal\nworld there needs to be the appropriate selection and choice of a mix of delivery meth-\nods and representations of content to meet the online learners\u2019 needs. Most students\nhave chosen methods of interacting with course materials and these preferences impact\non their ability to work within an e-learning environment as much as their ability to\nuse the technology. Gavin Reid (2001, p. 195), in his article about dyslexia, metacog-\nnition and learning styles, highlights the fact that there are more than 100 instruments\ndesigned to identify individual learning styles that do some or all of the following: \n\u25cf Evaluate narrow aspects of learning such as preference for visual, auditory, tactual\nor kinaesthetic input.\n\u25cf Focus on factors primarily associated with personality issues such as intuition,\nactive experimentation and reflection.\n\u25cf Attempt to identify how individuals process information in terms of its input,\nmemory and expressive functions.\nThese instruments, however, do not always highlight the reasons why a student\nmay have issues with various types of hypermedia and navigational elements in an\ne-learning situation or how they interact with the computer interface. One has to\nmove out of the learning style arena and into the \u2018Human Computer Interface\u2019 world\nof psychology, design and information science to learn about these issues. Although\nthere are clear cross-over points when it comes to some skills, interface design has\ntended to be based on the information-processing model of cognition, which estab-\nlishes that (Marchionini, 1991): \n\u25cf humans have a working memory limited to five to seven \u2018chunks\u2019 of information;\n\u25cf humans must have their attention refreshed frequently; and\n\u25cf recalling information requires more cognitive effort than recognising information.\nIdentification of challenges to blended learning 59\nRegarding the cognitive effort required to recall or recognise information, it is\nmuch easier to use a drop-down menu that offers options rather than type in a\ncommand line without a prompt to effect an action on the computer. Touch panels\nmay be easier to use when compared with a mouse that requires manipulation when\naccessing button-type options. It has been argued, therefore, that \u2018the design of\nartefacts should naturally invite task appropriate usage, where buttons have obvious\nuses and follow common protocols and menus are clearly marked\u2019 (Hammond, 1993,\nch. 4). This also includes help files that can be designed to offer just-in-time support\nand contain small amounts of information rather than large chunks of inappropriate\nsupport that are not related to the problem encountered.\nContent interactions and design\nDiscussions related to learning styles may offer concepts about how a student prefers\nto study while the human computer interface theories offer support for how the user\ninteracts with the technologies. These discussions ignore, however, the issues related\nto the amount of content with possible information overload, lack of direction and,\nfor some, a sense of unease about the requirements of e-learning compared with face-\nto-face contact.\nResearchers talk about \u2018Field Dependence\u2019 and \u2018Field Independence\u2019 (Witkin\net al., 1977), where those who are Field Independent tend to perform better in an\nexploratory situation such as that found online, and are able to restructure the knowl-\nedge they gain in a more satisfactory manner. Field Dependent learners, however,\nmay be less able to cope with the unstructured nature of hypermedia and prefer a\nlinear approach where there is an organised flow of work (Ford et al., 1994). This is\nthe most efficient way of presenting information to a screen-reader user, so that they\nwork through material in a linear structured sequence. This is not necessarily the\nchoice that would have been preferred by the learner, who may like to have the\nadditional depth and breadth of learning offered by hypermedia. Where choice is\npossible it should be encouraged, and Chen (2002) suggests that with direct guidance\nin the form of notes as to which might be the next best page to visit, the hiding of links\nto irrelevant pages and annotated links with icons and\/or notes, Field Dependent\nstudents become less overwhelmed.\nOther learners include those \u2018who actively try to understand meaning by working\nout relationships between concepts, relating new material to previously known infor-\nmation\u2019 (Boyle et al., 2003, p. 269). Some people are surface learners who focus on\nmemory strategies to retain knowledge and only use what they immediately see to\ninform them in a particular situation. These strategies would indicate that it is not just\nthe quality of the presentation of the materials that is important, but also the quantity\nand their layout. Researchers also talk about \u2018self-directed learners\u2019 (Candy, 1991)\nwho like being in charge of their learning experience, and in many cases these\nstudents have often achieved success more easily (Boyle et al., 2003).\nWe define \u2018learner preferences\u2019 as the student\u2019s preferred approach to a particu-\nlar learning interaction within the context of the learning environment. As already\n60 E. A. Draffan and P. Rainger\nillustrated, these preferences can include study strategies, knowledge management\ntechniques and skills in the use of technologies, which have been developed\nthrough experience in response to learning skills, abilities and styles.\nLearning interactions and assistive technologies\nIf e-skills are lacking, the student may feel overwhelmed by the amount of informa-\ntion; if ICT skills are inadequate, interaction with the content may be limited; and if\nbasic usability issues have not been addressed, equal access will be compromised. It\nis therefore important to identify the different types of interactive components imbed-\nded within online learning materials and not just the relationship with the content,\nreadability, navigation and general environment that surrounds the learning object or\nmodule. As has been said, it is beneficial to ascertain the skills required to access these\ninterfaces as well as to accept different learning preferences and abilities so that\nstudents can be offered an interface to suit their needs, not one that causes confusion\nor concern. It may help to see the online environment as a collage with frames and\ninteractive components, not just in the form of menus and buttons, but also activities\nwithin the learning object.\nAn example of an activity or \u2018interactive component\u2019 may be a \u2018drag and drop\u2019\nroutine in an online assessment situation where words are moved from one part of the\nscreen to another using the mouse. This would be hard to achieve if the student had\nliteracy difficulties and\/or any visual or dexterity problems, or even a lack of knowl-\nedge about how to \u2018grab\u2019 the word and hold down the mouse button before moving\nit to the correct location.\nFurther interactions may be necessary with the introduction of additional assistive\ntechnologies (also often known as access, enabling or adaptive technologies). Most\nassistive technologies are categorised by disabilities and not by user skills, abilities or\nlinks to learning preferences. The authors feel that these categorisations usually fail\nto contain guides to the expertise required for the use of the technology. Such guides\nprobably do not exist at the moment, because they tend to be based on personal\nopinions, and are similar in style to reviews produced by \u2018Which\u2019 magazine. It is also\nfelt that in an educational setting there is rarely sufficient information as to how the\ntechnologies fit with the interaction types that make up a learning experience. This\ncan lead to missed opportunities for matching learners\u2019 needs to technologies. For\nexample, screen readers with speech synthesisers tend to appear under category head-\nings: \u2018vision\u2019, \u2018blind\u2019 or \u2018visual impairment\u2019. In other words, they are understood as\ntechnologies for people with visual needs. However, screen readers with speech\nsynthesisers may have a role to play in helping learners with information-processing\nneeds to read dense print on a webpage. Another example is spell-checkers, which\ntend to be categorised as tools for people with dyslexia or specific learning difficulties.\nHowever, spell-checkers are rarely analysed for their ability to correct \u2018dyslexic-type\u2019\nerrors.\nIt is essential to undertake an evaluation of how additional assistive technologies\nmight interact with the learning environments and their components to ensure\nIdentification of challenges to blended learning 61\naccessibility. It is felt that there are times when the complexities of the combined\ntechnologies could hamper the learning process. Assistive technologies have a learn-\ning curve and it is essential to ensure adequate training time is provided and that the\ntraining is provided in the context of the students\u2019 own learning and course require-\nments. For instance, providing magnification users with training alongside the use of\nthe learning materials could help them learn to appreciate where the main naviga-\ntional elements are to be found and how to use important keyboard shortcuts, which\nmay prove more effective than the use of a mouse in these circumstances.\nA pragmatic approach is required as it may have to be accepted that, despite the\nadvances in ICT and human interaction; adjustments will be necessary. Salomon\nstates that the effectiveness of a medium depends upon its match with the learner, the\ncontext, and the task: \nLearning can be facilitated to the extent that the activated skills are relevant to the\ndemands of the learning task [\u2026] For effective instructional communication, a match\nneeds to be established between the cognitive demands of a learning task, the skills that\nare required by the codes of the message, and the learner\u2019s level of mastery of these skills.\n(Salomon, 1977, p. 112 [reprint edition, 1994])\nPractical applications for the learner perspective section of the model\nThe concept of learner characteristics provides a holistic overview of the learner and\ngoes further than educationally based descriptions of a student that take a particular\nfocus or slant. For instance, Personal Development Plans or Individual Education\nPlans may contain information about a learner\u2019s accessibility needs as well as ICT\nskills, self-management, communication, e-skills, and so on. In higher education the\ndevelopment of \u2018ePortfolio\u2019 systems also provide an opportunity to include a broader\ndescription of a learner\u2019s characteristics that could offer invaluable information for a\ntutor or teacher. The IMS Access-for-All metadata specification (IMS Global\nLearning Consortium, 2003), in particular the Accessibility Learner Information\nProfile (ACCLIP), offers the technical base on which to develop such a system. Our\nproposed model can be used to help identify potential challenges, which along with\npossible adjustments, can be recorded in a student\u2019s \u2018ePortfolio\u2019 or electronic profile.\nThe teaching perspective\nOn designing any course, the learning objectives need to be explicitly identified,\nwhether these are the simple transference of knowledge or less tangible concepts such\nas the synthesis and understanding of the subject matter, the ability to demonstrate\nskills or building experience. Implicit learning requirements and objectives should\nalso be identified, such as prerequisite knowledge or the development of study skills\n(e.g. formal academic writing competency). \nIf students are to learn desired outcomes in a reasonably effective manner, then the\nteacher\u2019s fundamental task is to get students to engage in learning activities that are likely\nto result in their achieving those outcomes \u2026 It is helpful to remember that what the\n62 E. A. Draffan and P. Rainger\nstudent does is actually more important in determining what is learned than what the\nteacher does. (Shuell, 1986, p. 429)\nThe set of learning objectives should then inform course developers as to the most\nappropriate learning design. The learning design offers a range of learning or teaching\nactivities that could be used to facilitate the student meeting the learning objective.\nThe issue of context\nAny model that is developed to illustrate a teacher\u2019s perspective needs to be viewed\nfrom different levels of context and the different challenges to learning. Their\nrelationships depend on the level at which the teacher is working. For example, at the\ncourse preparation stage it is necessary to consider learner skills, which at present\noften include a student\u2019s impairments but not necessarily their abilities or coping\nstrategies. It is also important to consider elements or interactions that would affect\nlearning objectives such as distinguishing colours when a blind student is taking part\nin an exercise. Quality assurance, educational standards and professional or voca-\ntional requirements also need to be taken into account.\nWhen reviewing the course at the learning activity level, specific accessibility impli-\ncations of each learning and teaching activity (e.g. oral presentations and verbal\ninstructions), educational considerations and the availability of resources or staff\nskills need to be taken into account. Use cases are a helpful way to capture the\nfunctional requirements of particular students such as those who have hearing\ndifficulties and would benefit from use of a loop system. Strategies for the adaptation\nof courses, or activities, can be identified in anticipation of a student\u2019s enrolment.\nAt the delivery level, a teacher would be considering a learner\u2019s characteristics,\naccessibility needs, assistive technology and learning support needs. At this level it is\nalso possible to more accurately evaluate the impact of the adjustments required to\nsuit a learner\u2019s preferences in light of the accessibility issues.\nLearning design\nCourse requirements can be placed outside the environmental context box at this\nstage, as it is important to decide upon the use of a particular learning environment\nwith its related interactions and activities in order to fulfil the needs of a learning\nobjective rather than making the learning objective somehow fit into pre-defined envi-\nronment with a set of rigid exercises. As can be seen from Table 1, challenges to learn-\ning become apparent as the environment is analysed. By identifying possible issues\nposed by the components, a mismatch of educational provision and the learner\u2019s\nneeds can be avoided.\nOther components may include written instructions, note-taking, assignments, logs\nand reports, collaborative group work, presentations, research and reflection, online\nlearning, ICT, field study and assessments. It is the assessments and timed examina-\ntions that tend to pose particular concerns in some learning and teaching situations.\nLearners are required to demonstrate their understanding of the subject matter and\nIdentification of challenges to blended learning 63\nT\nab\nle\n 1\n.\nS\nam\npl\ne \nco\nm\npo\nne\nnt\ns \nan\nd \nth\ne \nis\nsu\nes\n in\nvo\nlv\ned\n in\n e\nns\nur\nin\ng \nac\nce\nss\n f\nor\n a\nll \nto\n v\ner\nba\nl i\nns\ntr\nuc\nti\non\ns \nor\n o\nra\nl p\nre\nse\nnt\nat\nio\nns\nC\nom\npo\nne\nnt\nIs\nsu\nes\nS\nup\npo\nrt\n s\ntr\nat\neg\nie\ns\nS\nup\npo\nrt\n t\nec\nhn\nol\nog\nie\ns\nT\nec\nhn\nol\nog\ny \nex\nam\npl\nes\nO\nra\nl p\nre\nse\nnt\nat\nio\nns\n a\nnd\n \nve\nrb\nal\n in\nst\nru\nct\nio\nns\n t\no \nth\ne \nst\nud\nen\nt\nA\nud\nit\nor\ny\nH\num\nan\n s\nup\npo\nrt\n\u2014\nco\nm\nm\nun\nic\nat\nio\nn \nsu\npp\nor\nt \nan\nd\/\nor\n \nin\nte\nrp\nre\nta\nti\non\nP\ner\nso\nna\nl l\noo\np \nsy\nst\nem\ns\/\npo\nrt\nab\nle\n r\nad\nio\n a\nid\n\/p\nor\nta\nbl\ne \nam\npl\nif\nie\nr\nF\nM\n t\nra\nns\nm\nit\nte\nr,\n r\nad\nio\n \nm\nic\nro\nph\non\ne \nki\nt\nU\nnd\ner\nst\nan\ndi\nng\n o\nf \nsu\npp\nor\nt \nre\nqu\nir\nem\nen\nts\n f\nor\n B\nri\nti\nsh\n S\nig\nn \nL\nan\ngu\nag\ne \nan\nd \nlip\n-r\nea\ndi\nng\n, e\ntc\n.\nU\nsi\nng\n a\n P\n.A\n. s\nys\nte\nm\ns \nau\ndi\no-\nou\nt \nso\nck\net\n o\nr \nus\nin\ng \na \nm\nic\nro\nph\non\ne \npl\nac\ned\n in\n c\nlo\nse\n \npr\nox\nim\nit\ny \nto\n a\n s\npe\nak\ner\nV\nid\neo\n o\nr \nau\ndi\no \nre\nco\nrd\ner\n in\n \nor\nde\nr \nto\n b\ne \nab\nle\n to\n r\nec\nor\nd \nan\nd \nch\nec\nk \nth\ne \nin\nst\nru\nct\nio\nns\nR\nad\nio\n a\nid\n, n\nec\nk \nlo\nop\n a\nnd\n \ndi\nre\nct\nio\nna\nl m\nic\nro\nph\non\ne\nL\nan\ngu\nag\ne\/\nco\nm\npr\neh\nen\nsi\non\nA\nlt\ner\nna\nti\nve\n f\nor\nm\nat\ns\u2014\nfo\nr \nve\nrb\nal\n \nin\nfo\nrm\nat\nio\nn;\n e\n.g\n. e\nas\ny-\nto\n-r\nea\nd \npa\npe\nr-\nba\nse\nd \nin\nst\nru\nct\nio\nns\n if\n \nap\npr\nop\nri\nat\ne \nin\n c\nle\nar\n E\nng\nlis\nh \nan\nd \nap\npr\nop\nri\nat\nel\ny \nse\nqu\nen\nce\nd,\n \npe\nrh\nap\ns \nnu\nm\nbe\nre\nd \nor\n b\nul\nle\nte\nd\nS\nm\nar\nt k\ney\nbo\nar\nd \nor\n e\nle\nct\nro\nni\nc \nm\nem\no \nde\nvi\nce\nM\nin\ni d\nis\nc \nor\n d\nig\nit\nal\n \nre\nco\nrd\ner\n w\nit\nh \nex\nte\nrn\nal\n \nm\nic\nro\nph\non\ne \nan\nd \nad\ndi\nti\non\nal\n t\nap\nes\nS\ntu\nde\nnt\n t\nra\nin\nin\ng\u2014\nto\n e\nnc\nou\nra\nge\n \ngo\nod\n li\nst\nen\nin\ng \nsk\nill\ns\nA\nlp\nha\nS\nm\nar\nt \nD\nan\na,\n \nA\nlp\nha\nS\nm\nar\nt \n30\n00\nE\nle\nct\nro\nni\nc \nve\nrs\nio\nns\n if\n a\npp\nro\npr\nia\nte\n \npr\nef\ner\nab\nly\n w\nit\nh \ngr\nap\nhi\ncs\n; e\n.g\n. a\ns \nab\nov\ne\nC\nom\npu\nte\nr \nto\n a\ncc\nes\ns \nth\ne \nm\nat\ner\nia\nls\nP\nC\n, A\npp\nle\n M\nac\n, L\nin\nux\n \npl\nus\n in\nte\nrn\net\n c\non\nne\nct\nio\nn \nor\n L\nA\nN\nM\nem\nor\ny\/\nre\nca\nll\nE\nnc\nou\nra\nge\n s\ntu\nde\nnt\n t\no \nre\nco\nrd\n \nin\nst\nru\nct\nio\nns\nA\nud\nio\n r\nec\nor\nde\nr \nor\n n\not\ne \nin\n \nha\nnd\nhe\nld\n e\nle\nct\nro\nni\nc \nm\nem\no \nor\n \nP\nD\nA\n, B\nra\nill\ne \nno\nte\n-t\nak\ner\n if\n \nap\npr\nop\nri\nat\ne\nD\nig\nit\nal\n r\nec\nor\nde\nr.\n P\nD\nA\n\/\nel\nec\ntr\non\nic\n n\not\ne-\nta\nke\nr\n64 E.

In some cases this might be\ntraced right back to the course requirements, and questions may need to be raised as\nto the validity of any specific requirement that poses accessibility issues for disabled\nstudents.\nFigure 2.

The two perspectives (that of the learner and that of the teacher) offered\ncannot cover all the issues related to the interactions that occur in a blended learning\nsituation, but it is hoped that they highlight some features that should be evaluated.\nIt is felt that it is particularly important to acknowledge the concerns that arise with\nthe use and proficiency of technologies in relation to learning activities, whether their\nuse is explicit such as with \u2018learning technologies\u2019 (e.g. online discussion boards),\nassumed (e.g. MS Office Skills) or implicit such as the use of assistive technologies.\nFigure 3. A model for the identification of challenges to blended learning. Note: Dotted line represents a possible challenge to learning and a path of interaction that occur.Challenges to learning can be met and overcome using a variety of approaches, but\nthe challenges posed by a learning interaction can rarely be overcome by adjustments\nmade on one side of the model alone. Meeting the needs of a learner\u2019s skill, abilities\nand preferences in order to facilitate a particular learning interaction requires the\ncooperation and involvement of both the educational faculty (represented by the\nteacher perspective) and of the student (represented by the learner perspective), along\nwith any staff involved in their support; for example, learning support tutors (suggest-\ning new study strategies) or assistive technologists (working on technological\nsupport).\nIt is also important to recognise that learning interactions are represented in the\nmodel by a plane and not by a line. The representation is used to emphasise the fact\nLearner \nCharacteristics\nLearning\n Interaction\nLearning Experience\nLearning & Teaching \nObjectives\nFigure 3. A model for the identification of challenges to blended learning. Note: Dotted line rep-\nresents a possible challenge to learning and a path of interaction that occur.\n66 E. A. Draffan and P. Rainger\nthat learning interactions fall into a continuum and they are affected by many other\nfactors. It clarifies the fact that when adjustments are made to a learning situation,\nthere are many possible ways to approach the interaction but rarely is the pathway a\ndirect one.\nIn our model, the role of the teacher (which might be played by a variety of staff\nfrom different departments) is to facilitate learning, through the facilitation of\nlearning interactions. This is somewhat different from other models, such as the\nconversation model of Laurillard (2001), which deal primarily with the interactions\nbetween a single student and teacher. These interactions may actually be facilitated\nthrough the use of assistive technologies, involvement of a learner\u2019s peers, the assis-\ntance of learning support staff, the use of adapted learning materials or participation\nin an alternative but equally viable learning activity. Therefore, the teacher\u2019s perspec-\ntive of the model is equally applicable at an institutional level and can be applied from\na student support as well as an academic perspective.\nThe approach taken to accessibility, within a blended learning environment, is\nbased on taking the focus away from disability and towards factors influencing the\nlearners\u2019 interactions, which is similar to the methodology pioneered by Vygostsky in\nhis approach to early years education: \nAny physical handicap \u2026 not only alters the child\u2019s relationship with the world, but\nabove all affects his interaction with people. Any organic defect is revealed as a social\nabnormality in behaviour. It goes without question that blindness and deafness per se are\nbiological factors. However, the teacher must deal not so much with these biological\nfactors by themselves, but rather with their social consequences. When we have before us\na blind boy as the object of education, then it is necessary to deal not so much with\nblindness by itself, as with those conflicts which arise for a blind child upon entering life.\n(Vygotsky, 1983, p. 102)\nTherefore, in order to facilitate inclusive learning, we need to ensure students can\ninteract successfully with the technologies, themselves (through reflection), peers,\nteachers, support workers and learning materials. This means that the key issue in\nguaranteeing inclusive learning is the identification of any challenges to learning\nposed by the learning interactions.\nA Vygostskian approach is common in the delivery of student support within all\nsectors of education but has only started to make headway in the delivery of higher\neducation by faculty. The proposed model provides a starting point for the identifi-\ncation of challenges to learning from a socio-cultural perspective rather than a medi-\ncal or rehabilitation perspective. This holistic perspective is key to moving \u2018thinking\u2019\ntowards a more inclusive learning approach that embraces the needs of all learners\nsuch as those for whom English is a Second or Other Language regardless of a defined\ndisability.\nNotes\n1.
