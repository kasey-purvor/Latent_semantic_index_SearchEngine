INTRODUCTION\nDESPITE significant advances, the major challenge indiagnostic X-ray imaging remains the determination of\nsmall size lesions in a low-contrast environment, while keeping\nthe dose applied as low as possible. The screening situation in\nthe diagnosis of breast cancer has not changed appreciably, and\nX-ray mammography remains the gold standard for screening,\nalthough its specificity is 15%\u201320% [1]. In conventional\nX-ray diagnostic imaging, the spatial distribution of the energy\nof the transmitted photons within the object is exploited to form\nthe image of interest. Each spatial image coordinate carries\ninformation about the linear attenuation coefficient and the\nelectron density. The subject of this research is to develop\nan alternative approach that allows the spatial distribution of\nX-ray scattering properties, characterized by the differential\nscatter cross section to be mapped throughout the\ninterior of the tissues concerned. The presence of diffraction\nmaxima in the measured scattering profiles can thus be used to\nManuscript received November 15, 2003. This work was supported by the\nWellcome Trust by Grant 062123.\nD.

In medical X-ray imaging the\ncoherent X-ray scatter peaks at precisely those energies where\nX-ray breast imaging is performed [2], [3]. The low-angle\nbehavior of coherent scatter is highly dependent on the\nchemical and structural properties of the scatterer. Its intensity,\nas a function of angle, is related to the molecular structure of the\nobject being irradiated. Every molecular structure has its own\nsignature scattering pattern. The origin of the peaks in the pat-\nterns is the interference of photons scattered from the molecules\nof the medium. The degree of interference is dependent on the\nmomentum transfer given by , where\nis the scattering angle and the wavelength of the X-rays.\nThese interferences produce one or more peaks in intensity\nclose to the forward direction and the complete distribution is\nconsidered as characteristic of the investigated sample. Each\nscattering profile represents the variation in differential scatter\ncross section as a function of the momentum transfer, which is\ndetermined by the incident energy and the angle of detection.\nMany biological tissues have significant spatial ordering and\nreadily diffract X-rays. X-ray diffraction measurements on bi-\nological materials [4]\u2013[10] showed that the molecular structure\nof diseased tissues undergoes significant changes, and hence,\nthe structure can be understood as a fingerprint of the disease.\nIn particular, the X-ray coherent scatter cross sections of breast\ntissues are shown to be quite distinctive and different, in a mate-\nrial-specific way, for specific scattering angles and photon ener-\ngies. The ability of coherent X-ray scatter to provide the molec-\nular structure of breast tissues could add a new dimension in\nX-ray breast imaging capable of tracking the molecular struc-\ntural changes during disease progression and of improving the\nsensitivity to low-contrast lesions without increasing the radia-\ntion dose.\nThe differential coherent scattering cross section can be\nexpressed as:\n, where is the Thomson dif-\nferential cross section, the classical electron radius, is\nthe scattering angle , and is the molecular form\nfactor. At large values of , the molecular form factor approx-\nimates the independent atomic model (IAM) and is written as\n, where is the atomic abundance\nand the atomic form factor.

Experimental set-up showing the concept of simultaneous measurements of the transmitted primary and the forward scattered X-rays from a phantom.\nbution, which is a property of the material. For small values\nof it approaches Z, while for large values of tends toward\nzero. However, the IAM does not include intramolecular or\nintermolecular effects caused by the close spacing of molecules\nin real materials. For compounds or mixtures, the molecular\nform factor is given by: ,\nwhere and are the mass fraction and the atomic mass\nof the ith element and W the molecular weight. At low values\nof , the diffraction from amorphous materials, such as most\nbody tissues, is circularly symmetric around the primary\nbeam. The scattering profiles show one or more broad peaks\nwith an oscillatory behavior around the free-gas model, while\ntoward higher values of the amplitude of the oscillation\nstrongly decreases. As a final point, the differential cross\nsection for a compound or a mixture can be expressed in\nterms of a linear differential scattering coefficient given by:\n,\nwhere is the Avogadro number, M and are the molecular\nmass and the density of the material; the and the\nare the Thomson and Klein-Nishina differential\nphoton scattering cross sections, respectively; and is\nthe molecular incoherent scattering function, which can be\ncalculated from the sum rule: ,\nwhere is the IAM scattering function.\nThe important parameters in the design consideration and\noptimization of X-ray imaging systems to clearly identify\ntissues of interest from other tissues surrounding them, and\nhence, to enhance the image contrast, are: the incident photon\nenergy-scatter angle, the scatter intensity-tissue volume and\nthe diffraction sensitivity-spatial resolution. By carefully\nincorporating these design factors, work is under way to build\na laboratory prototype dual-sensor breast-imaging scanning\nsystem [11], which combines the diagnostic information\nfrom the conventional X-ray transmission with that from the\nlow-angle X-ray scattering. Fig. 1 shows the experimental\nset-up and the concept for simultaneous measurements of\nthe transmitted primary and the forward scattered X-rays\nusing the same high-resolution micro-focus X-ray source. For\nthe high-resolution X-ray transmission system a large-area\nHamamatsu CMOS (C7942) X-ray imager, with a pixel size of\n50 and a columnar structured CsI(Tl) scintillator directly\ndeposited on its active area for high spatial resolution, is\nemployed. Experiments carried out with the Contrast Detail\nMammography (CDMAM) phantom (type 3.2) were also\nshowed that the CMOS sensor has high low-contrast sensitivity\nand small-detail visibility. It was able to resolve a range\nof small objects with a diameter between 0.16 and 3.2 mm\ncorresponding to minimum detectable thickness of 1 to 0.06\n, respectively, at an entrance surface dose of 4 mGy\n(these results are presented in detail in another publication\nunder preparation). Most importantly, the CMOS sensor with\nits direct addressable pixel readout (random access) provides\nus with the capability of selective readout and, therefore, lends\nitself well for simultaneous measurements.\nThe requirements for the coherent scatter detector can be\nsummarized, as follows: 1) need of energy-resolved sensor ca-\npable of giving us position information; 2) ability of direct de-\ntection of X-rays; 3) need of low-noise since the coherent scatter\nsignal is weak comparatively to transmission signal; the scatter\nsignal is typically three\u2013four orders of magnitude lower than\nthe transmission one; therefore, need of discrimination between\nsignal and noise by setting up a threshold; 4) ability of opera-\ntion at or near room temperature and 5) need to determine the\noptimum angular range (i.e., range in )\nof detection of photons when trying to distinguish structures.\nTo address these requirements the coherent X-ray scatter detec-\ntion system required the design and development of a high-re-\nsistivity multielement two-dimensional (2-D) Si-pad array with\na multichannel low-noise pulse processing front-end electronics\nchip and a new DAQ system. Results regarding the characteriza-\ntion and optimization of the detector-readout electronics-DAQ\nsystem and its performance to measure diffraction signatures of\nmost commonly used breast-equivalent materials of interest are\npresented here.\nII. COHERENT X-RAY SCATTER DETECTION SYSTEM AND ITS\nELECTRONICS\nThe Si-pad detectors are sufficiently quantum efficient\n( 70% at 17 keV) and operate in spectroscopic pulse-counting\nmode. These detectors developed in collaboration with SINTEF,\nNorway were optimized to measure X-ray photons in the en-\nergy range of 12\u201345 keV, with a FWHM energy resolution of\nabout 1\u20133 keV. There are 3 detector modules. Each detector\nmodule consists of an array of 6 21 pad detectors aligned\non a 2-mm pitch with a 12 mm 42 mm of active area.

Each detector module consists of a dc-coupled\nsingle sided device fabricated from high-resistivity 1-mm-thick\nsilicon. A multiguard ring structure was incorporated around\nthe edge of each detector module to allow stable operation in\nfull depletion, corresponding to operation bias voltages, ,\nof 150\u2013300 V. Thin metal traces from each detector pad lead to\nbond pads located on one side of the detector suitable for direct\nwire bonding to a PCB motherboard containing the XA1.3, a\nhigh-density IDE AS (Norway) readout chip. There are two\nbond pads per channel, each pair of pads on 100 pitch. The\nbond pad dimensions are . Biased guard ring\nelectrodes surround each detector pad to minimize crosstalk.\nThe XA1.3 is a 128-channel pulse counting custom-tailored\nASIC. It is a low-noise low-power self-triggered and data-driven\ncharge signal acquisition chip, which upon a signal detection\nabove the adjustable threshold, responds with sending out the\nenergy- and position-information of the hit channel. A charge\npulse collected by any of the 128 channels is amplified and fil-\ntered by the preamplifier and the shaper in the channel. If the\namplitude of the peak analog signal is larger than the external\nadjustable threshold voltage , a trigger signal is generated\ninternally and the trigger plus the channel address are shown as\nanalog current outputs. Each detector module consists of an FR4\nsupport card with a high-density 26-pin flat cable connector to\nthe external DAQ circuit.\nThe DAQ system consists of a programmable gate array to\ncontrol the data acquired from three 12-bit A\/D converters,\nwhich are clocked continuously. When a strobe pulse oc-\ncurs, the relevant simultaneous samples from the converters\nare packed into a 5-byte data package and clocked into a\nFIFO. These packages are sent contiguously into the FIFO\nas and when strobes demand it, one package per strobe. The\nFIFO output transmits data to a PC data acquisition card, NI\n(National Instruments, U.K.) PCI 6534 buffered digital I\/O\ncard. The maximum data rate into the NI card is 20 Mb\/s, by\nACK\/REQ handshake. The timing and control block splits\ntime into integration periods, the duration of which is set by\nan external 8-bit port. Circuits to provide bias supplies and\ninterface signals from\/to the XA1.3 chips as required were\nalso developed. Menu-driven DAQ software runs the whole\ndetector-electronics system. All the configuration parameters\nare set through this software. The DAQ software operates either\nin a calibration or a normal mode. Before it can be used to\nacquire data (normal mode), the software needs to calibrate\nthe detector and the ADC channels (calibration mode) and\nto produce look-up tables. This involves acquiring data for\ndecoding the detector address from ADC channels B and C\nand the signal strength data from ADC channel A for five\ndifferent calibration signal strengths. Once the calibration\nhas been done, one can switch to normal mode, where data\nis acquired and automatically decoded. Gain shift correction\nand energy conversion in keV [according to:\n]\nare also implemented. As a final point, noisy and\/or \u201cdead\u201d\nchannels can be disabled from being able to trigger, so, they\nwill not contribute in the noise of the system. Special Lab-\nView-based programme was developed for the analysis and the\nFig. 2.

The data can be presented in a single-channel spectral\nresponse and\/or overall spectrum across all detector channels;\nhit map, mean amplitude, FWHM across all channels; 2-D\nintensity maps showing the pulse height for each channel; and\nfinally, peak centroid and energy resolution measurements\ncan be performed. Fig. 2 shows the internal layout of the\nmultielement Si-pad array.\nIII. CHARACTERISATION OF THE COHERENT X-RAY SCATTER\nDETECTION SYSTEM\nTo begin, a set of calibration measurements was performed to\noptimize the working condition of the detection system. These\ntests were carried out by sending voltage pulses to the detector\nchannels through the test input. Working in calibration mode,\na low-noise precision pulser was used to give an absolute cali-\nbration of the multicell Si-pad array with a reasonable accuracy.\nFive calibration voltages, for better data averaging, were imple-\nmented with a threshold voltage of . The bias\nvoltage applied to the detector via the 710 Quad Bias Supply\nNIM unit was , while the leakage current for\nthe detector module was given at any time by\nthe same NIM unit. A calibration graph of the calibration volt-\nages in mV versus the ADC centroid values was plotted and\na linear regression was applied as shown in Fig. 3. It is clear\nthat the front-end electronics chip provides good linearity to the\ndetection system. The capabilities of the system were success-\nfully tested for Vth as low as 0.07 mV and calibration voltage as\nlow as 0.5 mV. Once the detector was calibrated and the energy\nlook-up tables were generated, the normal mode was switched\non for the rest of the experiments.\nFurther, to determine the optimum working conditions with\nrespect to the operating voltage , threshold voltage ,\nleakage current , and temperature T, as well as to assess the\nnoise performance of the coherent scatter detection system as\nregards the operating conditions and the threshold set up for dis-\ncrimination between scatter signal and noise, experiments were\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Fig. 4 shows the noise behavior of the co-\nherent scatter detection system for different operating voltages,\nas given by the design specifications (as described in Section II),\nat , while Fig. 5 for different operating voltages\nand different threshold voltages.\nObviously, the number of noise events measured is low, in\ncomparison with the number of events when using the source,\nfor all the operating voltages given by the design specifications.\nBetween the different operating voltages, there was a very short\nperiod of time while the detector was reaching equilibrium; then\nthe noise events were increased up to the level of the corre-\nsponding detector bias value. It was decided for all future ex-\nperiments to operate the Si-pad detector at ,\nwhich allows stable operation in full depletion and low-noise.\nBy reducing the and\/or increasing the , the number of\nnoise events is increased. However, for and in\nthe range of interest (0.07\u20130.12 mV) the number of noise\nevents is extremely low. For example, less than 100 noise events\nacross the 126 detector channels for and\n. This specific range of allows clear distinction be-\ntween the signal and the noise, as well as the detection of X-rays\nwithin the energy range of interest.\nFig. 5.

(a) Noise performance of the coherent scatter detection system for\ndifferent temperatures. (b) Variation of temperature during the \u201clive\u201d time of\nthe experiment.\nSince the XA1.3 readout chip is susceptible to small changes\nin the operating temperature and requires operating at stable\ntemperature, a peltier cooling element was added at the exterior\nof the detector-electronics metal box, as well as a circuit was de-\nsigned and built to regulate and measure the temperature inside\nand outside the metal box. Fig. 6 shows the noise behavior of\nthe coherent scatter detection system for different temperatures,\nwhile Fig. 7 the distribution of noise events for different temper-\natures and leakage currents. Clearly, the number of noise events\nremains very low if the detection system operates at stable tem-\nperature, which is actually near the room temperature. For the\nrange of temperatures of interest, i.e., at or near the room tem-\nperature, the leakage current of the Si-pad detector does not in-\ncrease significantly, and hence, the number of noise events is\nvery low.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Distribution of noise events for different temperatures and different\nleakage currents.\nThe next step was to assess and optimize the energy response\nof the Si-pad based low-angle scatter system within the energy\nrange (12\u201345 keV) given in the design specifications and to de-\ntermine its energy resolution by employing a laboratory variable\nenergy X-ray source, Am-241, (358 MBq) to produce the X-rays\nof specific energies. This source consists of a compact assembly\ncontaining a sealed ceramic primary Am-241 source. It excites\ncharacteristic X-rays from six different targets mounted on a ro-\ntary holder. Each target can be presented to the primary source\nin turn and the characteristic X-rays from the target are emitted\nthrough a 4-mm diameter aperture. To cover the energy rage of\ninterest, we made use of the following targets: Mo (17.44 and\n19.63 keV with relative intensities of 100 and 15, respectively),\nAg (22.10 and 24.99 keV with relative intensities of 100 and 16,\nrespectively), Ba (32.06 and 36.55 keV with relative intensities\nof 100 and 18, respectively), and Tb (44.26 and 50.65 keV with\nrelative intensities of 100 and 20, respectively). The figures in\nparentheses correspond to and lines, respectively. The\nexperiments for the energy spectral response were performed at\n, and . The energy\nresponse of the Si-pad array across all 126 channels and for dif-\nferent energies is shown in Fig. 8 (where event denotes number\nof total counts across the 126 channels). The DAQ system was\ninitially designed in a way that the ADC scale is in the oppo-\nsite direction of energy, i.e., the corresponds to\n. The FWHM energy resolution measured for Mo\nand Tb is 3 keV for all channels and 1 keV for single channel.\nApparently, the multielement Si-pad detector can detect X-rays\nin the energy range of 17\u201345 keV and can resolve the and\npeaks of Tb, Ba, Ag, and Mo, which tie in with the known\nbranching ratios, as given above. The detection efficiency of the\nSi-pad detector varies between 65% at 20 keV to 17% at 45\nkeV.\nTo quantitatively assess the low-angle X-ray scatter perfor-\nmance of the special-purpose designed multielement Si-pad\narrays, the scattering profiles of water, some most commonly\nused breast-equivalent materials (PMMA, nylon, polyethylene)\nand breast adipose tissue (from mastectomy) were measured.\nA high-resolution micro-focus Mo source operating at 30 kVp\nwas used. An absorption filter of Zr was placed in front of the\nX-ray tube to monochromate the X-rays from the continuum\nto an almost 17.44 keV peak (the average energy of mammog-\nFig. 8. Spectral response of the multicell Si-pad array to different X-ray\nenergies of interest.\nraphy). An appropriate arrangement of slits was led to a highly\ncollimated beam incident on the samples, which were placed on\na rotating table in the centre of the scattering geometry to ensure\nthat different parts of the specimens were equally exposed to\nX-rays. Another set of collimators was placed in front of the\nSi-pad detectors to make sure that the well-resolved coherently\nscatter patterns at a fixed angle of 6 [12] were obtained. The\nthickness of each sample was chosen according to the inverse\nof attenuation coefficient to provide adequate number of\nsingle-scattering events while minimizing the probability of\nmultiple scattering; a polypropylene cylindrical container with\na wall thickness of 0.1 mm to minimize the effects of attenua-\ntion was employed as a sample holder. The measured scattering\nprofiles in terms of linear scattering coefficient per unit solid\nangle (as defined in Section I) for the aforementioned\nmaterials are shown in Fig. 9. As part of the experimental data\nanalysis, each measured scattering signature was subjected to\ncorrections for scatter and attenuation and normalized with the\ntheoretical data in the region of momentum transfer where\nno interference effects are expected.\nThe scattering profiles measured show one predominant peak,\nor several as in the case of polyethylene and nylon, where in-\nterference effects are most important and its position is charac-\nteristic of the material; then the intensity falls in an oscillatory\nway according to the free-gas model (IAM). These results are\nin excellent agreement with former published data [4], [6], [7],\nand [10] regarding the peak position ( value) and the shape\n(broad or sharp). The peak position for the materials used are:\nfor PMMA; for breast adi-\npose tissue; and for poly-\nethylene; and for nylon;\nand for water. However, there is a substan-\ntial difference in the relative magnitudes of the peaks, i.e., in the\nmain peak height, defined as the ratio of the value of the linear\ndifferential coefficient at the main peak position to the average\nof the values corresponding at the region of momentum transfer\nvalues which is independent of interference effects. The differ-\nence arises because surrounding irradiated background sources\n(e.g., sample synthesis, preparation and geometry, sample con-\ntainer, etc. ) contribute additional scatter to the measured\nX-ray coherent scatter signal.

Finally, the contribution of multiple scat-\ntering should be investigated. All these issues should be thor-\noughly examined and addressed before we proceed with the im-\nplementation of low-angle scatter imaging in the detection of\nbreast cancer, since the various breast tissues are bathed in fluids\nsuch as blood and any lesion is typically surrounded by benign\nand other type tissues that can produce scatter signals, which\nwill be difficult, if not impossible, to separate and localize inde-\npendently from the small signal produced by malignancy.\nIV. SUMMARY\nA coherent X-ray scatter detection system based on a\nhigh-resistivity multielement 2-D Si-pad array, a multichannel\nlow-noise pulse processing front-end electronics chip, the\nXA1.3, and a new DAQ system was designed and developed.\nIt was shown that this novel detection system meets the design\nspecifications combining good energy resolution (1\u20133 keV)\nwith position information; very good spectral response (17\u201345\nkeV) to the X-ray energies of interest; excellent low-angle\nX-ray scatter performance with highly resolved diffraction\nsignatures at mammographic energies; low-noise behavior;\nand operates at near room temperature without the need of\ncryogenic cooling. The multielement 2-D Si array in combina-\ntion with a suitable multiangle collimator provides us with the\ncapability of applying a mixture of angle and energy dispersion\ntechniques and has the potential to collect multiple scatter\nsignals simultaneously, either from the same voxel or from a\nlarge number of voxels, to maximize the content of diagnostic\ninformation at shorter measurement scanning times. It is,\ntherefore, demonstrated that this Si-pad based coherent scatter\ndetection system lends itself well to the detection of diffraction\nsignatures and its implementation to a dual-sensor X-ray breast\nimaging system that will combine transmission and coherent\nscattering procedures.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank D.
