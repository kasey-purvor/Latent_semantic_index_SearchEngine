Both, according to Mohr and O'Donnell (1996), based on a long defunct Australian soap The Restless Years, with Dutch scripts produced after the first two seasons and developed independently in both cultures. 12. Such as Laura, in Goede Tijden, who has an affair with Sten, her son's best friend. 13. In Goede Tijden it happened to Helen, everybody's surrogate mother whose lover Koen tried to kill her, and to Robert, who was pushed through a mirror by his wife Laura; in Underweg Naar Morgen Frank was pushed down the stairs by (as it turned out) his wife Daphne, in Gute Zeiten, Schlechte Zeiten the man who goes out with Saskia plans to murder her. 14. Two examples: Renco in Goede Tijden falls in love with Diane, who turns out to be his half sister, and so does Pim, in Onderweg Naar Morgen. 15. Such as Saskia of Gute Zeiten, Schlechte Zeiten falling in love with a man who was trying to murder her, or Tina (in the same soap) breaking off with her lover Tom because she falls in love with an extortionist kidnapper. 16. While no immigrants then lived on Coronation Street, two immigrant families lived on Lindenstrasse--the Pavaroties, who own an Italian restaurant, and the Sarikakis who own a Greek restaurant. 17. Seeing Olli, Lindenstrasse's neo-Nazi, as a basically decent, guy, who had suffered from lack of love as a child, and deserves a second chance, is shared by the viewer and by Lisa Hoffmeister, a young teenager -- blond, spiritual, orphaned. Lisa, the gentlest, kindest, most innocently beautiful Cinderella believes in Olli against the advice of older people, making him the hero of the one 'pure' love story of the soap. 18. The exception, which ended tragically, was Deirdre's marriage to Samia, a Moroccan who was under threat to be deported. Samia's kidney was found compatible with the kidney of Deirdre's daughter Tracy, who suffered the consequences of a drug addiction. After Samia donated this kidney he was the victim for a racial attack and died.  The story is beautifully pedagogic, as it demonstrates that  human blood is identical everywhere, and the spirit of generosity and self sacrifice as well as brutal hatred is  not the property of one's own community. 19. Samia, as recounted, was killed by hooligans. Gail's husband Brian is stabbed to death, Vicki's parents are killed in a car crash. 20. In addition to the violence of the two neo Nazis against foreigners, there are violent husbands--Olaf King who attempted to rape his wife (and caused her death), and Anna Ziegler's first husband who beat her up.","cites":null},{"id":17293765,"title":"Anatomy of Criticism.","authors":[],"date":"1957","doi":"10.2307\/40098206","raw":"Frye, N.
