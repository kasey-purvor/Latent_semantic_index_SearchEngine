Plasma copeptin was highest on admission (n=132, P<0.001, day 1 versus days 2 to 5) and reached a plateau at days 3 to 5. In the 980 patients, copeptin (measured at days 3 to 5) was elevated in patients who died (n=101) or were readmitted with heart failure (n=49) compared with survivors (median [range] 18.5 [0.6 to 441.0] versus 6.5 [0.3 to 267.0] pmol\/L, P<0.0005). With logistic regression analysis, copeptin (odds ratio, 4.14, P<0.0005) and NTproBNP (odds ratio, 2.26, P<0.003) were significant independent predictors of death or heart failure at 60 days. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves for copeptin (0.75) and NTproBNP (0.76) were similar. The logistic model with both markers yielded a larger area under the curve (0.84) than for NTproBNP (P<0.013) or copeptin (P<0.003) alone, respectively.
