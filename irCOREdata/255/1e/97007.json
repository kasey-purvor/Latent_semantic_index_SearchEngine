A succession of\ngenetic mutations or epigenetic changes can lead to homeostasis\nin the crypt being overcome, and subsequent unbounded growth.\nWe consider the dynamics of a single colorectal crypt by using a\ncompartmental approach [Tomlinson IPM, Bodmer WF (1995) Proc\nNatl Acad Sci USA 92:11130\u201311134], which accounts for popula-\ntions of stem cells, differentiated cells, and transit cells. That\noriginal model made the simplifying assumptions that each cell\npopulation divides synchronously, but we relax these assumptions\nby adopting an age-structured approach that models asynchro-\nnous cell division, and by using a continuum model. We discuss two\nmechanisms that could regulate the growth of cell numbers and\nmaintain the equilibrium that is normally observed in the crypt. The\nfirst will always maintain an equilibrium for all parameter values,\nwhereas the second can allow unbounded proliferation if the net\nper capita growth rates are large enough. Results show that an\nincrease in cell renewal, which is equivalent to a failure of pro-\ngrammed cell death or of differentiation, can lead to the growth of\ncancers. The second model can be used to explain the long lag\nphases in tumor growth, during which new, higher equilibria are\nreached, before unlimited growth in cell numbers ensues.\nage-structure \u0001 feedback \u0001 mutations \u0001 structural stability\nThe large intestine is one of the most frequent sites ofcarcinogenesis due, at least in part, to its continual self-\nrenewal and the large numbers of daily cell divisions (1). There\nare millions of invaginations in the lining of the colon, called\ncrypts, and it is widely believed that colorectal cancer is initiated\nwhen mutations or relatively stable epigenetic changes occur in\nthe single layer of epithelial cells that line the crypt. Conse-\nquently, much work has been directed toward understanding the\nmechanisms involved in the dynamics of the cells in healthy and\nneoplastic (abnormally growing) crypts.\nStem cells are believed to reside near the bottom of the\ncolorectal crypt (2), and these are capable of producing a variety\nof cell types that are required for tissue renewal and regeneration\nafter injury (3). The stem cells divide to produce transit cells that\nmigrate up the crypt wall toward the luminal surface. As the cells\nproceed up the crypt they differentiate into colonocytes, en-\nteroendocrine cells, and Goblet cells (1). Once at the top, the\ncells either undergo apoptosis and\u0002or are shed into the lumen\nand transported away (4, 5).\nIn the murine small intestine, the journey of the cells from the\nbase of the crypt to its apex has been estimated to take between\n2 and 3 days (6), and all the cells in the crypt, apart from the stem\ncells, will be renewed over this period. The stem cells are\nassumed to have a cycle time of between 12 and 32 h with an\naverage of 24 h (7, 8). The transit cell population has an\nestimated cycle time of \u000111\u201312 h (4, 9).\nThe crypt is homeostatic with an equilibrium maintained\nbetween cell proliferation and cell loss due to death and shed-\nding. If this balance is shifted toward proliferation by, for\nexample, mutations that promote proliferation or inhibit apo-\nptosis, then neoplasia results (10\u201313). In the colon, such up-\nregulated cell proliferation is the first step toward adenoma\nformation and subsequent carcinogenesis (14, 15). Here we\npresent some simplemathematical models of the colorectal crypt\nwith the aim of identifying the key processes that may initiate and\naccelerate tumorigenesis.\nThere have been a number of models that have studied cell\npopulation dynamics in the crypt, including the computational\nmodels by Paulus et al. (16, 17), Gerike et al. (18), and Meineke\net al. (19), and the deterministic models by Boman et al. (20) and\nHardy and Stark (21). One of the earliest and most influential\nmodels is that of Tomlinson and Bodmer (22), which we use as\nthe starting point for our study. That model assumes that the cells\nin the crypt can be assigned to one of three different compart-\nments: stem cells, semidifferentiated cells (transit-amplifying\ncells), and fully differentiated cells (Fig. 1). At the end of each\ncell cycle, stem cells and semidifferentiated cells are assumed to\ndie (through apoptosis), differentiate, or renew with constant\nprobabilities a1, a2, a3, and b1, b2, b3, respectively, where a1 \u0002\na2 \u0002 a3 \u0003 1 and b1 \u0002 b2 \u0002 b3 \u0003 1. These probabilities can also\nbe interpreted as the proportions of each cell population dying,\ndifferentiating, and renewing. The fully differentiated cells are\nassumed to be removed from the system (through death or\nshedding) with probability (or proportion) c in a given time.\nTo formulate equations for the population of stem cells\n(denoted N0), semidifferentiated cells (denoted N1), and fully\ndifferentiated cells (denoted N2) after each cell division, Tom-\nlinson and Bodmer (22) implicitly assumed that the cell divisions\nin each population were synchronous, which requires the cell\ncycle time of stem cells (denoted t0) to be an integer multiple of\nthe cell cycle time of semidifferentiated cells (denoted t1). The\nequations in ref. 22 are, however, not completely accurate, as\nthey neglect the asynchronicity induced if t0\u0002t1 is not an integer,\nas well as the compounding effect of semidifferentiated cells\ncycling more frequently than stem cells. Despite this, Tomlinson\nand Bodmer were able to predict that failure of apoptosis, or of\ndifferentiation, could lead to either exponential growth or a new\nequilibrium at higher cell numbers, and that failure of these\nprocesses was sometimes sufficient but not necessary for tumor-\nigenesis, as this could also be achieved by a proliferative advan-\ntage. These observations can be used to explain premalignant\ngrowths, and the stepwise growth of tumors that occurs between\nlong lag phases.\nOur first aim in this paper is to remove the requirement of\nsynchronicity from the model of Tomlinson and Bodmer, taking\ncareful account of the different cell cycle times of stem and\nAuthor contributions: C.M.E., W.F.B., P.K.M., and S.J.C. designed research; M.D.J., C.M.E.,\nP.K.M., and S.J.C. performed research; and M.D.J. and S.J.C. wrote the paper.\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\nFreely available online through the PNAS open access option.\n\u00a7To whom correspondence should be addressed.

This requires a more complicated set of\nequations, in which we keep track not only of the number of cells\nbut also of their age distribution. Since we are interested in the\ndevelopment of cell populations over timescales much longer\nthan the cell cycle time, we also formulate a much simpler model\nin which growth occurs continuously rather than in discrete\nmultiples of cell cycles. Such a model is much easier to analyze,\nand we show how the parameters in it may be related to those\nin the more detailed age-structured model.\nIf the transition probabilities of the process described in Fig.\n1 are constant [as assumed by Tomlinson and Bodmer (22)], then\nthe resulting equations are linear, and the model is structurally\nunstable, that is, a small change in some of the parameters can\nlead to a qualitative change in the solution. For example, unless\nexactly half the stem cells renew (a3 \u0003 1\u00022), the stem cell\npopulation will exhibit either exponential growth (a3 \u0004 1\u00022) or\nexponential decay (a3 \u0005 1\u00022).\nTo achieve homeostasis in any physical or biological system,\nsome degree of feedback is necessary to maintain stability in the\nface of infinitesimal parameter changes. One approach to mod-\neling homeostasis in the crypt is to allow the proportions of\ndeath, differentiation, and renewal to vary as the cell population\nsizes change. A step in this direction was taken by d\u2019Onofrio and\nTomlinson (24), who extend the model of Tomlinson and\nBodmer (22) by allowing b1 and b3, the dying and renewing\ntransit cell proportions, to depend on the size of the transit\npopulationN1 and differentiated cell populationN2. Our second\naim in this paper is to introduce two alternative forms of\nfeedback that are able to maintain homeostasis in the crypt, and\nto use these to provide a possible explanation for the long lag\nphases of tumor growth after successive mutations before un-\nregulated cell division occurs.\nGeneralizing the Modeling Approach\nThe Age-StructuredModel for Asynchronous Cell Division.To remove\nthe constraint of synchronous cell division, we need to keep track\nof the distribution of cell age in each population, that is, we need\nan age-structured model [see, for example, Murray (25)].\nWe denote byNi\u0003 Ni(t, a), for i\u0003 0, 1, 2, the age distribution\nfunction for cells of populationNi at time t, so that there areNi\u0001a\ncells in the age range [a, a \u0002 \u0001a]. We assume that each cell is\ncommitted to dying, differentiating, or renewing only at the end\nof its cell cycle, and that this process is instantaneous. Recall that\nwe denote the cell cycle times of stem and semidifferentiated\ncells by t0 and t1, respectively, and because the fully differenti-\nated cells are not progressing through the cell cycle, we follow\nTomlinson and Bodmer (22) in introducing a corresponding\nreference time t2 for fully differentiated cells after which they\nmay die or be shed. Since cells are assumed not to die, divide, or\ndifferentiate during their cell cycle, conservation of cell numbers\nimplies\n\u0002Ni\n\u0002t\n\u0003\n\u0002Ni\n\u0002a\n\u0004 0, 0\u0005 a\u0005 ti , [1]\nfor i \u0003 0, 1, 2, which has the general solution Ni(t, a) \u0003 f(t \u0006 a)\nfor some function f, corresponding to cells simply aging in time.\nThe renewal, death, or differentiation of the cells at the end of\nthe cell cycle gives the following conditions:\nN0\u0007t, 0\b\u0004 2a3N0\u0007t, t0\b, [2]\nN1\u0007t, 0\b\u0004 2b3N1\u0007t, t1\b\u0003 2a2N0\u0007t, t0\b, [3]\nN2\u0007t, 0\b\u0004 2b2N1\u0007t, t1\b\u0003 \u00071\u0006 c\bN2\u0007t, t2\b. [4]\nTaking Ni(0, a) \u0003 ni(a), 0 \u0005 a \u0005 ti, as the initial age profiles\nfor the cell populations Ni, for i \u0003 0, 1, 2, we can solve for the\nstem cell population immediately as\nN0\u0007t, a\b\u0004 \u00072a3\bnn0\u0007nt0\u0003 a\u0006 t\b, [5]\nwhere n is the unique integer such that (n \u0006 1) t0 \u0005 t \u0006 a \u0007 nt0,\ncorresponding to the number of times cells of age a have been\nthrough the cell cycle at time t.\nTo solve for N1 we need to make some assumption about the\ninitial distribution of cell ages. The simplest case to consider is\nthat in which the cells all start at age zero, so that ni(a) \u0003 n\u02c6i\u0001(a),\nwhere n\u02c6i is the initial total population of cells of type i, and \u0001 is\nthe Dirac \u0001-function.

We therefore now de-\nvelop a much simpler ordinary-differential equation (ODE)\nmodel which allows for continuous cell division.\nThe Continuous Model. Here we assume that we are interested in\ntimes much greater than the cell cycle time, and that the cell\npopulations are large enough that we can assume that they vary\ncontinuously with time, rather than taking only integer values.\nDenoting the per-capita rate of stem (respectively semidiffer-\nentiated) cell proliferation by \b3 (respectively \t3), differentiation\nby \b2 (respectively \t2), and death by \b1 (respectively \t1), and the\nper-capita removal rate of fully differentiated cells by \n, the\nODE model is\ndN0\ndt\n\u0004 \u0007\b3\u0006 \b1\u0006 \b2\bN0 , [11]\ndN1\ndt\n\u0004 \u0007\t3\u0006 \t1\u0006 \t2\bN1\u0003 \b2N0 , [12]\ndN2\ndt\n\u0004 \t2N1\u0006 \nN2 .

In the age-\nstructured model, we consider proportions of the cell popula-\ntions dying, differentiating, or renewing at discrete time inter-\nvals, whereas in the continuous model, we assume that these\nprocesses occur continuously and we work with the rates at which\nthey occur. To compare the models, it is important to be able to\nrelate the two sets of parameters, which is the goal of this section.\nIn the age-structured model, for the case where all the cells in\neach population are initially synchronous in their cell cycles, we\nhave the general solution 6\u20138.

The approximation of the age-structured model by the\ncontinuous model assumes that the cell populations are varying\non a timescale much longer than that of the cell cycle, that is, that\nthe renewal proportions are close to 1\u00022.

In this case the\ncondition C \u0003 C\u02c6 is automatically satisfied.\nSteady States and Structural Instability. It is clear from 14\u201316 and\n19\u201321 that both the age-structured and continuous models are very\nsensitive to the cell population renewal proportions a3 and b3 or net\nproliferation rates \b and \t. A nontrivial steady state can occur only\nif a3\u0003 1\u00022, corresponding to \b\u0003 0. If a3\u0004 1\u00022 (\b\u0004 0), the model\nexhibits exponential growth, whereas if a3\u0005 1\u00022 (\b\u0005 0), themodel\nexhibits exponential decay. When a model requires a parameter to\ntake a particular value for its solutions to have the required\nbehavior, the model is said to be structurally unstable. In biological\nsystems, we expect there to be noise, and so such a model will be\nunrealistic. There is a similar but less stringent requirement on b3\nand \t. For b3 \u0005 1\u00022 (\t \u0005 0), there is a nontrivial steady state,\nwhereas for b3\u0004 1\u00022 (\t\u0004 0), there is exponential growth. We will\nmodify the model to include feedback in the following section,\nwhich will stabilize the model structurally.\nFirst, we briefly examine the steady state of the continuum\nmodel. With \b \u0003 0, \t \u0005 0 (and of course \n \u0004 0), the solution\n14\u201316 approaches the steady state\nN*0\u0004 n\u02c60 , N*1\u0004 \u0006\n\b2n\u02c60\n\t\n, N*2\u0004 \u0006\n\b2\t2n\u02c60\n\t\n\n, [25]\nas t 3 \t, where the stem cell population is equal to its (undeter-\nmined) initial value, n\u02c60, and the other populations are determined\nin terms of this. The results of Tomlinson and Bodmer (22)\nessentially correspond in this model to observing that altering the\nvalue of \t (or indeed \b2, \t2, or \n) while keeping \b \u0003 0 can lead to\na new steady state in the size of the populations, without necessarily\nleading immediately to exponential growth so long as \t stays\nnegative.\nModeling Homeostasis in the Crypt\nWe discussed above the need for some form of feedback to\nstabilize the model to infinitesimal changes in the parameters.\nThis has been recognized by d\u2019Onofrio and Tomlinson (24), who\nextended the difference equation model by Tomlinson and\nBodmer (22), by allowing density dependence in the proportion\nparameters to model homeostasis in the crypt.\nHere we present two possible feedback mechanisms that could\nmaintain the equilibrium in the crypt. With the first mechanism,\nwe find that the feedback is strong enough to preclude unlimited\ngrowth whenever it is present, so that cancerous growth can only\noccur if the feedback is assumed to have been knocked out by a\ngenetic alteration. With the second mechanism, we find that\nunlimited growth in cell numbers can occur even in the presence\nof feedback if changes in the other parameters in the model drive\nthe net growth rates above a critical value.\nFeedback Model 1: Linear Feedback. One way in which the cells\ncould act to maintain homeostasis is by altering the proportion\nof cells differentiating in response to changes in the cell popu-\nlation sizes. We assume that when the population of stem or\nsemidifferentiated cells increases the (per-capita) rate at which\nthey differentiate increases in proportion. Thus we replace \b2\nand \t2 in Eqs. 11\u201313 by, respectively, \b2 \u0002 k0N0 and \t2 \u0002 k1N1,\nwhere ki \u0004 0 are constants, giving\ndN0\ndt\n\u0004 \u0007\b3\u0006 \b1\bN0\u0006 N0\u0007\b2\u0003 k0N0\b, [26]\ndN1\ndt\n\u0004 \u0007\t3\u0006 \t1\bN1\u0006 N1\u0007\t2\u0003 k1N1\b\u0003 N0\u0007\b2\u0003 k0N0\b, [27]\ndN2\ndt\n\u0004\u0006\nN2\u0003 N1\u0007\t2\u0003 k1N1\b . [28]\nThus the stem cells exhibit logistic growth, with a carrying\ncapacity of N*0 \u0003 \b\u0002k0, where, as before, \b \u0003 \b3 \u0006 \b1 \u0006 \b2. If\n\b \u0004 0 all solutions of 26 are attracted to this stable steady state;\nif \b \u0005 0 all solutions are attracted to N0 \u0003 0. We see that there\nare no values of the parameters (providing k0 \u0004 0) that allow\nunbounded growth in N0.\nFor the semidifferentiated cells, there is one positive, stable,\nsteady state given by\nN*1\u0004\n1\n2k1\n\u0004\t \u0003 \b\t2\u0003 4k1N*0\u0007\b2\u0003 k0N*0\b\u0005, [29]\nwhere, as before, \t \u0003 \t3 \u0006 \t1 \u0006 \t2, which exists for all values\nof the parameters. Again, no value of the parameters leads to\nexponential growth.\nThus this model predicts that, providing the renewal rate of\nstem cells, \b3, is bigger than some critical size \b1 \u0002 \b2, the stem\ncell population is able to sustain itself and reaches a nonzero\nsteady state. A change in the parameters of the model (corre-\nsponding to a genetic hit) will change the value of the steady state\ncell populations, but only a genetic hit which removes the\nfeedback in the model will lead to unbounded growth.\nFeedback Model 2: Saturating Feedback.Here we again assume that\nwhen the population of stem or semidifferentiated cells increases,\nthe rate at which they differentiate increases, but instead of\nassuming a linear dependence of per-capita rate on population\nsize, we assume that there is a maximum per-capita rate of\ndifferentiation. Thus we replace \b2 and \t2 in Eqs. 11\u201313 by,\nrespectively, \b2 \u0002 k0N0\u0002(1 \u0002 m0N0) and \t2 \u0002 k1N1\u0002(1 \u0002\nm1N1), where mi \u0004 0 are constants.

[32]\nDenoting \b \u0003 \b3 \u0006 \b1 \u0006 \b2 as usual, we find that the extinct state\nN0\u0003 0 is unstable for \b\u0004 0 and globally attracting for \b\u0005 0; thus\nwe require \b \u0004 0 for the crypt to be viable. A further steady state\nof stem cells, corresponding to homeostasis, exists when\b lies in the\nrange 0 \u0005 \b \u0005 k0\u0002m0, and is given by N*0 \u0003 \b\u0002(k0 \u0006 m0\b).

Thus we see the possibility of successive genetic hits\nincreasing \b (either by increasing the proliferation rate, or decreas-\ning the differentiation or death rates) moving the crypt through\nincreasing steady state cell populations, until finally \b exceeds the\ncritical value and unbounded growth occurs.\nWhen the stem cell population is steady, the behavior of the\nsemidifferentiated cell population depends on whether \t\u0003 \t3\u0006\n\t1 \u0006 \t2 is greater or less than the critical value k1\u0002m1. If \t \u0005\nk1\u0002m1, there is a single, real, positive steady state for the\nsemidifferentiated cell population given by\nN*1\u0004\n1\n2\u0007k1\u0006 \tm1\b\n\u0004\t \u0003m1D\u0003 \b\u0007\t \u0006m1D\b2\u0003 4Dk1\u0005, [33]\nwhere D \u0003 \b2N*0 \u0002 k0N*02\u0002(1 \u0002 m0N*0) \u0003 (\b3 \u0006 \b1)N*0 is the\nstem-cell differentiation rate. If \t \u0004 k1\u0002m1, then the transit cells\nexhibit unbounded growth. Here again we have the possibility of\nsuccessive genetic hits increasing \t (either by increasing the\nproliferation rate, or decreasing the differentiation or death\nrates) moving the crypt through increasing steady state cell\npopulations, until finally \t exceeds the critical value and un-\nbounded growth occurs.\nWe demonstrate this process with the following example,\nillustrated in Fig. 2. Consider the initial parameter set \b\u0003 0.286,\n\t \u0003 0.432, \n \u0003 0.323, \b2 \u0003 0.3, \t2 \u0003 0.3, k0 \u0003 0.1, m0 \u0003 0.1,\nk1\u0003 0.01, andm1\u0003 0.01. This produces critical threshold values\n\b \u0003 k0\u0002m0 \u0003 1 and \t \u0003 k1\u0002m1 \u0003 1; the population is therefore\nstable, with N*0 \u0003 4, N*1 \u0003 85, N*2 \u0003 200. Suppose a first\nmutation (in either \t1 or \t3) raises \t to 0.512; then N*0 is\nunchanged, butN*1\u0003 114, N*2\u0003 294. A secondmutation making\n\b\u0003 0.5 produces a new steady state ofN*0\u0003 10, N*1\u0003 134, N*2\u0003\n361. A third mutation making \t\u0003 0.697 produces a steady state\nof N*0 \u0003 10, N*1 \u0003 266, N*2 \u0003 847. If a fourth mutation causes\n\t \u0003 1.1, there is no steady state for the semidifferentiated cell\npopulation, and consequently both it and the fully differentiated\ncell population grow exponentially.\nThis process simulates the widely assumed multistage process\nof carcinogenesis. Successive mutations could cause parameter\nchanges which incrementally raise the size of the steady state.\nHowever, once the mutations have accumulated to a certain\ndegree, and the parameters are raised above a certain threshold,\nunregulated cell population growth occurs and the tumor grows\nexponentially.\nWe conclude this section by summarizing the behavior of the\nthree different models in different regions of the (\b, \t)-\nparameter space. For the model without feedback, the line\n\b \u0003 0, \t \u0005 0 corresponds to finite crypt size, the region \b \u0005 0\nand \t\u0005 0 corresponds to crypt extinction, and the regions \b\u0004 0\nand \t\u0004 0 correspond to unbounded growth. For the model with\nlinear feedback, the region \b\u0004 0 corresponds to finite crypt size,\nand the region \b\u0005 0 corresponds to crypt extinction. Finally, for\nthe model with saturating feedback, the region \b \u0005 0 corre-\nsponds to crypt extinction, the region 0 \u0005 \b \u0005 k0\u0002m0 and\n\t \u0005 k1\u0002m1 corresponds to finite crypt size, and the regions\n\b \u0004 k0\u0002m0 and \t \u0004 k1\u0002m1 correspond to unbounded growth.\nThese regions are illustrated in Fig. 3.\nDiscussion\nWe have presented some mathematical models that try to\ncapture the behavior of the cell populations in a healthy crypt in\nthe colon. We have corrected and extended the Tomlinson and\nBodmer model (22) by producing two different types of models\nto capture the asynchronous division of cells. The age-structured\nmodel is able to keep track of all cells regardless of when they\nare generated in their cell cycles, and the continuous model is\neasier to analyze mathematically. We have shown that the\ncontinuous model is a good approximation to the age-structured\nmodel when the cell populations vary on a timescale that is much\nlonger than that of a cell cycle.\nBoth of these models are very sensitive to small changes in the\nparameters, so we introduced two different types of feedback to\nmake the continuous model structurally stable and to capture the\nregulation of cell numbers that occurs in the crypt. The first\nFig. 2. An illustrative sequence of mutations (occurring every 100 days) in the\nsaturating feedback model (feedback model 2). The initial parameters are\ntaken to be \b\u0003 0.286, \b2\u0003 0.3, \t\u0003 0.432, \t2\u0003 0.3, \n\u0003 0.323, k0 \u0004 0.1,m0 \u0004\n0.1, k1 \u0004 0.01, and m1 \u0004 0.01. The mutations cause, successively, \t \u0003 0.512,\n\b\u0003 0.5, \t\u0003 0.697, \t\u0003 1.1. For \t\u0003 1.1 there is no steady state and unbounded\ngrowth occurs.\nFig. 3. Plots of the regions of stability of the cell population models for no\nfeedback (i), linear feedback (ii), and saturating feedback (iii). In the case of no\nfeedback, there are only stable solutions on the line \b \u0003 0, \t \u0005 0; otherwise,\nthere is either extinction or unbounded growth. In the case of the linear\nfeedback, there is never unbounded growth in cell numbers, and there is a\nsteady state if\b\u0004 0, and extinction if\b\u0005 0. For the saturating feedback, there\nis a strip of the parameter space that permits stable solutions, when 0 \u0005 \b \u0005\nk0\u0002m0 and \t \u0005 k1\u0002m1, and outside this region there is either extinction or\nunbounded growth. The crosses correspond to the five states in the (\b,\n\t)-parameter space from Fig. 2.\n4012 \u0001 www.pnas.org\u0002cgi\u0002doi\u000210.1073\u0002pnas.0611179104 Johnston et al.\nfeedback controlled the system growth so that there was always\na stable equilibrium and exponential growth in cell numbers\ncould not occur unless mutations were able to knock out the\nfeedback. The second form of feedback allowed stable equilibria\nin a certain range of parameters but also permitted uncontrolled\ngrowth in the cell populations if the parameters were pushed\nabove a critical threshold. These different ranges of stability are\nillustrated in Fig. 3.\nThe key parameters are the net per-capita growth rates of the\nstem and transit cell populations, which represent renewal minus\ndeath and differentiation. So, in particular, the failure of pro-\ngrammed cell death or differentiation could lead to tumor\ngrowth, as concluded from the model by Tomlinson and Bodmer\n(22), as well as an increased proliferation rate.\nThe second form of feedback could help explain the observed\nlag phases after mutations occur, and thus the existence of\nbenign tumors or adenomas before carcinogenesis takes over.\nEarly mutations in the adenoma-carcinoma sequence could raise\nthe net per-capita growth rates but keep them below their critical\nvalues, which will create new, higher steady states. Later stage\nmutations could push the net per-capita growth rates above their\ncritical values, ensuring that unregulated cell population growth\noccurs. However, if no genetic changes occur that take a tumor\nout of the range corresponding to finite size in Fig. 3, then it\nremains benign. Although the evidence supports the view that\nessentially all colorectal cancers go through an adenoma, or\nbenign phase, by no means do all adenomas develop into\ncarcinomas.\nIn conclusion, mutations in any of the key parameters (death,\ndifferentiation, or renewal rates for the stem cells or transit cells)\ncan initiate tumorigenesis, and eventually exponential growth in\ncell numbers leading to a carcinoma, but it is only changes in the\nnet per-capita growth rates that are important, and then only\nwith a suitable feedback model.\nWe acknowledge the support provided by the funders of the Integrative\nBiology project: the EPSRC (GR\u0002S720231\u000201) and IBM.
