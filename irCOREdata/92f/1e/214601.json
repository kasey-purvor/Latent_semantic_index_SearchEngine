Using the example of arms exports to developing countries, the \npresent paper exposes the organized hypocrisy underlying countries\u2019 self-declared ethical \nturn. We show that the major Western arms supplying states \u2013 France, Germany, the UK \nand the US \u2013 have generally not exercised export controls so as to discriminate against \nhuman rights abusing or autocratic countries during the post-Cold War period. Rather, we \nuncover ongoing territorial egoism, in that arms have been exported to countries which \nserve supplying states\u2019 domestic economic and security interests.  \n   \nKeywords:  Arms; human rights; democracy; ethical; foreign policy; geopolitics \n \n 3 \nIntroduction \n \nA defining feature of geopolitics over the past two decades has been the extent to which \nWestern political leaders have placed ethical and moral considerations at the heart of \ntheir foreign policy discourse (Chandler 2003; Dodds 2005; Slater and Bell 2002). In \npractice, this has meant different things in different countries, and the centrality ascribed \nto ethical concerns has waxed and waned across and within political administrations. Yet \nit has invariably included a heightened commitment to promote human rights and, to a \ngreater or lesser extent, discursive endorsement for the principle of protecting or \nadvancing democracy in extra-territorial spaces (Gaskarth 2006; Manzo 2003; Perkins \nand Neumayer 2008; Webber 2001).  \nFor geographers, Western powers\u2019 self-declared ethical foreign policy is of \nparticular interest. Assertions about the need to consider the rights, freedoms and well-\nbeing of distant strangers script a geographic imaginary of a universal moral space where \neveryone, everywhere is governed by the same moral rules, and a stretching of state \nresponsibility to protect beyond the national territory (Dodds 2005; Flint and Falah \n2004). Public declarations by Western elites to pursue a value-based foreign policy signal \na more cosmopolitan, post-sovereign geopolitical order whereby international politics is \nincreasingly guided by shared principles and norms, and state power is deployed in order \nto tackle non-territorial challenges of global justice (Beck 2006; Behr 2008; Rosenau \n1990). Accompanying these discursive scripts has been a reworking of notions of the \nnational interest. Acting to protect extra-territorial citizens is not only the \u201cright thing\u201d to \n 4 \ndo, but according to recent public statements, also the \u201cself-interested\u201d one (Cook 2002; \nHancock 2007; Sparke 2007). \nA central question is whether this scalar construction of state morality, \nresponsibility and geopolitical interests \u2013 laced with utopian visions of a world society \nbuilt upon universal values, shared rules and mutual gains \u2013 amounts to anything more \nthan empty rhetoric. Certainly, liberal visions of an ethically-motivated, post-sovereign \nstate identity sit rather uncomfortably with (neo-)realist accounts, which portray states as \nselfish actors, primarily concerned with the defence of national interests of economy and \nsecurity. One area where these disparate models of state action are likely to come to the \nfore is arms transfers. As part of their ethical commitments, many Western governments \nhave pledged to consider human rights and (to a lesser extent) democratic conditions in \ndeciding whether to sanction weapons exports from their territories. Yet implementing \nthese obligations to protect universal rights at the international level might plausibly \nconflict with self-help, materialist national interests of economy and security. Have states \nreformed and rescaled their national interests and normative concerns such that they are \nwilling to privilege the interests of distant strangers over conventional commercial and \nsecurity imperatives? \nIn order to address this question, we examine whether the West\u2019s four major arms \nexporting countries \u2013 France, Germany, the UK and the US \u2013 have discriminated against \nhuman rights abusing and autocratic states, in the sense of (a) refusing to export weapons \naltogether or (b) restricting the amount of exports such that they receive a lower relative \nshare of their overall weapons transfers. Building on theories of organized hypocrisy, we \nsuggest that they are unlikely to have done so, with actual arms control practices \n 5 \ndecoupled from ethical commitments (Brunsson 1989; Krasner 1999). Supporting our \nargument, we find very little evidence that Western countries have systematically \ndiscriminated against states with poor levels of human rights or democratic freedoms. \nRather, we uncover ongoing territorial egoism, in that arms have been exported to \ncountries which serve supplying states\u2019 domestic economic and security interests.  \n \nOrganized Hypocrisy \n \nOur central argument in the present paper is that Western countries\u2019 value-based arms \ncontrol policy and practice is best understood in terms of organized hypocrisy \u2013 that is, \ninconsistent talk and action, arising from contradictory interests, obligations and \nincentives (Brunsson 1989; Krasner 1999; Lipson 2007). Although the concept can be \ntraced to sociological notions of \u201cdecoupling\u201d (Meyer and Rowan 1977), it is Krasner\u2019s \n(1999) conceptualisation of organized hypocrisy that is most instructive in relation to \nquestions about foreign policy. After March and Olson (1979), Krasner identifies two \nlogics which govern actors\u2019 behaviour: logics of consequences, which conceives \n\u2018political action and outcomes, including institutions, as the product of rational \ncalculating behaviour designed to maximise a given set of unexplained preferences\u2019 (i.e. \ninstrumental, materialist), and logics of appropriateness, which \u2018understand political \naction as a product of rules, roles and identities\u2019 (i.e. normative, ideational) (Krasner \n2001, p.175-176). For Krasner, logics of consequences frequently take precedence over \nlogics of appropriateness in world politics, giving rise to organized hypocrisy. Countries\u2019 \n 6 \nrulers \u2018rhetorically embrace\u2019 international norms, rules and roles, but responding to \ndomestic materialist imperatives, act in ways that contradict normative commitments.   \nUnderlying organized hypocrisy, Krasner argues, is a number of features of the \ninternational system. Most fundamentally, perhaps, is its anarchical nature. Inter-state \ncompetition for wealth, power and influence means that the compulsion for domestic \ngovernments to defer to domestic consequential logics is strong. Conversely, norms at the \ninternational level are characteristically weakly institutionalised, often ambiguous and \nvulnerable to defiance by powerful states.  \nNot all scholars subscribe to the view that logics of consequences, on the one \nhand, and logics of appropriateness, on the other, can be treated as two entirely separate \ncausal systems (Fearon and Wendt 2002; March and Olsen 1998). According to one line \nof argument, therefore, many actions equated with materialist motives involve a \nnormative dimension. Hence, defending the economic or security interests of a \nterritorially-bounded electorate may be the self-interested course of action, but it can also \nbe interpreted as part-and-parcel of domestic politicians\u2019 normative obligations. Another \nrelated line of argument maintains that normative concerns are themselves constitutive of \ninterests and that norm compliance may be governed by calculative expectations of \nconsequences. \nWe are partly sympathetic to these arguments and, in line with several recent \ncontributions, would submit that materialist interests and moral obligations are \u2018not \nmutually exclusive and are interconnected in several ways\u2019 (Herrmann and Shannon \n2001, pg.622). Hence particular choices, actions and representations may be guided by \nboth sets of logics (March and Olsen 1998). We nevertheless believe that logics of \n 7 \nconsequences and appropriateness remain useful analytic concepts, especially in \nsituations involving trade-offs between domestic economic and security interests, on the \none hand, and non-territorial normative obligations which prescribe right and wrong, on \nthe other.  \n \nArming the Third World \n \nArms transfers are another area where states might be expected to encounter competing \ninterests, obligations and incentives. Arms are big business. As an indication: the total \nvalue of the global arms trade over the period 1992-2004 is estimated at roughly US$269 \nbillion (1990 prices), of which roughly US$185 billion comprised sales to developing \ncountries (SIPRI 2007). According to nearly all measures, the US is by far the largest \nsupplier of arms to developing countries, accounting for close to 40% of transfers \nbetween 1992-2004. The other \u201cbig\u201d four are Russia, France, Germany and the UK. The \nlatter three countries were together responsible for almost 20% of arms transfers over the \nsame period, while Russia accounted for approximately 30.5%.  \nAlthough a handful of countries dominate the transfer statistics, globalization of \nthe defence industry over recent decades means that a growing share of the components, \nsub-modules and modules that go into making many weapons systems are manufactured \nin a number of different economies (Garcia-Alonso and Levine 2007; Lovering 1994). \nStill, control, co-ordination and final assembly activities continue to be managed largely \nby firms headquartered in the traditional arms supplying countries, such that government \n 8 \nexport controls in these territories exert a potentially decisive influence over the \ndestination of finished weapons.1 \nThere is nothing especially new in Western arms control. According to Krause \nand Latham (1998), the concept has its roots in the early Cold War period, underpinned \nby strategic motives to reduce the risks of an escalating East-West conflict. Later on, \nduring the 1970s and 1980s, humanitarian principles began to assume a growing role in \nWestern arms policy (Cooper 2000). As an example, President Carter introduced a new \nset of US export guidelines in 1997, which included a clause to \u201cpromote and advance \nrespect for human rights in recipient countries\u201d (Klare 1998, pg.86).  \nStill, humanitarian concerns occupied a comparatively marginal position prior to \nthe 1990s, with restrictions garnering only limited political traction in practice (Krause \nand Latham 1998). With the end of the Cold War, however, Western governments have \nsought to reinvigorate their support for a more ethically-grounded arms control regime. \nIndeed, consistent with their rearticulated rhetorical support, Western arms exporting \ncountries have adopted new or revised arms control policies prohibiting or discouraging \narms exports to regimes which infringe particular principles, particularly on human \nrights. In the US, Presidential Decision Directive (PDD) 34 issued in 1995 affirmed the \ncountry\u2019s moral commitments by stating that, \u201cThe United States will act unilaterally to \nrestrain the flow of arms\u2026where the transfer of weapons raises issues involving human \nrights\u201d (The White House 1995). The UK government also adopted revised criteria for \n                                                 \n1\n All cross-border arms transfers \u2013 together with dual-use components which could potentially be \nused to manufacture weapons \u2013 from Western arms exporting countries require government \nexport licences. \n 9 \narms export licenses in the 1990s, with Britain\u2019s foreign secretary boldly announcing, \n\u201cLabour will not permit the sale of arms to regimes that might use them for internal \nrepression or international aggression\u201d (Cook 1997). France and Germany have similarly \nincorporated policy principles which call for an evaluation of human rights conditions in \nrecipient countries in deciding whether to sanction exports (Yanik 2006).  \nAccompanying these domestic initiatives during the post-Cold War period have \nbeen a set of new multilateral agreements and codes governing arms transfers. The first \nof these, the European Council\u2019s Declaration on Non-Proliferation and Arms Exports, \nwas issued in 1991. It was soon followed by the Organization for Security and Co-\noperation in Europe\u2019s (OSCE) Criteria on Conventional Arms Transfers (1993) and the \nEuropean Union\u2019s (EU) Code of Conduct on Arms Exports (1998)2. Common to the \nabove are a set of principles which participants are expected to take into account when \nsanctioning arms exports. Amongst others, all three agreements\/codes mention respect for \nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms, consideration of the internal situation (i.e. \nexisting tension and armed conflict) and the legitimate defence and security needs of the \nrecipient. Although none of the existing multilateral agreements are legally binding, they \nnevertheless provide a set of common guidelines, and confer clear responsibilities on \nparticipants. \n \nThe Paradox of Ethical Commitments \n \n                                                 \n2\n France, Germany and the UK have been party to all three codes, whereas the US was a signatory \nto OSCE agreement. \n 10 \nWestern countries\u2019 value-based arms control initiatives would appear to script a \ngeopolitics of hope (Sparke 2007) \u2013 a more cosmopolitan geopolitical order in which \nsovereign states act in the defence of non-territorial principles. Together with more \ngeneral public statements about ethics in foreign policy, such initiatives can be seen as a \nproduct of emerging norms of human rights and democracy at the international level, \nwhich have ascribed new rules, roles and obligations to sovereign states (Dodds 2005, \nSchmitz 2004; Solomon 2006). Amongst others, these norms script states\u2019 rulers as \nguardians of extra-territorial human rights and democratic freedoms, and create duties \nand expectations for these actors to act in ways consistent with safeguarding or \npromoting liberal democratic principles beyond national borders. \nYet acting according to these logics of appropriateness \u2013 by limiting arms exports \nto human rights abusing and\/or autocratic regimes \u2013 might well clash with consequential \nlogics in two possible ways. First, it is likely to be inconsistent with the commercial \ninterests of defence firms located in the national territory, as well as individuals \nemployed by these companies. Although analysts have questioned the net benefits \nderived by national economies from arms exports (Chalmers et al 2001; Dunne and \nFreeman 2003; Hartung 1999), weapons manufacture may nevertheless be a significant \nemployer in certain regions, and a symbolically important source of export revenue. \nIndeed, perceptions matter, and vested interests have been instrumental in sustaining the \nimage that arms exports are central to ongoing national prosperity. By undermining the \neconomic fortunes of domestic arms vendors, as well as the job security of workers \nemployed in these firms, enforcing ethically-motivated restrictions will inevitably run \ncounter to powerful vested interests. Included here are the interests of political \n 11 \nrepresentatives in jurisdictions where defence firms have a significant presence or who \nreceive support from arms manufacturers. \nAnother way in which logics might clash is rooted in geopolitics. Arms play a \n(potentially) important role in maintaining alliances, with Western countries historically \nrestricting sales to unfriendly states, and preferentially supplying friendly, client or \ngeostrategically important regimes (Agnew and Corbridge 1995; Sislin 1994).3 As \nstressed by classical and neo-realists, military (and to a lesser extent) other alliances are \nimportant for states\u2019 domestic security, and therefore a central aspect of countries\u2019 \nnational self-interests that are extra-territorial in nature (Flint and Falah 2004; \u00d3 Tuathail \n1992). The imperatives of military security, on the one hand, and compliance with norms \ngoverning the defence of human rights and democratic freedoms, on the other, may \ncollide where allies are characterised by human rights abuses or limited democratic \nfreedoms.  \nWe believe that political leaders are likely to have \u201cmanaged\u201d these conflicting \npressures, forces and logics by resorting to organized hypocrisy. Territory and the \ncorrelative activity of defending the state space \u2013 together with promoting the interests of \nits bounded community \u2013 remain at the heart of the current geopolitical order (Dodds \n2005). Although this system is far from a straightforward struggle of \u201call against all\u201d, \ngrowing global competition between arms manufacturers and ongoing (real, perceived or \nconstructed) security threats to the national territory, mean that the incentive to defer to \nconsequential, materialist interests in the case of arms is likely to remain strong. Indeed, \n                                                 \n3\n Note, the supply of weapons to certain states is known to have had some unintended \nconsequences, such as heightened terrorism against the supplying state\u2019s own citizens (Neumayer \nand Pl\u00fcmper 2009). \n 12 \nto the extent that Western political rulers depend on the support of a territorially-bounded \nelectorate whose interests in domestic economy frequently take precedence over other \nconsiderations, we expect domestic politicians to privilege commercial concerns \n(Abrahamsen and Williams 2001; Flint 2004). Going further, it could be argued that \nnormative obligations felt by domestic political leaders to defend the economic and \nsecurity interests of their own citizens may trump normative rules prescribing the defence \nof extra-territorial others. \nThere will likely be exceptions: where human rights abuses in potential recipient \nstates are especially acute, or where leaders show blatant disregard for democratic \nprinciples, state rulers may respond to normative obligations regarding humanitarianism \nand democratic freedoms by enforcing export restrictions. International outrage, \nincreased domestic pressure and heightened concerns about reputation might transform \nthe protection of extra-territorial individuals\u2019 rights from a matter of largely normative \naction (i.e. \u201cwhat is the appropriate thing for me to do\u201d), to one that incorporates a greater \nelement of self-interested, materialist concerns (i.e. \u201cwhat is in my self-interests?\u201d). Yet \nwe believe that such instances are likely to be rare. For the most part, governments will \nseek to meet normative expectations to protect distant strangers through symbolic \npolitics, i.e. talking about their values, making public pledges to consider human rights \nand democratic conditions, and endorsing non-binding principles. Actual behaviour is \nlikely to be largely decoupled from these commitments. Accordingly, we expect Western \npowers will generally be no more likely to transfer weapons to Third World countries \nwith good human rights and democratic records as bad ones, nor discriminate in terms of \nthe volume of sales. \n 13 \nInstead, to the extent that states privilege or discriminate in sanctioning their arms \nexports, we expect four relational\/extra-territorial factors which contribute to serving the \nnational interest to be important. The first is geopolitical ties, including military alliances, \nbut also colonial linkages. On the supply-side, these boundary-spanning relationships are \nlikely to increase the willingness of arms exporters to supply weapons, and possibly \nsupply them at reduced or zero prices. Likewise, on the demand-side, importing countries \nmight be more willing to purchase weapons from their allies and\/or former colonial \nmasters, with whom they often (but not always, in the latter case) share friendly or \ncooperative relations. \nAnother geopolitical factor is domestic security. Arms transfers potentially give \nrise to a negative security externality on the exporting country, with the risk that one\u2019s \narms exports are ever used to threaten one\u2019s own security greater for countries which are \ngeographically proximate (Garcia-Alonso and Levine 2007). We therefore logically \nexpect that, with the exception of participants involved in regional security-cum-defence \ncommunities, countries to be more reluctant to sell weapons to geographically proximate \ncountries. A third relational correlate is economic. Owing to their role in supporting the \ndomestic prosperity of its citizens, and the importance of maintaining good diplomatic \nrelations, we suspect that more economically significant trading partners stand a greater \nchance of being granted weapons. Fourth, and along similar lines, it follows that \ncountries might be more inclined to purchase arms from states which import a larger \nshare of their domestic goods and services (Hyde-Price 2000). \n \nCross-country Variations \n 14 \n \nAn important question is whether we should expect differences between individual \nWestern states. While relatively little comparative work has been undertaken in this field, \nthe literature nevertheless points to two factors which might influence the extent to which \nstates are willing to sacrifice domestic economy and security concerns in the name of \npromoting human rights or democratic freedoms in extra-territorial spaces. One is power. \nAccording to Krasner (2001, p.176), \u201cstronger states can pick and choose from amongst \nthose norms that best suit their material interests, or ignore norms altogether\u201d. Similar \nobservations have been made in relation to the ability of the world\u2019s hegemon (i.e. the \nUS) to resist external normative pressure or to impose its own rules (Flint 2004). Applied \nto the present case, it could well be that more powerful states are better-placed to \nprivilege their domestic economic and security interests by exporting weapons to regimes \nwith poor records of human rights and democratic freedoms, and therefore engage in \norganized hypocrisy.  \nA second factor is domestic institutions. According to an influential body of \n(new) institutionalist work in political science, countries are characterised by nationally-\nidiosyncratic institutional traditions, which directly or indirectly shape policy choices \n(North 1980). Amongst these institutional factors, countries might plausibly differ in the \nextent to which norms of defending human rights and democratic freedoms in foreign \nspaces are domestically institutionalised, and therefore the degree to which they enter \nlogics of governments\u2019 action.  \nAt the broadest level, scholars have drawn from elements of the above to strike a \ncontrast between the foreign policy of the EU and the US. Hence, founded on universal \n 15 \nnormative principles such as peace, consolidation of democracy and fundamental human \nfreedoms, it is suggested that the EU\u2019s external policy is frequently guided by notions of \nthe \u201cright thing to do\u201d (Manners 2002; Toje 2008). Included here are the defence or \npromotion of human rights and democratic principles in extra-territorial spaces \u2013 \nactivities consistent with the Union\u2019s post-modern vision of sovereignty and its assumed \nstatus as a \u201ccivilian\u201d or \u201cnormative\u201d power. Conversely, a combination of norms of \nexceptionalism, a Westphalian conception of sovereign autonomy, and \u201chard power\u201d \nmeans that US foreign policy has tended to be more unilateralist, strategically \ninstrumental and self-serving (Kagan 2004; Smith 2004). \nAlthough useful, such binary contrasts between the EU and the US run the risk of \nproducing exaggerated caricatures, and failing to capture important aspects of countries\u2019 \nforeign policy identity, interests and behaviour. The US may well be characterised by \nunilateral exceptionalism, but the country is also unique in the degree to which \ndemocratic ideals enter foreign policy discourse, a trait that Moss (1995) ascribes to \nAmerica\u2019s historic foundation upon liberal ideals. Correspondingly, the US has assumed \na lead role in spreading democracy worldwide, a moral cause frequently invoked by \npolicy-makers as constitutive of the national interest (Barkan 2004; Chandler 2003; \nSparke 2007). \nWe can also identify variations amongst European states. For Hyde-Price (2000, \np.39), \u201cGerman identity has been reconstructed in opposition to the excessive nationalism \nof the past and the militarisation of German patriotism that it involved.\u201d Accordingly, \ndomestic interests have been defined around Western values, with human rights and \ndemocracy occupying a prominent position in foreign policy discourse (Erb 2003, p.221). \n 16 \nThe British and French, partly as a function of their history as colonial powers, have \nsought to maintain a more independent, geostrategically-oriented foreign policy. For sure, \nboth countries have incorporated notions of human rights protection (and, to a lesser \nextent, democratic freedoms) into their conceptions of the national interest, and have \nbeen frontrunners in promoting human rights internationally (Wong 2006). Yet the \ngeneral opinion is that commercial and geostrategic imperatives have continued to \ncommand significant influence over foreign policy decisions and have frequently \ntrumped moral considerations (Carmona 1998; Chandler 2003; Power 2000). \n \nPrevious Work \n \nNotwithstanding the possibility that states may behave differently, we nevertheless \nremain sceptical towards Western powers\u2019 ethical turn, and their willingness to \nimplement self-declared commitments by restricting the sale of arms to countries that \nviolate human rights and democratic norms. Previous work mostly endorses our \nscepticism. A number of case-studies have therefore documented the transfer of weapons \nfrom Western states to countries with dubious human rights and democratic practices \u2013 \nfor example, the British export of Hawk jets to Indonesia (Amnesty International 2006; \nCooper 2006; Gaskarth 2006). Other studies have made use of descriptive statistics to \ndemonstrate more systematic patterns of neglect of ethical principles. Berrigan et al \n(2005), for instance, reports that 13 of the top 25 recipients of US arms transfers in 2003 \nwere defined as \u201cundemocratic\u201d by the country\u2019s State Department. Similarly, Yanik \n(2006) reports that over the period 1999-2003, France, Germany, the UK and the US \n 17 \nrespectively exported weapons to 12, 5, 9 and 32 countries defined as \u201cundemocratic\u201d or \n\u201cpartially democratic\u201d by Freedom House4. Dunne and Freeman (2003) report that 19.1% \nof UK arms exports \u2013 by value for the year 2001 \u2013 went to \u201chighly sensitive\u201d countries, \nwhich include those with an \u2018undemocratic regime with a grave and consistent pattern of \nhuman rights abuses\u2019 (pg.14).    \n  While the above studies paint a rather dismal account of recent practice, a more \npositive picture emerges from Blanton\u2019s (2000, 2005) statistical work. Departing from \nprevious studies, the author makes use of a two-stage decision-making econometric \nmodel to estimate the influence of human rights and democracy on US arms exports. The \nfirst focuses on the qualification decision, i.e. whether a country is eligible to receive \narms, and for the sub-set of countries that qualify, the second stage examines the \nallocation decision, i.e. the volume of arms to transfer. For samples covering the post-\nCold War period, Blanton finds that human rights abusing countries are less likely to \nqualify (stage one) for US transfers, while more democratic countries also have a greater \npropensity to receive arms. She also finds that democracies exhibit a greater probability \nof receiving a larger amount of arms, although human rights do not seem to matter in this \nsecond stage. \nYet does this mean that other contributions to the literature have generated a \nmisleading impression of Western countries\u2019 arms transfer practices? Any answer to this \nquestion, of course, is complicated by the fact that different studies use very different \nevaluative criteria. Focusing on a small number of high-profile examples, many case-\n                                                 \n4\n Freedom House is a US non-profit organization which compiles data on the state of freedom and \ndemocracy in countries around the world, see: www.freedomhouse.org. \n 18 \nstudy contributions have adopted a largely absolutist conception: the export of weapons \nto any country with dubious human rights or democratic credentials is taken as evidence \nthat countries have ignored their ethical commitments. Studies based on an analysis of \ndescriptive statistics, meanwhile, have interpreted neglect on the basis that Western states \nhave exported weapons to a significant number of countries in violation of self-declared \nethical principles. Blanton relaxes these criteria. For her, the issue is not whether \ncountries export weapons to human right abusing or autocratic regimes, but whether they \nare less likely to export weapons or export a lower share their of overall weapons to these \ncountries. \nWe are sympathetic to Blanton\u2019s approach, not least because it acknowledges that \nethical behaviour may be just as much evidenced by what countries do (i.e. discriminate \nagainst certain countries in sanctioning weapons exports), as what they do not. We are \nalso sympathetic to Blanton\u2019s large-sample, econometric approach. It allows the \ninfluence of human rights and democracy to be isolated, namely, by controlling for other \ndeterminants which might plausibly shape the destination of arms transfers. Amongst the \nlatter are various interest-related factors which provide useful clues as to underlying \nmotivations. An econometric approach also allows a large number of recipient countries \nand years to be examined, and therefore to determine whether arms transfer patterns hold \nacross multiple cases. \nAccepting a less restrictive conception of ethically-motivated behaviour, the real \nquestion becomes whether Blanton\u2019s findings are exceptional. It could well be that her \nresults are simply the result of country selection, data source or statistical specification. \nOur goal in the present paper is therefore to undertake a new econometric analysis of \n 19 \narms transfers. Our approach differs from Blanton\u2019s in a number of important ways. First, \nand perhaps most fundamentally, we examine a larger sample of arms exporting \ncountries. As well as the US, we examine transfers from France, Germany and the UK. \nOur reason for selecting these four countries is that they not only accounted for roughly \n60% of total arms transfers to developing countries between 1992-2004, but also for the \nvast bulk of the West\u2019s arms transfers to the Third World during this period. \n Second, we use a different dependent variable, which has both advantages and \ndisadvantages compared to Blanton\u2019s.5 The major advantage of our dependent variable is \nthat it is based on a volume measure of cross-border arms transfers (i.e. the amount of \nphysical equipment transferred multiplied by trend indicator dollar values). Conversely, \nBlanton uses a dependent variable that captures the dollar value of arms agreements (i.e. \nlicensed memorandums of sale between arms sellers and arms purchasers). Compared to \nour measure, the US Department of Defence\u2019s foreign military sales (FMS) measure used \nby Blanton potentially underestimates true levels of cross-border arms flows, owing to \nthe fact that national governments sometimes provide arms to recipients free of charge or \nsell them at a heavily discounted price. On the downside, while Blanton\u2019s dependent \nvariable records both small and large weapons, the Stockholm International Peace \nResearch Institute (SIPRI) data used for our dependent variable only captures the latter. \nEven if we were to use the FMS data for the US, a basic lack of comparable bilateral data \non small arms transfers in the case of Germany, France and the UK means that we could \nnot make like-for-like comparison between the four countries. \n                                                 \n5\n We do not wish to enter a prolonged debate here on the relative merits of these measures, \nalthough we return to discrepancies between the two in discussing our results later in the paper.  \n 20 \n \nMethod \n \nThe Estimation Model \n \nSimilar to Blanton, our estimation approach distinguishes between two decision-making \nstages, qualification and allocation. This is warranted for both substantive reasons (arms \nexporters are likely to first screen out countries to whom they do not export at all before \ndeciding on how much to export to those deemed eligible) and statistical reasons (a large \nshare of zero values violates the assumptions according to which ordinary least squares \nproduces unbiased and efficient results). At the qualification stage, a dummy variable is \nused as our dependent variable \u2013 set to one if a country receives arms from the exporting \nstate under investigation, and to zero if a country receives no arms. In the allocation \nstage, the variable to be explained is the share of the exporter\u2019s total arms transfers that a \nspecific developing country receives.6 Underlying our use of share (as opposed to the \nabsolute level) is the fact that we are primarily interested in whether there are systematic \ndifferences in the geographic pattern of an individual Western country\u2019s arms allocation \ndecisions across developing countries, rather than why certain exporters transfer more \narms overall than others.  \nA two-staged estimation strategy allows us to test whether human rights and \ndemocracy are used as criteria to systematically screen out certain countries from \n                                                 \n6\n In order to better conform to the requirements of OLS, we take the natural log of the allocated \narms transfer share variable.  \n 21 \nreceiving arms altogether, or merely as criteria for limiting the amount of arms \ntransferred. The latter could arise where a government wishes to restrict exports of \nparticular weapons (e.g. tanks). For estimating the first stage, we use a so-called logit \nestimator, which is standard practice where the dependent variable is a dummy variable. \nFor the second stage, we apply ordinary least squares (OLS). Standard errors are \nclustered on recipient countries in both cases.7 If the error terms of the two stages were \ncorrelated with one other, then it would be preferable to estimate them jointly, rather than \nindependently. In this case, the use of a so-called Heckman (1979) sample selection \nmodel, which estimates both stages jointly, would be warranted. Yet tests suggest that the \ntwo stages can be treated as independent. We therefore report results for the separate logit \nand OLS models below.8  \n  \nThe Dependent Variables \n \nData on arms transfers were provided to us directly by the Stockholm International Peace \nResearch Institute (SIPRI). Our sample covers the period 1992-2004. We select 1992 as \nour start date because this marks the beginning of a new wave of major ethically-\nmotivated arms transfer initiatives by leading Western arms exporters.  \n                                                 \n7\n This accounts for the fact that observations from the same potential recipient country over time \nare not independent from each other. In practical terms, clustering ensures that standard errors are \nnot under-estimated. \n8\n Note, our results are fully robust to using the Heckman model. \n 22 \n Ongoing globalization of the defence industry has greatly complicated the \ncollection of arms transfer statistics. As Brauer (2007, p.975) observes, \u201ca sale \noriginating in any one state may still be credited to that state but production is as likely to \ntake place in a variety of locations around the globe\u201d. Nevertheless, to the extent that \nSIPRI\u2019s data are based on reports of licensed transfers from particular countries, the fact \nthat production is more geographically fragmented than the statistics report does not pose \na particular problem for the purposes of the present study. \nSIPRI\u2019s data cover major conventional arms transfers \u2013 namely, aircrafts, armored \nvehicles, artillery, radar systems, missiles, ships and engines for military aircrafts, ships \nand armored vehicles \u2013 owing to the absence of reliable statistics on cross-border flows \nof small arms and light weapons. While much of the conflict literature has focused on \nsmall weapons, it is worth noting that conventional weapons have also been widely used \nby governments\/combatants to commit human rights abuses, or for autocratic regimes to \nmaintain their grip on power (Amnesty International 2006; Goldring 2006). The non-\ninclusion of small weapons will mean, however, that we miss some arms exports. \nSIPRI attempts to measure the volume of major arms transfers and values these \nby trend indicators of unit production costs, rather than the actual price paid (Smith and \nTasiran 2005). This suits us because the SIPRI measure is closer to the real value of the \narms exports, whereas the purchase price may well reflect other factors, including \npolitical considerations. There is some measurement error of course in the dependent \nvariable (Smith and Tasiran 2005), but since there is no reason why this measurement \nerror should be systematically correlated with out explanatory variables, we see no major \nreason for concern. \n 23 \n \nThe Explanatory Variables \n \nArms transfers in any one year are likely to lag licensing decisions by governments, such \nthat they will logically be influenced by conditions in preceding years. We therefore lag \nall of the explanatory variables by two years.9 Our explanatory variables of central \ninterest are the extent to which developing countries (a) respect human rights and (b) \nhave a democratic political system. For human rights, we use a measure provided by \nGibney (2007), who employs information from US State Department and Amnesty \nInternational reports on human rights conditions. Gibney\u2019s measure runs from 1 to 5, \nwith 1 indicating a state of affairs in which the rule of law prevails, people are not \nimprisoned for their political views, torture is rare or exceptional and political murders \nare extraordinarily rare, and 5 representing widespread political imprisonment, torture, \ndisappearances and political murders. Democracy is captured by Marshall et al\u2019s (2006) \nwidely-used polity2 indicator. The measure is derived from expert judgments on aspects \nof institutionalized democracy and autocracy within a country. Polity2 runs from -10 to \n10, with -10 representing a totally authoritarian political system, and 10 representing full \ndemocracy. Inevitably, with their emphasis on civil and political aspects, our measures \nadopt a largely \u201cWestern\u201d conception of what constitutes human rights and democracy \n(Dodds 2005)10. Yet we do not believe this to be especially problematic in the present \n                                                 \n9\n Our results are robust to using a one-year lag or no lag at all. \n10\n To take one example: in debates over human rights, China\u2019s political leadership has frequently \nplaced far greater store on social and economic rights than civil and political ones. \n 24 \ncontext where our concern is whether Western powers abide by their own standards of \nhuman rights and democracy. \nWe run two sets of regressions: one where human rights and democracy variables \nare continuous, and another where they are dummies capturing the most autocratic \n(polity2<=-7) and human rights violating (pts>=4) countries. Although our predominant \nfocus is on the former, we are nevertheless interested in whether our results hold when \nconsidering the \u201cworst offenders\u201d, countries (e.g. Saudi Arabia) which have figured \nheavily in debates about the practical implementation of countries\u2019 ethical foreign policy \ncommitments (Jenkins 2007). \nWe also include additional explanatory variables that attempt to capture national \neconomic and geopolitical interests of Western arms exporters. Beginning with the \nformer, our model includes the value of bilateral trade as a share of the supplier\u2019s gross \ndomestic product (GDP), with data taken from Gleditsch (2002) and World Bank (2006). \nWe also include a dummy variable that is set to one if a developing country is allied to \nthe arms exporter (data from Leeds (2005)). If states were indeed to act in ways \nconsistent with their domestic security interests, we should logically expect them to \ntransfer more arms to countries with which they share a military alliance. We additionally \ninclude a dummy variable for former colonies in the case of European exporters. As \ndocumented in the literature, ex-colonizers often exhibit ongoing interests in Third World \nstates that were once part of their empire, such that an instrumental, materialist foreign \npolicy might increase the willingness of relevant governments to sanction arms exports \n(Power 2000; Slater and Bell 2002; Wong 2006). As an additional geopolitical, interest-\n 25 \nbased variable, we include the absolute distance between the capital cities of the exporter \nand developing country, using data from Bennett and Stam (2005). \nFinally, with a view to isolating the effects of supply and demand-side factors, we \ninclude control variables which capture the demand for arms imports. Although modeling \narms demand is notoriously difficult, we attempt to approximate it by using three \nvariables previously identified in the literature (Brauer 2007; Smith and Tasiran 2005). \nThe first is a variable which measures \u2013 on a 0-3 scale \u2013 the intensity of armed conflict in \n(potential) recipient countries, be it an international conflict or, more likely, a civil war \n(data from Gleditsch et al (2002)). A country engaged in armed conflict should plausibly \nexhibit a higher demand for arms. Second, based on the observation that richer countries \ncan better afford to pay for expensive weaponry than poorer ones, we use per capita GDP \n(using data from World Bank 2006) as a proxy for ability to pay. Third, we include a \nmeasure of the domestic military capacity of (potential) developing-country recipients, as \nwell as its squared term to allow for a non-linear effect of capacity on demand for arms \nimports. This follows the common argument in the arms transfer literature that countries \nwith very limited military capacity have low demand for arms imports because they have \nno use for them, whereas countries with very high military capacity have low demand for \narms imports because they have enough capacity to produce arms domestically, such that \nit is the countries with medium military capacity that should have the highest demand. \nWe employ the Correlates of War project\u2019s Composite Index of National Capacity \n(CINC) score, which is a composite measure of military expenditures, population size \nand energy consumption.11 \n                                                 \n11\n Data from http:\/\/correlatesofwar.org\/. \n 26 \n \nResults \n \nTable 1 details our statistical results for the complete sample of developing countries. For \neach sender, we report two sets of coefficients, corresponding to the selection and \nallocation stages, respectively. We begin with our main explanatory variables. At the \nselection stage, coefficients for our human rights variable are statistically insignificant in \nall cases, suggesting that human rights conditions have made no difference to whether (or \nnot) developing countries have received weapons from any of the major Western arms \nsupplying states. Identical results are obtained at the allocation stage for the three \nEuropean states. However, in the case of the US, a positive and statistically significant \ncoefficient suggests that human abusing states have actually received a greater share of \nthe country\u2019s arms overall transfers.  \n \n<<INSERT TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE>> \n \n At the selection stage, results for democracy are similar to human rights, in that \nestimated coefficients for our measure of democratic polity are statistically insignificant \nfor all four exporters. Results for stage two, concerned with allocation shares, are more \nvariable. As in the first stage, we find that the US has failed to discriminate amongst \ncountries according to whether they are more or less democratic, at least in terms of the \nvolume of weapons transferred. For France and the UK, the results are even more \nstriking: a negative and statistically significant coefficient indicates that more autocratic \n 27 \ncountries have actually received a greater share of French and British weapons. Yet we \nfind precisely the opposite for Germany: our estimated coefficient in the second stage is \npositive and statistically significant. \nWhat other factors are systematically correlated with arms transfers from the four \nWestern arms exporting countries? Three (largely, supply-side) attributes appear to have \nbeen influential, although some geographic variability is apparent. One is the presence of \na military alliance. As indicated by positive and statistically significant coefficients, allies \nof Germany, the UK and the US are more likely to have qualified for arms transfers from \nthese countries. With the exception of Germany, however, a similar positive relationship \ndoes not carry through to the allocation stage. Another correlate is spatial proximity. Our \nestimations suggest that the French, British and Americans have been more willing to \nsupply weapons to countries which are further away. A similar relationship exists for the \nUS in the second stage, but for none of the other countries, where the distance coefficient \nis statistically insignificant. A third factor is bilateral trade as a share of the exporting \ncountry\u2019s GDP. In the first stage, a positive and statistically significant relationship exists \nin the case of France, the UK and the US. In the second stage, only Germany and the US \nhave statistically significant coefficients, both of which are positive as expected.  \nWith respect to our control variables, as anticipated, we estimate a positive and \nstatistically significant coefficient for GDP per capita at the qualification stage for all \nfour countries. At the allocation stage, GDP per capita is only statistically significant in \nthe case of the US and France, again with a positive sign. Also conforming to \nexpectations, we find that military capacity is positively and statistically significantly \ncorrelated with arms transfers from all four countries, both at qualification and allocation \n 28 \nstages. In line with the literature, increasing military capacity first raises the likelihood of \narms imports and then, after a threshold has been reached, decreases it.12 The same is true \nfor volume: countries of medium military capacity import more arms than either \ncountries of low or countries of high military capacity.  \nConflict-intensity in the recipient state is largely insignificant. The only \nexceptions are France and the US at the second stage. Previous studies have generally \ninterpreted similar findings as evidence that countries have failed to live-up to their \nethical pledges. However, in the absence of data on whether these conflicts involved the \n\u201clegitimate\u201d use of force, we simply note here that our results do not contradict the basic \ntenet of organized hypocrisy. \nWe now turn to our secondary estimations, where the continuous version of our \nvariables of main interest are replaced with dummy variables, capturing the most human \nrights violating and autocratic countries. We briefly summarize findings without \nreporting them in a regression table. Only two basic results change. First, our human \nrights coefficient for US transfers becomes positive and statistically significant at the \nqualification stage, mirroring identical findings at the allocation stage. Second, the \ncoefficient for democracy becomes insignificant for Germany in the second stage \nestimation, whereas it was previously positive and statistically significant. Similarly, the \nimportance of economic and geopolitical considerations hardly changes. For our military \nalliance variable at the first stage, the coefficient moves from statistical insignificance to \n                                                 \n12\n Further military capacity increases will then eventually have a negative effect on arms imports, \nbut the estimated coefficients and the distribution of the military capacity variable suggest that \nthis is only relevant for developing countries at the very top end of military capacity. \n 29 \nbecome positive and statistically significant in the case of France, while for Germany, the \npositive and statistically significant coefficient is rendered statistically insignificant. All \nof the other variables of substantive interest remain basically unchanged.  \nAccepting these cross-country differences, our findings nevertheless broadly \ncontradict results from the only other large-sample, econometric work, which has \ninvestigated the links between US arms transfers and liberal democratic principles \n(Blanton 2005, 2000). Why the discrepancy? One possible answer is data. As noted \nearlier, Blanton\u2019s dataset for US transfers features both large and small arms, whereas \nours\u2019 is restricted to the former. It could be that the US government has been more \nwilling to enforce export restrictions in the case of small arms. Similarly, arms sales \nagreements may fail to capture important post-contract dynamics. Considerable \ndiscrepancies exist in the statistics between the value of arms agreements and actual \ndeliveries which, if not randomly distributed across countries, would bias the estimation \nresults. \nAnother possible explanation is the specification of Blanton\u2019s estimation models. \nMissing from her models is military capacity which, according to previous work, is an \nimportant determinant of arms transfers (Smith and Tasiran 2005). Also missing are \nvariables for military alliances, trade and distance. The point here is that the omission of \nthese variables \u2013 and, by implication, the under-specification of Blanton\u2019s estimation \nmodels \u2013 might have contributed to her findings regarding human rights and democracy. \nClearly, more work is needed to scrutinize the underlying reasons for these discrepancies.  \n \n \n 30 \nConclusions and discussion \n \nIdeas of new beginnings, agendas and spatial horizons have long been a feature of the \ngeopolitical imagination (Agnew and Corbridge 1995). Since the early-1990s, one such \nimaginary (re-)scripted by Western political elites is that they have moved away from the \nstate-centric agenda of the Cold War era, dominated by purely self-interested concerns \nfor domestic economy, security and power. According to the rhetoric, a more ethically-\ngrounded foreign policy has taken its place, underpinned by universal moral principles \nand a commitment to promote the protection of rights and freedoms of extra-territorial \ncitizens. Critical geographers have been quick to criticize these and similar socio-spatial \nimaginaries. Amongst others, they have argued that such scripts have often performed \ncovert, instrumental roles. That is, rather than marking a more progressive moral turn in \nforeign policy action, they are part-and-parcel of a discursive strategy which seeks to \nlegitimize existing security agendas, economic interests and patterns of domination over \nspace (Flint and Falah 2004; O'Loughlin and Kolossov 2002; \u00d3 Tuathail 2000; Power \n2003; Roberts et al 2003; Sparke 2007).  \nIn the present paper, we set-out to scrutinize the alleged gap between political \nimaginaries and material outcomes, using the example of Western arms exports to \ndeveloping countries. Our basic thesis is that states\u2019 official commitment to a value-based \narms controls policy is largely a matter of symbolic politics \u2013 with countries reluctant to \nsacrifice national interests of economy and security in name of protecting or advancing \nthe rights and freedoms of extra-territorial citizens. Using quantitative data on large \n 31 \nweapons transfers from France, Germany, the UK and the US over the period 1992-2004, \nwe find evidence to support our arguments. \nAccording to our statistical estimations, neither human rights abuses nor \nautocratic polity would appear to reduce the likelihood of countries receiving Western \narms, or reduce the relative share of a particular exporter\u2019s weapons they receive. In fact, \nhuman rights abusing countries are actually more likely to receive weapons from the US, \nwhile autocratic regimes emerge as more likely recipients of weaponry from France and \nthe UK. Reinforcing the impression that extra-territorial ethical considerations are far \nfrom paramount, we show that the geography of Western arms exports is closely aligned \nwith self-interested, economically and geopolitically-important relational ties. Hence \ndeveloping countries which are more important trading partners exhibit a greater \nprobability of qualifying for arms, as generally do countries which fulfill the domestic \ninterests of the supplying state extra-territorially as military allies. Western countries \nhave not, it seems, systematically acted counter to more conventional, materialist \ninterests. \nOur statistical estimations say nothing about underlying causality, but it would be \ndifficult to square the above findings with behavioral explanations based solely on \nhegemony. If power were indeed the decisive variable, then the US should logically be \nexpected to have shown a greater propensity to defy international normative roles than \nthe three European states, both in the case of human rights and democracy. For sure, the \nUS hardly acts in the spirit of its self-declared ethical principles, but nor does France or \nthe UK. Both sets of countries have systematically contravened one principle or another. \n 32 \nGermany fares only slightly better with respect to democracy, but not human rights \nprotection. \nWhat seems to matter more, at least in defining what states can or cannot get \naway with, are domestic institutions (Donnelly and Liang-Fenton 2004). That the US is \nmore willing to overtly ignore human rights abuses than autocratic government is broadly \nconsistent with the idea that the country is, first and foremost, founded on democratic \nideals rather than humanitarian ones (Moss 1995). Although far from irrelevant, the \ndomestic appropriateness of defending or promoting democracy in non-domestic spaces \nwould appear to be less deeply institutionalized in Britain and France than in the US. \nInstead, partly as a consequence of their historic role in colonialism, norms of extra-\nterritorial responsibility are centrally defined around human rights.13 The idea that \ndomestic institutions matter is also supported by the German case \u2013 the country with the \n\u201cleast bad\u201d record regarding arms transfers. Germany\u2019s foreign policy identity, which \nwas formed in the shadow of an excessively autocratic, militaristic and human rights \nviolating past, is one where economic or geostrategic concerns are least likely to trump \nthe promotion of Western values (Erb 2003). \nWhat are the implications of our findings? Most obviously, by exposing the \nhypocrisy underlying geopolitical imaginaries of ethical foreign policy, they remind us of \nthe importance of interrogating the discursive constructions of political leaders (Flint and \nFalah 2004; \u00d3 Tuathail 1992; Roberts et al 2003). While a more ethically-grounded \nforeign policy may script a geopolitics of hope (Sparke 2007), underpinned by a \n                                                 \n13\n As noted earlier, human rights have formed the centre-piece of each country\u2019s ethical foreign \npolicy commitments, as well as the EU\u2019s Code of Conduct. \n 33 \ndeterritorialised concern for the well-being of a more spatially inclusive, cosmopolitan \nhumanity, our findings suggest that such socio-spatial narratives (potentially) conceal a \ngeopolitics of territorial egoism. In an important sense, therefore, our study speaks to \nwider debates about the changing boundaries of the modern state. Although it has become \npopular to talk about a blurring of domestic and foreign, and the emergence of a post-\nsovereign state identity, the findings of the present study suggest that it is important not \nto take this argument too far. Aspirationally and rhetorically, Western countries may \nsubscribe to a non-territorial conception of rights and duties, and envision a state whose \ninterests lie in promoting universal values across borders. Yet if the case of arms control \nis anything to go by, these universals have not generally dislodged the primacy of \nnational economic and geopolitical interests. Far from the borderless world envisaged by \nhyperglobalists, territorial borders would appear to continue to enframe economic and \ngeostrategic interests, and centrally guide Western states\u2019 foreign policy actions (Yeung \n1998). \nWe do wish to caveat these remarks. Our statistical estimations capture general \npropensities, such that results suggesting that individual Western powers are no less \nlikely to export arms to human rights abusing or autocratic countries cannot be taken as \nevidence that these countries\u2019 leaders have never embargoed arms sales on ethical \ngrounds. Our results also say nothing about the behavior of other major arms exporters \u2013 \nincluding non-Western ones (e.g. China and Russia). Still, the study\u2019s findings \nnevertheless paints a rather gloomy portrayal of Western countries\u2019 post-Cold War value-\ndriven foreign policy and serves as a reminder of some of the systemic contradictions \nopened by globalization (\u00d3 Tuathail 2000; Toje 2008). For now, at least, these \n 34 \ncontradictions would appear to have been frequently resolved through organizational \nhypocrisy in the case of arms. An important question is whether, looking into the future, \npromoting the rights and freedoms of distant strangers will become more deeply \ninstitutionalized among domestic actors to the extent that acting \u201cethically\u201d towards \nextra-territorial others truly becomes a consequential national interest similar to more \ntraditional economic and security concerns. \n 35 \nReferences \n \nAbrahamsen R., Williams P., 2001.
