Critical Reflections on Jock \nYoung\u2019s The Exclusive Society \n \nIntroduction \n \nThe Exclusive Society (1999) represents Jock Young\u2019s most recent addition to his long \nand distinguished corpus of criminological works. Quite apart from Young\u2019s stature \nas something of an \u00e9minence grise in the discipline, the book may be considered a \nnotable \u2018landmark\u2019 in criminological theory for a number of reasons. Firstly, as is \nwell known, Young\u2019s influential career has charted (and in important ways helped \ndrive) the various trajectories and disputes in \u2018Left\u2019 criminology from the 1960s \nonwards. Hence his writings provide the \u2018historian\u2019 of recent criminological thought \nwith insights into the perilous and contested attempts by self-styled \u2018left \ncriminologists\u2019 to negotiate a position of critical relevance within a politically charged \nand socially sensitive field. As such, this latest contribution to Leftist agenda-setting \nmight warrant careful scrutiny by those looking to discern new paths for critical \nthinking, in what continue to be troubled times for those committed to a socially \nprogressive treatment of crime and criminal justice. Secondly, the book represents an \nimplicit yet pointed chastisement of criminology\u2019s insular tendencies, delivered by \none of its own doyen. Perhaps more that any other recent contribution by an \nestablished criminological voice, the book attempts to open-up the discipline\u2019s \ndiscourse to developments in the cognate fields of social, cultural and political theory.  \nIn the various short reviews received since publication, the book\u2019s theoretical \nambition has garnered both considerable praise (Loader, 2000; Waite 2000; Lippens, \n2001) and provoked some incisive critical comments (Smith, 2000; Williams, 2000).  \nThis essay represents an attempt to reflect critically on Young\u2019s theoretical agenda \nand social-political prescriptions in a sustained manner. By doing so, we suggest, \nuseful insights can be garnered into both the ongoing difficulties faced by a leftist \ncriminology, and the equally dilemmatic character of the wider and influential \ndevelopments in social theory upon which it might seek to draw.  At the same time, \nwe can consider the problematic nature of narratives of modernity that over-\nhomogenise and universalise experiences of modern societies and their development.  \n\u2018Modernity\u2019 can be understood as a highly differentiated set of processes in which \n\u2018inclusion\u2019 for some is dependent upon \u2018exclusion\u2019 for others. \n  \nThe paper proceeds by first providing a theoretical synopsis of Young\u2019s \nargument in The Exclusive Society.  The second section examines this argument in \nrelation to Young\u2019s earlier Left Realism, arguing that, underpinning a dramatic \nredirection and revision of Young\u2019s work toward social, cultural and political \ntheorisation, are recognisable Left Realist tenets. The third section turns to the \nunacknowledged recuperation of sociological positivism underpinning Young\u2019s \nthesis, where Young\u2019s realism disposes him favourably toward developing a \ncriminological account that prioritises causative explanation over interpretation, and \nwhich locates criminogenic mechanisms in structural and cultural processes. We \nargue that in this regard Young\u2019s position is somewhat at variance with his depiction \nof \u201csocial positivism\u201d as an exhausted paradigm, located within the legislative \naspirations of a now obsolete \u2018modernity\u2019.  In the final section we examine the \ndepiction of this modernity, arguing that it represents what has been described \n(O\u2019Brien and Penna, 1996) as a narrative of modern society that obscures evidence of \nmodernity\u2019s exclusionary mechanisms, mechanisms that ensure that inclusion for \nsome can only be achieved through exclusion for others.  In other words, exclusion \nand inclusion are part and parcel of highly differentiated and asymmetric historical \nprocesses. \n \n \nA Theoretical Synopsis \n \nWhile various dimensions of Young\u2019s analysis will receive sustained attention \nthroughout this paper, it is both useful and appropriate to begin with a brief synopsis \nof the book\u2019s general argument and approach through a survey of the key themes that \norganise its arguments. \nIts basic conceptual coordinates can be discerned, in the first instance, from its \nsubtitle \u2013 \u2018Social Exclusion, Crime and Difference in Late Modernity\u2019.  These four \nterms demarcate the confluence of themes that provide both the book\u2019s substantive \nconcerns, and the theoretical and conceptual frame through which Young seeks to \naddress them. The yoking of \u2018social exclusion\u2019 with \u2018crime\u2019 intimates the deep-seated \ncausal connections that, according to Young, underpin and increasingly exacerbate the \n\u2018problem of crime\u2019, and simultaneously frustrate attempts to address this problem by \nsole recourse to the intensification of \u2018crime control\u2019 and\/or penal severity. In other \nwords, the book seeks to reconnect the \u2018crime debate\u2019 to that about socio-economic \nmarginalisation, in explicit rejection of those who advocate the authoritarian \n\u2018remoralisation\u2019 of a supposedly dysfunctional \u2018underclass\u2019 through social, legal and \neconomic sanctions (\u2018zero tolerance\u2019, \u2018prison works\u2019, \u2018welfare dependence\u2019, and so on \nbeing its familiar catchwords). Keeping abreast of shifting theoretical and policy \ndebates, Young casts the problem of marginality in the language of \u2018social exclusion\u2019 \nso as to highlight its multiple and inter-locking dimensions, supplementing the \ndiscourse on \u2018poverty\u2019 with a sensitivity to the extra-economic (social, political, \nspatial and cultural) dimensions of disenfranchisement. Yet, in good sociological \nfashion, Young isn\u2019t content to merely map the dimensions of social exclusion, but \nseeks to locate its genesis in both the structural and cultural transformation of \n\u2018modern\u2019 society.  \nStructurally speaking, the perpetuation of socio-economic precariousness is \nattributed to the \u2018crisis\u2019 of the post-war \u2018Fordist\u2019 regime of production, which \nprovided stable employment opportunities for an industrial working class, yoked to a \nwelfarist state strategy that sought to furnish social protection \u2018from the cradle to the \ngrave\u2019. This regime, Young argues, was fundamentally \u2018inclusivist\u2019 in orientation, \nseeking to accommodate a socio-economically diverse population within a framework \nthat combined work and welfare, buoyed up by a booming economy and (male) \u2018full\u2019 \nemployment. In this regime, the socially marginal and \u2018difficult\u2019 were approached as \navailable for incorporation. This regime underwent crisis, and subsequent \ntransformation, from the late 1960s onwards, yielding a set socio-economic \narrangements characterised by chronically high, casualised and unstable employment; \ndeskilling and devalorisation of manual labour; and the rise of a \u2018white-collar\u2019 and \nservice sector that drew increasing numbers of women into the labour market.  Hence, \nfor Young, currently entrenched patterns of socio-economic division and exclusion \nare the correlate of this structural crisis and subsequent \u2018post-Fordist\u2019 resettlement. \nThe increasing disparities in income distribution, along with the dismantling of \nwelfarist inclusion by a state in crisis, have served to further marginalize and \nstigmatise an already disadvantaged sector of society. The conditions of economic \nprecariousness prevalent throughout the social structure, and the persistent presence \nof a marginal 30% without employment or opportunity at its bottom, has fostered \nwidespread \u2018ontological insecurity\u2019 (Giddens, 1991) and fear. This has become \nmanifest in punitive scapegoating of the poor on the one hand; and on the other, the \nincitement of frustration, resentment and reactive violence on the part of the excluded \n(an argument which in notable ways parallels that of Young\u2019s erstwhile collaborator, \nthe late Ian Taylor, whose Crime in Context (2000) draws similar connections \nbetween crime, fear, exclusion and the post-Fordist transformation of \u2018market \nsociety\u2019). In short, a poisonous brew of market individualism and \u2018relative \ndeprivation\u2019 are crucial causal antecedents of both an explosion in crime and anti-\nsocial behaviour, and an increasingly frantic and repressive agenda of crime control \nthat seeks to manage its own \u2018residuum\u2019, the new \u2018dangerous classes\u2019.  \nThe socio-economic transformation of society has been paralleled by a socio-\ncultural reconfiguration, linked in part to the crisis of Fordism. For Young, the post-\nwar regime of production and consumption was anchored and reflected in a set of \nstabilised social institutions and homogeneous cultural identities. These included \ncommunity relations based on class and occupational affinity, and a nuclear family \nwith its attendant sexual division of labour. Paralleling recent arguments by Richard \nSennett (1998) and Zygmunt Bauman (2001), Young sees these older certainties \nundermined as their supporting socio-economic arrangements have undergone \nirretrievable breakdown. The result has been an explosion of \u2018difference\u2019, the \npluralisation and fragmentation of identities and lifestyles. These are today met with \ncontradictory responses, simultaneously valorising difference (under the guise of \nmarket individualism and consumer choice) on the one hand, and persecuting it (in the \nform of reactive and \u2018essentialist\u2019 yearnings to purify and restore a lost homogeneity) \non the other. Moreover, the dissolution of working class communities has bequeathed \nan urban landscape beset by predation and incivility, in which the poor prey upon \ntheir neighbours. However, Young eschews socio-economic reductionism in \naccounting for cultural change, by drawing upon the \u2018meta-theories\u2019 of \u2018reflexive \nmodernity\u2019, \u2018late modernity\u2019 and \u2018risk society\u2019 developed by the likes of Ulrich Beck \nand Anthony Giddens. From this viewpoint, the \u2018explosion of difference\u2019, and the \nfears and responses it engenders, are part of an inexorable inner dynamic of modernity \nitself, its tendency to reflexively undermine all existing socio-cultural coordinates, to \n\u2018detraditionalise\u2019 society, to \u2018set free\u2019 individuals to self-organise a social biography \nthat is increasingly contingent and malleable. Again, this incites a range of responses \nthat are ambivalent and contradictory: the celebration of individual liberation; \ndefensive introversion, privatism, and isolationism; the aggressive targeting of those \nidentified as the carriers of threatening cultural, sexual, gender or ethnic difference; to \na reactionary moralism that pins its hopes on restoring former certainties. Hence, \nthrough a series of theoretical associations, Young links crime, fear and incivility \n(their inexorable rise and the fearful responses they inspire) with both the release of \n\u2018difference\u2019 and the entrenchment of social divisions that are their structural and \ncultural determinants.    \nYoung\u2019s sociological analysis of this complex imbrication of social exclusion, \ncrime and difference is, in the latter parts of the book, supplemented by a foray into \npolitical theory, driven by a commitment to seek a forward-looking prescription for \nthe current malaise. He rejects backward-harking calls to restore the \u2018golden age\u2019 of \nthe post-war inclusive society, on both sociological and political grounds. \nSociologically, the clock cannot be turned back. Economic, technological and global \nsocial change have consigned to impracticality the formula of a centralist nation-state, \nproviding redistribution via welfare, and stability via Keynesian macro-economics.  \nSimilarly, socio-cultural homogeneity has given way to a discovery of difference and \notherness that cannot be simply effaced, no matter how much conservatives might \nhanker after \u2018Family Values\u2019 and the like, or nostalgic leftists might dream of a world \nof working class collectivism (along with its unarticulated white, male hegemony). \nMoreover, from a moral-political standpoint, such a return would merely reproduce \npernicious essentialisms, since the universalism of the old inclusive society always \nunderwrote an insidious violence, denying Others the right to exist on anything other \nthan its own terms. As an alternative, Young draws upon the recent political-\ntheoretical work of Nancy Fraser (1997), which attempts to find a rapprochement \nbetween the politics of economic redistribution and the more recent agenda of the \ncultural recognition of difference (or \u2018identity politics\u2019 as it\u2019s often called). For \nYoung, the redistributive imperative could be met by a radical \u2018meritocracy\u2019, one that \npermits the genuine connection of reward with merit, thereby offering sustainable \npaths out of economic exclusion and marginality (pp. 185-189). The aspiration for \ncultural recognition, on the other hand, could be met by a \u2018transformative \nmulticulturalism\u2019, in which \u2018low intensity\u2019 communities with permeable, non-\nessentialised identities and borders could co-exist (pp. 179-182). \n \nLeft Realism Revised? \n \nHaving charted the main theoretical coordinates and lines of argument presented by \nYoung, we can now turn to consider their cogency, significance and wider \ncriminological implications. Perhaps the first question, to many readers\u2019 minds, will \nconcern the relationship of Young\u2019s excursus to his previous work. Given our \nintroductory remarks about Young\u2019s pivotal role in the development of left \ncriminological thinking, it behoves us to reflect on the continuity or otherwise of this \nlatest work with the \u2018Left Realist\u2019 position that he pioneered in the 1980s (see, for \nexample, Young 1986, 1987, 1992). This work, of course, was the target of much \nopprobrium from those who, insistent upon flying the flag of \u2018critical criminology\u2019, \nsaw it as a capitulation to the law-and-order agenda of Thatcherism. For Young on the \nother hand, it was a necessary move to rescue Left criminology from its multiple \n\u2018Achilles heels\u2019: a \u2018romantic\u2019 propensity to \u2018idealise\u2019 crime as a form of class politics; \na \u2018denial\u2019 of people\u2019s experience of crime by dissolving it into a social construction; \nand the perceived self-absorption and political\/policy irrelevance to which critical \ncriminology had seemingly consigned itself (for an incisive examination of critical \ncriminology\u2019s recent career, trials, and tribulations, see Hall, 2002). Does Young\u2019s \nlatest work represent a reassertion of \u2018Left Realist\u2019 principles? It\u2019s reformulation? It\u2019s \nabandonment in favour of an alternative criminological paradigm or programme? The \nevidence, we would suggest, is contradictory.  \nOne recent reviewer, recalling \u201cthe heroic debates between left realists and \ntheir Others\u201d, discerns that Young \u201chas tried to move beyond them in The Exclusive \nSociety\u201d (Lippens, 2001: 570)1. This assessment alludes to the concerted criticism of \nLeft Realism on the grounds that, in its headlong rush to demonstrate its relevance for \n\u2018administrative criminology\u2019, it had fatally restricted its vision to an empiricist \nmapping of crime levels and distributions (manifest most notably in the centrality \naccorded to crime and victimisation surveys). In doing so, its critics argued, Young \nand his colleagues had consigned wider critical social, political and cultural reflection \nto the margins. The Left Realist drive for relevance had, in effect, taken a retrograde \nstep by foregoing the critical-theoretical apparatus (pioneered by Young amongst \nothers) that could situate crime in a wider framework capable of addressing the role of \nstate power, class politics, and the like, or of offering a cogent sociological account of \nits causes and genesis (see Sim et al, 1987; McMahon, 1988; Walklate, 1998). In this \nrespect, The Exclusive Society does indeed represent something of a volte face. Not \nonly have wider social, political and cultural theoretical debates been admitted, but \nthey have also come to take centre stage. Indeed, as Young notes in his \nAcknowledgements, the \u2018book started off as one on criminology and ended up as one \non cultural studies and political philosophy\u2019.  Moreover, the theoretical resources \nmobilised are manifold (a smorgasbord, one reviewer opined (Williams, 2000), and \npitch their accounts at the macro (or even \u2018meta\u2019) level, as they seek to chart \nwholesale, \u2018ephocal\u2019 transformations in social, cultural and political formations. \nHence Young, in attempting to insert \u2018crime\u2019 into the interstices of \u2018grand theories\u2019 \nabout \u2018modernity\u2019, seeks to bring criminological concerns into the broadest contextual \nfocus possible. \n                                                \n1\n Indeed, as Simon Cottee (2002: 388) has recently noted, Young\u2019s discussion of those positions \npreviously derided as \u2018left idealist\u2019 appears much more conciliatory in his latest work. \nHowever, this apparent discontinuity with Left Realism must be counter-\nbalanced by aspects of the book that demonstrate its enduring (if unacknowledged) \ncommitment to the principles staked-out by the earlier work. Hence another reviewer \nfelt confident in asserting that The Exclusive Society \u201chas continued to develop the \nmain themes of realism\u201d (Smith, 2000: 320). These include, firstly, the claim that \n\u2018street crime\u2019 is a \u2018real problem\u2019, and one that impacts disproportionately upon the \nalready marginalised and disadvantaged. Consequently, a Left criminology worth the \nname ought give it serious address, and attempt to find practical strategies for its \nreduction. Secondly, that inequity in the administration of justice exacerbates the \nproblem by fostering resentment and distrust of its agencies, thereby entrenching the \nproblem of crime; hence the promotion of a more equitable and sensitive application \nof criminal law is an important goal in leftist criminological initiatives. And thirdly \nthat, by way of an explanation for the (apparent) preponderance of crime perpetrated \nby those located in the most disadvantaged social positions, the concept of \u2018relative \ndeprivation\u2019 provides an indispensable resource.  At various points throughout the \nbook, Young reiterates these Left Realist claims: the Left Idealist refusal to treat \ncrime and its genesis as a serious problem (1); the tendency of labelling theory \n(presented here as proto-postmodernism) to view crime as a social construct (39-40); \nand the importance of \u2018relative deprivation\u2019 as an explanatory resource in addressing a \nreal increase in crime (48, 96) of which the disenfranchised working classes are both \nperpetrators and victims (16). Hence, underpinning what appears a dramatic \nredirection toward social, cultural and political theorisation, recognisable Left Realist \ntenets are indeed at play. However, continuities with Left Realism notwithstanding, \nthe turn to more recent trends in social and cultural theory effect a marked revision of \nYoung\u2019s criminological vision (and a not entirely beneficial one - we will say more on \nthis later in the essay).  \n \nThe Long Shadow of Sociological Positivism? \n \nFor the moment, we should like to focus upon another significant feature of the thesis \npresented in The Exclusive Society, namely its (unacknowledged) recuperation of \ntheoretical and methodological motifs associated with sociological positivism. This, \nwe suggest, takes two main forms: firstly, the book\u2019s implicit dependence upon \nempirically apparent patterns in offending as the basis for developing a causal \nhypothesis to explain said behaviour; and secondly, an explicit appropriation of \nRobert Merton\u2019s structural sociology of deviance. We tackle each of these dimensions \nin turn. \nThe basic rationale of Young\u2019s thesis is that recent decades have witnessed a \nprofound change vis-\u00e0-vis crime, namely that there has been an inexorable rise in \ncrime (along with associated forms of \u2018anti-social behaviour\u2019 and \u2018incivility\u2019). It is \nthis apparent \u2018crime problem\u2019 that necessitates Young\u2019s development of an \nexplanatory hypothesis that finds its causes in social exclusion, which in turn is the \neffect of social-structural and cultural transformations. Hence, for Young, there is an \nempirical social phenomenon (\u2018rising crime\u2019) that demands a sociological and \ncriminological explanation. Moreover, and perhaps even more tellingly, the reality of \na quantum rise in crime is derived from empirical regularities manifest in survey data.  \nIn other words, the entire raison d\u2019etre of the book depends upon there in fact having \nbeen a \u2018real increase\u2019 in crime, and the evidence for such an increase is derived from \nresults manifest in crime surveys. The faith placed by Young in such surveys as \nproviding conclusive evidence for a \u2018quantum rise in crime\u2019 (and, indeed, the \nmethodological conviction that techniques of empirical social measurement are able \nto conclusively uncover the \u2018reality\u2019 of crime) bespeak a quintessentially positivistic \nfaith in the measurability of crime as a \u2018social fact\u2019.  In fairness, Young devotes \nconsiderable attention to exploring, variously, the problem of the \u2018dark figure\u2019; the \nheretofore \u2018hidden\u2019 dimensions of crime uncovered by work on \u2018white-collar crime\u2019 \nand by feminist criminologists; and the role of criminal justice agencies in \nconstructing crime and its apparent levels and social distribution, as revealed \nvariously by labelling theory, left idealism, moral panic theory, abolitionism and \nsocial constructionism (35-45).   \n \nHowever, despite these (and other) critical \u2018deconstructions\u2019 of crime figures, \nYoung takes the reality of \u2018rising crime\u2019 as sufficiently robust as to pin the entire \nthesis of the book upon it. Implicitly, Young appears to be suggesting that the \ndevelopment of crime surveys (so favoured by Left Realism) have effectively \u2018filled-\nin the blanks\u2019 on the \u2018dark figure\u2019, thereby giving us a reliable view of the real \nunderlying patterns and trends in offending behaviour. This seems to fly in the face of \nwhat we know about the methodological limits of such survey methods, which cannot \njustifiably be deemed to give us a picture of crime that is in essence any more \n\u2018objective\u2019 than the \u2018official statistics\u2019 they sought to supplement or challenge (see, \nfor example, Michalowski, 1991; Nelken, 1994; Maguire, 1997).  Indeed, at various \npoints, Young slips between talk of \u2018rising crime figures\u2019, \u2018perceptions of crime\u2019 and \nsuch like on the one hand, and the \u2018rise in crime\u2019 on the other (17, 31-2, 35, 69, 122); \nhaving acknowledged that crime figures are socially and politically contingent \nconstructs that \u2018reveal\u2019 crime in different ways, Young then falls back into asserting a \nreal rise in crime, whose sole evidential basis are those very figures. In other words, \nsomething of an argumentative \u2018sleight-of-hand\u2019 enables Young to repeatedly claim \nan \u2018explosion of crime\u2019 (which is then subject to explanation), despite the manifold \nreasons why criminologists have come to look upon such empirical generalisations \nabout the \u2018reality of crime\u2019 with considerable scepticism. \nThe second strand of Young\u2019s \u2018positivism\u2019 relates to his appropriation of \nMerton\u2019s account of the social-structural causes of offending behaviour presented in \n\u201cSocial Structure and Anomie\u201d (1938).  It will be recalled that, in this sociological \nclassic, Merton located the causes of (working class) crime in the \u2018strain\u2019 effected by \ntensions between dominant culturally-defined goals and the unequal social \ndistribution of the legitimate means for achieving those goals. Young re-appropriates \nMerton, locating the causes of rising crime in the confluence between social exclusion \n(deprivation of legitimate means) and the rise of a set of cultural expectations that \nplace emphasis upon individual gains via the market mechanisms of a consumer \nsociety (culturally-approved goals) (48, 50, 85, 96). The salience of Merton\u2019s \nanalysis, originally formulated in relation to the individualistic, achievement- and \nmonetarily-oriented culture of American capitalism, resides in the rise of seemingly \nsimilar cultural values under the aegis of Thatcherism. The ascendance of a market-\noriented acquisitive individualism, combined with the atrophy of communal ties of \nworking-class solidarity, reproduces the culturally prescribed goals that featured in \nMerton\u2019s account. When combined with the systematically entrenched exclusion and \ndisenfranchisement of those at the \u2018bottom\u2019 of the social hierarchy, the conditions are \nestablished for the anomic adaptations so famously elaborated by Merton.   \nThere is considerable virtue in revisiting the \u2018classics\u2019 in addressing current \nconcerns (rather than consigning them to the scrap-heap of sociological and \ncriminological history by pronouncing their current irrelevance; or worse, casting \n\u2018political\u2019 aspersions on their supposed thraldom to contemporary b\u00eate-noirs such as \n\u2018Enlightenment universalism\u2019 or \u2018modernism\u2019). However, in turning to Merton, \nYoung concedes an obvious hostage to fortune. Reviving \u2018strain theory\u2019 also means \ntaking-on some of its more obviously apparent flaws. Most prominent amongst these \nis that Merton\u2019s account depends crucially upon there being a demonstrable \ndifferential distribution of offences across the class structure; it is precisely the \npreponderance of offending behaviour in the \u2018lower\u2019 social strata that warrants an \nexplanation for crime that emphasises exclusion from the legitimate opportunity \nstructure. Merton has been rightly criticised over the decades for having \nunproblematically assumed (on the basis of the available statistical evidence) that the \n\u2018lower\u2019 social classes were in fact responsible for a disproportionate amount of \noffending behaviour. Young, by making the same connection between social \nmarginality and offending behaviour, leaves himself vulnerable to this selfsame \nobjection. Moreover, as already noted, readers today are much more likely to look \naskance at an account that takes empirical measures of crime as sufficient evidence \nthat the problem of offending is a problem of the working (or \u2018under\u2019) classes. \nConversely, an account focussed on socially excluded offenders (and exclusion as a \nkey \u2018motivation\u2019 for offending) finds itself unable to adequately account for offending \nlocated amongst the \u2018powerful\u2019 elsewhere in the social structure. An account that \nplaces its emphasis so squarely on the excluded as the source of a massive rise in \ncrime (however sympathetically their plight is presented) threatens to unwittingly \nreproduce the centuries-old identification of criminal conduct with socially \nmarginalised groups. \nAt various points in the book, Young depicts criminological positivism as a \nmanifest failure; in particular, the causal explanation of crime as emanating from \u201cbad \nsocial conditions\u201d was exploded by the simultaneous rise in levels of prosperity and \ncrime in the post-War years (35). Young distances himself from this \u201csocial \npositivism\u201d by positioning Merton as a critic of positivism; hence, while appropriating \nMerton, Young leaves himself free of any positivist \u2018taint\u2019. He locates Merton\u2019s \nsupposed repudiation of positivism in his (Merton\u2019s) rejection of poverty as a causal \nexplanation for criminal behaviour, necessitating the subsequent introduction of \ncultural values (especially \u201ca commonly shared system of success symbols\u201d (1938: \n677)) as a crucial factor.  Thus, in Young\u2019s view, the essence of a \u2018positivist\u2019 account \nis its location of the causes for criminal behaviour in the structure of socio-economic \nconditions. By introducing \u2018culture\u2019 into the equation, positivism has been effectively \nset aside. However, such a rendition is, on reflection, not entirely convincing. The \n\u2018essence\u2019 of positivism does not reside in the favouring of socio-economic factors as \ncausal explananda, nor does the introduction of \u2018culture\u2019 into the explanatory equation \nmake an account anti-positivist. In fact, the heart of Merton\u2019s \u201csocial positivism\u201d (and \nby implication Young\u2019s) resides in the attempt to locate the objective causes of \nindividual behaviour. These causes can be located in a cultural system just as well as \na socio-economic one. What Merton\u2019s account does (in good positivist fashion) is \nreject poverty as a sufficient causal condition (since there is an empirically observable \ndisjunction between levels of poverty and levels of crime across societies), and \nintroduce a further necessary condition (a common system of cultural values \nemphasising individual success) that, in conjunction with poverty, furnishes the causal \nantecedents for crime2. At this juncture, it is worth recalling David Matza\u2019s (1964) \n                                                \n2\n On the one hand Merton (1936) sought to curb the more deterministic inclinations of positivist \nwell-known excursus on the \u2018Positive Delinquent\u2019. He points out that a positivism that \ncomplexifies its account by introducing multiple necessary causal conditions for a \ngiven behavioural outcome is not less positivist for that (just more unwieldy, \nqualified, and more localised in its explanatory ambit). Young, adopting Merton\u2019s \nthesis as his own, rephrases it thus: \u201cCrime occurs where there is cultural inclusion \nand structural exclusion\u201d (81: emphasis in the original). Hence it is in the conjunction \nof two necessary conditions (one cultural-systemic the other social-structural) that the \ncauses of crime are to be found \u2013 what could be more positivist than this?3   \n \nThe foregoing is not intended as a pillory, an attempt to discount Young\u2019s \nthesis by recourse to methodological \u2018name calling\u2019. Despite the many and various \nassaults on sociological positivism down the years (from Weberian \nVerstehendesoziologie, through phenomenology, to postmodernism), the viability of \nan explanatory social science has by no means been conclusively undermined. Indeed, \nthe very fact that this methodological dispute is on-going demonstrates the resilience \nand enduring appeal of a social science, however formulated, that could furnish an \n\u2018objective\u2019 account of social action framed in terms of \u2018structures\u2019 and \u2018causes\u2019. \nHence, for example, we have seen recent attempts to revive an \u2018objectivist\u2019 \n                                                                                                                                        \nsociology by emphasising the purposive character of social action. Yet, on the other, by subsuming \nsuch action under the coordinates provided by a systemic cultural configuration, he largely recuperated \nit within the ambit of positivist causation - hence the criticism that his anomic actor is overly \u2018socially-\ndetermined\u2019. For more on this see Matza 1964, 1969, and discussion in Sumner, 1994: 76-78.    \n3\n An analogous instance of the use of \u2018culture\u2019 and \u2018structure\u2019 in a positivist explanation for conduct is \nDurkheim\u2019s  (1970; orig. 1897) famous account of \u2018anomic suicide\u2019. Here, it is the combination of \ncultural factors (for example, normlessness, rising expectations) and rapid social-structural change that \nis used to furnish a causal explanation. Similarly, empirically evident differences in suicide rates \nbetween social groups (such as Catholics and Protestants) are attributed to differences in their cultural \naffiliations.  It is in their attachment to different systems of meaning that their differing propensities to \ntake their own lives are to be found. Here, culture is cause and suicide is effect. Subsequent critiques of \nDurkheim\u2019s account have stressed his location of causes for action in structural and cultural variables, \nrather than interpretively examining the understandings that the actors themselves might have of their \nsituation and actions (see, for example, Douglas, 1967 and Atkinson, 1978; also Hughes & Sharrock, \n1997: 30-40, on Durkheim\u2019s positivist methodology). The same point can be levelled at Merton\u2019s \nsubsumation of action to structural and cultural factors that are seen as the causal antecedents of the \naction. \nmethodological programme under the aegis of \u2018critical realism\u2019 (see, for example, \nSayer, 2000). It\u2019s worth noting that, in the formulation of Left Realism in the 1980s, \nYoung had already allied himself with an epistemology and ontology that views \nstructures as real, mind-independent features of the social world, which act causally to \ngenerate behavioural effects. What is interesting in the present context is that Young\u2019s \n\u2018realism\u2019 may be seen to dispose him favourably toward developing a criminological \naccount that favours causative explanation over interpretation, and which locates \ncriminogenic mechanisms in the structural and cultural situation of social actors4. In \nthis regard, Young\u2019s own revival of Merton\u2019s positivist inclination is somewhat at \nodds with his depiction of social positivism as an exhausted paradigm, one that is to \nbe located within the legislative aspirations of a now defunct \u2018modernity\u2019.  It may \nwell indicate the on-going relevance and centrality of positivist aspirations for \ncontemporary criminology, as it seeks to locate criminogenic mechanisms at the level \nof social formation.   \n \nInclusive Modernity? \n \nYoung\u2019s thesis is predicated upon a historical dualism between \u2018inclusive\u2019 and \n\u2018exclusive\u2019 society, paralleling Bauman\u2019s temporalised distinction between stable, \nhomogenising modernity (\u2018solid\u2019) and new destabilised, disordered and conflictual \norder (\u2018liquid\u2019) (cf. Bauman, 2000). Young draws a congruent socio-anthropological \ndistinction between modern, \u2018anthropophagic\u2019 society (that assimilates or consumes \ndifference) and late modern, \u2018anthropoemic\u2019 society (that ejects difference). This \ndesire to either assimilate (and thus eliminate) or exclude (and thus deny) difference \n                                                \n4\n On the connections between Young\u2019s Left Realism and earlier positivist criminology, see also Smart \n(1990) \nappears to be based on an ontological assumption about \u2018human nature\u2019: that there is a \npersistent will to closure, that the experience of the uncertain and the indeterminate \n(\u2018ambivalence\u2019 in Bauman\u2019s terms) provokes an effort to efface the problematic \nelement. As has been argued elsewhere, this dualism is reductive and empirically \nproblematic (Yar, 2002). A further problem is that to propose an argument that rests \non the concepts of \u2018modernity\u2019 and \u2018exclusion\u2019 requires a much more sustained \ndiscussion of both concepts.  We argue here that the picture of modernity presented \nsuffers from a common problem characterizing models of transition, that of drawing \nan overly homogenised portrait of the past, with a correspondingly overly \nhomogenised portrait of the present, with the differences between them emphasized \nbut the continuities omitted (Kumar, 1995).   \n \n \u2018Modernity\u2019 in Young\u2019s account is but a short historical moment, that of the \nKeynesian, corporatist, social-democratic society obtaining in some Western countries \nfrom roughly 1948 to the 1960s. Whilst drawing upon a particular understanding of \nmodernity (see below), what is developed is not a historically detailed argument of \nprocesses of modernization (such as rationalization, detraditionalisation and \ndifferentitiation), nor of the ambivalent and contradictory dynamics of modernity (see \nPenna, et al, 1999).  Rather, the immediate post-war years are given ontological status \nas an inclusive social formation.  This is a highly problematic rendition.  It is \nempirically suspect, tending to over-emphasise \u2018inclusivity\u2019 of past social and \npolitical regimes by deriving its empirical picture from juridical-political theory and \ndiscourse and assuming that the Marshallian analysis of social citizenship accurately \ncaptures the reality of the socio-economic and political regimes of those years. Such \nan account can only be sustained by ignoring other investigations that suggest a \npersistence of systematic mechanisms and patterns of selective social exclusion, from \nthe inceptions of centralised responses to the \u2018social problem\u2019 (in late Georgian \nEngland), continuing throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. It is not clear that there \nonce was \u2018an inclusive society\u2019 (despite political voices on the centre-left advocating \nredistributivist welfarism and the expansion of social citizenship), and that this has \ngiven way to its antithesis. In our view, this position can be more usefully understood \nas a dominant narrative of modernity, encompassing a particular discourse of \ninclusion and exclusion that has been fiercely challenged from other perspectives. \nYoung\u2019s account contains many features of what O\u2019Brien and Penna (1996) \ndescribe as an historical narrative of modernity, where modernising processes are seen \nto occur across several areas of social life at more or less the same time.  Here, \ncitizenship, or inclusion, is held to be a consequence of modernity, or, more \naccurately, modernisation. For Young, the replacement of inclusionary by \nexclusionary processes marks a transition to a late modern, post-Fordist or possibly \npost-modern society.  The \u2018late\u2019 or \u2018post\u2019 prefix has become a shorthand for an \nextensive series of debates about how to understand social change, dealing with \nconcepts of structure and agency, history, culture, subjectivity, public and private, \nidentity, ethics and science.  There is little consensus over how to interprete historical \nprocesses and, consequently, there are several distinct theoretical ways in which the \nquestion of 'the modern' can be posed.  A common approach is to situate the \ndevelopment of social protection systems (welfare and criminal justice policies and \nsystems) in historical processes of class conflict, nation-building, industrialisation and \npolitical democratization, and it is this approach that underpins Marshall's (1950) \naccount of the growth of social citizenship, a dominant narrative of citizenship that \ninforms much mainstream work (see for example, Riley, 1992, p188; see also Crook \net al, 1992, pp118-119).  This narrative derives from the \u2018modernity thesis\u2019, in which \nthe emergence and organisation of social protection systems is situated in relation to \nwider processes of socio-political development.  The modernity thesis proposes that, \nunderlying all the observable differences in experiences, beliefs, cultural \ninterpretations and social goals, there persists a unity or direction to human history as \na whole: modernity universalises processes of differentiation, detraditionalisation and \nrationalisation (c.f., O\u2019Brien and Penna, 1996; 1998).   \nThis perspective depends importantly upon the institutionalisation of particular \nworld-views associated with the eighteenth century enlightenment that underpinned \nEuropean modernization.  Consisting in the development of scientific and secular-\nrational systems of analysis, philosophy and theory, the enlightenment held out the \npromise of an endless era of material progress and prosperity.  It saw the emergence \nof systematic political philosophies - such as liberalism, communism and socialism - \nconcerned with freedom and justice and the conditions for their realisation. What \nthese philosophies have in common is a conception of universal human constituencies \n- the 'rights of man', the proletariat, or rational individualism.  They propose a concept \nof universal subjectivity, of universal categories of identity - such as citizen, nation or \nclass - which establish the foundations of membership, entitlement and rights within a \npolitical community.   The historical narrative of modernisation leads to struggles for \nmodern citizenship (inclusion) being represented as unfolding conflicts around \nprinciples of universal assimilation and (primarily) class identities (O\u2019Brien and \nPenna, 1996: 186-7). \nThe post-war welfare state is usually attributed with a goal of tackling the \nunequal outcomes of market capitalism.  However, in Britain, only some inequalities \nand impoverishments were attacked by Beveridge's proposals and subsequent British \nwelfare policy, leaving \u2018\u2026 Racism and Sexism, and the fights against them, behind \nstatues to the Nation and the White Family.'  (Williams, 1989:162).  As Williams, \namongst others, pointed out, the gendered and \u2018racialised\u2019 political outlines of \nBeveridge's scheme were sharply criticised when the proposals were published and \nhave been the source of dispute and struggle ever since.  The inequalities upon which \nthe post-war welfare states and Keynesian political-economies were built were not \npeculiar to Britain; Ginsberg (1992) details similar processes in Sweden, and Esping-\nAndersen (1990) has detailed the differential stratification effects of different \u2018welfare \nregimes\u2019.  However, it is not only gender and ethnic inequalities that underpinned \npost-war social organisation.  Modernity has been characterised by widespread \ninstitutionalisation \u2013 of people with learning disabilities, physical disabilities, \nunmarried mothers, people with mental health problems, orphans and disturbed \nchildren, for example.  The processes of modernisation, from the 1834 Poor Law \nAmendment Act in Britain, began with the building of workhouses and gradually \nextended to asylums, prisons, and residential facilities, seeing the segregation and \nincarceration of innumerable people. Recognition of this process of \ninstitutionalisation leads to two important implications for interpreting relationships \nbetween modernity and exclusion, one theoretical and one empirical.  \n Theoretically, the inequalities characterizing \u2018high modernity\u2019 can be \nunderstood not as the \u2018halted march of progress\u2019, or the outcome of impersonal forces \npropelling society into another evolutionary stage, but, rather, as an historically \nintrinsic divisive pattern of social co-ordination whose continued existence is rooted \nin and dependent upon modernity\u2019s processes of exclusion and marginalisation.  A \nnumber of important developments over the past three decades have contributed to a \nsustained theoretical and empirical challenge to the historical narrative of modernity.  \nThe new social movements that Young mentions, that include feminist, anti-racist, \ndisability, ecology, and gay and lesbian movements, forced onto the political agenda \nthe social and cultural differences through which social and political policy \nprogrammes were structured and experienced and, furthermore, focused attention on \nthe exclusionary processes upon which the centralised state social protection system \nhad been constructed.  O\u2019Brien and Penna (1998) discuss how, under the impact of \nnew social movements and the \u2018cultural turn\u2019 in social theory, the debate about \ncitizenship and inclusion was re-orientated to questions of social, political and cultural \ndifferences in status, identity, personal and social autonomy as well as questions of \nopportunities, rights and needs.  Such movements opened up the way to a 're-\nvisioning' of the political sphere and to the development of academic perspectives on \nthe cultural and political processes through which asymmetrical differences in the \norganisation of social life are sustained.   \nThis revisioning detailed an intricate web of connections between the political \nand cultural construction of the inequalities that tie together people's experiences of \nclass, race and gender, for example, with economic and social structures of wealth, \naccess and opportunity.  Analytically, a significant amount of literature from different \ndisciplines, but influenced by post-structuralist deconstructions of dominant \nenlightenment narratives, charted the way in which \u2018modernity\u2019, both as an historical \nprocess and as a form of society, depended upon a twin movement of both inclusion \nand exclusion.  McClintock\u2019s (1995) account of the development of Western \ncapitalism, for example, details the way in which economic dynamics were embedded \nwithin pre-existing inequalities of ethnicity and gender, inequalities that were \nreproduced during the development of modern societies.  The onward march of \nprogress depended upon both racist and sexist ideologies and practices that comprised \na process of exclusion from many aspects of social life. Modernity, here, comprises a \nprocess whereby the construction of the rights, identifications and symbols of \npowerful constituencies serves to de-construct the rights, identifications and symbols \nof less powerful others (O\u2019Brien and Penna, 1996).  This process of deconstruction-\nreconstruction can be understood as the primary vehicle through which the \nachievement and loss of statuses, opportunities and authorisations - citizenship - is \norchestrated.  Citizenship does not, then, form a unified, singular development of \nhuman society but a cultural and political vehicle for organising hierarchical and \nexclusive systems of representation and social participation.   \n \nWhat is notable in these alternative accounts of modernity is a refusal to take \nmodern visions of progress, inclusion and identity at face value.  Dominant narratives \nof modernity tell its story through the voices of particular (powerful) constituents, so \nthat subtle and persistent divisions in cultural status and power permeate the \ndefinitions and voices that record modern experiences.  Much of the literature \nchallenging the dominant narrative represents a \u2018politics of voice\u2019 (O\u2019Brien and \nPenna, 1998a): it is engaged in a fundamental reconceptualisation of the categories of \nsocial and political analysis so that different voices and definitions can be connected \nto their historical contexts and inserted into larger political processes and systems.  \n\u2018Difference\u2019 here does not simply refer to diversity - it refers to socially produced \nasymmetries between cultural spheres and their political location in hierarchies of \ndomination and resistance (Mohanty, cited in O\u2019Brien and Penna,1996:192).  Socio-\ncultural 'difference', represents a position in a complex matrix of political relations \nthat fracture modern categories of inclusion. \nSuch an analysis draws attention to the everyday world where the lived \nexperience of rights, duties, identities, and social and cultural boundaries are \nencountered and ordered.  The administrative procedures that arrange democratic \ncitizenship and \u2018inclusion\u2019 obscure exclusionary processes that such procedures in \nfact organise (O\u2019Brien and Penna, 1996).  For example, the supposedly inclusive \nperiod of high modernity saw the relentless segregation of people with learning \ndisabilities in large psychiatric hospitals, of children with physical disabilities in large \n\u2018special\u2019 residential institutions, the medicalisation and criminalisation of \nhomosexuality, widespread signs on lodging houses and rented accommodation \ndeclaring \u2018no blacks\u2019 and \u2018no Irish\u2019, stringent immigration controls on people from \nthe ex-colonies, amongst countless instances of exclusionary practices. This catalogue \nof widespread historical segregation, marginalisation and discrimination suggests that \nsocial exclusion can be understood as a historic product of modern democracies, \nwelfare states and their politically interlocking constituencies of gender, race, class \nand other social ascriptions. \nPatterns of exclusion, disadvantage and discrimination in modern social life \nhave complicated histories embedded in multiple socio-cultural connections.  \nHistorically, the expansion of citizenship rights has accompanied processes of nation \nbuilding, processes rooted in gendered, homophobic and racially bounded notions of \nsocial inclusion (see O\u2019Brien and Penna, 1996; 1998, and Hay, et al, 1999).  Europe\u2019s \ncolonial encounter is crucial in the development of categories of inclusion and \nexclusion, since both the formal public world of rights and entitlements and the \ninformal everyday world of experience draw on the legacy and persisting effects of \nthe modern European empires.  The ideologies underpinning colonialism established \nracist stereotypes of colonised peoples, and it is such constructions of ethnic (and \nother groups) that differentiate 'us' and 'them', such that the marginalisation of 'them' \nis the key to inclusion for 'us' in modern life.  These differentiations and distinctions, \ncentral to imperialist ideologies, are reproduced in the socio-cultural and geo-political \nstructures of modern, liberal, states.  Modern societies are shot through by numerous \npublic spheres making claims and counter-claims for different inclusions and \nexclusions - in the form of rights, entitlements and services (c.f., Fraser, 1994).  It is \nnot possible to achieve a final resolution to these issues of inclusion because the \nmodern polity is not a static, purely structural, forum in which inequalities and \nexclusions can be settled (O\u2019Brien and Penna, 1996).  \n \nThere is, though, a contemporary counter-process to segregation and exclusion \nthat, whilst still embedded in unequal socio-political structures, raises a further \nquestion for Young\u2019s analysis.  Whilst incarceration rates have increased in relation to \nprisons, paradoxically they have decreased for other social groups.  High modernity, \nfrom the 1960s onwards, has seen an increasing deinstitutionalisation process \noccurring for, in particular, people with learning disabilities, mental health problems, \nand \u2018looked-after\u2019 children, formerly incarcerated in huge institutions resembling \nprisons.  Oliver and Barnes (1998), examining exclusion and inclusion in relation to \ndisabled people, track a process that is described as a movement from exclusion to \ninclusion.  A similar processs of deinstitutionalisation can be observed in the field of \nchildren with problems (Triseliotis, 1997), and people with mental illnesses \n(Sheppard, 1997).  Such processes of deinstitutionalisation and decarceration are not \nnecessarily markers of something we might call \u2018inclusion\u2019 but, they do signify a \ncounter-trend to the increased segregation of people in prisons.   \n  These various observations pose a number of intellectual problems when \nconsidering the relationship(s) between modernity and exclusion.  Increased income \ninequality and prison incarceration rates in recent British history can be attributed to \nshifting political rationales and decisions and it seems unnecessary to attribute these \ntrends to impersonal forces of an abstract \u2018modernity\u2019.  If such an attribution is to be \nmade and sustained, some specification of the mechanisms of forces at work that are \nintrinsic to modernity (as opposed to neo-liberal policy decisions) is required.  If \nincreasing incarceration is a measure of exclusion, what are we to make of increasing \ndecarceration in other areas of social life?  Which process is more significant in terms \nof claims for an \u2018exclusive society\u2019?  On what criteria do we judge?  And, finally, as \nCharles Lemert (1999:191, italics in original) put it when discussing another account \nof modernity: \u2018If it turns out that there are real, incommensurable social differences \namong social groups, how shall we know what we know?\u2019. \n \nConclusion \n \nWe have suggested that Young\u2019s account is noteworthy as an attempt to negotiate \nbetween criminology\u2019s recognisable \u2018pasts\u2019 and its potential \u2018futures\u2019. This is \nundertaken through mediation between some \u2018traditional\u2019 criminological concerns, \ntheories and methods, and recent developments in the wider fields of social and \ncultural theory. However, we claim that it is precisely in this negotiation that the \ntensions and difficulties in Young\u2019s account emerge most clearly. Firstly, we have \nnoted a tension between the Left Realist orientation to localised and empirically \nfocused mappings of crime, and the attempt to situate crime causation within macro-\nlevel accounts of social, political and cultural transformation. These latter accounts \nmay be radically counter-intuitive vis-\u00e0-vis the \u2018common sense\u2019 perceptions of \u2018real \ncrime\u2019 forwarded by the subjects of Realist research, and may be at odds with \nRealism\u2019s emphasis upon \u2018relative deprivation\u2019 as a key explanatory resource. This \nresults in a stand off between micro and macro scales, between realist and reflexive \nepistemologies, and between the validation of \u2018lay\u2019, \u2018administrative\u2019, \u2018expert\u2019 and \n\u2018critical\u2019 renditions of \u2018the crime problem\u2019. Secondly, we have noted a congruent \ntension between the established positivist aspirations of criminological science and \nthe recent anti-positivist orientation of the \u2018cultural turn\u2019. The attempt to adopt a \npurportedly anti-positivist stance, while simultaneously holding fast to positivist \naspirations, results in considerable methodological confusion. Thirdly, we have noted \nhow Young\u2019s mobilisation of recent social-cultural theory has tended toward a rather \nreified and dualistic distinction between an \u2018inclusive\u2019 modernity and an \u2018exclusive\u2019 \nsocial formation that has supposedly supplanted it; this tendency is a flaw of many \nsuch social-theoretical accounts, which have tended to sacrifice historical specificity \nand complexity in favour of (theoretically and rhetorically powerful) generalisations \nabout \u2018modernity\u2019, \u2018post-modernity\u2019, \u2018late modernity\u2019 and the like. The result is an \noverly dramatised distinction that (while rhetorically anchoring the conjunction \nbetween \u2018crime\u2019, \u2018social exclusion\u2019 and \u2018late modernity\u2019) tends to attribute the social, \npolitical and cultural past with a false sense of unity. \n We would suggest that these dilemmas are not simply contingent or \naccidental (and thereby easily overcome), but are bound-up with the very attempt to \nmove criminology onto the ground of recent social and cultural theory, and to do so \nwhile retaining in considerable part the \u2018conventional\u2019 aspiration for an aetiological \n(indeed \u2018positive\u2019) criminological science. In other words, Young\u2019s book embodies \nmany of the challenges facing critical criminology (and critical and reflexive social \nscience more broadly) \u2013 viz. the choices between \u2018structure\u2019 and \u2018agency\u2019 (Archer, \n2000), between \u2018culture\u2019 and \u2018economy\u2019 as explanatory foci (Ray and Sayer, 1999), \nbetween explanatory \u2018legislation\u2019 and hermeneutic \u2018interpretation\u2019 as models for \nsocial inquiry (Bauman, 1987), and between \u2018reconstruction\u2019 and \u2018deconstruction\u2019 of \nthe discipline itself (Nelken et al, 1994; Cohen, 1998).  Insofar as Young\u2019s book falls \nshort of fulfilling its ambitions, this is due as much to the difficulty of the challenge as \nto any particular flaws in reasoning and research. As such, The Exclusive Society \ncommends attention for the ways in which it dramatises these choices, and the \ndifferent perils and pitfalls they inevitably entail.     \n \n Bibliography \nArcher, M.
