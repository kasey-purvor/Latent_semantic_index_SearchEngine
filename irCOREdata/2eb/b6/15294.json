However, to date, the structure of the scale has been a subject of \ndiscussion, making it difficult to compare results over different studies. In this study, using \nstudent as well as organization samples from two countries, we want to clarify the factor \nstructure of the RLS. In order to do so, we used a hypothetical factor matrix into which we \nrotated our data. Although this matrix fits some of the data quite well, the results argue for the \nuse of one core factor. The factor solutions are, however, still ambiguous and we therefore \nrecommend doing more research on a core factor of the Romance of Leadership scale.  \nKeywords: Leadership, Romance of Leadership, Culture, Organizational context \n \nRomance of Leadership  3 \nThe Romance of Leadership Scale \u2013 Cross-cultural testing and refinement \nLeadership is a complex matter that can be seen from several different perspectives. The focus \nof research has predominantly been on the leader and his \/ her behaviour or his \/ her traits. \nRecently, researchers have become more interested in the followers\u201f perspective of \nleadership. In this paper, we are focusing on an example of follower-centred research, namely, \nthe Romance of Leadership (e.g., Meindl, Ehrlich & Dukerich, 1985). In this approach, \nleadership is regarded from a social constructivist point of view (Meindl, 1998a) and is \ndefined as \u201can experience undergone by followers\u201c (Meindl, 1993, p.97). This means that \nindividuals are actively involved in constructing leadership rather than that leadership being \nsimply what a leader does. The Romance of Leadership approach predicts that in times of \ngood or poor company performance, people will attribute high levels responsibility to leaders \nthereby ignoring other possible influencing factors, such as the general economic situation. \nFor organizations, this romantic view of leaders can have negative consequences, for \nexample, if leaders are replaced in \u201cbad times\u201d without any change in the company \nperformance resulting there from (Meindl, 1990; 1993; to regard this in a broader context, \nimagine football or soccer coaches being replaced without the performance of the team \nimproving\n1\n).  \nTo assess this phenomenon, Meindl and Ehrlich (1988) established a measure of \nassessment for the Romance of Leadership. Since then, the instrument has been widely used \nin different contexts (experimental research with student samples versus field studies with \nemployees) and countries (e.g., the USA: Awamleh & Gardner, 1999; Germany: Felfe, 2005). \nHowever, in different studies, different factor structures emerged (e.g., Awamleh & Gardner, \n1999; Cho & Meindl, undated). The focus of our paper is, therefore, to analyze the factor \nstructure of the Romance of Leadership scale on both theoretical and empirical grounds and \nthen to examine this structure in different countries and different contexts.  \nTheoretical background of the Romance of Leadership approach \nRomance of Leadership  4 \nOriginally, Meindl et al. (1985) conceptualized Romance of Leadership as the general \ntendency to have a romantic view of leaders in so far as all responsibility for company \nperformance is attributed to its leaders. This process of attribution is due to sense-making in \norganisations, in other words the schemas we have to help us to simplify information \nprocessing with respect to what happens in organisations (e.g., Kroon, 2005, for a discussion \non implicit organisational theories in start-up firms): As company performance is complex to \nexplain, leadership can serve as a means of simplifying the cognitive processes involved in \nexplaining performance (see Meindl, 1990). Consequently, Romance of Leadership has its \ntheoretical basis in social constructivism (Meindl et al., 1985). Leadership has gained a \nprominent role in the explanation of company performance and one of Meindl\u201fs aims was \ntherefore to explain the reasons for this development (Meindl, 1990).  \nIn 1993, Meindl went from explaining Romance of Leadership as a general phenomenon \nto a more follower-focused approach. He claimed that emerging leadership is dependent upon \nfollowers. The idea that leadership only depends upon leaders\u201f behaviour is too narrow in his \nview. Rather, followers interact and socially construct leadership. Consequently, Meindl \n(1998a) refers to the Romance of Leadership approach as the construction and representation \nof followers\u201f thought systems. Leaders\u201f behaviour is then a \u201crough \u201eclue\u201f for the construction \nof leaders and leadership\u201d (Meindl, 1998a, p. 287). That means that followers\u201f reactions to \nleadership are more strongly shaped by their own construction than by the traits and \nbehaviours of a leader. Meindl (1998a) further claims that follower ratings of leaders are more \ninformative about followers than about leader characteristics and that the relationship between \nfollower ratings of leadership and their ratings of outcome variables reflect followers\u201f \n\u201cthought systems\u201d (p. 289) rather than a leader\u201fs impact. \nCritique of the Romance of Leadership approach \nBeing a follower-centred approach to leadership, the Romance of Leadership approach has \nbeen criticized for neglecting the leader in the process of leadership, or rather for not \nRomance of Leadership  5 \nrecognizing the effect of leadership on performance (Day & Lord, 1988). Ehrlich (1998) \nfound the approach too limited. He argues that the leader is needed in leadership research, for \nexample as a reference point, to make sure that the followers\u201f construction of leadership is \nabout their leaders and not their own personal approach to leadership. He also highlights the \nimportance of the leader in terms of the construction of leadership because different styles of \nleadership lead to different social constructions (p. 308).  \nSimilarly, Schneider (1998) emphasises that shared perceptions are really grounded in the \nattributes and behaviours of leaders. Without taking the leader into account, in his view, \u201cthe \nstimulus or basis of social construction\u201d (p. 311) is missing. He argues that followers \nexperience the same \u201csubstantive issues\u201d (p. 313) at work and, therefore, social construction \nwithout taking into account these circumstances is insufficient. In addition, Schneider (1998) \nmaintains that in organisations, people with similar personalities interact, and through this \ninteraction come to shared meanings.  \nTo summarize, Romance of Leadership has been criticized for not taking into account the \nleader and the situation in which followers act. Therefore, it has been regarded as too narrow \nan approach to leadership.  \nIn a response to this critique, Meindl (1998b) stresses that this approach focuses on \nprocesses not directly connected to actual leader behaviour and characteristics. He underlines \nthat Romance of Leadership is simply an alternative way of looking at leadership. Rather than \nnarrowing the view on leadership, he claims to broaden it. \nEmpirical evidence \nIn the following, we provide a short overview of studies on the Romance of Leadership. In \ntheir initial examination of the approach, Meindl et al. (1985) conducted several studies to \nshow the tendency to romanticize leadership in several areas of society. Analysing business \njournals, they found that leaders are often highlighted when their company is doing well. \nSetting Romance of Leadership in the context of nationwide economic tendencies, they found \nRomance of Leadership  6 \nthat dissertations, as well as business periodicals, focus more strongly on leaders when the \neconomy is doing badly (dissertations) or well (business periodicals)\n2\n. This implies that \nleaders are seen as having the ability to control and influence the fates of the organizations \nthey run, whereas other factors, such as the economic situation, are more or less neglected. \nIn 1987, Meindl and Ehrlich conducted two studies that showed the effect of attributions \nto leadership on outcome evaluations. When participants received an explanation for company \nperformance that referred to leadership (as opposed to employees, markets or government \npolicies) as being responsible for company performance, they evaluated the performance of \nthat company as more profitable and less risky. In a second study, Meindl and Ehrlich (1987) \nfound that participants rated stability, internality and controllability higher for the leader and \nemployee explanation of company success than those explanations related to markets or \ngovernment policies. In addition, in the leadership explanation, attributions of company \nperformance to the top management were higher than in the other conditions. Attributions to \nthe company\u201fs environment or to chance or luck were higher in the markets or the \ngovernment policies condition than when the participants received an explanation of company \nsuccess referring to leaders or employees. This means that participants differentiated between \ncompany internal and external factors in relation to their influence over companies\u201f \nperformance.  \nWith these two initial papers, one might say that the phenomenon of Romance of \nLeadership was proven. Research from here on mainly concentrated on the effects of \nRomance of Leadership rather than the phenomenon itself.  \nEhrlich, Meindl and Viellieu (1990) conducted a first study on the effect of Romance of \nLeadership on the perception of specific leadership styles. They examined the effect of \nRomance of Leadership on the perception of charisma and leader behaviour as assessed using \nthe LBDQ (Stogdill, 1963). Although they did not find any significant relationship between \nRomance of Leadership and charisma, Romance of Leadership and leader behaviour were \nRomance of Leadership  7 \nsignificantly related. In addition, Romance of Leadership and charisma overlapped in \nexplaining the perception of leader behaviour.  \nIn line with Meindl\u201fs (1990) assumption that leadership, especially charismatic leadership, \nis an \u201coutput of social psychological forces operating among followers, subordinates and \nobservers, rather than arising directly out of the interactions between follower and leaders\u201d (p. \n188), other researchers have focused on the effect of Romance of Leadership on the \nperception of actual leaders (Al-Dmour & Awamleh, 2002; Awamleh, 2003; Awamleh & \nGardner, 1999; Meindl, 1990; Schyns, Felfe & Blank, in review; Schyns & Sanders, 2004). \nThe aim of these studies was to examine the extent to which a follower\u201fs individual degree of \nRomance of Leadership impacts on the perception of transformational \/ charismatic \nleadership. Transformational \/ charismatic leadership was the focus of these studies, as \nMeindl (1990) claimed that transformational \/ charismatic leadership is itself a type of \u201chyper-\nromanticism\u201d (p. 182). The results of these studies are mixed. Some authors (Al-Dmour & \nAwamleh, 2002; Awamleh, 2003; Meindl, 1990) found a positive relationship between \nRomance of Leadership and the perception of transformational \/ charismatic leadership. \nShamir (1992) found that the attribution of influence to the leader, as well as general \nagreement on the importance of leadership, is positively related to the attribution of charisma \nto a leader. However, others could not confirm this relationship (Awamleh & Gardner, 1999; \nSchyns & Sanders, 2004). These mixed results may require more complex analyses. Haslam \net al. (2001) found that the attribution of company performance to a leader is not only \ndependent upon the type of company performance (crisis turnaround, stable profit, stable loss, \nor crisis decline) but also on the way leaders behave in terms of affirming or negating the \nidentity of the group they lead.  \nBligh, Kohles and Pillai (2005) conducted a study on the 2003 California recall election \nand how charismatic and effective the candidates (the present governor, the challenger from \nhis own party and an \u201coutside challenger\u201d from another party) were seen to be3. As a result of \nRomance of Leadership  8 \ntheir study, they go one step further than previous research, in that they enhance our \nknowledge of the conditions under which Romance of Leadership is related to the perception \nof charisma. Bligh et al. (2005) found that for the outside challenger Romance of Leadership \nwas indeed related to the perception of charisma, though this was not the case for the other \ncandidates. They found no relationship between Romance of Leadership and expected \neffectiveness. With respect to the interaction between Romance of Leadership and a perceived \ncrisis in California, they found that for the outside challenger there was indeed a higher \ncorrelation between Romance of Leadership and the perception of charisma amongst those \nparticipants who perceived California to be in a crisis. The opposite was true for the \nchallenger from party of the governor: for those participants who perceived California to be in \na crisis, the correlation between Romance of Leadership and the perception of charisma was \nnegative. \nThe Romance of Leadership Scale \nAs Meindl (1990) put it, the Romance of Leadership scale \u201cwas not intended to tap \nromanticizing directly, but focused instead on the extent to which leadership is likely to be \nprominent in actors\u201f implicit theories of organization\u201d (p. 168). Rather than assessing \nanything about a specific leader, it assesses a characteristic of the observer (Meindl, 1990). As \nEhrlich (1998) noted, the degree of Romance of Leadership differs within persons (over time) \nand between persons. Therefore, an assessment of Romance of Leadership is necessary to \nexamine the different degrees of Romance of Leadership and their possible impact on other \nvariables, such as the perception of leadership. To do so, Meindl and Ehrlich (1988; see also \nMeindl, 1998c) established the Romance of Leadership Scale (RLS). In order to develop a \nscale, Meindl and Ehrlich (1988) generated a pool of 70 items reflecting the idea of Romance \nof Leadership. These items were then reviewed with the result that twenty-eight items \nremained. These were administered to business students for rating and discussion. The result \nwas a set of 32 items. These were presented to a sample of 150 undergraduate business \nRomance of Leadership  9 \nstudents, yielding a one-factor solution. Two shorter versions (RLS-B with twenty-one items \nand RLS-C with 11 items) were established on the basis of factor loadings and item-total \ncorrelations.  \nThe resulting instrument consists of 32 statements on the influence of leaders in \norganizations all of which were formulated to represent extreme assertions. As mentioned \nabove, these items were supposed to reflect one factor (Meindl & Ehrlich, 1988). However, \nwhen factor analysing the Romance of Leadership scale, researchers often found solutions \nwith more than one general factor. In the following, we will give an overview of findings on \nthe Romance of Leadership scale. However, it is necessary to remember that none of the \nstudies reported here had the aim of clarifying the factor structure of the Romance of \nLeadership scale. Therefore, information on the factor solutions is often scarce.  \nAl-Dmour and Awamleh (2002) and Awameh (2003) found a one-factor solution (both \nwith one item deleted) for the 11-item version in a study of employees of Jordanian Public \nShareholding companies, Cho and Meindl (undated) found a three factor structure of the same \nversion. Their first factor was named \u201cDifferent effects for different leaders\u201d and comprised \nfive items. The two items loading highest are: \u201cWhen the top leaders are good, the \norganization does well; when the top leaders are bad, the organization does poorly\u201d and \n\u201cThere\u201fs no thing as critical to the \u201ebottom line\u201f performance of a company as the quality of \nits top-level leaders\u201d. The second factor \u201cAbsolute effects of leaders\u201d consists of four items. \n\u201cIt\u201fs probably a good thing to find something out about the quality of the top-level leader \nbefore investing in a firm\u201d and \u201cThe process by which the leaders are selected is extremely \nimportant\u201d are the two highest loading items. Their third factor was \u201cRelative effects of \nleaders\u201d, comprising only two items, namely \u201cMany times, it doesn\u201ft matter who is running \nthe show at the top, the fate of an organization is not in the hands of its leaders\u201d and \u201cIn \ncomparison to external forces such as the economy, government regulations, etc., a \ncompany\u201fs leaders can have only a small impact on a firm\u201fs performance\u201d. In their \nRomance of Leadership  10 \nexperimental study, Awamleh and Gardner (1999) employed the 11-item version of the RLS. \nThey found a three factor-solution again, but it differed from Cho and Meindl\u201fs solution. \nTheir first factor comprised four items. The two items loading highest on this factor are: \n\u201cThere is nothing as crucial to the bottom-line performance of a company as the quality of its \ntop-level leaders\u201d and \u201cWhen the top leaders are good, the organization does well; when the \ntop leaders are bad, the organization does poorly\u201d. The two items loading highest on the \nsecond factor (four items) are: \u201cSooner or later, bad leadership at the top will show up in \ndecreased organizational performance\u201d and \u201cThe great amount of time and energy devoted to \nchoosing a leader is justified, because of the important influence that person is likely to have\u201d. \nThe last factor consists of three items, such as \u201cThe process by which the leaders are selected \nis extremely important\u201d and \u201cIt\u201fs probably a good thing to find something out about the \nquality of the top-level leader before investing in a firm\u201d. Recently, Bligh, Kohles, and Pillai \n(2005) used the Romance of Leadership in the context of a study on the election in California. \nThey found a two-factor solution for the Romance of Leadership scale, with the reverse coded \nitems loading on a separate factor. Considering these mixed results, it would appear to be very \nuseful to establish a factor solution that is stable across different contexts.  \nIn a first endeavor to clarify the structure of the Romance of Leadership Scale, Schyns, \nMeindl and Croon (2004) constructed a hypothetical factor matrix on the basis of the content \nof the 32 items contained in the Romance of Leadership scale. They were able to differentiate \nthree factors. The first or core factor, referred to as \u201ethe influence of a leader\u201f, is the one that \nbest represents the theory. It contains items reflecting beliefs concerning the extent to which a \nleader is able to affect organizational outcomes. The second factor emphasizes the \ninterchangeability of leaders. Although the label given this second factor suggests that it is \nnothing more than the opposite of the first factor, some qualitative differences have to be \nhighlighted. It is true that the first factor focuses on one leader who is considered to be \ncompletely responsible for everything that happens in an organization, whereas the second \nRomance of Leadership  11 \nfactor emphasizes the exchangeability of leaders. However, it must be noted that the belief in \nthe exchangeability of a leader does not necessarily preclude the belief that the leader is still \nvery influential. The third factor concentrates on the significance of the influence of other \nfactors, in addition to leadership, that may impact on an organization\u201fs performance (see \nAppendix A for the grouping of the items).  \nIn order to examine the structure of the Romance of Leadership scale, Schyns et al. (2004) \ndrew three samples of German participants: a student sample (N = 146), a heterogeneous \norganisational sample (N = 104) and a homogeneous organizational sample (N = 202); for a \ndetailed description see Schyns et al., 2004. The results of their analyses showed that, \nalthough there were some differences in the number of items that could be grouped to the \nfactors, the three-factor solution continued to fit the data better than could be expected by \nchance. However, this prior research had focused only on the German translation (an \noverview of the results of prior studies using the Romance of Leadership scale is depicted in \nTable 1.). Further tests are needed to examine other language versions, especially the original \nEnglish instrument. In this study, we will apply the same hypothetical matrix to Dutch and US \ndata in order to examine further the extent to which these factors can be used for future \nresearch. \nMethod \nSamples and procedures \nThe Netherlands \nPrior to the collection of data, a Dutch and an American scientist made independent Dutch \ntranslations of the RLS. Minimal deviations were discussed with James R. Meindl, who \nfinally approved the translation\n4\n. \nOrganization sample (heterogeneous; sample 1). Students from a course on research methods \nreceived course credit for gathering the data for this sample from their acquaintances. The \nquestionnaire was constructed identically for all students \/ participants and contained several \nRomance of Leadership  12 \ninstruments on leadership. Only the data referring to Romance of Leadership are reported \nhere.  \n292 respondents from different companies filled in the questionnaire. 145 were male, 147 \nfemale. The mean age was 36.5 years (SD = 12.9). On average, the respondents had worked \nfor 9.4 (SD = 10.4) years in their company. 29.8 % of the participants have or had previously \nbeen working as a manager. \nOrganization sample (homogeneous; sample 2). The participants were personally approached \nin the workplace. After being asked if they wanted to take part in the research, the participants \nwere handed the questionnaire. The surveys were returned personally or sent back via mail. In \nthe questionnaire, participants were asked for demographic data concerning age, sex, \ndiscipline, and work experience before they were requested to fill in the rest of the \nquestionnaire.  \nThe 191 participants were employees of an accountancy agency in the Netherlands (54 % \naccountancy, 18 % support, 9 % tax advice, 7 % consultancy, 5 % other and 7 % didn\u201ft \nindicate their discipline). 47 % were men and 52 % were women (1% did not indicate their \ngender). The mean age was 34.3 (SD = 10.0). The mean years of work experience was 14.9 \n(SD = 10.4). 25 % of the participants had had work experience as a manager.  \nStudent sample (sample 3). The participants were asked during lectures whether or not they \nwanted to take part in the study. The questionnaire was handed to them and they were asked \nto give it back within two weeks. In the questionnaire, they were asked for demographic data \nconcerning age, sex, discipline, and work experience before they were requested to fill in the \nrest of the questionnaire. The questionnaires were returned personally or via internal mail (in \nthe case of psychology students, in exchange for course credits).  \nThe 145 participants were students of the following subjects: psychology students (84), \nhuman resource students (56), and students of other majors (5). Most of them (117) were \nwomen (22 men; 6 did not indicate their gender). The mean age was 21.3 (SD = 4.0). 97.8 % \nRomance of Leadership  13 \nof the students had had work experience in different lines of businesses (profit and non-\nprofit).  \nUSA \nStudent sample (sample 4). 364 US students filled in the questionnaire. 214 of the participants \nwere male; 149 were female. The mean age was 21.4 years (SD = 2.5). Students were \nmajoring in different subjects, namely, accounting (21.2 %), management science (20.9 %) \nmarketing (18.7 %), finance (14.6 %), business administration (12.9 %), human resources \nstudies\/ organizational behaviour (9.3 %), and others (2.5 %).  \nAnalysis \nTreatment of missing values \nThe samples contained few missing values. These were replaced by an estimate derived from \nan appropriate regression analysis of the variable in which the missing value occurred on the \nremaining items in the RLS. This regression imputation method was carried out by means of \nthe Missing Value Analysis procedure provided by SPSS 11.5. A randomly selected \nregression residual was added to the estimates of the missing values (see Schafer, 1997). \nFactor extraction and rotation \nIn order to examine the extent to which the data fit our hypothetical matrix, we determined a \nthree-factor principal axis solution for each sample. In all analyses, the number of common \nfactors was chosen on the basis of a Parallel Analysis, as described by Humphreys and \nMontanelli (1975). We then orthogonally rotated each principal factor solution into the \nhypothetical matrix so that maximal agreement occurred, meaning that the items load high on \nthe factor they are supposed to load on and zero on the other factors. We then tested the \ncongruence of the rotated factor matrix with the hypothetical matrix, using Tucker\u201fs factor \ncongruence coefficient (Korth & Tucker, 1976). In order to test the significance of our \nsolution, we rotated each factor solution into matrices that consisted of random permutations \nof the rows of the original hypothetical matrix and compared the congruence coefficients to \nRomance of Leadership  14 \nour solution. The probability level of the coefficient was determined under a normal \ndistribution with the mean and standard deviation of the simulated distribution. Although we \ncould have carried out confirmatory analyses, we decided to restrict ourselves to explanatory \nfactor analyses, as we were also interested in describing the differences between the factor \nsolutions obtained in the different subgroups. \nResults \nTesting the significance of the agreement of factors with the hypothetical factor solution \nTable 2 contains the results of the congruence tests. This table shows the observed congruence \ncoefficient along with its significance under the random permutation distribution for each \nfactor in each sample. For Samples 1, 2, and 3, the congruence coefficients for the first two \nfactors are significantly higher than would be expected by chance. In all three samples, the \ncongruence coefficient for the third factor does not reach significance. This means that in \nrelation to the data for the first two factors the hypothetical matrix fit is significantly better \nthan would be the case in a chance matrix. However, this is not true for the third factor. In the \nfourth sample, the congruence coefficients for all three factors are significantly higher than \nwould be expected by chance\n5\n. This means that, according to the overall agreement test, the \nsolution for the US students fits best. In the next section, we will take a closer look at the item \nstructure of the respective solutions.  \nTesting the agreement in factor structure \nThe rotated factor solutions for the four samples are given in Table 3. We also counted \nnumber of hits and false positives (Table 4). We defined the number of hits as the number of \nvariables with a high loading on the expected factor. The number of false positives is the \nnumber of variables with a high loading on the wrong factor. A high loading is a loading with \nan absolute value larger than 0.30. The last row of Table 4 contains the number of hits and \nfalse positives that would indicate perfect congruence with the hypothetical solution. \nRomance of Leadership  15 \nThe tables show that the agreement between observed and hypothetical factor loadings is \nhigh for the first factor. For the second factor, we find a significant number of false positives. \nWe find general poor levels of agreement for the third factor, except in sample 4.  \nWe preferred a global comparison of the four factor solutions with the hypothetical factor \nsolution to a more detailed item-wise investigation of the differences and similarities between \nthe factor solutions in the four samples. For the latter strategy the risk of capitalizing on \nchance fluctuations may be rather high. However, some differences can be highlighted. \nRegarding factor one, two items load especially high in all samples: item 24 (\u201cWhen the \ntop leaders are good, the organization does well; when the top leaders are bad, the \norganization does poorly\u201d) and item 25 (\u201cThere\u201fs nothing as critical to the \u201cbottom line\u201d \nperformance of a company as the quality of its top-level leaders\u201d). In addition, item 8 (\u201cHigh-\nversus low quality leadership has a bigger impact on a firm than a favorable versus \nunfavorable business environment\u201d) and item 20 (\u201cWhen a company is doing poorly, the first \nplace one should look to is its leaders\u201d) load especially high in the employee samples. A \ncloser look at items loading on the second factor shows that this factor could have been \ninterpreted somewhat differently in the four samples. Whereas in the first and second sample, \ninterchangeability and irrelevance are emphasized, in the third sample, this factor consists of \nitems referring to attributing no influence to leaders, as well as to denying that leaders deserve \nthe attention they get (leaders\u201f selection, salary and investment). In the fourth sample, in \naddition to items referring to interchangeability, items referring to leaders having little impact \nare included in this factor.  \nFor the third factor, similar interpretation differences apply: In the first and second \nsample, only one or two items load on the factor referring to lack of influence and chance \naspects. In the third sample, items reflecting a kind of resignation with respect to company \nperformance, as well as the aspect of chance, define the third factor. In the fourth sample, the \nRomance of Leadership  16 \nonly two items making up the third factor refer to the fact that no responsibility for company \nperformance should be attributed to leaders.  \nSummary and Discussion \nIn this paper, we examined the factor structure of the RLS in different countries and contexts. \nIn order to do so, we established a theoretical factor matrix into which the data was rotated. \nThe first factor can be described as the core factor, which fits the theory best and consists of \nitems that more or less stably show the highest factor loadings on this factor in three countries \nand with student as well as organization samples.  \nThe results for the Dutch and US samples were comparable to prior results obtained from \nGerman samples (Schyns et al., 2004). The first and second factors emerged almost as \nexpected. Our results therefore allow us to differentiate at least two factors (\u201cinfluence of a \nleader\u201d and \u201cinterchangeability of a leader\u201d) for purposes of future Romance of Leadership \nresearch. In organizational practice as well as research, the first factor will probably arouse \nthe most interest. If followers believe leaders in general to be \u201ealmighty\u201f, what they expect \nfrom their actual leader will be shaped by this belief. This could result in decreased effort on \nthe part of the followers, as they do not feel responsible for the company performance. On the \nother hand, the followers\u201f efforts might well increase to create a kind of self-fulfilling \nprophecy. Further research on the effects of romanticizing leaders is needed.  \nWith respect to the second factor, some interesting research questions emerge. We can try \nto imagine a situation in which, independent of how much responsibility employees attribute \nto a leader, employees believe that one leader is the same as the other. Strong feelings of \nloyalty between such followers and their present leader are not likely. Such a belief in the \ninterchangeability of leaders could also turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy, in the sense that \nleaders are more likely to change often in situations where they cannot rely on their followers \nto back them (here, think again of sport teams).  \nRomance of Leadership  17 \nAdditionally some differences emerged between the student and employee samples on \nfactor 1. This might hint at structural differences between employee and student samples, \nalthough further research is needed to confirm this result, before engaging in a stronger \ninterpretation of our findings. \nFuture research could focus on the relationship between the two main factors (\u201cinfluence \nof a leader\u201d and \u201cinterchangeability of a leader\u201d) We can assume that the relationship between \nthese factors will be different for different individuals and groups of followers. Four groups of \nfollowers might be differentiated depending on their values on the two factors: The first group \n(high influence\/high interchangeability) contains of people who assume that leaders assumed \nto have a high impact in the organisation. However, this impact is independent of a specific \nperson. Rather leaders in general have a high impact, maybe due to their position. We could \ncall this collective Romance of Leadership. The second group (high influence\/ low \ninterchangeability) could be called the \u201cclassical\u201d romanticizers: They attribute high \nresponsibility for company performance to a specific leader, in that sense that they assume \nthat this specific person makes a strong difference to the company he \/ she works in. We can \ncall this individualised Romance of Leadership. The third group (low influence\/high \ninterchangeability) does not show Romance of Leadership at all. They assume that leaders do \nnot impact on organisational performance and also that leaders are interchangeable. The \nfourth group (low influence\/low interchangeability) again does not show Romance of \nLeadership. However, this maybe due to a specific person, meaning that not all leaders lack \ninfluence but specific ones do. When differentiating between these groups, an interesting line \nof research would be to examine the different attitudes the group members have towards their \nactual leader. \nThe above considerations mean that both directions of the relationship between the two \nfactors make sense. However, it would be interesting to examine the nature of Romance of \nLeadership in organisations depending on the relationship between the two factors. We can \nRomance of Leadership  18 \nassume that followers who attribute a lot of responsibility to leaders but still think that one \nleader is like any other may show little loyalty to their current leader. On the other hand, \nfollowers who attribute a lot of responsibility to leaders may just as likely think that these \nleaders are unique and that they cannot be exchanged for one another. This could lead to \nfollowers placing importance on being able to work with a particular leader.  \nMore research is needed to extend the third factor (influence of other factors). In our \nstudy, it turned out to be the least stable factor. Nevertheless, it covers a theoretically \ninteresting aspect of leadership. Meindl and Ehrlich (1987) already examined the degree to \nwhich people attribute responsibility for company performance to other factors rather than \nleadership when stimulated to do so. The third factor contains ideas that tap into a certain \nidea, namely the attribution of company success to other factors besides leadership. Strictly \nspeaking, the attribution of responsibility to other factors than leadership may not be \nRomance of Leadership. However, when people explicitly deny the influence of other factors, \ntheir romanticisation of leaders is indeed strong. For future research, it would be useful to \nhave a better assessment of this aspect of Romance of Leadership.  \nIn addition, it could be interesting for future research on Romance of Leadership to give \npeople a choice between a range of factors that might explain company success, for example, \nleadership, the state of the economy or HR policies etc. Doing so could shed light on the \nquestion whether people attribute externally (in the sense of not feeling responsible for the \ncompany\u201fs success themselves but making other factors responsible) or to leaders in \nparticular.  \nAnother line of research should involve further examinations of the structure and \ncomparability of measurement of the Romance of Leadership Scale in other countries and \ncultures. Although, to date, a total of seven samples have been included in the testing for the \nfactor structure of the RLS, all three of the countries involved were western. For future \nresearch, samples from other countries should be drawn from countries that differ from those \nRomance of Leadership  19 \nconsidered here with respect to Hofstede\u201fs (2001) cultural dimensions. In addition to \nexpecting different degrees in the romanticizing of leaders, we can assume the structure of the \ninstrument to be different in, for example, high power-distance cultures. Interchangeability of \nleaders may be less prominent in these countries, given that they are individualistic as well. A \nstrong sense of hierarchy connected with emphasis on the individual can turn Romance of \nLeadership into having high expectations of one\u201fs actual leader. In high power distance, high \ncollectivist countries, however, interchangeability may be more strongly related to the \nattribution of responsibility, meaning that emphasis is put \u201eon the top\u201f, rather than on one \nspecific person. \nAlthough we did not test for cultural differences and could not do so given the nature of \nour samples (all from Western countries), we still found that the second factor comprises \nslightly different items in the samples. This may be hinting at different aspects included in \ninterchangeability, namely, that it contains romanticising leadership (no matter who it is, all \nleaders are highly influential on company performance) or imply a negative notion of leaders\u201f \nimpact (it makes no difference who is at the top, leaders have no influence). Only when \nhaving a close look at the different items that comprise this factor in different samples and in \nrelationship to the first factor can we really determine the degree of Romance of Leadership. \nFuture research could focus on uncovering the extent to which these different aspects of \ninterchangeability are culturally determined.  \n \nRomance of Leadership  20 \nReferences \nAl-Dmour, H. & Awamleh, R.

when \nthe top leaders are bad, the organization does poorly. \nx   \n25) There\u201fs no thing as critical to the \u201cbottom line\u201d performance of a \ncompany as the quality of its top-level leaders. \nx   \n28) Leadership qualities are among the most highly prized personal \ntraits I can think of. \nx   \n32) No expense should be spared when searching for and selecting a \nleader. \nx   \n3) Most things in an organization have very little to do with the \ndecisions and activities of its leaders. \n x  \n10) When faced with the same situation, even different top-level \nleaders would end up making the same decisions. \n x  \n11) Many times, it doesn\u201ft matter who is running the show at the top, \nthe fate of an organization is not in the hands of its leaders. \n x  \n13) You might as well toss a coin when trying to choose a leader.  x  \n17) The connection between leadership and overall company \nperformance is often a weak one. \n x  \n18) Many times, organizational leaders are nothing more than \nfigureheads like the King and Queen of England. \n x  \n22) So what if the organization is doing well; people who occupy the \ntop level leadership positions rarely deserve their high salaries. \n x  \n26) In many cases, candidates for a given leadership position are pretty  x  \nRomance of Leadership  33 \nItem 1 2 3 \nmuch interchangeable with one another. \n27) The President of the United States can do very little to shape the \ncourse of our country. \n x  \n31) One leader is as good or as bad as the next.  x  \n2) The majority of business failures and poor organizational \nperformances are due to factors that are beyond the control of even the \nbest leaders. \n  x \n7) Luck has a lot to do with whether or not business leaders are \nsuccessful in making their firms profitable. \n  x \n23) In comparison to external forces such as the economy, government \nregulations, etc., a company\u201fs leaders can have only a small impact on \na firm\u201fs performance. \n  x \n29) Leaders should not be held totally responsible for what happens to \na firm\u201fs performance. \n  x \n30) There are many factors influencing an organization\u201fs performance \nthat simply cannot be controlled by even the best of leaders. \n  x \nNote: 1 = the influence of a leader, 2 = the interchangeability of a leader, 3 = the significance \nof the influence of other factors;

Therefore, we \npreferred to use the term \u201ccompany\u201d throughout the questionnaire.  \n5\n Note however that although many congruence coefficients reach an acceptable \nsignificance level, the values they attain are not so high as to indicate perfect agreement with \nthe hypothetical factors. \n \n"}
