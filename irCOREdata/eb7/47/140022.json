The effect of non-ionic \nsolute water potentials and temperature was examined on in vitro mycelial growth rates \nand on expression of the TRI5 gene, involved in trichothecene biosynthesis, quantified \nby real time RT-PCR. This study showed optimal values of 25 \u00baC and -2.8 MPa (0.982 \naw) for growth. Marginal temperatures such as 15\u00baC and 30-35\u00baC, particularly in \ncombination with water potentials below -2.8 MPa, drastically reduced growth. The \ninduction of TRI5 was constant although some induction was observed between 20-\n30\u00baC, the most favourable temperatures for growth, depending on the water potential \nimposed, particularly at -7.0 MPa. A temporal kinetic experiment at 25\u00baC examined the \neffect of ionic solute stress on TRI5 gene expression and growth rate. The results \nindicated independence of growth rate and TRI5 expression, as the fungal biomass \nincreased with time while  the gene expression remained  constant. This suggested \nthat favourable conditions for growth will result in higher trichothecene production, and \nthat toxin production would always accompany the colonization process at a steady \nrate while the conditions for growth are permissive.  Quantification of key biosynthetic \ntoxin genes by real time RT-PCR was shown  to be a valuable tool to gain knowledge \nof the ecophysiological basis for trichothecene biosynthesis and enable better control \nstrategies to be developed during the life cycle of this important  mycotoxigenic \npathogen of cereals. \n \n \nInternational Journal of Food Microbiology, Volume 140, Issue 2-3 (2010) 169-174. \n \n \n3 \n \nKeywords: solute stress, temperature, TRI5 gene expression, ecology, growth, F. \ngraminearum, trichothecenes \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \n F. graminearum Schwabe (teleomorph: Gibberella zeae (Schw.) Petch) is a \nwidely distributed pathogen of cereal crops which causes important economic losses \nresulting in yield reduction, poor seedling germination and contamination of seed with  \ntoxins such as deoxinivalenol (DON), nivalenol (NIV) and zearalenone (ZEA) (Bai and \nShaner, 1994; Snijders, 1990; Tuite et al., 1990). DON and NIV are trichothecene B \nmycotoxins. Consumption of food contaminated by these compounds by human and \nanimals results in vomiting, alimentary hemorrhaging and dermatitis. These toxins are \npotent inhibitors of eukaryotic protein synthesis and induce apoptosis. ZEA has a high \nestrogenic activity. DON has also been associated with liver disease and esophageal \ncancer (Bennett and Klinch, 2003; Yazar and Omurtag, 2008). Because of the toxicity \nof these mycotoxins and their occurrence in cereals being close to the Tolerable Daily \nIntake values (TDI) they are is considered a health risk by Food Safety authorities (e.g. \nScience Committee on Food, 2000, 2002). Consequently, the European Union \ninstituted  legislation to protect the health of consumers and set limit values for DON, \nNIV and ZEA in unprocessed foods including cereals (EC 1881\/2006; EC1126\/2007). \nThe pathogen\u2019s life cycle is significantly influenced by environmental factors, \nespecially water availability and temperature (Munkvold, 2003; Sanch\u00eds and Magan, \n2004). Warm and rainy weather conditions at the flowering stage promotes infection of \nripening ears by Fusarium spp., resulting in Fusarium Head Blight (FHB), \npredominantly caused by F. graminearum, one of the main Fusarium species of the \nInternational Journal of Food Microbiology, Volume 140, Issue 2-3 (2010) 169-174. \n \n \n4 \n \ncomplex causing this disease in many regions of Europe and world wide. Several \nstudies have determined the optimum and marginal conditions for growth and for toxin \nproduction revealing differences in their boundaries (Hope and Magan, 2003; Hope et \nal., 2005; Jacobsen et al., 1993; Sanch\u00eds and Magan, 2004; Versonder et al., 1982). \nAlthough experimental conditions might have some influence on the results reported, \nintraspecific variability within F. graminearum might also have a strong impact since \ndifferent species have been  recently reported in  the Fusarium graminearum species \ncomplex (Starkey et al., 2007). In other toxin-producing Fusarium species, such as F. \nverticillioides, the differences between permissive conditions for growth and toxin \nproduction are pronounced (Jurado et al., 2008). \nPrevious studies have identified that the effect of water availability x \ntemperature effects on germination, growth and DON production are all influenced by \nboth ionic and non-ionic solutes (Hope et al., 2005; Magan and Lacey, 1984; Magan, \n1988). However, very few studies have tried to link this data at a fundamental level to \ngene expression of key regulatory genes (e.g. TRI5 gene). TRI5 is the key gene of the \ntrichothecene biosynthesis and encodes trichodiene synthase, which catalizes the first \nstep in the trichothecene biosynthetic pathway, the isomerization and cyclation of \nfarnesyl pyrophosphate to thrichodiene (Foroud and Eudes, 2009). Recent studies by \nJurado et al. (2008) demonstrated the impact that changes in solute and matric water \nstress have on both growth and FUM1 gene expression, the key gene of fumonisin \nbiosynthesis. This study showed for the first time that there was a significant \nstimulation of the FUM1 expression as ionic solute stress was imposed. This potential \nrelationship of ecophysiological factors with the expression of key biosynthetic genes \nhas not previously been explored for F. graminearum. \nInternational Journal of Food Microbiology, Volume 140, Issue 2-3 (2010) 169-174. \n \n \n5 \n \nA previous report has demonstrated a direct relationship between DON content \nand TRI5 expression (r2= 0.95) measured by RT-PCR (Doohan et al., 1999). However, \nthere are no studies which have examined the TRI5 gene expression in relation to \necophysiological factors. The quantification of TRI5 transcripts by real time RT-PCR \npermits a sensitive and specific approach to evaluate the effects of various abiotic and \nbiotic treatments on trichothecene biosynthesis. This allows a much more sensitive \nmethod for examining the influence of ecophysiological conditions than conventional \nanalyses of phenotypic mycotoxin production.  \nThe objectives of this study were to use real time RT-PCR with the TRI5 as the \ntarget gene to (i) compare the effects of interacting conditions of temperature and water \navailability (non-ionic solute potential stress) on growth and TRI5 gene expression and \n(ii) evaluate the temporal kinetics of the effect of ionic solute potential on growth and \nTRI5 gene expression.  \n \nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n \nFungal material \nA F. graminearum strain, FgB (L1-2\/2D), was used. This strain was originally \nisolated from a wheat field in Lebrija, Sevilla, Andaluc\u00eda, Spain, in April 2003. It belongs \nto lineage 7 (F. graminearum) (O\u2019Donnell et al., 2000; O\u2019Donnell et al., 2004). A \nprevious analysis to characterize the chemotype of this strain indicated that it was a \nDON-producing chemotype having TRI13 and TRI7 disrupted or deleted (Jurado et al., \n2006). The culture was maintained on potato dextrose agar medium (Scharlau Chemie, \nBarcelona, Spain) at 4\u00baC and stored as spore suspensions in 15% glycerol at -80\u00baC in \nthe Department of Genetics at UCM, Madrid, Spain. \nInternational Journal of Food Microbiology, Volume 140, Issue 2-3 (2010) 169-174. \n \n \n6 \n \n \nPrimer design and PCR amplification  \nTRI5 sequences from the main trichothecene-producing species of Fusarium \nassociated with cereals (F. graminearum: AY102605, AY102603 and AY102599; F. \npseudograminearum: AY102585 and AY102583; F. culmorum: AY102602 and \nAY102571; F. poae: AY130294; and F. sporotrichioides: AF364179) were obtained \nfrom Genbank (National Center for Biotechnology Information database) and they were \naligned by Clustal method using Dnastar (Lasergene, Madison, WI, USA). A primer pair \nwas designed using the Primer Express\u00ae software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, \nCA) for F. graminearum, F. culmorum and F. pseudograminearum on the basis of this \nDNA alignment. These primers were PQTRI5-MF (5\u2019 \nGATCTGATGACTACCCTCAATTCCTT 3\u2019) and PQTRI5-MF (5\u2019 \nGCCATAGAGAAGCCCCAACAC 3\u2019). The specificity of the PCR assay was assessed \nwith genomic DNA from a number of F. graminearum species complex strains (Starkey \net al., 2007) (NRRL 28585, F. austroamericanum; NRRL 28436, F. meridionale; NRRL \n29020, F. boothii; NRRL 29148, F. mesoamericanum; NRRL 26755, F. acacia-mearsii; \nNRRL 13818, F. asiaticum; NRRL 29169, F. graminearum; NRRL 29306, F. \ncortaderiae) and either closely related or not closely related Fusarium species (F. \nculmorum, Fcu2; F. sporotrichioides, ITEM 555; F.poae, MUCL 7555; F.equiseti, U6-1-\n1; F. proliferatum, FpMM12; F. verticillioides, FvMM12). All F. graminearum species \ncomplex strains amplified the expected 72 bp band, except F.cortaderiae. The closely \nrelated F. culmorum also showed an amplification band of the expected size. No \namplification product was observed with DNA from the other Fusarium species tested. \n(data not shown).  \nInternational Journal of Food Microbiology, Volume 140, Issue 2-3 (2010) 169-174. \n \n \n7 \n \nThe pair of primers used to amplify TUB2 gene (the endogenous control gene \nused in the real time RT-PCR described below to normalize the results) was designed \nusing the Primer Express\u00ae software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with TUB2 \nsequences from the F. graminearum strains available in Genbank (AY781313, \nAY781312, AY781311, AY781310 and AY781309). As described above we performed \nthe alignment of these sequences by the Clustal method using Dnastar (Lasergen, \nMadison, WI, USA). The primer pair designed for F. graminearum was TUB2PQ-PF (5\u2019 \nCCGAGGCCCAGTCCAACT 3\u2019) and TUB2PQ-PR (5\u2019 GGCGTCTTGGTATTGCTGGTA \n3\u2019). The specificity of the PCR assay was assessed with genomic DNA in a number of \nF. graminearum species complex strains (the same used above) and either closely \nrelated or not closely related Fusarium species (the same used above). An expected \nband of 59 bp was observed with all the Fusarium strains used (data not shown).  \nIn all cases, the amplification reactions were performed in volumes of 25 \u00b5L \ncontaining 100 ng of template DNA in 3 \u00b5L, 1.25 \u00b5L of each primer (20 \u00b5M), 0.2 \u00b5L of \nTaq DNA polymerase (5 U\/\u00b5L), 2.5 \u00b5L of 10XPCR buffer, 1 \u00b5L of MgCl2 (50 mM), and \n0.25 \u00b5L of dNTPs (100 mM) (Ecogen, Barcelona, Spain). PCR was performed in a \nthermocycler (Eppendorf Mastercycler Gradient, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). \nAmplification products were detected by electrophoresis on 2.5 % agarose ethidium \nbromide gels in 40 mM Tris-acetate and 1.0 mM EDTA 1X buffer. The amplification \nprotocol for both pairs of primers was: 1 cycle of 120 s at 94 \u00baC, 35 cycles of 35 s at 94 \n\u00baC (denaturation), 30 s at 64 \u00baC (annealing), 30 s at 72 \u00baC (extension), and 1 cycle of \n10 min at 72 \u00baC. \n \nGrowth in relation to osmotic potential (ionic and non-ionic potential) \nInternational Journal of Food Microbiology, Volume 140, Issue 2-3 (2010) 169-174. \n \n \n8 \n \nThe medium used in this study was a trichothecene-inducing solid agar medium \nGYEP (glucose-yeast extract-peptone), which contained malt extract (0.1%), peptone \n(0.1%) and glucose (0.5%). \nThe solute potential ( s) was modified either with the non-ionic solute glycerol to \nanalyze the effect of the water stress and temperature on growth rate and TRI5 gene \nexpression, or with the ionic solute sodium chloride (NaCl) to perform the kinetics \nstudy. The solute potentials used were -0.7, -2.8 and -7.0 MegaPascals (MPa) s, \ncorresponding to water activities (aw) of 0.995, 0.982 and 0.955, respectively. The \nsolutes were not added to the control medium (-0.7 MPa s = 0.995 aw). All the \ntreatments and replicate agar media were overlayed with sterile cellophane sheets \n(P400; Cannings, Ltd., Bristol, United Kingdom) before inoculation to facilitate removal \nof the fungal biomass for RNA extractions. \n \nInoculation, incubation and growth assessment \nA 3-mm-diameter agar disk from the margin of a 7-day-old growing colony of \nFgB grown at 25\u00baC was used to centrally inoculate each replicate and treatment. The \nplates were incubated at 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 \u00baC for 10 days on the GYEP medium \nmodified with glycerol. The experiment consisted of a fully replicated set of treatments \nwith at least three replicates per treatment. Experiments were repeated once. \nAssessment of growth was made daily during the 10-day incubation period. Two \ndiameters of the growing colonies were measured at right angles to each other until the \ncolony reached the edge of the plate. The radii of the colonies were plotted against \ntime, and a linear regression was applied to obtain the growth rate as the slope of the \nline. \nInternational Journal of Food Microbiology, Volume 140, Issue 2-3 (2010) 169-174. \n \n \n9 \n \nAn additional temporal experiment was carried out on the GEYP medium \nmodified with NaCl. This study was carried out at 25\u00baC for 3, 6, 9 and 12 days. Three \nindependent replicates were destructively sampled at each time point and analyzed. \n \nRNA isolation and cDNA synthesis \n The biomass was removed from the cellophane at the end of the incubation \nperiod, and the total RNA extracted using the \u201cTotal Quick RNA cells and tissues\u201d kit \n(Talent, Italy), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, and stored at -80\u00b0C. DNase \nI treatment was used to remove genomic DNA contamination from the samples using \n\u201cDNase I, amplification grade\u201d (Invitrogen; United Kingdom), following the \nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using the \u201cGeneAmp \nGold RNA PCR reagent kit\u201d (Applied Biosystems). Each 20 \u00b5L reaction mixture \ncontained 500 ng of total RNA, 0.5 \u00b5L of oligo(dT)16 (50 \u00b5M), 10 \u00b5L of 5X RT-PCR \nbuffer, 2 \u00b5L of MgCl2 (25 mM), 2 \u00b5Ll of deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) (10 mM), \n2 \u00b5L of dithiothreitol (100 mM), 0.5 \u00b5L (10 U) of RNase inhibitor (20 U\/\u00b5L), 0.3 \u00b5L (15 \nU) of MultiScribe reverse transcriptase (50 U\/\u00b5L), and sterile diethyl pyrocarbonate- \ntreated water up to the final volume. Synthesis of cDNA was performed in a \nMastercycler gradient thermal cycler (Eppendorf; Germany) according to the following \nprocedure. After a hybridization step of 10 min at 25\u00b0C, reverse transcription (RT) was \ncarried out for 12 min at 42\u00b0C. The cDNA samples were kept at -20\u00b0C. Samples \nincubated in the absence of reverse transcriptase were used as controls. \n \nReal time RT-PCR and quantitative analysis of the data \n Real time RT-PCR was used to amplify TRI5 and TUB2 cDNA from FgB using \nboth pairs of primers described above. Real time RT-PCRs were performed using an \nInternational Journal of Food Microbiology, Volume 140, Issue 2-3 (2010) 169-174. \n \n \n10 \n \nABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). The PCR thermal \ncycling conditions for both genes were as follows: an initial step at 95\u00b0C for 10 min and \n40 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 15 s and at 60\u00b0C for 1 min. SYBR green PCR master mix \n(Applied Biosystems) was used as the reaction mixture, with the addition of 2.6 \u00b5L of \nsterile Milli-Q water, 1.2 \u00b5L of each primer (5 \u00b5M), and 5 \u00b5L of template cDNA, in a final \nvolume of 20 \u00b5L. In all experiments, appropriate negative controls containing no \ntemplate were subjected to the same procedure to exclude or detect any possible \ncontamination or carryover. Each sample was amplified twice in every experiment. The \nresults were normalized using the TUB2 cDNA amplifications run on the same plate. \nThe TUB2 gene is an endogenous control that was used to normalize quantification of \nmRNA target for differences in the amount of total cDNA added to each reaction. In \nreal time RT-PCR analysis, quantification is based on the threshold cycle (CT), which is \ndefined as the first amplification cycle at which the fluorescence signal is greater than \nthe minimal detection level, indicating that PCR products become detectable. Relative \nquantitation is the analytic method of choice for this study (Gizinger, 2002). The PCR \nefficiencies of both genes were measured by performing a 10.fold serial dilution of \npositive control template to generate a standard curve, and by plotting the CT as a \nfunction of log10 of template. The slope in the standard curve for the amplification of the \nTUB2 gene was -3.22 while the slope in the standard curve for the amplification of \nTRI5 was -3.32. The efficiency of both pairs of primers was 104.26% and 99.71%, \nrespectively. Therefore, the PCR efficiencies to perform a real time RT-PCR \nexperiment have to be between 90 and 105%, and the slopes differences should be \u2264 \n0.1. In this method, a comparison within a sample is made with the gene of interest \n(TRI5) to that of the endogenous control gene (TUB2). Quantitation is relative to the \ncontrol gene by subtracting the CT of the control gene from the CT of the gene of \nInternational Journal of Food Microbiology, Volume 140, Issue 2-3 (2010) 169-174. \n \n \n11 \n \ninterest (CT). In graphic representations , we have used the average CT mean value of \nthe three replicates performed in each experiment, and this was subtracted by the \ncalibrator mean value of the three replicates to obtain the corresponding CT values. CT \nvalues were transformed to log2 (due to the doubling function of PCR) to generate the \nrelative expression levels. \n \nStatistical analysis of results \nThe linear regression of increase in radius against time (days) was used to \nobtain growth rates (mm\/day) as indicated above for each set of treatments. Analyses \nof variance were performed of the growth rates, TRI5 gene expression and temporal \nstudies including the data of the three replicates from each experiment. All sets of \nresults were evaluated by using StatGraphics Centurion XV.II (Statistical Graphics \nCorp., Herndon, VA). TRI5 gene expression data were transformed prior to analysis by \ny = log10 (TRI5 gene expression). \n \nRESULTS \n \nEffects of temperature and non-ionic solute stress on growth rate \n Figure 1 shows the  bi-dimensional map of relative growth rate of the FgB strain \nin response to  non-ionic solute potentials (between -0.7 and -9.8 MPa) and to \ntemperatures (15\u201335\u00baC). The fastest  growth  was observed at 25\u00baC and at -2.8 MPa \ns (9-10 mm\/day\n1), although growth rates were still high at 20\u00baC and 30\u00baC (7-8 and 6-7 \nmm\/day, respectively) at both -0.7 and -2.8 MPa s. Solute water potential of -7.0 MPa \nor lower, severely reduced growth rate, particularly at marginal temperatures of 15\u00baC or \n30-35\u00baC.

At higher temperatures (35\u00baC) significant differences were not found \nbetween water stress levels of -0.7 and -7.0 MPa  s, while at higher water stress \nlevels no significant differences were found between 15 and 35\u00baC and 20 and 25\u00baC \n(data not shown). \n \nEffects of temperature and non-ionic solute stress on TRI5 gene expression \nFigure 2 shows the relative TRI5 gene expression pattern of FgB strain cultured \nfor 10 days in response to both temperature and water potential. The ANOVA showed \nstatistically significant effects for both single factors considered in the study \n(temperature, solute potential), whereas their interaction was not statistically significant \n(Table 2). TRI5 gene expression was significantly different among the three solute \npotentials, showing different gene expression profiles. At 35\u00baC this was significantly \ndifferent. The best conditions for TRI5 gene expression were at -0.7 MPa s between \n20 and 30\u00baC (Figure 2a), and at -7.0 MPa between 20\u00baC and 35\u00baC (Figure 2c). At -2.8 \nMPa s TRI5 induction only occurred at 20 and 25\u00baC (Figure 2b). \nThe standard error of the mean values of the two amplifications performed for \neach sample in the same plate, were generally very low (about 0.1%) and never higher \nthan 1%, indicating a high reproducibility of the real time RT-PCR assay. \n \nEffect of ionic solute potential on temporal TRI5 gene expression \n Figure 3 shows the effect of ionic solute potential on relative growth rates, \nexpressed as the area of colonization and induction of TRI5 gene expression of FgB at \n25\u00baC after 3, 6, 9 and 12 days of cultivation. The results indicated that TRI5 mRNA \nInternational Journal of Food Microbiology, Volume 140, Issue 2-3 (2010) 169-174. \n \n \n13 \n \nsynthesis remained very constant over the whole time course of the experiment, \nregardless of the ionic stress imposed. \n \nDISCUSSION \n \n This study produced a detailed two dimensional map showing the optimum, \npermissive and marginal rates of growth of the F. graminearum strain analyzed in \nrelation to temperature and non-ionic solute stress. The permissive temperature \nconditions for growth were from 15-30\u00baC. However, growth was severely decreased at \n35\u00baC, although optimal conditions were restricted to 25\u00baC. Water potential posed a \nsevere restriction to growth at -7.0 MPa s. This suggests that strains from various \nparts of Europe and those from South America behave in a largely similar way under \nthese types of environmental stresses (Hope et al., 2005; Ramirez et al., 2006), and \nconfirms the importance and prevalence of F. gramineraum in warmer regions. This \ngrowth pattern could also explain the lower incidence of this species in large areas of \nSpain, which are affected by frequent drought periods and high temperatures. The \noccurrence of this species has been lately reported also in cooler regions (Central \nEurope), and this has been explained by the increasing temperatures registered in the \nlast few years (Waalwijk et al., 2003). \n The clear influence of environmental conditions on growth, which produced \nclear profiles for optimal, permissive and marginal conditions for growth, contrasted \nwith the profiles of TRI5 gene expression. In this case, TRI5 mRNA synthesis seemed \nto occur at a  constant rate within a wider range of conditions, with slightly higher \nvalues at between 20-30\u00baC, particularly under  higher water stress, and lower values at \n35\u00baC. These results suggest that trichothecene biosynthesis might occur within a wider \nInternational Journal of Food Microbiology, Volume 140, Issue 2-3 (2010) 169-174. \n \n \n14 \n \nrange of environmental conditions than those most favorable for successful \ncolonization. However, the low induction of TRI5 gene detected under  higher water \nstress (-7.0 Ma) supports the view that  induction of mycotoxin genes might respond to \nstress (Schmidt-Heydt et al. 2008). This aspect might gain importance in regions where \ndrought and mild temperatures are common, representing an additional risk for \ntrichothecene contamination. \nThe information available from the literature on DON production also indicates a \nwide range of permissive conditions for DON production and some variation regarding \nthe optimal conditions at between 25-30\u00baC and water potentials between -0.7 and -2.8 \nMPa (Hope et al., 2005; Llorens et al, 2004; Ram\u00edrez et al., 2006; Versonder et al., \n1982). On the other hand, in all these previous experiments, DON values were \nobtained after long incubation times (e.g. up to 40 days) and this might produce \nconsiderable variation among the studies. Over long incubation periods, physiological \nconditions might vary considerably among experiments affecting regulation of DON \nsynthesis. Furthermore, DON might undergo degradation, and intermediate \ncompounds might enter other related metabolic pathways resulting in variability in the \namount of DON detected at the end of the experiments. \n The study of the temporal kinetics of the effect of water stress on growth and \nTRI5 expression, at the most permissive temperature for growth (25\u00baC), indicated a \nconstant pattern of gene expression in all the ionic water stress conditions tested over \nthe 12 day period. These results contrast significantly with those obtained for the \nfumonisin-producing F. verticillioides. Although in this case an uncoupling between \ngrowth and the key fumonisin biosynthetic gene (FUM1) expression was also \nobserved, a marked induction of FUM1 expression was produced as water stress was \nimposed (Jurado et al., 2008). Overall, this suggests that favorable conditions for F. \nInternational Journal of Food Microbiology, Volume 140, Issue 2-3 (2010) 169-174. \n \n \n15 \n \ngraminearum to grow will result in higher trichothecene production, and that toxin \nproduction would always accompany the colonization process within a wide range of \nconditions, although the contribution to the total toxin amount produced at optimal and \npermissive conditions for growth will be higher than the rest. This is supported by the \nhigh correlation reported previously between DON production and fungal mass (DNA \namounts) in wheat samples (Fredlund et al., 2008; Schnerr et al., 2002; Waalwijk et al., \n2004).  \nThe different pattern observed for these two important Fusarium pathogens and \ntoxin producers, F. graminearum and F. verticillioides, indicates the importance of \nregulation and suggests differences in the ecophysiological role that toxins might play \nin the lifecycle of these two species during host colonization. Furthermore, this type of \ninformation is essential in the development of climate based risk models for \ndetermining the potential for contamination of cereal grain with this trichothecene \nmycotoxin and to decide the most efficient strategies to control both growth and toxin \nproduction. \n \nAcknowledments: This work was supported by the Spanish MCYT (AGL-2007-66416-\nC05-02), and UCM-GR58\/08-A (910672).
