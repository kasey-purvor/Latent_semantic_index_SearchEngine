Policymakers have placed \nparticular emphasis on breaking down the barriers between the professional groups involved in \ndelivering health care, and between the providers and users of health services. Both these sets of \nreforms\u2014the creation of multidisciplinary teams, and the involvement of service users such as \npatients and carers\u2014are seen as a means of improving collaboration, knowledge sharing and \naccountability in health care, reducing fragmentation in the way care is delivered, improving \nquality and ensuring that services are built around patients\u2018 needs and wishes. \nIncreasingly, service-user involvement in health care is itself expected to take a more \ncollaborative form, in order to overcome the power inequalities that are perpetuated when users \nare merely \u2017consulted\u2018 over service provision (Charles and DeMaio 1993). Service-user \ninvolvement is to take forms such as partnerships, which seek to emulate the equality of influence \nand close, cross-professional working of the multidisciplinary team. The literature on user \ninvolvement in health care and other fields of public services has documented mixed success in \nsuch efforts (Barnes et al. 2007, Harrison and Mort 1998, Martin 2008b). To date, however, it has \nThis is an electronic version of an article published in Sociology of Health & Illness 33(7): 1050-1065. \nThe definitive version is available at www.blackwell-synergy.com. \u00a9 2011 the authors \n2 \nnot drawn on organisational sociological writing on team work in seeking to illuminate and \nunderstand these successes and failures. \nIn this paper, we seek to utilise this rich literature to offer new insights into the practice of \nservice-user involvement. Using data from a study of five pilot projects in the British National \nHealth Service (NHS) where practitioners from various professions were brought together with \nusers to form management teams, we note how key factors identified by this literature facilitated \nor obstructed team integration and equality of influence. We extend these insights in relation to \nthe particular situation facing service users\u2014as \u2017outsiders\u2018 from beyond the professional norms \nand organisational customs of the health service. We also illustrate how the purpose of the \nteam\u2014as a means of reconciling the integration and specialisation of different roles\u2014created \nparticular challenges for service users, with important implications for how policy should \ndetermine the role of service-user involvement, cultivate its influence, and define its effectiveness. \nFirstly, however, we review the literatures on team work and service-user involvement in \nmore detail. \nCollaboration between and beyond professions \nAcross developed-world health services, collaboration at various levels has been advocated by \npolicymakers and academics for some time. In the NHS, policy has mandated collaborative \nnetworks between organisations at the macro level (Martin et al., 2009), integrated services at the \nmeso level (Glendinning 2003), and cross-professional teams including members from diverse \nbackgrounds at the micro level (Cott 1998). Micro-level multidisciplinary teams, integrating the \ncontributions of diverse professionals towards a common clinical or organisational aim, are \nclaimed to improve the quality of provision by offering more patient-centred services, organised \naround the needs of individuals rather than the boundaries of the professional or organisational \nsystem (Opie 1997). In particular, they are seen as a key means of reconciling two opposing \nimperatives in the delivery of health care: the need for integration and the need for specialisation in \nan increasingly fragmented division of labour (Donnellon 1996). Effective integration involves \nthe creation of interdependent relationships across professional boundaries, so that the diverse \nbodies of expertise held by different groups are shared effectively and deployed synergistically \n(Donnellon 1996, Dingwall 1980). \nConsequently, teams, partnerships and other forms of cross-professional working have \nbeen endorsed extensively in the policy literature. In the UK, the ability to work in teams is \ndeemed a crucial characteristic of the modern health professional (e.g. General Medical Council \n2006). Lack of team work is seen as a risk to patient safety, found by the Bristol Royal Infirmary \n(BRI) Inquiry (2001 p.276) to have created \u2015tribal barriers\u2016 which gave rise to protracted \ndeficiencies in paediatric heart surgery. Subsequent government policy has similarly emphasised \nthe centrality of multi-professional collaboration to NHS reforms. The NHS Next Stage Review \nnotes progress in instituting teams as key organisational units in the NHS\u2014\u2015Conversations about \nquality take placed in multi-disciplinary teams rather than in corridors\u2016\u2014but calls for further \nprogress: \u2015For patients, the team must go beyond individual organisations\u2014they expect everyone \nin the NHS [\u2026] to work together, to give them [\u2026] high quality, integrated care\u2016 (Secretary of \nState for Health 2008). \nTeams and other collaborative working practices, then, seem a solution to many of the \nchallenges facing health care, from efficiency to safety to patient experience. However, studies of \nteams in practice find a more mixed picture, with various empirical studies illustrating the \nproblems and challenges that accompany team work. This sociological literature highlights how \ncontradictory views about the nature and purposes of teams\u2014such that \u2015all groupings of \npractitioners can interpret the phenomena as in their best interests\u2016\u2014give rise to conflict as the \nteam is put into practice (Lotz and Kristensen 2009 p.9). From discourse-analytic perspectives, \nGriffiths (1997), Finn (2008) and Learmonth (2009) have highlighted how the term \u2017team work\u2018 \nacts as a \u2015loose rubric rather than a detailed template for action\u2016 (Griffiths 1997 p.60), which \nThis is an electronic version of an article published in Sociology of Health & Illness 33(7): 1050-1065. \nThe definitive version is available at www.blackwell-synergy.com. \u00a9 2011 the authors \n3 \nmay be constructed in very different ways in practice, and which therefore lends itself to strategic \naction by those who become \u2017team members\u2018. Finn (2008) finds that this results in a tendency \ntowards reproduction of dominant power relationships, such that the potential for greater \nopenness, knowledge exchange and learning\u2014and thus safer, more effective practice\u2014is \nnegated. Besides these discourse-analytic perspectives, various authors find that multidisciplinary \nworking frequently fails to mitigate boundaries between professions (Cott 1998, Opie 1997), \nespecially in relation to lower-status staff outside the clinical professions (Finn et al., 2010a). As a \nresult, teams and other micro-level collaborative organisational forms often tend to exacerbate \nthe fragmentation of professional groups, rather than facilitating their integration (Dingwall 1980, \nDonnellon 1996, Finn, 2008, Griffiths 1997), though local contexts can mitigate this (Finn et al., \n2010b, Mueller et al. 2000, Theberge 2008). \nSimilarly, rather than creating \u2017flatter\u2018, more egalitarian working practices, team working \noften reproduces existing hierarchies of power and control (Finn 2008). To displace control as a \nmeans of regulating working practices requires the development of trust (Das and Teng 2001, cf. \nDonnellon 1996 pp.18-19), as a means of dealing with uncertainty and ensuring that those \ninvolved in co-operative work behave appropriately. Trust\u2014in the sense of the \u2015expectations held \nby one party that another will behave reliably and predictably\u2016 (Tomlinson 2005 p.1172)\u2014can \ntake a number of forms (Das and Teng 2001, Newell and Swan 2000), which can substitute for \ncontrol in providing a basis for collaborative working. Trust may have various foundations, from \ninitial knowledge of the other party\u2018s reputation to the trust found in long-term reciprocal \nrelationships, but the more resilient and robust forms of trust take considerable time to develop \n(Ring and van de Ven 1994). Consequently, teams and other micro-level collaborative \norganisational forms frequently rely on more conventional, hierarchical mechanisms of control \nrather than on fragile and difficult-to-develop trust (Tomlinson 2005, Walker et al. 2007), though \nagain, there are exceptions to this rule (Finn et al., 2010b). \nPolicy on the involvement of service users in the management of public services has \ndeveloped alongside that on inter-professional collaboration, and, at least in part, with a view to \naddressing many of the same perceived deficiencies in public-service delivery, such as \neffectiveness and user-centredness (Abelson et al. 2003). In health care, from previous \nmarginality, the involvement of service users is now de rigueur in the NHS and many other \nsystems. Much of the policy and associated literature advocating multidisciplinary collaboration \nalso demands greater service-user involvement as a parallel means of improving health care (e.g. \nDepartment of Health 2003). Alongside its calls for a transformation of the \u2015tribal\u2016 culture of \nhealth professionalism, for example, the BRI Inquiry (2001 p.409) saw involvement as a key \nmeans of creating a safety culture within the NHS: \u2015involvement of patients and the public must \nbe embedded in the structures of the NHS and permeate all aspects of healthcare.\u2016 \nNot only are the aims of user involvement similar to those of policy around team work, but \nincreasingly, the forms it should take are the same. In the British context, the Next Stage Review \ndemands that the NHS locally \u2015forge a new partnership between professionals, patients and their \ncarers\u2016 (Secretary of State for Health 2008 p.20). Users are thus increasingly included in \ncollaborative forums and teams where knowledge is exchanged to improve services. Thus the \nconcept of the multidisciplinary team is being expanded to include patients and carers as well, as \nuser involvement comes to involve not just consultation, but partnership, with shared decision \nmaking, shared responsibility and some degree of equality of influence between professionals and \nusers (Chadderton 1995, Charles and DeMaio 1993, Rutter et al. 2004). \nGiven the challenges already noted of making functional, trusting teams out of different \nprofessional groups with diverse cultures, norms and interests, it is to be expected that similar \nproblems will arise when a group altogether foreign to health-service culture\u2014service users\u2014is \nadded to the mix. The literature on public participation and service-user involvement is largely \ncircumspect about the prospects for impact of users\u2018 views on public-service governance (Barnes \net al. 2007, Harrison and Mort 1998, Martin, 2008b). There are several recurrent themes in this \nThis is an electronic version of an article published in Sociology of Health & Illness 33(7): 1050-1065. \nThe definitive version is available at www.blackwell-synergy.com. \u00a9 2011 the authors \n4 \nliterature. The institutions that govern health-service professionals often act to deter them from \nengaging fully with users, encouraging professionals to construct users less as knowledgeable partners \nand more as lay patients (Martin 2008b, Barnes et al. 2007): despite the apparent elevation of users \nto the status of legitimate stakeholders in health-service governance, in practice their views often \nremain denigrated. Health-care professionals tend to be vested with control over the processes by \nwhich service users are consulted and how their input is used, and exercise this power in \nchoosing which aspects of service-user involvement to take up and which to quietly discard \n(Harrison and Mort 1998, Milewa et al. 1999). And the way in which user-involvement processes \nare set up often reinforces these divisions between staff and service users, with consultation often \npreferred over partnership, and a consequent arms-length relationship between service users and \nstaff (Martin 2008b). These features of public-participation and user-involvement processes are \napparent in approaches adopted worldwide, for example Canada\u2018s regional and community-level \nhealth organisations (Contandriopoulos 2004) and efforts in the United States to increase public \nparticipation in health policy and planning (Sleath and Rucker 2001). \nGiven these longstanding problems with user involvement, the task of effectively including \nusers in the multidisciplinary team seems highly challenging. Yet for all its challenges, the notion \nof expanding the team to include the user does at least offer the possibility of engendering a \nmore co-operative, less hierarchical relationship by promoting collaboration and parity between \nusers and professionals\u2014even if it does not always achieve this among staff. How far, then, \nmight the integration of users into teams which seek to foster collaboration and knowledge \nexchange achieve these aims? How can a grounding in the sociological literature on teams, \npreviously not applied to the study of user involvement, enrich our understanding of this \nprocess? Can the insights gained from this perspective offer any suggestions about how the \nchallenges in gaining influence for user involvement might be mitigated?  It is these questions of \nprocess (rather than the rather different question of the outcome of incorporating users into \nteams) that this paper addresses. \nSetting and methods \nThe empirical work on which this paper draws is a comparative study of seven pilot NHS cancer-\ngenetics services, each of which was mandated (and sought in different ways) to foster a \n\u2017partnership\u2018 with service users in the development and management of their projects. This was \nas part of a more general mandate to foster collaborative working between cancer specialists, \ngenetics specialists and other groups in the health service (such as primary-care doctors and \nnurses) to create more \u2017joined-up\u2018 cancer-genetics services that would better meet patients\u2018 needs \n(exactly who should be involved in any given team was left open to pilots to define). Service-user \ninvolvement, then, was part of a wider emphasis on collaboration, premised on the expectation \nthat more effective, joined-up and (above all) patient-centred services could be engendered by \ngreater collaborative working among stakeholders, including users. This idea was aligned with \nNHS policy on service-user involvement at the time, which made it a duty \u2015to involve and \nconsult patients and members of the public not just when a major change is proposed, but in the \nongoing planning of services\u2016 (Department of Health 2003 p.1). \nThese three-year pilots were co-funded by the charity Macmillan Cancer Support and the \nDoH. Mirroring academic definitions (Chadderton 1995, Charles and DeMaio 1993), they were \nto involve \u2015partnership working,\u2016 defined by Macmillan as \n\u2015where patients, carers and health professionals work collaboratively to bring about \ntangible service improvements.\u2016 (Macmillan 2005 p.4) \nTwo of the seven pilots set up separate service-user forums in response to this brief.  The other \nfive included users in their regular multi-disciplinary team, project-management and\/or steering-\ngroup meetings, and it is on these five pilots\u2014where, explicitly or implicitly, users were \nincorporated into wider professional and managerial teams\u2014that our paper focuses. \nThis is an electronic version of an article published in Sociology of Health & Illness 33(7): 1050-1065. \nThe definitive version is available at www.blackwell-synergy.com. \u00a9 2011 the authors \n5 \nThe research reported here was conducted as part of a wider evaluation of pilot NHS \ngenetics services.1 It took a case-study based approach, designed to facilitate comparison of how \nthe contrasting contexts and approaches of sites involved gave rise to different processes and \noutcomes (cf. Eisenhardt 1989), and used a range of qualitative methods. Fieldwork involved in-\ndepth interviews with 12 involved users (seven interviewed twice), 32 pilot staff (physicians, \nnurses, genetic counsellors and managers) and five officials from Macmillan, and observational \nwork at 21 site-level meetings (around 35 hours) involving users and professionals (plus 19 \nnational-level meetings, which are not reported in this paper) (see table 1). Interviews lasted \nbetween 40 minutes and three-and-a-half hours, and were audio-recorded and fully transcribed. \nThey included questions about various aspects of the user-involvement process, including \nrationale for involvement, focus of involvement, and how users were influencing the projects. \nObservational work focused on the interactions between service users and other individuals \npresent at meetings, with attention paid to how both formal structures of the meetings (e.g. \nagenda items) and informal processes (e.g. behaviour of staff and users) contributed to how users \nwere, and were not, involved. Together, the interview and observational data provided \ncomplementary understandings of the way in which service users and staff felt user involvement \nshould operate, and the extent to which this was reflected in practice. \nAnalysis took a form which sought to combine the merits of locating meaning inductively \nin the data, while being informed by key issues (sensitising concepts) known to be important \nfrom the relevant literatures. GPM led the analysis, reading each data source several times, then \n(with the assistance of NVivo) generating codes iteratively, guided by both issues identified in the \nuser-involvement literature, and features of the data that became apparent more inductively. \nThese were then grouped into categories that cut across the data, rather than being limited to \nindividual data sources, which were analysed further. Subsequently, we reconsidered these \nanalytical themes and the data they contained in the light of the sociological literature on team \nwork specifically, which was not specifically drawn on ahead of the original analysis. The findings \npresented below draw on this process, in which the data and their original analysis were revisited \nand reconsidered in terms of the somewhat different perspective afforded by the team-work \nliterature. \nFindings \nFindings are presented in two subsections. First, we cover the way in which user involvement was \nput into practice in teams in four of the five sites (\u2017Anyton\u2018, \u2017Beeville\u2018, \u2017Curevale\u2018 and \u2017Dovering\u2018). \nVarious macro-level issues across sites impeded the development of an equitable team in which \nall parties felt valued, and in these four sites, these were exacerbated by micro-level factors.

Then, we \ncontrast this situation with the way in which involvement was developed in the fifth site \n(\u2017Excepton\u2018). This illustrates how micro-level differences of context and approach seemed crucial \nin determining how far the ideals of a collaborative team that included users were realised\u2014but \nthis integration in Excepton brought with it challenges to the distinctiveness of users\u2018 contribution. \nThe predominant situation: collaboration frustrated \nThe situation in four of the sites, then, was one in which users felt they were not effectively \nincorporated into the wider professional teams running their pilots; frequently staff too \nacknowledged that they had fallen short of the equitable partnership they had been asked to \ncreate. This could be understood in terms of both macro-level aspects of the pilot programme \nand wider policy context which affected all five sites, and micro-level organisational set-ups in \nthese four which made it difficult for staff and users to interact and develop trust which might \nmitigate these challenges. \nMacro-level factors. The pilot sites were exhorted by the DoH and Macmillan as sponsors to ensure \nthat service-user involvement was central to their work. However, while Macmillan offered \noverviews, such as that quoted on page 4, of what involvement should entail, the sponsors \nprovided little specification of how to involve users in their work in a collaborative way, and how \npilots\u2018 efforts at putting involvement into practice would be evaluated. The exact role for user \ninvolvement, and whose interests users were to represent, was never clearly defined. Pilot staff \nfrequently bemoaned the lack of guidance and direction from above about how to \u2017do \ninvolvement\u2018, and commented on the difficulties they found in integrating service users into the \nteam. Furthermore, this lack of specification of the means and aims of user involvement was in \nstark contrast to other aspects of their work. Measures of success such as patient throughput \nwere more actively performance managed, and would be much more important in securing \nongoing funding following the pilot period. Consequently, many staff acknowledged that the way \nin which they set up and pursued user involvement fell short of ideal, because of both competing \npressures and this uncertainty about the process and purpose of involvement: \n\u2015We were happy that we had a user representative and we ticked that box, which it \nshouldn\u2018t be at all, it should be an active, a really big part of the project.\u2016 (Nurse, \nDovering)2 \n\u2015[We\u2018ve done] very little. [...] I don\u2018t know how to involve them, I don\u2018t know what to ask \nthem to do and it\u2018s very difficult getting meetings between us. [The users] just come to the \nsteering-group meetings. But [one user] works, so she can\u2018t make them. [Another user] \ncomes. [\u2026] Which I think\u2018s very good of her when, really, she must wonder why she \ncomes. Because we\u2018re not making full use of her.\u2016 (Nurse 1, Beeville) \nThe result was the inclusion of one or two users in each site\u2018s team meetings, but often little \nmore than this. At the meetings we attended in these four sites, users were largely present but \nsilent, speaking only during agenda items devoted specifically to user involvement or in response \nto questions about specific issues. At one (three-hour) meeting in Dovering, for example, users \nwere silent for almost the entire meeting, save for one user commenting briefly on a development \nevent she had attended. Users\u2018 contribution to the breadth of strategic issues (of the sort that \nMacmillan and government guidance on the purpose of involvement highlighted) was thus very \nlimited. \nBesides specific ambiguity about the means and end of user involvement, wider forces \nseemed to orient staff inwards, towards their own professional preoccupations, rather than \noutwards, towards the kinds of contribution that users did occasionally make. As noted above, \nstaff responsible for pilots had a clear brief\u2014generate patient throughput to demonstrate clinical \neffectiveness and thus maximise likelihood of ongoing, post-pilot funding\u2014and this to a \n                                                 \n2 All primary data excerpts in this paper come from interviews with the parties quoted. \nThis is an electronic version of an article published in Sociology of Health & Illness 33(7): 1050-1065. \nThe definitive version is available at www.blackwell-synergy.com. \u00a9 2011 the authors \n7 \nsignificant extent had to govern their behaviour. The concerns of users were more diffuse. In \nAnyton, for example, a user described how she had attempted to persuade staff on her hospital-\nbased pilot of the need to carry out extensive educational work among primary-care clinicians, \nand evaluate the effectiveness of this training. She found, though, that her pleas fell largely on \ndeaf ears: \n\u2015I would have thought that one of the main points, apart from getting however many \nthousand through the \u2017sausage machine\u2018, was to raise awareness, really build a foundation \nof understanding within the health community, among district nurses, lead nurses. So I was \nexpecting\u2014I mean I\u2018ve obviously got it wrong\u2014but I was expecting it to be more getting \ninto [GP] surgeries, because that\u2018s what our lot need.\u2016 (User 1, Anyton) \nThe pilot lead in Anyton (a clinical geneticist), however, had a very different view of the purpose \nof the limited educational work included in the project: \n\u2015[User and I] have a fundamental disagreement about what the role of that teaching was. \n[\u2026] The project was set up with a programme of education to raise awareness about cancer \ngenetics, about risk assessment and about the service. So you could argue that we weren\u2018t \nreally teaching but advertising, but in a rather detailed way. I\u2018ve never gone back to get \nfeedback to say, \u2015Was that helpful? Would you like more in the future?\u2016 [User] feels that I \nreally should. I haven\u2018t had the time to do it; I didn\u2018t see that as a priority.\u2016 \nWhere the more vociferous users did start to make contributions to the teams in which they were \ninvolved, then, they often found their views disregarded: \n\u2015I don\u2018t think they really understood what we could have given them. Because I think they \nthink we are patients. [\u2026] It\u2018s just a strange concept to them, using users. Because I\u2018ve \nbeen used as a user for other things, and it just seems strange that they weren\u2018t using us as \nmuch as they could have done. I felt a bit of a token gesture.\u2016 (User 1, Curevale) \nThe roles of staff, then, were structured by the external priorities placed on pilots, and by their \nmore general positioning within the professional and organisational division of health-care \nlabour, resulting in teams that reproduced these wider structures, and embodied hierarchies that \nmarginalised users. \nMicro-level factors. The literature also notes that sometimes, the way in which teams are \noperationalised can mitigate these challenges, through, for example, nurturing the development \nof trust (Finn et al., 2010b, Mueller et al. 2000). In these four sites, however, the opposite seemed \ntrue: the local organisational context produced clear (social, spatial and temporal) boundaries \nbetween staff and users that compounded the factors noted above. The lack of clear roles for \nusers meant that in most sites, their recruitment was an expedient process, with anyone willing \nand available \u2017adopted\u2018 as a user. In contrast to the process of staff recruitment, users were not \njudged according to any formal criteria about their skills and competencies. Consequently, when \nusers sought to contribute to pilots, staff were cautious or even, according to some users, \nsuspicious, in the absence of any process by which to assess users\u2018 appropriateness to become \nteam members. \nThis absence of formal vetting at the start of the relationship was followed by a lack of \ninformal opportunities to foster the relationships of trust and reciprocity implied by partnership \nand team working. While staff employed on the pilots had frequent opportunities to interact with \none another in their day-to-day work, in most sites the main point at which they came into \ncontact with users was at steering- or project-group meetings, often as much as three months \napart. These meetings were formal affairs, governed by tight agenda and frequently involving not \nonly pilot staff and users, but also wider stakeholders, such as Macmillan representatives, or \nsenior managers from the primary care trust (PCT) or hospital. Consequently, users found \nthemselves trying to foster trusting relationships with staff at meetings where formality precluded \nthe building of much trust, and trying to argue for more expansive, wideranging remits at \nprecisely the points at which staff were most focused on narrow concerns of budget, throughput \nand sustainability. If there was an opportunity to build relationships that might open the minds of \nThis is an electronic version of an article published in Sociology of Health & Illness 33(7): 1050-1065. \nThe definitive version is available at www.blackwell-synergy.com. \u00a9 2011 the authors \n8 \nstaff to partnership\u2014and open the remits of projects to more wideranging ambitions\u2014this was \nnot it. \nIn these kinds of ways, institutional impediments to a more team-based form of \ninvolvement were reinforced by its pilot-level organisation, which bolstered the division between \nthose in the \u2017team\u2018\u2014staff\u2014and those who were outsiders\u2014the users (and other wider \nstakeholders, such as senior managers, who could generally, though, rely on positional power for \ninfluence). The team itself may not have been characterised by accord and mutuality, but it did at \nleast benefit from ongoing contact that enabled its members to get to know each other and build \na sense of commonality and purpose. The performance focus of staff did not encourage them to \nenter partnerships with individuals they hardly knew, who wished to influence pilots but would \nnot be held accountable for their success or failure, and whose contributions were out of kilter \nwith the main agenda of the meetings they attended. Thus the (micro-level) absence of the \nopportunity to develop the \u2017social\u2018 aspects of team working\u2014trust, reciprocity, a consistent \nworking relationship built through time\u2014combined with wider (macro-level) forces to preclude \nthe emergence of the \u2017functional\u2018 aspects of team working: shared decision-making processes \nwithin pilots. \nThe situation in Anyton exemplified these problems. Here, the user involved most regularly \nin the project recounted her growing disappointment at the fact that the \u2017team\u2018 she thought she \nhad joined was not as harmonious as it had first appeared. She described her realisation that even \namong the project\u2018s staff, there were professional hierarchies which she had not expected, as well \nas inter-personal fractures between some of the pilot\u2018s employees. She, meanwhile, found herself \non the margins even of this dysfunctional team, as an \u2017unknown quantity\u2018 to staff: \n\u2015Their idea of partnership I find quite disturbing, because you\u2018ve instantly got their \nhierarchies round the table, between themselves, let alone when the service user turns up. \nSo you\u2018ve got this consultant thing, and you get your senior nurses, and then you get some \nsort of also-ran, and some sort of administrative person, and then lower than that is this \nmember of the public that they\u2018ve had to tick a box to say they had. So I\u2018ve never felt that \nthey\u2018ve really come to grips with partnership within their own team, let alone with a \nmember of the public.\u2016 \nThrough time, the user found that the pilot\u2018s aims were defined by the lead\u2018s eagerness to secure \nas large a throughput of patients as possible. Her own efforts to broaden the remit of the project \nwere unsuccessful, and she felt that even insofar as a team existed, she was indubitably not part \nof it. \nIntriguingly, the Anyton pilot lead and the user deployed the same analogy to describe their \nexperiences of trying to gain legitimacy and influence in the project and in wider NHS cancer \nprovision, comparing it with their experiences of moving into small villages. Their accounts \ndiverged tellingly in the outcomes they describe: \n\u2015You make yourself available for talks and things, and you bump into people in the \ncorridor, and you develop a professional relationship where it\u2018s friendly. So now I can \nspeak to [breast surgeon] up at [neighbouring hospital] on a friendly basis, whereas before \nit was senior surgeon, junior consultant. [\u2026] So in some ways it\u2018s like moving into a small \nvillage and fitting in. And this is exactly what I\u2018ve done here.\u2016 (Lead) \n\u2015I\u2018ve lived in this village long enough to know that in a feudal village, you\u2018ve got a very \nstrange mix of folk, from very different backgrounds, and you can easily offend locals\u2014\nreal locals\u2014by being the incomer. [\u2026] You don\u2018t start making pronouncements about \nfarming or sheep prices round here! So really it\u2018s just having learnt to be circumspect.\u2016 \n(User 1) \nMaking friends, influencing people and becoming a \u2017local\u2018 in the NHS \u2017village\u2018, then, was a rather \ndifferent prospect for a consultant compared to a user. \nThe user acknowledged, though, that the suspicion she felt she had encountered from \nAnyton\u2018s staff was a natural reaction to the inclusion of an individual about whom they knew \nThis is an electronic version of an article published in Sociology of Health & Illness 33(7): 1050-1065. \nThe definitive version is available at www.blackwell-synergy.com. \u00a9 2011 the authors \n9 \nlittle, and with whom they had few opportunities to form interpersonal bonds or establish \ncommon ground. Eventually\u2014and through, by her account, dogged determination\u2014this user felt \nthat she did succeed in gaining a modicum of legitimacy among the staff, though long after \nAnyton\u2018s other user had given up, and only at the very end of the pilot period: \n\u2015There was a real move forward. I felt that there was trust. That was the word that I kept \non thinking. There was a lot of holding back\u2014I mean, I don\u2018t blame them. They don\u2018t \nknow who these service users are. They don\u2018t know how trustworthy they are. I mean they \nmight be off to the local paper, and spill all sorts of dreadful beans, mightn\u2018t they? So I felt \nthat in a way, they\u2018d been right to be cautious. And now they knew it was OK. So I felt that \nwe had a professional kind of relationship, come the end.\u2016 \nExcepton: partnership achieved \nIn four sites out of five, the situation described in relation to Anyton was the prevailing pattern, \nwith the local-level social, spatial and temporal organisation of pilots reinforcing wider obstacles \nthat precluded the development of teams that included users. In Excepton, however, things were \ndifferent. Users and staff alike saw their work as a genuine partnership, as did Macmillan staff: \n\u2015They\u2018re as much a part of that project as any of the health professionals working on it. It\u2018s \nabsolutely true partnership working. And I have to say, as a model it\u2018s absolutely \noutstanding, it\u2018s worked exceptionally well. The other projects haven\u2018t been quite as \nsuccessful in that respect.\u2016 (Macmillan officer) \nCertain differences between the set-up in Excepton and the other sites seemed to assist this \nachievement. For example, where recruitment elsewhere was characterised primarily by \nexpediency, in Excepton the two users were selected purposively by the lead nurse from her past \npatients on account of their personal characteristics and skills. From the start, then, the users here \nwere far less \u2017outsiders\u2018 than elsewhere. Spatial and temporal organisation consolidated this: \nproject-group meetings were frequent, with the core group of practitioners and users coming \ntogether once a month, and at times more frequently to deal with specific issues. It also seemed \nthat the relatively small size of the team and the frequency with which it met rendered it less \nhierarchically governed than in most other sites, and this meant it was well suited to integrating \nthe users. On an inter-personal level, it was clear that users and staff were both keen to form \nclose, informal bonds that might support their work together. Consequently, they seemed more \nfamiliar with one another even than the core staff in some sites: \n\u2015It\u2018s great, it really works out well because when we\u2018ve gone to London, we stayed over last \ntime, and we all went out, and there were no barriers at all. [\u2026] It\u2018s just such an easy \natmosphere, and you feel that you can totally participate, you don\u2018t feel you have to think, \n\u2017Ooh, should I be commenting like that?\u2018\u2016 (User 1) \nThat the purposive recruitment process had allowed staff to involve the \u2017right kind\u2018 of users, with \nappropriate attitudes and skills, was certainly crucial to this inter-personal openness and apparent \npartnership. The service manager commented on the importance of careful selection, to avoid \nrecruiting someone \u2015with a gripe because they\u2018ve had a raw deal in the service [and to ensure \nthat] it isn\u2018t a way of them sabotaging what you\u2018re wanting to do.\u2016 Similarly, the lead nurse \nstressed the importance of her prior familiarity with the users: \u2015I knew they would be on the \nsame wavelength as me, so that was going to make my life easier than somebody who\u2018s very \ndifficult.\u2016 This undoubtedly helped the flow of the project-group meetings, which were \ncharacterised by a consensual decision-making process and often-lengthy conversations about the \nmatters in hand, followed by apparent agreement across the team about the way forward. \nAn initial congruence of visions, then, was complemented by trust and a conscious effort \nto ensure that users were actively involved in meetings\u2014in direct contrast to the situation in \nAnyton and elsewhere. Through time, however, as the pilot moved from working out its purpose, \nremit and how to achieve these into a more settled phase of service delivery, the role for users \nbecame more constrained. The commitment of the staff to involving users remained\u2014indeed \nThis is an electronic version of an article published in Sociology of Health & Illness 33(7): 1050-1065. \nThe definitive version is available at www.blackwell-synergy.com. \u00a9 2011 the authors \n10 \nthey actively sought to recruit further users\u2014but the scope for users\u2018 involvement now seemed \nmore limited. With the remit of the project established through the consensus of the earlier \nproject-group meetings, the need now was for users to contribute what they could to its success. \nEffectively, then, users were to draw on their particular skills, alongside professional staff drawing \non theirs, to assist progress towards two agreed goals: maximum possible throughput and \nongoing funding. To these ends, the users contributed to publicity events for the pilot, and also \nattended meetings with commissioners alongside pilot staff to signal the commitment of the pilot \nto genuine user involvement, and demonstrate their own enthusiasm about its work. \nMidway through the pilot period, the users were granted \u2017volunteer status\u2018 by Excepton \nPCT, the pilot\u2018s host organisation. Apart from allowing them to make expenses claims, this \ndevelopment also represented an interesting formalisation of their roles and responsibilities: \n\u2015It\u2018s very much like when you\u2018re employed, there\u2018s a job description, and you have the \ndiscussion with your supervisor or whatever to make sure that you\u2018re not having to do \nthings you shouldn\u2018t be doing, that you\u2018re comfortable with what you\u2018re doing, and it looks \nat us from that point of view to make sure that we\u2018re handling things OK. It does the real \nsupervisor bit.\u2016 (User 1) \nThis contractual formality\u2014accompanied, as we have seen, by inter-personal informality in the \nrelationships between users and staff in Excepton\u2014reflected the increasingly professionalised \nrole that the users were performing. After receiving ongoing funding from the PCT, staff began \nworking to expand the service to cover neighbouring areas. The service\u2018s manager saw an \nimportant ongoing role for the users in this expansion process, giving more presentations in \nnearby towns to which the service was being extended. As the service manager explained, \nvolunteer status meant that users\u2018 contribution to this could now be recognised and rewarded: \n\u2015They\u2018ll get the travel expenses and the food and that sort of thing, but we also pay them \nsomething if they\u2018re speaking at the events. It\u2018s more of a talk, and it\u2018s not the full \nconsultancy rate or anything like that! But we try to say \u2017thank you\u2018 in some way. I must \nadmit, at one point it was as if they were full time like we were in the pilot, because they \nwere so committed.\u2016 \nThrough time, then, as Excepton\u2018s purpose and processes became settled, the role for \ninvolvement became more narrowly defined by the needs of the project, in terms of \nsustainability, throughput and expansion. From the start, these areas had been a crucial focus of \nthe input of users chosen in part for the complementarity of their skills. Attaining volunteer \nstatus, though, seemed to reflect an evolution whereby their skills became the defining \ncharacteristic of the users\u2018 roles. As a Macmillan officer commented, Excepton\u2018s users were \u2015not \nseen as users any longer: they\u2018re part of the team.\u2016 This innocuous observation, however, seemed \nto highlight a tension in the achievement of \u2017partnership\u2018 in Excepton, where an alignment of \ninterests and a social integration of involvement seemed somehow to precipitate the loss of the \ndistinctive identity and contribution of the users. The existence of the social and structural prerequisites \nfor team work interacted with the emergence, through time, of a stable model of service delivery \nto give rise to a significant professionalisation of the role, extending to a formalisation of remit (a \nquasi-job description) and the payment of honoraria. To this extent, the successful integration of \nusers in Excepton into a functional and non-hierarchical team seemed to threaten the \ndistinctiveness of the role of users in the pilot\u2018s management, as non-professional representatives \nof the service-user interest. \nDiscussion \nThe situation in four of the five sites in which user involvement was integrated into the pilots \nillustrates how many of the challenges which have been shown to impede the realisation of team \nwork across professions also apply to efforts to incorporate users into these teams. External \npressures, such as performance requirements, oriented staff away from collaboration with users \ntowards their own priorities; professional norms, values and culture seemed also to disincline \nThis is an electronic version of an article published in Sociology of Health & Illness 33(7): 1050-1065. \nThe definitive version is available at www.blackwell-synergy.com. \u00a9 2011 the authors \n11 \nstaff from including users in decision-making processes. The operationalisation of partnership in \nthese sites, then, tended towards conflict and fragmentation, rather than integration between \nusers and the various professional groups present, as found in much of the literature on team \nworking across professions (Dingwall 1980, Donnellon 1996, Finn, 2008, Griffiths 1997). \nMoreover, many issues identified by the sociological literature on team work were amplified in \nthese sites. Differences of status, culture and socialisation seemed even greater between health \nprofessionals and service users than between professions. Furthermore the local social, spatial \nand temporal organisation of the pilots precluded the opportunity to bridge these gaps. When the \nonly contact between users and the rest of the \u2017team\u2018 was formal, business-focused meetings, \noften several months apart, users found themselves unable to become trusted, familiar faces and \nvalued team members. Being embedded in the social field of the organisation would seem a vital \nprecondition for this. Thus even if, as the NHS Next Stage Review claims, key interactions and \ndecisions now take place \u2015in multi-disciplinary teams rather than in corridors\u2016 (Secretary of State \nfor Health 2008 p.48), being around those corridors is still crucial\u2014as emphasised by the \ncontrasting experiences of getting by in the \u2017NHS village\u2018 described by Anyton\u2018s lead and user. \nTo this extent, the insights suggested by drawing on the organisational sociological \nliterature on team work reinforce and extend some of the findings common from the wider user-\ninvolvement literature internationally. The institutional impediments to the influence of user \ninvolvement (Martin 2008b, Barnes et al. 2007, Contandriopoulos 2004) are not unique to public \nparticipation, since they also undermine efforts to create collaborative, team-based working \nwithin and across health-care professions. However, these impediments do seem more profound \nin relation to user involvement, due both to the size of the gap between professionals ensconced \nin the norms, rules and rituals of the health service and users outside these, and due to the way in \nwhich micro-level factors reinforce this gap. Given the time and effort needed to build \nintegrated, trusting teams, the way in which the social, spatial and temporal organisation of pilots \nbolstered the initial disinclination of pilot staff to engage with users seems an important practical \nissue to address, if we are to move beyond the persistent problems of professional indifference \nto, or even subversion of, users\u2018 views (Harrison and Mort 1998, Sleath and Rucker 2001). \nThe specific literature on trust and collaborative work is also analytically helpful here, in \nadding to our understanding of the dynamics of user involvement through team-based \norganisational forms. Newell and Swan (2000 p.1295) differentiate between three types of trust \nwhich they see as underlying the propensity to collaborate and share knowledge: \n companion trust, \u2015based on judgements of goodwill or personal friendships [and] continuing, \nreciprocal exchange\u2016; \n competence trust, \u2015based on perceptions of the others\u2018 competence to carry out the tasks that \nneed to be performed,\u2016 and deriving either from witnessing this competence firsthand or \nfrom \u2015contextual cues such as the reputation of the institution that the person works for or \nthe status of the professional group to which they belong\u2016; and \n commitment trust, based on \u2015contractual commitments between the parties,\u2016 which can act as a \nmore control-based failsafe (cf. Das and Teng 2001) that will continue to facilitate the \ncollaborative partnership if the other two forms of trust are lacking. \nThe important point here in relation to the development of partnership and team working \nbetween professionals and service users is the difficulty of nurturing any of these forms of trust to \na significant extent. Companion trust was hard to develop given social, spatial and temporal \nbarriers between users and staff. Competence trust is a problematic concept when the rationale \nfor the inclusion of users is not their expertise but their laity (Martin 2008a): users have no \ncontextual cues to rely on, such as institutional reputation or professional status, and here there \nwas also an absence of clear aims for involvement against which the performance of users might \nbe judged. Commitment trust, too, is a difficult notion in this context: no formal contract existed \nbetween users and staff, though given the expectation of Macmillan and the DoH that all pilots \ndevelop some form of user-involvement partnership in their projects, there was arguably at least \nThis is an electronic version of an article published in Sociology of Health & Illness 33(7): 1050-1065. \nThe definitive version is available at www.blackwell-synergy.com. \u00a9 2011 the authors \n12 \na minimum level of commitment from staff to users. This, however, was not necessarily \nreciprocated: users had no contractual commitment to the projects in which they were involved, \nand could, if they wanted, walk away without material or symbolic detriment. Nevertheless, this \nwas the form of trust on which the partnerships in four of the sites had to rely in the absence of \ncompanion or competence trust. This analysis reinforces the need for social, spatial and temporal \norganisation of teams that ensures opportunities for companion trust to flourish and to develop \ncompetence trust, if efforts to incorporate \u2017outsiders\u2018 such as involved service users into \ncollaborative teams are to be successful. We saw in the example of Anyton that companion and \ncompetence trust, according to the user, did eventually develop, but only very late in the three-\nyear pilot, and after many abortive attempts by the user to exert influence in the team. Difficulties \nwith the development of trust are not unique to users (as Walker et al. 2007 point out, other \ngroups external to strong institutional contexts may face similar challenges), but the problems \nwith developing contractual, competency and companion trust seem especially acute for this \ngroup. \nYet in Excepton, things were somewhat different. The micro-level factors that assisted the \nformation of a more functional partnership were largely absent from the other four sites: a \npurposive and selective recruitment process; users who were already familiar to some of the staff \nahead of the project; frequent meetings involving (only) core staff and users, and other \nopportunities for bonding among team members; a clear and agreed purpose for user \ninvolvement. Companion trust was already in place; competence trust (of a particular kind \nrelevant to the project) was accounted for in the selection of these users as ones who would \ncontribute productively and would not be \u2015difficult,\u2016 as the nurse here put it. This serves to \nunderline the need to build companion and competence trust to facilitate better collaboration \n(Newell and Swan 2000)\u2014especially where commitment trust is no more than minimal\u2014by \ncreating and using opportunities for social interaction (Finn et al., 2010b).  \nHowever, this \u2017strategic\u2018 approach also seemed to lead to a loss of the distinctiveness of the \nfunction of service-user involvement. Following the initial, calculated choice of users to involve, \nthrough time the distinction between the contributions of professional staff and users seemed to \nbe diminished, as the users were valued increasingly in the professionalised terms of their skilled \ncontribution to the ongoing success of the service. What this suggests, perhaps, is that users face \na particular challenge in the integration\u2013specialisation paradox that team work seeks to address \n(Donnellon 1996), which does not affect professionals in the same way. Lacking the identity and \nskill base that define a profession, and which provide a basis for the distinctiveness of its \ncontribution to a team, users seem especially vulnerable to a process of role blurring which can \nshift the practice of involvement away from the rationale for involving them in the first place. \nDefined by their laity rather than their specialist knowledge, the role of users can thus become \ndistorted. This suggests that rather than relying on abstract rationales for user involvement \nrelating (for example) to democratic accountability or \u2017lay expertise\u2018 (Martin 2008a), there is a \nneed for a much clearer exposition of what these rationales might mean in practice. Otherwise, \nthe successful functional integration of participatory processes into public-service governance \nironically risks bringing with it the unintended consequence of undermining the very reason for \ndoing it. \nThe notion of the \u2017team\u2018, then\u2014and the emphasis on integration, interdependence and \ncollaborative working that comes with it\u2014represents a model for the incorporation of users into \nhealth-service governance that seems laudable\u2014even unopposable. Yet the challenges of making \nthis aspiration real given group interests and powerful institutional forces are profound. These \nchallenges can be overcome so that \u2017team work\u2018 is realised, and users are \u2015not seen as users any \nlonger: they\u2018re part of the team,\u2016 as the Macmillan officer said of Excepton\u2018s pilot.  However, \nthis empirical analysis shows that in such situations, this apparently positive outcome can obscure \na more complex, and less unambiguously desirable, reality.  \nThis is an electronic version of an article published in Sociology of Health & Illness 33(7): 1050-1065. \nThe definitive version is available at www.blackwell-synergy.com. \u00a9 2011 the authors \n13 \nConclusion \nUsing concepts from organizational sociological writing on team work which has not previously \nbeen applied to this field, we have illustrated how efforts to make teams of professionals and \nusers face similar challenges to those involved in multidisciplinary team work. This highlights \ndifficulties with calls from policymakers for collaborative organisational forms that incorporate \nthose from beyond the NHS in NHS decision-making processes; indeed, due to their location \noutside the health professions, and the social, spatial and temporal organisation of their inclusion, \nservice users face particular extra difficulties in forging the relationships of trust that form the \nfoundation for collaboration. In this way, by going beyond studying teams that involve only \nprofessionals or professional and non-professional staff, our analysis extends both the literature \non the challenges involved in realising the team, and that which focuses on user involvement in \npublic-service provision. \nDrawing attention to an outlying case where team work was more successful, this paper \nalso indicates some of the interventions that might facilitate more inclusive, collaborative, team-\nlike partnerships. However, we have sought to show how the particular situation of users renders \nthem vulnerable to a loss of the distinctiveness of their role and contribution, perhaps more so \nthan professional groups attempting to reconcile integration and specialisation. The successful \nrealisation of the team risks sacrificing the distinctiveness of the user role; more attention is thus \nrequired to the question of how to operationalise the overarching rationales for involvement in \ndefinitions of the role of the service user qua service user, to provide a robust basis for retaining \nthe distinctiveness of this role in integrated teams and partnerships. \nAcknowledgements \nWe are grateful to Celia Davies, Mary Dixon-Woods, Sue Newell and two anonymous referees \nfor critical comments which helped us to improve this paper.
