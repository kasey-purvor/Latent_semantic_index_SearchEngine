Compared with eight other chronic\nconditions, Parkinson\u2019s disease imposes a relatively heavy burden on US veterans in the VHA health\ncare system.\nPatients\u2019 perceptions about how their illness affects themin their daily lives can differ from those of theirpractitioners1\u20133 and informal caregivers.4 It is particularly\nimportant that clinicians understand how patients experience\nchronic and often incurable conditions such as Parkinson\u2019s\ndisease, where the goals of treatment are to optimise their\nquality of life.5 Parkinson\u2019s disease gives rise to a range of\nphysically disabling and socially distressing symptoms.6 7\nEmpirical information about the impact of disease can be\ngathered from patients by measures of health related quality\nof life (HRQoL).8 In combination with clinical indicators,\nHRQoL data contribute to the appreciation of the overall\nimpact of disease on patients.9\nFormal study of HRQoL is only about 25 years old, and has\ngrown substantially over the last decade.8 Although method-\nological and conceptual challenges remain,5 10 HRQoL as an\noutcome has become an important standard for use in health\ncare interventions. It can also be used as a basis for assessing\nthe health status of populations, and to judge the burden of\ndisease by comparing clinical groups with the general popula-\ntion. At an individual level, HRQoL has been shown to be a\nsound predictor of mortality and morbidity,11 although\navailable measures are not always appropriate for use in rou-\ntine clinical practice.12\nThe most commonly used HRQoL instruments are meas-\nures which characterise patients using multidimensions or\nscales.13 A distinction is drawn between generic and disease\nspecific measures of HRQoL.3 Although there is debate about\nthe appropriate dimensions to include,14 generic assessments\noften cover measures of physical functioning, independence of\nliving, emotional\/mental wellbeing, and the effects of disease\non work and social activity. They allow broad population level\nanalyses and comparisons between patient groups, but they\ndo not focus on the special features of particular conditions\nthat cause concern to the sufferers.\nThe Veterans Administration health care system (VHA) is\none of the largest integrated systems nationally in the USA,\nwith around 145 medical centres in the 50 states. This system,\nwhich is federally funded, provides comprehensive care to\nmost veteran patients with service connected disabilities or\nwho qualify economically. Veterans who use the VHA tend to\nbe more disabled, economically disadvantaged, and have more\ncomplex medical and mental health problems than the\ngeneral US population or veterans who do not use the VHA\nsystem.15 Because the VHA recognises the importance of\nmonitoring the health outcomes of veterans using measures of\nfunctional status, HRQoL assessments are increasing on a\nnational basis. One of the most widely used generic measures\nin the VHA is the Veterans SF-36 (V\/SF-36), adapted and\nmodified from the medical outcomes study (MOS) version of\nthe SF-36.16\u201319\nIn this study we used the V\/SF-36 to evaluate the impact of\nParkinson\u2019s disease on HRQoL in a large VHA national sample\n(n = 14 530) of veterans diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nAbbreviations: HRQoL, health related quality of life; MCS, mental\ncomponent summary score of SF-36; MOS, medical outcomes study; PCS,\nphysical component summary score of SF-36; RE, role, emotional; RP,\nrole, physical; SF-36, short form 36 item health status questionnaire;\nVHA, Veterans Administration health care system; V\/SF-36, Veterans\nshort form 36 item health status questionnaire\nSee end of article for\nauthors\u2019 affiliations\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nCorrespondence to:\nMs Heather Gage,\nDepartment of Economics,\nUniversity of Surrey,\nGuildford GU2 7XH,\nSurrey, UK;\nh.gage@surrey.ac.uk\nReceived 5 March 2002\nIn revised form\n3 September 2002\nAccepted\n1 November 2002\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n163\nwww.jnnp.com\nThe statistical power from this large number of subjects has\nadvantages over previous studies that collected data from\nfewer than 250 respondents.20\u201322 The self reported HRQoL of\nveterans with Parkinson\u2019s disease is compared with that of the\nveterans without Parkinson\u2019s disease, and also with that of\nveterans reporting eight other neurological or chronic\ndiseases. To our knowledge, there have been no previous stud-\nies that have examined the relative illness burden of\nParkinson\u2019s disease. Many people with chronic disease suffer\nfrom multiple conditions, and the use of a generic instrument\nenables the health status of these people to be monitored.23 We\nused multivariable statistical techniques to control for\nsociodemographic differences and co-morbid conditions so\nthat the independent impact of particular diseases can be cal-\nculated and the unique effect of Parkinson\u2019s disease on HRQoL\ncan be estimated.\nMETHODS\nData\nThe study population is US veterans enrolled in the VHA. All\nveterans have the option of enrolling in VHA, and eligibility is\ndefined by seven priority categories:\n\u2022 groups 1, 2, and 3: veterans with service connected disabil-\nity of > 50%, 30\u201340%, and 10\u201320% respectively, and former\nprisoners of war;\n\u2022 group 4: veterans who are catastrophically disabled, house-\nbound, needing aid and attendance;\n\u2022 group 5: veterans with income and net worth below estab-\nlished thresholds;\n\u2022 group 6: veterans of World War I, \u201cagent orange,\u201d and \u201cGulf\nWar syndrome\u201d;\n\u2022 group 7: veterans who do not qualify under priority areas\n1\u20136 but may make co-payments for VHA services according\nto fixed schedules.\nOverall, 72.6% of VHA enrollees have alternative health care\ncoverage besides VHA: 52.7% have Medicare (federal coverage\nfor the aged or disabled), 19.1% have only private insurance,\nand 1% have only Medicaid (public coverage for the indigent).\nIn 1999, 38.2% of enrollees exclusively used VHA for health\ncare.24\nInspection of VHA administrative data for the fiscal years\n1997 to 1999 showed there were 55 637 veterans with a diag-\nnosis of Parkinson\u2019s disease (ICD-9-CM codes 332.0: Parkin-\nson\u2019s disease; 333.0: other degenerative diseases of the basal\nganglia, including Parkinsonian syndromes; 333.1: essential\nand other specified forms of tremor). This file was merged\nwith data from the 1999 VHA large national health survey of\nveteran enrollees,19 which had randomly sampled 1.4 million\nVHA enrollees, stratified for priority status, from a total VHA\npopulation of approximately 3.5 million, between July 1999\nand January 2000. In this way we were able to identify survey\nrespondents with a recent diagnosis of Parkinson\u2019s disease.\nThe core section of the 1999 VHA large national health sur-\nvey, which was completed by all respondents, collected data by\nmeans of a structured questionnaire on sociodemographic\nfactors and health status. To measure the prevalence of\nchronic diseases, veterans were asked whether or not a doctor\nhad ever told them they had each of 15 conditions\n(angina\/coronary heart disease, arthritis, benign prostatic\nhypertrophy, cancer, chronic low back pain, chronic lung\ndisease, congestive heart failure, depression, diabetes, hyper-\ntension, myocardial infarction, post-traumatic stress disorder,\nschizophrenia, spinal cord injury, stroke). Health status was\nmeasured using V\/SF-36.\nAs shown in table 1, SF-36 comprises 36 items, which are\ncombined into eight scales and summarised into the physical\n(PCS) and mental summary (MCS) scores. Items from each\nSF-36 scale were summed and raw scores were rescaled with\na standard range 0 (worst) to 100 (best). The eight scales were\ncombined into the two component summaries (PCS and\nMCS), using weights derived from a national probability sam-\nple. Each summary was then standardised with a mean of 50\nand a standard deviation of 10. This process allows compari-\nson across populations. Summaries have a consistent power\nadvantage over scales, given their increased precision.25\nThe reliability and validity of the modified SF-36 is well\nestablished in VHA populations and, as in the MOS SF-36 ver-\nsion, normalised to a US population.25\u201332 The V\/SF-36 uses five\npoint ordinal choices (no, none of the time, to yes, all of the\ntime) in the physical role limitations (RP) and emotional role\nlimitations (RE) scales, instead of dichotomised two point\nchoices (yes\/no), and adds about 5% to the precision of the\nPCS and MCS scores compared with the MOS SF-36.18 19 26\nIn addition to the core questionnaire, the VHA large\nnational health survey included five modules\u2014each allocated\nto a random 20% of sample members\u2014on smoking and alco-\nhol, diet and physical activity, satisfaction with care and the\ndoctor\u2013patient relationship, social support, and health care\ninsurance and utilisation. Two sets of weights were applied to\nresponses: first, to make the samples representative of the\ncomplete veteran enrollee population; and second, to correct\nfor the extent that responses were not randomly distributed\nacross all demographic groups.\nAnalysis\nFirst, the socioeconomic, demographic, health, and service utili-\nsation characteristics of survey respondents with Parkinson\u2019s\nTable 1 SF-36 items, scales, and component summaries*\nScales (items)\nComponent summary\nmeasure Scales (items)\nComponent summary\nmeasure\nPhysical functioning (PF) (10\nitems: ability to undertake\nactivities, carry, walk, climb\nstairs, bend, kneel, bathe,\ndress)\nPhysical component\nsummary (PCS)\nVitality (VT) (four items:\nenergy, fatigue)\nMental component\nsummary (MCS)\nRole physical (RP) (four items:\nphysical limitations to activity)\nSocial functioning (SF) (two\nitems: engagement in social\nactivity)\nBodily pain (BP) (two items:\nmagnitude and interference of\npain)\nRole emotional (RE) (three\nitems: emotional limitations\nto activities)\nGeneral health (GH) (four\nitems: perceptions of health\nstatus)\nMental health (MH) (five\nitems: nervous, peaceful,\nsad, happy)\n*Adapted from references 18 and 25.\n164 Gage, Hendricks, Zhang, et al\nwww.jnnp.com\ndisease were compared with those of respondents without a\ndiagnosis of Parkinson\u2019s disease using \u03c72 tests of association.\nSecond, differences in HRQoL between groups of survey\nrespondents were assessed. We used SUDAAN, a software\npackage specifically designed for statistical testing of complex\nsample datasets.33 Two multivariable least squares regression\nmodels (for PCS and MCS) calculated the mean V\/SF-36 sum-\nmary scores for veterans with Parkinson\u2019s disease and\nveterans with eight other chronic diseases (angina\/coronary\nheart disease, arthritis, chronic low back pain, congestive\nheart failure, depression, diabetes, spinal cord injury, stroke).\nThese eight neurological and chronic conditions were selected\nfor comparison with Parkinson\u2019s disease from the 15 self\nreported by survey respondents, because of their established\nadverse effects on HRQoL.19\nTwenty variables were entered into the regression models:\nfour sociodemographic characteristics (age, sex, race, educa-\ntion) that are known to influence HRQoL,28 a dichotomised\nvariable showing whether or not respondents had a diagnosis\nof Parkinson\u2019s disease in VHA treatment files in the fiscal years\n1997 to 1999, and 15 dichotomised variables for whether or\nnot respondents had self reported each of the chronic\nconditions included in the survey. The age and race variables\nwere each split into three categories for the purposes of the\nregression analysis (18\u201350, 51\u201365, > 65 years; white, black,\nother races). Education was divided into two categories,\ndefined by whether or not the respondent had received more\nthan 12 years of education.\nThe regression coefficients for each disease indicate an\neffect size: the difference in PCS (or MCS) between veterans\nwith the disease and veterans without it, after controlling for\nthe effect of four sociodemographic features and 15 co-\nmorbidities. The effect size indicates the independent or\nunique impact of each disease on HRQoL. Results are\npresented here for Parkinson\u2019s disease and the eight selected\ncomparison conditions.\nRESULTS\nDescriptive analysis of sample\nOf 887 775 respondents to the 1999 VHA large national health\nsurvey (overall response rate 63.1%), 14 530 (1.6%) had a\ndiagnosis of Parkinson\u2019s disease in VHA treatment files for fis-\ncal years 1997 to 1999.\nThe characteristics of survey respondents with a diagnosis\nof Parkinson\u2019s disease are compared with those of respondents\nwithout Parkinson\u2019s disease in table 2. As might be expected\nwith denominators of this magnitude, differences between\ngroups were significant for all characteristics (p < 0.001), but\nsmall differences may not be important. Compared with other\nveterans, those with Parkinson\u2019s disease were more likely to be\n65 years of age or older, white, retired, have had 12 or fewer\nyears of education, be catastrophically disabled, be enrolled in\nMedicare, rely exclusively on the VHA for health care services,\nand report recent deteriorations in physical and mental\nhealth.\nVeterans with Parkinson\u2019s disease reported, on average, 4.0\nco-morbid conditions, compared with 3.2 among veterans\nwithout Parkinson\u2019s disease. All recorded conditions were sig-\nnificantly more prevalent among veterans with Parkinson\u2019s\ndisease (p < 0.001).

Men had a lower MCS on\naverage by 0.94 of a point than women. Younger age groups had\nhigher mean PCS scores (by one to two points) and lower mean\nMCS scores (by 1.75 to 3.24 points) than subjects aged over 65\nyears. Having no education beyond high school reduced PCS\nand MCS scores by 1.98 and 2.48 points, respectively.\nDISCUSSION\nThe analysis quantifies the extent of the negative impact of\nParkinson\u2019s disease on HRQoL, as measured by the V\/SF-36,\ncontrolling for the effect of four sociodemographic variables\nand 15 co-morbid conditions. The results confirm that people\nwith Parkinson\u2019s disease carry a relatively heavy illness\nburden in both physical and mental dimensions of HRQoL\ncompared with those suffering from eight other neurological\nor chronic conditions.\nAfter removing the effect of sociodemographic factors and\nother diseases, the PCS and MCS scores for veterans with Par-\nkinson\u2019s disease were lower than those for veterans with\nangina\/coronary heart disease, arthritis, diabetes, chronic low\npack pain, congestive heart failure, and stroke. Only subjects\nwith spinal cord injury and depression recorded a lower\nHRQoL than those with Parkinson\u2019s disease. Individuals with\nspinal cord injury had mean PCS scores that were slightly\nbelow (by 0.34 points) those of the Parkinson\u2019s disease\nsubjects, but their mean MCS scores were 2.52 points higher.\nOn average, the MCS of subjects with depression was 5.44\npoints lower than that of subjects with Parkinson\u2019s disease,\nalthough their mean PCS was 3.16 points higher. The\nrelatively low HRQoL of subjects with Parkinson\u2019s disease was\nnot surprising, given the plethora of physical and social prob-\nlems attributed to this disease.34\nThe unique effect of Parkinson\u2019s disease is to lower PCS by\nan average of 4.10 points below that of people without a diag-\nnosis of Parkinson\u2019s disease. Although chronic low back pain\nand arthritis imposed larger negative effects on the physical\ndimensions of HRQoL than Parkinson\u2019s disease, the mean PCS\nscores for those conditions were higher. Many people with\nParkinson\u2019s disease suffer these co-morbidities (43% and 58%\nwith self reported chronic low back pain and arthritis in the\nVHA large national health survey, respectively).\nOnly depression had a larger unique effect on mental health\ndimensions of HRQoL than Parkinson\u2019s disease, and markedly\nso (\u221212.95 v \u22123.42; a difference equivalent to almost 1 SD).\nRecent international evidence confirms that depression has a\nmajor effect on the HRQoL of people with Parkinson\u2019s\ndisease,20 22 35 36 but the debate as to whether depression in this\ndisorder is reactive or endogenous remains unresolved.37 38 If\ndepression is triggered by the same biological mechanisms\nthat cause Parkinson\u2019s disease, the logic of calculating\nindependent effects for both Parkinson\u2019s disease and depres-\nsion might be questioned. We therefore repeated our\nregression analyses for PCS and MCS controlling for the same\nfour sociodemographic variables and for a diagnosis of\nParkinson\u2019s disease, but replacing the 15 individual co-\nmorbidities with a count of the co-morbidities reported by\nsurvey respondents.\nThis revised specification does not show disease relativities,\nand compared with the extended models it reduces explana-\ntory power (R2 of PCS, 28.1% v 33.1%; MCS, 22.3% v 38.7%).\nThe results of the reduced model (not reported here in full)\nshowed that the mean impact of one chronic disease was to\nlower HRQoL by about 0.25 of 1 SD (PCS, \u03b2 \u22122.678, SE 0.006,\np < 0.001; MCS, \u03b2 \u22122.540, SE 0.006, p < 0.001). The impact of\nage, sex, race, and education were very similar to those in the\nextended version.\nRemoving adjustment for individual diseases had very little\neffect on mean PCS of veterans with Parkinson\u2019s disease or on\nthe associated effect size coefficients (32.93 v 32.72; \u22123.90 v\n\u22124.10 in the reduced and extended models, respectively).\nHowever, when depression was not explicitly controlled for,\nthe mean MCS of subjects with Parkinson\u2019s disease fell by\nnearly two points (from 41.48 to 39.56), and the negative\nunique effect of Parkinson\u2019s disease became \u22125.37 (compared\nwith \u22123.42). This is not surprising given that depression is a\nmajor determinant of MCS, 43% of survey respondents with\nParkinson\u2019s disease self reported a previous diagnosis of\ndepression, and the mean MCS, of subjects with depression\nwas lower than that of subjects with Parkinson\u2019s disease by a\nconsiderable margin. It has been shown that people with Par-\nkinson\u2019s disease adapt differently to their illness, depending\non their physical status, psychological attitude, and social\nsupport.39 40 While there is no simple relation between disabil-\nity and depression,41 coping and behavioural strategies may\nreduce depressive symptoms.42 43\nPublished reports have shown that the MOS version of the\nSF-36 is psychometrically sound for measuring HRQoL of\npeople with Parkinson\u2019s disease. More advanced disease stage\n(measured by the unified Parkinson\u2019s disease ranking scale\nand the Hoehn and Yahr index), and complications such as\ndyskinesia, have been associated with lower SF-36 component\nand scale scores. Also, few floor or ceiling effects were found\nwhen SF-36 was used with people with Parkinson\u2019s\ndisease.9 44 45 Moreover, high correlations have been recorded\nbetween SF-36 and similar scales on the disease specific\nPDQ-39.46\nThere are several limitations to this study. First, it was a\ncross sectional sample and therefore the associations between\nvariables described were purely descriptive and cannot imply\ncausality. Second, co-morbidities and HRQoL were self\nreported, and correlated error may inflate the regression coef-\nficients in some of these models and exaggerate the unique\neffects. However, the magnitude of the impact of co-\nmorbidities on HRQoL has been described previously and our\nresults corroborate those findings.27 Third, there are selection\neffects arising because patients chose to use the VHA. We do\nnot have internal data to model those effects, so adjustments\nfor age or other demographics may be biased. However, the\ncoefficients generated in the models presented are not all that\ndifferent from those reported using a non-VHA population.17\nThe VHA population is different in many respects from the\ngeneral populations, including the predominance of service\nrelated occupations and of male enrollees. The VHA popula-\ntion (mean PCS, 36.91; MCS, 45.08) carries a greater disease\nburden than the US civilian population (mean PCS, 43.60;\nMCS, 52.30) by more than one half of 1 SD.19 Moreover, the\ndistribution of illness is different in VHA in that younger\ngroups in VHA have worse SF-36 scores in all but the physical\nfunctioning scale.27 A community based study that used SF-36\nto investigate the HRQoL of 228 people with Parkinson\u2019s\ndisease in Finland found that women scored significantly\nlower than men in five of the scales, and confirmed the central\nrole of depression in impairing HRQoL.46\nSome observers have noted that people with chronic\ndiseases rate their HRQoL higher than their physicians.47 In\nthis regard, the concept of response shift has received\nattention.48 Like the disability paradox,49 it refers to the possi-\nbility that people with chronic illnesses adjust their internal\nstandards and values to accommodate the realities of their\ncondition. It is suggested that they recalibrate their assess-\nment of disability50 and, as a result of lowered expectations,51\nthey self report a higher quality of life than a healthy person\nwould assign to any given level of impaired functioning.\nExisting measures of HRQoL do not show response shift\nbecause they do not relate self reported experiences to\nexpectation.52 To the extent that it occurs, response shift\ndepresses disease effect sizes which are calculated as the\nQuality of life in Parkinson\u2019s disease 167\nwww.jnnp.com\ndifference between a clinical group and the general popula-\ntion. It is unimportant in intercondition comparisons,\nhowever, unless it has differential impact across diseases.\nConclusions\nDespite differences between the VHA and non-VHA popula-\ntions, the proportion of people with Parkinson\u2019s disease in the\nVHA (1.6%) is equivalent to broader population estimates.53\nOther American evidence, based on a sample of 193 individu-\nals with Parkinson\u2019s disease completing SF-36 in an out-\npatient setting, confirms that most subjects had lower scores\nthan the general public on most dimensions, but showed that\nPCS, and to a lesser extent MCS, varied with disease\nseverity.9 45 54 The scores calculated in the present study are\naverages, and closer inspection of available data is required to\nsee how generic self reported HRQoL in the VHA population\nvaries with clinical indicators and service utilisation. The\nfindings so far suggest, however, that the relative illness bur-\nden of veterans in the VHA with Parkinson\u2019s disease is high in\nboth physical and mental dimensions of HRQoL, and thereby\nreinforce the case for multiprofessional team approaches to\nmanagement.55 56\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis research was supported in part by the Center for Health Quality,\nOutcomes and Economic Research (CHQOER), VAMC, Bedford, Mas-\nsachusetts, USA, the Department of Veterans Affairs, Health Services\nResearch and Development Service and the Office of Quality and Per-\nformance (10Q), Washington DC, USA.

As with many medical scholars of his time, he\nwas trained in clinical neurology, psychiatry, and neuropathology, a\nwide spectrum of disciplines now seldom feasible. In 1874 he trained\nin Berlin with Westphal, and from 1875 he worked at the later\ninfamous asylum of Wehnen. Then he became lecturer in neurology\nand psychiatry in Prague where he met Otto Kahler, with whom he\npublished papers on oculomotor palsies, cortical localisation, and\nsyringomyelia. They established \u2018Kahler-Pick\u2019s law\u2019\u2014incoming fibres\nin the posterior columns of the cord from a higher level displace\nmedially those that enter at a lower level.\nHe found promotion to the chair of neuropsychiatry in Prague but\nencountered many problems related to academic teaching in both\nGerman and Czech languages, controlled by the Austro-Hungarian\nempire. Essential provisions were often lacking and he met with much\nhostility and resentment1 that often hampered his work. Despite this,\nhis remarkable ability to communicate with patients with psychoses\nand aphasia was admired, and his history-taking became legendary.\nAn intellectual man, Pick loved classical music and in his home his\nbooks in many languages were piled from floor to ceiling. He was\ndescribed as a \u201cnoble minded, excessively modest but fearless man,\nthe essence of calm serenity\u201d.2 He retired in 1921, but continued some\nwork, despite troublesome cataracts and urinary tract stones. On 4\nApril 1924, at the age of 73, he died of urinary sepsis following blad-\nder surgery.\nPick published about 350 papers on diverse topics. Many were case\nreports dealing with neuropsychology and behavioural neurology. He\nwas among the first to give reliable descriptions of visual hallucina-\ntions, micrographia, palilalia, and reduplicating paramnesia. He wrote\nimportant papers on apraxia and aphasia.3 He described the fibre\nbundles in the medulla oblongata (Pick\u2019s bundle). His 1898 book on\nneuropathology was a landmark in this field.4\nIn his work on aphasia he introduced the term agrammatism.\nAgrammatical speech was the basic defect of aphasic disorders. Wer-\nnicke influenced his views on language but Jackson probably had a\ngreater influence on his concepts of how language was disrupted.\nThey had great mutual respect and shared a distaste for speculation;\nboth wrote in terse prose.\nPick\u2019s disease\nIn 1892, Pick described a 71 year old man who presented with\nprogressive loss of language and a failing mind.5 After death, the brain\nshowed asymmetrical atrophy as opposed to the more diffuse atrophy\nof Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The condition described by Pick \u201con the rela-\ntionship between senile atrophy of the brain and aphasia\u201d6 was often\nconfused with Alzheimer\u2019s and vascular dementias. Pick published\nthree further papers, in which he showed patients with severe apha-\nsia and apraxia who had a \u201cprogressive circumscribed atrophy\u201d of the\ncortex.7\u20139 He regarded these patients as suffering from a variant of\nsenile dementia. Attention was drawn to the aphasic and later the\napraxic side of the syndrome, but eventually the distinctive pathology\nestablished it as an entity.\nAlzheimer in 1911 confirmed the circumscribed cortical (lobar)\natrophy,10 and found the characteristic Pick bodies: ovoid, homogene-\nous, smooth-edged, and intensely argyrophilic neuronal inclusions.\nGans introduced the name Pick\u2019s disease in 1922.11\nJ M S Pearce\n304 Beverley Road, Anlaby, Hull HU10 7BG; jmspearce@freenet.co.uk\nReferences\n1 Sittig O.
