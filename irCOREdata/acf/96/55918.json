It contributes to the emergence \nof followership in educational administration, management and leadership practice and \nresearch (Thody, 1994, 1997, 2000, 2001). To make a more extensive understanding of \nfollowership easier, this article discusses routes to acceptability for followership, \nproposes the first lexicon for education followership and reflects on the importance of  \nfollowership. \n  \nFollowership exists in all educational organizations and in any phase of education or \nother business. Each role in an organization includes some following and some leading. \nGenerally, the nearer one is to the top of a hierarchy, the fewer are the followership \nelements and, conversely, the nearer one is to the base of a hierarchy, the more will be the \nfollowership elements. The extent of followership will vary according to different \nprojects, personalities, contexts and how other people decide to perform their roles. \nFollowership is as natural as leadership since \u2018the proclivity to follow...exists, at least \nlatently, in every human being\u2019 (Gardner, 1997: 34). It is also as important as leadership. \n \nMost of the few other writers and researchers on followership see it as only having a life \nthat is determined by leadership. In contrast, this author hypothesises that followership \nhas a life of its own too. This \u2018life\u2019 is significant to in its effect on leaders and on other \nfollowers. Followers are as much independent as leaders; what they do is at least as much \nan outcome of their personalities, their positions, their purposes and their own planning, \nas it is of leadership.  \n \n \nMethodology \n \nThe author first sought others researching followership. The search was thorough, wide-\nranging and long but yielded only 231 sources1, a tiny figure in comparison with the tens \nThody\/Followership aricle\/1 \n  \nof thousands of sources on leadership. Table I shows how few followership studies exist \nand the lack of both primary research and of a focus on education.     \n \n \n \n \nTable I: Literature on Followership \nReferences  n=231 \nUsing the words \u2018 follower\u2019, \u2018non-leader\u2019,  \n\u2018subordinate\u2019 or \u2018member\u2019 in their titles  \n \n41 \n                       Of these 41,   \na) books \nb) research studies \nc) approach followership as a means of  \n  improving or understanding leadership \n \n  3 \n18 \n22 \n \n \n \nOf the 18 research studies,  \nn in educational contexts  \n \n12 \nOf the 12  research studies in educational \ncontexts,  \nn using US university students as subjects  \nn in a US school \nn in English schools \n \n \n10 \n  1 \n  1 \n \nFollowership primary research has used university, business or military contexts, largely \nUSA and quantitative (Holmes et al 1980; Valikangas and Okumura 1997; Volgelaar and \nKuipers 1997; Eden et al 2000). Literature on middle management and deputy school \nprincipals was searched but virtually all concern how to operate as leaders not as \nfollowers. The scant literature stimulated the author\u2019s gradual creation of a followership \nlexicon (Table II below), refined as the author garnered informal reactions to her various \narticles, conference presentation and lectures.  \n \nOpportunity populations of academic and practitioner conference audiences in 2002 pilot \ntested the lexicon. Their responses to questionnaires issued and collected at the \nconferences both confirmed and refined it. The conference audiences were 131 from eight \ncountries at an international meeting in Sweden, (61% Swedish) and twenty-six at a \nconference in England. Of the 157, 111 were school principals, deputies or senior \nteachers; twenty-four university staff ranged from PhD students to Associate Deans; ten \nheld various levels of seniority in local, central or regional governments and the \nremainder were consultants.  \n \nThese had to think about one\/two work colleagues who were legally their subordinates \nand whom they considered to be, first, effective workers and secondly, ineffective \nworkers. They then chose words to describe them from the author\u2019s followership lexicon \nand were asked to list any additional words in English or other languages that are used to \nindicate \u2018followers\u2019 or \u2018followership\u2019. While no claims can be made that the audiences \nwere representative samples, their views were helpful in confirming that early revisions to \nthe vocabulary were proceeding appropriately, in suggesting an order of preference for \nfollowership descriptions, some additional possible words for followers and in \nformulating a more sophisticated questionnaire for later research.  \n \nThody\/Followership aricle\/2 \n  \nBefore these outcomes are discussed further, the acceptability of the word \u2018followership\u2019 \nis debated.  \n \n \n \nFinding  routes to followership acceptability  \n \nA key to gaining acceptance for followership as a legitimate and important area for study \nhas seemed to lie in finding substitute words.  This is because in English culture, \nfollowership has negative connotations of \u2018followersheep\u2019 and followership. No-one \nwants to be regarded as one who follows blindly like sheep nor do people in the \negalitarian twenty-first century perceive themselves as of lower status to others. \nWeakness is seen as synonymous with following (Fullen, 1995, 23) and as failure to \nbecome a leader  (Ouston, 1993).  \n \nThe humour and anger which greeted the author\u2019s early conference presentations on \n\u2018followership\u2019 in the mid 1990s demonstrated followership\u2019s lowly status so the author \nadopted the subterfuge of  \u2018non-leader\u2019 to persuade reviewers and audiences that \nfollowership is serious (Thody, 2001). Other authors found the same; few used \u2018follower\u2019 \nin article titles. Others disguised followers as \u2018subordinates\u2019 (Atwater et al,  1995), \n\u2018members\u2019(Gemmil and Oakley, 1992), less expert peers (Gronn, 1996), nonleaders and \nobservers (Meindl, 1990), non-managers (Engels, 1997, 26), audience (to the leaders as \nactors) (Gardner and Avolio 1998), \u2018stewards...or partners\u2019 (Petersen and Beekly, 1997) \nand \u2018contributors\u2019 (Williams, 1998).  \n \nThis substitution denies the reality that followership exists where a person in an \norganization has someone (or a group) legally superordinate. All of us have to adjust to, \naccept, support or otherwise relate to, those performing leadership activities who have the \nright, or power, or influence to lead us. Each of us is both follower and leader.  \n \nThe acceptance of followership depends, however, on more than just semantics. Schools \ntoday exhibit \u2018distinctive general homogeneity\u2019 (Williams, 1998, 8) apparently conducive \nmore to egalitarian collegiality than to followership hierarchies. In England, for example, \nteaching staff are legally hierarchically distributed but have similar intelligence, \neducational achievements and qualifications and one of the shortest teachers\u2019 pay scale \nranges in Europe. Administrative staff increasingly also have similar backgrounds and \nattitudes (O\u2019Sullivan, Thody and Wood, 2000; Ellis 2003). Shared leadership is regarded \nas morally just and intrinsically valuable (Wallace, 2001:154).   \n \nThis climate seems antithetical to followership but other factors offset it: \n\u2022 External stakeholders enforce school bureaucratic hierarchies (Simkins, 1999; \nWallace, 2001:165) especially in England\u2019s self-managing schools since the mid-\n1980s (Evetts, 1993) with increased pay differentials between principals and \nother staff.  \n\u2022 Collegiality appears to be a desired, rather than an actual situation in schools, it is \nmuch criticized and conflicts with human nature (Bennett et al, 1992, 10; \nGardner, 1997, 24; Brundrett, 1998).   \n\u2022 Current structural interpretations offer scope for followership too in, for example, \nthe management of influence (Madison et al, 1980), the construction of shared \nmeaning (Ferris  et al, 1989), the achievement of aims not sanctioned by the \nThody\/Followership aricle\/3 \n  \norganization (Mintzberg, 1985; Furnham, 1997) and the complex decision \nmaking that determines the relative power of  those involved (Bush, 1995, 74-77).  \n\u2022 Theoretical doors to followership\u2019s entrance include Gronn\u2019s concept of \u2018conjoint \nagency\u2019 (2000:308), the 19802\/90s teams and empowerment movements \n(Wallace and Hall, 1994; Wallace, 2001) and anti-leadership nihilism (Miner \n1975; Lakomski, 1998).  \n \nExploring the territory: naming the new discoveries \n \nThe author developed her own lexicon for followers (Table II) in educational \norganizations, having discovered that existing ones were for business or other contexts \nand contained mainly negative words (Bucholtz and Roth, 1987; Kelley, 1988 and 1992; \nMeindl, 1990; Chaleff, 1995; Brown and Thornborrow, 1996; Boyd and Taylor 1998; \nNelson et al, 1998; Robbins and Finlay, 1998; Conger, 1999; Sevier, 1999). Such \nnegativity is regarded as \u2018dangerously misleading\u2019 even by authors who are themselves \nnegative (Brown and Thornborrow, 1996: 5). The author\u2019s lexicon used some other \nauthors\u2019 terms which seemed suitable for transfer to education, added new ones and \ncategorized the descriptors into:  \n \na) holistic personality types - basic, largely innate, follower characteristics, describing \ngeneral behaviours mainly, but not entirely, irrespective of the type of leader(s) with \nwhom they are working or of their organizations\u2019 climate.  \n \nb) specific roles. Any personality type follower may perform one, or combine several, of \nthese roles and\/or select them as appropriate to the organizational context, type of \nleadership encountered or the personality of the follower. A leader may consciously \nor subconsciously direct followers into specific roles and there could be training for \nsuch roles  \n \nBoth types and roles were each grouped as either positively effective or negatively \neffective2. The author deliberately did not design a category of \u2018ineffective\u2019 followers \nsince this would infer that followers are unimportant to the success or failure of an \norganization. Followers, however, always impact on their organizations. \n \nThe lists in Table II were originally presented alphabetically to the conference audiences. \nTheir questionnaire responses indicated acceptance for the proposed vocabulary but the \nnumbers selecting each descriptor provided an indication of each word\u2019s popularity so the \nalphabetic order of the list was changed to reflect these. Respondents\u2019 proposals for \nadditional words for followership (predominantly negative) have been added to Table II \nin italics to distinguish them from the original list.   \n \n \nTable II: Thody\u2019s typology of followers  \n(questionnaire respondents\u2019 additions in italics; % to the nearest whole number) \nHolistic Personality Types Specific Roles \nPositively Effective Follower Types \nIndependent                             21%                          \nActive-passive                        19%                 \nEntrepreneurial                        19%                      \nLoyalist                                     15% \nExemplary\/exceptional            12% \nPositively Effective Follower Roles \nCo-ordinator                                  25% \nAspirant, mentee, apprentice      11% \nDisciple                                           10% \nGatekeeper \u2013 filter                          10% \nSidekick, partner, comrade             9% \nThody\/Followership aricle\/4 \n  \nInterdependent                           8% \nTransactional                              6% \nEnglish \nPuller-together, Opportunist, Crew, Those in the \ntrenches \nSwedish \nMedverkande    Participator \nMedfoljare         Partner-Co-follower \nKompanjon        Equal working partner \nFolje                    Follows \u2018king or queen\u2019 \nStodjare              Supporter \nMedansrang,     Co-responsible \nZulu \nAmalunga         Team members \nAbalingani,       Partners \nGerman \nMitarbeiter,       Co-operator\/Co-worker \nLoyaler mitarbeiter, Loyal co-worker \n                                                       n responses = 348 \nToxic Handler                                   9% \nSecond in command                        8% \nRescuer                                             7%                      \nMuse                                                 7%                \nResnatronic                                      4% \n \nEnglish  \nSupportive challenger, henchman \nSwedish \nMedhjalpare     Assistant\/helper \nMedarbetare Co-worker\/Co-operator\/Supporter  \nVapenohagare One who carries your weapons \nTross                Military team\/the maintenance troop \nLarjunge          Like Jesus follower \u2013 Acolyte  \nUgandan \nOmuweereze    Servant (in the biblical sense) \nSlovakian \nTien                  Shadow \n                                                        n responses =321 \nNegatively Effective Follower Types \nAlienated                                     14% \nIsolated                                        12% \nPassive                                        11% \nDependents                                10% \nObservers                                     9% \nReluctant-resistive                      8% \nSheep                                            8% \nMachiavellian                              7% \nPlateaued                                      7% \nSurvivor                                        7% \nYes people, dependent, sycophant 7% \n \nEnglish \nAbsent-minded, Perspective changer, Critical, \nDistrustful, Disorganised, Unesteemed, \nDisillusioned, Limiter (limits involvement or own \nskills negatively), Lazy, NATO (No Action Talk \nOnly), Hangers-back, Traditionalist, Dependent \nsurvivor, Self-serving, Narrow-viewed, Incompetent, \nLemming \nSwedish \nMedlopare       Co-runner\/passive follower \nRyttare            Rider \nPapegoja           (Bird) always repeats what the last \n                           person said \nSlovakian \nOportunista     Opportunist \n                                          n responses =359 \nNegatively Effective  Follower Roles \nCommunication distorter               46% \nSaboteur                                          28% \nToxic creator                                   26% \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEnglish \nFloater, \n Reluctant \n Holding-role \nNon-communicato \nSwedish \nMotarbetare         Against-worker \nStovelslickare      Boot-licker \nVorslickare           Ass-licker \nEfterapare             Duplicator \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                         n responses=159 \n \n \nPositively Effective Follower Types \n \nActive-passives - loyal and active supporters of leaders\u2019 decisions they like rather than of \nthe leaders themselves; if they don\u2019t like decisions, they will be passive supporters neither \nopposing nor refusing to act. They are ruled by self-defined rationality for organizational \nneeds.  \n \nThody\/Followership aricle\/5 \n  \nEntrepreneurs cope well in the businesses which England\u2019s educational organizations \nhave become. Entrepreneurs are independent companies within their institutions.  \n \nIndependents  act on their own initiative, making responsible contributions to the well \nbeing of the organization without  being asked to do so.  \n \nExemplary\/exceptionals support and work closely with leaders, participate actively in \ndecision making, are willing\/able to question and critique leaders\u2019 ideas, think \nindependently, are energetic and assertive risk-takers and self-starters.  \n \nLoyalists logically justify their support for leaders before granting their quietly \ndetermined and unwavering loyalty.  \n \nInterdependents co-operate, assist, support, unite with and care for leaders with whose \nideas they are closely congruent, almost interchangeable.  \n \nTransactionals acknowledges the use of delegated power by the follower (Beatty and \nLee, 1992), the importance of lower-level exchanges (Hoskins, 1988) and subordinate \nperceptions of subordinate strategic choice (Pratt, 1984, 304).  \n \nPositively Effective Follower roles \n \nCo-ordinators are elbow joints like middle managers whose job is where horizontal and \nvertical lines meet on the organizational matrix. Co-ordinators mediate, negotiate and \ninterpret connections between strategic and operational levels (Steven and Woolridge, \n1997).  \n \nAspirant, mentee, apprentice are all leadership trainees roles who work to acquire \nleadership skills. They will be either very close to the leader in order to make a good \nimpression and use learning opportunities or very far from the leader from nervousness in \nthe presence of greatness, from frequent attendance on training programmes or because \nthey do not want to appear \u2018pushy\u2019. \n \nDisciples teaching and interpret for others what they have learnt from the leader. \n  \nGatekeeper-filters select which the information\/problems\/challenges\/requests coming to \nleaders will go to them. They are loyal and organizationally knowledgeable; their value in \nreducing the burden on the leader is unquestioned.  \n \nSidekicks, partners, comrades either have no official role in the organization, or assume a \nsemi-official role. Sidekicks usually accompany the leader physically but are officially \ninvisible.  On this rests their helpfulness; they have little vested interest in the leader\u2019s \nown role but help the leader to make contributions.  \n \nToxic Handlers are altruistic, \u2018heading off\u2019 trouble before it ever reaches the leaders. \nToxic handlers sense problems arising and cure then before the leaders have to deal with \nthem or even hear about them (Frost and Robinson, 1999).  \n \nSeconds-in-command, a military analogy, have a known, clear and accepted place for \nwhich the follower wants and maintains the boundaries.  These followers suppress in \nThody\/Followership aricle\/6 \n  \npublic any differences of opinion with the leader, consciously develop skills which the \nleader does not have or does not chose to have and transmits as accurately as possible \nleaders\u2019 views to other followers. \n \nMuses suggest ideas, or provide catalysts for ideas, but  allow the leader to take credit for \nthem (Berg, 2001)  \n \nRescuers are \u2018otherwise unexceptional individuals who, during the Nazi era, risked \nsevere penalties as they helped those whom they considered to be unfairly singled out for \npersecution\u2019 (Gardner, 1997,  35).  For schools in exception circumstances (such as \nEnglish schools graded  as \u2018failing\u2019) the rescuer would be the follower who supports the \nprincipal who seems destined to be dismissed.   \n \nResnatronics are deputies who either cannot achieve principalship or who elect to remain \ndeputies \u2018plateaued\u2019, unavailed (James and Whiting, 1998) or career deputies. \nResnatronic is a new name for this hitherto overlooked group. A resnatron is a tetrode \nvalve with four electrodes used to generate high power at high frequencies - an excellent \ndescription of deputies\u2019 lives in English schools. The word recalibrates attitudes to \nelective deputies which is important when  44 % of England\u2019s deputy principals do not \nwant a principalship and over 50% are not actively seeking principalships  (James and \nWhiting, 1998).   \nNegatively Effective Follower Types \n \nAlienates withdraw from leader-follower relationships. They do not join decision making \nnor support leaders but seldom openly oppose them. They are disgruntled, recognisable as \nthose \u2018muttering\u2019 during staff meetings, sitting with arms folded or eyes closed and \ncontributing only such statements as \u2018We tried that before and it didn\u2019t work\u2019.  They are \nnon-participants, getting by on the least work possible. Alienated followers are critical \nand independent in their thinking but passive in their work conduct. (Kelly, 1992; Sevier, \n1999) \n \nIsolates  are \u2018going nowhere\u2019 (Joel, 1997, 7), choosing to be virtually outside the \norganization.  \n \nDependants seek guidance and approval from leaders before actions but they may be just \nthe immature effective followers (Bucholtz and Roth, 1987; Roe and Baker 1989).  \n \nPassives follow instructions, do not oppose anything nor indicate their support. They are \nneutral and disinterested, best typified as those who work precisely from \u2018nine-to-five\u2019.  \n \nObservers  are passive and will alter their allegiances according to whom they assess the \nlikely winner to be as they watch what happens. \n \nReluctant-resistives are alienates who oppose the leader and publicly. Their resistance \nmay be reluctantly expressed, e.g. \u2018I am sorry to have to disagree but...\u2019. Leaders\u2019 \nsuggestions will be politely received but not acted on or action will be significantly  \ndelayed.   \n \nSheep are passive, uncritical, lack initiative, purpose and a sense of responsibility. At best \nthey are able to perform the tasks assigned to them but then come to a stop (Kelly, 1988).  \nThody\/Followership aricle\/7 \n  \n \nPlateaued followers have travelled as far through the organization as they are likely to go \nbut are not recognisably at \u2018the top\u2019 nor are they likely to get there, being precluded by \nability, age or office politics. With no chance of personal development, plateaued \nfollowers are at best diligent but uninspired performers and at worst,  under-performers \nand job-avoiders.    \n \nMachiavellians are slavish and unquestioning followers of leaders who ruthlessly \nexercise power, \u2018using guile and deception when expedient...[and showing] indifference \nto the concerns of others\u2019 (Owens, 1995, 122-3).  \n \nSurvivors are \u201cfence sitters\u201d who adapt chameleon like to new conditions (Kelly, 1988).  \n \nYes people are unenterprising being completely dependent on leaders for inspiration. \nThey can be aggressively deferential sycophants (Roe and Baker, 1989). \n \nNegatively Effective Follower Roles \n \nThese \u2018dark angels...addicts, crooks, fanatics, sociopaths - the organizational equivalent \nof the undead\u2019 (Robbins and Finley, 1998, 69), can be divided into:  \n \nCommunication distorters deliberately warp messages from a leader, causing confusion \nand disaffection.    \n \nSaboteurs are either embittered followers who perceive themselves as having been badly \ntreated by leaders or who consider that leaders are wrong or weak.  They actively oppose \ntheir leaders (Sevier, 1999, 13) usually by covert micro-political tactics arising from their \nMachiavellian loyalty to an alternative leader but some are overtly domineering and \ndemanding (Robbins and Finley, 1998). Saboteurs may camouflage themselves as \nleaders\u2019 friends so when illegal drugs are discovered in the technology laboratory on \nParents\u2019 Evening, enquire after the Head of ICT who was handing the leader champagne \njust before the discovery. \n \nToxic creators encourage problems to grow rather than be solved and invent some if none \nis available.  \n \nWhy use this lexicon as a map?  \n \nDeveloping the new area of followership for research arose from the author\u2019s questioning \nof the received wisdom that leadership is all that matters to success. This \u2018wisdom\u2019  \noverburdens leaders and fails to credit the effect of  positive and negative followers.  \n \nThe 2000s educational leaders are viewed as saviours able to rescue failing organizations \nor improve even good schools. This expectation leads to stress, resignations, dismissals \nand too few wanting to become principals despite much increased salaries (Statt, 1994; \nChaplin, 2001). Leaders are raised \u2018to heights from which they can rarely fail to \ndisappoint\u2019 (Gabriel, 1997: 316). A dependence culture results; followers do not take \nresponsibility themselves because a messiah has come. Followers are intellectually and \nemotionally deskilled (Gemmill and Oakley, 1992:119). \n \nThody\/Followership aricle\/8 \n  \nSchool inspections by England\u2019s Office for Standards in Education (OFSTED) reinforce \nover-reliance on leaders. Inspectors grade school leadership almost entirely based on their \nassessment of the school principal. Teachers are rated for their classroom duties towards \nchildren but not in their followership roles towards colleagues. When a school is rated as \n\u2018failing\u2019 then usually the principal has to resign, irrespective of the extent to which other \nstaff may have failed to be exemplary followers. In England, the advent of the self-\nmanaging school over the last twenty years has further excerbated the over-expectations a \nleader. State school principals now have the dual roles of business and instructional \nleaders. If principals are to be saved from exhaustion, if we are to have more people \napplying for principalships, if we are to stop blaming one individual when a school fails, \nthen we must elevate the status and roles of the followers.   \n \nThis plea also recognises that followers provide a vital, psychological role in \norganizations. They represent the Jungian \u2018dark side\u2019 of leaders as their shadow \npersonalities, working \u2018on the issues that the leader...keeps hidden and cannot engage \ndirectly...the shadow includes those aspects of the personality that we want to hide or \ndisown\u2019 (Berg, 2001:9).  A leader, therefore, operates much more effectively when there \nis a follower (or followers) who can be the public opposite of the leader, can absorb \nopprobrium that might otherwise be directed at the leader and can take on roles that might \nhamper the freedom of movement of the leader. This reinforces Chaleff\u2019s view of \nfollowers as courageous - brave enough to tell leaders what may be unwelcome news \n(Chaleff, 1995).  \n \nMore prosaically, when all but leadership is denigrated, then organizations are in danger \nof not managing some of their basic needs. For example, advice to deputy principals or \nheads of departments, suggests that they should concentrate on leadership aspects such as \nstrategy and people management; they should eschew such maintenance tasks as \n\u2018checking stock levels, ordering for the next academic year, planning and finalising \ncourses, allocating students to groups, completing records and profiles and compiling \nlists\u2019 (Buckby, 1997, 25). So who, one wonders, is to do these - other, more lowly \nfollowers perhaps? \n \nDespite the denigation of followership tasks, research claims that followers account for \neighty per cent of an organization\u2019s success (Kelley, 1992:8) and that good leaders are \nmade by good followers (Johnson 1981; O\u2019Neill and Welland, 1986; Kouzes and Posner, \n1990: 29; Atwater et al 1995; Fullan, 1995:21; Allinson et al 1999). School principals \nwithout majority support are powerless to effect change (Mortimore, 1996: 261).    \n \nEven less generally realized is that good followers are made by their contacts with other \ngood followers irrespective of their leaders\u2019 attributes (Meindl, 1990). Wallace and Hall\u2019s \n1994 study of senior management teams (SMTs) in English secondary schools showed \nthat while the school principals decided what roles the team members should play, how \nthese worked out in practice depended on how colleagues reacted to each other and not to \nthe principals\u2019 intentions. In primary schools too, Wallace found that headteachers\u2019 \npowers to set an SMT\u2019s parameters were limited (2001, 161, 163). There is no evidence \n\u2018demonstrating stable and long-term effects of leaders on follower self-esteem, motives, \ndesires, preferences or values\u2019 (House and Aditya, 1997:443). All this underlines the need \nto comprehend effective followership. \n \nQuo vadis adsectator3?  \nThody\/Followership aricle\/9 \n  \n \nOther languages can extend our followership lexicon Latin, for example, offers the \npositive adsectator (companion), the neutral successor (heir) and stipator (attendant) and \nnegatives adsecula (servant, sycophant), pedisequus (lackey) and sectator (hanger on).  \nThe international conference audiences added more words from other languages. \nDeveloping empirical research will be easier now that the vocabulary of followership \noffers so many positive words with which research subjects might feel happy to ally \nthemselves and a range that shows that followers have as much personal choice as leaders \nin how they behave.  \n \n \nReferences \nAtwater, L., Roush, P. and Fischthal, A.
