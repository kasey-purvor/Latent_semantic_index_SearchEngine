ISBEE, as many will \nknow, aims to be a truly global association which draws together scholars and practitioners \nfrom all continents. In doing so, it helps to counter the kind of parochialism that is all too of-\nten a temptation \u2013 to work with others and write for others that share similar cultural assump-\ntions. South Africa in general, and Cape Town in particular, was a good venue to host such a \nconference with its history as a meeting place for the peoples of the world. \n \nThe title of the World Congress (sometimes referred to as the Olympics of Business Ethics \nconferences because it meets every four years) was \u201cGlobal Fairness \u2013 Local Integrity\u201d. We \nhave tried to reflect some of that diversity in the choice of papers for this Special Issue. Two \nof the papers are from African authors, two from North America, four from Europe and one \neach from Latin America and Asia. While attempting to attain this level of geographical di-\nversity we have also sought papers that were within our (admittedly broad) title for this Spe-\ncial Issue of \u201cGlobal and contextual values for business in a changing world\u201d. We have also \nensured that the normal quality standards expected of an internationally reputed journal such \nas the Journal of Business Ethics have been adhered to through the usual double-blind re-\nviewing process. We would like to take the opportunity to thank all of those who reviewed \npapers for us. \n \nThe content of the papers reflects the breadth of the discussions at the ISBEE World Con-\ngress. We begin with a reflective article by Georges Enderle in which he considers the con-\ncepts of wealth and wealth creation. As he argues, it is a topic which is often assumed in dis-\ncussions of business ethics \u2013 we are all for wealth creation, it\u201fs just how it\u201fs created that mat-\nters. But Enderle shows that the concept of wealth is a rich and varied one \u2013 that it includes \nphysical, financial, human and social capital wealth, takes both private and public forms, in-\nvolves a consideration of both wealth creation and distribution, and has both material and \nspiritual aspects. Sustainability is also an essential element of any serious consideration of \nwealth creation. Hence there are challenges here for business and business ethics in consider-\ning the purpose of business \u2013 what it is for \u2013 rather than just how it does it. \n \nNtibagirirwa Symphorien makes the argument that cultural values underpin the pursuit of \nself-interest and rational choice that have led to growth and development in western econo-\nmies. That these cultural values are fundamental to economic growth is often an unstated as-\nsumption, and such an assumption then leads to the simplistic conclusion that self-interest \nand rational choice can be universalised. In showing that this is not the case, he derives a \npowerful explanation for the failure of economic development in sub-Saharan Africa and, by \nconsidering shared African values, he argues for the development of an \u201cUbuntu economy\u201d \nwhich is true to Africa\u201fs cultural heritage. \n \nDavid Lutz\u2019s paper follows this and looks for a theory of global management which is con-\nsistent with the common human nature. He proposes the African Ubuntu philosophy of com-\nmunity orientation as the foundation for such a theory. He shows the differences in various \nUbuntu concepts and asks what it means for an Ubuntu style of management. The author also \nfinds similarities between Ubuntu philosophy, Confucianism and the Platonic-Aristotelian \nphilosophy. He also warns that nepotism and corruption can become the negative side of the \ncoin of Ubuntu. He shows an outline of a theory of global ethical management based on Ub-\nuntu philosophy. \n \nChristoph St\u00fcckelberger\u201fs paper has more direct practical implications. He considers the \nissue of dialogue and the ethical criteria and conditions for creating a successful dialogue be-\ntween corporate actors and their stakeholders. He sets the paper within the context of theories \nof dialogue, drawing on Habermas\u201f work for example, considers some practical examples to \nground the discussion, before offering a typology of dialogues. A consideration of the fun-\ndamental values that might be used to evaluate dialogues is followed by a discussion of the \nethics of compromise \u2013 so often an essential component of any dialogue between actors with \ndifferent objectives. The paper concludes with a set of conditions for ethical dialogue. \n \nRosa Chun compares the ethical values towards environmental responsibility of employees \nin state-owned and private companies in China. The case study with questionnaires in seven \nChinese companies in the energy sector concentrates not on the legal framework or manage-\nment decisions as most such studies do, but on employees\u201f attitude and behaviour. The re-\nsearch shows significantly lower corporate citizenship and environmental responsibility in \nstate-owned than in private companies. \n \nTill Talaulicar shows the tension between \u201cglobal and contextual values in business\u201d, in line \nwith the theme of this Special Issue, by analysing two legal disputes (Wal Mart and Honey-\nwell) on implementing U.S. codes of ethics in Germany. Workers rights are in the center of \nthe dispute. Global companies are confronted with competing legal systems in states of law. \nHow then can global standards and codes be implemented? The author analyses the compa-\nnies\u201f codes and proposes solutions for their contextualisation. \n \nThomas Maak challenges the mainstream view that companies are private institutions. He \nconsiders the multinational corporations as a political actors with respective responsibilities \nsuch as human rights and environmental and social justice. He refers to the ancient and mod-\nern concept of cosmopolitanism in its moral, legal, political and cultural dimension. As a \nconclusion he calls for the cosmopolitical corporation as a member of the global public \nsphere. Finally, he criticises the concept of corporations as governments, taking on the role of \npolitical governments. He shows the more participative concept of global corporate citizen-\nship in the global public sphere. \n \nM. Virginia Halter and Cecila Arruda describe and analyse the phenomenon of corrupt \npractices in the private sector in Brazil. Through field research they analyse the ethical be-\nhaviour of the purchasing department of a multinational company. A special focus is put on \nthe supplier-buyer relationship.  Transparency is seen as the key ethical value and communi-\ncation as a key tool to reduce corruption.  \n \nGeert Demuijnck presents a case study of Auchan, a large retail company in France and \nEurope. The company shifted over the decades from an implicit Christian catholic corporate \nculture to a concept of corporate ethical responsibility in more secular structures and justifi-\ncation schemes. Being personally involved, the author describes this development from \nwithin. The catholic value system and its implementation especially in the company\u201fs ethics \ncommittee is analysed. The articles closes with a typology of six scenarios of responsibility \nand lessons for further research \n \nFinally,the paper by Fred Bird, Thomas Vance and Peter Woolstencroft takes a \u201ebig pic-\nture\u201f perspective on fairness in international trade, focusing particularly on North America \n(Mexico, Canada and USA). They note four typical normative views of what represents fair-\nness in trade and, while acknowledging that any universal resolution between these views is \nunlikely, offer some common points of reference which might usefully be used to inform and \nhelp towards resolution in such debates. In particular, they focus on the way in which abusive \ntransfer pricing can distort international trade relations and suggest a possible mechanism for \nresolving this issue. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"}
