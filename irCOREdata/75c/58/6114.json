McAlpine et al. use the constructive\napproach to course delivery as a tool to interpret and analyse the \u2018designer as student\u2019\nexperience and perspective.\nIn \u2018Transactional distance in a blended learning environment\u2019, Dron et al. present\na case study that describes and discusses the problems encountered during the imple-\nmentation of a blended learning course, the design of which was based largely on\nMoore\u2019s theory of transactional distance (Moore & Kearsley, 1996). Dron et al. then\nuse Moore\u2019s theory, which focuses on the relationship between structure and\ndialogue, as a tool to understand the successes and failures of the course.\nSymbols as tools for representing successful implementation of learning technologies\nIn \u2018Implementing a learning technology strategy: top-down strategy meets bottom-up\nculture\u2019, Lisewski presents a case study which explores why the University of Salford\nhas adopted a Learning Technologies Strategy (LTS) and examines the factors which\nare likely to lead to its successful implementation. Part of this exploration focuses on\nthe explicit reference within the LTS to establishing a \u2018web presence\u2019 via a Virtual\nLearning Environment. Lisewski explores how \u2018web presence\u2019 might be used to\nsymbolize successful implementation of the LTS and argues that: \nThe term \u2018web presence\u2019 is the symbolic cultural mediator between the strategic goals of\nthe LTS and how these are translated into effective learning and teaching practice on the\nground. On the one hand, it seemingly offers flexibility and room for interpretation within\ndifferent cultural contexts but on the other may produce fear, anxiety and increased pres-\nsure on academic staff\nMetaphors as tools for describing and understanding networked learning\nIn \u2018Networks and learning: communities, practices and the metaphor of networks: a\ncommentary\u2019 and \u2018Networks and learning: communities, practices and the metaphor\nof networks: a response\u2019, Ingraham and Jones debate the usefulness of the network\nmetaphor in developing our understanding of online (networked) learning. Part of\nthis debate focuses on the extent to which the metaphor over-simplifies or compli-\ncates the issues.\n Editorial\n \n109\n             New tools for the job?\nThe use of concepts, theories, symbols and metaphors to explore learning technology\npractice is not new. What does change however, are the particular concepts, theories,\nsymbols and metaphors we choose to use in this exploration. This can be illustrated\nby considering the trends of theory use in learning technology. Five or more years ago,\nwhen collaboration, interaction, communication, discussion and dialogue were of\nmajor interest to practitioners and researchers, particular theories were predomi-\nnantly used as tools to explore how to promote these activities (e.g. Laurillard, 1993).\nIn more current times, the issue of \u2018community\u2019 is of particular interest and Wenger\u2019s\n(1998) \u2018Communities of Practice\u2019 theory is a popular tool for exploring current issues\nand concerns. For example, in a review of accessibility literature, Seale (2004) iden-\ntifies key issues that may influence the \u2018accessibility\u2019 practices of learning technolo-\ngists and interprets these issues using Wenger\u2019s theory of Communities of Practice.\nThe popularity of Wenger\u2019s theory as a tool for exploring practice is reflected in the\narticles presented in this issue of ALT-J. Four of the seven articles make reference to\nWenger (Conole & Dyke; Ellaway et al.; Dron et al.; Jones). Although Wenger\u2019s\ntheory was based on observations of claims processors in a US insurance company, it\nis perceived by many to have relevance, resonance and application to learning tech-\nnology. This is largely because the primary focus of his theory is on learning as social\nparticipation, which resonates with learning technologists\u2019 interests in collaboration\nand dialogue. For example, in this issue Ellaway et al. provide a rationale for why\nWengers\u2019 theory is relevant to the design of online learning environments: \nWenger\u2019s theories can be particularly relevant in modelling learning environments where\nthey encompass a pre-existing learning community of students, teachers\/tutors, support\nstaff and potentially many other roles and groups. Furthermore, any participant may adopt\nor change roles; students may be involved in teaching each other, teachers may become\nlearners, support and administration responsibilities may fall to different participants at\ndifferent times and so on. All of this activity is in turn informed by socio-cultural norms\nand values inherent in the practice and the related social contexts in which it is situated. If\nthis is the case then such a course may be modelled as a community of practice, and\nindeed, its component parts (such as modules of study or groupings such as \u2018students\u2019)\nmay themselves constitute subsidiary communities of practice.\nUseful tools for the job?\nWhilst learning technologists are comfortable using concepts, theories, symbols and\nmetaphors as tools to explore, evaluate, develop and understand their practice and\nexperience; there is a danger that the usefulness of these tools will not be routinely\ncritiqued. For example, \u2018Communities of Practice\u2019 has become so ubiquitous as a\nconceptual tool that few people are questioning its usefulness. There are, however,\nsome researchers who have identified some limitations of the theory. For example, in\nexploring the development of accessible e-learning materials, Seale (2003) acknowl-\nedges that Wenger\u2019s theory does not help to understand the more \u2018political\u2019 aspects\nof accessibility and disability rights. Therefore, if the tools we use are not regularly\n 110\n \nJ. Seale\n                critiqued and questioned, they may stifle rather than develop our understanding and\nthinking.\nIn discussing the metaphor of technology as a tool, Nardi and O\u2019Day (1999: 25)\nnote: \nBut it is important to recognize that all metaphors channel and limit our thinking, as well\nas bring in useful associations from other contexts. That is the purpose of a metaphor, after\nall-to steer is to think about the topic this way rather than some other way.\nThis is highlighted by Cousin (2002), who argues that the metaphor of the \u2018virtual\nclassroom\u2019 has been used to encourage learning technologists to replicate old, tradi-\ntional and conservative teaching practices rather than develop newer, more imagina-\ntive ones. She illustrates this with a discussion of the WebCT and Blackboard Virtual\nLearning Environments.\nIn this issue, the articles by Ingraham and Jones acknowledge the potential pitfall\nof using the network metaphor to steer thinking in a particular direction. Ingraham\npicks up on Jones\u2019 acknowledgement that the network metaphor can be value laden,\nwhich may serve to limit its usefulness in terms of expanding our understanding. If\nnetworks are understood as a set of nodes, then Ingraham is concerned that we will\nbe directed to only view a network in flat and two-dimensional terms, while Jones\nproposes further exploration of both the network and community metaphor: \nA specific grounded piece of research flowing from the network metaphor would be to\nexplore empirically the relations found in technologically assisted learning. The aim of\nsuch an exploration would be not to impose either the network or community metaphor,\nbut to provide descriptive accounts of the kinds of relationships that are found in such\nsettings and see in what ways if any either metaphor illuminated such descriptions.\nThe right tools for the job?\nIn their discussion of metaphors, Nardi and O\u2019Day (1999:27) emphasize the impor-\ntance of choosing the right tool for the job: \nUsing the tool metaphor to describe technology suggests several tactics to users. Before\nstarting work, it is important to choose the right tool for the job. There is a matching\nprocess in looking at the task in hand and deciding on the best tool for that task.\nThe challenge for the readers of this issue of ALT-J will be to assess whether the\nauthors of the papers have chosen the right tools for the jobs they have set themselves.\nFor example: \n\u0002 Will Conole and Dyke\u2019s proposed taxonomy of affordances enable practitioners to\nmake more informed choices about the ways in which different technologies can be\nused? Will it be flexible enough to incorporate or allow for \u2018extra\u2019, unanticipated\naffordances that may emerge during the use of ICT\u2019s?\n\u0002 In using the constructivist framework to analyse and interpret student experiences\nhave McAlpine et al. missed any significant points or issues? Would different, but\nequally plausible interpretations emerge if a different framework was used?\n Editorial\n \n111\n                         \u0002 In using Moore\u2019s theory of transactional distance have Dron et al. managed to\ncompletely understand why their course has not produced the anticipated\noutcomes? Would different, but equally plausible interpretations emerge if a differ-\nent theory were used?\nIn evaluating whether the right tools for the job have been chosen, we will need to\nconsider the context in which they are being used. As Ellaway et al., in this issue, note: \nThe approach presented here is one that is grounded in theory, is based around a holistic\nview of course-VLE instances and has provided significant utility to the authors in the eval-\nuation of their own work. \u2026 the level to which other users may find utility in this work may\ndepend on the degree of agreement and alignment in approach and philosophy with that\nof the authors, and the contexts they are working in.\nReferences\nCousin, G.
