Where growth does \noccur, agglomeration of silicon particles may play a large role, especially at higher liquid \ncontents.  Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) gives evidence of agglomeration, and \nfurthermore shows that high angle silicon-silicon boundaries are not wetted with liquid. \n \n 2 \n1 Introduction. \n \nHypereutectic aluminium-silicon alloys, with silicon contents well above the eutectic \ncomposition (12.2 wt.% Si), exhibit desirable physical properties such as high specific stiffness, \ngood wear resistance, low coefficient of thermal expansion, and low density [1].  This makes \nthese alloys interesting for many applications, not least in the automotive and aerospace \nindustries.  However, due to the steepness of the liquidus on the silicon-rich side of the eutectic, \nand the large latent heat associated with silicon freezing, the silicon precipitates slowly as large \n(up to several mm diameter), angular crystals.  This has deleterious effects on the mechanical \nproperties, especially the fracture toughness, and thus silicon contents are generally accepted to \nbe limited to about 18 wt.% in conventionally cast alloys.  A well-established method of refining \nthe primary silicon size in hypereutectic aluminium-silicon alloys is to inoculate the melt with a \nphosphorus-bearing addition [2,3]. However, due to the wide melting range in the far-\nhypereutectic region, this is not effective above about 25 wt.% silicon. \nAn alternative approach to refine the primary silicon particle size in these alloys is sprayforming \n[4], which results in homogeneous, fine-scale microstructures, with low levels of segregation.  \nHypereutectic Al-Si alloys manufactured by this route exhibit microstructures that are generally \nfree of eutectic silicon, but rather consist of equiaxed silicon particles approximately 1-10 \u00b5m in \ndiameter, embedded in a matrix of \u03b1-Al solid solution [5,6]. This non-equilibrium microstructure \nwould not be expected from a thermodynamic point of view for hypereutectic Al-Si alloys. The \nalloys can be considered to be, in effect, metal matrix composites, with the silicon essentially a \nparticulate reinforcing phase in the metal matrix [7].  A further benefit of the equiaxed nature of \nsprayformed materials is that they are amenable to shaping by semi-solid processing routes (of \nwhich thixoforming is one type).  Successful thixoforming requires a specific starting \nmicrostructure in the semi-solid state; namely discrete spheroids surrounded by a continuous \n 3 \nliquid film [8].  To obtain this microstructure in a commercially acceptable time frame, liquid has \nto form easily and be able to wet the majority of grain boundaries present.  Under these \nconditions, enhanced mechanical properties can be obtained relative to die casting, due to the \nsmooth laminar flow of the slurry in the die.  This reduces segregation, avoids gas entrapment \nwhich causes porosity, and, as the metal flow front is not broken up, oxide entrapment is much \nreduced.  Most commercial thixoforming is carried out at around 0.5 volume fraction liquid, \nmainly using aluminium alloys (a review of the aluminium alloys used for semi-solid processing \nhas been carried out by Atkinson et al. [9]), although semi-solid processing of magnesium alloys \nis commercially exploited in the form of thixomoulding [10].  Assuming that the feedstock has \nbeen produced correctly and careful control of the heating into the semi-solid region is observed, \nthixotropic flow is readily achieved.   \nIn the types of alloys used in this study, when the silicon content exceeds approximately 27 wt.%, \nthe silicon in the microstructure exists as a three-dimensional interconnected network [5]. This \nhinders thixoforming. The network has considerable strength, which along with a high proportion \nof unwetted grain boundaries, inhibits semi-solid processing, causing liquid segregation and \nincomplete die filling.  The aim of this investigation was to try and understand the evolution of \nthe microstructure (i.e. the kinetics of liquid formation and silicon coarsening) when the material \nwas heated into the semi-solid state and held at temperatures of 550\u00b0C, 555\u00b0C, 558\u00b0C and 562\u00b0C, \nwhich have already been shown [7] to be suitable for semi-solid processing of these materials. \nSprayformed and extruded Al-30Si-5Cu-2Mg alloy (all compositions are given in wt.%) was \nisothermally annealed in a specially designed induction furnace. For comparison, heat treatments \nwere also performed in the solid state (495\u00b0C) for 1, 2, 4 and 8 hours. \n \n2 Experimental method and materials \nThe Al-Si-Cu-Mg alloy was sprayformed by Osprey Metals Ltd. and extruded at Minalex at \n330\u00b0C.  This was carried out to reduce the cross-section of the alloy to a more suitable size.  \n 4 \nExtrusion of the sprayformed billets proved difficult; at the maximum force available the \nextrusion speed was approximately 0.07mm\/s.  The final diameter of the bar was 72mm, with the \nextrusion ratio approximately 4.5.  The actual composition was 32.6 Si, 4.52 Cu, 1.67 Mg (wt.%).  \nThe residual Fe content was 0.18 wt.%.  Isothermal heat-treatments were performed on \ncylindrical samples (12.5mm in diameter and 40mm in height) using a small 5kW radio \nfrequency (approximately 450kHz) induction furnace.  A Eurotherm 2404 P.I.D. (Proportional, \nIntegral, Derivative) controller was interfaced to the induction heater to maintain close \ntemperature control (to within +0.5\u02daC). Although the temperatures selected for the isothermal \nannealing treatments are close to each other, the consistent differences in behaviour between the \ndifferent temperatures, which will be demonstrated below, provide evidence that the temperature \ncontrol does occur to within these limits.  The samples were held horizontally inside a silica tube, \nwithin the induction coil, on a small silica boat to position them centrally in the coil.  Quenching, \nto arrest microstructural development, was carried out by pouring water in via a side arm.  \nSamples were isothermally heat-treated at 495\u00b0C for 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours, and at temperatures \nsuitable for thixoforming of  550, 555, 558 and 562\u00b0C for 5 minutes to 8 hours.  The 495\u00b0C heat \ntreatment is approximately 10\u00b0C below the solidus temperature. The other temperatures are in the \nsolid-plus-liquid region, but, as will be shown later, the liquid fraction evolved gradually with \ntime, and so a unique fraction solid cannot be attributed to each temperature.  After heat treatment \nand quenching, sections were prepared for metallography in the usual manner.  Optical \nmicroscopy was performed on unetched samples using an Olympus Vanox microscope and \nimages captured using a JVC KK-F55B CCD camera driven by Neotech Image Grabber PCI \nsoftware.  Image analysis was carried out using commercially available image analysis software. \nDifferential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) was carried out using a TA Instruments 910 with \ncarbon pans (as the sample reacted with the standard aluminium pans), calibrated by melting \nindium and lead at the relevant heating rate.  The heating rate was 40 K\/min. Electron backscatter \n 5 \ndiffraction (carried out at Oxford University Materials Department) was performed using a JEOL \n6500 FEG-SEM with TSL OIM data collection and analysis software. \n \n3 Results and discussion  \n3.1 Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) \nFigure 1 shows the DSC trace obtained on heating to 562\u00b0C, using a heating rate of 40\u00b0C \/minute.  \nThis was the fastest heating rate the machine was calibrated for, and of a similar rate to that \nexperienced during heating in the induction furnace.  The endotherm beginning at around 508\u00b0C \nprobably corresponds to the quaternary Al-Si-Al2Cu-Al5Si6Cu2Mg8 (Al-Si-\u03b8-Q) eutectic.  This is \nin reasonable agreement with literature values [11].  There is a progressive decline in the base \nline after the first endotherm, most likely resulting from dissolution of silicon and other elements \ninto the aluminium as the solid-solubility increases with temperature.  The inflection which is \narrowed at approximately 525\u00b0C is consistent with the Al-Si-Al2Cu (Al-Si-\u03b8) ternary eutectic \nreaction [11].  The endotherm at approximately 540-545\u00b0C probably corresponds to the Al-Q \nbinary (at 540\u00b0C) or Al-\u03b8 binary (at 548\u00b0C).  A further endotherm is evident at around 560\u00b0C, \nwhich may be due to the binary Al-Si eutectic reaction.  It should be noted that, as will be shown \nbelow, the binary eutectic reaction has very sluggish kinetics, and this will affect the DSC results.  \n  \n3.2 Microstructural evolution \nFigures 2 to 5 show the chronological development of the alloy microstructure on heat treatment \nat 550\u00b0C, 555\u00b0C, 558\u00b0C and 562\u00b0C for 5, 15, 30, 60, 120 and 480 minutes.  The lightest phase is \nthe aluminium-solid solution, the dark grey phase is the silicon, and the mid-grey phase is the \nquenched liquid.  The black regions are not the Mg2Si phase, but probably regions where the \nquenched liquid has been pulled out during polishing.  Note here that the magnifications are \ndifferent, especially at the increased temperatures, but micron markers are included. \n 6 \nFigure 2 shows the observed microstructures on isothermal holding for up to 8 hours at 550\u00b0C.  \nHere it is apparent that the silicon is coarsening progressively, and that the liquid content is \nslowly increasing with time at temperature, from approximately 5% to 14% (from image \nanalysis) between the 5 minutes and 8 hours heat treatment.  The liquid is not completely \nsurrounding the silicon; there are many grain boundaries not wetted by liquid at all holding times.  \nFigure 6 shows the microstructure of the alloy soaked for 5 minutes and 8 hours at 550\u00b0C at \nhigher magnification to confirm this observation.  It is clear that after 8 hours the aluminium \nspheroids have remained intact and there is only a small amount of quenched liquid present, \nindicating that the binary eutectic reaction has not commenced to any significant degree. \n \nFigure 3 shows the observed microstructures on isothermal holding for up to 8 hours at 555\u00b0C.  \nBetween 5 minutes and 60 minutes (same magnification), the silicon is coarsening progressively \nand the liquid contents are similar (6 and 9% respectively).  However, there is a large increase in \nthe liquid content between 5 minutes and 8 hours \u2013 Figure 7.  There is evidence of fine \naluminium dendrites from the quenched liquid at a holding time of 8 hours suggesting the onset \nof the binary eutectic reaction.  This variation in liquid content with time is greater as the \ntemperature is increased, and is quantified in Table 1.  The liquid content from image analysis \nwas higher as the temperature increased, but remained reasonably constant between 5 minutes \nand 60 minutes at each temperature. At 120 minutes and above, for the heat treatments at 555, \n558 and 562\u00b0C, the liquid content increased considerably with time. \n \nFigure 8 illustrates the observed microstructures after holding for 8 hours at 558 and 562\u00b0C \nrespectively.  The microstructure consists of silicon + quenched liquid.  Especially apparent at \nhigher temperatures and times is agglomeration of the silicon, evidenced by a \u2018branched\u2019 or non-\nequiaxed silicon morphology.  Furthermore, entrapped liquid within the particles suggests that \nagglomeration of the silicon has taken place. \n 7 \n \n \n3.3 Rate constants for the coarsening of the silicon \nFigure 9 graphically illustrates the coarsening data. For the shorter times and lower temperatures, \nthousands of particles have been analysed, for the higher times and longer temperatures, \nhundreds. The 95% confidence limits are shown. It is clear that, for a given time, the average \nsilicon size generally becomes larger as the isothermal holding temperature is increased.  A \nsteady reduction in the rate of increase with time was observed in the samples held at 550\u00b0C.  At \n555, 558 and 562\u00b0C, the particle growth rate declined between 5 minutes and 60 minutes (figure \n9 insert).  However, the growth rate increased between 60 minutes and 120 minutes, decreased \nbetween 120 and 240 minutes and increased between 240 and 480 minutes.  The erratic nature of \nthe variation in rate of particle size increase is attributed to the differences in liquid contents with \ntime (Table 1). Table 1 indicates that at 550\u00b0C the liquid content increases only slightly with \ntime, whereas the higher annealing temperatures produce appreciably increased liquid with time.  \n \nTo compare with data in the literature we need to obtain a coarsening rate constant.  \nExperimentally observed coarsening in the semi-solid state (even at high solid fractions) [12], is \nusually treated in terms of cubic kinetics (diffusion controlled coarsening) and this will be \nassumed to be the case here.  Furthermore, a statistical analysis of concurrent diffusion controlled \ncoarsening and grain coalescence [13] has shown that cubic kinetics is still applicable, with the \ncoarsening rates depending on the relative contributions of the two mechanisms.   \nFigure 10 shows a silicon coarsening plot assuming cubic kinetics, i.e.  \nd3 = do3 + Kt   (1)   \nwhere d is the average particle diameter at time t, do is the initial average particle diameter and K \nis the coarsening rate constant.  For the higher temperature heat treatments, the data do not lie on \na straight line across the entire time range.  Table 2 shows the observed semi-solid coarsening \n 8 \nrate constants, K, assuming a linear fit over the entire range of times, with regression coefficients.  \nThe coarsening rate constants in the semi-solid state are very sensitive to temperature, with an \napproximate order of magnitude increase per few \u00b0C. \n \nFigure 10 (insert) illustrates a magnification of the cube of the average silicon diameter vs. time \nbetween 5 and 60 minutes.  For this range of times, the curves exhibit a reasonable fit to the cubic \npower law model.  The coarsening rate constants, K5-60, for heat treatment times between 5 \nminutes and 60 minutes were obtained from the linear best-fit lines and are also shown in Table \n2.  K5-60 values increase by approximately a factor of five between the 550\u00b0C and 562\u00b0C \nannealing temperatures.  It is evident from the microstructures (Figures 2 \u2013 5) that the liquid \ncontent of the samples (Table 1), although higher as the temperature was increased, remained \nreasonably constant between 5 minutes and 60 minutes.  At 120 minutes and above, for the heat \ntreatments at 555, 558 and 562\u00b0C, the liquid content increased considerably with time at \ntemperature, consistent with the larger coarsening constant, and large increase in the coarsening \nconstant over the entire range of annealing times. \n \nTypical coarsening rates for various sprayformed metal alloys, including AA2014, Cu-Ti, In-625 \n[12], UDIMET 720, MAR-M-002 [14] and IN718 [15], are in the region of 1 x 10-16  m3s-1.  This \nis some orders of magnitude faster than the results of this study, suggesting coarsening of the \nsilicon in this system is inhibited relative to other sprayformed metal systems. \n \nDue to the high fractions of solid present in the semi-solid state in this system, rather than \nconsidering the diffusion fields around isolated particles (as in the LSW analysis [16,17]), a \nmodified liquid film migration model [15], which considers migration of the liquid films \nseparating the grains, is used to predict the coarsening coefficient: \n \n 9 \nt\n)1f)(f-)RT(1C-2(C\n)f-(1 CV\u03b33D\nrr 3\/1\nsososl\nslm3\n0\n3\nt\n\u2212\n=\u2212\n\u2212\n, or  t'Krr\n3\n0\n3\nt =\u2212     (2) \nwhere, 0r  and tr  are the average particle radius initially and at time t respectively, D is the \ndiffusion coefficient, \u03b3 is the interfacial free energy in the solid-state, Vm is the molar volume of \nthe coarsening component, Cl and Cs are the concentration of solute in the liquid and solid \nrespectively, fs is the solid fraction (which in this study varies as a function of time at temperature \n- Table 1) and fso is the solid fraction where solid-solid contacts occur, i.e. the liquid thickness \nremains constant, but the area of contact is reduced.  R and T have their usual meanings.  Note \nthat, to facilitate direct comparison with values in the literature e.g. [12, 15, 18], the \nexperimentally obtained coarsening coefficients (K) were calculated using Ktdd\n3\n0\n3\nt =\u2212 .  The \npredicted K\u2019 value in Eq. 2 and below in Eq. 3 are equal to one eighth this value.  In the text and \nin the Tables, all predicted coarsening coefficients are stated in terms of K, i.e. 8K\u2019. \n \nAs silicon is essentially pure in the Al-Si system [19], and the concentration of solute in the solid \nsilicon is in effect zero, (Cl\/(Cl-Cs)) \u2192 1, and can therefore be neglected.  If we assume that the \ngrain boundaries of silicon are not wet by the liquid, which appears to hold true in this alloy, we \ncan take fso ~ 0.7 (the maximum packing for spheres).  This model predicts an increase in the \ncoarsening rate with increased liquid content in the high solid fraction regime, where the solid is \nnot separated by continuous liquid films (above ~ 0.7), consistent with observations here.   \n \nFor fractions of solid that are less than 0.7, i.e. the 120, 240 and 480 minutes treatment at 562\u00b0C, \nand the 480 minutes treatment at 558\u00b0C, the silicon particles are not in contact, and the liquid \nfilm migration model takes the form [15]: \n \n)1f()RTC-2(C\ntCV\u03b33Drr 3\/1\nsl\nlm3\n0\n3\nt\n\u2212\n=\u2212\n\u2212\ns\n    (3) \n 10 \n \nA benefit of using these models is that it allows us to illustrate the effect of liquid fraction on the \npredicted coarsening coefficient.  The data used to predict the coarsening parameter is given in \nTable 3. The predicted K values in the semi-solid state as a function of temperature and solid \nfraction, using the relevant model above, along with the fraction solid established using image \nanalysis, are presented in Table 4. \n \nIn the semi-solid state, the predicted values are higher than those obtained experimentally, even \nthough the effect of the high fraction of solid has been considered.  Initially there is very little \nliquid, and the coarsening species must be transported through the solid matrix or along grain \nboundaries (slow diffusion paths relative to diffusion in the liquid), or through any liquid \nchannels that might connect the silicon, and this effect may not be entirely accounted for by the \nmodel.  Coarsening may be inhibited if there are minority insoluble second phase particles \n(dispersoids or precipitates) located at grain boundaries, which pin the boundaries and\/or the \nmigrating liquid film [12].  These become ineffective as the temperature is increased when they \neither dissolve, or the liquid film thickness becomes greater than the particle size.  This could \ngive rise to the observed increase in K with increased temperature [12, 14] at low fractions of \nsolid.  This appears not to be the case in this study, as TEM including EDX of the sprayformed \nmaterial, failed to reveal the presence of an impurity second phase at grain boundaries within the \nlimit of the elements scanned (Al, Si, Cu and Mg) [21], although aluminium precipitates have \nbeen seen at, or close to, silicon-silicon grain boundaries [22].  Additional considerations of \nsluggish kinetics will be discussed below.  The predicted K values vary by less than an order of \nmagnitude across the entire temperature and solid fraction range, rather than by an order of \nmagnitude every few \u00b0C as observed experimentally in this study.  This will be discussed later in \nterms of the contribution of agglomeration of the silicon particles to the growth rate. \n \n 11 \n3.2 Kinetic considerations in connection with silicon surfaces \n \nA possible reason for the slow liquid formation and inhibited coarsening relative to metal systems \nis given by considering the free energy change consequent with the addition or loss of atoms from \na silicon surface.  The change in free energy as a monolayer is added or removed from a \ncrystallographically perfect crystal surface can be obtained using the model by Jackson [23].  \nAccording to the model, for silicon in contact with molten silicon, the {111} surfaces will be \nfaceted (\u03b1 \u2265 2) whereas the other surfaces should be atomically diffuse.  For silicon growing \nfrom liquid at the eutectic temperature, rather than from its pure melt at approximately 1414\u00b0C, \nthe faceting effect is emphasised [24], presumably as the entropy change will be larger for the \nmore ordered silicon atomic array at the lower temperature, and the Al-Si liquid will be more \ndisordered than pure Si liquid.  Both the {111} and {100} surfaces should be atomically smooth.  \nThe increase in free energy as the {111}, and to a lesser extent the {100}, surfaces proceed from \natomically smooth to atomically rough may be the cause of the sluggish kinetics at the \nsolid\/liquid interface, and therefore slow coarsening and liquid formation. \n \n3.3 Contribution to growth rate from agglomeration. \nAt higher temperatures and after long isothermal holding times, where there is a lower fraction of \nsolid, there is evidence that agglomeration of particles plays a role in the growth of the primary \nsilicon.  It is evident from the graphs of silicon particle size vs. time that the coarsening rate \nincreases in the low fraction solid regime, e.g. for the alloys heat treated at 558 and 562\u00b0C from \n120 to 480 minutes.  This increased growth rate may be due to growth from agglomeration.  \nFurthermore, the K values increase with increasing temperature (despite greater diffusion \ndistances), which is contrary to the model used here (eqs. 2 and 3) and LSW theory [16,17], but \nagain, consistent with a contribution to particle growth from agglomeration.  There is \nmicrostructural evidence for agglomeration; the non-equiaxed silicon morphology and increased \n 12 \nentrapped liquid within the primary silicon - Figure 8.  Under certain growth conditions (large \nsilicon particle size > 50\u03bcm and low undercooling) silicon can adopt a branched morphology, due \nto dendritic out-growths at corners and edges [25].  To investigate whether the branched \nmorphology of the silicon was due to agglomeration, or due to the growth under the condition \ndescribed as 3rd stage growth in ref [25], electron backscatter diffraction was performed.  Figure \n11(a) shows an EBSD pattern image quality map of a typical large silicon particle from the \nsample heat-treated at 562\u00b0C for 2 hrs.  Light regions in the map are from regions with few lattice \ndefects.  Grain boundaries are regions with a high proportion of defects and show as dark.  The \nvariations in the grey-scale in different areas in the particle are a consequence of the different \ncrystal orientations.  The particle consists of a large central grain, with several smaller grains \ncontained within it and attached to it.  There is evidence of the agglomeration process, with \nseparate grains attached by high angle boundaries (>15\u00b0) at the facets, rather than at corners.  \nHigh angle boundaries are shown as black lines and 59-61\u00b0 boundaries (corresponding to \u03a33 \n{111} twin boundaries) as light grey lines in Figure 11(b), which is for the same area as 11(a) and \nindicates regions of high silicon EDS counts as light.  The particle exhibits faceting on the {111} \nplanes (planes parallel to \u03a33 {111} twin boundaries, marked by thin grey lines in the figure), as \npredicted by the Jackson model.  There is evidence that the growth mechanism (other than \nagglomeration) is the twin plane re-entrant (TPRE) mechanism [26, 27], with twin grooves and \nledges present.   \n \nAgglomeration will occur if \u03b3gb \u2264 2\u03b3sl, where \u03b3gb and \u03b3sl are the grain boundary energy and \nsolid\/liquid interface energy respectively [28].  Dihedral angle studies for liquid eutectic Al-Si \nagainst solid silicon-silicon boundaries at 580\u00b0C [29] and 577\u00b0C [30], revealed the grain \nboundary energy to be equal to the solid\/liquid interface energy, i.e. the dihedral angle was \n~120\u00b0.  Taking the energy of high angle silicon-silicon boundaries to be 1.3-1.37 Jm-2, as \nobtained from computer simulations of high angle twist boundaries [31, 32], and the solid\/liquid \n 13 \ninterface energy to be approximately 0.5 Jm-2 (calculated from [30], corrected with a liquidus \nslope of 2350K\/atom fraction from [19]), this suggests such boundaries will be wetted by liquid \n(\u03b3gb > 2\u03b3sl).  For agglomeration to occur, these high angle boundaries will need to be favourably \norientated to a low energy configuration, or have their energy lowered by some other mechanism.  \nMonte Carlo simulations of a \u03a331 {111}-plane boundary predict the energy to be 0.86 Jm-2 [31], \nin which case a single boundary of this geometry will be energetically favoured over two solid-\nliquid interfaces.  In a \u03a331 boundary, 1 in 31 of the lattice sites coincide.  This is a reasonable \napproximation to a random boundary [33], i.e. the boundary ceases to exhibit \u2018special\u2019 properties.  \nTherefore, {111} plane high angle boundaries in silicon should all be around this energy.  \nSelected area electron diffraction [11] and EBSD have shown that the silicon in this system \nexhibits facets extensively on the (low energy [31, 34]) {111} plane (as predicted by the Jackson \nmodel mentioned above).  A large proportion of agglomeration boundary planes will, therefore, \nprobably be of the {111} type, leading to a high probability that agglomeration will occur.  \nAdditionally, there is evidence in the literature of agglomeration of primary silicon particles in \nAl-Si alloys [35, 36], and that silicon boundaries, generally, have a tendency to adopt special, low \nenergy, geometries [37, 38].   \n \n4 Conclusions \n \nThe microstructural evolution of a sprayformed and extruded Al-30Si-5Cu-2Mg alloy has been \ninvestigated at 495, 550, 555, 558, and 562\u00b0C.  During isothermal annealing in the semi-solid \nstate, the liquid content generally increased with time, but slowly. \n \nExperimentally obtained K values for the coarsening of silicon, assuming cubic coarsening \nkinetics, are several orders of magnitude lower than those typically obtained for sprayformed \n 14 \nmetal systems.  The K values increase with temperature by approximately an order of magnitude \nper few \u00b0C.  Apart from the 495\u00b0C and 550\u00b0C heat treatments, the rate of increase in particle size \ndoes not decrease with time, but varies erratically.  This is probably due to effects associated with \nchanges in the liquid content with time at temperature.   \n \nPredicted values of the coarsening coefficient are considerably higher than those obtained in the \nsemi-solid state. This is probably associated with sluggish kinetics at the solid\/liquid interface. \n \nThere is an observed acceleration in the coarsening rate at increased fraction liquid, despite \nincreases in diffusion distances.  We would argue that the higher growth rate at higher \ntemperatures is associated with agglomeration, and EBSD has revealed that agglomeration of \nsilicon does occur even when the grains are oriented to give high angle boundaries between \nagglomerated particles.  Particles can move more freely within the increased liquid allowing them \nto minimise their misorientation (if necessary) and collide.  Agglomeration may be further \nencouraged by the faceted nature of the boundaries which may result in lower energy \nagglomeration boundaries.   \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThe authors are grateful to Osprey Metals Ltd.
