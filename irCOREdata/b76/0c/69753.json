Generally, phase\nsynchronization is a phenomenon that can occur in any\ncombination of self-sustained oscillators due to a weak in-\nteraction between their phases or frequencies. There have\nalready been many studies of cardio-respiratory synchro-\nnization (CRS), not only for subjects at rest [3,4,7] but\nPublished in EPJ B 65, 425-433 (2008).\n2 D. A. Kenwright et al.: The effect of low-frequency oscillations on cardio-respiratory synchronization\nalso e.g. during paced respiration [6,8] and anaesthesia [9\u2013\n11], which have revealed that synchronization does occur,\nbut only as short epochs in the case of conscious subjects\nat rest. Toledo et al. [12] confirmed that synchronization\nis a real cardio-respiratory phenomenon, and not just an\nartifact.\nAlthough the functional role and precise physiological\nbasis of cardio-respiratory interactions are still being re-\nvealed [13], it has been shown that this interaction changes\nbetween different states, such as during an\u00e6sthesia [14].\nPhase-transition-like phenomena in synchronization have\nbeen shown to occur in rats as their depth of an\u00e6sthe-\nsia varies [9]. Furthermore, experiments such as [4,7], in\nwhich synchronization in resting subjects is more pro-\nnounced in athletes [7] than in non-athletes [4], may imply\nthat synchronization analysis can give useful information\nabout the health of an individual. The complete lack of\nsynchronization in a critically ill coma patient [5] is con-\nsistent with this idea. More importantly, subsystems can\ngo through changes even in an apparently steady state.\nThe transitions between different orders of synchroniza-\ntion can potentially yield information about the couplings\nand their evolution with time. However, to our knowledge,\nthe underlying mechanisms of transition have not yet been\ninvestigated.\nIn this paper, we show that even during a steady state,\nsuch as in repose, cardio-respiratory phase transitions ex-\nist and changes occur between close orders of synchro-\nnization ratios. Exercise not only perturbs the oscillators\nbut also their interactions, which manifest as a tempo-\nrary reduction in synchronization. The cardiac and respi-\nratory frequencies were extracted from ECG and respira-\ntion signals by use of the marked events [4]. The anal-\nysis was based on the phase dynamics approach intro-\nduced by Kuramoto [15] and its subsequent applications\nto synchronization analysis [2\u20134,16,17].We use the cardio-\nrespiratory synchrogram to provide an illustration of re-\ngions of phase synchronization, and synchronization in-\ndices to test the apparent synchronization epochs and\ntheir transitions. Wavelet analysis is then used to deter-\nmine the lower frequency components modulating the car-\ndiac and respiratory frequencies, and their associated en-\nergies [18]. Finally, using a phase-coupled model with low-\nfrequency noise, we show that synchronization transitions\nare mainly due to the presence of low-frequency fluctua-\ntions resulting from the activity of lower frequency oscil-\nlatory components.\n2 Data Collection\n2.1 Subjects\nSignals were obtained from 10 healthy volunteers, aged\n20-30 years. The procedure was explained to each subject\nand written consent was obtained. All were requested not\nto eat or drink caffeine-containing drinks at least 2 hours\nbefore the time of the measurements, and not to drink\nalcohol from the night before.\n2.2 The experiment\nSignals were recorded simultaneously using non-invasive\nsensors. The cardiac signal was obtained from a 3 lead\nECG system, and the respiration signal by means of a\npiezo-resistive sensor attached to a fabric strap placed\naround the thorax, and both were stored after passage\nthrough a signal conditioning unit (Cardiosignals, Joz\u02c7ef\nStefan Institute, Ljubljana, Slovenia). Initially, the volun-\nteers lay down on a bed in a relaxed position and signals\nwere recorded for 30 minutes at rest (RE). Subjects then\nimmediately moved to a semi-recumbent exercise bike (Vi-\nsion, R2100) and performed exercise (EX) at approxi-\nmately 60 rpm. They were asked to approximately main-\ntain this velocity by monitoring the LCD display of the\nD. A. Kenwright et al.: The effect of low-frequency oscillations on cardio-respiratory synchronization 3\nbike. A constant effort was set at 50 Watts, maintained\nautomatically to compensate for changes in the pedalling\nrpm.\nMovement artifacts in the signals were reduced by us-\ning the back rest on the bike to keep the upper body\nas still as possible for the duration of the exercise. Ex-\nercise continued for 30 minutes, and signals were recorded\nthroughout. The subjects then moved back to the bed\nand signals were recorded for a further 30 minutes af-\nter exercise (AE). There was a \u223c1-2 minute interval be-\ntween the different states, whereupon recording was in-\nterrupted, however, neither ECG electrodes nor the res-\npiration sensor were removed during this time to ensure\nthey remained in the same positions. The tension in the\nrespiratory belt usually had to be adjusted to allow for\nthe deeper breathing associated with exercise, and subse-\nquently for the shallower breathing afterwards. This was\ncalibrated before recording recommenced.\n2.3 Recordings\nThe sampling frequency for the simultaneous measure-\nments was 400 Hz. To remove noise artifacts a moving\naverage filter was applied to both signals, allowing isola-\ntion of the required frequency regions for observation.\n2.4 Instantaneous frequencies\nR-R intervals in the ECG were used as markers for the\nphase of the heart. As the respiration belt effectively mea-\nsured the changes in volume of the thorax, a sine-like pat-\ntern was produced, and maxima were used as event mark-\ners for respiratory cycles. The time for one cycle of each\noscillator was taken as the time between two consecutive\npeaks. From this, the instantaneous frequencies of both\nsignals were calculated f(tk) =\n1\ntk+1\u2212tk\nwhere tk is the\ntime of the kth peak.\n3 Methods of investigation\n3.1 Synchronization analysis\nGenerally, synchronization can be seen as the appearance\nof a relationship between the states of two interacting sys-\ntems. This can be manifested as phase locking which, for\nnonlinear oscillations, is given by |n\u03c61\u2212m\u03c62\u2212 \u03b4| < const\nwhere n andm are both integers, \u03c61 and \u03c62 are the phases\nof the oscillators, and \u03b4 is some average phase shift. The\nrhythms are said to be n:m locked when n periods of one\noscillator have exactly the same interval as m periods of\nthe second oscillator. The frequency ratio of the two os-\ncillators gives a good indication of possible intervals of\nsynchronization; even when the instantaneous frequencies\nof the two systems seem strongly variable, it is possible\nthat the two may be fluctuating together, which would be\napparent if their ratio around that time was constant.\n3.1.1 The cardio-respiratory synchrogram\nThe cardio-respiratory synchrogram (or phase stroboscope)\nis a visual tool that may be used for detecting periods of\nsynchronization between heart rhythm and respiration [3,\n2]. The synchrogram is created such that one observes the\nphase of one oscillator not just periodically in time, but\nrelative to the actual cycle of the other (slower) oscillator.\nIf these times are denoted tk, and the value at this time\nis \u03b8 = \u03c61(tk)mod 2\u03c0, a synchrogram can be produced by\nplotting \u03a8(tk) vs tk, where\n\u03a8(tk) =\n1\n2\u03c0\n\u03c61(tk)mod 2\u03c0. (1)\nFor perfect noiseless n:m synchronization, \u03a8(tk) attains a\nfixed value of \u03b8 for m respiratory cycles. Hence the syn-\nchrogram will produce n horizontal lines that can gener-\nally be identified visually.\n4 D. A. Kenwright et al.: The effect of low-frequency oscillations on cardio-respiratory synchronization\n3.1.2 Synchronization indices\nWe calculated \u03a8n,m = \u03c6n,m mod 2\u03c0, the normalized rel-\native phase, directly from the measured data, exploiting\nthe fact that both signals contain sharp peaks that clearly\nmark the instantaneous cycles. The instantaneous phase\nis then\n\u03c6(t) = 2\u03c0\nt\u2212 tk\ntk + 1\u2212 tk + 2\u03c0k, tk \u2264 t < tk+1, (2)\nwhere tk is the time of the kth marker event. The dis-\ntribution of \u03a8n,m is then a \u03b4 function, smeared in the\npresence of noise. Since in noisy systems phase synchro-\nnization can be understood in a statistical sense as the\nexistence of preferred values of generalized phase differ-\nence, measures based on quantifying the distribution of\nphases \u03b7 = \u03c62 mod 2\u03c0n|\u03c61 mod 2pim were proposed. We\nuse an index based on conditional probability which was\nintroduced in [16] and was shown to facilitate reliable de-\ntection of synchronous epochs of different order n:m [19,\n6]. Accordingly, the phase of the second oscillator is ob-\nserved at fixed values of the phase of the first oscillator,\n\u03b8. The interval of each phase \u03c61 and \u03c62, [0, 2\u03c0m) and\n[0, 2\u03c0n) respectively, is divided into N bins. The values of\n\u03c61 mod 2\u03c0m that belong to bin l are denoted as \u03b8l, while\nthe number of points inside this bin is denoted asMl, and\nMl values of \u03b7j,l, j = 1, . . . ,Ml, are calculated. If there is\nno synchronization between the oscillators, a uniform dis-\ntribution of \u03b7j,l can be expected on the interval [0, 2\u03c0n),\nor else it clusters around a certain value resulting in a uni-\nmodal distribution. Hence, for each bin the distribution is\nquantified as rl(tk) =\n1\nMl\n\u2211Ml(tk)\nj=1 e\nj\u03c62(tj) for each j when\n\u03c61(tj) belongs to the lth bin and tk\u2212tp\/2 \u2264 tj < tk+tp\/2.\nMl(tk) is the number of points in this bin at the kth in-\nstant. An average over 6 periods for 1:n, and 8 periods for\n2:n, tp, of the slower oscillator was used. Where the phases\nare completely locked, or completely unlocked we obtain\n|rl(tk)| = 1 or |rl(tk)| = 0, respectively. To improve relia-\nbility, we also calculate the average over all bins and obtain\nthe index of synchronization \u03bbn,m(tk) =\n1\nN\n\u2211N\nl=1 |rl(tk)|.\nAccordingly, \u03bbn,m is a measure of the conditional prob-\nability that \u03c62 has a certain value within the lth bin when\n\u03c61 belongs to this bin. Synchronization can occur in sev-\neral regimes, switching from one index to another with\ntime. The indices are found by trial and error, although\na good indication of where the regimes occur can be ob-\ntained from the frequency ratio of the two oscillators. A\nfrequency ratio of f1f2 = 4 would indicate m:n indices of\n1:4. As we mentioned before, perfect synchronization ap-\npears when the value of the index = 1, and is zero when\nthere is no synchronization. However, in a noisy system\nsuch as with cardio-respiratory interactions, perfect syn-\nchronization is rarely seen. Hence a high index value close\nto 1 is used as an indication of synchronization. For this\ninvestigation, only values above 0.95 were considered (i.e.\nwithin 5% of perfect synchronization). We sum all the in-\ntervals during which the indices meet these criteria and\nrefer to the result as the synchronization time.\n3.2 Time-frequency analysis using wavelet transform\nFrequency analysis can give information about the sig-\nnals modulating a rhythm. Whereas Fourier analysis gives\ngood frequency information for a stationary signal, a broad-\nening of peaks is seen if the signal is time variant, as with\nrespiratory and cardiac signals. Also, there is a trade-off\nbetween frequency and localization resolution, as governed\nby the uncertainty principle. Wavelet analysis provides fre-\nquency component information of a signal with time. We\nuse a Morlet mother wavelet as it is a Gaussian function\nand allows for the best time-frequency localization the un-\ncertainty principle will allow. There is also a straightfor-\nward inverse relationship between frequency and the scale\nf = 1\/s. A Morlet mother waveform is given by\n\u03c8(u) =\n1\n4\n\u221a\n\u03c0\ne\u2212i2pif0u \u00b7 e\u2212u2\/2. (3)\nD. A. Kenwright et al.: The effect of low-frequency oscillations on cardio-respiratory synchronization 5\nThis is scaled (stretched and compressed) by some factor s\n\u03a8s,t = |s|\u2212p \u00b7 \u03c8(u \u2212 t\ns\n) (4)\nto create wavelets that are compared in time to the orig-\ninal signal (p = \u22121). The wavelet transform is a convolu-\ntion of the wavelet and the time series\ng\u02dc(s, t) =\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\u03a8\u00afs,t \u00b7 g(u)du. (5)\nHence, for every wavelet at each moment in time a coeffi-\ncient is obtained, representing the strength of correlation\nbetween wavelet and original signal. Thus a high coeffi-\ncient for a small-scale wavelet at a given moment in time\ncorresponds to the presence of a high frequency compo-\nnent at that time.\nThe total energy of the signal can be calculated as\n\u2016g\u20162 = C\u22121\n\u222b \u222b\n\u211c2\n|s|2p\u22123|g\u02dc(s, t)|2dsdt, (6)\nwhere the constant C is determined by the shape of the\nwavelet. Therefore, \u03c1 = C\u22121|s|2p\u22123|g\u02dc(s, t)|2 can be inter-\npreted as the energy density of the signal in the time scale\nplane [18].\n4 Results\n4.1 The effect of exercise on cardiac and respiratory\nrates\nAs expected, exercise caused an increase in both cardiac\nand respiratory frequencies as compared with the rest-\ning state (Table 1). During exercise the cardiac frequency\nusually increased significantly over the course of several\nminutes, generally reaching a plateau after 10 \u2212 20 min-\nutes. After exercise there was a period (< 10 mins) during\nwhich heart rate decreased to a level similar to that ob-\nserved before exercise. A similar trend was generally not\nseen in respiration, which was already at its resting value\nwhen measurements recommenced.\nTable 1.

After exercise, the variability increased\nto approximately the same amount as before. The reduc-\ntion of variability during exercise suggests that there is\nless \u201cexternal\u201d modulation of heart rate from other pro-\ncesses within the cardiovascular system. Conversely, the\nvariation in respiratory rate variability (RRV) appears to\nincrease with the onset of exercise: breathing was at a\nmuch steadier pace at rest than during exercise. These\ntwo effects show that exercise creates an observable per-\nturbation of the phase dynamics of the system.\n6 D. A.

An overview of instantaneous frequencies of cardiac\n(upper) and respiratory (lower) signals for subject 4 (RE, EX\nand AE). Notice the obvious increase in cardiac and respiratory\ninstantaneous frequencies. Also note the visible reduction in\nvariability of the cardiac signal, and the increase in variability\nof the respiratory signal.\n4.2 Synchronization\nSynchronization indices evaluated for a typical subject are\nshown in Fig. 2, revealing epochs of synchronization at\ndifferent n:m orders. Surrogate data were used to test the\nreliability with which synchronization could be identified:\none hundred different surrogate realizations were created\nby shuffling the instantaneous cardiac and respiratory fre-\nquencies for each subject. Evidence for synchronization\nwas then sought in the shuffled signals and compared with\nthe real data. The results in Fig. 3 show very significant\ndifferences between the real and shuffled signals for all\nthree states (RE, EX and AE). At RE, synchronization\nwas observed for all subjects. Taking subject 4 as an ex-\nample (Fig. 2) three different orders of synchronization,\n2:9, 1:5 and 2:11, are clearly present during RE and AE,\nwith transitions occurring between them. We rarely see\na discontinuous jump i.e. from 2:9 to 2:11, but rather a\nsmooth transition whereby 1:5 is reached before going to\n0.95\n1\n1:5 2:92:11\n\u03bb n\n,\nm\n0.95\n1\n1:62:11\n\u03bb n\n,\nm\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600\n0.95\n1\n1:5 2:92:11\n2:13\nTime (sec)\n\u03bb n\n,\nm\n1:5\n2:11\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nFig. 2.

The criterion for synchronization\nis that the synchronization index should exceed 0.95, and the\nduration of the episode should be greater than 20 seconds. For\ndetails see text.\n2:11 or returning to 2:9. This trend appears for all subjects\nshowing that, despite the nonlinearity in the dynamics of\nHRV and RRV, the synchronization ratios change between\nclose orders.\nAs we shall see, these transitions are attributable to\nthe influence of lower frequency oscillatory components\non the phases of cardiac activity and respiration. We em-\nphasize that cardio-respiratory synchronization does not\noccur continuously at a fixed frequency ratio. The cardio-\nrespiratory system is thermodynamically open and the\nexternal influences on it can be perceived as noise (see\nbelow) that sometime destroys the synchronization [3,9,\n19]. Consistent with earlier work [20], the short epochs of\nsynchronization (Fig. 2) are separated by longer intervals\nof apparent non-synchronization. Note that the analysis\nwas done for n \u2264 2 using the relatively strict criteria as\ndescribed in Sec. 3.1.2. It is possible that intervals with-\nout synchronization are on account of transitions between\nsynchronization ratios or synchronization is not detected\nbecause n \u2265 3 was not considered due to reliability.\nD.

For AE, we usually see these higher orders for the\nfirst few minutes before switching down to the lower orders\nobserved at rest.\n4.3 Modulation analysis by wavelets\nHRV and RRV can be considered as two interacting oscil-\nlators with time-variable frequencies. Wavelet analysis was\ncarried out on both the HRV and RRV in order to reveal\nhow their frequencies are modulated in time, i.e. which\nlower frequencies are responsible for the fluctuations in\nthe cardiac and respiratory rhythms seen in Fig. 1.\n4.4 Time-frequency analysis of cardiac frequency\nWavelet analysis of HRV reveals the existence of many\nmodulating frequencies.

The modulation is\na manifestation of RSA. During EX this modulation be-\ncomes much less apparent, and is correspondingly of a\nlower energy, while AE we see a return of the modulation.\nCardiovascular signals can be divided into frequency\nintervals, each relating to a specific physiological activity\nand containing a corresponding spectral peak. Here we\nsplit the signal into 4 frequency intervals (Table 2). For de-\ntails of the frequency intervals, see [18,21] and references\ntherein. This allows us to determine the origins of the var-\nious spectral components in the modulation. Frequency\nand amplitude wandering cause a broadening of the fre-\nquency peaks, due to couplings between the other oscil-\nlatory processes. Energies were calculated separately for\nthese frequency intervals to compare the dynamic changes\nbetween the states. A ranked sum statistical test was ap-\nplied, performed at a p = 0.05 significance level. Here-\nafter p1,2 refers to the change between RE and EX, p1,3\nthe changes between RE and AE, and p2,3 the change\nbetween EX and AE. The results were then plotted as\nbox plots (Fig. 4(b)). The total energy across all four fre-\nquency intervals (Fig. 4(c)) shows how the modulation of\nHRV decreases during EX, accounting for the reduction\nin variability seen in Fig. 1.\n8 D. A.

The horizontal lines of the box plots indicate the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th\nand 90th percentiles, with outliers not plotted. Significant changes of p < 0.05 are denoted by \u2217.\nDuring EX, there is a marked decrease in the abso-\nlute energy of regions II and III, relating to respiratory\n(p1,2 and p2,3 < 0.05) and myogenic (p1,2 and p2,3 < 0.05)\nactivity respectively. This myogenic activity originates in\nthe vascular smooth muscle that is also involved in the\nregulation of blood pressure. In addition, the capillaries\ndilate to regulate heat transfer during EX and could con-\ntribute to the observed reduction in energy. Respiration\nseems to play a less significant part in the modulation of\nheart rate during EX, in agreement with previous studies\nof HRV [22]. Within intervals II\u2013V, there is no statisti-\ncally significant difference between the energies in RE and\nAE (p1,3 > 0.05).\nOne contributory factor to the reduction in energy\ncould be the introduction of another oscillatory process,\nnamely locomotion, with which the heart and respiratory\nfunctions interact [23,24]. The reduction in the contri-\nbution to HRV from respiration during EX, as evident\nfrom the significantly reduced energy, would suggest that\nthe coupling between cardiac and respiratory processes is\nweakened during EX, and hence we would see less syn-\nchronization. We would not, however, expect a complete\ndisappearance of synchronization, as there still remains\nsome modulation during EX.\n4.5 Time-frequency analysis of respiratory frequency\nWavelet analysis was also carried out on RRV in the same\nmanner (Fig. 5). During EX, the absolute energy of the\nwavelet transform of RRV across the whole observed spec-\ntrum increased with the onset of EX (p1,2 and p2,3 < 0.01).\nThis accounts for the increased variability in respiratory\nfrequency seen in Fig. 1, as opposed to the decrease in\nD.

It would seems that it is this increased variabil-\nity of respiration, together with the reduction in external\ninfluence on cardiac frequency, that is destroying the syn-\nchronization epochs.\nThe origin of this overall increase in absolute energy\nis the neurogenic-related activity band and the myogenic\nfrequency component (all p1,2 and p2,3 < 0.01). There was\nno significant change in the endothelial-related activity.\n5 A model for the results\nIt is clear from Fig. 2 that the perturbation caused by\nexercise reduces epochs of synchronization. Our wavelet\nanalysis showed that the modulation of heart rate by res-\npiration is reduced during EX, an effect that is short-lived\nin the recovery period AE. The reduction in synchroniza-\ntion epochs agrees with the drop in energy found in the\nfrequency spectrum of HRV relating to respiration dur-\ning EX, so that we have less interaction between the two\noscillators. So, the questions raised here are (i) why the\ntransitions between close orders of synchronization occur\nand (ii) can we account for the differences between resting\nand exercise?\nTo answer these questions, we begin by reviewing and\ngeneralizing the phase dynamical model of two interact-\ning oscillators. If we have a small coupling \u01eb between our\ntwo self-sustaining systems, namely the heart and respira-\ntion, we can derive closed equations for the phases [25,15].\nHence we investigate two interacting oscillators, X1 and\nX2, representing the cardiac and respiratory oscillations\nrespectively\ndXi\ndt\n= fi(Xi) + \u01ebpi(X1,X2), i = 1, 2. (7)\nWe do not assume any similarity between the two inter-\nacting systems. As it is well known that a perturbation in\nrespiration will change HRV more than a similar pertur-\n10 D. A. Kenwright et al.: The effect of low-frequency oscillations on cardio-respiratory synchronization\nbation in HRV will change respiration[10,26,27], the cou-\npling between the two should be asymmetric. The only as-\nsumption we make is that the autonomous dynamics given\nby the functions f1,2 can be separated from the interaction\ndescribed by generally different terms p1,2 multiplying the\ncoupling constant \u01eb.\nFor self-sustained systems there exists a motion whose\namplitude neither grows nor decays, and the motion is said\nto approach a limit cycle. By setting the coupling constant\n\u01eb to zero, the system is said to achieve a stable limit cycle\nof frequency \u03c91,2. Hence we can introduce two phases on\nthe cycles and their vicinities,\nd\u03c6i\ndt\n= \u03c9i, i = 1, 2. (8)\nIn general, the frequencies \u03c91 and \u03c92 are incommensu-\nrate, so that the motion of the uncoupled oscillators is\nquasi-periodic. If we assume that for a weak coupling the\nperturbations in amplitude are small, in the first approxi-\nmation we can write the equation for phases [?] in coupled\na system as\nd\u03c6i\ndt\n= \u03c9i + \u01ebQi(\u03c61, \u03c62), (9)\nwhere the functions Q1,2 are 2\u03c0 periodic. Q1,2 can be rep-\nresented as a double Fourier series\nQi(\u03c61, \u03c62) =\n\u2211\nk,l\nak,li e\nik\u03c61+il\u03c62 . (10)\nIn the zeroth approximation, the phases rotate with natu-\nral frequencies and in Q1,2 all terms correspond to fast ro-\ntations, with the exception of those satisfying the resonant\ncondition k\u03c91+ l\u03c92 = \u03b4 \u2248 0. Assuming that the two natu-\nral frequencies \u03c91,2 are nearly in resonance, then\n\u03c91\n\u03c92\n= mn .\nTherefore all the terms in the Fourier series with k = nj\nand l = \u2212mj are resonant and contribute to the aver-\naged equations. One can then obtain Qi \u2192 qi(n\u03c61\u2212m\u03c62)\nwhere qi are the resonant terms of summations (10). More\ngenerally, there are other terms like qi (with different ar-\nguments) which contribute to summations (10).\nIt is evident from Figs. 4 and 5, there are many os-\ncillatory components interacting with the heart and res-\npiration. While the physiological origin of the oscillations\ncontributing to HRV has been extensively studied, there\nis no report to date on the possible mechanisms of oscil-\nlations in RRV. However, most of the oscillations propa-\ngate through the CVS, so for RRV we consider the same\nfrequency intervals identified by wavelet analysis of other\nsignals such as blood flow and HRV (Table 2) [18,21]. Note\nthat the respiratory interval and any higher frequency do\nnot appear in the wavelet transform of RRV due to the\nconstruction of instantaneous frequencies.\nWe therefore regard CVS signals as containing two os-\ncillating components originating from cardiac and respi-\nratory activity, together with colored noise representing\nvarious other oscillatory processes and some interactions\nbetween each system. When focusing on cardio-respiratory\ninteractions, therefore, we treat everything else that may\nhave some interaction with our two systems, cardiac and\nrespiratory, as \u201cnoise\u201d. However, through spectral analy-\nsis we can determine the contribution of the rest of the\nCVS to the modulation of these two systems. Currently,\nthe full extent of all the interactions is undetermined. We\ndo not have enough information about the couplings (such\nas the direction and strength of the couplings) to investi-\ngate all possible interactions in our phase-coupled model,\nso we investigate them as low-frequency noise\nd\u03c6i\ndt\n= \u03c9i + \u01ebQi(\u03c61, \u03c62) + \u03b7i(t), (11)\nwhere \u03b7i(t) represent low-frequency noise of variance \u03c3\u03b7i .\nA sequence of values \u03b7i(t) is produced by Fourier filter-\ning [28]. This method is based on a transformation of the\nFourier components {u(k)} of a sequence {u(t)} which are\nuncorrelated random numbers with a Gaussian distribu-\ntion. A sequence of \u03b7i(k) is generated for a given \u03b1 using\nthe formula: \u03b7i(k) = k\n\u2212(2\u03b1\u22121)\/2u(k) = k\u2212\u03b2\/2u(k). Inverse\nFourier transformation of the sequence \u03b7i(k) leads to \u03b7i(t).\nIt consists of random variables, spatially correlated with\nD. A.

The exponent \u03b1 is called the\ncorrelation exponent, and quantifies the degree of correla-\ntion imposed on the system. Note that the case \u03b1 = 0.5\n(or \u03b2 = 0) corresponds to uncorrelated disorder (white\nnoise), while the case \u03b1 > 0.5 indicates positive correla-\ntion. We note that the sequences produced by this method\nare normalized, so that the mean value of \u03b7i(t) is set to\nzero and its variance is fixed at \u03c3\u03b7i . In Fig. 6 and 7 we\nhave two different cases, \u03b2 = 0 and \u03b2 = 1, corresponding\nto white and correlated noise respectively, together with\ntheir wavelet transforms. For \u03b2 = 0 (white noise) wavelet\nanalysis shows fluctuations around a constant value for\nthe whole range of frequencies. However, for \u03b2 = 1 (cor-\nrelated noise), the wavelet amplitude increases for lower\nfrequencies. Therefore, low-frequency noise is a good can-\ndidate for approximating the other oscillatory components\ne.g. myogenic, neurogenic and endothelial.\nWe now use this model to see if it can illuminate the\nquestions raised in the discussion. To parameterize it we\nhave used the median values of cardiac and respiration\nfrequencies at rest for the 10 subjects (i.e. from Table. 1,\nthe median value of cardiac frequency is \u03c91 = 1.12Hz and\n0 500 1000 1500 2000\n\u22121\n\u22120.5\n0\n0.5\n1\nTime (sec)\nAm\npl\nitu\nde\n \n0 500 1000 1500 2000\n0.0095\n0.021\n0.052\n0.145\n0.6  \nTime (sec)\n \nFr\neq\nue\nnc\ny \n(H\nz)\n1 2 3 4 (Hz)\n0 1 2 3\nAmplitude (Hz)\n(a)\n(b) (c)\nFig. 7. (a) Low-frequency noise and (b) its wavelet transform.\nUnlike white noise the time averaged wavelet (c) increases for\nlower frequencies.\nfor respiration frequency is \u03c92 = 0.29Hz). Next we need\nto deal with the couplings between the cardiac and res-\npiration phases, ak,li . It is already established from the\nresults of methods specifically developed for detecting the\ncoupling directionality of interacting phases [26,27,29\u201331],\nand with direct physiological observations, that respira-\ntion drives the heart more than the reverse. Moreover,\nthese coupling terms should have perturbation character-\nistics comparable to natural frequencies \u03c91,2. An appro-\npriate choice is therefore ak,l1 = 0.1 and a\nk,l\n2 = 0.05. We\nhave also set \u03c3\u03b71 = 0.22 and \u03c3\u03b72 = 0.1.\nStarting with Eq. (11) we construct two phase series\nand then calculate their synchronization episodes (8) for\n\u03b2 = 0 and \u03b2 = 1. The results are shown in Figs. 8\n(a) and (b). For the \u03b2 = 0 case, there are episodes of\nsynchronization separated by intervals of apparent non-\nsynchronization, but almost no transitions to different syn-\nchronization indices. For \u03b2 = 1, however, we see synchro-\nnization with several different indices. These results sug-\ngest that transitions between the different cardio-respiratory\nsynchronization indices originate via couplings to lower\nfrequency oscillatory components i.e. the myogenic, neu-\nrogenic and endothelial oscillations (see Table 2).\nThis model can also easily be applied to the EX regime.\nEX brings about many physiological changes as we can\n12 D. A. Kenwright et al.: The effect of low-frequency oscillations on cardio-respiratory synchronization\nsee from the experimental data that must be regulated\nby both the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. The\nmuscles and various organs have a greater demand for oxy-\ngen and nutrients from the blood, increasing both cardiac\nand respiratory output, and hence their frequencies. Tak-\ning this into account, we have increased the model cardiac\nfrequency from 1.13Hz (the median during RE) to 1.85Hz\n(the median during EX) and respiration frequency from\n0.29Hz to 0.42H\u02d9z. Fig. 8 shows the synchronization in-\ndices during EX derived numerically for ak,l1 = 0.05 and\nak,l2 = 0.01, \u03c3\u03b71 = 0.22 and \u03c3\u03b72 = 0.14. In agrement with\nexperimental results, the synchronization is markedly de-\ncreased during EX. This is due to the change in variation\nof respiration (see Fig. 1) which makes the system noisier\nand reduces our chance of having synchronization, even\nthough the variability of cardiac activity is reduced dur-\ning EX. In fact, this observation confirms that respiration\nplays the major role in cardio-respiratory synchronization.\nThe synchronization that appeared during EX is clearly\nof a higher n : m order, corresponding to the fact that\ncardiac frequency has increased proportionally more than\nrespiration frequency.\n6 Summary and conclusion\nIn summary, there are differences between cardiovascu-\nlar oscillations during exercise, as compared to the rest-\ning states before exercise and afterwards. In all cases,\nepisodes of cardio-respiratory synchronization occurred,\nseparated by intervals of apparent non-synchronization.\nSynchronization during EX tended to be of higher or-\nder, presumably on account of the larger frequency ra-\ntio, and the synchronization time (integrated duration of\nepisodes) was smaller. The occurrence of transitions be-\ntween synchronization states of different order and non-\nsynchronization is attributable to the modulation of the\ncardiac and respiratory frequencies by lower-frequency com-\n200 400 600 8000.99\n1\nTime (sec)\n\u03bb n\n,\nm\n1:5 1:4\n(a)\n200 400 600 8000.99\n1\nTime (sec)\n\u03bb n\n,\nm\n1:3 2:7\n1:4\n1:5\n(b)\nFig. 8. Synchronization epochs derived from phase coupled\nwith white noise (a) and low-frequency noise (b) during RE.\nIn the white noise case, we have very few transitions between\nsynchronization indices, whereas in the low-frequency noise\ncase, the transitions between close synchronization indices oc-\ncur more often.\nponents coming from e.g. myogenic, neurogenic and en-\ndothelial processes. The reduced HRV during exercise,\ndespite the increased RRV, is taken to imply that the\nstrength of the cardio-respiratory interaction is reduced\nin EX. The observed synchronization phenomena were re-\nproduced using a simple numerical model in which the\nlower frequency processes were lumped together as a form\nof low-frequency coloured noise.\nD.
