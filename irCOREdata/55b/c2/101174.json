Picnics, children\u2019s parties, fun and games took the place of the usual\ntraffic, the demonstration intended to make a statement about the need to reclaim the\nstreets from vehicles.\nThe Austrian authorities considered that the demonstration satisfied the requirements of\nthe relevant laws on assembly,1 and therefore upheld the rights of those individuals involved\nto participate in this protest. It seemed, however, that the authorities gave little thought to\nwhether any point of Community law was raised by this action, or if they did consider it they\nconcluded they still had to permit the closure of the road.\nSchmidberger then sued the Austrian Republic in Austrian courts for damages under the\nstate liability heading of Community law. Damages were sought to compensate the haulier\nfor losses suffered while its lorries were prevented from using the A13 in contravention of\nCommunity free movement rights as set out in Articles 28 and 29 of the European Community\n1 Paragraphs 2, 6 and 16 of the Versammlungsgesetz (Law on assembly) of 1953, as amended; paras 42\nand 86 of the Stra\u00dfenverkehrsordnung (Highway Code) of 1960, as amended.\nC A S E  N O T E S\nE N V  L  R E V  6  ( 2 0 0 4 )  1 9 0 \u2013 2 0 3\n191\nTreaty (EC), and the Republic\u2019s duty under Article 10 EC of loyalty to the Community order.\nThe action was dismissed by the Tyrolean lower courts on the grounds that Schmidberger\nhad known about the intended protest and taken no action to change its lorries\u2019 routes or\nsomehow otherwise to avoid its losses. An appeal hearing on whether Schmidberger\u2019s lack of\nmitigating action denied the company the right to assert its Community law rights was\nstayed when the higher court referred questions to the European Court of Justice for a\npreliminary ruling under Article 234 EC.\nThe Court of Justice considered the merits of both the freedom to move goods around the\nsingle market,2 and the rights of protestors to assemble.3 The Court considered whether the\ntwo can be \u2018balanced\u2019,4 and whether breach of the former gave rise to state liability in\ndamages,5 concluding that a breach of free movement rights was exactly the sort of thing\nthe doctrine of state liability was intended to remedy.\nIt was held that this protest was a restriction on the rights of Schmidberger to move goods\naround the market,6 and that the Austrian authorities were under a duty to take all appropriate\nmeasures to ensure the freedom of traders to move goods around their territory.7\nThat being so, protest was considered, however, to be a justifiable limitation on the free\nmovement standard since the right to assemble is upheld by Articles 10 and 11 of the European\nConvention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR). The Court of Justice\naffirmed the role the European Convention plays in the Community legal order, with the\nrespect of its provisions a \u2018general principle\u2019 of Community law.8 In the light of the wide\nmargin of appreciation accorded to states seeking to uphold Articles 10 and 11 ECHR\nrights,9 and in the light of the proportional response from the Austrian authorities to the\norganisation of the Transitforum Austria Tirol protest,10 the failure to keep the A13 open\nto traffic did not amount to a breach of Article 28 EC free movement rights or Article 10\nstate loyalty obligations, and therefore could not give rise to any liability on the part of the\nRepublic to the haulier.11\nCOMMENT\nSchmidberger is one of the European Court of Justice\u2019s showier judgments. It is a ruling that\nasks to be noticed, and not just for the quality of its argument and reasoning. At the time of\nthe European Union\u2019s largest expansion, it is interesting to note the impact accession countries\nhave upon the development of the Community legal order. Austria was one of the new\nmembers before May 2004, and Schmidberger is a case where the unresolved disputes\nsurrounding accession were given a further airing, with somewhat surprising consequences\nfor both free movement law and the common transport policy. This case is just another\nexample of how accession of states to the Union adds to its legal culture.\nThe particular impact of Austrian accession can be identified in the large number of\npreliminary references from Austrian courts on the contested and somewhat confused\n2 At paras 47 to 64 of the judgment.\n3 At paras 73 to 80 of the judgment.\n4 At paras 81 to 82 of the judgment.\n5 At paras 22 and 95 of the judgment.\n6 At para. 64 of the judgment.\n7 At paras. 60 to 64 of the judgment.\n8 At para. 71 of the judgment.\n9 At para. 82 of the judgment.\n10 At para. 87 of the judgment.\n11 At para. 94 of the judgment.\nE N V I R O N M E N T A L  L A W  R E V I E W\nE N V  L  R E V  6  ( 2 0 0 4 )  1 9 0 \u2013 2 0 3\n192\nquestion of state liability for breaches of Community law.12 Indeed, Schmidberger itself is\nlargely grounded on these complexities. But Schmidberger is also an environmental law case,\nand in particular an environmental law case that raises some profound questions as to the\nrelationship between fundamental rights and the free trading foundational freedoms of\nCommunity law.\nThat such questions should emanate from the Tyrol is unsurprising to all those who are\nacquainted with the debate in Austria as the Republic considered Union membership. The\nprospect of Community legal norms overruling hard-won environmental standards was\nmanifested in the \u2018No\u2019 campaign fought on transport, agricultural and nuclear policy grounds\nwhen membership was put to the vote prior to accession. No doubt other national issues will\nreturn to the agenda raised by the post-May 2004 states, whatever the resolution of these\nissues in their accession Treaties. The interesting thing about this is that Schmidberger\nevidences the fluid nature of even settled law. Those expecting that the fundamental freedom\nto move goods around the single market largely trumped every other consideration have\nbeen given a clear signal that PreussenElektra13 was not an aberration \u2013 the Court of Justice\nis willing to move some distance from its protection of the rights of traders as formulated in\nseminal cases such as Dassonville14 in the interests of environmental protection.\nAnd there are environmental problems directly caused by the sheer volume of traffic in the\nTyrol. The main transit route between Italy and Germany is the A13\/A12 Tyrol corridor\nlinking the Brenner Pass with Kufstein. It was estimated in 1994 that over 80 per cent of this\nroad\u2019s traffic was in transit. Growth in traffic crossing the Alps has been relentless, and the\nimpact of Austrian accession to the Union in 1995 is quite marked. In 1994 Alpine north-\nsouth merchandise traffic (traversing at any point between Ventimiglia and Vienna) amounted\nto 132.8 million tonnes,15 45 per cent of which crossed Austria.16 The Brenner Pass absorbed\n35 per cent of all Alpine transit17 when there are 18 recognised crossing routes, and at a time\nwhen Austria was not yet bound by the common transport policy. By 1998, the Brenner Pass\nand Tyrol corridor were taking 40 per cent of all Alpine goods road traffic, the increased\nshare a simple consequence of three years of membership of the European Union with\nincreased trade volumes. Debates in the European Parliament in 2003 noted that by 2001\ntraffic crossing Austria had increased by 50 per cent of 1991 figures.18\nTraffic volume is easily linked to environmental concern, and widespread concern is as good\na cause as any for protest. The demonstrations on the A13 were then motivated by causes\nthat can be understood by all those interested in protecting the environment, and no doubt\neven those sitting in the Court of Justice in Luxembourg.\nThat being said, it is of course easy to recognise that the situation in Schmidberger presented\nthe Court with little by way of choice. A judgment that held the temporary closure of a\n12 See, for example, case C-302\/97 Konle v Austria [1999] ECR I-3099, case C-140\/97 Rechberger and\nothers v Austria [1999] ECR I-3499 and then the really quite remarkable judgment in case C-224\/01\nK\u00f6bler v Austria [2003] ECR I (no page reference yet \u2014 see www.curia.eu.int for a transcript of the\njudgment) on state liability for judgments of supreme courts that may give rise to damages for\ncontravening Community law standards.\n13 Case C-379\/98 PreussenElektra [2001] ECR I-2099.\n14 Case 8\/74 Dassonville [1974] ECR 837.\n15 GS EVED (Swiss Transport Service) Alpenquerender G\u00fcterverhehr auf Stra\u00dfe und Schiene 1994 (Trans-\nAlpine Goods Traffic by Road and Rail 1994), Bern: GS EVED, 1995.\n16 Ibid. at XV; 29 per cent crossed France and 26 per cent Switzerland.\n17 Ibid.\n18 European Parliament sitting 11 February 2003, see www3.europarl.eu.int\/omk\/omnsapir.so\/\ndebatsL5?FILE=20030211EN&LANGUE=EN&LEVEL=DOC&NUMINT=2-162.\nC A S E  N O T E S\nE N V  L  R E V  6  ( 2 0 0 4 )  1 9 0 \u2013 2 0 3\n193\nmotorway fell foul of the right to move goods would have left the Court exposed to the\nobvious question: why should states with motorways (transit, European or otherwise) be\nunder greater obligations as to the need to keep trade moving than those who never bothered\nto build such routes? But Schmidberger is interesting because the Court of Justice goes well\nbeyond accepting that which cannot be avoided. The ruling clearly sets out a certain\nacceptance that there are rights to assemble and protest, that such rights frustrate other\nrights to trade or move freely, but the Community legal order will not just seek to balance\nthe two. The Community legal order acknowledges that sometimes the right to protest\noutweighs all other considerations, even foundational trading freedoms.19 In so doing the\nCourt of Justice made clear the distinction between the Tyrolean demonstration and French\nfarmers\u2019 violent and destructive protests over the import of Spanish strawberries and Belgian\ntomatoes condemned in the Commission v France judgment.20 There the French authorities\nhad been found not to have done enough to protect single market (presumably Spanish and\nBelgian) traders\u2019 rights. Presumably, the French campaign was thought to be motivated by\na prejudice that struck to the heart of the single market concept, and the response of the\nrelevant authorities was widely considered to be minimal. The Tyrolean protest was different.\nThe environmental credentials of the organisers were noted,21 and efforts made by the\nAustrian authorities to publicise the road-closure were cited approvingly. The suspicion\nremains though that the difference between a protest by the well-dressed and better behaved\nTyrolean compared to the rurally attired and more d\u00e9sagr\u00e9able French farmer is not so great.\nThe French farmer\u2019s reputation somehow goes before him. Austrian environmentalists manage\nto make their green seem a very different shade to khaki.\nAt exactly what point the state falls under a duty to maintain traders\u2019 freedoms in the light\nof organised protest is not clear. Suffice it to say all states have a duty to do something about\ntheir citizens\u2019 actions when disruption to the single market is threatened. That much is\ncertain following Commission v France. And then, well-organised protest about a legitimate\ncomplaint, be it heavy traffic in the Alps or be it other as yet unrecognised grounds, can\ndisrupt the single market. That is the result of Schmidberger.\nIt seems there is a certain quality to environmental protest that the Court is willing to\naccept. It is unlikely that a degree of divergence on the sorts of protests disrupting the single\nmarket is what the Court has in mind. That is to say, it could be argued that protest motivated\nby environmentalism in Austria and pro-life campaigns in Ireland are able to outweigh\nsingle market freedoms there since each provokes passion in its national context. Perhaps\nthen environmentally motivated disruptions to trade in Italy or pro-life protests in clinics in\nBritain are not so acceptable because environmentalists in Italy and pro-lifers in Britain just\ndo not have the same credentials. This is surely not what the Court intends. The result would\nsoon be a choice for the authorities in each Member State as to when and where to protect\nsingle market traders\u2019 rights and perhaps many would see this as an opportunity to do\nnothing. So it is probably not because environmental protection is important to Austrians\nthat the Tyrol protest was thought acceptable. It is difficult to establish whether\nenvironmental protection as threatened by trans-border transit traffic is more important to\nAustrians than the rural way of life as threatened by trans-border trade in produce is to\nFrench farmers.\nAcceptable protest affecting the single market must then be more to do with the type of\nprotest envisaged and the way it is implemented. The conclusion to that then is that perhaps\n19 At para. 90 of the judgment.\n20 Case C-265\/95 Commission v France [1997] ECR I-6959.\n21 At para. 10 of the judgment.\nE N V I R O N M E N T A L  L A W  R E V I E W\nE N V  L  R E V  6  ( 2 0 0 4 )  1 9 0 \u2013 2 0 3\n194\nthe French farmers need to be more environmental in their objectives. Perhaps targeting\nSpanish produce from the Canaries would be acceptable since Greenpeace\u2019s challenge to\nEuropean Union funding of the construction of power stations on Tenerife and Gran Canaria,22\nbut not Spanish produce from environmentally friendlier sources.\nCertainly the considered inaction of the Austrian authorities was thought better of than the\nmore sporadic action of the French authorities, in their different scenarios. In particular\nthe lodging of a request for permission to demonstrate on the motorway and the subsequent\npublicity and\/or notification of the demonstration to all those who may be interested or\naffected by it in Austria, Germany and Italy was taken as evidence of an altogether more\nproportionate expression of Article 10 and 11 ECHR rights. It is, though, a question for the\nCourt to consider if well-organised disruption is conceptually different to poorly organised\ndisruption, whatever the relative merits of either. It is not clear that the European Court of\nHuman Rights case law on Articles 10 and 11 ECHR should disenfranchise the wrong sort of\nprotest any more than it should exclude protests on the wrong sort of subject.\nThe Court does note that the freedoms to protest and assemble, as expressed in Articles 10\nand 11 ECHR, are themselves couched in limitations that perhaps go some way to assisting\nin the navigation of the line between Schmidberger and Commission v France.  This is simply\nput as the recognition within the Convention right that each state can limit the expression of\nthis right to the extent the limitation is necessary in a democratic society. The Court of\nJustice then cites the \u2018wide margin of appreciation\u2019 afforded to states to define what these\nlimits should be,23 in its approving comments of the Austrian authorities\u2019 response to the\nTyrolean demonstration. But it is submitted that this does not really take us much further\nforward. It is still not clear why some protests can frustrate single market freedoms and\nwhen some go too far. It is not as though Commission v France was overruled in Schmidberger.\nIndeed, it was affirmed.24\nThat being so, there is still something particular about the Tyrolean problem because of its\nexceptional location in between German and Italian trading giants, and amidst a supposedly\nfragile ecological landscape upon which much of the region depends for its livelihood.25 It\nmust also be noted that the environment is acknowledged both in the EC Treaty,26 and in\nCourt of Justice case law,27 whereas the Court has never taken kindly to any form of action\nthat smells of nationality discrimination.28\nFurther, the problem of transit through the Tyrol is in fact acknowledged by special rules\napplying to vehicles in clear derogation to the general free movement framework and in\nparticular exception to the common transport policy. A Regulation permits the continued\nrequirement of \u2018eco-points\u2019 for heavy goods vehicles crossing Austria, calculated in such a\n22 See case C-321\/95 P Stichting Greenpeace Council (Greenpeace International) and Others v Commission\n[1998] ECR I-1651.\n23 At paras 77 and 80 of the Schmidberger judgment.\n24 At para. 86.\n25 Agriculture is obviously affected by environmental factors. Tourism is, though, a significant factor in\nthe Tyrolean economy, and perceived threats to summer and winter attractions caused by\nenvironmental degradation are taken very seriously.\n26 Article 6 EC sets out a general principle of sustainability, while Art. 174 EC empowers the Community\nin its environmental policy.\n27 Numerous decisions take note of the significance of environmental protection, from PreussenElektra,\ncited above, right back to the case 302\/86 Commission v Denmark [1988] ECR 4607 judgment on the\nproportionality of recycling schemes affecting the quantity of drinks sold in the common market.\n28 Again, numerous cases could be cited here. But this is the justification for affirming Commission v\nFrance in Schmidberger.\nC A S E  N O T E S\nE N V  L  R E V  6  ( 2 0 0 4 )  1 9 0 \u2013 2 0 3\n195\n29 European Parliament and Council Regulation 2327\/2003\/EC on a transitional points system applicable\nto heavy goods vehicles travelling through Austria for 2004 within the framework of a sustainable\ntransport policy (OJ L345\/30 2003).\n30 Transit Treaty between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Austria (then a\nnon-Member State) (OJ L373\/22 1992), with the eco-points scheme implemented by Council\nRegulation 3637\/92\/EEC (OJ L373\/1 1992) Annex I.\n31 Protocol XI (in particular Article 11 and Annex 4) of the Act concerning the conditions of accession\nof the Kingdom of Norway, the Republic of Austria, the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of\nSweden and the adjustment to the Treaties on which the European Union is founded (OJ C241\/08\n1994).\n32 See the House of Lords judgment in R v Chief Constable of Sussex ex p. International Trader\u2019s Ferry Ltd\n[1999] 2 AC 418. Here the possible infringement of the Art. 29 EC freedom to export was thought\nsubject to police discretion motivated by factors such as the police budget. But if Schmidberger is\napplied, the right to trade itself can be offset by the right to protest.\nway as to restrict the volume of vehicles and thereby the levels of emitting pollutants.29 This\nis in fact a continuation of an older scheme,30 that was then annexed to the Accession Treaty\nwhen Austria joined the Union,31 but which was then supposed to expire in December 2003.\nThe interaction between Community law standards and the European Convention is one of\nthe most notable outcomes of this judgment and it is interesting to consider exactly what\nelse might follow from this line of authority. It could then be that English protests on the\ntrade in livestock, so long as motivated by animal welfare, should no longer be an issue of\npolice discretion somehow outside of the ambit of Article 29 EC, but instead be firmly\nlocated within Community law as an example of a limitation on free movement justified by\nthe right to protest.32 Perhaps privacy rights under Article 8 ECHR will lead to other trading\nlimitations, with potential impact no doubt on competition law. What is clearest in Schmidberger\nis that the Court of Justice is willing to hear arguments on both environmental protection\nand fundamental rights even when they limit the foundational freedoms of the single market.\nMatthew Humphreys\nUniversity of Surrey\nE N V I R O N M E N T A L  L A W  R E V I E W\nE N V  L  R E V  6  ( 2 0 0 4 )  1 9 0 \u2013 2 0 3\n196\nHUMAN RIGHTS IN THE BALANCE \u2013 HATTON AND\nMARCIC\nHatton v United Kingdom [2004] 1 All ER 135\nMarcic v Thames Water (2003) 37 EHRR 28\nHuman rights, discretion of regulator, balance of economic and susceptible individual\u2019s interests,\ndoctrine of the margin of appreciation, environmental rights\nFACTS\nHatton v United Kingdom1\nThe litigation in Hatton v United Kingdom was brought by Ms Hatton and seven other members\nof the Heathrow Association for the Control of Aircraft Noise (HACAN-ClearSkies),\nrepresented by the leading environmental litigator, Richard Buxton. Their claim was that\nGovernment policy on night flights at Heathrow airport violated their rights under Article 8\nof the Convention and that they were denied an effective domestic remedy for this complaint,\ncontrary to Article 13 of the Convention.\nThe claim was lodged in May 1997 and held to be admissible in May 2000, and was first\nconsidered by the Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights (hereafter \u2018the Chamber\u2019)\nwho held, in November 2001, that there had been a violation of Article 8 (by five votes to\ntwo) and that there had been a violation of Article 13 (by six votes to one). The Chamber also\ndecided (by six votes to one) to award each applicant \u00a34,000 as compensation for non-\npecuniary damages including a payment for costs.2 The UK judge, Sir Brian Kerr, dissented\non all three of these decisions and in December 2001 the UK Government asked for them to\nbe referred to the Grand Chamber (hereafter \u2018the Grand Chamber\u2019) pursuant to Article 43\nof the Convention and Rule 73, a request that was accepted in March 2002. The hearing took\nplace in November 2002 and when the Grand Chamber gave its judgment in July 2003, it\nfound in favour of the Government on Article 8 (by 12 votes to five) and in favour of the\napplicants on Article 13 (by 16 votes to one), thereby concluding the six-year ECHR process.\nMarcic v Thames Water3\nPeter Marcic brought a claim against Thames Water for the serious and repeated external\nsewer flooding he had suffered at his home, where he had lived for over 20 years. The\nflooding resulted from overflow from public sewers, adequate when laid (assumed to be in\nthe 1930s) but subsequently overwhelmed because of increased housing development. Mr\nMarcic\u2019s house, at the low point of the drainage system, had been repeatedly flooded (the\nHouse of Lords identified up to 17 occasions when this had happened between 1992 and\n2000) and this had caused the acknowledged damp and subsidence to the property as well as\npossible structural damage. Mr Marcic had mitigated his losses by constructing his own\nflood defence system, at a cost of \u00a316,000, works which, their Lordships acknowledged, were\nthe sole reason why floodwater no longer entered the curtilage of his home. In 1998 Mr\nMarcic began his action against Thames Water in nuisance and under the newly introduced\n1 [2004] 1 All ER 135.\n2 For an analysis of this case see Antonia Layard, \u2018Night Flights: A Surprising Victory \u2013 Hatton v United\nKingdom\u2019, Env L Rev 4 (2002) 51.\n3 (2003) 37 EHRR 28.\nC A S E  N O T E S\nE N V  L  R E V  6  ( 2 0 0 4 )  1 9 0 \u2013 2 0 3\n197\nHuman Rights Act for a mandatory order compelling Thames Water to improve the sewerage\nsystem and damages. At both first instance and in the Court of Appeal Mr Marcic was\nsuccessful,4 initially under the 1998 Act and subsequently under both principles of common\nlaw and under the Act. Ultimately, however, Mr Marcic failed in his action before the House\nof Lords.\nDECISION IN HATTON\nAs in the earlier litigation, the key policy the applicants complained of in Hatton was the\n1993 scheme for regulating night flights at Heathrow. The Grand Chamber in 2003 accepted\nthat there was harm, finding that the implementation of this scheme was \u2018susceptible of\nadversely affecting the quality of the applicants\u2019 private life and the scope for their enjoying\nthe amenities of their respective homes, and thus their rights protected by Article 8 of the\nConvention\u2019. Indeed they held (a conclusion with which the Government agreed) that\nsensitivity to noise includes a subjective element, with a small minority of people being\nmore likely than others to be awoken or otherwise disturbed in their sleep by aircraft noise\nat night.5 The Grand Chamber accepted that these individuals constituted part of this minority\neven though it felt itself unable to make a definitive decision about whether the noise levels\ndeteriorated after the 1993 scheme was implemented.6 Nevertheless, the majority concluded\nthat in implementing the 1993 scheme, the authorities had not overstepped their margin of\nappreciation and that regulators had not, in their view, failed to strike a fair balance between\nthe right of the individuals affected by those regulations to respect for their private life and\nhome, and the conflicting interests of others and of the community as a whole. Accordingly,\nthe majority found no violation of Article 8.\nThe Grand Chamber did find, however, with only Sir Brian Kerr dissenting,7 that there had\nbeen a breach of Article 13,8 concluding that in this instance judicial review had not been an\neffective remedy in relation to their arguable9 rights under Article 8 of the Convention. This\nwas an argument the Chamber had also upheld and the Grand Chamber agreed that since\nthe aircraft operator had complied with the 1993 scheme and the relevant regulations, no\naction lay in trespass or nuisance in respect of lawful night flights since the Civil Aviation\nAct 1982, s. 76 prohibits actions in nuisance in respect of excessive noise caused by aircraft\nat night. Noting the earlier divergent decisions on the adequacy of judicial review,10 the\nGrand Chamber agreed with the Government that judicial review proceedings could be\neffective, for instance by establishing that the 1993 scheme was unlawful because the gap\nbetween Government policy and practice was too wide.11 However, they concluded that:\nit is clear, as noted by the Chamber, that the scope of review by the domestic courts was limited to\nthe classic English public law concepts, such as irrationality, unlawfulness and patent\n4 For an analysis of the Court of Appeal decision see William Howarth, \u2018Flood Defence Law after\nMarcic\u2019, Env L Rev 5 (2003) 23.\n5 At para. 118.\n6 At para. 124. The Court eventually brushed aside concerns about special sensitivity, concluding that\nin coming to a \u2018balanced\u2019 decision, the Government was entitled in this context to rely on \u2018statistical\ndata based on average perception of noise disturbance\u2019, para. 125.\n7 Sir Brian Kerr was the sole dissenter.\n8 \u2018Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in this Convention are violated shall have an\neffective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed\nby persons acting in an official capacity.\u2019\n9 According to earlier jurisprudence, a remedy in domestic law is required only in respect of grievances\nwhich can be regarded as \u2018arguable\u2019 in terms of the Convention (citing Boyle and Rice v The United\nKingdom, 27 April 1988, Series A no. 131, \u00a7 54), see para. 139.\n10 See Vilvarajah and Others v The United Kingdom of 30 October 1991, Series A no. 215, and Smith and\nGrady v The United Kingdom of 27 September 1999, ECHR 1999-VI.\nE N V I R O N M E N T A L  L A W  R E V I E W\nE N V  L  R E V  6  ( 2 0 0 4 )  1 9 0 \u2013 2 0 3\n198\nunreasonableness, and did not at the time (that is, prior to the entry into force of the Human\nRights Act 1998) allow consideration of whether the claimed increase in night flights under the\n1993 Scheme represented a justifiable limitation on the right to respect for the private and family\nlives or the homes of those who live in the vicinity of Heathrow airport.12\nConsequently, the Grand Chamber found that the scope of review by the domestic courts in\nthe present case was not sufficient to comply with Article 13 though it concluded that the\nfinding of a violation in itself constituted adequate just satisfaction in respect of any non-\npecuniary damage and, more significant for the applicants still, reduced the award of costs\nconsiderably.13\nDECISION IN MARCIC\nThe primary reason for the rejection of Mr Marcic\u2019s claim in nuisance14 by the House of\nLords was that his cause of action here was simply \u2018inconsistent with the statutory scheme\u2019,\nsince in order to achieve a fair system of priorities, balancing is inevitable and whether \u2018the\nsystem adopted by a sewerage undertaker is fair is a matter inherently more suited for\ndecision by the industry regulator than by a court\u2019.15 Indeed, according to the House of\nLords, a statutory remedy existed for cases of unfairness, since the Water Resources Act\n1991, s. 94(3) provides that the only way to enforce a sewerage undertaker\u2019s duty to provide\nan adequate system of public sewers under s. 94(1) is by the Director acting under s. 18, in\naccordance with a general authorisation given by the Secretary of State. There is no direct\nremedy in common law, having been specifically excluded by the statutory scheme.\nThe problem for Mr Marcic was that, even though Lord Nicholls accepted that there had\nbeen a prima facie contravention of s. 94, since Thames Water had not complied with the\nprovision requiring every sewerage undertaker \u2018to provide, improve and extend such a system\nof public sewers (whether inside its area or elsewhere) and so to cleanse and maintain those\nsewers as to ensure that that area is and continues to be effectually drained\u2019, the Director\nhad made no such order.16 Since no enforcement order had been made, the only option Mr\nMarcic had was to bring an action for judicial review against the Director or the Secretary of\nState for failing to do so, a course of action Mr Marcic did not pursue.\nTo some extent then, Lord Nicholls dismissed the case on the basis that the wrong remedy\nhad been sought; that an application should have been made for judicial review rather than\nfor damages. In practice, of course, had this path been pursued, Mr Marcic would also have\nhad little chance of success since a similar balancing exercise would have been undertaken,\nto determine whether Thames Water\u2019s action had been irrational, unlawful or patently\nunreasonable. As one commentator has noted, Mr Marcic\u2019s central argument was \u2018that he should\nhave been higher up in the queue for resources than he obviously was\u2019.17 This is naturally a\nquestion of regulatory discretion and one that would not necessarily have been altered by a court.\nOn the human rights point, the House of Lords did hold that the flooding of Mr Marcic\u2019s\nproperty fell within the first paragraph of Article 8 and also within Article 1 of the First\nProtocol. Indeed, the House of Lords confirmed that serious interference of this nature with\n11 See R v  Secretary of State for Transport, ex parte Richmond LBC (No. 2) [1995] Environmental Law\nReports, 390.\n12 At para. 141.\n13 These were payable by the Government, but were reduced from \u00a370,000 to 50,000 euros (para. 148).\n14 For a thorough discussion of the common law points see David Howarth, \u2018Nuisance and the House of\nLords: Squaring the Triangle\u2019 (2004) Journal of Environmental Law, Vol. 16(2), 233.\n15 At para. 38.\n16 As required under s. 94(1)(a).\n17 \u2018Sewerage Systems, Nuisance and Human Rights\u2019 (2004) Housing Law Monitor, Vol. 11.1(4).\nC A S E  N O T E S\nE N V  L  R E V  6  ( 2 0 0 4 )  1 9 0 \u2013 2 0 3\n199\na person\u2019s home was \u2018a prima facie violation of a person\u2019s right to respect for his private and\nfamily life (Article 8) and of his entitlement to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions\n(Article 1 of the First Protocol)\u2019. As they confirmed, the \u2018burden of justifying this interference\nrests on Thames Water\u2019.18 Nevertheless, despite this initial interpretation, the House of\nLords rejected Mr Marcic\u2019s claim under the HRA 1998, because, according to Lord Nicholls,\nwho gave the leading judgment, the same \u2018fatal weakness\u2019 affected this submission as his\nclaim in nuisance, namely, that the claim \u2018does not take sufficient account of the statutory\nscheme under which Thames Water is operating the offending sewers\u2019.\nLike Hatton then, the House of Lords in Marcic denied a susceptible individual a remedy\nbecause the regulator had to be allowed to exercise his discretion as he saw fit. It was the\nDirector\u2019s role to balance the different interests of the majority (Thames Water and sewerage\ncustomers in general) against the effects on susceptible individuals. When analysing the\ncase in the context of human rights, the question for Lord Nicholls was whether \u2018the statutory\nscheme as a whole, of which this enforcement procedure is part, [was] Convention-\ncompliant\u2019,19 a question he answered affirmatively.\nTo reach this decision, Lord Nicholls relied specifically on the 2003 decision in Hatton, noting\nthat here, the \u2018court emphasised \u201cthe fundamentally subsidiary nature\u201d of the Convention\u2019.\nIn his view:\n[n]ational authorities have \u2018direct democratic legitimation\u2019 and are in principle better placed\nthan an international court to evaluate local needs and conditions. In matters of general policy,\non which opinions within a democratic society may reasonably differ widely, \u2018the role of the\ndomestic policy maker should be given special weight\u2019 \u2026 A fair balance must be struck between\nthe interests of the individual and of the community as a whole.\nConsequently, he concluded, the balancing decisions were for the regulator to take:20 it is not\nfor the courts to intervene and protect the apparently violated property rights of the minority.\nThis was also the view of Lord Hoffman, who relied on Hatton to hold that:\nthe Convention does not accord absolute protection to property or even to residential premises.\nIt requires a fair balance to be struck between the interests of persons whose homes and property\nare affected and the interests of other people, such as customers and the general public. National\ninstitutions, and particularly the national legislature, are accorded a broad discretion in choosing\nthe solution appropriate to their own society or creating the machinery for doing so. There is no\nreason why Parliament should not entrust such decisions to an independent regulator such as the\nDirector. He is a public authority within the meaning of the 1998 Act and has a duty to act in\naccordance with Convention rights.21\nANALYSIS\nOne of the central issues raised and the clear overlap between the decisions in Marcic and\nHatton is the question of how different interests should be balanced and the way in which\nthe courts deal with economic interests on the one hand and violations of individuals\u2019 interests\n(whether or not these constitute rights under Article 8) on the other. In the context of the\nECtHR this inevitably entails a consideration of the doctrine of the margin of appreciation\nand reflection on the development of \u2018environmental rights\u2019.\n18 At para. 37.\n19 At para. 40.\n20 At para. 40.\n21 At para. 71.\nE N V I R O N M E N T A L  L A W  R E V I E W\nE N V  L  R E V  6  ( 2 0 0 4 )  1 9 0 \u2013 2 0 3\n200\nConsequently, in Hatton a crucial question for the Grand Chamber was whether it was\nlegitimate under Article 8(2) to take into account the economic interests of aircraft\noperators, passengers and the country as a whole when shaping its policy, while in Marcic\nit was the scope of the Director\u2019s discretion and the competing demands on Thames\nWater, from customers, shareholders and susceptible individuals, that was key.\nConventionally, in the ECtHR jurisprudence on Article 8, the key consideration is a\nstate\u2019s margin of appreciation, long applied to decisions on land-use. In Powell & Rayner\nv UK, for example, the claimants failed in their application for redress for the noise\nfrom Heathrow when the ECtHR held that in striking a \u2018fair balance between the competing\ninterests of the individual and of the community as a whole ... the State enjoys a certain\nmargin of appreciation in determining the steps to be taken to ensure compliance with\nthe Convention\u2019.22 The Court famously held that it was \u2018certainly not for the Commission\nor the Court to substitute for the assessment of the national authorities any other\nassessment of what might be the best policy in this difficult social and technical sphere\u2019,\nconcluding that \u2018this is an area where the Contracting States are to be recognised as enjoying\na wide margin of appreciation\u2019.23\nIn Hatton in 2003, the Grand Chamber considered the doctrine and concluded that a fair\nbalance had been struck, and did not believe (as the Chamber had found) that the nature of\nthe intrusion here called for \u2018an especially narrow scope of the State\u2019s margin of appreciation\u2019,24\nholding that:\nthe normal rule applicable to general policy decisions would seem to be pertinent here, the more\nso as this rule can be invoked even in relation to individually addressed measures taken in the\nframework of a general policy25 \u2026Whilst the State is required to give due consideration to the\nparticular interests the respect for which it is obliged to secure by virtue of Article 8, it must in\nprinciple be left a choice between different ways and means of meeting this obligation. The\nCourt\u2019s supervisory function being of a subsidiary nature, it is limited to reviewing whether or not\nthe particular solution adopted can be regarded as striking a fair balance.26\nIt was this characterisation of the Court\u2019s supervisory function as being \u2018subsidiary\u2019 that so\ncaught the eye of the House of Lords in Marcic.27\nThe problem with relying on this doctrine, as commentators have noted time and again, is\nthat there is very little certainty or consistency in the ECtHR\u2019s decision-making when it is\napplied. Greer, for example, has argued that this reliance on the margin of appreciation\ndoctrine and the principle of balancing has been the reason for the \u2018unprincipled and confused\u2019\ncase law by the ECtHR on Articles 8\u201311,28 while McHarg has claimed that reliance on the\n22 Powell and Rayner v United Kingdom (1990) 12 EHRR 355 at para. 41.\n23 At para. 44 Powell and Rayner v UK (1987) 9 EHRR 241. See also Buckley v The United Kingdom, where\nthe applicant complained that she had been denied planning permission to install a residential\ncaravan on land that she owned, (1997) 23 EHRR 101.\n24 As the Court had previously found in criminal cases, such as Dudgeon v The United Kingdom,\nconcerning sexual privacy, (1982) 4 EHRR 149.\n25 In Buckley v The United Kingdom, for example, the applicant complained that she had been denied\nplanning permission to install a residential caravan on land that she owned, (1997) 23 EHRR 101.\n26 At para. 123.\n27 Indeed, as barristers David Hart QC and Marina Wheeler have put it, the fact that the Strasbourg\ncourt\u2019s was one of a supervisory and subsidiary nature, \u2018we can hear these phrases ringing round the\nAdministrative Court for some time to come\u2019, David Hart QC and Marina Wheeler, \u2018Night Flights and\nStrasbourg\u2019s Retreat from Environmental Human Rights\u2019 (2004) Journal of Environmental Law, Vol.\n16(2), 100 at p. 134.\n28 Steven Greer, \u2018Constitutionalizing Adjudication under the European Convention on Human Rights\u2019\n(2003) OJLS Vol. 3, 405 at p. 433.\nC A S E  N O T E S\nE N V  L  R E V  6  ( 2 0 0 4 )  1 9 0 \u2013 2 0 3\n201\ndoctrine limits the Court to a reactive, rather than a proactive, role.29 In Marcic, such concerns\nwere of course rejected with a robust reference to the consequence of \u2018direct democratic\nlegitimation\u2019, a conclusion echoing Lord Nolan\u2019s previous dismissal of \u2018the obvious unsuitability\nof the courts as the arbiters in planning and related matters\u2019 in Alconbury v DETR.30\nThe problem with this balancing approach is that it appears to require a level playing-field\nfor decision-makers, where neither rights nor the public interest have priority. As both\nMcHarg and Greer have eloquently argued, this risks relegating rights to little more than\ninterests and appears to deprive the Convention of any teleological purpose, which could be\nto prioritise rights. Whether or not rights need to be \u2018trumps\u2019 is certainly still up for debate,\nyet it is certainly difficult to see the decision Hatton in 2003 as anything else but a step in\nfavour of the public interest at the expense of individual rights. The majority in the Grand\nChamber certainly rejected the Chamber\u2019s more protective approach to rights which had\nrequired states \u2018to minimise, as far as possible, the interference with [Article 8] rights, by\ntrying to find alternative solutions and by generally seeking to achieve their aims in the least\nonerous way as regards human rights\u2019,31 a conclusion Sir Brian Kerr had found so distasteful\nin his 2001 dissent. Certainly, the 2003 minority reiterated the more protective approach. As\nthey asked rhetorically: \u2018what do human rights pertaining to the privacy of the home mean\nif day and night, constantly or intermittently, it reverberates with the roar of aircraft engines?\u2019\nThey rejected the Grand Chamber\u2019s judgment as a \u2018step backwards\u2019, giving \u2018precedence to\neconomic considerations over basic health conditions in qualifying the applicants\u2019 \u201csensitivity\nto noise\u201d as that of a small minority of people\u2019, and, in their view, the \u2018trend of playing down\nsuch sensitivity \u2026 [and] turning against the current\u2019.32\nIn procedural terms this difference of opinion could add up to a dispute over who should\nbear the burden of proof, and it is clearly evident that a key difference between the two\ncourts was their willingness to accept the limited information both sides provided in support\nof their claim. Undoubtedly the Chamber in 2001 felt that although the Government had\nostensibly weighed up economic, environmental and social claims, this had not been done in\na particularly thorough way and that there was even an element of lip-service to these\nrequirements. In 2003, meanwhile, the Grand Chamber was noticeably reluctant to press\nthe Government on the economic details of their arguments, requiring no additional research\non environmental and economic policy issues, holding that although \u2018appropriate\ninvestigations and studies\u2019 must necessarily be undertaken in such contexts, \u2018this does not\nmean that decisions can only be taken if comprehensive and measurable data are available\nin relation to each and every aspect of the matter to be decided\u2019. 33 It is true that the applicants\nas well did not submit evidence disproving \u2018the Government\u2019s indications as to the \u201cobjective\u201d\ndaytime noise contour measured at each applicant\u2019s home\u2019.34 Nevertheless, although their\nharm was acknowledged, it was of course held to be insufficient to win their case.\n29 A.

In 2001, for instance, Judge Greve\nrelied in her partial dissent on the margin of appreciation doctrine to claim that this in itself\nwas sufficient authority to be reluctant to press the Government for further facts:\nThe arguments listed above in favour of a wide margin of appreciation in planning cases also have\nas a consequence that the Court ought to be reluctant to substitute its own assessment of facts in\nthese cases unless there are relatively clear and substantiated indications that the national\nauthorities have got the facts wrong. In my opinion, there are no such indications in the\npresent case which would make the Court a more competent fact-finder than the national\nauthorities.\nSimilarly, Sir Brian Kerr had been reluctant to press the Government for more information.\nIn his view, \u2018[r]equiring, as the Chamber in effect does, specific research into the extent of\nthe obvious seems to me to be placing a very substantial, and retroactive, burden on the\nGovernment\u2019. He thought this to be a particularly influential point when the policy the\napplicants are challenging is one (in his view) of macroeconomics.\nIn 2003, of course, the earlier views of both Judge Greve and Sir Brian Kerr coincided with\nthose of the majority and the evidential point was not explicitly explored again. Nevertheless,\nthe balance of proof, whether conceived in substantive or procedural terms, plainly underpins\nthe very essence of balancing. Indeed, this aspect is arguably much more critical than it at\nfirst appears. As Greer submits, perhaps the ECtHR should be subject to a \u2018requirement on\nthe defendant state to discharge a much more formal burden of proving, upon credible and\nconvincing grounds supported by reliable evidence, that interfering with the right in pursuit\nof the specific public interest in question was proportionate to a pressing social need\u2019.35 This\nmight then give greater priority to rights.\nLastly, it is worth noting that the majority in the Grand Chamber in Hatton also quashed the\ntentative approaches towards environmental rights under the ECHR, holding categorically\nthat there \u2018is no explicit right in the Convention to a clean and quiet environment\u2019, only that\n\u2018where an individual is directly and seriously affected by noise or other pollution, an issue\nmay arise under Article 8\u2019.36 Instead they held that environmental protection:\nshould be taken into consideration by Governments in acting within their margin of appreciation\nand by the Court in its review of that margin, but it would not be appropriate for the Court to\nadopt a special approach in this respect by reference to a special status of environmental human\nrights. In this context the Court must revert to the question of the scope of the margin of appreciation\navailable to the State when taking policy decisions of the kind at issue.37\nAgain the minority in 2003 disagreed. They argued that in:\nthe field of environmental human rights, which was practically unknown in 1950, the\nCommission and the Court have increasingly taken the view that Article 8 embraces the right\nto a healthy environment, and therefore to protection against pollution and nuisances caused\nby harmful chemicals, offensive smells, agents which precipitate respiratory ailments, noise\nand so on.38\n35 Steven Greer, \u2018Constitutionalizing Adjudication under the European Convention on Human Rights\u2019,\nabove, at p. 428.\n36 At para. 96.\n37 At para. 122.\n38 At para. 2 of their dissent.\nC A S E  N O T E S\nE N V  L  R E V  6  ( 2 0 0 4 )  1 9 0 \u2013 2 0 3\n203\n39 Only Judge Greve had mentioned (and dismissed) the concept in her partial dissent.\n40 At para. 97, a statement vehemently opposed by Sir Brian Kerr in his dissent, who thought it an\nunwarranted extension of the jurisprudence and one which could not be reconciled with the margin\nof appreciation doctrine.\n41 (1995) 20 EHRR 277.\n42 (1998) 26 EHRR 357.\n43 See for example, the debate between Miller and DeMerieux in M.

For a discussion of this point see David Hart QC and Marina Wheeler, \u2018Night\nFlights and Strasbourg\u2019s Retreat from Environmental Human Rights\u2019, above, at p.133.\nSimilarly, although the Chamber had declined to formulate their decision in terms of an\nenvironmental right,39 they had certainly taken a much more protective stance in 2001,\nwhen they had concluded that it was the state\u2019s duty to minimise, as far as possible, any\ninterference with Article 8 rights.40 Nevertheless, with the confirmation that no explicit\nright to environment exists, the majority in the Grand Chamber returned the discussion to\nthe conventional analysis of the issue in terms of the margin of appreciation, relying on\nrelatively narrow interpretations in Powell and Rayner and Buckley rather than taking a more\nproactive approach. By their approval of this aspect of Hatton, the House of Lords in Marcic\nmay perhaps be said to agree with this approach as well.\nAdmittedly, it is arguable to what extent the ECtHR was already developing a doctrine of\n\u2018environmental rights\u2019 under the Convention. Certainly, in Lopez Ostra v Spain41 and Guerra\nv Italy,42 the Court had found breaches of Article 8 arising from a failure of public authorities\nto control and publicise polluting activities yet commentators have differed in their views\nover whether these cases constitute the development of environmental rights,43 particularly\non the role that \u2018incompetence of the state authorities\u201944 or, as the Grand Chamber put it,\n\u2018domestic irregularity\u2019 played in the outcome of these cases.45 For the time being, however,\nit seems that the Grand Chamber\u2019s decision in Hatton has restricted such arguments and\nthat the development of environmental rights, if it was happening at all, will be less imminent\nthan it perhaps once appeared.\nAntonia Layard\nCardiff University\n"}
