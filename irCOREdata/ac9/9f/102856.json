INTRODUCTION\nExtensive efforts had been devoted in the recent decades\nto The BA-MUD techniques in CDMA systems. The BA-\nMUD becomes attractive because it requires only the in-\ntended users\u2019 information such as signatures and the timing\ndelay, while ignoring the interferers\u2019 information.\nThe canonical form of the BA-MUD had been suggested\nin [1]. By optimizing minimum output energy (MOE) of\nthe detector output, the detector parameters can be obtained\nfor AWGN channel. For its adaptive implementation, LMS\nhad been employed. Accordingly, by using a faster con-\nvergence rate and a better tracking capability filter, RLS-\nbased BA-MUD (RLS-BA-MUD) had been proposed in [2]\nfor AWGN channel and synchronous flat-fading channel.\nThis detector parameters are obtained directly from the co-\nvariance matrix of the received signal through a constraint\noptimization approach. Some performance improvement\nhad been reported. Later on, this technique had been ex-\ntended to multipath case by imposing more accurate code\nconstraints in [3],[4]. Another technique using subspace-\nbased had been investigated thoroughly in [5],[6].\nRecently, the Kalman-based BA-MUD (K-BA-MUD)\nhad been proposed for AWGN and synchronous flat-fading\nchannel in [7]. Unlike the LMS- and the RLS-BA-MUD,\nthe K-BA-MUD had been shown to have a steady-state ex-\ncess output energy (EOE) approaching zero as the number\nof sample increases in a stationary environment; if the num-\nber of sample is infinite, K-BA-MUD will have a similar\nperformance to the non-blind MMSE receiver presented in\n[8]. Most recently, K-BA-MUD had been expanded to mul-\ntipath case in [9].\nNevertheless, when the identifiability condition (IC), i.e.\nthe condition that guarantees the technique will perform, of\nK-BA-MUD is violated, then the system performance will\ndegrade. As a solution, we further develop the K-BA-MUD\nby employing multiple receiver (Rx) antennas to relax that\nIC condition. Even though the idea of exploiting the spatial-\ntemporal diversity had been investigated for subspace-based\nBA-MUD (SS-BA-MUD) in [10], it differs in which we\nconsider only a small number of data samples available.\nThis paper is organized as follows. The system model\nused throughout this paper is similar to [6] and is given in\nsection 2. In section 3, we investigate two K-BA-MUD Rx-\nstructures with multiple Rx-antennas: the Independent and\nthe Cooperative structure. An extension to the Cooperative\nstructure, a Partially Cooperative structure is proposed and\ninvestigated. The Kalman filtering is presented in section 4,\nthe performance analysis by means of computer simulation\nis given in section 5 and finally, this paper will be concluded\nin section 6.\n2. SYSTEM MODEL\nConsider a K-user asynchronous DS-CDMA system where\neach user k = {1 . . .K} is employing a single transmitter\n(Tx) antenna and base station (BS) is using Q Rx-antennas.\n0-7803-8887-9\/05\/$20.00 (c)2005 Crown Copyright\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

The\nnormalized, complex-valued signature sk(t) assigned to user\nk is supported within the interval [0, (N \u2212 1)Tc], with N =\nTs\/Tc is the processing gain. Let the channel impulse re-\nsponse (CIR) from user k to Rx-antenna q be\ng\n[q]\nk (t) =\nL\u2211\nl=1\n\u03b1\n[q]\nkl \u03b4(t\u2212 \u03c4 [q]kl ) (2)\nwhere L, \u03b1[q]kl and \u03c4\n[q]\nkl represent the number of multipath,\nthe complex-valued path gain and the path delay of channel\nfrom user k to Rx-antenna q in path l, respectively. By using\n(1) and (2), the received signal component at the Rx-antenna\nq due to user k can be written as\nr\n[q]\nk (t) =\nM\u22121\u2211\ni=0\nbk[i]Aksk(t\u2212 i.Tc \u2212 dk) \u0004 g[q]k (t)\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nh\n[q]\nk (t\u2212iTs)\n(3)\nwhere \u0004 is a convolution process and h[q]k (t) denotes the ef-\nfective signature for the corresponding channel.\nFor the sake of simplicity, it is assumed that \u03c4 [q]kl =\n\u03c4kl,\u2200q \u2208 {1, Q} and that \u03c4kl and dk are chip-synchronous.\nAnd since the received signal is in-line with chip-interval,\nthe received signal needs to be sampled only at a chip-rate.\nAllow \u03b9k = \u0003dk+\u03c4kL+TcTs \u0004 be the maximum delay spread of\nuser k, then the n-th received signal sample at Rx-antenna\nq during i-th symbol due to all users can be written as\nr[q][i, n] =\nK\u2211\nk=1\n\u03b9k\u2211\nj=0\nhk[i, n][q]bk[i\u2212 j] + \u03b7q[i, n] (4)\nwhere \u03b7q is a complex-valued zero-mean gaussian noise at\nRx-antenna q and is assumed to be locally un-correlated\nand also be independent of the received signal. Let \u03b9 =\nmaxk\u2208{1,K} \u03b9k and b1[i] be the maximum delay spread of\nall users and the desired bit, respectively. The received sig-\nnal vector during symbol period at Rx-antenna q is given by\nr[q][i] =\n[\nr[q][i, 0] . . . r[q][i,N \u2212 1]]T . Then, by stacking J\nsuccessive symbols, we define\nr[q][i] =\n[\nr[q]T [i] . . . r[q]T [i+ J \u2212 1]\n]T\n= h\u02dc\n[q]\n1 b1[i] + H\u02dc\n[q]\n1 b\u02dc1[i] +\nK\u2211\nk=2\nH\u02d8[q]k Bk[i] + \u03b7\n[q][i] (5)\nwhere h\u02dc\n[q]\n1 =\n[\nh\n[q]T\n1 [0] . . . h\n[q]T\n1 [\u03b9] 0\nT\n]T\ndenote the stacked\neffective signature for b1[i] at Rx-antenna q. The second\npart and the third part of (5) denote the corresponding ISI\nand MAI, respectively, while the fourth part is the stacked\ngaussian noise at Rx-antenna q.\n3. K-BA-MUD WITH MULTIPLE RX ANTENNAS\nIn this section, we present two receiver structures to form\nthe K-BA-MUD with multiple Rx-antennas. Since user 1\nis the intended user, a canonical form for the K-BA-MUD\ndetector, suggested in [7], can be written as\nf1[i] = h\u02dc1 \u2212H1,nullw1[i] (6)\nwhere f1[i], w1[i], and H1,null indicate the detector vector,\nthe steering vector, and the matrix that spans the null-space\nof h\u02dc1, respectively. In BS, the use of multiple Rx-antennas\nis expected and the processing power is allowed to be much\nlarger than that of the mobile terminal.\n3.1. The Independent Structure (I-K-BA-MUD)\nWith this structure, each Rx-antenna q will have its own\nK-BA-MUD detector defined in (6), f [q]1 [i]. This arrange-\nment will only exploit the spatial diversity and the Max-\nimum Likelihood (ML) decision rule for this structure is\ngiven by\nb\u02c61[i] = sign\n{\nQ\u2211\nq=1\nf [q]H1 [i]r\n[q][i]\n}\n(7)\nWe can easily see that the K-BA-MUD from each Rx-antenna\nq works exclusively to other Rx-antenna q\u02dc \u2208 {1, . . . , Q} \\\nq, therefore its performance depends solely on the ability\nof the kalman filtering procedure to detect the signal. In-\ncreasing the number of Rx-antennas will enhance the sig-\nnal power, which in turn will enhance the system perfor-\nmance. However, shall the IC of the K-BA-MUD from all\nRx-antennas is violated, increasing the number of Rx anten-\nnas will only raise the noise power, thus causing the detri-\nmental effect on system performance. Notice that this struc-\nture does not relax the IC of the K-BA-MUD.\n3.2. The Cooperative Structure\nThe Cooperative structure will exploit the spatial-temporal\ndiversity by combining all information gathered from the\nRx-antenna q = {1, . . . , Q}. By doing so, the IC of the\nK-BA-MUD will be relaxed.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on April 19,2010 at 14:51:53 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. \n3.2.1. The Fully Cooperative Structure (FC-K-BA-MUD)\nThis structure incorporates the obtained information from\nall Rx-antenna q = {1, . . . , Q} into a single K-BA-MUD\ndetector to perform signal detection. To apply this structure,\nwe define the following vectors:\nh\u02dc1[i] =\n\uf8ee\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0\nh\u02dc\n[1]\n1\n.\n.\n.\nh\u02dc\n[Q]\n1\n\uf8f9\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb ; r[i] =\n\uf8ee\uf8ef\uf8f0 r\n[1][i]\n.\n.\n.\nr[Q][i]\n\uf8f9\uf8fa\uf8fb\nand then use them in (6) to form the K-BA-MUD detector. It\nis easy to see that both the combined received signal vector\nr[i] and the combined effective signature vector h\u02dc1[i] will\nhave length of JNQ, and by using (10), the steering vector\nwill have size of JNQ too. The ML decision rule for this\narrangement is given by\nb\u02c61[i] = sign\n{\nfH1 [i]r[i]\n}\n(8)\nWith this structure, we can anticipate that the more Rx-\nantennas is employed, the bigger the steering vector size\nwill be and the longer time it needs to converge.\nIt is a general knowledge that the cooperative structure\nalways outperforms the independent structure as long as the\nnumber of data samples M tends to infinity. However, in a\nhigh data-rate wireless application where the channel may\nvary rapidly, thus only a small M is available. Therefore it\nis a challenging task for BA-MUD to achieve a good perfor-\nmance even with a small M ; the performance of BA-MUD\nis now a function of M .\n3.2.2. The Partially Cooperative Structure (PC-K-BA-MUD)\nWith a considerably small M , a more efficient configura-\ntion needs to be found, especially when the IC for a single\nRx-antenna K-BA-MUD is violated. Therefore, instead of\nutilizing all Rx-antennas available in a single K-BA-MUD,\nwe suggest to partially integrate the information gathered at\nsome Rx-antennas into clusters, hence it is named the Par-\ntially Cooperative structure. Each cluster will process the\nreceived signal independently from other clusters, while all\nRx-antenna in its corresponding cluster will process their\nreceived signal cooperatively.\nLet Lcl and Ncl = (Q\/Lcl) be the cluster\u2019s size and the\nnumber of clusters in the system. Denote\nh\u02dc1,\u03d1[i] =\n\uf8ee\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0\nh\u02dc\n[(\u03d1\u22121)\u00d7Lcl+1]\n1\n.\n.\n.\nh\u02dc\n[\u03d1\u00d7Lcl]\n1\n\uf8f9\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb ;\nr\u03d1[i] =\n\uf8ee\uf8ef\uf8f0 r\n[[(\u03d1\u22121)\u00d7Lcl+1]][i]\n.\n.\n.\nr[\u03d1\u00d7Lcl][i]\n\uf8f9\uf8fa\uf8fb\nwhere \u03d1 \u2208 {1, Lcl} denotes the cluster index. The ML de-\ncision rule for b1[i] for this structure is given by\nb\u02c61 = sign\n{\n2\u2211\ncl=1\nf [q]H1,cl [i]r\n[q]\ncl [i]\n}\n(9)\nIt is easy to inspect that by clustering only some Rx-antennas\ntogether, the steering vector will be smaller than the FC-\nK-BA-MUD\u2019s and thus, the less time needed to converge,\nprovided the IC, relaxed by integrating Ncl Rx-antennas to-\ngether in a cluster, is still not violated.\n4. KALMAN FILTERING ALGORITHM\nKalman filter has the ability to span the received signal from\nthe infinite past up to the present time. That characteristic\nmakes it the optimum filter in MMSE sense. In this section,\nwe will construct the parameters needed to form (6) and the\nprocedure for updating it.\nFrom (6), we can see that the adaptive part of the K-\nBA-MUD detector is the steering vector w1[n], whose size\ndepends on the matrix H1,null. The only requirement for\nobtaining H1,null is that h\u02dc\nH\n1 H1,null = 0. As suggested in\n[9], we can define\nH1,null = I\u2212 h\u02dc1\n(\nh\u02dc\nH\n1 h\u02dc1\n)\u22121\nh\u02dc\nH\n1 (10)\nwith this method,H1,null \u2208 C(JN\u00d7JN). We re-define h\u02dc1 =[\nhT1 0\nT\n]T\n. Let Ls be the length of h1, then the null vector\nwill have size of (JN \u2212Ls). Therefore by using h1 \u2208 CLs ,\nH1,null \u2208 CLs\u00d7Ls can be formed and the same adjustment\nneeds to be done for (6) such that all parameters have the\nsame length. This adjustment makes no loss in information,\nbecause we just remove the zeros out of the computation.\nMoreover, by reducing the size of steering vector as sug-\ngested above, we may speed up its convergence rate.\nThe detector output of the K-BA-MUD is given by\nfH1 [i]r[i]\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\ne[i]\n= h\u02dc\nH\n1 r[i]\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nr\u02dc[i]\n\u2212 rH [i]H1,null\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\ndH [i]\nw1[i]\nUnder our assumption that the CIR stays unchanged dur-\ning one frame transmission, the optimum detector defined\nin (6) will also stay constant, and so will the steering vec-\ntor w1,opt[i]. Therefore, we can define the state-transition\n(process) and measurement equation for kalman filter as fol-\nlows:\nw1,opt[i+ 1] = w1,opt[i] (11)\nr\u02dc[i] = dH [i]w1[i] + e[i] (12)\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

NUMERICAL RESULTS\nIn this section, we provide the numerical results by means of\ncomputer simulation. Before that, we present the compari-\nson of the computational complexity (in terms of number of\nmultiplication) required to update the detector parameters of\nseveral BA-MUD techniques in table 1. As we can see, the\nSS-BA-MUD [6] has the lowest computational complexity\nrequired to update its detector parameter, namely the sig-\nnal subspace, in particular when the processing gain N is\nlarge. RLS-BA-MUD [2] and K-BA-MUD [7] have simi-\nlar complexity, while the proposed K-BA-MUD has a lower\ncomplexity, especially when the maximum delay spread of\nthe intended user is much smaller than the symbol inter-\nval. Furthermore, we can see that the I-K-BA-MUD re-\nquires the smallest computational complexity, while the FC-\nK-BA-MUD is the most complex one. Note that there is a\ntrade-off between complexity and the strictness of the IC.\nThroughout the simulation, we set N = 15, CIR is 3-tap\nrayleigh fading channel, the transmission delay is uniformly\ndistributed in the interval 0, 8Tc, the number of data samples\nis M = 1500 and the intended user\u2019s signal is received with\nSNR= 10dB, or otherwise stated. The signal power is set\nto a constant A21 = 1, whilst the noise power is adjusted\n0 500 1000 1500\n10\u22123\n10\u22122\n10\u22121\n100\nNumber of Data Samples\nB\nit \nEr\nro\nr R\nat\ne \n(B\nER\n)\n5\u2212User DS\u2212CDMA (N=15, Q=1) in Mild Near\u2212Far Condition\nRLS\u2212BA\u2212MUD 10 dB\nK\u2212BA\u2212MUD 10 dB\nSS\u2212BA\u2212MUD 10 dB\nRLS\u2212BA\u2212MUD 20 dB\nSS\u2212BA\u2212MUD 20 dB\nK\u2212BA\u2212MUD 20 dB\nFig. 1. BER Performance Several BA-MUD Techniques\naccordingly. For example the noise power \u03c32 = 0.1 when\nSNR= 10dB. The results presented are the average over 200\nMonte-Carlo simulation runs.\nFirst, the simulation is run under the condition where\nthe IC of the K-BA-MUD is held. The system scenario is\na mild near-far condition, with two interferers transmitting\nwith power A22 = A23 = 10 and another interferers having\nA24 = A\n2\n5 = 100. The BER performance of three batch BA-\nMUD techniques: the RLS-BA-MUD [4], the SS-BA-MUD\n[6], and the K-BA-MUD are compared. Because the RLS-\nBA-MUD and the SS-BA-MUD depend highly on the ac-\ncuracy of the covariance matrix of the received signal while\nthe K-BA-MUD does not, therefore for fairness since the\nCIR is a priori known perfectly, we set the learning period\n(after which the error is measured)) to 100 samples to get\na good approximation of that matrix. The forgetting factor\nused in the RLS-BA-MUD and the SS-BA-MUD is 0.997.\nThe results are depicted in fig.1. For SNR= 10dB the SS-\nBA-MUD performs the best while for SNR= 20dB, the K-\nBA-MUD outperforms others. Another point to make is that\nthe K-BA-MUD tends to perform better as M increases, as\nnoted in [7], while other techniques seem to have the so-\ncalled error-floor due to the in-accuracy of the covariance\nmatrix of the received signal. Hence, for M \u2192 \u221e, we can\nexpect the K-BA-MUD to have a similar performance to the\nnon-blind MMSE receiver.\nNext, the use of multiple Rx antennas in conjunction\nwith the K-BA-MUD is simulated in the moderate near-\nfar condition (the IC is still held): A22 = 10, A23 = 100,\nA24 = A\n2\n5 = 1000. The learning period is set only to 2\nsymbols to see actual convergence rate of the K-BA-MUD.\nWe can see from fig. 2, for BS with 2 Rx-antennas, the\nI-K-BA-MUD performs better compared to the FC-K-BA-\nMUD when M \u2264 700, while after that the FC-K-BA-MUD\ndoes. For BS employing 4 Rx-antennas, with the FC-K-BA-\nMUD is expected to need much more time to perform the\ndetection, hence, is definitely inferior to other structures in\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

BER Performance K-BA-MUD with Multiple Rx-\nAntennas in an Extreme Near-Far Condition\nsmall M , hence the proposed PC-K-BA-MUD is the domi-\nnant compared to the I-K-BA-MUD after M = 450.\nFollowing, the system is set to have such an extreme\nnear-far effect condition: A22 = A23 = A24 = 10, A25 =\nA26 = 100, A\n2\n7 = A\n2\n8 = 1000, and A29 = 10000, that the IC\nis violated and the I-K-BA-MUD fails completely. From fig.\n3, it is shown that the PC-K-BA-MUD is superior to the FC-\nK-BA-MUD for rather small M . Though, we should expect\nthat the PC-K-BA-MUD is always the best as M \u2192\u221e.\n6. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, the K-BA-MUD is compared with the RLS-\nBA-MUD and the SS-BA-MUD in terms of BER perfor-\nmance with limited number of data samples M \u2264 1500.\nAs M increases, the K-BA-MUD will outperform the other\nBA-MUD techniques. Moreover, there are certain condi-\ntions where the IC of K-BA-MUD is violated. Therefore\nthe IC is relaxed by employing multiple Rx antennas in\nconjunction with the K-BA-MUD. The I-K-BA-MUD will\ngive a better performance than others, provided the IC holds\nfor a single Rx-antenna and M is very small, for example\nM \u2264 400. The proposed PC-K-BA-MUD structure will\noutperform the FC-K-BA-MUD in any condition, provided\nlimited M is considered and the IC is held in any clusters.\nFurthermore, the PC-K-BA-MUD has complexity consider-\nably lower than the FC-K-BA-MUD.\n7.
