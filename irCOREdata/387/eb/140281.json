However, the issues of \nhigh capital cost and low scalability currently prevent wider adoption of such processes. Pre-weld \nrolling aims to address these issues and can be applied easily to each component prior to fabrication. \nThe results of an initial trial are presented, and indicate that post-weld distortion can be reduced by \nan average of 38% when correct rolling parameters are used. Finally, the mechanism by which pre-\nrolling acts to modify the state of residual stress around a weld line is discussed. \nIntroduction \nResidual stress and distortion in welded joints are caused by non-uniform heating and cooling \nduring welding. Distortion problems are especially prominent whenever thin materials prone to \nbuckling are welded, and are common in the shipbuilding and aerospace industries. Many in-process \nstress reduction techniques have been investigated yielding encouraging results, including both \nthermal [1-3] and mechanical [4,5] methods. However, long-established thermal methods such as \nannealing and flame straightening are predominantly used industrially, despite being rather labour-\nintensive [6]. \n Localised rolling along or close to a weld seam as a method of residual stress reduction has been \ninvestigated sporadically since at least the 1960s [7-11], with generally very encouraging results. \nHowever it is still a rather immature technology with several outstanding issues hampering \nwidespread use. For example, local rolling involves the application of a large compressive force to a \nsmall area of the workpiece, which is necessary to achieve the substantial plastic strain required. \nConsequently the equipment required for this type of rolling is typically very large. The essential \ncomponents which comprise this are a large stiff structure to support the roller over the workpiece \nand a system, usually hydraulic, to apply the load (see Figure 1). This makes rolling unsuitable for \nuse in many applications, since it means that as-welded assemblies must be brought to the rolling \nrig, which itself cannot be made portable. \nIf a state of residual stress could be induced in components prior to welding, such that it wholly \nor partially cancelled the stress produced by the weld, there would be no need to roll the assembly \nsubsequently. Plates could be pre-rolled along the edges due to be joined, and then assembled. This \npre-rolling technique would be easy to accomplish compared with rolling either during or after \nwelding. \nMechanisms of stress formation and reduction. During welding, compressive plastic strain in \nan area surrounding the weld line is induced by a cycle of expansion, softening and constrained \ncontraction of the parent material under a non-uniform thermal field, resulting in a large tensile \nresidual stress in the longitudinal direction of the weld. In-process stress reduction techniques work \n by reducing the amount of compressive yielding ahead of the heat source and\/or inducing tensile \nplastic strain behind it, both of which counteract the thermal strain effect. For example, the use of an \nintense cooling device trailing the heat source increases the amount of tensile plastic strain behind \nit, as shown by van der Aa et al. [12]. By contrast, Global Mechanical Tensioning (GMT) involves \nthe application of a large longitudinal stretching force to the workpiece as it is welded. Again, this \nincreases tensile yielding behind the heat source, but also decreases compressive yielding in front of \nit [4]. \nThe fundamental mechanism by which rolling acts is by compressive deformation of material in \nthe direction normal to the rolled surface, which by the Poisson effect causes expansion in the in-\nplane directions. This has been used recently by Williams and coworkers [10,11,13], and previously \nby a number of others [8,9,14,15], for both in-process and post-weld deformation of material close \nto the weld line. With the exception of that by Liu et al. [15], all of these experiments have used this \nin-plane tensile yielding to either prevent or relieve longitudinal residual stresses. \nFor this study, two possible mechanisms by which pre-weld rolling could reduce post-weld \nresidual distortion in thin plate welds were proposed. Firstly, rolling produces a compressive \nresidual stress underneath the roller path. If rolling were carried out over a thin region parallel to \nand slightly removed from the weld line, then this compressive stress might be equilibrated by a \ntensile one lying partly along the weld line. This tensile stress would then have a stretching effect \nduring welding similar to that of GMT, and the consequent reduction in residual stress would \nprevent or reduce the appearance of buckling deformation. Second, the roller might introduce \nstresses which were asymmetric about the mid-plane of the plate, causing a small amount of \nbending. If aligned so as to counteract the welding-induced buckling distortion this might give an \noverall reduction in final distortion, though not a significant reduction in residual stress. \nExperimental \nRolling equipment. An experimental rolling machine was designed for a maximum rolling force \nof 200 kN; the load is applied directly to the roller axis by a hydraulic cylinder mounted vertically \nand attached to the machine's crossbeam. The workpiece is attached to the machine bed using a \nvacuum clamping system. To roll the sample, a constant force is applied and the whole crossbeam \nassembly is moved in the rolling direction by a pair of motor-driven leadscrews (see Figure 1). The \ncompressive force is monitored using a load washer between the hydraulic cylinder and the roller \nhead. The device also has an attachment for a welding torch, allowing rolling and welding to be \ncarried out with the same machine. \nMethod. To test the pre-rolling method, butt welds were made between pairs of 4mm-thick \nplates of S355 structural mild steel, with each individual plate measuring 500 x 200 mm. The \nsamples were pre-rolled prior to welding using the rolling machine designed for these experiments. \nThree basic rolling parameters were varied to assess their effect on the welded sample: the \n  \n  \n \nFigure 1: Experimental machine for single-sided rolling. 1.

Drive screw \n compressive force transmitted through the roller, the distance (yroll) between the edge of the plate \nand the centre of the roller's contact path, and whether the roller was applied to the upper or lower \nsurface of the plate. The upper surface of the plate was defined as the side from which the plate was \nwelded. \nTwo groups of samples were manufactured using pre-weld rolling in addition to ten control \nsamples which were welded without any rolling treatment. For the first, Set A, two pairs of plates \nwere welded for each of the combinations of rolling parameters in Table 2, one pair each for rolling \non the upper and lower sides. For Set B, rolling was carried out at a single combination of load and \ndistance: 200 kN at 55 mm from the weld line. Five pairs of plates were rolled on the upper side and \nfive on the lower side with these parameters. \nDuring rolling, each individual plate was held securely with a vacuum clamp as the roller passed \nover it parallel to the edge to be welded. In all cases, only a single pass of rolling was used. To \navoid damage to the clamps, the area of the plate directly underneath the path of the roller was \nbacked with a steel backing bar, which could be replaced with a copper one for use during welding. \nThe roller itself was 30 mm wide, 100 mm in diameter and made from hardened EN24 steel; the \nspeed at which it traversed the plate during rolling was 8.33 mm s\n-1\n (50 cm\/min). \nWelding parameters. After rolling, the edges to be welded were cleaned with acetone. Each pair \nof plates was tack-welded in four places to hold them together, and the samples were then joined \nalong their length using single-pass pulsed GMAW. The parameters used for this process, \nsummarised in Table 1, were designed to give full penetration of the fusion zone (where the metal \nhad been fully melted) through the whole thickness of the plate, without using a root gap separating \nthe plate edges. The welding parameters used were identical for every sample. \nDistortion measurement. To quantify the distortion present in each sample, it was placed on a \nflat measuring table and scans of the upper surface were taken using a laser measurement device \n(Romer Omega-arm and an R-Scan laser scanning head). This produced a series of measurement \npoints which was used to fit a rectangular grid of 20 x 20 mm elements over the whole of the plate's \nsurface; since each sample had nominal dimensions of 500 x 400 mm this resulted in a grid of 25 x \n20 = 400 elements and 21 x 26 = 546 nodes. The out-of-plane displacements of these nodes were \naveraged to produce a single value representing the mean distortion for each plate. \nTable 1: Welding parameters used in joining the rolled \nplate samples. \nProcess GMAW (pulsed) \nPower supply \nFronius TransPuls \nSynergic 5000 \nContact tip to work \ndistance (CTWD) \n16 mm \nTorch angle 90\u00b0 \nFiller wire diameter 1 mm \nFiller wire feed speed 242 mm s\n-1\n \nTravel speed 10.8 mm s\n-1\n \nCurrent 330 A \nVoltage 31.7 V \nGas composition \n5% CO2, 2% O2, \nbalance Ar \nGas flow rate 233 ml s\n-1\n \n \nTable 2: Rolling parameters used in Set A; for each \ncombination of load and distance one sample was \nrolled on the upper side and one on the lower. *Set B \ncontained an additional ten samples with this \ncombination: five rolled on the upper side and five on \nthe lower. \nDistance \nfrom weld line \nyroll (mm) \nLoad (kN) \n25 50 100 200 \n15 x x x  \n25 x x x  \n35 x x x  \n55   x x \n75   x  x* \n \n Results and discussion \nResults for Set A are shown in Figure 2, separated into plots for samples rolled on the upper and \nlower sides. The average out-of-plane displacement of the ten un-rolled control samples was 6.15 \nmm; this was used as a baseline against which distortion measurements from the rolled samples \ncould be compared, and is included as a horizontal chain line. For samples rolled on the upper side \n(Figure 2a) there is a slight upward trend between distortion and roller load, indicating that rolling \non this side is having a detrimental effect. However, the opposite trend is seen for samples which \nwere rolled at higher distances from the weld line (35, 55 and 75 mm) on the lower side. In all \ncases, for lower roller loads (25 and 50 kN), the distortion does not deviate significantly from the \nmean distortion of the un-rolled samples. Hence, for this material a very large load is required to \ngenerate an observable difference in distortion post-weld. \nSample Set B was used to further investigate a particular combination of rolling parameters with \ncomparison to the un-rolled state, and clarify the differences in the effect of upper and lower side \nrolling. The parameters were chosen based on the lowest-distortion result observed in Sample Set \nA: rolling at 55 mm from the plate edge, at a load of 200 kN, and on the lower side of the plate. \nFigure 3 compares the mean values of average displacement for samples rolled with these \nparameters. The difference in residual distortion between the different cases is clear: the \ndisplacement of samples rolled on the lower side is on average 38% lower than that of un-rolled \nones, while that of samples rolled on the upper side is 20% higher. Also noticeable in this figure is \nthe moderate amount of variation in residual distortion for samples processed with identical \nparameters, which indicates the need for replication if measured distortion results are to be \ncompared with computational models or used to draw strong conclusions. \nFigure 4 has been used to illustrate further the differences in distortion observed in Set B; the \ncomposite surfaces have been constructed by taking the average over the sample set of the vertical \na.  b.  \nFigure 2: Average vertical displacement of rolled plates in experimental Set A.

(Error \nbars represent the 95% \nconfidence interval of the \nmean.) \n  \n displacement at each measurement point on the sample's surface. The surface representing samples \nrolled on the lower side is visibly flatter than both the surface for un-rolled samples and the surface \nfor samples rolled on the upper side. \nIf the amount of plastic strain during rolling was approximately uniform over the plate thickness, \nthen the state of stress induced by rolling, and therefore the post-weld distortion, would be similar \nfor rolling on the upper and lower sides of the plate. However, comparison of the samples rolled on \nopposite sides in Figures 4b and 4c shows that this is not the case. A similar difference in distortion \nwas observed by Wescott [13] in post-weld rolling of a very similar material with identical \nthickness. It can therefore be concluded that there is significant through-thickness variation in \nyielding with this roller and backing bar design, during both pre- and post-weld rolling. This implies \nthat it is the bending deformation caused by this variation, rather than an overall reduction in weld-\ninduced residual stresses, that is the primary mechanism by which post-weld distortion is modified \nby pre-weld rolling. \nConclusions \nThe use of pre-weld local rolling to reduce welding-induced buckling of mild steel plate has been \ninvestigated and found to be viable: it has been demonstrated that distortion can be decreased by an \naverage of 38% using this method. With optimisation of the rolling parameters, it may well be \npossible to achieve an even more pronounced reduction. A significant force (200 kN) normal to the \nsurface of the workpiece was required to achieve the largest improvements observed during this \nstudy; for the roller geometry used here on 4 mm-thick steel samples, pre-weld rolling loads in the \nrange 0 - 100 kN were found have relatively little influence on the final distortion. \nThe pre-weld rolling process described here induces a state of residual stress in the material \nwhich varies significantly over its thickness; this was indicated by a marked difference in post-weld \ndistortion between plates which had been rolled on opposite sides. To achieve a reduction in \ndistortion it is necessary to roll on the side opposite to that from which the plate is subsequently \nwelded. It is therefore proposed that for this type of pre-weld rolling, bending deformation is the \nprimary mechanism by which the distortion is reduced, rather than any overall decrease in residual \nstress close to the weld line. Future studies will focus on modelling to better understand these \ndeformation mechanisms, on increasing the scalability of the technique, and on a variety of closely \nrelated rolling processes. \nA small amount of variation in the magnitude of buckling distortion for similar samples can be \nseen in the experimental results. Although expected due to the unstable nature of this distortion \n  \na.  b.  \nc.  \nFigure 4: Composite images representing the average \nbuckling displacements of (a) plates welded without rolling \n(b) plates rolled on the upper side (c) plates rolled on the \nlower side.
