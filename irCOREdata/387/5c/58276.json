Introduction\nThe geological complexity of many Mesozoic\u2013\nCenozoic orogens often results from the progressive\namalgamation of volcanic arcs and continental frag-\nments during oceanic closure, as well as regionally\nsignificant strike-slip displacements that arise either\nfrom the oblique nature of a collision or lateral escape\nduring orthogonal convergence (Dewey et al. 1986).\nEven in well-exposed recent orogens such as the Him-\nalayas, the magnitude of such strike-slip displacements\ncan be difficult to evaluate (e.g. Searle, Weinberg &\nDunlap, 1998; Searle, 2006), and such difficulties are\ncompounded in older, Palaeozoic and Precambrian\norogens. The Lower Palaeozoic Caledonide orogen in\nScotland and Ireland is an excellent ancient example\nof such complexity. It evolved as a result of the\nclosure of the Iapetus Ocean and the convergence\nof three continental blocks, Laurentia, Baltica and\nAvalonia (Soper, 1988; Pickering, Bassett & Siveter,\n1988; Soper et al. 1992; Dewey & Strachan, 2003).\nEarly arc\u2013continent collisions along the Laurentia\nand Baltica margins during the Ordovician were\nfollowed by final oblique continental collision during\nSilurian times. Orogen-parallel, sinistral displacements\noccurred during the final stages of collision along\nvarious structures, including the Great Glen Fault in\nScotland (Fig. 1).\nEstimates of displacements along the Great Glen\nFault are controversial because of overprinting of\n\u2217Author for correspondence: rob.strachan@port.ac.uk\nthe palaeomagnetic record and the lack of any\nunambiguous correlation across the fault of pre-\nDevonian markers. An alternative way of evaluating\nlikely displacements across such structures is by\ncomparison of the varying intensity of individual\nCaledonian events across the orogen as a means\nof reconstructing original collisional templates. The\nresults of isotopic dating have, for example, already\nprovided indications of a significant contrast in the\nintensity of Scandian (Silurian) deformational and\nmetamorphic events across the Great Glen Fault (Kinny\net al. 2003). In this paper we investigate this further and\nprovide additional evidence that the Great Glen Fault\nseparates crustal blocks with contrasting Caledonian\ntectonothermal histories.\nThe Scottish Highland Caledonides comprise a\nseries of fault-bounded terranes derived from the\nmargin of eastern Laurentia. The Great Glen Fault\nseparates the Northern Highland and Grampian\nterranes (Fig. 1). The Northern Highland terrane is\nmainly underlain by the early Neoproterozoic Moine\nSupergroup (Holdsworth, Strachan & Harris, 1994).\nIn contrast, the Grampian terrane is dominated by\nthe late Neoproterozoic to early Palaeozoic Dalradian\nSupergroup (Harris et al. 1994). A possible equivalent\nof the Moine Supergroup, the Dava succession, occurs\nin the Grampian Terrane (Highton, Hyslop & Noble,\n1999; Smith, Robertson & Rollin, 1999), but otherwise\nthere are no obvious lithostratigraphic correlations\nacross the Great Glen Fault.\nBoth the Moine and Dalradian supergroups were\ndeformed and metamorphosed during an Ordovician\n362 R.

In addition, U\u2013Pb zircon\ndating of syn-tectonic granites in east Sutherland\n(Fig. 1) has provided evidence for ductile reworking\nand associated amphibolite facies metamorphism of\nthe Moine Supergroup during the Silurian (Kinny\net al. 2003; Kocks, Strachan & Evans, 2006). This is\nattributed to the collision of the Northern Highland\nsegment of Laurentia with Baltica and correlated with\nthe Scandian event recognized in Norway (Dallmeyer\net al. 2001). The lack of any evidence for a comparable\nSilurian tectonothermal event in the Grampian terrane\nhas led to the suggestion that at that time it was\nsituated further to the southwest along the Laurentian\nmargin, remote from the Scandian collision (Dewey\n& Strachan, 2003; Kinny et al. 2003). It has been\nconcluded that at least 700 km of subsequent sinistral\ndisplacement along the Great Glen Fault would have\nbeen necessary to bring the Grampian terrane to its\npresent location relative to the Northern Highland\nterrane (Dewey & Strachan, 2003).\nIn this paper we review briefly the Caledonian\nevolution of the Moine rocks of West Inverness-shire\n(Fig. 1) and present the results of a geochronological\nstudy of the Glen Scaddle Metagabbro (Bailey &\nMaufe, 1916; Drever, 1940). The structural setting of\nthis intrusion was established by Stoker (1983; M.\nStoker, unpub. Ph.D. thesis, Univ. Liverpool, 1980)\nand confirmed during recent fieldwork by one of us\n(RAS).\n2. Geological setting\nThe Moine rocks of West Inverness-shire comprise\nthe Morar, Glenfinnan and Loch Eil groups (Fig. 1;\nHoldsworth, Strachan & Harris, 1994). The Morar\nGroup lies within the Moine Nappe, and the Glenfinnan\nand Loch Eil groups within the Sgurr Beag Nappe\n(Powell et al. 1981; Barr, Holdsworth & Roberts, 1986).\nThe upper part of the Sgurr Beag Nappe is dominated\nby mainly unmigmatized psammites and quartzites of\nthe Loch Eil Group (Stoker, 1983; Strachan, 1985). The\nbase of the Loch Eil Group passes transitionally into the\nunderlying migmatitic pelites and thinly interbanded\npsammites and semi-pelites of the Glenfinnan Group.\nA lower limit for deposition of the Glenfinnan and Loch\nEil groups is provided by the c. 1000\u2013950 Ma ages\nof the youngest detrital zircons incorporated within\nthe metasediments (Friend et al. 2003; Cawood et al.\n2004). The West Highland Granitic Gneiss suite,\nprominent members of which crop out in Ardgour, at\nFort Augustus and at Glen Doe (Fig. 1), was emplaced\nat c. 870 Ma (Friend et al. 1997; Rogers et al. 2001).\nThe current consensus is that this probably represents\nan early rift-related igneous suite, broadly coeval with\nintrusion of amphibolites and meta-gabbros that record\nall the tectonothermal events present in their Moine\nhost rocks (Millar, 1999; Dalziel & Soper, 2001).\nThe Moine rocks of the Loch Eil Group in\nWest Inverness-shire record four main phases of\ndeformation (Strachan, 1985; see also Dalziel, 1966\nand Stoker, 1983). Early minor isoclinal folding (D1)\nwas associated with formation of an S1 schistosity\nthat developed under amphibolite facies conditions.\nElsewhere in West Inverness-shire (E. K. Hyslop,\nunpub. Ph.D. thesis, Univ. Hull, 1992; Rogers et al.\n1998; Vance, Strachan & Jones, 1998; Tanner & Evans,\n2003), a mid-Neoproterozoic (820\u2013730 Ma) age has\nbeen demonstrated for early folding, amphibolite-\nfacies metamorphism and segregation of dated syn-\nmetamorphic pegmatites at Ardnish, Sgurr Breac,\nKnoydart, Loch Eilt and Carn Gorm (Fig. 1). A\nsimilar age is assumed for D1 in the Loch Eil Group.\nA subsequent phase of widespread minor tight to\nisoclinal folding (D2) resulted in formation of a\ncomposite S0\/S1\/S2 foliation (Strachan, 1985). The\nfoliation carries a stretching and mineral lineation\nScandian deformation in northern Scotland 363\nFigure 2.

These structures are correlated with\nthe D2 folds and associated fabrics recognized in\nthe northern outcrop of the Loch Eil Group east of\nLoch Quoich (Fig. 1; Holdsworth & Roberts, 1984).\nTitanites aligned within the composite S1\/S2 foliation\nwithin the Fort Augustus Granite Gneiss (Fig. 1) have\nyielded a U\u2013Pb age of 470 \u00b1 1 Ma, suggesting that\nD2 occurred during the Ordovician Grampian orogenic\nevent (Rogers et al. 2001).\nThe large-scale structural geology of the southern\nLoch Eil Group is dominated by major upright D3\nand D4 folds (Fig. 2; Strachan, 1985). D3 folds are all\nupward-facing and plunge towards the Great Glen, with\nthe result that younger rocks come on to the east. Folds\nare open to close in style, and an S3 mica schistosity\n(locally with fibrolite) is locally developed axial-\nplanar to D3 folds. The refolding of D3 folds during\nD4 generated a regional-scale interference pattern\n(Fig. 2). D4 folds are gentle to open, and vary in\ntrend from north\u2013south in the area north of Loch Eil\nto NNE\u2013SSW in Ardgour; an axial-planar crenulation\nfabric (S4) is widespread. Fibrolite, hornblende and\nbiotite all recrystallize around S4 crenulations, and it\nis therefore concluded that D4 was characterized by\namphibolite-faces conditions. D4 folding increases in\nintensity westwards to form the Northern Highland\nSteep Belt (Figs 2, 3; Roberts & Harris, 1983).\nThe prevailing view has been that the upright folds\nand associated metamorphic assemblages formed at a\nlate stage of the Ordovician Grampian orogenic event\n(e.g. Kelley & Powell, 1985; Powell & Phillips, 1985;\nHarris, 1995). A lower limit for the formation of the\nsteep belt is provided by the intrusion of the pre-D4\nGlen Dessary Syenite (Fig. 1) at 456 \u00b1 5 Ma (U\u2013Pb\nFigure 3.

STRACHAN & J. A. EVANS\nFigure 4. Composite cross-section across the Glen Scaddle Metagabbro and its Moine country rocks to illustrate the nature of the\nmajor D3 folds and the structural setting of the intrusion in the core of the Glen Scaddle Synform (modified from Stoker, 1983). The\nintrusion carries a moderately to steeply dipping foliation that is axial-planar to the Glen Scaddle Synfom. Note that the Glen Gour\nMetagabbro to the southwest occupies a lower structural level, in the core of the D3 Glen Gour Antiform. The Moine succession is\nright-way-up. See Figure 2 for line of section; abbreviations for folds as in Figure 2.\nzircon: van Breemen et al. 1979; Roberts, Smith &\nHarris, 1984). An upper limit is apparently provided\nby a U\u2013Pb monazite age of 450 \u00b1 10 Ma obtained\nfrom a pegmatite sampled within the steep belt west\nof Glenfinnan and thought to pre-date upright folding\n(van Breemen, Pidgeon & Johnson, 1974). According\nto Powell & Phillips (1985), formation of the steep belt\nwas followed by a prolonged period of post-tectonic\ncooling from c. 453 Ma to c. 405 Ma. The southern\npart of the steep belt is cut by the Strontian Granite that\nwas intruded at 425 \u00b1 3 Ma (Fig. 1; Rogers & Dunning,\n1991). Most of the intrusion is unmetamorphosed and\ndominated by pre-full-crystallization magmatic fabrics\n(Hutton, 1988).\nReappraisal of this interpretation is appropriate\nbecause the Grampian event is now thought to have\nbeen short-lived (c. 480\u2013465 Ma) and followed by very\nrapid exhumation (Oliver et al. 2000). Furthermore,\nKinny et al. (2003) have demonstrated widespread\nSilurian ductile deformation and amphibolite-facies\nmetamorphism in the Moines of central and west\nSutherland. Upright folds of the steep belt in northern\nRoss-shire (Fig. 1) deform lineations within the Morar\nGroup that have been correlated with the Silurian\nfabrics identified in central Sutherland (Kinny et al.\n2003). Either regional correlations of structures are in\nerror or the published upper limit on the age of the\nsteep belt (van Breemen, Pidgeon & Johnson, 1974)\nis less robust than thought previously. In an effort to\nplace further constraints on the age of upright folding,\nwe now focus on the geology of eastern Ardgour, with\nparticular reference to the structural setting and U\u2013\nPb geochronology of the Glen Scaddle Metagabbro\n(Fig. 1).\n3. Geology of the Glen Scaddle Metagabbro\n3.a. Structural setting and contact relationships\nThe Glen Scaddle Metagabbro intrudes the Moine\nrocks of the Loch Eil Group (Stoker, 1983; Strachan,\n1985). In eastern Ardgour these comprise a varied\nsuccession of psammites and quartzites which are\nmostly right-way-up where sedimentary structures are\npresent. The structure of eastern Ardgour is dominated\nby upright to moderately inclined, tight to close D3 folds\n(Figs 2, 4). The Glen Scaddle Metagabbro occupies the\ncore of a major D3 fold, the Glen Scaddle Synform,\nflanked to the northeast by the D3 Meall an Feidh\nAntiform and to the southwest by the D3 Glen Gour\nAntiform (Figs 2, 4). A smaller intrusion, the Glen\nGour Metagabbro, occupies the core of the Glen Gour\nAntiform (Fig. 4) and is apparently at a lower structural\nlevel than the Glen Scaddle Metagabbro.\nThe margins of the Glen Scaddle Metagabbro are\nbroadly parallel to the regional composite S0\/S1\/S2\nfoliation within host Moine psammites. Contacts with\nMoine rocks are generally concordant and sharp [e.g.\nNN 0050 6920]. Small xenoliths (10\u201350 cm) of Moine\nlithologies are locally common within the marginal\nfacies of the intrusion [e.g. NM 9662 7004]. Within\na narrow (0.75\u20131 km) aureole developed within the\nMoine rocks, regional metamorphic assemblages are\noverprinted by contact metamorphic minerals (Drever,\n1940; Ashworth & Chinner, 1978). Quartz\u2013feldspar\u2013\nbiotite rocks that are interpreted as nebulitic migmatites\nformed from the partial melting and mobilization\nof Moine lithologies are locally developed on the\ndecametre scale along the northeast contact of the\nGlen Scaddle body [e.g. NM 9656 7012]. These\nScandian deformation in northern Scotland 365\nare characterized by disoriented xenoliths of Moine\npsammites that apparently resisted melting, as well as\nzones of complex disharmonic folding.\n3.b. Meta-igneous lithologies\nThe most common rock type is a medium- to coarse-\ngrained, foliated metagabbro. Subordinate meta-\nigneous rock types range from ultrabasic to acidic\nin composition. Foliated hornblende peridotite and\nserpentinite were recorded by Drever (1940) from the\nmargins of the Glen Gour and Glen Scaddle intrusions.\nAlso present within the metagabbro are concordant\nmetre-scale sheets of fine-grained hornblende schist\nand at least two phases of fine- to medium-grained\ngranitic veins that are mainly developed on the\ncentimetre\u2013decimetre scale but can range up to 2\u2013\n3 m in thickness. The earliest (meta)granitic veins are\nfoliated and locally associated with hornblende schist;\ncomplex textures indicative of mingling between the\ntwo parent magmas are sometimes preserved [e.g. NM\n9965 6856]. The later granitic veins are generally\nunfoliated and discordant, locally forming ramifying\nnetworks that cross-cut host meta-igneous lithologies.\n3.c. Petrology and microfabrics\nRelic igneous mineralogies and textures are best\npreserved in rare areas of low tectonic strain up\nto several hundred metres wide [e.g. River Scaddle,\nNM 9814 6818] and it is appropriate to describe\nthese first before outlining the effects of superimposed\ndeformation and metamorphism. In low strain zones,\nthe metagabbro is essentially undeformed and typically\nconsists of hypersthene, clinopyroxene, plagioclase\n(An35\u201340) and amphibole with minor quartz, biotite\nand accessory ilmenite, titanite and apatite. Feldspars\nare rectangular and randomly oriented. Pyroxene is\nmostly replaced partially to completely by uralitic\namphibole, and this is interpreted to be the result of late\nstage deuteric alteration within the igneous protolith\n(Stoker, 1983). Feldspar is commonly highly altered\nand sericitized. Sub-ophitic textures are common, as\nare symplectic intergrowths between pyroxene and\nplagioclase. The effects of apparently static meta-\nmorphism are represented by the recrystallization of\namphibole into granoblastic aggregates of hornblende,\nand the growth of radiating mats of biotite. M. Stoker\n(unpub. Ph.D. thesis, Univ. Liverpool, 1980) recorded\na local crude rhythmic layering in metagabbro [e.g.\nNM 9945 6850] shown by gradation of melanocratic\nto leucocratic gabbroic types on scales of up to\nseveral metres. Low strain areas of metagabbro\nlocally contain metre-scale mafic enclaves [e.g. NM\n9852 6827] and are intruded by undeformed granitic\nsheets.\nAreas of low tectonic strain pass transitionally into\nthe foliated metagabbro that forms the bulk of the in-\nFigure 5.

The relic igneous features described above are\nprogressively replaced by a penetrative amphibolite-\nfacies deformation fabric defined by aligned layers of\nintergrown hornblende and biotite that wrap augen\nof recrystallized plagioclase (Fig. 5). The mafic\nenclaves and the undeformed granites present in the\nlow strain zones are interpreted as the protoliths\nof, respectively, the hornblende schists and the early\nfoliated granitic veins within the foliated metagabbro.\nWithin the hornblende schists, the foliation is defined\nby a penetrative alignment of fine-grained hornblende\nand recrystallized feldspar. The early granitic veins\nare characterized by an intense mylonitic fabric:\nclassic mortar texture is displayed by ribbons of\ndynamically recrystallized quartz that wrap feldspar\naugen (Fig. 6). Feldspar porphyroclasts are sometimes\nfringed by myrmekite which is probably strain-induced\n(Fig. 6).\n366 R. A. STRACHAN & J. A. EVANS\n3.d. Structure and age of emplacement\nAlong the margins of the Glen Scaddle Metagabbro,\nthe foliation described above is broadly parallel to\nthe contact with host Moine rocks. However, within\nthe intrusion the foliation is more uniform in orient-\nation, trending approximately NW\u2013SE and dipping\nmoderately to steeply to the northeast. A moderately\nplunging mineral and extension lineation is defined\nlocally by alignment of hornblende\u2013biotite aggregates\nand plagioclase augen [e.g. NM 9965 6856].\nThe following two observations establish that intru-\nsion post-dated the early fabric-forming events D1 and\nD2. Firstly, within the aureole around the Glen Scaddle\nMetagabbro, syn-D1 peak regional metamorphic as-\nsemblages are overprinted by contact metamorphic\nminerals, including sillimanite, biotite, plagioclase,\nquartz, K-feldspar, cordierite and andalusite which\nhave been reported from various samples of pelite\n(Ashworth & Chinner, 1978; Stoker, 1983). Secondly,\nthe intrusion locally incorporates xenoliths that contain\nisoclinal folds that are most probably D2 in age [e.g.\nNM 9680 6835].\nA pre-D3 age of emplacement is consistent with the\nbroad parallelism of the metamorphic foliation in the\nintrusion to the axial plane of the D3 Glen Scaddle\nSynform, and the observation that contact metamorphic\nsillimanite is wrapped by the S3 fabric (Stoker, 1983).\nFurthermore, the Glen Scaddle Synform is defined\nwithin the intrusion by the orientation of primary\nlayering which is folded by NW-trending upright folds\nthat are equated with the D3 folds developed within\nthe host Moine rocks (Stoker, 1983). Local structural\ncomplexity within the core of the synform is indicated\nby the observation that the foliation in the metagabbro\nand the mylonitic fabric within early granite veins\nare also locally deformed by tight, steeply plunging\nD3 folds [e.g. NM 9965 6856]. M. Stoker (unpub.\nPh.D. thesis, Univ. Liverpool, 1980) interpreted this\ncomplexity as indicating that D3 was locally polyphase.\nA pre-D4 age of intrusion is certain because the\nfoliation is deformed and crenulated by NE\u2013SW-\ntrending open folds that are correlated with regional\nfolds of this age within the Moine country rocks. A\nmesoscopic D4 fold pair deforms the Glen Gour body\nand the southeasternmost part of the Glen Scaddle\nMetagabbro (Fig. 2; Stoker, 1983).\n3.e. Summary\nIt is therefore concluded, following Stoker (1983),\nthat the Glen Scaddle Metagabbro was emplaced\nafter D2, probably as a series of sills that were\nconcordant with the regional S0\/S1\/S2 foliation within\nhost Moine rocks. This foliation was probably flat-lying\nafter D2. The generalized gradation from ultrabasic\nrocks at the margins of the Glen Scaddle and Glen\nGour intrusions to basic and acidic rocks centrally\nFigure 7. Hand specimen of foliated metagabbro sampled for\nisotopic dating in this study.\nsuggests that they may represent differentiated layered\nsheet intrusions. The intrusion was then deformed\nand metamorphosed during D3 and D4. The structural\nevidence therefore indicates that the Glen Scaddle\nMetagabbro is an important marker within the regional\ntectonometamorphic sequence; its age places a lower\nlimit on the timing of regional upright folding and\nassociated amphibolite-facies metamorphism.\n4. U\u2013Pb geochronology\n4.a. Sample preparation procedure and analytical\ntechniques\nThe sample analysed was a medium-grained, foliated\nmetagabbro (Fig. 7) collected from the River Scaddle\n[NN 0004 6869]. A sample of 30 kg was crushed\nand milled, and the less than 400 \u00b5 fraction sieved\nout. Heavy mineral concentrations were obtained using\na Gemini shaking table, followed by a superpan-\nner. A separate, with specific gravity greater than\n3.3 gm ml\u22121, was recovered using Di-iodomethane.\nThe minerals were then separated magnetically using a\nFrantz LB-1 magnetic separator. The recovered zircons\nfrom the non-magnetic \u223c 1.8 Amp fraction were hand-\npicked under alcohol and abraded. The majority of\nthe zircons in the sample were fragments of quite\nlarge grains (about 150 \u00b5 length). The fragments were\npredominantly clear with sharp terminations and edges\nwhere visible. A few showed elongate melt inclusions\nand these were avoided during picking.\nU and Pb separations followed the procedures of\nKrogh (1973) with minor modifications of Corfu &\nAyres (1984). Zircon grains were analysed on a VG 354\nmass spectrometer at the NERC Isotope Geosciences\nLaboratory following the procedures of Noble, Tucker\n& Pharaoh (1993). Chemistry blanks were \u223c 5 pg,\nand these were monitored in each batch of chemistry.\nScandian deformation in northern Scotland 367\nFigure 8. U\u2013Pb concordant ages from the Glen Scaddle\nmetagabbro. The MSWD is of concordance and equivalence\nat 2\u03c3 and takes into account errors on the decay constant. The\nlabelled ellipse is the weighted mean error ellipse of the three\ndata points.\nUranium blanks contained < 0.1 pg U. All results\nand errors were calculated following the methods of\nLudwig (1993, 1994), and the Pb isotope ratios were\ncorrected for initial common Pb in excess of laboratory\nblank using the model of Stacey & Kramers (1975).\nAges were calculated using the decay constants of\nJaffey et al. (1971).\n4.b. Results\nThree zircon fractions plot either on or close to\nconcordia and give an age of 426 \u00b1 3 Ma (Fig. 8;\nTable 1). This age is interpreted to date closely igneous\ncrystallization of the Glen Scaddle Metagabbro.\n5. Discussion\n5.a. Age of polyphase upright folding in the SWMoine\nThe U\u2013Pb zircon age of 426 \u00b1 3 Ma reported here\nfor the emplacement of the Glen Scaddle Metagabbro\nsuggests that this intrusion is a basic member of\nthe late Caledonian \u2018Newer Granite\u2019 suite (Read,\n1961; Stephenson et al. 1999, and references therein).\nMore importantly, in combination with the structural\nhistory outlined here, as well as the 425 \u00b1 3 Ma\nage for the Strontian Granite located only a few\nkilometres to the south, it implies a very different\nregional tectonometamorphic history for the Moine\nSupergroup in West Inverness-shire and Ross-shire to\nthat currently published. Regional-scale D3\u2013D4 upright\nfolding, including the formation of the Northern\nHighland Steep Belt, must have occurred during a\nrelatively short (Scandian) orogenic event. Western\nparts of the Strontian Granite are overprinted by locally\ndeveloped steep, N\u2013S-trending solid-state deformation\nfabrics (Hutton, 1988), and it is therefore possible\nthat granite emplacement overlapped final stages of\nD4 folding.

A. STRACHAN & J. A. EVANS\nA younger age for regional upright folding than\nthe Ordovician age proposed previously resolves the\napparently contradictory structural relationships in\nRoss-shire, where steep belt folds deform structures\nassigned to the Scandian event (Kinny et al. 2003).\nHowever, a Silurian age for the formation of the\nNorthern Highland Steep Belt is in contradiction to\nthe U\u2013Pb monazite age of 450 \u00b1 10 Ma obtained from\na pegmatite west of Glenfinnan that was interpreted\nto post-date upright folding (van Breemen, Pidgeon\n& Johnson, 1974). The exact significance of this age\nis difficult to evaluate, partly due to the lack of a\ndetailed field description of the dated pegmatite and its\nstructural setting, but also because of the possibility that\nthe dated monazites included an unrecognized inherited\ncomponent. We consider the new age constraints\nreported here on the age of regional upright folding\nmore reliable, although the structural setting and age\nof pegmatites within the steep belt clearly deserves\nreinvestigation.\n5.b. Implications for late-orogenic displacements along the\nGreat Glen Fault\nA Silurian age for regional, polyphase upright folding\nand associated amphibolite-facies metamorphism of\nthe Moine Supergroup is consistent with the current\nmodel for Caledonian orogenic activity in the Northern\nHighland terrane, involving Grampian (470\u2013460 Ma)\nand Scandian (435\u2013425 Ma) events (Kinny et al. 1999,\n2003; Friend, Jones & Burns, 2000; Dallmeyer et al.\n2001). The new evidence reported here, in combination\nwith the findings of Kinny et al. (2003), demonstrates\nwidespread reworking of Grampian structures and\nmetamorphic assemblages during the Scandian event.\nThis culminated in development of the Moine Thrust\nZone and emplacement of the Moine rocks onto the\nLaurentian foreland. The Northern Highland Steep\nBelt is thought to have formed at the same time\nand presumably detaches at depth on a ductile thrust\nzone, probably the Moine Thrust (Barr, Holdsworth &\nRoberts, 1986).\nThe tectonothermal history detailed above is in\nmarked contrast to that recorded by the Dalradian\nSupergroup southeast of the Great Glen Fault, where\nthe main phases of folding and associated regional\nmetamorphism are assigned entirely to the Ordovician\nGrampian orogenic event. The present consensus is\nthat the peak of Grampian metamorphism in the\nDalradian rocks occurred at c. 470 Ma and was\nfollowed by cooling and uplift relatively soon thereafter\nat c. 460 Ma (Dempster, 1985; Dempster, Hudson &\nRogers, 1995; Dempster et al. 2002; Soper, Ryan\n& Dewey, 1999; Oliver et al. 2000; Oliver 2001;\nBaxter, Ague & DePaulo, 2002). As yet, there is no\nevidence that the Dalradian Supergroup was affected\nby regionally significant Silurian deformation or meta-\nmorphism. The conclusions reported here therefore\nreinforce tectonic models that invoke a minimum of\n700 km of late Caledonian (425\u2013390 Ma?) sinistral\nmovement along the Great Glen Fault in order\nto juxtapose the Grampian and Northern Highland\nterranes following the Scandian collision between\nBaltica and the Northern Highland segment of eastern\nLaurentia (Dewey & Strachan, 2003; Kinny et al.\n2003).\n6. Conclusions\n(1) The Glen Scaddle Metagabbro forms a valuable\ntime marker within the Northern Highland\nTerrane of the Scottish Caledonides because its\nage places a lower limit on the timing of regional\nupright folding and associated amphibolite-\nfacies metamorphism.\n(2) The intrusion has yielded a U\u2013Pb zircon age of\n426 \u00b1 3 Ma that is interpreted to date its igneous\ncrystallization.\n(3) Regional-scale D3 and D4 upright folding of the\nintrusion and its Moine host rocks, including\nformation of the Northern Highland Steep\nBelt, occurred during a relatively short Silurian\n(= Scandian) orogenic event. Final stages of D4\ndeformation may have overlapped emplacement\nof the Strontian Granite, dated previously at\n425 \u00b1 3 Ma.\n(4) The data reported here provide further evidence\nfor widespread Silurian ductile deformation and\namphibolite-facies metamorphism northwest of\nthe Great Glen Fault; the apparent absence of\nthis orogenic event within the adjacent Grampian\nTerrane reinforces arguments that this structure\nseparates crustal blocks with contrasting Caledo-\nnian tectonothermal histories.\n(5) These differences support tectonic models that\ninvoke a minimum of 700 km late Caledonian\nsinistral movement along the Great Glen Fault in\norder to juxtapose the Grampian and Northern\nHighland terranes following the Scandian colli-\nsion.\n(6) This study therefore shows how comparison of\nthe varying intensities of deformational events\nacross an orogen can be used to reconstruct\noriginal collisional templates and constrain likely\ndisplacements along late-orogenic transcurrent\nfaults.\nAcknowledgements.
