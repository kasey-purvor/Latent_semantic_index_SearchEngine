Kirby, R McAndrew, A. Kilgour, H. Taylor and J. T. Mayes\nICBL, Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh\nAs the world-wide computer network becomes ubiquitous, new tools have been developed, such as\nthe World Wide Web (WWW), for the delivery of multimedia hypertext-based documents.\nSimilarly, there has been an explosion in the amount of email, bulletin boards, and Usenet News\navailable. This has led to a major problem of information overload: we are slowly but surely being\noverwhelmed by the amount of information available to us.\nTo address this problem, the New Technology Initiative (NTI) of the Joint Information Systems\nCommittee (JISC) is funding the ELF project over a period of two years to develop a tool, the\nElectronic Learning Facilitator. This tool is aimed at assisting learners to make effective use of\nthe information available. The ELF project started in December 1993, with the goal of producing\na tool for installation in UK academic sites.\nThis paper first discusses the new networked information sources that are appearing around the\nglobe, and then analyses the requirements of learners for accessing this information. From the\nrequirements, the paper shows the desirable features of an ELF, such as monitoring the user at\nwork to gain hints as to what he or she is doing, being guided by the user directly, and using\ninformation gathered from other ELFs, or from monitoring the various information sources for\nannouncements of new services, updates of information, etc.\nThe main body of the paper illustrates the current progress on the project, outlining the\nimplementation of the ELF- ELF is written using various high-level languages such as the Tool\nCommand Language (TCL) and Perl, as well as the more traditional C++. It consists of various\nagents, each agent having a specific task to perform, such as monitoring a WWW site for any new\ndocuments, or monitoring a Usenet Newsgroup for articles that might be of particular interest to\nthe owner of the agent. Finally, the paper reports on our plans to test users on a prototype.\nIntroduction\nRecent years have seen an unprecedented increase in the use of the Internet and other\n69\nR KJrby et al. ELF: the Electronic Learning Facilitator\nglobal networks of computers. We have seen estimates of between 100,000 and 1,000,000\nnew users each month joining the Internet. Predominantly these are information seekers,\nbut the figures do also represent a significant increase in the number of information\nproviders. For learners, we now have a significant set of information sources, albeit\nobscured by a lot of noise.\nThere are many different types of information sources now available, all with varying\nattributes. For many years, the Internet has provided email. For learners, this has allowed\ndirect contact with the authors of research papers at different (and sometimes the same!)\ninstitutions. The Usenet News system has enabled learners to reach a far wider audience,\nwith less intrusion (since it is up to each user to decide to read the news, whereas email is\ngenerally always read). Again, this provides a good resource for the learner to find out\nmore by asking questions and receiving a wide variety of responses, although often this\nrequires wading through a variety of 'me-too' responses, and flames (inflammatory\nresponses which tend to solicit ad hominem attacks). Electronic mailing lists are the email\nequivalent of a newsgroup, although they are harder to find out about, but tend to have\nless noise. FTP sites are another, now familiar, information source. Here electronic copies\nof research papers can be stored at an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) site and others can\nthen download (copy) them to their local machine for printing and reading. This is a rich\nsource of information in the sense that there is rarely any noise stored at an FTP site, but\nit is hard to know where to look and what to look for,.except from some other\ninformation source (such as a News article).\nRecently, new types of information sources, such as the World Wide Web (WWW),\nGopher, and the Wide Area Information Servers (WAIS) databases have proliferated\n(Berners-Lee et ai, 1992). Gopher can be viewed as a distributed menu system, where users\nselect items on a menu which may lead to another menu, or to some actual information\n(such as a picture or a research paper). The WWW is a distributed hypertext system where\nlinks to objects are embedded within other objects (where the objects can be text, pictures,\nvideo, and other multimedia). Both Gopher and the WWW support the browsing model;\nthe user has actively to follow links to find information, in contrast to email or News\nwhere the user passively receives information. WAIS databases are essentially free-text\nsearch engines which allow for keyword searching of collections of documents.\nThe increase in the desire to use these networks, and the increase in the amount of\ninformation being made available over them, is causing problems for both experienced\nand novice users. This paper will introduce the problems, outline a possible solution, and\nend with an indication of current progress.\nProblems\nInformation sources such as mailing lists and Usenet tend to overwhelm users with the\nsheer volume of information, often with a low ratio of signal to noise. Both can be\nthought of as unsolicited information, where the user must invest large amounts of time\nin reading to find the nuggets of useful information. By contrast, users of the WWW\n70\nAn-j Volume 3 Number I\noften have a different problem, that of navigation, by which we mean knowing where the\ndesired information is to be found. With WAIS databases, the problem is similar:\nknowing which database to search. There is a directory-of-servers (a database consisting\nof short descriptions about a large set of registered databases) to help with this, but as\nwith any centralized solution, it can be tied up with the multitude of requests from users\naround the world. It is also not complete nor up to date.\nOur current work is predicated on the belief that there is useful information in all these\ninformation sources, but the trick is to know where to look. For example, one often finds\nout about new WWW sites from the WWW Newsgroups. Another major source of\npointers to useful sites is from colleagues. There are also index sites which build a\ndatabase of pointers to other sites using some keyword mechanism to act as the key into\nthe database. These include the WAIS directory-of-servers, and there are several others\non the WWW (such as the Jumpstation, and the WWW Worm).\nA solution - ELF\nELF is an attempt to address these problems. It is essentially a collection of agents which\nco-operate together to aid users in finding information of relevance to their interests or\ntasks, in a timely and efficient manner. One of the main aims of this project is for ELF to\nwork without explicitly requiring direct control by the user. To do this, ELF monitors the\nuser at work to determine (from files recently edited, for example) the areas of current\ninterest. ELF attempts to categorize the current work by a few keywords which are then\nused to seed a search conducted by various agents. The results of this search are presented\nto the user at some appropriate point (to avoid unnecessary interruptions in the user's\ncurrent task). ELF can also be controlled directly by the user. This means that the user\ncontrols what information sources are searched, and decides on the search query terms.\nThere are two major sides to ELF. The first handles the user, and attempts to gain\nknowledge about his or her tasks. The second is a back-end which consists of agents that\n'know' how to query and search the various information sources. We will discuss each of\nthese parts of ELF in more detail below.\nELF allows for varying interaction with the user. The minimal level of interaction\ninvolves a discrete icon on the screen from which various control panels can be accessed.\nThe only other ELF tool that needs to be seen is called PrISM (Personal Information\nSpace Manager). This is a hierarchical structuring tool which can be used as a simple\nfile\/directory browser, but can allow for grouping together related tasks. PrISM allows\naccess to the keywords that ELF calculates for a directory or file, and provides for the\nuser to edit these. Users can also use PrISM to determine and control which agents are\ncurrently working on their behalf. While it is indeed true that the hierarchical structuring\nmodel leaves a lot to be desired, it is easy to understand, and matches naturally to the\ncommon computer file system.\nELF provides several different mechanisms for notifying search results. In the case where\na search finishes and the user is currently logged on, ELF can notify by forcing Mosaic\n71\nR. Kirby et al. ELF: the Electronic Learning Facilitator\n(or certain other WWW browsers) to pop up on the screen with a page containing\npointers to the results found, using the fact that Mosaic can access most types of\ninformation sources, thus providing a simple click-to-access interface to the results.\nAnother option is to indicate within PrISM the presence of results at the relevant part of\nthe hierarchical structure. A third option is to provide an xbiff type program (xbiff is a\nsmall icon that notifies the arrival of new mail by changing colour) to flag the arrival of\nresults. These clearly vary in intrusiveness to the user, from the popping-up Mosaic to the\nsmall discrete icon in the corner of the screen.\nIf the user is currently logged off when the results arrive, ELF can either send a mail\nmessage containing the pointers to the results, or allow for PrISM to indicate the presence\nof results the next time the user logs on.\nMore experienced users can control ELF directly, using search parameters, and\nrequesting immediate searches (cf. traditional database searching where the user makes a\nquery and waits for the result). ELF also collects statistics about which keywords seem to\nwork best, and which information sources produce the best results (as selected by the\nuser). These can then be used either by ELF or the user to tailor the searching to fit in\nmore with the working practices of the user.\nThe back-end of ELF consists of the agents that perform the actual searching of the\nvarious information sources. One agent (called the News agent) is responsible for\nquerying a database of news articles. One of its responsibilities is to find articles that\nannounce new WWW sites. This is done in a simple way by looking for ANNOUNCE (or\nsome derivative), followed by a Universal Resource Locator (URL) indicating where the\nWWW site is.\nAnother agent interfaces to the Jumpstation search engine on the WWW. It mimics a\nuser-request to the Jumpstation and reformats the returned result (which is a WWW page\nof links to the results) before presenting it to the user. Similarly, agents can be provided\nfor other WWW search engines, such as the WWW Worm and ALIWEB.\nOther agents can include WAIS searchers, Gopher searchers, and mailing-list handlers.\nAgents can also be designed to access interactive services such as BIDS (one of the library\ncatalogue systems). One of the drawbacks of providing agents that use the same interfaces\nas the user, rather than requiring database implementers to provide a special Application\nProgramming Interface (API), is that if the interfaces change, the agents will no longer\nwork. This could be as simple a change as a rearrangement of some menus. We will\naddress this issue somewhat in the next section.\nSince different information sources provide different search strategies (such as Boolean\nexact matches, set operations, or partial matching), some agents have to do more work\nthan just sending a query on and retrieving the results. For example, an agent that\naccesses a search engine that only accepts a single keyword, might need to submit several\nsearches for a multiple keyword query, and then combine the results, so that, as far as the\nuser or the rest of ELF is concerned, it answered the query in one fell swoop.\n72 i\nVolume 3 Number I\nThe departmental ELF\nAs outlined above, since ELF is a computer program, it can generate large amounts of\nqueries in a short space of time for long periods without rest (after all, this is why we replace\npeople with computers). It was quickly realized that if everyone used an ELF, then the\nnetworks would be flooded, and the search engines accessed by the ELF agents would\noverload. To address this, we propose a departmental level ELF. This ELF will be\nresponsible for actually doing the work. The agents of a user's ELF will submit their queries\nto the departmental level ELF> which then has the opportunity to multiplex queries across\nusers (in other words, perform duplicate queries only once). Results can be cached and used\nto answer later queries (recognizing that the results may be out of date). The departmental\nELF could also help mimic the Word of Mouth phenomenon by allowing for transferring\nof information between user ELFs. Another benefit of the departmental ELF is to provide\ncentralized management of agents, which addresses the changing interface problem alluded\nto in the previous section, by. requiring just one place to be changed.\nCurrent state and future plans\nA prototype for a single ELF is near completion. This ELF includes a database of news\narticles (dynamically changing due to new articles coming in and old ones expiring), a\nNews agent that operates over this database looking for announcements or new WWW\nsites, or just general keyword searching. Other agents include a Jumpstation agent and an\nArchie agent (Archie is an index of most FTP sites in the world). The prototype also\nincludes PrISM, and a user-monitoring agent which periodically searches the user's\ndirectory space for new or changed files, and attempts to categorize them with a few\nkeywords, using a combination of full-text analysis, typed-text analysis, and clustering\ntechniques. This ELF runs under the Unix environment running X, and is implemented in\na mixture of C++, TCL (Tool Command Language) and Perl.\nThe development of ELF will involve iterative design, with user testing at each stage. By\nemploying usability metrics, we are aiming to test groups of students, lecturers and\nresearchers using the initial prototype.\nThe development of ELF as a tool to support the process of learning in a higher-\neducation context is being conducted within an overall framework provided by the\nconcept of the Intensely Supportive Learning Environment (Sykes et al, 1993). This\nadopts a constructivist approach to learning (Kommers et al, 1992) in which the learner\nhas available a range of tools for the performance of learning tasks. The process of\nlearning through active seeking and structuring knowledge is emphasized at the expense\nof the traditional view of courseware as packaged and pre-digested exposition. An\nimportant issue raised by this is the identification of the point at which the work done by\nELF agents might become counter-productive for an individual learner.\nFinal aims of the project are to build a departmental ELF, to port the user interface to\nMS Windows, and to release the system to the UK academic community.\n73\nR.
