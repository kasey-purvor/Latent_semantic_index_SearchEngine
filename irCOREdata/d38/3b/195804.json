Introduction\n[2] The solar wind plasma outflow from the Sun carries\nthe interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) outward into the\nsolar system, where it interacts with the Earth\u2019s magnetic\nfield. Reconnection with the IMF at the outer magnetopause\nboundary of the planetary field produces open magnetic\nfield lines which map from the polar regions of the planet\ninto the solar wind. These open field lines are carried anti-\nsunward by the solar wind flow and are stretched into a long\nmagnetic tail, in which the field lines eventually reconnect\nand return to the Earth [Dungey, 1961]. The auroral sub-\nstorm cycle classically consists of a growth phase, a sub-\nstorm onset, an expansion phase and finally a recovery\nphase [Akasofu, 1964; McPherron, 1970]. During the\ngrowth phase, the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF)\ncarried by the solar wind is usually oriented southward so\nthat it efficiently reconnects with the geomagnetic field,\nproducing new open flux. This phase ends in a substorm\nonset characterized by a sudden localized brightening of the\npolar aurora near midnight, which announces the expansion\nphase during which accumulated open flux is closed by\nintense magnetic reconnection in the magnetotail [Milan et\nal., 2004, and references therein]. The system then returns\nto a quiet state during the recovery phase. In addition, solar\nbursts of fast-flowing plasma develop into interplanetary\nshocks, which interact with the magnetic environment of the\nEarth and can influence the rate of open flux closure in the\ntail. It is well known that, among other disturbances,\ninterplanetary shocks can trigger flux closure and the\ndevelopment of an expansion phase [Boudouridis et al.,\n2005, and references therein; Meurant et al., 2003; Milan et\nal., 2004]. Similar processes can occur on other planets as\nwell, and should be considered as a general mechanism\ninvolved in magnetospheric physics. Indeed, shock-induced\nopen flux closure has been suggested to be the basic cause\nof Saturn\u2019s auroral dynamics [Cowley et al., 2005].\n[3] We have developed a method that combines space-\nbased measurements of the proton aurora and ground-based\nmeasurements of the ionospheric flow to compute the global\nrates at which flux is opened and closed in the Earth\u2019s\nmagnetosphere [Hubert et al., 2006]. These rates are\nexpressed as voltages, with 1 V being equivalent to 1Wb s\u00021\nfrom Faraday\u2019s law. The images of the proton aurora are\nfrom the Spectrographic Imager at 121.8 nm (SI12) instru-\nment of the Far UltraViolet (FUV) experiment onboard the\nImager for Magnetopause to Aurora Global Exploration\n(IMAGE) satellite [Mende et al., 2000], and allow us to\nestimate the location of the boundary between open and\nclosed field lines, as well as its latitudinal motion [Hubert et\nal., 2006]. The ionospheric flow velocity~vi is measured with\nthe Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) radar\nsystem and is used to retrieve the ionospheric electric field~Ei\ngiven by ~Ei = \u0002~vi \u0003~B where ~B is the Earth\u2019s magnetic field\n[Ruohoniemi and Baker, 1998]. The electric field in the\nreference frame of the open-closed field boundary can then\nbe obtained, and integrated along the boundary to compute\nthe voltages associated with flux opening and closure\n[Blanchard et al., 2001, and references therein]. This method\nhas already been successfully applied to the study of the\nsubstorm cycle [Hubert et al., 2006]. The IMAGE-FUV\ninstrument captures an image of the planet every 2 min,\nthough the filtering process that is applied in our method to\ndenoise our results and allow time derivative computation\nreduces the time resolution to \u000112 min, thus slightly\nsmearing rapidly varying signals. In this study, we analyze\nthe time dependent flux closure directly due to the interac-\ntion of shocks and the magnetotail on the global scale, both\nfrom the observational and the theoretical standpoints.\n2. Observed Shock-Induced Reconnection\n[4] On 8 November 2000, two interplanetary shocks\nimpinged on the Earth following a several hour interval of\nGEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 33, L10105, doi:10.1029\/2006GL026008, 2006\n1Laboratory for Planetary and Atmospheric Physics, Universite\u00b4 de\nLie`ge, Lie`ge, Belgium.\n2Finnish Meteorological Institute, Space Physics Group, Helsinki,\nFinland.\n3Department of Physics & Astronomy, University of Leicester,\nLeicester, UK.\nCopyright 2006 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0094-8276\/06\/2006GL026008$05.00\nL10105 1 of 4\ndominantly northward IMF (Figure 1), such that no growth\nphase signature was expected and the amount of open flux\nin the system was rather low. The interaction of the shocks\nwith the magnetosphere disturbed its field lines on the\ndayside causing subauroral proton flashes [Hubert et al.,\n2003] at 0339 UT and 0612 UT. The solar wind plasma then\nswept by the planet and interacted with the magnetotail. The\nauroral activity triggered by these shocks did not evolve into\na substorm, as confirmed by their ground magnetic signa-\nture, which did not display the characteristic \u2018magnetic bay\u2019\nsignature. The ground based magnetometers of the Interna-\ntional Monitor for Auroral Geomagnetic Effects network all\nrecorded similar signatures, consisting of oscillations\nfollowing the shock (not shown). The AU and AL indices\n(not shown) demonstrate that substorm activity was not in\nprogress. Energetic particle observations at geosynchronous\norbit (not shown) support this conclusion. Figure 2 shows\nthe global proton aurora prior to (0337 UT) and after\n(0351 UT) the first shock hit the Earth, with the polar cap\nboundary indicated by the white line. The poleward con-\ntraction of the boundary is conspicuous, especially in the\npre- and post-midnight sectors. The simultaneous data from\nIMAGE-FUV SI12 and SuperDARN were then used to\ncompute the variations in the open flux during the interval,\nand the individual rates at which flux is opened and closed,\nwith results shown in Figure 3. A transpolar arc was\nobserved between 0400 and 0530 UT that disturbed our\nalgorithms and impaired their reliability, although the pres-\nence of a transpolar arc is not of crucial importance in this\nstudy because these structures evolve only slowly whereas\nwe are studying transient phenomena. The first shock hit the\nplanet at 03:39 UT. A few minutes later, the flux closure rate\ndramatically intensified to 132 kV, and then returned to\nundisturbed values. Overall the open flux in the system\nsignificantly decreased. The second shock impinged on the\nEarth at 06:12 UT and again caused an intensification of\nthe closure rate from\u000120 to 114 kV in the following minutes.\nThe intensification of the closure voltage of Figure 3 prior to\nthe arrival of the shock results partly from a smearing of\nrapidly varying signals by our algorithms and partly from the\nincrease of the solarwind dynamic pressure prior to the arrival\nof the shock main ramp. The shock-induced reconnection\ndetermined here is consistent with the geosynchronous mea-\nsurement of the geomagnetic field by the GOES-8 satellite,\nideally located in the midnight sector in the northern lobe at\nthe time of both shocks. The Bx component of the magneto-\nspheric field (and thus the earthward component as well)\nexhibits a marked decrease at the time of each shock arrival,\nwhile the Bz component increases. The magnetic inclination\nangle (defined as acotan (Bp\/Be) with Bp \u2013Be\u2013 the compo-\nnent of the magnetic field along the perpendicular to the\norbital plane \u2013along the satellite-Earth line, respectively\u2013)\nsharply decreases at the time of both shocks (Figure 3)\nindicating dipolarization, a well known signature of tail\nreconnection.\n[5] Both events thus share similar properties. An inter-\nplanetary shock interacted with the Earth when the open\nFigure 1.

The vertical\nlines indicate the time at which the main auroral signature is\nseen in the SI12 images, that is the development of a\ndayside subauroral proton flash, that proves the dayside\nmagnetosphere is being compressed by the solar wind\ndiscontinuity.\nFigure 2. Polar view of the proton aurora captured with\nIMAGE-FUV SI12 (expressed in image counts) prior to and\nafter that an interplanetary shock did hit the Earth at 0339 UT.\nConcentric circles are 10 degrees of geomagnetic latitude\napart. Localmidnight is at the bottom and local noon at the top\nof each image. The overlaid white curve represents the polar\ncap boundary determined from these images.\nFigure 3.

Vertical lines indicate the arrival time of the\nmain ramp of each interplanetary shock at the Earth\nmagnetopause. A transpolar arc was observed between\n0400 and 0530 UT that disturbed our algorithms and\nimpaired their reliability (dotted lines in Figures 3a\u2013c).\nL10105 HUBERT ET AL.: SHOCK-INDUCED TRANSIENT FLUX CLOSURE L10105\n2 of 4\nmagnetic flux was low: less than 0.5 GWb for the first\nevent, and less than 0.4 GWb for the second. Despite this\nfact, the flux closure voltage intensified after the shock to\nvalues similar to those of a substorm expansion phase,\nthough other expansion phase features were not observed\nin these cases. The nightside magnetic reconnection pre-\nsented here is thus clearly not related to the classical\nsubstorm cycle. Indeed, one would usually expect the pre-\nonset open flux to be significantly higher than in Figure 3,\nwith values of 0.7\u20131 GWb being reported previously, while\nthe open flux seems to reach values below 0.4 GWb only\nrather rarely [Milan et al., 2006]. The mechanism respon-\nsible for the flux closure reported here must be studied from\nanother standpoint, since it does not follow from an accu-\nmulation of large amounts of open flux in the magnetotail,\nbut is driven more directly by the interaction of the\ninterplanetary shocks with the magnetosphere, which are\ncapable of compressing the magnetotail as they sweep by it.\n[6] The phenomenon of transient flux closure induced by\nan IP shock does of course not exclude reconnection inherent\nwith the substorm cycle. A major IP shock has been observed\non 18 April 2001, that impinged on the Earth at \u00010047 UT\nwhen the open flux was \u00010.89 GWb as determined using\nSI12 images. A dramatic transient flux closure resulted from\nthe interaction of the shock and the magnetosphere, reaching\n\u0001340 kV (a value much larger than those usually met at\nsubstorm onset) shortly after the shock had reached the\ndayside magnetopause and had triggered a subauroral proton\nflash. The activity that followed the transient closure, con-\nsidering the AU and AL indices as well as the computed\nclosure voltage, points to the substorm expansion and\nrecovery phases (not shown). We can thus speculate that\nthe compression of the tail by the IP shock triggered a direct\nflux closure and a substorm expansion at the same time.\n3. MHD Simulation\n[7] A theoretical simulation was undertaken with\nthe magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) Grand Unified\nMagnetosphere-Ionosphere Coupling Simulat ion\n(GUMICS-4) model [Janhunen, 2000] in order to analyze\nthe mechanism responsible for the flux closure. This model\nsolves the equations of ideal MHD for the coupled solar\nwind \u2013 magnetosphere system, and is coupled to an iono-\nspheric simulation. Like any ideal MHD model, GUMICS-4\ndoes not include any explicit modelling of the reconnection\nmicrophysics, nor does it reproduce the loading-unloading\ncycle [Laitinen et al., 2005]. However, the model is able to\ndescribe the plasma flow and magnetic field topology in the\nsurroundings of a neutral line that develops in the tail.\nIndeed, in a first approximation, classical MHD remains\nvalid in the diffusion region surrounding the reconnection\nsite [Kivelson and Russel, 1997], although Hall MHD is\nimportant as well in the immediate vicinity of a (substorm-\nrelated) reconnection line [Nagai et al., 2003, and references\nthere in]. The neutral line appears in the simulation as a\nconsequence of numerical diffusion that mimics resistive\nprocesses when the magnetic topology is close to the x-line\nstructure. No reconnection voltage can be consistently com-\nputed from the simulation because the computed electric\nfield remains null or perpendicular to the merging line in\nideal MHD. However, it is possible to compute the recon-\nnection power, that is, the amount of magnetic energy that is\nconverted into thermal and kinetic energy by reconnection at\nthe x-line, by integrating the divergence of the Poynting\nvector over a volume that contains the neutral line [Laitinen\net al., 2005]. We focus on the structure of the MHD flow in\norder to identify the manner in which it could influence a\nrealistic reconnection neutral line in the tail.\n[8] The simulation that we conducted represents the\ninteraction of an interplanetary shock with the magneto-\nsphere under northward IMF Bz conditions. The magnitude\nof the x-component of the magnetic field in the tail lobe and\nthe computed reconnection power are shown in Figure 4,\ntogether with the solar wind dynamic pressure used as\nmodel input. The simulation conventionally starts at\n00:00 UT. The model is first run with steady inputs until\nit reaches a steady state around 01:30 UT. The solar wind\ndensity is suddenly increased around 02:10 UT, simulating\nthe arrival of an interplanetary shock. The increased density\ncompresses the magnetosphere, causing the geomagnetic Bx\nfield component to intensify. As the geomagnetic field is\nmostly parallel to the x direction in the tail lobe, such an\nincrease in Bx implies an increase of the magnetic field\nmagnitude. The computed nightside reconnection power\nexhibits an increase by a factor \u00017 after the shock hits\nthe magnetosphere. Figure 5 presents the computed plasma\ndensity and shows how the shock drapes around the\nmagnetopause compressing it. The lobe magnetic field\nsignature seen in the simulation (increase of Bx (Figure 4)\npositive deflection of By and negative deflection of Bz in the\nnorth lobe) is known to be typical of lobe compression\n[Huttunen et al., 2005]. The compression of the magnetotail\nextends all the way down to the equatorial plane, causing an\nincrease of the plasma density in the near Earth plasma\nsheet (Figure 5). The magnetic Bx disturbance only vanishes\nafter the solar wind pressure is decreased, indicating that the\nmagnetic field lines are \u2018\u2018piled up\u2019\u2019 in the tail by the lobe\ncompression. This shows that the simulated plasma flow\nand geomagnetic topology, and hence the way the x-line\nregion is fed with magnetic field to be reconnected, are\nstrongly influenced by the solar wind pressure exerted on\nthe magnetospheric tail. Detailed inspection of the MHD\nFigure 4. (a) Solar wind dynamic pressure used as input of\nthe MHD simulation.

Indeed, a disturbance\nof a boundary layer can result in the crossing of a critical\nlimit of stability leading to the formation of a neutral line\ntopology [Birn et al., 2003].\n4. Summary\n[9] The direct capability of solar wind disturbances to\ndrive near-tail magnetic reconnection, and the dependence\nof the tail energy state on the ability of near-tail reconnec-\ntion to drive a substorm are important elements in under-\nstanding the solar wind \u2013 magnetosphere coupling. We\nhave demonstrated that the observed intensification of the\nflux closure rate under the effect of interplanetary shocks is\ndirectly driven by the compression of the tail lobes that\nmoves the flowing plasma and field lines toward the plasma\nsheet, feeding the reconnection site with fresh magnetic\nflux. This produces reconnection voltages larger than\n110 kV, comparable with values found shortly after sub-\nstorm onsets, despite the pre-existing open flux content\nbeing so small during these events that effects related to\nthe loading-unloading substorm cycle are not expected.\n[10] Acknowledgments.
