Most grain is harvested, dried and then stored on farm or in silos for medium\/long term storage. Cereal quality is influenced by a range of interacting abiotic and biotic factors. In the so-called stored grain ecosystem, factors include grain and contaminant mould respiration, insect pests, rodents and the key environmental factors of temperature, water availability and intergranular gas composition, and preservatives which are added to conserve moist grain for animal feed. Thus knowledge of the key critical control points during harvesting, drying and storage stages in the cereal production chain are essential in developing effective prevention strategies post-harvest. Studies show that very small amounts of dry matter loss due to mould activity can be tolerated. With < 0.5% dry matter loss visible moulding, mycotoxin contamination and downgrading of lots can occur. The key mycotoxigenic moulds in partially dried grain are Penicillium verrucosum (ochratoxin) in damp cool climates of Northern Europe, and Aspergillus flavus (aflatoxins), A. ochraceus (ochratoxin) and some Fusarium species (fumonisins, trichothecenes) on temperate and tropical cereals. Studies on the ecology of these species has resulted in modelling of germination, growth and mycotoxin minima and prediction of fungal contamination levels which may lead to mycotoxin contamination above the tolerable legislative limits (e.g. for ochratoxin). The effect of modified atmospheres and fumigation with sulphur dioxide and ammonia have been attempted to try and control mould spoilage in storage. Elevated CO2 of > 75% are required to ensure that growth of mycotoxigenic moulds does not occur in partially dried grain. Sometimes, preservatives based on aliphatic acids have been used to prevent spoilage and mycotoxin contamination of stored commodities, especially feed.

INTRODUCTION\nMicroorganisms are ubiquitous in terrestrial ecosystems from which they are disseminated to\ncontaminate plant communities. The ripening seed is no exception and is contaminated by a wide\nrange of bacteria, yeasts and filamentous fungi via the air, insects, rain splash, equipment and\nagronomic practices. Thus, depending on climatic conditions at harvest, grain carries a wide\nrange of microbial contaminants. Post-harvest treatment of such grain and the prevailing\nenvironmental factors are key determinants of the impact fungi may have on the grain quality\nincluding germinability. It is important to remember that harvested grain and contaminating\nmicroorganisms are alive and respiring slowly under dry, safe storage conditions.\nPoor post-harvest management can lead to rapid deterioration in nutritional quality of\nseeds. Microbial activity can cause undesirable effects in grains including discoloration,\ncontribute to heating and losses in dry matter through the utilization of carbohydrates as energy\nsources, degrade lipids and proteins or alter their digestibility, produce volatile metabolites\ngiving off-odours, cause loss of germination and baking and malting quality; affect use as animal\nfeed or as seed. Filamentous fungal spoilage organisms may also produce mycotoxins that can be\ncarcinogenic or cause feed refusal and emesis (Magan et al., 2004). The spores of some fungi\ncause respiratory disease hazards to exposed workers (Lacey and Crook, 1988).\nEstimated losses of grain, especially staple food grains in store, from all causes varies\nwidely. They may amount to 10% worldwide (Anon, 1979) but can reach 50% in tropical regions\n(Hall 1970). Vasan (1980) estimated losses of high moisture rice in southern India to be about\n15-25% in only 9 days, while Rohani et al. (1985) found storage losses of paddy in West\nMalaysia of only 1%. Spoilage of stored grain by fungi is determined by a range of factors\nwhich can be classified into four main groups including (a) intrinsic nutritional factors, (b)\n5extrinsic factors (c) processing factors and (d) implicit microbial factors (Sinha, 1995). Figure 1\nsummarises the factors which affect fungal colonization of stored grain.\nWallace and Sinha (1981) in the 1970s were the first to consider stored grain as a man-\nmade ecosystem which needed to be examined in a more holistic, ecological manner to enable a\nproper understanding of the processes occurring and to improve post-harvest management of\nstored food commodities of all types. This approach has enabled prevention strategies to be\ndeveloped and implemented to avoid microbial and pest infestation from damaging stored grain-\nbased commodities. Since most cereals are stored dry, bacteria seldom cause spoilage. At\nintermediate moisture content levels fungal spoilage and pests are of major concern. The\ndevelopment of prevention strategies today has been predominantly based on using the HACCP\napproach and to identify the critical control points in the pre- and post-harvest food chain. This\nhas been examined for some food chains (e.g. Fusarium and trichothecenes) in temperate cereals\n(Aldred and Magan, 2004) and the HACCP approach to mycotoxin control has been reviewed by\nAldred et al. (2004. This review will examine some important mycotoxins and the post-harvest\ncontrol strategies which have been developed for effective management to minimize entry of\nmycotoxins into the food chain. In some cases, pre-harvest decisions can significantly impact the\ncapability for subsequent post-harvest control.\n2. RESPIRATION AND DRY MATTER LOSSES\nGrain itself and the microbial contaminants respire slowly when stored dry. However, if the\nwater availability is increased to 15-19% moisture content (=0.75-0.85 water activity (aw),\nwheat) spoilage fungi, particularly Eurotium spp., Aspergillus and Penicillium species grow,\nresulting in a significant increase in respiratory activity. This can result in an increase in\ntemperature and sometimes spontaneous heating from the colonisation by a succession of fungi\n6resulting in colonisation by thermophilic fungi and actinomycetes (Fleurat-Lessard, 2002; Magan\net al., 2004). The chemical process involved in heat generation is predominantly aerobic\noxidation of carbohydrates such as starch. The energy is released by the following equation:\nC6H12 O6+ 6 O2 --> 6 CO2 + 6 H2O+ 2835 kJ\nHeating occurs when this energy is released faster than it can escape from the cereal substrate.\nThe requirement for oxygen increases with temperature, to a maximum of 40oC, but does not\ndecrease greatly until the temperature exceeds 65oC. At this temperature, microbial growth is\nlargely inhibited and heating results from exothermic chemical oxidation. Thus the respiratory\nquotient (RQ) may be 0.7 to 0.9 up to 65oC but <0.5 at higher temperatures.\nBy utilizing the RQ, CO2 production can be translated into dry matter loss. Typically,\ncomplete respiration of carbohydrates gives a RQ, i.e. ratio of O2 consumed to CO2 produced of\nabout 1.0, and it has been calculated that 14.7 g C02 kg-1 grain will be released for every 1% loss\nof grain dry matter. During anaerobic fermentation, only about 0.493 g CO2 is evolved from a kg\nof grain for every 1% dry matter loss. Alternatively, a RQ <1.0 may result from lipid or protein\nmetabolism. For example, tripalmitim has a quotient of 0.7. The greater the CO2 production, the\nshorter the safe storage period without dry matter loss. Studies by Jonsson et al. (2000) utilised\nrespiratory rates over a wide range of aw levels and temperatures to examine development of\nmoulds such as P.verrucosum in stored grain and effects on germinability, fungal biomass and\nmaximum safe storage times. They suggested that the maximum storage time without mould\ngrowth was probably halved if moisture content at harvest was increased by 1-3% (=0.05 aw) or\nif storage temperature was increased by 5oC in temperate cereals. Fleurat-Lessard (2002) in his\ncomprehensive review suggested that for the modelling and prediction of global quality changes\nthe rate of CO2 production can be used as a \"storability risk factor\".\n7The ratio of contribution of spoilage moulds and grain to total respiration has been argued\nfor many years. A range of studies have demonstrated that grain spoilage and by implication dry\nmatter loss is predominantly determined by fungal activity. Wheat quality loss has been\nmeasured and models developed based on germination rates, visible mould growth or respiration\nof grain and microorganisms (Fleurat-Lessard 2002). Kreyger (1972) found that storage of\nbarley at 24% water content (=0.94 aw) at 16oC for 10 weeks lost 2% dry matter with visible\nmoulding. Studies with maize showed that fungal invasion and aflatoxin content could be\nunacceptable before the grain had lost 0.5% dry matter and mould became visible (Seitz et al.,\n1982). White et al. (1982) noted that 0.1% was unacceptable for first grade wheat and proposed\nan absolute level of 0.04%. However, when 55 days safe storage was predicted for grain stored at\n18.4% mc (=0.86 aw) visible moulding occurred after 23 days storage.\nStudies have been carried out to compare the dry matter losses caused by individual\nmycotoxigenic fungi and the effect of a naturally contaminated mixed fungal community. Using\ngamma irradiated wheat grain (12kGy) which had no fungal contamination, but had retained\ngermination capability, studies were carried out by inoculation with mycotoxigenic fungi such as\nPenicillium verucosum and Aspergillus ochraceus. Figure 2 shows that this is influenced by\nwater availability. Quantification of dry matter losses based on respiration rates and gas\nchromatography to measure CO2 production is a useful tool to measure this. Based on these\nexperiments, a maximum dry matter loss by these individual species was in the range of 5-7%\n(Ibupoto and Magan, Cranfield University, unpublished data). However, studies with naturally\ncontaminated cereal grain suggested that depending on aw and temperature, much lower dry\nmatter losses can result in visible moulding. Table 1 shows data for wheat which was obtained\nby Hamer et al. (1991). It is important to note that visible mould was observed when only 0.2-\n0.4% dry matter loss had occurred. For maize, similar studies suggested that a loss of 0.5% dry\n8matter due to fungal spoilage would result in rejection of grain for human consumption and\naflatoxin contamination.\nThere are problems with the use of visible moulding as a criterion of deterioration\n(Hamer et al., 1991; Lacey et al., 1997). A number of studies have found this to be a subjective\nindex of the safe storability of grain (Hamer et al., 1991; Magan et al., 2004). Magan (1993)\nsuggested that microscopic growth may be a more effective measurement of initial colonisation\nthan visible moulding. Some attempts have also been made to relate dry matter losses to actual\ncalorific losses due to the activity of mycotoxigenic moulds. These have been recently reviewed\n(Magan et al., 2004).\n3. PREVENTION OF OCHRATOXIN A (OTA) CONTAMINATION\nRecent surveys of cereals in Europe, especially of wheat and barley, have shown that, of OTA\nproducing fungi, P.verrucosum is predominantly isolated with only the occasional presence of\nA.ochraceus, especially in the Mediterranean basin. Thus contamination with OTA has been\nidentified as predominantly a post-harvest problem in Europe. Lund and Frisvad (2003)\ndemonstrated that P.verrucosum grain contamination occurred during the harvesting process and,\ncritically, during drying and storage. Thus, during damp harvest years in Northern Europe it is\nessential that effective drying regimes are employed post-harvest. Poor drying can result in\nP.verrucosum colonisation occurring, and potential for pockets of mycotoxin contaminated grain\nto be present in silos. Thus effective management of this phase is critical to try and prevent OTA\ncontamination at this post-harvest stage in the food chain. Species such as P.verrucosum and\nA.ochraceus are very competitive and able to dominate under conducive environmental\nconditions in stored grain in temperate and tropical regions, respectively (Magan et al., 2003).\nSome recent work has suggested that the level of contamination by P.verrucosum may be a good\n9indicator of potential contamination with OTA (Lund and Frisvad, 2003; Lindblad et al., 2004).\nFor example, Lund and Frisvad (2003) found that samples with >7% contamination of wheat\ngrain with P.verrucosum indicated OTA contamination, although no linear correlation between\nthe two factors was obtained.\nThe most important abiotic factors which influence growth and OTA production by such\nspoilage fungi include water availability, temperature, and when grain is moist, gas composition\n(Magan et al., 2004). The interaction between these variables primarily determine whether mould\ngrowth will occur and if so the relative development of the fungal community. An accurate\ndetermination of the marginal conditions for growth and OTA production by species such as\nP.verrucosum and A.ochraceus is important as it can be used to provide guidelines of the level of\nrisk of contamination of the grain through the food chain. However, this requires detailed\ninformation on the ability of isolates of these species to colonise grain matrices over a range of\ninteracting conditions.\nRecent studies by Cairns-Fuller (2004) and Cairns-Fuller et al. (2005) have shown the\ngeneral relationship between water availability (water activity, aw), temperature, growth and\nOTA production for P.verrucosum and A.ochraceus. For example, rapid growth occurs at 0.98-\n0.99 aw (= >27-30% m.c.) over the temperature range 10-25oC and is almost completely inhibited\nat about 0.80-0.83 aw (=17.5-18% m.c.). No OTA was produced at 0.80 aw, although some was\nproduced at 0.85 (=19%) at 15 and 20oC. Optimum conditions were at 0.93-0.98 aw (23.5-27.5%)\nat 10-25oC on wheat grain incubated for up to 56 days. The temporal production of OTA by\nstrains of P.verrucosum showed that on wheat grain between 7-14 days was required for\nsignificant OTA to be produced at levels above the EU tolerable limit (Cairns-Fuller et al.,\n2005). Contour maps of the optimum and marginal conditions of water and temperature for\ngrowth and OTA production have been constructed (Cairns-Fuller et al., 2005). This study\n10\nshowed that approx. 17-18% moisture content (ca. 0.80-0.83 aw) is the limit for any potential\ngrowth or OTA production in wheat grain. Thus, it is essential that grain is dried to lower\nmoisture content as quickly as possible regardless of the drying system employed. To avoid\ninitiation of moulding by xerophilic Eurotium species, drying to <14.5% m.c. (=0.70 aw; Magan\net al. 2004) is essential. This has to be maintained during storage and transport to effectively\nprevent contamination with OTA.\nRecently, Lindblad et al. (2004) developed a logistical model to relate populations of\nP.verrucosum (CFUs) to probability of exceeding the European legislative limit of 5 \u00b5g kg-1 in\ncereal grain under different aw x temperature storage regimes. They suggested a threshold of\n1000 CFU of P.verrucosum g-1 grain as a threshold limit for the probability of risk from\ncontamination with OTA at above the legislative limit. They found that P.verrucosum\npopulations increased at 0.80 aw, based on spore production (serial dilution counts) but without\nforming OTA. However, spore production may not always be an accurate measure of fungal\ngrowth, but gives an indication of sporulation capacity. Previously, Frisvad and Samson (1991)\nestimated that the threshold for growth and OTA production by P.verrucosum would be approx.\nat 0.81-0.83 aw and 0.83-0.90 aw, respectively. The modelling of Lindblad et al. (2004) and those\nof Cairns-Fuller et al. (2005) suggest that growth can certainly occur under some conditions at\n0.80 aw, although OTA production may be limited to about 0.83 aw. Thus the so-called \u201czone of\nuncertainty\u201d which exists for OTA contamination is between 15-17.5% moisture content which\nis critical in determining whether a high risk from OTA can occur.\nKey post-harvest critical control points which are important include:\n1. Regular and accurate moisture measurement determinations\n11\n2. Efficient and prompt drying of wet cereal grain. This will be directly related to the buffer\nstorage time and temperature prior to drying as well as the actual drying conditions (e.g.\nambient, heated air drying) to target safe moisture contents. Wheat\/Barley\/Oats, 14-\n14.5%; Maize, 14%; Rice, 13-14%; Canola (rape seed) 7-8%.\n3. Infrastructure for quick response, including provision for segregation and appropriate\ntransportation conditions\n4. Appropriate storage conditions at all stages in terms of moisture and temperature control,\nthe general maintenance and effective hygiene of storage facilities for prevention of pests\nand water ingress\n5. Ability to efficiently identify and reject material below specified standards in terms of\nboth fungal contamination and, at some stages, mycotoxin levels (e.g. when passing to a\nthird party)\n6. Operation of approved supplier systems. This requires the setting of specifications for\nacceptance\/rejection\n4. PREVENTION OF MYCOTOXINS IN MAIZE\nHarvesting of maize is often carried out at moisture contents which are >14-15% which requires\ndrying to reduce the available water to <0.70 aw (=14%) which is safe for storage. Often\nharvested maize is left at drying facilities during this critical part of the chain if drying facilities\nare working at full capacity. This can create problems with an opportunity for growth and\nmycotoxin contamination of maize, especially by Fusarium section Liseola (fumonisins by\nF.verticilioides, F.proliferatum), F.graminearum (trichothecenes; zearalenone), and Aspergillus\nflavus (aflatoxins). The ecology and physiology of germination, growth and fumonisin\nproduction on maize has been described in detail recently (Marin et al., 2004; Desjardins, 2006).\n12\nThe role of mycotoxin production in competitiveness of these moulds has been considered by\nMagan and Aldred (2007).\nFor maize, the pre-harvest selection of hybrids, time of planting, plant density and insect\ncontrol have all be found to have an impact on contamination of maize with these mycotoxins\npre-harvest and during drying and storage. For example, late maturing hybrids (600-700 FAO\nclasses) had ZEA and DON levels 3-4 times higher than early maturing hybrids (400-500 FAO\nclasses). Interestingly, fumonisins were significantly correlated with other genetic traits such as\nkernel specific weight or starch composition. Pre-harvest sowing time also has an impact on\nlater contamination with fumonisins. For example, late sowing times in Europe (e.g. May), were\nfound to have 4 x higher fumonisins than earlier sowing times. A key critical control point\nappears to be the harvesting time. In late maturing hybrids there was an increase in fumonisins\nand zearalenone produced by different Fusarium species (Fusarium section Liseola;\nF.graminearum). This was found to be less significant in medium-early hybrids (Blandino et al.,\n2004; Reyneri, 2006).\nStudies of moist maize of different moisture contents have also pointed to the importance\nof moisture content and efficiency of drying regimes required to control fumonisins and\nzearalenone contamination. For example, moist maize (25% m.c.) kept for 7 days after\nharvesting, and prior to drying, resulted in a siginificant increase in fumonisins (77%) and an\neven greater accumulation of zearalenone (Blandino et al., 2004). Overall, pre-harvest factors\nare critical for effective post-harvest prevention of fumonisins from contaminated maize entering\nthe post-harvest phase of the food chain. The key factors are:\nPre-harvest\n1. Proper selection of maize hybrids; prevent use of soft kernel hybrids\n2. No late sowing dates (in Europe, in May) and avoid high cropping density\n13\n3. Good balanced fertilization\n4. Avoid late harvesting\n5. Effective control of pests such as European corn borer\nPost-harvest\n1. Minimize times between harvesting and drying\n2. Effective cleaning of maize prior to storage\n3. Efficient drying to <14% m.c.\n4. Effective hygiene and management of silos\n5. Absence of pests in store which can provide metabolic water and initiate heating\n6. Clear specifications and traceability from field to store\n5. MODIFIED ATMOSPHERES FOR MYCOTOXIN PREVENTION IN STORED\nGRAIN\nFor many years modified atmospheres or alternative gases have been examined for the medium\nand long term storage of cereal grain destined for food\/feed. While fungi involved in\nbiodeterioration of grain are considered to be obligate aerobes, many are actually micro-\naerophilic, being able to survive and grow in niches where other species cannot grow and thus\ndominate specialised grain ecosystems. In many cases decreasing O2 to < O.14% is required\nbefore growth can be substantially reduced. Increasing CO2 to > 50% is required for inhibition of\nmycelial growth (Magan and Lacey 1984). Some species, e.g. P.roqueforti, are able to grow and\ninfect grain at > 80% C02 provided at least 4% 02 is present. The use of integrated post-harvest\nsystems for prevention of deterioration entails modifying O2 and CO2 simultaneously and the use\nof (O2 free) N2. The tolerance to low O2 and high CO2 is also influenced by interactions with\ngrain type and water availability. The drier the grain, the more effective the treatment. Modified\n14\natmosphere storage is used for control of both moulds and insects in moist stored grain. Regimes\nsufficient for moulds may not however be effective against some storage insects, which can\nsurvive and grow over a wider equilibrium relative humidity range.\nModified atmosphere storage has been examined for the storage of moist grain, especially\nfor animal feed. Studies with P.verrucosum and A.ochraceus with up to 50% CO2 suggest that\nspore germination is not markedly affected, although germ tube extension and hence colonisation\nis significantly inhibited by 50-75% CO2, especially at 0.90-0.995 aw for both P.verrucosum and\nA.ochraceus (Cairns-Fuller, 2004; Cairns-Fuller et al., 2005). Growth and OTA production were\nhighest in air, followed by 25 and 50% CO2 regardless of the aw level tested on wheat grain\n(Figure 3). Generally, CO2 and aw together cause an enhanced inhibitory effect, although this was\nnot synergistic.\nMore comprehensive studies have been carried out on mycotoxigenic Aspergillus and\nFusarium species. For example, Paster et al. (1983) reported that OTA production by\nA.ochraceus was completely inhibited by >30% CO2 on agar-based media after 14 days\nsuggesting that there are differences between mycotoxigenic species. This suggests that for\nefficient storage of moist cereals >50% CO2 concentrations needs to be achieved rapidly to\nprevent OTA contamination in storage or during transport.\nWork with Fusarium sporotrichioides showed that T-2 toxin production could be reduced\nby 80% with 50% CO2\/20% O2, but growth was not affected by <60% CO2 in vitro (Paster et al.,\n1986; Paster and Menasherov, 1988). Contaminated maize stored at 26oC for 14 days at 22%\nmoisture content in 60% CO2\/20% O2 reduced T-2 production completely, with 40% CO2\/5% O2\ntreatment resulting in only trace amounts. Production of zearalenone by Fusarium equiseti was\nalmost completely inhibited by >20%CO2 with either 20 or 5% O2 in grain (Paster et al., 1991).\nSamapundo et al. (2007) found that fumonisin production by Fusarium section Liseola species on\n15\nmaize was inhibited by 30% CO2 over a range of aw levels although sealed systems were used in\nwhich final CO2 concentrations were much greater.\nDiener and Davis (1977) made a systematic study of CO2 and O2 and how these gases\naffected aflatoxin production in maize. When O2 concentration was decreased from 21 to 15 %\nthere was no effect on aflatoxin production and a marked inhibition occurred only when the O2\nconcentration was decreased < 5%. Moreover, aflatoxin production was decreased by 25% when\nthe CO2 elevated to 20% although it had no visible effect on growth and sporulation. These\nresults are different from those with P.verrucosum and OTA production where 25% CO2 reduced\ngrowth but resulted in a limited reduction in OTA accumulation. All these studies suggest that\nmycotoxigenic fungi have different responses to exposure to CO2 in relation to growth and toxin\nproduction and factors such as water activity, temperature, nutrients and times of exposure all\nneed to be considered in establishing effective control regimes.\n5.1 Sulphur dioxide gas for post-harvest control\nSulphur dioxide (SO2) is one of the oldest food additives and it has a long history as a\ndisinfectant by the burning of elemental sulphur and the use of the resultant fumes. After the\ndevelopment of inorganic chemistry SO2 and its salts became commonly used as preservatives,\nparticularly of food and beverages (Magan, 1993). It is commonly used as a fungal inhibitory\ntreatment of grapes and sometimes raisins. For example, it is used for table grape storage in order\nto prevent growth of Botrytis cinerea. It is also used in the process of wine making and it is a\nnecessity for the storage and preservation of white wines. During processing, golden raisins are\noften treated with S02 in order to prevent the enzymatic browning and additionally act as an\nantimicrobial to prevent growth of moulds, yeasts and bacteria. While SO2 fumigation has been\n16\nexamined for medium term storage of cereals, from an engineering point of view there are\nproblems with corrosion especially of pipework used for delivery of the SO2 to the grain stores.\nSO2 can be highly toxic to micro-organisms as it has mutagenic effects, and thus\ninactivates mRNA and reacts with disulphide linkages in proteins, enzyme cofactors, aldehyde\nand ketone structures of five and six carbon sugars; it deaminates cytosine derivatives to uracil\ncompound, and it has deleterious effects on the membrane (Babich and Stotzky, 1980). In\ncontrast, small quantities of SO2 may stimulate growth as the sulphur is an essential element for\nthe growth. Raghunathan et al. (1969) found that treatment of 13% moisture content sorghum\nwith sodium metabisulphite (64mg L-1, 48 hrs at 25oC) inhibited 95% of internal grain fungi, but\nalso significantly reduced germinability. Treatment of moist maize (24% m.c.) with 0.3% SO2\nresulted in a significant decrease in microbial colonisation and practically no deleterious effect\non grain quality (Eckhoff et al., 1979). Further studies by Eckhoff et al. (1983) of moist maize\n(26.5%) with 0.066% SO2 alone or combined with 0.018% NH3 showed that after 60 mould-free\ndays, Penicillium spp. were found to have colonised the to third of the bin. It has been suggested\nthat for medium term storage of 5 months at least 4.4% SO2 g kg-1 was required for effective\npreservation (Katangaza, 1990). However, some studies have suggested that much higher\nconcentrations may be required because of adsorption and binding of the SO2 to the wheat grain,\nreducing the antifungal activity. Both Maleque (1989) and Serre (1991) showed that depending\non the wheat m.c. between 20-30% gaseous SO2 became bound to the grain during treatment.\nThus, intermediate moisture contents of grain (15-19%) may be more effectively treated than\nmoist grain (>20%) as less of the treatment will become bound to the substrate.\nThere is very little detailed information on the actual tolerance and sensitivity of\nmycotoxigenic fungi to SO2. Previously, Magan (1993) examined the effect of different\nconcentration of SO2 in relation to different temperatures (15, 25oC) and aw levels in vitro and in\n17\nsitu on grain for control of Penicillium and Aspergillus spp. The growth of Aspergillus species\n(Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus ochraceus, Aspergillus terreus) was inhibited by 50 mg L-1\ndissolved SO2 on a malt extract-based medium at 0.995 and 0.95 aw. Some Penicillium species\nand Aspergillus niger were tolerant of up to 250 mg L-1. In contrast, growth of Penicillium spp.\nwas stimulated by 100 mg L-1. Moreover, phyllosphere fungi such as Cladosporium herbarum\nand Epicoccum nigrum were tolerant of up to 200 mg L-1 while Aureobasidium pullulans and\nBotrytis cinerea were inhibited by this level. Overall, at 0.96 and 0.92 aw up to 2000 mg L-1 was\nneeded to obtain a 1-2 log decrease in populations of spoilage fungi on cereal grain.\nFurthermore, Majumber et al. (1973) reported the inhibition of both fungal growth and\nmycotoxin production. However, no studies have examined the effect of SO2 alone or\ninteractions with water activity on germination, germ tube extension and OTA production on\ncereals.\nThe difference in sensitivity between spoilage moulds could be due to the fact that\nseveral factors influence the efficacy of SO2. The tolerance of Penicillium species to high\nconcentrations of SO2 has been suggested to be due to their ability to actively transport the SO2\ninto the mycelia (Tweedie and Segal, 1970). Furthermore, King et al. (1981) showed that SO2-\nbinding substances enabled yeasts to be tolerant to higher concentration of SO2.\nFurthermore, the relationship between the concentration of available SO2 and effects on\nfungi is influenced by formulation of the product and critically by pH. The solubility products of\nSO2 in water vary with the different pH level (Babich and Stotzky, 1974). The significant point is\nthat the toxicity of these products also differs, with greatest efficacy of the undissociated\nsulphurous acid (H2SO3) > bisulphite (HSO3-) > sulphite (SO3-2). The presence of SO2 mainly in\nthe bisulphite form, can have moderate toxicity of the solubility products. Recent studies with\nstrains of A. carbonarius and OTA production suggested that the Effective Dose (ED)90 values of\n18\nsodium metabisulphite (mg L-1) used for generating the SO2 for OTA control were about 650-\n700 at 0.985 aw, 400-500 at 0.965 aw and 400-450 at 0.93 aw (Pateraki et al., 2005; Pateraki et al.,\n2006).\n6. POST-HARVEST CONTROL USING PRESERVATIVES\nMoist grain specifically destined for animal feed is often treated with aliphatic acid-based\npreservatives. There are a number of commercial products predominantly based on salts of\npropionic and sorbic acids. However, these are fungistats and thus the coverage of the grain must\nbe efficient to prevent under-treated pockets. Poor coverage can lead to growth of spoilage fungi,\nespecially mycotoxigenic moulds which can sometime metabolise these aliphatic acids. Studies\nby Marin et al. (1998, 2000) showed that growth of Fusarium section Liseola species and\nfumonisin production was relatively unaffected by different mixtures of proprionic and sorbic\nacids. There is thus interest in finding alternative compounds to either enhance or to replace such\ncompounds. Research has been carried out on both essential oils and anti-oxidants (Cairns and\nMagan, 2003; Hope et al., 2003; Fanelli et al., 2003; Hope et al., 2005). These studies have\nsuggested that only a few essential oils such as cinnamon and clove leaf oil have the capacity for\ncontrol of mycotoxigenic Fusarium species, P.verrucosum, A.ochraceus and DON and OTA\nproduction depending on environmental conditions. However, there are many economic and\ntechnological hurdles associated with this type of approach. In tests on wheat grain,\nbutylhydroxyanisole (BHA), propyl paraben (PP), cinnamon oil and resveratrol gave greater than\n90% reduction in DON and NIV accumulation. Resveratrol has been demonstrated to have a\nparticularly wide spectrum of mycotoxin control, although at present this is a relatively\nexpensive product (Fanelli et al., 2003). Table 2 shows example of the ED50 for growth\ninhibition and OTA inhibition of P.verrucosum and A.ochraceus on wheat grain under different\n19\nenvironmental conditions. At present this type of product may be uneconomical. However,\nshould costs decrease then it may become a viable alternative to existing preservation systems\nfor animal feed grain.\n7. Processing for minimising entry of mycotoxins into the food\/feed chain\nThere have been studies to examine the fate of mycotoxins if they do enter the food chain. It is\nimportant to have useful information on the relative partitioning of different mycotoxins in\nfractions of cereals when they are milled and used for different purposes, including human and\nanimal consumption. Detailed studies have been carried out on the milling of wheat grain for\nbread and for extrusion purposes using grain contaminated at 10 and 50 initial ppb of OTA. Guy\net al. (2004) showed that brown bread after cleaning and scouring contained about 40-50% of the\nOTA regardless of starting contamination level. The rest was predominantly in the bran\nfractions. In white bread production OTA was mainly found in the white flour and bread (20-\n30%). Again, bran contained the largest fraction of the OTA, especially when the initial\ncontamination level was 50 ppb. Overall, the bran and offal flours which are important by-\nproducts that enter the food chains contain the highest OTA fractions.\nLess information is available on deoxynivalenol. It is stable in many processes and a high\npH and temperature are required for breakdown in maize. However, up to 50% survives dough\nfermentation and some can enter the brewing process where maize is used.\nWith regard to zearalenone, 60% has been found to survive in bread and 50% in noodles.\nThe decrease during extrusion of maize grits was related to temperature as was found with DON\nDry milling of maize can reduce levels by 80-90% in flour and grits but gives higher levels in the\nbran and germ. Wet milling leads to concentration in the gluten fraction. It can be metabolised by\nyeasts to produce \u03b2-zearalenol in beer and occasionally zearalenols have been found in milk\n20\nFor aflatoxins, by flotation it is possible to separate contaminated maize grain. However,\nuse of maize flour results in 50% surviving in bread. There is some redistribution during milling,\nand some carry over can occur in beer. Recent studies have been carried out on dry milling\nfractions. Table 3 shows an example of such data in relation to fumonisins, zearalenone and\nDON in maize (Blandino et al., 2004). This clearly shows the significant amounts of these\nmycotoxins which can enter the feed chain when dry milling is the technique used. This could\nhave significant implications for effective development of prevention strategies, especially in\nrelation to CCPs in the feed chain. More focus is needed in this area of research.\n8. CONCLUSIONS\nPrevention strategies post-harvest can only be effective for mycotoxins that are formed during\nthis component of the food chain. Pre-harvest natural contamination can only be minimized post-\nharvest by application of processing techniques which will minimize subsequent entry into the\nfood and feed chain where possible. There are however key management tools and traceability\nprocedures which should be used to facilitate stored commodities to be effectively conserved\nwith minimum loss in quality. These include accurate and regular moisture measurements to\nensure safe thresholds are not breached. Efficient and prompt drying of wet cereals for medium\nand long term storage in hygienic silos free of insect pests and mouldy material. Traceability\nduring silo storage and transport for processing. It is essential that Good Agricultural Practice\nand operation approved supplier chains are in place. This also required effective diagnostic tools\nwhich can be used to monitor and quantify mycotoxins rapidly (Magan, 2006). Representative\nsampling remains a problem for stored commodities. While legislation exists on sampling\nprocedures, these are not easy to achieve and the errors in actually taking samples may be\nsignificant compared to those for actually analysing for the mycotoxin contamination level. Early\n21\nindication of changes in stored commodities due to insect or mould activity may be possible by\nmonitoring of intergranular gas composition and the use of volatile fingerprints. The\ndevelopment of models on mycotoxigenic mould activity and the conditions which will prevent\nmycotoxin production and which can give an indication of tolerances relevant to the legislative\nlimits are important. Combined data will enable us to realize the goal of developing realistic and\naccurate decision support systems for effective conservation of grain post-harvest. In the coming\nyears we will need to build on the existing sound foundations in developing strategies for the\nprevention of spoiled grain and mycotoxins entering the human and animal food chains.\n9.
