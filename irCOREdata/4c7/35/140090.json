In order to characterise the effect of projectiles it is necessary to understand the mechanism \nof both penetration and resultant wounding in biological systems.  Porcine gelatin is commonly used as \na tissue simulant in ballistic tests because it elastically deforms in a similar manner to muscular tissue.  \nBullet impacts typically occur in the 350-850 m\/s range; thus knowledge of the high strain-rate \ndynamic properties of both the projectile and target materials are desirable to simulate wounds.

The \nHugoniot for a 20 wt.% porcine gelatin, which exhibits a ballistic response similar to that of human \ntissues at room temperature, was determined using the plate-impact technique at impact velocities of \n75-860 m\/s.  This resulted in impact stresses around three times higher than investigated elsewhere.  In \nUS-uP space the Hugoniot had the form US = 1.57 + 1.77uP, while in P-uP space it was essentially \nhydrodynamic.

Gelatin \nprovides a method of suspending water in a solid, \ncastable form.  The resultant similarity in ballistic \nresponse to muscular tissue has led to the use of \nporcine gelatin dissolved at 20 wt.% in water as a \nflesh penetration simulant.  While much previous \nwork on this material has involved validation \nagainst low velocity penetration data [1,2], \nsurprisingly little high strain-rate data beyond a \nlimited US-uP Hugoniot [3] exists in the literature.  \nIn this paper a novel \u201ccup\u201d system is used to allow \nplate-impact experiments on as-cast 20 wt.% \ngelatin targets, establishing a US-uP equation-of-\nstate in order to inform comparison of the simulant \nand actual tissue materials at high strain rates.  This \nmaterial equation-of-state provides useful \ninformation to aid the development of future \nhydrocode models to simulate tissue damage. \nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE \n \nMaterial properties \n \nA 250 bloom porcine gelatin (Weishardt \nInternational, France) mixed in water to 20 wt.% at \nc.60 \u00baC, and subsequently allowed to set at room \ntemperature, was employed in all tests.  Density \nwas measured to be slightly greater than water at \n1.06 \u00b1 0.01 g\/cm3.  Sound speeds were measured \nultrasonically using a Panametrics 5077PR pulse \nreceiver in the pulse-echo configuration combined \nwith appropriate Panametrics 1.0 MHz transducers.  \nA longitudinal sound speed (cL) of 1.48 \u00b1 0.06 \nmm\/\u00b5s was established, in good agreement with cL \nfor water (1.49 mm\/\u00b5s [4]).  During plate-impact \nexperiments gelatin acts hydrodynamically \u2013 i.e. as \na fluid.  It possesses negligible stiffness and is \ntherefore unable to support a shear wave [4]. \n \nPlate-impact experiments \n \nPlate-impact experiments [5-7] at 75-860 m\/s \nwere conducted using a \u220550-mm bore single-stage \ngas gun [8].  Target material was cast into level cup \ncontainers, with a base comprising a c.1 mm thick \ncover plate of the same material as the flyer plate.  \nCareful measurement of the final as-cast thickness \n(3-10 mm) was made.  Longitudinal manganin \ngauges (type LM-SS-125CH-048, manufactured by \nVishay Micro-Measurements\u00ae & SR-4\u00ae and \ncalibrated according to [6]) were encapsulated \nwithin 25\/50-\u00b5m thick mylar layers as required and \nintroduced either side of the target to monitor \nshock propagation.  Shock velocity was \nsubsequently determined based on the spatial \nseparation of the two gauges.  The rear surface \ngauge was backed by a 12-mm thick PMMA block, \nsized to allow mounting within the cup where the \ndepth of gelatin was insufficient to reach the cup \nrim.  The rear surface gauge package was adhered \nto the back face of the as-cast gelatin using a \ncompatible fast-setting epoxy, before being bonded \nto the structural elements of the cup to enhance \ntarget package rigidity.  All other elements of the \ntarget package were bonded using slow curing \nLoctite 0151 HYSOL\u00ae Epoxi-Patch\u00ae Adhesive.  \nGauge analysis was performed according to the \nimpedance matching technique [5-7].  A typical \nexperimental setup is shown in Fig. 1.  Impact \nvelocities were measured by shorting a series of \nspatially separated velocity pins, while the target \npackage was mounted on a target ring, itself \nmounted on a sacrificial barrel extension. \n \nSealed gun\/barrel\nsection Velocity pin\nblock\nBarrel\nGauge assemblies\nTarget ring\nCover plate\nCup containing gelatin\nPMMA\nSabot Flyer plate\nTrigger pins  \nFigure 1. Plate-impact experimental setup. \n \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \nNine shots using either PMMA, Dural or Cu \nflyers were undertaken according to the \nconfiguration shown in Fig. 1.  Experimental \nresults are summarised in Table 1.  In one case \nfront gauge failure prevented a US-uP point from \nbeing determined and, in another, insufficient \nconfidence in the measured Hugoniot stress led to \nits exclusion from the results.  Typical front and \nrear unfiltered gauge traces are presented for a 604 \nm\/s shot in Fig. 2.  The rear surface trace has been \nrescaled to represent the approximate stress in the \ngelatin target based on the known Hugoniot of \nPMMA according to [7], \n \nTABLE 1.

Front\/rear gauges traces generated following \nimpact of a 10-mm thick Cu flyer at 604 m\/s onto a 4.6 \nmm thick gelatin target following Fig. 1. \n \nBoth traces in Fig. 2 showed a rapid rise (b) to \na Hugoniot stress (d) followed by a reloading (e) \nand subsequent elastic release (f) before gauge \nfailure (g).  An initial undershoot on the front \nsurface gauge just before shot arrival at (a) has \nbeen linked elsewhere [9] to an increase in \ncapacitance between the gauge and cover plate as \nthe cover plate is accelerated towards the gauge.  \nGauge rise times (b) were relatively slow compared \nto a typical longitudinal gauge response [7] at 144 \nand 170 ns on the front and rear gauges \nrespectively.  This was due to the difficulty of \nensuring an intimate contact with the as-cast \ngelatin.  Nevertheless, these rise times were \ncomparable and sufficiently sharp to indicate a \ngood impedance match between the manganin \ngauges and their encapsulation.  Further, rise \ndurations were small compared to the temporal \nshock lifetime.  Following the rise on the front \nsurface gauge, ringing within the gauge \nencapsulation just before the Hugoniot plateau \nresulted in an overshoot above the Hugoniot stress \n(c).  Good correlation between the constant \nHugoniot stress values on both gauges (d) followed \nreduction of the rear surface data using Equation \n(1).  A consequent difference in stress magnitude \nof <5% between the two plateaus confirmed the \nvalidity of the stress measurements.  Finally, \nreloading above the original Hugoniot stress on \nboth gauges at (e) is due to shock reverberation \n[10,11] \u2013 i.e. ringing between the higher \nimpedance Cu cover and PMMA backing which \nencapsulated the lower impedance target gelatin. \nUS-uP and P-uP Hugoniot relationships based \non Table 1 are presented in Figs. 3 and 4 \nrespectively.  Errors were calculated in different \nways.  For US and uP they were based on the range \nof possible shock arrival times (\u2206t in Fig. 2) and \nwere typically < 0.4 and 0.01 mm\/\u00b5s respectively.  \nFor \u03c3X, the errors represented variations across the \nmeasured Hugoniot plateaus and were consistently \n< 0.1 GPa.  For comparison, the limited available \nliterature data on 20 wt.% gelatin is also included \nin Fig. 3 [3]. \n \nUS = 1.57 + 1.77uP\nUS = 1.45 + 1.99uP\n0\n1\n2\n3\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\nU\nS\n(m\nm\n\/\u00b5\ns)\nuP (mm\/\u00b5s)\nK.

P-uP Hugoniot, 20 wt.% gelatin. \n \nThe US-uP Hugoniot in Fig. 3 is in good \nagreement with the two available data points for 20 \nwt.% gelatin from Nagayama et al. [3].  Further, \nwithin the error bars the experimental Hugoniot for \n20 wt.% gelatin and that for water from [3] are \nextremely similar.  This implies that gelatin \nbehaves entirely hydrodynamically under shock \nloading.  Unlike strong materials where US-axis \nintercept normally occurs at the bulk sound speed \n[5], with gelatin, the intercept occurs at a similar \nvelocity to the longitudinal sound speed (e.g. 1.45 \nmm\/\u00b5s, compared to a measured cL of 1.48 \u00b1 0.06 \nmm\/\u00b5s).  Fig. 4 includes a theoretical curve, based \non the US-uP Hugoniot set out in Fig. 3, which \npredicts the behaviour of the gelatin assuming that \nit behaves hydrodynamically [9].  Good agreement \nis observed between the experimental data and the \nhydrodynamic response. \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n \nA novel technique which allows 1D plate-\nimpact experiments to be carried out on gel-based \nmaterials has been successfully implemented using \n20 wt.% porcine gelatin.  US-uP and P-uP Hugoniot \nrelationships have been established for this \nmaterial.  Good agreement between the measured \nUS-uP relationship and the limited literature data \navailable enhanced confidence in the technique.  \nThe importance of this result was emphasised by \nthe fact that the type of gelatin employed is well \ndefined, whereas the source of the material \ndescribed in the literature is unclear.  Comparison \nof the measured Hugoniot to that for water as well \nas ultrasonic measurements of elastic properties \nindicated that under high strain rates the as-cast \ngelatin behaves hydrodynamically (e.g. it exhibits \nno significant shear strength).  \nOverall, the equations-of-state set out in this \npaper greatly enhance the availability of materials \ndata for hydrocode models designed to compare the \nresponse of ballistic penetration simulants with \nactual biological tissues.  When combined with a \nknowledge of ballistic tests (to allow calibration of \nstrength elements of material models), this data \nshould minimise the requirement for testing on \nbiological tissues. \n \n \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n \nThe authors wish to thank both Gary Cooper \nfor experimental support and ARUP for provision \nof both funding and support. \n \nREFERENCES \n1.
