Positioning data of nodes can be used in wireless\nnetwork deployments to improve dynamic routing or to\nallow location-stamping of sensor data. By additionally\ntracking users, location systems also enable a diverse range\nof context-aware applications, allowing devices to more\neffectively serve the people using them.\nThe Global Positioning System (GPS) allows mobile\nreceiver units to compute their position by measuring radio\nsignal times-of-arrival from satellites [1]. Typical accuracies\nare within a few meters, but GPS performance is seriously\nhampered indoors. To address this shortcoming, a number\nof dedicated indoor location systems have been developed.\nAll involve gathering data by sensing a real-world physical\nquantity and using it to calculate or infer a position estimate.\nSome of the earliest systems rely upon periodic infrared\nlight pulses sent between transmitter and receiver units [2],\n[3], [4]. The infrared signal uniquely identifies the transmit-\nting unit and, using the known location of the fixed units in\nthe system, the position of mobile units can be estimated\nwith room-scale granularity. More recently, location sys-\ntems based upon radio signals have been introduced. Some\nutilize visibility or signal strength measurements of wireless\nLAN access points [5], while others rely upon specialized\ntags and infrastructure to perform radio signal time-of-flight\nmeasurements [6]. Both types of systems have typical\naccuracies of three meters or more.\nIn contrast, fine-grained location systems are capable of\nsupplying positioning information with centimeter-level\naccuracy, which can be used to enhance existing applications\nas well as enable new ones. A number of fine-grained\nlocation-aware applications exist for workplace, home, and\npublic spaces. Examples include moving maps, mobile\ndesktop control, follow-me teleconferencing andmultimedia\nstreaming, activity annotation, ubiquitous user interfaces,\naugmented reality, indoor environmental control, phone call\nforwarding, monitoring and support systems for the elderly,\nand museum tour guides.\nUltrasonic location systems have proven to be a\nrelatively simple, effective solution for fine-grained indoor\npositioning. However, existing ultrasonic location systems\nfor mobile computing all utilize narrowband ultrasound,\nforcing compromises in a number of aspects of system\nperformance.\nThis paper explores the use of broadband ultrasound as\nthe basis for fine-grained location sensing. First, previous\nfine-grained ultrasonic location systems are reviewed and\ntheir common limitations identified. Broadband ultrasonic\ntransmitter and receiver units appropriate for use in\nprototype indoor positioning systems are then described\nand characterized. A suitable spread spectrum signaling\nmethod is outlined and its capacity for ranging is evaluated.\nThis paper then reports experimental results taken using a\npolled, centralized location system and a privacy-oriented\nlocation system. Theperformance analysis of the two systems\nallows general conclusions to be drawn about the benefits of\nbroadband ultrasonic location systems.\n2 RELATED WORK AND MOTIVATION\nA variety of fine-grained indoor location sensing solutions\nexist for mobile computing. In the HiBall system, user-worn\nlateral effect photo diodes sense arrays of flashing infrared\nLEDs mounted in the ceiling [7]. Ultra-wideband radio\nlocation systems developed by Ubisense Ltd. utilize\nreceivers deployed in a building to track users carrying\nsmall tags which emit ultra-wideband signals [8]. The TRIP\nsystem employs computer vision techniques to track\n2D circular bar code tags on users and devices [9].\nAlthough highly effective, fine-grained infrared and\nultra-wideband systems employ specialized hardware and\n536 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MOBILE COMPUTING, VOL. 5, NO. 5, MAY 2006\n.

Computer vision-based approaches which\nuse commodity cameras are potentially lower cost, but they\nhave yet to be deployed on large scales. Thus, their true cost\nhas not been assessed and their ability to perform wide-area\ntracking of many people and devices in everyday environ-\nments has not been confirmed.\nA number of other research efforts have been directed\ntoward ultrasonic location systems. Ultrasonic transducers\nare relatively inexpensive, and their signals typically have\nlower processing requirements than the solutions men-\ntioned above, resulting in simple, lower-cost systems which\nhave proven to be effective for wide-area fine-grained\npositioning indoors.\n2.1 Ultrasonic Location Systems\nIn the Bat system [10], users wear small badges which emit\nan ultrasonic pulse when radio-triggered by a central\ncontroller. The system determines pulse times-of-flight from\nthe badges to a network of receivers on the ceiling and\ncalculates the 3D positions of the badges using a multi-\nlateration algorithm. The system yields location information\nwith an accuracy of approximately 3 cm and an aggregate\nlocation update rate of 150 Hz is theoretically possible.\nThe Cricket system [11] employs beacons distributed\nthroughout a building which each send an RF signal\ndescribing the surrounding space while simultaneously\nsending an ultrasonic pulse. The beacons broadcast at\nrandom times in order to minimize signal collisions.\nDevices called listeners, carried by mobile users, receive\nthe RF and ultrasonic signals and calculate their approx-\nimate distance from the beacon using time-of-flight meth-\nods. The first implementation of the system could localize\nusers to within an area of about one square meter, but by\nusing a greater density of beacons, the authors were able to\nachieve between 5 and 25 cm accuracy [12]. Since 25 distance\nsamples were gathered from each beacon to minimize the\neffects of reflections and ultrasonic noise, a single location\nupdate would take an average of over 5 seconds to produce.\nThe listeners can independently locate themselves, avoiding\nthe potential compromises of user privacy involved with\ncentralized systems.\nSimilarly, Randell and Muller describe a system [13]\nwhich allows wearable and mobile computers to autono-\nmously compute their position. Four ultrasonic transducers\nare placed at the corners of a square on the ceiling and are\nwired to a controller. The controller sends a radio trigger\nand then issues an ultrasonic pulse from each of the\nfour transducers in succession. A mobile receiver unit,\nsynchronized by the radio trigger, measures the ultrasonic\npulse times-of-flight from which it estimates its location\nwith 3D accuracies between 10 and 25 cm. The update rate\nof the system is several hertz.\n2.2 Limitations of Narrowband Ultrasonic Location\nSystems\nThe above three systems all utilize narrowband ultrasonic\ntransducers for their ranging measurements. Three inherent\nlimitations arise because of this:\n1. Single-user access. If multiple colocated transmit-\nters send signals at the same time, the signals can\ninterfere with one another, corrupting reception.\n2. Lack of identification encoding. Narrowband sys-\ntems characteristically have slow data rates, which\nmake it nearly impossible to encode a unique\nidentifier in the short-duration ranging signal; thus,\nit is difficult for a receiver to distinguish between the\nsignals from different tags.1\n3. Noise sensitivity. The systems exhibit poor perfor-\nmance in the presence of ultrasonic noise.\nThe ultrasonic location systems described above avoid\nthe first problem by attempting to ensure that colocated\ntransmitters send their signals one-at-a-time. This solution\ncomes at the expense of a slower update rate; allowing only\none transmitter to send at a time constrains the number of\nlocation updates possible for a given time interval.\nThe second problem is often addressed by using a wider\nbandwidth technology, such as radio or infrared, to indicate\nthe identification of a transmitting unit. However, provid-\ning a dedicated communications channel for this purpose\nincreases system complexity, requires more static infra-\nstructure, and raises the power consumption of the mobile\ndevices.\nThe third problem has not been addressed. Ultrasonic\nnoise is created through peoples\u2019 everyday actions. Exam-\nples include the clink of a pencil dropping onto a desk, the\nclacking of someone typing on a computer keyboard, or the\nrustling of a bag of potato chips being opened. These\nsounds occur frequently in typical indoor environments.\nFor the duration of such an occurrence, the above ultrasonic\nlocation systems are prohibited from generating accurate,\nup-to-date position estimates for mobile units colocated\nwith the noise source.\nIt is proposed that broadband transducers and spread\nspectrum signaling techniques be used to overcome these\nlimitations. The aim of the research presented in this paper\nis to identify and characterize the practical benefits of\nbroadband ultrasound for indoor location systems.\n3 DEVICE DESCRIPTION AND CHARACTERIZATION\nPrototype broadband ultrasonic transmitters and receivers,\ncollectively referred to as Dolphin units, have been devel-\noped. This section describes the design and characterization\nof the Dolphin prototypes. It is shown that channel\nbandwidth, as well as the transmitter and receiver angular\nsensitivity patterns, justify the use of the Dolphin proto-\ntypes for exploration of the capabilities of broadband\nultrasonic location systems.\nIt should be noted that the Dolphin units were designed\nto facilitate flexibility, in order to fully gauge the potential of\nthe new technology. Thus, the devices have not been\noptimized for size or power consumption, and signal\nanalysis and generation are performed externally. How-\never, optimizing the designs to make the units small, self-\ncontained, wireless, and battery-powered is feasible, and\nthe modifications needed in order to accomplish this are set\nout in Section 5, alongside the discussion of Dolphin\nlocation system implementations.\nHAZAS AND HOPPER: BROADBAND ULTRASONIC LOCATION SYSTEMS FOR IMPROVED INDOOR POSITIONING 537\n1. Although the Bat system, which uses a differential-phase modulation\ntechnique, allows up to three tags to transmit simultaneously [10], it still\ncannot uniquely identify tags from their ultrasonic ranging signals alone.\n3.1 Transducer Selection and Mounting\nThe narrowband transducers typically used in ultrasonic\nlocation systems rely on piezoelectric ceramics as their\nsensing elements. These kinds of transducers are inexpen-\nsive, small, rugged, and have a high sensitivity. However,\nthey are highly resonant and, in most cases, have a usable\nbandwidth of less than 5 kHz.\nElectrostatic transducers, on the other hand, possess high\nsensitivity and extremely wide bandwidth. However, they\nare not very rugged and are expensive, making their\ndeployment on a large scale prohibitive.\nCertain synthetic polymer films have piezoelectric\nproperties [14] and are known as piezopolymer films or\nsimply piezo films. These piezo films, most notably poly-\nvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), have been applied as ultrasonic\ntransducers in hydrophone applications, and for high\nfrequency (greater than 200 kHz) medical imaging and\nnondestructive testing [15], [16], [17], [18]. Piezo film\ntransducers are small, inexpensive, more rugged than\nelectrostatic transducers, and have a wide frequency\nbandwidth.\nAlthough there are off-the-shelf piezo film devices\navailable which have appropriate bandwidth characteristics\nfor ultrasonic location, these packages tend to be too bulky\nfor application in mobile computing scenarios. Thus, it was\nnecessary to create a piezo film transducer which is small\nand unobtrusive, but still has a bandwidth and radiation\npattern appropriate for indoor location systems.\nA piezo film ultrasonic transducer for air ranging has\nbeen designed by Fiorillo [19], [20] and further character-\nized by Wang and Toda [21] and Toda and Tosima [22]. It\nconsists of a small, rectangular piece of piezo film mounted\nalong two of its edges to form a half-cylinder. As depicted\nin Fig. 1, the design works by virtue of the fact that the ends\nof the piezo film are firmly clamped. Any change in the\nradius r of the hemicylinder can be seen as a change in the\nlength l of the piezo film, since l \u00bc \u0002r. Due to the\npiezoelectric properties of the film, changes in l are\napproximately proportional to the voltage across the\nthickness of the film. Thus, the clamped piezopolymer can\nfunction in two ways:\n1. as a transmitter, when voltages are applied to it, and\n2. as a receiver, when airborne acoustic waves impact it.\nThis transducer was designed to measure short distances\nand has a maximum range of 40 cm.\nA modified version of Fiorillo\u2019s design is used in the\nDolphin prototype transmitters and receivers. Sheets of\npiezo film were procured from Measurement Specialties,\nInc.2 Small transducer elements were cut from the piezo\nfilm sheets. As shown in Fig. 2, each element was placed\nbetween exposed conductive pads on two pieces of printed\ncircuit board (PCB). Using a screw and bolt adjacent to each\nof the pads, the two pieces of PCB are held tightly together,\nrigidly clamping the ends of the piezo film element. The\npiezo film elements fitted on the transmitter units have a\ncylindrical length of approximately 5 mm, while those on\nthe receiver units are 10 mm, to allow greater sensitivity.\n3.2 Transmitter\nCompared to more common ultrasonic transducers, such\nas piezoceramics, piezo film transducers have low\nefficiency. For flexibility during experiments, it was\ndesired that the transmitter unit be capable of driving\nits piezo film transducer with signal levels ranging from\ntens to hundreds of volts peak-to-peak. As shown in\nFig. 3, this was accomplished by using a power op amp\nwith some signal conditioning and a step-up transformer.\nA Dolphin transmitter unit is shown in Fig. 4, and\nmeasures 60 mm\u0002 94 mm\u0002 15 mm. Five of the transmitter\nunits were characterized using measurements taken in an\nanechoic chamber.\nThe measured frequency responses of the five units are\nshown in Fig. 5a. There is little difference in the responses of\nthe individual transmitters. Fig. 5b shows the averaged\nfrequency response for the five units.\nThe radiation pattern was characterized by measuring\nthe sound pressure level at various angles in two different\nplanes, defined in Fig. 6. The averaged response at 50 kHz\nof five transmitters for a range of these angles is shown in\nFig. 7.\nOverall, the characteristics of the Dolphin transmitters\nare favorable. At one meter, the acoustic output does not\nvary by more than 10 dB for frequencies from 35 to 100 kHz\nand for angles of \u0003 and \u0004 within 60 degrees.\n3.3 Receiver\nThe relatively low piezoelectric efficiency of piezo films\nagain dictated design decisions for the receiver prototype.\nAn electrometer in a charge amplifier configuration was\nused to amplify the low-level signal produced by the piezo\nfilm element, as shown in Fig. 8. Because of the sensitivity\nof the electrometer preamplifier stage, it was necessary to\nelectromagnetically shield the receiver circuitry (Fig. 9).\nOtherwise, radiation from outside sources, such as the high\nvoltages which are possible at the transmitter, can create\nunacceptable signal-to-noise ratio conditions.\nThe sensitivity characteristics of five Dolphin receivers\nwere measured in an anechoic chamber. At one meter,\nthe receiver units possessed an average sensitivity of\n1,724 mV\/Pa at 50 kHz. Fig. 10a shows their responses in\n538 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MOBILE COMPUTING, VOL. 5, NO. 5, MAY 2006\nFig. 1. Operation of a clamped cylindrical piezopolymer transducer [20].\n2. The polymer film was 28 mm thick, and both sides of the sheets had\nbeen electroded with a thin layer of vacuum-deposited copper-nickel metal\nalloy.\ndecibels, referenced to this sensitivity, while Fig. 10b\nshows the averaged frequency response.\nFig. 11 displays the 50 kHz sensitivity within the \u0003 and\n\u0004 planes (defined in Fig. 6), averaged for the five receivers.\nThe plotted sensitivities are expressed in decibels, refer-\nenced to the sensitivity at zero degrees.\nThe behavior of the receivers is not as close to the ideal as\nthat of the transmitters. The frequency response varies by\n25 dB across the inspected frequency range. The authors\nsuspect that the receiver frequency characteristic may be\nadversely affected by the metal mesh shielding, or possibly\nthe electrometer preamplifier circuit, but further character-\nization of the receiver would be necessary to determine the\ncause.\nWith regard to beam pattern, receiver sensitivity is\nwithin 10 dB for j\u0003j \u0003 60\u0004 and significant sidelobes are\nvisible at \u0003 \u00bc \u000545\u0004. Note that the \u0004 beam pattern is within\n10 dB for angles between \u000560\u0004 for the transmitters, but only\n\u000545\u0004 for the receivers. Longer cylindrical lengths tend to\nfocus the beam pattern more [23]. Since the length of the\nreceiving transducers is twice that of the emitting transdu-\ncers, this more concentrated beam is expected.\n3.4 Channel Bandwidth\nThe average frequency response of the channel between a\nDolphin transmitter and receiver is shown in Fig. 12. For\non-axis ranging at a distance of one meter, the channel has\n76 kHz of bandwidth above the noise floor. As shown by\nTable 1, if the signal is attenuated by off-axis transmission\nor greater distances between the transmitter and receiver,\nthere still remains significant bandwidth above the noise\nfloor.\n4 BROADBAND RANGING\nWith thewide bandwidth characteristic of the Dolphin units,\nspread spectrum signaling can be employed to achieve a\nprocessing gain, allowing ranging to be accomplished at a\nvariety of angles of incidence and room-scale distances. This\nsectiondiscusses a signalingmethodappropriate for distance\nmeasurement with broadband ultrasound and presents the\nranging accuracy of the method. A signal processing\ntechnique to enhance themultiuser capabilities of themethod\nis then outlined.\n4.1 Direct Sequence, Code Division Multiple Access\nIn a direct sequence (DS) spread spectrum system, a data-\nmodulated carrier signal is further modulated by a\npseudorandom binary sequence [24]. The rate at which\nthe pseudorandom sequence is applied is usually much\nfaster than the data rate. This has the effect of spreading the\nspectrum of the signal. One can think of this as distributing\nthe information content (i.e., data) over a large range of\nfrequencies instead of centering it closely about the carrier\nfrequency. Spreading the spectrum in this way makes the\nsignal more robust in the presence of in-band noise. Using\nDS pseudorandom spreading methods for ranging in a\nbroadband ultrasonic location system would avoid the\nnoise sensitivity limitation of existing narrowband systems.\nGold codes are a particular set of pseudorandom\nsequences which have desirable auto and cross-correlation\nproperties [25]. If different Gold codes are assigned to users\nin a spread spectrum system, their signals can be sent\nsimultaneously and still be separated at the receiver. This\ngives the system multiple-access properties since corruption\ndue to signal collision is minimal. A system which uses\nHAZAS AND HOPPER: BROADBAND ULTRASONIC LOCATION SYSTEMS FOR IMPROVED INDOOR POSITIONING 539\nFig. 3. Transmitter block diagram.

In this prototype, power and analog signal\ngeneration are provided by external sources.\ncodes specially selected to achieve separation of over-\nlapping signals from different users is described as code\ndivision multiple access (CDMA). Employing CDMA meth-\nods for broadband ultrasonic ranging addresses the single-\nuser and identification coding constraints associated with\nnarrowband systems.\nDS\/CDMA signal structures are appropriate for the\nDolphin channel because they make high processing gains\nto counter low signal-to-noise conditions more easily\nattainable than other multiple-access methods, such as\nfrequency hopping. The ranging messages used in the\nexperiments presented in this paper consist of a 50 kHz\ncarrier wave, modulated by a Gold code using binary\nphase-shift keying. The Gold code has a length of 511 bits\nand is applied at a rate of 20 kHz, yielding a ranging\nmessage duration of about 25 ms. Fig. 13 shows the\nfrequency spreading effect when such a Gold code is used\nto modulate the carrier.\nIn order to detect the arrival of a ranging pulse, the\nreceiver must correlate the received waveform against a\nversion of the signal which is locally generated, using the\nknown signaling parameters. A simple peak detection\nalgorithm can then be used on the correlation result to\nidentify the ranging signal time-of-arrival.\n4.2 Ranging Accuracy\nDS\/CDMA signals have proven to be successful for ranging\nin previous systems. They are employed in GPS ranging\nsignals [1] and Girod and Estrin have used codes with\nsimilar properties in their acoustic ranging system, which\noperates in the audio frequency range [26].\nTo verify the ultrasonic ranging accuracy of DS\/CDMA\nspreading using Gold codes, tests were run using a Dolphin\n540 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MOBILE COMPUTING, VOL. 5, NO. 5, MAY 2006\nFig. 5.

The speed of ultrasound in air\n(needed to convert a measured time-of-flight to a distance)\nwas estimated with the aid of a temperature sensor. One\nthousand five hundred ranging measurements were per-\nformed at each of five distances between 0.5 and 2.5 m. The\nranging error is shown in Fig. 14. Variation of the\nmeasurement error with distance is on the order of several\nmillimeters\u2014no more than one might expect from the\nuncertainty of the hand-measured reference distances used\nto compute the errors.\n4.3 Successive Interference Cancellation\nCDMA systems in which many transmitters are sending\nsimultaneously sometimes suffer from the problem of\ninterference between signals, in spite of the fact that the\ncodes chosen might have near-orthogonal properties. This\nhappens when some transmitters have a large signal power\nat the receiver compared to other transmitters. When trying\nto demodulate a signal which is many times weaker than\nother signals present, the cross-correlation peaks due to\nthose other signals can become significant, and the detector\nHAZAS AND HOPPER: BROADBAND ULTRASONIC LOCATION SYSTEMS FOR IMPROVED INDOOR POSITIONING 541\nFig. 8.

(b) \u0004 sensitivity.\nmay be unable to resolve the weak signal. The situation in\nwhich one transmitter with a comparatively large signal\npower causes a degradation in system performance is\ndescribed as the near-far effect.\nOne way of dealing with multiuser interference in\nCDMA systems is to employ successive interference cancella-\ntion (SIC), proposed by Viterbi [24]. A receiver performing\nSIC first attempts to detect all of the transmitters from\nwhich it might expect to see a signal. Once this is done, one\ntransmitter is chosen (which presumably has a large signal\npower relative to the others), and that transmitter\u2019s signal is\nreconstructed at the receiver and subtracted from the\nreceived waveform. The process is repeated until there is\nonly one user remaining.\nThe difficulty in performing SIC lies in accurately\nestimating the amplitude of the signal to be canceled. In\nradio communications, signal amplitude determination is\naided by explicit knowledge of the relative user powers,\nthrough the use of transmitter power control [27]. However,\nin an indoor ultrasonic location system with mobile users\nand devices, the transmitter signal power at the receiver is\ndependent on the transmitter\u2019s location and orientation and\nis not directly known. Alternative methods allow the signal\namplitude to be estimated from the correlation [28]. A\nsimilar strategy can be used for SIC processing of broad-\nband ultrasonic ranging signals and is applied in one of the\nlocation systems described in the next section.\n5 TWO BROADBAND ULTRASONIC LOCATION\nSYSTEMS\nThis section reviews two prototype broadband ultrasonic\nlocation systems which employ Dolphin units. The systems\nhave fundamentally different architectures and, taken\ntogether, illustrate the advantages provided by broadband\nultrasound. Comments are then given on the hardwaremod-\nifications needed to make the Dolphin prototypes appro-\npriate for wide-area deployments and use by mobile users.\n5.1 Polled, Centralized Location System\nSome ultrasonic location systems are polled, meaning that\ntransmitters are told when to send their ranging messages,\nwhereas others are centralized, indicating that there is a\ncentral service which collects the time-of-flight data and\nuses it to estimate the locations of mobile tags. The Bat is an\nexample of a polled, centralized location system. Since the\ntransmitters are centrally coordinated, such systems tend to\nhave superior update rates compared to other architectures.\nThe Dolphin prototypes were used to implement a polled,\ncentralized location in a small office [29]. Eight receivers\nwere affixed to the ceiling, and their positions accurately\nsurveyed. Four transmitters were placed at fixed positions in\nthe room, about 0.75 m above the floor. An additional\ntransmitter, the mobile unit, was placed at 64 test locations\nwithin the small office. The test points covered a variety of\nheights (10 to 140 cm above the floor) and included locations\nin close proximity to walls and hard furnishings, which tend\nto cause ultrasonic reflections. A temperature sensor was\nplaced in the room, in order to allow accurate estimation of\nthe speed of sound in the air. As with the distance accuracy\nmeasurements presented above, all signal generation,\ncapture, and analysis was performed on a workstation PC.\n542 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MOBILE COMPUTING, VOL. 5, NO. 5, MAY 2006\nFig. 12. Average ultrasonic channel bandwidth. Measurements were\ntaken at a distance of one meter, with the transmitting and receiving\ntransducers directly incident.\nTABLE 1\nEffect of Signal Attenuation on Above-Noise Bandwidth\nFig. 13. Spreading the spectrum of the ranging message. (a) 50 kHz\ncarrier only. (b) 50 kHz carrier spread by 20 kHz Gold code.\nFig. 14. Transmitter-to-receiver ranging error. The error bars indicate the\nstandard deviation of the measurements at each distance.\n5.1.1 Location Estimation\nThe location of the mobile unit was estimated using the\nfollowing steps:\n1. The times-of-flight of the mobile unit\u2019s ranging\nmessages were measured by correlating the recei-\nvers\u2019 signals against the expected signal (a 50 kHz\ncarrier modulated by the mobile unit\u2019s Gold code).\nThe time-of-flight was defined as the time between\nthe triggering of the transmitter and the occurrence\nof a large peak in the correlated data.\n2. The times-of-flight were converted to transmitter-to-\nreceiver distances using the speed of sound in air.\n3. Using the accurately surveyed positions of the\nreceivers and the transmitter-to-receiver distances,\nlocation was estimated by employing the multi-\nlateration algorithm described by Ward et al. [30].\nSince the receivers are coplanar, a minimum of three dis-\ntances is needed to estimate the mobile unit\u2019s position, with\nthe assumption that it is below the ceiling. However, it was\nrequired that at least four distances be measured, enabling\nthe multilateration algorithm to estimate the errors of its\nproduced locations. The algorithm does not return a position\nestimate if there are fewer than four transmitter-to-receiver\ndistances or if the distances have a high error estimate.\n5.1.2 Results\nFive hundred location readings were taken at each of the\n64 test points for four test cases:\n1. the mobile unit transmitting by itself,\n2. the mobile unit and the four fixed units transmitting\nsimultaneously,\n3. the mobile unit and the four fixed units transmitting\nsimultaneously in the presence of noise (i.e., jingling\nkeys),3 and\n4. the mobile unit and the four fixed units transmitting\nsimultaneously, with SIC processing applied.\nFig. 15 shows the error distribution functions of the\nreturned locations for the mobile unit in the four test cases.\nTable 2 indicates the percentage of readings for which the\nalgorithm returned a location estimate. The 95 percent\nconfidence levels of the 3D position accuracies are also listed.\n5.1.3 Advantages\nThe results clearly show that the broadband system performs\nrobustly in the presence of noise which would have caused\ntypical narrowband ultrasonic location systems to fail to\nreturn location estimates. Although the location algorithm\nreturned fewer readings in thepresence of noise, the accuracy\nof the location updates was not significantly affected.\nIt is also demonstrated that the system has a capacity for\nincreased aggregate update rates since multiple transmitters\ncan emit ranging their signals simultaneously and be\nsuccessfully detected at the receivers. With the signaling\nparameters chosen, the maximum update rate for a single\ntransmitter is about 40 Hz. However, given the Gold code\nlength, up to 513 transmitters could simultaneously emit\nnear-orthogonal ranging signals, yielding a maximum\ntheoretical aggregate update rate of about 20 kHz. Although,\nin current scenarios, it is doubtful that this upper limit is\neasily achievable or even necessary, it does demonstrate that\nbroadband systems can produce location updates many\ntimes faster than narrowband solutions. In the above results,\nthe multiuser test case produces about 20 percent fewer\nlocation readings than the single user case, but this can be\nalleviated by employing SIC processing.\nThe last important conclusion is that the system can\nproduce near-simultaneous location updates for different trans-\nmitters. Because of the multiple-access nature of the system,\nlatency between the location updates for different transmit-\nters is minimal. Thus, such a system would have superior\nperformance for applications which require near-simulta-\nneous updates for different objects. Examples include\n3D mice, gesture recognition, augmented and virtual\nreality, and the simultaneous tracking of moving people\nand the devices they carry.\n5.2 Privacy-Oriented Location System\nSomeresearchhasbeendirected towardmore privacy-oriented\nsolutions to location sensing.4 Ultrasonic location systems\nHAZAS AND HOPPER: BROADBAND ULTRASONIC LOCATION SYSTEMS FOR IMPROVED INDOOR POSITIONING 543\nFig. 15. Accuracy of location estimates in the polled, centralized system.\nTABLE 2\nPolled, Centralized Location System Performance\n3. This type of noise has been known to make narrowband ultrasonic\nlocation systems fail to report location estimates altogether.\n4. It remains to be seen whether such systems provide benefits for the\nuser in practice\u2014denying location information to external devices severely\nlimits the applications which can be made available, and complications\narise when trying to reliably authenticate and distribute location informa-\ntion without being compromised by an attacker.\nwhich are meant to allow complete security and control for\nthe privacy-conscious user should have two properties: 1) a\nuser\u2019s presence is not advertised, even anonymously, and\n2) entities outside of the user\u2019s control are not entrusted with\ngathering signal times-of-arrival or with calculating the\nuser\u2019s location; otherwise, these entities may relay that data\nto other parties without permission.\nIn order to have the first property, the location system\nshould be designed such that mobile units do not need to\nemit any sort of detectable signal. By detecting emission of a\nsignal, an observer might be able to infer the number of\nusers present in an area. To have the second property, a\nmobile unit must use its own sensors to detect ranging\nsignals broadcast from places in the environment, thus\navoiding reliance on external sensing devices. Additionally,\nthe mobile unit must have knowledge of the surveyed\nlocations of the environmental transmitters, so that it may\ncalculate its position autonomously using the times-of-\narrival it gathers. Cricket is an example of a privacy-\noriented location system.\nDolphin prototypes were deployed as a privacy-oriented\nsystem [31], with seven ceiling transmitters which broadcast\nsimultaneously using the DS\/CDMA signal structure\ndescribed above. A mobile receiver was placed at the same\n64 test locations used in the polled, centralized system\nexperiments. As before, the speed of sound in air was\nestimated with the aid of a temperature sensor and a\nworkstation PC performed the signal processing.\n5.2.1 Location Estimation\nThe narrowband ultrasonic location systems reviewed\nabove and the polled, centralized system just presented\nutilize synchronized transmitters and receivers. In synchro-\nnous ultrasonic location systems, receivers have knowledge\nof when ranging signals depart from transmitters. Thus,\nthey can directly measure the signal times-of-flight and\nconvert them to transmitter-to-receiver distances using the\nspeed of sound in air. Location is then computed using a\nmultilateration algorithm.\nWith the privacy-oriented system described in this\npaper, the case of receivers operating asynchronously can\nalso be considered. Asynchronous receivers do not have\nexplicit knowledge of when ranging signals depart from\ntransmitters. Rather, they only know when transmitters\nsend their signals with respect to one another. With this\nknowledge, it is possible for a receiver to gather a number\nof times-of-arrival and calculate its position, despite the fact\nthat it cannot measure signal times-of-flight directly.\nSince the transmitter-to-receiver distances are unknown,\nconventional multilateration cannot be applied. However, a\nreceiver can pick an arbitrary point in time from which to\nreference its signal time-of-flight measurements. Assuming\nknowledge of the times when transmitters broadcast\nrelative to one another, the receiver can create a set of\npseudoranges. The pseudoranges are not the actual transmit-\nter-to-receiver ranges; instead, the gathered pseudoranges\nhave an equal offset from the true transmitter-to-receiver\ndistances. The distance offset is directly related to the\ndifference between the time at which the transmitters began\nsending their ranging signals and the time arbitrarily\nchosen by the receiver to begin taking data. GPS receivers\nutilize pseudoranging since a receiver\u2019s clock is not\nnecessarily synchronized with the system-wide clock.\nTo arrive at a location estimate, four pseudoranges are\nrequired since the unknown distance offset must be\nestimated in addition to the receiver\u2019s 3D coordinates. If a\nmeasure of the standard error is desired, five or more\npseudoranges are needed. Details of a regression-based\nlocation algorithm which employs pseudoranges have been\npreviously described [31].\nCompared to receivers in synchronous systems, asyn-\nchronous receivers have the disadvantage that they must\ngather one more signal time-of-arrival in order to compute a\nlocation. Also, their location estimates tend not to be as\naccurate since the algorithm must fit four parameters to the\ndata instead of three. However, the advantage of asynchro-\nnous receivers is that they do not need the capability to\nreceive a wireless synchronization signal.\nAs with the polled, centralized system, it was required\nthat the standard error be estimated, so that sets of\nincongruous readings can be rejected by the algorithm.\nThus, in the results presented below, at least four transmitter\nsignals must be detected for each location reading in the\nsynchronous system and five for the asynchronous system.\nThe algorithm does not return a position estimate if there\nare too few signals detected, or if the location solution has a\nhigh error estimate.\n5.2.2 Results\nFive hundred location measurements were taken at each of\nthe 64 test points to assess system performance, for both\nsynchronous and asynchronous receiver operation. Fig. 16\nshows the accuracy distribution of the readings, and Table 3\nreports the 95 percent confidence levels of the 3D position\nestimates (and their horizontal component), as well as the\nfraction of readings returned by the algorithms.\nThe 3D accuracy of a synchronous receiver is better than\n5 cm in 95 percent of cases, a level competitivewith that of the\nsystems previously discussed. The 95 percent 3D accuracy of\nan asynchronous receiver ismuchworse\u2014over 25 cm. This is\nbecause the nearly coplanar placement of ceiling transmitters\ncreates an interdependency between two of the quantities\nestimated by the location algorithm\u2014the distance offset of\nthe pseudoranges and the vertical component of position. As\nTable 3 indicates, the vertical error component contributes far\nmore to the asynchronous receiver\u2019s 3D position error than\nthe horizontal error component. However, many location-\naware applications require only that the horizontal positions\nof people and objects be fine-grained; the vertical component\ntends to be less significant. Although the asynchronous\nreceiver\u2019s 3D accuracy is much worse than that provided by\nsome existing systems with synchronized receivers, it can\nstill provide location data with a horizontal 95 percent\naccuracy of less than ten centimeters.\nThe number of readings returned by the asynchronous\nreceiver was about 20 percent lower than those returned\nby the synchronous receiver. This is because the asynchro-\nnous receiver needs to detect at least five signal times-of-\narrival to calculate its location and an error estimate,\nwhereas the synchronous receiver only requires four. Thus,\n544 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MOBILE COMPUTING, VOL. 5, NO. 5, MAY 2006\nthe asynchronous receiver had to identify five of the\nseven available transmitter signals.\nAlso, at heights close to the ceiling, many synchronous\nand asynchronous receiver readings failed to return enough\ntimes-of-arrival to perform multilateration. Characterized\npreviously [31], this effect occurred because of the radiation\npattern of the Dolphin transmitters and their particular\narrangement on the ceiling. The proportion of readings\nreturned for both types of receiver operation can be much\nimproved by adding a few more transmitters to the system,\nor slightly modifying their ceiling placement scheme, as\nproposed elsewhere [31].\n5.2.3 Advantages\nSince a receiver can successfully detect the multiple,\nsimultaneously sent ranging signals, the broadband system\nallows superior per-receiver update rates. With the signal\nstructure chosen, the location update rate of each mobile\nunit performing back-to-back correlation operations would\nbe 40 Hz for both the synchronous and asynchronous cases.\nThis is superior to previous narrowband privacy-oriented\nsystems (Section 2.1).\nSimilarly, the DS\/CDMA simultaneous ranging signals\nenable increased dynamic tracking performance. Receivers in\nprivacy-oriented systems employing narrowband ultra-\nsound must measure times-of-arrival from transmitters\nindividually, one at a time. For users and devices which\nare in motion during the measurement process, this means\nthat the collected signal times-of-arrival may not corre-\nspond well, resulting in a loss of location accuracy. It is\npossible to partially alleviate this by including the receiver\nvelocity as a parameter in the location model, using single-\nconstraint-at-a-time tracking [7]. However, removing the\nsingle transmitter constraint altogether with a broadband\nsolution would only improve the performance of such\ntechniques.\nLast, the experiments show that location systems using\nbroadband ultrasound can have enhanced identification\nencoding. Assuming transmitters are assigned unique\nspreading codes, their signals can be identified by the\nreceiver. This removes the need to identify them using some\nother means of communication, which can be beneficial for\nsystems where many transmitters are sending simulta-\nneously at high rates. Also, as shown by the experiments\nwith the asynchronous receiver, individually identifiable\nsignals are also crucial for systems in which there is no\ndedicated communications channel.\n5.3 Modifications Needed for Production Systems\nAs mentioned above, the Dolphin units were designed to be\nflexible, for application in experimental location systems. In\norder to realize wide-area location system deployments for\neveryday use by many people, a number of changes would\nneed to be made.\nBoth the transmitter and the receiver are too large and\nbulky to be used as mobile tags or unobtrusively installed in\nthe environment. Before being deployed for everyday use,\nthe devices would be reengineered, and parts chosen which\nare more appropriate for small, unobtrusive devices. For\nunits intended to be mobile, components could be chosen\nwhich have sufficiently low operating voltages so that they\ncould be powered by a single-cell battery.\nIn the experiments presented in this paper, Fast Fourier\nTransform (FFT) operations running in software on the\nworkstation PC were used to correlate the received signals\nwith the expected spread spectrum waveforms. Since FFTs\nare computationally expensive, specialized hardware cor-\nrelators would most likely be employed in a deployable\nversion of the Dolphin receiver unit. Miniaturization of an\nintegrated receiver unit is certainly feasible\u2014GPS receivers,\nwhich perform essentially the same operations at much\nhigher speeds, have been successfully engineered to fit into\nPCMCIA cards.\n6 CONCLUSION\nThis paper has reported on the exploration of broadband\nultrasonic location systems. Because broadband systems\ncan utilize spread spectrum, multiple access techniques in\ntheir ranging signals, they have the potential for signifi-\ncantly higher performance in a number of aspects of system\noperation than narrowband ultrasonic location systems.\nThe Dolphin transmitter and receiver prototype hard-\nware was described and characterized in detail. Small,\ninexpensive piezopolymer transducer elements were em-\nployed in the units using a compact mounting method. The\nsensitivity characteristics of the receiver and transmitter\nprovide acceptable signal levels up to 45 degrees and\n60 degrees off-axis, respectively. The bandwidth of the\nresulting ultrasonic channel was shown to be much greater\nthan narrowband transducers allow, even at room-scale\ndistances and for transmitter and receiver units not directly\nfacing one another.\nHAZAS AND HOPPER: BROADBAND ULTRASONIC LOCATION SYSTEMS FOR IMPROVED INDOOR POSITIONING 545\nTABLE 3\nPrivacy-Oriented System Performance\nFig. 16. Accuracy of location estimates in the privacy-oriented system.\nAn appropriate DS\/CDMA ranging message signal\nstructure was then outlined and its ranging accuracy with\nthe Dolphin prototypes shown to be about half a centimeter.\nThe Dolphin units were used to create two broadband\nultrasonic location systems. A polled, centralized system\nwith ceiling receivers and roaming transmitters was shown\nto have 2 cm accuracy. A high fraction of the readings taken\nyielded a successful location result, especially with the\napplication of successive interference cancellation. A priv-\nacy-oriented system with ceiling transmitters and roaming\nreceivers had slightly less accuracy and fewer successful\nreadings, due primarily to differences in ceiling unit\ndeployment. Despite this, the privacy-oriented system\nperformance is appropriate for many fine-grained, mobile\ncomputing applications.\nMost importantly, both systems have a number of\nadvantages over their narrowband counterparts. The\nperformance enhancements for location systems using\nbroadband ultrasound can be summarized as follows:\n1. Noise robustness. Ranging signals can be resolved\nin the presence of in-band noise, allowing the system\nto continue to return location updates even when\nsensors are colocated with aggressive noise sources.\n2. Increased update rates. Simultaneous multiple\naccess signals allow many transmitters to be de-\ntected, without the restriction that transmitters emit\nranging signals one-at-a-time. This manifests vastly\nincreased aggregate update rates for polled, centra-\nlized systems, and much improved per-receiver\nupdate rates for privacy-oriented architectures.\n3. Low-latency positioning. Simultaneous multiple\naccess signaling can also provide negligible latency\nbetween ranging measurements to different trans-\nmitters. In polled, centralized systems, this means\nlocation updates for multiple people and devices can\nbe nearly simultaneous. In privacy-oriented systems,\nthis much improves the dynamic tracking capacity\nfor mobile users.\n4. Enhanced identification encoding. Since broadband\nsignals have a much greater capacity to carry\ninformation, transmitter signals can be uniquely\nidentified at the receiver. This can reduce the load on\nother wireless communication channels available\n(such as radio or infrared) and, in some cases, avoid\nreliance on external channels altogether.\nFor a more detailed look at the concepts, devices, and\nsystems presented in this paper, the reader is referred\nelsewhere [32].\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nMike Hazas is grateful to Andy Ward for his guidance\nthroughout the PhD process.
