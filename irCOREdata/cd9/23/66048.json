Health is about more than simply\ntreating illness. It must encompass improving people\u2019s\nchances of living a healthy life throughout their lifetime.\nHowever, in the NHS, health is being interpreted through the\nnarrow prism of ill health and disease. How will this enable\nthe NHS to contribute to the struggle to create communities\nthat are truly healthy, where people participate in creating a\nsense of wellbeing for themselves and for their communities?\nThe issues are not confined to the British NHS but can be\nfound to exist to a greater or lesser degree in many healthcare\nsystems in Europe and elsewhere.6\nPart of the problem may result from a lack of clarity over\nthe public health function. Arguably, there exists no other\nfunction that seeks to embrace such a broad range of discrete\nactivities to be undertaken by a single specialty or group of\npractitioners. The Faculty of Public Health suggests that there\nare three areas of public health practice that it seeks to cover\nin its work: health protection, health improvement, and\nhealth service quality. While displaying some overlap, each of\nthese areas arguably demands its own particular skills,\ncompetences, and knowledge. Perhaps greater clarity and\nfocus is required if public health is to deliver with equal\nconfidence in each of these areas, especially in respect of\nhealth improvement that demands skills from a range of\nagencies outside the NHS and located within communities.\nFor many engaged in public health, its core purpose is\nhealth improvement and the wider agenda in respect of the\ndeterminants of health and how these can be addressed. That\nis certainly our concern in this paper because we believe that\nit is the primary function of public health and one that is\nbeing seriously eroded at a time, paradoxically, when\ngovernment policy is seeking to advance its cause.7\nPublic health will only regain its core purpose by forging\npartnerships with local communities. Conceivably, this might\nbe achieved through primary care trusts (PCTs) in England\nand there are high, if diminishing, hopes that they will\ndeliver on such a change agenda. But concern is mounting\namong appointed directors of public health, among others,\nthat perhaps PCTs neither provide the optimal location to\nlead such a shift in health policy nor possess sufficient\ncapacity to perform effectively. To be sure, PCTs are charged\nwith the task of assessing and supporting the health needs of\ntheir populations but the reality is that they are overwhelmed\nwith the short term needs of the NHS modernisation agenda.\nDelivering on healthcare targets in respect of access and\nwaiting times is diverting public health practitioners from\ntheir core business\u2014a classic example of the counter-\nproductive and dysfunctional nature of a \u2018\u2018target culture\u2019\u2019 in\npublic services.8 It is making many wonder if the lead role for\npublic health should remain with the NHS or perhaps shift to\nlocal government although such a move is not without its\nown problems and risks.\nMore to the point, what has the public health function\ncontributed to improving the health of those with the worst\nhealth experience? Academic public health has played its part\nin highlighting the issue, and directors of public health\nannual reports have served to provide a local focus on health\ninequalities but may not have resulted in much positive\nchange. The thrust of most service public health work in the\nNHS has been to facilitate the implementation of NHS\npriorities, including national service frameworks, which are\nprimarily service oriented. In performing this role, public\nhealth practitioners tend to work in a way that is isolated\nfrom contact with local communities.\nThe need to tackle the dramatic health gap across the\nequally dramatic socioeconomic divide constitutes the most\nimportant public health issue facing the United Kingdom\nand, indeed, most industrialised countries. Those working in\npublic health should be encouraged to devote their energies\nto improving the health prospects for many minority groups\nwithin society whose health experience, and experience of\nhealth services, have been unsatisfactory and inexcusable in a\ncivilised society. The health inequalities picture in Britain has\nbeen well reported over many years,9\u201311 yet action to tackle\nthese inequalities, despite the setting of national targets,\nremains unimpressive. Indeed, in its most recent policy\nstatement, the government almost concedes as much. In\nTackling Health Inequalities: Programme for Action there is an\nacceptance that health inequalities \u2018\u2018are stubborn, persistent\nand difficult to change. They are also widening and will\ncontinue to do so unless we do things differently\u2019\u2019.12\nIn another important policy development, and at the\nrequest of the government, former banker, Derek Wanless,\ncompleted a review of public health policy aimed at assessing\nprogress in implementing the \u2018\u2018fully engaged\u2019\u2019 scenario for\nhealth that he articulated in his earlier report for the Treasury\nthat looked at the future funding of the NHS over a 20 year\nperiod until 2022.13 In that report, Wanless made much of the\nfact that investing in health was good economics.14 His\nsecond report, directed to the prime minister, chancellor, and\nsecretary of state for health, is critical of the failure of policy\nover some 30 years to shift the NHS from being an ill health\nto a health service.15 Most of the report\u2019s 21 recommenda-\ntions represent an agenda for action. The failure to make\nprogress is perceived as principally a technical one resulting\nfrom lack of sound evidence, underinvestment in research\nand development, and an antipathy towards rigorous\neconomic analysis of interventions to establish their cost\neffectiveness. Wanless is especially critical of PCTs and their\nundeveloped capacity to pursue a public health agenda.\nHowever, he regards them as critically important. To secure a\npopulation that is fully engaged in their health, Wanless\nrecommends interventions designed to raise levels of health\nliteracy among the public. In particular, he wants to see the\npublic consulted about the balance between state interven-\ntions on the one hand and a person\u2019s right to choose on the\nother.\nThe government\u2019s response to Wanless II was swift. It\nlaunched a major public consultation exercise, Choosing\n265\nwww.jech.com\n on 5 November 2009 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \nHealth, to culminate in a white paper expected in the autumn\n2004, which will set out the government\u2019s approach to public\nhealth to rebalance the NHS from being a sickness service to\na health one.16 The policy statement is expected to be\nprincipally concerned with delivery and with the principles\nof change management in public health. Leadership in public\nhealth is likely to figure prominently. Empowering the public\nto take more direct responsibility for their health is also likely\nto be a major theme and is consistent with other policy\nthemes, including local devolution, fewer centrally imposed\ntargets, and making choice available to all to reduce\ninequalities.\nOne of us (Crowley) has worked in an inner city area in the\nnorth east of England for many years. It is clear from this\nexperience that if we are to create the conditions in which the\nhealth of individuals and communities can flourish, action is\nneeded on a whole range of social issues that determine the\nlikelihood that a person will lead a long and healthy life.\nWorking in the West End of Newcastle upon Tyne17 showed\nthe limitations of what the NHS could achieve in economic-\nally deprived communities and with marginalised groups.\nPeople in the West End experienced some of the worst health\noutcomes in the country and their access to health services\nwas limited. Those with the worst levels of heart disease had\nthe lowest referral rates to hospital treatment and there were\nobstacles for ethnic minorities in accessing secondary care\nmirroring the experience elsewhere.\nIf the wider picture of health inequalities is genuinely to be\ntransformed, action will have to tackle the broader determi-\nnants of health and actively involve the community\nexperiencing these inequalities. Competition for funding\nhas reinforced a national tendency to see poorer communities\nin terms of their deficits and weaknesses. This approach leads\nhealth professionals and others to ignore the many skills,\ncommitments, and capacities that local communities can\nbring to the struggle to improve their own health. We need to\nstart looking at communities in terms of mapping their\ncapacities and abilities to sort out their own problems18 rather\nthan endlessly reporting their deficits.\nThere are many ways to involve local communities.19 20 One\nthat has a particular focus on improving the health of\nminority groups and tackling inequalities is the community\ndevelopment approach.21 Community development entails\nworking with local communities experiencing social exclu-\nsion and health inequalities so that they can develop their\ncollective agenda and then act on that agenda by engaging\ndecision makers in the relevant organisations so that health\ninequalities can be addressed. The Involving Patients and the\nPublic in Healthcare discussion document22 commits the NHS\nto involving patients and local people in health decisions.\nCommunity development linked to primary care has been the\nsubject of publications for a decade or more.23\u201328 One study\nsuggested that over 60% of PCTs are funding community\ndevelopment activity.29 There has also been a long history of\ncommunity development projects focusing on health, but\nwithout health service funding or connections.30 Some\nresearchers have seen PCT involvement of local communities\nas the key to their developing their public health role.31 A\nsystematic review suggested that involving patients has\ncontributed to changes in health service provision, but the\neffects of these on quality of care have not been reported.32\nProgrammes of work undertaken in Newcastle to tackle\nhealth inequalities and involve local communities (including\ncommunities of identity and interest such as the deaf\ncommunity and the gay community) arose from such\ncommunity development initiatives.33\nThrough a community development project in Newcastle,\nCommunity Action on Health, contact was made with a large\nnumber of community organisations to develop with them\ntheir agenda on health. Meetings with the deaf community\nhighlighted their lack of access to both primary and\nsecondary care. So with health services failing those in\ngreatest need and the issues that created ill health being\nignored, community development work to engage local\ncommunities started to broaden the public health agenda to\ninclude issues that communities saw as affecting their health.\nLocal people identified lack of access to safe play areas, lack\nof access to exercise facilities, poor housing, and social\nisolation as key health issues.17\nThe dialogue that developed as a result of the project\u2019s\nwork between local communities and the health services and\npublic health in particular led to a number of initiatives to\nimprove wellbeing in the area. A peer led family support\ninitiative worked to support vulnerable families from all\ncommunities. An interagency group worked with young\npeople to develop a youth inquiry service to meet the needs as\nexpressed by local young people at a youth base. In parallel\nwith these developments, access to health services for local\ncommunities was also improved as the community engage-\nment served to highlight the service access inequalities.\nSo what of the future role of public health? Most public\nhealth activity continues to be focused on PCTs. At first sight,\nthis helpfully locates public health at a level that is some-\ntimes, though by no means commonplace, co-terminous with\nlocal government boundaries and at which local communities\nare accustomed to articulating their concerns. Directors of\npublic health (DsPH) in PCTs have a great opportunity to\nestablish a new face for public health in the NHS. They can\nact as catalysts for partnerships with communities, local\nauthorities, academic institutes, the voluntary sector, and the\nprivate sector and through local strategic partnerships that\nbring all these stakeholders together ensure a programme of\naction to tackle the issues that unfairly limit people\u2019s\npotential to achieve a healthy and long life.\nPCTs must develop relationships of trust over time as\ncommunities are supported to become active drivers of\nprogrammes to tackle the health inequalities that they\nexperience. DsPH must become funders of, and supporters\nof community development initiatives in their local commu-\nnities. Their public health work programme will then reflect\nthe expressed priorities of local communities. With the active\nparticipation of local communities themselves, public health\ncould play a pivotal part in confronting its greatest\nchallenge\u2014the widening gap in health outcomes between\nrich and poor, and between majority and minority commu-\nnities. In this way a new public health may emerge in the\nNHS, one that is relevant, effective, and seen as vital to\nimproving health by the very communities it seeks to serve.\nWhat this paper adds\nN The fact that public health in the NHS is being directed\nto health service modernisation at the expense of health\nimprovement is questioned.\nN The need for public health to be relevant to and link\nwith local communities, especially those experiencing\nhealth inequalities is emphasised.\nPolicy implications\nPublic health must rebalance its focus on health service\nmodernisation with a greater emphasis on linking its work\nwith local communities to tackle health inequalities.\n266 Crowley, Hunter\nwww.jech.com\n on 5 November 2009 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \nPublic health should be seizing the opportunity offered by\nits positioning at PCT level by engaging with local commu-\nnities and community development initiatives and by work-\ning in partnership with local authorities and other key\nagencies. In these ways, it could play a key part in creating\nhealthier communities for the future. But, as Wanless warns,\nit may be that the \u2018\u2018downstream\u2019\u2019 acute healthcare agenda\nwill continue to swamp public health in PCTs and make it all\nbut impossible to achieve the gains in health improvement so\nurgently needed. Only if such an extreme bias and imbalance\npersists should serious consideration be given to relocating\nthe leadership role for public health from the NHS and PCTs\nto local government. Such a move by no means offers a\nsimple panacea but it would recognise the natural leadership\nrole local authorities ought to be exercising in respect of their\nwide range of functions, virtually all of which have a health\ndimension. Indeed, local authorities already have a respon-\nsibility for looking after the social wellbeing of their\ncommunities. Moreover, local authorities have more experi-\nence of working with and through local communities that\ncan form the basis of closer links between people and their\nhealth. What cannot continue is support for a status quo that\nis singularly failing many of the most vulnerable groups in\nsociety.\nAuthors\u2019 affiliations\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nP Crowley, Institute of Public Health in Ireland\nD J Hunter, School for Health, Wolfson Research Institute, University of\nDurham, UK\nFunding: none.\nConflicts of interest: none declared.\nCorrespondence to: Dr P Crowley, Institute of Public Health in Ireland,\n5th Floor, Bishop\u2019s Square, Redmond\u2019s Hill, Dublin 2, Ireland;\nphilip.Crowley@publichealth.ie\nAccepted for publication 5 October 2004\nREFERENCES\n1 Lewis J.
