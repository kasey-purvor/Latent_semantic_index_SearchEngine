Introduction\n[2] Ice cores provide a wealth of information about past\nclimate and atmospheric circulation. They are especially\nvaluable in remote areas such as Antarctica where long-term\nobservations or historical records are sparse and short. The\nsnow accumulation records preserved in Antarctic ice cores\nhave been used to investigate changes in surface mass\nbalance, of particular importance in relation to sea level\nrise, and have been used in recent studies on the Antarctic\nPeninsula to relate to changes in atmospheric circulation,\nnotably the Southern Hemisphere Annular Mode (SAM)\n[Miles et al., 2008; Thomas et al., 2008]. Further proxy\nrecords, such as the relationship between stable isotopes and\ntemperature [Dansgaard, 1964; Jouzel et al., 1997] have\nbeen used to reconstruct Antarctic temperatures over a range\nof timescales [EPICA Community Members, 2004;\nSchneider et al., 2006; Schneider and Steig, 2008]. In\naddition, the interpretation of aerosols and chemical species\ncontained within the ice have been used as tracers for long-\nrange atmospheric transport and loading, such as the\nanalysis of continental dust [Legrand et al., 1988; Basile\net al., 1997], and local source changes, including the\nestimation of sea ice extent from marine biogenic species\n[Curran et al., 2003; Abram et al., 2007] and sea salts\n[Wolff et al., 2006]. The ability to reconstruct climate in\nisolated areas on timescales that exceed the observational\nperiod make ice cores a valuable tool in understanding\nclimate change. A region of particular interest is the\nAntarctic Peninsula, which has experienced dramatic\nwarming in recent decades, larger than anywhere else in\nthe Southern Hemisphere [Vaughan et al., 2003]. The\nmeteorological observations from Faraday station (renamed\nVernadsky station) on the western Peninsula indicate a\nwarming of more than 2.9\u0002C between 1951 and 2005 [King\nand Comiso, 2003] while increasing temperatures on the\neastern side have led to the collapse of floating ice shelves\nand the retreat of marine glacier fronts [Cook et al., 2005].\n[3] Although warming on both sides of the Peninsula is\nattributed to changes in atmospheric circulation, the very\nlarge (mostly winter) warming at Faraday is thought to be\ndriven by an increase in northerlies since the late 1950s\ncombined with a strong coupling between temperature and\nregional sea ice extent [King, 1994; King and Harangozo,\n1998]. By comparison, the large summer warming over the\nnortheast of the Peninsula, which is responsible for the\ncollapse of the northern sections of the Larsen ice shelf, is\ndue to the intensification of westerlies [Marshall et al.,\n2006]. These changes in the westerlies project strongly onto\nthe SAM, which is the principal mode of atmospheric\nvariability in the Southern Hemisphere, defined as negative\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 114, D20116, doi:10.1029\/2009JD012263, 2009\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1British Antarctic Survey, Natural Environment Research Council,\nCambridge, UK.\nCopyright 2009 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/09\/2009JD012263$09.00\nD20116 1 of 8\n(positive) pressure anomalies over Antarctica and positive\n(negative) pressure anomalies in the midlatitudes.\n[4] If we are going to understand the mechanisms behind\nthe recent changes on the Antarctic Peninsula, or indeed the\nsignificance on longer timescales, we must incorporate\nthe proxy records. However, interpretation of all ice core\u2013\nderived climate proxies is dependent on the local and\nregional climate affecting the ice core site and the influence\nof small-scale weather patterns. In this paper we evaluate\nthe precipitation and the air mass trajectory pathways\naffecting an ice core site, Gomez, on the southwestern\nAntarctic Peninsula, to assess its value as a proxy for past\nclimate and atmospheric circulation. Of particular interest is\ndetermining if we can obtain a record of past atmospheric\ncirculation and sea ice extent, changes in both of which\nhave been suggested as mechanisms for the recent warming.\nWe utilize the available data from the Gomez ice core,\ntogether with the European Centre for Medium-Range\nWeather Forecasts (ECMWF) operational analysis and\nreanalyses data and in situ data from an automatic weather\nstation to characterize the atmospheric conditions\ninfluencing the Gomez site in order to better interpret the\nice core data.\n2. Method and Data\n[5] The Gomez ice core (GZ07) is a medium-depth\n(136 m) ice core drilled in a high-accumulation site\n(73.59\u0002S, 70.36\u0002W, mean annual accumulation 0.87 m\nwater equivalent yr\u00021, 1400 m above sea level (asl)) on\nthe southwestern Antarctic Peninsula during 2007 [Thomas\net al., 2008]. The ice core was cut into 550 mm sections and\npacked in the field into polythene layflat tubing (to avoid\ncontamination) and insulated boxes for transport to the\nUnited Kingdom. Subsequently, continuous longitudinal\nsamples with a cross section of 34 mm \u0003 34 mm were\ncut and transported to the Desert Research Institute, for\ntrace element analysis. The samples were analyzed at very\nhigh resolution (\u000410 mm, average 90 samples per year)\nusing the Continuous Flow Analysis with Trace Elements-\nDual (CFA-TED) method adapted from McConnell et al.\n[2002] for a broad range of elements and chemical species.\nThe accumulation recordwas derived from thewinterminima\nof hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and the summer maxima in\nnon\u2013sea salt sulphate. An earlier 20 m shallow core (GZ05)\nwas drilled at the site in January 2005 (R. J. Arthern et al.,\nDirect in situ measurements of Antarctic snow compaction,\nsubmitted to Journal of Geophysical Research, 2009). The\nGZ05 core was dated using the summer-summer maxima in\nsulphate and melthysolfonic acid (MSA), analyzed using a\nDionex ion chromatograph. The accumulation records from\nboth cores were converted into water equivalents based on\ndensity and corrected for ice thinning using a simple Nye\nmodel [Nye, 1963], which assumes a linear vertical strain\nrate. The GZ07 record encompasses the period 1854\u20132006,\nwhile GZ05 captures 1994\u20132004.\n[6] In situ weather observations were recorded using an\nautomatic weather station (AWS) deployed to the Gomez\nsite in January 2005 (R. J. Arthern et al., submittedmanuscript,\n2009). The Gomez ice core (GZ07) was drilled 500 m from\nthe site of the AWS, to minimize the risk of contamination or\nsnow surface disturbance induced during its deployment.\nStudies of accumulation variability and topographic effects\nwere carried out using ground-penetrating radar (GPR), from\na total of seven GPR transects run from the central drill site\nusing 100 and 200 MHz antenna to recover both high- and\nlow-resolution reflections. The impact of thinning as a result\nof flow was estimated using the GPR horizons and Global\nPositioning System (GPS) measurements. Hourly measure-\nments of wind speed, wind direction, surface temperature,\nand snow accumulation are available until December 2006,\nwhen the AWS was buried by accumulating snow.\n[7] The data from ECMWF operational analysis\n(2002\u20132006) and the 40-year reanalysis (ERA-40) [Uppala\net al., 2005] have been used to estimate precipitation\nbetween 1980 and 2006, using a Gaussian N80 grid with\na resolution of \u0004125 km, interpolated to the Gomez site\nto the nearest 0.1\u0002 latitude and longitude. The ERA-40\nreanalysis is thought to be reliable at the high southern\nlatitudes after 1979, when satellite observations were\nassimilated into the model, and is generally considered\nmore accurate than National Center for Atmospheric\nResearch\u2013National Centers for Environmental Prediction\noutput for Antarctica [Marshall, 2003; Bromwich and Fogt,\n2004; Bromwich et al., 2007]. ERA-40 correlates with ice\ncore accumulation records from West Antarctica [Genthon\net al., 2005] and is believed to represent precipitation\nvariability across the majority of the Antarctic Peninsula\n[Miles et al., 2008]. Three-dimensional air mass back\ntrajectories, employed to assess the source of precipitation\nand climate proxies reaching the Gomez site, were provided\nby the British Atmospheric Data Centre (BADC) (for more\ninformation contact badc@rl.ac.uk) trajectory service\n(available at http:\/\/badc.nerc.ac.uk) using ECMWF archived\n2.5\u0002 \u0003 2.5\u0002 data.\n3. Results and Discussion\n[8] The air mass bringing precipitation to the Gomez site\nis of vital importance in understanding the source of climate\nproxies preserved in the ice core. In order to estimate\nchanges in sea ice extent, from the sea salts and biogenic\nspecies contained in the ice core, we must first understand\nwhich sea ice region has the greatest influence on the data.\nThe same is true of the stable isotopic composition of\nprecipitation (the ratio of 18O\/16O, expressed as d18O), that\nexhibits a linear relationship with temperature in high\nlatitudes [Dansgaard, 1964] and is dependent upon the\ntemperature and humidity of the evaporative source, the\nair parcel trajectory, and the final condensation temperature\nof the air parcel. Back trajectories from ECMWF can\nprovide a powerful tool for understanding source regions,\ntransport pathways, and the proximity of trajectory path-\nways to reliable in situ observations, such as research\nstations or other ice core sites. However, we must first\nevaluate the ability of ECMWF to capture accumulation\nvariability at the ice core site.\n3.1. Accumulation Variability\n3.1.1. Subannual Accumulation Variability\nFrom in Situ Measurements and Operational Analysis\n[9] TheAWS located at the ice core site during 2005\u20132006\nprovides an hourly record of accumulation variability. The\nclose proximity of the AWS to the ice core site ensures that\nD20116 THOMAS AND BRACEGIRDLE: IMPROVING ICE CORE INTERPRETATION\n2 of 8\nD20116\nlocalized synoptic-scale precipitation events, periods of\nablation, and wind-blown snow deposition that affect\nthe ice core will be recorded. If the operational analyses\nare able to capture this subseasonal variability, then we\ncan have confidence that the operational and reanalysis\ndata will be representative of subseasonal changes occurring\nin the ice core.\n[10] The AWS record of snow surface height is influenced\nby changes in precipitation, ablation, densification, and\nwind-blown deposition and erosion of snow. In order to\nextract precipitation changes at the site, negative accumu-\nlation values (resulting from ablation and densification) can\nbe removed. However, it is not possible to distinguish\nbetween precipitation and accumulation from snow drift.\nStudies of wind transport in the Antarctic Peninsula estimate\nthat as much as 5% of surface snow is removed by wind\ntransport across the whole peninsula region [van Lipzig et\nal., 2004]. The amount of snow ablation is strongly\ncontrolled by wind, which is in turn influenced by\norography. The winds are stronger on the eastern side of\nthe Peninsula than the western side, and the gentle sloping\ngradient in the southwestern peninsula probably indicates\nthat a much smaller effect of wind-blown transport of snow\nwill be observed at the Gomez site, where the average wind\nspeed from the AWS and the operational analysis (March\n2005 to June 2006) is 6 m s\u00021. Indeed, analysis of the GPR\nhorizons, which are generally accepted to result from\ndensity changes caused by layers of isochronous deposition\nof snow [Vaughan et al., 1999], reveal only a small amount\nof accumulation variability at the site, typically less than a\n1% change in annual layer thickness across a 20 km radius\nfrom the GZ07 ice core site.\n[11] The monthly accumulation recorded by the AWS and\nthe monthly precipitation minus evaporation (P \u0002 E) from\nECMWF operational data for the period March 2005 to\nJune 2006 are shown in Figure 1a. The accumulation from\nthe ice core is calculated using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a\nphotochemical species with a strong seasonal cycle which\nreaches a minimum during the winter solstice [McConnell et\nal., 1997]. Therefore, annual accumulation in the ice core is\nassumed to start on 20 June and subsequently in the analysis\nof the monthly data from the AWS and the ECMWF data\nthe month starts on the twentieth day. The correlation\nbetween monthly AWS snow accumulation and monthly\nECMWF precipitation for the period between March 2005\nand June 2006 is 0.88 (significant at the 99% level)\nwith comparable monthly wind speeds (r = 0.62, >95%\nsignificance) indicating that the ECMWF fields capture a\nlarge amount of the precipitation variability at the site.\n3.1.2. Annual Accumulation Variability From in Situ\nMeasurements and Operational Analysis\n[12] In order to assess how well the accumulation record\nfrom the AWS captures the accumulation in the ice core, the\nannual accumulation for the period June 2005 to June 2006\nis compared. On the basis of the snow depth from the AWS,\nwhich does not account for densification or snow compac-\ntion, the total snowfall (264 m) is just 76 mm higher than\nthat of the accumulation derived from the ice core, implying\nthat the AWS is able to reliably estimate most of the snow\naccumulation at this site. Thus, we can utilize the AWS\nFigure 1. (a) Monthly precipitation from the AWS (solid circle) and P \u0002 E from ECMWF operational\nanalysis (dashed cross) between March 2005 and June 2006. (b) Annual P \u0002 E from the ECMWF\noperational (dashed cross), ERA-40 reanalysis (dashed triangle), RACMO14 (dashed square), and the\nGZ07 (solid circle) GZ05 (solid triangle) ice core accumulation in millimeter water equivalents, between\n1980 and 2005.\nD20116 THOMAS AND BRACEGIRDLE: IMPROVING ICE CORE INTERPRETATION\n3 of 8\nD20116\nmonthly accumulation record to test the capability of the\noperational analysis.\n3.1.3. Annual Accumulation Variability\nFrom the ERA-40 Reanalysis Data\n[13] Comparison between the annual P \u0002 E from the\nreanalysis (ERA-40) data and the accumulation from the\nGomez ice cores GZ07 and GZ05 (converted to millimeter\nwater equivalents using density) is shown in Figure 1b.\nBoth ice cores show a strong positive correlation (r = 0.84,\n>98% significance for GZ07 and r = 0.92, >98%\nsignificance for GZ05) between the annual accumulation\npreserved in the ice core records and the P \u0002 E estimated\nfrom the reanalysis data. The interannual variability\nrecorded in the ice core records is captured by the ERA-40\ndata; however, the amount of precipitation is consistently\nlower (average 260 mm yr\u00021) in the reanalysis data than is\npreserved in the ice cores. Small-scale postdepositional\nchanges, either as a result of wind-driven ablation or\naccumulation, will account for some of the variability;\nhowever, as discussed in section 3.1.1, these effects are\nexpected to be small. The different spatial resolution of the\ntwo approaches is probably responsible for the systematic\nlower values observed in ERA-40. The resolution of the ice\ncore is essentially only equal to the diameter of the drill, in\nthis case 104 mm, while the ERA-40 data operate on a grid\nspacing of \u0004125 km. The modeled orography of the\nAntarctic Peninsula is smoothed, severely underestimating\nthe actual height; thus, orographic-induced changes in\naccumulation will be lower than in reality. This is consistent\nwith the findings of Orr and Bechtold [2009] who\ncompared warm season precipitation over the Alps with\nECMWF short-range forecasts, which showed that the\nECMWF model underestimated light precipitation, i.e.,\n<10 mm d\u00021. This is known to be a long-standing bias in\nthe ECMWF model. Note that although the paper considers\nanalysis data (i.e., any available precipitation observations\nor satellite observations should correct for this bias), the\nlack of observations around Antarctica would suggest that\nthe analysis data would strongly follow the forecast data and\nunderestimate light precipitation. For further comparison the\nice core annual accumulation is compared with a regional\natmospheric model (RACMO14) with a horizontal grid\nspacing of 14 km during the period 1987\u20131993 [van Lipzig\net al., 2004] (Figure 1b). As with the ERA-40 annual P \u0002 E,\nthe RACMO14 P \u0002 E is highly correlated to the ice core\ndata (r = 0.84, >95% significance), but the underestimation\nin total P \u0002 E is less than ERA-40 (20% lower than the ice\ncore accumulation compared to 26% in ERA-40 for the\nsame 7 year period).\n3.2. Trajectory Pathways of Precipitation Preserved\nin the Ice Core Record\n[14] The three-dimensional back trajectories from BADC,\nusing ECMWF 40-year reanalysis (ERA-40) and the\noperational analysis, track the location of air parcels\nreaching a particular region and can provide valuable\ninformation about source locations and transport\nmechanisms of climate proxies captured in ice cores.\nTrajectories were run backward in time to track air parcels\nreaching the Gomez site over a period of up to 5 days.\nClimate parameters such as precipitation, surface tempera-\nture (inferred from stable isotopes), and chemical deposition\nvia wet deposition are only recorded in the ice core record at\na time when there was actual precipitation at the site.\nTherefore, we only need to investigate the air parcel\ntrajectories that resulted in precipitation at Gomez.\n3.2.1. Operational Analysis\n[15] For 2005 (February\u2013December) the AWS data\nreveal a total of 195 precipitation days compared to\n260 days from the operational analysis data. Much of this\nconstituted precipitation of less than 0.01 mm d\u00021 which\nwill have a negligible effect on the interpretation of the ice\ncore record, which is analyzed at a minimum of 100 times\nthis resolution. Therefore, a minimum threshold for\nprecipitation events was applied such that only events where\nthe amount of snowfall during a 24 h period exceeded the\nminimum ice core sampling resolution, in this case 10 mm,\nwere included. During 2005 the AWS data have a total of\n51 days above this threshold compared to 63 days in the\noperational analysis.\n3.2.2. ERA-40 Reanalysis\n[16] The spatial track density of 5 day back trajectories of\nair parcels reaching the Gomez site for all major precipita-\ntion events (>10 mm) during the period 1980\u20132001, is\nshown in Figure 2. Figure 2 represents 1380 individual\ntrajectories, including all moderate and heavy precipitation\nevents, and together account for 68% of the ice core snow\naccumulation during this period.\n[17] The majority of the air masses reaching the Gomez\nsite originate from the low-pressure systems from the\nBellingshausen Sea with the greatest density coming from\nthe northwest of Alexander Island, approximately 69\u0002S,\n72\u0002W. Most (83%) are from low-level air masses (below\n850 hPa) with only 2% originating from higher altitudes\n(above 750 hPa). This pattern also reflects the blocking\neffect of the Antarctic Peninsula, which with an average\nheight of \u00041000 m acts as an obstacle for the circumpolar\nwesterlies that dominate the atmospheric circulation around\nAntarctica [Orr et al., 2004]. The resulting air mass is\nunable to flow over the Antarctic Peninsula and is instead\ndirected south toward the Gomez site.\n[18] The spread of trajectory locations for the period\n1980\u20132001 is quite large, extending as far north as 50\u0002S\nFigure 2. Track densities from ERA-40 (1980\u20132001)\nshown as a percentage. On the basis of a total of 1380\nprecipitation events. The star indicates the location of the\nGomez ice core.\nD20116 THOMAS AND BRACEGIRDLE: IMPROVING ICE CORE INTERPRETATION\n4 of 8\nD20116\nand as far south as 75\u0002S. This broad source region could\nconfirm findings by Turner et al. [1997], in a study of\nprecipitation events at Faraday station, that the variability of\nprecipitation over the western Antarctic Peninsula is depen-\ndent on synoptic weather system activity. The trajectory\npaths from the northwest (Figure 2) will be largely a result\nof depression activity in the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Sea\nrelated to the climatological low-pressure system known as\nthe Amundsen-Bellingshausen low, a semipermanent low-\npressure system centered in the Ross and Amundsen seas\nthat governs the direction and magnitude of the meridional\nmoisture flux in this region.\n[19] The west to east spread extends from \u0004140\u0002W to\n\u000460\u0002W. There are a small number of trajectory paths that\nreach Gomez from an easterly location, indicating that some\nprecipitation is transported via less frequent easterly wind\nevents, either from a strong low-pressure region over the\nWeddell Sea, or from occasional strong synoptic easterlies\n[Schwerdtfeger, 1975]. It is also possible that these western\ntrajectory locations are an artifact of the ECMWF model,\nwhich underestimates the height of the Peninsula by as\nmuch as 50% while substantially overestimating its width.\nTo overcome this, the model incorporates a simulated\natmospheric flow that is heavily reliant on the subgrid\nparameterization of low-level blocking and gravity wave\nbreaking [Lott and Miller, 1997; Orr and Bechtold, 2009].\nThe smoothed orography of the ECMWF reanalysis system\nmight be spreading trajectories too far to the east due to the\n\"spread\" of the land sea mask, effectively adding land out\ninto the sea, which would act on the wind by blocking it.\n[20] The western spread of trajectories is probably the\nresult of the different wind speeds which allow a large\nspread of trajectory locations over the 5 day period prior to\nreaching the Gomez site. This may also be influenced by the\nseasonally dependent location of the Amundsen Sea low,\nwhich during summer weakens and moves east toward the\npeninsula [King and Turner, 1997].\n3.2.3. Seasonality of Precipitation Events\n[21] The average annual cycle of precipitation from\nERA-40 reveals a summer minimum in total precipitation\nat the Gomez site, which as one would expect corresponds\nto a minimum in the number of significant precipitation\nevents (>10 mm). Just 204 of the 1380 precipitation events\nbetween 1980 and 2001 fell in the months of December,\nJanuary, and February. The largest number of precipitation\nevents occurred during the autumn (429 days) followed by\nwinter (386 days) and spring (361 days).\n[22] Despite these seasonal variations, the effect on the\nice core proxies during the low-precipitation months may\nstill be significant. For example, the annual average isotopic\ncomposition from the ice core is precipitation biased, in that\nit is the sum of precipitation-only days; however, the\nmonthly or seasonal contribution to the isotopic contribu-\ntion is not uniform. Large changes in the source or trend of\nprecipitation during the winter and summer, the two\nextremes of site surface temperatures, will have a larger\ncontribution to the annual average isotope value than\nchanges during the autumn and spring months.\n[23] The trajectory track density is separated into seasons\nin Figure 3. There is a seasonal shift in the trajectory paths\nwhich is most apparent during the warmest months. The\nnorthern extent of the track densities during the summer\n(December, January, and February) is considerably less than\nthe other seasons (by approximately 5\u0002) and also reveals a\ngreater number of trajectory paths originating from east of\nthe Gomez site. The individual trajectories for all summer\nprecipitation events (1980\u20132001) are shown in Figure 4,\nwith pressure level indicated by the color of the lines. Two\nexplanations for this distinct summer pattern were identi-\nfied. First, a less stable vertical temperature gradient in the\nsummer months lessens the barrier effect of the peninsula\non the atmosphere thus allowing more frequent incursions\nof air from the Weddell Sea region. Second, the climato-\nlogical weakening and eastward shift of the Amundsen Sea\nlow in summer corresponds to a weakening of the westerly\nwind regime and a larger frequency of easterly wind events\nacross the peninsula.\n3.3. Comparison With Other Peninsula Ice Cores\n[24] In Figure 5 the annual track densities from the\nGomez site are compared with track densities from other\nice core locations on the Antarctic Peninsula: Dyer Plateau,\non the spine of the peninsula (70.80\u0002S, 64.52\u0002W, 2002 m\nasl) obtained in 1988 [Thompson et al., 1994] and James\nRoss Island, in the northeast of the Antarctic Peninsula\n(64.2\u0002S, 57\u0002W, 1600 m asl) drilled in 1998 [Aristarain et\nal., 2004]. The Gomez track densities reveal a dominant\nwesterly transport from the Bellingshausen Sea (with the\nexception of a small number of easterly trajectories during\nthe summer); however, the two more northern ice core\nlocations have a much larger number of trajectories from\nthe east. Therefore, the climate signal contained within these\ncores will be influenced by two very different climate\nregimes. This might explain why the snow accumulation\nrecords from Dyer Plateau and James Ross Island are poorly\ncorrelated with Gomez and do not mirror the dramatic\nincrease in accumulation observed in the southwestern\nPeninsula [Thomas et al., 2008].\n3.4. Effect of the Transport Pathways on the Ice Core\nProxies\n[25] The back trajectories from this study confirm\nprevious findings that precipitation reaching the southwestern\nPeninsula, and hence the Gomez site, are dominated by the\nmeridional wind component and synoptic-scale weather\nsystems moving in the Bellingshausen Sea [Turner et al.,\n1995].\n[26] It has been shown that the strength of the circumpolar\nwesterlies has been increasing since the 1970s, especially\nduring the summer, associated with the more positive phase\nof the SAM [Marshall et al., 2006]. The resulting increase\nin northerlies, as the air masses are blocked by the Antarctic\nPeninsula and deflected south, brings warmer and more\nhumid maritime air to Gomez. This has been demonstrated\nin the accumulation record from Gomez which revealed a\nlarge increase in snowfall since the 1970s and a positive\nrelationship between annual accumulation and the SAM\n[Thomas et al., 2008].\n[27] The positive relationship between changing atmo-\nspheric circulation and precipitation will also dominate the\nstable isotope record from this site, which is essentially\nprecipitation dependent. Therefore, we can expect that the\nisotopic composition in the Gomez core will reflect warmer\nD20116 THOMAS AND BRACEGIRDLE: IMPROVING ICE CORE INTERPRETATION\n5 of 8\nD20116\ntemperatures during the positive phase of the SAM as a\nresult of increased northerlies.\n[28] The density of trajectory locations (Figure 2) is of\nparticular interest with respect to the recent warming\ncaptured in instrumental records from the west coast of\nthe peninsula. The majority of the trajectory paths to reach\nGomez pass over a region of strong spatial coherence in\ninterannual winter season temperature variability that was\nidentified by King and Comiso [2003]. This region extends\nalong the coast and adjacent ocean of the western Antarctic\nFigure 4. Five day summer trajectory paths from ERA-40 (1980\u20132001) separated by height (pressure).\nNear-surface (blue), midlevel (green), and high-level (red) air masses.\nFigure 3. Seasonal track densities from ERA-40 (1980\u20132001) shown as a percentage. (top left) austral\nsummer; (top right) autumn; (bottom left) winter; (bottom right) spring.\nD20116 THOMAS AND BRACEGIRDLE: IMPROVING ICE CORE INTERPRETATION\n6 of 8\nD20116\nPeninsula and includes Faraday and Rothera stations. Thus,\nwe might deduce that temperature changes occurring at\nthese stations will be reflected in the Gomez isotope record.\n[29] The track densities for the Dyer Plateau also pass\nover part of this region of strong spatial coherence; how-\never, this site is influenced by both western and eastern\nclimate regimes suggesting that the stable isotope record\nfrom cores drilled here will be a reflection of both. In\naddition fewer trajectories originate from low-level air\nmasses (below 850 hPa) at this site, 75% compared to\n83% at Gomez, suggesting that air parcels may have had a\nsmaller influence from the sea surface over a 5 day\ntimescale. Thus, the west coast signal will be diluted,\npossibly explaining the poor correlation between the stable\nisotope record from the Dyer Plateau ice core and Faraday\ntemperatures [Vaughan et al., 2003].\n[30] Sea ice has been shown to play a major role in\nmodulating climate variability in the west coast of the\nAntarctic Peninsula. Observations of sea ice extent from\nsatellite data are short, and thus, ice core proxies such as\nmethanesulphonic acid (MSA), a derivative of dimethyl\nsulphide emitted by algae during sea ice break up, are\nutilized to reconstruct sea ice extent beyond the satellite\nera [Curran et al., 2003; Abram et al., 2007]. The trajectory\npaths determined from ERA-40 reveal that the preferred\ntransport route during the spring and summer, the period of\nsea ice breakup, is from the north to west Bellingshausen\nSea, suggesting that sea ice proxies from the Gomez core\nwill be representative of changes here. However, during the\nsummer months there is an increase in trajectories from the\neast of the Gomez site (Figure 4), which will result in\ntransport of MSA originating from the Weddell Sea region.\nThus, the interpretation of the MSA and other sea ice\nproxies from the Gomez core must be considered sensitive\nto changes in both the Bellingshausen and Weddell Sea. If\nthe easterly transport during the summer months is sensitive\nto changes in the SAM, then the source of sea salt proxies in\nthe Gomez ice core may not be consistent in time. Further\ninvestigation of the marine aerosols and sea ice proxies\nfrom this core is needed to understand the influence of the\neasterly transport; however, circulation changes of this\nnature should be a consideration when interpreting any\ncoastal ice core.\n4. Conclusions\n[31] The investigation into the subseasonal precipitation\nconfirms that the reanalysis data adequately reproduce the\nprecipitation variability at the Gomez ice core site. Despite\ndifferences in the resolution of the ECMWF model during\nthe operational analysis (2002 to the present) and the ERA-40\nreanalysis (used in this paper from 1980 to 2001) the annual\nvariability captured by the ERA-40 series is close to that of\nthe ice core accumulation record indicating that the lower-\nresolution model is still able to adequately capture\nsubseasonal precipitation variability at the site. Therefore,\nthe air mass trajectories produced by the model for\nprecipitation events (defined as greater than 10 mm) were\nrun backward in time to investigate the dominant climate\nregime affecting the Gomez site and hence the source and\ntransport mechanisms affecting the ice core climate proxies.\n[32] The analyses of the trajectory paths reaching the\nGomez site confirm that precipitation is dominated by the\ncircumpolar winds and subsequently the orographic barrier\nproduced by the Antarctic Peninsula which transports air\nsouth toward the Gomez site. The greatest track densities\noccur over the Bellingshausen Sea, with a small proportion\ncrossing the peninsula from the Weddell Sea during the\nsummer months. These findings indicate that the Gomez ice\ncore has the potential to provide a valuable record of past\nclimate in the Antarctic Peninsula that is dominated by the\ncircumpolar westerlies, making it a valuable proxy for\nFigure 5.

This is of particular importance when\ninterpreting sea salts or proxies for sea ice, which can be\nassumed to be dominated by changes in the west of the\nAntarctic Peninsula, but may also have a contribution from\nthe Weddell Sea.\n[33] Acknowledgments.
