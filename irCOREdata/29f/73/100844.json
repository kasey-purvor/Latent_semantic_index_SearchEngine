We examine this transition by measuring\nthe relative population of excited states in several sd-shell nuclei produced by fragmentation with the number\nof removed nucleons ranging from two to sixteen. The two-nucleon removal is consistent with a non-dissipative\nprocess, whereas the removal of more than five nucleons appears to be mainly statistical.\nDOI: 10.1103\/PhysRevC.73.044605 PACS number(s): 25.60.\u2212t, 25.70.Mn, 27.30.+t\nBeams of exotic nuclei provide a key tool to study\nnuclear structure far from stability. At intermediate energies\n(\u223c100 MeV\/nucleon), exotic beams can be produced via in-\nflight fragmentation, where the nucleus of interest is obtained\nby removing nucleons from an incident primary beam. During\nthis reaction, the population of excited states depends on the\nnumber of nucleons removed. One-nucleon removal reactions\nfrom projectiles at intermediate energies have been shown to\nbe mainly direct processes [1] with the resulting cross sections\nto different excited states sensitive to the quantum numbers of\nthe removed nucleon. Two-nucleon knockout has recently been\nshown to be direct in certain energetically favorable cases [2,3].\nFragmentation of heavy nuclei, however, can be described as\na two-step process commonly called abrasion-ablation [4].\nDuring the abrasion stage the nucleons in the overlap volume\nof projectile and target are scraped off as the ions pass\neach other. In the ablation step the prefragment dissipates\nits excitation energy gained during the abrasion by particle\nemission [5] and the different states of the residues are pop-\nulated statistically with weights determined by the excitation\nenergy of the prefragment. Few-nucleon removal reactions\nlie between these two limiting scenarios of purely direct and\nstatistical production. Discrepancies between observed and\npredicted excited state populations [6\u20138] indicate the presence\nof non-statistical processes in few-nucleon removal reactions.\nIn this article, we present new data on the relative population of\nbound excited states produced in fragmentation reactions and\nshow that several-nucleon removal reactions at intermediate\nenergies can be understood in terms of a smooth transition\nfrom direct to statistical processes.\n\u2217Present address: American Science & Engineering, Inc., 829 Mid-\ndlesex Turnpike, Billerica, Massachusetts 01821, USA.\n\u2020Present address: Laboratoire de Physique Corpusculaire, 6 Boule-\nvard du mare\u00b4chal Juin, 14050 Caen Cedex, France.\n\u2021Present address: RIKEN, Hirosawa 2-1, Wako, Saitama 351-0198,\nJapan.\nIn the experiment, we measured \u03b3 rays in coincidence\nwith fragmentation residues to determine the population of\neach of their bound states. Fragmentation residues were\nobtained from 34Ar, 26Si, 25Al, and 24Mg secondary beams at\n\u223c105 MeV\/nucleon, which in turn were made by fragmen-\ntation of a 150 MeV\/nucleon 36Ar primary beam from the\nCoupled Cyclotron Facility at the National Superconducting\nCyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) at Michigan State University.\nThe 9Be production target was located at the mid-acceptance\ntarget position of the A1900 fragment separator [9]. The exotic\nsecondary beams impinged on a 376 mg\/cm2 9Be secondary\ntarget located at the target position of the high-resolution,\nlarge-acceptance S800 spectrometer [10]. The magnetic\nrigidity of the spectrometer was set to transmit the residues\nof interest and prevent direct beam from entering the focal\nplane. Each incident beam particle was characterized event-\nby-event in a time-of-flight measurement. Reaction residues\nwere identified in the S800 focal plane through measurement\nof the energy loss in the ionization chamber of the spectrometer\nversus the time-of-flight measured between the object point\nand the focal plane. \u03b3 rays from residues produced in bound\nexcited states were detected in coincidence to determine\nthe population of excited states. The secondary target was\nsurrounded by the SeGA array [11] composed of seventeen 32-\nfold segmented, high-purity Germanium detectors positioned\nat 20.8 cm from the center of the target. Seven detectors were\nplaced at forward angles in a 37\u25e6 ring with respect to the\nbeam axis and 10 detectors were located in a 90\u25e6 ring around\nthe target position. The photopeak efficiency of SeGA, in this\nconfiguration, is 2.5% for a 1.3-MeV photon emitted from a\nmoving source with a velocity of v = 0.35c. The Germanium\ndetectors were calibrated in energy with 56Co, 152Eu, and\n226Ra sources. Thirty-six known transitions ranging from 122\nto 3451 keV were used to perform the energy calibration.\nThe response of the detector was simulated with the GEANT\ncode [12] and the simulated detection efficiency validated\nwith calibrated-source measurements. The experimental and\nsimulated efficiencies agree within 2% at 0.85 MeV, within\n1% at 1.3 MeV and the deviation at 3.2 MeV is 4(3)%.\n0556-2813\/2006\/73(4)\/044605(5)\/$23.00 044605-1 \u00a92006 The American Physical Society\nA. OBERTELLI et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 73, 044605 (2006)\nThe highest \u03b3 -ray energy observed in the experiment is\n2.5 MeV. The electromagnetic interaction of photons with\nmatter is very well treated by GEANT within the considered\nenergy range from 100 keV to 3 MeV [13]. The population\nof excited states was determined from the \u03b3 -ray intensities\nrelative to the number of reaction residues. The population\nto the ground state was evaluated by subtraction. More than\n90% of the momentum distribution was transmited for the\nstudied two-nucleon removal reactions. For the other reaction\nchannels, only part of the momentum distribution was within\nthe acceptance of the S800, therefore no absolute cross sections\ncould be measured. In the following, we assume that the\nmomentum acceptance does not affect our conclusions.\nThe fragmentation residues analyzed here were chosen\n(i) to have a separation energy of less than 5 MeV to exclude\npotentially undetected high-energy feeding transitions and to\nthus ensure reliable relative population of individual excited\nstates and (ii) to be experimentally well known and reproduced\nby shell-model calculations. With these criteria, we focused\non the production of the sd-shell nuclei 21Na, 18Ne, and 24Si,\nproduced from different incoming beams.\n21Na (Sp = 2.43 MeV) was produced from fragmentation\nof 24Mg, 25Al, and 34Ar. Its \u03b3 -ray spectrum in coincidence\nwith incoming 24Mg is shown in Fig 1. 21Na presents three\nbound excited states and an unbound state that decays via\nelectromagnetic transitions (\u0002\u03b3 \u0004 \u0002p [14]. The level scheme\nof 21Na is compared to shell-model calculations performed\nwith the code Oxbash [15] and the USD interaction [16] in\nFig. 2. The 7\/2+ excited state decays with 93(2)% [17] to the\n332-keV low-lying level via a 1384-keV transition, whereas\nthe 2424-keV state decays directly to the ground state. The\nproton-unbound 2829-keV level is known to decay via \u03b3\nemission with a 63(5)% branching ratio to the 7\/2+ excited\nstate and with 37(5)% to the 332-keV level. The relative\npopulations of these states in fragmentation of 24Mg and\n34Ar are presented in Fig. 3. The population of the states is\ndetermined from a fit of the GEANT simulation to the data.\nThe energy dependence of the background is well reproduced\nby a double exponential function modeling the shape of the\nbackground at high and low energy.

Statistical uncertainties on the extracted population\nare indicated by error bars in Fig. 3.\nA first comparison of the experimental data indicates that\nthe fragmentation from 34Ar favors the high-spin states 7\/2+\nand 9\/2+ relative to the fragmentation of 24Mg. The theoretical\nlines are discussed later. 18Ne was produced from 24Mg, 25Al,\n26Si, and 34Ar. It has four bound excited states below its\nproton separation energy of Sp = 3922 keV. A 2+ excited\nstate at 1887 keV and a (0+, 2+, 4+) triplet at \u223c3500 keV. The\nmembers of the triplet decay to the first 2+ state. The relative\npopulation of states in 18Ne from the fragmentation of 34Ar\nis presented in Fig. 4. The production of 24Si from 26Si was\nalso studied as an interesting case of two-neutron removal.\nTwo transitions were observed in 24Si [Sp = 3.3(4) keV]\ncorresponding to two excited states previously reported in\nRef. [18]. They were assigned as the first and second 2+ states\nof 24Si at 1860(8) keV and 3410(14) keV, respectively, based\non good agreement with both shell-model calculations and the\nlevel scheme of the mirror nucleus 24Ne.\nIn the following, we present a simple approach to qualita-\ntively reproduce our observations. The main idea is to consider\nthe coexistence of both, statistical feeding of different states\nand a non-dissipative process that depends on the structure\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n+3\/2 +5\/2 +7\/2 +1\/2 +9\/2\ngs 332 keV 1716 keV 2424 keV 2829 keV\nNa)X21Mg,24Be(9\n \n(%\n)\nkP\nsm\nkP\nk\ns+Pk\nsmfit, P\nexpt.\nNa)X21Ar,34Be(9\nsm\nkP\nk\ns+Pk\nsmfit, P\nexpt.\nFIG. 3.

(5)\n(solid line).\nof the projectile and the residue. In a first step, we consider\na statistical population. Assuming a two-step fragmentation\nprocess with a thermalized prefragment and neglecting the\neffect of particle emission on the relative feeding of excited\nstates in the residue, the statistical population P sk of a residue\u2019s\nbound excited state k, with a spin jk and an excitation energy\nE\u2217k , is expected to be proportional to the Boltzmann factor\nweighted by the spin degeneracy [19]\nP sk = N (2jk + 1)e\u2212E\n\u2217\nk \/T , (1)\nwhere N = 1\/(\u2211k P sk ) is for normalization. In this\nparametrization, T is not the usual temperature of the\nprefragment because P sk is an estimation function for the\npopulation of the excited states of the residue. T represents\nan average quantity, including the effects of the temperature\nof the prefragment and the different decay channels of the\nprefragment to the residue. P s favors the population of\nhigh-spin and low-energy states. These statistical predictions\nare plotted for 18Ne in Fig. 4 for T = 1 MeV and T = 3 MeV.\nFor the lower T, the population decays exponentially with the\nexcitation energy E\u2217. At T = 3 MeV \u223cSp = 3.9 MeV, the\npopulation is driven by both the spin degeneracy of the excited\nstates and the exponential decay with E\u2217. Clearly, no value of\nT can reproduce the observations within error bars.\nIn a second step, we consider the population of excited\nstates to be only because of nondissipative processes, such as\ndirect multinucleon removal or sequential stripping reactions.\nTo estimate the relative populations of such mechanisms in a\nsimple picture, we assume (i) that the relative production in\nthese non-dissipative channels depends only on the projectile\nand residue shell-model wave functions and the single-particle\nremoval cross sections and (ii) that the cross sections for\nthe removal of an s-wave and d-wave nucleon from the sd\nshell are identical, as it is qualitatively justified by the single\nparticle cross sections reported in Ref. [2]. We estimated an\neffective multinucleon removal strength between the projectile\nand the residue via shell-model wave functions. In a shell-\nmodel description, the wave function |\u00030\u3009 of the incoming\nparticle with A nucleons is decomposed into its underlying\nindependent-particle shell-model configurations |\u03c6i(A)\u3009 with\nweight coefficients w0i = |\u3008\u03c6i(A)|\u00030\u3009|2. In the same way, the\nwave function |\u0005k\u3009 of the residue, produced in an excited\nstate k from a \u0006A-nucleon removal, is decomposed with the\nweight coefficients \u03b2kj = |\u3008\u03c6j (A \u2212 \u0006A)|\u0005k\u3009|2. The effective\ntransition strengths Ck between the incident particle and the\nresidue in a state k, resulting from the removal of neutrons and\nprotons, is taken as\nCk =\n\u2211\ni\n\u2211\nj\nw0i \u03b2\nk\nj cij , (2)\nwhere cij is the number of ways one can remove \u0006A nucleons\nfrom |\u03c6i(A)\u3009 to obtain |\u03c6j (A \u2212 \u0006A)\u3009. cij is evaluated as\ncij =\n\u220f\n\u03b8\nC\n(\nn\u03b8i (A), n\u03b8j (A \u2212 \u0006A)\n)\n, (3)\nwhere C(n\u03b8i , n\u03b8j ) is the number of combinations of n\u03b8j nucleons\nchoosen from a set of n\u03b8i nucleons and n\u03b8i (A) is the number\nof nucleons of the configuration |\u03c6i(A)\u3009 in the subshell\n\u03b8 \u2261 (\t, j, \u03c4 ), with \t, j , and \u03c4 the angular momentum, total\nangular momentum, and isospin of the considered subshell,\nrespectively. cij is nonzero only if the number of nucleons\nn\u03b8i (A) in each occupied orbital \u03b8 of |\u03c6i(A)\u3009 is greater or equal\nto the corresponding number of nucleons n\u03b8j (A \u2212 \u0006A) in the\nsame orbital of |\u03c6j (A \u2212 \u0006A)\u3009. For simplicity, angular mo-\nmentum couplings are neglected. The shell-model prediction\nP smk for the population of each bound state k is then given by\nP smk =\nCk\u2211\nk Ck\n. (4)\nThe calculation of P smk for a given system is parameter free.\nAll calculations were performed within the sd-shell-model\nspace with the shell-model code Oxbash [15] and the USD\ninteraction [16]. The difference between P smk and a complete\ncalculation is shown in the case of 26Ne produced by the\ntwo-proton knockout from 28Mg [2] in Fig. 5. The stripping\nresults, considering exact two-nucleon amplitudes and reaction\ncross sections, are taken from Ref. [3]. Equation (4) reproduces\nthe trend of the complete calculation, which is in good\nagreement with the data. This two-nucleon removal has been\nshown to be a direct process [2]. Thus a standard direct reaction\nmechanism is expected to predict the experimental feeding\ncorrectly. In this case, the statistical population [from Eq. (1)]\ncannot reproduce the experimental behavior of the relative\npopulation within the experimental uncertainties, especially\nthe strong population of both the ground state and the 4+ state\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n+\n10 +12\n+\n14\n+\n22\nNe)X26Mg,28Be(9\n \n(%\n)\nkP\nexpt.\ngs 2020 keV 3500 keV 3700 keV\nk\nsmP\n, T=1 MeVk\nsP\n, T=4 MeVk\nsP\nknockout\nFIG. 5.

The dependence of P sm on the structure\nof the projectile for a given residue is clearly apparent in the\ncase of 21Na produced from 24Mg and 34Ar (Fig. 3). For a\n34Ar projectile, the population function P sm is flat, whereas it\nshows large differences from state to state for incoming 24Mg.\nNeither the statistical assumption nor the derived equation\n[Eq. (4)] can reproduce the entire data set correctly. This\nis not surprising because the number of removed nucleons\nranges from \u0006A = 2, known to have a dominant direct part in\nthe production mechanism, to \u0006A = 16 expected to be well\ndescribed by a two-step fragmentation statistical calculation.\nFor this reason, we considered the coexistence of the\ntwo phenomena. The relative populations of each of the\nnine aforementioned systems were fitted with a function Pk\ncombining the statistical feeding P sk with the nondissipative\npopulation P smk in the following way\nPk = \u03b1P smk + (1 \u2212 \u03b1)P sk (T ), (5)\nwhere the weight of the single-particle component \u03b1 and\nthe temperature-like parameter T of the statistical part were\nthe only parameters. Both P s and P sm are normalized to\nunity so that\n\u2211\nk Pk = 1. In adding the two probabilities, we\nneglected interferences between the two processes. For the\ntwo-nucleon removal, we considered the complete stripping\nreaction calculation for the direct single-particle function\nP sm. The fitting was performed by minimizing a standard\n\u03c72 function with the following boundary conditions: 0\u0001 \u03b1\u0001 1\nand 0\u0001 T . The results obtained are summarized in Table I. For\neach system, we report the \u03c72 values for the fit with Eq. (5)\n(Pk), for the non-dissipative estimation P smk , and for the fit\nwith the statistical part P sk . The different \u03c72 values are not\nnormalized to the number of degrees of freedom (depending\non the number of parameters in the considered probability law)\nto offer an unbiased evaluation of the agreement of the data set\nand the theoretical assumption. The best fit with Pk for each\nsystem reproduces the data well, as is illustrated by the good\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nT (MeV)\n\u03b1\nFIG. 6. Correlation between the weight \u03b1 of direct process (see\ntext) and the temperature-like parameter T of the statistical part.\n\u03c72 values. For the residue 18Ne, the experimental uncertainties\ncorresponding to the ground state and the first excited state are\nlarger relative to other residues because of the decay scheme\nof 18Ne. Therefore, the fit is less sensitive, resulting in large\nerror bars for the estimation of \u03b1. The fit for the two-proton\nremoval 9Be(28Mg,26Ne)X gives \u03b1 = 0.97(11), in agreement\nwith Ref. [3]. For cases with the residue corresponding\nto \u0006A = 6 \u2212 16, the fit is consistent with \u03b1 = 0, showing\nthat for \u0006A>\u223c 5 statistical population can account for the\nobservations. Even if not strictly monotonic, the decrease of \u03b1\nis clearly correlated with the number of removed nucleons\n\u0006A. The weight \u03b1 of the nondissipative removal and the\ntemperature-like parameter T of the statistical process show\na strong correlation as illustrated in Fig. 6. From the simple\ningredients of the model, the observed correlation can be\nintuitively understood. At T = 0 the population is expected\nto be nonstatistical because P s = 0 except for the ground\nstate, whereas for increasing T, the stastistical feeding should\nbe more dominant. This correlation validates the underlying\nintuitive assumptions of our approach.\nWe have fragmented sd-shell nuclei at intermediate energies\nand measured the relative feeding of excited states of the\nresidues via \u03b3 -ray spectroscopy. Nine multinucleon removal\nreactions from \u0006A = 2 to 16 have been studied. The two-\nnucleon removal is confirmed to be consistent with a nondis-\nsipative, direct mechanism, whereas the removal of more than\nfive nucleons is consistent with a purely statistical process.\nThe results confirm that both a non-dissipative process and\na statistical mechanism participate in multi-nucleon removal\nreactions when 2 < \u0006A < 6 are being removed.\nThe authors acknowledge support from the U.S. Na-\ntional Science Foundation under grants PHY-0110253 and\nPHY-0244453 and the United Kingdom Engineering and\nPhysical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) under grant\nEP\/D003628.
