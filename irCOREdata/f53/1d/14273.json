A specific interest, and the origin\nof the projects' collective name, is in the question of whether and how dialogue can be\nhelpfully 'reused'. What benefits can students gain from dialogue as observers, not just as\nparticipants? We describe our initial attempts to generate and capture educationally\neffective discourse exchanges amongst and between students and tutors. Problems\nencountered with available CMC discourse formats led to our development of a set of\nTask Directed Discussions (TDDs). A medium-sized corpus of discourse exchanges was\ncollected using the TDDs. A selection of nearly two hundred of these TDD exchanges\nformed the multimedia discourse database to the implemented prototype system,\nDissemination. Initial results from a controlled experiment and evaluation of\nDissemination are outlined\nThe vicarious learner projects\nThe research programme on vicarious learning, part of which we report in this paper, has\nbeen aimed at exploring the idea that learning can be facilitated by providing learners with\naccess to the experiences of other learners. We use Bandura's term vicarious learning to\ndescribe this (Bandura, 1986), and we believe it to be a paradigm that offers particular\npromise when seen as an innovative way of exploiting recent technical advances in\nmultimedia and distance learning technologies. It offers the prospect of a real alternative to\nthe building of intelligent tutors (which directly address the problem of allowing learners\naccess to dialogue, but which have proved largely intractable in practice) or to the direct\nsupport of live dialogues (which do not offer a solution to the problem of providing 'live'\ntutors - unless they are between peer learners). In the research reported here our main\nobjectives were to develop techniques to facilitate learners' access to, especially, dialogues\n33\nF. Dineen et al Vicarious learning through capturing task-directed discussions\nand discussions which have arisen when other learners were faced with similar issues or\nproblems in understanding the material. This required us to investigate means of indexing\nand retrieving appropriate dialogues and build on these to create an advanced prototype\nsystem for use in educational settings.\nWhile the role of dialogue in learning has an important place in educational and\ndevelopmental theory our work has been motivated by the conviction that it has been\nunder-emphasized in mainstream approaches to the development of learning technology.\nIn work funded by BT prior to the present project (Mayes, 1995; Fowler and Mayes, 1997),\na framework was described in which types of supporting technology could be mapped onto\nstages of learning. This gave a principled way of distinguishing three kinds of courseware:\nprimary, secondary and tertiary. 'Courseware' is often interpreted to mean the representa-\ntion, explanation and presentation of the subject matter content, as in a textbook. This is\nwhat we term primary courseware, and it encompasses many forms - text, hypertext,\ngraphics, multimedia and most Web material. This maps onto the stage of learning called\nconceptualization. In contrast, secondary courseware comprises tools which learners use to\noperate on this primary material and the products of these operations. These can be\npresentation or concept-mapping tools; they might be shells in which students compose\nmultimedia essays or problem-solving environments. Essentially secondary courseware\nsupports learning by doing and maps onto construction, so called to emphasize\nconstructivist assumptions about the need to situate learning in meaningful, task-based\nactivity. The third sort of courseware, the focus of this project, comprises structures to\nsupport discussion between learners and tutors, and to capture these dialogues in order to\nrender them reusable for the next group of students. We refer to this as tertiary courseware\nand it is intended to provide at least some of the benefits of small-group teaching.\nThe present paper looks at how the value of dialogue in learning depends on the structure\nof the environment in which it takes place. In particular, we consider dialogue which takes\nplace in a CMC environment, an approach which is being adopted in many courses from\nprimary schools through to postgraduate university courses and continuing education,\noften uncritically. The vicarious learner projects have been conducted by a group at the\nauthors' institutions to study issues raised by the creation, use and support of tertiary\ncourseware in such an environment.\nDrawing on our own experience in developing Web-based CBL environments, we describe\nbelow the reasons for developing a multimedia database of discourse exchanges as a means\nto promote better discussions (Greeno, Benke, Engle, Lachapelle and Wiebe, 1998). The\ndevelopment of this multimedia system, which we call the Dissemination system, has been\nmotivated by a wish to exploit technology as a means to promote patterns of discussion\nand enquiry that have proved difficult or problematic to initiate in traditional educational\ncontexts (Bligh, 1986; Gibbs, 1992). We begin by looking at the vicarious learner projects'\ninitial attempts to generate effective educational discourse and consider the various roles of\nthe environment, the participants and the decisions of the course organizers as some of the\ndeterminants of the kind of dialogue that results. These issues underlie the efficacy of\ndialogue in learning, face-to-face as well as online (Newman, Webb and Cochrane, 1995).\n34\nAlt-] Volume 7 Number 3\nAttempts to encourage appropriate pedagogical discourse\nMany researchers have emphasized the fundamental role played by dialogue in all\nconceptual learning, particularly in complex, discursive domains (e.g. Voss, 1996;\nLaurillard, 1993). Nevertheless, in higher education at least, with increasing class sizes and\nthe widespread development of a 'delivery' approach to learning even in conventional\nteaching environments, discussion between a tutor and an individual student is becoming\nquite rare. The danger is that the introduction of new learning technologies will be\nassociated with a confounding reduction in dialogue, and a consequent impoverishment in\nthe quality of understanding achieved. An important challenge for learning technology\nmust be to maintain the benefits of dialogue in the face of pressures which work against\nlearner-tutor contact, this being achieved by opening up new media for discourse that are\nnot subject to the same bottlenecks in delivery and implementation as traditional methods.\nThe vicarious learner projects, then, propose a new type of courseware that aims to\nsupport understanding of primary course content by distilling the experience of other\nlearners captured as discourse. Initial attempts to exploit CMC technologies led us to\ndesign a novel (at that time) Web-based learning environment involving an SGML-based\nintegration of primary and secondary courseware, with the HyperNews system (LaLiberte,\n1995) supporting a discussion component. HyperNews is a tool that manages a collection\nof HTML pages to provide a forum maintaining persistent discussion threads accessible\nthrough a normal Web browser such as Netscape. We taught a module on 'Computers in\nTeaching and Learning' twice to students who were taking a Masters' level course on\nHuman-Computer Interaction. In the first of these (CTL1), the discussion environment\nwas used relatively loosely, students were prompted by a few seed questions, but then were\nleft to develop the discussion as they chose, with arbitrary but usually quite sparse\ncontributions from the course tutors. Thus HyperNews, as used in CTL1, acted as a form\nof 'discretionary database' (Connelly and Thorn, 1991), growing and developing only\nunder the motivation of the students themselves.\nBased on feedback from the first course and suggestions in the literature on conducting\nonline discussions (Sproull and Keisler, 1993), we made the discussions in the second\nrunning of the module (CTL2) more structured, and participation compulsory. We\nrequired tutors to post specific questions and participate more, particularly by\nsummarizing the main points at the end of each week's discussion. These changes, which\nwere appropriately based on the comments and observation of real users in a real setting,\nwere not successful in enhancing the effectiveness of the discussions. Two effects were\nparticularly striking. On the one hand, since it was now compulsory, all students\nparticipated in the discussion in CTL2, whereas in CTL1 only half of the students made\nany contribution, though only half of these again (i.e. a quarter of the class) on a regular\nbasis. On the other hand, the number of questions raised in the HyperNews discussion in a\ngiven week in CTL1 was typically four times greater than in CTL2. A content analysis of\nthese questions showed those generated in CTL1 to have been 'knowledge-based' questions\narising from students' interests and attempts to engage more deeply in the problems\nunderlying the course content (Scardamalia, Bereiter, Brett, Burtis, Calhoun and Smith-\nLea, 1992). That is, they were engaging in discussion on the theoretical assumptions and\nmotivations defining the knowledge domain. In contrast, students in CTL2 all par-\nticipated, but in a generally much more subdued manner, restricting their questions to a\n35\nF. Dineen et al Vicarious learning through capturing task-directed discussions\nmore shallow 'text-based' level (Rosenshine and Chapman, 1990). An important con-\nclusion from these trials was the difficulty of eliciting dialogue which had any of the\ncharacteristics which we judged to be necessary for reuse. These results are discussed in\nfurther detail by Lee, Dineen and McKendree (1998).\nTurning discussions into learning tasks\nIn response to our own experience we have developed a series of Task Directed Discussions\n(TDDs) which encourage students to engage in meaningful structured discussion tasks.\nThe series of tasks gradually require students to engage in deeper thinking about the\ndomain concepts and 'ease students in' to discussions. These TDDs are a first step both\ntoward developing methods which will be useful for any student population and also\ntoward testing and refining our model of educational dialogues.\nIn itself, each TDD is a discrete language activity with a set goal, with all discussions being\nbased upon discursive manipulations of a common set of domain concepts. Altogether\neleven Task Directed Discussions have been proposed ranging in discursive focus from\nsingle concepts to groups of concepts, with varying manipulations of these. Thus, the\ndiscussions vary in their coverage of the knowledge domain, the specificity of discussions\nand the types of epistemic structures that they aim to elicit and make explicit and\nobservable to others. TDDs have been based on the lessons learnt in work on second\nlanguage acquisition, where there is over thirty years of experience in using and embedding\ncomplex cognitive tasks in structured discussion groups (Skehan, 1998).\nFor each discussion task the idea is to focus attention on an explicit and shared set of\nconcepts that have been derived from the primary courseware (i.e. the course content).\nThus the primary courseware remains the target for each discussion task, but the form and\nscope of each discussion is controlled through specified manipulations of these concepts.\nSo, each discussion form is based on a simple cognitive task and acts as an example of\nsecondary courseware. Finally, tertiary courseware is produced as an outcome of these\nTDDs in the form of recorded discussions about the course content. These discussion can\nthen be indexed into a multimedia database to complement the primary courseware. The\neleven Task Directed Discussions are:\n1. Amphibolic TDD: the goal is to examine the multiple interpretations offered by the\nprimary courseware.\n2. Common Denominator TDD: given a concept, name examples of its application.\n3. Comparison TDD: describe the connection between two concepts relative to a given\ncriterion.\n4. Defining Terms TDD: one student attempts to describe a concept well enough for\nanother to guess what this concept is.\n5. Depiction TDD: explore the multiple representational structures, styles or media in\nwhich a concept or argument may be depicted (e.g. charts, text, graphs . . . ) .\n6. Gestalt TDD: the explicit goal is to highlight the underlying assumptions made by\nanother student as part of one of their explanations of a concept or argument using a\ngiven concept.\n7. Hypothetical TDD: Encourage learners to reason to and from precepts, conjecturing to\nand from 'possible worlds'. Examples would be counterfactual arguments.\n36\nAlt-) Volume 7 Number 3\n8. Ranking TDD: rank a given set of concepts in terms of level of importance along a\ngiven dimension.\n9. Reconstruct TDD: have learners reorganize the order and propositional structure of\nsections of the primary courseware to explore the conceptual and functional structure\nimplicit.\n10. Repertory Grid TDD: select three concepts and describe in what way two are similar,\nbut different from the other one along a common dimension (construct).\n11. Scanning TDD: select from a designated section of the primary courseware a specified\nnumber of factors that are the most relevant examples of a given criterion.\nTDDs have a number of goals, but foremost is the presumption that through taking part in\nthem learners are implicitly helped in structuring their understanding and developing their\nknowledge, i.e. that learners are helped in developing their 'epistemic fluency' (Morrison\nand Collins, 1995).\nAs a means to exploring such issues relating to multimedia indexing and modality\npresentation of pedagogical discourse we have developed and implemented an indexed\nmultimedia database of these TDDs in the Dissemination tutoring system. A logical\nrepresentation of the interface structure of Dissemination can be seen in Figure 1, while an\nexample of the actual system is shown in Figure 2.\nFigure I: The Dissemination tutoring\nsystem\n\u2022 mpoJnafcoT\nDissemination: an indexed multimedia database of tertiary\ncourseware\nThe experimental system used a portion of the CTL course material. A self-contained\nsection on Models of Learning with Technology was extracted containing approximately\n14,400 words on 45 Web pages ranging from a few paragraphs to a page and a half in\nlength. In addition, a set of tertiary resources was integrated into the online readings.\nThese consisted of material edited from the over 30 hours of tapes generated face-to-face\nusing the TDDs. This resulted in 108 video clips, 13 audio clips, 43 text transcriptions, and\n27 audio annotated graphics that could be accessed either by clicking on highlighted\nkeywords in the primary text or by searching on keywords or the type of discussion task.\n37\nF. Dineen et at Vicarious learning through capturing task-directed discussions\nUsing Dissemination a study was undertaken in which 37 undergraduate subjects were\nrequired to undergo a 10-hour learning experiment. The subjects' goal was to learn and\nunderstand enough of the primary courseware ('The Role of Computers in Teaching and\nLearning', as in the CTL 1 and 2 courses) to achieve 70 per cent on a post-test about it (the\nsubjects were given a financial reward for achieving this score). Subjects were assigned to one\nof two conditions: those who would have access only to the primary courseware, and those\nwho would have additional access to the Dissemination database of TDD-derived\ndiscussions. There was no requirement on the subjects in the latter condition actually to use\nthis tertiary courseware. The assumption was that subjects would only attempt to retrieve\nthose examples of multimedia discourse from the database that could help them in the\ninterpretation and understanding of the course content. In fact, subjects' own stated com-\nments confirmed that they only made use of this material when they found it useful to do so.\ng file Edit ineia nipt Silw Xtlf\ntenc: Tarttarg Material for\nTertiary Material for reflection\nTfet f f a i i } T ^ ^ ^ ^ h l i\ni h til $ i d 3C V ftf\nOne concept description.\n-a^s Keaii-ieyer: ueimmon imi: Beiiecinon; taj^j,S'erscepe; One tonteptcescrtptlon\ndialogoe for Reflectjon\n\u00ab3: fiwea, yn&r easy oaj if^ s wjaaafi ptttel 6e eocw .\nNetscape: 6 teaming anil learning Tetftnaloqq: Tfte Ffanwrnarte\nFigure 2: A screenshot of the Dissemination tutoring system, shewing the primary courseware (centre),\nthe indexed database ofTDDs for the concept 'reflection'(top left) and tertiary courseware presented\nas a text transcript (bottom left) and digitized video dip (bottom right).\nEach media clip entered in the system could be retrieved along three orthogonal dimensions:\n1.

This is the dimension along which the discourse is captured\nand entered into the database (video, audio, text, graphic).\n38\nAlt-] Volume 7 Number 3\nThe relationship of the primary courseware to the tertiary courseware can be seen in\nFigure 1. In studying the course notes the learner can access Dissemination through an\nindexed set of key concepts highlighted directly (top left), or they can access an archived\nTDD indirectly through a search of the database (bottom left). For each key concept the\nlearner is presented with the indexed set of all TDDs for that key concept in various media\n(top right). In selecting one of these along the three orthogonal dimensions the learner is\nshown the desired piece of tertiary courseware (bottom right).\nTertiary courseware as a vicarious learning resource\nThe results from the experiment are extremely rich in data, providing information on the\ncognitive, affective, linguistic and behavioural impact of the use of tertiary material. We\nhave also conducted a series of structured interviews using repertory grid techniques on the\nRepGrid II programme (Gaines and Shaw, 1993). In addition, we are analysing the\ncomputer logs to look at the media access patterns in relation to the content of the tertiary\nand primary courseware. Some preliminary data that is of interest shows that there are\npatterns of preference and individual differences in subjects' retrieval strategies, and that\nthese preferences for tertiary courseware develop over time.\nfigure 3: Graph\nof comparative\nmean rates of\nmedia use for\neach quarter\nhour.\nMedia Usage Comparisons\n100\n\u20225 80\nI\na>\n60\n20\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19\nTime (15 minutes interval3\n-text\n-video \u2022 audo-graphic\nThe pattern of media use during the course of the experiment can be seen in Figure 3. There\nare a number of surprising patterns suggested by this data. The audio-graphic medium is\nclearly the preferred medium of retrieval for the tertiary courseware. In addition, it was not\nclear why the textual medium was used at all, as these were verbatim transcriptions of the\nconversants' speech (hums and stutters included). One explanation may be to understand\nthese results in terms of the 'grounding' of the discourse available in each medium (Clark\nand Brennan, 1993). Yet the concept of communicational grounding does not adequately\nexplain why subjects would access the same data in different media or would show a\npreference for one medium at one time and another later. This point is clearly highlighted\n39\nF. Dineen et al Vicarious learning through capturing task-directed discussions\nwhen one looks at the data on individual differences. For each individual there were marked\npatterns of preference for one medium over another, though these preferences often\nchanged over time. Additionally, the subjects varied greatly in the volume of material\nbrowsed through compared with the number of clips they viewed or read in their entirety.\nThese data on the mean number of clips viewed in their entirety also pose a problem to be\nexplained. Over the course of a single session individuals were less likely to listen to or\nwatch a clip in its entirety, the decline being gradual from a mean of 2 per quarter hour to\nless than 1, with this pattern being repeated during each session. It may be that this is an\nindication of subjects' improvement in their ability to retrieve the information or that their\ngrowing understanding of the course notes allowed them to confirm their working\nhypotheses more quickly. As the subjects' understanding of the material grows, do they\nsimply get better at retrieving the information they need, or do they need to retrieve less\ninformation?\nIn general, preliminary results of the Dissemination experiment seem complex. There is no\noverall effect of whether an individual learner had access to the tertiary material on the\nlevel of understanding achieved. However, this turns out to be because there are very large\nindividual differences in the way the system is used, and in the learning strategies\nemployed. When we look at individual learners we find clear evidence for a 'vicarious\nlearning' effect. Subjects who have chosen to spend most time observing effective\ndiscussions subsequently structure their own free discussions of the course materials in\nways that resemble what they have observed. Moreover, these subjects then show higher\nlearning gains. It is also the case that subjects who had access to tertiary materials are\nsignificantly more likely to judge the system as representing an important learning\nresource, and as providing an 'enjoyable' learning experience. Interestingly, subjects who\ndid not have access to the tertiary material rate the content as more 'correct'.\nOverall, the most interesting result is that when the students engage in discussions\nthemselves, we find that those who had seen the vicarious resources have been modelling\nthe tasks and language used in them. For instance, in the groups who had access to tertiary\ncourseware, when the discussants ran out of things to say on a topic, they often suggested\ntrying one of the discussion games they had seen in the resources. These subjects also were\nsignificantly faster in returning to an 'on-topic' discussion.\nAs a post-test, subjects participated in a 40-minute, online, synchronous discussion of the\nexperimental course material, using Internet Relay Chat. They were simply told to discuss\nthe course content to clear up anything they did not understand. These discussions were\nsaved for analysis. Exploratory analysis of the discussions, using several dialogue mark-up\nand analysis methods based on sources in the literature (Newman, Webb and Cochrane,\n1995; Henri, 1991; Pilkington, 1996), was undertaken. It showed for the group that were\nallowed access to tertiary materials significant increases (p < 0.05) in the number of\noccurrences of several educationally relevant discourse features. This group:\n\u2022 showed more critical assessment of their own or another person's contribution to\ndiscussion;\n\u2022 exhibited more use of justification - providing proof or examples to ground a\nstatement;\n40\nAJt-J Volume 7 Number 3\n\u2022 more often explicitly derived new information from known facts;\n\u2022 had a tendency to signal recall or exposition of another person's argument or reasoning.\nIt was also noted that there were significant differences in the amount of discussion\ngenerated, averaging 1,075 words for the group with access to tertiary materials and 834\nwords for the others. When scored by a blind rater for the relevance of each statement, the\ntertiary group stayed on topic significantly more than the others (82 per cent against 68 per\ncent). We have here valuable evidence of the power that watching dialogues can have to\ninfluence positively the subsequent behaviour of students in discussions. This influence is\nlikely to have beneficial educational consequences in the longer run, if the dialogues\nwatched are well selected.\nConclusion\nIn striving to exploit and fully understand the nature and interaction between different\ncourseware media, the 'Groundhog Day' model (Mayes, 1995) has provided a strong focus,\nproposing the exploitation of a networked multimedia database of student discussions. In\nview of the importance of such learning opportunities in traditional educational media\n(Bransford, Franks, Vye and Sherwood, 1989; Graddol, 1989), it has been important in our\nwork to overcome the technical, psychological and educational difficulties in developing\nsuch a resource for learners in a CMC environment. Through our early work on promoting\ndiscourse we quickly identified the strategy of developing a set of Task Directed\nDiscussions that would guide students in their interactions with the primary courseware\nand with each other. Having produced a corpus of such discussion tasks (some thirty\nhours) we implemented these as part of a structured online database of tertiary courseware\nfor other learners to exploit.\nThe experiment conducted using the discourse database has produced interesting and\npromising initial results. Using the information from this experiment, and continuing work\nin developing the multimedia database to exploit the emerging SMIL standard\n(Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language) for integrated multimedia frameworks,\nwe hope to implement the full tertiary courseware corpus. As part of this effort, we are\ncurrently subjecting transcripts of the database corpus to a range of linguistic measures,\nfor both content and discourse analysis (Gunawardena, Lowe and Anderson, 1998). Such\nan analysis will be used to develop further the logical database structure of Dissemination\nfor exploitation by researchers interested in the form and properties of pedagogical\ndiscourse and CMC environments.\nAcknowledgements\nThe research reported here was carried out under the EPSRC grants GR\/K72759 and\nGR\/K86930 ('Distributed Learning Dialogues: deriving tertiary courseware', awarded to\nTerry Mayes, John Lee, Keith Stenning and Patrick McAndrew) and ESRC grant\nL127251023 ('The vicarious learner', awarded to Terry Mayes and John Lee).
