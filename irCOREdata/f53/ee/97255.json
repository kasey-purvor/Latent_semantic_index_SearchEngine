Introduction\n.1. The airway surface liquid\nThe airways of the lung are protected from inhaled dust, bac-\neria and other harmful substances by an extremely thin surface\niquid (ASL), normally from 5 to 10\u0002m deep. The ASL consists of\nt least two layers: the upper layer consists of highly viscous and\non-Newtonianmucus, mainly composed of water (approximately\n8%), salt (1%) and glycosylated mucin proteins (1%), secreted by\npecialised cells (for review of recent research of mucin secretion,\nee Davis and Dickey, 2008 and Davis and Lazarowski, in this vol-\nme). The lower layer is a watery lubricating fluid, or \u2018periciliary\niquid\u2019 (PCL). The origin of the PCL is not known, but is hypothe-\n\u2217 Corresponding author at: School of Mathematics, University of Birmingham,\ndgbaston, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK.\nE-mail address: D.J.Smith.2@bham.ac.uk (D.J.

In order to remove harmful material trapped by the mucus,\nhe layer is transportedalong theairways andoutof the lungsby the\nctivity of a dense mat of microscopic cilia, whereupon it is swal-\nowed or expectorated. Typical mucus velocity values observed in\nxperiment are of the order of tens of microns per second, with the\nlearance of ASL beingmodulated over a three-fold range (Knowles\nnd Boucher, 2002). Each mature ciliated cell may have up to 200\nilia, at a density of 6\u20138\u0002m\u22122 (Sleigh et al., 1988). Fig. 1 shows light\nicroscopy and electronmicrograph visualisation of the two-layer\nSL structure with beating cilia in human lung tissue culture and\nn rabbit trachea, respectively. Impairment of MCC is a major con-\nributing factor in cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease (Boucher, 2007),\nnd in addition to conditions such as asthma and chronic obstruc-\nive pulmonary disease (COPD) (Donno et al., 2000; Rogers, 2004,\n005).\nCilia perform an \u2018effective stroke\u2019 in which they beat forwards,\nrobably engagewith themucous layer, and propel it forward.

A reconstruction of the cilia beat cycle is\nepicted in Fig. 2a. The classical model holds that the PCL provides\nlow viscosity environment in which cilia can perform the recov-\nry stroke, while the overlying mucous layer is propelled by the\nenetration of the cilia tips during the effective stroke. Recently it\nas been suggested that a further role of the PCL is to prevent the\ndherence of epithelial mucins with the overlying mucous layer\nKnowles and Boucher, 2002). CF epithelia absorb excessive liquid,\nesulting in a depletion of the PCL, causing a \u2018double hit\u2019: mucous\nayer tethering to epithelial mucins, and impaired ciliary beating.\nxperiments on human tissue cultures suggest that secreted liquid\nreferentially partitions to the mucous layer (Tarran et al., 2001),\nhich may help to preserve efficient cilia\u2013mucus interaction by\nnsuring that the cilia tips engagewith themucous layer. Excessive\nucin secretion by different secretory cell types are likely to be a\najor cause of the airway plugging associated with fatal asthma\nGroneberg et al., 2004).\nThe bifurcating nature of the lungs results in several orders of\nagnitude difference in surface area between the distal airways\nnd the trachea (Matsui et al., 1998). Hence as the ASL is pro-\nelled from the distal airways to the trachea, it becomes deeper,\nith volume absorption by the epithelium likely being important\nn controlling ASL depth.\n.2. The cilia beat cycle and beat frequency\nSanderson and Sleigh (1981) used high-speed cinemicroscopy\nnd scanning electron microscopy to visualise the cilia beat fre-\nuency and beat cycle, cilium\u2013mucus interaction and metachronal\noordination in rabbit tracheal cilia. Example electron micrograph\nections are shown in Fig. 1 and their beat cycle reconstruction in\nig. 2. These data were later used in mathematical modelling of\nCC, as described in Section 2. Cilia were found to penetrate the\nucus to approximately 0.5\u0002m depth. A wide range of cilia beat\nrequencies (CBF)were reported, apparentlymodulated by temper-\nture. Marino and Aiello (1982) subsequently measured the CBF of\numan bronchial cilia as 15.6Hz at 34 \u25e6C, and found that CBF fell\nignificantly as temperature decreased.\nMore recently Chilvers and O\u2019Callaghan (2000) used digital\nideo to visualise the CBF and cilia beat pattern of human nasal\nilia in the absence of mucus. CBF values in the range 11\u201315Hz\nere reported, and it was found that the beat pattern was pla-\nar. This contrasted with observations reported by Sanderson and\nleigh that rabbit tracheal cilia beneath a mucous layer swept\nc\nq\ni\np\n(\nig. 2.

(2003) showed that cilia in patients with primary ciliary\nyskinesia show a variety of dysfunctional beat patterns. These\nncluded: very slow, \u2018flickering\u2019, associated with outer arm and\nnner\/outer arm dynein defects; stiff, low amplitude beating, asso-\niated with isolated inner arm or radial spoke defects; and large\nmplitude circling motion, associated with a microtubule trans-\nosition defect. The \u2018normal beating\u2019 reconstruction of Chilvers et\nl. showed remarkably little difference between the effective and\necovery strokes, also contrasting with the study of Sanderson and\nleigh.\nFor details on the molecular biology of the regulation of CBF,\nee Salathe (2007) and Davis and Lazarowski (in this volume).\necent modelling, described in Section 2.4, suggests that CBF is\nvery important parameter in directly regulating mucus veloc-\nty and hence clearance, and experiments show that ciliary forces\nepend linearly on CBF (Teff et al., 2008). In vitro experiments\nf Maurer et al. (1982) showed that CBF is increased in allergic\nucociliary dysfunction. This perhaps suggests that in such con-\nitions the dysfunction is not caused by changes to CBF, but rather\nhat CBF increase represents an adaptive mechanism. Gheber and\nriel (1998) examined in detail the effect of viscosity, modulated\nsing dextran polymer, on CBF. They observed a reduction from 11\no 12Hz at viscosity 0.001Pa s, to around 3Hz at 2.0 Pa s\u2014with cilia\nxhibiting a remarkable \u2018operating viscosity range\u2019 covering three\nrders of magnitude. Further detailed study of regulators of CBF\nas recently been presented by Winters et al. (2007). For details of\necent experimental measurements of the forces associated with\nilia beating, see Braiman and Priel (in this volume) and also Teff et\nl. (2007, 2008).\nThe beat pattern is asymmetric in time, the recovery stroke\nnd subsequent pause taking several times longer than the effec-\nive stroke (Sanderson and Sleigh, 1981). If airway surface liquid\nehaved as a Newtonian viscous fluid, this time-asymmetry would\not have any fluid dynamic function. The possible role of the time-\nsymmetry in propelling mucus with viscoelasticity or non-linear\nheology is a subject that has yet to be investigated theoretically.\nanderson and Sleigh (1981) observed that as the mucous layer\neepened, the time-asymmetry of the cilia beat decreased, cor-\nesponding to slower cilia movement but engagement of more\nilia. The mechanics of this adaptation have not been investigated\nuantitatively, but we speculate that it would allow the force on\nndividual cilia tobe reduced,while thenumberof cilia contributing\nropulsive force increases, maintainingMCC.

Metachronism\nAn important simplifying featureofmanymathematicalmodels,\ns well as a fertile area for other models to understand the emer-\nence of ismetachronism. A brief review follows; for further details,\nee Braiman and Priel (in this volume). Metachronism is a form of\noordinated activity whereby the movement of a cilium is consis-\nently out of phase with surrounding cilia. Hence the region of cilia\nerforming the effective stroke propagates, usually in the oppo-\nite direction in the case of lung cilia (\u2018antiplectic metachronism\u2019).\nhis is seenmostdramatically in swimmingmicroorganisms,which\nive the appearance of \u2018the wind blowing over a field of corn\u2019. A\nomputer-generated metachronal wave based on analysis of tra-\nheal cilia is given in Fig. 2b.\nDetailed mathematical analysis of metachronism is given in\nheber and Priel (1990). The wave is split into two components,\nne parallel to the effective stroke (the \u2018orthoplectic direction\u2019),\nhe other perpendicular (the \u2018diaplectic direction\u2019). Mathemati-\nal models such as those described in Section 2.2 have typically\nonsidered only the effect of metachronism in the orthoplectic\nirection, assuming synchrony in the diaplectic direction. How-\nver, data have shown (Sanderson and Sleigh, 1981) that activity is\nlso propagated in the diaplectic direction, the angle between the\nffective stroke direction and thewave propagation direction being\npproximately 135\u25e6. Gheber and Priel (1990) derived an expression\nor the metachronal wavelengths in both directions, based on the\nssumption that mechanical contact of cilia causes propagation of\nctivity. Their model gave predictions of the angle of propagation\nnd wavelength, the latter comparing very well with experimen-\nal studies. It was later shown in frog oesophagus cilia (Gheber\nnd Priel, 1998) that increased viscosity causes the metachronal\nave to become relatively more orthoplectic. This modulation was\nnterpreted as being due to a decrease in the relative temporal\nsymmetry between the effective and recovery strokes. The emer-\nence of metachronism has been the subject of extensive detailed\nodelling, reviewed in Section 4.2.\n.4. Airway surface liquid rheology\nMucus is a gel which exhibits complex rheological properties\nuch as shear-thinning, viscoelasticity, spinnability\/cohesiveness\nnd adhesiveness, due to its content of glycosylated mucin poly-\ners (Puchelle et al., 1987). A detailed review of the composition,\ntructure and rheology of mucus may be found in Sleigh et al.\n1988), and concise recent reviews ofmucus rheology can be found\nnMajima (2002), King (2004), Bush et al. (2006) and Rubin (2007).\nue to varying strain rates, rheology throughout the volume of the\nucusmay be non-uniformwith, for instance, lower viscosity near\nhe zone of ciliary penetration due to shear-thinning. Rheology also\naries along the respiratory tree (App et al., 1993). PCL has gener-\nlly been considered as a watery \u2018Newtonian fluid\u2019 that does not\nxhibit elasticity or other complex properties, but this has recently\neen challenged (Boucher, 2007).\nMedical research typically has focusedonviscosity,whichquan-\nifies fluid-like \u2018thickness\u2019, elasticity which quantifies solid-like\nnergy storage, spinnability, which quantifies the ability of mucus\no be drawn into a thread, and also surface tension. Verdugo\n1990) discusses how rheology is regulated by hydration, and\now altered ionic composition of the ASL, characteristic of that\nbserved in CF, can result in poor swelling of secreted mucin gran-\nles, and hence excessive viscosity. Feng et al. (1999) showed that\ndding dextran to mucus reduced viscoelasticity, while increasing\nCC.\nl\nq\nw\ntNeurobiology 163 (2008) 178\u2013188\nRecentworkhas suggested that, in contrastwith the classic view\nf CF being a disease caused by highly viscous mucus, abnormal\nheology may not be the primary cause of the associated illness.\ntudies have shown that altered biophysical properties of mucus,\nnd possibly MCC dysfunction itself, are secondary to infection in\noth CF and PCD lung disease (McShane et al., 2004; Grubb et al.,\n004; Bush et al., 2006). Viscoelasticity has recently been shown to\nean important factor in the formationofbacterial colonies (Matsui\nt al., 2006).\nTheoreticalmodels have generally consideredmucus to beNew-\nonian, neglecting all properties but its viscosity, or alternatively\nave considered it as a viscoelastic liquid, including energy storage\nffects. The most complex model so far considered in the literature\nsanon-linearMaxwellupper convectedviscoelastic liquid (Mitran,\n007b). The recent study of Dillon et al. (2007) takes a slightly dif-\nerent approach, modelling mucus as being an immersed elastic\network. The relative importance of viscosity and elasticity is mea-\nured by the ratio of elastic (storage) and viscous (loss) moduli,\n\u2032\/G\u2032\u2032. Microrheometry data have shown (see, for example, Wolf et\nl., 1977) that this ratio is close to 1 for tracheal mucus, implying\nhat both viscosity and elasticity are important, although relating\nxperimental measurements to specific biological systems is not\necessarily straightforward.\n. Theoretical models of mucociliary clearance\n.1. Motivation for modelling\nWhile numerous physiological and pathophysiological factors\nre known to influence MCC and associated diseases, there are\nften insufficient data to evaluate each of their effects on MCC\nDonno et al., 2000),motivating experimental and theoreticalmod-\nlling studies. Models have been concerned with predicting such\neatures as: the flowprofile across the ASL depth, averaged over the\neat cycle duration; the effect of altered rheology, CBF, cilia\u2013mucus\nenetration and other parameters on mean flow; instantaneous\now profiles; the relation between fluid flow and the transport of\nuorescently labelled tracer; and the emergence of metachronism.\nStudies concerned with the flow velocity profile (see, for exam-\nle, Fulford and Blake, 1986b) generally predicted small PCL\nransport in comparison to mucous transport. The ciliated culture\ntudy by the Chapel Hill Virtual Lung group (Matsui et al., 1998)\ned the present authors to re-evaluate these models. A schematic\niagram is given in Fig. 3. The cultures, which exhibited rotational\nransport of mucus, were labelled so that fluorescent \u2018columns\u2019 of\nurface liquidextended throughboth themucous layer andPCL. The\nabelled regions moved at approximately equal speed in both lay-\nrs, suggesting approximately equal transport of both mucus and\nCL (Fig. 3a). This was in contrast to previous theoretical predic-\nions of very small PCL fluid transport (Fig. 3c), or indeed the flow\nrofile that would be expected from frictional coupling of mucus\nnd PCL alone (Fig. 3b).\nThe issue of liquid absorption by the epithelium was of great\nnterest, since therewere two conflicting theories of the normal ion\nermeability of the epithelium: does it absorb liquid \u2013 as would be\nequired to maintain PCL height if the liquid is significantly trans-\norted through the converging geometry of the respiratory tree, or\ns it impermeable \u2013 which allows hypotonic conditions to bemain-\nained in the ASL? The resolution of this question had significant\nmplications for the pathogenesis of CF lung disease.A series of studies by the Virtual Lung group have firmly estab-\nished the absorptive role of the epithelium. However, important\nuestions remain: what is the normal level of PCL transport, and\nhat are the physical effects governing MCC? In the following sec-\nionswe discuss recent progress in understanding the nature of the\nD.J. Smith et al. \/ Respiratory Physiology & Neurobiology 163 (2008) 178\u2013188 181\nF nal tr\nl w.

Review of mucociliary modelling\nBarton and Raynor (1967) developed amathematical analysis of\niliary propulsion, approximating the cilium by a rigid rod which\nutomatically shortensduring the recovery stroke. Theyuseda sim-\nlified \u2018resistance coefficient\u2019 approximation to the effect of the\nilium on the surrounding fluid, and theirmodel of the ciliamotion\nid not include the experimental findings thatwere to emerge later.\nheirworkwasa forerunnerof later \u2018cilia sublayer\u2019models, and they\nalculated realistic flow rates. Their characterisation of the cilium\ns a rigid rod was exploited in the models of Smith et al. (2007c)\nnd Blake and Winet (1980).\nThe model of Ross (1971) took into account the non-Newtonian\nature of the upper mucous layer. Rather thanmodelling the effect\nf individual cilia, the mucous layer was propelled by a moving\nwavy wall\u2019 representing the cilia tips, and the flow in the PCL was\not considered.Mucuswasmodelled as a non-linearMaxwell fluid,\nhich takes into account viscoelasticity. The resulting system of\nquationswas solvedanalytically.Mucusflowrateswere calculated\nhich were in rough agreement with experimental data, although\nhere are difficulties with the application of wavy-wall modelling\no antiplectic cilia motion (Blake, 1972). Nevertheless, modelling of\non-linear viscoelasticity represented a significant achievement.\nAnother important aspect of the study of Ross was the estima-\nion of the capillary number associated withmucociliary flow. This\nalculation gave an early indication that surface tension effectsmay\ne important in governing ASL transport. Analyses which explicitly\nake into account both surface tension and ciliary transport haveyet\no be developed, although the phenomenological model described\nn Section 2.4 suggests that surface tension may have important\nffects on mucus\u2013cilia coupling.\na\ne\nt\neansport ofmucus, as indicated by the arrows. TheASLwas labelledwith fluorescein-\nse columnswere transported at equal rates in both PCL andmucus. The lower panel\nprofiles are shown: (a) nearly equal transport of PCL and mucus, (b) PCL transport\neglected and (c) relatively small PCL transport predicted by theoretical models.\nAn alternative \u2018discrete sublayer\u2019 approach exploiting themath-\nmatical technique of slender body theory was developed by Blake\n1972), initially for ciliated microorganisms. Due to their slen-\nerness, individual cilia can be modelled by distributing force\ningularities along their centrelines. These ideas were extended in\ntudies such as Liron and Mochon (1976) and Fulford and Blake\n1986b). A detailed review of such models is given in Smith et\nl. (2007a). Such models have only been applied directly to a one\nr two-layer Newtonian ASL (Blake, 1973, 1975, 1984; Fulford and\nlake, 1986b). The recentmodel of Smith et al. (2007a) calculates an\nnstantaneous three-dimensional flow field in the PCL, but does so\ny taking account of viscoelastic flow in themucous layer indirectly,\nsing a separate phenomenological model.\nMathematically, all of these studies involved representing the\now field by integrals of \u2018point-force\u2019 solutions of the zero-inertia\ntokes flow equations. By employing such solutions for flownear to\ncell surface (Blake, 1971), or flow due to a slender body near to or\nndeed straddling a fluid\u2013fluid interface (Fulford and Blake, 1986b),\ntwas possible to calculate approximate time-averaged force distri-\nutions on the cilia, and hence time-averaged flow profiles. Certain\nimplifying assumptions must be made in addition to the assump-\nion of Newtonian rheology: the interaction of the cilium with the\nime-averaged flow only was calculated, and the interface and sur-\nace was assumed not to be subject to surface tension to leading\nrder. Nevertheless, these studies provided considerable insight:\nt was predicted that the probable quantity of PCL clearance ver-\nus mucous clearance was very low, and that mucous transport\noes not require cilia penetration into the mucous layer, but rather\nn situations of high ciliary inactivity, penetration is essential for\ndequate mucous transport.\nKeller (1975) developed a phenomenological approach to mod-\nlling the sublayer (PCL) in microorganism swimming, referred\no as a \u2018traction layer\u2019 model. The action of the cilia was mod-\nlled as a spatially continuous volume force. This technique was\n182 D.J.

Blake andWinet (1980) applied the traction layer approach\no mucociliary transport in the lung, using the idealised beat pat-\nern of Barton and Raynor (1967). They considered both the PCL\nnd the mucous layers, but modelled mucus as a Newtonian fluid,\nalculating time-averaged flow only. Cilia sublayer resistance was\nodelled as an \u2018active porousmedium\u2019, building on anearlier paper\nBlake, 1977). Their results suggested that slight penetration into\nhe mucous layer by the cilia substantially enhanced transport.\nhey also predicted that mean PCL transport would be very small.\nhe ideas of Blake andWinet (1980) proved a starting point for our\necent phenomenological model, described below.\nLiron and Rozenson (1983) modelled mucus\u2013cilia interaction\nn a simplified manner, in order to take account of non-Newtonian\nffects. Mucus was represented by the linearised Oldroyd B model,\nalid for small rates of shear. It was assumed that the only forces\nriving the fluids were a constant pressure gradient and a series\nf impulses, represented by Dirac delta functions, produced by\nhe cilium tips. After solving the resulting equations by Fourier\nransforms they concluded that penetration was necessary for\nransport. Their approach did not however take into account the\nffect of cilia movement or viscous resistance in the PCL (Fulford\nnd Blake, 1986b). King et al. (1993) formulated a simple analytical\nodel of the mucociliary system, designed to test the effect of\nucus viscoelasticity. While their model was based on certain\nestrictive assumptions, such as zero mean PCL transport, they\nere able to give insight into the effect of viscoelasticity: it was\nredited that clearance increases as elastic modulus decreases.\n.3. Types of model\nThere is a hierarchy of fluid dynamicalmodels of different levels\nf complexity. We shall be concerned only with \u2018sublayer\u2019 models\nhichconsiderboth thePCLandmucous layer, not leastbecause the\now in the PCL is of interest.Wedistinguish the following types: (1)\nolume force,which arephenomenologicalmodels representing the\nilia with a spatially continuous force distribution, varying in time\ns the cilia beat. Examples are Keller (1975), Blake andWinet (1980)\nnd Smith et al. (2007c). (2)Discrete-cilia, more precisemathemati-\nalmodels representing the cilia as discrete entities. A schematic of\nhemodelling set-up is shown in Fig. 4. Examples are themodels of\nlake (1972, 1973) and Fulford and Blake (1986b) described above.\nor detailed review, see Sleigh et al. (1988). A discrete-cilia model\nas developed for the case of a single layer fluid to remove the need\ni\nfi\na\ns\ntNeurobiology 163 (2008) 178\u2013188\nor time-averaging by Liron and Mochon (1976). This was further\neveloped by Smith et al. (2007a) to obtain three-dimensional flow\natterns in the PCL.\nVolume force models are generally used to include physical\nffects that are difficult to take into account in amore precisemath-\nmatical model. However, such models are clearly limited in the\nespect that a number of simplifying approximationsmust bemade\nn their formulation. Discrete-cilia models are more mathemati-\nally rigorous, however the time-dependent modelling has proved\nifficult to extend to the two-layermucociliary system in anymore\nhan a \u2018tactical\u2019 way (Smith et al., 2007a). Time-independent mod-\nlling of, for example, Fulford and Blake (1986b) is limited in that\nt considers the effect of the cilia only through their interaction\nith the time-averaged velocity field, however for twodecades this\norkwasdistinguishedas theonlymodel of discrete slenderbodies\nnteracting with a two-layer fluid.\nDiscrete-cilia models can be further subdivided: (1) Prescribed\neating, in which the cilia motion is input to the model, as\nn the work referenced above. (2) Coupled internal mechanics\/\nuid\u2013structure interaction, in which the cilia motion emerges from\nhe coupling of a specification of the internal axoneme mechan-\ncs and cilium elasticity, and the external viscous forces due to\nhe cilia moving in the fluid. The slender body theory analyses of\nueron, Liron and Levit-Gurevich have modelled the emergence of\netachronism of cilia beating in a homogeneous Newtonian liq-\nid. The studies of Brokaw (2002), Brokaw (2005) and Lindemann\n2004) were concerned with the complex relationship between\nnternal control of dynein activity and waveform, also for cilia and\nagella in homogeneous Newtonian liquids, using relatively sim-\nle fluid dynamic modelling. Recently computational models have\neenapplied to theASL, using the immersedboundarymethod, and\nnite volume\/finite element solvers. These are discussed in more\netail in Section 4.2.\nFurther refinements can be considered: does the model con-\nider a single Newtonian liquid, two liquids of different viscosity,\nimple non-Newtonian properties, or more complex rheology? In\nhe case of coupled internal mechanics\/fluid models, the internal\nechanics may be specified in a very simple manner, for exam-\nle, curvature control, or instead a discrete internal structure may\ne considered. The mucus\u2013PCL interface must also be considered:\nhis is only tracked \u2018explicitly\u2019 as a coupled part of the calculation by\nery recent computationalmodels. Finally, we distinguish between\nodels which are two-dimensional (Smith et al., 2007c; Dillon et\nl., 2007), three-dimensional but which lead to two-dimensional\nesults only (Fulford and Blake, 1986b), three-dimensional in the\near-field and two-dimensional in the far-field (Smith et al., 2007a),\nr fully three-dimensional (Mitran, 2007b). The specific choice has\nargely been dictated by computational cost, but the latter study\nhows that fully three-dimensional simulation is now possible.\nAs models increase in complexity, there are great technical\nhallenges to be overcome in order to extract solutions or useful\nnformation. For this reason, simple phenomenological models are\ntill useful in order to gain important insights, as discussed in the\nollowing section.\n.4. Phenomenological modelling\nThe mucociliary system is challenging to model without pur-\nuing state-of-the-art computational techniques. The discrete-cilia\npproach described above employs slender body theory, avoid-\nng the high computational complexity of immersed boundary or\nnite volume\/finite element methods. This enables computation-\nlly inexpensive calculation of three-dimensional, time-dependent\nolutions. However, the mucociliary system has a number of fea-\nures that make its application problematic.\nlogy & Neurobiology 163 (2008) 178\u2013188 183\np\na\ns\no\nL\no\na\nb\nN\ns\na\nd\na\nw\nt\nS\nc\na\nt\nm\nT\ni\nm\nt\nt\nc\nt\nc\nl\na\na\nS\nf\nl\nh\n(\ns\nt\nl\nw\nFig. 5.

Smith et al. \/ Respiratory Physio\nSlender body theory is typically used in situations where cilia\nroject from an approximately flat surface, with no other bound-\nries or fluid interfaces nearby. In such situations, it can be used in a\ntraightforwardmanner: see, for example, thework of Blake (1972)\nn microorganism swimming, the coupled cilia\/fluid modelling of\niron, Gueron and Levit-Gurevich reviewed below, and the embry-\nnic cilia modelling of Smith et al. (2007a). However, as discussed\nbove, the mucociliary system presents the complication that cilia\neat in a low viscosity layer with an overlying high viscosity non-\newtonian layer. Slender body theory is not strictly valid in such a\nystem. Assuming \u2018deep\u2019 penetration into themucous layer, Fulford\nnd Blake (1986a) derived a slender body theory for a cilium strad-\nling a two-fluid interface, however it was necessary to make the\nssumption the overlying layerwas Newtonian and surface tension\nas assumed to be a subleading effect. As shown by Ross (1971)\nhis may be a dominant effect in the absence of airway surfactants.\nlender body models also lose accuracy in the situation that the\nilia are very closely spaced (Smith et al., 2007a).\nFor these reasons, we pursued a phenomenological modelling\npproach, taking into account the most important features of\nhe cilia propulsion, sublayer \u2018active porous medium\u2019 resistance,\netachronism, and a simplemodel of mucous layer viscoelasticity.\nhe SEM data of Sanderson and Sleigh (1981) showed that, even\nn samples in which the epithelium was far from being flat, the\nucous layer surface and interface did not show large deforma-\nions. An initial model (Smith, 2006) assumed negligible surface\nension. With scaling arguments, this assumption led to the con-\nlusion that the internal pressure of the liquid layer is constant\nhroughout the metachronal wave. This model predicted signifi-\nant vertical components to the fluid motion, causing sufficiently\narge oscillations in the layers to invalidate the model. The model\nlso predicted that for low viscosity mucus, propulsion was almost\nbolished.\nConsequently, we developed a refined model (Smith, 2006;\nmith et al., 2007c), which was based on the assumption that sur-\nace and interface tension effects were sufficiently strong that the\nayer could be assumed flat at all times. Mucus elasticity may also\nave an important role, as shown by the results of Dillon et al.\n2007) discussed in Section 4.2. The assumption of a flat surface is\nupported by calculations of the capillary number associated with\nhe ASL, which shows that surface tension effects are several times\narger in magnitude than viscous effects.

By reintroducing surface tension, horizontal\nressure gradients in themucus and PCLwere restored. These pres-\nure gradients enforce conservation of mass while the layer height\nemains constant. In the absence of the pressure gradient, calcu-\nations predict that there is a positive horizontal velocity gradient\no the left of the effective stroke and a negative horizontal velocity\nradient to the right. By conservation of mass, this leads to down-\nard flow to the left of the effective stroke and upward flow to the\night of the effective stroke. The large downward and upward flow\nach side of the effective stroke would change the layer heights by\nn unphysical amount.\nFluid pressure is lower to the left of the effective stroke than to\nhe right, causing a backflow near the epithelium during the effec-\nive stroke, as shown in Fig. 6a. This also results in a steady forwards\now of mucus during the recovery stroke, despite the fact that the\nilia aredraggingfluidbackwards in thePCL.

An alternate perspective is that the flat interface may\ne brought about by mucus elasticity, as shown by the immersed\noundary simulation results of Dillon et al. (2007).\n.

Tracer transport modelling\nTo investigate which time-averaged flow profiles could result in\nhe observed equal transport of tracer in both mucus and PCL, the\nresent authors (Smith et al., 2007b) formulated and solved a two-\nimensional advection\u2013diffusionmodel of the transport of a tracer,\nith steady and oscillatory profiles calculated with the volume-\norce modelling described above. This model took into account\nhe three main effects governing tracer transport: time-averaged\ndvection, due to the mean flow, unsteady advection, due to cilia-\nriven oscillations, and diffusion across the thin layer, which is\nnhanced by the shearing associated with the flow profile.\nSimulationswith a steadyflowprofilewith very small PCL trans-\nort do not result in equal transport between the layers, as shown\nn the example results given in Fig. 7a and b. However, once phys-\ncally reasonable oscillations in the ASL are taken into account, as\nhown in Fig. 6, the advection\u2013diffusion model predicts very sim-\nlar transport of tracer in the two compartments, differing by only\n8% (Fig. 7c and d) despite the fact that the time-averaged transport\nf liquid in the PCL is relatively very small. When fluid transport in\nhe upper part of the PCL, due to the cilia bending down below the\nnterface during the recovery stroke,was included in themodel, the\nredicted difference in tracer transport was reduced to 9%. Hence\nery low PCL transport, predicted by the mechanical model on the\nasis that the cilia resist fluid flow like a porous medium, is not\ns\no\ne\nt\ni\nig. 7.

It\ns nevertheless possible that taking into account osmotic fluxes, or\ny modelling the PCL and mucous layers in a more sophisticated\nanner, conclusions regarding mean PCL fluid transport may be\nifferent.\n.2. Robustness of the mucociliary system\nThe phenomenological model of Smith et al. (2007c) described\nbove predicted that provided that the flat interface and surface\nere maintained, clearance is not significantly reduced by any\nariations in mucus viscosity, elasticity or layer height. The only\narameter that did have a significant effect was CBF \u2013 reducing\nhis caused an approximately proportional decrease in transport\npeed. This finding paralleled experimental findings regarding \u2013\ndrenergic blockers and agonists. It remains to determine the\nechanics of how MCC is reduced by allergic challenge, in view\nf the data (Maurer et al., 1982) that CBF increases in such condi-\nions.\n\u2018Watery mucus\u2019 having similar properties to the PCL, was pre-\nicted to be transported around 50% faster than \u2018normal mucus\u2019,\nrovided that a flat interface wasmaintained between the two lay-\nrs. It was suggested that this may be the mechanism for the large\nncrease inASL transport observed in pseudohypoaldosteronism\u2014a\nondition in which liquid absorption by the epithelium is greatly\nmpaired.\nHence this phenomenological model provides evidence that\nressure gradientsmay ensure robustness ofMCC to changing con-\nitions, such as the changes that occur along the airway as the ASL\neepens, and in disease states which are not sufficiently severe as\no disrupt the normal ASL structure. A limitation of this work isystem these parameters will be modulated by mechanical and\nther effects, including viscosity (Gheber and Priel, 1998), the pres-\nnce of the mucous layer (Matsui et al., 1998), shear stress due\no breathing (see Button and Boucher, in this volume) and cough-\nng.\nnditions and transport after 20 s of steady advection with lowmean PCL fluid flow,\ner 20 s of advection with low mean PCL fluid flow, combined with the oscillations\nD.J.

A schematic of four distinct mechanisms bywhich cilia propel the ASL. (a) Th\nuring the effective stroke than the recovery stroke. (b) The cell surface causes a \u2018w\ns much fluid backwards. (c) The cilium interacts with the high viscosity mucous la\natness of the interface and surface cause a pressure gradient which increases the f\n. Overview and future directions\n.1. Cilia transport mechanisms\nBlake (2001) summarised the mechanisms by which cilia can\nransport liquid, which we illustrate in Fig. 8a\u2013c and briefly review\nelow. For water-propelling cilia, there are: (1) The orientation\nffect\u2014a slender body having a predominant motion normal to its\nentrelinewill exert almost twice the force as for a tangentialmode\nf motion at the same velocity. In cilia this is exploited by the body\nerforming a motion which is approximately normal to the fluid\nuring the effective stroke, and is relativelymore tangential during\nhe recovery stroke. (2) Thewall effect\u2014the interaction of the cilium\nith the ASL is \u2018shielded\u2019, reducing the force applied, by a greater\negree during the recovery stroke than the effective stroke. For cilia\nn the lung, there is additionally (3) The viscosity effect\u2014by which\nilia interact with high viscosity mucus only during the effective\ntroke, increasing the force associatedwith the propulsive action. A\nrinciple finding of themodel of Fulford andBlake (1986b)was that\n. . .in the mucous layer the extremely high viscosity requires only\nsmall number of cilia per wavelength to penetrate the mucous\nayer to propel the mucus at near the tip speed of the cilia.\u2019\nSincemucus-propelling cilia are relatively short comparedwith\nater-propelling cilia, and there is hence less shape and height\nsymmetry between effective and recovery strokes, this led to\nhe assumption in the phenomenological model of Smith et al.\n2007c) that the viscosity effect was the primary mechanism by\nhich transport is produced. As discussed above, introducing pres-\nure gradients associated with a flat interface and surface of the\nwo-layer system, led to efficient transport even when the viscos-\nty of the mucous layer was reduced. Hence a fourth mechanism\ny which cilia can produce effective transport was suggested: (4)\nhe pressure gradient effect\u2014themucous layer interface and surface\nemain relatively flat, despite the cilia movement. Associated pres-\nure gradients occur which are negative during the effective stroke\nnd positive during the recovery stroke. This amplifies the forces\nxerted by the ciliumon the liquid, resulting in increased transport,\ns illustrated in Fig. 8d.\nThis latter effect may be tested using the modelling framework\nresented by Dillon et al. (2007). Osmotic pressure gradients may\ne present in the ASL, due to the movement of ions and associated\novement ofwater across the epithelial cellmembrane. Such pres-\nure gradients are likely to affect cilia\u2013fluid forces and hence ASL\nelocity in a similar way, and may act over larger distances than\nhose associated with the metachronal wavelength (30\u0002m)..2. Fluid\u2013structure interaction modelling\nTo understand how cilia beating and fluid transport emerge\ns consequences of fluid mechanics, rheology and the internal\na\nfl\nt\no\nsge from parallel to perpendicular orientation results in a higher force being applied\nfect\u2019 so that the recovery stroke, performed close to the cell surface, does not drag\nly during the effective stroke, which causes an increased propulsive force. (d) The\non the cilium, amplifying the propulsive effect.\nechanics of the cilia, it is necessary to solve a \u2018fluid\u2013structure\nnteraction\u2019 problem. Early pioneering studies using a simplified\norm of slender body theory, together with increasingly detailed\nodels of internal axoneme activity, included Machin (1958),\nrokaw (1972) and Hines and Blum (1978). A more accurate model\nf the fluid mechanics was introduced by Gueron and Liron (1992),\nhich allowed the modelling of lines of beating cilia, immersed in\nhomogeneous Newtonian liquid, their bases attached to a solid\nurface. A series of publications followed exploring the energetic\ndvantages ofmetachronal coordination, adaptations inCBF tofluid\niscosity, the movement of energy substrate along cilia from the\nell, and modelling of three-dimensional bending and cilium tor-\nion (Gueron and Liron, 1993, 1998; Gueron and Levit-Gurevich,\n999, 2001) Other detailed modelling of the axoneme and associ-\nted computer simulation were presented recently by Lindemann\n2004) andBrokaw (2002, 2005), the latter paper investigating how\nmbryonic nodal cilia establish \u2018whirling\u2019 motility by considering\nnternal asymmetry of the microtubule system. Nevertheless, as\niscussed above the mucociliary system has features that make\nurther generalisation of this modelling problematic.\nVery recently two important studies have appeared which have\npplied sophisticated computational techniques to the problem,\nhich promise to allow simulation of the mucociliary system with\nonsiderable flexibility regarding internal cilium mechanics and\nucus rheology. Dillon et al. (2007) used the immersed bound-\nry method to simulate two-dimensional flow due to three cilia,\nith a discrete model of the internal elastic and force-generating\ntructures of the cilia. The mucous layer was simulated using a rel-\ntively thin elastic layer immersed in the fluid, a short distance\nbove the cilia tips. Their initial results showed that elastic prop-\nrties of the mucous layer could prevent unphysical deformation\nf the mucus\u2013PCL interface discussed above. Hence considering\nhe mucous layer as an elastic solid, rather than a viscoelas-\nic liquid with surface tension the dominant effect, also led to\nhysically reasonable results (Fig. 9). Moreover, the cilia were\nble to propel marker particles without the need to engage with\nhe mucous layer, as observed experimentally by Winet (1987).\nhile this study considered a small number of cilia and two-\nimensional flow, the framework provides a promising avenue for\nuture research.\nMitran (2007b) recently presented impressive initial computa-\nions, using the finite element method for the simulation of the\nicrotubule internal structures of multiple cilia, and the finite-\nolumemethod for the fluid flow equations. The PCLwasmodelled\ns Newtonian, the mucous layer as an upper-convected Maxwell\nuid. This approach allowed for the first time the simulation of\nhree-dimensional flow due to a line of 256 cilia, with simulation\nf internal mechanics. Metachronism was found to emerge in the\nimulated system. Unpublished data (Mitran, 2007a) describe the\n186 D.J.

Limitations of current models\nThere remain a number of areas where presently published\nodels are limited, as well as a significant number of questions\negarding MCC that have not yet been addressed. While the recent\nhenomenological modelling of Smith et al. (2007c) has provided\nome insights, important questions remain. It is unclear whether\nilia actually resist theflowof liquid in the samemanner as aporous\nedium. It is also difficult to extend the framework to take into\nccount more complex fluid rheology. Finally, the \u2018volume force\u2019\nodel of the cilia action does not allow for analysis of subtle inter-\nctionbetween thefluidand the cilia beat generation.Nevertheless,\nhis study suggests a number of insights regarding the effects of\nheology, surface tension and transport of fluorescent tracer that\nay prove useful for future study. Slender body models such as\nhat of Fulford and Blake (1986b) have also proved very successful,\nut as discussed above, have certain limitations when applied to\nhe two-layer mucociliary system.\nThecomputational frameworksdescribed inSection4.2promise\no provide a platform to test all of the predictions of previous\nodels, in addition to including detailed specification of fluid rhe-\nlogy and cilium internal mechanics. An important question to\nddress is how precisely the interface and surface boundary condi-\nionswill bemodelled. This requires both empirical measurements\nf properties such as surface tension, and additionally decisions\negarding the modelling of a Newtonian\/viscoelastic interface. The\natest generation of models that include cilium internal mechan-\ncs do not yet have a definitive specification for how dynein arms\nnitiate or propagate bending. Lindemann (2004) describes in\netail the \u2018geometric clutch\u2019 hypothesis for the control of flagellar\nending by dynein activity, showing computed beat patterns cal-\nulated with a simple model of the fluid flow and fluid\u2013structure\nnteraction. Brokaw (2002, 2005) give simulation results show-\nng three-dimensional beating due to curvature-controlled dynein\nctivity, and sliding-velocity controlled dynein activity, respec-\nively. The former analysiswas concernedwith flagellarmovement,\nut the internal mechanics considered transfer directly to the\novement of cilia.\na\no\n(\nO\nmcilia beating and transport of an immersed elastic mucous layer. Reproduced with\nPerhaps the most difficult limitation to overcome is the fact\nhat all present models are based on continuum mechanics. Non-\nontinuum effects, for example, nano-scale interactions between\nhe cilium tip and mucus polymer molecules (Blake, 2001), which\nave been speculated to be an important feature of cilia\u2013mucus\noupling, cannot be explicitly included within a continuum frame-\nork. Modelling such interaction presents a significant challenge.\n.4. Future work\nFuture work may develop through the refinement of existing\nodels by including increasingly more accurate rheology, fluid\nechanics andcilium internalmechanics. Thiswill involve the inte-\nration of more accurate biological data with the new generation\nf computational models.\nAn example problem is determining the possible role of PCL\niscoelasticity in normal functioning and disease. Knowles and\noucher (2002) noted that increased liquid volume in PHA may\nesult in reduced PCL viscoelasticity, whichmay increase clearance.\ne have preliminary modelling data using an extension of slender\nody theory that suggests thatviscoelastic effectsmaysubstantially\neduce both the forces on cilia \u2013 enabling continued beating at high\niscosity\u2013but also reduce clearance. Another example is determin-\nng the effect of loss of ciliated epithelium, including lesions and\nntercellular space edema, characteristic of asthma (Donno et al.,\n000). Fulford and Blake (1986b) provided insight into the effect of\neducedciliaryactivity, and thecompensating roleof cilium\u2013mucus\nnteraction. However, the effect of large deciliated regions is not yet\nnderstood theoretically. It may be that the rheological properties\nf mucus are important in preserving flow over such regions.\nFuture modelling will also progress through the inclusion of\nrogressively more of the multiscale biological system, leading\nventually to models of all or part of the organ, as is being pur-\nued by the Chapel Hill group. We conclude by describing some\nmportant examples of the wider biological system.\nOn the sub-micron scale, models for the coupled beating and\nnternal mechanics of cilia may in future be developed to take into\nccount signalling to and from the epithelial cell, and other aspects\nf the molecular biology.

Smith et al. \/ Respiratory Physio\nodels remain to be developedwhich consider the possible role of\nilia, interacting with mucin molecules, in producing this system,\nnd the breakdown of the system in disease states. The glycocalyx\nKnowles and Boucher, 2002) has not been included in any theoret-\ncal models, and may have important effects on fluid transport. A\nodel of endothelial glycocalyx has been given byWeinbaum et al.\n2003). Additionally, modelling of the secretion of mucin granules,\nheir hydration, and the effect of ion concentrations and ciliamove-\nent, coupled back to the effect of mucus hydration on rheology\nnd hence ASL transport may give further insight.\nOn longer length scales, osmotic fluxes through the epithelium\nill have at the very least transient effects on the fluid flow in the\nCL in the in vivo situation. Thismay increase theflow in thePCL sig-\nificantly, provided the pressure gradients created are sufficiently\narge. On the millimetre to centimetre lengthscale, the effect of\nhe bifurcating structure of the airways has not been taken into\nccount in anymathematical models. The fluid dynamics of airway\nurface liquid at and near to these bifurcations may be considered,\nnd variations in the fluid transport along airways between bifur-\nations may also be of interest, particularly in determining how\nhe ASL is regulated, possibly by osmosis or by mucus hydration,\ns the liquid depth increases due to a bifurcation. Models may be\neveloped of the global balance of fluid and salt, which could then\ne integrated with models of how ion channels are regulated by\nucleotides and other signals, and how in turn these signals may\ne regulated by shear stress. This would enable an understanding\nf the wider system that regulates PCL depth and the assessment\nf parameters governing its normal modulation. Finally, models\nf MCC have not been coupled to models for the formation and\nreakupof clinically importantmucusplugs. Theeffect of cilia beat-\nng on the movement on such a plug does not appear to have been\ntudied.\ncknowledgement\nDJS acknowledges a Medical Research Council Special Training\nellowship in Computational Biology.\neferences\nlbers, G.M., Tomkiewicz, R.P., May, M.K., Ramirez, O.E., Rubin, B.K., 1996.
