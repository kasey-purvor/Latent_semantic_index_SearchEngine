The paper moves on to suggest that moral agency can be economically viable in \ncompetitive \u2018market\u2019 interactions, which is conventionally disputed by classical \/ neo-classical \nand institutional, libertarian economics. The paper here conceptualises active moral agency of \nthe firm as the utilisation of ethical capital in firm\u2013stakeholder interactions. This yields a \nreinterpretation of instrumental stakeholder theory. \n  \n \n 3\nAn Economic Approach to Business Ethics: \nMoral Agency of the Firm and the Enabling and Constraining \nEffects of Economic Institutions and Interactions in a Market \nEconomy \n \nMuch contemporary business ethics theory proceeds in a behavioural tradition. For example, \nvirtue theory-based business ethics or Kantian stakeholder management examine corporate \nmoral agency in relation to the question of human nature and proper moral\u2013behavioural \nconduct of the individual organisation member, in particular managers (Buono and Nichols, \n1990; Carroll, 1991; Evans and Freeman, 1993; Preston 1997; Murphy, 1998; Bartlett and \nPreston 2000; Moore, 2002; see also Barnard, 1958; Etzioni, 1988; Simon, 1993; K\u00fcng, \n1999; Sacks 1999; Fort, 2000). In practical perspective, behavioural business ethics aim to \nmorally (re)-educate managers, employees, shareholders, etc. (Lampe, 1997; Key, 1997; \nSeshadri et al., 1997; Hill and Stewart, 1999; Izzo 2000; Siu et al., 2000; von Dran et al., \n2001). The goal is to make them less self-interested but more virtuous, altruistic, \ncompassionate, benevolent, and so on. \n  The present paper outlines a different research agenda for business ethics. It \nreconstructs corporate moral agency through economic concepts. The paper conceptualises \nmarket interactions (\u2018the moves of the game\u2019) through a capital utilisation model. Interacting \nagents are modelled as contributing capital to and receiving capital from exchange interactions. \nOnly if mutual gains and the mutual satisfaction of interests result from capital exchange, is an \ninteraction expected to materialise and to be sustainable over time. The paper interprets \neconomic institutions (\u2018the rules of the game\u2019) as incentive structures. Incentive structures \ninfluence behaviour by signalling gains and losses, for example business laws on bribery. They \n  \n \n 4\nattach positive or negative sanctions to choice alternatives of the individual agent regarding \ncapital contributed and capital received in economic interactions. Incentive structures make a \nrational agent choose a certain choice option if gains (losses) expected from that choice option \nare higher (lower) than gains (losses) expected from alternatives. Many rules of the game are \ncreated through legislation (\u2018public ordering\u2019). Only within the confines of public order rules, \ncan firms create \u2018own\u2019 rules, through organisational structuring (\u2018private ordering\u2019).  \nThe outlined economic approach to moral agency and stakeholder management builds \nmerely heuristically on a model of dilemmatic interest conflicts (Homann, 1994; Wagner-\nTsukamoto, 2003) and on the model of economic man (Hayek, 1949; Friedman, 1953; Becker, \n1976; 1993; Homann, 1994; Wagner-Tsukamoto, 2001b; 2003). In certain respects Cima and \nSchubeck (2001), two Catholic theological researchers, understand this important \nmethodological issue of economic research (For a recent review of this issue, see Wagner-\nTsukamoto, 2003, Chapters 7, 8). The heuristic nature of the ideas \u2018economic man\u2019 and \n\u2018dilemmatic interest conflict\u2019 are easily misunderstood. If students, managers, consultants or \nresearchers interpret \u2018economic man\u2019 and \u2018interest conflicts\u2019 in theoretical\u2013practical perspective, \ne.g. as economics\u2019 image of human nature and image of social life or as a behavioural \nrecommendation to act like an economic man or to engage in the escalation of interest conflicts, \nthis needs to be corrected. The correction would be to point out the heuristic, functional nature of \nthese ideas for economic theorising and economic intervention, but not to replace them with \nconcepts of behavioural research. Behavioural business ethics, similar to behavioural economics \n(Margolis, 1982; Etzioni 1988; Sen, 1987, 1990; Simon 1993), misunderstands the economic \napproach in this respect when critiquing the model of economic man and the idea of dilemmatic \ninterest conflict in empirical\u2013behavioural and moral\u2013behavioural perspective, even viewing them \nas the cause of immoral business behaviour. Figure 1 provides a summary of this understanding \nof the institutional economic approach (See also Wagner-Tsukamoto, 2003). \n FIGURE 1\nThe Institutional Economic Approach\n1.\nEconomic man\n(Heuristic)\n2. \nDilemma structure\n(Heuristic)\n4.\nSocial interactions regarding \ncapital contributions and distributions\n3. \nIncentive rules for capital \ncontributions and distributions\n5. \nMutual gains as \ndesired interaction outcome\n The analytical starting point of this paper compares to the usual moral philosophical \napproach. Ethical doctrines as diverse as virtue ethics, duty ethics or consequentialism \nsubscribe to the principle that a person is expected to abide only by a moral precept if he\/she \nhas the required capabilities to do so. For instance, when a non-swimmer falls into deep water \n \n \n \n 5\n  \n \n 6\nand is drowning, a bystander is expected to jump into the water and save the non-swimmer \nbut only if the bystander can swim. A moral ought (\u2018moral responsibility\u2019) always implies a \npractical can (\u2018competence\u2019). The paper argues that this consideration has far reaching \nimplications for the question of corporate moral agency that behavioural business ethics tend \nto overlook. As far as corporate behavioural business ethics consider this principle, they \npredominantly do so in a behavioural spirit, identifying, in the tradition of Kohlberg, the lack \nof cognitive moral development of managers as a cause of inadequate corporate moral \nagency, for example Preston (1997), Bartlett and Preston (2000) or Izzo (2000). The present \npaper examines constraints other than behavioural on moral agency of the firm. The key thesis \nis that constraining and enabling economic effects on moral agency, as exerted by the incentive \nlogic of economic institutions and the capital exchange logic of economic interactions, need to be \nconsidered for ensuring successful moral\u2013behavioural intervention, e.g. ethics education for \nmanagers. Otherwise, behavioural business ethics programs only succeed in a sporadic, \naccidental, and temporary manner, namely as long as moral\u2013behavioural intervention is \ncompatible with economic effects. \n The paper suggests to theoretically model and practically intervene with corporate \nmoral agency in relation to the systemising of morality in incentive structures and the \ncapitalising of morality in firm\u2013stakeholder interactions. The paper argues that in this way a \ntheoretically more coherent approach to business ethics and stakeholder management emerges \nthan a moral\u2013behavioural one and that economic intervention is practically more effective than \nbehavioural intervention, especially under the competitive conditions of the market economy and \nof the modern, pluralistic society in general.  \n In Part I, the paper takes up the classical and neo-classical view, which points out a moral \nquality of competitive market ordering. The related concept of unintentional corporate moral \nagency is spelled out. This is important since the paper examines moral agency of the firm by \n  \n \n 7\ntaking for granted the concept of the market economy, especially the endorsement and enactment \nof competitive market ordering through public order rules. Most behavioural business ethics \nresearch, if I interpret correctly, accepts this, too, although, behavioural research implicitly and \nunwittingly drifts often into a system critique of the market economy, namely when it questions \ncompetitive market ordering as the interaction mechanism and self-interest as driving force of \nsocial exchange. System exit or system change could then be elaborated on. System exit may \nimply the retreat into localised markets and small, self-sufficient communities where \nmembership is restricted \u2013 probably in an anti-pluralistic, tribal, pre-modern manner \u2013 to those \nwho share same beliefs, that is where group membership is linked to a value consensus. The \nAmish people\u2019s religious fundamentalism or certain ecotopian concepts are illustrative. More \nradically, if system change is advocated, system alternatives have to be outlined. Since the fading \nof communism, however, there seem to be few credible alternatives to organising societal \ninteractions in a different way than through a market economy. Reasons for the failure of \ncommunism, such as anti-pluralistic tendencies and systemic defects regarding the effective and \nefficient organisation of economic activity in society, hold important lessons for business ethics \ntheory which explicitly or implicitly advocates system change (Hayek 1960, 1979). \n In Part II, the paper takes an institutional, libertarian approach to economics, which \nassesses institutional structures (the rules of the game) for constraining economic effects on \ncorporate moral agency, e.g. the institutional enactment of profitability as a survival \nrequirement for the firm and of competition as a mechanism for ordering social interactions, \ne.g. through business laws such as bankruptcy laws, anti-trust laws, etc. The paper specifies \nhere corporate moral agency as passive intentional agency in relation to moral minimum \nstandards that are economically enacted through public ordering. In relation to such \ninstitutional structures, the paper discusses nature, feasibility and scope of systemically \nenabled moral agency of the firm. This details the conventional economic understanding of \n  \n \n 8\nbusiness ethics that market interactions (the moves of the game) regarding capital exchange \noccur and should occur in a moral-free zone (Hayek, 1960; Friedman, 1970; Smith, 1976; \nHayek, 1979). The discussion of passive moral agency further develops suggestions on \n\u2018incentive ethics\u2019 (Homann, 1997).  \n In Part III, the paper analyses interactions (the moves of the game) for constraining \/ \nenabling effects on corporate moral agency, specifically the lack \/ availability of ethical \ncapital in firm\u2013stakeholder interactions. The paper questions in this respect a sceptical stance \nof classical and neo-classical economics as well as institutional, libertarian approaches that, \napart from unintentional and passive moral agency, corporate moral agency is not \neconomically viable in market interactions and even undermines unintentional and passive \nmoral agency. The paper models active moral agency of the firm as the utilisation of ethical \ncapital in firm\u2013stakeholder interactions. It suggests that once morality is transformed into an \neconomic asset, corporate moral agency yields competitive advantage, increases profitability \nand increases survival prospects of the firm. In this respect, insufficient corporate moral \nagency is analysed not as a systemic, rule-based condition of defective incentive structures \nbut as a capital utilisation problem in firm-stakeholder interactions. \n Thus when the paper moves from Part I to Part II and then to Part III, a dichotomised \nview on business ethics and economics is questioned step-by-step and further revised. \n \nI. The Classical and Neo-classical View: Competitive Market Ordering and the \nElimination of Morals from Economic Interactions \n \nEconomic institutions of the market economy make firm survival directly dependent on \nprofitability but not on the extent of moral agency shown in interactions with other firms, \n  \n \n 9\ncustomers, suppliers, society at large, etc.1 The sociologist Max Weber realised this early on \nwhen stating in his famous treatise The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism: \n \n It [the capitalistic economy] forces the individual, in so far as he is involved in the system \nof market relationships, to conform to capitalistic rules of action. The manufacturer who \nin the long run acts counter to these norms, will just as inevitably be eliminated from the \neconomic scene as the worker who cannot adapt himself to them will be thrown into the \nstreets without a job. (Weber, 1930, pp. 54\u20135) \nAnd: \n Whoever does not adapt his manner of life to the conditions of capitalistic success must \ngo under, or at least cannot rise. (Weber, 1930, p. 72) \n \nIn this regard, the costs of moral agency have to be considered for understanding why moral \nagency is difficult to pursue by the firm. If moral agency is costly and unprofitable, a firm suffers \nsurvival disadvantages in comparison to \u2018less moral\u2019 firms. Then, competitive market ordering \ninstigates interaction dynamics which eliminate morals from the moves of the game.2 Over time, \nmoral firms are driven out of the market and the moral conscience of managers is self-\neliminating (Hardin, 1968; Homann, 1997; Gambetta, 1988; Good, 1988). The eventual failures \nof charitable religious owner-managers, such as Quaker employers, is insightful here since the \nsincerity and depth of their moral convictions may be less questioned than the ones of \u2018plain\u2019, \nprofessional managers (Wagner-Tsukamoto, 2001b, 2003). \n \n \nA. Unintentional Moral Agency of the Firm: The \u2018Wealth of Nations\u2019 as Moral Outcome \n \n  \n \n 10\nSince competitive market ordering can punish costly moral agency of the firm, one might be \ntempted to judge the competitive market as immoral, both regarding outcomes of social \ninteractions \u2013 the constraining and eliminating of corporate moral agency in market \ninteractions \u2013 and regarding the self-interested image of human nature that it seemingly \nimplies. Behavioural business ethics and behavioural economics voice such concerns \n(Etzioni, 1988; Sen, 1990; Simon, 1993; Bartlett and Preston, 2000). The moral legitimacy of \nthe market economy can then be questioned and system change can be advocated, aiming to \nreplace competition as the interaction and co-ordination mechanism of economic activity. \n Classical and neo-classical economics agrees with the diagnosis that competitive market \nordering may undermine moral agency. It views corporate moral agency as infeasible in the \nmoves of the game. Market ordering itself is thought to best occur in a moral-free zone (apart \nfrom moral standards enacted through public ordering; see below). This was implied by \nSmith, prominently restated by Hayek and Friedman, and further detailed by Buchanan and \nNorth (Hayek, 1960, 1976, 1979; Friedman, 1970; Buchanan, 1975; Smith, 1976; North, \n1993b; see also Popper, 1962). But in this understanding of economics, the elimination of \nmoral agency from the moves of the game does not necessarily constitute a moral problem. \nThe opposite can be the case. Economics argues for competitive market ordering on moral \ngrounds. This is based on the expectation that competitive market ordering yields desirable \noutcomes for society as a whole \u2013 the \u2018wealth of nations\u2019, as Smith put it \u2013 but not the wealth of \na few (Wagner-Tsukamoto, 2003, Section 8.1). Indeed, if Adam Smith's outline of economics \ndid not reflect a moral science, it would be difficult to comprehend why Smith, after decades \nof behavioural ethics research and on the basis of a profound understanding of behavioural \nethics, ultimately favored economics to address moral questions of society. \n The studies of Hayek, Friedman, Buchanan and North argued in detail that the market \neconomy delivers prosperity, fairness and liberty in societal interactions better than other \n  \n \n 11\ndoctrines, e.g. communism. Once the market economy produces socially desirable outcomes, the \nfirm is involved in moral agency, namely unintentional moral agency (Homann, 1997; \nHomann and Suchanek, 2000; see also Baurmann and Kliemt, 1995). Only on this ground can \nclassical and neo-classical economic theses on business ethics be justified: see, for example, \u2018The \nSocial Responsibility of Business is to Increase its Profits.\u2019 (Friedman, 1970)  \n These considerations mark an important starting point for assessing the moral \nlegitimacy of the market economy and the question of business ethics. Behavioural ethics here \ntends to struggle with the implied conceptualisation of moral agency as unintended result of self-\ninterested choice, and the morally argued endorsement of competition, which implies non-co-\noperation in interactions among firms (Wagner-Tsukamoto, 2001b). \n In this connection it is important to note that it is the very conception and endorsement of \ncompetition as an interaction mechanism that enables economics to conceptually and practically \naccommodate value pluralism in social interactions. Such accommodation is important since \npluralism can be viewed as a socially desirable interaction condition. But, anyway, in many \ninteraction contexts pluralism is an unavoidable interaction condition. These are contexts which \nare defined by competitive market ordering and the political\u2013legal institutionalisation of the \nmarket economy as well as by industrialisation, the growth of societies, urbanisation, and \ninternationalisation and globalisation. In such \u2018modern\u2019 contexts,3 the theoretical fruitfulness, \npractical effectiveness, moral relevance, and moral quality of behavioural ethics, which build on \nthe vision of an anti-pluralistic value consensus, are in doubt.4 An important thesis here is that \nfor ethical and effective intervention in social interactions in a large city, the multi-national firm, \nthe multi-cultural society, global markets, or the international community, an economic approach \nto (business) ethics has to be prioritised over a behavioural one. \n \n \n  \n \n 12\nB. Slack as Enabler of Corporate Moral Agency? \n \nWhen considering competitive market ordering, a \u2018slack-based\u2019 argumentation for business \nethics (Buono and Nichols, 1990; see also Etzioni, 1988; Simon, 1993) has to be qualified. A \nslack-based approach to business ethics proposes corporate altruism and corporate philanthropy, \nsuggesting that a firm should spend \u2018slack resources\u2019, such as profits, on ethical courses, such as \nphilanthropy.5 The idea of slack implies economic competence and opportunity of the firm to \nengage in moral agency. However, in competitive markets, slack-based business ethics are likely \nto run into problems. Moral firms which spend slack on altruistic causes have fewer resources \navailable than less moral firms when preparing for survival, e.g. buffering a firm against \nuncertain, future market developments, making R&D investments into the generation of future \nmarket opportunities, and so on. Hence they are disadvantaged in competitive processes. Both \nWeber (1930) and Friedman (1970) implied this. Also, a slack-based conceptualisation of \ncorporate moral agency implies that firms would only engage in moral agency if slack existed. \nWhen competition toughens and survival conditions deteriorate, costly moral agency is disposed \nof. Thus, business ethics become not a categorical but a hypothetical, highly conditioned \nendeavour, relying on the existence of uncompetitive and highly imperfect markets. For a motive \nethics such as a religious ethics, a virtue ethics, or duty ethics, this approach to moral agency is \nlikely to lead to considerable conceptual inconsistencies since motives are no longer grounded in \ncategorical precepts. And, practically this leaves the virtuous, religious or dutiful manager with \nsevere conflicts of conscience and awkward decision-making regarding how to retreat from \nmoral agency when the going gets tough (Wagner-Tsukamoto, 2001b). \n The argument that competitive market ordering undermines moral agency, as implied by \nthe argument of slack, can be revised in various respects. For one thing, if corporate moral \nagency were less costly than \u2018non-moral\u2019 agency, competitive market ordering can be expected \n  \n \n 13\nto almost automatically moralise corporate behaviour. But in this case, there is not much debate \nabout business ethics. The remainder of this paper discusses different qualifications of the \nclassical and neo-classical suggestion that competitive market ordering eliminates moral agency \nfrom economic interactions. The paper argues that in certain circumstances the cost of moral \nagency does not disadvantage a firm in processes of competitive market ordering. The \nunderlying assumption is the one of competitive markets. This is a much weaker assumption \nthan perfect competition of general equilibrium theory. On the one hand, through public \nordering, corporate moral agency can be systemically enforced through the institutional rules of \nthe market economy. Thus, the same costs of moral agency are imposed on all firms. Hence, the \ncost of moral agency is competition neutral. In this respect, Part II of this paper details the \nconcept of systemically enabled passive moral agency of the firm. In Part III, the paper looks into \nthe profitability of business ethics. If corporate moral agency creates revenue which covers costs \nof moral agency, then (and only then) moral agency is sustainable in the moves of the game \nbeyond moral standards enforced through public ordering. The paper discusses the profitability \nof moral agency as active moral agency. The idea of ethical capital is spelled out. It implies that \nmarket segments of ethically committed stakeholders of the firm are willing to pay costs of \nactive moral agency and thus create additional revenue for moral firms. In this respect the paper \novercomes the classical and neo-classical dichotomy of economics versus ethics regarding \nmarket interactions. \n \n \nII. A Libertarian, Institutional Economic View: Passive Corporate Moral Agency and \nEnacting the \u2018Moral Minimum\u2019 Through Public Order Structures \n \n  \n \n 14\nIncentive structures induce rule-following on grounds of self-interested choice. Buchanan\u2019s and \nWilliamson\u2019s insights here can be transferred to an economic analysis of moral agency of the \nfirm. Buchanan conceptualised public order structures, e.g. laws, as incentive structures while \nWilliamson\u2019s institutional economics similarly examined organisational, \u2018private order\u2019 \nstructures of the firm, e.g. reward systems. (Buchanan, 1975, 1987a, 1987b, 1991; Williamson, \n1985; Brennan and Buchanan 1986). As Buchanan specified, for public order structures to be \neffective, expected gains from breaking a rule have to be lower than expected losses (See also \nBecker 1976, 1993; Vanberg, 1988, 2001; North, 1993a, 1993b), or differently put, rule-\nfollowing has to be compatible with self-interest.6 On the other hand, if expected losses from \nbreaking a public order rule are outweighed by expected gains, an agent can be expected to break \npublic order rules. In this way, public ordering is brought under an economic calculus for the \nfirm, a calculus of competitive advantage, profitability and survival. Regarding corporate moral \nagency, public order structures are a means to systemically codify moral precepts (in laws, in the \nrules of the game) and arm codifications with economic and criminal sanctions. Thus, moral\u2013\nbehavioural rules are systemised in economic terms. Then, incentive structures systemically \nenable moral agency (Homann, 1997; Homann and Suchanek, 2000). In this respect, public \nordering creates social capital, that is, it reflects investments of the past enforcement of moral \nrules (Vanberg, 1988, p. 33). \n With regard to the enforced and indirect nature of corporate moral agency that is so \nenacted through public ordering, the idea of passive moral agency can be invoked. From a \nteleological, consequentialist point of view (but less so from a deontological position), it can be \nexamined how far such passive moral agency of the firm can be considered intentional moral \nagency. \n A key strength of enforcing moral agency through public ordering is that it is competition \nneutral: It imposes the same sanctions and the same costs for moral agency on all firms. Thus, \n  \n \n 15\npublic ordering creates a level playing field regarding costs of moral agency. Public ordering has \nin this respect the advantage over private ordering. A good example is reward structures of the \nfirm which allocate bonuses to salesmen in relation to sales volume but independent of moral \nassessments of how sales were generated, e.g. through corruption or bribery. Frequently, such \nproblems cannot be resolved by private ordering, e.g. the inclusion of business ethics rules in a \ncorporate mission statement (even if violations of rules were effectively sanctioned by the firm). \nThe reason is that costly sanctions voluntarily imposed by the firm for moral misconduct of its \nmembers are not competition neutral. If they lead to lower profits and competitive disadvantages, \nthe scope for enacting moral agency through private ordering is limited.  \n But there are also limits to which morality can be economically systemised through \npublic ordering, even if public ordering comes with economically effective sanctions. For \nincentive structures to induce and organise social exchange, outcomes of choice behaviour have \nto be generally advantageous to all involved in an interaction. Mutual gains have to result. \nWilliamson (1985, p. 76) speaks here of the \u2018incentive-compatibility\u2019 of governance structures. \nPublic order structures which systemise moral agency in a confiscatory, \u2018communist\u2019 manner, \ne.g. taxing corporate profits at a 85 percentage-rate, are likely to be ineffective since they \neliminate private gains and self-interest as the co-ordination force of social interactions. In this \ncase, rules become \u2018dis-incentive structures\u2019, even undermining outcomes of unintentional moral \nagency. It appears that public ordering can only effectively enforce moral minimum standards. It \nneeds to leave the market mechanism intact. \n Furthermore, the systemising of morality in public order structures is constrained by \nthe internationalisation of markets. On global markets, the effectiveness of public ordering is \npotentially eroded from outside national markets (Vanberg 2001). Elimination forces, as \ndiscussed for moral private ordering in relation to market ordering, can be observed for \npublic ordering in relation to international market ordering. One nation\u2019s lower, less costly \n  \n \n 16\npublic order standards regarding corporate moral agency undermine higher, more costly \nstandards of other nations. Market dynamics based on ethical stakeholder behaviour, as \ndiscussed below as \u2018active moral agency\u2019, can to a certain extent protect a national market from \nless moral, international competition. The argument regarding the erosion of moral standards on \nnational markets can also be qualified in relation to existing productivity differentials, \ndifferentials in capital structures, transaction costs and relocation costs, etc. Yet, on many \ncompetitive, international markets, the playing field with the lowest, least costly moral rules \ntends to constrain other regulators, unless protectionist measures are taken that directly \nintervene in the moves of the game and restrict market access. Such restrictions, however, \ncan undermine socially desirable outcomes regarding unintentional moral agency, such as the \nwealth of nations.7\n \n \n \nIII. Revisions to the Classical \/Neo-classical and Institutional, Libertarian View: Active \nCorporate Moral Agency and the \u2018Capitalising\u2019 of Morality in Economic Interactions \n \nThere is empirical evidence that corporate moral agency is feasible in the moves of the game, \nexceeding in a sustainable manner moral minimum standards of public ordering and being viable \nunder competitive conditions of the market economy (Wagner, 1997; Dunfee 1998): \n \n\u2022 Environmentally-oriented shopping. Driven by green consumer behaviour and green \npressure group campaigns, environmentally-oriented shopping has affected corporate \nbehaviour. For example, the Body Shop has built a multinational enterprise by producing \n  \n \n 17\nand retailing products which are environmentally friendlier than competitor products. \nShell's Brent Spar experience is another example in the opposite direction. \n \n\u2022 Animal welfare issues. Some consumers take account of animal welfare issues when \nmaking a buying decision. For example, they consider whether product ingredients have \nbeen tested on animals. Such consumer behaviour had a considerable impact on firms, \ne.g. producers and retailers of cosmetics. \n \n\u2022 Fair Trading with Third World Farmers. So-called fair-traded products, e.g. Cafe Direct, \nare retailed at a price premium in order to cover higher sourcing prices paid to farmers in \ndeveloping countries. \n \nIn these examples, firms engage in a sustainable manner in corporate moral agency that exceeds \nmoral minimum standards of public ordering. Apparently, the managers of the Body Shop, Shell, \nor Caf\u00e9 Direct have different experiences regarding the feasibility of moral agency under \nconditions of competitive market ordering than did Quaker managers or other early factory \nmanagers (Wagner-Tsukamoto, 2001b, forthcoming; see also Child, 1964; Taylor, 1964). Hence, \nthe conventional economic view that corporate moral agency can only come as unintentional \nagency or at best as passive, intentional agency needs certain revisions. The paper develops such \nrevisions within an economic framework, outlining a \u2018third\u2019 route of a \u2018practical can\u2019 of \ncorporate moral agency. It models active moral agency: the firm enacting in the moves of the \ngame moral standards that exceed the ones of public ordering. The idea of ethical capital is \ndrawn upon for conceptualising the profitability of corporate moral agency. The paper thus \nexamines whether costs of moral agency can be recouped from stakeholders who exchange \n  \n \n 18\ncapital with a firm. An economic business ethics theory is arrived at, which connects to a \nconsequentialist, utilitarian interpretation of instrumental stakeholder management. \n In a pluralistic tradition, the proposed theory leaves the conceptualisation of moral \ndispositions of stakeholders open, e.g. whether they were virtuous stakeholders, dutiful \nstakeholders, religious or consequentialist stakeholders.8\n The present paper departs from behavioural economic approaches (Gauthier, 1986; \nSen, 1990; Simon, 1993; Baurmann and Kliemt, 1995) but also from evolutionary economic \napproaches (Axelrod, 1984) to conceptualising (corporate) morality in the moves of the \ngame. They expect contractual and\/or behavioural self-binding to emerge over time. Thus, \nmoral agency in these approaches is viewed as an exchange catalyst but moral agency is not \nthe subject of capital exchange. In this respect, the paper diverts from a virtue economics and \nan evolutionary economics. It conceptualises moral agency as (the utilisation of) production \ncapital, which is sold or bought in market interactions, but not as transaction capital, which \nmay help to stabilise market interactions (assuming effective self-binding). \n \n \nA. Ethical Capital \n \nFor an economic reconstruction of corporate moral agency, the Body Shop presents an especially \ninteresting case study. Many observers of the Body Shop agree that the Body Shop is \u2018more \nmoral\u2019 than other firms (in its industry). Since the Body Shop has survived very well over time, \ndespite costly engagements in moral agency, this requires an economic explanation; otherwise \nthe value of an economic reconstruction of business ethics can be doubted. Rather than drawing \non the argument of \u2018slack\u2019, I assess such firms as creators of ethical capital which is profitably \n  \n \n 19\nexchanged with interested stakeholders (operating in competitive markets, where also \u2018less \nmoral\u2019 firms are encountered, which do not engage in costly, voluntary business ethics).  \n Only as long as the firm cannot recoup costs of moral agency from consumers, \nemployees, investors or other agents (\u2018stakeholders\u2019, see below) who interact with the firm, do \nprofitability and related survival issues constrain moral agency to unintentional agency and \npassive agency. As discussed, the latter reflects the abeyance of moral minimum standards that \nare enforced by public ordering (effective economic sanctioning of public ordering assumed). On \nthe other hand, if corporate moral agency contributes to profitability and creates survival \nadvantages, the conventional economic view, as outlined in Parts I and II, that market ordering \noccurs in a moral-free zone can be qualified. Such corporate moral agency can be termed active \nmoral agency. It can be conceptualised through a capital utilisation model of social exchange.9 \nAgents who interact with the firm are modelled as capitalists who contribute resources to and \nreceive resources from exchange interactions with the firm. If an agent uses capital to enact \nethical interests, the firm gains or loses in interactions with such agents, depending on whether \nthe firm successfully satisfied moral interests of these agents. Thus morally minded agents can \nenable economic competence of the firm to engage in moral agency beyond unintentional and \npassive agency. \n In this conceptualisation of active corporate moral agency, morality is approached as an \neconomic asset, as ethical capital. Ethical capital reflects the \u2018price\u2019 a morally minded \nconsumer, employee, investor or other agent puts on active moral agency. It indicates an \nagent\u2019s economic willingness and resourcefulness to pay for active moral agency of the firm. \nThe idea of ethical capital thus specifies what Dunfee (1998, p. 128) described as a \u2018\u2026 \ndecision with an economic impact influenced by a passion of propriety\u2019 that reflects \u2018an input \ninto the marketplace of morality.\u2019 The idea of ethical capital implies that the question of \nbusiness ethics is examined in the same way as questions of how a firm successfully buys, \n  \n \n 20\ncreates, sells \u2013 utilises \u2013 commodities such as human capital, technological capital, brand capital, \nsite-specific capital, etc. Regarding its intangible nature, ethical capital compares to intellectual \nhuman capital (Becker, 1976, 1996), social capital (Coleman, 1988; Vanberg 1988) or brand \nequity (e.g. Aacker, 1991). Such capital reflects the economic valuation of psychological or \nsociological features of products and services. \n Active moral agency of the firm and the creation of ethical capital can be initiated by \n(the managers of) the firm. The firm can produce ethical capital by utilising, for example, \nproduction processes and distribution processes in ways that surpass moral minimum standards \nof public ordering and\/or which outperform competitor behaviour regarding moral agency. In the \nabove mentioned examples of the Body Shop or Caf\u00e9 Direct, it was the firm that successfully \nnourished a market segment of ethically committed and economically resourceful agents, e.g. \ngreen consumers. In this regard, private ordering can \u2018moralise\u2019 market ordering. Another \nexample is corporate social initiatives which can set up economic pay-offs (Hess et al., 2002). \nCharity shops, e.g. Oxfam, are further examples of organisations that actively built and \nanticipated ethical preferences of consumers and transformed them into economic assets. Albeit \nusing a different approach, Frank\u2019s (1996) discussion of market opportunities created by ethical \nbusiness behaviour moves into a similar direction. \n On the other hand, market ordering can \u2018moralise\u2019 private ordering. Active corporate \nmoral agency can be initiated by resourceful agents who interact with the firm and back up moral \ninterests with capital. For example, a firm may have to follow market demand of morally high-\nminded, green consumers who are willing to pay a price premium for environmentally friendlier \nproducts. A good example is the cosmetics industry, in which the Body Shop\u2019s successful \ncatering for ethical consumers had over time a considerable impact on other firms. The \ngovernment or the judiciary can in this way enact active corporate moral agency, too, for \nexample in relation to discretionary powers they enjoy regarding the setting of fines, making \n  \n \n 21\nchanges to taxation, etc. For example, in US-jurisdiction, courts frequently decide the extent of \npenalties by considering a firm's ethical track record, e.g. the treatment of employees, \nsponsorship of cultural events, support given to local communities, donations to environmental \ncauses, etc. Thus, an economic pay-off-rationale for active moral agency of the firm is \nestablished. \n More drastic examples are consumer boycotts organised by pressure groups (Smith, \n1990). A consumer boycott has a similar enabling effect on active moral agency as consumer \ndemand for ethical products and services. A pressure group which successfully organises a \nconsumer boycott in effect appropriates market capitalisation of the firm, e.g. market share and \nsales volume. Such influence is exerted through any stakeholder boycott. For example, a strike \norganised by a union has a similar effect (see below). Once appropriated, market capitalisation is \nredistributed to other firms or is just destroyed. Shell's Brent Spar experience is a classic \nexample. Although a pressure group does not directly exchange capital with a firm (unless being \nan employee, shareholder, or customers at the same time), it can influence capital dispositions of \nother agents who interact with the firm. Such influence reflects the capability of a pressure group \nto intervene in market ordering. This may be equally effective or even more effective than direct \ncapital exchange with the firm since the impact on the firm can be quickly multiplied (once a \nboycott catches on), is immediate, unexpected and more difficult to counteract by the firm. \n \n \nB. Towards an Economic Theory of Business Ethics: Stakeholders and the Demand for \nEthical Capital \n \nThe following section links the concepts of ethical capital and active corporate moral agency to \nan economic interpretation of stakeholder management. In the 1960s, the Stanford Research \n  \n \n 22\nInstitute (SRI) interpreted the idea of the stake as an interest of an agent (\u2018stakeholder\u2019) who can \ninfluence, through economic dispositions, the profitability and survival prospects of the firm \n(Freeman, 1984). Drawing on the above capital utilisation model of social exchange, the idea of \nthe stake can be specified as interests that are backed by capital contributions of an agent.10 In \nthis way, stakeholder management is instrumentally approached in relation to the capability \nof an agent to influence the firm's profitability and survival prospects through capital \ndispositions. On the other hand, if an agent cannot contribute capital of one form or another \nto the firm, he\/she does not qualify as a stakeholder. On economic grounds, the firm would \nnot be expected to take account of his\/her interests. \n On the basis of a capital utilisation model of stakeholder management, the question of \nactive moral agency of the firm can be more precisely formulated.11 Low levels of active \ncorporate moral agency are theoretically analysed and practically intervened in as a capital \nutilisation problem, specifically as a problem of inadequate demand for ethical capital by \nstakeholders. The resulting model of stakeholder management is an instrumental one. It differs \nfrom conventional, behavioural approaches to stakeholder management and business ethics. \nMost importantly, an instrumental, economic approach to stakeholder management takes account \nof the economic viability of corporate moral agency under the conditions of the market economy. \nThe principle that a \u2018moral ought\u2019 implies a \u2018practical can\u2019 is thus paid attention to. Specifically: \n \n\u2022 The outlined economic approach to stakeholder management models active moral agency \nin a strictly hypothetical manner: namely, in relation to the profitable production of \nethical capital for morally high-minded and economically resourceful stakeholders. In \nthis respect, it differs from virtue theory or Kantian stakeholder models. The latter imply \na categorical approach to stakeholder management, which reflects their less specific \ninterpretation of the \u2018stake\u2019 as a mere interest of an agent, independent of the assessment \n  \n \n 23\nof capital contributions an agent is capable and willing to make to the firm. A pay-off \nrationale for corporate moral agency is not conceptualised, thus abandoning the SRI \nunderstanding of the \u2018stake\u2019 (e.g. Buono and Nichols, 1990; Evans and Freeman, 1993). \nAlso, the outlined approach conceptualises the hypothetical nature of moral agency \ndifferently than, for example, a slack-based approach to business ethics, which \nhypothetically models moral agency as the spending of available profits on altruistic \ncauses. \n \n\u2022 The question of moral responsibility of the firm is redirected. In the first place, \nstakeholders are asked this question. Only on the basis of willingness and resourcefulness \nof stakeholders to pay for active corporate moral agency, is the question of business \nethics handed to the firm.  \n \n\u2022 The resolution of stakeholder conflicts is brought under an economic calculus. \nConflicting stakeholder interests are prioritised in relation to the extent that an agent can \ninfluence the profitability and survival of the firm. In contrast, behavioural stakeholder \nmanagement tends to suggest that the firm should resolve interest conflicts among \nstakeholders in an egalitarian manner, taking equal account of all interests. Basically, \nmoral agency by means of consensus management is promoted. Kantian stakeholder \nmanagement or a slack-based approach face in this respect unresolved practical problems \nto reconcile the satisfaction of diverse, conflicting stakeholder interests with the \nmaintenance of economic viability of the firm. \n \n\u2022 The proposed economic approach to stakeholder management examines the \nlegitimisation of corporate behaviour, and of the market economy in general, in relation \n  \n \n 24\nto socially desirable outcomes of firm\u2013stakeholder interactions, idealistically mutual \ngains that include the stakeholder global community. To a degree, the resulting \nlegitimisation of corporate behaviour and of the market economy can accommodate a \nbehavioural approach, e.g. a sociological argumentation for consumer sovereignty and \nconsumer democracy (Cochran, 1957). However, in various methodological, theoretical, \nand practical-normative respects reconciliation may be difficult, and the prioritising of an \neconomic approach over behavioural ones becomes an issue. \n \nFuture research has to further deepen these key ideas of an economic approach to stakeholder \nmanagement. The previous discussion provided only a first step to a fuller reinterpretation of \ninterrelationships among economics, ethics and stakeholder theory. \n \n \nIV. Conclusion \n \nSimilar to Adam Smith two centuries earlier, moral philosophers of our time, like MacIntyre \n(1985) diagnosed that modern society may have to ask what comes After Virtue. (See also \nWilliams, 1985.) Such scepticism regarding the effectiveness of behavioural ethics, especially in \nmodern, pluralistic contexts, is shared by economic philosophy (Buchanan 1975, 1987b, 1991; \nHomann, 1990, 1994,1997), systemic sociology of society (Luhmann, 1984, 1988), and Old \nTestament theology (Wagner, 2000; Wagner-Tsukamoto, 2001a). An economic approach to \nbusiness ethics can theoretically and practically handle an After Virtue-scenario, mainly because \nit does not rely on the homogeneity of moral values, virtues, religious beliefs, etc. when \nexamining the effectiveness of moral agency in group behaviour. This is due to its non-\nbehavioural conceptualisation of corporate moral agency in relation to economic institutions and \n  \n \n 25\neconomic interactions. Economic intervention strictly aims at incentive structures and capital \nutilisation but not the human condition in order to raise levels of corporate moral agency. From a \nheuristic perspective, this is mirrored by the application of the model of economic man and the \nidea of dilemmatic interest conflicts (see Figure 1). Under conditions of competitive market \nordering and\/or value pluralism, this approach is likely to be more effective and even preferable \non ethical grounds to behavioural ethics. \n The paper has modelled interrelating economic effects of public ordering, market \nordering, and private ordering in order to examine how moral agency of the firm is economically \nenabled and constrained. The paper has drawn attention to the classical economic idea of \nunintentional moral agency of the firm, which justifies the moral legitimacy of the market \neconomy. Intentional, passive moral agency has been discussed regarding moral minimum \nstandards that are economically enforced by public ordering. The paper has conceptualised \nintentional, active moral agency of the firm by drawing the idea of ethical capital and an \neconomic interpretation of stakeholder management. It has tightened the idea of the stake, \ninterpreting \u2018stake\u2019 as an interest that is backed by capital contributions to the firm. The \nstakeholder has been examined for willingness to pay for active moral agency of the firm. The \nsuccessful enactment of moral interests of stakeholders has been assessed in relation to the \ncreation and utilisation of ethical capital in firm\u2013stakeholder interactions. \n Regarding active moral agency, the proposed economic approach to business ethics \nqualifies conventional economic thought that corporate moral agency is limited to passive and \nunintentional moral agency and that active moral agency is detrimental to profitability and \nsurvival prospects of the firm. In (niche) markets where economically resourceful, morally high-\nminded agents are encountered, firm\u2013stakeholder interactions do not occur in a moral-free zone \n(that is \u2018only\u2019 regulated by public order standards).12 Through private ordering, a firm and its \nstakeholders can enact moral standards that surpass moral minimum standards enforced by \n  \n \n 26\npublic ordering. In order for private ordering to successfully enact such moral standards, the \npaper has argued that private ordering has to be compatible with market ordering, namely the \nincentive logic and the capital exchange logic of competitive markets (and it has to be \ncompatible with public ordering in this respect, too, namely rules which enforce competitive \nmarket ordering through cartel laws, anti-trust laws, bankruptcy laws, price dumping laws, etc). \n The outlined economic reconstruction of business ethics theory sheds new light on \npreviously inconclusive, empirical research on the feasibility and profitability of behavioural \nbusiness ethics, as recently reviewed by Bartlett and Preston (2000) and Moore and Robson \n(2002). Conceptual and practical problems and empirical inconclusiveness of research can be \npredicted for behavioural business ethics if corporate moral agency is not investigated for \nconstraining and enabling incentive effects of public ordering, market ordering and private \nordering and the utilisation of ethical capital in firm\u2013stakeholder interactions. Once these issues \nare considered, the practical success or failure of behavioural business ethics can be predicted on \nthe basis of compatibility or incompatibility with profitability and survival requirements of the \nfirm. \n The paper has demonstrated that corporate moral agency can be differently assessed \nother than by interpreting in behavioural terms the question of human nature and the principle \nthat a \u2018moral ought\u2019 implies a \u2018practical can\u2019. The paper has shown three routes of how to \ninterpret a \u2018practical can\u2019 in economic terms through concepts of unintentional moral agency, \nintentioned passive agency and active moral agency. It has thus spelled out various conceptual \ndimensions that put the debate of business ethics theory into perspective. However, the paper has \nnot generally questioned the relevance of behavioural ethics; especially for the ethical education \nof stakeholders its relevance is high. Nor does this paper question that a certain minimum \nconsensus of shared behavioural categories is likely to be required for any social interaction to \nsucceed (Luhmann, 1984, 1988; Good, 1988). Nevertheless, many behavioural researchers and \n  \n \n 27\ntheologians underestimate the extent to which the moral agency of the firm can be reconstructed \nand practically handled in economic terms. \n \n \n  \n \n 28\nREFERENCES \n \nAaker, D.

By means of contractual self-binding and\/or \nbehavioural self-binding, accompanied and enforced, for instance, by tit-for-tat strategies, moral \nagency is expected to enter market interactions. (See also Axelrod, 1984; Sacks 1999.) To some \nextent, this implies that the players of the prisoners\u2019 dilemma resolved for themselves the dilemma \nthey are caught up in. \n \n3 One can speak in this respect of the \u2018condition of modernity\u2019 (Luhmann, 1984, 1988; Gerecke, 1997). \n \n4 The success of some small groups, like the Amish people in USA, to preserve a per-modern interaction \ncontext in which behavioural ethics can effectively order social interactions is unlikely to provide much \nencouragement for behavioural (business) ethics research.  \n \n5 Furthermore, political\u2013legal issues of redistributing stockholder property may have to be investigated as \nwell as warnings, e.g. Hayek, that a firm in this way takes on a politically unaccounted for role as moral \nguardian. \n \n6 Opportunity costs for obeying moral standards imposed by public ordering may vary among firms. If \nthis is the case, sanctions had to be set at the cost level of the firm with the highest opportunity costs. \n \n7 Hence, on global markets, international regulation appears necessary for effectively enforcing moral \nminimum standards through public ordering. WTO agreements can aim at this. Still, negotiations \nregarding the \u2018substance\u2019 and \u2018height\u2019 of internationally agreed standards are likely to be difficult in view \nof (1) losses some nations suffer because of tightening regulation, (2) different cultural backgrounds which \ninfluence interpretations of what morality should amount to in market interactions, and (3) sanctioning \nproblems in the case agreed standards are violated by one nation. \n \n8 Dunfee (1998) discussed through the concept of \u2018passions of propriety\u2019 how moral dispositions of \nindividuals who interact with a firm can be approached. Vanberg (1988) or Gauthier (1986) proceeded \nsimilarly but more from an economic theoretical perspective. Vanberg, for example, critiqued a \nBeckerian framework when conceptualising morality as an explanatory variable of economic theory. \nThe present paper, in contrast, focuses on business ethics when conceptualising morality as an \nexplanatory variable of (business) behaviour \u2013 and here it is largely compatible with Becker\u2019s (1976; \n1993; 1996) constraints-based approach to human choice. \n \n9 Early on Simon\u2019s (1945) inducement-contribution analysis referred to customers and the capital \nmarket as disciplining influences (on efficiency standards) in an organisation; see also Hirschman \n(1970); Wagner-Tsukamoto (2003, Sections 2.3, 4.2). \n \n10 The idea of capital contributions to a firm can be detailed through a concept of \u2018quasi-property \nrights\u2019, that is rights which are not necessarily legally granted and institutionally protected but \nprimarily rest in economic power, e.g. a pressure group's capability to \u2018(de)-mobilize\u2019 a firm's \ncustomer base. Also, property rights assessments of ethical capital lead back to systemic \nconsiderations of public ordering. As for stock capital, human capital, brand capital, etc public \nordering may have to set regulatory standards regarding claims to ethical capital. For instance, initial \nproblems of firms to create and protect ethical capital regarding green products probably reflected that \npublic ordering regarding property rights in \u2018eco-capital\u2019 was inadequate (Wagner, 1997, pp. 3\u20134). \n  \n \n  \n 36\nThe emergence of \u2018officially\u2019 regulated ISO-schemes for assessing the environmental performance of \na firm, the certification of fair trading practices, etc. seemingly addresses this issue. \n \n11 In contrast, Boatright (2002) applies a rights-based approach to questions of stakeholder \nmanagement and stockholder management. Also, moral issues are neglected in his discussion. \nBoatright (1996) grounds stakeholder theory in a contractual approach and discusses on this basis \nbusiness ethics problems for the firm. The concept of ethical capital, as developed in the present \npaper, specifies certain types of contractual exchanges between firm and stakeholder, namely ones \nthat involve stakeholders who hold both economic assets and ethical preferences. \n  \n12 As already noted earlier, a further qualification applies in relation to transaction cost lowering \neffects of trust, reciprocity, and so on that is shown in market interactions. \n"}
