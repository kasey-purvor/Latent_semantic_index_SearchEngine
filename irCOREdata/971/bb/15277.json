Introduction \n1.1 Creativity \n \nCreativity has been described in many ways (Eysenck, 1996; Mayer, 1999). \nTreffinger, Young, Selby and Shepardson (2002) identified over one hundred \ndefinitions but a common theme is that creativity is a personal activity intended to \nproduce something new. For instance, Bergstr\u00f6m (1984) defines creativity as \n\u201cperformance where the individual is producing something new and unpredictable\u201d \n(as cited by Pehkonen, 1997, p. 159). Kwon, Park and Park (2006, p. 52) define \ncreativity as a \u201chigh-dimensional human ability or skill to think up something new\u201d. \nSimilarly, in the UK, the National Advisory Committee on Creative and Cultural \nEducation (NACCCE, 1999, p. 30) describes creativity as \u201cimaginative activity \nfashioned so as to produce outcomes that are both original and of value\u201d. This \nreference to \u201eoriginality\u201f and \u201evalue\u201f reminds us that there is an implicit social aspect \nof creativity as it is, in the final analysis, society (or some significant subset of it) \nwhich validates the product (Csikszentmihalyi, 1996; Plucker, Beghetto & Dow, \n2004). Not all mathematicians would agree with the need for practical \u201evalue\u201f in \ncreative work (see for example Sriraman, 2009a) and Cropley (2001) has added that \nthe product must be ethical. In essence, this means that what is acceptable and valued \ndepends on the context and the culture (Kwang, 2001). This meaning of creativity \nbegan to take shape in the nineteenth century in connection with artistic and poetic \nimagination and popular notions of the creative domain are still shaped by this \nassociation (Tatarkiewicz, 1980; Euster, 1987). The existence of creativity outside the \narts and, in particular, the many ways of being creative in mathematics did not attract \nmuch attention until more recent times (Treffinger et al., 2002).  \n1.2 Creativity in the mathematics classroom \nOne notion of mathematical creativity is the \u201egenius\u201f view where creative acts are \nseen as rare and produced quickly and effortlessly by extraordinary individuals \n(Weisberg, 1988). While there are people described as mathematically gifted, this \ndoes not mean that others are not also creative in mathematical ways (Sriraman, \n2005). Others argue that creative acts are associated with long periods of \nmathematical activity and reflection and the use of deep and flexible knowledge \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n  3 \n(Sternberg, 1988; Gruber & Wallace, 2000). Research suggests that the \nmathematically creative are not necessarily those who show high levels of \nachievement in school mathematics (Hong & Aqui, 2004). Creativity in mathematics \ncomes from more than a sound knowledge base; it comes from the ability to break \nfree from established mind-sets, to see possibilities beyond and to apply a broad range \nof mathematical knowledge in seeing opportunities (Cropley, 1992; Haylock, 1997; \nSriraman, 2009b).  \nIndeed, learning itself may be seen as a creative process in which meaning is \nconstructed by the learner (Von Glasersfeld, 1984; Lerman, 1990; Ernest, 1994). \nBoden (2004) usefully distinguishes between historical creativity which offers \nsomething novel to the world and psychological creativity which produces something \nthat is new to the person. On this basis, children are being creative in the mathematics \nclassroom when they produce something new to themselves, as when they construct \nmeaning for symbols, signs and operations, make sense of a mathematical problem, \ndevise a way of solving it, and think of a way of testing the reasonableness of the \nsolution (Haylock, 1987). Even very young children can be creative in this sense, as \nwhen a 4\u00bd year-old child felt the need for a symbol for a half and so depicted the \nfigure 4 and invented a representation of a half by adding a half of the 4 (Worthington \n& Carruthers, 2003; Carruthers & Worthington, 2005). Similarly, a child may create \nmeaning for 5 + 6 by analogy with the spots on dominoes, counting the dots to arrive \nat the sum. Children may similarly be creative when they split a problem into sub-\nproblems and formulate a plan to work through them. A mathematics student may \nalso construct meaning in grasping for the first time why some standard algorithm \nworks and invent a variant of that algorithm or improve it (Haylock, 1987).  \nTo summarise, creative opportunities in the mathematics classroom are in, for \nexample, the need for mathematical expression and communication, the construction \nof meaning and development of personal understandings, the generation of ways of \nsolving problems, hypothesising about mathematical situations and outcomes, \nconstructing tests of those hypotheses, and in formulating plans for solving complex \nproblems. Mann (2006) usefully discusses and relates some of these in his study of \nindicators of mathematical creativity. He also sums up the way in which, all too often, \nmathematics teaching stifles creativity in schools and suggests a way forward: \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n  4 \n \nFrequently, all students, including those who met or exceeded the test \ngoals, simply receive more of the same methods of instruction that yielded \nthe results under examination. If mathematical talent is to be discovered \nand developed, changes in classroom practices and curricular materials are \nnecessary. These changes will only be effective if creativity in \nmathematics is allowed to be part of the educational experience. (Mann, \n2006, p. 237) \nThere is a concern to provide this experience in the UK (where creative thought is \noften described as a thinking-, key- or life-skill (SEED, 2006)) and in many other \nparts of the world (e.g. Diakidoy & Kanari, 1999; Tan, 2000; Kwon et al., 2006; \nMann, 2006). This concern is not, however, universal as creativity may not be \nconsidered to be a desirable trait in all cultures (Kwang, 2001). The perceived value \nof creativity stems from its potential to contribute to personal effectiveness, culture \nand the economy (NACCCE, 1999; QCA\/DfEE, 1999). More fundamentally, \ncreativity can contribute to personal independence, autonomy and the ability to cope \nin new situations (Craft, 2002; NACCCE, 1999). In classrooms, it is claimed that \ncreativity can improve behaviour, social skills, self-esteem, motivation and \nachievement (QCA, 2003, 2005; Ofsted, 2006). Against this background, the DfES \n(2003) in the UK urges primary teachers to foster creativity and problem-solving \nskills. There is also a clear distinction in the literature between \u201eteaching for \ncreativity\u201f in children and \u201eteaching creatively\u201f by the teacher (NACCCE, 1999). \nHere, concern is with teaching which might foster children\u201fs creativity in mathematics \n(A useful collection of relevant articles can be found in Sriraman, 2008). \n1.3 Teachers\u2019 conceptions of creativity \n \nAiken (1973) argues that the teacher is the key to creative thinking in the classroom. \nAt the general level, teachers\u201f notions of creativity are very similar in various parts of \nthe world. For instance, Fryer and Collings (1991) found that UK teachers see \ncreativity as producing original, independent work. Similar beliefs were found \namongst Swedish and Cypriot teachers (Bjerstedt, 1976; Diakidoy & Kanari, 1999). \nRunco and Johnson (2002) studied parents\u201f and teachers\u201f beliefs about the traits of \ncreative children in the USA and in India. They found that both agreed that creative \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n  5 \nchildren are artistic, imaginative and inventive. However, some subjects are seen as \noffering fewer opportunities for creativity than others and mathematics is often \nconsidered to be one of them (Pehkonen, 1997; Davies, Howe, Rogers & Fasciato, \n2004). Teachers of young children claim to believe mathematics is creative in the \nclassroom but closer inspection shows that they refer to the opportunities mathematics \nsessions provide for creative activities in construction, art, and songs and rhymes \nrather than in mathematics itself (Worthington & Carruthers, 2003; Carruthers & \nWorthington, 2005). Teachers of older children may routinely dismiss creative \nthought (Kennedy, 2005), particularly in subjects like mathematics where they may \nsee the acquisition of algorithms as paramount and creativity as a distraction \n(Beghetto, 2007). \n \nWhether such beliefs are important in shaping practice depends on the context and \nspecificity of the conception in that context. Some studies have found little \nrelationship between teachers\u201f conceptions of the nature of mathematics and their \nteaching (e.g. Schraw & Olafson, 2002). Others find that such beliefs shape classroom \nstrategies (e.g. Lerman, 1983; Thompson, 1984; Hofer & Pintrich, 1997). The link \nbetween teachers\u201f conceptions of mathematics and their practices is neither direct nor \nsimple but is mediated by the pressure to cover content, a lack of teaching experience, \npreferred teaching approaches and student reactions to them (Fryer & Collings, 1991; \nAskew, Brown, Rhodes, Johnson & William, 1997; Bolden, 2006). Furthermore, \nwhen teachers\u201f conceptions are accessed at the general level, broad views of the world \nmay be too vague to shape planning and teaching. But, when accessed at a level that \nties it to classroom practices, there can be a closer relationship between conceptions \nand teaching (e.g. Strauss, 1993; Beswick, 2004). Strauss (1993) points out that \nteachers need to consider such beliefs and, if necessary, address them. On this basis, \nteachers\u201f conceptions can matter and knowledge of them has the potential to be useful \nto teacher trainers. \n1.4 Aims \n \nIt is not enough for a teacher to know what constitutes creativity in general. Like \nunderstanding, the nature of creativity varies with the subject so teachers need to \nknow what constitutes creative thought in a particular context if they are to foster and \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n  6 \nassess mathematical creativity in a systematic and deliberate way (Newton, 2000). \nThis study aimed simply to explore and document pre-service teachers\u201f conceptions \nof creativity in mathematics, particularly in relation to primary school mathematics. \nThe purpose was to comment on how appropriate these conceptions are for teaching \nmathematics at the primary level (i.e. to 5 to 11-year-old children) and ultimately \ninform thinking about pre-service teacher education in this context.  \n \n2. Method \n \nAt the beginning of their course (see below) pre-service teachers were asked to \ncomplete a questionnaire\n\uf02a\n to elicit their conceptions about creativity in primary \nmathematics. The questionnaire used both closed (with a Likert scale) and open-ended \nitems. For an example of the latter, \u201cCould you give an example of a mathematics \nlesson you have observed which demonstrated creativity? Try to say what was \ncreative about it\u201d. The questionnaire responses provided the initial data pool. \n \nClosely following the phenomenographic procedure for identifying conceptions of \nlived experiences devised by Marton (1981), responses in the data pool describing \nteaching behaviours considered by the respondents to be creative were sorted into \ngroups. This sort was iterative, particularly at the outset when groups may be \nabandoned, refined or replaced until they reflect a particular kind of teaching \nbehaviour.  \n \nFor example, the responses \u201cfractions, as it is often a topic children find difficult but \nit can be related to pizza slices\u201d and \u201cIt\u201fs much easier when it comes to space, shape \nand measures because you can get kids to be creative through doing practical \nthings\u2026\u201d led to the initial group representing the category called, tentatively, areas of \nmathematics. As later responses were added, e.g. \u201cmeasuring data \u2013 can get children \nto physically undertake investigations \u2013 using scales, measuring lengths\/widths of \nobjects in classroom\u201d, this led to the renaming of the category as pupils undertake \npractical activities and investigations. Similarly, the category teachers\u201f imaginative \nuse of resources and technology was identified from a number of responses including \n                                                 \n\uf02a\n The full questionnaire is available from the lead author at d.s.bolden@durham.ac.uk. \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n  7 \n\u201cmaths bingo for learning the 6 times table. A more interactive and fun way of \nlearning tables\u201d and \u201cchildren were working with shapes such as hexagons, circles, \npentagons and triangles\u2026\u201d but again as more responses were analysed this category \nwas considered to be inadequate and another category was identified, teachers apply \nmathematics to everyday examples. This and teachers\u201f imaginative use of resources \nand technology then became sub-categories of a larger category called creativity as \ncreative teaching. Ultimately, from the entire data pool, self-consistent and mutually \nexclusive groups evolved.  \n \nEach group was given a descriptive label, its attributes were listed and the group was \nexemplified to form a \u201ecategory of description\u201f. Each category described a conception \nof creativity (for a full account, see Marton, 1981). It cannot be said, however, that the \nlist of categories is exhaustive: interviews with other pre-service teachers may add to \nit and it should not be assumed that other conceptions do not exist amongst other pre-\nservice teachers. In practice, this is not an obstacle to using the results to inform \ndiscussion about certain questions relating to pre-service teachers\u201f conceptions.  \n \nFollow-up interviews with a volunteer sample of ten pre-service teachers allowed us \nto check our interpretations and explore these responses further through such \nquestions as, \u201cIn your examples of mathematics lessons in which children would be \ncreative, what would the children do that was creative?\u201d \u201cIs there another way \nchildren might be creative in mathematics?\u201d Most interviews lasted approximately \ntwenty minutes and had a quality control purpose and elicited, for instance, views on \nthe accuracy of the interviewer\u201fs perceptions of their beliefs, specific instances of \nmathematics lessons believed to provide opportunities for children to be creative in \nmathematics, clarification of what children did that pre-service teachers considered \ncreative, and what was seen to be worthy of high (or low) marks for creativity in these \nlessons. The interviews were conducted individually, after the analysis of the data \npool, and on two consecutive days toward the end of their course. \n2.1 The sample \n \nThe questionnaire was completed by a convenience sample of thirty-eight pre-service \nteachers on a 38-week postgraduate teaching course. The interviews sample \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n  8 \ncomprised ten volunteers who had previously completed the questionnaire. The \ninterviews were conducted towards the end of their course as this was convenient for \nthe pre-service teachers and the purpose was not intended to track change over time. \n \nThe course caters for those wishing to qualify to teach in primary schools in the UK \nand who already hold an undergraduate degree. As qualified primary teachers they are \nexpected to teach across the curriculum in English primary schools (5-11 year-old) \nand had followed a broad course covering the range of subjects generally taught in \nEngland at that level and which included generic instruction on lesson planning (but \nno specific instruction on support for creativity). Over the duration of the course, \nthese pre-service teachers had observed, planned and taught lessons for some twenty-\none weeks in local primary schools. This included a significant amount of \nmathematics teaching, often on a daily basis. They were quickly expected to plan \nlessons without detailed support. Although the course population tends to be an \nacademically able group only one had an undergraduate degree in mathematics and \nmany tend to have concerns about their mathematical subject knowledge. Thus the \nsample comprised mainly \u201enon-specialists\u201f in mathematics as the majority had not \nstudied mathematics beyond the GCSE\/GCE \u201eO\u201f levelii. In this respect the pre-service \nteachers in this sample can be described as typical of many other primary school pre-\nservice and practising teachers in the UK. \n \nThe aim of the mathematics element of the course is to develop an understanding of \nthe subject knowledge relevant to teaching 5-11 year olds. It emphasised the \nimportance of the connections between mental representations of any mathematical \nconcept (see for example Harries & Barmby, 2007). The course involved no \ninstruction about mathematical creativity. \n \n3. Results \n \nWe present the findings from the questionnaire and interviews together, first in broad \nterms and then by reference to the conceptions held by the pre-service teachers. The \nrationale for this combined presentation is that we viewed the questionnaire responses \nas providing the bulk of the data pool with the interviews providing useful \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n  9 \nsupplementary data. That is, the interviews allowed the authors to access pre-service \nteachers\u201f conceptions from a different angle and verify that their questionnaire \nresponses were being interpreted as they were meant. \n3.1 Some background beliefs \n \nThe responses to the questionnaire indicated that most pre-service teachers believed \nthat mathematics was not a creative subject (a median response of 2 from a 5-point, \nLikert-scale where 1 is not very creative and 5 is very creative). There was also the \nview that it was difficult to encourage creativity in mathematics (a median response of \n4). Given this, it was not surprising to find that other subjects, such as English, Art \nand even Science were seen by pre-service teachers as offering more opportunities for \ncreativity. In general, these subjects were perceived to offer much more scope for \n\u201ediscussion and exploration of ideas\u201f, \u201efreedom of choice\u201f, involved greater use of \n\u201ethe imagination\u201f, had \u201efewer set goals\u201f or \u201eno correct answer\u201f.  \n3.2 Pre-service teachers\u2019 views about creativity in mathematics \n \nDrawing on responses to the questionnaire and also in the interviews, pre-service \nteachers had a number of conceptions of creativity in mathematics classrooms.  These \nwere eventually organised into broad categories related to teaching, learning and \nassessment. The sections below discuss these categories and associated sub-categories \nand Table 1. gives details of their prevalence within the sample of pre-service \nteachers. \n \n3.2.1 Creativity as creative teaching \n \nThere were essentially two sub-categories that matched pre-service teachers\u201f \ncomments within this broad area.  Firstly, creativity was viewed in terms of the \nresources that were used to teach mathematical topics \u2013 both the types of resources \nused and the way in which they were used. Secondly they discussed creativity in \nterms of the way in which real life examples were used to explore mathematical \nconcepts. \n \nTeachers\u201f imaginative use of resources and technology \n \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n  10 \nThis view saw creativity in the primary mathematics classroom as residing \npredominantly in the teacher rather than in the pupil. One aspect of this creativity was \nbound up with teachers\u201f use of a variety of different resources. The use of resources \nhere seems to be related to the pupils having fun with little real consideration of the \nway in which the resource might enhance the learning of mathematical concepts. For \ninstance, below are three examples of responses to the questionnaire item which asked \npre-service teachers to provide an example of a mathematics lesson which they had \nobserved and which they believed demonstrated creativity. \n \nMaths bingo for learning the 6 times table. A more interactive and fun way of \nlearning tables. The teacher used the interactive whiteboard. \n \nChildren were working with shapes such as hexagons, circles, pentagons and \ntriangles. The teacher gave them the task of making a picture out of their shapes, \ne.g. spaceships, Christmas trees. The children had to name the shapes they used. \n \nThere are a lot more resources in school now. There weren\u201ft dice at school [in \nmy day], there weren\u201ft number fans, there weren\u201ft the interactive whiteboard \nwith all the resources that has on it, you know, the countdown games, the silly \nthings, but they really do make a difference \u2026 it makes maths more exciting. \n \nHere it is clear that \u201cfun\u201d is paramount in the pre-service teachers\u201f minds.  There is \nlittle if any view that the resources themselves could be used to represent concepts in \ndifferent ways and possibly give young learners better access to ideas. Further it is \nimportant to recognise that resources have specific uses. For example whilst number \nfans are an excellent resource for helping young learners see how numbers are built \nup in our denary system, they are difficult to use to perform calculations on numbers. \nFor this, other resources are valuable. Thus, there is a need to understand the \nlimitations of the resource being used. \n \nTeachers apply mathematics to everyday examples \n \nThe second sub-category here was seen as the teachers\u201f ability to apply mathematical \ntopics to a variety of everyday examples. One pre-service teacher described it as, \n\u201efinding a hook\u201f with which to grab the pupils\u201f interest. \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n  11 \n \nI think it\u201fs about finding a hook, find something that\u201fs interesting to the children \nlike I had one child who was only interested in fishing so if you could relate \nanything to fishing he could do it and if you couldn\u201ft, he couldn\u201ft do it, he had a \nsort of mental block. So I was making up these ridiculous questions about how \nmany carp are there in a pond, just tailoring the question to their interests, using \nyour creativity to interest them. \n \nHere it could be said that the pre-service teacher is recognising the need for context \nwhen learning mathematics. This is an important consideration but it is also necessary \nto understand the range of contexts within which the young learner can give meaning \nto mathematical concepts. Some may be real contexts such as the one mentioned but it \nis also possible to develop contexts which are more abstract such as puzzle contexts \nwhich would allow the learner to explore an idea. \n \n3.2.2 Creativity in learning \n \nThe second broad area identified by the pre-service teachers concerned the way in \nwhich young learners constructed their own learning. There were two sub-categories \nhere \u2013 the type of activity experienced and the development of flexibility in \nperforming calculations. \n \nPupils undertake practical activities and investigations \n \nCreativity here is seen as pupils undertaking practical activities and investigations in \nthe classroom. In these activities there are no set ways of working and so young \nlearners are able to develop their own methods for approaching problems and are \nencouraged to explore ideas rather than just seek an answer. Certain mathematical \ntopics were perceived by pre-service teachers to offer more opportunities for creative \nlearning in this respect. For example, shape, space and measures, fractions, division, \ndata gathering, were all identified as opportunities for pupil creativity in learning, e.g.  \n \nMeasuring data \u2013 can get children to physically undertake investigations \u2013 using \nscales, measuring lengths\/widths of objects in classroom. \n \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n  12 \nFractions, as it is often a topic children find difficult but it can be related to \npizza slices.  \n \nIt\u201fs much easier when it comes to space, shape and measures because you can \nget kids to be creative through doing practical things whereas when it comes to \nusing the four operations it becomes harder to develop creativity. \n \nThese comments show the pre-service teacher view that active learning is to be \nencouraged but again it could be questioned as to how clear they are about the way in \nwhich the activities can help to give meaning to concepts. For example whilst pizza \nslices might help to illustrate the \u201cpart-whole\u201d idea of fractions, whether it can be \nextended to help young learners to see fractions as numbers and whether it helps to \ngive meaning to calculations with fractions is unclear.  \n \nPupils develop computational flexibility \n \nCreativity here is seen as pupils\u201f ability to develop flexibility in their computational \nmethods. However, the origin of this aspect of creativity was much less clear, That is, \nalthough pre-service teachers saw this flexibility as representing creativity in pupils, \ni.e. creative learning, they also saw it as representing creativity in teachers, i.e. \ncreative teaching (See creativity as creative teaching above). This overlap can be \ndiscerned from the following comments: \n \nIt\u201fs about giving them a variety of different ways of approaching different \nconcepts, not to just go down the one route but giving them different ways of \nworking something out so that they can understand the concepts from different \nangles, so they can approach them and have a bit of background knowledge to \nsay \u201ewell, I can\u201ft do it that way but I can do it this way\u201f. \n \nI think it has to come from the teacher but from my point of view it\u201fs about the \nteacher encouraging the students to be creative in their maths. I mean I\u201fve been \nworking with Year 2 children and it\u201fs about getting them to use different methods \nand finding out which is best for them, and get the right answer doing that, as \nlong as they can do it, that\u201fs the key. \n \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n  13 \nHere we can see the pre-service teachers moving away from a purely answer-based \nview of mathematics with a specific algorithm learnt in order to obtain this answer.  \nThey are encouraging the young learners to see mathematics as more open and that \nthe way in which calculations are performed is at least as interesting as the answer. \nThis orientation suggests that pre-service teachers saw flexibility as a key element of \ncreativity. \n \nTable 1. Number of pre-service teachers holding identified conceptions of creativity. \n \nCategories and subcategories of conceptions N \nCreativity as creative teaching: \na) Teachers\u201f creative use of resources. \nb) Teachers apply mathematics to everyday examples. \n27 \n17 \n10 \nCreativity as creative learning: \na) Pupils undertake practical activities and investigations. \nb) Pupils develop computational flexibility. \n18 \n12 \n6 \n \n3.2.3 Creativity and assessment \n \nResults from the questionnaire showed that all but one of the pre-service teachers \n(N=37) thought encouraging creativity in primary mathematics classrooms was \ngenerally a difficult thing to do. Interviews showed that pre-service teachers found it \ndifficult to be explicit about identifying and categorising creativity in the classroom.  \n \nI think it would be quite hard \u2026 maybe just being a little bit different, hmm \u2026 \nit\u201fs quite difficult! Perhaps if you saw a child really engaged in the activity and \ntrying to work their way through it but also a little bit \u2026 different. \n \nThey\u201fd have to show their working out and the structure and how they\u201fd done it. \n \nIt would be easier if you had the children from the word go. For instance, I\u201fve \nbeen teaching Year 2 children and when they come into Year 2 they have already \nbeen taught \u201ethis is how you do addition\u201f or \u201ethis is what addition is\u201f and they \nthink there is only one to do it and you have to think, well how else could you do \nit. \n \nIn order that children can be creative in the classroom they first need to be presented \nwith opportunities to display their creativity. For instance, activities need to be \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n  14 \ndesigned that allow the young learners to be creative and to have opportunities to \ncommunicate their findings.  Further, the way we think about assessment needs to \ndevelop so that the mechanisms we use for assessment are appropriate.  \n \nAn assessment system predicated on a behaviouristic view of teaching and learning is \none that is currently used in the centralised National Curriculum for England (DfES, \n1999). Assessment of learning by paper-and-pencil, \u201eobjective\u201f tests, with the aim of \ndetermining how much of the core curriculum has been learned from the teacher, is \nstill an important part of the National Curriculum in England. Shepard (1991, 2002) \nargues that this measurement approach to classroom assessment reflected by \nstandardised tests and teacher-made emulations of those tests is essentially \nincompatible with the central ideas underpinning constructivism and only serves as a \nbarrier to the implementation of the ideas of constructivism. This scientific \nmeasurement approach is more theoretically consistent with earlier forms of the \ncurriculum and their associated beliefs about learning, e.g. rationalism and \nbehaviourism. \n \nIf assessment practices are to be better able to assess creativity then we need to get \ncreative in the ways we assess. That is, creative assessment is likely to require \nchildren to illustrate their mathematical understanding and this will require very \ndifferent modes of assessment than we currently have in operation in England. When \nknowing is viewed as an understanding of the overarching principles of a subject \ndomain rather than the ability to produce algorithmic answers then assessment \npractices will need to assess that understanding across a wider range of the domain, \nwhich means assessments will need to be larger in their scope. For instance, some \nalternative assessments that are being devised in the United States include larger \nprojects that may take several days or weeks to complete (Greeno, Collins & Resnick, \n1996). More recently Cropley (2001) has argued that recent work in assessing \ncreativity suggests it is far less difficult to assess than one might think. \n \n3.2.4 Narrow conceptions of mathematics and its creativity \n \nQuestionnaire responses suggested that pre-service teachers held narrow, absolutist \nviews of mathematics as a subject. That is, the data suggested that most (N=31) \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n  15 \nconceived mathematics as a subject as a set body of knowledge which offered little or \nno room for freedom of expression, imagination, and independence.  \n \nI don\u201ft feel [mathematics] is creative in the way that Art or English or Music \nare; it is not easy to express yourself in maths.  \n \n[Mathematics] is all facts, figures, and definite answers. No personal element. \n \nThis was corroborated later in interviews. That is, all the pre-service teachers \ninterviewed admitted that they had not viewed mathematics as a creative subject. \n \nBefore commencing this course, I would have said that maths was not creative at \nall. \n \nMaths does not seem to be creative. It deals more with numbers, calculations, \nand problem-solving. Much of maths seems to be based on rules. \n \nMoreover, these narrow conceptions of mathematics were thought to be an inevitable \nresult of the way in which pre-service teachers experienced mathematics during their \nown schooling, which was often laden with negative feelings.  \n \nI didn\u201ft view mathematics as creative at school. I hated it actually\u2026because of \nthe teacher approach, to be honest. He didn\u201ft really want to be there, he rattled \nthrough it regardless of whether you understood it or not, he would move on to \nthe next section and I\u201fd think \u201eI haven\u201ft understood that yet\u201f. \n \nIn my school the emphasis was firmly on the Arts rather than maths and science. \nI knew it was important but it was mostly just chalk and talk and rote learning \nand I never felt like I understood maths. I could do it but I worked hard and \nliterally learnt all the formulae, because I\u201fve got a great memory, and I\u201fd \nregurgitate it onto the exam paper so I always did okay but hand on heart I\u201fd \nhave to say I didn\u201ft really understand it, even now there\u201fs things I don\u201ft \nunderstand. \n \nIt was just textbook, textbook, textbook all the way through primary school, and \nsecondary school. The answers were in the back\u2026the teacher displayed them \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n  16 \nand then it was textbook and check your own answers and then move on to the \nnext. That was secondary school but primary school was very similar, it was very \nlimited\u2026but I used to love maths. \n \nThese experiences inevitably shaped pre-service teachers\u201f views of creativity within \nmathematics. It is not surprising then that pre-service teachers also felt that \nmathematics was not a creative subject and that all but one of them felt there were \nother subjects more amenable to creativity. Consequently, pre-service teachers\u201f views \nof creativity were very much arts-based with English, art, music, dance, and design \nand technology being identified as much more creative subjects than mathematics. \n \nMaths is pretty regimented, you either get a right answer or you get a wrong \nanswer, so that cuts it very short but if you are given something in dance or PE \nyou can create your own dance or rhythm whereas it\u201fs difficult to get that \nfreedom of expression in maths\u2026at the end there\u201fs always a right answer. \n \nAlthough the timing of the interviews was not designed to measure change in pre-\nservice teachers\u201f conceptions of creativity the data suggested that their conceptions of \nmathematics and of creativity within it had widened since completing the \nquestionnaire earlier in the course.  \n \nNow I know that maths is much more for understanding than for knowing and \nwhilst you can still teach children the old, conventional ways it\u201fs nice to be able \nto offer them a couple of solutions, you know, to solve a mathematical problem. \nYes, I think now it\u201fs a lot more creative. \n \nI think you have to try and get children involved. You just can\u201ft sit them in front \nof a textbook all day but they also need that solid knowledge \u2026 so they definitely \nknow what they are doing. So in that sense, it has changed.  I did think it was \nreally regimented but now I think it is more creative than I first thought. \n \nNow that I\u201fve done the course and seen things from the teacher\u201fs perspective I \nwould say that mathematics can be much more creative, it just needs the right \nperson to make it creative. I saw scope for creativity in maths before but I see \nmuch more scope for it now, there is much more happening now to develop \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n  17 \ncreativity than when I was at school so my vision of mathematics as a creative \nsubject has definitely increased since I\u201fve come on the course. \n \nThis was not intended to be a longitudinal study of conceptual change in pre-service \nteachers. Nevertheless, we have shown that our pre-service teachers\u201f conceptions of \nmathematical creativity were still limited as they prepared to enter their first teaching \nposts. This is evidenced by their inability to be explicit about what mathematical \ncreativity might look like in the primary classroom beyond their tendency to associate \ncreativity with the teacher\u201fs use of resources and technology. \n \n4. Discussion \n \nThis research identifies categories of pre-service teacher conceptions of creativity in \nprimary mathematics but we do not suggest that they represent an exhaustive \ntaxonomy. It is possible that pre-service teachers not in this sample would hold \ndifferent conceptions. Furthermore, the sample is small and self-selected so while the \nprevalence of particular conceptions is interesting, we can only speculate about the \nrelative prevalence of the conceptions in the general population of pre-service \nteachers. Despite this limitation, the pre-service teachers described here are typical of \nmany other primary school pre-service teachers in the UK. For instance, most had not \nstudied mathematics beyond GCSE\/GCE \u201eO\u201f level. Consequently, teacher educators \nare likely to be able to relate the findings described here readily to their own pre-\nservice teachers\u201f conceptions (see Bassey (2001) for the concept of relatability of \nresearch results). \n \nThere was evidence that creativity in the broad sense was viewed as others tend to \nview it. That is, there was reference made to \u201efreedom of expression\u201f, \u201eimagination\u201f, \n\u201eindependence\u201f, which suggested an expectation of originality. These pre-service \nteachers also saw creativity as centred more on the arts which parallels the findings of \nDiakidoy and Kanari (1999) and Davies et al., (2004). This resonance gives some \nconfidence that the term was being understood as others understand it. Nevertheless, \nbroad brush conceptions may bear little upon practice. What is more likely to count is \nhow these are interpreted, if at all, in the specific context of the classroom.  \n \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n  18 \nIn this respect, several conceptions were identified: \nCreativity originated in the teacher before the pupil. Pre-service teachers felt that \nteachers as the expert adults and the orchestrators of the pupils\u201f experience needed to \nhave a creative approach to mathematics that they could share with the pupils. \nOtherwise the pupils would tend to adopt a more staid approach. \n \nCreativity was bound up with the use of resources and new technology (teaching \ncreatively rather than teaching for creativity). Here the pre-service teachers seemed to \nthink of the use of resources in terms of creating a \u201cfun\u201d environment. Clearly this is \nan appropriate approach but it needs to be developed further so that the pre-service \nteacher is aware of the pedagogical potential of different resources for giving young \nlearners access to mathematical ideas. \n \nAlthough there was a general consensus that creativity ought to be encouraged in \nprimary mathematics there was also a degree of uncertainty about how one might do \nthat in the classroom. This emanated very much from the pre-service teachers\u201f own \nschool experience of mathematics which tended to be somewhat unimaginative.  But \nthere was also a feeling that they did not want to perpetuate this view and were keen \nto develop more open approaches to mathematics \u2013 even if they were not clear what \nthis might mean for their own learning. \n \nAlso, pre-service teachers generally found it difficult to suggest ways of assessing \ncreativity in mathematics in the classroom. The difficulty here seemed to be that they \nwere thinking in terms of old assessment methods whereas if we are to assess such \nskills as creativity we need to think afresh about assessment mechanisms and how \nthey can be appropriately developed.  \n \nThe findings discussed here suggest that the meaning of creativity in primary \nmathematics is unlikely to be well understood by beginning pre-service teachers. This \nsituation is likely to be amenable to improvement if the meaning of creativity in \nmathematics is explicitly explored. Teacher educators are likely to meet both \nmisconceptions and narrow conceptions of creativity in mathematics. Furthermore, a \ntendency to associate creativity with the arts may inhibit thought about it in other \ncontexts. Consequently, teacher educators may need to give creativity in mathematics \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n  19 \nmuch more explicit attention so that such weaknesses are addressed and confronted \n(Strauss, 1993; Tillema, 1997). \n \n5. Conclusion \n \nAlthough we have seen a recognition of the importance of supporting creativity in \nprimary-aged school children in England and Wales (DfES, 2003), creativity has not \nalways received much attention in teacher education in the UK (Davies et al., 2004) \nand elsewhere (Diakidoy & Kanari, 1999). In the context of mathematics education, \na general tendency to see mathematics as the acquisition of algorithms (Kennedy, \n2005; Beghetto, 2007) and to associate creativity with the arts may incline pre-service \nteachers and newly qualified teachers to neglect it in mathematics, particularly when \nthey also struggle to understand how it may work in the classroom. These pre-service \nteachers found it difficult to be specific about encouraging and assessing creativity in \nmathematics lessons. A worst-case scenario would involve newly qualified teachers \nentering the classroom unable to recognise creativity, ultimately discouraging those \ncreative pupils from pursuing mathematics or, at least, from being mathematically \ncreative. \n \nIt is important then that pre-service teachers develop adequate conceptions of \nmathematical creativity and of creativity as it may appear in the classroom if \nmathematics teaching is to improve in this respect. However, programmes of pre-\nservice teacher education may have to be much more explicit in exploring what it \nmeans to be creative in primary mathematics if newly qualified teachers are to meet \nthe government\u201fs expectation and develop creativity in their mathematics classrooms.  \n \n \nAcknowledgements The authors would like to thank the reviewers of an earlier draft \nof this paper and the useful comments and references they supplied. \n \n \n_____________________________________________ \n \ni\n   In the United Kingdom, pre-service teachers are referred to as \u201etrainee\u201f teachers. \nii\n  One trainee stated that there was no subject more creative than mathematics.
