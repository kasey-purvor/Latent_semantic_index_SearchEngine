Tissue and blood samples were collected 23 \nfrom trout at intervals up to 648 h after transfer to a standardised confinement stressor, 24 \ntogether with matched samples from undisturbed control fish. Plasma ACTH, cortisol, 25 \nglucose and lactate were analysed to confirm that the neuroendocrine response to 26 \nconfinement was consistent with previous findings and to provide a phenotypic context to 27 \nassist interpretation of gene expression data. Liver samples for suppression subtractive 28 \nhybridization (SSH) library construction were selected from within the experimental 29 \ngroups comprising \"early\" stress (2-48h) and \"late\" stress (96-504h). In order to reduce 30 \nredundancy within the four SSH libraries and yield a higher number of unique clones an 31 \nadditional subtraction was carried out. After printing of the arrays a series of 55 32 \nhybridisations were executed to cover 6 time-points. At 2h, 6h, 24h, 168h and 504h 5 33 \nindividual confined fish and 5 individual control fish were used with control fish only at 34 \n0h. A preliminary list of 314 clones considered differentially regulated over the complete 35 \ntime course was generated by a combination of data analysis approaches and the most 36 \nsignificant gene expression changes were found to occur during the 24h to 168h time 37 \nperiod with a general approach to control levels by 504h. Few changes in expression were 38 \napparent over the first 6h. The list of genes whose expression was significantly 39 \naltered comprised predominantly genes belonging to the biological process category 40 \n(response to stimulus) and one cellular component category (extracellular region) and 41 \nwere dominated by so-called acute phase proteins. Analysis of the gene expression profile 42 \n 3\nin liver tissue during confinement revealed a number of significant clusters. The major 43 \npatterns comprised genes that were up-regulated at 24 h and beyond, the primary 44 \nexamples being haptoglobin, \u03b2-fibrinogen and EST10729. Two representative genes from 45 \neach of the six k-means clusters were validated by qPCR. Correlations between 46 \nmicroarray and qPCR expression patterns were significant for most of the genes tested. 47 \nqPCR analysis revealed that haptoglobin expression was up-regulated approximately 8-48 \nfold at 24 h and over 13-fold by 168 h..  49 \n 50 \n 51 \n 52 \nKeywords: rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, stress, microarray, gene expression  53 \n 4\n1. Introduction 54 \nThe vertebrate stress response is a highly conserved suite of neuroendocrine, 55 \nphysiological and behavioural adjustments that, when evoked, enhance the individuals 56 \nlikelihood of survival when exposed to destabilising and challenging circumstances 57 \n(Johnson et al., 1992). The stress response in fish has been the subject of much interest, 58 \nnot only in an evolutionary and comparative context, but also because of the perceived 59 \nimpact of stress on the welfare and productivity of aquacultured fish (Pottinger and 60 \nPickering, 1997). Aquacultured fish species are essentially non-domesticated (Price, 61 \n1999; Vandeputte and Launey, 2004), few generations removed from the wild type, and 62 \ntherefore respond inappropriately to relatively benign events that occur unavoidably 63 \nwithin the aquaculture environment, such as routine husbandry procedures, transport and 64 \nrelated activities. They may also be adversely affected by holding conditions that impose 65 \nlevels of inter-individual interaction or other behavioural conditions that are at odds with 66 \nthe normal life-history requirements of the species (Huntingford, 2004). Where activation 67 \nof the stress response is intermittent or prolonged the adverse outcomes for growth, 68 \nreproductive function and immunocompetence are well-documented (Bonga, 1997).  69 \n 70 \nSelective breeding of aquacultured fish to improve economically important traits such as 71 \nfecundity and growth rate is an established practice (Gjoen and Bentsen, 1997; Hulata, 72 \n2001). There is now increasing effort being directed at evaluating the feasibility of 73 \nselective breeding for a reduced stress response, as a means to improve performance 74 \nacross a range of traits (Pottinger, 2000; Pottinger and Carrick, 1999; Wang et al., 2004). 75 \nIn order for this approach to become practicable, we require a greater understanding of 76 \n 5\nthe genetic basis of the stress response than is currently available - relying solely on 77 \nphenotypic performance markers is imprecise \u2013 and we require genetic markers of 78 \ndesirable stress-related traits.  79 \n 80 \nThe aim of the present study was to utilise a purpose-designed microarray platform to 81 \ninvestigate the changes in gene expression that occur within a single tissue, the liver, in 82 \nrainbow trout during prolonged exposure to stressful conditions. A well-established non-83 \ninvasive model stressor, prolonged confinement (Pottinger and Pickering, 1992), was 84 \nused to elicit a neuroendocrine stress response in adult rainbow trout and a range of 85 \nphenotypic endpoints was measured to provide a contextual basis for the interpretation of 86 \nthe microarray data. Analysis of gene expression in the liver tissue of the stressed fish 87 \nwas addressed by: (1) constructing a series of cDNA libraries enriched for genes 88 \ndifferentially regulated during stress; (2) applying cDNA microarray technology to 89 \ninvestigate the global response of the liver to the stressor, and (3) seeking to identify 90 \ngenes and processes that might ultimately provide markers of stress responsiveness.  91 \n 92 \n2. Materials and Methods 93 \n2.1 Experimental animals 94 \nTen days prior to the start of the study 360 adult rainbow trout (CEH 2000, unselected, 95 \nmixed-sex; mean weight \u00b1 SEM: 236 \u00b1 4.3 g) were distributed evenly between 20 96 \nholding tanks (18 fish\/tank). Each tank (circular, glassfibre, 1000 l) was supplied with a 97 \nconstant flow of lake water (25 l\/min) at ambient temperature. Prior to the start of the 98 \ntime-course study the fish were fed commercial food (Skretting Standard Expanded 40) at 99 \n 6\nthe manufacturers recommended rate. During the study food was withheld from both the 100 \ncontrol and confined fish because of the potentially confounding effects of stress-induced 101 \nappetite suppression. 102 \n 103 \n2.2 Protocol for confinement stress 104 \nTwelve fish from each of ten of the holding tanks were transferred by dip net to pairs of 105 \nconfinement tanks (6 fish\/tank, 50 l capacity, 15 l\/min flow through) at intervals. The 106 \ntransfers were carried out at appropriate intervals to allow the sampling and processing of 107 \nfish at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 24, 48, 96, 168, 336, 504 and 648 h after the onset of confinement. In 108 \naddition, at each of these time-points 6 fish each from two of the ten remaining 109 \nundisturbed holding tanks were sampled, providing 12 stressed and 12 control fish, from 110 \nduplicate holding tanks\/confinement tanks, at each time point. This protocol necessitated 111 \nthe repeated sampling of control tanks, however the interval between successive episodes 112 \nof disturbance was considered to be of sufficient duration, and the degree of disturbance 113 \nso minor, as not to impinge on the results of the study. 114 \n 115 \n2.3 Sample collection and tissue processing 116 \nAt each sample point, 6 fish were netted rapidly from the holding\/confinement tank and 117 \ntransferred to an anaesthetic\/sedative solution (2-phenoxyethanol; 1:2000; Sigma-118 \nAldrich). Blood samples were collected from the caudal vessels into syringes, then the 119 \nfish were weighed, measured and killed by spinal section. Each syringe contained EDTA 120 \n(1.5 mg\/ml blood; Sigma-Aldrich) as anticoagulant and the antiprotease aprotinin (3000 121 \nKU\/ml blood; Sigma-Aldrich). Tissues (liver, skin, head kidney, brain, pituitary) were 122 \n 7\ndissected rapidly and transferred either to labelled cryotubes, or wrapped in foil, before 123 \nbeing snap frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -80oC. Blood samples were held on ice before 124 \nbeing centrifuged at 4oC. Plasma was aspirated and stored frozen (-20oC) in 100 \u00b5l 125 \naliquots for subsequent analysis. 126 \n 127 \n2.4 Hormone and metabolite analysis and statistical evaluation 128 \nAnalyses of conventional indicators of the neuroendocrine stress response were carried 129 \nout in order to support the interpretation of array data, and to confirm that the 130 \nphysiological status of the fish was as intended. Plasma corticotropin (ACTH) and 131 \ncortisol levels were determined by RIA (Balm and Pottinger, 1993; Pottinger and Carrick, 132 \n2001) and plasma glucose and lactate levels were determined spectrophotometrically 133 \n(Sigma Diagnostics procedures nos. 510 and 735). The hormone and metabolite data 134 \nwere subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA, GENSTAT) with time and treatment 135 \n(stressed, control) as factors and fish within tanks as blocking structure. Significant 136 \ndifferences were determined using the estimated SE of the differences between means 137 \nderived from the ANOVA. Where mean and variance were found to be interdependent, 138 \nthe data were log-transformed prior to analysis. 139 \n 140 \n2.5 RNA isolation 141 \nLiver samples for SSH library construction were selected from within the experimental 142 \ngroups on the basis of blood cortisol levels. Only unstressed fish with cortisol levels < 15 143 \nng\/ml were used for the control group, while fish with cortisol levels > 25 ng\/ml were 144 \n 8\nselected from among the stressed fish. Only female fish were selected for RNA isolation 145 \nto avoid expression anomalies that might be due to sex differences.  146 \n 147 \nTotal RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Maxi Kit (Qiagen). Routinely 0.3-0.5g liver 148 \ntissue yielded 1-2.5mg total RNA. An on-column DNase treatment step was incorporated 149 \nto yield samples predominantly free of contaminating DNA. The integrity of the RNA 150 \nwas checked by separating 5\u03bcg of RNA on formaldehyde denaturing gels. Only samples 151 \nthat showed no degradation after probing with an \u03b132P-labelled \u03b2-actin control cDNA, as 152 \nindicated by a sharp band with no \u2018tailing\u2019 were used for microarray analysis. 153 \nSubsequently all samples were re-analysed on the Agilent Bioanalyser: RNA Integrity 154 \nNumbers (RIN) averaged 9.72 \u00b1 0.38. RNA was quantified by UV spectrometry at 155 \n260nm (Shimadzu UV-1601). Following evaluation of blood cortisol levels it was 156 \ndecided to divide both stress and control samples into \u201cearly\u201d (2-48h) and \u201clate\u201d (96-157 \n504h) groups. Each group was represented by 9-13 fish. Poly A+ RNA was isolated from 158 \npooled RNA samples with affinity columns using the Oligotex mRNA Kit (Qiagen). The 159 \naverage yield of mRNA from 1mg of liver total RNA was 2%. Integrity and enrichment 160 \nof the poly A+ RNA was checked again using a \u03b2-actin probe. 161 \n 162 \nFor microarray screening, 5 samples of stressed and 5 samples of control fish were 163 \nobtained for each of the time points 0 h (control only), 2h, 6h, 24h, 168h and 504h. 164 \nAlthough only females were employed, there was no selection on the basis of cortisol 165 \nlevels. The quality of all these samples was verified by probing northern blots with \u03b2-166 \n 9\nactin. Because an insufficient number of high quality RNA preparations were available 167 \nthe 48h and 96h time points were excluded. 168 \n 169 \n2.6 SSH library construction 170 \nFour suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) libraries were constructed using the 171 \nPCR-Select cDNA Subtraction Kit (BD Biosciences). These corresponded to \u2018early\u2019 and 172 \n\u2018late\u2019 fish groupings (see previous section) and both the forward and reverse subtractions: 173 \neach subtraction was a stress group with its corresponding control group. SSH was 174 \nperformed following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol on 2 \u00b5g poly A+ RNA. An aliquot of 175 \nthe secondary PCR product (2 \u03bcl) was cloned into pCR2.1 vector using the TA Cloning 176 \nKit from Invitrogen, and transformed into chemically competent TOP10 E. coli 177 \n(Invitrogen). The efficiency observed was 1\u00b7105 colonies\/\u00b5g of DNA (5,000 colonies per 178 \ntransformation). Twenty-five white colonies were selected from each library and 179 \nsubjected to PCR. Insert sizes varied from 200 bp to 1,300 bp with 97% of clones having 180 \ninserts. In order to reduce redundancy within the four SSH libraries and yield a higher 181 \nnumber of unique clones an additional subtraction was carried out. The procedure was 182 \nbased on labelling the products of one library (or libraries) with biotin, hybridising these 183 \nwith a second library (or libraries), and cloning the unhybridised DNA after magnetic 184 \nseparation with streptavidin-tagged magnetic beads (Carninci et al., 2000). Three 185 \nsubtractions (libraries RTGL5-7) were carried out on the four liver SSH libraries 186 \n(RTGL1-4). 187 \n 188 \n2.7 Sequence analysis 189 \n 10\nAt the same time that samples were being prepared for PCR, duplicate plates of glycerol 190 \nstocks were sequenced (The Sanger Centre, Hinxton, Cambs.). Sequences were edited to 191 \nremove vector and adaptor sequences, and cleaned and filtered before clustering and 192 \nannotation by the SIGENAE information system (INRA Toulouse, France). Cleaning 193 \ninvolved masking of poor quality bases and low complexity sequences such as polyA 194 \nsequences. Filtering removed contaminating sequences (bacteria, yeast) and allowed only 195 \nsequences with more than 100 bases of high quality sequence to pass. Contigs were 196 \nannotated by comparison to the SwissProt database using the Blastx program 197 \n(http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/BLAST\/). In addition, because of the 3\u2019 bias to SSH 198 \nlibraries, sequences were also analysed and compared to a variety of nucleic acid 199 \ndatabases using the EST-Ferret program (Li, W., University of Liverpool; 200 \nhttp:\/\/legr.liv.ac.uk\/)  201 \n 202 \n2.8 Micoarray hybridisations 203 \nPCR (96-well) was carried out in detergent-less conditions in 30 mM Tricine, pH 8.0 204 \ncontaining 50 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTPs and 0.2\u03bcM of each nested primer 205 \n(same primers as used in the final stage of the SSH library construction). The reaction 206 \nvolume was 75 \u03bcl and 2.5 units of Biotaq (Bioline, UK) were used per reaction. 207 \nTemplates were the glycerol stocks of the SSH clones. Quality of PCR products was 208 \nassessed on ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels: single products of approximately 209 \nequal concentration were required. Printing of the arrays was carried out at the University 210 \nof Liverpool without further purification of PCR products..  211 \n 212 \n 11\nA reference design approach was taken for the microarray hybridisations: all 213 \nexperimental samples (10 \u03bcg) were labelled with one of the two dyes and compared to a 214 \nreference sample (10 \u03bcg) labelled with the second dye that consisted of a pool of all the 215 \nRNA samples used in the experiment. Denatured RNA (10 \u03bcg) was reversed transcribed 216 \nwith 75 units Stratascript reverse transcriptase (Stratagene, UK) in a total volume of 20 \u03bcl 217 \ncontaining RT buffer, 10 mM DTT and 1.25 mM amino-allyl dUTP\/dNTP (1:1) mix. The 218 \nreaction was primed with both an anchored oligo dT primer and a random primer (V9) at 219 \n0.25 \u03bcg\/\u03bcl and incubated at 42oC for 1 h before making a second addition of 50 units 220 \nStratascript reverse transcriptase. After a further 1 h at 42oC the reaction was stopped 221 \nwith 0.45M EDTA in 1M NaOH and neutralised with 0.75M HEPES, pH 7.4 containing 222 \n0.75M sodium acetate. The cDNA was purified on a Nucleospin column (Macherey-223 \nNagel), dried on a vacuum concentrator and resuspended with 5 \u03bcl 0.1M NaHCO3, pH 224 \n9.0. cDNAs (experimental and reference) were labelled with Cy5 and Cy3 dyes 225 \n(Amersham GE, UK) using the indirect labelling procedure as directed by the supplier. 226 \nAfter combining Cy5 and Cy3 labelled cDNAs and removal of unincorporated dyes on a 227 \nNucleospin column (Macherey-Nagel), samples were resuspended to 100\u03bcl with 228 \nArrayHyb Low Temp Hybridisation Buffer (Sigma, UK) at 65oC.  229 \n 230 \nSlides printed at the University of Liverpool were denatured by immersion in boiling 231 \n18M\u03a9 water for 1 min. Denatured, labelled target cDNA was applied to the microarray 232 \nslides, covered with a lifter slip (Erie Scientific) and the slides were incubated in a 233 \nhybridisation chamber (Genetix) at 50oC for 16 h. After hybridisation all slides were 234 \nwashed manually in 1x SSC, 0.1% SDS, 1mM DTT (2 x 5 min), 0.1xSSC, 0.1% SDS, 235 \n 12\n1mM DTT (2 x 5 min), rinsed briefly in 18M\u03a9 water (all solutions pre-warmed to 55oC) 236 \nand immersed briefly in room temperature isopropanol. Slides were centrifuged to 237 \ndryness and scanned immediately on a ScanArray Express HT scanner (Perkin Elmer). 238 \nGenepix software (GRI Ltd, UK) was employed to facilitate data acquisition from the 239 \nimages. Any spots in poor areas of the slides (smears, dust specks, poor spot morphology) 240 \nwere manually flagged as \u2018bad\u2019. 241 \n 242 \nA series of 55 hybridisations were planned to cover six time-points. At 2h, 6h, 24h, 168h 243 \nand 504h: five individual confined fish and five individual control fish (biological 244 \nreplicates) were used. Only control fish were required for the 0h time point. Although the 245 \nhybridisations utilised several batches of slides, these were distributed across conditions 246 \nand time points to minimise the possibility of bias arising. 247 \n 248 \n2.9 Microarray analysis 249 \nStage 1 of the analysis in GeneSpring involved an overview of all samples in order to 250 \nhighlight or remove spurious samples. Viewing of the Cy5\/Cy3 ratios in GeneSpring 251 \nallowed a subjective appreciation of poor slides that could be dismissed from the 252 \nanalysis. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was also used to examine variation across 253 \nthe samples with time and with animal: again this indicated slides to exclude from the 254 \nanalysis. Normalisation (after dye swapping) used the Lowess normalisation method even 255 \nthough this approach should not strictly be used on clones when the majority are expected 256 \nto be differentially regulated. Stage 2 of the analysis involved cleaning up the data by 257 \nfiltering out genes that showed large variability in their Cy5\/Cy3 ratios and\/or by filtering 258 \n 13\nout genes with near baseline raw signal intensities. Stage 3 involved the identification of 259 \npotential differentially regulated genes by use of one-way ANOVA.  260 \n 261 \n2.10  Quantitative RT-PCR analysis  262 \nTotal RNA samples with RNA Integrity Numbers (RIN) averaging 9.72 \u00b1 0.38 were used 263 \nfor qRT-PCR. cDNA was synthesized from 5 \u03bcg of total RNA and 500 ng of polydT 264 \nprimer in a reaction volume of 40 \u03bcl using SuperScriptTM III reverse transcriptase 265 \n(Invitrogen) following the supplier\u2019s protocol. Primers were designed for qRT-PCR for 266 \nall selected 12 candidate genes plus two housekeeping genes using Vector NTI 267 \nAdvance\u2122 software (Invitrogen). Size of the amplicons to be produced ranged between 268 \n100-150 base pairs. qPCR reactions were set up as follows: 10 \u03bcl of QuantiTect SYBR 269 \nGreen PCR Kit (Qiagen), 0.5 \u03bcM final concentration of primers, 5 \u03bcl of cDNA template 270 \nat dilution of 1:12.5 dilution and to a final volume of 20 \u03bcl with RNase-free water. The 271 \nMx3000P\u00ae QPCR system (Stratagene) was used for performing the qPCR reaction. The 272 \nprogram used for qPCR was 95\u00b0C for 15 min, 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15s, annealing at 51 273 \n\u2013 60 \u00b0C (depending on primers) for 30s and extension at 72\u00b0C for 30s. Dissociation 274 \ncurves were examined at the end of the PCR reaction to check for unspecific 275 \namplification and primer-dimers. 276 \n 277 \nRelative changes in the expression of candidate genes were calculated using the method 278 \ndescribed by Pfaffl (2001). To assess the PCR efficiency of each gene, standard curves 279 \nwere created by serial dilution of standard cDNA preparations.  280 \n 281 \n 14\n3. Results 282 \n 283 \n3.1 Hormone and metabolite levels during confinement 284 \nThe changes in plasma ACTH, cortisol, glucose and lactate levels in control and confined 285 \nfish over the duration of the study are shown in Fig. 1 (a \u2013 d). 286 \n[Insert Figure 1] 287 \n3.1.1 ACTH 288 \nOverall, ANOVA revealed plasma ACTH levels to be higher in confined than control fish 289 \n(P<0.001: Fig. 1a). This difference was most pronounced between 24 h and 96 h after the 290 \nonset of confinement. Plasma ACTH levels in confined fish increased significantly 291 \nbetween time 0 and 1 h (P<0.01) although a high level of variation among ACTH values 292 \nin control fish means that no significant difference between control and confined fish was 293 \ndetected at 1 h. There was no significant difference between control values at 0 h and 1 h. 294 \nThe peak in plasma ACTH that was observed at 48 h after the onset of confinement in 295 \nstressed fish coincides with disturbances in both glucose and lactate in the confined group 296 \nand suggests that these fish experienced a stressful event that was imposed upon the 297 \nongoing confinement. Inspection of the data reveals that the increase was accounted for 298 \nprimarily by the fish within one of the two confinement tanks sampled at this time. It may 299 \nbe the case that agonistic social interaction within this tank was particularly pronounced.   300 \n 301 \n3.1.2 Cortisol 302 \nANOVA revealed highly significant effects of both time (P<0.001) and treatment 303 \n(P<0.001) on plasma cortisol levels with confined fish displaying overall higher plasma 304 \n 15\ncortisol levels than unconfined individuals (Fig. 1b). Plasma cortisol levels rose rapidly 305 \nfollowing the onset of confinement to reach a level that was consistently sustained until 306 \ndeclining between 96 and 336h. Between 336h ad 648h plasma cortisol levels in control 307 \nand confined fish were statistically indistinguishable. It is noteworthy that little direct 308 \ncorrelation between plasma cortisol and plasma ACTH levels was evident, either for 309 \ntreatment groups or individual fish (data not shown). In addition, although not evident 310 \nfrom Fig. 1, there was a marked difference in plasma cortisol levels between fish from the 311 \ntwo confinement tanks sampled at 48 h, consistent with similar observations for the other 312 \ndeterminands. For most of the study period, mean plasma cortisol levels in the control 313 \ngroups remained below 10 ng\/ml. However, between 2h and 6h mean levels rose from 5.7 314 \nto 38.7 ng\/ml before declining again to 6.5 ng\/ml by 48h. This is coincident with some 315 \nminor disturbance of ACTH levels in the control fish and may reflect an unattributable 316 \ndisturbance to the fish in the tanks sampled on these occasions. These tanks had not been 317 \nsampled previously.  318 \n 319 \n3.1.3 Glucose 320 \nPlasma glucose levels changed significantly with both time and treatment (P<0.001: Fig. 321 \n1c). There was no evidence of an early elevation in plasma glucose levels following 322 \ntransfer to the confinement tanks but levels began to rise after 6 h to reach a peak at 48 h, 323 \nbefore declining to baseline levels between 168 and 336 h. An increase in plasma glucose 324 \nlevels at 48 h in the confined fish was coincident with peaks in plasma ACTH and lactate 325 \nlevels, probably for the reasons noted above. There was a steady and significant 326 \n 16\n(P<0.001) decline in plasma glucose levels in the control fish during the course of the 327 \nstudy, presumably related to the absence of food.   328 \n 329 \n3.1.4 Lactate 330 \nSignificant variation was evident in lactate levels in both control and confined groups 331 \n(Fig. 1d). The ANOVA reported significant treatment (P<0.001) and time (P<0.001) 332 \neffects which appeared to have two major components. A significant elevation in plasma 333 \nlactate levels was evident in confined fish within 1 h of the start of the study (P<0.001). 334 \nIn addition, there was a gradual but significant (P<0.01) increase in lactate levels in 335 \ncontrol fish between 4 h and 48 h such that lactate levels in confined fish were 336 \nsignificantly lower than those in controls for the latter phase of the confinement period. 337 \nFurthermore, there was a two-fold increase in lactate levels in confined fish at 48 h 338 \n(P<0.001), at the same time as increases in plasma ACTH and glucose were observed. 339 \n 340 \n3.2 Sequence analysis 341 \nThe array consisted of 21120 spots most of which were unknown sequences at the time of 342 \nmicroarray printing. Of these, 1011 were liver clones isolated from the four confinement 343 \nstress SSH libraries and 621 were liver clones isolated after the redundancy subtraction 344 \nfrom these same four libraries (section 2.6). The complete array will be described 345 \nelsewhere but an overview of its composition is presented in figure 2.  In addition to the 346 \n1632 liver clones from confinement stress there were also 1536 pituitary clones and 1152 347 \nbrain clones from fish exposed to a confinement stressor.  Liver clones from fish exposed 348 \nto a temperature stressor (3072), hypoxia stressor (1536) and pathogen exposure (960) 349 \n 17\nwere also represented. There were additional clones from the brain tissue of fish exposed 350 \nto temperature (3072) and hypoxia stressors (1536), muscle clones from temperature  351 \n(3072) and hypoxia stressor-exposed fish (1536), and gill (980), head kidney (960) and 352 \nmixed tissue (460) clones from pathogen exposed fish.  Only a subset of the liver clones 353 \n(769 clones of the 1632 clones relating to confinement stress) was sequenced generating 354 \n507 quality sequences made up of 247 different contigs, 49 of which were singletons. The 355 \nlevel of redundancy overall was ~51% for the liver confinement libraries. 356 \n[Insert Figure 2] 357 \n 358 \nA number of the liver clones had been generated by a redundancy subtraction procedure 359 \ndescribed in section 2.6. One of the redundancy-subtracted libraries (RTGL5) was a 360 \ndirect subtraction from the \u2018forward late\u2019 library (RTGL3) and there were approximately 361 \nequal numbers of clones with data from each. The redundancy-subtracted library 362 \nproduced 35% more unique clones than the source library. Furthermore, two highly 363 \nrepresented genes (apolipoprotein A-I-1 and EST16605) were reduced in representation 364 \nfrom 23% to 3% and from 16% to 8% respectively in the redundancy-subtracted library. 365 \n 366 \n3.3 Characterisation of expression profiles.  367 \nA list of  clones (964) considered to be differentially regulated over the complete time 368 \ncourse was generated by a combination of data analysis approaches. Instead of restricting 369 \nthe analysis to one very stringent statistical test, lists of genes whose expression was 370 \naltered by exposure to confinement were generated by a number of tests and how these 371 \nlists overlapped was taken into account before deciding on the most relevant genes. The 372 \n 18\ntwo main approaches were an ANOVA over time with multiple test correction 373 \n(Benjamini and Hochberg False Discovery Rate) and a t-test comparing stressed samples 374 \nwith their corresponding controls. Analysis of the confinement stressor by microarray 375 \nanalysis clearly demonstrated that the most significant gene expression changes occurred 376 \nover the 24 h to 168 h time period with a general return to control levels by 504 h. 377 \nChanges in expression levels over the first 6 h were evident for only a few genes.  378 \n 379 \nAs stated above most of the clones were unknown at the time the arrays were printed and 380 \nas a result many genes were represented multiple times on the array. This allowed 381 \nexamination of the reproducibility of the array. The genes most frequently represented 382 \nwere the haptoglobin precursor (101x), EST10729 (28x), CIRBP (21x) and complement 383 \nC3-1 (71x). There were however 110 instances of the haptoglobin precursor on the whole 384 \narray and 9 instances not showing significance. On inspection of the expression patterns 385 \nit was clear that all 110 instances showed the same clear expression profile. Similarly all 386 \ninstances of EST10729 show a common expression pattern. On the other hand, there were 387 \nover 1000 instances of complement component C3-1 on the whole array yet only 71 of 388 \nthese clones were identified as significantly differentially expressed. That is, the 389 \nexpression pattern for all instances of complement component C3-1 showed no common 390 \npattern suggesting the detection of changes in expression level of this gene is probably 391 \ndue only to its high representation on the array.  392 \n 393 \nA shorter list of 314 differentially expressed clones was generated using the more 394 \nstringent Bonferroni multiple test correction. Of these clones 138 (44%) provided quality 395 \n 19\nsequence information. Uninformative clones were the result of a combination of factors: 396 \nnot all clones were selected for sequencing, some selected clones gave no sequence 397 \ninformation, some gave poor quality sequence and some gave less than 100 bases of 398 \nquality sequence. The 138 clones were composed of 39 different contigs with 399 \nidentification of 28 genes, leaving unidentified a number of EST contigs and singletons. 400 \nThe list of significant genes comprised predominantly genes originally isolated from liver 401 \nand brain libraries. When compared to the whole array (953 annotated genes) using the 402 \nGOTree Machine (GOTM) program (Zhang et al., 2004), no biological process category 403 \nwas over-represented at levels 4 or 5. However, in a broader context (i.e. levels above 4 404 \nand 5) the \u201cResponse to stimulus\u201d category was over-represented (P<0.01). Also in the 405 \nbroader context, the cellular component category, \u201cExtracellular region\u201d was over-406 \nrepresented (P<0.01). Genes that fall into these categories include: (response to stimulus) 407 \nhaptoglobin, complement factor H-related protein 1, fibrinogen beta polypeptide, 408 \ncomplement component factor H, cold-inducible RNA binding protein and (extracellular 409 \nregion) haptoglobin, complement factor H-related protein 1, fibrinogen beta polypeptide, 410 \nprocollagen typeVIII  alpha 1, inter-alpha (globulin) inhibitor H2 and secreted 411 \nphosphoprotein 2. There are, however, too few annotated genes (24) in the list of 314 412 \ndifferentially expressed genes to carry out significant Gene Ontology analysis of 413 \nconfinement stress in the liver.  414 \n 415 \nA k-means clustering of the 964 clone list suggested six main expression patterns (Figure 416 \n3). The main group (Set 1 - 332 clones) showed up-regulation at 24 h and 168 h and a 417 \nreturn towards the control level by 504 h. The seminal gene in this list was the 418 \n 20\nhaptoglobin precursor but it also included fibrinogen (beta and gamma polypeptides). A 419 \nsecond group (Set 2 - 94 clones) also showed up-regulation at 24 h and 168 h and a return 420 \ntowards the control level by 504 h. Despite this similarity the component sequences of 421 \nSets 1 and 2 were clearly different \u2013 for example, Set 2 did not include any of the 110 422 \ninstances of haptoglobin on the array, instead, the seminal set member was complement 423 \nfactor H. Set 3 (131 clones) was maximally down-regulated at 168 h but showed some 424 \ndown regulation of several members as early as 2 h (RpL7, TC8053 and TC7970). The 425 \nseminal member of this group was CIRBP (cold-inducible RNA-binding protein) but it 426 \nalso included alpha-1-antitrypsin homolog, RpL35 and AMBP protein precursor. Set 4 427 \n(107 clones) was similar to Set 3 in being down regulated over 24 h and 168 h: in fact 428 \ndown regulation of these genes in the stressed group at 168 h and 504 h was more 429 \npronounced when compared to expression levels in the control samples which were 430 \nmarkedly up-regulated relative to the earlier time points. This is clearer in TC8200 than 431 \n14-3-3 (see Figure 4). There is no clear characteristic sequence in this group but the tissue 432 \norigins of the clones in this set were heavily biased towards brain rather than liver 433 \nlibraries. Set 5 (58 clones) showed immediate down regulation at 2 h, followed by up 434 \nregulation over 6-24 h, then a second down regulation at 168 h before returning to normal 435 \nat 504 h. The seminal member was alpha1-acid glycoprotein (orosomucoid) but the set 436 \nalso included serum albumin. The final set (Set 6 -103 clones) also showed early down-437 \nregulation over 2-6 h then a steady up-regulation from 24 h to 504 h. The seminal 438 \nmembers of Set 6 were EST10729 and ceruloplasmin. In this set control samples showed 439 \na similar expression pattern to that in stressed fish but generally of a lesser magnitude. 440 \n[Insert Figure 3] 441 \n 21\nOverall, the expression patterns that were seen in the stressed fish were also seen, though 442 \nto a more muted extent in the 6 h and 24 h control samples. This corresponds to the 443 \nunattributable elevation of plasma cortisol levels in the ostensibly undisturbed control 444 \nfish described above and evident in Fig 1b. 445 \n 446 \nTo determine whether the pattern of gene expression in response to confinement varied 447 \nbetween individual fish an ANOVA was carried out for specific time points. Analysis of 448 \nhaptoglobin (all instances on the array) at 168h showed that fish 191 was clearly very 449 \ndifferent from fish 190. Fish 191 was notable within this group of confined fish in that its 450 \nplasma cortisol levels were atypically low (16.5 ng\/ml) compared to those of the others in 451 \nthe group (295.4 ng\/ml, 179.9 ng\/ml and 44.7 ng\/ml for fish 190, 188 and 181 452 \nrespectively). At this time point the ranking of the individual haptoglobin responses 453 \nmatched that of the cortisol ranking. 454 \n 455 \n3.4 Quantitative PCR 456 \nTo validate the microarray results two genes were selected from each of the six k-means 457 \ncluster groups for real time RT-PCR (qPCR). Primer sequences were generally based on 458 \nactual clone sequences on the array (with reference to the contig) rather than homologous 459 \ndatabase sequences (but see Table 1). The 2 h time point was omitted from the qPCR 460 \nexperiment as the microarray suggested expression changes were small over the first 6 h. 461 \nGenerally the same five fish (both control and stress) were used in the qPCR experiment 462 \nas were used in the microarray experiment.  Two housekeeping genes (\u03b2-actin and 18S 463 \nRibosomal RNA gene) were shown to remain at a consistent level between the control 464 \n 22\nand stress groups, and over time. However, there was some inter-individual variability in 465 \nthe expression of these genes and therefore both genes were averaged for use in 466 \nnormalising expression levels. All expression levels were related to the 0 h control using 467 \na calculation method based on differences in Ct and amplification efficiency (Pfaffl, 468 \n2001). 469 \n 470 \nAll control samples gave a very similar expression pattern with a general rise after 24 h 471 \nthrough 168 h and 504 h.  Although changes in gene expression patterns detected over 472 \ntime in the stressed fish generally showed good correlation between qPCR and 473 \nmicroarray methods (see below) the magnitude of expression change was often reported 474 \nby qPCR as being greater than that detected on the microarray.  Sets 1 and 2 showed 475 \nquite similar expression patterns with maximum expression over 168 h and 504 h: this 476 \nmaximum appeared to be reached somewhat later in Set 2. Maximum relative changes in 477 \nexpression detected by qPCR were ~13-fold and ~3.5-fold compared to ~2.2-fold and 478 \n~1.8-fold by microarray for haptoglobin and \u03b2-fibrinogen respectively (both Set 1). Sets 479 \n3 and 4 also showed up-regulation with time, however expression appeared to increase in 480 \ntwo steps, from 0 h to 6 h then 24 h to 504 h with a plateau of expression between 6 h and 481 \n24 h.  The maximum expression levels in these two sets at 504 h were very similar 482 \nbetween the stress and control groups with at least CIRBP suggesting a late down-483 \nregulation in the stress group compared to the control group.  Set 5 showed maximum 484 \nexpression levels at 6 h but quite an irregular pattern over time in both control and stress 485 \ngroups. Set 6 genes were up-regulated over time with a slight tendency to dip between 6 h 486 \nand 24 h before increasing again through 504 h.  487 \n 23\n 488 \nAs mentioned above the magnitude of expression changes as measured by microarray 489 \nwere more muted than those detected by qPCR, however the patterns of expression 490 \ngenerally correlated well between both methodologies. Correlations were determined for 491 \neach fish individually and were found to be significant (P<0.05) for 8 of the 12 genes 492 \nexamined with correlation coefficients for haptoglobin and EST10729 of 0.67 and 0.90 493 \nrespectively. Neither of the two genes of Set 5 correlated significantly between 494 \nmethodologies but both genes of Sets 1, 2 and 6 did correlate significantly.  495 \n 496 \n4. Discussion 497 \nThe elevation of plasma ACTH and plasma cortisol in the confined fish clearly indicated 498 \nthat the stressor employed in these studies activated the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal 499 \naxis in a manner consistent with previous studies using this approach (Pottinger et al., 500 \n1994). Plasma cortisol levels in the confined fish displayed a profile typical of rainbow 501 \ntrout subjected to a chronic stressor with significantly elevated levels during the early 502 \nstages of confinement being followed by an acclimatory return to baseline levels within 503 \n336 h. Among the control fish the range of mean plasma cortisol values observed (0.8 \u2013 504 \n38.7 ng\/ml) was greater than is normally typical of unstressed trout due in large part to 505 \nelevated levels in several consecutive samples between 2 h and 48 h after the start of the 506 \nstudy. There is no clear explanation for this and we assume that some unaccounted for 507 \ndisturbance of these tanks took place during the sampling period. The six control tanks 508 \nthat were sampled at 4, 6 and 24 h when cortisol levels were most elevated were sampled 509 \nagain at 96 h, 336 h and 504 h respectively at which time levels were typical of 510 \n 24\nundisturbed fish.  To ensure a contrast between stressed and unstressed individuals 511 \ncontrol fish liver samples for the SSH exercise were selected from individuals whose 512 \nplasma cortisol levels at the time of sampling did not exceed 15 ng\/ml.  513 \n 514 \nExposure of trout to prolonged confinement is characteristically accompanied by 515 \ndisturbances in plasma glucose levels and plasma lactate levels (Trenzado et al., 2003) 516 \nand both responses were evident in the present study. Perhaps surprisingly, no short-term 517 \nelevation of plasma glucose was detected initially in the confined fish, although levels 518 \nwere elevated during the 24h \u2013 168h period. Short-term glucose elevation is a widely 519 \nobserved response of fish to acute stressors so the absence of this response is puzzling. It 520 \nis possible that the severity of the initial stressor was insufficient to cause a change in 521 \ncirculating catecholamine levels (Perry and Bernier, 1999), considered to be the mediator 522 \nof stress-induced hyperglycaemia in fish. The short period of hyperlactemia that occurred 523 \nin confined fish early in the time-course was presumably associated with the respiratory 524 \nconsequences of chasing, netting and transfer to the confinement tanks and was rapidly 525 \nameliorated within 2 \u2013 4 hours. The occurrence of slightly elevated plasma lactate levels 526 \nin the control fish between 4h and 168 h is not easily explained but does coincide with the 527 \nanomalous elevation of plasma cortisol in the control fish. Overall, the experimental data 528 \nindicate that the response of these fish to confinement was consistent with previous 529 \nfindings and provided a suitable vehicle for further investigation of gene expression in the 530 \nliver. 531 \n 532 \n 25\nThe analysis of gene expression in liver tissue from confined fish that is presented here is 533 \npart of a larger EU study \"STRESSGENES: A Functional Genomics Approach to 534 \nMeasuring Stress in Fish Aquaculture\" (Q5RS-2001-002211) that includes analysis of 535 \ngene expression during exposure to a confinement stressor in other tissues (head kidney, 536 \nbrain, pituitary and gill) and additional stressors (temperature shift, hypoxia, salinity 537 \nstress and pathogen exposure) in a range of relevant tissues. For each tissue SSH libraries 538 \nwere constructed and 'pre-arrays' were hybridised to eliminate unchanging genes. Initially 539 \narrays comprising unselected clones (Phase 1 arrays) were constructed followed by one 540 \narray using a selected clone set (Phase 2 array). For the experiment reported here a Phase 541 \n1 array was used: a consequence of this is that there was not full sequence analysis of the 542 \nclones. 543 \n 544 \nAs noted above, the list of genes whose expression was significantly altered comprised 545 \npredominantly genes originally isolated from liver and brain libraries and these fell 546 \nlargely into one biological process category (response to stimulus) and one cellular 547 \ncomponent category  (extracellular region). Analysis of the gene expression profile in 548 \nliver tissue during confinement revealed a number of significant clusters. The major 549 \npatterns comprised genes that were up-regulated at 24 h and beyond, the primary 550 \nexamples being haptoglobin, fibrinogen, TC8442, ceruloplasmin and EST10729. 551 \nHaptoglobin expression was up-regulated at 24 h and transcripts maintained this high 552 \nlevel through to the 168 h sample. After 504 h (21 days) continuous confinement 553 \nexpression levels approached but had not yet reached control levels. Quantification of 554 \ngene expression levels by qPCR confirmed the microarray expression pattern and showed 555 \n 26\nan up-regulation of approximately 13-fold over the zero time point control and 556 \napproximately 8-fold over the paired control. Of all the genes validated by qPCR this was 557 \nthe greatest change in the magnitude of expression observed but this does not rule out the 558 \npossibility of greater changes in other genes that were not scrutinized with qPCR \u2013 for 559 \nexample, TC17071 appeared more differentially regulated on the microarray than many 560 \nof the haptoglobin clones. Although not evident from the microarray, haptoglobin was 561 \nup-regulated 4-5-fold by 6 h. In functional terms, haptoglobin is a prominent acute phase 562 \nprotein in man and in most mammalian species studied. Circulating levels of this protein  563 \ncan change by between 2-fold to over 10-fold depending on the species (Petersen et al., 564 \n2004). In fish (O.mykiss) elevated plasma levels of haptoglobin have been identified after 565 \na variety of bacterial and viral challenges, but changes in haptoglobin levels have not 566 \npreviously been linked to a non-immunological stressor (Bayne et al., 2001). In rainbow 567 \ntrout, 24 h after receiving a bacterin injection, up-regulation of haptoglobin at the 568 \ntranscript level on an oligo-microarray was limited (2-fold) but qPCR showed large 569 \nvariation in individual fish response (Gerwick et al., 2006). In other studies on rainbow 570 \ntrout,  there was no significant change in brain haptoglobin expression following a 571 \nhandling stress (Krasnov et al., 2005a) in liver haptoglobin expression after toxicant 572 \nexposure (Krasnov et al., 2005b) or in aflatoxin-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (Tilton 573 \net al., 2005). In pigs haptoglobin levels are not elevated in response to cold, heat or 574 \ntransport stressors (Hicks et al., 1998). It is however elevated in disease and subclinical 575 \nstates suggesting that in pigs at least it is a good indicator of the health status of the 576 \nanimal (Petersen et al., 2004). In calves stress related to housing on a slippery floor raised 577 \n 27\nlevels of the acute phase protein serum amyloid A but not that of haptoglobin 578 \n(Alsemgeest et al., 1995). 579 \n 580 \nThe main role of haptoglobin appears to be in conserving haemoglobin, haem and iron 581 \nafter their release from damaged red blood cells and the prevention of oxidative stress. 582 \nScavenging iron is also believed to be important in preventing the growth of iron-583 \nrequiring bacteria (Bullen, 1981). Genes coding for proteins such as albumin, 584 \nceruloplasmin, hepicidin, lactoferrin, transferrin, ferritin and hemopexin might be 585 \nexpected to play a similar role. Differential regulation of both ceruloplasmin and albumin 586 \nwas identified in this study (though controls and stress were very similar) but neither 587 \nhepcidin nor lactoferrin were selected for the array (suggesting no treatment-related  588 \nchange in their expression levels) and neither ferritin nor transferrin showed any clear 589 \nchange on the microarray. Transferrin has been described as both a positive and negative 590 \nacute phase protein in different species and there is a suggestion that it is a positive acute 591 \nphase protein under an inflammatory stimulus in trout (Bayne and Gerwick, 2001). Apart 592 \nfrom alterations in haptoglobin itself there was minimal evidence in the present study that 593 \nexposure to a prolonged stressor produced alterations in other factors responsible for iron 594 \nmetabolism\/storage. 595 \n 596 \nSerum albumin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (orosomucoid) fall within the same 597 \nexpression cluster (Set 5 in Figure 3) and are again considered to be acute phase proteins 598 \nin several mammalian species (Gabay and Kushner, 1999). On the microarray both 599 \ntranscripts demonstrate a very early (2 h) down-regulation, followed by rapid up-600 \n 28\nregulation by 6 h and then a second more prolonged down-regulation over 168 h.  601 \nHowever, neither of these gene expression patterns detected on the microarray correlated 602 \nclosely with the pattern determined by qPCR. Both genes were up-regulated at 6 h and 603 \nalthough orosomucoid expression in stressed fish showed a downward trend from 6 h to 604 \n504 h, serum albumin showed no tendency for reduced expression over the later time 605 \npoints. (Relative to the paired control samples, whch exhibited some variation with time,  606 \nserum albumin does show a downward trend). The absence of the 2 h time point from the 607 \nqPCR does not preclude the possibility of an early 2 h down-regulation. Orosomucoid 608 \n(ORM1), like many acute phase proteins, does not have a well-defined role although it is 609 \nconsidered both anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory. It is reported to interact with 610 \nserum albumin (Krauss et al., 1986), which possibly explains the broadly similar gene 611 \nexpression patterns observed for the two transcripts, and with plasminogen activator 612 \ninhibitor type 1 (PAI-1). When orosomucoid is upregulated (6 h), PAI-1 (a serpin) is 613 \nmaintained in a highly active form: proteinase inhibitor activity is therefore maximal over 614 \nthis period before it falls quite dramatically over the 24 h to 168 h period.  High levels of 615 \nproteinase inhibitory activity may allow the build up of the acute phase proteins and 616 \nsubsequent reduction of this activity may facilitate the removal of the acute phase 617 \nproteins and return to a pre-challenge steady-state. The very early down regulation (at 2 618 \nh, seen on the microarray) may be the consequence of some immediate need for protease 619 \nactivity \u2013 possibly to do with activation of complement or blood clotting cascades. The 620 \nabsence of correlation in Set 5 may suggest that this cluster is weakly assigned. 621 \n 622 \n 29\nConsistent with this speculation is the fact that another group of functionally related 623 \nproteins that appear from the microarray to be down-regulated late in the stress process 624 \nare the protease inhibitors alpha-1-antitrypsin homolog and alpha-2-HS glycoprotein 625 \nprecursor (a cysteine protease inhibitor). Both  are both down-regulated through 24 h and 626 \n168 h. Although qPCR shows up-regulation of alpha-1-antitrypsin homolog over 6 h and 627 \nagain at 504 h, the net effect is one of down-regulation compared to the paired controls. 628 \nAlpha2-macroglobulin (A2M) is a major acute phase protein in many species but has not 629 \nbeen identified as such in trout (Bayne and Gerwick, 2001). Like serum amyloid A (see 630 \nbelow) it does not appear in an identifiable form on the array. Alpha2-macroglobulin is 631 \nalso an antiproteinase inhibitor acting on enzymes such as trypsin, thrombin and 632 \ncollagenase. It is believed to interact with alpha1-microglobulin\/bikumin precursor 633 \n(AMBP). Interestingly AMBP was identified as a significantly differentially regulated 634 \ngene and was found in the same cluster (Set 3) as alpha-1-antitrypsin homolog. 635 \n 636 \nSerum albumin is normally considered a negative acute phase protein as it decreases 637 \nunder an acute phase stress. Here, however, as discussed above, the expression pattern as 638 \nit relates to the abundance of RNA transcript seems much more complex. Whether this is 639 \na consequence of message levels not necessarily reflecting protein levels, or that 640 \nconfinement stress is not a severe enough stressor, or that stress responses as 641 \ncharacterised in mammals are not wholly applicable to non-mammalian vertebrates, is 642 \nunclear from the present study. It should be noted that to treat the full period of 643 \nconfinement as the imposition of a homogeneous stressor upon the fish is probably a 644 \ngross simplification. The nature of the stressor as perceived by the fish is likely to alter 645 \n 30\nover time, from being primarily a disturbance\/novelty\/unfamiliar environment combined 646 \nwith spatial restriction in the first few hours after transfer to the confinement tank, to a 647 \nprimarily social stressor after more time has elapsed. Acclimation to the confinement 648 \nenvironment is quite rapid when fish are held in isolation, but requires increasingly 649 \nlonger as the size of the interacting group increases (Pottinger and Pickering, 1992). 650 \n 651 \nDifferences in immune system function between mammals and fish are very significant. 652 \nFish are dependent on innate, non-lymphoid mechanisms to defend themselves against 653 \ninfection and trauma, whereas mammals exploit  an adaptive immune system based upon 654 \nT- and B-cells. Fish are therefore much more dependent than mammals on a non-specific 655 \nresponse focusing on defensive proteins dissolved in body fluids and possibly have 656 \nadapted their functions accordingly. There are some immune-related genes that are, 657 \nperhaps surprisingly, missing from the list of differentially expressed genes obtained 658 \nduring the present study. Serum amyloid A does not appear in an identifiable form on the 659 \narray: its absence from the liver confinement SSH libraries suggests it is not a significant 660 \npart of the non-specific stress response in trout.  The pentraxins, although represented on 661 \nthe array, show no significant change in expression. Two clearly different pentraxins are 662 \non the array: one is the published SAP-like pentraxin (Jensen et al., 1997) but the second 663 \nhas almost equal homology to human serum amyloid P and human C-reactive protein (see 664 \naccession nos. CR944257 and CR944502). Although not significant, the SAP-like 665 \npentraxin appears to be down-regulated from 6 h and maximally at 168 h whereas the 666 \nother pentraxin appears to be up-regulated at 168 h. If there is an acute phase response to 667 \n 31\na prolonged non-invasive stressor in trout it does not follow the pattern found following a 668 \npathogenic challenge. 669 \n 670 \nAlso of interest is the relative absence of differentially regulated genes associated with 671 \ngluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis in the liver confinement study. Intuitively, an early 672 \nup-regulation and a later reversal of this process might be anticipated, in order to support 673 \nthe hyperglycaemic response normally seen in stressed fish. It is of course possible that 674 \nthe severity of the confinement stressor is not substantial enough to require changes in the 675 \nexpression levels of key genes involved in gluconeogenesis and instead post-translational 676 \nmodifications (phosphorylation, etc) are sufficient to regulate the process. Indeed the 677 \nabsence of an immediate rise in blood glucose levels in this confinement experiment 678 \nmight explain why gluconeogenesis- and glycogenolysis- related genes were not to the 679 \nfore in the microarray analysis. A gene identified as a glycogen synthase kinase binding 680 \nprotein (zebra fish; Danio rerio) is clearly upregulated at 24 h and 168 h though the 681 \nrelevance of this event is presently unclear. It is known that mammals mount qualitatively 682 \ndifferent acute phase responses to different stimuli and indications from the literature are 683 \nthat fish do likewise. 684 \n 685 \nKrasnov et al (2005a) used similar methods to those employed in the present study to 686 \ninvestigate the effects of handling stress on gene expression in both brain and head 687 \nkidney of rainbow trout. Although this earlier study found changes in some genes in 688 \ncommon with the present study (troponin C, immunoglobulin epsilon receptor, 14-3-3) 689 \nand these expression patterns over time appear similar, the majority of the genes for 690 \n 32\nwhich significant alterations in expression were reported are quite different. This is 691 \nprobably in part due to the different tissues studied and in part due to the choice of clones 692 \nin the microarray design, but it may also indicate that the response to a short handling 693 \nstress (Krasnov et al., 2005a) is quite different to that arising from a continuous 694 \nconfinement stressor (this study). Previous studies to have examined gene expression in 695 \ntrout liver tend to relate to toxicological challenge (Krasnov et al. 2005b; Hook et al., 696 \n2006; Tilton et al., 2007). What most of these studies have in common with each other 697 \nand with the current study is that the effects on gene expression are small, generally 698 \napproximating to 2-3 fold although changes quantified by qPCR are often larger than 699 \nthose detected by microarray. A bacterin challenge shows very large changes in liver 700 \nexpression of hepcidin and diacylglycerol O-acyl-transferase neither of which are seen to 701 \nrespond to confinement stress yet haptoglobin and DRTP1 are up-regulated in response to 702 \nboth stressors (Gerwick et al., 2007). There appear to be clear distinctions in gene 703 \nexpression patterns between different stressors: a gene that may be strongly up- or down-704 \nregulated in response to one stressor may not be responsive to a different type of stressor.   705 \nThis is exemplified by the diverse nature of the response to a group of model toxicants 706 \n(Hook et al., 2006). 707 \n 708 \nIn general the qPCR results confirmed the microarray results which therefore suggests the 709 \nlatter analysis can be used confidently to provide a \u201cglobal\u201d picture of the gene 710 \nexpression response to prolonged confinement stress in fish. Some patterns did conflict 711 \nbut this was probably a result of the weaker clusters where expression changes were quite 712 \nsmall on the array. It has been reported previously that correlations between microarray 713 \n 33\nand qPCR are best when expression changes are 2-fold or more (Morey et al., 2006). It 714 \nshould also be noted that only two genes were checked by qPCR from each cluster and 715 \nthat better correlations would have been achieved if only the most differentially 716 \nexpressed genes were validated. Ultimately,, protein levels (both in each relevant tissue 717 \nand in plasma) will have to be measured to get a clear indication of what is the full 718 \nphysiological response of the fish to confinement stress. In many cases though this will 719 \nawait the production of antibodies with specificity to fish proteins.  720 \n 721 \nOverall, the present study indicates that while the primary role of the liver during acute 722 \nand chronic stress may be linked with the provision of energy, this role is not reflected in 723 \nthe patterns of gene expression. Instead, the up-regulation of genes in trout during 724 \nexposure to a non-invasive stressor seems primarily to be associated with the non-specific 725 \ndefence. The results perhaps highlight the need for a multifaceted approach to the 726 \nanalysis of complex physiological processes such as the stress response where 727 \nexamination of neither expression profiles or key indicator endpoints alone provides a 728 \nfull picture of the events taking place. 729 \n 730 \n 731 \nAcknowledgements 732 \nThe authors thank T.

Each point 873 \nis the mean \u00b1 SEM of 12 fish. Significant differences between control and confined fish 874 \n 40\nare denoted by: * : P<0.05; **: P<0.01; ***: P<0.001. The shaded areas represent the 875 \ntwo time periods from which  samples were used to construct the SSH libraries. 876 \n 877 \nFigure 2. Organisation of the Phase 1 microarray. 878 \nThe Phase 1 array consisted of 21120 spotted cDNAs contributed to by three partners of 879 \nthe \u201cStressgenes\u201d project. Four stresses were represented and most of the clones were 880 \nderived from liver, brain and muscle SSH libraries. Numbers provide detail on the 881 \nnumber of clones spotted from each tissue\/stress. The liver confinement libraries went 882 \nthrough a second step of redundancy subtraction.  883 \n 884 \nFigure 3. Common expression patterns in response to a confinement stressor. RNA from 885 \nindividual fish exposed to a confinement stressor (and unstressed controls) was 886 \nhybridised in dye-swap experiments to a multi-tissue cDNA microarray. Normalised 887 \nexpression ratios (log2 transformed) were analysed by ANOVA by time (P<0.05 with 888 \nBenjamini and Hochberg False Discovery Rate multiple test correction) and clustered 889 \ninto six k-means groups. The scale ranges from 4-fold up-regulated (red) to 4-fold down-890 \nregulated i.e.0.25 (green). 891 \n 892 \nFigure 4. Individual expression patterns for some of the key members of the confinement 893 \nstressor k-means cluster groups. qPCR was carried out on 5 individuals (control and 894 \nstressed) for two gene members of each of Sets 1-6 (see Figure 3). All qPCR was carried 895 \nout in triplicate and fold change determined after normalisation to housekeeping genes \u03b2-896 \nactin and 18S. Microarray data is averaged data for every instance of that gene on the 897 \n 41\narray and is displayed as fold change relative to t = 0. qPCR data (squares and solid line) 898 \nis compared directly to microarray data (circles and dashed line). Stress data is in filled 899 \nsymbols and control data in empty symbols. Vertical axes are varied to best display the 900 \ncorrelation between the qPCR and microarray data.
