We lack however the tools for \nunderstanding the details and the structural forces at work within that landscape, a gap which this \npaper aims to fill by developing a concept of media and the boundaries and hierarchies that help \nproduce the media\u2019s legitimacy. \u2018Media power\u2019 means here the concentration of symbolic power \nin media institutions, particularly those of television, radio and the press (the common sense \ndefinition of \u2018the media\u2019), although the long-term impact of new media on media power is \nconsidered in the paper\u2019s conclusion. The central parts of the article discuss, first, the theoretical \nframework that underlies this approach, which draws by analogy on Durkheim\u2019s account of the \nsocial generation of the sacred\/profane distinction, but also on the work of Bourdieu and others; \nand, second, presents material from the author\u2019s empirical research on situations where non-\nmedia people come into close contact with the media process (both at leisure sites, such as \nGranada Studios Tour, the home of the set of the UK\u2019s longest running primetime soap, \nCoronation Street, and at protest sites featured in the media). The conclusion looks more broadly \nat the implications of this approach for grasping the tensions and conflicts inherent in today\u2019s \nmediated landscape of consumption. \n \nKeywords \nMEDIA POWER, SYMBOLIC POWER, SYMBOLIC VIOLENCE, HIDDEN INJURIES, \nBOUNDARY, RITUAL, CELEBRITY. \n \n3Introduction \n \nThere are many large-scale theories about the consumption landscape and its saturation with \nmedia messages and values, from Jean Baudrillard\u2019s vision of America as merely \u2018publicity \nspace\u2019, \u2018space for the image\u2019 (1993: 244), to Richard Stivers\u2019 (1994) diagnosis of America\u2019s \n\u2018culture of cynicism\u2019 in which all distinctions between reality and truth have disappeared in a \nplay of spectacle and performance. But these claims are so general (in spite of being directed at a \nsingle object, America) that they give us no insights into what particular consumers do. Surely \npeople make particular directed and self-reflexive journeys across the consumption landscape, \nand as theorists we too need concepts that will cut into that landscape, so that we can grasp its \ndetailed formations. This is the justification for this article\u2019s insistence upon structural categories \nthat on the face of it lie some way from the patterns of consumption, since I will suggest it is \nprecisely such categories that are at work in our everyday experience of a media-saturated \nconsumer culture.   \n \nThe question of the media\u2019s impacts on the wider landscape of consumption has been gaining \nmomentum for some time, and geography, as a discipline, has been central here. If an earlier \ngeneration of geographers (Meinig, 1979: 183; Jackson, 1994: viii) lamented the loss of a \nsymbolic landscape based in architecture and place, recent work has explored how media \nreferences have created a new symbolic landscape. The \u2018magic\u2019 of mediated place encompasses \nshopping malls (Kowinski, 1985; Hopkins, 1990; Langman, 1992) and theme parks, particularly \nthose which are sites of current or historical media production (Davis, 1996; Gottdiener, 1997; \nCouldry, 2000: Part Two), hence Sharon Zukin\u2019s claim that DisneyWorld\u2019s architecture matters \n\u2018not because it is a symbol of capitalism, but because it is the capital of symbolism\u2019 (Zukin, \n41991: 232). Rather than reduce this new landscape to an extension of the audience\u2019s supposed \npassivity before television (Sack, 1992, chapter 5), it is more useful to attend to its details, and \nthe divisions and hierarchies that structure them; in short, to take seriously the idea that it is a \n\u2018landscape of power\u2019 (Zukin, 1991), with all the complexity that implies.  \n \nI want to examine some key concepts for grasping the mediated consumer landscape, and its \nfault-lines: in particular, \u2018media power\u2019, and the categorical distinction between \u2018media\u2019 and \n\u2018ordinary\u2019 (things, people, events) that underlies it. There is indeed a symbolic dimension to the \npower relation between media consumers and producers; and, like the fault-line of class which \nSennett and Cobb (1972) eloquently analysed three decades ago, it brings its own hidden injuries. \nThe term \u2018hidden injuries\u2019 may seem surprising in relation to media power, in particular the \npower of popular media, and I  will explain this point further below. For now, let me explain that \nthe hidden injuries I discuss (like those of class) concern personal value, but they are linked to \nthe media-related frameworks through which we perceive the social world as a whole. Those \nframeworks span the media\u2019s factual\/fictional dimensions, and implicitly connect the consumer\u2019s \nspace which is paradigmatically private and political space which is paradigmatically public. This \nhas wider implications, to which I return in the conclusion.  \n \nTo study media at this general, almost ecological, level is to rework a question Lazarsfeld and \nMerton (1969) [1948] raised about \u2018media effects\u2019. Although many of their original questions \nabout media effects have been superseded, at least in the form in which they posed them, their \nfirst question remains important, and surprisingly neglected: what are \u2018the effects of the existence \nof . . . media in our society\u2019 (1969: 495)? But in spite of some suggestive comments, they \nconcluded that, given the impossibility of comparative \u2018control\u2019 studies of societies without mass \n5media, this question could not be researched empirically. Now, with the benefit of a less narrow \nparadigm of empirical research, I want to suggest otherwise. There are (contra Baudrillard) \nalways, potentially, \u2018cracks\u2019 in the mediated world we inhabit, moments when underlying \nassumptions and beliefs come into view, and those \u2018cracks\u2019 offer a way into researching media \npower, as it is reflected within and beyond consumer practice.   \n \nBy \u2018media\u2019, I will generally mean the common sense definition of \u2018the media\u2019 (television, radio \nand the press), quite large enough a topic to deal with for now; I will not be concerned so much, \nfor reasons I explain, with the differences between media, but rather with our broader sense of \n\u2018the media\u2019 as a site of value and truth within the social landscape. However, I return, in my \nconclusion, to the changes new media and media digitalization may bring to that landscape. By \n\u2018media power\u2019, I do not mean the power (ideological or otherwise) exercised upon us by specific \nmedia texts; I mean more generally media institutions\u2019 differential symbolic power, the \nconcentration of symbolic power in media institutions: that is, the fact that we take it for granted \nthat the media have the power to speak \u2018for us all\u2019  - indeed to define the social \u2018reality\u2019 that we \nshare1 - a power which individuals, corporations, pressure groups, professional bodies and even \nperhaps the state do not have.  \n \nResearching media power leads to a number of further questions, which I can only begin to \nanswer here. How \u2013 through what practices and beliefs - is this differential symbolic power of the \nmedia legitimated? How do those practices and beliefs (what we might call \u2018cultures of media \nbelief\u2019) vary from one territory to another? And how can understanding the cultures of media \nbelief help us better understand consumer culture in the broadest sense?  \n \n6Theoretical framework \n \nThe television theorist John Corner has written that \u2018the conception of \u201cpower\u201d within a notion \nof televisual process has now become a matter of the utmost importance and difficulty\u2019 (1997: \n258). The same might be said of \u2018power\u2019 within the media process more generally. There is a \ntension between appreciating the variable contents and contexts of daily media consumption and \nyet maintaining our grip on the society-wide issue of media power. I am interested less in how \nmedia contents reflect external pressures (ideological, economic, statist, and so on) than in how \nmedia affect social ontology: what kinds of things become \u2018social facts\u2019 and \u2018social realities\u2019? \nHow do media affect the categorisations which enable us to order the social world as a structured \nspace, or landscape, at all?  \n  \nAn Analogy from Durkheim  \n \nAny theorisation of the media\u2019s social impacts must start from their privileged role in framing \nour experiences of the social, and thereby defining what the \u2018reality\u2019 of our society is. Roger \nSilverstone (1988; cf Couldry, 2000: 42-44) has analysed how television is a ritual \u2018frame\u2019: a \ncognitive, imaginative, and practical space through which everyone can access simultaneously \nthe things that mark off the \u2018social\u2019 - what is shared by everyone - from the private and particular. \nThis analysis, which I would argue captures something fundamental about not just television but \nalso radio and to some extent the press, derives in part from an analogy with Durkheim\u2019s theory \n(1995) [1912] of how religion\u2019s pervasive distinction between \u2018sacred\u2019 and \u2018profane\u2019 is socially \ngenerated. Crucial here is Durkheim\u2019s underlying distinction between social experience and \nordinary experience, the force of which, he argues, grounds the sacred\/profane distinction itself. \n7This force derives from the individual\u2019s awe in the presence of the \u2018social\u2019 (1995: 208-25). \nDurkheim\u2019s account relates specifically to the sense of the sacred in a particular nomadic \nAboriginal society which he describes as coming together only occasionally for ritual occasions \nfocussed around totemic objects, but his description of the totemic object\u2019s power is still highly \nsuggestive for an analysis of television: \n \nImputing the emotions [of the social] to the image is all the more natural because being \ncommon to the group, they can only be related to a thing that is equally common to all. \nOnly the totemic emblem meets this condition. By definition, it is common to all. During \nthe ceremony, all eyes are upon it. Although the generations change, the image remains \nthe same. It is the abiding element of social life.  \n      (1995: 222, emphasis added) \n \nAnalogously \u2013 and this is only an analogy, as I explain later -  in a society of almost universal \ntelevision consumption, and largely shared patterns of programme availability,2  the simple fact \nthat television is \u2018by definition common to all\u2019 itself grounds its function as a frame for the \nsocial. Television\u2019s \u2018authority depends on its continual presence\u2019 (Silverstone 1983: 150). This \nfunction has over time been reinforced by many \u2018media events\u2019 (Dayan and Katz, 1992) when \ntelevision has performed that framing role quite explicitly (major sports events, royal ceremonial, \npolitical crises), but it is not only a dimension of exceptional media events; it is inherent to the \nmedia\u2019s permanent position as the frame through which private worlds face the social.  \n \nIt is artificial here to separate television from other mass media: radio and the press (compare my \nbroad \u2018common sense\u2019 definition of \u2018the media\u2019 above). First of all, while these media vary in the \n8degree to which they have \u2018mass\u2019 audiences (and if the press has always had a segmented \nreadership (Abercrombie, 1996: 153) the same is increasingly true of television and radio), all \nthese media, in any case, interpenetrate in consumption, referring to each other in a web of \nsignificance. Second, I am arguing that, over and above the detailed differences between these \nmedia, we have a sense of \u2018the media\u2019 which relates to the underlying functional position of \nmedia in society as the \u2018frame\u2019 through which we (as private citizens) access the social. The \nphrase \u2018the media\u2019, in this sense, while it maps onto the broad institutional sphere that links \ntelevision, radio and the press, is a constructed term, that operates by contrast to another \nconstructed term, \u2018the ordinary\u2019 (that is, the part of the social world that is not \u2018in\u2019 the media). It \nis this categorical distinction between \u2018media\u2019 (person, thing, world) and \u2018ordinary\u2019 (person, \nthing, world) that is at the root of media institutions\u2019 power, and the hidden injuries to which I \nsuggest that power gives rise.  \n \nAt this level also it is misleading to separate the media\u2019s fictional and news contents (whatever \nthe importance of doing so in other contexts, for example in genre analysis), because both derive \ntheir status from the media\u2019s special symbolic authority (Couldry, 2000: 51-52). Joshua \nMeyrowitz has put this point well: \n \n[Fictional] programmes are massive, shared experiences that everyone perceives as \nmassive shared experiences. Through such conscious sharing, they come to seem as real \nas - sometimes more real than - the varied and less shared experiences of our individual \nlives. (1992: 466)  \n \nThe significance of this apparently merely definitional point is clear, if \u2018most people watch \n9fiction [rather than news] on television most of the time\u2019 (Morley, 1999: 139). The implication is \nnot that we should downplay questions about the factual accuracy of television, but that we \nshould investigate how television\u2019s authority is reproduced across both news and fiction, and in \nthe blurring of the two. \n \nThe media\u2019s \u2018framing\u2019 function connects with another argument, about the categorisation, or the \n\u2018ordering\u2019, of the social world (Couldry, 2000: 44-50), which I have already touched upon in \nexplaining the particular way in which I am using the term \u2018the media\u2019.  Important here, once \nagain, is Durkheim\u2019s theory of the social origins of religion: particularly his account of the \n\u2018sacred\u2019\/\u2018profane\u2019 distinction (1995: 33-9). It is not that the media are literally \u2018sacred\u2019. Rather, \nthe sacred\/profane distinction is a useful structural analogue for a different distinction:  between \n\u2018media world\u2019 and \u2018ordinary world\u2019.  This latter distinction is particularly important in \nnaturalising the media\u2019s concentration of symbolic power.              \n  \nWhat distinguishes the division between \u2018sacred\u2019 and \u2018profane\u2019 according to Durkheim is not \ncontent (\u2018anything . . . can be sacred\u2019, 1995: 35) nor its use to rank objects and people (there are \nmany rankings whose significance is less profound), but simply the fact that the division is \n\u2018absolute\u2019: \u2018the sacred and the profane are always and everywhere conceived by the human \nintellect as separate genera, as two worlds with nothing in common\u2019. The division divides \u2018the \nworld into two domains, one containing all that is sacred and the other all that is profane\u2019; hence \nmaintaining this division requires in practice a general separation of sacred and profane things \n(1995: 36, 34, 38).  As we will see, there is a structural parallel between these points and the \nmedia case. \n \n10\nI want to be quite explicit about what I intend by adapting Durkheim here, and what I do not \nintend. I do not intend to claim that media contents are like religious contents (although many \nhave suggested that media are a sort of religion!); at most I am claiming a structural analogy \nbetween Durkheim\u2019s argument about how social categories such as sacred\/profane are generated \nand how (in different circumstances) another categorical distinction (media\/ordinary) is \ngenerated. (Still less am I taking a position on whether Durkheim\u2019s analysis of the sacred\/profane \ndistinction is a satisfactory account of contemporary religion\u2019s central features, nor do I need to \ndo so.) Like Bourdieu in his work (1991)on symbolic power, I am interested in Durkheim\u2019s \ngeneral notion of categorical distinctions, but with the added twist of arguing that  Durkheim\u2019s \naccount of sacred and profane helps explain some particular features of the media\/ordinary \ndistinction, since both distinctions have their origins in a regular experience of sociality, the \nexperience of \u2018togetherness\u2019 before shared reference-points, or what pass for shared reference-\npoints. Just as the hierarchical distinction between sacred and profane is (according to Durkheim) \ngrounded in the way the social is framed in a sacred context, so too the framing of the social \nthrough a media context is what grounds a pervasive, and I suggest hierarchical distinction \nbetween \u2018media world\u2019 (everything associated with the media process) and \u2018ordinary world\u2019 \n(everything outside it). It is this categorical distinction that underlies, I suggest, our sense of \nmedia power as both \u2018natural\u2019 and legitimate.  \n \nI will come back to the question of hierarchy in a moment and seek to justify it further through \nmy empirical examples. First, however, let me emphasise that, while we can develop an analogy \nfrom Durkheim that helps us capture the depth of the media\u2019s power, and its roots in the \norganisation of social experience itself, it is equally important to see the limits of any \nDurkheimian model of media power. The media\/ordinary distinction is not a \u2018social fact\u2019 in the \n11\nDurkheimian sense: it is not beyond contestation. Although it operates as if absolute, it is \nconstructed, not natural. It cuts across and reshapes social reality, mystifying the process of \nmedia production as a world somehow \u2018apart\u2019 and reifying the vast sector of social life outside \nmedia production as a so-called \u2018ordinary\u2019 domain.  It also masks the complexities of media \nproduction processes themselves. And above all, it disguises, and therefore helps naturalise, the \nfar from natural inequality of symbolic power from which the complex institutional sphere of the \nmedia benefits.  \n \nThis gap -3 between the enormous rhetorical reach of media representations (their claims about \nthe social \u2018whole\u2019) and the partial reality which the media process itself comprises \u2013 is one way \nwe can approach this article\u2019s title: the \u2018hidden injuries of media power\u2019. For if our sense of \u2018the \nmedia\u2019 (as the source of truths about the social) is based on an overvaluation of the media\u2019s \nstatus, then our sense of \u2018the ordinary\u2019 (the ordinary world, the ordinary person) is based on an \nundervaluation: a pervasive devaluation of the ordinary as a site of meaning and value. This \nmight seem paradoxical in an age of reality television (on which more below), until we recall that \nit is mediated versions of the ordinary that generally have our attention, not the sphere of the \n\u2018ordinary\u2019 proper that lies in the shadow of the media\u2019s operations, and which is my main \nconcern.  \n \nIf my argument is correct \u2013 and it is of course a broad hypothesis, for which I have space to \nprovide only limited evidence here \u2013 then it becomes plausible to speak about media power (and \nthe hierarchical distinctions which sustain it) not just as an inequality of resources, but also as a \nsource of \u2018injury\u2019: an injury connected with the pervasive misrecognition of everyday life as \n\u2018merely\u2019 ordinary (not, that is, touched by the \u2018glamour\u2019 of mediation). The idea of media \n12\npower\u2019s \u2018hidden injuries\u2019 draws, then, on Bourdieu\u2019s concept of \u2018symbolic violence\u2019 (Bourdieu, \n1991: 209-212), that is, an inequality imposed not by force, but by consent: consent based on a \nmisrecognition of the social world as already structured to \u2018fit\u2019 that inequality.  \n \nBourdieu himself does not use the term \u2018hidden injuries\u2019 of course, which I take from Sennett \nand Cobb\u2019s (1972) account of how class inequalities are embedded in individuals\u2019 \ncategorisations of the relative worth of themselves and others. Class power \u2013 and the same can be \nargued, I suggest, for media power \u2013 works partly through a mistaking of its arbitrariness for \nsomething natural. In the case of \u2018class\u2019, however, the injury, if not the misrecognition, is fairly \nobvious: people are disadvantaged because they value themselves less, imagining their \nsubordinate position in the distribution of society\u2019s economic resources as somehow justified by \nan underlying moral or psychological  inequality. But where in the case of media power does the \nhidden injury lie? It lies (analogously) in people\u2019s accepting as somehow justified their \nsubordinate position in the distribution of society\u2019s symbolic resources, the ability to speak and \nbe listened to on what matters to the world at large. If I am correct in analysing this as an injury, \nthen it surely has implications for the constitution not only of the political field (cf Couldry, \n2001) but also of the private sphere. \n \nThis at least is my hypothesis but, to develop it, I need to look more closely at how our beliefs \nabout the media are reproduced in practice. We affirm media\u2019s power at a distance, not because \nmedia actually bring us together, but because they construct themselves, and we construct them, \nas if they did. As many recent theories of power4 have suggested, media power, for all its basis in \ninstitutional brute facts (including profound inequalities of access to the means of media \nproduction), is sustained in a dispersed way, through our beliefs and patterns of thought about \n13\nmedia institutions. They not only evidence the fact that we lend legitimacy to media institutions; \nthey are part of the process through which that legitimacy is sustained, and it is this process in \nparticular on which I want to cast some light. \n \nA Research Strategy \n \nHow can we research those beliefs and patterns of thought, the culture of media belief? How can \nwe research the subset of beliefs which sustain the media\/ordinary distinction and hierarchy, that \nI have suggested underlies both media power and the mediated landscape of  everyday \nconsumption? A good entry-point is situations where non-media people and media institutions \nmeet close up, and non-media people\u2019s talk and beliefs about such situations. You might object \nthat the whole point about the media, as institutions of broadcasting, is that such moments are \nrare: the media are precisely communication at a distance. But just because a social process is \nrare does not mean that it is insignificant.  Indeed the fact that non-media people rarely do have \nfree access to media people may itself reveal something about the power disparity between those \ntwo groups, or at least its sources. To take a broader analogy from the study of religion, the fact \nthat many ritual experiences (such as pilgrimage, communion) are rare or ritually controlled, does \nnot make them any less worth studying. On the contrary, such ritual interactions, when they \noccur, tell us a lot about how the social power of religious institutions is more widely \nreproduced.  \n \nIf people\u2019s general attitudes to the media are shaped by their normal separation from the process \nof media production, then their accounts of what happens when (rarely) they see that process \nclose up may bring to the surface precisely the assumptions about media \u2013 the background \n14\nexpectations and judgements which normally remain unarticulated \u2013 that interest us. This, \nbroadly speaking, was how Harold Garfinkel sought to analyse the \u2018background expectancies\u2019 at \nwork in everyday social interaction by studying what happens when those expectancies are \nbreached (Garfinkel, 1984: ch. 1). Let me now pursue this possibility in more detail.  \n \nOn the Track of Media Beliefs \n \nIn this section, I want to introduce some empirical material on media consumption, that does not \ncome from the places where we normally look for evidence of our relationship to the media. It \ndoes not come from the home, still our main site of media consumption, nor even from the \nscattered public sites where we consume media (McCarthy 2001), but from those points in the \nwider landscape of consumption and public action where our beliefs about the media are at issue: \nfirst, voluntary situations, where people choose (for leisure) to visit a place of media production \n(where the connection to the wider consumption landscape is clear), and, second, involuntary \nsituations where people find themselves close to media production, because they are involved in \nevents that are the subject of media coverage (here the connection with consumption is latent but \nemerges below). The first type of situation I label \u2018pilgrimages\u2019 and the second, acts of \n\u2018witnessing\u2019. The half-dead metaphor of \u2018pilgrimage\u2019 has indeed become a clich\u00e9 of media \nreporting on tourism; \u2018witnessing\u2019, by contrast, is a live metaphor for situations where the normal \nhierarchies of the media landscape are encountered in their full arbitrariness. (The terms \n\u2018pilgrimage\u2019 and \u2018witnessing\u2019 are of course ideal types: I am not claiming that they are mutually \nexclusive in everyday practice, or that they are the only forms of engagement with the media \nprocess from the outside.) \n \n15\nThe Media Threshold \n \nAs pilgrimage sites, I studied tourist locations based on sites of media production (such as \ntelevision sets or film locations), in particular visits to Granada Studios Tour, Manchester, home \nof the set of Britain\u2019s longest-running prime time soap, Coronation Street.  \n \nOne of the first things that interested me about Granada Studios Tour (\u2018GST\u2019) was that it was a \nplace where people expended substantial amounts of money and time to see a place that, by \ndefinition, they had already seen countless times on television: the main outside set of a familiar \ntelevision programme.  What is the meaning of such visits? \n \nLet me approach this first through one visitor\u2019s comment on why he would not want to go to an \nexhibition about Coronation Street a few miles away at Britain\u2019s famous seaside resort of \nBlackpool, run by the same entertainment company, Granada, and called predictably \u2018World of \nCoronation Street\u2019:  \n \nI\u2019ve no desire to go, I would hate it, because it\u2019s not the real one. [short laugh] All right, so \npeople could say, \u2018But that [Coronation Street set] isn\u2019t the real one\u2019. But it is, it\u2019s where they \nfilm the outdoor scene, it\u2019s the one where the actors are, where the studios are, where it all \noriginated. Where did Blackpool come into it? (John) \n \nNote that John\u2019s sense that the Coronation Street set, and nothing else, is worth visiting co-exists \nwith his knowing that it is only a set and that others regard it as such. This knowingness fits \nuneasily with the apparent postmodern truth, wittily expressed by Umberto Eco, that we live in a \n16\nworld in which the \u2018completely real\u2019 is identified with the \u2018completely fake\u2019 (Eco, 1986: 7, \nquoted Rojek, 1993: 160). At the same time, there is a sense of \u2018aura\u2019 in John\u2019s comment: aura in \nBenjamin\u2019s broad sense (1968), yet not the aura of something outside the mechanical \nreproduction of filming, but the aura of the place and process of filming itself. This was present \nin many other comments by visitors, for example: \n \nIt\u2019s magic, it\u2019s a great feeling, sitting at home when you watch telly and say I was there! To \nthink you could do that. (woman interviewed on site, original emphasis)  \n \nWe need to unpack this sense of aura a little, and I can describe only a few of its interesting \nimplications. One is the possibility that the set works as a place for ritual performance. Here is \nhow Michael, an Irish fan of the programme, with whom I corresponded, described being on the \nset (he had visited two times, and was planning to return):  \n \nFrom the moment I put my foot on the Street I feel like a star. I start my walk down the Street \nstarting from the \u2018Rovers Return\u2019 [the programme\u2019s pub] to the \u2018corner shop\u2019. I look through \nall the windows and through all the letter boxes. I touch the stone cladding of number 9. (. . .) \nEvery time I walk down the Street I get that same wonderful happy feeling. It is the best thing \nand most wonderful thing I have ever done. (original emphasis) \n \nOr here is John again, describing his sense that he didn\u2019t want to enter the buildings on the set (in \nfact, you can not, which disappointed many other visitors!): \n \nI didn\u2019t think for one minute that I\u2019d be able to get in (. . .) I actually felt privileged just to turn \n17\nthe knob and try to get in [to the Rovers Return pub] (. . .) No, no, it was just brilliant to be \nphotographed outside it.5  \n \nSpecific to this sense of ritual performance is a sense of a ritual boundary, embodied in the set \nand the basis of its ritual status. The boundary in question is that between the world in which \nvisitors usually operate (the \u2018ordinary world\u2019) and the world the set inhabits, the \u2018media world\u2019.  \n \nThe importance of this boundary \u2013 which, as I have already argued, is central to sustaining the \nmedia\/ordinary hierarchy \u2013 emerged elsewhere in my interviews with set visitors in their \nreflections about other occasions when they had approached that boundary. Here is Debbie, a \nprinting-worker in her 20s, talking about a separate occasion when she was walking round \nLiverpool\u2019s old dock area, now transmuted into a heritage site, which at the time was where live \nweather broadcasts on a popular magazine programme, Richard and Judy, were filmed, with the \nforecaster afloat in the dock! \n \n. . . the weather was at twelve o\u2019clock. And there was a big crowd of people (. . .) And out \ncame the cameramen . . . and he starts filming . . . doing the weather (. . .) it was (. . .) a bit \nunbelievable really (. . .) seeing him really like small. Yeah, he\u2019s on the telly, and then actually \nbeing there and like the camera crew are there and you\u2019re thinking, Oh, I wonder if I\u2019ll get on \ntelly (. . .) [one page earlier] I enjoyed seeing that, thinking, Oh Wow! That\u2019s on telly! And \nI\u2019m standing there and . . . Oh Mum, quick! Put on the weather! You know I was standing up \nthere. \n \nIt was the excitement of that moment, Debbie recalled, that started her interest in visiting media \n18\nlocations generally, including GST. Exceptionally, she had found herself \u2018standing up there\u2019: the \nother side of the boundary between media and ordinary worlds. Her words reflect in stark form \nthe normal existence of that boundary: \u2018That\u2019s on telly! And I\u2019m standing there\u2019. As she put it \nelsewhere, summing up the meaning of her visit to GST: \u2018It\u2019s not just somewhere on telly now, \nit\u2019s actually somewhere I\u2019ve been, I\u2019ve actually stood there\u2019.  \n \nThis distance between \u2018media world\u2019 and \u2018ordinary world\u2019 emerged also in the idea that even the \nshortest appearance on television (for example, as an \u2018extra\u2019) can be significant, because it \ncrosses a boundary which embodies a categorical distinction. Peter, a catering worker in his 20s \nfrom the Midlands, had for some time applied unsuccessfully to be an extra on Coronation \nStreet: \n \nI approached Granada [the TV production company, not the manager of GST] (. . .) to be \nan extra. But they won\u2019t let me (. . .) I wouldn\u2019t mind, just going into the Kabin [a shop in \nthe programme] and ordering . . . a paper or something and then walking out, I don\u2019t want \nto speak or anything. Just . . . once to be on television. On the show. I\u2019d be happy then . . . \nI think.  \n \nHowever small and \u2018ordinary\u2019 the action, it would be significant, if it meant having once entered \nthe \u2018media world\u2019. Even doing something ordinary on television (like \u2018ordering a paper\u2019), \nhowever brief, makes a difference. And when Peter did finally appear on television on a talk \nshow, he felt that he had changed in some way: \n \nTotally different now from the way I used to be (. . .) I was so quiet, I never dreamed of \n19\nworking in the bar, I was (. . . ) always in the back scenes, come out on the bar now (. . .) \nIt did change me [appearing on TV] (. . .) I\u2019m in the open now, talk to anybody.  \n \nPatricia Priest\u2019s important study of US talk show participants (Priest 1995, 1996; cf Gamson, \n1998) points in the same direction. Her interviewees commented on the reactions of other people \nonce they had appeared on television: even if they were identified with a group facing public \nhostility, they met positive responses, simply because they had appeared on television. \nParticipants\u2019 feelings of empowerment derived not just from what they had said publicly, but \nfrom the transformative power of television itself: \u2018I felt like I had contributed to society\u2019, \u2018when \nI think I\u2019m useless . . . , I think \u201cBut wait, I have touched these people\u201d\u2019 (quoted, 1996: 74).  Of \ncourse there are differences between speaking on television in the first person and appearing as \nan extra in a fictional programme - thus for most of Priest\u2019s interviewees, the importance of \nmaking a self-disclosure outweighed any specific desire to be on television (1995: 46) - but the \nstructural pattern is similar. Both acts are ways of transforming one\u2019s relation to the \u2018media \nworld\u2019.    \n \nWhile \u2018ordinary viewers\u2019 do appear on television - indeed daytime talk shows and evening \n\u2018reality TV\u2019 are full of them  - it is the normal impossibility of appearing that matters more at the \nlevel of people\u2019s \u2018dispositions\u2019 (Bourdieu, 1977). As one US talk show participant said: \u2018I guess \nthe average American doesn\u2019t think they could ever get on a talk show\u2019 (quoted, Priest, 1996: \n71). Debbie\u2019s experience of herself being on a talk show (as part of the studio audience for the \npopular UK daytime talk show Kilroy) is significant here. In recounting it, she dwelt more on the \nexperience of watching a videotape of the programme back home, than on being on the \nprogramme itself. Watching the tape shocked her: \n20\n \nI thought, God, that\u2019s me, I\u2019m on telly. God, that is so strange [short laugh] (. . .) I \ncouldn\u2019t remember sort of like . . . being there, it just didn\u2019t seem the same watching it on \ntelly, it was totally different (. . .) Or it\u2019s not like telly, it\u2019s like a sort of home video that \nsomeone\u2019s brought round that\u2019s done on a camcorder. You think, God, is that really on \nthe telly? Is there millions of people watching it? Don\u2019t know, I honestly had to tape over \nit in the end, because it was making  me cringe.  \n \nDebbie could not make a credible connection between the two states (being on television and \nbeing at home). She could no longer effectively recall what it felt like to \u2018be there\u2019 on television. \nShe started to doubt the status of the recording: was it just a piece of \u2018home video\u2019 (made entirely \noutside the media world)? In destroying her best evidence of ever crossing the boundary between \nher world and the media world - something which elsewhere she made clear she wanted to do - \nDebbie registered the dislocation caused by the absolute boundary between her \u2018world\u2019 (the \nworld of \u2018home video\u2019) and the \u2018media world\u2019 (the world which \u2018millions\u2019 watch).  \n \n \u2018Her picture in the paper, but her on the corner\u2019 \n \nI want to turn now to the situations of \u2018witnessing\u2019 mentioned earlier, where people involuntarily \ncome up close to the media process. I researched, in particular, people\u2019s experience of protests \nwhich were featured in media coverage, situations far removed from media consumption it might \nseem, but striking for how they consolidate the picture of the mediated symbolic landscape we \ngained from Granada Studios Tour. I will concentrate on interviews conducted with people who \nhad protested at Brightlingsea, one of a number of British ports whose protests combined to \n21\nmake live exports of veal calves and lambs a major issue in the British news agenda in 1995. \nNote that I am deliberately abstracting from the detailed issues of that protest to concentrate on \nparticipants\u2019 reflections on their relation to the protests\u2019 intense media coverage.6  \n \nFor almost every protester at Brightlingsea  - as the media emphasised - this was their first \nexperience of protesting. In fact, people came \u2018in touch\u2019 with a whole other world: of animal \ncruelty, police intimidation, morally questionable business practices, behind-the-scenes \ngovernment influence. At the same time, emerging through all these other factors was a \ndisruptive dimension which the media did not highlight. The events provided protesters with \ntheir first direct experience of the process of media reporting itself.  Protesters suddenly found \nthemselves \u2018subject[s] of media representations as distinct from . . . consumer[s] of media \nimages\u2019.7 Journalists, camera crews, press photographers, satellite transmission dishes - all the \ntrappings of media production on location - were there. Protesters as non-media people were \ninteracting directly with media institutions (or at least their representatives). The shock of seeing \nface-to-face the media process - and realising the gap between media coverage (that of a \npreviously trusted \u2018window onto the world\u2019) and their own direct experience of the protests - \nencouraged many to reflect on their earlier attitudes to the media.  \n \nI want to concentrate on my interview with Rachel, a social services worker in her early 40s. Like \nmany others at Brightlingsea, Rachel reported that she had lost her trust in the media: \n \n[author:] What effect do you think it had on you, being so close to the media? (. . .) \n[Rachel:] I think it completely took away . . . any awe that I may have had . . . respect \nisn\u2019t the right word. \n22\n[author:] Awe rather than respect? (. . .) \n[Rachel:] Yeh, I suppose yeh, because things on the telly aren\u2019t always real, are they? It\u2019s \nall exciting, and it happens to other people, so the opportunity to be right in the midst of it \n. . . didn\u2019t have an effect that if you\u2019d asked me two or three years ago, it might have \ndone. I\u2019d have said, \u2018Ooh, I\u2019d have pushed myself, or I\u2019d hide so that nobody could see \nme\u2019 (. . .) I don\u2019t think my reaction could have been predicted at all (. . .) You know, [I \nwould have said] \u2018I\u2019d have hidden and not had anything to do with it, out of coyness\u2019 or \n\u2018I\u2019d have been really brave and I\u2019d have said something, I\u2019d have told them what I really \nthought\u2019. But it was still with that sort of feeling, [a click sound, indicating surprise] \n\u2018Ooh! these big people have come from the television!\u2019 you know. \n[author:] So what had changed? Why didn\u2019t you feel that this time, do you think? \n[Rachel:] Because they let me down, I think. Because I had enough short term experience \nof what they were doing . . . to feel that . . . they weren\u2019t getting it right. It still needed me \nto tell my friends what was going on (. . .) I think, resentment, that we were totally at their \nmercy, as to whether anything was said at all.  \n \nRachel\u2019s reflections back beyond the time of the protests to her previous attitudes to the media \nare striking.  Previously she had felt more than respect for the media: she had felt \u2018awe\u2019, \nexpressed in her sense of \u2018media people\u2019 as \u2018big people\u2019. \u2018Awe\u2019 is a strong word to use, but it is \nconsistent with her analysis of her likely previous reaction to appearing in the media: either \navoiding the media through nervousness, or \u2018pushing herself\u2019 and \u2018telling them what [she] really \nthought\u2019. Either way, as she sees, she would have been acknowledging a sense of the boundary \nwhich media participation involves: \u2018it was still with that sort of feeling, \u201cOoh, these big people \nhave come from the television!\u201d\u2019.  \n23\n  \nThat sense of a boundary between \u2018media\u2019 and \u2018ordinary\u2019 worlds is another version of the \nboundary we found in people\u2019s reflections on visiting Granada Studios Tour. The implied barrier \nbetween an \u2018ordinary person\u2019 and the media process emerged elsewhere in an interview with \nanother animal rights campaigner, Louise, who began using a camcorder to film maltreatment of \nanimals at a local livestock market. A phrase of Louise\u2019s summed up her feeling of the shift her \ninvolvement in media-related protests represented for herself and others: \n \nIt\u2019s all changed. We\u2019re just ordinary people with no experience of the media or protests or \nanything. (added emphasis) \n \nFor Louise, implicitly, being an \u2018ordinary person\u2019 meant having no experience of the media (or as \nRachel put it, \u2018television\u2019s all exciting and it happens to other people\u2019).  \n \nPerhaps the most vivid sense of that boundary , and its materiality, came when Rachel described \nhow during the protests she saw outside her bedroom window the local \u2018lollipop lady\u20198  \nsurrounded by police for no apparent reason, and then saw a similar photo of her in the UK daily \nnewspaper The Independent: \n \nAnd Sandra the lollipop lady who speaks to us every day and remembers my kids\u2019 names \nand everything, is totally surrounded by uniformed police officers, and she\u2019d done \nnothing, she was standing on the kerb, and it was just so bizarre that Sandra was in the \npaper (. . .) I can\u2019t even describe how utterly inappropriate it was. Because Sandra stands \ndown there, Sandra Jones with her lollipop.  \n24\n     [original emphasis] \n \nRachel had felt genuine anxiety at Sandra\u2019s situation, yet something else breaks through: the \nsense of shock that the \u2018ordinary world\u2019 Rachel inhabited was temporarily part of the \u2018media \nworld\u2019, which everyone in the country could see.  Compare Rachel\u2019s description of seeing her \nfriend\u2019s husband in the paper: \n \nAnd the other picture was again so very very poignant and . . . it just said it all, is \nGeoffrey, who is . . . is just Geoffrey, he\u2019s got two little boys and he\u2019s just normal and he \nworks ever so hard and he\u2019s in a sea of police officers and he\u2019s pointing . . . shouting at \nthem . . . and the futility of it (. . .) But he was so recognisable, you just opened The \nIndependent and there\u2019s Geoffrey in The Independent [laughs] (. . .) It was just so . . . I \ncan\u2019t describe it, but just two . . . very very very very normal boring ordinary people (. . .) \nAnd that for me epitomised it all. Her [Sandra\u2019s] picture in the paper, but her on the \ncorner.   \n \nWhat Rachel \u2018can\u2019t describe\u2019 is the temporary fusion of \u2018ordinary\u2019 and \u2018media\u2019 worlds that \noverrides the normally naturalised boundary between \u2018ordinary\u2019 and \u2018media\u2019 worlds. The shock \nof this - its \u2018impossibility\u2019 - is expressed precisely in the insistent banality of the language \n(Couldry, 2000: 104-105, 196-198; cf Billig, 1997: 225): it was \u2018just Geoffrey\u2019, \u2018just normal\u2019, \n\u2018just two\u2019, \u2018very very very very normal\u2019.  Yet paradoxically this \u2018ordinary world\u2019 had become \nmediated, creating a gap which was strange: \u2018her picture in the paper, but her on the corner\u2019.  In \nthat small word  \u2018but\u2019, the division between media and ordinary worlds is expressed in a \nnaturalised, and therefore uncontestable, form \n25\n \nIt is time now to review the wider implications of this interview material and of the research \nstrategy in the course of which they emerged. \n \nWider Implications   \n \nIn examining media power, and the hierarchy and boundaries which help legitimate it, it has been \nnecessary in the last two sections to focus on the details, first, of the theoretical framework with \nwhich I am working and, second, of how traces of such large-scale patterns can be found in \nempirical evidence of people\u2019s reflections on their encounters with the media process. In \nconcluding, I want to widen my focus considerably and indicate a range of debates where it is \nhelpful to pay attention to the forces that structure the mediated symbolic landscape (which is not \ndetached from, but closely overlaps with, the general landscape of everyday consumption).  \n \nThere is, I have argued, a boundary, regularly legitimated and symbolically effective, between \n\u2018media world\u2019 and \u2018ordinary\u2019 (that is, non-media) \u2018world\u2019, a boundary which is \u2018absolute\u2019 in \nDurkheim\u2019s sense, so that any crossing of it, or even approach to it, is automatically significant. \nIt is because we stand in such a relationship to the media world, that Cecelia Tichi\u2019s apparent \nstatement of fact rings true: \u2018to be transposed onto television is to be elevated out of the banal \nrealm of the off-screen and repositioned in the privileged on-screen world\u2019 (1991: 140, quoted \nPriest, 1996: 80). This boundary condenses a categorical difference which is not simply optional \n\u2013 something we can think with, if we want \u2013 but compulsory, or at least usually compulsory, \nsince naturalised, unless we explicitly work to deconstruct it. As a constructed boundary, it \noperates to distort the actual complexities of the media process. Of course, in practice, media \n26\nproduction draws its personnel and its themes very often from \u2018ordinary\u2019 life, but that does not \nunderline the media\/ordinary boundary, on the contrary it is what makes it all the more \ncompelling as the frame through which (\u2018ordinary\u2019) social life becomes glamorous by virtue of \nbeing mediated. As with all social constructions, the reality underlying the arbitrariness of the \nconstruction is messy. That gap, which the constructed authority of the media\/ordinary boundary \nbridges, may be painful at times, as we have seen. Yet our belief in the legitimacy of that \nboundary (a belief that is odd, when stated so baldly, which is why it rarely is stated so baldly) is \nthe basis of what I have called the \u2018hidden injuries of media  power\u2019.  \n \nIf this argument \u2013 bold and in some respects speculative as it is \u2013 is accepted, then it can help us \ngrasp better various areas of contemporary cultural consumption. First, there is the space of \ncelebrity and fandom, in particular the seemingly endless reinscription of the media\/ordinary \nboundary in new media forms, including the \u2018ordinary\u2019 celebrity who appears to transcend the \nmedia\/ordinary boundary in a move which generally just reinforces its legitimacy: television \ngames such as Big Brother, as played in many countries in 2000 are a good example (Couldry, \nforthcoming). Second, there is the phenomenon of \u2018participatory\u2019 media, which claim legitimacy \nfrom their inclusion of \u2018ordinary people who watch television\u2019:9 talk shows and all forms of \n\u2018reality TV\u2019 from those which simply show clips of surveillance footage (traffic accidents, and so \non) to highly crafted docusoaps organised around a theme from everyday life (in the UK, recent \nexamples would be Hotel, Driving School, and Airport). Underlying all such programmes is a \nfascinating question, which is why people wish to participate in them, in spite of often significant \ncosts. How the media\/ordinary boundary is negotiated varies greatly between these types of \nprogramme, of course, but rarely, I would contend, is it de-naturalised or called into question. \nMore broadly, the idea that the media put us \u2018in touch\u2019 with the \u2018larger\u2019 world (the other side of \n27\nthe \u2018merely\u2019 \u2018ordinary\u2019 world in which we live) structures many consumer phenomena, from the \ngrowth in media-related tourism (such as GST in Britain and Universal Studios in America) to \nthe media-saturated rhetoric of large-scale commercial events. We can hear that rhetoric in \ncomments on Vancouver\u2019s Expo 86, where one visitor spoke of \u2018the wonderful line-ups which \nenabled me to meet the world\u2019 and another reflected that \u2018remembering the time I sang with my \nfriends in front of the world live in a studio was something extraordinary for me\u2019 (quotes from \nLey and Olds, 1992: 188, 190, emphasis added). The symbolic landscape which the media imply \nis a dimension of our \u2018sensuous geographies\u2019 (Rodaway, 1994), which has been insufficiently \nstudied.  \n \nMy argument throughout, however, has been that we must do more than describe the surfaces of \nthe symbolic landscape that media have generated, important though that is. As sociologists \nconcerned with power and the naturalisation of inequality, we need to think about the impacts of \nthe inequalities built into that landscape and entrenched in the media\/ordinary distinction. \nUnderlying his rhetorical excess, Baudrillard\u2019s enduring insight may be to have seen that media \ninstitute \u2018a separation . . . a social division\u2019 (Baudrillard, 1981: 128).To put it crudely, why else \nwould the transition to celebrity (and the games played in celebrity\u2019s border zones) matter so \nmuch?  \n \nAn important qualification is however necessary to my overall argument. I am not saying that the \nmedia\/ordinary boundary is simply reproduced everywhere and evenly (without any possibility of \never being de-naturalised) or denying that there are many ways of living with that boundary, just \nas there are with any other social division. We can play with the boundary, imagining we have \ntransgressed it (for example, by \u2018real life\u2019 actions that pretend to work within the space of media \n28\nfictions: people who send flowers when a soap opera character dies).10 We can fantasise about \ncrossing that boundary (Couldry, 2000: 55-57). We can be ironic or mocking about the boundary. \nAll these are ways of negotiating distance from the media\/ordinary boundary, that at the same \ntime reinstitute it (Bourdieu, 1991: 89-91). As Slavoj Zizek (1989: 33) has argued \u2013 and this \npoint has been neglected in accounts of the \u2018fluidity\u2019 of the postmodern \u2013 \u2018even if we do not take \nthings seriously, even if we keep an ironical distance, we are still doing them\u2019, that is, still \nreproducing the form of the division we claim to mock. There are many ways, as Bourdieu puts \nit, of \u2018loving the inevitable\u2019 (1977: 77). \n \nIn any case, mediation is only one dimension of social reality; it is not its totality and as \nsociologists we must always insist upon this, even as we recognise that it is precisely the media\u2019s \nclaim to represent the social whole that is the basis of their power. Behind that totalising claim, \nthere are many important distinctions which we need to explore further. First, there are the barely \nexplored differences in territories\u2019 cultures of media belief, each territory having its own history \nof relations between state, market, religion, and media. Media power is not the same thing in \nAmerica, Russia, Singapore or the UK and, if we pretend it is, we obscure from view a \npotentially rich field of comparative research. Second, it remains unclear how new media and the \ndigital convergence of media will affect media power: will it lead to its gradual dispersal across a \nflattened landscape of interconnected consumer\/producers, or will it only serve in the long run to \nentrench the symbolic power of a new digital \u2018supermedium\u2019 (Castells, 1996: 358-64)? Will \n\u2018narrowcasting\u2019 become the dominant, not merely a subsidiary feature of the media landscape? \nAs yet we do not know (cf Neuman, 1991). Certainly, in relation to the Internet for example, we \nneed to distinguish the open-ended complexity of Internet practices from the forces which are \nalready consolidating \u2018the Internet\u2019 (Miller and Slater, 2000: 16).  \n29\n \nFinally, and in case we are tempted to dismiss this whole area of research as simply repeating a \nbanal truth that the media are central to our lives, it is worth emphasising that it is precisely the \nbanality of this truth that makes it difficult for us to see it clearly, and still more difficult for us to \ncontest. The banality of media power, and our beliefs which sustain it, have recently been \nreflected, if only in reverse, by a striking case where they were contested. People have recently \nbegun to contest the media-enhanced elision of political space with consumption space (Giroux, \n1999, 2000) in surprising ways. Think of the wide resonance which Naomi Klein\u2019s No Logo \n(2000) has had, even if that book oversimplifies the politics of today\u2019s consumption landscape \n(Hanspal and McRobbie, 2000). As Alberto Melucci, a leading analyst of the changing forms of \nsymbolic conflict (Melucci, 1989, 1996), has put it, only partly exaggerating: \u2018the real \ndomination is today the exclusion from the power of naming\u2019 (1996: 179), that is, naming social \nreality in words, and of course images, which command attention. Such domination cannot \nsimply pass without being contested at some level and Melucci\u2019s insight, far from being banal, \nmay be exactly the incitement we need to grasp the world of media consumption, and \nconsumption more generally, not just as playful surface, but as a true landscape of power whose \ncontours and fissures we have yet to track. \n \nAcknowledgements  \n \nEarlier versions of this paper were delivered to New York University\u2019s Department of Culture \nand Communication in April 2000 and the Media@LSE Research Seminar in February 2001. \nMany thanks to members of each audience for their comments, criticisms, and encouragement. \nThe empirical research on which I draw here was conducted under Economic and Social \n30\nResearch Council grant R004429534066.

For earlier and fundamental perspectives on \u2018media power\u2019 \nin this sense, see Debord (1983), Carey (1989), Hall (1973), Scannell (1996), Silverstone (1988). \n \n2\n I say \u2018largely\u2019 to allow for the multiplication of channels on cable and satellite, and now digital, television. I come \nback to this complication in the conclusion. \n \n3\n Crucial in grasping that gap was the work of Guy Debord (1983) , itself influenced by Herni Lebebvre.  \n \n4\n For example, Callon and Latour (1981), Foucault (1979), Giddens (1984) , Knorr-Cetina (1981). \n \n5\n \u2018(. . .)\u2019 indicates material omitted by the author, \u2018. . .\u2019 indicates a pause by the interviewee.  \n \n6\n See for more detail Benton and Redfearn (1996), Couldry (2000: ch. 7). \n \n7\n Benton and Redfearn (1996: 58). \n \n8\n A colloquial English term for a woman who is employed to stop the traffic to allow children to cross the road. \n \n9\n A phrase used by an interviewee of Livingstone and Lunt (1994: 119). \n37\n                                                                                                                                                             \n \n10\n Thanks to Roger Silverstone (personal conversation) for suggesting this interpretation of such easily maligned \nactions (see also Couldry, 2000: 107-8 on playing at transgression). \n"}
