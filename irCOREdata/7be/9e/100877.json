However, while the data for A\u0001 193 are\nrelatively complete, for heavier masses few medium- or high-\nspin levels have been reported. The reasons are twofold. By\n197Au, the only stable gold nuclide, the isotopes are beyond the\nreach of conventional heavy-ion fusion\u2013evaporation reactions.\nSecond, deep-inelastic reactions (see, e.g., Ref. [3]) have the\ndrawback that often it is not possible to uniquely identify\nthe isotope or element to which populated de-excitations\nbelong. Therefore, while a decay scheme may be relatively\nstraightforward to construct, for it to be assigned correctly,\nother, complementary data are frequently required. Such is\nthe case here in which we observe a newly placed three-hole\nisomer decay in 19779 Au. This was made possible following the\nrecent comprehensive publication by Fotiades et al. [4] of the\nlow-spin states in 197Au using (n, n\u2032\u03b3 ) reactions.\nA thin, 420-\u00b5g cm\u22122, self-supporting target of 19878 Pt was\nbombarded with an 850-MeV 13654 Xe beam provided by the\n88\u201d cyclotron at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.\n\u2217Corresponding author: wheldon@hmi.de; URL: http:\/\/www.hmi.\nde\/people\/wheldon\/\n\u2020Present address: Istituto Nazionale di F\u0131\u00b4sica Nucleare (INFN),\nLaboratori Nazionali di Legnaro, Italy.\n\u2021Present address: TRIUMF, 4004 Wesbrook Mall, Vancouver,\nBritish Columbia, V6T 2A3 Canada.\n\u00a7Present address: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,\nLivermore, California 94551, USA.\n\u00b6Present address: Institut fu\u00a8r Strahlen und Kernphysik, Universita\u00a8t\nBonn, Nussallee 14-16, D-53115 Bonn, Germany.\n||Deceased.\nGamma rays were detected using the GAMMASPHERE array\nconsisting of 102 Compton-suppressed germanium detectors\nfor this experiment and heavy-ion recoils were stopped in\nthe CHICO gas-filled PPAC ancillary detector [5]. The event\ntrigger condition required two co-planar CHICO elements and\nat least three germanium detectors to fire within 670 ns. Further\nsoftware time conditions demanded that the first three \u03b3 rays be\nin prompt coincidence, within \u00b145 ns of the CHICO detection of\nthe two recoils. However, subsequent \u03b3 -rays could be delayed\nby up to 670 ns, allowing both prompt (Doppler corrected) and\nout-of-beam (uncorrected) events to be recorded. (Note that\nthe beam had a natural pulsing period of 178 ns.) A detailed\ndescription of the analysis can be found in Ref. [6].\nThe SORT-SHELL software [7] was used to construct a\nvariety of multidimensional histograms. Those relevant to the\ncurrent work are\n(i) \u03b3 -\u03b3 -delayed, out-of-beam \u03b3 rays arriving between 45 and\n670 ns after the first three prompt \u03b3 -ray signals;\n(ii) prompt-delayed-\u03b3 -\u03b3 for which the x axis is incremented\nwith out-of-beam \u03b3 rays and the y axis with prompt \u03b3\nrays, Doppler corrected for platinum-like recoils;\n(iii) the corresponding matrix with Doppler corrected \u03b3 rays\nfrom xenon-like products on the y axis;\n(iv) prompt-\u03b3 -\u03b3 with prompt \u03b3 rays, Doppler corrected for\nplatinum-like products on both axes; and\n(v) \u03b3 -time for extracting isomeric decay half-lives.\nThe RADWARE analysis package [8] was used to project\nand view background subtracted, gated spectra.\nOne of the most intensely populated out-of-beam cascades\nobserved in this experiment consists (in order of increasing\nexcitation energy) of the transitions 357.7, 639.7, 429.2,\n261.1, and 435.6 keV shown in Fig. 1 (top), all in mutual\ncoincidence.

The latter being the transition depopulating\nthe highest reported spin state in this nucleus. A half-life of\nt1\/2 = 150(5) ns is obtained for the newly observed isomeric\nstate by fitting the time spectrum shown in Fig. 2.\nFIG. 2. Time spectrum gated by the 261-, 358-, 436-, and\n640-keV transitions in 197Au (data points) from which the half-life\n(solid line), t1\/2 = 150(5) ns, is obtained.\nThe ordering of the two higher-lying, 261- and 436-keV\ntransitions could not be established solely from the out-of-\nbeam GAMMASPHERE data. However, data from an earlier\nexperiment obtained using the same reaction at 780 MeV with\nthe 8\u03c0 detector array at Berkeley was used to tie down the\nordering to that given above. Transitions up to and including\nthe 261-keV transition were observed, but not the 436-keV\ndecay, which was beyond the sensitivity of the 8\u03c0 setup.\nThese data were obtained using a thick, 7-mg cm\u22122 198Pt\ntarget backed by 50-mg cm\u22122 natPb. Details of the experiment\nand analysis technique can be found in Ref. [9].\nIn addition to the intense transitions discussed above,\nother weaker out-of-beam coincidences have been observed.\nA 1069.2-keV transition is found to be in coincidence with\nall but the 429- and 640-keV de-excitations. This leads to\nits placement as the ( 212\n+) \u2192 ( 152\n\u2212), (E3) transition. It is\nnoteworthy that this 1069-keV decay, observed here with a\npartial \u03b3 -ray intensity of 0.02(1), is not reported in Ref. [4].\nFurther, much weaker coincidences between the intense\ncascade and a 763.0-keV \u03b3 ray have been identified, implying a\nsecond isomer, either more weakly populated or with a half-life\n\u00041 \u00b5s. (A second, even weaker transition at 875 keV, showing\ncoincidences similar to those of the 763-keV decay remains\nunplaced.) Both the 763- and 875-keV energies are coincident\nwith all of the intense transitions, distinguishing them from\nstronger contaminant decays (Figs. 1 and 3).\nFollowing the projection of the prompt transitions in\ncoincidence with the 640-keV out-of-beam decay, the cascade\nenergies (relative \u03b3 -ray intensities) 328 (54), 548 (51), and 465\n(19) keV were observed to lie above the isomer, together with\ntwo additional prompt transitions at 264 (7) and 769 (27) keV\n027303-2\nBRIEF REPORTS PHYSICAL REVIEW C 74, 027303 (2006)\nFIG. 3. Out-of-beam \u03b3 -ray spectrum gated\nby the 261-keV transition in 197Au showing the\n1069-keV (E3) transition (inset). Contaminants,\nlabeled c, are from 182W.\n[Fig. 1 (middle)]. This relationship was confirmed by project-\ning the delayed transitions from a prompt gate at 328 keV, as\nshown in Fig. 1 (bottom). Gold K x-rays have been identified\nin all of the spectra in Figs. 1 and 3. The level scheme resulting\nfrom this analysis is shown in Fig. 4.\nComparison with lighter odd-A gold nuclei suggests the\npossibility of an unidentified low-energy transition directly\ndepopulating the isomeric state. Low-energy transitions are\nknown to directly depopulate the I\u03c0 = 312\n+ isomers in 191Au\n(67 keV) and 189Au (39 keV) [1]. In the current work the limits\nfor such a decay to be unobserved are E\u03b3 < 85 keV (E2),\n<69 keV (M1), and <45 keV (E1) [10] and would lead to an\nisomer with a spin of \u2248 312 h\u00af. In the absence of such a low-energy\ntransition the 436-keV decay would directly depopulate the\nisomer. In such a scenario, based on the Weisskopf single-\nparticle estimate, multipolarities higher than \u03bb = 2 would lead\nto Weisskopf hindrance factors, FW =\n(\nt\nexpt.\n1\/2 \/t\nWeiss.\n1\/2\n)\n<1, and\nFIG. 4. Partial level scheme for 197Au as obtained in the current\nwork. Half-lives are shown for some states. Tentative level energies\n(in parentheses) indicate the possibility of an unobserved low-energy\ntransition feeding the 2532-keV state. The widths of the arrows below\nthe isomeric levels (thick lines) are proportional to the intensities.\nLevel information for the known levels (up to 1836 keV) is taken\nfrom Refs. [2,4]. The 150-ns half-life may belong to the 2532-keV\nlevel or to another, higher-lying state (not shown) de-exciting by a\nlow-energy, unobserved transition.\nwould therefore not be allowed. Considering an intermediate\nstate of either I\u03c0 = 232 or 252 suggests possible spins of\nI\u03c0 = 252 \u2192 292 for the newly observed isomer, in the absence\nof any additional (unobserved) low-energy decay.\nThe configurations measured or suggested (based on the\navailable orbitals) for the higher-spin states are given in Table I,\nincluding the newly observed levels in 197Au. Considering the\navailable neutron orbitals in this region a change in structure\nmay na\u0131\u00a8vely be expected around 197Au, beyond which the\n[\u03bdi13\/2\u2297\u03bdh9\/2]10\u2212 coupling will move to relatively higher\nexcitation energies due to the increasing Fermi level as the\nneutron closed shell is approached. A second manifestation of\nthis effect will be the favoring, at higher spins, of the \u03bdi\u2212213\/2\ncouplings to the h11\/2 proton hole, leading to configurations\nwith I\u03c0 = 332\n\u2212\nand 352\n\u2212\n, one of which may de-excite via the\nweak 763-keV out-of-band decay observed here. Whether\nthis point has been reached will become clear following\ncharacterization of the states observed here and further study\nof 195Au (see also below).\nThe provisional E3, ( 212\n+) \u2192 ( 152\n\u2212) transition at 1069 keV\nis consistent with a nanosecond (or shorter) half-life based on\nthe relative branching intensity (0.02(1)) and the Weisskopf\nsingle-particle estimate, though no intermediate lifetime was\nobserved. This and the E3 systematics for the lighter odd-A\nisotopes are shown in Table II. In addition to 197Au, previously\nTABLE I.

For\n191Au a 1304-keV, (E3) transition was newly identified here\nwith a branching ratio of approximately 10%. Furthermore,\nwhile the corresponding 1380-keV transition in 189Au was\nnot observed, it was possible to obtain an upper limit on the\nrelative intensity of <10% in the current work. The 10-ns\nupper limit for the half-life of the I\u03c0 = 212 state in 197Au is\nconsistent with the corresponding lifetimes in the lighter odd-A\nisotopes.\nThe bandheads of the decoupled \u03c0h\u2212111\/2 prolate structures\nform isomeric states in the odd-A isotopes because of the large\ndifference in spin compared to the \u03c0d3\/2 ground states. The se-\nries of I\u03c0 = 212\n+\nstates are explained as couplings between the\n[\u03bdi13\/2\u2297\u03bdp3\/2]5\u2212 configurations and the h11\/2 proton hole [12].\nIn addition to 197Au, there is evidence of a previously\nunreported 481.5-keV transition in 195Au in the out-of-beam\n\u03b3 -\u03b3 matrix. This transition feeds the known I\u03c0 = ( 212\n+), 8-ns,\n1813-keV level [12]. A half-life, other than that in agreement\nwith the 8-ns intermediate lifetime, could not be obtained in the\ncurrent work and the 482-keV transition itself is too heavily\ncontaminated to allow a direct measurement, free from the\n8-ns feeding.\nIn summary, the de-excitation of an isomer in 197Au was\nnewly observed and a half-life of 150(5) ns measured following\ndeep-inelastic reactions between an 850-MeV 136Xe beam\nand a 198Pt target. Prompt, higher lying transitions have also\nbeen identified. The assignment of this isomer to 197Au was\npossible due to the availability of recent results from (n, n\u2032\u03b3 )\nwork. In addition, a new out-of-beam transition is reported\nin 195Au.\nThe technical staff at Lawrence Berkeley National Labo-\nratory are acknowledged for providing a high-quality beam.\nDr. Tzany Kokalova is thanked for helpful comments and\ndiscussions. This work is supported by the UK EPSRC, the\nUS DOE under Grants DE-FG02-91ER-40609 and DE-AC03-\n76SF00098, and the US NSF. P. H.
