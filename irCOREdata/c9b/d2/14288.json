Brooksbank, A. Clark, R. Hamilton and D. G. Pickernell\nThe Business School, University of Glamorgan. Email: aclark\/@glam.ac.uk.\nThis is an extended review of WinEcon, a CAL package for introductory economics. Our\ncomments are based on a survey of staff and students involved in the first large-scale (n =\n300+) attempt to integrate WinEcon into a teaching and assessment programme.\nThe WinEcon project\nWinEcon is a Windows-based introductory Economics CAL package designed for use in\nhigher education. It is the product of the Economics Consortium of the TLTP (Teaching\nand Learning Technology Programme) consisting of eight university Economics\ndepartments. Each of these has been responsible for producing some of the 25 chapters\n(tutorials) of the finished product. Content is based on covering the common core of\nintroductory Economics as revealed by a survey of higher-education Economics depart-\nments. WinEcon is provided, with an accompanying workbook, for a nominal registration\nfee in the UK. The package is important insofar as it is aimed at all first-year\nundergraduates studying Economics, which encompasses not only those taking straight\nEconomics degrees but large numbers of students following introductory Economics as\npart of a Business Studies or Combined Studies course. With no competition to speak of,\nWinEcon is likely to become a significant feature of the learning experience of a large\ntranche of the undergraduate population, across a number of degree schemes. Indeed, for\nmany of these students WinEcon will constitute their first major experience of CAL.\nIntegrating WinEcon\nIt is intended that WinEcon, like all TLTP products, should be integrated into teaching\nprogrammes to such an extent that it becomes an indispensable learning resource.\nAlthough, as Jacobs (1996) points out, TLTP products have had less success in this aim\nthan was hoped, we decided from the outset to give WinEcon a central role in our\ncurriculum by locating it within a cycle of 'wanting, doing, feedback, and digestion' (Race,\n1994). The initial motivation would come from our pioneering use of WinEcon's\n47\nD.J. Brooksbank et al A critical appraisal of WinEcon and its use in a first-year undergraduate Economics programme\nand what the learning objectives are. None of these is a feature of WinEcon. This may be a\nsin of omission, but it could also be that, with few words to play with, making links may\nhave been seen as a luxury that the authors could not afford. It would then be an\nunderstandable, but none the less significant, sin of omission, and would, again, be\nindicative of the difficulties entailed in putting a textbook on a screen. It may also reflect\nthe fact that with many authors working in relative isolation, the co-ordination of ideas\nmay have become onerous. In addition, the lack of interaction in WinEcon means that the\nonly effective control students have over their learning is to adjust the pace at which they\nwork through the text. This is a type of control, but it does not involve the level of control\nand of mutual re-adaptation that experienced teachers use in a tutorial setting. So,\nalthough WinEcon is referred to as a tutorial system, what it provides does not equate to\nour current tutorial practices, or the definitions of such that are used in educational\nliterature. For example, for Laurillard (1993, p. 152) the key feature of a tutorial is\nadaptation, hence to imitate this a package needs to use 'the students' performance on\nprevious tasks to decide what tasks should be set next, without which it is not a tutorial'.\nPrograms that do this are often referred to as 'intelligent teaching programs'. Creating this\nkind of 'intelligence' requires not just subject knowledge but also an understanding of how\nstudents learn, an aspect of the production of effective CAL that we feel has been largely\noverlooked in the WinEcon case. These criticisms are supported by students' feedback, for\ndespite the fact that WinEcon is referred to as a 'tutorial program', 81 per cent of students\ndid not believe that it should replace classroom tutorials.\nOur third reason for believing that WinEcon could lead to enhanced learning was that it\nwould add to variety in the learning experience by providing something that might\notherwise not have been available, given institutions' reluctance to invest in CAL. WinEcon\nlived up to expectations in this respect: it is colourful and well written, so that 57 per cent\nof students felt that it explained difficult topics well.\nFinally, we envisaged the possibility that improved learning could result directly from the\nfreeing of staff time that substitution by machine could produce, since this time would\nhave been used for educational development. Although few such benefits have materialized\nas yet, we anticipate that benefits of this kind will do so in future as we (and the pro-\ngrammers of WinEcon) move along the learning curve in applying this package.\nConclusions\nWe found that WinEcon was welcomed as an additional source of information by students,\nbut it did not provide the level of learner interaction or learner control that staff had\nanticipated, which - once the novelty had worn off - led to student dissatisfaction too. To\nunderstand its failings in terms of the learning process, we need to consider the\npedagogical philosophy underlying WinEcon: the lack of interaction, the form of the\ninteraction, the linearity of the discourse, and the overall pedagogical style of the package\nare indicative of a 'transmission of knowledge' approach to teaching, where unproblematic\ninformation - that exists sui generis - is transmitted to the receptive student, so that\n'content knowledge and fluent presentation are enough for good teaching' (Ramsden,\n1991, p. 116). This approach tends to play down the importance of barriers to learning,\nsuch as students' misconceptions, and largely ignores their ex ante understandings of\ntopics, and how they integrate the information; in short, how they learn.\n50\nALT-J Volume 6 Number 3\nIn contrast, we believe a well-designed package should reflect what has been learned about\nthe way students learn, and be responsive to their current conceptions of the subject\nmatter. As Laurillard (1994, p. 187) argues: 'it is impossible for teaching to succeed if it\ndoes not address the current forms of students' understanding of a subject'. This\nunderstanding will enable the author to engage in a dialogue with the learner and\nincorporate programmed responses to misconceptions if they arise. To incorporate all\npossible misconceptions in a computer program may seem an impossible task, but these\nmisconceptions are not random, or necessarily extensive, as knowledge and understanding\nare constructed in well-researched psychological and social contexts. Moreover, the student\ninterfaces with a relatively static body of knowledge at this level in Economics, in a process\nthat is replicated in many institutions, and within the same institution time after time. The\nresult is plain from discussions of shared experience among Economics lecturers: there are\na few key recurring misconceptions that are encountered in teaching introductory\nEconomics. Moreover, many of these have been identified in the educational literature (see,\nfor example, Dahlgren, 1984). None of the main ones that have been identified are\naddressed in WinEcon, which may help to explain why so many students felt that a\nteacher's presence was needed when using it, and why heavy use was made of the teachers\nwho did supervise the sessions.\nThe type of feedback provided by WinEcon is also indicative of the transmission approach\nin two respects. First, there is the predominant use of multiple-choice questioning, which is\ntypical of the transmission approach as it serves to check that the message has been\nreceived. Such assessment is based on how much, and how accurately, information is\nknown rather than what is understood, whereas a more student-centred approach focuses\non what is understood and is typically assessed using case studies, reports, and problem-\nsolving tasks. Using the typology of MacDonald et al. (1976) quoted in Somekh (1996), we\nargue that WinEcon seldom goes beyond the recognition and recall types of interaction,\nand thus provides little 'constructive' learning. Secondly, the feedback in WinEcon is of the\n'No, because . . .' (or often just plain 'No') type commonly referred to as extrinsic feed-\nback. The problem with this is that, again, it fails to address conceptual misunderstanding,\nas Laurillard (1993) argues. To uncover misunderstanding, intrinsic feedback is necessary\nas well, that is feedback that arises not as a description of the appropriateness of an input,\nbut rather as the product of the interaction with the conceptual model to the extent that\nthe learning process is conditional on that input. Learning is then experienced from\ninteraction with the conceptual model being taught rather than descriptions of it.\nWe recognize that in the case of introductory Economics, the learning process cannot be\nindividualized to the extent that the student determines what Plowman (1992) calls the\n'path of disclosure', as this can obscure the prerequisite nature of consecutive ideas, and '\nuse of terms, in this subject area. However, as Entwistle and Ramsden (1983) show,\nteaching shapes students' approaches to learning, even their meta-cognitive strategies. So,\nto the extent that the student's approach to the learning process is malleable and\nconditional on the context, WinEcon will reinforce desires for a linear, non-discursive,\napproach. Indeed research with a sub-group of students employing a deep-learning\napproach (cf. Marton and Saljo, 1976; 1984) showed that they became more dissatisfied\nwith WinEcon than other students, and tended to resort to flicking through pages. This\nlack of interest is atypical of such a group whom we would expect to engage relatively\n51\nD.J. Bmoksbank et al A critical appraisal ofWinEcon and its use in a first-year undergraduate Economics programme\ndeeply with the subject matter and maintain high levels of interest, and academic success\n(see van Rossum and Schenk, 1984; Trigwell and Prosser, 1991; Watkins and Hattie, 1985).\nOur responsibility in conducting this review is to appraise the likely returns to investing in\nWinEcon, for although it is essentially free of charge to users, we must consider the time,\neffort, and associated opportunity costs, as time spent using WinEcon is time not spent\nengaged in other learning activities. In doing this, we recognize that CAL is not a panacea\nfor all teaching in the future. None the less, we have to report that both staff and students\nfound WinEcon uninspiring. This is a pity, since for many students it means that their first\nmajor experience of CAL is unlikely to be a happy one.\nReferences\nDahlgren, L. O.
