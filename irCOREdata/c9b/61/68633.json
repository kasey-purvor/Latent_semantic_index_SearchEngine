The results\nare compared to recent predictions based on the theory of the logarithmic\nsusceptibility. Possible applications are discussed.\nThe phenomenon of resonant activation \u2013 a field-induced resonant reduction of the lifetime\nof a metastable state \u2013 was originally observed in a current-biased Josephson junction [1].\nThis observation stimulated a wide-ranging discussion [2, 3, 4, 5] of the old theoretical\nproblem of escape from a potential well in the presence of a nonadiabatic driving field,\ni.e. a field whose frequency is comparable with, or higher than, the natural frequency of\noscillation in the bottom of the well (or the reciprocal relaxation time for an overdamped\nsystem). Under these conditions, the system is unable to respond fast enough to the\nfield to remain in equilibrium with it. The main conclusion was, at first sight, a not\nunreasonable one: the high-frequency field would increase the effective temperature of\nthe system. However, experimentally measured field-induced corrections to the log of the\nactivation rate, lnW , were found [5] to be \u221d A over a wide range of field amplitude A,\nin marked contrast with the \u221d A2 implied by the intuitively appealing physical picture of\nfield-induced heating. No explanation could be given to this effect at that time.\nRecently a new theory has emerged based on the notion of the logarithmic susceptibility\n(LS) [6, 7], able to account for these observations. Furthermore, it also predicts new\nmechanisms of resonant rectification and a current reversal with changing parameters for\nmotion in a spatially periodic asymmetric potential, i.e. a ratchet.\n1\nPublished in Phys. Lett. A 273, 316-321 (2000).\nIn this Letter, we use numerical simulations to investigate resonant activation, resonant\nrectification of fluctuations, and current reversal of an underdamped Brownian particle in\na ratchet potential. We show that the results obtained are broadly in agreement with the\npredictions of the LS theory \u2013 which until now has remained largely untested by either\nexperiment or numerical simulation \u2013 and we discuss the origins of some discrepancies\nbetween theory and experiment. The model investigated was\nx\u00a8+ 2\u0393x\u02d9+ U \u2032(x) = A cos(\u2126t) + \u03be(t), (1)\n\u3008\u03be(t)\u3009 = 0, \u3008\u03be(t)\u03be(0)\u3009 = 4kT\u0393\u03b4(t),\nwhere U(x+L) = U(x) is a ratchet potential of form U(x) = \u03b1 sin(x) + \u03b2 sin(2x+ \u03c6). A\nsimilar model was recently considered in the contexts of quantum ratchets with x(t) being\nthe coordinate operator (restricted to the adiabatic limit) [8] and voltage rectification by\na SQUID ratchet (restricted to the overdamped limit) [9].\nThe quantities of primary interest were the period-averaged activation rates W\u00b1 for\ntransitions to the right (+) and to the left (\u2212), the net current i.e. the rate of rectification\nof fluctuations J = L(W+\u2212W\u2212), and the activation energies S\u00b1. In the T \u2192 0 limit noise-\ninduced escape from a potential well is governed by the slowest decaying eigenmode of\nthe Fokker-Planck operator corresponding to (1). In this limit the activation rate should,\nto leading order, take the WKB form W\u00b1 \u221d exp(\u2212S\u00b1\/kT ) where S\u00b1 is the activation\nenergy [11]. We have investigated system (1) for a few set of parameters. Here we present\nresults for the particular shape of potential U(x) = 0.1 sin(x) + 0.049 sin(2x + 0.2) with\n\u0393 = 0.1. It is shown by the bold curves in Fig. 1.\nThe simulations used a predictor-corrector method of integration and a high-speed\npseudo-random generator [10] for the increment \u2206x. The simulation ran continuously, and\nthe period-averaged rates of escape W\u00b1 were determined from measurements of the mean\ntimes \u3008t\u3009 to reach the bottom of the neighboring potential well (so that the probability\nof returning to the vicinity of original well was negligibly small). The activation energies\nS\u00b1 were then extracted from the measured temperature dependences of W\u00b1 (e.g. inset of\nFig. 2).\nThe main results are shown by the data plotted in Figs. 2 and 3. There are several\npoints to be noted. First, the simulations have yielded linear dependences on the ampli-\n2\ntude A of the field-induced corrections \u03b4S\u00b1 to the activation energy S\u00b1 over a wide range\nof parameters (Fig. 3), as expected from the LS theory; but there are deviations from\nlinearity at large and very small A. Secondly, \u03b4S\u00b1 are clearly different for transitions\nto the right and to the left, immediately implying a rectification of the fluctuations (see\nbelow). Thirdly, the resonant character of the field-induced activation is clearly demon-\nstrated (filled circles in Fig. 2) for transitions to the right, though less convincingly for\nthose to the left (diamonds). Finally, the shape of the former resonance curve is highly\nasymmetric: \u03b4S\u00b1 tend (Fig. 2) at low frequencies towards the constant values correspond-\ning to the change of the activation barrier in the static field whereas, for high frequencies,\n\u03b4S\u00b1 drop to 0 relatively fast; the data are consistent with, but do not resolve, a weak\nadditional peak at frequencies close to 1.\nTo account for these results we recall that, when the temperature is small, a transition\nbetween the potential wells occurs as the result of a large rare fluctuation. Because of the\nconstraint on the particle dynamics imposed by the deterministic equations of motion,\nthere is a special energetically optimal way [12] for the fluctuations to drive the particle to\nthe top of the potential barrier, known as the most probable escape path (MPEP). This\npath is experimentally observable [13, 14]. In thermal equilibrium, it is the time-reversed\ndeterministic relaxational path x\u00b1(t) down to the potential minimum at xs, starting from\nthe left (\u2212) or right (+) adjacent maximum at x\u00b1u [12, 13, 14] (see Fig. 1). Thus, x\n\u00b1(t)\nare given by the solutions of the deterministic equation\nx\u00a8\u00b1 \u2212 2\u0393x\u02d9\u00b1 + U \u2032(x\u00b1) = 0, (2)\nx\u00b1(t) = x\u00b1u for t = 0, x\n\u00b1(t) = xs for t = +\u221e,\nand the activation energy for escape is equal to the difference between the maximum and\nminimum values of the potential, S0 = U(x\n\u00b1\nu )\u2212 U(xs).\nAddition of the driving force breaks time-reversal symmetry and, in general, the\nnonequilibrium MPEP then has to be found numerically by solution of e.g. a variational\nproblem [6]. According to the LS theory[6, 7], if the driving field is not too strong, the\ndeviation of the path away from x\u00b1(t) can be neglected (see Fig. 1 and the discussion\nbelow). To leading order, the changes in activation energy are given by the maximal work\nthe force does on the system as it moves along the equilibrium paths so that, for (1)\n3\nS\u00b1 = S0 + \u03b4S\n\u00b1, \u03b4S\u00b1 = \u2212A|\u03c7\u02dc(\u2126)|,\n\u03c7\u02dc(\u2126) =\n\u222b\n\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\ndt \u03c7\u00b1(t)ei\u2126t, \u03c7\u00b1(t) = \u2212x\u02d9\u00b1(t). (3)\nIt can be seen that the susceptibility \u03c7\u02dc(\u2126) is given by the Fourier transform of the velocity\nx\u02d9\u00b1(t) of the system when travelling along the MPEP in the absence of driving. Since\n\u03b4S\u00b1, i.e. the changes of the logarithms of the escape rates W\u00b1, are proportional to A\nand are expressed in terms of the system characteristics in equilibrium the coeficient of\nproportionality is called the logarithmic susceptibility [6, 7] by analogy with standard\nlinear susceptibility.\nGiven the WKB-like activation law for the escape probabilities (see above), it is clear\nthat, although \u03b4S\u00b1 are small, the field-induced corrections to the escape probabilities\ndepend upon the field amplitude exponentially strongly in the limit T \u2192 0. When the\nsystem fluctuates close to an unstable periodic state, it will remain there for a time ex-\nceeding the field period. Thus, in contrast to the adiabatic case, the transition probability\nis not synchronized with the field, and does not depend on time [15].\nThe results of calculations based on (2) are indicated by the full and dotted curves in\nFigs. 2 and 3. It is evident that all the main qualitative features of the simulations are\nreproduced by the LS theory. For transitions to the right, there is good agreement between\nexperiment and simulation over the full frequency range. For transitions to the left there\nis of course good agreement in the adiabatic range (Fig. 3(a)), apart from a small offset\nassociated with the prefactor, but definite disagreement (Fig. 3(b)) for higher frequencies\ncorresponding to the range for which there is a marked deviation of the dispersion of\n\u03b4S\u2212\/A from the theoretical curve (c.f. Fig. 2).\nThe deviation from a linear dependence of \u03b4S\u00b1 on A at small amplitudes was also\nobserved in earlier experiments [5], but an explanation in terms of the dependence of the\nprefactor on noise amplitude was given only recently [15]: for the theory to be applicable\nwithout corrections, the field-induced changes to the activation energy must be larger\nthat the uncertainty due to the finiteness of the temperature. This idea is being tested\nexperimentally by measurement of \u03b4S\u00b1 in different temperature ranges. The deviation\nfrom \u03b4S\u00b1 \u221d A at large A is caused mainly from going beyond the range of applicability\n(\u03b4S\u00b1 \u226a S\u00b1) of the theory. These results will be discussed in detail elsewhere [18].\n4\nThe most interesting and important features of resonant activation in a spatially asym-\nmetric potential are probably the predictions [6] of resonant rectification of the fluctuations\nand current reversal. The occurrence of these phenomena in the simulations can immedi-\nately be inferred from the frequency and amplitude dependences of the activation energies\nof transitions in opposite directions. Direct measurements of the rectification rate, i.e. of\nthe net current, are shown in Fig. 4(a), clearly demonstrating both resonance and current\nreversal for two different temperatures. As expected from the WKB approximation for\nthe escape probabilities, the current rises exponentially with temperature.\nHowever, the efficiency of the rectification, defined as the net current J normalized by\nthe sum of the currents in both directions, i.e. (W+\u2212W\u2212)\/(W++W\u2212), is better for low\ntemperatures as can be seen from Fig. 4(b). Thus if we have e.g. to transport particles\nfrom one side of the ratchet to the other, as in the case of diffusion of cold Rubidium\natoms in an asymmetric optical lattice [16] or surface electromigration [17], the process\nworks faster at higher temperatures, but more particles will then be traveling in the wrong\ndirection. Neglecting the dependences of the prefactors on parameters and temperature,\nwe can compare the efficiency of the rectification with theoretical predictions. It can\nbe seen from Fig. 4(b) that the agreement is semi-quantitative: as expected, the effect\nis much weaker then predicted for the range of frequencies between 0.3 and 0.4 where\ndeviations of \u03b4S\u2212 from the theory are most pronounced.\nTo try to account for the disagreement we note, first, that the transitions to the right\nand to the left were measured independently and that the temperature was low enough\nthat the transition time was always exponentially smaller then the escape time. Thus\nthe possibility of mutual interference between transitions to the right and to the left\nwas excluded. We have also investigated possible effects of the stochastic layer near the\nsaddles which can in principle annihilate the difference between left and right [20]: for\nour parameters the effect is insignificant, and no direct transitions between saddles were\nobserved. For the LS theory to be applicable, kT has to be the smallest parameter of\nthe problem. Thus for the fluctuations to \u201cfeel\u201d the difference in the shape of the MPEP\nin opposite directions, kT should be smaller than the characteristic energy loss between\nturning points of the MPEP, which \u221d \u0393. Temperatures above \u223c0.05 tend to eliminate\nthe asymmetry of the transition rates, the selective effect of the potential is washed\nout, and the rectification rate falls (see also e.g. [19]). Even at lower temperatures, the\n5\nsharp resonances predicted by the theory are found to be smeared out in the numerical\nsimulations (dotted curve v. open circles data) in Fig. 2.\nIt is evident from the data in Figs. 2 and Fig. 3(b) that the effect of finite temperature\nis apparently different in the two directions. The origin of this difference must presumably\nlie in the dynamics of fluctuations along the actual escape trajectories (see Fig. 1) and\nis apparently associated with the potential barrier for transitions to the left having a\npoint of inflection. It can be seen in Fig. 1 that the MPEP to the left moves very close\nto the potential and therefore experiences critical slowing down. The effect is local in\ncoordinate, but it is not local in time. In this region even small deviations of the escape\npath away from x\u2212(t) result in significant changes of activation energy and must be taken\ninto account as corrections to (3). In general, one may expect the theory to work best in\ncases where (as for transitions to the right, c.f. Fig. 2) there are no very sharp features\nin the shape of the potential. For example, we would expect the theory to work without\ncorrection for the smooth asymmetric potential used in the experiments on the diffusion\nof cold Rubidium atoms [16].\nIn conclusion, we have observed resonant rectification of fluctuations for weakly damped\nmotion in a Brownian ratchet. The LS theory provides a satisfactory description of the\nobserved phenomena, but it can become only semi-quantitative near sharp features in the\ndispersion of \u03b4S\u00b1, apparently because these are rounded by the necessarily finite noise\nintensity, or by the small deviations of the MPEP from the path in thermal equilibrium.\nNote that the effects considered here differ from resonant activation (in the sense of an\noptimal noise intensity) in an overdamped system with fluctuating potential barrier [21],\nand from rectification of fluctuations in an underdamped system with periodic temper-\nature profile [22]. The work opens new possibilities for controlling the effectiveness of\nthermal ratchets. For example, it was noticed in [9] that voltage rectification by an over-\ndamped SQUID ratchet decreases very fast (exponentially fast [23]) for high frequencies.\nGiven that its equations of motion [9] are of the form (1) we suggest that the rectification\nmechanism discussed above can be applied to e.g. high-frequency voltage rectification by\na SQUID ratchet.\nWe acknowledge valuable discussions with M I Dykman, V N Smelyanskiy and R\nMannella.
