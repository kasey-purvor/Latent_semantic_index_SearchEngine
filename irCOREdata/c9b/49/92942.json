While  Leila  Quartermain's daughter Tracy is present, Lucy Coe has no mother, having been brought up by her aunt Charlene, Dr. Monica Quartermain, Felicia Jones, Honor Domain, Simone Harding and others have no  visible mothers.  Further, as Lucy's aunt supports her sons more than her niece, as Monica's mother-in-law is not particularly supportive of her, as Tracy's mother is continually critical of her, in none of these cases  is  any  positive  mother-daughter  relationship  portrayed,  in  contrast  to  the  relationships between mothers and sons.","cites":null},{"id":17340492,"title":"Intimations of postmodernity.","authors":[],"date":"1992","doi":"10.4324\/9780203414934","raw":"Bauman, Z.
