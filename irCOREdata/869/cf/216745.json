In this \nchapter, we examine trends in both period and cohort fertility throughout the twentieth \ncentury, and demonstrate some important differences across demographic and social \ngroups in the timing and quantum of fertility. Breaking with a market-oriented and \nlaissez-faire approach to work and family issues, the last 10 years have seen the \nintroduction of new social and economic policies aimed at providing greater support to \nfamilies with children. However, the effect of the changes is likely to be limited to \nfamilies on the lower end of the income scale. Rather than facilitating work and \nparenthood, some policies create incentives for a traditional gendered division of \nlabour. Fertility appears to have remained stable despite, rather than because of, \ngovernment actions.  \n                                                          \n1 The United Kingdom comprises the contiguous regions of Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland) \nalong with Northern Ireland. Its political system is relatively complex. To varying degrees, different regions \nhave different legislative powers and different regions take responsibility for collecting and disseminating \nstatistics. As a result, statistical information is sometimes collected and reported for the United Kingdom as a \nwhole (covering Northern Ireland and Great Britain), sometimes just for Great Britain, and, in an increasing \nnumber of cases, separately for England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.  This paper focuses \npredominantly on England and Wales, which account for the majority \u2013 more than 85 percent -- of the UK \npopulation. \n2 Department of Social Policy, London School of Economics and Political Science, Houghton Street, London, \nWC2A 2AE, United Kingdom.

Introduction  \nIn 2001 the total fertility rate (TFR) for England and Wales reached an historic low of \n1.63. It has, however, increased every year since and in 2006 reached 1.87 -- its highest \nlevel since 1980 (Office for National Statistics 2007a). These recent fluctuations have \nattracted a large amount of media attention, much of which belies the fact that fertility \nhas actually remained fairly stable. In the period since 1980, the average value of the \nTFR was around 1.76, falling below 1.70 and exceeding 1.83 in only six of the 27 years \n(see Figure 1 below). Moreover, the total fertility rates in England and Wales have been \nrelatively high within the European context. Recently Sobotka (2004) suggested that \nEngland and Wales might, together with the Northern European countries, France and \nIreland, form a \u201chigh fertility belt\u201d within Europe.  \nDemographically, England and Wales are well placed to deal with the challenges \nof population ageing. In each year of the twentieth century, except 1976, the population \nof the United Kingdom as a whole experienced growth from natural increase, and this \nlooks set to continue. Relatively high fertility combined with high rates of immigration \nmean that population growth is projected for several decades. The latest population \nprojections for England and Wales estimate that the 2006 population of 53.7 million \npeople will increase by nearly 10 million in the period up to 2031. Longer-term \nprojections show the populations of both England and Wales continuing to rise at least \nuntil 2056 (Bray 2008).3 Taking into account planned increases in the state pension age, \nprojections for the UK as a whole suggest that the working age population should \ncontinue to grow at least until 2031, although old age support ratios are expected to \nbegin falling from around 2020 (Bray 2008). \nAggregate measures and indicators suggest that the current demographic profile is \nrelatively benign when compared to many other European countries (Sobotka 2004). \nThe demographic situation is somewhat unexpected given the social and political \nenvironment. England and Wales have experienced many of the same social changes \nthat work to delay and, perhaps, inhibit fertility in other industrialised countries. Time \nspent in education has increased, age at first partnership has increased, and cohabiting \nfirst partnerships have become increasingly common (Ermisch and Francesconi 2000a). \nAlthough fertility within cohabiting unions has increased, fertility rates within marital \nunions remain at higher levels (Ekert-Jaffe, Joshi, Lynch, Mougin and Rendall 2002; \nKiernan 2004). Moreover, getting married and starting a family are no longer so closely \n                                                          \n3 Projections for England and Wales have been reported separately, and for small areas such as Wales \nprojections are only reported up to 2056. \nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 15 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 457 \ntimed. Together these trends have worked to increase the mean age at first birth from \naround 24 in the 1960s, to 27.6 in 2005 (see Figure 6 below).4 \nAlthough it is aware of the problems associated with low fertility and population \nageing, the Government of the United Kingdom remains reluctant to intervene directly \nto influence fertility outcomes, except to reduce rates of teenage motherhood (Gauthier \n1996; Department for Education and Skills 2006). The current UK policy on \npopulation, presented to the UN Conference on Population and Development in Cairo \nin 1994, reads:  \n \nThe United Kingdom government does not pursue a population policy in the sense \nof actively trying to influence the overall size of the population, its age-structure, or the \ncomponents of change except in the field of immigration. Nor has it expressed a view \nabout the size of population, or the age-structure, that would be desirable for the United \nKingdom. Its primary concern is for the wellbeing of the population, although it \ncontinually monitors demographic trends and developments. The current level of births \nhas not been the cause of general anxiety. The prevailing view is that decisions about \nfertility and childbearing are for people themselves to make (Office for National \nStatistics 1993). \n \nNot surprisingly, there is little that could be called pro-natalist in the UK policy \nframeworks. Compared to other Western European countries, child benefits are low, \nand the Government remains reluctant to intervene in the labour market (de Henau, \nMeulders, O\u2019Dorchai, and P\u00e9rivier 2002; Perrons and Sigle-Rushton 2006). Equal \nopportunities legislation is strong, but, until recently, there was extremely limited \nsupport for mothers\u2019 employment in the form of regulation or the provision of childcare \nservices (Gornick, Meyers and Ross 1997). Nonetheless, female labour market \nparticipation has increased since the 1970s, and employment rates of both women and \nmothers are high (Gregg, Gutierrez and Waldfogel 2003). However, the employment \nexperiences of women with and without caring responsibilities differ considerably. For \nthose in full-time employment, working hours are long relative to the EU-12 countries \n(Himmelweit and Land 2007). There is no evidence that men reduce their working \nhours when they become fathers \u2013 some studies find that fathers work longer hours on \naverage (Dermott 2006). The economic environment therefore reinforces a gendered \ndivision of paid and unpaid work because men\u2019s time is taken up with long hours of \nwork, and caring responsibilities are shifted onto the female partner. The high-intensity \nwork culture increases the costs of parenthood, and creates disincentives for \nchildbearing in dual-earner families, except perhaps amongst the most highly paid \n                                                          \n4\n Here and elsewhere, birth order refers to estimates of true birth order. \nSigle-Rushton: England and Wales: Stable fertility and pronounced social status differences \n458  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org \nwomen, who can afford to purchase substitute care (Joshi and Davies 1992; Sigle-\nRushton and Waldfogel 2007). \nDespite the lack of government intervention, fertility rates in England and Wales \nhave remained stable and high relative to much of Europe (Coleman 2006). There is, \nhowever, a good deal of diversity in timing and\/or the quantum of fertility across \ndifferent demographic and social groups. Despite a general trend of postponement, \nearly first childbearing has persisted resulting in a \u2018hump\u2019 in the fertility schedule at \nyoung ages (Chandola, Coleman and Hiorns 2002; Rendall et al. 2005). Consistently \nhigh rates of teenage pregnancy distinguish England and Wales from its Western \nEuropean counterparts, and are associated with poor outcomes for both the mothers and \ntheir children (Bynner and Parsons 1999; Social Exclusion Unit 1999; Hobcraft and \nKiernan 2001). Although researchers disagree on the extent to which early motherhood \nis the outcome of, rather than the precursor to, disadvantage (see, for example, Duncan \n2007), there is some evidence of a causal effect on some outcomes, even after \nattempting to control for selection effects (Ermisch and Pevalin 2003).5 Whether the \nassociations are causal or not, young motherhood can be viewed as an indicator of \ndisadvantage for both the mother and her children. In addition, amongst the less-\neducated and those with a weak attachment to the labour market, childbearing still often \noccurs at young ages, and completed family sizes are larger (Rendall and Tomassini \n2004). Conversely, those who obtain high levels of education tend to delay their first \nbirth. Conditional on a first birth, they are more likely to have (and move more quickly \nto) a second birth, but as Berrington (2004) points out, the effect of postponement to \nfirst birth is not offset by subsequent acceleration. The completed fertility of highly \neducated women, particularly those in managerial positions, remains low relative to \nother women, a pattern not observed in France (Ekert-Jaffe et al. 2002). Finally, the \nproportion of births to mothers born outside the United Kingdom has increased steadily \nin recent years. These figures suggest that the costs of reproduction in England and \nWales may be falling disproportionately on specific population groups, as reflected in \nits greater variation in completed family size and high concentration ratios (Coleman \n1996; Shkolnikov, Andreev, Houle and Vaupel 2007). A closer examination of fertility \npatterns in England and Wales might raise questions about whether the current \ndemographic regime is both stable and fair. \n \n                                                          \n5 Although work that tries to isolate the casual effect of becoming a mother before the age of 20 finds little \nevidence that early motherhood has negative effects on the woman\u2019s qualifications, employment or earnings \nat age 30, it does appear to decrease the likelihood of homeownership, and increase the likelihood that her \npartner, if she has one, is unemployed (Ermisch and Pevalin 2003). \nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 15 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 459 \n2. Fertility levels and trends  \n2.1 Trends in period fertility and completed family size  \nAlthough fertility began to decline in England and Wales from about 1875, fertility \nchange during transition, and in the post-transition years, was neither smooth nor \nhomogeneous. Fertility decline began earlier and fell more steeply amongst women of \nhigher social and occupational classes (Haines 1989). Fertility continued to fall during \nthe first decades of the twentieth century. By the 1930s, fertility had dropped to \nhistorically low levels, and the TFR remained below two until 1942. Assumptions that \nthe sharp downward trends in fertility would continue unabated led to implausible \nprojections, whereby, under the most optimistic assumptions, the population of England \nand Wales was projected to be around 28.5 million in 2000 (Hobcraft 1996). In the \n1940s, however, fertility began to climb again, and despite the disruption of the second \nWorld War and the subsequent period of austerity, the TFR peaked in 1947 at 2.68 \nbirths per woman. It subsequently fell to about 2.2 and remained at that level until 1955 \n(Figure 1). An even more dramatic upturn in fertility followed when, in the late 1950s \nand 1960s, the TFR began to grow, and, in 1964, reached its highest level in the \ntwentieth century \u2013 this time inspiring population projections of 65 million by the year \n2000 (Hobcraft 1996). In fact, the mid-year population in 2000 was just under 53 \nmillion (Ghee 2001). The 1960s baby boom was followed by an almost equally \ndramatic baby bust in the 1970s. Since then, the TFR rebounded slightly and has been \nrelatively stable since the early 1980s (Figure 1).   \nMeasures of completed cohort fertility are available for women born from 1920 \nonward, and are depicted in Figure 1. Completed family size follows a downward U-\nshaped pattern which, except for the earliest cohorts, tends to track period trends fairly \nclosely. For women born in 1920, completed family size was around two children per \nwoman. Fertility levels increased in each of the subsequent cohorts up until those born \nbetween 1934 and 1938. These women were at peak childbearing ages during the 1960s \nbaby boom and had around 2.4 children on average. Completed family size \nsubsequently declined, levelling off for cohorts born between 1954 and 1960 at levels \nsimilar to those of the 1920 birth cohort. Women born after 1960 appear to have \nexperienced some further decline. Those born in 1964 and 1965 have had about 1.9 \nchildren on average.  \nFluctuations in completed fertility are far less extreme than changes in period \nfertility, particularly during the 1960s baby boom years. The size of the fluctuations in \nthe TFR relative to those that have been observed for completed cohort fertility can be \nexplained, in part, by changes in the composition of the population at risk (both by age \nand parity) (N\u00ed Bhrolch\u00e1in 1987) and by shifts in the timing of births (Bongaarts and \nSigle-Rushton: England and Wales: Stable fertility and pronounced social status differences \n460  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org \nFeeney 1998). Counts of the female population by parity, first released in the 1960s, \ncan be used to construct an alternative measure of the TFR, one that takes into account \nthe structure of the population at risk by age and parity (Smallwood 2002b).6 When the \ntotal fertility rate is calculated using parity progression ratios (TPPFR7) rather than age \nspecific fertility rates, total period fertility is generally similar but fluctuations are \nnoticeably less extreme during the 1960s baby boom years (Figure 1; see also Murphy \nand Berrington 1993).  \n \nFigure 1: Period and cohort fertility indicators, England and Wales  \n \n1.5\n1.7\n1.9\n2.1\n2.3\n2.5\n2.7\n2.9\n3.1\n1948 1953 1958 1963 1968 1973 1978 1983 1988 1993 1998 2003\nYear\nCh\nild\nre\nn\n \npe\nr \nw\nom\nan\n1920 1925 1930 1935 1940 1945 1950 1955 1960 1965 1970 1975\nCohort\nTFR\nTPPFR\nCompleted Fertility\n \nSource: Smallwood (2002a); Office for National Statistics Birth Statistics FM1 Nos.13, 27\u201334, Tables 1.4 1.7, 10.2. \nNote: TPPFR is the total period parity fertility rate, an alternative measure of TFR calculated using period parity progression ratios. \nSee Smallwood (2002a). \n                                                          \n6\n Vital statistics only contain information on birth order for children who are born to married mothers, and \neven this information is complicated by the way in which information about multiple births is recorded. \nEstimates of the number of all births by \u2018true\u2019 birth order are produced by combining vital registration \ninformation with data collected by the General Household Survey (Smallwood 2002a; Office of Population, \nCensuses and Surveys 1985). \n7\n The TPPFR is calculated using information on the female population broken down by age and parity. For \ndetailed information on how it was calculated, see Smallwood (2002a), Box 3. This method is somewhat \ndifferent from that used by Murphy and Berrington (1993) which used information on birth intervals (duration \nof exposure).  \nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 15 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 461 \nThe decline in fertility after the 1960s baby boom is due in part to a steady decline \nin fertility rates, particularly at parities two and higher (Figure 2). The probability of \nprogressing to higher order births fell by around 30 percentage points. In contrast, the \nprobability of having a first or second birth fell far less dramatically. Amongst childless \nwomen, the probability of having a first birth fell steadily from just over 90 percent in \nthe 1960s, to about 80 percent in 1982. Similarly, for women of parity one, the \nprobability of a second birth fell by only 8.7 points between 1964 and 1982 (Smallwood \n2002a). The 1980s brought a break with past trends. Consistent with the postponement \nof first births, the first birth probability has continued to fall, but progression from other \nparities noticeably levelled off (Figure 2).   \n \nFigure 2: Period parity progression ratios for England and Wales, 1964\u20132000  \n \n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\n1964 1969 1974 1979 1984 1989 1994 1999\na_0 a_1 a_2 a_3 a_4+\n \nSource: Smallwood (2002a). \n \n \nAn examination of the parity distribution of different birth cohorts (Figure 3) \nindicates that, for cohorts born in the two decades before the 1940s, the proportion of \nwomen having two or more children rose (see also Frejka and Sardon 2006). The \ndecline in completed family size for cohorts born since 1938 (Figure 1) appears to have \nbeen due to two different trends. For the 1940-1950 cohorts, a decline in large families \n(following an earlier increase) was accompanied by a further increase in two-child \nSigle-Rushton: England and Wales: Stable fertility and pronounced social status differences \n462  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org \nfamilies. For more recent cohorts, rates of childlessness increased and the proportion \nhaving two children began to decrease. Proportions at all other parities remained \nrelatively stable. About 13 percent of women born in 1950 were childless at age 45, up \nfrom around 11 percent of the 1940 birth cohort). For women born 10 years later, this \nincreased to 18 percent (Figure 3). Although the shift towards a two-child family \nobserved in earlier cohorts was not entirely reversed, about half of the earlier gains \nwere negated (Office for National Statistics 2006). The predominance of the two-child \nfamily and the decline of larger families are similar to trends in other European \ncountries, but it is noteworthy that the distribution of completed fertility amongst \nwomen who have recently completely their fertility is more dispersed than in most other \ncountries with relatively high rates of both childlessness and of large families. Only \nIreland follows such a distinctively flat parity distribution (Shkolnikov et al. 2007, \nTable 5). \n \nFigure 3: Percentage distribution of women according to final  \n number of children by birth cohorts 1920-1960 \n \n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n1920 1925 1930 1935 1940 1945 1950 1955 1960\nBirth cohort\nPe\nr \nce\nn\nt\nchildless\n1 child\n2 children\n3 children\n4+ children\n \nSource: Office for National Statistics Birth Statistics FM1 No. 34, Table 10.5. \nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 15 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 463 \n2.2 The postponement of childbearing  \nSince the mid-1960s, at the height of the baby boom, the timing of fertility has changed \nconsiderably. Slightly less than two-thirds of women aged 15\u201329 were childless in \n1970. By 2000, 75 percent of women aged 15\u201329 were childless (Smallwood 2002a). \nReflecting this trend of postponement, the peak of the age specific fertility schedule has \nbeen moving to the right. Since the mid-1970s, fertility rates for women aged 30 and \nover have been increasing, and, in 2005, age-specific fertility rates between the ages of \n30 and 40 were similar to 1965 levels (Figure 4). Recently released data for 2006 \nsuggest this movement to older ages has not abated. The highest birth rate of 99.4 live \nbirths per 1,000 women was recorded for the 30\u201334 age group. Although the fertility \nrate of women aged 40+ remains low at 11.4 births per 1,000 women, it is more than \ndouble what it was in 1986 (Office for National Statistics 2007a). \n  \nFigure 4: Age-specific fertility rates in England and Wales, 1965-2005  \n \n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n15 18 21 24 27 30 33 36 39 42 45\nPe\nr \nth\no\nu\nsa\nn\nd\n1965 1970\n1975 1985\n1995 2005\n \nSource: Smallwood (2002a); Office for National Statistics Birth Statistics FM1 No. 34, Table 10.1. \n \n \nAn obvious consequence of these trends is that the mean age at childbearing has \nbeen increasing since 1974 for all births, offset to some extent by teenage fertility rates \n(Figure 5). Although age at first birth started moving upward slightly earlier (in 1971), \nSigle-Rushton: England and Wales: Stable fertility and pronounced social status differences \n464  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org \nthe age at birth at all parities has increased since 1974, but more slowly and less \ndramatically for non-marital births and births of parity four or higher (Smallwood \n2002a; Office of Population, Censuses and Surveys 1985).  \n \n \nFigure 5: Trends in the mean age of motherhood in England and Wales, \n 1938\u20132005  \n \n20\n22\n24\n26\n28\n30\n32\n1938 1943 1948 1953 1958 1963 1968 1973 1978 1983 1988 1993 1998 2003\nYe\nar\ns \nof\n \nag\ne\nall births marital births first birth\n \nSource: Office for National Statistics Birth Statistics 1837\u20131983, Historical series FM1 No. 13, and Vol. Nos. 27, 28, 29 and 33, \nTables 1.5 and 1.7a; Office of Population, Censuses and Surveys (1985). \n \n \nAlthough trends in age-specific fertility rates suggest both postponement and \nsubsequent recuperation, the shape of the fertility schedule has changed in other, more \ndistinct, ways. In the years following the mid-1960s, peaks in age-specific fertility rates \nhave fallen considerably, flattening in the early twenties and, to a lesser extent, at \nyounger ages, reflecting a far smaller decrease in rates of childbearing amongst \nteenagers in England and Wales compared to other European countries. This flattening \nmeans that peak rates tend to be lower and the fertility profile more dispersed than in \nother European countries (Chandola, Coleman and Hiorns 2002). These patterns can be \nobserved in cohort profiles as well.  For women born in the mid- to late-1950s, the age \nprofile of first births is more dispersed than in France and Norway, countries with \nsimilar levels of TFR. As a consequence, a substantially higher proportion of women \nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 15 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 465 \ngave birth at the youngest ages, and a higher proportion delayed childbearing until after \nthey turn 30 (Rendall et al. 2005).  \nThe effect of these changes becomes more apparent when the age-specific fertility \nrates for single years of age are added together to produce fertility rates for five-year \nage groups (Figure 6). The stability of the total fertility rate since the 1980s is due to a \ndecrease in fertility at ages 20 to 29, which is offset by an increase at ages 30 to 40. \nFertility at the oldest and youngest ages has remained fairly stable. Since 2000, fertility \nfor those aged 20 to 29 has levelled off. In contrast, for women in their thirties, it has \ncontinued to rise. These trends contributed to the recent rise in the TFR between 2001 \nand 2006 (Office for National Statistics 2007a). \n \n \nFigure 6: Age-specific fertility rates (per 100 women) for five-year age groups,  \n 1965\u20132005  \n \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005\n15-19\n20-24\n25-29\n30-34\n35-39\n40-45\n \nSource: Smallwood (2002a); Office for National Statistics Birth Statistics FM1 No. 34, Table 10.1 \nNote: Each point in the graph above represents data from a single calendar year.

Figure 7 plots the cumulative fertility, every five years from age 15, of successive \ncohorts of women, relative to those born in 1950 who had 2.07 children on average. \nTeenage fertility declined for the next three cohorts, with a cumulative fertility at age \n20 of 0.05 (1955 cohort), 0.12 (1960 cohort), and 0.16 (1965 cohort) fewer children. \nThis figure then stabilised for each of the subsequent cohorts at around 0.14 to 0.16 \nfewer children.  \nThe gap in fertility widened until age 25 for the cohorts born in 1955 and 1965, \nand until age 30 for each successive cohort with data at that age. Although women born \nafter 1950 never reached the same level of fertility, more than half the gap at age 30 \nwas closed by either age 40 (1955 and 1965 cohort) or age 45 (1960 cohort). Compared \nto women born in 1950, completed fertility for the 1955 and 1960 birth cohorts was \n0.05 to 0.09 fewer births per woman, respectively. Data at age 40 for the 1965 cohort \nsuggest further decline is likely unless fertility increases very steeply over the next five \nyears. However, the convergence of the curves for the 1975, 1980 and 1985 cohorts \nsuggests that patterns of postponement may be stabilising.  \n \nFigure 7: Cumulative fertility by age for birth cohorts,  \n compared with women born in 1950  \n \n-0.7\n-0.6\n-0.5\n-0.4\n-0.3\n-0.2\n-0.1\n0.0\n0.1\n15 20 25 30 35 40 45\n1950\n1955\n1960\n1965\n1970\n1975\n1980\n1985\n \nSource: Office for National Statistics Birth Statistics FM1 No. 34, Table 10.2. \nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 15 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 467 \n2.3 Differential fertility patterns  \nCompared to other European countries, fertility rates in England and Wales have \nremained stable in a context where government support for families, particularly \nworking families, has been improving but remains fairly limited. To some extent, the \nlow fertility that might be expected in this context has materialised, but as we see in this \nsection, only for some groups.  \n \n \n2.3.1 Teenage childbearing  \nFrom the 1970s, teenage fertility rates fell only slightly, while the rest of the fertility \nschedule was shifting more emphatically down and to the right as fertility was being \npostponed. This trend is reflected in the continuously high and overlapping curves at \nearly ages for the 1985, 1995 and 2005 age-specific fertility rates, characteristic of most \nEnglish-speaking countries, which have emerged over the past three decades (Chandola \net al. 2002; Figure 4). Although there is evidence for the intergenerational transmission \nof early motherhood in England and Wales (Huerta and Sigle-Rushton 2008), rates of \nteenage childbearing amongst women who were born to older mothers are high as well, \nand explain most of the cross-country differences (Rendall 2003).  \nThe Government\u2019s Social Exclusion Unit (1999) considers high teenage pregnancy \nrates to be due to low aspirations (stemming for high levels of inequality), ignorance \nabout the risks of unprotected sex, and mixed messages about the appropriateness of \nsexual behaviour. Although the official understanding of the issues surrounding early \nmotherhood, particularly the ignorance of young women, has not gone unquestioned \n(see for example van Loon 2003; Duncan 2007), data drawn from the Millennium \nCohort Study suggest that a large majority of young mothers\u201486.9 percent of those \nwho gave birth before the age of 18, and 75.9 percent of those who gave birth between \nthe ages of 19 and 21\u2014describe their pregnancy as unplanned (Joshi, Hawkes and \nWard 2004, Table 5). This suggests that there is some scope for interventions aimed at \ngiving women more control over the timing of their first conception. \nIn 1999, the Teenage Pregnancy Strategy was implemented. The Strategy set \ntargets for reducing the under-18 conception rate by 2004 (by 15 percent) and 2010 (by \nhalf), relative to their 1998 levels (Social Exclusion Unit 1999; Department for \nEducation and Skills 2006). Since the targets were set, under-18 conception rates in \nEngland have fallen year on year and, because of increases in abortion (see Section 2.4 \nbelow), under-18 birth rates have fallen even more (Teenage Pregnancy Unit 2008). \nData for Wales, where teenage conception rates tend to be higher, suggest that under-18 \nconceptions fell quickly between 1998 and 2001, and continued to decline thereafter, \nSigle-Rushton: England and Wales: Stable fertility and pronounced social status differences \n468  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org \nbut far more slowly (Statistics for Wales, 2005). Despite some success, the 2004 target \nwas not met, and if current trends continue, it is unlikely that the 2010 target will be \nmet (Wilkinson et al. 2006; see also Teenage Pregnancy Unit 2008).  \nAlthough it is likely that an initiative which successfully reduced teenage \nparenthood would simply result in the postponement of early births to later ages, and \nthat the overall impact on completed family size would be small, it is nonetheless worth \nnoting that teenage childbearing makes a notable contribution to period fertility rates \n(Figure 6). In 2005, the TFR of 1.80 would have fallen to 1.73 if contributions from \nthose under twenty were halved. All else equal, a substantial reduction in teenage \nchildbearing would have worked to reduce the TFR in the first years of the twenty-first \ncentury. \n \n \n2.3.2 Educational differentials  \nAlthough only a few studies have examined differences in fertility by women\u2019s \neducational qualifications in England and Wales, evidence suggests considerable and \nwidening differentials in the timing of fertility by education level. These differentials \nreflect both the composition of different educational groups (minority ethnic groups and \nthose from impoverished or low social class backgrounds tend to have lower levels of \neducation) and the link between education and labour market position (Hobcraft 2000; \nHobcraft and Kiernan 2001; Robson and Berthoud 2003). The age profile of first birth \nrates has shifted and flattened for both medium- and high-educated women, both over \ntime and relative to patterns observed in Norway and France. Comparing women born \nbetween 1954 and 1958 with those born between 1963 and 1967, Rendall and \ncolleagues (2005) find that, amongst those born in the 1950s, 46.2 percent of medium-\neducated and 49.1 percent high-educated women had a child between the ages of 21 and \n29.8 For those born in the 1960s, the percentage of women giving birth in their twenties \nhad fallen to 41.7 for the medium-educated, and to 37.3 for the high-educated. \nAdditionally, high-educated women in the younger cohort were far less likely to have \ngiven birth by age 33 \u2013 a fall of more than 10 percentage points (Table 1). In Norway \nand France, percentages of high-educated women giving birth by age 33 were well over \n70 percent. In contrast to the profiles of the medium- and high-educated, amongst low-\neducated women the age profile of fertility changed little across cohorts. Around 42 \npercent of low- educated women gave birth before the age of 21 in both cohorts, and \n                                                          \n8\n Age in this study is measured as age completed during the calendar year. All other data in this chapter are \nbased on age completed last birthday. \nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 15 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 469 \nmore than 80 percent gave birth before the age of 33 (Table 1). These patterns suggest \nthat trends in postponement differ substantially by education level.  \n \nTable 1: Percentage of women with a child by select ages, by cohort and  \n education level*, 1950s and 1960s cohorts \n \n Age Low education Medium education High education\n 1950s 1960s 1950s 1960s 1950s 1960s\n19 23.8 23.6 10.0 8.0 0.4 0.0\n21 41.8 42.6 20.3 17.0 1.8 0.2\n25 66.0 67.0 45.9 38.2 16.9 9.9\n29 80.3 78.0 66.5 58.7 50.9 37.5\n33 84.1 82.3 76.9 72.1 65.3 53.8\n \nSource: Rendall et al. (2005).  \nNote: * Women\u2019s education level was reported at about age 25. \n \nResearch comparing longitudinal data for Great Britain with similar data from \nGermany, the Netherlands and Sweden tells a similar story about differentials in the \ntiming of birth by level of education. In the 1990s, the mean age at first birth amongst \nBritish mothers who were high-educated was five years older than that of mothers with \nlow education \u2013 the widest gap observed across all four countries. Fertility patterns in \nthe 1950s and 1960s showed far less differentiation by educational attainment, and most \nof the subsequent divergence was due to high-educated women postponing their first \nbirth (Gustafsson, Kenjoh, and Wetzels 2002). Although there are clear patterns of \npostponement, this study does not consider the implications of postponement for \nchildlessness or completed family size. So it is not clear to what extent high-educated \nwomen recuperate postponed fertility. \nThe prevailing view amongst policymakers that work and childbearing decisions \nshould be largely determined privately appears to have created a situation where higher \nlevel work and motherhood have been increasingly difficult to combine, at least at \nyoung ages (Office for National Statistics 1993; Dixon and Margo 2006). There is, \nhowever, some evidence that postponed fertility is recuperated. Amongst those born in \nthe 1950s, higher qualified mothers had a median age at first birth that was about five \nyears older than that of women with less education, but, conditional on having had a \nfirst birth, they were more likely to go on to have a second or third birth and to do so \nmore quickly (Rendall and Smallwood 2003; Table 2). Nonetheless, more than 22.5 \npercent of high-educated women had remained childless by age 40, compared to 15.2 \npercent of women with lower qualifications. Ekert-Jaffe and colleagues (2002) report \nsimilar findings. Berrington (2004) examined a sample of women who were in their \nearly forties when they were interviewed for the 2000 and 2001 General Household \nSigle-Rushton: England and Wales: Stable fertility and pronounced social status differences \n470  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org \nSurvey (which covers all of Great Britain), and found that 28 percent of women with \nthe highest educational qualifications were childless. For those with a medium level of \neducation (\u201cintermediate qualifications\u201d), rates of childlessness were only 20 percent. \nFinally amongst those with no qualifications, only 16 percent were childless in their \nearly forties. One-child families were more common amongst women with high \nqualifications, so about half of the high-educated had a completed family size of one or \nless. Conversely, very few women with no qualifications had only one child, and about \none in five had a completed family size of four of more children. These studies \ndemonstrate differentials in not just the timing of fertility, but the quantum of fertility \nby level of education.  \n \nTable 2: Proportions of mothers having a second birth and timing  \n of second births, by age at first birth and education level,  \n 1954\u201358 cohort in England and Wales  \n \n  age 25 age 30 age35 \nPercentage having a  \na second birth  \nno higher qualifications 93.0 83.5 59.8 \nhigher qualifications 96.0 90.8 73.6 \nTiming of second births   \nWithin 2 years  \nno higher qualifications 53.4 48.9 45.6 \nhigher qualifications 60.6 56.7 51.7 \nWithin 5 years  \nno higher qualifications 92.7 91.9 93.6 \nhigher qualifications 95.2 94.7 95.2 \n \nSource: Rendall and Smallwood (2003). \n \nWhile various studies have documented changes in the timing of first births, and \nsome studies have documented educational differentials in childlessness and completed \nfamily size for specific cohorts, few have examined change over time in the relationship \nbetween education and fertility. There is little evidence concerning trends in the \nnumbers remaining childless, or on completed family size by education level. It may \nwell be that high-educated women are postponing their first birth, but accelerating \nsubsequent births, and that, consequently, their completed fertility is little changed \nrelative to historic levels. If that is the case, we cannot conclude that reproduction is \nbeing shifted towards other population groups in the long run, making concerns about \nchanges in the distribution of the costs of childbearing less worrying. Even if \ndifferentials are not changing, they clearly exist, and issues of fairness may remain \nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 15 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 471 \nsalient, especially in a context where support for families is low relative to much of the \nEU-15. On the other hand, it is possible that fertility that has been increasingly \npostponed has also been, and will continue to be, increasingly foregone. If this is the \ncase, educational differentials in fertility may have contributed to the upward trend in \nchild poverty rates in the 1980s and 1990s (for a discussion in the US context, see \nLichter 1997).  \n \n \n2.3.3 Fertility of immigrants and ethnic minority groups  \nInformation on immigration to England and Wales is limited. The main source of \ninformation on the number of international migrants is the International Passenger \nSurvey (IPS) which collects information on place of birth, citizenship and place of \norigin for a sample of individuals passing through UK ports. In addition, counts of \nforeign immigrants, broken down by citizenship only, is available from the Home \nOffice Control of Immigration Statistics. However, information on place of birth is \navailable in vital statistics (asked as a voluntary question at the registration of births and \ndeaths since 1969) and census data. Data from the 2001 census indicate that just under \nnine percent of the population of England and Wales were born outside of the United \nKingdom. Finally, the Labour Force Survey contains information on birthplace, \ncitizenship, and date of entry, but for an analysis of small groups the numbers are often \ninsufficient, and samples from several years must be combined in order to obtain \nstatistically significant results (Coleman and Smith 2005).  \nRegistration data from 1971 suggests that 11.3 percent of all births were to women \nborn outside the United Kingdom. Thirty-five years later, 21.9 per cent of births were to \nwomen born outside of the United Kingdom (Office for National Statistics 2007b). In \nthe 1980s, more than eight percent of all births were to women who were born in the \nNew Commonwealth or Pakistan. By 2003, this figure had increased to nearly 19 \npercent of all births (Coleman and Smith 2005). In particular, women born in Pakistan \nand Bangladesh, many of whom are young mothers and poorly educated as well, have \nhad consistently high levels of fertility (Robson and Berthoud 2003).   \nTable 3 sets out estimates of the total fertility rate by country of birth for several \nyears. The denominators are constructed using the estimated population by place of \nbirth using information from the last census, combined with birth and death \nregistrations and international migration estimates. With limited information on \ninternational migration, it is likely the measure is subject to greater levels of error the \nfarther away it is from the last census date (Coleman and Smith 2005). For Pakistani \nand Bangladeshi women, TFRs were above six in the early 1980s, and, despite having \nfallen somewhat during the 1990s, are still well above European levels. In 2001, the \nSigle-Rushton: England and Wales: Stable fertility and pronounced social status differences \n472  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org \nTFR for these women was more than twice the national average. In contrast, the fertility \nof women born in India and the rest of the world is far closer to the national average.  \n \nTable 3: Total fertility rate: by country of birth of mother,  \n England and Wales 1981 \u2013 2001 \n \nCountry of birth of mother 1981 1987 1991 1997 2001 \nTotal 1.8 1.8 1.8 1.7 1.6 \nUnited Kingdom1 1.7 1.8 1.8 1.7 1.6 \nTotal outside UK 2.5 2.4 2.3 2.5 2.2 \nNew Commonwealth 2.9 2.8 2.8 3.1 2.8 \nIndia 3.1 2.7 2.5 2.3 2.3 \nPakistan 4.8 5.3 4.7 \nBangladesh 6.5 5.2 5.3 4.8 3.9 \nEast Africa 2.1 1.0 1.9 1.8 1.6 \nRest of Africa2 3.4 3.2 2.7 3.5 2.0 \nRest of New Commonwealth3 2.3 2.5 1.9 2.9 2.2 \nRest of the World 2.0 1.9 1.9 2.1 1.8 \n \nSource: Office for National Statistics Birth Statistics FM1 Nos. 22, 24, 26, and 32, Table 9.5 \nNote: 1 Including Isle of Man and Channel Islands \n2 Includes countries listed under Southern Africa and Rest of Africa in Table A of birth statistics, series FM1 No.32 \n3 Includes countries listed under Far East, Mediterranean, Caribbean and Rest of New Commonwealth in Table A of birth statistics, \nseries FM1 No 32. \n \nThe contribution of foreign births to the overall TFR is small, but not trivial. \nEstimates suggest that, in England and Wales in 2001, the total fertility rate of 1.63 \nwould have fallen to 1.56 if the 17 percent of all births to mothers who had been born \noutside of the whole United Kingdom were excluded. In 2006, the TFR for the UK as a \nwhole would have fallen by 0.1 births per woman (Office for National Statistics 2007b). \nBecause of increased tempo shortly after migrating9 and data issues10, their longer-term \ncontribution to fertility is more difficult to determine. In any case, net migration is \n                                                          \n9\n As Toulemon (2006) illustrates, the TFR for migrants can overstate the number of births that migrants are \nlikely to have because migrants often have particularly high rates of fertility shortly after they have migrated, \nand lower rates before arriving. These effects will be particularly strong in a context where recent migrants \ncomprise a large share of all migrants.  \n10\n The most recent TFR of 1.87 may be biased upward because of high levels of immigration and poor quality \nimmigration data. The migrant population has increased substantially since 2000, but is not well counted. \nMothers tend to be counted and are included in the numerator of fertility rates.  However, many women who \nhave migrated but remain childless are unlikely to be precisely counted. The contribution of immigrants to the \nnumerator should be far more precise. Their contribution to the denominator is likely to be underestimated by \nhigh levels of poorly recorded migration.  \nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 15 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 473 \nestimated to have increased by 48 percent between 2003\u201304 and 2004\u201305. Although \nTFRs for UK-born women have increased, high levels of migration and a higher share \nof new immigrants as a proportion of the foreign born have contributed to the increase \nin the TFR between 2001 and 2006 (Office for National Statistics 2007b). If current \nmigration trends continue, the contribution of immigrants to period fertility indicators \nshould increase in importance. \n \n \n3. Fertility related changes in patterns of family formation  \n3.1 The decline in marriage and the rise of cohabitation  \nFor cohorts born in the first half of the twentieth century, marriage occurred early and \nwas nearly universal. Amongst those born between 1931 and 1951, more than half of \nmen and three-quarters of women were married before the age of 25 (Table 4). By age \n50, 11.1 percent of men born in 1951 had never married. For women the figure was \neven lower. Data for younger cohorts show that marriage was increasingly both \npostponed and foregone (Murphy and Wang 1999; Bynner et al. 2002; Office for \nNational Statistics 2006). For those cohorts born in 1965, fewer than 30 percent of men \nand just under half of women were married by age 25. By age 40, over 29 percent of \nmen and 21 percent of women had never married \u2013 a substantial increase in non-\nmarriage relative to previous birth cohorts. Turning to the most recent cohorts, young \nmarriage has become even more uncommon. In recent years, mean age at first marriage \nhas increased to over 29 for women, and to 31 for men (Office for National Statistics \n2006).  \nThe postponement of marriage is linked to a more prolonged and, in some ways, \nmore difficult transition from adolescence to adulthood. Over the second half of the \ntwentieth century, fewer men and women were leaving school with no qualifications, \nand numbers enrolled in higher education have grown. This has worked to increase the \nnumber of years spent in education during late adolescence \u2013 a stage in the life course \nwhen many earlier cohorts were entering marriage. Comparing men and women born in \n1958 and 1970, Bynner and Parsons (2001) find that fewer members of the 1970 cohort \nwere unqualified, and more had gone on to obtain higher qualifications. As time spent \nin education was being prolonged, the labour market was changing rapidly. By 1986, \nthe youth labour market had deteriorated in many parts of the UK, and those leaving \nschool were often unemployed or only able to obtain casual employment. There were \nfewer apprenticeships, although some enrolled in youth training programmes (Bynner et \nal. 2002). Finally, those born in 1970 were entering adulthood at a time when housing \ncosts were prohibitively high. To make matters worse, the policy of selling off local \nSigle-Rushton: England and Wales: Stable fertility and pronounced social status differences \n474  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org \nauthority housing, which had a large effect from the mid-1980s, meant that there was a \nlimited stock of public accommodation available. Moreover, the available stock was \n\u201cconcentrated in the least salubrious areas and among the most economically and \nsocially disadvantaged groups\u201d (Smith and Ferri 2003: 206). Those making the \ntransition to adulthood in the late 1980s and at the turn of the century faced similar \nproblems with the costs of housing. These conditions, along with less job security and \nincreasing rates of youth unemployment (discussed in more detail in Section 5 below), \nmade leaving the parental home particularly difficult. Data for the UK as a whole \nindicate that more than 37 percent of men and 18 percent of women aged 20\u201324 in 1994 \nwere still living with their parents (Aassve, Billari, Mazzuco and Ongaro 2002).  \n \n \nTable 4:  Proportions of men and women ever married at select ages,  \n by birth cohort 1931\u20131985  \n \n Age in years \nMen 20 25 30 40 50\n1931 2.8 52.3 80.9 90.1 91.8\n1941 6.3 60.5 83.0 90.8 92.1\n1951 9.8 58.5 78.0 87.2 88.9\n1961 5.7 38.2 61.5 76.4\n1965 3.1 28.9 52.7 70.6\n1975 0.9 11.1 31.1\n1980 0.7 8.5\n1985 0.5\n \nWomen 20 25 30 40 50\n1931 18.7 75.0 88.9 93.6 94.7\n1941 28.0 80.4 90.7 94.9 95.7\n1951 30.6 77.4 88.1 92.7 93.6\n1961 20.2 57.7 74.3 83.5\n1965 12.3 47.3 66.5 78.3\n1975 3.9 22.1 44.1\n1980 2.8 17.3\n1985 2.1     \n \nSource: Office for National Statistics, Marriage Divorce and Adoption Statistics, Series FM2, No. 32 Table 3.36. \n \nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 15 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 475 \nWith changes in the transition to adulthood came changes in the nature of first \npartnership. Specifically, cohabitation replaced direct marriage for a large percentage of \nyoung adults (Kiernan 1999). Up until the late 1970s, the prevalence of cohabiting \nunions was low and the majority of those cohabiting were divorced and separated. Since \nthat time cohabitation has become far more common, and the characteristics of women \nand men who choose to cohabit has changed. Between 1976 and 1998, the proportion of \nunmarried women who were cohabiting in Great Britain increased more than threefold, \nfrom nine percent to 29 percent, and the percentage of cohabiting women who were \nnever married increased sharply (Haskey 2001). For the cohort born between 1950 and \n1962, data drawn from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) show that those \nfrom high social class backgrounds were more likely to cohabit. For the 1963\u201376 \ncohort, cohabitation was more normative, and the association is not significant \n(Ermisch and Francesconi 2000b). Using the same data source, another analysis reports \nthat, for those born between 1963 and 1967, premarital cohabitation as a first \npartnership was most common amongst women with degree level qualifications \n(Kiernan 1999, Table 8). Amongst those who had a first partnership by 1992, only 27 \npercent of the most highly educated women married directly, whilst over 40 percent of \nwomen with lower qualifications reported having done so. Educational differentials \nhave subsequently disappeared. Ermisch (2005) suggests these changes are due to a \ndiffusion of more tolerant attitudes about consensual unions spreading from the more \nprivileged innovators to the wider society. The increasing popularity of unmarried \ncohabiting unions and their changing character mean that the time spent outside of a \npartnership in young adulthood has grown, but far less than figures on the \npostponement of marriage would suggest (Ermisch and Francesconi 2000a). \nAbout half of all cohabitating unions formed by women born in 1970 were \nsubsequently dissolved, and rates of dissolution are higher for those with low levels of \neducation (Ermisch 2005). Nonetheless, in analyses that compared cohorts born in 1958 \nand 1970, Steele and colleagues (2006) find that having children is associated with \nrelatively greater stability in the younger cohort, and the authors suggest that the \ndistinction between married and cohabiting partnerships with children may be less \nimportant now than it was in the past.  \n \n \n3.2 A weakening of the link between marriage and childbearing  \nIn the last three to four decades, the nature of the relationship between marriage and \nfirst childbearing has changed. In the 1970s, a small (but increasing, especially after \n1977) proportion of births occurred outside of marriage (Figure 8), and first marital \nbirths tended to occur very shortly after marriage. In more recent years, longer intervals \nSigle-Rushton: England and Wales: Stable fertility and pronounced social status differences \n476  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org \nbetween marriage and first birth have become increasingly common. In 1970, 59 \npercent of all marital first births were to women who had been married one year or less, \nand nine percent were to women who had been married for five years or more. By 2005, \n16 percent of first marital births were to women who had been married five years or \nmore. Moreover, 48 percent of marital first births took place in the first two years \u2013 an \n11 point decline since 1970 (Table 5).   \n \nFigure 8: Annual number of marriages and births, England and Wales,  \n 1938\u20132004  \n \n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n700\n800\n900\n1,000\n1938 1943 1948 1953 1958 1963 1968 1973 1978 1983 1988 1993 1998 2003\nTh\nou\nsa\nn\nds\nMarriages\nAll births\nMarital births\nNon-marital births\n \n \nSource: Office for National Statistics Birth Statistics 1837\u20131983 (Historical series FM1 No 13); FM1 Volume No's 18 and 28 to 33, \nTables 1.5 and 2.1.  \n \n \nOver the same period, it became less likely that marriage would precede \nchildbearing. The percentage of births taking place outside of marriage \u2013 many but not \nall of which are first births to never married women \u2013 increased from around nine \npercent in 1975, to 43 percent in 2004 (Figure 8). Part of this increase was apparently \ndue to a decline in the propensity of women to marry shortly after becoming pregnant. \nThat one in four first marital births in 1970 were to women who had been married seven \nmonths or less suggests that it was not uncommon for a woman\u2019s pregnancy to instigate \nmarriage (Table 5). By 2005, only nine percent of first marital births occurred so \nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 15 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 477 \nquickly after marriage. Data on first marriages tell a similar story about changes to the \nrelative timing of marriage and childbirth. In the 1960s, around one in five first \nmarriages were followed by a birth in the next eight months. By 2003, this had \ndecreased to 9.5 percent, although levels and rates of change vary considerably by age \nat marriage (Table 6). \n \n \nTable 5: First marital births by duration of the marriage,  \n all married women 1970\u20132005  \n \n    Percentage of first marital births by duration of marriage \n Completed months Completed years \n \nAll \ndurations(N) 0\u20137 8\u201311 0 1 2 3 4 5 6+\n1970 277,407 0.25 0.11 0.36 0.23 0.15 0.10 0.06 0.03 0.06\n1975 226,944 0.17 0.08 0.25 0.20 0.17 0.14 0.09 0.06 0.09\n1980 240,975 0.16 0.08 0.24 0.20 0.15 0.12 0.09 0.07 0.13\n1985 212,017 0.16 0.08 0.24 0.22 0.16 0.11 0.08 0.06 0.13\n1990 200,394 0.14 0.09 0.23 0.23 0.16 0.12 0.08 0.06 0.13\n1995 168,118 0.10 0.09 0.20 0.24 0.17 0.12 0.08 0.06 0.13\n2000 146,509 0.10 0.10 0.20 0.26 0.17 0.11 0.08 0.05 0.13\n2005 155,953 0.09 0.11  0.20 0.28 0.18 0.11 0.07 0.05 0.11\n \nSource: Office for National Statistics Birth Statistics 1837\u20131983 (Historical series FM1 No 13); FM1 Volume No's 18 and 28 to 34, \nTable 5.1.  \n \n \nThe rise of unmarried cohabitation has led to an increasing proportion of births \ntaking place within unions, but outside of marriage (Steele, Joshi, Kallis and Goldstein \n2006). Although non-marital births have increased substantially, simulations suggest \nthat only about one-fifth of the increase can be attributed to changes in non-marital \nfertility rates. Most of the increase appears to be due to growth in the population at risk \nof a non-marital birth \u2013 many of whom are in cohabiting unions \u2013 and not to increases \nin the non-marital fertility rates, which remain low compared to marital fertility rates \n(Ermisch 1999).

Comparing cohorts of women \nborn between 1950 and 1952 with women born from 1962\u20131976, Ermisch and \nFrancesconi (2000b) found that the median age of motherhood increased over a year \nfrom 26.4 to 27.5.  \n \nSigle-Rushton: England and Wales: Stable fertility and pronounced social status differences \n478  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org \nTable 6: The percentage of first marriages where a birth occurs  \n within eight months, by age of mother at marriage  \n \n  Age at Marriage \n  \nUnder 45 Under 20 Age 20\u201324 Age 25\u201329 Age 30\u201344 \n1955 14.8 24.3 13.4 10.4 8.1 \n1960 18.6 33.8 13.6 12.3 9.1 \n1965 22.3 38.3 15.6 13.5 10.2 \n1970 20.0 35.4 13.6 11.8 9.9 \n1975 13.0 23.8 8.1 7.4 7.4 \n1980 14.0 25.5 9.8 9.6 10.7 \n1985 13.4 26.8 10.9 10.4 11.0 \n1990 11.5 24.0 10.4 9.5 11.7 \n1995 10.1 20.6 10.3 8.3 10.8 \n2000 9.3 19.9 10.9 7.5 8.8 \n2003 9.5 20.1 11.2 7.8 9.0 \n \nSource: Office for National Statistics Birth Statistics 1837\u20131983 (Historical series FM1 No 13) Table 1.7; FM1 Volume No's 18 and 28 \nto 33, Table 1.8.  \n \n \n3.3 Divorce and union dissolution  \nSecular divorce was first created in 1857. The Matrimonial Causes Act (1937) \npermitted fault-based divorce on the grounds of adultery, cruelty and desertion of at \nleast three years. There are no reliable statistics on divorce prior to 1950, but it was not \nuntil the availability of legal aid in 1950 that divorce became affordable for a significant \nportion of the British population. The Divorce Reform Act of 1969 introduced divorce \nby mutual consent with a separation period of at least two years. This was followed \nshortly after by the Matrimonial Causes Act in 1973, according to which a divorce can \nbe granted if the petitioner has been married for at least one year, and the marriage has \n\u201cbroken down irretrievably\u201d. Irretrievable breakdown is evidenced when one of the \nfollowing five facts is established as \u201cproof\u201d: adultery of the other spouse, unreasonable \nbehaviour of the other spouse, desertion after two years, separation with mutual consent \nafter two years, or separation with no consent after five years (Smart 1999). In about 70 \npercent of cases in England and Wales, the divorce petitioner cites adultery or \nunreasonable behaviour in the petition for divorce (Office for National Statistics 2007c) \nIn 1995, the government mooted the idea of divorce law reform, and published \nLooking to the Future: Mediation and the Ground for Divorce (Lord Chancellor\u2019s \nDepartment 1995). The Family Law Act of 1996 soon followed. The Act would have \nled to the adoption of no-fault divorce. The Bill was passed but only partly \nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 15 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 479 \nimplemented. Since then, divorce reform in England and Wales has been in a state of \nlimbo. The law continues to be fault based and, for the most part, based on the \nMatrimonial Causes Act (Smart 1999). \nAlthough there had been short-lived increases in previous decades, the divorce rate \ndid not begin its consistent and steep upward trend until the early 1960s (Smith 1997). \nThe total divorce rate11 increased from 0.1 to 0.4 between 1960 and 1980. It \nsubsequently stabilised after 1995, at around 0.45. While not the highest in Europe, this \nrate places England and Wales on the high end of EU countries (Eurostat 2004; Council \nof Europe 2005).  \nThe net effect of divorce on fertility is difficult to predict. High divorce rates \ncombined with the high rates of dissolution amongst cohabitating couples should work \nto dampen fertility, but fertility intentions may be revised upward with repartnering to \ntake into account the preferences of the new partner, or because of the desire of newly \nformed couples to have at least one shared child (Vikat, Thomson and Hoem 1999). \nThis may have countervailing effects. Data from the early 1990s suggest that 45 percent \nof British women who experienced a divorce gave birth within twelve years of having \ndissolved their marriages. Interestingly, the woman\u2019s parity at the time of dissolution \nwas not strongly associated with subsequent childbearing. This finding suggests that the \ndecision-making process of previously divorced women differs from that of women \nwho are still in their first marriage, where parity is likely to be a key consideration \n(Jefferies, Berrington and Diamond 2000). \n \n \n3.4 Changes in sexual behaviour, contraceptive use and induced abortion  \nThe 1960s and 1970s saw unprecedented change in both sexual behaviour and the \ncontrol of reproduction. Delayed marriage was not met with similar delays in sexual \ndebut. Data from the Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles Survey indicate that nearly one in \nfive British women born between 1926 and 1930 had experienced their first sexual \nintercourse by the age of 20. For this birth cohort, the median age at first intercourse \nwas 23 \u2013 about the median age at first marriage. For the cohort born in the second half \nof the 1950s, the median age had fallen to 19, an age at which fewer than 20 percent \nwere married (Botting and Dunnell 2000). Those born in between these two cohorts \nengaged in more pre-marital sexual activity at young ages than those born earlier, but \ndid not benefit from good access to contraception. The result was a large number of \n\u2018shotgun marriages\u2019 in the post-war period, as evidenced by the peak in premarital \n                                                          \n11\n The total divorce rate is a period measure calculated by summing divorce rates by duration of marriage for \na given year. \nSigle-Rushton: England and Wales: Stable fertility and pronounced social status differences \n480  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org \nconceptions in the 1960s, especially for those under 20, which fell subsequently to \n1950s levels by the second half of the 1970s (Hobcraft 1996). These patterns also \nsuggest that contraception and abortion were widely used once they became legally \navailable. \nWomen reaching adulthood in the 1970s had unprecedented access to reliable \ncontraceptive methods and legal abortion. The contraceptive pill was made available for \npurchase in January of 1961. At first, contraceptive services were only available to \nmarried women and for medical reasons, and their extension to women who were \nunmarried took place over many years. However, by 1974, the contraceptive pill was \nprovided by the National Health Service to all women free of charge (Hobcraft 1996).   \nWomen first gained legal access to abortion in 1968 (legalised by a new Act of \nParliament in 1967). For the first five years, services were limited and rates of use were \nlow (Table 7). As services became more widespread between 1969 and 1974, rates of \nuse more than doubled. Currently, a woman can obtain an abortion in the first 24 weeks \nof pregnancy (lowered in 1990 from 28 weeks in the original Act), as long as two \ndoctors conclude that a woman\u2019s physical or mental health or her child(ren)\u2019s physical \nor mental health will be under greater threat if she continues with the pregnancy than if \nshe terminates it. In cases where two doctors decide a woman\u2019s health is gravely \nthreatened if she carries the pregnancy to term, or that the foetus is likely to suffer from \nsevere physical or mental abnormalities, there is no legal time limit. In practice, most \nabortions take place well within the time limit. In 2006, 89 percent of abortions were \ncarried out within 13 weeks of conception (Department of Health 2007). \n \nTable 7: Frequency of induced abortion in England and Wales, 1969-2005 \n \nYear \nNumber of \nAbortions\nAbortions per\n100 conceptions*\nAll Ages Crude \nAbortion Rate(15\u201344)\nStandardised\nAbortion Rate\n1969 54,819 5.9 5.3 5.2\n1974 162,940 14.6 11.5 11.2\n1979 149,746 15.9 12.0 11.5\n1984 169,993 17.6 12.8 12.2\n1989 183,974 19.9 15.5 15.1\n1994 166,876 19.1 14.6 14.6\n1999 183,250 21.8 16.2 16.8\n2004 194,498 22.5 16.9 17.8\n2005 194,353 n.a. 17.0 17.8\n2006 201,173 n.a. 17.5 18.3\n \n*Not ending in miscarriage \nSource: Department of Health (2007). \nhttp:\/\/www.johnstonsarchive.net\/policy\/abortion\/ab-ukenglandwales.html. \nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 15 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 481 \nIn 1995, the proportion of conceptions leading to an abortion was, at 19, well \nabove the level observed in many other Western European countries, and similar to \nthose found in Scandinavian countries. At the same time, it was lower than in other \nEnglish speaking countries where it was legal (Henshaw, Singh and Haas 1999). \nHowever, in 1996, the rate of conceptions and the rate of abortion both increased, \nparticularly amongst women aged 20\u201324. Researchers have linked the sudden increase \nto a warning issued by the Committee on Safety of Medicines in October 1995 about a \nlink between seven brands of contraceptive pill and thrombosis (Wood, Botting and \nDunnell 1997). Despite increasing use of emergency contraception (Botting and \nDunnell 2003), abortion rates have continued to increase and, in 2004, 22.5 percent of \nconceptions leading to either an abortion or a live birth ended in legal abortion. This \ntrend has not been well examined or well explained in the extant research. Although \nsome have suggested that subsequent pill scares are to blame (Summerfield and Babb \n2003), there is little evidence that use of contraceptive pills has declined appreciably, \neven at the time of the 1995 scare (Wood et al. 1997; Taylor, Keyse and Bryant 2006). \nWith the exception of legal abortion, there is little good information on the use of \ncontraceptive services prior to the Family Formation Survey (FFS) of 1976. At that \ntime, the contraceptive pill was the most commonly used method, and about 28 percent \nof women aged 14\u201349 were using it (Botting and Dunnell 2000). In 2005, about 24 \npercent of women used the contraceptive pill, representing just under one-third of \nwomen using any method (Table 8).   \nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, surgical sterilisation became common in England and \nWales, and has remained at high levels since that time (Botting and Dunnell 2000). In \nline with historic trends, similar proportions of male and female sterilisations were \nreported in 2005, when nearly 40 percent of women aged 40 and over reported that \neither they or their partners had been sterilised as a means of contraception. The use of \nsterilisation for women in their thirties has declined somewhat over time (Taylor et al. \n2006). This is most probably due to trends in the postponement of fertility.  \nExcept for condoms, the use of which has increased over time (often used in \naddition to other methods), the proportions using other types of methods have remained \nfairly low and stable since the 1970s. Condom use began climbing in the early 1990s, \nmost probably due to concerns about HIV-AIDS. Data collected in 1997 suggest that \ndisease prevention was a motivating factor for 54 percent of men and 62 percent of \nwomen who reported having used a condom in the previous 12 months (Botting and \nDunnell 2000).   \nHigh and stable rates of fertility in England and Wales are not due to low levels of \ncontraceptive use, except perhaps for specific groups of younger people (Social \nExclusion Unit 1999). Modern methods of contraception \u2013 the contraceptive pill in \nSigle-Rushton: England and Wales: Stable fertility and pronounced social status differences \n482  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org \nparticular \u2013 have, at least since the mid-1970s, been used at high levels in young \nadulthood, after which sterilization becomes increasingly common. \n \n \nTable 8: Contraceptive methods used in 2005\/06,  \n percentages by age group  \n \nAge 16\u201317 18\u201319 20\u201324 25\u201329 30\u201334 35\u201339 40\u201344 45\u201349 All\nPercentage using any modern method 51 67 82 74 78 78 70 75 74\nCurrent method(s) used (those using at least one method)        \nNon-surgical methods          \nPill 61 60 63 47 43 23 15 6 32\nMale condom 78 50 43 34 32 26 16 14 28\nIUD 0 2 0 6 6 8 9 12 7\nInjection\/implant 12 21 13 9 6 4 2 1 6\nPeriodic abstinence 0 0 0 3 3 2 2 0 2\nWithdrawal 6 0 4 7 5 4 6 4 5\nOther non-surgical 16 6 3 3 8 4 3 7 6\nSurgical methods    \nSterilized 0 0 1 2 9 18 17 29 13\nPartner Sterilized 0 0 1 4 5 15 34 29 15\nPercentage not using any method 49 33 18 26 22 22 30 25 26\nReason for not using a method (those not using any method)       \nNo heterosexual relations 96 100 87 65 40 45 42 42 55\nSterile after another operation 0 0 0 5 1 11 23 15 10\nWants to get pregnant 0 0 0 17 30 21 7 4 12\nCurrently pregnant 4 0 8 6 16 4 1 0 5\nPossibly infertile (post-menopausal or other) 0 0 4 4 6 7 15 35 12\nDoesn't like contraception 0 0 0 0 2 4 3 0 2\nOther reason 0 0 2 3 3 9 8 5 5\nN 55 39 154 161 214 270 261 224 1377\n \nSource: Taylor, Keyse and Bryant (2006).  \n \n \n4. Social and population policies  \nAlthough there has been little policy that aims directly to influence fertility, it is likely \nthat changes to social and economic policies in recent years have had indirect effects by \naltering the costs of childbearing. Prior to 1997, family policy was minimal, reflecting \nthe liberal, individualistic and market oriented ideology of the United Kingdom. Taxes \ntended to be individualized (although there was some tax relief in the past for married \ncouples), and, for married couples, issues of fertility and child care were considered \nprivate matters (O\u2019Donoghue and Sutherland 1999; Randall 1999). In contrast, the \nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 15 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 483 \nUnited Kingdom was unique (along with the Netherlands) in that it expected lone \nmothers to remain at home and care for their children full-time, and provided low levels \nof income support that enabled them to do so (Millar 1996). But changes in recent years \nhave reflected a marked move towards greater governmental support of families with \nchildren, especially when those families are engaged in (low) paid work. Some of the \nmore important aspects of recent policy reforms and developments include \nimprovements to maternity and parental leave entitlements, including a right for parents \nwith small children to request part-time hours (Lewis and Campbell 2007); increases in \nchild benefit12 (counterbalanced for some families by the removal of the lone parent \nsupplement); changes to the tax system that increase incentives for people to take up \npaid work (Brewer and Shephard 2004); and improved public provision of child care \n(Brewer, Crawford and Dearden 2005). Although these changes took place fairly \nrecently, we can nonetheless speculate about the likely impact. \n \n \n4.1 The employment rights of parents  \nStatutory maternity leave has existed since the 1970s, but it was originally only \navailable to women who had been continuously employed with the same employer for \nat least two years (five years for women working short part-time hours). A substantial \nproportion of working women failed to meet this requirement (McRae 1991). \nEntitlement was only extended to all working mothers in the early 1990s, at which time \na two-tiered system of Ordinary Maternity Leave (OML) and Additional Maternity \nLeave (AML) was put in place (Gregg et al. 2003). Until recently, all women \nemployees were entitled to 26 weeks of OML, and those who had completed 26 weeks \ncontinuous employment with their present employer were eligible for a further 26 \nweeks of AML. For babies due on or after 1 April 2007, job protected maternity leave \nwas extended to one year for all women, regardless of length of service. At the same \ntime, entitlement to Statutory Maternity Pay was extended to 39 weeks. Currently, the \nfirst six weeks are paid at 90 percent of earnings, and the remaining 33 weeks are paid \nat a flat rate of \u00a3117.18 per week. The flat rate is more than double what it was in \n1997.13 From 2010, paid maternity leave will be extended to one year.14 \n                                                          \n12\n http:\/\/www.ifs.org.uk\/ff\/childben.xls. \n13\n http:\/\/www.direct.gov.uk\/en\/Employment\/Employees\/WorkAndFamilies\/DG_10029285. \n14 http:\/\/www.hmrc.gov.uk\/statutory-notices\/paternity-leave-pay.htm. The goal is to extend entitlements by \nthe end of this Parliament, but the time of introduction has not been confirmed.  \nSigle-Rushton: England and Wales: Stable fertility and pronounced social status differences \n484  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org \nParental leave, an unpaid, individual entitlement consisting of 13 weeks per parent, \nper child, was first introduced in December 1999.15 In contrast to maternity leave, \nwhich has been increasing in length and the generosity of payment, parental leave \nlegislation complies with the minimum required by the EU Directive on Parental Leave, \nand goes little beyond it (Lewis and Campbell 2007). Leave can be taken in blocks or \nmultiples of one week up until the child is aged five, but parents are not permitted to \ntake more than four weeks of leave per calendar year. All employees with at least one \nyear of continuous employment with their present employer, and who have, or expect to \nhave, parental responsibility for a child are eligible.16 Consistent with its reluctance to \nimpose strong regulations on the labour market or to interfere in \u2018private matters\u2019, the \nGovernment\u2019s Summary Guidance states that \u2018wherever possible employers and \nemployees should make their own agreements about how parental leave will work in a \nparticular workplace.\u2019(Department of Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform n.d.). \nMoreover, if employers \u2018cannot cope\u2019 they are permitted to postpone a period of leave \nfor up to six months (Department of Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform n.d.).  \nAlthough rights to stay at home to care for a young child have been extended in \nrecent years, the focus has been on providing longer and better paid maternity leaves. \nRights for fathers to take leave have been far more limited, although since 2003 they \nhave had the statutory right to two weeks paid paternity leave. In 2010, when paid \nmaternity leave increases to one year, mothers will be able to transfer the last six \nmonths of their leave entitlement to fathers, who would be compensated at the flat rate. \nNot surprisingly, the Government expects take-up to be low. This policy approach, \nwhich is unique in Europe, reinforces the traditional gendered division of paid and \nunpaid work (Lewis and Campbell 2007).  \nTo facilitate the work-life balance of working parents, legislation was also \nintroduced in 2003 that gives parents of children under the age of six (under 18 if the \nchild is disabled) a right to request flexible work in existing jobs. From April 2007, this \nright to request was extended to those with caring responsibilities for adults as well \n(Himmelweit and Land 2007). This measure could serve to reduce some of the \noccupational segregation between full-time and part-time jobs. Research suggests that, \nthus far, the majority of requests for flexibility have been granted, although mothers are \nfar more likely to make requests, and fathers are more than twice as likely to have their \nrequests turned down (Palmer 2004; Holt and Grainger 2005; Lewis and Campbell \n2007). Other national evidence suggests the practice is limited, and only those who \nthink their requests will be granted place a request in the first place (Manning and \nPetrongolo 2004). Likewise, local labour market studies suggest that flexible working \n                                                          \n15\n http:\/\/www.berr.gov.uk\/employment\/workandfamilies\/parental-leave\/index.html. \n16\n http:\/\/www.direct.gov.uk\/en\/Parents\/Moneyandworkentitlements\/Parentalleaveandpay\/DG_10029416. \nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 15 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 485 \narrangements are not widespread. Some firms have extended this right to all employees \n(Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development 2005), but, as the scheme remains \ndiscretionary, the decisions that firms make are likely to vary with the state of the \nlabour market. Furthermore, qualitative studies have reported that, in practice, the \noperation of flexibility on a day-to-day basis rests on decisions made by line managers, \nirrespective of formal company policy (Perrons 1999, Yeandle, Wigfield, Crompton \nand Dennett 2002, Standing 2006). \n \n \n4.2 Support for the care of children  \nThis section discusses recent policy changes, all explicitly aimed at providing better \nsupport to families with children. These include expanded provision of government \nsubsidised childcare, as well as increased redistribution through cash transfers and \nchanges to the tax system.  \nIn May 1998, the Government broke with a traditional reliance on the market to \nprovide efficient levels of high quality child care and launched a National Childcare \nStrategy. The strategy aimed \u201cto ensure good quality, affordable childcare for children \naged 0 to 14 in every neighbourhood, including both formal childcare and support for \ninformal arrangements.\u201d17 Although it has been criticised for providing too few places \nto children under three (Rake 2001), there has been a substantial increase in the number \nof new childcare places made available since 1997.18 In addition, there has been an \nexpansion in free early education for three- and four-year-olds. Currently, all four-year-\nolds are guaranteed a free early education place if their parents want one, but the hours \nare part-time, and the minimum provision amounts to just 12.5 hours a week (Rake \n2001). Even with minimum hours set to increase19 to 15 by 2010, for many dual-earning \nfamilies, taking up free early childcare means they must rely on a complex mix of \nformal, informal and back-up support both for care and transportation between care \nsites. Logistical requirements of this sort prevent some mothers from taking up paid \nwork (Skinner 2003).  \nIn addition to measures aimed at facilitating work and motherhood, the \ngovernment has also increased the cash support that it offers to parents, particularly \nthose on low incomes. Child benefit is a universal cash payment made available to all \nchildren under the age of 16 and, from April 2006, to families with children aged 16, \n17, 18 and 19 who meet education or training requirements.20 The payment is made \n                                                          \n17\n http:\/\/www.surestart.gov.uk\/aboutsurestart\/about\/thesurestartprogramme2\/challenge\/. \n18\n Ibid. \n19\n Ibid. \n20\n http:\/\/www.hmrc.gov.uk\/manuals\/ccmmanual\/CCM18025.htm. \nSigle-Rushton: England and Wales: Stable fertility and pronounced social status differences \n486  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org \ndirectly to the main care provider, usually the mother. As of April 2008, the benefit \namounts to \u00a318.80 per week for the eldest child, and \u00a312.55 per week for each \nadditional child.21 Compared to other EU-15 countries, the level of child benefit is not \ngenerous. Despite above inflation increases in recent years, a fairly recent comparative \nanalysis placed the UK in the lower middle of the ranking for different amounts of \nhousehold incomes, just above the four Southern European countries (de Henau et al. \n2002).  \nIn the late 1990s, the Government introduced a series of targeted tax reforms \naimed at providing additional support to families with children. Key policies include an \nintegrated refundable tax credit for out-of-work families and low-paid working families \n(with a supplement in the first year of a child\u2019s life), and additional benefits for parents \nworking 16 hours or more per week (the Working Tax Credit) (Brewer and Shephard \n2004). The effect of these policies has been to make the tax system increasingly less \nindividualised, to increase the incomes of poor families with children, and to increase \nthe number of households eligible for benefits (Sutherland 2005). More than three times \nas many working age adults were receiving tax credits in 2004\/05 as were receiving \nwhat was then called the Family Credit in the early 1990s.22 While changes to the tax \nsystem have improved the financial situation of many families, there are concerns about \nthe impact of these changes on gender equality. Because eligibility for tax credits is \ncalculated at the household level, the system may tend to discourage second earners, \nusually the mother, from entering the labour market and accumulating work experience. \nHence, tax credits may serve to reinforce the male breadwinning model, and force some \nwomen to make difficult choices about combining work and family (Brewer and \nShephard 2004). \nTaken together, recent changes in both social policy and the labour market should \nprovide limited help to women who want to combine work and childbearing. They \nshould also work to lessen the economic costs of children. But, because the measures, \nunlike those in many other countries, tend to redistribute resources vertically rather than \nhorizontally, any effects on fertility should disproportionately affect women on lower \nincomes.23 Because of a strong reliance on means testing and flat rate benefits, \nmoderate- to high-earning women lose a higher proportion of their salary by taking 52 \nweeks of maternity leave (thirteen weeks of which is unpaid and all but nine at a flat \nrate). They might be better able to afford the loss of earnings associated with maternity \nleave, but they still face the possibility of occupational downgrading due to weak \n                                                          \n21\n http:\/\/www.ifs.org.uk\/ff\/childben.xls. \n22\n http:\/\/www.poverty.org.uk\/summary\/key%20facts.shtml. \n23\n Horizontal redistribution takes place within income groups. It is also sometimes used to refer to \nredistribution over the life cycle. An example would be Bismarkian-type social insurance policies that tend to \nbe status-preserving. In contrast, vertical redistribution is from the rich to the poor (Bonoli 1997). \nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 15 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 487 \nregulations about the right to return (those taking more than six months are only \npromised the right to return to a similar job) (Lewis and Campbell 2007) and may still \nface long-term part-time pay penalties if they request and are granted part-time hours \n(Francesconi and Gosling 2004). In that sense, the financial costs for those who are \nbetter off could be far greater. Increased economic support for children in general \nshould improve the economic circumstances of families with children, but, again, the \neffect on higher-income families (and those families who do want to adhere to a \ntraditional gendered division of labour) should be relatively small.  \n \n \n5. Social and political changes affecting fertility  \n5.1 The labour market  \nThe labour market in the United Kingdom is characterised by high activity and \nemployment rates for both men and women, and, even taking into account recent \nchanges in family policy discussed above, low levels of labour market regulation \nrelative to the rest of Europe (Perrons and Sigle-Rushton 2005; Himmelweit and Land \n2007). Participation rates in England and Wales exceed the Lisbon targets for female \nemployment (Perrons and Sigle-Rushton 2005). Unemployment rates have halved from \n10 percent in the early 1990s, to five percent between 2001 and 2005 (Figure 9), and \nlong-term unemployment has fallen by more than 80 percent since 1997. The \nproportion of children living in workless households has also fallen by 2.6 percent since \n1997 (Sutherland 2005).  \nHead count rates of employment for women and men are high, although these \nfigures mask a good deal of heterogeneity. Chronic unemployment remains a problem \nfor some individuals, and figures from 2004 show that two-fifths of the long-term \nunemployed who enter work find themselves out of work again within six months.24 \nThe activity rates of women have been rising over time, but both levels and rates of \ngrowth differ substantially by the age of the youngest child and by the presence of a \npartner (Figure 10), as well as by ethnic group (Sigle-Rushton and Perrons 2006). \nMothers with small children have far lower participation and employment rates than \nother women, and this is particularly the case for women living outside of a partnership. \nFor example, the employment rate of lone mothers in the United Kingdom was just over \n55 percent in 2004, up from 44 percent in 1996 (Sutherland 2005). Only the \nNetherlands has such a small percentage of lone mothers reporting employment or self-\n                                                          \n24\n http:\/\/www.poverty.org.uk\/summary\/key%20facts.shtml. \nSigle-Rushton: England and Wales: Stable fertility and pronounced social status differences \n488  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org \nemployment. This percentage is also small relative to the general population of women \nage 25\u201349, of whom 72 percent report their main activity status as employed or self-\nemployed (Eurostat 2004). \nDespite their increased presence in the labour market, mothers continue to \nreconcile work and family by engaging in part-time work, and often only after children \nhave entered school. Relative to other European countries, part-time jobs are more \noccupationally and vertically segregated. For example, in 2003\u201304, nearly one-quarter \nof women part-time workers in Great Britain were shop assistants, care assistants or \ncleaners (versus 7.7 percent of full-time workers). In contrast, only four percent of part-\ntime (versus 15 percent of full-time) working women were managers or senior officials \n(Manning and Petrongolo 2004). Although the gender pay gap for full-time workers is \nnot extremely wide, part-time workers face a good deal of occupational segregation, \nand an extremely large part-time pay penalty. As a consequence, many women (and \nsome men) trade flexible hours for low-paid and low-skill jobs. Of the 5.5 million \nworking age adults who earned less than \u00a36.50 per hour in 2004, nearly two-thirds were \nwomen and half were part-time workers.25 Moreover, there is concern that this has \nresulted in an inefficient utilization of skills, because a high percentage of part-time \nworkers report working below their potential (Darton and Hurrell 2005; Equal \nOpportunities Commission 2005). Hence, relative to other countries, the gap in earnings \nbetween mothers and childless women, sometimes termed the \u201cmotherhood gap\u201d, is \nhigh, and does not narrow appreciably as children get older (Sigle-Rushton and \nWaldfogel 2007). \nEqual opportunity legislation is fairly strong, but the substantive effects for those \nwhose work patterns deviate from the standard male model are somewhat limited. The \nPart-Time (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations, which aim to secure \nparity between part-time and full-time workers in terms of holiday entitlements, sick \npay and pensions, were introduced in 2000. Their potential to reduce the part-time pay \ngap is weakened by the degree of occupational and job segregation between full-time \nand part-time workers, which makes it difficult to find comparable workers in order to \nmake a case for unfair or discriminatory treatment (Perrons and Sigle-Rushton 2006). \nAs long as the labour market remains highly segregated, women\u2019s access to well-paying \njobs will be limited, unless they are willing and able to work full-time.  \n \n                                                          \n25 http:\/\/www.poverty.org.uk\/summary\/key_facts.htm Low pay is also strongly associated with qualification \nlevels. \nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 15 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 489 \nFigure 9: Unemployment rates of working aged women and men, by age group  \n \n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n20\n1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005\nWomen\nPe\nrc\nen\nt\nall ages age 15-24 age 25-49 age 50+\n \n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n20\n1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005\nMen\nPe\nrc\ne\nn\nt\nall ages age 15-24 age 25-49 age 50+\n \n \n Source: Quarterly Labour Force Survey, author\u2019s calculations. \n Note: The sample includes women aged 15 to 59 and men aged 15\u201364 to reflect statutory retirement age, which differs by sex. \n \nSigle-Rushton: England and Wales: Stable fertility and pronounced social status differences \n490  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org \nIn order to address high rates of relative poverty and child poverty, the \nGovernment has, in recent years, implemented a wide range of new policy measures, \nsome of which should address gender inequalities in the labour market. As Sutherland \n(2005) suggests, the approach can best be summarised as an attempt to reduce poverty \nwithout creating incentives for inactivity. Some of the more important measures include \nthe introduction of a national minimum wage, and the introduction of the New Deal \nemployment activation programmes. The latter, however, have tended to focus \nresources on groups of unemployed in which men are overrepresented (Rake 2001). \nOverall, the Government has increased the amount of support offered to the low paid \n(with a stronger emphasis on families with children), but it has been more radical in its \nreforms to the income tax system, and more cautious in its efforts to impose additional \nregulations on the labour market.  \nThe first legislation for a national minimum wage was passed in 1998. It took \neffect in April 1999, and has worked to raise the wages of the lowest paid, the majority \nof whom were women and part-time workers. Concerns about the costs it would impose \non businesses and the effect it might have on unemployment rates meant that the main \nrate was originally set at a fairly low \u00a33.60 per hour (with a lower youth rate of \u00a33.00 \nper hour) (Low Pay Commission 2000). However, it has been raised in each subsequent \nyear, and, as of October 2007, stands at \u00a35.52 per hour (with a lower development rate \nfor 18\u201321 year olds of \u00a34.60 per hour, and an even lower rate for 16\u201317 year olds of \n\u00a33.40 per hour).26 Set nationally, it remains well below a \u2018living wage\u2019 in more \nexpensive areas like London (Greater London Authority 2005). Despite the lower youth \nrate, which is meant to encourage employers to hire the youngest workers, \nunemployment rates for those aged 15 to 24 remain high, particularly for males (Figure \n9). Inactivity rates remain high for young people as well (Bynner and Parsons 1999; \nRennison, Maguire, Middleton and Ashworth 2005). \n \n \n5.2 The gender division of unpaid work  \nAs discussed above, the economic and policy context creates incentives for a \nspecialised gender division of paid and unpaid work, especially for families with \nchildren. What about actual behaviour? Data from the UK Time Use Survey show that, \nalthough total time spent on paid and unpaid work is similar for women and men, \nfathers report spending twice as much time in paid employment during the week, and \nmothers spend nearly twice as much time on unpaid work and caring. Mothers are \nresponsible for 75 percent of the time spent on childcare during the week, and around \n                                                          \n26 http:\/\/www.hmrc.gov.uk\/nmw\/#b. \nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 15 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 491 \ntwo-thirds of the time spent on weekends.

The two-child norm appears to be strongly entrenched, and \na lowest low fertility future, whereby the TFR falls below 1.3 children per women \n(Kohler, Billari and Ortega 2002), is not in line with stated intentions (Smallwood and \nJefferies 2003). Of course, the relationship between intentions and actual behaviour is \nextremely complex. It is likely that intentions will change \u2013 upwards and downwards \u2013 \nover time (McDonald 2002). In addition, unexpected fertility is not uncommon. \nAlthough more than two in five recent parents reported that their pregnancies were \nunplanned (Joshi et al. 2004), suggesting that a good many births were not intended or \nwere poorly timed, fertility intentions tend to consistently exceed actual future fertility. \nThis is especially true for childless women (Berrington 2004).  \nData in Table 9 show that, although nearly one in five of the oldest women in the \nmost recent wave of data are childless, only about 15 percent intended to remain \nchildless. Birth statistics from England and Wales show similar proportions of \nchildlessness for women aged 36\u201338 in 1998, 2000 and 2001 (Office for National \nStatistics 2006). Data from recent years suggest that only one to two percent of women \nwho were childless at that time managed to have a child. In other words, about one-\nquarter of childless women in their mid- to late-thirties still thought they would have a \nfirst birth, but only about 10 percent managed to do so by 2005. A gap between \nintentions and outcomes can also be observed when we consider women aged 21\u201323 in \n1979\u20131981 (birth cohort 1956\u201360), who reported that they intended to have about 2.23 \nchildren on average (Smallwood and Jefferies 2003). Those women would be aged 45\u2013\n49 in 2005, and with nearly completed fertility. The completed family size for this \ncohort ranges from 1.98 (the 1959 and 1960 cohort) to 2.02 (1956 cohort), suggesting \nthat fertility intentions exceeded actual fertility by about 10 percent (Office for National \nStatistics 2006).  \n \nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 15 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 493 \nTable 9: Intended parity distribution and mean number of children \n in England and Wales using cross-sectional data collected  \n between 1979 and 2001, women between the ages of 18 and 38  \n \nIntended partity for \nrespondents stating their \nintentions (percentages) \n0 1 2 3 4+Year(s) of data  \ncollection  age\n     \nNo intention\nStated\n(percent)\nMean number \nOf children \nintended\nCompleted \nfertility, of \nthose with an \nintention N\n1979\u201381 \n \n18\u201320 5 3 59 20 13 20 2.35 0.18 1586\n \n21\u201323 5 6 59 21 9 18 2.23 0.59 1612\n \n24\u201326 6 8 59 18 7 21 2.12 1.07 1609\n \n27\u201329 7 11 55 19 8 19 2.12 1.55 1638\n \n30\u201332 7 11 52 21 10 19 2.19 1.96 1848\n \n33\u201335 7 13 49 21 10 11 2.19 2.12 1849\n \n36\u201338 8 12 42 24 14 9 2.32 2.29 1552\n1988\u201390 \n \n18\u201320 5 7 58 20 10 7 2.25 0.19 1259\n \n21\u201323 5 8 57 21 9 6 2.23 0.48 1348\n \n24\u201326 5 10 55 22 8 7 2.19 0.82 1505\n \n27\u201329 6 11 51 23 8 5 2.20 1.33 1475\n \n30\u201332 9 13 47 22 10 6 2.14 1.65 1390\n \n33\u201335 10 12 45 22 11 6 2.13 1.83 1350\n \n36\u201338 10 13 46 21 11 4 2.14 2.03 1305\n1998, 2000\u20132001 \n \n18\u201320 9 12 54 18 7 4 2.05 0.23 761\n \n21\u201323 7 10 57 17 9 3 2.14 0.42 744\n \n24\u201326 10 11 55 18 5 3 1.99 0.69 874\n \n27\u201329 8 14 52 18 7 2 2.04 1.07 1081\n \n30\u201332 10 14 50 19 7 3 2.01 1.35 1211\n \n33\u201335 13 13 46 19 9 1 2.01 1.65 1343\n  \n36\u201338 15 17 40 19 9 1 1.93 1.80 1279\n \nSource: Smallwood and Jefferies (2003). \nNote: The higher proportion of women not stating an intention in the 1979\u201381 period is because uncertain respondents were not \nfurther probed as they were in later waves. \n \n \nSigle-Rushton: England and Wales: Stable fertility and pronounced social status differences \n494  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org \n5.4 Family support  \nThe rapid social and demographic changes that have taken place in England and Wales \nshould have important implications for family support networks. Increased longevity \nand lower fertility have worked to reduce the size of each generation, while at the same \ntime increasing the number of generations alive at any one time (Bengtson, Rosenthal \nand Burton 1990). Indeed, Dench, Ogg and Thompson (1999) showed that three-\nquarters of British respondents were part of a three-, four- or even five-generation \nfamily group. This suggests more potential for support across generations than within \nthem. \nUsing a somewhat dated (1988\/89) sample of British adults aged 55\u201375, Grundy \n(2005) shows that at least two-thirds of parents reported having regular or frequent \nintergenerational exchange between themselves and their children. Parents were more \nlikely to report providing than receiving support, with childcare and domestic help \nbeing the most commonly reported forms of assistance. That a high percentage of \nparents reported providing help with childcare is not surprising given that childcare at \nthat time was often expensive and in short supply. These findings suggest that regular \nor frequent intergenerational support, the most common of which requires contact, is \nrelatively common, even if co-residence is not (Pampel 1992; Grundy 2000). Despite \nthe increasing geographical dispersal of family members, working parents \u2013 for a \ncombination of reasons related to preferences and cost constraints \u2013 rely to a great \nextent on informal childcare provided by grandparents (Woodland, Miller and Tipping \n2002). Hence, for many working parents, private solutions have been found to allow \nthem to combine work and childbearing. Attempts to increase the employment rates of \nolder people, if successful, may remove this option for some families, increasing the \ncosts of childbearing.  \n \n \n6. Conclusion  \nDespite recent demographic and social changes, and despite limited levels of support \nfor families with children, fertility in England and Wales has remained high and stable \nrelative to much of Europe. Like its European neighbours, England and Wales has seen \nan increasing percentage of young people continuing their education beyond the \ncompulsory level; a more protracted transition to adulthood; an increase in female \nlabour market participation; the postponement of marriage and fertility; and the wide \nacceptance of contraceptive methods, including abortion. In contrast to most other \ncountries in the \u201chigh fertility belt\u201d (Sobotka 2004), the government has been reluctant \nto implement policies to encourage childbearing, and many of its policies aimed at \nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 15 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 495 \nsupporting families with children reinforce a traditional gendered division of labour. In \nthis context, women may find it difficult to combine (full-time, well-paid) work and \nchildbearing. Put simply, fertility appears to have remained stable despite, rather than \nbecause of, government actions. \nDo the findings in this chapter suggest that policy can do little to influence \nfertility, and that generous support for families as we see in other European countries \nwith similar levels of fertility is unnecessary? Given that the challenges of population \nageing appear to be benign relative to lowest-low fertility countries like Italy (Dixon \nand Margo 2006), perhaps policies to support fertility now and in the future are not \nneeded. A closer look at the timing and the quantum of the fertility of sub-groups \nsuggests that the answer, at least in the longer term, might be no. In recent years, \nfertility has remained high relative to much of Europe, in part because specific sub-\ngroups of the population have high rates of fertility (e.g. certain ethnic groups, \nimmigrants), or have not changed their fertility behaviour (e.g. the low-educated). The \nfertility of teenagers and women with low levels of education have helped to keep \nperiod total fertility rates stable in recent years. The low-educated, in particular, are \nmore likely to have children and to have larger families. The social polarization of \nfertility by education level and occupational class \u2013 which, despite similar levels of \nfertility, is stronger than in France (Ekert-Jaffe et al. 2002) - suggests that better-\neducated and more economically secure women are having either small families or no \nfamilies, while those with fewer outside opportunities and less economic stability are \naccounting for the shortfall. Increased financial support in recent years may have \noffered the latter some compensation for the costs of reproduction. But the laissez-faire \napproach to fertility issues in general, and to labour market interventions in particular, \nmay well have made the combination of work and motherhood too difficult for other \ngroups women.  \nCurrent Government strategies include cutting rates of teenage parenthood (Social \nExclusion Unit 1999), increasing and widening participation in higher education \n(Department for Education and Skills 2003), reducing occupational segregation by \nencouraging women to move into traditionally male occupations (Trade and Industry \nCommittee 2005), increasing the education and skill levels of the immigration stream,28 \nand addressing poor employment opportunities at the lower end of the socio-economic \nscale.29 If the Government meets these goals, but does so without paying more attention \nto the economic costs and consequences of childbearing for all families, the result may \nwell be a less benign, lower fertility future.  \n                                                          \n28 \n\u201cImmigration points system begins\u201d http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/uk_politics\/7269790.stm.  \n29 \n\u201cSkills drive 'to boost workforce'\u201d http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/education\/7097125.stm.  \nSigle-Rushton: England and Wales: Stable fertility and pronounced social status differences \n496  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org \nReferences  \nAassve, A., F.
