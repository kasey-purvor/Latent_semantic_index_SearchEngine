INTRODUCTION\nHollywood actors who participate in the Oscar ceremonies re-\nceive free gifts\u2014called swag\u2014worth more than $100,000. Not just\nsuperstars get treated so well: affluent Ford and Audi customers\nreceive special service, Silicon Valley experts receive high-tech\nequipment for free, ski instructors receive winter clothing and\nski-wear at substantially reduced prices, and amateur triathletes\nget their running equipment subsidized by manufacturers. Why\nare these groups treated better than other consumers of the same\nproduct? We argue that there are informational spillovers that\nyield returns to consumers with superior information.\n* Earlier versions of this paper circulated under the titles \u201cWhy Do the Rich\nGet More Than They Pay for?\u201d and \u201cWhy Are the Wealthy Treated So Well?\u201d\nThe paper benefited from many discussions with George Mailath.

In their \u201cVIP program\u201d to market the\nThunderbird, Ford targeted affluent consumers seriously inter-\nested in automobiles. Eighty-four percent of these \u201cknowledge-\nable car buffs\u201d acted as sources of information to other buyers.1\nConvincing this lead group affects sales far beyond their own\npurchases.\nIn the case of swag for actors, clearly media visibility is impor-\ntant. Nevertheless, it is revealing that many of the free products\nfall into classes about which actors arguably know more than al-\nmost anyone else: cosmetics, clothing and accessories, and vouch-\ners for travel and hotel resorts.2 Even if the products are free,\nactors will not use them unless they meet presumably high qual-\nity standards. Using a swag product consequently sends a positive\nsignal about it to the larger market. Most products relate to an\narea of their expertise and the informational value is important.\nSimilarly, ski instructors receive large discounts on skiing equip-\nment precisely because of their role as \u201copinion leaders\u201d based\non their presumed superior information and experience in this\nmarket (German Ski Instructor Association 2006).\nHeterogeneous consumers will typically have different\npropensities to acquire information. We derive these differences\nendogenously and provide an analysis of the interplay between\n1. information accumulation by consumers;\n2. the way consumers learn from the consumption choices of\nothers; and\n3. the firms\u2019 decisions to provide discriminatory service (or\nrebates) to select consumers.\nWe model consumers who are initially uninformed about\nfirms\u2019 qualities but learn a firm\u2019s quality after purchasing. Some\nindividuals consume more frequently than others and hence are\nlikely to be better informed. When uninformed consumers can\nidentify frequent purchasers, they will optimally emulate them.3\n1.

The idea that quality might only be verified through purchases and sub-\nsequent consumption goes back at least to Nelson\u2019s (1970) concept of experience\ngoods. He suggests that the pattern of an individual\u2019s repeated purchases might\nnot be random but might incorporate the information of others, a process he terms\nguided sampling. We formalize the idea that guided sampling might evolve en-\ndogenously with firms strategically engaged in the process.\nSTRATEGIC FIRMS AND CONSUMER EMULATION 623\nBecause of the follow-on business of these frequent purchasers,\nfirms will reward them with better service than they might other-\nwise receive. Indeed, the cost of service may make the transaction\nwith a frequent purchaser unprofitable on its own. Sales to these\nmore frequent purchasers are essentially loss-leaders.\nIn our model consumers are heterogeneous with respect to\nincome, which we assume to be observable. The good of unknown\nquality is normal, so the relatively wealthy consume more fre-\nquently and acquire informationmore quickly. Consumers observe\nthe choices of some other customers in the market, which is poten-\ntially informative. Individuals who have not found a high-quality\nseller have an incentive to buy from the same firms as the cus-\ntomers they observe, in the hope that those customers have iden-\ntified a high-quality seller; at worst, the observed customers are\nstill searching randomly and following them is the same as ran-\ndomly searching on one\u2019s own. When there is a choice about whom\nto follow it pays to follow consumers who have most likely iden-\ntified a high-quality seller; those consumers will be rich because\nthe rich acquire information more quickly than the poor.\nWe focus on differences in income as the source of hetero-\ngeneity between consumers for several reasons. First, there is\nevidence that higher-income individuals tend to be opinion lead-\ners (see, e.g., Assael [1984] and Robertson, Zielinski, and Ward\n[1984]). Second, even if income or wealth might be difficult to ob-\nserve and may need to be inferred from secondary characteristics\n(dress, car model, brand of watch, etc.), this might still be easier\nthan to observe other agents\u2019 tastes. What is crucial is that sellers\nand other consumers can observe something about those buyers\nwho have more information.4\nDifferences in preferences can lead some people to consume\nmore often and, consequently, to acquire more information in the\nmarket than others. To the extent that differences in preferences\nare observable\u2014as in the example of ski instructors\u2014there is a\nrole for providing service based on preferences rather than on\nincome. We will treat this case as well: Preference differences\naffect consumption frequency analogously to income differences;\nconsequently our results provide insights in both cases. In general,\nconsumer heterogeneity that leads to one group consuming more\nfrequently results in differentially informed consumers, and the\n4. In the Discussion we outline how conspicuous consumption may arise when\nwealth must be inferred rather than being directly observed.\n624 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS\nuninformed will mimic the choices of frequent consumers.5 The\nresult is that those known to have better information will be given\npreferential treatment.\nWe abstract from three important aspects for the sake of sim-\nplicity: the importance of being famous, the role of conspicuous\nconsumption, and conflicting interests between consumer groups.\nExtending our analysis to the case in which some people are more\neasily observed than others would yield a market value to being\npopular. Conspicuous consumption becomes relevant in environ-\nments in which an agent\u2019s type cannot easily be distinguished.\nIn this case more affluent agents would like to distinguish them-\nselves from the others in order to reap the benefits of their status\nin other transactions. Finally, although in our model agents agree\nin their evaluation of the product, one could extend it to a world\nwith different opinions. People may have different views about\nwhat constitutes an attractive ambience for a restaurant, while\nall agents agree about the quality of the food. If leaders consume\noften enough, they will search for high levels on both dimensions.\nFollowers do not consume so frequently and might simply follow\nthe leaders, ending up in places in which they dislike the second\ndimension. Firms will choose the provision of the second dimen-\nsion to attract the leaders and their tastes determine the style of\nthe ambience even if they constitute a small part of a firm\u2019s busi-\nness. In this way our model captures Becker and Murphy\u2019s (2000)\nidea of the \u201ctyrannical power\u201d that social forces have over individ-\nual behavior. In our extended setup the leaders dictate the second\nproduct dimension, and in this sense constitute a dictatorship of\nthe informed.6\nIn the following section we provide support for the assump-\ntions that underlie our model. We present the model and its equi-\nlibrium implications in Section III. Section IV discusses specific\nfeatures of the model and relates it to the literature. We conclude\nby comparing our results to alternative explanations of emulation\nbased on the followers\u2019 desire simply to mimic the leaders in order\nto achieve higher social status. Our model has testable differences\nin predictions. For example, it is consistent with leadership of fe-\nmale rather than male consumers (Feick and Price 1987) and can\n5. Mimicking behavior may be moderated when there are substantial taste\ndifferences between frequent consumers and less frequent consumers about qual-\nity. A stereo aficionado may be willing to pay more for esoteric equipment than an\naverage music enthusiast.\n6. We thank the editor for bringing this point to our attention.\nSTRATEGIC FIRMS AND CONSUMER EMULATION 625\naccount for cases in which the poorer or lower classes are opinion\nleaders if the good in consideration is an inferior good. Omitted\nproofs and derivations are provided in the Appendix.\nII. EMULATING CONSUMERS\nOur model entails three key features. (1) Consumers infer\nquality from the choices of other consumers. (2) Some consumers\nhold or acquire more information than others and therefore make\nmore informed choices. (3) Firms provide these lead consumers\nwith preferential treatment or price reductions to foster indirect\nadvertising of their product. We discuss these in turn.\nPsychology and marketing have long understood that con-\nsumers infer product quality from the actions of others. Venkate-\nsan (1966) provides a classical experiment in this vein. Male sub-\njects are presented with three dress suits and are instructed to\nchoose the highest-quality suit. In the base treatment they choose\non their own, whereas in the control treatment they choose in the\npresence of others who are instructed to all agree that the second\nsuit is the best. In the control treatment subjects are significantly\nmore likely to choose the second suit than in the base treatment.\nReplications of the study and follow-ups with other products con-\nfirm these findings.7 Although social pressure to conform\u2014rather\nthan informational inference\u2014is sometimes cited as another ex-\nplanation, the results are replicated in a setting where the indi-\nvidual decides without being observed by others (Burnkrant and\nCousineau 1975). Information transmission between buyers has\nalso been explored in economic settings: Foster and Rosenzweig\n(1995) show the importance of information transmission for prod-\nuct adoption of farmers, and Mobius and Niehaus (2005) conduct\na randomized experiment in a consumer product market and find\nsignificant effects of social learning about product and service\ncharacteristics.\nThe informational influence consumers have on others\ndepends on their knowledge of the subject. When a trait that\ncorrelates with knowledge is observable, people follow the knowl-\nedgeable. Commercial marketers regularly use the association\nwith knowledgeable people in advertising strategies, often\nfeaturing amateur or professional athletes endorsing sports\nequipment. More striking are campaigns based on stereotypes.\n7. See for example Sims (1971) and Cohen and Golden (1972).\n626 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS\nDaimler-Chrysler\u2019s recent advertising campaign heavily uses an\nannouncer with a German accent in stressing the engineering of\nChryslers.8 Supposedly Germans know about cars. Similarly, the\nFrench brand LU uses an American accent in French television\ncommercials to promote their chocolate chip cookies (Martin\n2002).\nWhile marketers use stereotypes in advertising, the impact of\ninformational sources on consumer behavior depends on the cred-\nibility of the source of the information. Actual consumer choices\nare particularly credible.9 Consistent with our model, firms ex-\ntend special efforts to sell to opinion leaders. Ford\u2019s VIP campaign\ndescribed in the introduction falls into this category. Similarly,\nAdidas sponsors local soccer players through rebates on soccer\nshoes, local tennis amateurs receive free rackets from suppliers,\nand Reebok sponsors 40 \u201clocal heroes\u201d\u2014runners and triathletes\nand several regional running clubs\u2014through equipment support\n(McDonald and Milne 1999). These effects are obviously magni-\nfied when the visibility of the athletes is increased in the pro-\nfessional sports. The encouragement of special consumer classes\nto consume one\u2019s products for advertising reasons is not limited\nto sports. Some young people are considered more knowledgeable\nabout fashion, and some department stores and clothing retailers\ngive substantial discounts to young people whom they identify as\nopinion leaders (Engel, Blackwell, and Miniard 1995).\nThe case of product placements to celebrities is particularly\nstriking. As mentioned in the Introduction, the free product pack-\nage given at the Oscars has a market value of $100,000. Interest-\ningly, many products in the gift basket are products about which\nstars are likely to be knowledgeable: cosmetics, travel vouchers,\nhotel accommodations.10 Other free gifts include the provision of\ndresses, loaned jewelry, and similar products.11 The value of the\nswag is such that the IRS has begun requiring the declaration\n8.

This is most obvious for outfitters such as Burberry or Wolsey that take\nspecial pride in their sales to their most influential customer: the British royal\ncourt. Providers to the royal court commit to highest quality and service provision,\nwhich can earn them a Royal Warrant, an institutionalized way of informing the\nmarket. A Royal Warrant is only granted after at least five years of satisfactory\nconsumption experience by amember of the royal family, ensuring that quality and\nservice indeed meet court standards, and conveys a signal of quality. According to\nthe Royal Warrant Holders Association (2006), the warrants are highly prized and\nare viewed as a mark of excellence and quality in the general marketplace.\n10.

Consumers\nhave constant per-period income, which is nonstorable, and are\nheterogeneous with respect to this income. Each consumer i \u2208 I\nhas a type \u03b8i \u2208 {p, w}, indicating whether he is poor or wealthy.\nThe proportion of wealthy consumers is \u03b1 \u2208 (0,1), and each of\nthem has income yw. Poor consumers have income yp < yw.\nFirms are infinitely lived and heterogenous with respect to\nthe quality q \u2208 {ql,qh}, ql < qh, of the otherwise identical indivis-\nible good they produce. We denote the proportion of firms with\nquality qh by \u03bb \u2208 (0,1).\nConsumers\u2019 types are observable. A firm\u2019s type is initially\nknown only to the firm and is fully revealed to a consumer after\nconsumption of the firm\u2019s output. Consumers die each period with\nprobability (1 \u2212 \u03b4); when a consumer dies, a new consumer of the\nsame type is born; new agents know only the proportion of high-\nquality firms.\nIII.A. The Firm\u2019s Problem\nEach firm j \u2208 J supplies an indivisible good, the quality of\nwhich is exogenous and unchanging over time. Themarket price of\nthe good, P > 0, is exogenously given and identical for all firms.15\nOur focus is on firms\u2019 efforts to attract customers, and for simplic-\nity we assume that the good can be produced costlessly. The firm\nchooses whether to provide service to a given customer; we denote\nthe level of service by s \u2208 {0, s\u00af}, s\u00af > 0, where 0 denotes no service.\nAt the time of service provision, the customer is already locked in\nand cannot switch to a competitor in the current period. The cost\nc(s\u00af) of providing service is c > P and is incurred in the period in\n15. Taking prices as exogenously given allows us to focus on private informa-\ntion that is not fully revealed through prices. That prices do not reveal all relevant\ninformation about products is widely accepted, and strong restrictions on pricing\nbehavior are therefore common in models of this sort to preclude revelation of too\nmuch information (see, for example, Wolinsky [1990]). We discuss the possibility\nof price competition and argue that the price could be endogenized without quali-\ntatively affecting our results under some out of equilibrium beliefs in Section IV.\nSTRATEGIC FIRMS AND CONSUMER EMULATION 629\nwhich the service is provided. There is no cost to the firm if service\nis not provided: c(0) = 0.\nFirms can commit to any current customer to give service\nthe next time he returns.16 More specifically, we model firm j\u2019s\nchoice stj,i in period t for consumer i as representing the firm\u2019s\none-period-ahead service commitment. stj,i is the promise to pro-\nvide this service level in the first period \u03c4 > t when the customer\nreturns. We assume that first-period service is zero because it is\nthe promise of future service that affects consumers\u2019 behavior. Let\nItj be the set of consumers who purchase from firm j in period t,\nand s\u02c6tj,i the service that firm j actually provides to consumer i in\nperiod t. Firm j\u2019s per period profit is\n\u03c0 tj =\n\u222b\ni\u2208Itj\nP \u2212 c(s\u02c6tj,i)di.\nFirmsmaximize the discounted present value of per-period profits,\u2211\u221e\nt=0 \u03b2\ntE\u03c0 tj .\nThe cost of the provision of service is shown in the per-period\nprofit expression above, whereas the benefits are indirect. A firm\nthat promises service to an individual consumer may deter the\nconsumer from switching to a competitor or may hasten his re-\nturn. Furthermore, the consumer\u2019s choice may affect the future\nchoices of other consumers. These (potential) benefits to a firm\nthat provides service are reflected in the size of the set of con-\nsumers who consume at the firm in the future. As a tie-breaking\nrule we assume that firms offer service when indifferent.\nIII.B. The Consumer\u2019s Problem\nConsumers are heterogeneous with respect to income, but all\ncan afford the product: yw > yp > P, where yw and yp are, respec-\ntively, the wealth of the rich and the poor. In each period t \u2208 T ,\nconsumer i \u2208 I has two choices: to enter the market or not, and\nif entering the market, from which firm to consume. If he does\nnot enter, he spends his income on a numeraire good. Income is\nnonstorable and the price of the numeraire is normalized to one;\nthat is, a consumer with income y obtains y units of the numeraire\nin the case where he does not consume in the market, and y\u2212 P\nunits if he does.\n16. We allow one-period-ahead commitment in order to eliminate implausible\nequilibria. Without commitment there is always an equilibrium in which a firm\ndoes not provide service because the firm cannot convince the customer that he\nwill also get service in the future.\n630 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS\nAt the beginning of each period, before the consumption deci-\nsion is made, a taste shock \u03c1 is realized for each consumer that af-\nfects the degree to which he enjoys consuming the indivisible good\nin that period.We assume that shocks are independent draws from\ndistribution F with density f and full support on [\u03c1, \u03c1\u00af], where\n\u2212\u221e \u2264 \u03c1 < \u03c1\u00af \u2264 \u221e. If the consumer decides to enter the market\nand consume from firm j in period t, his utility in that period is\nUt = qj + s\u02c6tj + \u03c1t + u(y\u2212 P),\nwhere qj is the quality of firm j, s\u02c6tj is the service that he receives,\nand \u03c1t is the current-period taste shock. u(\u00b7) denotes the utility\nderived from the numeraire, which is assumed to be increasing\nand strictly concave.\nIf the consumer is uninformed and chooses a firm randomly,\nhis expected utility is\nEUt = Ej[qj] + \u03c1t + u(y\u2212 P).\nIf the consumer decides not to consume, his utility for that period\nisUt = u(y). Consumers maximize the expected discounted utility\u2211\u221e\nt=0 \u03b4\ntEUt, where \u03b4 \u2208 (0,1) is the probability of survival.\nWe assume that observing other consumers\u2019 behavior par-\ntially substitutes for an individual\u2019s initial lack of information\nabout product qualities. After the first time a consumer purchases\nthe indivisible good, he can costlessly observe at which firm a ran-\ndom wealthy consumer and a random poor consumer consumed\nin the previous period.17,18 Thus, only players who participated\nin the market in the previous period are observable. For ease of\nexposition we assume that if a consumer is indifferent between\nfollowing other participants\u2019 choices observed at different periods,\nhe follows the most recent observation.\nThe combination of the numeraire good as an alternative to\nmarket consumption and the taste shock capture the idea that\n17. If all consumers observe other participants\u2019 choices and mimic those\nchoices, no one will be searching randomly and eventually only high-quality firms\nwill be frequented. Assuming that newborn consumers only observe another con-\nsumer\u2019s choice after they consume once ensures that there will always be a positive\nproportion of consumers who search randomly. One could replace this assumption\nwith an assumption that in each period a positive proportion of consumers do\nnot observe another consumer\u2019s choice, and hence must choose randomly. Our\nassumption leads to simpler computations.\n18. Observing more than one player of any type does not alter any results.\nObserving only a random selection of N players\u2019 choices, each period would not\nalter any qualitative results as long as N is sufficiently large.\nSTRATEGIC FIRMS AND CONSUMER EMULATION 631\nthe good is a normal good. The opportunity cost of going into the\nmarket is\nu0 := u(y) \u2212 u(y\u2212 P),\nthat is, the utility of foregone consumption of the numeraire good.\nDenote this opportunity cost as uw0 for the wealthy and u\np\n0 for the\npoor. The strict concavity of u(\u00b7) then implies that uw0 < up0 . That is,\nthe wealthy have a lower opportunity cost of entering the market\nbecause they get less additional utility by spending the money\notherwise.19 Without service the wealthy will therefore enter the\nmarket for lower values of the taste shock than the poor. Thus, on\naverage the wealthy consume more often, which establishes our\nversion of the normal goods assumption.20\nThe taste shock also allows firms to encourage the customer\nto consume more frequently. The timing of when to consume in\nthe market is not exogenously fixed, but rather depends on the\ncurrent-period taste shock and the utility of consumption. By\npromising service, the firms can raise the utility of consumption\nand can thus encourage a consumer to consume more frequently.\nOur focus is on the case where c > P, which is the interesting\ncase in which no consumer will receive service only because of\nhis own consumption. Firms will only provide service because a\nconsumer brings in additional customers who follow his lead. This\ncase clearly highlights the effects of information transmission in\nthe market.\nIII.C. Stationary Equilibrium\nWe are interested in equilibria in which firms and consumers\nbase their decisions only on information that is relevant for their\nfuture payoffs. We restrict attention to strategies that depend\non the type (i.e., wealthy or poor) but not on the name of other\nplayers. For firms, the minimal payoff relevant information is the\ntype of the consumer, and we consider equilibrium strategies s(\u03b8 )\nin which the service commitment of a firm is a function of the\n19. Players get in each period y\u2212 P units of the numeraire for sure, inde-\npendent of their current period choice. Therefore wealthy players\u2019 consumption-\nindependent level of the numeraire is higher. Only the additional amount that\nthey might get, that is, their opportunity cost, is lower. The term u(y\u2212 P) in the\nutility function will be dropped for all subsequent calculations as it only reflects a\nconstant.\n20. Heterogeneity in the opportunity costs of consumption (rather than het-\nerogeneity in terms of income) can be taken as primitive to allow for more general\ninterpretations of the model. See Section IV for a discussion.\n632 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS\nconsumer\u2019s type. We consider symmetric pure strategies; that is,\ns(\u03b8 ) is deterministic and the same for firms of the same type. We\ndenote such a strategy by sl(\u00b7) for low-quality firms and by sh(\u00b7) for\nhigh.\nFor a consumer, the relevant information is the combination of\nquality and service he can obtain; the name of the firm fromwhich\nhe can receive some combination is not important. Consequently,\na consumer conditions his actions on the set of quality\u2013service\npairs, which we denote as D \u2286 {ql,qh} \u00d7 {0, s\u00af}. For example, if D\nincludes a pair (ql,0), it means that the consumer knows a firm\nwith quality ql that has not offered him service for the next time he\nreturns. If the consumer has not yet purchased, D = \u2205. A strategy\nfor a consumer of type \u03b8 \u2208 {p, w} is then a pair (\u03c1\u02c6\u03b8 (D), \u03c3 \u03b8 (D)) for\neach D. The term \u03c1\u02c6\u03b8 (D) denotes a threshold for the taste shock:\nIf the taste shock is above \u03c1\u02c6\u03b8 (D), the consumer buys the prod-\nuct, otherwise he does not.21 If he chooses to buy, \u03c3 \u03b8 (D) specifies\nhis purchase decision. If D \u0007= \u2205, then the consumer can obtain\nquality\u2013service combination (q, s) \u2208 D at a firm he already visited,\nhe can follow the choice of either a wealthy or a poor consumer\nobserved in the previous period, or he can search randomly for a\nnew firm. If D = \u2205 only the last option is available, as by assump-\ntion the consumer must search randomly in the first period of\nconsumption.\nLet n\u03b8,t(D) denote the proportion of type \u03b8 consumers with\ninformation D at time t, where the law of motion is determined\nby the strategies of consumers and firms. With this we can define\na stationary equilibrium.\nDEFINITION 1 (Stationary Equilibrium). A stationary equilibrium\nis a vector of strategies and steady state proportions S =\n(sl, sh, (\u03c1\u02c6w, \u03c3w), (\u03c1\u02c6 p, \u03c3 p),nw,np) such that\n1. Consumer Optimality: For each consumer of type \u03b8 , strat-\negy (\u03c1\u02c6\u03b8 , \u03c3 \u03b8 ) is optimal in the continuation game for all D,\nwhen the consumer takes as given the strategies and frac-\ntions of the other players as summarized in S.\n2. Firm Optimality: For each high (low)-quality firm sh (sl) is\noptimal given S.\n3. Stationarity: n\u03b8,t(D) = n\u03b8 (D) \u2200t \u2200D \u2200\u03b8.\n21. In the Appendix we show that threshold strategies are optimal in our\nenvironment.\nSTRATEGIC FIRMS AND CONSUMER EMULATION 633\nIII.D. Optimal Behavior\nTo characterize the equilibria of this game we discuss opti-\nmal choices by consumers first, then optimal choices of firms, and\nfinally we integrate the two.\nConsumer Search. We first analyze the optimal consumption\ndecision for a consumer with opportunity cost u0, which deter-\nmines his frequency of consumption. Fix the strategy of the firms\nand suppose that all high-quality firms offer this consumer iden-\ntical service s (either s\u00af or zero) in every period, and low-quality\nfirms do not offer more service than high-quality firms.22 Assume\nthat the consumer has entered the market at least once, so that\nhe has observed other participants in the market. If the consumer\nhas not found a high-quality firm and chooses to purchase from a\nfirm not previously frequented, there is a probability \u03b3 that this\nfirm will be of high quality. Take for now as exogenous the process\nby which this consumer chooses a new firm, and hence \u03b3 .\nThe consumer\u2019s problem is a standard search problem with\none exception\u2014the consumer only searches in periods in which his\ntaste shock is sufficiently high. His decisions about how frequently\nto search and how to choose firms given the frequency of search\nare linked: an individual who consumes more frequently will be\nmore likely to search for a combination of high quality and service,\nand higher quality or service induces higher frequency of search.\nThe optimal strategy for the consumer once he has found\na high-quality firm is to consume whenever his taste shock ex-\nceeds the threshold \u03c1\u02c6h = u0 \u2212 qh \u2212 s. This threshold is intuitive:\nHe gets either his outside option u0 or his consumption utility\nqh + s+ \u03c1, and he is indifferent if u0 = qh + s+ \u03c1\u02c6h.23 If the con-\nsumer has not found a high-quality firm, the threshold at which\nhe will consume, \u03c1\u02c6l, has a similar structure but incorporates the\ninformational value of experimentation (see Lemma 1 in the Ap-\npendix). We will focus on a consumer who is sufficiently patient\nso that he will continue searching until he finds a high-quality\n22. We will show that it is always profitable for a high-quality firm to provide\nservice if it is profitable for a low-quality firm to provide service.\n23. To ensure that a threshold exists that leads to indifference, we assume that\nthe support of the taste shock satisfies the following: (\u03c1, \u03c1\u00af) \u2283 [uw0 \u2212 qh \u2212 s\u00af,u\np\n0 \u2212 ql].\nThis implies that \u03c1 + qh + s\u00af < uw0 , so that even in the most advantageous situation\nof high quality and high service, there are taste shocks sufficiently low so that not\nconsuming is preferable. Analogously, even in the most disadvantageous situation\nsome taste shocks still induce the consumer to enter the market.\n634 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS\nfirm if all firms offer service, that is, on consumers for whom the\nsurvival probability \u03b4 \u2265 \u03b4 for some \u03b4.24\nThese thresholds for consumption depend on the opportu-\nnity cost of consumption, which is lower for the wealthy than for\nthe poor. Therefore, if wealthy and poor consumers are treated\nequally by firms, the wealthy will consume more frequently both\nbefore and after identifying a high-quality firm (Lemma 3 in the\nAppendix). This is essentially a restatement of our formulation\nof the normal goods assumption. If the wealthy receive service\nwhereas the poor do not, the gap between the frequencies with\nwhich the two groups search is amplified. Only if service is given\nonly to the poor and the impact of service outweighs the difference\nin the opportunity costs of consuming is it possible that the poor\nconsume more frequently than the wealthy.\nIf consumers from some group purchasemore frequently, they\nwill be the leaders, as they on average possess better information.\nLet \u03b3 w and \u03b3 p be respectively the proportions of the wealthy and\nthe poor who have identified a high-quality firm. The following\nproposition formalizes the conditions under which following the\nwealthy is preferable to following the poor.\nPROPOSITION 1. Let \u03b4 \u2208 (\u03b4,1), \u03b3 \u2208 (\u03bb,1), and assume that high-\nquality firms provide weakly higher service to consumers\n(sh(\u00b7) \u2265 sl(\u00b7)). Then there exists \u03bd\u02c6\u03b3 > up0 \u2212 uw0 such that\n(i) If the rich receive weakly higher service from high-quality\nfirms than the poor (sh(w) \u2265 sh(p)) or if service is not very\nimportant (s\u00af < \u03bd\u02c6\u03b3 ), then the rich generate a better signal\n(\u03b3 w > \u03b3 p > \u03bb).\n(ii) If the poor receive strictly more service from high-quality\nfirms than the rich (sh(p) > sh(w)) and service is very im-\nportant (s\u00af > \u03bd\u02c6\u03b3 ), then the poor generate a better signal\n(\u03b3 p > \u03b3 w > \u03bb).\nNote that following any consumer, wealthy or poor, is strictly\npreferable to searching randomly. At worst, the consumer who is\nfollowed has not found a high-quality firm yet, in which case the\nfirm he or she purchased from is as likely to be high-quality as a\nrandomly sampled firm. In addition, there is a positive probability\n24. The consumer foregoes service while searching, which could deter him\nfrom searching when service is important and his discount factor is low. If the\nimportance of service relative to quality is not too large, the consumer would want\nto search at any discount factor. Lemma 2 in the Appendix presents the formal\nargument.\nSTRATEGIC FIRMS AND CONSUMER EMULATION 635\nthat the consumerwho is beingmimicked has found a high-quality\nfirm and purchases only from that firm. Second, all consumers\nsample in a way that gives the highest probability of identifying a\nhigh-quality firm. Thus, both the uninformed wealthy consumers\nand the uninformed poor follow the same group and face the same\n(endogenous) probability \u03b3 of finding a high-quality firm.\nThe calculations of \u03b3 w and \u03b3 p, the proportions of the two\ngroups who had identified a high-quality firm, were based on a\ngiven probability \u03b3 of finding a high-quality firm when searching.\nWhen searching consumers are following a particular group, the\nprobability \u03b3 must equal the proportion of that group who have\nidentified a high-quality firm. We prove the existence of such a\nfixed point in the Appendix (Lemma 4).\nFirms\u2019 Behavior. We turn to service provision by the firms.\nWe will show that it is profitable for a high-quality firm to provide\nservice to a consumer if he is followed by sufficiently many other\nconsumers, and that high-quality firms always provide at least as\nhigh a service level as low-quality firms. In any stationary equi-\nlibrium, if a high-quality firm promises service in any period s\u00af to a\nconsumer, the consumer will return the next period he enters the\nmarket, regardless of his expectations about future service: Ac-\ncepting the optimal per-period outcome of high quality and high\nservice and searching thereafter for a new firm dominates search-\ning immediately. Thus high-quality firms can always ensure the\nreturn of a consumer by promising him service. The question is\nwhen this will be profitable.\nConsider the case in which there are few wealthy consumers\nand many poor consumers: \u03b1 is small and the ratio (1\u2212 \u03b1)\/\u03b1\nof poor to wealthy consumers is large. If consumers follow the\nwealthy, thismeans that each visit by a wealthy consumer induces\nfuture business from many poor followers (and some wealthy fol-\nlowers). There are two benefits to a high-quality firm from of-\nfering service. The first is the effect of \u201ccompetitive pressure.\u201d If\nother high-quality firms offer service to the wealthy, the consumer\nmay never return, but rather search for another firm that offers\nboth high quality and high service. Offering service ensures that\nthe consumer will return the next time he wants to consume, in\nwhich case the firm reaps the profit from the large number of fol-\nlowers that succeed him. The second effect is an \u201cencouragement\neffect.\u201d Even if the consumer returns to this firm despite the ab-\nsence of service, he will return more frequently if the firm offers\n636 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS\nservice, and the business generated by his followers will increase.\nWhen there are many followers it is profitable to incur the cost of\nservice.25\nMoreover, it is indeed optimal for high-quality firms to outbid\nlow-quality firms in their pursuit of valuable customers. If it is\nprofitable for a low-quality firm to provide service to a consumer,\nit is also profitable for a high-quality firm to provide service in\norder to keep the business of this consumer. We summarize the\nresults in the following proposition. We denote the proportions of\nwealthy and poor as follows: \u03b1w = \u03b1 and \u03b1p = 1 \u2212 \u03b1.\nPROPOSITION 2. Let \u03b4 \u2208 (\u03b4,1).\n(i) Suppose all uninformed consumers follow consumers of\ntype \u03b8 \u2208 {w, p}. If there are many consumers of the other\ntype (\u03b1\u03b8 < \u03b1\u00af for some \u03b1\u00af > 0), in any stationary equilibrium\nconsumers of type \u03b8 receive service (sh(\u03b8 ) = s\u00af).\n(ii) In any stationary equilibrium, either high-quality firms\nprovide more service than low-quality firms (sh(\u03b8 ) \u2265 sl(\u03b8 )\nfor \u03b8 \u2208 {p, w}), or consumers of type \u03b8 nevertheless do not\nreturn to low-quality firms even when they offer service\nand high-quality firms do not.\nIII.E. Equilibria\nWith these results on optimal strategies for consumers and\nfirms in hand, we turn to the stationary equilibria of the game. We\nfirst provide a necessary condition for equilibria when the value\nof service is not too large. In any such equilibrium, the poor follow\nthe wealthy, and if service is provided, it is provided only to the\nwealthy. This is driven by the fact that the wealthy accumulate\ninformation faster than the poor.\nPROPOSITION 3. Let \u03b4 \u2208 (\u03b4,1). There exists \u03bd > up0 \u2212 uw0 such that\nthe following holds: If service is not too important (s\u00af < \u03bd), then\nin any stationary equilibrium all uninformed consumers fol-\nlow wealthy consumers after their initial purchase; if service\nis provided, it is provided only to the wealthy.\n25. A similar argument applies if there are few poor leaders, that is, if the\nratio \u03b1\/(1 \u2212 \u03b1) of wealthy to poor consumers is large and if the provision of service\nto the poor induces them to consume more frequently than the rich. In this case\nthey will be followed and high-quality firms will find it beneficial to provide them\nservice.\nSTRATEGIC FIRMS AND CONSUMER EMULATION 637\nThus for moderate service levels the wealthy will always be\nthe leaders. This will happen even for some levels of service that\noutweigh the difference in outside options. In this case, even if\nonly the poor receive service and consume more often once they\nhave found a high-quality firm (by Lemma 3 in the Appendix),\nthey are not followed because they search less frequently than the\nwealthy when they have not found a high-quality firm. There is\na partial converse to Proposition 3: The poor can arise as leaders\nwhen service is very important. If s\u00af is large and is exclusively\nprovided to the poor, then they will consume so frequently that\nthey find high-quality places faster than the wealthy and will be\nfollowed. The encouragement effect thus opens up the possibility\nof multiple equilibria in which either the rich or the poor might be\nfollowed. If one of the groups is acknowledged as the leaders, the\nfirms might strategically provide service to this group because of\nthe followers, which in turn supports their position as the leaders.\nWhether service provision is profitable for the firms depends\non the number of followers an individual has. Since P < c service\nwill only be provided when the profit generated by one\u2019s follow-\ners is sufficiently large. We establish existence and uniqueness\nseparately for the cases when there are many or few poor.26 For\nsome of the equilibrium analysis it is important whether con-\nsumers who are followed only by others of the same type would\nreceive service. This cannot be the case when the survival prob-\nability \u03b4 is sufficiently high because in this case most consumers\nwill have found a high-quality firm and very few are searching.\nSince the price does not cover the cost of service, it will not be\nprofitable to provide service if a consumer only has very few fol-\nlowers. That is, there exists a value \u03b4\u2217 such that for survival rates\ngreater than \u03b4\u2217, no firm would find it profitable to provide service\nto consumers who are only followed by consumers of their own\ntype.27\nThe following proposition establishes existence of equilibria\nwhen the ratio of poor to wealthy consumers is sufficiently large.\nAll equilibria exhibit service only for the wealthy customers if\n\u03b4 is sufficiently high or service is lower than the threshold \u03bd in\nProposition 3.\n26. We have not shown that the fixed point distribution when the rich follow\nthemselves is unique. Also, service by low-quality firms might make no difference\nto the consumers\u2019 search. Therefore equilibria might not be unique, but all exhibit\nthe properties we establish.\n27. See Lemma 8 in the Appendix.\n638 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS\nPROPOSITION 4. Fix \u03b4 \u2208 (\u03b4,1) and s\u00af > 0. If the fraction of wealthy\npeople is small (\u03b1 \u2264 \u03b1\u2217 for some \u03b1\u2217 \u2208 (0,1)), then the following\nhold:\n(i) There exist stationary equilibria in which all consumers\nfollow wealthy consumers while searching. Consumers\nstop searching only when they find a high-quality firm,\nand high-quality firms offer service to the wealthy and not\nto the poor. Low-quality firms may offer service but do not\nattract repeat business.\n(ii) All stationary equilibria are of this form if service is not\ntoo important (s\u00af < \u03bd), or if the survival rate is high (\u03b4 > \u03b4\u2217).\nThe proposition shows that firms indeed support the learn-\ning process when the service can be concentrated on sufficiently\nfew wealthy people who achieve high visibility in the market. For\nall consumers the outcome is clearly preferred to a world in which\nservice is absent. Wealthy consumers benefit directly from the ser-\nvice and indirectly because they obtain high quality faster. Poor\ncustomers benefit also, but only indirectly through the improved\nsearch externality provided by the wealthy. High-quality firms\nbenefit because consumers find high-quality firms faster. How-\never, their cost of providing service might outweigh this benefit.\nLow-quality firms unambiguously lose compared to a world with-\nout firms\u2019 ability to affect the consumers\u2019 search process. Service\nincreases the informational externality between consumers, and\na newborn consumer samples, on average, fewer low-quality firms\nbefore finding high quality.\nAs a comparison, we analyze the case in which the ratio of\nwealthy to poor players is reversed. If there are few poor people,\nthere is always an equilibrium in which everybody follows the\nwealthy. Only if service is sufficiently important is there also a\nsecond equilibrium in which everybody follows the poor.\nPROPOSITION 5. Fix \u03b4 > max{\u03b4, \u03b4\u2217} and s\u00af > 0. If the fraction of poor\npeople is small (\u03b1 \u2265 \u03b1\u2217\u2217 for some \u03b1\u2217\u2217 \u2208 (0,1)), then the follow-\ning hold:\n(i) There exist stationary equilibria in which all consumers\nfollow wealthy consumers while searching. Consumers\nstop searching only when they find a high-quality firm.\nHigh-quality firms do not offer service to any consumer.\nLow-quality firms may offer service but do not attract re-\npeat business. If the importance of service is not too high\n(s\u00af < \u03bd), these are the only equilibria.\nSTRATEGIC FIRMS AND CONSUMER EMULATION 639\n(ii) There is \u03bd \u2032 > up0 \u2212 uw0 such that the following holds: If ser-\nvice is very important (s\u00af > \u03bd \u2032), there also exist equilibria in\nwhich all consumers follow poor consumers while search-\ning. Consumers stop searching only when they find a high-\nquality firm. High-quality firms offer service to the poor\nand not to the wealthy. Low-quality firms may offer ser-\nvice but do not attract repeat business.\n(iii) There do not exist stationary equilibria with other proper-\nties.\nProposition 5 demonstrates the natural advantage that the\nwealthy possess in information gathering. Following the wealthy\nis always an equilibrium, as in the absence of service it is best\nfor everybody to follow them. Only if service is very attractive\nwill the poor search sufficiently frequently so that following them\ncan be worthwhile. It is worth noticing that all consumers are\nbetter off in environments in which service is provided than in\nenvironments in which no service is provided. This is immedi-\nate for the group getting the service, but even the other group\nbenefits from a better signal. This implies here that all con-\nsumers are better off in the equilibrium where consumers fol-\nlow the poor and the poor obtain service than in the equilib-\nrium in which all follow the rich and the rich do not receive\nservice.\nPropositions 4 and 5 establish that it is the information that\nis revealed in the choices of the wealthier players that makes\nthem valuable to other players and, by extension, to firms. If\nthere are sufficiently many consumers who value this informa-\ntion, the wealthy are in a unique position to profit from this if\nservice is not too valuable. Poor consumers are not substitutes for\nthe wealthy, as their actions reveal less information than those\nof the wealthy, even if the visibility of the poor is much better\nwhen there are fewer of them. Note that we have effectively ruled\nout trigger strategies in the analysis.28 Hence, firms\u2019 decisions are\nprimarily influenced by the per period contribution of a customer.\nThus, it is not the frequency of consumption per se that allows\nwealthier consumers to command service, but rather the induced\ninformation that is valued by other consumers, and in turn by the\nfirms.\n28. Thesewould have allowed richer customers to impose harsher punishment\non firms, as their overall lifetime consumption is higher and their effective discount\nfactor is higher due to more frequent consumption.\n640 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS\nIV. DISCUSSION\nAlthough we focused on differences in income as a source of\nconsumer heterogeneity, the model is easily amenable to other in-\nterpretations. Also, the basic model omits the discussion of inter-\nesting aspects of social interaction such as conspicuous consump-\ntion, popularity, and the importance of relative position in society.\nWe briefly discuss these in light of examples given in the Intro-\nduction. We also consider the robustness of our results to more\ndirect price competition and relate our results to the literature.\nIV.A. Interpretation of Consumer Differences\nOur interpretation of the different opportunity costsuw0 and u\np\n0\nis derived from differences in income that affect the consumers\u2019\nbudget constraints. Alternatively, uw0 and u\np\n0 could be taken as\nprimitives that result from heterogeneity with respect to charac-\nteristics other than income, such as differences in tastes. If you\nlook for a Swedish restaurant, Swedes might have a greater pref-\nerence than the average consumer, that is, have lower u0. For\nrunning shoes, runners will consume more, and good jazz places\nare most likely discovered by following jazz enthusiasts. For some\nof our examples, such as Reebok\u2019s sponsoring of local triathletes\nor product support to ski instructors, differences in preferences\nseem the relevant explanation. Although our analysis can eas-\nily handle exogenous differences, our focus on income differences\nstems from two observations. For normal goods, income differ-\nences will induce higher consumption for the wealthy. More im-\nportantly, in many situations income differences might be easier\nto infer than differences in taste. If taste heterogeneity is similar\nfor different income categories but only income differences are ob-\nservable, then the firms\u2019 treatment decisions and the consumers\u2019\ndecisions on whom to follow will be based on the observable\ncharacteristic.\nIV.B. Conspicuous Consumption\nThe ability to distinguish different types of consumers is im-\nportant in our framework. Even income differences are typically\nnot observable per se, but must be inferred from some attribute,\nfor example, from the suit one wears or the car one drives. This\nsuggests a rational basis for conspicuous consumption. One could\nextend our model to include an additional good that is observ-\nable, such as clothing. By a standard signaling argument, those\nSTRATEGIC FIRMS AND CONSUMER EMULATION 641\nwho consume our good more frequently would rationally choose\nto spend the money on the conspicuous good if it leads to greater\nservice, whereas less frequent purchasers would not. In this en-\nvironment the welfare of all new-born consumers\u2014rich or poor\u2014\ncan be higher in the presence of conspicuous consumption despite\nits cost, since agents\u2019 decisions on whom to follow become more\nprecise. These positive externalities from a more efficient search\nprocess can outweigh the deadweight loss.\nIV.C. Popularity\nWe have assumed that consumers of the same type have\nthe same number of followers. While this might be a reason-\nable assumption among anonymous consumers in day-to-day\nconsumption settings, this clearly does not hold for our example of\ncelebrities who receive expensive swag. Celebrities have a higher\nvisibility than other people of similar income and\u2014according to\nthe logic underlying our analysis\u2014will have more followers and\nare more likely to get serviced. The extent of the knowledge about\nthe product interacts with this visibility advantage, leading to\nvaluable gifts mainly in those areas where knowledge is perceived\nto be high.\nIV.D. The Race for Relative Position\nOur model delivers a benefit from being relatively more in-\nformed or visible than one\u2019s peers. It is the relatively richer agents\nthat in general become market leaders and benefit from that.\nIn this paper we do not model the competition for better relative\nstanding, yet the environment clearly induces a race for better rel-\native standing if income or visibility is endogenized. The strength\nof the incentive depends on the number of occasions in which bet-\nter service is obtained by the leading group.\nIV.E. Fixed Price\nWe took the price as being exogenously set, and identical\nacross firms regardless of quality. Even if prices differed across\nfirms, it is unrealistic to think that they would perfectly convey\nthe quality of firms, and there would remain the possibility that\nsocial learning of the sort in our model would still play a role.\nNevertheless it is worth discussing what the equilibria of a model\nsuch as we have laid out would look like if prices were a strategic\nvariable rather than exogenously set. Suppose that firms chose\nprices strategically and that there was a symmetric equilibrium\n642 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS\nin which all low-quality firms set one price and all high-quality\nfirms set a possibly different price. If the difference in quality\nbetween the high- and low-quality firms is small, there may be\na separating equilibrium in which the prices of the two types of\nfirms are not very different, and wealthy people go to high-quality\nfirms whereas the poor go to cheaper, low-quality firms. Suppose,\nhowever, that there was little or no value to the low-quality firm;\nthat is, even at very low prices all consumers would prefer the\nhigh-quality firm. There clearly cannot be a separating equilib-\nrium then because low-quality firms could profitably charge the\nsame price as high-quality firms. If all firms charge the same\nprice, whether any single firm has an incentive to deviate depends\non consumers\u2019 beliefs when they see an out-of-equilibrium price.\nTrivially, if consumers believe that it is a low-quality firm that\ndeviates, such a deviating firm will attract no new customers.29 A\nhigh-quality firm that increased its price slightly could possibly\nretain its current customer base, since those customers know the\nquality and there is a cost to finding another high-quality firm.\nThere is a limit to the increase that is possible without current\ncustomers searching for an alternative high-quality firm. There\nis thus a trade-off between the increase in profits a high-quality\nfirm can obtain by raising its price to its current clientele and\nthe lost profits from the absence of new customers. If the price\nat which firms pool is set sufficiently high, the second effect out-\nweighs the first and firms find it unprofitable to increase their\nprice.\nThus, although it is beyond the scope of this paper to formally\ninclude strategic pricing, it is reasonable to expect that the equal\npricing that we assumed would characterize one equilibrium.\nIV.F. Related Literature\nOur work is related to two strands of literature: social learn-\ning from the choices of others, and economic analysis of social\nenvironments. For the former, the idea that consumers condi-\ntion their search process on observations of others is already em-\nbedded in Nelson\u2019s (1970) idea of guided sampling in consumer\nsearch. Formal economic models have been proposed in the lit-\nerature on social learning in which consumers make inferences\n29. In fact, a firm that increased its price would attract no new customers\neven if the consumers believed that all firms were equally likely to set the higher\nprice.\nSTRATEGIC FIRMS AND CONSUMER EMULATION 643\nabout the quality of a good by observing what other consumers\nhave done.30 A sequence of one-time buyers who can observe\nthe choices of their predecessors has been analyzed in Banerjee\n(1992), Bikhchandani, Hirshleifer, and Welch (1992) and Bose\net al. (forthcoming, 2006). Smallwood and Conlisk (1979), Ellison\nand Fudenberg (1995), and Banerjee and Fudenberg (2004) model\ninformation transmission when many consumers move simulta-\nneously in each period. Bolton and Harris (1999) and Bergemann\nand Valimaki (1996, 2000) analyze strategic experimentation un-\nder the assumption that a finite number of agents decide simul-\ntaneously and repeatedly. McFadden and Train (1996) consider a\nthree-period model experimentation problem in which consumers\u2019\nexperience with the good is an idiosyncratic permanent draw.\nThese models consider ex ante identical consumers who\nchoose among two alternatives, of which at least one has unknown\ncharacteristics. Since consumers are identical, these models ab-\nstract from the social environment in which some consumers may\nendogenously arise as leaders and others as followers based on\ntheir underlying characteristics. Consequently, the central point\nof the present paper is absent. Additionally, these papers con-\nsider a different informational problem by considering a decision\nbetween two alternative products for which agents learn the rel-\native attractiveness over time. In the present work we consider a\nlarge number of alternatives, some of which have higher quality\nthan others. Optimal experimentation does not rely on the rel-\native information on one product compared to the other, but on\nthe relative information accumulated in one group of consumers\nrelative to the other group of consumers. This determines which\ngroup of consumers arises as market leader.\nThe economic analysis of social environments generally fo-\ncuses on the interplay between economic forces and some social\nforce that is not directly priced in the market. In his influen-\ntial contribution, Veblen (1934) explains the purchase of certain\nconspicuous consumption goods for the mere reason of appearing\nwealthy to others. The prestige of being regarded as rich arguably\nhas many components. The present work derives prestige endoge-\nnously from the fact that people who appear wealthy are treated\nbetter by firms because they attract additional business to them.\n30. There is research in other fields on the degree to which consumer choice\nis influenced by other people. See Rogers (1995) for an overview of the marketing\nliterature.\n644 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS\nAnother reason to accumulate wealth or engage in conspic-\nuous consumption arises if higher wealth leads to more attrac-\ntive partners in the marriage market.31 The current paper can be\nviewed as complementary, as it establishes another channel apart\nfrom a matching market by which affluent individuals benefit.\nOur model is completely integrated into a market environment,\nyet the information externality that the lead consumers provide\nyields them additional benefits.\nWhen conspicuous consumption goods are produced by a mo-\nnopolist the signaling game can lead to fashion cycles. Pesendorfer\n(1995) shows that the monopolist first introduces a fashion to the\nattractive agents and then expands it slowly to the larger market\nbefore introducing a new design. Because knowledgeable agents\nin our model have a desire to distinguish themselves from other\nagents, a similar logic might apply. To the extent that fashion is\ncorrelated with higher consumption (and thus information) about\nother products, we would expect fashionable people to be treated\nbetter not only in the marriage market.\nBecker and Murphy (2000) provide a general approach to so-\ncial interaction by modeling social capital as a stock variable that\nacts as a complement to other choice variables. They mention in-\nformational linkage as one form of such complementarity social\ncapital: \u201cA person may copy the choices made by others because he\nfeels they have superior information\u201d (Becker and Murphy 2000,\np. 10). We model this linkage explicitly and derive social pres-\ntige in terms of better treatment as well as a desire by others\nto follow the influential as an informational phenomenon. Our\nexplicit formulation has the advantage of showing the links pre-\ncisely and allows predictions when the environment changes. For\nexample, changes in the relative size of the consumer groups,\nin the relative income of the two groups, or in the number of\npeople who can observe a given consumer (i.e., through media\nbroadcasting) have structural implications for the service provi-\nsion in the market. Becker and Murphy also discuss other rea-\nsons to associate with certain high-status individuals, such as\ndirect utility from being in their proximity. We conclude by laying\nout the differences in predictions between these explanations and\nours.\n31. Cole, Mailath, and Postlewaite (1995) explore conspicuous consumption\nas signaling.\nSTRATEGIC FIRMS AND CONSUMER EMULATION 645\nV. CONCLUSION\nWe laid out a model in which some consumers endogenously\narise as the more informed market leaders. Their consumption\nchoices influence the purchase decisions of the other consumers\nin the market. Firms strategically engage in the search process\nby differential provision of service. In equilibrium service accrues\nonly to more informed groups.\nThere is another explanation for the phenomenon that some\npeople are leaders in the market, based on the followers\u2019 desire\nto be like the leaders. For example, Becker and Murphy (2000)\npoint out that \u201cfollowers may gain acceptance and prestige by em-\nulating the behavior of leaders.\u201d Becker and Murphy model this\nby incorporating social capital directly as part of the consumers\u2019\npreferences but conclude that many insights are \u201calso applicable\nwhen complementarities are due to technological or informational\nlinkages.\u201d A similar insight applies in part to our model, in the\nsense that some conclusions would arise even if consumers fol-\nlowed the leaders for other than informational reasons. Service\nprovision to leaders would still be warranted. Nevertheless, we\nthink it is insightful to model the informational channel explic-\nitly, as it sheds light on who is likely to be followed in a market\nenvironment. This leads to testable predictions that differ from\nother explanations.\nAn explanation based on the desire to be associated with the\nprestige of the leaders suggests that the leaders are those in su-\nperior social or economic conditions. Our baseline model yields\nsimilar predictions by identifying the wealthy and the visible as\nthe market leaders for the case of a normal good. If the good\nunder consideration is an inferior good, then the people being\nfollowed will be the poorer individuals. For example, it seems nat-\nural to follow professors rather than students in pursuit of a good\nglass of wine, but for a good beer it might be more profitable to\nfollow the students.32 This link between the normal or inferior\nnature of a good and the material status of the leading group\ndistinguishes our approach from others and can in principle be\ntested.\n32. There are other observations that seem inconsistent with the notion of fol-\nlowing others for reasons of association. The linguistics literature shows adoption\nof language patters from poor ghetto areas in residential neighborhoods. Although\nour analysis is silent about this issue, the issue does not conform well with the\nnotion of preferences for association.\n646 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS\nIn general our model predicts that those who are more knowl-\nedgeable will be leaders to the extent that they can be identified.\nOne clearly identifiable trait is gender. If one subscribes to the\nidea that women still undertake a larger part of the shopping ac-\ntivities, our model would suggest they will tend to be leaders in\nthe market. An informational argument seems to us more plausi-\nble to explain why females are more likely to be leaders in many\nproduct categories (Feik and Price 1987) than an argument based\non association with higher social status.\nFinally, an informational argument seems more plausible in\nbusiness-to-business transactions, where the customers are them-\nselves profit-maximizing firms. In our example of SAP customers\nit is unlikely that firms emulate others for the sake of association,\nbut rather interpret the buying decisions as revealing about the\nquality of the software. The extent to which information transfer\nthrough lead consumers shapes industry competition when qual-\nity is endogenized might be a fruitful avenue for future research.\nIn general there might be a variety of reasons that consumers\nmimic the choices of others. We view the informational compo-\nnent as important and show how this translates into differen-\ntial treatment of consumers and leadership status in a market\nenvironment.\nAPPENDIX: DETAILS OF THE PROOFS\nLEMMA 1. Consider a consumer with opportunity cost u0 who has\nconsumed in the market before and draws high-quality firms\nwith probability \u03b3 while searching. Let q be the highest qual-\nity he has yet encountered. If \u03b4 \u2208 (\u03b4,1) and high-quality firms\noffer service s that is at least as high as the service offered by\nlow-quality firms, then the consumer\u2019s optimal decision rule\nhas the following structure:\nIf q = ql, he samples a new firm if current period shock\n\u03c1 \u2265 \u03c1\u02c6l = u0 \u2212 qh \u2212 s; otherwise he does not consume. If q = qh,\nthen he returns to the firm with high quality if the current\nperiod shock\n\u03c1 \u2265 \u03c1\u02c6h = u0 \u2212 E(q) \u2212 \u03b4\u03b31 \u2212 \u03b4\n\u222b \u03c1\u02c6l\n\u03c1\u02c6h\n[1 \u2212 F(\u03c1)]d\u03c1;\notherwise he does not consume.\nProof. We consider first the case where the consumer is\npromised the same service s \u2208 {0, s\u00af} from every firm in every\nSTRATEGIC FIRMS AND CONSUMER EMULATION 647\nperiod. It is straightforward to extend this to the case where low-\nquality firms promise less. We will work with average discounted\npayoffs. The functional equation for sampling with recall, given\nthat the best quality the consumer has yet encountered is q, and\ngiven the current shock \u03c1, can be written as\nVC(q, \u03c1) = max{(1\u2212 \u03b4)(q + s+ \u03c1) + \u03b4E\u03c1 \u2032VC(q, \u03c1 \u2032),\n(1\u2212 \u03b4)(Eq|\u03b3 (q)+ \u03c1) + \u03b4Eq\u02dc|\u03b3 E\u03c1 \u2032 max{VC(q, \u03c1 \u2032),VC(q\u02dc, \u03c1 \u2032)},\n(1 \u2212 \u03b4)u0 + \u03b4E\u03c1 \u2032VC(q, \u03c1 \u2032)},(1)\nwhere the first line describes the utility from returning to a known\nfirmwith quality q, the second line random sampling, and the last\nline consumption of the numeraire.33 Ex denotes the expectation\noperator with regard to variable x. x = q|\u03b3 refers to variable q\nwhen the probability of high quality is \u03b3 . We dropped the decision-\nirrelevant constant u(y\u2212 P).\nFrom (1) note that VC(q, \u03c1) is weakly increasing in q. There-\nfore for q = qh the first line in the max-operator is larger than the\nsecond. Thus, whenever a consumer with state variable qh enters\nthe market, he will return to the firm with quality qh rather than\nsample a new one. He enters the market if the taste shock is high\nenough, that is, higher than \u03c1\u02c6h \u2208 (\u03c1, \u03c1\u00af) that makes the player in-\ndifferent between not consuming (line 3 in equation (1)) or going\ninto the market (line 1), so that\n(1 \u2212 \u03b4)(qh + s+ \u03c1\u02c6h) + \u03b4E\u03c1 \u2032VC(qh, \u03c1 \u2032) = (1 \u2212 \u03b4)u0 + \u03b4E\u03c1 \u2032VC(qh, \u03c1 \u2032)\nor \u03c1\u02c6h = u0 \u2212 qh \u2212 s. Then in any given period the ex ante probabil-\nity that this player will enter the market is [1 \u2212 F(u0 \u2212 qh \u2212 s)],\nwhereas the ex ante probability of not consuming is F(u0 \u2212 qh \u2212 s).\nKnowing this, the expected average discounted payoff is\nE\u03c1 \u2032VC(qh, \u03c1 \u2032) =\n\u222b \u03c1\u00af\n\u03c1\nmax{qh + s+ \u03c1,u0}dF(\u03c1)\n= u0 +\n\u222b \u03c1\u00af\nu0\u2212qh\u2212s\n[1 \u2212 F(\u03c1)]d\u03c1,(2)\nwhere the second equality follows from integration by parts.\n33. The equation is a contractionmapping, so by standard arguments a unique\nsolutions exists when [\u03c1, \u03c1\u00af] is bounded. When \u03c1 = \u2212\u221e this still holds because at\nvery low taste shocks, the consumer takes the outside option, so that the shock\ndoes not affect his utility, and we can bound the payoff space.\n648 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS\nNow consider q = ql. Assume that searching for a higher-\nquality firm is preferable to returning to the low-quality firm and\nobtaining service in the next period. (We will show in the subse-\nquent proof of Lemma 2 that this is indeed optimal.) The threshold\n\u03c1\u02c6l for the taste shock is now given by the equality of lines 2 and 3\nin (1), which can be simplified to yield\n(3)\n\u03b4\u03b3\n1 \u2212 \u03b4 [E\u03c1 \u2032V\nC(qh, \u03c1 \u2032) \u2212 E\u03c1 \u2032VC(ql, \u03c1 \u2032)] = u0 \u2212 Eq|\u03b3 (q\u02dc) \u2212 \u03c1\u02c6l.\nTaking \u03c1\u02c6l as given, we can express the expected value as\nE\u03c1 \u2032VC(ql, \u03c1 \u2032) = F(\u03c1\u02c6l)[(1\u2212 \u03b4)u0 + \u03b4E\u03c1 \u2032VC(ql, \u03c1 \u2032)]\n+ [1 \u2212 F(\u03c1\u02c6l)](1\u2212 \u03b4)\n[\nEq|\u03b3 (q) + E\u03c1 \u2032 (\u03c1 \u2032|\u03c1 \u2032 \u2265 \u03c1\u02c6l)\n]\n+ [1\u2212 F(\u03c1\u02c6l)]\u03b4[\u03b3 E\u03c1 \u2032VC(qh, \u03c1 \u2032)+ (1\u2212 \u03b3 )E\u03c1 \u2032VC(ql, \u03c1 \u2032)].\nThe first line weights the opportunity cost of consumption by the\nprobability F(\u03c1\u02c6l) of not consuming.

Clearly (\u2202\u03b3 \u03b8\/\u2202C\u03b8 ) > 0. Therefore\n\u03b3 w > \u03b3 p if Cp < Cw and Bp < Bw, which is by Lemma 3 the case\nfor sh(w) \u2265 sh(p) or s\u00af < up0 \u2212 uw0 .By the same lemma sh(p) \u2212 sh(w) =\ns\u00af > \u03bd\u03b3 implies Cp > Cw and Bp > Bw, which in turn implies \u03b3 w <\n\u03b3 p.

If sh(p) \u2212 sh(w) \u2248 up0 \u2212 uw0 , then Cp \u2248\nCw but Bp < Bw, and therefore \u03b3 w > \u03b3 p. If sh(p) \u2212 sh(w) \u2248 \u03bd\u03b3 , then\nCp > Cw but Bp \u2248 Bw, and therefore \u03b3 w < \u03b3 p. If sh(p) \u2212 sh(w) = s\u00af \u2208\n(up0 \u2212 uw0 , \u03bd\u03b3 ), an increase in s\u00af increases Cp and Bp but leaves Cw\nand Bw unchanged, and there exists a unique \u03bd\u02c6\u03b3 \u2208 (up0 \u2212 uw0 , \u03bd\u03b3 ) for\nwhich sh(p) \u2212 sh(w) = \u03bd\u02c6\u03b3 implies \u03b3 w < \u03b3 p.

In a stationary equilibrium, a con-\nsumer who purchases from a firm has the same expected number\nof followers in every period. Thus, the benefit to a firm from a sin-\ngle visit of a particular customer is the following: The customer\npays price P, potentially receives service at cost c > P, and in-\nduces the expected discounted lifetime equilibrium profit that the\nfirm receives from his next-period followers. Call this benefit \u000f. \u000f\nis an equilibrium object that depends on the strategies of the firm\nin question as well as the strategies of other firms and consumers.\nIf a firm deviates and promises s\u2032 instead of the equilibrium\npromise s, the benefit of the next return visit is \u000f \u2212 (c(s\u2032) \u2212 c(s)).\nBecause in a stationary equilibrium after a one-shot deviation the\ncontinuation game is unchanged once the customer returns, only\nthe immediate cost of service changes from c(s) to c(s\u2032). In par-\nticular, the behavior of the customer once he returns, as well as\nthe behavior of the followers, is unchanged. Yet it might delay the\nconsumer\u2019s return, as now consumption is less valuable compared\nto the opportunity cost of consumption. If the consumer switches\nto a competitor, \u000f \u2212 (c(s\u2032) \u2212 c(s)) may in fact never be realized.\nWe will derive \u000f for the following case: All consumers follow\nthe wealthy, the wealthy are promised service by high-quality and\nnot by low-quality firms, and no firm promises service to the poor.\n654 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS\nThe benefit of a wealthy consumer to a high-quality firm is\n\u000fwh = P \u2212 c + \u03b2Nw\u000fwh\n[\n1 + \u03b4\u03b2\n1 \u2212 \u03b4\u03b2 (1 \u2212 F(u\nw\n0 \u2212 qh \u2212 s))\n]\n+ \u03b2Nwc\n+\u03b2NpP\n[\n1 + \u03b4\u03b2\n1 \u2212 \u03b4\u03b2 (1 \u2212 F(u\np\n0 \u2212 qh))\n]\n.(13)\nIt comprises the wealthy consumer\u2019s own contribution P \u2212 c, plus\nthe lifetime contributions of his followers.

Finally, there are\nNp = \u03d5\np\nl\n\u03d5wl + \u03d5wh\n1 \u2212 \u03b1\n\u03b1\npoor consumers who follow in the next period. In every subsequent\nperiod they consume with probability 1 \u2212 F(up0 \u2212 qh) if they sur-\nvive. They generate benefit P each time they consume. For other\ncases \u000f can be constructed analogously.\nWe will prove Proposition 2 in Lemmas 5, 6, and 7. The first\nof these lemmas establishes that a leader\u2019s benefit to a firm can be\narbitrarily high if he is followed by sufficiently many customers\nof the other type. To state the lemma, recall that \u03b1w = \u03b1 and\n\u03b1p = 1 \u2212 \u03b1.\nLEMMA 5. Fix M > 0. Assume type \u03b8 customers are being followed\nby consumers of the other type \u03b8\u00af \u0007= \u03b8. Assume the type \u03b8\u00af con-\nsumers do not receive service. Then for any \u03b4 \u2208 (0,1) there\nexists \u03b1\u00af > 0, such that for all \u03b1\u03b8 \u2208 (0, \u03b1\u00af) the benefit \u000f of a\ntype \u03b8 customer to a firm is greater than M (independent of\nthe service strategies toward type \u03b8 consumers).\nProof.Because the type \u03b8\u00af followers do not receive service, they\nwill search for high-quality firms. The value of next-period type \u03b8\u00af\nSTRATEGIC FIRMS AND CONSUMER EMULATION 655\nfollowers to any firm due to a visit by a leader is at least\n(14) (1 \u2212 \u03b4)\u03b1\u03b8\u00af [1 \u2212 F(u\u03b8\u00af0 \u2212 ql)]2(1 \u2212 \u03bb)\u03b4\n1\n\u03b1\u03b8\nP\u03b2.\nIn every period there will be (1\u2212 \u03b4)\u03b1\u03b8\u00af newborn followers of type \u03b8\u00af\nwho go into the market with probability greater than [1\u2212 F(u\u03b8\u00af0 \u2212\nq)] > 0, do not find a sufficiently good firmwith probability (1\u2212 \u03bb),\nsurvive another period with probability \u03b4, and consume again\nwith probability of at least [1\u2212 F(u\u03b8\u00af0 \u2212 ql)]. This time they follow\na leader who was in themarket the previous period, of whom there\nare at most \u03b1\u03b8 . They pay price P, and because they follow a period\nlater than the visit of the leader, their value is discounted by \u03b2.\nThe expression goes to infinity as \u03b1\u03b8 goes to zero. The firm might\nincur service costs for the leader, but these are easily offset by his\nimmediate type \u03b8\u00af followers. The leader might also have followers\nof his own type, which themselves bring a benefit larger than M in\nthe period after and will therefore increase this consumers benefit\neven more. QED\nThe following lemma shows that a high-quality firm will pro-\nvide service when the customer\u2019s profit contribution is sufficiently\nlarge. Let\u000f\u03b8h denote the benefit of one-time consumption of a type\n\u03b8 consumer for a high-quality firm.\nLEMMA 6. There exists M > 0 such that in any stationary equilib-\nrium with \u000f\u03b8h > M, a high-quality firm will promise service\ns\u00af in any period to type \u03b8 consumers.\nSketch of Proof. We distinguish two cases. Case 1: A type-\u03b8\ncustomer of a high-quality firmwould search for another firm if he\nhad not been promised service in the last period. Then for \u000f\u03b8h >\nM = c promising service is optimal, because by promising service\nthe firm retains the business of this consumer and gains \u000f\u03b8h \u2212 c\nwhen he returns. Case 2: The consumer would return to the firm\neven if he had not been promised service during his last visit.\nThe consumer will enter the market with lower probability than\nif service had been promised. This implies that his next visit will\nbe delayed in expectation. Due to discounting and potential death\nof the consumer, this delay is associated with a loss proportional\nto \u000f\u03b8h. Therefore, for \u000f\u03b8h large enough it is always profitable to\navoid the delay costs by promising service, even though service is\ncostly. A precise proof based on the one-shot-deviation-principle\ncan be found in Kircher and Postlewaite (2007).\n656 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS\nFinally, we show that high-quality firms will always outbid\nlow-quality firms:\nLEMMA 7. Let \u03b4 \u2208 (\u03b4,1). In any stationary equilibrium, either\nsh(\u03b8 ) \u2265 sl(\u03b8 ) for \u03b8 \u2208 {p, w}, or sh(\u03b8 ) < sl(\u03b8 ), but type \u03b8 con-\nsumers nevertheless do not return to low-quality firms.\nProof. Assume sh(\u03b8 ) < sl(\u03b8 ) and type \u03b8 customers stop search-\ning when they have found a low-quality firm. We will discuss the\ncase of the wealthy, that is, \u03b8 = w (note that the discussion holds\nfor the poor when the roles of wealthy and poor are reversed). Be-\ncause the wealthy receive service, they have to have followers. The\npoor would follow them only if the poor also got service from low-\nquality firms and not from high-quality firms, as only then they\nhave an incentive to search for low qualities. (If the poor searched\nfor high qualities, they would not want to follow the wealthy who\nstop searching at low qualities.) Yet if the poor follow the wealthy,\nthe poor will not get any service, because P > c.\nTo get service, wealthy customers must be followed by some-\none, and the only candidates are other wealthy consumers who\nare still searching. If each wealthy consumer is followed by some\nexpected number Nw of other wealthy consumers (and by none of\nthe poor), the candidate equilibrium profit contribution \u000fwl that\na low-quality firm receives from a one-time visit of a wealthy cus-\ntomer is\n\u000fwl = P \u2212 c + \u03b2Nw\u000fwl\n[\n1 + \u03b4\u03b2\n1 \u2212 \u03b4\u03b2 (1 \u2212 F(u\nw\n0 \u2212 ql \u2212 s\u00af))\n]\n+ \u03b2Nwc.\n(15)\nThe derivation is similar to that of equation (13). In the stationary\nsetting\n\u03b2Nw\n[\n1 + \u03b4\u03b2\n1 \u2212 \u03b4\u03b2 (1 \u2212 F(u\nw\n0 \u2212 ql \u2212 s\u00af))\n]\n< 1.\nSolving for \u000fwl yields\n(16) \u000fwl = P \u2212 c + \u03b2Nwc\n1 \u2212 \u03b2Nw\n[\n1 + \u03b4\u03b21\u2212\u03b4\u03b2 [1 \u2212 F(uw0 \u2212 ql \u2212 s\u00af)]\n] .\nFor this to be an equilibrium, \u000fwl \u2265 0. Consider first the case\nwhere\u000fwl > 0, that is, P \u2212 c + \u03b2N\u03b8c > 0. In this case high-quality\nfirms have an incentive to deviate and also offer service to wealthy\nSTRATEGIC FIRMS AND CONSUMER EMULATION 657\nconsumers, which upsets the equilibrium. To see this, note that\nfor a high-quality firm the candidate equilibrium profit contri-\nbution from a wealthy consumer is zero after the first period of\nconsumption because he does not consume there again. Deviating\nand offering service to the customer and all his followers generates\nthe profit contribution\n\u000f\u2032 = P \u2212 c + \u03b2Nw\u000f\u2032\n[\n1 + \u03b4\u03b2\n1 \u2212 \u03b4\u03b2 (1 \u2212 F\n\u2032)\n]\n+ \u03b2Nwc,\nwhere 1 \u2212 F \u2032 is the probability with which a wealthy customer\nthat is offered service is returning. Because \u03c1\u00af > uw0 \u2212 qh \u2212 s\u00af, the\nfrequency 1 \u2212 F \u2032 > 0. Because P \u2212 c + \u03b4Nwc > 0, it follows that\n\u000f\u2032 > 0.35 But then high-quality firms would offer service.\nConsider now the case \u000fwl = 0, that is, P \u2212 c + \u03b2Nwc = 0.\nTherefore, low-quality firms are indifferent between promising\nservice or not. In this case high-quality firms are also indiffer-\nent between offering service or not. By the tie-breaking rule we\nemployed, both types of firms offer service.36 However, wealthy\nconsumers then do not search for low-quality firms; consequently\nhigh-quality firms offer service, and wealthy customers would not\nsearch for low qualities. QED\nThis completes the proof of Proposition 2.\nLEMMA 8. Consider a candidate equilibrium in which type \u03b8 con-\nsumers are followed (only) by other type \u03b8 consumers that\nare still searching. There exists \u03b4\u2217 \u2208 (0,1) such that for \u03b4 > \u03b4\u2217\nno firm would find it profitable to promise service to type \u03b8\nconsumers.\nProof. If \u03b8 = r and high-quality firms would provide service,\nwe get a contradiction by considering equation (13) with the num-\nber of poor followers Np = 0 and Nw = 1 \u2212 \u03b3, where \u03b3 is the\n35. Since this is a deviation from a steady state,\n\u03b2Nw\u000f\u2032\n[\n1 + \u03b4\u03b2\n1 \u2212 \u03b4\u03b2 (1 \u2212 F\n\u2032)\n]\nmight be larger than 1, in which case the discounted profit from offering service\nis unbounded.\n36. This is the only place we use this tie-breaking rule. The result holds also\nwhen we employ the assumption that firms do not offer service when indifferent.\nThe point is that both types of firms resolve indifference the same way. Moreover,\nsimple restrictions such as a high survival rate \u03b4, a high cost\u2013price wedge c \u2212 P,\nor a modest service influence s\u00af would also guarantee the result, as they rule out\nindifference.\n658 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS\nfixed point to equation (11). Because 1 \u2212 \u03b3 converges to 1 and\n(1 \u2212 \u03b3 )\/(1 \u2212 \u03b4) to 1\/(1 \u2212 F(uw0 \u2212 qh \u2212 s\u00af)) for \u03b4 converging to 1, the\nper-period profit including followers is \u000f \u2248 (P \u2212 c) < 0 for \u03b4 large.\nThis contradicts a profit-maximizing service offer by high-quality\nfirms. An analogous argument establishes that if high-quality\nfirms do not offer service, a high-quality firm that offers service\nwould make a loss. Similarly, we can show that low-quality firms\nwouldmake a loss if they offered service, and extend the argument\nto \u03b8 = w.37 QED\nProof of Proposition 3. By Proposition 2, high-quality firms\nprovide weakly higher service than do low-quality firms. There-\nfore, all consumers search for high-quality firms (see Lemma 2).\nThat is, all consumers, wealthy and poor, will in equilibrium fol-\nlow the distribution that places the highest weight on high-quality\nfirms. By Proposition 1, s\u00af < \u03bd\u02c6\u03b3 ensures that all consumers will\nfollow the wealthy, even if the poor receive the service. Because\nP < c, service is only provided (i.e., promised and then delivered)\nto players who have followers. Therefore, in equilibrium only the\nwealthy can receive service. Although \u03bd\u02c6\u03b3 depends on \u03b3, one can\nshow that it is bounded away from up0 \u2212 uw0 for all \u03b3 \u2265 \u03bb. QED\nProof of Proposition 4. Assume all players follow the wealthy\nwhen searching. Then the poor will never be promised service by\nany firm that expects repeat business, because P < c and the firm\nwould make a loss by doing so. The wealthy will be promised ser-\nvice by all high-quality firms.These firms can induce the consumer\nto return by offering service. For \u03b1\u2217 small enough, Proposition 2\nestablishes that this will be the only choice that does not have\na profitable deviation. Because high-quality firms offer service,\nlow-quality firms are never repeatedly visited by a wealthy player\n(see Lemma 2). It is immediate that all players have an incen-\ntive to follow the wealthy: because sh(w) \u2265 sh(p), by Proposition 1\n\u03b3 w > \u03b3 p > \u03bb, and following the wealthy is better than following\nthe poor or sampling randomly.\nFor s\u00af < \u03bd no other equilibria exist, as by Proposition 3 all\nplayers follow the wealthy and the assumption of the prior para-\ngraph is fulfilled. If \u03b4 > \u03b4\u2217, it is not profitable to provide service\nto the poor if they are followed only by other poor consumers. If\n\u03b1\u2217 is sufficiently small, then each poor consumer can only have\n37. The argument remains valid even when \u03b2 = \u03b4, that is, the firms\u2019 discount\nfactor is also large.\nSTRATEGIC FIRMS AND CONSUMER EMULATION 659\na negligible number of wealthy followers, and providing service\nto the poor remains unprofitable even if all consumers follow\nthe poor. If the poor do not receive service, they prefer to follow\nthe wealthy, and again the assumption of the prior paragraph is\nfulfilled. QED\nProof of Proposition 5. Assume all consumers follow the\nwealthy. Because \u03b4 > \u03b4\u2217, the wealthy do not receive service due\nto wealthy followers, and \u03b1\u2217\u2217 small enough assures there will not\nbe sufficient poor followers to warrant service.38 Also, the poor do\nnot get service. Proposition 1 then establishes \u03b3 w > \u03b3 p > \u03bb, and\neverybody follows the poor. By Proposition 3, for s\u00af < \u03bd there can-\nnot be any other stationary equilibria in which the wealthy are\nnot being followed.\nConsider a stationary equilibrium in which the poor do not\nfollow the wealthy. It must then be the case that the wealthy\nfollow the poor. If the wealthy did not follow the poor, the poor\nwould not receive service, and everybody would follow the wealthy\nas in the previous paragraph. If the wealthy follow the poor, then\nby Lemma 2 high-quality firms would indeed want to provide\nservice to the poor. Yet the wealthy will only follow the poor if\n\u03b3 p \u2265 \u03b3 w. By Proposition 3 this only happens for s\u00af \u2265 \u03bd\u02c6\u03b3 p. Because\n\u03b3 p is bounded away from one for all s\u00af because some newborns are\nalways searching, it is easy to see that \u03bd\u02c6\u03b3 p is bounded. Therefore\nthere exists \u03bd \u2032 such that s\u00af \u2265 \u03bd \u2032 implies \u03b3 p \u2265 \u03b3 w.
