Introduction\nThere are many materials for which the surface topography is a crucial\ncharacteristic. There are too many examples to list comprehensively, but a\nfew instances serve to illustrate the range of materials and applications. One\nsuch is the work in [1] on surface geometry, wettability, roughness and other\nproperties of composite polylactic acid and calcium phosphate glass sca\ufb00olds\nwith a biological application. Another example whereby 3D shape charac-\nterization has been employed [2] involves a lunar soil simulant material with\nthe aim of using the resulting shapes in a series of flow particle simulations.\nSome other examples include shape characterization of cement particles [3],\ncharacterization of ZnO [4], shape characterization of sol-gel zinc silicate glass\nparticles [5] and large defects in alumina ceramics [6].\nThe above examples illustrate the relevance of shape characterization of\nparticles or surfaces of a given material. However, shape characterization\nis also useful to describe or quantify the overall properties of manufactured\nparts such as the ones obtained through micromoulding.\nMicromoulding refers to the mass production process through which devices\nwith micro and nano scale surface features are manufactured [7] (the overall\nsize of the components analyzed in this work is in the order of microns with\nnanometric surface features). This has become steadily more important over\nthe past 30 years, when it was forecasted as one of the main manufactur-\ning technologies of the 21st century [8]. Its current relevance is mainly a\nbyproduct of the constant development of portable electronic devices. This\nindustry also manufactures devices for micro-optics, and life sciences applic-\nations. Most of the devices produced by this process are made of polymeric\nmaterials since this type of material o\ufb00ers the possibility of being tailored to\nthe specific needs of a given application [8].\nMicromoulding is a\ufb00ected by a number of variables such as the injection\nrate at which the moulding cavity is filled, injection and holding pressures,\nmould and melt temperature and cooling time [9]. Small variations in such\nvariables may lead to a significant change in the shape and properties of the\nfinal product. Extensive research has been carried out on the influence that\n2\nthese variables have on the final shape of the end product. These include\nstudies on flow visualisation in micromoulding for determining cooling rates\nwithin the mould and research on the mechanical properties of micro compon-\nents using Atomic Force Microscopy [10, 11, 12, 13]. Uncontrolled changes on\nthe shape and properties of the component are clearly unwanted and quality\ncontrol methods must be implemented. However, quality assessment tech-\nniques previously available, often applied to larger scale components, cannot\no\ufb00er the precision required to verify the quality of micromoulded compon-\nents. Given that the product\u2019s functionality is directly related to its surface\ngeometry, techniques that quantify the surface directly are desirable for the\ncontrol of quality.\nResearch on product property measurement has been carried out and has\nbeen used to determine dimensional properties, consequently allowing for full\nthree-dimensional assessments. Among the techniques readily available are:\n\u2022 White Light Interferometry (WLI). This is a non-contact 3D surface\nmeasurement technique with an associated accuracy of fractions of a\nmicron and is combined with an optical setup for visualizing structures\nat microscopic scales. It is set up in such a way that the height of a\ngiven two-dimensional point is determined by the relation between the\npath lengths of two di\ufb00erent beams.\n\u2022 Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). The resolutions obtained with this\ntechnique are equivalent to fractions of a nanometer. The information\nis gathered via a probe with a very sharp nanometre sized tip and a\nsensitive piezoelectric actuator so that accurate small-scale scanning\ncan be obtained. Its advantage over electron microscopy is that it\nprovides a true three-dimensional profile, and that the instruments can\nperform in ambient conditions and even in liquids. [14], [13].\n\u2022 Nanoindenting. This technique is so flexible that can be applied to\ndi\ufb00erent materials ranging from metals and plastics and in forms vary-\ning from thin films to powders [15]. A nanometre scale diamond tip is\ndriven into the material surface with displacement and load monitored.\n\u2022 Extensive Depth Of Field. The traditional optics concept of extensive\ndepth of field has been applied within micromoulding as a technique for\nobtaining three-dimensional profiles by recording a number of images\nat di\ufb00erent depths transversally to the focus plane. Then, the set of\n3\nimages is processed so that a fully focused three-dimensional represent-\nation of the component is obtained [16].\n\u2022 Utrasonic techniques, which combine the use of ultrasound and an op-\ntical laser to determine the dimensions of a given cavity [17].\nIn summary, surface measurement techniques employed for characteriz-\ning micro and nano scale surface features nowadays are generally associated\nwith massive amounts of data in the form of three-dimensional point clouds.\nManagement of these data is di\ufb03cult in practice. Thus, a surface charac-\nterization technique capable of describing the surface geometry accurately\nwhilst compressing the data set would be ideal.\nThis work proposes the use of Partial Di\ufb00erential Equations (PDEs) as\nmeans of obtaining a surface representation of a given micromoulded com-\nponent semi-automatically. PDEs have been previously used as a surface\ngeneration technique to produce parametric surfaces in other generally larger\nscale applications and computer-aided design [18] and recently these authors\nhave introduced PDEs as a surface generation technique for surface profiling\nof micro-scale structures [19]. Surfaces arising from PDEs are the graphic\nrepresentation of the solution to a given PDE subject to a specific set of\nboundary conditions, translating surface characterization into a boundary-\nvalue problem. The boundary conditions describing outer contours of the\nsurface are extracted from experimental point clouds. Periodic boundary\nconditions are used to ensure that analytic solutions can be found. Relevant\ndesign parameters are then expressed as functions of the coe\ufb03cients describ-\ning the analytic solution to the Biharmonic equation, which can then be\ncompared against the design values.\nThe proposed technique is graphically illustrated in Figure 1. This Figure\nshows a graphic representation of the overall process highlighting the most\nimportant steps associated with this technique. First, a component obtained\nthrough a micromoulding machine by filling a given mould is shown (Fig-\nure 1.a). Secondly, three-dimensional data representing the entire surface\nprofile of such a component is obtained through WLI (Figure 1.b); this data\nbeing in the form of a point cloud. Thirdly, the profile is subdivided into\nregions representing each of the surface features that characterize the surface\nprofile (Figure 1.c). Afterwards, a set of boundary curves are extracted from\nevery subregion (Figure 1.d) and lastly, a PDE-based surface representation\nof each surface feature is obtained, followed by some quantitative analyses so\nthat the the quality of the component can be determined (Figure 1.e).\n4\n(a) (b) (c) (d) (e)\nFigure 1: Schematic representation of the surface characterization process proposed in this\nwork. The stages illustrated here start at the production of micromoulded components\n(a) followed by the extraction of three-dimensional data (b). These data are analyzed\nso that they are divided into regions representing each surface feature (c). Then, a set\nof boundary curves representing the surface profile of the feature is obtained (d) and the\nprocess finishes with the generation of a PDE surface representation of each surface feature\nwithin a given component (e).\nThus, a quality assessment method based on this comparison may be\neventually incorporated into the production process. Moreover, this tech-\nnique also allows the characterization of surface profiles with random or high\nfrequency features and such a chracterization may prove useful for the study\nof some physical properties of such surfaces.\nNote that the technique developed here is intended to compress the data\ncontained in massive point clouds whilst finding an analytic expression for\ncharacterizing surface features. Also, it is worth highlighting the aim of the\nquality assessment method based on the use of this technique. This would be\nto provide an improved procedure for determining if the surface profile of the\nresulting manufactured micromoulded components is a su\ufb03ciently accurate\nrepresentation of that originally intended.\nThis paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the mathematical\nfoundations of the Biharmonic equation as a surface generation technique to-\ngether with some graphical examples. This section also outlines the di\ufb00erent\ncurve extraction techniques employed throughout this work for characteriz-\ning micromoulding surface features. Section 3 provides several mathematical\nexpressions relating relevant geometry parameters to the analytic solution to\nthe Biharmonic equation for a particular surface feature. Section 4 presents\nthe results obtained for di\ufb00erent types of data sets representing a variety\nof micromoulding surface profiles and includes the analysis of di\ufb00erent data\nsets representing the same surface profile as a prerequisite for generating an\nin-line quality assessment technique. Section 5 outlines the conclusions and\n5\nfurther directions of this work.\n2. Solution of the Biharmonic equation as a surface generation\ntechnique\nThe use of elliptic PDEs as a surface generation technique was firstly\napplied to the area of computer aided geometric design as a technique suit-\nable for blending surfaces [20]. However, the areas of application of such\ntechniques have increased and include automatic design optimisation and\ninteractive design [21] together with applications to physical and biological\nsystems. The technique proposed here is based on the use of the Biharmonic\nequation as a surface generation technique, which has proved successful in\nComputer Aided Design (CAD) systems for representing complex shapes\n[21]. This is mainly due to the fact that it intrinsically o\ufb00ers tangential (C1)\ncontinuity on every point of the resulting surface. Note that in order to guar-\nantee curvature (C2) continuity a sixth order elliptic PDE would be required\nand its solution can be found in a similar manner as the one used in this\nwork.\nThe Biharmonic equation is an elliptic PDE often encountered in discip-\nlines such as fluid and solid mechanics. This equation has been associated\nwith suitable mathematical models for phenomena such as Stokes\u2019 flows,\nplane stress and plain strain problems in di\ufb00erent geometries. Given the im-\nportance of this equation, several approaches have been undertaken to find its\nsolution according to the nature of each specific problem. These techniques\nvary from pure analytic approaches to fully numerical techniques. This work\nuses an analytic solution that is valid when using periodic boundary condi-\ntions and is outlined below.\nNevertheless, it is important to stress that PDEs of di\ufb00erent kinds and\norder may be used to generate surfaces. For instance, the work presented in\n[22] uses a sixth order elliptic PDE aiming to develop a fast surface modelling\ntechnique.\n2.1. Analytic solution to the Biharmonic Equation\nSurfaces arising from PDEs are often referred as PDE surfaces and in this\nwork are defined as the graphic representation to the solution to the Bihar-\nmonic Equation over a two-dimensional parametric domain. The Biharmonic\n6\nequation is given by \uffff \u22022\n\u2202u2\n+\n\u22022\n\u2202v2\n\uffff2\nX(u, v) = 0 , (1)\nwhere u and v are the parametric surface coordinates, which are then mapped\ninto the physical space through X(u, v) : R2 \u2192 R3; i. e.,\nX(u, v) = (x(u, v), y(u, v), z(u, v)).\nA closed form analytic solution to Equation (1) in the form of a pseudo-\nspectral method can be found when restricting the boundary conditions to\nperiodic ones and the parametric domain to 0 \u2264 u \u2264 1 and 0 \u2264 v \u2264 2\u03c0.\nThus, the particular solution to Equation (1) is found by specifying a set\nof four boundary conditions that define the value of X(u, v) and some of its\nderivatives at the boundary of the parametric domain. Note that due to the\nuse of boundary conditions periodic in v, only four boundary conditions are\nrequired. Thus, the use of the Biharmonic equation as a surface generation\ntechnique requires two positional boundary conditions and their respective\nnormal derivatives (in this particular case, the normal derivatives are equal\nto the derivatives with respect to u) at each respective edge of the domain.\nFor this particular technique and given that the boundary curves that\nare obtained from a given point cloud represent are positional boundary\ncurves, the required derivative boundary conditions are found using standard\nfinite di\ufb00erences techniques. That is, the positional boundary conditions\nare defined by the outermost curves at each respective edge of the surface\npatch and the inner ones are used to compute the corresponding derivative\naccordingly.\nThe solution is found using the method of separation of variables [23] and\nis given by,\nX(u, v) = A0(u) +\n\u221e\uffff\nn=1\n[An(u) cos(nv) +Bn(u) sin(nv)] , (2)\nwhere the vector-value polynomials A0(u), An(u) and Bn(u) are determined\nby\nA0(u) = a00 + a01u+ a02u\n2 + a03u\n3 , (3)\nAn(u) = (an1 + an3u) e\nanu + (an2 + an4u) e\n\u2212anu , (4)\nBn(u) = (bn1 + bn3u) e\nanu + (bn2 + bn4u) e\n\u2212anu . (5)\n7\nThe value of the constant vectors aij and bij are determined by the specified\nboundary conditions, which, for this purpose, have to be expressed in terms\nof a Fourier series. Each of the components of these vectors corresponds to\na direction in the Cartesian three-dimensional space.\nGiven that the general solution to the Biharmonic equation is expressed\nin terms of an infinite series, this solution needs to be approximated by a\nfinite one whereby the first N terms of the sum are included together with\nthe introduction of a remainder term. The approximation is given by,\nX(u, v) = A0(u) +\nN\uffff\nn=1\n[An cos(nv) +Bn sin(nv)] +R(u, v) , (6)\nwhere R(u, v) is a function defined as,\nR(u, v) = r1(v)e\nwu + r2(v)e\n\u2212wu + r3(v)uewu + r4(v)ue\u2212wu . (7)\nThe value of w has been conveniently chosen as w = a(N + 1) and, r1(v),\nr2(v), r3(v) and r4(v) are vector-valued functions denoting the di\ufb00erence\nbetween the original boundary conditions and the ones satisfied by,\nF(u, v) = A0(u) +\nN\uffff\nn=1\n[An cos(nv) +Bn sin(nv)] . (8)\nTherefore, Equation (7) is responsible for exactly satisfying the original\nboundary conditions when using Equation (6). Note that in some partic-\nular cases all the original boundary conditions could be expressed in terms\nof finite Fourier series and, in such cases, the remainder term is not required.\nSurface representations of objects with relatively simple topologies can be\ndescribed using a single set of four boundary conditions. However, objects\nwith more complex topologies often require more than one set of bound-\nary conditions, leading to PDE-based surfaces composed of several surface\npatches. Each of these patches results from a solution to Equation 1 corres-\nponding to its respective set of boundary conditions. Surface continuity is\nobtained by imposing common boundary conditions at the required region.\nExamples of the di\ufb00erent surface representations obtained using the Bi-\nharmonic equation are shown in Figure 2. The boundary curves used to solve\nthe boundary-value problem are shown at the left of each respective surface.\nThese examples correspond to some of the surface features that have been\nanalyzed in this work.\n8\nFigure 2: PDE-based surface representations of various objects. The boundary curves are\noutlined at the left whereas the corresponding PDE surface is shown at the right in each\ncase.\nBoth; the boundary-value approach o\ufb00ered by the Biharmonic equation\nas a surface generation technique together with the parametric nature of the\nsolution to this equation are ideal for compressing information stored in the\nform of massive point clouds such as the ones obtained. Therefore, PDE-\nbased surface representations of micromoulding features may be obtained.\nFurthermore, key geometry parameters pertaining to a given surface feature\ncan be expressed in terms of the coe\ufb03cients associated with the particular\nsolution to equation 6. Then, the values obtained by these expressions can\nbe compared against the values originally assigned to the mould\u2019s geometry\nparameters, giving rise to a mechanism for determining the quality of all the\ncomponents produced by the same mould.\nThus, in order to characterize micromoulding surface features using the\nBiharmonic equation, the appropriate number of boundary curves must be\nchosen. These curves are extracted from a point cloud as faithfully as possible\nso that they can describe the outer contour of the feature. This work em-\nploys two di\ufb00erent curve extraction techniques. One is based upon a feature\noriented approach whilst the other is aimed for representing full surface pro-\nfiles. Naturally, the approach is selected according to each problem. Details\non such techniques are given below.\n2.2. Curve extraction procedure\nThe use of the Biharmonic equation as a surface characterization method\nfor micromoulded surfaces is capable of drastically reducing the size of the\ndata whilst maintaining crucial information associated with a surface profile\nof the corresponding component. To that end, boundary curves outlining the\nmost important or prominent features must be extracted from the original\ndata set. This results in adopting fairly straightforward procedures. One of\n9\nthese curve extraction procedures is aimed at preserving the features observed\nand thus, the entire profile is divided into regions, the limits of which are\nbased on the design of the mould.\nBy contrast, some of the profiles found in micromoulding are not directly\nassociated with the component design. They may be characteristic of the\nprocess (e.g. extrusion) or the material. These profiles are particularly inter-\nesting since characterizing them may prove useful in understanding physical\nphenomena occurring during the process. For instance, surface profiles result-\ning from polymer blends present shapes often with random protuberances,\nwhich represent interface regions between the component materials. This\ntype of surface profile requires a di\ufb00erent curve extraction approach.\nTo that end, two di\ufb00erent curve extraction techniques are used through-\nout this work. The first consists of extracting contours outlining a particular\nsurface feature. This technique is particularly useful for feature-oriented ana-\nlysis. Here, the subregions within the point cloud representing a given feature\nare further divided into subregions representing slices or transversal subre-\ngions. The extraction process consists of identifying the closest points to a\npre-defined template (subject to a tolerance value that is adjusted manually).\nThe final boundary curves are then found by averaging the position of the\nidentified points within the area to which they belong according to the pre-\nestablished template. The second curve extraction approach used throughout\nthis work is based on representing the entire profile of a micromoulding com-\nponent. Here, a number of transversal curves are obtained from the point\ncloud. Note that in order to satisfy the periodicity condition inherent to the\nspecific analytic solution to the Biharmonic equation in use through out this\nwork, the transversal curves must be closed.\nIn summary, the boundary curves required to find a PDE-based repres-\nentation of the surface profiles analyzed in this work were extracted either by\nusing a pre-determined template outlining the contour of a specific feature or\nby extracting transversal curves at specified positions along the surface. It is\nworth noting that some of these curves are used to determine the derivative\nboundary conditions by using finite di\ufb00erences.\nExamples of the two di\ufb00erent curve extraction approaches are shown in\nFigure 3. The left hand side of the Figure show the boundary curves associ-\nated with features found in a typical silicon-made calibrating grid (Figure 3.a)\nwhereas the right hand side shows transversal curves extracted from the pro-\nfile of a 30 nm thick layer of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide), on a Sylgard (TM)\nsilicone elastomer substrate (Figure 3.b).\n10\n(a) (b)\nFigure 3: Curve extraction techniques. Feature oriented approach (a) and transversal set\nof curves (b).\n3. Design parameter characterization as a function of the solution\nto the Biharmonic equation\nTypically the surface topography of the component will correspond to a\nparticular design, but will replicate it imperfectly. The design from where mi-\ncromoulded components are obtained is intrinsically associated with a num-\nber of parameters (geometry parameters henceforth), which are specified so\nthat the particular engineering requirements of a given mould are met. For\ninstance, a component presenting a cylindrical surface feature is associated\nwith two geometry parameters: radius and height of the cylinder. Therefore,\na methodology for determining the experimental values of such parameters\nis highly desirable. On the other hand, the coe\ufb03cients associated with the\nanalytic solution to the Biharmonic equation given in Equation 6 are in their\nown right a di\ufb00erent set of parameters representing the shape of the surface\nof each particular feature.\nThus, a mechanism for measuring the value of the geometry parameters\nfor the micromoulded components can be implemented. The experimental\nvalue of the geometry parameters found as a byproduct of the coe\ufb03cients\n(PDE coe\ufb03cients henceforth) involved in Equation 6 can be then compared\nagainst the mould design values themselves. To that end, expressions relating\ngeometry parameters to the PDE coe\ufb03cients must be found.\nIt is important to stress that closed surface representations are obtained\nby solving at least three PDEs, each of which is subject to a di\ufb00erent set of\nboundary conditions; however, the boundary conditions are chosen so that\nC0 continuity is guaranteed. Two of these PDEs are responsible for closing\n11\nthe surface; that is, the overall shape of the surface representing the feature\nhas no holes and consequently, the volume enclosed by the surface can be\ncomputed numerically. Thus, a minimum of three di\ufb00erent sets of PDE\ncoe\ufb03cients are available for characterizing geometry parameters defining a\nsurface feature. Let the set of solutions associated with a given surface feature\nbe represented by\n\u03c7[i](u, v) = A0[i](u) +\nn=N\uffff\nn=1\n[An[i](u) cos(nv) + Bn[i](u) cos(nv)] . (9)\nwhere i = 1, . . . , k represent the corresponding surface patch. Table 1 shows\nthe formulae relating some of the most relevant geometry parameters to the\nPDE coe\ufb03cients according to a particular surface feature.\nNote that the features and their respective geometry parameters in Table 1\nare examples, which have been chosen for illustration purposes and do not\nrepresent a limit on the potential of the Biharmonic equation for character-\nizing surface features.\n3.1. Standard quality criterion\nSo far, the criteria used to determine the quality of manufactured mi-\ncromoulding components consist of imposing a threshold to some geometry\nparameters. The components are regarded as good if the component meets\nthe pre-established threshold, otherwise the component is then regarded as\nfaulty. However, the methods for evaluating such geometry parameters dur-\ning the in-line production process are crude. The same type of criteria is used\nin this work, with the di\ufb00erence that the value of the geometry parameter\nwith a pre-established threshold is found through an expression depending\nupon the PDE coe\ufb03cients. Thus, a more robust method involving the com-\nplete area of interest for that particular parameter is included.\n4. Results\nThe technique developed here has been tested using experimental data\narising from both WLI and AFM. The only di\ufb00erence this makes to the\nproposed technique lies with the way in which the data is pre-processed so\nthat the curve extraction procedure can take place.\n12\nTable 1: Characterization of relevant geometry parameters in terms of PDE coe\ufb03cients\naccording to di\ufb00erent shapes of possible surface features.\nFeature shape Geometry parameters Expression relating geometry\nparameters to PDE coe\ufb03cients\nCircular cylindrical surface base radius, r r = \uffffA1[2](0)\u2212 A0[2](0)\uffff\nheight, h h = \uffffA0[2](1)\u2212 A0[2](0)\uffff\nElliptic cylindrical surface major base radius, a a = \uffffA1[2](0)\u2212 A0[2](0)\uffff\nminor base radius, b b = \uffffB1[2](0)\u2212 A0[2](0)\uffff\nheight, h h = \uffffA0[2](1)\u2212 A0[2](0)\uffff\nQuadrilateral prism side a a = 2\uffff\u03c7[2](0, \u03c02 )\u2212 \u03c7[2](0, 0)\uffff\nside, b b = 2\uffff\u03c7[2](0, \u03c0)\u2212 \u03c7[2](0, \u03c02 )\uffff\nheight, h h = \uffffA0[2](1)\u2212 A0[2](0)\uffff\nConical cylindrical surface base radius, a a = \uffffA1[2](0)\u2212 A0[2](0)\uffff\n(circular) top radius, b b = \uffffA1[2](1)\u2212 A0[2](1)\uffff\nheight, h h = \uffffA0[2](1)\u2212 A0[2](0)\uffff\nConical cylindrical surface base major radius, a1 a1 = \uffffA1[2](0)\u2212 A0[2](0)\uffff\n(elliptical) base minor radius, b1 b1 = \uffffB1[2](0)\u2212 A0[2](0)\uffff\ntop major radius, a2 a2 = \uffffA1[2](1)\u2212 A0[2](1)\uffff\ntop minor radius, b2 b2 = \uffffB1[2](1)\u2212 A0[2](1)\uffff\nheight, h h = \uffffA0[2](1)\u2212 A0[2](0)\uffff\nParabolic nose cone major semi-axis, a a = \uffffA1[2](0)\u2212 A0[2](0)\uffff\nminor semi-axis, b b = \uffffB1[2](0)\u2212 A0[2](0)\uffff\nheight, h h = \uffffA0[2](1)\u2212 A0[2](0)\uffff\nCollection of n concentric base radii, ri, i =, . . . , n ri = \uffffA1[2i](0)\u2212 A0[2i](0)\uffff\ncircular cylinders height, h hi = \uffffA0[2i](1)\u2212 A0[2i](0)\uffff\n13\nFor instance, the data obtained through AFM is originally collected in a\ntwo-dimensional format. The resulting two-dimensional image is analysed so\nthat the light intensity of each pixel is transformed into the height associ-\nated with the coordinates of that particular pixel. Thus, three-dimensional\ninformation representing the overall surface profile of a given component is\ngenerated.\nBy contrast, experimental data obtained using WLI is already in three-\ndimensional form. However, these data sets may contain some points for\nwhich no reading of its corresponding height could be recorded. To that end,\nfaulty points are removed form the data set.\nAfter either converting the data into a three-dimensional point cloud or\nremoving incomplete information, a suitable curve extraction process is em-\nployed according to the approach needed for characterizing each particular\nprofile.\n4.1. AFM experimental data\nDi\ufb00erent AFM data sets representing various micromoulding compon-\nents have been analysed. Two of these data sets correspond to a silicon\ncalibrating grid and a third one is associated with a 30 nm thick layer of\npoly(N-isopropylacrylamide), on a Sylgard (TM) silicone elastomer substrate\n(PNIPA surface henceforth). Figure 4 shows the two-dimensional image of\nthe three data sets corresponding to the silicon calibrating grid at two dif-\nferent magnifications (Figure 4.a and Figure 4.b) and to the PNIPA surface\n(Figure 4.c) respectively . Note that the first data set representing the cal-\nibrating grid comprising 90 complete surface features whilst the second one\ncontains four complete surface features.\nThe full three-dimensional representation of these data sets is shown in\nFigure 5. These boundary curves associated with each data set have been\nextracted accordingly. Thus, the data sets pertaining to the calibrating grid\nhave been processed using the feature-based approach whilst the bound-\nary curves associated with the PNIPA surface have been obtained using the\nprofile-oriented method. Each of the features in these data sets has been\nrepresented using 10 boundary curves. This enables us to obtain closed\nPDE-based surface representations of each feature and allow to compute its\nvolume. The boundary curves extracted for the data sets representing the\ncalibrating grid together with the corresponding PDE-based surface repres-\nentations are presented in Figure 6.\n14\n\u2732\u271b \u2732\u271b \u2732\u271b\n104.9 \u00b5m 29.2\u00b5m 500 nm\n(a) (b) (c)\nFigure 4: Experimental data obtained using Atomic Force Microscopy. Two sets corres-\nponds to a silicon calibrating grid( (a) and (b)), whereas the third represents an PNIPA\nsurface surface (c).\nFigure 5: Three-dimensional representation of the complete data sets representing a cal-\nibrating grid and the surface profile of a PNIPA surface accordingly.\nThen, once the boundary curves are extracted, the corresponding PDEs\nare solved, leading to a set of coe\ufb03cients for each PDE being found and\nalso the PDE-based surface representation of the corresponding surface fea-\nture being obtained. Thus, the geometry parameters associated with these\nfeatures have been found using the respective PDE coe\ufb03cients and the cor-\nresponding formulae as described in Table 1 for quadrangular prisms. The\naverage length of the side and the height found after analysing the data set\ncomprising 90 surface features have been found to be equal to 4.82 \u00b5m for\nthe side length whereas the height presented a value of 345.79 nm. By con-\ntrast, the values for the same design parameters after analysing the data\n15\nFigure 6: Boundary curves and the corresponding PDE-based surface representation of\nsurface features present in a calibrating grid. Two di\ufb00erent data sets at di\ufb00erent scales\nare shown.\nFigure 7: Boundary curves extracted form a data set representing the surface profile of a\nPNIPA surface. The resulting PDE-surface representation is shown at the right.\nset describing four complete surface features were found equal to 5.086 \u00b5m\nand 348.05 nm respectively. The two data sets represent the same surface\nfeatures at di\ufb00erent scales, the average values closer to the ones with which\nthe calibrating grid was designed (a side length equal to 5\u00b5m and a height\nequivalent to 350 nm) are those obtained from the data set portraying four\nsurface features. This can be attributed to the gain in pixel resolution with\nmagnification.\nBy contrast, the boundary curves required for obtaining a PDE-based\nsurface representation of the surface profile of PNIPA surface have been ex-\ntracted so that the entire profile is described. This helps to preserve the\noriginal nature of such a profile. Thus, a total of 31 curves have been extrac-\nted equidistantly along the profile. These curves give rise to a PDE-based\nsurface representation composed of a total of 10 PDEs. Figure 7 presents\nthe generating boundary curves and the corresponding PDE-based surface\nrepresentation.\nGiven that no geometry parameters are associated with surface profiles\narising from this type of surfaces, di\ufb00erent properties can be used to charac-\nterize the profile. Thus, in the interest of taking advantage of the dependency\n16\nbetween the surface\u2019s functionality and the surface area, PDE-based surface\nrepresentations of such profiles may be used to compute their surface area.\nThe surface area of the profile used here has been found using numerical tech-\nniques and has been found equal to 6.07 x 108 [nm2]. Therefore, PDE-based\nsurface representations have proven to be useful for characterizing important\nphysical properties of complex profiles by providing a mechanism for quan-\ntifying their surface area in a fast and accurate manner. Moreover, these\nPDE-based surface representations of this type of profile may provide excel-\nlent means for multi-scale analyses of more complex surface profiles.\n4.2. WLI experimental data\nData obtained using WLI have also been characterized using PDE sur-\nfaces. The data sets analyzed here consist of six di\ufb00erent samples repres-\nenting di\ufb00erent components obtained using the same mould. A picture of\none of the components is presented in Figure 1.a. This component has been\nmanufactured using Bayer Makrolon LED 2045 polycarbonate with 1 wt%\nmulti-wall carbon nanotubes and consists of 23 circular cylindrical surface\nfeatures with nominally uniform height and the nominally equal base and top\nradii. Faulty points present within the raw-data obtained through WLI were\nremoved from each data set and profiles similar to the one presented in Fig-\nure 1.b were obtained. Note that each of these three-dimensional profiles is\ncomposed of more than half a million points and consequently a PDE-based\ncharacterization of the entire profile using a small portion of these data is\nideal.\nA feature-oriented curve extraction approach has been adopted for ob-\ntaining the necessary boundary curves for generating a closed PDE surface\nrepresentation of each of the features in each data set. To that end, a semi-\nautomatic procedure has been implemented. The first stage of that procedure\nconsists of sectioning the full data set so that each section contains enough\ninformation so that each feature can be characterized. Then, the correspond-\ning boundary curves are generated according to the type of surface that is\nrequired; that is, open or closed. An example of shown region is illustrated\nby Figure 1.c whilst the set of boundary curves found for that features are\nshown in Figure 1.d.\nFigure 8 presents all the boundary curves for all of the cylindrical surface\nfeatures present within each data set. The resulting PDE-based surface rep-\nresentations of each of the components are presented in Figure 9 accordingly.\nClosed surface representations for each of the features have been produced\n17\nhere so that the surface area and volume associated with each feature can\nbe computed. By simple inspection, it can be noticed that one surface fea-\nture in the sixth data set presents a height significantly smaller than that of\nthe rest of the surface features. The formulae describing the geometry para-\nmeters associated with these surface features in terms of PDE coe\ufb03cients\nare given in Table 1. The average value for the base and top radii together\nwith the average height of the features present in each data set are then\nfound. Additionally, average values for surface area and volume have been\nestimated.\nFigure 8: Boundary curves representing each of the cylindrical surface features of di\ufb00erent\ncomponents obtained from the same mould.\nTable 2 presents the average radii and height found for each data set.\nThese were obtained by using the PDE coe\ufb03cients representing each surface\nfeature. Additionally, the average total surface area associated with each data\nset is listed in this Table. The design values assigned to the base and top radii\nare 300 \u00b5m and 225 \u00b5m respectively. It is noticed that the base radii have\nbeen overestimated whereas the top radii have been underestimated. This\ntendency can be explained by the fact that boundary conditions represent\nouter contours delimiting the surface feature. Thus, given the nature of the\n18\nFigure 9: Resulting PDE-Based surfaces of all the cylindrical surface features present with\neach of the components.\nprofile, it can be seen that the curve representing the base radius of each\nsurface feature is found by averaging a set of points approaching it from the\nouter limit of the feature. By contrast, the boundary curve associated with\nthe top radius is found by averaging a set of points delimiting the top radius\nof each feature from the inner limit.\nThe design value assigned to the height of the surface features is 600\nnm. Again, the average height of the surface features found for each sample\npresents a slight underestimation of approximately 25 nm. However, this un-\nderestimation is within the standard tolerance value. The criterion used to\ndetermine the quality of these components involves establishing a threshold\nvalue for the height. Thus, the height of each surface feature within a com-\nponent is compared against the threshold value (550 nm) and if one of the\nsurface features does not meet this requirement, the component is regarded\nas faulty. The six samples analysed throughout this work have been subject\nto this procedure and it has been found that one of the features in the sixth\ndata set presented a considerably smaller height (225 nm) than the threshold.\nTherefore, the component associated with this data set must be regarded as\n19\nfaulty.\nTable 2: Average design values obtained using the PDE-based representation of the surface\nfeatures present within each data set.

Conclusions\nParametric representations of micro and nano scale surface features have\nbeen obtained using PDEs. This characterization has taken place using the\nBiharmonic equation as a surface generation technique, which can be solved\nanalytically when its boundary conditions are restricted to periodic ones.\nThis enables us to significantly reduce the size of data sets generally asso-\nciated with micromoulding since relevant features within a given profile can\nbe represented by a relatively small set of boundary conditions. The coef-\nficients associated with the particular analytic solution of the Biharmonic\nequation for a given surface profile have proven useful for characterizing geo-\nmetry parameters of surface features present within a given component as a\nfunction of either some of the coe\ufb03cients or the full solution itself. Experi-\nmental data obtained by using di\ufb00erent techniques, namely AFM and WLI,\nhave been analysed in order to show that the PDE-based surface generation\ntechnique proposed here can be applied indiscriminately once the data is in\nthree-dimensional form.\nTwo AFM data sets representing a silicon calibrating grid at di\ufb00erent\noptical scales have been analysed throughout this work. The quadrangular\nfeatures observed in the grid were characterized using the PDE-based ap-\nproach proposed here and it was found that the side length and height found\nfor the set with 90 complete surface features are equal to 4.82 \u00b5m and 345.79\nnm on each respective case, whilst the data set representing four complete\nsurface features presents a side length equal to 5.086 \u00b5m and a height of\n348.05 nm. The discrepancy in these values is expected since the values\nfound for the data set with four complete surface features are essentially a\nrefinement of the measurement of a particular area within the grid. Addi-\ntionally, an AFM surface profile of a PNIPA surface was characterized using\nthe Biharmonic equation. To that end, transversal curves along the entire\nprofile were extracted and a total of 10 PDEs were solved. The resulting\nPDE surface representation was used to calculate the total surface area of\nthe profile, which has been found equal to 6.07 x 108 [nm2]. This suggests\nthat the surface generation technique adopted here may provide means for\ncharacterizing physical properties describing the surface\u2019s functionality that\ndepend on the surface area.\nSix samples of WLI of experimental data representing di\ufb00erent compon-\nents obtained from the same mould have been analysed. The surface features\npresent in these components presented a circular cylindrical shape with dif-\n21\nferent base and top radii. A procedure for extracting the necessary boundary\ncurves was implemented so that they could be extracted semi-automatically.\nThe coe\ufb03cients associated with each feature were then employed to find the\nvalues of the geometry parameters associated with this shape. Thus, it has\nbeen found that the PDE-based technique developed here can be potentially\nimplemented in the production line as a quality assessment technique since\nit has been shown that it can detect features that do not meet the min-\nimum requirements imposed for certain design parameters. However, either\nan overestimation or otherwise was noticed for some design parameters. This\nis seen as an artifact of the semi-automatic curve extraction procedure, which\ncan be eliminated if some refinements of such procedures are imposed.\nThis work is intended to be continued so that the methodology proposed\nhere can be fully implemented within the in-line production procedure. To\nthat end, the first aim is to refine the curve extraction methodology by adding\nsome criteria so that the algorithm responsible for averaging the experimental\ndata can weight each point according to some guidelines, which reflect on\nthe critical importance of certain measurements. Furthermore, PDE-based\nsurface profiles of polymer-blend surfaces will be used to determine physical\nproperties of larger scale surfaces. This will be carried out using a multi-scale\napproach with numerical techniques for describing properties such as thermal\ncontact resistance or heat transfer.\nAcknowledgements\nWe wish to acknowledge Dr Peter Twigg, of the School of Engineering,\nDesign and Technology, for the AFM measurement on PNIPA.
