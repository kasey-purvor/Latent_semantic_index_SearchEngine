While people may subscribe to \negalitarian values, this seems hollow to some observers in the context of relations between \nwomen and men, notably the sexual division of labour.  Some even talk of men exploiting the \nlabour of women.  This paper considers the validity of these claims in the Was valley of the \nSouthern Highlands Province, using data collected in a time-budget survey conducted to \ndocument and assess differences between women\u201fs and men\u201fs activities.  It also reviews ideas \nof time expended undertaking any activity, and the relevance of notions of work and labour to \npeople\u201fs daily routines.  It questions the propriety of introducing the capitalism\u201fs \npreoccupation with labour.  Differences in the activities of women and men far from \nevidencing relations of inequality are significant for such stateless political orders in \neschewing hierarchical arrangements, where no one exercises control over resources or capital \nneeded by others to secure livelihoods. \n \n[economic anthropology, time, work, gender] \n \nThe assertion of some writers that New Guinea societies feature institutionalised \ninequality (Strathern 1982; Jolly 1987; McDowell 1990; Kelly 1993; Wiessner 2002) has long \nperplexed me, as I take equality as a cardinal value (Sillitoe 1979, 1985, 2001).  It is central I \nthink to understanding how Wola material relations and political arrangements differ from \nthose of capitalist society.  According to some commentators the \u201ebig man\u201f complex \ndemonstrates that some persons achieve positions of leadership above others (Berndt & \nLawrence 1973; Godelier & Strathern 1991).  Any man endowed with the required qualities \ncan aspire to big man status.  It is an achieved not an ascribed position inherited by virtue of \nbirth (although it is suggested in some places that the sons of big men are in a better position \nthan others to make the grade, if they personally have what it takes).  It is an informal \nstanding consequently, not an instituted office.  The qualities that make a man big, or the \nemphasis put on them, vary from one place to another.  They range from an ability to \n                                                 \n1\n Acknowledgements to Rena Lederman (1986) for inspiration. \n 2 \ncontribute to festivals and feasts and manipulate wealth in exchange contexts, to a capacity to \norate and silver-tonguedly persuade others in argument, and from intrepid reputations as \nwarriors backed up by aggressive personalities, to having specialised sacred knowledge, \nwhich may extend to fearsome reputations for sorcery.  The status of a big man declines as \nthese qualities wane with age: distinction depends on current ability.   \nThe implications of big man status vary from one region to another.  In some places \nsuch persons reportedly exert considerable political control over the activities of small, \nvaryingly constituted, local groups, directing others\u201f behaviour by force of character, proven \nability, and by putting them in their debt.  Some writers even refer to despotic big men \n(Strathern 1966; Watson 1967) who have authority to make decisions, issue directions and \napply sanctions to other members of their community, and may even have recourse to force to \nback up their political authority.  In other regions, such as the Was valley of the Southern \nHighlands, while some influence accrues to certain esteemed persons as first among equals - \nmen paying more heed to their thoughts and advice than they do others\u201f - they cannot be said \nto achieve, nor create for themselves, positions of political leadership.  The value placed on \nequality ensures that while they are respected and admired persons of repute, they have \nneither political authority nor power.     \nOther commentators focus not on relations between men but those between men and \nwomen arguing that it is here that relations particularly feature inequality (Josephides 1983, \n1985; Modjeska 1982, 1995; Strathern 1988).  If it exists, such inequality undermines any \nnotion of egalitarianism, for even if men subscribe to an ethic of parity in structuring their \nrelations with one another, so long as they do not extend it to their relations with women, or in \nextreme interpretations manipulate these to dupe them, it is a sham.  The view that gender \nrelations are unequal is largely Marxist, arguing that Highland New Guinea cultures feature \nthe exploitation of women, men taking unfair advantage of their labour.  Put bluntly, women \n 3 \ndo more work and men appropriate some of the product.  The different amounts of time \nwomen and men put into cultivation, the engine of the Was valley \u201eeconomy\u201f (which remains \nsubsistence oriented), would seem to confirm this view, with women spending four times \nlonger than men on agricultural tasks (at 11.2 hours per person a week compared to 2.8 hours \n\u2013 Sillitoe, Stewart & Strathern 2002, p. 106).  This view associates labour with activities \nthought of as related to the \u201eeconomy\u201f, which in the absence of market arrangements and cash \npayments (as wages etc.) are identified with the subsistence domain and material aspects of \nexistence.   \nThe idea that work relates to material outcomes has a long history in Western thought \nfrom the enlightenment philosophers Locke and Smith through to their nineteenth century \nsuccessors such as Ricardo, Marx and Engels, to many contemporary economic and social \ncommentators.  In Locke\u201fs words, \u201cIt is labour indeed that puts difference of value on every \nthing . . . I think it will be but a very modest computation to say, that of the products of the \nearth useful to the life of man nine tenths are the effects of labour\u201d (1764, p. 25).  This \nmaterialistic assumption has informed interpretations of people\u201fs behaviour elsewhere for \nmany years.  Malinowski (1929, pp. 33-34) for instance gives work an unambiguous material \ndefinition \u201clabour must be defined in that it achieves something tangible and useful that \nserves to the satisfaction of man's essential wants. The search for food and its preparation, the \nprocuring of material for housing, clothing, weapons, and direct objects of use constitute the \nmost important types of labour.  \u2026. Labour should be defined as a purposeful form of \nsystematic activity standardized by tradition and devoted to the satisfaction of wants, the \ncreation of objects of luxury, value and renown.\u201d 2  Such activity is work, which we think of \n                                                 \n2\n See also Malinowski 1925, pp. 926-30.  Subsequent writers have taken a similar line, such as Wallman in a \nvolume on the anthropology of work, who defines work \u201cas the production, management and conversion of the \nresources necessary to livelihood\u201d (1979, p. 20), and Firth (1979, p. 192) in the same volume, who tells us that \nthe Tikopia had a concept of work, which indicates expenditure of energy for accomplishment of ends, at some \n 4 \nas laborious and assume individuals would rather not undertake, and if some spend more time \non it than others, and have some of their output taken without repayment in the products of \nsimilar work, we say that their labour is exploited and that they are treated unequally.  In part, \nthe physical nature of the activities associated with subsistence informs the view that they are \nwork.  It is undeniable that such physical tasks are energetically demanding and that women \nconsequently invest considerable amounts of energy in their homesteads\u201f livelihoods (Sillitoe \n2002).\n3\n   \nIn capitalist society, the idea that physical work is labour is prominent, and here \nexploitation is often evident in the low wages paid to, for example, farm workers, building \nlabourers and assembly line employees.  The capitalist hierarchy depends to a large extent on \nthe sort of work you do and, up to a certain point, the income that you receive and hence your \nmaterial standard of living, and there is a tendency to import these values into interpretations \nof arrangements elsewhere.  We seek to identify the work that people do and proceed to \nevaluate relations in terms of it.  This paper seeks to explore these assumptions through two \nlines of evidence, one an analysis of how people spend their time, and the other how they \nassess their use of time and the activities they engage in.  It acts on Gell\u201fs (1992) contention \nthat \u201ctime-budgeting studies\u201d should form the basis of anthropological investigations of time, \nthat these should begin with \u201ctime-economics, \u201eobjectively\u201f understood\u201d (1992, p. 321) and \nseek to combine the study of both the \u201cdomain of physical time\u201d and \u201chuman (i.e. cognitive) \ntime\u201d (1992, p. 241), on the grounds that while everything happens in \u201cthe \u201ereal\u201f world\u201d this \nis \u201cnot \u201eour\u201f world\u201d, which is a \u201cshifting play of images\u201d.  The problem he thinks is that \u201cno \nreal effort has been made to bridge the gap between time-budget studies (a pretty dull subject \n                                                                                                                                                        \nsacrifice of comfort or leisure.  Panoff (1977, p. 7) glosses work for the Maenge of New Britain as activity aimed \nat the production of useful things.   \n3\n But men make a contribution too, and the strenuous fits-and-bursts nature of their contributions to cultivation \nand construction compared to the steady character of women\u201fs outlays offsets the difference to some extent \n(Sillitoe, Stewart & Strathern 2002).   \n 5 \nin the estimation of most anthropologists I know) and \u201eexciting\u201f topics having to do with \ncollective representations and the mediation of social processes\u201d (1992, p. 322).4  This paper \nis one attempt at bridge construction.  While it does not deny that women and men have \ndifferent responsibilities and commitments, it questions that one gender\u201fs duties and \nobligations are superior to the other\u201fs and facilitates exploitation of labour and unfair \nrelations, even the existence of classes according to some (Godelier 1986, p. 143).   \nIt is argued that the focus on equality is an error because persons differ, according to \nage and gender if nothing else, such that a young woman finds herself in a different position \nto a mature man (Josephides 1985; Kelly 1993; Jolly 1987).  The implication is that persons \ncannot be equal, with young and old, capable and less able individuals.  This is to associate \nequality with sameness, but as Salzman (1999, p. 42) points out, by taking individual \ndifferences such as those of \u201cstrength, energy, astuteness, luck, fierceness, fertility and many \nmore . . . everyone, everywhere, could be deemed \u201eunequal\u201f\u201d.  There is I argue some \nconfusion of difference with inequality (Josephides 1983).  Persons do not have to be the \nsame to enjoy political equality.  Among the Wola such differences do not support a hierarchy \nof differential relations, some above others.  Everyone has the same opportunities and rights \nto freedom of action within the established mores of their culture.  All are politically equal, no \none having authority over others (except adults over small children), nor consequently the \npower to enjoy a higher standard of living.  Every person living in the Was valley has the \nsame to eat, some do not go hungry while others have plenty, and all live in houses of similar \ndimensions and built of the same materials, and they have access to the same resources and \nequal opportunities to exploit them.  It may occur that personal relations are asymmetrical, \n                                                 \n4\n A recent collection of essays edited by James and Mills (2005) criticises this approach for omitting to consider \nhistory as a component of any appreciation of time.  The criticism is misplaced, I think, rather like chiding the \ncompilers of today\u201fs bus timetables for having no concern with the hostelries of former stage coaches.  The \nimplication is not that we should ignore history and mythical time, rather that they are different issues to those of \ncontemporary reckoning and budgeting of time.  While awareness of time past will inevitably inform \nunderstanding of time present, this is, I propose, a separate matter to the current use of time. \n 6 \nsome men bully their wives, and some women scold their husbands, but beyond a certain \npoint persons can withdraw from an irksome relationship. And while the talents of some \npersons may secure them a degree of influence in certain contexts, this is limited and does not \ntranslate into authority.  Indeed I argue that the self-interested striving of individuals for status \nand respect feeds back to reaffirm social relations without openly detracting from others\u201f \nsocially circumscribed personal autonomy (Sillitoe 1979).   \n \nEthnographic Background \nWola speakers of the Southern Highlands Province, like other New Guinea \nHighlanders, follow a wide-ranging sexual division of labour (Sillitoe 1985).  A marked \ngender division, for example, informs cultivation, men undertaking the initial work of clearing \nand fencing and woman assuming responsibility largely for routine cultivation.  They are \nswidden and fallow horticulturalists, their neat gardens dotted about their valleys.  Sweet \npotato is the staple, typically cultivated in composted mounds; other crops include bananas, \ntaro, various cucurbits and greens (Bourke et al. 1995; Sillitoe 1996).  These people occupy \nfive valleys from the Mendi river in the east to the Augu in the west, the data discussed here \ncoming from the Nipa Basin Census Division, notably the Was valley in the west.  The \ncountry is rugged, comprising sharp-crested mountain ridges.  Watersheds and some valley \nareas are heavily forested, other settled parts are under regrowth, notably cane grassland.  The \nregion is described as peripheral in development terms, although the Highlands Highway runs \nthrough Wola territory.  Cash crops are few to non-existent.  But with gas and oil finds the \nposition may change, with exploitation of these in the near future. \nPeople live in homesteads comprising nuclear or extended families, scattered along the \nsides of valleys, indistinctly grouped together on territories, to which kinship structures access \nto land (Sillitoe 1999a), resulting in loosely constituted patrifilially biased bilateral kin \n 7 \ncorporations.  Wolaland is divided up into a large number of territories to which these kin \ncomposed groups, called sem \u201efamilies\u201f, claim rights collectively.  The exchange of wealth \nbetween defined categories of kin on specified social occasions is a prominent feature of \nsocial life \u2013 pigs and cash today and previously sea-shells among other valuables (Ryan 1961; \nSillitoe 1979; Lederman 1986).  The transactions remain today a significant force for order in \ntheir fiercely egalitarian society with weak central government authority.  Lawless \u201erascal\u201f \nactivity is prevalent throughout the region.  The government station at Nipa in the Nembi \nvalley has some administrative offices, including nominally a police station, school and health \ncentre, and several trade stores.  Men who excel at exchange achieve positions of renown and \ninfluence locally, earning the appellative ol howma, approximating to big-men elsewhere.  \nBut they do not extend to authority to direct the actions of others.  Women who regularly \nmanage more pigs than others earn the appellative of ten howma for their widely respected \nability; as with men this title carries no authority.  Supernatural beliefs centred on ancestors' \nspirits causing sickness and death by \u201eeating\u201f vital organs, others powers of sorcery and \n\u201epoison\u201f, and malevolent forest spirits.  Sometimes people offered pigs to restrain these \nmalicious supernatural powers.  Today the majority profess to be Christians and attend \nmission services.   \n \nTime expenditure survey: methods \nTime expenditure survey data afford an opportunity to appraise the extent of unequal \ndemands on men\u201fs and women\u201fs labour, showing how individuals spend their time.  These \ndata come from two surveys that document the time budgets of a sample of women and men \nfor nigh on a three month period.  A review of the time they invest in various activities is one \nway to assess differences between them and any unfairness in work loads.  Initially I arranged \na pilot of twelve days duration in 1974, in which thirteen women and fourteen men \n 8 \nparticipated, and subsequently in 1977 a main survey of seventy-two days duration, in which \nthirteen women and twelve men took part (two of the women completed the survey jointly, \nwhen one of them dropped out, the other took over).  The pilot established the feasibility of \nconducting such a survey and helped identify problems that needed attention to ensure smooth \nprogress and the gathering of information of acceptable accuracy.  Seven of the women who \ntook part in the pilot participated in the full survey and five of the men; a total of eighteen \nwomen and twenty-one men co-operated in the surveys.\n5\n  The surveys used the twenty-four \nhour recall method.  The procedure was for the participants to come to my house daily to \nreport on their activities over the previous twenty-four hours, and a standard survey sheet was \ncompleted for each person every day, the men came in the morning and the women in the \nafternoon.   \nThe times that participants had spent on the activities in which they had engaged were \nestimated according to what they told us.  A range of methods was used to make the \nestimates, including the position of the sun in the sky, the start or end of periods of rainfall or \nother events known in common to us.  Also, I asked those involved in the survey to shout out \nto me if they passed my house or they saw me elsewhere during the course of the day.  I gave \nthree of my friends digital watches too and asked them to make a note of the time whenever \nthey saw one of the survey respondents.  Sometimes it was possible triangulate between these \nprecisely timed events and the person subsequently meeting others participating in the survey \nsometime afterwards.  On a few occasions I accompanied the participants during the day and \n                                                 \n5\n I am grateful to all those who participated in the surveys, who received a token payment at the end, for their \npatience and good humour.  The women (numbers in brackets indicate first and second surveys): Maenget \nKwalten (1 & 2), Maenget Orlaem (1), Maenget Wariyn (1), Mayka Wen (1 & 2), Mayka Hendep (1 & 2), \nMayka Nonk (1 & 2), Mayka Hundbin (1), Mayka Huwn (1), Mayka Lenday (1 & 2), Mayka Puliym (1 & 2), \nMayka Morom (1), Mayka Nanainj (1), Mayka Naelomnonk (1 & 2), Mayka Wariyem (2), Puwgael Saliyn (2), \nPuwgael Piriyn (2), Maenget Ibnawaem (2), Mayka Ebel (2) and Maenget Sal (2).

I am also grateful to my wife Jackie for helping me with the \nsurvey, in particular ensuring the ready co-operation of women. \n 9 \nwas able to time their activities, these data serving to check the plausibility of the estimated \ntimes.  On balance, I judge that the estimates are within an hour, and sometimes considerably \nmore accurate, as in addition to having the help of persons\u201f comments about the time of day, I \nhad a good idea how long various tasks took (such as to cook food in an earth oven, heap up a \nsweet potato mound, walk to various destinations, and so on).   \nThe estimation of many of the times, with a margin of error up to an hour or more, is \nclearly a weakness; another is the gross documentation of activities \u2013 Waddell 1972, pp. 229-\n331, who conducted a similar survey with some Enga speakers, notes similar methodological \nshortcomings.  Activities were recorded in coarse categories, often lumping several actions \ntogether.For example, cultivation tasks intermingled during a day in a garden (such as women \nburning refuse, tilling soil for mounds, heaping these up and planting) could not be \ndisaggregated without being present to time the work.\n6\n  A more closely monitored survey \nmight have attempted to break down observed behaviour according to various tasks; for \nexample, instead of just \u201estring making\u201f it would have noted stripping bark off saplings, \nseparating fibre, arranging fibre to dry, shredding it and rolling into string.\n7\n  The omission of \nsome activities is a further shortcoming, respondents not mentioning everything about their \nday\u201fs activities.  They doubtless forgot some things and decided to leave out others.  No one \never mentioned coitus, for instance, yet it seems improbable that all respondents observed \nchastity during the survey.  In view of their attitudes to intercourse, it would have been \nembarrassing to have even intimated, let alone asked participants outright about it.  Such \ninsensitive questioning would have prompted respondents to stop co-operating in the survey \nentirely, as no one would wish to disclose such behaviour.   \n                                                 \n6\n Classified in this analysis according to the task the respondent said she had spent most time engaged on. \n7\n I have attempted this level of documentation in other work that complements these time survey data (see \nSillitoe 1988 on artefacts, Sillitoe, Stewart & Strathern 2002 on crop cultivation and Sillitoe 2003 on animal \nhusbandry), such that interested readers can determine the likely proportion of time persons spent on tasks that \nmake up activities, such as manufacturing various artefacts and different crop cultivation and animal husbandry \ntasks. \n 10 \nWhile the accuracy of the time budget data is open to critical review, these \nshortcomings do not invalidate them, only indicate the level of confidence one can have \nrelative to any interpretation.  So long as due care is exercised in using them, they are not \nexpected them to bear more weight of an argument than they can sustain, such data can serve \nas useful evidence.  The error margin is acceptable for the purposes of this paper, the data \ngiving a sufficient indication of participants\u201f time budgets.  The documentation of people\u201fs \ndaily activities more accurately would entail following them with a stop-watch in hand, giving \na record to the minute rather than the hour.  But such an intrusive method is likely to distort \nbehaviour.  It is probable that tailing people would affect their actions, such that they would \nno longer be leading their normal daily lives but putting on something for the observer\u201fs \nbenefit.  One way around this problem is to arrange random spot-checks of the behaviour of a \nsample of persons, as Grossman (1984a, p. 269; 1984b) did on 69 days for a village in the \nKainantu region of the Eastern Highlands, extrapolating from the results the percentage of \ntime spent on different activities.  Salisbury (1962, pp. 216-220) had previously used such a \nspot-check method in the neighbouring Goroka region, but apparently without telling people \nthat he was \u201efollowing\u201f their activities.  More recently, Umezaki et al. (2002) visited subjects \nhourly during a study in the Tari Basin region of the Southern Highlands, to check on their \nactivities over a seven day period..  Even spot-checking or shadowing would miss some \npersonal activities, as respondents would demand some periods of privacy.  Accuracy has to \nbe traded off against practicality; to achieve such coverage of the same sized sample of \npersons as in the Was valley survey would demand six years of non-stop field research, and \nthe data from such a period of research would represent a fearsome analytical challenge, even \nwith computers.  Anyway, it is unlikely that participants would submit to such close \nsurveillance for any period of time, and certainly not three months.  So we should be \n 11 \nforfeiting duration of survey for accuracy of observation.  Time expenditure data are partial, \nhowever collected.\n8\n   \n \n \nTime expenditure survey: results \nThe results of the time expenditure survey corroborate everyday impressions of \nwomen\u201fs and men\u201fs daily activities (Table 1).  They confirm that women devote a \nconsiderable part of their week to agricultural tasks, particularly when we include time spent \nharvesting food; they spend on average about twenty eight hours a week engaged in such \nactivities (16.8% of their time).  The inclusion of foraging for food adds little to the time they \nspend on subsistence activities.  Another activity that occupies a considerable amount of their \ntime is travel.  They spend 11.2 hours weekly walking to places; 9.1 of these hours relate to \ncultivation work too as time spent walking to and fro from gardens.  Cooking and eating \noccupy a similar period of time each week at about eleven hours thirty minutes (6.8% of their \ntime).  Other activities occupy them for comparatively small periods of time on average, all of \nless than an hour any day.  The manufacture of artefacts, the next most demanding activity, \noccupies a little over five and one half hours a week; including the collection of raw materials \nincreases it by only forty-two minutes.  Attending to pigs, which comes next, demands 3.2 \nhours weekly. \nThe contribution of men to subsistence activities is considerably less than women at \ntwelve hours eight minutes a week in total, that is including gardening, harvesting, hunting \nand gathering pursuits (7.2% of their time).  They spend a comparable amount of time to \nwomen travelling between places, at 9.9 hours weekly walking to locations to attend to \n                                                 \n8\n For further discussion of methodological issues involved in time budget studies see Carlstein 1982, Gross 1984, \nGrossman 1984b, Ulijaszek 1995. \n 12 \nvarious pursuits; 2.8 hours walking to and from gardens.  An activity that occupies a \nconsiderable part of their time is attending and participating in a wide range of exchange \ntransactions, which demands ten and a half hours a week on average (5.6% of their time); \nsome of the time men spend at funerals also concerns exchange issues.  They spend a little \nlonger than women cooking and eating food at fourteen hours weekly (8.3% of their time).  \nAnother activity that takes up a considerable part of their time is construction work, of houses \nlargely, which demands about seven hours a week.  Other activities occupy them for \ncomparatively small periods of time on average, all of less than an hour a day.  The collection \nand chopping of firewood is the next most demanding activity, it requiring three and a half \nhours a week to keep homesteads supplied with sufficient wood, or a little longer including \nthe contribution of women.  Attending and taking part in disputes, which comes next, takes up \ntwo hours weekly, and artefact manufacture one hour forty minutes. \nIt is convenient to review the overall time expenditure position by collecting together \nrelated activities.  The pie diagrams summarise the position for women and men, grouped-\nactivity slices matched to facilitate comparison (Figures 1 and 2).  It is evident that men spend \nmore time in the daytime resting than women, some seven hours a week more.\n9\n  The \nimplication is not that women have little opportunity for relaxation; they also spend periods of \ntime resting, some three hours and ten minutes weekly on average.  If we consider time \nresting and sleeping, the imbalance between the sexes is redressed to some extent as women \nretire a little earlier on average than men, such that women spend 95.9 hours a week asleep or \nresting and men 99.7 hours.  The pie diagrams show clearly that men make up the difference \nin time that women devote to subsistence tasks by attending more often to public activities \n                                                 \n9\n A reviewer of this paper suggested that men's rest and social time should distinguish the time they spent \ngambling, but at the scale of the comparisons attempted here (collecting like activities together into categories) \nthis activity does not show up, with attendance at card games accounting for only 7 hours (0.0004%) of their \ntotal reported time.  In Grossman\u201fs (1984a, pp. 216-19) time-use study, card playing together with beer drinking \nare prominent activities, increasing with the receipt of cash crop incomes, behaviour that he argues contributes to \na \u201esubsistence malaise\u201f that jeopardizes food security.   \n 13 \nincluding various exchange transactions, funerals and disputes.  This confirms everyday \nimpressions, widely reported across the highlands, that men engage more frequently in \ncommunity wide events, women\u201fs lives focussing more on the homestead sphere.  While men \nmay vociferously dominate such public events, women are not confined to the private \ndomestic domain with no influence or say; they can exert considerable indirect influence via \ntheir male relatives, some individuals manipulating them to good effect (see Sillitoe 2003 on \nevents involving pigs).   \nThe survey conducted by Waddell (1972, pp. 98-102) among the Enga shows broadly \nsimilar results with women engaging more in subsistence farming, although the difference \nbetween them and men in participating in exchange and related activities is not so marked.  \nSome further comparisons can be made with other highland New Guinea time-use studies, if \none suspends doubts about the accuracy and representativeness of the various data sets (Table \n2).\n10\n  According to these data, the Wola and Huli have the least equal division between men \nand women (at about 40:60) of time spent on subsistence activities of these Highlands groups, \nand Huli men followed by Enga men actually work the fewest hours.  The Huli and Enga \nwomen also work the fewest hours for women (about 31 hours), while the data for the other \nthree groups show a convergence towards a female average of women spending 40 hours a \nweek on such activities.  The Duna support 1.1 pigs per person, the Enga 2.3 pigs and the \nWola 3.8 pigs per person,\n11\n which translates into 33.2 hours of subsistence activity among the \nDuna per pig, 11.5 hours among the Enga and 8.6 hours among the Wola.  A reviewer of this \n                                                 \n10\n Direct comparison is difficult as Waddell and Umezaki et al. omit some activities from their analyses such as \nresting, preparing food and eating, and making artefacts.  The results of Salisbury\u201fs (1962, pp. 217-19) time \nbudget analysis are even more difficult to compare and considers only men, while Grossman\u201fs (1984a) include a \nrange of quite different cash earning activities. \n11\n The women surveyed in the Was valley had charge on average of 3.8 pigs each (1.3 adult, 0.6 adolescent and \n1.9 piglets) and 0.1 cassowaries. \n 14 \npaper thought this variation either \u201craises strong doubts about the consistency of these \nstudies\u201d or \u201cthe Duna are for some reason highly inefficient pig producers\u201d.12   \nThe Tairora data from the Kainantu region (Grossman 1984a) show what happens \nwhen cash crops arrive, the unequal distribution of subsistence activities between the sexes is \noffset by a reverse contribution to cash cropping and waged labour outside the village by men \n(although it is probable that women were not responsible for so many subsistence activities in \npre-cash crop times).  A similar reversal has been documented for Huli speakers (Umezaki et \nal. 2002).  While this pattern may appear favourable to those who subscribe to the view that \nwomen\u201fs labour is exploited under the subsistence regime, the consequences of the shift from \nsubsistence activities to cash cropping and waged labour can be considerable for food \nsecurity.  Grossman (1981, p. 232; 1984a, p. 218) has dubbed it as move from \u201esubsistence \naffluence\u201f to \u201esubsistence malaise\u201f. \nWhile the time survey was conducted some years ago, the budgeting patterns revealed \nprobably remain much the same today (from casual observation, not further data collection).  \nRelations between women and men locally remain largely unchanged with respect to daily \nactivities (on other dimensions of change, see Nihill 1994 on gender and development in the \nsouthern Nembi valley, and Knauft 1997 on Melanesia generally).  The Was valley population \ncontinues to depend on subsistence agriculture for its livelihood with no significant \ntechnological innovations, and farming activities remain unchanged.  People continue to make \nmany of the things that they need and construct their own homes; albeit they have \nincreasingly incorporated foreign materials into their manufacture (e.g. net bags may be made \nfrom unravelled synthetic material rather than locally made bark fibre string).  The collapse of \n                                                 \n12\n The inefficiency issue only arises if one thinks of people producing pigs in the New Guinea Highlands.  If one \nthinks of them instead as converters of waste into useful product, the discrepancy is less of a problem because as \nnumbers of pigs in a herd increase, so their daily ration falls, the waste produced by the household remaining the \nsame (Sillitoe 2003, p. 315).  In other words, if the people surveyed had different sized pig herds, this need not \nreflect differing pig keeping efficiencies, if they were varying the fodder fed to animals as herd sizes varied. \n 15 \nthe state across the Southern Highlands has resulted in violent confrontations and armed \nhostilities may occur when disputes boil over, whereas at the time of the surveys colonial and \nnew nation authority prevailed.  Socio-political exchange transactions remain prominent, \nfeaturing pigs and money largely, albeit the use of the latter in commodity purchases is \nconfusing the traditional transactional logic (Strathern & Stewart 2000).  Money changes \nhands locally more often in these contexts than commercial ones, although some individuals \nseek to increase their access to cash by looking for waged work elsewhere, often in the \nWestern Highlands, and if successful may absent themselves and their families from the \nvalley for months and even years at a time, particularly if they have some education, and \nsome of these persons are effectively lost to the region, becoming caught up in contractual \nrelations elsewhere.  These latter disappeared persons, together with the Member elected to \nthe House of Assembly in Port Moresby, are the only manifestation of emerging class \nrelations, as reported elsewhere in Papua New Guinea (Donaldson and Good 1988; Gewertz \nand Errington 1999). \nThe time expenditure data suggest that women and men are broadly speaking equally \nactive.  Both average about ten hours a day engaged in activities of one sort or another, which \nconfirms the impression of a busy population.  While individuals may vary in their \nindustriousness, it is not the case that all women are engaged in tasks while men free load on \ntheir efforts.  This is expectable in an egalitarian order where such exploitation of the labour \nof some by others would be inconsistent with ideals of equality.  So why is it that so many see \nwomen as exploited by men?  The answer appears to depend on perceptions of time and \ndefinitions of work.  If you subscribe to the idea that time is limited and take the view that \ntime spent on livelihood related tasks is work, unlike that devoted to other activities, then \nwomen, who we have seen put more time into subsistence occupations, necessarily labour \nmore and have less time for other activities.   \n 16 \nConcepts of time  \nThe way in which the Wola conceive of time, and how they judge its passage, are \ncritical to the reliability of these time expenditure data.  If they have no idea of time that one \ncan relate to a clock, this would call the twenty-four hour recall method into question.  We \nalso need some idea of their temporal perceptions to compare with our belief that time is in \nlimited supply and assess the extent to which people think time spent on certain laborious \ntasks takes away from that available to participate in other more pleasurable activities, so that \nif some persons spend more time on these tasks than others it is unfair, even possibly \nexploitative.  The pilot survey assessed the recall method\u201fs reliability.  Initially I had expected \nsome clashes between my clock driven view of time and the participants\u201f diurnal rhythm one, \nand was pleasantly surprised at how readily they understood what I was after.  This was due \nin considerable part to the congruence between the way they divide up the day and the clock\u201fs \nmeasurement of time\u201fs passage, and their acute awareness of changes throughout the day \n(such as changes in cloud formation, wind direction, the sun\u201fs transit and so on), which I \ncould also monitor.   \nSo far as I am aware the Wola have no word for time as an abstract concept.  If they \nrefer to something happening in the future they may use the word tomb, which is the nearest \nword to time known to me, although it more usually has the sense \u201ewhen\u201f \u2013 for example, in \nthe phrase diyr bor tomb, literally \u201ebanana ripe time\u201f, or more freely translated \u201ewhen the \nbananas ripen\u201f.  If enquiring of someone when an event is going to occur, they may start the \nquestion by adding the interrogative prefix ae to give aetomb which translates as \u201ewhen?\u201f \u2013 \nfor example, aetomb em pokesi, literally \u201ewhen garden go-will-[you]?\u201f, or more freely \u201ewhen \nwill you be going to the garden?\u201f.  Furthermore, they have words for now or today, which are \nngubiytomb or embiy, and periods before and after the present, which are ombez and maebort \nrespectively.  Other temporal markers include ereb, which indicates later and wen for soon.  \n 17 \nToday, it is common to hear people use the pidgin taim for time, particularly in relation to the \nEuropean hourly system of time reckoning, another indication that their vocabulary lacked \nsuch an idiom.  Intriguingly, people show a considerable interest in wrist watches (pidgin klok \nor hanwas), which I have found make popular gifts.  They may ask the time as klok aez, \u201ewhat \nis the time?\u201f. Ryan (1992, p. 224) catches the position well in the Mendi valley, when he \ndiscusses the system he devised to pay informants in his witty reflection on his research \nexperiences, \u201calthough they had no clocks, and couldn\u201ft measure \u201etime\u201f, they knew that I \ncould, and that one revolution of the big hand of my clock marked a unit of duration to which \nI apparently attached some importance.  So they proposed . . . that each informant would have \nhis personal string in which he would tie a knot for each revolution of that big hand.  . . . [to \ncalculate] the precise number of hours they would have to work\u201d to earn the payment they \nsought \u2013 salt, knife, shell or whatever. \nWhile the Wola may not traditionally have had a system that allowed the fine \nmathematical division of the day into hours and minutes, they have an extensive vocabulary \nfor different times of the hort \u201eday\u201f.  The day starts with ba biy \u201ethe singing of birds at dawn\u201f \nand hokob kebay \u201ethe first light over the horizon\u201f, followed by hogowan \u201ethe morning\u201f, hora \n\u201emidday\u201f, ombuna \u201eafternoon\u201f, nolai kay \u201edusk\u201f (literally \u201ecicada talk\u201f, the time that cicadas \nstart to drone) and shomna \u201enight\u201f.  They can qualify these terms further, such that hogowan \nnat turiybiy (lit. morning sun pleasant) is early morning when the sun is pleasantly warm and \nnat taendabiy (lit. sun hurts) is late morning when the sun is often uncomfortably hot; hora \nhaeguw refers to the sun exactly overhead at noon and ombuna hohola is late afternoon.  \nAnother way to qualify these terms is with henenj which means \u201etrue\u201f, in a way that is \nreminiscent of the pidgin use of tru, such that hogowan henenj refers to early morning and \nshomna henenj refers to the deep of night.  People can further specify the time of day by the \nposition of the sun in the sky, or at night the position of the moon (when visible, although \n 18 \nindividuals are unlikely to be out and about \u2013 e.g. hunting - when there is no moon).  When \nwe combine the use of these time markers with local events known to all, such as the start of \nrain showers, lifting of cloud from valleys, descent of mist onto peaks and such, we have a \nhandy time reckoning system that certainly proved sufficiently robust for time budget survey \npurposes. \nBeyond the day and its parts, the Wola have an elaborate vocabulary to refer to the \npassage of days, which can recall back up to five days ago and extend forwards to seven days \nhence, as follows: \n \n ordnduwmaen = five days ago  nduwm = two days hence \n aebnduwmaen= four days ago  tundanay = three days hence \n baernduwmaen= three days ago  menztundanay = four days hence \n nduwmaen= two days ago  aebentundanay = five days hence \n ombaeka = yesterday  ordtundanay = six days hence \n embiy = today  orwatundanay = seven days hence \n ponabiy = tomorrow  \n \nThe Enga have a similar vocabulary (Meggitt 1958, p. 75).  There is no idea of collecting \nthese thirteen days into a higher period unit equivalent to a fortnight.  They are not static in \nthis way but roll on with the passage of days.  Another way of talking about the passage of \ndays is to number them: hort uwk mond, hort uwk kab, hort uwk teb\n13\n \u2013 one day, two days, \nthree days etc.  In theory, although I have never heard it in practice, people could specify up \nto forty-four days in the past or forty-four days in the future using their counting system, and \neven further with recounts, although this is improbable (Sillitoe in press).  The idea of the \nseven day week arrived with Europeans, which the Wola call shaeret,\n 14\n although one is as \nlikely to hear the pidgin word wik.  And a mission invented names for the days of the week,\n15\n \n                                                 \n13\n Literally day uwk one, day uwk two, day uwk three; the word uwk is a numeral classifiers (Sillitoe in press). \n14\n The derivation of this word is unclear. \n15\n The days of the week are as follows: Horondon (\u201ebig day\u201f - Sunday), Kongonmubon (\u201efirst work\u201f - Monday),  \nKongonkabon (\u201esecond work\u201f - Tuesday),  Kongontebon (\u201ethird work\u201f - Wednesday),  Kongonmogon (\u201efourth \nwork\u201f - Thursday),  Waeswaeson (\u201ewash-wash\u201f - Friday), and Horgenkon (\u201elittle day\u201f - Saturday). \n 19 \nalthough again one is as likely to hear the pidgin Sande, Mande etc. as Horondon, \nKongonmubon etc.   \nThe foregoing discussion makes it clear that while Wola concepts of time facilitate the \nsort of recall survey attempted here, it is difficult to equate their ideas directly with the \nexpenditure of time as investigated in the survey.  Although people can discuss their previous \nday\u201fs activities using customary categories such as \u201cmorning, when the sun was pleasant\u201d \ntogether with markers like the position of the sun in the sky, they are not accustomed to \ndiscussing the time it takes to do things in the abstract (e.g. approximating how long it will \ntake to fell a tree and coming up with an estimate such as \u201cfrom midday until mid afternoon\u201d) \nor reckoning the time they spend on different activities, as there is no call for such \ncalculations, as attempted here using the survey data.   \nThe implication of having fairly full days is that people may consider time limited.  \nWe need some idea of their sense of time to assess whether or not, like us, they think time is a \nscarce resource, in order to justify the assumption that time spent on certain, say laborious, \ntasks detracts from that available to engage in other activities.  It is a capitalist conception, \ncaught in the aphorism \u201etime is money\u201f, that we only have a limited amount of time available \nto do things.  While it is undeniable that time is physically limited for all humans, no one is \nimmortal and there are only a set number of hours in a day for all of us, how we perceive of \nthis is a culturally informed value judgement.  The Wola system distinguishes the ez \u201emonth\u201f, \nafter hort \u201eday\u201f discussed above.  A lunar cycle marks the passage of a month; the ez being \nliterally the moon.  People mark the time of the month by the phases of the moon (Figure 3.  It \nis during the later dobat, the buwt and the early homuwk phases that men may go hunting by \nmoonlight, and they call this period the sab ez, the \u201emarsupial moon\u201f.16 \n                                                 \n16\n According to Gell (1992, pp. 291-92) the Umeda people of the Western Sepik liken the moon to a tuber that \nvaries in its growth cycle, as lunations vary in duration.  I have never heard anyone allude to similar ideas in the \nWas valley. \n 20 \nWhile they have no vernacular names for the months, the year falls into two named \nseasons, called bulhenjip and ebenjip, which are the two largest periods by which the Wola \ntraditionally mark the passage of time.  There is considerable natural lore associated with \nthese two seasons (Sillitoe 1996, pp. 55-63).  The bulenjip season equates with the Southern \nwinter, extending from April to September, and ebenjip with the Southern summer, extending \nfrom October to March.  The Wola did not traditionally join the two seasons together to give a \nyear, although today people do refer to the twelve months as mol, an abbreviation of the \npidgin for Christmas, which they pronounce Krismol; they also use Pidgin yia.  The reference \nto Christmas shows missionary influence, which is otherwise relatively limited in the Was \nvalley with respect to notions of time, being largely evident in the institution of Sundays as \nlotu \u201echurch\u201f days and the introduction of Biblical millennial beliefs that do not affect \neveryday ideas of time.\n17\n  In some senses the three time periods - hort \u201eday\u201f, ez \u201emonth\u201f and \nbulhenjip\/ ebenjip seasons \u2013 do not comprise an integrated system marking the passage of \ntime.  The disagreements that occurred when I first tried to find out how many months in each \nseason \u2013 responses ranging from four to six - indicate that they are not integrated markers of \ntime, in the sense of comprising so many agreed \u201emoons\u201f.18  Nor do people reckon the number \nof days in an ez \u201emonth\u201f, which is just as well with a synodic system that would otherwise \ngradually lose synchrony with the solar cycle.\n19\n   This contrasts with some other regions of \nMelanesia that have marked seasons, such as the archipelago to the west of New Guinea \nwhere people have elaborate calendars (Austen 1939; Leach 1950; Damon 1981; Mondrag\u00f3n \n2004). \n                                                 \n17\n The impact of the adoption of the Gregorian calendar varies across New Guinea.  On the nearby Papuan \nPlateau it has had a considerable impact, perhaps due to the small and vulnerable population, Schieffelin (2002) \nassociating it with missionary attempts to obliterate the indigenous past as an impediment to Christian \nconversion. \n18\n In the end, the only sure way I could determine the span of the seasons was to ask what the season was every \nmonth for a year and note responses in a diary.  This brings to mind Turton and Ruggles (1978) account of \ndisagreements among the Mursi of Ethiopia as to the month at any time. \n19\n Meggitt 1958, pp. 76-77 notes the same issue for the Enga but maintains that they keep the lunar and solar \nsequences in step using a thirteen month year.  \n 21 \nThe daily through to monthly and seasonal time spans represent the limit of formal \ntime reckoning in the Wola vernacular.  While they have no Gregorian calendar-equivalent to \nmark the passage of longer, historical periods of time, they are able to conceive of and discuss \nsuch times past, although only in ways loosely connected with the above system of time \nkeeping.  One way refers to the unfolding of natural processes, such as the time that has \nelapsed since an area passed under fallow, which may be spoken of as when X had a garden at \nY.  Vegetation may serve here as a handy reference to time\u201fs passage, various regrowth \ncommunities taking different periods of time to establish themselves and become mature \n(Sillitoe 1996, pp. 217-224) \u2013 according to Waddell (1972, p. 77) the Enga focus on the \ngrowth of casuarina trees.  Another point of reference is the life history and age of \nindividuals, often spoken of relative to others, such as when A was like B\u201fs son C.  The Wola \nhave several words to mark the life progression of persons, from nonknais konay na wiy \n\u201ebaby\u201f (lit. girl\/ boy sense not has) through to ten or ol hunjiy \u201eelderly woman or man\u201f, and \nincluding nonk \u201egirl\u201f, nais \u201eboy\u201f, qualified as genk \u201esmall\u201f or onda \u201elarge\u201f, and markers for \nwomen (ten) and men (ol) as of child-bearing age (ten ka), newly married (ten wen), without \nchildren or a bachelor (ten\/ol hunuwmb), and widowed (ten\/ol wiya).  Another way they have \nof marking the passage of time is the ya pubung \u201eknotted string\u201f mentioned by Ryan above, \nwhere knots stand for periods of time, whether days or months.  Sometimes people agree to \nsomething in so many month\u201fs time, such as staging an exchange transaction, and tie that \nnumber of knots in a length of string, which they untie one at a time as each month passes, \nuntil there are no knots, which marks the arrival of the agreed date.  Going further back there \nis genealogical time, talking of events as occurring during a certain ancestral generation, such \nas \u201cin the days of grandfather Nolai\u201d.  And finally, when memories run out, there is mythical \ntime, which is out of time in the sense that unreal things happened such as marsupials \nbegetting human off-spring.  The Wola do not have a single idea of time but conceive of it in \n 22 \ndiffering ways depending on context, for as Munn (1992, p. 116) put it they \u201care \u201ein\u201f a \nsociocultural time of multiple dimensions (sequencing, timing, past-present-future relations \netc.) that they are forming in their \u201eprojects\u201f\u201d.   \nBeyond the foregoing daily, monthly and seasonal ideas, and discussion of time \naccording to the passage of natural events, I have always found it difficult to engage people in \nabstract discussions of time, and no one has ever intimated a systematic body of symbolic \nrepresentation.  Again Ryan (1992, p. 228) catches the position well, \u201cIf there was one \nimpression that my life with the Mendi had consistently reinforced, it was that they were \nutterly practical, pragmatic, down-to-earth materialists: . . . insight, expressed in poetic \nmetaphor, seemed totally alien to them\u201d.  While somewhat exaggerated perhaps in the light of \ntheir myths, songs, spells and rites, this sentiment reflects my overall experience too.  They \ndiffer from people elsewhere in New Guinea who present complex symbolic representations \nof time, such as the ritual identification of age grades with yam cultivation on the Sepik River \n(Harrison 1983).  It is common in discussions of people\u201fs conceptions of time to assign them \nto one of two opposite classes.  Either linear, as in European culture, where time is \nexperienced as a one-way journey from the past to the future, sometimes thought as real time.  \nOr circular, as in Australian Aboriginal culture, where time is conceived as going around \nendlessly with the past replicating itself in the present, sometimes presented as ritual time \n(Bloch 1977, p. 282; Gell 1992, pp. 23-36; Munn 1992, p. 101).  The former characterises \nperceptions of time as scarce, whereas the latter has a more timeless quality to it, or as Gell \n(1992, p. 211) puts it, there are \u201csocieties which do not make very intensive use of time and \nwhich seem to have low opportunity costs, vs. those societies that make intensive use of time \nand in which people are very conscious of opportunity costs\u201d.20  Neither representation \n                                                 \n20\n Few of us today, I venture, would subscribe to the idea of \u201estatic\u201f time or \u201etimeless cultures\u201f (Bloch 1977; \nMunn 1992, pp. 98-100; Perkins 2001, pp. 92-100), as opposed to conceding and seeking formulations that \nrepresent different cultural insights and conceptions of time and its passage. \n 23 \ncatches the essence of time in the Was valley as I glimpsed it in people\u201fs comments and \nbehaviour.  The view of time there accords more with what I should call a natural rhythm with \na focus on short term stretches of time, rarely extending beyond a life span and often \nconcerning considerably briefer periods.\n21\n   \nIn depicting the Wola sense of time, I should strive for something between the linear \nand circular models, and the nearest I can come up with is a spiral.  This is my imagery not \ntheirs, being reminiscent of Shakespeare\u201fs shuffling off the \u201emortal coil\u201f.  Each generation or \nlifespan represents one turn of the helix, giving us circularity without returning us to the \nstarting point as in closed circular structures, and each turn overlaps with the ones before and \nafter it, such that over time we have spiralling along the helix, giving us a sense of linearity \nbut with an element of repetition.  This captures the intriguing point that time features both \nrepetition (such as the cycle of the moon or seasons) and non-repetition (such as one\u201fs \nirreversible passage through life).\n22\n  Each generation reflects the last generation, with ancestor \nspirits lurking from earlier coils.  The Wola focus on the current loop of the spiral, they are \nhere-and-now people who do not have an extensive history going back into the distant past.   \nRegarding the future, they do not appear traditionally to have considered it much \ngenerally speaking, assuming that it would unroll much like the previous helical loop; \nalthough they did have a concern for, even premonitions of disruption.  So long as no such \nevent occurred, change was gradual from one generation to another, each revolution closely \nresembling the one previous.  Until, that is, the external world burst in on their valleys \nbringing extensive and rapid change.  But such interference was not entirely unprecedented \nwith the occurrence of occasional unsettling events such as famines and volcanic fall-out, and \n                                                 \n21\n Gell (1992) puts considerable store by Gale\u201fs (1968) distinction of \u201eA-series\u201f and \u201eB-series\u201f time (A-series = \npast \u2192 present \u2192 future, and B-series = before vs. after).  While the above Wola vocabulary might suggest an \nA-series conception of time, I think that there are other phrases that equally indicate a B-series before and after \nrepresentation, such as ombez ombez and ereb ereb which are similar to English \u201elong long ago\u201f and \u201efar far \nfuture\u201f. \n22\n Leach (1961, pp. 124-131) suggests a zigzag line while musing on Kachin and Greek conceptions of time. \n 24 \nto some extent they have accommodated to the outside changed order by latching on to \ncataclysmic parallels often cast in a millennial idiom, which gives some mission proselytising \nits appeal (Ungutip, Wabis & Sillitoe 1999).  The idea that the \u201eend of the world is nigh\u201f \ntinges their view of the future with a certain fatalism.   \nWhile time has a linear passing quality, which gives it a scarce property, it also has a \ncircular feel, which militates against it.  While time does not exactly repeat itself, there is an \nimpression that it goes slowly around again and again, which diminishes any feelings of \nurgency about time being in limited supply.  The prevalent attitude is one of \u201ewhat you do not \nfinish today, you can always do tomorrow or the next day or sometime\u201f.  There is rarely any \nsense of stress, except occasionally such as at critical stages in gardening or house building or \nmeeting exchange commitments.  The Wola intriguingly combine a realisation of having to \nachieve a certain amount in some period of time to ensure their livelihood, yet are relaxed \nabout taking the necessary action.   \n \nWhat is work? \nIn addition to their perceptions of time, it is necessary to know how people perceive of \nthe differences in women\u201fs and men\u201fs contributions to different tasks, to further our \nunderstanding of labour arrangements.  In short, how do they define work?  The answer to \nthis question is not straightforward because, so far as I am aware, the Wola language \ntraditionally has no word for work, distinguishing this from any other activity, in the sense of \ninvolving particular effort or labour, or earning an income.  This calls for some comment, \nalthough I do not wish to be side tracked into semantic mire.  While I do not subscribe \nentirely to the so-called Sapir Whorf hypothesis that language determines thoughts, I think \nthat if people do not have a word for a concept, such as work or time, this suggests that we \nmust exercise care in importing such linguistically absent ideas on the grounds that we \n 25 \nassume they are universal.  Everywhere people have to engage in activities with material \noutcomes in order to feed themselves, supply tools and other necessities such as shelter, and \nin doing so must invest labour in their production.  The question is the extent to which they \nthink of these materially related tasks as different from other activities, and if so, in what \nways.   \nSo what words do the Wola have for activities recorded in the time expenditure survey \nthat might suggest the idea of work?  They have a verb for \u201eto do\u201f or \u201emake\u201f, which is bay.23  \nIt is generic and has wide application.  It can refer to a range of activities such as em bay \n\u201egarden do\u201f, aend bay \u201ehouse make [construct]\u201f, nuw bay \u201enet-bag make\u201f and tesop bay \n\u201epearl-shell-fillet make\u201f.  There are a large number of terms for various operations that \ncomprise these activities, such as for the different tasks involved in establishing a garden \n(Sillitoe Stewart & Strathern 2002), various operations in manufacturing artefacts (Sillitoe \n1988) and building houses (such as levelling site, constructing walls, positioning rafters, \nthatching etc.).  However, the verb bay also applies to a wide range of other activities that sit \nuneasily with a materialist definition of labour such as saend bay \u201ehostilities do [fight]\u201f, ol \nbay \u201emortuary exchange do\u201f, aeret bay \u201edispute do\u201f, yort bay \u201eself-decoration do [put on \nmake-up]\u201f, and even neb bay \u201eplay do\u201f.  The broad spread of activities to which this verb \napplies intimates that Wola perceptions of them have something beyond material outcomes or \nphysical exertions.   \nThe inhabitants of the Was valley further distinguish lazy from industrious persons.  \nThose who tend towards idleness are paeka \u201elazy\u201f individuals.  The opposite is a buriy \n\u201estrong\u201f person, who may be spoken of as hombunja or onduwp biy, someone who \n\u201eeverything\u201f or \u201emuch does\u201f.  Again, they use these terms not only in reference to activities \n                                                 \n23\n They may extend this to bayaib bay, which is to do something.  Another verb meaning \u201eto do\u201f or \u201emake\u201f is \nwaeray but it applies to artefacts largely. \n 26 \nwith material outcomes, such as subsistence related undertakings, but also for life\u201fs activities \ngenerally.  They describe persons of renown as buriy \u201estrong\u201f, which catches something of the \nmeaning of the howma epithet, which is not a political status as such (although the successful \nmay find they have a certain degree of influence in some situations) but more a marker for \nactive individuals who are doing well.  They are the energetic doers, who achieve things \u2013 in \nthe case of men participate in many exchange transactions and women manage efficient \nhomesteads.  The time expenditure data in Table 3 bear this out to some extent.  Each column \non this and the following table represents an individual\u201fs time record, the persons arranged \naccording to their social standing with their ages.  The three men of highest standing spent \n9.7% of their time engaged in exchange activity (including attendance at funerals) and 58.3% \nresting or sleeping, compared to 4.4% and 61.9% respectively by the three men of least \nrenown.  They all spent similar amounts of time in cultivation activities at 3.9% versus \n3.5%.\n24\n  Similarly, the three women of highest standing spent 17.9% of their time engaged in \ncultivation activity (including harvesting crops) and 55.8% resting or sleeping, compared to \n14.1% and 60.5% respectively for the three women of lowest standing (Table 4).\n25\n   \nThese comparisons also show that individuals vary considerably in how they use their \ntime, which is expectable.  It is not only that socially ambitious men spend more time \nattending to exchange issues, supported by the industriousness of some female relatives, but \nalso that families vary in their demands depending on their place in the domestic \ndevelopmental cycle.  In this regard, people\u201fs activities relate in some measure to household \ndemography.  The more young children, for instance, the more effort demanded of women, \n                                                 \n24\n See Salisbury 1962, pp. 218-219 for comparative data on activities undertaken by men of different social \nstanding, although they are difficult to interpret as the \u201ebig men\u201f suffered from considerable sickness during the \nsurvey. \n25\n Differences in age confound these comparisons to some extent, as does the relatively short duration of the \nsurvey in relation to the frequency of some activities \u2013 e.g. men\u201fs exchange activities are dictated to some extent \nby the occurrence of social events over which they have no control [such as deaths], consequently those \noccurring during the survey period influenced participants\u201f transactional activity in part. \n 27 \nalthough often they can rely on support from other kin such as mothers and sisters.  As some \nof the children grow up, so they increasingly shoulder a share of the demands, but juveniles \nwill not contribute as much as adults.  The elderly are also less active and may depend to \nvarying extents on younger kin to support them.  The wide variations seen in the individual \ntime data (Tables 3 & 4) challenge the standard anthropological focus on normative \nbehaviour, which lumps persons together using customary devices, when they vary in their \nbehaviour.  One such device is the use of the word \u201ework\u201f to label a certain category of \nactivity involving physical effort and material outcomes, to collect people together, when we \nknow that they do not all engage in such activity in the same way. \nWhile traditionally there was no word in the Wola language equivalent to \u201ework\u201f, this \nchanged with the coming of Europeans, keen to impart their obsession with work as the way \nto \u201edevelopment\u201f.  The result was the neologism kongon, of uncertain etymology.  It might \nderive from pidgin kongkong for a Chinese person, as Chinese were often labourers in the \ncolonial era.\n 26\n  It came into currency when the Australian colonial authorities required people \nto maintain paths in good repair for the passage of government patrols that came up from the \nKutubu lakeside patrol post \u2013 maintain bridges, put log walkways across swampy areas, clear \nbush back etc. \u2013 in addition to building and up-keeping houses for the use of patrols.  A path \nthat leads from the Was to the neighbouring Ak valley, and on to Lake Kutubu, is called \nkongon haeret \u201ework path\u201f.  The term kongon applies to labour demanded by the colonial \nauthorities.  It does not concern tasks people customarily undertake, garden work is not \nkongon, nor is house construction or artefact manufacture.   \n                                                 \n26\n Strathern 1988, p. 179 notes that the Melpa refer to \u201ework\u201f as kongon too, and the word may conceivably have \nfound its way into the Southern Highlands from the Hagen region.  In the previous chapter of the same book she \nsuggests abandoning the term labour and referring to purposive activity in the Hagen region because \u201cthere is no \nobjectification of work apart from its performance . . . work cannot be measured separately of relationships\u201d \n(1988, p. 160). \n 28 \nThe focus of kongon subsequently switched when the administrative headquarters \nmoved to the highlands, to refer to work on the establishment and maintenance of four-wheel \ndrive tracks as directed by the colonial authorities, and initially welcomed by people as \nevidence of modernisation, linking them up with the wider country.  But they soon came to \nresent the tracks as an imposition, the authorities requiring all able bodied men to work on \nmaintenance (repairing culverts, collecting and breaking up stones, weeding out invading \nplants etc.) all day every Monday \u2013 hence the pidgin term wok Mande \u201eMonday workday\u201f for \nit.  It was irksome work and brought none of the imagined benefits, only allowing patrol \nofficers and missionaries easier access to settlements, and occasionally the former would \nstage a spot check of workers and sentence any not present to a spell in prison.  The word \nkongon \u201ework\u201f acquired an unpleasant resonance, more akin to \u201ecorv\u00e9e labour\u201f in English \nthan \u201eremunerated labour\u201f, and associated in people\u201fs minds with kalabus (Pidgin for \n\u201eprison\u201f); all foreign concepts in a stateless order.  This was a brief interval in the region\u201fs \nrecent history; many of the tracks have now disappeared, people ceasing maintenance work as \nsoon as the overseeing stopped, and surrounding vegetation soon covered them over, leaving \nonly footpaths.  They concluded that they brought them no advantage, so why work \nmaintaining them for the few persons who had access to vehicles to use occasionally?  \nNowadays, where vehicular tracks exist, men are as likely to charge drivers using them, for \nexample to cross a bridge that they have maintained \u2013 such informal tolls making it worth \ntheir efforts.  But the word kongon remains as a colonial legacy, for disagreeable labour, \nincluding waged work elsewhere such as the monotonous work demanded of migrant \nlabourers on plantations.  The impact of missionaries on work practices and ideology in the \nWas valley has been relatively limited in comparison, in that, for example, nothing equivalent \nto the Protestant work ethic has taken root; albeit one can perhaps detect efforts to introduce it \nin the mission inspired neologisms for the four days of the week from Monday to Thursday, \n 29 \nwhich all feature the prefix kongon \u201ework\u201f.  Interestingly, the Orokaiva, who traditionally also \nhad no spoken concept equivalent to work, equate its colonial arrival with Jesus Christ \n(Schwimmer 1979, p. 287), although the implications of this are unclear, that is whether \nwork, like Christ, is the salvation of the Orokaiva, or whether it is a Euro-American \nimposition disturbing local ways.   \nThose who propose to distinguish work as activity that results in material outcomes - \nsuch as those who argue for women\u201fs exploitation in the New Guinea Highlands - bring to \nmind Adam Smith\u201fs distinction between productive and unproductive labour.  In his words, \n\u201cThere is one sort of labour which adds to the value of the subject upon which it is bestowed: \nthere is another which has no effect.  The former, as it produces a value, may be called \nproductive; the latter, unproductive labour\u201d (Smith 1993, p. 67).  According to this \ndistinction, some Wola activities such as gardening are productive, while others such as \nexchange are not.  This way of thinking has given rise to, and continually reinforces, the \nnarrow notion, either explicitly or implicitly, that work concerns the provision of material \ngoods, which leads to some confusion.  Economists carried related assumptions over into the \n20\nth\n century but whereas they broadened their horizons long ago, many anthropologists \ncontinue (some openly, others less obviously) to equate work and the economy with activities \nthat secure the material means of human existence.\n27\n  The Wola apparently are under no such \nmisapprehension.   \nIn a market economy some people work on farms and in factories and produce goods \nin return for wages, and the objects of their labour are assigned prices and sold, while others \nreceive an income for engaging in activities with no material outcome, such as academics, \npoliticians, civil servants, lawyers and armed service personnel.  (It is debatable whether the \n                                                 \n27\n It is the existence of money in our society that shows the productive and unproductive labour distinction is \nunhelpful, the receipt of a wage defining an activity as work.  Individuals are contributing something to earn \nmoney, and cash has subsistence connections in that we all use a part of our incomes for this purpose.   \n 30 \n\u201eunproductive\u201f occupations exploit the \u201eproductive\u201f ones, as some Marxists argue, an issue \nthat requires some yardstick to measure effort against income, which can also accommodate \nthe different skills and experience that individuals bring to their work \u2013 complex issues that \ntake us way beyond the straightforward point made here.)  In a similar vein, it is reasonable \nfor the Wola to equate time spent on cultivation tasks with that engaging in socio-political \nexchange transactions , taking part in disputes, and if these get out of hand, taking up arms in \nhostilities; these three activities comparing directly with the work of politicians, lawyers and \nsoldiers.   \nThe Wola lexicon suggests that the idea of labelling some activities as work is a \nforeign one.  The comments of people on their activities confirm this impression.  They point \nout that the activities of both women and men contribute to their well-being.  While women \nmay spend more time engaged in cultivation, men invest considerable effort, they say, in \narranging and taking part in exchanges, sometimes walking long distances to do so.  In \nportraying transaction as equally \u201ework\u201f, we can draw parallels with banking and insurance in \ncapitalist economies, both of which involve income earning work, when they too yield \nnothing tangible in way of products.  In this regard, I think that it is a misconception to \ncharacterise exchange as \u201csocial face-work . . . a cushy and enjoyable activity\u201d, as a reviewer \nof this paper put it.  Men experience considerable stress in meeting their transactional \ncommitments.  They often talk about their worries and the immense efforts they are making to \nfind sufficient valuables to meet forthcoming obligations.  It demands effort to build up both \nwealth and relationships, and secure one\u201fs status.   \nThis etymological discussion further challenges the propriety of the widely used \nproduction versus transaction dichotomy that I have employed as a heuristic device in \nprevious work, the Wola making no such distinction verbally to my knowledge.  It appears \ntoo blunt, even distorting in the light of the evidence cited here.  The extensive vocabulary \n 31 \nthey have for various productive tasks and different exchange transactions uses bay \u201edoing\u201f to \nrefer to activities that occur in both domains\u2013 for example on the production side aend ka bay \n(to lash roof lathes in place) and paip pat bay (to split fence stakes), and on the transaction \nside injiykab sayak bay (to make a contribution to a bridewealth) and moraeret bay (the \nreparation exchange sequence) \u2013 which suggests that they consider both production and \ntransaction endeavours equally as activities, whether we call them work or not.   \nFurthermore, the effort expended on transactions intimates that men have to work to \nmaintain social order.  If they fail, they may be embroiled in violence.  In relation to the \nquestion of what is work, some men mention that taking part in saend \u201ehostilities\u201f is a \u201estrong\u201f \nactivity.  While they are not continually locked in armed aggression, the potential is ever \npresent, and men are obliged to ensure the safety of their families; they are rarely without bow \nand arrows, or today rifle of some description.  Women do not bear arms and engage in \nhostilities, although they are sometimes caught up in the violence.  In times of armed \nhostilities, although they are not engaged in fighting every day, men expend considerable \nenergy, constantly alert checking for surprise raids and ambushes.  It requires effort and skill \naimed at securing certain outcomes.  The parallel with armed forces in capitalist nations is \nclear, where service personnel earn incomes, again for producing nothing tangible.  The time \nexpenditure survey misses armed hostilities, conducted when none occurred in the Was valley \nregion; following independence it was several years before the stateless order reasserted itself \nwith open violence.  Similarly, all the ethnography that has considered how women and men \nspend their time comes from the era of colonially imposed peace or soon after it, and omits to \ngive armed hostilities due attention.   \nIn relation to the behaviour documented in the time expenditure survey, it appears that \nwe have two classes of activity: generic bay \u201edo\u201f activity and, in contrast to it, rest, which \nmay be horshiyow beray literally \u201erelax sit\u201f, or uwpaelay \u201esleep\u201f.  This challenges the view of \n 32 \nMalinowski (1929, p. 33), in the paper quoted earlier, who asserts that \u201cTo identify labour \nwith activity in general as has been done recently in a somewhat unsatisfactory text-book on \nPrimitive Labour by L. H. Buxton is incorrect, for there are various activities, above all play \nand games, which are not labour in the economic sense\u201d.  It seems that Buxton was right from \na Wola perspective, either all activity is labour or none is.  We find Gell (1992, p. 211) taking \nthe same position more recently where he wants to \u201cdeny that there is such a thing as \u201efree\u201f \ntime at all.  Something is always being \u201eproduced\u201f, even if it is only \u201econversation\u201f or \n\u201esleep\u201f\u201d.  The derivation of the word kongon is instructive, especially in contrast to the use of \nthe ubiquitous bay verb.  It suggests that to identify labour in some daily activities, and \ndistinguish them from others as work, distorts the import of Wola behaviour and ideas.  \nPanoff (1977) makes a similar point for the Maenge, that they do not distinguish \u201eproductive\u201f \nfrom other activities (including eating, sleeping, etc.).  They challenge the assumption dating \nfrom the classical economic thinkers such as Marx (1994, p. 227) that labour, \u201cas the creator \nof use-values, as useful labour, is a condition of human existence which is independent of all \nforms of society . . . Use-values . . . the physical bodies of commodities, are combinations of \ntwo elements, the material provided by nature, and labour\u201d.   \nA reviewer, who identified himself as a critical \u201efemo-marxist\u201f and materialist, pointed \nout that while Marx\u201fs argument about labour and use-value is only a conceptual reality within \nparticular social formations (with the emergence of wage labour and commodity exchange), \nand so are not universal categories understood everywhere, nonetheless they are \u201canalytic (i.e. \netic) categories applicable (from our perspective) to all societies\u201d.  He accuses me of \nerroneously criticising this \u201eetic\u201f theoretical perspective from an \u201eemic\u201f local one.  After all, \nMarx never said that workers would recognise their exploitation, for \u201cexploitation is an \nobjective matter, not a question of local recognition\u201d.  Consequently, we can identify it \nanywhere.  But only if we agree which activities qualify as labour and which do not.  If you \n 33 \nspecify only those activities that have material subsistence related outcomes as involving \nlabour, and if you find that certain persons undertake more of these activities than others, \nthen, as I have previously conceded, you might perhaps talk of exploitation.  If it does not \nreflect people\u201fs way of classifying their activities, they will of necessity, from this \nperspective, be labouring under a \u201efalse consciousness\u201f.  But you are not applying some \nuniversal and unchallengeable definition of labour, and if their classification of activities \nundercuts it, this must surely question the applicability of this definition and your subjective \ncharacterization of exploitation. \nIt is to force our categories and ideas on others to assume that labour must similarly be seen as \nthe source of values and wealth elsewhere, such as in the New Guinea highlands.  It results in \ninappropriate enquiries, such as attempts to calculate the labour value contributed by people \nto the things they produce (e.g. Godelier 1969; Modjeska 1985).\n28\n  As Arendt (1998, p. 105) \nputs it, \u201cthe question arises why Locke and all his successors, their own insights \nnotwithstanding, clung so obstinately to labour as the origin of property, of wealth, or all \nvalues and, finally, of the very humanity of man.  Or, to put it another way, what were the \nexperiences inherent in the labouring activity that proved of such great importance to the \nmodern age?\u201d29  The answer in part relates to the peculiar property relations and focus on \nmaterial possessions that dominate the capitalist order, viewed as the products of labour, \nwhich contrast strongly with a focus on possessing things to give to others as in the Wola \norder, where it is the obviation of labour, I argue, particularly in relation to things of value, \nwhich is central to the polity (see Sillitoe 2003, pp. 309-12 for discussion of implications in \nrelation to pig keeping). \n                                                 \n28\n The Baruya comment that work is something they forget as it belongs to the past (which is puzzling in \napplying the labour theory of value - Godelier 1977, p. 146), fits in with the interpretation ventured here. \n29\n While this paper draws on Arendt\u201fs (1998) phenomenological discussion of activity, it questions the \ndistinction, which draws on deep-rooted European assumptions, between three forms of activity as fundamental \nto the human condition, namely biological labour, cultural work, and social action. \n 34 \nWorking for equality \nWhile time is limited for all of us, the evidence suggests that the Wola do not think \nthat this poses a problem for labour.  Indeed they do not distinguish labour, defined as work to \nproduce something, from life\u201fs other activities, and their approach to these generally is \nrelaxed and does not evidence the pressure we experience in capitalist society with its \nperception of time as in short supply.  They are not exceptional in this respect, as Wallman \n(1979, p. 10) notes in a comparative context, there are cultures where \u201cno time cost is \ncomputed \u2013 i.e. time, as such, appears to have no value\u201d which limits the use of \u201ctime as a \nmeasure of value\u201d.  Consequently, it is questionable to view the sexual division of labour as a \ngendered arrangement of exploitation because women spend time on certain tasks (often with \nmaterial outcomes), and men on others (often with immaterial outcomes).  Both women and \nmen engage in necessary and counterpart activities, they complement one another in a \npolitical-economic partnership that is central to the stateless constitution where the values of \npersonal autonomy and equality are paramount (Sillitoe 1985).  This complementarity is quite \ndifferent to relations between bosses and workers, a comparison made by a referee of this \npaper, as neither party employs the other.  There is also a moral dimension to the sexual \ndivision of labour regarding relations between persons.  Gendered activity roles pertain to \nrights and responsibilities, tasks undertaken with respect to others are an acknowledgement of \nrelationships of which they comprise a significant aspect, although I should not go so far as \nascribing to them aesthetic significance (Demian 2000).   \nOn another tack, the reviewer quoted above seems to agree with this argument, \ncommenting that \u201cunfair relations rest not so much upon what one does, but upon how one \ncomes out of the domestic and extra-domestic transactions that complete the cycle which \nproduction begins\u201d.  Again, in terms of what they produce, both women and men consume \nabout equal amounts, having the same standards of living.  This leaves, from this materialist \n 35 \nperspective, men\u201fs vying for status through participation in socio-political exchanges, which \nmay involve things produced, as defining the unequal relations.  It is here, I argue, that the \ndistinction between transaction and production is unhelpful.  The obfuscation of connections \nbetween these domains, as evident in Wola non-labour distinctions between activities, is \ncritical to the stateless order.  These arrangements prevent anyone seeking to control \nproduction.  It is an aspect of acephalous relations that keeps power out of the reach of any \npersons or groups and makes the subjective capitalist idea of exploitation redundant. \nWe should not allow some men sometimes speaking of women\u201fs activities in a \nderogatory way (or some women, come to that, speaking poorly of their men folks\u201f carryings \non) to deceive us into thinking that this signals or justifies unfair labour arrangements.  There \nis good reason why women and men are taught to shun some of one another\u201fs activities, \nnamely that they do not aspire to interfere and exert control.  While on occasion they may \nundertake tasks normally done by the opposite sex, it is embarrassing to do so; for instance \nmen till soil and plant sweet potato or women cut down cane grass, if their partners desert \nthem for some reason.  People consider it risible for a man to heap sweet potato mounds or a \nwoman to fell trees, and normally adjusted persons do not aspire to do so, unless an unusually \nurgent situation arises.  Nonetheless the sexual division of labour is not inviolable.  One \nwoman known to me refused to move on marriage from her natal place where she participated \nin various exchange transactions like a man, until finally, after the birth of two daughters, her \nhusband tired of her behaviour and married a second wife and went to live elsewhere, leaving \nhis first wife to what he considered her own eccentric devices.  I also know men who have \nremained bachelors all their lives,\n30\n who net their own bags and sometimes till soil in their \ngardens; I was told that they remain youthful for many years as they do not expose themselves \nto the debilitating consequences of sexual congress (see Bowers 1965 on bachelorhood in the \n                                                 \n30\n These are not inadequate or retarded men called ol dimb, who invariably do not marry either. \n 36 \nKaugel valley).  Such persons are rare, and they are tolerated, if thought odd, even pitied for \ntheir eccentricity.  Before we applaud such behaviour for challenging the established order, in \nthe name for instance of female emancipation, we should consider the implications of the \narrangements for egalitarian relations.   \nThe ancestors of those living in the Was valley evolved certain patterns of behaviour \nto accommodate certain values, one of which I think is equality (which is not to imply that \nideals necessarily have priority over material issues, as any political-economic order has to \naccommodate both).  While women and men often engage in different activities, this does not \nsignal unfair relations but the occupation of different and complementary socio-political \npositions necessary to the egalitarian constitution.  Both occupy key domains.  They comprise \na partnership, relying on each other.  The implications of the partnership, I argue, extend \nbeyond the family and homestead to the wider community in the Was valley because the \ndivision of labour is a key feature of the acephalous polity.  The gender difference in \ncontributions to \u201eproductive\u201f and \u201eunproductive\u201f tasks is necessary to the constitution of the \nstateless order.  The engagement of men in wealth transactions and armed hostilities, which \nrepresent the positive and negative sides of political interaction, suggest a further reason why \nthey may not be relied upon to undertake the routine activities involved in gardening, such as \ntilling the soil, planting and harvesting many crops.  Sometimes engaged elsewhere either in \nexchanges or fighting, families would go without on occasion if they depended on them, \nwhereas they can rely on them to undertake irregular heavy work that they can do in bursts of \nactivity, such as clearing and fencing gardens.   \nThe sexual division of labour that features here, serving egalitarian arrangements, is \nquite different to the occupational division of labour that supports social hierarchy, such as the \ncapitalist class system.  As I have argued elsewhere (Sillitoe 2001), in relation to pig keeping: \n\u201cFar from featuring exploitation, labour arrangements are frustrating it.  The structural \n 37 \nimplications for the egalitarian Wola polity are considerable.  If we apply the logic of western \ncapitalist or Marxist thinking . . .  we should expect persons to attempt to exert some control \nover the production of pigs.  . . .  It would be a short step from controlling one aspect of life, \nsuch as pig production, to seeking to extend the attendant authority to others.  The structuring \nof labour relations between women and men in pig production is one of the many aspects of \nWola life that make capitalist or marxist logic redundant.\u201d  And the defence of individual \nautonomy that I think central to their polity applies equally to both women and men.  There \nare countless instances of women acting freely against the interests of husbands and other \nmale relatives.  For example, wives tired of their husbands\u201f behaviour moving away to join \ntheir brother\u201fs or son\u201fs homesteads, and daughters forcing their father\u201fs hand in a marriage by \nthreatening to elope or even doing so.  And those few rebels or oddballs with a mind to can, \nas noted, undertake activities normally assumed by the opposite sex.   \n \nREFERENCES  \nArendt, H.
