Absolute\ngravity and geological information from late Holocene sea level data further constrain the\nvertical motion estimates. For 40 CGPS stations we estimate station velocities and associated\nuncertainties using maximum likelihood estimation, assuming the presence of white and\ncoloured noise. Horizontal station velocity estimates agree to <1 mm yr\u22121 between the two\nCGPS processing strategies and closely follow predicted plate motions. Residual velocities,\ngenerally <1 mm yr\u22121, follow no regular pattern, that is, there is no discernible internal\ndeformation, nor any dependence on station monumentation or time-series length. Vertical\nstation velocity estimates for the two CGPS processing strategies agree to \u223c1 mm yr\u22121,\nbut show an offset of \u223c1 mm yr\u22121 with respect to the absolute gravity (AG) estimates. We\nattribute this offset to a bias related to known issues in current CGPS results and correct for\nit by AG-alignment of our CGPS estimates of vertical station velocity. Both CGPS estimates\nand AG-aligned CGPS estimates of present-day vertical crustal motions confirm the pattern\nof subsidence and uplift in Great Britain derived from Holocene sea level data for the last\nfew thousand years: ongoing subsidence on Shetland, uplift in most areas of Scotland, and\nsubsidence in large areas of England and Wales.\nKey words: Time series analysis; Satellite geodesy; Time variable gravity; Plate motions;\nEurope.\n1 INTRODUCTION\n1.1 Context\nThere are two large-scale geophysical processes known to cause\ncrustal motions in Great Britain. The first, the motion of the Eurasian\nplate due to plate tectonics, predominantly acts on the horizontal\ncoordinate components with negligible effect on the vertical. The\nsecond, known as glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA), is the on-going\nviscous response of the solid Earth to past changes in ice sheets and\nsea level. This process contributes a signal in both the vertical and\nhorizontal components (e.g. Mitrovica et al. 1994; Milne et al. 2001,\n2006).\n\u2217Now at: Department of Earth Sciences, University of Ottawa, Canada.\nThe plate tectonics signal in Great Britain, a rotation along with\nthe Eurasian plate, is seen as motion in a northeasterly direction of\napproximately 23 mm yr\u22121. Great Britain is considered part of the\nrigid interior of the Eurasian plate, although some residual motion of\nsoutheast England with respect to central Europe has been reported\npreviously (Nocquet et al. 2001; Nocquet & Calais 2003). Apart\nfrom this, there have been few studies concerned with the plate\nmotion signal or the stability of the plate within Great Britain due\nto a lack of geodetic data.\nIn contrast to plate motions, the GIA signal has been studied\nin great detail in the area of Great Britain. The majority of stud-\nies to date have considered only the sea level aspect of the GIA\nsignal (e.g. Lambeck 1993a,b; Lambeck et al. 1996; Peltier et al.\n2002; Shennan et al. 2002). As the precision of geodetic constraints\nfrom continuous global positioning system (CGPS) measurements\nhave improved, these data have been employed more recently in\nGIA modelling studies (e.g. Milne et al. 2006). With regard to the\nC\u00a9 2009 The Authors 23\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2009 RAS\n24 F. N. Teferle et al.\ncrustal motion signal recorded by CGPS, the data provide a good\ntest of the models through the summation of both the near and\nfar-field effects. In general, the signal manifests itself as a combi-\nnation of the effects related to the deglaciation of the Laurentide,\nFennoscandian and the British\u2013Irish ice sheets (Milne et al. 2006).\nFor the horizontal components, the dominant signal is associated\nwith the Laurentide ice sheet and is predicted to be in a northwest-\nerly direction. The magnitude of the horizontal GIA signal varies\nacross the region and is thought to be of the order of 1\u20132 mm yr\u22121\n(Milne et al. 2006). For the vertical component, the dominant signal\nis associated with the British\u2013Irish ice sheet and the adjacent, sig-\nnificantly larger Fennoscandian ice sheet, resulting in subsidence\non Shetland, uplift in most areas of Scotland, and subsidence in\nlarge areas of England and Wales. Prior to the availability of CGPS\nmeasurements, vertical crustal motion was inferred from geological\ninformation of relative sea level change, inverted to form maps of\nHolocene crustal movements (Shennan 1989; Shennan & Horton\n2002; Shennan et al. 2006). As changes in sea level around Great\nBritain are of major concern, it is this geological information which\nhas so far been used to correct tide gauge (TG) records for changes\nin land levels (e.g. Woodworth et al. 1999).\nOn a local scale, past crustal motions occurred along the main\nfault systems in Scotland (e.g. Curry 1986; Canning et al. 1998;\nStewart et al. 2001), but these motions are believed to have largely\nceased. Whereas, more recent neotectonic crustal motions have been\nreported for London in southeast England (Ellison et al. 2004).\nSimilarly, in some areas we may also expect to see subsidence\nassociated with sediment compaction (e.g. Zong & Tooley 1996;\nShennan & Horton 2002; Edwards 2006; Hill et al. 2007) and\nthe extended deep mining activities throughout the Anthropocene\n(e.g. Humphries 2001; Bell et al. 2005; Donnelly 2006). Although\nit is worth noting that most deep mining ended in the 1980s and the\ncurrent geodetic monitoring network of CGPS and absolute gravity\n(AG) stations were established in the late 1990s.\nFor many years the only CGPS station in Great Britain was located\nat Herstmonceux in southeast England. In the late 1990s other CGPS\nstations were established, predominantly at sites of the national TG\nnetwork. The main objective of these was to measure the vertical\nland motions directly at the TG sites (Teferle et al. 2002, 2006;\nTeferle 2003). We note here that such CGPS@TG stations may not\nonly be affected by large-scale vertical crustal motions and local\nscale subsidence, but also by local instabilities, as these stations are\noften founded on structures such as piers and quays of varying age\nand foundations.\nInitially the CGPS network grew slowly, as expansion was\nmainly driven by various scientific objectives, similar to those in\nScandinavia (e.g. Milne et al. 2001; Johansson et al. 2002;\nLidberg et al. 2007) . However, since the year 2000, a larger number\nof CGPS stations were established as network real-time kinematic\n(RTK) CGPS stations, but mainly located on buildings.\nTo advance sea level research, in the late 1990s three AG sta-\ntions were also established near TGs (Williams et al. 2001). In\ncontrast to the CGPS@TG stations, these were located in build-\nings believed to be founded on bedrock, thus providing estimates\nof vertical crustal motions. That AG is an essential technique when\ninvestigating such motions has been shown previously (e.g. Larson\n& van Dam 2000; Lambert et al. 2001; Mazzotti et al. 2007). In\nterms of accuracy, the role of AG is also becoming critical for the\nvertical component, as a geodetic technique independent of the In-\nternational Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF), namely ITRF2000\n(Altamimi et al. 2002) and its update ITRF2005 (Altamimi\net al. 2007).\nAlthough much work has been undertaken to improve the preci-\nsion of vertical crustal motions from CGPS, the absolute accuracy\nof these is currently still limited by the accuracy of the ITRF, which\nis \u223c2 mm yr\u22121 in the vertical. This limitation stems from difficulties\nin the accurate determination of the geocentre of the ITRF and its\nlong-term motion with respect to the centre of mass (CM) of the\nEarth system (e.g. Wu et al. 2002; Blewitt 2003; Dong et al. 2003;\nArgus 2007).\nIn recent discussions, the accuracy of horizontal crustal motions\nfrom CGPS has also been questioned. These may only be accurate\nat the 1\u20132 mm yr\u22121 level due to the implementation of the no-net ro-\ntation condition in ITRF2000 and ITRF2005 (Kreemer et al. 2006;\nAltamimi et al. 2007). Additionally, estimates from regional real-\nizations of the terrestrial reference frame, still implemented in many\nstudies, may be biased\/offset, depending on the subset of reference\nframe sites used for the regional reference frame implementation\n(Dong et al. 2003; Mazzotti et al. 2008).\nIn response to these issues, Aoki & Scholz (2003) computed\nabsolute vertical station velocities by alignment of their CGPS esti-\nmates to those estimated at 18 TGs in the Japanese Islands, assuming\na global averaged sea level rise of 1.8 mm yr\u22121. Caccamise et al.\n(2005) reported only relative and not absolute vertical station veloc-\nity estimates between several CGPS stations in Hawaii, and Bennett\n& Hreinsdo\u00b4ttir (2007) determined a local vertical reference frame\nusing Holocene and Late Pleistocene geological evidence of ver-\ntical crustal motions. A similar, but alternative approach has been\nadvocated for the CGPS@TG stations in Great Britain based on an\nalignment of the CGPS vertical station velocity estimates to those\nfrom AG (Teferle 2003; Teferle et al. 2006). The advantage of this\napproach lies in the nature of these two complementary geodetic\ntechniques giving independent estimates over a comparable time\nspan if operated in parallel.\nIn addition to problems with the terrestrial reference frame, it\nis well known that CGPS coordinate solutions suffer from residual\nerrors due to inaccurate models of systematic biases both directly,\nwhen these are applied by the user, and indirectly through the use\nof GPS satellite orbit and clock, and Earth rotation products. For\nexample, significant effects on the vertical coordinate component\nhave been reported due to inadequate modelling of satellite and re-\nceiver antenna phase centres (e.g. Ge et al. 2005; Cardellach et al.\n2007), the neglecting of higher-order ionospheric terms (Kedar et al.\n2003; Fritsche et al. 2005; Herna\u00b4ndez-Pajares et al. 2007), the in-\nadequate modelling of the tropospheric delay (e.g. Bo\u00a8hm et al.\n2006; Vey et al. 2006), and the effect of different loading processes\n(e.g. van Dam et al. 2001; Tregoning & Van Dam 2005). The bene-\nfits of improved models from some of this recent research have been\ndemonstrated in a re-analysis of global CGPS data set for the pe-\nriod between 1994 and 2005 (Steigenberger et al. 2006). However,\nsuch improved models are not always readily available to users of\ndifferent GPS software, or accounted for in the current GPS satel-\nlite orbit and clock, and Earth rotation products available from the\nInternational GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) Service\n(IGS; Beutler et al. 1999).\nAll of these biases are in part responsible for the increased day-to-\nday scatter in the vertical component of CGPS coordinate solutions\nand lead to a loss in precision and accuracy. However, as some of\nthese effects have similar magnitudes over large areas, they can of-\nten be identified as common mode biases (Wdowinski et al. 1997).\nHence, by using spatial filtering the common mode can success-\nfully be removed, reducing the day-to-day scatter and improving the\nerror bounds of parameter estimates (e.g. Wdowinski et al. 1997; Jo-\nhansson et al. 2002; Nikolaidis 2002; Dong et al. 2006). Although,\nC\u00a9 2009 The Authors, GJI, 178, 23\u201346\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2009 RAS\nCrustal motions in Great Britain 25\nspatial filtering may also de-couple station velocity estimates from\nthe reference frame of the coordinate solutions (Wdowinski et al.\n1997, 2004).\nBesides obtaining highly accurate station velocity estimates, it\nis essential that a realistic uncertainty is assigned to any estimate.\nFor example, several authors (Langbein & Johnson 1997; Zhang\net al. 1997; Mao et al. 1999; Williams 2003; Williams et al. 2004)\nhave shown that CGPS coordinate time-series contain both white\nand coloured noise, that is, time-independent and time-correlated\nnoise, and if coloured noise is not accounted for station velocity\nuncertainties may be underestimated by an order of magnitude.\n1.2 Aims\nTeferle et al. (2006) compared the CGPS estimates of vertical land\nmotions obtained for seven CGPS@TG stations to those from AG,\ngeological information, sea level records, and GIA models, and\nfound the CGPS estimates to be offset. Their CGPS estimates were\ntoo positive, or less negative, than the other estimates ergo they\nused a combination of CGPS and AG to align the CGPS estimates\nto their AG estimates at Newlyn and Lerwick. This study is partly\nan update of the work of Williams et al. (2001) and Teferle et al.\n(2006), but more so an expansion of it in four different ways.\n(i) We introduce a second and independent CGPS processing\nstrategy using the Bernese GPS software version 5.0 (Dach et al.\n2007) in precise point positioning mode (Teferle et al. 2007).\n(ii) We expand our reference frame implementation from re-\ngional (European) to global.\n(iii) We include more CGPS stations in Great Britain, to get\nbetter coverage.\n(iv) We make improvements to the spatial filtering used in Teferle\net al. (2006) to avoid, as much as possible, a de-coupling of our sta-\ntion velocity estimates from our reference frame implementations.\nThrough this expansion and the inclusion of more recent data we\npresent the followings:\n(i) Updated vertical station velocity estimates from the expanded\nCGPS network and AG.\n(ii) Horizontal station velocity estimates (and residual velocities)\nfor the expanded CGPS network.\n(iii) AG-aligned CGPS estimates of vertical crustal motions for\nthe expanded CGPS network, and a comparison of these with esti-\nmates from geological information.\n(iv) Initial maps of vertical crustal motion for Great Britain based\non geodetic data.\nThe expansion of the CGPS network brought about the inclu-\nsion of stations with very different monumentation, often a priori\ndeemed inappropriate for geophysical interpretation. Here we fol-\nlow the approach of previous studies (e.g. Calais et al. 2006) and\ninclude such stations, then look at their suitability a posteriori.\nIn this way, we provide the horizontal and vertical station veloc-\nity estimates which form the basis for the studies of Woodworth\net al. (2009) to update the trends in sea level changes around Great\nBritain, and of Bradley et al. (2009), who investigate the modelling\nof the GIA processes observed in this region.\n1.3 Method\nIn the following section we discuss the available data sets, that is,\nfrom CGPS, AG, and geological information. This is followed by\na description of the processing and analysis of the CGPS, AG and\ngeological data before we present our results. For CGPS, we com-\npare our horizontal and vertical station velocity estimates in order\nto quantify the effects of our two independent CGPS processing\nstrategies, spatial filtering, and reference frame implementations.\nFor AG, we show our best estimates for the change in gravity and\nderive AG estimates of vertical station velocities from them. The\nvelocity estimates from both geodetic techniques are then inter-\npreted as crustal motions under the assumption that no other local\ndisplacement has occurred. For the horizontal component, we then\ninvestigate which CGPS stations seem promising for future geo-\nphysical interpretations. For the vertical component, we compare\nour CGPS estimates to those from AG, compute AG-aligned CGPS\nestimates of vertical crustal motions, and compare these to the lat-\nest geological information. Through this process we establish sets\nof stations for which we have confidence that their station velocity\nestimates represent present-day crustal motions in Great Britain.\n2 DATA SETS\n2.1 Continuous GPS\nThe CGPS stations in Great Britain can be divided into two cate-\ngories: scientific and network RTK.

N. Teferle et al.\nNPLD at the National Physical Laboratory in Teddington, west of\nLondon, contribute to both the IGS and the European Reference\nFrame Permanent Network (EPN; Bruyninx et al. 2001). The sci-\nentific CGPS station NEWL in Newlyn, southwest England and\nABER in Aberdeen, eastern Scotland, contribute to the IGS TG\nBenchmark Monitoring (TIGA) Pilot-Project and the European Sea\nLevel Service (ESEAS). NEWL and the two network RTK stations\nINVE in Inverness, northern Scotland and DARE in Daresbury,\nnorthwest England, also contribute to the EPN.\nEstablished in 1992, HERS is the longest operating CGPS sta-\ntion in Great Britain, but its data quality suffered during the\n1990s and we regard this station to be of highest quality only af-\nter 2001. MORP is certainly an interesting CGPS station within\nthe IGS network due to its unique monumentation, a 4.5 tonne\ncarved monolith that rests directly on top of the underlying\nbedrock (Blewitt et al. 1997). Again, this station suffered from\npoor data quality in the late 1990s (Teferle 2003), which im-\nproved only after modifications in 2002 (IGSMAIL-4222 (2002),\nsee http:\/\/igscb.jpl.nasa.gov\/mail\/igsmail\/igsmail.html).\nWithin BIGF the scientific CGPS stations include those es-\ntablished at ten of the 44 TGs which form the national TG\nnetwork as part of the National Tidal and Sea Level Facility\n(http:\/\/www.pol.ac.uk\/ntslf), 12 others established at sites of the\nUK Meteorological Office (UKMO) or the Environment Agency\n(EA), and one at the University of Nottingham. All of these were\nestablished during the period from 1997 to 2005 (Table 1).\nThe CGPS@TG stations have GPS receivers housed in the same\nbuilding as the TG equipment and the GPS antennas mounted on\nmonuments, sited as close as possible to the TG, i.e. within a few\nmeters of the TG itself; to fulfil the requirement for site-specific,\ndirect estimates of the changes in land level. Teferle (2003) gives\nfurther details of these CGPS@TG stations. Due to our interest in\nsea level studies, we have also included the IGS\/EPN station BRST\nlocated close to the TG at Brest, France, in our analysis, and we\nwill list it along with the ten CGPS@TG stations located in Great\nBritain.\nThe network RTK CGPS stations in Great Britain that are\narchived in BIGF belong to the Ordnance Survey of Great Britain\n(OSGB), who have established over 120 such stations since 2000,\nwith larger numbers in more recent years. In this study we only in-\nclude the 16 stations that were established before 2003 and that have\na sufficient and consistent enough data span to warrant any scientific\nanalysis. If they are founded on a stable structure connected to solid\nrock, then they can provide a series of CGPS stations that densifies\nthe sparse network of scientific stations (Fig. 1 and Table 1).\nOverall, we do not consider the CGPS network used in this study\nas homogeneous. However, we point out elements of homogeneity\nin the groups of the scientific CGPS stations and the network RTK\nCGPS stations, which relate to the GPS equipment (Table 1) and the\nstation-specific monumentation (Table 2).\nFrom Table 2 it can be seen that most scientific CGPS stations\nuse IESSG-designed carbon-fibre poles with stainless steel ends\nthat have been attached to either a solid structure or a submerged\nconcrete block that rests directly on top of bedrock, whereas almost\nall network RTK CGPS stations are located on brick buildings\nwith varying number of storeys. For these stations the monument\nnormally consists of a stainless steel tripod on the roof, or a bracket,\nwhich has been mounted on the roof or onto a wall, with the antenna\nreaching above the roof.\nAlthough HEMS was used for scientific investigations in the past\n(Teferle et al. 2002), the station was decommissioned in 2001 and is\nmentioned here only for completeness. As DVTG, LWTG, SWTG\nand UIST were only established in 2005, their coordinate time-series\nare still too short and we do not discuss these sites further.\n2.2 Absolute gravity\nAG measurements near TGs began in 1995 at Newlyn and Aberdeen\nand in 1996 at Lerwick (Williams et al. 2001). Given the complexity\nin making AG measurements we decided to focus our attention on\nthree TG sites. The sites were selected based on their geographical\ndistribution and their representation of the expected changes in\nland level due to GIA, that is, subsidence at Newlyn in southwest\nEngland, uplift or no movement at Aberdeen in eastern Scotland\nand subsidence at Lerwick on Shetland. Newlyn and Lerwick TGs\ncontribute to the Global Sea Level Observing System (GLOSS)\ncoordinated by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission\n(IOC) and Newlyn and Aberdeen both have some of the longest and\nhighest quality mean sea level time-series in the country (Williams\net al. 2001).\nAt each TG a detailed reconnaissance was carried out to identify\npotential sites for the establishment of an AG station considered\nsuitable for the long-term monitoring of vertical crustal motion.\nThe main criterion for an AG station is location within a building\n(for a stable and protected environment) that is likely to have a secure\nfuture, with little or no change to its surrounding environment over\na sufficient period of time, and built on a bedrock foundation. There\nare certain effects that restrict the station from being placed at\nthe TG or close to the coastline. The direct gravitational attraction\nof the ocean mass changes (tidal and non-tidal) close to the TG\nwould impart unwanted noise into the measurements if they are\nnot modelled sufficiently, and it would be difficult to interpret the\ngravity changes as such. For example, the conversion factor to apply\ndepends on the source of the land movements, that is, free-air for\na subsiding pier or Bouguer for a GIA signal. The AG station was,\ntherefore, established sufficiently far from the coastline to minimize\nthese effects while still representing the motion at the TG.\nLerwick AG station is located in the basement of a school, about\n0.5 km from the TG and the CGPS@TG station LWTG and 5 km\nfrom the scientific CGPS station LERW; Aberdeen AG station is\nlocated in a church, about 3.2 km from the TG and the CGPS@TG\nstation ABER; and Newlyn AG station is located in the church at\nPaul about 1.5 km from the TG and the CGPS@TG station NEWL.\nWe show the locations of AG stations used in this study in Fig. 1.\nAG measurements are made by dropping a mass in a vacuum and\nusing an Iodine stabilized He\u2013Ne laser interferometer and rubidium\natomic clock to obtain distance\u2013time pairs and solve the equations\nof motion to obtain the acceleration (Niebauer et al. 1995). We use\nthe POL absolute gravimeter (FG5-103), produced commercially by\nMicro-g LaCoste Inc., USA, to make our measurements. Measure-\nment campaigns at each station are made approximately annually\nover duration of three to four days. The instrument is set up at the\nstart of each day and the measurements consist of 24 hourly sets of\n200 drops spaced 10 s apart. Occasionally, if the measurements do\nnot go as planned, a second trip to the station is organized. Prior\nto and after each field visit, measurements are made at the gravity\nstation in the laboratory and compared with measurements from our\nsecond instrument (FG5-222), to ensure the measurements are con-\nsistent. In addition, both instruments are regularly intercompared\nwith other instruments in Europe and the USA to ensure that they\nare in agreement at the 1\u20132\u03bcGal level (Williams et al. 2001; Vi-\ntushkin et al. 2002; Francis et al. 2005).

Observations, with quantified\nuncertainty terms, of past changes in sea level relative to present\ncome from sediments, both organic and minerogenic, and from\nmorphological features whose origin was controlled by palaeo-sea\nlevel. In order to be useful, sediments must not have been eroded\nor transported since the time of accumulation and where such sed-\niments and morphological features survive, they can be used as\nsea level index points by defining attributes such as location, age,\naltitude and tendency (Shennan et al. 2006). If no transportation\nof the sediments can be assumed, then the location attribute of a\nsea level index point is defined by its geographical coordinates.\nThe age attribute is obtained from radiocarbon techniques with\ncalibrated ages as 95 per cent confidence limits using Calib 4.4\n(http:\/\/depts.washington.edu\/qil). We wish to mention that most sea\nlevel index points in the database from Great Britain have at least one\ntype of corroborating evidence to support the radiocarbon age and to\ndemonstrate continuity of sedimentation. The ages of most sea level\nindex points range between 3000 and 10 000 calibrated years before\npresent (cal. yr BP), with some sites in northwest Scotland having\nthe longest records dating back to up to 15 000 cal. yr BP. With\nvery few locations worldwide providing such long (>10 000 year)\nrecords of relative sea level change, these are key to determining\nchanges in global ice volume (Shennan et al. 2006). We show the\nsea level index points from Shennan & Horton (2002) used in this\nstudy in Fig. 1 and list associated information in Table 4.\n3 PROCESS ING AND ANALYS IS\n3.1 Continuous GPS\nWe utilized two independent CGPS processing strategies during our\nanalysis of the daily GPS observation data from Great Britain and\nour reference frame networks. Following the examples of Geirsson\net al. (2006) and Kierulf et al. (2008), by having multiple indepen-\ndent solutions (softwares\/strategies) we are able to better understand\nprocessing strategy specific issues which may be of station-specific\nor solution-specific character. As we will show, at this stage it is\nimportant for the investigations to be carried out separately as the\nspecific effects may be diluted by a combination process.\nIn the first strategy, we used the IESSG\u2019s GPS Analysis Soft-\nware version 2.4 (GAS2.4; Stewart et al. 2002) to produce a series\nof daily double-difference (DD) regional network (RN) solutions\n(Teferle 2003; Teferle et al. 2006), below denoted as DDRN, for the\nperiod from 1997 March to 2005 December. In this case, the ref-\nerence frame definition was effected through the inclusion of four\nEuropean IGS stations, with well-determined station coordinates\nand velocities in the ITRF2000, as reference stations (Fig. 2).\nIn the second strategy, we used the IESSG\u2019s GNSS process-\ning tools to run the Bernese software version 5.0 (BSW5.0; Dach\net al. 2007) to produce a series of daily precise point position-\ning (PPP) globally transformed (GT) solutions (Teferle et al.\n2007), below denoted as PPPGT, for the period from 2000 Jan-\nuary to 2005 December. In this case, the reference frame defini-\ntion was effected by using the 99 IGS reference frame stations in-\ncluded in IGb00 [IGSMAIL-4748 (2003); IGSMAIL-4928 (2004)\non http:\/\/igscb.jpl.nasa.gov\/mail\/igsmail\/igsmail.html], the IGS re-\nalization of ITRF2000, as reference stations when computing the\ntransformation parameters (Fig. 2).\nAfter the CGPS processing, we formed coordinate time-series in\nITRF2000 from the daily position solutions from both processing\nC\u00a9 2009 The Authors, GJI, 178, 23\u201346\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2009 RAS\n30 F.

As such daily coordinate\nestimates have been shown to contain both temporal (e.g. Zhang\net al. 1997; Mao et al. 1999; Williams 2003; Williams et al. 2004)\nand spatial (e.g. Wdowinski et al. 1997; Nikolaidis 2002; Dong\net al. 2006) correlations we apply the following coordinate time-\nseries analysis strategy.\nTo account for white and coloured noise (temporally correlated\nerrors) in our coordinate time-series, we estimate, using the coor-\ndinate time-series analysis software CATS (Williams 2008) which\nemploys Maximum-Likelihood estimation (MLE), the parameters\nof a linear velocity, annual and semi-annual periodic terms, coor-\ndinate offset magnitudes, and the noise amplitudes for both white\nand coloured noise components. For the coloured noise component\nwe choose flicker noise rather than another power-law process, as it\nhas been shown to be widely present and a very appropriate model\nin CGPS coordinate time-series (Williams et al. 2004).\nWe use spatial filtering to reduce the spatially correlated features\nwithin the coordinate time-series, to improve the signal-to-noise ra-\ntio and station velocity uncertainties. Several spatial filtering meth-\nods involving simple unweighted and weighted stacking of daily\nresiduals (e.g. Wdowinski et al. 1997; Nikolaidis 2002; Wdowinski\net al. 2004) to more complex methods using Empirical Orthogonal\nFunctions (Dong et al. 2006; Teferle et al. 2008) have been sug-\ngested. Following Teferle et al. (2006), we use the weighted stacking\nmethod to compute the daily common mode bias as the weighted\nmean coordinate residual from a selection of stations on a particu-\nlar day and subtract this bias estimate from all unfiltered coordinate\ntime-series, forming our filtered coordinate time-series.\nIt has been suggested that the coordinate time-series used for the\ncomputation of the common mode bias should be of high quality and\nnot show any station-specific features (e.g. Wdowinski et al. 1997;\nNikolaidis 2002; Teferle 2003). This ensures that the computed bias\nC\u00a9 2009 The Authors, GJI, 178, 23\u201346\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2009 RAS\nCrustal motions in Great Britain 31\nonly contains the common systematic variations of the coordinate\ntime-series for a particular solution, as including a CGPS station\nbehaving in an unusual manner, that is, due to large multipath or\ninterference effects, would change the common mode estimate.\nWe argue that the effect of spatial filtering should merely be an\nimprovement in the signal-to-noise ratio of the coordinate time-\nseries and should not affect station velocity estimates such that\na departure, that is, a de-coupling, from a given reference frame\noccurs (Wdowinski et al. 1997, 2004).\nIn previous studies (e.g. Nikolaidis 2002; Wdowinski et al. 1997,\n2004), annual and semi-annual signals in the coordinate time-series\nwere assumed to be part of the spatially correlated noise and hence\nwere not modelled during the common mode bias computation, giv-\ning very smooth filtered coordinate time-series. Only Prawirodirdjo\net al. (2006) argued to model both these signals when computing the\ndaily common mode bias in order for the common mode to contain\nonly noise and not predictable thermo-elastic signal.\nIt is also well known that annual and semi-annual signals in\ncoordinate time-series can significantly bias station velocity esti-\nmates (Blewitt & Lavalle\u00b4e 2002). Assuming typical amplitudes of\n2\u20134 and 1\u20132 mm for annual and semi-annual signals, Blewitt &\nLavalle\u00b4e (2002) recommended that coordinate time-series with data\ntime spans of less than 2.5 yr should not be considered for inves-\ntigations and that for those with more than 2.5 yr the additional\nestimation of annual and semi-annual periodic terms would avoid\nthe associated velocity bias. Furthermore, they stated that this simul-\ntaneous estimation may not be necessary, once time-series reached\na span of more than 4.5 yr. With amplitudes of these signals often\nbeing significantly larger, it seems beneficial to continue to model\nthese signals. Therefore, we argue that not including terms for these\nsignals during the common mode bias computation may lead to\na non-zero, artificial linear trend in the daily common mode bias\ntime-series itself, which in turn will alter the trend of the filtered\ncoordinate time-series thereby biasing station velocity estimates.\nAlthough we agree that as the velocity bias due to periodic signals\nreduces with increasing length of the time-series, this issue will\nbecome less prominent for spatial filtering of longer ones.\nAnother factor that can influence station velocity estimates of fil-\ntered coordinate time-series that has, so far, not been mentioned in\nthe published literature and may thus be easily overlooked, is related\nto the way the station velocities are estimated in the common mode\nbias computation and thereafter in the analysis of the filtered coor-\ndinate time-series. Already Zhang et al. (1997) reported millimetre-\nlevel differences in their velocity estimates between those obtained\nfrom weighted least squares and more complex MLE. Similar dif-\nferences between the two methods for computing station velocities\nwere also reported in Teferle (2003) for some of the CGPS stations\nused in this study. As the station velocities are estimated several\ntimes during spatial filtering and the following analysis, it might\nseem convenient to mix both methods for computational efficiency\nand a faster analysis. Considering the above reported velocity differ-\nences, we argue that mixing of both methods potentially introduces\na velocity bias. In order to avoid this bias, we consistently use MLE\nthroughout the common mode bias estimation and the following\nanalysis of the filtered coordinate time-series.\n3.2 Absolute gravity\nThe processing and analysis of the AG measurements was carried\nout using the GAP (Gravity@POL) software developed at POL. The\ndata from each drop were fit using least squares to an equation of\nmotion that includes a known a-priori vertical gravity gradient.\nThe measurements of time were also corrected for the time delay\ndue to the finite speed of light. The gravity gradients for Newlyn\nand Aberdeen have been measured using a relative spring gravime-\nter (Hopewell 2003). For Lerwick, a standard value equal to the\nfree-air correction of \u22120.3086\u03bcGal mm\u22121 was used. Standard cor-\nrections were made for solid Earth tides, ocean tide loading, polar\nmotion, and comparator response (Niebauer et al. 1995; Williams\net al. 2001). Geophysical corrections were made for atmospheric\nloading using a single admittance factor and local pressure data. No\nattempt was made to correct for hydrological loading. Finally, the\nresults were transferred from the height of observation to a com-\nmon reference height. Data from each day were then combined into\na single mean value. To estimate the AG rates and their uncertain-\nties we used weighted least squares and assumed the gravity noise\nbudget consisted of an instrumental set up error (1.6\u03bcGal; Van\nCamp et al. 2005) that was common to all days during the measure-\nment campaign, a statistical error based on the daily drop-to-drop\nstandard deviations, and a long period noise that was modelled as\na first-order Gauss Markov process (Van Camp et al. 2005). In an\nadditional step, the error bars for each measurement campaign are\nscaled by the reduced chi-square fit to the mean value over those\ndays in an attempt to reflect the short-term day-to-day scatter.\nTo obtain an estimate of the vertical station velocity and associ-\nated uncertainty we need to apply a gravity\/uplift ratio. This ratio is\ndependent on many factors, not least the physical processes caus-\ning the deformation. Estimates from various models range from\n\u22120.15\u03bcGal mm\u22121 (Wahr et al. 1995) to \u22120.26\u03bcGal mm\u22121 (de\nLinage et al. 2007). Computed ratios from data range from \u22120.18 \u00b1\n0.03\u03bcGal mm\u22121 (Lambert et al. 2006) through \u22120.20 \u00b1 0.06\u03bcGal\nmm\u22121 to \u22120.24 \u00b1 0.13\u03bcGal mm\u22121 (Mazzotti et al. 2007). We used\na gravity\/uplift ratio of \u22120.2\u03bcGal mm\u22121 or \u22125 mm \u03bcGal\u22121 which\nis the mean of all these estimates. We do not, as yet, propagate\nuncertainties of the ratio, into the vertical station velocities. Nei-\nther are we prepared, given the scale of the deformation expected\nin Great Britain compared to Fennoscandia or North America, to\nattempt to estimate a ratio from the GPS and AG data sets.\n3.3 Geological information\nWe obtain an estimate of relative vertical crustal motion from the\ngeological information by fitting a linear trend to relative sea level\ndata from as early as 4000 cal. yr BP to the present day (Shennan\n1989; Shennan & Horton 2002). In some cases the oldest data are\nyounger than 4000 cal. yr BP and so the regression is over a shorter\nand more recent period. In applying this procedure, we assume that\nthere has been a negligible secular height shift of the sea surface\nover the period for which data exist at a given locality. Specifically,\nwe have assumed that there is no significant ocean surface height\nchange due to contemporaneous mass changes in continental ice\nsheets and glaciers or due to ocean water density changes.\nGIA can lead to ocean surface height changes in the UK through\ntwo processes. One is regional perturbations to the gravity field\ndue to vertical land motion. The corresponding geoid height shift\nis spatially correlated with the land motion signal, but is more\nthan an order of magnitude smaller (i.e. <0.1 mm yr\u22121 at most\nsites) and so is not accounted for here. A second process that leads\nto a global-scale lowering of the ocean surface following the last\nglacial maximum is known as ocean siphoning (Mitrovica & Peltier\n1991; Mitrovica & Milne 2002). This process is due to increasing\nocean basin volume associated with vertical motion of the ocean\nC\u00a9 2009 The Authors, GJI, 178, 23\u201346\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2009 RAS\n32 F. N.

Current GIA models predict this lowering to be about 0.2\u2013\n0.4 mm yr\u22121 during the late Holocene (e.g. Peltier 2001) and so\nestimates of vertical crustal motions inferred from relative sea level\ndata will be biased high (i.e. more positive) by this amount. Since\nthe magnitude of this effect is relatively small, we do not explicitly\nrevise the values of vertical crustal motion estimated from the rel-\native sea level data. However, in the data comparisons that follow,\nwe are mindful that the inferred estimates have a positive bias by a\nfew tenths of a millimetres per year.\n4 RESULTS\nThis section presents the horizontal and vertical station velocity esti-\nmates from CGPS. Using these estimates we carry out comparisons\nto quantify the effects of the two independent CGPS processing\nstrategies, spatial filtering, and reference frame implementations.\nFollowing this we present the vertical station velocity estimates\nfrom AG and the geological information before we start the in-\nterpretation of the station velocity estimates as crustal motions.\nBased on our horizontal station velocity estimates we investigate\nthe suitability of the current CGPS network to provide estimates of\nhorizontal crustal motion for geophysical interpretations, i.e. plate\nmotions or on a more demanding scale, the motions associated\nwith GIA processes. Using the vertical station velocity estimates\nwe carry out a comparison of these to those from AG, compute\nAG-aligned CGPS vertical station velocities, and compare these to\nvertical crustal motions from the geological evidence.\nFor convenience, we list the definitions of relevant acronyms\nwhich will be used extensively in the following sections in Table 5.\n4.1 Continuous GPS\nWe used the daily coordinate estimates for both CGPS processing\nstrategies to form coordinate time-series for 39 of the 44 CGPS sta-\ntions in Table 1.

From Fig. 3, it is clear that over 70 per\ncent of our coordinate time-series span a period of more than 5 yr.\nWe show the unfiltered and spatially filtered coordinate time-\nseries for each CGPS station for solutions DDRNU, DDRNF,\nPPPGTU and PPPGTF, respectively, in Figs S1\u2013S4 of the Sup-\nporting Information.\n4.1.1 Horizontal station velocities\nWe obtained horizontal station velocity estimates and associated\nuncertainties from the MLE for all four coordinate time-series so-\nlutions (Table 6 and Table S1 of the Supporting Information).\nIn the case of solutions DDRNU and DDRNF we excluded\nBLAK, COLC, HERT, LOND and OSHQ due to network size lim-\nitations in the GAS2.4 software while for the solutions PPPGTU\nand PPPGTF, BRST and RAL1 gave unreasonably noisy daily co-\nordinate estimates. HEMS was excluded due to its short data span,\nas it was decommissioned in 2001.\nWe draw several general conclusions from Table 6. First of all,\nthe four solutions show excellent overall agreement in their veloc-\nity estimates, well within their uncertainties (all uncertainties here\nand throughout this study are 1\u03c3 ). Second, there is a reduction in\nthe range of the velocity uncertainties for solutions DDRNF and\nPPPGTF compared to those of solutions DDRNU and PPPGTU,\nrespectively, which is a first indication of the effectiveness of the\nspatial filter.\nTo investigate the effect of the CGPS processing strategy on\nthe horizontal velocities we computed the mean of the velocity\ndifferences (and their corresponding standard deviations) between\nsolutions DDRNU and PPPGTU to be \u22120.0 \u00b1 0.4 and 0.1 \u00b1\n0.7 mm yr\u22121, for north and east, respectively.

We find excellent overall agreement between the ve-\nlocity estimates of the unfiltered and filtered coordinate time-series.\nTherefore, we conclude that we have largely avoided de-coupling\nour horizontal station velocity estimates from their given reference\nframes.\nAlthough we have shown excellent agreements between the four\ncoordinate time-series solutions, with standard deviations in the ve-\nlocity differences of less than 0.4 mm yr\u22121 for the north and less\nthan 0.7 mm yr\u22121 for the east component, there are several stations\nfor which the velocity differences are greater than 1.0 mm yr\u22121 in\nat least one comparison. We can list those stations to be CARD,\nIOMN, IOMS, MORP, NSTG, PMTG and SUNB. In almost all\ncases the large velocity differences are in the east component of the\ninvolved station. We associate the discrepancies for CARD with a\nshorter coordinate time-series of only 2.9 yr and a data gap in early\n2005; for IOMN and IOMS with their east velocity estimate in\nC\u00a9 2009 The Authors, GJI, 178, 23\u201346\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2009 RAS\n34 F.

Consid-\nering these findings we will concentrate on solutions DDRNF and\nPPPGTF in our discussions of the horizontal crustal motions in\nSection 4.4.\n4.1.2 Vertical station velocities\nIt is generally accepted that the vertical component of CGPS coor-\ndinate time-series is less well determined than the horizontal com-\nponents, hence we do not expect the excellent agreements found\nin the north and east velocity estimates between the four solutions\nto be repeated in our vertical station velocity estimates. Addition-\nally, the data time span will have a more significant effect on the\nestimates and as the coordinate time-series for solutions PPPGTU\nand PPPGTF are capped at 5 yr, this will affect the comparison\nbetween the two CGPS processing strategies. Furthermore, any\nother CGPS processing strategy-specific effects may be more pro-\nnounced in the vertical component and affect our station velocity\nestimates.\nWe obtained the vertical station velocity estimates and their asso-\nciated uncertainties from the MLE for all four coordinate time-series\nsolutions (Table 7 and Table S2 of the Supporting Information).\nThe velocities range from \u22122.8 to 3.3, \u22122.0 to 1.5, \u22122.6 to 2.3\nand \u22121.7 to 1.6 mm yr\u22121 for solutions DDRNU, PPPGTU, DDRNF\nand PPPGTF, respectively. This suggests not only that the spread\nis somewhat processing strategy dependent, but also that spatial\nfiltering reduces the spread for both strategies. Similarly, we show\nthe vertical station velocity uncertainties for solutions DDRNU,\nPPPGTU, DDRNF and PPPGTF to range from \u00b10.5 to \u00b12.4, \u00b10.7\nto \u00b15.5, \u00b10.4 to \u00b11.9 and \u00b10.2 to \u00b15.1 mm yr\u22121, respectively.\nAlthough these ranges appear to be quite large, it is shown that the\nupper bounds in all ranges are related to station CARD. We com-\npute the mean of the velocity uncertainties (and their correspond-\ning standard deviations) for solutions DDRNU, PPPGTU, DDRNF\nand PPPGTF to be 0.9 \u00b1 0.4, 1.1 \u00b1 0.8, 0.6 \u00b1 0.3 and 0.7 \u00b1\n0.8 mm yr\u22121, respectively. We point out that, first, solutions DDRNU\nand DDRNF seem to be more homogeneous than solutions PPPGTU\nand PPPGTF, as both the mean velocity uncertainties and their\nstandard deviations are smaller, and, secondly, that spatial filter-\ning clearly improved the homogeneity of solutions DDRNF and\nPPPGTF by reducing the mean velocity uncertainties.\nConsidering the mean of the vertical station velocity differences\n(and their corresponding standard deviations) between solutions\nDDRNU and DDRNF, and solutions PPPGTU and PPPGTF, we\ncompute these to be 0.2 \u00b1 0.6 and \u22120.1 \u00b1 0.5 mm yr\u22121, respec-\ntively, confirming that the effect of spatial filtering on the verti-\ncal station velocity estimates is negligible, and that we have again\navoided a de-coupling from the given reference frame. However,\nwhen considering the mean of the velocity differences (and their\ncorresponding standard deviations) between solutions DDRNU and\nPPPGTU and solutions DDRNF and PPPGTF, we compute these to\nbe 1.1 \u00b1 1.1 and 0.7 \u00b1 0.6 mm yr\u22121, respectively, which suggests\na systematic bias in the vertical station velocity estimates between\nthe regional and global solutions for both the unfiltered and fil-\ntered cases.

Absolute gravity time-series for Lerwick (a), and Newlyn (b) AG\nstations used in this study. The red dots show the AG estimates of absolute\ngravity and the blue line represents the best-fitting linear trend in the absolute\ngravity estimates.\nBased on the results presented in this section, we conclude that\nparallel processing with two or more independent CGPS processing\nstrategies is essential in order to make the best use of stations that\nhave data of varying quality. We note that when considered together\nwith the vertical crustal motion estimates from the geological infor-\nmation (below), it is suggested that the more realistic solutions for\nABER, DUNK and NPLD might be DDRNU and DDRNF whereas\nthe more realistic solutions for MALG, NSTG and LIVE might be\nPPPGTU and PPPGTF.\n4.2 Absolute gravity\nThe AG time-series for Newlyn and Aberdeen are shown in Fig. 4.\nA visual inspection shows that there appears to be a positive change\nin AG at both Lerwick and Newlyn AG stations, which would\nequate to subsidence at those sites. We do not show the time-series\nfor the AG station in Aberdeen in Fig. 4 as we see a very bimodal\ndistribution in the results. This could be a result of local hydrological\nconditions at the site. The church in which the AG measurements\nare made, is at the edge of the granitic bedrock in Aberdeen on a\nsliver of conglomerate and situated next to alluvial sediments in the\nvalley of the river Don. We assume that due to local hydrological\nconditions, our current AG results for this station are not reliable\nand would need to be treated with extreme caution. In the future, we\nmay need to locate a new AG site in Aberdeen or perhaps measure\nin winter when the soil may become completely saturated giving\na more constant gravity effect (Lambert et al. 2006). Therefore,\nwe did not include the estimated changes in AG or vertical station\nvelocity for the AG station in Aberdeen in our further analysis.\nAs stated in above, we have not attempted to correct for any hy-\ndrological variations. At Newlyn and Lerwick we are confident that\nthe hydrological conditions produce only minimal annual variations\nthat are further limited by the fact that we measure annually at nearly\nthe same time each year. The church at Newlyn is built on solid gran-\nite bedrock with minimal soil cover and the basement of the school\nin Lerwick is surrounded by a concrete cap, which should minimize\nrainfall infiltration into the soil in the nearby vicinity. However, we\ndo intend to study the hydrological conditions at all three sites in the\nfuture. For Lerwick and Newlyn, we estimate changes in AG and\ntheir uncertainties of +0.10 \u00b1 0.19 and +0.14 \u00b1 0.14\u03bcGal yr\u22121,\nand of vertical station velocities and their uncertainties of \u22120.5 \u00b1\n1.0 and \u22120.7 \u00b1 0.7 mm yr\u22121, respectively. The increased noise in\nthe last few Newlyn campaigns reflects an increase in day-to-day\nscatter of those data sets. This can be partly explained by a notice-\nable increase in the scatter of the superspring in FG5-103 over the\nlast few years. However, since no comparable increase is evident in\nthe results at Lerwick another, so far unexplained, factor must also\nbe involved that is perhaps local to Newlyn.\nAt this stage, we point to Appendix B which discusses the level-\nling ties between the AG station and the TG benchmarks at New-\nlyn, and serves to validate the AG-alignment procedure carried out\nlater.\n4.3 Geological information\nShennan & Horton (2002) and Shennan et al. (2006) obtained esti-\nmates of vertical crustal motions based on Holocene sea level data\nfor over 50 locations in Great Britain to form a map. For complete-\nness we list a subset of these sites, which are of interest for this\nstudy owing to their proximity to the CGPS and AG stations, in\nTable 4 together with their estimates of vertical crustal motion.\n4.4 Horizontal crustal motions\nWe obtain estimates of horizontal crustal motions for Great Britain\nfrom our horizontal CGPS station velocity estimates if we assume\nthat the apparent station displacement is solely due to motion of the\nEarth\u2019s crust and does not include any movement associated with\nthe location or monumentation of the CGPS station. In this case\nFigs 5(a) and (b) show the absolute horizontal station velocity esti-\nmates for solutions DDRNF and PPPGTF, respectively. Also shown\nare velocities computed for the CGPS stations in Great Britain\nbased on the ITRF2000 plate motion model (Altamimi et al. 2002,\nTable S3 of the Supporting Information).\nFrom Figs 5(a) and (b), we can see that there is generally good\nagreement in both direction and magnitude of the velocity vectors\nbetween both solutions and the model. However, a better impression\nof the agreement at a particular CGPS station is gained by look-\ning at the residual velocities, i.e. after subtracting the ITRF2000\nplate motion model velocities (Altamimi et al. 2002). The resid-\nual velocities will show to what extent the CGPS stations move\naccording to the plate motion model, but also, more importantly\nat this stage, will show which stations do not behave in an ex-\npected manner. As mentioned previously, we expect a horizontal\nGIA signal at the 1-2 mm yr\u22121 level (Bradley et al. 2009) to be su-\nperimposed onto the observed plate motion. In addition, since only a\nfew CGPS stations in Great Britain are believed to have appropriate\ngeodetic-quality monumentation, we cannot ignore the possibility\nof additional movements due to local factors.\nSince we do not estimate integer ambiguities in either solution,\nwe would expect the east component velocities to be somewhat\nbiased (e.g. Johansson et al. 2002). Therefore, we do not investigate\nthe plate motion signal in Great Britain any further at this stage,\nbut instead try to identify those stations that seem to behave in a\nconsistent manner, ensuring their use in our investigations into the\nhorizontal component of the GIA signal.\nFigs 5(c) and (d) show the residual velocity vectors for solutions\nDDRNF and PPPGTF given in Table 8. Comparing the horizontal\nvelocity vectors from both solutions, there are a number of stations,\nwhich show excellent agreement with the ITRF2000 plate motion\nC\u00a9 2009 The Authors, GJI, 178, 23\u201346\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2009 RAS\n36 F.

There are obviously also stations with fewer similarities to\nthe plate motion model in their residuals and some showing much\nlarger residuals. Stations with residuals visibly larger than 1 mm\nyr\u22121 in both solutions are ABYW, LIVE, MORP and PMTG, while\nNSTG shows a large residual only for solution DDRNF. However,\nit is important to note that we have already identified these CGPS\nstations as likely to give unreliable results based on their data quality.\nFrom Figs 5(c) and (d) as well as Table 8 it is noticeable that for a\nnumber of stations there are large differences in their error ellipses\nand uncertainties, respectively. Primarily, these depend on the length\nof the coordinate time-series and magnitude of their day-to-day\nscatter, which is a reflection of the amount of noise and the ratio of its\nwhite and coloured noise components. Ultimately, the uncertainties\nwill also depend on how well a particular coordinate time-series\ncan be modelled, as velocity, offsets, periodic signals, and noise,\nand on how much spatial filtering improves the time-series and\nsubsequently the final model fit. A more detailed investigation of\nthe stochastic properties of the coordinate time-series on station-\nspecific and solution-specific effects would go beyond the scope of\nthis study.\nFrom a geophysical perspective, the estimates of absolute and\nresidual horizontal crustal motion confirm that overall Great Britain\nbehaves in a consistent manner with Eurasia plate motion and that\nthere is, with the current resolution, no discernible internal de-\nformation in the horizontal velocity field over the area investigated.\nContrary to previous studies (Nocquet et al. 2001; Nocquet & Calais\n2003), our results do not confirm any residual motion of southeast\nEngland with respect to Eurasia.\nFurther investigation reveals a distribution depending on two cat-\negories of monumentation used. We can separate stations believed to\nbe sufficiently connected to bedrock (either via a carbon-fibre pole\nwith stainless steel ends attached to a submerged concrete block\nthat rests directly on top of bedrock, or via a large structure, i.e.\nBarking Barrier) from those mounted on roofs or walls of single to\nC\u00a9 2009 The Authors, GJI, 178, 23\u201346\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2009 RAS\nCrustal motions in Great Britain 37\nTable 8.

As some of the\ntime-series are still just above the minimum recommended length of\n2.5 yr we show the residual horizontal station velocities against the\ntime span used for both categories of monumentation (Figs 6c and\nd). Unfortunately, our results presented in Fig. 6 are inconclusive.\nThere may be a suggestion that stations on brick buildings give sim-\nilar results to those of bedrock stations, independent of solutions,\nas there is no clear separation. Also, the time span does not seem to\nhave a large effect on the residual velocity magnitude. This is not\nnecessarily what we would have expected, but it confirms some of\nthe findings of Calais et al. (2006) and, in a way also, of Beavan\n(2005).\nOverall, ignoring the five stations with very large residuals, the\nmagnitude of the residuals is larger for those of solution DDRNF\nthan for PPPGTF. We can confirm this by comparing Figs 6(a) and\n(b), and by computing the root-mean-square (rms) statistic of the\nresiduals, which is 1.0 and 0.7 mm yr\u22121 for solutions DDRNF and\nPPPGTF, respectively.\nFrom Table 8 we can also compute that for solution DDRNF the\nRMS of the north component residuals is less than for the east com-\nponent residuals, confirming either the aforementioned possible bias\nin our east component due to not fixing ambiguities to integers or\na symptom of the reference frame implementation for this solution.\nHowever, as the east component residuals of solution PPPGTF are\njust slightly larger than the north component residuals, this might\nbe an indication that the source of the bias in solution DDRNF is\nlargely due to the particular reference frame implementation and\nonly to a small degree due to the float ambiguities.\nNevertheless, we have shown that overall our horizontal station\nvelocity estimates do not appear to be affected by monumentation\nC\u00a9 2009 The Authors, GJI, 178, 23\u201346\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2009 RAS\n38 F.

In order to achieve\nthis, we compare the CGPS and AG estimates of vertical station\nvelocities with each other, compute AG-aligned CGPS estimates\n(Teferle et al. 2006) and compare the AG-aligned CGPS estimates\nwith the independent evidence of vertical crustal motions from the\nHolocene sea level data for Great Britain.\nSeveral authors have published alternative and independent ev-\nidence for vertical crustal motions in Great Britain which include\nestimates based on geological information, sea level observations\nand predictions from GIA models. As reported by Teferle et al.\n(2006), it is possible to carry out comparisons of the geodetic es-\ntimates of vertical crustal motions from AG and CGPS to those\nalternative data sets.\nTeferle et al.

N. Teferle et al.\nand finally, most recently, another study (Mazzotti et al. 2007) found\ntheir CGPS estimates of vertical station velocity to be more posi-\ntive than those from AG by on average 2.2 \u00b1 1.3 mm yr\u22121 for the\nnorthern Cascadia in the United States and Canada.\nPresently, the general consensus in the international community\nis that current CGPS estimates of vertical station velocity may\nbe systematically biased, which is due to a combination of: the\nuse of models for relative antenna phase centre variations, that is,\ninadequate modelling of satellite and receiver antenna phase centres\nin a changing satellite constellation (e.g. Ge et al. 2005; Cardellach\net al. 2007); the use of current terrestrial reference frames, such as\nITRF2000 and ITRF2005 (e.g. Blewitt et al. 2006); and, in the case\nof solutions DDRNU and DDRNF, limitations in using a regional\nrather than a global network and reference frame implementation,\nfor which we have already shown a systematic offset of +1.1 or\n+0.7 mm yr\u22121 when compared to solutions PPPGTU and PPPGTF,\nrespectively.\nWith this in mind, we now assume that the presented vertical\nstation velocity estimates for solutions PPPGTU and PPPGTF are\ntruly with respect to ITRF2000. We have shown that in both cases\nthese are systematically offset, that is, more positive, when com-\npared to those from AG. The update to ITRF2005, the most recent\nterrestrial frame realization, however, brought about an increase of\nthis systematic bias in our CGPS velocity estimates for both so-\nlutions. Altamimi et al. (2007) pointed out that due to a rate in\nthe Z-translation of the ITRF2005 with respect to ITRF2000, the\nvertical component of ITRF2005 will differ by +1.8 \u00d7 sin (\u03c6) mm\nyr\u22121 to that of ITRF2000, with \u03c6 being the station latitude. At the\nsame time, the ITRF2000 scale rate was shown to be 0.08 ppb yr\u22121\nwith respect to ITRF2005, which would reduce the contribution of\nthe Z-translation rate to the vertical station velocity differences by\n0.5 mm yr\u22121. This means that for Great Britain, which lies between\nthe latitudes of 50\u25e6N and 60\u25e6N, the ITRF2005 vertical station veloc-\nities will be about 0.9\u20131.1 mm yr\u22121, respectively, larger than those\nof ITRF2000. However, with the current concerns about the correct-\nness of the Z-translation rate (Altamimi et al. 2007; Argus 2007)\nand the other aforementioned issues related to antenna phase centre\nand atmospheric modelling, we decided to present our results based\non ITRF2000. Interestingly, if we assume that the ITRF2000 scale\nrate, as determined with respect to ITRF2005, is correct, then the\nassociated change in the vertical station velocities of 0.5 mm yr\u22121\nwould agree favourably with our systematic bias of 0.6 mm yr\u22121\nbetween the CGPS and AG estimates of vertical station velocity for\nsolutions PPPGTU and PPPGTF.\nTeferle et al. (2006) presented a very simple procedure for com-\nbining CGPS and AG estimates of vertical station velocity, based\non aligning the CGPS estimates to the AG estimates using the sys-\ntematic offset between them. Following this procedure, we compute\nAG-aligned CGPS estimates of vertical station velocity, the sys-\ntematic offset relating to a particular CGPS solution being basically\nsubtracted from the CGPS estimate of vertical station velocity for\na station. Through this procedure, the CGPS estimates of vertical\nstation velocity presented in Table 7 are changed to the AG-aligned\nCGPS estimates given in Table 10, which only shows the reliable\nestimates (based on the discussions above).\nIt is clear from Table 10 that the AG-aligned CGPS estimates of\nvertical station velocity from solutions DDRNU, DDRNF, PPPGTU\nand PPPGTF are in much better agreement than the correspond-\ning CGPS estimates of vertical station velocity. We show that\nthe mean offset (and its corresponding standard deviation) be-\ntween the estimates of vertical station velocity from the two CGPS\nsoftware\/processing strategies are reduced from +1.1 \u00b1 1.1 to\n+0.1 \u00b1 1.1 mm yr\u22121 between solutions DDRNU and PPPGTU,\nand from +0.7 \u00b1 0.6 to +0.0 \u00b1 0.6 mm yr\u22121 between solutions\nDDRNF and PPPGTF, when aligning the CGPS to the AG re-\nsults. Appendix C includes further evidence for the validation\nof the AG-alignment procedure carried out, through comparison\nof the CGPS and AG-aligned CGPS estimates of vertical sta-\ntion velocity for ABER, BRST and NEWL with results from\nWo\u00a8ppelmann et al. (2007), a recent analysis as part of the IGS TIGA\nPilot-Project.\nThe effect of the AG-alignment procedure on the vertical crustal\nmotions for Great Britain can be clearly seen in Fig. 7. This figure\nshows maps of vertical crustal motions from CGPS estimates and\nAG-aligned CGPS estimates of vertical station velocity for solutions\nDDRNF and PPPGTF.\nFor comparison we also show a map of vertical crustal motions\nfor Great Britain derived from the geological information. Although\nFig. 8 is based on the complete geological data set (Shennan &\nHorton 2002; Shennan et al. 2006) it only shows the sites mentioned\nin this study.\nClearly visible in these vertical crustal motion maps are the sim-\nilarities in the primary areas of uplift in Scotland and subsidence\nin England and Wales. However, the outline of areas undergoing\nuplift or subsidence in Figs 7(c) and (d) are quite dissimilar in that\nthe map based on solution DDRNF suggests that the whole west\ncoast of Great Britain is rising with respect to the easterly regions of\n350\u02da 352\u02da 354\u02da 356\u02da 358\u02da 0\u02da 2\u02da 4\u02da\n50\u02da\n52\u02da\n54\u02da\n56\u02da\n58\u02da\n60\u02da 250 km\nGeology\n-3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3\n[mm\/yr]\nFigure 8.

As this tilt is not apparent in Figs 7(b) and (d), we assume\nit is due to the regional reference frame implementation which uses\nIGS stations on the European mainland, all lying in the area to the\nsouth and east of Great Britain, and note that this is clearly not being\nremoved through the current AG-alignment procedure.\nFor solution PPPGTF, Figs 7(b) and (d), the situation is quite\ndifferent. First, there does not seem to be a network tilt and secondly,\nit is more difficult to argue in favour of the alignment.\nThis can be further investigated by directly comparing the AG-\naligned CGPS estimates of vertical crustal motions to those from\nthe geological information presented in Table 4. The table gives\nvertical crustal motions for a number of geological sites, which can\nbe assigned a close-by CGPS station for comparison. We show a\ncomparison of these motions for locations along the western and\neastern coasts of Great Britain for solutions DDRNF and PPPGTF in\nFig. 9.

Nevertheless, it can be seen that for both CGPS\nsolutions, the AG-aligned CGPS estimates are generally more nega-\ntive than the geology; with the principal exception of the CGPS@TG\nstation NEWL, which has AG-aligned CGPS estimates of vertical\ncrustal motion which are consistently less negative than those from\nthe geological information and more consistent with those suggested\nby Gehrels (2006) and Massey et al.

This suggests that\nthe AG-alignment procedure does improve the agreement with ge-\nological information for solution DDNRF even when the network\nof stations is expanded from those in Teferle et al.

This outcome seems at first not to be repeated for\nthe case of solution PPPGTF, where we see an increase in the mean\noffset and RMS statistic between the geological and the AG-aligned\nCGPS estimates of vertical crustal motion, when compared to using\nthe CGPS estimates. However, if we take into account the effect of\nocean siphoning, as mentioned previously, this would lower all of\nthe geological vertical crustal motion estimates by between 0.2 and\n0.4 mm yr\u22121 and hence lead to a further reduction of the mean off-\nsets and rms between the AG-aligned CGPS and geological vertical\ncrustal motion estimates.\nWe note that this comparison does not account for any differ-\nential vertical motions between the sites of the CGPS stations and\ngeological information. If we consider the station separation from\nTable 4 it is clear that this assumption may not hold true in all cases,\nand this potentially explains some of the differences seen at GLAS,\nINVE and IOMS on the western coast and at KING and NEWC\non the eastern coast, which suggests that the vertical station ve-\nlocity estimates at these stations may not represent vertical crustal\nmotions. Interestingly, we can, however, confirm that the vertical\nstation velocity estimates for the CGPS@TG stations do appear to\nrepresent vertical crustal motions and that there is no local scale\nsubsidence evident (see Fig. 10).\nFig. 10 also shows that there is no visible correlation between the\ndifference in vertical crustal motion from the AG-aligned CGPS\nestimates of solution PPPGTF and the geological evidence, with\ndistance between the CGPS station and the geological site, at least\nup to 50 km.\n5 CONCLUS IONS\nOver the last decade the geodetic evidence from CGPS and AG data\ncollected in Great Britain has reached a level of maturity that allows\nthe interpretation of this evidence as present-day crustal motions.\nTogether with estimates of motion using Holocene sea level data\nfrom sites close to those of CGPS and AG measurements, we have\nintroduced a comprehensive data set useful for studies of crustal\nmotion information for Great Britain.\nWe derived horizontal crustal motions for Great Britain from our\nCGPS estimates of horizontal station velocity under the assump-\ntion that the CGPS stations only experience displacements due to\nhorizontal crustal motions. The apparent crustal motion signal fol-\nlows the predicted motions of the ITRF2000 plate motion model\nwith residual velocities being generally smaller than 1 mm yr\u22121. The\nresidual velocities are apparently random, there is no discernible in-\nternal deformation, and they show no dependence on station mon-\numentation or time-series length. Our results do not confirm the\npreviously reported residual motion signal in southeast England.\nWe derived vertical crustal motions for Great Britain from our\nCGPS and AG-aligned CGPS estimates of vertical station veloc-\nity under the assumption that the CGPS and AG stations only\n-2\n-1\n0\n1\n2\nVe\nlo\nci\nty\n D\niff\ner\nen\nce\n [m\nm\/\nyr]\n0 10 20 30 40 50\nInter-station Distance [km]\nABYW\nBARK\nCAMB\nCARL\nDARE\nEDIN\nGLAS\nHERS\nINVE\nIOMN\nIOMSKING\nLOWE\nMALG\nNEWC\nNEWL\nNSTG\nPMTG\nSHEE\nTHUR\nPPPGTF\nFigure 10. Differences between geodetic and geological vertical crustal mo-\ntion estimates versus their interstation distances. Differences were computed\nbetween the AG-aligned CGPS estimates of vertical crustal motion, from\nthe filtered BSW5.0 globally transformed PPP (PPPGTF) coordinate time-\nseries solution, and those from geological information (Shennan & Horton\n2002). Grey circles indicate CGPS@TG stations, and black circles other\nscientific and network RTK CGPS stations. The grey-shaded area indicates\nthe region of 0.2\u20130.4 mm yr\u22121 agreement between the motion estimates if\nthe geological evidence were corrected for ocean siphoning. Uncertainties\nare 1\u03c3 .\nexperience displacements due to vertical crustal motions. Over-\nall our results confirmed the expected pattern of subsidence on\nShetland, uplift in most areas of Scotland, and subsidence in large\nareas of England and Wales, and suggest that, in general, the pat-\ntern of present-day vertical crustal motions based on geodetic data\nis consistent with the pattern of vertical crustal motions based on\nHolocene sea level data, that is, no substantial difference is apparent\nbetween the present-day and Holocene vertical motions.\nUsing the vertical crustal motions from the geological informa-\ntion based on Holocene sea level data we investigated the effective-\nness of the AG-alignment procedure to eliminate biases inherent in\ncurrent CGPS results and the associated estimates of vertical sta-\ntion velocity. With the overall uncertainty associated with current\nterrestrial reference frames, the AG-alignment clearly provided im-\nproved estimates of vertical station velocity for both the regional\nand global reference frame implementations.\nAlthough we expect further improvements in our CGPS results\nthrough a reprocessing of the CGPS data for Great Britain using\nan updated processing strategy, this will only be possible once the\nrequired products have been made available by the IGS. At this\nstage an inclusion of the new AG station at Herstmonceux will\nalso benefit the computation of the alignment and together with an\nexpansion of the AG station network, a more sophisticated AG-\nCGPS combination process could be derived.\nFor now we have provided a comprehensive data set of present-\nday crustal motions in Great Britain which has already supported\nthe work described in Woodworth et al. (2009) and Bradley et al.\n(2009), and highlighted the importance of the complementary nature\nof the geodetic techniques of CGPS and AG, and of the requirement\nfor independent data sets, that is, the geological information.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe work presented was partly funded through the UK Department\nfor Environment Food and Rural Affairs, the Environment Agency\nC\u00a9 2009 The Authors, GJI, 178, 23\u201346\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2009 RAS\nCrustal motions in Great Britain 43\nand the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC).

After close inspection of solutions DDRNU and\nPPPGTU we selected 20 and 24 stations, respectively, and their\ncoordinate components for the computation of the daily common\nmode bias (Table 11). Our stations-of-choice were those with long\ntime spans, few coordinate offsets and those not exhibiting any\nstation-specific characteristics, such as unusual or larger periodic\nsignals or features (e.g. the north component of SHEE, Fig. S1).\nAs can be seen, as a result of this selection process, none of the\nIGS stations located in Great Britain (HERS, HERT, MORP and\nNPLD) were included to compute the bias. Also, we note that judg-\ning from the coordinate time-series for BLAK, COLC and OSHQ,\nand THUR (Fig. S3), it is unlikely that their additional use in the\nbias computation for solution PPPGTU had a noticeable effect on\nthe bias compared to solution DDRNU and the filtered coordinate\ntime-series thereafter, as the bias estimate was based on 20 or more\nstations from early 2000 onwards (Fig. 11). Also, on days with less\nTable 11.

The stability,\nin a local and regional context, of NEWL could have an impact\non the nature of the apparent systematic offset between the CGPS\nestimate of vertical station velocity and the AG estimate, which is\nfor the AG station located in the church at Paul about 1.5 km away.\nThe mean sea level records from the Newlyn tide gauge for\nthe period 1915-21 were used to define Ordnance Datum Newlyn\n(ODN) and the Tidal Observatory has remained in the same loca-\ntion since that time. The primary tide gauge benchmark (PTGBM)\nat Newlyn is a bolt, adjacent to the stilling well, inside the Tidal\nObservatory. The PTGBM was first connected to the primary level-\nling network in 1915 and was last verified by precise levelling (line\nG001) in 1990. The TGBM network is effectively formed from\nseven benchmarks, comprising the PTGBM, two benchmarks on\nthe pier, two benchmarks in the village and two fundamental bench-\nmarks (FBMs), located at Tolcarne, about 900 m northwest of the\nPTGBM and at Paul, about 1.4 km southwest of the PTGBM. The\nFBMs are founded on solid rock, whereas all of the other inland\nbenchmarks are Ordnance Survey flush brackets set into walls. The\nTGBM network was first connected to the PTGBM in 1952 and last\nverified by precise levelling (line G001) in 1990. The results of the\nrepeated precise levelling surveys showed no significant changes\n(i.e. less than 0.1 mm) in height within the TGBM network over the\nperiod from 1952 to 1990, which suggests that the pier on which\nthe tide gauge and the CGPS@TG station are located did not expe-\nrience any uplift or subsidence relative to any of the benchmarks,\nincluding the two FBMs founded on solid rock, and is stable in a\nlocal context.\nA further confirmation of this can be obtained for a regional\ncontext by considering the vertical station velocities estimated for\nNEWL along with the vertical station velocities estimated for the\nscientific CGPS station CAMB, which is at Camborne about 20 km\naway and founded on solid rock (Table 2). In this respect, it can\nbe reported that the CGPS estimates of vertical station velocity for\nCAMB were +0.8 \u00b1 0.8 and +0.5 \u00b1 0.4 mm yr\u22121 for solutions\nDDRNU and DDRNF, respectively, which agree with the estimates\nfor NEWL (Table 7) of +1.1 \u00b1 1.1 and +0.6 \u00b1 0.9 mm yr\u22121 to\nwithin 0.3 and 0.1 mm yr\u22121.\nConsidering these two different sets of results, therefore, we con-\nclude that the apparent systematic offsets of +1.8, +0.9, +1.4 and\n+0.9 mm yr\u22121 (Table 9) between the CGPS and AG estimates of\nvertical station velocity for Newlyn are not due to relative move-\nments between the CGPS@TG station NEWL founded on the pier\nadjacent to Newlyn tide gauge and the AG station founded on solid\nrock in the church at Paul, some 1.5 km away.\nUnfortunately, a similar assessment cannot be carried out for the\nAG and CGPS stations at Lerwick on Shetland as similar data to\nthat presented for Newlyn is not available, but at least considering\nNewlyn, this serves to validate the AG-alignment process carried\nout.\nAPPENDIX C : COMPARISONS AT\nCGPS@TG STATIONS ABER , BRST\nAND NEWL\nFor ABER, BRST and NEWL it is possible to compare our vertical\nstation velocity estimates to results from Wo\u00a8ppelmann et al. (2007),\na recent analysis as part of the IGS TIGA Pilot-Project which used\nover 200 globally distributed CGPS stations. Their vertical station\nvelocity estimates were computed using the GAMIT (King & Bock\n2005) and CATREF (Altamimi et al. 2004) software, applying the\nnew absolute satellite and receiver antenna phase centre corrections\n(Ge et al. 2005), new tropospheric delay modelling (Bo\u00a8hm et al.\n2006) and atmospheric pressure loading corrections (Tregoning &\nVan Dam 2005). Their reference frame implementation was based\non IGb00, so includes an equivalent set of stations as for our im-\nplementation in the solutions based on PPPGT. Using a time span\nof 6.7 years, Wo\u00a8ppelmann et al. (2007) computed vertical station\nvelocity estimates for ABER, BRST and NEWL to be 0.2 \u00b1 0.1,\n\u22121.2 \u00b1 0.1 and \u22121.0 \u00b1 0.2 mm yr\u22121, respectively. When compar-\ning these to our CGPS and AG-aligned CGPS estimates (Tables 7\nand 10), we show a reduction in the velocity differences for ABER,\nBRST and NEWL from +1.1, +2.5, and +1.7 mm yr\u22121 to \u22120.2,\n+1.2 and +0.4 mm yr\u22121, respectively for solution DDRNF, and for\nNEWL from 1.2 to 0.6 mm yr\u22121 for solution PPPGTF. Again, this\nserves to validate the AG-alignment process carried out.\nSUPPORTING INFORMATION\nAdditional Supporting Information may be found in the online ver-\nsion of this article:\nAppendix S1.
