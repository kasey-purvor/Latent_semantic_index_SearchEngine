It would be foolish to \nclaim that each of us is capable of anything and everything to which we set our minds.  \nBut going to university is really about progressing beyond our perceived limits.  \n \n     The 'fuel' for this progress can come from yourself \u2013 self-confidence, self-belief or \njust a willingness to give it your best shot.  The enemy is the fatalistic notion that \none's abilities are fixed; that one is naturally bright or not; and little can be done to \nchange this (Dweck, 1999).  Good teaching instils in students a sense that \nachievement is not predetermined but flexible (Yorke and Knight, 2004).  It is \nimportant for all students to believe that they can make a difference \n \n     Another source of 'motive power' is your fellow students.  Your class or tutorial \ngroup comprises people who are rarely in direct competition with you.  Working \ncollectively (where this is allowed) gives everyone access to the skills and ideas (good \nand bad) of the whole group.   Indeed, the ability to work effectively with a set of \nother students is a skill many geography departments try to develop in their students \nand which many employers value.  According to the Geography Benchmarking \nStatement, which applies to all geography departments, students should acquire the \nkey skill of dealing with \"interpersonal situations, including working with \ngroups\/teams and recognising and respecting the viewpoints of others\" (Quality \nAssurance Agency, 2000).  \n \n     Finally, universities are no longer (if ever they were) institutions which require \neveryone to study in identical ways.  A major stimulus to recognising that different \nstudents have different needs, which universities have an obligation to meet, was the \npassing of the Disability Discrimination Act in 1995 and the Special Educational \nNeeds and Disability Act (SENDA) in 2001, which came into force in stages between \n2002 and 2005.  Perhaps you do not think of yourself as 'disabled'?  Yet the Act \ndefines as disabled anyone who has \"a physical or mental impairment which has a \nsubstantial and long-term adverse effect on his or her ability to carry out normal day-\nto-day activities\".  This can include not only the user of a wheel chair and people with \neven minor impairments of sight or hearing, but the student who stammers or has \ndyslexia, autism, epilepsy, arthritis, vertigo or M.E.  The guidance is that the \ndefinition of disability should be very wide.  So, if you are not disabled, then the \nchances are that someone in your group of fellow students will be.  The breadth of \nteaching methods used in geography \u2013 laboratory work, use of computers, oral \npresentations, fieldwork, site visits, dissertations \u2013 means that many students may \nhave difficulties with some aspect of the geography curriculum (Hall and Healey, \n2004).   \n2 \n \n     Universities are now required to make reasonable adjustments to how they teach \nstudents in order to avoid the charge of discrimination.  Currently the word \n'reasonable' is poorly defined and will remain so until the courts have established case \nlaw.  However, the advice to universities is to interpret 'reasonably' in a broad manner, \nunless adjustments are impossible, the costs excessive, other students would be \ndisadvantaged, or safety issues are predominant.  Even in these cases, the presumption \nis that the university will find a separate and accessible way of achieving the same \nlearning objectives for those students with disabilities.  \n \n     So, students who come within the wide definition of those 'with disabilities or \nimpairments' can ask for reasonable adjustments to be made to help them study.  \nUniversities are required to anticipate the range of disabilities that you might have, \nand they should have plans that can be put into operation when individual students \narrive.  Through the university you can also access the Disabled Students' Allowance, \nwhich provides funds to help buy support services or equipment that will help you \nstudy more effectively at university (Department for Education and Skills). \n \nDisclosure \nOf course, universities are not mind-readers.  Unless you tell them about your needs, \nthey cannot judge whether you might have particular difficulties that other students do \nnot have with life at university or a geography degree course, and hence whether they \nshould consider making reasonable adjustments to help you.  Equally your fellow \nstudents cannot know whether or how to help unless they too know \u2013 which may \nplace you in a dilemma.  Although help may level the uneven playing field, how \nmuch do you want people to know about you?  Only you can decide this. \n     It may be that your disability is obvious \u2013 blindness, for example.  The issue here \nis that people \u2013 keen to help \u2013 will assume that they know what you really need.  This, \nthe rushing forward group, needs training in what to do, if anything.  If your disability \nis not obvious and perhaps affects you only intermittently (e.g. epilepsy or depression) \nor in certain circumstances (agoraphobia, for example), then you have to decide what \nand how much to tell the university about yourself.  If you do not \u2013 and you are not \nobliged to \u2013 the university cannot make any different provision for you.  If your \ncondition is normally under control \u2013 a chronic pain problem, for example \u2013 then you \nmay be able to cope except under occasional circumstances (perhaps a field course \nthat involves climbing a mountain in cold weather).  The rule under the Act is that \nonce you have told anyone in the university about yourself, everyone in the university \nwho needs to know will be told.  You do not have to tell each lecturer separately.  \nEqually, the information about you is strictly confidential and will not be disclosed to \nanyone unless they need to know in order to help you.  \n \nPlanning \nThe best rule is 'plan early'.  Plan accommodation and transport.  Check what the \ncourses you choose require you to do; ask the staff if in doubt.  Talk to the university's \nstudent support or disabilities officer or your department's director of studies if you \n3 \nneed advice on whether or how you might cope.   The Disabled Students' Allowance \ncan take some time to process through an assessment centre, so apply in good time for \nthe start of session.  Other useful people to consult are the Library (e.g. dyslexia or \nvisual impairments or reaching books on top shelves); and the computer service if \nthere is IT equipment that might make life easier for you, but you are unsure of \ntechnicalities or compatibility.   \n     You might want to read some of the books about how to study geography at \nuniversity such as those by Kneale (2003) and Clark and Wareham (2003).  There are \nseveral websites that will help particularly those with disabilities and impairments \nsuch as those run by SKILL and TechDis.  The book and website To a Degree (Clark, \nWareham and Turner, 2006) is also useful.   \n \nStudents with dyslexia \nFor those with dyslexia, it is the word-intensive tasks that are the major hurdle.  For \nfieldwork and laboratory work instructions are usually succinct, and they can be \nchecked with the staff and fellow students to ensure you have not mis-interpreted \nanything.  In lectures focus on the key points.  Boil the ideas down to the fewest and \nmost important, perhaps using a mind-map or spider diagram to show how they fit \ntogether. If the lecturer produces notes in a handout or website, ensure you get a copy \nto re-read and annotate.   Ask if you can tape record lectures \u2013 you will probably be \nallowed to \u2013 as this will allow you to review the lecture later.   \n     Trying to be helpful, lecturers may provide long reading lists for the essays they \nset.  If a lot of reading can be taxing, do not hesitate to ask the lecturer to identify the \nkey texts from among those listed.  Again, finding the key points quickly is the key.  \nSo, look at the abstracts of articles and their concluding paragraphs (and similarly for \nbook chapters) to get the key ideas concisely.  \n     When you use a computer, it may be easier to work on screen if you alter the \ndefault settings in terms of the background colour of the screen, the typeface, type \ncolour and the point size.  If handouts on white paper are problematic, then you could \nask the department to print lecture handouts and module guides on coloured paper.  \n     Students assessed with dyslexia may be granted extra time to write their \nexamination answers; do ask your tutor if this would be useful for you.  \n \nStudents with hidden impairments  \nIf your impairment is not immediately obvious (as it is if you are the user of a wheel \nchair, for example), then the onus is on you to decide whom to tell and when.  If your \nepilepsy or diabetes is under control, perhaps no one need know.  But on a field visit, \nfar from the normal routine for managing your condition, an incident may be better \nhandled for all concerned if someone knows the right things to do to help you, should \nthe need arise.  Field work, including dissertations and placements, will usually be \nsubject to a risk assessment by the lecturer and students concerned.  Legally you need \nto factor into the planning any hidden conditions and show that you know how to deal \nwith them in the new circumstances of the field course.  If you have a stammer, \n4 \nworsened by stress, how are you going to do the interviews?  If your skin condition is \nexacerbated by strong sunlight, how will you cope on the field course to West Africa?  \nThere are ways of coping with such matters, but they need to be thought through \nexplicitly and in good time.  If arthritis slows your writing speed, you could ask for \nextra time or a scribe to write your examination answers at your dictation. These are \nstandard adjustments to examination procedures that are easily given when \nappropriate.  \n \nVisually impaired students \nMuch depends on your degree of visual impairment.  If partial, you could ask the staff \nto print out lecture notes, handouts and websites on bigger paper, enlarged or in \ndifferent colours.  Otherwise, you may ask the university's support service to arrange \nfor a note-taker to attend lectures and other classes with you.   The recording of \nlectures will normally be allowed \u2013 on tape or digitally.  The lecturer may be able to \nhelp too (if you remind him\/her gently) by describing in words what s\/he is showing \non slides, rather than just saying, \"...as you will see...\". \n     When it comes to doing the reading for essays, the lecturer can be asked to identify \nwhich of the items on perhaps long reading lists are the most important.  This will \nhelp you and your text reader, if your university can arrange the services of such a \nperson.  The Library may well have a machine to scan printed text and read it out in a \nsynthetic voice.  The Library may also be able to organise the translation of printed \ntext into braille or Moon.  Identifying the key texts is an important job for your tutor \nand planning early is beneficial to allow time for the brailling process to take place.  \n     For essays, a scribe to write as you dictate may be useful, while voice recognition \nsoftware is a possibility, although even with 'training' this software is not foolproof.  \nThe scribe may be able to help during examinations too, writing out your answer.   \n     If you have a guide dog, their welfare will need consideration from the start \u2013 \naccommodation and familiarisation with the layout of the university.  If you go on \nfield courses (especially overseas) the dog's needs in term of the climate, inoculations \nand food will have to be planned for.  \n     Fieldwork may pose other challenges for you, and your tutor will be able to talk \nyou through them.  Guidance, accommodation, access to your supportive equipment \u2013 \nall can be arranged if one starts early.  The same applies to your dissertation.  As \nshould all students, start the planning early, identify with your supervisor what would \nbe interesting to study, and work out the modifications to allow you to participate \nsafely and learn effectively.  Wherever you are \u2013 in the field, laboratory or lecture \ntheatre \u2013 make sure you, your fellow students and the tutor know where the fire exits \nare, just in case the worst happens.   \n \nHearing impaired students \nThe deaf and the Deaf are not the only one's who have difficulty hearing what staff \nsay at university.  The whirr of fans in air-conditioning systems, computers and \nprojectors creates a surprising amount of background noise which can drown out quiet \n5 \nspeakers. Hearing a lecturer while in the field can be similarly disrupted by street \nnoise, the wind or running water. \n     If your hearing is impaired, do ask the lecturer to use a microphone and T loop \nsystem.  Getting copies of lecture notes and items on module websites will be \nsimilarly helpful, however severe your degree of deafness.  If you lip read, you will \nneed to educate lecturers and fellow students in tutorial groups as to the etiquette on \nallowing unrestricted lip reading.  Place yourself in the teaching room where you can \ndo this best.  If you use a signer, then the university should be able to help recruit one \nfor you.  Your signer will need some training to familiarise themselves with new \ntechnical vocabularies. \n     When you are in discussion groups such as tutorials, you need to agree a \nconvention whereby people, say, raise a hand or lean forward when they want to make \na contribution, so no one \u2013 least of all you \u2013 gets left out.  \n     Similarly, during fieldwork, you need to participate and not get sidelined.  It may \nneed some negotiation to get a signer to accompany you in the field or on site visits or \nplacements.  With communication being difficult anyway in the field, the rule for \nteaching staff is to write down instructions, so there is no confusion.  If you are going \noverseas, note any differences in the compatibility of electrical equipment with UK \nstandards, and you will know already that British Sign Language is rarely used \noverseas.  \n     If you take modules involving laboratory work, then do ensure that you get a \nseparate orientation and safety briefing and know where the fire exits are.  It is \nparticularly important that safety information is clear to you; do check you have \nunderstood it and ask if not sure.  Your fellow students can help a lot here, but must \nnot take over from you.  During computer-based classes, you cannot look at the \ncomputer screen and the lecturer at the front of the class, so do ask for written \ninstructions. \n     For some people oral presentations can be problematic. Alternatives to consider \nare: using PowerPoint; or getting a BSL interpreter to speak your signed presentation. \n     If your written English could be better, do discuss alternative types of assessment \nwith your tutor, such as BSL presentations or more questions each requiring shorter \nanswers.  \n \nStudents with mobility impairments \nFor those with restricted mobility and particularly for those who use a wheelchair, \naccessibility has considerably improved during the last ten years \u2013 automatic doors, \nramps and lifts have been installed, for example.  But there can still be bottlenecks \u2013 \ndoors not wide enough for electric wheelchairs, for example, or access to tutorial \nrooms and laboratories.  So, it is still useful to check out locations beforehand.  Can \nyou see the projection screen from wherever the accessibility-friendly route leaves \nyou?  When lectures are held back to back in widely scattered venues across town, \nhave you got enough time to get from one to the other?   Do talk to your tutor if \naccessibility is a problem. \n6 \n     This is obviously particularly relevant advice for field courses and your \ndissertation.  The department should seek your views on issues such as getting on and \noff buses, walking around towns, and moving across rough country to field sites.  \nMany people may have limited mobility, not just those who use wheelchairs \u2013 those \nwith arthritis, a heart condition, agoraphobia or asthma, for example.  Options for \nalternative fieldwork could involve bringing the field samples to you rather than you \ntravelling to them; or similar fieldwork could be conducted in a more accessible \nlocation; or the department might arrange a virtual field course based at the university.  \nA less obvious issue is the degree of 'domestic privacy' you need on a residential field \nvisit.  If you opt for a placement during your degree scheme, then these discussions of \naccessibility will have to be held between you, your tutor and the prospective \nemployer. \n     It may be that modules involving laboratory work will need some careful thought \nin terms of laboratory bench heights and handling equipment.   The tutor will be able \nto advise you on how adjustments can be made to the task and equipment layout to \nensure you get an equivalent experience to the other students.  The same may apply to \ncomputer use \u2013 desk height, for example, or an adapted keyboard. \n     When it comes to essays and examinations, if arm strength or repetitive strain \ninjury are concerns, the university may allow you more time to write examination \nanswers or provide a scribe or typist to get your ideas on paper or into a computer.  \nDo ask if these ideas would help you.  \n     Oral presentations should not be a problem except that access to the lecture theatre \n(if that is where it is being held) may have been improved for 'the audience' but not \nfor the lecturer, so check out access to the lectern and audio-visual controls.  \n \nStudents with mental health conditions \nGeneral advice for those with mental health issues is tricky because conditions vary \nand really you are the expert in what is possible and tolerable.   \n     Sometimes stress is an unwelcome trigger, reducing one's ability to work.  Stress \ncan be minimised by asking for the deadlines for items of assessed work to be spread \nout more evenly.  In more serious cases part-time study may be more acceptable to \nyou.  Most universities offer the chance to intercalate, that is, to suspend your studies \nfor a period until your personal conditions allow uninterrupted and productive \nstudying.  Do ask about these options if you think they might help you. \n     You may not want your condition widely known, but if your attendance at classes \nor examinations is likely to be disrupted by absences or appointments, you should let \nthe Head of Department know, in confidence, so account can be taken.  The growth of \ninformation on departmental websites and copies of fellow students' notes will help \nyou catch up on missed sessions. \n     Residential field courses may be problematic for various reasons in terms of taking \nyou away from your known settings and support networks.   Do talk through the \npotential problems and possibilities with the tutor so that together you can judge \nwhether it is possible for you to attend (perhaps with adjustments to the arrangements) \nor whether an equivalent learning experience needs to be devised.  A single room for \n7 \naccommodation might be possible during a field course.  If you are on any medication \ndo remember to keep taking it as normal.   \n     Other types of teaching and assessment that might prove problematic include the \nfollowing.  \nGroup work \u2013 could a solo alternative be offered?  \nOral presentations \u2013 use PowerPoint or tape record your talk beforehand and just play \nit to the group?                                                                                                      \nEssays \u2013 resist the temptation to be a perfectionist; do your best, then hand it in.        \nExaminations and their time pressures and severe stress \u2013 could extra time be offered, \nor an alternative form of assessment be used? \n     For your dissertation, there are clear opportunities as well as a few difficult areas.  \nThe latter can be dealt with by planning ahead, spreading the workload and keeping \nyour supervisor in touch with developments.  The good aspects of a dissertation are \nthat you are in charge of the topic and how it is to be studied and you control the work \nrate.   \n \nA real life \nOutside your studies there has to be a real life for you.  Sport, paid employment or \npartying; volunteering or a hobby; it matters little what else you do as long as your \nlife at university is rich and full.  Geography (or any academic subject) will teach you \nmany skills, but for a full life and a good job you need to develop other qualities \u2013 \nhumanity, resilience, imagination, dedication, initiative \u2013 which a geography degree \nmay go some way to fostering, but which will really be developed through other \nactivities while at university.  Do try to enrich your life by participating in other \nspheres while at university.    \n \nHow everyone can help \nIt makes sense for students to help each other.  It may be either formal collaboration \nwhen working as a team set up by the staff, or just informal help between students.  \nThere may be cases \u2013 when doing solo coursework, for example \u2013 when everyone has \nto work alone to avoid the charge of collusion (copying each other's work); but that \nwill be made clear by the staff. \n    Always check out what help, if any, you or other people may need.  Needs are very \nindividual.  Help only when invited to (though you can offer assistance) and in the \nways the person needs.  Help, but don't take over.  Stand aside when help is not \nneeded unless there is a clear safety issue emerging.  Train others in the help you \nneed.  A good guideline is to find ways around the problems so the person can still do \nthe work, rather than by sidelining them by doing the job yourself. \n  \nWords and language \n8 \n \nIn this paper I have tried to use language sensitively.  I am aware, however, of clear \ndivisions among and beyond those immediately concerned as to the most appropriate \nwords to use when discussing these topics.  I have tried to follow current generally \naccepted practice; if you feel that I have failed in some respects, I can only apologise. \n \nReferences \n \nClark, G. & Wareham, T.
