It has been shown\nthat, in the example, the actuator as designed does\nsatisfy the static force requirements and thus should\nbe capable of effecting adequate operation of the\narmature. However, in practice the control design to\nachieve all the project performance objectives was\nproving difficult to achieve. In general the multi-\nobjective controllability analysis would have been\nperformed before the manufacture of experimental\nactuators, and an iterative process performed with\nfinite element analysis to achieve a controllable\nsystem.
