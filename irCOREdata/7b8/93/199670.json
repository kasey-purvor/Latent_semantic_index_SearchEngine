(227 words) \n \n \n \n \nKeywords: Dementia, long-term care, expenditure. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3 \nIntroduction \n \nEstimates for England project that between 2002 and 2031 the number of people aged 65 \nor over will rise by 63%. The numbers aged 85 or more are projected to rise faster, by \n123% (GAD, 2005). The numbers of older people with cognitive impairment are also \nexpected to rise: Wancata et al (2003) project that the number of people with dementia in \nEurope will grow from 7.6 million prevalent cases in 2000 to 16.2 million in 2050.  \n \nCognitive impairment has substantial impacts on quality of life for individuals, families \nand other caregivers. It also has major implications for health and social services, in turn \ngenerating high costs (Sou\u00eatre et al, 1999, McNamee et al, 1999 and 2001, Kavanagh and \nKnapp, 2002, Schneider et al, 2003). It is clearly important, for strategic planning \npurposes, to estimate likely future service requirements. It is also important, in the context \nof debates about how to fund long-term care (LTC), to project the associated expenditure. \n \nThis paper presents projections, for the next 25 years, of future numbers of older people \nwith cognitive impairment in England, their demand for formal LTC services and \nassociated expenditure under a range of assumptions. The assumptions relate to trends in \nfactors that affect future LTC expenditure, including trends in numbers of older people, \nprevalence rates of cognitive impairment, household composition, informal care \nprovision, care service patterns and unit costs. \n \nProjections cover residential and community-based services, both long-term health \nservices and social services. Informal care is also considered. Expenditure projections \ncover public expenditure by health and social services and private expenditure by \nindividuals. Informal care costs are not included nor are general living costs of people \nliving in the community.  \n \nThe projections were produced using a macrosimulation (cell-based) model, based on the \nLTC projections model constructed by the Personal Social Services Research Unit \n(PSSRU) as part of its Department of Health -funded programme (Wittenberg et al 1998, \n2001, 2006).  \n 4 \n \nMethods \n \nData \n \nThe model requires data on older people\u2019s characteristics, including health status and \nsocio-economic situation, their use of LTC services and the associated costs. No single \ndataset in England has all the information needed, so we used data from a range of \nsources chosen on the basis of quality and coverage.  \n \nThe model uses GAD projections of the numbers of older people in England to 2031 by \nage band and gender taking 2002 as the base year (GAD, 2005), and marital status and \ncohabitation projections to 2031 from a 2003 base (ONS, 2005). \n \nThe model employs data on prevalence of cognitive impairment and physical disability, \nuse of services and other characteristics of people with cognitive impairment from the \nMRC CFAS study. This study collected information about incidence and prevalence of \ncognitive decline and dementia, identified factors associated with the risk of dementia, \nand evaluated the degree of disability associated with cognitive decline and the service \nneeds generated (MRC CFAS, 1998a). It found no heterogeneity between different sites, \nwhich gave the MRC CFAS team confidence to generalise their prevalence estimates. In \nfour sites (Cambridgeshire, Nottingham, Newcastle, Oxford) the resource implications of \nfunctional or cognitive frailty were investigated in the Resource Implication Study (RIS) \n(McNamee et al, 1999 and 2001), based on a sample of 10,377 people aged 65 years and \nover, 1,446 of whom were classified as disabled, and for 1,391 of whom the RIS collected \nservice monitoring data.  \n \nOur model uses GHS data on household composition, functional disability, receipt of \ninformal help and receipt of formal non-residential services. The 2001\/2 GHS included \n3,356 people aged 65 years and over in private households in Great Britain. Of these, \n3,213 provided information on ability to perform tasks and on use of community care \nservices (Walker et al, 2003). \n \nFor numbers of people in residential homes and nursing homes we use Department of \nHealth (2003) data. Data on age, gender, cognitive impairment, previous household \ncomposition and previous housing tenure of care home residents are taken from PSSRU \nsurveys (Netten et al, 1998 and 2001 and Darton et al, 2006). We also use data from the \n2001 Census for information about people in hospitals for long-stays. \n \nFinally, information from the PSSRU annual unit costs volume (Curtis and Netten, 2004) \nand from Laing and Buisson (2004) is used to cost services. Information about housing \ntenure by age, gender and household composition was obtained from the 2002 Family \nResources Survey. \n \nWe sought to use best available data for each part of the model, as detailed below. In \ngeneral, more recent sources, such as the GHS, are used as the primary data source, with \nless recent sources, such as CFAS, used for more detailed subdivisions of service users. \n \nOverview of the model \n \n 5 \nThe model makes projections for England to 2031 of three key variables: expected \nnumber of older people with cognitive impairment, their likely level of demand for LTC \nservices and costs associated with meeting this demand.  \n  \nThe model has three parts: the first divides the projected older population into cells by \nage, gender, cognitive impairment and\/or functional disability, household composition \nand housing tenure; the second focuses on receipt of LTC services by attaching a \nprobability of service receipt to each cell; the third estimates expenditures on services.   \n \nThe model makes projections under different scenarios. It should be stressed that we do \nnot aim to make forecasts about what will happen in the future. Rather, we make \nprojections, rooted in the present demand and use of services, that investigate the impact \nof specific assumptions about future trends. The approach involves simulating the impact \non demand of specified changes in demand drivers, such as demographic pressures, \nchanges in household composition, or specified changes in patterns of care, such as more \nsupport for informal carers. We do not forecast future policies or care patterns.  \n \n \nOlder people with cognitive impairment and their characteristics  \n \nCognitive impairment and functional disability \n \nThe numbers of older people by age and gender projected by GAD (2005) are split into \nthose with cognitive impairment only, those with combined cognitive impairment and \nfunctional disability (defined in terms of ability to perform activities of daily living), \nthose with functional disability only and those with neither cognitive impairment nor \nfunctional disability. The model uses, for this purpose, data on prevalence from the four \nCFAS RIS sites (Melzer et al, 1999). People were classified as disabled in this study if \nthey were identified as functionally\n1\n or cognitively frail. People were considered to be \ncognitively impaired as assessed by a score of three or more on the Automated Geriatric \nExamination Computer Assisted Taxonomy (AGECAT) (Copeland et al 1986). They \nwere considered to have functional disability if they scored seven or less on the modified \nTownsend Disability Scale (MRC CFAS, 1998b). Table 1 presents the prevalence \nestimates\n2\n used in the model.  \n \nTable 1 here \n \nHousehold composition and informal care \n \nHousehold composition is an important structural correlate of informal care (Pickard et al, \n2000). Informal care is combined with household composition in a four-fold \nclassification: living alone without informal help; living alone with informal help; single, \nwidowed or divorced (de facto single) living with others; and married\/cohabiting couple \n(including couples living with others). Household compositions where older people live \nwith others have not been broken down between those with and without informal carers \n                                                          \n1\n Melzer and others (1999) refer to having difficulties with activities of daily living as having \u201cphysical\u201d \nfrailty. We use the term \u201cfunctional\u201d disability, as difficulty in performing activities of daily living can also \nstem from severe cognitive impairment. \n2\n People who, because of their advanced cognitive impairment, were not able to answer the activities of \ndaily living (ADL) questions are included in the combined disability group, following Melzer et al (1999). \n 6 \nbecause those living with others have a potential carer and most of those who are disabled \nhave an actual carer\n3\n.  To split the population by age, gender and disability into household \ncomposition\/informal care groups, data from the 2001\/2 GHS and RIS CFAS were used \nfor people in households. Data from the Census 2001 and the PSSRU 1996 residential \ncare survey (Netten et al, 1998 and 2001) were used to divide those in care homes \naccording to previous household characteristics. \n \nHousing tenure \n \nThe model includes, for people in private households, a simple breakdown by housing \ntenure between owner-occupied tenure and rented accommodation. Housing tenure is \nincluded as a proxy for socio-economic group and because home owners are less likely to \nmove to care homes than those in rented accommodation (Hancock et al., 2003).  \n \nProportions of older people, by age band and household composition, living in owner-\noccupier and rented tenure were derived by analysis of the 2002 Family Resources \nSurvey. Projected rates to 2022 are from projections by Hancock et al (2006), derived \nfrom a microsimulation model, assuming that housing tenure remains constant after 2022. \n \nProjected demand for long-term care services \n \nThe second part of the model projects volumes of services demanded. Outputs of the first \npart of the model (numbers of older people by disability, household composition\/informal \ncare and other characteristics) were combined with functions that assign receipt of services \nto each sub-group.   \n \nThe model includes key formal non-residential social services (home care, day care, \nmeals) and health services (day hospital, community nursing, chiropody). Private \ndomestic help is included, though this should be treated with caution as it may not relate \nto care needs. Residential, nursing home and long-stay hospital care are included. \n \nThe probability of receiving each service by age, gender, household composition, \ndisability and housing tenure was estimated separately for non-residential and residential \nservices. For non-residential services the primary data source was GHS 2001\/2. First, the \nprobability of receipt of each service was estimated through multivariate (logistic \nregression) analysis: independent variables were age, gender, level of functional \ndisability, household type\/informal care and housing tenure. Estimates from the analysis \nwere then applied to the population to estimate overall numbers of older people receiving \neach service by age group, gender, functional disability, household type\/informal care and \nhousing tenure. \n \nRIS CFAS data were used to split the recipients of each service according to type of \ndisability (cognitive impairment and\/or functional disability). This analysis was \nconducted by age and gender4. Table 2 shows the proportion of recipients of non-\n                                                          \n3\n In the 2001\/2 General Household Survey (GHS), over 90% of functionally disabled older people living \nwith others reported receiving informal help with domestic tasks.  \n4\n For users of each service, logistic regression analysis was conducted with dependent variable being \nwhether the person had cognitive impairment. Explanatory variables were age, gender, household \ntype\/informal care and housing tenure. For most services the proportion of service recipients in the RIS data \nwith cognitive impairment varied with age and gender but not with other variables. \n 7 \nresidential services (except for chiropody) by disability type. Most service recipients \nbelong to the group with functional disability only, reflecting the higher prevalence of \nfunctional disability (see table 1). \n \nTable 2 here \n \nData for residential services from the Department of Health (2003) were used to estimate \nnumbers in care homes. Data from PSSRU residential care surveys in 1996 and 2005 \n(Netten et al, 1998, 2001; Darton et al., 2006), the 2001 Census and RIS CFAS data for \ninstitutional care were used to split care home residents according to their characteristics \n(Comas-Herrera et al 2003). \n \nThe estimated proportion of each sub-group (defined by age, gender, household \ncomposition, disability, housing tenure) receiving each service was then held constant for \nfuture years. This means that projections are based on recent care patterns, except where \nchanges in these patterns are specifically investigated. \n \nProjected aggregate expenditure on LTC services \n \nThe third part of the model projects total expenditure, at constant 2002 prices, on formal \nservices. Projected levels of services are multiplied by their estimated unit costs. Estimated \nexpenditure on home care and community nursing services has been grossed up broadly to \nmatch official data. Separate expenditure projections were produced for services for older \npeople with and without cognitive impairment. We include public and private expenditure on \nlong-term health and social services.  \n \nProjections for future years should take account of expected rises in real unit costs of care, \nwhich are likely to be affected by factors such as future real wages and other input prices, \nefficiency and quality of care. As LTC services are highly labour-intensive, future real wages \nare probably the key factor. We assumed, as a base case, that real unit costs will rise annually \nby 2%, in line with the Treasury\u2019s assumption for real rises in earnings. Real Gross Domestic \nProduct (GDP) is assumed to rise in line with Treasury assumptions of 2% p.a. in the \nmedium to long-term (HM Treasury, 2005). \n \n \nBase case assumptions and projections \n \nThe base case assumptions are summarised in box 1 (Wittenberg et al., 1998). This base \ncase is a starting point for examination of the assumptions used in the model, not a \nprediction of the future. It is a point of comparison when assumptions are subsequently \nvaried in alternative scenarios. The assumptions keep most policy-related variables \nconstant and use Government assumptions for demographic changes. \n \n \nBox 1: Main base case assumptions  \n \n\uf0b7 The older population changes in line with the GAD 2004-based principal population \nprojection. \n\uf0b7 Age\/gender-specific prevalence rates of cognitive impairment and functional disability remain \nunchanged. \n 8 \n\uf0b7 Marital status rates change in line with GAD 2003-based marital status and cohabitation \nprojections. \n\uf0b7 There is a constant ratio of single people living alone to single people living with others. \n\uf0b7 The proportion of older people receiving informal care, formal community care services and \nresidential and nursing home care remains constant by age, disability, household composition and \nother needs-related circumstances. \n\uf0b7 Health and social care unit costs rise by 2% p.a. in real terms. Real GDP rises in line with \nTreasury assumptions. \n\uf0b7 Formal care supply will adjust to match demand5 and demand will be no more constrained by \nsupply in the future than in the base year. \n \n \nThe model projects that, under these base case assumptions, between 2002 and 2031 the \nnumbers of people with cognitive impairment in England will rise from 468,000 to \n855,000 (83% increase), 430,000 of whom will also have functional disability. The \nnumber of hours of home care arranged by local authorities for older people with \ncognitive impairment would need to rise by 91% to keep pace with these demographic \npressures. The numbers of people with cognitive impairment in care homes would rise by \n88%, from an estimate of 205,000 in 2002 to 385,000 in 2031.  \n \nExpenditure on LTC for older people with cognitive impairment in England\n6\n is projected \nto rise from \u00a35.4 billion in 2002 to \u00a316.7 billion in 2031 at constant 2002 prices (Figure \n1), under base case assumptions. This amounts to a rise from 0.60% to 0.96% of GDP\n7\n \n(Table 3).   \n \nTable 3 here. \n \nThe estimate for 2031 of \u00a316.7 billion for LTC expenditure for people with cognitive \nimpairment produced using this updated version of the model is substantially higher than the \n\u00a310.9 billion estimate projected by a previous version based on year 2000 data (Comas-\nHerrera et al. 2003). This difference is due, mostly, to a new GAD population projection \n(which assumes a greater increase in numbers of older people), an increase in the proportion \nof people in care homes with severe cognitive impairment (Darton et al., 2006), and \nespecially a revised assumption about future growth in unit costs. The earlier estimates were \ncomparable to those obtained by McNamee et al (2001). Their demographic model estimated \nthe projected costs of formal care for people with cognitive impairment to be \u00a311.2 billion, \nbut they included acute health service costs, as well as using a different methodology. \n \n \nSensitivity analysis \n \nChanges in numbers of people with cognitive impairment \n \nOne of the main influences on demand for LTC for older people and associated \nexpenditure will be the number of older people with cognitive impairment. This depends \non future mortality and prevalence rates. Figure 2 shows projected long-term care \n                                                          \n5\n The model effectively assumes that the real rise in unit costs of care is sufficient to ensure that supply at \nleast meets demand. \n6\n In 2002\/3 prices, i.e. with expected real increases but not nominal changes in care costs. \n7\n Used as an indication of the economy\u2019s capacity to meet expenditure. \n 9 \nexpenditure in England as a percentage of GDP under different assumptions. The second \nand third columns show the impact of using high and low life expectancy variants: the \nimpact on future expenditure is relatively small\n8\n.  \n \nThe fourth column shows the impact of an annual 1% decline in prevalence of cognitive \nimpairment only, and the last column shows the impact of an annual 1% decline in \nprevalence of combined cognitive impairment and functional disability. This latter \nassumption illustrates the impact of a delay in progression of cognitive impairment to \nmore severe stages. A decline in prevalence of combined cognitive impairment and \nfunctional disability of this magnitude would have a substantial impact on projected \nexpenditure, as it would reduce substantially the numbers in care homes or using very \nintensive home care packages. \n \nChanges in informal care availability and formal care patterns \n \nDemand for LTC services depends partly on availability of care by family and friends. \nFigure 3 shows projected LTC expenditure in England as a percentage of GDP under \ndifferent assumptions about informal and formal care provision.  \n \nThe model takes into account the effects of future changes in marital status on informal \ncare and household composition. Whereas there is likely to be an increase in spouse carers \nof disabled older people, there is considerable uncertainty about future provision of \nintensive informal care by children (Pickard et al, 2000). The second column in figure 3 \nshows the impact of a hypothetical decline by one third in the proportion of single \ndisabled older people living with others by 2031. It assumes that older people who no \nlonger move in with their children instead move into residential homes. The impact is \nslight, primarily because the number of older people co-residing with their children is \nalready small. \n \nThe third column shows the potential impact of a larger fall in informal care supply, \nwhere it is assumed that people currently living with others have the same probability of \ngoing into an institution as those living alone. The impact of this assumption is more \nsubstantial. Expenditure on LTC for those with cognitive impairment is projected to \nrepresent 1.11% of GDP in 2031 under this scenario, compared with 0.96% under the \nbase case. \n \nThere may also be changes affecting future patterns of formal care. The fourth column in \nFigure 3 shows the impact of increased formal support to carers. This assumption \ninvestigates the implications of giving older people with combined cognitive impairment \nand functional disability who live with others the same packages of non-residential \nservices as received by those living alone (a so-called \u2018carer-blind\u2019 assumption). The \nimpact is modest. \n \nChanges in unit costs \n \nExpenditure projections over an extended period are inevitably sensitive to assumptions \nabout real rises in unit costs. The model assumes, as a base case, that unit costs of care \nwill rise in line with the projected rate of earnings growth in the overall economy (using \n                                                          \n8\n Due to the relatively narrow assumed range of life expectancy at birth explored in these projections. \n 10 \nHM Treasury assumption of 2% per year). The first variant assumption examined was that \nthe real rise in unit costs would be lower, at 1.5% per year. This could occur if \nimprovements could be achieved in the efficiency of care services. Under this assumption \nLTC expenditure for older people with cognitive impairment would represent 0.83% of \nGDP in 2031. The second variant assumption is that real unit costs rise faster than \nexpected earnings, by 2.5% per year. This assumption illustrates a possible impact of \nincreases in real costs as a result of, for example, improvements in service quality or \nhigher labour costs due to workforce shortages. Under this assumption LTC expenditure \nfor people with cognitive impairment would represent 1.11% of GDP in 2031.  \n \nProjected future LTC expenditure is clearly highly sensitive to the assumed rate of growth \nin real unit costs. \n \n \nDiscussion \n \nLimitations \n \nThe model\u2019s projections are as good as the data used; as no single recent data source \ncontained all necessary information, we drew on a number of sources. Some data covered \ndifferent populations, collected at different points of time. We have tried to address the \nresultant comparability issue by primarily using nationally representative, recent sources \n(to estimate, for example, total service use at baseline) and older sources as second-line \n(mostly to split service users between those with cognitive impairment and those with \nother types of disability).  \n \nOur expenditure projections do not cover the total societal costs of cognitive impairment. \nThat would require inclusion of a wider range of costs (such as housing, medicines and the \nopportunity costs of informal care). This would produce substantially higher estimates. \nIncluding the opportunity costs of informal care would be challenging given the difficulties \nof measurement (McDaid, 2001). \n \nNo allowance has been made for changes in public expectations about the quality, range \nor level of care. The base case projections assume an unchanged relationship between \nreceipt of care and age, gender, disability, household composition and housing tenure. \nRising expectations, associated with rising real incomes of older people, could clearly \nhave a substantial impact on future LTC demand, resulting in substantially higher \nexpenditure estimates.  \n \nFuture mortality and prevalence rates and rises in unit care costs, which are inevitably \nuncertain, have substantial implications for future LTC demand and associated \nexpenditure. This is on the basis of univariate sensitivity analysis, where each factor is \nconsidered separately. Multivariate sensitivity analyses, in which variant assumptions are \ntested for two or more factors together, could show even greater variability in projected \nexpenditure. We are conducting further research into the sensitivity of these projections to \nmultivariate scenarios chosen by a panel of experts. \n \nSocial and policy implications \n \n 11 \nThe model projects that, unless more effective treatments for cognitive impairment are \ndeveloped and made widely available, the numbers of older people with cognitive \nimpairment will rise significantly over the next 30 years. Substantial increases in formal \nservices will therefore be required. The model also shows that, if current or future \ntreatments were to reduce prevalence rates of combined cognitive impairment and \nfunctional disability by 1% per year, this would nearly offset expected demographic \npressures. One implication is that investment in developing, and making widely available, \nbetter treatments to slow down the progression of dementia could substantially reduce \nexpenditure growth. \n \nInformal carers provide much of the support for older people with cognitive impairment \nliving at home. We did not estimate or project the value (or costs) of such informal care, \nalthough the model allows expenditure projections as a result of a possible future decline \nin informal care supply. The projections suggest that such a decline, resulting in increased \nadmissions to residential care, could have substantial financial consequences. The \nprojections also suggest that the financial consequences of providing more support for \ncarers in the form of home-based services provided on a \u2018carer-blind\u2019 basis would be \nlower than the costs of a decline in informal care resulting in increased \ninstitutionalisation. This illustrates the value of developing services to support informal \ncarers as well meeting the needs of older people. \n  \nThe projections show that the proportion of GDP required to fund LTC services will rise \nsignificantly. Improving the efficiency of services would help to limit rises in unit costs, \nthough the scope for this may be limited. More generally, improving the cost-\neffectiveness with which needs are met would obviously be attractive.  \n \nOur projections also highlight the importance of promoting the sustainability of funding \nfor long-term care for older people (Wittenberg et al, 2002). Since the Royal Commission \n(1999) report there has been a lively debate about the long-term care financing in the UK, \nto which the Wanless Review of Social Care (Wanless and Forder, 2006) contributed \nsignificantly by recommending radical changes to the financing system.  \n \n \n 12 \nAcknowledgments \n \nThis research was financed by the Alzheimer\u2019s Research Trust.
