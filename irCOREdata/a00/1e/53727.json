This may be of clinical and prognostic utility \nin identifying which patients with uncomplicated ISVI are at highest risk of tissue \nbreakdown and ulcer formation in the gaiter area. \n \nKey Words: Endothelial function; microvascular; venous insufficiency; ulceration; \n3 \nIntroduction \nGravitational ulceration around the gaiter area of the lower limb (above the medial or \nlateral malleolus) due to primary venous insufficiency is a common disabling \ncondition that is difficult to treat once established and prone to recurrence [1].  The \nunderlying mechanisms of tissue breakdown and ulcer formation are complex and not \nclearly understood, but microangiopathy involving structural and functional \nabnormalities is an established feature of venous hypertension [2] and a possible \ntarget for therapeutic intervention [3].  \n \nTissue viability and susceptibility to ulceration depend upon many factors, but \ncutaneous microvascular perfusion and in particular the integrity of compensatory \nvasodilator mechanisms to maintain blood flow, tissue oxygenation and nutrient \ndelivery despite changes in systemic and local haemodynamics may be especially \nimportant [4].  For example, it has been shown that reduced vasodilator capacity in \nresponse to warming correlates with low transcutaneous oxygen tension in the \nperimalleolar tissues [5], but very little is known about how microvascular \nvasorelaxation is dependent upon endothelial function, posture (i.e neural reflex \npathways) and\/or defects in the underlying vascular smooth muscle.   \n \nAlthough laser techniques have been available for many years, recent technological \nimprovements in laser Doppler fluximetry (LDF) and the associated analytical \nsoftware offer more reliable methods and applications for studying microvascular \nvasodilator pathways in clinical studies, e.g by combining LDF with iontophoretic \nadministration of vasoactive drugs [6].  Thus, the purpose of the present study was to \ncompare cutaneous microvascular perfusion around the gaiter area in the supine and \n4 \nupright positions in patients with isolated superficial venous insufficiency (ISVI) and \nnormal healthy subjects, and to assess the effects of ISVI and posture on both \nendothelial-dependent and endothelial-independent vasodilator mechanisms. \n \nMethods \nPatients with uncomplicated ISVI, i.e long or short saphenous vein reflux confirmed \nby Duplex scanning, were recruited from referrals to the Vascular Laboratory at \nDerbyshire Royal Infirmary.  Patients with present or past venous ulceration, arterial \ndisease, or major skin changes in the gaiter area were excluded.  Healthy control \nsubjects were recruited from the research database in the Division of Vascular \nMedicine, and the absence of ISVI among control subjects was confirmed by Duplex \nscanning.  All volunteers provided written informed consent, and a detailed clinical \nprotocol was approved by the Southern Derbyshire Research Ethics committee.  \nFollowing a baseline screening visit, which included measurements of height, weight \nand BP, each subject attended the Clinical Research Unit for a single study morning \nundertaken in a temperature-controlled room according to a standard protocol. \n \nStudy periods \nPatients acclimatised to the room during a 30min period of supine rest with the leg to \nbe studied supported at a 30\no\n angle.  The gaiter area was cleaned with alcohol and \ndried thoroughly before applying two perspex iontophoresis chambers (Moor \nInstruments Ltd, Axminster, UK) to the surface of the leg 4-8 cm proximal to the \nmedial malleolus.  The chambers were positioned over healthy looking skin, approx. \n2-5 cm apart.  0.25ml of 1% acetylcholine (Ach) (Sigma Chemicals, UK) and 1% \nsodium nitroprusside (SNP) (Nipride, Roche Pharmaceuticals Ltd) diluted in \n5 \ndeionised HPLC-grade water was then injected into the anodal and cathodal \niontophoresis chambers, respectively, and a laser Doppler probe positioned through \nthe centre of each chamber.  The chambers were no more than 4cm apart and \npositioned over healthy skin (avoiding any area of lipodermatosclerosis or superficial \nveins).  After achieving a stable recording of baseline flux, LDF responses to \ntranscutaneous administration of the endothelial-dependent vasodilator Ach and the \nendothelial-independent vasodilator SNP were measured using an incremental-dose \niontophoresis protocol [7].  Thereafter, following 10 mins recovery and stabilisation \nof baseline flux recordings in the standing position, repeat measurements of \nvasodilator responses were performed with the subject upright.   \n \nThe DRT4 LDF system was utilised for all studies (Moor Instruments, Axminster, \nUK), together with the Moor Instruments iontophoresis controller and the DRT4 \nsoftware for automated data analysis of skin temperature, flux and microvascular \ndose-response curves for each iontophoretic challenge.   \n \nIncremental microvascular dose-response analysis \nThe principle of drug iontophoresis is that an electrical potential difference will \nactively cause ions in solution to migrate according to their electrical charge.  The \nmagnitude of the electrical charge (Q) is therefore dependent upon length of time (t) a \ncurrent (I) is passed (i.e Q = It, where charge is quantified in coulombs, current in \namps and time in seconds).  Thus, duration and current influence the dose of agonist \nthat is delivered. \n \n6 \nIn this study, the iontophoresis controller (Moor Instruments) delivered low electrical \ncurrents of preset intensity for a specified duration.  Each current stimulus was \nfollowed by a period of laser Doppler recording to monitor the time-dependent \nmicrovascular flow response.  Following a stable baseline recording, dose-response \ncurves for Ach and SNP induced vasodilation were characterised using incremental \ncharges according to a standard protocol, as described previously [7]:  25\uf06dA for 10s \n(ie 250\uf06dC), 50\uf06dA for 10s (500\uf06dC), 100\uf06dA for 10s (1000\uf06dC), and 100\uf06dA for 20s \n(2000\uf06dC), with a 4-min recording period between each electrical charge. \n \nStatistical analysis \nA LDF commercial software system (Moorsoft V1, Moor Instruments, UK) was used \nto provide automated analysis of the microvascular Doppler flow responses to \nincremental doses of each agonist, and the data (maximum perfusion measured in \nPerfusion Units [PU]) for individual subjects was then downloaded to a PC for \ncomparison between groups using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-test and \nwithin groups using ANOVA for repeated measures. Both Clinical data and the \nvasodilator responses for each incremental charge are presented as mean + SEM. \n \nResults \nTwenty-five patients with ISVI and 28 control subjects without ISVI participated in \nthe study.  The clinical and demographic details are presented in Table 1. \n \nEffects of posture on endothelial-dependent & -independent vasodilator responses \nIn control subjects, rising from the supine to the standing position was associated with \na significant reduction in baseline cutaneous flux at both perimalleolar probes (Figure \n7 \n1), typical of the normal venoarteriolar response to upright posture [8].  However, this \nreduction in cutaneous perfusion appeared to be fully overcome by the endothelial-\ndependent vasodilator Ach:  peak microvascular responses to Ach were similar in the \nstanding compared with the supine position (Figure 1).  In contrast, perfusion \nresponses to each dose of SNP were attenuated in the standing position (Figure 1). \n \nA similar venoarteriolar reflex was also demonstrated in patients with ISVI:  baseline \ncutaneous perfusion was significantly reduced when patients moved from the supine \nto the standing position, and the upright response to SNP was blunted (Figure 2).  \nHowever, in contrast to the healthy controls, stimulation with Ach did not overcome \nthe effect of posture on cutaneous perfusion: Ach-induced vasodilation was \nsignificantly reduced in the standing position (Figure 2). \n \nEffects of ISVI on endothelial-dependent and \u2013independent vasodilator responses \nBaseline (resting) cutaneous perfusion in the gaiter area, both in the supine and \nstanding positions, was no different in patients with ISVI compared with controls.  \nWith subjects supine (i.e without the venoarteriolar reflex active) endothelial-\ndependent vasodilation to incremental doses of Ach was similar in patients vs controls \n(e.g peak Ach response was 105+9 PU [ISVI] vs 121+11 PU, p=0.27) (Figure 3), \nwhereas the peak vasodilator response to SNP was significantly lower in the presence \nof venous disease (123+15 PU vs 152+12 PU, p<0.05) (Figure 3). \n \nWhen subjects moved to the standing position and the venoarteriolar (vasoconstrictor) \nreflex was activated, there was no difference in vasodilator responses to SNP between \nthe two groups, i.e endothelial-independent vasodilation was equally blunted in \n8 \npatients and controls.  However, the endothelial-dependent vasodilator response to \nAch in the upright position was significantly lower in patients with ISVI (69+8 PU vs \n109+11 PU, p<0.05) (Figure 3). \n \n \nDiscussion \nThis study provides several important observations about the inter-play of endothelial \nfunction, posture and vascular smooth muscle tone in the regulation of microvascular \nfunction in control subjects and in patients at risk of perimalleolar ulceration due to \nlower limb venous insufficiency.  Firstly, in the supine position resting cutaneous \nperfusion in the gaiter area was similar in patients with ISVI compared with controls, \nand the two groups showed similar incremental responses to the endothelial-\ndependent vasodilator Ach.  Absolute skin flux, even in healthy individuals, is lower \nin the gaiter area compared with the shin or the dorsum of the foot [9], which no \ndoubt explains in part why this region is so vulnerable to tissue breakdown.  Although \nresting perfusion is often increased over areas affected by lipodermatosclerosis or \nulceration [10], the result of this study contrasts with earlier suggestions that even \nmild venous insufficiency is associated with cutaneous hyperaemia [11]. \n \nWhereas Ach-induced vasodilation in larger conduit vessels is mediated almost \nentirely by endothelial release of nitric oxide (NO), the mechanisms involved in \ncutaneous microvessels are less clear.  It seems likely, however, that Ach-induced \nrelease of vasodilator prostanoids and\/or endothelium-derived hyperpolarising factor \n(EDHF) is more important than NO [12].  Thus, under conditions of supine rest and \nstandardised temperature-control there was no evidence of impaired endothelial-\n9 \ndependent vasodilation in patients with ISVI.  A similar result was reported after \niontophoretic administration of a single-dose of pilocarpine [13].  These observations \nare especially relevant to the on-going debate about what causes ISVI, in particular \nsuggestions that endothelial dysfunction and venous dilatation (rather than valve \nfailure) might be primary mechanisms in the pathogenesis of varicose veins [14]. \n \nCutaneous vasoconstriction in response to standing is often referred to as the \nvenoarteriolar reflex (or \u2018oedema protection reflex\u2019) [8].  Local neuro-vascular \nmechanisms, including the sympathetic nervous system, cause vasoconstriction in \nresponse to venous hypertension and thus buffer the rise in capillary pressure and \ntransudation of fluid into the surrounding tissues.  There have been various reports \nthat the venoarteriolar reflex is either intact [15] or impaired [16] in patients with \nISVI, the latter possibly due in part to a form of neuropathy affecting small \nunmyelinated C-fibres in patients with venous disease [17].  In the present study, \nhowever, ISVI had no effect on the normal vasoconstrictor response to standing. \n \nIn control subjects and in those with venous insufficiency, the venoarteriolar reflex \neffectively blunted the vasodilator response at all doses of SNP, presumably by \nincreasing background sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone on vascular smooth muscle. \nThis would be consistent with noradrenergic mechanisms, activated by standing, \nopposing the direct vasorelaxant effect of SNP on vascular smooth muscle.  However, \nit notable that upright responses to SNP were equally blunted, relative to supine \nresponses, in both patients with ISVI and controls, i.e this effect of posture was not \naugmented or diminished by coexistent venous disease. \n \n10 \nThere were interesting differences between the groups with respect to Ach-induced \nvasodilation in the upright position.  Firstly, in healthy subjects, Ach stimulation \ncompletely reversed the effect of the venoarteriolar reflex: peak vasodilator responses \nto Ach in the standing position (with the venoarteriolar reflex activated) were almost \nidentical to those in the supine position (when the reflex was not active).  This was \nnot the case in patients with ISVI, where maximal Ach-induced vasodilation was \nsignificantly lower in the upright compared with the supine position.  Several \nobservations can be made about this result.  Firstly, from the baseline flux \nmeasurements and the SNP data it seems unlikely that the venoarteriolar reflex was \nincreased in patients with venous insufficiency.  Instead, Ach-induced release of \nEDHF from the microvascular endothelium, and\/or EDHF responsiveness of the \nvessel wall, may be reduced under conditions of raised venous pressure. \n \nThus, the present study has shown that there is impaired endothelium-dependent \nvasodilation around the gaiter area in patients with ISVI when venous pressure is \nhigh, e.g in the upright position.  This suggests that standing is associated with \nimpairment of a compensatory mechanism which is probably important for \nmaintaining tissue perfusion and viability in venous insufficiency.  Further studies \nshould address whether impaired Ach-induced vasodilation in the upright position is \nof prognostic utility, perhaps providing a non-invasive measure of high ulcer risk \namong patients with uncomplicated ISVI. \n \n \n \n \n11 \nReferences \n1.
