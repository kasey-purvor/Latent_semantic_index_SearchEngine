This study explores a multiple assessment approach  to  identify  the  strengths  and\nweaknesses of site-based interpretation in influencing multi-dimensional aspects  of  attitudes  and\nbehavioral intentions towards local environmental issues. Visitors to the Lulworth coastal  area  in\nEngland were studied using on-site questionnaire survey data. The results of the research highlight\nthat the effectiveness  of  interpretation  varied  in  relation  to  a  number  of  different  aspects  of\nresponsible environmental behavior and local conservation issues. The findings also reveal  that  it\nfostered visitors\u2019 awareness of and their support  for  management  policies  but  its  impacts  were\nlimited to site-specific responsible behavior related in this case  to  geological  and  environmental\nconservation.\nKeywords:\nInterpretation; Environmental attitudes; Responsible behavior; Environmental\nConservation; Nature-based tourism\nINTRODUCTION\nIn nature-based tourism areas, tourism planners have often turned to interpretation as a key  visitor\nmanagement  tool  in  managing  the  balance  between  tourism  development  and  environmental\nprotection (Kuo, 2002; Newsome,  Moor,  and  Dowling,  2002).  The  management  objectives  of\ninterpretation  have  been  reshaped  from  their  educational  origins,  which  Tilden  described  as\naiming \u2018to reveal meanings and relationships  through  the  use  of  original  objects  by  first-hand\nexperience,  and  by  illustrative  media\u2019  (1977,  p.8).  Several   definitions   now   recognize   that\ninterpretation has secondary aims, as  a  means  of  contributing  to  the  protection  of  the  natural\nenvironment through  revealing  the  meanings  of  an  object,  a  culture  or  a  place  or  enriching\nvisitors\u2019 understanding of the place (Knudson, Cable and  Beck,  1995;  Moscardo,  1998;  Tilden,\n1977) while enhancing visitor enjoyment and satisfaction (Moscardo, 1998).  \n     Previous research has revealed that interpretation can help to manage the  negative  impacts  of\ntourism such as on-site environmental damage, changes  to  the  wildlife  behavior,  pollution  and\nvandalism caused by visitors, through providing visitors with information  about  alternative  sites,\nroutes,   or   activities.   Interpretive   programs   can   also   enhance   visitors\u2019   understanding   of\nconservation issues and develop a positive environmental attitude. In turn, interpretation  can  help\npeople to modify their behavior (Kuo, 2002; Moscardo, 1998\/1999; Marion and Reid, 2007).\n     In order to maximise the benefits of interpretation, Knudson et al. (1995)  emphasized  that  the\nevaluation process should be considered as an integral part of the visitor management process as it\nprovides useful feedback on  whether  desired  management  goals  are  being  met.  However,  the\neffectiveness of interpretation on visitor attitudes and behavior change is not yet  fully  understood\n(Kuo,  2002;  Newsome  et  al.,  2002).  Previous  evaluation  research  has  produced  inconsistent\nfindings (Beaumont,  1999\/2001;  Orams,  1997;  Roggenbuck,  1992).  Reasons  for  these  mixed\nresults include the relative impacts of a number of  correlating  factors   (i.e.  previous  knowledge\nand attitudes), the effect of situational factors as well as the influence of the interpretive  programs\nthemselves and the individual\u2019s attributes (Beaumont, 2001). In tourism settings,  it  is  noted  that\nthe negative impacts of the visitor on the natural environment occur over time rather  than  on  one\nvisit to the site. Thus, it is difficult to measure the immediate benefits of  interpretation  provision.\nIt is also acknowledged that the effectiveness of  interpretation  varies  depending  on  the  type  of\nbehavior and the ways in which attitudes and behavior are conceptualized  and  measured  (Ajzen,\n1992; Ballantyne and Packer, 2005;  Beaumont,  2001;  Ham  and  Krumpe,  1996;  Orams,  1997;\nRoggenbuck, 1992).\n     While a number of challenging issues are addressed  in  previous  research,  there  is  scope  for\nfurther work on  understanding  \u2018when\u2019  interpretation  influences  behavioral  change  rather  than\nquestioning \u2018if\u2019 interpretation can make change or not. This involves determining what  should  be\nevaluated and how it should be measured (Knudson et al., 1995; Thom, 1980).\n     The purpose of this study is to explore a multiple assessment approach  to  examining  different\ntypes of behavioral change through the interpretation experience. The study  also  examines  under\nwhat circumstances and how different  visitor  groups  change  particular  attitudes  and  behavior.\nThis  helps  to  establish  why  site-specific  interpretation  fails  to  have  an  influence  in   certain\nsituations. The fieldwork focuses on the effects of the  visitor  center  in  a  case  study  site  in  the\nSouth-West coastal region of the UK.\nLITERATURE REVIEW\nTheoretical basis for effective interpretive strategies\n     Several theories and conceptual models developed in the  fields  of  environmental  psychology\nand tourism provide a basis for  the  development  of  effective  interpretive  strategies.  Petty  and\nCacioppo\u2019s  (1986)  Elaboration  Likelihood  Model  (ELM)  which  has  two   distinct   routes   to\npersuasion (i.e. \u2018the central route to persuasion\u2019 and \u2018the peripheral route to persuasion\u2019)  provides\na useful understanding of the complex relationships among various  factors  that  lead  to  different\noutcomes of interpretive programs (e.g. persistent behavior change, short-term behavior change or\nno change). Specifically,  it  goes  some  way  to  explain  why  interpretation  sometimes  fails  to\ninfluence attitudes and behavior (Roggenbuck, 1992). This theoretical approach  is  used  to  guide\nthe selection of the main variables to be considered for this current study. \n     The interpretive strategy based on the peripheral route to persuasion involves  modifying  overt\nbehavioral  change  at  least  in  the  short  term  (Manning,  2003).  This  approach   occurs   when\nrecipients are either unmotivated or incapable of processing the logical argument  in  the  message\n(Petty, McMichael, and Brannon, 1992). Thus, the source factors  (e.g.  credibility,  attractiveness,\nand personal style), incentives (e.g. punishment or rewards), language  and  style  of  message  are\nimportant to attract and maintain the passive\/non-captive audience\u2019s attention (Manning, 2003). In\nthis regard, this approach may be acceptable when the focus of management goals is on prompting\nspontaneous behavior and reducing or solving specific problems only temporarily, because it  fails\nto consider issue-relevant reasons for behavior (Manning, 2003; Roggenbuck, 1992).\n      The  strategy  based  on  the  central  route  to  persuasion  focuses  on  underlying   behavioral\nvariables such as knowledge or beliefs, attitudes, and behavioral intentions  (Petty  and  Cacioppo,\n1986).  In  contrast  to  the  peripheral  route,  this  central  route  to  persuasion  occurs  when   the\nindividual is motivated and capable of  processing  the  issue-relevant  arguments  in  the  message\nthrough careful thought or the elaboration and integration of  the  message.  Such  elaboration  and\nintegration results in the creation of new beliefs or changes in old beliefs, and this in turn leads  to\ndesired changes in behavior (Petty et al., 1992;  Roggenbuck,  1992).  This  approach  reflects  the\ntraditional perspective of the knowledge-attitude-behavior link, and attitude-related  theories  (e.g.\nthe theories of reasoned action and planned behavior)  developed  by  Ajzen  and  Fishbein  (1980)\nand Ajzen (1991) which address different types of beliefs shaping voluntary  behavior.  The  many\ncharacteristics of the message content, of the channel of communication, and of  the  situation  can\nbe also determinants  of  the  success  of  persuasion  via  the  central  route.  The  central  route  to\npersuasion is likely to be the  preferred  strategy  to  produce  enduring  changes  in  attitudes  with\nbehavioral consequences and a sensitive and low-impact ethic among  park  visitors  (Petty  et  al.,\n1992).\n     The Elaboration  Likelihood  Model  (ELM)  recognizes  that  recipient  characteristics  have  a\npowerful influence over the relative  success  of  the  various  routes  to  persuasion  (Roggenbuck,\n1992). That is, although visitors receive persuasive information  in  tourism  settings,  information\nwill not have a positive impact on all types of behavior of all ranges of  visitors.  These  individual\nattributes (e.g. visitors\u2019 interest, existing  attitudes,  prior  knowledge  and  past  experiences)  will\nmediate different outcomes (Ajzen, 1992; Roggenbuck, 1992). It is suggested that  attention  must\nbe paid to the  important  role  of  individual  differences  and  message  effectiveness  in  different\nsituations in order to  develop  and  design  effective  influences  of  interpretation  on  the  desired\noutcomes.\nThe evaluation of interpretation effectiveness on environmental behavior\n     The management goals of interpretation in the context of natural areas focus on change to  low-\nimpact behavior and ultimately long-term conservation behavior. Previous  research  has  revealed\nthat the effectiveness of persuasive interpretation varies according  to  the  type  of  environmental\nbehavior (Manning, 2003; Marion and Reid, 2007; Roggenbuck 1992).\n     For example, problem or unintentional behavior and uninformed actions  (e.g.  off-trail  hiking,\npicnic table carving, wildlife feeding and littering)  may  be  considerably  altered  by  information\nand interpretive programs. Several researchers have shown  successful  impact  on  such  behavior\n(Littlefair, 2003; Oliver, Roggenbuck and Watson, 1985; Orams and Hill, 1998; Orams, 1997;  for\nfurther review, see Marion and  Reid,  2007).  Roggenbuck  and  Passineau  (1986)  evaluated  the\neffectiveness of interpreter-guided field  trips  at  the  Indiana  Dunes  National  Lakeshore,  USA.\nThey found that anti-littering messages and role modeling  by  the  interpreter  affected  children\u2019s\nlittering behavior through changing their attitudes toward protection and  conservation  as  well  as\nchanging  their  behavioral  intentions.  A  study  of  visitors  to  Mon  Repos  Conservation   Park,\nAustralia by  Howard  (2000)  had  similar  results.  Here,  interpretation  promoted  visitor\u2019s  self-\nreported behavior through  influencing  increased  knowledge  regarding  turtle  conservation  and,\nultimately, influenced their actual behavior in the six months since their visit.\n     By contrast, other researchers have  pointed  to  the  difficulties  of  influencing  illegal  actions\n(violations  of  the  site   rules   or   regulations)   or   long-term   conservation   behavior   through\ninterpretation (Beaumont, 2001; Manning, 2003; Orams, 1997; Roggenbuck, 1992). For  example,\na few empirical studies (e.g. Dresner and Gill, 1994; Orams, 1997)  found  that  interpretation  had\nsignificant impacts on environmental behavior (e.g. buying ecologically friendly products, making\na donation to an environmental organization, recycling, using public transport,  etc.)  while  others\nfound there was no impact (Beaumont, 2001).\n     While the influences of interpretation effectiveness can be different  in  terms  of  types  of  and\naspects  of  behavior  and  situations,  much  previous  research  of  measurement  objectives  have\nevaluated  mainly  site-specific  inappropriate  behavior  at  a  certain  site  rather  than   long-term\nconservation behavior generally. Additionally, not much has  been  studied  to  measure  multi-act\nbehavior in terms of both site-specific and general perspectives, even though the management role\nof interpretation involves influencing various  types  of  visitor  behavior  in  a  particular  tourism\nsetting rather than targeting a single type of behavior or  management  issue  (Roggenbuck,  1992;\nWidner and Roggenbuck, 2000).\nThe evaluation of interpretation effectiveness on environmental attitudes\n     Attitude is regarded as one of the strong determinants affecting  behavior  and  the  basis  for  a\nbeneficial  outcome  of  interpretation  experiences  (Ballantyne   and   Packer,   2005).   However,\ndefinitions  and  measurements  of  environmental  attitudes  are  problematic.   They   have   been\nconceptualized in various ways and they are expressed in different terms (i.e. \u2018concerns\u2019, \u2018values\u2019,\nand \u2018worldview\u2019) apart from  \u2018attitudes\u2019.  Indeed,  these  have  been  used  interchangeably  in  the\nliterature (Schultz et al., 2004). Schultz et al. (2004) define the  term  \u2018environmental  concern\u2019  as\nthe affect  (i.e.  worry)  associated  with  beliefs  about  environmental  problems.  \u2018Environmental\nattitude\u2019 is defined as \u2018the collection of beliefs, affect, and  behavioral  intentions  a  person  holds\nregarding environmentally related activities  or  issues\u2019  (Schultz  et  al.,  2004,  p.31).  The  major\ndistinct conceptualizations of \u2018environmental concern\u2019 or \u2018environmental attitudes\u2019 seem to  range\nfrom   a   broad   general   attitude   toward   the   environment   to   a   specific    attitude    toward\nenvironmentally related actions or issues (Fransson and G\u00e4rling, 1999).\n     On this point, in the  context  of  tourism  research,  various  scales  and  statements  have  been\nemployed to measure the conceptualization of environmental attitudes. Some have not been tested\nfor reliability, validity and internal consistency (Beaumont, 1999). Many of recent studies using  a\nsample of visitors to nature-based tourism destinations have examined site-specific environmental\nissues based on multidimensional aspects of attitudes  (e.g.  Littlefair,  2003;  Madin  and  Fenton,\n2004; Orams, 1997; Tubb, 2003). Some studies have used the  theory  of  reasoned  action  (TRA)\nproposed by Ajzen and Fishbein (1980) in measuring specific  environmental  attitudes  towards  a\nparticular behavior (e.g. Aipanjiguly, Jacobson, and  Flamm,  2003;  Bright  et  al.,  1993;  Brown,\n1999; Chandool, 1997).\n     The results of these empirical  studies  based  on  different  theories  and  target  variables  have\nproduced inconsistent  findings.  Some  studies  have  found  that  interpretation  has  a  significant\nimpact on increasing knowledge, and occasionally promoting  favorable  attitudes,  which  in  turn\nhas led to visitors\u2019 willingness to engage in  low-impact  behavior.  This  suggests  a  positive  link\nbetween  knowledge,  beliefs,  attitudes  and  intentions  (Bright   et   al.,   1993;   Howard,   2000;\nRoggenbuck  and  Passineau,  1986).  In  some  cases,   interpretation   researchers   and   resource\nmanagers have evaluated the influence of knowledge-based information in changing behavior  and\nreported its failure (Ham and Krumpe, 1996; Orams,  1996).  Other  researchers  have  found  only\nmodest levels of  effect  on  awareness  and  behavior  and  an  unclear  link  between  knowledge,\nattitude,  intentions,  and  behavior   (Beaumont,   2001;   Espiner,   1999;   Orams,   1997;   Tubb,\n2003). Given the various approaches and settings it is very difficult to compare the  results  of  the\nvarious studies.\n     Empirical evaluation studies of attitudinal variables have produced several  challenging  issues,\nbut provide little practical guidance on what  to  evaluate  and  how  to  implement  evaluations  of\ninterpretive programs  (Madin  and  Fenton,  2004).  To  date,  numerous  attitudinal  studies  have\nidentified the complex relationships between multiple aspects of attitudes and other  psychological\nvariables and the prediction of attitude-intention-behavior  (Kaiser,  W\u00f6lfing,  and  Fuhrer,  1999).\nWhile arguments continue about the best way of measuring the  core  antecedent  variables  which\nare salient to the target behavior, Fransson and G\u00e4rling, (1999) suggest that both narrowly defined\nand more generally defined environmental attitudes need to  be  measured  as  both  are  important\ndeterminants of various types of pro-environmental behavior.\n     This argument, applied  to  an  interpretive  programme  suggests  that  behavioral  change  can\naccordingly be influenced by effective interpretation tailoring to primary beliefs that are important\nto the target  audience  (Ballantyne  and  Hughes,  2006;  Monroe,  2003).  In  this  regard,  several\nresearchers propose an alternative interpretive strategy for the design of effective belief- or feeling-\ntargeted  messages,  drawn  from  attitude-based  theories,  providing  a  guideline  about  the  core\ninfluential attitudinal variables to influence pro-environmental behavior  (Ballantyne  and  Packer,\n2005;  Ballantyne  and  Hughes,  2006;  Ham  and  Krump,  1996;  Orams,  1996).  These  include\npersonal knowledge of action strategies and issues, beliefs about  outcomes  of  a  given  behavior,\nfeelings toward a particular  behavior  or  issue,  appreciation  and  concern  for  the  environment,\ndevelopment of intentions to engage in pro-environmental behavior (Ballantyne and Packer, 2005;\nCottrell, 2003; Orams, 1996).\n     To be effective, interpretation managers need to evaluate  the  effects  of  interpretation  on  the\nmultiple measures and examine which  visitors\u2019  beliefs  (or  feelings)  really  influence  how  they\nbehave in a particular situation as  a  result  of  their  interpretive  experience  (Ham  and  Krumpe,\n1996; Ballantyne and Hughes, 2006). But there have been few  empirical  studies  in  this  context.\nThus, the key targeted variables were used to guide the development of the current study.\nRESEARCH OBJECTIVES\n     Considering the limited research outcomes addressed in the  literature,  this  study  examines  a\nmultiple  measurement   approach   to   identify   the   strengths   and   weaknesses   of   site-based\ninterpretation in influencing multi-dimensional aspects of  attitudes  and  behavioral  intentions  in\nrelation to a variety of management issues and practices.\n     As tourism settings attract heterogeneous groups of visitors (e.g. non-captive audiences, adults,\nlocal residents, nature-based tourists, family-oriented tourists), selected key visitor  characteristics\ndrawn from the key components of the ELM theory were  incorporated  into  the  current  research\ndesign in order  to  understand  the  different  levels  of  interpretation  effectiveness  according  to\nvisitors\u2019 interest and involvement in interpretation.\n      By  identifying  specific  subgroups  of  visitors,  the  aim  is   to   enhance   understanding   of\nindividuals\u2019 different interpretive experiences. In doing so  it  is  hoped  that  the  findings  of  this\nstudy will allow managers to develop and design more focused  interpretation  strategies  to  target\neach group\u2019s beliefs, needs and interests, while providing appropriate educational opportunities  to\nmodify their attitudes and behavior.\nSTUDY SITE\nLulworth coastal area\n     The Lulworth coastal area is located in the south-west of England, in the county of Dorset. The\nunique environment of Lulworth Coast contains  several  tourism  attractions  including  Lulworth\nCove, Durdle Door and  Fossil  Forest,  as  well  as  wildlife,  human  activities  and  archeological\nheritage. In particular, Lulworth Cove itself is a beautiful shell-shaped cove which was formed  by\ncoastal erosion (The Lulworth Estate, 2002).\n     Given its  international  reputation  for  stunning  coastal  scenery  and  geology,  the  Lulworth\ncoastal area has long been popular for both domestic and international visitors  attracting  annually\nover  half  a  million  visitors,  particularly  concentrated  during  the  summer  (Dorset   For   You\nPartnership, 2005; The Lulworth Estate, 2002). While the  economic  benefits  of  tourism  to  this\narea are significant, the increasing tourism pressure brings management concerns,  particularly,  in\nrelation to the erosion of footpaths and coastlines and the domination of the  car  park  in  the  area\nsurrounding Lulworth Cove (The Lulworth Estate, 2002).\n     In order  to  achieve  a  balance  between  environmental,  economic  and  social  sustainability,\nseveral management policies have been set up by the Lulworth Estate, which has owned  much  of\nLulworth since 1641 (The Lulworth Estate, 2002). For example, while increasing public access  to\nthe coast is the main management objective, visitors are encouraged to use footpaths and  steps  to\naccess several attractions (e.g. cliff-tops, beaches and  the  Fossil  Forest)  in  order  to  reduce  the\nsevere cliff erosion and to ensure  walkers\u2019  safety.  Some  visitor  activities  have  been  restricted\nincluding climbing the  cliffs  fossil  collecting  and  limited  beach  access.  Climbing  the  coastal\ncliffs, which means roped activities, or hammering the cliff face are particular problems due to the\ndamage to the chalk, the disturbance to wildlife and frequent rock falls.  The  natural  cliff  erosion\nuncovers  a  huge  number  of  fossils,  particularly,  at  the  middle   of   the   cliff.   However,   as\nprofessional and semi-professional climbers visit Lulworth to  collect  fossils  from  the  chalk  for\nscientific research, they tend  to  encourage  visitors  without  experience  or  equipment  to  climb\ndangerous and unstable coastal cliff formations (The Lulworth Estate, 2002).  It  is  recommended\nthat visitors only collect fossils from beach. The  Lulworth  Estate  encourages  visitors  to  take  a\nsmall hammer and hard hats when collecting fossils from the foreshore because  of  frequent  rock\nfalls (UK Fossils Network, 2005; The Lulworth Estate, 2002).\n     In terms of  the  practical  application  of  these  policies  to  the  visitor  management  strategy,\ninterpretation has been employed as one of the main visitor management tools  by  Dorset  County\nCouncil at this site  (Johnson,  2002).  The  interpretive  media  include  signs,  brochures,  guides,\npublications, an internet website, and the Heritage Center. Brochures and signs  contain  a  Visitor\nCode for their own safety and for conservation, setting  out  appropriate  responsible  behavior  for\nfossil collection and walking on  the  beach.  The  Lulworth  Cove  Heritage  Center  serves  many\ndifferent functions, including marketing and access, enhancement  and  information,  management\nand  substitution  for  the  attractions  themselves  (Moscardo,  1998\/1999).  This  is  one   of   five\nCoastlink visitor centers on the Dorset Coast that was developed  by  voluntary  groups  and  local\nstakeholders in order to raise awareness of  the  relatively  unknown  and  unexplored  marine  and\ngeological environment (Dorset Coastlink, 2010a). The centre  provides  exhibitions  and  displays\nshowing the geological features, rocks, fossils, coastal erosion process and  wildlife  as  well  as  a\nvideo of the sea showing the impacts of a winter storm on the  natural  erosion  of  the  coast  (The\nLulworth Estate, 2002). The Lulworth Cove Heritage Center is open daily with free admission and\nprovides various publications (books, leaflets, brochures, and maps) and tourism facilities such  as\na souvenir shop, toilets, restaurants and car parks. Educational tours for school  children,  students\nand the public are also available. \nMETHOD \nSurvey\n     A  self-administered  questionnaire  was  created  to  evaluate  the  effects  of  interpretation  on\nvisitors\u2019 attitudes and behavioral intentions. The survey was  undertaken  at  Lulworth  Cove  over\nfive days in July 2005 including both weekdays  and  weekends.  Five  trained  research  assistants\napproached visitors in beach areas and at the entrance to  Lulworth  Cove  Heritage  Center.  Non-\nEnglish speaking visitors and those under 18 years of age  were  excluded.  In  line  with  previous\ndata about visitors to Dorset during the period May to  September  the  current  research  indicated\nthat the majority of visitors were independent domestic tourists. They were mainly in the 35 to  64\nage groups with noticeably fewer visitors aged between 18 and 24  (Dorset  For  You  Partnership,\n2005).\n      Given  the  exploratory  nature  of  the  study,  the  respondents   were   selected   based   on   a\nconvenience sampling method. They  were  provided  with  a  brief  introduction  and  explanation\nabout  the  purpose  of  the  study  before  being  asked   for   their   agreement   to   proceed.   The\nquestionnaire  took  approximately  15  to  20  minutes  to   complete.   A   total   of   421   useable\nquestionnaires were received out of 575. Of these 216 respondents had not yet been to  the  Visitor\nCenter on that visit, while 205 had already been to the Center.\nMeasurement of variables\n     The questionnaire consisted of a series of questions regarding demographic characteristics, trip\nmotivations for visiting the study site, experiences of the Visitor Centre, and use  of  interpretation\nprograms. Respondents were also asked to answer questions dealing with 31 attitudinal items  and\n13 behavioral items  in  relation  to  local  management  issues  and  environmental  behavior  (see\nTables 1 and 2). Site-specific issues and types  of  low  impact  behavior  were  identified  using  a\nvariety of qualitative techniques. These included analysis  of  publications  and  other  interpretive\nprograms available in this case study  site  as  well  as  informal  exploratory  interviews  with  the\nmanager of the Visitor Center. Ultimately the survey focused on three local  environmental  issues\n(i.e. protection of cliffs, fossils and the coast) and  responsible  behavior  associated  with  each  of\nthese.\nAttitude measurement\n     An attitude measure was developed from a combination of existing statements  (Aipanjiguly  et\nal., 2003; Brown, 1999; Lee and Balchin, 1995; Tubb, 2003)  and  the  multidimensional  concepts\nof environmental attitude constructs identified by previous researchers (Ajzen and Fishbein, 1980;\nBallantyne and Packer, 2005; Orams, 1996).  The  measure  was  made  up  of  sub-dimensions  as\nfollows: (i) the importance of protection of the three local environmental issues (i.e.  protection  of\ncliffs, fossils and the coast) and responsible behavior; (ii)  awareness  of  the  negative  or  positive\nconsequences of each type of behavior (i.e. climbing, collecting fossils from the cliffs and picking\nup beach litter); (iii) visitor support for the management policies regarding each type of  behavior;\nand (iv) feelings of concern about the three local  environmental  issues  or  types  of  behavior.  In\ntotal it consisted of 31 attitudinal items measured on Likert type  scales,  including  22  belief-type\nstatements (ranging  from  1  =  strongly  disagree  to  5  =  strongly  agree)  and  9  emotion-based\nstatements (ranging from 1= not seriously concerned at all to  5=  very  seriously  concerned).  For\nthe measurement of the  emotional  items  a  unipolar  scale  was  employed  instead  of  a  bipolar\nsemantic differential scale as this latter could force respondents to make \u2018a  choice  of  favorability\nor unfavorability\u2019 (Bagozzi, G\u00fcrhan-Canli and Priester, 2002,  p.94).  The  unipolar  scale  can  be\nuseful in representing the intensity of respondents\u2019 different emotional  reactions  (Bagozzi  et  al.,\n2002).\n     Some minor changes to the items were made following several pilot studies  prior  to  the  main\nsurvey. In particular, selecting various types of salient belief and feeling  components  of  attitudes\nwas a difficult task because of site-specific issues and the lack of  methodological  background  or\nprevious empirical research at this case study site. The pilot survey  conducted  at  Lulworth  Cove\nin June 2005 indicated a low  level  of  internal  consistency  reliability  for  the  attitude  measure,\nalthough it was acceptable in an exploratory study with a Cronbach alpha of at  least  over  0.6.  In\norder to improve the reliability, acceptable survey techniques were used by expressing some belief-\ntype statements negatively in order to  minimize  response  bias  (Oppenheim,  1996)  or  dropping\nsome items. The following pilot survey conducted at the  beginning  of  July,  2005  and  the  main\nsurvey showed a much higher internal consistency (all  31  attitude  statements)  with  a  Cronbach\nAlpha of 0.888.\nBehavioral intention measurement \n      The  extent  of  visitors\u2019  commitment  to  participate  in  specific  and  general  activities   was\nmeasured using a 5-point Likert scale  (1=  strongly  disagree  to  5=strongly  agree).  Multiple-act\ncriteria for responsible environmental behavior  were  employed  and  developed  from  statements\nused in previous studies (Beaumont, 2001; Monroe, 2003; Orams,  1997).  These  consisted  of  13\nitems that are derived from three sub-dimensions as follows: (i) site-specific responsible behavior;\n(ii) general responsible behavior; (iii)  environmental  activism  behavior.  The  results  of  several\npilot studies and  the  main  survey  showed  a  high  level  of  reliability  on  this  measure  with  a\nCronbach Alpha of 0.847. For this reason negatively expressed  statements  were  not  included  in\nthe behavioral intention scale.\n     A factor analysis with Varimax rotation was performed to assess the construct  validity  and  to\nexplore the underlying sub-dimensions of each of two indicators. The results of the factor analyses\nof all scales were acceptable (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy  was  over  .80).\nEnvironmental  attitudes  yielded  eight  factors  that  corresponded  with   the   three   site-specific\nconservation topics  and  theoretically  defined  specific  attitude  concepts  (i.e.  belief  or  feeling\ncomponents for each of the conservation topics).  For  a  multi-set  of  responsible  behaviors,  two\nfactors  were  identified  reflecting  specific   responsible   behavior   and   general   environmental\nactivism. \nDATA ANALYSIS\n      To  examine  the  effect  of  interpretation  on  visitors\u2019  attitudes  and   behavioral   intentions,\nrespondents were categorized on the basis of their reported experience of the Visitor Center. Table\n3 shows how the sample is distributed according to  the  two  main  criteria  which  were   visitors\u2019\nintention to visit  the  Center  and  their  previous  experience  of  the  Center,  as  reviewed  in  the\npersuasion theory (ELM). Three main questions were used for categorizing subgroups of  visitors:\n(1) present experience of the Center (2) intention to visit the Center and (3) past experience of  the\nCenter. About one half (n=205) of  all  respondents  (n=421)  indicated  that  they  had  visited  the\nCenter on this occasion. Of those who had not visited the Center on this occasion (n=216) only 58\n(27.1%) indicated that they planned to visit. As for previous experience of the Center, 161 (38.6%\nof valid responses) had visited before.  \n     Based on these questions, the total sample was initially divided into four sub-groups (1)  \u2018those\nwho had not visited the Center before and had no intention of doing so\u2019,  (2)  \u2018those  who  had  not\nvisited the Center before but planned to visit on this occasion\u2019, (3) \u2018those who had not  visited  the\nCenter yet on this occasion but had previous experience\u2019, (4) \u2018those  who  had  visited  the  Center\nthis occasion\u2019. A series of ANOVA tests showed that there were significant differences  in  visitor\nattitudes and behavioral intentions scores between the four sub-groups. However, further  analysis\n(the post hoc test-Tukey method) revealed no statistical differences in the two dependent variables\n(i.e. attitudes and behavioral intention scores) between (3) \u2018those who  had  not  visited  today  but\nhad previous experience of the Center\u2019 and (4) \u2018those who had visited the Center this time\u2019. Hence\nthese two groups were combined. For the final analysis, three sub-groups  were  formed:  Group  I\n(\u2018non-visitors\u2019): \u2018those who had not visited the Center at all  and  had  no  intention  of  doing  so\u2019;\nGroup II (\u2018interested visitors\u2019): \u2018those who planned to visit the Center but had not visited  before\u2019;\nGroup  III  (\u2018experienced  visitors\u2019):  \u2018those  who  had  visited  the  Center  before  and\/or  on   this\noccasion\u2019. These three sub-groups were used to  determine  the  effects  of  the  Visitor  Center  on\nvisitors\u2019 attitudes and behavioral intentions in further analysis.\n     The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences Version 12.0 for Windows was used to  analyze\nthe data. A series of Chi-Square and ANOVA tests were conducted to compare the  differences  in\nseveral indicators among the three sub-groups.\nRESULTS\nVisitor profiles\n      The  three  sub-groups  had  similar  profiles  and  a  series  of  Chi-square  tests  indicated   no\nsignificant differences for most characteristics. The exceptions related to age, education,  previous\nexperience of natural areas and motivation for the trip. Results are given in  Tables  4  and  5.  The\n\u2018experienced visitors\u2019 (Group III) were older, had more previous experience of  natural  areas  and\nwere more interested in \u201clearning about protection\u201d than the other two groups.  The  \u2018non-visitors\u2019\n(Group I) and \u2018interested visitors\u2019 (Group II) respondents (over 50%) had  a  higher  proportion  of\nuniversity degrees than the \u2018experienced visitors\u2019 (Group III) respondents (38%).\nThe type of interpretation participation  \n     Table 6 shows different levels of visitor participation in the type of  interpretive  programs  that\nthey used at  the  site.  The  Visitor  Center  provided  exhibition\/displays,  computer  interactions,\nfilms, and publications focusing on the coastal and geological  environment  as  well  as  the  local\nhistory. Other types of interpretive programs included signboards, brochures, guided  walks,  talks\nto the  staff,  and  others  (e.g.  maps).  The  results  of  Chi-Square  tests  showed  that  there  were\nsignificant differences among the three sub-groups  in  types  of  interpretation  participation.  The\n\u2018experienced visitors\u2019 were more likely to use a number of different types of interpretive programs\n(e.g. different  types  of  media  within  the  Center  and  elsewhere)  while  the  \u2018non-visitors\u2019  and\n\u2018interested visitors\u2019  typically only used one or two, mainly \u2018signboards\u2019 and \u2018brochures\u2019.\nThe effects of the Visitor Center on attitudes\n     Most respondents\u2019 attitudes  were  strongly  positive  as  regards  the  quality  of  coastal  areas,\nresponsible behavior, fossil protection and cliff protection. In particular, most respondents  agreed\nstrongly that \u2018it is important to protect the quality of the coastal area\u2019, and \u2018beach litter contributes\nto water pollution\u2019. They generally disagreed with the economic benefits of fossil collecting.\n     With regard to comparisons among the three sub groups  (Table  7),  the  results  of  a  one-way\nANOVA test showed that significant differences were found in 19  items  including  beliefs  about\nspecific issues  regarding  \u2018cliff  erosion\u2019  and  \u2018climbing\u2019,  \u2018importance  of  protection\u2019,  \u2018negative\nimpacts of fossil collecting\u2019, and \u2018support for  picking  up  beach  litter\u2019.  Overall,  those  who  had\nexperienced the Visitor Center appeared to have a significantly and  positively  enhanced  level  of\nbeliefs and concerns about \u2018cliff erosion\u2019 and \u2018climbing the cliffs\u2019, followed by \u2018negative  impacts\nof fossil collecting\u2019. However, no significant differences  were  apparent  in  beliefs  and  concerns\nabout \u2018negative impacts of beach  litter\u2019  or  about  \u2018positive  outcomes  of  fossil  collecting\u2019  (e.g.\n\u2018helping science research\u2019 and \u2018economic value of fossil  collecting\u2019).  The  \u2018experienced  visitors\u2019\nhad a higher score on these conservation issues than the other two groups.\n     More detailed, post-hoc tests (Tukey and Scheffe  methods)  demonstrated  that  no  significant\ndifferences were found between the \u2018non-visitors\u2019 (Group I) and  \u2018interested  visitors\u2019  (Group  II).\nHowever, comparison between Group I and III, indicates that the \u2018non-visitors\u2019  had  less  positive\nattitudes about \u2018cliff erosion\u2019  and  \u2018fossil  protection\u2019  and  were  significantly  different  from  the\n\u2018experienced visitors\u2019. In comparison between the \u2018interested visitors\u2019 and  \u2018experienced  visitors\u2019,\nsignificant differences between the two groups were found in their beliefs that \u2018it  is  dangerous  to\nclimb the cliffs\u2019 and \u2018collect fossils from the cliffs\u2019, and  concern  about  \u2018people  not  keeping  the\nfootpaths on the cliffs\u2019. \nThe effects of the Visitor Center on behavioral intentions\n     Most visitors had a high  level  of  positive  intention  toward  general  environmental  behavior\nwhile  they  had  a  lower  level  of  intentions  toward  \u2018donation\u2019,  becoming  \u2018a  member   of   an\nenvironmental organization\u2019, and \u2018volunteer work\u2019. In addition, respondents\u2019 intentions  were  less\nfavorable  on  \u2018removing  beach  litter\u2019  \u2018telling  people  about  the  importance  of  the   geological\nenvironment in this area\u2019 and \u2018involvement in environmental issues\u2019.\n     Table 8 sets out the significant findings about the commitment of respondents to changing their\nbehavior in comparisons among  the  three  subgroups.  The  results  of  a  one-way  ANOVA  test\nshowed that there were differences among the three groups in 6 environmental behavior items (i.e.\n\u2018not collecting fossils\u2019, \u2018informing about the discovery of  special  fossils\u2019,  \u2018not  climbing  on  the\ncliffs\u2019, \u2018keeping to the footpaths\u2019, \u2018behaving in a way that will not harm plants  and  animals\u2019,  and\n\u2018becoming involved in environmental issues\u2019). There were no  significant  differences  among  the\nthree groups in relation to environmental activism and other general environmental behavior.\n     The post-hoc tests (Tukey and Scheffe methods) indicated that the \u2018experienced visitors\u2019 had  a\nhigher mean score in all these 6 items  in  which  there  were  significant  differences  between  the\n\u2018non-visitors\u2019  and  \u2018experienced  visitors\u2019.   The   comparison   between   the   \u2018non-visitors\u2019   and\n\u2018interested  visitors\u2019  showed  significant  differences  in  one  item,  \u2018not  collecting   the   fossils\u2019.\nSignificant differences between the \u2018interested visitors\u2019 and \u2018experienced visitors\u2019 also  existed  in\nrelation to \u2018informing about the discovery of fossils\u2019 with the \u2018experienced visitors\u2019 more likely to\nact positively.\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n     This study reports on an attempt to examine the strengths and weaknesses of interpretation as a\nvisitor management tool in promoting different types of environmental attitudes and behavior with\nregard to  multiple  site-specific  management  issues.  In  doing  so  it  seeks  to  suggest  that  this\napproach is more effective than determining its influence on limited target variables in  relation  to\na particular topic or a single type of behavior (Ballantyne and Hughes, 2006; Maddin and  Fenton,\n2004; Ham and Krumpe, 1996; Lee and Balchin, 1995).  \n     It contributes to an understanding of how different sub-groups behave and the measurement  of\nattitudes and behavioral intentions in specific and  general  contexts.  The  key  findings  echo  the\nevidence of previous literature which indicates that interpretation efforts partly succeed in altering\nvisitor behavior but its impacts are limited to site-specific issues. It was evident  that  most  effects\nwere  found  in  relation  to  specific   attitudes   and   behavioral   intentions   towards   two   local\nenvironmental issues, \u2018cliff  protection\u2019  and  \u2018fossil  protection\u2019.  However,  it  had  less  effect  in\nrelation to  general  attitudes  towards  environmental  protection  or  to  more  general  behavioral\nintentions  such  as  removing  beach  litter  or  involvement  in  environmental  activism.  This   is\nconsistent with the findings of Tubb  (2003),  that  within  the  High  Moorland  Visitor  Center  at\nDartmoor National Park, UK, the Center was effective only  in  changing  attitudes  related  to  the\nfeeding of wildlife, but that no effects on general attitudes toward  the  natural  environment  were\nseen.\n     The multiple measurements of environmental attitudes and behavior provide  valuable  insights\ninto an improved understanding of \u2018when\u2019 interpretation is effective in influencing different  types\nof attitudes and behavior. Results highlight  that  visitors  who  had  been  exposed  to  the  Visitor\nCenter had a higher level of awareness of, concern about,  and  support  for  management  policies\ntoward the negative outcomes of the specific problem behavior compared  to  those  who  had  not\nbeen to the Center. This key finding is  consistent  with  the  TRA\u2019s  (Ajzen  and  Fishbein,  1980)\nproposition, that increasing specific beliefs about a particular behavior is strongly associated  with\nspecific attitudes  and  behavioral  intentions  towards  given  types  of  behavior.  Supporting  this\nnotion, in the case of Lulworth Cove, it was evident that visitor management policy has resulted in\na significant downturn in the number of climbing related accidents (e.g. using  ropes  or  hammers\nto collect fossils from the cliff) (The Lulworth Estate, 2002) as the interpretive media  (e.g.  films,\nexhibits, brochures, website, and signboards) emphasizes the  unstable  coastal  environment  (e.g.\nnatural cliff erosion) and behavioral concerns for visitor safety. \n     This supports the  premise  that  influencing  actions  require  specific  belief-based  or  feeling-\nbased information about the consequences of the  actions,  the  associated  consequences,  and  the\nbasic human emotions  of  fear,  anxiety  and  pity,  when  management  issues  are  targeting  site-\nspecific responsible behavior (Ballantyne and Packer, 2005; Monroe, 2003; Roggenbuck 1992).\n     The study also helps  to  identify  the  weaknesses  of  the  current  interpretation  in  promoting\ncertain types of long-term conservation behavior, consistent with the findings of previous research\n(Beaumont, 2001). Limitations in  its  effects  on  long-term  conservation  behavior  (e.g.  \u2018giving\ndonations\u2019, \u2018volunteer work\u2019, and \u2018membership of environmental organization\u2019) or  responsibility-\ndenial behavior (i.e. \u2018removing beach litter\u2019) suggest that different strategies should be  considered\nfor these.\n     This finding indicates that the current interpretive messages targeting general attitudes  may  be\npoor determinants of these types of behavior. For example, the focus of  the  Center  is  on  raising\nvisitors\u2019  awareness  about  the  coastal  and  geological   environment   and   protection   of   these\nresources. Other types of interpretive programs (e.g. brochures) contain  only  factual  information\nhighlighting the Visitor Code such as \u201ckeep the shore tidy\u201d and \u201ctake your litter home\u201d that visitor\nshould change but  with  limited  explanations  about  the  consequences  of  beach  litter  in  detail\n(Dorset Coastlink, 2010b). Thus, managers need to go one step further and evaluate the  effects  of\ndifferent interpretive strategies (e.g. conveying specific responsibility-targeted messages, the  ease\nwith which the action can be done, or reducing barriers to the particular behavior)  (Adams,  2003;\nMonroe,  2003;  Roggenbuck,  1992)  which  are  stronger  determinants  of  general  conservation\nbehavior in order  to  improve  the  effects  of  the  current  interpretive  program  (Ballantyne  and\nPacker, 2005; Cottrell, 2003; Orams, 1996).\n     Other factors might be considered to explain why site-specific  interpretation  fails  to  have  an\ninfluence on general environmental attitudes. This might be related to a \u2018ceiling effect\u2019  or  \u2018social\ndesirability\u2019  (Chawla,  1999).   This   study   confirms   arguments   by   previous   researchers   in\nidentifying  that  both  visitors  to  nature-based  activities  and  the  wider  public  have   generally\nenvironmentally favorable attitudes and they do  not  change  significantly  through  interpretation\ndue to a \u2018ceiling effect\u2019 (Asfeldt, 1992; Beaumont 2001; Orams 1997).  Thus,  the  previous  well-\ndefined attitudes appear to mediate the outcome of  interpretation.  As  Orams  (1997)  argues,  the\npossible reason for the  findings  might  also  be  the  influence  of  \u2018social  desirability\u2019.  As  most\nvisitors are aware of conservation issues and environmentally responsible  behavior,  visitors  may\nhave simply responded in a  manner  that  is  consistent  with  well-known  and  socially  accepted\nviews about environmental issues and positions,  and  not  on  the  basis  of  how  they  really  feel\n(Ewert and Baker, 2001; Orams, 1997). As a result some of the attitude  statements  regarding  the\ngeneral environment and responsible behavior used in this study (e.g. \u2018it is  important  for  visitors\nto behave in an environmentally responsible way\u2019, \u2018it is  important  to  protect  the  quality  of  the\ncoastal area\u2019) might need to be modified in further study.\n     Despite the limitations, this study helps interpretive planners or tourism managers to  use  these\nfindings in making a  careful  decision  about  what  approach  works  best  for  different  types  of\nvisitors (high motivation to process the message and high knowledge vs low motivation to process\nthe message and low knowledge). Unlike national parks or  ecotourism-based  settings,  this  study\nsite offers a wide range of tourist activities which attract both sun and sea tourists  with  relaxation\nmotivations  as   well   as   nature-based   tourists.   Accordingly,   interests   and   preferences   for\ninterpretive programs vary.\n     As mentioned in the persuasion theory (ELM) (Pretty and Cacciopo, 1986; Petty et  al.,  1992),\nthe central route to persuasion approach appears to  be  effective  in  modifying  site-specific  low-\nimpact behavior for the \u2018experienced visitors\u2019 (Group III) who were older, had high interest in  the\nnatural environment, and a desire to learn about the site-specific issues while visiting the  site.  On\nthe other hand, this  study  suggests  that  special  attention  should  be  paid  to  the  \u2018non-visitors\u2019\n(Group I) who were younger, had lower levels of environmental awareness, and lack of interest  in\non-site interpretive messages. Younger people might only be interested in  visiting  the  beach  for\nswimming  or  sunbathing  (perhaps  with  children)  or  they  might  be  more   interested   in   the\nchallenges presented by the cliffs and fossil collection. Thus,  the  peripheral  route  to  persuasion\napproach is necessary to target immediate on-site modification of a  new  attitude  or  spontaneous\nbehavior.\n     In this regard, the results of this study emphasize that different interpretive strategies according\nto the types of behavior need to be applied through tailoring to the preferences and perceptions  of\ntargeted audience groups (Roggenbuck, 1992).\nTHEORETICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS\n     In terms of research design issues,  it  is  clear  that  this  is  one  of  the  challenges  in  tourism\nsettings to develop appropriate research designs given the attempt to evaluate a  single  and  direct\nimpact of interpretation as the use of experimental research designs  requires  adequate  control  of\nall potential confounding variables (Marion and Reid, 2007).  Much  previous  research  has  often\nused the research  design  of  the  pre-visit  and  post-visit  groups  but  there  is  also  considerable\ndifficulty in matching the profiles of the two sub-groups for such comparisons in the  field  setting\n(Lee and Balchin, 1995). In this study, an attempt has been made to overcome these difficulties, in\nrelation to experience of the Visitor Centre, by making  the  groups  sufficiently  large  to  produce\nsubgroups that are equivalent  on  some  significant  relevant  variables  (Lee  and  Balchin,  1995;\nOppenheim, 1996). Thus, considering the active role of visitors in their response and  involvement\nin the interpretive programs  addressed  in  the  persuasion  model  (ELM)  (Pretty  and  Cacciopo,\n1986), these key visitor-related  factors  (i.e.  non-visitors,  visitors\u2019  intention  to  experience,  and\nprevious experience of the Visitor Center) were incorporated into  the  group  comparisons,  hence\narriving at the three subgroups that were used  in  the  analysis.  This  approach  was  found  to  be\neffective in identifying different levels of persuasion effects among the three subgroups.\n     However, it is always difficult to  control  for  all  confounding  factors  which  are  one  of  the\nproblems in determining the direct impact of interpretation. This is  possibly  due  to  uncontrolled\nvariables remaining even  though  the  suspected  confounding  factors  were  matched  across  the\ngroups  (Oppenheim,  1996).  Therefore,  there  will  be  doubt  about   whether   or   not   revealed\ndifferences in attitude or behavioral intention are the result of exposure to interpretive messages in\nthe Visitor Center or the differences  of  visitor  characteristics.  While  it  can  be  argued,  further\nanalysis  needs  to  determine  the  relative  impacts  of  these  individual  factors  on  attitude  and\nbehavior.\n     While the persuasion model is useful in  understanding  the  multiple  effects  of  interpretation,\nthis model has a limitation in providing detailed  guidance  as  to  what  and  how  to  measure  the\nattitude construct. This research supports the premise that each theory has its own  limitations  and\ncannot encompass all factors as the process of human behavior  is  very  complex  and  difficult  to\nchange (Kollmuss and Agyeman, 2002; Widner and Roggenbuck, 2000). Some  researchers  agree\nthat the theory of reasoned action (Ajzen and Fishbein,  1980)  can  be  useful  in  determining  the\nprimary  beliefs  influencing  a  single  and  voluntary  behavior  but  has   limited   application   to\ninvestigate a variety of tourist behaviors (Lee and Balchin, 1995). Widner and Roggenbuck (2000)\nargue that the inconsistent and contradictory findings of the effectiveness  of  interpretation  might\nbe due to the way of examining behavior change research based on  the  particular  theory.  In  this\nsense, this study did not attempt to test a particular theory for the measurement of attitudes. While\napplying one particular theory to the  conceptual  and  operational  measurement  of  attitudes  and\nbehavior could be valuable  to  some  extent,  the  current  study  provides  evidence  that  multiple\nmeasurements drawn from various attitude-related  theoretical  perspectives  can  be  useful  if  the\npurpose of the study is to identify the effects of different levels of persuasion on various aspects of\nbehavior or management issues. As Madin and Fenton (2004) argue, this approach can be  seen  as\nthe effective evaluation method which allows practitioners to gain an insightful  understanding  of\n\u2018how well\u2019 or \u2018how much\u2019 management  objectives  of  interpretation  are  being  achieved  and  to\nestablish what specific actions need to be taken to improve interpretation. \nLIMITATIONS AND FUTURE STUDIES\n     The study has several limitations. The limitations in sampling need  to  be  considered  such  as\nthe sampling approach, the timing of the  data  collection  and  the  locations  selected  which  will\nintroduce selection bias and  a  lack  of  generalizability  of  the  results.  This  study  sampled  day\nvisitors  during  summer,  using   a   non-probability   convenience   sampling   method.   Informal\ninterviews with the Center staff prior to the research indicated that different visitor  groups  visited\nover the year. For example, family groups visited mostly during  summer  vacations  while  young\ncouples visited during the off-season. A survey incorporating a  more  diverse  sample  population\nwould be useful.\n     The  outcomes  of  the  research  may  be  influenced  by  several  factors  including  the  target\naudiences, messages, media channels, processing factors and  situational  factors  as  addressed  in\nthe persuasive communication literature (Hovland et al., 1953). The focus of this study was on the\neffects  of  visitor  participation  in  the  Visitor  Centre  as  a  simple   indicator   to   evaluate   the\nmanagement  objectives  of  interpretation.  Distinctions  of  the  relative   effects   of   interpretive\ncontextual factors were not made, however, due to the limited  scope  of  the  study.  Thus,  further\nstudy on other types of indicators such as the level of engagement, the direct and  relative  impacts\nof the type of media, the quality of programs offered, or the intensity and affective reactions to the\npersuasive message will validate effective techniques that might be useful to  improve  the  design\nof interpretive programs.\n     The on-site interpretation in the case study site addresses the importance  of  protecting  natural\ncliff erosion. Visitors might be confused by the lack of specificity in some attitude statements (e.g.\n\u2018the cliffs are eroding rapidly\u2019, \u2018it is important to keep cliff erosion  to  a  minimum\u2019)  as  they  are\naware that cliff erosion is caused not only by  the  sea  or  the  weather  but  also  by  inappropriate\nvisitor behavior.  Therefore,  future  research  needs  to  explore  their  awareness  of  natural  cliff\nerosion to validate the current research findings.\n     The current study did not  examine  actual  behavioral  change  as  a  result  of  the  interpretive\nexperience. Further study should evaluate the effects of interpretation on conservation behavior on-\nsite through observations and self-reported surveys or at home through  a  later  follow-up  survey.\nThis may help to diminish  the  criticism  in  relation  to  its  ineffectiveness  on  actual  behavioral\nchange in the longer term.\nREFERENCES\nAdams, W.J.
