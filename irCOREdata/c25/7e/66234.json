This article\nconsiders the way in which one such frame of reference\u2014that developed\nby Erving Goffman to represent the variety of human science understand-\nings of the nature of identity in social interaction\u2014distinguished between\n\u201cpersonal,\u201d \u201csocial,\u201d and \u201cself\u201d identity. The relative neglect of the first of\nthese three categorizations is noted. Following Garfinkel\u2019s suggestions for\nthe \u201crespecification\u201d of social analysis, this article suggests the usefulness\nof an approach to the neglected issue of personal identity that suspends\ntheoretical stipulation about an abstract noun in favor of an ethnographic\nstudy of a particular occupational group\u2014forensic investigators\u2014for whom\nan orientation to personal identities is a recurrent accountable practical\nconcern.\nIn his ambitious study of social theory Parsons (1949) argued that the successful de-\nvelopment of disciplinary knowledge is based not simply on the collection of \u201cfacts\u201d\ncapable of testing the validity of specific propositions but also on the essential selec-\ntivity of the theoretical systems and conceptual schemes necessary to shape, direct,\nand limit the range of empirical inquiry. This selectivity distinguishes between what\nis and what is not relevant to the system in question and provides encouragement to\nfurther conceptual development within whatever boundaries practitioners draw\nand police. This selectivity is visible in the repertoire of categories that gives sub-\nstance to the system in question, and the way that categories are represented within\nit marks their level of relevance to its intended disciplinary objectives:\nEvery system, both including its theoretical propositions and its main relevant\nempirical insights, may be visualized as an illuminated spot enveloped by dark-\nness. . . . The point is, what lies outside the spot is not really \u201cseen\u201d until the\n516 Symbolic Interaction Volume 26, Number 4, 2003\nsearchlight moves, and then only what lies within the area into which its beam is\nnewly cast. The logical name for the darkness is, in general, \u201cresidual categories.\u201d\n(Parsons 1949:16\u201317)\nParsons is deliberately vague in his usage of the terms \u201ctheoretical systems\u201d and\n\u201cconceptual schemes,\u201d and even when he promises a more detailed treatment, he\nonly offers what he describes as a \u201cpreliminary, tentative\u201d typology of such\nschemes. However, he makes some useful remarks about the most fundamental of\nthese, which he calls \u201cdescriptive frames of reference.\u201d He describes such descrip-\ntive frames of reference as \u201cmodes of general relations of the facts implicit in the\ndescriptive terms employed\u201d (Parsons 1949:28). For him, they constitute necessary\nschema for selective provision and ordering of empirical facts. They also make pos-\nsible identifications and definitions of the phenomenon to be explained, and guide\nthe evaluation of the significance of any subsequent statements of \u201cexplanatory\nvalue.\u201d\nParsons argues that although such frames of reference vary in their explicitness\nand scope, disciplined inquiry is impossible without using them. The history of so-\nciological theory and research includes many such schemes. Since Parsons sought to\nbuild an exceptionally powerful and explicit frame of reference as his contribution\nto the development of sociological theory (the \u201cschema of action\u201d), he only pro-\nvides examples of those with long-lasting heuristic value, such as the \u201cspatiotemporal\nframework\u201d of classical physics and orthodox \u201csupply and demand\u201d theory in eco-\nnomics. In fact, the history of sociological analysis is largely a record of the intro-\nduction, development, and application of a bewildering variety of such schemes at a\nnumber of theoretical levels, most of which have not been sustained over such long\nperiods or had such powerful effects as those of Parsons.\nBut whatever their longevity, the necessary commitment to the development of\nsuch theoretical schemes requires the willingness of their proponents to accumulate\nconceptual and empirical work guided by the \u201cpositive categories\u201d within them.\nMoreover, this commitment also serves to exclude from interest whatever catego-\nries proponents have assigned to the inevitable residuum that the selectivity of the\nschemes imply. Insofar as residual categories constitute the \u201cdeliberately unexam-\nined\u201d in the construction and use of theoretical frames of reference, it (almost) goes\nwithout saying that a decision to illuminate such twilight areas of scholarly disci-\nplines itself promises heuristic advancement, even while threatening disciplinary\nclosure: \u201cThe process of carving out positive concepts from residual categories is\nalso a process by which the reconstruction of theoretical systems is accomplished as\na result of which they may eventually be altered beyond all recognition\u201d (Parsons\n1949:19).\nIn this article, I illustrate the way theoretical or empirical studies may facilitate\nthe examination of the content and status of such residual categories and, further,\nsuggest that such instances provide interesting possibilities for the development of\nsociological knowledge.\nResidual Categories and Disciplinary Knowledge 517\nIDENTITY: A FRAME OF REFERENCE AND ITS RESIDUUM\nParsons developed his schema as a descriptive frame of reference for all adequate\nanalysis of the structure of social action. However, Goffman constructed an ambi-\ntious, but less explicitly articulated, framework for the analysis of the structure of\nsocial interaction, which he first awkwardly described as \u201cconversational inter-\naction\u201d as a \u201cspecies of social order\u201d (Goffman 1953) and, more elegantly, thirty\nyears later, \u201cthe interaction order\u201d (Goffman 1983). Although no single place in\nGoffman\u2019s corpus of work definitively displays this highly abstract frame of refer-\nence, Manning (1992) has provided an excellent reconstruction of what he identi-\nfied as the \u201cSIAC schema.\u201d The use of this schema allows Goffman to develop con-\nceptual and empirical inquiries attentive to a number of central principles which, he\nargues, constitute the interaction order: \u201csituational propriety,\u201d \u201cinvolvement,\u201d \u201cac-\ncessibility,\u201d and \u201ccivil inattention.\u201d\nHowever, Goffman\u2019s work also contains a large number of other, less encom-\npassing conceptual schemata and frames of reference. Some commentators argue\nthat the accumulation and variability of such schema comprise conceptual profli-\ngacy on his part, yet two central concepts consistently articulated within this frame-\nwork are \u201cself\u201d and \u201cidentity.\u201d These closely related terms demarcate a terrain of\ninterest and suggest ways of more closely examining its contours.1\nIn the course of his study of \u201cspoiled identity,\u201d Goffman (1968) offered a descrip-\ntive frame of reference representing the underlying conceptual orderliness arguably\npresent across a very large range of human sciences studies that claimed to focus on\n\u201cidentity.\u201d The timing of this effort may not be accidental. Gleason (1983) has\npointed out that during the period in which Goffman was writing this book\u2014the\nearly 1960s\u2014a remarkable intensification and reorientation of a long-standing in-\ntellectual interest in the \u201cproblem of identity\u201d occurred. Since their origins in the\nrapidly industrializing societies of western Europe in the nineteenth century, a vari-\nety of sociological understandings of identity matters have been derived from and\nsought to supplement or supplant several prior accounts of the metaphysics of iden-\ntity. The common rationale for these disciplinary developments and innovations ar-\ngued for the recognition of the essential and ineradicably social character of the\nphenomenon of identity. The details of exactly what scholars meant by reference to\nsuch an essential and ineradicable social character varied. Some found it sufficient\nto note the significance of the changing social contexts in which generic psychody-\nnamic processes of identity formation were activated and conditioned. Others em-\nphasized that social structures provided a series of templates or positions with pre-\nspecified roles, values, and identities, thus locating within the collectivity what had\npreviously been treated as the product of the self-interrogation of individuals in the\nconstruction of their own identities. Still others asserted that the essentially social\ncharacter of identity derived from its origins in linguistic convention, dialogue, or\nthe dynamics of interaction.\nGoffman (1968) comments on this range of conventional meanings and uses of\n518 Symbolic Interaction Volume 26, Number 4, 2003\nthe term \u201cidentity\u201d while developing his own conceptual framework. He gives\nstructure to this by adjectival qualifications of the generic term and thus produces a\ntrichotomous classification comprising \u201cpersonal identity,\u201d \u201csocial identity,\u201d and\n\u201cego (or self) identity.\u201d The following paragraphs outline this framework.\nThe term \u201cpersonal identity\u201d refers to that \u201cwhich distinguishes an individual\nfrom all others\u201d (Goffman 1968:74). Goffman notes that in contemporary society,\nthis sense of identity normally corresponds to legal identity. In his discussion of\npersonal identity, he focuses on the variety of ways that each individual may be\nsaid to have a set of unique characteristics. This set of characteristics constitutes\nsuch an identity for them. According to Goffman, two ideas come together in how\nwe think about this. He describes the first as the \u201cpositive mark\u201d or \u201cidentity peg\u201d\nof an individual\u2014the image or trace of this particular person in photographic or\nother material or mental records and representations. The second is the unique place\nthat an individual occupies in a network and history of relationships. In either case,\nthe notion that the representation or place in some network uniquely identifies only\none person defines this view of personal identity. For Goffman (1968:74\u201375), refer-\nence to such personal identity rests on \u201cthe assumption that the individual can be\ndifferentiated from all others and that around this means of differentiation a single\ncontinuous record of social facts can be attached, entangled like candy floss, becom-\ning then the sticky substance to which still other biographical facts can be attached.\u201d\nA second usage, \u201csocial identity,\u201d reflects the availability of \u201cthe means of cate-\ngorizing persons and the complement of attributes felt to be ordinary and natural\nfor members of each of these categories\u201d (Goffman 1968:11). He points out that the\nattributes that compose any category of social identities will likely be complex and\nvaried, because they include a wide range of cognitive, attitudinal, personal, and\nsocial features. Given his interactionist focus, these social identities are largely of\ninterest to the extent that they provide ordinary actors with templates for the orga-\nnization and understanding of one another\u2019s conduct in specific social settings. They\nare both anticipations and \u201crighteously presented demands\u201d deployed when people\ninteract with others. In addition, however, this sense of identity has relevance for\nwider social circumstances: the content of such social identity categories guide what\nis assumed to be true of members of the relevant category as well as what may be\nexpected of them in a variety of social and discursive contexts. People frequently\nspeak and write of a \u201ccommon identity,\u201d of a kind of sameness between some \u201ckinds\u201d\nof people. Although references to this commonality may seem to contradict the no-\ntion that identity needs to carry some sense of uniqueness or fundamental differ-\nence from others, such a seeming contradiction does not appear to invalidate either\nor both of these standard uses. Certainly, an interest in the continuity of identity\nacross persons rather than across time and place for one person has led to recent\nconcerns with the \u201cpolitics of identity.\u201d Ever since Marx\u2019s discussion of \u201cclasses-for-\nthemselves,\u201d serious problems have arisen about assertions concerning the signifi-\ncance of \u201ccollective actors,\u201d whether the collectivity is defined in a single identity\ncategory (e.g., African Americans, women, English) or in an ever more complex\nResidual Categories and Disciplinary Knowledge 519\ncombination of such categories. Yet however much the notion of such collective\nactors might have been seen as problematic in the human sciences, contemporary\npolitical rhetoric often explicitly or implicitly draws on the rhetorical capacity of\nsuch an idea to mobilize and shape the affiliations of individuals and groups.\nWe may think of personal identity as referring to what differentiates each indi-\nvidual person from all others and social identity as referring to those\u2014particularly\ncultural\u2014attributes that individuals share by virtue of common membership in a\nsocial category. We can distinguish both of these from a third sense of identity that\nGoffman argues may be found in lay and professional accounts of individuals and\ntheir conduct. He calls this third usage \u201cego identity\u201d or \u201cself-identity\u201d (and some-\ntimes \u201cfelt\u201d identity), and he defines it as \u201cthe subjective sense of his own situation\nand his continuity and character that an individual comes to obtain as a result of his\nvarious social experiences\u201d (Goffman 1968:129). We can distinguish the meaning of\nsuch ego or self-identity from that of personal identity (which is also concerned\nwith unique singularity) by its character as a subjective accomplishment. In Burns\u2019s\n(1992) phrase, self-identity is \u201cfelt\u201d rather than ascribed or ascribable. Self-identity,\nthen, refers to what most of us think about when we think of the deepest and most\nenduring features of our unique selves as what we \u201creally are.\u201d No necessary dif-\nference arises between the content of the avowed and ascribed attributes drawn on\nin the constitution of self-identities, on the one hand, and personal and social iden-\ntities, on the other. The difference, Goffman (1968:130) argues, is that with self-\nidentity, the individual \u201cexercises important liberties in regard to what he fashions.\u201d\nMost important here seems to be the capacity of individuals to choose among a set\nof available attributes and a concern with the coherence and consistency discernible\nwithin the variety of characterizations accepted to be true of oneself independent of\ntime and location.\nThis trichotomous classification seems to capture the wide\u2014and rapidly\nexpanding\u2014range of existing studies of identity with reasonable exactitude. It\nmarks both commonalities and differences between and within structuralist and\ninteractionist approaches to this topic. This fact, however, makes more remarkable\nthe speed with which scholars reduced the trichotomy to a dichotomy, first in\nGoffman\u2019s work and later in almost all borrowings and commentaries. They re-\nduced it either by collapsing two of the terms into one or by simply neglecting one\nof the three. Goffman effected the first kind of reduction when he bracketed social\nand personal identity together and then contrasted them to ego or self-identity:\nSocial and personal identity are part, first of all, of other persons\u2019 concerns and\ndefinitions regarding the individual whose identity is in question. . . . On the\nother hand, ego identity is first of all a subjective, reflexive matter that necessar-\nily must be felt by the individual whose identity is at issue. (1968:129\u201330)\nThe resulting dichotomy, and tension, between socially ascribed identities and\npersonally avowed and \u201cfelt\u201d identity always reappears in Goffman\u2019s later work\nand has provided the focus of subsequent critical commentary. Moreover, we can\n520 Symbolic Interaction Volume 26, Number 4, 2003\nsee his preference for this diminished array of concepts as merely one typical in-\nstance of how \u201cidentity\u201d increasingly came to be used in a wide variety of sociologi-\ncal theories as a place holder in the obvious gap that existed between accounts of\nsocial collectivities and accounts of social actions throughout the history of sociology.\nSince this gap had always been problematic for the explanatory claims of the disci-\npline, attentiveness to it would result in the comparative neglect of the conception\nof personal identity as represented by a set of marks that \u201cdistinguishes the per-\nson so marked from all other individuals\u201d (Goffman 1968:75). While the social\nsignificance of such a conception may be indisputable, its sociological significance\nwas minimized. In this way, then, and despite a plethora of sociological studies of\nidentity, the field of study of the significance of \u201cpersonal\u201d identity and the related\nprocesses of personal identification has become poorly cultivated. The category it-\nself has become hard to make out since it has appeared only in the shadow-light\ntypically available for the illumination of such residual categories in sociological\nanalysis.\nBelow I suggest that the flexible application of Garfinkel\u2019s generic \u201crespecifica-\ntion program\u201d to these treatments of identity issues in conventional sociological in-\nvestigations provides the opportunity to rescue the category \u201cpersonal identity\u201d\nfrom this comparative neglect. A recent empirical study of the work of forensic\ninvestigators in one particular English police force illustrates this suggestion.\nFROM RESIDUAL CATEGORY TO RESEARCH FOCUS\nGarfinkel\u2019s (1967) \u201cethnomethodology\u201d seeks to study the ways in which human\nsubjects acting in concert with one another produce their own and recognize one\nanother\u2019s \u201csensible\u201d and \u201caccountable\u201d embodied actions and utterances. It aims to\nprovide empirical descriptive studies of what Garfinkel (1967:11) calls \u201cnaturally\norganized ordinary activity.\u201d The production, recognition, and organization of such\nordinary activity constitutes the foundation of social order\u2014what he refers to as the\n\u201clocally produced, naturally organized, reflexively accountable phenomena of order.\u201d\nScholars routinely describe Garfinkel\u2019s program as a \u201crespecification\u201d of the human\nsciences (Garfinkel 1991, 1996; Garfinkel and Wieder 1992; Lynch 1993; Lynch and\nBogen 1996). Such a respecification treats the classical themes and standard vocab-\nulary of the human sciences as \u201cunexplicated terms\u201d for those locally and naturally\noccurring social phenomena that are objects of disciplinary attention. Adopting this\nprogram changes how we understand such objects of study in the human sciences.\nIn addition, Lynch and Bogen (1996:273) have described such respecification as a\nprocedure in which any human science concept or problem or method is reexam-\nined as a \u201cmatter of routine local relevance for a particular kind of practical in-\nquiry.\u201d During these reexaminations, we can expect to see how social actors deploy\nany such concept, problem, or method in the course of their everyday activity.\nUnder the banner of \u201crespecification,\u201d we are to examine phenomena described\nas (for example) the \u201crules, signs, production, causes, inquiry, evidence, proof,\nResidual Categories and Disciplinary Knowledge 521\nknowledge, consciousness, reason, practical action, comparability, uniformity, reli-\nability, validity, objectivity, observability, detail and structure\u201d (Garfinkel and Wieder\n1992:177). However, we are not to examine these phenomena as philosophical or\ntheoretical problems requiring professional analytic solution but as \u201cmundanely\nand routinely avowed, ascribed and observably presupposed\u201d features of ordinary\nsocial actions. The preferred strategy for such inquiries has been the study of situ-\nated activities in their natural settings in order to observe (and sometimes to gain)\nthe resources routinely deployed as constitutive of competent membership in such\nsettings (e.g., Garfinkel 1986; Garfinkel, Lynch, and Livingston 1981; Livingston\n1986; Travers 1977; Travers and Manzo 1997).\nThus the notion of respecification encourages a focus on identity matters as an\namalgamation of a range of local, revisable occasioned relevances of social actors. It\npromotes the investigation of identity matters as they arise and are dealt with in the\nsocially organized practices of everyday life. Such investigations, overall, aim to ex-\nplicate what is involved in identity matters as they are made available by and to sit-\nuated actors in the course of their co-construction of the orderliness of specific so-\ncial contexts\u2014identity not as an attribute of a person but as a \u201ccourse of treatment\u201d\nshaped and deployed by specific actors in determinate social and organizational\ncontexts. A number of recent studies of social identity and self-identity\u2014two of\nGoffman\u2019s three characterizations of identity\u2014have contributed to the realization\nof such an aim (e.g., Eglin and Hester 1992; Hester and Eglin 1997; Watson 1998),\nalthough even here, personal identity seems ignored. Let us turn to a consideration\nof one group of such actors and the way in which an accountable orientation to the\ntopic of identity\u2014especially personal identity\u2014constitutes a central preoccupation\nof their working lives.\nFORENSIC INVESTIGATION AND PERSONAL IDENTITY\nAll police forces in the United Kingdom employ staff with specific responsibility for\nthe forensic investigation of crime scenes. Depending on the force in question,\nthese staff have a variety of titles (including scenes of crime officers, scientific sup-\nport officers, forensic investigators, and crime scene examiners). I refer to them\nhere as crime scene examiners2 (CSEs) since this term best captures their primary\nfunctions\u2014to search for physical evidence at crime scenes, to determine the poten-\ntial value of such evidence, and to secure and store evidence for subsequent analy-\nsis. CSEs also interpret the relevance of the evidence to police intelligence and\ncriminal case construction and in all of these ways contribute to the wider crime\ninvestigation and detection process.\nDuring much of 2000, I conducted an ethnographic study of the work of a group\nof five CSEs stationed in one division of an English Constabulary. I combined par-\nticipant observation of the examination of a large number of domestic burglary\nscenes with extensive informal interviewing of CSEs and other police officers in-\nvolved in crime investigation, collection of a range of documentary information\n522 Symbolic Interaction Volume 26, Number 4, 2003\nrelating to scene examinations, and attendance at divisional meetings concerned\nwith crime detection in the area.\nConsistent focus on the nature of personal identity and personal identification\nwas a matter of overwhelming occupational priority for this staff group. This orien-\ntation is not a matter for theoretical speculation but one of mundane competence\nand organizational accountability. The group continually displayed this orientation\nin their practical activities at crime scenes, in the paperwork accounting for these ac-\ntivities, in their talk to victims during the course of scene examinations, in the work\nnarratives exchanged among themselves, in the processing of the results of their\ncrime scene examinations, and in the performance measurements used to assess the\neffectiveness of their contributions to organizational objectives. Despite several\nstudies of the process of criminal investigations (e.g., Ericson 1993; Hobbs 1988;\nManning 1977; Morgan 1990; Sanders 1977) and a developing corpus of studies on\nthe representation of forensic evidence and expertise in judicial settings (e.g.,\nJasanoff 1995; Lynch 1998; Lynch and Jasanoff 1998), the practice of crime scene\nexamination has not previously been the subject of detailed sociological inquiry.\nCSEs structure the overall process of scene examinations by trying to create a\ncognitive reconstruction of the sequence of events that occurred during each bur-\nglary under investigation. They achieved this cognitive reconstruction by interpret-\ning a variety of material signs of movement and activity at the scenes as well as an\naccumulated knowledge of a repertoire of typified and standardized burglary\nmodus operandii as part of their accumulated background knowledge of burglaries.\nAn orientation to such a reconstructive process has long been referred to in texts on\ncriminal investigation (e.g, Kind 1987; Nickell and Fischer 1999; White 1999), since\nEdmund Locard wrote of \u201cre-creating\u201d the criminal from traces left. However, the\nseemingly intuitive and fugitive nature of the process has meant that it has usually\nbeen a resource for instruction rather the topic of empirical research.\nCSEs themselves formulated it only in the most general way: as a matter of accu-\nmulated professional expertise. They recognized the likely imprecision of their re-\nconstruction while arguing for its usefulness in shaping and focusing each examina-\ntion by reducing what would otherwise be its almost indefinite scope. This reductive\nuse is especially important since CSEs have constantly to make fateful judgments\nabout the efforts made to search particular scenes in light of their knowledge of\nscarce resources, the range of alternative demands on their time, and their concern\nwith the measurement of their work effort by the use of a restricted range of perfor-\nmance indicators. These judgments are informed by both prior understandings of\n\u201cnormal\u201d or \u201ctypical\u201d burglary scenes and the constant comparison of such a priori\nexpectations with the emerging details of the particular scene in question. These\nCSEs were sensitive to the need for both the deployment of some such preliminary\nframework for the organization of their approach to the scene and the willingness\nto suspend, enhance, or modify its use by the close observation and registration of\nthe specific details of each unique scene visited. CSEs sought in their own work and\nvalued in others\u2019 work an ability to deploy an intelligent and methodical process\nResidual Categories and Disciplinary Knowledge 523\nthat avoided the dogged application of a preconceived expectation of the nature of\nthe scene and facilitated the flexible use of their unique professional skills.\nThe CSEs\u2019 orientation to an essentially reconstructive impulse remains pre-\nserved in both their photographic records and in the notes they make in the course\nof the scene examination. CSEs use professional judgment to determine the exten-\nsiveness and intensiveness of a photographic record, along with a projected assess-\nment of its value\u2014largely for evidential or expository purposes. It can of course be\nargued that all those involved in the process of investigating crime are informed by\na similar combination of retrospective gaze and projective orientation. However,\nthe CSEs\u2019 contribution is distinguished by how these considerations are continu-\nously reformulated and redirected through the discovery, contextual interpretation\nand collection of physical evidence in and through the course of a technologically\nenhanced examination of the crime scene. For CSEs, then, emergent reconstructive\naccounts are measured against, developed alongside, and revised through the de-\ntailed collection and documentation of physical evidence.\nIn the case of the burglary examinations, a limited number of such types of phys-\nical evidence regularly appeared. These included footwear marks and impressions,\nfibers from clothing found at points of entry to the burglary, tool marks left on\ndoors or windows that had been forced open, broken glass, and paint fragments\nwhere the suspect had damaged paintwork on entry, fingermarks, body fluids, and\ntissue suitable for DNA profiling.\nThese forms of physical evidence vary in the strength of their contribution to\ncrime detection and prosecution. The usefulness of many of them depended on fea-\ntures of their precise location as well as their relationship to other forms of informa-\ntion available in the wider police investigatory context in which they could be inter-\npreted. However, CSEs always treated fingerprints and body fluids and tissue as\nespecially valuable to the investigation of crime, because they were the only forms\nof evidence recognized as capable of capturing the personal identity of suspects. For\nthis reason, CSEs devoted the greatest attention in the course of their examinations\nof burglary scenes to the discovery and recovery of these evidential traces of per-\nsonal identity. However, the practical activities involved in the discovery and collec-\ntion of these two forms of forensic evidence drew on different technologies and fol-\nlowed different trajectories.\nCSEs usually made the initial identification of fingerprints relevant for and capa-\nble of further examination at burglary scenes by using available light or by deploy-\ning oblique lighting. Examiners had specialist light sources available, but their use\nraised health and safety issues. Thus examiners did not normally use them, except\nwhen searching scenes where more serious crimes had been committed. Following\nthe initial observations of potentially valuable fingerprints, CSEs typically began\nmore detailed work by brushing powder very lightly over particular areas of (or ob-\njects in) the scene to establish the quality of any potentially recoverable marks. Once\nsuch marks became visible, CSEs identified their contours so that they could brush\nalong the contours of the ridges without filling in or erasing them. This technique\n524 Symbolic Interaction Volume 26, Number 4, 2003\nresults in powder becoming fixed to the oily ridge deposits, with the success of the\ntechnique depending on the condition of the original mark, the right choice of fin-\ngerprint powder, and the skilled application of that powder by the examiner.\nThroughout this process, the examiners prospectively oriented to what they\nknew fingerprint analysts would require for matching a fragmentary mark at the\nscene to a fingerprint record of a suspect in the relevant database. The CSE should\nnot send prints to the bureau that turn out to be unsuitable for matching since that\nwould signal his or her incompetence. As the print is being developed in situ\u2014or at\nthe stage where it is photographed or lifted via an adhesive acetated sheet\u2014the ex-\naminer hopes to see ridge detail, or, more precisely in the vocabulary of the finger-\nprint world, \u201csecond level\u201d ridge detail. \u201cFirst level\u201d ridge detail refers to the over-\nall patterns repeated across all fingerprints, and while such detail is relevant for the\ncataloging of fingerprints (and some patterns are more rare than others) they do\nnot have individualizing value.\nSecond-level detail is made visible by attending to specific points in the paths\ntaken by the friction ridges of the fingerprint. CSEs sometimes refer to such points\nas Galton details, following the work of Francis Galton, and fingerprint examiners\nhave developed a vocabulary of terms to designate different kinds of such points,\nfor example, \u201cridge endings,\u201d \u201cbifurcations,\u201d \u201clakes,\u201d \u201cdots,\u201d \u201coverlapping ridges.\u201d\nSecond-level detail is required for individuation, and CSEs search for this detail as\nthey develop a mark and decide whether it is worth keeping and submitting to spe-\ncialist examiners.3\nDNA collection is a less complex process. It requires limited skills and can be\neasily converted into a simple protocol. What matters most in collecting DNA evi-\ndence are the methods of releasing the biological sample from the object on which\nit is found and of avoiding contamination of the suspect crime scene DNA source\nby other DNA deriving from a different human subject. To collect a potential DNA\ncrime scene stain\u2014for example, a possible bloodstain on the sharp edge of a drawer\nthat a burglar seems to have pulled from a chest of drawers and left on the floor\u2014\nCSEs carry out a few simple actions. The method consists of using three swabs\nmoistened with sterile water: the first is used to lift the biological material from the\nrelevant surface, the second is used to sample material at some nominal distance\nfrom the biological material, and the third is simply moistened and then retained\notherwise unused. The second and third swabs serve as controls by collecting any\nrelevant contaminants; the examiners hope that the first swab contains the neces-\nsary DNA to profile a suspect stain.\nThe contingencies that surround the collection of DNA evidence differ from\nthose that apply to fingerprint collection. CSEs must identify the potential stain in\nthe first place. A CSE needs to be reasonably sure that the stain is of human origin\nand potentially relevant to the crime. Depending on the surface on which the stain\nis found, CSEs may have to cut away the material and send it directly to the labora-\ntory instead of swabbing it. Moreover, all of these possibilities have to be deter-\nmined in the course of a once-and-only examination, since the bulk of this kind of\nResidual Categories and Disciplinary Knowledge 525\ncrime scene examination can only take place in a relatively short time before the\npresence and actions of others contaminate the scene.\nThe practical mastery of these\u2014and other\u2014trace evidence collection techniques\ncomprises a dominant element in the routine work of crime scene examiners. In the\ncase of fingerprint collection, unlike DNA collection, crime scene examiners deal\nwith the construction of a complex artifact that demands constant visual attention\nand manual dexterity throughout the course of its construction. Moreover, CSEs in-\nform their visual attention by knowledge of what is required to establish an even-\ntual match between the scene artifact and an available\u2014or potential\u2014fingerprint\nrecord. Scene examination requires constant decision making about what work is\nworth doing with a variety of contact trace materials discovered at a variety of\ncrime scenes. The amount of work involved here can vary significantly but usually\ninvolves the creation of artifacts that others will later treat as the equivalent of\u2014or\nas stand-ins for\u2014the real-world objects from which these artifacts (the scanned fin-\ngerprint lift or the DNA electoropherogram, for example) were constructed.\nThe individualizing logic of criminalistic practice underpins decisions to pursue\nthese and many more kinds of work, and the currently available repertoire of col-\nlection techniques and individual examiners\u2019 skills locally conditions them. These\ndecisions are also accountably oriented to a number of other cognitive presupposi-\ntions concerning the organizational routines and practical contingencies typical of\nthe conduct of criminal investigations and prosecutions. In this overall context, un-\nderstandings of the nature of personal identity and identification are activated in\ncrime scene examinations and are also displayed, contested, and negotiated in sub-\nsequent stages in the criminal justice process.\nOne of the most interesting features of the long history of criminalistic practice is\nthe intensity of its pragmatic concern with the parameters of what I have referred to\nthroughout this article as the residual category of personal identity. Other commen-\ntators (e.g., Sekula 1986; Valier 1998) have observed that exactly this feature of\ncriminalistics marks its departure from the seemingly related discipline of criminol-\nogy, whose focus has been more generic than individualizing, more theoretical than\ntechnical. A range of accounts describe the emergence and application of forensic\nidentification technologies in the latter half of the nineteenth century and the first\nquarter of the twentieth (e.g., Caplan and Torpey 2001; Ginzburg 1980, 1990; Joseph\nand Winter 1996; Torpey 1998). Conventionally, these studies suggest that the iden-\ntification of recidivist criminals (especially in quickly growing urban centers) be-\ncame a cause for state concern from the mid-nineteenth century. Criminalists gen-\nerally agree that the recognition of previously convicted criminals would serve to\nreduce their dangerousness, and they supported a number of technological initia-\ntives, including the police use of photography, anthropometric measurement, and\nfingerprinting.\nThe development of such individuating criminalistic technologies has been subject\nto a series of uncertainties. In particular, the question arises, how many similarities\nbetween an object and its impression or traces are necessary to establish confidence\n526 Symbolic Interaction Volume 26, Number 4, 2003\nin its individualization? The history of both fingerprint and DNA identifications re-\nveals a series of changes in the answers given to this question (see, e.g., Balding\n1999; Balding and Donelly 1995; Evett and Weir 1998; Evett and Williams 1995;\nWeir 1998). In addition, criminalists make important differences in their assump-\ntions about the use of these two technologies for the collection and analysis of the\nmaterial correlates of personal identity. Although they may understand fingerprints\nto signify the surface uniqueness of personal identity, they think DNA represents\nthe body\u2019s interior uniqueness. Whereas the former implies no more than adventi-\ntious superficial dissimilarity between individuals, the latter is often portrayed as\nconstituting the fundamental basis of both physiological and psychological proper-\nties of personal identity.4 Cole (2001) points out that the development of individu-\nating forensic identification has always involved assumptions about the behavioral\ndiagnostics potentially available through examining such features. Often, these as-\nsumptions have turned out to be unfounded. Interestingly, however, the CSEs\ntreated these assumptions as irrelevant speculations. The longevity and stability of\nthese individualizing features and their traces, along with the probability of their\ndiscovery at particular crime scene, mattered more to them. In this respect, they\ntreated both fingerprints and DNA traces as \u201cempty signifiers,\u201d in Cole\u2019s phrase.\nCONCLUSION\nThe long history and extensive variety of philosophical speculations and human sci-\nences studies of identity matters bears witness to the theoretical significance attrib-\nuted to the idea of identity. However, its representation in these specialist discourses\ndoes not capture its generic significance or how it is embedded in the ordinary activi-\nties and practical ways in which people accomplish joint actions. The work of\nGarfinkel and others challenges attempts to provide general and speculative theo-\nries that assert what identity is or is not and allow a casual treatment of the relation-\nship of such theories to the understandings, actions, and events they claim to de-\nscribe, illuminate, or explain. I encourage adopting an alternative proposal\u2014that\nwe should look at identity matters as they arise and are addressed in the course of\nordinary actions. Identity may well be an inescapable feature of human existence,\nbut we can understand why and how this is so much more successfully through ex-\namining local knowledge and practical action than we can by seeking to specify,\nmodify, or correct schematic theories of its essential features.\nIn this article I have taken particular interest in how one summary of sociological\nthinking about identity both reflected and contributed to the residualization of one\nof the three elements included in this descriptive framework. I have suggested that\nthis residuum can be illuminated by reference to an orientation to personal identity\neasily observable in the organized practices and local contexts of the work of crime\nscene examiners as they search for contact trace material at the sites of domestic\nburglaries. Knowledge of the material correlates and traces of personal identity\nalong with the mastery of current technologies for their capture, classification, and\nResidual Categories and Disciplinary Knowledge 527\nstorage provide essential resources for the work of these examiners. The application\nof this knowledge and these technologies together serve to constitute personal\nidentity as the object of forensic investigation. This not only reflects wider under-\nstandings of the material correlates of identity but also contributes to the changing\nconstellation of such understandings. For this reason, it seems likely that anyone\nseeking a contemporary illustration of Goffman\u2019s \u201cmarks of identity\u201d is more likely\nto choose the DNA profile than his own earlier choice of the fingerprint.\nWriting about a different but related issue, Smith (1996:194) commented that we\nshould replace those sociological approaches \u201cwhich give primacy to theory and\nwhose phenomenal universe is constituted by abstractions\u201d with one that \u201caims at\nknowing the social as people actually bring it into being. Its objects would not be\nmeanings but the actual ongoing ways in which peoples activities are co-ordinated.\u201d\nI believe this is true. If we cannot establish the connection between human science\nabstraction and the mundane world, which such abstractions seek to interpret, then\nthe function of such abstraction remains questionable. If we see any proposed\nhuman science understanding of identity as responsive to what matters to individu-\nals at all (and I cannot conceive of any useful human science understanding that\ncould ignore this requirement), then we must describe how identity matters to them\nin the local contexts of their everyday lives.\nNOTES\n1. There is not space here to document the history of commentary on this work. Studies by Man-\nning (esp. 1992, 2000) and Burns (1992) make major contributions of their own as well as pro-\nvide guides to the work of others.\n2. In the United States, such individuals are more often referred to as crime scene investigators.\n3. More detail of the exigencies of fingerprint matching and the use of such evidence can be found\nin Cole\u2019s (2001) excellent study of the history of this technology.\n4. A recent report of the U.K. Human Genetics Commission (2002) included a section on the fo-\nrensic uses of DNA. The commission argued that DNA is a more reliable informant than fin-\ngermarks since it is durable, can be amplified from minute amounts, and is recoverable from\nalmost every human cell or tissue, unlike fingerprints, genetic information is shared with\nbiological relatives, and that DNA is more \u201cinformation rich\u201d than fingerprints.\nREFERENCES\nBalding, David J. 1999. \u201cWhen Can a DNA Profile Be Regarded as Unique?\u201d Science and Justice\n39:257\u201366.\nBalding, David J. and Peter Donelly. 1995. \u201cInferring Identity from DNA Profile Evidence.\u201d Pro-\nceedings of the National Academy of Science 92:11741\u201352.\nBurns, Tom. 1992.
