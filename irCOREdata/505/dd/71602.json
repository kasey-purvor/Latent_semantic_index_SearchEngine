In addition, zonal variability\nwithin the tropics, such as long periods of El Ni\u00f1o\nSouthern Oscillation (ENSO)-like conditions (Stott\net al., 2002; Rosenthal and Broccoli, 2004) can have\nextra tropical influence through perturbation of the\nglobal hydrological cycle (Chappellaz et al., 1993).

Barker et al. \/ Earth and Planetary Science Letters 261 (2007) 93\u2013103our understanding is partial, since few sites preserve\ndetailed records beginning before the last glacial\nmaximum (LGM). Southern hemisphere localities are\nespecially poorly represented in this climate mosaic, yet\nthey are crucial to test phase relationships with polar\nregions as proposed by bipolar seesaw models\n(Broecker, 1998; Stocker, 1998). Here, these telecon-\nnections are examined through a 25 ka diatom-based\noxygen isotope record (\u03b418Odiatom) from the northern\nbasin of Lake Malawi (10\u201315\u00b0S, 34.5\u00b0E), providing the\nfirst long continuous record of its kind from continental\nAfrica. The \u03b418Odiatom record is complemented by a\nlower resolution deuterium record from palmitic acid\n(\u03b4Dpa) and extends previous multiproxy palaeolimnolo-\ngical findings from the lake's northern basin (Barry\net al., 2002; Gasse et al., 2002; Johnson et al., 2002;\nFilippi and Talbot, 2005).\n1.1. Modern climate, hydrology and limnology\nLake Malawi's climate is largely controlled by the\nnorth\u2013south migration of the inter-tropical convergence\nzone (ITCZ) that marks the meeting of the north-easterly\nmonsoon and the south-easterly trade winds (Fig. 1). A\nnorth westerly airflow can also bring rain of Atlantic\norigin to Malawi via the Congo basin (McHugh and\nRogers, 2001; Jury and Mwafulirwa, 2002). A single\nrainy season occurs during October\u2013March when the\nITCZ lies over the lake, and a dry season (April\u2013\nSeptember) is characterised by strong south-easterly\ntrade winds. Mean rainfall over the catchment is1350 mm yr\u22121, but there is a steep north\u2013south rainfall\ngradient due in part to the orographic influence of the\nnorthern Rungwe mountains. At the inter-annual scale,\nthe Malawi catchment straddles the boundary between\nthe southern subtropical and the equatorial climatic\nregions, which often respond to El Ni\u00f1o events by\nnegative and positive annual rainfall anomalies, respec-\ntively (Nicholson, 1997). In general, Malawi receives\ngreater or normal rainfall under La Ni\u00f1a conditions\nwhen the sea\u2013land temperature gradient increases and\nconvergence occurs over the continent, whereas in El\nNi\u00f1o years the ascending limb of the Walker circulation\nmoves eastward to the western Indian Ocean (Jury and\nMpeta, 2004). Patterns of sea surface temperatures in the\nsurrounding oceans are also important controls on the\nRossby wave across southern Africa, bringing greater\namounts of rain when the east Atlantic and Agulhas\nregion are warm and the west Indian Ocean is relatively\ncool (Jury and Mwafulirwa, 2002). It has been\ndemonstrated that under present boundary conditions\nhigher rainfall south of 15\u00b0S occurs when Greenland is\nrelatively cold and vice versa (Meehl and van Loon,\n1979). Correlation with the North Atlantic Oscillation\n(NAO) and rainfall over the region helps define this\nprocess and implies that the ITCZ shifts southward\nwhen the NAO driven westerlies are strongest (McHugh\nand Rogers, 2001).\nThe climatology described above identifies ultimate\nsource areas for Malawi rainfall as the western Indian\nFig. 2. A cleaned diatom sample from Lake Malawi comprised of\nAulacoseira nyassensis.\n95P.A. Barker et al. \/ Earth and Planetary Science Letters 261 (2007) 93\u2013103Ocean and the tropical Atlantic. The importance of each\nsource is not known and will change according to zonal\ncirculation patterns such as ENSO and relative sea\nsurface temperatures (SSTs) (Nicholson, 1997). Atlantic\nwaters will become more isotopically enriched through\nrecycling of transpired water from the Congo Basin as\nhas been suggested from elsewhere in East Africa\n(Rozanski et al., 1996; Russell, 2004). The oxygen\nisotope composition of rainfall in the Lake Malawi\ncatchment interpolated from the Global Network of\nIsotopes in Precipitation (GNIP) stations is \u22126 to \u22129\u2030,\nwith a marked \u2018amount effect\u2019 (higher rainfall intensity\ngiving lower \u03b418O and \u03b4D) during the wet season\n(IAEA\/WMO, 1998). Deuterium values are similarly\ninterpolated to be \u221214 to \u221238\u2030. Direct precipitation\nand river discharge each represent \u223c50% of the water\ninput to the lake, while evaporation and outflow con-\ntribute \u223c84% and \u223c16% of output, respectively (Ber-Table 2\nChronology of core M98-2P based upon varve counts and radiocarbon resul\nDepth Calendar yr before 1998 14C age 2sigma maximum C\n(cm) (14C yr BP) (cal yr BP) (\n5 323 \u2013\n35 552 \u2013\n53 698 \u2013\n139.5 B 2510\u00b150 2150\n248.5 B 4020\u00b165 4080\n379.5 B 6260\u00b165 6750\n500.5 B 8820\u00b1110 9500 9\n537.5 B 9550\u00b1120 10560\n648.0 B 11450\u00b185 13160\n744.0 C 14450\u00b1100 17790\n900.0 B 21000\u00b1240\nCalibrated 14C ages using Calib 4.2 (Stuiver et al., 1998), and a polynomial\n450 yr was subtracted before calibration.

Water isotope values from the\nnorthern catchment are similar to rainfall estimates\n(\u22123.1\u2030b \u03b418Ob\u22125.4\u2030 and \u221214\u2030b \u03b4Db\u221231\u2030)\n(Branchu et al., 2005). In contrast to these low rainfall\nand runoff values, we found the lake had high isotope\nvalues (+1.8b\u03b418Ob+2.3\u2030) measured at three stations\nfrom the southern basins to a depth of 50 m with only\nlimited variation between measurements (Table 1).\nThese values are comparable with deeper profiles from\nthe central basin made in 1976 at the end of the wet\nseason (Gonfiantini et al., 1979) and others from the\nnorthern basin at the end of the dry season in 1993\n(Branchu et al., 2005). Our water isotope measurements\nwere also made at the end of the dry season and repre-\nsent maximum epilimnion values. Strongly enriched\nisotope values from the lake water, relative to those of\nthe major inputs, testify to the fractionation exerted by\nevaporation from the lake surface.\nDiatoms dominate the phytoplankton during the dry\nseasonwhen strong lakewater mixing (April\u2013September)\n(Hecky and Kling, 1987), low humidity and SE winds\nreinforce radiative cooling of surface water. All diatom\nsilica is subject to some degree of dissolution during\nsinking and early diagenesis, but a rather high proportion\n(7 to 11%) of diatom production is permanently buried in\nMalawi (Bootsma et al., 2003). Aulacoseira nyassensis\n(Fig. 2) is the most ubiquitous diatom in cores from the\nnorthern basin and comprises the majority of the diatom\nbiomass measured for \u03b418Odiatom. In addition to the\ndiatom-based oxygen isotopes, we measured compound\nspecific hydrogen isotope ratios as an alternative and\ncomplementary (to \u03b418Odiatom) insight into water isotope\nfractionation and palaeohydrology.

Materials and methods\nThis study is based on core M98-2P core (9\u00b0 58.6\u2032 S,\n34\u00b0 13.8\u2032 E, 363 m depth) from the northern basin of the\nlake collected by International Decade of East African\nlakes (IDEAL) programme members (Barry et al., 2002;\nGasse et al., 2002; Johnson et al., 2002; Filippi and\nTalbot, 2005). Eight AMS radiocarbon analyses\n(Table 2) have been made on either total organic matter\nfrom M98-2P (seven dates) or charcoal (one date). The\ndates were found to be conformable to six previous dates\non a nearby core (M98-1P) when correlated using ash\nmarker horizons (Johnson et al., 2004). Core M98-2P\ncontains sections of laminated sediments interspersed\nwith homogeneous lake mud and five cm-scale ash\nhorizons (Fig. 3). Detailed stratigraphical data is pro-\nvided in earlier publications (Barry et al., 2002; Gasse\net al., 2002; Johnson et al., 2002; Filippi and Talbot,\n2005).\nCore M98-2P was sampled at approximately 10 cm\nintervals for diatom-based oxygen isotope analysis,\ngiving a mean resolution of 200 yr. Diatoms wereFig. 3. Oxygen and deuterium isotope data from Lake Malawi core M98-2P.

For most samples the 63\u201338 \u03bcm or\n38\u201320 \u03bcm fraction contained the majority of the diatom\nbiomass. Our methodology successfully separated the\ndiatoms from clays and volcanic ash. However, the\ncleaning process also removed small diatom taxa\nincluding most periphytic species and resulted in near\nmonospecific samples dominated by A. nyassensis\n(Fig. 2). Although this skewed the diatom assemblage,\nit also eliminated any possible inter-specific variability\nin the acquisition of oxygen (Leng and Barker, 2006). A\nstepwise fluorination method was used to strip hydrous\ncomponents from the diatom silica before a full reaction\nwith BrF5 (Leng and Barker, 2006). The oxygen\nliberated was then converted to CO2 and normalised\nagainst NBS standards. Sample reproducibility was\napproximately 0.3\u2030.\nSediment samples for \u03b4Dpa were freeze-dried, and\nfree lipids extracted using an Accelerated Solvent\nExtractor ASE200 using 2:1 (v\/v) dichloromethane\n(DCM):methanol. Carboxylic acid fraction is isolated\nfrom the total extracts using solid phase extraction\n(Aminopropyl Bond Elute\u00ae), and was then methylated\nusing anhydrous 2% HCl in Methanol. Methylatediatom biovolume was calculated according to (Gasse et al., 2002). The\n97P.A. Barker et al. \/ Earth and Planetary Science Letters 261 (2007) 93\u2013103carboxylic acid fractions were further purified using a\nsilica gel flash column chromatography with DCM as\nthe eluant (removes hydroxyl-carboxylic acids). Hydro-\ngen isotope analyses were performed using a gas\nchromatography \u2013 high temperature conversion \u2013\nisotope-ratio mass spectrometer (Huang et al., 2002).\nCompounds separated by GC column were converted to\nH2 by a pyrolysis reactor at 1445 \u00b0C. Six pulses of\nhydrogen reference gas with known \u03b4D values were\ninjected via the interface to the IRMS, for the com-\nputation of \u03b4D values of sample compounds. Typical\nstandard deviation of triplicate analyses is b\u00b12\u2030.\nInternal standard heneicosane also showed consistent\n\u03b4D values throughout the analyses, with variability\nb\u00b12\u2030. The isotopic difference before and after\nderivatisation was used to calculate the \u03b4D value for\nthe hydrogen from the added methyl group (Huang et\nal., 2002). \u03b4D values obtained from individual acids (as\nmethyl esters) were corrected by mathematically\nremoving the isotopic contributions from added groups\nbefore reporting.\nStatistical treatment of the \u03b418Odiatom data used\nAnalyseries v.1.2 (Paillard et al., 1996). Singular\nspectrum analysis (SSA) was applied to enhance the\nsignal\/noise ratio and to highlight the periodicities\nevident in the raw diatom record (embedding dimension:\n20; Vautard\u2013Ghil autocovariance estimation) (Ghil et al.,\n2002). Data were re-sampled every 200 yr, normalised\nby their standard deviation and detrended for their long-\nterm linear trend before performing the SSA.

A part of this range is\naccounted for by lake water temperature as values of\n\u03b418Odiatom are governed by both temperature and the\nisotope composition of lake water (a function of source\nwater, precipitation and evaporation) at the time the\ndiatom frustules formed. Temperature has been estimat-\ned independently from these cores using the TEX86\nindex (the average number of cyclopentane rings\nincorporated into membrane lipids of Crenarchaeota)\n(Powers et al., 2005), and suggest surface temperatures\ncompared to modern values (25\u201329 \u00b0C) of \u22123.5 \u00b0C\nduring the LGM, \u22121 \u00b0C during the YD and around 8.2 ka\nBP, and values of +3 \u00b0C and +5 \u00b0C were calculated for\nca. 13.8 ka and 5 ka BP (Fig. 3). Temperature changes of\nthis order and published \u03b418Odiatom fractionation factorsof \u22120.2 to \u22120.5\u2030 per \u00b0C (Juillet-Leclerc and Labeyrie,\n1987; Shemesh et al., 1992) do not alter significantly the\n\u03b418Odiatom curve. Instead, the variation in \u03b4\n18Odiatom\nmust derive mainly from changes in the Lake Malawi\nwater isotope composition (\u03b418Olake), itself a function of\nprecipitation (amount and source), temperature, and\nevaporation. A sensitivity analysis of lake waters to\nchanges in climate parameters (Ricketts, 1998) has\nshowed that a 1\u2030 depletion in \u03b418Olake would need\neither a 3.7 \u00b0C decrease in temperature, a 6.7 mS\u22121\nincrease in windiness, a 17% decrease in humidity, or a\n1.4\u2030 depletion in \u03b418O of inputs. Since evaporation\nenriches the lake by 8\u2030 relative to precipitation at the\npresent day, large changes in water isotope values in the\npast will have resulted from shifts in precipitation\u2013\nevaporation (P\u2013E). Understanding of the acquisition of\n\u03b418Odiatom values by diatoms has increased significantly\nbut no study of a large lake has yet been able to make a\nfully quantitative reconstruction of lake water isotope\nhydrology analogous to that achievable from calcite\n(Leng and Barker, 2006). A major source of uncertainty\nis the early diagenetic alteration of frustules post mortem\n(Schmidt et al., 2001) that can cause an offset between\nlake water isotope conditions and that recorded by\nsedimentary diatoms. There is very little evidence of\ndissolution in these sediments although maturation\nprocesses causing infilling of pore spaces within the\nfrustule cannot be discounted. In the absence of a\ndetailed modern sampling programme, relating seasonal\n\u03b418Odiatom values from plankton tows to sediment trap\nand surface sediments, that is beyond the scope of this\npresent study, our interpretation is limited to relative\nchanges in \u03b418Odiatom.\nSupport for the predominance of water balance\nconsiderations in the interpretation of \u03b418Odiatom\ncomes from a correlation between diatom biovolume,\na surrogate for diatom productivity and \u03b418Odiatom.\nSingular spectrum analysis (Ghil et al., 2002) reveals the\nunderlying variability in these curves and a positive\nlinear correlation between the two filtered time series\n(r2 =0.63) for the last 15 ka. Diatom productivity is\ngreatest during the dry season today and during decadal-\nscale low lake level stages within the past 200 yr (Gasse,\nunpublished data). Before 15 ka the relationship\ndecouples, as other factors such as external loadings of\nSi and P, nutrients essential to diatom productivity,\nwould have become limiting under generally dry glacial\nconditions (Bootsma et al., 2003; Johnson et al., 2004).\nGood agreement is found between the \u03b418Odiatom and\n\u03b4Dpa values (Fig. 3). This is expected since lake water\nprovides the source of both the diatom oxygen and the\ndeuterium within palmitic acid (an aliphatic carboxylic\n98 P.A. Barker et al. \/ Earth and Planetary Science Letters 261 (2007) 93\u2013103acid that reacts with glycerol to form lipids in a broad\nrange of organisms) providing that the lipids extracted\nfrom the sediments are of aquatic origin. The source of\nthe organic material is important since higher plants can\nbe enriched in \u03b4D by 10\u201360\u2030 relative to aquatic tissues\ndue to direct use of meteoric waters and physiological\nfactors (Sachse et al., 2004). A correlation with lake\nwater isotope values and measured \u03b4D from palmitic\nacid contained in lake sediments across North America\nhas been established (Huang et al., 2002), but in a large\ncomplex lake such as Malawi, this assumption requires\nfurther testing. The organic matter in these deepwater\nLake Malawi sediments is largely of algal origin as\ndemonstrated by C\/N, \u03b413C, \u03b415N and HI values,\nalthough the relative contribution of terrestrial and\naquatic sources is variable (Filippi and Talbot, 2005).\nOur interpretation of the two diatom and palmitic\nacid isotope curves is therefore broadly similar, yet\nsome differences can be anticipated according to the\nprocesses of isotope acquisition, the provenance of the\npalmitic acid and seasonal differences between the\nistope hosts. Seasonality in lake water isotope values is\nimportant since diatom productivity is skewed toward\nthe cooler, windier dry season. Like the bulk organic\nmatter, the aquatic lipids contain a significant algal\ncomponent derived from a weighted sum of all three\nmajor groups; namely Cyanobacteria, Chlorophytes and\ndiatoms, found in the lake in varying ratios during the\nannual cycle (Bootsma, 1993). Whereas the diatoms will\nincorporate a dry season isotope signature, if the\npalmitic acid was largely from other algae, a greater\nproportion of the deuterium would be incorporated\nduring the strongly stratified wet season. Inter-annual\nvariation between algal groups and the amount of\nbiomass they produce will have occurred throughout\nthis 25 ka series, leading to differences in the season\nrepresented by the deuterium isotopes. The oxygen and\ndeuterium isotope curves are likely to diverge most\nstrongly when diatom productivity is low relative to that\nof the lake as a whole, as probably occurred during the\nLGMwhen Si limited diatom production (Johnson et al.,\n2002), or if high runoff brought more abundant higher\nplant material to the deep waters.\n3.1. The pre-Holocene period\nA general pattern of increasing \u03b418Odiatom values,\npunctuated by a series of wet\u2013dry fluctuations, can be\nobserved from the core base to ca. 15 ka, when\nfollowing a major wet period, oxygen isotope values\noscillate at centennial to millennial scales around the\nmean of the record. Given the range of indicators whichsuggest evidence for relative aridity at the LGM and a\nlower lake level (Gasse et al., 2002; Johnson et al., 2002;\nBarker and Gasse, 2003; Filippi and Talbot, 2005), it is\nperhaps surprising that both of the isotope curves do not\ncontain values that are more enriched in the heavier\nisotope. One explanation of relative high values of \u03b4Dpa\nis that the majority of autochthonous production at this\ntime derived from Cyanobacteria and Chlorophytes\nusing nutrients delivered during a shortened wet season\nor from upwelling. Low diatom biovolume and biogenic\nsilica flux (Johnson et al., 2002) indicates only weak\ndiatom growth occurred around the LGM, probably due\nto silica becoming rapidly limited if catchment inputs of\nsilica were reduced under a drier climate (Fig. 3), and a\nswitch toward other algal groups would have been\nlikely.\nSpecific wet-dry periods in the \u03b418Odiatom record can\nbe correlated with proxies from neighbouring sites,\nincluding the relatively wet interval 17\u201318 ka that can\nbe found in lake Tanganyika to the north and in the\nMakapansgat stalagmite oxygen isotope record from\nSouth Africa (Holmgren et al., 2003). More generally,\nthe millennial scale variability in the \u03b418Odiatom record\ncorresponds to temperature changes at high latitudes,\nalthough broadly opposing relationships are observed\nwith Greenland (GISP2; Grootes et al., 1993) and during\nthe postglacial period with Antarctica (eg. Dronning\nMaud Land (Oerter et al., 2004)) (Fig. 4). According to\nthese data, centennial-scale dry periods in Malawi occur\nwhen Greenland is relatively cold (Brook et al., 2005),\nand vice versa. For example, dry events ca. 21.5\u201322 ka\nand 19\u201320 ka coincide with cool periods in the\nGISP2 temperature reconstruction. Moreover, the most\nextensive dry period in our record from 17.8\u201314.5 ka\ncorresponds to the cool interval preceding the B\u00f8lling\u2013\nAller\u00f8d (BA) in Greenland and the major postglacial\nwarming of Antarctica. The highest \u03b418Odiatom value\n(+39.7\u2030), representing the most intense dry period in\nthis sequence is recorded at 12.5 ka, the start of the\nexceptionally cold Younger Dryas in Greenland. Con-\nditions at lake Malawi during the Younger Dryas are\ncomplex and show a second maximum dry phase at\n11.8 ka before the establishment of wet Early Holocene\nconditions. Relatively high concentrations of periphytic\ndiatoms, a diminished silica flux to the lake and organic\nmatter composition support the interpretation that these\nwere relatively dry periods (Gasse et al., 2002; Johnson\net al., 2004; Filippi and Talbot, 2005). Other data from\nthis core show low P, suggesting reduced river inputs,\nand variable volcanic ash inputs brought either by\nnortherly wind or rivers to the lake from the northern\ncatchment during many of the dry intervals described\nFig. 4. Comparison of SSA smoothed \u03b418Odiatom curve, with a peat humification series from Lynch's Crater, Australia (illustrated here by the\nsmoothed detrended % absorption series) (Turney et al., 2004), GISP2 \u03b418O (Grootes et al., 1993) and Dronning Maud land, Antarctica \u03b418O (Oerter\net al., 2004). The SSA of \u03b418Odiatom is based on the first 6 principal components accounting for 68% of the explained variance. The Lynch's Crater\nrecord is detrended and smoothed using a 3 point Gaussian filter (Oerter et al., 2004). Grey bands represent relatively wet periods in lake Malawi.\n99P.A. Barker et al. \/ Earth and Planetary Science Letters 261 (2007) 93\u2013103here (Johnson et al., 2002). The organic matter record\nshows high primary productivity from 17.9\u201316.5 ka and\nhas been interpreted as indicative of high nutrient flux\nfrom increased runoff (Filippi and Talbot, 2005). But,\ndiatom productivity was low at this time, suggesting that\nat least the supply of Si did not increase, and instead it\ncould be envisaged that stronger vertical mixing led to\nmore efficient regeneration of N in the epilimnion,\nthereby shifting lake water stoichiometry and altering\ncompetitive interactions amongst phytoplankton in\nfavour of Cyanobacteria.\nAround 13.5 ka there is a remarkable decrease in\n\u03b418Odiatom coeval with a minimum in diatom periph-\nyton (Gasse et al., 2002). This negative oxygen isotope\nspike has been replicated and corresponds to a similar\nexcursion in the \u03b4Dpa data and corresponds to a peak in\nwater temperature inferred from TEX86 (Powers et al.,\n2005). These independent measurements indicate that\nthese unusual values had a physical underpinning and\ncannot be dismissed as experimental error. The\ncorrespondence with \u03b4Dpa suggests that isotopic\ndilution was brought about by an increase in rainfall\nover the catchment, and the lake reaching its overflow\nafter several millennia of closure may have amplified\nthe response. This remarkable wet phase in the Malawi\nbasin occurred during the Antarctic Cold reversal\n(Jouzel et al., 1995) and the second half of the warm\nBA period in Greenland. It falls within the major\npostglacial expansion of more northerly lakes that\nbegan ca. 15 ka in Tanganyika (Gasse et al., 1989),Victoria (Johnson, 1996), Rukwa (Haberyan, 1987;\nBarker et al., 2002), Manyara (Holdship, 1976),\nMagadi (Roberts et al., 1993) and others (Barker and\nGasse, 2003), although these proxy (mainly diatom)\nrecords show a protracted wet period until at least the\nYounger Dryas.\n3.2. The Holocene\nThe Early and Middle Holocene reveals a series of\nwet\u2013dry fluctuations around the mean values for the\nsequence and is relatively stable compared to earlier and\nsucceeding periods (Figs. 3 and 4). The record suggests\nrelatively high P\u2013E at ca. 11.0, 9, 7.5 ka and maximum\naridity at 10, 8.2, and 6.4 ka. Relatively dry conditions at\n8.2 ka are well known from several high resolution sites\nin East Africa (Barker et al., 2004). Around 7 ka we\nobserve some minor differences between the shape of\nthe \u03b4Dpa and that of the \u03b4\n18Odiatom curve. Seasonal\ndifferences in the acquisition of water isotopes could\nagain have occurred as proposed for earlier parts of the\nrecord, although contamination with higher plant\nmaterial would offer a simpler explanation to high\n\u03b4Dpa, especially as inputs of terrestrial remains from the\nlake margin are suggested by the organic matter\ncomposition (Filippi and Talbot, 2005). The period\nends with a wet pulse at 5.3 ka confirmed by a sharp\npeak in \u03b4Dpa and coeval with the warmest lake water\ntemperatures (Powers et al., 2005). After 5 ka, the\nfrequency of changes increases, but the underlying trend\n100 P.A. Barker et al. \/ Earth and Planetary Science Letters 261 (2007) 93\u2013103indicates relative aridity around 4 ka followed by a\nreturn to values around the mean of the series.\n4. Palaeoclimatic implications\nMillennial\u2013centennial scale fluctuations in the Lake\nMalawi \u03b418Odiatom values are inversely related to\nGreenland temperatures during the deglaciation as\nmeasured by the GISP2 temperature record (Grootes\net al., 1993). Relationships with Antarctica are less clear\nsince the stadial\u2013interstadial pattern is weaker during\nthe deglaciation, although some suggestion of an\nopposing or lagged response to ice core temperatures\n(Blunier and Brook, 2001) can be observed, in\naccordance with the bipolar seesaw hypothesis\n(Broecker, 1998). Positive fluctuations of the large\nnorthern ice sheets and to a lesser extent Antarctic sea\nice, increased meridional temperature gradients, sucked\nheat from the tropics, intensified trade wind circulation\nand cooled surrounding oceans to varying degrees. The\ncooling of tropics at the LGM would have reducedFig. 5.

Moreover, GCMs suggest that the\ngreater relative cooling of the northern hemisphere\npushed the austral summer Hadley cell to the south\n(Clement et al., 2004). The product of these processes\nwas that much of tropical Africa was relatively cool and\ndry at the LGM, even in the southern hemisphere,\ndespite positive insolation forcing south of the equator\n(Johnson et al., 2002; Powers et al., 2005; Barker and\nGasse, 2003). It is likely that glacial forcing was\nextremely important throughout the deglaciation, with\nshifts in the interhemispheric asymmetry altering\nrainfall patterns.\nCooler SSTs have been estimated for the oceans\nsurrounding southernAfrica at the LGMandGCMs using\nthese values generate drier conditions over the region\n(Pinot et al., 1999). Estimates suggest temperatures in the\nsouth-eastern Atlantic fell by up to 3.5 \u00b0C (Schneider\net al., 1995), whereas those of the south-west Indian\nOcean were diminished by only 1.4\u20132.6 \u00b0C (Bard et al.,\n1997).

SSTs in the Indian Ocean are\na critical control on moisture fluxes to the continent\n(Goddard and Graham, 1999) and are likely to contribute\nto the post LGM centennial scale wet\u2013dry intervals\nrevealed by \u03b418Odiatom. ENSO forcingwould be supported\nby apparent links across the Indian Ocean to N. Queens-\nland. Here a peat humification record fromLynch's Crater\n(Turney et al., 2004) thought to result from ENSO\nprocesses, reveals a millennial scale structure similar to\nthat of our \u03b418Odiatom record (Fig. 4). For the most part the\ntwo records are in-phase, with an exception around 17 ka\nthat may arise from chronological uncertainties.\nThe structure of our record is comparable to evidence\nof abrupt events from sites in equatorial East Africa\n(Gasse, 2000) and processes such as ENSO that\npresently initiates a rainfall dipole between equatorial\nand southern Africa must have been largely subservient\nto meridional mechanisms especially glacial forcing.\nFor example, modelling of a freshwater discharge to the\nNorth Atlantic of a magnitude similar to that occurring\nduring the Younger Dryas cool event, produced slightly\nwarmer surface temperatures in the equatorial Atlantic\nand over the African continent (Dahl et al., 2005). Under\nthis simulation the ITCZ shifted southward and north-\neasterly trade winds were strengthened. Monsoon winds\nfrom the Indian Ocean would also become more\nnortherly, such that reduced convergence occurs and\nsummer rainfall would be diminished (Dahl et al.,\n2005). In addition, stronger winds from the south during\nthe austral winter would augment evaporation from\nLake Malawi as demonstrated by periods of reduced P\u2013\nE, marked by high \u03b418Odiatom and enhance upwelling\nand diatom productivity in the northern basin. An\nalternative ENSO-based explanation of the Younger\nDryas has been proposed that involves the Pacific into a\nLa Ni\u00f1a pattern due to orbital configurations (Clement\net al., 2001). Using the present as a reference, this\nscenario would tend to favour wetter conditions in\nsouthern Africa, which would be at odds with our data.\nThese isotope data show strong connections with\nglobal climate variability, and it is interesting to observe\nthat quasi-periodicities in the \u03b418Odiatom time series are\nanalogous to periods found in other climate proxies. A\ndominant periodicity of 2.3 ka yr, broadly describes the\nspacing of the dry events in this sequence (Fig. 5a). This\nis exemplified by the first two principle components\n(PC1+2) generated by the SSA that account for almost\n41% of the explained variance (Fig. 5b). We also observe\nperiods at 4.5 ka and less strongly at 1.6 ka in both theraw and filtered \u03b418Odiatom data. The former is best\nrepresented by PC3 (14% of the variance) and the 1.6 ka\ncycle is mapped by PC 4+5 that cumulatively explain\n14% variance (Fig. 5c and d). Similar periods are found\nin Antarctica at 4.4 ka and 2.4 ka in Vostok temperatures\n(Yiou et al., 1995), and in Greenland (GISP2) where a\n2.3 ka cycle occurs in the K+ data, and is thought to\nrepresent meridional atmospheric circulation (Mayewski\net al., 1997). Combination tones and harmonics of orbital\ncycles have been proposed as mechanisms behind these\nfrequencies (Yiou et al., 1995), as has solar activity\n(Clemens, 2005). There is less evidence in the time series\nanalysis of direct modulation by thermohaline circula-\ntion since, although the relatively weak 1.6 ka cycle is\nbroadly equivalent to North Atlantic rhythms (Bond\net al., 2001) given chronological constraints (N. Atlantic\nis rather 1.47 ka).\nFurther quantification of the isotope hydrology \u2014\nclimate relationships from these important sites requires\nextensive calibration of the processes leading to the\nacquisition and retention of the isotope signal in these new\nhost materials. Nevertheless, the Lake Malawi \u03b418Odiatom\nrecord confirms the presence of centennial\u2013millennial\nscale dry periods in the southern tropics of East Africa\nsince the LGM. We find expressions of the deglaciation\ndriven by re-organisation of SSTs and atmospheric\ncirculation, at a period known from studies of solar\nvariability (Clemens, 2005). Furthermore, abrupt events,\nwell known from the equatorial and northern tropics\n(Gasse, 2000; Fleitmann et al., 2003) can be observed in\nthis southern hemisphere lake. These isotope data suggest\nan important role for the tropics in at least amplifying, if\nnot even instigating changes transmitted through Earth's\nprimary atmospheric circulation systems.\nAcknowledgements\nWe wish to thank our partners in the IDEAL project,\nand especially the co-ordinators Prof T.C.
