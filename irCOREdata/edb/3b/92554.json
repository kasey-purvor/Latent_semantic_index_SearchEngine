The specific focus of interest is a variety of body modification\npractices, including working out (at a gym) tattooing, piercing and cosmetic\nsurgery.  We want to argue, however, that the significance of this analysis\nextends beyond the topic of body modification to a broader set of issues\nconcerned with the nature of men\u2019s embodied identities.  In discussing the\nappearance of their bodies, the men we interviewed talked less about muscle\nand skin than about their own selves located within particular social, cultural and\nmoral universes.  The surfaces of their bodies were, as Mike Featherstone\n(1991) has argued, charged primarily with \u2018identity functions\u2019, allowing men to\nestablish a place for themselves in contemporary society.\nUsing a social psychological approach which can be characterised as a\ndiscursive analysis (Henwood, Gill & McLean, 1999; Lupton, 1998), we aim to\nmake connections between men\u2019s private feelings and bodily practices, and\nbroader social and cultural trends and relations.  This paper shows that in talking\nabout seemingly trivial questions such as whether to have one\u2019s nose pierced or\nwhether to join a gym, men are actively engaged in constructing and policing\nappropriate masculine behaviours and identities, regulating normative\nmasculinity.  We identify five key discourses or \u2018interpretive repertoires\u2019\n(Wetherell & Potter, 1992) which together constructed the meanings of attempts\nto modify the appearance of the body.  The five discourses or repertoires were\nfocused on the themes of individualism and \u2018being different\u2019; libertarianism and\nthe autonomous body;  unselfconsciousness and the rejection of vanity; a notion\nof the \u2018well-balanced\u2019 and unobsessional self; and self-respect and the morally\naccountable body.  Our analysis lends support to the claim that the body has\nbecome a new (identity) project in high\/late\/post-modernity (e.g. Shilling, 1993;\nFeatherstone, 1991), but shows how fraught with difficulties this project is for\nyoung men who must simultaneously work on and discipline their bodies while\ndisavowing any  (inappropriate) interest in their own appearance. The analysis\nhighlights the pervasive individualism of young men\u2019s discourses, and the\nabsence of alternative ways of making sense of embodied experiences.\nThe paper is divided into four sections.  In the first, recent theoretical work on\nmasculinity and embodied identity is discussed.  Next, we introduce this study in\nmore detail, discussing the sample, methodology and wider research project of\nwhich this forms a part.  We also outline our approach to the material.  The third\npart of the paper presents the analysis, examining the five discourses or\nrepertoires which we found to be constitutive of men\u2019s talk about the body\u2019s\nappearance.  Finally there is a short discussion and conclusion.\n3\nMasculinity, Identity and Embodiment\nOver the past decade, there has been a dramatic rise in the visibility of the male\nbody in the media and popular culture.  Men\u2019s bodies are on display as never\nbefore, from the muscular heroes of the cinematic action genre, to the \u2018sixpacks\u2019\nwho grace the covers of Men\u2019s Health, and the \u2018superwaifs\u2019 of contemporary\nstyle magazines (Tasker, 1993;Edwards, 1997; Nixon,1996).  Where once\nimages of women dominated advertising and magazines, increasingly men\u2019s\nbodies are taking their place alongside women\u2019s on billboards,   in fashion\nphotography, and large circulation magazines.  However, it is not simply that the\nnumber of images of the male body has increased; more significant is the\nemergence of a new kind of representational practice in mainstream popular\nculture, depicting male bodies in idealised and eroticised fashions, coded in\nways that give permission for them to be looked at and desired (Moore, 1988;\nSimpson,1994).  This genre of representation is not entirely new, and, as Abigail\nSoloman Godeau argues; \u2018contemporary representations of masculinity, either in\nelite or mass cultural forms, reveal significant correspondences to older visual\nparadigms of ideal masculinity\u2019 (1997, p. 21 \u2013 2).  In this way, past meanings are\n\u2018reactivated\u2019 from a classical tradition which held sway until the nineteenth\ncentury at which point \u2018nude\u2019 became equated with \u2018female sight\u2019 (Dudink, 2001).\nWhat is important about the current moment is that the coding of the male body\nas \u2018to be looked at\u2019 (Mulvey, 1975) disrupts conventional patterns of looking in\nwhich \u2018men look at women and women watch themselves being looked at\u2019\n(Berger, 1972, p.47).  The male (body) has become an object of the gaze rather\nthan simply the bearer of the look.  In the terms of  Bryan Turner\u2019s analysis, we\nhave become flaneurs, who \u2018survey and consume\u2019 others\u2019 bodies in the \u2018airport\ndeparture lounge\u2019 of postmodern society (Turner, 2000, p.42).\nA variety of explanations have been put forward to account for this shift in \u2018visual\nculture\u2019, variously crediting the gay movement, feminism, the style press, or\nconsumerism (and specifically the marketing of heterosexual women\u2019s desire)\nwith responsibility (e.g. Nixon, 1996; Mort, 1996; Moore, 1988; Simpson,1994;\nFeatherstone, 1991; Chapman & Rutherford, 1988; Edwards,1997; see Gill,\nHenwood & McLean, 2000 for a longer discussion).  While the reasons for it are\ncontested, there is widespread agreement that a significant change has\noccurred, in which men\u2019s bodies as bodies have gone from near invisibility to\nhypervisibility in the course of a decade.  This change is regarded as so\nsignificant that a number of anxieties  have been raised about its impact on men\n(particularly boys and young men), including concerns about health, self-esteem,\nbody image and eating disorders (see Grogran, 1999 for a review).  More\nfundamentally, there have been suggestions that males may increasingly be\ndefining themselves through their bodies, in the wake of social and economic\nchanges which have eroded or displaced work as a source of identity, particularly\nfor working class men (Henwood, Gill & McLean, 1999).\n4\nOne of the aims of the research project of which this paper forms a part was to\nexamine this claim, holding it up against men\u2019s lives.  While speculative, this\nmuch-repeated claim resonates with much contemporary social theory about the\nbody which has highlighted its centrality to \u2018the modern person\u2019s sense of self-\nidentity\u2019 in high modernity (Shilling, 1993 p.3).\nMost contemporary sociological writing about the body has been concerned to\nlocate its increasing significance in changes in the cultural landscape occasioned\nby the shift to what is variously characterised as high, late or post-modernity\n(Turner, 1984; Giddens, 1991; Featherstone, 1991; Shilling, 1993).  Central\namong these changes are the gradual \u2018desacralisation\u2019 of social life, the erosion\nof grand political narratives or  certainties, and the rise of both individualism and\nconsumerism (Shilling, 1993).  Giddens (1991) argues that the dissolution of\ntradition in late or high modernity has been accompanied by \u2018ontological\ninsecurity\u2019 and a reflexive concern with identity and the body.  Secure and stable\nself-identity no longer derives automatically from one\u2019s position in the social\nstructure, and in its place we are seeing attempts to ground identity in the body,\nas individuals are left alone to establish and maintain values with which to live\nand make sense of their daily lives.  In late modernity \u2018we have become\nresponsible for the design of our bodies\u2019 (Giddens, 1991, p.102).\nShilling (1993) argues that high modernity has produced an unprecedented\n\u2018individualisation\u2019 of the body, in which meanings are privatised and the body\nbecomes a bearer of symbolic value.  In consumer society it has become, in\nBourdieu\u2019s terms (Bourdieu,1986) a source of  symbolic capital, less because of\nwhat the body is able to do than because of how it looks.  Thus we are\nwitnessing an extraordinary fetishisation of muscles and muscularity in young\nmen at precisely the moment that fewer traditionally male manual jobs exist, and\nthose that do require less physical strength than ever before. Highly developed\nmuscles have become \u2018semiotically divorced\u2019 from specific class connotations,\nand are no longer indexical of participation in manual labour.\nDespite this,the work of Bourdieu alerts us to the ongoing significance of class\nfor understanding embodiment.  Bodies, for Bourdieu, bear the imprints of class\nin three main ways \u2013 through the individual\u2019s social location, the formation of\ntheir habitus and the development of their tastes.  The management of the body\nis central to the acquisition of status and to the maintenance of class (and other)\ndistinctions.  Skeggs\u2019s (1997) work on young, British working class women\nshows this vividly by highlighting the way in which they used the shape, styling\nand design of their bodies to resist or transgress class assumptions that\nrendered them inferior. \nOne related way of thinking about the rise of \u2018somatic society\u2019 (Turner, 1984) has\nbeen through the idea of \u2018body projects\u2019. This notion has been advanced as a\nuseful way of thinking about both the \u2018unfinished\u2019 nature of bodies through the\nlife course and the pressures in affluent Western societies to \u2018work on\u2019 the body,\ntransforming and accomplishing it as part of individual identity (Shilling, 1993;\nGiddens, 1991).  Featherstone (1991) argues that the body is charged as a\n5\nvehicle of self-expression, reinforced by consumerism.  Body projects are\nattempts to construct and maintain a coherent and viable sense of self-identity\nthrough attention to the body, particularly the body\u2019s surface (Featherstone\n1991).\nThe important insights developed in the theoretical writing discussed above\nconcerning the relation between the body and identity might lead one to suppose\nthat there had been a good deal of research on this topic.  But this has not been\nthe case.  Many writers lament the fact that the increasing theoretical interest in\nthe body has not been accompanied by empirical studies (e.g. Davis,1997;\nWatson,2000; Wacquant, 1995).  Nettleton & Watson  point to the \u2018theoreticism\u2019\nof the field and argue that \u2018the sociology of the body has, by and large, ignored\nthe voices that emanate from bodies themselves\u2019 (1998, p.2).  Even in gender\nstudies, where one might have expected a concern with the body to be\nparamount, there has \u2013 with notable exceptions (e.g. Connell, 1995; Watson,\n2000) \u2013 been little research into the embodied nature of gender identity for men\nwho are not disabled or chronically ill.  Arguably this failing is exacerbated in\nrelation to men\u2019s bodies compared to women\u2019s.  Watson  argues \u2018current\ndebates around men\u2019s health and perhaps men\u2019s place in society is crippled by\nthe lack of attention paid to personal accounts and perceptions of\nmaleness\u2019(2000, p. 43).  Indeed, it is something of an irony that while\nrepresentations of men\u2019s bodies have become a pervasive feature of the visual\nlandscape, in sociological research they remain largely invisible and unheard.\nA further problem with some writing on the body has been its failure to transcend\nthe mind-body dualism, with the result that over socialized and rationalized\nmodes of embodied selfhood is presented.  In this vein, Shilling and Mellor\naccuse Giddens of ignoring the sensual aspects of embodiment:\n\u2018Giddens views people as, essentially, minds who happen to occupy\nbodies; bodies which have been colonized by society to the extent that\nthey can increasingly be reconstructed in line with the minds eye view of\nwhat they should look like\u2019 (1996, p. 7).\nA third problem with writing located in the \u2018new sociology of health and illness'\nhas been that, despite a focus upon embodiment, consumption, risk and\nemotions, there is still a marked skew in favour of illness (Williams et al,2000;\nSaltonstall, 1993).  As Monaghan (2001) has pointed out, very little is known\nabout people\u2019s experience of health, particularly \u2018vibrant health\u2019 and physicality.\nThis study makes a modest contribution to this, with a focus upon young, healthy\nmale adults\u2019 experiences of embodiment.\nMapping Men\u2019s Embodied Identities\nThe research on which this paper is based set out to \u2018test\u2019 or examine some of\nthe theoretical claims discussed above.  In particular, it aimed to explore the idea\nthat the surface of the body has come to constitute a \u2018project\u2019 and key source of\n6\nidentity for young men.  By asking men to talk about their own bodies and those\nof other men, we sought to learn about their experiences of embodied identity in\nrelation to work,  education, leisure, consumption, media representations, health\nand a range of different kinds of intimate relationship including being a child,\nbrother, father, friend and partner.\nThis research is based on 140 semi-structured interviews with boys and men\naged between 15 and 35 in four British regional locations in the UK (London,\nBangor, Manchester & Newcastle).  Most of the interviews were carried out in\n1998 \u2013 1999, with the remainder conducted in 2000 \u2013 2001.  A second phase of\nresearch, based in Australia, is ongoing in 2003.  Men in all four British locations\nwere recruited from a variety of sites,  deliberately chosen to vary the extent to\nwhich, and ways in which, the men might be expected to be \u2018body conscious\u2019.\nSites included gyms, nightclubs, shopping centres, schools, universities, youth\nclubs and gay organisations.  The sample is socially diverse in terms of class,\n\u2018race\u2019, ethnicity and sexuality.  It does not contain any men who were visibly\ndisabled or who identified as such \u2013 and this is certainly an important ommission\nin  this discussion of \u2018body projects\u2019.\nMen took part in one of two types of interview \u2013 individual life history interviews,\nor focus group interviews in which they were in discussion with two or three other\nmen, as well as the male interviewer.  The two types of interview were designed\nto be complementary.  In the individual life history interviews topics were more\npersonal and intimate: the young men were asked to reflect upon significant\nmoments in their own biographies (eg. moving from primary to secondary school,\nfirst sexual relationship, leaving home), as well as more obviously body focused\ntopics related to bodily changes and body care.  In the focus groups the\nemphasis was less upon individuals\u2019 biographical accounts than upon discussion\nof issues and concerns (eg. body modification, pressures on men today, health\nand fitness).  The individual interviews and focus group interviews did not only\ndiffer in terms of substantive content, but also differed markedly in tone (cf.\nFrosh et al, 2001).  There was generally (as expected) greater personal\ndisclosure in the life-history interviews and, by contrast, many of the focus\ngroups were characterised by an ongoing banter and repartie that can be\nvariously understood as humourous, defensive, or competitive, and which we\nanalyse as part of the performance of gender in the interviews \u2013 a powerful way\nof \u2018doing masculinity\u2019.  This point will be returned to later.  Elsewhere we have\nproduced detailed analyses of the interviews in relation to consumerism,\ntransgression, relationships and feelings about the new eroticised\nrepresentations of the male body (Henwood, Gill & McLean, 1999; 2000; Gill,\nHenwood & McLean, 2001).  In this paper our focus is the broad topic of body\nmodification.\nThe topic of body modification was approached in the interviews in a variety of\nways.  Men were asked about their own practices in relation to their appearance,\ntouching on topics from shaving and \u2018grooming\u2019 to cosmetic surgery.  They were\nalso asked to talk about other men\u2019s bodies in a variety of different ways.  For\nexample, men participating in individual interviews were asked for reflections on\n7\nhow their own body and embodied identity differed from that of their father.  Men\nin the focus groups were shown pictures of bodies from adverts and magazines,\nwhich served as invaluable prompts for discussion.  Additionally they were asked\nmore general questions about body modification, such as \u2018what do you think\nabout body piercing\u2019 or \u2018how do you feel about the increase in the number of\nmen having cosmetic surgery?\u2019\nIn relation to tattooing and piercing, the sample was probably representative of\nthe young (predominantly urban) male population as a whole.  About one third\nhad a tattoo and\/or at least one part of their body pierced (usually ears or nose),\nand a significantly bigger proportion professed an interest in or desire to modify\ntheir body in one of these ways.  However, only three of the men could be\ndescribed as heavily pierced, with rings or studs in nipple and tongue as well as\nmultiple piercings in their face and ears.  None fitted contemporary descriptions\nof the \u2018modern primitive\u2019 (Klesse, 2000; Vale & Juno, 1989)).   In terms of\n\u2018working out\u2019 it is our impression that our sample were slightly more likely to go to\nthe gym than the general population of their peers.  To our knowledge, none had\nundergone cosmetic surgery, although this was something that many men\ndiscussed at length and with great animation.\nIn undertaking this research, we had been led to believe that we would face\nconsiderable difficulties \u2013 if not hostility \u2013 in getting young men to talk,\nparticularly on a topic so private, intimate and sensitive as the body.  However,\nthis has not been our experience. Men talked openly and at length about their\nperceptions of and concerns about their bodies, and about a range of bodily\npractices.  Indeed, far from being reluctant to talk about their bodies, many men\nseemed adept and happy to do so.\nWhat was striking, however, was that in talking about their bodies men\nrepeatedly drew upon a very limited range of discourses or repertoires.  Our\ninitial interest in examining differences between men \u2013 along lines of age, class,\n\u2018race\u2019 and sexuality \u2013 gave way to a fascination with the similarities between\nmen\u2019s accounts (which is not to say that a the differences are unimportant, and\nthey remain a central focus of this research \u2013 see Henwood et al, 1999).  The\ndegree of congruence between men\u2019s talk was at times astonishing: the same\nexpressions and figures of speech would recur in interview after interview, so\nthat when we read the transcripts we often wondered whether a typing error had\nled to inadvertent duplication of the same passage in multiple interviews.  But\nthis was not the case.  Instead it became clear that men\u2019s talk about the\nappearance of their body is structured by a very limited range of  key discourses.\nIn the remainder of this paper we discuss the five which we identify as most\nimportant.\nBut before moving to the analysis it is worth saying a few words about our\napproach to the interview material.  In characterising our analysis as discursive,\nwe are not intending to weigh into the rather sterile debates about\nfoundationalism and constructivism, or the material versus the discursive.  We\nwould endorse the position of many writers in arguing that these dichotomies are\n8\nnot helpful: the material and the discursive are inextricably linked, and nowhere\nmore clearly than in the body, as the very notion of embodied identity is designed\nto show (Davis, 1997; Watson, 2000; Ussher, 1997; Scott and Morgan, 1993).\nThe focus on discourses is intended to point up the deliberative nature of\ncontemporary identities (Giddens, 1991).  We argue that  the presence or\nabsence of tattoos or piercings on the bodies of our interviewees is far less\ninteresting in sociological and social psychological terms than the justificatory\nnarratives they employed to account for their body modification practices.  In\nusing a discourse analytic approach we are interested in exploring the\n\u2018interpretive repertoires\u2019 or \u2018practical ideologies\u2019 used by men to construct their\nidentity ( Wetherell,  Stiven & Potter, 1987; Burman &Parker, 1993; Wetherell &\nPotter, 1992), and we show how 5 \u2018discursive selves\u2019 are constitutive of men\u2019s\nbody modification talk.\n1. \u2018Being different\u2019: individualism and the rebellious self\nOne of the most widely shared and taken for granted themes in the entire corpus\nof interviews concerned individualism and, specifically, the value attached to\n\u2018being your own man\u2019 and \u2018being different\u2019.  It is somewhat paradoxical that the\nthing which most united the 140 men we talked with was their conviction that\nthey were different from other men.  Nevertheless, this feeling was clearly\nstrongly held and central to the men\u2019s senses of self.  Few men made any\nattempt to account for their sense of difference, either in terms of their personal\nbiography or social location\/identity; for the vast majority it was asserted as a\nself-evident truth.  Our interviews lend support to claims that the body and\nconsumption are used by men as vehicles for \u2018expressive individualism\u2019.\nInterestingly, though, the theme of \u2018being different\u2019 was used to justify widely\ndivergent and even opposing product, body modification or lifestyle choices.  For\nexample, some men argued that they bought brand label clothes to \u2018be a bit\ndifferent\u2019, while others used precisely the same argument to justify why they did\nnot buy particular brands.  This highlights an important point: namely that to\nunderstand men\u2019s embodied identities it is important to examine their\ninterpretative repertoires  or discourses and not just their specific  behaviours.\nThe men in our sample used three means to accomplish themselves as\nindividuals who are \u2018different\u2019, in addition to outright assertion. \nRebels without a cause. First, there was a widely shared attack on uniformity and\nconformity. It is often said of the cohort aged between 15 and 35 that they are an\na-political generation, \u2018Thatcher\u2019s children\u2019, steeped in individualist and\nconsumerist values and with no interest in social change  (Pilcher & Wagg, 1996;\nHayes & Hudson, 2001). Our research indicates that things are more complex\nthan this.  Like other researchers, we found little evidence of political radicalism\namong our sample, and, indeed, individualist and consumerist values were rife.\nHowever, despite this, we did find evidence of a strong attachment to the notion\nof rebellion \u2013 as expressed through the desire to \u2018be different\u2019.\n9\nUnlike some earlier generations of \u2018rebels\u2019, for example the 1968 generation or\nthe punks of the mid to late 1970s, the generations represented by our 20 year\ncohort appeared to have no particular target for their rebellion, and no particular\nsubstance to their demands.  In fact, they frequently used the very things that\nhad been targets of previous generations\u2019 rebellion \u2013 consumerism or a desire to\nbe extremely wealthy \u2013 as tools or emblems of their rebelliousness\nIn as much as their rebellion can be said to be about anything, it is clearly a\nrevolt against conformity and uniformity.  These themes emerged again and\nagain in our data, with hostility to everything associated with the conventional:\noffice work, marriage, the 9 till 5 day, etc..  These themes are not unambiguous,\nbecause clearly many of the men were also simultaneously attracted to security\nin jobs and relationships, and despite sneering at the idea of \u20182.4 children\u2019 this\nwas an aspiration as well as something to be attacked for many men (and a\nreality for several others).    However, a central part of establishing their identity\ninvolved attacking those things deemed mainstream or conformist.\nSport and exercise routines were frequently discussed in terms of difference\nversus conformity.  Again, we should point out that opposite choices could be\ncharacterised in the same terms \u2013 with both the decision to join a gym or not to\njoin a gym depicted in relation to these themes.  Several men who did not use a\ngym justified their decision in terms of the conformist nature of gym culture;\n(others characterised it as boring, false or \u2018posy\u2019).  Members of one focus group\nexpressed the concern that joining a gym lead to a loss of independence, and a\nworrying change of attitude among men, predisposing them to become\nunthinking followers! Frequently contrasts were made with more collective or\nsociable forms  ofexercise such as team sports, or \u2018pitting oneself against the\nelements\u2019 which was perceived as more indicative of a free and independent\nspirit.\nAsserting autonomy.  Another means of accomplishing oneself as an individual\nwho is different involved claiming complete independence and autonomy in\nrelation to all  body (and other) choices.  Connell  (1987;1995) has argued that\nthe value of \u2018independence\u2019 is a central feature of hegemonic masculinity, and\nour research would support this.  We found that many men attached significantly\ngreater authority to choices that had (apparently) been made independently of\nany outside advice or influence.  Elsewhere, we have discussed men\u2019s\nconsiderable discomfort and ambivalence about conceding that their perceptions\nof physical attractiveness might be in any way influenced by marketing or\nadvertising, with only those who were critical of these processes admitting that\nthey might play a part in  structuring  desires and subjectivity (Gill et al, 2000).\nGenerally, men were keen to characterise any decision \u2013 particularly those about\ntheir bodies \u2013 as entirely their own, unaffected by influence from parents,\nteachers, friends, lovers or the media.  Phrases such as \u2018not jumping on the\nbandwagon\u2019 or \u2018doing your own thing\u2019 recur throughout the interviews.  This can\nbe seen in the extract below in which a white  working class male in his late\ntwenties  explains why he has pierced ears and would consider getting a nose\nstud.\n10\nJohn: I think to some degree it is a sort of a tribal marking.  You know, its\nlike, its saying I am this kind of person isn\u2019t it. You know, associate me\nwith all those other kinds people who are like that, you know.  I am not\nmainstream, I am not normal.  And its something that you can, you can\u2019t\nmiss, you know, so they are sending a message to every individual they\nmeet.  But I would, I wouldn\u2019t imagine, well I don\u2019t know.  Perhaps it\u2019ll just\nbecome accepted as well.  You know, people don\u2019t tend to care too much\nabout nose piercing these days and stuff.  Whereas like 10 years ago they\nwould have done and stuff.  You know, and like, you know when I first got\nmy ears pierced at school, it was always a bit dodgy.  You know, and my\nparents didn\u2019t really like it.  And you had to be really careful which ear you\ngot done, cos one of them meant you were a poof but they other one\ndidn\u2019t.\nInt: Which way, which way round?\nJohn: I can\u2019t remember.  I can\u2019t remember.  I got both ears pierced and\nsaid sod them.  (15)\nHere, the rebelliousness made explicit in the statement  \u2018I am not mainstream, I\nam not normal\u2019 is implicitly reinforced by John\u2019s defiance of his parents wishes\nand also his refusal to observe semiotic conventions about signalling sexual\norientation.  He constructs himself as someone who dares to be different.  He\nalso emphasizes that his piercings were done long before they became normal\nor accepted, and thus cannot be considered as evidence of him merely following\na trend.  Although he uses the notion of \u2018tribalism\u2019, it is clear that his piercings\nare less about any kind of group or subcultural identification than  they are\ncommunications about the self which are sending \u2018messages\u2019 to other people.\nThis supports Soyland\u2019s analysis that \u2018the decorated body is no longer described\nas very important as a way of signalling group identity, but highly important for\nindividual identity\u2019 (1997 p.229; see also Sweetman, 2000)\nCriticising other men.  The claim by individual men that they are different is made\nmore persuasive through the construction of a number of implicit and explicit\ncontrasts with other men.  Thus while men characterised their own decisions as\nindependent, those of other men were compared unfavourably.  For example,\none man argued that men\u2019s magazines are bought by people who need\nsomeone or something to \u2018tell them how to live their lives\u2019, but that he did not\nneed this.\nAnother focus group discussion followed a similar theme, with the conclusion\nthat being different and above influence meant rejecting all (brand) labels.\nInt:You mentioned Dolce & Gabbana there, I mean, do you think labels\nplay a big part in it?\nPaul:Yeah, I would have said so, definitely.  It\u2019s all, its all a big image\nthing, isn\u2019t it, really?\n11\nJohn:How to be [inaudible] on a magazine.\nPaul:Well, this is it.\nFine thinking\nJohn:And people treat it like the Bible.  I\u2019m not saying people to, but I\nreckon people do.\nJake:See something in it and they want to copy that.\nPaul:Well, this is it, yeah.  This is it.\nJohn:It\u2019s in this magazine, it costs this much so it must be cool.  Who\ncares what it looks like or smells like or whatever.\nInt:What kind of clothes do you like yourself, or do you buy?\nPaul:Loose, scruffy, no labels.  (8)\n In this extract, the representation of magazine readers is that they use\nmagazines like (life) style Bibles, slavishly copying the fashions displayed,\nregardless of what they actually look or smell like.  The speakers construct their\nown identities contrastively in terms of the intrinsic value of their own choices,\nand their defiant refusal to buy labels.\n Men  frequently compared their own autonomous choices with those of other\nmen depicted as  \u2018sheep-like\u2019, fakes\u2019 or \u2018clones\u2019.\nOwen:\u2018Well I hate.  Everyone buys the same.  You see all the lads on a\nFriday, Saturday night, and they\u2019re all wearing the same shirts.\n[words ommitted]\nGareth:There\u2019s no individualism, you know.\nOwen:There\u2019s a lot of fakes around as well, that\u2019s the thing.  (10)\n2. The libertarian self and the autonomous body\nThe desire to be regarded as independent and autonomous is also evident in the\nsecond discourse identified.  In this, men constructed a libertarian model of the\nself which stressed individuals\u2019 rights to do whatever they wanted with their\nbodies.  While the \u2018rebellious self\u2019 emphasised mental independence and\nautonomy, this libertarian discourse stressed individual bodily autonomy.  Put at\nits simplest, this discourse asserted: it\u2019s your body so you can do what you want\nwith it.    The existence of this repertoire probably owes a great deal to feminist\ncampaigns about the body, especially relating to abortion, fertility and childbirth,\neach of which promoted a set of rights which flowed from bodily integrity.  It also\n12\nhas resonances with campaigns about homosexual equality and the age of\nconsent.\nThis discourse was used most frequently in relation to questions about cosmetic\nsurgery, with almost every man constructing his answer in terms of an\nindividual\u2019s right to choose.  Perhaps more than any other topic,cosmetic surgery\ncreated a consensus among the men with the vast majority defending an\nindividual\u2019s choice \u2013 as long as it was  for the \u2018right\u2019  (see below) reasons. Here\nare 3 examples.\nMike:I wouldn\u2019t say I get on my high horse about it.  If someone wants\nplastic surgery  and it helps their self esteem, fine.  Personally if someone\nwants to have plastic surgery, then jump on the bandwagon and condemn\nthem.  And go \u2018oh well\u2019 you know, and take some sort of \u2018well\u2019, you know,\n\u2018aren\u2019t you happy with\u2019, you know that sort of quasi-religious, \u2018aren\u2019t you\nhappy with what God gave you\u2019 sort of thing.  (1)\nInt:And talking about the gym a bit earlier on and stuff.  Kind like a rise in\npeoples awareness of themselves arguably has increased over the last 20\nor 30 years.  I mean, so stuff like plastic surgery is a lot more common.  I\nmean, what\u2019s your position on something like cosmetic plastic surgery?\nSteve:Uff, dear!  If an individual wants to do it, he can do it.  (12)\nPete:I suppose if an individual\u2019s got some feature that really, really does\ntheir head in, you know, and can\u2019t cope with it and stuff, then if they want\ncosmetic surgery, fair enough.  (15)\nIn each of these responses the issue of cosmetic surgery is framed in terms of\nan individual\u2019s right to choose.  What was also fascinating about responses to\nthis question, however, was the way in which many of them took up a defiant\ntone, as if they were having to defend themselves against a strong counter\nargument.  In the first extract above the target of critique is made clear: it is quasi\nreligious arguments suggesting that one should be content with the body\nendowed by God.  Clearly the speaker believes that condemnation of cosmetic\nsurgery on religious grounds is widespread, and that, in answering the question,\nhe must contest this belief.  This was paradoxical in view of the fact that, far from\nbeing contested, there was almost complete unanimity on this issue.  While other\nspeakers did not index the argument they were critiquing so clearly, there was a\npattern among most of the responses to  phrase them in defiant terms.  One\ngets the sense from reading the transcripts or listening to the interviews on this\ntopic that men felt that they were responding to the existence of a very strong\nmoral agenda against cosmetic surgery.  Their replies are characterised by an\nanti-moralistic stance, and the elevation of the individual\u2019s right to self-\ndetermination over their body as the only truly ethical position.\n13\nThe position taken was an anti-authoritarian one, but, interestingly, one in which\nthe authorities being rejected were rarely specified.  Clearly most of the men\nbelieved that a libertarian position based upon bodily autonomy required\nconsiderable defence against authoritarian and moralistic counter arguments.\nHowever, the arguments are as significant for what they leave out as for what\nthey make clear.  What struck us most forcibly about this discourse of the\nlibertarian self and the autonomous body is that the self appears to be\ncompletely socially dislocated.  There is no sense of a self-in-interaction or a self\nas part of a broader collectivity of people.  In fact, the self whose rights to bodily\nself determination are being championed seems to be entirely isolated.  Whilst\nthe majority of men seemed to be at great pains to appear libertarian and to\ndefend the rights of the individual, few mentioned the social context in which\nindividuals wanting cosmetic surgery exist.  There was scant recognition of the\nkinds of pressures that might lead to someone being willing to undergo major\nsurgery to improve their life, and where pressures were recognised they were\nconstructed in exclusively individual terms.  It was striking  that few of the men\nconsidered challenges to narrow and exclusive definitions of attractiveness to be\nan option that was even worthy of comment.  A defiant individualism seemed to\nhave utterly eclipsed any other potential perspective.\nHowever, as we will show below, although no notion of the social or the political\nsets limits on this individualist libertarianism, there are other limits constructed\naround bodily autonomy: notably, one should not be vain, one should not be\nobsessional, and one should not \u2018let oneself go\u2019.\n3. Rejecting vanity: the unselfconscious self\nIf the men are attached to  notions of the rebellious self and the libertarian self,\nthey are also deeply invested in a rejection of vanity.  Vanity was discussed\nagain and again in the interviews as something to be condemned and guarded\nagainst at all costs.  More than this, being thought vain or narcissistic was clearly\nsomething profoundly feared by the vast majority of the men we interviewed, who\nemployed frequent disclaimers about any aspect of their behaviour that might\nconceivably attract the label \u2018vain\u2019.\nSeveral men in our sample used skin care products, including cleansers and\nmoisturisers for their face and body.  However, the decision to use such products\nwas universally justified in instrumental terms, rather than in relation to their\nappearance.  For example, many men accounted for their use of moisturiser in\nterms of the health of their skin (rather than its appearance).  One working class\nman from Newcastle offered us a detailed justification of his use of hand cream\nby reference to the damage engendered by his work as a welder.  Other men\nidentified problems caused by cold, wind or sun that necessitated use of skin\ncare products.\nWorking out at the gym was also frequently characterised in terms of health\nrather than appearance  by men who were gym users.  Men routinely distanced\n14\nthemselves from potential accusations of vanity by prefacing accounts of their\nbodily practices with disclaimers suggesting that they do not go to the gym to\nmake them look good, but to put them through their \u2018cardiovascular paces\u2019 or to\ntone otherwise flaccid muscles.  Others suggested alternative instrumental\njustifications including the need to train to get acceptance to the fire service, or\nbuild muscle for self-defence. Gay men were more likely than straight men to\nadmit that they were concerned about their appearance, but they too were\nsensitive to potential criticisms of themselves as narcissistic (cf Levine & Kimmel,\n1998).  Men who were not gym users often characterised gym culture as vain.\nWhilst they did not agree about the desirability of skin care products or gym\nattendance, then, they were in agreement about the undesirability of vanity.  We\nfound only two examples of someone characterising attendance at the gym as\nbeing primarily about achieving a particular look.  This was a Newcastle gym\ninstructor:\nPhil:People train for aesthetic reasons to look good and that tends to be\nabout, I would say, about 75% for appearance.  For appearance.  It\u2019s the\naesthetics.  Women definitely want to be sort of a little bit slimmer you\nknow, and blokes as well.  There\u2019s not that many people that come in and\nsay \u2018I am worried about my health\u2019 you know. (50)\nHowever, even though this man attributes to other people   a desire to look good\nrather than improve their health, it is significant that he is reluctant to apply the\nsame logic to his own training:\nPhil:I am more sort of interested in performance now than the\nappearance. (50)\n The other individual suggested that the desire to look good was just one of a\nnumber of his personal reasons for working out:\nInt: Do you work out yourself at all?\nRick: Yeah.  Every other day I go swimming, weights, walk a lot, cycling.\nInt: And do you enjoy going to the gym in that way?\nRick: Yeah, I think it\u2019s smart, and more like a ritual.  Not in order to, to put,\nto bulk up really.  It\u2019s something to do.  You look good, you feel good.  It\u2019s,\nI don\u2019t know, I smoke as well though, so I do it in terms of like, to make\nup, to make up for my vices, whatever.  (13)\nWith the exception of this Welsh young man, our interviewees were not prepared\nto admit that any of their bodily practices might have anything to do with the\ndesire to look attractive.  Clearly there is a powerful taboo in operation which\nmakes this very difficult for many men.  We are sceptical of the idea that physical\nappearance has no bearing on men\u2019s decisions to embark on punishing weight\n15\ntraining schedules, painful tattoos or body piercing.  Our analysis suggests that\nrather than being unimportant, the desire to achieve a particular look must simply\nbe presented in a way that does not transgress the taboo about appearing vain.\nIt is interesting to speculate about the extent to which this taboo operated\nparticularly strongly in the interview context.  There may be other contexts (e.g.\nin the gym with groups of other men, over long periods of time) in which the\ndisavowal of vanity would not be so central. Clearly, however, there is a certain\nlevel of concern for one\u2019s appearance that is deemed acceptable and\nappropriate by men \u2013 indeed, as we will see, there is great censure in store for\nthose who \u2018let themselves go\u2019.  The skill for men seems to be in negotiating what\nthe boundaries between appropriate concern and vanity.  \nWe must stress that we are not suggesting that men were deliberately\nattempting to deceive either the interviewer or themselves; it is not a\nstraightforward matter of them attempting to somehow mask the \u2018real\u2019 reasons\nfor particular behaviours.  Rather, our point is that vanity and narcissism are\ncrucial constructs used by men to understand their own and others experiences\nof embodiment \u2013if only negatively - and to construct a meaningful psychological\nand moral universe.  This should become clearer as we develop our argument\nbelow.\nThe discourse of rejecting vanity was most evident in the talk about cosmetic\nsurgery.  Here, as we have seen, men developed libertarian arguments stressing\nthe right to individual self-determination.  However, men\u2019s defence of the right of\nanybody to have cosmetic surgery to change their appearance was not as\nunrestricted as it may have appeared earlier.  In fact, the limits to the discourse\nof libertarianism fall precisely at the point where an individual\u2019s desire for surgery\nmight be characterised as vain.  Vanity was repeatedly rejected as a legitimate\nreason for seeking surgery, while \u2018major disfigurement\u2019 constituted reasonable\ngrounds.  And the boundary between legitimate and illegitimate grounds was\nconstantly policed, as seen in the extracts from individual interviews below: \nMartin:Cosmetic surgery, it\u2019s just too extreme I think.  I mean to have\nplastic surgery you\u2019ve either got to have something seriously wrong with\nyour face or you\u2019ve got a massive nose or something.  Or you\u2019ve got to be\nincredibly vain.  (28)\nTom:If you\u2019ve got a defect, I don\u2019t see anything wrong with it, (...) but a lot\nof people are self-conscious, paranoid.  I\u2018d say paranoia comes into it a\nlot, you know, or perfectionists.  (16)\nIn the two above examples the dividing line between a legitimate desire for\nsurgery and an illegitimate one appears clear.  In the first, you would have to\nhave something \u2018seriously wrong\u2019, and in the second \u2018a defect\u2019.  This would\nqualify you for moral entitlement to surgery, raising your claim above the realm of\nvanity, paranoia or perfectionism.  But is the division really as clear as it seems?\n16\nThe extract below records the discussion of members of a London gym, after an\ninitial question from the interviewer.\nInt:Plastic surgery, what do you reckon to that?\nPaul:Unless you have got like a huge great birth mark across the whole of\nyour face, then it\u2019s fair enough.  But to change your nose, and you\u2019ve got\nthe other one now, the extension, haven\u2019t you.  They must be so paranoid\nabout themselves.\nRichard:It\u2019s sort of medical versus fantasy isn\u2019t it basically.  And if there is\na medical need, someone might have a psychological problem, you know,\nthey may have been tormented as a child, because their ears stick out too\nfar or something you know.  Then I think that is acceptable and if you\nhave been disfigured in an accident, and you know you\u2019ve seen\nreconstructive surgery.\nJohn:But not for vanity.  (19)\nHere birth marks are constructed as falling within the legitimate category, as are\nears that stick out, but surgery for reshaping noses is deemed illegitimate and\nvain.  If a treatment can be characterised as medically  necessary then it will\nescape the slur of vanity.  Of course, what is so interesting about this talk is that\nthe notion of vanity is entirely flexible.  While one person might argue that a\nfractured nose joint offered legitimate authorisation for surgery, another might\nargue that this falls into the realm of vanity alone.  The men we interviewed drew\ntheir lines in different places, including and excluding different kinds of surgery,\nand different kinds of justifications.  For one man, teasing at school about a mole\nrepresented \u2018psychological suffering\u2019 and therefore a legitimate case for surgery,\nwhile for others this would clearly fall within the \u2018fantasy\u2019 category discussed in\nthe extract above.  What some people understand as simply part of accepting\nwho you are and getting on with your life, others experience as trauma.  \nWe want to suggest that the particular place where men draw the line between\nlegitimate concern and vanity is less significant than the fact that they all believe\nthat a line can and should be drawn.  That is, for all the men interviewed a\ndivision between appropriate concern about one\u2019s appearance, and vanity or\nnarcissism was deemed a meaningful one.  Again, we would argue that this\nrelates back to the individualism of the men\u2019s psychic landscapes.  The men\u2019s\nvocabularies (both verbal and psychological) for making sense of embodiment\nare so individualistic that there was little space for even thinking about what\nmight lead someone to regard cosmetic surgery as the least worst option for\nthem (cf Davis, 1997).  It seems that the notion of vanity or narcissism has\nbecome a kind of catch-all category for explaining all of the things that are\nimpossible to think in purely individualistic terms.  Men are themselves struggling\nwith this, and their attempts to \u2018legislate\u2019 moral entitlement to surgery bear\nwitness to this: they want to invent a middle category between disfigurement and\nvanity, and are struggling to construct a discourse \u2018psychological suffering\u2019 to\n17\ncapture this (see extract above).  It is also evident in the silences in the\ninterviews about the meaning of tattoos, scarification and piercing.  We have\nalready noted in the first analytic section that these practices were sometimes\nunderstood in terms of conformity\/rebellion or indeed \u2018tribal\u2019 belongingness.\nHowever, it is worth pointing out that despite the fact that each of these practices\nresults in a visual modification of the body there was only one occasion within\nthe entire corpus of interviews when they were talked about as aesthetic\npractices.  To state this very crudely: men are making radical transformations to\nthe appearance of their bodies, but seem to have few resources  other than\nindividualism available to them to account for this.  A prime concern seems to be\nto avoid any accusation of vanity.\n4. Against obsession: the \u2018well-balanced\u2019 self\nThe fourth metadiscourse or interpretive repertoire did not have the prevalence\nor salience of those discussed so far.  Not all the men drew upon this discourse,\nbut for those who did it appeared to be a significant part of their self-definition\nand their construction of others.  At its heart was injunction not to take things too\nseriously, not to become obsessive, and to \u2018take people as they are\u2019.  Many\naspects of life were \u2018covered\u2019 by this repertoire, including work, body training and\nhealth.  There was a shared rejection of obsessiveness, with several men saying\nthat what they disliked about the gym was the obsessiveness of the people who\nused it.  This kind of talk also spilled over into discussions of surgical body\nmodification, with phrases like \u2018perfectionism\u2019 or \u2018hyper-perfectionism\u2019 standing in\nfor obsession.  \nAs in our consideration of vanity, an implicit norm about obsession was\ndeployed.  The term was used almost exclusively to characterise others\u2019\nbehaviour \u2013 only occasionally being applied to one\u2019s own behaviour so long as it\nwas safely in the past.  I used to be obsessional, our Geordie gym instructor\nconfessed, but I\u2019m alright now!  Generally, those who went to gym three times a\nweek would be seen by non-gym users as obsessional, and they in turm would\nregard their own behaviour as reasonable and well balanced, with the men who\ntrained six or seven days a week earning the \u2018obsessive\u2019 tag.  It is, then, a\nflexible category, but one which most men agreed was a Bad Thing.  One area of\ntalk that we have not yet been able to analyse in detail concerned diet and health\npractices, and it appears that constructions of obsession are rife here, especially\nin relation to \u2018healthy eating\u2019 choices. \nWhile men agreed that obsessiveness was something to be condemned, in\ncontrast the value of not taking yourself too seriously was widely championed.\nSeveral men praised the young men\u2019s magazines FHM and Loaded for having\nthis quality, and the ability to laugh at themselves.  Perhaps not surprisingly this\nwas most highly valued by the younger heterosexual men who came closest to\ncontemporary definitions of the \u2018lad\u2019.  The elevation of \u2018having a laugh\u2019 and \u2018not\ntaking yourself too seriously\u2019 fits in with contemporary ideas about\npostmodernism in popular culture, in which an ironic distance is said to\ncharacterise representations and offers an \u2018ideal\u2019 for people to aspire to.  There\n18\nwas a powerful sense in some of the interviews with young heterosexual men\nthat being seen to take yourself seriously contravened some unwritten rule.  Men\nwere keen to distance themselves from being seen as too serious, too\ncommitted, too earnest \u2013 things that were likely to attract a comment about\nobsession.  Being cool seemed to involve a stance of distance or disinterest.\nThis was also evident in the dynamics of the focus groups, in which almost any\ncomment which might be perceived as either serious or revealing of what an\nindividual man thinks and feels would be quickly ironised, usually by the speaker\nhimself (unless it was about football or sex, which \u2013 our evidence suggests \u2013\nwere deemed legitimate obsessions)! This was a fascinating pattern and requires\nfurther analysis to fully understand its implications for our understanding of the\nway that youthful masculinities are regulated in such group dynamics.\n5. Self-respect and the morally responsible body\nThe final discourse was organised around the notion that you should take care of\nyourself.  This was (again) a highly individualistic discourse in which men were\nconstructed as the individual managers of their own bodies.  Some of the talk\nusing this repertoire was absolutely fascinating for what it revealed about men\u2019s\nfeelings about the embodied self.  Many men employed a form of speech which\nrelied upon a bifurcation between the body and the self.  Several men were quite\nexplicit about this.  One told us\nGeorge:I smoke when I want to, and I don\u2019t when I don\u2019t.  I\u2019ve got an\nexcuse.  I\u2019ve got an agreement with my body and I can, I don\u2019t need to,\nbut I do when I want to.  (2)\nThis young heterosexual student clearly understood his body as a quasi-\nautonomous entity with which he could enter into an agreement.   Such\nconstructions emerged most clearly in talk about food choices and dieting and\nwere also found by Jonathan Watson (2000) in his study of men\u2019s health\npractices.  Few men were as explicit as this in constructing a boundary between\nself and body; but most men saw their body as something that was their\nresponsibility to discipline.  Here it becomes clear that men had to tread a\ndelicate path between an appropriate level of care and attention to one\u2019s body,\nand the twin pitfalls of vanity or obsession.   If they appeared too concerned\nabout their body or their looks they laid themselves open to accusations of vanity\nor obsession; if they seemed unconcerned they were at risk of being accused of\n\u2018letting themselves go\u2019.  Men tended to handle this delicate discursive and\npsychological problem  or \u2018ideological dilemma\u2019 (Billig et al, 1988) through the\nnotion of \u2018self-respect\u2019\nSean:Well, you still make the same effort don\u2019t you, every morning?  It\u2019s\nself respect (42)\nAs well as being an individualistic discourse, this repertoire is a highly moralistic\none.  Interestingly though the men in our sample appeared to reject moralism\nstrongly and championed individual bodily autonomy, in fact the autonomous\n19\nbody is only allowed to make certain choices: not caring for one\u2019s physical\nappearance is not one of them.  Parenthetically, it does not seem as though the\nsame moral reprobation is attached to health choices, with many men reporting\nvarious kinds of harmful bodily practices without criticism.  However, attending to\none\u2019s appearance (without becoming vain) is critical for young men (cf Watson,\n2000 on middle aged and older men).  This discourse sets up the individual to\ndiscipline their own body, and finds them morally culpable if they fail.  They are\ndeemed not simply too look unattractive, but to be moral failures, and are\ncensured for their transgression: they let themselves go.  This was seen most\nclearly in relation to getting fat, which attracted great disapproval.  As writers in a\nFoucaultian tradition have argued, increasingly the body is becoming read as an\nindicator of self-control and self-discipline.  In this way, fat represents not simply\nexcessive flesh, but an inability to control oneself (Bordo, 1993).\nThe men in this study bore witness to this.  They reported the fact that they\nwould be teased or policed by their friends about their appearance, and that the\nbeginnings of a paunch, in particular, would attract playful, but nevertheless\ncritical, comments.  They argued for the need to \u2018take care\u2019 of their bodies.  In\nthe final extract below, the link between taking care of one\u2019s body and one\u2019s self\nand the elision of fat with lack of interest in life as well as a conformist lifestyle is\nmade very clear:\nDominic:I just don\u2019t want to, I would like to look after myself and I, I mean,\nthe really important thing is still to be fit and healthy as you get older, and\ntake care of your body and your mind, and.  I don\u2019t want to end up like\nsome people I know.  Some people in my, even in my family and people I\nsee around, you know.  They just sort of  let them go. Themselves go, get\nfat and lose interest in everything, don\u2019t they. Do their 9 to 5 job, sit in front\nof the TV, and that\u2019s their life. That\u2019s not for me. (72)\nHere the look of the body is made to stand for the entire identity and assumed\nlifestyle, with fat symbolising a variety of negative characteristics with no direct\nrelevance to body weight.\nConclusion\nThis paper has been concerned with young men's talk about a variety of body\nmodifying practices including working out, weight training, body piercing,\ntattooing and cosmetic surgery.  Based on interviews with 140 British men of\ndifferent socio-economic, 'racial' and ethnic backgrounds, with various sexual\norientations, from different regional locations, and with an age span of 20 years\n(from 15 to 35) perhaps the most striking finding was the extraordinary\nhomogeneity of the men's talk.  Approaching the interviews with an interest in the\ndifferences between boys and men of different class, ethnic and regional\nlocations, we found instead significant overlaps in the men's talk about body\nmodification, and a widely shared set of discourses or repertoires for talking\nabout the body.  Indeed, just five discourses seemed to structure men's talk\n20\nabout body modification, and these appeared in interview after interview.  They\nwere focused on the themes of individualism and 'being different'; libertarianism\nand the 'autonomous body';  unself-consciousness and the rejection of vanity; a\nnotion of the 'well-balanced' and non-obsessional self; and self-respect and the\nmorally accountable body.\nThese discourses operated as structuring sets of ideas and behavioural\ninjunctions which worked together to construct the meaning of attempts to modify\nthe appearance of the body.  More than this, they revealed how men's bodies\nare inserted in a complex web of norms and social relations.\nThe notion of the body as a project has become a popular way of thinking about\nthe 'identity functions' performed by the body as a canvas for expressing the self,\nand a source of 'capital' for the individual.  Although the notion of body projects\nis, in our opinion, overly voluntaristic, and also fails to recognise that bodily\n'reconstruction' is not equally open to all (in particular to disabled and racialised\nbodies) it does usefully grasp parts of the experiences of the young men\ndiscussed here.  When the men talked about their bodies they talked less about\nmuscle and flesh and skin than about their own selves located within particular\nsocial, cultural and moral universes.  For them, the body was a key vehicle for\nestablishing a sense of individuality and for claiming a place in contemporary\nsociety.  Those who chose to tattoo or pierce their bodies or to build muscle\naccounted for it as an expression of their 'difference' and 'individuality', rather\nthan in terms of class or sub- cultural belonging or affiliation.  Those who did not\nmodify the appearance of their bodies in these ways nevertheless shared\nprecisely the same discourses for talking about embodied experience.\nA key finding of this research concerns the individualism of men's accounts of\ntheir body modification practices and those of other men.  It is not simply -- as\nthe notion of body projects suggests -- that the body was a site for individual\nexpression, but, more significantly, that the men's talk about their embodied\nidentities is saturated by the assumptions of individualism.  In fact so pervasive\nwas this that the men's body\/identity talk might be thought of as structured by a\ngrammar of individualism.  It was evident in the men's shared conviction that they\nwere different from other men; in their refusal to value choices or decisions that\nwere not deemed entirely independent (e.g. because of influence from peers or\nthe media) and in their shared belief about the right to bodily autonomy.  Equally,\nthe individualism could be felt in the systematic silences and absences in most of\nthe men's talk.  The autonomous individual, in these accounts, appears to be\nentirely socially isolated or dislocated.  There is little or no sense of a self-in-\ninteraction or as part of a wider set of collectivities.  This may in part be an\nartefact of the interviews' focus on embodiment which predisposed participants\nto think in individualistic terms.  Nevertheless it is surprising that even when\ntalking about the topics such as cosmetic surgery -- where, as we have seen, the\nnotion of autonomous individualism was under most stress -- there was no\nmention of the social, political or cultural context in which decisions such as that\nto alter an \u2018ugly\u2019, \u2018abnormal\u2019 or \u2018undesirable\u2019 feature of the appearance are made.\nThis is all the more remarkable in the context of interviews in which a central\n21\nfocus concerns the existence of 'new' pressures on men e.g. in relation to\nimages of the exemplary body (Gill et al, 2000)\nThe grammar of individualism was accompanied by a powerful libertarianism,\norganised around the assertion of the right to 'do what you want with your own\nbody'.  As we indicated in the analysis, we were struck by the defiant tone of\nsuch assertions which seemed to indicate that the men felt they were responding\nto a weighty authoritarian counter position. There are a number of possible ways\nof reading this.  One productive direction might be to regard such assertions as\npart of the practice and performance of masculinity, that is, as involved in 'doing'\nbeing a man, drawing on ideas that have been developed both by post\nstructuralist thinkers like Judith Butler (1990) and by ethnomethodologists\n(Kessler and McKenna, 1985; West and Fenstermaker, 2002).  Studying\nmasculinities and health, Saltonstall (1993) and Courtenay (2000) have each\nprofitably employed the notion that 'doing health' is 'doing gender'.  Courtenay\nshows that a range of health-promoting behaviours such as applying sunscreen,\navoiding unnecessary risk, asking for help, or seeing a doctor when sick involve\nflouting of hegemonic ideals of masculinity.  Not doing these things is the way of\n'doing masculinity': demonstrating strength, lack of vulnerability, independence\nand so on.\nThe same argument could be applied here, with the suggestion that the\nvehement protestations of individualism, independence and bodily autonomy\nwere not simply expressions of masculinity, but enactments of hegemonic ideals.\nIt is interesting that despite the repeated emphasis on independence and\nautonomy there were clear, normative limits to individualism and libertarianism --\nalthough they were not understood reflexively as such by the men themselves,\nand instead operated as 'obvious', taken-for-granted norms.  We considered\nthree in this paper -- the injunctions not to be vain, not to become obsessional\nand not to 'let yourself go'.  The analysis presented in the paper showed how\ntenaciously notions of appropriate masculine behaviour in relation to the body\nare regulated and policed.  Scathing censure greeted anyone thought to have\ntransgressed these norms -- deemed vain, a 'follower', 'clone', 'fake', or 'sheep',\nand anyone thought 'obsessional' or, alternately, to have lost 'self respect' and\n'let themself go'.  In line with the position outlined above it is evident that the\nbody is a site not only for the performance or enactments of masculinity, but also\nfor its profound and intimate regulation.\nNormative standards of masculinity were maintained in a variety of different\nways.  The discourse analytic approach used here showed that implicit and\nexplicit contrasts with other men were a powerful and persuasive means of\nupholding norms of masculinity like independence or lack of susceptibility to\ninfluence.  They were also an important means for men to articulate what they\ndid not want to become e.g. fat, boring, conformist or vain.  Indeed, it was\nstriking how much more readily the men articulated what they did not want, than\nthey professed their aspirations or desires.  This has resonances with\nMonaghan's study of bodybuilding culture which highlighted the desire of\n22\nbodybuilders to avoid looking or ageing like many of the people they saw around\nthem (Monaghan, 2001; see also Featherstone, 2000 on the 'heroes of ageing').\nAnother way in which normative masculinity was regulated was through the\nconduct of the interviews themselves -- particularly the focus groups.  The\n'humour' and banter in these groups frequently operated as an 'in your face' way\nof policing acceptable or 'normal' of masculinity, at least in the groups where all\nor most of the men identified as heterosexual.  For example, when the men were\nshown photographs taken from contemporary adverts or magazines of the\nmuscular torsos of men it was not uncommon for one of the heterosexual-\nidentified men to say to another: 'you fancy him, don't you!' or something along\nthese lines.  This would be the opening statement in a series of homophobic\nexchanges, designed to disavow any homoerotic desire in the speaker and to\ncast aspersions on the others' (heterosexual) manhood.  Similarly, as we noted\nearlier, many men practised a kind of cool distance in the focus groups, and\nthere were frequent occasions when speakers would quickly and deliberately\nironise or distance themselves from a comment that might be heard as too\nserious or too revealing.\nIn this respect both the conduct and content of the focus groups bore a strong\nresemblance to aspects of the wider culture of 'new laddism'.  The phenomenon\nof the 'new lad' has been understood in a variety of ways: as a backlash against\nfeminism (Whelehan, 2000; Faludi, 1991; Franks, 1999); as a hedonistic reaction\nagainst the constraints of the male adult role (Jackson et al, 2001); and as a\nreassertion of 'permissive heterosexual masculine scripts' (Nixon, 2001) against\nthe alleged inauthenticity of the 'new man' (see Gill, 2003 for detailed analysis).\nThe image of the 'new lad' to be found in magazines like Loaded or FHM mirrors\nthe assertions of masculinity espoused by many of the heterosexual men we\ninterviewed: anti aspirational and anti obsessional (except where beer, football\nand 'shagging' are concerned) hostile to the 'narcissism' of the 'new man'\n('grooming is for horses' opined a lad-mag editor); individualistic, hedonistic and\nsexually predatory, the discourses we identified fit James Brown's vision of\nLoaded as being 'for the man who believes he can do anything if only he wasn't\nhungover' (Loaded, 1994).  To date, 'new lad' has mostly been studied as a\nmedia construction.  This finding suggests the need for more empirical research\nto analyse the diffusion, uptake and resistance to this model of masculinity\namong young men.\nIn sum, the men in this study did regard their bodies as projects, charged with\nexpressing their identity and difference from everyone else, in a social and\nemotional landscape in which this was highly prized.  The look of the body was\nread as an indicator of a whole range of lifestyle and identity choices.  The\nabsence of any discourses other than individualism for talking about embodied\nidentity was a key finding of this research.  However, the men\u2019s bodies were also\nimplicated in another kind of project: that of regulating normative masculinity.\nDespite the emphasis on individual freedom and autonomy, the men rigourously\ndisciplined and policed their own and other men\u2019s bodies and identities\n23\nReferences\nBerger, J.
