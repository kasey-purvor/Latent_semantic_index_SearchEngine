The method is cost-effective and could be used to supplement information from \nanonymous error reporting schemes.\nBackground\nReplacing inpatient paper medication orders and medical\nnotes with electronic records is widely seen as the key\nstep to improve patient safety both in the United King-\ndom [1-3] and elsewhere [4]. Most UK hospital trusts are\nreported [1] to think that computerisation will reduce\nmedication errors by increasing control over prescribing.\nHowever, very few UK hospitals [5,6] have actually imple-\nmented hospital-wide electronic systems for ordering\nand recording administration of medicines (both defined\nas electronic prescribing in the UK). A similar, though\nslightly better, situation has been reported in Norway [7]\nwith implementation in most hospitals \"stalled\". In the\nUSA, widely perceived as leading the field in hospital\ncomputerised prescribing, less than 10% of hospitals are\nreported [8] to have electronic systems.\nThis is not really surprising as information and com-\nmunication technology systems are complex and costly\ninterventions. Committing to a particular system\nrequires belief in the evidence that it will be better than\ncurrent practice, and that potential problems can be\nmanaged [9]. Such evidence usually comes from evalua-\ntion studies.\nThe majority of research studies testing the effect of\ninterventions on medication prescribing error rates have\nused prospective process (observational error counting)\nor outcome (harm recording) methods [10].

For medication errors [12-14] the advantage of\nprospective methodology is that it allows some or all of\nthe data collection to be done as part of a pharmacist's\nnormal prescription (order) monitoring duties, so reduc-\ning research staff workload and cost. The drawback is\nthat if- as frequently happens- an evaluation is commis-\nsioned quite close to the time of implementation, it may\nnot be possible for the evaluators to obtain access to the\nsite before the intervention is put in place. In such cases,\nthe only option is to gather pre-intervention data retro-\nspectively, an approach which has been little used in the\nUK [10,15].\nTo date, retrospective eP evaluations have involved car-\nrying out a structured clinical review of a sample of\npatient medical records to identify, classify and count dif-\nferent types of medication errors. However, the people\nproviding or receiving hospital care also offer a rich\nsource of data on the day-to-day workings of a newly\nimplemented eP system. Interviews with stakeholders\nhave already been used to understand the ways such a\nsystem can be introduced into, and become part of, hos-\npital practice [15,16].\nThe aim of this study is to compare the post-eP error\npictures provided by retrospective record review and by\ninterviews with staff and patients within one hospital,\nand to consider the usefulness of interviews as an evalua-\ntion method.\nMethods\nThis retrospective evaluation was approved by the South\nEast Staffordshire local research ethics committee\n(LREC) and conducted at Queen's Hospital Burton upon\nTrent [QHB]. This district general hospital was an early\nadopter of eP and has a long-established system [15]\noperating as part of a Meditech hospital-wide informa-\ntion system (HIS) and linked to all other electronic\npatient and laboratory data. Traditional paper medical\nnotes were maintained but all other records were made\nand stored electronically. Wireless laptops and static ter-\nminals allowed access from almost anywhere in the hos-\npital site. Senior staff could also access the system from\nhome.\nAll authorised staff had access to patient care records;\npharmacists used the system to carry out daily prescrip-\ntion review of their allotted patients. System entry was via\npersonal identification number (PIN) and password,\nissued after mandatory in-house training. All activities\nwere fully auditable.\nQHB had a clear policy on eP decision support: the pre-\nscriber remained responsible for the decision and hence\nmost of the support was ensuring that drugs prescribed\nwere on the hospital formulary, in doses and formulations\nthat could be supplied. The eP system had been cust-\nomised to give prescriber \"red box\" warnings only for\nclinically significant drug-drug interactions, as defined in\nthe British National Formulary. These could be over-rid-\nden if the prescriber wished, Default doses, dosing fre-\nquencies and maximum dose warnings were only set for\nspecific drugs when the consensus was that these would\nbe useful. Drug-allergy and drug-laboratory tests (eg:\nrenal function; INR) checks were not activated.\nImplementation began in late 1996 and by 2002, elec-\ntronic prescribing and administration of medications was\nthe norm on all NHS wards, with paper charts reserved\nfor drugs with highly variable regimens (eg: insulin).\nOur data collection began approximately two years\nafter eP rollout was complete. Initial contact with the\nhospital was made through the head of pharmacy ser-\nvices who then provided information about the study to\npotential participants. Verbal informed consent was\nobtained and documented for all interviewees; patients\nwere also given an information leaflet. The LREC did not\nrequire patient consent for the retrospective record\nreview.\nRecord review data\nPatients were sampled from three wards (general medi-\ncine; general surgery; paediatrics) which had different\nversions of the Meditech software introduced at different\ntimes between 1999 and 2002. For each ward, data were\ncollected for 25 randomly selected patients admitted in\nthe calendar month six months before implementation of\neP and for 25 patients admitted in the calendar month six\nmonths afterwards. Only post-eP data will be presented\nin this paper. Patients were identified from the HIS and\nall electronic and paper records retrieved.\nOne research pharmacist carried out a structured\nreview of all medication orders and laboratory tests for\neach patient throughout his or her stay on the ward. The\ntotal number of medication orders written was also\nrecorded. An electronic retrospective review form (RRF)\nadapted from that used in the first UK study of iatrogenic\ninjury [17] was used to capture data for each patient\nreviewed, and to classify errors according to published\ncriteria [18]. A short text description providing informa-\ntion on the drug, dose and clinical situation was recorded\nfor each error identified.\nInterview data\nPharmacy staff and the majority of senior clinicians were\nidentified and approached by a senior hospital manager.\nOther clinical and ward staff were recruited by senior\npharmacists responsible for the relevant wards or identi-\nfied by the research team during interviews and depart-\nment visits. A staff announcement was also put out on\nthe HIS.\nSavage et al. BMC Health Services Research 2010, 10:135\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/10\/135\nPage 3 of 8Twenty-six staff (8 doctors, 6 nurses, 8 pharmacists\/\ntechnicians and 4 others) at senior, middle and junior\ngrades, and 19 adult in-patients were interviewed. All\nstaff participants used the HIS as part of their work. The\nmajority of interviews were tape-recorded. If recording\nwas not feasible (because of the setting), written notes\nwere made.\nThe interview topic guide [15] was developed from ini-\ntial interviews with four members of the implementation\nteam and three users (prescribers). There were no direct\nquestions about medication errors. All staff interviews\nexplored stakeholder views of key benefits and problems,\nand influences on working practices. Questions were tai-\nlored to the respondent's professional group.\nAdult patients were recruited from all general surgery\nand acute medicine wards in the hospital, including the\ntwo wards used in the record review. Recruiting children\nwas not attempted. Nineteen men and women aged 26 to\nover 70 took part. Sampling was purposive, based on use\nof \"as required\" medication and previous admission his-\ntory. Using Meditech, a senior pharmacist generated a\npaper listing of eligible patients for each ward. The\nresearchers then checked with the ward sister to deter-\nmine if patients were available, and well enough to be\napproached. Interviews were shorter than for staff and\nfocused on the system for prescribing and administering\nmedicines on the ward [15]. We asked specific questions\nabout missed or refused doses, access to medicines out-\nside normal drug round times, and discharge medication.\nData analysis\nThe text descriptions of errors found in the retrospective\nrecord review were entered into the database by the\nresearch pharmacist and reviewed by BDF.\nInterview data were collected and analysed by TC, EK,\nIS and SC. Transcripts and notes were read indepen-\ndently, then emerging themes discussed and agreed.\nInterview transcripts were then searched systematically\nfor accounts of medication incidents, both actual and\nhypothetical. A classification scheme based on the stage\nof the medicine use process was developed through itera-\ntive review of individual reports [19] and then applied to\nthe text descriptions of errors identified in the records\nreview.\nThe manpower required to collect data for each\napproach was estimated from staff diaries at the end of\nthe study.\nResults\nThe record review database included 85 individual\ndescriptions of prescribing and administration errors,\nThree of these (one drug-drug interaction and two fail-\nures to adjust dose in renal impairment) resulted in harm\n[15].\nSeventeen of the 26 staff interviews contained 69\naccounts of possible medication errors. One of these\naccounts concerned fluid overload with intravenous ther-\napy and had serious consequences. Three of the 19\npatient interviews also contained error accounts. Nine\nstaff did not describe possible medication errors. Four of\nthem had no direct involvement with medication, three\nwere nurses, and two were senior members of the original\nimplementation team.\nFigure 1 shows the classification scheme developed\nfrom the staff interviews. Table 1 presents the types of\nerror described by different respondent groups. Table 2\ncompares the types of error identified using interviews\nand with record review.\nDetails of specific errors identified are set out below,\nordered under the headings used in Figure 1. This scheme\nfollows the drug use process from the decision to pre-\nscribe through to administering, recording and monitor-\ning the effects of medication, and reflects the way that\nsubjects \"talked through the screens\" as they explained\nhow they used the eP system.\neP interface errors\nAt QHB, the vast majority of clinical information was\navailable electronically through the HIS. Outside the hos-\npital, the situation was different. Patients admitted to and\ndischarged from wards using eP therefore moved across\nan interface between a mostly paper-free and mostly\npaper-based world. As they moved, errors could occur.\nOne staff interview described a case where medicines\nhad been omitted from a patient's prescription on admis-\nsion. The patient had been in hospital for two months\nbefore she told the pharmacist that she normally used\neye-drops at home. A patient recounted a similar inci-\ndent. In another interview, a junior doctor spoke of a dia-\nbetic patient who had been discharged to a care home\nwith no insulin because the prescriber had not put a note\non the eP system to prescribe this on discharge. Record\nreview found three cases where medication (salbutamol,\namitriptyline, insulin) had not been continued as\nexpected when the patient moved between health care\nsectors. This could happen because medication required\nfor discharge had to be flagged on the system by the pre-\nscriber, then \"converted\" from inpatient orders in the\npharmacy before dispensing.\nErrors at the prescribing stage\nClinical need\nRecord review provided a wide range of examples where\nthe need for treatment, review or investigation had not\nbeen met. Cases included antibiotic therapy for methicil-\nlin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus not being prescribed;\nlack of potassium supplementation in a hypokalaemic\nasthmatic; not reviewing fluoxetine treatment when\nSavage et al.

Interviews provided only two examples: neglect-\ning to prescribe antibiotics for a patient with heart valve\ndisease and an account from a patient who reported not\nbeing able to get the hospital doctors to prescribe her\nusual migraine medication.\nPatient selection\nA pharmacy interview described a case where medicines\nhad been prescribed for the wrong patient because of a\nscrolling error on the patient selection screen. Junior doc-\ntors also described near-misses, and said that this error\ncould happen \"because you are not going to the bedside\".\nNo cases of prescribing to the wrong patient were\ndetected in the record review\nDrug choice\nBoth methods identified knowledge-based errors. In\nrecord reviews these included potentially clinically signif-\nicant drug interactions involving aminophylline and phe-\nnytoin; use of digoxin and acitretin in renal impairment;\nand prescribing a penicillin to a patient recorded as possi-\nbly allergic. Interviews with doctors mentioned lack of\npenicillin allergy warnings, and also prescribing a non-\nsteroidal analgesic drug which was \"hidden\" in a post-\noperative \"order set\" to an asthmatic patient. However\nthere were no accounts of drug-drug interactions.\nMenu picking\nThe eP prescribing (order entry) screen had \"look-up\"\nfunctions for drug names, doses and routes, and links to\ndrug monographs and local guidelines and policies.

However, pharmacy staff describing cases\nwhere doctors had ordered the next drug on the lookup\nmenu considered it very unlikely that this would have\nhappened if the prescription had been hand-written as\nthe drugs (methotrexate instead of methotrimeprazine;\nethamsylate instead of ethambutol) were so very differ-\nent.\nDrug\/dose duplication\nBoth methods identified unintentional drug duplication\n(eg: prescribing paracetamol, and a paracetamol-contain-\ning combination product) and dose duplication, where a\ndrug (eg: an analgesic or anti-emetic) was prescribed\norally and by other routes to allow nurses flexibility\ndepending on the patient condition but the maximum\ndaily dose for the drug was not specified.\nDose, form and frequency\nWrong doses, product strengths and dosing frequencies\nwere identified in both interviews and notes review.\nHowever interviews primarily cited warfarin and special-\nist paediatric drugs while errors identified in reviews\ninvolved different paediatric and anticoagulant drugs,\nplus anti-epileptics. Dose frequency errors often involved\nthe lack of a daily limit on \"as required\" analgesics and\nanti-emetics, reflecting the inflexibility of eP for this type\nof drug order. Interviews generated two examples of pos-\nsible dosing frequency errors: a once-weekly drug pre-\nscribed once a day, and drugs for Parkinson's disease.\nFormulation selection errors mainly involved enteric\ncoated products.\nSupply and administration errors\nNew orders for drugs not carried as ward stock were\npicked up by the pharmacy system. Review of administra-\ntion records identified several regular drugs (including\nantibiotics and anti-epileptics) which had not been given\nbecause no supply was available on the ward. One phar-\nmacy technician described how an incorrect strength of\nan unidentified drug had been issued as \"ward stock\". The\nerror had been detected by a nurse during a drug round.\nThere were no accounts of scrolling errors when nurses\nselected patient names from the screen during drug\nrounds.\nDose omission\nThe patient drug administration screen listed all regular\nmedication before as required and once-only orders. In\ninterviews, junior doctors and nurses mentioned that\nurgent once-only orders (eg intravenous furosemide) and\nsome as-required medicines were not given because they\n\"fell off the screen\" ie could not be seen without \"paging\ndown\". One patient complained that her once-only dose\nof an IV antibiotic was several hours overdue. Record\nreview did not identify any errors of this type. We also\nfound some patients who didn't know that they had been\nprescribed as-required drugs that they could have asked\nfor if needed. Retrospective record review could not iden-\ntify errors with this type of drug order as it was impossi-\nble to know if need had in fact existed.\nScheduling of doses was done at the point of prescrib-\ning. Regular medicines were allocated times correspond-\ning to ward drug rounds, with a 2-hour window to allow\nfor variation. Junior doctors and nurses described how\ndefault timings in the eP dose scheduling system could\ndelay the start of a new regular medication. Pharmacists\nand doctors also described difficulties with flexibly dosed\ndrugs such as warfarin and insulin, which required paper\nrecords.\nRecording and monitoring errors\neP recording\nThe risk of dose duplication when eP records were not\navailable was identified in both interviews and record\nreview. Nurse and doctor interviews described being\nunsure, when the system was down, if a patient asking for\nanalgesia had recently received a dose. There was also a\nreport that analgesic doses given in theatre (which did\nnot use eP) might be repeated on the ward. Record review\nfound cases where analgesics and propranolol had been\nprescribed as regular drugs, but no administration\nrecords had been made so it was not clear whether or not\nthey had been given.\nTwo interviews described cases where medication (top-\nicals and IV fluids) had been given but had not been pre-\nscribed on the system and so an eP administration record\ncould not be made. Record review identified several cases\nwhere oxygen had been given but not prescribed.\nMonitoring\nRecord review identified errors involving lack of renal\nfunction monitoring for patients prescribed digoxin, and\nlack of aminophylline and phenytoin plasma level mea-\nsurement for patients co-prescribed clarithromycin.\nInterviews generated possible incidents where warfarin\nand gentamicin doses had not been adjusted on the basis\nof test results (eg with warfarin, gentamicin, sliding scale\ninsulin), or where physiological monitoring had not been\ndone (intravenous fluids)\nResearch resources comparison\nFrom initial scoping visit to final interview, collecting\ndata for this study took 14 months. Record review: On\naverage, only four patients could be reviewed each day.\nDespite most records being electronic, retrieving patient\ninformation was not particularly quick as there were\nproblems accessing the optical disk archive at busy times.\nReviewing 75 patients took approximately 20 researcher-\ndays.\nSavage et al. BMC Health Services Research 2010, 10:135\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/10\/135\nPage 7 of 8Interviews\nThe 26 staff interviews took approximately 11 researcher-\ndays, with the majority (19) conducted by three research-\ners over three consecutive days. Patients were recruited\nand interviewed by two researchers over a second three-\nday period.\nBoth record review and interview datasets required fur-\nther work after collection. Unfortunately diary informa-\ntion was not available for all researchers involved so we\nwere unable to make a comparison.\nDiscussion\nOur classification of the prescribing process is an over-\nsimplification, developed from the way the staff partici-\npants described how they worked. The actual prescribing\nprocess is probably much less linear as each step may\nneed to draw on knowledge of previous events (medi-\ncines, diagnoses, tests, observations) recorded in patients'\ncharts and notes. The interview sample size was method-\nologically adequate [19] but the relatively small number\nof records reviewed was a pragmatic choice, based on\nprevious experience [15]. By its nature, record review is\nmore likely to identify errors of omission than an inter-\nview.\nDespite these limitations, record review and interviews\nproduced similar pictures of medication errors, although\ninterviewees often described hypothetical incidents with-\nout mentioning the specific drugs involved. The three\ndrugs they mentioned most often were warfarin, insulin\nand intravenous fluids. This is probably because these\nvariable dose medicines were less straightforward to pre-\nscribe, with or without eP.\nIn interviews, the types of incident described reflected\nthe respondent's role. Junior doctors (who do most of the\nprescribing) and pharmacy staff (who supply the drugs\nand review most of the orders) described the widest\nrange of incidents. Nurses focused on drug administra-\ntion and were generally cautious in their responses. All\nthree professional groups had been involved in system\ndevelopment, but nurses were clearly the most concerned\nabout personal accountability [20,21]. Some patients were\nalso concerned about sounding negative, despite assur-\nances that what they told the interviewer would not affect\ntheir future care.\nThe majority of incidents described by staff were close\nanalogies of those that also happen with paper charts. In\ninterviews the inability to \"see the whole picture\" on the\nscreen appeared to be mainly a problem for those rela-\ntively new to the system, but much less of a problem than\nin the recent USA study [8].\nThe general view is that eP will reduce errors but new\ntechnology can also introduce new types of error\n[8,13,22]. Two of the three serious post-eP errors\ndescribed by Shulman et al [22] were \"menu picking\"\nerrors. Our retrospective review did not detect these eP-\nspecific errors but, significantly, our interview data did. It\nalso provided rich detail on the technical work [23] of\nprescribing and administering drugs on the wards.\nRobust evaluations are vital tools for persuading users\nto adopt new technologies, but prospective before-after\ndata collection can take 18 months. This time may not be\navailable, particularly if the evaluation is commissioned\naround the time of implementation. This can weaken the\nimpact of the findings. The evaluation report [24] of the\nthree pilot sites for the proposed NHS Electronic Health\nRecord (EHR) noted that the study was \"seriously ham-\npered\" by the failure to build in evaluation before the\nEHR project started.\nThe retrospective record review reported here was\nquicker than the prospective evaluation we did at a differ-\nent site [12] but record data collection took more\nresearcher-days than interview data. Interviews tailored\nto address policy-makers' questions could therefore offer\ngood research value particularly if the study site is remote\nfrom the research contractors' usual workplace.\nEvaluation increases our understanding of the influence\nof technologies on working practices and patient out-\ncomes, including occurrences of medication errors, but\nqualitative data on staff perception of errors has been\nclaimed to provide weaker evidence than counts of actual\nerrors [25]. Counts provide error frequencies which are\ngood for efficacy testing but we suggest that counting is\nnot the only way. We need to explore how people change\nand are changed by systems [7] and use beliefs about\nerrors [8] to maintain and develop safe and effective\nhealthcare working practices.\nFor example, pharmacists using eP may believe that\nready access to a wide variety of computerised results\nimproves their ability to trap prescribing errors, but it\nmay also reduce face-to-face contact with staff and\npatients because they no longer need to visit the wards to\nget the clinical information they need for effective pre-\nscription review. This change in practice could have a sig-\nnificant effect on inter-professional communication; it\nmight also change the pattern of errors that pharmacists\nmiss.\nConclusions\nMedication error is a sensitive subject, and people may\nhave concerns about reporting actual errors. In our staff\ninterviews, talking about the perceived benefits and\ndrawbacks of their hospital eP system generated many\naccounts of specific errors which \"could\" or \"might\" hap-\npen, as well as descriptions of near misses which had\nbeen made by other people.\nImportantly, these interviews identified the same types\nof medication errors as did the more resource-intensive\nrecord review method. This method therefore offers not\nSavage et al.
