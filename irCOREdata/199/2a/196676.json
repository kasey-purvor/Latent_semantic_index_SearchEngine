We report that inactivation of MMR genes (MLH1, MLH2, MSH2, MSH3, MSH6, but not PMS1) in isogenic strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae led to increased resistance to the anticancer drugs cisplatin, carboplatin and doxorubicin, but had no effect on sensitivity to ultraviolet C (UVC) radiation. Sensitivity to cisplatin and doxorubicin was increased in mlh1 mutant strains when the MLH1 gene was reintroduced, demonstrating a direct involvement of MMR proteins in sensitivity to these DNA-damaging agents. Inactivation of MLH1, MLH2 or MSH2 had no significant effect, however, on drug sensitivities in the rad52 or rad1 mutant strains that are defective in mitotic recombination and removing unpaired DNA single strands. We propose a model whereby MMR proteins  in addition to their role in DNA-damage recognition  decrease adduct tolerance during DNA replication by modulating the levels of recombination-dependent bypass.
