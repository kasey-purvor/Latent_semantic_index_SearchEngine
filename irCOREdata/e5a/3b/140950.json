The results shows differences in airlines\u2019 strategies such as aircraft type used,\nload factors and seat configurations.\nKeywords: Environment, carbon calculator methodology, business travel, airline\nbusiness models.\nIntroduction\nBusiness related travel accounts for around 40% of all air trips (Doganis, 2002,). While\nthe very rapid growth of leisure travel on mainly low cost carriers has reduced the\nproportion of business travel for European short haul travel, business travel is still\ngrowing at around 5% a year (Mason and Alamdari, 2007). As corporate social\nresponsibility (CSR), and the environmental impact of businesses on local communities\nand globally has risen up corporate executive agendas, companies are increasingly\nlooking for ways in which to lighten their businesses carbon emissions levels.\nMoreover, companies that can demonstrate to their clients that they minimise and\nmitigate their environmental impact may benefit from competitive advantage over their\ncompetitors. For many companies, business related air travel is a significant contributor\nto their carbon footprints and thus one way to reduce carbon emissions is to look to\nbetter manage their use of air travel. To do this, companies need to be able to assess the\nenvironmental performance of individual airlines and different airline business models\nto be able to make better-informed choices in their purchasing and procurement\nprocesses. Current carbon calculators as proposed by UK government\u2019s Department of\nthe Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) based on a simplistic model\nsuggested by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) does not provide a\nmeans by which customers can compare airline suppliers on environmental\n\uf02a corresponding author: k.mason@cranfield.ac.uk\n2 of 26\nperformance. This paper aims to demonstrate the potential of a prototype methodology\nfor carbon calculation that enables such assessment and highlight some key\nenvironmental performance differences between carriers whereas they would be\nmeasured as identical using the DEFRA-type measurement approach.\nSome studies suggest that somewhere in the region of 10% - 20% of business travel\nmay be in some way escapable by either replacing the travel with alternative forms of\ncommunication or by simply stopping unnecessary travel (Coddington, 1993, Feldman,\n1993, Arnfalk and Kogg, 2003 and Cairns et al., 2004). If this 20% saving in business\nrelated air travel can be accessed and reductions achieved then this will lead to a\nsignificant fall in carbon emissions as airlines alter schedules and networks accordingly.\nTo do this will require both levers \/ drivers for change in current business travel\nbehaviour and systems to enable change in behaviour.\nWhile for some companies (e.g. manufacturing sector companies), travel may represent\nonly a small part of their carbon footprint, for consultancies, banks, and other service\nindustry companies, travel may account for as much as half of the company\u2019s carbon\nemissions.For example, around 40% of HSBCs carbon emissions are travel related, and\nwhen in 2004 the CEO of the bank announced it would become carbon neutral, the\ntravel manager\u2019s role expanded to work out ways to reduce the bank\u2019s travel related\ncarbon footprint (BBC News, 2004).\n.\nA prototype for an advanced carbon calculation methodology for air travel\nOne of the key limitations to airline carbon calculators currently in the market is they\nrarely distinguish between individual airline performances. By demonstrating it is\npossible to develop a system to distinguish between airlines on environmental\nperformance, companies may be able to select preferred airline suppliers based on their\nenvironmental performance.\nReview of existing methodologies for carbon emissions\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (1997) provides a two-tired\nmethodology in the \u201cGreenhouse Gas Inventory Reference Manual\u201d as a framework for\nestimating and reporting the emissions from aviation. The first tier is the simplest\nmethodology, based only an aggregate number for fuel consumption to be multiplied\nwith average emission factors. The second \u201cTier 2\u201d methodology estimates emissions in\ntwo flying phases; the Landing and Take Off (LTO), and cruise phases. Fuel burn is\nhigher in the LTO phase than cruise phase as the aircraft engines are working harder. As\nthe aircraft reaches full cruise altitude the engines can work less hard and also less fuel\nis burnt at higher altitudes due to the thinner atmosphere. In the \u201cTier 2\u201d approach,\nemissions for these two phases are calculated separately and are then aggregated.\n3 of 26\nEmissions for a flight depends on the type of aircraft, type of engines, altitude and\ndistance flown. DEFRA studied average emission level of air transport and presented\nemission factors for domestic and international flights on several routes using default\naverage factors for CO2 emissions and average flight distances and load factors (see\nTable 1).\nTABLE 1 ABOUT HERE\nIn a similar study, Table 2 shows examples of emission levels for three flights and the\nassumptions used by CE Delft (2005 and 2007). CE Delft used fuel consumption data\ntaken from the CORINAIR Emission Inventory Guidebook (as did DEFRA).\nComparing the two tables, differences can be attributed to aircraft selection, stage length\nand load factors. Other results of carbon emissions levels estimated in a number of other\nare described in Table 3.\nTABLE 2 ABOUT HERE\nTABLE 3 ABOUT HERE\nThe results of the studies which assessed the emissions levels are calculated mainly\nbased on three categorised markets; short haul, medium range and long haul routes,\nusing assumptions and average or aggregated data (Intergovernmental Panel on\nClimate Change, 1998; Jardine, 2005; CE Delft, 2005 and 2007; Department for\nEnvironment, Food and Rural Affairs, 2005 and 2007). These factors are, in practice,\nvery different between airlines and routes (Faber et al, 2007) according to the fuel\nefficiency of the aircraft used and operational performances. The review highlighted the\nfollowing:\n1. There is little measure consistency between the carbon calculators currently\navailable\u2013 i.e. the same journey would be measured at different levels of carbon\nemissions by different calculators\n2. Different calculators adopt different methodologies\n3. Most available calculators do not allow travel managers to evaluate supplier\nenvironmental performance as most calculators tend to treat all airlines as\nhaving the same performance for similar routes.\n4. Many carbon calculators provided by suppliers (such as airlines) estimate the\ncarbon emissions level by the number of passengers on the sector based on the\ndesired load factors (such as 88% as used by one airline) or assuming 100% load\nfactors and using very high efficient fuel consumption factors.\n4 of 26\nA Methodology for an Advanced Carbon Calculator\nTo develop a calculator that more accurately reflects actual air transport activity, a\ndisaggregated (bottom-up) approach was adopted. It aims to demonstrate current\nemissions levels in the air transport market by estimating and analysing the carbon\nemissions by route, stage length, aircraft type used, number of seats supplied on each\naircraft and the distance flown on each route. Fundamentally, this approach follows the\nacknowledged methodologies based on revised 1996 IPCC \u201cGuidelines for National\nGreenhouse Gas Inventories: Reference Manual and Emission Inventories\u201d (EEA, 2006)\nfor estimating emissions.\nFIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE\nAircraft type, cruise altitude and sector distance are used to calculate the fuel\ncomsumption and therefore emissions during the LTO cycle and cruising stage on each\nroute. An aircraft\u2019s fuel burn on a route is not linear with distance and an aircraft burns\na relatively large amount of fuel in the initial climb and a lower account of fuel while\nflying typical descent schedules. Emissions during the LTO cycle, by aircraft type, are\nobtained from the IPCC guidelines (1997) and the Emission Inventory Guidebook\n(EEA, 2006). Subsequently fuel consumptions during cruise stage are calculated using\nperformance tables from Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) Revision 3.4 and 3.61. These\ncalculations are also based on the most frequently used cruise altitude for each route. On\nshorter sectors lower cruise altitudes are generally used and here the fuel efficiency of\nthe aircraft is less than if a higher altitude is used. To allow for the climb from leaving\nexiting the Take-off phase (at 3,000ft) to the operated cruise altitude (perhaps 30,000ft),\nthe model adds 10 \u2013 15 mins to the cruise time depending on the length of the sector\nand ultimate cruise altitude.\nTraffic data for 2006 (1,626 routes and 59 aircraft types) on the UK domestic routes and\nthe intra-EU routes serving UK airports was obtained by the UK Civil Aviation\nAuthority.The great circle distance is used for sector distances following NASA\u2019s\nmethodology (1994), however such an approach does not allow for air traffic\nmanagement inefficiencies which can add between around 10% to flight times due to\ncircuitous routings and \/ or local traffic delays leading to time spent in holding patterns.\nSuch inefficiencies are recognised but were considered mainly beyond the control of the\nairlines2 and therefore beyond the scope of this research. For the North Atlantic study, a\n1 It was issued in September 2004 European Organisation for the safety of air navigation (BADA 3.6 Performance\nSummary Tables). The BADA database do not include many smaller aircraft type and therefore to miniise the use of\n\u201caverage\u201d or \u201cexemplar\u201d aircraft in place of real aircraft, EEA data were used for the aircraft missing from the BADA\ndataset.\n2 Although the authors recognise that some indirect flight paths are adopted by airlines to attract lower en-route air\ntraffic charges.\n5 of 26\nslightly different methodology was undertaken and Association of European Airlines\n(AEA) data for 2004 was used.\nEmissions by aircraft type\nFigure 2 shows emission levels, across a range of sector lengths for different aircraft.\nThese are calculated based on the assumptions of typical seat configurations (the\nnumber of seats supplied) and 75% load factor. In practice, the results of these\ncalculations will vary based on the actual number of seat configured in an aircraft and\nactual load factors airlines achieved.\nThe figure shows that carbon emissions per passenger kilometre is high on short sectors,\nas the fuel burn during the LTO cycle becomes a relatively more significant part of the\nfuel burn of the entire flight. For larger aircraft on medium and long-haul flights, the\nLTO cycle is less significant, because the cruising stage forms the major part of fuel\nburn. Note there is a slight decrease in flight efficiency with increased distance, due to\nthe greater fuel load that must be carried. The figure highlights the differences between\ntwo-engined aircraft and four-engined aircraft like B-777 and B-747. Newly developed\naircraft such as B-737-700 and B-777, produce lower emissions than older generation\naircraft type.\nFIGURE 2 ABOUT HERE\nThe UK Domestic market\nFigure 3 contrasts the CO2 emissions differences between airlines, and compares carbon\nemissions (g)\/pkm by airline in the UK domestic market. While, turboprop aircraft\ngenerally have lower emissions per flight than jet aircraft, the emissions levels (on a per\npassenger kilometre basis: g\/pkm) of airlines, which are operating aircraft such as ATR\n42 and BAE 146, are relatively high while those of airlines, which are operating B737\nseries and A320 families, are relatively low. This is, in part, because the average load\nfactors of the latter airlines are comparatively higher and are operate on relatively\nlonger domestic sectors (450-550kms).\nFIGURE 3 ABOUT HERE\n6 of 26\nWhen total emissions by airline correlates to the scale of airline\u2019s business in the UK\ndomestic market. In particular, the top two airlines produce over 42 % of the emissions\nin 2006 and 94% was shared out by the top 12 airlines in the UK domestic market (see\nFigure 4).\nFIGURE 4 ABOUT HERE\nMore than half of emissions for domestic UK air services are created on routes from \/ to\nLondon with the trunk routes to Glasgow and Edinburgh the largest two routes.\nFIGURE 5 ABOUT HERE\nFigure 6 depicts the top 20 routes in terms of seats supplied and the annual carbon\nemissions (in 2006). Load factors achieved vary dramatically from 57% to 81%, and\nthis has a significant impact on the emissions per seat with higher load factors reducing\nthe emissions per passenger carried as can be seen in Figure 7.\nFIGURE 6 ABOUT HERE\n7 of 26\nThe average distance flown of the top 20 routes is 581kms with 78% average load factor\nand an average of 162g carbon emissions per passenger kilometre. On the routes\noperated by low cost carriers such as Edinburgh-London Gatwick and the Glasgow\nPrestwick-London Stansted, the per passenger carbon emissions are relatively low due\nto high seat density and high load factors achieved compared to the routes, where\nnetwork carriers predominate. The impact of low cost carriers in the EU short haul\nmarket has been remarkable, drawing considerable market share from incumbent\nnetwork and regional carriers. The passenger numbers have also risen dramatically.\nLow cost carriers tend to operate new fuel-efficient aircraft, have high seating density\nand report exceedingly high load factors. Together this means passengers on low cost\ncarriers tend to have relatively low carbon emissions on a grams per passenger\nkilometre basis compared with passengers on network or regional carriers. However, if\na significant proportion of their passengers have been stimulated to travel by their low\nfares then their environmental impact of these carriers could be considered to be\ndamaging. This LCC environmental paradox depends on whether passengers using their\nservices are newly generated or traffic stimulated by low fares. The European Low\nFares Airlines Association (2004) indicated that 60% of their members traffic was\ngenerated by low fares, however the UK Civil Aviation Authority (2006) found the\nreverse suggesting that the low cost carriers had taken market share from other carriers\nbut the growth in the market did not include newly generated traffic once natural growth\nin the market has been included.\nFIGURE 7 ABOUT HERE\nIntra-EU serving UK airports routes\nIn this section, the intra-EU routes serving UK (excluding the UK domestic market) are\nanalysed using UK CAA data for 2006. This market covers the sector lengths varying\nwidely from the short haul sectors like the Jersey-Cherbourg route (79kms) to medium\nhaul sectors as the London Heathrow-Larnaka in Cyprus (3,600kms) Figure 83 shows\nthe average carbon emissions per sector on the intra-EU routes in 2006.\nFIGURE 8 ABOUT HERE\nThe emissions levels per sector can be segmented into groups based on the type of\nairline operations: network carriers from outside EU and EEA countries, charter\nairlines, network carriers in EU, low cost carriers and regional airlines. Figure 8\ndemonstrates that the long-range sectors produce more emissions per flight rather than\nshort sectors and illustrates the differences between airlines and aircraft type they used.\n3 The allocation of emissions to cargo carried has been excluded in this analysis. However, further development of\nthe prototype carbon calculator should be extended to include it.\n8 of 26\nNetwork carriers from outside EU and EEA countries operate aircraft type for the long\nrange flights on this market as part of the international fifth freedom operation, e.g.\nLondon Heathrow-Paris Charles de Gaulle by Air China or American Airlines. On these\nsectors the carbon emissions (g)\/pkm are very high as a result of very low load factors\non the relatively large aircraft. When looking at the same figures on a per passenger\nkilometre basis (Figure 9), the airlines plotted above the logarithmic line-of-best-fit are\nmainly network carriers from outside the EU, while other airlines plotted below the line\nare mainly charter airlines, network carriers in EU, low cost carries and regional\nairlines. The figure suggests that the airlines that have the highest per passenger carbon\nfootprint are non-EU carriers operating routes under fifth freedom traffic rights.\nFIGURE 9 ABOUT HERE\n9 of 26\nThe differences of carbon emissions levels between airlines can in part to be understood\nclearly by comparing carbon emissions levels per passenger per sector incorporating\nload factors by airline. Average load factors of LCCs like Ryanair (78%) and easyJet\n(81%) and charter airlines such as Monarch Airlines (75%) and GB Airways (83%) are\ncomparatively high compared to those of e.g. CSA Czech Airlines (56%), Croatia\nAirlines (63%), Bulgaria Air (65%), and regional airlines as Flybe (65%), BA Connect\n(59%) and Luxair (54%).\nWhen carbon emissions levels are expressed per passenger kilometre flown, the\ndifferences between airlines are highlighted further. The carbon emissions (g)\/pkm of\nairlines which operate on short sectors with low load factor become higher (see Figure\n10).\nFIGURE 10 ABOUT HERE\nOn the other hand, the emissions produced by the three key players in this market are so\nsignificant that the effects of their business practices on the market are important (see\nFigure 11).\nFIGURE 11 ABOUT HERE\nThe intra-EU serving UK routes can be segmented into four groups according to the\nlevels of carbon emissions (g) per passenger kilometre (see Table 4).\nTABLE 4 ABOUT HERE\nGroup A represents airlines operating on routes where average carbon emissions\n(g)\/pkm is less than 100 g\/pkm, and Group B is where this figure is less than 150g\/pkm.\nGroups A and B form the majority of the intra-EU serving UK routes, accounting for\nmore than 71% of the number of passengers carried and 59% of the number of\ndepartures. The routes, of which average carbon emissions (g)\/pkm are between 150 and\n250, belong to Group C, while Group D consists of the routes, which produce carbon\nemissions over 250g\/pkm. Table 5 highlights the differences among these route groups\nby carbon emissions (g)\/pkm, average distance flown and load factors of each route\ngroup.\nTABLE 5 ABOUT HERE\nThe very low emissions market, Group A (with average carbon emissions: 87g\/pkm)\naccounts for 31% of demand and contribute only 23% of emission. Group B (with\naverage carbon emissions of 123g\/pkm) has 40% of demand and 42% of emissions.\nGroup C routes are largely operated by network carriers for their hub and spoke network\n10 of 26\nroutes accounting for 23% of the passengers, but 29% of the emissions. The high\nemissions Group D is mainly operated by regional carriers and although is only a small\ngroup carrying just 4% of traffic it accounts for 6% of emissions. The gaps between\npassengers carried and emissions contributions can be attributed mainly to aircraft used,\nstage length, load factors achieved, and cabin seating configuration. While the analysis\nhere has segmented all the operators on routes by their average passenger carbon\nemissions, it would also be worthwhile to undertake an analysis of emissions levels by\ndifferent airline business models (e.g. full service network, low cost, regional, charter,\netc.) This paper establishes an appropriate methodology to appraise the carbon\nfootprints of differing business models and is currently being used to undertake this\nfurther work being conducted for an Omega funded study to be available in 2009.\nNorth Atlantic Analysis\nLong distance international routes are analysed here by using the North Atlantic market\nas an example. Traffic data by airline, route and real load factors in both premium and\neconomy cabins, published by Association of European Airlines (AEA) in 2004 are\nused to estimate the number of carbon emissions by for each airline. Compared to\nprevious sections, a different calculation methodology was adopted for this market\nbecause of individual route data limitations.\nWhere airlines operate multiple cabins, as is the usual case in long haul flying, the\ncarbon emission estimates should reflect these different products. Carbon emission\nlevels by class may be analysed by considering the seat space which each passenger\noccupies, taking into to account the proportion of number of passengers in each class\ncompared to the number of passengers on the sector flight. Therefore, if a passenger in\nFirst Class occupies twice as much space as a passenger in Economy Class, then the\nFirst Class passenger\u2019s emissions estimate should be twice that of the Economy Class\npassenger. Spaces of other facilities like galleys, aisles, lavatories, and bar spaces are\nexcluded in this analysis. While this real-estate approach does not directly consider the\nweight of the passengers (or their luggage), the opportunity cost of carrying more\neconomy passengers instead of fewer business class passengers is considered to be an\nappropriate way to allocate emissions. However two economy passengers (plus\nbaggage) is heavier than one business class passenger. To try to estimate the weight of\npassengers by cabin for each airline, including the weight of the airline seats (business\nand first class seats are considerably more heavy than economy seats) that are\ndependent on a wide range of factors including in-flight entertainment systems, seat\nmanufacturers and materials used, was impossible due to data limitations.\nFigure 12 shows the result of the estimated carbon emissions (g\/pkm: grams per\npassenger kilometres) by airline on North Atlantic routes in 2004 (average distance\nflown: 6,825kms),. In this analysis emissions are centred between 100 and 150g\/pkm.\nSeveral airlines that use new generation aircraft (B777 and A340) and achieve high load\nfactors (over 88%) produce less than 100 g\/pkm. On the other hand, the emissions of\nairlines which operated older generation aircraft (B747-200) with relatively low load\nfactors (less than 75%) have very high emissions levels with one over 240g\/pkm.\n11 of 26\nFIGURE 12 HERE\nThese results are estimated based on the average number of passengers carried on the\nsectors. They are affected by load factors and capacities of each airline and capacities\nare affected by the existence of first class and the seat pitches of each class. They vary\ndepending on each airline\u2019s strategy; the average space occupied by passenger on one\nnetwork carrier\u2019s First Class (80 inches) and Business Class seat (61 inches) is 2.3 times\nlonger than that of its Economy Class seat (31 inches) when the differences in load\nfactor by cabin are accounted for. Another carrier\u2019s business class seat (60 inches) is 1.9\ntimes longer than that of economy class (32 inches).\nThe number of seats and load factors in the first and business class affect the result of\nthese calculations significantly. Carriers with very large business class cabins will have\nhigher emissions levels per passenger than those that carry a larger number of economy\npassengers in the same aircraft type.\nFigure 13 contrasts the differences of the results between the economy class and first\/\nbusiness class. For airlines that have both first class and business class, emissions level\nin those classes may be more than double of those of passengers in economy class. One\ncarrier\u2019s emission level for first\/business class is estimated at over 400g\/pkm because\nnot only was it operating B747-200 on a quarter of its long haul routes but also the\nnumber of passengers in both first and business class were very low. The figure also\nshows estimated emissions level for a business class-only-airlines (airlines \u201cS\u201d and \u201cT\u201d)\nas 255 to 337g\/pkm, based on operations in 2007 and 2008 which is higher than average\nof first\/business class (220g\/pkm) of other network carriers.\nFIGURE 13 ABOUT HERE\nThe results clearly demonstrate the differences among airlines, reflecting their\nstrategies. Fuel-efficient new generation aircraft, operating without a first class cabin,\nand operating at high load factors particularly in the business class are the factors to\nimprove the level of carbon emissions per passenger kms on the long haul routes. To\nunderstand the carbon foot print level on these sectors, it is important to consider these\nfactors.\nConclusions\nThe key areas for airlines to concentrate efforts to reduce carbon emissions per\npassenger kilometre are increasing load factor (particularly in First and Business Class\nin long haul operations), the operation of a fuel-efficient fleet of aircraft, and higher\ndensity cabin configurations.\nThe prototype developed demonstrates that it is possible to build an advanced carbon\ncalculator that uses actual data by airlines and routes for aircraft operated, cabin\nconfiguration used, cruise altitude used, and passenger load factors achieved.\n12 of 26\nThe availability of carbon emission levels by airline and route is a possibility and\ncorporate travel managers need this information to be able to make informed choices on\npreferred suppliers. Travellers that are charged with reducing their travel related carbon\nemissions need carbon emissions data by airline at Point-of-Sale to be able to select the\nmost efficient airline. This demand factor will lead airlines to seek methods to reduce\ntheir carbon emissions per passenger.\nAcknowledgements:\nThis work was funded by Omega (www.omega.mmu.ac.uk) and conducted by Cranfield\nUniversity in association with the Institute of Travel Management.
