INTRODUCTION\nFluid flows at high Reynolds numbers can be dominated\nby the dynamics and interactions of long-lived vortical\nstructures.1\u20134 The dynamics and stability of these vortices are\nparticularly important in areas of fluid dynamics such as\nmeteorology5,6 and magnetohydrodynamics.7 Many studies\nhave considered the behavior of an axisymmetric vortex sub-\njected to a transient, nonaxisymmetric strain. If this strain is\nweak then in the early stages the vortex may evolve dynami-\ncally into an axisymmetric state; any nonaxisymmetric com-\nponents of the vorticity become finely scaled through spiral\nwind-up in the underlying flow field.8 During this process,\nthe far-field form of the stream function decays exponentially\nin time and rotates with a fixed angular velocity which is fast\ncompared to the decay rate. This behavior of the vortex is\ntermed a quasimode9\u201311 and has been observed both in\nplasma experiments10 \u0001where the governing equations are\nisomorphic to the Euler equations\u0002 and in numerical\nstudies.12\nPut simply, a quasimode is essentially a wave located in\nthe core of a vortex and, while it appears to be a single mode,\nit can more accurately be characterized as a wave-packet of\ncontinuum modes. The quasimode is a solution of the linear-\nized Euler equations that is not separable in time, and decays\non a much longer time-scale than the turn-over time-scale of\nthe underlying vortex. Quasimodes of an axisymmetric cir-\ncular vortex have been studied analytically via Laplace trans-\nforms of the linearized Euler equation;9,10,13 an attraction of\nthis method is that the angular velocity and the decay rate of\nthe disturbance stream function can be deduced from the real\nand imaginary parts of a simple pole of the governing sys-\ntem. The location of this pole, known as a Landau pole, can\nbe calculated by analytic continuation techniques9 and it fol-\nlows that the decay rate and angular velocity of the quasi-\nmode depend only on the form of the axisymmetric base\nprofile of the vortex. Moreover, the decay rate of the quasi-\nmode is very sensitive to the gradient of the axisymmetric\nbase profile at the critical radius where the angular velocity\nof the quasimode equals that of the vortex.11\nAn illustration of an azimuthal wave number n=2 dis-\nturbance to a Gaussian vortex is shown in Fig. 1. At the\nearlier time \u0003Fig. 1\u0001a\u0002\u0004 there is a linear combination of a\nspiral structure in which vorticity depends on r and \u0001, and a\nmode in which the sign of the vorticity depends just on \u0001:\nthis is the quasimode, and corresponds to an elliptical distor-\ntion of the whole vortex that rotates \u0001much like a Kelvin\nmode on a top-hat vortex\u0002 and decays because of interaction\nwith spiral wind-up of fluctuations at the critical radius\nwhere the fluid corotates with the mode. At the later time\n\u0003Fig. 1\u0001b\u0002\u0004 the quasimode has decayed to low levels, leaving\nbehind the spiral structure, in which vorticity is of fine scale\nand essentially passive.\nWhen an axisymmetric vortex is placed within a suffi-\nciently strong irrotational strain field, it is well known that\nthe vorticity can evolve into a tripole in which a pair of cat\u2019s\neyes rotate around a coherent vortex core.10,11,14,15 The vor-\nticity within the cat\u2019s eyes becomes wound up and homog-\nenized; moreover, if cat\u2019s eyes persist \u0001i.e., the far-field\na\u0002Author to whom correspondence should be addressed.

When the strain field is switched on, cat\u2019s eyes form\naround the radius where the angular velocity of the vortex\nequals that of the strain field. If the strain field is of high\namplitude or left on for a long duration, then when it is\nturned off, cat\u2019s eyes may persist at a radius whose position\ndepends upon how the perturbation vorticity feeds back to\nchange the axisymmetric basic profile.15 In contrast, some\nearlier studies16 have indicated that when cat\u2019s eyes gener-\nated on a Gaussian vortex are vanishingly thin, they are lo-\ncalized at a single specific radius. The full simulations15\ncould not access this limit of infinitesimal thickness, as un-\nfeasibly long runs at very small amplitudes and very high\nReynolds numbers would have been required.\nThe purpose of the current work is to ascertain whether\nfinite thickness cat\u2019s eyes on a Gaussian vortex can be main-\ntained at many radii or whether they are restricted to a single\nspecific radius. Can these cat\u2019s eye structures superimposed\non the vortex be long lived and, if so, what are the key\nproperties of the underlying axisymmetric profile that enable\nit to support a neutral mode? We shall examine these issues\nby calculating the Landau poles of a model axisymmetric\nprofile with a small flattened region or \u201cdefect.\u201d Our chosen\nprofile \u0003detailed in Eq. \u000118\u0002 below\u0004 comprises a standard\nGaussian form supplemented by a three-parameter family of\ndistributions; in essence the three parameters control the am-\nplitude, thickness, and location of the defect. This form of\nvorticity distribution is quite typical of the azimuthal average\nof a vortex that can sustain a cat\u2019s eyes structure through\nvorticity homogenization in the eyes.\nThe present paper is laid out in the following way. In\nSec. II we formulate the Landau pole problem and then in\nSec. III describe how the poles move in the complex plane as\nthe three parameters of the defect are varied. The Landau\npoles are tracked by solving a suitable eigenvalue problem\nformulated in Laplace transform space. The results obtained\nsuggest that a profile with a thin homogenized layer of vor-\nticity can support a neutral mode and, in the limit of a van-\nishingly thin layer, the position of the neutral mode is as\npredicted by the asymptotic work of Le Diz\u00e8s.16 We also\nexamine the large-time behavior of the far-field stream func-\ntion and achieve this by solving the linearized Euler equation\nusing a Keller box method.17 Some concluding remarks are\nmade in Sec. IV.\nII.

First, and conveniently, this mode is next se-\nquentially in a general multipole expansion after the n=1\nmode. On more physically significant grounds, the multipole\nexpansion of a single vortex in a large scale flow will be\ndominated by the n=2 component in the presence of long\ndistance interactions with other vortices; for general n, the\neffect of one vortex on another falls off \rR\u2212n, where R is\ntheir separation, so that the largest dynamical effect corre-\nsponds to n=2. We would also expect qualitatively similar\nresults to those described here for the minority of flows for\nwhich the n=2 mode is completely absent so that the multi-\npole moment with some other n\u000e2 dominates the dynamical\neffects internal to the vortex. Notice that although our calcu-\nlations will be restricted to the n=2 case, we shall retain a\ngeneral n in our formulation to illustrate the role of the mode\nnumber in the structure of the final equations.\nWe define the Laplace transform pair with respect to t by\nf\u00af\u0001p\u0002 = \u0006\n0\n\u000f\neiptf\u0001t\u0002dt , \u00018\u0002\nf\u0001t\u0002 = \u2212 1\n2\u0010\u0006\u000f+i\u0011\n\u2212\u000f+i\u0011\ne\u2212iptf\u00af\u0001p\u0002dp , \u00019\u0002\nwith any real \u0011\u000e0.

The minor difference between the\nangular velocity values of Turner and Gilbert15 and Schecter\net al.10 can be traced to the fact that the former was calcu-\nlated using an infinite domain and the latter a large finite\ndomain.\nThe multipole moment can be written in terms of the\nfar-field form of the stream function by\nQn\u0001t\u0002 = lim\nr\u2192\u000f\n\u0001nrn\u0007n \u2212 rn+1\u0003r\u0007n\u0002\n\u0001see Ref. 12\u0002.

If the axisymmetric vorticity pro-\nfile \u00030\u0001r\u0002 is a smooth decreasing function and if \u000b\u0001rs\u0002 van-\nishes, then it can be shown that there is a neutral mode of the\nvortex.9 Conversely, if \u000b\u0001rs\u0002\u00050 and \u00030\u0001r\u0002 is monotonically\ndecreasing on the whole domain r\u0001 \u00030,r0\u0004, then there are no\ndiscrete eigenmodes of the vortex.9 In the first case the func-\ntion Q\u00af n\u0001p\u0002 possesses a simple pole, which on inverting the\nLaplace transform gives rise to an exponential term in Qn\u0001t\u0002.\nIn the second case, however, we have no simple poles of\nQ\u00af n\u0001p\u0002 and hence no exponential terms in Qn\u0001t\u0002. All the be-\nhavior of Qn\u0001t\u0002 is contained in the branch cut along the real\np-axis in the range n\n\u0001r0\u0002\u0013p\u0013n\n\u00010\u0002. Analytical continua-\ntion techniques enable this branch cut to be deformed below\nthe real p-axis by moving the radial contour of integration in\nEq. \u000112\u0002 above the real r-axis.

This Landau\npole identifies a complex decay rate \u2212ipj =\u0012Q\u2212 in\nQ, where\n\u0012Q\u00140 and \nQ are the decay rate and angular velocity, re-\nspectively. When there are N Landau poles in the analytical\ncontinuation of Q\u00af n\u0001p\u0002, then Qn\u0001t\u0002 takes the form\nQn\u0001t\u0002 = \f\nj=1\nN\nf je\u2212ipjt + a branch cut contribution, \u000114\u0002\nwhere the constants f j depend on the initial conditions. The\nangular velocity \nQ of each quasimode identifies a corre-\nsponding critical radius rQ at which the fluid particles coro-\ntate. This radius is found by solving\n\n\u0001rQ\u0002 = \nQ, \u000115\u0002\nwhere we have used Eq. \u00017\u0002 to write \n\u0001r\u0002 as\n\n\u0001r\u0002 =\n1\nr2\n\u0006\n0\nr\ns\u00030\u0001s\u0002ds .\nFor a pure Gaussian vortex \nG\n0.0089, which gives\nrG\n4.22. With the vortex profiles we consider in this study,\nsmall \nQ corresponds to a large critical radius rQ, while if\n\nQ\n\n\u00010\u0002, then rQ\n0. With a linear combination of contri-\nbutions such as in Eq. \u000114\u0002 it is not clear just how Qn\u0001t\u0002\nmight behave during its early evolution, as the relative val-\nues of the quantities f j are important. Nevertheless, after a\nsufficiently long initial transient, it will be the Landau pole\nwith smallest decay rate that will eventually dominate.\nTo calculate the positions of the Landau poles we used\ncontours in the complex r-plane, parametrized by s, of the\ngeneral form\nr\u0001s\u0002 = tan\r\u00102 \u0007s + i\u00151s exp\u000e 1\u00152\u0001s \u2212 1\u0002\u000f\b\u0010 , \u000116\u0002\nwhere \u00151 and \u00152 are real constants. As s moves from 0 to 1 so\nthe corresponding r-path joins zero to \u0001real\u0002 infinity and a\ntypical form of the contour is sketched in Fig. 3\u0001a\u0002.\nEquation \u000113\u0002 is integrated from s= s\u02dc\t1 to s=1 along\nEq. \u000116\u0002 using a Runge\u2013Kutta method. As r\u21920, it is known\nthat \u0004L\u0001r , p\u0002\u0011rn, and thus we impose the initial conditions\n\u0004L\u0001r\u0001s\u02dc\u0002,p\u0002 = rn\u0001s\u02dc\u0002,\n\u0003\u0004L\n\u0003s\n= nr\u0001\u0001s\u02dc\u0002rn\u22121\u0001s\u02dc\u0002 , \u000117\u0002\nat s= s\u02dc\t1. Of course, in general \u0004L\u00050 at s=1, and thus a\nNewton iteration on the eigenvalue p is used to ensure that\n\u0004L vanishes at this endpoint. An alternative strategy for\nsolving Eq. \u000113\u0002 subject to homogeneous boundary condi-\ntions relies on a global eigenvalue method20 that generates a\ndiscrete approximation to the continuous spectrum as well as\nfinding any poles around which the inversion contour has to\nbe deformed. The global method is used to give an initial\nstarting value to the eigenvalue p for the iterative local\nmethod, which is generally the more accurate. An example of\nthe global solution to Eq. \u000113\u0002 is shown in Fig. 3\u0001b\u0002, which\nillustrates the continuous spectrum together with four Lan-\ndau poles.\nBearing in mind our objective to investigate when a cat\u2019s\neyes structure might be relatively long lived, we consider the\nthree-parameter family of axisymmetric profiles given by\n\u00030\u0001r;\u0016,\u0005,rc\u0002 =\n1\n4\u0010\ne\u2212r\n2\/4 + \u0016\nrc\u0001r \u2212 rc\u0002\n8\u0010\n\u0017exp\u000e r4rc \u00012 \u2212 rc2\u0002 \u2212 12 \u2212 \u0001r \u2212 rc\u0002\n2\n\u00052\n\u000f . \u000118\u0002\nHere, \u0016, \u0005, and rc denote the amplitude, thickness, and radius\nof the defect, respectively.

The form of Eq. \u000118\u0002 is that of a\nGaussian vortex that has been flattened off in the vicinity of\nthe critical rc; as mentioned earlier, this type of profile is\ncharacteristic of those for which cat\u2019s eyes are observed.

This zone can be thought of as the\nazimuthal average of a vortex that has cat\u2019s eyes at a radius\nrc of thickness \u0005, which have been formed through some\nnonlinear mechanism. However, vortices containing cat\u2019s\neyes, which have been generated in fully nonlinear simula-\ntions, do not have a smooth azimuthal profile15 but, instead,\ntypically contain a flattened region with fine scale structure\ndue to the nonlinear interactions. They also generally have\nsharper vorticity gradients around the flattened region than\nare present in the idealized profile \u0003Eq. \u000118\u0002\u0004. Thus, our\nmodel used here might be helpful for understanding the be-\nhaviors of thin cat\u2019s eyes, but nonlinear interactions need to\nbe considered for our results to be confirmed.\nIII. RESULTS\nIn this section we describe results of the Landau pole\ncalculations and the linear code simulations for the profiles\ngiven by Eq. \u000118\u0002. We shall have frequent cause to refer to\nthe real and imaginary parts of Landau poles pj and thus it is\nto be remembered that these quantities correspond to n mul-\ntiples of the angular velocity \nQ and the decay rate \u0012Q of the\nvortex quasimode, respectively.\nA. Landau pole calculations\nThe Landau pole calculations rely on the parameters \u00151\nand \u00152 in Eq. \u000116\u0002 being chosen so that the corresponding\ncontour of the continuous spectrum in the p-plane is bent\nsufficiently to reveal the poles we wish to follow. All the\nresults here used \u00151\u0001 \u00031.5,5\u0004 and \u00152\u0001 \u00030.4,2.2\u0004 with the\nparticular values governed by the nature of the underlying\nvorticity \u00030\u0001r\u0002. In the limits of small \u0005 and extreme rc \u0001either\nsmall or large\u0002, we found that it was not always possible to\ntrack all the poles of interest as the contour in the p-plane\noften becomes very knotted and intricate. Moreover, the\npoles then become easily confused with the continuous spec-\ntrum. That said, however, we were able to capture the behav-\nior of the poles sufficiently well to make some useful obser-\nvations.\nWe have a three-dimensional parameter space \u0001\u0016 ,\u0005 ,rc\u0002\nto investigate and for the parameter ranges considered, we\ngenerally found that the values of \u00151 and \u00152 in Eq. \u000116\u0002 led to\nthree Landau poles of interest in the p-plane; the only excep-\ntion occurs when \u0016=1 when an extra pole appears. We ex-\nplored our parameter space systematically by fixing the pa-\nrameters two at a time and then allowing the third to vary.\nFigure 5 plots the imaginary parts Im\u0001p\u0002=\u0012Q of three Landau\npoles as the basic vorticity changes.\nFigure 5\u0001a\u0002 relates to a defect of moderate thickness\n\u0005=0.5 positioned at rc=4, whose amplitude 0\u0013\u0016\u00131. For\n\u0016=0 we have a Gaussian profile, which has a Landau pole at\npG=0.0177\u22120.0063i, which corresponds to pole 1. As \u0016 is\nincreased from zero, so poles 2 and 3 move in quickly from\nthe large negative imaginary region of the p-plane. One of\nthe poles \u0001pole 3\u0002 has a larger decay rate than the other two\nfor all the values of \u0016 considered and hence is expected to be\ninsignificant for the initial decay of the perturbation. Poles 1\nand 2 have very similar decay rates for 0\u0014\u0016\u00140.2, so it is\nunclear at which rate the vortex quasimode will decay in this\nregion. As we approach the case of a flat region at r=rc in\n\u00030\u0001r\u0002 \u0001i.e., the amplitude of the defect \u0016=1\u0002, then we find\nthat the original Gaussian quasimode Landau pole \u0001pole 1\u0002\nagain has the smallest decay rate, and hence should dominate\nthe initial decay of the perturbation.\nIn Fig. 5\u0001b\u0002 the defect has a small fixed amplitude\n\u0016=0.1 and is positioned at the point rc=4, but has a variable\nthickness \u0005. The two Landau poles that had similar decay\nrates in Fig. 5\u0001a\u0002 continue to do so over the whole range of \u0005\ninvestigated. Pole 3 is again insignificant over most of the\n\u0005-domain as it has a much larger decay rate than the other\ntwo, although, as \u0005 becomes smaller \u0001i.e., as the defect thins\u0002,\nthe presence of this third pole becomes more important.\nLastly, the defect in Fig. 5\u0001c\u0002 has a fixed small amplitude\n\u0001\u0016=0.1\u0002 and is of moderate thickness \u0001\u0005=0.5\u0002, but is moved\naround by varying rc. Close to rc=4, the two poles, which\nwere almost coincident in Fig. 5\u0001a\u0002, remain near to each\nother, and actually swap places. We would therefore expect\nthe decay rate of the perturbation to change between these\ntwo values with a corresponding jump in frequency \u0001cf. Fig.\n10 later\u0002. Pole 3 again remains insignificant for the values of\nrc considered here; however, for large rc \u0001i.e., when the de-\nfect is positioned well away from the vortex core\u0002 this pole\ntends to the Landau pole value for a Gaussian vortex noted\nearlier. As rc is moved towards the origin, with \u0005 still mod-\nerately large, the core of the vortex becomes increasingly\ndeformed and sharp gradients of vorticity form around the\ndefect. Consequently, results with rc\u00141 and moderate \u0005 need\nto be treated with care although if the thickness of the defect\n\u0005 is reduced as rc moves towards the origin then results for\nsmaller values of rc can be attained.\nFigure 5\u0001a\u0002 suggests that when there is a flat region in\nthe profile \u0001\u0016=1\u0002, there appears to be a single Landau pole\nwhich dominates the decay of the perturbation. This is ex-\namined further in Fig. 6, which shows the real and imaginary\nparts of the significant Landau poles as functions of the de-\nfect position rc for amplitude \u0016=1 and thickness \u0005=0.5. We\nsee that there are now four Landau poles which appear in the\nregion of the p-plane we consider. Figure 6\u0001b\u0002 shows that\npoles 3 and 4 are not important in the evolution of the per-\nturbation, as their decay rates are larger than the other two.\n0.06\n0.04\n0.02\n543210\nr\n\u21260\nFIG. 4.

We see that as the defect thick-\nness \u0005 decreases from \u0005=0.5 \u0001solid line\u0002 the maximum\ngrowth rate value increases. However, when \u0005=0.3 \u0001dotted\nline\u0002 we see that there are now two maxima in the growth\nrate curve and these both have \u0012Q=0; i.e., they are both\nneutral modes of the vortex. As \u0005 is reduced further, both the\nneutral modes remain, but their positions separate. This sug-\ngests that cat\u2019s eyes of a given finite thickness \u0005, which have\nan azimuthal average profile that contains an annulus of ho-\nmogenized vorticity, can persist at two distinct radii. As\n\u0005\u21920 we expect to recover the result of Le Diz\u00e8s,16 who\nshowed that vanishingly thin cat\u2019s eyes can only possess a\nneutral mode at the one radius rLD=3.44 \u0001using our scalings\u0002.\nFigure 8\u0001a\u0002 plots the value of rc at which the maximum\nvalue of Im\u0001p\u0002=\u0012Q occurs as a function of the defect thick-\nness \u0005 \u0001with \u0016=1\u0002. When \u0005\u00180.35, there are two positions at\nwhich the maximum \u0012Q occurs; at these points \u0012Q is zero and\nthus these correspond to neutral modes. Figure 8\u0001b\u0002 shows\nthe dependence of 2\nQ=Re\u0001p\u0002, where the minimum value of\n\u0012Q occurs as a function of the thickness \u0005. The neutral mode\nthat moves towards the origin \u0001branch 2\u0002 has an angular ve-\nlocity that increases as \u0005 is reduced, and in the limit \u0005\u21920, so\n\nQ\u21921 \/4\u0010. Le Diz\u00e9s16 has shown that a vanishingly thin\ncritical layer cannot exist at the origin, and we leave the issue\nof the limit \u0005\u21920 along branch 2 as a topic for future study.\nLinear extrapolation suggests that the position and angular\nvelocity of the branch 1 neutral mode tend to rc=3.448 and\n\nQ=0.0127 as \u0005\u21920. Both of these results agree with the\nresults rLD=3.44 and \nLD=0.0127 derived by Le Diz\u00e8s16\nwith errors of less than 1%.\nAn explanation for the occurrence of the two neutral\nmodes seen in Figs. 7 and 8 is offered by Fig. 9.

We see that when \u0005=0.4 or 0.5, the critical radius rc\nalways exceeds rQ.

On the other hand, the curves for\nother thicknesses have rQ=rc twice at the two values of rc\ngiven in Fig. 8\u0001a\u0002. Thus, the positions of the neutral modes\ncorrespond to points where the quasimode critical layer oc-\ncurs exactly at the center of the flat region of the profile, i.e.,\nthe singular point of Eq. \u000113\u0002, r=rQ, is where \u000b=0. As the\nthickness \u0005 of the flat region is reduced from 0.5 \u0001reading up\nthe curves\u0002, we find that the peak of the growth rate curve\nmoves towards the line rQ=rc and at \u0005\n0.35, the curve and\nline become tangent to one another and there is a single\nneutral mode of the vortex. For values of \u0005\u00180.35, there are\ntwo neutral modes; one of these moves towards rc=3.448\nand the other approaches rc=0 as the defect thickness\n\u0005\u21920.\nB. Comparison with linear code\nNext we compare our Landau pole calculations with re-\nsults determined by numerically solving Eq. \u00015\u0002 using a\nKeller box17 routine from the NAG suite; see Ref. 12 for\nmore details. The scheme imposes an external flow which\ninstantaneously distorts the vortex and then allows it to\nevolve freely over time. This problem is of initial value type\nand thus the decay rate and angular velocity measured from\nthe solution of Eq. \u00015\u0002 are time dependent. To estimate the\nvalues \u0012Q and \nQ, we took the best linear fit of the data\nbetween two time values that occur just before the vortex\nleaves the linear decay part of its evolution \u0001i.e., just before\nthe vortex leaves regime A in a case such as Fig. 2\u0002. These\ntimes were decided by a preliminary run of the code, from\nwhich we estimated the instant t2 when the vortex changes\nregime. The earlier time was then taken to be t1= t2\u22121000,\nand then a re-run of the code gave decay rates and angular\nvelocities that agree very well with the Landau pole theory.\nThe results outlined in Sec. III A show that in certain\nregions of our three-dimensional parameter space, one Lan-\ndau pole dominates over the others, and hence we expect the\nmultipole moment Q2\u0001t\u0002 to decay exponentially with a decay\nrate and angular velocity given by this Landau pole. How-\never, this is not completely obvious because this quasimode\ndecay is just a transient \u0001see regime A in Fig. 2\u0002 and thus\nthere is only a finite time over which a decay rate can be\nmeasured before the contribution from the branch cut takes\nover. Hence, to assess at what rate the vortex perturbations\nactually decay in the early stages, we used the numerical\nscheme above to compare with our Landau pole results.\nFigure 10 shows results from the solution to the linear\nequations \u00015\u0002 and \u00016\u0002 together with the Landau poles corre-\nsponding to the smallest decay rates for amplitude \u0016=1 and\nthickness \u0005=0.5 as in Fig. 6. Figure 10\u0001a\u0002 demonstrates very\ngood agreement between the predictions of the linear code\nand the real part of the Landau pole with the larger of the\ntwo angular velocities, at least for 2.5\u0014rc\u00145. However,\nwhen the flat defect is centered at rc\n5, a sudden change in\nthe angular velocity of the perturbation occurs and the linear\ncode results correlate with the Landau pole with the smaller\nof the two angular velocities once rc\u000e5. The reason for this\nfrequency jump is suggested in Fig. 10\u0001b\u0002, which shows the\nimaginary part of the Landau pole \u0001=\u0012Q\u0002. The linear code\ngives a growth rate that agrees with the Landau pole with\nsmallest decay rate for 2.5\u0014rc\u00145; however, at rc\n5 an-\nother Landau pole acquires a smaller decay rate, and thus the\nvortex perturbation switches onto this new rate, with the cor-\nresponding angular velocity given by this pole \u0003see Fig.\n10\u0001a\u0002\u0004. The reason the two methods are not in complete\nagreement for rc\u000e5 is because when the decay rates of these\ntwo Landau poles become close, the vortex decays with a\nlinear combination of the two decay rates and frequencies\nand distinguishing between them is not particularly easy.\nFigure 11 considers the far-field amplitude ln\tQ2\u0001t\u0002\t for a\nvorticity profile with amplitude \u0016=1, thickness \u0005=0.5, and\ndefect position rc=5.2 \u0001solid line\u0002. This value of rc lies close\nto the point where the two growth rate curves meet in Fig.\n6\u0001b\u0002. The two straight lines represent two decay rates: the\nfirst given by the best fit analysis of the linear code \u0001dashed\nline\u0002 and the second by the dominant Landau pole \u0001dotted\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\n0.04\n2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5 5.5 6\nRe(p)\nrc\n-0.003\n-0.002\n-0.001\n0\n2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5 5.5 6\nIm(p)\nrc(a) (b)\nFIG. 10.

We can see that due to the oscillations in ln\tQ2\t a best\nfit line would depend on the time interval chosen in which to\ntake the approximation and because this initial exponential\ndecay is only a transient we cannot integrate until one Lan-\ndau pole clearly dominates the solution; this is the reason for\nthe small discrepancy between the results in Fig. 10 once\nrc\u000e5. The decay rate given by the Landau pole in Fig. 11\n\u0001dotted line\u0002 is in good agreement with the decay rate of\nln\tQ2\t, and hence the vortex perturbation really does dimin-\nish at the rate corresponding to that Landau pole with the\nslowest decay rate.\nThe Landau pole calculation in Fig. 7 of Sec. III A\nshows that for defect thicknesses \u0005\u00140.35, there are two po-\nsitions rc, where Im\u0001p\u0002=\u0012Q=0, and hence two radii that can\nsupport a neutral mode. We can confirm that a vortex does\nadmit these two neutral modes by using the linear code for\nthe basic profile with \u0016=1 and \u0005=0.3. The outcome is illus-\ntrated in Fig. 12; it is concluded that the linear code \u0001dashed\nline\u0002 and the Landau pole result \u0001solid line\u0002 are in excellent\nagreement, and the frequencies n\nQ=Re\u0001p\u0002 from the two\ncalculations \u0001not shown\u0002 turn out to be indistinguishable over\nthis range of rc.\nFigure 13 plots ln\tRe\u0001Q2\u0001t\u0002\u0002\t for the Gaussian vortex and\nfour vorticity profiles, all with defect amplitude \u0016=1 and\nthickness \u0005=0.5, but with various positions in the range\n1\u0013rc\u001310. The Gaussian vortex \u0001curve 1\u0002, discussed in Sec.\nII, has an initial period of exponential decay with\n\u0012G\n\u22120.0063 followed by an interval of decay related to the\nlarge-r form of the vorticity and finally a region of algebraic\ndecay linked to the remnant of vorticity in the core of the\nvortex \u0001see regimes B and C of Fig. 2\u0002. What makes Fig. 13\nso interesting is that all the results with \u0016=1 \u0001curves 2\u20135\u0002\nappear to decay at exactly the same rate and with the angular\nvelocity of the Gaussian vortex \u0001curve 1\u0002, at least up to some\ntime. Thereafter, they start to decay exponentially at a rate\ndetermined by the dominant Landau pole. Finally, when \tQ2\t\ndrops below some threshold, the vortex perturbation begins\nto decay algebraically \u0001see curve 4\u0002 as for the \u0016=0 case.\nCurve 4 with rc=6 exhibits a small region of nonexponential\ndecay at t\n2500 before decaying at the Landau pole value.\nThe decay rates for rc=10 and 9 \u0001curves 2 and 3, respec-\ntively\u0002 both tend to the exponential decay rate given by the\ndominant Landau pole. At larger values of rc, the amplitude\nthreshold for the algebraic decay may be reached before this\nperiod of exponential decay occurs; in this case the exponen-\ntial decay may not be observed.\nThe features in real space of a quasimode for a profile\n\u000118\u0002 with a defect are illustrated by Fig. 14, which can be\ncompared with the purely Gaussian case in Fig. 1. This figure\nshows a n=2 disturbance to a profile with a defect at\nrc=2.85. Again we see a combination of spiral wind-up\ncoupled with the modal behavior, in which the elliptical dis-\ntortion gives a sign of vorticity that depends on angle \u0001\nrather than on radius. At the early time, the picture in Fig.\n14\u0001a\u0002 is similar to the Gaussian case in Fig. 1\u0001a\u0002 with the flat\ndefect at rc=2.85 clearly visible. However, at late times in\nFig. 14\u0001b\u0002 we note that the elliptical distortion is still present\n\u0001unlike in the Gaussian case\u0002, showing that the quasimode\n-30\n-20\n-10\n0\n0 4000 8000 12000 16000\nt\nln|Q |2\nFIG. 11.

We can\nalso see how the defect interacts with the vorticity in the\nneighborhood of rc=2.85, where the spiral arms are broader.\nIt is in this region where cat\u2019s eyes \u0001of a width of order\n\u0005=0.3\u0002 could be maintained in the full nonlinear problem.\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\nIn this paper we have studied how an axisymmetric vor-\ntex relaxes after being subjected to a weak, instantaneous,\nnonaxisymmetric forcing. This has been accomplished using\na two-pronged numerical approach; one of these relies on the\ntracking of Landau poles in the complex plane while the\nother is a Keller-box strategy applied to the linear problem.\nOur underlying vortex has been taken to be a Gaussian type\nwhich has been modified by inclusion of zone where the\nprofile is artificially flattened. After a transient, the nonaxi-\nsymmetric perturbation decays with a decay rate and fre-\nquency fixed by the Landau pole that has the least negative\nimaginary part. The time taken for the perturbation to start to\ndecay at this Landau pole rate depends upon the structure of\nthe axisymmetric profile.\nFor a profile with a flat region of thickness \u0005\u00180.35 po-\nsitioned at r=rc, we have shown that two neutral modes exist\nat two distinct values of r=rc. Moreover, in the limit as the\ndefect thickness \u0005\u21920, one of these neutral modes moves to\nthe point rc=3.448, in accord with the asymptotic results of\nLe Diz\u00e8s.16 Thus, this study suggests that when cat\u2019s eyes\nbelow a critical thickness are generated in a vortex via a\nnonlinear mechanism, they can persist at two distinct radii.\nHowever, nonlinear mechanisms rarely give axisymmetric\nprofiles as clean as the ones studied in this paper and the fine\nscale structure within the eyes often becomes significant. It is\nclear that further detailed numerical work is required to as-\ncertain whether our conclusions can be extended to nonlinear\nsituations.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was undertaken on the EPSRC Grant No. EP\/\nD032202\/1.\n1B.
