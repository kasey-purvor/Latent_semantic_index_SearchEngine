INTRODUCTION\nGeneralized multicarrier code-division multiple access (GMC-\nCDMA) has recently received increasing interests for high\ndata rate transmissions [1]-[2]. Relying on the precoding\nredundancy, [1] has shown that signal recovery for GMC-\nCDMA systems is independent of channel null (deep fade)\nlocations. Hence, for uncoded systems, GMC-CDMA out-\nperforms the conventional MC-CDMA in frequency-selective\nfading channels. As an orthogonal frequency-division mul-\ntiplexing (OFDM) based technique, GMC-CDMA is very\nsensitive to carrier frequency offset (CFO) [3]. A good CFO\nestimator is acquired to improve the overall system perfor-\nmance. In literatures, many data-aided and non data-aided\nCFO estimators have been reported for multicarrier systems\n(e.g. [6]-[10]). However, very few publications have ad-\ndressed so far on exploiting hidden pilots for the CFO esti-\nmation. This motivated us to develop a novel CFO estimator\nby using hidden pilots.\nOriginally, techniques using hidden pilots were proposed\nfor low-complexity estimation of static channels (or slowly\ntime-varying channels) in single-carrier systems (see [4],\n[5]). In this paper, we deploy the hidden pilots in the GMC-\nCDMA system for the accurate CFO estimation. The pro-\nposed CFO estimator consists of two sub-estimators oper-\nThe work in this paper was supported by EU-IST 4More, No. IST-\n2002-507039.\nating in the frequency domain. Using the cyclic-statistics\n(CS) algorithm, the first sub-estimator is able to mitigate the\nnormalized CFO (NCFO) to a small error value. This error\nis mainly from the quantization noise in the CS-based sub-\nestimator. The second sub-estimator is based on the linear-\nregression (LR) algorithm. It is shown that the LR-based\nestimator performs well for the case of small NCFO, and is\na good compensation to the CS-based estimator. Simulation\nresults are provided to confirm our theoretical analysis.\n2. GMC-CDMA WITH HIDDEN PILOTS\nThe discrete-time equivalent model for the downlink of GMC-\nCDMA system has been presented in [1], [2]. Considering\nthe CFO, Fig. 1 depicts the downlink GMC-CDMA model\nwith hidden pilots. Prior to transmission, the information-\nbearing symbols are grouped into blocks sM (n) with the\nsize of M \u00d7 1, where n denotes the block index. Then,\nthese blocks are fed to a K \u00d7 M block precoder \u0398 to pro-\nduce blocks sK(n) = \u0398sM (n). In the GMC-CDMA sys-\ntem,\u0398 is used for the user signatures and also introduce the\nprecoding redundancy (K > M ) [1]. Let Lt = K \u2212 M ,\nwe construct another block precoder \u0398t with the size of\nK \u00d7 Lt. This precoder is used to precode the hidden-pilot\nblocks p(n), with the input-output relationship of p\u02dc(n) =\n\u0398tp(n). Then, we feed the sum of sK(n) and p\u02dc(n) to the\nCP-OFDM modulator F. The matrix F = [FT\ncp\n, FTK ]\nT has\nthe size of J \u00d7 K (J = K + Lcp), where Lcp denotes\nthe length of cyclic prefix (CP); (\u00b7)T denotes the matrix\ntranspose; FK denotes the inverse discrete Fourier trans-\nform (IDFT) matrix with the size of K \u00d7K; Fcp is formed\nby collecting the last Lcp rows of FK . The output of CP-\nOFDM modulator (or transmitted block) is given by\nx(n) = FW[sTM (n),p\nT (n)]T (1)\nwhereW = [\u0398,\u0398t] is usually formed by a Walsh matrix\nin GMC-CDMA systems. The detail description on how to\nobtain the output (1) can be found in [1].\nThe transmitted blocks experience the propagation chan-\nnel h = [h(0), h(1), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , h(Lu)]\nT , where Lu denotes the\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Considering the CFO,\nthe received blocks can be formulated as (see [1], [6])\nyJ(n) = \u2126JHlx(n) +\u2126JHux(n\u2212 1)\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nIBI\n+vJ(n) (2)\nwhereHl andHu are J\u00d7J lower and upper triangular ma-\ntrices with entries [Hl]n,k = h(n\u2212k) and [Hu]n,k = h(J+\nn\u2212k). vJ(n) is the zero-mean Gaussian noise with the size\nof J\u00d71; The diagonal matrix\u2126J = diag{\u03a6\nnJ ,\u03a6nJ+1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\n\u03a6(n+1)J\u22121} comprises the CFO information with \u03a6 =\nexp(j 2piK \u03c6), where \u03c6 denotes the CFO normalized by the\nsubcarrier spacing \u2206f . Normally, for the CP length Lcp >\nLu, the inter-block interference (IBI) part can be removed\nby discarding CP at the receiver, and the remaining part be-\ncomes\nyK(n) = \u2126KCKFKW[s\nT\nM (n),p\nT (n)]T + vK(n) (3)\nwhere\u2126K = diag{\u03a6\nnJ+Lcp ,\u03a6nJ+Lcp+1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\u03a6(n+1)J\u22121},\nCK is the circulant channel matrix addressed in [1], vK(n)\nis the corresponding noise vector. We perform the DFT on\nyK(n) and obtain the frequency-domain blocks as\ny\u02dcK(n) = \u03a6\nnJ+Lcp(DKW[s\nT\nM (n),p\nT (n)]T + is(n)\n+ ip(n)) + v\u02dcK(n) (4)\nwhere \u2126\u00afK = diag{\u03a6\n0,\u03a61, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\u03a6K\u22121}, v\u02dcK(n) = F\n\u22121\nK vK(n);\nis(n) and ip(n) are the inter-carrier interferences (ICIs) con-\ntributed by the information symbols and pilots respectively;\nDK = D(h\u02dc), where h\u02dc denotes the channel frequency-response\n(CFR) with the size of K \u00d7 1, and D(a) denotes the diag-\nonal matrix with a in its diagonal. Then, we have three\ncomments on (4):\n1) The pilot blocks are assumed to be invariant with re-\nspect to the block index n. So, we can omit the index\nn in pilot-related terms p\u02dc(n), p(n) and ip(n) for con-\nvenience;\n2) The ICI term is(n) is contributed by s(n), and thus\nhas the zero-mean and is uncorrelated for the block\nindex n [3];\n3) When \u03c6 and h are known at the receiver, the CFO\nand pilot blocks can be eliminated from (3). Then,\nthe zero-forcing (ZF) equalization can be employed\nin the frequency-domain. [1] has shown that DK has\nat most Lu zeros on its diagonal, so the signal recov-\nery is independent of channel null (deep fade) loca-\ntions only when Lt > Lu and any M rows of \u0398 are\nlinear independent;\nLater on, we present how to use hidden pilots for the CFO\nestimation.\n3. ESTIMATION OF CFO\n3.1. The CS-based estimator\nUsing the CS algorithm for the CFO estimation was origi-\nnally proposed in [12], where the pulse-shaping filter at the\ntransmitter plays the key role to introduce the cyclic spec-\ntrum. Then, this method was applied in multicarrier systems\n[9]. In our method, the cyclic-spectrum is enabled by the\nhidden pilots.\nWe start the analysis from the autocorrelation of the re-\nceived blocks (4), and obtain the correlation matrix as\nCy\u02dcK y\u02dcK (n, n\u03c4 )\n= E{y\u02dcK(n+ n\u03c4 )y\u02dc\nH\nK(n)}\n= \u03a6n\u03c4J (DK(\u0398CsMsM (n\u03c4 )\u0398\nH + Cp\u02dcp\u02dc)D\nH\nK\n+DK(\u0398CsM is(n\u03c4 ) + Cp\u02dcip) + (C\nH\nsM is\n(n\u03c4 )\u0398\nH\n+CHp\u02dcip)D\nH\nK + Cisis(n\u03c4 ) + Cipip) + Cv\u02dcK v\u02dcK (n\u03c4 )(5)\nwhere Cab(n, n\u03c4 ) = E{a(n+n\u03c4 )b\nH(n)}1 for column vec-\ntors a and b. Based on the comments 1) and 2) in Section\nII, for the lag n\u03c4 6= 0, it is easy to obtain: CsMsM (n\u03c4 ) = 0,\nCsM is(n\u03c4 ) = 0, Cisis(n\u03c4 ) = 0, Cv\u02dcK v\u02dcK (n\u03c4 ) = 0, then (5)\ncan be represented as\nCy\u02dcK y\u02dcK (n, n\u03c4 6= 0) = \u03a6\nn\u03c4J\u03a80 (6)\nwhere\n\u03a80 = DKCp\u02dcp\u02dcD\nH\nK + DKCp\u02dcip + C\nH\np\u02dcip\nD\nH\nK + Cipip (7)\nWe can see that the matrix \u03a80 is constant with respect to\nthe lag n\u03c4 . Therefore, Cy\u02dcK y\u02dcK (n, n\u03c4 > 0) is a periodic\nfunction of n\u03c4 with the period of\nK\nJ\u03c6 by assuming that the\nmatrix \u03a80 is not zero (justification of this assumption will\nbe given later). For n\u03c4 \u2208 (0, N \u2212 1], we perform the DFT\non (6) and obtain (see [11] for DFT property)\nC\u02dcy\u02dcK y\u02dcK (n,m\u03c4 )\n=\n1\nN \u2212 1\nN\u22121\u2211\nn\u03c4=1\nCy\u02dcK y\u02dcK (n, n\u03c4 )e\n\u2212j 2pi\nN\u22121m\u03c4n\u03c4\n= e\u2212j\n2pi\nN\u22121 (m\u03c4\u2212\n(N\u22121)J\u03c6\nK\n)\u03a80S(m\u03c4 \u2212\n(N \u2212 1)J\u03c6\nK\n)(8)\nwhere\nS(x) =\nsin(pix)\n(N \u2212 1) sin( piN\u22121x)\ne\u2212j\nN\u22122\nN\u22121pix\nForm\u03c4 > 0, the norm of C\u02dcy\u02dcK y\u02dcK (n,m\u03c4 ) is given by\n\u2016C\u02dcy\u02dcK y\u02dcK (n,m\u03c4 )\u2016 = \u2016\u03a80\u2016|S(m\u03c4 \u2212\n(N \u2212 1)J\u03c6\nK\n)| (9)\n1If a(n) and b(n) are wide-sense stationary, then Cab(n, n\u03c4 ) is not\nthe function of n and expressible as Cab(n\u03c4 ).

Since m\u03c4 is an integer, the maximum of\n|S(m\u03c4 \u2212\n(N\u22121)J\u03c6\nK )| should located at\nm\u02c6\u03c4 = \u230a\n(N \u2212 1)J\u03c6\nK\n+\n1\n2\n\u230b (10)\nwhere \u230a\u00b7\u230b denotes the integer floor. Hence, we can first de-\ntermine such a m\u02c6\u03c4 by searching the maximum of \u2016C\u02dcy\u02dcK y\u02dcK (n,m\u03c4 )\u2016\nover m\u03c4 \u2208 [0, N \u2212 2]. Then, the NCFO can be estimated\nvia\n\u03c6\u02c6 =\nKm\u02c6\u03c4\n(N \u2212 1)J\n(11)\nThen, we provide three comments:\n3.1.1. Estimation range\nFor m\u03c4 \u2208 [0, N \u2212 2], the maximum identifiable NCFO,\ndenoted by \u03c6\u02c6max, can be derived from (11)\n\u03c6\u02c6max =\n(N \u2212 2)K\n(N \u2212 1)J\n(12)\nDue to the effect of frequency fold, the estimate range of\nCFO is given by |\u03c6| 6 \u230a\n(N\u22122)K\n2(N\u22121)J \u230b.\n3.1.2. Quantization noise\nSince m\u03c4 is an integer, the relationship between \u03c6 and m\u03c4\ncan be derived from (10) and (11) as\n\u03c6 =\nK(m\u03c4 + \u03b4M )\n(N \u2212 1)J\n(13)\nwhere |\u03b4M | 6 0.5 is the quantization noise. This noise may\nincur the CFO estimation error as\n|\u03c6\u02c6\u2212 \u03c6| =\nK|\u03b4M |\n(N \u2212 1)J\n6\nK\n2(N \u2212 1)J\n(14)\nCertainly, this error can be further mitigated by increasing\nN .\n3.1.3. Computation complexity\nThe computation complexity of the CS-based approach is\nmainly from the DFT operation. Even though it is usually\nreplaced by FFT, (8) still needs the complexity ofO(K2(N\u2212\n1) log(N \u2212 1)).\n3.2. The LR-based estimator\nThe linear regression estimator is based on the following\nequation\nC(n, n\u03c4 ) = Cy\u02dcK y\u02dcK (n, n\u03c4 )C\nH\ny\u02dcK y\u02dcK\n(n, 1) = \u03a6(n\u03c4\u22121)J\u0393 (15)\nwhere \u0393 = \u03a80\u03a8\nH\n0\nis a Hermitian matrix. The trace of\nC(n, n\u03c4 ) is given by\nTr{C(n, n\u03c4 )} = \u03a6\n(n\u03c4\u22121)JTr{\u0393} (16)\nDue to \u03a80 6= 0, Tr{\u0393} should be positive. So, we can\nobtain the phase of Tr{C(n, n\u03c4 )} using\n\u03d5(n\u03c4 ) = arg{Tr{C(n, n\u03c4 )}}\n=\n2piJ\u03c6\nK\n(n\u03c4 \u2212 1)\u2212 2pi\u230a\n2n\u03c4 + T\u03d5\n2T\u03d5\n\u230b (17)\nwhere arg{x} is a function to obtain the phase of x, for\narg{x} \u2208 [\u2212pi, pi); T\u03d5 =\nK\nJ\u03c6 is the period of the function\n\u03d5(n\u03c4 ); Assuming T\u03d5 to be known, we can form a first-order\npolynomial f(n\u03c4 ) = an\u03c4 + b and determine the parameters\n(a, b) by solving the following equation\n(a\u02c6, b\u02c6) = argmin\n(a\u02c6,b\u02c6)\n\u230aT\u03d5\/2\u230b\u2211\nn\u03c4=1\n|\u03d5(n\u03c4 )\u2212 f(n\u03c4 )|\n2 (18)\nIt is easy to find that a\u02c6 is the estimated slope of \u03d5(n\u03c4 ),\nwhich is identifiable by using the LR algorithm. Then, the\nNCFO \u03c6 can be determined by\n\u03c6\u02c6 =\nK\n2piJ\na\u02c6 (19)\nThe following points should be noted for the LR-based ap-\nproach:\n3.2.1. Estimation performance\nEqn. (18) shows that the curve fitting performance improves\nwith the increase of T\u03d5. However, T\u03d5 is inverse proportional\nto the NCFO. Hence, the estimation performance becomes\nworse with the increase of NCFO.\n3.2.2. About \u230aT\u03d5\/2\u230b\n(18) shows that the knowledge of \u230aT\u03d5\/2\u230b is required for\nthe successful CFO estimation. To determine \u230aT\u03d5\/2\u230b, we\nperform the differential operation on \u03d5(n\u03c4 ) and have\n\u2206\u03d5(n\u03c4 ) = \u03d5(n\u03c4 + 1)\u2212 \u03d5(n\u03c4 )\n=\n{\n\u03b3, for n\u03c4 = \u230a(2i+ 1)T\u03d5\/2\u230b\n2piJ\u03c6\nK , otherwise\n(20)\nwhere i = 0, 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , and \u03b3 is very close or equal to \u22122pi 2.\nDue to |\n2piJ\u03c6\nK | << |\u03b3| , we can find \u230aT\u03d5\/2\u230b by searching\nthe first location of \u03b3 over n\u03c4 \u2208 (0, N \u2212 1). If there does\nnot have such a \u03b3, then we set \u230aT\u03d5\/2\u230b = N \u2212 1.\n2\n\u03b3 = \u22122pi holds only when T\u03d5 is an integer.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Since DK contains at most Lu zeros on its\ndiagonal, this condition can be achieved when p\u02dc has at least\nLu + 1 nonzero elements.\n4.

The sub-\ncarrier spacing,\u2206f , of 312.5KHz, was the same as HIPER-\nLAN\/2 [14]. Elements in the pilot block p were identical.\nThe pilot-to-information power ratio was given by Lt\/M .\nThe signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is defined by the average\nreceived symbol energy to noise Es\/No [15]. Based on the\nabove parameters, we find that the block p\u02dc results in eight\nnon-zero elements with the equal amplitudes. As shown in\nSec. III-C, the CFO identifiability can be guaranteed by em-\nploying this kind of pilot design.\nTest Case 1: This experiment examines the esti-\nmation performance as a function of NCFO with SNR=5\nand 15dB respectively. The RMSE results were obtained by\ntaking average of I = 500 Monte Carlo trials. Each trial\ncollected N = 200 GMC-CDMA blocks for the CFO es-\ntimation. Fig. 2 shows that the RMSE for the CS-based\napproach is very stable (around 2 \u00d7 10\u22123). This result has\na good match with the quantization error in (14). In the\nrange of large NCFO (e.g. |\u03c6| > 0.15), we can observe\nthat the LR-based approach cannot offer a good estimation\ndue to the relatively short T\u03d5. The estimation performance\nimproves significantly with the decrease of NCFO. When\nNCFO is small (e.g. |\u03c6| < 0.1), the LR-based approach\noutperforms the CS-based approach.\nTest Case 2: To evaluate the sub-estimators for dif-\nferent SNR cases, we plot the RMSE results in Fig. 3 with\nthe NCFO \u03c6 = 0.0625 and the data record length N = 100\nblocks. Fig. 3 shows that the CS-based sub-estimator is not\nsensitive to the SNR. The RMSE result for the LR-based\nestimator becomes stable and offers the best performance\nfor SNR> 10dB. In order to compare with stat-of-the-art\napproaches, we also plot the RMSE results for the pulse-\nshaping [9] based CFO estimators. Fig. 3 shows that the\nproposed estimators outperform the pulse-shaping based.\nTest Case 3: In order to indicate the performance-\ncomplexity tradeoff, we examine the RMSE results as a\nfunction of data record length N with \u03c6 = 0.0625 and the\ntypical SNR= 12dB. Fig. 4 shows that RMSE for CFO es-\ntimators decreases rapidly with the increase ofN . They can\nachieve the best performance offered by the pulse-shaping\nbased approach only using N = 20 blocks.\n5. CONCLUSIONS\nUtilizing the hidden pilots, this paper has proposed a novel\nCFO estimators for GMC-CDMA in unknown frequency-\nselective channels. It has been established that the CFO is\nidentifiable in the frequency-domain by employing the CS\nand LR-based approaches. Both theoretical and simulation\nresults have shown the excellent estimation performance of\nthe proposed CFO estimator.\n6. REFERENCES\n[1] Z. Wang, and G. B.
