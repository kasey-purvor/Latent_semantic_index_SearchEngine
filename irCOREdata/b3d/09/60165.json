Under  the  majority  of  situations\nminimal threat is posed to potable groundwater drinking supplies.\nKeywords: cattle slurry, aquifers, porewaters, groundwater, pathogens, contaminant modelling\nINTRODUCTION\nGroundwater provides over 30% of all water abstracted in England and Wales and accounts for  more  than\n80% of the total public supply in south-east England.  Both industry and agriculture rely on groundwater in\nmany  areas  and  it  is  the  predominant  source  for  private  water   supplies.   The   total   abstraction   of\ngroundwater in the UK, including that used by industry and agriculture, is some 2400 million m3 yr-1,  with\nthe majority of this coming from England. About 85% is pumped from two major aquifers,  the  Chalk  and\nthe Permo-Triassic Sandstone, which provide 60% and 25% of groundwater needs respectively.\nAlthough storage of livestock manure can present a serious potential risk of surface  water  pollution,  there\nhas not been the same concern about potential pollution  to  groundwater  possibly  because  of  the  greater\ndilution and less immediate impact  expected  in  groundwater  systems.  The  majority  of  livestock  slurry\nstorage structures generally only pose a risk of water  pollution  because  of  structural  or  operator  failure.\nOnly in the case of unlined earth-based  slurry  lagoons,  which  were  unregulated  before  1991,  and  field\nheaps of solid manure, is there a potential risk where they have been built on relatively permeable sites and\nleakage of pollutants through the base and walls may occur and cause pollution of groundwater (Withers et\nal. 1998).  Recent  observations  have  suggested  that  unlined  earth-banked  farm  slurry  stores  have  the\npotential to pose a threat to groundwater. There are  an  estimated  11,000  slurry  lagoons  in  England  and\nWales (Nicholson & Brewer 1997) many of which could  be  overlying  aquifers.  Data  from  a  single  site\nindicated that the slurry and its constituents might in some circumstances leach  from  the  bottom  of  these\nstores (Gooddy et al. 1998).  This study aims to investigate the extent of leaching under a wider  sample  of\nunlined earth-based slurry  stores  situated  over  aquifers  and  to  assess  the  risk  posed  to  potable  water\nsupplies at the catchment scale by using hydrological models.\nMETHODS\nSites\nSince all stores constructed after 1991 should have an impermeable base, field studies focussed on  unlined\nearth-based stores on permeable soils. Field sites were selected after extensive surveying in which some 68\npotential sites were considered for a  full  study.   In  all,  3 Chalk  and  5 Sandstone  sites  were  eventually\ninvestigated.   Details of the sites are shown in  Table  1.   At  each  of  these,  a  borehole  was  constructed\nadjacent to manure stores with the intention  of  sampling  the  interstitial  porewaters  and  so  identify  any\npollution from the store.  As all of the slurry stores were still in use, it was necessary  to  also  construct  an\ninclined  borehole  (generally  at  an  angle  of  45\u00b0)  at  each  site  so  as  to  obtain  material  from  directly\nunderneath the lagoon.  For all but one of the sites, continuous cores were obtained through the unsaturated\nzone by rotary coring using air as the lubricating  fluid.   At  Chalk  site  3  where  turkey  litter  was  stored\nabove ground on the bare surface of the Chalk, core  was  obtained  through  a  percussion  drilling  process\nwhere no lubricant was required.  These boreholes  were  constructed  vertically  just  after  the  annual  site\nclearance.\nSample extraction and analysis\nAt each borehole, core material was extracted, and examined visually for evidence  of  pollution  by  slurry.\nThe sample was then split into sections 1m long, porewater extracted for analysis as  soon  as  possible  and\nsamples taken for microbiological examination.\nPorewater was extracted by using the high speed centrifuge \u2018drainage\u2019  method  (Edmunds  &  Bath,  1976)\nand split into three fractions; one filtered and acidified for cations;  one  filtered  and  but  not  acidified  for\nanions; the other unfiltered and  not  acidified  for  dissolved  organic  carbon.   All  analyses  of  porewater\nsamples were carried  out  in  the  BGS  laboratories  at  Wallingford.   Filtered  acidified  porewaters  were\nanalysed using an ARL 34000C Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical  Emission  Spectrometer  (ICP-OES).\nNitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N), ammonium-nitrogen (NH4-N),  molybdate-reactive  phosphorus  (MRP)  and  Cl\nwere determined using standard Auto Analyser II colorimetric methods (Kinniburgh & Miles 1983) on  the\nfiltered, non acidified water fraction.\nCore material from the boreholes was sampled at approximately 5  m  vertical  intervals,  comminuted  and\nsuspensions were prepared using a wrist action shaker for 15 minutes.  The suspensions were examined  for\na  wide  range  of  micro-organisms  including  Cryptosprodium  oocysts  and  E.coli  O157:H7.    Standard\ntechniques were used and are detailed in Gooddy et al. (2000a).\nGas  samplers  were  installed  in  two  locations  (Chalk  site  2  and  Sandstone  site  1)  at  depths  of  2 m\nincrements  to  the  base  of  the  borehole.   These  were  made  from  short  lengths  of  plastic  waste  pipe\nperforated with 10 mm diameter holes at 30-40 mm centres and packed with glass wool to  prevent  ingress\nof the sand screening material.  After installation at the required depth, they  were  surrounded  with  coarse\nsand, and isolated from neighbouring samplers using a thick bentonite seal (Kinniburgh et al. 1999).\nModelling studies\nA model was developed to examine the balance  of  water  in  a  slurry  lagoon  subject  to  both  downward\nseepage, and time varying inputs.  This model predicts the water level in a slurry store as a function  of  the\nmass balance.  Using a daily time step, the amount of fluid in the store accumulates due to  the  addition  of\nmore material from  the  farm,  supplemented  by  daily  rainfall.   Water  is  removed  by  evaporation  and\nseepage.   The  seepage  through  the  bottom  of  the  store  was  calculated  using  the  Richards\u2019  equation\n(Marshall & Homes 1988)  for  saturated\/unsaturated  flow.   This  model  predicts  the  fluxes  through  the\nbottom of the store and through the base of the soil profile,  over  a  period  of  years.   It  was  used  with  a\nvariety of soil profile descriptions to identify the importance of the surface  sealing  layer,  and  to  estimate\nthe fluxes of water that would travel to the groundwater.\nAssuming leakage from a slurry store, further models were used to estimate the maximum concentration of\ncontaminant arriving at an abstraction well due to pollution  from  the  slurry  store.   Three  solutions  were\ndeveloped:\n1. A simple mass balance calculation based on recharge  rate,  abstraction  rate  and  of  the  capture  zone\narea.\n2. A groundwater flow model with particle tracking employed to define the position of  the  capture  zone\narea.\n3. An analytical transport model.\nThe  mass  balance  equation  was  used  to  provide  an  initial  model-independent  estimate  of   the   total\nconcentration reaching a well, which could later be used to check\/verify the  transport  model  results.   The\nanalytical model simulates flow  and  transport  along  a  series  of  streamtubes,  from  the  ground  surface\nthrough to output features where concentration predictions are required, in this case, from  slurry  stores  to\nabstraction wells. The particle tracking facility within the  flow  modelling  package  was  used  to  identify\nstreamtubes and their connection to surface zones.  Further consideration of the models is  provided  in  the\nsection \u2018Modelling Contaminant Movement\u2019.\nRESULTS: FIELD SITES\nTypical uncontaminated values of groundwater chemistry  in  the  Chalk  and  Sandstone  can  be  found  in\nTable 2. Cryptosporidium oocysts were found in slurry at Chalk sites 1 and 2, and Sandstone sites 2, 3  and\n5.  Slurry from the lagoon at Sandstone site 5 was also found to contain E.coli O157.\nChalk sites\nObservation of the core from Chalk site 1 showed visible slurry along  fractures  within  the  Chalk  matrix,\nwhich is reflected in the chemical results.  These demonstrated gross porewater  contamination  throughout\nthe depth of the two profiles with highest concentrations occurring below 10 m.  Bicarbonate  was  roughly\n10 times baseline concentrations and potassium nearly 2 orders of magnitude greater  than  baseline  (Table\n3).  Calcium concentrations were very low relative to baseline, nearly a factor of  10  lower  for  the  deeper\nporewaters from both boreholes.  DOC and ammonium concentrations were both very high, 2 and 3  orders\nof magnitude above  typical  baseline  values.   Microbiological  data  showed  high  total  clostridia  counts\nwhich  demonstrate  faecal  contamination  at  15 metres  below  ground  level  (mbgl)  but  the  absence  of\nE.coli and faecal enterococci suggests that this  occurred  some  considerable  time  before  sampling.   The\nconcentrations of  clostridia  were  fairly  similar  between  the  two  boreholes  with  the  vertical  borehole\nshowing greatest contamination.  Other pathogens such as E.coli  O157,  salmonella  and  Cryptosporidium\nparvum were absent.\nCores from Chalk site 2 also contained visible slurry along fracture planes, although to a lesser extent  than\nChalk site 1. This is reflected in the lower solute  concentrations  in  the  porewaters  (Table  3).   Clostridia\nwere present throughout both boreholes but at  lower  levels  than  Chalk  site  1  and  again  the  pathogens\nE.coli O157 and Cryptosporidium parvum were absent.\nPorewater concentrations for the borehole constructed through the centre of  the  turkey  litter  store,  Chalk\nsite 3, showed very high solute concentrations in the top part of the profile (Table 3).  These  are  up  to  50\ntimes the baseline groundwater concentration for chloride (3000 mg  l-1)  and  even  higher  for  ammonium\n(500 mg l-1),   potassium   (10,000   mg l-1)   and   dissolved   organic    carbon    (3000 mg l-1).     However,\nconcentrations declined rapidly with depth and were at baseline level at about 15 m.  The  top  8  porewater\nsamples were highly coloured, ranging from a \u2018crude oil\u2019 black in the top 50 cm,  through  \u2018whisky\u2019  brown\nand a \u2018pale straw\u2019 yellow by about 5 m.  Solute concentrations peaked at 3.5 m which may reflect  the  very\nslow movement of a contaminant front, travelling less  than  5  metres  in  20  years,  due  to  the  relatively\nimpermeable nature of the turkey litter to recharging  rainwater.  Porewaters  for  the  borehole  constructed\nthrough the edge of the litter showed more variable solute concentrations suggesting the loading of litter  at\nthis point had been less consistent.  Consequently nitrate-N and  ammonium-N  concentrations  were  much\nlower than in the other borehole (maxima of 70 mg l-1 and 25 mg l-1 respectively). Moisture  contents  were\ngenerally 5-10% higher than borehole 1 and may explain the large peak in nitrate concentration  around  10\nm.  Contamination can move more rapidly through the unsaturated zone in the areas not always covered by\na thick matting of litter.  With the exception of the top 50 cm, where low levels of clostridia  were  isolated,\nnone of the test micro-organisms was detected, supporting the chemical  analysis  by  indicating  very  slow\nmovement of the contaminant front.\nSandstone sites\nDuring the drilling in  the  Permo-Triassic  Sandstone  a  number  of  difficulties  were  encountered  in  the\nrecovery of core material and also the subsequent extraction of interstitial  waters.   Sandstones  are  highly\nvariable by their nature and the problems encountered included the material containing too much  clay;  the\nmaterial being too soft; the material  being  too  dry;  and  the  material  being  interspersed  with  layers  of\ngravel.  Results of the porewater extractions that could be carried out are shown in Table 4.\nSandstone site 1 is predominantly mudstone and water yields were correspondingly low, typically around 2-\n3% ranging from 0.3 to 7%.  Due to the  low  recovered  volumes,  only  a  few  samples  have  a  complete\nelemental analysis.  Both inclined and vertical profiles followed a similar trend with highest concentrations\nof chloride beneath the solid manure store.  Nitrate concentrations were similar beneath both stores.  Water\nfrom the farm borehole had a conductivity of 555 \u00b5S cm-1, chloride  concentration  38 mg l-1  and  nitrate-N\nconcentration 8.2 mg l-1.  Nitrate concentrations in the store boreholes were therefore roughly half those  in\nthe   farm   borehole.    Limited   ammonium   data   showed   concentrations   averaging   0.03 mg l-1    and\n0.01 mg l-1 beneath the solid  and  liquid  stores.   No  microbial  contamination  was  found  in  any  of  the\nextracted cores. The inference of  similar  concentrations  in  each  pair  of  boreholes  is  that  leakage  was\noccurring from the bottom and sides of both stores. The higher conductivity values in the vertical hole than\nin the inclined hole suggests leakage was occurring at a slightly  greater  rate  from  the  sides  of  the  solid\nmanure store.  This may have been due to some sealing of the store bottom, which has not  occurred  at  the\nsides.\nFor the \u2018whole\u2019 profile of Sandstone site 2, concentrations of chloride and nitrate-N were  roughly  3  times\nhigher than the baseline chemical composition although concentrations in the profile below 10 m are lower.\n This implies that the lagoon   has  an  influence  over  the  chemistry  of  the  immediate  unsaturated  zone\nalthough this is likely to be small at the catchment scale.  It is  likely  that  the  comparatively  small  solids\ncontent of the liquid slurry store has not been able to form a very effective seal at  the  base  of  the  lagoon.\nThe lack of  any  ammonium  suggested  that  the  environment  is  strongly  oxidising.   Concentrations  of\nchloride and nitrate-N in the porewaters obtained from beneath the solid slurry store are significantly lower\nthan beneath the solid store and close to baseline suggesting little or  no  movement  of  slurry  components\nfrom the store through the aquifer.  Dissolved organic carbon concentrations are surprisingly high but  may\nreflect the organic content of  the  underlying  carboniferous  rocks.   Microbiological  samples  from  cores\ntaken beneath both stores on this site showed no evidence of any microbial contamination.\nSandstone site 3 is a short term store which is scraped clear every 2-3 days.  Porewaters obtained from  this\nsite were a straw yellow colour with a strong odour.  The degree of contamination increased throughout the\ndrilled length of the borehole partly as a result of drilling at an angle of just 8\u00b0 due to local obstructions,  so\nthe middle of the store was not crossed until the borehole  was  12  m  deep.   For  operational  reasons,  the\nborehole was not constructed beyond 18 m so the extent to which contamination had  penetrated  was  hard\nto estimate.  Below 10 m, chloride and ammonium concentrations were similar to levels found beneath  the\nheavily contaminated Chalk  sites  1  and  2.  Conductivity  and  chloride  concentration  were  an  order  of\nmagnitude higher than baseline.  The near-absence of nitrate suggests highly  reducing  conditions  beneath\nand around the store and the dissolved organic carbon concentrations were considerably higher than  at  the\nother sites.  Acidic conditions (pH <6) were present in contrast to the contaminated Chalk sites which were\nall basic (pH >8).  Also in contrast to the Chalk sites concentrations of both iron and especially  manganese\nwere very high.  In addition, concentrations of arsenic were found up to  1  mg l-1.   Surprisingly  microbial\nexamination of the core material revealed little by way of microorganisms. Faecal enterococci  were  found\nin the first sample (down to a depth of 2.5 m) and clostridia were found in limited numbers down  to  about\n7 m, suggesting unsaturated Sandstone is acting as a very efficient filter.\nDue to the very poor core recovery from Sandstone site 4 only a few samples could be taken and there  was\ninsufficient sample for any microbiological examination.  The water table was reached at about 18 m and it\nis significant that porewaters had lower solute concentrations below this depth.  The high concentrations of\nammonium raise some concerns, although the concomitant lack of DOC suggests this  may  not  be  due  to\nslurry infiltration.\nPorewater profiles for Sandstone site 5 showed solute concentrations which are slightly elevated  compared\nto baseline but not to any significant degree, especially for farmland.   Microbial  examination  of  the  core\nmaterial however, only revealed  a  very  small  number  of  clostridia  present  in  the  top  12  m  with  the\nindicator pathogens absent.\nGas samplers\nA previous study under agricultural grassland (Kinniburgh et al. 1999)  has  shown  that  gas  samplers  can\ntake up to 12 months to re-equilibrate with the unsaturated zone environment following  installation.   Data\nfor Sandstone site 1 however showed little seasonal variation. Oxygen concentrations were consistently 9%\nlower than baseline data (Darling et  al.1997)  although  carbon  dioxide  concentrations  were  roughly  the\nsame.  Nitrous oxide (N2O) concentrations were about an  order  of  magnitude  higher  than  baseline,  and\ncoupled with the elevated nitrogen to argon ratio (average  of  84.46 ( 0.52)  data  suggest  some  biological\nactivity and limited denitrification.\nChalk  site  2  exhibited  a  radically  different  gas  chemistry  relative  to  baseline.  The  act   of   borehole\nconstruction and the inevitable introduction of atmospheric air had a significant impact on both oxygen and\nmethane concentrations.  However, carbon dioxide concentrations remained remarkably  similar  from  one\nsampling to the next with a peak concentration of 23%  at  17 mbgl.   Concentrations  of  oxygen  fell  from\n10% at 15 mbgl  to  <1%  from  the  first  (176  days  after  installation)  to  last  sampling  (569  days  after\ninstallation).  Concentrations of methane at depth  increased  by  five  orders  of  magnitude  from  the  first\nsampling to the second (>10% methane), with the concentration of methane found at 17 mbgl  of  the  same\norder  of  magnitude  as  that  found  in  landfill  sites.   By  the  third   round   of   sampling,   the   methane\nconcentration had fallen to below 1%.  High concentration of methane at  depth  indicate  that  considerable\nmicrobial activity was still on-going.  Significantly, the ?13C-CO2   ratio  did  not  change  during  the  large\nchange in methane concentrations.  The high microbial activity is reflected in  a  high  nitrogen\/argon  ratio\nwhich,  for  samplers  deeper  than  7 mbgl  sampled  after  428  and  569  days,  averaged  90.5 ( 4.9.    The\nmaximum  N2O concentration occurred  around  10 mbgl,  although  the  peak  in  the  nitrogen\/argon  ratio\noccurred around 15 mbgl, concurrent with a minimum of N2O.  At this point a large enrichment of  the  15N\nisotope is also found (Figure 1).\nImplications of field site results\nThe self-sealing of unlined slurry and manure stores by solids present in the slurry is seen as a  crucial  step\nin minimising leakage and consequent groundwater contamination.   It  is  important  for  unlined  facilities\nthat good practice is carried out during emptying so that any seal, once formed, is not broken. Where a seal\nhas formed early on in the lifetime of a slurry store, limited leakage occurs and  there  is  sufficient  oxygen\npresent in the unsaturated zone of  the  aquifer  to  allow  the  oxidation  of  ammonium  to  nitrate  and  the\nefficient oxidation of organic carbon to carbon dioxide. Where a store fails to seal or the  seal  is  poor,  the\nammonium remains unoxidised and migrates in this form.  Field  data  tend  to  suggest  that  stores  do  not\nform such good seals on the side walls and some seepage is able to occur through this route.\nAt Chalk site 2, although a good seal is believed to have occurred, subsurface environmental conditions are\nsufficiently reducing for denitrification to occur with the subsequent removal of a large  component  of  the\nnitrate.  The nitrate loading to groundwater is therefore  considerably  decreased  although  further  detailed\nstudy would be required to more accurately determine denitrification rates.  Where no seal  or  a  poor  seal\nhas formed, such as  Chalk  site  1  and  Sandstone  site  3,  conditions  become  more  reducing,  with  high\nconcentrations of organic carbon  and  ammonium  persisting.   Indeed,  there  is  evidence  to  suggest  that\nsulphate  reduction  is  taking  place  at  Chalk  site  1  (Gooddy  et  al.  2000b).   In  the   Chalk   sites,   the\ngeochemical reactions taking place can often be buffered by  the  calcium  carbonate  based  Chalk  matrix.\nHowever, in Permo-Triassic Sandstones little calcium carbonate is present which can lead to a fall in pH as\nammonium is oxidised to nitrate.  This combined with a reducing environment can lead to the  mobilisation\nof metals present in the Sandstone matrix.\nThe  detection  of  clostridia  in  many  of  the  microbiological  results  confirm  the  presence  of  reducing\nconditions beneath the slurry stores.  At all sites the movement of contamination appears to be slow,  which\nsuggests that the risks of any pathogens  present  in  the  store  manure  entering  the  groundwater  through\nmatrix flow are small.  However, the presence of fractures and the observation of  slurry  on  fracture  faces\nsuggests a rapid route for otherwise short lived pathogens to  reach  groundwater,  especially  in  the  in  the\nearly years of lagoon operation or after refilling following emptying.\nMODELLING CONTAMINANT MOVEMENT\nUnsaturated zone modelling: estimates of fluxes through a slurry store\nFluxes through the unsaturated  zone  were  estimated  using  the  Richards\u2019  equation  coupled  to  a  water\nbalance model to define both depth of water in the store and the flow through the  bottom  of  the  store.   It\nwas assumed that the store was designed to hold 6 months production of slurry at a daily rate of addition of\n0.01 m d-1 and was therefore set to be 2 m deep.\nThe hydraulic properties were based on the  description  of  the  unmodified  geological  material  given  by\nAllen  et  al.  (1997).   Median  values  for  the  Permo-Triassic  Sandstone  were  used,  with   a   hydraulic\nconductivity of 0.56 m d-1 and a porosity of  26%.  Values  for  the  Chalk  are  more  difficult  to  estimate,\nbecause of  the  observation  that  hydraulic  conductivity  measured  in  boreholes  is  at  least  an  order  of\nmagnitude greater than that measured in the matrix.  The median conductivity of the Chalk matrix is  6.3  x\n10-4 m d-1, so a value an order of magnitude greater (6.3 x 10-3 m d-1) was used for the fracture system.\nThe hydraulic conductivity of the  contaminated  layers  at  the  base  of  the  store  were  more  difficult  to\nestimate.  Studies by Owens (no date) and other workers (Barrington et al. 1987) demonstrated a  reduction\nof hydraulic conductivity of the order of 94-98%.\nIn order to investigate the effect of sealing, four layered soil scenarios were created and are summarised  in\nTable 5.  One, two or three layers were used to represent the sealed  layer.  Their  conductivities  were  one,\ntwo or three orders of magnitude smaller than that  of  the  unsealed  geological  material.  In  addition,  the\nmodel was  used  to  estimate  the  possible  magnitude  of  the  macropore  flow  component  in  the  Chalk\n(scenarios M1-M4)\nThe results showed that, for each of these scenarios, an equilibrium flux was established within 2 years.   It\nwas also clear that the major component of the flux was the daily addition of water to the store in  the  form\nof slurry, and any impact of rainfall and evaporation was secondary.\nThe model demonstrates the importance of the sealed layer. In the Permo-Triassic Sandstone:\n1. Without the sealed layer (scenario P4) or with only a thin sealing layer (P3) the  slurry  store  acts  as  a\nsoak-away.\n2. A sealing layer with a conductivity of 1% of the initial value decreases fluxes to no more than about  2-\n3 times the natural recharge  (i.e. 450 mm yr-1 as opposed to about 200 mm yr-1).\n3. Only with a thin surface layer having a conductivity 3  orders  of  magnitude  lower  than  the  unsealed\nmaterial (P1) did the flux become less than the natural recharge.\nThe pattern within the Chalk  (scenarios  C1  to  C4)  is  very  similar  to  that  in  the  Sandstone,  although\nnumerically smaller.  Without a sealing layer  (Scenario C4), the movement across the store  surface  could\neven be in both directions, as summer evaporation induces upwards movement of water.\nMass balance model\nThe results from the mass balance model are summarised in Table 6. If the abstraction rate is large  (>1000\nm3 d-1), then the mass flow rate of a water soluble pollutant such as nitrate from the slurry store  is  a  small\nproportion of that derived from rainfall recharge.  Dilution is therefore high  and  the  impact  of  the  slurry\nstore on the concentration at the well is negligible.  However, the contribution of  pollutant  mass  from  the\nslurry store to the concentration at the well becomes more significant when the abstraction rate is small.   If\nthe proportion of volumetric flow  from  the  slurry  store  is  large  with  respect  to  rainfall  recharge  then\ndilution of the contaminants is low.  This analysis suggested that the danger from contamination by  soluble\npollutants is only of concern at a small abstraction supply near the slurry  store,  such  as  a  farm  borehole,\nand this danger is exacerbated by low rates of rainfall recharge.  However, it must be emphasised  that  this\nanalysis is for a dissolved (non-particulate) contaminant that travels with the recharge water.  Additionally,\nthis analysis gives no measure of travel times and so cannot  be  used  as  a  relevant  indicator  of  bacterial\ncontamination.   Naturally,  if  the  contaminant  is  highly  toxic  and   has   a   low   maximum   admissible\nconcentration in groundwater, even the small increases in concentration for  the  larger  abstractions  shown\nin Table 6 might be significant.\nNumerical modelling\nFollowing the mass balance work, some simple models were developed using a finite difference  numerical\ngroundwater flow model, MODFLOW (McDonald & Harbaugh 1988), to investigate the  likelihood  that  a\nslurry store would be within the catchment area of a farm borehole. Using Chalk site 2 as  an  example,  the\nmodel was set-up to produce groundwater gradients similar to those on the regional  hydrogeological  map.\nThis was done by using values of recharge rate, hydraulic conductivity and river  leakage  within  a  typical\nrange for a Chalk aquifer (Table 7). Once satisfactory  gradients  were  obtained,  an  abstraction  well  was\nintroduced to the model, and the capture  zone  of  the  well  was  determined  using  MODPATH  (Pollock\n1989). The capture zone for a well likely to be used for  farm  supply  (10  m3 d-1)  was  shown  to  be  very\nnarrow, having a width of less than  10  m.  As  it  would  be  very  unlikely  that  a  slurry  store  would  be\npositioned within this 10 m wide  zone  it  appears  that  the  risk  of  groundwater  contaminated  by  slurry\nreaching such a well is low.\nThis conclusion is based on modelling at  one  site.   In  regions  with  lower  hydraulic  gradients  or  lower\ntransmissivities the width of the capture zone will be greater, thus increasing the possibility that  the  slurry\nstore will be in  the  capture  zone  of  the  borehole.   Thus  it  is  important  that  such  supplies  are  tested\nperiodically if they are used for human consumption.\nTravel times\nThe travel time of pollution  from  a  slurry  store  to  an  abstraction  point  is  important  if  pathogens  are\nconsidered.  The site based MODFLOW model can be used to give an indication of travel times within  the\naquifer if an effective porosity is known. The time of travel from a farm manure store to a nearby  borehole\nis summarised in Table 8.\nThe assumptions used for these estimates are\n1. Solute travels through the unsaturated zone at the rate of 1 m yr-1 (based on an average  value  for\nunsaturated flow in the Chalk of southern England,  Wellings 1984).\n2. Saturated flow in Chalk can be represented by a porous medium with a porosity of 1%.\nThese results clearly demonstrate that, for the  likely  distance  from  a  livestock  manure  store  to  a  farm\nsupply borehole (<1 km), the time for the contaminants to pass through the unsaturated zone  is  far  greater\nthan the travel time in the saturated zone. This demonstrates the importance  of  characterising  unsaturated\nzone processes for determining the impact of  agricultural  pollution  on  groundwater  quality.  Also,  these\ncalculations of the time taken to travel through the unsaturated\/saturated zones means that, even  if  the  use\nof existing unlined farm manure stores is discontinued, then there is a significant time (~10s  years)  before\nthis affects water quality at nearby abstractions. Where a very shallow unsaturated zone exists the  potential\nrisk to groundwater is greater than a deep unsaturated zone since direct hydraulic connectivity between  the\nbase of the lagoon and the water table is more likely to be made.  For pathogens that might  have  relatively\nshort lifespans in the subsurface this could be of great significance, since transit  times  from  store  to  well\nwould be greatly reduced.\nImpact on large abstractions of removing unlined slurry stores\nBoth Sandstone and Chalk public water supply abstractions show large short-term  variations  in  measured\nnitrate concentrations (Chilton et al. 1999). These have proved to be very  difficult  to  model.  However,  a\nregional numerical model combined with analytical transport modelling has been used to identify  the  long\nterm trends and so predict the effects of management changes  (Chilton et  al. 1999).   As  an  example,  the\neffects of discontinuing the use of manure stores in the year  2000  for  a  Sandstone  and  a  Chalk  site  are\nshown in Figures 2 and 3.  These figures do not represent likely long term changes  in  groundwater  nitrate\nconcentrations  on  a  national  basis,  but  demonstrate  trends  for  an  abstraction  borehole  in   the   same\ncatchment as a leaking slurry store. The results show concentrations still  rise  with  the  removal  of  slurry\nstores as residual contamination in the aquifer remains.  There  is  a  negligible  effect  on  predicted  nitrate\nconcentrations (less than 0.1 mg l-1 after 20 years) due to the large dilution effects involved and in the  case\nof the Chalk (Figure 3) the effect of discontinuing use is even smaller as a result of the dual porosity nature\nof the saturated Chalk aquifer.\nImplications of modelling study\nThe results of these studies show that travel times within the aquifer system, from store to the  groundwater\ntable and then to an abstraction point are relatively long.  Where a seal has been formed, transport from  the\nstore to the water table is at a maximum velocity of  around  1 m yr-1,  which  gives  travel  times  of  many\nyears  at  most  sites.   Without  the  sealed  layer,  the  slurry  store  can  act  as  a  soak-away  as  hydraulic\nconnectivity is reached between the base of the store and the water table. This  may  also  occur  where  the\nunsaturated zone is very shallow. Within the  aquifer  itself  the  travel  times  from  the  water  table  to  an\nabstraction point obviously depend on the distance, but are generally measured in years rather than days.  It\nis therefore important to  characterise  the  thickness  of  the  unsaturated  zone  and  likely  travel  times  of\npollutants from a slurry store to the water table.\nConsideration of the nitrate concentrations in the leachate from the stores leads to the  conclusion  that  this\nposes little additional risk to the quality of abstracted water, unless the  abstraction  is  small  and  is  in  the\nimmediate vicinity of the store. However, the work has concentrated on consideration  of  nitrate,  which  is\nalso present in the environment from many  other  agricultural  sources.   Other  possible  pollutants  which\nbehave in a different way, in particular micro-organisms such as Cryptosporidium parvum,  have  not  been\nmodelled.  Such pollutants travel in different pathways to dissolved pollutants as they are often too large to\naccess all the pore space. From the modelling work reported here it was not possible to identify  their  rates\nof movement without additional laboratory and field studies.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe field studies showed contamination of the unsaturated zone  at  two  of  the  Chalk  sites  and  provided\nevidence  for  slurry  movement  along  fractures  in  the  Chalk.   Dark  staining  along  fracture  faces  was\nobserved to depths of at least 15 m below ground level.  The age of the slurry  on  these  fractures  was  not\ndetermined and so it is unclear as to whether or not this is an relict of a lagoons\u2019 initial  filling  after  which\nthe fractures became effectively  sealed,  or  represents  a  continual  source  of  raw  slurry  throughout  the\nunsaturated zone and beyond.  Little movement of solutes was observed in the  Sandstone  sites  except  for\nsite 3 where the base of  the  store  was  regularly  scraped  clear.  There  is  strong  evidence  for  microbial\nreduction of organic carbon at the most contaminated Chalk sites.\nAlthough  some  micro-organisms  were  detected  in  the  unsaturated  zone  beneath  many  of  the   stores\ninvestigated, none of these were pathogens, even though pathogens were found to be present  in  the  slurry\nlagoons themselves.  This is an encouraging finding although it should be taken in  the  context  of  a  small\nsubsample of the total number of unlined slurry lagoons.\nThe results from both field studies and contaminant modelling suggest  that  in  the  majority  of  situations,\nunlined earth-based slurry stores pose little  threat  to  potable  groundwater  drinking  supplies.   The  store\nrepresents a relatively small point source of contamination in the very large water  body  of  a  groundwater\ncatchment, hence there is a high potential for dilution.  However, the potential for contamination of  a  farm\nborehole is much greater than that of a public drinking supply although risk of interception  of  pollution  is\nlower.  The siting of wells for drinking and other agricultural purposes should be up  groundwater  gradient\nfrom the lagoon source.  Contaminant modelling has also shown that discontinuing use of an  unlined  farm\nmanure store will make little difference to the increase in concentration of nitrate in  a  catchment  over  the\nshort to medium term and may not palliate the relatively small pollution threat.\nThe travel time for a contaminant between the farm manure store and abstraction is likely to  be  controlled\nby the unsaturated zone.  Where there is direct hydraulic connection between the lagoon base and the water\ntable,  contaminant  travel  times  to  reach  groundwater  and  potential  potable  water  supplies  would  be\nconsiderably reduced.  This is of greatest significance for pathogens that are thought to  be  relatively  short\nlived in the subsurface.  It is therefore deduced that the highest risk category  for  an  unlined  farm  manure\nstore would be in an area where the aquifer has no drift cover and the water table is shallow.  The  Chalk  is\nparticularly vulnerable due to its fractured nature allowing rapid vertical flow.\nThis study has focused on the impacts of earth-banked slurry stores which  are  unlined  and  overlying  the\ntwo  principal  aquifers  in  England  and  Wales,  the  Chalk  and  Permo-Triassic  Sandstone.   Stores  thus\nsituated are generally accepted as the farm manure facilities most likely  to  pose  a  threat  to  groundwater\nquality.  Few resources have been directed at solid manure heaps and these are not governed by regulations\nin the same way as unlined slurry  lagoons.   It  is  felt  that  the  risk  to  groundwater  from  solid  heaps  is\nminimal due to the relatively impermeable and high dry matter content of the manure, but  further  work  is\nneeded on this issue.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis work has been undertaken with funding from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.
