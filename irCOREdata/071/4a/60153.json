In the United States, a considerable body of work exists relating to the occurrence  of\nboth parent compound pesticides and their metabolites in aquifers (Thurman et al., 1992; Baker  et\nal., 1993; Lawrence et al., 1993; Kolpin et al., 1996;  Kolpin  et  al.,  1998;  Kolpin  et  al.,  2000a;\nKolpin et al., 2000b).  In  the  UK  the  number  of  field  studies  has  been  limited  (Clark  et  al.,\n1991;Gooddy et al., 2001; Johnson et al., 2001) with researchers often concentrating on laboratory\nstudies of transport and degradation potential (Johnson et al., 1998; Besien et al., 2000; Johnson et\nal., 2000).\nThe major aquifer in the UK, the Cretaceous Chalk, is a soft microporous and fractured  calcium  carbonate\ncommonly overlain by thin (<1 metre) calcareous soils. It is a complex natural system and  consequently  is\nvery difficult to measure or sample in a systematic manner.  Once  a  pesticide  enters  the  chalk  rock,  the\npotential for biodegradation is substantially reduced (Johnson  et  al.,  2000).  With  effect  from  December\n2003,  the  European  Union  Drinking  Water  Directive  (Council  Directive  98\/83\/EC)  has  set  limits  of\n0.03 \u00b5g\/L for certain pesticides. Under the Directive there  is  currently  no  requirement  for  water  supply\norganisations to measure pesticide metabolites despite evidence that their toxicity  can  be  higher  than  the\nparent  compound  (Tixier  et  al.,  2000;  Tixier  et  al.,  2001).There  is  a  clear  need  therefore,  to  better\nunderstand the movement and transport of pesticides and their degradation products  in  both  the  thin  soil\nzone, where most retardation and degradation is likely to take place, and in the aquifer itself.  In  this  study\nwe have applied  diuron  and  bromide,  as  a  conservative  tracer,  to  a  trial  site.  By  improving  existing\nanalytical methods we have made a series of field measurements to determine the movement and  transport\nof both diuron and its metabolites under normal herbicide application rates and environmental conditions.\nDiuron (N\u2018-[3,4-dichlorophenyl]-N,N-dimethylurea) is a substituted urea herbicide used to  control  a  wide\nvariety of annual and perennial broadleaf and grassy weeds. It is used on many  agricultural  crops  such  as\nfruit, cotton, sugar cane, alfalfa, and wheat but is more widely applied for  long-term  pre-emergence  weed\ncontrol in non-crop areas (Tomlin, 1994) especially along railway lines (Schweinsberg et al., 1999). It  may\nbe found in formulations as wettable powders  and  suspension  concentrates.  Diuron  works  by  inhibiting\nphotosynthesis. It is relatively persistent in soil, with half -lives from 1 month to 1  year  (Wauchope  et  al,\n1992). Its persistence in soil is due  to  a  combination  of  three  properties:  chemical  stability,  low  water\nsolubility  and  strong  adsorption  to   soil   particles   (Walker   and   Jurado-Exposito,   1998).   Microbial\ndegradation is considered to be the primary mechanism for its dissipation  from  soil  (Tixier  et  al.,  2000).\nUnder well oxygenated conditions, this is believed to occur by successive demethylation of the  urea  group\nfollowed by hydrolysis to produce  a  chlorinated  aniline  (Figure  1).  The  metabolites  are  generally  less\nmobile than the parent compound (Howard, 1991).\nMethods\nField Site and Sampling\nThe field site is situated near Wallingford, UK (NGR 46141898, 1\u00b006\u2019 W  51\u00b036\u2019  N)  (Figure  2).\nThe site lies 250 m west of the topographical gradient  change  indicating  the  start  of  the  Lower\nChalk and is situated over 1st (Flood Plain) Terrace deposits of Younger River Gravels  in  the  valley  of\nthe River Thames. The soil is roughly 60 cm thick and is typical of brown calcareous earths of the Coombe\n2 series (Avery, 1980), although near to the boundary of the argillic brown earths of the Sutton 2 series. No\nprevious pesticide applications have been made for at least 30 years and the land is left  under  grass,  being\nregularly cut during the summer months.\nTo investigate the in situ degradation and  mobility  of  diuron  we  devised  a  small  experimental  plot  as\nshown in  Figure  3.  The  plot  comprises  a  3x3  m  grid  with  a  small,  5  m  deep  observation  borehole\nconstructed towards its northern end.  On the 9th January 2001 at 11.30 am, a solution containing  6.03 g  of\nan agricultural grade of a commercially available form of diuron, Karmex( (Du Pont chemicals), and 180  g\nof KBr in 9 litres of Wallingford tap water (approximately pH 7) was prepared in a clean 10 L watering can\nand applied to the plot by hand.  The concentration of diuron applied is equivalent to 6.7 kg\/ha which is the\nmaximum recommended application rate.  The KBr application is equivalent to 200 kg\/ha or 134  kg\/ha  of\nBr and was applied to act as a conservative tracer of the downward flux of water.\nPrecipitation was measured by a local rainfall collector situated roughly 50 m from  the  experimental  plot.\nFigure 4 shows the distribution of rainfall that occurred during the 50 day monitoring period. A total of 109\nmm fell on the 26 days when rainfall occurred. On 19 occasions daily rainfall exceeded 1 mm. No rain  fell\non the day of application. During the complete period of January-February 2001 a total of 129.2 mm fell in\nthe area, this compares with a 20 year median for the site of 96.3 mm which suggests this part of the winter\nwas wetter than normal.\nSoil profiles down to 54 cm were obtained with an Edelman (Dutch) auger.  Samples  were  taken  every  9\ncm and profiles were taken in duplicate with equivalent  depths  mixed  in  a  polythene  bag.  Groundwater\nsamples were taken at the same time from  the  observation  borehole  by  using  a  small,  battery  powered\nsubmersible pump. The groundwater at the  site  is  comparatively  shallow,  varying  between  1.00 m  and\n1.40 m. Samples for both soil profiles and groundwater were taken after 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, and 50 days.\nIn the laboratory approximately 300 g of soil from each of the samples were loaded  into  the  buckets  of  a\nsix arm JA 14 fixed angle rotor in a refrigerated Beckman  J2-21  high  speed  centrifuge.   Specially  made\nDelrin liners with collection cups and pre-filters held the soil in  the  centrifuge  rotor.   The  samples  were\ncentrifuged at 14,000 rpm (equivalent to a driving force of about 1.7 MPa) for 35 minutes at  4\u00b0C,  and  the\npore water was extracted using the centrifuge drainage method (Edmunds and Bath, 1976).  Great care was\ntaken to avoid contamination and to minimize evaporation.  Pore waters were extracted on the same day  as\nsoil sampling. During the first sampling exercise the  resultant  porewaters  were  divided  into  4  fractions:\n4ml 0.45 \u00b5m-filtered and unacidified for anions (including the  bromide  tracer);  5ml  0.45\u00b5m-filtered  and\nacidified for cations;  4ml  unfiltered  and  unacidified  for  dissolved  organic  carbon  (DOC);  and  10  ml\nunfiltered and unacidified for diuron and its metabolites.   For  subsequent  sampling  the  porewaters  were\nsplit into just 2 fractions: 2ml unfiltered and unacidified for bromide  and  a  minimum  of  10ml  unfiltered\nand unacidified for diuron and metabolites. The centrifuged soil residues were preserved in a refrigerator at\n4\u00b0C for 1 day prior to extraction by methanol and subsequent analysis  for  diuron  and  metabolites.  These\nresidues represent diuron and metabolites that are sorbed to the soil surface.\nSoil Characterisation and Chemical Analysis\nFiltered acidified porewaters were analysed using an Perkin Elmer  Optima  3300DV  Inductively  Coupled\nPlasma-Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES)  which  is  calibrated  using  standard  solutions  for  the\nfollowing 19 elements: Na, K, Ca, Mg, B, Ba, Ptotal,, SO4, Si, Sr, Zn, Cd, Cu, Co, Cr,  Ni,  Mn  ,  Fetotal  and\nAl. All analyses were blank corrected and detection limits defined as 6 times the standard deviation  of  the\nblank. Nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N), ammonium-nitrogen (NH4-N),  and  Cl  were  determined  using  standard\nAuto Analyser II colorimetric methods (Kinniburgh and  Miles,  1983)  on  the  filtered,  unacidified  water\nfraction.  Nitrate-nitrogen  was  determined  by  the  cadmium  column  reduction  method  since  the   high\ndissolved  organic  carbon  content  of  the  samples  can  cause  suppression   of   the   baseline   when   the\nhydrazine\/copper reduction method is used. Bromide was measured on a separate sample and analysed by a\nbromide ion selective electrode. pH was measured with a glass  micro  electrode  and  bicarbonate  (HCO3)\ndetermined with an automated Radiometer titrator. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was measured  on  the\nunacidified, unfiltered sample with a TOCSIN II  aqueous carbon analyser. Analyses were verified  against\nstandard reference materials.\nChemical characterisation of the solid phase was carried  out  by  using  a  weak  nitric  acid  solution.  The\nefficacy of this method for providing data on exchangeable cations in sandy acid soils has  previously  been\ndemonstrated (Boekhold et al., 1993) and has a number of benefits over more specific extractants  (Gooddy\net al., 1995). In calcareous soils the extractant  will  considerably  overstate  the  exchangeable  base  cation\nconcentration but still provides useful information on other elements present. Five grams of  dry  soil  from\neach 9 cm interval were placed into a pre-weighed 250  ml  Oak  Ridge  polypropylene  centrifuge  tube  to\nwhich was added 50 ml of 0.43 M HNO3 (Analytical  Reagent  grade).  The  tubes  were  shaken  on  a  box\nshaker for 2 hours before centrifuging for 10 min at  14,000 rpm.  The  coloured  supernatant  liquids  were\nthen filtered through 0.45 \u00b5m filters prior to analysis by ICP-OES as above. All extractions were performed\nin duplicate.\nTotal organic carbon of the solid phase was determined by a Carlo Erba NA1500 CNS analyser fitted  with\na Porapak column operated isothermally at 70\u00b0C.\nDiuron and Metabolite Analysis\nInitial HPLC method development was based on a previously published method (Field  et  al.,  1997).   The\nmethod involved the separation of diuron and  its  metabolites  on  a  base-deactivated  reversed-phase  C18\nSupelco LC18-DB column. However, in contrast to Field and coworkers, it was found that gradient  elution\nwas not necessary to  provide  good  chromatography.   Preliminary  experiments  using  solutions  of  pure\ndiuron  and  pure  metabolites  (QMx  Laboratories,  Saffron  Walden,  UK),  in  conjunction  with   various\nisocratic compositions of a simple binary mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile and water, resulted  in  the\nformulation of an optimum mobile phase composition of 35%  acetonitrile  :  65%  water.   Chromatograms\nproduced with this gave retention times of ca. 8 mins. for DCPU, ca. 11 mins. for DCPMU, ca. 14 mins for\ndiuron and ca. 20 mins. for DCA.   Detection  was  conducted  with  a  sensitive  UV\/Vis  detector  (Waters\n2487) set at 252 nm.  By using a large sample introduction loop of 1 ml  capacity  a  detection  limit  in  the\nregion of 50 ng\/L was achieved. Good detection limits on small volumes of sample is crucial  to  this  study\ndue to the serious time penalty of  centrifuging  large  masses  of  soil  to  obtain  enough  water  for  a  pre-\nconcentration step. Small sample size also meant that many samples  could  be  taken  from  the  study  plot\nwithout causing the serious disruption to the site that shallow coring using a drilling rig would cause.\nA 2 mg\/L aqueous solution of the commercial agrochemical form of  diuron  (Karmex)  was  prepared  and\nanalysed by HPLC.  The chromatograms obtained indicated that the formulation contained 84% weight  for\nweight (w\/w) diuron (compared with 80% stated by the manufacturer) together  with  0.1%  w\/w  DCPMU,\n0.1% w\/w DCA and 0.01% w\/w DCPU.\nPorewater was analysed directly by injection of 1 ml onto the HPLC system. On  completion  of  an  HPLC\nanalysis the column  was  backflushed  with  80%  aqueous  acetonitrile  to  remove  any  strongly  retained\nmaterials that might otherwise elute on later runs with possibly deleterious effects on peak quantification.\nFor the soil samples, roughly 200 g of a given post-centrifuged soil was transferred  into  a  conical  beaker\nand accurately weighed.  To this was added twice as much methanol by weight. The mixture was  carefully\nstirred with a large palette-knife type spatula which was also used to breakdown large soil aggregates.  The\nbeakers and their contents were then placed in a heated ultrasonic  bath  (40\u00baC)  and  sonicated  at  intervals\nover a 24 h period.  Further stirring with the spatula was performed intermittently over a 24 h  period.   The\ncontents of each beaker were then transferred to a Buchner funnel and  filtered  through  Whatman  No.  41\nfilter paper.  The residue was rinsed with methanol  and  the  filtrate  was  reduced  in  volume  on  a  rotary\nevaporator until the methanol had been removed.  The resulting mainly aqueous  suspension  was  made  to\nan appropriate volume with pure water, sonicated and a 1 ml volume injected  through  the  HPLC  system.\nAgain a post-run backflushing  regime  was  employed  to  preserve  the  column  and  avoid  quantification\nartefacts.\nResults\nPorewaters\nMajor ion data from the porewater profile sampled 8 days after diuron and bromide  application  is\npresented  in  Table  1.  The  predominance  of  calcium  and  bicarbonate  ions   demonstrate   the\nporewaters to be of a calcium carbonate type. Nitrate concentrations are above EU drinking  water\nstandard and considered high when compared with those found beneath non agricultural grassland\n(Campbell et al., 1989). This may reflect some post-war agricultural activity on the land  although\nany such activity is very unlikely to have involved  application  of  diuron  or  similarly  structured\nherbicide.  The  high  concentration  of  potassium  and  chloride  in  the  top  9   cm   reflects   the\napplication of KBr, with chloride present as a trace impurity present in the reagent. The pH of  the\nsoil solution averages 8.02 which is indicative of mildly alkaline conditions.\nExtractions\nData for the solid phase chemistry are presented in Table  2  for  the  weak  nitric  acid  extractable\ncations. For most elements a clear trend of decreasing concentration with depth  can  be  observed.\nThe exceptions to this are the concentrations of  calcium  and  strontium,  both  of  which  increase\nwith depth. The calcium values are erroneously high and do not reflect extractable  cations  as  the\ncalcium has been dissolved from the soil matrix. This is likely to also  be  the  case  for  strontium,\nalthough the other two base cations, magnesium and barium, follow the  decreasing  concentration\nwith depth trend. Higher concentrations  of  calcium  appear  at  depth  as  some  weathered  chalk\nbedrock is present below 50 cm. Low concentrations of both iron and  manganese  throughout  the\nprofile suggest the soil is  well  aerated  and  not  subject  to  gleying.  This  reflects  the  oxidising\nconditions  in  the  soil  thereby  facilitating  breakdown  of  diuron  by  an  aerobic  route  through\nsuccessive demethylation of the urea group.  The  low  concentration  of  iron  also  precludes  any\nsignificant sorption to iron hydroxides. The high calcium concentrations clearly  indicate  that  the\nsoil is calcareous and as such the conditions are  alkaline  and  well  buffered.  The  relatively  low\nconcentrations  of  elements  such  as  cadmium,  copper  and  chromium  suggests  that  microbial\nactivity should not be suppressed by potentially toxic metals.\nDissolved and Solid Phase Organic Carbon\nThe carbon content of both the soil and the soil solution is expected to have a significant effect  on\ndiuron transport since sorption is considered a key process in  attenuation  (Madsen  et  al.,  2000).\nThe relative proportions of solid phase organic  matter  and  dissolved  organic  matter  effectively\ncompete for hydrophobic organic  molecules.  Figure  5  shows  how  organic  carbon  varies  with\ndepth.  Organic carbon in the solid phase (TOC)  varies  from  4.97  to  0.94%  whereas  dissolved\norganic carbon ranges from 112 to 28 mg\/L. TOC shows a good decreasing trend with depth, with\nconcentrations declining at roughly  0.1%  organic  carbon  per  cm.  DOC  also  shows  a  general\ndecreasing trend with depth although the lowest DOC measurement occurs at 18 cm rather than  at\nthe profile bottom. DOC concentrations decline at  roughly  2  mg\/L  per  cm.  The  ratio  between\nsolid phase and dissolved phase carbon is approximately 500:1. At the  application  rate  used,  the\ndiuron added should contribute no more than 1 mg to the DOC.\nMoisture Content and Yields\nThe moisture content of the soil ranges from a maximum of  88%  at  the  top  of  the  profile  to  a\nminimum of 22% at 54 cm. Interestingly, the moisture content varies most greatly with time at the\ntop of the profile with a coefficient  of  variance  (CV)  of  22%.  At  27 cm  the  moisture  content\nremains remarkably constant with a CV of just 1% over the 50 day experiment. Water yields  vary\nmore greatly than the moisture contents with a maximum yield of 36% at the top of the profile and\na minimum of 7%  at  45 cm.  Although  the  moisture  contents  for  27 cm  remained  remarkably\nconstant, yields from this depth showed the greatest variance over time, with a CV of 36%.\nDiuron Detections\nSignificant concentrations of diuron (7 \u00b5g\/L) and DCPU (0.5 \u00b5g\/L)  are  found  in  the  porewaters\nrecovered from below 50 cm just  8  days  after  application.  After  the  same  interval,  detectable\nconcentrations of  diuron (17 \u00b5g\/kg),  DCMPU  (0.6  \u00b5g\/kg),  DCPU  (0.2  \u00b5g\/kg)  and  DCA  (2.0\n\u00b5g\/kg) were all found in the soil residue material from this depth.\nA mass balance approach has been used in Figure 6 to show the percentages  of  total  diuron  and  bromide\nrecovered  on  each  sampling  occasion  as  a  function  of  the  original  amount  applied.   The   effect   of\nheterogeneity is clearly demonstrated as bromide recovery varies between 64 and 440%  of  that  originally\napplied (mean recovery is 174%). Recovery of total diuron (the sum  of  diuron  and  its  metabolites)  as  a\npercentage of that originally applied as active agent accounts  for  between  1  and  43%  in  the  porewaters\n(mean recovery 15%). From the solid phase of the soil the range  is  21-183%  (mean  recovery  89%).  The\nmean concentration of the total amount of diuron and metabolites recovered (porewaters  and  solid  phase)\naccounted for 104% of the amount applied but ranged between 22-226%.\nTwo best fit linear regressions have also been plotted on Figure  6.  The  regressions  have  been  calculated\nbased on the omission of the data from 15 days of sampling where 95% of the bromide was recovered. The\nreasons for this data point falling off the linear trend are unclear. Although it is reasonable  to  assume  that\nthe  amount  of  porewater  bromide  and  total  diuron  extracted  should  have  a  linear   relationship,   the\nrelationship between bromide and the amount of total  diuron  residing  in  the  solid  phase  suggests  some\nform of equilibrium state between the solid and liquid phases. Total diuron  concentrations  in  the  soil  are\nroughly five times greater than in the porewaters.\nTable 3 summarises the percentage of porewater samples found to  exceed  two  threshold  values,  0.1\u00b5g\/L\nand 1 \u00b5g\/L. These have been chosen because 0.1 \u00b5g\/L is the current EU admissible maximum and 1 \u00b5g\/L is\na factor of ten greater and as such allows for dilution effects in groundwater. Diuron occurs throughout  the\nporewater profile at concentrations greater than 0.1 \u00b5g\/L for the  whole  50  days  of  the  field   monitoring\nprogramme and at concentrations greater than 1 \u00b5g\/L for 97 % of  the  measurements  made.  DCPMU,  the\nfirst recognised metabolite of diuron was found in porewaters at  concentrations  greater  than  0.1 \u00b5g\/L  for\n69% of measurements made  with  the  number  of  detections  at  this  concentration  generally  showing  a\ndecreasing  trend  with  depth.  DCPU,  the  second  sequential  metabolite  of  diuron  was  detected   on   a\nsurprising 92% of occasions at a concentration greater than  0.1\u00b5g\/L.  At  the  higher  threshold  value  of  1\n\u00b5g\/L, DCPMU and DCPU are detected roughly the same  number  of  times  with  the  number  of  positive\ndetections decreasing with depth. DCA was detected at concentrations greater than 0.1 \u00b5g\/L  on  roughly  a\nthird of occasions with the majority of these occurring in the lower 20 cm of the profile.\nTable 4 summarises the percentage of  soil  samples  found  to  exceed  threshold  values  of  0.5 \u00b5g\/kg  and\n5 \u00b5g\/kg. These have been chosen based on the maximum admissible concentration and an assumed average\nwater content of 200 g\/kg. Diuron occurs throughout the profile at concentrations greater than 0.5 \u00b5g\/kg on\nall extractions carried out and at concentrations greater than 5 \u00b5g\/kg  on  89%  of  measurements  made.  At\nthis higher threshold the number of positive detections declines  with  depth.  DCPMU  is  detected  on  the\nmajority  of  occasions  (95%)  at  concentrations  greater  than  0.5 \u00b5g\/kg  and  on  half  of  the  samples  at\nconcentrations greater than 5 \u00b5g\/kg, where they all occur in the top 27 cm. DCPU is detected 58% and 18%\nof the time at concentrations exceeding 0.5 \u00b5g\/kg and  5 \u00b5g\/kg  respectively.  Detections  generally  decline\nwith depth. The greater positive detection of DCPMU over DCPU in the soil is in contrast to what is  found\nin the porewaters where DCPU tends to prevail at concentrations between 0.1 and 1 \u00b5g\/L.  DCA  occurs  in\nthe top 27 cm on a several occasions at concentrations greater than 5 \u00b5g\/kg  at  concentrations  greater  than\n0.5 \u00b5g\/kg is commonly found throughout the profile.\nMeasurements made on groundwater found concentrations of diuron and DCPMU greater than 0.1 \u00b5g\/L  on\njust one occasion 8 days  after  application.  No  other  metabolites  were  found  and  neither  was  bromide\ndetected at the water table.\nTemporal Changes in Diuron and Metabolites\nAn assessment of how the relative proportions of diuron and its metabolites vary with time  in  the\nporewaters is shown in Figure 7. A gradual decline in parent concentration can be observed so that\nafter 50 days diuron accounts for 90% of the total diuron and metabolites found in the  porewaters\nof the entire profile. This  decline  is  not  however  completely  smooth,  with  an  apparent  slight\nincrease in  relative  diuron  porewater  concentrations  after  29  and  36  days.  The  second  most\ndominant compound detected is DCPMU which initially accounts for 0.25%  of  total  diuron  and\nmetabolites after 1 day and 9% after 50 days. DCPU accounts for just over 1% of total diuron  and\nmetabolites detected after 50 days with the relative proportion growing from 0.1% on day 1. DCA\nfirst contributes 0.1% of the total after 22 days  and  this  contribution  is  then  relatively  constant\nthroughout the remainder of the monitoring period.\nA similar assessment has been carried out for the centrifuged soil  and  is  shown  in  Figure  8.  The  parent\ncompound is again dominant, accounting for initially 96% of the total  amount  of  diuron  and  metabolites\npresent. After 50 days this has declined to just over 80%. A  slight  increase  in  the  relative  proportion  of\ndiuron again occurs after 29 and 36 days. DCPMU is again the dominant  metabolite,  accounting  for  17%\nof total diuron and metabolites sorbed to the  solid  phase  after  50  days.  From  15  days  DCPU  starts  to\naccount for between 1 and  1.5%  of   total  diuron  and  metabolites  detected.  DCA  starts  to  account  for\nroughly 1% of the total found after 22 days and remains at a fairly constant concentration.\nDetermining Bromide and Diuron Transport\nMovement of bromide and diuron has been determined to assess the rate at which they  migrate  to\ngroundwater and whether or not any preferential movement or  attenuation  occurs.  Concentration\nagainst time curves have been determined for all the analytes in both the porewaters and in the soil\nto show when the bulk of the fluid movement is occurring. These curves have been normalised for\n each analyte in a given depth range. An  example  for  the  movement  of  bromide  and  diuron  is\ngiven in Figure 9.  The curves show how the  relative  concentrations  of  a  given  analyte  change\nwith time. In the 18-27 cm sampling interval bromide reaches a peak concentration after  29  days.\nFor the peak in bromide  to  reach  the  36-45 cm  interval  takes  a  further  7  days,  therefore  the\nbromide is moving over this range at an average  rate  of  roughly  2.5 cm\/d.  The  data  for  diuron\nplotted on Figure 9 shows a very similar rate of transport to bromide.\nBy  finding  the  maxima  in  concentration  at  each  depth  range  it  is  possible  to  compare  the  rates  of\nmovement of bromide with diuron and its metabolites. Figure 10 displays a plot showing the time at  which\na peak in concentration occurred at a given depth for the sampled porewaters. Bromide moves  through  the\nentire profile at an average rate of 1.1 cm\/d, although in fact the plot displays  a  break  in  gradient  around\nthe 27 centimetre point with movement occurring at 0.6 cm\/d before this point and 2.25 cm\/d after it.\nDiuron does not appear to move in the same  way  as  bromide.  It  takes  twice  as  long  to  get  to  18  cm,\nhowever once at this point it has also been  able  to  migrate  further  in  little  or  no  time  indicating  some\npreferential movement. Diuron is then apparently retained relative to bromide, with a peak in concentration\nat 36 cm occurring 4 days after bromide has reached this point. However, from here on diuron moves more\nrapidly than bromide. Diuron reaches the profile bottom 5 days before bromide and has an average velocity\nof 1.25 cm\/d.\nDCPMU and DCPU are retained for longer than diuron in the top part of the profile and can  not  of  course\noccur until diuron starts to degrade. DCPMU then follows a similar pathway to  diuron  although  does  not\nappear to move more rapidly between 18 and 27 cm taking 3 days longer than  diuron  to  reach  this  point.\nDCPU is retained for longer than DCPMU and takes 36 days to reach 18 cm. However, DCPU then  moves\nrapidly with diuron and DCPMU. Both of these degradation products have reached a peak at the bottom  of\nthe profile before bromide. DCA reaches a maximum concentration in the top soil after 50 days.\nFigure 11 displays a similar plot to Figure 10 but  is  for  the  soil  residue  data.  Diuron  follows  a  similar\npattern to the porewaters although  moves  more  rapidly  between  18  and  45 cm  than  in  the  porewater.\nDiuron has distributed itself throughout the solid phase at the same rate  as  it  has  through  the  porewaters\n(1.25 cm\/d). DCPMU is again retained in the top soil and then continues to move throughout the  profile  in\na similar manner to diuron although is generally displaced by 3-5 days. This may  reflect  both  the  rate  of\ndegradation of diuron and attenuation of DCPMU. DCPU and DCA both behave in a manner  considerably\ndifferent to the porewaters. Initially DCPU is retained for 15 days in the top soil but then takes a further  35\ndays to move down to 18 cm.\nDiscussion\nMovement and partial degradation  of  diuron,  applied  at  normal  concentrations  under  realistic\nenvironmental conditions, has occurred rapidly. It is generally assumed  that  the  majority  of  the\nparent and daughter compounds will remain in  the  top  soil  (Tworkoski  et  al.,  2000),  however\ndiuron and its metabolites have been found at depths in  excess  of  50 cm  in  8  days  in  both  the\nporewaters and  associated  with  the  soil  solid  phase.  As  the  concentration  of  organic  carbon\ndecreases with depth,  adsorption  is  also  diminished  in  effectiveness.  As  the  concentration  of\norganic carbon declines so too  does  the  microbial  activity,  further  reducing  the  magnitude  of\nbiodegradation. Once the diuron has escaped from the soil zone there is little to prevent it reaching\nthe unsaturated zone of an aquifer and ultimately the water table.\nSeveral previous studies have observed preferential flow mechanisms operating in soils (Harris et al., 1994;\nJohnson et al., 1996) and this is appears to be occurring at this site. Rainfall data  (Figure  4)  shows  heavy\nprecipitation in the days just before the major pulse  of  diuron  and  its  metabolites  migrate  more  rapidly\nthrough the soil after 36 days. Consequently there  is  little  time  for  sorption  to  take  place  (Walker  and\nJurado-Exposito,  1998)  and  the  relatively  high  concentration  of  organic  carbon  has   little   effect   on\nattenuation. Although data from the moisture contents and yields shows considerable variation in the top  9\ncm, there is no other evidence for a large pulse of water moving through the profile, therefore  it  is  further\nsupport for water movement by a preferential pathway. It has been shown  that  the  formulation  of  diuron\ncan influence its mobility (Chaplain et al., 2001) and it is proposed therefore that the  suspension  produced\nfor the environmental application of diuron attaches itself to particles and  moves  as  colloids  through  the\nsoil profile (Grolimund et al., 1996) and is transported more rapidly  than  the  average  downward  flux  of\nrecharge. This has previously been proposed as a mechanism for  pesticide  movement  in  a  chalk  aquifer\n(Gooddy et al., 2001).\nThe dynamics and kinetics of diuron sorption and desorption are clearly complex  (Alva  and  Singh,  1991;\nReddy et al., 1992; Gaillardon,  1997)  and  hard  to  establish  from  a  field  experiment  especially  in  the\ncompeting presence of metabolites. The high speed centrifugation  process  is  assumed  to  remove  all  the\nmobile water, however water carrying diuron has clearly been able to  travel  throughout  the  depth  of  the\nsoil and sorb to the soil surface. The  greater  amount  of  DCPMU  found  in  the  soil  compared  with  the\nporewater solutions (where higher relative amounts of DCPU are found) may reflect  structural  differences\nbetween the two compounds, with DCPMU more readily sorbed to organic matter  than  DCPU  due  to  its\nadditional methyl group. The form of  the  carbon  and  hence  competition  for  sorption  sites  in  both  the\ndissolved phase and in the solid phase will also influence  the  partitioning  of  these  degradation  products.\nUnfortunately, no data have been found for Koc values or solubilities for DCPMU or DCPU.  Alternatively\nthis reversal may be indicative of their relative rates of production and\/or removal.\nIt is not possible to quantify how much transport of the metabolites occurs as a  result  of  formation  at  the\nsurface or formation in situ as diuron moves through the profile. The profile for DCA in porewaters (Figure\n10) does not display a continuous flow path through the profile which suggests that in  situ  degradation  of\nDCPU is occurring. Consequently although a peak in DCA is found at the profile bottom after 29 days  this\ncould be due to some degradation resulting from the leading tail of DCPU. In the soil  profile,  both  DCPU\nand DCA show peak concentrations arriving at depth well before the parent  compound  or  DCPMU.  This\ncertainly suggests  some  in  situ  degradation  but  could  also  represent  colloidal  transport  of  these  two\nmetabolites. It is important to note that the concentrations of the maxima are  both  relatively  low,  roughly\n0.5 \u00b5g\/kg for DCPU and 1 \u00b5g\/kg for DCA compared with a concentration in the top soil  of  100 \u00b5g\/kg  and\n60 \u00b5g\/kg for DCPU and DCA respectively. Any such  colloidal  movement  would  be  likely  to  be  highly\ndependant on the charge of the particles (Grolimund et al, 1996) which in turn is influenced  by  the  pH  of\nthe soil system. Additionally it is possible that the peak in porewater DCA  at  the  profile  bottom  may  be\ncaused by gradual desorption of DCA from the soil matrix.\nConclusion\nThrough carrying out a field experiment rather than laboratory column studies it has been possible\nto observe what happens to diuron and  its  metabolites  under  physical  and  chemical  conditions\ntypical of a soil overlying the Chalk. The use of a bromide tracer has assisted in understanding the\nrate of fluid movement through the soil and is invaluable for comparison with the diuron data. The\ndevelopment of a  low  volume,  high  sensitivity  analytical  method  has  enabled  relatively  cost\neffective, high resolution measurement of environmental processes. Despite the resolution used,  it\nis  still  not  possible  to  quantify  the  processes  in  detail  due  to   the   considerable   degree   of\nheterogeneity encountered. The complexity of the system has made it impossible to determine  the\nrate at which degradation occurs under typical conditions. There is good evidence to  suggest  that\nmetabolites formed in the top few  centimetres  of  soil  are  able  to  migrate  through  the  profile,\nsorbing and desorbing from the soil matrix. Field evidence also suggests the  continued  formation\nof degradation products as the parent compound continues to leach  through  the  soil.  Preferential\nflow has been observed at the field site and this is thought to be caused  by  intensive  rainfall  and\nby the sorption of the parent and metabolites to colloidal material.  Migration  in  this  way  means\nthat groundwater is particularly vulnerable  to  contamination,  since  it  can  be  penetrated  before\ncomplete degradation has had time to take place.\nThe study has demonstrated the importance of determining both  the  parent  compound  and  its  respective\nmajor  metabolites.  After  50  days,  10%  of  total  pesticide  compounds  in  the  porewater   consisted   of\ndegradation products. After the same time period, nearly 20% of  total  pesticide  found  in  the  soil  matrix\nconsisted of degradation products. Roughly five times more diuron and metabolites were  found  sorbed  to\nthe soil matrix than in the porewater solution. This suggests the desorption processes from the  soil  surface\nwill provide a source of these compounds for some time to come. Land where diuron has been applied may\ntherefore remain a threat to groundwater quality especially if it is used indiscriminately on non-agricultural\nareas.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work continues with Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) funding  to  the  British\nGeological Survey.
