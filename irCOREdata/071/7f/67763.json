Such oscillations are responsible for stall flutter\nin e.g. turbine blades and bridges, or \u00c6olian tones when in the acoustic range. The\nprocess of vortex separation from the oscillating surface is modelled as a self-excited\noscillator. The vortex separation frequency remains synchronized with the oscillations\nof the cylinder over a great range of frequency mismatches, enabling the amplitudes\nand frequencies to be calculated. Only when the vortex separation frequency is much\nless than the cylinder\u2019s natural oscillation frequency does the synchronization break\ndown, and two-frequency oscillations (beats) then occur.\n1. Introduction\nIt has long been known that, when fluid flows past lengthy bodies, they can radiate\n\u00c6olian tones [1], sounds resulting from the reaction to the vortex-shedding that creates\na Ka\u00b4rma\u00b4n wake [2] downstream of the body, as sketched in Fig. 1. Familiar examples\ninclude the \u201csinging\u201d of telegraph wires in the wind, the side movement of an oar in\nwater, and the \u00c6olian harp. The phenomenon also arises in the engineering context as\nthe stall flutter [3, 4] of e.g. helicopter rotors, turbine blades, suspension bridges, steel\nfactory pipes, and periscopes of submarines [5, 6, 7, 8, 3, 9]. We will refer to all such\nself-oscillations as stall flutter, and will not try to distinguish [8, 10] between the cases\nof immovable or flexible cylinders because in both cases there occurs the excitation of\nself-oscillations. Stall flutter often manifests when one of the body\u2019s natural oscillation\nfrequencies is close to the frequency at which vortex separation would occur from the\nsame body while immovable. The rotary oscillations of wires caused by stall flutter are\nsimilar in form to thermo-mechanical self-oscillations [11]. Stall flutter is known to have\nbeen the underlying cause of many technical disasters of which one of the best known\nis probably the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows suspension bridge [6, 3]. Despite its\nprevalence and widespread importance, many experimental results and much numerical\nanalysis [12, 13], there is not yet to our knowledge a strict quantitative theory of stall\nflutter.\nPublished in J. Phys. A Math. Gen. 43, 375101 (2010).\n\u00c6olian tones and stall flutter of lengthy objects 2\nFigure 1. Schematic diagram of the Ka\u00b4rma\u00b4n wake for streamlined flow around a\ncylinder\nStall flutter is often interpreted as the excitation of resonant oscillations under the\naction of a periodic force caused by the vortex separation with a frequency dependent\non the flow velocity, and the size and shape of the streamlined body. The force\nfrequency may be found from the condition that the Strouhal number St = fD\/U0\nremains approximately constant, where, f is the frequency of vortex separation, D is\nthe cylinder diameter, and U0 is the flow velocity. We comment that such explanations\nare in immediate conflict with the observation that stall flutter of sufficiently long ropes\ncan be maintained by flow at very different velocities over different sections of the rope.\nIn reality, as we shall see below, stall flutter does not correspond simply to forced\noscillations. Rather, it is a unified self-oscillatory phenomenon.\nBecause the process of vortex separation is evidently of a self-oscillatory character\n[11, 12, 14, 15, 16], and the streamlined body represents an oscillatory element with\none or several natural frequencies, the stall flutter phenomenon must be similar to\nself-oscillations in a system containing both active and passive oscillatory elements.\nIn this paper we therefore model stall flutter as an interaction phenomenon arising\nbetween a self-excited oscillator (the flow oscillator) [14, 15, 16] corresponding to the\nperiodic vortex separation, and a passive oscillator (the elastic cylinder around which\nthe fluid flows). Note that the problems of this type were first investigated and solved\nby physicists of the Mandelstam school in Moscow (including A. Andronov, A. Witt,\nS. Strelkov and A. Skibarko), in 1934. The corresponding physical effects are known in\ntextbooks on oscillation theory as pulling phenomena.\n2. Stall flutter as a self-oscillatory phenomenon\nStall flutter is remarkably similar to self-oscillations in a system containing both active\nand passive oscillatory elements [11]. A classic example of such a system is an oscillator\nwith an additional oscillatory circuit [17, 18, 19, 20]. So we may anticipate that all of the\nwell-established features of such systems (e.g. frequency-pulling and the characteristic\nvariation of the oscillation amplitudes as the frequency mismatch varies) will appear in\n\u00c6olian tones and stall flutter of lengthy objects 3\nFigure 2. The dependence of the mismatch between the frequency of vortex separation\nfrom the oscillated (f and immovable f0 cylinders \u2206St = (f\u2212f0)D\/U0 on the mismatch\nbetween the frequency fc of the cylinder oscillations and f0 \u2206St0 = (fc \u2212 f0)D\/U0\nexpressed in terms of the Strouhal numbers. From experimental data in [25]\nthe case of stall flutter too. Before attempting to model stall flutter in this way, we\nmake a few general remarks about philosophy of modelling.\n2.1. Levels of modelling\nModeling stall flutter in the way suggested above does not, of course, signify that such\na complex phenomenon is described by equations identical to those of an oscillator\nwith an additional oscillatory circuit. It is clearly evident that these equations are not\nisomorphic with those for stall flutter. Due to the well-known universality of the laws of\noscillation theory, however, we can describe a wide range of oscillation phenomena with\nrelatively simple models described by known equations [21]. For example, turbulent\nprocesses in submerged jets can be modeled successfully [22, 23] by the equation of a\npendulum with a randomly vibrated suspension axis, and the dynamics of the human\ncardiovascular system can be modeled successfully [24] with Poincare\u00b4 oscillators. In the\npresent case, we use a generic oscillator to model the observed behaviour of the system,\nrather than approaching it via the mechanics of continuous media (hydrodynamics).\nThere are numerous other examples in science of high level modeling of a similar kind,\nwhere one models an observed phenomenon rather than trying to predict it from a\nfirst-principles approach based on the properties of more fundamental elements (e.g.\nmolecules or continua or cells) of the system.\nNote that, in contradistinction to some of the earlier work on the oscillator with\nan additional oscillatory circuit [17, 18, 19, 20], where only one-frequency regime was\nconsidered, we show below that in our system a two-frequency regime exists for a small\nrange of mismatches between the vortex separation and cylinder oscillation frequencies.\n\u00c6olian tones and stall flutter of lengthy objects 4\nFigure 3. Schematic image of the oscillations of an elastic cylinder of length l taking\nplace along axis z in the case of flowing in the direction of axis x\n2.2. Vortex separation as self-oscillations. Synchronization of the vortex separation\nprocess\nTo justify the self-oscillatory character of the vortex separation process, we note first\nthat the velocity and pressure pulsations at any point behind a streamlined body\nhave a rather narrow spectrum with a well-defined maximum. Detemple-Laake and\nEckelmann have already shown [14] experimentally that the vortex separation process\nfrom a streamlined body behaves like a nonlinear oscillator whose frequency can be\npulled by up to 25% by acoustic forcing. Secondly, this process from a streamlined body\nmay be synchronized by oscillations of the body at a frequency that is approximately\ndivisible by the frequency of vortex separation from the same body when immovable\n[1, 26, 27, 28, 25]. Thirdly, the dependence of the vortex separation from the oscillating\nbody on the mismatch between the body oscillation frequency fb and the frequency\nof vortex separation from the immovable body is very similar to the well-known\ndependence of the frequency of synchronized oscillations of a van der Pol oscillator\non the mismatch between the free self-oscillation frequency and the external forcing\nfrequency [21]: see e.g. Fig. 2 constructed from the experimental data of [25]. In\nthis figure \u2206St = (f \u2212 f0)D\/U0 and \u2206St0 = (fc \u2212 f0)D\/U0 are the mismatches\nbetween the frequencies of vortex separation from the oscillating f and the immovable f0\ncylinders expressed in terms of the Strouhal numbers, fc is the frequency of the cylinder\noscillations, D is the cylinder diameter, and U0 is the flow velocity. For comparison\nthe dependence \u2206St =\n\u221a\n(\u2206St0)2 \u2212 (\u2206St0)2s , where (\u2206St0)s is the half-width of the\nsynchronization region, is shown in the same figure by a dashed line.\nThis dependence should be valid in the case of synchronization of the oscillator by\na small harmonic external force. However, judging by the fact that the synchronization\nregion is rather wide, the amplitude of the cylinder oscillations was significant, resulting\nin a steeper dependence of \u2206St on \u2206St0. As in other oscillators synchronization\ncan occur, not only for the fundamental frequency, but also for its harmonics and\nsubharmonics [27].\n\u00c6olian tones and stall flutter of lengthy objects 5\n3. A mathematical model of stall flutter\nWe therefore consider the oscillations of an elastic circular cylinder of length l with\nfixed ends, placed transversely to the flow as shown in Fig. 3. The streamlines around\na circular cylinder have been considered in many books [29, 9] and papers [27, 30]. A\nKa\u00b4rma\u00b4n vortex wake [31] is formed behind a streamlined cylinder. For the Reynolds\nnumbers 40 < Re < 150 it is regular, and for 150 < Re < 300 it is turbulent. For\n300 < Re < 2 \u00b7 105 the Ka\u00b4rma\u00b4n wake becomes again close to regular, but with turbulent\nbursts. After this, for Re > 5 \u00b7 106, a dominant vortex separation frequency is again\nobserved in the wake spectrum [32]. It should be emphasized that such an alternation\nbetween regions of different behavior as a parameter changes is typical of chaotic self-\noscillatory systems [33, 11]. In particular, the region 300 < Re < 2 \u00b7 105 may be\nconsidered as a region of intermittency. The scenario represents additional evidence\nthat the formation of the Ka\u00b4rma\u00b4n wake is a self-oscillation process. In what follows we\nwill consider only that range of Reynolds numbers where vortex separation occurs in an\nalmost periodic manner.\nA stalling streamline in the direction of the x axis with velocity V (identical for\nall cylinder sections [34]) results in a nearly periodic lift force Fkz(t) along the z axis,\nand a drag force Frx(t) along the x axis toward the flow. The latter is made up of: a\nslowly-changing component; and a component that is nearly periodic at half the period\nof the lift force.\nFor an immovable cylinder, over a wide range of the Reynolds numbers, the\nfrequency of the lift force is equal to that of vortex separation \u03c9v, and the frequency of\nthe drag force is equal to 2\u03c9v [27]. The difference arises because the lift force frequency\nis defined by the distance between vortices along one side of the Ka\u00b4rma\u00b4n wake (2\u03bb),\nwhereas the drag force frequency is defined by the distance between vortices along both\nsides of the Ka\u00b4rma\u00b4n wake (\u03bb) (see Fig. 1).\nThe frequency \u03c9v is connected to the Strouhal number St and the flow velocity V\nby \u03c9v = 2piSt\/DV, where D is the cylinder diameter. Experiments [9] show that, for\n40 < Re < 150, the Strouhal number increases with Re, then becomes approximately\nconstant and equal to 0.2, and then increases again as shown in Fig. 4 [9]. For\n2 \u00b7 105 < Re < 5 \u00b7 106 the vortex wake is strongly turbulent, so that the Strouhal\nnumber cannot be determined. For Re > 5 \u00b7 106, the Strouhal number St \u2248 0.3.\nAs far as we are aware, no equations have been proposed that would enable us to\ndescribe rigorously the lift and drag forces for a stalling streamline. However, expressions\nfor their amplitudes and frequencies have been deduced via dimensional considerations\n[29, 27, 30, 3, 9]. The amplitudes of the lift and drag forces Fkz(t) and Frx(t) are\ncorrespondingly\nAkz = ck(Re)Syz\n\u03c1V 2\n2\n, Arx = cr(Re)Syz\n\u03c1V 2\n2\n, (1)\nwhere ck(Re) and cr(Re) are factors depending on the quality of streamlining (the worse\nthe streamlining, the larger the values of ck and cr) and on the Reynolds number, Syz is\n\u00c6olian tones and stall flutter of lengthy objects 6\nthe area of the body projection on the plane yz normal to the flow direction. We note\nthat the factor cr(Re) is always much less than ck(Re), i.e. the oscillating component of\nthe drag force is small in comparison to the lift force.\nFor an oscillating cylinder, forces arising from the non-stationarity of the streamline\nmust be added to the forces Fkz(t) and Frx(t) defining the added hydrodynamic mass\nand an additional damping factor; and the factors ck(Re) and cr(Re) will depend on the\noscillation amplitude.\nConsidering the oscillating cylinder as a stretched string, we write the equations of\nits oscillations along axes x and z as\n\u03c1s\n\u22022ux\n\u2202t2\n+ \u03b2\n\u2202ux\n\u2202t\n\u2212 T \u2202\n2ux\n\u2202y2\n=\nFrx(t)\nArx\n,\n\u03c1s\n\u22022uz\n\u2202t2\n+ \u03b2\n\u2202uz\n\u2202t\n\u2212 T \u2202\n2uz\n\u2202y2\n=\nFkz(t)\nAkz\n, (2)\nwhere ux(y, t)\/Arx and uz(y, t)\/Akz are the relative cylinder displacements along x and z,\n\u03c1s is the linear density of the string, T is the string tension, and \u03b2 is the damping factor.\nIf the cylinder ends are fixed, the boundary conditions are ux(0, t) = 0, ux(l, t) =\n0, uz(0, t) = 0, uz(l, t) = 0.\nNoting that Frx(t) and Fkz(t) are nonzero only for 0 \u2264 y \u2264 l, and recalling that\nthe drag force frequency is twice the lift force frequency, we write\nFrx(t) = Arx\n\u221e\u2211\nj=1\nf (j)rx (t) sin\n(\n2(2j \u2212 1)pi\nl\ny\n)\n,\nFkz(t) = Akz\n\u221e\u2211\nj=1\nf\n(j)\nkz (t) sin\n(\n(2j \u2212 1)pi\nl\ny\n)\n, (3)\nwhere\nf (j)rx (t) =\nFrx(t)\n2(2j \u2212 1)piArx , f\n(j)\nkz (t) =\nFkz(t)\n(2j \u2212 1)piAkz .\nIf the frequency of vortex separation from the oscillating cylinder is close to its n-th\nFigure 4.

(4)\nSolving Eqs. (2) by expansion in terms of the natural functions for an undamped string\nwith fixed ends, and retaining only the first term in the expansion, we have\nux(y, t) = U\n(j)\nx (t) sin\n(\n2(2j \u2212 1)pi\nl\ny\n)\n,\nuz(y, t) = U\n(j)\nz (t) sin\n(\n(2j \u2212 1)pi\nl\ny\n)\n.\nIn so doing we find for functions U (n)z (t) and U\n(2n)\nx (t) the following equations:\nd2Uz\ndt2\n+ 2\u03b4\ndUz\ndt\n+ \u03c92nUz =\nf\n(n)\nkz (t)\n\u03c1s\n,\nd2Ux\ndt2\n+ 2\u03b4\ndUx\ndt\n+ 4\u03c92nUx =\nf (2n)rx (t)\n\u03c1s\n, (5)\nwhere \u03b4 = \u03b2\/(2\u03c1s)\u00bf \u03c9n.\nOwing to the difference of the oscillation frequencies in the x and z directions, the\nresultant oscillations will in general be of complex form. Moreover, in the ranges of\nReynolds numbers where the vortex separation process is random, these oscillations will\nalso be random. Precisely this feature was observed prior to collapse of the Tacoma\nbridge, and it also appears in the stall flutter of power lines.\nAs indicated above, the vortex separation process is self-oscillatory in nature. It\narises owing to the formation behind the streamlined body of a backwash, providing\nthe feedback needed for excitation of the self-oscillations. To calculate the forces\nFkz(y, t) and Frx(y, t) we take the van der Pol oscillator as a model of the excitation\nof self-oscillations phenomenon [11]. Taking account of the experimental fact that the\ncylinder oscillations can synchronize the vortex separation, we write the following model\nequations for frx(t) and fkz(t):\nd2fkz\ndt2\n\u2212 \u00b5\n(\n1\u2212 4f 2kz\n)dfkz\ndt\n+ \u03c92vfkz = m1Uz,\nd2frx\ndt2\n\u2212 \u00b5\n(\n1\u2212 4f 2rx\n)dfrx\ndt\n+ 4\u03c92vfrx = m2Ux, (6)\nwhere \u00b5 is a small parameter, and the coupling coefficients m1,2 are assumed small.\nThe terms m1Uz and m2Ux are responsible for the synchronization of vortex separation\nby the cylinder oscillations. Note that \u00b5 represents a negative friction that is inversely\nproportional to the transition time of the self-oscillations. Depending on the value of\n\u00b5, therefore, the oscillations can in principle occur at almost any frequency and are not\nconfined to the acoustic range.\n\u00c6olian tones and stall flutter of lengthy objects 8\nFigure 5.

(6) that, for Ux(t) \u2261 Uz(t) \u2261 0, the stationary values of Fkz(t)\nand Frx(t) are\nFkz(t) = Akzfkz(t) \u2248 Akz cos(\u03c9vt),\nFrx(t) = Arxfrx(t) \u2248 Arx cos(2\u03c9vt+ \u03d5), (7)\nwhere \u03d5 represents the phase shift between the drag and lift forces. Note that (7) are\nin full accord with the expressions for the lift and drag forces given in [27].\nEqs. (5) and (6) describe two independent self-oscillatory systems each of which has\ntwo degrees of freedom. In terms of oscillation theory, each of them is an oscillator with\nan additional oscillatory circuit coupled to the main one by a capacitance [19]. Due to\noscillations of the instantaneous streamline velocity as the cylinder oscillates, Eqs. (6)\ncould be nonlinearly coupled, but we neglect this possibility. A similar oscillator, but\nwith inductive coupling, was studied by Andronov and Witt with use of the Poincare\u00b4\nsmall parameter method [17], and by Strelkov using qualitative methods [18]. These\nworks considered a single-frequency approximation, i.e. the synchronous regime. In\neach case, parameter ranges were identified where frequency-pulling and quenching of\nthe self-oscillations occurred. It should be noted that the character of coupling may be\ndefined only by using experimental data. We have set capacitive coupling because it\nresults in new phenomenon (the beat regime) in comparison with inductive one.\nWe now consider the system described by the first equations in (5) and (6). For an\napproximate solution we apply the averaging method of Bogolyubov [35] as developed\nby Mitropol\u2019sky [36], but in the form described in [20].

It should be noted that Eqs. (10) are exact equations for the\namplitudes and phases.\nProceeding to apply the averaging method, in the first approximation it is necessary\nto solve Eqs.

(10), (11) may be set equal to\nzero, yielding the following equations for the amplitudes A1, A2, phase difference \u03d5 and\nrelative self-oscillation frequency \u03c9\u02dc:\n\u00b5\u02dc(1\u2212 A21)\u2212\nm\u02dc1\n\u03c9\u02dc\nA2\nA1\nsin\u03d5 = 0, 2\u03b4\u02dc\nA2\nA1\n\u2212 m\u02dc2\n\u03c9\u02dc\nsin\u03d5 = 0,\n1\u2212 \u03be\n2\n\u03c9\u02dc2\n+\nm\u02dc1\n\u03c9\u02dc2\nA2\nA1\ncos\u03d5 = 0,\n(\n1\u2212 1\n\u03c9\u02dc2\n)\nA2\nA1\n+\nm\u02dc2\n\u03c9\u02dc2\ncos\u03d5 = 0. (12)\nEliminating the amplitude ratio A2\/A1 from Eqs. (12, (12), we find the following\nequations for the phase difference \u03d5 and the relative frequency \u03c9\u02dc:\n\u03c9\u02dc(\u03c9\u02dc2 \u2212 \u03be2) + m\u02dc1m\u02dc2\n4\u03b4\u02dc\nsin 2\u03d5 = 0, (\u03c9\u02dc2 \u2212 1) tan \u03d5+ 2\u03b4\u02dc\u03c9\u02dc = 0. (13)\nNext, we calculate the dependence of the self-oscillation amplitudes on the frequency\nmismatch. From (12), (12),\nA1 =\n\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a1\u2212 m\u02dc1m\u02dc2\n2\u00b5\u02dc\u03b4\u02dc\u03c9\u02dc2\nsin2 \u03d5, A2 =\nm\u02dc2\n2\u03b4\u02dc\u03c9\u02dc\nA1 sin\u03d5. (14)\nSubstituting \u03c9\u02dc(\u03be) and \u03d5(\u03be) calculated above, we find the dependences of A1 and A2 on\n\u03be. Some examples are shown in Fig. 5.\n4. Discussion and conclusions\nThe dependences of the lift force and cylinder oscillation amplitudes (A1 and A2) are\nquite different from each other, although each has a minimum at \u03be = 1. On either\nside of the minimum, the oscillation amplitude of the lift force increases monotonically,\nwhereas that of the cylinder exhibits maxima.\nExamples of the dependences of \u03c9\/\u03c9n and \u03d5 on the mismatch \u03be are shown in Fig. 6.\nIt is seen from Fig. 6(a) that, for mismatches \u03be \u2264 \u03becr, i.e. for comparatively small\nfrequencies of vortex separation in the case of an immovable cylinder, synchronous self-\noscillations are impossible. The value of \u03becr can be found analytically. It is equal to\n\u03becr =\n\u221a\nm1m2\/\u03c94n.\n\u00c6olian tones and stall flutter of lengthy objects 11\nAs the mismatch increases, the self-oscillation frequency tends to the frequency of\nthe oscillator without its additional circuit, but not monotonically. In the vicinity of\n\u03be = 1, frequency-pulling occurs when the self-oscillation frequency depends, not only\non the initial value of the frequency, but also on the direction of its variation. In this\nregion, our results coincide with those reported earlier [19]. The dependences in Figs. 5\nand 6 are calculated without consideration for the stability of the solutions, but these\nare readily found from Eqs. (5), (6). Unsurprisingly, some parts of the dependences near\n\u03be = 1 in these figures turn out to be unphysical and drop out.\nThe reason that the results shown in Figs. 5 and 6 differ from the corresponding\ndependences found in [16] is probably associated with the different methods used in\nthe respective calculations. Facchinetti et al [16] simply equated the coefficients of the\nmain harmonics whereas, here, we have applied well-established methods of oscillation\ntheory. Our results are consistent with those of Teodorchik [19] obtained by his energetic\nmethod.\nIn summary, we have proposed a theory of stall flutter, modeled as a self-excited\noscillator with an additive oscillatory circuit. We have shown that this process is\naccompanied by synchronization and pulling. It has enabled us to calculate the\namplitudes and frequencies of the resultant self-oscillations. We have found that vortex\nseparation may be synchronized by the natural oscillations of the cylinder, and that\nthere should also exist a regime of beating for sufficiently large frequency mismatch.\nSuch effects would be consistent with the frequency-pulling observed earlier [14] under\nacoustic forcing, and they invite experimental investigation.\nWe emphasize that our present theory allows us to find only the regular regimes of\nstall flutter. But we infer that the model described by Eqs. (4), (5), plus some additive\nnonlinear terms, will describe the chaotic regimes as well. As indicated above, such\nregimes are potentially damaging for engineering constructions.\nAcknowledgements\nThe work was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council\nand by the Royal Society (London) whom PSL gratefully acknowledges for the award\nof a visiting research fellowship.\nReferences\n[1] Richardson E G 1923 Proc.
