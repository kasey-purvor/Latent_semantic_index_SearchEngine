From University-level Bioscience, through A \nlevel and GCSEs, and as early as Key Stage 3 Science (in the revised Programme of \nStudy, commencing September 2008) the ethical and moral implications of scientific and \ntechnological discoveries are being identified as core knowledge. Here we reflect on what \nis meant by bioethics, outline some of the ethical content being introduced within the UK \nand further afield, and examine some of the controversies surrounding these \ndevelopments.  \n \nOrigins of Bioethics \nBy popular consensus, the word \u201cbioethics\u201d was first used by American cell biologist \nVan Rensselaer Potter in the early 1970s. Despite the fact that the term has frequently \nbeen employed as though it were synonymous with \u201cmedical ethics\u201d, Potter original \nperceived bioethics more broadly as being \u201ca new discipline which combines biological \nknowledge with a knowledge of human value systems\u201d (Potter, 1971).  \n \nEthical reflection on life and medicine was not, of course, newly invented at that time; \nmany traditions have long histories of thoughtful contemplation concerning, for example, \nabortion and euthanasia or mankind\u201fs interaction with the natural world. However, a \nnumber of sociological and scientific changes in the years following the Second World \nWar laid the ground for the emergence of bioethics as a discipline in its own right. These \nare documented more fully elsewhere (e.g. Bryant et al, 2005; Mepham, 2008) but \ninclude: the Nuremberg war crimes trials; increased questioning of the moral authority of \nboth traditional religions and the medical establishment; concern for the environment, as \nexemplified by Rachel Carson\u201fs 1962 book Silent Spring; and developments in molecular \nbiology which were just taking shape at that time, but have subsequently reached a point \nat which humans can, in a very real sense, exert control over the genetic basis of life. In \nline with Potter\u201fs broader definition, bioethics today can be seen to have three \noverlapping components: environmental ethics, biomedical ethics and research ethics.  \n \nHigher Education \nAlthough universities have far greater autonomy than schools to design and examine their \nown programmes, the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) is charged with establishing and \nmaintaining academic standards in higher education qualifications across the UK. As part \nof this role, the QAA makes recommendations concerning appropriate content via a set of \nsubject-specific Benchmarking Statements. The initial statement for Bioscience was \npublished in 2002, and it received light revisions in 2007 (QAA, 2002; QAA; 2007). \nBoth iterations of the statement contain the same set of expectations regarding the \nopportunities for undergraduate Bioscientists, whatever their particular field of study, to \n\u201cbe confronted by some of the scientific, moral and ethical questions raised by their study \ndiscipline, to consider viewpoints other than their own, and to engage in critical \nassessment and intellectual argument\u201d (Section 3.1). Bioscience students should be able \nto: \u201crecognise the moral and ethical issues of investigations and appreciate the need for \nethical standards and professional codes of conduct\u201d (Section 3.5) and \u201cundertake field \nand\/or laboratory investigations of living systems in a responsible, safe and ethical \nmanner\u201d (Section 3.6). By the end of their degree, a typical honours graduate emerging \nfrom any bioscience programme should \u201cbe able to construct reasoned arguments to \nsupport their position on the ethical and social impact of advances in the biosciences\u201d \n(Section 5.8). \n \nA Level \nFrom September 2008, a new series of A level Biology courses will be available. These \nwill be taken by the first cohort to have passed through the revised GCSE specifications \nintroduced in 2006 (see below). All boards have included substantial elements of \nbioethics in their curricula (summarised in Table 1 and, in an interactive form, at \nwww.le.ac.uk\/ge\/bioethics). This newer emphasis is reflective of changes already seen in \nthe Salter-Nuffield A level Biology course (SNAB) which was extensively piloted from \nSeptember 2002 and has been available as an option since September 2005. \n \nGCSE \nThe major revisions introduced in September 2006 for 14 to 16 year olds in England and \nWales have been discussed more fully in previous articles (see, for example, Burden and \nHall, 2006; Zolle, 2006). The main features, however, have been a reduction in the \nbreadth of prescribed factual content and an increased emphasis on the nature of \nscientific endeavour and the place of science within broader society. The Programme of \nStudy for this expanded How Science Works component includes the requirement that \npupils should be taught \u201cto consider how and why decisions about science and \ntechnology are made, including those that raise ethical issues, and about the social, \neconomic and environmental effects of such decisions\u201d (QCA, 2005). Each of the exam \nboards has embraced this ethical dimension and offer copious opportunities within the \ncurriculum where these aspects can be discussed (see www.le.ac.uk\/ge\/bioethics for \nsummary tables). \n \nKey Stage 3 \nThe National Curriculum for 11 to 14 year olds is also undergoing significant change. \nFrom September 2008 major revisions are being enacted across all subjects with the \nintention of introducing greater flexibility in delivery of the material and increasing \u201ereal \nworld\u201f relevance.  Echoing developments in the earlier round of GCSE revision, the \nScience curriculum will now have a strong emphasis on How Science Works. In addition \nto specific content, six foundational concepts have been identified including \u201cExamining \nthe ethical and moral implications of using and applying science\u201d (QCA, 2007). \n\u201cScientist, individuals and society\u201d, continues the explanatory notes in the revised \ndocumentation, \u201cneed to think about the balance between the advantages and \ndisadvantages of new developments before making decisions (e.g. examining issues \nrelating to selective breeding and genetic engineering of plants and animals \u2026)\u201d. They \ncontinue by highlighting the ethical and moral tension exemplified in the use of animal in \nresearch that will benefit humankind. \n Ethics in Science Curricula elsewhere \nAlthough bioethics provision is probably more embedded in UK education than \nanywhere else in the northern hemisphere, the heritage is actually longest in New \nZealand, where social and ethical issues have been part of the core curriculum since 1993 \n(Conner, 2004). Given the prominent involvement of American philosophers in the \ndevelopment of bioethics as a discipline, it might be imagined that schools in the USA \nwould also have bioethics as a compulsory subject. This is counteracted, however, by the \nabsence of a national curriculum; content is therefore determined at the state and local \ndistrict levels and may or may not include ethical issues. \n \nA systematic review of bioethics provision in Europe has not been undertaken, but an \noverview of biotechnology education, including some discussion of bioethics, was \npublished in 2002 (EBE, 2002). Almost inevitably, the report found wide variability in \nthe provision of biotechnology education in different countries and noted that the cross-\ncurricular nature of the topic made it difficult to decide within which subject the issues \nought to be discussed. Where biotechnology was discussed in science lessons the \nemphasis was frequently on the technology alone, without consideration of the wider \nsocietal issues. \n \nDriven in part by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization \n(UNESCO), the global trend has been towards increased promotion of ethics education. \nUNESCO\u201fs Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights states \u201cIn order to \npromote the principles set out in this Declaration and to achieve a better understanding \nof the ethical implications of scientific and technological developments, in particular for \nyoung people, States should endeavour to foster bioethics education and training at all \nlevels as well as to encourage information and knowledge dissemination programmes \nabout bioethics\u201d (UNESCO, 2005: Article 23). To this end, UNESCO has an Ethics \nEducation Programme aimed at initiating and supporting teaching in varied aspects of \nethics, including bioethics and professional standards. \n \nControversies and ongoing quandaries \nEver since the Educational Reform Act of 1988 heralded the introduction of the National \nCurriculum and the elevation of Science to a compulsory subject for all pupils to age 16, \nthere has been a tension concerning the purpose of science education. On the one hand \nthe scientists of tomorrow are the students of today and their schooling is important in \norder to put in place the building blocks upon which their later studies will be \nconstructed. At the same time, however, the vast majority of pupils taking Science up to \nand including GCSE will not continue to study science beyond the compulsory years and \na curriculum designed primarily with proto-scientists in mind will offer them little \nbenefit. At risk of sweeping generalisation, the traditional syllabuses have had their focus \non training the scientists of tomorrow, whereas the newer courses, including their \nemphasis on the ethical and moral implications of science, are aimed at promoting \nscientific literacy for all, whilst allowing the most interested to develop deeper factual \nknowledge via the appropriate Additional Science units. In this way it is hoped that a \ngreater proportion of the population will be equipped to understand real life science and \nto distinguish science for pseudo-science. \n \nPub science? Many people have welcomed the introduction of these changes, but their \nadoption has certainly not been universally popular. Shortly after the introduction of the \nnew GCSEs, Sir Richard Sykes, Rector of Imperial College, and Baroness Warnock \naccused them of being \u201cmore suitable to the pub than the schoolroom\u201d. A number of \nIndependent Schools, able to operate with greater curricular freedom than state schools, \nhave elected to switch their pupils onto International GCSE programmes, which have a \nmore traditional tenor.  \n \nEthics without substance? The criticism has also been raised that students need to have \nadequate grasp of the underlying science before they can discuss the ethical issues arising \nfrom the scientific breakthroughs. For example, it is necessary to have some \nunderstanding of normal cell division in order to properly evaluate the merits of stem cell \nresearch. We have always maintained the importance of scientific and ethics education \ngoing hand in hand, and can see the validity of criticisms if the science knowledge is left \nlanguishing behind. On the other hand, it is important that students are equipped not only \nwith answers to the ethics of a particular issue, but with an appropriate toolkit to know \nhow to address new ethical conundrums that arise outside of their formal schooling.  \n \nEthical theory? To this end, a different question arises, namely how much moral \nphilosophy is required in order to fairly represent an ethical discussion? The consensus, \nwhen debated by bioethics enthusiasts, seems to be not a lot, but almost certainly more \nthan most students are currently receiving. They should probably know, for example, that \narguments can arise from first principles or from outcomes, even if they do not use the \nterms deontological or consequentialist, nor know anything of Immanuel Kant or John \nStuart Mill. \n \nAssessment? Another persistent question involves appropriate assessment of bioethics. \nUnlike our colleagues in the humanities, we are not familiar with awarding marks for \nconstruction of argument and are more used to checking that the factual content was \npresent and correct. Exam boards at GCSE appear to be partially side-stepping this \ndifficulty by offering credit based on a student\u201fs ability to describe arguments presented \nfrom more than one perspective (without the necessity to come off the fence and defend \ntheir own views on the matter). \n \nMethodology? Even for those who are enthusiastic about increased ethical content in the \nbioscience curriculum, the changes have frequently necessitated the development of \napproaches to teaching that have hitherto been unfamiliar within science teaching, such \nas debate and role play. Dealing with opinions rather than \u201efact\u201f has also left some \nteachers feeling uncomfortable (as noted by Lewis (2006) in her report on the experience \nof teachers involved in the pilot programme for the SNAB course).  \n \nWill the myriad of changes achieve their goal of developing a scientifically literate \npublic? The sheer frequency with which ethically-important stories are reported in the \nmedia makes this a vital task, and one made urgent by evidence that the public are \ngenerally poorly equipped to understand the issues (see, for example, the now infamous \nEurobarometer survey in which 35% of Europeans agree to the statement, \"ordinary \ntomatoes do not contain genes while genetically modified tomatoes do\" and a further \n30% declared that they did not know; Europa, 1999). \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe are grateful to Dave Wickins and Bonnie Green for help and advice in setting up the \ninteractive online versions of the ethics curriculum tables.
