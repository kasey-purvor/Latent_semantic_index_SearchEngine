The indicative value of phytoplankton assemblages to \neutrophication has been recognized already for long time (Naumann 1919, Nygaard 1949), and \nnumerous researchers have developed indices for using phytoplankton composition for assessing \nwater quality (e.g. Teiling 1955;  Hornstr\u00f6m 1981; Orlik et al.1998; Will\u00e9n 2000).  \nA general problem with many proposed indicators is the lack of a critical statistical evaluation. \nOften, indicators are based on small datasets in combination with expert knowledge, and have not \nbeen evaluated by statistical methods. Also, indicators are often based on rather regional datasets, \nwhich were accessible to the person performing the analysis, and a wider applicability of such \nindicators appears questionable. \nA indicator should be representative for the area where it is going to be used. For the WFD, this \nmeans that indicators must be applicable to multinational areas. Because different experts in \ndifferent countries often use different taxonomic keys, combined datasets often cause problems \nwith respect to taxonomic identity of the biological elements (e.g. Moe et al. 2008, this issue). This \ncauses considerable problems when one develops indicators based on such datasets. On the \ncontrary, datasets aggregated on higher taxonomic levels (classes, orders) may be expected to be \nless affected by identifier-specific traits. \nOne of the key steps in the Water Framework Directive (WFD) implementation process is the \nassessment of ecological status of water bodies according to biological parameters and supporting \nphysico-chemical elements (European Commission 2000). The ecological status of the water \nbodies should be given as deviations from type-specific reference conditions. In order to develop \nWFD compliant classification systems for the assessment of ecological status, we need to know \n 3\nREBECCA MS no.04 \nquantitative the relationships between biological and physico-chemical factors for different types of \nwater bodies. According to the boundary setting protocol given by the intercalibration steering \ngroup (Intercalibration technical report 2007) type-specific response curves of different biological \nindicators \/indices along the pressure gradient should be used as a basis to recommend boundaries \nbetween the different classes of ecological status. This is the core of the pan-European \nintercalibration process of comparing and harmonizing ecological assessment systems \n(Intercalibration guidance 2005).  \nAccording to the WFD, phytoplankton is one of the biological key elements for assessment of \necological status in lakes. Both biomass as well as taxonomic composition should be used to assess \necological status (WFD Annex V). The most important environmental factor affecting \nphytoplankton biomass and community composition is eutrophication (Vollenweider 1989).  \nThe main objective of this study thus is to quantify responses of phytoplankton indicators to \neutrophication in major lake types in Northern Europe, as a basis for identification of type-specific \necological status class boundaries. A sub-objective is to test whether relationships are comparable \namong different countries and among lake types. For this purpose, we used a large dataset from \nNorthern European lakes to model responses of phytoplankton classes, expressed by their \nproportional biovolumes, along the eutrophication gradient, and test if these response curves vary \nbetween lake types. In addition to comparison among lake-types, we analyze where responses \ndiffer among countries. \nWe focus on highly aggregated groups (classes) rather than genera and species in order to warrant \nwide applicability of our metrics. Furthermore, this approach yields a more user-friendly index, \nsince classes are easier to monitor than lower taxonomic levels, such as genera or species. \n \nMaterial and Methods \n 4\nREBECCA MS no.04 \n1) Datasets  \nThe Northern European part of the REBECCA phytoplankton database consists of close to 5000 \nphytoplankton samples from app. 850 different lakes, mainly collected from various monitoring \nprograms in Norway, Sweden and Finland in the period from 1988 to 2003. To the best of our \nknowledge, this dataset, which has been assembled as a part of the EU-project REBECCA (Moe et \nal. 2008, this issue), is at present the largest combined dataset on phytoplankton composition in \nNorthern Europe. Additionally United Kingdom (UK) also provided data from a few sites for \ncomparison. Samples were mostly taken from the upper mixed surface layer of the lakes during the \ngrowing season. Thus, metalimnetic samples and winter samples are not included in our dataset. \nExcept for the UK, all samples from each country were counted by only one single expert from \neach country, ensuring high comparability of data within each country. These experts have for \nmany years participated in an ongoing process of standardization of phytoplankton counting \nmethods among the specialists from the Scandinavian countries (Vuorio et al. 2006), thereby \nproviding good comparability of data also between the countries. \n2) Selection of indicator classes  \nInitial analyses showed that especially chrysophytes, pennate diatoms and cyanobacteria respond \nclearly to lake eutrophication, as observed earlier by Watson et al. (1997). We therefore focus here \non these three taxonomic group indicators. Some taxa, which behave differently from the bulk of \nspecies within a class, were excluded from the indicator groups. The genera Synura and Uroglena \nwere excluded from the chrysophytes, because these genera are not indicative for oligotrophic \nconditions, but may indeed form blooms under eutrophic conditions (Brettum 1989). From the \ncyanobacteria, all chroococcales were excluded with exception of the genera Microcystis and \nWoronichinia, because chroococcales include mainly small-sized taxa which are common in \noligotrophic lakes (Komarek and Anagnostidis 1999). The selection of the taxa was preliminarily \n 5\nREBECCA MS no.04 \nbased on expert knowledge, and later evaluated and confirmed by statistical analysis, using \nweighted averaging of each taxon\u2019s abundance along the pressure gradient (data not shown). \n3) Lake types \nThe intercalibration of ecological assessment systems is based on the division of European water \nbodies into regions and lake types which are similar in their hydromorphological and geochemical \nproperties and therefore expected to have similar reference conditions (Table 1; see also Moe et al. \n2008, this issue). However, we combined lowland with upland lakes (L-N2a+L-N5, L-N3a+L-N6a, \nTable 1), because initial analyses did not show clear differences between those types.  \n4) Chlorophyll-a as a proxy for eutrophication \nChl-a was chosen as a proxy to express the level of eutrophication. because this proxy has been \nshown to correlate well with total phosphorus (Phillips et al. 2008,this issue and references \ntherein), and because preliminary analyses indicated more sensitive responses of phytoplankton \nclasses to Chl-a as compared to total phosphorus. Chl-a  also has the advantage of being \nindependent of whether nitrogen or phosphorus is the limiting factor for phytoplankton production. \nMoreover, Chl-a a also represents a more immediate measure for the effect of eutrophication than \nphosphorus, since phosphorus concentrations can be quite high without causing high algal biomass \n(e.g. in lakes with low retention time, in which there is too little time to build up a large \nphytoplankton biomass, or in lakes with high mineral turbidity, in which most of the phosphorus is \nunavailable for phytoplankton). Moreover, Chl-a has also been used as a measure for \nphytoplankton biomass and for boundary settings within the northern geographic intercalibration \ngroup (EU Intercalibration report 2007). \n5) Data selection for statistical analysis and seasonality \nIn order to analyse type-specific responses, we only used data from lakes that belonged to one of \nthe Northern GIG intercalibration types, thereby reducing the dataset to less than half of the total \n 6\nREBECCA MS no.04 \ndataset. Statistical evaluation was performed on basis of single samples, i.e. single samples from \neach lake were not averaged prior to analysis. In order to prevent the dataset from being dominated \nby sites (lakes) with a very large number of samples, we randomly selected four samples from sites \nwith more samples, but kept all observations from sites with up to four samples.  \nFor pennate diatoms, which peak during the spring bloom, a dataset ranging form May to July was \nselected, using above outlined sample selection approach. This \u2018spring bloom\u2019 dataset contained \n967 samples (Table 1). For the two remaining algal groups, samples taken from the period July to \nSeptember were selected by the same process. The final dataset used for analyses of these classes \ncontained 1000 samples (Table 1). \n6) Generalized additive models (GAM)  \nResponses of each taxonomic indicator group (chrysophytes, pennate diatoms and cyanobacteria) \nwere modeled using generalized additive models (GAMs; Wood 2006).  GAMs allow non-linear \nregressions to be fitted to the dataset, based on linear thin plate splines. In contrast to conventional \nsmoothing functions, GAMs include cross validation in the model-fitting routine (Wood 2006), \nwhich makes them robust against non-normal distribution of data and outliers. Also, GAMs give \nconfidence intervals for the regression line, which allow visual inspection of the significance of a \nrelationship. \n7) AIC model comparison \nWe tested whether relationships differ among lake-types and among countries using the Akaike \nInformation criterion (AIC; Sakamoto et al. 1986). For this purpose, two models were built, one \nwith the predictor (Chl-a) and the response variable estimated from the whole dataset for two lake \ntypes or two countries (e.g. proportion cyanobacteria vs. Chl-a concentration), and a second model, \nwhere a covariable split this dataset into two components (lake-type A and B, or country A and B). \nIf the AIC-value of the split model was clearly lower (at least by -2), the split model gave a \n 7\nREBECCA MS no.04 \nsignificantly better fit to the data than the joint model (Sakamoto et al. 1986). In these cases the \nsplit model was preferred, otherwise the simple (joint) model was preferred. All statistical analyses \nwere performed using the R software (R Development Core Team 2007). \n \nResults \nResponse curves \nDistinct patterns were found along the eutrophication gradient (as expressed by Chl-a) for all the \nthree indicator groups, and the patterns were qualitatively similar for most lake types (Fig. 1). The \nnarrow confidence intervals (Fig.1) show that the responses are significantly different from random \npatterns. \nChrysophytes \u2013 The relative biomass of chrysophytes decreased along the eutrophication gradient \nfor all Nordic lake types. While the proportion of chrysophytes was on average close to 40% below \n3 \u00b5g Chl-a L-1 in all lake types except L-N8a (Fig.1), their proportion became insignificant above \nca. 20 \u00b5g Chl-a L-1. \nPennate diatoms \u2013 In the clear-water lakes, the relative biomass of pennate diatoms increased \nbetween 2 and 10 \u00b5g L-1 Chl-a. However, their share in the total biomass leveled off or even \ndecreased as Chl-a concentration increased further. The response was comparable among lake \ntypes except for the moderate alkaline humic lakes (LN-8a), where the response of pennate diatoms \nfluctuated and was less distinct (Fig. 1b).  \nCyanobacteria \u2013 The proportions of cyanobacteria increased with increasing Chl-a concentration in \nall Nordic lake types, but relationships were overall less pronounced in humic compared to clear- \nwater lakes (Fig. 1). Compared to pennate diatoms, cyanobacteria started to increase at \nconsiderably higher Chl-a levels. The increase was not linear, but showed a sharp threshold that \ndiffered between lake types, at ca.  5-6 \u00b5g L-1 Chl-a  in the low alkalinity clearwater lakes (LN-2a, \n 8\nREBECCA MS no.04 \nLN-5) and at ca. 9-10 \u00b5g L-1 Chl-a in the moderate alkalinity clear-water type (LN-1) and in the \nlow alkalinity humic lake types (LN-3a, LN-6a).  \n \nDifferences between lake types \nUsing the AIC statistics, differences between lake types were tested for the three phytoplankton \nclass indicators (Table 2). The response of cyanobacteria in clearwater lakes was significantly \ndifferent from humic lakes, in terms of showing a weaker response in humic compared to \nclearwater lakes.  Within the clearwater lakes, the moderately alkaline lakes, L-N1, showed \ndifferent phytoplankton responses from the low alkalinity lakes, L-N2 and L-N5, with respect to \nchrysophytes and cyanobacteria, while the deep low alkalinity lakes, L-N2b, did not differ \nsignificantly from the other clearwater types for any of the tested indicators. Within the humic lake \ngroup, the moderately alkaline lakes (LN-8a) differed significantly only with respect to the \ncyanobacteria response curves.  \nDifference between countries \nDue to the large number of possible combinations, and due to limited number of observations for \nsome lake types and countries (Table 1), this comparison was restricted to the two major lake types \n(humic and clearwater lakes, Table 2). UK lakes were excluded from this comparison due to low \nnumber of observations (Table 1).  \nResponses differed quite clearly between countries. 9 out of 18 pairwise comparisons differed \nsignificantly (Table 3). Only the pennate diatoms did not differ significantly among the three \ncountries. Differences were most pronounced between Norway and Finland (4 of 6 comparisons \ndifferent) but less between Norway and Sweden (3 of 6) and between Finland and Sweden (2 of 6), \ncorresponding to geographic distances between countries. For chrysophytes, all pairwise \ncomparisons different significantly, except for the humic lakes in Sweden and Finland. For \n 9\nREBECCA MS no.04 \nCyanobacteria, the responses were different in each country for both the major lake types, except in \nFinland and Sweden for clearwater lakes, and for Norway and Sweden for humic lakes. Responses \nappear to be more pronounced in Norway compared to the other countries (Fig. 1) in the sense that \nproportions of Chrysophytes and Cyanobacteria both showed higher contrasts between oligo-and \neutrophic conditions than in Sweden and Finland. However, the Norwegian data covered a larger \npart of the Chl-a gradient than the Swedish and Finnish data, making the comparison difficult.  \nIn addition to differences seen in mean trends, also variations seem to differ among countries. The \nNorwegian data generally seems to be more variable compared to the data from Sweden and \nFinland (see range in proportions of cyanobacteria and chrysophytes at moderate Chl-a levels; Fig. \n1). However, the statistical evaluation applied here is restricted to comparisons of mean trends, thus \nsignificant differences as identified by the AIC criterion should reflect differences in mean trends, \nbut not in variations around the trend lines. \n \nDiscussion \nMajor response patterns and general ecological traits \nThe general decrease along the trophic gradient found for chrysophytes is a well-known ecological \nfeature of this class of often mixotrophic phytoplankton prevailing in the waters of oligotrophic \nlakes (Sandgren 1988, Lyche 1990). The underlying mechanism explaining the high relative \nabundance of chrysophytes in oligotrophic lakes is related to severe limitation in dissolved \ninorganic nutrients, and to the ability of chrysophytes to supplement their nutrient uptake with \nphagotrophy of bacteria and small phytoplankton. This ability allows mixotrophic chrysophytes  to \nmaintain positive growth rates under nutrient-poor conditions (Raven 1995).  \nLarge-sized, pennate diatoms were found to have their peak relative abundance at intermediate \ntrophic levels. The underlying causal factors for this response pattern may be related to the ability \n 10\nREBECCA MS no.04 \nof these algae to grow fast when there are more inorganic nutrients available (references in \nAndersen 1997). Moreover, their large cell size makes pennate diatoms less vulnerable to grazing \ncompared to smaller taxa.  \nThe dominance of Cyanobacteria at the upper end of the trophic gradient is also a well-known \nresponse pattern (Lyche 1990, Downing et al. 2001), often explained by their adaptation to low \nlight conditions, and their low vulnerability to grazing (Reynolds 1984).  \nDeep vs. shallow lakes  \nOur analyses did not show any significant differences between deep and shallow lakes among the \nlow alkalinity clear water lakes. Our data did not include observations from the metalimnion of \ndeep lakes. Thus, sub-surface blooms of cyanobacteria, which may be characteristic for moderately \neutrophicated deep lakes (e.g Teubner et al. 2001), are not represented in our dataset, limiting our \npossibilities to find potential differences between deep and shallow lakes in our study. \nImpact of humic substances \nThe lake typology of the WFD reflects major environmental gradients, and we therefore expected \ndifferences in responses among lake types. The weaker response of cyanobacteria in humic \ncompared to clearwater lakes is probably related to reduced supply of inorganic carbon as HCO3- in \nthose often acidic humic lakes in the Northern countries, as well as to shifts in light quality towards \nred light.  Most cyanobacteria depend on HCO3- as inorganic carbon source (Kohl and Nicklisch \n1988), making them poor competitors at low pH. Moreover, the light conditions in humic lakes \ndiminish the competitive advantage of cyanobacteria with respect to utilization of the light in the \n\u2018green gap\u2019 (Britton 1983).  \nImpact of alkalinity \nAmong clearwater lakes, cyanobacteria exhibited the most abrupt response to eutrophication in \nlow-alkaline lakes (L-N2a, L-N2b, L-N5, L-N6a), while the responses seem more buffered in the \n 11\nREBECCA MS no.04 \nmoderate alkaline lakes (L-N1, L-N8a). This phenomenon may be related to the more stable supply \nof inorganic carbon in the form of HCO3- found in moderately alkaline lakes. The Chl-a threshold \nabove which there was an abrupt increase in the relative abundance of Cyanobacteria was also \nlower in low alkalinity lakes (ca. 6 \u00b5g\/L) than in moderately alkaline lakes (ca. 9 \u00b5g\/L) (Fig.1a). \nResponse of cyanobacteria generally seems to be more variable, i.e. less predictable in low alkaline \ncompared to moderate alkaline lakes. \n \nAltogether, the results show that humic substances and alkalinity do have considerable impact on \nthe phytoplankton responses to eutrophication, and thus confirms that the WFD lake typology, \nwhich is mainly based on these two chemical factors, reflects ecological meaningful gradients, and \nmay be useful for lake management. \n \nGeographical  differences \u2013  \nDifferences in the datasets cause by methodological differences should be small, both due to the \nongoing standardization work among the phytoplankton experts in the Nordic countries (Vuorio et \nal. 2006), and due to the low taxonomic resolution applied for definition of the indicator groups \n(class level). Thus, the observed differences between the countries most likely reflect true \ndifferences, caused by geological and climatic gradients producing differences in hydrology and \nwater quality. \nHumic matter, pH, alkalinity and retention time all increase from west to east across the study area \n(Skjelkv\u00e5le et al. 2001). This was further supported by results found for our dataset that pH and \nalkalinity increase from west to east in Scandinavia (Spearman rank correlation between longitude \nand alkalinity (n=700) and pH (n=947); rho=0.36 (alk.), 0.56 (pH),  p(alk., pH)<0.001). pH and \nalkalinity are essential factors affecting phytoplankton dynamics and composition (see low vs \n 12\nREBECCA MS no.04 \nmoderate alkaline lakes,  above). The study area is also characterized by a strong east-west \ngradient in climate, with mild winters and wet and cool summers in western Norway, and \npronounced seasonality with cold winters and dry and sunny summers in the eastern Sweden and \nFinland. Moreover, lake morphometry differs systematically among the Nordic countries (Fig. 2). \nThe lakes tend to be large and shallow in Finland, but deep and small in Norway. Swedish lakes are \nsimilar in size to Norwegian lakes, but more shallow. Also the humic substances increase from \nwest to east and give more coloured lakes in Finland than in Norway, again with Sweden in the \nmiddle. This difference in humic content has implications both for the carbon source available for \nphytoplankton, as well as for the underwater light climate. Thus, the climatic, morphometric, as \nwell as the physico-chemical variability across the study area likely causing systematic trends in \nimportant variables such as light conditions, mixing depth and stability of the upper mixed layer, \nwhich may have substantial effects on phytoplankton communities (Reynolds 1984, Ptacnik et al. \n2003).  \nA recent study shows that phytoplankton diversity and predictability of community composition \nare positively related (Ptacnik et al. 2008). Because phytoplankton diversity increases form west to \neast in the study area (Fig. 1 in Ptacnik et al. 2008), the differences in variation seen between \ncountries may well relate to differences in phytoplankton diversity in the study area. \nConclusions \nSince these phytoplankton classes show significant trends along the eutrophication gradient, they \nmay be useful as indicators for eutrophication in lakes in Northern Europe. As we have shown, the \nthree classes indicate different levels of productivity, with chrysophytes, pennate diatoms and \ncyanobacteria dominating in oligotrophic, mesotrophic and eutrophic lakes respectively. The \nthresholds shown for cyanobacteria may be especially useful for setting boundaries between good \nand moderate ecological status in Northern lakes. Provided that geographic gradients are taken into \naccount, our data also show that the WFD typology system is useful in lake management. \n 13\nREBECCA MS no.04 \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe thank Jannicke Moe and Gunner Severinsen for help with the REBECCA database, Laurence \nCarvalho for support with data from UK, and three reviewers for their constructive comments to \nearlier versions of this article. \n \nReferences \nAndersen T (1997) Pelagic nutrient cycles: Herbivores as sources and sinks.
