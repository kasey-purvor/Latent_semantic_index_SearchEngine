We study electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) of a weakly\ninteracting cold Rydberg gas. We show that for Rydberg states with principal quantum\nnumbers in the range n = 19\u221226, the onset of interactions is manifest as a depopulation\nof the Rydberg state. In the limit of a weak probe where the depopulation effect is\nnegligible, we observe no evidence of interaction induced decoherence and obtain a\nnarrow Rydberg dark resonance with a linewidth of <600 kHz.\nPACS numbers: 03.67.Lx, 32.80.Rm, 42.50.Gy\nEnsembles of Rydberg atoms display fascinating many-body behavior due to their\nstrong interactions [1]. These interactions lead to interesting cooperative effects such\nas superradiance [2, 3, 4] and dipole blockade [5, 6, 7, 8], which may provide the basis\nfor applications such as single\u2013photon sources [9] and quantum gates [10, 11, 12]. For\nquantum information applications one is interested in the coherent evolution of the\nensemble. Coherent excitation of Rydberg states has been achieved using adiabatic\npassage [13, 14]. Rabi oscillations between ground and Rydberg states with dipole\u2013\ndipole interactions have been observed [15, 16]. Also, the coherence of a Rydberg\nensemble has been measured directly using a spin echo technique [17]. In most\nexperiments on ultracold Rydberg gases, the Rydberg atoms are detected indirectly\nfollowing field ionization and subsequent detection of electrons (or ions) using a micro\nchannel plate (MCP). However, recently we demonstrated non-destructive optical\ndetection of Rydberg states in room temperature Rb vapor [18, 19] using EIT [20, 21].\nThe same technique was subsequently used to detect Rydberg states in a Sr atomic\nbeam [22]. Rydberg EIT has number of potential applications, for example, a Rydberg\nEIT medium displays a giant dc electro\u2014optic effect many orders of magnitude larger\nthan other systems [23] enabling precision electrometry, and Rydberg EIT could be\nused to a realize a photonic phase gate [24]. However, exactly how interaction effects\nare manifest in Rydberg EIT, e.g. as a dipole-dipole induced level shift, decoherence or\nloss is unknown.\n2Figure 1. (Color online) (a) Schematic of the experimental setup. A strong coupling\nbeam (blue) stabilized to the 5p 2P3\/2 \u2192 nD (or nS) transition counter\u2013propagates a\nweak probe beam (red) through a cold sample of 85Rb released from a magneto\u2013optical\ntrap (MOT). The probe scans over a range of \u00b120 MHz about the F = 3 \u2192 F \u2032 = 4\nresonance in 480 \u00b5s. (b) Simplified level scheme, Rabi frequencies and decay rates used\nto model the Rydberg EIT. Levels |4\u3009 represent states other than state |2\u3009 to which\nthe Rydberg state |3\u3009 can decay.\nIn this work we demonstrate EIT involving Rydberg states in an ultra\u2013cold atomic\nsample. We show that interactions between Rydberg atoms lead to a rapid depopulation\nof the Rydberg state, and that the EIT spectra are extremely sensitive to small changes\nin the interaction strength. For example, changing the principal quantum number of\nthe Rydberg state from n to n + 1 produces a significant change in the EIT spectrum.\nBy using a weak probe, where the probability of populating the Rydberg state is low,\nwe can eliminate this depopulation effect and obtain narrow Rydberg dark resonances\nwith a linewidth of < 600 kHz.\nThe experimental setup and simplified level scheme are shown in figure 1 (a) and\n(b) respectively. A probe and coupling beam are combined using dichroic mirrors and\ncounter\u2013propagate through a cloud of laser\u2013cooled 85Rb atoms. The polarization of\nthe beams are chosen to maximize transition strengths (\u03c3+\u2013\u03c3+). The probe beam is\nderived from a diode laser at 780.24 nm stabilized to the |1\u3009 \u2192 |2\u3009, 5s 2S1\/2(F = 3)\n\u2192 5p 2P3\/2 (F \u2032 = 4) transition using polarization spectroscopy [25]. The frequency is\ncontrolled using two successive acousto-optic modulators (AOMs). The beam is then\ncoupled into an optical fiber, the output of which is collimated and passed through\nan aperture resulting in a beam of almost uniform intensity and radius of 0.75 mm.\nThe coupling beam is derived from a commercial frequency doubled diode laser system\n(Toptica TA-SHG) at \u03bb=483\u2013487 nm resonant with the |2\u3009 \u2192 |3\u3009, 5p 2P3\/2 (F \u2032 = 4) \u2192\nnd 2D5\/2 (or ns\n2S1\/2) (F\n\u2032\u2032) transition and passed through an optical fiber. The beam\nhas a 1\/e2 radius of 0.8 mm and power up to 97 mW. The frequency of the coupling laser\nis stabilized using a Rydberg EIT signal produced in a magnetically shielded rubidium\n3vapor cell at room temperature [26].\nWe load approximately 108 atoms in a magneto\u2013optical trap (MOT) in 5 s.\nA subsequent 10 ms optical molasses phase cools the atoms to a temperature of\napproximately 20 \u00b5K and density 1010 cm\u22123, following which the cooling light is\nextinguished. An optical pumping pulse of variable duration prepares the atoms in the\nF = 3,mF = 3 state. After 3 ms free expansion the coupling and probe beams are turned\non and the frequency of the probe is swept across the D2 F = 3 \u2192 F \u2032 = 4 transition.\nThe sweep covers \u00b1 20 MHz on either side of the resonance in 480 \u00b5s. Absorption\nmeasurements show that there is negligible density decrease over the duration of the\nscan and negligible optical pumping into the lower (F = 2) hyperfine ground state for\nthe probe powers of interest. The probe beam is incident on a fast photodiode which\nrecords the transmission through the sample. This technique of measuring the narrow\nlinewidth EIT spectra from a cold atomic sample within a single experimental cycle offers\na faster repetition rate than ionization experiments. In addition Rydberg EIT provides\na continuous probe of the Rydberg energy level with a bandwidth limited by the larger\nof the linewidth of the intermediate state or the two\u2013photon Rabi frequency [23]. A\ndisadvantage of Rydberg EIT is that one only obtains information about the population\nin the ground state and the coupled Rydberg state. In contrast, state-selective field\nionisation techniques where the population in other Rydberg states can be detected is\nbetter suited to studying population transfer processes.\nIn figure 2 we show a series of EIT spectra for a fixed probe power of 3.6 \u00b5W\ncorresponding to 0.13 Isat, where Isat is the saturation intensity on the |1\u3009 \u2192 |2\u3009\ntransition. The absorption data has been corrected for the measured change in probe\nintensity through the optical fiber as a function of AOM frequency. The effect of varying\nthe cloud density, \u03c1, and principal quantum number, n, are shown in figures 2 (a) and\n(b), respectively. The density, \u03c1, is changed by heating the atom cloud (of initial density\n\u03c10) with the probe beam prior to the EIT scan. In figure 2 (b) the power of the coupling\nlaser is varied to make the coupling Rabi frequency the same for each scan. For low \u03c1 or\nlow n a characteristic EIT spectrum is observed with a slight asymmetry. As \u03c1 or n are\nincreased this asymmetry becomes more pronounced until the transparency peak is lost\ncompletely. The lineshape for n > 22 does not change dramatically with n as illustrated\nby the similarity to the n = 26 and n = 22 data sets, the front curves in figure 2 (a) and\n(b), respectively. The data presented in figure 2 is suggestive of a density\u2013dependent\ndepopulation of the Rydberg state.\nBy varying the probe power we can change the fractional probability that an atom\nis excited to the Rydberg state. In figure 3 we show the transmission spectrum for the\n|3\u3009=19d state for two probe powers of 450 nW (0.016 Isat) and 3.6 \u00b5W (0.13 Isat). In\nthis case we present double scans where the probe laser detuning is first increased and\nthen decreased through the resonance in a total time of 960 \u00b5s. We observe that at the\nhigher probe power there is significantly less absorption on the second scan than the first\nindicating that atoms excited to the Rydberg state are being lost from the EIT system.\nFor these parameters only a small fraction of the population, a few percent, is transferred\n4Figure 2. (Color online) (a) Transmission of a 3.6 \u00b5W probe beam as a function of\nprobe laser detuning for the 85Rb |1\u3009 \u2192 |2\u3009 \u2192 |3\u3009 = 26d system for varying atomic\ndensity. Constant coupling beam power of 97 mW (b) EIT spectra for n=19\u201322. The\nRabi frequency of the |2\u3009 \u2192 |3\u3009 transition is kept the same for each state varying from\n61 mW for n = 19 to 74 mW for n = 22. In both plots the onset of density\u2013dependent\nbehavior is evident in the emergence of an EIT lineshape at lower values of n and \u03c1\ninto and out of the Rydberg state for a time of order 10 \u00b5s. However, to model the\ndata (see next paragraph) we find that >70% of the atoms are lost from the 3-level EIT\nsystem. This substantial loss cannot be explained by spontaneous decay from Rydberg\nstate (since the spontaneous lifetime is also of order \u223c10 \u00b5s [27] and decreases with larger\nn) or by optical pumping to the lower hyperfine state. We therefore deduce that there\nis an interaction induced loss from the system happening on a much faster time scale\nthan the Rydberg state lifetime. In addition, with the available frequency resolution we\nare unable to resolve any dipole-dipole induced shift which is not unexpected for the\nRydberg density and principal quantum numbers accessible in the current study.\nTo describe this interaction\u2013induced depopulation we add non-linear density\ndependent decay and decoherence terms to the standard three-level optical Bloch\nequations [21]:\ni~\u03c3\u02d9 = [H, \u03c3]\u2212 \u03b3\u03c3 (1)\nwhere \u03c3 is the density matrix, H the atom-light interaction Hamiltonian and \u03b3\u03c3 the\ndecoherence matrix. The depopulation of the Rybderg state is modeled by introducing\na fourth level |4\u3009 to represent the reservoir of states other than |2\u3009 to which an atom in\nRydberg state |3\u3009 could decay, as shown in figure 1 (b). The decay of the Rydberg state\n|3\u3009 is given by \u03b33\u03c333+\u03b3\u20323\u03c3233 where the first term is due to spontaneous emission and the\nsecond term is a density-dependent interaction induced loss to the reservoir states |4\u3009.\nThe spontaneous decay rates of states |2\u3009 and |3\u3009 are given by \u03b32 and \u03b33, respectively. We\nassume that 50% of the spontaneous decay from |3\u3009 populates state |2\u3009 and 50% is lost\n5to the reservoir |4\u3009, however this weighting makes little difference to the lineshape as it\nis the non-linear term, \u03b3\n\u2032\n3, that dominates. Atoms decay from |4\u3009 to |1\u3009 at a rate \u03b34. The\ncoherences are assumed to decay at half the rate of the populations. The decoherence\nrate between |1\u3009 and |3\u3009, \u03b331, is included as a fitting parameter which depends on the\ncombined laser linewidth and dephasing due to Rydberg atom interactions. The optical\nBloch equations are then solved using a time varying probe detuning to match the\nexperimental sequence. As the probe is swept through the two\u2013photon resonance the\nRydberg state is first populated and then depopulated by chirped adiabatic passage, in\ncontrast to conventional adiabatic passage schemes where the transfer is unidirectional\n[13, 14]. The predictions of the model are compared to the experimental spectra in\nfigure 3. The model accurately reproduces the observed spectra for different values\nof the probe laser intensity (all other parameters remain the same). When the probe\nintensity is increased the population of the Rydberg state (solid lines in the lower panel\nof figure 3) also increases and there is a faster decay into the reservoir states (dotted line\nin the lower panel of figure 3). For a higher probe power of 3.4 \u00b5W the model predicts\nthat the maximum population of the coupled Rydberg state is only 2%, however, after\nthe double scan sequence 76% of the population is in other states, |4\u3009.\n0 0.12 0.24 0.36 0.48 0.6 0.72 0.84 0.96\n0\n0.5\n1\nTime(ms)\nPo\npu\nla\ntio\nn\n\u221210 0 10 10 0 \u221210\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nProbe Detuning (MHz)\nTr\nan\nsm\nis\nsi\non\nFigure 3.

The parameters used in the fit are \u03b33 = 2pi \u00b7 21 kHz and the peak value of\n\u03b3\u20323\u03c333 = 2pi \u00b7 216 kHz and 2pi \u00b7 960 kHz for the 450 nW and 3.4 \u00b5W scans respectively.\nAlthough there is a number of possible mechanisms for the loss of Rydberg atoms\nfrom the system, eg. dipole-dipole energy transfer [28], the most likely conjecture for\nlow n states is that the decay out of the EIT system is driven by superradiant decay of\nthe Rydberg state to nearby f and p states. Observation of similar loss dynamics from\nnearby s states support this supposition as the dipole\u2013dipole interactions are repulsive\n(attractive) for s (d) states [29]. The potential importance of superradiance in frozen\n6Rydberg gases particularly involving lower n states has been highlighted in recent work\n[4, 30]. In general superradiance is more significant for low n as the decay rate to nearby\nRydberg levels scales as 1\/n5, however there is also a geometrical effect which depends\non the wavelength of the superradiant transition, \u03bbs, in comparison to the size of the\ncloud, D [30]. For the range of n studied in this work (n = 19 to 26) \u03bbs is less than D\nfor decay to the closest f states i.e. the atoms are spatially spread over a range greater\nthan the transition wavelength such that cooperative effects are small. However, \u03bbs is\nof order or greater than D for decay to the closest p states i.e. all atoms are within\none wavelength and the emission rate is greatly enhanced. In this critical region the\ngeometric cooperativity parameter [30] increases rapidly with increasing n which could\nexplain the dramatic evolution of EIT spectra shown in figure 2 (b). The dependence of\nsuperradiance on \u03bbs and D is supported by the similarity of figure 2 (a) and (b) where\nfor both data sets the value of \u03bbsD varies by a factor of 1.6 between the front and back\ntrace [31]. Our simple non\u2013linear optical Bloch equation model begins to fail for larger\nn. For example, for the high density 26d trace shown in figure 2 (a) no evidence of\nEIT is observable whereas the model predicts a pronounced shoulder after the laser has\npassed through the two\u2013photon resonance. We also note that one can obtain a better\nfit to the high density and higher n data by coupling the optical Bloch equations to\nan equation describing the superradiance field energy density. This model reproduces\nthe lineshapes observed in the experiment, in particular the complete loss of the EIT\nshoulder, however as the time scale of the decay of the superradiance field is not known,\nthis model does not provide useful quantitative information. The current experimental\narrangement precludes the unambiguous identification of the depopulation mechanism\nsince neither ionized atoms or superradiant emissions (with wavelength in the range\nof 1 mm) can be detected directly. Further evidence could be obtained by performing\nexperiments for a larger range of n, however, for the current geometry (approximately\nspherical excitation volume with diameter 1 mm) we are limited to n . 26 by the\navailable coupling laser power (80 mW).\nOf more interest to applications in non-linear optics [23], high resolution\nspectroscopy and electrometry is the weak probe limit where the population of the\nRydberg state is small. This limit highlights the power of EIT as a non-destructive\ncontinuous probe of Rydberg states. Figure 4 shows the transmission spectrum for\nthe |3\u3009=26d state using a low probe power of 200 nW (0.007 Isat). In this case no\nloss or additional decoherence of the Rydberg state is observed between the forward\nand back scan. We obtain a typical EIT linewidth of 600 kHz. The EIT linewidth is\nmade up of two terms; a term proportional to the coupling Rabi frequency squared, \u2126232\n(i.e. the Autler\u2013Townes splitting), and a term corresponding to the coherence between\nthe ground state and the Rydberg state, \u03b331. This coherence term is the sum of the\ncombined laser linewidth and interaction dependent dephasing mechanisms. From the\nfit we obtain \u212632\/2pi = 1.8\u00b10.3 MHz and \u03b331 = 100\u00b120 kHz, i.e. for our parameters the\nlinewidth is dominated by the Autler-Townes term. We observe no change in \u03b331 over\nthe range n = 19 to n = 26 showing that the combined laser linewidth dominates over\n7any interaction induced dephasing of the Rydberg state. Note that such long coherence\ntimes cannot be observed in non\u2013Rydberg cascade EIT due to the short lifetime of\nthe upper state. The frequency resolution obtained using this method is comparable\nto the best obtained on single atoms [15] and considerably better than the resolution\nobtained for other ensembles experiments [16, 32, 33], where interaction effects tend to\nbroaden the linewidth to greater than one MHz. This narrow resonance demonstrates\na significant advantage of EIT for precision spectroscopy or electrometry, i.e. that\nthe observed transparency is sensitive to the Rydberg energy level without transferring\nsignificant population into it. From the OBE model we find that the probability for an\natom to be in the Rydberg state to be \u223c0.15% giving \u03c1 < 107 cm\u22123 which corresponds\nto a total Rydberg population of less than 104 atoms.\n0 0.12 0.24 0.36 0.48 0.6 0.72 0.84 0.96\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\nTime(ms)P\nop\nul\nat\nio\nn \n(x1\n0\u2212\n3 )\n\u221210 0 10 10 0 \u221210\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nProbe Detuning (MHz)\nTr\nan\nsm\nis\nsi\non\nFigure 4.

We find that for principal quantum numbers in the\nrange n = 19\u221226, interaction effects are manifest as a rapid depopulation of the Rydberg\nstate. This density dependent loss can be modeled heuristically using non\u2013linear optical\nBloch equations. The character of the loss is similar for changes in either the atomic\ndensity or the principal quantum n of the Rydberg state, suggesting a superradiant decay\nmechanism. In the limit of weak probe power, where the depopulation effect is negligible\nwe observe no evidence of interaction induced decoherence and the linewidth is limited\nby the Autler\u2013Townes splitting. In this limit EIT provides a sensitive non\u2013destructive\nprobe of cold Rydberg ensembles. In contrast to conventional spectroscopy, Rydberg\nEIT allows one to probe Rydberg energy levels continuously without significant Rydberg\npopulation thereby interaction induced line broadening mechanisms can be controlled\nallowing high\u2013resolution spectroscopy of Rydberg states. In future work we will focus\n8on extending the range of Rydberg EIT to smaller excitation volumes and states with\nhigher principal quantum numbers, where dipole-dipole induced energy level shift are\nexpected to dominate over superradiant decay.\nWe are grateful to PF Griffin for experimental assistance, IG Hughes, MPA Jones,\nT Pfau, and TG Walker for stimulating discussions and to SL Cornish for the loan of\nequipment.
