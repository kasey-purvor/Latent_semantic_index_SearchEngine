Attention has been\nfirst focused on the design of a hingeless flexible trailing edge (TE) control surface. Two innova-\ntive design features have been created in the SAW TE section: an open sliding TE and a curved\nbeam and disc actuation mechanism. This type of actuated TE section allows for the SAW having\na camber change in a desirable shape and minimum control power demand. This design concept\nhas been simulated numerically and demonstrated by a test model. For a small air vehicle of large\nsweep back wing, it is noted that significant structural weight saving can be achieved. However,\nfurther weight saving is mainly restricted by the aeroelastic stability and minimum number of car-\nbon\/epoxy plies in a symmetric layup rather than the structural strength. Therefore, subsequent\neffort was made to optimize the primary wing box structure. The results show that an initial struc-\ntural weight can be reduced significantly under the strength criterion. The resulting reduction\nof the wing box stiffness and aeroelastic stability and control effectiveness can be improved by\napplying the aeroelastic tailoring. Because of the large swept angle and resulting lightweight and\nhighly flexible SAW, geometrical non-linearity and large bending\u2013torsion aeroelastic coupling\nhave been considered in the analysis.\nKeywords: seamless aeroelastic wing, flexible trailing edge section, control effectiveness, aero-\nelastic tailoring\n1 INTRODUCTION\nThe feasibility of active aeroelastic wing technology\n(AAWT) has been demonstrated and studied by many\nresearch programmes [1, 2]. An alternative technol-\nogy for achieving flapless flight of an unmanned\nair vehicle (UAV) is currently under development in\nthe Flapless Air Vehicle Integrated Industry Research\n(FLAVIIR) programme [3]. The primary aim of the\nproject reported in this paper is to design a seam-\nless aeroelastic wing (SAW) structure applicable to a\nlightweight UAV. This article is focused on an opti-\nmal design of a SAW structure. Although similar to\nthe AAWT and relevant to the FLAVIIR, one distinct\ndifference from them is that a SAW will function as\nan integrated lifting surface with hingeless control\n\u2217Corresponding author: Department of Aerospace Engineering,\nCranfield University, Cranfield, Bedfordshire MK43 0AL, UK.\nemail: s.guo@cranfield.ac.uk\nsurface. Unlike the conventional hinged flap or uncon-\nventional coanda jet flow [3], SAW is designed to form\na desirable wing camber for control by deflecting a\nhingeless flexible trailing edge (TE) section. The SAW\nconcept has main advantages of improved aerody-\nnamic efficiency (high lift\/drag ratio, etc.), increased\noperational flexibility, less concentrated hinge load,\nand potential structure weight saving. The main chal-\nlenge of this project is to design a feasible, simple, reli-\nable, and lightweight SAW structure and its actuation\nmechanism.\nIn this current investigation, attention has been first\npaid to the design of a SAW with a flexible TE section\nas a hingeless control surface. Within the TE section, a\ncurved beam and disc design based on a design con-\ncept [4] has been used. At the TE, an innovative open\nsliding TE has been designed for large TE deflection\nin desirable shape and minimum demand for control\npower. A physical model has been built to demonstrate\nand prove this design concept. For a lightweight and\nlow-speed UAV, wing load is usually relatively small\nJAERO493 Proc. IMechE Vol. 223 Part G: J. Aerospace Engineering\n1142 M Perera and S Guo\neven with a large limit-load factor. For this kind of UAV\nhaving a large sweep back wing, significant structural\nweight saving is mainly constrained by aeroelastic\nstability and manufacture of carbon\/epoxy compos-\nite rather than the usual strength criterion. Therefore\nfurther effort was made to optimize the SAW struc-\nture for a minimum weight and maximum aeroelastic\nstability.\nComposite materials are employed for the wing\nstructure mainly due to their favourable high spe-\ncific strength and stiffness. In addition, fibre reinforced\ncomposites offer great potential for optimizing the\nfibre orientations and achieving desirable directional\nstiffness and aeroelastic behaviour with less weight\npenalty. Some previous work in aeroelastic tailoring\nhas demonstrated that the divergent speed of a for-\nward swept wing can be increased by optimizing the\nlaminate layup [5\u20137]. The elastic or stiffness coupling\ndue to an unsymmetrical laminate layup could also\nhave significant effect on the aeroelastic behaviour\nof a composite wing [8, 9]. Therefore investigations\nhave been carried out in order to optimize the lami-\nnate layup of a composite wing structure for desirable\naeroelastic behaviours [10\u201313]. Because of the flexibil-\nity and large sweep angle of the current SAW, flutter\nand control effectiveness are the main design con-\nstraints and bending\u2013torsion stiffness coupling is a key\ndesign factor in aeroelastic tailoring.\nPrevious research has shown that a gradient-based\ndeterministic method (GBDM) based on a continu-\nous and finite gradient of objective function at each\nstep of the process is suitable for aeroelastic tailor-\ning [14, 15]. This method is computationally more effi-\ncient than a genetic algorithm (GA) method based on a\nstochastic procedure [16, 17]. In this article, therefore,\nthe GBDM is employed for the SAW structure opti-\nmization to achieve a lightweight, adequate strength,\nand aeroelastic stability design. The optimal design\nwas conducted in two stages. First, effort was made\nto design and model a composite wing for a mini-\nmum weight structure option. An analytical method\nwas used for structural stress, vibration, and aeroe-\nlastic analyses. The NASTRAN package based on the\nfinite-element method (FEM) was also used for struc-\ntural analysis and comparison. Second, attention was\nfocused on aeroelastic tailoring of the basic compos-\nite wing model to achieve the maximum flutter speed\nunder the strength criterion.\n2 SAWDESIGN\nCurved beam within a flexible TE section: an eccen-\ntric beam design concept for deflecting a flexible wing\ncontrol surface was initiated by the DARPA SmartWing\nproject [18]. Eccentuation was a concept developed in\nthe 1970s for variable camber control surfaces. This\nconcept proposes a curved beam called an eccen-\ntuator to convert a rotational input motion into a\nvertical and lateral displacement at the output end\n(Fig. 1) [4, 17]. The output end of the curved beam\nis connected to a bearing surface moving up or down\ndepending on the direction of the beam rotation. At 90\u25e6\nrotation, the control surface is fully deployed, and zero\nactuation force is required because the entire exter-\nnal load is transferred into the substructure. One of\nthe disadvantages in this design was the accompa-\nnying spanwise and chordwise lateral motion of the\nbeam, which results in a sliding motion within a car-\nrier cylinder [4]. Since this concept leads to a simple\nmechanism, it is adapted and improved in the current\nSAW actuation mechanism design. Figure 2(a) illus-\ntrates the current curved beam and disc configuration\nused to replace the above original design concept.\nDesign improvement has been made in dealing with\nthe beam lateral motion and connection to the skins.\nIn this SAW design, discs are mounted on the beam\nand their edges are kept contact with the upper and\nlower skin stiffeners as illustrated in Fig. 2(a). The discs\nof different sizes along the beam are used to maintain\nthe TE section shape as the beam rotates. The discs are\nmounted at different angles to the beam axis to keep\nthe disc edges move in a straight track on the spanwise\nstiffeners for minimum chordwise sliding and friction.\nThe actuator torque is distributed to the discs through\nthe beam and converted to compressive forces act-\ning on the skin stiffeners to bend the skin and deflect\nthe TE section. The bending moment produced by the\nskin elastic force and aerodynamic pressure can be\ncalculated in order to work out the required actuation\ntorque and power.\nTo produce the required SAW TE deflection with\nminimum actuation power, an open TE has been\ndesigned to allow for a certain warping. As illustrated\nin Fig. 2(b), two metallic sheets are bonded to the TE\nupper and lower skin and one of the edges is folded\nto cover another. This open-edge design allows the\nFig. 1 The eccentuator mechanism [17]\nProc. IMechE Vol. 223 Part G: J.

It is a NACA0015 airfoil section of 200 mm chord-\nwise and 100 mm spanwise. The skin is made of four\nlayers of glass fibre polyester prepreg in 0\/90 layup.\nThe spars and stiffeners are made of wood. The front\nspar is positioned at 20 per cent chord and rear spar\nat 50 per cent chord together with a mid spar at 40\nper cent. A servomotor mounted to the mid spar pro-\nduces a torque of 37.3 N m at 4.8V. A curved beam\nis connected to the motor and is supported by the\nrear spar through a bearing and connected to a skin-\nstiffeners cover in the flexible TE section. These four\nstiffeners are in touch with the rotating beam, and\nthus transfer the actuating force to the skin bending\naction and TE deflection up or down in the required\nshape. Two more stiffeners are bonded to the skin\nabove and below the motor to reinforce the skin and\nmotor mounting against the reaction torque in oper-\nation. The deflected shape of the test model is shown\nin Fig. 3(c).\n3 ANALYTICALMETHODS\n3.1 Structural model and analysis\nIn this investigation, a full-scale sweep back rectangu-\nlar wing model is created for a small UAV. The wing\nstructure is made of the front and rear spars, ribs,\nand stringer reinforced skins. Based on the SAW design\nconcept, most of the load on the flexible TE section is\ntransferred to the rear spar through the curved beam.\nSince the wing box enclosed by the spars is the main\nload carrier, the modelling and analysis are focused\non the wing box structure. In the structural model,\nthe wing box was divided into a number of spanwise\nsegments and each of them was modelled as a uni-\nform thin-walled single-cell box beam as illustrated in\nFig. 4, and the whole wing structure was modelled as\nan assembly of those box beams.\nBased on the analytical method by Armanios\nand Badir [19], a relationship between the bend-\ning moment Mx , torque My , and the transverse and\ntwist deflections at the end of an anisotropic thin-\nwalled closed-section beam, as shown in Fig. 4(b), are\nexpressed below\nMy = C22\u03c6\u2032 + C23h\u2032\u2032 and Mx = C23\u03c6\u2032 + C33h\u2032\u2032 (1)\nJAERO493 Proc.

According to the\nforce\u2013deflection relationships in equation (1) and\nstiffness definition, the stiffness coefficients C33, C22,\nand C23 actually represent the bending, torsion, and\nbending\u2013torsion coupling rigidities of the wing box\nbeam, which are usually expressed by symbols EI, GJ,\nand CK, respectively. Contribution of the six stringers\nto the wing box bending stiffness is also included in\nthe model.\nThe dynamic stiffness matrix method [20, 21] was\nsubsequently used for the vibration analysis. In this\nmethod, the equations of motion for each of the thin-\nwalled box beams were represented as follows, where\nthe bending\u2013torsion stiffness coupling was included\nbut the transverse shear deformation and warping\neffect were neglected\nEI h\n\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032 + CK \u03c6 \u2032\u2032\u2032 + mh\u00a8 \u2212 mX\u03b1 \u03c6\u00a8 = 0 (4)\nGJ \u03c6\n\u2032\u2032 + CK h\u2032\u2032\u2032 + mX\u03b1 h\u00a8 \u2212 Ip \u03c6\u00a8 = 0 (5)\nwhere h\n\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032 = \u22024h\/\u2202y4, h\u00a8 = \u22022h\/\u2202t2, \u03c6 \u2032\u2032\u2032 = \u22023h\/\u2202y3, and\n\u03c6\u00a8 = \u22022h\/\u2202t2. By solving the differential equations, an\nexact solution for the transverse displacement h(y)\nand twist \u03c6(y) can be obtained. A dynamic stiffness\nmatrix for a box beam can be subsequently created\nby relating the displacements to the bending moment\nand torque at both ends of the beam. A dynamic\nstiffness matrix for the whole wing box structure is\nobtained by assembling all the wing box beam stiffness\nmatrices along the wing span direction.\nThe stress distribution at the wing root section was\nused to evaluate the local forces acting on the skin lam-\ninate at the critical region. Based on the force, stresses\nand failure index (FI) in each ply of the skin laminate\nwere calculated based on the laminate theory [22].\n3.2 Aeroelastic analysis\nIt is noted that the dynamic stiffness matrix is actu-\nally a combination of stiffness and mass matrices of\nthe beam and is frequency dependant [14]. Since this\nparticular type of matrix produces a non-standard\neigenvalue problem, it is solved by using the Wittrick\u2013\nWilliam algorithm [23]. By employing the normal\nmode method, the flutter equation for a wing can be\nwritten in generalized coordinates as\n{\n[KD(\u03c9)] \u2212 12\u03c1V\n2[QA]R + i\u03c9[D]\n+ i 1\n2\n\u03c1V 2[QA]I\n}\n{q} = 0 (6)\nThe unsteady aerodynamic forces were calculated\nby using the classical Therdorsen theory [24, 25] and\nthe strip method use in incompressible airflow. The\nabove equation was solved for flutter speed by using\nthe V\u2212g method in an iterative process. For static\naeroelastic analysis, the aerodynamic coefficients for\neach of the wing sections with deflected TE are cal-\nculated by employing the panel method [24]. By the\nassembly of the spanwise beam models and two-\ndimensional aerodynamic forces, the static aeroelastic\nequation of the wing can be established and written in\nmatrix form as\n[K]{d} = [AF (d, \u03b4TE, \u03b4LE)] (7)\nwhere [K] is the stiffness matrix of the whole wing,\nvector {d} contains the wing box beam transverse dis-\nplacement h and twist \u03c6; {AF (d, \u03b4TE, \u03b4LE)} is the vector\nof aerodynamic lifting force and pitching moment act-\ning on the wing, which depends on {d} especially the\ntwist angle, and the flexible TE and LE section deflec-\ntions \u03b4. For the highly flexible and large sweep angle\nSAW, a geometrically non-linear and large bending\u2013\ntorsion coupled deformation is expected. Equation (7)\nis expressed in the following form and solved in an\nProc. IMechE Vol. 223 Part G: J.

Effort is primarily focused\non achieving a maximum flutter speed by altering the\nfibre orientations of the skin and spar web laminates.\nSince the wing weight will not be altered, the analysis\ncan be expressed as follows\nMinimize fv(x) =\n[\n1 \u2212 Vf (x) \u2212 Vf (\u03b80)\nVf (\u03b80)\n]2\nx \u2208 [A(\u03b81, \u03b82, . . . , \u03b8n)], \u03b8n \u2208 [\u221290, 90] (9)\nwhere fv(x) is the objective function, Vf (x) is the wing\nflutter speed, x is a vector containing the fibre orienta-\ntions (\u03b81, \u03b82, . . . , \u03b8n) as design variables with lower and\nupper bounds of \u00b190\u25e6, \u03b80 represents a set of specified\nfibre orientations in the initial layup of the skin and\nspar webs.\n3.4 Control effectiveness\nThe flexibility of a wing adversely affects the effec-\ntiveness of the control surface. As expressed in\nequation (10) [26], a small increase in \tL is produced\nby a positive aileron (TE downward) rotation angle\n\u03b4TE and a positive (nose-up) wing twist angle \u03c6 due\nto elastic deformation of the wing\n\tL =\n(\n\u2202CL\n\u2202\u03b1\n\u03c6 + \u2202CL\n\u2202\u03b4TE\n\u03b4TE\n)\n1\n2\n\u03c1V 2S (10)\nFor a \u2018rigid\u2019 wing with the elastic twist ignored, the\nincrease of lift due to \u03be becomes\n\tLR = \u2202CL\n\u2202\u03b4TE\n\u03b4TE\n1\n2\n\u03c1V 2S (11)\nThe ratio of \tL to \tLR is defined as the aileron effec-\ntiveness to assess the control effectiveness of a flexible\nwing\nAileron effectiveness = \tL\n\tLR\n(12)\nTwo types of forces cause the wing elastic twist.\nOne is the aerodynamic torque induced by the lift\nand wing bending\u2013torsion coupling deformation. For\na sweep back wing, the induced twist angle is normally\nnegative (nose-down). Another is the aerodynamic\npitching moment M0 about the wing elastic centre\nassociated with the lift. It is normally positive for a gen-\neral case that the aerodynamic centre is forward of the\nelastic centre. Both the aerodynamic torque and pitch-\ning moment vary with the flight speed. When flight\nspeed increases, the wing elastic restoring moment\nmay not be sufficient enough against the negative twist\nof the wing because of the TE rotation downward.\nConsequently, the effective aileron incidence [26] and\naileron effectiveness and lift are reduced.When aileron\nreversal speed is reached, an aileron rotation produces\nzero rolling moment.\nFor the structural analysis and aeroelastic tailoring,\na set of in-house developed computer programs based\non the aforementioned analytical methods has been\nused. In addition, MSC PATRAN\/NASTRAN code was\nalso employed. Detail structural components such as\nstringers and ribs were also included in the SAW FE\nmodel. The FE stress and deflection results are used to\ncompare with the analytical results.\n4 EXAMPLES ANDRESULTS\n4.1 Wing loading condition\nA SAW planform as shown in Fig. 5 designed for a\nsmall UAV of maximum take-off mass 70 kg is taken\nas an example. The cruise speed is 40 m\/s and dive\nspeed 60 m\/s.The design ultimate load factors are+4.2\nand \u22121.5 g, respectively, which is mainly because of\nFig. 5 (a) Initial wing box 1 configuration and (b) a reduced swept angle wing box 2 configuration\nJAERO493 Proc.

This makes the wing structure experi-\nence the total shear force of 1015.89 N and maximum\nbending moment of 874.59 Nm at ultimate load 4.2 g.\nThis maximum load causes a concern in strength in the\ninitial design. In addition, the large sweep back angle\nof 40\u25e6 causes another concern in aeroelastic stability.\n4.2 SAW structure design and analysis\nThe SAW structure comprises a centre wing box and\nthe LE and TE sections. The centre wing box is made\nof the front and rear spars and skins reinforced by six\nT -shape stringers, three on the upper and three on the\nlower skin. Two structural configurations are consid-\nered in the current design. Figure 5(a) shows an initial\ndesign with the usual spar arrangement. Figure 5(b)\nshows an alternative configuration with the spars and\nstringers relocated to reduce the sweep angle of the\nwing box elastic axis. It was found that this alterna-\ntive design was better in terms of aeroelastic stability,\nespecially the control effectiveness with details pre-\nsented in section 4.5. This is because of the increased\nbending and torsion stiffness, but reduced coupling\nfor the same wing planform. The results presented in\nthe subsequent sections are for the improved wing box\n(wing box 2) configuration. Table 1 and Fig. 6 present\nthe dimensions of the two types of wing box. In the\nstructural model, the wing box was clamped at the root\nsection and was divided into eight spanwise single-cell\nbox beam segments.\n4.2.1 Initial design (Case 1)\nThe initial design was taken as a baseline exam-\nple, in which the wing skin and spars are made\nof 8-ply carbon\/epoxy laminate of symmetric layup\n[0\/45\/90\/\u221245]s with a skin thickness of 1 mm. The\nstringers have the same material and thickness as the\nskin. The material properties are listed in Table 2.\nBy applying the methods described in section 3,\nthe calculated maximum stress of 22.1 MPa indi-\ncates that initial design of the SAW structure is too\nconservative in terms of strength. The calculated\nflutter speed of 376 m\/s (>1.2VD) and control rever-\nsal speed of 150 m\/s (>VD) also satisfy the JAR-VLA\n(629-aeroelastic requirement).\n4.2.2 Reduced weight design (Case 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3)\nTo reduce the SAW structure weight, an alternative\ndesign was made. In this case, the material and\nlayup of the spars remain the same, but the skin and\nstringers are reduced to two layers of unidirectional\nE-glass\/epoxy. The change of material is mainly due to\nthe constraint on the number of carbon\/epoxy plies in\na symmetric layup. Because the composite was cured\nat elevated temperature, unsymmetrical layup will\ncause thermal distortion. Since the E-glass\/polyester\ncan be cured at room temperature, unsymmetrical\nlayup will not cause this problem. This gives flexibility\nin material thickness. Three different glass\/polyester\ninitial laminates were used, i.e. [0\/90] for case 2.1,\n[+45\/\u221245] for case 2.2, and [+20\/\u221220] for case 2.3 were\nconsidered. Material properties of the E-glass\/epoxy\nused in the analysis are listed in Table 2. In both cases,\nthe skin thickness was reduced to 0.5 mm and the wing\nbox structural weight was reduced by approximately\n30 per cent compared with the initial design.\nTo provide further details of the design, case 1 was\nalso modelled by using the NASTRAN code. The FE\nmodels were created to represent the SAW box struc-\nture first as shown in Fig. 7(a), and followed by the\nwhole SAW model including LE and TE section, as\nshown in Fig. 7(b). The TE section is integrated with\nTable 2 Mechanical properties of carbon\/epoxy and E-glass\/epoxy\nMaterial E1 (GPa) E2 (GPa) G12 (GPa) v12 Xt (MPa) Xc (MPa) Yt (MPa) Yc (MPa) S (MPa) \u03c1 (Kg\/m3)\nCarbon\/epoxy 135 9.5 4.9 0.3 1680 1100 61 244 90 1600\nE-glass\/epoxy 40 8.0 4.0 0.25 1000 600 30 110 40 1900\nProc.

The connection of the discs to the skin stiff-\neners were modelled using RBE2 elements in the FE\nmodels. The whole wing model was further analysed\nwith a closed and open TE where the proposed actua-\ntion mechanism is integrated. Table 3 summarizes the\nmaximum transverse deflections at the wing tip under\nthe maximum load factor of 4.2 g for these cases.\n4.3 Laminate stress analysis\nFirst the thin-walled box method and laminate theory\nwere used to calculate the average stress through the\nlaminate thickness and then the stress and FI of each\nply. In the approximate method, the maximum normal\nstress is expected to occur on the skins close to the\nfront spar and shear stress in the spar web, respectively.\nThe ultimate load factor of 4.2 g was applied.\nFor the initial design case 1 (carbon\/epoxy mate-\nrial), the maximum average normal stress 22.1 MPa of\nthe lower skin and shear stress 3.72 MPa in the web\nwas converted to a local force intensity of 22.1 kN\/m\nand shear force intensity 3.72 kN\/m. Those forces were\nused for further detailed stress calculation in each lam-\ninate ply and the FI based on the classic laminate\ntheory. The resulting maximum Hoffman FI of 0.06 in\nthe 90\u25e6 ply indicates that the initial design case 1 is too\nconservative and obviously over designed in terms of\nstrength.\nFor the design cases 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 (glass\/epoxy\nskins), the maximum normal and shear stresses\nlocated in the same region of the skin laminate at\nthe root section as case 1 are 35.26 and 7.58 MPa,\nrespectively. The resulting maximum Hoffman FI of\n0.02 in the skin laminate indicates that the wing box\ndesign still has plenty of strength reserves and shows\nthe potential for design optimization and further\nstructural weight reduction.\nFE analysis using NASTRAN was carried out for more\naccurate and detailed stress analysis of the SAW. These\nresults are listed in Table 4 together with the results\nobtained from the analytical method presented in\nsection 3. The comparison indicates that the FE and\nanalytical stress results in the specified region agree\nvery well. However, two major differences are noted\nin the comparison. First, although the FE stress is\ndistributed and more detailed, the comparison with\nanalytical result can only be made in the same region\nand ply rather than point to point. Second, the FE\nmodel also considered the structural coupling effect\n(sweep angle) and the stress concentration effect.\nTherefore the stress on the skin near the rear spar\nTable 4 Maximum direct and shear stresses for study cases 1\u20132\nCase 1 Case 2.1\u20132.3 Case 1.1 Case 1.2 Case 1.3\nDesign case (analytical) (analytical) (FEM) (FEM) (FEM)\nDirect stress (MPa) \u00b122.1 35.3 19.4\/\u221220.1 25 24\nShear stress (MPa) 3.73 7.60 1.72 2.31 1.88\nHoffman failure index 0.06 0.02 0.04 0.07 0.02\nJAERO493 Proc.

The results indicate that a maximum stress\nof 5.8 MPa occurs around the connection of the curved\nbeam to the rear spar.\nSince the SAW design case 2 is still very conservative\nin terms of strength, attention was subsequently paid\nto the stiffness and aeroelastic stability.\n4.4 Aeroelastic tailoring\nAeroelastic tailoring has been carried out by optimiz-\ning the SAW skin laminate layup to find an optimal\ncombined bending and torsion stiffness for aeroelas-\ntic stability without increasing the weight and violating\nthe strength criterion. Only the lightweight design\ncase 2.1 ([0\/90] skin), 2.2 ([\u00b145] skin), and 2.3 ([\u00b120]\nskin) were considered. In the model, each section\nof the eight spanwise segments of the wing model\nwas divided into four laminate panels representing\nthe upper and lower skins, and front and rear spar\nwebs along the thin-walled box cross-section circum-\nference. It results in 32 pieces of laminate panels and\n160 plies in the model. If the ply fibre orientations\nwere taken as an independent design variable, then\nthere would be 160 design variables in the optimiza-\ntion process. However, the design variables can be\nreduced under specified conditions. These analyses\nare reported below.\n4.4.1 Case 2.1 [0\/90]\nEight ply orientations were taken as design variables\nincluding two in the upper skin, two in lower skin,\nand two in each of the spar web panels at the root\nsection. The laminates in the rest of the seven span-\nwise sections were kept the same as the optimized root\nsection during the optimization. This condition keeps\nthe laminate layup uniform along the spanwise wing\nbox for easy manufacture. When the laminates were\noptimized, the flutter speed Vf was increased from\nits original 123 m\/s up to 169.7 m\/s (Table 5). Sum-\nmary of the optimized laminate layups at root section\nand the flutter results are given in Table 5. A compari-\nson between the initial and optimized rigidities of the\nsection along the SAW span is shown in Fig. 8. The tip\nsection is marked as point 1 and the root section is\nmarked as point 8.\n4.4.2 Case 2.2 [\u00b145]\nSimilar to the previous case, the eight plies (two for\neach of the four laminate panels) at the root section\nwere taken as design variables. The layups of the\neight spanwise sections were kept uniform in the opti-\nmization. The flutter speed of the initial skin layup\n[+45\/\u221245] is 318 m\/s. Following the optimization, a\nslightly higher value of 321 m\/s was achieved. Details\nof the initial and optimized design results are shown\nin Table 5. A comparison of the initial and optimized\nrigidities of the wing box along the span is shown in\nFig. 8.\n4.4.3 Case 2.3 [\u00b120]\nStarted from this particular initial layup, the optimiza-\ntion was carried out with the same design variables\nsimilar to the previous cases. The laminates in the\nrest of the seven spanwise sections were kept uniform\nas the optimized root section during the optimiza-\ntion. The flutter speed for the optimized layup was\nincreased from 162 to 189 m\/s.

It is also noted that the\naeroelastic tailoring is much more effective by opti-\nmizing the skin and web layups around the wing box\nsection circumference rather than along the spanwise\nsection.\n4.5 Control effectiveness\nThe control effectiveness of the whole wing takes into\naccount the swept angle and elastic twist effect. The\ncontrol effectiveness results over a flight speed range\nfor case 1 and optimized cases 2 are obtained by\nusing equations (10) to (12). Control reversal speed\nVR of design case 1 was 145 m\/s. Figure 9 shows that\nthe reversal speeds have been increased as a result\nof the aeroelastic tailoring. However, for the opti-\nmized design case 2.1 [0\/90] VR is significantly low at\n75 m\/s. For optimized case 2.2 [+45\/\u221245],VR is further\nreduced to 70 m\/s. The reversal speed for optimized\ncase 2.3 [+20\/\u221220] remains higher compared to cases\n2.1 and 2.2 at 85 m\/s.\nFor all three cases 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3, the lower VR\nis mainly due to the lower GJ compared to case 1.\nAlthough case 2.2 has a greater GJ compared to case\n2.1, the VR is even lower. This is mainly due to lower EI\nin case 2.2 and the strong bending\u2013torsion coupling\nof the flexible wing box. The reduced EI induced a\nnose down twist and resulted in a lower VR. There-\nfore an optimal layup with both greater EI and GJ\nshould be a better solution. Since the optimized case\n2.3 met this requirement, the resulting VR = 85 m\/s\nwas indeed higher than the other two cases. Despite\nthe Vf = 189 m\/s of this solution being lower than case\n2.2, it is higher compared to the first option of case\n2.1 and gives adequate safety margin for aeroelastic\nstability.\nJAERO493 Proc.

Mechanically the design provides a\nsimple and feasible actuation solution. Structurally it\noffers a lightweight solution. Because of the relatively\nlow stress level at the 4.2 g ultimate load factor, the\nstructural strength has enough safety margin for even\ntwo layers of glass\/epoxy skin laminate. However, the\nreduced wing box stiffness leads to a significant reduc-\ntion of aeroelastic stability in terms of flutter speed and\ncontrol reversal speed. This is solved by performing\nan aeroelastic tailoring with optimum solutions. It is\nfound that both the flutter and control reversal speeds\nare dominated by the torsion stiffness. It is also noted\nthat the large sweep angle has negative aeroelastic\neffect on both flutter speed and control effectiveness\nbecause of the large negative bending\u2013torsion cou-\npling. Therefore the bending stiffness of the SAW of\nthis particular wing planform also plays a significant\nrole in the control effectiveness and has been taken\ninto consideration in the optimization process.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThe authors acknowledge the financial support from\nthe UK EPSRC, BAE Systems, and MBDA and the tech-\nnical advices received from the industrial advisors\nProf. C.
