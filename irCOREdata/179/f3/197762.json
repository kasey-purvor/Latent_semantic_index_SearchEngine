Undergraduates from a large university in Northern Ireland \nparticipated in the study. It was found that men, when forced to decide, were more \nupset by sexual infidelity and women by emotional. It was also found that men were \nmore likely to believe that women have sex when in love and that women believe that \nmen have sex even when they are not in love. It was not, however, found that either \nmen or women believed that having cybersex implied the other was also in love or \nthat being in love online implied they were having cybersex. These results are \nexplained through a social cognitive lens.  \n \n \nEmotional and sexual infidelity 3 \nEmotional and Sexual infidelity Offline and in Cyberspace \n \nMany researchers have come to the conclusion that there are two main types \nof infidelity: sexual and emotional (e.g., Buss, Larsen, Westen, & Semmelroth, 1992; \nShackelford & Buss, 1996). Sexual infidelity is considered to be engaging in sexual \nintercourse with someone other than one\u2019s partner. Emotional infidelity is understood \nto be falling in love with another individual other than one\u2019s partner. This article \nexamines two dimensions of infidelity both offline and online. \nBefore moving on to consider these two forms of infidelity, we do note that \nnot everyone is in agreement that sexual and emotional infidelity are the only forms of \nrelationship transgressions.. Roscoe, Cavanaugh, and Kennedy (1988), for instance, \nfound that undergraduates believed that in addition to sexual intercourse that \nbehaviors, such as dating or spending time with a different partner and engaging in \nother sexual interactions with someone else, such as kissing, flirting, and petting are \nalso acts of infidelity. Yarab, Sensibaugh, and Allgerier (1998) have claimed that \nother unfaithful behaviors include, passionately kissing, sexual fantasies, non-sexual \nfantasies about falling in love, sexual attraction, romantic attraction, flirting and \nbehavior in dyads, such as, studying, having lunch with, and going to a movie with \nsomeone other than one\u2019s partner. We also take the line that there are other unfaithful \nbehaviors besides sex and falling in love, however, this paper is solely focusing on \nsexual and emotional infidelity. \n \nTheoretical Explanations for Gender Differences \nTheorists have also considered how upsetting these two forms of infidelities \nare for men and women. Overall, it seems that men and women do not differ in the \nEmotional and sexual infidelity 4 \namount or how regularly they experience jealousy (Buss, 2000). Nonetheless, it has \nbeen found that men and women differ in the \u201cweighting given to the cues that trigger \njealousy\u201d (Buss, 2000, p. 46). The research finds that men are more upset by sexual \ninfidelity and women by emotional infidelity. Different theoretical explanations have \nbeen offered to explain these gender differences. \nSome theorists have explained these gender differences through an \nevolutionary lens. According to such an approach, through natural selection the \nhuman species has inherited certain traits and emotional reactions. Researchers, such \nas Buss (2000), contend that ancestral man faced a grave threat from cuckoldry \u2013 that \nbeing uncertainty about their paternity of their partner\u2019s children. Consequently, men \nare more likely to respond with more intense jealousy to sexual infidelity than women \nare. Ancestral woman, on the other hand, faced the risk that an unfaithful male partner \nmight divert his resources to another woman and her children. Therefore women have \ndeveloped an innate jealousy towards emotional infidelity (the assumption being that \nthe man will expend resources on the \u2018other woman\u2019 that they are in love with). There \nis empirical evidence to support such a theory. For example, Roscoe et al. (1988) \nasked their participants to list what behaviors they believed constituted being \nunfaithful to a dating partner who is involved in a serious dating relationship. They \nfound that men were more likely to state that a sexual encounter with a different \npartner was an exemplar of infidelity. In contrast, women were more likely to state \nthat spending time with another and keeping secrets from a partner were acts of \ninfidelity. Shackelford and Buss (1996) have found that women more than men rate \nextra dyadic emotional behavior as more upsetting than extra dyadic sexual behavior. \nHowever, it is also noteworthy that both men and women report extra dyadic sexual \nEmotional and sexual infidelity 5 \nbehavior to be more unacceptable and a greater betrayal than extra dyadic emotional \nbehavior (Shackelford & Buss 1996).  \nNot all theorists agree with evolutionary theorists\u2019 arguments. For example, \nDeSteno, Bartlett, Braverman, and Salovey (2002) have argued that the methodology \nBuss and his colleagues use to test out their claims is not sound. They emphatically \nargue that \u201cthe choice between sexual and emotional infidelity reflects a false \ndichotomy\u201d (p. 1104). Alternative theories have been developed to explain jealousy \nand upset experienced from betrayal. For instance, some theorists have contended that \njealousy might be better explained by a social-cognitive approach, as well as \ndevelopmental theory (e.g., DeSteno & Salovey, 1996; Harris, 2004; Harris & \nChristenfeld, 1996). Such theorists believe it is crucial to understand what men and \nwomen read into their spouses\u2019 infidelity. This has been named the \u201cdouble-shot \nhypothesis\u201d (DeSteno & Salovey, 1996) or the \u201ctwo-for-one hypothesis\u201d (Harris & \nChristenfeld, 1996), which essentially argues that: \n \nMen tend to think sexual infidelity would be more distressing because they infer \nthat if a woman has sex with another man, she is probably also in love with him. \nWomen tend to believe that men can have sex without being in love. Hence, \nsexual infidelity does not necessarily imply emotional infidelity. (Harris, 2004; \np.65) \n \nTo test out their claims Harris and Christenfeld (1996) asked their participants \nto think of a serious romantic relationship they had been involved in and to imagine \nthat this partner has been engaging in sexual intercourse with someone else. On a 5-\npoint likert scale participants had to rate the likelihood that their partner was in love \nEmotional and sexual infidelity 6 \nwith the person they had sex with. In addition they were again asked to think of a \nserious romantic relationship they had been involved in and to imagine that their \npartner was in love with someone else. On a 5-point likert scale participants had to \nrate the likelihood that their partner was having sex with the person they were in love \nwith. As predicted they found that men were more likely to say that their partner was \nin love with the person they were having sexual intercourse with and women were \nmore likely to say that their partner was having sex with the person they had fallen in \nlove with. \n \nInternet Infidelity \n This current study was especially interested in examining gender differences \nin how men and women understand sexual and emotional betrayals in cyberspace. \nWhile it has been recently accepted that certain acts online are construed as real acts \nof infidelity (e.g., Aviram & Amichai-Hamburger, 2005; Mileham, 2007; Parker & \nWampler 2003; Whitty, 2003, 2005; Whitty & Carr, 2005, 2006) little is still known \nabout these forms of betrayal. When Whitty (2003) asked her participants to rate \nwhether they believed certain online behaviours were potential acts of infidelity she \nfound that cybersex was rated very highly and almost as severe as sexual intercourse. \nIn a follow-up study, instead of asking participants directly about what they believed \nwere acts of internet betrayal, Whitty (2005) employed a qualitative method to \ninvestigate people\u2019s representations of internet infidelity. In this study it was found \nthat emotional infidelity was stressed as much as sexual infidelity. Importantly, \nWhitty (2005) also examined the kind of impact participants believed that cyber-\ncheating could have on the offline relationship. Sixty-five percent of the stories \nmentioned that the aggrieved had been hurt or upset by this virtual encounter. \nEmotional and sexual infidelity 7 \nMoreover, in many cases participants wrote that the online infidelity led to a break up \nof the relationship. She concluded from this study that some online interactions could \npotentially have serious repercussions on the offline relationship. \n Gender differences have also been identified when it comes to attitudes \ntowards cyber-infidelities. Whitty (2005) found that women, more than men, \nmentioned emotional betrayal in their stories of cyber-infidelities. In line with \nprevious research on offline infidelity (e.g., Amato & Previti 2003; Paul & Galloway \n1994), she also found that women were more likely than men to write that they would \nend the relationship if they found out their partner was having an internet affair.  \nMoreover, the women in Whitty\u2019s (2005) study were more likely than the men to talk \nabout the time and distancing from the relationship the infidelity caused. Parker and \nWampler\u2019s (2003) study, which considered sexual online activities, found that women \nviewed these activities more seriously than men did. \n \nCurrent Study \nIn this study we firstly set out to see if the results obtained by Buss et al. \n(1992) and Harris and Christenfeld (1996) could be replicated with a Northern Irish \nsample. In line with these theorists, then, we hypothesized that when given a forced \nchoice that men will more likely rate sexual infidelity as more upsetting and women \nwould rate emotional infidelity as more upsetting. In addition, based on Harris and \nChristenfeld\u2019s (1996) work we hypothesized that men are more likely to think that \nwomen have sex only when in love and that women are more likely to think that men \nhave sex without love. Furthermore, we hypothesized that women are more likely to \nthink if their partner is in love with another person they will have sex with them, and \nthat women are more likely to think that men in love are certainly have sex. \nEmotional and sexual infidelity 8 \nThe second aim of this study was to examine how men and women understand \nonline sexual and emotional infidelity. We wanted to firstly determine, when \ncompared to offline infidelities and forced to choose, whether individuals would \nselect cyber-infidelities as more upsetting. Based on previous findings we \nhypothesized that when forced to decide offline infidelities would be perceived as \nmore upsetting than online. In addition, we wanted to examine whether Harris and \nChristenfeld\u2019s theory applies to online infidelities. Although cybersex is obviously \nquite a different act to sexual intercourse they share many aspects in common (e.g., \nsexual pleasure in the company of another person \u2013 even if it is not the same physical \nspace). Moreover, previous research has found that cybersex is perceived as almost a \nsevere an act of infidelity as sexual intercourse and that viewing pornography online \nis understood to be very different (Whitty, 2003). Therefore, we hypothesized that \nmen are more likely to think that women have cybersex only when in love and that \nwomen are more likely to think that men have cybersex without love. Furthermore, \nwe hypothesized that women are more likely to think if their partner is in love with \nanother person they will have cybersex with them, and that women are more likely to \nthink that men in love are certainly have cybersex. Although individuals\u2019 online and \noffline worlds often collide (Whitty & Carr, 2006), in this study the online infidelity \nscenarios were restricted to the cyberworld. \n \nMethod \nMaterials \nA survey was constructed for this study. Participants were initially asked to \nprovide information on their gender, age, and sexual orientation. Next questions based \non Buss et al.\u2019s (1992) and Harris and Christenfeld\u2019s (1996) work were drawn from \nEmotional and sexual infidelity 9 \nand added to so that sexual and emotional internet infidelity could also be considered. \nFirst, drawing from Buss et al. (1992) participants were asked: \n \n1) Please think of a serious romantic relationship you have had in the past, \ncurrently have or would like to have. Imagine that you discover that your partner has \nbecome interested in someone else.

Imagine that you discover that your partner is in \nlove with someone else that they have met online, and have never met face-to-face. \nHow likely do you think it is that your partner is also engaging in cybersex with this \nother person? \n \nProcedure \n After obtaining the approval of an ethics committee, psychology students \nenrolled in a large university in Northern Ireland were invited to participate in the \nstudy. Participants initially were provided with a consent form and an information \nsheet describing the study and the kind of questions they would be asked. They were \nassured of anonymity and were informed that they could withdraw consent without \npenalty. Those who then wished to participate filled out the survey, which took \napproximately five minutes to complete. Participants were given an email and phone \nnumber to contact if they had any further queries about the study. They were also \ngiven the telephone number and an email address of the student counseling service \nEmotional and sexual infidelity 11 \n(which is a free service to students) in case they experienced any distress from \ncompleting the survey (although we expected they would not). \n \nParticipants \n The participants were 112 psychology undergraduate students, comprising of \n61 (55%) women and 51 (45%) men. Participants ranged between 18 and 44 years of \nage (M=23.72, SD=6.38). All of the participants were heterosexual. \n \nResults \nFor the first question, not a single participant responded that b) engaging in \ncybersex or d) falling in love online would upset them more. Consequently, we \ncompared whether men and women significantly differed in their responses to a) \nsexual intercourse and c) falling in love offline. As hypothesized, and shown in Table \n1, we found that more men than women believed that sexual infidelity was more \nupsetting, and more women than men were upset by emotional infidelity, \u03c72(1, \nN=112) = 41.85, p < .001. \nTable 1 \nComparison of men\u2019s and women\u2019s distress in response to imagining offline \nemotional and sexual infidelity (in percentages) \n \n  More bothered by \nGender N Sex Love \nWomen 61 23 77 \nMen 51 84 16 \n \nEmotional and sexual infidelity 12 \n \n To analyze whether men and women differ in the extent to which they think \none form of infidelity implies another we subjected questions 2-5 (described in the \nmethod section) to one-way ANOVAs (means and standard deviations are displayed \nin Table 2). Applying an \u03b1-level of 0.05, there was a statistically significant gender \ndifference for sex implies love, F(1, 110) = 5.44, p = .021 (\u03b72 = .05), however, there \nwere no significant differences for any of the other scenarios. \n \nTable 2 \n \nMeans and standard deviations of participants ratings of how much sexual infidelity \n(on and offline) implies emotional infidelity and how much emotional infidelity (on \nand offline) implies sexual infidelity \n \nGender N Sex implies love Love implies \nsex \nCybersex \nimplies love \nOnline love \nimplies cybersex \nWomen 61 3.16 \n(1.25) \n3.51 \n(1.09) \n2.74 \n(1.15) \n3.03 \n(1.10) \nMen 51 3.71 \n(1.19) \n3.67 \n(1.11) \n2.71 \n(1.36) \n2.76 \n(1.21) \nTotal 112 3.41 \n(1.25) \n3.58 \n(1.10) \n2.72 \n(1.25) \n2.91 \n(1.15) \n \n \nEmotional and sexual infidelity 13 \n Given that the means for the cyber-infidelities looked much lower than the \nmeans for the offline infidelities we decided to conduct paired t-tests to determine if \nthere were any statistical significant differences between these. We found that the \nmeans for \u2018sex implies love\u2019 were significantly higher than \u2018cybersex implies love\u2019, \nt(111) = 4.29, p < .001 (\u03b72 = 0.14). We also found that the means for \u2018love implies \nsex\u2019 were significantly higher than \u2018online love implies cybersex\u2019, t(111) = 4.83, p < \n.001 (\u03b72 = 0.17) \n \nDiscussion \n \nThe results yielded in this study only partly replicated previous studies and \nonly partly supported our hypotheses. In addition, they provide new insights into how \nmen and women perceive internet infidelities. \n In considering our first hypotheses we found, in line with previous \nresearchers, that when given the choice men thought sexual infidelity was more \nupsetting and women thought emotional infidelity was more upsetting. What was \nperhaps more interesting was that not one participant considered that cybersex or \nfalling in love online was the most upsetting scenario. Previous research has found \nthat when presented with hypothetical scenarios of internet infidelity that, although \nmany perceived these as relationship transgressions, not everyone is convinced that \nthis is real infidelity (Whitty, 2005; Whitty & Carr, 2005, 2006). Whitty and her \ncolleague (Whitty, 2005; Whitty & Carr, 2005, 2006) have argued that given the \nnewness of the internet that the rules have still not been clearly defined as to what are \nacceptable online encounters. Moreover, it has been argued that, given that \ncyberspace is regularly perceived as a space that is part fantasy and part reality, online \nEmotional and sexual infidelity 14 \nsexual encounters and online relationships may not be perceived as threatening or \nhurtful to an offline relationship when compared to offline relationship transgressions \n(Whitty, 2005, Whitty & Carr, 2005, 2006). The results obtained in this study suggest \nthat such theorists might be correct in their claims. \n As mentioned earlier in this paper, theorists have taken different theoretical \nstances in their attempts to explain why men and women differ in their perceptions \nand emotional reactions towards infidelity. Evolutionary theorists contend that men \nand women have evolved to become more upset by specific types of infidelity. They \nbelieve that because of concerns with paternity men are more likely to be upset by \nsexual infidelity, and in contrast, because of upset in regard to losing a man\u2019s \nresources women are more upset by emotional infidelity. The second part of this \nassumption is difficult to argue in current times where, at least in Western countries, \nmost women no longer require a man\u2019s resources in order to support herself and her \nchildren. Nonetheless, the results obtained in this study are consistent with what \nevolutionary theorists would predict. However, given that, like previous theorists, we \nwere not convinced that an evolutionary approach is the best way to explain these \ngender differences we sought to replicate Harris and Christenfeld\u2019s (1996) work \nwhich challenges these findings. \n In contrast to the evolutionary view, theorists have drawn upon a social-\ncognitive model to explain gender differences in upset caused by sexual and \nemotional infidelity (DeSteno & Salovey 1996; Harris & Christenfeld, 1996;). Such \ntheorists posit that men and women are upset by different types of infidelities because \nof what they call the double-shot hypothesis or the two-for-one hypothesis. This \ncurrent study, however, did not fully support this view. We found support for the first \npart of this theory, that men assume that women typically only have sex when in love \nEmotional and sexual infidelity 15 \nand that women do not assume that a man needs to be in love for him to have sex. \nThis would explain why men rated sexual infidelity as more upsetting than women do \ngiven that they do receive the double-shot of sexual and emotional infidelity when \nthey think about their female partner cheating on them. However, we did not find \nsupport for the second part of the hypothesis, that is, that women are more likely to \nbelieve than men that if their partner is in love with someone else they are likely to be \nhaving sex with them. \nSo why might our results differ to what Harris and Christenfeld (1996) found \nin their research? What appears to be happening here is that the men in this current \nsample are more likely than Harris and Christenfeld\u2019s (1996) sample to believe that \ntheir female partner would engage in sex with another man if she is in love with him. \nHarris and Christenfeld\u2019s (1996) collected in the mid 90s \u2013 a time when some \nsociologists claim that people were more sexually conservative as a consequence of \nchanging sexual practices due to fear of catching HIV (Scott, 1998). Times have \nchanged, and so too have sexual practices and attitudes towards sexual practices. This \nstudy provides some evidence towards this shift in thinking about sexual practices. \nHowever, we argue here that although we have not completely replicated Harris and \nChristenfeld\u2019s study, our results nonetheless support a social-cognitive model as they \ndemonstrate that social shifts lead men and women to think differently about sex and \nlove.  \nThis study also considered whether the double-shot hypothesis or the two-for-\none hypothesis applied to attitudes towards cyber-infidelities. We did not obtain \nsignificant gender differences on either of the items that tested these hypotheses. \nMoreover, we found that participants were much less likely to believe that cybersex \nimplied love or that online love implied cybersex than they were to believe that sexual \nEmotional and sexual infidelity 16 \nintercourse implied love or that love implied sexual intercourse. This could be for a \nnumber of reasons. First, given that previous research has found that most people \nhave not engaged in online sexual activities (e.g., Whitty, 2003) then making \nconnections between love and cybersex are not so easy to do. As previously argued, \ndefining betrayal lies in \u2018relationship knowledge structures\u2019 (Whitty & Carr 2005). \nSecond, given that cybersex is qualitatively different to sexual intercourse then, \nalthough individuals might still perceive it as a relationship transgression, they do not \nnecessarily link it with love in the same way they would with offline relationship \ntransgressions. Whereas this result does not help provide support for the double-shot \nand two-for-one hypotheses they equally did not provide support for the evolutionary \nargument. Further research needs to consider whether men and women, when forced \nto decide, are upset more by cybersex or falling in love online. Moreover, it needs to \nconsider why men and women might perceive certain acts online to be acts of \nbetrayal. \nAlthough this study has advanced our understandings of how individuals \nunderstand offline and online infidelity there are some obvious limitations. Like \nprevious studies it is limited to considerations of hypothetical scenarios of infidelity. \nAlso future research needs to examine whether we would find the same results for an \nolder population and with individuals who are not university students. Future research \nshould also examine why cybersex and online love are not strongly linked to one \nanother. \nIn concluding, this study contributes to the debate of whether upset caused by \nrelationship transgressions can be best explained by evolutionary or social cognitive \nmodels. Moreover, it provides more information about how men and women \nEmotional and sexual infidelity 17 \nunderstand offline and online infidelities. Finally, it highlights that more research is \nrequired in this field. \n \n \nEmotional and sexual infidelity 18 \nReferences \nAmato, P. R., & Previti, D. (2003).
