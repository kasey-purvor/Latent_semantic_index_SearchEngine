At\nthe same time public funding of universities has decreased. Furthermore, the current pace\nof technological innovation and change and the fact that there are fewer jobs for life with\nclear pathways for progression mean that more of us need to be engaged in learning\nthroughout our lives in order to remain competitive in the job-market. That is the reality of\nlifelong learning. Students are consequently demanding (especially as they are having to\nmeet more of the costs of education themselves) a more flexible learning framework. This\nframework should be able to accommodate all types of learners - part-time, mature,\nremote and disabled students. The revised Disability Discrimination Act, which came into\nforce in October 1999, only temporarily excludes education from its remit and has already\nchallenged university practices. (Another JlSC-funded initiative, Disability Information\nSystems in Higher Education, addresses just this issue: http:\/\/www.disinhe.ac.uk.) All this\nis set against a backdrop of the government's stated vision for a more inclusive, less elitist\neducation system with opportunities for all, and the requirement for a professional and\naccountable community of university teachers.\nResponses to these challenges have in part focused on modifications to course design, such\nas modularization with smaller and discrete units allowing for credit accumulation and\ntransfer within and between institutions, including collaboration between further and\nhigher education institutions. There has also been an increased emphasis on collaborative\nwork amongst students, at least partially as a way of reducing teacher contact hours.\nFinally, and most relevant to our own project, the introduction of communication and\ninformation technology (C&IT) has also been identified as a strategy for meeting these\nchallenges.\nA variety of uses of C&IT have been proposed and developed, but one increasingly\nimportant strand of innovation is the use of conferencing technologies which have the\npotential to enhance dialogue amongst those engaged in learning. Video-conferencing (one-\nto-one, one-to-many, many-to-many); text-based communication (email, bulletin boards,\nconferencing,) and audio-conferencing (telephone tutoring, shared workspace plus audio\nlink) are the principal technologies that have emerged to organize these mediated forms of\nlearning conversation. These are the technologies that are the focus of our own research.\nImplications for staff development and training\nSuch conferencing technologies are not new, but they are relatively new to the further and\nhigher education sectors as tools for teaching and learning. Currently, they could not be\ndescribed as mainstream or commonplace although there is increasing pressure for them to\nbe assimilated into the learning arena. Clearly it is unrealistic (or at the very least unwise)\nto expect that conferencing technologies can be introduced without adequate support. The\nintroduction and integration of conferencing technologies has many implications for staff\ndevelopment and training. A central issue in the deployment of such resources to support\neffective learning is the development, or adaptation of communication skills for the virtual\nlearning environment. It is not always a case of adapting teaching methods to new\ntechnologies, but, rather, of developing new methods through their use. Learning tasks or\n72\nALT-J Volume 8 Number I\nstudent-teacher roles initially complying to more traditional models may be revised by\nteachers reflecting upon experience with, for example, asynchronous text-based\nconferencing. Nation and Walker (1993) conceive of staff development and training as a\nproblem of 'converting people who have been reared as learners and teachers in classroom\ncontexts to different forms of practice'.\nThe aims of our research project are therefore to identify effective communicative practices\nfor different conferencing technologies and feed back information about such practices to\nthe educational community. Teachers working in further and higher education institutions\nand support staff responsible for developing practice are our main target audience. It is\nalso our hope that our product (a final report and staff development resource rolled into\none) will be of use and of interest to network support and C&IT development groups,\neducation and\/or communication researchers as well as policy-makers within higher and\nfurther education. Information and support from and to all levels is desirable and\nnecessary if sustainable change is to be achieved.\nTheoretical framework\nChanging the tools of learning by introducing conferencing technologies generally requires\nchanges and adaptations in human behaviour for successful communication to take place.\nThere has long been the appreciation that when communication shifts to a different medium\nthere is a loss of some of the audio and\/or visual information that would be available in face-\nto-face encounters. In one of the first systematic attempts to deal with this issue, Rutter,\nStephenson and Dewley (1981) argued that the loss of such information results in\n'cuelessness', i.e. people feel uncertain about where and when in a conversation they can\ninterject and as a consequence retreat from more spontaneous interaction, focusing to a\ngreater degree on the basic message at the expense of developing a broader shared\nunderstanding. People find ways to compensate for these limitations, however, and discover\nways of reinstating information that would be available face-to-face. An obvious example of\nthis is the' use of 'emoticons' to signal attitudinal or emotional information in an email\nmessage. Other recent research, carried out in real-life settings, supports our basic contention\nthat people do learn to adapt to new technologies and, moreover, adapt their uses of these\nbetter to meet their teaching or learning purpose (CoSHEP, 1998; Isaacs and Tang, 1997;\nO'Connail and Whittaker, 1997; Sellen, 1997; Yates, 1997, Whittaker and O'Connail, 1997).\nThis is not to argue, however, that developing good communication skills for conferencing\nis simply a matter of developing strategies for compensation. Conferencing technologies\nalso have their 'affordances', a term first applied to the use of electronic media by Gaver\n(1992). Affordances are properties of an object or system which enable certain actions or\nfunctions to be performed more readily than others (Gibson, 1966). The affordances of\nconferencing technologies remediate and reshape the teaching and learning environment.\nWhilst it can be argued that the technology interposes between direct person to person\ninteraction, it may actually create a shared environment that shapes the process of\ninterpersonal communications (Dede, 1991).\nIt is our starting position that the limitations and affordances of conferencing technologies\nrequire adaptations and changes in human behaviour for successful communication to take\nplace. Adaptations and the development of new skills and strategies generally happen over\n73\nKerry Musselbrook et at Learning networks and communication skills\na period of time. They also happen in response to, and in service of, a specific task, that is,\nan identified need (Leont'ev, 1981; 1978; Engstrom, 1987; Lewis, 1997).\nAccepting this approach, the means of communication should not be treated as something\nseparate in communicators' minds from the content in which the communication takes\nplace or indeed the context (Cole, 1996). Teaching and learning does not happen in a\nvacuum; we contend that every teaching and learning domain has its own unique\nconfiguration which needs to be acknowledged. This might encompass the capabilities\/\nfunctionality of the technology in question, the persons using it to communicate, cultural\nand environmental factors, and the nature and content of the message(s) relayed. The aims\nand objectives of every course and the tasks it includes are also unique. Clearly the success\nof any communication and the measure of 'good' educational practice is contingent upon\nand defined by the aims and objectives as they are perceived.\nExisting approaches often assume that adaptation to new technologies is simply a matter\nof defining and acquiring a generic set of skills. The research team refutes the notion,\nhowever, that a generic set of skills can be identified or acquired to meet the needs of all\nusers of conferencing technologies in a range of teaching and learning environments.\nInstead, it is our contention that adapting to or learning how to use conferencing\ntechnologies effectively is activity-based, context-specific and situated - as, one would\nargue, is all effective teaching and learning.\nMethodological design, data collection, analysis and dissemination\nThe framework outlined above informed the design of our research and the methodology\nadopted. If adaptations to technology are situated in the domain and purpose of its\neveryday use, there is no point looking for them in artificial or laboratory settings (or\nfeeding back this information in an abstract, context-free mode). We therefore opted to\nexamine and present findings from real cases, drawn from a range of teaching and learning\nsites with two or more years' experience of incorporating conferencing technologies into\ntheir teaching.\nThe teaching sites\nIt is our hope that the range of cases will increase the likelihood of teachers in the further\nand higher education community recognizing circumstances and issues that are similar to\ntheir own. A breakdown of the courses offered by sites participating in this study is given\nin Table 1. The courses listed in Table 1 were based at a variety of institutions including\ntraditional and post-1992 universities, the Open University and a number of the colleges\nwhich form part of the new University of the Highlands and Islands.\nA variety of subject disciplines, undergraduate and postgraduate courses are represented,\nwhere conferencing technologies are an 'interesting add on', or are one of several teaching\nand learning components, or are essential to the actual functioning of the course.\nConferencing technologies might be essential if they provide the only means for interaction\nand discussion as part of a distance education course, or they enable the grouping of a\nsufficient number of students to make a course or module viable and cost-effective to run.\nIn some cases conferencing technologies have been the focus of students' studies as well as\nthe means of delivery or a channel for communicating.

The\ncritical issue is the extent to which users of the technology (teachers and students)\nunderstand what the activity is for, and what their objectives are. It was therefore essential\nto take a phenomenographic approach (Marton, 1981; 1982; 1994) and interview staff and\nstudents about perceived objectives, and hear their stories about the success or failure of\ndifferent communicative strategies - which may or may not have been consciously adopted.\nPotential disharmony between students' and teachers' models of learning and their views\non learning aims and objectives are unlikely to be captured in any other way, as are possible\nmismatches between sender and recipient on the meaning of communicative content.\nFurthermore, much communication takes place offline as well as on and may not be\ncaptured for posterity on audio or video tape, or as an archive of a text-based conference.\nContent analysis of a text can help describe it but it cannot always or accurately reveal the\nimpact of one message in relation to another. Observing the conferencing technologies in\nuse and gaining access to archive data - tapes of telephone conferences, video conferences,\nand archives of text-based conferences - did provide useful insights, however. They allowed\n75\nKerry Musselbrook et al Learning networks and communication skills\nmembers of the research group to become familiar with the learning environments\nconcerned and helped to deepen our understanding of the issues raised by students and\nteachers during interviews.\nThe initial stages of each interview explored the topic area and allowed the interviewees to\ndescribe and evaluate their experiences of text-based conferencing, video conferencing or\naudio conferencing in their own words. The issues that they thought were important were\nallowed to emerge using a critical incident approach to the investigation although the\ninterviewer was free to probe and to ask for clarification where necessary. Interviewees\nwere asked to recall instances where communication was particularly successful and\nparticularly unsuccessful and give their understanding of the reasons for this. Where it was\npossible archives were used to situate and stimulate the interviewees. Students who were\ninterviewed about text-based conferencing, for example, were given the opportunity to\naccess and refer to the conferences in question to illustrate, check and qualify their\ncomments. Students and teachers who were interviewed about video conferencing were\nplayed a randomly-selected section from a video conference they had attended or given if\narchive footage existed. In a few instances student focus groups were arranged to follow on\nfrom a video conference that the researcher had also attended and observed. Open\nUniversity students and teachers with experience of telephone conferencing were inter-\nviewed by telephone.\nAnalysis and dissemination\nDue in part to the sheer volume of our interview data, most of the original tape recordings\nwere digitized, organized by case and stored on CDs. These CDs along with the archive\ndata that we have described were then made available to all five members of the research\ngroup for analysis at a 'scanning and sampling' level. A preliminary set of issue codes were\ndebated and agreed upon by all members of the research team to provide a framework for\nfuture analysis. After preliminary analysis responsibility for drafting the case summaries\nwas divided among the five members of the research group although we continued to\ncheck, develop and share our understandings with one another as part of a triangulating\nteam investment. We plan to adopt the same approach to drafting narrative essays which\ndeal with themes that are common across the educational contexts and technologies. These\nwill be drawn from the range of case summaries, which provide scope for comparative\nanalysis, and from the current literature.\nThe recursive and iterative principles that have been described characterized our\nmethodology in one other respect. At key points during analysis and write-up of the case\nsummaries and narrative themes we invited feedback from the teaching sites participating\nin the research in order that all parties could deepen and share their understanding of the\nissues and needs of the educational community. This collaborative-type approach was built\ninto our methodology to help bridge the practice-theory gap.\nThe final document - a staff development resource\nOur final report will be a Web-based hypertext document containing:\n\u2022 a range of case summaries;\n\u2022 narrative essays on overarching themes;\n76\nALT-J Volume 8 Number I\n\u2022 links to existing practice guidelines;\n\u2022 links to other information sources - e.g. JISC, UKEARNA, GLTC and pages on\ncopyright and IPR advice.\nAs already mentioned, the case summaries are intended to present readers with\ninformation in a context-sensitive and therefore meaningful way. From those case\nsummaries and our review of the current literature, narrative essays on overarching themes\nwill be drawn in an attempt to provide a broader interpretative framework.\nBoth the case studies and the narrative essays will be illustrated by notes from the\nliterature, examples from the archives and sound-bites from the interviews. These will be\nstored in a database and accessed by clicking on links in the case studies and narrative\nessays, bringing the document to life.\nThe hypertext document is intended for use by individuals, institutions and by staff\ndevelopment centres. Users and readers can choose between various points of entry and\nfollow different pathways according to their particular needs and interests.\nConclusion\nThe introduction of conferencing technologies has in part been in response to demands for\nmore flexible learning in the context of lifelong learning. Advocates of the technologies\nalso stress that they can, in certain circumstances and with adequate support, improve as\nwell as alter teaching and learning practice. The use of conferencing technologies in further\nand higher education could not be described as mainstream or commonplace but their use\nis increasing, as are pressures for them to be assimilated into the learning arena. The\nintroduction and integration of conferencing technologies has many implications for staff\ndevelopment and training.\nResource materials and courses of a 'how-to' variety already exist within our institutions,\naddressing the cultivation of the technical skills needed to use conferencing technologies in\nteaching and learning. However, an approach which addresses 'how-to' while failing to\nengage with 'why' or how the introduction of a new technology is likely to create a\nparadigm shift is incomplete and unlikely to take things forward. The task that we set\nourselves was to identify effective communication practices and strategies for different\nconferencing technologies and to feed back this information to the educational community.\nIt is our position and the position of activity theorists that adaptations in behaviour or the\ndevelopment of communication skills and strategies happen in response to and in service\nof a specific task. This paper argues that the means of communication should not be\ntreated as something separate in peoples' minds from content or context. If it is true that\nadaptations to new technologies are situated, there is clearly no point in looking for them\nin artificial settings. By the same token there is little point in feedback information to the\neducational community in an abstract way if the information is to remain meaningful.\nWe therefore opted to examine and present findings from a range of real cases. These cases\nwere drawn from a range of higher and further education institutions. The lecturers at\nthese institutions provided courses in a spread of subject disciplines to a variety of learners\n- undergraduates, postgraduates, professional, full- and part-time students. It is our hope\nthat by presenting a range of case summaries, the report will increase the likelihood of\n77\nKerry Mussebrook et al Learning networks and communication skills\nteachers recognizing circumstances and issues that are similar to their own. This is not to\nsay, however, that narrative themes common across different conferencing technologies and\ncontexts cannot be developed to provide a broader interpretative framework. The final\nstaff development resource that we currently envisage will incorporate case summaries,\nnarrative themes and other useful links to form a hypertext document with different points\nof entry and pathways through it to suit individuals' learning needs.\nThe collaborative and iterative approach which we have adopted throughout this research\nproject, both within the research group and with the various teaching sites, should ensure\nthat the needs of the educational community are understood and served to the best of our\nability. We are hopeful that our methodology can help to bridge what is commonly referred\nto as the practice-theory gap.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank the Joint Information Systems Committee for funding this\nresearch project as part of their CALT (Committee for Awareness of Learning and\nTeaching) Networked Learning Initiative.
