Since then, in the wake of \ndevolution and with varying degrees of emphasis, the need to tackle health inequalities \nhas been highlighted as a policy priority in all three mainland UK countries.   This short \npaper reports on findings from a major cross-national studya investigating what \ndifference devolution makes to how health inequalities are problematised and acted \nupon at local level in England, Scotland and Wales.  A key aspect of the study was a \ncomparison between the different countries which have been seen as taking different \npaths responding to health inequalities, and diverging in both health policy and \nperformance assessment1. \n \nParticular attention was given to the role that contrasting performance assessment \nregimes might have played in informing variations in national responses to health \ninequalities.  There have been few studies of performance assessment regarding health \ninequalities.  Exworthy et al.2 explored the implementation gap between policy on \nhealth inequalities and local action in England.  They identified a number of obstacles to \nprogress, including the dominance of waiting lists in performance management and a \nlack of engagement by local authorities.  Hunter and Marks3 identified similar problems \n                                                 \na\n Performance assessment and \u2018wicked issues\u2019: the case of health inequalities  \n(ESRC ref. RES-153-25-0079)  \n 6 \nwith NHS targets and their extension into health improvement and health inequalities. \nThe evaluations of the English Health Action Zones reveal this complexity, with the \nHAZs taking different approaches to inequalities and their goals and targets varying \naccording to local context 4.  Other studies have drawn attention to how decision \nmaking in health takes place in a context of uncertainty and competing priorities4,5,6,7.  \n \nThe focus of this paper is on comparing the story that emerged from the analysis of \nnational policy statements with the first round of narrative accounts gathered in 2006 \nthat emerged from interviews with individuals working in the local organisations \ncharged with much of the responsibility for addressing health inequalities.  \n \n \nMethods \n \nIn order to explore this issue, key policy statements published between May 1997 and \nMay 2007 were analysed.  Concurrently, data from stakeholder interviews in eight case \nstudy localities carried out in 2006 were analysed to determine the extent of alignment \nbetween policy and practice at a local level in each of the three countries.  \n \nAssessments of national policy conceptualisations of health inequalities were garnered \nthrough the discourse and thematic analysis8 of major policy documents published \nbetween May 1997 and May 2007 (i.e. those published immediately prior to devolution \n(1997-1999), when the UK government was responsible for health policy in all three \n 7 \ncountries, and those published in the three countries during the first (1999-2003) and \nsecond (2003-2007) terms of devolved government in Scotland and Wales).   \nOwing to the volume of official publications relating to health inequalities in each \ncountry, it was decided to include only national policy statements of significant \nrelevance to health inequalities, notably White Papers and related documents and \nnational guidance on how health inequalities should be tackled.  Advisory and \nconsultative documents for England and Wales were not included on the assumption \nthat, where aspects of consultative or advisory documents have successfully informed \npolicy decisions, these aspects should be visible in subsequent policy statements.  \nHowever, as Wales did not have primary legislative making powers during the study \nperiod, key consultative documents published here were included, especially those \nwhich are referred to in later documents as having set the national agenda.  In total 75 \ndocuments were included in the analysis (33 from England, 24 from Scotland, and 18 \nfrom Wales).  \n \nThe exploration of local responses to health inequalities was based on interviews with \nrelevant key stakeholders working in the NHS (Primary Care Trusts, Local Health \nBoards and Health Boards), local government and partnership organisations (Local \nStrategic Partnerships; Health, Social Care and Well-being strategy groups; Community \nHealth Partnerships) in 8 localities in the three countries (3 in England, 3 in Wales, 2 in \nScotland).  The Case study localities were chosen because they had contexts that \nrepresent a challenge for health improvement and have similar geographical profiles of \nregional cities and post-industrial areas across the three countries.   \n \n 8 \nThe in-depth qualitative interviews were undertaken with key stakeholders (n=130) \nwithin the eight case study sites between May and August 2006.   The key stakeholders \nrepresented a range of positions at strategic and operational level such as Chief \nExecutives, Performance Managers, Directors of Public Health, Finance Directors and \nChairs of partnership organisations.  Interview data were supplemented with \ninformation from Local Delivery Plans, performance assessment reports and statistics \nrelating to health inequalities.   \n \n \nResults \n1. The story told by the policy statements \nPolicies in all three countries have consistently emphasised the need to tackle health \ninequalities from 1997 onwards (i.e. both before and after devolution) and all three \ncountries have focused on health differences between socio-economic groups and \ngeographical areas (significantly more than, for example, the ethnic and gender based \nhealth inequalities which are also acknowledged).  However, the three countries have \ntaken quite different approaches to performance assessment of public health issues and \nto the setting of relevant targets.     \n \nEngland was the first of the three countries to introduce quantifiable national targets for \nreducing health inequalities, in 2001.  Initially there were two separate targets; one \nwhich focused on a reduction in the infant mortality gap between manual groups and the \nrest of the population and another which focused on reducing the life expectancy gap \nbetween the fifth of areas with the worst health and deprivation indicators and the \n 9 \nEngland average (both to be achieved by 2010)9,10.  These formed Public Service \nAgreements which the Department of Health is expected to meet, cascaded down to \nlocalities and underpinned by secondary targets for circulatory diseases, cancers and \nsmoking11.  \n \nScotland also introduced quantifiable national targets for reducing health inequalities \ntargets but at a later date, in 2004.  However, despite a previous commitment to setting \nthe targets around narrowing a \u2018health gap\u201912, the targets that were eventually \nintroduced were  health improvement targets with a specific focus on the most deprived \nareas13.   Until 2006 \u2018health gaps\u2019 continued to be monitored as part of the Scottish \nperformance assessment framework, but the introduction of a new performance \nmanagement system based on a core set of key Ministerial targets (Health, Efficiency, \nAccess and Treatment \u2013 HEAT - targets) effectively removed performance assessment \nof narrowing \u2018health gaps\u2019 (although these are still measured) and reinforced a \nconceptualisation of health inequalities as a problem of \u2018health disadvantage\u2019 needing a \nhealth improvement response rather than explicit targeting of health inequality14. \n \nWales had not introduced quantifiable national targets for specifically reducing health \ninequalities in the study period, preferring to opt for aspirational statements that are not \nquantified but indicate a desired direction of travel.  Indeed, much of the language in the \ndocuments that were analysed suggests Welsh policymakers were less concerned with \ntargets than their colleagues in England and Scotland.  An expert group to advise on \nmeasuring health inequalities had been established in 2001 but although it \nrecommended that the Welsh Assembly Government should monitor \u2018health gaps\u2019 \n 10 \nbetween areas, the Group advised against setting specific, national health inequalities \ntargets.  Instead, members suggested that avoiding short or medium term targets would \nfacilitate a longer-term (and more effective) approach to the issue by allowing \npolicymakers to focus on the wider social determinants of health.  However, the absence \nof any quantified objectives makes it impossible to assess the success or failure of \nWelsh policies to tackle health inequalities by reference to a specific policy \ncommitment.  \n \nWhilst different approaches to performance assessment and targets were therefore \nclearly visible in the three countries, the discourse and thematic analysis of key \npolicy documents suggests that this did not appear to inspire significantly different \npolicy thinking about health inequalities at a national level15.  Instead, a remarkably \nsimilar story emerged from this strand of the research.  In each case, as Table 1 \nillustrates, early statements (pre 2003) emphasise the importance of tackling \u2018wider\u2019 \ndeterminants of health and of health inequalities (such as social exclusion, poor housing \nand inequalities of opportunity) as well as underlining the need to address differential \npatterns of lifestyle behaviour (the former often being articulated as a key cause of the \nlatter).  Documents from this era also frequently refer to the important role of central \ngovernment in tackling health inequalities, as well as to that of the public sector and \nindividuals.  However, around 2003-2005, the statements in all three countries visibly \nshift, with increasing emphasis being placed on: \n\u2022 The need to tackle lifestyle-behaviours (smoking, diet, alcohol consumption, \netc). \n\u2022 The responsibility of individuals \n 11 \n\u2022 Clinical priorities and the role of the NHS \n \nThe post-2003 policy statements in Scotland and England largely continue to emphasise \nthe importance of tackling health inequalities but a shift is noticeable with regard to the \nemphasis placed on the preferred means of achieving this aim.  In Wales, however, \nwhere the initial emphasis on tackling the wider determinants of health was perhaps \nmost overt, this shift was more substantive, representing a move away from official \ninterest in tackling social determinants of health and health inequalities to a focus on \nwaiting times and health improvement (this shift is discussed in greater detail \nelsewhere15). \n \n \n2. Interviews and policies compared \nThis section present results from the interview data and how these link to the policy \nfindings, addressing the following three questions: \n\u2022 Did the way in which health inequalities were conceptualised by interviewees \nreflect conceptualisations in the policy statements?  \n\u2022 Were the different policy approaches to targets and performance management \nreflected in the way interviewees in local bodies described approaches to the \nperformance management of health inequalities? \n\u2022 Was the cross-country shift in emphasis that was visible in the policy statements \n(circa 2003-2005) reflected in the interview data? \n \nConceptualisation of health inequalities \n \n 12 \nThe interviews in all countries revealed extremely varied definitions of health \ninequalities, even within the same organisation.   For example, definitions included \ngeographical differences in health within localities, geographical differences between \nlocalities and the national average, inequalities between different ethnic groups, \ninequalities in access to services (particularly in relation to rural areas), the unique \nhealth concerns of population groups who were considered \u2018vulnerable\u2019 (such as people \nexperiencing mental health problems, those with learning disabilities, and people with \ndrug and alcohol dependencies).  Few respondents referred to specific definitions of \nhealth inequalities from either local corporate plans or national policy statements, \nrevealing the lack of shared definitions.  There was, though, widespread reference to the \nsocial model of health and understanding of the impact of wider determinants on health \ninequalities. \n \nThe reduction of health inequalities was seen as a long-term challenge and many health \nproblems were seen as a legacy of past heavy employment, deprivation and job losses: \n\"So we had a lot of problems\u2026 also since then obviously those industries have come \nand gone but left a legacy in the community.  You\u2019re then moving into an area where of \ncourse we\u2019ve got deprivation, poor diet etc which of course doesn\u2019t really help people \nto lead healthy lives either.  So we\u2019ve got all those sort of historical problems.\"  CEO \nWales \n \nThere were some differences between the countries.  In England, the areas in which the \ninterviews were conducted had small BME populations and ethnicity was not seen as a \nmain focus for health inequalities.  Ethnicity was an important consideration in Wales \n 13 \nand Scotland, despite our fieldwork areas also mostly having small BME populations, \nand this was perceived as being driven by the social inclusion policy agenda of the \ngovernment.   \n \nOrganisations in all countries were measuring gaps in life expectancy within localities \nas well as comparing with national figures. However, within areas of high deprivation \n(within different countries) there was some questioning of the relevance of within \nlocality differences: \n\"All of the wards in Locality 10 are among the most deprived wards in terms of \nhealth nationally so I couldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s particularly necessary for us to have \na definition that would allow us to say these three particular wards in Locality \n10 are suffering most health inequality, because generally it\u2019s a picture that is \npretty prevalent across the board.\" CEO England \n \nAccess to services was seen as an important factor in health inequalities in some of the \npost-industrial localities in all countries, and in areas with low levels of health services \nin Wales and England.   \n \nAs with the policy analysis, the interviews showed few differences in conceptualising \nhealth inequalities between countries.  There was widespread reference to the wider \ndeterminants of health, and measuring gaps in life expectancy within localities as well \nas nationally.  There were slight differences in emphasis (towards social inclusion and \nhealth improvement in Scotland and Wales) but a similar focus on the poor health of \nparticular groups rather than social gradients in health.   \n 14 \n \nPerformance management  \nThe ways in which health inequalities were being monitored did vary significantly in \nline with findings from the policy documents.  In Wales, there was no systematic \nmonitoring of progress in tackling health inequalities, although the Health Social Care \nand Well Being Strategies drawn up jointly by the local health boards and local councils \nincluded statements about reducing health inequalities.  In England there was systematic \nmonitoring and performance management of health inequality targets by the Department \nof Health through Public Service Agreements.  In Scotland health inequalities were \nbeing monitored through performance reviews of Health Boards and Community Health \nPartnerships at the time of the interviews.  However, there was explicit rejection of what \nwas often referred to as the \u2018command and control\u2019 strategies or \u2018market-driven\u2019 \nsystems of England:  \n\"Well, the politics of Scotland are very different to the politics of England.  The \nNHS in Scotland bears very little resemblance to the NHS in England and that \nhas all happened in the last eight years.  And it\u2019s quite remarkable how quickly \nthe Scottish ethos has been around collaboration, co-operation, health \nimprovement, narrowing health inequalities.\"  Director of Public Health \nScotland \nThis emphasis on differences in the \u2018ethos\u2019 between countries recurred frequently in the \nScottish interviews. \n \nIn all countries organisations regarded themselves as having robust performance \nmanagement systems. However, there were mixed views about the desirability of \n 15 \nperformance management.  For example, some respondents regarded it as providing a \nfocus on health inequalities which would not otherwise be there, while others thought \nthat the performance systems were too burdensome and focused on the easily \nmeasurable rather than pertinent outcomes.  Again these views were not peculiar to any \none country even though the policies on health inequalities targets and performance \nassessment differed between the 3 countries.  Penalties for not reducing waiting times \nand ensuring financial balance made these key priorities for organisations and meant \nthat action to reduce health inequalities was pushed further down the agenda.  Although \nthere was a desire to reduce health inequalities, there was little plausible modelling of \nwhether programmes to reduce health inequalities would enable targets to be met.  This \nwas even true of England where there was a strong emphasis on performance \nassessment to achieve targets. \n \nDespite differences in monitoring and some evidence of divergence in response to \nperformance management regimes, the reduction of health inequalities was consistently \nacross countries a lower priority than reducing waiting times and ensuring financial \nbalance and had not resulted in divergence in terms of plausible modelling to achieve \ntargets. \n \nShifts towards lifestyles, individuals, role of the NHS? \nIn all countries there was a dominance of clinical and NHS financial priorities.  There \nwas little evidence of mainstreaming public health programmes.  Many of the \nprogrammes were project-based around changing lifestyles (e.g. Five-a-day \nprogrammes, healthy eating, exercise on prescription).  The wider determinants of \n 16 \nhealth were acknowledged quite strongly, and some organisations regarded their \nprogrammes of benefit take-up campaigns, prioritising home insulation, and \nregeneration as ones that would contribute to improving health.  Nevertheless, when \nasked about how their organisations were responding to health inequalities, most \nrespondents referred to lifestyle programmes.   \n \nThere is some evidence from the interviews of a shift in emphasis towards lifestyles and \nclinical solutions in England with the new focus on \u201cquick wins\u201d by targeting the \nprescribing of statins, anti-hypertensives and smoking cessation aids. This is a \nsomewhat paradoxical outcome of the specific but relatively short-term targets for \nreducing geographical health inequalities in England by 2010, encouraging \norganisations to focus on the \"quick wins\" achievable through clinical interventions, \nrather than on tackling the underlying determinants of health inequalities. In Wales local \norganisations were focusing on health improvement and were also clear that in the post-\nJane Hutt b era the policy focus had shifted to clinical priorities (although this was more \nacknowledged than particularly welcomed).  The focus on chronic illnesses, access to \nservices and a need for more GPs reflected national policy concerns in Wales but meant \nthe emphasis was on NHS services rather than wider determinants of health.  In Scottish \ninterviews the importance of the Smoking Ban was frequently emphasised, and \nalthough a key public heath initiative, its impact on inequalities remains unclear.   \n \n \n \n                                                 \nb\n Jane Hutt was Health Minister for the Welsh Assembly Government from 1999 to January 2005 when \nshe was moved following criticism of long hospital waiting lists. \n 17 \nDiscussion \nIt is important to note that this study is multifaceted and this short paper necessarily \nobscures some of this complexity.  It should also be noted that there are inevitable \nchallenges both in comparing policy statements with respondents' accounts and in \ncomparing different countries to each other through reference to case studies within \nthose countries (particularly when these case studies incorporate a range of different \norganisations and population profiles). It is clearly difficult to capture local nuances and \nreflect the subtle, qualitative differences in style and values in each locale and thus the \nanalysis has necessarily to be broad brush.  However, the research was set up to \ninvestigate health inequalities as a 'wicked issue' in the context of differing approaches \nto performance assessment; what it offers is a reflection of how an array of interviewees \nin a variety local contexts (both in terms of organisational setting and socio-economic \ncontext) have interpreted and put into practice policy guidance.  Whilst not \nunproblematic, and clearly acknowledged as time-bounded, this approach provides an \nimportant insight into how the three countries making up post-devolution Britain are \nresponding to the challenges of reducing health inequalities; an area that has so far \nreceived relatively little research attention. This paper provides a useful snapshot of the \nhow far and how fast devolution is impacting on policy divergence in this complex \narena of health inequalities. \n \nThe analysis of policy statements undertaken for this project reveals a visible shift in \npolicy approaches to health inequalities at the national level, which occurred in all three \ncountries around 2003-2005.  Whilst wider determinants of health still feature in more \nrecent policy statements, the emphasis on lifestyle behaviours, individual responsibility \n 18 \nfor health and clinical interventions all gained greater prominence15.  The interview data \ndo not significantly challenge this finding, suggesting that, despite widespread \nawareness of the wider determinants of health, interventions which involved (frequently \ntargeted) attempts to change people\u2019s lifestyles and behaviours were more prominent.  \nFurthermore, the interview data from 2006 support the finding from the policy analysis \nthat: (i) in England, there has been a growing interest in the role that NHS and \npharmacological interventions can play in tackling health inequalities; and (ii) that \npolicy interest in public health issues in Wales has been pushed aside to some extent by \na focus on health service related and clinical concerns.  Such a shift was not so \ndetectable in the Scottish interview data, although this may be a reflection of the timing \nof the interviews, rather than a more concrete difference.  In 2007, after the change of \ngovernment, Scotland did initiate a Ministerial Review on Health Inequalities showing \nthe growing prominence of the issue.  \n \nThe story which emerged from our analysis of public health policy documents differed \nsubstantially from accounts which claim a \u2018natural experiment\u2019 in health policy is \noccurring within the UK (e.g. Greer8,16,17,18).  This suggests the differences in \napproaches to key public health concerns have perhaps been less than the differences in \ntheir approaches to health services. For, at least as far as health inequalities are \nconcerned, whilst some differences are perceptible, it is the similarities that invite the \nmost explanation. \n \nA key factor may be the way in which \u2018health inequalities\u2019 have consistently been \nconceptualised as a problem relating to the poor health of poor people (or people in poor \n 19 \nareas), rather than as an issue which traverses the whole of society.  As Table 2 \nillustrates (drawing on concepts developed by Graham and Kelly14), conceptualisations \nof health inequalities as an issue of \u2018health disadvantage\u2019 are prevalent in policy \ndiscourses in all three contexts, whereas references to \u2018social gradients in health\u2019 are \nrare.  As Graham and Kelly14 outline the former conceptualisation implies that targeted \nattempts to improve the health of particular groups are a logical response, whereas the \nlatter suggests a broader, societal response is required.  Other factors which may \naccount for the similar policy discourses concerning health inequalities, such as \npolitical, ideological and institutional similarities between the three countries, are \ndiscussed elsewhere15,19.   \n \nLike much policy-orientated research, this project is taking place against a shifting \npolicy backdrop.  Performance management systems, organisational structures and \nnational political leadership and governments have all changed during the lifetime of the \nproject and the account presented in this paper may soon be superseded, particularly \nnow the political leadership of all three countries has differentiated.  Initial indications \nfrom a second round of interviews completed in June 2008 suggest that policy and \npractice relating to health inequalities are beginning to diverge more significantly. This \npossibility will be explored in detail in the final report from this study, which is due to \nbe published in February 2009.    \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe would like to thank all the respondents and the Advisory Group for their \ncontributions.
