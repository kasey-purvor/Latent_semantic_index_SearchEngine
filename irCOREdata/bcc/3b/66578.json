This paper examines flood frequencies in three coastal sectors of Britain and \nanalyses the associated storm tracks and their principal pathways. The results indicate \nthat the east coast of Britain has suffered most floods over the last 200 years. The \nfrequencies of flood incidents in the south and southwest coast of Britain have increased, \nparticularly during the 20th century, whereas on the west coast flood frequencies have \ndeclined. Three distinctive pathways of storm track are identified, related to flood \nincidents in each coastal sector. A southern pathway in a corridor along the 55oN parallel \nis associated with flood incidents recorded on the south and southwest coast, whilst \nstorms that are associated with floods on the west coast concentrate along the 60oN \nparallel. The relationship between the frequencies of floods and climatic variations needs \nto be explored further. However, the development of coastal settlements has certainly \nincreased vulnerability, and hence the risk of flood disasters. \n \nKey words: Storm, coastal flood, frequency, storm track, historical records \n \n \n1. Introduction \n \nOver the last few hundred years, human settlements have flourished in the coastal \nlowlands of the British Isles. Many of these lowlands and their settlements have been \nsubject to sea floods and have relied on the protection of artificial sea defences. \nHowever, storm surges have often exceeded the level of protection, resulting in \nconsiderable losses of property. Among many flood incidents, the 1953 storm surge and \nflood in eastern England resulted in the inundation of 24,000 houses and 200 major \nindustrial premises (Spalding, 1954). On a smaller scale in Towyn in 1990, some 2800 \nhouses were flooded, and repairs to the whole housing stock damaged were estimated to \ncost between \u00a322.4 million and \u00a3100.8 million (Tooley, 1992) (approximately $35.8 \nmillion to $161.3 million). Knowledge of the magnitude and frequency of coastal floods \n 3\nis of great value to central and local authorities for land-use planning, environmental \nagencies for coastal management and insurers for evaluating their underwriting \nstrategies.  \n \nCoastal floods are a consequence of a set of factors including storm-induced surge, \nhigh tide (particularly on macro-tidal coasts with tidal ranges of over 4m) and high \nwaves (Townsend, 1981), as well as the condition, nature, strength and height of the \ncoastal and estuarine defences. In many coastal locations, storm-induced surges may \nbe magnified due to the configuration and bathymetry of the shallow seas around the \nBritish Isles, as well as the location and geometry of estuaries. The combination of \nthese factors thus creates a real possibility of continuing and increased coastal flood \nhazard. However, due to climate change such as atmospheric temperature variations \n(e.g. Parker et al., 2000) and oscillations of atmospheric pressure (e.g. North Atlantic \nOscillation (NAO) index , Hurrell, 1995), the possibility of flooding has not been \nconstant. The numbers of storm generated over the North Atlantic are closely related \nto temperature variations (Lamb, 1991), whilst, the NAO index reflects the strength of \nsurface westerlies over Europe especially in the winter (Wilby et al., 1997), and thus \nis related to the pathways of storms or low-pressure cells. Furthermore, a strong high-\npressure system over Scandinavia can block low-pressure cells from moving \neastwards, and divert them towards the Norwegian Sea or south-eastwards into the \nBay of Biscay and English Channel (Knox and Hay, 1985) where the storm surges \nmay be amplified.  \n \nThe objectives of this paper are first to establish the frequencies of flooding in three \ncoastal sectors, and secondly to test whether the floods there are associated with \ndifferent storm track pathways. The three coastal sectors (figure 1) are: (1) the East \nCoast from Aberdeen in Scotland to Ramsgate in Kent, (2) the South and Southwest \ncoast from Dover in Kent to Milford Haven in South Wales, and (3) the West Coast \nfrom southwest Wales to Glasgow in Scotland. These divisions are based on coastal \norientation and a preliminary investigation (e.g. Zong and Tooley, 1995), which \nsuggested that recent flood events on the three coastal sectors are associated with \nstorm tracks that travelled along spatially different pathways. The history of coastal \nfloods for other parts of Scotland can be studied by Hickey (1998). \n \n 4\n \n2. The Study Area \n \nThe British coast is characterised morphologically by a variety of different landscapes. \nThere are estuaries and headlands of solid rock or unconsolidated sediments of glacio-\ngenic origin. Low-lying areas are common adjacent to estuaries, with ground altitudes \nclose to local high-tide level. In England and Wales, alone, there are 750,000 ha of \nground below +5 m Ordnance Datum (OD). Mean High Water is in some places \nrecorded at altitudes higher than +5 m OD and the Highest Astronomical Tide \nsignificantly exceeds this value proportionally. \n \nIn the three coastal sectors, the 18th century saw little progress in urban and industrial \ndevelopments on the coastal lowlands, except for seaports and a few seaside resorts.  \nDuring the early 19th century, a large number of coastal towns emerged owing to the \nadvent of the railways and road networks and people\u2019s desire to visit seaside resorts at \nweekends. These coastal towns expanded constantly in the late 19th century and the \n20th century. While enjoying the coastal amenities, residents had to adapt to flood \nhazards.  Settlements have followed such a development disaster cycle that most of \nthese towns were originally built on relatively higher lands (2m to 3m above the local \nhigh spring tides level). As a consequence of the rapid increase in population since the \nearly 20th century, many towns expanded onto lower lands where protection from \nregular floods by the sea was provided by the construction and strengthening of sea \ndefences. For example, settlements were firstly developed at Benfleet and Southend-\non-Sea, Essex and subsequently from the 1920s extended onto Canvey Island where \nground altitude ranges from 0.5m to 1.9m below local mean high water of spring tides \n(MHWST) (Zong, 1993).  In other areas, coastal lowlands were reclaimed and drained \nfor agricultural production. Consequently, the ground level became lower due to peat \nwastage, de-watering and sediment consolidation. \n \nAs perceived by the general public and even policy makers before the 1980s, the \ngreater the development on these coastal lowlands, the greater benefits that can be \nseen from flood protection.  An increase in the level of protection afforded from \nraised sea embankments has resulted in a rising residential population and urban \nexpansion on the protected lowlands.  However, on many occasions, extreme floods \nhave exceeded the capabilities of the protection system and caused great losses in \n 5\nproperty (Zong et al., 1995). A typical example is Morecambe in Lancashire which \nwas only a village with 2500 residents before the 1850s. It expanded and by the early \n1920s it had a population of over 23,000. The rising population was accommodated \nby housing development extending from higher ground (1.5m to 3.5m above local \nMHWST) to the surrounding areas of lower altitudes (0m to 1.5m above local \nMHWST) (Zong, 1993). After the severe flood in 1907, the first hard sea defence was \nconstructed, and further strengthened in the late 1920s and early 1950s. Such a level \nof protection helped encourage more people to settle, and the population rose to over \n40,000 in the 1980s. Despite the improvement of sea defences, the town was flooded \nin 1977, 1983 and 1990. Similar cases can be seen in Towyn, Wales (Jones, 1992; \nTooley 1992) and Canvey Island, Essex (Cracknell, 1959). Since the 1980s, the \nawareness of environmental issues has increased, and stringent planning policies have \nbeen in place.  \n \n \n3. Data Sources \n \nIn this study, archival flood records were collected and examined for the reconstruction \nof the flood history for the study area. By examining synoptic weather charts, the \nassociated storms were identified, and their tracks were recorded for the analysis of \nstorm pathways. \n \n3.1. Archival flood records \nAccounts of historical sea floods were primarily collected from microfilms of The Times.  \nAn initial search was made in the two series of indexes to The Times, i.e. Palmer's Index \n(from 1785 until 1917) and The Official Index (from 1917 to present).  Cross checking \nwith the microfilms of The Times was undertaken to obtain details of a specific incident. \nBased upon the floods indexed for supplementary information, speculative searches \nwere also conducted at local Public Record Offices where local newspapers, Quarter \nSessions petitions, published and manuscript diaries, school logbooks, family and estate \nletters and papers, and parish registers were examined.  Some church accounts, estate \nletters and diaries proved useful for their detailed descriptions of flood events, \nparticularly prior to Palmer's Index. \n \n 6\nFor the period before the publication of synoptic charts, Palmer's Index and The Official \nIndex are the best source from which to compile at least a preliminary list of storm dates \non which to base further searches.  However in its early days, The Times did not always \nreceive regular news from the northern counties and did not record some smaller storms, \neven though they were locally significant.  The record, therefore, only reflects storms \nthat resulted in major floods and were reported nationally. \n \n3.2. Synoptic and tidal conditions \nDaily, weekly and monthly weather reports published by the Meteorological Office for \nthe period since 1911 were examined. The synoptic condition of storms revealed in the \nhistorical flood records and the tracks of the associated low-pressure cells were analysed. \nThe storm tracks were copied onto a grid map covering an area of 20oW to 20oE and \n65oN to 45oN (Figure 2).  The frequency of these low-pressure cells passing through \neach grid (2.5o Latitude by 5o Longitude) was then counted. Information on wind speeds \nthat are associated with the low-pressure cells was obtained from the ports of Heysham \n(near Morecambe), Lowestoft and Milford Haven, while hourly records of wave-\nsmoothed water level recorded at these seaports were provided by the British \nOceanographic Data Centre, Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory. Both wind speed \nand water level data cover various lengths of time, mostly the last 30 years.  \n \n4. Three Recent Floods \nIn order to understand storm conditions in relation to the floods in the three coastal \nsectors, major flood events (e.g. Lamb, 1991; Zong and Tooley, 1995) were analysed. \nThe spatial relationship between the flooded locations and the associated storm tracks \nsuggests that different pathways of storms (or low-pressure cells) were related to floods \nat different coastal sectors. From the weather reports, 117 storm tracks are retrieved. Out \nof the 117 storms, three typical flood events are selected to demonstrate this relationship. \nThese events prove the legitimacy of dividing the British coast into three sectors for the \nsubsequent analyses. The tracks of the associated low-pressure cells are shown in Figure \n2. \n \nThe 1953 flood in the East Coast: On the 30th January 1953, a low-pressure cell moved \neastwards over the north Atlantic. During the daytime, the central pressure of the cell \ndecreased from 988 mB to 968 mB. It turned south-eastwards into the North Sea on the \n 7\nfollowing day. The tidal surge generated by this low-pressure cell was amplified to 2.3m \nas it was pushed southwards, and met the high tide peak near the southern end of the \nNorth Sea. The strong pressure gradient on the west part of the system helped generate \nstrong winds (sustained surface winds up to 29 m\/s) along the east shore of England. \nSevere waves were deflected towards the coast of East Anglia. This storm caused \nwidespread floods on the East Coast between the River Tees estuary and Dover (Steers, \n1971). \n \nThe 1977 flood in the West Coast: During the 9th to 12th November 1977, a well-\nestablished low-pressure cell moved north-eastwards clipping the north coast of \nScotland. Over this period, the barometric pressure of the low-pressure cell decreased \nfrom 972 mB to 960 mB at its centre. Associated with the low-pressure cell, strong \nwesterly winds (sustained surface winds up to 25 m\/s) were recorded along the English \ncoast of the Irish Sea. These onshore winds generated waves which pounded on the sea \ndefences of Morecambe and many other coastal towns. The low-pressure cell also \ninduced a major tidal surge into the Irish Sea. As recorded at Heysham, the surge was \n1.8 m high and occurred one to two hours earlier than the peak of a high spring tide \n(Zong and Tooley, 1995). The combined effects of high tide, storm surge and waves \ncaused the sea defence in Morecambe to fail and flooding occurred in the early hours of \nthe 12th November with floodwater of c. 0.5m deep in a number of places. \n \nThe 1981 flood in the South and Southwest Coast: After a cold spell in the middle of \nDecember, a couple of low-pressure cells developed over the North Atlantic. One of the \nlow-pressure cells was generated on the 28th December with a central pressure of 960 \nmB. This cell moved eastwards and entered the English Channel during the 30th when a \ntidal surge of 0.9m was generated at Milford Haven, Wales. The water level was raised \nto 3.5m above m.s.l., when the surge met with the high tide. During the 30th when the \nlow-pressure cell travelled through the English Channel, the narrow isobars on the \neastern part of the system generated strong onshore winds (sustained surface winds up to \n22 m\/s). As a result, high waves lashed the seafront of the south coast and caused \nflooding in a number of locations (see Table 2). \n \nThese three coastal floods seem to confirm that the key conditions for major coastal \nflooding include (1) a significantly high tidal surge occurring around a high spring \n 8\ntide at a given coastal locality (Townsend, 1981) and (2) strong onshore (or along-\nshore) winds that generate high waves (Golding, 1981). Thus, it can be hypothesised \nthat such conditions occurring in each coastal sector are associated with a specific \nspatial pathway of low-pressure cells (Figure 2). \n \nThere is a lack of information on waves. Judging by the limited wind fetch within the \nIrish Sea, English Channel and the North Sea, waves may not be very high, but \nsufficiently strong to damage sea defences particularly when sea walls are in poor \ncondition. Based on observations over 18 months from October 1974 to March 1976 \nin the Irish Sea (Hydraulics Research Station, 1976), significant wave heights \noffshore for different return periods were calculated (Table 1). A few years later, the \ninshore significant wave heights for the 1977 event were established based on \nobserved meteorological conditions (Allott & Lomax Consulting Engineers, 1979).  \n \n5. Frequencies \nThe frequencies of coastal flooding for each decade since the 1780s show contrasting \npictures between the three coastal sectors (Figure 3). The decade data were smoothed \nwith a 5-term binomial filter, in which the smoothed value for each decade was a \nweighted average of a window of 5 decades with weights in the ratio 1:4:6:4:1. A 3-\nterm binomial filter and copying of end values were used towards the ends of the \nseries. \n \nIn total, the East Coast has experienced much higher flood frequencies than other \nsectors. Overlying the inter-decadal variability, the flood history of the East Coast can \nbe divided into four phases. Firstly, the 1780s to 1840s saw a steady increase in flood \nfrequency (Figure 3), followed by the second phase, the 1850s to 1900s, when flood \nfrequencies fluctuated. These two phases coincided with the generally cool conditions \nduring the late 18th and early 19th centuries (e.g. Jones and Bradley, 1992). There is a \nmark increase in flood frequency from the 1910s to 1930s. Such an increase seems to \ncorrespond to a rise in atmospheric temperature of the Northern Hemisphere (e.g. Fu \net al., 1999; Parker et al., 2000) and strong positive NAO indexes (e.g. Hurrell, 1995), \ni.e. a warmer climate and stronger westerly airflow over the Northern Atlantic and \nEurope. The final phase, i.e. since the 1940s, saw relatively low numbers of floods \nexcept the 1950s and 1980s. This generally declining trend in flood frequency is \n 9\nassociated with a small decrease in temperature and a negative NAO indexes between \nthe 1940s and 1970s. However, it is noted that the slightly high flood frequency in the \n1980s seem to coincide with the rise in temperature and the positive NAO indexes.  \nBut the low number of floods in the 1990s does not fit with the climate trend. \n \nRelatively lower numbers of floods were recorded for the South and Southwest Coasts \nfor the 19th century. From the 1890s to 1940s, flood frequencies increased steadily, \napparently coincided with the rise of temperature and positive NAO indexes. The \ndeclining flood frequencies during the 1950s and 1960s are associated with the small \ndecrease of temperature and evidently negative NAO indexes. However, the relatively \nhigh number of floods in the 1970s does not correlate well with the relatively low \ntemperature (e.g. Parker et al., 2000). Further decline in flood frequency since the \n1970s contradict with the fact that temperature rose and the NAO indexes appeared \nstrongly positive during this period. \n \nOn the West Coast, the number of flood incidents was relatively consistent for the \nperiod between 1780s and 1860s, after which flood frequency rose to its highest in the \n1890s. Such a trend seems to contradict the changes in temperature and there is no \ncorrelation with the NAO indexes. Since the 1890s, there has been a general decline \nin flood frequency, with the one exception of higher number recorded for the 1920s \nand associated with a rise in temperature. The slight increase in flood frequency in the \nlast three decades seems to coincide with the rising temperature and positive NAO \nindexes. \n \nThe above analyses suggest that the variability of flood frequencies recorded since the \n1780s from the three coastal sectors (Figure 3) seems to a certain extent related to \nclimate change, particularly the temperature of the Northern Hemisphere and the \nNAO index. However, there are also mismatches between flood frequencies and \nclimatic variables. Notable is the fact that the rapid rise in temperature and NAO \nindex since the 1980s has not resulted in a sharp increase in flood incidence. This \nparticular discordance may be explained by the fact that flood defence systems have \nbeen greatly strengthened, and thus the vulnerability to flood hazard has been \nreduced. For example, after the infamous flood of 1953, the Thames Barrier was \nconstructed in the 1980s and the associated sea and estuarine defences further \n 10\nstrengthened and raised. Consequently, flood incidents recorded from the Thames \nestuary reduced substantially (Table 2). On the South Coast the majority of floods \nrecorded between the 1940s and 1980s is from newly extended coastal towns. Such an \nincreased vulnerability has resulted in an increase in the incidents of flood. Since the \n1980s, flood frequencies have declined sharply, which may be attributed to the latest \nimprovement to the sea defences, i.e. a reduction of vulnerability. Therefore, the flood \nrecords in Figure 3 reflect the variability of risk since the 1780s, i.e. the risk of coastal \nfloods is the interaction of the hazard (storms or physical phenomena, see White, \n1974) and vulnerability (exposure of human society to hazard, see Hewitt, 1983).  \n \n6. Storm Tracks \nFor the floods on the East Coast, 51 storm tracks were examined for the period between \n1910 and 1995. The frequencies of these storms passing each grid are shown in Figure 4. \nThis diagram shows high frequencies of storm tracks in the north and central North Sea, \nrepresenting a principal pathway as indicated by the arrow. This pathway, as typified by \nthe 1953 event (Figure 2), implies that storm cells passing over northern Britain and \nturning south-eastwards into the North Sea are most likely to cause flooding on the East \nCoast. This is because storm cells over the North Sea can generate tidal surges and \nwaves that affect the East Coast. Similar to the 1953 event, the strong wind in the west \nsector of storm cells (anti-cyclones) can generate waves along shore of the East Coast.  \n \nFor the South and Southwest Coast, 48 storm tracks were obtained from the synoptic \ncharts. As shown in Figure 5, most storms are concentrated in a corridor along the 55oN \nparallel. Thus, the principal pathway travelled eastwards into the English Channel or the \nBristol Channel, as indicated by the arrow. As suggested by the 1981 event (Figure 2), \nthis pathway is associated with storms that propel tidal surges onto the South and \nSouthwest Coasts and generate strong onshore winds. \n \nThe low number of floods on the West Coast between 1910 and 1950 was probably \nassociated with the fact that only 18 storms were recorded. Their frequencies in each \ngrid are shown in Figure 6. It is noticeable that they are concentrated along the 60oN \nparallel. Thus, the principal pathway can be easily defined, and is indicated by the arrow. \nThe storm track of the 1977 event falls precisely within this pathway. \n \n 11\nAdding all three pathways together, it becomes clear that floods in each coastal sector \nare associated with storms with distinctive pathways. Each pathway has its unique \ncombined affects such as tidal surge and onshore waves on the associated coast, hence \nthe risk of flooding. As mentioned earlier, the blocking effect of the Scandinavian \nhigh-pressure system may play a role in diverting storm cells from travelling \neastwards into or across the North Sea. The NAO indexes constructed by Hurrell \n(1995) reflect the winter surface pressure gradient between Lisbon (Portugal) and \nStykkisholmur (Iceland), which may carry little information of pressure gradient \nbetween Scandinavia and the British Isles. The variability of the Scandinavian high-\npressure system must therefore be established in order statistically verify to the spatial \nmodel of the three storm pathways.  \n \n7. Discussion and Conclusion \nCoastal flood hazard is a complex phenomenon involving a number of variables such \nas climate change, coastal type and evolution, and human activities. Instrumental \nrecords are increasingly accurate but short in time span and discontinuous. \nDocumentary records do not contain numerical details of each flood event, but are \naccurate in terms of occurrence and location of flood hazard. Thus, they provide an \nimportant complement to instrumental records since documentary records cover much \nlonger time spans and are useful as a corollary to studies of regional and global \nclimate change (Cesar 1991, Reading 1990, Subbaramayya and Mohana 1984). Much \nlonger records of flood hazard can be obtained from stratigraphic sequences (Tooley \net al., 1997; Zong and Tooley 1999). \n \nAmong the three coastal sectors, the East Coast has been mostly prone to flood \nhazards (Figures 3 and 4). The vulnerability of the East Coast to flood is also high due \nto the fact that the low-lying coastal lowland has been reclaimed extensively for \nagricultural and industrial production and settlements. Such a combination has made \nthe East Coast at high risk to coastal flood. Similarly, the high number of flood \nincidents on the South and Southwest Coast (Figure 3) and the recent rapid \ndevelopment of coastal settlements have put this coastal sector at high risk. Due to the \nlower frequencies of flood hazard and lower level of development, the risk to the \nWest Coast is less than the other two coastal sectors. \n \n 12\nThe frequencies of flood incidents recorded from the three coastal sectors are to a \ncertain extent related to climate variability. However, in this paper, only storms that \nwere related to flood events have been examined and not the record of all storms. \nFuture research, therefore, may need to examine statistically the changes in storm \nfrequency in relation to climate variables. The increased number of flood incidents on \nthe South Coast suggests that the number of storms travelling along a southern \npathway (Figure 5) may have increased during the 20th century. \n \nMany studies indicate the link between climatic variation and the strength of storms \n(Emmanuel 1987, Lamb 1985, 1991, Raper 1993, Wendland 1977), and show \nsignificant changes in UK climate (Briffa et al., 1990, Coker et al., 1980) and over \nnorth Atlantic ocean (Deser and Blackmon 1993; Kushnir 1994; Rogers 1985). \nStudies also imply the relations of North Atlantic Oscillations to the strength of \nwesterlies, which is indirectly associated with storm pathways (Hurrell 1995; Wilby et \nal. 1997). However, the pressure gradients between Scandinavia and the British Isles \nneed to be understood in order for the proposed model of three storm pathways to be \nverified.  \n \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThis research is partly funded by the National Radiological Protection Board, Chilton, \nDidcot, Oxon, UK (Contract No. 90290000).
