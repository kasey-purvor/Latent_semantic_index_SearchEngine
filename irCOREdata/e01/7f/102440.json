The \napplication d sagllite remote sensing has led to the \ntremendous growth in fhe tnasmission and storage of digits\u20ac \nimages. The needs for efficient methods e f  data compression \nbecome more i d  more important. For the past ten y e m  or \nsq the resolutions of remote sensing satellites have increased \nsignificantly &at made data compression even more \nnecessary. In general, s&&e images contain less \nredundancy idormation compared to normal images. It is \ntherefore not easy to \nquantizatbn [VQ) h \nand image signa1 prmessing applications. However, the \nunde&&le blocking effects of VQ decoded images tend to \nlimit the application of- VQ coding in satellite image \ncompression. \nThe statistical features of an image will influence the \noverall performance of vector quantization. Many image \ncompression schemes incorporate a combination of \northogonal transforms such as DCT or FFT, and vector \nquantization of the transform coefficients based on an \noptimum codebook design. Nevertheless, the statistical \nfeatures of an image are other important factors that could \naffect the efficiency of the codebook, as well as the quality of \nthe reconstructed images. \nRecently, the subject of \u201cWavelet analysis\u201d has attracted \nmuch attention from both mathematicians and engineers \nalike. Wavelet theory has been applied in many fields and \napplications, such as image analysis, communication systems, \nbiomedical imaging, radar, and control systems. With \nwavelet transforms, the original image is first decomposed at \ndifferent scales or sub-bands. This transformation also \nchanges the statistical features of the image and in turn, could \nimprove the performance of vector quantization. \nWAVELET PRSENTATION OF IMAGE \nWavelet transform is an orthogonal (or bi-orthogonal) \ntransform. Compared to a normal FFT or DCT orthogonal \ntransform, wavelet transform is a new time-frequency two- \ndimension signal ana\u20acysis method. Haar described the fvst \nwavelet basis in 1910 known now as the Haar wavelet basis. \nHowever, this wavelet does not form a continuous basis. In \nthe 1980s, researchers such as Coheb, Coihan, \nDaubechiesr4], Mallat[*] and Meyer performed a lot of \npioneering work in wavelets, especially in multi-resolution \nand fast wavelet transforms. As a result, wavelet transform \nbegan to find more and more applications in digital signal \nand image processing. \nAlthough the theoretical basis of orthogonal analysis is \nvery sound, it is not simple to derive an orthogonal wavelet \nbasis. Normally, the basis of orthogonal wavelet transform is \nneither compact support nor continuous. This means it is not \na straightforward task to design linear FIR filters based on \northogonal wavelets. Moreover, the application of wavelet \ntransforms in image processing requires linear phase FIR \nfilters. Implementation of FIR filters is based on the use of \nbi-orthogonal wavelet. Bi-orthogonal wavelets are based on \ntwo multi-resolution analyses: {V,}, {W,} and {v,} , { f m }  . \nThey satisfy the following conditions: \nV,L@,, FmlWm \nAnd their Z-transforms satisfy[*] : \nI H ( z )  II &) I + I H ( - z )  II fiC-4 I = 1 (I z I= 1) \nYu et a1 ['I have designed several kinds of wavelets and \nFIR filters through B-splines. These filter banks all have the \nfollowing important characteristics: \n0 Satisfy bi-wavelet analysis conditions; \n0 \nHigh efficiency; \nLinear phase; \n0 \nBases are compact support and continuous; \nSignal can be reconstructed exactly. \nN \nFFT \nDCT \nA. Computation \nCompared to FFT and DCT, the computation of wavelet \ntransform does not depend on the size of the signal. Now let \nus compare the computation of the different transforms. \n0 \n0 \nIt is known thatL5] :\nN-point FFT requires N log, N complex multiplications. \nN-point DCT requires' (N logz N - N + 2) \/ 4 complex \nmultiplications. \nFor wavelet transforms, the formula would be quite \ndifferent, as its computation is not dependent on the number \nof points. For m=2 and m'=2 bi-orthogonal wavelet \ntransforms, its average computation is 2.5 real multi- \nplications. But if all the parameters of FIR are considered to \nbe the power of (1\/2), then multiplications can be converted \nto bit shift if performed on a computer or a DSP chip. This bit \nshift operation leads to a fast bi-orthogonal wavelet \ntransform. Its average computation is 1 real multiplication \nand 2.5 real additions, as presented in tablel. \n4 8 16 32 \n32 96 256 640 \n6 18 50 130 \nWL \nFWL \n10 20 40 80 \n4 8 16 32 \nConsider the different values of N in Table 1, which lists \nthe computation efficiency of FFT, DCT and Wavelet, high \nefficiency can be obtained by the Fast Wavelet Transform \nwith N > 8. With increasing N, the advantage of higher \nefficiency for the fast wavelet transform becomes more and \nmore apparent. \nWavelet transform is thus a high efficiency and low \ncomputationally intensive method for transforming a signal in \nthe time domain to the time-frequency domain. Its \ncomputation is much lower than the FFT or DCT. The key \nadvantage of the wavelet transform is that its number of \ncomputations per point remains constant. This means that the \nentire signal may be wavelet transformed without the need \nuse sub-blocks to reduce computation effort, as would be \nrequired for the FFT or DCT transform, resulting in blocking \neffects. \nB. Statistical Features \nA wavelet transform will modify the statistical features of \na signal. Typically, a wavelet transform includes a filter pair: \na high-pass filter and a low-pass filter. In this paper, the bi- \northogonal wavelet FIR filter is used for image \ntransformation. The initial iteration of the bi-orthogonal \nwavelet FIR filter will act on the satellite test image, \ndecomposing it into a coarse and three detail components. \nThe next iteration on the coarse component of the previous \niteration decomposes it further into coarse and detail \ncomponents. After N decomposition iterations, 3N detail \ncomponents and one coarse component of the original image \nare yielded. The coarse component of the decomposition can \nbe regarded as a low-pass filtered sub-image and the detail \ncomponents as the high-pass filtered sub-image of the \noriginal signal. The pixel values in these components are \nalways small and lowly correlated. \nFor vector quantization, the data statistics are very \nimportant. It is expected that the statistical features between a \ntraining image and a test image may be very similar. In \ngeneral, however, different satellite images would have \ndifferent statistical features. Therefore, it is almost impossible \nto get a common codebook to satisfy all of these images. \nDCT or FFT is often used to transform data from the time \ndomain to the frequency domain in order to get better results, \nbut the results are not satisfactory due to computation and \nblocking effects. As wavelet transform can also transform an \nimage from the time-domain into the frequency domain, it \noffers an alternative opportunity to compress an image at \ndifferent scales and sub-bands. \nLet us examine two images; figure 1 shows the statistical \nfeatures of an image of a city scene and the detail \ncomponents after wavelet transform; figure 2 shows the \ncorresponding image of a lake scene. The statistics of these \nimages are very different. But after wavelet transform, their \ndetail components become very similar. \nSATELLITE IMAGE COMPRESSION \nAfter a wavelet transform, the statistics of an image \nwould be changed. Applying several iterations of a high-pass \nwavelet filter would cause the pixel values of the detail \ncomponents to become smaller and less dependent on the \noriginal image, benefiting the vector quantization process. On \nthe other hand, the coarse component becomes highly \ncorrelated and is not easy to quantize. \nVector Quantization is a good method to compress images \nto very low bit rates. The principal objective of any digital \nimage compression technique is to reduce the number of bits \nrequired to represent an image, while maintaining acceptable \nimage quality. The block size for vector quantization and the \nsize of codebook are the two important parameters that have \na major influence on the quality of vector quantization. If the \nblock size increases, a higher compression ratio can be \n1172 \n~ ~ \n~ ~ \nobtained for certain YBct0x-s of some images. For-ofier \nimages, the quality of vectors would be somewhat poorer. In \nthis paper, after compaciug the results of different sizes-& \nvectors and codebooks, a vector size of 32 by 32 and a \ncodebook of size 128 were chosen. For the coarse \ncomponent, the ADPCM methed was used. The wavelet \ntransform was applied only once in each of the two \ndimensions to generate one warse component and three \ndetail components. Followed by vector quant5zation on the \ndetail components and ADPCM m the coarse component. A \nrecon- image with PSNR= 28.65dB was subsequently \nobtained. To test the qm&y of the codebook, two different \nimages were used. One is a lake scene aad the other is a \nmountain scene. n e  cdebook obtained through the cify \nscene was used, the reconstructed images of these two scenes \nwere reasonable good, with PSNR=28.34dB and 3\u20ac.73&3, \nrspecltively . \nCONCLUSfON \nThe effects of bi- ogonak wavelet FIR filter on the \nstatistical fe\u2019eantres of satellite images were studied and \nevaluated. The computation efficiency of bi-orthogonal \nwavelet wrtsaeS0 analyzed in detail. The result proves that the \nbi-orthogonal wavelet FIR filter pair can be used to transform \nan image &an the time domain into the time-kequency \ndomain with low computsltional overheads. Using bi- \northogonal wavelets can improve the matching of vector \nquantization elements to the image data values.
