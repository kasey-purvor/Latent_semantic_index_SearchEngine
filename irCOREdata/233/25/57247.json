The structure of the crust is consistent24\nwith petrological models indicating that fractionation is the dominant process25\nproducing andesite at Montserrat.26\n27\nIntroduction27\nThe composition of arc crust is a fundamental issue in earth sciences. Seismic surveys28\nsuggest that arcs are significantly thicker than oceanic crust, with inferred29\ncompositions more mafic than continental crust (e.g. Christensen and Mooney, 1995).30\nMost of our knowledge derives from seismic surveys, exhumed crustal sections and31\ncrustal xenoliths. Here igneous xenoliths sampled from andesite lavas on Montserrat32\nare described and used, together with petrological information, to help interpret33\nseismic velocity data obtained from the SEA CALIPSO project. Together these data34\nconstrain the crustal structure beneath Montserrat.35\n36\nBackground37\nMontserrat is located in the Lesser Antilles island arc related to subduction of the38\nAtlantic plate beneath the Caribbean plate. Arc volcanism has been active since the39\nCretaceous and shifted westward during the Miocene, producing a double island40\nchain. Early seismic surveys determined an average crustal thickness in the Lesser41\nAntilles of ~30km, with a heterogeneous upper crust (Vp=6.2km\/s) of variable42\nthickness, and a higher velocity lower crust (Vp=6.9km\/s, Westbrook and McCann,43\n1986; and references therein). However Christeson et al. (2008) reported an average44\ncrustal thickness of 24km.45\n46\nThe four volcanic centres of Montserrat date back to 2.6Ma (Harford et al., 2002).47\nThe current eruption of Soufri\u00e8re Hills Volcano (SHV) began in 1995, characterised48\nby phases of dome growth and collapse. Deposits include andesitic domes and49\npyroclastic, lahar and debris avalanche deposits. Andesite is the dominant rock type.50\nEvidence from deformation studies (Mattioli et al., 1998) and melt inclusions (Devine51\net al., 1998) indicate a magma chamber at 5-6km depth beneath the SHV. A deeper52\nchamber (~12km) has been inferred from deformation modelling combined with53\nmagma extrusion volumes (Elsworth et al., 2008). Mafic magmatic inclusions in the54\nhost andesite suggest repeated input of basalt and basaltic andesite magma55\naccompanied by reheating (e.g. Sparks et al., 1998; Murphy et al., 1998).56\n57\nMethodology58\nCrustal xenoliths were collected from all four volcanic centres. Modal mineral59\nproportions were obtained for a representative selection of xenoliths, host andesite60\nand mafic magmatic inclusions by point counting using a petrographic microscope.61\nMineral phases were analysed for major elements using the Cameca SX100 electron62\nmicroprobe at Bristol University with a 20kV accelerating voltage and 10nA beam63\ncurrent. Textures were analysed using a petrological microscope and the Scanning64\nElectron Microscope (SEM).65\n66\nThe seismic velocity of a rock can be estimated from modal proportions and elastic67\nproperties of individual minerals, assuming isotropic fabrics, using the following68\nequation:69\nM* = viMi( )t\ni=1\nn\n\u0003\n\u0004\n\u0005\n\u0006\n\u0007\n\b\n\t\n1\nt\n70\n71\nwhere M* is the bulk or shear modulus of the composite; vi is the volumetric72\nproportion of the ith mineral; and Mi is the bulk or shear modulus of the ith mineral.73\nThe Voigt average (MV) assumes uniform strain (t=1) and the Ruess average (MR)74\nassumes uniform stress (t=-1) throughout the polymineralic rock (Watt et al., 1976,75\nand references therein). These averaging schemes effectively provide upper and lower76\nbounds, therefore the arithmetic mean (MV+MR)\/2, or the \u2018Hill average\u2019, is commonly77\nused (Watt et al., 1976). Unless stated otherwise, quoted velocities have been78\ncalculated using the arithmetic mean. Elastic constants were taken from the79\ncompilation of Hacker and Abers (2004; and references therein). Average mineral80\ncompositions from electron probe analyses were used to extrapolate between end-81\nmember elastic constants, except for plagioclase (Angel et al., 2004). The effect of82\nporosity on seismic velocities can be estimated using the equation below (Wyllie et83\nal., 1958):84\n85\n1\nV\n=\n\u0004\nVf\n+\n1\u0002 \u0003\nVm\n86\n87\nwhere \u0003 is fractional porosity, Vf and Vm are the seismic velocities of the pore fluid88\nand the rock matrix respectively.89\n90\nBulk rock temperature and pressure corrections of -0.0005 km\/s \u00b0C\n-1\n(Christensen,91\n1979) and 0.006 s (Rudnick and Fountain, 1995) respectively were used. Velocities92\nwere modelled based on a normal arc geothermal gradient of 30 \u00b0C\/km. Calculated93\nvelocity gradients of most rock types compare well to estimates based on temperature94\nand pressure derivatives of individual mineral elastic constants (Hacker and Abers,95\n2004), with a maximum discrepancy of 0.09 km\/s at 20km depth.96\n97\nResults and Discussion98\n99\nXenoliths100\nMost xenoliths are intrusive igneous rocks. They can be classified as: noritic101\nanorthosites, gabbroic anorthosites, and hornblende-gabbros. Other less common102\nxenoliths include: quartz diorite, metamorphosed biotite-gabbro, and nearly pure (80-103\n86%) monomineralic rocks including: plagioclase-hornblendite and plagioclase-104\nclinopyroxenite. Xenolith modal mineralogy is characterised by varying proportions105\nof plagioclase, amphibole, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, titanomagnetite, ilmenite106\nand quartz, similar to mineral assemblages in the host andesite (Table 1). Montserrat107\nxenoliths have similar mineral assemblages to xenoliths found throughout the Lesser108\nAntilles (Arculus and Wills, 1980), apart from the absence of olivine.109\n110\nThe xenoliths are mostly unlayered and isotropic. Sharp contacts with the host111\nandesite and absence of chilled margins suggest the xenoliths were largely or entirely112\nconsolidated prior to entrainment, in contrast to the mafic magmatic inclusions113\n(Figure 1). Many of the xenoliths have orthocumulate textures with vesiculated114\ngroundmasses (<26vol%) and abundant plagioclase microlites, similar to xenoliths115\nfrom other Antilles islands (Arculus and Wills, 1980). This indicates the presence of116\npartially quench crystallized interstitial melt (<42%). Miarolitic cavities partially117\ninfilled with secondary cristobalite together with the fine-medium grain size indicate118\nthat most xenoliths crystallised in hypabyssal intrusions. Some samples display119\nadcumulate and crescumulate textures. One sample consists of alternating pyroxene-120\nanorthosite and plagioclase-clinopyroxenite layers, with crescumulate textures normal121\nto the mineral layering. Such textures are interpreted as rapid crystal growth from a122\nsupercooled melt at the margins of a magma body (e.g. Donaldson, 1977).123\n124\nPlagioclase compositions of most xenoliths (An46-91) show similar variation to the125\nhost andesite and mafic inclusions (Murphy et al., 1998). Crystals display normal,126\nreverse and oscillatory zoning consistent with repeated injections of mafic magma, as127\ninterpreted for the host andesite (e.g. Sparks et al., 1998; Murphy et al., 1998). Sodic128\nplagioclase microlites (An20-37) are consistent with crystallisation from a late-stage129\nmelt.130\n131\nMafic phases include clinopyroxene (En37-40Wo38-45) \u00b1orthopyroxene (En54-60Wo2-4)132\n\u00b1magnesio-hornblende (Leake et al., 1997). No significant core-rim variations are133\nobserved in a majority of the xenoliths. Hornblende typically contains 6.3-8.8wt%134\nAl2O3, with magnesium numbers of 58-64, a similar range to the host andesite135\n(Murphy et al., 1998). A few xenoliths have more Al-rich hornblende similar to the136\nmafic inclusions (<14wt% Al2O3; Murphy et al., 1998). Similar mineral compositions137\nof most xenoliths to the host andesite suggest they are cognate (or there is a primary138\nmagmatic relationship). The lack of suitable mineral assemblages has hindered139\nestimates of xenolith equilibration pressures.140\n141\nHornblende from plagioclase-hornblendite has significantly higher magnesium142\nnumbers of 70-76. The layered sample is compositionally distinct, with highly calcic143\nplagioclase (An79-87) and a small proportion of more magnesium-rich orthopyroxene144\n(En65-67). Sodic plagioclase rims (An36-64) and Fe-rich orthopyroxene rims (En46-52) are145\npresent in the pyroxene-anorthosite layer. This sample is interpreted as crystallization146\nat the margins of a mafic magma body, with rim compositions indicative of147\ninfiltration of the crystal mush by more evolved melts.148\n149\nVelocity estimates150\nVelocity estimates of the xenoliths are very similar despite the range of mineral151\nassemblages (Figure 2). Velocity of most xenoliths calculated from their primary152\nmodal mineralogy show good correlation with laboratory measurements of similar153\nrocks (Table 1; Christensen and Mooney, 1995). However calculated velocities of the154\nandesite and mafic magmatic inclusions are significantly higher. Alteration minerals155\nand a small proportion of glass observed in these rocks may produce some of this156\nvariation.157\n158\nVelocities have been calculated based on three scenarios: (1) no vesicles, assuming159\nthat vesicles are only abundant in the shallow crust; (2) all vesicles are filled with160\nwater; and (3) all vesicles are filled with secondary quartz, based on observed161\ncristobalite (Figure 2). Water-saturated vesicles dramatically reduce seismic velocity162\nestimates by up to 2.9 km\/s for the highly vesicular samples. Secondary quartz163\nreduces velocities by <0.3 km\/s.164\n165\nSEA CALIPSO results166\nThe upper crust beneath Montserrat is considered to consist largely of andesite based167\non surface geology and our new observations of xenoliths formed in shallow168\nintrusions. An intrusive complex could explain the high velocity core beneath the169\nisland imaged by the SEA CALIPSO project (Paulatto et al., in press; Shalev et al.,170\nthis issue). The calculated seismic velocity of andesite is much higher pore-free than171\nobserved velocities, indicating that porosity is an important control of velocity in the172\nuppermost crust (0-5km). Field observations indicate that volcaniclastic rocks likely173\ndominate the near\u2013surface, with primary and secondary porosity from vesicles and174\ninter-particle spaces. At the greatest resolvable depth (~8km; Paulatto et al., in press)175\nseismic tomography results are lower than all calculated pore-free velocities.176\n177\nSevilla et al. (subjudice) have produced a receiver function profile that resolves the178\nMoho at ~30km depth. A mid-crustal layer ~1km thick with velocities of 6.0-6.7 km\/s179\nis consistent with measured (Christensen and Mooney, 1995) and calculated velocities180\nof quartz diorite. Lower crustal velocities of 6.7-7.0 km\/s (Sevilla et al., subjudice)181\nmatch estimated velocities of plagioclase-hornblendite and basaltic to basaltic182\nandesite mafic inclusions, and measured velocities of gabbro, norite, anorthosite and183\nhornblendite (Figure 3; Christensen and Mooney, 1995). Relict oceanic crust may also184\nbe present in the lower crust.185\n186\nConstraints from petrology187\nSeveral igneous processes can lead to layering of island arc crust, including partial188\nmelting of older crust and crystallisation of basalt, together with segregation of189\nresidual evolved melts. These scenarios produce physically similar layering with more190\ndifferentiated magma supplied to the upper crust leaving denser more mafic191\ncumulates or restite in the lower crust (Annen et al., 2006). Thus it is difficult to192\ndistinguish between these processes from seismic velocity data alone.193\n194\nMagmatic parents to the andesite magma could be represented by the mafic inclusions195\nor the South Soufri\u00e8re Hills basaltic andesite. Zellmer et al. (2003) calculated that the196\nmost evolved mafic inclusion could be produced from the least evolved mafic197\ninclusion by fractional crystallisation of 49% amphibole and 21% plagioclase. A198\nfurther ~10% crystallisation is necessary to produce the Th concentration of the most199\nevolved andesite. The andesite can also be modelled by 65% crystallisation of200\nplagioclase and amphibole from the least evolved South Soufri\u00e8re Hills lava (Zellmer201\net al., 2003).202\n203\nFractionation models (Zellmer et al., 2003) thus imply that an andesitic upper crust204\nshould be complemented by cumulates of plagioclase and amphibole in the lower205\ncrust. Upper\/middle crust interpreted from the receiver function profile (Sevilla et al.,206\nsubjudice) is ~10km thick to the island surface, and lower crust is ~21km thick. The207\nratio of upper to lower crust is therefore 1:2. This is consistent with the 65% South208\nSoufri\u00e8re Hills fractionation model (Zellmer et al., 2003). Without a 3D velocity209\nstructure we cannot account for the lateral extent of crustal layers. Assuming the210\nlower crust dominantly comprises plagioclase and amphibole, observed seismic211\nvelocities (Sevilla et al., subjudice) correspond to 30-80% hornblende and212\ncorresponding plagioclase. These fractionation models are based on a parental magma213\nthat is evolved with respect to primitive melts. Therefore additional cumulates of214\npyroxene, olivine and plagioclase are either present in the lower crust or beneath the215\npetrological Moho, noting that the velocities of these ultramafic cumulates could be216\n>7.7 km\/s.217\n218\nSome evidence indicates that the andesite is at least partially produced by anatexis.219\nStable isotope ratios of amphiboles (Harford and Sparks, 2001) and bulk U\/Th ratios220\nindicate partial melting and remobilisation of previous intrusions (Zellmer et al.,221\n2003). Tatsumi et al. (2008) suggest that ~30% melting of basaltic crust could222\nproduce andesitic magma. This would produce a middle to lower crust ratio of 1:2223\nalso similar to the observed crustal structure. Oxygen isotopes are consistent with a224\ncontribution of 10-20% hydrothermally altered crust. However trace element225\nconcentrations can largely be modelled by fractional crystallisation (Zellmer et al.,226\n2003). The presence of cumulate textured xenoliths, together with petrological and227\ngeochemical evidence, favours a dominant role of intrusion and fractionation of228\nincremental additions of basalt in the model of arc crust formation at Montserrat.229\n230\nConclusion231\nIgneous xenoliths are present in the host lavas at Montserrat, with cumulate and232\nhypabyssal textures. Most have mineral assemblages and mineral compositions233\nindicating that they represent hypabyssal intrusive equivalents of the andesite, or234\ncumulate rocks formed by fractionation of basaltic andesite and andesite. The235\npresence of partially infilled vesicles in most xenoliths indicates shallow236\ncrystallisation. Surface geology and seismic velocities (Paulatto et al., in press) are237\nmost consistent with an upper crust composed of andesitic volcanic and related238\nintrusive rocks. The xenoliths and fast velocity regions beneath the volcanic centres of239\nMontserrat (Paulatto et al., in press; Shalev et al., this issue) support the interpretation240\nof intrusive complexes. Petrological models (Zellmer et al., 2003) suggest the lower241\ncrust contains cumulate rocks dominated by amphibole and plagioclase, which is242\nconsistent with seismic velocities (Sevilla et al., subjudice). The proportion of upper243\nintermediate crust to cumulate or restitic lower crust indicates that andesite has been244\nproduced by fractionation of the South Soufri\u00e8re Hills lava (Zellmer et al., 2003) or245\npartial melting of an initial basaltic crust (Tatsumi et al., 2008). A model of arc crust246\nformation largely by fractionation is consistent with xenoliths, petrology and the SEA247\nCALIPSO seismic velocity data.248\n249\nAcknowledgements250\nThis work is funded by the Natural Environment Research Council and the British251\nGeological Survey.
