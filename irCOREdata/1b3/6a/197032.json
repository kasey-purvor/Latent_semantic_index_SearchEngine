These relationships were derived using a series of Arabidopsis \nchloroplast biogenesis mutants that exhibit chlorophyll deficiencies of varying severity, and \nwere verified by the subsequent analysis of senescent or light-stressed leaves. Our results \nrevealed that the converted SPAD values differ from photometric measurements of solvent-\nextracted chlorophyll by just ~6% on average.  \n \n \nKeywords \n \nArabidopsis; Calibration curve; Chlorophyll content; Chloroplast development; SPAD meter\nLing et al., page 3 of 13 \nIntroduction \n \nLeaf chlorophyll concentration is an important parameter that is frequently measured as an \nindicator of chloroplast development, photosynthetic capacity, leaf nitrogen content, or \ngeneral plant health. In the laboratory, it is commonly determined photometrically following \nextraction of the pigments using an organic solvent, such as acetone or dimethyl formamide \n(Arnon 1949; Porra et al. 1989). While this method is well-established and accurate, it is time-\nconsuming, destructive (the leaf material must be excised from the plant, and is lost), and \nnecessitates the use of toxic or flammable chemicals. The SPAD-502 meter (Konica-Minolta, \nJapan) provides an alternative method for the measurement of relative leaf chlorophyll levels \nthat overcomes these disadvantages. It is an inexpensive, hand-held device based on two \nlight-emitting diodes and a silicon photodiode receptor, that measures leaf transmittance in the \nred (650 nm; the measuring wavelength) and infrared (940 nm; a reference wavelength used \nto adjust for non-specific differences between samples) regions of the electromagnetic \nspectrum. These transmittance values are used by the device to derive a relative SPAD meter \nvalue (typically between 0.0 and 50.0) that is proportional to amount of chlorophyll in the \nsample (Uddling et al. 2007). The meter has been used extensively in both research and \nagricultural settings, and there are many publications in the scientific literature that describe \nits use. \n In order to convert relative SPAD meter values into units of absolute chlorophyll \nconcentration, it is necessary to employ a calibration curve (Markwell et al. 1995). The \nrelationship between SPAD values and chlorophyll concentration has been investigated in a \nvariety of different species, and has been found to display considerable interspecific variation \n(Castelli et al. 1996; Uddling et al. 2007). This variability is presumed to be due to structural \ndifferences between the leaves of different species, causing different light reflection or \nscattering effects. Thus, in order for the SPAD-502 meter to be used to record real chlorophyll \nconcentration values with reasonable accuracy, a calibration equation must be derived \nspecifically for the particular species of interest (Richardson et al. 2002). Arabidopsis \nthaliana has been widely adopted across the globe as a model organism for studies on plant \ndevelopment, cellular and molecular biology, and biochemistry. The particular advantages of \nthis species are well documented, and include its completely-sequenced genome, diminutive \nstature, and rapid generation time, as well as the availability of extensive collections of \ninsertional mutants such that it is possible to quickly identify a knockout for almost any gene \nLing et al., page 4 of 13 \nof interest. As a result, a considerable proportion of the chloroplast and plastid research that is \nundertaken today is conducted using the Arabidopsis model system (Leister 2003; L\u00f3pez-Juez \n2007; Sakamoto et al. 2008). Nonetheless, only a very small number of Arabidopsis studies \nhave employed the SPAD-502 meter, and these have either presented the data in unconverted \narbitrary units (Stettler et al. 2009) or utilized a crude scaling factor to estimate actual \nchlorophyll content (Takami et al. 2010). To enable the advantages of the SPAD meter to be \nexploited more fully in the field of Arabidopsis research, we have derived specific calibration \nrelationships that can be used to convert SPAD values accurately into absolute chlorophyll \nconcentration values, on either a per-leaf-area or a per-fresh-weight basis. \n \n \nMaterials and methods \n \nPlant material and growth conditions \n \nAll plants used in this study were Arabidopsis thaliana of the Columbia-0 ecotype. The \n+\/tic110-1, hsp93-V-1, tic40-4, ppi1-1 and hsp93-V-1 hsp93-III-1 (hsp93-V\/III) mutants \nemployed to derive the calibration relationships have all been described previously (Jarvis et \nal. 1998; Kovacheva et al. 2005; Kovacheva et al. 2007). Similarly, the pph-1 and pao1 \nmutants have been presented in earlier reports (Pruzinska et al. 2005; Schelbert et al. 2009). \n Plants were germinated on MS medium and allowed to grow for 10 days for prior to \ntransferral to soil, or sown on soil directly. They were grown in ~100 \u03bcmol\/m2\/s white light \nunder a long-day cycle (16-hours-light\/8-hours-dark), as described previously (Aronsson and \nJarvis 2002). \n \n \nDark and light-stress treatments \n \nDark treatments for the induction of senescence were conducted using two different methods, \nas described previously (Pruzinska et al. 2005; Schelbert et al. 2009). In the first method (Fig. \n2), developmentally-equivalent leaves were detached from a plant and placed on wet filter \npaper in sealed Petri dishes. The dishes were then placed in a dark container within a growth \ncabinet for six days. In the second method (Fig. 3), the leaves were carefully wrapped in \nLing et al., page 5 of 13 \naluminium foil whilst still attached to the plant, and then left under standard growth \nconditions for 4-6 days. \n Light stress treatments involved exposure of 21-day-old plants grown under standard \nconditions to high-intensity white light (~2000 \u03bcmol\/m2\/s), delivered through a chilled-water \nheat sink, for three hours per day for seven days. After the final period of high-light treatment, \nthe plants were returned to standard growth conditions for 24 hours prior to conducting the \nmeasurements. \n \n \nChlorophyll measurements and data analysis \n \nAbsolute chlorophyll concentration measurements were conducted using a spectrophotometer \nand dimethyl formamide extracts of leaf tissue, as described previously (Constan et al. 2004; \nPorra et al. 1989). Leaf tissue for these measurements was harvested using a circular punch \n(cork borer) that yields 0.5 cm diameter leaf discs that are 0.19635 cm\n2\n in area; excised discs \nwere also weighed, enabling the chlorophyll data to be expressed in relation to fresh weight as \nwell as leaf area. Each solvent extract contained several leaf discs from multiple different \nplants per genotype or treatment. SPAD values were recorded using exactly the same leaves \nfrom the same plants, prior to sampling, using a SPAD-502 meter (Konica-Minolta, Japan). \nTwelve independent SPAD measurements were made per genotype or treatment, using several \ndifferent plants. \n Relationships between the two datasets were analysed using both SigmaPlot (SPSS \nScience Inc.) and Excel (Microsoft) software. Several models were tested and the two \npackages gave identical results, indicating that second-order polynomial functions provide the \nbest fit. \n \n \nResults and discussion \n \nIn order to derive useful relationships between SPAD meter readings and chlorophyll content, \nit is necessary to study plants that have a variety of different pigmentation levels. To this end, \nwe exploited a range of well-characterized chloroplast biogenesis mutants that are defective in \nthe import of proteins into plastids (Jarvis 2008). The selected mutant genotypes (+\/tic110, \nLing et al., page 6 of 13 \nhsp93-V, tic40, ppi1 and hsp93-V\/III) exhibit varying degrees of chlorosis due to variations in \nthe importance of the affected genes (Fig. 1a), and were analysed alongside wild-type plants \nof two different ages. All of the plants were used contemporaneously to make both SPAD \nmeter readings and photometric measurements using pigment extracts. By plotting these two \ndatasets against each other, we assessed possible relationships between them. While linear and \nexponential relationships between SPAD values and chlorophyll concentrations have \npreviously been proposed (Uddling et al. 2007), we observed a much stronger fit using \nsecond-order polynomial functions (Fig. 1, b and c); R\n2\n values for linear and exponential \nrelationships were, respectively, 0.979 and 0.973 for the data in b, and 0.959 and 0.972 for the \ndata in c, and thus significantly lower than those shown in Fig. 1 for the selected polynomial \nfunctions. Others have similarly reported that such polynomial functions best describe the \nrelationship between SPAD values and chlorophyll concentration (Hawkins et al. 2009; \nMarkwell et al. 1995). \n To test the utility of the calibration equations presented in Fig. 1, we studied plants \nexhibiting dark-induced senescence. Studying such environmentally induced chlorosis \nenabled us to assess whether the aforementioned relationships (derived based on an analysis \nof genetically induced chlorosis) would remain valid under different conditions. Two different \nmethods of dark treatment for the induction of senescence have been described in the \nliterature: the incubation of detached leaves in a dark container, and the covering of attached \nleaves with aluminium foil (Pruzinska et al. 2005; Schelbert et al. 2009). We elected to \nemploy both of these methods, starting with the former. In addition to wild type, we \nincorporated two well-characterized, senescence-defective mutants in our analysis, as \nadditional controls. These were the pheophytinase (PPH) mutant, pph, and the pheide a \noxygenase (PAO) mutant, pao1, both of which are deficient in an important step of \nchlorophyll breakdown and, therefore, express a \u201cstay-green\u201d phenotype under conditions that \nnormally induce senescence (Pruzinska et al. 2005; Schelbert et al. 2009). \n After six days in the dark, detached wild-type leaves were pale-yellow in appearance, \nwhereas pph and pao1 mutant leaves retained considerable amounts of green pigmentation \n(Fig. 2a). While the pph leaves were uniformly green, pao1 leaves had a patchy appearance \nwith both green and yellow sectors. This phenotypic difference, although not specifically \nreported previously, presumably reflects the fact that pheide a and red chlorophyll catabolites \naccumulate in pao1, but not in pph, which can cause a lesion-mimic or cell death phenotype \nin the former mutant in the light (Schelbert et al. 2009). As a result of its patchy appearance, \npao1 was deemed unsuitable for the purposes of our experiment (as it would have been \nLing et al., page 7 of 13 \ndifficult to obtain consistent measurements), and so we focused only on the wild type and pph. \nDark-treated and control (untreated) leaves were used to make both SPAD meter readings and \nphotometric measurements using pigment extracts. The SPAD data were converted to \nchlorophyll values employing the calibration equations displayed in Fig. 1, and then \ncompared with photometrically determined data. As shown in Fig. 2 (b and c), the two \ndatasets were very similar, indicating that the derived conversion formulae are suitable for the \nmeasurement of chlorophyll under different conditions. \n In relation to chlorophyll a\/b ratios, it should be noted that the meter\u2019s measuring light \nhas a peak wavelength of 650 nm, which lies approximately midway between the absorption \nmaxima of chlorophylls a and b, and in fact is the point of intersection of the absorption \nspectra of the two pigments (Arnon 1949; Porra et al. 1989). Thus, while caution is advised, \nmeasurements with the SPAD meter are unlikely to be strongly distorted by a\/b ratio changes. \nIndeed, the effect of the pph mutation is such that, under dark-treatment conditions, the \nchlorophyll a\/b ratio is dramatically reduced in the mutant relative to wild type (data not \nshown; Schelbert et al. 2009). The fact that SPAD readings taken using dark-treated pph \nplants were similar to corresponding photometric measurements (Fig. 2, b and c) supports the \nnotion that the meter is not adversely influenced by deviations in the chlorophyll a\/b ratio. \n Using the second method for the induction of senescence, we observed that most \nleaves covered for six days would dry out and die. The covering period was therefore reduced \nto four days, and under these conditions we observed the expected chlorosis in wild type, and \na \u201cstay-green\u201d phenotype in pph (Fig. 3a). However, pao1 leaves were not viable under these \nconditions either, and, as with the detached leaves (Fig. 2), this difference from pph may be \ndue the accumulation of harmful chlorophyll catabolites in the pao1 mutant (Pruzinska et al. \n2005; Schelbert et al. 2009). Importantly, analysis of chlorophyll levels in these leaves using \nthe two different methods again revealed closely correlated datasets (Fig. 3b), supporting the \nutility of the SPAD conversion formulae. \n In a final experiment to corroborate the usefulness of the calibration equations, we \nanalysed light-stressed plants simultaneously using both chlorophyll quantification methods. \nProlonged exposure to high light intensities of a plant not acclimated to such conditions leads \nto significant damage of the photosynthetic apparatus and a concomitant depletion of \nphotosynthetic pigments (Aronsson et al. 2006; Powles 1984). As expected, the light-stressed \nplants appeared paler than control plants, and somewhat stunted (Fig. 4a). Comparison of the \nconverted SPAD data with those derived photometrically from extracted pigment confirmed \nthe suitability of the formulae for assaying chlorophyll content differences induced by another, \nLing et al., page 8 of 13 \ndifferent set of conditions (Fig. 4b). Considering all of the data shown in Figs. 2, 3 and 4, it is \napparent that the values determined using the SPAD meter differ from the conventionally \nacquired data by ~6%, on average, which for most purposes should be an acceptable margin \nof error. It is noteworthy that there is a strong linear relationship between readings of the \nSPAD-502 meter, employed here, and another popular chlorophyll meter, the N-Tester (Yara, \nNorway; formerly Hydro) (Levey and Wingler 2005; Uddling et al. 2007). Thus, the \nconversion formulae derived here may also be useful in conjunction with data from that \ndevice. \n It should be noted that SPAD meter readings can be influenced by changing growth \nconditions that, for example, may lead to a redistribution of chloroplasts within mesophyll \ncells (Naus et al. 2010). For this reason, it is advisable to always include an internal control in \neach experiment, as a point of reference, and to be cautious about making comparisons \nbetween experiments conducted on different occasions. Nonetheless, provided that the plants \nto be measured are grown under the commonly-used and very standard, controlled conditions \nemployed here, the results should be reproducible. Another consideration that should be borne \nin mind is the size of the meter\u2019s measuring area, which is 2 mm \u00d7 3 mm. While this \ncompactness is an advantage in that it may accommodate all but the smallest leaves of rosette-\nstage plants, it may be disadvantageous in relation to leaves that have an excessively patchy \nor reticulate appearance (e.g., pao1; Fig. 2a). However, this problem may be at least partially \novercome by taking multiple measurements using different areas of the same leaf. \n \n \nConclusion \n \nThe formulae presented here are suitable for converting SPAD readings into values of \nchlorophyll concentration in Arabidopsis leaves, and the converted values correlate closely \nwith direct photometric measurements of extracted chlorophyll. Use of the SPAD-502 meter \nis a very quick and simple procedure, requiring no toxic or flammable solvents. Moreover, as \nthe procedure is non-destructive, this approach has significant advantages in relation to \nexperiments that require the recovery of biological material from the leaves (e.g., nucleic \nacids or protein), the analysis of particularly precious plants that can neither be sacrificed nor \ndamaged, and studies where it is desirable to monitor dynamic changes of chlorophyll content \nin the same individual throughout development or in responses to changing conditions. \nLing et al., page 9 of 13 \n \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThis work was supported by a Royal Society International Incoming Fellowship (to WH), the \nRoyal Society Rosenheim Research Fellowship (to PJ), and by Biotechnology and Biological \nSciences Research Council (BBSRC) grants BB\/D016541\/1, BB\/F020325\/1 and \nBB\/H008039\/1 (to PJ). \nLing et al., page 10 of 13 \nFigure legends \n \n \nFig. 1. Use of chloroplast biogenesis mutants to derive calibration relationships between \nSPAD meter readings and photometric chlorophyll measurements. \n(a) Arabidopsis plants of the indicated genotypes were grown side-by-side under identical \nconditions for either 35 days (wild type and all mutants) or 45 days (wild type only), and then \ntypical individuals were selected for photography. \n(b, c) Plants similar to those shown in (a) were used to make SPAD meter readings, and to \nmake direct measurements of absolute chlorophyll concentration by the photometric analysis \nof solvent extracts. The SPAD values are plotted along the x-axis, and the corresponding \nchlorophyll concentration values are plotted along the y-axis (nmol chlorophyll a+b per cm\n2\n \nleaf area in [b]; nmol chlorophyll a+b per mg leaf fresh weight in [c]). The presented data are \nmeans (\u00b1SD) derived from 12 independent SPAD meter readings done on up to 12 different \nplants, or from three independent solvent extracts (one less for tic40), each one containing \nfour leaf discs from up to four different plants.
