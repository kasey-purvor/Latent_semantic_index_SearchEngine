HF radar backscatter which has been artificially-\ninduced by a high power RF facility has been demonstrated\nto provide ionospheric electric field data of unprecedented\ntemporal resolution and accuracy. Here such data, induced\nby the SPEAR high power radar on Svalbard, are used to in-\nvestigate ULF wave processes observed by the CUTLASS\nHF radars. Observations are presented of both waves with\na large-scale nature, driven externally to the magnetosphere\nand those with small azimuthal scale lengths, driven by\nwave-particle interactions. For ULF wave events with large\nazimuthal scale lengths an excellent agreement in the ob-\nserved wave polarisation ellipse is found between the radar\nobservations and ground-based magnetometer data. In con-\ntrast, for the small scale events, no ground-based magnetic\ncounterpart is observed. Indeed the data from the two CUT-\nLASS radars seem inconsistent, and each radar must be in-\nterpreted separately, as the spatial resolution of the radars is\nsufficient to resolve the wave characteristics along the radar\nbeams, but insufficient to resolve the wave characteristics\nacross the beams. A high azimuthal wave number (m) wave\nwith a period of 300 s and m\u223c\u221260 is observed to occur over\nSvalbard at \u223c14:00 magnetic local time. This confirms the\nexistence of waves driven by wave-particle interactions with\ntrapped particle populations in the outer magnetosphere. A\ncomparison of the observed wave characteristics with pre-\nvious, lower latitude, observations suggests that these high\nlatitude waves have a similar azimuthal scale size to those\ngenerated in the inner magnetosphere; the azimuthal wave\nnumber of \u221260 observed in the present study is comparable\nto previous values of \u221220\u2013\u221250, but suggests an increase of\nm with latitude. A similar energy source in drifting proton\npopulations is also suggested, but with lower characteristic\nproton energies of 10 keV implicated at high latitude, com-\npared to the 20\u201360 keV energies invoked for previous lower\nlatitude observations.\nCorrespondence to: T.

Such high-m\nwaves are presently a topic of considerable importance in\nboth theoretical and experimental studies. Energetic particles\nentering the Earth\u2019s inner magnetosphere from the magneto-\ntail will experience gradient-curvature drift and thus move\naround the Earth, constituting part of the global ring cur-\nrent. Such drifting particles can drive MHD wave modes\nthrough wave-particle interactions, leading to perturbations\nin the electric and magnetic fields in the magnetosphere and\nionosphere when free energy is available to the wave. It\nhas been suggested (e.g. Southwood, 1976; Hughes et al.,\n1979) that the part of the ion distribution function which is\nable to feed energy into the wave is that where \u2202f\n\/\n\u2202W>0\nwhere f is the ion distribution function and W is the en-\nergy. Such non-Maxwellian ion distribution functions, of-\nten termed \u201cbump-on-tail\u201d distributions, can be created quite\ncommonly by naturally-occurring processes in the magne-\ntosphere, such as substorm-associated particle injections or\nother particle acceleration processes. Subsequent to such\nan injection the ions are subject to gradient-curvature and\nE\u2227B drifts and move westwards, arriving at a given magnetic\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n2254 T. K. Yeoman et al.: Large and small scale ULF waves\nlocal time at different universal times due to the energy de-\npendence of magnetospheric drift paths. Even under steady\nstate conditions particles follow energy-dependent drift paths\nwhich can lead to the formation of such bump-on-tail dis-\ntributions (Cowley and Ashour-Abdallah, 1976; Ozeke and\nMann, 2001). Subsequent to such an injection and drift pro-\ncess, on occasion particles will match the local drift-bounce\nresonance condition (Southwood et al., 1969),\n\u03c9wave \u2212mwave\u03c9drift = N\u03c9bounce, (1)\nwhere N is either zero (drift resonance) or an integer (usually\n\u00b11, drift bounce resonance). In either case \u03c9wave, \u03c9bounce,\nand \u03c9drift are the angular frequencies of the wave, the proton\nbounce, and the proton azimuthal drift, respectively. Such\nwave-particle interactions are processes of fundamental im-\nportance in collisionless astrophysical plasmas.\nThe ionosphere modifies the magnetospheric ULF wave\nsignature, leading to rotation and attenuation of the wave\nmagnetic signature detected on the ground (e.g. Hughes and\nSouthwood, 1976; Hughes, 1983). This attenuation of the\npulsation magnetic perturbation below the ionosphere is pro-\nportional to e\u2212kz (e.g. Hughes and Southwood, 1976) where\nk is the field perpendicular component of the wave number\nand z is the E-region height. It is thus clear that ground mag-\nnetometer data is far from optimal for the study of high-m\nULF waves, and that direct observation in the ionosphere or\nmagnetosphere is usually required. In previous work, two\ncategories of particle-driven waves have been particularly in-\ntensively studied with ground-based data: storm time pulsa-\ntions and giant \u201cPg\u201d waves, which are dusk and dawn sector\nphenomena, respectively.\nStorm time Pc5 pulsations have been seen in STARE (the\nScandinavian Twin Auroral Radar Experiment; Greenwald\net al., 1978) data (Allan et al., 1982, 1983). This instrument\nhad a spatial resolution of \u223c20 km and a temporal resolu-\ntion of 20 s. Storm time Pc5 pulsations are compressional\nwaves of high m number (m=\u221220\u2013\u221280; here negative m\nis taken to represent westward phase propagation) and fre-\nquency in the Pc5 range (1.7\u20136.7 mHz) which are associated\nwith a drift resonance source mechanism. Drift resonance\ninvolves fundamental wave modes, with the electric field\nsymmetric about the equator (i.e. an equatorial electric field\nantinode). Storm-time Pc5s are observed in the dusk sec-\ntor during magnetically disturbed intervals. Similar waves,\nbut with an equatorward phase motion, have been seen in\nSABRE (the Sweden And Britain auroral Radar Experiment;\nNielsen et al., 1983) and BARS (Bistatic Auroral Radar Sys-\ntem; McNamara et al., 1983) coherent radar systems in the\ndusk sector by Yeoman et al. (1992) and Grant et al. (1992),\nrespectively. Again a spatial resolution of\u223c20 km and a tem-\nporal resolution of 20\u201330 s was available from these instru-\nments. These previous observations of equatorward prop-\nagating waves are the most similar observations to those\nwhich will be presented here.\nThe second class of particle driven ULF waves of inter-\nest are giant \u201cPg\u201d pulsations which have been observed on\nthe ground as well as by orbiting satellites at times when\ngeomagnetic conditions are quiet. Pgs are an example of\na particle-driven ULF wave which may be studied with\nground-based magnetometers. Chisham and Orr (1991) pre-\nsented a statistical study of 34 of these events observed on\nthe EISCAT magnetometer cross network in northern Scan-\ndinavia. They found a peak in occurrence of these waves\nin the dawn\/prenoon sector and no events were observed\nin the afternoon. The average value of the azimuthal wave\nnumber was \u221226 for the 34 events. Pgs have been related\nto drift-bounce resonance mechanisms with both symmetric\n(e.g. Takahashi et al., 1992) and antisymmetric (e.g. Chisham\nand Orr, 1991) wave modes, and the wave-particle interac-\ntion responsible for their generation thus remains controver-\nsial.\nRecent results from DOPE (the DOppler Pulsation Ex-\nperiment; Wright et al., 1997) at Troms\u00f8, northern Norway\n(a system with a spatial resolution of \u223c5 km and a tempo-\nral resolution of \u223c12 s) have demonstrated the existence of\npopulations of high-m waves in both the morning and after-\nnoon sectors (Yeoman et al., 2000). In this case the morning\nsector waves were the most populous, and had m-numbers\nof order 100, high enough to screen the waves completely\nfrom ground magnetometers. The structure and occurrence\nof such particle-driven waves have been studied by a number\nof authors in the magnetosphere with in situ spacecraft data,\nfor both case studies (e.g. Hughes et al., 1979; Takahashi\net al., 1990) and statistically (e.g. Kokubun, 1985; Takahashi\net al., 1985; Anderson et al., 1990; Woch et al., 1990; En-\ngebretson et al., 1992; Lessard et al., 1999). These studies\nare largely consistent with the ground-based results, iden-\ntifying a strong population of particle-driven waves in the\ndusk sector. Events are also detected near dawn, however,\nand a variety of wave-particle interaction modes have been\ninvoked. Yeoman and Wright (2001) presented ULF wave\nobservations close to local noon using the HF radar arti-\nficial backscatter technique at Troms\u00f8 which demonstrated\nboth wave activity characteristic of drift-bounce resonance\nand wave activity characteristic of drift resonance activity,\nwith the latter waves showing equatorward phase propaga-\ntion. Previous studies, therefore, have established the impor-\ntance of ULF waves driven by wave-particle interactions in\nthe inner magnetosphere. What remains unclear is the im-\nportance of these processes at higher latitudes, where the ge-\nomagnetic field lines are often open, and the trapping of en-\nergetic particles is more difficult. In this paper, the HF radar\nartificial backscatter technique is used at the Space Plasma\nExploration by Active Radar (SPEAR, Wright et al., 2000;\nRobinson et al., 2006) system on Svalbard in order to pro-\nvide a new dataset for the study of such particle-driven ULF\nwaves at very high latitudes.\nAnn.

Details of SuperDARN are given in Greenwald\net al. (1995) and Chisham et al. (2007). Figure 1 presents\nthe beam and range locations for the 15 km range gate radar\nscan modes used in this study. For the SPEAR experiments,\na restricted scan ran on both channels of the radar, one us-\ning 45 km range gates, starting at a range of 180 km and the\nother 15 km range gates, starting at 1485 km. A frequency\nsweep mode was employed, ranging from 9.9\u201313.3 MHz, us-\ning integration times of 1 or 2 s per beam. Here data for\n\u00deykkvib\u00e6r beam 6 and Hankasalmi beam 9, which inter-\nsect over SPEAR, are presented. Previous experiments per-\nformed with the EISCAT Troms\u00f8 heating facility (Rietveld\net al., 1993) have employed a similar scan pattern. In Fig. 1\nrange gates are marked every 10th gate. For the SPEAR ex-\nperiments, the full SPEAR array was used (48\u00d72 kW trans-\nmitters), in O-mode polarisation, providing an effective ra-\ndiated power (ERP) of \u223c15 MW, between 4\u20135 MHz. The\nheater produces artificial electron density irregularities in the\nF-region ionosphere, which act as targets for the HF radars.\nThe artificial targets result in very high returned backscat-\nter power in comparison to naturally-occurring irregularities.\nThis allows a short integration time to be run on the radar,\nproviding higher time resolution than is normally available.\nData are also presented from the IMAGE (International\nMonitor for Auroral Geomagnetic Effects; L\u00fchr, 1994) mag-\nnetometer station at Longyearbyen (LYR, location 78.20\u25e6 N,\n15.82\u25e6 E geographic), which has a sampling interval of 10 s.\n3 Observations\nDuring the September\u2013October 2006 campaign of SPEAR\nhigh power operations two extended intervals of artificial\nbackscatter were observed where simultaneous, collocated\ndata were collected by both the Hankasalmi and \u00deykkvib\u00e6r\nSuperDARN radars. The first of these were observed be-\ntween 12:00\u201314:30 UT on 9 October 2006. Figure 2 presents\nlarge-scale ULF wave activity during these ionospheric mod-\nification experiments. Figure 2a shows colour-coded Han-\nkasalmi beam 9 line-of-sight velocities in the meridional di-\nrection as a function of range gate and time. Figure 2b sim-\nilarly shows colour-coded \u00deykkvib\u00e6r beam 6 line-of-sight\nazimuthal velocities. In each case positive (negative) veloc-\nities represent flow towards (away from) the radars. SPEAR\nstarted transmitting at 11:00 UT, but ionospheric conditions\nwere not conducive to artificial backscatter generation until\n12:25 UT, most probably because the F-region critical fre-\nquency, foF2, was below the SPEAR transmit frequency be-\nfore this time. SPEAR-induced artificial backscatter is ap-\nparent in both radar beams after this time, up until 13:50 UT,\nwhen it weakens in the Hankasalmi data. Larger velocities\nare observed in the \u00deykkvib\u00e6r radar data, indicating a wave\nevent dominated by the azimuthal velocity component. It is\nclear that the location of the patch of artificially-generated\nirregularities varies in time in both radars. This variation is\nthe result of varying HF propagation conditions over the 1-\n1\n2 hop , \u223c2000 km propagation path between the radars and\nSPEAR, as has been documented by Yeoman et al. (2001).\nIn order to compare appropriate range gates from each radar\nthe centre of the patches of artificial backscatter have been\nidentified, and are marked in Fig. 2a and b with a dashed\nline. Velocities from these range gates may then be directly\ncompared and combined when strong artificial backscatter\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/26\/2253\/2008\/ Ann.

A strong level\nof similarity is observed between the ionospheric flow veloc-\nities and the ground magnetometer data, particularly between\nthe east-west flows and the north-south magnetic field, where\nthe oscillation is strongest.\nThe comparison between the ionospheric flows due to the\nULF wavefield and their ground magnetic counterparts can\nbe examined further by examining the polarisation ellipse of\nthe wave in both datasets.

As with the data presented in\nFigs. 2 and 3, strong similarities may be seen in the iono-\nspheric velocity data and ground magnetic field data at, for\nexample, \u223c11:30 UT and \u223c12:20 UT. In this study we will\nconcentrate on an interval of ULF wave activity visible in\nthe line-of-sight data from both radars between 11:40 UT and\n12:20 UT. In contrast to the data presented in Figs. 2 and\n3, however, this wave activity is not apparent in the ground\nmagnetic field data, and the reasons for this will be investi-\ngated next.\nIn order to investigate this interval of ULF wave activ-\nity in more detail, a subset of the colour-coded line-of-\nsight velocities presented in Fig. 4 is shown in Fig. 5. Fig-\nure 5a presents Hankasalmi beam 9 line-of-sight velocities\nand Fig. 5b \u00deykkvib\u00e6r beam 6 line-of-sight velocities. The\ndata from the meridional beam illustrated in Fig. 5a re-\nveals that the wave has rapid equatorward phase propaga-\ntion, whereas the data from the azimuthal beam illustrated in\nFig. 5a reveals rapid westward phase propagation. As de-\nscribed in the introduction, such rapid phase variation ef-\nfectively shields the variations from the ground magnetic\nfield measurements, such that only direct ionospheric mea-\nsurements are capable of revealing the wave characteristics.\nEven in the case of such direct ionospheric measurements,\nhowever, the wave characteristics of such small-scale events\npresent a challenge. If data are examined from, for ex-\nample, adjacent azimuthally-separated beams of the Han-\nkasalmi radar, no convincing evidence is found for the az-\nimuthal phase propagation which is clearly evident from the\nazimuthally-pointing beams of the \u00deykkvib\u00e6r radar as seen\nin Fig. 5b. This discrepancy is the reason why no direct com-\nbination of the data from the two radars was attempted in\nAnn. Geophys., 26, 2253\u20132263, 2008 www.ann-geophys.net\/26\/2253\/2008\/\nT. K. Yeoman et al.: Large and small scale ULF waves 2259\nFig. 4, and its explanation requires an examination of the spa-\ntial distribution of line-of-sight velocities from both radars.\nSuch a spatial distribution of line-of-sight velocities, as\nmeasured at four representative times during the wave event\ndepicted in Fig. 5, is presented in Fig. 6 in geographic coor-\ndinates. The upper row shows data from Hankasalmi and the\nlower row data from \u00deykkvib\u00e6r. The range gates selected for\nthe beams presented in Fig. 5 are here outlined in black for\neach beam of Hankasalmi and \u00deykkvib\u00e6r. Beams 9 (Han-\nkasalmi) and beam 6 (\u00deykkvib\u00e6r) presented in Fig. 5 are la-\nbelled in Fig. 6. The time intervals presented for the data\nfrom each radar in Fig. 6 are marked with vertical dashed\nlines in the corresponding panels of Fig. 5, and are cho-\nsen to encompass a clear phase front of the wave in the\nradar backscatter, revealing equatorward phase propagation\nof the region of velocities colour-coded red (\u223c\u2212150 m s\u22121)\nand westward phase propagation of the region of veloci-\nties colour-coded yellow (\u223c+250 m s\u22121) for Hankasalmi and\n\u00deykkvib\u00e6r, respectively. The upper panels of Fig. 6 clearly\nshow the region of velocities colour-coded red migrating\ndownwards, towards lower latitudes. Similarly the lower\npanels show the region of velocities colour-coded yellow mi-\ngrating right-to-left, westwards. However, the equatorward\nmigration of the region which is apparent in the upper panels\nis not apparent in the lower panels, as a result of the geom-\netry of the radar range gates: the 15 km resolution along the\nbeam reveals the wave\u2019s structure, whereas the 113 km reso-\nlution provided by the radar beam width obscures this phase\nmotion. The converse is true in the lower panels, where the\n15 km range resolution is only available in the azimuthal di-\nrection. Thus the data from each radar look direction must be\ntreated separately, and not combined as was possible in the\nanalysis of the large scale event depicted in Figs. 2 and 3.\n4 Discussion\n4.1 Artificial backscatter observations of large-scale ULF\nwaves\nData have been presented from 9 October 2006 illustrating\nlarge-scale ULF wave phenomena as measured by backscat-\nter which has been artificially-induced in the Hankasalmi and\n\u00deykkvib\u00e6r SuperDARN radars by the SPEAR high power\nHF facility on Svalbard. This large-scale ULF wave event\ndisplayed a slow evolution of wave phase along the beams\nfrom both radars. The line-of-sight components of the radar\ndata were merged into the geographic coordinate system, al-\nlowing a direct comparison of ionospheric flows and ground\nmagnetic signatures. A good agreement was observed be-\ntween the ionospheric flows and the ground magnetic field\ndata, with the wave event being dominant in the east-west\nionospheric flows and the north-south magnetic field com-\nponents. Thus, allowing for the rotation of the ULF wave\nfield as it passed from the magnetosphere, through the iono-\n-170\n-140\n-110\n-80\n-50\n-20\n10\n40\n70\nV\nelocity (m\ns\n-1)\n1140 1150 1200 1210 1220\nUT\n140\n180\n220\n260\n300\n340\n380\n420\n460\nV\nelocity (m\ns\n-1)\nSUPERDARN PARAMETER PLOT\nSPEAR scatter: Hankasalmi & \u00deykkvib\u00e6r: vel 12 Oct 2006\n \n75.0\n75.5\n76.0\n76.5\nM\nag\nne\ntic\n L\nat\nitu\nde\n111\n112\n113\n114\n115\n116\n117\nM\nag\nne\ntic\n L\non\ngi\ntu\nde\nBeam 9\nBeam 6\nFig. 5.

Thus the utility of artificial backscatter techniques\nfor the investigation of ULF waves and similar dynamics of\nthe convection electric field has been confirmed at these long\nradar ranges.

Beam 9\nof Hankasalmi and beam 6 of \u00deykkvib\u00e6r, the beams displayed in Fig. 5, are labelled.\n4.2 Artificial backscatter observations of small-scale ULF\nwaves\nThree days later, on 12 October 2006, a similar artifi-\ncial backscatter experiment revealed the characteristics of\na small-scale ULF wave. In this case the ground mag-\nnetic signature of the wave was highly attenuated, rendering\nthe ground magnetometers ineffective in parameterising the\nwave characteristics. Even the radar backscatter data have\nto be examined with care in this case, as the spatial resolu-\ntion of the radar across the beams is insufficient to resolve\nthe phase motion of the wave. Only data from along the\nradar beams have sufficient resolution to do this, and thus\nthe data from Hankasalmi and \u00deykkvib\u00e6r have to be treated\nseparately. Treated thus, following the motion of a wave\ncrest through the fields-of-view of the radars, they reveal an\nequatorward phase propagation of \u223c0.4 km s\u22121 and a west-\nward phase propagation of \u223c0.5 km s\u22121, equivalent to an az-\nimuthal wave number, m, of \u223c\u221260. This represents the first\nobservations of ULF waves with such characteristics at the\nhigh latitudes of Svalbard.\n4.3 The origin of the small-scale ULF waves\nWhilst the observations of small scale ULF waves presented\nabove represent the first observations of waves of this type\nat such high latitude, clues as to their generation may be\ngained from considering previous, lower latitude observa-\ntions. A number of authors have reported observations of\nhigh-m wave events with equatorward phase propagation.\nWave events in data from the SABRE (the Sweden And\nBritain auroral Radar Experiment; Nielsen et al., 1983) radar\nsystem at L-shell of L\u223c5 were first reported by Waldock et al.\n(1983). These events were further examined by Tian et al.\n(1991) and Yeoman et al. (1992), and were found to have\ntypical periods of 400 s, with typical m-numbers of \u223c\u221220.\nThese events were interpreted as being the result of a drift\nresonance process, where N=0 in Eq. (1). The character-\nistics of the events then implied a wave energy source in\na magnetospheric particle population inversion (a bump-on-\ntail distribution) involving \u223c60 keV protons. The source of\nthe equatorward phase propagation was attributed by these\nauthors as the plasmapause, as the events were observed pri-\nmarily at dusk, when the plasmapause is statistically close\nto L=5. Concurrently, Grant et al. (1992) reported a similar\nset of observations from the BARS (Bistatic Auroral Radar\nSystem; McNamara et al., 1983) radar at L\u223c7.5. A similar\nenergy source was proposed for these events, but the wave\nAnn. Geophys., 26, 2253\u20132263, 2008 www.ann-geophys.net\/26\/2253\/2008\/\nT. K.

The\nplasmapause could be ruled out as a significant factor for\nthese observations, as a result of the higher latitude. More\nrecently an equatorward propagating event was observed at\nintermediate latitudes by Yeoman and Wright (2001), in an\nexperiment which employed an artificial backscatter exper-\niment using the Hankasalmi and \u00deykkvib\u00e6r radars in con-\njunction with the EISCAT heater at Troms\u00f8 at L=6.4. Again,\ndrift resonance was implicated as the wave energy source,\nbut now with 50 keV protons. Applying the same reasoning\nto the event presented in this study, taking the angular drift\nfrequency of the particles to be\n\u03c9drift = \u03c9wave\nmwave\n= 2pi\n\u03c4wavemwave\n, (2)\nwhere \u03c4wave is the wave period (i.e. taking N=0 in\nEq. 1) yields a proton angular drift frequency of\n\u223c3.5\u00d710\u22124 rads s\u22121. Applying the equations for the depen-\ndence of proton drift on particle energy as in Yeoman and\nWright (2001) then implies an energy source in 10 keV pro-\ntons at L=15. At these low energies, the drift speed due\nto gradient-curvature drift and E\u2227B drift are comparable,\nand the radar data in Fig. 4 indicate a variable ionospheric\nelectric field, so there is a significant uncertainty in the\nvalue of 10 keV. The characteristics of the ULF wave events\nwith equatorward phase propagation observed by Grant et al.\n(1992), Yeoman et al. (1992), Yeoman and Wright (2001)\nand those presented here are summarised in Table 1, along\nwith the energetic particle populations implicated in their\ngeneration by the authors concerned. Table 1 shows that\nwhilst wave events are seen with a variety of m-numbers and\nperiods, a clear trend exists in that the energy of the proposed\nparticle population inversion decreases as the L-shell of the\nobservation increases.\nIn order to verify that the proposed generation mechanism\nis realistic, it is neccessary to establish whether such pop-\nulations of energetic particles are likely to exist within the\nmagnetosphere which overlies the ionospheric wave obser-\nvations. Such a comparison has been performed at the lati-\ntudes of Troms\u00f8 by Baddeley et al. (2004), who performed a\nstatistical analysis of the local time occurrence of population\ninversions in the magnetospheric ion distribution functions\nas measured by the Polar satellite. Subsequently Baddeley\net al. (2005b) were able to demonstrate a statistically sig-\nnificant relationship between such population inversions and\nionospheric observations of high-m waves. Baddeley et al.\n(2005a) additionally provided evidence that in the pre-noon\nsector the drift-bounce resonance mechanism was statisti-\ncally more likely whereas in the post-noon sector both a drift\nor drift-bounce resonance interaction was statistically possi-\nble. The analysis of magnetospheric ion distribution func-\ntions was extended to a wider range of invariant latitudes by\nWilson et al. (2006). Figure 7 presents a subset of occurrence\ndistributions of bump-on-tail ion distribution functions taken\nfrom Wilson et al. (2006) as a function of particle energy and\nmagnetic local time as observed by the Polar CAMMICE in-\nstrument for (a) 60\u25e6\u201367\u25e6 N magnetic latitude (b) 68\u25e6\u201369\u25e6 N\nmagnetic latitude (c) 74\u25e6\u201375\u25e6 N magnetic latitude. In Fig. 7a,\nat latitudes which correspond to the wave events analysed by\nTian et al. (1991), Yeoman et al. (1992) and Yeoman and\nWright (2001), it can be seen that whilst the majority of pop-\nulation inversions occur at energies close to 5 keV, some are\nobserved at higher energies close to 50 keV. At higher lati-\ntudes, corresponding to the wave events examined by Grant\net al. (1992), Fig. 7b reveals that these higher energy popu-\nlation inversions have been lost, but population inversions at\nenergies up to 20 keV remain. At the highest latitudes, cor-\nresponding to the event presented here, Fig. 7c reveals that\nthe maximum energy of the population inversion has reduced\nfurther, with no events observed above 10 keV. Thus in each\ncase the particle populations inferred in Table 1 represent\nthe highest particle energies at which population inversions\nare observed to actually occur within the magnetosphere, but\nFig. 7 reveals that the implied particle energies can indeed\nprovide the energy source required to explain the observa-\ntions of equatorward propagating waves over the full range\nof observed latitudes. Table 1 suggests that the higher lati-\ntude waves appear to be characterised by higher m-numbers.\nGiven that at high latitudes the available particle populations\nare of low energy, and drift relatively slowly, such larger m-\nnumbers are required in order to satisfy the drift resonance\nequation, Eq. (2). Unlike the lower latitude observations, at\nSPEAR the observed wave period is comparable to the parti-\ncle bounce period at the proposed particle energies of 10 keV,\nthus some process involving particle bounce cannot be ruled\nout as a source mechanism, and conjugate spacecraft mea-\nsurements will be needed to provide a completely definitive\nanswer as to the exact generation mechanism.\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/26\/2253\/2008\/ Ann.

In the case of large-scale ULF\nwaves, an excellent agreement is found between the iono-\nspheric flow velocities and the ground magnetic field mea-\nsurements from a nearby magnetometer, once account has\nbeen taken of the 90\u25e6 rotation of the ULF wave field as\nit passes from the magnetosphere, through the ionosphere,\nto the ground. For small scale waves, the signature in the\nground magnetometer data is strongly attenuated, as previ-\nous results have suggested. The artificial backscatter tech-\nnique still provides clear measurements of the wave field in\nthis case, but at the long radar ranges at which SPEAR stimu-\nlates backscatter in the Hankasalmi and \u00deykkvib\u00e6r fields-of-\nview the data from each radar must be treated separately, as\nsufficient spatial resolution is only available along the radar\nbeam, where 15 km range gates are employed. The spatial\nresolution across the beams is \u223c113 km, some 8 times lower\nthan the resolution along the beam, and this is insufficient to\nresolve the wave characteristics.\nThe radar data have revealed a high-m ULF wave event\nwith an equatorward phase propagation of 0.4 km s\u22121 and a\nwestward phase propagation of 0.5 km s\u22121, equivalent to an\nazimuthal wave number, m, of \u223c\u221260. This represents the\nfirst observations of ULF waves with such characteristics at\nthe high latitudes of Svalbard. The wave event is similar to\nprevious observations of ULF waves with equatorward and\nwestward phase propagation at lower latitudes. The waves at\nall latitudes are consistent with a driving mechanism where\nenergy in population inversions in the overlying magneto-\nspheric energetic particles is fed into the ULF wave field\nthrough a drift resonance interaction. The particle energies of\nthese populations decreases as latitude increases, and it ap-\npears that suitable ion distribution functions exist in the over-\nlying magnetosphere for each latitude at which wave events\nhave been observed.\nAcknowledgements.
