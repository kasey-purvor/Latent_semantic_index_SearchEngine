Among the large number of \nsubstances found in wine, many are at very low concentrations even though they play a \nmain role in wine characteristics, evolution, and\/or quality. A complete analysis of wine \nis a time-consuming process, but it yields the necessary information for both elaboration \nof a quality product and conservation under proper conditions. Usually, the number of \nparameters to be analyzed is simplified as a function of the aim, the commonest being \neither to know the evolution of the process or to fulfill food laws. The more detailed the \nanalysis is, the better knowledge of the wine is achieved, but a compromise between time \nand information requirements must be established in order to guarantee a given quality \nwith minimum cost. Therefore, only a few parameters are periodically checked. Between \nthem, the most common are: soluble solids, reducing sugars, alcoholic degree, pH, total \nand volatile acidity, sulfur dioxide, color, polyphenol index, iron, and organic acids. \nMost analytical methods for monitoring wine composition recognized by the international \ncommunity as official methods of analysis are manual methods with high robustness and \nprecision, even though more recent methods may be based on modern automated \ninstrumental techniques. Nevertheless, the manual methods are slow, tedious, and require \na high level of human participation. Thus, their application is a balance between the \nnumber of parameters required for monitoring wine production, frequency of analysis, \nand cost of human and material resources. The new faster methods, which usually have \nthe appropriate sensitivity, selectivity, and precision, can circumvent the problem created \nby the large number of samples to be analyzed in order to guarantee proper monitoring of \nwine production. \nIn the last 10 years, rapid and high sample throughput methods of analysis have been \ndeveloped. It is interesting to know the features of these new methods\u2014mainly in terms \nof accuracy and precision\u2014for their potential application in enological laboratories. The \npossibility of automating methods commonly used in enological laboratories or applying \nnew methodologies in routine tasks is shown in the \u201cInternational Collection of analysis \nmethods for wines and musts\u201d edited by the \u201cOffice International de la Vigne et du Vin \n(OIV)\u201d (1990). Official implementation of these methods makes mandatory a previous \nexhaustive comparison with the International Official Methods of Analysis in order to \ndemonstrate the accuracy of the determinations and traceability of the data obtained. The  \nOIV protocol (Resolution OENO 6\/2000) enables evaluation of the requirements an \nanalytical method must accomplish for validation. \nThis review is aimed at showing the methods published in the last 10 years and \ncomparing their more outstanding analytical features with those of the official or \nreference methods established by the Office Internationale de la Vigne et du Vin (OIV). \nThe authors try to fill a gap in this field of applied analytical chemistry as there are no \nrecent reviews about the advances in analytical methods for determining the most typical \nenological parameters as done for traditional methods in the books from Ribereau-Gayon \n(1958) or Amerine and Ough (1976) and the compilation of the different official national \nand international regulations (EEC, 1989). Some previous reviews within the last ten \nyears have been devoted to groups of analytes (Wagner et al., 1992a; Mateo and Jim\u00e9nez, \n2000; Vereda-Alonso et al., 2000; Scollary, 1997; Rapp and Versini, 1996) or techniques \ninvolved in the methods (Luque de Castro and Luque-Garcia, 2000; Cserhati et al., 2000; \nNavas and Jim\u00e9nez, 1999; Wagner et al., 1992b; Baluja-Santos and Gonz\u00e1lez-Portal, \n1992; Dell\u2019Oro, 1991). They have not given an overall scope of the state-of-the-art of \nanalytical methods in this field. To outline the potential application of new continuous \nand discontinuous analytical methods in enology, they have first been grouped as a \nfunction of the analyte to be determined and then on whether they can be used in batch or \ncontinuous analysis. \n \nDetermination of the Alcoholic Degree \nAlcoholic degree is defined as the number of liters of ethanol contained in a hundred \nliters of wine. Most methods, both official or not, require a previous distillation step \n(simple or by steam dragging). Alcoholic degree traditionally has been determined in the \ndistillate either by picnometry, which is the international official method\u2014the \nrepeatability and reproducibility of this method are 0.1 and 0.19% (v\/v), respectively \n(OIV, 1990, p. 61); areometry, with a repeatability of \u00b10.1% II (v\/v) (Ribereau and \nPeinaud, 1958); by chemical oxidation, with a precision of \u00b10.04\u20130.07% (v\/v) (Amerine \nand Ough, 1976a); refractometry, with an error in measurement smaller than 2 \u00d7 10\u22125 g \nmL\u22121(Amerine and Ough, 1976b); by using a hydrostatic scale (Amerine and Ough, \n1976b); enzymatically, which yields a precision of \u00b10.6% (Amerine and Ough, 1976c); \nor by gas chromatography, with a precision of 0.2% (Amerine and Ough, 1976c). The \nmethod based on observation of the decrease in boiling point has a precision of 0.2% \n(v\/v) (Amerine and Ough, 1976d), and uses nondistilled wine. \n \nDiscontinuous Methods \nSome of the most outstanding discontinuous methods developed in the last 10 years are \nsummarized in Table 1. They are mainly based either on sensors, both chemical and \nbiochemical on derivatization reactions, or use of instrumental techniques. \nChemical sensors allow in situ monitoring of the analyte. They are simple devices with a \nfast response based generally on amperometry, so they do not require prior analyte \nderivatization (Tarnowski and Korzenieski, 1996; Promsong and Sriyudthsak, 1995). \nThey can also use optical transduction involving an optode membrane and derivatizing \nreagents such as trifluoroacetophenone (Seiler et al., 1991) or fluorescein derivatives \n(Zeng et al., 1994), thus providing wide linear calibration ranges. Amperometry is the \nmost common transduction technique for biosensors used for the determination of ethanol \nin wines. The biocatalyst immobilized in the active zone is either a dehydrogenase \n(Katriik et al., 1998; Garc\u00eda-Mullor et al., 1996; Garc\u00eda-Lobo et al., 1996; Boujita et al., \n1996; Wang and Nasser, 1995; Rueger et al., 1991; Zhao and Buck, 1991; Zhou et al., \n1993) or oxidase (Rueger et al., 1991). Sometimes, the nonisolate biocatalyst is used, as \nis the case with the whole aerobic bacterium (Wang et al., 1997). Most times, these \nbiosensors do not require sample pretreatment because the biocatalysis is selective \nenough. The sensitivity provided by biosensors allows establishing linear ranges of \nconcentration from 10\u22126 up to 0.1% (v\/v) using sample dilution as the only pretreatment.  \nDilution of the sample avoids biocatalyst inhibition and enlarges the biosensor lifetime, \nbut dilution is also the main source of error. The average precision of these methods is \nless than 2% of relative standard deviation (RSD), but they are not accurate enough to \nmeet the legal requirements. In addition, the nature of the matrix in fermentation \nprocesses, rich in proteases, can denature the immobilized biocatalyst, thus making \nbiosensor-based methods useless for monitoring these processes. \nMost chemical methods for the determination of ethanol are based on visible (Sasaki et \nal., 1993; Magri et al., 1997; Dai et al., 1996; Zhang, 1990) or infrared (Garcia-Jares and \nMedina, 1997; Luo and Liu, 1998) spectroscopy as detection techniques. The most usual \nmethod is based on the classical reaction with potassium dichromate and monitoring of \nthe Cr+3 formed (Magri et al., 1997). In other methods, the monitored species is the \nreaction product between the distillate and potassium ethyl ester (Zang et al., 1990), \nnickel bis (oo\u00b4-dipropyldithiophosphate) (Sasaki et al., 1993) or eosin (Dai et al., 1996). \nThese methods are expensive, time-consuming and have low sample throughput. The \naverage precision is similar to that obtained by the previous-mentioned methods and \nranges between 0.8% and 4% in terms of RSD.  \nMethods for determining alcoholic degree in wine have also been based on nuclear \nmagnetic resonance (NMR) detection (Barjat et al., 1993; Belton and Gadsby, 1992), \nwhich needs no previous treatment steps nor derivatization. Calibration curves are based \non the triplet of the methyl group, with linear range from 0.01% to 15% of ethanol with \nabsolute errors of \u00b10.3%. Simpler instrumentation than NMR detection is near-infrared \nspectroscopy (NIR) (P\u00e9rez-Ponce et al., 1996; Schindler et al., 1998), which requires only \nprior sample dilution. Linear ranges of these methods are suitable for winery \nrequirements, but they are neither accurate nor precise enough (RSD from 0.3% to 6.5%). \n \n \nContinuous Methods \nThe most remarkable continuous methods for the determination of ethanol in wine are \nsummarized in Table 2. These methods can be divided into chromatographic and \nnonchromatographic. \nThe former group involve HPLC or GC, whereas and the second are flow-injection \nmethods based on chemical or biochemical derivatizing reactions either with or without a \nprevious separation or clean-up step. \nIn GC methods, no derivatization or sample pretreatment is required and flame ionization \ndetection (FID) is used in all instances (Anon, 1998; Ames et al., 1997; Wu, 1992; Yan et \nal., 1992). In order to increase sensitivity, the headspace technique is sometimes used \n(Yan et al., 1992). Methods based on liquid chromatography make mandatory a \npretreatment step consisting of filtering, degassing, and diluting, and subsequent dialysis \nin some cases (Linget et al., 1998). The most common measurements are based on \nrefractive index (Falque-L\u00f3pez and Fern\u00e1ndez-G\u00f3mez, 1996; S\u00e1nchez-Mu\u00f1oz et al., \n1992; Calull et al., 1992), and some times, near infrared spectroscopy with Fourier \nTransform (Linget et al., 1998). The average precision (as RSD) is over 5%. In general, \nthese methods are not accurate enough for legal requirements and they are useless in \nroutine analysis with errors higher than 0.2% (v\/v), which is the maximum error \npermitted in trade analysis of wine. \nFlow injection (FI) is a low-pressure, low-cost continuous technique, the versatility and \navailability of which enable the desired level of automation to be implemented in \nenological laboratories. In addition, in-line location of separation\/preconcentration \nmodules endows the methods thus developed with the appropriate degree of selectivity \nand sensitivity. \nThe precision of FI methods surpasses or equalizes that of their batch counterparts. The \nflow injection methods for determination of ethanol developed so far can be divided \nmainly into three types according to the derivatization step: enzymatic methods (Wangsa \nand Danielson, 1991; Kuennecke and Schmid, 1990; Mattos et al., 1995; Xie et al., 1992; \nRangel and Toth, 2000) [using alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.1) or alcohol oxidase \n(EC 1.1.3.13)], redox methods based on oxidation of ethanol with dichromate in acid \nmedium (Mattos et al., 1998; Polo et al., 1986; Mataix and Luque de Castro, 2000a), and \nthose in which no derivatization is required (Chen et al., 1997; Mataix and Luque de \nCastro, 2000b; Gonz\u00e1lez-Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2003). In general, the separation techniques \nused, if necessary, are gas diffusion (Mattos et al., 1998; Polo et al., 1986; Mohns and \nKuennecke, 1995; Kuennecke and Schmid, 1990) or pervaporation (Delgado-Reyes et al., \n1998; Maitaix and Luque de Castro, 2000b; Gonz\u00e1lez-Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2003). The usual \ndetection techniques are spectroscopic (photometry or fluorimetry) and electrochemical \n(amperometry or potentiometry). A number of methods in the literature compare their \nresults with those from unofficial reference methods based on liquid or gas \nchromatography, and enzymatic and redox reactions, which do not offer accurate results. \nThe FI methods, in general, do not yield accurate but precise results (RSD 0.1%\u20133.9%). \nIn general, nonenzymatic FI methods are more precise than are enzymatic ones. The main \nerror sources of these methods are sample dilution and the lack of temperature control, \nwhich seriously affect the sample volume of alcoholic solutions. The error in most \nenzymatic methods is not high enough for rejection, and they are more suitable than are \nnonenzymatic methods for on-line monitoring because of the high sampling throughput. \nSome of the proposed FI methods (Mattos et al., 1995; Rangel and Toth, 2000; Mattos et \nal., 1998; Mataix and Luque de Castro, 2000a; Gonz\u00e1lez-Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2003) are \naccurate and precise enough to be used for the legal determination of ethanol content in \nwine. \n \nDiscontinuous vs. Continuous Methods \nIn comparing the characteristics of continuous and discontinuous methods, the accuracy \nand precision provided by the former are better than those of the latter. This can be due to \nlow degree of human participation, insufficient pretreatment steps or nonequilibrium \nmeasurements, which minimize matrix effects. The nonequilibrium methods are also the \nfastest, and so, are suitable for on-line fermentation monitoring. A preset accuracy is not \nrequired in these processes and a high analysis frequency is one of the most valuable \ncharacteristics. \nMany of the reviewed methods are compared with unofficial methods for validation. This \ninvolves a significant source of error. \n \nDetermination of Sulfur Dioxide \nMost methods for determination of sulfur dioxide are based on oxidation into sulphuric \nacid. The OIV reference method is based on removing sulfur dioxide from wine by a \nnitrogen or air stream, subsequent oxidation with H2O2 followed by titration of the \nsulphuric acid formed by a standard solution of sodium hydroxide (OIV, 1990, p.271). \nDifferentiation between free and bound sulfur dioxide is achieved by changing the \nworking temperature. \nAt 10\u00baC, only free sulfur dioxide is removed, whereas at 100\u00baC, both forms are removed. \nRepeatability and reproducibility depend on the content of sulfur dioxide in wine and \ntypically range within 1\u20136 mg l\u22121 and 9\u201315 mg l\u22121, respectively. The widely used \nRipper method (Amerine and Ough, 1976) consists of direct titration of sulfur dioxide by \niodine using starch as the indicator. This method has two main shortcomings: the \ndifficulty of proper distinction of the indicator change and the excess of iodine \nconsumption due to reaction with the matrix. These problems yield positive errors, \nparticularly in red wines, due to reagent consumption by polyphenols. \n \nDiscontinuous Methods \nDiscontinuous methods are scarce in the literature (Table 3), and are mainly based on \nelectrochemical detection [namely, amperometry (Kawamura et al., 1994; Nakamura et \nal., 1993; Gomes et al., 1996), or voltammetry (Baldo et al., 1994; Cardwell et al., 1991) \nto quantify the analyte, although molecular (Edberg, 1993) or atomic (Sarudi and \nKelemen, 1998) spectroscopy have also been used. \nThe methods proposed so far are precise\u2014average value of 3.8%, expressed as RSD, and \naccurate enough for accomplishing the OIV requirements. Electrochemical methods \nenable individual determination of free and bound sulfur dioxide, but in the case of \natomic methods the linear ranges are narrower than are required in order to analyze total \nsulphur dioxide. Therefore, a prior sample dilution is required in order to use them \nroutinely for measurement of this overall parameter. The sample throughput is low (4\u20136 \nh\u22121). \n \nContinuous Methods \nThe continuous methods in the literature for the determination of SO2 are also shown in \nTable 3. They involve sequential analysis of the two forms of the analyte by determining \nfree SO2 directly, then determining total SO2, and obtaining the bound form by \ndifference. \nSample pretreatment is only required for releasing bound SO2 and it consists of a basic \nhydrolysis. Gas diffusion (Azevedo et al., 1999; Silva et al., 1998; Kuban et al., 1998; \nAraujo et al., 1998; Su et al., 1998; Decnop-Weever and Kraak, 1997; Lin and Hobo, \n1996; Garc\u00eda-Prieto et al., 1994; Thanh et al., 1994; Huang et al., 1992; Bartroli et al., \n1991; Mana and Spohn, 2001; Segundo and Rangel, 2001; Segundo et al., 2000; \nCardwell and Christophersen, 2000; Atanassov et al., 2000) is the most common \nseparation technique if removal of the analyte from the matrix is required. The use of this \ntechnique provides slightly higher average precision (2.3% vs. 3.3%) than do other \nseparation techniques such as pervaporation (Mataix and Luque de Castro, 1999; Mataix \nand Luque de Castro, 1998), evaporation (Zhi et al., 1995), or ion exchange (Richter et \nal., 1993). \nDerivatization of SO2 may be accomplished with a variety of reagents, the most common \nbeing that based on reaction with the p-rosaniline+formaldehyde mixture (Lin and Hobo, \n1996; Mataix and Luque de Castro, 1999; Mataix and Luque de Castro, 1998; Richter et \nal., 1993). Biocatalyzed (Huang et al., 1992; Rezende and Mottola, 1994; Fatibello-Filho \nand da Cruz Vieira, 1997; Yao et al., 1994) or redox reactions using H2O2 (Su et al., \n1998; Huang et al., 1992; P\u00e9rez-Ruiz et al., 1993) and I2 (Kuban et al., 1998; Lin and \nHobo, 1996; Thanh et al., 1994) as oxidants are also used. Amperometric (Azevedo et al., \n1999; Thanh et al., 1994; Rezenda and Mottola, 1994; Cardwell et al., 1993; Cardwell et \nal., 1991b) and photometric detectors (Kuban et al., 1998; Decnop-Weever and Kraak, \n1997; Garc\u00eda-Prieto et al., 1994; Bartoli et al., 1991; Segundo, 2000; Atanassov et al., \n2000; Mataix and Luque de Castro, 1998; Zhi et al., 1995; Richter and Luque de Castro, \n1993; Fatibello-Filho and de Cruz-Vieira, 1997, P\u00e9rez-Ruiz et al., 1993) have been \nwidely used with similar frequency, providing similar accuracy and precision.  \nLess common is the use of potentiometric (Araujo et al., 1998; Mataix and Luque de \nCastro, 1999) and chemiluminescence detectors (Lin and Hobo, 1996; Huang, et al., \n1992). \nThe linear range of most methods is lower than is the normal content of SO2 in wines, \nwhich makes mandatory dilution of the sample with the concomitant error. The results \nobtained by FI methods agree with those provided by the reference methods. The \naccuracy ranges between 90%\u2013105%. The FI methods involving a separation step are \nsometimes even more robust than reference methods as the nonequilibrium conditions for \nmonitoring decrease the errors caused by the excess of iodine that the wine matrix \nconsumes. The previous separation step usually increases the selectivity and sensitivity of \nthe methods. High sampling frequencies (5\u2013120 h\u22121) and low detection limits (0.05\u20131.2 \nmg l\u22121) with none or limited interferences are also common characteristics of these \nmethods. \n \nDiscontinuous vs. Continuous Methods \nContinuous methods are widely compared with discontinuous methods in the literature \nwith the following general conclusions: the former provide higher sample throughput, \nhigher precision and accuracy, lower detection limits, lower reagent consumption, and \nlack of interferences or matrix effects when previous separation of the analyte is \nperformed.  \nIn the last five years, all the methods in the analytical literature for the determination of \nsulfur dioxide in wines are based on flow injection. This fact points out one of the present \ntrends in this area. \n \nDetermination of Reducing Sugars \nTraditional methods for measurement of reducing sugars are based on reduction of Cu+2 \nby carbonyl groups in boiling alkaline medium (Fehling, Ribereau-Gayon and Peinaud, \n1958, p. 222; Bertrand, Ribereau-Gayon and Peinaud, 1958, p. 227; Rebelein, Ribereau-\nGayon and Peinaud, 1958, p. 228), Luf-Schoorl, Matissek et al., 1992) and the official \nmethod of the OIV (OIV, 1990). In order to avoid interferences due to polyphenols, prior \nprecipitation is recommended using zinc ferricyanide or lead acetate. An acid hydrolysis \nof sucrose is mandatory in order to obtain glucose and fructose. The OIV (OIV, 1990) \nvalues for repeatability and reproducibility of the assays depend on the sugar content and \nthey are 0.015x and 0.058x, respectively (x is concentration of inverted sugar in g l\u22121). \n \nDiscontinuous Methods \nThere are only a few discontinuous methods in the literature for determining reducing \nsugars in wine. Some amperometric biosensors have been proposed for the determination \nof glucose and fructose using either glucose oxidase (Svorc et al., 1997; Bilitewski et al., \n1992; Miertus et al., 1998) or glucose dehydrogenase (Miertus et al., 1998; Stredansky et \nal.,1999) for the former and fructose dehydrogenase for the latter. The isolated enzymes \nare immobilized on different supports (membranes or other materials). These methods are \nprecise enough (RSD=1.8%\u20132.1%) for winery requirements and they need only prior \nsample dilution. The average lifetime of these biosensors is one month. The main \nproblem of these methods is the inhibition of the enzymes owing to wine components. \nSample dilution can, sometimes, overcome this problem. \nOther methods use potentiometry (Nanos and Karayannis, 1991)\u2014with tedious sample \npretreatment\u2014or NIR (Garc\u00eda-Jares and Medina, 1997) and Fourier transform infrared \n(FTIR) (Anderson et al., 2002) as detection techniques. The former require previous \nchemometric calibration using a validation set of samples with known concentrations, \nand the precision (RSD=5.3%) is not as good as that of the other methods. The advantage \nof the methods based on NIR is their ability for multidetermination, which compensates \nthe time required for calibration. \nNMR has been rarely used for sugar quantification (Barjat et al., 1993). Nevertheless, this \ntechnique is useful both for the detection of illegal sugar addition before wine \nfermentation (Kosir et al., 2000; Fauhl and Wittkowski, 1996) and differentiation of \nwines according to their geographical origin (Kosir et al., 2000). The instrumentation is \nexpensive, for both acquisition and maintenance, and needs skilled personnel to run it. \n \nContinuous Methods \nContinuous methods can be divided into chromatographic and nonchromatographic. \nThere are some references in the literature concerning the determination of reducing \nsugars by chromatographic methods in which sample treatment, if required, consists of \nfiltering or dilution. High pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) is the most common \ntechnique with (Lodi et al., 1994; Coquet et al., 1994; Murakami et al., 1991; Murakami \net al., 1996) or without (Linget et al., 1998; Wang et al., 1992; Kaufmann, 1993; Vonach \net al., 1998; Zhu et al., 1997c) post-column derivatization making use of glucose oxidase \nimmobilized in a reactor (Murakami et al., 1991) or on the surface of an electrode \n(Murakami et al., 1996). Methods based on photometric (Kaufmann, 1993), FTIR \n(Vonach et al., 1998), fluorimetric (Lodi et al., 1994; Coquet et al., 1994), refractive \nindex (Linget et al., 1998; Wang et al., 1992; Kaufmann, 1993) and amperometric \n(Murakami et al., 1991; Murakami et al., 1996; Zhu et al., 1997; Casella et al., 1998) \ndetection have also been reported. In general, low detection limits and good precision \n(average values smaller than 3% in terms of RSD) have been obtained for continuous \nmethods. Linear ranges of these methods make them suitable for most wine types, with or \nwithout previous dilution.  \nDespite the fact that no separation step is needed, dialysis is sometimes used (Appelqvist \nand Hansen, 1999) in flow infection (FI) methods. The derivatization step is based on a \nredox reaction, mainly with a copper salt (Yerba et al., 1993; Araujo et al., 2000; Peris-\nTortajada et al., 1992), or using immobilized enzymes [such as glucose oxidase (Yokoi et \nal., 1995; Matsumoto et al., 1991; Schuhmann, 1991), glucose dehydrogenase \n(Appelqvist and Hansen, 1999) or mannitol dehydrogenase (Kiba et al., 1991)] packed in \na reactor. Photometric detection of the reaction products is mainly used (Araujo et al., \n2000; Peris-Tortajada et al., 1992; Yokoi et al., 1995; Hsieh and Crouch, 1993; Hartmann \net al., 1994; Oliveira and Fatibello-Filho, 1999), but other alternatives such as \namperometry (Appelqvist and Hansen, 1999; Matsumoto et al., 1991; Kiba et al., 1991), \nfluorimetry (Schuhmann, 1991), or atomic spectroscopy (Lopes et al., 1995) have also \nbeen used.  \nAverage errors of these methods are about 7% and all them present good precision \n(RSD= 0.4%\u20133.9%). However, the lack of a previous precipitation step can yield error by \nexcess in red and dry wines. The results obtained by FI methods agree with those \nobtained by using enzymatic batch methods. Flow injection methods use the catalyst \nimmobilized on an appropriate support, which have the following advantages: low cost \nper analysis due to reuse of the biocatalyst, high sample throughput (50 h\u22121), and low \ndetection limits (0.05 g l\u22121). \n \nDiscontinuous vs. Continuous Methods \nThe most recent discontinuous methods for reducing sugars do not have advantages when \ncompared with continuous methods. The use of NMR can be justified in order to detect \nillegal sugar additions and differentiation of wines according to geographical origin. In \ngeneral, all the analytical features of the continuous methods found in the literature are \nbetter than are those of the discontinuous ones. The advantage of using chromatographic \nmethods is multidetermination. Most HPLC sugar methods in the literature also involve \nthe determination of organic acids. \n \nDetermination of Organic Acids \nThe organic acids usually determined in enological laboratories are malic, lactic, tartaric, \nand gluconic acids (Flanzy, 2000); and their monitoring is related to wine technological \nprocesses or quality aspects.  \nThe OIV reference method for the determination of L-malic acid in wines is based on \noxidation of malic acid to oxaloacetate under L-malate dehydrogenase catalysis using \n(nicotinamide-adenosine dinucleotide (NAD) as coenzyme. The concentration of the \nreduced form of the coenzyme (NADH) formed is photometrically monitored at 340 nm \n(OIV, 1990, p.195). Prior dilution of the sample is required when L-malic is over 350 mg \nl\u22121. The repeatability and reproducibility of these assays depend on the L-malic acid \ncontent and they are 0.03 + 0.034 x and 0.05 + 0.071 x, respectively (x is concentration \nof L-malic in the sample in g l\u22121). The reference method for lactic acid (OIV, 1990, \np.179) is also based on an enzymatic reaction by which the analyte is oxidized to piruvate \nby lactate dehydrogenase with photometric monitoring of the NADH formed. The \nrepeatability (r) and reproducibility (R) depend on the lactic acid concentration, r = 0.02 \n+ 0.07 x and R = 0.05 + 0.125 x (x= lactic acid concentration in g l\u22121). Prior dilution is \nalso required when L-lactic acid is over 100 mg l\u22121. The reference method for the \ndetermination of tartaric acid (OIV, 1990, p.169) consists of the gravimetric \ndetermination of tartaric acid after precipitation as racemic calcium tartrate. \nFinally, there is no official method used to determine gluconic acid in wine. The most \nusual method uses commercial enzymatic kits (Boehringer Mannherm Cat No 428191) \nfor the reaction of the analyte with gluconate kinase and adenosine-5\u2032-triphosphate and \nsubsequent reaction of the product and the oxidized form of nicotinamide-adenine \ndinucleotide phosphate (NADP+) catalyzed with 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase to \nyield ribulose-5-P and NADPH. The increase of NADPH is photometrically monitored. \n \nDiscontinuous Methods \nIn the literature there are some discontinuous methods for determining organic acids, \nboth for single and multidetermination. Of the former, the most important are those based \non enzymatic reactions. So, L-malic acid can be determined by L-malate dehydrogenase \ncatalysis with either spectrophotometric (Suye et al., 1992) or amperometric (Gillis and \nComtat, 1995) detection; meanwhile, the determination of L-tartaric acid is based on the \nsecondary activity of D-malate dehydrogenase and photometric detection (Tsukantani \nand Matsumoto, 1999). In general, average recoveries are between 98%\u2013103%, with \nRSD values close to 2%. There are no discontinuous methods in the literature for the \ndetermination of gluconic acid in wine that are different from that based on the \ncommercial enzymatic kit. \nThe discontinuous multidetermination methods for organic acids are exclusively based on \nFTIR (Patz et al., 1998; Schindler et al., 1998). These methods can determine most of the \ncommon organic acids. Other advantages of these methods include high degree of \nautomation, high sample throughput (20\u201330 h\u22121), simple sample preparation, and low \nanalysis costs; but the disadvantages include high instrument cost and the need for \nprecise, updated, and product specific calibrations. In general, these methods are \npreciseenough, but the accuracy is not appropriate without previous calibration with a \nhigh number of samples. \n \nContinuous Methods \n \nContinuous methods for the determination of organic acids are the most common in the \nliterature. They can be divided into nonchromatographic and chromatographic methods. \nThe former provide single determinations\u2013based on flow injection (FI) analysis\u2014and the \nlatter, multidetermination. Table 5 shows the FI methods for the determination of lactic, \nmalic, and tartaric acids reported in the last 10 years. The majority of these methods are \nbased on the use of enzymes both in solution and immobilized in a reactor and \nmonitoring of the reaction products by photometric (Rangel and Toth, 1998; Garcia-de-\nMaria et al., 1991; Mataix and Luque de Castro, 2001; Lima et al., 1998; Mallet et al., \n1999), fluorimetric (Mataix and Luque de Castro, 2001; Puchades et al., 1991; Kiba et al., \n1993), and chemiluminescence (Kiba et al., 1995; Hemmi et al., 1995) detectors. The \nbiocatalyst can also be immobilized on the surface of a potentiometric (Sales et al., 2001; \nUkeda et al., 1995) or amperometric (Serra et al., 1999; Yoshioka et al., 1992; Palleschi \net al., 1994) electrode. No sample pretreatment other than dilution is usually required, \nand when a separation step is required, it consists of dialysis. The linear ranges are, in \ngeneral, lower than are the usual values found in wines; therefore, prior sample dilution is \nusually required.  \nThe detection limits are much smaller than are the usual values found in wines for all the  \nstudied organic acids and, in general, high sample throughput is obtained (15\u201380 h\u22121). \nAverage precisions, in terms of RSD, are about 3.6% for lactic and tartaric acids and \n2.8% for malic acid. Average accuracies are between 92%\u2013102%in most cases. \nChromatographic methods for the determination of organic acids are mainly based on \nHPLC (Guan et al., 1993; Billingsley et al., 1996; Zerbinati et al., 1994; Escobal et al., \n1998; Escobal et al., 1997; Radin et al., 1994; Kaufmann, 1993; Chen and Hu, 1993; \nCalull et al., 1992; Vonach et al., 1998; Bi and Gu, 2000; Jun and Lima, 1996; Wang et \nal., 1993), but some methods based on gas chromatography (GC) (Hu and Li, 1993) and \nion chromatography (IC) (Mou et al., 1992; Gao and Fu, 1994; Yu et al., 1993) have been \ndeveloped. Capillary electrophoresis (CE) (Castineira et al., 2000) methods are also \nincluded in this section. \n \nMost of these methods enable multidetermination, but also single determinations of malic \n(lgler and Rauter, 1996) or lactic (Feng and Zhou, 1992) acids can be found in the \nliterature by using GC prior to analyte derivatization, which consists of methylation or \ntreatment with HClO4. Precisions between 1.8%\u20137% and accuracy values between 90%\u2013\n100% are obtained. Tartaric acid is also determined by using CE (Mallet et al., 1999) \nwith precision over 4% and accuracies ranging between 100%\u2013103%.  \nTable 6 shows some of the most notable continuous methods for the multi-determination \nof organic acids. HPLC methods are the most numerous, with no or very simple \npretreatment steps, without derivatization reactions, and use of photometric detectors \n(Guan et al., 1993; Billingsley et al., 1996; Zerbinati et al., 1994; Escobal et al., 1998; \nEscobal et al., 1994; Radin et al., 1994; Kaufmann, 1993; Chen and Hu, 1993), although \ndetectors based in refractive index measurements (Calull et al., 1992) and FTIR (Vonach \net al., 1996) are also used to yield overall average precision of about 3.7% in terms of \nRSD, and accuracy ranging between 90%\u2013106%. Use of HPLC even allows the \ndetermination of organic acid enantiomers (Buglass and Lee, 2000) in diluted wine and \ncodetermination of reducing sugars, ethanol, and glycerol (Kaufmann, 1993). A GC \nmethod (Hu and Li, 1993) is based on derivatization of the organic acids into volatile \nesters with flame ionization detection and recoveries between 96%\u2013105%, but without \nsufficient enough precision (RSD=1.1%\u201314.5%) even through accuracy is acceptable. \nMethods based on ion chromatography (Gao and Fu, 1994; Yu et al., 1995) require \nprevious sample dilution, but not derivatization. These methods show good precision, \nRSD= 1.4%, and average accuracy values between 94%\u2013103%.  \nOther alternatives for multidetermination of organic acids use capillary electrophoresis \n(Castineira et al., 2000) with no previous derivatization and photometric detection, and \ngive good precision (RSD= 1%) and recovery ranging between 90%\u2013102%.  \n \nDiscontinuous vs. Continuous Methods \nA number of advantages of continuous methods when compared with discontinuous \nmethods can be found. Single parameter determination using continuous methods are \nendowed with high sample throughput and low maintenance or reagents cost. This aspect \nmakes them suitable for on-line determinations in evolving processes, for which the \naccuracy and precision of these methods are good enough. They are based on FI and, \nbecause of their modular design, the experimental setup can be located either at-line or \non-line in industrial plants to monitor processes such as malolactic fermentation. Single \ndeterminations based on discontinuous methods are accurate and precise but tedious and \nhave low sample frequency, so their use is limited. \nOne promising alternative to continuous methods are methods based on FTIR, which are \ndiscontinuous methods but easy to automate and with high sample throughput. They are \nprecise and allow organic acid multidetermination that yields additional information \nabout ethanol, reducing sugars content, and other enological parameters such as pH and \nvolatile and total acidity. These methods need specific calibration with a large number of \nsamples of previously determined concentrations. The wide ranges of wine components \nseriously affect the determination of these parameters, thus making long and tedious \nsingle calibrations for each kind of wine mandatory. These methods are accurate enough \nwhen these requirements are accomplished, and periodical updated calibration is carried \nout. Nowadays, these methods are used for screening and monitoring processes when a \nhigh accuracy is not required. \nWhen high accuracy and\/or precision are required, at present HPLC methods are the best \noption. The chromatographic separation avoids matrix effects and offers the possibility \nfor organic acids multidetermination and additional determinations of reducing sugars \nand ethanol, thus making them suitable for quality control. The disadvantages of these \nmethods are low sample throughput and high maintenance costs, shortcomings that are \ncompensated by the amount of information each analysis provides. \n \nDetermination of Titratable and Volatile Acidity \n \nTotal or titratable acidity is the sum of all acids present in wine expressed as g of tartaric \nacid l-1. The official method consists of titration with NaOH up to pH 7.0 (OIV, 1990, \np.155) or 8.2 (AOAC, 1970, p.144) depending on whether the OIV or AOAC criterium is \nfollowed, respectively. The OIV official method is based on potentiometric or \ncolorimetric titration of total acids in wine, and the repeatability is 0.07 g of tartaric acid \nl-1 for both white and red wines, with, reproducibility & either 0.3 g of tartaric acid l-1or \n0.4 g of tartaric acid l-1 for both white and red wines, respectively. \nVolatile acidity is due to organic acids such as formic, acetic, or butyric acids. Traditional \nmethods are based on wine distillation, with (Ribereau-Gayon et al., 1976, p.256) or \nwithout (Ribereau-Gayon et al., 1976, p.254) addition of water or on extraction with \nwater vapor (OIV, 1990, p.159). The official method of analysis is based on the latter \nseparation step. In all cases, subsequent titration with NaOH and correction for avoiding \nthe contribution from SO2 or sorbic acid are made. The repeatability and reproducibility \nof the official method are 0.04 g of acetic acid l-1 and 0.08 g of acetic acid l-1, \nrespectively. \n \nDiscontinuous Methods \n \nThere is in the literature only a recent discontinuous method for the determination of \nvolatile acidity (Garcia-Jares and Medina, 1995) however, there are some methods for the \ndetermination of total or titratable acidity. The method to determine volatile acidity also \nallows the determination of the total acidity, and it consists of a partial least squares \nmodel that relates UV\/visible wine spectra with these two parameters. Conventional \nmethods for the determination of total acidity are simple, and are based on the usual \nprinciple to determine total acidity, with either voltammetric (Ohtsuki et al., 2001; Baldo \net al., 1998) or potentiometric (Cardwel et al., 1992) detection. These methods do not \nrequire a previous sample treatment nor separation, but they do not offer advantages, with \nrespect to the existing methods, in accuracy, precision, or sample throughput.  \n \nContinuous Methods \nThere are in the literature six continuous methods, all based on FI, for the determination \nof one or the two of the parameters in a sequential way; three of them involve a \nseparation step, which is not required in the other three. The technique used for analyte \nseparation in the case for volatile acidity has been gas diffusion (Barros and Turbino, \n1992) or analytical pervaporation (Mataix and Luque de Castro, 1999; Gonz\u00e1lez-\nRodriguez et al., 2001) with subsequent photometric or conductimetric detection. One of \nthem, which is based on flow injection-pervaporation (Mataix and Luque deCastro, 1999) \nenables the sequential determination of the total and volatile acidity. These methods are \nprecise (RSD < 5%) and accurate enough (error < 4%) for accomplishing the OIV \nrequirements for validation. \nThey are also endowed with high sample throughput (10\u201360 h\u22121) and capability for \nautomation, thus making them suitable for winery requirements. Continuous methods for \ndetermination of total acidity in wines (Mataix and Luque de Castro, 1999; Gaiao et al., \n1999; Rangel and Toth, 1998) without separation steps use photometric detection and \nacid-base colored indicators. These methods are simple, fast, accurate, and precise \nenough (average RSD < 5%) to accomplish OIV requirements. Only previous debubbling \nis required in order to remove carbonic acid from wine, which is not included in total \nacidity. \n \nDiscontinuous vs. Continuous Methods \nAll continuous methods are based on flow injection and endowed with the characteristics \nof this technique, thus allowing an advantageous comparison with discontinuous \nmethods. The latter only are useful in the case of multidetermination, as in the method \nproposed by Garc\u00eda-Jares and Medina (1995), which enables determination of pH, free \nSO2, tannins, and total anthocyans. The continuous method developed by Mataix and \nLuque de Castro (1999) enables the sequential determination of total and volatile acidity. \nAmong the methods for detecting volatile acidity, the most accurate results are obtained \nby those involving separation steps, as matrix effects are thus avoided. \n \nDetermination of Iron \nAtomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) is the technique used for the official \ndetermination of iron in wine (OIV, 1990, p. 221) along with the previous steps of wine \ndilution, if required, and removal of ethanol. The most usual method for iron analysis in \nwineries is based on molecular absorption after complex formation with \northophenanthroline (OIV, 1990, p.222) or thyocianate (Amerine and Ough, 1976) and \nphotometric monitoring at 508 nm. \n \nDiscontinuous Methods \nAtomic absorption spectrometry has been widely proposed for the determination of iron \n(Subecic et al., 1998; Chmilenko and Baklanova, 1997; Escobal et al., 1995; Olalla et al., \n2000) after a mineralization step in order to obtain the total content of iron in wine. These \nmethods are accurate (average accuracy range between 98%\u2013101%), selective, with high \nprecision (RSD < 2%), and have low detection limits. A simple and cheap alternative to \nAAS is photometric detection after a derivatization reaction, which can consist of \nforming a complex with thyocianate (Ga and Liu, 1996), triazine (Toral and \nAlmendrades, 1991) or phenanthroline (Capit\u00e1n-Garia et al., 1995) or even using optical \nsensors (Capit\u00e1n-Vallvey et al., 2001). These methods show high reproducibility, low \ndetection limits (about 40 \u03bcg l\u22121), high selectivity, and precision below 2% in terms of \nRSD. Iron can also be determined by electroanalytical techniques such as polarography \n(V\u00e1zquez-D\u00edaz et al., 1994) and stripping voltammetry (Miao, 1993) or by fluorimetric \nmethods with prior derivatization with fluorescent reagents (Fang and Zhang, 1993; Wu \net al., 1999; Mannino and Brambilla, 1992; Zeng and Jewsbury, 2000), with average \nprecision <1.5%, expressed as RSD, and accuracy values below 5%. \n \nContinuous Methods \nThere are few continuous methods in the literature to determine iron, most them with \nbased on flow injection using derivatization reactions with thyocianate (Gonz\u00e1lez-\nRodr\u00edguez et al., 2002), phenanthroline (Neira et al., 2000), or hydroxylamine (Cladera et \nal., 1991) and photometric detection or derivatization with pioverdin (Pulido-Tofino et \nal., 2000) with fluorimetric detection. On-line determination of Fe+3 and total iron (de \nCampos-Costa and Araujo, 2001) can be performed by using thyocianate and photometric \ndetermination for the former and AAS for the latter. The FI methods are precise (RSD < \n4%) and fast (20\u201330 h-1). \n \nDiscontinuous vs. Continuous Methods \nIn this case, as for total and volatile acidity, all continuous methods based on flow \ninjection allow an advantageous comparison with discontinuous methods. Derivatization \nprior to photometric detection is usually performed in all methods found in the literature, \nboth continuous and discontinuous, rather than AAS detection, with similar values of \naccuracy and precision. \n \nTotal Polyphenols \nTotal polyphenols content in wines involves all compounds with a phenolic structure, \ndescribed either by an adimensional index or by making a relationship with a standard \ncompound, usually gallic acid. Most of these methods are based on the reducing \nproperties of these compounds using potassium permanganate (permanganate index) \n(Ribereau-Gayon et al., 1976, p. 272) mixtures of phosphomolibdic and phosphotungstic \nacids (Folin-Ciocalteau) (OIV, 1990 p. 269) or iron (II) (Jerumanis index) (Ribereau-\nGayon et al., 1976, p. 274) as oxidizing reagents. Folin-Ciocalteau is the OIV reference \nmethod and it is used in the European union EU as the official method of analysis with \nrepeatability values smaller than 1, expressed as RSD. The absorbance measurement at \n280 nm (t.p.i.) is also used as a simpler but less sensitive method (Ribereau-Gayon et al., \n2000). \n \nDiscontinuous Methods \nDiscontinuous methods for the determination of polyphenols in wines are mainly based \non FTIR for analyte multidetermination (Patz et al, 1999), which present the same \nadvantages and shortcomings described in the determination of organic acids. The \nmethod based on the use of a horseradish peroxidase biosensor (Imabayashi et al., 2001) \nfor catalyzing the oxidation of polyphenols by H2O2 has several advantages over the \nFolin-Ciocalteau method; namely; there is shorter analysis time, smaller sample volume, \nand greater tolerance to interfering substances. The use of cyclic voltammetry (Kilmartin \net al., 2001) to characterize antioxidants, phenolics included, has also been proposed. \n \nContinuous Methods \nFlow injection methods for the determination of the total polyphenol index in wine are \nbased on either measurement of the absorbance at 280 nm (Mataix and Luque de Castro, \n2001; Gonz\u00e1lez-Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2002) or the use of the Folin-Ciocalteau reagent \n(Celeste et al., 1992) with photometric detection. Both methods are simple and fast, with \nsample throughput ranging between 30\u201390 h-1. \nOther recently proposed methods are based on liquid chromatography (Rodr\u00edguez-\nDelgado et al., 2001; Carrero-G\u00e1lvez et al., 1994) and capillary electrophoresis (Pazourek \net al., 2000), which have been shown to be faster and more sensitive than the official or \nusual methods, but they do not provide an overall index of the total polyphenols content \nin wine. They give only the individual content of the most relevant phenolic compounds. \n \nContinuous vs. Discontinuous Methods \nIn general, the most usual methods for monitoring polyphenols present in wines are based \non an overall index. Continuous methods yield better results than do discontinuous \nmethods with higher sample throughput and similar precision and accuracy. Continuous \nmethods for individual multidetermination of phenolic compounds are useful in order to \nobtain phenol profiles but they are not useful for industrial process monitoring. \n \nOther Determinations: Soluble Solids, pH, and Color \n \nSoluble Solids \nSoluble solids refer to all substances, other than water, that are in the liquid phase of wine \nor must. They also receive other names such as volumic mass (g mL-1), relative density, \nOechsle (\u00baOe), Brix degree (% m\/m sacarose), and refractive index, depending on both \nthe units and determination procedure. The official method for the analysis of soluble \nsolids in wine is picnometry (OIV, 1990, p. 41). \nThere are, in the literature, only two continuous methods for the determination of soluble \nsolids in wines, both based on flow injection with piezoelectric (Magna et al., 1996) or \nphotometric detection (Mataix and Lugue de Castro, 2001). The first one presents a linear \nresponse between 0.5\u201320 Brix degree, with a detection limit of 0.3% and precision lower \nthan 1.45%, in terms of RSD. The second method is based on the displacement of a light \nbeam when the refractive index of the medium changes, with precision less than 2.3% in \nterms of RSD and sample throughput of 90 h-1. \n \npH \nMeasurement & pH has traditionally been year based on the use of the well-known \ncalomel-glass electrode. Presently, a new generation of FT-IR instruments enables the \ndetermination of pH together with others; namely, ethanol, titratable acidity, volatile \nacidity, reducing sugars, etc. with good correlation with the reference laboratory methods \n(Kupina and Shrikhande, 2003). \n \nColor \nThe reference method to determine color in wines is the tri-stimulus method (OIV, 1990), \nbased on the use of three special filters combined with a light source and a photocell. The \nmost usual method to determine color in wine is based on photometric measurements at \n420, 520, and 620 nm (OIV, 1990, p. 29). Another method, known as the Cielab system \n(Cruz-Ortiz et al., 1995), is based on the use of chromatic diagrams. \nNo new methods for color have been proposed, probably due to the simplicity and nature \nof this determination. \n \nConclusions \nOne of the conclusions from this study is that some of the traditional methods, namely, \nsoluble solids, pH, or color have not been modified in recent years, whereas others, such \nas those for organic acids, ethanol, volatile acidity, iron, or polyphenols, have \nexperienced noticeable improvements in addition to the appearance of new methods as \ndeduced from the literature.  \nMethods in the literature do not usually fulfill the requirements of the OIV to validate an \nusual method of analysis vs. a reference one. Most proposed methods do not accomplish \nthe minimum period of continuous application (a month) in order to establish both a \nreproducibility value according to this protocol, and the number of samples used for \nrepeatability (30 pairs of samples) and reliability studies (50 samples). Traceability is \nbroken by using unofficial reference methods that do not guarantee the accuracy of the \nresults obtained. The fact that most methods described in the literature do not accomplish \nthe OIV validation protocol does not mean that they are useless for the analysis of wines. \nThe conclusion is that the results obtained with these new methods cannot be compared \nwith the reference or official ones and, therefore, they lack traceability (a mandatory \nrequirement to obtain quality data). An in-depth validation of the most promising \nmethods would open new perspectives on potential change of both official and usual \nmethods in Enology. \nContinuous methods, when used for routine analyses, are useful tools to minimize the \nanalysis time, to reduce reagent consumption, and to increase the number of analyses in \nwineries. In general, the new methods are faster than are traditional methods, with equal \nor lower sensitivity, but with sufficient precision for winery requirements. This last \naspect makes them suitable for monitoring fermentation and post-fermentation processes \nand, sometimes, for quality control of the final product. The rapidity of continuous \nmethods could be the starting point for more frequent analyses, which would result in \nbetter knowledge of wine processing and aging, and better quality of the final product as \na result. \nIt is important to emphasize the growing use of multidetermination methods based on \nFTIR, which provide wide information about the target sample. The main drawback of \nthese methods is the need for proper assessment studies in order to validate the results. \nContinuous updating of these methods, as a consequence of changes in the wine produced \naccording to the annual characteristics of the raw material, is mandatory. The updating \nprocess could be the seed for incipient research in wineries, which would become the first \nstep to start research and development, which are absent in most wineries at present. \n \nAcknowledgment \nSpain\u2019s Comisi\u00f3n Interministerial de Ciencia y Tecnolog\u00eda (CICyT) is thanked for \nfinancial support \n(Project BQU-2003-01333). \n \nReferences \nAmerine, M.
