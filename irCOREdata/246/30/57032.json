We investigated this experimentally for caged \nmink, and found that they would pay high costs to perform a range of natural \nbehaviours, and release cortisol if their most preferred activity, swimming, was \nprevented. Mink on fur farms may thus suffer from frustration.   \nFur farming is widespread in North America, Scandinavia and Europe, \napproximately 30 million mink pelts being produced annually worldwide. On farms, \nAmerican mink (Mustela vison) are kept in wire mesh cages c. 0.9 x 0.4 x 0.3 m \ncontaining a single nest-box, and access to drinking-water and a paste-like \nfood. Those opposed to fur farming claim that this causes frustration\u001f, as in \nthe wild, mink would patrol territories 1-4 km long, use several nest-sites, and \nhunt by following scent trails, investigating burrows, and diving and swimming \nfor aquatic prey\u001f. Others, however, argue that farmed minks' excellent health \nand breeding success show adaptation to captivity \u001f \u001f. We addressed this issue \nobjectively by measuring the costs paid by farm-raised mink to acquire resources \nenabling natural behaviours. Because of the key role of pleasure in motivating \nchoice behaviour \u001f \u001f this approach pinpoints activities important for welfare.  \nEight male and eight female adult mink were individually housed in closed \neconomy\u001f set-ups, each consisting of a conventional farm cage, plus seven \nsimilarly-sized resource compartments. These contained: 1) access to a water-\npool beneath the cage, c. 1.5m x 0.5m, filled with 0.2m water; 2) a raised \nplatform reached by a 2m vertical wire tunnel; 3) novel objects (e.g. discarded \npackaging, traffic cones, etc., changed daily); 4) an alternative nest-site (a \nwire box of hay); 5) toys for manipulation and chewing (e.g. tennis balls); and \n6) a plastic tunnel; the seventh was left empty, to control for the importance \nof accessing additional space. Access costs were imposed by weighting one-way \nentrance-doors by 0kg, 0.25kg, 0.5kg, 0.75kg, 1kg or 1.25kg for seven successive \ndays. Compartment-use was automatically recorded 24h\/day, allowing calculation \nof four measures of value. The results are given in Table 1.  \nUsing seven males and seven females, we then blocked access to each of four \nresources for 24 hours to record endocrine stress responses \u001f. These were \nbehavioural resources of high, intermediate, and low value (the water-pool, \nalternative nest-site and empty compartment respectively), and an essential \nphysiological resource: food. During each treatment, urine was collected for the \nassay of excreted cortisol; creatinin was also assayed to enable correction for \ndifferences in urinary concentration. When deprived of food, urinary cortisol \nincreased by 50.0\u00b116.1% over baseline levels (Paired t = 2.77, df = 13, p < \n0.05); it also increased, by 33.8\u00b111.2%, when access to the water-pool was \nblocked (t = 2.75, p < 0.05). These two effects did not significantly differ (t \n= 2.47, p > 0.05). Cortisol excretion did not increase in the other two \ntreatments. Consistent with cortisol's metabolic functions8, when deprived of \nthe food or water-pool, these responses correlated with increases in the \nanimals' activity levels (Food: R = 0.49, p = 0.07; Pool: R = 0.70, p = 0.005; n \n= 14), although overall changes in activity only reached significance during \nfood deprivation (t = 2.45, df = 13, p = 0.03).  \nThus despite being captive-bred for over seventy generations4, raised from birth \nin farm conditions, and provided with ad lib. food, our subjects retained \nmotivations to perform natural behaviours.  Use of a water-pool attracted the \ngreatest total expenditure, and had the highest reservation price, greatest \nconsumer surplus measure of utility, and most inelastic demand.  Preventing this \nalso caused a cortisol response indistinguishable from that caused by food \ndeprivation. These results suggest that caging mink on fur farms does cause \nfrustration, particularly by preventing swimming.  \n621 wds \n \nGeorgia J.

Consumer Surplus, used by human welfare \neconomists to assess resource value\u001f, was calculated by measuring the area under \ntwo types of demand curve: a plot of visit price versus visit number, analogous \nto the 'travel cost method' of environmental economists\u001f; and an aggregate plot \nof price versus the number of subjects prepared to pay 9. Reservation Price 9, \nakin to the 'break point' \u001f of experimental psychologists, was calculated as the \nmaximum price paid to reach each resource. Total Expenditure per unit time, as \ngiven precedence by behavioural ecologists \u001f, was also calculated, shown here \nfor the six weeks of the experiment. All values are means and standard errors (n \n= 16) except for Aggregate Consumer Surplus. Low elasticities of demand indicate \nlittle decline in visit rate as visit costs increase; for all remaining \nmeasures, a high numeric value indicates a high usage value.
