We conducted the first-ever survey of 11-16 year olds. \nMethods: In 2006, we interviewed a cluster sample of 1011 children, their caregivers and teachers, \nrandomly sampled in 25 government-operated schools within three purposively chosen areas.  For \nstudents, we administered the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) to predict likely \npsychiatric disorder from multi-informant ratings; the Depression Self-Rating Scale; and an Impact \nof Events Scale.  For caregivers, we used both international and culturally-specific screening \ninstruments (Self-Reported Questionnaire; Afghan Symptom Checklist).  We implemented a \nChecklist of Traumatic Events to examine the exposure to and nature of traumatic experiences.\nFindings:  Two risk factors, trauma exposure and caregiver mental health, were present across all \nchild outcomes.  SDQ ratings were associated with female gender (OR=2.47[1.65,3.68]), 5+ \ntraumatic events (OR=2.58[1.36,4.90]), caregiver mental health (OR=1.11[1.08,1.14]), and \nresidence areas (OR=0.29[0.17,0.51] and OR=0.37[0.23,0.57] vs. Kabul as reference).  The same \nvariables predicted depressive symptoms.  Two-thirds of children reported traumatic experiences.  \nSymptoms of post-traumatic stress were associated with 5+ events (OR=3.07[1.78,5.30]), caregiver \nmental health (OR=1.06[1.02,26.6]) and child age (OR=1.19[1.04,1.36].  Children's most \ndistressing trauma included accidents, medical treatment, domestic and community-level violence, \nas well as war-related events.\nInterpretation:  Young Afghans experience ongoing exposure to violence, which is not narrowly \nconfined to war-related events. The study highlights the potential value of school-based initiatives \nto address child mental health, and the importance of understanding trauma in the context of \n'everyday' forms of suffering, violence and adversity.\n1R3: RESPONSE to referee comments and R3 word count\nThank you for the opportunity to revise and re-submit our paper to the Lancet.  We \nhave responded to all the comments from Reviewer #9 as detailed below.  \nR3 word count: 5,351 (text) and 244 (abstract). Signed permissions provided with R2.\n1. Overview\nReviewer #9: \u201cThis is a well planned and accomplished study addressing an issue of \nmajor importance - what happens to mental health in youth who grow up in a war \nzone. The results of the study go beyond the obvious fact that war is bad for children, \nand the authors describe thoroughly and well organized the terrible facts of health \nconsequences. They also demonstrate very clearly how violence spreads from war \nitself to more indirect expressions, increasing the burden for those who are close to \nthe war zones. Yet, the article also contain certain aspects on resilience and hope, \nalthough not pursuing these in depth.  I understand that the original manuscript \ncovered a miced-methods approach, upon which the previous reviewers have given \nthe advice to prioritize the quantitative data in this article. Presentation of mixed-\nmethod designs is usually quite challenging, and clarity of presentation is not always \nenhanced when such ambitions are high.  I therefore endorse the advice already given, \nand have concentrated on the task of reviewing the few remaining traces of the \nqualitative approach.\u201d\nAuthors\u2019 response: Thank you for this positive opinion of our work and support for \nthe modifications made to the paper in light of a previous review, regarding \nprioritising of epidemiological data.\n2. Presentation of the qualitative data\nReviewer #9: \u201cAt p 8 (last paragraph before Findings) content analysis of verbatim \ndescriptions is presented as a way of subtyping participants' most distressing lifetime \nevent. The frequencies have been quantified and presented in Figure 4. At p 10, \nexamples of such specifications are listed and partly quantified as percentages before \nand after Taliban. At page 12, these examples are used to extend the discussion about \nthe conceptual understanding of trauma. I would strongly warn against quantification \nand percentages of open-ended, non-standardized expressions, since we would never \nknow how many would have checked this or that alternative if they had been asked. I \nwould therefore suggest all percentages to be removed from Figure 4 and p 10, as they \nare misleading regarding the distribution of the different trauma aspects. However, \npresented as textual examples, they function very well to provide nuances to the crude \ncategories. This way of presenting should therefore be maintained.\u201d\nAuthors\u2019 response: We have followed the referee\u2019s recommendations and removed \nfrom Figure 4 and p.10 the percentages which refer to sub-types of traumatic events.  \nThe percentages reported in the text and figures are now confined to strictly \nquantitative data collected using the 21-item (yes\/no response) Traumatic Events \nChecklist.  \n* Reply to Reviewers Comments\n2We agree with the referee that the paper delivers its message without inclusion of \npercentage figures for sub-types of trauma, namely that children assign significance to \n\u2018everyday\u2019 violence as well as \u2018militarized\u2019 violence in the recollection of traumatic \nexperiences. \nSpecific changes made to the text are detailed in bold:\na) P.8: Content analysis\u2026. These sub-types are shown in Figure 4 for three of six \nmain categories, in order to illustrate the range of events reported.  Thematic \nanalysis of respondent narratives will be published elsewhere.\nb) P.10: Children\u2019s most distressing lifetime trauma\u2026  In the first category \n(injury), children reported serious accidents, severe beatings by relatives or \nneighbours, frightening medical treatments, and painful illnesses without \nmedical care; only 4 respondents mentioned war-related events such as landmine \ninjury.  The second category (witnessing violence) included war-related events \n(summary executions\/beatings during Taliban rule, deaths from rocket explosions, \nmutilated\/dead bodies), but also community-level and domestic violence.  The \ndeaths\/losses of close relatives reported in the third category were primarily related to \nwar, but also included accidents and criminal acts. The lifetime events reported as \nmost distressing included both past and ongoing exposure to violence, during the \nTaliban period and after the fall of their regime (2001).  Remarkably, many \nchildren escaped the burden of traumatic experiences, either reporting no exposure at \nall (36.5%) or exhibiting little psychological sequelae (CRIES scores) to adverse life \nevents.  \nc) Figure 4: Removed all percentages referring to sub-types of trauma.  \n3.  Discussion of rape of sexual abuse\n\u201cFinally, I wonder why there is no explicite questions or discussions on rape or sexual \nabuse, since the gender proportion here is so strong, and since we know that rape is a \nterrible side-effect of war.\u201d\nAuthors\u2019 response: Rape and sexual abuse of children are important subjects in their \nown right, which we feel we cannot adequately address within the scope of this paper.\nWe have not made changes to the ms on this point for the following reasons:\nWe did not explicitly collect data on rape or sexual abuse, as this would have been \ninappropriate in the context of school-based survey of 11-16 year olds in Afghanistan.\nWe did include items on our Traumatic Events Checklist for exposure to \u2018severe \nbeating\u2019 and \u2018severe injury\u2019, as well as a category for \u2018any other event.\u2019  Within these \ncategories, children did not report any instances of rape or sexual abuse, but did report \nexperiencing or witnessing domestic beatings and other forms of violence.\nOur Traumatic Events Checklist was adapted from the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire \n(HQT) and the Gaza Traumatic Event Checklist (Gaza TEC).  A specific question on \nrape is featured in the HQT and was implemented in two household surveys of adult \nmental health in Afghanistan. It is not, however, featured in the Gaza TEC - for 7-12 \nyear old children.\n3Our Afghan partners strongly advised against including specific questions on rape and \nsexual abuse on the Trauma Events Checklist we implemented. Testimony of rape or \nsexual abuse has severe legal implications in Afghanistan, and dramatic repercussions \non individual and family \u201chonour.\u201d  Our partners believed that a direct evocation of \nthese topics during interviews with children would have compromised the survey.  \nIn light of the reviewer\u2019s query, we re-examined literature on rape or sexual abuse in \nAfghanistan.  Several Human Rights Watch reports draw attention to anecdotal \nevidence of the rape and sexual assault of women, girls and boys by mujahidin groups \nand the Taliban in Afghanistan.  They also underline the numerous obstacles to \nsystematically documenting and verifying such violations. This a complex subject to \ninvestigate in the Afghan context, where definitions of rape and sexual violence are \ncontested and for which there are no reliable data on the prevalence of such abuse for \nchildren.\n1ONGOING VIOLENCE, SUFFERING AND MENTAL HEALTH:\nA SCHOOL-BASED SURVEY IN AFGHANISTAN\nBackground: Previous surveys in Afghanistan have documented significant mental health \nproblems among adults. We conducted the first-ever survey of 11-16 year olds.\nMethods: In 2006, we interviewed a cluster sample of 1011 children, their caregivers and \nteachers, randomly sampled in 25 government-operated schools within three purposively \nchosen areas.  For students, we administered the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire \n(SDQ) to predict likely psychiatric disorder from multi-informant ratings; the Depression \nSelf-Rating Scale; and an Impact of Events Scale.  For caregivers, we used both international \nand culturally-specific screening instruments (Self-Reported Questionnaire; Afghan Symptom \nChecklist).  We implemented a Checklist of Traumatic Events to examine the exposure to and \nnature of traumatic experiences.\nFindings:  Two risk factors, trauma exposure and caregiver mental health, were present \nacross all child outcomes.  SDQ ratings were associated with female gender \n(OR=2.47[1.65,3.68]), 5+ traumatic events (OR=2.58[1.36,4.90]), caregiver mental health \n(OR=1.11[1.08,1.14]), and residence areas (OR=0.29[0.17,0.51] and OR=0.37[0.23,0.57] vs. \nKabul as reference).  The same variables predicted depressive symptoms. Two-thirds of \nchildren reported traumatic experiences.  Symptoms of post-traumatic stress were associated \nwith 5+ events (OR=3.07[1.78,5.30]), caregiver mental health (OR=1.06[1.02,26.6]) and child \nage (OR=1.19[1.04,1.36].  Children\u2019s most distressing trauma included accidents, medical \ntreatment, domestic and community-level violence, as well as war-related events.\nInterpretation: Young Afghans experience ongoing exposure to violence, which is not \nnarrowly confined to war-related events. The study highlights the potential value of school-\nbased initiatives to address child mental health, and the importance of understanding trauma\nin the context of \u2018everyday\u2019 forms of suffering, violence and adversity.\nWord count (text only): 5,359\nManuscript\n2INTRODUCTION\nChild and adolescent mental health sits high on the international public health \nagenda.1 According to researchers working in conflict zones, however, there is still \u201ca serious \ndearth of systematic empirical information\u201d on war-affected and displaced youth.2,3 The \nliterature shows an overwhelming focus on identifying traumatic stress and other negative \nsequelae of war, to a point where calls have been made to identify factors underlying \nvulnerability and resilience to social and economic upheaval in the wake of war,4,5 rather than \njust confirm the obvious - that \u201cwar is bad for children.\u201d6 Current research and policy \ninitiatives in conflict and disaster settings also seek to broaden the evidence base, through \nexamining a fuller range of psycho-social dimensions of mental health. 7-9 The literature \nhighlights crucial gaps in research, policy and practice regarding war-affected children10 and \ndemands rigorous research to inform a broader understanding of psychosocial wellbeing and \nmental health. In this context, a child-focused assessment of trauma, suffering and social \nfunctioning is vital.  \nAfghanistan has endured a combination of armed conflict, widespread poverty and \nsocial injustice.  State education and healthcare systems have been severely crippled, as were \ncommunity networks of social support.11,12 Previous large-scale surveys have documented a \nbroad spectrum of mental health problems in the adult population, including depression, \nanxiety and post-traumatic stress, associated with gender and exposure to traumatic \nevents.13,14 No systematic survey has yet focused on young people, although an unpublished \nUNICEF study in 1997 reported that 90% of 300 children interviewed in Kabul believed they \nwould die in the war, while 80% said they were sad, frightened, and unable to cope with \nlife.15  Conversely, a qualitative study led by Save The Children (2003), involving 437 \nchildren and adult carers in Kabul, sought to dispel the notion that the majority of young \nAfghans were \u201ctraumatized by their experiences of conflict.\u201d16\nWe conducted the first large-scale survey of child mental health, in three areas of \nAfghanistan.  In order to assess mental health and life adversity from multiple viewpoints, we \nfeatured interviews with children, caregivers and teachers; for this reason, we situated the \nstudy in schools.  The education sector has significantly expanded since the fall of the Taliban \n(2001) and the \u201cBack to School\u201d campaign beginning in 2002: a large number of government-\nsponsored schools have opened, ranging from lyc\u00e9e to Islamic madrassa, catering for girls as \nwell as boys in primary and secondary-level education.  While full census data exist only for \n1979, national surveys reported that 64% of 7-14 year-olds (girls, 48%; boys, 77%) attended \nschool in 2004-05;17 school attendance is rapidly growing in central and northern \n3Afghanistan, given a relatively stable governance after a long period of civil war.  Particularly \nin Kabul, educational institutions hardly cope with the influx of students: most teach two \nshifts per day and many hold classes in outdoor tents as well as classrooms.  We found \nschools to be the best point of contact for drawing a community-level sample because they \nprovided an appropriate context for research activities, ensured the safety of the field team, \nand enabled the delivery of a complex field protocol.  We could not overcome formidable \nbarriers (affecting rapport and interview privacy) to a systematic sampling of out-of-school \nchildren. We targeted 11-16 year-olds, to allow respondents to articulate for themselves views \nabout adversity, health and social functioning.  Our baseline study thus speaks to the needs of \nchildren able to attend school and old enough to evaluate their experiences.\nAn integrative approach has been advocated in the Lancet to bridge medical and social \nunderstandings of trauma, post-traumatic stress and psychological impairment in the wake of \nwar.18 In line with this approach, we provide an epidemiological profile of child mental health \nand an analysis of events reported as trauma. With screening instruments, we examined the \nnature of mental health problems, testing specific associations with gender, traumatic events, \ncaregiver mental health, and socio-demographic characteristics.  From respondent accounts \ncollected during implementation of a checklist, we examined the exposure to and nature of \ntrauma events.\nMETHODS\nStudy Design\nIn 2006 (May-December), we conducted a two-stage, school-based cross-sectional \nsurvey, interviewing 11-16 year-old students, their primary caregivers, and classroom \nteachers (Figure 1).  To capture a range of historical, social and economic experiences, we \npurposively selected three research sites (Kabul, Bamyan and Mazar-e-Sharif municipalities) \nin central\/northern Afghanistan, excluding for security reasons areas in the south\/southeast.  \nWe built upon extensive experience: surveys in Wardak province (2004) where schools could \nnot be randomly selected, and in Afghan refugee camps of Pakistan (2005) where the protocol \nwas successful, allowing us to perfect rapport-building strategies and test instrument \nreliability.  \n[Figure 1]\nWe adopted a stratified random sampling design.  Because school records were not \ncentrally available, exhaustive lists of all state-operated schools (n=257 in the 3 areas), with \nsize of student population, had to be obtained from local administrative offices.  In stage 1, \n4we drew a random sample of 25 schools (10% of those listed), with probability sampling \nproportional to size, and additional stratification in Kabul across its 16 educational zones to \nachieve spread across city areas.  To provide balanced geographical and gender coverage, we \nselected 8-9 schools per research site, with equal numbers of boy\/girl schools (we drew a total \nof 14 single-sex schools and 11 co-educational schools).  For each participating school, we \nenlisted teachers to compile up-to-date, age-specific class lists for grades 5-10, which cater for \n11-16 year olds - due to curtailed education under the Taliban, a single grade includes a wide \nage-range of students.  In stage 2, we drew a random sample of students, selecting a minimum \nof 40 participants from each school (20 boys\/20 girls from co-educational schools, which hold \nseparate am\/pm shifts for boys\/girls).  Our sample (n=1,011) represented 5% of all students in \ntarget grades.\nWe aimed for 290 participants per area, given power calculations based on pilot work \nusing identical instruments with 11-16 year-old Afghan school-children, caregivers and \nteachers (\u03b1=.05, 95% CI, two-sided test to detect a 5% difference in prevalence rates for \nprimary outcomes).  Our target sample was 15% above this number.  Rapport was developed \nby initiating school-based activities prior to survey, offering small, locally-appropriate gifts to \nrespondents (e.g. refreshment\/notebook) and schools (e.g. heater\/water cooler) and health \nchecks on nutritional status and blood pressure (but not medical care) as gestures of goodwill. \nAll selected students agreed to participate: they were eager to be interviewed because of the \nnovelty of our research activity.  Caregivers (adults with direct responsibility for the child) \nwere recruited through the students - they included male\/female parents or other relatives, \nreflecting the strict gender segregation of daily life and the role of extended families in \nchildcare.  To realize 40 multi-informant interviews per school within a 10 day-period\/school, \nwe contacted 1,260 students, met with 1,021 caregivers (81%), and interviewed 1,020 within \nthe allocated time; only one father refused to participate.  If a caregiver did not come to the \nschool, we could not obtain informed consent, and therefore did not interview the child. \nTeachers repeatedly asked us why all students could not be included; as a matter of courtesy, \nwe did interview (but excluded from the dataset) a handful of keen volunteers, unselected by \nrandom procedures.  \nA small team of well-trained researchers moved sequentially from school to school -\nthis maximized data quality\/comparability and rapport\/participation.  Suitable interviewers \nwere recruited from a pool of previously experienced researchers, and given three weeks\u2019 \nfield training by the senior academics and project manager. Training included interview \ntechniques sensitive to gender, ethnicity and age differentials, as well as measuring health \n5status; blood pressure measurements helped establish rapport with participants, as high\/low \nblood pressure is a local idiom for being agitated\/depressed.  Three male and three female\nstaff (fluent in Dari\/Pashto) were contracted for 8 months, to interview students, caregivers \nand teachers \u2013 in face-to-face, private encounters, on school premises.  One professional \ntranslator handled all verbatim data.  An Afghan medical doctor helped with health \nchecks\/referrals.  Two Afghan clinical psychologists were involved in piloting and review of \ninstruments, but could not be retained for the duration of survey.  The project manager, fluent \nin English and local languages, liaised with schools, explained the research to participants, \nchecked completed questionnaires daily and verified translations of verbatim data.  Other \nauthors were on-site during staff training, instrument pre-testing and review, data collection, \ntranslation and evaluation.  Protocol was approved by Durham University, the Ministry of \nEducation in Kabul, its subsidiary departments in Kabul, Bamyan and Mazar-e-Sharif, and all \nschool directors; informed consent was obtained from parents\/guardians first, then from \nchildren and class teachers, in verbal form.\nInstruments\nWe used multiple screening tools for child\/adult mental health (Figure 2). Instruments \nwere chosen on the basis of simplicity, reliability, good psychometric properties for the target \nage-group19 and extensive usage as research tools in schools and low-income\/conflict\/disaster \nsettings (e.g., in Gaza, Bosnia, Bangladesh and Pakistan; Table for online publication). Where \nno clinical revalidation has been possible, such tools effectively screen for likely\nchild\/adolescent mental health disorders and\/or distress symptomology.  An Afghan clinical \npsychologist, with professional experience in Afghanistan and Britain, translated instruments\nfrom English to Dari and Pashto.  Independently of each other, one professional translator and \none linguist undertook blind back-translations.  Both sets of translations and back-translations \nwere systematically reviewed for content validity, by an Afghan group of bi\/trilingual \nfieldworkers\/academic staff with expertise in social work, anthropology and clinical \npsychology, then vetted by Western experts in psychology\/psychiatry. Three extensive pilots,\nincluding measurement (test-retest) reliability, were conducted in a range of Afghan \ncommunities (Wardak, Peshawar, Kabul). These steps conform to procedures advocated for \ninstruments used in transcultural research.20\n[Figure 2] [Table for online publication]\nThe Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was implemented with students, \nprimary caregivers and main classroom teachers, to identify children for whom a psychiatric \ndisorder is \u2018unlikely\u2019, \u2018possible\u2019, or \u2018probable.\u2019  The SDQ is a simple and effective screening \n6tool providing balanced coverage of behavioural, emotional and social problems,21,22 which \ncan be self-completed by children aged 11+.   Its four sub-scales - emotional, behavioural,\nhyperactive and peer problems, reflecting ICD-10 and DSM-IV criteria - yield a total score \nfor mental health \u201cdifficulties;\u201d a fifth sub-scale taps \u201cstrengths\u201d or prosocial behaviour; \nsupplementary questions measure the impact of a child\u2019s difficulties (rated by multiple \nrespondents) for home, classroom, social, and leisure activities.  Notably, the SDQ predicts \npsychiatric disorder on the basis of both symptoms and impact on social functioning and can \ntriangulate ratings across informants, which better predicts mental health disorders than \ninformation from just one source.23,24 Single-informant SDQ ratings have been used and \nvalidated in Bangladesh,25 Pakistan,26,27 the Yemen28 and Gaza.29  A multi-informant \ncategorization of children30 is generated by a computerized algorithm predicting that probable \ndisorders are present where symptom scores exceed 95th centiles and impact scores are \ndefinite or severe (http:\/\/www.sdqscore.net). It has been validated in Britain and \nBangladesh,25,30 and shown to work equally well in both settings. We developed SDQ \nversions in Dari and Pashto (now copyrighted, see www.sdqinfo.com).\nTwo other instruments were administered to students. The Birleson Depression Self-\nRating Scale (DSRS) is a brief screening tool (18 items, 3-point scale) for child depressive \nsymptoms,31 which discriminates effectively between severely and non-severely depressed \nchildren, although various cut-off points are used in the literature.  The Child Revised Impact \nof Events Scale (CRIES-13 items, 4-point scale) measures the impact of traumatic \nexperiences; scores of 17+ for combined intrusion\/ avoidance symptoms indicate a level of \ndistress consistent with post-traumatic stress (i.e. PTSD-like symptoms).32 We developed \nDSRS and CRIES versions in Dari and Pashto for the Children and War Foundation \n(www.childrenandwar.org).\nFor caregiver mental health, we used two instruments validated for Afghanistan.33-35\nThe Self-Reported Questionnaire (SRQ-20 items, yes\/no responses) is an international \ninstrument recommended for epidemiological research in low-income countries.33,36  The\nAfghan Symptom Checklist (ASCL 23-items, 5-point scale) was developed specifically in \nKabul, to measure psychological distress using culturally-specific terminology.34,35  \nWith both children and caregivers, we implemented a Traumatic Events Checklist\n(TEC) adapted from the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire37 and Gaza Traumatic Event \nChecklist.38 Our review panel selected twenty (yes\/no) items covering a range of events \npertinent to Afghanistan, differentiating, where appropriate, direct experience from witnessing \nor hearing reports of an event, plus one yes\/no item to allow for \u2018any other\u2019 traumatic \n7experience.  Two additional items collected information on which lifetime event had been the \nmost distressing (among those reported), and when it had occurred.  All participants were \ngiven the time and opportunity to explain responses in depth, allowing for contextualisation of \nmeaning, time and place regarding all items reported. Interviewers recorded statements \nverbatim.  For students, we implemented CRIES in relation to the event reported as most \ndistressing.\nSociodemographic data (e.g., displacement, economic status, education level, \nhousehold characteristics) were collected from caregivers. We featured different markers of \nfinancial security, including a material wealth index (MWI) based on household ownership of \n15 pre-specified items. Other data (health checks; interviews on aspirations and social \nenvironment) are not here reported.\nAnalyses\nFollowing the literature, we used binary SDQ outcomes (probable vs. possible\/\nunlikely psychiatric disorder), using a standard algorithm based on multi-informant ratings of \nsymptoms + impact scores.24,25 We also used binary outcomes (CRIES 17+) to evaluate\ncurrent psychological impact of the most (if any) distressing item reported.  We used the full \nrange of scores for other outcomes (DSRS, SRQ-20 and ASCL), to show results per unit \nincrease (additional symptom reported on a dimensional scale), rather than arbitrary or \ndisputed thresholds to discriminate poor\/high mental health.33 Psychometric scales \ndemonstrated very good internal reliability (Cronbach\u2019s alpha >.74 for child and >.84 for \nadult outcomes).  \n               We tested associations between 3 main outcomes (SDQ and CRIES with logistic \nregression, DSRS with linear regression) and 11 a priori risk factors: gender, exposure to \ntrauma, residence area, ethnicity, caregiver mental health, type of caregiver, child\/parental \neducation, age, displacement history, material wealth, and household demographic \ncomposition.  We then built multivariate models (informed by a priori hypotheses and \nunivariate analyses) with 5 predictor variables in the following order: gender, traumatic \nevents, caregiver mental health, residence area, child age.  We excluded other variables (e.g., \nwealth, education) and potential effect modification (interaction with gender, age, or wealth), \nwhich had no significant impact on mental health outcomes. We present regression models \nwith all 5 predictors to facilitate comparison across multiple outcomes (Table 2).  Statistical \nanalyses were adjusted for within-school gender distribution and clustering by school and area\n(using STATA 8.2); this accounts for the probability of selecting boys and girls in \nparticipating schools, as well as common variance within the clusters, producing robust \n8standard errors and conservative estimates for group comparisons. Sensitivity analyses using \nlinear or categorical data (e.g., for trauma events) yielded similar findings. \nWe analysed reports of trauma in terms of exposure to and nature of events.  For \nmultivariate analysis, we examined the total number of events reported and 4 categories of \nexposure (0, 1-2, 3-4, 5+ events).  For purposes of presentation, we grouped the 21 yes\/no \nTrauma Event Checklist items into 6 types of events: severe physical injury, witnessed severe \nviolence on another person, death\/disappearance of a close relative, being in a combat zone, \nforced displacement from home, and \u2018other\u2019 event.  This categorization was done for all \nreported events (Figure 3) and the most distressing lifetime event (Figure 4).  For the latter, \nwe systematically reviewed respondent statements about the specific trauma reported. \nContent analysis of these verbatim descriptions,39 transcribed and reviewed manually by the \nresearch team in both English and vernacular languages, was used to categorize these reports \ninto sub-types of traumatic experience. These sub-types are shown in Figure 4 for three of six \nmain categories, in order to illustrate the range of events reported.  Thematic analysis of \nrespondent narratives will be published elsewhere.\nFINDINGS\nSample socio-demographic characteristics\nOur sample had equal gender representation across study sites.  It included 1011\nstudents, 1011 primary caregivers, and each child\u2019s main classroom teacher (Figure 1). \nCaregivers included mothers (37.6%), fathers (24.5%), and close female (12.7%) or male \n(25.2%) relatives (aunts\/uncles, grandparents, older siblings).  The dataset excluded 9 cases \nwith missing variables of interest.\nStudents averaged 13.5 (SD 1.6) years of age, and 5.7 years (SD 1.9) of formal \neducation.  Eight in ten (82.7%) had been displaced due to conflict and\/or economic reasons,\nincluding 45.1% displaced three or more times (data not shown).  One in ten children was \norphaned from one or both parents. Two in ten worked outside of school hours.  Unpaid work \nincluded service in market stalls or family-owned restaurants; paid work ranged from \npeddling goods, weaving carpets, and working as apprentices \u2013 the latter earning boys less \nthan 50 pence a week.  Most households (59.4%) were rated as very poor\/poor, being unable \nto feed, shelter and\/or clothe family members adequately.  They averaged 5.6 (SD 3.2) MWI\nitems: 52.6% had a piped water supply, 76.7% a radio and 52.8% a mobile phone.  Most \nmothers (72.6%) and 39% of fathers had no formal education.\n9Mental health outcomes\nThe proportion of students meeting criteria for a probable psychiatric disorder (22.2%, \n[CI 19.6,24.7]; Table 1) was twice the \u2018expectable\u2019 rate for this age-group,40 as predicted from \nmulti-informant SDQ ratings based on symptoms and social functioning. Gender differences \nwere pronounced for \u2018any\u2019 predicted psychiatric disorder, for emotional disorders, and for \ndepression, with girls exhibiting higher levels than boys (Table 2; all p<.0001).  No\nsignificant gender differences were observed for CRIES, with 23.9% [21.3,26.6] of students \nexhibiting strong feelings of intrusion\/anxiety indicative of post-traumatic stress.  All \nmeasures of child mental health and social functioning were significantly associated, \nindicating agreement across multiple informants and different measures (correlations not \nshown).  There were also strong, multiple associations between child and caregiver mental\nhealth (e.g., p<.0001 between multi-informant SDQ ratings for the child and caregiver SRQ-\n20).  These remained highly significant after disaggregating by type and gender of caregiver.\n[Table 1]\nRisk correlates of mental health\nFour variables independently predicted SDQ ratings: female gender, exposure to \nmultiple traumatic events, caregiver\u2019s symptoms of poor mental health, and residence in \nKabul (Table 2).  The same variables associated with symptoms of depression.  As for \nCRIES, no associations were found with gender or residence area, only with number of \ntraumatic events, caregiver mental health, and age of child. Material wealth and \npaternal\/maternal education had no impact on child outcomes. The same results were obtained \nfrom analyses based on the culturally-specific ASCL instead of SRQ-20 for caregiver data.\n[Table 2]\nTwo risk factors, trauma exposure and caregiver mental health, were present across all \nthree measures of child mental health. Exposure to 5+ traumatic events was clearly strongly \npredictive of poor outcomes (SDQ, OR=3.07 [1.78,5.30]; DSRS, \u03b2=1.73 [0.70,2.77]; CRIES, \nOR=3.07 [1.78,5.30]).  In particular, CRIES intrusion\/avoidance scores showed a dose-\nresponse effect (with odds ratios increasing for 3-4 and 5+ events).  The influence of \ncaregiver mental health was also consistent, albeit modest, as shown per additional symptom \nreported (SDQ, OR=1.11 [1.08,1.14]; DSRS, \u03b2=0.07 [0.01, 0.13]; CRIES, OR=1.06 [1.02, \n1.09]).  Other variables were significant for just one or two outcomes.  Thus gender predicted \nSDQ ratings (OR=2.47 [1.65,3.68]) and symptoms of depression (\u03b2=0.86 [0.24,1.48]), but not \nCRIES.\n10\nTraumatic events\nTwo-thirds of all children (63.5% [60.5,66.5]) reported experiencing at least one \ntraumatic event (Figure 3) and 8.4% [6.7,10.1] reported exposure to 5+ events.  There were no \ngender differences by category of traumatic experiences (except forced displacement, \np<.036). \n[Figure 3; Figure 4]\nChildren\u2019s most distressing lifetime trauma was clearly related to violence: this \nencompassed injury, witnessing violence on another person, reporting the death\/\ndisappearance of close relatives, being in a combat zone, and forced displacement (Figure 4).  \nIn the first category (injury), children reported serious accidents, severe beatings by relatives \nor neighbours, frightening medical treatments, and painful illnesses without medical care; \nonly 4 respondents mentioned war-related events such as landmine injury. The second \ncategory (witnessing violence) included war-related events (summary executions\/beatings \nduring Taliban rule, deaths from rocket explosions, mutilated\/dead bodies), but also \ncommunity-level and domestic violence.  The deaths\/losses of close relatives reported in the \nthird category were primarily related to war, but also included accidents and criminal acts. \nThe lifetime events reported as most distressing included both past and ongoing exposure to \nviolence, during the Taliban period and after the fall of their regime (2001).  Remarkably, \nmany children escaped the burden of traumatic experiences, either reporting no exposure at all \n(36.5%) or exhibiting little psychological sequelae (CRIES scores) to adverse life events.  \nDISCUSSION\nThis is the first school-based survey of child mental health conducted in Afghanistan, \nyielding systematic data on 11-16 year old students in three central\/northern areas.  We \nprovide evidence for several risk correlates: female gender, traumatic events, caregiver mental \nhealth, and residence area.  We situate these findings in the wider literature, before stating \nstudy limitations and implications.\nEvaluation\nGender differences in emotional problems for adolescents are well-known across \ncultures.22,23  In this sample, girls showed a two-fold risk for predicted psychopathology \nrelative to boys, as well as higher symptoms of depression (Table 2).  A gender dimension to \npoor mental health, rigorously documented here for 11-16 year olds, is certainly pronounced \nfor Afghan adults13-14 reflecting the gender-based \u201cschism\u201d in social life.33  A more \nunexpected finding22 is the relative burden of emotional and behavioural problems for boys\n11\n(SDQ ratings for emotional disorders exceeded those for conduct disorders).  We found, \nhowever, no gender differences for symptoms indicative of post-traumatic stress (as measured \nby CRIES), in line with equivocal reports in the literature.41\n          Consistent with existing literature on war zones,3 exposure to traumatic events was \nstrongly associated with mental health outcomes.  Experiencing 5+ traumatic events trebled \nthe risk of likely psychiatric disorder and post-traumatic stress, also elevating depression \nsymptomology.  Traumatic reports were related to violence, but not necessarily to acts of war: \naccidents, painful medical treatments and beatings by close relatives or neighbours vastly \noutnumbered war-related events (landmine\/combat) among reports of severe physical injury.  \nThere was also significant exposure to ongoing, current adversity: thus children who had \nwitnessed relatives executed\/beaten by Taliban and mujahideen militia were still exposed to \nongoing community-level and domestic violence (e.g., the beating of their mother or sibling \nby male relatives). \nChild-caregiver associations were also consistent across multiple indicators of mental \nhealth status.  We presented these associations in terms of each additional symptom reported \nby caregivers on a 20-point symptom scale, rather than use SRQ-20 thresholds with disputed \nsignificance in the literature.33,42  Thus each symptom reported by caregivers increased the \nodds of multi-informant ratings for child psychiatric disorder by some 11%.  Results from \nanalyses using the culturally-specific instrument (ASCL) for caregiver mental health were \nexactly the same as those generated with the international instrument (SRQ-20; data not \nshown).  A small but significant impact was also recorded for depression and CRIES, per \nadditional caregiver symptom reported.  Associations between child-caregiver mental health \nhave not been previously reported for Afghanistan, but are consistent with the few studies on \nwar-affected adolescents which have been able to obtain parent\/child data.3 We suggest that \ncaregiver\u2019s mental health is linked to the wellbeing of younger generations under their care, a \nlikely result of the interdependence between family members and shared experiences of \nadversity.  \nThe greater burden of mental health problems in Kabul was an unexpected finding of \nthis survey, given that violent conflict is also etched in the social and political past of Bamyan \nand Mazar-e-Sharif communities.  Relative to the two other areas, Kabul children showed \nhigher rates of probable psychiatric disorder and elevated depression symptomology, but no \ndifferences in symptoms akin to post-traumatic stress.  Interestingly, residence in Kabul was \nalso a risk factor for adult caregivers (data not shown).  We relate area-specific findings to the \nmultiplicity of ongoing social and economic stressors in the capital,43,44 where overcrowding, \n12\nhigh living costs, widening inequalities, pressure on resources and day-to-day stressors may \ncompound other adversity directly related to war.45,46  This explanation, while plausible, needs \ninvestigation. \nAs highlighted in one review of psychiatric epidemiology: \u201cfactors other than war-\nrelated violence account for much of the psychological distress among people exposed to \narmed conflict\u201d \u2013 yet \u201csuffering related to poverty, displacement, poor health, spouse abuse, \nand social isolation simply does not draw the same level of international interest and concern \nas war-related trauma\u201d.35  Two large-scale surveys of adults in Afghanistan13,14 have linked a \nhigh prevalence of mental health problems with gender and exposure to traumatic events; yet, \nin both surveys, the most common trauma was \u2018lack of food\/water\u2019 and \u2018ill-health without \nmedical care.\u2019  In a handful of other studies, adult mental health for Afghans was associated \nwith day-to-day social stressors,43,44 poverty,42 and socioeconomic inequalities in access to \nhousing, social and health care.47 In our study, material wealth and education predicted mental \nhealth outcomes for adult caregivers (data not shown), but not for the children.  The one \nqualitative study focusing on children16 concluded that psychosocial wellbeing was largely \ninfluenced by daily stressors such as environmental threats (e.g., road conditions and traffic \naccidents).  Daily stressors are not to be conflated with traumatic experiences.  Yet in the \naftermath of war, the notion of \u2018trauma\u2019 overlaps with that of \u2018social suffering,\u2019 drawing \nsignificance from consequences in both medical and social domains. 48\n             This cautions against simplistic characterisations of trauma. In Afghanistan, there are \nboth spectacular and mundane forms of violence, ranging from armed insurgency to family \nconflict: both \u2018explosive\u2019 and \u2018everyday\u2019 violence, generating sudden pain and ongoing \nsuffering.  Our data suggest that, in Afghan children\u2019s lives, \u2018everyday\u2019 violence matters just \nas much as militarized violence in the recollection of traumatic experiences. As their most\ntraumatic lifetime experience, respondents identified a range of trauma events linked to \nphysical and social stressors with significant repercussions on family dynamics, safety and \nhealth (Figure 4).   Some children identified severe domestic beatings, a severe accident, or a \nfrightening medical treatment as trauma that was more salient than having witnessed first-\nhand the deaths of parents and grandparents killed in rocket attacks.  Conversely, others \nidentified as their most severe trauma the death of a relative killed in the distant past, rather \nthan recurrent distressing experiences of severe domestic beatings.  The selective \nprioritisation of a particular event does not mean that it is per se the root cause of mental \ndistress.7 However, it does suggest that children assign significance to war-related, \n13\ncommunity, and family-level traumatic events on the basis of their current life circumstances \nand needs.49\nEvidence of psychological suffering must be balanced, however, against evidence of \nfortitude and coping with adversity. Our survey data fall just within the expected range [CIs] \nfor emotional and behavioural disorders in children, namely an \u201coverall prevalence of 10-15% \n(\u2026) in children in the general population, which can increase up to 20% in regions of \nsocioeconomic adversity.\u201d50 Some 22.2% [19.6,24.7] of students met multi-informant SDQ \ncriteria for probable psychiatric rating, twice the rate (9.6%) found in British national school-\nbased surveys40 with the same methodology.  Students, as well as caregivers and teachers, \nreported many symptoms of mental health difficulties, but also rated their social functioning \npositively (across domains of home, classroom, social, and leisure activities).  By age 11-16, \nAfghans live in a society marked by ongoing, often multiple exposure to adverse and violent \nevents, affecting everyday personal and social experiences. In this study, 63.5% [60.5,66.5] of \nchild respondents reported exposure to traumatic events; 23.9% [21.3,26.6] exhibited \nsubstantial psychological distress in the wake of their most frightening lifetime event. As our \ndata reveal, experiencing 5+ traumatic events has striking consequences for mental health, but \nthere is some measure of resilience in negotiating the impact of 1-2 traumatic experiences\n(Table 2).  Other literature emphasises that war-affected adolescents can present both high \nsymptoms of psychopathology and competent social functioning,7,51 and that focusing on \nsymptoms, without examining social impact, leads to \u201cimplausibly high\u201d rates of mental \nhealth disorder.52\nLimitations\nThree limitations of the study are explicitly noted: sampling bias, respondent bias and \ninstrument diagnostic validity.  A sampling bias was introduced by purposively choosing \nthree geographical areas (not representative of the country overall) and failing to include \nchildren whose families could not, or chose not, to send them to school.  Our survey captured \na random sample of school-children, yielding the first dataset on a growing proportion of \nAfghan boys and girls attending state-sponsored schools.  Because non-school attending \nchildren may be at greater risk of mental health disorder,23  the sampling bias is likely to \nunderestimate relationships observed in our data.\nA known limitation of psychiatric research is that respondents have different \ncompetence and sensitivity when reporting mental health difficulties.23,24 Strict cultural \nprescriptions for gender segregation and assignment of responsibility for adolescent children \ninfluenced which caregiver came for interview (72% were fathers or male guardians in the \n14\ncase of boys, 73% were mothers or female guardians in the case of girls).  It is possible that\nfemale caregivers, who suffered poorer mental health than males, saw children in more \nnegative light, which would exaggerate gender-based associations between adult and child \nmental health. However, the study derives methodological strength from providing ratings on \nmental health difficulties and social impact across three informants (children, caregivers, \nteachers):40 this is hardly ever implemented in low-income or war-affected countries.23 It is \nalso possible that men and women were differentially inclined to report their distress or \naggravate their problems to signal a need for material assistance,53 although we paid careful \nattention to issues of communication, rapport, time and privacy.  \nWe used instruments shown to be useful and valid for screening purposes in a range of \nWestern\/non-Western cultures and low\/high income countries, but without clinical \nrevalidation in Afghanistan.  Our methodological strengths lie in the use of multiple \ninstruments, with attention paid to cross-cultural reliability and validity.20,54 The multi-\ninformant SDQ ratings go beyond a narrow focus on symptomology: they systematically \ninclude respondents\u2019 own evaluations of the functional and social significance of a child\u2019s \nmental health difficulties, in terms of causing distress and impairment in daily life. We are \nmindful of debates regarding the relevance of absolute thresholds for community-wide \nscreening across cultures33 and the important distinction between general psychological \ndistress (suffering) and severe mental health disorder (pathology).18,55 Rather than seeking to \nestablish prevalence rates for specific psychiatric disorders, we focus attention on risk factors\nfor mental health problems and psychological distress, and the robustness of findings across \nmultiple instruments.  \nImplications\nOur study demonstrates the feasibility and potential value of working in schools to \nidentify the nature and risk correlates of child mental health, using lay interviewers and brief \ninstruments.36  Our research was well-received; teachers remarked that they had not \npreviously reflected on the impact mental health difficulties could have for scholastic \nperformance and students commented that they had never previously been asked about their \nfeelings related to school and\/or home experiences.  In this socially conservative context, \nmany female caregivers had never been given the opportunity to visit the school or meet their \nchild\u2019s teacher.  Our study raised awareness of the importance of child mental health issues \nwithin school settings and suggests that school-based interventions would be well-received.  \nCommunity-level interventions, in the form of school-based mental health\nprogrammes, are nascent, localised initiatives in Afghanistan,43 but already advocated26 and \n15\nsuccessful56 in Pakistan and for children affected by political violence in the West \nBank\/Gaza57 and Indonesia.58 Policy support for public-health interventions1 to alleviate \ntrauma, mental health disorders and psychological distress is currently a priority12 for the \nAfghan government.  This is due to the acute shortage of qualified mental health care \npractitioners, the current level of provision of basic health and social services,59 and the \nchallenges of programming with youth.60 Emerging consensus advocates several layers of \nsupport for mental health programmes in emergency settings: those targeting the family and \ncommunity, as well as more specialist care for those in clinical need.5\nWe highlight two robust predictors of poor mental health outcomes for children: \nexposure to multiple trauma and caregiver mental health. The former predictor is consistent \nwith findings in the existing literature.  We draw attention, however, to the significance of \neveryday violence and trauma which is not narrowly focused on war.  This serves to broaden\nunderstanding of trauma and place it in the context of \u2018everyday\u2019 forms of suffering, violence \nand adversity.  The consistent, albeit modest, parent-child associations for mental health \noutcomes point to psychosocial suffering being embedded in household dynamics and shared \nadverse experiences. The simple but powerful conclusion of a meta-review of cross-cultural \npsychiatric research rings true for Afghan society: \u201cthe key to giving young people a good \nstart in life is to help their parents.\u201d1 Our findings lend support to interventions which address \nmental health issues at family and community-level, framing policies to strengthen whole \nfamily units and enhance their access to basic social, health and educational services.5,12\nConflict of interest statement: There is no conflict of interest.  \nSponsor: the Wellcome Trust [073305].  \nContributors:  XXX and XXX co-wrote the paper and evaluated all data, with input from \nother investigators.

Children\nLikelihood of psychiatric disorder\nStrength and \nDifficulties \nQuestionnaire \n(SDQ)\nChildren, \ncaregivers, \nteachers \n(about the \nchild)\nTranslated in over 47 languages; used as a research tool in developmental, social, \nclinical and educational studies; validated for 11-16 year olds, in clinic and community \nsettings in both Western and non-Western cultures,1,2 including national surveys in \nBritain,3 Brazil4 and Russia,5 and specific surveys to establish mental health profiles in \nBangladesh,6 Pakistan,7 Yemen1,8 and Gaza.9  Performs as well as the Child Behaviour \nChecklist, while being much briefer.10  A computerized\/paper-and-pencil algorithm6,11\ntriangulates ratings from multiple informants (child, caregiver, teacher) on symptoms \nof mental health difficulties and impact on social life, to compute prevalence rates of \noverall caseness (unlikely\/possible\/probable psychiatric disorder) and types of disorder \n(emotional, behaviour, hyperkinetic).10  The SDQ offers several key advantages as a \nclinical and research screening tool: it is brief, comprehensive of the range of child and \nadolescent disorders, simple in administration and scoring, and psychometrically \nevaluated in a wide range of cultures. 1,2  The robusteness, predictive power and \nvalidity of individual SDQ ratings and multi-informant algorithm, in terms of likely \nclinical diagnosis, are well demonstrated in the UK,6 Bangladesh,6,11 Pakistan,7,12 the \nYemen8 and Gaza9 for 11-16 year olds. In the last 10 years, the SDQ has been used \nextensively as a screening tool to determine prevalence rates and risk factors for mental \nSupplementary Material\n2health assessment.\nDepression\nBirleson \nDepression \nSelf-Rating \nScale (DSRS)\nChildren \n(about self)\nImplemented to obtain normative data in school-based surveys across cultures, and \nmore specifically evaluate depression for children in communities afflicted by war in \nUK13 and Bosnia-Hercegovina,14-17 routine community-level violence18 or specific \ntraumatic events.19  The scale has good face and factorial validity14 for use in 9-14 year \nolds across cultures.  Studies variously use continuous or dichotomised scores to \nidentify risk factors for likely clinical depression;15  cut-off points have varied between \n13 and 17 to differentiate between severely and non-severely depressed children, with a \nthreshold of 15 offering good specificity and sensitivity in terms of clinical \ndiagnosis.11,20,21  This instrument has been used in conjunction with SDQ and CRIES in \nmany studies, for example in UK13 and Bosnia-Hercegovina.14,15\nPTSD-like symptoms of intrusion\/avoidance\nChild Revised \nImpact of \nEvents Scale \n(CRIES-13)\nChildren \n(who \nreported at \nleast one \ntraumatic \nevent)\nImpact of event scales have been widely implemented with adolescents affected by \nwar, community violence, chaotic or catastrophic events. CRIES was used in \nCambodia,22 Bosnia-Herzegovina23 and Iraq,24 as well as with young refugees to \nWestern countries.13 It demonstrates satisfactory internal consistency and excellent \nvalidity where cross-validated with other diagnostic interviews.22  For screening \npurposes, the Children and War Foundation recommended a total score of 17+ on the \nCRIES-13 intrusion and avoidance sub-scales, indicating high probability that the child \nwould obtain a diagnosis of PTSD.14\n3B.

We conducted the first-ever survey of 11-16 year olds.\nMethods: In 2006, we interviewed a cluster sample of 1011 children, their caregivers and \nteachers, randomly sampled in 25 government-operated schools within three purposively \nchosen areas.  For students, we administered the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire \n(SDQ) to predict likely psychiatric disorder from multi-informant ratings; the Depression \nSelf-Rating Scale; and an Impact of Events Scale.  For caregivers, we used both international \nand culturally-specific screening instruments (Self-Reported Questionnaire; Afghan Symptom \nChecklist).  We implemented a Checklist of Traumatic Events to examine the exposure to and \nnature of traumatic experiences.\nFindings:  Two risk factors, trauma exposure and caregiver mental health, were present \nacross all child outcomes.  SDQ ratings were associated with female gender \n(OR=2.47[1.65,3.68]), 5+ traumatic events (OR=2.58[1.36,4.90]), caregiver mental health \n(OR=1.11[1.08,1.14]), and residence areas (ORs=0.29[0.17,0.51] and OR=0.37[0.23,0.57] vs. \nKabul as reference).  The same variables predicted depressive symptoms. Two-thirds of \nchildren reported traumatic experiences.  Symptoms of post-traumatic stress were associated \nwith 5+ events (OR=3.07[1.78,5.30]), caregiver mental health (OR=1.06[1.02,26.6]) and child \nage (OR=1.19[1.04,1.36].  Children\u2019s most distressing trauma included accidents, medical \ntreatment, domestic and community-level violence, as well as war-related events.\nInterpretation: Young Afghans experience ongoing exposure to violence, which is not \nnarrowly confined to war-related events. The study highlights the potential value of school-\nbased initiatives to address child mental health, and the importance of understanding trauma\nin the context of \u2018everyday\u2019 forms of suffering, violence and adversity.\nWord count (text only): 5,379 5,359\n* Manuscript with revisions highlighted\n2INTRODUCTION\nChild and adolescent mental health sits high on the international public health \nagenda.1 According to researchers working in conflict zones, however, there is still \u201ca serious \ndearth of systematic empirical information\u201d on war-affected and displaced youth.2,3 The \nliterature shows an overwhelming focus on identifying traumatic stress and other negative \nsequelae of war, to a point where calls have been made to identify factors underlying \nvulnerability and resilience to social and economic upheaval in the wake of war,4,5 rather than \njust confirm the obvious - that \u201cwar is bad for children.\u201d6 Current research and policy \ninitiatives in conflict and disaster settings also seek to broaden the evidence base, through \nexamining a fuller range of psycho-social dimensions of mental health. 7-9 The literature \nhighlights crucial gaps in research, policy and practice regarding war-affected children10 and \ndemands rigorous research to inform a broader understanding of psychosocial wellbeing and \nmental health. In this context, a child-focused assessment of trauma, suffering and social \nfunctioning is vital.  \nAfghanistan has endured a combination of armed conflict, widespread poverty and \nsocial injustice.  State education and healthcare systems have been severely crippled, as were \ncommunity networks of social support.11,12 Previous large-scale surveys have documented a \nbroad spectrum of mental health problems in the adult population, including depression, \nanxiety and post-traumatic stress, associated with gender and exposure to traumatic \nevents.13,14 No systematic survey has yet focused on young people, although an unpublished \nUNICEF study in 1997 reported that 90% of 300 children interviewed in Kabul believed they \nwould die in the war, while 80% said they were sad, frightened, and unable to cope with \nlife.15  Conversely, a qualitative study led by Save The Children (2003), involving 437 \nchildren and adult carers in Kabul, sought to dispel the notion that the majority of young \nAfghans were \u201ctraumatized by their experiences of conflict.\u201d16\nWe conducted the first large-scale survey of child mental health, in three areas of \nAfghanistan.  In order to assess mental health and life adversity from multiple viewpoints, we \nfeatured interviews with children, caregivers and teachers; for this reason, we situated the \nstudy in schools.  The education sector has significantly expanded since the fall of the Taliban \n(2001) and the \u201cBack to School\u201d campaign beginning in 2002: a large number of government-\nsponsored schools have opened, ranging from lyc\u00e9e to Islamic madrassa, catering for girls as \nwell as boys in primary and secondary-level education.  While full census data exist only for \n1979, national surveys reported that 64% of 7-14 year-olds (girls, 48%; boys, 77%) attended \nschool in 2004-05;17 school attendance is rapidly growing in central and northern \n3Afghanistan, given a relatively stable governance after a long period of civil war.  Particularly \nin Kabul, educational institutions hardly cope with the influx of students: most teach two \nshifts per day and many hold classes in outdoor tents as well as classrooms.  We found \nschools to be the best point of contact for drawing a community-level sample because they \nprovided an appropriate context for research activities, ensured the safety of the field team, \nand enabled the delivery of a complex field protocol.  We could not overcome formidable \nbarriers (affecting rapport and interview privacy) to a systematic sampling of out-of-school \nchildren. We targeted 11-16 year-olds, to allow respondents to articulate for themselves views \nabout adversity, health and social functioning.  Our baseline study thus speaks to the needs of \nchildren able to attend school and old enough to evaluate their experiences.\nAn integrative approach has been advocated in the Lancet to bridge medical and social \nunderstandings of trauma, post-traumatic stress and psychological impairment in the wake of \nwar.18 In line with this approach, we provide an epidemiological profile of child mental health \nand an analysis of events reported as trauma. With screening instruments, we examined the \nnature of mental health problems, testing specific associations with gender, traumatic events, \ncaregiver mental health, and socio-demographic characteristics.  From respondent accounts \ncollected during implementation of a checklist, we examined the exposure to and nature of \ntrauma events.\nMETHODS\nStudy Design\nIn 2006 (May-December), we conducted a two-stage, school-based cross-sectional \nsurvey, interviewing 11-16 year-old students, their primary caregivers, and classroom \nteachers (Figure 1).  To capture a range of historical, social and economic experiences, we \npurposively selected three research sites (Kabul, Bamyan and Mazar-e-Sharif municipalities) \nin central\/northern Afghanistan, excluding for security reasons areas in the south\/southeast.  \nWe built upon extensive experience: surveys in Wardak province (2004) where schools could \nnot be randomly selected, and in Afghan refugee camps of Pakistan (2005) where the protocol \nwas successful, allowing us to perfect rapport-building strategies and test instrument \nreliability.  \n[Figure 1]\nWe adopted a stratified random sampling design.  Because school records were not \ncentrally available, exhaustive lists of all state-operated schools (n=257 in the 3 areas), with \nsize of student population, had to be obtained from local administrative offices.  In stage 1, \n4we drew a random sample of 25 schools (10% of those listed), with probability sampling \nproportional to size, and additional stratification in Kabul across its 16 educational zones to \nachieve spread across city areas.  To provide balanced geographical and gender coverage, we \nselected 8-9 schools per research site, with equal numbers of boy\/girl schools (we drew a total\nof 14 single-sex schools and 11 co-educational schools).  For each participating school, we \nenlisted teachers to compile up-to-date, age-specific class lists for grades 5-10, which cater for \n11-16 year olds - due to curtailed education under the Taliban, a single grade includes a wide \nage-range of students.  In stage 2, we drew a random sample of students, selecting a minimum \nof 40 participants from each school (20 boys\/20 girls from co-educational schools, which hold \nseparate am\/pm shifts for boys\/girls).  Our sample (n=1,011) represented 5% of all students in \ntarget grades.\nWe aimed for 290 participants per area, given power calculations based on pilot work \nusing identical instruments with 11-16 year-old Afghan school-children, caregivers and \nteachers (\u03b1=.05, 95% CI, two-sided test to detect a 5% difference in prevalence rates for \nprimary outcomes).  Our target sample was 15% above this number.  Rapport was developed \nby initiating school-based activities prior to survey, offering small, locally-appropriate gifts to \nrespondents (e.g. refreshment\/notebook) and schools (e.g. heater\/water cooler) and health \nchecks on nutritional status and blood pressure (but not medical care) as gestures of goodwill. \nAll selected students agreed to participate: they were eager to be interviewed because of the \nnovelty of our research activity.  Caregivers (adults with direct responsibility for the child) \nwere recruited through the students - they included male\/female parents or other relatives, \nreflecting the strict gender segregation of daily life and the role of extended families in \nchildcare.  To realize 40 multi-informant interviews per school within a 10 day-period\/school, \nwe contacted 1,260 students, met with 1,021 caregivers (81%), and interviewed 1,020 within \nthe allocated time; only one father refused to participate.  If a caregiver did not come to the \nschool, we could not obtain informed consent, and therefore did not interview the child. \nTeachers repeatedly asked us why all students could not be included; as a matter of courtesy, \nwe did interview (but excluded from the dataset) a handful of keen volunteers, unselected by \nrandom procedures.  \nA small team of well-trained researchers moved sequentially from school to school -\nthis maximized data quality\/comparability and rapport\/participation.  Suitable interviewers \nwere recruited from a pool of previously experienced researchers, and given three weeks\u2019 \nfield training by the senior academics and project manager. Training included interview \ntechniques sensitive to gender, ethnicity and age differentials, as well as measuring health \n5status; blood pressure measurements helped establish rapport with participants, as high\/low \nblood pressure is a local idiom for being agitated\/depressed.  Three male and three female\nstaff (fluent in Dari\/Pashto) were contracted for 8 months, to interview students, caregivers \nand teachers \u2013 in face-to-face, private encounters, on school premises.  One professional \ntranslator handled all verbatim data.  An Afghan medical doctor helped with health \nchecks\/referrals.  Two Afghan clinical psychologists were involved in piloting and review of \ninstruments, but could not be retained for the duration of survey.  The project manager, fluent \nin English and local languages, liaised with schools, explained the research to participants, \nchecked completed questionnaires daily and verified translations of verbatim data.  Other \nauthors were on-site during staff training, instrument pre-testing and review, data collection, \ntranslation and evaluation.  Protocol was approved by Durham University, the Ministry of \nEducation in Kabul, its subsidiary departments in Kabul, Bamyan and Mazar-e-Sharif, and all \nschool directors; informed consent was obtained from parents\/guardians first, then from \nchildren and class teachers, in verbal form.\nInstruments\nWe used multiple screening tools for child\/adult mental health (Figure 2). Instruments \nwere chosen on the basis of simplicity, reliability, good psychometric properties for the target \nage-group19 and extensive usage as research tools in schools and low-income\/conflict\/disaster \nsettings (e.g., in Gaza, Bosnia, Bangladesh and Pakistan; Table for online publication). Where \nno clinical revalidation has been possible, such tools effectively screen for likely\nchild\/adolescent mental health disorders and\/or distress symptomology.  An Afghan clinical \npsychologist, with professional experience in Afghanistan and Britain, translated instruments\nfrom English to Dari and Pashto.  Independently of each other, one professional translator and \none linguist undertook blind back-translations.  Both sets of translations and back-translations \nwere systematically reviewed for content validity, by an Afghan group of bi\/trilingual \nfieldworkers\/academic staff with expertise in social work, anthropology and clinical \npsychology, then vetted by Western experts in psychology\/psychiatry. Three extensive pilots,\nincluding measurement (test-retest) reliability, were conducted in a range of Afghan \ncommunities (Wardak, Peshawar, Kabul). These steps conform to procedures advocated for \ninstruments used in transcultural research.20\n[Figure 2] [Table for online publication]\nThe Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was implemented with students, \nprimary caregivers and main classroom teachers, to identify children for whom a psychiatric \ndisorder is \u2018unlikely\u2019, \u2018possible\u2019, or \u2018probable.\u2019  The SDQ is a simple and effective screening \n6tool providing balanced coverage of behavioural, emotional and social problems,21,22 which \ncan be self-completed by children aged 11+.   Its four sub-scales - emotional, behavioural,\nhyperactive and peer problems, reflecting ICD-10 and DSM-IV criteria - yield a total score \nfor mental health \u201cdifficulties;\u201d a fifth sub-scale taps \u201cstrengths\u201d or prosocial behaviour; \nsupplementary questions measure the impact of a child\u2019s difficulties (rated by multiple \nrespondents) for home, classroom, social, and leisure activities.  Notably, the SDQ predicts \npsychiatric disorder on the basis of both symptoms and impact on social functioning and can \ntriangulate ratings across informants, which better predicts mental health disorders than \ninformation from just one source.23,24 Single-informant SDQ ratings have been used and \nvalidated in Bangladesh,25 Pakistan,26,27 the Yemen28 and Gaza.29  A multi-informant \ncategorization of children30 is generated by a computerized algorithm predicting that probable \ndisorders are present where symptom scores exceed 95th centiles and impact scores are \ndefinite or severe (http:\/\/www.sdqscore.net). It has been validated in Britain and \nBangladesh,25,30 and shown to work equally well in both settings. We developed SDQ \nversions in Dari and Pashto (now copyrighted, see www.sdqinfo.com).\nTwo other instruments were administered to students. The Birleson Depression Self-\nRating Scale (DSRS) is a brief screening tool (18 items, 3-point scale) for child depressive \nsymptoms,31 which discriminates effectively between severely and non-severely depressed \nchildren, although various cut-off points are used in the literature.  The Child Revised Impact \nof Events Scale (CRIES-13 items, 4-point scale) measures the impact of traumatic \nexperiences; scores of 17+ for combined intrusion\/ avoidance symptoms indicate a level of \ndistress consistent with post-traumatic stress (i.e. PTSD-like symptoms).32 We developed \nDSRS and CRIES versions in Dari and Pashto for the Children and War Foundation \n(www.childrenandwar.org).\nFor caregiver mental health, we used two instruments validated for Afghanistan.33-35\nThe Self-Reported Questionnaire (SRQ-20 items, yes\/no responses) is an international \ninstrument recommended for epidemiological research in low-income countries.33,36  The\nAfghan Symptom Checklist (ASCL 23-items, 5-point scale) was developed specifically in \nKabul, to measure psychological distress using culturally-specific terminology.34,35  \nWith both children and caregivers, we implemented a Traumatic Events Checklist\n(TEC) adapted from the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire37 and Gaza Traumatic Event \nChecklist.38 Our review panel selected twenty (yes\/no) items covering a range of events \npertinent to Afghanistan, differentiating, where appropriate, direct experience from witnessing \nor hearing reports of an event, plus one yes\/no item to allow for \u2018any other\u2019 traumatic \n7experience.  Two additional items collected information on which lifetime event had been the \nmost distressing (among those reported), and when it the latter had occurred.  All participants \nwere given the time and opportunity to explain responses in depth, allowing for \ncontextualisation of meaning, time and place regarding all items reported. Interviewers \nrecorded statements verbatim.  For students, we implemented CRIES in relation to the event \nreported as most distressing.\nSociodemographic data (e.g., displacement, economic status, education level, \nhousehold characteristics) were collected from caregivers. We featured different markers of \nfinancial security, including a material wealth index (MWI) based on household ownership of \n15 pre-specified items. Other data (health checks; interviews on aspirations and social \nenvironment) are not here reported.\nAnalyses\nFollowing the literature, we used binary SDQ outcomes (probable vs. possible\/\nunlikely psychiatric disorder), using a standard algorithm based on multi-informant ratings of \nsymptoms + impact scores.24,25 We also used binary outcomes (CRIES 17+) to evaluate\ncurrent psychological impact of the most (if any) distressing item reported.  We used the full \nrange of scores for other outcomes (DSRS, SRQ-20 and ASCL), to show results per unit \nincrease (additional symptom reported on a dimensional scale), rather than arbitrary or \ndisputed thresholds to discriminate poor\/high mental health.33 Psychometric scales \ndemonstrated very good internal reliability (Cronbach\u2019s alpha >.74 for child and >.84 for \nadult outcomes).  \n               We tested associations between 3 main outcomes (SDQ and CRIES with logistic \nregression, DSRS with linear regression) and 11 a priori risk factors: gender, exposure to \ntrauma, residence area, ethnicity, caregiver mental health, type of caregiver, child\/parental \neducation, age, displacement history, material wealth, and household demographic \ncomposition.  We then built multivariate models (informed by a priori hypotheses and \nunivariate analyses) with 5 predictor variables in the following order: gender, traumatic \nevents, caregiver mental health, residence area, child age.  We excluded other variables (e.g., \nwealth, education) and potential effect modification (interaction with gender, age, or wealth), \nwhich had no significant impact on mental health outcomes. We present regression models \nwith all 5 predictors to facilitate comparison across multiple outcomes (Table 2).  Statistical \nanalyses were adjusted for within-school gender distribution and clustering by school and area\n(using STATA 8.2); this accounts for the probability of selecting boys and girls in \nparticipating schools, as well as common variance within the clusters, producing robust \n8standard errors and conservative estimates for group comparisons. Sensitivity analyses using \nlinear or categorical data (e.g., for trauma events) yielded similar findings.  \nWe analysed reports of trauma in terms of exposure to and nature of events.  For \nmultivariate analysis, we examined the total number of events reported and 4 categories of \nexposure (0, 1-2, 3-4, 5+ events).  For purposes of presentation, we grouped the 21 yes\/no \nTrauma Event Checklist items into 6 types of events: severe physical injury, witnessed severe \nviolence on another person, death\/disappearance of a close relative, being in a combat zone, \nforced displacement from home, and \u2018other\u2019 event.  This categorization was done for all \nreported events (Figure 3) and the most distressing lifetime event (Figure 4).  For the latter, \nwe systematically reviewed respondent statements about the specific trauma reported. \nContent analysis of these verbatim descriptions,39 transcribed and reviewed manually by the \nresearch team in both English and vernacular languages, was used to categorize these reports \ninto sub-types of traumatic experience. These sub-types are shown in Figure 4 for three of six \nmain categories, in order to illustrate the range of events reported.  For this paper, we \nquantified the frequency of these sub-types of trauma in order to provide a more detailed \npicture of reported events, as shown in Figure 4 for three of the six main categories.  \nThematic analysis of respondent narratives will be published elsewhere.\nFINDINGS\nSample socio-demographic characteristics\nOur sample had equal gender representation across study sites.  It included 1011\nstudents, 1011 primary caregivers, and each child\u2019s main classroom teacher (Figure 1). \nCaregivers included mothers (37.6%), fathers (24.5%), and close female (12.7%) or male \n(25.2%) relatives (aunts\/uncles, grandparents, older siblings).  The dataset excluded 9 cases \nwith missing variables of interest.\nStudents averaged 13.5 (SD 1.6) years of age, and 5.7 years (SD 1.9) of formal \neducation.  Eight in ten (82.7%) had been displaced due to conflict and\/or economic reasons,\nincluding 45.1% displaced three or more times (data not shown).  One in ten children was \norphaned from one or both parents. Two in ten worked outside of school hours.  Unpaid work \nincluded service in market stalls or family-owned restaurants; paid work ranged from \npeddling goods, weaving carpets, and working as apprentices \u2013 the latter earning boys less \nthan 50 pence a week.  Most households (59.4%) were rated as very poor\/poor, being unable \nto feed, shelter and\/or clothe family members adequately.  They averaged 5.6 (SD 3.2) MWI\n9items: 52.6% had a piped water supply, 76.7% a radio and 52.8% a mobile phone.  Most \nmothers (72.6%) and 39% of fathers had no formal education.\nMental health outcomes\nThe proportion of students meeting criteria for a probable psychiatric disorder (22.2%, \n[CI 19.6,24.7]; Table 1) was twice the \u2018expectable\u2019 rate for this age-group,40 as predicted from \nmulti-informant SDQ ratings based on symptoms and social functioning. Gender differences \nwere pronounced for \u2018any\u2019 predicted psychiatric disorder, for emotional disorders, and for \ndepression, with girls exhibiting higher levels than boys (Table 2; all p<.0001).  No\nsignificant gender differences were observed for CRIES, with 23.9% [21.3,26.6] of students \nexhibiting strong feelings of intrusion\/anxiety indicative of post-traumatic stress.  All \nmeasures of child mental health and social functioning were significantly associated, \nindicating agreement across multiple informants and different measures (correlations not \nshown).  There were also strong, multiple associations between child and caregiver mental\nhealth (e.g., p<.0001 between multi-informant SDQ ratings for the child and caregiver SRQ-\n20).  These remained highly significant after disaggregating by type and gender of caregiver.\n[Table 1]\nRisk correlates of mental health\nFour variables independently predicted SDQ ratings: female gender, exposure to \nmultiple traumatic events, caregiver\u2019s symptoms of poor mental health, and residence in \nKabul (Table 2).  The same variables associated with symptoms of depression.  As for \nCRIES, no associations were found with gender or residence area, only with number of \ntraumatic events, caregiver mental health, and age of child. Material wealth and \npaternal\/maternal education had no impact on child outcomes. The same results were obtained \nfrom analyses based on the culturally-specific ASCL instead of SRQ-20 for caregiver data.\n[Table 2]\nTwo risk factors, trauma exposure and caregiver mental health, were present across all \nthree measures of child mental health. Exposure to 5+ traumatic events was clearly strongly \npredictive of poor outcomes (SDQ, OR=3.07 [1.78,5.30]; DSRS, \u03b2=1.73 [0.70,2.77]; CRIES, \nOR=3.07 [1.78,5.30]).  In particular, CRIES intrusion\/avoidance scores showed a dose-\nresponse effect (with odds ratios increasing for 3-4 and 5+ events).  The influence of \ncaregiver mental health was also consistent, albeit modest, as shown per additional symptom \nreported (SDQ, OR=1.11 [1.08,1.14]; DSRS, \u03b2=0.07 [0.01, 0.13]; CRIES, OR=1.06 [1.02, \n1.09]).  Other variables were significant for just one or two outcomes.  Thus gender predicted \n10\nSDQ ratings (OR=2.47 [1.65,3.68]) and symptoms of depression (\u03b2=0.86 [0.24,1.48]), but not \nCRIES.\nTraumatic events\nTwo-thirds of all children (63.5% [60.5,66.5]) reported experiencing at least one \ntraumatic event (Figure 3) and 8.4% [6.7,10.1] reported exposure to 5+ events.  There were no \ngender differences by category of traumatic experiences (except forced displacement, \np<.036). \n[Figure 3; Figure 4]\nChildren\u2019s most distressing lifetime trauma was clearly related to violence: this \nencompassed injury, witnessing violence on another person, reporting the death\/\ndisappearance of close relatives, being in a combat zone, and forced displacement (in equal \nproportions, Figure 4).  In the first category (injury), children reported serious accidents, \nsevere beatings by relatives or neighbours, frightening medical treatments, and painful \nillnesses without medical care; only 4 respondents mentioned war-related events such as \nlandmine injury.  only 4 children (2%) reported war-related events; serious accidents, severe \nbeatings by relatives or neighbours, frightening medical treatments, and painful illnesses \nwithout medical care were far more common. The second category (witnessing violence) \nincluded war-related events (summary executions\/beatings during Taliban rule, deaths from \nrocket explosions, mutilated\/dead bodies), but also community-level and domestic violence.  \nThe deaths\/losses of close relatives reported in the third category were primarily related to \nwar, but also included accidents and criminal acts. Among lifetime events reported as most\ndistressing, 16% had occurred prior to Taliban rule, 40% during the Taliban period (1996-\n2001), and 44% after the fall of their regime (2001-present), indicating both past and ongoing \nexposure to violence and distressing experiences. The lifetime events reported as most \ndistressing included both past and ongoing exposure to violence, during the Taliban period \nand after the fall of their regime (2001).  Remarkably, many children escaped the burden of\ntraumatic experiences, either reporting no exposure at all (36.5%) or exhibiting little \npsychological sequelae (CRIES scores) to adverse life events.  \nDISCUSSION\nThis is the first school-based survey of child mental health conducted in Afghanistan, \nyielding systematic data on 11-16 year old students in three central\/northern areas.  We \nprovide evidence for several risk correlates: female gender, traumatic events, caregiver mental \n11\nhealth, and residence area.  We situate these findings in the wider literature, before stating \nstudy limitations and implications.\nEvaluation\nGender differences in emotional problems for adolescents are well-known across \ncultures.22,23  In this sample, girls showed a two-fold risk for predicted psychopathology \nrelative to boys, as well as higher symptoms of depression (Table 2).  A gender dimension to \npoor mental health, rigorously documented here for 11-16 year olds, is certainly pronounced \nfor Afghan adults13-14 reflecting the gender-based \u201cschism\u201d in social life.33  A more \nunexpected finding22 is the relative burden of emotional and behavioural problems for boys\n(SDQ ratings for emotional disorders exceeded those for conduct disorders).  We found, \nhowever, no gender differences for symptoms indicative of post-traumatic stress (as measured \nby CRIES), in line with equivocal reports in the literature.41\n          Consistent with existing literature on war zones,3 exposure to traumatic events was \nstrongly associated with mental health outcomes.  Experiencing 5+ traumatic events trebled \nthe risk of likely psychiatric disorder and post-traumatic stress, also elevating depression \nsymptomology.  Traumatic reports were related to violence, but not necessarily to acts of war: \naccidents, painful medical treatments and beatings by close relatives or neighbours vastly \noutnumbered war-related events (landmine\/combat) among reports of severe physical injury.  \nThere was also significant exposure to ongoing, current adversity: thus children who had \nwitnessed relatives executed\/beaten by Taliban and mujahideen militia were still exposed to \nongoing community-level and domestic violence (e.g., the beating of their mother or sibling \nby male relatives). \nChild-caregiver associations were also consistent across multiple indicators of mental \nhealth status.  We presented these associations in terms of each additional symptom reported \nby caregivers on a 20-point symptom scale, rather than use SRQ-20 thresholds with disputed \nsignificance in the literature.33,42  Thus each symptom reported by caregivers increased the \nodds of multi-informant ratings for child psychiatric disorder by some 11%.  Results from \nanalyses using the culturally-specific instrument (ASCL) for caregiver mental health were \nexactly the same as those generated with the international instrument (SRQ-20; data not \nshown).  A small but significant impact was also recorded for depression and CRIES, per \nadditional caregiver symptom reported.  Associations between child-caregiver mental health \nhave not been previously reported for Afghanistan, but are consistent with the few studies on \nwar-affected adolescents which have been able to obtain parent\/child data.3 We suggest that \ncaregivers\u2019s mental health is linked to the wellbeing of younger generations under their care, a \n12\nlikely result of the interdependence between family members and shared experiences of \nadversity.  \nThe greater burden of mental health problems in Kabul was an unexpected finding of \nthis survey, given that violent conflict is also etched in the social and political past of Bamyan \nand Mazar-e-Sharif communities.  Relative to the two other areas, Kabul children showed \nhigher rates of probable psychiatric disorder and elevated depression symptomology, but no \ndifferences in symptoms akin to post-traumatic stress.  Interestingly, residence in Kabul was \nalso a risk factor for adult caregivers (data not shown).  We relate area-specific findings to the \nmultiplicity of ongoing social and economic stressors in the capital,43,44 where overcrowding, \nhigh living costs, widening inequalities, pressure on resources and day-to-day stressors may \ncompound other adversity directly related to war.45,46  This explanation, while plausible, needs \ninvestigation. \nAs highlighted in one review of psychiatric epidemiology: \u201cfactors other than war-\nrelated violence account for much of the psychological distress among people exposed to \narmed conflict\u201d \u2013 yet \u201csuffering related to poverty, displacement, poor health, spouse abuse, \nand social isolation simply does not draw the same level of international interest and concern \nas war-related trauma\u201d.35  Two large-scale surveys of adults in Afghanistan13,14 have linked a \nhigh prevalence of mental health problems with gender and exposure to traumatic events; yet, \nin both surveys, the most common trauma was \u2018lack of food\/water\u2019 and \u2018ill-health without \nmedical care.\u2019  In a handful of other studies, adult mental health for Afghans was associated \nwith day-to-day social stressors,43,44 poverty,42 and socioeconomic inequalities in access to \nhousing, social and health care.47 In our study, material wealth and education predicted mental \nhealth outcomes for adult caregivers (data not shown), but not for the children.  The one \nqualitative study focusing on children16 concluded that psychosocial wellbeing was largely \ninfluenced by daily stressors such as environmental threats (e.g., road conditions and traffic \naccidents).  Daily stressors are not to be conflated with traumatic experiences.  Yet in the \naftermath of war, the notion of \u2018trauma\u2019 overlaps with that of \u2018social suffering,\u2019 drawing \nsignificance from consequences in both medical and social domains. 48\n             This cautions against simplistic characterisations of trauma. In Afghanistan, there are \nboth spectacular and mundane forms of violence, ranging from armed insurgency to family \nconflict: both \u2018explosive\u2019 and \u2018everyday\u2019 violence, generating sudden pain and ongoing \nsuffering.  Our data suggest that, in Afghan children\u2019s lives, \u2018everyday\u2019 violence matters just \nas much as militarized violence in the recollection of traumatic experiences. As their most\ntraumatic lifetime experience, respondents identified a range of trauma events linked to \n13\nphysical and social stressors with significant repercussions on family dynamics, safety and \nhealth (Figure 4).   Some children identified severe domestic beatings, a severe accident, or a \nfrightening medical treatment as trauma that was more salient than having witnessed first-\nhand the deaths of parents and grandparents killed in rocket attacks.  Conversely, others \nidentified as their most severe trauma the death of a relative killed in the distant past, rather \nthan recurrent distressing experiences of severe domestic beatings.  The selective \nprioritisation of a particular event does not mean that it is per se the root cause of mental \ndistress.7 However, it does suggest that children assign significance to war-related, \ncommunity, and family-level traumatic events on the basis of their current life circumstances \nand needs.49\nEvidence of psychological suffering must be balanced, however, against evidence of \nfortitude and coping with adversity. Our survey data fall just within the expected range [CIs] \nfor emotional and behavioural disorders in children, namely an \u201coverall prevalence of 10-15% \n(\u2026) in children in the general population, which can increase up to 20% in regions of \nsocioeconomic adversity.\u201d50 Some 22.2% [19.6,24.7] of students met multi-informant SDQ \ncriteria for probable psychiatric rating, twice the rate (9.6%) found in British national school-\nbased surveys40 with the same methodology.  Students, as well as caregivers and teachers, \nreported many symptoms of mental health difficulties, but also rated their social functioning \npositively (across domains of home, classroom, social, and leisure activities).  By age 11-16, \nAfghans live in a society marked by ongoing, often multiple exposure to adverse and violent \nevents, affecting everyday personal and social experiences. In this study, 63.5% [60.5,66.5] of \nchild respondents reported exposure to traumatic events; 23.9% [21.3,26.6] exhibited \nsubstantial psychological distress in the wake of their most frightening lifetime event. As our \ndata reveal, experiencing 5+ traumatic events has striking consequences for mental health, but \nthere is some measure of resilience in negotiating the impact of 1-2 traumatic experiences\n(Table 2).  Other literature emphasises that war-affected adolescents can present both high \nsymptoms of psychopathology and competent social functioning,7,51 and that focusing on \nsymptoms, without examining social impact, leads to \u201cimplausibly high\u201d rates of mental \nhealth disorder.52\nLimitations\nThree limitations of the study are explicitly noted: sampling bias, respondent bias and \ninstrument diagnostic validity.  A sampling bias was introduced by purposively choosing \nthree geographical areas (not representative of the country overall) and failing to include \nchildren whose families could not, or chose not, to send them to school.  Our survey captured \n14\na random sample of school-children, yielding the first dataset on a growing proportion of \nAfghan boys and girls attending state-sponsored schools.  Because non-school attending \nchildren may be at greater risk of mental health disorder,23  the sampling bias is likely to \nunderestimate relationships observed in our data.\nA known limitation of psychiatric research is that respondents have different \ncompetence and sensitivity when reporting mental health difficulties.23,24 Strict cultural \nprescriptions for gender segregation and assignment of responsibility for adolescent children \ninfluenced which caregiver came for interview (72% were fathers or male guardians in the \ncase of boys, 73% were mothers or female guardians in the case of girls).  It is possible that\nfemale caregivers, who suffered poorer mental health than males, saw children in more \nnegative light, which would exaggerate gender-based associations between adult and child \nmental health. However, the study derives methodological strength from providing ratings on \nmental health difficulties and social impact across three informants (children, caregivers, \nteachers):40 this is hardly ever implemented in low-income or war-affected countries.23 It is \nalso possible that men and women were differentially inclined to report their distress or \naggravate their problems to signal a need for material assistance,53 although we paid careful \nattention to issues of communication, rapport, time and privacy.  \nWe used instruments shown to be useful and valid for screening purposes in a range of \nWestern\/non-Western cultures and low\/high income countries, but without clinical \nrevalidation in Afghanistan.  Our methodological strengths lie in the use of multiple \ninstruments, with attention paid to cross-cultural reliability and validity.20,54 The multi-\ninformant SDQ ratings go beyond a narrow focus on symptomology: they systematically \ninclude respondents\u2019 own evaluations of the functional and social significance of a child\u2019s \nmental health difficulties, in terms of causing distress and impairment in daily life. We are \nmindful of debates regarding the relevance of absolute thresholds for community-wide \nscreening across cultures33 and the important distinction between general psychological \ndistress (suffering) and severe mental health disorder (pathology).18,55 Rather than seeking to \nestablish prevalence rates for specific psychiatric disorders, we focus attention on risk factors\nfor mental health problems and psychological distress, and the robustness of findings across \nmultiple instruments.  \nImplications\nOur study demonstrates the feasibility and potential value of working in schools to \nidentify the nature and risk correlates of child mental health, using lay interviewers and brief \ninstruments.36  Our research was well-received; teachers remarked that they had not \n15\npreviously reflected on the impact mental health difficulties could have for scholastic \nperformance and students commented that they had never previously been asked about their \nfeelings related to school and\/or home experiences.  In this socially conservative context, \nmany female caregivers had never been given the opportunity to visit the school or meet their \nchild\u2019s teacher.  Our study raised awareness of the importance of child mental health issues \nwithin school settings and suggests that school-based interventions would be well-received.  \nCommunity-level interventions, in the form of school-based mental health\nprogrammes, are nascent, localised initiatives in Afghanistan,43 but already advocated26 and \nsuccessful56 in Pakistan and for children affected by political violence in the West \nBank\/Gaza57 and Indonesia.58 Policy support for public-health interventions1 to alleviate \ntrauma, mental health disorders and psychological distress is currently a priority12 for the \nAfghan government.  This is due to the acute shortage of qualified mental health care \npractitioners, the current level of provision of basic health and social services,59 and the \nchallenges of programming with youth.60 Emerging consensus advocates several layers of \nsupport for mental health programmes in emergency settings: those targeting the family and \ncommunity, as well as more specialist care for those in clinical need.5\nWe highlight two robust predictors of poor mental health outcomes for children: \nexposure to multiple trauma and caregiver mental health. The former predictor is consistent \nwith findings in the existing literature.  We draw attention, however, to the significance of \neveryday violence and trauma which is not narrowly focused on war.  This serves to broaden\nunderstanding of trauma and place it in the context of \u2018everyday\u2019 forms of suffering, violence \nand adversity.  The consistent, albeit modest, parent-child associations for mental health \noutcomes point to psychosocial suffering being embedded in household dynamics and shared \nadverse experiences. The simple but powerful conclusion of a meta-review of cross-cultural \npsychiatric research rings true for Afghan society: \u201cthe key to giving young people a good \nstart in life is to help their parents.\u201d1 Our findings lend support to interventions which address \nmental health issues at family and community-level, framing policies to strengthen whole \nfamily units and enhance their access to basic social, health and educational services.5,12\nConflict of interest statement: There is no conflict of interest.  \nSponsor: the Wellcome Trust [073305].  \nContributors:  XXX and XXX co-wrote the paper and evaluated all data, with input from \nother investigators.
