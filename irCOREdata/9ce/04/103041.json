This article examines this Convention against the backdrop of the principal\u2013agent\u2013client\n(PAC) model which influences much of the current anti-corruption measures ranging from legal and\ncivil service reform through to privatisation of the public sector. In focusing on the efforts to fight and\nprevent corruption through legal and public sector reform, this paper highlights the limitations of\nexternally imposed solutions largely driven by donors. Using Tanzania, a country that has seen\nextensive technical input from donor agencies in reforming the law and bureaucratic structures, as an\nillustration, this article argues that the limited success of such donor-driven anti-corruption strategies is\nattributable to a number of reasons ranging from reform policies of donors and paternalistic attitudes\nto political shifts and antipathy towards external demands for reforms that are fuelled by the colonial\npast. This paper recommends that for a recipient country to take ownership of the anti-corruption\nstrategies it is important to tailor the PAC model to the cultural, social and political context of the\nrecipient country so that the solutions are seen as an indigenous initiative, thus enabling sustainable\nchange in attitudes and behaviour.\nIntroduction\nAfrica is a continent rich in resources and human skills but greatly affected by poverty and human\nsuffering. Part of the reason for poverty is insatiable human greed manifesting itself in the form of\ncorruption at all levels, from politicians and senior civil servants to the humble clerk,1 that deprives\nfellow human beings of basic amenities such as access to food, medicine, housing and schooling.\nMonies aimed at capacity building and infrastructure improvement get lost on theway in the form of\nbribes and kickbacks to unscrupulous businessmen, civil servants and politicians.2 Despite the\n* I should like to thank Professor OddHelge Fjeldstad, Dr Tina Soreide and the Chr.Michelsen Institute, Bergen,\nNorway for their hospitality in June 2007 and the UK Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC) for\nfunding my research project on Corruption in International Business. I also thank the anonymous reviewers\nfor their constructive comments. Any infelicities remain my own.\n1 The motivations for seeking bribes vary, from need to greed. In the case of the clerk who seeks a bribe it is\nprobably need rather than greed that is the guiding motive due to poor prospects. For instance the Service\nDelivery Survey focusing on corruption in the police, judiciary, revenue and land services commissioned by\nPresident Mkapa of Tanzania in 1996 found low salaries and poor conditions of services were the reasons for\ncorruption in the public services; see CIET International (1996a, p. 5).\n2 It is often said that members of the ruling elite tend to seek self-satisfaction rather than act in the public good\nin order to maintain their positions in an unequal society. The incidences of corruption amongst African\npoliticians are well publicised.

For both\nthese philosophers avarice is a dangerous element of the human soul. Aristotle states that men are\nalways wanting more and more since it is the nature of desire to be dissatisfied.7 These views are as\ntrue now as they were then and can easily apply to corrupt practices found in today\u2019s world.\nInequality of power between the civil servant as service provider and the client as service seeker,\ncoupled with economic inequality (e.g. low wages in the public sector),8 are reasons why, like the\nHydra, corruption rears its ugly head in a variety of guises in many countries.\nThere is sufficient evidence to indicate that corruption does contribute to lack of\neconomic growth and hence poverty.9 As the ex-president of the World Bank,10 Paul\nCourt ordered that Dr Chiluba repay the treasury around US$ 51 million. The implementation of the UK\nHigh Court ruling has been challenged in Lusaka by Dr Chiluba on the basis that it would be contrary to\nZambian public policy.\n3 Thirty-four countries in Africa figure as LDCs: Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cape Verde, Central\nAfrican Republic, Chad, Comoros, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea,\nEthiopia, Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Lesotho, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania,\nMozambique, Niger, Rwanda, Sa\u02dco Tome\u00b4 and Principe, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, Togo,\nUganda, United Republic of Tanzania and Zambia. List derived from UNCTAD\/LDC\/Misc\/2005\/3 (2005).\nAccording to the UN, LDCs refer to states that are \u2018deemed highly disadvantaged in their development\nprocess . . . and facing more than other countries the risk of failing to come out of poverty\u2019.\n4 For an excellent multi-disciplinary theoretical framework of corruption, see Dobel (1978).\n5 See, for instance, Plato (1955) 421d\u2013422b, 547\u2013 553e.\n6 Aristotle (1962, Book 2 chapter 7, Book 5 chapter 2). According to Machiavelli (1965), even the best of\nindividuals can become corrupted through a little ambition and greed.\n7 1962, Book 2 chapters 7, 8.\n8 According to a study conducted by Quah (2001), one of the causes of corruption in colonial Singapore was\nlow salaries in civil service. Singapore\u2019s anti-corruption strategy consisted of increasing the salaries of those\nin the public sector which, alongwith othermeasures, seems to have paid off. Singapore figures as one of the\nleast corrupt countries in Transparency International\u2019s corruption index.\n9 See for example, Alatas (1990), Bergsten and Elliott (1997), Mbaku (1994), Gould and Mukendi (1989) and\nRose-Ackerman (1975).\n10 The World Bank comprises two development institutions \u2013 the International Bank for Reconstruction and\nDevelopment (IBRD) and the International Development Association (IDA) \u2013 and three affiliate agencies \u2013\nthe International Finance Corporation (IFC), the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) and\nthe International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). The WB was initially not\nconcernedwith corruption since it was seen as a political matter. The exclusion of politics is clearly stated in\nArt III(5)(b) and Art IV(10) of the IBRD Articles of Agreement which read:\nArt III, Sec. 5 (b)\nThe Bank shall make arrangements to ensure that the proceeds of any loan are used only for the purposes for which\nthe loanwas granted, with due attention to considerations of economy and efficiency andwithout regard to political\nor other non-economic influences or considerations.\nArt IV, Sec. 10\nThe Bank and its officers shall not interfere in the political affairs of any member; nor shall they be influenced in\ntheir decisions by the political character of the member or members concerned. Only economic considerations shall\nindira carr148\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 07 Jan 2011 IP address: 131.227.169.211\nWolfowitz,11 stated \u2018[c]orruption is a disease that drains resources and discourages investment. It\nbenefits the privileged and deprives the poor. Today, there are more than one billion people world-\nwide surviving from one day to the next on [US]$1 a day. Corruption threatens their hope for a better\nquality of life and a more promising future.\u201912 Policymakers, economists and politicians from both\nthe developed and developing countries have been aware of the high levels of corruption in many of\nthe former colonies. However, during much of the twentieth century corruption was a taboo subject\nand it was generally regarded as a normal practice that one needed to engage in in order to do\nbusiness. Of course, this apathy to take action, both at the national and international level, by\ndeveloped countries could be viewed with an air of cynicism. After all, lucrative contracts abroad\nwere important for generating growth at home, especially at a time when former colonisers such as\nFrance and the UK were slowly finding their feet by rebuilding their tattered economies after the\nSecond World War. Alternatively, it can be explained in slightly nobler terms \u2013 a respect for\nsovereignty and a reluctance to interfere in the internal matters of a foreign country. It was only\nin the 1970s, as a result of a survey by the US Securities Exchange Commission, that attention was\nopenly drawn to the high levels of corrupt engagement by US corporations in the form of bribes and\nkickbacks. This led to the US passing legislation13 to criminalise corrupt behaviour by US corpora-\ntions in foreign jurisdictions. The US expected that other developed countries with substantial\noverseas business interests such as the UK would follow suit, but it took another two decades for\nthe problem of corruption to be widely acknowledged as a global problem that required immediate\ninternational attention and intervention. Since the 1990s, international attention has been drawn to\nthe global phenomenon of corruption, with its negative effects on developing countries and its close\nconnection to poverty. Politicians and leading institutions such as development banks (e.g. the\nWorld Bank (WB), the African Development Bank (AfDB)) and national aid agencies (e.g. the US\nAgency for International Development (USAID)14, the UK Department for International\nDevelopment (DFID)) involved in providing project finance for infrastructural development, have\nalso become involved in the fight against corruption by requiring donee countries to ratify the anti-\ncorruption conventions and to undertake extensive domestic law reforms. Fighting corruption is no\nlonger a localised phenomenon but an international one, and the aim is to eliminate poverty and\nimprove the quality of life of millions around the world.15 As part of this global drive to fight\nbe relevant to their decisions, and these considerations shall be weighed impartially in order to achieve the purposes\nstated in Article 1.\nHowever theWorld Bank\u2019s apathy towards corruption changed with the arrival of James D. Wolfensohn as\nits President. Instead of focusing on whether the World Bank should engage or not engage with politics he\ndecided to redefine \u2018the \u2018\u2018C\u2019 word [being corruption] not as a political issue but as something social and\neconomic\u2019; see Wolfensohn (1999).\n11 He resigned from the World Bank in June 2007 for ethical lapses. He was having a relationship with an\nemployee. There were also questions in respect of his management style. For more on the background\nregarding conflict of interest see The World Bank Ethics Committee (2007).\n12 See World Bank (2006).\n13 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 1977.\n14 For an in-depth discussion of US development policy in the battle against global poverty see Patrick, Birdsall\nand Vaishnav (2006).\n15 Admittedly civil strife and border disputes also contribute to poverty. Part of the civil strife in resource-rich\ncountries is attributable to the unequal treatment of tribes and groups who populate these resource-rich\nlands and whose rights, economic and otherwise, are overlooked in the process of their land\u2019s exploitation\nby the multinational corporations and the ruling governments.\nanti-corruption protocol and the principal\u2013agent\u2013client model 149\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 07 Jan 2011 IP address: 131.227.169.211\ncorruption, the Southern African Development Community (SADC)16 adopted its Protocol on\nCorruption in 2000 (SADC Protocol).17 Requiring signatures from two-thirds of the member states,\nit sits alongside other regional18 and international conventions19 and is an indicator of the apparent\nseriousness with which policy-makers intend to conform with the global demands and standards to\nfurther anti-corruption strategies.\nThis article consists of three sections. Section I considers the model used by economists for\nanalysing corruption, which informs much of the legal framework, including that of the SADC\nProtocol and donor-led initiatives in respect of corruption and governance of anti-corruptionmatters\nin donee countries. Section II engages with the difficulties of drawing the parameters of corruption,\nand in this process examines the approach adopted by the SADC Protocol and considers whether the\nlist of offences is adequate to combat commonly acknowledged forms of corruption. Section III\nfocuses on how far the SADC Protocol goes towards advocating preventativemechanisms that reflect\nthe PAC model and explores the kinds of issues that need to be tackled if preventative mechanisms\nare to play a vital role in reducing corruption in developing countries. Tanzania20 is used as an\nillustration for these purposes for a number of reasons:\n(1) It is a member of SADC and the African Union (AU);\n(2) It has ratified anti-corruption conventions adopted by both these organisations;\n(3) It has been a major recipient of loans from national and international donor agencies;21\n16 The member countries are Angola, Botswana, Democratic Republic of Congo, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius,\nMozambique, Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. With the\nexception of Botswana, Mauritius, Seychelles, South Africa, Swaziland and Zimbabwe, the other countries\nare regarded as LDCs in the UN List (see ftn 3 above).\n17 The Convention is not yet in force. It has been ratified so far by Botswana, Lesotho,Malawi, Mauritius, South\nAfrica, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.\n18 The other regional conventions are:\n(1) Organisation of American States Inter-American Convention Against Corruption 1996 (OAS\nConvention).

ODA consists of both technical co-operation (grants\nfor education, training and payments to consultants) and financial aid consisting of loans at concessional\nrates and grants. In most cases the grant element will be around 25 percent. For more on aid to Tanzania see\nBigsten, Mutalemwa, Tsikata and Wangwe (1999). According to this study, since independence in 1961\nTanzania has received aid from fifty bilateral sources. Among them the Nordic countries, consisting of\nSweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland, alongside Germany, the Netherlands, Canada, the US and the UK\nfigure asmajor donors.

According to thiswidely\nacceptedmodel (the principal\u2013agent\u2013client or PACmodel), corruption occurs when an agent betrays the\nprincipal\u2019s interest in pursuit of his own by accepting or seeking a benefit from the service seeker, the\nclient (C). The conditions for corruption present themselves when the principal (P) is in a powerful\nposition and the agent (A), whomPhas entrusted to carry out the services, has an element of discretion in\nadministering the services, and there is a lack or near lack of accountability.23 If P is in a monopolistic\nposition, for instance in the telecommunications sector, and the decision of how, when, where and to\nwhomconnections are to be allocated is left to A\u2019s judgementwith no clear and accessible procedures and\nchecks in respect of the decision-making process, the situation easily lends itself to corruption. Opacity\nandhigh discretion levels in an organisation that holds a powerful position create the right conditions for\ncorrupt behaviour. The proposition here is that A may be or is likely to be self-seeking (behaving in his\nown interest), rather than acting in the interests of P, his employer. In other words, A does not have the\nlevel of integrity or overlooks the level of integrity expected of him, in that he makes no separation\nbetween the public and the private spheres and uses his public position for private gain.24\nWhile much of the discourse relating to the PAC model has taken place in the context of the\npublic sector, it can equally apply to the private sector, even where the condition of monopolistic\nstatus may not be entirely met. Corrupt practices within a company\u2019s (P) purchasing department\nprovide a good illustration of where a high level of discretion accorded to the purchasing manager\n(A), coupled with lack of accountability, could result in A coming to an arrangement (monetary or\notherwise) with the supplier that promotes A\u2019s rather than P\u2019s interests. In adopting the PAC model,\nimprovements to three areas are needed to see a reduction in corruption:\nbe said that grants for technical co-operation seem to have been easily allocated and tended to bemanaged in\na relaxed manner. In many instances donors competed with each other and provided grants for similar\nprojects resulting in duplicationwhich reduced any incentives there might have been for their implementa-\ntion. For further on this see Berg (1993). An important question in respect of aid generally is the motivation\nof the donors. While it may be expressed in sentimental terms such as solidarity and the development of the\ndisadvantaged states nonetheless asWhite (1974) observes, some donors saw it as ameans of influencing the\ndonee to adopt a particular ideology (e.g. the US) or as a means of consolidating its relationship with its\nex-colonies while some (e.g. Germany, Japan) saw it as a means of forging commercial and political\nrelationships.\n22 The United Republic of Tanzania (1996). It is difficult to trace a copy of the full report. This author was able\nto find one at the Chr. Michelsen Institute in Bergen, Norway.\n23 Klitgaard (1988).\n24 Often called the Weberian rational-legal model of administration. According to this model the public and\nprivate sphere of officials are separate and this separation has to be maintained; see Weber (1947). Until\nrecently (the nineteenth century) in much of Europe the rule was of a patrimonial type and did not follow\nthe Weberian rational-legal model. The transition to the Weberian model was a gradual one. For more on\nthis gradual evolution from patrimony where all assets, personal and public, are owned by the leader to the\nmodern Weberian model, see North and Thomas (1996).\nanti-corruption protocol and the principal\u2013agent\u2013client model 151\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 07 Jan 2011 IP address: 131.227.169.211\n1) reducing the monopolistic power;\n2) improving the environment within which discretion is exercised that would infuse confidence in\nthe exercise of that discretion; and\n3) improving accountability and transparency.\nDiscretion, accountability and transparency or openness are closely connected and, as such, improve-\nments in one are likely to contribute towards improvements in the others.\nIntroducing competition is seen as essentially the route to reduce monopolistic power. Within\nthe public sector, where this position is more difficult, competition could be introduced by enabling\na number of government departments or institutions to deal with the provision of the same service,\nbe it permits, export licences and so on.25 Studies suggest that infusion of competition sees a\nreduction in corruption.26 Adopting such a measure would see, for instance, both the Ministries of\nAgriculture and of Trade giving export licences for exporting agricultural products, or the\nDepartments of Agricultural Products and of Licences within the same ministry providing export\nlicences. There are, however, a number of limitations to this approach, in the current climate of\nnational and global security concerns. First, it may not suit the provision of all types of public\nservices, for instance ID cards and passports. Second, allowing multiple institutions or multiple\ndepartments within the same institution to deal with the provision of the same service has the\npotential to create excessive bureaucracy and public confusion. It thus creates opportunities for the\nharassment of members of the public unless the procedures for obtaining the services through\ndifferent avenues are transparent and well publicised. While this may work in a country with high\nliteracy rates and a robust civil service, it might not work, for instance, in developing countries where\nthe population is largely illiterate or an overworked civil service is entrenched in bureaucratic\npractices. Third, there is the danger that rules may be interpreted variously in different sections of\nthe government sector, thus leaving the door open for unequal treatment. Finally, the involvement\nof a number of departments or institutions in providing the same service may result in information\nbreakdown or bottlenecks that may hinder effective investigations in the event of reports of an\noffence. So measures undertaken to introduce competition will have to be carefully crafted to suit\nlocal conditions rather than simply adopting a \u2018one size fits all\u2019 approach.27\nThe recommendations for breaking down the monopolistic character of state-owned enterprises\nare liberalisation, de-regulation (less interventionism), private\u2013public partnership and privatisa-\ntion.28 Such measures are often closely associated with capitalism and the question of whether\ncreating an environment that lends itself easily to infusing competition29 is largely dependent on the\n25 Rose-Ackerman (1978).\n26 See Persson, Roland and Tabellini (1997); Lederman, Loayza and Soares (2001).\n27 There are debates surrounding the issue of the effect of constitutional arrangements on corruption; see\nFisman and Gatti (2002), Kunicova and Rose-Ackerman (2005); Tavits (2007).\n28 Whether privatisation of public sector entities results in lower corruption is highly debatable due to varying\nviews: see e.g. Duckett (2001), Clarke and Xu (2002). The World Bank has been an active voice for the\nprivatisation of utilities since the 1990s due to a perception of the state as an inefficient provider of services\nin the utilities sector. The World Bank has played a major role in the privatisation of the water sector in\ndeveloping countries with disastrous consequences; see World Bank (1993; 1997). In Tanzania, the water\nprivatisation programme supported by theWorld Bank has not been a success. It resulted in increased water\nprices with little improvement in supply, resulting in the termination of the contract with Biwater, a\ncompany based in the UK. Biwater brought an action against Tanzania in the ICSID (International Court for\nSettlement of Investment Disputes) for compensation, which was unsuccessful (Biwater Grauff (Tanzania) v.\nUnited Republic of Tanzania (ICSID Case No. ARB\/05\/22). For other countries\u2019 experiences with water\nprivatisation, see, for instance, Olleta (2007) and Dagdeviren (2008).\n29 Competition is closely related to its potential to bring welfare to its citizens, at least in European dialogue.\nBut as to whether competition has this effect in developing countries is questionable; see, for example,\nMcAuslan (1997).\nindira carr152\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 07 Jan 2011 IP address: 131.227.169.211\npolitical structure of a country and its economic policies. However, with the ever-increasing number\nof countries joining the World Trade Organisation, founded on the principles of free trade, there is\nevery reason to say that the market economy has taken root in most countries and along with it the\ngreater participation of the private sector in a country\u2019s economic growth. Even China, despite a\ndifferent political ideology, has adapted itself to this mode of engaging in trade and economic\ngrowth. That changes to the economic infrastructure are essential in reducing corruption is taken\nseriously by the WB and other development agencies and is often one of the conditions imposed on\ndonee states.30 As a result, many developing countries have undergone a rapid privatisation pro-\ngramme. For instance, in Tanzania between 1994 and 1999, around 150 out of 386 public enterprises\nwere divested.31 And this process is not unique to Tanzania or Africa. Developing countries in other\ncontinents have had to adopt similar methods. For instance, in India the utilities sector has seen\ngreater participation from the private sector. The telecommunications sector in India is a good\nillustration of where the entry of the private sector has seen spectacular results. Equally, the\nmonopolistic roles of state enterprises have also been eroded through amix of relaxation of exchange\ncontrols, licences and permits. State trading corporations that virtually held a monopolistic position\nin most post-colonial states in the import\/export trade due to shortage of hard currency have seen\ntheir role diminish gradually.\nThe need for competition is often supported by the welfare argument. But one needs to be aware\nthat privatisation does not necessarily bring with it the envisaged benefits. Instead of providing\nwelfare it has the potential to take welfare away from the public, as has happened in a number of\ncountries. Privatisation of basic utilities such as water and electricity has seen the costs of obtaining\nthese services spiral, with the result that the poor can no longer afford these services whereas they\ncould when they were controlled and subsidised by the public sector.32 In this context, Private Public\nPartnership (PPP) is often said to provide a better option.33 It does not necessarily follow that\nopportunities for corruption are reduced when a public sector turns into a private sector, since it\ncreates new opportunities for corruption, for instance during the sale of assets.34 It also has the\npotential to import hitherto unfamiliar corrupt practices found within the private sector.35\nDiscretion, the freedom to exercise judgement with authority as one sees fit, is a factor built into\nthe dealings of most public bodies for a number of reasons: efficiency, expediency, fairness, equality,\njustice, adaptability and flexibility among others. The degree of discretion will vary from context to\ncontext and is linked to goals in the provision of a particular service to the public. It is normally\nembedded in the rules, norms and adopted practices that guide the decision-making process of A. In\nthe provision of land development and planning, for instance, ensuring fairness, equality, justice, the\nneeds of the community and the protection of the public at large are likely to be the goals, and these\nmight justify a greater degree of discretion. The latitude allowed is, however, likely to be context\ndependent. There may be greater laxity for low-level tasks, such as granting a building permit for\nextending a garage into the garden as opposed to granting a building permit for converting a school\n30 US General Accounting Office (2004).\n31 For more figures on privatisation in other sub-Saharan countries, see World Bank (2003).\n32 See von Weizsa\u00a8cker, Young and Finger (2006) for some case studies, including water privatisation in\nTanzania.\n33 See UN\/ECE (2000); Ghobadian, O\u2019Regan, Gallear and Viney, (2004).\n34 According to Holmes (2006), the level of corruption in post-communist states is high due to neoliberalist\npolicies that recommend aminimal role for the state. The reason for this is that privatisation has taken place\nwith no thought given to ethical guidelines or appropriate regulatory mechanisms.\n35 See Huther and Shah (2001); Duckett (2001).\nanti-corruption protocol and the principal\u2013agent\u2013client model 153\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 07 Jan 2011 IP address: 131.227.169.211\nbuilding into a prison block in a high-density area, since the consequences flowing from the granting\nof the latter might raise significant issues for the local community and the public at large.\nAccording to the PAC model, unfettered discretion combined with a lack of accountability has\nthe potential to cause corruption. One way to resolve this issue would be to get rid of discretion\naltogether. Attractive though it might be, it is an unwise choice since discretion has an important\nrole to play in the pursuit of goals such as efficient and expedient dealing in public services, fair\ntreatment and equality that a state sets for itself. A better option would be to make the public sector\nmore accountable and open and to introduce professionalism in the civil services.\nBefore going on to highlight how accountability is to be introduced, it is important to establish\nwhat is meant by accountability. As with most concepts, it seems to be variously interpreted. In its\nsimplest form it is construed as a counting exercise such that a government department is required to\nindicate, for instance, the number of new school teachers appointed during a particular period and\nthe numbers of desks and chairs bought for accommodating these appointments. This simplistic\napproach does not give any information on the quality of the desks and chairs or indeed why these\nnew appointments were made. In good-governance-speak, accountability goes beyond this simple\nnotion to include responsibility, answerability and responsiveness so that providing explanations\nand justifications are central to the notion of accountability alongside any sanctions for behaving\nirresponsibly.36 Accountability also has an internal and external dimension and this implies being\naccountable to those within the institutions and those outside the institutions, such as the citizens\nand civil society organisations. It thus brings with it a social side where there is an opportunity for\nengagement and a meaningful two-way dialogue between civil society and government institutions,\nthereby making an important contribution to the provision of services and confidence in the public\nsector. The end result is that the government, its institutions and the civil service are subject to close\nscrutiny, both internal and external.\nIn order to meet the above good governance criteria, various mechanisms that strengthen the\nintegrity and accountability of the civil service need to be put in place. These include:\n\u2022 Clear indication of line of responsibility within institutions and government;\n\u2022 Clear indication of rules, regulations and procedures followed in the decision-making process;\n\u2022 Public access to rules and procedures;\n\u2022 Promotion of greater integrity and accountability within the legal services sector, including the\njudiciary;37\n\u2022 Codes of conduct for civil servants and education in the importance of maintaining integrity;\n\u2022 Civil service reform \u2013 for instance recruitment through open competition, and training in the\nprovision of services;\n\u2022 Regular rotation of civil servants between departments;\n\u2022 Complaints mechanisms so that citizens can complain in respect of public services;\n\u2022 A regular forum for institutions and civil society to engage in dialogue with a view to improving\nthe services provided; and\n\u2022 Creation of independent pro-accountability agencies in specific sectors such as a Human Rights\nOmbudsman and an Anti-Corruption Commission that can hold a government accountable.\nThe donor community has pressed on with requiring donee states to put in place mechanisms\nthat will infuse integrity, transparency and accountability as part of the public sector reform agenda.\nUsing Tanzania as an illustration, Section III highlights the changes that have been introduced with\n36 For a variety of definitions of accountability, see Schedler, Diamond and Plattner (1999); Mulgan (2000);\nBehn (2001); Ackerman (2003).\n37 For more on corruption in the judiciary, see Transparency International (2007); CIET International (1996b);\nUNODC (2001).\nindira carr154\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 07 Jan 2011 IP address: 131.227.169.211\nextensive help from national and international financial institutions since the Warioba Report on\ncorruption in 1996. Equally, the anti-corruption conventions have also introduced various measures\nrelated to increasing integrity and accountability. These measures will be considered in Section III\nbelow as part of the examination of preventative measures with the aim of showing that legal and\ninstitutional reforms do not always result in the intended effects and that an approach that is\ncognisant of the specifics of a country is required to make serious inroads to tackle corruption.\nII Corruption \u2014 the parameters\nIt is common for most legislation to provide extensive definitions of the terms used within that\nconvention. By way of illustration, Art 2 of the United Nations Convention on Corruption 2003 (UN\nConvention) contains a list of terms and definitions for the purposes of that convention. However,\nnowhere in Art 2 is there a definition of corruption. Providing a generic definition of corruption38 is\nperhaps one of the most difficult tasks and there is much truth when R.J. Williams says that:\n\u2018[t]he study of corruption is like a jungle and, if we are unable to bring it to a state of orderly\ncultivation, we at least require a guide to the flora and fauna. This need has impelled many\nwriters to find a precise definition which will accurately characterise the phenomenon . . . it is\nimportant to note that there are nearly as many definitions as there are species of tropical plants\nand they vary as much in their appearance, character and resilience. The point is that the search\nfor the true definition of corruption is, like the pursuit of the Holy Grail, endless, exhausting and\nultimately futile.\u201939\nThe variety of definitions reflects the varieties of behaviour we tend to classify in everyday\ndiscourse as corrupt; some focusing on individual behaviour, some on group and political behaviour,\nsome on immorality and some on the lack of distinction between the public and private spheres. The\ninstances of behaviour (not all involving mutual exchange) that we normally tend to perceive as\ncorrupt include:\n(1) Patronage \u2013 bestowal of a benefit to an individual, individuals or a group by virtue of a relation-\nship regardless of merit. In agrarian societies this may involve the bestowal of a cottage by a\nlandlord to a peasant. Inmore complex circumstances this may involve benefits, for instance, to a\nrelative, a friend, members of a group, a club, a school, caste or a religious faction;40\n(2) Bribery \u2013 where there is an immediate or delayed mutual exchange of a benefit in return for a\nbenefit, be it monetary or otherwise;\n(3) Misappropriation \u2013 illegal appropriation of funds for private use;\n38 It must be said that the perception and hence the classification of human behaviour as corrupt also changes\nover time and are attributable to political shifts, economic development and shifting social mores. For\ninstance, in a patrimonial society no distinction is drawn between the private and public assets of a leader\n(where the leader\u2019s authority is derived from tradition), so the use of public assets for private needs is\nacceptable. One of the problems about African leaders is that they largely seem to operate within this\npatrimonial framework despite structures left by the colonials. Since they do not derive their authority\nthrough tradition they resort to purchasing power through patronage. For accounts of neopatrimonialism,\nsee, for example, Eisenstadt (1973); Leys (1965, pp. 226\u201327). For some more recent literature, see Fatton\n(1992); Bratton and van de Walle (1997, especially chapter 2; van de Walle (2001). According to Bratton and\nvan de Walle (1997), the political institutions that play important roles in African neopatrimonial regimes\nare the concentration of political power in a single individual (the President), and clientilism, where jobs,\ncontracts, licences, etc are awarded as personal favours and state resources are used for political legitimation.\n39 Williams 1976, p. 41.\n40 Often referred to as parochial corruption (where ties of kinship, group, etc. determine access to favours) as\nopposed to market corruption, where the process is an impersonal one and is dependent on who can pay the\nmost; see Scott (1969, p. 330).\nanti-corruption protocol and the principal\u2013agent\u2013client model 155\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 07 Jan 2011 IP address: 131.227.169.211\n(4) Disloyalty \u2013 illegal use of confidential\/sensitive information;\n(5) Societal corruption \u2013 behaviour that is morally questionable, such as the adoption of aesthetic\nvalues by the younger generation that are alien to the older generation, or the show of wealth by\nan individual in total disregard of widespread poverty within a nation;41\n(6) Lack of civic virtue \u2013 behaviour that is totally motivated by self-interest and total disregard of the\ncommon good;42 and\n(7) Decay of the political order.43\nAnd when the view that there are variations between cultures44 (relativism) is taken within the\nepistemological framework, the task of drawing the exact parameters of corruption for legislative\npurposes, that is the activities that are to be regarded as illegal, becomes more daunting. It comes as\nno surprise then that any talk of anti-corruption legislation, be it in an academic context or\notherwise, always raises amongst others the following kinds of responses:\n(a) That it is culture specific, that bribery is the norm in some societies and that it is perfectly moral\nand acceptable in those societies, and that any attempt to arrive at a common understanding of\ncorruption is indeed difficult if not impossible;\n(b) That it is largely a moral issue and is linguistically understood as referring to morally reprehen-\nsible behaviour;\n(c) That existing legislation within a country against fraud or false accounting may perhaps be\nsufficient to deal with corrupt practices such as themisappropriation of public funds and bribery.\nBefore going on to consider the parameters of corruption, the above responses need to be addressed.\nIn response to (a) there is no doubt that culture specificity is relevant. Types of human conduct that\nare frowned upon in one culture and attract the label of corruption may be common practice and\naccepted (or tolerated)45 as such in other cultures. Nepotism, where members of the family are\npreferred to outsiders in an employment context, is an example where cultural differences could\nexplain the acceptance or tolerance of such a practice. For instance, Confucian values that advocate\nthe importance of family and familial ties are often blamed for this commonplace practice in Chinese\nsocieties. It does not follow from a practice found in a society that the philosophical foundations on\nwhich that society is founded endorse such a value. Even a cursory study of Confucianism indicates\nthe contrary, since one of the golden rules is not to cause harm to others. If viewed against this golden\nrule it is indeed difficult to rationally justify nepotism from a Confucian viewpoint.\nEmpirical studies also strongly indicate that there is no difference between Asian and Western\ncountries when it comes to the impact of corruption on lack of trust.46 According to a study by\n41 The meanings given to corruption in (5) and in (6) below are not relevant for drawing the parameters of\ncorruption for legal purposes. They are included here nonetheless since asWittgenstein (1953, paras 65\u201369)\nsays, words in ordinary language have a wide variety of meanings manifesting family resemblances.\n42 See comment in footnote above.\n43 On this subject, see Dobel (1978).\n44 See Tasioulas, 1998.\n45 To outsiders, unquestioning participation by citizens in bribe giving may come across as acceptance of\ncorruption within a particular culture. However, a distinction needs to drawn between that which is\naccepted and that which is tolerated. Personal circumstances might drive actors to tolerate a practice (for\ninstance, where the father of a sick child bribes the hospital receptionist to obtain an appointment with a\nconsultant), but it does notmean that the practice is acceptedwhere the paymentwould be seen by the giver\nand the taker as the norm. The difference between accepted cultural practices and tolerance is not a simply a\nsemantic issue. As Carney (1998) correctly notes, a high tolerance of corruption must not be confused with\ngenuine cultural practices derived from cultural identity. The former is simply bad (wrong) habit that has\ncome to be regarded as socially acceptable and justifiable; see also Hauk and Saez-Marti (2002).\n46 Anderson and Tverdova (2003); see also Bardhan (1997).\nindira carr156\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 07 Jan 2011 IP address: 131.227.169.211\nChang and Chu,47 attitudes in Asian countries are no different from those found in Western\ncountries when it comes to the negative impact of political corruption on public trust in political\ninstitutions. If the view that corruption is acceptable in Asian countries is correct, then political\ncorruption should have no impact on public trust whatsoever. But this is not so.\nWhile I am cognisant and appreciative of the fact that a universally acceptable definition is not\npossible, since what is held as morally reprehensible may vary across cultures, nonetheless there is a\nhigh degree of convergence of the standards expected of behaviour in the affairs of business, public\nsector administration and decision-making worldwide. This is attributable to a number of factors: the\nlegacy, the legal system and the machinery of government left behind by colonial powers;48 the\nharmonisation of markets through free trade and the resulting globalisation; the transplantation of\neconomic and legal systems brought about by international financial institutions such as theWorld\nBank and the International Monetary Fund;49 the information flow between countries as a result of\nthe information technology revolution; and greater democratisation.\nIn response to (b), corruption does have a moral dimension. But because an act is immoral it does\nnot follow that that act does not fall within the legal realm. One of the goals of law is to regulate\nbehaviour where it is harmful to society, even if it falls within the moral domain. There is no doubt\nabout the countless harmful effects of corruption on society, its strong link to poverty, and the\nbreakdown of the social fabric and structure. It is only right in these circumstances for the law to take\na lead in guiding human behaviour through a combination of civil and criminal law provisions,\nsanctions and remedies to bring about a reduction in acts that are socially undesirable.\nAs for (c), many states are likely to have legislation on bribery, fraud and secret profit that would\nfall squarely within what is perceived as corrupt behaviour. If corruption were geographically\ncontained within one state then there would be no problem in just relying on existing legislation.\nBut donors want donees to adopt their standards on the use or distribution of funds provided. Given\ncorruption\u2019s cross-jurisdictional character, it is important that a harmonised approach is adopted if\nwe are to increase the chances of successfully combating and preventing corruption. The criminal\nlaws of different states are unlikely to be uniform since they are founded on different legal traditions,\nthus creating variations and uncertainty. Hence there is a need for conventions, since they have the\neffect of harmonising the laws across states through consensus and the guidance of a common policy\nand framework. The expectation is that states will be willing to co-operate more readily and easily on\nprocedural issues such as exchange of information for investigation and evidential purposes and\nextradition, all necessary tools required for the enforcement of anti-corruption legislation.\nGiven the difficulties in formulating a generic definition, it comes as no surprise that regional\nand international legal instruments have simply listed the types of behaviour for the purposes of\ncriminalisation. Where a definition is provided it is narrow in scope and does not attempt to\nencompass the varieties of behaviour that could be classified as corrupt in everyday discourse listed\nabove.\nII.i The SADC Protocol\nThe PAC model, as stated earlier, has greatly influenced the policy initiatives in good governance\nadvanced by donor agencies such as theWB.While the model does not offer any specific suggestions\nin respect of offences, it has as its foundation power and its abuse in specific circumstances. When it\n47 Chang and Chu, 2006.\n48 For instance, in India there was an extensive legal framework including laws on corruption in place when\nthe British left; see Santhanam (1964).\n49 See Fine, Lapavitsas and Pincus (2001) for an interesting account of the interrelationship between state\ninstitutions and the markets.\nanti-corruption protocol and the principal\u2013agent\u2013client model 157\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 07 Jan 2011 IP address: 131.227.169.211\ncomes to corruption, the WB follows the theme set by the PAC model and defines it as the abuse or\nmisuse by a public official in a position of power of that position in the execution of his duties for\nprivate gain.50 Of the adopted conventions, regional and international, the SADC Protocol is the only\nconvention that provides a definition of corruption in Art 1 which reads:\n\u2018\u2018\u2018Corruption\u2019\u2019 means any act referred to in Article 3 and includes bribery or any other behaviour\nin relation to persons entrusted with responsibilities in the public and private sectors which\nviolates their duties as public officials, private employees, independent agents or other relation-\nships of that kind and aimed at obtaining undue advantage of any kind for themselves or others.\u2019\nIt reflects the influence of the WB approach, but goes a bit further in also bringing private-sector\ncorruption within its fold. Article 3 then goes on to list the specific acts of corruption and covers\nmore or less the same ground that other regional and international conventions do.51\nBribery52 is widely understood inmost cultures to be the commonest form of corruption and this\nis the first offence to be addressed by the SADC Protocol. In its simplest form it involves a minimum\nof two actors, the bribe taker (X) and the bribe giver (Y), and envisages a contemporaneous or a near\ncontemporaneous exchange of money for a favour, be it an act or an omission, as, for instance, where\nX accepts money from Y to destroy an application for an export licence from Y\u2019s competitor. Not all\ncases of bribery are so straightforward. X and Y may wish to distance themselves from direct contact\nintentionally in order to minimise the risk of leaving a trail (an important element for successful\ninvestigation) by involving a number of agents for the purposes of communication and the trans-\nference of funds.53 It is also possible that corrupt dealings are not necessarily restricted to money. It\nmay include gifts of various kinds such as expensive holidays, houses or sexual favours.54 It could\nalso involve an understanding that spans time and generations. For instance, X\u2019s descendants could\nbe treated in an advantageous manner by Y\u2019s descendants on the basis of the past relationship\nand tacit understanding between X and Y. Of course, the more complex the mutual undertakings and\nexchanges become through the involvement of a multitude of third parties spread over time and\nacross space, the more difficult the task of establishing connections and associated intentions\nbetween the giver and taker.\n50 See Ofusu-Amah, Soopramanien and Uprety, 1999. Transparency International adopts a slightly wider\napproach by defining it as \u2018the misuse of entrusted power for private gain\u2019 (see \u2018Frequently Asked\nQuestions\u2019 at www.transparency.org). Both of these definitions are rather restrictive in that the focus of\ntheWorld Bank definition is on the public sector and the second is on the private gain. It is possible that the\ngain is not always private but may include a non-private gain such as the funding of a political party.\n51 Other anti-corruption conventions, e.g. the AU Convention and the UN Convention, adopt a similar\napproach in focusing on the abuse, by a person in a position of power, of that position for personal gain,\nbut do not provide a definition of corruption. They simply list the acts that are regarded as offences for the\npurposes of the convention.\n52 In some countries a distinction is drawn between \u2018bribes\u2019 and \u2018facilitation payments\u2019. The latter, likened to\ntips, mean that MNCs (multinational corporations) continue to offer facilitation payments and explain\nthem away as conforming to local practices and as a way of doing business by following the local norms; see\nBayart (1993). The distinction between bribes and facilitation payments is indeed very thin but it is difficult\nto see how the latter can be justified as a legal payment, especially if the payment is a large one. But calling a\n\u2018bribe\u2019 a \u2018facilitation payment\u2019 does not change the nature of the act in any way. It depends on the value of\nthe facilitation payments and the expectations from those payments. Facilitation payments are often\nlikened to the practice of gift-giving in China. Whether the gift is bribery or not depends on the value of\nthe gift; see Tian (2004) for an interesting discussion of gift-giving in China.\n53 For an interesting account of the number of people involved in corrupt deals, see Attorney General of Zambia\nfor and on behalf of the Republic of Zambia v. Meer Care & Desai (a firm) and Ors [2007] EWHC 952 (Ch).\n54 For instance, in Tanzania sexual favours are a common form of corruption in the education sector.\nindira carr158\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 07 Jan 2011 IP address: 131.227.169.211\nThe parameters of bribery as drawn by the SADC Protocol in Art 3 bring within it active55 and\npassive56 bribery of a public official57 and envisage the use of third parties for conducting or for\nreceiving the benefits of a transaction as well as exchanges of promises, gifts and the like besides\nmoney.58 It also extends to the active bribery of a foreign public official59 and also to bribery within\nthe private sector.60\nOther than bribery, the SADC Protocol criminalises illicit gain (Art 3(1)(c)), embezzlement (Art\n3(1)(d)), trading in influence (Art 3(1)(f)) and concealing or fraudulent use of property derived from\ncriminal acts as listed in Art 3 (Art 3(1)(g)). Articles 3(1)(a) and (b) involve a minimum of two actors\nand reciprocity in that a benefit given is rewarded with a benefit obtained from a public official. The\noffence created by Art 3(1)(c) moves away from the concept of exchange. According to Art 3(1)(c),\n\u2018any act or omission in the discharge of his or her duties by a public official or any other person for\nthe purpose of illicitly obtaining benefits for himself or for a third party\u2019 is an offence. The focus of\nthis provision seems to be on the quality of the conduct of the official and illicit benefits that flow\nfrom that conduct. An illustration is perhaps the best way of understanding the kind of activity this\nprovision is likely to encompass. Where a public official sitting on a panel with authority to peruse\nconfidential science funding council documents uses the information to help his friend, a university\nvice-chancellor, in drafting a good bid for research development to the research council, an offence\nunder Art 3(1)(c) would have been committed. While the access to information is authorised it is the\nmisuse of information for obtaining illicit benefits for himself or another that is the subject of\nscrutiny under this offence.\nEmbezzlement, the misappropriation of property or funds entrusted legally to a person in their\nformal capacity, is included within its list of offences. Art 3(1)(d) makes \u2018the diversion by a public\nofficial or any other, for purposes unrelated to those for which they were intended, for his or her own\n55 Active bribery refers to the acts of offering or granting a bribe \u2013 the act of a bribe giver.\n56 Commonly understood as the solicitation or acceptance of a bribe \u2013 the act of a bribe taker.\n57 Art 1 defines \u2018public official\u2019 as:\n\u2018Any person in the employment of the State, its agencies, local authorities or parastatals and includes any person\nholding office in the legislative, executive or judicial branch of a State or exercising a public function or duty in any\nof its agencies or enterprises.\u2019\n58 Art 3(1) reads:\n\u2018This Protocol is applicable to the following acts of corruption:\n(a) the solicitation, or acceptance, directly or indirectly, by a public official, of any article of monetary\nvalue, or other benefit, such as a gift, favour, promise or advantages for himself or herself or for\nanother person or entity, in exchange for any act or omission in the performance of his or her public\nfunctions;\n(b) the offering or granting, directly or indirectly, by a public official, of any article ofmonetary value, or\nother benefit such as a gift, favour, promise or advantage for himself or herself or for another person\nor entity in exchange for any act or omission in the performance of his or her public functions.\u2019\n59 Art 6(1) states:\n\u2018Subject to its domestic law, each State Party shall prohibit and punish the offering or granting, directly or\nindirectly, by its own nationals, persons having their habitual residence in its territory, and businesses domiciled\nthere, to an official of a foreign State of any article of monetary value, or other benefit such as a gift, favour, promise\nor advantage, in connection with any economic or commercial transaction in exchange for any act or omission in\nthe performance of that official\u2019s public functions.\u2019\n60 Art 3(1) reads:\n\u2018This Protocol is applicable to the following acts of corruption:\n(a) \u2013 (d) . . .\n(e) the offering or giving, solicitation or acceptance directly or indirectly, or promising of any undue\nadvantage to or by any person who directs or works for, in any capacity, a private sector entity, for\nhimself or for anyone else, or for him or her to act, or refrain from acting, in breach of his or her\nduties.\u2019\nanti-corruption protocol and the principal\u2013agent\u2013client model 159\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 07 Jan 2011 IP address: 131.227.169.211\nbenefit or that of a third party, of any property, monies or securities belonging to the State, to an\nindependent agency, or to an individual, that such official has received by virtue of his or her\nposition for purposes of administration, custody or otherwise\u2019 an offence. So where a postmaster (A)\nuses money given to him by a client (C) for depositing in C\u2019s account to pay his (A\u2019s) son\u2019s university\nfees, A would be committing an offence under this provision. It is interesting that embezzlement is\nincluded as a separate offence. According to Akere Muna, Chairman of Transparency International\nCameroon, who was commenting on its inclusion in the context of the AU Convention in many of\nthe civil law countries, embezzlement is regarded as distinct from corruption, the latter normally\nreferring to bribery.61 Hence its inclusion as a separate offence.\nCorridors of power, be it government departments, national or international organisations, are\nfull of lobbyists putting forward the views of various interests such as the companies or non-\ngovernmental organisations that they represent. While lobbying in the corridors of power in itself\nis not an offence, Art 3(1)(f) makes the offer, solicitation or acceptance by a person to affect or\ninfluence the decision-making of a person performing functions within the public or private sector\nin return for an undue advantage for himself or anyone else an offence. So, where X offers his services\nto Z, saying that he is able to influence Y, the dean of the medical school, to offer a research post to Z\nin return for a luxury holiday in Europe for X\u2019s parents, X would have committed an offence under\nArt 3(1)(f). It is immaterial whether the supposed influence leads to the intended result.\nAn omission that stands out in the list of offences is that of illicit enrichment \u2013 the significant\nincrease in the assets of a public official or any other person which he or she cannot reasonably\nexplain in relation to his or her income. In much of Africa it is well-known that politicians and\npublic servants live beyond their means while the rest of the population live in extreme poverty. The\noffence of illicit enrichment is to be found in the OAS Convention, the AUConvention, the ECOWAS\nConvention and the UN Convention. According to this offence, the onus is on the suspect to show\nhow the assets were obtained. In most cases of corruption it is not always possible to obtain\ndocumentation or other incriminating evidence to establish an exchange of a benefit for a benefit\nor misuse of authority, and in such cases the offence of illicit enrichment provides an easier way of\nestablishing corruption on the basis of circumstantial evidence. The passage of the offence of illicit\nenrichment in conventions that include it has raised substantial criticism, since it reduces the\nburden of proof on the part of the prosecution considerably and goes against the normal expectation\nof the State having the burden to prove beyond reasonable doubt. In countries where corruption is\nwidespread and carried out with impunity the introduction of such a provision could be said to be\njustifiable since it has the potential to act as a powerful deterrent. However, there seems to be a\nserious undermining of the rights imparted by human rights instruments in respect of a fair trial. A\nnumber of the South American states (such as Argentina, Colombia, Brazil and Peru) include illicit\nenrichment as a crime in their criminal codes. By way of explanation, it has been suggested that this\nis partly due to the inability of investigation authorities in Latin American countries to conduct\ncomplex investigations.62 The US ratified the OAS Convention but has not adopted Art IX on illicit\nenrichment on the basis that it would not be consistent with the principles of the US legal system,\nthe reference being to due process.63 Maybe it is these criticisms in respect of the erosion of human\nrights obligations that have persuaded the framers of the SADC Protocol to exclude it from their\noffences. To some extent it is difficult to understand the issue, since the situation where an\nindividual with access to and in possession of wealth far beyond his capacity is comparable to an\nindividual with a blood-stained knife standing over a dead body with stab wounds on the street.

So why should the presumption be different when it\ncomes to an individual with untold wealth which is difficult to explain on the basis of his job status\nor his family background?\nA related issue that concerns corruption are activities undertaken by the recipient to conceal the\nproceeds of corruption. In instances of grand corruption, some form of laundering activity64 is likely\nto take place in an attempt to disguise the illegitimate source of wealth. Many of the countries in\nAfrica are cash economies, and against such a background it would be easy to filter money through\nthe banking system. Money laundering is by no means a localised phenomenon, it has a transna-\ntional dimension, which means that SADC countries will be perceived a low-risk area for money\nlaundering purposes due to lack of a legal infrastructure. And, according to various sources,65\nTanzania sits squarely within the money laundering routes. Other anti-corruption conventions\n(e.g. the AU Convention66) have sought to strengthen the preventative mechanism by including\nprovisions relating to money laundering (Art 6, AU Convention). The SADC Protocol is, however,\nsilent on this issue. Fortunately, some of the signatories to the SADC Protocol are also signatories to\nthe AU Convention, which means that member states should have money laundering legislation in\nplace due to the mandatory nature of the language used in Art 6.\nFunding of political parties from illicitly obtained funds is another topic that has been left out of\nthe SADC Protocol. It is not surprising that it has done so, since it is a highly controversial area and\neven with developed countries the funding of political parties has remained a thorny issue.67 What\nhas to be remembered is that the drafting of a multilateral instrument is a diplomatic process given\nto compromises in the interests of reaching consensus, acceptance, ratification and implementation.\nIn these circumstances, arriving at a comprehensive instrument that successfully includes what may\nbe regarded as sensitive provisions is indeed a gargantuan task.\nAs regional conventions go, the SADC Protocol is sound and tackles some of the common acts of\ncorruption. In doing this it reflects the foundations of the PAC model \u2013 the abuse of power by a\nperson in a position of authority and responsibility for private gain.\nIII Preventative mechanisms\nThe influence of the PAC model is further reflected in the preventative measures that the SADC\nProtocol expects of the contracting states in Art 4. These measures, listed in Table 1, are primarily\n64 This is not unique to corruption. It is associated with other types of crimes such as drug trafficking, illegal\narms trade and human trafficking. Layering is one of themost commonways to laundermoney, wheremoney\nin small amounts is deposited in a number of accounts and may be held in different names and in different\ncountries. The monies may also be converted into various items such as jewelry which may be subsequently\nsold at auctions. For more on the topic of money laundering, see Alldridge (2003); Gilmore (2004).\n65 See Bagenda, 2003.\n66 Art 6 of the AU Convention reads:\n\u2018State Parties shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal offences:\n(a) The conversion, transfer or disposal of property, knowing that such property is the proceeds of\ncorruption or related offences for the purpose of concealing or disguising the illicit origin of the\nproperty or of helping any person who is involved in the commission of the offence to evade the\nlegal consequences of his or her action.\n(b) The concealment or disguise of the true nature, source, location, disposition, movement or owner-\nship of or rights with respect to property which is the proceeds of corruption or related offences;\n(c) The acquisition, possession or use of property with the knowledge at the time of receipt, that such\nproperty is the proceeds of corruption or related offences.\u2019\n67 See, for instance, Gay, White and Kelly, 2007.\nanti-corruption protocol and the principal\u2013agent\u2013client model 161\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 07 Jan 2011 IP address: 131.227.169.211\nTable 1 Preventative measures (accountability, openness, integrity and participation) in\nSADC Protocol\nAccountability and\nopenness measures Integrity measures\nParticipation and\neducation\nDeterrence and\nenforcement\nCreation, maintenance\nand strengthening of\nsystems in the hiring\nand procurement of\ngoods and services\nthat ensure\ntransparency, equity\nand efficiency of\nsuch systems\n(Art 4(1)(b)).\nCreation, maintenance\nand strengthening of\ncodes of conduct for\nthe correct,\nhonourable and\nproper fulfilment of\npublic functions (Art\n4(1)(a)).\nMechanisms to\nencourage\nparticipation of\nmedia, civil society\nand non-\ngovernmental\norganisations\n(Art 4(1)(i)).\nIntroduction of\nmechanism for\nenforcing standards\nof conduct expected\nin the fulfilment of\npublic functions (Art\n4(1)(a)).\nMechanisms to\npromote access to\ninformation to\nfacilitate eradication\nand elimination of\nopportunities for\ncorruption (Art\n4(1)(d)).\nMechanism for\npromoting public\neducation and\nawareness in the\nfight against\ncorruption (Art\n4(1)(j)).\nStrengthen revenue\ncollection and\ncontrol systems that\ndeter corruption (Art\n4(1)(c)).\nProtection of\ninformants\/witnesses\n(Art 4(1)(e)) and\nintroduction of laws\nfor punishing those\nwho make malicious\nreports against\ninnocent persons (Art\n4(10(f)).\nCreation of institutions\nresponsible for\nimplementing\nmechanisms for\npreventing, detecting,\npunishing and\neradicating\ncorruption (Art\n4(1)(g)).\nTax law reforms that\ndeny favourable tax\ntreatment for\nindividual or\ncorporation for\nexpenditures made in\nviolation of anti-\ncorruption laws (Art\n4(1)(c)).\nindira carr162\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 07 Jan 2011 IP address: 131.227.169.211\naimed at public sector reform through the introduction of accountability and openness and the\nraising of integrity within the civil service while building in mechanisms for participation by civil\nsociety and the media,68 the education of the public and the adoption of suitable deterrent and\nenforcementmechanisms. In adopting thesemeasures, the approach of the SADC Protocol converges\nwith those found, for instance, in the UN Convention69 and the AU Convention.70\nMany of the SADC member countries are also parties to other conventions, the AU Convention\nand the UN Convention, that are guided by the PACmodel. As a result, they have been reforming the\npublic sector71 to increase accountability, transparency and integrity and have taken measures to\nspread the word about the evil effects of corruption and to empower citizens and NGOs72 to take\naction through awareness-raising programmes. Tanzania is one of these, and in the carrying out of\nthis process it has received extensive help from donor agencies such as the WB, the DFID, the\nDANIDA (Danish International Development Agency), the SIDA (Swedish International\nDevelopment Agency)73 and NORAD (Norwegian Agency for Development). Tanzania is perceived\nfavourably by these agencies74 and since the 1990s has emerged as one of the biggest recipients of\nfunding within sub-Saharan Africa.75 The donor agencies have taken on an active role (often\ndescribing themselves as partners) in providing advice and know-how for effecting such changes.\nMaintenance of books,\nrecords in reasonable\ndetail to reflect\naccurately the\nacquisition and\ndisposal of assets on\nthe part of publicly\nheld companies and\nother associations,\nand sufficient\ninternal accounting\ncontrols to enable\ndetection of\ncorruption (Art\n4(1)(h)).\n(# Indira Carr 2008)\n68 The media in the form of newspapers have always been a powerful way of canvassing public opinion; see\nBoissier (1906).

Central to this policy was\nnationalisation (public ownership) and the creation of Ujamaa villages, socialist organisations that\nwould be run by those who lived and worked in the village. The policy of Ujamaa (co-operation or\nfamily-hood) was to develop the people and its objective was \u2018threefold: the delivery of services; the\ncreation of a more productive, modern agriculture; and the encouragement of communal, socialist\nforms of co-operation\u2019.77 Despite this commendable ideological focus on the welfare and develop-\nment of the community at large, the country in the 1970s faced a huge economic crisis which saw tax\nincreases, parastatal (state) trading corporations monopolising the distribution of basic commodities\nsuch as food and oil, the introduction of lengthy bureaucratic processes, restrictions on the move-\nment of grain across districts, and the adoption of other austerity measures including the loss of\nemployment tenure for state employees and curbs on the movements of people in private transport\non public holidays. The cost of living spiralled upwards out of control and petty corruption became\ncommonplace since huge numbers of state employees sought to supplement their official wages\nthrough bribes. The aid that was coming in from theNordic countries was insufficient toward off the\nfailing economy.\nTheUjamaa programme itself was under scrutiny since vast numbers of people, resettled in areas\nwhere the ecological and climatic patterns were different, found that they could not apply their\ntraditional agricultural knowledge to the land they had been provided with. They also reacted\nvociferously to the demands to grow crops that were labour intensive. Protests were swiftly dealt\nwith by TANU (the African National Union) who had no hesitation is using violence when needed.\nWhat had started off as a voluntary programme ended up becoming coercive.78\nThe economic crisis did not take a turn for the better in the 1980s. The IMF proposed pro-\ngrammes of economic liberalisation to enable improvements in the economy met with stubborn\nresistance from President Nyerere, since they offended the socialist vision for Tanzania. The country\nmanaged to struggle through this difficult period due to the trickle of aid from the Scandinavian\ndonors. Amidst growing economic crisis Nyerere stepped down and in 1985 Ali Hassan Mwinyi\nbecame president.79 Soon after Tanzania reached an agreement with the IMF which included the\ndevaluation of the Tanzanian currency. Aid from the IMF and other donors started flowing, though\nantipathy towards the liberalisation policies remained amongst the staunch supporters of the\nsocialist policies.\nLiberalisation brought with it its own problems, rampant corruption being one of them. Bribes\nfrom businesses to the political elite and senior civil servants in order to facilitate trade in the form of\nthe import of goods and foreign investments became commonplace. Tanzania had sought to\nmodernise its anti-corruption laws in the 1970s with its Prevention of Corruption Act 1971,80 but\nthis proved to be largely ineffective due to lack of enforcement. The early 1990s was a watershed for\n76 Often called the blueprint for African socialism.\n77 Scott, 1998.\n78 See Scott (1998) for an interesting account of villagisation in Tanzania.\n79 Collier, 1991.\n80 Act No 16 of 1971. This legislation underwent periodic amendments. Part II of the Act sets out the functions\nof the Prevention of Corruption Bureau and imparts various powers to its members, which include powers\nof arrest and the seizing of assets.\nindira carr164\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 07 Jan 2011 IP address: 131.227.169.211\ncorruption with a number of high-profile cases involving tax abuse and customs duties exemptions,\nwhich had been set up for encouraging foreign investment, and the Chavda scandal.81 These large\ncorruption scandals in the public sector caused a huge outcry, both at home and abroad,82 regarding\nthe government\u2019s level of commitment to curbing corruption and upholding the cornerstones of\ngood governance (e.g. transparency and accountability) in the public sector.\nThe eradication of corruption and the introduction of good governance therefore emerged as\nimportant issues in the elections, and Benjamin Mkapa made these the core issues in his election\ncampaign. Upon becoming president he set up in 1996 the Presidential Commission, under the\nchairmanship of the Honourable Joseph S. Warioba, to look into the causes of corruption.\nThe Report of this Commission (often called the Warioba Commission) was published in\nNovember 1996. The Warioba Report found that those who receive and solicit bribes fell within\ntwo groups: (1) low-income employees who engage in petty corruption; and (2) the political elite and\npublic servants who, despite earnings adequate to meet their needs, engage in grand corruption.\nAccording to this Report, the high incidence of corruption during the 1970s and early part of 1980s\nwas more of the petty kind, for example bribes for expediting the issue of a driving permit, the\nopening of a new file by a court clerk, the issuing of a trading licence, and gaining access to the basic\nnecessities of life such as water or electricity connections. It permeated all government departments\nfrom education, health, home affairs, finance, judiciary, trade, employment, land, natural resources\nand labour to local governments.83 Themid 1980s, however, saw a new form of corruption develop as\na result of trade liberalisation, with opportunities for bribes in business-related transactions (for\nexample in the setting up of factories and licences for foreign investment), thus opening the doors for\ngrand corruption. It permeated the upper rungs of society, including the decision-making ruling\nelite, thus resulting in a marked growth in the incidence of high-level scandals confirming many of\nthe widely held views about the state of governance and corruption in Tanzania.\nThe Warioba Report made a number of recommendations aimed at the leaders, public servants,\nbusinesses and the people. These included:\n(1) cleaning up existing leadership and developing ethical standards for future leaders;\n(2) clear demarcation of responsibilities between the executive officer of ministries, departments\nand parastatals and ministers and members of boards of directors in order to enable\naccountability;\n(3) vetting officers employed in sensitive areas such as home affairs,\n(4) employment based on merit;\n(5) declaration of assets and gifts received by leaders and public officials;\n(6) severe punishment in the form of nationalisation and forfeiture of property of \u2018big givers of\nbribes\u2019 (i.e. persons involved in grand corruption);\n(7) adopting programmes that raise awareness in the public of their rights; and\n(8) a role for the media in exposing corruption and in educating the public.\nAfter the publication of the Warioba Report a National Anti-Corruption Strategy and Action Plan\n(NACSAP) was approved by Parliament in 1999,84 which identified seven priority areas of strategy as\nfollows:\n81 For more on this see, for instance, \u2018Chavda\u2019s Scandal: CRDB to Lose 900m\u2019, Business Times 15\u201321 October\n1993.\n82 Mwinyi was widely referred to as \u2018Mzee Ruksa\u2019 in Kiswahili, translated as \u2018With my permission\u2019, due to the\nrampant corruption, both petty and grand; see Kiley (1994).\n83 The United Republic of Tanzania, 1996, pp. 1\u201315.\n84 President\u2019s Office, 1999.\nanti-corruption protocol and the principal\u2013agent\u2013client model 165\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 07 Jan 2011 IP address: 131.227.169.211\n(1) Rule of law and legal framework \u2018intended to facilitate sectoral laws review and create conditions\nnecessary for the restoration of confidence in the judiciary and law enforcement agencies\u2019;\n(2) Financial discipline and management in order to \u2018reduce and eradicate siphoning of public finds\nby unfaithful officials and increase revenue collection\u2019;\n(3) Transparency in procurement administration and procedures;\n(4) Education of public to harmful effects of corruption on the economy and social values and\ncreation of awareness of rights;\n(5) Public service reform that recognises the accountability of public officers and fair remuneration\npackage for their services;\n(6) Protection of informers in order \u2018to encourage citizens to co-operate\u2019; and\n(7) Support of the media so that they can report the \u2018corrupt elements without fear or favour and to\npublicise the harm they do to the innocent, the poor and the weak in Tanzania\u2019.85\nThe NACSAP recognised that the judiciary and the legal system was a central pillar in ensuring\nequality and the fair treatment of its citizens and that existing outdated, cumbersome and non-\ntransparent laws needed to be reviewed and updated so that the resulting framework reflected \u2018the\ngovernment\u2019s policy of transparent, equal, fair and effective treatment and provision of services to\nthe public\u2019.86 Equally it recognised that the law enforcement agencies needed to be strengthened\nalong with improving the interface between civil society and the government in order to combat\ncorruption.\nThe co-ordination of the anti-corruption strategy was to rest with the Minister of State, Good\nGovernance in the President\u2019s Office. The Permanent Secretaries or Chief Executive Officers in the\nvarious ministries and other state agencies and institutions were to have responsibility for imple-\nmenting the various anti-corruption policies, including the adoption of codes of conduct.\nSince the publication of the NACSAP87 a number of reforms (institutional and management\nprocesses) have been undertaken. A Good Governance Co-ordination Unit (GGCU) was established\nin 2001 to implement the NACSAP, with a reporting system enabling the different Ministries and\nIndependent Departments and Agencies (MDAs) to provide details of registered complaints on\ncorruption and unethical behaviour, self-assessment of performance and outputs achieved (e.g.\nimprovement in public service delivery, transparency and accountability mechanisms, adoption of\na code of ethics) on a periodic basis with a quarterly report and target setting for the next quarter. A\nsummary of these reports is regularly published as the Quarterly Monitoring Reports. An Ethics\nInspectorate Department was also set up with the Public Service Management Department with\nresponsibility to enforce the Leadership Code of Ethics.88\nAlongside these institutions, Tanzania further strengthened its existing anti-corruption enforce-\nment authority, the Anti-Corruption Squad, which had been established by the Prevention of\nCorruption Act 1971 and Government Notice No. 17 of 1975 to deal with the growth of corruption\nin the 1970s. In 1991, the Ministry of Home Affairs took over responsibility for this squad and\nrenamed it the Prevention of Corruption Bureau (PCB). The PCB assumed both investigative and\npreventative roles and in this capacity investigated allegations of corruption, prosecuted directly or\nreferred alleged corruption cases to the Director of Public Prosecutions, educated members of the\n85 President\u2019s Office, 1999, pp. 10\u201311.\n86 President\u2019s Office, 1999, p. 15.\n87 A further version of the NACSAP (known as NACSAP II) was adopted in 2006, and expands the scope of\ngovernance to include local government authorities, civil society and the private sector.\n88 The UNDP (United Nations Development Programme) has been providing a great deal of assistance to\nTanzania on setting up schemes for good governance; see \u2018UNDP Case Studies in Anti-Corruption Tanzania\u2019,\navailable at www.undp.org.\nindira carr166\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 07 Jan 2011 IP address: 131.227.169.211\npublic about the effects of corruption and trained government departments and state-owned orga-\nnisations on both the detection and prevention of corruption. It also has a research division that\nplays an important role in identifying corruption-prone areas. After the Warioba Report, the Bureau\nreceived a massive injection of funds along with offices being opened in a number of regions and\nsince then has seen a gradual expansion of staff.\nThe Bureau underwent further changes as a result of the Prevention and Combating of\nCorruption Act 2007 (PCA 2007).89 The newly adopted Prevention of Corruption Act set out in detail\nthe role of the Bureau, now renamed the Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB)90\nand the powers of the Director General in Part II of the Act, and Part III deals with the establishment\nof the Prevention and Combating of Corruption Board91 (PCCBd), whose function is to advise the\nPCCB on any matter relating to corruption and to reviewmatters such as staffing and administrative\npolicies as well as to consider the annual reports of the PCCB. Though it is too early to form any\nopinions of the effectiveness of establishing the Board, what is interesting is its constituency. Its\nmembership is to include a representative from civil society92 and from the private sector.\nIII.ii Reforms \u2014 a success?\nOn paper all the recipes for good governance based on the rational-legal model and advanced by the\nWorld Bank and donor agencies are present in Tanzania.93 In spite of all these commendable efforts\nin updating legislation and introducing changes within the public sector, seen by many as an\n\u2018excellent example\u2019,94 a reference to data sent by the PCB to the GGCU indicates that despite a\nhigh number of corruption cases being reported there are hardly any prosecutions. Even the Second\nQuarterly Monitoring Report, for instance from 2005, presents a bleak picture when it notes:\n\u2018The number of cases going through the PCB system is in the thousands. For instance, the number\nof cases carried over plus those reported\/detected during the quarter by the PCB stands at\n8586 . . . Investigation files formally opened were 219, cases sent to court were 18 . . .\nIt is worth noting that in spite of themany cases being brought to the attention of PCB, only a\nfew (in absolute terms) are finding their way to the end of the cycle.\u201995\nThe picture that emerges from corruption surveys is no different. According to Transparency\nInternational (TI), Tanzania is highly corrupt. A comparison of the scores for Tanzania on its corrup-\ntion perceptions indices for the past five years, set out in Table 2, show no marked improvement\ndespite the major incursions into public reform based on expertise from the various donor agencies.96\n89 Act No 1 of 2007.\n90 Act No 1 of 2007, s.5.\n91 S.15 PCA 2007.\n92 Most of the civil society organisations in Tanzania were established during the colonial period but there has\nbeen a gradual growth in the number of civil society organisations. According to the Tanzania Chapter of\nAPNAC (African Parliamentarians Network Against Corruption), there are now well over 6,000 NGOs in\nTanzania; see APNAC Tanzania (2006)\n93 See United Republic of Tanzania, 2004, pp. 11\u201362; Mutahaba, 2005; Office of the Controller and Auditor\nGeneral Tanzania, 1999; Anti-Corruption Bureau and the Presidential Inquiry Commission Against\nCorruption, 1996; Good Governance Coordination Unit, 2002.\n94 According to a recent news item the UK International Development Secretary Hilary Benn hailed Tanzania\u2019s\nprogress and announced that the UK would provide \u00a3105 million of direct budget to support Tanzania\nduring 2007\u20132008. Tanzania is DFID\u2019s biggest recipient of funding; see News Item (2007a).\n95 GGCU, 2005, pp. 20\u201321. A similar picture also emerges in other quarterly reports.\n96 Transparency International (TI) is an NGO devoted to fighting corruption, and since the 1990s has been\npublishing a corruption perceptions index on an annual basis. It uses a score ranging from 1 (high\ncorruption) to 10 (low corruption); for more on TI visit www.transparency.org.\nanti-corruption protocol and the principal\u2013agent\u2013client model 167\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 07 Jan 2011 IP address: 131.227.169.211\nOther surveys also do not show in overall terms any major improvements in Tanzania. For\ninstance the Afro Barometer survey also indicates that while the government may have dealt with\npetty corruption to some extent in a positive manner, corruption at the upper level (that is, grand\ncorruption) still continues with judges, police, tax officials, health officials and government officials\nperceived as highly corrupt.97\nThis failure to bring about a major shift for the better in the perception of corruption inevitably\nraises the questions, \u2018Why despite all the assistance are we not seeing a marked improvement in\nTanzania?Why are the expectations not beingmet?\u2019 Oneway this question can be fruitfully explored\nis in the following terms: \u2018Why is there no sense of ownership on the part of Tanzanians?\u2019 This lack of\nownership, I believe, is attributable to a number of reasons ranging from donor policies and\ndonor\u2013donee dynamics to the colonial past.\nSince the collapse of communism, the development agenda has taken on a new hue, resulting in\na vigorous push on the part of the international financial institutions (IFIs) and other donor agencies\nto superimpose a structure whose tone is largely driven by neoliberal capitalist ideology. While the\nmotivations and objectives ofWestern donors may vary, their views in respect of how to bring about\neconomic reforms, and through that poverty alleviation, converge.98 These economic reforms\ninclude, besides the removal of trade barriers, reform in the public sector, namely transparency,\nintegrity, accountability, the privatisation of public services and greater competition. Themodel that\nis transplanted onto the donee is essentially a Western one and there is an undisguised \u2018tendency\ntoward the universalising of Western norms and values\u2019.99 There is no attempt on the part of the\ndonors to fit the model to the historical, social, political and cultural ethos that underpins a donee\nstate, thus contributing to a lack of indigenous ownership. Some have gone on to say that this is a\nmodern form of colonialism or neo-colonialism. For instance, William De Maria rightly questions\nthe assumptions made by the donor community and their failure to even engage in exploring or\nunderstanding \u2018corruption\u2019 in its indigenous context, which can be extremely complex. As he aptly\nobserves:\n\u2018Western anti-corruption engagements in Africa too often appear oblivious to this argument,\npreferring to intervene through a portal that proclaims \u2018\u2018corruption\u2019\u2019 a universally nasty issue.\n\u2018\u2018Corruption,\u2019\u2019 through Western eyes, is HIV-like, a trans-cultural \u2018\u2018disease\u2019\u2019 that must be surgi-\ncally removed from all sovereign states.\u2019100\nFurther evidence for the view that the donors are the primary drivers of policy-making within\nTanzania is provided by Graham Harrison\u2019s empirical study on donors and public-sector reform.\nAccording to Harrison, donor sub-groups have meetings with the permanent secretaries of various\nministries on a regular basis \u2018to discuss policy progress, the disbursement of funds and consider\nfurther funding options. These meetings have become a routine part of the way the government\nworks, and the higher echelons of the civil service regularly produce information for donors \u2013 both\nTable 2 TI scores for Tanzania 2004\u20132009\nYear 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008\nTI Score 2.8 2.9 2.9 3.2 3.0\n97 REPOA, 2006.

Harrison\u2019s field study also\nmakes some disturbing observations about the failure of the donors to report cases of corruption for\na number of reasons ranging from failure of donor governance policies in countries that have been\ncherrypicked as showcases103 to the deterioration of mutually dependent relations between donors\nand donee states. He writes:\n\u2018Other donors, enjoying close and routinized working relations with debtor states, also fight shy\nof the sensitive issue of corruption. More candid interviewees said that donors know about\ncorrupt practices \u2013 such as officials with a row of luxury apartments which they could have never\npaid for from the public servant\u2019s salary \u2013 but demur from acting on these cases because of the\nrepercussion this would have on the overall donor\u2013state relationship.\n. . . But the anti-corruption agenda is mademore complex by the mutual (albeit still unequal)\ndependence between donors and debtor state: to identify serious corruption at the highest\nechelons of the state would be to disrupt the post-conditionality regime, with its image of\npartnership, progress and claims of show case status.\u2019104\nUnwittingly, the donor agencies, in their enthusiastic drive towards economic liberalisation and\nderegulation, may have also created new opportunities for corruption. The privatisation of the state\nsector, for instance, has been an important source of illicit enrichment, and as Williams correctly\nobserves, \u2018in many cases, privatisation amounted to no more than the licensed theft of state\nproperty\u2019,105 thus entrenching rather than solving the already corrupt focus of the political elite.\nIt should also come as no surprise in a heavily aid-dependent country such as Tanzania that the\nWorld Bank and other institutions in their capacity as donors are seen as lucrative sources for illicit\nenrichment by the political and business elite groups within the country, with the result that the\nstate often makes reform proposals to attract donor funding.106\nThe shift in political ideology in Tanzania, as we saw earlier, was not brought about by the\ndomestic economic crisis or through international pressure. It is no accident that donor-led reforms,\nlegal or otherwise, came to be widely seen as an imposed alien construct to further Western\n101 See Harrison, 2001.\n102 According to Therkildsen (2000, p. 66), in many instances the State may request the help of the donor\nagencies for technical assistance in drafting the policy, which explains \u2018the observation that many senior\nofficials and ministers do not take an active part in the policy making process. As principals assessing the\nquality of the policy work, they need only ascertain that their subordinate agents help to produce policy\npapers that attract donor funding. This is a key indicator of a job well done.\u2019\n103 According to Raikes and Gibbon (1996), donors have played down corruption in Tanzania due to its\nshowcase status.\n104 Harrison, 2001, p. 673.\n105 Williams, 2000, p. xii; see also Hall, 1999. In a similar vein Holmes (2006), in his comparative study\n(focusing on Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Russia and China) states that neoliberalism is a primary factor in\nthe rise of corruption. In his reasoning the post-communist countries lacked cultural norms, the necessary\nregulatory mechanisms and the ethical guidelines required for decision-making. At times, the interna-\ntional financial institutions have used low proceeds from privatisation as a reason for suspending aid. The\nIMF stopped aid to Kenya on this basis and imposed a number of conditions for resuming aid. These\nincluded increased privatisation and establishing an anti-corruption authority; see Kamau (2001); Human\nRights Watch (2002).\n106 For more on the complex dynamics and examples from various African countries, see Therkildsen (2000;\n2001).\nanti-corruption protocol and the principal\u2013agent\u2013client model 169\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 07 Jan 2011 IP address: 131.227.169.211\ncapitalistic interests in a young independent country. The paternalistic approach, by backing\ndemands for reform with threats and sanctions, does not do much to dispel any doubts one may\nhave about the ownership of the reform programme in Tanzania. Loans were suspended in the mid\n1990s when Tanzania did not meet the demands to discontinue tax exemption to people of influence\nin politics. This mechanism of stopping payments continues to this day, in spite of the \u2018working in\npartnership\u2019 speak adopted by the donor agencies. In 2006, Denmark cut US$3.16 million in aid to\nTanzania because of the slow pace of the Anti-Corruption Bill. Denmark\u2019s envoy, Carsten Pedersen, is\nreported as having said, \u2018[f]rommy perspective it is a contract which has been broken. If Tanzaniamet\nthis target, they would get the money.\u2019107 Tanzania passed the Anti-Corruption Bill in 2007 and since\nthen Tanzanian anti-corruption efforts have been feted by donor agencies as a great success,108 with\npromises of further funding.109 There is no doubt that Tanzania\u2019s co-operation in undertaking\nreforms is largely donor driven. The donors\u2019 message, which smacks of paternalism, is \u2018If you act\nupon what we require you to do we will lend monies to you. If not, then we will not. If you do not\nperform as per the terms we will cut the funding.\u2019 What the donors have overlooked is that\nTanzania\u2019s initial rejection of help from IFIs indicated a deep-rooted sense of sovereignty, a sense\nthat still pervades ex-colonies to this day regardless of globalisation. The donor\u2019s paternalistic\nattitude, backed by sanctions, only rekindles that sense of sovereignty and an unwillingness to\ntake ownership of strategies thrust upon them by others.110 The carrot and stick approach simply\nreinforces the view held in many donee countries that the IMF, theWB and other donor agencies are\nsimply engines feeding Western interests. Against this, the dynamics between the donors and\nrecipients can hardly be said to be collegial in character where there is free and fair collaboration\non an equal footing.\nThe intimate involvement of the donor agencies in policy-making, where indigenous voices of\nthe state institutions are geared to reflect donor policies, simply reawakens in the donee state the\nrecent colonial past where the ruler was divorced from his subjects and no attempt was made to let\nthe subjects participate in the decision-making process.111 Hence De Maria\u2019s observation that fight-\ning corruption in Africa is yet another neocolonial adventure.\nThe above reasons provide food for thought. How should we go about introducing the reforms in\ndonee countries so that they take ownership and see it as their strategy and not as one that is imposed\nand backed by threats? The answer lies in how we situate the problem and the solution. There is no\ndoubt that the PACmodel provides a feasible strategy for preventing corruption. Mere semantics, e.g.\npartnership speak, alone will not resolve the issue and impart that sense of ownership, as we have\nseen. The problem and the strategies need to be placed against the country\u2019s culture, historical,\npolitical and social, and the economics and the knowledge gathered from this exercise needs to be\nbuilt into the model to provide a solution that is tailor-made for that country. A return to the pre-\ncolonial past of the country may provide some clues as to how acting in the interests of the\ncommunity at large is a core principle if anti-corruption strategies are to become an integral part in\nthe ethos of a country. There are ample studies which indicate that corrupt practices and notions of\npersonal property came with the colonisers and were introduced via the tax-collection system set up\n107 See Obulutsa, 2006.\n108 See News Item, 2007b.\n109 What, however, is overlooked is that Tanzania is simply increasing its debts by drawing upon funding from\ndonor agencies. Even though the term \u2018aid\u2019 is commonly used by donor agencies it is not aid as commonly\nunderstood, that is support or help where there is no expectation of receiving anything in return. Much of\nthe aid provided are loans where the recipient is expected to pay interest (at perhaps less thanmarket rates)\nand the capital. Other types of aid come in the form of technical assistance and grants.\n110 See Baaz (2005) for an interesting account of identities.\n111 Heilman, Kamata and Ndumbaro, 2000; Rodney, 1972.\nindira carr170\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 07 Jan 2011 IP address: 131.227.169.211\nby the British, for instance, in Tanzania in order to meet administration costs and the costs of\nemploying African labour. The British used intermediaries, normally the chiefs and tribal leaders\n(whohad hitherto acted for the good of the community and acted as custodians of public property),112\nfor the collection of taxes.113 They were allowed to retain a percentage of the tax collected, a practice\nno different from kickbacks, thus sowing the seeds of corrupt practices within a country and\ncontinent that a few centuries later the Western nations would be fighting to eradicate. According\nto Heilman, Kamata and Ndumbaro:\nColonialism broke the organic link between the society and their leaders and replaced it with a\nstate that lorded over its subject. Where the colonial state used existing chiefs, they were\naccountable to European officials rather than their own communities . . .The British introduced\nindirect rule, whereby chiefs and jumbes [administrators] were used to help in administration and\ncollection of taxes. Tax collectors, including chiefs, used to retain a certain amount of tax\nmoney . . .Thus, the colonial state reoriented methods traditionally used by the society to hold\nits leaders accountable and set the stage for unaccountable public officials.\u2019114\nIt seems that to impart ownership of the reform programmes we need to revisit and rekindle the\norganic link that existed between the leader and his community and revise it to suit a modern nation\nwhere boundaries are not on tribal and clan lines. Somehow the citizens of the nation, whatever their\ntribal affiliation, and their democratically elected leaders need to perceive this organic link and the\nneed to act for the good of the community. One possible way of achieving this is to involve civil\nsociety in this quest for indigenising the reform structures put in place for combating corruption.\nThe donors\u2019 engagement must involve the various stakeholders, including the participation of civil\nsociety, in the process of introducing changes. Otherwise the donor agencies are doing no more than\nreflecting the structures present in the colonial past.\nThe solution then will no longer be perceived as an alien construct but as an indigenous\ncontribution coming from within the community. This is where \u2018working in partnership\u2019 takes on\na fresh meaning. It does not simply mean technical co-operation and direct intervention with policy-\nmaking by foreigners but a true engagement with the political, historical and social antecedents of a\ncountry and the participation of the intellectuals, the ruling elite and the people of that State to\narrive at a truly tailor-made solution that that State and its people can come to accept as their own\nand hence internalise for guiding their behaviour. It also reinforces their pride in their country and\n112 For more on this aspect, see Rodney (1980).\n113 See Collier and Lal, 1986. According to Tlou and Campbell (1984), in Botswana (previously known as\nBechuanaland) the digkosi (chief) retained 10 percent of the tax collected, thus introducing the practice of\naccumulating private property and acting as an incentive to ignore the needs of their community. Similar\nviews emerge from writers such as Mulengi and Lesetedi (1998, pp. 21\u201322) who state:\n\u2018the administrative culture inherited from . . .Africa\u2019s colonial past has facilitated and entrenched\ncorrupt practices especially amongst the higher echelons of politicians and administrative bureau-\ncracies. Of particular significance is the adherence by Africa\u2019s new political elites to what we call the\n\u2018\u2018African chief model\u2019\u2019 of administration which dates back to the colonial period . . . [P]re-colonial chiefs\nhad limited and controlled powers but colonialism reinforced the chief\u2019s powers by giving them new\npowers and occasional payment that translated the chiefs into agents of colonialism.\nThe attainment of independence by African countries did not end this \u2018\u2018colonial chief\u2019\u2019 model of\nadministration. The leadership style adopted by African political and administrative elites after inde-\npendence reveals a strong resemblance to this model . . . Like the colonial chief, these leaders have been\nassociated with authoritarianism and, most important, an almost total lack of respect for the law and\ndue process. In addition they have used their positions of power to amass illegal wealth just like the\ncolonial chief.\u2019\nSee also Nabudere (1981); Nkrumah (1980); Osaba (1996).\n114 Heilman, Kamata and Ndumbaro, 2000, p. 500.\nanti-corruption protocol and the principal\u2013agent\u2013client model 171\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 07 Jan 2011 IP address: 131.227.169.211\nfeelings of sovereignty. The finding of such synergies is also likely to contribute to the successful\nimplementation of the anti-corruption conventions.\nGrass-roots activism is likely to take a greater part in helping to build a better future in the\nAfrican continent with the recently formed Economic, Social and Cultural Council (ECOSOCC) of\nthe African Union (AU) which is meant to be the \u2018people powered arm\u2019 of the AU. And according to\nAkere Muna (the incoming presiding officer and vice-chair of TI) the work of pushing the issues will\nstart now.115\nConclusion\nThe PACmodel has influenced: (1) the perception of corruption as the abuse or misuse of power by a\npublic official in the execution of his duties for private gain in the anti-corruption conventions; (2)\nthe preventative mechanisms advocated by the conventions, namely the infusion of accountability,\nintegrity and transparency in the public sector; and (3) the international financial institutions and\ndonor agencies to transpose the PAC model in donee countries as part of the good governance\nagenda.\nWhat emerges from a study of Tanzania, a signatory to the SADC Protocol, the AU Convention\nand the UN Convention, and a major recipient of loans and technical co-operation from donor\nagencies in introducing public-sector reform as part of its anti-corruption strategy, is that corruption\nas yet continues at the grand level. It remains to be seen how the 2007 Act and the recently adopted\nNACSAP II will change the picture. This paper has argued that the problem lies in the dogmatic\nassertion and transposition of a Western construct by donors and a failure to build a bespoke\nsolution with the ingredients of the PAC model against the historical, political and social backdrop\nof the country in question. It is in tackling that issue head on that the hope of progress lies.\nReferences\nackerman, John (2003) \u2018State\u2013Society Synergy for Accountability: Beyond \u2018\u2018Exit\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Voice\u2019\u2019\u2019, World\nDevelopment 32(3): 447\u201363.\nalatas, Syed Hussein (1990) Corruption, Its Nature, Causes and Functions.
