INTRODUCTION \nDiscrete-time differentiators have many important applications in physics and \nengineering [1]. In particular, they are used to obtain a set of data relating to the rate \nof change of some physical quantities, such as the estimation of heating rates from \ntemperature data, net flow rates of fluid from measurements of volume level, and \nvelocity from position data, etc. \n 3\nTwo common methods for the design of discrete-time differentiators are based \non the eigen approach [2] and the Remez algorithm approach [3]. However, the eigen \napproach does not guarantee the obtained solution satisfying the required \nspecifications. On the other hand, the Remez algorithm approach would result to a \ndiscrete-time differentiator with large ripple energy. To address this problem, the \ndiscrete-time differentiator design problem is formulated as a peak constraint least \nsquare optimization problem. That is, the total weighted square error of the magnitude \nresponse is minimized subject to the peak constraint of the weighted error function \n[4]-[6]. Although this problem formulation provides a great flexibility for the tradeoff \nbetween the ripple energy and the ripple magnitude of the discrete-time differentiator, \nthis optimization problem is actually a semi-infinite programming problem. The \ncommon method for solving semi-infinite programming problems is via the \nsemi-definite programming approach [4]. That is, the continuous constraints are \ndiscretized into finite number of discrete constraints. However, this approach does not \nguarantee that the continuous constraints are satisfied among the discretization points. \nAlthough the deviation between the continuous constraints and the discrete constraints \ncan be reduced by increasing the number of discretization points, the exact number of \ndiscretization points required for the optimization problem is unknown and the \nincrease in the number of discrete constraints will result to the increase of the \ncomputational complexity. Although new primal quadratic programming approach \nwas proposed for solving the problem [5], the convergence of the algorithm is not \nguaranteed. In this paper, the dual parameterization algorithm is employed for solving \nthe problem [6]. The semi-infinite programming problem is reduced to a sequence of \napproximating sub-problems followed by a nonlinear finite programming problem. \nEach of the approximating sub-problems can be readily solved by quadratic \nprogramming. The global solution of the finite nonlinear program can then be \n 4\nobtained from the approximated solution. If the feasible set is nonempty, then an exact \noptimal solution is guaranteed. Also, the convergence of the algorithm is proved. \nMoreover, since the total number of the finite constraints in the approximating \nsub-problems is smaller than that of the corresponding semi-definite programming \nproblems, the computational complexity is low. \nThe outline of this paper is as follows. In Section II, the optimum discrete-time \ndifferentiator design problem is formulated as a semi-infinite programming problem. \nThe dual parameterization algorithm is summarized in Section III. The computer \nnumerical simulation results are presented in Section IV. Finally, a conclusion is \ndrawn in Section V. \n \nII.

(15) \nClearly, ( )\u03c9A  and ( )\u03c9c  are continuously differentiable with respect to \ndB\u2208\u03c9 . Consequently, the optimum discrete-time differentiator design problem can \nbe formulated as the following semi-infinite programming problem: \nProblem (P) \nx\nmin   ( ) pJ TT ++= xbxQxx\n2\n1 ,     (16a) \nsubject to  0cxAxg \u2264\u2212= )()(),( \u03c9\u03c9\u03c9 , for dB\u2208\u03c9 .  (16b) \n \nIII. DUAL PARAMETERIZATION ALGORITHM \nThe above problem can be solved using the dual parameterization algorithm [6]. \nWe first consider the Dorn\u2019s dual of problem (P) as \nProblem (D) \n( )\u039bx,min   ),( \u039bxL ,        (17a) \nsubject to  0\u039bAbxQ =++ \u2217 ,      (17b) \n   0\u039b \u2265 ,        (17c) \n 7\nwhere \n     \u222b+=\ndB\nT dL \u039bcxQx\u039bx )(\n2\n1),( \u03c9 ,     (18) \nA  is the operator from N \u2032\u211c  to ( )NdBC \u2032\u211c,  defined by )(\u03c9A  according to \n( ) xAxA )()( \u03c9\u03c9 =  for dB\u2208\u03c9 , where \u2217A  is the dual operator of A , N \u2032  is the \nlength of the vector x  and ( )NdBC \u2032\u211c,  is the Banach space of all continuous real \nfunctions on dB . \nAssume the Slater\u2019s qualification holds, that is, there exists N \u2032\u211c\u22080x  satisfying \n( ) 0xg <\u03c9,0  dB\u2208\u2200\u03c9 . Since \n(i)  J  and ( )\u03c9,xg  are convex in x , dB\u2208\u2200\u03c9 , \n(ii)  J  is differentiable on N \u2032\u211c , \n(iii) ),( \u03c9xg  is continuous in \u03c9 , N \u2032\u211c\u2208\u2200x , and continuously differentiable in \nx  on d\nN B\u00d7\u211c \u2032 , \nthe strong duality theorem holds. That is, if the minimum of the primal problem (P) is \nachieved by some N \u2032\u2217 \u211c\u2208x , then there exists a solution \u2217\u039b  of the dual problem (D), \nsuch that \n),(min)( \u2217\u2217 = \u039bxx\nx\nLJ ,      (19a) \nsubject to  ( ) 0\u039bcxA =\u2212\u222b \u2217\u2217\ndB\nd)()( \u03c9\u03c9 ,     (19b) \n   0\u039b \u2265\u2217 .         (19c) \nSince ( )\u03c9,xg  is continuously Fr\u00e9chet differentiable, the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker \n(KKT) conditions for problem (P) are also satisfied. That is, the minimum of problem \n(P) can be achieved at N \u2032\u2217 \u211c\u2208x  if and only if \u2217x  is feasible and there exists a \u2217\u039b  \nsuch that \n 8\n0\u039bAbxQ =++ \u2217\u2217\u2217 ,      (20a) \n( ) 0\u039bcxA =\u2212\u222b \u2217\u2217\ndB\nd )()()( \u03c9\u03c9\u03c9 ,     (20b) \n0\u039b \u2265\u2217 .        (20c) \nIn general, the multiplier \u2217\u039b  satisfying the KKT conditions is not unique. \nHowever, as we assume that the Slater constraint qualification is satisfied, and the \noptimal solution of the primal problem (P) is achieved at N \u2032\u2217 \u211c\u2208x . So the set of \nmultipliers satisfying the KKT conditions of problem (P) will necessarily include a \nmeasure with finite support at no more than N \u2032  points unless it is empty. This can be \nproved by the Carath\u00e9odory\u2019s theorem. Hence, there exists a solution pair ),( \u2217\u2217 \u039bx  \nof the dual problem (D) where the measure \u2217\u039b  has a finite support of no more than \nN \u2032  points. \nThe dual semi-infinite problem (D) can be reduced to the finite dimensional \noptimization problem (PD), called the parameterized dual of problem (P), as the \nfollowing: \nProblem (PD) \n),,(min\n),,(\n\u03bbtx\n\u03bbtx k\nL ,       (21a) \nsubject to  0\u03bb \u2265i ,  Ni \u2032= ,,2,1 L ,     (21b) \ndi B\u2208\u03c9 ,  Nki \u2032\u2264= ,,2,1 L ,    (21c) \nwhere the integer k  is the parameterization number, [ ]Tk\u03c9\u03c9\u03c9 ,,, 21 L=t  and \n[ ]k\u03bb\u03bb\u03bb\u03bb ,,, 21 L= , in which [ ] mTmiiii \u211c\u2208= ,2,1, ,,, \u03bb\u03bb\u03bb L\u03bb  and m  is the \nnumber of rows in matrix A .

(22) \n 9\nAccording to the dual parameterization theory, once a solution ( )\u2217\u2217\u2217 \u03bbtx ,,  is \nobtained from solving the problem (PD), the optimal solution of the primal problem \n(P) will also be \u2217x . To state the algorithm for solving the problem (P), denote the \nproblem obtained from problem (PD) by fixing t  as problem (PD(t)). It can be \nshown easily that problem (PD(t)) is the dual problem of the following problem (P(t)) \nfor fixed di B\u2208\u03c9 , ki ,,2,1 L= . \nProblem (P(t)) \nx\nmin   ( ) pJ TT ++= xbxQxx\n2\n1 ,     (23a) \nsubject to   ( ) 0xg \u2264i\u03c9, ,  for ki ,,2,1 L= .    (23b) \nHence, we have the following theorem: \nTheorem 1 \nConsider problems (P), (P(t)) and (PD). The following statements hold: \n(i) Let x  be an optimum solution of problem (P(t)). If x  satisfies the infinite \nconstraint (16b), then x  is the optimal solution of the primal problem (P). \n(ii) Let kv  be the optimal value of problem (PD) with parameterization number \nk , then sequence { }kv  is decreasing, and there exists \u2217k  such that \nkk vv =\u2217 , for all \u2217\u2265 kk . Furthermore, if 1\u2265\u2217k , then \u2217\u2217 >\u2212 kk vv 1 . \n(iii) The \u2217k  in (ii) is the minimum integer such that for \u2217\u2265 kk , a global solution \nof the finite problem (PD) provides the solution for the primal problem (P) in \nthe sense that if ),,( \u2217\u2217\u2217 \u03bbtx  is a global optimizer of problem (PD), then \u2217x  \nis the global optimizer of the primal problem (P). \n(iv) If \u2217<\u2264 kk0 , then 1+> kk vv . \nThe proof of Theorem 1 can be found in [6]. The number \u2217k  in Theorem 1 is called \n 10\nthe minimum parameterization number.

COMPUTER NUMERICAL SIMULATION RESULTS \nTo demonstrate the applicability of our proposed algorithm, a full band high \norder discrete-time differentiator is preferred. However, the magnitude response of the \ndiscrete-time differentiator would rise very fast if its order is high. Hence, it requires \nmany filter coefficients for the implementation. To tradeoff between these two factors, \na full band fifth order discrete-time differentiator is illustrated in this paper. That is, \n( ) 5\u03c9\u03c9 =D  dB\u2208\u2200\u03c9 . To design a full band fifth order discrete-time differentiator, \nsmall ripple magnitude and small transition bandwidth of the differentiator are usually \npreferred. However, it requires many filter coefficients for the implementation. To \ntradeoff among these factors, 32=N , 50064.0 \u03c0\u03b4 \u00d7=  and \u03c006.0=d  are chosen \nas the specifications. To demonstrate the performance of the full band fifth order \ndifferentiator, the effect of the weighted function should be removed and a uniform \nweighted function is employed, that is 1)( =\u03c9W  dB\u2208\u2200\u03c9 . In our proposed dual \nparameterization algorithm, a small value of \u03b5  is usually preferred. However, too \nsmall value of \u03b5  would increase the number of iterations and so the computational \ncomplexity is increased. To tradeoff between these two factors, 6101 \u2212\u00d7=\u03b5  is chosen. \nA large number of discrete frequencies in the index sets are usually preferred. \nHowever, too many discrete frequencies would increase the computational complexity. \nSince the number of extrema of the magnitude response of the full band fifth order \ndifferentiator designed via the Remez algorithm is equal to 2+N , the number of \ndiscrete frequencies in the first index set is 2+N . For the simplicity, a uniform \n 12\nsampling scheme is employed. So the first index set is initialized as \n\u23ad\u23ac\n\u23ab\n\u23a9\u23a8\n\u23a7 +=\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\n+\n\u2212+\u2212==\u03a9 1,,1,0for  \n1\n2\n2\n:1 NkN\ndkdkk L\n\u03c0\u03c0\u03c9\u03c9 . The other index sets are \nconstructed based on the previous index set by adding all violated index points of a \nrefined set of grid points to the previous index set while dropping all unnecessary \npoints from 1\u2212\u03a9i  for 1>i . \nOur computer numerical simulation results are compared to that designed based \non the eigen approach [2], the Remez approach [3] and the semi-definite \nprogramming approach [4]. These approaches are compared because these approaches \nare the most common approaches for the design of full band high order differentiators. \nThe magnitude response of the full band fifth order differentiators designed via \nvarious approaches are shown in Figure 1, while the corresponding weighted error \nfunctions are shown in Figure 2. We can see from Figure 2 that the maximum ripple \nmagnitude of the full band fifth order differentiator designed via the eigen approach is \nvery large that it fails to satisfy the specification. Although the full band fifth order \ndifferentiator designed via the Remez approach achieves the smallest ripple \nmagnitude among these approaches, the total weighted square error is the largest \namong these approaches. The full band fifth order differentiator designed via the \nsemi-definite programming approach also fails the specification because the number \nof discrete frequencies is not large enough. On the other hand, the full band fifth order \ndifferentiator designed via the peak constraint least square approach satisfies the \nrequired specification and minimizes the total weighted square error. \nActually it is difficult to have a fair comparison on the computational \ncomplexity of our proposed method to other existing methods because almost none of \nthem solve the design problem via the semi-infinite programming approach with the \nguarantee of the convergence of the algorithms. In our proposed method, it is found \n 13\nthat the algorithm terminated after three iterations, and the number of discrete \nfrequencies in the last index set is 1345. If the design problem is formulated via the \nsemi-definite programming approach with the same number of discrete frequencies, it \nis shown in Figure 2 that the solution obtained does not satisfy the specification. \nHence, more discrete frequencies are required for the semi-definite programming \napproach. It implies that the computational complexity of the semi-definite \nprogramming approach is much higher than our proposed algorithm [4]. \n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\nAngular frequency \u03c9  (rad\/s)\n|H\n0(\n\u03c9)\n|\nEigen approach\nRemez approach\nSemi-definite approach\nOur proposed approach\n \nFigure 1.

CONCLUSION \nThe main contribution of this paper is to formulate the optimum discrete-time \ndifferentiator design problem as a peak constrained least square optimization problem. \nActually, the problem formulation can also be applied to non-full band arbitrary order \ndiscrete-time differentiator design problems. The formulated problem is a \nsemi-infinite programming problem and our proposed dual parameterization \nalgorithm is employed for solving the problem. The main advantages of our proposed \nalgorithm are i) the guarantee of the solutions converging to the optimum one that \nsatisfies the continuous constraints if the solution exists; and ii) low computational \ncomplexity because the semi-infinite programming problem is transformed to a finite \ndimensional optimization problem and just a few active points are sufficient to give \nenough information for searching the optimal solution. \n \n 15\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \nThe work obtained in this paper was supported by a research grant (project \nnumber G-YD26) from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, the Centre for \nMultimedia Signal Processing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, the CRGC \ngrant (project number PolyU 5105\\01E) from the Research Grants Council of Hong \nKong, as well as a research grant from Australian Research Council. \n \nREFERENCES \n[1] San L.
