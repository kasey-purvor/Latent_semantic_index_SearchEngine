Perhaps reflecting the uncertain tenor of world politics, \nso International Relations (IR) theory too is undergoing a period of flux. The root and branch \nassault on mainstream approaches ushered in by the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end \nof the bipolar era has shown few signs of abating in recent years. Rather, the fracture between \nrationalism and reflectivism, allied to splinters within these broad camps, has produced a \nscene of dizzying complexity. In place of the pedestrian neorealist and institutionalist inter-\nparadigm debate has emerged a display of ebullient plumage: neo-classical (Rose 1998), \noffensive (Mearsheimer 2003; Elman 2004) and defensive (Van Evera 1999) realism,1 a \nrekindled liberalism (Moravcsik 1997; Legro and Moravcsik 1999),2 various forms of \nconstructivism (Onuf 1989, 1998; Adler 1997; Ruggie 1998; Wendt 1999),3 normative theory \n(pace Hoffman 1981; Risse, Ropp and Sikkink 1999; Brown 2002), a m\u00e9lange of post-\npositivist approaches,4 and a reconvened English School (Dunne 1998; Buzan 2004),5 all \n                                                 \n* Earlier versions of this article were presented at the 2003 annual conference of the British \nInternational Studies Association in Birmingham, and at the European Consortium for \nPolitical Research conference at the Hague in September 2004. My thanks to fellow panel \nmembers and participants at these events, and also to Justin Rosenberg, John Hobson, Bryan \nMabee, Kimberly Hutchings, Robert Falkner, Jennifer Sterling-Folker, Felix Berenskoetter, \nRichard Little, and Fred Halliday for valuable comments on earlier drafts. I gratefully \nacknowledge the financial support offered by the UK\u2019s Economic and Social Research \nCouncil in providing funding which supported research carried out for this article. \n1 The terms \u2018offensive\u2019 and \u2018defensive\u2019 realism were introduced into IR by Snyder (1991). \n2 Perhaps the main empirical focus of contemporary liberal theory is the democratic peace. \nOn this, see Doyle (1983a and 1983b), Russett (1993), and the various contributions to \nBrown, Lynn-Jones and Miller (1996). \n3 On constructivism\u2019s fissures, see Kratochwil (2000). \n4 Post-positivism is a somewhat crude catch-all term intended to capture the array of theorists \nwho reject the mechanistic, rationalist project associated with positivist IR. The best \nintroduction to these diverse standpoints is Smith, Booth and Zalewski (1996).   \n5 Dunne and Buzan build on canonical English School texts by Butterfield and Wight (1966), \nBull (1977), Wight (1991), and Watson (1992).  \n3 \ncompeting with neorealism (Waltz 1979, 1993, 1996, 2000; Layne 1993; Walt 1987, 2002)6 \nand institutional theory (Keohane 1984; Martin 1992; Keohane and Martin 1995, 2003)7 on \nthe basis of ontological foundations, epistemological logics, and empirical substance.  \n One of the most striking dimensions of this blossoming of a thousand theoretical \napproaches has been the sociological turn in IR. Previously rather neglected by IR scholars, at \nleast compared to the influence of economics, political science and political theory, sociology \nhas become increasingly influential over the past decade or so. Several approaches, most \nnotable amongst them constructivism, have discovered (or rediscovered) the work of figures \nas diverse as Anthony Giddens, J\u00fcrgen Habermas and Erving Goffman, not to mention \nDurkheim, Marx, Gramsci, and Weber. This has served to outline the importance of socially \nconstructed norms, social processes of identity formation, culture and ideology, inter-\nsubjective understandings, and social structures to the study and practice of world politics.  \n Given this vogue for sociology in IR, it is somewhat surprising that one of sociology\u2019s \nprincipal sub-disciplines \u2013 historical sociology \u2013 has received relatively little attention from \nthe IR corpus. This omission is even more striking given that the central concern of historical \nsociology \u2013 processes of large-scale change \u2013 seems particularly well suited to examining the \ncomplexities of contemporary world politics. In fact, the uncertain tenor of contemporary \ninternational affairs seems to have provoked three principle strategies within the IR scholarly \ncommunity: a continued focus on parsimony that is necessarily and self-consciously partial; a \nretreat to theoretical bunkers in order to defend a particular set of precepts, concepts and \nmethods; and a renewed attention to micro-narratives that provide ample details about the \nrichness of thick historical experience, but little insight into the broader patterns, trends and \ntrajectories that make up contemporary world politics. The main aim of this article is to \n                                                 \n6 In this article, neorealism is used synonymously with structural realism. \n7 On the benefits of interdependence often associated with institutional theory, see Keohane \nand Nye (2001). \n4 \nillustrate how a fourth option, that opened up by historical sociology, can contribute to a \nwider discussion about the role, content and form of IR theory. Historical sociology, as I \nexplore in this article, aims to work alongside, and perhaps even to underpin, a range of IR \nparadigms. It is, I argue, through just such an approach that the major trends, causal patterns \nand analytical properties of contemporary world politics can be usefully unpacked, surveyed \nand explained.  \n My argument proceeds in four parts. The first section explores the sociological micro-\nfoundations of contemporary IR theory. There will be little here that is of surprise to those \nwho dine out on the intricacies of this subject. But the discussion provides the necessary basis \nfor a second section in which the equally flawed macrofoundations of the discipline are \nexamined. In both sections, insights drawn from historical sociology, and in particular from \nhistorical institutionalism, are used to broaden existing concepts and to build bridges between \nthe apparently obdurate spheres of rational action and social structure. The third section \nexamines the capacity of institutions to act as a conduit between structure and agency, in turn \nproviding a viable means of generating ideal-types that can usefully probe the principal \npatterns of world politics. The final section highlights the main benefits of historical \nsociology for International Relations.  \n \n \nMicro-foundations  \n \nThe foundations of any approach that looks to move beyond the stale yet divisive \ndichotomies of contemporary IR theory must start with the micro-foundations of social \naction: the assumption of instrumental rationality itself. Neorealism, institutional theory and \n5 \nliberalism share a common acceptance of the utilitarian underpinnings of social action.8 For \nthese schools of thought, actors (primarily states, but on occasion individuals, transnational \nfirms, domestic bureaucracies, terrorist groups, and non-governmental organizations) act in \npursuit of their narrowly defined self-interest. In conditions of anarchy, this self-interest is \nprimarily characterized as survival. Preferences, whether endogenously or exogenously \nderived, are givens or assumptions that generate consistent outcomes.9 The three approaches \ndiffer about the consequences of these impulses: for neorealists, international politics \nrepresents a prisoners dilemma that obviates cooperation except in rare situations of necessity \n(such as the formation of alliances against a common threat); for institutionalists, cooperation \nis sustained through iterated tit-for-tat mechanisms in which the threat of retaliation alongside \nthe facilitation of smoother information flows and monitoring mechanisms deters cheating \n(an example could be the abandonment by Libya of its nuclear program following the \ninvasion of Iraq in 2004); for liberals, preferences are less fixed, subject as they are to the \nmachinations of Innenpolitik (state-society relations, party politics, public opinion and the \nlike) as well as transnational forces. Yet nevertheless, it is argued, even preferences derived \nfrom the \u2018bottom-up\u2019 constitute relatively firm building blocks for the development of \nparsimonious theory. \n                                                 \n8 As Jeffrey Legro and Andrew Moravcsik (1999) put it, the realist focus on resources, the \nliberal focus on preferences, and the institutional focus on information make up the three \nleading elements in the rationalist research programme. However, Legro and Moravcsik also \nwant to include constructivist theory that they approve of. Hence, Wendt, Katzenstein and \nothers are invited, by virtue of their insights into beliefs (ideology), to join a \u2018meta-paradigm\u2019 \nthat acts as an overarching umbrella within which mainstream approaches to the subject can \noperate. An analogous argument is made by Lebow (2004). \n9 The distinction between those who see preferences as rooted in second image factors and \nthose who see preferences as determined either by primal drives or by the structure of the \ninternational system is regarded, at least by Andrew Moravcsik (1997), as the fundamental \nfault-line between neorealism and institutional theory on the one hand, and liberalism on the \nother. In response, Robert Keohane and Lisa Martin (1995, 2003) accept that preferences may \nvary according to group conflicts within the state. However, both also argue that the primacy \nof neorealist and institutionalist research stems from their ability to assume consistent \npreferences, and to explain state strategies on that basis.   \n6 \n The root of the difficulties that underpin these positions is the matching of rationality \nwith instrumentality. There may well be instances where expected utility analysis is useful, \nbut as a general theory it is overly rigid: it cannot explain behavior that does not appear to be \nself-interested (such as why people vote in elections when the chance of affecting the \noutcome directly is minute), why people act out of a sense of duty rather than self-\npreservation (for example by fighting in wars), or why people behave irrationally (by \nsmoking, taking drugs or, perhaps, joining revolutionary movements).10 Assuming that \npreferences and interests are derived from primal drives, domestically determined tastes or \nthe necessities of an unyielding structure may generate consistent findings, but these findings \ndistort rather than reflect reality. For example, in political life, it is not always possible to \ndiscern what instrumental utility is. As John Elster (1989) points out, policy makers deal with \ndegrees of probability rather than matters of objective or externally derived fact \u2013 they may \nhave too much information or too little, may be presented with wrong evidence, or may make \nincorrect decisions even when confronted with sufficient evidence. Given a lack of \nclairvoyance, in circumstances of multiple equilibria there is little way of knowing in advance \nthe optimal path to take. A doctor waiting to perform an emergency operation is acutely \naware that the medical team runs the risk of making the patient\u2019s condition irreversible if they \nwait too long in trying to gather information, yet doctors could also jeopardize the success of \nthe operation by beginning the procedure before they have sufficient knowledge of the \n                                                 \n10 On the extent to which IR theories can be said to embrace rationality, see Kahler (1998) \nand, in particular, Mercer (2005a), who makes the point that rationality is not somehow \nremoved from psychological processes, but rather dependent on psychological states such as \nemotions. As he puts it (2005a:94), \u2018emotion precedes choice (by ranking one\u2019s preferences), \nemotion influences choice (because it directs one\u2019s attention and is the source of action), and \nemotion follows choice (which determines how one feels about one\u2019s choice and influences \none\u2019s preferences)\u2019. Hence, psychology should be seen less as a means of explaining non-\nrational mistakes, but more as something that is deeply woven into the fabric of rationality \nitself. By draining psychology from rationality, Mercer argues, rational choice approaches \ncollapse into normative ceteris paribus statements which rely, unwittingly and without \nacknowledgement, on what he calls \u2018folk psychology\u2019.  \n7 \npatient\u2019s previous medical history and condition. There is no way of functionally deriving in \nadvance the desired outcome, individual or collective, from the myriad of options available to \nrational actors. Given this, rationality cannot hope to infer truth. Rather, as Elster puts it, the \nbalance between short-term and long-term outcomes, the role of belief, issues of will, and the \nsocial mechanisms that constrain instrumental action \u2013 norms, laws, conventions, and the like \n\u2013 indicate that instrumentality has limits, boundaries that limit its effectiveness as an \noverarching theory of social action.  \n The boundaries of instrumental rational choice are further narrowed by the law of \n\u2018unintended consequences\u2019 (Merton 1996, pace John Locke). Economists have long been \naware that firms weather recessions by lowering wages; they are also aware that the \nunintended consequence of this rational action is that employees have less purchasing power, \nwhich as a result tends to deepen the recession. Political decisions such as the development of \nwelfare systems have generated secondary problems in the emergence of poverty traps and \nwelfare dependency.11 In these instances, apparently rational instrumental action produces \nsuboptimal or even counterproductive outcomes. Instrumental individual choice, such as \nhaving more children in order to provide for a family in old age, delivers collective \ncounterfinality (overpopulation makes all worse off) if large numbers of families decide on \nthe same strategy.12 The secondary impact of instrumental action may be positive or negative; \nthe only certainty is that unintended consequences (externalities) ensue. Just as prescription \ndrugs contain side-effects, solving one problem while causing another, so it is with the social \nworld. Rationality is indeterminate in terms of both design and outcome.  \n                                                 \n11 Nor is the natural world immune from these processes. As Stephen Jay Gould (1985) notes, \navian limbs developed to keep birds warm, only later becoming used as a means to develop \nwings and fly. \n12 Mancur Olsen\u2019s (1965) conception of the \u2018collective action problem\u2019 is no less difficult an \nissue today than when Olsen introduced it into social science forty years ago.  \n8 \nA third set of problems arises from issues of cognition. Over the last thirty years or so, \nRobert Jervis (1976, 1997, 1998; Jervis and Balzacq 2004) has consistently illustrated the \nimportance of cognitive bias, motivated bias, and cognitive dissonance to foreign policy \nmaking. For Jervis, belief systems, often shorthanded as \u2018lessons from history\u2019 (such as the \nappeasement of Hitler at Munich, or the body-bag syndrome inherited from Vietnam), act as \nfilters through which policy makers make decisions. Frequently, Jervis writes, events sweep \naside previously held convictions. In this way, the German Socialist Party chose to support \nthe war effort in 1914, much to the disappointment of the party\u2019s more fervent members. \nConversely, policy makers often see what they want to see, ignoring alternative possibilities \nand manipulating information in order to fit pre-ordained images of how the world is rather \nthan rationally judging each decision solely on its merits.13 During the Cold War, \u2018threat \ninflation\u2019 by US foreign policy experts consistently overestimated the degree of the Soviet \nthreat. The result was a policy that was not rational in a narrow utilitarian sense but driven, to \na great extent, by the ideology of the hawks who advocated it (Mann 2004). Bob \nWoodward\u2019s (2004) study of the decision making process that led up to the war in Iraq shows \nthat many members of President Bush\u2019s inner circle interpreted the attacks of September 11th \nthrough the prism of their predisposition against Saddam Hussein. Sometimes the \u2018halo \neffect\u2019 that surrounds the actions of friendly states is matched by an equally strong bias \nagainst one\u2019s enemies, hence the repositories of \u2018resolve credit\u2019 (Snyder and Jervis 1993) that \nhelp to explain, for example, the very different reputations that the UK enjoys in the United \nStates and Europe.14 Because there is such a lack of clarity about the intentions of others in \nthe international realm, so policy makers frequently judge the actions of others incorrectly: \n                                                 \n13 On this, also see Freeden (2003). Ronald Inglehart (1990, 1997) has, over a voluminous \ncareer, demonstrated how people\u2019s underlying values are shaped by their material \ncircumstances early in life. While attitudes and opinions may change, underlying deeply-held \nimpulses remain largely stable. \n14 On the importance of reputation in world politics, see Mercer (1996). \n9 \nmisperception and misunderstanding are a commonplace of foreign policy making. Hence, \nHitler invaded Czechoslovakia on the perfectly rational basis that the British were fully aware \nof the extent of his territorial ambition yet, following Munich, lacking the stomach for a fight. \nIn fact, British foreign policy makers were stunned by the invasion and Hitler\u2019s actions \ninduced a radical change of policy, leading in turn to the advent of war (Jervis 1976).  \nThe rational choice schema that underpins much contemporary IR theory appears to \nnecessitate what Alexander Wendt (2001) describes as a \u2018rearview mirror\u2019 approach, looking \nbackwards at decisions in order to determine actors \u2018revealed preferences\u2019. Even then, \nrational choice is limited in its scope. As Wendt notes, rational choice envisages human \nbeings as slaves to reason, driven by internal mechanical drives about which people can do \nnothing. There may be a degree of consistency to the heuristics and \u2018evoked sets\u2019 that policy \nmakers work within: operational code analysis (Walker 2003), prospect theory (Farnham \n1994, 1997; Levy 1997; McDermott 1998, 2004b; Mercer 2005b) and other such approaches \n(Young and Shafer 1998, Goldgeier and Tetlock 2001, McDermott 2004a) provide useful \nstarting points for managing the complexity of decision making in international politics.15 \nBut the central problem surrounding the use of expected utility theory as a guiding principle \nof IR research revolves around the issues of which assumptions should be made in order to \nsimplify reality for the sake of theory. This should only secondarily be a competition about \ninternal elegance; much more important is the quality of research outputs. Yet the narrowness \n                                                 \n15 For example, prospect theory focuses on the ways in which decisions are framed either as \ngains or losses. If outcomes are framed as losses, perceptions of risk increase; if outcomes are \nframed as gains, perceptions of risk decline. On the whole people appear to be more \nconcerned about possible losses than with potential gains; and the reference points (frames) \nwhich they operate within has a critical effect on which actions they are willing to \ncountenance. As such, policy makers inhabiting a \u2018domain of loss\u2019 are more likely to take \nrisks than those operating in a \u2018domain of gain\u2019. Applications of prospect theory in IR is, as \nyet, relatively limited, at least outside foreign policy analysis. But research in economics has \nattempted to operationalize the theory by examining the failure of consumers to act \ninstrumentally because of their fear of \u2018losing out\u2019, for example by paying too much for a \nparticular service. Daniel McFadden, President of the American Economic Association, calls \nthis process \u2018agoraphobia\u2019 \u2013 fear of the marketplace. \n10 \nof rational, subjective instrumentality privileges presentism in a way that detracts from this \ngoal. Just as the Cold War led to a negative reinterpretation within the Western Alliance of \nthe Soviet role during World War Two, so the 9\/11 Commission Report (2004) aptly displays \nhow difficult it was for professionals, from air traffic controllers to White House staffers, to \ncountenance the prospect of an attack that was so far removed from their frontal frames of \nreference. Policy makers and members of the public alike consistently gamble resources in \nschemes in which the likelihood of optimal outcomes is minimal \u2013 the \u2018sunk costs\u2019 that such \nventures consume skew the instrumental utility of particular decisions. As such, a focus on \nsubjective expected utility does little justice to the complexity of decision making in a rapidly \nchanging world; it is as if Occam\u2019s razor had become the Manichean foundation for the study \nof world politics.  \nRecognizing this, some sociologists have built on initial work carried out by Max \nWeber in order to broaden the concept of rationality. For Weber, rationality consisted of two \nideal-types: Zweckrationalit\u00e4t or technical, purposive, calculating needs-based rationality and \nWertrationalit\u00e4t, which was inspired by and directed to the realization of values or \u2018worth\u2019.  \nAs Weber (1978:280) put it, \u2018frequently, the \u201cworld images\u201d that have been created by \n\u201cideas\u201d have, like switchmen, determined the tracks along which action has been pushed by \nthe dynamics of interests\u2019. Weber\u2019s dual anchoring of rationality in both interests and norms \ninspired the work of Herbert Simon (1982, 1983), James March (1988; March and Simon \n1958) and others, who studied how decision-making processes in administrative \norganizations operated as both a logic of consequences and a logic of appropriateness.16 \nSimon and March found that the time and space that decision-makers could devote to a \n                                                 \n16 Contra Stephen Krasner, who claims that a foundational difference between international \nand domestic politics is that the former demands a logic of consequences, while the latter \naccommodates a logic of appropriateness. To put it another way, in the international realm, \nhomo economicus trumps homo sociologicus. Krasner (1999:51) sums up his position pithily, \n\u2018a bullet through the head has the same effect regardless of the cognitive perspectives of the \ntarget\u2019.  \n11 \nparticular issue was necessarily limited. In this way, rationality was \u2018bounded\u2019, partly due to \ndecision-makers\u2019 own cognitive capacities and beliefs about \u2018the right thing to do\u2019, partly \nbecause the information they received was \u2018imperfect\u2019. In \u2018multi-goal coalitions\u2019 like \norganizations and bureaucracies, choices were made and difficult decisions taken as much \nbecause of managers own normative frameworks and cognitive capabilities as it was because \nof their own perceived self-interest. Decision making in these organizations featured a \nstriking level of ambiguity. For March et al., it was more accurate to see individuals as \nbounded \u2018satisficers\u2019 rather than as isolated egoists.  \nAn example helps to illustrate this point further. On 6 June 1944, allied forces began \nan attack on German-occupied France: Operation Overlord or D-Day. Looking back at D-\nDay, 60 years or so after the invasion, it is difficult to recall or recapture the sense of \nuncertainty that surrounded it. Yet recent research indicates that those closest to the invasion \nwere far from certain about its outcome, as indicated by a note prepared by the Supreme \nCommander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces, General Dwight D. Eisenhower (in Van der \nVat 2003:46), in the eventuality of a failed attack: \n \nOur landings in the Cherbourg-Havre area have failed to gain a satisfactory foothold \nand I have withdrawn the troops. My decision to attack at this time and place was \nbased upon the best information available. The troops, the air force and the navy did \nall that bravery and devotion to duty could do. If any blame or fault is attached to the \nattempt, it is mine alone. \n \nEisenhower\u2019s note reveals many of the difficulties associated with utilitarian schema. First, \ndespite an extensive, meticulous research exercise, allied planners were still dealing with \nimperfect information. They were unable to gauge the full strength of the Germans, the role \nwhich would be played (or not) by the Luftwaffe, and they could not fully unravel German \ncommunication messages. Second, there were contextual forces and hidden variables that it \nwas impossible to control fully: the weather, which delayed the invasion for several days, the \n12 \nexact depth of the ocean at their chosen landing points, the number of troops who became \nseasick and so on. Third, Eisenhower\u2019s note invokes a sense of the normative issues \u2013 hope, \nduty, responsibility \u2013 without which human history would have no meaning. Collectively \nheld norms define what is appropriate conduct in particular social settings. People\u2019s beliefs \nand views of the world influence both what their interests are and what they perceive them to \nbe. These qualities are fundamental to social life: they are at the root of human experience yet \nthey cannot be predicted in advance. Willpower and collective spirit are the reason why \napparently weaker sports teams overcome stronger opponents, and they are also the means by \nwhich small, committed bands of revolutionaries can defeat far better resourced, and better \narmed, adversaries. Functional, utilitarian approaches fail to understand or explain how social \naction takes place on the ground, and how the various units and actors of world politics play a \nformative role in the creation of their conditions and in processes of social change.  \nWithout an adequate understanding of norms, values and cognition, in addition to \nbuilding in a more nuanced analysis of risk, uncertainty and psychological processes such as \nframing and coding, the view of rationality offered by much mainstream IR theory appears \nmore like a belief system relying on the false consciousness of actors who do not know why \nthey are acting in a certain way rather than any kind of universally applicable social theory \n(Boudon 1998). This picture of parsimonious theory as dependent in the first instance on \naccepting a thick form of rational choice results in a radically stilted picture of international \naffairs. As John Elster (1989:54) writes, \u2018sometimes the world is messy, and the most \nparsimonious explanation is wrong\u2019. The first dimension of a (historical) sociological turn in \nIR is to help shift researchers away from the use, and abuse, which follow from the \nwidespread adoption of such a restricted view of rationality. \n  \n \n13 \nMacro-foundations \n \nUnderstanding the intricacies that constitute the micro-processes of world politics does not \nmean ignoring the more general trajectories that unite states in the modern era, whether this \nbe the triviality of national emblems or the more serious business of shared economies, \npeoples and history. In the contemporary world, the most powerful of these generic \ntendencies is modernity itself: the range of political, economic and social processes which \nhave served to recast domestic and international orders over the last four or five hundred \nyears. The resulting constellations \u2013 the states-system, capitalism, patriarchy and the like \u2013 \nare structures that contain a global reach. In many ways, therefore, global history over the last \nhalf-millennium is a shared story: struggles for and against colonialism, the extension of trade \naround the world and technological advances have, with varying degrees of coercion, brought \nthe world within some kind of public commons. In this sense, modernity is, as Ernest Gellner \n(1983) puts it, a \u2018tidal wave\u2019 of homogenizing pressures. But the tsunami has not been \nequally or evenly felt: the commodification of labor, urbanization, bureaucratization, gender \nequality, universal suffrage and the like may have penetrated even the most inhospitable of \nenvironments, but they have not done so in a uniform manner. The systemic dislocations \nwrought by modernity have provoked a multiplicity of responses: global capitalism and \nautarky, market-democracy and authoritarianism, fundamentalism and secularism. At its \nheart, modernity appears to be an inherently contradictory process, one marked by greater \naffluence but also rising inequality; global forms of governance alongside a drive to local \nautonomy (Clark 1997). \n14 \n This terrain \u2013 the transformation of social, economic and political orders under \nmodernity \u2013 is the principle turf occupied by historical sociology.17 Although there was, and \nthere remains, much variation within historical sociology, it is possible to delineate three \nmain assumptions that historical sociologists share. First, there is an appreciation that any \nunderstanding of contemporary social relations can only be formed by knowledge of the \nlong-term and short-term antecedents which generate them. This means accepting that \ncontemporary conditions are inherited from the past, constraining and enabling the actions of \npeople in the present day. At the heart of historical sociology, therefore, is recognition of the \nimportance of \u2018path dependency\u2019 \u2013 the idea that there is a causal dependence from \ncontemporary events and processes to prior occurrences.18 Such an understanding runs \ncounter to the tendencies of much IR theory to truncate the study of world politics by reifying \nsocial processes and social facts \u2013 states, the market, sovereignty \u2013 as timeless analytical (and \nultimately as ontological) entities. The 200 or so states that make up contemporary world \npolitics are forced into the same timeless conceptual straightjacket as the 600,000 or so \npolitical communities that existed 3000 years ago, ignoring the historical evolution from a \nsparse system of states, to a society of states, and perhaps, to a world society (Wendt 2003, \nBuzan 2004). This has been neither a linear nor a structurally determined path. Rather, it has \n                                                 \n17 A selective list of post-war historical sociology would include Mills (1958), Smelser \n(1958), Bloch (1961), Eisenstadt (1963), James (1963), Lipset (1963), Moore (1966), Aron \n(1968), Braudel (1972), Anderson (1974a and 1974b), Bendix (1978), Stinchcombe (1978), \nCollins (1979), Skocpol (1979, 1992), Calhoun (1982), Wallerstein (1983), Giddens (1984), \nHall (1985), Mann (1986, 1993, 2004), Gellner (1988), Tilly (1988, 1999, 2003), Sayer \n(1991), Collier and Collier (1991), Spruyt (1994), Rosenberg (1994), Ertman (1997), Frank \n(1998), Collier (1999), Halliday (1999), Buzan and Little (2000), Parsa (2000), Shaw (2000), \nMahoney (2001), Teschke (2003), Hobson (2004), Thelen (2004), Pierson (2004), and \nLawson (2005). Useful collections of historical sociology can be found in Skocpol (1984), \nEvans, Reuschmeyer, and Skocpol (1985), McDonald (1996), Delanty and Isin (2003), \nMahoney and Reuschmeyer (2003), Gould (2005), and Adams, Clemens, and Orloff (2005). \n18 Although it is important to note that this does not mean a necessary acceptance of \nteleology, linearity and monocausality. On this point, see Sewell (1996). On path \ndependency, see Abbott (1990, 2001), Aminzade (1992), Arthur (1994), Ertman (1997), Isaac \n(1997), Goldstone (1998), Mahoney (2000), Katznelson (2003), Pierson (2004), and Sewell \n(2005). \n15 \nbeen a story of conflict and struggle as individuals, groups, political communities, religions, \nfirms, nations, and empires have interacted within rapidly shifting contexts in the \nconstruction of contemporary world politics.19  \n Such a move runs counter to the ahistorical tendencies of much IR theory \u2013 the \nmining of the past in order to confirm suppositions about the present, the smoothing out of \ndifferences, varieties and processes of change in the interests of methodological purity and \ntheoretical rigidity, and the bracketing off of history behind an eternal \u2018illusory present\u2019 \n(Hobson 2006). Thus, the contest between Athens and Sparta is transplanted to the Cold War \nin order to elucidate the stand-off between the United States and the Soviet Union; all wars, \nwhether they be guerrilla insurgencies or total conflicts, are fundamentally explicable by the \nbasic facts of international anarchy and instrumental action; and all political units \u2013 city-\nstates, nomadic tribes, empires, nation-states and transnational alliances \u2013 are functionally \nundifferentiated. As a consequence of this, much IR theory exists outside history (Rosenberg \n1994b), operating from a static picture of world politics which irons out differences between \npolitical units, omits global structural forces beyond anarchy and polarity, and reduces \nagency to the unit-level musings of statesmen, financiers and generals. Historical sociology, \nlike classical social theory more generally, is rooted in the substantive application of social \nrelations as they are constituted in time and place, followed by the examination of how far \nthese social processes and social facts are generalisable across both time and space. And this \nfocus stands in stark contrast to the \u2018synchronic mystique\u2019 (Hobson 2002) within with which \nmuch IR theory labors, in which the past, the present and the future are presented as one and \nthe same story \u2013 a giant optical illusion which distorts rather than captures the richness of \nhistory\u2019s multiple landscapes. \n                                                 \n19 The reduction of international politics behind reified abstractions also generates a \nEurocentrism which does a disservice to the myriad ways in which the non-western world has \nbeen at the leading-edge of global political, economic and cultural developments. On this, see \nAmin (1988), Frank and Gills (1996), Frank (1998), and Hobson (2004). \n16 \n Second, historical sociologists agree on the importance of accounting for changing \ntemporal context. For example, modern forms of empire, revolution and war diverge \nfundamentally from cases drawn from previous epochs precisely because the context for \naction \u2013 domestic and international \u2013 as well as the structures and agents bound up with these \nprocesses of change are substantively different. The result is what we might call \u2018research \nwith adjectives\u2019 (Collier and Levitsky 1997), or more specifically, middle-range theory: the \nlinking of general abstractions (such as society, state or empire) with additional explanatory \nsignifiers (industrial vs. post-industrial society; market state vs. sovereign state; formal vs. \ninformal empire), in order to provide a more nuanced understanding of the relationship \nbetween conceptual abstractions and empirical research. Examples include exploration of \nhow the general structural condition of the Cold War played out in regional contexts,20 and at \nhow time and space differentiation impacts on general abstractions such as empire (Lieven \n2001; Mann 2003) and revolution (Halliday 1999; Lawson 2005).21 \n The Italian political scientist Giovanni Sartori (1970) makes this point well. For \nSartori, at the extreme edge of abstraction lies the possibility of \u2018concept stretching\u2019 or \n\u2018straining\u2019 towards vague, amorphous crystallizations, pseudo-universals without either \nprecision or purchase. Sartori proposed that social science works within a ladder of \nabstraction ranging from general abstractions (genus) to mid-level taxonomies (class) to \nempirical analysis (species). In this way, Sartori argued, social scientists are best served by \nstarting with medium-level abstractions or hypothesis, and working up and down the ladder \nof abstraction, testing whether their hunches fit both with more general concepts, and with the \navailable empirical material. For Sartori, this process of \u2018conceptual travelling\u2019 generates \n                                                 \n20 For an application of this type of research to the Middle East, see Halliday (2005). \n21 The term \u2018theories of the middle-range\u2019 comes from Robert Merton (1996). It is important \nto note that not all historical sociology adopts this approach. Indeed, there is a major strand of \nhistorical sociology, with its roots in Marxism, which is holist, structuralist and determinist. \nIn Lawson (2006), I provide a mapping exercise which differentiates between types of \nhistorical sociology. \n17 \n\u2018fact-storing containers\u2019 (empirical universals) which are geared at unravelling the interplay \nbetween homogeneity and heterogeneity, and which combine explanatory purchase with a \nhigh level of empirical content. Subsequently renamed by David Collier and James Mahon \n(1993) as a \u2018ladder of generality\u2019, Sartori\u2019s method allows concepts, categories and causal \nregularities to be rigorously assessed over time and space, while also allowing for the \ngeneration of workable, theoretically compelling taxonomies, and classificatory schemas \nwhich can differentiate between normal abnormality and abnormal normality.22   \n Third, historical sociologists argue that empirically sound, comparative work can \ndirect disciplines away from static, snap-shot approaches to a more vibrant account that can \nmake sense of the dynamism of social action and social change. Rather than searching for a \nkind of functional homology between social and historical processes, history itself becomes \nthe tool kit or route map that, as Dennis Smith (1991:184) puts it, \u2018can help us distinguish \nbetween open doors and brick walls\u2019. Over the last two centuries, several waves of historical \nsociologists have studied the interaction between large-scale structural processes, and the \naction of individuals, groups and states that has both produced and reproduced them.23 These \nscholars have found enduring patterns to world politics, but have also discovered that even \nthe most powerful social structures are historically particular, created by the actions of people \n                                                 \n22 Sartori\u2019s work echoes the clarion call issued by the American sociologist C. Wright Mills \n(1958), who long called for a social scientific enterprise which eschewed both grand theory \n(abstraction without application) and abstracted empiricism (behaviouralist quantifications of \nhuman action). For more on how Sartori and Mills contribute to the \u2018historical sociological \nimagination\u2019, see Lawson (2006). \n23 This is not to say that all historical sociologists have adopted this line. Much \u2018second wave\u2019 \nhistorical sociology exhibited a tendency to focus on the structural dimensions of social \nchange \u2013 relative geopolitical position, degrees of modernization, class relations and so on \u2013 \nto the detriment of agency, both domestic and international. See, for example, Moore (1967), \nSkocpol (1979), and Goldstone (1991). Others have attempted to link rational choice \nexplicitly to historical sociology, although not without attracting criticism. On this, see \nHechter (1992), Hechter and Kiser (1998), Somers (1998) and the various contributions to \nGould  (2005). However, for the most part, historical sociologists have tended to adopt a form \nof relationism (Emirbayer 1997). On the various \u2018waves\u2019 of scholarship within historical \nsociology, see Smith (1991), Lawson (2005), and Evans, Clemens, and Orloff (2005).  \n18 \nin a particular time and space: empires rise and fall; world religions are forced to reform their \npractices or face losing moral authority; dictators delegate and slaves rebel. There are \nnumerous homogenizing features that effect the international realm ranging from the spread \nof global capitalism, religions, ideologies and languages to the adoption of national flags, \nanthems, airlines, football teams and Olympic squads, but these processes are neither \nunalterable nor are they uncontestable. Human beings are not puppets whose movements are \ncontrolled by unseen forces nor are people automatons, doomed to respond to stimuli in \nprescribed ways. If this was the case, history would offer no surprises, no tale of David \ndefeating Goliath, no example of revolutionary change being made in unlikely circumstances. \nYet, to take on this latter example, revolutions are processes in which people actively create \nand respond to changing contexts, constructing novel social orders that are both constrained \nand enabled by social structures inherited from the past. No structure, however immutable it \nseems, lasts forever.  \n The dynamism of this picture, a story of the making of the modern world rooted in the \nco-constitutive role played by material and ideational factors, by economic, social and \npolitical processes, and by international and domestic forces, is one that is only latently \nrecognized within the IR lexicon. Indeed, the contrast with structural theories of International \nRelations, in particular neorealism, could scarcely be more pronounced. At its core, \nneorealism is static, denying changes to the deep structure of the international system over \ntime and place. For structural realists, only third image explanations carry with them the \nprospect of genuine theory. Even a minimal interpretation of the theory sees the third level of \nanalysis as the basic starting point for theorizing about world politics. Without accepting the \nexplanatory implications of the anarchical international system, structural realists argue, one \ncannot understand the mechanism of balancing, nor the eternal security dilemma (Jervis \n1978) that states labor within. The unyielding fact of anarchy breeds a world of depressing \n19 \nconsistency: of timeless state conflict as a necessary impulse of the self-help system, of \nstatesmen foolishly playing dice with the loaded mechanisms of international structure,24 of \ndivision within the world based only on relative material (for which the word power is often \nmisleadingly substituted) capabilities.25 This may be a theory, but it is a theory without a \nnuanced understanding of structure or world history. \n Neorealists assert that there is a dual structure to international politics: a primary level \nof (constant) anarchy that compels processes of socialization, emulation and competition, and \na secondary (variable) sphere of polarity, which effects the quality of balancing.26 Neither of \nthese structures seems to contain much analytical purchase. First, beyond describing a world \nwithout a Leviathan, it is difficult to see what explanatory weight anarchy carries. The \nabsence of world government does not mean the absence of order. In various epochs in world \nhistory, empires, hegemons, and security communities have acted as the functional equivalent \nof Leviathans, laying down standards, both by force and by consent, and providing order \nwithin their sphere of control. In this sense, hierarchy is just as much a feature of world \npolitics as anarchy (Lake 1996; Wendt and Friedheim 1996; Cooley 2005; Hobson and \n                                                 \n24 \u2018States are free to disregard the imperatives of power, but they must expect to pay a price \nfor doing so\u2019. Waltz (2000:37). Quite how an imperative allows the actor to be free is not a \npoint that Waltz sees fit to comment upon. Nor is the price of this dereliction of structural \n(non) necessity explained in full. \n25 For such a central topic of analysis, power is a radically underdeveloped concept in \nInternational Relations. Power derives from the Latin word potere, which literally means \u2018to \nbe able\u2019. It has therefore normally been applied in the social sciences as a causal concept \nsignifying a capacity to effect people or events. Yet, in International Relations, power has \ntended to be used in a static sense to denote the distribution of resources and capabilities \nwithin the anarchical system. For alternative conceptions of power as a relational, dynamic \nprocess see Clegg (1989), Wrong (1995), Hindess (1996), and Stewart (2001). \n26 For Waltz (1979), the ideal international system is bipolar, as it offers the best chance of \nregularizing contact and minimizing conflict (although it is not without the risk of \noverreaction to small threats). Unipolarity is inherently unstable in that rival states will form \na coalition to challenge the sole power. Multipolarity is the most unstable system of all, \nproducing shifting alliances and the likelihood of unlimited war. On the potential benefits of \nhegemonic systems in which a single power is responsible for laying down and enforcing \nglobal rules, particularly in the sphere of international political economy, see Kindleberger \n(1973), and Gilpin (1981). \n20 \nSharman 2005). Institutions, formal in the sense of international laws, international \norganizations and treaties, and informal as carried by conventions, rules and standards of \nbehavior have long provided mechanisms through which international affairs can be \nconducted (Bull 1977, Reus-Smit 1997, Buzan 2004).27 If the international structure \ndetermined the form and function of its constituent parts, observable effects would follow \ndiscernible causes without room for unseen or collective action, unintended consequences, \ncreativity or surprise in world politics. How, then, to explain the capacity of a range of actors \n\u2013 OPEC in 1973, al-Qaida in 2001 among them \u2013 to act well beyond their underlying power \ncapabilities and generate substantive changes to the texture of world politics?28 \nIt is also difficult to weigh with any great certainty the impact of various forms of \npolarity. The contemporary world is often considered be unipolar, but this scarcely seems the \ncase in Europe, where, given both the hard power and the soft authority held by the European \nUnion (EU), and the current frostiness of the transatlantic alliance, the continent does not \nappear much like the lapdog of an overbearing hegemon.29 Nor is the US unrivalled in Asia, \nwhere China, India, Japan, and Pakistan all maintain countervailing tendencies to American \ninfluence, particularly when it comes to crunch security issues such as North Korea. Sub-\nSaharan Africa, for its part, is perhaps better seen as a sphere without structural authority; the \nMiddle East is a tinderbox region of arcane complexity. Thus, even a cursory glance at the \ncontemporary world displays multiple international systems in operation: a \u2018post-modern\u2019, \nKantian world inhabited by members of the European Union; a Lockean, modern system \n                                                 \n27 Nicholas Onuf (1998:61) puts this point simply: \u2018rules yield rule\u2019. On the capacity of \ninstitutions to generate \u2018governance without government\u2019 in the international realm, see \nRosenau (1991). For a more assessment of these issues, see Ruggie (2004). \n28 It should be noted that Waltz has somewhat rowed back from the idea of anarchy as \ndetermining state behaviour. Hence (2000:24), \u2018structures shape and shove, but they do not \ndetermine the actions of states\u2019.  \n29 Indeed, the parlous state of the transatlantic relationship has led some scholars to see \nEuropean states (among others) as beginning a process of \u2018soft balancing\u2019 against the United \nStates. On this, see Pape (2005), and Paul (2005). For a counter-argument, see Brooks and \nWohlforth (2005).   \n21 \nexperienced by the EU\u2019s \u2018near abroad\u2019; and the Hobbesian, \u2018pre-modern\u2019 conditions which \nare all too pervasive in much of sub-Saharan Africa.30  \nHistorically, too, there have been countless international systems, many of which have \noverlapped with each other. As Barry Buzan and Richard Little\u2019s (2000) extensive analysis of \ninternational systems throughout world history shows, the international system in Ancient \nGreece extended beyond city-states to embrace Carthage, Rome, Egypt, the Persian Empire \nand barbarian tribes, perhaps extending to India. At the height of the Roman Imperium, the \nHan Empire in China was bigger, more sophisticated, and featured a far higher level of \ncentralized authority than its Roman counterpart (Lieven 2001). Neither in terms of \ncontemporary world politics, nor with reference to the historical record, does it seem a \nstraightforward exercise even to determine the number of poles operating at any one time, let \nalone carry out an assessment of the logics that various polarities generate. Debates about the \nrelative stability and durability (or not) of unipolarity, the need to distinguish (or not) within \nthe broad category of multipolarity (for example, for a subset of tripolarity), and the lack of \nagreement about even the most basic characteristics of balancing, seems less a construction of \na progressive research program than a numbers game designed primarily to keep academics \nin gainful employment.31 All theories need to simplify reality in order to function as theories, \nbut when this process involves distorting history to such a degree, perhaps it is the theoretical \nexplanans itself that needs addressing.  \n                                                 \n30 Alexander Wendt (1999) identifies three \u2018cultures of anarchy\u2019 \u2013 Kantian, Lockean and \nHobbesian \u2013 depending on whether other states are seen as friends, rivals or foes. This is \nmirrored by work carried out by the British diplomat Robert Cooper (2000) who divides the \nworld into \u2018post-modern\u2019, \u2018modern\u2019 and  \u2018pre-modern\u2019 zones. \n31 This has not, of course, stopped scholars from constructing a cottage industry around issues \nof polarity. On this, see Waltz (1979), Gilpin (1981), Walt (1987, 2005), Christensen and \nSnyder (1990), Layne (1993), Schweller (1998), Wohlforth (1999), Waltz (2000). Recent \nwork on balancing can be found in Ikenberry (2002), Paul, Wirtz and Fortmann (2004), and \nSchweller (2004, 2006). \n22 \n An example helps to further illustrate this point. Paul Schroeder\u2019s (1994) study of \nEuropean inter-state politics between 1648 and 1945 indicates that states hid from threats, \nbandwagoned or tried to transcend problems more often than they pursued a strategy of \nbalancing. Different states facing the same threat nevertheless devised different strategies to \ndeal with them. Nor did the balance of power appear as a necessary axiom of European \npolitics; equilibrium was far less often the norm than asymmetries of power. The creation of \nthe Concert System during the first half of the nineteenth century was a deliberate attempt to \ndesign an interconnected system that could generate an \u2018equilibre politique\u2019 (Shroeder 1993) \nof functionally differentiated roles, duties and responsibilities.32 Crucially, it was not just \ninterests that bought the concert system together, but a shared sense of identity. State interests \nwere multiple and shifting rather than narrow and fixed, accommodating changes to both \ninternational and domestic contexts. Neither the move from feudal absolutism to \nconstitutionalist, bureaucratic nation-states, nor the machinations which saw the development \nof British mercantile ascendancy can be seen through the prism of the anarchic system \nalone.33 What parsimony gains in elegance, it appears to lose in empirical veracity.  \n                                                 \n32 In this way, Britain became the guarantor of balance, the protector of small states, and the \npromoter of commerce, while Russia was the guardian of the monarchical order, and \ndefender of ancien regimes against revolutionary outbursts. The Netherlands and Belgium, \nalong with other small states such as Switzerland, acted as neutral buffers between the great \npowers. This concert existed, as William Dougherty (1993) notes, beyond the existence of a \nFrench threat to European security; rather, it included the restored monarchy. \n33 It is worth looking at the debate which followed the publication of Schroeder\u2019s article, in \nparticular the reply by Elman and Elman (1995), and Schroeder\u2019s (1995) withering rebuttal. \nAs Schroeder writes (1995:194\u20135), Elman and Elman provide \u2018an elaborate word game \nexplaining and predicting nothing about the actual historical character of the international \nsystem \u2026 It (neo-realism) addresses only questions, the answers to which we know already, \nand its explanatory framework is the night in which all cows are black \u2026 it is not even \nwrong\u2019. Similarly, as Robert Jervis (1998) points out, it is not possible to explain the actions \nof Hitler\u2019s Germany or Stalin\u2019s Russia via anarchy, polarity or rational instrumentality. These \nstates were not driven by narrow self-interest or the necessary pursuit of security, but by a \ndesire to remake their domestic orders, and to reorder the world in this image.Much the same \ncould be said of revolutionary states over the past two hundred years or so. On this, see \nHalliday (1999) and Lawson (2005). \n23 \n Many contemporary realists seem to recognize the limits of the neorealist reverence \nfor third image parsimony. Hence, in recent years there has been a shift away from many of \nthe hardcore and auxiliary assumptions of structural realism in favor of a neo-classical \napproach that fills in (or perhaps does violence to) neorealist foundational axioms.34 Drawing \non the work of Thucydides, Carr, Morgenthau, Aron, Wolfers and others, neo-classical \nrealists such as William Wohlforth (1993), Thomas Christensen (1997), Fareed Zakaria \n(1998), Randall Schweller (1998, 2004, 2006), and Jennifer Sterling-Folker (2002) look at \nhow the systemic pressures afforded by anarchy are translated through unit-level intervening \nvariables, ranging from perceptions to civil-military relations. These scholars show that, \nwithout building in scope for ideology, perception, domestic state-society relations and the \nlike, structural accounts fail to explain why states balance or bandwagon, hide or transcend, \nchain-gang or buck-pass.  \n Much of the analysis offered by neo-classical realists bears what Wittgenstein might \ncall a \u2018family resemblance\u2019 to historical sociology. Historical sociology aims to unravel the \ncomplexity that lies behind the interaction between social action (both deliberate and \nunintentional) and structural forces (socially constructed but with an enduring authority and \ndynamic of their own). Hence, international factors are conjoined with domestic variables in \norder to find patterns that explain central social processes: wars, alliances, the rise and fall of \ngreat powers and so on. Over the last twenty years, research drawing on the nexus between \nhistorical sociology and IR has borne substantial fruit: analysis of the origins and varieties of \n                                                 \n34 Jeffrey Legro and Andrew Moravcsik (1999) doubt whether neo-classical realists can really \nbe seen as realists, given that the two variables that the two groups share \u2013 the retention of \nanarchy (and its consequent self-help system) and rationalism \u2013 are not sufficiently \ndistinctive to warrant the realist coat of arms. On the one hand, the shifting sands of realism \ncan be seen as a strength, providing what Michael Banks (in Guzzini 2004:544) calls a \n\u2018vacuum effect\u2019, in which anything valuable is swallowed in the name of the paradigm. But, \non the other hand, Legro and Moravcsik argue, if too much is allowed within the realist tent, \nthe paradigm becomes internally contradictory and externally overly promiscuous, begging \nthe question, \u2018Is anybody still a realist\u2019?  \n24 \ninternational systems over time and place (Watson 1992, Spruyt 1994, Buzan and Little \n2000), exposure of the \u2018myth of 1648\u2019 (Osiander 2001, Teschke 2003), analysis of the non-\nWestern origins of the contemporary world system (Wallerstein 1983, Gills 2002, Hobson \n2004), work on the co-constitutive relationship between the international realm and state-\nsociety relations in processes of radical change (Halliday 1999, Lawson 2005), examination \nof the social logic of international financial orders (Seabrooke 2006), and exploration of the \ninternational dimensions of modernity and globalisation (Rosenberg 1994a, 2005, 2006).  \n Scholars from other theoretical tribes are also contributing to this form of research. \nHence, Richard Price and Nina Tannenwald (1996) have used a historically sensitive, \ncomparative analysis to show how the non-use of nuclear and chemical weapons has, in large \npart, evolved over the last century from the interplay between a number of domestic and \ninternational factors, constructing a standard of civilization that prohibits the use of these \nweapons. Similarly, Martha Finnemore (1996, 2003) has illustrated how the norm of \nhumanitarian intervention has been constructed over time, starting with the protection of \nChristians from persecution by the Ottoman Empire, and carried via the fight against slavery \nand decolonization into a universal concept of humanity. The outcome of this journey was \nneither predetermined nor linear. Rather, it was the subject of conflicts played out \ndomestically and internationally, an uneven development that generated an overarching \nstructural norm within which international intervention could take place.35 In a comparable \nvein, Thomas Berger (1996) has shown how the national security roles of Germany and Japan \nrefute geopolitical interests and relative capabilities. Rather, identity, values and the culture \n                                                 \n35 Finnemore and Sikkink (1998) claim that the influence of norms in constituting change in \nworld politics is threefold. First, norms emerge, usually via individuals and groups who act as \n\u2018norm entrepreneurs\u2019 framing a particular issue and creating a critical mass of support for it, \nwhether that be women\u2019s rights, the abolition of slavery or banning landmines. Secondly, \nthrough processes of emulation, imitation and socialization, these norms cascade around the \nworld, carried via state departments, international organizations and epistemic networks. \nFinally, bureaucracies, both domestic and international, institutionalize the norms as \u2018taken-\nfor-granted\u2019 principles that are then formalized in policy. \n25 \nof foreign policy makers in these countries explains the relatively slight influence of these \ntwo great powers, at least militarily, on the contemporary world stage. Other constructivists \nsuch as Christian Reus-Smit (1999) and Michael Barnett (2002) also adopt a historical \nsociological take on the institutional underpinnings of international orders, and on the \nchanging functions of international organizations respectively. \n The work of these constructivists and neo-classical realists, allied to the work of other \nscholars such as Stephen Krasner (1999), John Ikenberry (2003), and Barry Buzan (2004), \nwho also apply historical-comparative methods within the English School, liberal and realist \ntraditions respectively, is not always self-identified as historical sociology. Yet it could be \ndescribed as such in that each of these studies is rooted in a diachronic understanding of the \ninternational realm, looking at how social action and social structures, and the social facts \nengendered by interaction between these two spheres, inhabit a domain of both continuity and \ndisjuncture. In the first instance, such works are empirically grounded studies of \u2018sufficient \nsimilarity\u2019, using several cases to generate causal patterns and wider inferences beyond either \na universalistic program or a collapse into indeterminacy.36 As such, these studies take place \nwithin a research tradition dating back to Max Weber\u2019s attempt to provide an empirically \nrich, comparative study of social facts which he used as a means to generate and evaluate a \ngeneral argument. This conjoining of interpretation and explanation (Verstehende Erkl\u00e4rung) \nuses awareness of particular contexts in order to derive a nuanced, causal explanation of \nideal-types that potentially contains a wider import. It is this approach that, I argue, contains \nfertile ground for the study of world politics. By tacking between empirical data, conceptual \nabstractions and causal explanations, as Michael Mann (1986a) puts it, \u2018carrying out a \n                                                 \n36 On the challenges and opportunities presented by case studies, process tracing and middle-\nrange theory in general (the most common methodological tools employed by historical \nsociologists), see Mahoney and Rueschemeyer (2003), and George and Bennett (2005). \n26 \nconstant conversation between the evidence and one\u2019s theory\u2019, it is possible to refine and \nrefute, engage with and accumulate knowledge.  \n As it has developed, historical sociology has been applied within a number of formal \ndisciplines and across a number of issue areas. Historical sociologists have asked important \nquestions, probed at interesting puzzles, provided some compelling hypothesis, and produced \nan array of empirical studies on subjects as varied as the transition from feudalism to \ncapitalism, and the development of manners. By adopting a historically sensitive, \ncomparative set of tools, historical sociologists have concentrated on how to link the broad \ncurrents of world politics with events on the ground, in other words how to marry \u2018organic \ntendencies\u2019 to historical happenstance. The principal question for historical sociologists \nworking with middle-range theory is, how is it possible to navigate a coherent path through \nthe complexities of world politics? What are the tools of correspondence that can mediate \nbetween international and domestic factors, material and normative issues, general and \ngenetic tendencies? What are the via medias that can incorporate the logic of both creative \nagency and structural authority, mediums capable of uncovering, in John Searle\u2019s (1995:5) \nwords, \u2018the structure of social reality\u2019?  \n  \n \nMeso-foundations \n \nA number of scholars have turned to the study of institutions as a means of finding just such a \nconduit. Advocates of the \u2018new institutionalism\u2019 (Powell and DiMaggio 1991; March and \nOlsen 1989; Steinmo, Thelen, and Longstreth 1992; Thelen 2004; Streeck and Thelen 2005) \nclaim that institutions can lay bare the dynamic between people\u2019s interests and preferences, \nand the standing conditions and patterned relations within which they act and which are \n27 \neffected by their agency. Institutions, for these scholars, are the sites where international and \ndomestic, material and normative factors, social facts and brute reality are joined.37  \nPerhaps the most prominent element of the \u2018new institutionalism\u2019 is a rational choice \napproach that understands institutions as stabilizing, constraining forces. For rational choice \nadvocates, institutions are coordinating mechanisms which sustain social equilibrium, a kind \nof social cartilage binding society together, and reducing the possibility of conflict. Much of \nthis view is rooted in a common sense understanding of institutions. After all, the British \nHouse of Lords and the US Supreme Court are, by their very nature, associated with \ncontinuity, stickiness and stasis. But as Kathleen Thelen (1999, 2004) points out, what gives \nthese institutions their staying power is actually their adaptability and capacity to evolve over \ntime. Institutional survival depends on flexibility: the House of Lords, for example, has \nresisted the extension of the franchise and concomitantly, the increased legitimacy of the \nHouse of Commons, as well as the removal of hereditary peers and various attempts to \nreform it out of existence. Likewise, as Stephen Krasner (1999) examines, the long-\nestablished principle of sovereignty has endured precisely because of the multiplicity of \nmeanings and interpretations that have been attached to it. Institutions may be sticky, but they \nalso appear to move. \nFollowing Thelen and others, an alternative group of scholars, sometimes referred to \nas \u2018sociological\u2019 or \u2018historical institutionalists\u2019, focus on how institutions develop and adapt \nrather than on how they function. As such, institutions are not conceived as timeless variables \nperforming a universal task, but particular to time and place, and requiring reproduction \n(positive feedback) in order to keep pace with changing norms and material contexts. \nMargaret Weir (1992), for example, sees institutions as engaged in \u2018bounded innovation\u2019. For \n                                                 \n37 Much of the sociological literature on institutions is drawn from work originating in \neconomic history and, in particular, from the pioneering studies of Douglass North (1990, \n2004), and Brian Arthur (1994). \n28 \nWeir, once changes are \u2018locked-in\u2019, they are difficult to shift; small initial differences can \nbecome substantial ones over time.38 By the very nature of the interplay between agency and \nstructural context, institutions are examples of \u2018bricolage\u2019 in which layers of changes take \nplace over the top of others. Institutional innovation is the norm, but only on top of existing \nfoundations and within set parameters. Institutions are at once sites of change, reproduction \nand transformation, a means of unraveling the continuity and disjuncture of domestic and \ninternational orders.  \n The main problem with the use of institutions in IR is the neorealist and \ninstitutionalist conception of institutions as functional necessities for generating order.39 In \nother words, states seek to exploit their power and reduce security threats by necessity, often \nthrough designing institutions, brittle or robust as they may be. For neorealists, institutions \nare reflections of state power and the relative distribution of capabilities. In other words, \ninstitutions are doubly yoked, firstly to state interests, and by dint of this subservience, for a \nsecond time within the structure of international anarchy. Thus for Mearsheimer (1990, \n1995), Krasner (1991), Waltz (2000) and others, institutions serve at the whim of the great \npowers or hegemons, to be used, abused and ignored as needs dictate. The first cut of \ninstitutional theory, for these scholars, should be an analysis of divergent national power \ncapabilities. As Stephen Krasner (1991) argues, on issues where there are disagreements \nabout basic principles and norms that underwrite institutions, or if there is a radical \nasymmetry of power between states, then institutions are unlikely to develop or endure. \nBecause institutions rely on the great powers for their very existence, any effect they have is \n                                                 \n38 On the importance of time, sequence and positive feedback processes to the development \nof institutions and political orders, see Abbott (1990, 2001), Aminzade (1992), Arthur (1994), \nErtman (1997), Isaac (1997), Goldstone (1998), Mahoney (2000), Katznelson (2003), Pierson \n(2004), and Sewell (2005). \n39 A comprehensive discussion of neorealist and institutionalist positions can be found in \nKoremenos, Lipson and Snidal (2001).  \n29 \nweak and inconsequential, limited to those situations in which power capabilities are more or \nless equal, and shared interests and mutual gains will follow.  \n For institutional theorists, institutions are designed to deliver absolute, if suboptimal, \ngains under conditions of anarchy.40 Because there are only \u2018thin\u2019 push factors towards \ncooperation in the international realm, states create institutions in order to overcome \ncollective action problems, reduce transaction costs, lessen incentives for cheating, facilitate \ninformational flows, shorten the shadow of the future by transparently providing anticipated \nreturns, and distribute capabilities more evenly. As such, they are focal points for \ncooperation, providing essential monitoring and information tasks that can deliver what John \nMearsheimer (1995) describes (or derides) as \u2018distributional gains\u2019. The creation and \nmaintenance of institutions engenders system equilibrium and therefore, some degree of \nstability.41 In this way, institutionalists are attempting to augment rather than subvert \nneorealism. As Robert Keohane and Lisa Martin (2003:42) put it, \u2018by seeking to specify the \nconditions under which institutions can have an impact and cooperation can occur, \ninstitutional theory shows under what conditions realist propositions are valid\u2019.  \nInstitutional theory has, as proponents admit, not done enough testing ex ante difficult \ncases; often there has been a selection bias in the choice of non-random, restricted cases by \nwhich to examine the theory. Moreover, the question over whether institutions act as \ndependent or independent variables in specific cases has led to questions about the problem \nof endogeneity that the theory contains.42 For their part, neorealists have yet to explain the \n                                                 \n40 Some institutionalists argue that, in certain cases, gains may be relative rather than \nabsolute. Hence, Keohane and Martin (2003) agree that the interests of states may diverge in \nterms of the distribution of gains, particularly between strong and weak states. In this sense, \nthere is no agreement about what Stephen Krasner (1991) calls the \u2018Pareto frontier\u2019: the realm \nof mutual gains. \n41 An exploration of the institutional dimensions of international order contained in post-war \nsettlements is offered by Ikenberry (2001). \n42 A problem recognised by some of its proponents, for example, Keohane and Martin (2003). \n30 \nendurance and increasing density of institutions in global affairs.43 Even if institutions are \nendogenous to state interests and international structure, they are not necessarily \nepiphenomena. For example, in situations of multiple equilibria, institutions may exert a \nconsiderable degree of agency and independence. International institutions often establish a \nrelative autonomy from the states that set them up by constructing categories of actors (like \nrefugees), promoting new interests (such as human rights), or transferring models of political \nassociation around the world (in particular, democracy). As work on principal-agent theory \nshows (Gould 2003, 2004), international financial institutions like the IMF have a fair degree \nof latitude vis-\u00e0-vis their apparent masters. Once set up, international institutions often move \nin ways quite removed from their intended function, generating inconvenient commitments in \nthe process. Thus, the states that have created the International Criminal Court are also \nsubject to its jurisdiction, and European states that have chosen to pool economic decision \nmaking in a continent-wide central bank are thereafter constrained by its decisions.  \n Work by Michael Barnett and Martha Finnemore (1999, 2004) has indicated the \nextent to which international institutions assign meaning and normative values to certain \nmodes of behavior, helping to construct and constitute the social world in their image. By \ncarrying out the \u2018duties of office\u2019 and \u2018doing their job\u2019, international institutions control \ninformation and establish a level of expertise that states cannot possess. This specialized \nknowledge shapes rather than merely implements the policy directives of states. Hence, UN \npeacekeepers have an authority that stems from their role as neutral, independent actors \nimplementing Security Council resolutions. The World Bank classifies who can be \nconsidered \u2018peasants\u2019, \u2018farmers\u2019 and \u2018laborers\u2019, and asserts its authority by dictating the \ncontent and direction of global development programs. The United Nations High \n                                                 \n43 Michael Barnett (2002) calculates that, while in 1860 there were just five international \ninstitutions and one international NGO, by 1940, there were 61 and 477 respectively; by the \nturn of the millennium, there were 260 international institutions and over 5,000 international \nNGOs. \n31 \nCommissioner for Refugees has the power to set up camps, and make life and death \ndecisions, without recourse to consultation with the UN\u2019s member states. International \ninstitutions fix meanings, establish rules, and transmit norms around the international realm.44 \nIn this way, they can act as agents of progressive change rather than as conservative \nconstraints or as mechanisms of the status-quo ante. \n Similarly, institutions are not functionally determined. Some international institutions, \nlike the European Union, take on rather more functions than was originally intended, while \nothers such as the Arab League, the Organization of American States and the African Union, \ndo less. As Adam Ferguson (in Onuf 2002:215) wrote over two hundred years ago, \n\u2018institutions are the result of human action, but not the execution of human design\u2019. Many \ninternational institutions move well away from the vision of their founders. The \u2018switch \ncosts\u2019 of changing or abolishing institutions once they are established, despite changes in \noverarching structural conditions, engenders a degree of path dependence (Keohane and \nMartin 2003). Thus, the UN Security Council, set up to reflect post-war power capabilities, \nhas to date resisted calls for fundamental reform of its make-up and functions despite the \nstructural shift that accompanied the end of the Cold War. Nineteenth century governmental \ndepartments set up to meet the challenges of the industrial age persist despite their lack of \nsuccess in tackling the thorniest issues of the information economy. As changes occur to the \ncontext within which they were formed, institutions generate effects and exhibit a capacity \nfor persistence beyond endogenous interests, preferences, and the overarching structure \nwithin which they act. \n Importantly, institutions are sites of conflict as well as tools of consensus. Disputes in \nthe UN Security Council in the lead-up to war in Iraq, the turmoil prompted by the failure of \n                                                 \n44 As Barnett and Finnemore (1999, 2004) acknowledge, this does not mean that international \ninstitutions necessarily carry out these roles well. Factionalism, turf wars, cumbersome \ndecision-making processes, and self-insulated elites do not make for high-quality policy \nmaking. \n32 \nthe European Union to agree a draft constitution, and the seemingly ceaseless tensions \nprompted by processes of EU enlargement, all indicate the ways in which institutions are \nunits of political contestation.45 Institutional conflicts and decay go well beyond \u2018punctuated \nequilibrium\u2019 (Krasner 1984:224) in which institutions lose their \u2018stickiness\u2019.46 The process of \ndeinstitutionalization is also crucial to world affairs, consider the cases of the abolition of \nslavery, or the decline of imperialism and colonialism with all the consequences than ensued. \nInstitutions such as human rights and humanitarian intervention clash with those of \nsovereignty and self-determination; international political and economic institutions often \ndiverge. Hence, while the UN was condemning the Chilean junta led by General Pinochet \nduring its period of dictatorship, the IMF and World Bank were propping up the regime \nthrough beneficial loan agreements. \nLikewise, neither neorealism nor institutional theory deals adequately with variation \nin terms of time and place. As David Stasavage (2004) points out, the optimal design of \ninstitutions varies according to changing needs, levels of public opinion, and the legitimacy \nof the institution. Despite operating under apparently equivalent structural conditions, \nAthenian hegemony favored third-party arbitration or what Christian Reus-Smit (1997) calls \n\u2018trilateralism\u2019, while the contemporary American version, for the most part, veers between \nmultilateralism, unilateralism, and bilateralism.47 The degree to which the Bush \n                                                 \n45 This is a particular problem for institutionalists, who claim that institutions are essentially \nderived from out of the need for cooperation. The result is an acceptance, at least by some \ninstitutionalists (Keohane and Martin 2003), that in certain cases, particularly those featuring \nlarge asymmetries of power, interests may diverge and gains may be relative rather than \nabsolute. \n46 In using this term, Krasner is applying a term first mooted by the biologist Stephen Jay \nGould to describe the switch-points in which long periods of stable reproduction within \ncomplex systems are punctuated by short periods of rapid change. \n47 James Lindsay, an analyst at the Council for Foreign Relations and a former adviser to \nPresident Clinton, calls this \u2018multilateralism \u00e0 la carte\u2019. Mark Leonard, Director of the British \nForeign Policy Centre, is more explicit, writing that the Bush administration has hit a \n\u2018geopolitical pause button\u2019 which is \u2018unilateralist if we care about it, multilateralism if we \n33 \nadministration and its unilateralist perambulations have moved away from Clintonian \nmultilateralism is striking; it also indicates that multilateralism is no necessary impulse \ndirected by the structure of the international system. As John Ruggie (1998) posits, if \nGermany had won World War Two, it seems scarcely credible to hold that world politics \nwould feature the same predilection for multilateralism as it does today. Rather, \nmultilateralism took the form it did precisely out of a need to rebuild and contain the imperial \npretensions of the Soviet Union, Germany and Japan, while at the same time bolstering the \ntransatlantic alliance. Hence, it is not hegemony alone, as neorealist and institutional theory \nwould have it, but US hegemony that explains the position of multilateralism in the world \ntoday, predominant or subaltern as it may be. \nFinally, institutions are not just effects, they are also causes. In other words, they are \nconstitutive rather than merely regulative. For John Ruggie (1998), the failure to understand \nhow institutions constitute as well as regulate activity in world politics is the principal failing \nof the neorealist and institutionalist research traditions, missing out the way in which the \nnorm of reciprocal sovereignty must be recognized before the state-system can operate \neffectively; how property rights have to be established before a market economy can \nfunction; and how the principle of exclusive territoriality exists prior to the actualization of \nguiding structures like the sovereign state. Barry Buzan (2004) has usefully explored the rise, \nconsolidation, decay, and demise of international institutions over time, dividing institutions \ninto \u2018primary\u2019 or \u2018master\u2019 types (shared practices rooted in common values), and secondary, \nderivative norms, rules, and practices. Hence, for Buzan, sovereignty is the fundamental \nground rule which generates international law and non-intervention, in turn engendering \ninternational organizations like the UN and the International Criminal Court. The master \ninstitution of the market is derivative of trade liberalization and, in turn, global financial \n                                                                                                                                                        \ndon\u2019t.\u2019 Mark Leonard, \u2018The burning of Bush\u2019, Financial Times Weekend Magazine, 26 June \n2004:6. \n34 \narchitecture like the WTO and the IMF.48 Crucially, as Buzan points out, even primary \ninstitutions, although enduring, are not eternally fixed. Hence, dynasticism and colonialism, \nboth deep institutions from past international systems, have faded to the extent that they are, \nto all intents and purposes, no longer legitimate dimensions of policy-making practices. \nInstitutions may be binding forces but they can also become unstuck. The world does not \ncome pre-constituted; it is not a ready-meal.  \nThe utility of using institutions as analytical tools comes from the ways in which their \nlink material practices with symbolic construction, helping to understand how capitalism is \nconcretized through property rights, ownership and contracts; Christianity becomes \u2018solid\u2019 \nthrough prayer and the ritual of church-going; and democracy is formalized by voting, \nparliamentary debates, legislation and so on. Institutions operate at the nexus of the material \nand social worlds, or what Barry Buzan (2004) calls the explicit and implicit ends of social \naction. As such, they can be understood as conjunctions of social construction and material \nforces. Institutions are at once rules and roles, interests and identities, practices and \nprinciples. They are units where structure and agency, material and ideational factors, conflict \nand cooperation, intentional action and unintended consequences, continuity and disjuncture \ncome together. As such, they are an ideal via media for addressing what, at first sight, appear \nto be unbridgeable dichotomies, and of helping to provide analytical order in a world of \nsometimes bewildering complexity. The primary connections that individuals experience are \nwithin networks of shared interests and identity. Institutionalization is the formalization of \nthese networks of shared interests and identity through adopting common rules, norms and \n                                                 \n48 On the \u2018constitutional\u2019 role of international institutions, see Reus-Smit (1997), and Holsti \n(2004). \n35 \npractices. Institutions are the result of this process, defined as sets of common \nunderstandings, rules and practices operating in a particular field.49  \nMembers of institutions, domestic and international, are always relatively free to \narticulate their interests, position themselves strategically and fix their relationships vis-\u00e0-vis \nothers. As practices, norms and procedures are repeated and institutionalized, so the dynamic \nis reproduced and space opens up for new connections, relationships and networks to be \ninstitutionalized. Although they are inhibited by processes of rule making, supervision and \nregulation, such structures are not wholly constraining, they are also enabling and generative, \nopen to negotiation and resistance. Delegation always features some degree of discretion and \ninterpretation (agency), even if this takes place within set parameters and rules (structures). \nInstitutions represent tangible sites in which to study the interplay of social action and social \nchange as this is carried through in a number of research settings: exploring varieties of state-\nsociety relations and the particular logics which are generated from these relations (Mann \n1986b); unraveling the transformation capacity of contemporary revolutions (Lawson 2005); \nor examining the deep-lying changes to the generative grammar of world politics over time \nand place (Bull 1977, Holsti 2004, Buzan 2004). As such, the potential of applying mid-range \nhistorical sociology, focusing on institutions as via medias par excellence, provides a strong \ncounterweight to mainstream IR theory\u2019s functionalist straightjacket.   \n \n \nThe promise of historical sociology \n \nThis article has explored how historical sociology and, in particular, how one of its variants \u2013 \nhistorical institutionalism \u2013 can add value to the study of International Relations.50 The \n                                                 \n49 By fields, I mean what is usually referred to in IR as \u2018issue areas\u2019, for example energy, the \nenvironment or security. \n36 \npotential impact of the (historical) sociological turn on the micro, macro and meso-\nfoundations are fourfold. First, there is historical sociology\u2019s general orientation towards a \ndiachronic rather than a synchronic understanding of the international realm. The rejection of \nuniversal, timeless categories and their replacement by multilinear theories of world historical \ndevelopment gives history the chance to breathe, and agency the chance to make a difference. \nThe result is what we might call, pace William Sewell (1996), an \u2018eventful\u2019 IR enterprise. \nSuch a move rejects pseudo-scientific accounts of pre-determined outcomes rooted in system \nfunctions, expected utility and material capabilities, opting instead for an awareness of \ncontingency, uncertainty and unintended consequences within broad structural constraints. In \nturn, this promotes a more nuanced, complex picture of the principal causal flows that lie at \nthe heart of world historical development, and allows for differentiation between types of \nsocial facts: empires, wars, and revolutions among them. Historical sociology in IR is a \nresearch program in which empirical work, theoretical awareness, and methodological rigor \nare seen as mutually important features. Taking the simple motif \u2013 \u2018history matters\u2019 \u2013 as its \nfirst order maxim, historical sociology aims to trace and examine the slow moving processes, \nsequences, and developmental paths that can, and should, constitute the principal points of \nenquiry in the discipline. \n Second, historical sociology opens up the possibility of more effective periodization \nwithin IR. If contexts, structures and social facts move, and if there is a patterning to these \nprocesses, then a conjunctural analysis that looks both inwards at the empirical detail of an \nera, and also outwards at its broader causal constellations provides a potentially rich \n                                                                                                                                                        \n50 It is important to emphasise that institutionalism is just one variant within the broad corpus \nof \u2018third wave\u2019 historical sociology. For a wide-ranging introduction into the varieties of \ncontemporary historical sociology, see the contributions in Adams, Clemens, and Orloff \n(2005), and, in particular, the chapter by Magubane (2005) which explicitly opens up \nhistorical sociology towards post-colonial studies and the wider \u2018cultural turn\u2019 within the \nhuman sciences. For a critique of the \u2018domestication\u2019 of historical sociology within \nmainstream social and political science, see Calhoun (1996). \n37 \nunderstanding of eras and epochs in world history (Rosenberg 2005, pace Braudel 1972). For \nexample, by renewing interest in temporality and, in turn, into the various logics within \nwhich world history takes place, the Westphalian moment, and indeed the entire modern \nEuropean states-system, becomes just one part in a much wider canvass (Frank 1998; Gills \n2002; Hobson 2006). In other words, if Westphalia is a moment within a broader \u2018age of \nempires\u2019, then it is open to question about precisely what its impact is: as a critical juncture \nwhich generated sufficient positive feedback mechanisms that its principal dimension (the \nmutual recognition of state sovereignty) became locked-in and, therefore, increasingly \nresistant to change; or as an event which did little more than change the rationale by which \nimperial polities could legitimately subsume other polities.  \n In a similar vein, adopting a historical sociological view of globalisation means \ncritically assessing the extent to which, firstly, the post-war era characterised by popular \nsovereignty and nationalism is being superseded by an epoch defined primarily by \nglobalisation and de-territorialization, and secondly, the extent to which these processes are \nthemselves rooted in much longer-term historical trajectories which have proceeded, if not \nlinearly, then at least sequentially, to the present day. Sensitising IR researchers to these tools \nof analysis and to this way of thinking contributes to an open-ended research programme into \nrelatively uncharted territories: the production, reproduction, reform, and recasting of primary \nand derivative institutions which flow out of, and which form, particular structural \nconjunctures; the relationship between initial choices, developmental paths, critical junctures, \nand transformation in issues as varied as state formation and systems change; and \ninvestigation of the forces that act as principia media in driving macro-level processes of \nsocial change. At the heart of the historical sociological imagination is understanding the \nimportance of time and place variation \u2013 the idea that development has both temporal and \nspatial dimensions that need to be both theoretically and empirically problematized.  \n38 \n The third major benefit of historical sociology in IR lies in its capacity to debunk \ntaken-for-granted assumptions about central concepts and myths of origin in the discipline. \nStudying systems change, monitoring the emergence of the concept of anarchy, and \nconducting historical-comparative work into the functioning of the balance of power over \ntime and place, illustrates how the core concepts of the discipline are made to appear natural \nwhen in fact they are rooted in particular historical conjunctures. To this end, ongoing work \ninto the social theory of world historical development (Rosenberg 2006), the origins of the \ncontemporary international system (Teschke 2003), the eastern origins of western civilization \n(Hobson 2004) and the like, present an alternative picture of the principal flows, patterns and \ndirectional processes within world politics that are relevant not just around the margins of the \ndiscipline, but speak to its very heart. A reminder of the need to study \u2018in\u2019 history rather than \n\u2018outside\u2019 history is a useful corrective to the tendency of scholars in IR to misapply abstract, \ntimeless variables to ill-fitting contexts. After all, once they are applied, general abstractions \nsoon reach their limits.  \nFinally, this article has looked at how historical sociology in at least one of its guises \n\u2013 historical institutionalism \u2013 can help to redirect understanding of institutions within IR. \nPotentially, institutions have the capacity to help unravel and guide researches through the \nintricacies, complexity and turbulence of world politics, but only if they are understood \nbeyond the straightjacket afforded to them by much mainstream IR theory. This allows \nhistorical sociology to take its place among the number of paradigms which are seeking to \npush the discipline away from a narrow view of rationalism, a limited conception of social \nstructure, and a concomitant failure to see the dynamism of the process (captured in this \narticle by the logic of institutions), that lies between and across these spheres. Historical \ninstitutionalism is offered here as one part of a general turn in IR theory away from \nparsimonious parlor games, bunkerist retreats to theoretical isolationalism, and banal \n39 \nabstractions masquerading as timeless truths. Rather, historical institutionalism, and historical \nsociology more generally, offers a means of embracing the nuance, subtleties and \ncomplexities of world politics without abdication from the overarching goal of finding \nmeaningful causal flows, patterns and trends within processes of world historical \ndevelopment.  \nAs this article has explored, the research projects that arise from such an enterprise \nmay be conducted from a myriad of different starting points. Some neoclassical realist, \nliberal, constructivist and English School theorists have adopted a form of historical \nsociological reasoning in studying the formation and development of post-war settlements, \nalliances, empires, global norms, and international systems across time and place. Historical \nsociology aims to add to this resurgence in empirically aware, theoretically rigorous and \nmethodologically scrupulous research \u2013 research that constitutes a return-to-normal for IR as \na discipline (Hobden 1998, 2002). In this sense, historical sociology is part of an open \nconversation that recognizes both the relative autonomy of each approach but also the \ncommon ground that unites them. And given this starting point, the promise of historical \nsociology in International Relations is rich indeed. \n40 \nReference List \n \nAbbott, Andrew.
