Introduction 25 \nThis paper significantly extends a previous study of the ionic \nconductivities at temperatures between 20 - 80\u00b0C of radiation-\ngrafted alkaline anion-exchange membranes (AAEM), the OH-\n-analogues of proton-exchange membranes (PEMs) such as \nNafion\u00ae by Du Pont;1 this earlier study was limited to the 30 \ninvestigation of the conductivities of \npoly(tetrafluoroethyelene-co-hexafluoropropylene), FEP = -\n[CF2CF2]n-[CF(CF3)CF2]m-, based AAEMs whilst submerged \nin water (i.e. fully hydrated). The main conclusions were: \na) The conductivities of fully hydrated radiation-grafted 35 \nAAEMs (\u03bb = 27 \u00b1 2 water molecules per OH- ion at room \ntemperature) synthesised from 50 \u03bcm thick FEP precursor \nfilms did not perceptibly vary with degrees of grafting \nbetween 21 \u2013 25%. \nb) Conductivities at 50\u00b0C of 0.022 \u00b1 0.003 S cm-1 were 40 \ndemonstrated with these fully hydrated AAEMs (84 \u00b1 2 \n\u03bcm thick), which correspond to 20% of the 0.104 \u00b1 0.008 S \ncm-1 achieved with fully hydrated Nafion-115 PEM (153 \u00b1 \n3 \u03bcm thick, \u03bb = 24 \u00b1 2) at 50\u00b0C; therefore thinner \nmembranes are mandatory for the AAEMs to minimise 45 \nabsolute resistances. \nc) The empirical activation energies for the AAEMs in the \nrange 20 - 95\u00b0C, measured from empirical Arrhenius plots, \nare double those found for Nafion-115 (12.6 \u00b1 0.6 kJ mol-1 \nand 6.0 \u00b1 0.8 kJ mol-1 respectively); therefore maximising 50 \nthe operating temperature of these AAEMs (i.e. improving \nthermal stability) will reduce the gap between the \nconductivities of AAEMs and Nafion PEMs. \n This type of AAEM is of considerable interest in the field \nof fuel cells; a recent review describes in detail the advantages 55 \nand disadvantages of this application of AAEM electrolytes2 \nand so, for conciseness, these details will not be repeated. A \nsignificant problem with the above FEP-based AAEMs is the \nlack of physical strength; they tear easily and demonstrate \ncritically poor durability when assembled in fuel cells. 60 \nSubsequent breakthroughs in radiation-grafted AAEM \ntechnology and membrane electrode assembly fabrication \n(development of a novel alkaline electrode interface polymer), \nrelevant to application in fuel cells, have been reported in two \nrecent communications.3,4  65 \n This article details the effect of relative humidity (RH) on \nionic conductivities, water uptake properties and stability \nagainst excessive swelling of a variety of AAEMs at a \ntemperature of 30\u00b0C; this includes measurements on a \nrecently developed class of AAEM based on poly(ethylene-70 \nco-tetrafluoroethylene), ETFE = -(CH2CH2)n-(CF2CF2)m-, \nprecursor films, that are substantially more durable than the \nFEP-based AAEMs.3 The primary aim of this investigation is \nto gain a physical insight into the currently unknown \nbehaviour of quaternary-ammonium AAEMs under reduced 75 \nhumidity conditions.

Materials and methods 80 \n2.1. Synthesis of alkaline anion-exchange membranes \nThe synthetic protocol for radiation-grafted AAEMs has been \ndescribed in detail in reference1 and will only be summarised \nhere (Scheme 1); this methodology was chosen as it avoids the \nrequirement of a final film formation step \u2013 preformed films 85 \nare functionalised. Reverse osmosis (RO) water was used \nthroughout this study. The fully fluorinated FEP or partially \nfluorinated ETFE films (both 50 \u03bcm thick and purchased from \nGoodfellow) were irradiated with a 60Co \u03b3-ray source \n(Defence Academy of the United Kingdom), Cranfield 90 \nUniversity, Shrivenham, UK) in air at a temperature of 23 \u00b1 \n1\u00b0C to a total dose of 7 MRad (dose rate of 0.04 MRad h-1) \nand stored at \u201337 \u00b1 3\u00b0C until required. Vinylbenzyl chloride \n(VBC, Dow Chemicals) was stored in a refrigerator and used \nundiluted as the grafting monomer after being purged with 95 \nnitrogen for 2 h and without removal of 4-tert-butylcatechol \nand nitromethane inhibitors. The degree of grafting (d.o.g., %) \nof the FEP\/ETFE-g-poly(VBC) intermediate membranes were \ncalculated as follows: \nwhere mg is the mass of grafted sample and mi is the initial 100 \nmass of the irradiated films. \n These intermediate membranes were subsequently \nsubmerged in aqueous trimethylamine (Acros, 50% by mass) \nfor 4 h to yield the desired quaternary ammonium exchange \nsites. After washing several times in water the resulting 105 \nhydrophilic membranes (now as chloride-forms) were boiled \nin water for 1 h (to remove residual trimethylamine and to \nfully hydrate the membranes) and finally washed in water \nseveral more times. Final conversion to the alkaline-forms \nwas conducted as follows: the membranes were submerged in 110 \naqueous potassium hydroxide (Fisher Scientific, 1.0 mol dm-3, \nat least 10 times excess) for 1 h with two changes of \npotassium hydroxide solution during this period to ensure \ncomplete ion-exchange (important to obtain maximum ion-\nexchange capacities). The resulting AAEMs were then soaked 115 \nin water to remove any lingering \/ occluded potassium \nhydroxide species. The desired radiation-grafted AAEMs \u201cas-\nsynthesised\u201d were stored in water until required and were not \nallowed to dry out at any point before measurements were \nconducted. 120 \n Nafion-115 was evaluated for benchmarking purposes and \nalso to allow a link to previous conductivity and water uptake \nwork in the literature. Nafion\u00ae-115 was subjected to the \nstandard hydrogen peroxide and sulfuric acid pre-treatment \nbefore use.5 A thicker commercial quaternary ammonium type 125 \nAAEM was also evaluated; the physical properties of this \nAAEM, which is of comparable thickness to Nafion-115 when \nboth are fully hydrated, have been previously reported in \ndetail.6 This AAEM also contains additional cross-linking \n(undisclosed proprietary information). Despite the lack of 130 \nsynthetic and chemical details regarding this ionomer, its \ninclusion in this study yields interesting and corroboratory \ninformation relating to conductivities and water uptakes (see \nSections 3.3 and 3.4). Ion-exchange of this membrane to the \nalkaline form from the supplied Cl--form was conducted using 135 \nthe same procedure as for the radiation-grafted AAEMs. The \nETFE-AAEM (d.o.g. = 23.6 %, Scheme 1), FEP-AAEM \n(d.o.g. = 23.7 %), and crosslinked-AAEM are designated \nAAEM-E, F, and C respectively. \n2.2 Determination of physical properties at each RH 140 \nThe thicknesses (determined using an outside micrometer of 2 \n\u03bcm precision), areas, and masses of multiple samples of each \nmembrane were recorded after equilibration for at least 7 days \nover either water, constant humidity solutions or a desiccant \n(Table 1)7 in sealed desiccators that had been placed in an 145 \noven set to 30 \u00b1 1\u00b0C. Before these measurements were \nconducted the same properties were determined using the \nsame samples but in the fully hydrated, labelled FH, form (i.e. \n\u201cas-synthesised\u201d: immediately after the water soaking \/ \nwashing treatment that followed the aqueous KOH ion-150 \nexchange procedure). The re-hydrated properties were \nrecorded when the fully dehydrated membranes (7 days over \nanhydrous CaCl2(s)) were equilibrated in a RH=100% \natmosphere for at least 7 days. All errors in this study relate to \none sample standard deviation for multiple measurements 155 \nover different samples of the same membranes.  \n The water uptakes for each membrane at each RH, WURH, \nwere calculated using: \nwhere mRH is the mass at each RH and m0% is the mass of the \nfully dehydrated membrane samples.

The volume increases, \u03b8RH, were calculated in a \nslightly different way to be consistent with the widely 165 \nreported values of this parameter for PEMs in the literature:8,9 \nwhere V represents the volumes of the ionomer samples. The \ndensities of each membrane at each RH, \u03c1RH, were calculated \nas follows: \n The previously reported1 standard back titration method 170 \nwas used to calculate the OH- ion-exchange capacity of the \nfully dehydrated AAEM, IEC0% \/ mol(OH-) g-1. Similarly the \nequivalent ion-exchange capacity of Nafion-115, mol(H+) g-1, \ncan be determined. The ion-exchange capacities at each RH, \nIECRH, can then be calculated from this value and the ratio of 175 \nthe fully dehydrated mass \/ mass of the same sample of \nmembrane at each RH: \nFrom these values, the concentration of OH- ions (or H+ ions) \nin the membrane, [OH-] \/ mol dm-3, at each RH can be \ndetermined: 180 \nFinally the water content, \u03bbRH, the number of water molecules \nper OH- ion for AAEMs (or per H+ ion for Nafion-115), of \neach membrane at each RH was calculated using the equation: \nwhere the molecular weight of water, MWwater, was taken as \n18.015 g mol-1. 185 \n2.3. Measurement of conductivities \nThe method for measuring the normal (through membrane) \nconductivities followed the impedance spectroscopy approach \nrecently reported by Pozio et al..5,10 Impedance spectra were \nrecorded with a Solartron 1260 frequency response analyser \/ 190 \n1287 electrochemical interface combination controlled by \nZPlot v.1 software (Scribner Associates) with data analysis of \nthe Nyquist plots using ZView v.2 software (Scribner \nAssociates); these plot Zim vs. Zreal of the complex plane \nvector  Z(\u03c9) = R + j\u03c7, where the resistance R = Zreal, the 195 \nreactance \u03c7 = Zim, \u03c9 = 2\u03c0f (f is the frequency of the a.c. \nvoltage pertubation), and j = 1\u2212 . \nThe AAEMs (or Nafion-115), cut to circular diameter = 1.39 \ncm, were pressed between two single-sided carbon-powder-\ncoated carbon cloth electrodes (E-Tek: A-6 ELAT\/SS\/NC\/V2, 200 \ncarbon only - no metal catalyst, thickness = 355 \u03bcm, circular \ndiameter \u03c6 = 1.13 \u00b1 0.02 cm (area A = 1.00 \u00b1 0.04 cm2) with \nthe powder side pressed to the membrane) at 150 \u00b1 50 kg cm-2 \nat 60\u00b0C for 3 min. After pressing, the resulting membrane \nelectrode assemblies (MEAs) were stored in water for at least 205 \n12 h prior to conductivity measurements. The cell design, with \ncircular graphite plates, is similar to that previously reported \nby Pozio (see Fig. 2 in reference 5), the only difference being \nthat ELAT A-6 carbon cloth electrodes were used instead of \nToray carbon paper. The conductivities of the fully hydrated 210 \nmembranes, \u03c3FH \/ S cm-1, were measured with the cell \nassembly submersed in a beaker of water at controlled \ntemperature so that all of the MEA was submerged; the gold \njack plug (for electrical connection) were kept outside of the \nwater.1 The conductivities in the RH=100% to RH=33% range 215 \nwere conducted with the cell assembly suspended above (not \nin) the constant humidity solutions. RH=0% measurements \nwere conducted with the cell assembly suspended above \nanhydrous CaCl2(s); however, at RH=0%, with this cell \ndesign, the resistances and capacitances of all of the AAEM 220 \nsamples were such that it was not possible to measure the \nmembrane resistances\/conductivities with any confidence in \nthe frequency range available on the instruments. Impedance \nspectra were recorded between frequencies f = 1 MHz \u2013 1 Hz \n(7 steps per decade), 50 mV root mean squared voltage 225 \nperturbation, and integration of the responses over 10 cycles. \nRtot (the sum of the membrane, Rmem, and cell resistance, Rcell) \nwas taken as the intercept with the x-axis (see Figure 2 in \nReference 1). Rcell was determined by impedance \nmeasurements for a blank cell containing two ELAT A-6 230 \nelectrodes pressed together in an identical manner to that \ndescribed above (no membrane therefore forming an electrical \nshort circuit). Nafion-115 MEAs were prepared in a similar \nmanner to that above, with the following slight modifications: \nthe MEAs were pressed at 135\u00b0C for 3 min and the MEAs 235 \nwere boiled in water for 2 h after preparation to ensure the \nexpanded form was recovered after the hot pressing;5 this \nprocedure was deliberately adopted to allow comparison with \nliterature data. These acidic benchmark MEAs were also \nstored in water until required for impedance spectroscopy. 240 \n Conductivities, \u03c3 \/ S cm-1, are calculated as below: \nwhere t is the membrane thickness in cm (the values \ndetermined in section 2.2 at each RH were used), A is the \nelectrode area in cm2 and Rmem  \/ \u03a9 is the membrane \nresistance, at each RH, calculated from Rtot \u2013 Rcell. 245 \n3.

Nafion-115: Selected physical properties at 30\u00b0C \nThe values of WU, tinc, Ainc, \u03b8, \u03bb, and \u03c1 for all ionomers are \npresented in Fig. 1(a-d); the calculated values of IEC and [H+] \nare presented in Table 2. The thickness of Nafion-115 250 \ndecreased from 153 \u00b1 3 \u03bcm when fully hydrated to 148 \u00b1 3 \n\u03bcm at RH=100% and then further reduced to 121 \u00b1 3 \u03bcm at \nRH=0%; these values compare well with literature values (at \nroom temperature) of 149 \u00b1 9 \u03bcm when fully hydrated and \n124 \u00b1 2 \u03bcm when fully dehydrated.5 The thickness only 255 \nrecovered to 140 \u00b1 3 \u03bcm when re-hydrated at RH=100% \n(Table 3). This is consistent with current wisdom in that the \nionic cluster\/channel nanostructure of Nafion membranes can \nonly be re-formed on treatment in water at temperatures \naround 80\u00b0C;11 hence, re-hydrating at RH=100% and 30\u00b0C 260 \nfrom fully dehydrated will yield a membrane with intrinsically \ndifferent properties than a Nafion PEM that has been \nequilibrated at RH=100% directly from the fully hydrated, \nexpanded, form. \n This behaviour pattern is observed for Nafion for all of the 265 \nproperties investigated in this study. For example, the WU \nvalues decreased from 40 \u00b1 2 % when fully hydrated \n(literature value 39 \u00b1 2)5 to 29 \u00b1 2 at RH=100%, whilst the \nwater content, \u03bb, decreased from 24 \u00b1 2 water molecules per \nTable 2 The ion-exchange capacities and the concentration of conductive ion species for each ionomer at decreasing values of RH at 30\u00b0C. \n AAEM-F AAEM-E AAEM-C Nafion-115 \n 10\n3 x IECRH \n\/ mol(OH-) g-1 \n[OH-] \n\/ mol dm-3 \n103 x IECRH \n\/ mol(OH-) g-1 \n[OH-] \n\/ mol dm-3 \n103 x IECRH \n\/ mol(OH-) g-1 \n[OH-] \n\/ mol dm-3 \n103 x IECRH \n\/ mol(H+) g-1 \n[H+] \n\/ mol dm-3 \nFH 0.72 \u00b1 0.04 1.02 \u00b1 0.08 0.74 \u00b1 0.09 1.02 \u00b1 0.12 0.89 \u00b1 0.02 1.21 \u00b1 0.05 0.66 \u00b1 0.05 1.05 \u00b1 0.09 \nRH=100% 0.75 \u00b1 0.05 1.18 \u00b1 0.11 0.76 \u00b1 0.09 1.06 \u00b1 0.13 0.92 \u00b1 0.02 1.26 \u00b1 0.04 0.72 \u00b1 0.06 1.19 \u00b1 0.10 \nRH=91% 0.84 \u00b1 0.05 1.33 \u00b1 0.11 0.82 \u00b1 0.09 1.13 \u00b1 0.14 0.97 \u00b1 0.02 1.35 \u00b1 0.04 0.81 \u00b1 0.06 1.44 \u00b1 0.12 \nRH=75% 0.93 \u00b1 0.06 1.53 \u00b1 0.14 0.90 \u00b1 0.10 1.31 \u00b1 0.16 1.04 \u00b1 0.02 1.49 \u00b1 0.05 0.86 \u00b1 0.07 1.61 \u00b1 0.14 \nRH=52% 0.98 \u00b1 0.06 1.67 \u00b1 0.15 0.95 \u00b1 0.11 1.40 \u00b1 0.17 1.09 \u00b1 0.03 1.57 \u00b1 0.06 0.88 \u00b1 0.07 1.72 \u00b1 0.15 \nRH=33% 1.00 \u00b1 0.07 1.75 \u00b1 0.15 0.98 \u00b1 0.11 1.44 \u00b1 0.18 1.11 \u00b1 0.03 1.63 \u00b1 0.05 0.90 \u00b1 0.07 1.77 \u00b1 0.15 \nRH=0% 1.04 \u00b1 0.07 1.80 \u00b1 0.16 1.03 \u00b1 0.11 1.57 \u00b1 0.20 1.14 \u00b1 0.03 1.72 \u00b1 0.06 0.93 \u00b1 0.07 1.84 \u00b1 0.16 \nRehydrated at RH=100% 0.76 \u00b1 0.05 1.27 \u00b1 0.10 0.76 \u00b1 0.09 1.07 \u00b1 0.13 0.93 \u00b1 0.02 1.28 \u00b1 0.03 0.77 \u00b1 0.06 1.35 \u00b1 0.12  \n \n \nFig. 1 The effect of relative humidity (RH) at 30\u00b0C on selected physical properties (see Section 2.2) for Nafion-115 (\u25bc), AAEM-F (z), AAEM-E (\u008b), \nand AAEM-C (\u0084).

Nafion-115: Conductivities at 30\u00b0C \nThe values of \u03c3 observed as functions of RH and \u03bb are \npresented in Fig. 2(a-d). The first notable observation is that 285 \nthere is a significant decrease from \u03c3FH = 0.093 \u00b1 0.008 S cm-\n2 to \u03c3100% = 0.075 \u00b1 0.014 S cm-1, which is concomitant with \nthe decrease in \u03bb described in Section 3.1. The conductivity \nwas significantly reduced to less than 50% of the fully \nhydrated value when the RH was reduced to only 75%, whilst 290 \nthe conductivity collapsed to below 10-4 S cm-1 on full \ndehydration (as previously observed by Wintersgill et al.).12 \nFor confirmation that the conductivities measured in this \nstudy match those in the literature, a plot of \u03c3 vs. \u03bb was \ncompared with the empirical equation for Nafion-117 295 \ndeveloped by Springer et al.13 (Figure 2b) that has been \ngenerally verified in the literature:14 \n As can be seen there is a close match between this linear \nrelationship and the conductivities determined in this study; it \nis the author\u2019s view that this linear response is quite simplistic 300 \nfor such a complex material and electrochemical property. \nLiterature values for Nafion-117 of 0.06 S cm-1 for \u03bb = 14 at \n30\u00b0C14,15 and 0.105 S cm-1 at \u03bb = 218 at ambient temperatures \nact as further corroboration. An important consideration is \nthat Nafion-115 was the benchmark PEM in this study, whilst 305 \nmost literature values are for Nafion-117; there is increasing \nevidence in the literature that the conductivity of Nafion is a \nfunction of membrane thickness (as well as the equivalent \nweight as expected).5,16 On rehydration to RH=100%, the \nconductivity does not fully recover with some Nafion-115 310 \nsamples, whilst recovery is observed to be complete for other \nsamples (as can be seen from the large value of sample \nstandard deviation in Table 3); therefore no firm conclusions \nabout this can be made without additional measurements. \n3.3. AAEMs: Selected physical properties at 30\u00b0C 315 \nAll relevant properties are presented in Fig. 1 and Table 2 and \n3. As anticipated, the crosslinked AAEM-C exhibited lower \nlevels of water uptake and swelling at higher humidities than \nthe non-crosslinked AAEMs and Nafion-115 PEM as can be \nseen from the WU, \u03bb, t, tinc, Ainc, and \u03b8 measurements; this is a 320 \ndesirable trait as long as the added crosslinking does not \ndecrease membrane conductivity (see Section 3.4). Within \nmargins of error, the water uptake properties of AAEM-E, \nAAEM-F, and Nafion-115 cannot be clearly differentiated \nwhen submerged in water (fully hydrated forms). However, 325 \nAAEM-F and AAEM-E show a trend towards higher water \ncontent (\u03bb and WU) between RH=75 and RH=100% compared \nto Nafion-115. When fully hydrated, AAEM-F swells to a \nlarger degree than Nafion-115 in term of thickness (tinc) but to \na lesser extent in terms of area (Ainc) at higher humidities; as a 330 \nresult, the volume increase parameter \u03b8 is similar for both \nmembranes at RH=100% and when fully hydrated. The \nthickness increase parameter for AAEM-E is similar to \nNafion-115 when both are submerged in water but Ainc (and \ntherefore \u03b8) is considerably less. Therefore, all of the AAEMs 335 \nshow improved area-dimensional-stability compared to \nNafion-115 at the highest hydration levels. At intermediate \nhumidity levels, differences in Ainc, tinc and \u03b8 between the \nionomers are not discernible (within margins of error), with \nthe possible exception of greater area and volume increases 340 \nfor AAEM-E. \n As anticipated, the densities for all membranes increase on \ndehydration. Nafion-115 has the highest density as it is a \nsulfonated fully fluorinated membrane with no C-H bonds. \nThe AAEM-F is less dense: even though the precursor FEP is 345 \nfully fluorinated, the grafting of VBC and subsequent \namination introduces C-H bonds into the membrane. AAEM-\nE is less dense again as the ratio of C-H\/C-F bonds is further \nincreased (the ETFE precursor is only partially fluorinated). \nThe crosslinked AAEM-C exhibits similar densities (within 350 \nmeasurement precision) to AAEM-E indicating a comparable \nratio of C-H to C-F bonds. \n All three AAEMs studies show good recovery of their \nproperties on rehydration to RH=100% (Table 3); recovery of \nvolume and water content was significantly improved 355 \ncompared to Nafion-115. \nTable 3 The percentage of selected properties recovered on re-hydration \nat RH=100% for 7 days following full dehydration (RH=0%, 7 days) \nfrom an initial RH=100% humidified state. \n Xa = t \/ \u03bcm Xa = A \/ cm2 Xa = V \/ cm3 Xa = \u03bb Xa = \u03c3 \/ S cm-1 \nNafion-115 95 \u00b1 3 93 \u00b1 2 88 \u00b1 2 71 \u00b1 6 85 \u00b1 29 \nAAEM-F 96 \u00b1 7 97 \u00b1 2 93 \u00b1 2 94 \u00b1 5 89 \u00b1 8 \nAAEM-E 100 \u00b1 4 99 \u00b1 2 99 \u00b1 4 99 \u00b1 4 89 \u00b1 6 \nAAEM-C 99 \u00b1 2 99 \u00b1 1 98 \u00b1 1 95 \u00b1 3 82 \u00b1 7  \na ( )initalrehydrate XXX %,100%,100%100 \u00d7=  \n \n \n\u03c330\u00b0C = 0.005139 x \u03bb \u2013 0.00326      valid for \u03bb > 1 (11)\nCREATED USING THE RSC ARTICLE TEMPLATE (VER. 2.1) - SEE WWW.RSC.ORG\/ELECTRONICFILES FOR DETAILS \n \n6  |  [journal], [year], [vol], 00\u201300 This journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry [year] \n3.4. AAEMs: Conductivities at 30\u00b0C \nWhen comparing the relationships between conductivity and \nhumidity (Fig. 2), it is clear that all AAEMs behaved in a \nsimilar manner between RH=33 and RH=100% with AAEM-F 360 \nexhibiting the best conductivities in this intermediate \nhumidity range. However, as mentioned above, FEP-based \nAAEMs are physically brittle, unlike the ETFE analogues, and \ncannot currently be safely used in fuel cells.17 The \nconductivities of the AAEMs could not be determined at 365 \nRH=0% due to limitations in instrumentation (as described in \nSection 2.3). When immersed in water both AAEM-C and -E \nshowed significantly improved conductivities compared to \nAAEM-F (0.033 \u00b1 0.002, 0.030 \u00b1 0.005 and 0.017 \u00b1 0.001 S \ncm-1 respectively); these two low density AAEMs with 370 \nrestricted dimensional changes showed an impressive 32 \u2013 \n35% of the conductivity exhibited by Nafion-115 when fully \nhydrated. The unusual behaviour of the two low density \nAAEMs when fully hydrated can clearly be seen in the plot of \n\u03c330 vs. \u03bb (Fig. 2d); the sharp increase in conductivity when 375 \nfully hydrated is not seen for AAEM-F. This sharp increase \noccurs at lower water content for the crosslinked AAEM. \n Ion mobilities, \u03bc \/ m2 V-1 s-1, are related to both the \nconductivity and the concentration of the conductive species: \nwhere F is Faraday\u2019s constant (= 96,485.3 C mol-1). The ion 380 \nmobilities of OH- in the fully hydrated quaternary-\nammonium-based AAEM were between 18 and 33% of the \nmobilities of H+ in Nafion-115 (\u03bc = 9.2 x 10-8, 2.8 x 10-8, 3.1 \nx 10-8 and 1.7 x 10-8 m2 V-1 s-1 for Nafion, AAEM-C, AAEM-\nE and AAEM-F respectively). The lower conductivities in 385 \nthese solid ionomers is not due to a concentration effect as the \nconcentration of the conductive species for all ionomers are \nsimilar (Table 2). Hence, it has been established that the \nconductivities in these AAEMs are controlled by the ion \nmobilities; this is in line with diffusion coefficient arguments 390 \npresented by Agel et al.18 The OH- mobilities in the low \n \nFig. 2 The relationship between conductivity, relative humidity and ionomer water content for Nafion-115 (\u25bc), AAEM-F (z), AAEM-E (\u008b), and \nAAEM-C (\u0084).FH = fully hydrated and R = rehydrated after complete dehydration. %\u03c3FH,30 is the ratio of the conductivities at each RH compared to the \nconductivity at full hydration.

An \nammonium-type commercial anion-exchange membrane \n(AHA, Tokuyama, Japan: 240 \u03bcm in thickness in Cl- anion \nform, IEC = 1.15\u20131.25 x 10-3 mol(OH-) g-1) demonstrated a 400 \nconductivity of 0.01 S cm-1 (undisclosed temperature) when \nsubmerged in aqueous KOH (1 mol dm-3).19 Quaternary-\nammonium-containing 1,4-diazabicyclo[2,2,2]octane-\ncrosslinked epichlorhydrin AAEMs displayed conductivities \nof 0.01-0.05 S cm-1 at 25\u00b0C when submerged in aqueous KOH 405 \nsolutions of various concentrations between 0.1-7.2 mol dm-\n3.18 A quaternised cholomethylated polysulfone-Cardo AAEM \nexhibited a conductivity of 0.06 S cm-1 at 30\u00b0C when \nsubmerged in aqueous NaOH (1 mol dm-3).20 \n Another class of AAEM is the M+OH--doped polymer 410 \nelectrolyte. Savadogo et al. showed that conductivities as high \nas 0.1 S cm-1 at 90\u00b0C in aqueous KOH (> 1 mol dm-3) were \nachievable using a KOH-doped poly(benzimidazole) \nAAEM;21 this is not a metal-cation-free system (see Section \n3.6 for the importance of this). A conductivity of 0.0154 \u00b1 415 \n0.0018 S cm-1 was obtained for fully hydrated KOH-doped \nchitosan AAEMs;22 this is a rare example in the literature \nwhere the conductivity measurements were conducted with an \nAAEM that was not submerged in aqueous alkali solution. \nThe conductivity of this membrane collapsed to 10-7-10-8 S 420 \ncm-1 at RH=0%. An AAEM synthesised by doping a cross-\nlinked poly(vinylalcohol)-co-poly(acrylic acid) copolymer \nwith aqueous KOH (32 mass%) exhibited a high conductivity \nof 0.3 S cm-1 at 25\u00b0C.23 \n A final class of AAEM is based on ionomers containing 425 \npyridinium exchange sites. An example of this has been \nreported by Zhuang et al.;24 a conductivity of 0.008 S cm1 at \n25\u00b0C was obtained for a quaternised copolymer of 4-\nvinylpyridine and styrene. \n It is difficult to directly compare the AAEM conductivities 430 \ndetermined in this study to those in the literature as the vast \nmajority report conductivity data of AAEMs that were \nsubmerged in aqueous hydroxide salt solutions. The \nparticularly high conductivities of KOH doped \npolyelectrolytes is noted; the durability of this class of AAEM 435 \nin fuel cells, however, requires more thorough investigation \u2013 \nwould the incorporated KOH species remain in the ionomer \nwhen used in fuel cells where liquid water can be present? \nThe manifest lack of conductivity data to date regarding \nmetal-cation-free AAEMs clearly justifies the approach 440 \ndescribed in this article; this is especially true for data at \nreduced humidities. \n3.6. Implications for application of AAEMs in fuel cells \nThe low conductivities under reduced relative humidity \nconditions are evident from Fig. 3 (< 0.01 S cm-1 at RH < 445 \n91%). The conductivities of the AAEMs were more sensitive \nto humidity than Nafion-115 proton-exchange membrane. A \nkey requirement for the polymer electrolyte in H2\/air fuel cells \n(especially those for automotive power trains) is the ability to \nretain high ion conductivities at low humidities; humidifying 450 \nthe input gases adds significant complexity to the balance of \nplant and can consume a significant proportion of the energy \noutput of the cells. The utilisation of the AAEMs evaluated in \nthis study in H2\/air fuel cells supplied with low humidity gas \nsupplies will not be successful, unless the AAEMs are 455 \nfabricated sufficiently thin that the back transport of \nelectrogenerated water leads to significant ionomer water \nuptake. \n With respect to the anticipated application in fuel cells, it is \nimportant to recognise that the conductivity measurements in 460 \nthis study are ex situ. A recent in situ impedance spectroscopy \nstudy6 has been conducted where the commercial AAEM-C \ndescribed above was evaluated in a H2\/O2 fuel cell; this study \ndemonstrated that the in situ resistance of this AAEM with \nRH=100% gas supplies was on average only double that of 465 \nNafion-115 of similar thickness (rather than the three times \nmore resistive as predicted by the ex situ results presented in \nthis article). Remarkably, this study also showed that AAEM-\nC exhibited notable drops in resistance at high current \ndensities as water was electrogenerated at significant rates at 470 \nthe anode (2OH-(membrane) + H2(g) \u2192 2H2O(l\/g) + 2e-); this \nwater is then consumed at the cathode, after backtransport, as \na stoichiometric reactant (\u00bdO2(g) + H2O(l\/g) + 2e- \u2192 2OH-\n(membrane)). Hence, ex situ conductivity measurements under \nstatic atmospheric conditions, such as those presented in this 475 \nstudy, should only be considered as an initial guide to in situ \nionomer resistances (under dynamic conditions). \n Alkaline membranes can also be applied to direct alcohol \nfuel cells; recent studies have shown that in the specific \nabsence of metal cations, AAEMs can be operated in direct 480 \nmethanol fuel cells with < 95 \u03bcV h-1 cell voltage degradation \nrates;4 carbonation of the electrolyte (CO2 + 2OH- \u2192 CO32- + \nH2O) was minimal despite the electrogenerated CO2 at the \nanode and the inherent CO2 component of the air supply at the \ncathode. As this class of fuel cell is typically supplied with 485 \naqueous alcohol solutions at the anode, the issue of poor \nconductivity at low humidities is negated. The permeability of \nalcohols through the ionomer is now an important \nconsideration. AAEM-E and AAEM-C have been shown to \nexhibit significantly reduced methanol permeabilities 490 \ncompared to Nafion-115;17,6 this demonstrates the \napplicability of these membranes in direct alcohol fuel \ncells.3,17 A further advantage with using AAEMs in direct \nalcohol fuel cells arises when ethanol (a potentially carbon-\nneutral biofuel) is used as the fuel. Initial investigations in our 495 \nlaboratories indicate that the power density of a AAEM-based \ndirect ethanol fuel cell exceeded that of a directly comparable \ndirect methanol fuel cell containing the same AAEM. This is \nthe reverse of what is observed with Nafion-based direct \nalcohol fuel cells (less power is produced with ethanol than 500 \nwith methanol). In-depth investigations into this phenomenon \nhave now been initiated. \n The power densities of AAEM-based direct alcohol fuel \ncells is currently poor unless additional alkali metal hydroxide \nis added to the aqueous alcohol fuel supply; this is clearly 505 \nseen when comparing the performances of alkaline membrane \ndirect methanol fuel cells with25,26 and without3,17 the addition \nCREATED USING THE RSC ARTICLE TEMPLATE (VER. 2.1) - SEE WWW.RSC.ORG\/ELECTRONICFILES FOR DETAILS \n \n8  |  [journal], [year], [vol], 00\u201300 This journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry [year] \nof KOH into the methanol supply (cf. a peak power density of \n18 mW cm-2 at 60\u00b0C with KOH (1 mol dm-3) in aqueous \nmethanol (2 mol dm-3)25 and a peak power density of only 2 510 \nmW cm-2 at 60\u00b0C with KOH-free aqueous methanol (2 mol \ndm-3) and a lower resistance AAEM3). These poor \nperformances are due to the use of fuel cell electrode \narchitectures that have currently not been specifically \noptimised for solid alkaline fuel cells.6,17 515 \n3.7. Determination of empirical activation energies \nActivation energies, assuming Arrhenius behaviour, are \ncalculated from the slope, b, of the linear regression of ln (\u03c3 \/ \nS cm-1) vs (1000 \/ T) \/ K-1 plots: \nwhere R is the gas constant 8.314 J K-1 mol-1.1 The activation 520 \nenergies at RH=100% of AAEM-F, E, C, and Nafion-115 \nwere determined to be 15.1 \u00b1 0.8, 17.1 \u00b1 1.3, 18.9 \u00b1 2.1, and \n7.4 \u00b1 3.2 kJ mol-1 respectively by measuring the \nconductivities of these membranes at increasing temperatures \nbetween 30 and 60\u00b0C. A previous study observed that the 525 \nactivation energies for OH- conduction in fully hydrated FEP-\nbased AAEMs are more than twice that seen for H+ \nconduction in Nafion-115.1 \n Caution is required in determining the activation energies \nfor ion conduction in ionomers at lower humidities when 530 \nusing constant humidity (saturated salt) solutions. This is \nbecause the humidity above such salt solutions is a function of \ntemperature (this function varies with salt species). Sudden \nchanges in temperature will also cause transient drops in \nhumidity as the atmosphere above the solutions heat up faster 535 \nthan the solutions themselves, which could cause some \nadditional ionomer dehydration. Hence only tentative \nestimations of activation energies are reported. As expected, \nthe activation energies of all ionomers increased at lowered \nhumidities (ionic transport is restricted with reduced water 540 \ncontents). In the range RH=33 \u2013 52%, activation energies of \n21 \u2013 32 kJ mol-1 were observed for the AAEMs and 7 \u2013 13 kJ \nmol-1 were observed for Nafion-115. A better experimental \nmethodology is clearly required; a new cell for future \nconductivity studies with flowing nitrogen of controlled 545 \nhumidity is therefore being designed in order that more \naccurate determinations of activation energies at low RH can \nbe achieved. \nConclusions \nThe ETFE-based alkaline anion-exchange membrane (AAEM) 550 \nexhibited reduced physical swelling than both FEP-based \nAAEMs and Nafion-115 proton-exchange membrane at 30\u00b0C \nwhen fully hydrated; this is desirable for application in \npolymer-based low temperature fuel cells. The normal \n(through membrane) OH- conductivity of this AAEM was 555 \n0.030 \u00b1 0.005 S cm-1 when fully hydrated (i.e. 32% of the H+ \nconductivity of Nafion); this represents an impressive level of \nconductivity for a solid alkaline ionomer with no additional \nincorporation of metal hydroxide species. A commercial \nAAEM containing additional crosslinking reduces the water 560 \ncontents and swelling further with no detrimental loss of ionic \nconductivity at full hydration. Unfortunately, all the AAEMs \nexhibited substantially lowered conductivities at lower \nrelative humidities; this is undesirable for the anticipated \napplication in alkaline membrane fuel cells where operation 565 \nwith low humidity gases is considered necessary; the case for \ndevelopment of AAEMs with conductivities that are less \nsensitive to humidity is therefore highlighted. Recovery of the \nphysical properties on subsequent rehydration, after full \ndehydration, was superior for all the AAEMs compared to that 570 \nfor Nafion-115. \nAcknowledgements \nThe author thanks the U.K.\u2019s Engineering and Physical \nSciences Research Council for funding (Grant \nGR\/S60709\/01), Keith Lovell (Department of Materials and 575 \nMedical Sciences, Cranfield University, Shrivenham) for \u03b3-\nray irradiation, and Prof. Robert Slade (Department of \nChemistry, University of Surrey) for in-depth discussions. \nReferences \n1 R.
