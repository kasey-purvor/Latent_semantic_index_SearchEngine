This offers many \nchallenges: \n for researchers in understanding the complexes processes which underlie this \nsusceptibility;  \n for clinicians seeking to prevent or delay the progression of CKD in an \nindividual patient, and optimising renal replacement therapy [RRT] when this is \nunavoidable,; \n for those responsible for organising, delivering and meeting the cost of the \nincreased demands for RRT in areas serving minority populations.   \nWhile it is pragmatically necessary to make broad categories of ethnicity to purposes \nof  epidemiology and clinical research in this field, it is also important to appreciate \nthat within any grouping such as African or South Asian are populations with \nenormous variety of culture, religion, education, and socio-economic circumstances \nwhich makes complex  the interpretation of causal relationships. \nEpidemiology \n Migration of   populations across the world continues to increase. This has \nled to an increasing variety of ethnic minority populations in many countries, some of \nwhich also have minority indigenous populations.  Minority populations are often \ngeographically localised. For example, ethnic minorities are 9% of the UK \n  \n4 \npopulation, but in the city of Leicester, the population originating from South Asia \nhas rapidly increased to more than 50% of those living within the city boundary.  \nSuch minority populations present challenges to health care.  Even if they had no \nvariations in disease prevalence, substantial language and cultural variations can \nprovide additional demands on the health care system, and these are most difficult in \nlong term conditions such as CKD. But in fact, there are many disease variations in \nminority populations, not least an increased incidence of type 2 diabetes and \nprogressive CKD.  Furthermore recent migrant populations typically have a younger \nage distribution than the indigenous population, so that diseases such as CKD, which \nincrease in incidence with increasing age, will at first be underrepresented compared \nto the eventual population burden as the minority population ages. \nThe incidence of CKD is increased in many ethnic minority populations. \nThere a is three-  to fourfold increase in the incidence of end-stage renal disease \n(ESRD) in South Asian and African Caribbean populations in the UK [1], and there \nare similar increases in African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans in the \nUS [2].  Other populations at increased risk include Aborigines, Maoris, and Pacific \nIslanders in Australasia.  Most studies have used the onset of ESRD and acceptance \nfor RRT as a means of case ascertainment, but this approach might underestimate the \ntrue incidence if patients have inequity of access to RRT. It is common to emphasize \nthe increased susceptibility to ESRD in these ethnic minority populations; but \nperhaps we should instead consider that the white European population seems \nuniquely at low risk of renal disease.  This decreased risk could have a genetic basis, \nor may reflect environmental factors, such as the very gradual urbanization in most \n  \n5 \nCaucasian European populations compared to the very rapid   recent urbanization in \nmany developing countries.  \nIn more homogeneous populations, the incidence of ESRD is even more \nstrikingly increased. While the Pima Indians have a specific susceptibility to diabetic \nnephropathy [3], Native Americans of the Zuni Pueblo tribe--with an incidence of \nESRD 18 times that of white Americans--have a broader susceptibility to CKD \nincluding diabetic nephropathy and glomerulonephritis [4]. The Aboriginal \npopulation in Tiwi Island, Northern Territory, where obesity and type 2 diabetes are \nendemic, has an ESRD incidence more than 2000\/million population\/year; \ncomprising only 26% of the population of Northern Territory, Aborigines are 96% of \nthose on RRT [5]. \n  All these ethnic minority populations at increased risk of CKD share a \nmarked increase in susceptibility to type 2 diabetes and an increased susceptibility \namong diabetics to ESRD. For example, data from Leicester, UK indicated a 13-fold \nincrease in the risk of a South Asian diabetic developing ESRD compared to a white \ndiabetic [6], the Pima Indians have a risk of ESRD 14 times that of the white US \ndiabetic population [7], and there is also a marked increase in African American type \n2 diabetics compared to whites.  In many populations severe hypertension adds   risk \nfor ESRD. Current predictions suggest an increase in the prevalence of type 2 \ndiabetes of at least 30%   above current levels by the year 2025 in developed \ncountries, but two- to threefold increases in prevalence in developing countries \nduring the same period [8].  This predicted epidemic of ESRD in people with \ndiabetes will be uncontainable unless effective preventive strategies are developed.  \n  \n6 \n Studies using requirement for RRT for case ascertainment will not \ndistinguish susceptibility to the development of renal disease from an increased risk \nof progression to ESRD once nephropathy is established.  In hypertensive blacks, \nthere is long-established evidence of increased progression risk despite equivalent \nblood pressure control [9]. In CKD of other etiologies, evidence increasingly points \nto the increased risk of progression as the predominant explanation for increased \nESRD.  A US birth cohort analysis showed no difference between blacks and whites \nin the prevalence of CKD, yet five years later in the same cohort, a near fivefold \nincreased risk of ESRD among the blacks was apparent [10].  Recent UK data also \nshow no difference in the prevalence of early CKD between White and South Asian \npopulations despite the marked excess of ESRD in South Asians. \n \nPathogenesis \nGenetic susceptibility to renal diseases and their progression, susceptibility \nprovoked by environmental factors, susceptibility induced by the effects of fetal \nenvironment, and socioeconomic influences all can contribute to susceptibility to \nCKD in ethnic minority populations [11].  \nOne particular challenge is separating the influence of ethnicity from that of \nsocio-economic disadvantage, two major factors which so often co-segregate. \nSocioeconomic disadvantage is itself associated with increased risk of ESRD [12], a \ncomplex interaction that might directly influence renal damage, be associated with \ndamaging health behaviours, or influence the quality of health care of those with \nkidney disease. \n  \n7 \n \nPreventing progression to ESRD \nThere is much work needed to unravel the contributions of these various \npathogenic mechanisms, but in the meantime there are opportunities to prevent CKD \nin high risk populations, and to detect CKD early, intervening to delay its \nprogression. If such opportunities are grasped, they may not only benefit the \nindividual, but offer significant health system economies if they avoid the cost of \nRRT, and of course are critically important in health economies where RRT is \nunavailable or unaffordable. \nBut such opportunities to turn the tide of ESRD will not be grasped if those \nat risk are not engaged by the healthcare system nor are responsive to our \nrecommendations. Minority populations may lack the awareness or health education \nto engage, and programmes which approach these problems must be designed with \ncultural sensitivity.   \nIn the US, considerable evidence points to blacks having inferior access to \nhealth care.  Blacks report receiving less information about health care and express \nmore dissatisfaction with treatment [13]. Fewer black hypertensive patients have \ntheir blood pressure checked at least annually. These differences are reported at all \nincome levels, although blood pressure control might be more unsatisfactory among \nblacks living in inner cities [14]. The only similar study in the UK shows a more \nreassuring trend for earlier referral of blacks with CKD compared to whites. [15]. \n Outcome of renal replacement therapy in ethnic minority populations \n  \n8 \nIn healthcare settings where RRT is available, it is important that RRT be delivered \nwith equity in ethnic minority populations. Proper assessment of equity   requires \nevaluation of mortality, morbidity, and quality of life, if care is to be optimised.   \nIn the US, mortality in patients receiving RRT (adjusted for socio-economic factors \nand comorbidity), is consistently lower in ethnic minorities [16].     The UK Renal \nRegistry reports a significant reduction in one-year mortality for Blacks and South \nAsians on RRT [17].   In Hong Kong, survival of Chinese patients undergoing \nperitoneal dialysis (PD) is significantly better than that reported in other large PD \nstudies involving predominantly white populations [18].  The reasons for these \ndiscrepant outcomes are likely to be complex; ethnicity itself might not be the \nexplanation, and many other factors might introduce bias. For example, 80% of all \ndialysis patients in Hong Kong are undergoing PD compared to the predominance of \nHD in the US. A low patient acceptance also might alter the case mix; only 54% of \nHong Kong Chinese identified as suitable for PD agreed to receive the treatment \n[19]. A low transplantation rate, as in Hong Kong, also might lead to younger, fitter \npatients remaining on PD, thus improving the cohort outcome.     The improved \nsurvival may also reflect survival advantage; the highest risk individuals having not \nsurvived to commence RRT. \n Improved survival on haemodialysis is found in African Americans despite \nother factors expected to reduce survival including non-adherence with treatment \nregimens,   increased use of dialysis catheters, and higher requirements for \nerythropoietin [20]. \nRenal Transplantation     \n  \n9 \n Registry data from several parts of the world including the UK and the US \nshow lower rates of transplantation in ethnic minorities which may represent inequity \nof access. Ethnic minorities are overrepresented in dialysis programs but less likely \nto be listed for deceased donor transplantation, wait longer, and are less likely \nactually to be transplanted [21]. Ethnic minority populations are more likely to \nreceive poorly matched kidneys, since they are under-represented among deceased \ndonors. Graft survival is also reduced in minorities in the US, and in both Blacks and \nSouth Asians in the UK [21, 22].  But the most disadvantaged patients of course are \neligible patients who are never transplanted, whether with a deceased donor or living \ndonor kidney. \n Promotion of living donor transplantation is a key element in strategies for \nminimizing inequity of access to transplantation.  A study from Baltimore, USA \nshowed that a decade of active encouragement of volunteerism led to the same living \ndonor transplant rate in blacks as whites, with equivalent patient and graft survival, \nand median waiting times below the national average [23]. Innovative approaches to \nliving donor transplantation, for example, strategies aimed at transplanting across \nABO incompatibility barriers, also might assume special importance. US physicians \nwhen asked why ethnic minority patients were referred less frequently for \ntransplantation most commonly cited the lack of a potential  live donor, patient \npreference, co-morbidity, or concern that patients did not complete necessary \nevaluations [24].  While living donor transplantation is the optimal RRT for many \npatients, donor selection needs special care in populations which have typically have \na high incidence of familial renal disease.  \n  \n10 \nThe shortage of deceased donors from ethnic minority populations is a continuing \nconcern. In the UK, South Asians and Blacks only contribute 1.5% of the total donor \npool yet comprise 6% of the general population and 19% of patients on the deceased \ndonor transplant waiting list. The reasons underlying this shortfall have been \nextensively explored with these communities, and programs are in place to improve \ndonor rates through awareness and education, although progress is slow. \nAn adverse effect of the relative difficulties in identifying appropriate deceased \ndonors for minority populations has been the surge of \u2018transplant tourism\u2019 for those  \nwith resources to \u2018buy\u2019 a living unrelated donor kidney, a practice condemned by the \ninternational renal community through the  Istanbul Declaration [25] .     \n \nQuality of life on renal replacement therapy \n \n  Tools for the evaluation of health-related quality of life are available for \nrenal disease.  However, these have typically been developed and tested in majority \npopulations, and might not be sensitive to the cultural, religious, and social \ndistinctions in ethnic minorities.  Important differences also might emerge when \nquestionnaire-based quality-of-life assessment relies on the use of health \nprofessionals, interpreters, and family members.  These potential biases will not be \ninfrequent, even in stable migrant populations, in which older people do not read or \nwrite in English or even in their native language.  \nNevertheless, South Asians in the UK reported inferior quality of life \ncompared to whites both on peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis, and following renal \n  \n11 \ntransplantation [26]. However, health-related quality of life in the Dialysis Outcomes \nand Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS) was higher in ethnic minority patients [27]. \nThe prominence of religious belief as a coping mechanism has been suggested as a \npossible explanation for this finding  [28]; alternatively, in the US health care setting, \na narrowing of the gap in access to good quality health care after the initiation of \nRRT might alter perception of quality of life.   \n \nPublic health implications \nAlthough exploration of the mechanisms that underlie susceptibility to renal \ndisease in these populations is of the utmost importance for the future, there is a \npressing worldwide health care challenge that will accelerate at a pace faster than \nfundamental research can head off.  In the UK, the overall age-adjusted relative risk \nremains more than threefold in both the South Asian and African Caribbean \npopulations, and this risk might be increasing. The younger age distribution of the \nethnic minority population means even larger future increases in the demand for \nRRT. Estimates of need are based on the presumption that current acceptance rates \nare a true reflection of demand; this might not be the case if there is inequity of \naccess to health care.   Vigorous advocacy must continue if resources sufficient to \ndeliver the required standards of care are to be made available where populations \ninclude large ethnic minorities. Indeed it must be recognised that the delivery of \nhigh-quality health care that is linguistically and culturally adequate for ethnic \nminorities will likely require additional resources compared to the resources needed \nfor majority populations.  Although intensive efforts at augmenting transplantation \n  \n12 \nrates from both deceased and living donors must continue, a disproportionate \nrequirement for dialysis facilities is unavoidable.  In parallel, programmes for \nscreening and early intervention must be introduced if the future RRT burden is to be \nrestrained [29]. Priority also must be given to the long-term goals of understanding \ngenetic and other factors influencing the susceptibility of ethnic populations to CKD \nif truly effective preventative strategies are to be achieved. \n  \n  \n  \n13 \nREFERENCES \n \n \n1.
