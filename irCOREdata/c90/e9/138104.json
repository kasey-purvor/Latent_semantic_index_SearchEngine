Introduction \nAdvanced composites using Non Crimp Fabrics (NCF) and Liquid Composite Moulding (LCM) \ntechnologies are becoming increasingly attractive to the automotive (and other) industries for the \neconomical manufacture of high performance parts in small series production runs. The absence of \ncrimp gives high specific stiffness and strength, and biaxial NCF textile forms offer excellent \ndrapeability for the manufacture of complex shapes. However, predictive failure models for these \ncomposites, suitable for impact and crash analysis, which can also account for fabric preshear, is \nrequired.  \n \nThe potential intra-laminar failure modes of biaxial NCF are failure in one of the two fibre directions; \neither in tension or compression, and intra-laminar shear failure leading to fibre-matrix debonding. \nLamina transverse matrix failure might also be observed; however, this mode will not initiate \ncatastrophic ply failure since loading will be effectively transferred by the orthogonal tows of the \nadjacent plies. This is an observation recognised by Hart-Smith [1] in failure criteria he developed for \n 3 \nUnidirectional (UD) cross plies composites. A further possible composite failure mode is ply \ndelamination; which has been investigated in a previous publication by the authors [16]. This failure \nmode is not considered here. \n \nThe excellent drapeability of NCF\u2019s allows both single and complex double curvature shapes to be \nformed, Figure 1. The shaping operation may cause extensive fabric shearing which will significantly \nmodify local composite stiffness and strength properties. In excessively sheared areas fibre alignment \nwill enhance strength in the fibre directions and render the composite vulnerable to failure under \ncombined tension-shear loading in the transverse direction, Figure 1. For the work presented here a \n\u00b145\u00b0 biaxial NCF having the specifications shown in Table 1 is used. \n \nDuring the past three decades many composites failure models have been proposed and several have \nfound their way into commercial Finite Element (FE) codes for prediction of ply failure. A recent \ncomprehensive study to evaluate the most promising of these has been presented [2]. From this study \nthe \u2018Puck\u2019 model [3] was highly rated and has been considered \u201cto be the best at capturing the \nqualitative characteristics of lamina and laminate behaviour\u201d [4]. However, it was noted that this \ntheory neglected inelastic material deformations which led to significant underestimation of strains for \nmatrix dominated load cases. A further noteworthy contribution to this study was by Cuntze [5] who, \nin many respects used a similar model to \u2018Puck\u2019 [6], but also accounted for matrix plasticity. \n \nThe constitutive model proposed by Ladev\u00e8ze and Le Dantec [7] allows representation of matrix \nplasticity, combined with matrix damage; thus providing an improved basis for prediction of the \nstress-strain relation of the material. This paper presents a combination of the \u2018Ladev\u00e8ze\u2019 model and \nthe \u2018Puck\u2019 failure criteria to treat in-plane failure of carbon NCF reinforced composites under \ncombined loading conditions; further improvements for representation of matrix shear damage \ndevelopment in NCF composites have also been necessary. The next section introduces the failure \nmodels, followed by sections on parameter identification and validation. Both unsheared and pre-\nsheared fabric composites have been considered in the experimental and numerical work. It is believed \nthat the techniques presented are, in principle, also applicable to other biaxial textile reinforced \ncomposites such as conventional woven fabrics. \n \n2. Material Modelling \n2.1. The damage constitutive model \nThe classical continuum damage mechanics model proposed by Ladev\u00e8ze and Le Dantec has been \nimplemented in a multi-layered thin shell element in the explicit Finite Element code PAM-CRASHTM \n 4 \n[8]. This allows each ply in the laminate to be represented using an orthotropic elasto-plastic, with \ndamage, stress-strain relationship given by, \n{ } [ ]{ }e\u03b5C\u03c3 =  . (2-1) \nThe stress and strain vectors are, \n{ } { }TT 3123122211 \u03c3\u03c3\u03c3\u03c3\u03c3\u03c3 = , \nand \n{ } { }TeeeeeTe 3123212211 \u03b5\u03b5\u03b5\u03b5\u03b5=\u03b5 , \nand the stiffness matrix [C] has the following form and coefficients, \n[ ]\n( )\n( )\n( )\n( )\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ee\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n=\n12\n0\n12\n12\n0\n23\n12\n0\n12\n22\n0\n22\n0\n11\n0\n21\n0\n11\n0\n21\n0\n11\n10000\n01000\n00100\n0001\n000\ndG\ndG\ndG\ndCC\nCC\n\u03c5\n\u03c5\nC , (2-2) \nwith \n0\n21\n0\n12\n0\n110\n11 1 \u03c5\u03c5\u2212\n=\nE\nC  ; 0\n21\n0\n12\n0\n220\n22 1 \u03c5\u03c5\u2212\n=\nE\nC .  \nIn the above equations the material constants 011E  and \n0\n22E are elastic modulii in the fibre and \ntransverse directions, 0ijG  is shear modulus, and \n0\nij\u03c5  is Poisson\u2019s ratio. The matrix dominated elastic \nmodulii, E220, G120, and G230, are modified by the damage functions (1-dij) during loading to failure. \nTwo scalar damage functions d22 and d12 are introduced, having the range 0 (no damage) to 1.0 (fully \ndamaged) to describe matrix damage development in the ply transverse and shear directions, \nrespectively. Some simplifications for numerical implementation are made for out-of plane shear \nmodulii. Based on the assumption of transverse isotropy, the shear modulus in the 1-2 and 1-3 \ndirections are considered equal, G130 = G120. Consequently, equal damage development in both \ndirections is assumed, d13 = d12. For the sake of simplicity shear damage in the 2-3 direction is related \nto in-plane shear damage development, d23 = d12. The theory assumes constant Poisson\u2019s ratio \ncoefficients. \n \nThe damage functions (d22 and d12) are associated with conjugate quantities Y22 and Y12, which govern \ndamage development. These quantities are partial derivatives of damaged elastic work with respect to \nthe damage state and are analogous to the strain energy release rate Gic used in classical Fracture \nMechanics to describe strain energy released during crack growth [7].

(2-5) \n \nDamage development under matrix transverse compression loading is prohibited, equation (2-4), due \nto the assumption that existing matrix micro-cracks will close under compression loading, in which \ncase the initial transverse elastic modulus is recovered. Damage interaction is introduced by the \nparameter b , leading to the final governing equation for coupled transverse-shear damage, \n( ) ( ) ( )( )\u03c4\u03c4\u03c4 2212sup bYYtY t += \u2264 . (2-6) \nGenerally the coupling factor b is determined from experiments.  \n \nEnhancements to shear damage representation for NCF \nA lamina under pure in-plane intra-laminar shear loading will exhibit matrix micro-cracks after a \ncertain threshold stress is exceeded Figure 2a. These cracks will be normal to the direction of first \nprincipal stress and will extend until stopped by fibres crossing the crack paths. Continued loading will \ngenerate new parallel cracks, Figure 2b, until a saturated level of matrix micro-cracks is reached, \nFigure 2c. Further loading will cause micro-cracks to coalescence and form a macro-crack leading to \nmaterial fracture Figure 2d. Based on these micro-mechanical considerations a corresponding macro-\nmechanical shear damaging law is proposed to approximate the real physical behaviour of the \ninvestigated NCF composite. An exponential shear damage function is used, in which the damage state \nasymptotically approaches the level of saturated damage, Figure 2e. Similar nonlinear shear damage \ndevelopment has also been observed and used for woven fabric pre-preg composites [9] and biaxial \nbraid composites [10]. In the nonlinear shear damage function, Figure 2, 012Y  represents the initiation \nof shear damage, fitY12  is a fitting parameter for the shape of the shear damage evolution curve, and \nSatd  represents the saturation damage level.  \n \nMatrix plasticity \nA cyclic tensile coupon test of a [\u00b145]2s laminate is used to characterise evolution of matrix shear \ndamage and plasticity. The global laminate stresses and strains are transformed to assess the local ply \nshear stress-strain curve, Figure 3. The degradation of the ply shear modulus G12,i and the generation \nof inelastic ply deformation p i,12\u03b3  can be clearly observed. \n \nFor NCF the plasticity model proposed by Ladev\u00e8ze and Le Dantec for UD composites [7] has been \nfound appropriate and is used here. Briefly, this is simple Von Mises yield criteria using an associated \n 6 \nflow rule to monitor the evolution of permanent plastic strains in the matrix caused by the transverse \nand shear strain components, \n( ) 0~~ 222212 =\u2212+= pRaf \u03c3\u03c3 , (2-7) \nwith the effective stresses, \nij\nij\nij d\n\u03c3\n\u2212\n=\n1\n~ \u03c3 . (2-8) \nFactor 2a  can account for material anisotropy. Assuming an isotropic matrix material it can be shown \nfrom the \u2018von Mises\u2019 yield condition that 312 =a .  \n \nA power law is assumed for plastic strain hardening, \nR(p) = Ro+\u03b2 pm, (2-9) \nwhere R0 is the shear yield stress, \u03b2 and m are curve fitting parameters. The equivalent plastic strain p \nis given by, \n( )\u222b \u2212= pddp 12121 \u03b3 , (2-10) \nwhere the plastic shear strain increment pd 12\u03b3  is the difference between the total and elastic shear \nstrain increments, \netp ddd 121212 \u03b3\u03b3\u03b3 \u2212= . (2-11) \n \nMaterial parameter identification \nThe shear damage development and plastic hardening curve are determined by quasi-static cyclic \ntensile testing of [\u00b145]2s NCF composite coupons to failure, Figure 4. A rate of loading of 0.5 mm\/min \nin an Instron 5500R-6025 testing machine has been used. The parameter identification for shear \nfollows the procedures outlined in [7] with the new exponential shear damage function. Figure 5a,b \nshows the good fit of damage and hardening functions to experimental data points. For this work the \nexponential shear damage function has been implemented and used in a research version of the FE \ncode PAMCRASHTM.  \n \nThe calibrated model parameters are summarised in Appendix I. Simulation of the cyclic tensile test \nusing the new exponential damage function yields very good agreement with the experimental results, \nas shown by comparison of the longitudinal stress-strain curves in Figure 5c. Another simulation \ncurve, computed using the original linear damaging function, is included for comparison. The linear \ndamage approach leads to higher stresses at the beginning due to the underestimation of the damage \nstate, Figure 5a. Furthermore, premature specimen failure is observed in this simulation once \ndamaging localises and approaches the limiting value 1.0. \n \n 7 \nThe original \u2018Ladev\u00e8ze\u2019 model allows coupling of transverse tension damage and shear damage; b \u2260 0 \nin equation (2-6). However, since carbon\/epoxy biaxial NCF composites exhibit brittle elastic \ntransverse tensile failure without significant damaging it is assumed that transverse deformation does \nnot contribute to shear damage development; thus shear damage development is solely governed by \nshear deformation; 0\u2192b . \n \n2.2. The Intra-laminar failure model \nFibre dominated failure: The elastic lamina modulii in the fibre direction ( ctE ,11 ) and the \ncorresponding maximum elastic strains ( max,11 ct\u03b5 ) have been obtained using standard tension and \ncompression tests of [0\/90]2s NCF coupons according to ASTM standards [11] and [12], Figure 6. The \nmaterial model parameters obtained from these tests are summarised in Appendix I. \n \nMatrix dominated failure: The in-plane intra-laminar matrix failure envelope proposed by Puck for a \nunidirectional lamina is represented by three different inter-connected curve functions, each \nrepresenting a distinct failure mode A, B, and C, as shown in Figure 7. \n \nThe original \u2018Ladev\u00e8ze\u2019 model contains a failure criterion for matrix failure which is directly related \nthe to damage development [7]. As previously mentioned, only shear damage is assumed to be active \noccur under transverse compression loading, giving an open matrix failure envelope in the transverse \ncompression direction, Figure 8. This is felt to be inappropriate for the NCF composite investigated \nhere; although it is noted that recent work by Ladev\u00e8ze et al. [13], has enhanced this failure mode to \ninclude transverse compression. In this work, however, the established \u2018Puck\u2019 failure criterion is \npreferred, so that matrix damage development and the matrix failure criterion are completely \nuncoupled.  \n \nFor numerical integration of the Puck matrix failure criterion into an FE code it is convenient to use a \nscaling distance \u03bb,  defined as the ratio of the current stress vector {\u03c3} to the extrapolated vector at the \nfailure envelope {\u03c3fail}, Figure 8, such that, \n{ } { }fail\u03c3\u03c3 \u03bb= , \nwith \n(2-12) \n\uf8f4\uf8f3\n\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f1\n\u2212>\n<\n=\nfailurepost\nfailure\nfailureno\n1\n1\n1\n\u03bb\n. \n(2-13) \nBased on the equations for matrix failure [14] the maximum \u03bb for the different failure modes follows \nas, \n 8 \n( )\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n\u2264\u2264<\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n\u2264\u2264<\n\u2265\n=\n\u22a5\u22a5\n\u22a5\u22a5\nc\nA\nModeC\nc\nA\nModeB\nModeA\nRandif\nRandif\nif\n1222\n12\n22\n1212\n22\n22\n22\n00\n00\n0\n\u03c3\u03c3\n\u03c3\n\u03c3\u03bb\n\u03c3\u03c3\n\u03c3\n\u03c3\u03bb\n\u03c3\u03bb\n\u03bb .

Testing coupons were manufactured from dry orthotropic biaxial NCF which were \nmanually pre-sheared from \u00b145\u00b0 to \u00b1\u03c6\u00b0 and stacked in a sequence of [\u00b1\u03c6]2s prior to Vacuum Assisted \nResin Infusion (VARI). The coupons were then cut from the manufactured panels, providing different \nlay-up\u2019s ([\u00b1\u03c6]2s, [\u00b1(90-\u03c6)]2s, and [0\/2\u03c6]2s) as indicated in Figure 9a. Two different pre-sheared \ncomposites were investigated; the first representing moderate fabric pre-shear (\u03c6 = 35\u00b0) and the \nsecond representing greater pre-shear (\u03c6 = 28\u00b0). The laminate thickness has been increased according \nto the amount of pre-shear in order to keep the fibre volume ratio approximately constant at Vf = 0.48 \nthroughout the test programme. \n \n 9 \nFlat coupons were used for tension and compression testing using the procedures in [11] and [12] \nrespectively, Figure 9b,c. All specimens were tested quasi-statically at 0.5 mm\/min to failure in an \nInstron 5500R-6025 testing machine. The full testing programme undertaken is summarised in Figure \n9d. Specimens tested in the fibre directions used monotonic loading to failure in tension and \ncompression. The remaining specimens, [\u00b1\u03c6]2s and [\u00b1(90-\u03c6)]2s, were tested using cyclic tension \nloading to failure in order to determine damage evolution and plasticity prior to failure. Table 1 \nsummarises all results for fibre (tension and compression), and the cyclic shear failure cases. \n \nTest results show an extensive nonlinear inelastic response for the [\u00b128]2s and [\u00b135]2s symmetric \ncyclic tension test coupons. Tension testing of the [\u00b155]2s and [\u00b162]2s coupons leads to a more linear \nelastic longitudinal stress-strain relation, according to an increased contribution of elastic transverse \nloading in these cases. Specimens loaded in the fibre direction, [0\/2\u03c6]2s, generally exhibit brittle elastic \nfailure under both tension and compression loading. For all these tensile tests it is noted that only \nminor experimental scatter is observed. \n \nAn inverse approach is used for the calibration of the matrix failure envelope. The procedure is \nvisualised in Figure 10, and explained below. \n \nThe [\u00b1\u03d5]2s and [\u00b1(90-\u03d5)]2s tension tests are modelled using multi-layered shell Finite Elements in \nPAM-CRASHTM, and simulated in order to determine the material model parameters for the matrix \nfailure envelope. The simulations are stopped at the point of failure according to the maximum \nobserved experimental longitudinal strain and stress traces (\u03c312 versus) of a ply element within the \nfailure zone of each simulated test case are collected on to one chart, Figure 11. Within some \nsimulations structural failure is initiated by fibre failure (denoted by square symbol in Figure 11). The \nremaining (circular) end points of the stress traces are used to \u2018fit\u2019 the \u2018Puck\u2019 failure envelope. Thus \nthe puck failure envelope obtained is valid for all unsheared and pre-sheared NCF composites tested. \nThe basic strength (\u03c322 for an individual ply) in transverse tension and compression direction cannot be \ndetermined from the biaxial NCF composite. Hence, these strengths have been estimated from tests on \na unidirectional NCF having similar carbon\/epoxy systems. \n \nThe material model parameters determined are summarised in Appendix I. For confirmation of this \ninverse material model parameter identification procedure, simulations of all test cases were repeated \nusing the matrix failure model parameters identified. The computed stress-strain curves to failure are \nin good agreement with the experiments, Table 2. \n \n 10 \n3. Validation of Simulation Methodologies: Transversely Loaded Composite Discs \nThe previous section has outlined the test and material parameter identification procedures used to \ndetermine failure data for unsheared and pre-sheared NCF composites. This section describes a test \nthat has been devised to validate the material models and material parameters.  \n \nThe test involves circular composite discs of 120mm diameter which are simply supported on their \nperimeter and quasi-statically loaded transversely at their centre with a rigid hemispherical punch of \n25mm or 50mm diameter. The discs rest on a slightly bevelled (15\u00b0) ring and are constrained by three \nconcentric pins, Figure 12, to provide the simple support condition. The test setup was specially \ndesigned to realise rotational symmetry and minimise bearing effects on the boundary. The loading \nrate  to failure was 0.5mm\/min in an Instron 5500R-6025 testing machine. Different lay-ups, including \nunsheared and pre-sheared NCF, were used in this validation exercise. \n \nDisc Manufacture and Testing: Flat panels of NCF composite were manufactured using the VARI \nprocess having lay-ups of [0\/90\/\u00b145]s, [\u00b145]2s, [\u00b138\/\u00b152]s, and [\u00b135]2s. The lay-up\u2019s [\u00b138\/\u00b152]s and \n[\u00b135]2s were generated by manually shearing \u00b145\u00b0 biaxial fabrics. The circular discs were then cut \nfrom the finished panels and prepared for testing, Table 3. The punch force-displacement curves \nobtained from testing are summarised in Figure 13 and Figure 14. \n \nAll tests display a gradually increasing force until first structural failure. The 50mm diameter punch \nspecimens tend to exhibit failure by a sudden crack developing between the punch and the outer rim of \nthe disc, which leads to a rapid drop in force. The post failure force response displays significant \nresidual strength after first structural failure since the large punch allows force redistribution away \nfrom the damage area beneath the punch. The smaller punch creates greater confined local damage as \nit penetrates the disc. Figure 15 shows typical final deformations of the composite discs after \ntransverse loading by the large and the small punch. Only minor scatter is observed for tests using the \nlarger punch, whereas more variation is found for the force-displacement curves of the smaller punch \nspecimens. Most scatter is observed in the pre-sheared [\u00b138\/\u00b152]s specimens. \n \nSimulation of the Disc Tests: The composite discs have been modelled using an average element \nlength beneath the punch of 4mm, Figure 16. The bevelled ring, including the pins and the punches, \nare all treated as rigid bodies. The punch is displacement driven in the transverse direction (normal to \nthe disc) and standard contact definitions are applied between the composite disc, the punch and the \nring. \n \nThe proposed combined \u2018Ladev\u00e8ze-Puck\u2019 material model is used to represent the composite discs. The \nshell element used is a multilayered element in which the fibre orientation for each ply is defined \n 11 \nusing material model parameters summarised in Appendix I. The experimental and predicted force-\ndisplacement curves are shown in Table 4, and computed contour plots of fibre and matrix damage are \ndisplayed in Table 5. \n \nDiscussion of Results: The simulation results of the discs can be divided into two principal structural \nfailure types; namely, fibre dominated and matrix dominated failure. Fibre dominated structural failure \nis predicted for the [0\/90\/\u00b145]s, [\u00b145]2s and, to a lesser extent, the [\u00b138\/\u00b152]s discs; whereas matrix \ndominated failure is predicted for the [\u00b135]2s discs. These predicted global failure modes are in good \nagreement with corresponding ultrasonic C-SCAN measurements of the tested discs, Figure 17. \n \nFibre dominated structural failure of [0\/90\/\u00b145]s, [\u00b145]2s and [\u00b138\/\u00b152]s discs: For the larger \npunch failure is indicated by sudden straight laminate cracks radiating between the disc centre and \nouter rim, whereas the smaller punch predicts localised disc penetration failure, Table 5. The predicted \nglobal failure patterns agree well with the experiments, previously shown in Figure 15. Furthermore, \nthe predicted force-displacement curves for these tests are generally in good agreement with \nexperimental results, Table 4. \n \nMatrix dominated structural failure of [\u00b135]2s discs: Matrix dominated structural failure is \npredicted for both punches, Table 5. In each case matrix damage originates beneath the punch and then \ngradually propagates toward the outer composite rim, structural failure occurs once the damage front \napproaches the bearing.  \n \nIt is interesting to note that similar experimental force-displacement curves were obtained for both \npunch sizes for the [\u00b135]2s discs. The predicted force-displacement curves for the [\u00b135]2s discs exhibit \nearlier structural failure than the corresponding experiments. A likely reason is that mechanical failure \ndata for intra-laminar matrix failure underestimates the true material strength. It has been observed \nexperimentally that there is a size effect in that wider specimens provide greater strength and strain to \nfailure. The cut face, especially for narrow coupons, provides a source of stress concentrations leading \nto premature failure; this condition is not representative of the semi-continuous material at the centre \nof the disc. Never-the-less, it is encouraging that this relatively simple and efficient Finite Element \napproach, using shell elements with average edge lengths suitable for large industrial FE analysis \nproblems, can realistically predict failure for all the considered cases. \n \n4. Conclusions \nAn experimental test programme using biaxial carbon\/epoxy Non Crimp Fabric composites has been \nundertaken to establish a data set for matrix and fibre dominated damage and failure. Fabric pre-shear \nof biaxial NCF, potentially occurring during the preforming operation in complex shaped composite \n 12 \nparts, has to be addressed in failure analysis since fibre re-orientation renders the composite vulnerable \nto catastrophic combined matrix transverse-shear failure. Hence, the experimental test series has  \nincluded the investigation of both unsheared and presheared biaxial NCF having differing degrees of \nfabric pre-shear. From this data a new failure law has been proposed that combines the elasto-plastic \ndamaging constitutive model of Ladev\u00e8ze and Le Dantec with the intra-laminar matrix failure model \nby Puck. Based on physical considerations, an exponential shear damage function has been \nestablished, which allows an improved representation of the shear damage development in these \nmaterials. All simulation methodologies have been implemented and tested using a research version of \nthe PAMCRASHTM code. \n \nThe \u2018Puck\u2019 matrix failure envelope was successfully calibrated to account for failure of unsheared and \npre-sheared biaxial NCF composites. The combined \u2018Ladev\u00e8ze-Puck\u2019 model has been validated using \nunsheared and pre-sheared NCF composite discs subject to quasi-static transverse loading. These tests \ngenerated a variety of global failure mechanisms, which could be well predicted by numerical \nsimulation. Furthermore, the overall agreement of experimental and predicted punch force-\ndisplacement curves has been encouraging. It is felt that the proposed test and simulation procedures \nwould also be applicable to other biaxial fabric composites such as woven fabrics. \n \nReferences \n[1] Hart-Smith LJ, \u201cPredictions of the original and truncated maximum-strain failure models for \ncertain fibrous composite laminates\u201d, Composites Science and Technology, 1998, 58(7), pp. \n1151-1178.  \n[2] Harris B, Chou TW, Mai YW, Hinton MJ, Soden PD, Kaddour AS, \u201cFailure criteria in fibre-\nreinforced polymer composites\u201d, Composites Science and Technology, Special Issue, Vol. 58, \nJuly 1998. \n[3] Puck A, Sch\u00fcrmann H, \u201cFailure analysis of FRP laminates by means of physically based \nphenomenological models\u201d, Composites Science and Technology, Volume 62, Issues 12-13, \nSeptember-October 2002, pp. 1633-1662. \n[4] Hinton MJ, Kaddour AS, Soden PD, \u201dA comparison of the predictive capabilities of current \nfailure theories for composite laminates, judged against experimental evidence\u201d, Composites \nScience and Technology, Vol. 62, Issues 12-13, September-October 2002, pp. 1725-1797. \n[5] Cuntze RG, \u201cThe predictive capability of failure mode concept-based strength criteria for multi-\ndirectional laminates\u2014part B\u201d, Composites Science and Technology, Vol. 64, Issues 3-4, 2004, \npp. 487\u2013516. \n[6] Hinton MJ, Kaddour AS, Soden PD, \u201cRecommendations for designers and researchers resulting \nfrom the world-wide failure exercise\u201d, Composites Science and Technology, Vol. 64, Issues 3-4, \n2004, pp. 589\u2013604. \n 13 \n[7] Ladev\u00e8ze P, Le Dantec E, \u201cDamage Modelling of the elementary ply for laminated composites\u201d, \nComposites Science and Technology, Vol. 43, Issue 3, 1992, pp. 257-267. \n[8] PAM-CRASH\u2122 Users manuals, Engineering Systems International, 20 Rue Saarinen, Silic 270, \n94578 Rungis-Cedex, France. www.esi-group.com \n[9] Johnson AF, Pickett AK, Rozycki P, \"Computational methods for predicting impact damage in \ncomposite structures\", Composites Science and Technology, Vol. 61, Issue 15, 2001, pp. 2183-\n2192. \n[10] Pickett AK, Fouinneteau MRC, \u201cMaterial characterisation and calibration of a meso-mechanical \ndamage model for braid reinforced composites\u201d, Composites Science and Technology, In Press \n2005. \n[11] ASTM Standard (1995b), \u201cStandard test method for tensile properties of polymer matrix \ncomposite materials\u201d, D3039. \n[12] ASTM Standard (1995a), \u201cStandard test method for compressive properties of polymer matrix \ncomposite materials with unsupported gauge section by shear loading\u201d, D3410\/D3410M-94. \n[13] Ladev\u00e8ze P, Lubineau G, \u201cOn a damage meso-model for laminates: micro-mechanics basis and \nimprovement\u201d, Mechanics of Materials, 2002. \n[14] Puck A, \u201cFestigkeitsanalyse von Faser-Matrix-Laminaten : Modelle f\u00fcr die Praxis\u201d, Hanser \nVerlag M\u00fcnchen Wien, 1996. \n[15] Daniel IM, Ishai O, \u201cEngineering mechanics of composite materials\u201d, Oxford University Press, \nInc., 1994, ISBN 0-19-507506-4. \n[16] Greve L, Pickett AK, \u201cDelamination testing and modelling for composite crash simulation\u201d, \nComposites Science and Technology, 2005 [online available]. \n \n 14 \nFigures \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1.

Pickett* School of Industrial and Manufacturing Science, Cranfield University, Bedford, \nMK43 0AL, United Kingdom \n \nAbstract \nA numerical material model for intra-laminar failure prediction of biaxial Non Crimp Fabric \ncomposites is presented. The model combines the elasto-plastic continuum damage constitutive model \nproposed by Ladev\u00e8ze with the intra-laminar matrix failure model of Puck, and improves the shear \ndamage representation using an exponential damage function. The work focuses on numerical model \ndevelopment for damage and failure prediction and validation for both unsheared and sheared fabric \ncomposites which will result from draping of the fabric preform over a double curved geometry in \norder to manufacture complex shaped parts. An extensive test program has been conducted using flat \ncomposite coupons with differing degrees of fabric pre-shear in order to establish a database of \nmaterial stiffness, strength, and in-plane matrix shear damage evolution prior to failure. This database \nis used to identify parameters for the proposed \u2018Ladev\u00e8ze-Puck\u2019 damage and failure model. Final \nvalidation has been made by implementing the model in an explicit Finite Element code and \nperforming a series of experimental and simulation analyses on transversely loaded circular composite \ndiscs having differing degrees of fabric pre-shear. The model has been shown to successfully capture \nintra-ply failure modes in the principle fibre directions for tension and compression, intra-ply shear \nand also the interaction of these modes. \n \nKeywords \nA.

Introduction \nAdvanced composites using Non Crimp Fabrics (NCF) and Liquid Composite Moulding (LCM) \ntechnologies are becoming increasingly attractive to the automotive (and other) industries for the \neconomical manufacture of high performance parts in small series production runs. The absence of \ncrimp gives high specific stiffness and strength, and biaxial NCF textile forms offer excellent \ndrapeability for the manufacture of complex shapes. However, predictive failure models for these \ncomposites, suitable for impact and crash analysis, which can also account for fabric preshear, is \nrequired.  \n \nThe potential intra-laminar failure modes of biaxial NCF are failure in one of the two fibre directions; \neither in tension or compression, and intra-laminar shear failure leading to fibre-matrix debonding. \nLamina transverse matrix failure might also be observed; however, this mode will not initiate \ncatastrophic ply failure since loading will be effectively transferred by the orthogonal tows of the \nadjacent plies. This is an observation recognised by Hart-Smith [1] in failure criteria he developed for \n 3 \nUnidirectional (UD) cross plies composites. A further possible composite failure mode is ply \ndelamination; which has been investigated in a previous publication by the authors []. This failure \nmode is not considered here. \n \nThe excellent drapeability of NCF\u2019s allows both single and complex double curvature shapes to be \nformed, Figure 1. The shaping operation may cause extensive fabric shearing which will significantly \nmodify local composite stiffness and strength properties. In excessively sheared areas fibre alignment \nwill enhance strength in the fibre directions and render the composite vulnerable to failure under \ncombined tension-shear loading in the transverse direction, Figure 1. For the work presented here a \n\u00b145\u00b0 biaxial NCF having the specifications shown in Table 1 is used. \n \nDuring the past three decades many composites failure models have been proposed and several have \nfound their way into commercial Finite Element (FE) codes for prediction of ply failure. A \nrecent comprehensive study to evaluate the most promising of these has been presented [2]\n Greve L, Pickett AK, \u201cDelamination testing and modelling for composite crash simulation\u201d, \nComposites Science and Technology, in press, 2005. \n[]. From this study the \u2018Puck\u2019 model [] was highly rated and has been considered \u201cto be the best at \ncapturing the qualitative characteristics of lamina and laminate behaviour\u201d []. However, it was noted \nthat this theory neglected inelastic material deformations which led to significant underestimation of \nstrains for matrix dominated load cases. A further noteworthy contribution to this study was by Cuntze \n[] who, in many respects used a similar model to \u2018Puck\u2019 [], but also accounted for matrix plasticity. \n \nThe constitutive model proposed by Ladev\u00e8ze and Le Dantec [] allows representation of matrix \nplasticity, combined with matrix damage; thus providing an improved basis for prediction of the \nstress-strain relation of the material. This paper presents a combination of the \u2018Ladev\u00e8ze\u2019 model and \nthe \u2018Puck\u2019 failure criteria to treat in-plane failure of carbon NCF reinforced composites under \ncombined loading conditions; further improvements for representation of matrix shear damage \ndevelopment in NCF composites have also been necessary. The next section introduces the failure \nmodels, followed by sections on parameter identification and validation. Both unsheared and pre-\nsheared fabric composites have been considered in the experimental and numerical work. It is believed \nthat the techniques presented are, in principle, also applicable to other biaxial textile reinforced \ncomposites such as conventional woven fabrics. \n \n 4 \n2. Material Modelling \n2.1. The damage constitutive model \nThe classical continuum damage mechanics model proposed by Ladev\u00e8ze and Le Dantec has been \nimplemented in a multi-layered thin shell element in the explicit Finite Element code PAM-CRASHTM \n[]. This allows each ply in the laminate to be represented using an orthotropic elasto-plastic, with \ndamage, stress-strain relationship given by, \n{ } [ ]{ }e\u03b5C\u03c3 =  . (2-1) \nThe stress and strain vectors are, \n{ } { }TT 3123122211 \u03c3\u03c3\u03c3\u03c3\u03c3\u03c3 = , \nand \n{ } { }TeeeeeTe 3123212211 \u03b5\u03b5\u03b5\u03b5\u03b5=\u03b5 , \nand the stiffness matrix [C] has the following form and coefficients, \n[ ]\n( )\n( )\n( )\n( )\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ee\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n=\n12\n0\n12\n12\n0\n23\n12\n0\n12\n22\n0\n22\n0\n11\n0\n21\n0\n11\n0\n21\n0\n11\n10000\n01000\n00100\n0001\n000\ndG\ndG\ndG\ndCC\nCC\n\u03c5\n\u03c5\nC , (2-2) \nwith \n0\n21\n0\n12\n0\n110\n11 1 \u03c5\u03c5\u2212\n=\nEC  ; 0\n21\n0\n12\n0\n220\n22 1 \u03c5\u03c5\u2212\n=\nEC .  \nIn the above equations the material constants 011E  and \n0\n22E are elastic modulii in the fibre and \ntransverse directions, 0ijG  is shear modulus, and \n0\nij\u03c5  is Poisson\u2019s ratio. The matrix dominated elastic \nmodulii, E220, G120, and G230, are modified by the damage functions (1-dij) during loading to failure. \nTwo scalar damage functions d22 and d12 are introduced, having the range 0 (no damage) to 1.0 (fully \ndamaged) to describe matrix damage development in the ply transverse and shear directions, \nrespectively. Some simplifications for numerical implementation are made for out-of plane shear \nmodulii. Based on the assumption of transverse isotropy, the shear modulus in the 1-2 and 1-3 \ndirections are considered equal, G130 = G120. Consequently, equal damage development in both \ndirections is assumed, d13 = d12. For the sake of simplicity shear damage in the 2-3 direction is related \nto in-plane shear damage development, d23 = d12. The theory assumes constant Poisson\u2019s ratio \ncoefficients. \n \nThe damage functions (d22 and d12) are associated with conjugate quantities Y22 and Y12, which govern \ndamage development. These quantities are partial derivatives of damaged elastic work with respect to \n 5 \nthe damage state and are analogous to the strain energy release rate Gic used in classical Fracture \nMechanics to describe strain energy released during crack growth [].

(2-5) \n \nDamage development under matrix transverse compression loading is prohibited, equation (2-4), due \nto the assumption that existing matrix micro-cracks will close under compression loading, in which \ncase the initial transverse elastic modulus is recovered. Damage interaction is introduced by the \nparameter b , leading to the final governing equation for coupled transverse-shear damage, \n( ) ( ) ( )( )\u03c4\u03c4\u03c4 2212sup bYYtY t += \u2264 . (2-6) \nGenerally the coupling factor b is determined from experiments.  \n \nEnhancements to shear damage representation for NCF \nA lamina under pure in-plane intra-laminar shear loading will exhibit matrix micro-cracks after a \ncertain threshold stress is exceeded Figure 2a. These cracks will be normal to the direction of first \nprincipal stress and will extend until stopped by fibres crossing the crack paths. Continued loading will \ngenerate new parallel cracks, Figure 2b, until a saturated level of matrix micro-cracks is reached, \nFigure 2c. Further loading will cause micro-cracks to coalescence and form a macro-crack leading to \nmaterial fracture Figure 2d. Based on these micro-mechanical considerations a corresponding macro-\nmechanical shear damaging law is proposed to approximate the real physical behaviour of the \ninvestigated NCF composite. An exponential shear damage function is used, in which the damage state \nasymptotically approaches the level of saturated damage, Figure 2e. Similar nonlinear shear damage \ndevelopment has also been observed and used for woven fabric pre-preg composites [] and biaxial \nbraid composites [2]. In the nonlinear shear damage function, Figure 2, 012Y  represents the initiation of \nshear damage, fitY12  is a fitting parameter for the shape of the shear damage evolution curve, and Satd  \nrepresents the saturation damage level.  \n \nMatrix plasticity \nA cyclic tensile coupon test of a [\u00b145]2s laminate is used to characterise evolution of matrix shear \ndamage and plasticity. The global laminate stresses and strains are transformed to assess the local ply \n 6 \nshear stress-strain curve, Figure 3. The degradation of the ply shear modulus G12,i and the generation \nof inelastic ply deformation p i,12\u03b3  can be clearly observed. \n \nFor NCF the plasticity model proposed by Ladev\u00e8ze and Le Dantec for UD composites [] has been \nfound appropriate and is used here. Briefly, this is simple Von Mises yield criteria using an associated \nflow rule to monitor the evolution of permanent plastic strains in the matrix caused by the transverse \nand shear strain components, \n( ) 0~~ 222212 =\u2212+= pRaf \u03c3\u03c3 , (2-7) \nwith the effective stresses, \nij\nij\nij d\n\u03c3\n\u2212\n=\n1\n~ \u03c3 . (2-8) \nFactor 2a  can account for material anisotropy. Assuming an isotropic matrix material it can be shown \nfrom the \u2018Von Mises\u2019 yield condition that 312 =a .  \n \nA power law is assumed for plastic strain hardening, \nR(p) = Ro+\u03b2 pm, (2-9) \nwhere R0 is the shear yield stress, \u03b2 and m are curve fitting parameters. The equivalent plastic strain p \nis given by, \n( )\u222b \u2212= pddp 12121 \u03b3 , (2-10) \nwhere the plastic shear strain increment pd 12\u03b3  is the difference between the total and elastic shear \nstrain increments, \netp ddd 121212 \u03b3\u03b3\u03b3 \u2212= . (2-11) \n \nMaterial parameter identification \nThe shear damage development and plastic hardening curve are determined by quasi-static cyclic \ntensile testing of [\u00b145]2s NCF composite coupons to failure, Figure 4. A rate of loading of 0.5 mm\/min \nin an Instron 5500R-6025 testing machine has been used. The parameter identification for shear \nfollows the procedures outlined in [] with the new exponential shear damage function. Figure 5a,b \nshows the good fit of damage and hardening functions to experimental data points. For this work the \nexponential shear damage function has been implemented and used in a research version of the FE \ncode PAMCRASHTM.  \n \nThe calibrated model parameters are summarised in Appendix I. Simulation of the cyclic tensile test \nusing the new exponential damage function yields very good agreement with the experimental results, \nas shown by comparison of the longitudinal stress-strain curves in Figure 5c. Another simulation \n 7 \ncurve, computed using the original linear damaging function, is included for comparison. The linear \ndamage approach leads to higher stresses at the beginning due to the underestimation of the damage \nstate, Figure 5a. Furthermore, premature specimen failure is observed in this simulation once \ndamaging localises and approaches the limiting value 1.0. \n \nThe original \u2018Ladev\u00e8ze\u2019 model allows coupling of transverse tension damage and shear damage; b \u2260 0 \nin equation (2-6). However, since carbon\/epoxy biaxial NCF composites exhibit brittle elastic \ntransverse tensile failure without significant damaging it is assumed that transverse deformation does \nnot contribute to shear damage development; thus shear damage development is solely governed by \nshear deformation; 0\u2192b . \n \n2.2. The Intra-laminar failure model \nFibre dominated failure: The elastic lamina modulii in the fibre direction ( ctE ,11 ) and the \ncorresponding maximum elastic strains ( max,11 ct\u03b5 ) have been obtained using standard tension and \ncompression tests of [0\/90]2s NCF coupons according to ASTM standards [3] and [4], Figure 6. The \nmaterial model parameters obtained from these tests are summarised in Appendix I. \n \nMatrix dominated failure: The in-plane intra-laminar matrix failure envelope proposed by Puck for a \nunidirectional lamina is represented by three different inter-connected curve functions, each \nrepresenting a distinct failure mode A, B, and C, as shown in Figure 7. \n \nThe original \u2018Ladev\u00e8ze\u2019 model contains a failure criterion for matrix failure which is directly related \nthe to damage development []. As previously mentioned, only shear damage is assumed to be active \noccur under transverse compression loading, giving an open matrix failure envelope in the transverse \ncompression direction, Figure 8. This is felt to be inappropriate for the NCF composite investigated \nhere; although it is noted that recent work by Ladev\u00e8ze et al. [5], has enhanced this failure mode to \ninclude transverse compression. In this work, however, the established \u2018Puck\u2019 failure criterion is \npreferred, so that matrix damage development and the matrix failure criterion are completely \nuncoupled.  \n \nFor numerical integration of the Puck matrix failure criterion into an FE code it is convenient to use a \nscaling distance \u03bb,  defined as the ratio of the current stress vector {\u03c3} to the extrapolated vector at the \nfailure envelope {\u03c3fail}, Figure 8, such that, \n{ } { }fail\u03c3\u03c3 \u03bb= , \nwith \n(2-12) \n 8 \n\uf8f4\uf8f3\n\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f1\n\u2212>\n<\n=\nfailurepost\nfailure\nfailureno\n1\n1\n1\n\u03bb\n. \n(2-13) \nBased on the equations for matrix failure [6] the maximum \u03bb  for the different failure modes follows \nas, \n( )\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n\u2264\u2264<\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n\u2264\u2264<\n\u2265\n=\n\u22a5\u22a5\n\u22a5\u22a5\nc\nA\nModeC\nc\nA\nModeB\nModeA\nR\nandif\nR\nandif\nif\n1222\n12\n22\n1212\n22\n22\n22\n00\n00\n0\n\u03c3\u03c3\n\u03c3\n\u03c3\u03bb\n\u03c3\u03c3\n\u03c3\n\u03c3\u03bb\n\u03c3\u03bb\n\u03bb .

Testing coupons were manufactured from dry orthotropic biaxial NCF which were \nmanually pre-sheared from \u00b145\u00b0 to \u00b1\u03c6\u00b0 and stacked in a sequence of [\u00b1\u03c6]2s prior to Vacuum Assisted \nResin Infusion (VARI). The coupons were then cut from the manufactured panels, providing different \n 9 \nlay-up\u2019s ([\u00b1\u03c6]2s, [\u00b1(90-\u03c6)]2s, and [0\/2\u03c6]2s) as indicated in Figure 9a. Two different pre-sheared \ncomposites were investigated; the first representing moderate fabric pre-shear (\u03c6 = 35\u00b0) and the \nsecond representing greater pre-shear (\u03c6 = 28\u00b0). The laminate thickness has been increased according \nto the amount of pre-shear in order to keep the fibre volume ratio approximately constant at Vf = 0.48 \nthroughout the test programme. \n \nFlat coupons were used for tension and compression testing using the procedures in [3] and [4] \nrespectively, Figure 9b,c. All specimens were tested quasi-statically at 0.5 mm\/min to failure in an \nInstron 5500R-6025 testing machine. The full testing programme undertaken is summarised in Figure \n9d. Specimens tested in the fibre directions used monotonic loading to failure in tension and \ncompression. The remaining specimens, [\u00b1\u03c6]2s and [\u00b1(90-\u03c6)]2s, were tested using cyclic tension \nloading to failure in order to determine damage evolution and plasticity prior to failure. Table 1 \nsummarises all results for fibre (tension and compression), and the cyclic shear failure cases. \n \nTest results show an extensive nonlinear inelastic response for the [\u00b128]2s and [\u00b135]2s symmetric \ncyclic tension test coupons. Tension testing of the [\u00b155]2s and [\u00b162]2s coupons leads to a more linear \nelastic longitudinal stress-strain relation due to the increased contribution of elastic transverse loading. \nSpecimens loaded in the fibre direction, [0\/2\u03c6]2s, generally exhibit brittle elastic failure under both \ntension and compression loading. For all these tensile tests it is noted that only minor experimental \nscatter is observed. \n \nAn inverse approach is used for the calibration of the matrix failure envelope. The procedure is \nvisualised in Figure 10, and explained below. \n \nThe [\u00b1\u03d5]2s and [\u00b1(90-\u03d5)]2s tension tests are modelled using multi-layered shell Finite Elements in \nPAM-CRASHTM, and simulated in order to determine the material model parameters for the matrix \nfailure envelope. The simulations are stopped at the point of failure according to the maximum \nobserved experimental longitudinal strain and stress traces (\u03c312 versus) of a ply element within the \nfailure zone of each simulated test case are collected on to one chart, Figure 11. Within some \nsimulations structural failure is initiated by fibre failure (denoted by square symbol in Figure 11). The \nremaining (circular) end points of the stress traces are used to \u2018fit\u2019 the \u2018Puck\u2019 failure envelope. Thus \nthe puck failure envelope obtained is valid for all unsheared and pre-sheared NCF composites tested. \nThe basic strength (\u03c322 for an individual ply) in transverse tension and compression direction cannot be \ndetermined from the biaxial NCF composite. Hence, these strengths have been estimated from tests on \na unidirectional NCF having similar carbon\/epoxy systems. \n \n 10 \nThe material model parameters determined are summarised in Appendix I. For confirmation of this \ninverse material model parameter identification procedure, simulations of all test cases were repeated \nusing the matrix failure model parameters identified. The computed stress-strain curves to failure are \nin good agreement with the experiments, Table 2. \n \n3. Validation of Simulation Methodologies: Transversely Loaded Composite Discs \nThe previous section has outlined the test and material parameter identification procedures used to \ndetermine failure data for unsheared and pre-sheared NCF composites. This section describes a test \nthat has been devised to validate the material models and material parameters.  \n \nThe test involves circular composite discs of 120mm diameter which are simply supported on their \nperimeter and quasi-statically loaded transversely at their centre with a rigid hemispherical punch of \n25mm or 50mm diameter. The discs rest on a slightly bevelled (15\u00b0) ring and are constrained by three \nconcentric pins, Figure 12, to provide the simple support condition. The test setup was specially \ndesigned to realise rotational symmetry and minimise bearing effects on the boundary. The loading \nrate to failure was 0.5mm\/min in an Instron 5500R-6025 testing machine. Different lay-ups, including \nunsheared and pre-sheared NCF, were used in this validation exercise. \n \nDisc Manufacture and Testing: Flat panels of NCF composite were manufactured using the VARI \nprocess having lay-ups of [0\/90\/\u00b145]s, [\u00b145]2s, [\u00b138\/\u00b152]s, and [\u00b135]2s. The lay-up\u2019s [\u00b138\/\u00b152]s and \n[\u00b135]2s were generated by manually shearing \u00b145\u00b0 biaxial fabrics. The circular discs were then cut \nfrom the finished panels and prepared for testing, Table 3. The punch force-displacement curves \nobtained from testing are summarised in Figure 13 and Figure 14. \n \nAll tests display a gradually increasing force until first structural failure. The 50mm diameter punch \nspecimens tend to exhibit failure by a sudden crack developing between the punch and the outer rim of \nthe disc, which leads to a rapid drop in force. The post failure force response displays significant \nresidual strength after first structural failure since the large punch allows force redistribution away \nfrom the damage area beneath the punch. The smaller punch creates greater confined local damage as \nit penetrates the disc. Figure 15 shows typical final deformations of the composite discs after \ntransverse loading by the large and the small punch. Only minor scatter is observed for tests using the \nlarger punch, whereas more variation is found for the force-displacement curves of the smaller punch \nspecimens. Most scatter is observed in the pre-sheared [\u00b138\/\u00b152]s specimens. \n \nSimulation of the Disc Tests: The composite discs have been modelled using an average element \nlength beneath the punch of 4mm, Figure 16. The bevelled ring, including the pins and the punches, \nare all treated as rigid bodies. The punch is displacement driven in the transverse direction (normal to \n 11 \nthe disc) and standard contact definitions are applied between the composite disc, the punch and the \nring. \n \nThe proposed combined \u2018Ladev\u00e8ze-Puck\u2019 material model is used to represent the composite discs. The \nshell element used is a multilayered element in which the fibre orientation for each ply is defined \nusing material model parameters summarised in Appendix I. The experimental and predicted force-\ndisplacement curves are shown in Table 4, and computed contour plots of fibre and matrix damage are \ndisplayed in Table 5. \n \nDiscussion of Results: The simulation results of the discs can be divided into two principal structural \nfailure types; namely, fibre dominated and matrix dominated failure. Fibre dominated structural failure \nis predicted for the [0\/90\/\u00b145]s, [\u00b145]2s and, to a lesser extent, the [\u00b138\/\u00b152]s discs; whereas matrix \ndominated failure is predicted for the [\u00b135]2s discs. These predicted global failure modes are in good \nagreement with corresponding ultrasonic C-SCAN measurements of the tested discs, Figure 17. \n \nFibre dominated structural failure of [0\/90\/\u00b145]s, [\u00b145]2s and [\u00b138\/\u00b152]s discs: For the larger \npunch failure is indicated by sudden straight laminate cracks radiating between the disc centre and \nouter rim, whereas the smaller punch predicts localised disc penetration failure, Table 5. The predicted \nglobal failure patterns agree well with the experiments, previously shown in Figure 15. Furthermore, \nthe predicted force-displacement curves for these tests are generally in good agreement with \nexperimental results, Table 4. \n \nMatrix dominated structural failure of [\u00b135]2s discs: Matrix dominated structural failure is \npredicted for both punches, Table 5. In each case matrix damage originates beneath the punch and then \ngradually propagates toward the outer composite rim, structural failure occurs once the damage front \napproaches the bearing.  \n \nIt is interesting to note that similar experimental force-displacement curves were obtained for both \npunch sizes for the [\u00b135]2s discs. The predicted force-displacement curves for the [\u00b135]2s discs exhibit \nearlier structural failure than the corresponding experiments. A likely reason is that mechanical failure \ndata for intra-laminar matrix failure underestimates the true material strength. It has been observed \nexperimentally that there is a size effect in that wider specimens provide greater strength and strain to \nfailure. The cut face, especially for narrow coupons, provides a source of stress concentrations leading \nto premature failure; this condition is not representative of the semi-continuous material at the centre \nof the disc. Never-the-less, it is encouraging that this relatively simple and efficient Finite Element \napproach, using shell elements with average edge lengths suitable for large industrial FE analysis \nproblems, can realistically predict failure for all the considered cases. \n 12 \n \n4. Conclusions \nAn experimental test programme using biaxial carbon\/epoxy Non Crimp Fabric composites has been \nundertaken to establish a data set for matrix and fibre dominated damage and failure. Fabric pre-shear \nof biaxial NCF, potentially occurring during the preforming operation in complex shaped composite \nparts, has to be addressed in failure analysis since fibre re-orientation renders the composite vulnerable \nto catastrophic combined matrix transverse-shear failure. Hence, the experimental test series has  \nincluded the investigation of both unsheared and presheared biaxial NCF having differing degrees of \nfabric pre-shear. From this data a new failure law has been proposed that combines the elasto-plastic \ndamaging constitutive model of Ladev\u00e8ze and Le Dantec with the intra-laminar matrix failure model \nby Puck. Based on physical considerations, an exponential shear damage function has been \nestablished, which allows an improved representation of the shear damage development in these \nmaterials. All simulation methodologies have been implemented and tested using a research version of \nthe PAMCRASHTM code. \n \nThe \u2018Puck\u2019 matrix failure envelope was successfully calibrated to account for failure of unsheared and \npre-sheared biaxial NCF composites. The combined \u2018Ladev\u00e8ze-Puck\u2019 model has been validated using \nunsheared and pre-sheared NCF composite discs subject to quasi-static transverse loading. These tests \ngenerated a variety of global failure mechanisms, which could be well predicted by numerical \nsimulation. Furthermore, the overall agreement of experimental and predicted punch force-\ndisplacement curves has been encouraging. It is felt that the proposed test and simulation procedures \nwould also be applicable to other biaxial fabric composites such as woven fabrics. \n \nReferences \n[1] Hart-Smith LJ, \u201cPredictions of the original and truncated maximum-strain failure models for \ncertain fibrous composite laminates\u201d, Composites Science and Technology, 1998, 58(7), pp. \n1151-1178.  \n[2] Greve L, Pickett AK, \u201cDelamination testing and modelling for composite crash simulation\u201d, \nComposites Science and Technology, in press, 2005. \n[3] Harris B, Chou TW, Mai YW, Hinton MJ, Soden PD, Kaddour AS, \u201cFailure criteria in fibre-\nreinforced polymer composites\u201d, Composites Science and Technology, Special Issue, Vol. 58, \nJuly 1998. \n[4] Puck A, Sch\u00fcrmann H, \u201cFailure analysis of FRP laminates by means of physically based \nphenomenological models\u201d, Composites Science and Technology, Volume 62, Issues 12-13, \nSeptember-October 2002, pp. 1633-1662. \n 13 \n[5] Hinton MJ, Kaddour AS, Soden PD, \u201dA comparison of the predictive capabilities of current \nfailure theories for composite laminates, judged against experimental evidence\u201d, Composites \nScience and Technology, Vol. 62, Issues 12-13, September-October 2002, pp. 1725-1797. \n[6] Cuntze RG, \u201cThe predictive capability of failure mode concept-based strength criteria for multi-\ndirectional laminates\u2014part B\u201d, Composites Science and Technology, Vol. 64, Issues 3-4, 2004, \npp. 487\u2013516. \n[7] Hinton MJ, Kaddour AS, Soden PD, \u201cRecommendations for designers and researchers resulting \nfrom the world-wide failure exercise\u201d, Composites Science and Technology, Vol. 64, Issues 3-4, \n2004, pp. 589\u2013604. \n[8] Ladev\u00e8ze P, Le Dantec E, \u201cDamage Modelling of the elementary ply for laminated composites\u201d, \nComposites Science and Technology, Vol. 43, Issue 3, 1992, pp. 257-267. \n[9] PAM-CRASH\u2122 Users manuals, Engineering Systems International, 20 Rue Saarinen, Silic 270, \n94578 Rungis-Cedex, France. www.esi-group.com \n[10] Johnson AF, Pickett AK, Rozycki P, \"Computational methods for predicting impact damage in \ncomposite structures\", Composites Science and Technology, Vol. 61, Issue 15, 2001, pp. 2183-\n2192. \n[2] Pickett AK, Fouinneteau MRC, \u201cMaterial characterisation and calibration of a meso-mechanical \ndamage model for braid reinforced composites\u201d, Composites Science and Technology, In Press \n2005. \n[3] ASTM Standard (1995b), \u201cStandard test method for tensile properties of polymer matrix \ncomposite materials\u201d, D3039. \n[4] ASTM Standard (1995a), \u201cStandard test method for compressive properties of polymer matrix \ncomposite materials with unsupported gauge section by shear loading\u201d, D3410\/D3410M-94. \n[5] Ladev\u00e8ze P, Lubineau G, \u201cOn a damage meso-model for laminates: micro-mechanics basis and \nimprovement\u201d, Mechanics of Materials, 2002. \n[6] Puck A, \u201cFestigkeitsanalyse von Faser-Matrix-Laminaten : Modelle f\u00fcr die Praxis\u201d, Hanser \nVerlag M\u00fcnchen Wien, 1996. \n[7] Daniel IM, Ishai O, \u201cEngineering mechanics of composite materials\u201d, Oxford University Press, \nInc., 1994, ISBN 0-19-507506-4. \n \n 14 \nFigures \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1.

Greve Volkswagen AG, Group Research, 38436 Wolfsburg, Germany \nA. K. Pickett* School of Industrial and Manufacturing Science, Cranfield University, Bedford, \nMK43 0AL, United Kingdom \n \nResponse to reviewers \n \nReviewer #1: The paper presents a new numerical constitutive model for \nunidirectional laminae\/non crimp fabric based on existing Ladeveze and Puck \nmodels. The model is implemented into explicit FE code and validated using \nan extensive range of experimental data. Results from the experimental \nprogramme include a range of fibre layups and pre-shear angles. The model \nis shown to capture the constitutive behaviour for transverse punch-loading \nvery well. \nThe paper is well written and the results are presented clearly and \nthoughtfully -sufficient detail of the model is included.  \nThis is a top quality paper and could be published as-is.  \nMinor recommendations would be to include a comment in the abstract related \nto the accuracy of the model, and to include more detail in the discussion \nof the results. There are a few typos which need correction and the \nreferences need to be reordered. \n \nI have modified: \n\u00be New sentence in the abstract stating accuracy of the model. \n\u00be A few typos (only 3) have been found and corrected. \n\u00be The references have been reordered and are now sequential \n\u00be I could not really see what to add in the discussion of results \nand feel that the important points are covered. Let me know if \nthis is essential. \n \n \nReviewer #2: The authors developed the modeling of intra-laminar failure \nprediction on non-crimp fabric composites which have gained great attention \nin automotive industry. In this manuscript, the authors pointed out that \nconventional Puck's failure modeling neglects inelastic material \ndeformation and this model itself is not suitable to predict the failure of \nnon-crimp fabric composites. Hence, the authors combined Puck's model with \nLadeveze model which takes into account matrix plasticity and failure. \nFailure manner of non-crimp fabric composite disks subjected by the punch \nforce were experimentally investigated and compared with finite element \nresult input by the combined failure model. It was revealed that intra-\nlaminar failure manner experimentally observed in composite disks well \nmatched with the finite element result. It is considered that the failure \nmodeling suggested by the authors is very useful to predict intra-laminar \nfailure of non-crimp composites. Thereby, the publication of this \nmanuscript for Composites Part A is highly recommended without revision. \n \n\u00be No changes were requested.  \n \n                                                          \n* Author for correspondence: Email a.k.p ickett@cranfield.ac.uk  \n* Response to Reviewers\n"}
