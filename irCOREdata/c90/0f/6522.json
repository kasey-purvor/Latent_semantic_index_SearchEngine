However, despite the initial adoption of a traditional learning\nenvironment, the first, albeit influential, generation of software design was poorly\nrecognized, or worse, even met with scepticism by academics inasmuch as it did not seem to\nrepresent or, indeed, symbolize good teaching practices (Laurillard, 1991). As a result,\noriginal CALL programmes, such as gap-filling or substituting exercises, were often only\nconsidered appropriate as supplementary teaching material and, as such, referred to or\nintroduced within courses as convenient adjuncts providing students with greater practical\nexperience. Equally, students as users were never consulted on the use of CALL or, indeed,\nimplicated beyond the designed interaction. Indeed, it was generally assumed that, since\ncomputer-based learning was a new concept, it would be, by itself, attractive and generate\nincreased enthusiasm within the language-learning context. This situation was made even\nworse by a developmental process, dominated by self-taught, in-house authoring, which\nwas too often amateurish, task-based in approach and empirical. Unfortunately, despite\nrecent development in multimedia and hypermedia, this CALL legacy has been affecting\nCALL in design, practice and projected use.\nThe hypermedia platform in CALL\nThe introduction of the multimedia dimension into CALL design with its perceived\ninteractive potential leading to hypermedia developments shed new light on the user\ninteraction and capability of computer-based learning material. The new concepts of\nnavigation and user-controlled access into an open environment, seen as ideal to reproduce\nor replicate virtual language contexts, shifted the pedagogic debate surrounding CALL to\ninclude the possibility of adding computer-based support in communicative skills and\ncompetency. However, given the evolving theoretical positions on methodological\napproaches to second language teaching, such a support with its inherent communicative\npotential also triggered questions linked to the validity of adopted learning processes and\ntheir likely outcomes. This is all the more obvious when considering the differences\nbetween language acquisition and language learning crystallized by hypermedia CALL.\nMoreover, in addition to the complexity of learning processes, this new interactive\npotential brought with it challenging design considerations focusing on user interaction,\ninterface design, structures and strategies which required a greater range of expertise and\ntheoretical underpinning than previously required, or thought necessary, within the design\nprocess. Noticeably, the evolution of the student-computer interaction was affecting the\nrole played by the CALL interface and the degree of involvement and participation\nprovided by the students themselves. Indeed, if the original approach was instructional,\nrelying on a linear and sequential, therefore prescriptive, student interaction, the new\nhypermedia environment, based on student-controlled navigation, was essentially\npredicated upon a purposeful, independent and pro-active interaction requiring an\nhitherto lacking motivation and application on the part of students. Furthermore, such a\nstudent-orientated interaction coupled with the self-contained nature of this new\ninteractive language environment and the increasing use of commercially produced\npackages made the integration of CALL more difficult due to poor complementarity with\nexisting language teaching material and an overall lack of confidence displayed by the\nteaching staff.\nTo attempt to reverse such a trend, this paper purposely focuses on a theoretical approach\nto design, highlighted by design considerations behind a new Web-enhanced CALL\n42\nALT-J Volume 8 Number I\nenvironment supporting French, German and Spanish within the Department of\nLanguage Studies at London Guildhall University. This CALL interface was initiated on\nthe basis of previously identified student requirements and authoring needs, which in turn,\ninformed its design, the student interaction and its usability as well as authoring facilities.\nStudent requirements\nStudent requirements were obtained over a protracted data-gathering exercise focusing on\nthe identification of relevant and reliable representations expressed by students on the\nbasis of their interaction with CALL software during user walkthroughs (Bainbridge,\n1990; Hemard, 1998). These student requirements were gathered by means of short\nmeetings or verbal exchanges with the students concerned, often taking place immediately\nafter the scheduled user walkthroughs, as well as discussions in an attempt to maximize the\nimpact of, and impressions on the interface interacted with. These student requirements\naimed at providing a valuable design support reflecting the widest possible range of\nperceived features in a hypermedia CALL environment on the basis of the students'\nexperience. In this respect, they generated greater understanding and a more precise\nrepresentation of student needs and abilities, helping, in the process, to contribute to the\nprovision of student-centred data supporting the language-learning environment design\nprocess.\nInterface design issues\nScreen display: consistency, clarity and meaningfulness\nOverall, students expressed the need for a good, professionally designed screen display,\nwhich would be consistent, clear and uncluttered, stable and reliable, which would only\ndisplay relevant and useful features and whose icons, symbols and graphical\nrepresentations had to be compatible and standardized. Multimedia extensions needed to\nbe equally displayed and purposeful. The designed environment and its material had to be\nattractive and identifiable in order to make it easily understandable and to facilitate the\nlearning process.\nOn the strength of student requirements, design considerations initially centred on the\nchoice of environment and interface. In order to reduce cognitive overheads related to the\nuser interface, it was agreed to adopt the most readily recognized and interacted-with\nWindows-based environment in the form of a Web browser. Advantages in design terms\nwere numerous and far outweighed perceived limitations. Firstly, the screen display\nadopted known and agreed design standards and protocols providing easily\nunderstandable and, therefore, learnable conventions. Secondly, the Web was widely\navailable as well as being attractive and increasingly popular amongst students. Finally, its\ninterface was felt to be particularly intuitive, possibly as a result of a higher level of\ninteractive exposure than with other environments, but also because it was still, bar the\nrecent flurry of animated objects, clear, unambiguous and reasonably robust. Conversely,\nthe adoption of a Web browser also meant that design trade-offs had to be made. By far\nthe most crucial one was linked to the limited multimedia interaction currently available on\nthe Net. While being confident that this was a temporary technological problem, the fact\nremained that when the decision was made, the Web browser was not perceived as a fully-\nfledged multimedia platform. If multimedia interactivity was largely traded off in the\n43\nDominique Hemard and Steve Cushion Authoring a Web-enhanced interface for a new language-learning environment\ninitial stage for increased intuitiveness and learnability, so too were personalized design\ncharacteristics. The screen display was to adopt the default background, with its\naccustomed display of links, commands and features, and colours were to be used\nparsimoniously. Finally, as an interesting offshoot of the multimedia design trade-off, it\nbecame clear during the evaluation phase that students were far more ready and willing to\ninteract with textual material in a Web-based presentation than they had been previously in\nhypermedia or multimedia environments. Whilst a multimedia dimension was added at a\nlater stage, with sound extensions, and welcomed by students, it clearly showed that\nstudents were still conditioned by the hypertext-based interactivity provided by the Web.\nStudent interaction\nMixed learning environment\nOverwhelmingly, the students required full control over their interaction and wanted to be\nallowed unrestricted movement. However, the point was made that interactive aims and\nobjectives had to be clearly stated if the student interaction was going to be purposeful.\nFurthermore, the interface had to provide clear and appropriate interactive support\ntowards a self-sufficient interaction.\nIn many respects, the mixed learning environment, combining both student-controlled\nnavigational commands and instructional elements, represented the most appropriate and\nversatile construct to be supported by a Web-browser. Capitalizing on the interactive\npotential of the Web, the computer could fulfil the function of a learning tool (Levy, 1998)\nproviding a non-directive or self-directed resource whose interface, in a wider physical\nsense, could, similarly, accommodate the intervention or collaboration of the teacher.\nFurthermore, the Web browser could also support student initiatives and student-led\nactivities and enhance authentic learning activities without the need to evaluate progress or\nperformance. But more importantly, a mixed learning environment approach was seen as\nproviding access to both discrete, language-based instructional activities as well as links to\nrelevant content-based resources, thus bridging the gap between the language structure and\nits content. In this respect, students could benefit from curriculum-based, directed\ninstructions providing language-learning practice and objectives as well as relevant\nlearning resources in an interactive format. Thus, it was hoped that navigational and\ninteractive controls, previously criticized by students for generating a negative,\ncounterproductive interaction, as well as interactive language exercises, equally criticized\nfor being too coercive and limited, could, together better counteract the flaws and\ninadequacies of the computer within the language-learning process.\nStructural model\nIn the mixed environment mode, a root and branch or network approach with nuclei of\naccessible discrete composites is a flexible and appealing structure within a hypermedia\nCALL environment. Branching routes can conveniently accommodate specific content-\nbased units interconnected by associative links (Grabinger and Dunlap, 1996) with discrete\nsub-networks attached for greater exploration, interactive participation or specific task-\nbased activities. Levy (1999) likens this learning environment to a 'holistic-discrete\napproach', highlighting its adaptability to and appropriateness with Web technologies and\naccess. Moreover, Jacobson (1994) highlights the interrelated and web-like nature of\nknowledge which needs fixed as well as variable links to connect and assemble thematic\n44\nAa-j Volume 8 Number I\napproaches and concepts with real applications. Therefore, its structural model, or\nstructured learning interaction (Boyle, 1997; Kommers et al., 1996), was conceived on the\nbasis of a student-controlled navigational space with embedded associations in the form of\nhypertext links, albeit supporting directional, interactive branches with sequential links,\nthemselves accommodating more appropriate deductive and inductive learning modes.\nAt the design level, the clear advantage of such an approach was strategic as well as\ntechnological. Firstly, it became possible to focus on the broad structure and overall goals\nof the environment whilst developing isolated interactive nuclei, in the form of interactive\nlanguage exercises built within Java applets, separately and therefore more manageably. At\na more pragmatic and technological level, expertise and capabilities could be better spread\nout and adapted to a wider range of different task-based sub-components. Likewise, this\nstructure could be used for an inductive approach wherein language tasks, requiring a more\nsystematic and sequential approach, could be branched, and exercises and activities\nbunched and attached, creating controlled loops within a more exploratory environment.\nIn this respect, task-based activities could be organized hierarchically or freely accessed\nand controlled by students. Finally, such a structural model, encompassing mixed learning\nstrategies and activities as well as a variety of different and discrete interactive\nenvironments, was seen as being easily identifiable and applicable to students, who were\nthemselves familiar with a modular programme of studies and a multi-site university.\nIndeed, this hypercontext (Barrett, 1994) comprises classroom teaching, but also,\nincreasingly, self-access networked language resources designed to promote active learning,\ndeeper contextual understanding and increased adaptability. Thus, this structural model\nwas designed to support a wide range of student interaction linked to a different\nexploitation of relevant textual material, be it exploratory or directional, to focus on, for\ninstance, listening, gap-fill, vocabulary-building and grammar exercises.\nUsability\nAs a high-level design consideration, usability went beyond usability features of the\ndesigned application to include wider aspects related to access, assimilation and\nintegration. Given the prevalent negative attitudes observed amongst a disenfranchised\nstudent population, it was felt that a particularly important objective of the new\nenvironment was to reintroduce and reinstate both the CALL concept and practice within\nthe students' learning experience with a view to meeting two important requirements:\nspecificity and applicability (Carroll, 1991).\nThe majority of student requirements focused on the perceived inadequacies of the\nfunctionality, limiting the usability of applications such as the complexity and prescriptive\nnature of tasks, warnings and locking mechanisms. However, some requirements were\nparticularly pertinent to a higher level usability. For instance, the point was made that\nmultimedia was not by its very nature attractive, and that, therefore, it had to be made so\nby design. Similarly, a recurrent concern was raised that students' own motivation needed\nto be maintained throughout the interaction. Overwhelmingly, students indicated that they\ncould not see the point of using CALL applications within their own language context and\nfelt that introductory suggestions of language-learning approaches with their\nrecommended access modes ought to be provided to instil a greater sense of purpose and\n45\nDominique Hemard and Steve Cushion Authoring a Web-enhanced interface for a new language-learning environment\nration d'itre into CALL. Finally, it was thought that clearer links between applications and\nlanguage teaching programmes would generate a more fruitful interaction and make the\ndesign more adaptable to the different levels of student needs and language expertise. Of\ninterest in this particular context was the fact that the students' main referential criteria\nwere noticeably drawn from their own and often negative interaction in language\nlaboratory conditions.\nAs a result, it was agreed that the best way to meet requirements such as specificity and\napplicability to generate a purposeful interaction was by a process of assimilation. Indeed,\nassimilation was to become an important objective of the project and influenced the design\nprocess at two distinct conceptual levels. Firstly, at the developmental level, since it was\ndecided to conceive this new CALL project as part of a curriculum design process. For\nonce, CALL was not a late addition or an after-thought, but an important and\ncomplementary element entering the programme of study. In turn, this approach\nsupported the well-mastered drill and practice mode whilst creating new links to related\ntextual and multimedia Web resources. Similarly, by intrinsically linking CALL and\ncurriculum developments, members of the teaching staff, themselves potential authors,\nbecame involved in the design at an earlier stage in the process, thus facilitating a crucial\nexchange of ideas and objectives. By the same token, students, as end-users but also\ninterested parties, were also encouraged to participate in the formative phase of the design\nby giving the design team feedback on early prototypes of interactive exercises and mixed\nlearning interfaces, which were provided for this purpose on CD-ROMs. Therefore, staff\nand students were seen as partners or collaborators for this project and this protracted\ninvolvement both in the formative and in the summative stages of the process proved to be\nvery beneficial to the overall usability of the designed interface. Secondly, at the interface\nlevel, assimilation was linked to the ability to explore the CALL environment meaningfully,\nallowing the learner to anticipate, recognize, identify and acquire the relevant information.\nTherefore, it was related to the usability factor of the application as well as cognitive\noverheads it generated when interacting with it both at the operational level, with language\nexercises, and at the informational level, when used as language resource. Thus, although\nstudents were given full interactive control, the clear strategy and sheer variety of designed\ninteractions meant that motivation would be sustained and students more naturally\ninclined to be pro-active. Ultimately, it was hoped that, by increasing CALL's availability\nand integration into the students' experience, it would be possible to promote a flexible,\nnetwork-based, access mode encompassing and reconciling classroom access and use with\nself- and open-access exploitations.\nAuthoring\nIn parallel, the main findings from two surveys, an international survey carried out in 1991\n(Levy, 1997) and a London-based survey carried out in 1995 (Hemard, 1995), were used to\nsketch out an author profile and identify authoring needs to be supported by high-level\ndesign considerations. Initially, all respondents, including those without authoring\nexperience, indicated that CALL was suitable and could improve the language-learning\nexperience if properly integrated into the overall learning environment. Therefore,\nauthoring applied to the provision of grammar support mechanisms as well as a more\nconstructivist multimedia interaction.\n46\nALT-J Volume 8 Number I\nOf interest, the lack of general design expertise was felt to be detrimental and translated\nitself into poor design considerations, which made little or no mention of design potential\nin terms of expected student interaction, student requirements and the desired match\nbetween the task and the action domains. Similarly, Levy's survey focused on the way\nauthors conceptualized CALL in terms of strategies, roles, modes and scope (Levy, 1997).\nNot unlike the previous London-based results (Hemard, 1995), respondents were perceived\nas being notably 'eclectic' when selecting their preferred teaching and learning approaches,\nshowing a preference for communicative approaches whilst still supporting, although to a\nlesser extent, more formal, deductive methods. A similar range of responses was elicited on\nauthors' perception of the role the computer should play. Whilst split on the question, the\nmajority of respondents considered that the computer should play a non-directive role and\nsaw it fundamentally as a tool. Not surprisingly, directive roles such as manager of tasks,\nexpert system or surrogate teacher were the least favoured. Last but not least, respondents\ndid not seem to differentiate between roles and contexts of use making the computer,\nregardless of its role, suitable in both the self-access mode and the classroom.\nQuestions related to the design process showed that the majority of respondents had\ndifficulty in the pre-design, conceptualization phase favouring a lower-level, task-based,\nproblem-solving approach instead of a higher- level design process. Such widely differing\nviews also highlighted the wide range of authors involved in CALL design, from the\nlanguage teacher with no prior design expertise to authors conducting research and\nreviews, or developers. This last point was, indeed, corroborated by the general view,\nexpressed by respondents, that the role of the teacher as author was to be involved in\nCALL materials writing. Not surprisingly, therefore, the majority of responses showed the\noverwhelming domination of textuality in CALL indicating that the computer was still\nbest at enhancing reading, writing and text reconstructions with listening coming first\nfollowed by interactive video, interactive audio, simulation and finally speaking. Therefore,\nif CALL was considered appropriate, its multimedia applicability, in terms of hardware\ndelivery, language aspects and learning strategies, was not easily realizable. Above all, the\nauthoring dimension in CALL was focusing on another user group, formed by language\nteachers, who, on the whole, were driven by the overriding need to adapt and exploit CALL\nwith little or no design expertise and technical support.\nOn the strength of these characteristics, shared by many authors or would-be authors in\nforeign languages, high-level design considerations concentrated on specific design\nobjectives. Firstly, given that the usability of authoring interfaces had hardly been\naddressed previously (Nielsen, 1995), authoring became an important concept to consider\nwithin the environment to be designed for two essential reasons. On the one hand, the\ncreative language input needed to be authored by all relevant teachers regardless of their\nICT expertise and, on the other, teaching staff had to be involved in the design process in\nsome way if they were to be expected to integrate and use the finished interface in their\nteaching. Thus, an authoring tool extension had to be designed to provide content material\nbut also built-in flexibility and, above all, ownership. However, in order to avoid\nreinventing the authoring wheel with its known technological pitfalls, and on the strength\nof existing evidence, it was decided that the only way to win over recalcitrant language\nteachers was to identify and, above all, separate both authoring input and function. On\nsuch a premise, the specificity of the authoring tool was to enable teachers to author in\n47\nDominique Hemard and Steve Cushion Authoring a Web-enhanced interface for a new language-learning environment\ntheir own language material in their known word-processing environment, delivering data\nwhich were then to be deciphered and translated into programmed interactivity by the\nmachine-driven tool. Therefore, by dint of separating input from output, a simple, but\nversatile and powerful, authoring tool, requiring no specific authoring skills, could cater\nfor and support the realistic needs of all language teachers, who, at long last, would feel\ninvolved and, by extension, motivated into exploiting CALL. To date, this device\ndeveloped in Java provides this built-in intuitive authoring approach to design gap-filling\nand substituting exercises, interactive tables of verbs, listening exercises, multiple choices,\nword identification, text jumbling and a glossary writer mode.\nConclusion.\nThe advent of the Internet providing increased access, recognition and realizable inter-\nactive potential, coupled with the attraction generated by cutting-edge technology, can\nsignificantly benefit CALL if properly harnessed. It is to be hoped that, by having focused\nspecifically on the theoretical basis supporting the design process and highlighted\nprojected usability both at the level of students and language-teaching staff, this paper will\nbe instrumental in helping CALL to shed its tarnished reputation and enter a new\ndevelopmental phase.\nReferences\nBainbridge, L.
