Introduction \nThis chapter provides a comparative assessment of the environmental issues \nsurrounding the geological disposal of carbon dioxide (CO2) and radioactive waste. \nThese are diverse and influence the entire disposal chain including transport and the \nFinal published version at \nhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/earth+sciences+and+geography\/geology\/book\/978-90-481-8711-9 \n  \n 2 \nconstruction and operation of facilities. However, the issues considered here are post-\nclosure, that is after the closure of a radioactive waste repository or after CO2 \ninjection has ceased and the site has been formally closed. Consideration will be made \nof both terrestrial and marine environments although, for radioactive waste, the focus \nis mainly on terrestrial environments.   \n \nIn carbon capture and storage (CCS), the injection of CO2 into a geological formation \nis known as \u201estorage\u201f although there is no intention to retrieve the CO2 once it has \nbeen injected. This is also the case for radioactive waste because it is generally \nenvisaged that waste emplacement, or \u201edisposal\u201f, at depth is permanent, though there \nmay be a long phase of active management prior to the decision to initiate repository \nsealing and closure. However, both radioactive waste and most CO2 could be \ntechnically retrieved.  \n \nRadioactive waste includes all waste materials that are too radioactive for disposal \nwithin an ordinary landfill facility. This will include wastes derived from nuclear \npower generation, including fuel reprocessing, medical wastes and laboratory wastes. \nIt may also include naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM) such as scale \n(removed from the inside of oil pipelines) which is naturally radioactive. It will \ninclude some long-lived Low Level Wastes (LLW), Intermediate Level Waste (ILW) \nand High Level Waste (HLW) and could include Spent Nuclear Fuel (SNF) and \nplutonium and uranium if these materials are considered to be waste. Most LLW is \ndisposed of to surface or shallow disposal facilities and is not considered further here. \nCO2 streams will comprise almost pure CO2 captured from large point sources such as \nfossil-fuel based power stations, cement and some chemical and refinery plants. \n \nFor both technologies, post-closure environmental concerns focus on the impacts of \neither unpredicted releases of radionuclides or leakage of CO2 into the biosphere \nwhich includes the shallow subsurface (the soil, vadose zone and potable aquifers); \nand surface ecosystem. Performance Assessment (PA) (described in the chapter by \nMaul (this volume)) is usually used to evaluate the (post-closure) evolution of \nrepository systems with some of the output expressed in terms of risk to human health \nand the environment. PAs provide a rigorous and comprehensive approach to site \nFinal published version at \nhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/earth+sciences+and+geography\/geology\/book\/978-90-481-8711-9 \n  \n 3 \nappraisal and, in the context of project planning and regulatory decision making, they \nare crucial in developing the long term \u201esafety case\u201f which, for the geological disposal \nof radioactive waste, is commonly extrapolated over a period in the order of 10\n6\n years \n(e.g. NIREX 1997). Currently, formal PA is not implemented in existing CO2 storage \nprojects because the technology is still evolving from the research and development \nstage. However, guidelines are being developed for the risk assessment of CO2 \nstorage such as the Convention for the Protection of the marine Environment of the \nNorth-East Atlantic (OSPAR) Guidelines for Risk Assessment and Management of \nStorage of CO2 streams in geological formations (OSPAR 2007); and the European \nCommission\u201fs (EC) draft directive on the geological storage of carbon dioxide (see - \nhttp:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/environment\/climat\/ccs\/eccp1_en.htm. Accessed 27 April 2009) or, \nat an earlier stage, Strategic Environmental Assessments (SEA) which compares \ndifferent management strategies. Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) are \nundertaken in both technologies and these give \u201ean evaluation \u2026   \u2026 (of) impacts of a \nproposed activity, where the performance measure is overall environmental impact, \nincluding \u2026 \u2026 global measures of impact on safety and the environment\u201f (IAEA, \n2003). Thus EIAs have been used for construction and operational phases where, for \nexample, physical and ecological effects are being evaluated. However, EIAs in the \noil and gas industry, on which CO2 storage practice is based, are normally concerned \nwith environmental impacts during construction, operation and decommissioning and \nhave not necessarily been used to consider potential impacts over the long term. \nSeveral CO2 storage demonstration projects have also included an element of long-\nterm risk assessment (e.g. Weyburn, Canada (Zhou et al. 2004; Stenhouse et al. 2005); \nGorgon, Australia (Gorgon Joint Ventures (GJV) 2005a.b) and Schweinrich, Germany \n(Svensson et al. 2005). \n \nWhen examining the environmental issues surrounding radioactive waste disposal and \nCO2 disposal, several criteria need to be examined. These include: \n The characteristics of  radioactive waste and CO2; \n The potential environmental impacts of radioactive waste and CO2; \n Assessment of the hazards arising from radioactive waste and CO2; \n Monitoring of environmental impacts. \n \nFinal published version at \nhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/earth+sciences+and+geography\/geology\/book\/978-90-481-8711-9 \n  \n 4 \nThe environmental issues for the two technologies are discussed in the following \nsections with particular emphasis on these criteria. A comparative assessment is then \nmade, using the above criteria, highlighting similarities and differences between the \ntwo areas. The conclusions from these comparisons are then discussed in terms of \nfuture research and policy. \n2. Geological Storage of Carbon Dioxide \u2013 Environmental \nIssues \n \n2.1. International regulatory background \nGlobally, emissions of CO2 from fossil-fuel use in the year 2000 totalled about 23.5 \nGt with 60% attributed to large (>0.1 Mt CO2 yr\n-1\n) stationary emission sources such \nas power stations, cement production and refineries (IPCC 2005). Clusters of these \nsources are found in North America, Europe, East Asia and South Asia and a variety \nof mitigation strategies, including carbon capture and storage (CCS), will be required \nto reduce CO2 emissions from these sources. \n \nTo date, the major projects demonstrating CO2 capture and storage (CCS) at Weyburn, \nCanada (Wilson and Monea 2004) and Sleipner, in the North Sea (Torp and Gale \n2002) have particularly focussed on technological and economic viability, and \nwhether these sites could leak. Consequently, these studies are focussing on \nmonitoring, verification and risk assessment \u2013 it is intended that such work will assist \nregulators and reassure other stakeholder groups (especially the public) that the sites \nwill not leak. These projects operate within existing oil and gas regulatory \nframeworks. At Weyburn, for example, injection of CO2 is used to enhance oil \nrecovery from an existing oil field. However, if CCS is conducted outside \nhydrocarbon-related operations these existing regulations may not be appropriate. \n \nAt the time of writing, the regulatory frameworks governing geological CO2 storage \nare being developed (described in the chapter by Wilson and Bergan (this volume)). \nIn general, current projects are licensed under petroleum legislation. However, \nOSPAR has provided guidance on the steps it requires before geological storage in \nreservoirs at depth below the seabed can be allowed in marine jurisdictions of \ncontracting parties (OSPAR 2007). Further, a draft EC Directive enabling European \nFinal published version at \nhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/earth+sciences+and+geography\/geology\/book\/978-90-481-8711-9 \n  \n 5 \nMember States to enact legislation of the regulation of CCS is currently under \ndiscussion (see - http:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/environment\/climat\/ccs\/eccp1_en.htm. Accessed \n27 April 2009). However, within these draft regulations, it is recognised that issues of \nleakage and potential long-term stewardship must be addressed if the potential for \nCO2 capture and storage to provide substantial reductions in atmospheric CO2 \nemissions is to be realised (Mace et al. 2007; Zakkour and Haines 2007). Additionally, \nstudies on public perception of CCS (see, for example, Shackley et al. 2004) indicate \nconcerns about the effect of leakages on the environment.   \n2.2. Environmental impacts of CO2  \nIt can be assumed that storage sites will be selected to \u201cpermanently\u201d store the \ninjected CO2. However, if leakage from storage sites did occur after formal closure of \nthe injection site, it could be over small areas from discrete point sources, such as \nabandoned wells, resulting in locally high concentrations of CO2. This could reach \ntens of percent levels in soil gas (West et al. 2005); well above any background levels \nand which will impact on organisms (Table 1). Although extensive physiological \nresearch is available, the overall environmental impacts of localised elevated CO2 \nconcentrations on terrestrial, subsurface and marine ecosystems are still poorly \nunderstood and, as a result, are areas of active research (see following section).   \n \nEssentially, respiratory physiology and pH control are the primary physiological \nmechanisms controlling responses in organisms to elevated CO2 exposures.  \nInformation is available from a diverse research base and some examples are given in \nTable 1. These data, however, are mostly from studies on organisms exposed to either \nslightly elevated concentrations of CO2 or the high concentrations that give a lethal \nresponse.  \n \nINSERT TABLE 1  \n \nIn economic terms, leaks from a storage site into marine and freshwater systems \nmight affect fisheries by altering pH with accompanying physiological effects (Turley \net al. 2004). For terrestrial systems, leakages might damage crops, groundwater \nquality and\/or human and animal health. Other concerns include acidification, \nchanges in biological diversity and species composition, and asphyxiation at high CO2 \nFinal published version at \nhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/earth+sciences+and+geography\/geology\/book\/978-90-481-8711-9 \n  \n 6 \nconcentrations. In addition, biogeochemical processes may be affected as increased \nCO2 concentrations could change pH, microbial populations and nutrient supply. It is \nalso important to understand the local effects in comparison to global increases of \nCO2 concentrations on the environment and habitats. In contrast to studies of the \neffects of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations (say a rise from current levels to \n550 ppm), levels of CO2 in soils resulting from leaks from engineered storage sites \nunderground could be enhanced by several orders of magnitude above atmospheric \nlevels causing damage or, in the worst case, serious damage to an ecosystem. \n \nOrganisms close to a leakage could be exposed to acute and perhaps lethal \nconcentrations whilst those at increasing distances from the leakage could be exposed \nto firstly acute and then to chronic concentrations. How such exposures will influence \nan existing ecosystem as a whole, or the individual species within an ecosystem is \nunknown and further work is required to obtain a better understanding. Thus for all \necosystems of interest, the potential indicator groups at the different trophic levels \nneed to be identified and effects determined.  At an economic level, it can be \nenvisaged that particular concern will lie with certain key receptors. For example, in \nmarine environments key fishery groups and their food sources may be specific target \nreceptors, whilst in terrestrial systems these may include humans and crop plants. \nHowever, such key receptor groups should not be seen in isolation because they will \ninteract with other species within an ecosystem.   \n \nCO2 leakage could also affect subsurface and surface biogeochemical processes by \nchanging, for example, pH and possibly redox conditions. CO2 mobilisation of trace \nmetals is also a common geological process, albeit typically on long timescales and at \nslow rates. The potential for heavy metal mobilisation via leaking CO2 has been \nproposed by several authors (e.g. Kharaka et al. 2006) though, as yet, little direct \nevidence from analogue systems has been obtained. It is also important to consider the \nimpact of potential environmental impacts resulting from impurities (such as H2S, \nSO2 and NOx) that may be present in leaking CO2. Such changes could have \nsignificant implications for groundwater quality in terms of acidification of supplies \nand possible dissolution of minerals and mobilisation of heavy metals. Little work has \nbeen undertaken in this area, although Onstott (2005) and Stenhouse et al. (2009) \nFinal published version at \nhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/earth+sciences+and+geography\/geology\/book\/978-90-481-8711-9 \n  \n 7 \nhave undertaken some preliminary modelling work. H2S is a toxic gas and as such \nposes a hazard to humans and is closely regulated. H2S, SOx and NOx could, if they \nwere co-transported within a leaking CO2 plume, alter pH and redox conditions in the \nsoil environment, which could result in changes in nutrient supply, microbial and \nplant diversity and habitats (International Energy Agency \u2013 Greenhouse Gas Research \nand Development Programme (IEA-GHG) 2004).  \n2.3. Current Research \nAt the time of writing, several projects are underway to examine the environmental \nimpacts of CO2 leakage into both terrestrial and marine systems. CO2GeoNet is a \nEuropean Network of Excellence (http:\/\/www.co2geonet.com. Accessed 27 April \n2009) for geological storage of CO2 involving 13 partners. Some of its research \nactivities have focussed on studying the ecosystem responses to natural CO2 leakages \nat sites in Italy and Germany (e.g. Beaubien et al. 2008, Kr\u00fcger et al. 2009) and a \ngeneric system model is also being developed (described in the chapter by Maul (this \nvolume) and in West et al. 2006). Field sites are also being developed to study \nimpacts of CO2 leakage on agricultural crops (Artificial Soil Gassing and Response \nDetection (ASGARD) site, Nottingham, UK - West et al. 2009; and see \nhttp:\/\/www.nottingham.ac.uk\/geography\/asgard\/. Accessed 27 April 2009); and to test \nmonitoring technologies and models (Zero Emission Research and Technology Center \n(ZERT) site, Montana, USA - Spangler et al. 2009; and see \nhttp:\/\/www.montana.edu\/zert\/index.html. Accessed 27 April 2009). Specific work is \nalso being undertaken on the impacts of CO2 leakage on marine systems by the \nResearch Institute of Innovative Technology for the Earth (RITE), Japan with \nCO2GeoNet partners (Ishida et al. 2006) and by Plymouth Marine Laboratory (PML), \nUK (Turley et al. 2004). However, all these projects are in their early stages with only \nlimited results currently available. \n2.4. Gaps in knowledge \nAs detailed above, no explicit acknowledgement or guidance is available in any \nexisting regulations on the release and environmental impacts of CO2 from terrestrial \nand marine storage sites. Additionally:  \nFinal published version at \nhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/earth+sciences+and+geography\/geology\/book\/978-90-481-8711-9 \n  \n 8 \n No indicator species for specific ecosystems have been identified. While to \nsome extent ecosystems will be site specific, basic supporting research on \ngeneric processes is still needed to build confidence.  \n No data on total ecosystem responses to a CO2 leak and their recovery times \nare available. \n No specific data are available on the potential impacts on groundwater or \nsurface water quality. Though the potential for CO2 mobilisation of trace \nmetals, other gases and hydrocarbons has long been recognised, little data \nhave been generated. \n Co-transported and -injected species have received little attention so far but \ncould include low to trace concentrations of O2, SO2, NO, H2S, CO, Hg, Cd, \nAr, N2, H2O, and NH3.  Hg and Cd are likely to be at ppb levels (Aspelund and \nJordal 2007 and references therein). Many of these potentially co-injected \ngases (e.g. O2, SO2, H2S) are biogeochemically important and could alter \nmicrobial populations either in the reservoir, or if released with CO2, in the \noverburden and near surface environment. We are not aware of any research \nthat has determined the fate of co-injected species during CO2 storage.   \n Few data exist on impacts on the soil environment from high concentrations of \nCO2 emerging from depth. \n There is currently a lack of integration between considerations of potential \nimpacts of CO2 leaks on terrestrial and marine ecosystems and PAs. EIAs \nhave traditionally been used to assess the impacts of engineering schemes over \nthe lifetime of the project, which have included legacy issues such as site \nabandonment, clean-up, remediation and liability following the end of the \nproject. However, CO2 storage projects present new challenges because of the \nvery long timescales that need to be considered after the injection project has \nfinished, particularly when considering performance. \n3. Geological disposal of radioactive waste \n3.1. International regulatory background \nRadioactive wastes comprise less than 1% of total industrial toxic wastes with a total \narising of 81,000 m\n3 \nyr\n-1\n (~210 kt yr\n-1\n) of conditioned wastes in the Organisation for \nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries (McGinnes 2007). The \nFinal published version at \nhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/earth+sciences+and+geography\/geology\/book\/978-90-481-8711-9 \n  \n 9 \ncomposition and characteristics of radioactive wastes vary and a recent summary of \nwaste classes defined by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is given in \nTable 2. In countries which use nuclear power, roughly 90% of the volume is LLW \ncontaining 1% of the total radioactivity, 7% is ILW with 4% of total radioactivity and \n3% is HLW, containing 95% of the radioactivity (McGinnes 2007).   \n \nINSERT TABLE 2 \n3.2. Environmental impacts of radionuclides in radioactive wastes \nRadioactive waste contains radioisotopes of a wide range of elements which will emit \nalpha, beta, gamma and neutron radiation. While minimal shielding will protect \npeople and the environment from alpha and beta radiation, external exposure to high \nlevels of gamma radiation or neutrons is harmful and can be fatal to some species, \nincluding humans. Internal exposure to alpha or beta radiation sources, for example \nthrough inhalation or ingestion, is also harmful at high levels and can be fatal in \nserious cases. Some radioactive elements are also chemically toxic. Additionally, \nsome radioactive wastes also contain chemically toxic materials, such as lead from \nshielding but these are not considered further here. \n \nThe nature of radioactive elements means that their impacts on organisms are very \ncomplex. Moreover, interpretation of data is further complicated by the debate \nsurrounding the relationship between radiation dose and subsequent biological \nimpacts. As a result, it is not possible to produce a definitive summary of the impacts \nof radionuclides on organisms (as has been given for CO2 in Table 1). \n \nRadioactivity is easily measured and controversy exists as to whether it is harmful at \nlow levels. Even in regions with naturally high background radiation (e.g. uranium \nore deposits in Africa (Bowden and Shaw 2007) and Brazil (Chapman et al. 1992), it \ndoes not necessarily have any identifiable effect on the surface environment or local \nplant, animal or human populations. Following the Chernobyl accident in April 1986 \na large amount of work has been undertaken in evaluating the environmental impact \nof the disaster including monitoring the response of the natural environment to \nradiation exposure (IAEA 2005). Within the 30 km exclusion zone, localised sites of \nacute adverse effects on animals and plants have been recorded in areas of higher \nFinal published version at \nhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/earth+sciences+and+geography\/geology\/book\/978-90-481-8711-9 \n  \n 10 \nradiological exposure. However, no adverse effects have been reported in plants and \nanimals exposed to a cumulative dose of less than 0.3 Gy absorbed dose during the \nfirst month following the accident (IAEA 2005).  \n \nIn order to isolate higher activity radioactive waste from the environment, most waste \nmanagement organisations are proposing geological disposal of these wastes in deep \n(greater than 200 m) repositories. Wastes will be conditioned and emplaced in \nengineered barrier systems designed to minimise radionuclide migration, within a \nsuitable geological environment which will isolate the waste for an extended period of \ntime. In most geological settings it is inevitable that there will eventually be some \ndispersion of the radionuclides from the repository, but this will be very slow and \noccur only in the distant future, when the hazard from the waste has been \nconsiderably reduced by radioactive decay. The processes in the engineered and \ngeological barriers will reduce mobility of the majority of any radionuclides that \n\u201eescape\u201f ensuring that only a small fraction will ever reach the near surface and \nsurface environments. Additionally, their dispersion will ensure that they only \ncontribute a small fraction to the doses received by plants and animals, including \nhumans, when compared to doses received from natural radiation sources.  \n \nThe IAEA specify that the annual dose to a member of the public from a closed \ngeological repository in the future should not exceed 0.3 mSv (IAEA 2006). This \ncompares to the global annual average effective dose from natural background \nradioactivity of 2.4 mSv (United Nations Committee on the Effects of Atomic \nRadiation (UNSCEAR) 2000). However, regulators in many countries require a target \nmore stringent than 0.3 mSv. For example, for land-based disposal of radioactive \nwaste, the UK environmental agencies have defined that the assessed radiological risk \nto an individual of developing a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary defect should be \nless than one-in-a-million per year (Environment Agency (EA) 2009). This compares \nto the 1 in 100,000 per year risk constraint suggested by the IAEA Safety \nRequirement of 0.3 mSv and the 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 10,000 as a result of exposure to \nnatural background levels (2.23 mSv (Watson et al. 2005)) in the UK. Thus the \naccepted dose from a repository in the UK is between one hundred and one thousand \nFinal published version at \nhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/earth+sciences+and+geography\/geology\/book\/978-90-481-8711-9 \n  \n 11 \ntimes below the radiological risk to which members of the population are exposed as a \nresult of natural background radiation levels.  \n \nStudies of natural and anthropogenic analogues provide information on the impacts of \nenvironmental exposure to radiation; how radionuclides behave over geological time \nscales; and an understanding of how the materials used in a radioactive waste \nrepository are likely to perform in the long term. Examples of work include the \nimpacts of exposed\/near surface uranium mineralisation on the local habitat (Needles \nEye, Scotland; Po\u00e7os de Caldas, Brazil) (Miller et al. 2000) and the behaviour of \nreactor products in the geological environment produced by a natural reactor 2 billion \nyears ago (Oklo, Gabon) (Miller et al. 2000). Such studies are important in helping to \npredict the future performance of a repository and also have a significant role in \npromoting confidence in the wider stakeholder community that a repository will \nprovide the intended isolation of the waste. \n3.3. Examples of current work \nSignificant effort has been directed over many years, particularly by national waste \nmanagement programmes, into designing waste packaging and the engineering of a \nrepository and its backfill to ensure optimum retention of the radionuclides within the \nrepository; understanding the processes by which radionuclides may eventually be \nreleased from a repository and how they may migrate or be retained within the \ngeosphere (Alexander and McKinley 2007). Extensive databases on their potential \nimpact on reference plant and animal species and on humans in various uptake \npathways have also been compiled (International Commission on Radiological \nProtection (ICRP) 2007).  \n \nMany studies are site specific, relating to particular waste types in defined geological \nenvironments. Other studies are generic and are aimed at understanding, for example, \nthe processes that may be involved in radionuclide migration. Considerable \nexperimental work is also being undertaken in several underground research facilities \n(including \u00c4sp\u00f6 (Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Company - SKB, \nSweden), Bure (Agence nationale pour la gestion des d\u00e9chets radioactifs - ANDRA, \nFrance), Grimsel and Mt Terri (National Cooperative for the Disposal of Radioactive \nWaste - NAGRA, Switzerland) and Mol (Belgian Nuclear Research Centre  - \nFinal published version at \nhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/earth+sciences+and+geography\/geology\/book\/978-90-481-8711-9 \n  \n 12 \nSCK\u2022CEN, Belgium)) into how repositories in different rock types will perform \nduring operational and post-closure phases. This is supported by extensive work on \nnatural analogue systems (Miller et al. 2000). Examples of other recent work includes \nthe palaeohydrogeological studies carried out under the European Union EURATOM \nfunded EQUIP (\u201eEvidence from mineralogy and geochemistry for the evolution of \ngroundwater systems during the Quaternary for use in radioactive waste repository \nsafety assessment\u201f) and PADAMOT (\u201ePalaeohydrogeological data analysis and model \ntesting\u201f) projects (Degnan and Bath 2005) that included mineralogical studies to \nelucidate the impacts of glaciations on groundwater systems. Ongoing research is \nexamining the role that microbial activity, including biofilms, has in retarding or \nenhancing radionuclide migration through different geological environments (Coombs \net al, 2009). The Large Scale Gas Injection Test (Lasgit) experiment in the \u00c4sp\u00f6 \nUnderground Research Laboratory (Harrington et al. 2007) is studying bentonite \nsaturation and gas migration though the bentonite backfill of a full scale deposition \nhole. \n3.4. Gaps in knowledge \nCompared to CCS, radioactive waste disposal is a relatively mature science with a \nfifty year history (Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology (POST), 1997; \nMcKinley et al. 2007). During this time significant advances have been made in \nunderstanding and assessing the long-term performance of a repository. Appropriate \nsites will be selected to allow radioactive wastes to be disposed of with confidence \nthat the impacts on the near surface and surface environment will be minimal over \nvery long time periods; in fact much more securely than we currently dispose of many \nother wastes, some of which are also highly toxic (Savage 1995). Radioactive waste \ndisposal is also highly regulated, ensuring that it is undertaken safely and \nappropriately. \n \nHowever, there are still some issues that are not fully understood and which additional \nresearch will clarify and permit more robust predictions to be made on repository \nbehaviour and overall performance. For the purposes of this chapter, it is relevant to \nnote that these include: \n Gas generation within a repository and its subsequent migration through the \nengineered systems and into and through the geological environment; \nFinal published version at \nhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/earth+sciences+and+geography\/geology\/book\/978-90-481-8711-9 \n  \n 13 \n Understanding the processes that may help to reduce the mobility of \nconservative isotopes, such as \n14\nC, in the repository and geological \nenvironments and thus mitigation to reduce their migration can be introduced;  \n Further understanding of the processes of the migration of radionuclides at the \ninterfaces between the repository and the surrounding geosphere (the rocks in \nwhich the repository is sited) and the geosphere and the biosphere (the plants \nand animals, including humans, in the near surface and surface environment). \n4. Technology Comparison  \nHaving described the environmental issues surrounding both technologies, it is now \npossible to make comparisons between them using the criteria outlined in the \nintroductory section above. These are also summarised in Table 3. \n \nINSERT TABLE 3 \n \n4.1. Characteristics of radioactive waste and CO2 \nThe nature, composition and volumes of the two wastes are very different, as detailed \nin previous sections, and thus are important considerations for environmental impacts. \nRadioactive waste is toxic at high concentrations and much is long-lived, with the \nhighest activity material being so radioactive that heat generation is a real issue when \nconsidering handling, storage and disposal. Thus the appropriate management of \nwaste is required to ensure the safety of workers, the general public and the \nsurrounding environment because of the radiation emitted. However, not all \nradioactive waste has the same level of potential hazard to the environment and so \nclassification of waste makes it easier to determine how they can be handled and helps \nto identify suitable disposal options (Table 2). Additionally, repositories often have \nindividual limits for specific radionuclides which are defined as part of the licensing \nof facilities. Waste inventories are also very well defined. The production of \nradioactive wastes is not limited to nuclear power generation but is generated \nwherever radioisotopes are used (e.g. nuclear medicine, military applications, \nresearch). Additionally, the use of raw materials such as rocks, soils and minerals \ncontaining NORM in certain industrial activities can concentrate their natural \nradioactivity e.g. oil pipeline scales, soap manufacture from phosphate. \nFinal published version at \nhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/earth+sciences+and+geography\/geology\/book\/978-90-481-8711-9 \n  \n 14 \n \nIn comparison, CO2 is a non-radioactive, naturally occurring gas, asphyxiating at \nhigher concentrations, which is being emitted into the atmosphere in huge volumes. \nCO2 waste streams from many sources, particularly power plants, will probably also \ncontain impurities. There is considerable uncertainty in the estimates of volumes of \nthese impurities although it is important to note that some, for example H2S, are in \nthemselves toxic. Thus, in contrast to radioactive waste, the specifications of some \nCO2 streams have yet to be clearly defined. \n4.2 Environmental impacts of radioactive waste and CO2 \nImpacts from the disposal facilities \nThe relatively low volume of radioactive waste produced by the nuclear industry \nmeans that it can be managed and disposed of in relatively small, usually national \nfacilities; and the understanding and regulation of environmental issues can be \nsimilarly constrained. Both surface and underground infrastructure will be required to \nensure isolation of the wastes. In contrast, CO2 storage facilities will be numerous and \nprobably large-scale. Surface infrastructure will be needed for injection with \nassociated transport facilities. Consequently, evaluating post-closure performance will \nbe more diverse and challenging, particularly in terms of environmental issues. \n \nFor radioactive waste disposal, it is important to recognise that all repository designs \nuse an engineered multi-barrier system approach and these barriers, in themselves, \ncan alter the surrounding host rock environment. An example is the generation of a \nhyper-alkaline plume from a repository containing cementitious materials, which will \nalter the mineralogy and porosity of the surrounding rock. Because of radioactive \ndecay, radioactive wastes become progressively less radioactive with time and, within \na million years of its removal from a reactor, spent fuel is less radioactive than the \nuranium ore from which it was made (Chapman and Curtis 2006). If disposed of in a \ndeep geological repository it is likely to be much more isolated from the near surface \nenvironment by the intervening strata and so have much less environmental impact \nthan the original ore deposit, many of which lie near the surface. For vitrified HLW, \nwhich has had the potentially valuable long-lived uranium and plutonium removed by \nreprocessing, the reduction to natural uranium ore deposit levels of radioactivity is \nwithin a few thousand years (Chapman and Curtis 2006). \nFinal published version at \nhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/earth+sciences+and+geography\/geology\/book\/978-90-481-8711-9 \n  \n 15 \n \nWith the exception of the well completions, no engineered barriers will be used for \nCO2 storage and, as a result, it is possible for the CO2 to change the environment both \nchemically (alteration of groundwater conditions though CO2\/rock interactions) and, \nin extreme cases, physically. However, the degree of risk to the environment from \nCO2 leakage from the geological environment will significantly reduce with time \nfrom the end of injections, as a combination of initially physical (such as residual \ntrapping and pressure decreases) and subsequent chemical trapping mechanisms \nbecome more effective e.g. chemical reactions with minerals (Benson 2005; \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2005). \n \nImpacts of leakages on biological systems \nRadiation, from whatever source, represents a potential danger to biological systems \nand hence to the environment. The actual danger from radioactive waste depends on \nmany factors such as the nature of the radionuclides in the waste and the type and \nenergy of the radiation emitted; its rate of exposure and the type, age and health of the \nreceiving receptor (usually human). At high radiation exposures, death will occur \nwithin months or less; at moderate levels, radiation exposure increases the chance that \nan individual will develop cancer; at lower levels the cancer risk decreases although \nthe relationship between cancer risk and the magnitude of exposure is unclear. In \norder to minimise and control these risks, national radiation protection agencies have \nissued rules with legal force on dose limitations and limits of intake of radioactivity as \nwell as guidelines for working with radioactive substances. The International \nCommission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) regularly publishes recommendations \nand guidelines and is currently considering a framework for assessing the impact of \nionising radiation on non-human species. In this framework the ICRP proposes the \nuse of \u201ereference animals and plants\u201f because there is now an increasing need to \ndemonstrate, directly and explicitly, that the environment is being protected even \nunder planned radiation exposure situations (see draft report at - \nwww.icrp.org\/draft_animals.asp. Accessed 27 April 2009).   \n \nAlthough it is an asphyxiant at high concentrations, CO2 has a fundamental role in the \nglobal biogeochemical cycle which is well recognised. This chapter has identified \nFinal published version at \nhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/earth+sciences+and+geography\/geology\/book\/978-90-481-8711-9 \n  \n 16 \nsome of the impacts of elevated CO2 on the environment in the context of CO2 storage. \nHowever, no equivalent of the ICRP exists and no guidance is currently available on \nthe release and environmental impacts of CO2 from terrestrial and marine storage sites. \nNo \u201ereference animals and plants\u201f have been identified and, indeed, little information \nis available on total ecosystem responses to a CO2 leak and their recovery times. \nConsequently, the scientific understanding of the environmental impacts of CO2 \nleaking from a storage site, which is needed to assist in the development of regulatory \nguidelines, is not yet fully understood. \n4.3 Assessment of the hazards arising from radioactive waste and \nCO2 \nRadioactive waste inventories vary and, consequently, so does the radiological hazard \nand the duration of that hazard. Thus any particular repository design will need to \nreflect the nature of the radioactive wastes to be emplaced, and the associated hazard. \nFor example, waste will be emplaced in a matrix which will provide a stable waste \nform that is resistant to leaching and gives slow rates of radionuclide release for the \nlong-term. This will be decades for less hazardous LLW but will need to be up to \nhundreds of thousands of years for very hazardous HLW. In contrast, although CO2 \ncould be mixed with impurities on injection, it is only hazardous in high \nconcentrations. However, this hazard will remain constant at higher concentrations.  \n \nThe risks of leakage of CO2 from a geological storage site to the environment can be \nclassified as either global or local. Global risks involve the release of CO2 that may \ncontribute significantly to climate change if there is a large leakage from a geological \nformation into the atmosphere \u2013 although this risk should be compared to that arising \nif there is no storage. This risk, although low, is higher during the injection phase \nwhen reservoir pressures are highest. With regard to local risks, these include sudden \nand rapid CO2 leakage from an injection well or from abandoned wells; or gradual \nleakages through undetected faults, fractures, caprock or leaking wells. Risks of this \ntype of leakage are higher early post-closure before other trapping mechanisms reduce \nthe mass of buoyant CO2. Consequently, much emphasis is placed on assessing post-\ninjection performance, before formal closure. Leakage from a post-closure radioactive \nwaste repository would also be a local risk to the environment and would include \nunpredicted failure of the engineered barriers coupled with subsequent migration of \nFinal published version at \nhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/earth+sciences+and+geography\/geology\/book\/978-90-481-8711-9 \n  \n 17 \nradionuclides through the host rock. While unlikely, much work has been undertaken \nto evaluate and manage risk of leakages from radioactive waste repositories using low \nprobability\/high consequence scenarios, particularly in the context of PA and the \nrepository \u201esafety case\u201f; and a similar holistic system model approach is now being \nproposed for CO2 (described in the chapter by Maul (this volume)). \n \n4.4. Monitoring environmental impacts \nMonitoring is an important aspect of the development and operation for both \ntechnologies and will also provide confidence in successful containment of the wastes \nStenhouse and Savage 2004). It will be important to obtain baseline information on \nthe undisturbed site and, for environmental impacts, it will be crucial to obtain near-\nsurface and surface data using a variety of ecological, chemical and physical \nparameters. Subsequent operational and post-injection monitoring data can then \nprovide meaningful inputs to assessments.  It is unlikely that there will be \nradionuclide releases from a repository soon after closure because of the engineered \nbarrier system so surface monitoring will be relatively unimportant and is dependent \non regulatory requirements. However, the integrity of the geological containment of \nCO2 may be tested soon after closure because there are no engineered barriers in place, \nas is the case for a radioactive waste repository. A range of standard protocols would \nbe needed to undertake effective environmental monitoring for CO2 and these are \ncurrently being developed. Environmental monitoring is likely to become less \nimportant with time as retention processes become more important. However, the \ndecision on when to cease monitoring of any kind will be one that can only be made \nwhen the necessary regulatory framework is in place.   \n5. Conclusions  \nGiven the discussions and comparisons above, several key points emerge which can \nbe summarised in two general areas: Science and Policy. \n5.1. Science \nBoth CO2 and radioactive waste can be hazardous to a wide range of organisms \nalthough their effects on life processes are very different. Much is known about \nradiological effects on organisms.  In contrast, little is known about the effects of CO2 \nFinal published version at \nhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/earth+sciences+and+geography\/geology\/book\/978-90-481-8711-9 \n  \n 18 \nleakages from a storage site on ecosystems and subsurface environments and this is \ncurrently an active area of research. \n \nThe volume of radioactive waste is very small when compared to CO2 emissions from \nstationary sources. Consequently, the numbers and relative sizes of radioactive waste \nrepositories and CO2 storage sites will be very different. Moreover, this means that \nradioactive waste management and disposal can be tightly constrained. Additionally, \nrepositories are usually considered as national facilities whereas CO2 storage projects \nare often considered to be regional in nature. Currently, most CO2 emissions from \nstationary sources are directly into the atmosphere with no management \u2013 effectively \nthis means that there is 100% leakage. If CCS is to be a successful mitigation \ntechnology, then it will be crucial to demonstrate that the environmental impacts of \nthe technology, particularly in the long-term, are acceptable when compared to those \nof global warming. \n \nRadioactive waste repositories use an engineered multi-barrier approach for \ncontainment and these barriers can alter the environment. In contrast, CO2 storage \nrelies on the integrity of the geological environment for containment and this is likely \nto be tested early post-closure. Additionally, the CO2 itself will also alter the \ngeological environment. Consequently, it will be important to develop protocols for \nmonitoring environmental changes as a result of CO2 leakage. Methods will be \nneeded for monitoring the shallow subsurface, ecosystems and reference organisms. \n \nMuch work has been undertaken to evaluate and manage risk of leakages from \nradioactive waste repositories, particularly in the context of PA and the repository \n\u201esafety case\u201f and much can be learned from this considerable experience. A similar \nsystem model approach is now being proposed for CO2 (described in the chapter by \nMaul (this volume)). This will help to ensure a systematic approach to assessing \nenvironmental impacts for any CO2 storage site. \n5.2 Policy \nThe criteria that a radioactive repository must satisfy for long-term, post-closure \nsafety are very well defined internationally.  Currently, no similar specific regulatory \nframework for geological CO2 storage is in place (described in the chapter by Wilson \nFinal published version at \nhttp:\/\/www.springer.com\/earth+sciences+and+geography\/geology\/book\/978-90-481-8711-9 \n  \n 19 \nand Bergan (this volume)) although it is recognised that leakages to the environment \nmust be addressed.  Currently, most EIAs for existing CO2 storage projects under \nexisting oil and gas regulations have focused on the operational period, but it is \nincreasingly recognised that long-term performance will form a critical component \nwhen assessing potential environmental impacts and site liability issues.  Although the \ntwo technologies are different, an examination of the approaches used for regulating \nradioactive waste repositories could be very useful for the development of the CO2 \nstorage regulatory framework. \n \nRegulators will also require information on impacts of CO2 on \u201eyet to be defined\u201f \nreference organisms in order to establish appropriate threshold and safety criteria.  \nRecovery rates will also need to be defined.  Additionally, the impacts on \ngroundwaters will need to be assessed. \n \nIn conclusion, it is worth noting that many countries around the world continue to \nface difficulties with implementing programmes for geological disposal of radioactive \nwaste.  Technically speaking, although geological disposal is well understood and \nregulated, the general public has concerns and fears about the long-term safety of a \nrepository which focus on the effects of leaks on human health and the environment.  \nClearly without addressing these concerns, the implementation of waste disposal \nprogrammes will continue to flounder and this is now being recognised by the nuclear \nindustry.  Recent studies of the public\u201fs perception of CCS have revealed the same \nconcerns about the effects of leakages of CO2 from a storage site on the environment \n(as described in the chapter by Reiner and Nuttall (this volume) and by Shackley et al. \n2004). The radioactive waste disposal experience strongly suggests that it is crucial \nthat these perceived CO2 leakage concerns are addressed if the technology is to gain \npublic acceptance and be successfully implemented.  \n6.
