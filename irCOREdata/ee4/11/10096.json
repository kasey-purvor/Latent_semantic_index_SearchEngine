Darnley, MB, BS\nAbnormal approach and escalation from communication to physical intrusion are central concerns in managing risk\nto prominent people. This study was a retrospective analysis of police files of those who have shown abnormal\nattentions toward the British Royal Family. Approach (n\u0001 222), compared with communication only (n\u0001 53), was\nsignificantly associated with specific factors, most notably serious mental illness and grandiosity. In a sample of\nthose who engaged in abnormal communication (n\u0001 132), those who approached (n\u0001 79) were significantly more\nlikely to evidence mental illness and grandiosity, to use multiple communications, to employ multiple means of\ncommunication, and to be driven by motivations that concerned a personal entitlement to the prominent\nindividual. Logistic regression produced a model comprising grandiosity, multiple communications, and multiple\nmeans of communication, for which receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis gave an area under the curve\n(AUC) of 0.82. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to those for other target groups.\nJ Am Acad Psychiatry Law 38:329\u201340, 2010\nAbnormal contacts with prominent people take two\nbroad forms, as do stalking and harassment of any\ngroup: communications and physical intrusions, in-\ncluding approach. Approach is a behavior of partic-\nular concern in the protection of public figures, in\npart because it is a necessary prerequisite to attack,\nthe ultimate fear of those so targeted. Base rates of\nattack, however, are very low.1 Other much more\ncommon, yet important, reactions that inappropri-\nate approach occasions in public figures are those of\nembarrassment, inconvenience, and distress or fear\nin the prominent persons, their families, colleagues,\nand those charged with their protection. Additional\nconsequences are the disruption of events and the\nwaste of resources in expensive policing responses.\nFactors associated with approach have therefore be-\ncome a subject of study in the risk-assessment\nliterature.2\nA second, related and arguably more prominent\nconsideration in the assessment of risk, is that of\nescalation\u2014that is, whether those engaging in ab-\nnormal communications are likely to attempt to ap-\nproach the prominent person in a physically intrusive\nmanner.\nThe relatively few published studies in this area3\u20139\nwere conducted in the United States and examined\nthe experiences of politicians, the judiciary, or celeb-\nrities. Studies of approach and escalation in stalking\nof the general public are limited to that by McEwan\net al.10 The current study concerns the United King-\ndom and, rather than politicians or the general pub-\nlic, addresses abnormal communications and ap-\nDrs.

Its\ngoals were to establish the characteristics of those\nwho approach; to determine the factors that differ-\nentiate them from people who limit their activities to\ncommunications; to ascertain which factors are asso-\nciated with escalation from communication to ap-\nproach; to consider the differences between those\nwho approach after communicating and those who\ngive no such warning of their inappropriate interest\nbefore approaching; and last, to compare these re-\nsults with those in previous studies concerning ap-\nproach and escalation in general population, politi-\ncian, and celebrity samples.\nMethod\nSample Selection\nThis study was undertaken as part of the Fixated\nResearch Project, financed by the United Kingdom\nHome Office (interior ministry). It concerned a ret-\nrospective analysis of cases drawn from a pool of\n5,702 files compiled by the Royalty Protection Divi-\nsion of the Metropolitan Police Service over a period\nof 15 years (1988\u20132003) on individuals who had\nmade abnormal or inappropriate communications or\napproaches to members of the Royal Family. An ab-\nnormal or inappropriate communication was an at-\ntempt to communicate by letter, e-mail, telephone,\nor facsimile, when it went beyond normal interest.\nIncluded in this group were those whose communi-\ncations stood out because of their content\u2014the bi-\nzarre, incomprehensible, unrealistic, threatening,\nsexual, or persistent\u2014and those communications\nthat stood out because of their form, such as writing\nin blood or including odd enclosures. An approach\nwas an inappropriate attempt to achieve proximity to\nmembers of the Royal Family, a royal residence, or\nroyal event. Such approaches were qualitatively or\nquantitatively different from the actions of Royalty\nfans and included odd or threatening behavior in\nroyal locations and attempts, successful or otherwise,\nto breach security cordons at royal residences or royal\nengagements.\nThe raw material from which the data were ex-\ntracted comprised both police files in paper form and\na computerized police intelligence record. The latter\nwas organized on an incident rather than person ba-\nsis. The format necessitated printing out 20,000 in-\ncident records and sorting them manually into ma-\nterial relating to specific individuals. The process of\ndata extraction was conducted by two fulltime re-\nsearch workers (a psychiatrist and a clinical psychol-\nogist) and took two years. A preliminary pilot project\nwas undertaken with 500 cases, to aid in the refine-\nment of themethodology and the construction of the\nfinal dataset.\nThe 5,702 files were separated into groups accord-\ning to the type of behavior in which the individuals\nhad engaged. A stratified random sample was drawn\nfrom the file pool by using a random number gener-\nator until approximately 50 cases had been selected\nfrom each behavioral group. The study sample com-\nprised 275 cases, which formed the basis for the con-\nsideration of behavior and mental state. Of these, 53\nengaged in communications only, 53 engaged in\ncommunication and approach without breaching se-\ncurity, 58 engaged in approach without breaching\nand without having first communicated, 54 at-\ntempted to breach but were unsuccessful, and 57\nwere successful in breaching. In 26 of these 275 cases,\ninsufficient information was available to reliably sep-\narate them into motivational groups. These cases\nwere excluded from analyses involving motivational\ngroup, which were performed on a sample of 249\ncases. For all the other variables examined in the ta-\nbles in this article, the completeness of data ranged\nfrom 95.3 to 100 percent, unless otherwise stated.\nData Extraction\nA 125-item data sheet was completed on each case\nand the data points entered into an SPSS database,\nwith an automatic reader used to reduce the likeli-\nhood of transcription errors. The data gathered con-\ncerned sociodemographic information, and details of\nbehavior, mental state, and motivation. A strict def-\ninition of serious illness was used. Its presence was\nrecorded if any of the following were in evidence:\nobviously testable delusions; thought disorder, as il-\nlustrated in written material or recorded verbal out-\nput; clear evidence of abnormal perceptions (e.g.,\nhearing voices), or evidence of passivity phenomena.\nSerious mental illness was also recorded as present\nwhen the files contained clear documentary evi-\ndence, taken from hospital records, of an ICD-1011\ndiagnosis of F20 or F21-29. (The ICD classification\nis that used by the National Health Service in the\nUnited Kingdom for diagnostic returns on all patient\ncontacts.) With regard to motivation, the cases were\nallocated to eight groups, produced through earlier\nstudy of the file pool.1,12 The motivations of the\nAbnormal Attentions to the British Royal Family\n330 The Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law\nsubjects were determined through the content of\ntheir writings and the explanations they offered to\npolice when stopped. Where more than one form of\nmotivation appeared to be present, the most promi-\nnent was selected. The motivational categories are\ndescribed in the results section below. Other terms\nare defined where they first occur.\nStatistical Analysis\nTo determine differences between groups on cat-\negorical variables, analyses were performed by using\nPearson\u2019s chi-square (\u00012) where the appropriate as-\nsumptions were met. Where assumptions were vio-\nlated, Fisher\u2019s exact tests were used. Odds ratios were\nalso calculated. Independent t tests were used for\ncomparing the ages of groups.\nEffect sizes were also calculated for each measure\nof association, because the group sizes in some of the\nanalyses performed were uneven and some were rel-\natively small, thus reducing power and increasing the\nprobability of making Type II errors (i.e., failing to\ndetect existing relationships). The use of effect sizes\nenabled interpretation of the data beyond, and inde-\npendent of, the information provided by p values,13\nproviding further indications as to the strength of\nassociations. The measure of effect size used was the\nphi coefficient (\u0002).14\nMultivariate logistic regression was undertaken,\nwith individual predictors selected for the regression\nequation if their univariate association was signifi-\ncant (significant odds ratio and chi-square significant\nat p \u0002 .2515). Receiver operating characteristic\n(ROC) curve analysis was used to ascertain the dis-\ncriminatory power of the full logistic regressionmod-\nels and subsequent improper models. The area under\nthe curve (AUC) in a ROC analysis is taken to indi-\ncate the probability that a randomly selected case\nfrom the group in question will have a greater num-\nber of predictors included in the model than a ran-\ndomly selected case not in the group in question (i.e.,\nthe true positives as a function of the false positives,\nor sensitivity as a function of 1 \u0003 specificity). An\nimproper model16,17 is one in which the weights as-\nsigned to variables are obtained by a nonoptimal\nmethod. In the present study, all were made equal to\n1, to overcome some of the traditional limitations of\nmultiple regression. By setting the weights equal to 1\nand retaining only the direction of the relationship to\nthe criterion variable, the influence of sample-spe-\ncific variance is reduced, and the model may have\ngreater applicability outside the originating\nsample.16,17\nMultiple Testing\nThe study involved the analysis of a library of files,\nin which we examined parameters suggested by the\nliterature. However, the purpose of the exercise was\nan exploration of possible associations, rather than\nthe testing of hypotheses. As such, multiple testing\nwas used. No corrections to significance values were\nincorporated to compensate for multiple testing. In\nconsequence, conclusions drawn from p \u0004 .01\nshould be treated with caution.\nData Quality Assurance Checks\nFormal testing was undertaken of the reliability of\ncase behavioral type and classification of motivation\nby using Cohen\u2019s \u0003. Determination of case type\nshowed 92 percent concordance (\u0003\u0001 0.80) and mo-\ntivation showed 81 percent concordance (\u0003\u0001 0.77).\nThe most frequent discordant pairing was between\ncases categorized as chaotic (described later) and\nthose in which there was insufficient information to\ndivine a motivation.12\nEthics\nThe project concerned retrospective consideration\nof police files, with anonymization of data. It did not\ninvolve any access to medical files or health service\ninformation systems. It did not involve any contact\nwith the subjects, or any form of intervention. The\nresearch group operated within the relevant ethics\nframeworks determined by the HomeOffice and the\nMetropolitan Police Service, the sponsor and host of\nthe study, respectively.\nResults\nApproach\nThose who approached were separated from the\nstudy sample (n \u0001 275) and their characteristics es-\ntablished. They were then compared with those who\ndid not approach. Of the approach cases (n\u0001 222),\n70 percent involved males. The mean age was 39.1\nyears (SD, 12.8). In the first of eight motivational\ngroups were 31 percent who had delusions of royalty;\nthese persons either believed that they were members\nof the Royal Family or that they themselves were the\ntrue sovereign. In the second group were the 11.7\npercent who were intimacy seekers; these either har-\nbored erotomanic delusions of a reciprocated rela-\nJames, Meloy, Mullen, et al.\n331Volume 38, Number 3, 2010\ntionship with a member of the Royal Family, or they\nwere offering love or marriage with absolute confi-\ndence that they would succeed in their suit. The third\ngroup comprised the 18.8 percent who were amity\nseekers, subjects who made offers of friendship,\nwhich they expected to be accepted, apparently\noblivious to the unrealistic nature of their aspiration.\nGroup four were the 3.0 percent who believed that\nthey were victims of organized persecution by the\nRoyal Family. The fifth group comprised the 6.6\npercent who were querulants, people who were pur-\nsuing highly personalized quests for justice and vin-\ndication. They wanted either to recruit royal assis-\ntance with their claims or to complain of royal\nindifference to their causes. The sixth group con-\ntained the 7.6 percent whowere seeking help or sanc-\ntuary, usually by requesting royal protection from\nsupposed persecutors. The seventh group were the\n7.1 percent who wanted to act as counselors, a group\nof individuals who saw it as their role to offer advice\nand directions to the Royal Family as to how the\nFamily should live their lives and who expected their\nadvice to be taken. Finally, the eighth group com-\nprised the 14.2 percent whowere chaotic, individuals\nwhose thought processes and behavior were so dis-\nturbed as to make a singularity of purpose unlikely.\nThese eight groups represented the eight motiva-\ntional types.11\nApproachers (n \u0001 222) were significantly more\nlikely than nonapproachers (n \u0001 53) to show overt\nevidence of serious mental illness (i.e., psychosis) (\u00012\n\u0001 9.169; p\u0001 .002;\u0002\u0001 0.183;OR\u0001 2.88; 95%CI,\n1.422\u20135.813); to be deluded (\u00012\u0001 9.557; p\u0001 .002;\n\u0002\u0001 0.186; OR\u0001 2.571; 95%CI, 1.397\u20134.739); to\nbe grandiose (\u00012 \u0001 20.390; p \u0001 0.000; \u0002 \u0001 0.272;\nOR \u0001 4.329; 95% CI, 2.217\u20138.403); and to show\ndelusions of royalty (\u00012 \u0001 7.894; p \u0001 .005; \u0002 \u0001\n0.178; OR \u0001 3.436; 95% CI, 1.395\u20138.475). Ap-\nproachers were less likely to be rambling or incoher-\nent (\u00012 \u0001 14.050; p \u0001 .000; \u0002 \u0001 \u00030.226; OR \u0001\n0.315; 95% CI, 0.170\u2013.587) and less likely to be\ncounselors (\u00012 \u0001 16.187; p \u0001 0.000; \u0002 \u0001 \u00030.255;\nOR \u0001 0.206; 95% CI, 0.092\u20130.471).\nEscalation\nThe sample for considering escalation excluded\nthose cases in which there was an approach, but no\ncommunication. It comprised 53 cases in which\ncommunication was not followed by approach, 53\ncases in which it was followed by approach that did\nnot involve breaching activity, and 26 cases in which\nit involved breaching activity. The total sample in-\ncluded 132 subjects.\nThe statistical results from this section are detailed\nin Tables 1 and 2. Significant associations in the table\nare summarized in the text, giving only the odds ratio\n(OR), with more details set out in the tables.\nForm of the Communications\nOf the 132 communicators, 94.7 percent engaged\nin writing. Nearly half (49.1%) of those who com-\nmunicated without approaching did so more than\nonce, 7.5 percent telephoned, and 17.0 percent\nwrote other prominent persons as well as the Royal\nFamily.\nAmong the communicators, those who ap-\nproached were significantly more likely to have en-\ngaged in certain behaviors than those who did not\napproach. Of those, 78.8 percent made multiple at-\ntempts to communicate (OR 3.9), 27.8 percent tele-\nphoned (OR 4.72), 25 percent used more than one\nmode of communication (OR 8.5), and 32.5 percent\nsent communications to other prominent persons as\nwell as the Royal Family (OR 2.4).\nThere were differences within the approach group\nbetween those who had attempted or succeeded in\nbreaching security barriers (breach activity) and\nthose who had not. Of those who wrote to the Royal\nFamily and other prominent individuals, 26.4 per-\ncent were nonbreachers and 42.3 percent were breach-\ners. The first of these statistics is not significantly differ-\nent from that for the communicators who did not\napproach, but the breach activity group is significantly\ndifferent from the nonapproachers (OR 3.6). There\nwere no significant differences in the number of cases in\nwhich the letters had enclosures.\nLanguage of the Communications\nDefinitions concerning language content were\ntaken from Scalora et al. (Ref. 8, pp 37\u20138). Subjects\nwere considered to have used threatening language if\nthey described a desire to harm or have harm occur to\nthe target in either a direct or veiled fashion. Subjects\nused demand language if they made either vague or\nspecific demands of the target, regardless of the re-\nquest\u2019s level of rationality.\nOf those who only communicated, 15.1 percent\nused threatening language, 24.5 percent used demand\nlanguage, and 17.0 percent used abusive language.

Of the\napproachers\/communicators who did not engage in\nbreach activity, only 3.8 percent used abusive lan-\nguage (OR 0.19). Of those approachers\/communi-\ncators who engaged in breach activity, 11.5 percent\nused abusive language, but the difference from the\nnumber of those who communicated without any\napproach did not reach significance.\nOverall, 10 percent of all approachers\/communi-\ncators used threatening language, a lesser proportion\nthan among those who did not approach, but not\nsignificantly so. Only 1.9 percent of those not engag-\ning in breach activity made threats, significantly\nfewer than those who limited their activities to com-\nmunication (OR 0.11). In contrast, the proportion\nof those engaging in breach activity who used threat-\nening language was greater than that of the nonap-\nproaching communicators (23.1% vs. 15.1%), al-\nthough the difference did not reach significance. In\nother words, those who threatened in their commu-\nnications were significantly less likely to engage in\nsimple approach, but this was not the case with those\nwho made attempts to breach security barriers.\nContent of Communications\nAngry or hostile themes were present in 32.1 per-\ncent of the communicators. In those who ap-\nproached without breaching, the proportion was 9.4\npercent which was significantly lower (OR 0.22).\nHowever, in the group of those who communicated\nand engaged in breach activity, the proportion of\nangry content (34.6%) was by contrast slightly\nhigher than in the group of those who communi-\ncated without approaching (32.1%).\nThere were no significant differences between\ncommunicators and communicators\/approachers on\nany of the other content items recorded: amorous\nfeelings, sexualized content, seeking help, offering\nhelp, or being rambling or incoherent.\nMental State\nOf those who communicated but did not ap-\nproach, 69.8 percent showed evidence of major men-\ntal illness, 45.3 percent delusional beliefs, and 26.4\npercent grandiosity (Table 2).

Two groups were\nsignificantly less likely to engage in any form of ap-\nproach: those whose motivation was to offer advice\nand guidance to the Royal Family (counselors; OR\n0.23) and the chaotic (OR 0.26).\nThose who believed themselves to be persecuted\nby members of the Royal Family formed a very small\nproportion of all the cases in the combined sample, as\ndid querulants (4.6%). Intimacy seekers accounted\nfor 13.2 percent of those who communicated only\nand 20.0 percent of those who approached as well\n(NS).

This analysis has potential impor-\ntance in threat assessment, because preventing inap-\npropriate approach equates with reducing the levels\nof threat to Royal Family members.\nThree motivations together accounted for 71.8\npercent of cases in which communicators went on to\napproach: those with delusions of royalty, amity\nseekers, and intimacy seekers. The first two groups\nwere significantly more likely than the remainder of\ncases to escalate to approach. All three groups com-\nprised persons with a particular sense of entitlement\ntoward the royal individual, whether through per-\nceived blood ties, love, or friendship, a quality de-\nscribed by Meloy et al.18 as entitled reciprocity: the\nperson\u2019s belief that he is owed a debt of gratitude, or\nat least contact, by the public figure because of his\ndevotion. In contrast, those who saw their role as offer-\ning counsel to the royal personagewere significantly less\nlikely to have a need to press their advice in person, and\nchaotic letter writers were also less likely to approach\nthose to whom they had written. The other motiva-\ntional groups accounted for only small proportions of\nletter writers, whether they approached or not, except\nfor the help seekers. In that group, there is an indication\nthat the type of approach may vary according to moti-\nvation,12 as 13.5 percent of those who approached\nwithout breach activity were seeking help, but none of\nthose who chose to breach security cordons or barriers.\nMost important, angry and hostile themes occurred in\nnearly five times as many of the communications in the\ngroup of those who engaged in breach activity than in\nthe communications of the group of those approachers\nwho did not.\nMajor mental illness and evidence of delusional\nbeliefs were strongly associated with approach, being\nalmost ubiquitous among approachers\/communica-\ntors, although also present in most of the simple\ncommunicators. Grandiosity was a central factor in\nthis type of behavior and appeared in the regression\nmodel predicting approach, while mental illness and\ndelusional beliefs did not. Indeed, the one factor of\nwhether grandiosity was present correctly predicted\nnearly three-quarters of the communicators who\nwent on to approach and a similar proportion of\nthose who did not. Such grandiosity is congruent\nwith the motivations that accounted for most of the\napproacher cases. The findings concerning grandios-\nity provide some empirical support for the theory of\nJames, Meloy, Mullen, et al.\n337Volume 38, Number 3, 2010\nMeloy19,20 of narcissistic linking fantasies, conscious\nbeliefs that one has a special and idealized relation-\nship with another. Grandiosity, of course, is not self\nconfidence, but rather the disparity between the facts\nof the subject\u2019s life and the sense of his own impor-\ntance. In many cases, grandiose fantasies compensate\nfor real-life failures in both work and love. Grandi-\nosity is one facet of pathological narcissism, an aspect\nof personality that is quite apparent in most stalk-\ners.19,21 It complements entitlement in the sense that\nthe subject\u2019s demands remain concordant with his\nexpansive sense of self. Why would he not be entitled\nto see the Queen when his importance required it? It\nis also noteworthy that the grandiosity in most of our\nsubjects passed the threshold of delusion, wherein\nconsensual reality, even quirky consensual reality, is\nreplaced by a private, idiosyncratic, and, in some\ncases, bizarre internal fantasy.\nDietz and Martell3 similarly found that any gran-\ndiose delusion appeared in 60 percent of all their\nsubjects who inappropriately communicated to ce-\nlebrities, and 44 percent demonstrated an excessive\nsense of self-importance or uniqueness. Most salient\nwas their finding that those who approached celebri-\nties were significantly more likely (\u00012 \u0001 4.85, p \u0002\n.03) to evidence an excessive sense of self-importance\nor uniqueness (52%) than those who did not ap-\nproach (36%). Although this finding did not emerge\nin the Dietz et al.5 study for the U.S. Congress, if the\nsubject took a special constituent role, it predicted an\napproach (46% vs. 16%, \u00012 \u0001 7.77, p \u0001 .0053).\nSuch self-identification also hints at pathological\nnarcissism and perhaps grandiosity.\nNearly 80 percent of those who went on to ap-\nproach had written more than once, and more than\n25 percent had telephoned. More than 40 percent of\nthose who engaged in breach activity had written to\nother prominent people as well as members of the\nRoyal Family, a form of target dispersion.8 These\nsignificant findings reflect those problematic con-\ntacts with another group of prominent people in an-\nother country: members of the U.S. Congress, as\nreported by Dietz et al.5 and Scalora et al.7,8 Ap-\nproach behavior appears to be associated with more\nintrusive forms of attempted communication, mul-\ntiple means of communication, and target dispersion,\nperhaps all measuring a more energized individual\nwherein the pathological fixation is fuelled by both in-\ntense affect and desire, usually psychotically driven.\nThe logistic regression model showed that the\npresence of three factors (grandiosity, multiple com-\nmunications, and multiple means of communica-\ntion) correctly predicted 77.5 percent of cases of es-\ncalation (sensitivity) and 69.8 percent of cases in\nwhich it did not occur (specificity). The tradeoff be-\ntween sensitivity and specificity in the construction\nof the model is represented in the AUC, which at\n0.82 indicates good discriminatory power. That the\nimproper model differs little from the substantive\nmodel indicates that the model may have wider ap-\nplicability than simply to the originating sample. In\npractical terms, the presence or otherwise of the three\nfactors in the model provides an initial indication of\nthe risk of escalation which will then be supple-\nmented in the individual case by scrutiny for idio-\ngraphic factors associated with increased or decreased\nrisk. The power of the single-factor model compris-\ning grandiosity alone suggests that this factor can be\nused as a rapid initial screen.\nComparison with Stalker Samples\nFew stalker studies or reviews have touched on the\ntopic of approach,22,23 and there has been little at-\ntention paid to escalation. The exception in this re-\nspect is the Melbourne group, who examined a co-\nhort of 211 stalkers for associations of approach and\nexcalation (McEwan T, MacKenzie RD, James DV,\net al: Approach and escalation in stalking: a study of\nassociations. Manuscript submitted.).The cases were\ndivided into two groups according to whether the\nstalker was an ex-intimate or not. This was in part to\nallow comparison with public figure samples. In the\nsample of 140 non ex-intimate cases, approachers\nwere significantly more likely than nonapproachers\nto be psychotic (p\u0002 .01, OR\u0001 3.85; 28.6% of non\nex-intimate approachers were psychotic and 87.5%\nof the psychotic approached) and to be intimacy seekers\nin the Mullen et al.21 typology (p\u0001 .03, OR\u0001 3.94).\nIn this sample of non ex-intimates, factors associated\nwith escalation from communication to approach were\npsychosis (p\u0002 .01, OR\u0001 5.31) and being an intimacy\nseeker (p\u0002 .01, OR\u0001 9.76).\nThe finding in this general stalker sample concern-\ning psychosis is entirely consistent with the findings\nconcerning the Royal Family sample, in the analyses\nof approach and of escalation. The findings concern-\ning intimacy seekers are also very similar. The defi-\nnition of intimacy seeker in the Melbourne studies is\nwider than that employed in the current study, in\nAbnormal Attentions to the British Royal Family\n338 The Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law\nwhich it would be likely to include most amity seek-\ners and people with delusions of royalty. Delusions of\nroyalty were significantly associated with approach,\nand both amity seekers and those with delusions of\nroyalty were significantly associated with escalation.\nOverall, in both samples, approach and escalation are\nassociated with psychosis and a particular sense of\nentitlement to closeness with the individual who is\nthe focus of interest. The associations of approach are\nthe same as those for escalation, but the associations\nare more significant with escalation.\nStrengths and Limitations\nThe strengths of this study are that it is the first of\nits kind in the United Kingdom and that a random\nstratified sampling method was used, which allowed\nthe separation of approaches into different types. Its\nweaknesses include small samples in some of the\nsubanalyses. Other weaknesses are, for the most part,\nshared with other studies in this area: retrospective\nmethodology, use of police files, and the determina-\ntion of the case selection of the base sample by the\nchoice of cases referred to and taken on by the police.\nThis selection bias could have resulted in an overrep-\nresentation of mental illness, if such cases more easily\nattracted attention. Conversely, it is likely to have\nresulted in an under-recognition of troubling letters\nwhen the form and content were not obviously dis-\nturbed. This drawback applies in particular to the\nquerulant, of whom Glueck said:\n. . . in his writings . . . [he] frequently succeeds in conveying\nthe idea of being quite normal. Each isolated fact looks\nnormal enough to the casual observer. . . . It is only after a\nclose study of the entire life history, of the many fine shades\nof deviation from the normal that the man exhibits, that one\ndiscovers that his mind is very seriously affected indeed, and\nthat because of his plausibility he belongs to a rather dangerous\ntype of mentally diseased individuals [Ref. 24, p 129].\nThe data with regard to approaches are likely to be\nmore reliable and valid, in that observable behaviors,\nsuch as breaching security cordons, are open to more\naccurate recording. This likelihood is suggested by\nthe comparison of those who approached without\nwriting with those who wrote and approached. The\nlatter were significantly more likely to be deluded,\nfeel persecuted, and be grandiose and confused. They\nwere more likely to be fixated on a person (reflecting\nspecific motivational groups), less likely to behave in\nan intimidating manner on approach, and less likely\nto engage in breach activity.\nCertain of the less common motivational groups\nwere insufficiently represented in the study sample to\nallow conclusions to be drawn, and the manner in\nwhich the police file archive was amassed may have\nexcluded communications from those in some moti-\nvational groups whose outward expression of their\nconcerns appeared lucid and, at least superficially,\nrational. We single out the querulant, a group that\nhas been found to be of particular concern in other\nstudies conducted by our research group,11,25,26\nwhen violence or proxies for violence were the focus.\nThe fact that those in this sample who approached,\nbut were not recorded as having communicated be-\nforehand, differed in significant aspects from those\nwho communicated as well, may speak to the char-\nacteristics and apparent rationality of unrecorded\ncommunications, rather than reflect real differences\nin whether individuals have previously communi-\ncated or not. Study of this troubling groupwhomake\ninappropriate approaches without first communicat-\ning is likely to become more practicable with ad-\nvances in information technology and the more wide-\nspread adoption by correspondence offices of\ncomputerized logs of all communications, whether or\nnot these evoked concern. The matter is also compli-\ncated by the fact that troubling correspondence may be\nwritten to agencies or persons different from the one\nwho is eventually approached. It is necessary to consider\nprominent people (public figures) as one entity, and it is\nimportant that intelligence and threat assessment agen-\ncies avoid fragmentation into groups with too specific a\nfocus. Future studies of abnormal attention, whether to\nprominent persons, celebrities, or the general popula-\ntion, should oversample from the minority of cases\nconcerning fixation on a cause, as opposed to a per-\nson, to help elucidate the differences engendered by\nthis fundamental difference in motivation.\nConclusions\nOverall, we conclude that letter writers and com-\nmunicators who approach are more likely to exhibit\nmotivations that are associatedwith a particular sense\nof entitlement, to manifest grandiosity, and to have\nengaged in more intrusive, energized, and intensive\ncommunication (multiple times, multiple means)\nwith the target and others. The presence of anger and\nthe making of threats, while significantly less preva-\nlent in those who approach without attempting to\nbreach than in those who simply write, are in fact\nmost prevalent in those who engage in the breach\nJames, Meloy, Mullen, et al.\n339Volume 38, Number 3, 2010\nactivities11 that mark the endpoint of an approach\nfor a small minority of subjects. The results add to\nthe embryonic threat assessment evidence base and\nmay aid in focusing the intelligence-gathering of rel-\nevant agencies.\nThe associations of approach and escalation are\nsimilar to those of violent attack, in the prominence\nof psychosis.25,26 However, a major difference con-\ncerns the nature of the principal focus. In the cases of\nattack, the focus was fixation on a cause. With ap-\nproach and escalation, the principal focus is on the\nprominent person and the idealized, usually delu-\nsional relationship that the subjects believe that they\nhave (or soon will have) with them. This difference\nindicates that different domains of risk to the prom-\ninent will have different associations, a phenomenon\nalready observed in the general stalking literature.21\nThis point leads to a wider notion about the stalking\nliterature. Our study adds to the evidence that abnor-\nmal attention to prominent individuals involves fac-\ntors similar to those of stalking persons in the general\npopulation, once ex-sexually intimate partners are\nexcluded from the stalking sample. A convergence of\nresearch on stalking in general and abnormal atten-\ntion to the prominent is desirable. Such a conver-\ngence of research effort requires the use of common\ndefinitions and a common typology. The latter\nwould best be constructed around underlying moti-\nvating emotional drives or desires,19 rather than de-\nscriptions of behavior or delusional content. A stan-\ndardized and manualized approach to the\nconceptualization and assessment of risk, both in\ngeneral stalking and prominent person harassment,\nhas recently been produced.27 This approach could\nbe useful as a common framework and definitional\nstandard around which future risk research exercises\nin these fields could coalesce.\nAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful to Troy McEwan and Michael Davis for statis-\ntical advice, and to RachelMacKenzie andTroyMcEwan for access\nto their stalking database.\nReferences\n1.
