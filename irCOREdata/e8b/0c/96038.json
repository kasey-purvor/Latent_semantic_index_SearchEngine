In many ways this \nprocess is a natural corollary of the fact that researchers must always adapt and sensitize \nthemselves to the realities of their field locations, and more importantly, the inherently \ndialogical nature of ethnographic research. At the same time, this \u2018construction\u2019 can \npotentially have more singular ramifications, particularly when fieldwork is carried out in \nsituations characterised by chronic violence. In such circumstances, the ethnographic process \nalmost inevitably exposes the anthropologist to violence, but can also become intrinsically \nimbued with violence, to the extent that it can make sense to talk of the \u2018violence\u2019 of \nethnography. This article illustrates this idea through a consideration of the author\u2019s doctoral \nfieldwork experiences in Managua, Nicaragua, including his ritual initiation into an urban \nyouth gang, and considers some of the ethical and practical ramifications of this experience. \n \nKey words: Ethnography, gangs, Nicaragua, violence, youth \n \nAcknowledgements: I am grateful to G.

This is arguably particularly the case in contemporary Central America, where \nlevels of violence are equivalent or higher than they were during the wars that affected the \nregion during the 1980s, despite these having been formally brought to an end during the \nearly and mid-1990s (Pearce, 1998: 589-90). Yet this paradoxical situation notwithstanding, \nthere is a significant dearth of in-depth research on post-conflict violence in Central \nAmerica,2 and more specifically on the youth gang phenomenon that is one of its key features \n(Arana, 2001; Rodgers, 1999). This state of affairs is undoubtedly largely due to the practical \ndifficulties involved in investigating such a topic. This applies to quantitative research insofar \nas it is hampered by the generalised paucity of reliable statistical data,3 but is perhaps most \nobvious in relation to qualitative research, and more specifically to the ethnographic enquiries \nthat are a particularly insightful element of social scientific scholarship on Central America. \nSuch studies are traditionally based on participant observation, a research method that \nattempts to capture the nature of social reality holistically by means of the researcher \nsimultaneously participating in and observing social acts, something that in violent social \ncontexts inevitably entails exposure to a range of potential risks. As a result, most \nethnographers \u2018select themselves out of [such] research\u2019, according to Jeff Sluka (1990: 124). \nWhile this may well often be the case, as Raymond Lee (1995: 1) remarks it is not as \nif ethnographers never \u2018work in settings made dangerous by violent conflict, or in social \nsituations where interpersonal violence and risk are common place\u2019. Indeed, Kevin Avruch \n(2001: 639) agrees that this is relatively frequent, but he also suggests that there is a \npropensity for resulting publications to ignore the methodological dimensions of their \nresearch.4 This article aims to make explicit some of the concrete practical, ethical, and \nepistemological dimensions of my research on Nicaraguan youth gang violence, highlighting \nin particular the way in which my ethnographic project was very much \u2018constructed\u2019 by the \nfield. While this is in many ways a natural corollary of the inherently dialogical nature of \nethnographic research, it is something that is arguably especially evident in situations imbued \nwith chronic violence, to the extent that it can actually make sense to talk of the \u2018violence\u2019 of \nthe ethnographic process in such conditions. I begin by tracing my initial encounter with an \nunexpectedly violent Nicaraguan social reality and discuss how it dramatically changed my \noriginal research plans, refocusing my investigations onto violence. I then go on to describe \nhow this led to my undergoing ritual initiation into an urban youth gang in a poor Managua \nneighbourhood, and concomitantly adopting certain violent behaviour patterns. The last \nsection of the article reflects the ethical and practical consequences of my actions. \n \n                                                          \n1 I am grateful to Jos\u00e9 Luis Rocha for graciously condoning my \u2018theft\u2019 of these two quotes (see Rocha, 2000). \n2 Two notable exceptions are Koonings and Kruijt (1999) and Moser and McIlwaine (2004). \n3 This is principally due to the difficulties of reliable data collection, the institutional weakness of post-conflict \nCentral American states, and the frequent \u2018massaging\u2019 of data for politically expedient reasons.  \n4 The excellent volume edited by Nordstrom and Robben (1995) is a notable exception to this state of affair. \n \n \n3 \n \nEncountering Nicaragua  \n \nIt has almost become a truism to say that ethnographers \u2018construct\u2019 the field in which \nthey carry out research. Less considered, however, is the way in which the field \u2018constructs\u2019 \nethnographers and the fieldwork process. Admittedly, it has always been a generally accepted \ntenet that the ethnographic encounter \u2018can never be subject to our firm control\u2019, and that \nconsequently having to adapt to unexpected circumstances is more or less \u2018standard \nprocedure\u2019 (Amit, 2000: 16). At the same time, however, Frank Pieke (1995: 76) contends \nthat such adaptation can frequently involve more than mere acclimatization to the unknown, \ninsofar as ethnographic research is a process that engages the ethnographer in \u2018a dialogue \nwith the entire social reality encountered\u2019. As a result, events that might not initially be \nconsidered germane to a research project can actively \u2018force\u2019 themselves onto the researcher. \nThis is what happened to him during his 1988-89 investigations in China, which originally \nconcerned state-led economic reforms but ended up focusing on popular political claims \nagainst the state as a result of the Tiananmen Square protests. This dialogical aspect of \nethnography can have particular ramifications for research conducted in violent social \ncontexts, to the extent that the ethnographic process can arguably become intrinsically \n\u2018violent\u2019, as the following account of some of my 1996-97 doctoral fieldwork experiences in \nNicaragua attempts to illustrate. \nI originally travelled to Nicaragua in July 1996 to conduct a year of ethnographic \nfieldwork for a doctoral project grandly entitled Songs of Life and Hope: Everyday Livelihood \nStrategies in the Barrios of Contemporary Urban Nicaragua. I had planned to investigate the \nmeans through which individuals and communities creatively organised themselves socially \nand culturally in order to cope with the profound economic crisis widely reported to be the \ndominant feature of the post-revolutionary Nicaraguan social reality (Nitlap\u00e1n-Env\u00edo team, \n1995). More specifically, I had hoped to study the solidarity and spontaneous co-operation \nthat I assumed would constitute the basis for such \u2018survival strategies\u2019 in Nicaragua, \nconsidering the profound influence the Sandinista revolution of the 1980s was alleged to have \nhad, my leftist political leanings and consequent belief in the inherent sociability of human \nbeings, as well as much of the wider anthropological literature on the organization of life in \nconditions of poverty.5 It quickly became apparent, however, that examples of collective \nsocial organization were few and far between. Traditional institutions of social solidarity such \nas the extended family or compadrazgo had shattered, Sandinismo was a highly tenuous \nmemory, and what I encountered instead of solidarity and collective action in the face of \ncrisis were social circumstances overwhelmingly characterized by fragmentation, apathy, and \ndisillusion (Rodgers, 2000). \nDeeply imbued with idealism as I was, my immediate response to this \u2018appalling face \nof a glimpsed truth\u2019 (Conrad 1990: 65) closely echoed Kurtz\u2019s reaction to his vision of human \nnature \u2013 \u2018The horror! The horror!\u2019 \u2013 in Joseph Conrad\u2019s famous 1902 novella Heart of \nDarkness, which I was reading at the time. Within days of my arrival I had cynically re-\nbaptized my research project Chants of Apathy and Nihilism, and descended into depression. \nAs intellectually traumatizing as this shattering of my na\u00efve personal convictions may have \nbeen, though, I am certainly not the first ethnographer to have found his or her preconceptions \nabout a society or even human nature to be wrong, and ultimately, this can be considered part \nand parcel of the uneasy process of fieldwork acclimatization. The discomfort that I felt was \nhowever rapidly compounded by a much more forceful imposition onto my being by \nNicaraguan social reality, namely through the active confrontation with violence in a way I \n                                                          \n5 Prominent examples of this literature on Latin America include Gonz\u00e1lez de la Rocha (1994), Lloyd (1979), \nand Lomnitz (1977), amongst others. \n \n \n4 \n \nhad never experienced before. Although post-Cold War Nicaragua is not as violent as its \nnotoriously brutal neighbours Honduras, Guatemala, or El Salvador, levels of violence have \nnevertheless risen dramatically during the past fifteen years, to the extent that veritable \npandemic levels prevail, particularly in poor urban areas. The talk and the fear of crime \npermeate everyday conversations, particularly regarding the pandillas, or youth gangs, that \nubiquitously roam the streets of urban neighbourhoods, robbing, beating, and frequently \nkilling, transforming large swathes of the country\u2019s cities into quasi-war zones, as they fight \neach other with weapons ranging from sticks, stones, and knives to AK-47 assault rifles, \nfragmentation grenades, and mortars (see Rodgers, 2006).  \nPerhaps not surprisingly, within a week of my arrival in Nicaragua, I was attacked at \nknife-point by a couple of pandilleros whilst walking in the streets, and less than a month \nlater, I was attacked again, this time at gun-point \u2013 or AK-47-point, to be exact \u2013 and robbed \nand collectively beaten up by a gang. Neither event was in any way enjoyable, nor am I \nashamed to say that I very nearly left Nicaragua after each attack. Beyond such \nconsiderations, however, these experiences are important to consider because they \nprecipitated an \u2018existential shock\u2019 (Robben and Nordstrom, 1995: 13), which profoundly \naffected my relationship with both my own self and with Nicaragua.6 Violence is a \npowerfully formative phenomenon, which shapes people\u2019s perceptions of themselves and how \nthey interact with their social and physical environments in the most immediate and urgent of \nmanners (see Feldman, 1991). Ethnographers are no exception, and these experiences caused \nme to shift the focus of my research from the survival strategies of the urban poor to the social \nexperience of violence.7 At one level this course of action could be construed as simply \nreflecting my personal fears, but I want to suggest that it can be better assimilated with what \nRaymond Lee (1995: 61) describes as \u2018involuntary research\u2019. The notion of \u2018involuntary \nresearch\u2019 is distinct from the better-known and commonsensical idea of \u2018accidental \nethnography\u2019 in that it implies the existence of an element of constraint. An involuntary \nresearcher is caught up in a situation from which he or she can neither escape nor ignore, and \nthereby inevitably has to study it even if he or she was not planning to. The most famous \nexample of involuntary research is probably Bruno Bettelheim\u2019s (1960) study of the Nazi \nconcentration camps in which he was incarcerated in 1938-39. The element of constraint \ninvolved in his research hardly needs pointing out, but Bettelheim also argued that he felt \ncompelled to observe and try to understand his own behaviour and that of others in the camp \nin order to avoid breaking down mentally. \nI am not claiming that my predicament was in any way equivalent to Bettelheim\u2019s. \nHowever, I believe that a conceptual analogy can be made with the idea of \u2018involuntary \nanthropology\u2019 to the extent that although I was not forced to go to Nicaragua, or even to stay, \nI found it impossible to leave once there. To a large extent this was due to a fear that \u2013 rightly \nor wrongly \u2013 my leaving the country would be interpreted as having \u2018failed\u2019 anthropology\u2019s \nultimate disciplinary test of fieldwork, as well as, it must be admitted, a certain pig-headed \n                                                          \n6 The \u2018shocking\u2019 nature of my encounter with violence was also related to the fact that nothing in my pre-\nfieldwork research (or my life up till then) had prepared me for these high levels of violence. In retrospect, most \nof the academic literature on Nicaragua published in the early 1990s was clearly based on research carried out \nduring the tail-end of the Sandinista era. Any commentary about the present tended to be an (often wishful) \nextrapolation of previous trends. The limited media reports that I could access at the time \u2013 the internet still \nbeing in its infancy and post-revolutionary Nicaragua having fallen off the Western media map \u2013 were no better, \nsuggesting that what little violence continued in Nicaragua was mainly rural and dwindling. \n7 I thus want to stress the fact that I did not go to Nicaragua with the intention of studying violence. In fact, had I \nknown beforehand that Nicaragua was as violent as it turned out to be, I would have likely chosen a different \ncountry in which to carry out my doctoral fieldwork. To this extent, I hope to pre-empt any putative accusations \nof \u2018personal adventurism\u2019 (Mahmood, 1996: 19) or \u2018thrill seeking\u2019 (Winlow et al., 2001: 537), that are \nfrequently levelled at those who study violence ethnographically. \n \n \n5 \n \nstubbornness (which some might less charitably consider excessive pride). Whatever my \nreasons, however, the fact that I felt compelled to remain meant that I found myself \ninescapably forced to structure my professional behaviour in particular ways. Even if it was \ntheoretically possible for me to persist with my original research project and latch onto one of \nthe rare manifestations of collective co-operation that continued to exist sporadically amongst \nthe Nicaraguan poor, the extent and impact of the ambient violence was such that I could \nneither ignore nor just passively suffer it if I wanted to truly enter into a \u2018dialogue\u2019 with \nNicaraguan social reality. To this extent, one can talk of the \u2018violence\u2019 of ethnographic \nresearch in situations of chronic brutality insofar as its inherently dialogical nature will force \nthe practitioner to turn their attention to violence, with all the risks this entails. At the same \ntime, however, there is also another sense in which the ethnographic process can be construed \nas violent. Perhaps not surprisingly, the fear of violence inscribed itself into the \noverwhelming majority of my actions. Ensuring my own security became a prevailing aim, \nand I structured both my personal and professional behaviours accordingly. This had \nconsequences that went beyond the mere pursuit of personal security, however, as the means \nthrough which I ended up carrying out my ethnographic research became themselves imbued \nwith violence, providing a different sense in which the ethnographic process can be violent, as \nthe next section details. \n \nJoining the gang and becoming a \u201cbroder\u201d \n \n I moved to barrio Luis Fanor Hern\u00e1ndez8 in mid-September 1996, in a rather \nserendipitous and even arbitrary manner. I had been renting a room in the home of a Managua \nuniversity professor since my arrival in Nicaragua two months previously, and had been \nspending my days unsuccessfully trying to find a poor neighbourhood with a community \norganisation that would accept to help me carry out my investigations. I would frequently \nreturn to my lodging after fruitless visits to poor barrios around the city and pour out my \nwoes to the professor\u2019s house-keeper, Do\u00f1a Yolanda Aburto G\u00f3mez. One day, she said, \n\u2018Dennis, why don\u2019t you come and see if my neighbourhood doesn\u2019t suit your needs? We\u2019re \nvery poor, and if you want, you can come and stay with me\u2019. The next day I went to visit her \nbarrio Luis Fanor Hern\u00e1ndez, and although the neighbourhood had no community \norganisation, it was indeed very poor. It was also reputedly a very violent barrio, and had a \nnotorious local pandilla, something that made me rather uneasy as the memories of my rather \nunpleasant encounter with a gang the month before were still rather fresh in my mind. I \nnevertheless decided to take Do\u00f1a Yolanda up on her offer, partly out of desperation, but also \nthinking that I would be living with somebody whom I trusted, and who would be able to \nprovide me with tips and perhaps even a modicum of protection. \nI made it my immediate concern on moving into the G\u00f3mez household to find out as \nmuch as possible about the local gang. My questioning of Do\u00f1a Yolanda however elicited a \nsomewhat limited \u2018yes, there is a pandilla, but don\u2019t worry about it\u2019, and since no further \ninformation seemed forthcoming, after a couple of days hanging about the house, I reluctantly \ndecided to initiate my fieldwork proper, and rely on my common sense in order to avoid a \nnasty encounter. In time-honoured anthropological manner, and despite my stomach\u2019s \ninsistence on dissolving into itself, I set about my ethnographic enterprise by spending \nsubstantial amounts of time idling in the barrio streets, hoping to engage in conversation with \nsomebody. For two days, I engaged in a solitary contemplation of barrio life, but on the \nmorning of the third day a youth called Julio came up to me and asked me for a cigarette, \nwhich I promptly supplied. We then chatted for a while about where I was from, and what I \n                                                          \n8 A pseudonym, as are all the names of people and places mentioned in this article. \n \n \n6 \n \nwas doing in the barrio, until a sudden downpour of rain curtailed this preliminary \ninteraction. Although I did not know it at the time, this was my first interaction with the local \npandilla, for Julio later turned out to be one of its more prominent members.  \nOver the next couple of weeks, I would get together regularly with Julio, as well as \nsometimes Miguel, Jairo, Pedro, and Jader, who also all turned out to be pandilleros. We \nwould sit on the curb side, sometimes talking animatedly about almost anything, sometimes in \nsilence, but always communally smoking cigarettes which I provided. Conversations were \nobviously probing on the part of both parties, as we mutually tried to categorize each other. I \ndoggedly tried to confirm that they were members of the local pandilla, this much having \nbeen intimated to me by members of the G\u00f3mez family. They however strenuously denied the \nexistence of a pandilla in the barrio. Their own questions centred mainly around who I was \nand what I thought of a variety of subjects including drugs (no problem), the barrio (it\u2019s fine \nso far, I haven\u2019t been attacked), Nicaragua (violent), my recent experience being attacked by a \npandilla (which they identified for me as \u2018Los Rusos\u2019), and my research project (life in the \ncontext of poverty and violence). \nWhy did the pandilleros socialize with me? To a certain extent, there were obvious \naffinities, considering my age \u2013 23 at the time \u2013 and gender, insofar as gang members in \nNicaragua are mainly young men,9 and also considering the strictures of Nicaraguan \nmachismo. Furthermore, as a novel element occupying public space in the barrio, I \nautomatically made myself a subject of investigation to the territorially-conscious pandilleros. \nJulio however also later told me that they had been mystified by my appearance. On the one \nhand, I was obviously a \u2018chele\u2019,10 or foreigner, and therefore normally classifiable as socially \n\u2018other\u2019, but on the other hand I also had a pandillero look, being shaven-headed and sporting \nan earring, and so they had wondered whether I wasn\u2019t a European \u2018broder\u2019 of some sort. \nHaving a totally shaved head was deemed particularly \u2018da\u00f1ino\u2019, or \u2018bad\u2019.11 Only Julio, who \nwas considered to be one of the most \u2018da\u00f1ino\u2019 of the barrio pandilleros, had a shaved head \nwhen I arrived in the barrio, although many pandilleros had haircuts which incorporated a \npartial shaving of their head, as the act of was very much associated with the image of the \npandillero. Earrings were more common to the youth population generally, but still retained \nsomething of a frisson of \u2018badness\u2019, as did tattoos (which I did not have). Furthermore, I was \nspending hours idling in the street, which was pandillero activity par excellence, and I was \nchain-smoking \u2013 for nervous reasons \u2013 like they had never seen anybody chain-smoke before, \nwhich caused a mixture of curiosity and a certain respect. \nThis probationary phase of socialization ended after a couple of weeks, when other \nyouths began to join our daily palavers, which sometimes became nightly ones lasting until \nthe early hours of the morning, during which marijuana was almost always smoked, glue \noccasionally sniffed, and alcohol frequently consumed. At this point, they also dropped all \npretence about not being pandilleros, actively talking about a variety of violence- and \ndelinquency-related topics in my presence, including planned and executed robberies, \nmuggings and assaults. A week into this new pattern of interaction, the process of my formal \ninitiation into the barrio pandilla began. This consisted of three distinct \u2018rites of passage\u2019 that \noccurred over the course of a month. The first two rites were highly formalised \u2013 although the \nsecond was clearly modified as a result of my being a chele \u2013 while the third was more \nspontaneous, and arguably must be conceptually distinguished from the previous two.12\n                                                          \n9 Although female pandilleras are not unknown in Nicaragua, they are not common, and there were none in the \nbarrio Luis Fanor Hern\u00e1ndez gang (see Rodgers, 2006: 285-87, for an interpretation of this gender bias). \n10 The term \u2018chele\u2019 is used in Nicaragua to denote Europeans \u2013 in opposition to the North American-indicating \n\u2018gringo\u2019 \u2013 although it can also mean fair-skinned more generally (see Lancaster, 1992: 217). \n11 The word also has a range of other connotations, including \u2018destructive\u2019, \u2018harmful\u2019, and \u2018malicious\u2019. \n12 Even if anthropologists inevitably impose a certain subjective sense onto their ethnographic experiences, this \n \n \n7 \n \n \nStanding one\u2019s ground \n \n The first episode of my initiation occurred one afternoon about a month after I had \ntaken up residence in the neighbourhood. I was sitting on the curb side in a barrio street, \nchatting away with a dozen pandilleros, when all of a sudden, conversation died down and I \nsuddenly found that everybody was looking at me intently. I was about to ask what was up \nwhen Norman pulled out a knife and began to act threateningly towards me. My requests that \nhe desist falling on deaf ears, it was obvious that this was leading to a violent confrontation, \nwhich I felt distinctly unprepared for. At this point, however, one of the numerous instances \nof serendipity that accompanied me all through my fieldwork materialised, in the fact that \nNorman\u2019s knife was a Swiss Army knife (and I hasten to add that it was not one of those \nsmall officer\u2019s knives which can be bought in almost any airport gift shop around the world, \nbut a larger model \u2013 although operating on the same flip opening and closing principle \u2013 \nwhich is issued to Swiss Army infantrymen for, amongst other things, hand-to-hand combat). \nI grew up in Switzerland, and have played around with such knives since my childhood, \nwhich meant that I am relatively familiar with them. Ignoring Norman\u2019s increasingly \nthreatening gestures as best I could, I more or less confidently asked him to \u2018give me that \nknife which comes from where I come from and I\u2019ll show you some tricks that you don\u2019t \nknow\u2019. \n Norman abruptly ceased his antics and after a moment\u2019s thought, and egged on by the \nother pandilleros, handed me the knife. Everybody crowded around me, excited at the \nprospect of this novelty, and laughed when I fell into a fighting crouch and mock-stabbed at \nNorman, saying \u2018Aha! I\u2019ve got the knife now, mate! What are you going to do about it?\u2019. \nAlthough I was unable to demonstrate any special skill in manipulating the knife, it became \napparent that the situation had been defused, and that I had passed what I could see ex post \nfacto had been a test. Mart\u00edn S\u00e1nchez Jankowski (1991) points out that in the US context such \ntests can often serve to evaluate a potential gang recruit\u2019s combat capabilities, since a poor \nfighter can be a liability to the gang in violent situations. Obviously my response did nothing \nof the sort, but the underlying logic of the test was arguably different, and was linked to \nnotions of machismo rather than my potential combat capabilities. As Roger Lancaster (1992: \n195) points out, \u2018taking risk, displaying bravado in the face of danger, is ...very much the \nessence of machismo\u2019s ideal of manhood\u2019, and this was precisely what I (unwittingly) enacted \nin my dealing with Norman\u2019s attack. I had more or less managed to hide my fear and \nnonchalantly ask for the knife which was being used to threaten me in order to show him how \nto use it better. Even if I was unable to produce the intimated skill, this only served to \nhighlight the bluster of my actions, as Julio intimated when he told me afterwards \u2018well done, \nmaje [mate], you couldn\u2019t do shit but you still got the knife!\u2019 \n \nStealing women\u2019s underwear \n \n The next phase of initiation occurred a week after the knife incident. Around eight in \nthe morning, it became obvious that Julio, Miguel, and Jairo were waiting in front of the \nG\u00f3mez home for me to come out. When I did, they suggested that we take a trip to the nearby \nmarket, which I readily acquiesced to, as this was the first time somebody from the barrio had \n                                                                                                                                                                                     \nreflexivity is nevertheless grounded in the \u2018shared social experience\u2019 of the field context (Hervik, 1994: 96). My \ninterpretation of these events as an \u2018initiation\u2019 divisible into distinct \u2018rites of passage\u2019 was very much shaped by \nthe pandilleros\u2019 explicit and repeated labelling of what follows as my \u2018iniciaci\u00f3n\u2019, and their making clear \ndistinctions between its different phases. \n \n \n8 \n \nsuggested going somewhere outside the neighbourhood with me. As we walked to the market, \nhowever, Julio informed me that we were going to steal something from a stall. Suddenly \nfeeling cold all over, I hastily suggested that it was probably not a good idea for me to \nparticipate in the robbery, considering that as a foreigner I would be easily identifiable. Julio \nreplied with a smile that this had been thought of \u2013 betraying the fact that the enterprise was \npremeditated \u2013 and explained the plan, which was to involve my going up to the targeted stall \nalone and distracting the seller so that the others could run by and grab whatever they could. \nSeeing no easy way out of the situation, and appeasing my conscience by telling myself that I \nwouldn\u2019t be doing the actual robbing, I agreed, and it was decided that we would meet up \nafterwards in the barrio. \n Julio later told me that normally I would have had to carry out the robbery, but that \nthis particular arrangement was a concession to my foreigner status. It nevertheless ensured \nthat I would be an integral part of the misdeed, something that was obviously the most crucial \nelement of this rite of passage. My active collaboration was further reinforced after the \nrobbery, when I rejoined Julio, Miguel, and Jairo in the barrio. The heist had gone as planned, \nand the three had stolen eight \u2018bloomers\u2019 [women\u2019s underwear], which they presented to me \nwith huge grins on their faces, telling me that I now had to sell them, so that they could judge \nhow good I was at \u2018bisnes\u2019, as they put it. With the three of them trailing behind me, I \napproached passing women in the barrio, and after about an hour and a half had succeeded in \nselling the eight items of clothing for a grand total of 43 c\u00f3rdobas (approximately US$5 at the \ntime). From what Julio and the others told me, this was by no means brilliant, but it was not \nthe worse performance they had ever seen by a first-time fence...13\n As we gathered to talk and smoke that evening in the \u2018Calle Ocho\u2019 [Eighth Street] \nalleyway \u2013 so-named after a notoriously dangerous street in downtown Managua \u2013 the \npandilleros told me that I was now a true \u2018broder\u2019, and a fully-fledged member of the \npandilla. I replied that I was very happy to be a pandillero, and that I looked forward to many \nnights chatting, drinking, and laughing together, but that I would not be able to participate in \ncertain activities which I understood were typical of being a pandillero, such as attacking and \nrobbing people and other neighbourhoods. I said that this was due to a variety of reasons, \nincluding my chele status, as well as my personal sense of ethics. I also said that I didn\u2019t want \nto use firearms, once again invoking ethical reasons but also the fact that I had no idea how to \nuse them, and I concluded my speech asking whether I might become an \u2018observer member\u2019 \nof the gang, \u2018like the UN\u2019 (sic). To my surprise, the pandilleros accepted this without protest. \nAs later became apparent, however, this demand created the need for a third rite of passage. \n \nDefending the barrio \n \n About two weeks after the market robbery, I was sitting one afternoon on the curb side \nin front of the G\u00f3mez home, chatting away with Argentina, Adilia, Wanda, and Elvis, when \nsuddenly a group of some thirty to forty youths came running down the street, throwing \nstones, shouting loudly, and setting upon passers-by. Elvis and I started throwing stones at \nthem, covering the retreat of the others into the house. As soon as they were inside and had \nbarricaded themselves, Elvis and I entrenched ourselves behind some trees in front of the \nhouse to defend it, while the invading pandilla \u2013 for that was what it was \u2013 broke up into \nsmall groups which each concentrated on throwing stones at houses and beating up anybody \nstill left in the street. Elvis and I were rapidly joined by three other barrio pandilleros, which \n                                                          \n13 The bloomers sold for about 20 c\u00f3rdobas in the market, but a large mark-down is always the norm with stolen \ngoods. There was a thriving market for such minor stolen items in the barrio, so there was little merit in my \nbeing able to sell them. Indeed, the oddity of being a foreigner selling stolen goods probably made this easier. \n \n \n9 \n \nenabled us to force the retreat of the small group of invading pandilleros that had chosen the \nG\u00f3mez house as their target. We then began to help other groups of barrio pandilleros, who \nwere similarly engaged in recapturing the barrio block by block, fighting rival pandilleros, \nthrowing stones and engaging in hand-to-hand combat, until the invaders turned and ran. \nAs I walked around the barrio to see if anybody was badly hurt, Julio came up to me \nand said, \u2018now you\u2019re really one of us, Dennis, we\u2019ve seen that you\u2019ve got the onda [spirit], \nvimos que quer\u00e9s al barrio [we\u2019ve seen that you love the barrio], and that you\u2019re not scared \nand are ready to defend it. \u00a1Ahora si, s\u00f3s un broder! [Now you\u2019re really a brother!]\u2019. Other \npandilleros also came up to me, and said similar things, and it is at this point that I felt that I \nreally became accepted as a member of the pandilla. Although the pandilleros could accept \nmy having an \u2018observer member\u2019 status, and could countenance my refusing to attack or rob \npeople, I needed to actively demonstrate that I had the pandillero \u2018onda\u2019, which included not \njust having a shaved head, drinking, or (sometimes) smoking marijuana, but most importantly \nshowing that I \u2018loved\u2019 the barrio by being willing to put myself at risk in its defence. This \ncriterion was clearly one that required regular reaffirmation, however, and I was to have many \noccasions to \u2013 often unwittingly \u2013 reaffirm my predispositions towards it, as the attack on the \nbarrio that I have just recounted was only the first and indeed one of the more innocuous of \nmany such encounters during my stay, future battles frequently involving not only sticks and \nstones, but also often home-made mortars, handguns, AK-47s, and fragmentation grenades. \n \nReputation, being \u201cda\u00f1ino\u201d, and \u201cel chele pandillero\u201d \n \nThere were also reasons other than my \u2018onda\u2019 for initiating me into the pandilla, \nlinked to questions of reputation. A pandilla\u2019s reputation is a source of identity for its \nmembers, and also determines inter-pandilla relations. It can depend on several factors, \nincluding first and foremost the gang\u2019s brutality. The barrio Luis Fanor Hern\u00e1ndez pandilla \nwas for example the most violent gang within an area made up of half a dozen \nneighbourhoods, two informal settlements, and a market, and this contributed greatly to its \nlocal symbolic dominance. A further contributing element was the pandilla\u2019s territory. \nAlthough the barrio Luis Fanor Hern\u00e1ndez pandilla\u2019s core territory was relatively small, the \ngang members roamed with impunity far and wide, and were dominant in public areas such as \nthe nearby market or around traffic lights and crossroads (which were ideal carjacking spots). \nFurthermore, the historical notoriety of the barrio, which had been known in the past as a \nneighbourhood of \u2018tamales\u2019 [thieves], and had reputedly been one of the poorest and most \ndangerous barrios in Managua, clearly rubbed off onto the pandilla. Indeed, the barrio \npandilleros in fact actively claimed an intimate association with the past, calling themselves \n\u2018Los Sobrevivientes\u2019 [Survivors], in reference to the neighbourhood\u2019s pre-revolutionary name, \n\u2018La Sobrevivencia\u2019, which they clearly associated with something of a \u2018golden age\u2019 in terms \nof violence, as a pandillero called Wilmer intimated to me during an interview: \n \n\u2018\u00a1Fu\u00e9 lo m\u00e1ximo, maje! [It was the best, man!] People respected us. Nobody \ncame into the barrio, nobody, you know? You came in on foot at one end of \nthe barrio and out in a coffin at the other. Even the Guardia were too scared to \ncome into the barrio. Fuck, man, they bombed us with planes they were so \nscared to come in. We were feared!\u2019 \n \n The personal characteristics of individual pandilleros were also an important \ncomponent of a gang\u2019s reputation. The most significant was the extent to which a pandillero \nwas considered \u2018da\u00f1ino\u2019, a status attribution linked to violence. For example, a gang \nmember\u2019s reputation was clearly enhanced if he had been involved in a murder, or displayed \n \n \n10 \n \nsystematically brutal or sadistic behaviour. At the same time, however, it wasn\u2019t necessary for \na gang member to have killed or to be tremendously violent in order to be labelled \u2018da\u00f1ino\u2019. \nRather, he had to be associated with a pattern of cheerfully exuberant violence and risk-\ntaking.14 Julio, for example, was considered extremely \u2018da\u00f1ino\u2019 by other gang members \nbecause he was always recklessly enthusiastic during gang warfare, for example seeking out \nparticular adversaries and purposefully exposing himself to their gunfire \u2013 when battles \ninvolved such weapons \u2013 in order to better \u2018defy\u2019 them, \u2018daring them to do their best to injure \n[him] seriously\u2019, as he put it (something which happened only once during the year of my stay \nin the barrio, when he was shot in the arm). Although I was frequently involved in gang \nwarfare, I cannot claim to have been \u2018da\u00f1ino\u2019 in the same way. My refusal to use firearms but \nwillingness to nevertheless go up against them in battle however provided me with a certain \nmeasure of \u2018da\u00f1idad\u2019. But this was clearly more \u2018passive\u2019 in nature than Julio\u2019s \u2018active\u2019 risk-\ntaking, and it was the latter that really contributed to a gang\u2019s reputation. Certainly, the \nmultiple occasions when I unwittingly exposed myself to gunfire tended to cause more mirth \nthan admiration among my fellow pandilleros. \nI did, however, have other non-violent attributes. In particular, my being a foreigner \ncontributed something unique to the pandilla\u2019s reputation, insofar as \u2013 to the best of my \nknowledge \u2013 there were no other gangs in Managua with a \u2018chele pandillero\u2019, as I came to be \nknown.15 The pandilleros were clearly aware of the reputation-enhancing potential of \nassociating me with the gang, often mentioning it in conversation. I have to admit that I \ninitially assumed this to be banter, and dismissed it as nothing more than an amusing \nanecdote. I quickly discovered the consequences of this new social role when a few days after \nthe last phase of my initiation, I woke up to find that the barrio water supply had, not \nunusually, been cut off. Having a formal appointment outside the barrio, I decided to go and \nhave a shower in the neighbouring barrio Pablo Quintero, where Do\u00f1a Yolanda\u2019s daughter \nCarola lived. Despite it being broad daylight, the G\u00f3mez family did not want to let me go, \ntelling me that it was too risky due to the war going on between that barrio pandilla and \n\u2018ours\u2019, the recent attack on the barrio having signalled the beginning of this conflict. My \n\u2018chele pandillero\u2019 status made me a primary target, insofar as pandilla warfare revolves \naround injuring, beating, or killing symbolically important members of the enemy pandilla. In \nthe end, Do\u00f1a Yolanda\u2019s lover, Don Saturnino, drove me to Carola\u2019s place in his taxi, waited \nfor me to have a shower, and then drove me back, while I lay low in the back seat, thinking to \nmyself that I still had a lot to learn about pandilla dynamics. \n \nViolence, ethics, and ethnographic practice \n \nMy newly acquired role as a pandillero meant that I rapidly familiarised myself with \nthe various gang codes and behaviour patterns over the course of the next few months. As \nsuch, joining the gang provided me with an incredible research opportunity. It allowed me \nextensive access to gang members, and led to open and frank interviews that were not clouded \nby fear (on either side). I was able to hear from gang members what it was that had motivated \nthem to become pandilleros, how they perceived themselves, as well as obtain extensive \ndetails about their illegal acts. Becoming a gang member also meant that I spent significant \namounts of time with pandilleros, both individually and collectively, during different \n                                                          \n14 Parallels can be made with Walter Benjamin\u2019s (1986: 301) \u2018destructive character\u2019, who is \u2018young and \ncheerful\u2019. \n15 This facet of the gang\u2019s reputation became notorious beyond the confines of the barrio and immediately \nsurrounding neighbourhoods, as I discovered in early June 1997 when interviewing a local district Police \ncaptain, who asked me whether I knew anything about a mysterious \u2018chele pandillero\u2019 whom he\u2019d heard was \noperating in the district. I of course answered no... \n \n \n11 \n \nactivities and at different points in time. This allowed me to compare the distance that \ninevitably exists between their discourses and their everyday actions, in a way that would not \nhave been possible as a non-member. At the same time, the ramifications of my joining the \ngang went further than simply providing me with easy access to the object of my study. In his \nseminal study of boxing, Lo\u00efc Wacquant (2004: vii-viii) suggests that \u2018there is nothing better \nthan initiatory immersion and even moral and sensual conversion to the cosmos under \ninvestigation\u2019, because this \u2018makes it possible for the sociologist to appropriate in and through \npractice the cognitive, aesthetic, ethical, and conative schemata that those who inhabit that \ncosmos engage in their everyday deeds\u2019. My initiation into the barrio Luis Fanor Hern\u00e1ndez \npandilla was analogous to this \u2018carnal sociology\u2019, insofar as becoming a member of the gang \nand adopting certain behaviour patterns allowed me to understand much more viscerally \nparticular aspects of gang life. I might well never have understood the nature of the \u2018love\u2019 that \nthe pandilleros felt for their neighbourhood, for example, because it was something that lay \noutside my intellectual horizons. \nAt the same time, however, my becoming a pandillero was not prompted by research \nconsiderations, but more because I felt it to be a valid personal survival strategy in what I was \nexperiencing as highly difficult and dangerous circumstances. I assumed that by becoming a \nmember of the pandilla, I would be unlikely to suffer violence from its members, and that I \nwould be able to draw on the gang for protection and support in the endemically unsafe \nconditions of urban Nicaragua. This certainly proved to be the case, as on many of the \noccasions when I was attacked after joining the pandilla, and could not adequately defend \nmyself, my fellow gang members came swiftly to my assistance. I quickly learnt, however, \nthat the gang at the time protected all those living in their local barrio, so becoming a member \nwas not a prerequisite for ensuring such support. Being a member of the gang nevertheless \nprovided me with a personal status which frequently helped defuse a number of potentially \ndangerous situations, and deterred a number of attacks by members of rival pandillas, for fear \nof provoking a war with the barrio Luis Fanor Hern\u00e1ndez gang. This would not necessarily \nhave been the case had I just been an inhabitant of the neighbourhood, and after several such \nevents within a few weeks of joining the gang, it became an important justification for my \nremaining a pandillero even after discovering that I did not need to be one in order for the \npandilla to protect me.16 I furthermore also learnt a lot from the pandilleros in very practical \nterms, as they taught me certain hand-to-hand combat techniques that helped me to extricate \nmyself from several nasty situations during my fieldwork, and also assisted in my developing \ncertain instincts that regularly allowed me to avoid danger spots. Without these, it is unlikely \nthat I would have left Nicaragua physically unscathed as I did. \nAt the same time, my becoming a pandillero also meant that I inevitably had to \nengage in a range of different forms of brutality \u2013 as well as accept even more without \nshowing any qualms \u2013 including sometimes being pro-actively physically violent against \nindividuals. This generally occurred in situations of gang warfare, when my resort to violence \nwas effectively a form of self-defence \u2013 insofar as I did not attack other neighbourhoods but \nonly defended my own \u2013 but occasionally involved one-on-one fighting with individual gang \nmembers, for reasons most likely linked to a periodic need to reconfirm my allegiance to the \ngang in the face of my not engaging in certain activities. Here, however, it was my initial \nunwitting transgression of the cognitive frameworks regulating this form of physical violence \nthat allowed me to experientially uncover a particular aspect of the pandillero life, as well as \nlearn how to deal practically with such situations. The sense of sheer terror that washed over \n                                                          \n16 It should be noted that contrarily to what is reported in much of the literature on gangs in other countries, \nleaving the gang is not problematic in Nicaragua, with membership being very much seen as something \nvoluntary, so this was not a factor in my deciding to stay in the gang. \n \n \n12 \n \nme the first time a gang member challenged me to one-on-one combat, seemingly for no \nreason at all, is still a very vivid memory. Contrarily to when Norman had confronted me \nduring my initiation, my reaction was to lash out in something of a blind panic, and I \nfortuitously incapacitated my putative opponent.17 While this effectively resolved the \nsituation, it was also made clear to me by the pandilleros that this constituted a contravention \nof the usual \u2018cultural performance\u2019 that such confrontations constitute, whereby opponents \nfollow a \u2018shared script\u2019 that entails a semi-ritualised pugilistic exchange that aims to show \nhow they can \u2018take\u2019 each other\u2019s blows (see Linger, 1992, for a Brazilian parallel). Not being \nparticularly strong or experienced at the so-called \u2018noble art\u2019, I decided there and then not to \neven try to conform to such expectations, but learn from my successful counter-current \nbehaviour, thereby subsequently earning myself a somewhat edgy reputation for \u2018fighting \ndirty\u2019. \nI was lucky to be able to resort to this kind of idiosyncratic behaviour without earning \nmore than an ambiguous reputation, however. My particular status as a foreigner meant that I \ncould lay down certain rules which were not options for other pandilleros. This was not \nalways the case, however, and by becoming a gang member I was often forced and expected \nto adopt a number of particular behaviour patterns, some of which were in fact compounded \nby my being a \u2018chele pandillero\u2019, as became apparent when I tried to take a shower in barrio \nPablo Quintero. This included having to participate in a range of violent and illegal activities, \nincluding gang wars, thefts, fights, beatings, fencing, and conflicts with the Police, as a result \nof which I underwent a number of things that I could have done without, including being \nattacked, threatened, beaten up, knifed, shot at, and thrown out of a moving car. My having \nengaged in such acts raises some obvious personal security issues. At the same time, though, \neven if some of these concerns can clearly be linked to my having become a gang member, it \nwas not the only factor that put me at personal risk, as my initial experiences of violence in \nNicaragua highlight well. Indeed, joining the gang clearly had positive security functions, as I \ndescribe above, and in a general manner it can be argued that it is often safer in dangerous \ncircumstances to be allied with the perpetrators of violence rather than their victims. \nObviously, this viewpoint raises a number of ethical questions. In this respect, Nancy \nScheper-Hughes (1992: 22-3) argues that there are two ways in which the morality of \nviolence can be approached. The first tends to \u2018understand morality as always contingent on, \nand embedded within, specific cultural assumptions\u2019. The second considers that \u2018the ethical is \nalways prior to culture because the ethical presupposes all sense and meaning and therefore \nmakes culture possible\u2019. These distinct viewpoints will generate very different ideas \nconcerning the morality and immorality of violence. It is not my intention to be drawn into a \ntortured discussion concerning which of these positions is epistemologically most \nappropriate; what I want to focus on instead is a more practical form of ethics. Even if many \nof my actions in Nicaragua can perhaps be seen as \u2018immoral\u2019 or \u2018unethical\u2019 in principle, I feel \n                                                          \n17 According to Hume (this issue), the role played by terror and fear in fieldwork \u2018is rarely singled out for \nconsideration in methodological discussions\u2019. In this respect, it is important to underline that terror often \nprecipitates \u2018a doubleness of social being in which one moves in bursts between somehow accepting the \nsituation as normal, only to be thrown into a panic or shocked into disorientation by an event, a rumor, a sight, \nsomething said, or not said\u2019 (Taussig, 1992: 18). Its routinised assimilation is thus highly contradictory and can \ninvolve a spread of reactions that will emerge variably at different points in time during fieldwork. Partly for this \nreason, I have always found it difficult to find the right words to describe my general state of being after joining \nthe gang. The most satisfactory characterization is probably as having undergone an \u2018out of body\u2019 experience, \ninsofar as I do not think I was completely \u2018there\u2019 for a lot of the time, or at least not completely conscious of the \npotential consequences of my acts. Certainly, in stark contrast to my first few months in Nicaragua, I do not \nrecall any feelings of fear or terror within a short while of joining the gang, although I do vividly remember \n\u2018coming to my senses\u2019 about a month before leaving Nicaragua, and spending this last month in a state of \nheightened fear. \n \n \n13 \n \nthat they are very much attenuated by the fact that joining the gang was primarily a survival \nstrategy on my part. Although it turned out that I did not have to join the pandilla in order for \nit to protect me once I had moved into the barrio, I had no idea of this initially, and by joining \nthe gang I was improvising as best I could in unfamiliar and unsettling circumstances. \nFurthermore, maintaining a disapproval of violence can be difficult in practice. It calls for \nlevels of judgement that can crumble as one becomes more and more associated with violent \nindividuals, to say nothing of violence itself. The simple fact of engagement often reveals the \nperpetrators of violence to be perfectly normal, often pleasant individuals, who almost \ninevitably become friends and confidents, to the extent that it is impossible to \nstraightforwardly condemn them (see Fielding, 1982).  \nSeen in this way, what arguably ultimately matters is not simply violence as a moral or \nimmoral act, but the reasoning behind its deployment, and with regards to ethnographic \nresearch the determining criterion is perhaps that \u2018the field worker ...has to continue living \nwith himself. If the participant observer finds himself engaging in behavior that he ...think[s] \nof as immoral, then he is likely to begin to wonder what sort of a person he is after all\u2019 \n(Whyte, 1955 [1943]: 327). This is something that I believe is very much situational. While in \nprinciple I find some of my actions in Nicaragua to be somewhat dubious according to my \ncurrent personal index of values, when I consider them in the context of the actual \ncircumstances I found myself when acting them out, I can quite happily live with myself. I did \nnot kill anybody, even if I did engage in violence. Some of this brutality could be seen as \ngratuitous or unjustified, but most of it was directly aimed at protecting myself or the \ninhabitants of the barrio that I was living in, both of which I felt were valid reasons for being \nviolent. At the same time, for ethical reasons I put certain limits on my violence, restricting \nmy active participation in gang brutality only to those acts that occurred in the \nneighbourhood, and refusing to use firearms, something that was actually detrimental to my \ncardinal preoccupation of ensuring my own survival, as it meant that all too often I found \nmyself in situations of trying to defend myself against gunfire with sticks and stones \n(thankfully \u2013 from my perspective \u2013 my fellow pandilleros had no such scruples). All of these \nbehaviours constitute an eminently individual code of conduct, however, which others may or \nmay not share. In the final analysis, a relative moral standard is set, which is perhaps difficult \nfor others who have not been in similar circumstances to understand or associate with. \n \nConclusion \n \nThe basic issue that I have tackled in this article through a consideration of my \nexperiences researching Nicaraguan youth gang violence is the fact that \u2018at some level, to be \nable to discuss violence, [the participant observer] must go to where violence occurs, research \nit as it takes place\u2019 (Robben and Nordstrom, 1995: 4). This is obviously dangerous, and has \nclearly deterred many researchers. At the same time, however, large numbers of \nanthropologists have experienced violence while carrying out ethnographic research around \nthe world. Despite this, there has been a serious lack of debate concerning \u2018the \nmethodological and subjective issue of the dangers anthropologists [can] face while in the \nfield\u2019 (Sluka, 1990: 114). The problem is partly conventional, insofar as the subject of \nviolence is such that the narrative deriving from any ethnographic investigation will almost \ninevitably lend itself to a high degree of sensationalism, particularly when the researcher \nwants to clearly situate him- or herself in the writing. There are high risks of falling prey to \nwriting what Philippe Bourgois (1995: 18) calls a \u2018pornography of violence\u2019,18 and this is \n                                                          \n18 Although I agree with the intentions that lie behind the use of this strongly moralistic expression, it should be \nnoted that the metaphor of \u2018pornography\u2019 hints at a rather detached conceptualization of the relationship \n \n \n14 \n \nwhy I have operated a subjective form of self-censorship in this article by focusing mainly on \nmy initiation into the barrio Luis Fanor Hern\u00e1ndez gang, which was a comparatively \ninnocuous component of my experiences researching Nicaraguan youth gang violence. \nWhether I have succeeded or not in achieving an appropriate balance I leave to the reader to \njudge; ultimately, as Bourgois (1995: 18) remarks, \u2018the problem and the responsibility are \nalso in the eyes of the beholder\u2019. \nMore generally, however, what I hope that this article will have demonstrated is the \nexistence of a critical epistemological bias within ethnographic studies of violence, insofar as \nmost ethnographers generally tend to have to a rather \u2018passive\u2019 relationship to violence, rarely \ninvolving themselves in the praxis of violence, despite the participatory nature of their \nprofessional enterprise.19 In other words, while the participant observer might be imagined as \na victim of violence, he or she is rarely considered as a potential perpetrator of violence. This \nis linked to a particular moral bias, whereby many social scientists investigating violence \noften do so with an agenda, looking to find positions from which \u2018to speak and write against \nviolence\u2019 (Nordstrom and Martin, 1992: 3). Such an endeavour is generally easier to achieve \nwhen writing from the perspective of victims rather than victimizers, for obvious reasons. Yet \nstudying the violent is arguably just as crucial as studying their victims if we are to fully \nunderstand the complexities of violence. As Cynthia Keppley Mahmood (1996: 272) remarks \nin her study of Khalistani Sikh militants, \u2018until it becomes fully normal for scholars to study \nviolence by talking with and being with people who engage in it, the dark myth of [the] evil \nand irrational [violent] will continue to overwhelm more pragmatic attempts to lucidly \ngrapple with the problem of conflict\u2019. Seen in this way, then, it can be argued that until \nethnographers find ways to effectively \u2018[make] danger a calling\u2019 (see Nietzsche, 1969 [1883-\n1885]: 48), we are unlikely to reach any coherent understanding of the violent dynamics of \ncontemporary Central America. \n \nBibliography \n \nAmit, V.
