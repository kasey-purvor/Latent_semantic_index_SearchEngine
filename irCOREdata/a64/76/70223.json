We envisage a world in which\nphysical work artefacts such as tools, are augmented with\nintelligent mobile nodes that are able to observe the work-\ning activities taking place, evaluate compliance with health\nand safety regulations and assist or actively enforce com-\npliance with these regulations. This vision creates a new\nfield of work in the area of health and safety aware intel-\nligent mobile sensor networks. In this paper we describe\na number of new challenges faced when developing mobile\nsystems for compliance with health and safety regulations.\n1. Introduction\nWorkplace health and safety is an important societal goal\nthat concerns businesses and governments alike. In particu-\nlar, industrial areas such as construction sites, factories and\nchemical plants, pose enormous risk for workers and op-\neratives. To ensure health and safety, work practices are\ngoverned by extensive rules and regulations, and compli-\nance with these regulations is a major issue for employers.\nAs complexity of legal requirements mounts, companies are\nforced to devise innovative ways to ensure health and safety\nof their employees and compliance with ever changing reg-\nulations.\nSensor-based mobile technologies provide opportunities\nfor creating novel health and safety solutions for industrial\nworkplaces. Together with several industrial companies we\nare exploring concepts and technologies for assisting work-\ners in the field through automatic real-time assessment of\nwork activities. Our approach is based on the idea of turning\nwork-related artefacts such as tools and equipment, into co-\noperating mobile computing entities able to recognise, track\nand assess work activities, and to provide real-time informa-\ntion about health and safety compliance to workers.\nWe achieve this by embedding wireless sensor\/actuator\ndevices that communicate over ad-hoc wireless networks,\ninto tools. Figure 1 illustrates this concept. Tools equipped\nwith sensors detect ongoing work activities and create activ-\nity records. These records are automatically mapped against\nregulations to assess health and safety compliance. Com-\npliance data is then used to assist workers in the field, for\nexample by providing real-time information about rule vi-\nolations. Health and safety rules are encoded and stored\nin mobile nodes, thus enabling full operation wherever and\nwhenever workers operate equipment.\nOur approach contrasts sharply with the current practice\nof health and safety assessment. Although mobile solutions\nfor manually capturing compliance data in the field exist,\nour field studies at several industrial sites indicate systemic\nproblems related to the completeness, accuracy and consis-\ntency of captured data. Our vision creates a new field of\nwork in the area of mobile computing with the introduction\nof support for health and safety.\nWe believe that given the humanitarian and commercial\nbenefits, this field is likely to emerge as a hot topic of re-\nsearch for the mobile computing community. In the remain-\nder of this paper we focus on the research challenges for the\nmobile computing community that arise from such a vision.\n2. Understanding Health and Safety Regula-\ntions\nHealth and safety regulations are defined by legal author-\nities such as governments or international bodies (e.g. Euro-\n  \nActivity \nData \nH&S \nRules and \nRegulations \nCompliance \nAssessment In-situ \nAssistance \nNetwork node \nSensor component \nActuator component \nActivity Detection \nFigure 1. Health and Safety System\npean Union). Typically, these regulations consist of textual\ndescriptions of policies that should be applied to promote\nsafety in the workplace. Such policies may take the form\nof tasks that need to be performed or dictate limitations in\ncertain aspects of a job. However, one particular character-\nistic of these regulations is that they do not normally define\nthe specific techniques that need to be employed in order\nto achieve the goals required. This ambiguity can lead to\nthe acquisition of work practices that may be impractical,\nunreliable, or that may introduce unreasonable levels of in-\nefficiency.\nCurrently, most health and safety rules rely on human\ninformation gathering and recording in the field with de-\ncisions being taken by workers, supervisors or back office\nstaff processing the data \u2018off-line\u2019. For example, there are\ncertain H&S regulations designed to limit workers\u2019 expo-\nsure to hand-arm vibrations when operating heavy vibrating\nmachinery. Permitted exposure levels depend on the inten-\nsity and frequency as well as exposure time to vibrations.\nThe current practice is for the operatives to manually record\ntool usage on paper sheets and to estimate vibration expo-\nsure by assuming the densest possible surface which results\nin the highest vibration magnitudes. With the current prac-\ntice, the problem is, of course, that the ultimate responsibil-\nity is left to operatives who might not pay attention to these\nguidelines or may underestimate the exposure to vibrations.\nTo understand the domain of H&S support systems we\nhave been working closely with domain experts from ma-\njor international companies. In collaboration with a large\npetrochemical company, we have studied the handling and\nstorage of chemicals at a large chemicals plant in UK.\nCorrect handling and storage of chemicals is critical to\nensure protection of the environment and safety in the work-\nplace. For example, hazardous chemicals must be stored in\na way that physically separates reactive agents, or storage\nof certain materials should not exceed a predefined critical\nmass or volume. However, the manual processes employed\nare not foolproof, which can lead to accidents sometimes of\ndisastrous proportion.\nWe developed a prototype system for monitoring H&S\ncompliance consisting of safety-aware chemical containers\naugmented with intelligent sensor nodes and programmed\nwith domain-specific H&S rules [10]. A container recog-\nnises workers\u2019 handling operations, assesses its own stor-\nage situations and notifies personnel about potential haz-\nards. We developed similar prototypes for H&S compli-\nance checking related to vibration and noise exposure dur-\ning equipment use.\nThrough technology probes such as these we were able\nto identify a number of research challenges faced when\ndeveloping mobile support systems for compliance with\nhealth and safety regulations.\n3. Research Challenges\nOur vision is of a world in which physical work arte-\nfacts are augmented with cooperating mobile nodes featur-\ning both sensors and actuators, and communicating over ad-\nhoc wireless networks. For the purposes of this paper we\nassume a system architecture as pictured in Figure 1.\nCollections of mobile sensors, actuators, display units\nand personal devices form dynamic ad-hoc networks. The\ndata collected by the sensor nodes is used for detecting the\nactivities performed in the field. This activity data is as-\nsessed with respect to H&S regulations and any required\nactions are fed back into the system.\nThe envisioned H&S infrastructure fulfils a mission criti-\ncal task and thus must address many of the standard require-\nments associated with work in such a domain, i.e. it must\nbe reliable, predictable, trusted, fault-tolerant, and manage-\nable. A further challenge for the system we envisage is that\nit must operate in an environment characterised by change.\nFor example, regulations, sensing infrastructure and the ap-\nplications operating on the system are all likely to be subject\nto constant change. The dynamic nature of both regulations\nand physical infrastructure requires a dynamic and adaptive\nprocess for compliance checking.\nTo address this challenge we are exploring the use of a\nmodel-based approach with three elements:\n1. a declarative model of H&S regulations\n2. a dynamic model of the infrastructure describing its\ncapabilities and the location of its components\n3. a top-down approach for compliance checking that dy-\nnamically maps compliance tasks to infrastructure as-\nsemblies.\nRather than performing sensing and interpretation\nbottom-up, i.e. driven by available sensor data, we envi-\nsion a top-down approach that extracts sensing tasks from\nthe regulation model, identifies which parts of the sens-\ning\/actuators infrastructure are able to perform which tasks\nand assigns tasks accordingly. Tasks could be reassigned\ndynamically as regulations and infrastructure change.\nA declarative model of H&S regulations could dramat-\nically reduce the \u2018time to market\u2019 of H&S policies, while\na dynamic infrastructure model would allow dynamic opti-\nmisations at many layers of the system. Indeed, by deter-\nmining how to evaluate H&S rules there is the possibility to\ncarry out the processing either locally or remotely (from the\nperspective of the mobile node). Global loops span from\nsensors and actuators to backend systems and are appro-\npriate for non-time critical system behaviours. Local loop\nprocessing, on the other hand, involves clusters of strongly\nconnected devices in the field able to make decisions about\nlocal phenomena. For example, the decision as to whether\na storage regulation has been violated in the case study\ndescribed in Section 2, should be made locally by safety-\naware containers.\nDeveloping H&S systems such as the ones described,\npresents numerous challenges at many different levels of\nthe system. For this paper, we do not describe the tradi-\ntional challenges associated with developing safety-critical\nsystems but instead focus on novel challenges that arise\nfrom trying to support H&S compliance. Many of these\nchallenges reflect the combination of technical and human\naspects that we believe will be characteristic of systems in\nthis field and is a factor that differentiates work in this do-\nmain from many conventional sensor networks.\n3.1. Specifying and Recognising Compliance\nThe fundamental task of our proposed system is to un-\nderstand what is going on in the workplace and to match\nregulations against this understanding. This requires that\ncomponents of the system are able to build a dynamic world\nmodel that includes people, tools and activities, and that\nregulations can be expressed in terms of (or at least mapped\nto) objects in this world model.\nConstructing and maintaining a model of this type is a\ncomplex task that has been the subject of much research.\nThere is a significant amount of work on activity recogni-\ntion within ubiquitous computing that enables systems to\nunderstand the activities being performed by their users.\nHowever, the nature of our domain raises new challenges.\nRecognising activities undertaken by field workers is dis-\ntinct from conventional ubicomp activity recognition that\nhas traditionally assumed well constrained environments\nsuch as smart rooms [11], or wearable activity recognition\nthat has focused on body-worn sensors only [2]. In addition,\nthese approaches assume plentiful training data that enables\nmachine learning techniques to be employed [6].\nIn our target environments such assumptions do not hold:\nthe environment is dynamic with people, tools and activities\nchanging and sensor nodes arriving and leaving. As a result,\nactivity recognition is significantly more challenging \u2014 for\nexample, representative training data is unlikely to be avail-\nable in a timely fashion.\nIn addition to creating a world model, it is also neces-\nsary to provide a means of specifying H&S rules in terms\nof this model. H&S rules currently do not provide any of\nthe formalisms required for automation. For example, to\nenable H&S rules to be specified for our system we re-\nquire constructs for expressing not just the logic of the rules\nthemselves but also uncertainty and spatial and temporal\naspects (e.g. proximity, containment and adjacency). De-\nveloping an appropriate model and language for expressing\nH&S rules is therefore a significant challenge.\n3.2. Engineering Optimisations for Health and\nSafety\nThe purpose of the envisioned H&S system is not just\nto collect compliance-related information for off-line anal-\nysis. The greatest advantage comes from the ability to warn\nworkers and supervisors in the field about violations of reg-\nulations and impending dangers so that they can adjust their\nwork activities accordingly. In effect, an intelligent H&S\nsystem can be viewed as a hybrid of an interactive system\nand a distributed control system.\nA significant challenge for this domain resides in the de-\nsign and development of self optimising network configu-\nrations capable of balancing the real-time and energy effi-\nciency requirements of the system. In essence, such net-\nworks must be equally capable of supporting a device for\nmonths at a time, yet react without delay when a dangerous\nscenario arises.\nExisting self optimisation techniques for ad-hoc net-\nworks typically use network topology information along\nwith the power status of nodes to derive packet and sleep\nschedules to maximise the \u2018lifetime\u2019 of the network [14].\nSuch approaches would not provide optimal solutions in\nH&S systems, as they do not take into account two key\ncross-cutting aspects of the system - human factors and for-\nmalised application requirements.\nHuman Factors. Unlike more traditional wireless sensor\nnetworks, humans are an intrinsic part of our system. Hu-\nmans can respond to warnings or alerts from the devices and\ninteract with them to improve the system itself, e.g. they are\ncapable of repositioning devices in the environment to im-\nprove the accuracy of sensed data. The optimisation of such\nenvironments needs to take into account the capabilities of\nnot just network nodes, but the humans in the system.\nFormalised Application Requirements. Companies\ntend to translate H&S regulations into company work\npractices and rules that workers should follow to maintain\nH&S compliance. Given the formal nature of these policies,\nthe requirements for supporting a certain H&S regulation\ncan be precisely and dynamically derived at execution time\nby all layers of the system. The networking subsystem in\nparticular can use these requirements to form more accu-\nrate optimisation of routing, scheduling and aggregation\nschemes than can be achieved from topology information\nalone. The H&S rule sets are naturally distributed in nature,\nrequiring data sensed from different nodes to be compiled\ntogether to infer the current activity. Considerable gains\nin terms of overall network energy efficiency could be\nachieved by partial execution of rules on the most relevant\nnodes (e.g. where the sensed data is gathered) - essentially\nextending the ideas of distributed sensor data aggregation\nand query processing [3, 5] to include application specific\nprocessing.\n3.3. Providing Accountability and Data Provenance\nFor systems that are associated with H&S there is a need\nto be able to record data and system events for a variety of\npurposes such as accident investigation, litigation and long-\nterm studies of the impact of working practices. For H&S\nsystems we identify two distinct requirements. Firstly, we\nneed to be able to establish the provenance of data (such as\nsensor readings) within the system and, secondly, we need\nto be able to record and replay system events in order to\nduplicate the behaviour of the system at a given point in\ntime.\nData provenance typically refers to the process of tracing\nand recording the origins of data and its movement [1]. To\ndate, most of the work on data provenance has been carried\nout in the Grid and Database communities and assumes a\nfixed permanently available networking infrastructure and\nplentiful storage and processing resources. The challenge\nfor systems such as the one we are proposing is to establish\ndata provenance as data is created, e.g. on the nodes at-\ntached to physical artefacts and then to maintain this prove-\nnance throughout the data item\u2019s lifetime despite the limited\nresources and intermittent communications available.\nMaintaining data provenance as the data is moved and\nmodified is a specialised form of an audit trail [9]. Indeed,\nevery piece of data needs to be tagged by all services that\nalter its contents. More generally, we require the ability to\ncreate audit trails of system events to enable us to record and\nreproduce system behaviour. This is essentially a system\nlogging activity that is complicated by the target operating\nenvironment of low power ad-hoc wireless networks.\nIn addition to the constraints imposed by the operating\nenvironment, creating audit trails for H&S systems creates\na unique opportunity to correlate system events with the\nworkflows that are an inherent part of many H&S rules.\nThis coupling of audit trails and workflow has been ex-\nplored in [12]. Audit trails themselves may also be the sub-\nject of data provenance enquiries.\nWe note that both data provenance and audit trails inher-\nently rely on trusted system components. Trust in this con-\ntext is a complex issue that has several dimensions. Firstly,\nthere is the issue of the extent to which the sensor readings\nthemselves can be trusted - related of course to the issue of\nuncertainty. A second element of trust relates to the users\ninvolved in the system. In sharp contrast to most sensor net-\nwork research, we have users involved in the activities that\nwe are trying to monitor. Moreover, these users may be mo-\ntivated to try and distort the sensor readings for a variety of\nreasons (e.g. to circumvent a specific health and safety reg-\nulation). Detecting and preventing deliberate malicious be-\nhaviour by users (as opposed to accidental non-compliance)\nrepresents a significant challenge for the design of health\nand safety systems.\n3.4. Ensuring User Comprehension and User Ac-\nceptance\nWe see two fundamental human-factor challenges in the\ndesign of intelligent H&S systems:\n1. how to design intelligent H&S systems to maximise\nuser understanding\n2. how to design systems to maximise the chance that\nthey will be accepted by users.\nUnderstanding, i.e. comprehension of the system\u2019s ca-\npabilities and limitations, is crucial for an effective cooper-\nation between human and intelligent system. In the context\nof flight control systems, it has been shown that people may\nover-attribute capabilities to intelligent systems (i.e., mis-\ntakenly assuming that because a system can authoritatively\nautomate one aspect of functionality then it can also auto-\nmate other aspects of functionality) [8]. We do not know if\nthis effect will increase or decrease if we embed computa-\ntion and intelligence into previously un-augmented artefacts\nsuch as drums and drills.\nAcceptance of intelligent H&S systems by workers in\nthe field is determined by a number of factors. For exam-\nple, privacy is likely to play a central role because such sys-\ntems present possibilities for intensive surveillance. Privacy\nhas been the subject of much research techniques such as\nanonymising, hashing, cloaking, and blurring [7] that work\nin personal and social settings. However, it is unlikely that\nsuch techniques would be adopted by organisations inter-\nested in maximising visibility of work activities.\nTo address these challenges we see a great potential in\napproaches aimed at making systems scrutable. Scrutability\nis a term that is used in intelligent user interface research to\ndescribe a system that allows a user to inspect the model\nthe system maintains about him [4]. Scrutability has also\nbeen used in the context of Bayesian reasoning to help users\nunderstand how decisions of a complex interactive system\nare generated [13].\nScrutability has the potential to increase users\u2019 under-\nstanding, confidence and trust in a distributed sensing and\nreasoning system by making the system\u2019s assumptions and\nbehaviour transparent while at the same time limiting pri-\nvacy concerns. We see particular opportunities in exposing\nhigh-level provenance data to users and for generating ex-\nplanations of the system\u2019s behaviour that can be understood\nby users. For example, in the drum scenario from Section\n2, the system should not only raise an alarm if drums are\nstored incorrectly, it should also allow the worker, who is\nwell versed in safety procedures, to ask the system why a\nparticular regulation has been violated. The system\u2019s an-\nswer might refer to provenance data such as sensed quali-\nties (for example object distances), involved system compo-\nnents and safety regulations to generate a situation depen-\ndent explanation.\n4. Conclusions\nHealth and safety compliance is an issue of major im-\nportance in modern society. Improving the levels of com-\npliance has the potential to both save lives and bring sub-\nstantial economic benefits. In this paper we have introduced\nthe topic of mobile H&S systems and presented the results\nof our domain analysis work. This new field of work raises\nimportant challenges that cross-cut multiple system levels\nfrom hardware design to user interaction. By addressing\nthese challenges, the mobile computing community will be\nable to make a significant contribution to the well-being and\nproductivity of workers in hazardous environments.\nReferences\n[1] P.
