Ionosphere (Active experiments; Ionospheric ir-\nregularities) \u2013 Radio science (Ionospheric physics)\n1 Introduction\nArtificial ionospheric modification was first discovered in the\n1930s when large broadcasting stations started transmitting\nhigh power radio signals. The effect was first noted when\nthe modulation of Radio Luxembourg could be heard in the\nCorrespondence to: D. M. Wright\n(darren.wright@ion.le.ac.uk)\nbackground of other radio signals which passed through the\nregion of the ionosphere illuminated by its beam. The Lux-\nembourg effect, as it was first called, was later explained\nas cross-modulation between the two radio signals caused\nby the high-power transmission modifying the radio prop-\nagation characteristics of the ionosphere for the other ra-\ndio path (Tellegen, 1933; Bailey and Martyn, 1934). How-\never, the first purpose-built radio frequency (RF) ionospheric\n\u201cheaters\u201d were not constructed until the early 1970s. These\nwere then employed to perform experiments in the natural\nplasma laboratory provided by the ionospheric medium.\nThe first reported ionospheric modification (heating) ex-\nperiments, performed at Platteville, Colorado, revealed that\nthe transmission of a high power pump wave led to the gen-\neration of field-aligned electron density irregularities (FAIs;\nFialer, 1974; Minkoff et al., 1974). These occur as a result\nof coupling between the electromagnetic heater wave and up-\nper hybrid waves at the upper hybrid resonance height. Since\nX-mode polarised radio waves reflect below this height, the\nirregularities are only generated by O-mode radiation. These\nstructures can then act as intense targets for HF coherent scat-\nter radars (Robinson et al., 1997). Detailed discussions of\nthese heater-induced phenomena are given in the reviews by\nRobinson (1989) and Stubbe (1996). In the F-region, it is the\nanomalous self absorption of the O-mode heater wave at the\nupper hybrid altitude that gives rise to the enhancement in the\nelectron temperature that gives it name to heating. Through-\nout the region of electron temperature enhancement the elec-\ntron density mainly increases due to the temperature depen-\ndence of the recombination, although on a longer time-scale\nthan that exhibited by the electron temperature.\nA number of theories relating to the stimulation of artifi-\ncial FAIs by a high power pump beam have been put forward\nover the years. One invokes the thermal oscillating two-\nstream instability (TOTSI; e.g. Dysthe et al., 1983) for the\ncreation and rapid growth of the FAIs. More recently, Gure-\nvich et al. (1995) constructed a stationary theory of striation\nformation based on resonance instability. The TOTSI most\nreadily explains the radar observations which are presented\nPublished by Copernicus GmbH on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n544 D. M.

A theoretical curve showing the relationship between\nanomalous absorption and heater power (solid curve). The dashed\nlines show the different paths that lead to the hysteresis effect.\nin this study. In addition, a drawback of the theory of Gure-\nvich et al. (1995) is that it predicts abnormally high increases\nin electron temperature caused by the heater despite a rel-\natively small electron density perturbation (Borisov et al.,\n2005). These large enhancements in electron temperature\nhave not so far been detected.\nInitially, the TOTSI causes a linear conversion of elec-\ntromagnetic pump wave energy into upper hybrid waves\n(Vaskov and Gurevich, 1977; Dysthe et al., 1983; Robin-\nson, 1988). This coupling requires the presence of plasma\ndensity gradients (pre-existing FAIs) and leads to an increase\nin the FAI amplitude. Once this amplitude exceeds a thresh-\nold value (typically after a few milliseconds) the interaction\nbecomes nonlinear and the irregularity amplitude increases\nexplosively. One hypothesis suggests that it is the anoma-\nlous absorption of the pump itself (i.e. the conversion of the\nelectromagnetic pump wave into high frequency electrostatic\nwaves at the upper hybrid height) as a result of the interaction\nwith the heater-induced irregularities, that ultimately limits\nthe growth of the FAIs (e.g. Robinson, 2002). Under these\ncircumstances, the relationship between the pump power, P ,\nand the level of anomalous absorption, 0s is given by\nP\n[\ne\u22120\/2 1\u2212 (cosh(0\/2)\u22121) (ln a)\/pi\nP1\n+ 0e\n(00\u22120)\/4\n00P2\n]\n= 1 (1)\nwhere P1 and P2, respectively, are the required power thresh-\nolds for the initial and explosive stages of FAI growth, 00 is\nthe level of anomalous absorption before the heater was ac-\ntivated and a is a factor relating to the field parallel scale\nlength of the FAIs (see Robinson, 1989). The two terms in\nEq. (1) represent the initial and explosive instabilities. Since\nanomalous absorption 0\u221dn2, where n is the FAI amplitude,\nthen irregularity saturation as governed by Eq. (1) is shown\nas the solid curve in Fig. 1 in which 0 is plotted as a function\nof P.\nGrach et al. (1978) first postulated that a thermal para-\nmetric instability such as the TOTSI should be expected to\nexhibit hysteresis effects. The existence of hysteresis was\nconfirmed by the ionospheric modification experiments re-\nported by Erukimov et al. (1978) and subsequently by Stubbe\net al. (1982) and Jones et al. (1983). A hysteresis effect oc-\ncurs in the generation of FAI because the threshold power,\nPt , (shown in Fig. 1) required for the onset of FAI growth\nis higher than the critical pump power, Pc, at which the FAI\ncan no longer be sustained and, hence, collapse. The effec-\ntive threshold power is given by\nPt = P1P2\nP1 + P2 (2)\nwhere Pt is larger than both P1 and P2. So, once the heater\npower P>Pt then the FAI form explosively and saturation\nis rapid. This is demonstrated in Fig. 1 by the path ABCD.\nIf the pump power is then steadily reduced, the FAI do not\ncollapse until P<Pc, therefore following path DEFA.\nThis paper will mainly focus on observations of hystere-\nsis effects caused by ionospheric modification experiments\nusing the EISCAT Heater at Troms\u00f8 during a campaign in\n1997, and diagnosed by the CUTLASS high frequency (HF)\ncoherent radars and the EISCAT UHF incoherent scatter\nradar at Troms\u00f8. The hysteresis effects are known to be\nrelated to the generation of FAIs since they do not occur\nwhen X-mode polarised heater waves are transmitted which,\nas noted previously, are not associated with irregularity gen-\neration. The CUTLASS data presented here represent direct\nmeasurements of the FAI amplitude and are significant for\ndefining the irregularity power thresholds and saturation lev-\nels associated with backscatter received by the CUTLASS\nradar. They have provided a way of estimating the expected\nperformance of the new SPEAR (Space Plasma Exploration\nby Active Radar; Wright et al., 2000) high power heating\nfacility which has just been deployed at the high latitude lo-\ncation of Spitzbergen in the Svalbard archipelago.\n2 Instrumentation\n2.1 The EISCAT high power heating facility\nThe high power HF heating facility located near Troms\u00f8\ntransmits up to 1 MW of power which is radiated through\none of three 6\u00d76 phased arrays of rhombically broadened\ncrossed dipole antennas.

(1993).\n2.2 The CUTLASS radars\nThe global SuperDARN radar network (Greenwald et al.,\n1995) currently consists of 15 HF coherent radars, 9 of which\noperate in the Northern Hemisphere. Two of the North-\nern Hemisphere SuperDARN radars comprise the CUTLASS\n(Co-operative UK Twin Located Auroral Sounding System)\nsystem. CUTLASS is a frequency agile bistatic HF radar\nsystem (e.g. Milan et al., 1997) operating in the range 8\u2013\n20 MHz and consisting of stations at Pykkvib\u00e6r, Iceland and\nHankasalmi, Finland. Figure 2 shows the fields of view of\nthese radars, whilst operating in their standard mode, on a\nground projection along with the locations of the facilities\nat Troms\u00f8 and on Spitzbergen. The signals returned to the\nradars have undergone a Bragg-like backscattering process\nfrom FAIs in the ionosphere. There is an aspect angle de-\npendence for scattering, which requires that the radio wave\nk vector is close to orthogonal to the magnetic field. The\nexperiments described here utilise the EISCAT high power\nHF Heating facility at Troms\u00f8 which can generate artificial\nfield-aligned irregularities as described earlier and thus pro-\nvide a region of backscatter in the CUTLASS fields of view\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/24\/543\/2006\/ Ann.

Backscatter power (pwr l) measurements from the CUTLASS Hankasalmi (upper panel) and Pykkvib\u00e6r (middle) radars during the\npower stepping experiment utilising the Troms\u00f8 heater on 6 October 1997. The lower panel shows the output heater power as a function of\ntime during these observations.\n(e.g. Robinson et al., 1997) when backscatter may not al-\nready be present. This effect is illustrated schematically as\nthe inset in Fig. 2. The detection of artificial backscatter by\nHF radar then provides a powerful way of diagnosing plasma\nprocesses (e.g. Robinson et al., 1997) and observing geo-\nphysical phenomena (e.g. Yeoman et al., 1997).\nDuring the experiments relevant to this paper, the CUT-\nLASS radars employed a range resolution of 15 km, com-\npared to a normal gate length of 45 km. The radars were, as a\nresult, sounding over a reduced field of view compared with\nthat shown in Fig. 2, centred over Troms\u00f8 during these exper-\niments. The nearest range sounded on the Hankasalmi and\nPykkvib\u00e6r radars were, respectively, 480 km and 1470 km.\nTroms\u00f8 lies at approximately 900 km from the Hankasalmi\nradar and is twice as remote from Pykkvib\u00e6r. Typically, the\ntime resolution of the radar data presented varies from 1\u2013\n10 s. Only data from beam 5 of the Hankasalmi radar and\nbeam 15 of Pykkvib\u00e6r have been employed as these beams\noverlie Troms\u00f8, the location of the EISCAT heater. The high\nbackscatter powers that are characteristic of artificially gen-\nerated irregularities make it possible to integrate data over\nsuch short dwell times since the signal to noise levels are\nhigh.\n2.3 The EISCAT UHF radar\nThe European Incoherent Scatter (EISCAT) UHF radar (e.g.\nRishbeth and Williams, 1985; Rishbeth and van Eyken,\n1993) is often operated in support of artificial modification\nexperiments using the Troms\u00f8 heater (see Sect. 2.1). The\nSP-UK-HEAT experiments in October 1997, included UHF\nradar operation, with the transmit\/receive antenna at Ram-\nfjordmoen near Troms\u00f8, Norway, aligned approximately\nalong the local magnetic field direction (geographic azimuth:\n183.2\u25e6, elevation: 77.2\u25e6). Four pulse schemes were trans-\nmitted; long pulse, alternating code and two power profiles;\nonly data from the former is included here. The long pulse\nscheme provides observations of electron density, ion and\nelectron temperature and line-of-sight ion velocity over 21\nrange gates along the Troms\u00f8 beam, from approximately 140\nto 600 km altitude with a gate separation of \u223c22 km in alti-\ntude.\n3 Observations\n3.1 Radar observations of hysteresis\nOn 6 October 1997 an experiment was undertaken where the\nheater output power was, for a number of cycles, increased\nAnn. Geophys., 24, 543\u2013553, 2006 www.ann-geophys.net\/24\/543\/2006\/\nD. M. Wright et al.: Saturation and hysteresis effects in ionospheric modification experiments at Troms\u00f8 547\nfrom 0% to 100% output, using 2.5% steps and then decreas-\ning the power again to 0 % in the same fashion. Each step\nwas maintained for 9 s so that the entire cycle took exactly\n12 min to complete. The upper and middle panels of Fig. 3\nshow colour-coded range-time-intensity plots of backscatter\npower from the Hankasalmi and Pykkvib\u00e6r radars, respec-\ntively, with observations from both HF radars revealing the\nartificial irregularities generated by the heater over the course\nof the experiment. The data shown in Fig. 3 were mea-\nsured at a sounding frequency in the range 19.0\u201320.0 MHz\nand a time resolution of 1\u20132 s for the Hankasalmi radar (top\npanel), whilst Pykkvib\u00e6r (middle panel) transmitted in the\nrange 12.0\u201313.0 MHz with a time resolution of 10 s. The\nlower panel shows the heater output power over the same\ninterval. Five of the total of six full cycles were preceded\nby extended periods during which the heater was off to re-\nmove the possibility of any ionospheric preconditioning (see\nSect. 3.2) being caused by the heater. The Pykkvib\u00e6r radar\nwas not switched into its high time resolution mode until half\nway through the second cycle. The intense backscatter from\nHankasalmi was centred on range gate 28 (900 km distant)\nand that from Pykkvib\u00e6r was centred on range 37 (2025 km\nfrom the radar). The latter observations exhibit a range am-\nbiguity from the expected \u223c1800 km ground range. This\nis related to the fact that the range calculation algorithm is\nless accurate over the 1.5 hop ray path geometry required for\nPykkvib\u00e6r to observe scatter over Troms\u00f8. In contrast, Han-\nkasalmi acquires scatter over Troms\u00f8 over a 0.5 hop path.\nThese observations are commensurate with the findings of\nYeoman et al. (2001), who employed artificial backscatter to\nmake a range evaluation for the CUTLASS radars. The extra\ndistance travelled by the Pykkvib\u00e6r radar signal accounts for\nthe lower backscatter power received by this radar, which are\nroughly 10\u201320 dB down on those received by the Hankasalmi\nradar.\nFigure 4 presents the Hankasalmi HF radar data from the\nfirst cycle only, from 12.24 to 12.36 UT. Panel (a) shows\nthe time series data of backscatter power from range 28 of\nbeam 5, which is in the middle of the patch of artificial scat-\nter. Panel (b) illustrates the power stepping heater cycle at\nthe same time. By plotting the radar backscatter power as a\nfunction of heater output for the increasing and decreasing\nparts of the power cycle (Fig. 4c) a difference in the received\nradar power is immediately apparent. During the power-\nincreasing part of the heater cycle the backscatter power in-\ncreases rapidly until the heater output reaches 20% and there-\nafter continues to increase more steadily approaching a satu-\nration level of about 40 dB. On the way back down the two-\nstage backscatter power fall-off is less rapid than the equiv-\nalent steps on the way up to maximum heater output. The\nresult of this is that right down to the lowest power trans-\nmitted by the heater (2.5%, equivalent to an ERP of only\n3.9 MW) the difference in backscatter power caused by the\nhysteresis, 1Pd\u2212u, is \u223c20 dB. Figure 5 shows the equiva-\nlent plots to Fig. 4c for all six cycles in the experiment.

This will be discussed later.\nSimultaneous field-aligned EISCAT UHF measurements\nof the electron temperature (Te) and density (Ne) in the mod-\nified ionosphere are illustrated in Fig. 6 as a function of alti-\ntude for the UT period that covers all 6 heater cycles.

As for Fig. 4c but for all six cycles (a\u2013f) shown in Fig. 3.\nenhancements of the electron temperature correspond to the\nintervals when the heater was operating and, moreover, the\ntemperature can be seen to increase with the Heater power\nand lead to changes in the electron temperature 1Te\/Te of\n\u223c100% at maximum heater output. The interaction altitude,\nwhere the pump wave couples to upper hybrid waves, was\nderived from the location of \u201covershoot\u201d effects observed in\nthe ion line measurements made by the UHF radar and was\nfound to vary from 180\u2013200 km for this interval. There is,\nas has been demonstrated by Jones et al. (1986) and Robin-\nson (1989), a linear relationship between the electron tem-\nperature enhancement 1Te of the modified ionosphere and\nthe level of anomalous absorption, 0, and hence irregular-\nity amplitude. Figure 7 shows the variation of 1Te (nor-\nmalised with respect to the heater output power) as a func-\ntion of heater output for the first cycle in our interval. It\nshould be noted that the response time for changes in Te is\nof the same order as the time between steps in the Heater\npower cycles (Stocker et al., 1992) and as a result a slight\ntime offset in the overall response throughout the heater cy-\ncle is expected to exist. However, again a hysteresis effect is\nclearly seen where the electron temperature corresponding to\nthe final steps in the heater cycle is far higher than the value\nof the temperature during the initial heater steps. There is\nalso some evidence to suggest that hysteresis is exhibited by\nthe electron densities (not shown) where the maximum value\nof 1Ne\/Ne was \u223c10%. However, these relatively small\nchanges are masked by large changes in the ambient elec-\ntron density. The electron temperatures on the up-and down-\ngoing parts of the heater cycle only differ significantly for\nheater powers below 30\u201340% where CUTLASS backscatter\npower and irregularity amplitude are changing the fastest.\nAnn.

In order for unbiased\nheating effects to be observed it is often necessary to leave\nlong off periods (several minutes) between intervals of heater\non to give the ionosphere time to return to its unmodified\nstate. Changing the ionospheric conditions prior to another\ntype of experiment is known as preconditioning. A study\nof CUTLASS backscatter from heater-generated irregulari-\nties by Bond (1997) demonstrated that the decay time of FAI\n(and hence the duration of this preconditioning) was depen-\ndent on the time of day and was observed to vary from \u223c50\nin the early afternoon to \u223c200 s towards dusk.\nOn 7 October 1997, an experiment was performed to in-\nvestigate the effects of irregularity saturation, by heating the\nionosphere at low power levels, and preconditioning by us-\ning relatively short-lived high power pulses prior to longer\nbut low power heater cycles. The backscatter power received\nby the CUTLASS Hankasalmi radar during this experiment\nis reproduced in the middle panel of figure 8, in which a se-\nries of patches of artificial backscatter can be seen.

The results of the ionospheric seeding experiment of 7 October 1997: The middle panel shows the backscatter power received by the\nHankasalmi radar along beam 5 during heating with the Troms\u00f8 facility. Plotted in the upper panel is the backscatter power at range gate 30\nalong this beam. The lower panel depicts the heater output power throughout this interval.\npatch. Indicated in the lower panel is the heater power. From\n12:46 to 13:04 UT the underlying cycle was 1 min of heater\non followed by 2 min of heater off. These cycles were ar-\nranged in pairs with each transmitting the same final output\npower. However, for the first 20 s of the second cycle in each\npair the heater transmitted at full power. This shall hereafter\nbe termed the \u201cseed pulse\u201d. The final output power in each\nof the three pairs was, in turn, 2.5%, 5% and 10% of full\npower, as is evident in Fig. 8. The whole process was subse-\nquently repeated from 13:07 to 13:31 UT but now using an\nunderlying 2 min on, 2 min off heater cycle (see Fig. 8). It\nis evident from the upper panel of Fig. 8 that the backscatter\npower observed by the Hankasalmi radar was considerably\nhigher in those cycles with an initial seed pulse. Further-\nmore, in the absence of the seed pulse a larger backscatter\npower was received during a 2-min heater on than for a 1-\nmin heater on. This implies that at heater powers below 10%\nirregularity saturation required longer than 60 s in each case.\nThe increase in backscatter power, 1Pseed , obtained by the\nuse of the seed pulse, compared to that without, is indicated\nin Fig. 9. The upper panel of the figure corresponds to the\n1-min on\u20131-min off cycles and the lower panel, to the 2-min\non\u20132-min off cycles. For each pair of cycles corresponding\nto each final heater power (i.e. 2.5, 5 and 10%), the average\nbackscatter power from Hankasalmi is plotted as a cross for\nthe cycle containing a seed pulse and a plus sign for the cy-\ncle without. At low heater powers such as those employed in\nthis experiment (0\u201310%) the effects of using the seed pulse\n(ionospheric preconditioning) are dramatic and the duration\nthat the heater is active is also significant for the saturation\nof irregularities created by the heater. 1Pseed was as large as\n25 dB when using a seed pulse followed by the short duration\nheating interval at 2.5% output.\n4 Discussion and conclusion\nThis paper has presented the results of ionospheric modifi-\ncation experiments on two consecutive days in October 1997\nemploying the high power heating facility at Troms\u00f8. The\nCUTLASS HF coherent radars received backscatter from ir-\nregularities artificially generated by the heater. These irreg-\nularities provide a very coherent and intense target for the\nradars facilitating high spatial and temporal resolution diag-\nnosis of the plasma physical processes that lead to their exis-\ntence.\nThese experiments provide important insight into the\ngrowth and saturation of artificially stimulated FAI. A clear\nhysteresis effect is observed between the up- and down-going\nparts of the heater cycle, the difference in radar backscatter\nAnn.

The upper (lower) panel shows data\nfrom 1 (2)-min on, 1 (2)-min off heater cycles.\npowers being most marked at low heater powers, where\n1Pd\u2212u is typically 20 dB (or 100 times) more intense on the\ndown-leg. This is consistent with the theoretical curve shown\nin Fig. 1. As expected a similar effect is also observed in\nthe EISCAT measurements of electron temperature, which\nis modified by the heater interaction with the ionospheric\nplasma. Since the electron temperature is known to be pro-\nportional to the level of anomalous absorption (and hence re-\nlated to irregularity amplitude) then the curve in Fig. 1 should\nalso be applicable to the EISCAT observations. The growth\nof the irregularities indicated by the CUTLASS measure-\nments (see Fig. 4) occurs in two stages. For heater powers\nless than \u223c20% there is a very rapid increase in backscatter\npower and as the heater power is increased further the irreg-\nularity amplitude grows more steadily looking as though it is\napproaching a saturation value. However, in the observations\npresented here, the CUTLASS backscatter power never ap-\npears to quite saturate fully and presumably would continue\nto rise if the heater power could be increased further. It has\nbeen hypothesised that the extinction (self absorption) of the\nheater itself by interaction with its own FAI would limit the\namplitude of the FAI, and therefore the backscatter powers\nobserved by the radars.\n14:36 14:38\nUT\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\nP\no\nw\ne\nr \n(d\nB\n)\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\nH\ne\na\nte\nr \nO\nu\ntp\nu\nt \n(%\n)\n5%\nSUPERDARN PARAMETER PLOT\n\u00deykkvib\u00e6r: pwr_l (Beam 15, Range 37) 21 Oct 1999\nFigure 10\nFig. 10. Backscatter power received from the heated volume by the\nPykkvib\u00e6r radar (beam 5, range 37) during the up-going part of a\nsimilar heater cycle to that shown in Fig. 4. The dashed line shows\nthe heater output power during this interval, given by the scale on\nthe right hand side of the plot.\nThe hysteresis effects observed are the result of a form of\npreconditioning. This is borne out by the ionospheric seed-\ning experiments, the results of which are shown in Figs. 8\nand 9. Again, it is consistently observed that after a short\nhigh-power pulse much higher backscatter powers can be\nachieved for a given heater output level. This is particularly\npronounced for low heater powers where the backscatter ob-\nserved is as much as 20 dB more intense than for simply\ntransmitting heater radiation at low powers. This indicates\nthat, although a power threshold, Pt , has to be exceeded for\nFAI growth to occur (see Fig.1), once the irregularities exist\nthey can be maintained with much lower heater powers, as\nlong as this remains greater than Pc. This might be impor-\ntant where available heater power is limited.\nOne important motivation for these experiments was to\nevaluate the expected performance of the new heating facil-\nity, SPEAR, which is located almost 10\u25e6 further north than\nTroms\u00f8 in Svalbard (78\u25e6 N geographic). Currently, the max-\nimum power output of SPEAR is only 10% of that of the\nTroms\u00f8 heater. In addition, SPEAR is located \u223c2000 km\nfrom each of the CUTLASS radars (1800 km from Han-\nkasalmi and 2000 km from Pykkvib\u00e6r). This is similar to\nthe separation of the Pykkvib\u00e6r radar from Troms\u00f8 (about\ntwice the distance of the Hankasalmi-Troms\u00f8 path). Hence\nobservations of Troms\u00f8 artificial scatter from Pykkvib\u00e6r\ncan provide an initial estimate of the levels of backscatter\npower that might be provided using SPEAR. As is evident\nfrom Fig. 3, the Pykkvib\u00e6r radar certainly receives strong\nbackscatter from artificial FAI over Troms\u00f8, however this\nis some 10\u201320 dB weaker than that observed by the Han-\nkasalmi radar. This can be accounted for by the extra signal\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/24\/543\/2006\/ Ann. Geophys., 24, 543\u2013553, 2006\n552 D. M. Wright et al.: Saturation and hysteresis effects in ionospheric modification experiments at Troms\u00f8\nloss over the longer (1.5 hop) radio path. But, how sensi-\ntive is the Pykkvib\u00e6r radar to irregularities generated by the\nTroms\u00f8 heater at lower powers? This question can be ad-\ndressed by examination of Fig. 10, which shows the time se-\nries of backscatter power received by Pykkvib\u00e6r from the\ncentre of the heated ionospheric volume. In this case the\ndata were recorded from 14.35 to 14.39 UT on 21 October\n1999, another example of low power heating. This interval\nwas selected since the radar data had a time resolution of 1\ns which is higher than those shown in Fig. 3. The dashed\nsloping line overlaid on this figure indicates the power out-\nput of the heater, given by the scale on the right-hand side\nof the plot. Figure 10 demonstrates that the Pykkvib\u00e6r radar\ndetected artificial irregularities certainly for a heater output\nof 5% and also possibly at even lower powers. Since the\nTroms\u00f8 heater\u2019s experimental configuration on this date was\nsuch that maximum ERP was 199 MW, this implies that the\nCUTLASS radars should be sensitive to irregularities gener-\nated with heater ERPs of 10 MW or less. The current con-\nfiguration of the SPEAR high power facility enables an ERP\nof \u223c28 MW of RF radiation to be transmitted. A proposed\nfuture developmental phase would see this increased to about\n68 MW.\nAlthough the radar observations indicate that the irregu-\nlarity amplitude was still not fully saturated at the maximum\npower of the Troms\u00f8 heater \u2013 currently the most powerful fa-\ncility of this type \u2013 they also show that FAI can also be gener-\nated and sustained for much weaker heater powers (less than\n10 MW ERP). This is therefore very promising for future ex-\nperiments employing the SPEAR radar in its unique location\non Svalbard.\nAcknowledgements.
