It is suggested that this was \nbecause the adult rats remembered the identity of the juvenile, because when a novel \njuvenile was introduced for the second encounter, no such reduction in investigation \nwas observed. When the rats were either handled, placed in a smaller, novel, cage, or \nintroduced to a new juvenile midway through the IEI, investigation of the \nreintroduced juvenile did not decrease. This indicated that memory of that juvenile \nhad been disrupted. However, a simple change of cage during the IEI had no \ndisruptive effect on memory. These results suggest that routine husbandry procedures \ncan disrupt short-term social memory, which may lead to an increase in aggression \ndue to a failure of recognition. This has implications for the welfare of captive social \nanimals. \n \nKeywords: Social memory; Rat; Retroactive interference; Social recognition 40 \n 2\nIntroduction \n 42 \n44 \n46 \n48 \n50 \n52 \n54 \n56 \n58 \n60 \n62 \n64 \nSocial memory, the ability of an animal to encode, retain, and refer to information \nconcerning the identity of a conspecific over time, is likely to be crucial for the \ndetermination and maintenance of social structure in many animal species, \nparticularly those living in small, stable social groups (e.g. Caldwell, 1985; Pagel and \nDawkins, 1997). Yet, in contrast to the large amount of research on the abilities of \nnon-human animals to discriminate between conspecifics (e.g. monkeys: Dasser, \n1988; chickens: Bradshaw, 1991; rodents: Gheusi et al., 1994a; sheep: Kendrick et al., \n1996; invertebrates: Karavanich and Atema, 1998), less attention has been directed \ntowards social memory itself. \n \nThe disruption of cognitive function by stressful elements from both housing \nand husbandry systems could have potentially serious implications for the welfare of \ndomesticates and captive wild animals (Mendl, in press). For example, if social \nmemory is disrupted by husbandry procedures such as the removal and subsequent \nreintroduction of individuals from previously stable social groups, then the \nsubsequent recognition failure may underlie the observed increase in aggression, and \ndecline in welfare due to injury, which occurs when previously familiar animals are \nreintroduced (e.g. Ewbank and Meese, 1971). This raises questions about the potential \nstability of social memory in the face of interference resulting from environmental \ndisturbances. Recent work on pigs has demonstrated that elements of common \nhusbandry procedures can have a disruptive effect on the retention of a spatial \nlearning task (Mendl et al., 1997; Laughlin et al., 1999). Here, we extend this work to \ninvestigate whether such procedures can interfere with social memory in rats. \n 3\n 66 \n68 \n70 \n72 \n74 \n76 \n78 \n80 \n82 \n84 \n86 \n88 \n90 \nResearch investigating the effect of retroactive interference, the way in which \nan event introduced after an initial task can reduce subsequent performance of that \ntask (e.g. Rodriguez et al., 1993), has revealed that spatial memory in rats appears \nresistant to disruption when the interpolated (\u2018between-tests\u2019) event is different to the \noriginal learned task (e.g. Maki et al., 1979). However, if there is a large amount of \ninterpolated experience, or if the interpolated event is very similar to the original task, \nit does appear that interference can occur (Roberts, 1981). Social memory studies \nhave also found that interference can be induced by an interpolated event very similar \nto the original task. For example, when a new individual is introduced in the period \nduring which another individual has to be remembered (e.g. Thor and Holloway, \n1982; Dantzer et al., 1987).  \n \nIn this study we therefore investigated whether social memory, like spatial \nmemory, appears resistant to interference when the interpolated event is different to \nthe original learned task. This information would thus allow us to compare between \nproperties of the spatial and social memory systems. It would also allow us to \ninvestigate whether environmental disturbances, such as those commonly involved as \npart of husbandry or experimental procedures, can interfere with the social memory of \nlaboratory rats. This study therefore has direct implications for the welfare of \nlaboratory rats, and, if the rat is considered as a model species, may also have \nimplications for the welfare of other captive social animals. \n \nGeneral methods \n \n 4\nSubjects, housing and care \n 92 \n94 \n96 \n98 \n100 \n102 \n104 \n106 \n108 \n110 \n112 \n114 \nThe subjects were unrelated male Lister Hooded rats (Harlan UK Limited), 12 \nat three months of age, and 10 at two months of age. We used two different ages of \nadult rats so that all the adults could undergo pre-experimental training \nsimultaneously, but at testing all the rats would be the same age (3-months-old). \nThirty two juvenile male Lister Hooded rats, 21 days old at the start of the \nexperiment, were used as social stimuli. The time schedule was designed to ensure \nthat the experiments were completed before the juveniles reached sexual maturation at \naround 50 days old (Wolfensohn and Lloyd, 1994). All the rats were housed \nindividually in standard laboratory cages (33 X 50 X 21cm) with sawdust bedding and \nan enrichment toy. Food (Harlan Teklad Laboratory Diet) and water were provided ad \nlibitum. The temperature of the experimental room was controlled (19\u00b0c \u00b1 1), and \nmaintained on a reverse dark-light cycle (light on from 1900-0700 hours), with \nobservations carried out in the dark phase of the cycle. Red light (60 Watt) allowed \nthe observer to see the rats. The rats were all handled for approximately 15 seconds \neach day, for one week prior to the start of the experiment. This was intended to \nfamiliarise the subjects to short bouts of handling, in order that transfer of animals \nbetween cages during experiments had minimal effect on behaviour. We used \ndisposable gloves when handling the rats during the experiment, in order to reduce the \nchance of odour transfer. \n \nThe social recognition test \n \nThis test, developed by Thor and Holloway (1982), is based on the natural \n 5\ninvestigative behaviour of a rat, in which a rat shows a preference for investigating a \nnovel conspecific over a familiar one (e.g. Carr et al., 1976). Social discrimination in \nrats is regulated by the presence of olfactory cues (e.g. Sawyer et al., 1984), and \ninvestigation therefore takes the form of sniffing of the social stimulus, particularly \nfocusing on the ano-genital region (Carr et al., 1976). The test is based upon a \ncomparison of behaviour, particularly investigation, between two exposures of the \nsame individual to a subject animal, separated by an inter-exposure interval (IEI). A \ndecrease in investigation in the second exposure implies recognition of the individual. \nNo decrease suggests that the subject\u2019s social memory for that individual has decayed \nover the IEI, and is the response seen when a novel individual is introduced in the \nsecond exposure. This demonstrates that any reduction in investigation is due to \nrecognition of, and habituation to, a reintroduced stimulus, rather than a non-specific \ndecrease in the motivation to investigate a conspecific per se. \n116 \n118 \n120 \n122 \n124 \n126 \n128 \n130 \n132 \n134 \n136 \n138 \n140 \n \nA benefit of this test is that it relies on spontaneous behaviour of the rat, but \nthis also results in a less controlled experimental environment than those tests using \noperant techniques (e.g. Gheusi et al., 1997). It is also unclear what cues the rats are \nremembering and using for the discrimination. In addition to olfactory cues, rats could \nbe discriminating on the basis of visual and auditory, especially ultrasonic, cues (e.g. \nLore and Flannelly, 1977; Sales, 1991). Studies have indicated that it is unlikely, \nhowever, that odour deposition, either by the adults on the juveniles, or by the \njuveniles in the home cages of the adults, influences the outcome of the social \nrecognition test (e.g. Sawyer et al., 1984; Perio et al., 1989).  \n \nAlthough this study was not designed to provoke aggression between animals, \n 6\nthere was a risk of aggression occurring during the social recognition test. To \nminimise this risk, juveniles were used as stimuli because previous studies had \nindicated that immature juveniles elicit little or no aggressive behaviour from adult \nrats (e.g. Thor, 1979). Other researchers state that although juveniles can be \nintimidated by adults, physical injury is rare (Lore and Flannelly, 1977). We found \nthat aggression did occur, but at no point in this study was injury caused by mild \naggression, defined as rolling and standing over the juvenile and\/or pushing it away. \nA researcher was always present to ensure that if overt aggression occurred, e.g. \nbiting, the encounter was abandoned immediately, with individuals separated before \nany injury was possible. Those juveniles who experienced overt aggression appeared \nto show no subsequent long-term effects, with normal behaviour and food\/water \nconsumption observed. \n142 \n144 \n146 \n148 \n150 \n152 \n154 \n156 \n158 \n160 \n162 \n164 \n \nBehavioural observations \n \nDuring each exposure of a juvenile to an adult subject rat, the total amount of \ninvestigation and mild aggression, in seconds, expressed by the subject during the \ncourse of the test period was continuously recorded by video camera and hand held \nevent recorder (Psion Organiser II), using Noldus Observer software (Noldus \nInformation Technology 1993). Investigation of the juvenile by the adult was defined \nas when the adult was nosing, grooming, sniffing, or following within one centimetre \nof the juvenile (Thor and Holloway, 1982). Mild aggression consisted of rolling and \nstanding over the juvenile, and\/or pushing it away.  \n \n 7\nPre-experimental training \n 166 \n168 \n170 \n172 \n174 \n176 \n178 \n180 \n182 \n184 \n186 \n188 \nThe fact that, following a 5-min initial exposure, a male adult rat typically \nrecognises a juvenile after an IEI of 30min, but fails to recognise a juvenile after \n120min, is often taken as a standard measure of social recognition (e.g. Dantzer et al., \n1987; Gheusi et al., 1994b). But there are instances where recognition does not appear \nto occur after a 30-min IEI, notably in sexually inexperienced, young (3-months-old) \nadult males (e.g. Hlinak and Krejci, 1991; Engelmann et al., 1995). For this reason we \nmade preliminary observations during pre-experimental training, to ensure that the \ninitial exposure and IEI length selected for the disturbance experiments allowed \nsuccessful recognition.  \n \nThis also allowed us to remove not only any overtly aggressive rats, but those \nwhich failed to investigate the juveniles reliably. The pre-experimental training \nsession consisted of an exposure to the same juvenile, once a day for four consecutive \ndays. Half the adults received exposures of 5-min duration, the remainder received \nexposures of 15min. We introduced a novel juvenile on the fifth day, followed by re-\nexposure to the original juvenile on the sixth day. A second exposure on the sixth day \nof the same original juvenile to the adults, after a short inter-exposure interval of \neither 15 or 25 minutes, was designed to reveal which combination of initial exposure \nand inter-exposure interval lengths was most suitable for use in the main experiments \nreported here. \n \nExperiment one \n \n 8\nThis experiment was designed to investigate the effect of introducing different \npotentially disturbing environmental stimuli, (see Table 1), on the social memory of \nlaboratory rats. \n190 \n192 \n194 \n196 \n198 \n200 \n202 \n204 \n206 \n208 \n210 \n212 \n214 \n \n*Table One* \n \nThese treatments, excluding the control treatment (treatment A), were selected \nas being representative of elements of commonly occurring husbandry\/experimental \nprocedures. If these treatments were found to have a disruptive effect on the social \nmemory of laboratory rats, then this could have important implications for the welfare \nof these animals, and the accuracy of some experimental research (see Introduction). \n \nMethod \n \nTwo of the 12 potential subjects (3-months-old) for this experiment were \nexcluded due to inappropriate behaviour during pre-experimental training. One was \ntoo aggressive, and the other investigated the juvenile stimulus unreliably, displaying \napparently submissive behaviour. We therefore used 10 rats in two replicates (N=5 \nper replicate).  \n \nThe results obtained from pre-experimental training suggested the chosen \ntiming regime. The experimental procedure consisted of an initial 5-min exposure of a \nparticular juvenile to a resident adult e.g. \u201cA\u00b9\u201d, followed by a 15-min IEI before \nreintroduction of the same juvenile, \u201cA\u00b2\u201d, (see Fig. 1). After 5min of the IEI, each \nadult was exposed to its particular treatment for a 5-min period. Each adult \n 9\nexperienced the procedure once on each experimental day. The effect of treatment \norder on the behaviour of the subject animals was taken into account by using a Latin \nsquare design (5 X 5). This experimental design also ensured that the number of \nanimals used was minimised (Still, 1982). The two replicates were tested on alternate \ndays such that each rat received all five of the treatments, one every other day, the \norder determined by the Latin square. All exposures to the juvenile stimuli took place \nin the home cage of the subjects. Sixteen juveniles were required in total, with adults \nencountering a different juvenile on all five test days, and no juvenile used more than \nonce for the same treatment. All the juvenile stimuli were entirely novel to the \nsubjects.  \n216 \n218 \n220 \n222 \n224 \n226 \n228 \n230 \n232 \n234 \n236 \n238 \n \n*Figure One* \n \nInvestigation and mildly aggressive behaviour were recorded for analysis (see \nearlier). The novel environments (treatments D & E) were wiped down with a mild \ndisinfectant before the introduction of the adult rats in order to reduce the possible \ninfluence of lingering odours. \n \nData analysis \n \n Data (N=10) were assessed for normality and homogeneity of variance, and \nthose that failed to meet these criteria underwent logarithmic transformation. Pre-\ntreatment behaviour was analysed first, to ensure that there were no pre-treatment \ndifferences between the treatment groups. The difference between pre-treatment and \npost-treatment behaviour was then calculated (first - second exposure) and analysed. \n 10\nThe difference in the total amount of behaviour displayed during each of the two \nexposures to the juvenile was used as a measure of behavioural change, because other \nmeasures, such as ratios (e.g. Perio et al., 1989), can fail to uncover differences in the \nabsolute size of response. The data were analysed initially using a GLM for repeated \nmeasures, with treatment (1-5) and pre-experimental training experience (5 or 15min) \nas factors. Paired t-tests were used to investigate specific differences within individual \ntreatments. The statistical package used was Minitab (Minitab Inc. 1996). \n240 \n242 \n244 \n246 \n248 \n250 \n252 \n254 \n256 \n258 \n260 \n262 \n264 \n \nResults \n \nThere was no difference between the five treatments in the amount of either \ninvestigation (F4,32=1.39, N.S.) or mild aggression (F4,32=1.11, N.S.) expressed pre-\ntreatment. There was also no effect of previous experience, or any interaction between \nexperience and treatment, for either investigation or mild aggression. When the \ndifference in behaviour between the two exposures was analysed, a significant effect \nof treatment on investigation was found (F4,32=2.75, P<0.05), but no effect on mild \naggression (F4,32=1.42, N.S.). Again, there was no effect of previous experience, or \ninteraction between experience and treatment, for either investigation of mild \naggression. \n \n*Figure Two* \n \nPaired t-tests were used in order to ascertain in what way each of the \ntreatments were influencing the change in investigative behaviour between the first \nand second exposures (see Fig. 2). No significant change in investigation was \n 11\nobserved between exposures for treatments B (handling), C (novel conspecific) or D \n(small novel environment). But a significant decrease in investigation was seen for \nboth treatment A (control) (T=2.98, N=9, P<0.05) and treatment E (novel \nenvironment) (T=4.19, N=9, P<0.001). It therefore seems that the treatments had \ndifferent effects on the investigative behaviour of the subject rats. \n266 \n268 \n270 \n272 \n274 \n276 \n278 \n280 \n282 \n284 \n286 \n288 \n \nDiscussion \n \nThese results suggest that during both the control and novel environment \ntreatments the rats retained a memory of the juvenile conspecific over the 15-min \ninter-exposure interval. The introduction of the rats to a novel environment of similar \nsize to their home cage did not appear, therefore, to disrupt their social memory. The \nremaining treatments, however, did appear to disrupt social memory. The apparent \ninterference effect of a novel conspecific confirmed the results of previous studies \n(Thor and Holloway, 1982; Dantzer et al., 1987). There appeared to be no effect of \ndifferent pre-experimental training experience on the subsequent behaviour of the \nadult subjects. \n \nThe introduction of a novel conspecific is the treatment most closely linked \nwith the \u2018learning task\u2019 itself, and may directly compete with information stored about \nthe original juvenile. Differences in the effect on behaviour between the two novel \nenvironment treatments suggest that the increased confinement of the smaller \nenvironment was likely to have been the cause of the observed disruption of social \nmemory. The subject rats had experienced only brief bouts of handling prior to the \nimplementation of the handling treatment. It is therefore possible that an increase in \n 12\nstress caused by this treatment resulted in a disruption of social memory. It should be \nnoted that because each treatment was implemented half way through the IEI, they \nmight have affected either memory consolidation or recall (see Mendl, in press).  \n290 \n292 \n294 \n296 \n298 \n300 \n302 \n304 \n306 \n308 \n310 \n312 \n314 \n \nAn alternative explanation for the observed results is that the treatments \ncaused the investigative behaviour of the rats in the second exposure to rise above the \nexpected habituated levels despite an intact social memory, possibly by affecting non-\nspecific states of arousal or motivation. Attempting to determine whether treatments \nhave disrupted social memory or provoked an increase in motivation or arousal is \nproblematic. For example, one might expect an aroused adult to investigate a novel \njuvenile introduced for the second exposure significantly more than if the original \njuvenile had been reintroduced. But even if this was the case it may still not prove \nconclusively that the treatment was having an arousing effect, as significant increases \nin investigation can occur upon the introduction of a novel juvenile even when no \ntreatment has occurred (e.g. Sekiguchi et al., 1991). Because of this difficulty, we \nfocused our attention on treatment E (novel environment), which had not appeared to \ndisrupt social memory. \n \nExperiment two \n \nThis experiment was designed to confirm the findings of experiment one, and \ninvestigate the effect of treatment disturbance on the social memory of the subject rats \nby comparing behaviour following reintroduction of the original juvenile stimulus \n(A\u00b2) with that following the introduction of a novel juvenile (B) (see Fig. 3). In the \nprevious experiment we observed that the removal of an adult rat from its home cage \n 13\nto a large novel environment apparently failed to disrupt the social memory of that rat \nfor a juvenile conspecific, allowing recognition. Alternative explanations for this \nresult are that the juvenile was not actually recognised, but that investigation was \nreduced either because of the adult habituating to the experimental procedure, or the \ntreatment itself acting to suppress behaviour. Both of these explanations also predict a \nsimilar reduction in investigative behaviour if a novel juvenile is introduced for the \nsecond exposure, whereas an increase in investigation might be expected if no \ndisruption to social memory is occurring. The same technique has been used to \ndistinguish between non-specific and specific effects of drug treatments on social \nmemory (e.g. Perio et al., 1989; Gheusi et al., 1994b). \n316 \n318 \n320 \n322 \n324 \n326 \n328 \n330 \n332 \n334 \n336 \n338 \n \n*Figure Three* \n \nIn this experiment, four treatments were used (see Table 2). \n \n*Table Two* \n \nMethod \n \nTwo of the 10 rats, previously 2-months-old, were excluded because of overt \naggression during pre-experimental training, so eight rats, now three months old, were \nused. Two replicates (N=4) of a Latin square design (4 X 4) were used to assign \ntreatment order across time, and 16 juveniles were used in total. As before, all \njuveniles were introduced only twice a day, were used for different treatments each \nday, and were entirely novel to the particular adult to whom they were introduced. \n 14\nThe two replicates were tested on alternate days such that each rat received all four of \nthe treatments, one every other day, with treatment order determined by the Latin \nsquare design. The novel environment was cleaned with a mild disinfectant between \nuses. Investigation of, and mild aggression directed towards, the juvenile was \nrecorded. \n340 \n342 \n344 \n346 \n348 \n350 \n352 \n354 \n356 \n358 \n360 \n362 \n364 \n \nData analysis \n \n Data (N=8) were treated as before (see experiment one).  \n \nResults \n \nNo significant difference between the four treatments types in the relative \namounts of either investigation or mild aggression was observed pre-treatment. There \nwas also no effect of previous experience, or any interaction between experience and \ntreatment, for either investigation or mild aggression. \n \n*Figure Four and Figure Five* \n \nPaired t-tests were used to investigate exactly how the different treatments \neach affected investigation and mild aggression. Significant changes in the amount of \ninvestigation between the two exposures to the juvenile stimuli were discovered for \nthree out of the four treatments (see Fig. 4). Treatment one (no interference, same \njuvenile reintroduced) (T=4.00, N=7, P<0.01) and treatment two (novel environment, \nsame juvenile reintroduced) (T=2.76, N=7, P<0.05) both showed significant \n 15\nreductions in the amount of investigation between exposures, whereas treatment three \n(no interference, novel juvenile introduced) displayed a significant increase in \ninvestigative behaviour (T=-2.83, N=7, P<0.05). Investigation also increased in \ntreatment four (novel environment, novel juvenile introduced), and this increase was \nnearly significant (T=-2.24, N=7, P=0.06). The only significant change in the amount \nof mild aggression observed, was an increase in mild aggression following the \nimplementation of treatment one (no interference, same juvenile reintroduced) (T=-\n2.43, N=7, P<0.05) (see Fig.5). \n366 \n368 \n370 \n372 \n374 \n376 \n378 \n380 \n382 \n384 \n386 \n388 \n \nDiscussion \n \nThese results confirmed the findings of experiment one in which treatments A \n(no interference, same juvenile reintroduced) and E (novel environment, same \njuvenile reintroduced), showed similar decreases in investigation, suggesting that, for \nboth those treatments, the adult rats recognised the juveniles reintroduced into their \nhome cages. \n \n The results also demonstrate that any observed reduction in the amount of \ninvestigation of the juvenile by the adult rat was due primarily to the habituation of \nthe subject to the stimulus, i.e. recognition, rather than because of any behaviour \nsuppressing property of the treatment, or general habituation to the experimental \nprocedure. This emphasises the importance of introducing a novel juvenile as a \ncontrol to distinguish between specific and non-specific effects of treatment (e.g. \nPerio et al., 1989; Gheusi et al., 1994b). \n \n 16\nGeneral discussion 390 \n392 \n394 \n396 \n398 \n400 \n402 \n404 \n406 \n408 \n410 \n412 \n414 \n \nThe results of experiment one indicate that the implementation of some elements of \ncommon husbandry\/experimental procedures appears to be sufficient to disrupt the \nshort-term social memory of an adult laboratory rat, although we are as yet unable to \ncompletely rule out the possible effects of these environmental stimuli on non-specific \nstates of arousal or motivation. Removal to a large novel environment did not appear \nto interfere with the social memory of the adult rats, and experiment two confirmed \nthat any reduction in the total amount of observed investigation was unlikely to be \ndue to behavioural suppression or motivational change. \n \nOther researchers have observed anecdotally that the way animals are handled \ncan be important for minimising variation in baseline investigation times (Dantzer et \nal., 1987), and that removal from the home cage between exposures fails to interfere \nwith subsequent recognition (Perio et al., 1989). This paper, in contrast, specifically \ninvestigated the effects of mild environmental stimuli on social memory, and \ntherefore has implications for the use of the social recognition test in research. \nExperiments that apparently indicate recognition failure may actually result as a side \neffect of the experimental technique itself, i.e. excessive handling, rather than because \nof the specific treatment. The influence of these external factors should therefore be \ntaken into account. The findings of this experiment also reflect work on the disruption \nof spatial memory in pigs (e.g. Mendl et al., 1997; Laughlin et al., 1999) and \ndemonstrate that, at least in the short term, social memory in rats can be disrupted. \nThe exact way in which the memory has been disturbed is more open to question. The \nintroduction of an environmental stimulus shortly after the learning task may disrupt \n 17\nmemory formation, or, once the social memory for a particular individual has been \nformed, the introduction of an environmental stimulus may act to block attempts to \nretrieve the retained memory (Mendl, in press). \n416 \n418 \n420 \n422 \n424 \n426 \n428 \n430 \n432 \n434 \n436 \n438 \n \nWhen compared to the spatial memory of rats, social memory appears more \nsusceptible to disruption, even by relatively mild environmental stimuli. There may be \nspecies specific reasons for this apparent discrepancy. For a group living animal like \nthe wild rat (Barnett 1963) it is perhaps only worth forming a lasting memory of \nanother individual if there is a high probability of repeat encounters with the same \nindividual over a short space of time (Caldwell 1985), particularly if this recognition \nforms the basis for a dominance hierarchy (Pagel & Dawkins 1997). This may be \ndifficult for a rat to evaluate on a first encounter, so it may not be cost-effective to \nkeep forming a memory of a new individual on the first meeting, as that same \nindividual may never be encountered again. There is strong biological foundation for \nthe notion that maintenance of accurate memories requires substantial resource \nexpenditure (Dukas 1998). In direct contrast to social memory, spatial memory needs \nto be more immediately resistant to disturbance over the short-term. The location of a \nfood source or a potential nest site, and routes to and away from familiar areas, must \ninstantly be stored in memory otherwise the animal could starve or become lost. There \nis therefore potentially a far greater requirement for spatial memory to be remembered \nin the short-term because of the greater cost to the animal of memory failure. One \ncould therefore predict that spatial memory is less susceptible to disturbance over \nshort-term than social memory, as found, but that social memory will become \nincreasingly resistant to disruption after long term formation. One might also predict \nthat those individuals who \u2018mean\u2019 more to a specific individual will be remembered \n 18\nfaster and be more resistant to disruption than those with little, or no, meaning, i.e. the \nreferent of the social stimulus may have a direct effect on the way it is processed. \n440 \n442 \n444 \n446 \n448 \n450 \n452 \n454 \n456 \n458 \n460 \n462 \n464 \n \nConclusions \n \nThese results could have implications for the welfare of both laboratory rats \nand other captive social animals. The removal of an individual rat from a social group \nfollowed by the inadvertent introduction of a potentially disruptive environmental \nstimulus, may mean that upon return to its social group the rat is unable to recognise \nits former companions, resulting in an increase in aggression and corresponding \nreduction in welfare. However, this study looked only at the effects of environmental \ndisturbance on short-term social memory. It is likely that with a longer initial \nexposure, social memory will become more resistant to disruption. It is therefore \nessential that the current work is followed up by investigation into more long-term \nsocial memory. \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThis research was supported by a University of Bristol Postgraduate Scholarship.
