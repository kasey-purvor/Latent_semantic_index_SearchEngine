Moreover, this sum rule is supported by the\nexisting neutrino\u2013nucleon DIS data, which show no significant Q2 variation in the range\n2 GeV2 \u2264 Q2 \u2264 30 GeV2 and give [3]\nIexpA = 2.02\u00b1 0.40 . (2)\nThough the error-bars are quite large, the precision could in principle be improved by\nfuture \u03bdN DIS experiments at neutrino factories (for discussion of such a program, see\nRef.[4]).\nWithin the quark-parton model, the corresponding isospin sum rule in the case of\ncharged-lepton\u2013nucleon DIS has the form\nIG(Q\n2) \u2261\n\u222b 1\n0\ndx\nx\n[\nF \u2113p2 (x,Q\n2)\u2212 F \u2113n2 (x,Q\n2)\n]\n(3)\n=\n1\n3\n\u222b 1\n0\ndx\n(\nu(x)\u2212 d(x) + u(x)\u2212 d(x)\n)\n=\n1\n3\n\u2212\n2\n3\n\u222b 1\n0\ndx\n(\nd(x)\u2212 u(x)\n)\n.\nIf the nucleon sea were flavour symmetric, with u(x) = d(x), we would obtain the original\nGottfried sum rule [5], IG =\n1\n3\n, in strong disagreement with the most detailed analysis of\nmuon\u2013nucleon DIS data, by the NMC collaboration, which gave the following result [6]:\nIG(Q\n2 = 4 GeV2) = 0.235\u00b1 0.026 . (4)\nIn contrast to the Adler sum rule, the original quark-parton model expression for the\nGottfried sum rule is modified by perturbative QCD contributions, analyzed numerically\nat the \u03b12s-level in Ref.[7]. These corrections turn out to be small and cannot be responsible\nfor the significant discrepancy between IG and the naive expectation of\n1\n3\n. This discrepancy\ncan be associated with the existence of non-perturbative effects in the nucleon sea, which\ngenerate light-quark flavour asymmetry, and lead to the inequality u(x,Q2) < d(x,Q2)\nover significant ranges of the Bjorken variable x (for reviews, see Refs.[8, 9, 10]).\nIn this paper we examine the QCD corrections to the moments of parton-model den-\nsities, for non-singlet neutrino and charged-lepton DIS, with the N = 1 moments cor-\nresponding to the Adler and Gottfried sum rules, and comment upon a striking feature\nwhich they exhibit in the large-Nc limit [11] at the two-loop level.\n1\n2 Radiative corrections at large Nc\nFirst we present an analytical result for the two-loop radiative correction that was evalu-\nated numerically in Ref.[7] and then comment on its structure as Nc \u2192\u221e.\n2.1 Analytical two-loop correction to the Gottfried sum rule\nFollowing Ref.[7], we write the radiative corrections to the N = 1 non-singlet charged-\nlepton moment of Eq. (3), in the case of light-quark flavour symmetry, as\nIG = A(\u03b1s)C\n(\u2113)(\u03b1s) , (5)\nwith an anomalous-dimension term\nA(\u03b1s) = 1 +\n1\n8\n\u03b3N=11\n\u03b20\n(\n\u03b1s\n\u03c0\n)\n(6)\n+\n1\n64\n(\n1\n2\n(\u03b3N=11 )\n2\n\u03b220\n\u2212\n\u03b3N=11 \u03b21\n\u03b220\n+\n\u03b3N=12\n\u03b20\n)(\n\u03b1s\n\u03c0\n)2\n+O(\u03b13s) ,\nwhere \u03b20 and \u03b21 are the first two scheme-independent coefficients of the QCD \u03b2-function,\nnamely\n\u03b20 =\n(\n11\n3\nCA \u2212\n2\n3\nNF\n)\n(7)\n\u03b21 =\n(\n34\n3\nC2A \u2212 2CFNF \u2212\n10\n3\nCANF\n)\n, (8)\nwith NF active flavours and Casimir operators CF = (N\n2\nc \u2212 1)\/(2Nc) and CA = Nc, in the\nfundamental and adjoint representations of SU(Nc).\nThe one-loop anomalous dimension vanishes and the leading correction from the two-\nloop result of Ref.[12], confirmed in Ref.[13], has the form\n\u03b3N=11 = \u22124(C\n2\nF \u2212 CFCA\/2) [13 + 8\u03b6(3)\u2212 12\u03b6(2)] \u2248 2.557552 , (9)\nwith two conspicuous features:\n\u2022 the appearance of \u03b6(2) = \u03c02\/6, which is absent from even non-singlet moments of\nthe charged-lepton\u2013nucleon structure function F2, and from odd moments of the\ncorresponding neutrino\u2013nucleon structure function, but occurs at odd moments for\ncharged-lepton scattering, and at even moments for neutrino scattering, by analytic\ncontinuation in N of results from QCD Feynman diagrams [13];\n\u2022 the distinctive non-planar colour-factor, (C2F \u2212 CFCA\/2) = O(N\n0\nc ), which exhibits\nan O(1\/N2c ) suppression at large-Nc, in comparison with the individual weights C\n2\nF\nand CFCA, which are associated with planar two-loop diagrams that do not show\nthis large-Nc cancellation at two loops [13] for moments N > 1. Nor is there any\nsign of such large-Nc cancellation in the three-loop results of [14], obtained for even\nmoments.\n2\nThe second factor in Eq. (5) comes from radiative corrections to the coefficient function,\nof the form\nC(\u2113)(\u03b1s) =\n1\n3\n[\n1 + C\n(\u2113)N=1\n1\n(\n\u03b1s\n\u03c0\n)\n+ C\n(\u2113)N=1\n2\n(\n\u03b1s\n\u03c0\n)2\n+O(\u03b13s)\n]\n(10)\nwith a vanishing one-loop term, C\n(\u2113)N=1\n1 = 0 [15]. The scheme-independent two-loop coef-\nficient C\n(\u2113)N=1\n2 can be defined through the general non-singlet Mellin moment of charged-\nlepton\u2013nucleon (\u2113) DIS scattering\nC\n(\u2113)N\n2 = 3\n\u222b 1\n0\ndx\n[\nC(2),(+)(x, 1) + C(2),(\u2212)(x, 1)\n]\nxN\u22121 (11)\ntaken at N = 1, where the expressions for the functions C(2),(\u2212)(x, 1) and C(2),(+)(x, 1)\nwere given in Ref.[16] and confirmed later with the help of another technique in Ref.[17].\nThe \u201c1\u201d in the argument of these functions denotes the choice of renormalization scale\n\u00b52 = Q2, where \u00b52 is associated to the MS-scheme and the coupling \u03b1s is evaluated at Q\n2.\nExplicit numerical integration of the N = 1 moment of Eq. (11) gave the result [7]\nC\n(\u2113)N=1\n2 = 3.695C\n2\nF \u2212 1.847CFCA , (12)\nwith a contribution from the colour factor CFNF which was consistent with zero, to the\naccuracy of that numerical work. At the time, the approximate emergence in Eq. (12) of\nthe same non-planar structure (C2F \u2212 CFCA\/2), already observed in the two-loop N = 1\nanomalous dimension coefficient of Eq. (9), went unremarked. Now we are able to derive\nan exact result, by comparing the charged-lepton moments (11) with the corresponding\nnon-singlet moments of the F2 structure function for neutrino\u2013nucleon (\u03bd) DIS, which can\nalso be expressed in terms of the functions C(2),(\u2212)(x, 1) and C(2),(+)(x, 1), but now in the\ncombination\nC\n(\u03bd)N\n2 =\n1\n2\n\u222b 1\n0\ndx\n[\nC(2),(+)(x, 1)\u2212 C(2),(\u2212)(x, 1)\n]\nxN\u22121 . (13)\nTo obtain an analytic expression for the correction (11) to the Gottfried sum rule we\nremark that the N = 1 case of the moment (13) corresponds to the Adler sum rule, which\nis free of radiative corrections. Hence, C\n(\u03bd)N=1\n2 = 0 and by elimination of\u222b 1\n0\ndxC(2),(+)(x, 1) =\n\u222b 1\n0\ndxC(2),(\u2212)(x, 1) (14)\nwe obtain\nC\n(\u2113)N=1\n2 = 2\u00d7 3\n\u222b 1\n0\ndxC(2),(\u2212)(x, 1) . (15)\nNoting that the C(2),(\u2212)(x, 1) term in Ref.[16] is explicitly proportional to CF (CF \u2212CA\/2),\nwe are left with a single integration over x, multiplied by this distinctive non-planar colour\nstructure. Unlike the contributions from C(2),(+)(x, 1), this integral is free of singularities\nas x\u2192 1, and hence requires no regularization. The integrand involves trilogarithms, but\nelementary integration by parts reduces it to a regular integral whose integrand involves\n3\nnothing more complicated than the product of dilogarithms and logarithms. Maple then\nprovided a speedy evaluation of the numerical coefficient of CF (CF\u2212CA\/2) to 20 significant\nfigures, for which we readily found a simple fit with a rational linear combination of\nthe expected structures {1, \u03b6(2), \u03b6(3), \u03b6(4)}. Increasing the accuracy of integration to 30\nsignificant figures we confirmed, with overwhelming confidence, the analytical form\nC\n(\u2113)N=1\n2 =\n[\n\u2212\n141\n32\n+\n21\n4\n\u03b6(2)\u2212\n45\n4\n\u03b6(3) + 12\u03b6(4)\n]\nCF (CF \u2212 CA\/2) (16)\n\u2248 3.69439249494141137892516966638 CF (CF \u2212 CA\/2) ,\nwhich validates the first 3 significant figures of the approximate terms of Eq. (12), obtained\nin Ref.[7] by the far more difficult procedure of evaluating an integral in Eq. (11) that has\nthree apparently distinct colour factors and requires delicate regularization at the singular\nendpoint, x = 1, of the C(2),(+)(x, 1) function, interpreted as a distribution.\nWe now interpret the vanishing of the one-loop corrections to the anomalous dimension\nand coefficient function of the N = 1 non-singlet moment of charged-lepton\u2013nucleon DIS\nstructure functions as a simple consequence of the vanishing of all radiative corrections\nto the Adler sum rule and the absence of a non-planar one-loop diagram that distin-\nguishes charged-lepton scattering from neutrino scattering. As already remarked, this\nmakes the two-loop anomalous dimension coefficient \u03b3N=11 and the two-loop correction\nC\n(\u2113)N=1\n2 scheme-independent. The first place that scheme-dependence may appear is in\nthe three-loop anomalous dimension coefficient \u03b3N=12 , which appears in Eq. (6) at order\n\u03b12s, albeit divided by \u03b20. This contribution is in the process of calculation (see for example\nRef.[18]). We expect its contribution to be small in the MS-scheme, for reasons discussed\nin Ref.[7], based on experience of next-to-next-to-leading order fits [19] to the data on xF3\nin \u03bdN DIS from the CCFR collaboration.\nMoreover we offer our first conjecture, which is that the 6 possible colour structures in\nthe three-loop term \u03b3N=12 will occur only in those 3 combinations suppressed in the large-\nNc limit, namely C\n2\nF (CF \u2212CA\/2), CFCA(CF \u2212CA\/2) and CF (CF \u2212CA\/2)NF . If this guess\nturns out to be wrong, then much of our subsequent discussion will become questionable.\nIt should be noted that this conjecture applies exclusively to the N = 1 moment of the\nnon-singlet charged-lepton structure function F2. We derive it from the wider hypothesis\nthat the differences between non-singlet moments of F2 in charged-lepton scattering and\nneutrino scattering will continue to exhibit non-planar suppressions, beyond the two-loop\norder at which we have observed them. Then the suppression of \u03b3N=12 in charged-lepton\nscattering at large Nc becomes a special consequence of the complete vanishing of radiative\ncorrections to the Adler sum rule.\nWe also note how quickly the two-loop corrections change their colour structure when\none considers moments with N > 1. For example the ratio\nRN2 \u2261\nC\n(\u2113)N\n2 \u2212 6C\n(\u03bd)N\n2\nC\n(\u2113)N\n2 + 6C\n(\u03bd)N\n2\n=\n\u222b 1\n0 dxC\n(2),(\u2212)(x, 1)xN\u22121\u222b 1\n0 dxC\n(2),(+)(x, 1)xN\u22121\n(17)\nis forced to take the value RN=12 = 1 at N = 1, by virtue of the vanishing of radiative\n4\ncorrections to the Adler sum rule. But for N = 2, we obtained from Ref.[17] the ratio\nRN=22 = \u2212\n0.505931104\n5.4183241N2c \u2212 4NcNF \u2212 8.4480127\n(18)\nwhich is negative and small in magnitude at large Nc, and also at Nc = 3 with NF = 3\nactive flavours, where it takes the value RN=22 = \u22120.117197668. Moreover the magnitude of\nRN2 continues to decrease very rapidly with the moment-number, N , because the integral in\nthe numerator of Eq. (17) has an integrand that is strongly suppressed as x\u2192 1. Similarly,\nwe expect the currently known results for the charged-lepton anomalous dimension \u03b3N2 , at\nseveral even values of N , to give little guidance as to the eventual value at N = 1, which\nmust be obtained by analytic continuation of a complete set of even-N results.\n2.2 Planar approximation, renormalons and 1\/Q2 corrections\nThe limit Nc \u2192\u221e and the 1\/Nc-expansion [11] are known to be rather useful for analyzing\nthe non-perturbative structure of QCD. Here we will use this framework to characterize\nour conjecture about the perturbative corrections and then seek a non-perturbative con-\nsequence.\nTo do this, we use the planar approximation formulated in Ref.[20]. In this approx-\nimation one retains, after extracting an overall factor of CF , only those terms at order\n(\u03b1s\/\u03c0)\nn that contain the leading Nc behaviour for each possible power of NF . In the case\nof the order (\u03b1s\/\u03c0)\nn contribution to the coefficient function of Eq. (10) this prescription\nthen amounts to selecting\nC(\u2113)N=1n |planar = CF\nn\u22121\u2211\ni=0\nC\n(\u2113)N=1\nn,i N\nn\u22121\u2212i\nF N\ni\nc , (19)\nwhere the C\n(\u2113)N=1\nn,i are pure numbers. By definition, the planar approximation differs from\nreality by (at most) terms of order 1\/N2c . So far we have seen that C\n(\u2113)N=1\n1,0 = 0, since there\nis no one-loop correction to the coefficient function, and that C\n(\u2113)N=1\n2,1 = C\n(\u2113)N=1\n2,0 = 0, since\nonly the colour structure CF (CF \u2212 CA\/2) = \u2212\n1\n2\nCFN\n\u22121\nc survives at two-loop order in this\nmoment, because of the vanishing of all radiative corrections to the Adler sum rule and the\nappearance of a non-planar factor in the difference between charged-lepton and neutrino\nstructure functions at two loops. Now let us analyze the consequences of the rather strong\nconjecture that the planar approximation (19) also vanishes at all orders n > 2.\nIn general, when it is non-vanishing, a planar approximation provides us with infor-\nmation in two distinct limits, namely in the large-Nc limit and also in the large-NF limit.\nThe intriguing link that it provides between these limits is underwritten by the way the\nlarge-order behaviour of perturbation theory is built by renormalon singularities, as was\nconsidered in QCD in the pioneering work of Ref.[21] and reviewed in detail in Ref.[22].\nThis leads one to expect that the asymptotic behaviour of terms in perturbation theory\nin nth order is of the form Cn \u223c K\u03b2\nn\n0n\n\u03b4n! (where \u03b20 is the first coefficient of the QCD\n\u03b2-function) and so it is natural to develop perturbative coefficients as an expansion in\n5\npowers of \u03b20. The planar approximation is indeed polynomial in \u03b20 and hence can be\nrewritten as\nC(\u2113)N=1n |planar = CF\nn\u22121\u2211\ni=0\nC\u02dc\n(\u2113)N=1\nn,i \u03b2\nn\u22121\u2212i\n0 N\ni\nc , (20)\nwhere again the C\u02dc\n(\u2113)N=1\nn,i are pure numbers. This expansion is closely related to the proce-\ndure of naive nonabelianization (NNA) or large-\u03b20 approximation proposed in Refs.[23, 24]\nin which one replaces NF by (11Nc \u2212 3\u03b20)\/2 (for recent applications see Refs.[25, 26]).\nThe expansion of Eq. (20) in Nc\/\u03b20 can be regarded as involving different numbers of\neffective renormalon bubble chains involving powers of \u03b20 [22], inserted in planar dia-\ngrams [20]. There is a related expansion in NF\/\u03b20 which is obtained by replacing Nc by\n(3\u03b20 + 2NF )\/11 [27, 24]\nC(\u2113)N=1n |planar = CF\nn\u22121\u2211\ni=0\nC\u02c6\n(\u2113)N=1\nn,i \u03b2\nn\u22121\u2212i\n0 N\ni\nF , (21)\nand here again the C\u02c6\n(\u2113)N=1\nn,i are pure numbers. This expansion, which has been termed\nthe \u201cdual NNA\u201d, has no direct Feynman diagrammatic interpretation, but turns out to be\nrather useful in making estimates of perturbative corrections to various physical quantities\n(see for example Ref.[25]).\nWe now consider how the planar approximation is related to renormalon singularities.\nFollowing the work of Parisi [28] one expects that there will be singularities in the Borel\ntransforms of QCD observables. We stress that we are focusing here on a coefficient\nfunction, say C, and ignoring any anomalous dimension part, since the latter will not\ncontain renormalon effects [29]. C will have a Borel representation\nC(a) =\n\u222b\n\u221e\n0\ndz e\u2212z\/aB[C](z) . (22)\nHere a \u2261 \u03b1s\/\u03c0 and B[C](z) is the Borel transform. The work of Parisi implies that one\nexpects branch point singularities in z along the real axis at positions z = \u00b1zn where\nzn \u2261 4n\/\u03b20, n = 1, 2, 3, 4, . . .. Those on the positive real axis are referred to as infrared\nrenormalons (IRn), and those on the negative real axis as ultraviolet renormalons (UVn).\nNear each of these singularities one expects the structure\nB[C](z) =\n\u2211\ni\nKi +O(1\u00b1z\/zn)\n(1\u00b1z\/zn)\n\u03b4i\n, (23)\nwhere the sum is over the contributions of various operators, and the \u03b4i exponents depend\non their anomalous dimensions. The large-order asymptotic behaviour of the perturbation\ntheory will be determined by the dominant renormalon singularity nearest the origin, and\nits corresponding operator with largest \u03b4i. The analysis has been carried out for the Adler\ne+e\u2212-annihilation function, and for moments of the DIS structure functions F1, F2 and F3,\nin Ref.[30]. UV1 gives the dominant contribution for the Adler e\n+e\u2212-annihilation function,\nand contributes, together with IR1, to the moments of DIS structure functions. The same\ndimension-six operator gives the dominant contribution to UV1 in all the cases considered.\n6\nIn the planar approximation one finds the exponent [20]\n\u03b4+ = 2\u2212\n\u03b21\n\u03b220\n+\n2NF\n3\u03b20\n+\n\u221a\n16NF\n2\/9 + 9N2c\n2\u03b20\n\u2212\n3Nc\n2\u03b20\n, (24)\nand one obtains the asymptotic large-order behaviour for the coefficient function of the\nNth non-singlet moment of F2\nCNn \u2248 KN\n(\n\u2212\u03b20\n4\n)n\nn\u03b4+\u22121n! . (25)\nIn the large-Nc limit one finds the asymptotic behaviour,\nCNn \u2248 KN\n(\n\u221211\n12\n)n\nNnc n\n19\/121n! . (26)\nOnly the overall constant KN depends on the moment taken; the remaining n-dependence\nis universal [30]. Notice that in fact the same n-dependence also applies to the moments\nof F1 and F3 [30].\nOur present conjecture is that the non-singlet moments of F2 in charged-lepton DIS\nand in neutrino DIS have essentially the same planar approximation, as a consequence\nof some generalization of the Cutkosky rules that were investigated to two-loop order in\nRef.[16]. One obvious consequence is that K1 = 0 for the Gottfried sum rule, since clearly\nthere are no corrections to the Adler sum rule. For higher moments the KN (N > 1) will\nbe nonzero, but very simply related. At n = 2 loops, one sees from Eqs. (11) and (13) that\nboth the \u2113 and \u03bd non-singlet F2 moments are dominated by C\n(2),(+)(x, 1), at large Nc. If it\nremains true beyond two-loop order that only the (+) component receives a contribution\nfrom planar diagrams, then one would expect that 6C(\u03bd)Nn |planar = C\n(\u2113)N\nn |planar with the\nfactor of 6 simply resulting from the normalization of the Adler and Gottfried sums rules\nin the most naive quark-parton model. Not only would we expect 6C(\u03bd)Nn \u2212 C\n(\u2113)N\nn to be\nsuppressed by a factor of 1\/N2c , but also to decrease rapidly with the moment number, N ,\nas is the case at two-loop order.\nSo far we have considered only the leading UV renormalon contribution. One may\nanticipate that there is an equally important IR1 contribution, but to compute the corre-\nsponding \u03b4 one would need the anomalous dimensions of twist-four operators contributing\nto the operator product expansion (OPE) for the non-singlet moments of F2, which are\nnot known explicitly. The expectation would, however, be that the corresponding constant\nKIRN would vanish for N = 1, and for N > 1 should differ by a factor of 6 for the \u03bd and \u2113\nDIS moments.\nSince the leading 1\/Q2 OPE corrections to the moments of DIS structure functions\nare connected with the leading IR1 renormalon (for a review, see Ref.[22]), we thus ex-\npect higher-twist contributions to the Gottfried sum rule to be suppressed by a factor of\n\u03b1s\/(\u03c0Nc) \u223c 1\/(N\n2\nc log(Q\n2\/\u039b2)) as Nc \u2192\u221e, relative to comparable effects in the Bjorken\nsum rules [31, 26], because in the Gottfried sum rule a renormalon chain starts to develop\nonly in a non-planar three-loop diagram, while in the case of the Bjorken sum rules it\nstarts to develop in a two-loop planar diagram.\n7\n3 The nucleon sea at large Nc\nThe previous discussion leads us to believe that the naive quark-parton model expression\nfor the Gottfried sum rule, namely IG =\n1\n3\n, is not modified by perturbative effects, or by\ntheir resummations as renormalon chains generating higher-twist effects, in the large-Nc\nlimit. But in the real world, at Nc = 3, the experimental data of the NMC collaboration\n(see Eq. (4)) show a very significant discrepancy from the naive expectation of 1\n3\n.\nThere are several ways out of this puzzle. One is to say that 1\/N2c = 1\/9 is not small\nenough for our considerations to be relevant. Another is to say that the 1\/N2c suppression\nto two-loop order was an accident that will not be repeated at higher loops. To our\nminds, the most interesting response is to allow that 1\/9 may be a small enough factor\nto take seriously, and that such a suppression of radiative corrections may persist beyond\ntwo loops and hence be reflected in a suppression of higher-twist corrections, associated\nwith IR renormalons. Then that leaves the failure of the naive Gottfried sum rule to be\nexplained by an intrinsically non-perturbative flavour asymmetry of the nucleon sea that\nis inaccessible to renormalon analysis but should still be apparent in the Nc \u2192 \u221e limit,\nto which we have appealed in our perturbative conjectures and their resummations.\nIt was interesting to learn from the authors of Ref.[32] that this is indeed the distinctive\nfeature of a chiral-soliton model based on the work of Ref.[33]. Briefly, their large-Nc\npicture, at a very low normalization point, around 0.6 GeV, is as follows. Isosinglet\nunpolarized distribution functions are large, since they give rise to sum rules that are\nproportional to Nc; isovector unpolarized distribution functions appear only at next-to-\nleading order in 1\/Nc, with the Adler sum rule satisfied in the form\n1\n2\nIA = 1 =\n\u222b 1\n\u22121\ndx (u(x)\u2212 d(x)) (27)\nwhere the integrand at x > 0 corresponds to a \u201cconstituent\u201d quark contribution and at\nx < 0 to an antiquark contribution coming from u(x)\u2212 d(x) = \u2212\n(\nu(\u2212x)\u2212 d(\u2212x)\n)\n. The\nfailure of the Gottfried sum rule at large Nc is attributed to the integral\n1\n2\n(3IG \u2212 1) = \u2212\n\u222b 0\n\u22121\ndx (u(x)\u2212 d(x)) =\n\u222b 1\n0\ndx\n(\nu(x)\u2212 d(x)\n)\n= O(N0c ) (28)\nwhich measures the flavour asymmetry of the nucleon sea at this very low normalization\npoint. Values of IG between 0.219 and 0.178 were obtained for a range of constituent\nquark masses between 350 and 420 MeV, in fair agreement with IexpG = 0.235 \u00b1 0.026 at\nQ2 = 4GeV2. Note, however, that the NMC data are at a substantially higher momentum\nscale than can be accessed directly by the chiral-soliton model. For that reason, the authors\nalso compared their predictions for u(x)\u2212 d(x) with the parton distributions of Ref.[34],\nwhich were initialized at a comparably low scale. Here too, they claim fair agreement.\nThere are, of course, several other approaches to the problem of estimating the light-\nquark flavour asymmetry of the nucleon sea, based on meson-cloud models, instanton\nmodels and other considerations (see the reviews of Refs.[8, 9] and the recent work in\nRef.[35]). We have highlighted the results of the chiral-soliton model because it is based\non the large-Nc expansion, used throughout this work.\n8\n4 Conclusions\nWithin the large-Nc expansion we have made the following conjectures, based on rather\nlimited two-loop input:\n1. Within the framework of light-flavour symmetry, the radiative corrections to the Got-\ntfried sum rule are suppressed by a factor 1\/N2c , relative to the typical expectation\nO((Nc\u03b1s\/\u03c0)\nn) \u223c 1\/(log(Q2\/\u039b2))n at n loops. We base this on the facts that they\nvanish at the one-loop level and are merely of order (\u03b1s\/\u03c0)\n2 \u223c 1\/(Nc log(Q\n2\/\u039b2))2\nat n = 2 loops.\n2. We expect the unknown three-loop anomalous-dimension coefficient \u03b3N=12 to be re-\nstricted to only 3 of 6 possible colour structures, namely C2F (CF\u2212CA\/2), CFCA(CF\u2212\nCA\/2) and CF (CF \u2212 CA\/2)NF .\n3. We expect the ratio of the non-singlet moments, with N > 1, for the charged-lepton\u2013\nnucleon and neutrino\u2013nucleon F2 structure functions, to maintain the naive ratio 6:1,\nat large Nc, within the framework of light-quark symmetric perturbative QCD, after\none discounts quark-loop terms involving NFd\nabcdabc\/NC, which will contribute to\nthe neutrino\u2013nucleon moments. We have exposed the behaviour 6C(\u03bd)Nn \/C\n(\u2113)N\nn =\n1 + O(1\/N2c ) for all N > 1 at n = 2 loops and expect it to persist at higher loop\norders in the quenched approximation, NF \u2192 0.\n4. Moreover, even at finite Nc, we expect this ratio to tend to unity at high moment-\nnumber N , as is the case at two loops.\n5. We expect higher-twist corrections, of order 1\/Q2, to follow the same patterns and\nhence to be negligible in the Gottfried sum rule at large Nc.\n6. In attempting to reconcile this large-Nc perturbative picture with the significant\ndiscrepancy between the measured value for the Gottfried sum rule and the naive\nexpectation of 1\n3\n, we note with interest the low-energy picture of the nucleon as a\nchiral soliton in the large-Nc limit, which leads to an intrinsically non-perturbative\nflavour asymmetry of the nucleon sea [32]. We believe that current phenomenological\nanalyses which incorporate a flavour-asymmetric sea as non-perturbative input, as\nfor example in the most recent parton distributions of Refs.[36, 37, 38, 39], capture\nthe essence of this situation, in a manner that cannot be achieved by radiative\ncorrections, or by their resummations in the form of higher-twist effects.\nAcknowledgements We are most grateful to W. van Neerven and to C.
