This aircraft\nwas one of the first widespread implementations of\nfly-by wire and represented at the time of its introduc-\ntion a step change in terms of its inherently unstable\nairframe and computer flight controller. Of particu-\nlar interest in terms of pilot efficiency is the amount\nof pilot effort in terms of corrections which have to\nbe input to the flight controls to achieve trajectory\ntracking.\nThe F16 flight dynamics are non-linear, time vary-\ning, and traditionally flight controllers have been\ndesigned by utilizing linearized aircraft models oper-\nating at a variety of set-point operating conditions [1].\nThese linearized, time-invariant models yield gain-\nscheduled controllers, which do not exhibit globally\nacceptable performance [2]. In order to address these\nproblems, non-linear techniques such as feedback\nlinearization have become a de-facto standard as an\n\u2217Corresponding author: School of Engineering, University of\nLincoln, Brayford Pool, Lincoln LN6 7TS, UK.\nemail: pstewart@lincoln.ac.uk\nalternative to gain scheduling [3]. In this article, an\nexisting feedback linearization scheme is augmented\nby a fuzzy logic controller that has been designed and\noptimized by a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm\n(MOEA) in order to take advantage of the inherently\nstable aspects of the feedback linearized controller,\nmerged with the aggressive flight control aspects of\nthe fuzzy controller.\nGood performance has been reported using a variety\nof techniques, such as robust dynamic inversion [4, 5],\nneural networks [6, 7], Lyapunov functions [8], reced-\ning horizon control [9], and fuzzy logic [8, 10, 11].\nAlthough these approaches give good results, some\neither utilize simplifications or linearizations related\nto the aircraft model, not encompassing the non-\nlinear six-degrees-of-freedom (6DOF) aircraft dyna-\nmics [7]. Recently, non-linear techniques have been\nextended some way to 6DOF dynamics [12], com-\nplex multiple structure design techniques [13] (which\nonly deals with one longitudinal channel), non-linear\nneural network-based control [14], which addresses\nstability in multiple axes and uncertain aircraft\ndynamics.\nFinally, it has been recognized [15] that a holistic\napproach to design incorporating artificial intelli-\ngence (AI) methodologies such as fuzzy logic, com-\nbined with techniques capable of incorporating mul-\ntiple and often conflicting objectives and constraints\nJAERO610 Proc. IMechE Vol. 224 Part G: J. Aerospace Engineering\n294 P Stewart, D Gladwin, M Parr, and J Stewart\nhas the potential to deliver high performance control\nnot only in multiple physical axes but also multi-\ndimensional objective solution spaces.\nIn this article, a comprehensive design approach\nis proposed, based around a non-linear 6DOF F16\nmodel, which is controlled by an existing feedback\nlinearized 6DOF flight controller. The objective is to\ndesign an augmented controller that delivers aggres-\nsive aerobatics when compared with the linearized\ncontroller, while still retaining its associated sta-\nble operation. Although flight control and fighter\nmanoeuvre have previously been considered using\nradial basis function networks and Lyapunov func-\ntions [8, 16], a degree of training and learning is\nrequired to develop both model and controller. In\norder to develop a more generic approach and avoid\nthe need for training, in this article, a fuzzy logic con-\ntroller is developed on a real-time authentic aircraft\nmodel, and is tested by a qualified pilot instructor\nagainst a realistic flight plan.\nThe augmented controller was developed offline in\nSimulink, then integrated into the real-time operating\nsystem of a 6DOF flight simulator in the Faculty of\nEngineering at the University of Sheffield (Fig. 1).\nThe Simulator is an Explorer RD manufactured by\nCueSim Ltd. (www.cuesim.co.uk). The aerodynamic\ndata used in the simulation was derived from NASA\nLangley wind-tunnel tests conducted on a scale model\nof an F-16 fighter [17], and model by Stevens and\nLewis [18].\n2 AIRCRAFT 6DOF EQUATIONS AND MODEL\n2.1 Aircraft equations of motion\nThe 6DOF equations of motion for an aircraft (assum-\ning a flat non-rotating earth) are given by [16]\nu\u02d9 = rv \u2212 qw + q\u00afS\nm\nCx \u2212 g sin \u03b8 + Tm (1)\nFig. 1 University of Sheffield Faculty of Engineering\nFlight Simulator\nv\u02d9 = pw \u2212 ru + q\u00afS\nm\nCy + g sin \u03c6 cos \u03b8 (2)\nw\u02d9 = qu \u2212 pv + q\u00afS\nm\nCz + g cos \u03c6 cos \u03b8 (3)\np\u02d9 = (J1r + J2p)q + J3L + J4N (4)\nq\u02d9 = J5pr \u2212 J6(p2 \u2212 r2)q + J2M (5)\nr\u02d9 = (J8p \u2212 J2r)q + J4L + J9N (6)\n\u03c6\u02d9 = q tan \u03b8 sin \u03c6 + r tan \u03b8 cos \u03c6 (7)\n\u03b8\u02d9 = q cos \u03c6 \u2212 r sin \u03c6 (8)\n\u03c8\u02d9 = r cos \u03c6 sec \u03b8 + q sin \u03c6 sec \u03b8 (9)\nP\u02d9N = u cos \u03b8 cos \u03c8 + v(\u2212cos \u03c6 sin \u03c8\n+ sin \u03c6 sin \u03b8 cos \u03c8) + w(sin \u03c6 sin \u03c8\n+ cos \u03c6 sin \u03b8 cos \u03c8) (10)\np\u02d9E = u cos \u03b8 sin \u03c8 + v(cos \u03c6 cos \u03c8\n+ sin \u03c6 sin \u03b8 sin \u03c8) + w(\u2212sin \u03c6 cos \u03c8\n+ cos \u03c6 sin \u03b8 sin \u03c8) (11)\nh\u02d9 = u sin \u03b8 \u2212 v sin \u03c6 cos \u03b8 \u2212 w cos \u03c6 sin \u03b8 (12)\nwhere (u, v,w) are the velocities in the (XB,YB,ZB) body\naxes, \u03c6 is the roll angle, \u03b8 is the pitch angle, \u03c8 is the yaw\nangle, p is the roll rate, q is the pitch rate, r is the yaw\nrate, pN is the north position, pE is the east position,\nand h is the altitude.

The states describing the rigid body motion of\nan aircraft with respect to a flat earth are\nX T = [V , \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03c6, \u03b8 , \u03c8 ,p,q, r,pN,pE,h] (31)\nwhere V is the total aircraft velocity, \u03b1 is the angle of\nattack, \u03b2 is the sideslip angle, \u03c6 is the pitch angle, \u03c8\nis the yaw angle, p is the roll rate, q is the pitch rate, r\nis the yaw rate, pN is the north position, pE is the east\nposition, and h is the altitude.

The engine module contains thrust\ninformation as a function of throttle setting, Mach\nnumber and altitude. The effect of fuel burn is mod-\nelled to allow a more realistic mission simulation.\nThe aerodynamic data are derived from F-16\nscale model wind-tunnel tests [17]. The body-axis\naerodynamic coefficients are held in multi-dimen-\nsional look-up tables with associated linear interpo-\nlation algorithms. The data covers an angle of attack\nrange from \u221220\u25e6 to 90\u25e6, and a range of sideslip angles\nfrom \u221230\u25e6 to 30\u25e6. The deflection limit of the elevator is\n\u00b125\u25e6, the ailerons is \u00b121.5\u25e6, and the rudder is \u00b130\u25e6.\n2.3 Inner control loop\nA standard inner-loop stabilizing controller had pre-\nviously been designed and integrated into the F-16\nsimulator [4], which modifies the plant dynamics\nunder varying flight conditions using the dynamic\ninversion method.\nThe controlled variables for pitch, roll, and yaw are\ndenoted as Mcv, Lcv, and Ncv respectively. The con-\ntrolled variable for the longitudinal dynamics is a\ncombination of pitch rate and angle of attack\nMcv = q + 0.1\u03b1 (33)\nand the variables for the roll and yaw moments L and\nN are\nLcv = p\nNcv = r\n(34)\nThe generalized controls are thus\nM\u02d9cv(cmd) = q\u02d9cmd + 0.1\u03b1\u02d9cmd\nL\u02d9cv(cmd) = p\u02d9cmd\nN\u02d9cv(cmd) = r\u02d9cmd\n(35)\nThe open loop plant to be inverted is\nM\u02d9cv = [M\u03b1 + 0.1Z\u03b1 Mq + 0.1Zq][\u03b1 q]T + M\u02d9cv(cmd)\n(36)\n[\nL\u02d9cv\nN\u02d9cv\n]\n=\n[\nL\u03b2 Lp Lr\nN\u03b2 Np Nr\n]\u23a1\u23a3\u03b2p\nr\n\u23a4\n\u23a6+\n[\n1 0\n0 1\n] [\nL\u02d9cv(cmd)\nN\u02d9cv(cmd)\n]\n(37)\nFor dynamic inversion, the state equation is manipu-\nlated to solve for the control thus\ny\u02d9d = h(x) + g(x)u\ng(x)u = y\u02d9d \u2212 h(x)\nu = g(x)\u22121(y\u02d9d \u2212 h(x))\n(38)\nJAERO610 Proc.

This management controller would assess the\npilot\u2019s demands and apply rules to create an output\nthat utilizes the full potential of the F-16\u2019s \u2018relaxed\nstatic stability\u2019 [20]. The final output would be \u2018de-\nfuzzified\u2019 by a real-time updated output membership\nset calculated from the flight performance variables\nto give optimum flight surface deployment values for\nthat instance. The fuzzy logic controller was designed\nthrough a process of five steps:\n(a) input and control variables definition;\n(b) condition interface definition;\n(c) rule-base design;\n(d) computational unit design;\n(e) de-fuzzification design.\n3.1 Input, control variables and condition\ninterface\nThe input variables were selected as the pilot pitch,\nroll, and yaw rate commands as well as the corre-\nsponding demand rate-of change. The control vari-\nables were the aileron, elevator, and rudder output\ndemands to the physical control section of the F-16\nmodel. The condition interface is the method in\nwhich observations of the processes are expressed as\nmembers of the fuzzy linguistic sets.\nThe pitch, roll, and yaw membership sets were con-\nstructed in an identical manner, although the range\nthe membership sets covered was altered according\nto the relative range of the input signals. Repre-\nsentative function plots for variable \u2018roll\u2019 are shown\nin Figs 2 to 4. Gaussian type membership function\nshapes have been chosen due to their smooth, non-\nlinear differentiable functions, which are thought to\nFig. 2 Roll rate command function\nProc.

In particular, the objectives for\nthe new flight controller were defined as follows.\n1. The aircraft should have acceptable flying quali-\nties as defined using the Cooper\u2013Harper pilot rating\nscale [23].\n2. The quality of the controller must be an improve-\nment on the original controller.\n3. The aircraft should respond precisely to small abso-\nlute stick movements.\n4. The aircraft should respond rapidly to large rate of\nchange stick demands.\n5. Low phase lag between cockpit controller and flight\ncontrol surface.\n6. The controller must not allow the aircraft to become\nunstable.\n7. The controller must not allow the aircraft to exceed\nits safe characteristics (i.e. Max G).\nA number of these objectives can be considered to be\nsubjective and therefore a trained pilot was used in\nconsultation to help decide, in the final assessment of\nthe controller, whether they had been met. The rule\nbase uses the linguistic sets defined by the inputs to\ndetermine the optimum output. The design of the rule\nbase consists of determining which rule should be\napplied under which circumstance. To help decide in\nthis matter a controller specification was developed.\nThe rule base was designed to operate to produce\noutput results in the manner shown in Fig. 5.\nThe relational surface for the motion controllers is\nshown in Fig. 6.\nJAERO610 Proc. IMechE Vol. 224 Part G: J. Aerospace Engineering\n298 P Stewart, D Gladwin, M Parr, and J Stewart\nFig. 5 Rule base\nFig. 6 Relational surface\n3.3 De-fuzzification\nThe computational unit utilized Mamdani-type fuzzy\nprocessing [5]. The computational unit uses the centre\nof area (COG) method to \u2018de-fuzzify\u2019 the results and\nprovide a scale factor applied to the raw pilot input\ndemands and the original controller action to give the\ndesired action. The COG method has both continu-\nity and un-ambiguity, which were considered more\ndesirable than the simpler computational complex-\nity of the mean of maxima method. The scale factor\nproduced by the fuzzy logic flight management con-\ntroller ranged between one and zero. An output of zero\nwas considered very stable and equivalent to the origi-\nnal controller. An output of one was considered very\nunstable and equivalent to there being no flight con-\ntroller present at all; this was simulated by passing the\npilot inputs directly through as surface demands to the\nphysical model.\nThe testing on the explorer RD demonstrated the\npossibility of G-forces being placed on the aircraft\nwhich exceeded the maximum the plane structure\ncould accommodate. The specification specifically did\nnot allow this and for this reason management of\nthe G-forces experienced was included in the new\nflight controller. If the aircraft started to approach the\nmaximum or minimum G-forces allowed, the flight\ncontroller would demand the aircraft to respond in\na completely stable manner to prevent any structural\ndamage to the aircraft. The controller was tested by\ninputting small (10 per cent of full demand) and large\n(95 per cent of full demand) disturbances at low (Mach\n0.25) and high (Mach 1.75) speeds to the system with\nand without the new flight management controller\nand analysing the results.\nThe results demonstrated that while the aircraft\nmanoeuvrability may have been increased, its perfor-\nmance in tracking pilot demands was poor and in most\ncases poorer than the original F-16 flight controller;\nshowing evidence of high overshoot and large settling\ntimes.\nIn response to the rather poor performance of the\ncontroller, there are a number of options to be consid-\nered, a notable example of which is the Takagi\u2013Sugeno\nmodelling approach, which has been demonstrated\nwith excellent results in the control of non-linear sys-\ntems [24\u201326]. However, to improve the performance\nof the controller it was decided to use genetic algo-\nrithms (GAs) to tune the fuzzy controller [27], which\nhas a number of advantages. GAs are ideally suited to\ntune controllers for multi-input multi-output (MIMO)\nsystems, and in particular, the multi-objective genetic\nalgorithm (MOGA) has been shown to deal effectively\nwith multi-variable, competitive and complex objec-\ntive functions that have robust characteristics [28]. As\nthe problem under consideration here is MIMO, has a\ncompetitive, multiple objectives, and will ideally have\nsome aspects of robustness in performance, the choice\nof MOGA as a tuning tool for the fuzzy logic controller\nwas confirmed.\nGAs are a stochastic global search and optimiza-\ntion method that mimic natural biological evolution\nthrough the principles of natural selection, genetic\nmodification and selective breeding. GAs operate on\na population of individuals with each individual rep-\nresenting a possible solution to the optimization\nproblem.\nGAs begin with the random initiation of a popu-\nlation. With each generation of a GA, a new set of\napproximations is created by a process of selection,\ncrossover and mutation. The selection process deter-\nmines the fittest individuals to go on to the next\npopulation. Crossover exchanges the genetic material\nof two of individuals, creating two new individuals.\nMutation changes, at random, the genetic material of\nan individual. This process leads to the evolution of\na population that is better suited to its environment\nthan the individuals from which it was created, just as\nwith natural adaptation.\nThe solution is usually achieved when a certain\nnumber of generations have been reached. GAs are\napplicable to non-linear optimization problems that\nmake them ideal for optimally tuning the fuzzy logic\nflight management controller.\nProc. IMechE Vol. 224 Part G: J. Aerospace Engineering JAERO610\nMulti-objective evolutionary\u2013fuzzy augmented flight control for an F16 aircraft 299\nThe GA was written in Matlab incorporating the\nMOGA toolbox [29, 30] and integrating the full F-16\nsystem model including the new fuzzy logic flight\nmanagement controller [28]. The fuzzy logic con-\ntrollers for pitch, roll, and yaw were each optimized\nindividually using MOGA techniques. It was decided\nto optimize the membership sets of each controller to\nattempt to improve the overall system performance.\nThe initial population of individuals was selected at\nrandom but within boundaries stipulated by the pilot\ndemands. The population was limited to a hundred\nindividuals to allow for a large spread of values but not\nincrease the processing time significantly. The vari-\nables were defined as the parameters of each class in\nthe membership sets. Each class required two param-\neters to define its Gaussian shape; a location point for\nthe peak value and a width. With 17 classes contained\nin the three membership sets (theG-Forcemembership\nsetwasnot optimizedas thiswas considered safety criti-\ncal) thus the MOGA optimized 34 variables. This phase\nof the algorithm applies the individuals to the objec-\ntive functions and measures how well they complete\nthe task. The level to which the individual successfully\ncompleted the task is known as its fitness.\n3.4 MOGA overview\nFormally, and without loss of generality [31], multi-\nobjective optimization can be expressed as\nMinimize f (x)\nwhere f (x) = (f1(x), . . . , fn(x)) is a vector of objective\nfunctions, n is the number of objectives or criteria to\nbe considered, x = (x1, . . . , xp) is a vector of decision\nvariables, and p is the number of decision variables\nthat comprise the complete solution. In the absence\nof preference information, solutions to multiobjective\nproblems are compared using the notion of Pareto\ndominance. A particular solution x, with associated\nperformance vector u, is said to dominate, another\nsolution y with performance vector v(x,p, y) if the\nformer performs at least as well as the latter across\nall objectives, and exhibits superior performance in\nat least one objective. A solution is said to be Pareto\noptimal if it is not dominated by any other possi-\nble solution. The Pareto-front is the set of points in\ncriterion-space that correspond to the Pareto-optimal\nsolutions. Without a priori or progressive preference\narticulation, a multi-objective search engine will gen-\nerally aim to discover a family of solutions that provide\na good representation of the Pareto front (Figs 7 and 8).\nThe first Pareto-based MOEA to be published\nwas the MOGA [29]. GAs are suitable search engines\nfor multi-objective problems primarily because of\ntheir population-based approach. An MOEA is capa-\nble of supporting diverse, simultaneous, solutions\nin the search environment. A carefully designed GA\nFig. 7 Non-dominated solution\nFig. 8 Pareto optimality\nis robust in the face of ill-behaved cost landscapes\nfeaturing attributes such as multi-modality and dis-\ncontinuity. Furthermore, the GA methodology offers\na flexible choice of decision variables and objective\nJAERO610 Proc. IMechE Vol. 224 Part G: J. Aerospace Engineering\n300 P Stewart, D Gladwin, M Parr, and J Stewart\nFig. 9 MOGA schematic\nspecifications. A general schematic of the MOGA is\nshown in Fig. 9. The MOGA framework can be seen\nto incorporate all the elements of the standard, sin-\ngle objective, GA. A population of potential solutions\nis instantiated, then assessed and manipulated over a\nnumber of iterations in order to obtain a good solution\nor set of solutions. Performance assessment, selection,\ngenetic operators (such as crossover and mutation),\nand reinsertion phases are functionally, in a general\nsense, the same for the MOGA as for the standard GA.\nPopulation distribution analysis, in which a measure\nof the density of the population is made, has also been\napplied in the single objective case to cater for multi-\nmodal cost landscapes. The results of this analysis are\nused in niching and mating restriction schemes.\nMulti-objective ranking, which impacts primarily on\nfitness assignment, is the key difference between the\nMOGA and a standard GA. Interaction with a decision-\nmaker (DM), or group of DMs, is made explicit in Fig. 9.\nThe DM may choose to introduce a priori information\ninto the initial population (at the very least, this would\ninclude appropriate limits on decision variables), as\nis sometimes the case in standard GA applications.\nWith the MOGA, the DM can also seek to influence\nthe search while it is in progress by expressing pref-\nerence for particular solutions or, more generally, the\nlikely attributes of a good solution.\nThe essential difference between an MOGA and a\nsingle objective GA is the method by which fitness is\nassigned to potential solutions. Each solution will have\na vector describing its performance across the set of\ncriteria. This vector must be transformed into a scalar\nfitness value for the purposes of the GA. This process\nis achieved by ranking the population of solutions rel-\native to each other, and then assigning fitness based\non rank. Individual solutions are compared in terms\nof Pareto dominance. This notion was introduced into\nthe field of GAs by Goldberg [32]. MOGA uses a varia-\ntion of Goldberg\u2019s proposition in order to determine\nranks. Each individual is assigned a rank based on\nthe number of individuals by which it is dominated\n(Fig. 10).\nIn the absence of preference information, Pareto\ndominance is used to discriminate between two\nFig. 10 Multi-objective ranking\nProc. IMechE Vol. 224 Part G: J. Aerospace Engineering JAERO610\nMulti-objective evolutionary\u2013fuzzy augmented flight control for an F16 aircraft 301\ncompeting solutions. However, by involving a DM in\nthe search, other factors can be used to determine\nsuperiority. Fonseca and Fleming [30] introduced a\npreferability operator, which discriminates between\nsolutions on the basis of which is preferred by the\nDM. In Fonseca and Fleming\u2019s scheme, the DM can\nset goal levels and priorities for each of the objec-\ntives. These can be refined as the search progresses.\nThis information feeds into the preferability operator,\nwhich is used to rank solutions in a similar fashion\nto the standard Pareto-based approach. Each poten-\ntial solution is given a rank based on how many other\nsolutions are preferred to it. The preferability oper-\nator can be seen as a unification of several popular\npreference articulation schemes adopted in the wider\noperational research community. Pareto optimality,\nthe lexicographic method, goal programming, con-\nstraint satisfaction, and constrained optimization can\nall be described by special cases of the preferability\noperator.\nThe individuals were assigned a fitness based upon\nthe following four objective functions:\n(a) overshoot;\n(b) rise-time;\n(c) target constraint;\n(d) iterative time area error (ITAE).\nThe target constraint was a check to ensure that the\ncontroller constructed using the individual\u2019s pheno-\ntypes (variables) was possible of a response equal to\nthat of the demand. ITAE [33] is a method of analysing\nthe error between the demand signal and the con-\ntrollers. The integration of time means this objective\nfunction especially penalizes large settling times as\nwell as large deviations from the demanded signal.\nAssigning the fitness required ranking the values based\non how well they minimized the objective functions.\nThese functions returned a column vector contain-\ning the relevant individual fitness values ranked upon\nthe goals and priorities declared in the MOGA\u2019s ini-\ntialization. The goals and priorities were arranged and\nranked as follows:\nPriorities\n(a) manufacturer\u2019s maximum g specification for the\nairframe (9g for the F16);\n(b) feasibility of the solution.\nGoals\n(a) overshoot;\n(b) rise-time;\n(c) ITAE;\n(d) magnitude of stick movement;\n(e) bandwidth of stick movement.\nThe consequence of assigning priorities is to set hard\nconstraints in the solution space of the search, in order\nonly to return controllers which are physically possible\nto implement safely on the airframe. The goals were\nassigned equal significance in the objective function.\nThe nature of Pareto multi-objective optimization is\nto deliver a \u2018family\u2019 of non-dominated solutions. The\nassignment of relative merit to the individual compo-\nnents of the objective function can lead to a more\nhomogeneous solution set, but may exclude valid\nsolutions. Hence equal significance was adopted [30].\nThe simulation was run using a modified form of\nthe F-16 Simulink model including the new fuzzy\nlogic flight management controller. The model was\nmodified to record all the required data for objec-\ntive function analysis and to input step commands\nof varying magnitude. The pitch, roll, and yaw axis\nwere each tested independently using small, medium,\nand large pilot rate demands. The initialization files of\nthe model were modified to place the aircraft level at\n25,000 ft and airspeed of 500 knots. The F-16 autopilot\nfunctions were appropriately used to hold the aircraft\nin this position except in the axis being tested. The\nmodel was run in response to varying step inputs as\ndiscussed for a simulation time of 25 s. The individuals\nin the MOGA were to be used as fuzzy logic controllers\nin the Simulink model. This portion of the GA chose\nwhich values from the population were to be used in\nthe crossover phase. This was achieved based upon the\nfitness of an individual and the population as a whole.\nThere are a number of different methods to accom-\nplish this; however, stochastic universal sampling was\nselected for this GA.\nIndividuals are selected based upon their fitness.\nThe better suited they are to the task, the higher the\nprobability they are to be selected for cross over to\nproduce the next generation.\nA generation gap of 80 per cent was used to per cent\nof the population to continue through to the next gen-\neration with no modification. This allows preservation\nof optimum values from the previous generation to\nensure that the new generation\u2019s performance does\nnot deteriorate when compared with the previous\ngeneration. The MOGA created was used to produce\noptimum controllers for pitch, roll, and yaw responses\nto small, medium, and large pilot rate inputs. The\nresults were used to develop optimum pitch, roll, and\nyaw controllers for all pilot rate demands.\nThe response surfaces produced by the various\nfuzzy logic flight management controllers were ana-\nlysed at their significant areas when considering the\npilot demand. This analysis allowed the correct shape\nof surface required for an optimum controller to be\ndetermined and these are shown in Figs 11 to 13.\nThe analysis of the surfaces produced raised some\ninteresting results. Most notably that the optimization\ndid not recommend a highly unstable response to large\npilot demands. The MOGA results did not recommend\nthat the system ever experience instability greater than\n60 per cent of the maximum available to prevent large\novershoot of the required rate demand. Also the results\nJAERO610 Proc. IMechE Vol. 224 Part G: J.

How-\never, this was against the initial specification and it\nwas ensured that the final surfaces did not include this\nattribute.\nThese developed surfaces were tested using step\ninputs with the results shown in Figs 14 to 16.\nThese results demonstrate that the new optimum\nfuzzy logic flight management controllers represent\nan improvement not only on their initial design but\nProc.

This involved the creation of a\nnew MOGA to utilize individuals that would construct\nnew rules instead of membership classes. This and the\ndevelopment of a new routine to convert the rules into\na suitable format for forming a fuzzy logic controller\nwithin Simulink were successfully achieved.\nThe final results of this analysis returned the origi-\nnal constructed rule-base even when starting from a\nset of random rules. Though this goes a small way\nto verifying that the original rule-base does represent\nan expert system, the results can also be explained\nby remembering that the membership functions were\noptimized to the original rule-base in the previously\nconstructed MOGA. This would make it highly likely\nthat when attempting to optimize a rule-base to these\nmembership functions that the originally constructed\nrule-base would be returned.\n5 TEST FLIGHT\nIn the designing of this improved flight controller, it\nhas always been known that the aim was to improve\naircraft manoeuvrability. This could be considered to\nbe tested by assessing the following two points.\n1. Tracking of pilot rate demands and actual rates\nachieved for all control surfaces while performing\nset manoeuvres.\n2. Total pilot effort required to perform these set\nmanoeuvres.\nThe designed test flight was constructed as follows.\n1. Take-off and turn to a heading of due north while\nmaintaining a 10\u25e6 climb.\n2. Increase climb to 45\u25e6 until a height if 10 000 ft is\nachieved.\n3. Level off aircraft and accelerate to Mach 1.5.\n4. Perform two barrel rolls.\n5. Reduce speed to Mach 0.75 and turn to a heading\nof due south.\n6. Intercept automated drone for one rotation of the\nairfield.\n7. Depart from interception on heading of 220\u25e6 or 40\u25e6\n(NB. Runway in Cranfield Airfield Model runs from\n40\u25e6 to 220\u25e6).\n8. Climb to 1000 ft.\n9. Return to airfield and land safely.\nThis test flight procedure was performed for analysis\nonly after suitable familiarization with the procedure\nhad been achieved to prevent any influence from pilot\nskill affecting the results taken. The flight plan itself\nis constructed in a best effort to excite the important\nmodes of operation of the system to aid analysis of per-\nformance. In particular, to analyse tracking of pilot rate\ndemands, barrel roll, drone interception and intercep-\ntion departure are performed. The other trajectories\nwhich link the aerobatic manoeuvres are designed to\nassess pilot effort and tracking in a less dynamic envi-\nronment. It was felt by the authors that this flight\nplan represents a good vehicle for assessment of the\ncontroller performance.\nThe pilot rate demands and aircraft responses were\nrecorded through use of an inbuilt function of the real-\ntime vehicle flight software. This allowed analysis of\nrecorded real-time flight data with a pilot in the con-\ntrol loop; as apposed to the analysis of data produced\nthrough set inputs into a model.\n6 FLIGHT CONTROLLER TRACKING\nThe relative tracking ability of each system was ass-\nessed through the calculation of the integral absolute\nProc. IMechE Vol. 224 Part G: J. Aerospace Engineering JAERO610\nMulti-objective evolutionary\u2013fuzzy augmented flight control for an F16 aircraft 305\nerror between pilot rate demands and aircraft rate\nresponses. The rate demand used for this analysis can\nbe seen for the original controller in Fig. 17 and the\naugmented controller in Fig. 18.\nAnalysing by ITAE, the new controller has a ratio of\n0.3842, a reduction of 61.58 per cent.\nThe mental effort required to fly an aeroplane, while\nmeeting its mission objectives, are usually referred to\nas pilot compensation. If an aeroplane reacts either\ntoo slow or too fast to a pilot command, the pilot must\ncompensate for the behaviour by \u2018adjusting his own\ngain\u2019 or \u2018leading\u2019 the airplane. Clearly a pilot should\nFig. 17 Test flight performance of the original controller (roll, pitch, and yaw demands)\nFig. 18 Test flight performance of the fuzzy logic flight management controller (roll, pitch, and\nyaw demands)\nJAERO610 Proc.

The sum of the differential will provide\nan indication of the scale of commands made on the\nsystem; an indication of whether the pilot is forced\nto make large corrections due to over\/under steer\nor many small corrections to keep the aircraft cor-\nrectly trimmed. In which case the ratio of the new\ncontroller to old controller is 0.6215, an improve-\nment of 37.85 per cent. An analysis of the differen-\ntial of the pilot inputs to both systems to carry out\nthe same test flight shows a 23.5 per cent reduc-\ntion in the new controller when compared with the\noriginal F-16 flight controller. This would appear to\nsuggest that the new controller required smaller cor-\nrections by the pilot to maintain the desired heading\n(Fig. 19).\n7.1 Cooper\u2013Harper rating scale\nThis is a set of criteria used by test pilots and flight test\nengineers to evaluate the handling qualities of aircraft\nduring flight tests. The Cooper\u2013Harper scale ranges\nfrom 1 to 10, with 1 indicating the best handling char-\nacteristics for an aircraft, and 10 the worst (Fig. 20).\nThe criteria are evaluative and thus the scale is consid-\nered subjective. Therefore a rating is only valid when\nthe aircraft is evaluated by an expert.\nThe F-16 flight controller was evaluated by a quali-\nfied pilot instructor. Although this individual was not\nfamiliar with the aircraft they were an expert in flying\na number of aircraft types and their opinion was con-\nsidered to be authoritative. The pilot rated the aircraft\nwith the new fuzzy logic flight management controller\nas having the highest Cooper\u2013Harper rating of 1.\n8 CONCLUSION\nA multi-objective design of a fuzzy logic augmented\nflight controller has been implemented and its perfor-\nmance analysed. In the initial sector of development,\na standard fuzzy controller was designed, to aug-\nment the standard flight controller. The objective of\nthis development was to increase the aircraft\u2019s aero-\nbatic ability, reduce pilot fatigue, while still retaining\nthe stability inherent in the core flight controller.\nThe resulting augmented controller was found to be\nunsatisfactory in these aspects.\nIn order to improve the performance of the fuzzy\nlogic controller, membership function tuning was car-\nried out by MOGA. This methodology was selected\ndue to MOGAs inherent capability to identify non-\ndominated solutions to highly complex objective\nfunctions, and also the capacity to run robustness\nmeasures as part of the optimization process.\nThe controller tuned by MOGA was designed to\nproduce a MIMO roll, pitch and yaw controller with\nenhanced manoeuverability, while still retaining safety\ncritical operation when combined with a standard\ninner-loop stabilizing controller.\nThe results demonstrated that the new fuzzy logic\nflight management controllers represent an improve-\nment not only on the original uncompensated system\nbut also on the original fuzzy logic design in response\nto pilot rate demands.\nA separate study was performed with MOGA to\ninvestigate if it were possible to improve on the perfor-\nmance of the original fuzzy logic controller\u2019s rule-base.\nThe final results of this analysis returned a rule-base\nidentical to the original, confirming the validity of the\noriginal expert system.\nSubsequent to the design process, the controller\nwas incorporated into a 6DOF motion base real-time\nflight simulator and flight tested by a qualified pilot\ninstructor. The controller was assessed in terms of\npilot effort and reduction of pilot fatigue. The rela-\ntive tracking ability of the controller was assessed and\nfound to have an improvement of 61.58 per cent over\nthe original flight controller without fuzzy augmen-\ntation. The pilot effort was found to be improved by\n37.85 per cent due to smaller corrections necessary to\nmaintain a desired heading or manoeuvre. The pilot\ninstructor considered the handling characteristics of\nthe aircraft to correspond to the highest level on the\nCooper\u2013Harper handling qualities scale.\nIn terms of the multi-objective design, the hard\npriority constraint of a maximum 9g loading on the\nairframe was not found possible to exceed, irres-\npective of aerobatic manoeuvres, and the effective-\nness of the tracking and pilot effort ratios reflect\nthe level of attainment of the objective function\ngoals.\nIt has been shown that by the combination of\na multi-objective optimization approach combined\nwith fuzzy logic controller, the standard flight con-\ntroller of an aircraft can be augmented to provide\nhigher levels of manoeuverability, while retaining core\nstability, remaining within the airframe\u2019s safety lim-\nits, and reducing pilot error while improving tracking\nability. This set of competing objectives present a\nhighly appropriate problem for the application of\nmulti-objective optimization, and have led to the\ndevelopment of an extremely useful novel design\nmethodology.\n\u00a9 Authors 2010\nJAERO610 Proc.
