This paper is \n18 \n19 concerned with the question of how and to what extent those who are subject to \n20 \n21 such regimes are able to resist them. We seek to identify the various forms in 22 \n23 \n24 which resistance to such regimes of power have been manifest in empirical \n25 \n26 studies of health and illness.  Our aims are threefold.

Work of this kind drew attention to how \n21 \n22 \n23 health   status,   and   the   means   for   achieving   good   health,   has   become   a \n24 \n25 predominant  concern  in  modern  society  (Petersen  and  Lupton,  1996).  Of \n26 \n27 particular interest within what has been termed the \u2018New Public Health\u2019 (Green, 28 \n29 \n30 2004)   is   a   well-documented   shift   towards   \u2018promoting\u2019   good   health   and \n31 \n32 encouraging populations to monitor their own health. \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 Peterson and Lupton (1996) have argued that this modern incarnation of public \n38 \n39 health  can  be  conceptualised  as  an  example  of  the  regimes  of  power  and \n41 \n42 knowledge  employed  in  the  regulation  and  surveillance  of  individuals  and \n43 \n44 populations. A reliance on apparently voluntary individual action means that, \n45 \n46 \n47 rather than being constraining or regulatory, the power exercised within public \n48 \n49 health discourses works through the production and creation of individuals who \n50 \n51 are capable of some form of autonomy and will therefore regulate themselves \n53 \n54 (Lupton, 1995). Expert knowledge is argued to play an important role within this \n55 \n56 function (Rose, 1996). The professional, scientific view of what causes ill health, 57 \n58 \n59 and therefore what should be done to prevent it, is seen, within much sociology, \n60 \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n5 \n34 \n46 \nHealth: an interdisciplinary journal for the social study of health, Illness and medicine  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 to be privileged over lay explanations. This kind of argument is mobilised within \n6 \n7 sociological critiques which examine how discourses within public health help to \n8 \n9 shape individual identity. These analyses examine the power of knowledge to 10 \n11 \n12 define and govern subjects (Petersen and Lupton, 1996). \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 These examinations of the relevance of Foucauldian analyses of regimes of \n18 \n19 power to public health beg the question of how and to what extent those who are \n20 \n21 subject to such regimes are able to resist them. This paper seeks to identify the 22 \n23 \n24 various forms in which resistance to such regimes of power have been manifest \n25 \n26 in empirical studies of health and illness.  Its aims are threefold. The first is to \n27 \n28 \n29 alert empirical researchers who wish to examine resistance in the context of \n30 \n31 health and health care to the subtle and nuanced ways in which such resistance \n32 \n33 can be manifested both within and outside encounters with health professionals. \n35 \n36 This is achieved through tracing both Foucault\u2019s own evolution of concepts \n37 \n38 around resistance and how these ideas have been mobilised in empirical studies. \n39 \n40 \n41 The second is to demonstrate the complex forms which such resistance takes, \n42 \n43 problematising the simplistic assumptions that adherence to health promotion \n44 \n45 advice necessarily implies the collapse of agency, and that resistance necessarily \n47 \n48 involves the rejection of advice and interventions. The third is to highlight the \n49 \n50 potentially problematic normative qualities that may be assigned to resistance. 51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 The possibility  of resistance \n56 \n57 \n58 Although empirical studies drawing on Foucault\u2019s work recognise the subtle and \n59 \n60 dispersed ways in which power may operate within society, and in particular its      \n5 \n34 \n46 \nHealth: an interdisciplinary journal for the social study of health, Illness and medicine \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 productive rather than merely coercive potential, there nevertheless remains the \n6 \n7 danger  that  individuals  may  be  characterised  as  somehow  ensnared  within \n8 \n9 powerful  discourses  and  have  no  means  for  resistance.  Foucault  himself  has 10 \n11 \n12 argued that this portrayal of passive and powerless individuals was never his \n13 \n14 intention:  \u2018The  idea  that  power  is  a  system  of  domination  that  controls \n15 \n16 \n17 everything  and  leaves  no  room  for  freedom  cannot  be  attributed  to  me\u2019 \n18 \n19 (Foucault, 1984a:442).  His later works explore how individuals have the ability \n20 \n21 to  demonstrate  resistance  to  the  discourses  that  attempt  to  discipline  and 22 \n23 \n24 control them (Foucault, 1984a&b, 1988). He argues that his views on the nature \n25 \n26 of power have always implied the possibility of resistance, because without this \n27 \n28 \n29 possibility there can be no relations of power (Dumm, 1996). In order for power \n30 \n31 relations to come into existence there must be a certain degree of freedom on the \n32 \n33 side of those exercising power and also of those upon whom it is exercised. If \n35 \n36 there were no possibility for resistance then there would be no power relations. \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 Foucault\u2019s later works balance his previous focus on technologies of domination \n42 \n43 with an exploration of what he terms the \u2018technologies of the self\u2019 (Foucault, \n44 \n45 1988). This idea complements Foucault\u2019s earlier work on the ways in which the \n47 \n48 subject is constituted as an object of knowledge with an analysis of the ways in \n49 \n50 which individuals come to understand themselves as subjects (McNay, 1994). It 51 \n52 \n53 is through this concept that a theory of possible resistance is developed. Through \n54 \n55 what  he  terms  \u2018technologies  of  the  self\u2019  Foucault  suggests  a  more  flexible \n56 \n57 \n58 relationship between discourse and the individual, arguing that the process need \n59 \n60 not be one of straightforward imposition, and opening up at least the potential        \n5 \n34 \n46 \nHealth: an interdisciplinary journal for the social study of health, Illness and medicine  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 for resistance. Foucault argues that possibilities for resistance are located at the \n6 \n7 level of individuals\u2019 daily lives. He suggests a more flexible relationship between \n8 \n9 the dominant discourse and the individual, and emphasises the formation of a 10 \n11 \n12 relationship with the self and the methods and techniques used to bring this \n13 \n14 about. \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 In  his  studies  of  Ancient  Greek  and  Roman  morality,  Foucault  perceives  a \n20 \n21 difference  between  these  classical  moral  systems  and  those  of  the  Christian 22 \n23 \n24 tradition (Foucault, 1984a&b). An important distinction between morality and \n25 \n26 ethics is identified. Morality is seen as a set of imposed rules and prohibitions, \n27 \n28 \n29 ethics  as  the  actual  behaviour  of  individuals  in  relation  to  the  advocated \n30 \n31 morality. Foucault is therefore able to argue that the possibilities for resistance \n32 \n33 are located at the level of ethical behaviour, that is, at the level of individuals\u2019 \n35 \n36 daily  lives.  The  dominant  discourse  with  which  an  individual  is  presented \n37 \n38 (likened to morality) need not be perfectly reflected in the individual\u2019s subject \n39 \n40 \n41 position (likened to ethics). The individual\u2019s thoughts, accounts or actions may \n42 \n43 differ  from  those  advocated  by  the  discourse.  Foucault  is  therefore  able  to \n44 \n45 introduce the possibility of autonomous action on the part of the individual. The \n47 \n48 individual can now be seen as having the opportunity to influence the way in \n49 \n50 which their subjectivity is constructed. A more flexible relationship between the 51 \n52 \n53 dominant discourse and the individual is suggested and emphasis is placed on \n54 \n55 the formation of a relationship with the self and on the methods and techniques \n56 \n57 \n58 used to  work out this relationship  (McNay, 1994).  Burchell (1996) therefore \n59 \n60 argues  the  introduction  of  technologies  or  techniques  of  the  self  implies  a        \n5 \n46 \nHealth: an interdisciplinary journal for the social study of health, Illness and medicine \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 loosening of the connection between subjectification and subjection. A greater \n6 \n7 element of freedom is allowed within individual behaviour in relation to the \n8 \n9 normal  rules  of  conduct  within  a  society.  Individuals  have  the  potential  to 10 \n11 \n12 interpret the norms of behaviour in their own ways rather than simply conform \n13 \n14 to them exactly. \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 Foucault can therefore argue that the process through which large-scale cultural \n20 \n21 patterns  come  to  be  demonstrated  at  the  individual  level  is  not  one  of 22 \n23 \n24 straightforward imposition, cultural patterns need not be perfectly reflected in \n25 \n26 individual  behaviour.  Individuals  may  engage  in  \u2018practices  of  the  self\u2019  and \n27 \n28 \n29 therefore have the potential for some display of resistance. However, neither is \n30 \n31 the individual free to act in any way they wish, \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \u2026I would  say  that  if  I  am  now  interested  in  how  the  subject \n37 \n38 constitutes itself in an active fashion through practices of the self, \n39 \n40 \n41 these practices are nevertheless not something invented by the \n42 \n43 individual  himself  (sic).  They  are  models  that  he  finds  in  his \n44 \n45 culture and that are proposed, suggested, imposed upon him by \n47 \n48 his culture, his society and his social group. \n49 \n50 (Foucault, 1984c:441-2) 51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 The  relationship  is  not  uni-directional  in  terms  of  society  merely  producing \n56 \n57 \n58 docile bodies, but equally, neither can it be seen as a voluntarist process of self- \n59 \n60 construction.  Instead  the  process  represents  a  point  of  contact  at  which        \n5 \n34 \n46 \nHealth: an interdisciplinary journal for the social study of health, Illness and medicine  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 techniques  of  domination  and  techniques  of  the  self  interact  to  produce \n6 \n7 individual   subject   positions   (Burchell,   1996).   The   process   is   complex   as \n8 \n9 particular  discourses  suggest  more  than  one  subject  position  because,  while 10 \n11 \n12 there exists a preferred form of subjectivity, its very existence implies others and \n13 \n14 the possibility for reversal (Weedon, 1987).  In order to be effective, discourses \n15 \n16 \n17 need to be activated through the agency of individuals and this works best when \n18 \n19 the subject position assumed within a particular discourse is identified by the \n20 \n21 individual as compatible with their interests. Where this is not the case then the 22 \n23 \n24 space for resistance is opened up. As Weedon argues, \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 Where there is a space between the position of subject offered by a \n30 \n31 discourse   and   individual   interest,   a   resistance   to   that   subject \n32 \n33 position is produced\u2026The discursive constitution of subjects, both \n35 \n36 compliant and resistant,  is part of a wider social play for power. \n37 \n38 (Weedon, 1987:112-3) \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 This later work suggests not only that the possibility of resistance exists but that \n44 \n45 such resistance may well take complex and flexible forms which extend well \n47 \n48 beyond the outright rejection of dominant discourses.  Feminist scholarship is a \n49 \n50 useful reference here as it has long had as one of its key concerns the thorny 51 \n52 \n53 issue of how to reconcile the idea that women can construct their own lives with \n54 \n55 that which holds that they nevertheless do so within constraining conditions. \n56 \n57 \n58 Developing Foucault\u2019s conceptualization of power as no longer centralized and \n59 \n60 repressive, resistance is regarded as not reducible to a single locus, and rather        \n5 \n34 \n46 \nHealth: an interdisciplinary journal for the social study of health, Illness and medicine \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 attention is focused on how women can be \u2018negotiating at the margins of power\u2019 \n6 \n7 (Davis and Fisher, 1993:6). Focusing analysis at the level at which individual \n8 \n9 women interact with powerful discourses allows an exploration of how these 10 \n11 \n12 discourses are internalized, transformed or resisted, and it becomes clear that \n13 \n14 women can develop different, and potentially opposing, meanings and conduct \n15 \n16 \n17 on the margins of dominant discourses which allow them to \u2018mediate between \n18 \n19 social orders and to invent new forms of knowledge\u2019 (Kielmann, 1998:138). \n20 \n21 Riessman (2000) develops the concept of \u2018transformative effects\u2019 to identify 22 \n23 \n24 women\u2019s thoughts, talk or actions as resistance. Such resistance involves women \n25 \n26 pressing their own claims in relation to others\u2019 and therefore takes the form of \n27 \n28 \n29 thoughts and actions in everyday life that, although not necessarily directly \n30 \n31 confrontational, nevertheless have the potential to engage with, negotiate and \n32 \n33 redeploy or transform powerful discourses and bring about a rearrangement of \n35 \n36 power relations. \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 A number of writers have argued that empirical researchers have not fully \n42 \n43 integrated these more nuanced and subtle conceptualisations of resistance into \n44 \n45 their analyses and, hence, have failed to explore fully the relationship between \n47 \n48 power and resistance (see for example Grimshaw, 1993; Ramazanoglu, 1993; \n49 \n50 Ransom, 1993).  In this paper, we examine this claim in relation to a number of 51 \n52 \n53 exemplars in the field of health and illness which, we believe, demonstrate how \n54 \n55 empirical researchers have indeed achieved a sophisticated understanding of \n56 \n57 \n58 resistance which reflects this later work by Foucault.  We believe that, taken \n59 \n60 together, these authors point the way forwards for those who seek to develop        \n5 \n46 \nHealth: an interdisciplinary journal for the social study of health, Illness and medicine  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 empirical studies which do justice to the complexities which characterise \n6 \n7 Foucault\u2019s writings on resistance. \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 Empirical examples of resistance \n13 \n14 We turn now to an exploration of some examples of resistance identified within \n15 \n16 \n17 empirical studies in order to provide empirical elaboration of Foucault\u2019s later \n18 \n19 work on resistance and how these ideas have been developed in a number of \n20 \n21 studies. We examine case studies from within health and illness studies that 22 \n23 \n24 represent a range of contexts and demonstrate the diversity of forms that \n25 \n26 resistance may take. A critical examination of the kinds of resistance \n27 \n28 \n29 demonstrated in each study permits a subtle, complex and nuanced exploration \n30 \n31 of the ways in which resistance may be demonstrated and explored empirically. \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 Rejection = resistance  \/ acceptance = domination? \n37 \n38 Perhaps the most obvious form of resistance occurs when a patient refuses to \n39 \n40 \n41 cooperate with a medical procedure which has been recommended by his or her \n42 \n43 doctor.  However, as work by Markens et al (1999) shows, it is simplistic to \n44 \n45 assume that rejection of such a procedure is evidence of resistance to \n47 \n48 biomedicine per se or, indeed, that accepting such a procedure constitutes \n49 \n50 domination or submission.  On first impression, refusing an offer of prenatal 51 \n52 \n53 testing may appear a fairly overt form of resistance, interpreted as an individual \n54 \n55 rejecting a biomedical offering. However, a refusal of this kind may actually \n56 \n57 \n58 demonstrate something much more nuanced and subtle. Markens et al. (1999) \n59 \n60 argue most of the research in the area of prenatal testing, and maternal alpha-        \n5 \n34 \n46 \nHealth: an interdisciplinary journal for the social study of health, Illness and medicine \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 fetoprotein (AFP) in particular, has assumed that those who decline such tests \n6 \n7 are simply resisting medicalisation and\/or are opposed to abortion. Markens et \n8 \n9 al. explore how such refusals of AFP are framed, conceptualised and thought 10 \n11 \n12 about. Importantly, they find that both those who accept and those who refuse \n13 \n14 pre-natal testing frame their decisions in terms of the concept of \u2018risk\u2019 as it is \n15 \n16 \n17 constructed in the public health discourse. As such they can be seen as \n18 \n19 embracing rather than resisting the medicalised discourse.  Within many public \n20 \n21 health discourses, from cancer screening to vaccination, the minimisation of risk 22 \n23 \n24 is frequently constructed as one of the hallmarks of a rational and responsible \n25 \n26 individual. However, while the minimisation of risk is central in many women\u2019s \n27 \n28 \n29 accounts, the source of risk is differently understood in each of the two groups. \n30 \n31 Markens et al. argue that, for acceptors, risk is associated with the absence of \n32 \n33 prenatal information, whereas for refusers it is the information generated by \n35 \n36 such tests that poses the risk. Therefore, mothers can deploy the concept of risk \n37 \n38 to defend their decision, whether that decision is to accept or reject AFP, but this \n39 \n40 \n41 should not necessarily be interpreted as a form of resistance to biomedicine \n42 \n43 more generally. Thus, it is important to distinguish between resistance at the \n44 \n45 behavioural level (e.g. refusal to accept a particular recommended procedure) \n47 \n48 and resistance at the conceptual level (e.g. rejection of the discourse within \n49 \n50 which a particular procedure is embedded). 51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 Conversely it may be tempting to regard instances in which individuals have \n56 \n57 \n58 accepted a medical offering as resistance-free. However, as Potts, Grace, Gavey \n59 \n60 and Vares (2004) demonstrate, whilst the intervention may be accepted, the way       \n5 \n34 \n46 \nHealth: an interdisciplinary journal for the social study of health, Illness and medicine  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 in which the problem is framed or understood may be strongly resisted. In their \n6 \n7 research on Viagra users, the individual men\u2019s accounts do not necessarily \n8 \n9 endorse biomedical constructions of their sexual difficulties. Potts et al. argue 10 \n11 \n12 that the medical model of erectile dysfunction employs a mechanistic view of the \n13 \n14 body and treats such dysfunction as a pathology to be treated.  However, some \n15 \n16 \n17 users of Viagra challenge this medical presentation and view dysfunction as a \n18 \n19 natural part of the ageing process. They are therefore critical of the \n20 \n21 \u2018pathologization\u2019 of their problems as representing some form of medical 22 \n23 \n24 condition. In an interesting approach, Potts et al. juxtapose extracts from drug \n25 \n26 company pamphlets that are targeted directly at consumers with the accounts of \n27 \n28 \n29 users themselves. They contrast the pamphlet\u2019s framing of \u2018erection problems\u2019 as \n30 \n31 a medical matter that a visit to the doctor would resolve with participants\u2019 \n32 \n33 discussions of how these were simply one part of a whole range of bodily \n35 \n36 changes associated with ageing. Potts et al. conclude by arguing that the medical \n37 \n38 model of male sexuality assumes the universal application of the \u2018sexual \n39 \n40 \n41 response cycle\u2019 and therefore a commonality of experience. However, the diverse \n42 \n43 range of understandings and experiences highlighted by their research \n44 \n45 demonstrates the lack of empirical support for this and draws attention to the \n47 \n48 resistance of users to framing their experience in these terms and their \n49 \n50 employment of a variety of alternative meanings and significances. The 51 \n52 \n53 resistance comes through the men\u2019s reluctance to think about or perceive their \n54 \n55 experiences in medical, or medically \u2018correct\u2019, terms. Instead, they put forward \n56 \n57 \n58 their own conceptualisations that demonstrate the heterogeneity of experience. \n59 \n60 While these differences in approach led some men to stop taking Viagra, many       \n5 \n34 \n46 \nHealth: an interdisciplinary journal for the social study of health, Illness and medicine \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 continued to use this medical solution to their problems while maintaining \n6 \n7 alternative, non-medical conceptualisations of those same problems.  Once again \n8 \n9 we see that conceptual resistance to and behavioural rejection of biomedical 10 \n11 \n12 offerings do not necessarily map neatly onto one another. \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 Kaufert\u2019s study (Kaufert 1998) demonstrates a further possible manifestation of \n18 \n19 resistance. In her research on women with breast cancer she focuses particularly \n20 \n21 on cases where the medical solution or treatment is accepted, but the ways in 22 \n23 \n24 which it is delivered, and healthcare consultations organised and managed, are \n25 \n26 resisted. Kaufert therefore explores the various forms of resistance developed \n27 \n28 \n29 from within the healthcare or treatment system. She argues that women with \n30 \n31 breast  cancer  put  together  an  oppositional  discourse  which  challenges  the \n32 \n33 domination of medicine by reinterpreting what it means to be a woman with \n35 \n36 breast cancer and resists stereotypes of how such women should behave. While \n37 \n38 such   resistance   was   initially   manifested   at  the   micro   level   of   individual \n39 \n40 \n41 encounters  with  health  professionals,  \u2018resistance  subsequently  turned  into  a \n42 \n43 demand  for  the  reformulation  of  the  relationship  between  women  and  the \n44 \n45 medical and scientific research establishment\u2019 (Kaufert, 1998:288). \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 These  examples  demonstrate  the  range  of  ways  in  which  resistance  can  be 51 \n52 \n53 manifest and indicate the importance of researchers looking beyond whether \n54 \n55 individuals  do  or  do  not  accept  behavioural  advice. They  underline  the \n56 \n57 \n58 importance of also exploring how issues or conditions are conceptualised and \n59 \n60 understood. As the work by Potts et al demonstrates, resistance can be located at        \n5 \n34 \n46 \nHealth: an interdisciplinary journal for the social study of health, Illness and medicine  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 the level of understanding and conceptualisation of an issue or problem, and this \n6 \n7 need not necessarily be translated into a refusal of the (in this case medical) \n8 \n9 intervention. As such an important distinction can be made between the exercise 10 \n11 \n12 of resistance at the behavioural or conceptual level, and empirical work should \n13 \n14 be  equally  alert  to  both  possible  manifestations  and  the  potential  interplay \n15 \n16 \n17 between them. Kaufert\u2019s ( 1998) work is an excellent example of this in that it \n18 \n19 recognises  how  many  women  with  breast  cancer  are  unlikely  to  choose  to \n20 \n21 display  behavioural  level  resistance  by  refusing  treatment,  thereby removing 22 \n23 \n24 themselves from the cancer care system, yet still remains alert to the resistance \n25 \n26 demonstrated through reconceptualisations of how breast cancer care should be \n27 \n28 \n29 accomplished. As   Kaufert   explores,   this   conceptual   resistance   may   be \n30 \n31 subsequently translated into behavioural resistance, but this takes the form of \n32 \n33 social movements seeking to remodel breast cancer care, rather than declining of \n35 \n36 treatment at the individual level. \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 Resisting expertise and authoritative knowledge \n42 \n43 In the first two of the three studies discussed above (those on prenatal testing \n44 \n45 and Viagra use) the wider socio-cultural context within which patients choose to \n47 \n48 accept or reject particular biomedical offerings is characterised by some \n49 \n50 ambivalence.  For example, there is extensive ethical debate about the legitimacy 51 \n52 \n53 of prenatal testing which is linked to the assumption that a positive result will \n54 \n55 lead to the possibility of abortion.  Hence, in the case of prenatal testing, the \n56 \n57 \n58 moral censure that may be associated with the rejection of a perceived health \n59 \n60 preserving technology such as cervical cancer screening (Howson, 1999) is       \n5 \n34 \n46 \nHealth: an interdisciplinary journal for the social study of health, Illness and medicine \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 mitigated.  Similarly, ambiguity about whether erectile dysfunction is best \n6 \n7 interpreted as a recreational or a medical problem means that such dysfunction \n8 \n9 is unlikely to be regarded in the same way as declining medical treatment for 10 \n11 \n12 something like breast cancer. \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 In contrast, many of the instances in which sociologists have applied Foucauldian \n18 \n19 ideas of governmentality to public health and health promotion deal with \n20 \n21 examples in which, it is argued, powerful discourses are very much at work both 22 \n23 \n24 in constructing a morally acceptable, responsible and desirable outcome (for \n25 \n26 example, to attend for screening or make dietary changes) and also in directing \n27 \n28 \n29 the way in which the intervention should be framed and understood. While this \n30 \n31 does not mean that resistance becomes impossible, it can mean that the ways in \n32 \n33 which this is demonstrated change. \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 In their work on the production of authoritative knowledge in prenatal care, \n39 \n40 \n41 Browner and Press (1996) show how pregnant woman do not uncritically accept \n42 \n43 biomedical messages about how they should change their health-related \n44 \n45 behaviours during pregnancy even though such changes are strongly encouraged \n47 \n48 and the \u2018failure\u2019 to make such changes is likely to be subject to moral sanction. \n49 \n50 They cite the example of \u201cKitty\u201d, who was reluctant to give up smoking during 51 \n52 \n53 pregnancy, despite being encouraged to do so. By explaining that she smoked \n54 \n55 during her first pregnancy and had a nine-pound baby who scored a 9 on the \n56 \n57 \n58 APGAR (a system of scoring a baby\u2019s condition one minute after birth, on which \n59 \n60 the maximum score is 10), Kitty undermines and ultimately rejects the       \n5 \n34 \n46 \nHealth: an interdisciplinary journal for the social study of health, Illness and medicine  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 biomedical claim that smoking during pregnancy harms the unborn child as it \n6 \n7 does not conform to her previous experience. Generally speaking, the women in \n8 \n9 Browner and Press\u2019 study accepted those recommendations that were confirmed 10 \n11 \n12 by their own personal experience, whilst rejecting those that ran counter to pre- \n13 \n14 existing beliefs about how to care for themselves during pregnancy or those that \n15 \n16 \n17 could not be easily incorporated into their everyday lives. Resistance in this \n18 \n19 example comes through the selective incorporation of biomedical \n20 \n21 recommendations, in which those that do not fit with existing experiences or 22 \n23 \n24 beliefs are resisted. \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 The potential for resisting the construction of certain behaviour as morally \n30 \n31 acceptable and others as morally reprehensible is further demonstrated in \n32 \n33 Murphy\u2019s examination of mothers\u2019 responses to professional advice about \n35 \n36 breastfeeding.  (Murphy 2003).  Murphy suggests that women are subject to \n37 \n38 powerful medical discourses that clearly set out the \u2018correct\u2019 behaviour, in this \n39 \n40 \n41 case breast feeding for the first sixteen weeks, but all the women interviewed \n42 \n43 had broken at least some of the expert-defined rules. Murphy demonstrates how \n44 \n45 mothers engaged with and resisted this normalising discourse of medicalised \n47 \n48 scientific expertise and offered counter discourses through which their own \n49 \n50 feeding practices were legitimised. These counter discourses can therefore be 51 \n52 \n53 understood as a \u2018rhetorical strategy of resistance\u2019 (Murphy, 2003:443), and are \n54 \n55 comparable to the concept of \u2018transformative work\u2019 advanced by Reissman \n56 \n57 \n58 (2000). Rose (1996) argues that expertise plays a central role in modern forms \n59 \n60 of government and it is interesting to explore the ways in which mothers in        \n5 \n34 \n46 \nHealth: an interdisciplinary journal for the social study of health, Illness and medicine \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 Murphy\u2019s research engaged with ideas of expertise and employed them \n6 \n7 rhetorically in their strategies of resistance. Many criticised professional, \n8 \n9 scientific expertise on infant feeding on the grounds that it was not sufficiently 10 \n11 \n12 adaptable to particular circumstances and individual babies. Through this, \n13 \n14 women who \u2018broke the rules\u2019 could legitimise their behaviour through appeals to \n15 \n16 \n17 their own expertise in relation to their particular baby. \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 Women in Murphy\u2019s study therefore did not reject the notion of expertise; 22 \n23 \n24 instead they incorporated this very concept into their production of counter \n25 \n26 discourses that relied upon their status as holders of a different kind of expertise. \n27 \n28 \n29 Whilst Browner and Press (1996) demonstrate a selective rejection of antenatal \n30 \n31 biomedical recommendations by pregnant women, Murphy\u2019s research suggests a \n32 \n33 more comprehensive resistance to professional claims of expertise over the \n35 \n36 whole area of infant feeding. To a degree, Murphy\u2019s work echoes that of Browner \n37 \n38 and Press in that women draw upon, and give preference to, their individual \n39 \n40 \n41 knowledge and experience. However, the resistance demonstrated in Murphy\u2019s \n42 \n43 research goes further than a process of selective incorporation or resistance in \n44 \n45 that women have constructed and employed a coherent and sustained counter \n47 \n48 discourse. This may reflect the different degrees of success of biomedical \n49 \n50 discourses in establishing dominance over the prenatal and postnatal care of 51 \n52 \n53 healthy infants. \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 The range of different ways in which people can resist through mounting \n59 \n60 challenges to biomedical and\/or scientific expertise is further illustrated by       \n5 \n34 \n46 \nHealth: an interdisciplinary journal for the social study of health, Illness and medicine  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 Rogers and Pilgrim\u2019s (1995) work on opposition to the mass childhood \n6 \n7 immunisation (MCI) programme. They argue that the resistance they identify in \n8 \n9 this specific context, which included lay people developing dissenting views on 10 \n11 \n12 disease aetiology and different assessments of risk, is representative of a wider \n13 \n14 phenomenon of challenging scientific expertise. Parents choosing not to \n15 \n16 \n17 vaccinate their children drew on what they saw as legitimate reasons to resist \n18 \n19 the official doctrine that children should be included in immunisation \n20 \n21 programmes and to justify their decision. It is interesting to note that the 22 \n23 \n24 position adopted by these parents with regard to immunisation was not \n25 \n26 necessarily representative of a wider conflict with biomedicine and health \n27 \n28 \n29 promotion messages in other contexts. Instead, these parents were often heavily \n30 \n31 involved in reducing risks to their child\u2019s health by following the \n32 \n33 recommendations of public health discourses in many other ways, including \n35 \n36 prolonged breastfeeding, promoting healthy eating and a focus on physical and \n37 \n38 mental well-being. Therefore, while this demonstration of resistance to medical \n39 \n40 \n41 authority in the context of MCI represents a breaking down of traditional \n42 \n43 patterns of authority and deference between lay people and medical \n44 \n45 professionals, it is not a full-scale rejection of biomedicine. \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 In contrast, the final example for consideration, although still concerned with a 51 \n52 \n53 specific context, represents a wider rejection of biomedicine and demonstrates a \n54 \n55 refusal to adopt biomedical ways of thinking. Gold and Ridge (2001) interviewed \n56 \n57 \n58 HIV-infected gay men who had decided not to access antiretroviral drug therapy. \n59 \n60 Reasons for not accessing treatment were varied but mainly drew upon the       \n5 \n34 \n46 \nHealth: an interdisciplinary journal for the social study of health, Illness and medicine \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 experiences of friends who had used the drugs as only a minority had any \n6 \n7 personal experience on which to base their decisions. Many felt the medical \n8 \n9 discourse trivialised the potential side effects of the drugs, for example, and 10 \n11 \n12 employed their friends\u2019 experiences to challenge this. In this way the resistance \n13 \n14 here differs slightly from that based on personal experiential knowledge, as seen \n15 \n16 \n17 in Browner and Press\u2019 (1996) work. \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 A particularly interesting element of Gold and Ridge\u2019s work is their description of 22 \n23 \n24 how the men themselves thought of their behaviour as designed to resist \n25 \n26 pressure to access therapy (from both doctors and indeed from the gay \n27 \n28 \n29 community) which they believed to be unreasonable.  A certain pride was felt by \n30 \n31 the men in their ability to resist this pressure. Gold and Ridge argue that these \n32 \n33 men were in conflict with the biomedical model for the management of HIV\/AIDS \n35 \n36 and that their decisions not to access therapy should indeed be seen as examples \n37 \n38 of dissent. These men had a fundamentally different way of thinking from the \n39 \n40 \n41 biomedical model \u2013 one which values individual experience over medical \n42 \n43 concepts. In this way, the values of abstraction, detachment and objectivity \n44 \n45 which are embraced by medical science, and underpin its claims to authority, are \n47 \n48 rejected in favour of knowledge drawn from the experience of those close to the \n49 \n50 individual. Therefore, not only do men reject the drug treatment offered by 51 \n52 \n53 biomedicine, they also reject the underpinning approach and perspective on \n54 \n55 which it is based. \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 Discussion       \n5 \n34 \n46 \nHealth: an interdisciplinary journal for the social study of health, Illness and medicine  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 In the course of this paper, we have drawn on a range of empirical work to \n6 \n7 demonstrate how resistance has been conceptualised and studied, and to explore \n8 \n9 its   manifestations  as  localised,   diverse  and  diffuse  \u2013  in  accordance  with 10 \n11 \n12 Foucault\u2019s conceptualisation of power relations. We do not believe it is helpful, or \n13 \n14 indeed  perhaps  even  possible,  to  offer  a  definitive  definition  of  resistance. \n15 \n16 \n17 Rather, what is crucial is to recognise its heterogeneity and context specificity. \n18 \n19 The empirical evidence suggests that the forms such resistance may take are \n20 \n21 many and varied, and it is important to take account of contextual influences 22 \n23 \n24 when thinking about the potential for resistance in different circumstances and \n25 \n26 how this may manifest itself. \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 Rather  than  a  firm  definition,  it  is  fruitful  to  conceptualise  the  relationship \n32 \n33 between power and resistance as a complex network with multiple points of \n35 \n36 potential  difference  or  divergence  bringing  possibilities  for  disruption  to  the \n37 \n38 discursive flow.  Within this, slight variations in interpretation or understanding \n39 \n40 \n41 can potentially lead to a diverse range of outcomes because resisting is not a \n42 \n43 homogenous process. Rather than a one-dimensional conceptualisation, we need \n44 \n45 to conceive of this process in terms of a web of potential points of resistance \n47 \n48 which may ultimately result in individuals adopting very different stances or \n49 \n50 positions.  Our  critical  examination  of  a  range  of  recent  empirical  studies  of 51 \n52 \n53 resistance  within  health  and  illness  studies  has  illustrated  this  point  and \n54 \n55 emphasised  how  refusal  of  a  biomedical  offering  should  not  necessarily  be \n56 \n57 \n58 construed  as  resistance,  while  adopting  a  medically  recommended  treatment \n59 \n60 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5 \n34 \n46 \nHealth: an interdisciplinary journal for the social study of health, Illness and medicine \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 need not represent full acceptance of the medical construction of a particular \n6 \n7 condition or problem. \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 This  tension  is  apparent  in  the  dichotomy  of  attendance  or  non-attendance \n13 \n14 which is frequently used within health services research to measure the success \n15 \n16 \n17 of health interventions such as screening programmes or immunisation. While it \n18 \n19 is clearly important to have accurate information on the uptake or coverage of \n20 \n21 such services, we should also bear in mind that attendance, or what we might 22 \n23 \n24 more  generally  term  cooperation,  does  not  necessarily  imply  a  wholesale \n25 \n26 endorsement  either  of  the  biomedical  construction  of  a  condition  or  the \n27 \n28 \n29 intervention  offered;  just  as  non-attendance  does  not  necessarily  involve  a \n30 \n31 whole-sale  rejection.  On  that  basis  health  services  should  not  assume  that \n32 \n33 cooperation implies full acceptance, just as non-cooperation does not necessarily \n35 \n36 equal  resistance.  A  focus  on  the  behavioural  level  in  no  way  adequately \n37 \n38 represents the diverse range of positions or stances that individuals may adopt, \n39 \n40 \n41 and so is therefore misleading. For example, Potts et al. (2004) showed how, \n42 \n43 while many men were resistant to the problem of erectile dysfunction being \n44 \n45 medicalized, they nevertheless took advantage of the medical treatment offered. \n47 \n48 Similarly, it is conceivable that the currently relatively high rates of coverage in \n49 \n50 public health initiatives such as the cervical screening programme could quickly 51 \n52 \n53 be undermined, as the recent case of the MMR vaccination demonstrated. \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 Attempts to define what resistance might mean, and to apply such definitions or \n59 \n60 conceptualisations to particular practices within the context of empirical work        \n5 \n46 \nHealth: an interdisciplinary journal for the social study of health, Illness and medicine  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 can, as we have seen, be complex. Grimshaw (1993) has identified some of the \n6 \n7 difficulties, including on what grounds we can identify something as resistance, \n8 \n9 how we can distinguish between effective and ineffective resistance and how we 10 \n11 \n12 are to determine when a particular behaviour or practice represents the mere \n13 \n14 reproduction  of  conventional  norms  and  when  it  becomes  resistance.  These \n15 \n16 \n17 difficulties are illustrated to some degree in the discussion above. However, an \n18 \n19 important problem neglected in this list of difficulties concerns the normative \n20 \n21 judgements that may, either intentionally or unintentionally, be associated with 22 \n23 \n24 resistance. There are of course dangers inherent in starting out with a fixed and \n25 \n26 arbitrary dichotomy between celebrated, active resistance and passive, negative \n27 \n28 \n29 acceptance or cooperation - not least because such a starting point may well \n30 \n31 over-determine where any subsequent analysis ends up. \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 This is a significant risk that needs to be avoided in exploring empirically the \n37 \n38 relationship between power and resistance, and particularly demonstrations of \n39 \n40 \n41 the latter in the face of the former. The recognition that resistance may well be \n42 \n43 morally-weighted,  whether  positively  or  negatively,  is  important.  One  key \n44 \n45 example of this is the need to avoid \u2018romanticizing resistance\u2019 and recognise the \n47 \n48 issues that may arise from this. In particular, the temptation to \u2018romanticize\u2019 \n49 \n50 women\u2019s resistance and ascribe it a quality that was never intended has been 51 \n52 \n53 recognized (Abu-Lughod, 1990), and Abel and Browner (1998) have suggested \n54 \n55 that much of the emphasis upon women\u2019s resistance is the result of a desire to \n56 \n57 \n58 describe  dominatory  patterns  while  avoiding  portraying  women  as  passive \n59 \n60 victims. This recognition of a desire on the part of some to restore agency to        \n5 \n34 \n46 \nHealth: an interdisciplinary journal for the social study of health, Illness and medicine \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 apparently  oppressed  individuals  or  groups  is  important  as  it  taps  into  the \n6 \n7 implicit  normative  judgements  involved  in  regarding  resistance  to  power  as \n8 \n9 inherently  positive and  the  associated  risk of  celebrating  individuals\u2019  actions 10 \n11 \n12 without a critical examination of their consequences. \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 Celebrating resistance without adequate attention to the context and possible \n18 \n19 consequences is a very real danger, and this issue has been highlighted within \n20 \n21 the context of health and illness by Timmermans and Haas (2008) who argue 22 \n23 \n24 that sociologists have largely failed to engage with the normative functions of \n25 \n26 health interventions, i.e. the prevention of ill-health, the curing of disease and so \n27 \n28 \n29 on. They trace this failing back to the decline of functionalism and the rise of a \n30 \n31 critical social constructivism, which they suggest \u2018replaced the shared norms of \n32 \n33 science with the one norm of organised scepticism towards medical authorities\u2019 \n35 \n36 (2008:670). They do not suggest that the sociologist\u2019s role is to legitimise the \n37 \n38 authority of health professionals, rather they argue that \u2018a critical appraisal of \n39 \n40 \n41 these powers is necessary but such an analysis should take the overall health \n42 \n43 purpose of interventions into consideration\u2019 (2008:671). Similarly, Prior (2003) \n44 \n45 has argued that, whilst individuals can have extensive knowledge of their own \n47 \n48 health and illness experiences, and may develop and advance sophisticated \n49 \n50 theories on the basis of these,  there are nevertheless limitations to lay thinking. 51 \n52 \n53 On this basis, awareness of wider medical or epidemiological evidence may be \n54 \n55 limited or non-existent (and, as Prior points out, there is no reason why \n56 \n57 \n58 individuals should possess this). This is not necessarily to discount or trivialise \n59 \n60 lay understandings, but simply to restate the need to critically evaluate the wider        \n5 \n34 \n46 \nHealth: an interdisciplinary journal for the social study of health, Illness and medicine  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 context and possible health implications for themselves and others; for example \n6 \n7 a pregnant woman\u2019s refusal to give up smoking on the basis that it did no harm \n8 \n9 in previous pregnancies or parents\u2019 refusals of childhood immunisation. In these 10 \n11 \n12 cases individuals\u2019 resistance to medical expertise may be characterised as being \n13 \n14 based on incomplete or flawed evidence. In conceptualising and exploring \n15 \n16 \n17 resistance to powerful medical and public health discourses, it is important not \n18 \n19 to lose sight of the ultimate goal of treating and preventing disease: the extent to \n20 \n21 which we should applaud resistance to health promotion discourses if the 22 \n23 \n24 subsequent behaviours put individuals or populations at greater risk of harm is a \n25 \n26 moot point. \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 It is thus important not to make uncritical normative judgements on the validity \n32 \n33 or appropriateness of such demonstrations of resistance. It may be tempting to \n35 \n36 applaud individuals for developing strategies of resistance, particularly if one has \n37 \n38 set up in advance an overly-simplistic dichotomy between powerless, oppressed \n39 \n40 \n41 individuals on the one hand and active, resisting individuals on the other. This is \n42 \n43 where a simplistic reading and application of early Foucauldian work might lead \n44 \n45 us. One key question is whether we should simply applaud such resistance as \n47 \n48 evidence that individuals have been able to develop a sustained and coherent \n49 \n50 counter discourse which allows them to escape from biomedical domination and 51 \n52 \n53 account for and defend their actions. Many individuals or groups who are \n54 \n55 engaged in what may be regarded as deviant behaviour (for example organised \n56 \n57 \n58 crime or speeding in their cars) may be able to advance perfectly coherent and \n59 \n60 sustained accounts of why they are acting legitimately on the basis of        \n5 \n34 \nHealth: an interdisciplinary journal for the social study of health, Illness and medicine \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 interpretation, negotiation and framing of key issues and\/or the undermining of \n6 \n7 expert pronouncements in each case. \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 This review of empirical work has shown that individuals may resist in different \n13 \n14 ways, employing different resources and pursuing their resistance to differing \n15 \n16 \n17 degrees  using  a  range  of  strategies.  Just  as  power  is  diffuse  and  dispersed, \n18 \n19 present within all social interactions, so resistance can also be thought of in such \n20 \n21 terms. The conceptualisations of resistance explored in this paper fit well with, 22 \n23 \n24 and build on,  feminist arguments that resistance cannot be reduced to a single \n25 \n26 locus and that attention needs to be focused on how women can be \u2018negotiating \n27 \n28 \n29 at the margins of power\u2019 (Davis and Fisher, 1993:6). However, this does not \n30 \n31 mean  that  such  resistance  is  meaningless  or  is  not  worthy  of  sociological \n32 \n33 attention.  On  the  contrary,  such  resistance,  aside  from  being  intrinsically \n35 \n36 interesting in its own right, is important for the potential and power that it has, \n37 \n38 and for what it can contribute to our understanding of the relationship between \n39 \n40 \n41 power and resistance in everyday life. \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n46 \nHealth: an interdisciplinary journal for the social study of health, Illness and medicine  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 References \n8 \n9 Abel, E.
