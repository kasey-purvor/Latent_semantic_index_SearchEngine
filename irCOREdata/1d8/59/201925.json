Trains were \nfast compared with coaches or walking, and the social saving of time saved grew \nover time to become over 10 percent of national income in 1912. Including fare \nsavings as well, social savings were 14 percent of national income in 1912, with \nconsumer surplus of 6 percent. Time savings dominated fare savings once rail-\nways became a new good: travel for the masses. Using the social savings-total \nfactor productivity identity, we show that railways accounted for around a sixth \nof economy-wide productivity growth in this era. \nne of the defining characteristics of the industrial revolution and its \naftermath was the increasing opportunities for travel. Although \nbetter roads and better carriage design had increased attainable speeds \nbefore the transport revolution, they remained restricted by the physical \nlimitations of the horses that powered them. On water, sailors remained \nat the mercy of the wind.\n1\n The industrial revolution changed both. \nRailways allowed overland travel that was faster than anyone had pre-\nviously believed possible, and steamships meant that coastal and inter-\nnational travel was now not only faster but much more predictable. By \n1871, Britain had over 13,000 miles of railway track, and by 1891 the \naverage person in Britain took the train every other week.\n2\n This, then, \n\u0003The Journal of Economic History, Vol. 66, No. 3 (September 2006). \u00a9 The Economic \nHistory Association.

The social savings controversy has \ndemonstrated the great complexity of the analysis of the developmental impact of railroads, the \nwide range of issues that need to be pursued, the large amounts of data that must be retrieved \nand the many pitfalls that may be encountered in the analysis of these data. Such problems are \nresolved through collective effort\u201d (\u201cNotes,\u201d p. 51). Where this article alters the existing litera-\nture it does so in that spirit of collective effort.

In \nthis article we use modern economic techniques to value the time saved \nby railway passengers in England and Wales between 1843 and 1912. \n Improvements in passenger transport technology can have many ef-\nfects: raising or lowering costs, speeding it up or slowing it down, mak-\ning it more or less comfortable, and leading to more or fewer deaths and \ninjuries. The correct way to analyze transport improvements, ex ante \nand ex post, is via cost-benefit analysis. In recent years governments \nand others have improved the quality of such analyses; in this article we \napply those insights historically.\n3\n Cost-benefit analysis starts from the \npremise that the benefit of passenger transport is getting from one place \nto another, or, more generally, transporting one person one mile. Costs \nconsist of monetary and nonmonetary costs, which, once nonmonetary \ncomponents have been given monetary values, are added together to \nmake \u201cgeneralized costs.\u201d The most important nonmonetary cost is the \nvalue of time, which should vary with the type of person traveling, the \nreason for travel, and the comfort of the mode of transport used, and \nshould include waiting as well as traveling time.\n4\n Economic theory states that an individual\u2019s valuation of time is the \nopportunity cost, that is the value of the alternative use for that time. \nFor those traveling on work time, the value of an hour saved is the \nhourly employment cost, because if travel were instantaneous, an hour \nof travel could be replaced by an hour\u2019s productive work.\n5\n Neo-classical \neconomics holds that workers value leisure time at their take-home \nwage rate. If they value it less, they should work for longer, if they \nvalue it more, they should reduce their working hours. In fact both re-\nvealed-preference and willingness-to-pay studies show that people \nvalue their leisure and commuting time at around half their take-home \nhourly wage.\n6\n That time savings are not included in GDP is not of concern to \neconomists and economic historians. Our interest is in consumer wel-\n3 See, for example, the websites of the Department for Transport\u2019s Transport Analysis Guid-\nance, available at www.webtag.org.uk; and Leeds University\u2019s Institute for Transport Studies, \nwww.its.leeds.ac.uk. \n4 Great Britain, Transport, pp. 196\u201397. \n5 Costs include gross wages, payroll taxes, and employer pension contributions, as well as a \nshare of overhead costs (office space, back office functions, and so on), which add 21.2 percent \ntoday. Where an individual\u2019s wages are unknown, the usual proxy is the average wage for users \nof that transport mode. Department for Transport, \u201cValues,\u201d p. 2, paragraph 1.2.4 and p. 4,  \ntable 1. \n6 The U.K. government currently values leisure and commuting time at 46 percent of average \ntake-home wages. This is for working age people and pensioners, with the latter\u2019s valuation 25 \npercent lower than the former\u2019s. In order to correct for the lower ratio of pensioners to working \nage people in the nineteenth century, we increase the overall figure by 4 percentage points, to 50 \npercent of the take-home wage. Ibid., paragraph 1.2.17. \nTime is Money 637 \nfare gains from new technology, whatever form those gains take. If they \nare valued by consumers then they are part of consumer surplus, if they \nare part of consumer surplus then they should be included in cost-\nbenefit analysis.\n7\n In addition to the transport costs and benefits that ac-\ncrue to users, there may be externalities to those who do not travel at all. \nBetter transport can destroy local monopolies and increase productivity \nthrough agglomeration effects, it can also change the rates at which \nnonusers are killed or injured, and affect levels of local and global pol-\nlution. These additional factors would need to be included in a calcula-\ntion of the full economic effect, but lie outside the scope of this article, \nwhich, in keeping with earlier historical studies, seeks to estimate the \ntransport costs and benefits. \n The form of cost-benefit analysis used by historians to study railways \nis known as \u201csocial savings.\u201d This approach was first used in the 1960s \nin the pioneering works of Robert Fogel and Albert Fishlow.\n8\n Their \nstudies aimed to quantify the value of railways to the United States in \n1890 and 1859, respectively. Put simply, the social saving from rail-\nways is the minimum additional amount that society would have to pay \nto do what the railways did, without them, that is, the cost of moving \nfreight and passengers without trains. Social saving thus measures the \nfall in resources required to provide a given level of output. It is analo-\ngous to total factor productivity growth, because, under competitive \nconditions, TFP growth is equivalent to a fall in the cost of providing \noutput. Thus social savings are a measure of the contribution of techno-\nlogical change to productivity growth. This means that we can divide \nthe social saving estimate by economy-wide total factor productivity \ngrowth to find the contribution of railways to overall total factor pro-\nductivity growth.\n9\n The social saving methodology, as used by Fogel, Fishlow, and Gary \nHawke in their original studies measures the cost to society of doing ex-\nactly what it did with the railways, without them. Elementary econom-\nics tells us that quantity demanded rises as price falls, and thus, because \nprices were lower in the railway era, the social saving will overstate the \nbenefit of railways to society: some people would not have been willing \nto pay the higher price to travel. The extent to which travel increases \ndepends on the (generalized) price elasticity of demand, which is (im-\nplicitly) assumed to be zero in the social saving methodology. Fogel \nsets out the formula to convert the social saving into the increase in \nconsumer surplus, according to different estimates of the elasticity of \n7 Great Britain, Transport, 3.10\u20133.12, pp. 57\u201358. \n8 Fogel, Railroads; and Fishlow, American Railroads.\n9 Foreman-Peck, New Perspectives.\n638 Leunig\ndemand.\n10\n We discuss an appropriate estimate of elasticity later in the \narticle, and convert our estimates of social savings into consumer surplus. \nHISTORIOGRAPHY \n Hawke calculated the social savings from goods and passenger travel \nfor English and Welsh railways from 1840 to 1870, with particular em-\nphasis on 1865. Hawke\u2019s passenger methodology is simple and correct. \nHe finds the distance people traveled in each class and assesses the \nmeans by which they would otherwise have traveled. He then finds the \ntotal cost by each method, with the difference representing the social \nsaving. This is calculated as either 2.1 percent or 5.8 percent of GDP, \ndepending on whether first-class rail is held to be as comfortable as the \ninside of a stage coach, or traveling by private carriage, generally \nknown as a post-chaise.\n11\n Hawke argues that the latter is more represen-\ntative of the facilities and comfort offered by first-class travel in 1865. \n These findings have not gone unchallenged. In his review William \nBaker notes that Hawke\u2019s social saving estimate is roughly double those \nof Fogel and Fishlow, with much of the difference coming from \n\u201cHawke\u2019s attempt to quantify the greater convenience and comfort of \nrail over non-rail passenger service.\u201d\n12\n He adds \u201cHere this reviewer is \nnot convinced.\u201d\n13\n Similarly, Fishlow notes that \u201cthe largest part of the \ncost savings emanate from reduced fares for personal travel (in particu-\nlar first class accommodations).\u201d\n14\n Noting that post chaise costs, at six \ntimes coaching costs, seem exceptionally high, Fishlow recalibrates \nHawke\u2019s social savings figures with an arbitrary lower cost of posting, \nand finds that social savings fall by one half. This leads him to comment \nthat \u201cit is disquieting to discover how sensitive the calculations of social \nsavings are to modest, and apparently reasonable, changes in Hawke\u2019s \nunderlying assumptions.\u201d Terry Gourvish is more critical, arguing that \n10 Fogel, \u201cNotes,\u201d pp. 10\u201311, equations 11 and 12: \n)1(\n)1)(1(\n11\n0\nz\n\u0010\u0010\n\u0010 \n\u0010\nH\nIH\nI H\nwhen\nS\nSt  (11) \n)1(\n1\nln\n0\n \n\u0010\n H\nI\nI\nwhen\nS\nSt  (12) \nWhere St is the true social saving, and S0 the zero elasticity social saving already calculated, \u0130\nthe elasticity, and I the ratio of prices without railways to with railways. The intuition is that the \nhigher the price ratio, the more journeys will not now take place. \n11 Hawke, Railways, pp. 48\u201349, table II.02. The figure of 2.1 percent is incorrect; it should be \n1.6 percent as given on p. 44. \n12 Baker, \u201cRailways,\u201d pp. 718\u201319. \n13 Ibid., p. 719. \n14 Fishlow, \u201cRailways,\u201d pp. 75\u201376. \nTime is Money 639 \nall we can safely conclude is that the actual value for passenger social \nsavings lies between 0.6 percent and 14.2 percent of GDP, bounds so \nwide as to tell us nothing about the value of railways to passengers.\n15\n Hawke does not include any benefit for time savings, arguing that in-\nflexibility of working hours meant that few workers were able to use the \nadditional time saved to work, so it is likely that it was primarily lei-\nsure, not production that increased. That said, he acknowledges that ex-\ncluding time savings imparts a downward bias, in that some travel was \nfor business purposes, and clearly faster journey times did allow greater \nproduction. He argues that this bias is likely to have been small, given \nthat the majority of miles traveled were third class. He also argues that \nbecause workers did not have a choice as to working hours, the theo-\nretical construct that workers value leisure at the wage rate is invalid, \nand therefore he regards such time saved as worthless. Finally, he notes \nthat if we are to compare leisure time savings with GNP, we would need \nto include the valuation of all leisure time in our estimate of GNP. \n Hayden Boyd and Gary Walton, who estimate the social saving from \nfaster passenger rail travel in the United States in 1890, argue that it is \nlegitimate to compare the value of time saved with money GNP provid-\ning that we interpret the social saving result carefully. They note that \nbecause much of the social saving from faster passenger travel comes \nfrom increased leisure time, the social saving \u201cmeasure does not show \nhow much GNP would have been reduced if the railroad had not been \navailable to travellers. It does show in the aggregate the percentage of \nGNP travellers in 1890 would have been willing to exchange for the \nopportunity of travelling by rail rather than by the next best alterna-\ntive.\u201d\n16\n This is in keeping with modern transport economics, which al-\nways includes the value of leisure time saved, on the clearly correct \ngrounds that people value leisure time.\n17\n Boyd and Walton note that, contrary to Fishlow\u2019s assumption, it was \ncheaper to travel by canal and steam boat than by railway, and yet peo-\nple overwhelmingly chose to travel by train. They note that an analysis \nincluding only fares would generate the clearly incorrect result that pas-\nsenger rail travel created negative social savings. That people chose to \nuse the more expensive railway rather than the cheaper boat must mean \nthat people were prepared to pay to save time, and therefore that eco-\nnomic historians should include that valuation in their estimate of social \nsavings.\n15 Gourvish, Railways, pp. 58\u201359, expressed here as a percentage of U.K. GDP for ease of \ncomparison. \n16 Boyd and Walton, \u201cSocial Savings,\u201d p. 240. \n17 A good discussion can be found in Harrison and Quarmby, \u201cValue.\u201d \n640 Leunig\n This article revises and extends Hawke\u2019s social savings for passenger \nrail travel in England and Wales. It seeks to achieve five things. First, to \nuse modern economics to value the time saved. Second, to improve the \nquality of Hawke\u2019s analysis of the monetary savings available from \nrailways for 1865. Third, to extend the time and money social savings \nestimates to cover the period 1843 to 1912. Fourth, to divide social sav-\nings into money and time components, and between premium and third-\nclass passengers. Finally, to express the social savings from passenger \nrail transport as a proportion of economy-wide total factor productivity \ngrowth. This article generates a better understanding of this new tech-\nnology\u2019s nature, the sources of its welfare gains and the distribution of \nthose gains. As the period progressed, time savings became relatively \nmore important relative to fare savings. This was not so much because \ntrains became quicker\u2014although they did\u2014but rather because over \ntime an increasing number of passengers were drawn from poorer sec-\ntions of society, whose only other realistic method of travel was to \nwalk. By 1912 passenger railways\u2019 social saving was 14 percent of \nGDP, of which 10 percent came from time saved, and 4 percent from \nreductions in fares. \nANALYSIS OF SOCIAL SAVINGS IN 1865 \n A social savings calculation requires an alternative, counterfactual, \nmode of transport. Hawke uses two different counterfactuals, one based \non Lardner\u2019s book\u2014first-class rail equivalent to inside a stage coach, \nother classes to seats outside the coach\u2014and another based on the 1867 \nRoyal Commission report\u2014equating first-class rail with traveling post \nchaise, second-class with inside the stage coach, and third-class with \noutside it. Hawke uses Lardner\u2019s comparison for years up to 1850, and \nthat of the Royal Commission for years from 1865, with a linear transi-\ntion from one \u201ccomfort comparison\u201d to the other, reflecting the steady \nrelative improvement in railway comfort. Philip Bagwell shows that \nposting passenger miles were almost as high as coaching miles prior to \nthe railway age, and that the number of post horses went down rapidly \nafter the introduction of railway services. It seems most plausible, there-\nfore, that first-class rail travel replaced posting as soon as the railway \nbegan. We therefore prefer the Royal Commission approach to that of \nLardner, and use it throughout this article.\n18\n18 Hawke argues that the nature of rail journeys meant that the only alternative was coaching, \nwith sea transport essentially irrelevant. In any case, steam ships depended on essentially the \nsame technology as railways, so a counterfactual of steam ships but not railways has little intui-\ntive appeal. \nTime is Money 641 \n We argue, however, that third-class passengers would not, in the ab-\nsence of the railways, have traveled by coach, but would instead have \nwalked. Although both Lardner and the Royal Commission base their \nthird-class comparisons on outside coach fares, there is ample evidence \nthat the sort of people who traveled third class would never have been \ncoach travelers, evidence noted by Eddie Hunt and acknowledged by \nHawke.\n19\n The Royal Commission itself noted this, arguing that \u201cThe \npoorer classes have benefited most in regard to speed, because formerly \nthey had no means of travelling except by wagon or on foot.\u201d\n20\n This is in \nkeeping with evidence given to various parliamentary enquires. For ex-\nample, Sir Rowland Hill, when describing the improvements brought \nabout by railways, notes that \u201ceven those whose best attainable means of \ntravelling were wagons proceeding at the rate of two or three miles an \nhour, are now conveyed by third-class carriages in tolerable comfort and \nwith great speed.\u201d\n21\n G. Duncan, the Director of the Dundee and Arbroath \nRailway, when asked how his third-class passengers would have traveled \nwithout the railways, stated \u201cThey had no means but going by the carri-\ners\u2019 carts or walking.\u201d\n22\n Captain Lawes, of the Manchester and Leeds \nRailroad, stated that third class on that railway was made up primarily of \nhandloom weavers who would otherwise have had to walk into Manches-\nter once a week, saving at least half a day per weaver per week.\n23\nMiles Traveled \n The first step in estimating social savings is to assess the number of \npassenger miles traveled in each class in 1865. Hawke takes the total \nrailway receipts and average fares by class in England and Wales from \nthe Railway Returns. These data are as authoritative as any nineteenth-\ncentury data. Dividing receipts by the fare per mile gives the number of \nmiles traveled. There are, as Hawke notes, \u201csome complications.\u201d\n24\nThese include return tickets, which had lower prices per mile, and ex-\npress tickets, which had higher prices. Hawke\u2019s assumptions to over-\ncome these problems are plausible, and the effects slight. The Railway \nReturns also give total revenues for season ticket holders, which represent \n3 percent of total revenues in 1865. The division of season ticket revenues \n19 Hawke, \u201cRailway Passenger Traffic\u201d; and Hunt, \u201cReview.\u201d \n20 Parliamentary Papers: Report from Commissioners: Railways, 1867, vol. 38, part 1, p. liii, \nparagraph 118. \n21 Parliamentary Papers: Report from Commissioners: Railways, 1867, vol. 38, part 1, p. cvii, \nparagraph 2. \n22 Parliamentary Papers 1840, vol. 13, p. 285 (479), paragraph 4,862. \n23 Parliamentary Papers 1840, vol. 13, pp. 242\u201343 (436\u201337), paragraphs 4,249\u20134,265. \n24 Hawke, Railways, p. 40. \n642 Leunig\nTABLE 1 \nMILES TRAVELED IN 1865  \n  1st Class  2nd Class  3rd Class   \nStandard  Season  Standard Season  Standard Season  Total \n1 Rail costs \n(\u00a3 million) 3.2 0.2 4.3 0.1 4.6 0.03  12.5 \n2 Rail fares \n(d \/ mile) 2.11 1.055 1.55 0.775 1.01 0.505   \n3 Miles (million) 367 52 659 43 1,089 12  2,223 \n4 Miles (million) 420  702  1,101  2,223 \nNote: Rounding errors make these numbers trivially different to those given in Hawke, Rail-\nways, p. 43. \nSources: Row 1: Railway Returns; row 2: Hawke, Railways, p. 43 and text; row 3: row 1 \/ row 2. \nby class is not generally available, but is given in the 1875 Railway Re-\nturns.\n25\n This shows that 58 percent of season ticket revenues came from \nfirst class, 35 percent from second class, and the remaining 7 percent from \nthird class.\n26\n We assume that this ratio holds for all years, and that the \nprice per mile was one-half the regular fare. This second assumption is ar-\nbitrary but plausible. It gives an overall average season ticket fare of \n0.92d, very close to Hawke\u2019s assumption of 0.9d (see Table 1). \nTIME SAVINGS \n We noted earlier that the modern transport literature views the cost of \ntransport as a generalized cost, made up of money and nonmoney com-\nponents. Although this method of expression is relatively new, the con-\ncept is not. Lardner, for example, included the time saving in his analy-\nsis of the importance of railways, and the Select Committee of 1854 and \nRoyal Commission of 1903\u20131904 were also aware of the issue.\n27\n The \nmodern economic literature is clear that all time, including nonworking \ntime, has a positive value. \n In the nineteenth century trains were much faster and often much \nmore frequent than coaches, and became both faster and more frequent \nover time. Furthermore, train companies believed that customers valued \nspeed: it played an important part of their advertising strategy, and they \nwere keen to set new records. In addition, faster trains were generally \nmore costly to operate, so given increasing speeds, we know that railway \ncompanies believed that passengers were prepared to pay more for faster \n25 Parliamentary Papers 1876, vol. 65, p. 98 (p. 226). \n26 Hawke assumed that all season ticket holders paid a third-class fare and so treats them as \nthird-class passengers for his analysis. \n27 Lardner, Railway Economy, p. 164; Parliamentary Papers 1854\u20131855, vol. 10 quarto, \npp. 1220\u201321; and Parliamentary Papers 1906, vol. 46, pp. 675\u201377. \nTime is Money 643 \ntravel. This would also fit with the finding that Britain had faster trains \nthan elsewhere in Europe: as the richest country, British people were ra-\ntionally prepared to pay more to save a given amount of time, and train \ncompanies catered for their needs accordingly.\n28\n In addition, the fastest \ntrains within Britain often required the purchase of an express ticket, \ndemonstrating a willingness on the part of travelers to pay to save time.\n There were two contemporaneous estimates of the value of faster \ntravel in Victorian Britain. Lardner argued that in 1848 coaches traveled \nat 7.5 mph and trains at 25 mph. With 170 million passenger miles the \ntime saved amounted to just under 16 million hours, which at Lardner\u2019s \nvalue of time of 6d per hour implies a saving of \u00a30.4 million.\n29\n Cham-\nbers\u2019 Journal, discussing the railways in 1854, was more optimistic, ar-\nguing that 111 million passenger hours were saved, which, even at a \nlower value of time of 4.5d per hour, gave a saving of \u00a32 million.\n30\n In \naddition, in his \u201chigh estimate\u201d of social savings for 1865, Gourvish in-\ncludes \u00a31 million for the value of time saved in 1865, whereas James \nForeman-Peck notes simply that \u201cit should be\u201d included.\n31\n In order to value the time saved, we first calculate average travel \nspeeds by rail and prerail methods, from which we calculate the number \nof hours saved. We do this using both the actual journey time itself, and \nincluding an allowance for the lag when the train (or coach) does not de-\npart at the traveler\u2019s preferred time. We then assess the value of one hour \nof time saved, and use that to calculate the value of total time saved. \nTrain Speeds\nAlthough we know that trains were faster than coaches, and that train \nspeeds increased over time, there has been no systematic study of aver-\nage train speeds. That is not to say that we know nothing\u2014Ernest Fox-\nwell and Thomas Farrer, for example, give good data on the number and \nspeed of express trains between 1871 and 1888\u2014but nevertheless our \nknowledge is surprisingly weak given the extent of the railway litera-\nture.\n32\n Thankfully, the surviving railway timetables mean that we are in \n28 Foxwell and Farrer, Express Trains, pp. 66, 163\u201379. \n29 Lardner, Railway Economy, p. 164. \n30 Quoted in Simmons, Victorian Railway, p. 373. \n31 He assumes coach and rail speeds of 10 and 30 mph respectively, but only attributes value \nto the time of 20 percent of passengers, that is, 445.69m passenger miles, with time valued at 8d \nper hour. Gourvish, Railways, p. 59. Foreman-Peck, New Perspectives.\n32 Foxwell and Farrer, Express Trains, pp. 66\u201369. Thus, for example, Bagwell\u2019s generally au-\nthoritative book makes no mention of railway speeds prior to 1914 (Bagwell, Transport Revolu-\ntion), Ville simply writes of \u201csubstantial improvements in speeds.\u201d Ville, \u201cTransport,\u201d p. 307; \nwhereas Thomas notes only that \u201cLocomotives roared through the countryside at speeds of up to \n40 miles per hour,\u201d Thomas, \u201cService Sector,\u201d p. 102. \n644 Leunig\na good position to calculate the speed of any given train journey. Brad-\nshaw\u2019s Railway Timetables, published monthly, give the scheduled time \nof departure and arrival for every train in the United Kingdom, and Alan \nBates\u2019s Directory of Stage Coach Services does the same for coaches in \n1836.\n33\n It is obviously not practical to computerize every journey, and \nnor, having done so, would we be able to allocate passengers to each \njourney with any degree of accuracy. Instead we construct two samples, \nconsisting of 50 \u201cimportant\u201d and 222 \u201cminor\u201d journeys respectively.\n34\n The important routes are defined by the likely traffic on them.\n35\nThese include the obvious intercity pairs, such as London to Birming-\nham, but also many shorter but high density routes, such as London to \nReading and Manchester to Oldham.\n36\n For these 50 routes we comput-\nerized every journey on each route in 1836, 1850, 1870, 1887, and \n1910. The timetables give the time of every journey during the day, but \nsimply averaging these would overstate the average time taken, because \npeople will not take an earlier train if it will be overtaken en route by a \nlater-leaving, but faster-traveling, service.\n37\n We eliminate trains and \ncoaches that were overtaken, which leaves 342 \u201cuseful\u201d coach journeys \nfor 1836, and an average of 884 \u201cuseful\u201d train journeys for each of the \nfour railway benchmark years. We average the times taken by these \ntrains on each route, and then average across routes to find the overall \naverage for that year.\n38\n We calculate miles per hour by dividing the \n33 Of course, neither trains nor coaches would always have operated precisely to their time- \ntables, but it seems more likely that punctuality was better on the railways than on coaches, and \nthat punctuality improved over time. Thus although timetables will overstate the true speeds, the \neffect is likely to be small and declining over time. Bradshaw, \u201cBradshaw\u2019s\u201d; and Bates, Directory.\n34 Sample size was determined to generate stable results. Thus, for example, the additional of \njourneys 45\u201350 did not alter our speed estimates; similarly, restricting our minor journeys sam-\nple to looking only at places with a population of over 15,000 does not alter our estimates. This \ngives us confidence that our sample generates accurate results. \n35 We ranked journeys by the product of the population of the two places, divided by the dis-\ntance. This captures two intuitions: that more journeys will be made when there are more people \nin the two places (the benefit of travel increases), but that there are likely to be fewer journeys if \nthe distance is long (the cost of travel increases). In effect this model assumes that people travel \nto meet other people, rather than to visit a scenic place, such as the seaside, and has the charac-\nteristics of a gravity equation. \n36 A full list is given in the Appendix. \n37 For tractability we limit ourselves to weekday trains. \n38 Rather than using a simple average for each route, we follow best practice and use a \u201ctwin-\npeak\u201d weighted average, that is, we assume more people wish to travel at peak times than at off-\npeak times, and give higher weight to trains at those times in calculating the average speeds on \neach route in each benchmark year. We experimented with many different weightings, including \nuniform demand over the 24 hour period. Contrary to expectations, the pattern of demand does \nnot alter the results by more than a few minutes, and does not alter the final social savings re-\nsults. Both coaches and trains were sufficiently frequent, and uniform enough in speed, that the \nprecise allocation of passengers to individual trains is of no great importance. Route speeds are \naveraged in proportion to the route\u2019s importance, as defined by the likely traffic on the route. \nWe assume any passenger could have traveled on any train. In reality this was not the case in \nTime is Money 645 \n\u201ccrow flies\u201d mileage between the two towns by the time taken. We use \n\u201ccrow flies\u201d rather than \u201ctrack\u201d or \u201croad\u201d miles because this is what \nmatters to travelers. This also has the useful property that the construc-\ntion of a shorter line, on which trains travel at the same speed, counts as \nan increase in speed.\n39\n As a rule of thumb, track mile speeds exceed \ncrow flies speeds by around 15 percent. \n Speeds on important routes were higher than on more minor routes. \nTo find the speeds on minor routes we took a simple average of the \nspeed of the first train after 7AM into each of the 222 towns with a \npopulation over 12,500 in 1901, in each of our four railway benchmark \nyears.\n40\n We do not know the times of coaches on these routes, so we \nsimply assume that they traveled at the same speed as coaches on pri-\nmary routes. This is generous towards coaches, because both the quality \nof roads and reduced competition on minor routes would have reduced \ncoaching speeds. We average the speeds on important and minor jour-\nneys to find the overall average speed for each of our benchmark \nyears.\n41\n The results are given in Table 2. The equivalent speeds for \ncoaches are 7.8 mph,\n42\n and for walking we use a value of 2.5 mph, the \nhighest figure recommended by the Ramblers\u2019 Association for estimat-\ning journey speeds.\n43\n This is a relatively generous figure, because it \nonly applies to adults walking on level or downhill routes, and is a \nroute-miles speed, not a crow flies speed. It would certainly be possible \nto make a good case for, say, a crow flies speed of 2 mph. \n                                                                                                          \nthe early years, when not all trains had third-class carriages. This bias is small, because only a \nsmall proportion of passengers traveled in third class in the early years. \n39 Thus, for example, the Great Western Railway shortened routes from London to South \nWales and the West by building new cuttings through hills it previous detoured around. As \nsuch, it lost its nickname of the \u201cGreat Way Round.\u201d Cain, \u201cRailways,\u201d p. 93. \n40 Journeys over two hours were excluded, and the remainder varied from the very short \n(Glossop to Dinting, 1 km) to the rather long (Peterborough to Doncaster 120 km), the average \nwas 28 km. The towns are listed in the Appendix. \n41 We give important journeys a weighting of 52 percent. This is based on working out the \nimplicit demand for travel between each of the 185 towns and each of the other 36,000 settle-\nments in Britain listed in the Ordnance Survey Gazetteer, according to the earlier formula that \nimplicit demand equals the product of populations divided by the distance, with a minimum dis-\ntance of 5 km. Of total implicit demand, we assume that the average speed for important jour-\nneys holds only for those journeys themselves, with other journeys over 120 km being proxied \nby the simple average of important and minor journeys speeds, and all other journeys under \n120 km by the minor journey speed. It is possible to argue for different weights, but given the \nnumbers it is hard to see the overall average presented here being wrong by more than two or \nthree miles per hour at most. \n42 Bates, Directory, important routes. \n43 http:\/\/www.ramblers.org.uk\/info\/practical\/navigation.html#Planning. The recommendation \nis three to four km per hour, we use four km.

Minor \njourneys generally stopped at more stations en route, which limited the \npotential for cutting journey times. Overall, a rise in speeds from 7.8 \nand 2.5 mph in the prerailway era to 20 and then later to 28 mph in the \nrailway era represents a major improvement in quality for consumers. \nTable 3 sets out the number of hours saved. \n Railways were much faster than the alternatives. The time needed to \ntravel fell by over eighty percent, to 99 million hours. It is worth em-\nphasizing that this figure is robust. Were trains to have been 10 percent \nslower, the overall time saved would fall by under 2.5 percent. In con-\ntrast, were William Summerhill\u2019s assumption that walkers would have \naveraged 2 miles per hour, rather than 2.5, to be accurate, the number of \nhours saved would increase by more than 20 percent, to 595 million \nhours. As we have noted, our assumption of 2.5 miles per hour is the \nhighest plausible average and as such the number of hours saved is al-\nmost certainly too low rather than too high. The vast majority\u2014over \nthree-quarters\u2014of time saved was saved by third-class travelers, both \nbecause they represented the largest single category of traveler, and be-\ncause their alternative methods of transport\u2014walking, or wagons mov-\ning at walking pace\u2014were very slow. As with all social savings num-\nbers, we need to be careful as to how these figures are used. Just as \nHawke\u2019s social saving figure of \u00a348 million did not mean that society \nspent \u00a348 million less on transport in 1865 than at some previous date, \nneither does Table 3 mean that 485 million hours were actually saved. \nRather, it tells us that to make the journeys made by rail, without the \nrailways, would have taken an additional 485 million hours. \nService Frequency\n We know that trains were more frequent than coaches, and that peo-\nple value frequency, because it reduces the overall journey time. Con-\ntemporaries appreciated this.

This was particularly true for longer jour-\nneys. Thus, for example, all London to Leeds and London to Liverpool \nservices departed in the afternoon, whereas the six coaches to Manches-\nter all went either first thing in the morning, or in the early evening, \nwith no departures between 8.30AM and 5.30PM, or after 7.45PM.\n45\n That \nsaid, passengers could choose their departure times for two modes of \ntravel: walking, and traveling in a private chaise. \n We model the effects of changing frequencies. For very frequent ser-\nvices (say, six per hour or more), the evidence is that people turn up \nrandomly, and catch the next available service. In this case average \nwaiting time (half the service interval) can simply be added to the jour-\nney time. When frequencies decrease, people cease to arrive at the sta-\ntion randomly. Although this means that average waiting times at the \nstation do not increase much as frequencies decline, passengers do incur \ndisutility because the train does not go at the time that they would like it \nto, forcing them to remain in one place when they would by definition \nrather be in another. They can use the time in the original place, but it is \nworth less to them than that time would be at their destination. The \ntransport economics literature converts the nominal waiting time (the \ntime between preferred and the actual departure time), into what is \n44 Parliamentary Papers 1840, vol. 13 p. 112 (306), paragraph 2,327, p. 115, (309), paragraph \n2,392.\n45 Bates, Directory, pp. 30, 32, 34\u201336. \n648 Leunig\ntermed \u201cin-vehicle time\u201d (IVT) equivalent minutes. This is the addi-\ntional in-vehicle time assessed as having equal disutility to the delay in \nleaving. Waits of up to ten minutes are simply added onto the journey \ntime, but (nominal) waits of over ten minutes are valued less highly, be-\ncause the person can do something in their place of departure. \n Mark Wardman reports that current U.K. practice is to convert nomi-\nnal waiting times into in-vehicle equivalent times by multiplying the \nformer by one for times up to ten minutes, and by 0.8, 0.55, and 0.43 for \nhalf-hourly, hourly and two-hourly services.\n46\n There is no best practice \nfor the value of very long gaps between services, so we use an arbitrary \nbut plausible value of 0.1 for 12-hourly gaps. We then convert these ob-\nservations into a smooth series.\n47\n This tells us that a departure 30 min-\nutes after the passenger would like to leave has the same disutility as \none that departs at exactly the preferred time, but takes 23 minutes \nlonger. Similarly a one hour gap is equivalent to a 35 minute longer \njourney, a two hour gap to 51 minutes, and a 12 hour gap to 82 minutes. \nThe falling marginal cost reflects the fact that the longer you have, the \nbetter you are able to deploy your time usefully, and so the marginal \ndisutility is lower. \n There were almost four times as many useful services on important \nroutes in 1910 as in 1836 or 1850, but there were still sufficient coach \nand train services in the earlier years that increasing frequencies did not \nradically alter the pattern of overall improvement given by the in-\nvehicle speeds themselves. The same is true for trains on minor jour-\nneys. As we noted earlier, we recorded details of the first train to arrive \nafter 7AM in each town, and so the wait after 7AM can reasonably be \ntaken as a measure of the nominal waiting time. This falls from 74 to 53 \nminutes between 1850 and 1910, or 34 to 30 IVT equivalent minutes\u2014a \ntrivial improvement. The hardest calculation to make is the fall in wait-\ning times from coaches to the initial trains, because we have virtually no \ninformation about coaches on minor journeys. That said, the issue is \nsecond order, as only second-class passengers are assumed to travel by \ncoach. If we assume one coach per day on minor routes the average \nnominal wait would be 12 hours, equivalent to 82 IVT minutes, which \nreduces the average speed from 7.8 mph to 5.6 mph. In contrast we as-\nsume that both private coaches and walkers did not have to wait at all: \nboth could set out at a time of their choosing. The full results are given \n46 Wardman, \u201cPublic Transport,\u201d paragraph 2.5. \n47 We regress these conversion factor onto time and log time, to get the result that the conver-\nsion factor equals 1.58 + 0.0002time \u2013 0.57logtime. This predicts values of 0.99, 0.75, 0.58, \n0.43 and 0.1 for gaps of 11, 30, 60, 120 and 1,440 minutes, very close to the values given by \nWardman.\nTime is Money 649 \nTABLE 4 \nTRAIN SPEEDS AT DIFFERENT DATES, CROW FLIES MILES PER HOUR, INCLUDING \nALLOWANCE FOR WAITING \n  Important Journeys  Minor Journeys  All Journeys \n1850  19.4  11.1  15.1 \n1870  24.2  11.2  17.4 \n1887  28.2  11.7  19.6 \n1910  32.0  13.0  22.1 \nNotes.

Including frequency in the analy-\nsis proves to have little effect, with an overall time saving different \nby under 1 percent. This is caused by two factors. First, the delay to \nsecond-class passengers in waiting for the relatively infrequent stage \ncoach was sufficient to offset the delays for first- and third-class pas-\nsengers waiting for the train. Second, Britain was already a remarka-\nbly developed economy prior to the railway. Stage coach services \nwere particularly extensive on core routes, but were also well estab-\nlished on relatively minor cross country journeys. Bates records regu-\nlar, usually daily, services on 786 different routes excluding those \nthat started or ended in London.\n48\n The finding that the British trans-\nport system was well developed in the prerailway era fits with recent \nwork by Dan Bogart, which looks at the significance of turnpike \ntrusts in speeding up coach journeys.\n49\n It is also in keeping with re-\ncent work by Nicholas Crafts and Abay Mulatu, which finds that \nBritish railways did not lead to a geographical relocation of produc-\ntion: previous transport had been sufficiently good to allow industry \nto be located in economically efficient locations.\n50\n Because the fig-\nures for time saved are so similar, we limit ourselves to considering \nonly in-vehicle time saved. \n48 Bates, Directory, pp. 85\u2013138. \n49 Bogart, \u201cTunpike Trusts.\u201d \n50 Crafts and Mulatu, \u201cLocation.\u201d \n650 Leunig\nTABLE 5\nTIME SAVINGS IN 1865, INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF FREQUENCY \n  1st Class 2nd Class 3rd Class Total\n1 Miles (million)  420 702 1,101  2,223 \n2 Prerail speed (mph)  7.8 5.6 2.5   \n3 Prerail time (million hours)  54 125 440  620 \n4 Rail speed (mph)  16.9 16.9 16.9   \n5 Rail time (million hours)  25 42 65  132 \n6 Time saved (million hours)  29 84 375  488 \nNotes: These results are robust to any plausible change in rail speeds, but upwardly sensitive to \nany downward revision to walking speeds. \nSources: Row 1: Table 1; row 2: see text; row 3: row 1 \/ row 2; row 4: Table 2 and text; row 5: \nrow 1 \/ row 4; row 6: row 3 \u2013 row 5.  \nThe Value of Time Saved\nAs we noted earlier, the value of time saved during working hours is \ntaken as the gross wage rate.\n51\n For 1867 Edwin Chadwick estimated that \nthe average wage of a third-class passenger was 6.5d per hour.\n52\n This is \naround twice Charles Feinstein\u2019s estimate of average working-class \nearnings for men and women at this date, reflecting that fact that even \nthird-class rail travel was relatively expensive and travelers correspond-\ningly more affluent than average. The average member of the working \nclass could afford to travel a little over three miles for one hour\u2019s \nwages, approximately one-tenth of the distance that a modern typical \nBritish worker could travel for the same effort.\n53\n In keeping with the \nmodern literature, we assume people who traveled in premium classes \n(in this case first- and second-class travel) were affluent, and value their \ntime at 16.8d per hour, which, when indexed via the Feinstein wage se-\nries, equates to \u00a3250 per 2,300 hour year in 1911, a decent but not spec-\ntacular wage.\n54\n The next issue is the proportion of people traveling during work time, \nand the proportion of commuting and leisure travel. As we noted earlier, \nthose traveling on business should have their time proxied by wage \ncosts, whereas those who were traveling in their own time should have \n51 In modern studies it is necessary to include overhead costs, but there were no payroll taxes \nand few employer-funded benefits in the nineteenth century, so overhead costs would have been \nsmall enough for us to disregard them without any significant loss of precision. \n52 Edwin Chadwick, Parliamentary Papers: Report from Commissioners: Railways, 1867, vol. \n38, part 1, p. 838, paragraph 17,181. \n53 Average earnings for both sexes.

We simply do not know what proportion of travelers in any class \nwere traveling on business in 1865. The sensible way to proceed is to \nassume first that all travel was on business, and second that no travel \nwas on business, and then to consider the plausible bounds within \nthese extreme cases. \n Table 6 gives a range of figures from \u00a314 million to \u00a317 million \ndepending on the proportion of premium class passenger traveling on \nbusiness. It seems implausible to believe that\u2014say\u2014less than one-\nquarter or more than three-quarters were traveling in work time. As \nsuch, the plausible bounds are \u00a314.7 million\u2014\u00a316.3 million. Our \ncentral estimate\u2014\u00a315.5 million\u2014simply assumes that half of those \nin premium classes were on business. It is possible to argue for other \nproportions traveling on business, but it would seem hard to imagine \nthat this estimate is out by more than \u00a31 million. Similarly, because \nwe have good evidence for the average wage of those traveling by \nthird class, it is only the wage that we assign to the premium-class \npassengers that is a source of possible error. Again, the size of any \nerror is limited: were we to raise or lower that wage by as much as a \nthird, the estimate of the value of time saved would change by only \n10 percent. \u00a315.5 million is a significant sum, and represents over 2 \npercent of GDP. Time savings clearly mattered.\nMONETARY COSTS \n Table 7 sets out Hawke\u2019s estimates of the monetary savings that \ncame from the railway\u2019s invention. He assesses the alternative cost of \ntravel in 1865 at \u00a360m, which gives a social saving of \u00a348 million, or \n5.8 percent of GDP. \n652 Leunig\nTABLE 7\nSOCIAL SAVINGS: HAWKE\u2019S 1865 ESTIMATES \n   1st Class  2nd Class  3rd Class  Season  Total \n1 Miles (million)  367 659 1,089 106  2,220 \n2 Rail fares (d \/ mile)  2.11 1.55 1.01 0.9   \n3 Rail costs (\u00a3 million)  3.2 4.3 4.6 0.4  12.5 \n4 Prerail fares (d \/ mile)  24 4 2.5 2.5   \n5 Prerail costs (\u00a3 million)  36.7 11.0 11.3 1.1  60.1 \n6 Rail saving (\u00a3 million)  33.5 6.7 6.8 0.7  47.7 \nNote and Source: rounding errors make these numbers trivially different to those given in \nHawke Railways, pp. 43\u201344. \nRevisions to Hawke\u2019s Money Social Savings \n We make three revisions to the calculation of monetary social savings \nfor 1865. First, we noted earlier that data from the Railway Returns al-\nlows us to allocate season ticket holders more accurately across \nclasses.\n55\n We assume, unlike Hawke, that first-class season ticket hold-\ners would have traveled as did other first-class ticket holders in the ab-\nsence of railways. This seems more plausible than assuming that they \nwould travel as did third-class ticket holders: even at half the standard \nfirst-class price per mile, a first-class season ticket was not cheap, and \nsuch a person must have been from the more affluent part of society. \nCeteris paribus, this raises the social savings estimate, because it in-\ncreases the number of counterfactual journeys estimated to have been \nmade using post-chaise and inside coach seats. \n Hawke reports coaching costs as 4d inside, and 2.5d outside, similar \nto figures given elsewhere.\n56\n He gives the cost of posting as 2s per per-\nson per mile, which cannot be correct. Fishlow drew attention to the \nvery high\u20146:1\u2014ratio between the cost of posting and the cost of trav-\neling inside a carriage.\n57\n No other author suggests such a ratio, with \nBagwell, for example, arguing that the cost of posting was \u201cat least \ntwice as expensive\u201d as traveling inside a coach. The 2s cost, mentioned \nin the Royal Commission and elsewhere, is in fact for a post-chaise per \nmile, not per person per mile.\n58\n As a chaise could carry three or four \n55 Parliamentary Papers 1876, vol. 65, p. 98 (p. 226). \n56 Copeland, Roads, p. 93. As Gourvish has noted, Hawke mistakenly used the cost of inside, \nrather than outside, the coach for second-class rail travel in his table II.02 Lardner counterfac-\ntual, which overstates the social saving by a quarter. The number given in the text on page 44 is \ncorrect.

Charging per coach rather than per person is to be expected because the costs \nwere essentially invariant in the number of passengers. This is generally clear from the context, \nbut is made explicit in a 1761 advert in The Ipswich Journal, the 1802 accounts of a Suffolk \nTime is Money 653 \npeople, the cost per mile was between 6d (four people in the chaise) and \n2s (one person).\n59\n There are two further reasons to believe that posting \nwas on average cheaper than 2s per mile. First, the cost of posting var-\nied in time and space, with many references to costs lower than 2s. \nEarly-nineteenth-century editions of The Times include four references \nto the cost of hiring a chaise being 1s, eight to 1s 3d, and two to 1s 6d. \nThere are no references to costs above this, although one reference \nnotes that the cost had fallen to 1s 6d, implying that they had once been \nhigher, and higher prices were perhaps less likely to be advertised.\n60\n In \ntheir evidence to the 1837 Committee on taxation, both Henry Gray and \nThomas Cass argued that they would be able to provide posting at 1s \nper mile were the tax to be abolished.\n61\n Similarly, John Copeland re-\nports various early-nineteenth-century advertisements for a post chaise \nand pair of horses at 1s\u20131s 6d per mile.\n62\n Although tolls may have been \nin addition, it is clear that some journeys could be done \u201cpost haste\u201d for \nless than 2s per mile. Finally, it seems likely that the 2s included the \ncost of hiring a postillion to return the horses at the end of the stage, and \nthe tolls on the horses on their return. Given that the average first-class \nrail journey was under 15 miles long in 1865, some journeys would \nhave been short round trips for which it would have been cheaper, when \ntraveling by chaise, to have retained the horses at the destination until \nreturn, rather than paying the postillion and tolls for the return legs.\n63\nWe have no reliable information as to how many people traveled in the \ntypical chaise, but given that they could carry three and perhaps four \npeople, and given that 2s appears to be towards the upper end of  \n                                                                                                          \npostmaster, a 1793 article in The Leicester Journal, and the 1823 Best family account books, all \nquoted in Copeland, Roads, pp. 155\u201359. In addition, articles in The Times always refer to the \ncost of hiring a chaise and pair per mile, with no suggestion that this is per person per mile.

That statement also gives us plausible \nbounds for sensitivity analysis, namely 8\u201312d per passenger mile. Fi-\nnally, as we noted earlier, we assume that third-class passengers would \nnot, in the absence of the railways, have traveled by coach, but would \ninstead have walked. Both of these last two changes reduce the social \nsaving available from railways, by reducing the cost of the alternative \ncounterfactual means of transport. \n Notwithstanding the ceteris paribus rise in the estimate of social sav-\nings from the better assignment of season ticket revenues, the figures \ngiven in Table 8 are much lower than those presented by Hawke. The \nskepticism of Baker and Fishlow proves to be well-founded.\n 65\n Hawke\u2019s \noriginal estimates were criticized for their sensitivity to the cost of post-\ning. That remains a potential criticism of these estimates too, albeit not \nto the same extent. Although 10d per passenger mile is a reasonable es-\ntimate, it would be possible to make a reasonable case for anything in \nthe range 8\u201312d, although figures outside this range are less plausible. \nMoving to either extreme of this plausibility band would alter the mone-\ntary social saving by \u00a33.5 million, or 20 percent. That is clearly a sig-\nnificant amount, but it should be noted that these are the extremes of the \nplausible ranges. \n As we now have a revised figure for the monetary saving, and a fig-\nure for the value of time saved, we can calculate the total social saving. \n64 Mr. Henry Gray, Chairman of the Association of the Postmasters, stated that four would be \naverage, but because this is the maximum, it is hard to believe that this was also the average. \nParliamentary Papers 1837, vol. 20, p. 9 (305), paragraph 145. \n65 The 10d figure can also be applied to other estimates. Thus, for example, Gourvish\u2019s upper-\nbound social saving falls from \u00a3128.2m to \u00a362.1m, and from 22.9 percent to 12.6 percent of \nEngland and Wales GDP.

Hawke\u2019s third class includes \nseason tickets. \nHawke divides the social saving for railways in England and Wales by \nGDP for the United Kingdom. As Gourvish noted, this is inappropri-\nate.\n66\n In his recent work on British regional GDP, Crafts finds that in \n1871 England and Wales accounted for 79 percent of U.K. GDP, a ratio \nthat we assume holds for 1865, implying 1865 England and Wales GDP \nof \u00a3649 million.\n67\n Table 9 tells us that both the time and money savings were signifi-\ncant, and of approximately equal magnitude. Together they amount to \n5 percent of England and Wales GDP, one-third lower than Hawke\u2019s es-\ntimate. For premium passengers the gains were primarily monetary: \nlower fares represent around 90 percent and 70 percent of the total gains \nto first- and second-class passengers respectively. For third-class pas-\nsengers the picture is very different: their fares increased by \u00a34.6 mil-\nlion, but they saved \u00a310.6 million worth of time. \n We noted earlier that social savings are equivalent to (cumulative) \nTFP growth. It is thus straightforward to express the social savings re-\nsults given here as a percentage of economy wide TFP growth in this \nera. Monetary social savings of 2.6 percent by 1865 equate to an annual \nrate of 0.07 percent between the opening of the Liverpool and Manches-\nter Railway in 1830 and 1865. This accounts for 9.7 percent of econ-\nomy-wide TFP growth of 0.75 percent in this era.\n68\n In addition, time so-\ncial savings of 2.4 percent in 1865 equate to a further TFP increment of \n66 Ibid., p. 36. \n67 Crafts, \u201cRegional GDP.\u201d \n68 Crafts, \u201cSteam,\u201d table 1.

Crafts\u2019s economy-wide TFP figures include only \ncontributions to measured GDP. Including time savings raises the econ-\nomy-wide estimate of TFP to 0.82 percent per annum, of which the \nmonetary, time, and total savings from passenger rail improvements \nrepresent 8.8 percent, 8.3 percent, and 17.1 percent respectively. These \nare large numbers\u2014on this measure railways accounted for one-sixth of \nall productivity improvements in the mid-nineteenth century, and reflect \nthe important role of railways in this era. \n That railways were a \u201chigh technology\u201d good can also be demon-\nstrated by looking at the rate of price falls (TFP growth) compared with \nthose elsewhere in the economy. Table 9 shows that the monetary and \ntime costs of a representative 1,000 passenger miles of travel in 1865 \nwere \u00a35 6s 7d and \u00a32 1s 7d respectively. Using prerailway (1830) travel \ntechnology these costs would have been \u00a312 10s 4d and \u00a39 9s 2d, falls \nof 2.5 percent and 4.4 percent per annum respectively. These are con-\nsiderably higher than U.K.-wide TFP growth, confirming the status of \nrailways as a high technology product. \n We noted earlier that the social savings methodology overstates the \ngain in consumer surplus, because it implicitly assumes zero price elas-\nticity of demand. Table 10 sets out the ratio of consumer surplus to so-\ncial savings at different elasticities. \n By definition, the different elasticity assumptions give significantly \ndifferent results, from 1.9 percent of GDP to 5 percent of GDP. In their \nanalysis of U.S. passenger railways Boyd and Walton assume unitary \nprice elasticity, an assumption endorsed by Fogel, and used by others, \nincluding most recently Summerhill.\n69\n In addition, modern transport \neconomics uses a similar rule.\n70\n Foreman-Peck suggests a value of 1.5, \nbased on the experience of the Glasgow and Greenock Railway in 1842. \nBecause, however, that railway simultaneously cut prices and improved \nthe carriages, that elasticity of 1.5 is the aggregate of the effect of fal-\nling prices and quality improvements, and so must over-estimate the \nprice elasticity. The standard value in other historical and contemporary \nstudies\u2014unity\u2014implies a reduction in the welfare gain of 42 percent; \nusing a value of 1.25 suggests a reduction of 48 percent, so it is safe to \nconclude that consumer surplus rose by one-half, or slightly more than \none-half, of the social saving estimate, implying a gain to society of at \nleast \u00a32.5 million by 1865. \n69 Boyd and Walton and Fogel also give figures for other elasticities, from zero to two, Sum-\nmerhill also notes other studies that have used unitary elasticity.

First, we assess the fares and miles traveled \nprior to 1865, for which good data are available. Next we assess the \nsame for the period after 1865, for which the data are poorer. Third we \ncalculate and value the time saved, and finally assess the money sav-\nings. We then discuss the magnitude and changing nature of the results \nover time. \nData for Years Prior to 1865 \n Hawke uses Lardner\u2019s passenger mile estimates for 1843\u20131848, and \nthe Railway Returns until 1870, when his analysis stops.\n71\n We make a \nfew small changes to the procedure followed by Hawke. First, he uses \npassenger mileage figures given in the Railway Returns from July 1851 \nto December 1859. However, a few companies did not submit passenger \nmileage returns between 1851 and 1855. We add a proportionate allow-\nance to passenger miles, based on their train miles, raising total passen-\nger miles by 1 to 5 percent, depending on the year. Because rail receipts \nremain unaltered, and nonrail costs rise 1\u20135 percent with the additional \nmiles, the social savings rise. The effect is, however, small, never ex-\nceeding 0.3 percentage points. \n Second, between 1852 and 1859 a few companies, never accounting \nfor more than 3 percent of the total passenger miles, did not divide their \npassenger miles by class. Hawke allocates them to the third class, we \n71 Hawke, Railways, pp. 45\u201347. Gourvish is sceptical about Hawke\u2019s reliance on Lardner, but \nthat scepticism is not well founded. Both Lardner and the Railway Returns give figures for \n1845\u20131848, and the two series are identical. For that reason is seems reasonable to trust Lard-\nner\u2019s figures for 1843\u20131844. Gourvish, Railways, p. 38; and Lardner, Railway Economy, p. 163. \n658 Leunig\ndistribute them pro-rata, in line with the average of other companies. \nAgain, this raises the social saving, because it increases the alternative \nnonrail cost, without altering the rail cost. The estimate of social sav-\nings rises by a maximum of 0.2 percentage points.\n72\n We know both receipts and fares per mile by class for the periods \n1843\u20131848, July 1851\u2013December 1859, and for 1865. It is therefore \nfairly straightforward to divide the former by the latter to find the num-\nber of passenger miles. We interpolate fares per mile for 1849\u2013June \n1851 and 1860\u20131864 from observations immediately on either side, and \nuse these prices to calculate miles traveled from the receipts given in \nRailway Returns. The price per mile was very stable in this period, so \nthis cannot involve any significant error. \nData for Years After 1865 \n Our numbers for the post-1865 period are, like Hawke\u2019s, less precise \nbecause no information on average fares is available, and season tickets, \nworkman\u2019s and excursion fares become more important. Like Hawke, \nwe note William Acworth and W. T. Stephenson\u2019s statement that the \naverage fare fell to 0.55d per mile by the outbreak of war.\n73\n The issue is \nassessing the pattern of fare reductions between 1865 and 1912. In the \nabsence of other evidence, we assume that fares fell linearly over time \nand evenly by class. We assume, therefore, that average fares, including \nall discounts, season tickets, and so on, fell from 2.11d in 1865 to 1.02d \nby 1912, from 1.55 to 0.75d and 1 to 0.5d, in each class respectively. \nThis gives an average fare of 0.56d in 1912, which is very close to the \nnumber proposed by Acworth and Stephenson. There are two other es-\ntimates of fares, by P. J. Cain and by George Paish. Cain suggests 0.75d \nand 0.6d per mile in 1900 and 1912, which are close enough to our fig-\nures of 0.71d and 0.56d.\n74\n Paish gives fares for the five main railway \ncompanies for 1900, which when averaged give 0.775d per mile.\n75\n This \nis higher than both our estimate and that of Cain, probably reflecting \nhigher prices on the faster, mainline routes that make up Paish\u2019s sample. \nIn short, our figures are plausible, even though they lack the authority of \nthe earlier data. We then divide receipts\u2014given in Railway Returns for \nall years\u2014by the estimated fares per mile, to give the number of miles \ntraveled in each class. \n72 In general there were more companies with undivided passenger mile figures in years in \nwhich there were fewer companies submitting no passenger mile data. As such those two in-\ncrements are to some extent alternatives.  \n73 Acworth and Stephenson, Elements, p. 207. \n74 Cain, \u201cRailways,\u201d p. 124. \n75 Paish, Railway Position, pp. 40, 180, 202, 222, and 285. \nTime is Money 659 \nFIGURE 1\nANNUAL PASSENGER MILES, 1843\u20131912 \nSources: Lardner, Railway Economy; and Railway Returns.\nSecond-class mileage peaked in 1871, after which time the number \nof second-class passenger miles fell in absolute terms for some years, \nas railway companies began to move to a two-class system (known as \nfirst and third classes). It was the third class, rather than the first, that \ngained. It would be wrong, however, to assume that people who now \ntraveled third class, but would have traveled second class in earlier \nyears, would have walked in the absence of the railway. To avoid \nthat implication, we construct a pseudo-second class from 1872 on-\nwards, which simply follows first-class traffic, at the 1871 first- to \nsecond-class ratio. The pseudo-third class is then the actual number \nof third-class passengers, less those who are transferred into the \npseudo-second class.\n76\n 194 million passenger miles are transferred \nfrom third class to the pseudo-second class in 1872, rising to 1.4 bil-\nlion passenger miles in 1912. This procedure lowers the value of time \nsaved, but raises the monetary social savings estimate. For simplicity \nwe refer to the pseudo-second and pseudo-third classes simply as \nsecond and third classes from here on. Both the actual and revised \nmileages are given in Figure 1. \n76 The pseudo second class is 50 percent larger than the actual second class by 1900, whereas \nthe pseudo third class is 5 percent smaller than the actual third class.

We continue our earlier as-\nsumptions that those in first and second classes would otherwise have \ntraveled by coach, and that those in third class would otherwise have \nwalked.\n77\n The number of hours saved rose dramatically over the railway era, \nfrom 54 million hours in 1843, to 527 million hours in 1866, and finally \nto 5 billion hours by 1912, roughly equal to the hours worked by 1.8 \nmillion workers (see Figure 2). The number of hours saved rises more \nsharply over time than passenger miles, because over time an increasing \nproportion of those traveling by train were third-class passengers. Even \nat the very beginning the third class accounted for over half the hours \nsaved, rising to 80 percent by 1860, and 90 percent by 1880. The Royal \n77 Obviously the further on from the invention of the railways, the harder it is to construct a \nplausible nonrail counterfactual. Society was richer in 1912 than 70 years before, and some \ntraveling in third class would by then have used the coach rather than walk. Similarly, the bicy-\ncle became more practical over time, and fell in price after 1900. The assumption that all third-\nclass passengers would have walked is therefore less likely to be true for 1912 than for earlier. \nThat said, we have already allocated 1.4 billion passenger miles from third to second class\u2014and \nthus from walking to coach, and even in 1907, after the big price falls, only one bicycle was \nsold per 75 people in Britain. \n0\n1,000\n2,000\n3,000\n4,000\n5,000\n1840 1850 1860 1870 1880 1890 1900 1910\nTotal\n1st & 2nd\n3rd class\nm\nil\nli\no\nn\n h\no\nu\nrs\n \n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\nt l\nt  \nr  l\nm\nil\nli\no\nn\n h\no\nu\nrs\n \nTime is Money 661 \nCommission was correct: the poorer classes did benefit most in terms of \nspeed.\n78\n We now go on to value these hours. For first- and second-class trav-\nelers we use an annual wage of \u00a3250 in 1911, projected backwards as \nappropriate. For third-class passengers in 1865 we were fortunate to \nhave Chadwick\u2019s direct estimate of their wages. It would not be appro-\npriate, however, simply to index this wage forward. Over the nineteenth \ncentury the cost of third-class travel fell relative to workers\u2019 wages. \nWhereas in 1865 workers could travel only 3.3 miles on an hour\u2019s earn-\nings, in 1912 they could travel 10.4 miles on an hour\u2019s wages. That fall \nin price relative to earnings would have brought train travel into the \nreach of more people, although rail travel was still around three times as \nexpensive relative to earnings as it is today. Even today rail travel is \nused disproportionately by the affluent, so it is again unrealistic to as-\nsume that third-class rail travelers would have been a representative \ncross section of the working class. This conclusion fits with the qualita-\ntive literature that notes that railway travel was not used regularly by all \nsections of the working class.\n79\n That said, the relatively greater afforda-\nbility in 1912 than in 1865 must mean that the difference between the \naverage traveler and the average working-class person was smaller in \n1912 than in 1865. We assume, arbitrarily, that the 1912 premium of \ntravelers\u2019 to average wages was half that of 1865, with a linear trans-\nformation between the two dates.\n80\n This is an important assumption. If \nwe instead assumed that third-class passengers had average working \nclass wages, the estimate of the value of time saved in Table 11 would \nfall by 16 percent, equally, were we to assume that the ratio of third-\nclass to average working-class passengers was as per Chadwick\u2019s ear-\nlier finding, then our estimate would rise by 16 percent. These are not \nsmall error bounds, and reflect the fact that we have little information \non the earnings of those who traveled. \n For years before 1865 we use Chadwick\u2019s wages, indexed via Fein-\nstein\u2019s series; this assumption is less critical given the lower numbers of \nthird-class passengers early on. Table 11 gives the value of the 5 billion \nhours of time saved assuming first that all travel is in work time and \nsecond that none of it is in work time. The estimates range from \u00a3145 \nmillion to \u00a3165 million. As for 1865, neither extreme makes sense, and \n78 Parliamentary Papers: Report from Commissioners: Railways, 1867, vol. 28, part 1, p. liii, \nparagraph 118. \n79 Kellett, Railways, chapter 11, has a good discussion of the means of transport\u2014walking, \nhorse drawn omnibus, tram\u2014used by the working class. \n80 The average English person was taking 26 trips per year by the end of the century: such \nvolumes of travel indicate that travelers were people of at least moderate means.

Again, it is implausible to believe that fewer than \none-quarter or more than three-quarters of premium-class passengers \nwere on business, as such, it is implausible to believe that the correct \nanswer is different to our best guess by more that 3 percent. The exer-\ncise is set out for 1912 in Table 11, and the results for all years are \ngiven in Figure 3. \nMoney Savings \n The miles traveled in each year, the railway fares, and the cost of al-\nternative modes of transport found earlier are sufficient to generate the \nmonetary social savings estimates at different dates, which are given in \nFigure 4. We have assumed that the nature and costs of alternative \nmeans of travel would have remained unaltered. It is possible to claim \nthat the cost of coaching would have risen (greater demand for horses, \ncongestion) or that it would have fallen (economies of scale in coach \nbuilding, better roads), so the assumption of constant prices is reason-\nable.\n Figure 1 showed that passenger miles rose 16-fold between 1850 and \n1912. Despite this, Figure 4 shows that the money social savings rose \nonly sixfold. As Figure 1 shows, most of the rise in passenger miles was \nin third-class travel. Even when we exclude the proportion of third-class \npassengers who would have traveled second class were it to have been \noffered, we still have a large rise in the number of people who would \notherwise have walked. For this group, the money social savings are \nnegative. The increase in fare revenues from third-class passengers \npartly counteracted the additional savings made by first- and second-\nclass passengers, for whom the money cost of travel fell sharply. \n Given that we have imposed a linear fall in the price of tickets be-\ntween 1865 and 1912, we should not place too much confidence in the \npattern of savings between those dates.

It is probably most sensible to see \nsocial savings rising to 2.5 percent in the early 1850s, and remaining in \nthat region for the next 50 years. \nThe Changing Nature and Composition of Social Savings \n Because we now know both the value of time and money savings for \neach year between 1843 and 1912 we can calculate the total social sav-\ning generated by railways in England and Wales. The three series\u2014 \ntime, money, and total\u2014are given in Figure 5. The value of time is \nbased on the earlier plausible assumption that half of premium travel \nwas on business. From 1.5 percent in the early 1840s, the total social \nsaving grew rapidly to reach 4.5 percent by the mid-1850s, before \ngrowing reasonably steadily to reach almost 14 percent by 1912. Fig-\nure 5 also shows that monetary savings became relatively less important \nover time, accounting for around two-thirds of the total social saving in \nthe 1840s, falling back to a quarter or below from the mid-1880s on-\nwards.

Railways also represent a \nreasonably steady proportion of (cumulative) TFP growth throughout \nthe period, at around 15 percent. There is no evidence of relative under-\nperformance of British railways productivity growth as the period pro-\ngressed.\n We noted earlier that the social saving overstates the rise in consumer \nsurplus. If travel costs had been as high in 1912 as they were before \nrailways then far fewer people would have traveled. We set out the for-\nmula to convert social savings into consumer surplus above, along with \nour reasons for preferring unitary elasticity. On that basis we calculate \nthe consumer surplus for each year in our period. As Figure 6 shows, \nconsumer surplus rose steadily, albeit at a slower rate than social sav-\nings. The growing divergence reflects the falls in the (generalized) cost \nof traveling by train: a larger proportion of journeys in 1912 were in-\nduced by lower prices than was true earlier in the period when travel \nwas slower and fares were higher. A higher proportion of rail journeys \ntowards the end of the period would thus not have been undertaken \nwithout railways: these induced journeys are included in social savings, \nbut excluded from consumer surplus. Nevertheless, consumer surplus \nrises steadily from 1 percent in 1843 to more than 6 percent in 1912. \n-30\n-20\n-10\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n1840 1850 1860 1870 1880 1890 1900 1910\n-1.5\n-1.0\n-0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\n3.5\n%\n E\nn\ng\nla\nn\nd\n a\nn\nd\n W\nal\nes\n G\nD\nP\n\u00a3m total\n\u00a3m 3rd class\n% E&W GDP\n\u00a3\n m\nil\nli\no\nn\n \n%\n E\nn\ng\nla\nn\nd\n a\nn\nd\n W\nal\nes\n G\nD\nP\n\u00a3\n m\nil\nli\no\nn\n \nTime is Money 665 \nFIGURE 5\nTHE SOCIAL SAVINGS FROM PASSENGER RAILWAYS, 1843\u20131912 \nSources: Figures 3 and 4 \n As Figure 5 showed, the ratio of money to total savings fell over \ntime, from three-quarters at the beginning, to one-half in 1866, to one-\nquarter in 1883, after which it stabilized at between 20 and 25 percent \nuntil 1912. The rise in the importance of time relative to money savings \nreflects the changing nature of the railway in this period. Initially rail-\nway companies saw the railway as an alternative to coaching, and of-\nfered services that were priced and structured accordingly. But from \n1870 onwards, railways became an ever more mass market commodity, \nwhereby train companies often aimed to make a profit by conveying \nmany people, relatively cheaply, at high load factors. We can see this \ntransition in Figure 7, which gives the percentage of total social savings \nthat went to premium-class travelers. This shift towards mass transport \nmay have been a peculiarly British phenomenon; we know that railway \npenetration was much less extensive in other countries.\n81\n81 For example, whereas England had 26.5 journeys per capita in the mid 1890s, the figure for \nFrance was 9.1, lower than the level reached in England in 1864. France was low even by conti-\nnental standards, but nonetheless Denmark, Prussia, Netherlands, Saxony, Sweden, and Switzer-\nland all lagged significantly behind England in the number of journeys per head, and thus, almost \ncertainly, in the proportion of people who traveled by train at some point.

Over time, however, third class became a larger \nshare of total travel, and the rise in speed and fall in prices increased the \ngain per mile for third-class passengers. As such, the premium passen-\ngers\u2019 share of gains fell steadily to around one-half from the mid-1890s \nonwards. When, however, we look at the two different types of saving, \nvery different pictures emerge. The premium-class passengers always \ngain more than 100 percent of the monetary social saving, because for \nthird-class passengers the railways are more expensive than the alterna-\ntive. But for time savings the position is very different. Not withstand-\ning that premium passengers\u2019 time is valued much more highly per \nhour, the share of the value of time saved by premium passengers fell \nsharply from three-fifths in 1843 to around two-fifths by 1850, followed \nby a steadier decline to one-sixth by 1885, after which it stabilized. \n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n1840 1850 1860 1870 1880 1890 1900 1910\n%\n E\nn\ng\nla\nn\nd\n &\n W\nal\nes\n G\nD\nP\n0.00\n0.10\n0.20\n0.30\n0.40\n0.50\n0.60\n0.70\nra\nti\no\nSocial saving\nConsumer surplus\nRatio\nTime is Money 667 \nFIGURE 7\nPROPORTION OF SOCIAL SAVINGS ACCRUING TO PREMIUM CLASS PASSENGERS \nSources: Figures 3, 4, and 5. \n This pattern fits with what we know about technological adoption. In \nthe initial period, new technology is used in the same way as the previous \ntechnology. In this case, railways were used to carry the well-to-do in \ncomfort, while conditions for those in the third class were very poor, both \nin terms of comfort and convenience.\n82\n Only from 1870 did the railways, \nin part under pressure from legislation, and in part under the implicit \nthreat of nationalization, appreciate the potential of third-class travel, and \noffer better conditions, greater frequency, and lower fares. Economies of \nscale, in terms of adding extra carriages to services, and extra services to \nroutes were the economically sensible strategy in a high fixed cost envi-\nronment. At that point trains became a \u201cnew good\u201d for many. Whereas \nbefore many people could not have realistically expected to travel at all, \ngiven prohibitive coaching costs, and the high cost of walking in terms of \ntime out of the labor market, they could now travel, and they did. As \nsuch, social savings and to a lesser extent consumer surplus increased as \na share of GDP, as did the share that came from time saved, and the share \nthat went to those new travelers in third class. \n82 Bagwell, Transport Revolution, pp. 107\u201310. \n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n1840 1850 1860 1870 1880 1890 1900 1910\nP\ner\nce\nn\nta\ng\ne Money\nTotal\nTime\n668 Leunig\n This continued increase in the value of railways to society long after \ntheir invention and adoption fits with what we know about other so-\ncalled \u201cgeneral purpose technologies.\u201d Paul David has shown how ini-\ntially electricity had only limited effects on business: it was only when \nfactories reorganized production to take account of the possibility of \nunit drives that the productivity revolution occurred.\n83\n The same intui-\ntion underlies the Solow productivity paradox, that we could see com-\nputers everywhere except in the productivity numbers. In the railway \ncase it was only when train companies realized that the best use of rail-\nways was for mass transport, including high load factor commuting and \nexcursion traffic, that society was able to reap the full benefits. It is an \nopen question as to whether the time lag between the railway\u2019s inven-\ntion and its use as a mass transit system was caused by technological \nbottlenecks, such as inadequate engine power limiting train lengths, or \nby a significant entrepreneurial failure on the part of railway managers, \nwho failed to see a new market until surprisingly late. \n There is another way in which these findings fit well with the more \ngeneral literature on technology. William Nordhaus has shown that, on \naverage, postwar American entrepreneurs in the nonfarm sector cap-\ntured only 2.2 percent of the total benefit to society from new inven-\ntions. The remaining 97.8 percent went to consumers as additional con-\nsumer surplus.\n84\n Tony Arnold and Sean McCartney have recently \ncompiled data on the return on capital employed for U.K. railways. \nThey conclude that although returns were initially reasonable, \u201cFrom \nthat date [1872], however, through to the outbreak of war in 1914, the \nindustry\u2019s results, and the returns it was able to provide to its investors, \nwere consistently disappointing.\u201d\n85\n Although it is not possible to di-\nrectly compare the percentage rate of return on capital employed with \nthe estimates of social savings or consumer surplus presented here, it is \nclear that ex-post average returns of under 4 percent on capital em-\nployed imply little if any monopoly power, and were far smaller in ab-\nsolute terms than the average consumer surplus of 3.7 percent of GDP \nover the same period. \nCONCLUSIONS \n This article makes a number of contributions. It has calibrated the rise \nin train speeds prior to 1912, and used those results to assess the addi-\ntional amount of time that it would have taken to undertake all railway \n83 David, \u201cComputer and Dynamo.\u201d \n84 Nordhaus, \u201cSchumpeterian Profits.\u201d \n85 Arnold and McCartney, \u201cRates of Return,\u201d pp. 54\u201355. \nTime is Money 669 \njourneys without railways. The numbers are large, and increased rapidly \nover time: growing tenfold from the mid-1840s to the mid-1860s, and \nthen tenfold again by the outbreak of the First World War, at which \npoint it would have taken an additional five billion hours to undertake \nall rail journeys without them, using the means of transport that passen-\ngers would have chosen in the absence of railways. Trains were much \nfaster than coaches or walking, and became faster over time, with aver-\nage speeds rising from 20 to 28 miles an hour between 1850 and 1910, \nor 37 miles an hour on more important routes. Although initially less \nimportant than the money savings offered by railways, the value of time \nsaved became as important in the 1860s, and considerably more impor-\ntant thereafter. By the mid-1880s, time savings outweighed money sav-\nings by a factor of five. \n The social savings from railways, in time and money, amounted to \nsome 2 percent of GDP as early as 1850, to 5 percent of GDP by 1865, \n10 percent by the end of the century, and fully 14 percent by 1912. Even \nwhen we use the consumer surplus estimate the gains are significant. At \nthe most plausible price elasticity assumption of 1 percent, the con-\nsumer surplus benefit from railways represented 6 percent of national \nincome in 1912. \n These savings are significant relative to those available from other \nsources in the nineteenth century. Including the value of time saved by \npassenger railways increases the total level of TFP growth in the econ-\nomy by 9 percent, with passenger railways alone accounting for around \n15 percent of total TFP growth in the pre-1913 railway era. They were \nthus a major contributor to aggregate productivity growth in this era. \n Railways represented a dramatic change in transport technology. The \ncost of travel fell significantly, and its speed and comfort rose dramati-\ncally. This is particularly true from the 1870s onwards, as railways \nsought to attract more customers with better third-class services. People \nwho could never have expected to travel at all in their lives were able to \ndo so for the first time. And those who did travel were able to do so \nmore often. This article does not claim to measure all of the benefits of \nrailways to travelers, let alone to the economy or society as a whole. \nBut it does claim to have calculated the social savings and consumer \nsurplus of passenger railways. Those figures show that the contribution \nof railways relative to national income continued to rise over in the Vic-\ntorian and Edwardian eras, as rail companies discovered new and better \nways to make this technology valuable to society. As the period pro-\ngressed railways offered poor returns to investors, but they delivered \ntremendous welfare gains to travelers and to society. \n670 Leunig\nAppendix\n50 IMPORTANT ROUTES \nBirmingham-Dudley, Leeds-Bradford, Liverpool-Birmingham, Liverpool-Leeds, \nLiverpool-Preston, Liverpool-Sheffield, London-Bath, London-Birmingham, London-\nBradford, London-Brighton, London-Bristol, London-Cambridge, London-Canterbury,\nLondon-Cardiff, London-Chatham, London-Colchester, London-Coventry, London-\nDerby, London-Dover, London-Hull, London-Ipswich, London-Leeds, London-\nLeicester, London-Liverpool, London-Maidstone, London-Manchester, London-\nNewcastle, London-Northampton, London-Norwich, London-Nottingham, London-\nOldham, London-Oxford, London-Plymouth, London-Portsmouth, London-Preston, \nLondon-Reading, London-Sheffield, London-Southampton, London-Wolverhampton, \nManchester-Birmingham, Manchester-Blackburn, Manchester-Bolton, Manchester-\nBradford, Manchester-Leeds, Manchester-Liverpool, Manchester-Macclesfield, Man-\nchester-Oldham, Manchester-Preston, Manchester-Sheffield, Manchester-Stockport \n222 TOWNS AT WHICH MINOR JOURNEYS ENDED \nAbergavenny, Alderley Edge, Alfreton, Altrincham, Andover, Ashford, Ashton-\nunder-Lyne, Barnsley, Barnstaple, Barrow, Barry, Basingstoke, Bath, Bedford, Ber-\nwick, Beverley, Birkenhead, Birmingham, Blackburn, Blackpool, Blyth, Bolton, \nBournemouth, Bradford, Bridgnorth, Bridgwater, Bridlington, Brighton, Bristol, \nBromsgrove, Burnley, Burslem, Burton on Trent, Bury, Buxton, Cambridge, Cardiff, \nCarlisle, Carnarvon, Castleford, Caterham, Chatham, Chelmsford, Cheltenham, Chert-\nsey, Chester, Chesterfield, Chichester, Chorley, Cirencester, Clevedon, Coalville, Col-\nchester, Colne, Colwyn Bay, Conway, Coventry, Cowes, Crewe, Darlington, Dartford, \nDartmouth, Darwen, Denton, Derby, Dewsbury, Doncaster, Dorchester, Dover, Drif-\nfield, Dudley, East Grinstead, Eastbourne, Eccles, Exeter, Felixstowe, Fleetwood, \nFolkestone, Garston, Gateshead, Glossop, Gloucester, Grantham, Gravesend, \nGrimsby, Halifax, Hanley, Harrogate, Hartlepool, Hastings, Hereford, Heywood, \nHinckley, Huddersfield, Hyde, Ilkeston, Ipswich, Jarrow, Keighley, Keswick, Kette-\nring, Kidderminster, Kings Lynn, Kingston upon Hull, Kingswood, Kirkby Lonsdale, \nLancaster, Leamington, Leeds, Leek, Leicester, Leigh, Leighton Buzzard, Lewes, Ley-\nland, Lichfield, Lincoln, Liverpool, Llandudno, Llanelly, London, Long Eaton, Long-\nton, Loughborough, Lowestoft, Luton, Lyme Regis, Macclesfield, Maidstone, Mal-\nvern, Manchester, Mansfield, Margate, Merthyr Tydfil, Middlesbrough, Middleton, \nMirfield, Nantwich, Newark, Newcastle, Newcastle under Lyme, Newmarket, New-\nport, North Shields, Northampton, Northwich, Norwich, Nottingham, Nuneaton, Old-\nham, Oxford, Padiham, Peterborough, Plymouth, Pontypool, Pontypridd, Portsmouth, \nPreston, Radcliffe, Ramsgate, Reading, Reigate, Rochdale, Rochester, Rodwell, Roth-\nerham, Rugby, Runcorn, Sale, Scarborough, Seaford, Selby, Sheffield, Shipley, \nShrewsbury, Sleaford, Smethwick, South Shields, Southampton, Southport, Sowerby \nBridge, St Annes, St Helens, St. Albans, St. Austell, Stafford, Stalybridge, Stockport, \nStockton-on-Tees, Stoke on Trent, Stroud, Sunderland, Sutton Coldfield, Tamworth, \nTaunton, Tewkesbury, Torquay, Tredegar, Tunbridge Wells, Tunstall, Ulverston, \nWakefield, Wallasey, Wallsend, Walsall, Warrington, Warwick, Watford, Welling-\nborough, West Bromwich, Weston super Mare, Widnes, Wigan, Wilmslow, Winder-\nmere, Wisbech, Woking, Wolverhampton, Worcester, Wrexham, Yarmouth, York \nTime is Money 671 \nREFERENCES\nPrimary Sources \nThe Railway Returns data were taken from the following issue of Parliamentary Pa-\npers, some of which give data for more than one year. \n1850 52, 1851 51, 1852 48, 1854 62, 1854-5 48, 1856 54, 1857 38, 1859 25, 1859 \nsess 2 27, 1860 61, 1862 53, 1863 57, 1864 53, 1865 49, 1866 63, 1867 62, 1867-\n8 62, 1868-9 54, 1870 59, 1873 57, 1876 65, 1883 60, 1884 69, 1885 68, 1886 \n58, 1887 72, 1888 89, 1889 68, 1890 65, 1891 75, 1892 70, 1893-4 79, 1894 75, \n1895 86, 1896 74, 1897 77, 1898 81, 1899 85, 1909 76, 1910 79, 1911 70, 1912-\n3 75, 1913 58. \nOther Parliamentary Papers:\n1837, vol. 20, report from the Select Committee on Internal communication taxation \n1840, vol. 13, Reports from Committees: Railways \n1867, vol. 38, part 1, p. 53, Report from Commissioners: Railways \nThe Times: Issue 5,198, 29 August 1801; Issue 5,202, 3 September 1801; Issue 5,400, \n26 April 1802; Issue 7,246, 1 January 1808; Issue 9,008, 6 September 1813; Issue \n8,343, 17 October 1814; Issue 9,450, 21 February 1815; Issue 11,152, 24 January \n1821; Issue 11,217, 11 April 1821; Issue 11,570, 29 May, 1822; Issue 11,598, 01 \nJuly 1822; Issue 11,822, 18 March 1823; and Issue 11,873, 16 May 1823. \nSecondary Sources \nAcworth, W.
