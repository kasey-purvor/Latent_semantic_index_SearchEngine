The precautionary principle is \nlikely to be adopted by regulators, so it is important that the effects of acute and \nchronic exposures of ecosystems to CO2 leakages are evaluated.  Consequently, \nexisting regulations are likely to be developed to include specific recommendations \nconcerning leakages.  This review shows that much basic data simply do not exist to \nassist regulators in this process.   \n \nKey words: Carbon dioxide, Geological storage, Ecosystems, Environment, \nRegulators,  \n \n 3 \nIntroduction  \n \nIt is now widely recognised that increasing CO2 emissions will lead to anthropogenic \nclimate change and ocean acidification, which would have severe consequences for \necosystems and for sustainability of human society (International Panel on Climate \nChange (IPCC Third Assessment Report)).  However, most economies are heavily \ndependent on the CO2-emitting use of fossil fuels and worldwide strategies are now \nbeing sought to reduce such emissions.  One potential technology is the geological \nstorage of CO2 (Holloway et al, 1997).  The European Emissions Trading Scheme \nrecognises that geological storage could be a valid mitigation option and the IPCC \nalso recognises that CO2 storage may be a viable option for bridging the gap to a more \ndiverse energy economy (eg through generation of hydrogen from fossil \nfuels\/biomass, renewables etc).  \n \nTo date, the major projects demonstrating CO2 capture and storage (CCS) at \nWeyburn, Canada (Wilson and Monea, 2004) and Sleipner, in the North Sea (Torp \nand Gale, 2002) have focussed on technological and economic viability, and whether \nsites could leak.  Consequently, these studies are focussing on monitoring, verification \nand risk assessment \u2013 it is intended that such work will assist regulators and reassure \nother stakeholder groups (especially the public) that the sites will not leak.  These \nprojects all operate within existing oil and gas regulatory frameworks.  At Weyburn, \nfor example, injection of CO2 is used to enhance oil recovery from an existing oil \nfield.  However, if CCS is conducted outside hydrocarbon-related operations these \nexisting regulations may not apply, especially in Europe.   At national, European \n(Energy outlook to 2020) and international level (IPCC TAR) the potential \n 4 \nenvironmental impacts of uncontrolled CO2 releases have been highlighted to be of \nparticular significance for regulators.  Thus a new regulatory framework may be \nneeded.  The development of these regulations will involve national and European \nbodies, and will take account of current international and European legislation and its \nnational implementation.  Additionally, studies on public perception of CCS \n(Shackley, 2004) consistently indicate concerns about the effect of leakages on the \nenvironment.   \n \nIt can be assumed that storage sites would be selected to minimise the potential for \nleakage. However, if leakages from storage sites did occur, they could be over small \nareas from discrete point sources, such as abandoned wells and, consequently, they \ncould result in high concentrations of CO2 - this could reach tens of percent levels in \nsoil gas, well above any background levels.  Uncontrolled leakages would have \nwidespread implications for the environment.  In economic terms, leaks into marine \nand freshwater systems might affect fisheries.  For terrestrial systems, leakages might \ndamage crops, groundwater quality and\/or human and animal health.  Other concerns \ninclude acidification, changes in biological diversity and species composition, and \nasphyxiation at high CO2 concentrations.  In addition, biogeochemical processes may \nbe affected as increased CO2 concentrations could change pH, microbial populations \nand nutrient supply.  It is also important to understand the local effects in comparison \nto global increases on the environment and habitats.  In contrast to studies of the \neffects of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations (say a rise from current levels to \n550ppm), levels of CO2 in soils resulting from CO2 leaks from engineered CO2 \nstorage sites underground could be several orders of magnitude above atmospheric \nlevels.  It is also important to consider the importance of potential environmental \n 5 \nimpacts resulting from impurities (such as H2S, SO2 and NOx) that may be present in \nleaking CO2.  Thus the potential effects of such leakages ought to be evaluated both to \nprovide information for a developing regulatory framework and to provide input into \nthe development of a safety case methodology necessary to build confidence in the \ndecision-making.   \n \nThis paper seeks to give a brief overview of existing data on the potential effects of \nleakages, particularly of CO2, on ecosystems.  It attempts to identify the gaps that \nshould be addressed to inform stakeholders particularly in the European context.  \nLeakage is here defined as the transfer of CO2 back to the readily accessible near-\nsurface, surface and atmosphere following injection into a deep geological reservoir.   \n \nThe Regulatory Context for Geological Storage \n \nAlthough a detailed and specific regulatory framework for CCS (e.g. Stenhouse et al, \n2004), and indeed the interpretation of existing international environmental law, is \ncurrently under discussion at national and regional (European) levels, it is worth \nnoting that any regulations will have to fit within pre-existing broader regulatory \nframeworks.  Internationally, the most important regulation for offshore geological \nstorage is the broad framework of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the \nSea, which provides the \u201cglobal rules and standards\u201d that subsequent, more detailed \nregional and national laws are based upon.  The Convention on the Prevention of \nMarine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter (1972) and its later 1996 \nProtocol, known as the \u2018London Convention\u2019, provide a clear definition of the \nimplementation of the principles set out in the UN Law of the Sea.  At the regional \n 6 \nlevel, the OSPAR Convention is the regional agreement of Western European \nsignatories which, although similar to the Law of the Sea and the London Convention, \nis wider in scope and includes additional forms of waste. \n \nIn practice, the OSPAR Convention takes precedence over the London Convention \nand the UN Law of the Sea for Contracting Parties.  In contrast, however, to the Law \nof the Sea and partly to the London Convention, the OSPAR Convention specifically \nand explicitly provides legally binding status to the precautionary principle and the \npolluter pays principle: \n \nOSPAR Convention Article 2(2)a \u201cthe precautionary principle, by virtue of which preventive \nmeasures are to be taken when there are reasonable grounds for concern that substances or \nenergy introduced, directly or indirectly, into the marine environment may bring about \nhazards to human health, harm living resources and marine ecosystems, damage amenities or \ninterfere with other legitimate uses of the sea, even when there is no conclusive evidence of a \ncausal relationship between the inputs and the effects;\u201d \n \nThe OSPAR Convention\u2019s approach to the precautionary principle is proactive and \npositively requires preventative measures to be taken when there is reasonable \napprehension of a hazard. In addition the possibility of damage does not have to be \nserious or irreversible: \n \n\u201cArticle 3 of the 1996 Protocol states that in implementing this protocol, contracting parties \nshall apply a precautionary approach to environmental protection from dumping of wastes \nor other matter whereby appropriate preventative measures are taken where there is \nreason to believe that wastes or other matter introduced into the marine environment are \n 7 \nlikely to cause harm even where there is no conclusive evidence to prove a causal relation \nbetween inputs and their harm effects.\u201d (Purdy and Macrory, 2003) \n \nThis paper is primarily concerned with identifying the information\/knowledge needs \nof regulators for CCS and assumes that, as recent discussions have implied (e.g. \nOSPAR meeting, Trondheim, October 2004), it will be shown that geological storage \noffshore is sufficiently safe (through national\/European safety cases) that the \napplication of the precautionary principle will allow it to take place under the OSPAR \nConvention.  Nevertheless, the application of the precautionary principle, among \nother European directives, will still require a demonstration of the safety of geological \nstorage at a given site. Hence, unless it can be shown that CO2 will not leak from the \nreservoir, or if it did, that the potential impacts would be tolerable, the application of \nthe precautionary principle would prohibit CCS under the OSPAR Convention. \n \nCO2 is not explicitly listed as a waste in the London Convention (Purdy and Macrory, \n2003).  The question of whether CO2 should be considered to be a waste has recently \nbeen debated among consultative parties to both the London and OSPAR \nConventions, but no consensus was reached.    The group of Jurist and Linguists of \nthe OSPAR Commission evaluated the placement of CO2 in the maritime area.  They \nconcluded that the placement of land-derived CO2 via pipelines, in formations deep \nbelow the seabed, for the purposes of enhanced hydrocarbon recovery or for \nmitigating climate change, are not prohibited by the OPSAR Convention, though \nsubject to strict authorisation or regulation (OSPAR 04\/23\/1-E, Annex 12).  The \nexceptions to this are if CO2 were to be defined as an industrial waste, geological \nstorage via an offshore installation, vessel or from a structure in the maritime area that \nis neither part of a pipeline system nor an offshore installation (classified as \n 8 \n\u2018dumping\u2019), would be prohibited.  The interpretation of the legality, or otherwise, of \nthe various methods of transporting and injecting CO2 in deep geological structures \nbelow the seabed remains open and the Biodiversity Committee is currently \nconsidering how CCS relates to the OSPAR convention. \n \nIn Europe, several additional laws, known as \u2018Directives\u2019, provide a further regulatory \nframework for storage projects (inter alia):  \n\u2022 the Environmental Impact Assessment (85\/337\/EEC, subsequently \namended by 97\/11\/EC) \n\u2022 Strategic Environmental Assessment directives (2001\/42\/EC) \n\u2022 the Environmental Liability Directive (2004\/35\/EC) which came into force \non April 21, 2004 and must be implemented by member states by 2007   \n\u2022 the Directive establishing a framework for Community action in the field \nof water policy \u2013 the water directive (2000\/60\/EC). Some aspects of this \ndirective may be pertinent to geological storage \n\u2022 The Directive on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and \nflora (92\/43\/EEC). \n \nThe Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) requires that the environmental \nconsequences of projects are assessed before authorisation is given.  CCS projects are \nnot explicitly referred to in the EIA directive, although it can be argued that they \nwould be included in \u2018Annex II\u2019 projects, because of their size, location and potential \nimpacts.  If an EIA is required, the statement should include information on the direct \nand indirect effects of a project on a variety of factors, including human beings, fauna, \nflora and the environment. \n 9 \n \nThe Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Directive, requires authorities \npreparing any plan or programme, to evaluate the potential environmental impacts at \nan earlier and broader, strategic level.  This may be considered as providing the legal \nrequirement of a national or European \u2018safety case\u2019, as has been published for several \nnational radioactive waste programmes.  This Directive came into force in 2001 and is \nmandatory for governments.  Sweden has now implemented the Directive and the UK \ngovernment is undertaking SEAs in a number of related industries (e.g. hydrocarbon \nexploration and production). \n \nThe Environmental Liability Directive defines the remit and nature of liabilities for \noperators under the \u2018polluter pays\u2019 principle.  Offshore and coastal marine habitats, as \ndefined in the \u2018Water\u2019 and \u2018Habitats\u2019 directives, are included.  \n \nThe UK government has also ratified several international conventions that protect \nhabitats:  \n\u2022 the Biodiversity Convention (1992); \n\u2022 the Jakarta Mandate on Marine and Coastal Biological Diversity; \n\u2022 the Bergen Ministerial Convention (concerned with balancing uses and \nconservation in the North Sea); \n\u2022 Annex V of the OSPAR Convention addresses protection of marine \nbiodiversity and ecosystems. \n \n 10 \nThese imply that the potential impacts of geological storage on the marine \nenvironment will need to be assessed.  In addition the European Habitats Directive \nrequires identification of habitats and species that should be preserved and restored.   \n \nEffects of CO2 leakages on the environment  \n \nConcentrations and fluxes of CO2 in natural \u2018baseline\u2019 environments and in sites \nwhere CO2 leakages are occurring naturally vary over a wide range, as shown in Table \n1.  The fluxes quoted are, however, difficult to compare because a spatial term of \nreference is often not given (e.g. 4.2 x 109 mol y-1 for the \u2018Albani Hills\u2019 (Chiodini and \nFrondii, 2001)).  Nevertheless, concentrations can vary, for example, from <0.1% to \n~95% of the total gas in soils and up to 95% CO2 of the total gas from natural marine \nseepages.  The high concentrations are generally associated with point sources (e.g. \nvolcanic areas).  It is difficult to compare these concentrations and fluxes with those \nthat could arise from a CO2 storage site.  However, risk studies for land-based sites \nhave estimated a cumulative probability of a leak from a reservoir over a 1000 year \ndesign lifetime of 0.34 (i.e. 34% probability of one leak in 1000 years) with the \naverage size being 0.2% of the amount stored (Turley et al, 2004 based on DNV \nanalysis).  For the calculated storage capacity for the oil and gas fields in the entire \nNorth Sea of 30Gt of CO2 (Chadwick et al. 2004), a 0.2% leakage would give a loss \nof 6x107 t CO2 (60 Mt) over 1000 y (6x104 y-1).  With a cumulative probability of \n34%, approximately 20 Mt of CO2 potentially could be leaked over 1000 years.   \nHowever, extreme caution should be given to these estimates as the magnitude of \nleakages and the likelihood of their occurrence will be site-specific.  There is clearly a \n 11 \nneed for more research before profiles for geological reservoirs can be more \nrealistically evaluated. \n \nAlthough extensive physiological research is available, the environmental impacts of \nelevated CO2 (whether through slow or catastrophic release) on terrestrial, subsurface \nand marine ecosystems are poorly understood.  Essentially, respiratory physiology \nand pH control are the primary physiological mechanisms controlling responses in \norganisms to elevated CO2 exposures.  Information is available from a diverse \nresearch base including physiology, food preservation and botany, and some examples \nare given in Table 2.  These data, however, are mostly from studies on organisms \nexposed to either slightly elevated concentrations of CO2 or the high concentrations \nthat give a lethal response.   Plant responses near natural springs (e.g. Raschi et al, \n1997) and at Mammoth Mountain in USA (Hepple, 2004) have been examined but \nthere are very few studies on entire ecosystems with long-term exposure to chronic \nCO2 concentrations (below about 10%).  There are no known studies on the effects of \nelevated CO2 on subsurface microbial populations.  In marine environments, \nexperiments have been attempted to examine chronic exposure of CO2 on deep-sea \norganisms (e.g. Shirayama, 1997; 2002).  Yamada and Ikeda (1999) also indicate that \ntolerance to pH can vary in the pelagic stages of some species.  Additionally, it is \nrecognised that pH changes caused by increased CO2 concentrations will have effects \non calcifying organisms such as coccolithophores and corals, but it is not clear how \nthis will influence the overall ecosystem (Turley et al. 2004).  Studies on human \nvolunteers exist and the medical consequences of exposure are well documented, \nalthough it should be noted that only healthy subjects were used.  However, once \n 12 \nagain, no long-term epidemiological studies have been carried out to study the effects \nof long-term chronic exposure to CO2 on large populations.   \n \nOrganisms close to a leakage could be exposed to acute and perhaps lethal \nconcentrations whilst those at increasing distances from the leakage could be exposed \nto firstly acute and then to chronic concentrations.  How such exposures will influence \nan existing ecosystem as a whole, or the individual species within an ecosystem is \nunknown.  Thus for all ecosystems of interest, the potential indicator groups at the \ndifferent trophic levels need to be identified and effects determined.  It is likely that \nparticular concern will lie with certain key receptors.  For example, in marine \nenvironments key fishery groups and their food sources may be specific target \nreceptors, whilst in terrestrial systems these may include humans and crop plants.  \nHowever, such key receptor groups should not be seen in isolation as they will \ninteract with other species within an ecosystem and these may be more or less tolerant \nto CO2 exposure.   \n \nSummary of Gaps in information \n \nThis paper has highlighted the gaps in information necessary to assess the potential \nimpacts of CO2 leakages on marine, terrestrial and subsurface ecosystems.  These can \nbe summarised as follows: \n \n1. There appears to be no explicit acknowledgement or guidance in existing \nEuropean and UK habitat and water regulations on the release of CO2 from \nstorage sites.  No target species are identified and no limits at which any \n 13 \nspecies becomes intolerant to CO2 are given. No environmental criteria for \nCCS have been defined.  These will be needed in risk assessments and \nenvironmental impact assessments.  \n2. There are no data on long term, low-level exposure of CO2 on any marine, \nterrestrial or subsurface ecosystem and few on any single or potential target \nspecies.  There are no data on recovery rates following exposure to chronic or \nacute exposure to CO2 leakages. \n3. Tools to monitor impacts on target organisms in all environments need to be \ndeveloped.  These tools need to be pervasive and responsive to changes in \necosystems.  They should also be tailored to the different challenges to be \nfound in marine, terrestrial and subsurface environments. \n4. Marine environments are likely to be a top priority in North Western Europe \nand information from key commercial fisheries is particularly crucial.  Other \nkey indicator species will need to be identified. \n5. Confidence in risk assessments will be increased if biogeochemical processes \nand their effects can be satisfactorily represented.   \n \nWays forward \n \nTo date, most CCS projects have operated within existing oil and gas regulatory \nframeworks, which may not apply if other non-hydrocarbon and associated reservoir \ngeological formations are used.  Thus a new regulatory framework may be needed and \nat national, European and international levels the potential environmental impacts of \nuncontrolled CO2 leakages have been highlighted to be of particular concern to \nregulators.  Existing regulations are likely to be developed and altered to include \n 14 \nspecific recommendations concerning leakages and it is clear from this review that \nmuch basic data simply do not exist to assist regulators in this process.  The \nprecautionary principle is likely to be adopted by regulators, so it is important that the \neffects of both acute and chronic exposures of CO2 leakages are evaluated on \necosystems.  This can be achieved by adopting two approaches:  \n \n1. Total environmental response evaluations using existing natural leakages \nto investigate responses; \n2. Controlled long-term exposure experiments using key terrestrial and \nmarine functional species.  This would include organisms from different \ntrophic levels including crop plants and commercial fish. \n \nSuch knowledge will provide CO2 limits for regulators, provide information on \nrecovery rates of organisms to chronic exposure and help to refine risk assessments.  \nThey will also help to develop and determine the most effective tools and methods to \ndetermine and assess ecosystem changes for future CCS sites. \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nOur thanks to Dr Chris Rochelle for his helpful comments on the tables for this paper \nand for access to his considerable literature database.
