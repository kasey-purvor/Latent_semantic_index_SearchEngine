INTRODUCTION \n \nIn the analysis of structural dynamics, accurate modal prediction is essential. For a \npractical structure of large size and complex configuration, however, modal errors due to \nsimplification of structural modelling and poor estimation of structural parameters are \nalmost inevitable. Poor analytical modelling may also occur if undetected damage (fault) \nexists in a structure causing overestimation of analytical stiffness in the local region. In \norder to improve the structural model efficiently, various methods based on available \nmodal information from vibration test have been developed in the last two decades. \nIn the development of those methods, it has been noted that the major difficulty \ntowards achieving the correct and unique solution is caused by the insufficiency \n(incompletion) of test modes. One type of the methods early developed to tackle this \nproblem was proposed by Baruch [1], Berman and Nagy [2, 3], and was based on an \noptimal method, e.g. the Lagrange multiplier method. These methods have the advantage \nof simple and non-iterative model updating procedure and accurate matching of the \npredicted modes with measured modes. However these methods make the original system \nmatrices reconstructed without preserving their physical meaning of element connection. \nConsequently the reconstructed model would not guarantee the modal correction beyond \nthe range of measured modes. \nThe second type of developed methods includes the two-response method [4], the \northogonality and eigendata constraint methods [5], and the extended corrected modal \n 2\nconstraint method [6]. Unlike the aforementioned first type of methods, only chosen \nmatrix elements will be adjusted in these methods so that the original configuration of \nsystem matrices will be maintained. In practice however, the success of those methods \nheavily depend upon the accuracy and number of available measured modes. That is a \ncrucial limit of the methods when applied to practical problems. One of the reasons for the \nabove method limitation may be that both the location and magnitudes of the modelling \nerrors in an analytical model need to be identified simultaneously during model updating. \nTo avoid such difficulty, effort has been made to tackle the problem in two steps, i.e. the \nmodelling error localisation followed by model correction. The error magnitudes of poorly \nmodelled elements are not required at the first step of identifying their locations. Hence \nthe conditions required for accurate result can be relaxed. By employing the sensitivity \nmethod for example, which may be classified as the third type of method, the sensitivity of \neigendata errors [7] or orthogonality errors [8] to a small change of individual matrix \nelement can be calculated. A non-zero sensitivity value indicates that the elements located \nin corresponding region may need improvement for accurate modal prediction. In practice \nhowever, not all modelling errors would be necessarily indicated by non-zero sensitivity \nvalues. This is mainly because the limited number of available measured modes may be \ninsensitive to some of the modelling errors. On the other hand, not all non-zero sensitivity \nvalues necessarily represent the actual modelling errors. This is mainly because some \nregions to which the response is sensitive to modelling errors are actually correctly \nmodelled. Normally an iterative performance is required for the model updating to \nconverge. \nBecause of the similarity of poor modelling localisation to structural damage \nlocalisation using modal test data, some methods may be suitable for both applications. In \nthe early 1990s Hearn and Testa [9] used modal strain energy for damage detection in \nstructures. Contribution in developing the method has also been presented by Lim and \nKashangaki [10]. Later further effort has been made to locate the structural damage based \non the ratio of change in the modal strain energy caused by the damage [11]. Although this \ntype of method is effective and may be applied to locating poor modelling, its accuracy of \nresult, especially in the elements adjacent to the damage region, needs further \nimprovement. In order to overcome this drawback, an energy error estimation method has \nbeen proposed and applied to both model improvement [12] and damage localisation [13] \nby Guo and Hemingway. This method is based on estimating the analytical and modal test \ndata based kinetic and strain energies at finite element scale. The differences in magnitude \nrepresent the existing energy errors and indicate poor mass and stiffness modelling or \ninternal structural damage. In terms of modal strain energy calculation, this method is \nsimilar to the aforementioned methods. However, this current method also provides \nadditional measure to distinguish poor modelling or damage regions from those correctly \nmodelled. This makes difference and has the advantage over the previously developed \nsimilar methods. Further more from the estimated energy error, a correction factor for \neach element can be created and used to improve each individual element and hence the \nwhole model. \nIn this present paper, effort has been made to apply the energy error estimation \nmethod to improve the model of a full-scale tail-plane structure. One simulated example \nusing \u2018test\u2019 data and one practical case using measured modes have been demonstrated. In \nboth cases poorly modelled regions of the original structural model have been located \naccurately. Subsequently, significant improvement of the structural model with reduction \nof average frequency error from 2.2% down to 0.1% for the simulated \u2018test\u2019 case and from \n4.6% to 1.8% for the practical case has been achieved.   \n \n 3\n \n2. THE ENERGY ERROR ESTIMATION METHOD \n \n2.1 MODELLING ERRORS INDICATED BY ENERGY ERRORS  \nUsing the finite element method, the stiffness and mass models for a structural \nsystem are normally represented in matrices [K]a and [M]a assembled from element \nmodels [Ki]a and [Mi]a , i.e. \n \n  [ ] [ ]K Ka i a\ni\nn= \u2211\n=1\n and  [ ] [ ]M Ma i a\ni\nn= \u2211\n=1\n  (1) \n \nwhere n represents the total number of elements in the system. \nIn a design process, unacceptable difference may be found between the predicted \nand measured modes of a structural system. In such case, it is usual to suspect that errors \narise from the structural models under the assumption of reliable measured modes. The \ncorrect yet unknown stiffness and mass models, [K]c and [M]c, may be then represented in \nterms of the original stiffness and mass matrices and their error matrices, [\u2206Ki] and [\u2206Mi], \nas follows \n [ ] ([ ] [ ])K K Kc i a\ni\nn\ni= \u2211 +=1 \u2206\n and [ ] ([ ] [ ])M M Mc i a\ni\nn\ni= \u2211 +=1 \u2206\n  (2) \n \nThe modelling errors would cause difference between the analytical and test-data \nbased energies, which are defined here as the strain and kinetic energy errors, \u2206Sj and \u2206Tj, \nof the system as represented below. \n \njti\nn\ni\nai\nT\njtja\nn\ni\nai\nT\njaj KKKS }]){[]([}{2\n1}{][}{\n2\n1\n11\n\u03a6\u2206+\u2211\u03a6\u2212\u03a6\u2211\u03a6=\u2206\n==\n   (3a) \n    jti\nn\ni\nai\nT\njtjtja\nn\ni\nai\nT\njajaj MMMT }]){[]([}{2\n1}{][}{\n2\n1\n11\n\u03a6\u2206+\u2211\u03a6\u2212\u03a6\u2211\u03a6=\u2206\n==\n\u03bb\u03bb  (3b) \n \nwhere \u03bbja and \u03bbjt are the jth analytical and measured eigenvalues, { }\u03a6 ja and { }\u03a6 jt  the jth \nanalytical and test-data based mass-normalised mode shape divided by ja\u03bb2  \nand jt\u03bb2  respectively.

In the initial \nanalysis stage however, [\u2206Ki] and [\u2206Mi] are unknown, hence [K]C and [M]C are normally \nreplaced by [K]a and [M]a. In such case, the system energy errors \u2206Sj and \u2206Tj in a \nparticular mode can be approximated below and become non-zero. \n \nj\nn\ni\nai\nT\njtjt\nn\ni\nai\nT\njtja\nn\ni\nai\nT\njaj KKKS }{][}{)}{][}{}{][}({2\n1\n111\n\u03a6\u2206\u2211\u03a6\u2248\u03a6\u2211\u03a6\u2212\u03a6\u2211\u03a6\u2248\u2206\n===\n      (4a) \n 4\njt\nn\ni\nai\nT\njtjj\nn\ni\nai\nT\njtjt\njt\nn\ni\nai\nT\njtjtja\nn\ni\nai\nT\njajaj\nMM\nMMT\n}{][}{}{][}{\n)}{][}{}{][}{(\n2\n1\n11\n11\n\u03a6\u2211\u03a6\u2206+\u03a6\u2206\u2211\u03a6\u2248\n\u03a6\u2211\u03a6\u2212\u03a6\u2211\u03a6\u2248\u2206\n==\n==\n\u03bb\u03bb\n\u03bb\u03bb\n   (4b) \n \nwhere  \u2206\u03bbj= \u03bbja - \u03bbjt and jtjaj }{}{}{ \u03a6\u2212\u03a6=\u03a6\u2206  represent the frequency and modal errors \nof the jth mode respectively.  \nIt is assumed here that a spatially complete set of measurement is available. In \npractice, analytical values will be employed to make the spatially incomplete measured \nmodes expanded and completed. Equation (4) shows that the system energy errors \u2206Sj and \n\u2206Tj are the sum of element energy errors \u2206Sij and \u2206Tij in a particular mode, which are \nrepresented below. \n \n      jai\nT\njtij KS }{][}{ \u03a6\u2206\u03a6\u2248\u2206      (5a) \njtai\nT\njtjjai\nT\njtjtij MMT }{][}{}{][}{ \u03a6\u03a6\u2206+\u03a6\u2206\u03a6\u2248\u2206 \u03bb\u03bb   (5b) \n \nFor those correctly modelled elements, [\u2206Ki] and [\u2206Mi] don\u2019t exist and hence equation (5) \ngives accurate representation of their energy errors. Those energy errors may not be zero \nbut small values due to modal error caused by poorly modelled elements elsewhere. \nOppositely, large energy error values normally arise from those poorly modelled elements \nassociated with [\u2206Ki] and [\u2206Mi]. As more test modes are available and used, these element \nenergy error values will be further increased and their difference from the correctly \nmodelled elements will be further enlarged. The element energy errors in m number of test \nmodes are represented as follows: \n \n \u2211 \u03a6\u2206\u03a6=\u2206\n=\nm\nj\njai\nT\njti KS\n1\n}{][}{     (6a) \n)}{][}{}{][}{(\n1\njtai\nT\njtjjai\nT\njtjt\nm\nj\ni MMT \u03a6\u03a6\u2206+\u03a6\u2206\u03a6\u2211=\u2206 = \u03bb\u03bb  (6b) \n \nEnergy errors are thus used to indicate the possibility, or degree of, element modelling \nerrors. \n \n2.2  LOCALIZATION OF POORLY MODELLED ELEMENTS \n \n2.2.1 Initial Localization   \nAccording to equations (5) and (6), the total strain and kinetic energy errors of a \nsystem modelled by using \u2018n\u2019 number of elements can be estimated by using \u2018m\u2019 number \nof modes as follows: \n \u2211 \u2211 \u2206=\u2206\n= =\nn\ni\nm\nj\nijSS\n1 1\n  and  \u2211 \u2211 \u2206=\u2206\n= =\nn\ni\nm\nj\nijTT\n1 1\n  (7) \n \nA ratio of element against system energy errors is then recommended to evaluate stiffness \nand mass modelling errors for each of the elements in percentage \n 5\n \n       RK S Si i= \u22c5( \/| |) (%)\u2206 \u2206 100  and RM T Ti i= \u22c5( \/| |) (%)\u2206 \u2206 100   (8) \n \nThe RKi and RMi, which are used as an indicator of locating poor modelling, would have \nsignificantly higher magnitude for a poorly modelled element than correct one. Their sign \nalso indicates an underestimation (+) or overestimation (-) of the stiffness or\/and mass in \nthe analytical model. \nAlthough the above RKi and RMi, provide a useful indicator to localise poorly \nmodelled elements, the result is approximate and an uncertainty remains as weather a \nsmall value of RKi and RMi, indicates a small modelling error or just accuracy error? Such \nuncertainty is especially concerned in the region adjacent to the poorly modelled elements. \nThis problem occurring in the initial stage of modelling error localization causes difficulty \nto achieve high accuracy and reliability of locating and improving poor modelling. In \norder to solve the problem, further investigation has been carried out and a method to \nfurther distinguish the poorly modelled from correctly modelled elements has been \nproposed and described below.  \n \n2.2.2 Final Localisation   \n \nThe method for further locating poorly modelled elements is based on the sign rather \nthan the magnitude difference between the energy errors of poorly and correctly modelled \nelements. From equations (5-6), it is noted that the modal error {\u2206\u03a6}j plays major role in \nenergy error estimation. This is because it contains more explicit and useful information \nabout the location and magnitude of modelling errors than \u2206\u03bbj. Since {\u2206\u03a6}j in a poorly \nmodelled region is caused directly by a local modelling error, it should remain the same \nsign for any mode. While in a correctly modelled region, where {\u2206\u03a6}j is caused indirectly \nby modelling errors beyond the region, the sign of {\u2206\u03a6}j and hence \u2206Sij and \u2206Tij may vary \nin different mode. Such sign variation can be worked out from equation (5) and used as an \nindicator to distinguish the correctly modelled elements from those poorly modelled ones. \nFor example, if the sign of \u2206Sij and\/or \u2206Tij for the ith element changes when using a \ndifferent mode, this element stiffness and\/or mass may be identified as correctly modelled. \nThe element thus can be excluded from the poor modelling region regardless of its initial \nRKi and RMi values. If the sign remains the same as mode varies, the element would be \nidentified as poorly modelled and thus should be included in the poor modelling region for \nsubsequent model improvement. Although it has been noted that some modes may play \nmore significant role than others in modelling error detection, generally speaking the more \nmeasured modes are available and used, the more reliable result would be expected. In \npractice however, because of the inevitable measurement errors and incomplete \nmeasurements in both spatial and modal coordinates, this method may not guarantee to \nfilter off all correctly modelled elements from the initially located poorly modelled \nregions. Nevertheless this method provides a useful tool to enhance the accuracy and \nreliability of the localization result. It is simple, efficient and accurate provided that the \neffect on {\u2206\u03a6}j by measurement errors is less than that by modelling errors.  \n \n2.3  IMPROVEMENT OF POOR ELEMENT MODELLING \n \nAfter localizing the poorly modelled elements, model improvement may be carried \nout with confidence by evaluating the stiffness and\/or mass error matrix [\u2206Ki] and [\u2206Mi], \n 6\nand then modifying the original [Ki]a and\/or [Mi]a. Assuming [\u2206Ki] and [\u2206Mi] are a \nfraction of [Ki]a and [Mi]a of each element respectively, an approximation of them may be \nobtained by using the estimated RKi and RMi as follows: \n \n [\u2206Ki] = FKi [Ki]a   and  [\u2206Mi] = FMi [Mi]a     (9) \n \nwhere FKi = Fk x RKi and FMi = Fm x RMi with Fk and Fm representing weighting factors \nfor stiffness and mass modelling improvement respectively. \nAn initial model improvement can be achieved by substituting the above estimated \n[\u2206Ki] and [\u2206Mi] back into equation (2). Based on the improved model, further \nimprovement can be carried out by repeating the above procedure. As the model is further \nimproved, the remaining [\u2206Ki] and [\u2206Mi] hence RKi and RMi would become smaller. Such \niterative implement can be carried out until the estimated RKi and RMi converge to a \nspecified small value. Consequently the accuracy of predicted modes based on the \nimproved model would be increased to achieve a minimum difference from the measured \nmodes.

APPLICATION TO A TAIL-PLANE STRUCTURE \n \nA full-scale tail-plane structure of 5.95 m in span and 1.83 m in mainframe length as \nshown in Figure 1 was used for demonstration. The tail-plane is suspended by an elastic \nbungee at the front end of its main frame and seated on two vertical beams at its back ends. \nIn the current demonstration of model improvement, the tail-plane structural modelling was \nlargely simplified by using 3-D beam elements as illustrated in Figure 2.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    Figure 1.

Similarly, a mass \nmatrix of the same order assembled from nodal mass matrix of 6x6 order was created to \nrepresent the mass properties of the structure. Considering the symmetric configuration of \nthe structure, only half of the structure was modelled. The modal analysis for symmetric \nand anti-symmetric modes was carried out separately. The first 9 modes with frequency \nvalues listed in Table 1 were obtained as the analytical results.  \n \n Table 1.

To keep the configuration symmetrical, \nthe same difference as above was made on the opposite (right) side of the \u2018test\u2019 model. In \nthis example, although eight symmetrical modes of the \u2018test\u2019 structure have been predicted \nas shown in Table 1, only the six flexible modes, i.e. modes 3 \u2013 8 were used as available \n\u2018test\u2019 modes in the model improvement procedure as described below. In this idealized \nexample, the \u2018test\u2019 modes are assumed to be spatially complete and noise-free. Hence \nexcellent modelling error locating result is expected. \n \n3.1.1 Modelling error localization   \n \nUsing the analytical model and the six \u2018test\u2019 modes in equations (6-8), an initial \nenergy error distribution of the analytical model was obtained as shown in Figure 3. The \nsignificantly large values of RKi and RMi indicate that poor stiffness modelling is most \nlikely to occur in elements 9 and 10, and poor mass modelling in element 11. Due to \nsymmetric configuration, similar modelling errors are also expected on the opposite side \nof the analytical model. It is noted that non-zero RKi and RMi values also appear beyond \nthose elements. However they could be caused by approximation of the method or very \nsmall modelling errors since their values are significantly small.  \n 8\nIn order to further distinguish the poorly modelled elements from the correctly \nmodelled ones, effort has been made to clear the above diagram of initial modelling error \ndistribution. Using Eq(5) in this second stage, the sign of energy error \u2206Sij and \u2206Tij for \neach element and mode was obtained. Figure 4 shows that for all elements apart from 9 & \n10, the sign of \u2206Sij changes at least once when a different mode is used. This reinsures us \nthat only the stiffness of elements 9 & 10 is poorly modelled. Similarly, Figure 5 shows \nthat only elements 6 & 11 contain mass modelling errors, while the other possible errors \nidentified initially can be cleared away from Figure 3. As the result, a much clearer view of \nmodelling error distribution can be obtained as shown in Figure 6. Comparing with the \nanalytical model, the negative RK9 and RK10 indicate that the \u2018test\u2019 structure actually has \nsmaller stiffness within its elements 9 and 10 region. While the positive RMi indicates that \nmore mass actually exists in the region of element 11. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       Figure 3.

A clear view of modelling error localization \n \n \n3.1.2 Model Improvement   \n \nHaving localized the modelling errors as shown in Figure 6, the subsequent model \nimprovement may be carried out by using equations (2), (8) & (9) in an iterative manner or \nminimising \u2206f in a trial and error approach. In this example, the above estimated RKi, RMi \nand equation (9) with weighting factors Fk=0.4 and Fm=0.09 were used to evaluate [\u2206Ki] \nand [\u2206Mi], which were then substituted into equation (2) to improve the original [K]a and \n[M]a.  \nSince the model could not be completely corrected in one performance as above, the \nsame procedure were repeated based on the previously improved model until the remaining \nerrors became smaller than a specified value. In this example, the iteration was carried out \nuntil the evaluated Fk x RKi and Fm x RMi became less than 3% of their first iteration \nvalues as shown in Table 2. In the model improvement, Fm x RM6 for element 6 was too \nsmall and hence ignored. The sum of Fk x RKi and Fm x RMi from above iterations gives a \nratio of the final evaluated [\u2206Ki] against the original [K]a and [\u2206Mi] against [M]a \nrespectively. According to equations (2) & (9), the result shows that the original stiffness \nfor elements 9 & 10 should be reduced by 11% and the original mass in element 11 should \nbe increased by 9.2% as final improvement. As a result, the modelling errors in the \nanalytical model have been reduced from initial 10% down to less than 1%. \n \n \n   Table 2.

In the vibration test, most of the 29 accelerometers were \nmounted along the front and rear spars of the tail-plane as shown in Figure 7 and limited \nto measuring the vertical movement. By applying the quadratic interpolation method, the \nout of plane measurements were used to obtain the intermediate unmeasured \ndisplacements, i.e. the out of plane vertical and torsional displacements and span-wise \nbending slopes. Due to the lack of in plane measurements however, analytical values were \nused as the displacements at the intermediate unmeasured DOFs, i.e. in plane translations \nand yaw. However, it should be noted that these analytical values do not contribute to any \nenergy errors. Hence some compromise in the performance of the error localisation and \naccuracy of the model improvement can be expected.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Figure 7.

By applying the EEE method, the total \nstrain and kinetic energy errors on both sides of the analytical model were estimated from \nequations (6) & (7) and listed in Table 5. It shows that the strain energy error RKi on the \nleft side of the model is obviously larger than that on the right side. Hence large stiffness \nmodelling errors is likely to exist on the left side of the analytical model. It also shows that \nthe kinetic energy error RMi is much lower than the RKi on both sides of the model.

It can be seen from Figure 8a that the stiffness errors are most likely to be \nlocated in the elements 9 and 10 on the left side, and also at the root elements of the \nanalytical model. The negative sign of the errors indicate smaller stiffness in the actual \nstructure than that being modelled. Figure 8b shows an even distribution of RMi indicating \nmass modelling errors of the model. Since the maximum RMi value reaches only about \n1.5% of the sum of RMi values, which is very small comparing with the RKi shown in \nFigure 8a, the mass modelling errors are ignored in the subsequent model improvement. \nAlthough the modelling error distributions obtained so far are reasonable clear, it would \nbe desirable to have a clearer view for more accurate localization of the modelling errors, \nespecially in the regions with relatively low RKi values. At this stage, equation (5) was \nused to get the sign variation of element energy error for each of the modes as shown in \nFigure 9 (elements beyond 13 are excluded due to their small errors as shown in Figure 8).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Figure 8a.

This indicates that only those elements were poorly modelled \nin terms of stiffness, and the rest of elements were correctly modelled. Figure 9b shows \nthat none of the kinetic energy errors remains the same sign for different modes. This \nreinsures that the original mass modelling is good enough and thus no improvement is \nrequired in this case. Focusing on the stiffness modelling errors and clearing out those \nfault errors initially identified as shown in Figure 8a, a clearer view of locations of \nstiffness modelling errors for the left side of the tail-plane was obtained as shown in \nFigure 10.  \nThe negative values of RKi shown in Figure 10 indicate that some local regions of the \ntail-plane actually have smaller stiffness than that of the original analytical model.

The small modelling errors remaining in the elements 11 & 12 may \nbe due to the effect of the neighbouring structural damage and approximation of the \nmethod. The large modelling error of element 1 was likely caused by the model \nsimplification of the junction between tail-plane and its main supporting beam as shown in \nFigures.1 & 2. Those modelling errors caused significant differences between the predicted \nmodes from the original model and measured modes of the structure as shown in Table 6.  \n \n \n3.2.2 Analytical Model Improvement \n \n3.2.2.1. First improvement In order to improve the original analytical model, attention \nwas then focused on the poor modelling regions to evaluate the stiffness error matrix [\u2206Ki] \nfor elements 1, 9 and 10 using equation (9). By substituting the obtained [\u2206Ki] into \nequation (2), an improved [K]a of 20% stiffness (EI, GJ) reduction for element 1 & 9, and \n22% reduction for element 10 was obtained. Consequently, the average mode errors of the \nimproved analytical model were reduced, from the original \u2206f=4.6% to 3.8% and from \n\u2206\u03a6=14.3% to 13.3% as shown in Table 6. After the above first improvement however, \nstiffness modelling errors still remained in the analytical model as shown in Figure 10.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Figure 10.

Second improvement If the above procedure was repeated based on the \nimproved model, a further 20% stiffness reduction for elements 1 & 9 and 40% reduction \nfor element 10 were estimated. Subsequently a further reduction of the remaining stiffness \nmodelling errors was made after the second improvement as shown in Figure 10. However, \ncomparing with the measured modes again as shown in Table 6, it was noted that the \naverage \u2206f was slightly increased from 3.81% up to 3.90% although the average \u2206\u03a6 was \nreduced further from 13.25% to 10.15%. It was also noted that such large reduction of \nstiffness would not give a good representation of the actual structure. It was then suspected \nthat some modelling errors remained unidentified in the regions beyond those located so \nfar. The failure to locate those errors may be mainly because of the lack of measurement \nalong the supporting frames of the tail-plane. Hence, an alternative approach for further \nmodel improvement has to be considered. \n3.2.2.3. Further improvement In this example, it was assumed that the measured \nfrequencies were more accurate and reliable than mode shapes. Thus, an approach based on \nthe analysis of frequency sensitivity to the variation of element stiffness parameters was \nused. In the analysis, only measured frequencies were used as the reference base to \nminimize the effect of inadequate measurement of mode shapes on further model \nimprovement.   \nFirstly we focused on the region of junction between the tail-plane and its main \nsupporting frame. The analytical model was updated by adding two more elements \nbetween nodes 1 \u2013 15 and 1 \u2013 18 as shown in Figure 12. This updated model should give a \nmore realistic representation of the actual structure and provide more parameters for \nsensitivity analysis and model improvement in the region. \nIn the analysis, although all measured frequencies were considered, attention was paid \nmainly to the first symmetric mode and all the anti-symmetric modes, which had relatively \nlarge errors. It was found that the first symmetric mode was sensitive to the bending stiffness \nof the new elements 1- 15, 1 \u2013 18 and element 20 - 21 at the back. The first anti-symmetric \nmode was also sensitive to the new elements 1- 15, 1 \u2013 18, but the third mode was more \nsensitive to elements 19 \u201320 & 20 \u2013 21. From the sensitivity analysis, bending & torsion \n 16\nstiffness of the new elements 1-15, 1-18 was determined to be 16.53 N.m2 and the bending \nstiffness of element 19-20 was reduced from 6.612 N.m2 to 4.959 N.m2. Following the above \nstiffness updating, the mode errors were further reduced. A comparison between the \nfrequencies of the original model, improved model using EEE method and further improved \nmodel using sensitivity method is shown in Table 6. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Figure 12.

CONCLUDING REMARKS \n \nThe energy error estimation method provides a feasible and efficient tool for model \nimprovement based on a set of incomplete measured modes. The method is applicable to \nlocating the regions of analytical modelling errors or structural damage. From the \ninvestigation of this current paper, the following conclusions can be extracted. \n\u2022 By using this method, both the stiffness and mass modelling errors of an analytical \nmodel can be identified and localised. \n\u2022 In the initial localisation of modelling errors, the result was approximate due to the \neffect of the limit of the method and available measured modes. However an additional \nmeasure proposed in this method can increase the localisation accuracy. This is the \nmajor advantage of the method in terms of accuracy. \n\u2022 Although the method depends upon the quality of measured modes, the regions with \nsignificant modelling errors such as the damage region can be distinguished from good \nmodelling regions. \n\u2022 In the regions such as the supporting frames of the tail-plane where few measurements \nwere made, the estimated energy errors won\u2019t be accurate enough to indicate \nmodelling errors. In such case, sensitivity analysis based on measured frequencies \nprovides an effective alternative. \n\u2022 The model improvement is restricted to only those regions where modelling errors \nhave been identified. This ensures the reliability and accuracy of the improved model. \n\u2022 The improved analytical model retains its original matrix size and configuration and \nthus retains the physical description of the system. \nFinally it has been noted in this method that some modes may play more significant role \nthan others to locate modelling errors. This may raise a concern of mode sensitivity of the \nmethod.

Although in practice we \nnormally don\u2019t have much choice of the very limited available measured modes, an \ninvestigation into this modal sensitivity problem is recommended, but beyond the scope of \nthis current paper. \n \n \nREFERENCES \n \n1.
