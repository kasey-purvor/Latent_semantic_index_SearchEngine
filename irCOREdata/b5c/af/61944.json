Information is \ndrawn from the extensive Environment Agency (EA) database to characterise long-term patterns in water \nquality and to examine spatial coverage and long-term patterns of change for Total Oxidised Nitrogen \n(TOxN) and total reactive phosphorus (TRP) across the region.  This study area has a relatively low \nhuman population density (176 people per km2 compared with 379 and 430 people per km2 for England \nand SE England respectively (Office of National Statistics, 2008)), and this study will provide an \nimportant contrast to previous studies of highly urbanised catchments that are typical of southern Britain. \nThere are five strategic reasons for this study. (1) It is this type of region with high agricultural coverage \nwhere the UK debate on farming, regional economics and the aquatic environment is critical. (2) \nIntensive agricultural areas in this part of the UK have received little attention. (3) The Water Framework \nDirective (WFD) requires a basin-wide integrated approach and the study of these coastal Suffolk rivers \nprovides a representative example and at an appropriate scale to consider this approach. (4)  There are \nrequirements for ongoing monitoring to support both understanding of catchment function and \nmanagement of water quality; the utility of existing data must be assessed in order to inform and target \nfuture monitoring requirements. (5) The coastal context of these rivers makes their catchment areas of \necological significance in respect of freshwater, inter-tidal and coastal habitat provision of national and \ninternational significance (Howden et al., 2006). \n \nBackground \nIn recent decades there has been a major research effort to determine nutrient concentrations and fluxes \nfrom agricultural areas and their impact on surface waters (Neal and Heathwaite, 2005), largely due to the \nEuropean Community Water Framework Directive (WFD: EA, 2002) which is designed to foster \nimproving the ecology and amenity value of UK surface waters (e.g. Hilton et al., 2006).  For the UK, \nphosphorus (P) rather than nitrogen (N) is generally considered to be the limiting nutrient in rivers \nPage 3 of 23 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n(Mainstone and Parr, 2002;  Withers and Lord, 2002) and much attention is focussed on the lowlands, \nwhere nutrient inputs are greatest due to high population densities and intensive\/extensive agriculture.  A \ncentral water quality issue is the impact of nitrogen (nitrate) and phosphorus (phosphate) on \neutrophication (EA, 2000, Withers and Lord, 2002, Mainstone and Parr, 2002 and DEFRA, 2004), both of \nwhich derive primarily from sewage and agricultural sources.  Knowledge of the relative contributions of \nnutrients from these sources is vital for effective river catchment management (Withers and Sharpley, \n2008). \nIn addressing nutrient sources, the WFD requires the control of both point and diffuse inputs into water \nbodies, which might well prove costly; in the case of farming, large changes may be required to lower \nnutrient concentrations below ecologically significant thresholds.  As point sources of pollution are \nincreasingly controlled, non-point or diffuse sources of pollution become relatively more important. \nHowever, given the complexity of agricultural landscapes, managing the risk of diffuse pollution is not \nstraightforward (Burt and Pinay, 2005), because diffuse pollution varies considerably as a complex \nfunction of soil type, climate, topography, hydrology, land use and management (Heathwaite et al., 2005).  \nThis can create widespread, intermittent and poorly defined contaminant sources that degrade water \nquality in a way that makes their control difficult.  Most research on diffuse pollution has involved \nsurface and near-surface flow paths, but in catchments with high groundwater baseflow contributions, \nthere is an added complexity because of the long pathways and residence times involved in nutrient \ntransfer through the aquifer (Mathias et al., 2007). Major sources of inorganic P, are often associated with \nhigh population density and sewage treatment work (STW) discharges and even in agricultural areas, \ninputs from habitation and local STWs cannot generally be ignored (Muscutt and Withers, 1996; Neal et \nal., 1998c, 2004b, 2006a, 2008a,b; Bowes et al., 2005a; Neal and Jarvie, 2005;  Jarvie et al., 2006a). \nThus, catchments that are defined in terms of \u201crural\u201d or \u201cagricultural\u201d are a misnomer: such catchments \nare a mix of rural farming, rural settlement and in some cases peri-urban components (Neal et al., 2006a). \nHence the system needs to be considered in a more \u201cholistic\u201d way that in some respects is much fairer to \nthe farming community in terms of pollutant sources and impacts. \nPage 4 of 23 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \nFor NO3, agriculture is considered the predominant source (Johnes and Burt, 1993; Neal et al., 2006b), \nbut leaching from farmland is linked to many factors such as fertilisation, soil texture, land use, \ndisturbance, crop rotation and effluent disposal (Vinten and Smith, 1993). \nFor environmental management purposes it is essential to assess the levels of their inputs and provide \nfocussed measures for amelioration strategies (Neal and Jarvie, 2005); and in the lowlands where \nagriculture often provides the dominant inputs of nitrate, and there are clear measures in place for \nremediation such as the introduction of nitrate vulnerable zones (DoE, 1993; Jordan and Smith, 2005). \nFor phosphate, there is often a more balanced mix of fluxes from agricultural and various effluent sources \nacross many parts of the British lowlands (Mainstone and Parr, 2002; Smith et al., 2005a;  Wood et al., \n2005).  Point effluent sources are of particular importance in terms of eutrophication risk, as dilution \npotential is low during summer low-flows, while biological activity is high (Neal and Jarvie, 2005;  Jarvie \net al., 2006). \nIn many lowland areas in the UK, and the south of England in particular, there are growing pressures for \nincreased housing in rural and agricultural \u2018green belt\u2019 areas (Evans et al., 2003).  Increased habitation \ndensity will lead to increased nutrient loading to rivers from increased STW requirements unless more \nstringent control on nutrient fluxes is introduced.  This increasing pressure will be exacerbated by reduced \ndilution resulting from increased abstraction of water from the river and groundwater sources.  Further, \nwith increased global warming and predicted reduction in rainfall for the lowland UK (UKCIP, 2008), the \nproblem of low flows and increased water usage requirements will compound the problem. \nPage 5 of 23 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n \nStudy area \nGeneral \nThe data presented here cover the river catchment areas of Suffolk between Southwold in the north to the \nAlde-Ore estuary in the south (Figure 1).  The landscape is predominantly rural in character, largely used \nfor arable farming.  Spatial land-use data (NRFA, 2008) show that predominant land use is arable and \nhorticulture (74 to 76%, England average 34.1%), with grassland (12 to 15%, England average 38.1%), \nwoodland (4.4 to 7%, England average 11.0%) and built-up areas (4 to 5%, England average 11.2%). \nThe main rivers draining the area are the Blyth to the north, and the Alde-Ore system to the south, with \nrecorded average annual rainfall (1961-1990) of around 600 mm (Blyth 591 mm; Alde 592 mm; Ore \n597mm).  General characteristics of the main river catchments are given in Table 1. \nThe rivers considered here are small (mean flow 1961 to 2006 <0.5 m3s-1), flow from west to east, and are \nclose to the coast, and so are recognised for their ecological significance:  for example the Easton Broad \nRiver (see Figure 1), is designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) for most of its length, and \nthe lower reaches form part of the Benacre to Easton Bavents Lagoons, designated as a Special Area of \nConservation (SAC) under the EU habitats directive (Howden et al., 2006).\nPage 6 of 23 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n \nData Sources \nWater quality data were provided by the Environment Agency of England and Wales (EA) for 60 sample \nsites for the period between August 1981 and October 2005.  This included:  sets of major ion data for the \nRiver Blyth at Blyford, the River Alde at Langham and the River Ore at Beversham;  around 60 sites \nsampled on a minimum of 40 occasions over the period for the following determinands: alkalinity at pH \n4.5 (as CaCO3); ammonia (as N); chloride (as Cl); chlorophyll-a; nitrite (as N); TOxN; TRP or \northophosphate (as P); pH; dissolved reactive silica (as SiO2); suspended solids at 105\u00b0C; water \ntemperature; and turbidity.  It is important to note that the data presented by the EA as SRP concentration \nis actually total reactive phosphorus, as the sample is unfiltered (Mainstone et al., 2000).   Conversions \nwere used to express alkalinity at pH 4.5 as bicarbonate (HCO3), which was then also used to calculate \nthe excess partial pressure of carbon dioxide (EpCO2) using the method outlined by Neal et al.(2000). The \nhydrometric data used came from the National River Flow Archive (NRFA) datasets \n(www.ceh.ac.uk\/data\/nrfa\/index.html) for catchment stations (see Figure 1) ref. 35003 (River Alde at \nFarnham), 35004 (River Ore at Beversham) and 35013 (River Blyth at Holton), are also used to \ninvestigate relationships between concentrations and flow. \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \nMethods \nThe long-term monitoring data were summarised in a GIS-framework and used to support three sets of \nanalyses, the salient points of which are presented here: \n1. Major ion concentrations, inter-determinand relationships and relationships with flow to support \ninterpretation of catchment hydrological and hydrochemical functioning. \n2. Spatial distributions of nutrient concentrations over the region and relationships with biological \nindicators such as pH and EpCO2 \n3. Where sufficient data were available, decomposition of nutrient concentration time series into diffuse- \nand point-source inputs, to provide an indication of the importance of different source-types and their \nrelative contribution to N and P loading. \nPage 7 of 23 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \nFor items 1, and 2, the information is presented in the form of panel plots for determinands, summary \ntables and regional maps, while for item 3 the following methodology was used. \nThe relationships between nutrient concentration and flow at each study site were assessed using the Load \nApportionment Model (Bowes et al., 2008).  The model is based on the fundamental difference in the \ntiming of point and diffuse nutrient inputs.  Point source inputs from sewage treatment works are \nrelatively constant through the year, and will be unrelated to river flow.  Therefore, if a river received all \nof its nutrient input from STW effluent, the nutrient load would remain constant, and concentrations \nwould decrease reciprocally with increasing river flow.  Diffuse sources are predominantly rainfall \ndependant, and therefore a river receiving only diffuse nutrient input would receive increasing nutrient \nload with increasing river flow.  The Load Apportionment Model quantifies these constant \n(approximating to point source) inputs and rain \/ flow-dependent (approximating to diffuse source) inputs \nusing a simple power-law function, to parameterise empirical fits to paired flow and nutrient \nconcentration observed at each study site.  The model also determines the flow, Qe, at which point and \ndiffuse inputs to the river are equal, which is of great value when considering nutrient management \noptions (Bowes et al., 2008).   \nThe Load Apportionment Model requires that the empirical data set of phosphorus and flow for each site \ncovers the full river flow conditions observed at the site.  The data sets used in this study are based on \nmonthly sampling interval, which can greatly under-represent high flow events and their related \nphosphorus exports (Jordan et al., 2005).  However, due to the long period of monthly monitoring used in \nthis study, each data set consists of relatively large numbers of observations (River Blythe, n = 120; River \nAlde, n = 270; River Ore, n = 224) which will capture the full range of river flows. \nPage 8 of 23 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n \nResults \nGeneral \nWater quality data from the period 1981 to 2005 are summarised in Table 3.  Major ion data (alkalinity, \ncalcium, chloride, magnesium, potassium, sodium, and sulphate) are available at three sites:  the River \nFromus at Gromford, the River Blyth at Blyford and the River Alde at Farnham (Table 2).  These data are \nplotted to show inter-ion relationships (Figure 2).  Examples of relationships between major ions and flow \nare shown for the River Alde in Figure 3. \nWater Quality \nThe waters are generally of a Ca HCO3 type and they are also Na, Cl and SO4 bearing. Of the cation \ncharge Ca has 51 to 83% (Blyth:  51-82%; Alde:  68-83%; Fromus 59-78%) and Na 11 to 41% (Blyth:  \n11-41%;  Alde:  11-22%;  Fromus:  14-28%). Of the anion charge, HCO3 (alkalinity) has 35 to 72% \n(Blyth:  35-65%;  Alde:  50-72%;  Fromus:  50-68%), Cl 10 to 36% (Blyth:  10-36%;  Alde:  12-18%;  \nFromus:  13-23%) and SO4 9 to 38% (Blyth:  9-35%;  Alde:  12-38%;  Fromus:  19-28%). \nInter-determinand correlations (and with flow, where available) for the three rivers show the following: \nRiver Blyth  Positive correlations occur between Cl and Mg (r = 0.848, p<0.0001).

Chloride \nconcentrations are higher for sampling sites close-to or below the tidal limit with extremely high \nconcentrations in some places (i.e. >10,000 mg Cl l-1 on a regular basis).  \nRegional long-term TRP \/ TOxN monitoring \nConcentrations of total oxidised nitrogen (TOxN) vary (Figure 4a): average concentration for the region \nis 7.85 mg N l-1, with a range in average of 0.59 to 15.07 mg N l-1.  Lowest average concentrations (0.59 \nmg N l-1) are observed in the Dunwich River (which also tends to have high Cl - average 78 mg l-1), and \nthe highest average concentrations are observed in the River Wang to the north (15.07 mg N l-1). \nFor the purposes of water quality management within the Nitrates Directive, the maximum allowable \nconcentration for drinking water is 11.3 mg N l-1, which would most likely be an assessment criterion for \nsurface waters, excepting heavily modified water bodies.  With the exception of the Rivers Wang and \nOre, where average TOxN concentrations already exceed this threshold (133 and 105% respectively) and \nthe Dunwich River where concentrations are very low (5% of the threshold limit), the remainder are \npresently at between  29 and 91% of this limit, with the Lothingland Hundred River (91%), Easton Broad \nRiver (72%), Minsmere River (71%), River Alde (86%), River Fromus (77%) and Black Ditch (72%) all \nat more than 70% of the limit. \nThe average TRP concentration across the region is 0.73 mg P l-1, with the range of averages for \ncomponent rivers lying between 0.05 and 4.47 mg P l-1 (Figure 4b).  There remains some uncertainty as to \nwhat threshold will be set for environmental management purposes, but two emerging values are used as \ntargets for annual averages.  For high alkalinity waters, such as those encountered in this study, values of \n0.120 and 0.05 mg P l-1 are suggested (WFD UK TAG, 2006):  the respective values classify the rivers in \nterms of \u2018Good\u2019 and \u2018High\u2019 ecological status.  With the exception of samples from the Ore\/Alde Estuary \nand the River Tang (0.07 and 0.05 mg P l-1) which lie within the \u2018Good\u2019 ecological status range, all other \nPage 10 of 23 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \nrivers have annual averages above the higher of the two thresholds;  in the best case (Dunwich River \naverage 0.14 mg P l-1) the exceedence is only marginal (115%), but in the worst case (River Wang 4.47 \nmg P l-1) the exceedence is around 3729% above the threshold for \u2018Good\u2019 ecological status.  There are no \nindications of a one-off pollution event skewing these data, rather consistently high P concentrations over \nthe period of record.  Out of 59 sites considered here, 53 (90%) were found to have annual average TRP \nconcentrations greater than the 0.05 mg P l-1 threshold, and 36 (61%) had average concentrations over \n0.120 mg P l-1. \nTRP \/ TOxN and flow relationships \nGeneral 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \nThe relationship between TRP and TOxN concentrations with river volumetric flow are shown for the \nAlde at Farnham in Figure 5a and 5b, Ore at Beversham Figure 5c and 5d and the Blyth at Holton in \nFigures 5e and 5f, with the associated solutions from the Load Apportionment modelling shown in Figure \n6, and parameter values produced from the modelling are given in Table 4. \nConcentration-flow relationships (TRP and TOxN) 14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nTRP relationships with flow show that the highest TRP concentrations occur at low flows, indicating a \npoint source input at each site.  These point sources are of particular relevance, as they will tend to occur \nduring the summer periods when biological activity\/response is at a maximum (Neal et al., 2005; Jarvie et \nal., 2006).  The TRP concentrations are relatively high at high flows for the River Alde at Farnham and \nthe River Ore at Beversham, and therefore the TRP load increases with increasing river discharge, \nindicating that there is a significant, rainfall-dependant input of phosphorus. TOxN relationships with \nflow at all three sites show a pattern typical of diffuse source dominance, with a positive gradient in the \nconcentration \/ flow relationship at low to intermediate flows.  At higher flows the TOxN concentrations \neither remained constant (for the Rivers Alde and Ore) at high flows, but decreased for the River Blyth, \nindicating a possible depletion of TOxN within the catchment during major storm events. \n \nPage 11 of 23 \nSource apportionment - TRP 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \nThe Load Apportionment modelled fits to the concentration \/ flow data are shown in Figure 6, and the \nload coefficient values are given in Table 4.  For the River Alde at Farnham, the model estimated that \nflow-dependent (approximating to diffuse source) inputs contributed 88.4 % of the total annual TRP load, \nindicating that agriculture was the predominant source of phosphorus to the river.  However, constant \nphosphorus inputs (approximating to point sources) are dominant at flows of up to 0.14 m3 s-1 (the \ncalculated Qe value) which, according to the available flow records, equated to 59% of the sampling \nperiod.  Above this flow, diffuse sources become dominant with total load apportionment results \nsuggesting 11.6 % contribution from point source inputs and the remaining 88.4 % coming from diffuse \nsources.  \nFor the River Ore at Beversham, results are presented for three discrete periods as they show contrasting \npatterns of behaviour. \nPeriod 1 (1983 to November 1992): constant (point source) inputs are dominant up to a volumetric flow \nrate of 0.37 m3 s-1, which accounts for around 91% of the flow record, with estimated total TRP load \ncontributions of 41.4 % and 58.6 % for point and diffuse sources respectively. \nPeriod 2 (1993 to November 1996): The model was unable to produce a satisfactory solution, as the data \nset during this period did not include any high \u2013 flow data points, due to the large sampling interval.  This \nhighlights the problems associated with the existing EA data sets, and shows that efforts should be made \nto sample UK rivers at a much higher temporal resolution in the future, so that true nutrient load estimates \ncan be made and new methodologies such as the Load Apportionment Model can be applied to them. \nPeriod 3 (1997 to November 2003): constant TRP contributions are dominant at flows of up to 0.31 m3 s-\n1, which accounts for around 72 % of the period of record, leading to estimated TRP load contributions of \n36.7% and 63.3% for constant (point) and flow dependent (diffuse) sources respectively. \nFor the River Blyth at Holton, constant (point source) inputs are dominant at flows of up to 0.177 m3 s-1, \nwhich accounts for around 58% of the period of record, and leads to an estimated TRP load \napportionment of 30.6% and 69.4% for point and diffuse sources respectively. \nPage 12 of 23 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \nThe model appears to have produced realistic apportionments in these predominantly rural catchments.  \nThe River Ore and River Blyth receive point source inputs from sewage treatment works serving the \ntowns of Framlingham and Halesworth respectively, and this \u2018constant input\u2019 signal is clearly detected by \nthe Load Apportionment Model.  The River Alde catchment has no sewage treatment works upstream of \nFarnham, which explains why the model identified the river as being dominated by flow-dependent \ninputs.  However, the model still detected a clear continuous input, despite this lack of STWs in the \ncatchment.  This could be indicative of significant numbers of septic tank inputs that are leaking or are \ndirectly connected to the river rather than soak-aways. \nSource apportionment - TOxN 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \nFor all three rivers, the Load Apportionment Model was unable to detect a constant input signal \nindicating that there is no point source input of TOxN, and concentrations in the river are dominantly \ncontrolled by diffuse source inputs, provided that within-river TOxN denitrification or biological uptake \nis not large during the low-flow months when dilution potential and water volumes are low while point \nsource inputs will be most influential in terms of concentration. \nPage 13 of 23 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n \nDiscussion \nGeneral water quality \nThe waters are generally Ca-HCO3 bearing as a result of soil and bedrock weathering where calcite \n(CaCO3) is present, and they tend to be moderately alkaline and oversaturated with respect to CO2, which \nreflects dissolution of calcite by atmospheric\/soil CO2 and a net excess of respiration over photosynthesis. \nPatterns of decreasing major ion concentrations with flow indicate a groundwater source that becomes \ndiluted at intermediate and high flows \u2013 notably alkalinity, Mg and SO4 reflecting the Crag and \nPalaeogene aquifer sources contributing to baseflow in the River Blyth, and alkalinity, Cl, Mg, Na and \nSO4 reflecting the Chalk, Crag and Palaeogene water contribution to the River Alde. \nStrong linear inter-determinand correlations most likely indicate a lack of chemical reactivity, with net \nconservative mixing processes between high-flow and low-flow endmember concentrations (Jarvie et al., \n2000). \nTRP \nThe River Ore at Beversham and the River Blythe at Holton have estimated diffuse TRP inputs of ca. 60 \nand 70 % of the total load respectively (Table 4), indicating the dominance of agriculture as a source of P \nin these largely arable catchments with low human population density.  However, in terms of controlling \neutrophication, it is the nutrient concentrations (rather than loads) during the plant and algae growing \nseasons that control nuisance epiphytic algal growth, and so are critical for catchment managers to \nconsider (Hilton et al., 2006).  The maximum TRP concentrations observed in the River Blyth and River \nOre occur at flows that are below the calculated Qe value (i.e the flow at which point and diffuse inputs \nare equal) (Figure 6), and so are mostly point source in origin.  Also, most of the data points observed \nduring the algae and plant growing periods also occur at times of point source dominance.  This indicates \nthat even in these predominantly rural catchments with low population density, it is clear that to reduce \neutrophication risk and improve the ecology and water quality at these sites, most phosphorus mitigation \nefforts need to be targeted at sewage inputs. \nPage 14 of 23 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \nThe River Alde at Farnham receives an estimated 88.4% of its annual TRP load from diffuse sources.  \nThe majority of the highest TRP concentrations (around 400 \u00b5g l-1) occur at flows > Qe (Figure 6), but \nthose occurring during the algae growing season occur in equal numbers at flows greater and less than Qe.  \nThis implies that catchment managers should target both sewage and agricultural inputs in this catchment. \nNitrate \nThe long-term average nitrogen concentration for the Suffolk rivers (7.85 mg\/l) is similar to, and slightly \nlower than, that for other agriculturally-impacted eastern UK rivers such as the Great Ouse and Thames \n(average 8.4 and 8.2 mg N l-1 respectively, Neal and Robson, 2000) and for rivers in the Humber Basin \n(average 9.6 mg N l-1, Neal et al., 2008)). The importance of this agricultural component is well-\nestablished and is illustrated for the eastern UK rivers by lower average NO3-N concentrations in the low \nintensity agricultural catchments of the north-eastern UK rivers and the low intensity agricultural and \nindustrial Humber catchments (averages 1.9 and 5.9 mg N l-1 respectively) compared with the agricultural \ncatchments of East Anglia (average 10.5 mg N l-1) (Robson and Neal, 2000; Neal et al., 2008b). \nThere are consistent flow and seasonal patterns for TOxN with higher concentrations during the autumn \nand winter months occurring across all the Suffolk rivers, which most likely reflects a combination of two \nprocesses:  (1) within-river uptake during biologically-active periods of the spring and summer (Bowes et \nal., 2005b) and  (2) flushing of nitrogen from agricultural lands during the autumn and winter periods, \nwhich is largely related to the hydrobiogeochemical processing of N within the catchment, and the timing \nand nature of local farming practices. \nNutrient status and biological water quality  \nGeneral Quality Assessment (GQA) data published by the EA ( available at www.environment-21 \nagency.gov.uk) for biological status, N and P concentrations is shown in Figure 7.  For the period 1990 to \n2000, the percentage length of rivers attaining \u2018very good\u2019 biological status doubles, a change which also \ncorresponds to a more than 50% reduction (40.1 to 13.7%) in river reaches classified as having \u2018very \nhigh\u2019 (> 1.0 mg P l-1) phosphorus concentrations.  Over the same period, there are increases in the \npercentages of river lengths with \u2018high\u2019 or \u2018very high\u2019 nitrate concentrations (30 to 40 or > 40 mg NO3 l-1 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \nPage 15 of 23 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \nrespectively), which suggests that, as found elsewhere (e.g. Neal et al., 2008b), the limiting nutrient is \nphosphorus and that reductions in concentrations released from both agricultural and other (i.e. sewage \ndischarge) point and diffuse sources is of crucial importance to maintain and improve the \u2018good\u2019 \nbiological status, as the most recent assessments indicate a decline over the period 2004 to 2006. \nPage 16 of 23 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n \nConclusions \nThe high concentrations of TRP and TOxN found in most of the Suffolk rivers considered here pose a \nclear challenge for water quality management. Within this context, there are a number of factors which \nwill ultimately determine what management strategies may be required, and how they will be \nimplemented. \nAlthough some successful source-decomposition has enabled a view of the relative contribution of point \nand diffuse TRP sources at different volumetric river flow rates to be made, the present monitoring data is \nnot ideal to define the exact sources, but some conclusions are none-the less evident: \n(1) For TRP, point sources are dominant at low flows, with diffuse sources becoming \ndominant at intermediate to high flow; \n(2) For TOxN, diffuse sources are dominant irrespective of the flow conditions. \nIn order to further improve understanding of the relative importance of TRP sources and links with flow \nconditions, monitoring should continue and be improved to cover a wider range of flow conditions \nthroughout the seasonal cycle, either by introducing storm sampling or increasing the sampling frequency.  \nConsideration should also be given to identifying the relative contributions of agricultural and population-\nbased TRP point sources.  Given such sources control streamwater-TRP during low flow periods, \ncoinciding with periods of primary production, it is essential that attention be focussed on understanding \nthe nature and extent of such sources, enabling development of appropriate strategies to mitigate and \nreduce their influence. \nFor N, reduction in fertiliser applications will not necessarily translate into a rapid of proportional \nreduction in TOxN concentrations in the streams and rivers (e.g. Boorman, 2003) and there are complex \nwithin-catchment processes for both the nutrients and hydrology in relation to the soil, unsaturated and \nsaturated zones (Smettem, 1986; Parker et al., 1991; Jackson et al., 2006). \nIt is of crucial importance that long-term monitoring of such agriculturally-impacted river systems \ncontinues, particularly where that builds on existing data-rich monitoring sites.  However, given the \nPage 17 of 23 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \nongoing multi-faceted challenge of managing resources to maintain ecological quality, it is essential that \nthis is primarily based on detailed understanding and management of the underlying water quality, and \nthe land-management strategies required to maintain and improve this quality, such that WFD ambitions \nto benefit the aquatic environment may be realised. \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe are grateful to the Environment Agency of England and Wales, and the National River Flow Archive \n(NRFA) for supplying the data used in this paper. \nPage 18 of 23 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n \nReferences \nBoorman, D.B.,  LOIS in-stream water quality modelling.
