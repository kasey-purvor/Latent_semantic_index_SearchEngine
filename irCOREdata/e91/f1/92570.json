Time, measured in minutes and hours, is equivalent everywhere, but the meaning of time spent with television depends on disposable (or available) time and what one does with the rest of one\u2019s time. And disposable time for children varies cross-nationally, depending on the length of the school day, bedtime, participation in after school activities, etc, all factors that one cannot \u2018hold constant\u2019 but which can be compared cross-nationally. The challenge was to find a defensible way of comparing countries for their children\u2019s (disposable) time spent with media, in order to interpret statistical differences in time spent with media. 17 To illustrate, children - conceived of as members of an aggregate - can be surveyed for the hours they spend watching television, and children from different countries can be compared in this respect. But what do these comparisons mean? If questions of interpretation enter the frame, which they must, then it must also be recognised that children are participants in forms of social organisation \u2013 cultures of childhood, education systems, the family \u2013 and so cannot be simply compared across countries without taking such systemic factors into account.","cites":null},{"id":17328759,"title":"2 While not all researchers would follow McNeill","authors":[],"date":"1985","doi":null,"raw":"2 While not all researchers would follow McNeill (1985) in interpreting similarities and differences in causal terms - treating cross-national research as a naturalistic experiment on a grand scale - it is disappointing when the mere description of similarities and differences is considered an end in itself rather than the basis for theory. 3 Given that many comparative projects rely on secondary statistics, as collected by national governments, there is strong pragmatic justification for treating the nation as unit, even though problematically nations almost invariably measure key indicators according to different, and not always explicit, assumptions and even though these tend to mask within-nation variation. Nonetheless, if indicators of wealth or internet penetration are available only on a nation-bynation basis, then comparative research on the digital divide will have to use these data along with the cultural assumptions they carry. 4 Even more pragmatically, reference to the nation facilitates the research reporting in terms familiar to research users: public service broadcasters wish to hear how other countries resolve similar problems so as to inform national policy while Unesco wants to know which countries have a more or less biased press so as to direct its intervention.","cites":null},{"id":886214,"title":"A case for co m p ari n g apples with oranges : International di ffer e n c e s in values.","authors":[],"date":"1998","doi":"10.1177\/002071529803900103","raw":null,"cites":null},{"id":17328735,"title":"A case for comparing apples with oranges: International differences in values.","authors":[],"date":"1998","doi":"10.1177\/002071529803900103","raw":"Hofstede, G.
