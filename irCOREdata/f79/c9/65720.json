The paper illustrates some of the diversity and significance of \nminority ethnic economic activity within Birmingham and the potential this holds for \nits future economic development, focusing on examples from three transnational \nnetworks (Chinese business networks, ethnic food manufacturing and the Bhangra \nmusic industry). The paper signals a rather different understanding of \u2018global\u2019 as it \nrelates to economic advantage, transnationalism and ethnic diversity within cities in \ngeneral, and Birmingham in particular. We suggest that this different understanding of \nthe global has important policy implications, not simply in terms of economic \nrepresentations of the city, but also in terms of developing the possibilities of such \ntransnational networks and engaging with the constraints facing them. We argue that \nencouraging a more relational way of thinking about cities like Birmingham has the \npotential for advancing social wellbeing by influencing socio-economic policy and \npractice. We use the example of Birmingham, therefore, to engage broader debates \nabout alternative paths of \u2018global\u2019 economic, social and cultural investment for UK \n(and other) cities. \n \n 2\nIntroduction \nIn a recent treatise on transnational urbanism, Smith (2001) argues for the need to \n\u2018historicize the Global City\u2019 (p.61-63).  He argues that a historical perspective reveals \n\u2018globalisation\u2019 not as a recent all encompassing system of economic power but rather \nas an historically specific, variant, and contested set of economic and social practices \n(see also Held et al., 1999).  In turn,  \nThe urban future\u2026 is far less predictable but far more interesting than the grand narrative of \nglobal capital steam-rolling and swallowing local political elites and pushing powerless people \naround\u2026 Rather than viewing global cities as central expressions of the global accumulation \nof capital, all cities can then be viewed in the fullness of their particular linkages with the \nworlds outside their boundaries (Smith, 2001: 71). \nFurthermore, in addition to acknowledging the need to historicise \u2018the global city\u2019, \nLey (2004) has argued that prevailing accounts of \u2018global cities\u2019 are limited by their \neconomistic tendencies and related suppression of political and cultural domains.  His \nmission is to open up \u2018globe talk\u2019 (2004:162) by acknowledging the agency and \neveryday lived experiences that constitute cosmopolitan, transnational spaces. For \nLey, the privileging of \u2018a view from above\u2019 (p. 154) has meant that the voices of \ndwellers in global cities has, too often, been absent in accounts of these cities. In this \npaper, we draw on these critiques to explore Birmingham, the UK\u2019s second largest \nmetropole, as a \u2018global\u2019 city by highlighting forms of economic globalisation that \ndraw on the city\u2019s residents, their histories and their social and cultural networks.  \nBirmingham\u2019s regeneration programmes during the 1980s and 1990s mirrored \nthose of many other British and North American cities based around \u2018flagship\u2019 \nprojects and the desire to create profitable spaces for predominantly middle-class \nconsumption (Hubbard 1996, Henry and Passmore 1999).  Moreover, as Sandercock \n(2003) has suggested, this prestige-based city centre regeneration reproduced existing \n 3\nsocial, economic and cultural exclusions, which in Birmingham are also racialised, as \nsubstantial resources were diverted from the city\u2019s inner areas to fund these projects \n(see also Loftman and Nevin 1996a, 1996b). Despite their economic, social and \npolitical marginalisation and exclusion from representations of the city, however, \nBirmingham\u2019s minority ethnic communities have long been a source of economic \nvitality and innovation.   \nIn attempting to re-vision Birmingham\u2019s contemporary economic place in the \nworld, the paper develops an account based on the distinctiveness of an economy \nrooted (and routed) in transnational networks; in other words, a distinctiveness drawn \nfrom the city\u2019s multicultural population and their particular linkages with worlds \nbeyond the city\u2019s boundaries (see also Scott, 2001). The intention is, therefore, to \nsignal a rather different understanding of \u2018global\u2019 as it relates to economic advantage, \ntransnationalism (in the form of cross-border connections, see Vertovec, 1999; 2001) \nand ethnic diversity within cities in general, and Birmingham in particular. This \ndifferent understanding of the global has important policy implications, not simply in \nterms of economic representations of the city, but also in terms of developing the \npossibilities of such transnational networks and engaging with the constraints that \nthey face. Significantly, Birmingham City Council has recently recognised the need to \nrevisit its strategic vision to focus on \u2018place making\u2019 as well as \u2018place marketing\u2019 in \nan attempt to link immigrant and poor neighbourhoods with the downtown economy \n(Sandercock 2003).   \n In what follows, we develop these arguments by illustrating some of the \ndiversity and significance of minority ethnic economic activity within Birmingham, \nand the potential this holds for its future economic development.  Our illustrations \nfocus on examples from three transnational networks: Chinese business networks, \n 4\nethnic food manufacturing and the Bhangra music industry.  We conclude by \nsuggesting that Birmingham is a working example of multicultural economic \ndevelopment, whilst acknowledging the problems inherent in the privileging of \nethnicity by global capitalism and the uncritical celebration of multiculturalism.  In so \ndoing, we aim to encourage a more relational way of thinking about cities like \nBirmingham, as a place that can be conceived in terms of \u201cthe articulation of social \nrelations\u201d (Massey 1994, 120) produced by its diverse population. These relations are \nboth located within Birmingham and stretched beyond it, tying the city to wider \nrelations, places and processes (ibid.; see also Amin 2004). This conceptualisation, we \nargue, is important politically because it facilitates the exploration of the conditions \nunder which these networks may either have the potential for advancing social \nwellbeing or, alternatively, (re-)generating exploitation and exclusion. \n \nMinority ethnic business in Birmingham \nBirmingham has received little attention as a \u2018global city\u2019, yet its place in the global \neconomy is evolving in new ways that are often related to its multiculturalism, post-\ncolonialism and the transnationalism of many of its residents.  As a destination for \noverseas investment, through its historical (colonial) links as the \u2018workshop of the \nworld\u2019 (Bryson et al., 1996), and its postcolonial and other migratory paths, \nBirmingham can claim to be a multicultural city.  The 2001 census revealed that \n26.4% of the city\u2019s population categorised themselves as other than \u2018White\u2019, with \n19.5% of the population (over 190,000) identifying as Asian\/Asian British (Office of \nNational Statistics, 2001). The West Midlands region, with the exception of London, \nhas the lowest proportion of people identifying themselves as White (88.8% compared \nwith 90.9% for England as a whole) and above average proportions of White Irish, \n 5\nMixed White and Black Caribbean, Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Black \nCaribbean people (ibid.; see also Barrett et al., 2000). The argument here is that this \ndiversity is recognised as a strength and, indeed, as a route to economic development \n(Henry, 1998; Henry and Passmore, 1999; Henry et al., 2002).  \nIf we start to look beyond the traditional \u2018global city\u2019 imaginaries of \ncontemporary regeneration schemes what other accounts of economic life in the city \nmight be revealed? In terms of ethnicity, Birmingham\u2019s economic position is \nconstructed through, and interwoven with, numerous minority ethnic economic \nnetworks, some more visible than others.  Birmingham\u2019s \u2018overseas Chinese\u2019 \npopulation, for example, is prominent in property development within the city.  The \nareas of Sparkbrook and Sparkhill (see Figure 1) include Pakistani banks and the city \nwill shortly become home to the first branch of the new Islamic Bank of Britain Plc to \nbe located outside London.  The formation of Britain\u2019s first Irish Business \nAssociation in the city is another example of how some of Birmingham\u2019s economic \nnetworks are identified primarily by their ethnicity (Griffin, 1998).  Although \u2018white\u2019 \nbusiness groups do not usually identify themselves in ethnicised terms, the Irish \nbusiness community in Birmingham is constructing an ethnic identity based on \n\u2018minority white\u2019 experiences.  It is explicit about Irishness and economic advantage, \nand includes any business of Irish origin or with trading or cultural links with Ireland.  \n The production of particular commodities has also become associated with \n(minority) ethnicity within the city, for example, ethnic foods and particular musical \nstyles (discussed subsequently).  Birmingham\u2019s multicultural and transnational \neconomic activities extend across a range of economic operations and products.  The \nSparkhill area is the centre for the south Asian jewellery quarter, the retailing of \nclothing, sarees and other textiles.  Perhaps less well known is the Greek-Cypriot fish-\n 6\nfrying network which, as early as 1989, constituted 25% of Birmingham\u2019s 300 fish \nand chip shops (Stewart, 1989). Today, the city\u2019s halal butchers number more than \nfifty; Birmingham\u2019s National Halal Centre is growing through demand from non-\nMuslims and is exporting goods such as halal baby food throughout Europe.   \n[insert Figure 1 here] \nMore widely celebrated is the success of the \u2018Birmingham balti\u2019.  Birmingham and \nthe West Midlands region is world famous for the production and consumption of the \nKashmiri balti, a hybrid product of British Asian cultures that has also been \n\u2018exported\u2019 to other cities in the UK.  The balti is identified with a particular set of \nmigrants to, and residents of, Birmingham and its region.  These migrants have \nredefined this traditional dish so that it combines their ethnic roots with living in a \nspecific western city.  \n Although data is scarce, some figures (which use the limited, rigid framework \nof Census ethnic descriptions) suggest that up to 33% of Birmingham\u2019s business \nactivity occurs within minority ethnic owned enterprises (The Economist, 1998).  The \npossibilities for continued development of this business activity are myriad.  For \nexample, Eastern Foods have launched a range of halal Chinese meals for British \nMuslims who otherwise cannot eat in Chinese restaurants (Birmingham Voice, 2000).  \nAnother example is the 1993 establishment of the Birmingham\/Mirpur Friendship \nAssociation (around 90,000 people in Birmingham originate from the Kashmiri \ndistrict of Mirpur). The Chambers of Commerce in both cities are now incorporated \ninto this Association and are currently in active collaboration to develop and extend \ncommercial links between the two cities.  Furthermore, the recognition of this \nparticular migratory path has seen \u2018fusion housing\u2019 - highly flexible panel and frame \nconcrete structures - proposed by community architects Shillam and Smith for \n 7\ndevelopment in Birmingham\u2019s predominantly Kashmiri-populated districts of Saltley \nand Small Heath (Glancey, 1999).  Finally, Birmingham Chamber of Commerce has \nbeen involved in a recruitment exercise in Mumbai to bring Indian information \ntechnology specialists to the city to fill a skills gap within the local (and national) \neconomy.  This has the potential to position Birmingham within global IT networks \n(BBC Midlands Today, 7\/9\/00) [1]. \nThe range of \u2018ethnic\u2019 economic activity illustrated above derives from the \never-changing but historically circumscribed migratory paths of the residents of \nBirmingham.  The roots of Birmingham\u2019s economy are derived from its centrality \nwithin a (European) colonial past.  A key question to ask of these illustrations is to \nwhat extent might the city\u2019s economic future draw on its post-colonialism and \nmulticulturalism (Jacobs, 1996; Fincher and Jacobs, 1998; Sandercock, 1998, 2003)?  \nIn what follows, we explore specific ethnic-based transnational networks in the city \nand the trading links they incorporate and that might imply a rather different concept \nof \u2018the global city\u2019. Traditionally, such examples of business networks are likely to \nhave been studied under the rubric of \u2018ethnic entrepreneurship\u2019.  The theoretical \nmodels of \u2018replacement labour\u2019, \u2018ethnic niche\/enclave\u2019 and \u2018middleman minority\u2019 \namongst others all highlight the \u2018marginality\u2019 and \u2018sub-optimal\u2019 operation of many \nbusinesses formed through ethnic entrepreneurship (Wilson and Portes, 1980; Aldrich \net al., 1984; Ward and Jenkins, 1984; Ward 1985).  With ethnicity defined, explicitly \nor implicitly, as \u201ca possible outcome of the patterns by which intra- and inter-group \ninteractions are structured\u201d (Waldinger et al., 1990: 32), these literatures also often \nemphasise sources of competitive support (networks, friendship, family, shared value \nsystems, etc.), which are derived from spatial concentration (Greene, 1997).   \n 8\nMore recent framings of ethnic business networks include research into the \n\u2018informal sector\u2019 (Waldinger and Lapp, 1993), often couched in the terms of \u2018the \nThird World comes to the First\u2019 (Portes et al., 1989; Sassen, 1994) [2], and some \nrecent analyses acknowledge the importance of place and broader institutional links \n(see for example the \u2018mixed embeddedness\u2019 approach of Kloosterman et al. 1999). In \nthe work of Light and Gold (2000, 24-25), these literatures are synthesised to identify \nthree concepts reflecting different aspects of \u2018the ethnic economy\u2019 in the USA: the \nethnic ownership economy (consisting of business owners and their co-ethnic helpers \nand workers), the ethnic enclave economy (referring to the territorialisation of such \nethnic ownership economies) and the ethnic-controlled economy (referring to \nnumerical clustering of co-ethnic employees in industries and occupations allowing \nthem to exert appreciable economic power). \nWhile not denying the (political and) analytical power of these approaches in \nadvancing understanding, we argue that a relational analysis of Birmingham\u2019s global \neconomies allows a further perspective on ethnic entrepreneurship. As Albrow (1997: \n51) argues, the competitive advantage of ethnic businesses may derive precisely from \ntheir ability to draw upon networks that \u201cextend as far as their resources and will to \nuse the communication at their disposal\u201d.  In this sense, competitive advantage can be \nas much a product of international and transnational links as of agglomeration and, in \nthe case of immigrant communities, the possible resources at their disposal are both \ntransnational and local (as is their ethnic definition).   \nSome networks in Birmingham reveal economic activities drawing on \ndiasporic links, both local and transnational, to create unique and competitive \nproducts and services.  In this sense we want to move away from \u2018out of the ordinary\u2019 \nnotions of ethnic entrepreneurialism and emphasise that these networks are \n 9\nincreasingly business as usual in Birmingham.  This is not \u2018Third World comes to \nFirst\u2019 through ethnic entrepreneurial sweatshops; rather these economic activities \nshould be framed within the literatures of economic geography concerned with \u2018new \nindustrial spaces\u2019, \u2018networks\u2019 and \u2018commodity chains\u2019. We argue that Birmingham\u2019s \ntransnational economic networks illustrate two points. First, and following Werbner, \nthey highlight the relational qualities of the city\u2019s economy in which,  \nspace needs to be conceptualised not as territory or circumscribed locality but \nas networked and socially produced through the manufacture and flow of \ndistinctive goods between nodal points, vertically as well horizontally \norganized (Werbner 2001, 673). \nSecond, while accepting that these commodities have relative cultural value in and of \nthemselves (see Werbner 1999, 575), these examples illustrate that the commodities \nproduced have an economic presence that is, and ought to be, increasingly significant \nto urban economies. While often difficult to measure or classify in traditional \neconomic terms, we argue that these transnational networks are producing new hybrid \nproducts of economic worth and with distinctive geographies.   \n \nTransnational economic networks in Birmingham \n1. Chinese business networks \nAlthough people identifying as Chinese make up only 1.2 % of Birmingham\u2019s \npopulation (ONS, 2001), in 1987 the City Council designated an area of the city as a \nChinese Quarter, now referred to as the Chinese\/Markets Quarter.  This serves as a \nresource for the city\u2019s Chinese community.  It contains Birmingham\u2019s Chinese Youth \nCentre, the Chinese Community Centre, China Court Business Centre, two health \ncentres, a selection of solicitors, accountants and consultants, foreign exchange \n 10\nfacilities and a wide range of Chinese supermarkets and restaurants.  More \nproblematically, it also provides \u201can element of exotic spectacle\u201d (Clive Jackson, \nBCC, interview 17.9.97, in Dean, 1997) for both Birmingham\u2019s population and its \nvisitors.   Unlike the \u2018Chinatowns\u2019 of other major cities (Anderson, 1988; 1990; 1991; \nLi, 1994; Olds, 1996; Mitchell, 1997), it is not a major residential area, but was \ndesigned with the intention of using an explicit notion of ethnicity to bring economic \nlife back to part of the decaying inner city. \nChina Court was the first redevelopment project in the Chinese Quarter, begun \nin 1986 to the southeast of the city centre.  It involved the refurbishment of a derelict \nthree-storey warehouse around a \u2018Chinese theme\u2019 to encourage the \u2018Orientalisation\u2019 \nof the Quarter (Jackson, ibid.).  Much of the decoration and detail originates in China \nand the 60,000 pagoda roof tiles were imported from Hong Kong.  All units were let \nto Chinese businesses.  With the development of China Court in place, the plan has \nbeen to continue upgrading the area and attract flows of capital from both local and \noverseas Chinese businesses and property developers.  The phase two extension of the \nChina Court redevelopment scheme was largely financed by Chinese private capital \nand was made the responsibility of the Chinese property developers Anglo-Oriental \nProperties Ltd.  In recent years, the Chinese Quarter has witnessed a certain amount of \ngentrification of its existing buildings, such as the Chung Ying and Chung Yung \nGarden restaurants, in addition to further financial assistance (a \u00a33.2m grant in 1990) \nfrom the City of Birmingham.   \nIn 1998, businessman Wing Yip presented the city of Birmingham with the \nPagoda (see Figure 1).  This gift, shipped from China, acts as a gateway to the \nChinese Quarter and was provided to advertise the presence and importance of the \nChinese community in Birmingham (Chan, 2002 and forthcoming).  Wing Yip was \n 11\nalso involved in the Heartlands regeneration initiative in the north of the city (Deakin \nand Edwards 1993).  This is another area of substantial development, offering \ncommercial activities, business units and facilities for the local Chinese community.  \nWing Yip was first to occupy this area of redevelopment in the early 1990s with a \ncash and carry business and later bought the adjoining land to create opportunities for \nfurther Chinese-owned development. In this instance a \u2018Gateway to Heaven\u2019, again \nbuilt largely from specialist materials imported from China, acts as a boundary marker \nfor the site.  \nThe idea of the Chinese Quarter is clearly fused with the traditional route of \nearly Hong Kong Chinese migrants into the catering industry during the 1950s and \n1960s.  It is estimated that 80% of the Birmingham Chinese are engaged in the food \nindustry (Birmingham City Council, 1996b: 12); this, together with saturated markets \nin Chinese takeaways and restaurants, involves high risk despite the present prosperity \nof the community.  Nevertheless, as the numbers of Chinese people in Birmingham \nand Britain have grown, they have developed their networks of kinship, capital and \ngoods to take in family and business contacts in cities such as London, Manchester \nand Hong Kong, and used these connections to branch out from the restaurant \nbusiness. Anglo-Oriental properties, led by \u2018local\u2019 overseas Chinese businessman \nStephen Sham, has been a key agent in the development of the Chinese Quarter; Wing \nYip\u2019s involvement in property development has been part of his broader move into \nfood production and distribution.   \nThe Wing Yip supermarket is one of Britain\u2019s largest Chinese shopping \ncentres with a workforce of 78, and is part of a successful national chain involving \nstores in London, Edinburgh and Manchester (Keating, 2000).  Stocking these stores \nrequires a considerable import\/export network and Wing Yip\u2019s business draws \n 12\nextensively on linkages with China and its surrounding regions; the business also now \nsupplies Wing Yip branded goods to the main supermarkets.  As Irene Chu of the \nBirmingham Chinese Society explains, most Chinese business people in Birmingham \nhave contacts in South East Asia and import a majority of their goods from this \nregion, especially items such as Chinese foods for retail and wholesale that are not \nproduced in the UK (interview, August 1997, in Dean, 1997).  Thus, the development \nof the Chinese Quarter has been the product of a complex set of networks and \npartnerships involving the local City Council, national government, a number of \nChinese business people and property developers and members of the Chinese \ncommunity. Moreover, this long term process may be contrasted with the rather more \nrecent, and almost overwhelming, interest by (inter)national trade and industry bodies \nin the growth of the Chinese economy. \n Most recently, there has been further immigration from Hong Kong, and \nBirmingham has become a nodal point within new flows of overseas Chinese capital \nand people.  A number of specialist travel agents have opened to service the increased \nflows, while the newly arrived Bank of China serves the local business community in \nChinese dialects, with practices that are based on Hong Kong business customs [3].  If \nanalyses of other contexts are any indication (Redding, 1990; Anderson, 1991; \nSeagrave, 1995; Thrift and Olds, 1996; Weidenbaum and Hughes, 1996; Yeung, \n1998; Yeung and Olds, 2000), the success of Birmingham\u2019s Chinese community is \nbased upon an element of competitive advantage and trust that is derived from \nethnicity and transnational trading links. In turn, as one element of a broadening set of \neconomic activities, the expansion of the economic horizons of Birmingham\u2019s \nChinese business community has created new forms of investment and global linkage \nfor the city. Indeed, in 2004, Birmingham hosted the 12th Annual European \n 13\nConference of Chinese Organisations, which attracted more than 400 delegates not \nonly from across Europe and the rest of the UK but also from China, Singapore, \nMalaysia and the United States [4]. \n \n2. Ethnic food production \nChinese food production is one example of transnational links related to the growth of \nthe ethnic foods industry in Birmingham.  Ethnic food manufacturing for both \nnational and international distribution has grown significantly since the 1990s (see \nAsian Business Directory 2002; Business Register Birmingham, 1997 [5]). This \nphenomenon might be linked to the concentration of \u2018ethnic\u2019 restaurants in the city \nand, more broadly, a growing \u2018institutional thickness\u2019 (Amin and Thrift, 1994).  A \nclimate in which ethnic restaurants thrive is likely to provide a favourable \nenvironment for food production with established support structures made up of \nnetworks of suppliers, business support (e.g. the Asian Business Association, the \nBangladeshi Caterers Association, Asian Balti Restaurant Association), trading links \nand an influx of skilled workers.  Birmingham has also seen a rise in local training \ninitiatives (by the now defunct Training and Enterprise Council) geared towards the \nethnic food sector.  One example is the Balti Business Initiative, which aims to \nencourage local businesses to invest money in the development of the sector [6].  This \nfollows similar initiatives in the local Chinese food industry.  Wing Yip provides \nfunding for a restaurant and full-time work experience placements at the Birmingham \nCollege of Food and Tourism.  This has proved a successful method of encouraging \nnon-Chinese students to acquire the expertise required in the Chinese food \nmanufacturing industry.  The College also has links with East End Foods (see below).  \n 14\nSome commentators, however, are more sceptical about the benefits of ethnic \nenclaves in Birmingham\u2019s food industry.  Afro-Caribbean restaurateurs, for example, \nhave struggled to access finance for their enterprises [7], while in their study of balti \nrestaurants Ram et al. (2000) reject the idea of an ethnic enclave creating economic \nadvantage.  Instead, they argue that the balti industry is marginal and sub-optimal, \nwith restaurateurs in Birmingham constantly undercutting each other through \ncompetition, with the result that individual businesses struggle to make a profit.  \nWhile this is the case with the balti restaurant business, other food networks in \nBirmingham present a somewhat different picture.  These tend to be less visible and \nless consumer-oriented than the balti industry, with more room for manoeuvre and \ninnovation.  Some have been, effectively, \u2018market makers\u2019 because of their \ntransnational linkages.  \nOne example is East End Foods, a family-run grocery wholesaling and cash \nand carry operation set up in 1972 and now one of the UK\u2019s largest \nimporters\/exporters of Indian foods, including pulses, rice, lentils, peas, beans, spices, \nchutneys and pickles (Ind, 1998).  The company, housed in large premises at Digbeth \nand Smethwick, employs 130 people and had a turnover of \u00a390m in 2003-4 [8]. In \n2004, it was ranked 91st in the UK\u2019s \u2018Top 100\u2019 firms in the manufacture of food \nproducts and beverages [9]. It began as a small grocery shop selling to both Asian and \nEuropean customers, using a small amount of personal capital and extensive credit \nfrom Asian suppliers.  It specialised initially in Indian products but soon expanded \ninto a wide range of other foods. It now imports and packs over 500 products and has \nover 1150 lines in Indian food products [10]. The company has recently received \nplaudits for its export performance, selling \u00a35m of goods to the EU in 2003-4 and \n 15\nexpecting 40 per cent export growth in 2004-5. As the UK Government\u2019s Europe \nMinister Dennis MacShane put it recently, \ninnovators like East End Foods are carving out niches for themselves in the \nEuropean Single Market. I\u2019m delighted to learn that they are exporting some \nBritish diversity to the continent [11].  \nThe company sources from as far away as Australia and New Zealand and exports \nbeyond the EU to Canada and the USA. \nThe success of East End Foods is due largely to its early involvement in \ncanning small amounts of Asian foods, imported from India and sold under its own \nlabel, which expanded as demand grew from supermarkets for a range of \u2018ethnic\u2019 \nproducts. It is also rooted in transnational networks (in this case trade links back to \nIndia, with the diasporic Indian\/Sikh community, and through connections with \nfamilies and friends) and knowledge of cultures required to develop niche products, \nwhich have allowed it to capture a significant part of the ethnic foods business.  The \ncanning venture was highly successful and the range and quality of own label \nproducts have expanded to the point where it now accounts for about a third of total \nturnover.  Another factor in its favour was the expansion of both Asian-owned retail \noutlets and the wider European market.  The cash and carry operation was added to \nthe wholesaling business in order to accommodate smaller retail customers.  The main \nmarket for their Asian foodstuffs, however, is large supermarket multiples in the UK \nand Europe.   \n Further examples of Birmingham\u2019s growing and successful food \nmanufacturing industry include Wine and Dine, which supplies 40% of the UK retail \nchilled salad dressings market.  This was originally a Greek restaurant that started \nmaking dishes and dips in response to customer demand.  It now concentrates on \n 16\nmanufacturing, employs a workforce of nearly 100 people, and its turnover increased \nfrom \u00a32.9 million in 1996 to \u00a36 million in 1999 (Birmingham Voice, 1999b).  Sunrise \nBakery in Smethwick is a family-run West Indian food processing and manufacturing \nenterprise, supplying customers in the Midlands, the North, Greater London and the \nSouth East since the 1970s.  Other emerging food producers in Birmingham include \nSpice Time (producers of fresh and frozen ready meals), Eastern Foods (nan and pitta \nbread makers), King Spice, Cleone Foods (manufacturers of Caribbean savoury \npatties and included from 2002 in the UK Inner City 100 list of the country\u2019s fastest \ngrowing companies [12]),  Chocolate Temptations, BABA enterprises (the UK\u2019s \nlargest manufacturer of fresh poppadums), Bakes (a specialist in Caribbean sweet \nbreads and snacks), Raja Frozen Foods, Euro Ice Cream (creators of the world\u2019s \nlargest balti ice cream range) and Giro Foods (importers of exotic spices and \ningredients).   \n Many of these businesses are family-owned with a largely self-employed \nworkforce.  They are also relatively small, employing less than 20 people.  Food \nmanufacturers in Birmingham use their knowledge of the consumption patterns of \ntheir own ethnic group, coupled with familial and community-based support \nstructures, to manufacture a product aimed at a niche market - either people within \nthat ethnic group or the increasing numbers of people sampling foods from outside \ntheir own culture.  The industry is also characterised by high levels of innovation.  A \nlarge number of businesses in Birmingham supply speciality foods, such as Indian \nsweets for weddings, or halal Chinese and baby foods.  In addition, as the example of \nEast End Foods demonstrates, recent years have witnessed expansion of \nmanufacturing to supply British and European supermarkets with ethnic foods, \nparticularly in the form of Indian ready meals.  In this case, the speciality foods are \n 17\ntailored more to European tastes (Financial Times Food Business, July 1998).  Thus, \nwhere Pakistani and Indian restaurants have failed to establish a foothold, the \navailability of ethnic foods in European supermarkets is likely to pave the way for an \nincreased demand for ethnic food more broadly.  This will increase the opportunity \nfor ethnic food manufacturers in Birmingham to export internationally.  Ethnic food \nmanufacturers are also likely to have competitive advantage as they make use of \ntransnational and local trade links, overcoming barriers to trade by building on \nrelationships based on a combination of family, ethnic and other business ties (see \nBates, 1985; Mitchell, 1993).  These transnational linkages have helped to establish \nBirmingham as \u2018a world-class centre of excellence for ethnic food production\u2019 (Paul \nSpooner, Director of Economic Development, Birmingham Voice, 2000: 3). \n \n3. The Bhangra music industry \nBirmingham\u2019s Bhangra music industry is another example of economic \ntransnationalism that informs a re-visioning of Birmingham\u2019s economy.  Recent years \nhave produced a great deal of critical writing about the cultural politics of music and, \nparticularly, the consumption of different musical styles.  Indeed, music has been seen \nas a site where racialised power relations are played out against a backdrop of \nexploitation and appropriation (Jackson, 1989; Burnett, 1996).  Focusing on \nproduction within the music industry, particularly in cities like Birmingham, allows a \nrather different story to be told: one of innovation, fusion and transnationalism.  The \nmusic industry in Birmingham is significant because of the prominence within it of \npeople from minority ethnic groups.  If there has been a \u201cserious dearth of insightful \nwriting into the long history of the involvement of British Asians in musical cultures\u201d \n 18\n(Back, 1996: 227-8), there is perhaps even less written about their involvement in the \nproduction side of the music industry. \n Bhangra is part of vibrant Black music cultures and is inseparable from the \nlocal multicultural urban spaces that provide the crucial context for the formation of \nits sounds.  It is therefore very different to so-called \u2018World Music\u2019, which is accused \nof the objectification, categorisation and appropriation of \u2018exotic\u2019 musical forms by \nthe white middle classes.  British Bhangra developed out of the more traditional forms \nof folk dances and music of the people of the Punjab, arriving in Britain in the late \n1960s with migration from South Asia and East Africa.  It emerged in the mid-1980s \namong second generation South Asian-British musicians, primarily in Birmingham \nand west London.  It combines the robust and energetic punctuated rhythms of \ndouble-sided drums (dhol, later replaced by tumbi and dholak), modern technology \nand urban sounds with Punjabi poetry, traditional Punjabi lyrics, acrobatic dance \nskills and celebrations of the Punjabi harvest festival (bhaisakhi). In the 1980s, it \nplayed an important role in proclaiming a cultural identity for groups of youths \ndefining themselves as South Asian-British.  Throughout the 1990s, Bhangra was \ncharacterised by ongoing processes of fusion with broader ranges of musical styles \n(ragga, reggae, rap, soul, jazzfunk, rock, hip-hop, pop), both to reflect the lived \nexperiences of South Asian-Britons in the 1990s, and as an attempt to \u2018cross-over\u2019 \ninto mainstream charts.  It is also the antecedent to newer and more fashionable forms \nof post-Bhangra and \u2018Asian Kool\u2019, which have been less marginalized by mainstream \nculture and are part of an emergent and vibrant British-Asian urban youth culture. \n Although numerous British South Asians enjoy this music genre in other cities \n(especially London), Birmingham is by far the cultural capital for Bhangra music \n(Kumar, 1998) and is claimed to be responsible for producing almost 90 per cent of \n 19\nthe UK\u2019s Bhangra music [13]. The city is home to internationally renowned groups \nand artists such as Bhujangy, Safri Boys, Apna Group (formerly Apna Sangeet), \nApache Indian and Malkit Singh and to several major recording and distribution \ncompanies. Among these is Oriental Star Agency, established in the 1970s in Moseley \n(see Figure 1) and home to internationally renowned singers such as Bally Sagoo and \nUstad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, both of whom featured in a recent Sunday Times list of \nthe Greatest 100 musicians of all time [14]. Another example is Moviebox, which \nbegan as a video-audio rental store in Small Heath in 1985, importing and exporting \nmusic to and from India and Pakistan and becoming a major distributor and \nwholesaler of Asian music in the UK. In 1995, the Moviebox record label was \nlaunched, now home to Band Baja Boys and B21 [15]. Other production companies \ninclude Nachural records (established in 1991 in Moseley), Hi-Tech (Smethwick), \nMusic World\/Rainbow (Handsworth) and Mega Music (previously owned by Roma, \nHandsworth).  These companies and artists like Bally Sagoo and Malkit Singh have \nreceived international exposure through popular films like Bend it Like Beckham \n(2002) and their associated soundtracks. \nBirmingham is also the centre for a steady production of new albums and a \ngrowing number of live DJs.  Recent years have seen the emergence of newer bands \nsuch as D\/I\/P, XLNC, Achanak, Ahista, Anakhi, East-West Connection and Avtar \nManiac, all signed to Nachural, and B21, DCS, Pardesi, Golden Star and Midland \nBoyz.  Birmingham-based artists like Malkit Singh have achieved popularity in Asia, \nCanada, the US and UK, even reaching the Indian community in Australia (Mitchell, \n1996: 61).  In addition, the city is home to several nationally and internationally \nrenowned composers and producers, one of the most prominent being Harjinder \nBoparai.  Boparai has produced albums by many Birmingham Bhangra artists \n 20\nincluding Safri Boys, Apache Indian, Anakhi and Malkit Singh.  In 1996, he signed a \npublishing deal with Warner Chappell Music and formally set up his own music \nproduction company, HSB Productions.  To date, he has composed title and incidental \nmusic for 26 BBC, independent and Sky Digital television series, including Network \nEast, East, Bollywood or Bust, Asia 2, Flavours of India, Safe TV and Big Talk, and \nseveral national and regional BBC Radio stations.  His work is also international; he \nhas produced music for Canadian television and radio and in 1999 visited Singapore \nto establish projects there for HSB Productions [16].  \nKumar (1998: 20-21) has argued that such a collection of artists, musical \ntalent and production expertise, as well as the increasing live performance of British \nBhangra at gigs and private celebratory parties, helps to constitute a unique form of \ncultural production and music industry in Birmingham.  Despite huge sales of \nrelatively cheaply priced music and significant transnational flows of imports and \nexports most Bhangra remains relatively marginalized within the broader music \nindustry, being virtually ignored (or stereotyped) by the mainstream music press and \nhandicapped by poor retail and distribution.  The economic infrastructure is still full \nof contradictions (Banerji and Baumann, 1990: 148).  The musicians themselves often \nproduce the albums and large parts of the industry are still quite amateurish (Kumar \n1998).  One alternative is to produce in India, as Malkit Singh has done with his \nHandsworth-based band Golden Star, allowing them to succeed in capturing \nenthusiastic audiences with Indian productions in both the UK and the sub-continent.  \nIn addition, Singh has been instrumental in arguing for greater capital injections into \nthe industry in order to maintain quality.  Although this means higher retail prices \n(Singh\u2019s first 15 albums all sold for \u00a32.50, then at \u00a34.00 and his latest in 2003 at \u00a310), \nincreasingly producers and artists are recognising the need for increased injections of \n 21\nfinance [17].  Furthermore, Birmingham City Council has suggested that the \nHandsworth area (see Figure 1) could be recognised as a Punjabi cultural region with \nproper support for local businesses, including the music industry (Birmingham City \nCouncil, 1996: 59). \nPiracy remains a major obstacle to Bhangra musicians turning professional.  In \naddition, live DJs are now more popular than live bands at weddings and club \nfunctions because of cost, and this has considerable impacts on bands, in some cases \ndeterring new talent (Boparai, pers. comm.).  However, clearly many bands do \nprofessionalize successfully and become major international performers.  \nBirmingham-based Apache Indian (aka Steven Kapur) was the first South Asian \nBritish musician to break into the mainstream UK charts in 1993; he is now an \ninternational star.  Although he does not claim to be a Bhangra singer, Apache\u2019s \nmusic combines ragga, rap and reggae with Bhangra and pop; his music epitomises \nthe hybrid nature of the fusion musical scene in Birmingham, and symbolizes the \ndynamic culture of the city (see Back and Nayak, 1993) and the transnational links \nthat underpin many of its cultural industries.  \nThe Birmingham Bhangra scene is a highly integrated trading community with \na strong support network.  The importance of transnational networks in the success of \nthe Bhangra industry are epitomised by Birmingham producer Bally Sagoo, who \nremixes Bombay film music using Western sampling and remixing technologies.  \nThis is distributed to Western audiences and those in the sub-continent through a deal \nwith distribution giants, Sony.  As Sharma (1996: 27) argues, the increasing \navailability of this Western-produced Bombay music in South Asia through satellite \nand record deals is promoting new forms of musical cultures in India, which in turn is \nhaving an impact upon the Asian urban music in the West.  Bhangra is thus a hybrid \n 22\nmusical form that positions Birmingham within transnational cultural and economic \nnetworks. Furthermore, evidence suggests that this cultural industry is expanding \nmore widely into various forms of media. For example, Asia 1 TV studios in \nBirmingham is a digital television channel aimed at the Punjabi speaking \ncommunities of Europe and is in partnership with ANI\/Reuters in Delhi and Star \n(India), B-Sky-B\u2019s sister company (Birmingham Voice, 1999a).  \n \nProblematizing transnationalism \nThere are, of course, dangers inherent in valorising and celebrating uncritically \nethnicity and hybridity, and of being too optimistic about the possibilities of economic \ntransnationalism against the backdrop of the polarising effects of global capitalism.  \nAs Sharma (1996: 29) argues, the promotion of British Asians like Bally Sagoo by \nglobal giants such as Sony exemplifies the privileging of migrancy in postcolonial \ndiscourses by global capitalism: \nThe recent turn, in the avant-garde sectors of the Western academy, to the \nstudy of marginal culture, has failed to engage adequately with the oppressive \ndynamics of this mode of reorganised capitalism\u2026 [T]he project of \ncelebrating hybrid \u2018ethnic\u2019 cultures obscures the epistemic violence of \nWestern intellectual knowledge\u2026, reduces \u2018Other\u2019 cultures to essentialist and \n\u2018traditional\u2019 fixities \u2013 as \u2018victims\u2019 of progress, as objects of tourism, as the \nlabour of migration and the colours of multiculturalism \u2013 and then valorizes \nhybridity as their encounter with the emancipated West. \nClearly, the success of Birmingham\u2019s overseas Chinese business community, or the \nvibrancy of its \u2018ethnic foods\u2019 industry, or the brilliance and skill of Punjabi producers \nand musicians in securing space for themselves within popular culture should not \n 23\nblind us to the harsh realities facing immigrants all over the world (Lipsitz, 1997).  \nCertainly, much of Birmingham\u2019s multi-ethnic economy is still characterised by low \nwages, poor working conditions, and racism.  People of different ethnicity working \nwithin the same sector very often have different experiences.  For example, \nSmallbone et al. (2001) have explored the relative difficulties that African Caribbean \nrestaurateurs face in accessing finance and business support in comparison with \nChinese and white restaurateurs.  Nor should the different experiences of people from \nwithin the same minority ethnic group, based on such factors as class and gender, be \nhomogenised.  The realities of living in Birmingham are likely to be very different, \nfor example, between wealthy Chinese property developers and those serving in fast-\nfood restaurants.  Moreover, transnationalism can exacerbate the already intense \ncompetitive pressures that, for example, Asian clothing manufacturers face, which \ncould have the effect of increasing reliance on less formal working practices. \nIn reconceptualizing Birmingham\u2019s economy we need to be wary of over-\nprivileging diaspora, migrancy and hybridity, since this encounter of \u2018Third World\u2019 \ncultures with the West becomes the framework through which \u2018non-Western\u2019 cultures \nare interpreted.  Hybrid ethnic cultures are valorised and celebrated, but this further \nmarginalizes \u2018traditional cultures\u2019, the colonial encounter remains privileged and the \nglobal domain of cultural capital remains unchallenged.  It is widely acknowledged \nthat racism is still a barrier to employment in Britain, resulting in high rates of self-\nemployment amongst minority ethnic groups (Metcalf et al., 1996, Mason 2003).  \nMinority ethnic groups in Birmingham experience greater problems of access to \nquality jobs and need special support in business ventures; they are also more exposed \nto unemployment and low wages (Killeen, 1999) [18].  \n 24\nIt should also be remembered that migration and experiences of \ntransnationalism are deeply embedded in gender relations. As Salih (2000) argues, \naccess to global mobility is gendered, yet in recent literature on transnationalism there \nis a tendency to ignore the ways in which nation-states and global economic \nrestructuring are operating in gendered ways (cf. Willis and Yeoh, 2000; Fouron and \nSchiller, 2001; Robins and Aksoy, 2001).  Transnational spheres are not only \ncontingent upon the vulnerability of migrants within global economic systems, but are \ninscribed in specific cultural and normative constraints that often work to disempower \nwomen.  It is perhaps ironic, therefore, given these problems and the fact that \neconomic transnationalism is often a response to obstacles to socio-economic \nintegration, that the diversity of Birmingham\u2019s population and their position within \ntransnational networks could be an important element in its economic future. \n  \nConclusions \nThis paper has attempted to provide a relational understanding of Birmingham as a \ncity with a multi-ethnic population that has long established linkages with worlds \noutside the city\u2019s boundaries (Smith, 2001). This relational perspective also shifts \nemphasis away from bounded notions of space that feature prominently in much of \nthe \u2018ethnic entrepreneurialism\u2019 literatures. The networks we have highlighted in \nBirmingham - Chinese business networks, ethnic foods and Bhangra music industries \n- illustrate three things.  First, forms of capital investment, like labour, are \n(multi)cultural and may have specific culturally informed outcomes.  Second, a key \nelement of the investment strategies of certain forms of (multicultural) capital is the \n\u2018diaspora\u2019; in other words, investment through transnational ethnic community-based \nnetworks and feedback into the source community, which provides both knowledge \n 25\nand expertise and a market for the produce in advanced market economies.  \nBirmingham, as a multicultural city, is one such meeting place of the global \ndiaspora(s).  Third, the cultural domain is highly significant in understanding \nconnections between the local and the global and in uncovering forms of agency that \nare usually ignored in traditional economic narratives of global cities, in general, and \nBirmingham\u2019s regeneration, in particular.  Thus if we take seriously the arguments of \nSmith (2001) and Ley (2004), Birmingham is a distinctive global city, but this \ndistinctiveness is not based on its recent and very substantial development of prestige \nurban regeneration projects or even its marketing slogan as \u2018The Meeting Place of \nEurope\u2019. Rather, its global distinctiveness is, in part, based on its residents\u2019 diasporic \nand transnational (economic) roots, which extend across Europe into Asia and the \nPacific Rim. \nThe question remains, however, is it possible to create competitive advantage \nthat is less exclusionary and that translates into material gain for working class and \nminority ethnic communities?  Questions such as these are of critical importance to a \nmulticultural and post-colonial city such as Birmingham, still struggling against the \nsocial and economic effects of the restructuring of its manufacturing industries.  The \ncity\u2019s multiculturalism and its position within post-colonial and transnational \neconomic networks are rapidly being recognised as a crucial element of continued \neconomic development.  The City Council has been at the centre of the construction \nof the Chinese Quarter in the Hurst Street area and a proposed Balti Quarter in \nSparkbrook\/Sparkhill.  Similarly, a number of ethnic community forums have been \ndeveloped inclusive of Economic Development Officers.  Such initiatives reflect the \nfirst explicit statement on multicultural economic development in the City Council\u2019s \nEconomic Strategy Vision Document in 1998 and, in early 2000 the city appointed its \n 26\nfirst development manager for African Caribbean businesses.  Nevertheless, a number \nof concerns remain. First, there is the potential for such policy initiatives to create \nparticular, and fixed, versions of ethnicity and multiculturalism. Second, how is \npolicy to deal with the oft-cited reluctance of minority ethnic businesses to use or \nengage with mainstream avenues of business support (Ram and Smallbone, 2002)? \nThird, as we have suggested, and as the work of Ram et al. (2000) illustrates, there is \nnothing to suggest that ethnic minority enterprises are not subject to class and gender \nexploitation. It is important, therefore, in recognising the significance of minority \nethnic networks to a relational conceptualisation of city economies to retain a critical \neye on their working practices. \nThere is a pressing need for further research that examines how transnational \nnetworks might produce distinctive competitive advantage for different cities and \nregions (as they continue to \u2018go global\u2019) in a way that could combat the social and \neconomic polarisation that has accompanied mainstream neo-liberal forms of \neconomic development.  In other words, under what conditions do such transnational \nnetworks facilitate progressive socio-economic change as opposed to locking \nindividuals into ethnic enclaves that are subject to exploitation, racism and exclusion? \nWhat are the possibilities of, and constraints facing, these networks as empowering \nsources of social action and capital? Recent research is beginning to tease out some of \nthese issues by following specific commodity networks, such as Asian fashion and \nfoods, and their circuitry in other contexts (for example, Hardill and Raghuram, 1998; \nCrang et al., 2000, 2003; Dwyer and Jackson, 2003; Werbner, 1999, 2001; see also \nCook 2003). For Werbner (1999, 548), the focus on the commodity is a political \nstrategy that allows us to \u201cmove away from invidious stereotypes of different ethnic \ngroups\u201d and their cultures.   Theoretically, exploring such commodities and the \n 27\nnetworks through which they flow is another way of thinking relationally about \nmulticultural cities and their insertion into the \u2018national\/global\u2019 economy (Allen et al., \n1998). \n Cities such as Birmingham would benefit from embracing more fully the \nnotion of multicultural economic development.  This is about recognising the cultural \ndiversity of economic activity in policy terms and encouraging it in the expectation \nthat such diversity brings with it a broadening of the economic base.  To this end, \nBirmingham has a rich and distinctive cultural base upon which to draw.  The precise \ncontribution of these networks to the city\u2019s economic base is still a matter of \nconjecture, but our research into examples of economic transnationalism within the \ncity reveals how diversity might be mobilised \u201cas a source of both social cohesion and \nurban economic competitiveness\u201d (Amin, 1997: 134).  Far from being a post-\nindustrial city whose glories as \u2018the workshop of the world\u2019 have long since faded, \nBirmingham is a working example of multicultural economic development and a city \nthat is constituted through transnational networks and flows.  With foresight and \nprogressive policies aimed at recognising and supporting this, Birmingham could yet \nbecome one of the \u2018post-colonial workshops of the world\u2019. \n \n 28\nReferences \nAlbrow, M.

However, Khadria\u2019s (1999) study of \nIndian knowledge workers migrating to the US discusses positive effects of this \nmigration, with transnational links and cooperation producing human development-\nled growth of \u2018human capital\u2019 in the country of origin. This return of human capital \ncan be thought of as a \u2018second-generation\u2019 effect of a \u2018brain drain\u2019. \n[2] For an excellent review of this literature see Ram and Jones (1998). \n[3] Bound up with these connections (but more difficult to trace) is the extent to \nwhich they mean that Chinese people in Birmingham place themselves in a \ntransnational Chinese imaginary. As Dean (1997: 39) argues, while individuals have \ntheir own relation to this, the public discourse of Chinese business people has been \nkeen to strategically draw upon the idea of the Chinese as successful transnational \ncitizens in a way that reflects their own position as a highly mobile group maintaining \nstrong connections with other Chinese transnationals. \n[4] http:\/\/www.minority4business.co.uk\/connews.asp?renleewtsapf=1171, accessed 1 \nOctober 2004. \n[5] Business Register Birmingham (1997) lists 18 food manufacturing and wholesale \ncompanies specialising in products ranging from frozen baltis, pickled fruit, bread, \nhalal foods and sweets.
