INTRODUCTION\nGraphene, the two-dimensional arrangement of carbon at-\noms on a honeycomb lattice, which has recently become\navailable through groundbreaking fabrication methods,1,2\npossesses a wide range of unique electronic transport prop-\nerties, which originate from the conical dispersion relation\naround the corners \u0001K points\u0002 of the hexagonal Brillouin\nzone.3 The low-energy theory in the vicinity of these points\nis of the form of a Dirac equation for massless chiral fer-\nmions.4 The intrinsic transport properties studied on the basis\nof the Dirac equation \u0001such as the quantum Hall effect,5\u20138 the\nminimal conductivity,5,7,9\u201318 and weak localization correc-\ntions to the conductance19\u201324\u0002 therefore effectively probe the\ngraphene band structure via the momentum difference \u0002k\nrelative to the K points. On the other hand, detailed informa-\ntion corroborating the conical band structure in the absolute\nk space has recently become accessible via angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy.25,26\nRecent theoretical transport studies have pointed out that\nhighly unconventional devices could be fabricated in pat-\nterned and gated samples of graphene, such as Veselago\nlenses27 and filters for the valley degree of freedom.28 These\neffects already occur in simple rectangular graphitic samples,\nso-called nanoribbons, which have been studied in great de-\ntail in the past.29\u201337 With few exceptions, however, theoreti-\ncal investigations of electronic transport have concentrated\non all-graphitic structures. In experiments, the ultimate elec-\ntronic contacts are metallic \u0001for illustration, see, e.g., Ref.\n38\u0002. Two recent works39,40 have addressed the coupling\nof graphene to normal-conducting electrodes, in each case\nconsidering normal-conductor\/graphene\/normal-conductor\n\u0001NGN\u0002 junctions with an armchair ribbon and zigzag inter-\nfaces, as shown in Fig. 1\u0001a\u0002. In Ref. 39, the graphitic part\nwas fixed at the value of charge-neutral graphene, while the\non-site potential in the leads was changed \u0001the results were\nthen compared to the results for a setup in which the leads\nare also graphitic13\u0002. In Ref. 40, the on-site potential in all\nthree regions was changed simultaneously \u0001the resulting fi-\nnite charge-carrier density in the graphitic part greatly en-\nhances the conductance of the junction\u0002.\nIn this paper, we systematically investigate the depen-\ndence of the electronic transport through NGN junctions on\nindependent on-site potentials in the leads and in the gra-\nphitic region. Since the transport at finite charge-carrier den-\nsity is anisotropic and depends on the details of the normal\nelectrodes, we also consider the case of zigzag ribbons with\narmchair interfaces \u0003Figs. 1\u0001c\u0002 and 1\u0001d\u0002\u0004 and the case of real-\nspace leads \u0003Figs. 1\u0001b\u0002 and 1\u0001d\u0002\u0004. We also investigate how\nthe conductance depends on bulk disorder, boundary rough-\nness, and interface imperfection.\nOur results entail that a ballistic NGN junction can be\ninsulating even when the charge-carrier densities in the leads\nand in the graphitic region are both finite. Conceptually, this\neffect can be seen as the counterpart of the celebrated mini-\nmal nonvanishing conductivity exhibited by a graphene sheet\nat the point of nominally vanishing charge-carrier den-\nsity.5,7,9\u201318\nWe identify a simple mechanism for this insulating behav-\nior at finite charge-carrier density, which originates in the\nmismatch of propagating modes in the normal and graphitic\nparts of the system. In the transport across a ballistic inter-\nface, the transverse momentum is conserved \u0001modulo re-\nciprocal-lattice vectors\u0002, and the conductance probes whether\nthere are propagating modes with the same transverse mo-\nmentum on both sides of the interface. The conductance\nthresholds, hence, are intimately related to the band structure\nin the normal and graphitic parts of the junction, which re-\nstricts the transverse momenta of propagating modes. Con-\nsequently, the conductance thresholds could be used to de-\nliver information on the band structure of graphene in\nabsolute k space if the band structure in the leads is known.\nOur numerical computations show that the insulating behav-\nior persists for moderate levels of bulk, edge, or interface\ndisorder and is only destroyed for a very rough interface. The\npracticality of fabricating sufficiently clean graphene ribbons\nhas been demonstrated in recent experiments.41 In other me-\nsoscopic systems, the fabrication and characterization of\nclean ballistic interfaces have reached a high level of so-\nphistication.42\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section II provides\nbackground information on the tight-binding models used to\nmodel the NGN junctions and on the propagating and eva-\nnescent modes in the normal and graphitic parts of the sys-\ntem. Section III presents numerical results for clean junctions\nand identifies regions of insulating behavior at finite charge-\nPHYSICAL REVIEW B 76, 115430 \u00012007\u0002\n1098-0121\/2007\/76\u000111\u0002\/115430\u000111\u0002 \u00a92007 The American Physical Society115430-1\ncarrier density. Analytical results are given in Sec. IV. We\nstart with an exact calculation of the conductance for the case\nof armchair ribbons with zigzag interfaces and lattice-\nmatched leads, shown in Fig. 1\u0001a\u0002. The results allow us to\nidentify the simple mechanism for the insulating behavior\ndescribed above, which can be carried over to the other ge-\nometries in Fig. 1. In Sec. V, we discuss the effects of bulk,\nedge, and interface disorders, as well as the effect of mode\nmixing at armchair interfaces. Conclusions are presented in\nSec. VI.

THEORETICAL BACKGROUND\nIn this section, we provide the theoretical background for\nthe analytic calculations and numerical computations of the\nconductance of NGN junctions, which are based on tight-\nbinding models and the Landauer conductance formula.\nA.

The tight-binding Hamiltonian is given by\nH = \u0005\ni\nVici\n\u2020ci \u2212 \u0005\n\u0006ij\u0007\n\u0003ijci\n\u2020cj , \u00011\u0002\nwhere ci is a fermionic annihilation operator acting on lattice\nsite i, \u0006ij\u0007 denotes pairs of nearest neighbors, and the hop-\nping matrix elements \u0003ij as well as the on-site potential en-\nergies Vi take values as appropriate for the region in ques-\ntion.\nThe graphitic region is modeled by sites on a honeycomb\nlattice with lattice constant a\u0001G\u0002, hopping constant \u0003\u0001G\u0002, and\non-site potential V\u0001G\u0002. The normal regions N\u0001r\u0002 \u0001r=1,2, cor-\nresponding to the left and right leads, respectively\u0002 are mod-\neled as sites on a square lattice with lattice constant a\u0001r\u0002,\nhopping constant \u0003\u0001r\u0002, and on-site potential V\u0001r\u0002.\nIn order to form a NGN junction, a graphitic region of\nlength L is matched to the normal regions along graphitic\nzigzag \u0003Figs. 1\u0001a\u0002 and 1\u0001b\u0002\u0004 or armchair \u0003Figs. 1\u0001c\u0002 and 1\u0001d\u0002\u0004\ninterfaces of width W.

Figures\n1\u0001b\u0002 and 1\u0001d\u0002 show real-space leads, approximated by a finer\nlattice with a reduced lattice constant. The hopping constants\nacross the right and left interfaces are denoted by \u0003\u00011G\u0002 and\n\u0003\u00012G\u0002, respectively.\nB. Landauer conductance formula\nFor small bias voltages, the phase-coherent conductance\nof a mesoscopic structure is given by the Landauer formula\ng = \u00012e2\/h\u0002tr t\u2020t , \u00012\u0002\nwhere t is the transmission matrix with elements tnm.

The remainder of this background\nsection compares the properties of these modes in the normal\nand graphitic parts of the NGN junctions.\nC. Dispersion relations\nThe properties of the modes in the normal and graphitic\nregions follow from the dispersion relations, which relate the\nwave number k= \u0001kx ,ky\u0002 to the energy E\u0001k\u0002 of Bloch waves\nand reflect the symmetry properties of the underlying lattice\nstructure.\nThe unit cell of the hexagonal lattice contains two in-\nequivalent sites A and B with different orientations of the\nbonds.

ANALYTICAL RESULTS\nMost of the conductance thresholds observed in the nu-\nmerical computations \u0001Fig. 3\u0002 can be explained via a simple\nmechanism based on the mismatch of propagating modes on\nboth sides of a NG interface. We start our considerations\nwith the exact calculation of the conductance of ballistic\nNGN junctions with zigzag interfaces and latticed-matched\nleads \u0003Fig. 1\u0001a\u0002\u0004. The calculation shows that, in this case, the\ninsulating regions correspond to conditions where the propa-\ngating modes in the normal leads only couple to evanescent\nmodes in the graphitic scattering region. This observation is\nthen carried over as a criterion to calculate conductance\nthresholds for the other three types of NGN junctions.\nA.

Conductance thresholds in large ballistic\nnormal-conductor\/graphene\/normal-conductor\njunctions due to mode mismatch\nFor a long graphitic region, with L\fa\u0001G\u0002, a transmission\ncoefficient \u0003Eq. \u000110\u0002\u0004 tends to zero when the propagating\nmode in the lead couples to an evanescent mode in the gra-\nphitic region \u0001i.e., if Im k\nx\n\u0001G\u0002\u00010\u0002. The conductance \u0003Eq. \u00012\u0002\u0004\nof the junction is small if this is the case for all transmission\ncoefficients. A small conductance, hence, does not necessi-\ntate that all the modes in the graphitic region are\nevanescent\u2014it suffices that the propagating modes in the\ngraphitic region do not couple to the propagating modes in\nthe leads. Consequently, the conductance can be small even\nwhen the charge-carrier density both in the graphitic region\nas well as in the normal leads is finite. We now apply this\nmode-mismatch mechanism to calculate conduction thresh-\nolds of long and wide ballistic NGN junctions with clean\ninterfaces, covering all of the geometries shown in Fig. 1.\nThe requirement of a wide junction arises from the fact\nthat the mechanism described above relies on the conserva-\ntion of transverse momentum \u0001modulo reciprocal-lattice vec-\ntors\u0002. For a clean zigzag interface, this conservation law is\nexact. As discussed in Appendix A, for an armchair interface,\nthe quantized transverse momenta in the graphitic part \u0003Eq.\n\u0001A3\u0002\u0004 differ from the quantized transverse momenta in the\nnormal leads \u0003Eq. \u0001A2\u0002\u0004.

Moreover,\ndetails of the transverse-momentum quantization in graphene\nribbons depend on the chemistry of the edges.46\u201348 In wide\njunctions, the modes in N and G are tightly spaced and can\nELECTRONIC TRANSPORT IN NORMAL-\u2026 PHYSICAL REVIEW B 76, 115430 \u00012007\u0002\n115430-5\nbe assumed to be quasicontinuous. In the limit W\u2192\r, the\ntransverse wave number ky is then conserved exactly, also for\narmchair interfaces.\nThe requirement of a long, ballistic NGN junction is\nneeded so that we can use the assumption that the evanescent\nmodes only give negligible contributions to the conductance,\nas explained in more detail below. \u0001The effects of disorder\nare discussed in Sec. V.\u0002\nUnder these conditions, good conduction requires values\nof the on-site potentials V\u0001G\u0002 and V\u0001r\u0002 at which one finds\ntransverse momenta, possibly differing by reciprocal-lattice\nvectors, for which the associated modes in N and G are both\npropagating. The conductance is always small when this cri-\nterion is not fulfilled. The threshold values of the on-site\npotentials separating the regions of matching and mismatch-\ning propagating modes can be derived from Eqs. \u00018a\u0002\u2013\u00018c\u0002.\nFor the arrangement in Fig. 1\u0001a\u0002, the conductance thresh-\nold due to mode mismatch has two branches given by\nV\u0001r\u0002\n\u0003\u0001r\u0002\n= \f \nV\u0001G\u0002\n\n\u0003\u0001G\u0002\n+ 1\r2, \u000112a\u0002\nV\u0001r\u0002\n\u0003\u0001r\u0002\n= \f \nV\u0001G\u0002\n\n\u0003\u0001G\u0002\n\u2212 1\r2 \u2212 4. \u000112b\u0002\nFor a finer discretization of the square lattice as in Fig.\n1\u0001b\u0002, the first branch remains within the region of the para-\nbolic dispersion at the bottom of the band, while the second\nbranch shifts to V\u0001r\u0002\u2192\u2212\r.

This can be understood from the obser-\nvation that in graphene with armchair interfaces, one can find\npropagating modes with ky\u000e0 for all values of the on-site\npotential V\u0001G\u0002 \u0001see Fig. 2\u0002.\nFigure 4 shows the conductance thresholds due to mode\nmismatch in the V\u0001G\u0002-V\u0001r\u0002 plane. Each panel corresponds to\none of the various types of NGN junctions shown in Fig. 1.\nA comparison with Fig. 3 shows that for zigzag interfaces\n\u0003panels \u0001a\u0002 and \u0001b\u0002\u0004, the mode-mismatch mechanism explains\nall conductance thresholds. For armchair interfaces, the\nmode-mismatch mechanism explains the conductance thresh-\nolds in the left part of panel \u0001c\u0002, corresponding to energies\nclose to the top of the band in the leads. The numerical\nresults in Figs. 3\u0001c\u0002 and 3\u0001d\u0002 exhibit additional thresholds in\nthe lower-right corner of the V\u0001r\u0002-V\u0001G\u0002 plane, corresponding\nto the bottom of the conduction band in the leads and to the\ntop of the conduction band in the graphitic part of the sys-\ntem. Here, the propagating modes on both sides of the inter-\nface differ drastically in their longitudinal wave number \u0001and\nhence in their self-energy\u0002, which also inhibits their\ncoupling.39 Consequently, the conductance of a ballistic\nNGN junction can be small even for conditions not described\nby the simple mode-mismatch mechanism.\nC. Sharpness of thresholds\nAbove, we have ignored the contribution of evanescent\nmodes in graphene. These modes become important for a\nfinite system size L and determine the sharpness of the con-\nductance thresholds.\nThe role of the evanescent modes is best understood by\nconsidering the most slowly decaying modes in the graphitic\nregion and, in particular, by investigating which of these\nmodes still couple to propagating modes in the leads when\none enters the insulating regime. It comes in handy that the\nmost slowly decaying modes have transverse wave numbers\njust at the threshold to where such modes become propagat-\ning, which is determined by Eqs. \u00018a\u0002\u2013\u00018c\u0002. Inside the insu-\nlating region, not only all the propagating modes in graphene\nbut also the adjacent slowly decaying evanescent modes\ncouple to evanescent modes in the leads and hence do not\ncontribute to the transport. The remaining graphitic evanes-\ncent modes, which do couple to the propagating modes in the\nleads, all have a finite decay constant, Im k\nx\n\u0001G\u0002\b\u0010, and their\ntotal contribution to the conductance is suppressed exponen-\ntially with exp\u0001\u2212\u0010L\u0002. The sharpness of the thresholds hence\nincreases exponentially with the system size.\nThe decay constant \u0010 approaches zero as one approaches\nthe conductance thresholds. Let us assume that this is in-\nduced by changing the on-site potential V\u0001r\u0002\u2192V\u0001r\u0002,thresh at\nfixed V\u0001G\u0002, where depending on the geometry V\u0001r\u0002,thresh is de-\ntermined by Eqs. \u000112\u0002 and \u000113\u0002, or \u000114a\u0002 and \u000114b\u0002. For a\nvanishing charge-carrier density in graphene, V\u0001G\u0002=0, the lin-\near dispersion relation close to the Dirac point then entails\nthat \u0010\u0011 \nV\u0001r\u0002\u2212V\u0001r\u0002,thresh\n increases linearly with the distance to\nthe threshold, while for a finite V\u0001G\u0002, it increases faster, as\nJOHN P.

Hence, the conductance thresholds are\nsharper at a finite charge density.\nIt is insightful to contrast the exponential suppression of\nthe conductance carried by evanescent modes in the insulat-\ning region with their contribution inside the conductive re-\ngion. In this case, the most slowly decaying modes do couple\nto propagating modes in the leads. For a vanishing charge-\ncarrier density in graphene, V\u0001G\u0002=0, the conductance carried\nby the evanescent modes adds up to a contribution \u0011W \/L,\nwhich is constant and finite at a fixed aspect ratio even when\nthe system is very large.13,39 For finite V\u0001G\u0002, on the other\nhand, their contribution is proportional to W \/L4 for L\n\fa\u0001G\u0002\u0003\u0001G\u0002 \/ \nV\u0001G\u0002\n and hence decays algebraically for increas-\ning system size.40 Both expressions require that the most\nslowly decaying evanescent modes in the graphitic part\ncouple to the propagating modes in the leads, which is not\nthe case in the insulating regime.\nV. MODE MIXING\nThe derivation of conductance thresholds from the condi-\ntion of mismatching propagating modes in Sec. IV relied on\nthe conservation of transverse momentum. In this section, we\nexplore how violations of this assumption modify the thresh-\nold conditions.\nA. Mode mixing by disorder\nIn order to explore the effects of mode mixing by disor-\nder, we implement three different scattering mechanisms:\nshort-ranged bulk disorder and surface roughness in the gra-\nphitic region, as well as imperfections at the NG interfaces\n\u0001long-ranged bulk disorder does not provide efficient mode\nmixing\u0002. Bulk disorder is modeled via a random on-site po-\ntential Vi=V\u0001G\u0002+ui, where the ui are independently and iden-\ntically distributed \u0001iid\u0002 random numbers drawn with uniform\nprobability from an interval \u0003\u2212u \/2 ,u \/2\u0004. For a rough edge,\nwe randomly eliminate a fraction f of the graphene sites\nwithin a distance of 2a\u0001G\u0002 from the boundaries of the system.\nAn imperfect interface is modeled via random hopping ele-\nments \u0003ij =\u0003\u0001rG\u0002+\nij for the links crossing the interface,\nwhere the \nij are iid random numbers drawn with uniform\nprobability from an interval \u0003\u2212\n \/2 ,\n \/2\u0004.\nFigure 5 presents the results for a NGN junction with\nzigzag interface and lattice-matched leads \u0003the geometry of\nFig. 1\u0001a\u0002; the results for the other geometries are similar\u0004.\nPanel \u0001a\u0002 shows the conductance for bulk disorder of strength\nu=0.2\u0003\u0001G\u0002. Panel \u0001b\u0002 shows the conductance for surface\nroughness with f =0.3, the value for which we found the\nstrongest effect on the conductance. In both cases, the maxi-\nmal conductance is reduced to about 2 \/3 of the value found\nin the clean case. This is comparable to what is found in\nother transport studies at similar levels of disorder.49\u201353 In\ncontrast, the threshold contours delimiting the region of low\nconductance are only weakly affected by the disorder.\nFigure 5\u0001c\u0002 shows the conductance for an imperfect inter-\nface \n=0.1\u0003\u0001rG\u0002. This moderate level of imperfection has\nonly a minimal effect on the regions of high and low con-\nductance. A noticeable change of these regions is only in-\nduced for a rough interface, shown in Fig. 5\u0001d\u0002, where the\nfluctuations \n=\u0003\u0001rG\u0002 are set equal to the average interface\nhopping element. At this level of imperfection, the regions of\nlow conductance cover a smaller part in the V\u0001G\u0002-V\u0001r\u0002 plane.\nThis has to be attributed to the diffractive effects of a rough\ninterface. It is interesting to observe that the conductance\nthresholds are most robust around V\u0001G\u0002=0; especially, the\nconductance threshold in the region V\u0001r\u0002\u00070 is almost un-\nchanged even though the interface is very rough.\nB.

This results in a finite amount of mixing even for a\nclean interface, which is automatically accounted for in the\nnumerical results of Sec. II.

The on-site potentials are set to the\nvalues V\u0001G\u0002=\u0003\u0001G\u0002 and V\u0001r\u0002=0, where all modes are propagat-\ning, so that the mode mixing can be seen in transmission.\nThe figure shows that the transmission matrix is sparse. Each\nmode mixes with a small number of modes with a similar\ntransverse momentum. The additional branches originate\nfrom the different periodicity of the Brillouin zones in the\nleads and the graphitic part, already mentioned in Sec. IV. At\neach interface, the transverse momentum is only conserved\nmodulo reciprocal-lattice vectors. The periodicity of the Bril-\nlouin zone of the leads and the graphitic region in the ky\ndirection differs by a factor of 3 \/2. For the conditions of Fig.\n6, this mediates the coupling into two additional branches of\ntransverse momenta in the leads.\nVI. CONCLUSIONS\nIn this work, we systematically investigated the gate-\nvoltage dependence of the conductance of four variants of\nNGN junctions, consisting of a graphene strip, which is\ncoupled in different ways to normal leads of identical width\n\u0001Fig. 1\u0002. Starting from exact numerical computations, we\nidentified conditions of insulating behavior in clean junc-\ntions, which can be encountered even when the charge-\ncarrier density in the central graphitic region and in the\nnormal-conducting leads is finite. Conceptually, this effect\ncan be seen as the counterpart of the celebrated minimal\nfinite conductivity of graphene close to the charge-neutrality\npoint where the charge-carrier density nominally van-\nishes.5,7,9\u201318\nWe identified a simple mechanism for the conductance\nthresholds at finite charge-carrier density, namely, the decou-\npling of the propagating modes in the different parts of the\nsystem due to the mismatch of their transverse momenta.\nSince these momenta are determined by the dispersion rela-\ntion, the conductance thresholds could, in principle, be used\nto obtain information about the band structure of graphene if\nthe dispersion relation in the leads is known. Our numerical\ncomputations show that such an analysis would be robust\nagainst the effects of bulk and surface disorders in the gra-\nphitic region and would also tolerate a moderate amount of\nimperfection of the interfaces.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe gratefully acknowledge helpful discussions with\nVladimir Fal\u2019ko and Edward McCann, as well as useful cor-\nrespondence with Andre Geim and Philip Kim.

The details of the transverse-\nmomentum quantization of graphene ribbons depend on the\nchemistry of the edges.46\u201348 In this paper, we are mostly\nconcerned with wide graphitic regions, where the transverse\nmomentum becomes quasicontinuous. When we, in the fol-\nlowing, give expressions for W in the tight-binding model\nused in the numerical simulations, it should be noted that the\ndimension W refers to the width of the interface, which is\nidentical to the width of the square-lattice leads but differs\nfrom the width of the graphitic region \u0001which is wider by\n\b3a\u0001G\u0002 for zigzag interfaces and by a\u0001G\u0002 for armchair inter-\nfaces\u0002.\nOn the square lattice, W=1+W \/a\u0001r\u0002 is the number of sites\nin the cross section of the wire, and the set of quantized\ntransverse wave numbers is given by\nky =\nn\u000e\nW + 2a\u0001r\u0002 . \u0001A1\u0002\nOn the hexagonal lattice with zigzag interfaces \u0001and hence\narmchair boundaries\u0002, W=1+W \/\b3a\u0001G\u0002, and the set of quan-\ntized transverse wave numbers is given by\nky =\nn\u000e\nW + 2\b3a\u0001G\u0002 . \u0001A2\u0002\nBoth sets of quantized transverse wave numbers become\nidentical when the lattices are matched commensurably, as\nshown in Fig. 1\u0001a\u0002, where a\u0001r\u0002=\b3a\u0001G\u0002.\nMore complicated is the case of the hexagonal lattice with\narmchair interface \u0001which has zigzag edges\u0002, shown in Fig.\n1\u0001b\u0002.

A simpler variant of\nsuch an interface, well suited for analytical calculations, is\nthe interface of two commensurably matched square-lattice\nleads with different lattice constants, shown in Fig. 7. The\nlattice constants in the left and right leads are related by an\ninteger-valued reduction constant q so that a\u0001R\u0002=a\u0001L\u0002 \/q; the\ncontinuum limit of the right lead is approached for q\u2192\r.\nThis simple arrangement is representative for couplings of\nreal space leads to other tight-binding lattices, since only the\nsites adjacent to the interface enter the subsequent consider-\nations.\nThe hopping constants in the left and right leads are de-\nnoted by \u0003\u0001L\u0002 and \u0003\u0001R\u0002, respectively. In our numerical com-\nputations, we further made the assumption that these con-\nstants are related by the requirement of an identical effective\nmass m=\u00052 \/ \u00032\u0003\u0001R\u0002\u0001a\u0001R\u0002\u00022\u0004=\u00052 \/ \u00032\u0003\u0001L\u0002\u0001a\u0001L\u0002\u00022\u0004. The hopping\nconstants in the two leads are then related by \u0003\u0001R\u0002=q2\u0003\u0001L\u0002.\nOur goal is to determine the interlead hopping constant,\n\u0003\u0001LR\u0002, so that the lead is transparent for energies in the para-\nbolic region of the dispersion relation at the bottom of the\nbands of both leads.\nWe choose a coordinate system where the right lead starts\nat x=0, and the origin accommodates one of the lattice sites\nthat is linked to the left lead. Now, consider a particle arriv-\ning from the left lead at a fixed energy E and transverse wave\nnumber ky, which are both conserved under reflection from\nthe interface. The wave function\n\u0004\u0001L\u0002\u0001x,y\u0002 = Aeikx\n\u0001L\u0002\nx+ikyy + Be\u2212ikx\n\u0001L\u0002\nx+ikyy \u0001B1\u0002\nthen describes the superposition of the incoming and re-\nflected particle, where the longitudinal wave number k\nx\n\u0001L\u0002 is\nfixed by the dispersion relation \u00014\u0002.\nUpon crossing the interface, the transverse momentum is\nconserved modulo reciprocal-lattice vectors. Since the Bril-\nlouin zone in the right lead is larger by a factor q, one\ncouples into q inequivalent modes with wave number ky,p\n=ky +2\u000ep \/a\u0001L\u0002, p=0,1 , . . . ,q\u22121. For energies close to the\nbottom of the bands in both leads, only the mode with p=0 is\npropagating while the others are evanescent. We denote the\nlongitudinal wave number of the propagating mode by k\nx\n\u0001R\u0002\n,\nand the decay constant of the evanescent modes by \u0010p, p\n=1,2 , . . . ,q\u22121. The wave function in the right lead is hence\ngiven by\n\u0004\u0001R\u0002\u0001x,y\u0002 = Ceikyy\u0010eikx\u0001R\u0002x + \u0005\np=1\nq\u22121\ncpe\n\u2212\u0010px+2\u000eipy\/a\n\u0001L\u0002\u0011 . \u0001B2\u0002\nThe relative amplitudes cp of the evanescent modes are fixed\nby the boundary condition on those sites at x=0 which have\nno link to the left lead. Since the wave function \u0001B2\u0002 would\nfulfill the Schr\u00f6dinger equation when the right lead would be\ncontinued beyond the interface, this boundary condition can\nbe formally expressed as \u0004\u0001R\u0002\u0001\u2212a\u0001R\u0002 ,y\u0002=0, where y=a\u0001R\u0002p\u0001,\nwith p\u0001=1,2 , . . . ,q\u22121, is the transverse coordinate of in-\nequivalent disconnected sites. These boundary conditions\nare fulfilled when the amplitudes take the value cp\n=e\u2212\u0010pa\n\u0001R\u0002\n\u2212ik\nx\n\u0001R\u0002\na\n\u0001R\u0002\n.\nThe remaining amplitudes A, B, and C are now obtained\nfrom the boundary conditions of the sites on both leads\nwhich are linked to the other lead. Using again the fact that\nthe wave functions \u0001B1\u0002 and \u0001B2\u0002 both fulfill the Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation when the leads would be extended across the inter-\nface, these conditions can be written as\n\u0003\u0001RL\u0002\u0004\u0001R\u0002\u00010,0\u0002 = \u0003\u0001L\u0002\u0004\u0001L\u0002\u00010,0\u0002 , \u0001B3\u0002\n\u0003\u0001R\u0002\u0004\u0001R\u0002\u0001\u2212 a\u0001R\u0002,0\u0002 = \u0003\u0001RL\u0002\u0004\u0001L\u0002\u0001\u2212 a\u0001L\u0002,0\u0002 . \u0001B4\u0002\nThe reflection amplitude r=B \/A then follows as\nr = \u2212\nq\u02dc\u0003\u0001RL\u0002\n2\ne\u2212ikx\n\u0001L\u0002\na\u0001L\u0002\n\u2212 q\u0003\u0001L\u0002\u0003\u0001R\u0002e\u2212ikx\n\u0001R\u0002\na\u0001R\u0002\nq\u02dc\u0003\u0001RL\u0002\n2\neikx\n\u0001L\u0002\na\u0001L\u0002\n\u2212 q\u0003\u0001L\u0002\u0003\u0001R\u0002e\u2212ikx\n\u0001R\u0002\na\u0001R\u0002\n, \u0001B5\u0002\nwhere\nq\u02dc = 1 + \u0005\np=1\nq\u22121\ncp. \u0001B6\u0002\nAt the bottom of the band, we can further assume\nky ,kx\n\u0001R,L\u0002\u000e0, and the decay constants approach the value\na\u0001R\u0002\u0010p=arcosh\u00032\u2212cos\u00012\u000ep \/q\u0002\u0004.
