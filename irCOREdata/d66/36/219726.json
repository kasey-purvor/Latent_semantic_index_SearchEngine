We conclude that there is a need for policy and practice on young\ncaregiving, in all countries and contexts, to consider the role of social recognition and local\nconstructions of childhood in shaping the resilience of caregiving children.\nIntroduction\nChildren around the world are engaging in above-average levels of care and\nsupport for their sick or disabled parents and guardians (Aldridge and Becker,\n1999; Becker, 2007; Robson et al., 2006), siblings (Dahlblom et al., 2009) and\nageing grandparents (Skovdal, 2010a). There is no doubt that caring for an\nailing, ageing or disabled guardian can be a highly stressful situation for a child.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\n614 morten skovdal and eleni andreouli\nFurthermore, a child caring for an adult arguably falls outside contemporary and\nAnglophone understandings of what childhood should be about. It may therefore\nbe no surprise that \u2018being a young carer is portrayed in almost wholly negative\nterms in the [Anglophone] literature\u2019 (Olsen, 1996: 44). Studies of children caring\nfor parents with diseases as diverse as diabetes, HIV\/AIDS, cancer and mental\ndisorders, can testify to this trend (Aldridge and Becker, 1999; Bauman et al.,\n2009; Cooklin, 2006; Gates and Lackey, 1998; Gray et al., 2008; Jacobson\nand Wood, 2004). Research has reported that caregiving children often live\nin poverty and social exclusion (Dearden and Becker, 2000), have emotional\ndifficulties (Dearden and Becker, 1995, 1998, 2004) and impaired mental health\n(Bauman and Germann, 2005; Cree, 2003; Shifren, 2009). They experience\nill health and restricted opportunities for developing friendships and social\nnetworking, including taking part in leisure activities, and have been described\nas having limited visions of the future (Aldridge and Becker, 1993; Dearden and\nBecker, 2000) and difficulties with education (Dearden and Becker, 1998, 2004).\nNevertheless, a few studies in the UK (Aldridge, 2008; Becker, 2000), North\nAmerica (Beach, 1994; Blackford, 1999; Gates and Lackey, 1998) and Australia\n(Pakenham et al., 2007) have also observed some positive effects of caregiving,\nincluding maturity and the development of a sense of responsibility and self-\nworth. Whilst a focus on the negative impact of young caregiving has taken\nprecedence, it is increasingly acknowledged that emphasising the detrimental\noutcomes for caregiving children potentially contributes to the victimisation of\nthis group of children (cf. Aldridge, 2008; Becker, 2007; Evans and Becker, 2009;\nJoseph et al., 2009). However, we know little about the implications of such\nrepresentations of caregiving children for policy and practice. We apply theories\nof recognition and identity to argue that local representations of caregiving\nchildren have an impact on how caregiving children cope with often difficult\ncircumstances. It is against this background, and in our interest to highlight the\nimportance of identity and recognition in policy and practice, that we draw on\nresearch from Western Kenya to explore the agency and resilience of caregiving\nchildren.\nCaregiving children in sub-Saharan Africa\nAfrican children\u2019s care, work and contribution to their household are not\nnew. There are numerous anthropological studies in Africa that highlight the\ncompetence and active role children play in sustaining their household and how\nthis is an important part of their socialisation (Katz, 1996; Kenyatta, 1979; Porter,\n1996; Raum, 1940) and livelihood in contexts of poverty and disease (Abebe and\nAase, 2007; Abebe and Kj\u00f8rholt, 2009; Abebe and Skovdal, 2010).\nThe literature available on caregiving children in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)\nremains limited but is steadily expanding. Research on caregiving children in SSA\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nunderstanding and promoting the resilience of caregiving children 615\nwas spearheaded by Robson and colleagues, who have usefully mapped out the\ncircumstances of caregiving children, including the problems they are facing, such\nas disruption of schooling, loss of friends and isolation, the difficulties of looking\nafter an ailing person and the wider household and the trauma as a result of\ncaring and bereavement (cf. Robson, 2000, 2001, 2004; Robson and Ansell, 2000;\nRobson et al., 2006). In addition to identifying the problems faced by caregiving\nchildren, they have also outlined the potential benefits of young caregiving,\nincluding learning new skills, developing close and loving relationships with\nthe person they care for and growing up as a mature and responsible person\n(Robson et al., 2006). Careful about viewing children as non-competent as\ncommon Anglophone understandings of childhood represent them, but seeing\nthem as active and competent as their social environments allow (Hutchby\nand Moran-Ellis, 1998), Robson and Ansell (2000: 191) in their earlier work\nquestioned the appropriateness of using the term \u2018young carers\u2019 in Zimbabwe,\narguing that such a term \u2018is perhaps to pathologise the work in which they\nengage\u2019.\nHowever, since the foundation was laid by Robson and colleagues, a\nnumber of studies have focused on the psychosocial distress experienced by\ncaregiving children (cf. Bauman et al., 2006, 2009; BBC News, 2009; Cluver\net al., 2009; Donald and Clacherty, 2005; Martin, 2006; Shifren, 2009). Whilst\nthere is no doubt that a minority of caregiving children suffer from mental\nill health, it can be argued that the focus on children\u2019s poor mental health,\nrather than representing children\u2019s experience, reflects common Anglophone\nconstructions of childhood as a period of innocence and psychological fragility\nin the absence of adult protection (Skovdal, 2010b; Summerfield, 2000, 2004).\nOther scholars have moved beyond the vulnerability of caregiving children and\nfocused on the protective factors and agentic capabilities of children within their\nlocal context. This field of research explores how these children, in contexts\nof poverty and disease, interact with their social context in order to cope\nwith very difficult circumstances and build resilience (Evans, 2005; Evans and\nBecker, 2009; Skovdal, 2010b, in press; Skovdal and Ogutu, 2009; Skovdal et al.,\n2009).\nWhile it is unhelpful to see children as either victims or social agents, as this\nbinary distinction shadows the plurality of experiences and childhoods (Abebe\nand Kj\u00f8rholt, 2009; Kesby et al., 2006), this distinction helps locate this study\nwithin the literature. Becker (2007), in his commentary about global perspectives\non young caregiving, argues that:\nif the focus of research turns away from the \u2018vulnerability\u2019 of young carers to one concerned\nwith \u2018resilience\u2019, then researchers may be better equipped analytically to explain differences in\nexperiences and outcomes between young carers within and across countries (p. 40, emphasis\nin the original).\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\n616 morten skovdal and eleni andreouli\nIt is this direction that this paper seeks to facilitate by exploring the pathways\nthrough which caregiving children in Kenya cope with difficult circumstances.\nTo make our findings relevant to the international literature on caregiving\nchildren, we seek to identify the underlying processes that can facilitate caregiving\nchildren\u2019s resilience. In this effort, we are drawing on a theoretical framework that\nhighlights the association between local understandings of childhood, identity\nand recognition to resilience.\nIdentity and recognition\nIn an effort to move away from common understandings of caregiving children,\nwhich reflect what Evans and Becker (2009) call the \u2018deficit model\u2019 of childhood,\nto a focus on the agency of caregiving children, we adopt a constructionist\nviewpoint on resilience. The starting point for our framework is therefore that\nlocal understandings of childhood can facilitate or undermine the resilience of\ncaregiving children through processes of recognition or misrecognition.\nResilience is not an individual attribute, but it is located at the social\/\nindividual interface. Ungar (2008: 225), for example, notes that:\nin the context of exposure to significant adversity, whether psychological, environmental, or\nboth, resilience is both the capacity of individuals to navigate their way to health-sustaining\nresources, including opportunities to experience feelings of well-being, and a condition of the\nindividual\u2019s family, community and culture to provide these health resources and experiences\nin culturally meaningful ways.\nDrawing on this understanding of resilience, Skovdal et al. (2009) have high-\nlighted that caregiving children\u2019s ability to cope depends on children\u2019s ability to\nparticipate in community life and actively navigate and negotiate social support \u2013\na process mediated by local understandings of childhood which recognise\nchildren as social actors and shape their identity.\nIdentity can be defined as a socio-psychological process of positioning oneself\nin relation to others. As such, identity is as much about identification as about\nrecognition (Duveen, 2001). Recognition refers to patterns of representation that\ncirculate in a society and create the symbolic environment for the development\nof identities. Social representations can be described as systems of socially\nconstructed, commonsense knowledge, including values, ideas and practices,\nwhich enable people to orientate themselves in their social world (Moscovici,\n1973). Drawing on the theory of social representations, Duveen (1993:172) has\ndefined identity as:\na psychological process through which meanings are organised and which enables the person\nto position themselves as a social actor. Social identity in this sense is a way of organising\nexperience which contributes towards the definition of self, but does so by locating the self\nwithin the collective world.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nunderstanding and promoting the resilience of caregiving children 617\nIdentity is, thus, intertwined with one\u2019s place in a community. This suggests that\n\u2018it is not enough simply to assert an identity; that assertion must also be validated,\nor not, by those with whom we have dealings\u2019 (Jenkins, 1996: 42).\nThe impact of recognition on the development of self has been theorised by G.\nH. Mead. Mead (1934) conceptualises the self as arising through the relationship\nbetween the I, the here and now self in action, and the Me, the self as an object of\nknowledge. Only by being able to see oneself through the eyes of the other(s), as\nan object, can one become self-conscious. Therefore, the way we are seen or recog-\nnised by others is integral to our sense of self. The \u2018other\u2019 can take many forms: it\ncan be a reference group, an institution, or a knowledge system (Markova\u00b4, 2006).\nConcerning caregiving children, the \u2018other\u2019 can be the prevalent representations\nof childhood. In Mead\u2019s terms, such representations and norms form part of the\n\u2018generalised other\u2019. Mead argues that for a person to be socialised as a member of\na community, he or she has to appropriate the perspective of the generalised other\n(Mead, 1934). Therefore, in order to construct an identity, caregiving children\nhave to situate themselves in relation to the norms and representations that\ndefine childhood (see Duveen, 2001; Duveen and Lloyd, 1986; Moloney and\nWalker, 2007). The representation of caregiving children as children who have\nlost their childhood and the lack of recognition of their efforts can therefore be\ndetrimental to their identity. Taylor (1992: 25) refers to this as \u2018misrecognition\u2019:\nOur identity is partly shaped by recognition or its absence, often by the misrecognition of\nothers, and so a person or a group of people can suffer real damage, real distortion, if the people\nor the society around them mirror back to them a confining or demeaning or contemptible\npicture of themselves.\nAgainst that, Honneth (1995) has argued that recognition of a person\u2019s abilities and\nachievements enhances that person\u2019s social esteem in that he or she is recognised\nas a contributor towards achieving community goals. Thus, recognition can play a\nlegitimating and empowering role. Being recognised means being acknowledged\nas a competent and legitimate social actor (Noble, 2009).\nHowever, as our review of the literature highlights children in the West\nare too often seen as lacking agency. This is part of the common Anglophone\nrepresentations of childhood that position children as adults in the making.\nThis perspective on childhood is also evident in traditional child development\ntheories (cf. Piaget, 1953). As a result, caregiving children are seen predominantly\nas victims. Relating Western notions of childhood to the literature on caregiving\nchildren, Evans and Becker (2009: 244) point out:\nchildren\u2019s role in caring for parents\/relatives with HIV conflicts with hegemonic Western notions\nof childhood as a protected phase when children should be free to play with their friends and\ngo to school without having to think about responsibilities associated with \u2018adulthood\u2019.\nOn the other hand, social representations and contexts that recognise children as\ncompetent social actors have the potential of enhancing the agency of caregiving\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\n618 morten skovdal and eleni andreouli\nchildren (Robson et al., 2007). As Hutchby and Moran-Ellis argue (1998: 6):\n\u2018Childhood is not a natural phenomenon or fixed stage of life, but a historically\nand culturally variable social construction.\u2019 Therefore, different contexts produce\ndifferent understandings about the role of children in the community. In order\nto be able to support caregiving children, we need to recognise them as both\ncompetent social actors and potentially vulnerable beings in need of protection.\nIn this effort, it is necessary to deconstruct universalistic representations of\nchildhood and critically explore the benefits of \u2018other childhoods\u2019 (Kesby\net al., 2006).\nMethodology\nTo gain a more in-depth understanding of how identity and recognition are played\nout and have the potential to facilitate the resilience of caregiving children, this\ncase study brings together the views of 48 caregiving children and ten adults from\nthe Bondo district of Western Kenya. The study was granted ethical clearance\nby the Research Ethics Committees of the London School of Economics and the\nDepartment of Gender and Social Services in Kenya. We have used pseudonyms\nto protect the identity of participants.\nStudy location and participants\nThe data for this study were collected between November 2006 and\nSeptember 2007 from two rural communities in Bondo district. Bondo district\nborders Lake Victoria and is characterised by its many fish-landing beaches and\nhigh HIV prevalence rates (Nyambedha and Aagaard-Hansen, 2007). Bondo is\none of the poorest districts in Kenya, with 47.2 per cent of its people living in\nabsolute poverty (GOK, 2002) and still has one of the highest HIV prevalence\nrates (15.3 per cent) in the country, which, despite a decrease, remains twice the\nKenyan national average of 7.4 per cent (NASCOP\/MOH, 2008).\nA total of 48 children and ten adults were purposively sampled for this study.\nThe children were sampled through community gatekeepers who were instructed\nto identify roughly an equal number of boys and girls between 11\u201317 years old who\nprovided above-average levels of care and support to adults. The type of care the\nchildren engaged in involved nursing of parents (feeding, bathing, administering\nmedicines), domestic duties (cleaning, washing and cooking), income generation\n(farming, charcoal burning, sewing) and emotional support (listening, providing\nadvice and praying). The socio-demographic characteristics of the children, as\nwell as whom they care for, are presented in Table 1.\nData sources\nPhotography has been identified as a particularly useful method in doing\nresearch with children whose views and perceptions have previously been\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nunderstanding and promoting the resilience of caregiving children 619\nTABLE 1.

Reflecting the objectives of\nthis paper, photography gave us a medium to involve children in the research\nprocess, bringing forward their voices rather than the representations that may\nbe held by the researchers in the way children are conceptualised and understood\n(McDonald, 2009). Following a series of workshops on how to take photos\nand the ethical implications of taking a photograph, we distributed disposable\ncameras to all 48 children and encouraged them to address four questions when\ntaking photos: (1) \u2018What is your life like?\u2019, (2) \u2018What is good about your life?\u2019,\n(3) \u2018What makes you strong?\u2019 and (4) \u2018What needs to change?\u2019. From the 240\nphotos generated, the children were asked to pick their six favourite photos and\nwrite reflections for each photo prompted by three questions: (1) \u2018I want to\nshare this photo because. . .\u2019, (2) \u2018What\u2019s the real story this photo tells?\u2019, and\n(3) \u2018How does this story relate to your life and\/or the lives of people in your\nneighbourhood?\u2019. The children were also provided with colour pens and paper\nto draw-and-write reflections they were unable to capture on camera, either for\npractical or ethical reasons. A total of 184 photos and 56 drawings were generated\nfrom this exercise. In different workshops, the children were encouraged to write\nessays on their caring experiences (n = 27) and complete historical time lines\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\n620 morten skovdal and eleni andreouli\n(n = 48) and daily diagrams (n = 48). An additional 24 individual interviews\nand two group conversations were conducted to expand on some of the issues\nand themes brought up in their written reflections. All the 24 children that were\ninterviewed had diverse experiences that would enrich this qualitative study. To\ngain a better insight of the social setting in relation to being a child and caregiving,\nten individual interviews with adults (caregivers, community representatives,\nsocial development officers) were conducted. All interviews were recorded.\nData preparation and analysis\nAll the data were verbatim transcribed, translated and typed before being\nimported to AtlasTi for coding and thematic network analysis (cf. Attride-\nStirling, 2001; Braun and Clarke, 2006). Thematic analysis systematises the data\ninto a hierarchical order with basic and descriptive themes at the lowest order.\nThese basic themes are summarised into more abstract principles (organising\nthemes) that encapsulate a principle issue evident in the data set (global theme)\n(Attride-Stirling, 2001). The first author did a primary analysis which generated\na total of 122 basic themes which made up 20 organising themes and five global\nthemes (dynamics and characteristics of life-worlds; determinants of caring\nexperiences; characteristics and perceptions of \u2018young carers\u2019 in Western Kenya;\nsocial coping strategies; psychological coping strategies). This paper reports on\na secondary analysis of this data set, exploring identity and recognition and\nhow this can potentially lead to resilience. This secondary analysis required us\nto look at networks and relationships between the organising and basic themes\nidentified in the primary analysis. Key themes relevant to this particular study\nwere identified and grouped together to theorise the socio-cultural context and\nsymbolic resources that facilitated resilience. Our analysis revealed an interwoven\nrelationship between the social recognition of caregiving children\u2019s agency\n(rooted in local constructions of childhood) and the construction of positive\nsocial identities which enhances their resilience.\nFindings\nThe HIV and AIDS epidemic has affected many families in SSA. However, to fully\nunderstand the agency and coping strategies of children and households affected\nby AIDS, an appreciation of the cultural context is necessary. Our findings are\nintrinsically linked to the cultural systems of the Luo ethnic group, the second\nlargest ethnic group of people in Kenya, and must be understood against this\nunique socio-cultural and religious context. Whilst Luo culture is traditionally\ncharacterised by a clear gender and age hierarchy, governing social relations\nand dictating certain practices (Potash, 1978; Southall, 1952), the continuity\nand transformation of these practices are influenced by religion, modernity,\ndisease and poverty. Whilst modernity and the introduction of free and accessible\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nunderstanding and promoting the resilience of caregiving children 621\nprimary education may challenge certain cultural systems, disease and poverty,\nreflecting a continued lack of structural support, have reinforced the traditional\nvalue of children in this context as active contributors to their household.\nRepresentations of childhood and social recognition of agency\nIn contexts of disease and poverty, many children in Bondo are expected\nto contribute to their household livelihoods, both through income-generating\nactivities and by helping out with domestic responsibilities. Children\u2019s active\ncontribution is framed by their position as competent members of their\nhousehold. The children are assigned responsibilities that reflect the expectations\nof this poor rural community setting, expectations that are undoubtedly different\nfrom children living in a middle-class home in an urban centre.\nA ten-year-old is a grown up. That one can do everything. She can wash t-shirts, she can wash\nyour skirt, she can wash dirty clothes, that is a grown up . . . She can also work, fetch water,\ncook, mop the house or plaster it using cow dung. (Female adult 2 in an interview)\nThe representation of children as active participants in the household economy is\na reflection of the dynamic interplay between their material needs and normative\nexpectations. Because of the endemic poverty that characterises the area, many\nhouseholds remain dependent on children\u2019s contribution to sustain household\nlivelihoods.\nIn our culture, a child must go to the garden, he must clear the compound and the land for\ncultivation. He has to cultivate because that is how we get food. In Luo culture, if you don\u2019t\nwork hard, you will not get anything to eat. A lazy person remains poor. (Male adult 5 in an\ninterview)\nSuch socio-cultural understandings of childhood, coupled with the lack of\nsocial welfare, the AIDS epidemic and poverty have all contributed to the\nadded responsibilities of children providing care and support to ailing or ageing\nhousehold members. The next quotation illustrates the agency of some caregiving\nchildren, giving detail to some of the added duties they may take on, the\npsychosocial benefits of caring, as well as pride in contributing to the family\nand community.\nWhen we help the sick we use our talent. Sometimes I help my mother by fetching water,\nfirewood, wash the clothes and the utensils. I always find ways of helping the sick. When I help\nmy parents I feel good and they also help me in time of trouble and with school. When one of\nmy parents is sick, I help him or her by giving them food to help them recover from the disease\nthey have. Helping someone teaches us to love people and it promotes peace within the family\nand in the community. (Michael, age 15, in photovoice exercise)\nThe caregiving responsibilities of children like Michael are acknowledged by\nadults in the community. One female community member, for example, makes\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\n622 morten skovdal and eleni andreouli\na clear distinction between caregiving and non-caregiving children, highlighting\nthe positive contribution of children in caring for sick and elderly guardians.\nThe difference between a child whose parents are still alive and well and a child who is living\nand caring for the ill or the old adult is that the child living with the sick or old grandmother is\ngood because she knows that if there is no water, she is the one to fetch it. She checks if there\nis flour, or whether food is lacking. But the one living with the parents relaxes and knows that\nthe mother will do this and that. (Female adult 4 in an interview)\nAs this community member notes, caregiving children meet, and possibly exceed,\nthe expectations of their community and culture. The above quotations have\nalluded to the competence and agency of children in this rural community\nsetting in sustaining their household economy and have highlighted the active\nparticipation of some children in caring for their ageing or ailing guardians. A\nnumber of children drew clear links between their activities as caregivers and a\ncollective appreciation by the community.\nI help my grandmother by fetching water, harvesting, washing plates and even cooking.\nSometimes I even go and search for money to buy food for her. This photo is related to\nme because it shows good behaviour. It makes people in the area live in peace and harmony\nand creates love within the community. (Pascal, age 14, in photovoice exercise)\nI took this picture because the mother in this photo is a widow. She is the mother whom I\nam always taking care of. I always fetch water and collect firewood for her during my leisure\ntime. The photo is connected to me and my community because I am loved by everyone in the\ncommunity. (Catherine, age 14, in photovoice exercise)\nAs a result of the social recognition of their caring duties, many children expressed\na sense of pride and fulfilment. Fourteen-year-old Everline, for example, who\nfirst cared for her mother and subsequently her grandmother, as well as 17-\nyear-old Carren, take pride in the respect and love they have earned from their\ncommunities.\nPeople in the community love me, they are proud of me, making me earn respect from the\nadults. (Everline, age 14 in an interview)\nThere was a day my mother was feeling unwell and it was my responsibility to work hard and\nfeed my younger siblings and keeping them clean all the time. I carry on that way and feel it is\nvery good. The villagers are very proud of me (Carren, age 17 in an essay)\nHere we have shown that the social representations of childhood in Bondo\nare based on the image of children as active participants in community life.\nThese representations draw on the history and cultural heritage as well as the\nlived circumstances of this community which are characterised by disease and\npoverty. Rather than adults in the making, children are seen as agents who can\nplay a vital role in the community. These local understandings of childhood,\nposition children in relation to the wider community and provide a guide for\nsocial behaviour. In this sense, they mediate intra-community relations. By\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nunderstanding and promoting the resilience of caregiving children 623\nemphasising the active role of children in the community, representations of\nchildhood encourage caregiving activities as a valuable community resource.\nCaregiving children\u2019s position within this network of meanings is characterised\nby a moral duty to look after their ailing family members. Through caring for\nailing guardians, children fulfil their moral duty towards the community and, for\nthat reason, they are being respected and recognised. This recognition forms part\nof their sense of self and enhances their self-esteem and sense of achievement vis-\na`-vis the community. These feelings and emotions can help the children build\nresilience and positive caregiving identities. Therefore, recognition becomes a\nsource of social support that children can draw on.\nIdentity and resilience\nAs argued in our theoretical framework, identity is both a position towards\nothers and a perspective towards the world. By taking on an identity position,\nindividuals can organise their experiences and make sense of the world around\nthem. Caregiving identities, by defining children\u2019s active role in community life,\nhelp the children make sense of their difficult circumstances. In addition, by\nbeing recognised by the community, caregiving children are able to construct\npositive identities. Instead of seeing themselves as victims, they attribute positive\nmeanings to their caregiving role and responsibilities and see themselves as\ncontributors to community life. This sense of agency allows children to draw on\nsocial and symbolic resources in order to cope with very difficult circumstances.\nIn this section, we seek to show that resilience and, consequently, children\u2019s\npsychological well-being are built upon participation and agency and are\nintrinsically linked to the construction of positive caregiving identities.\nA large number of children acknowledged the benefits of caregiving. Fifteen-\nyear-old Janet cared primarily for her bedridden father and received limited\nsupport from her also sick mother. She subsequently moved in with her\ngrandmother with whom she is now staying. Her quotation shows how some\nchildren, by constructing a caregiver identity, make sense of their caregiving\nduties. Janet gains confidence from this identity and sees caregiving as a positive\nexperience. She happily takes on the role of caring for others outside of her\nhousehold and adopts this identity to positively define herself in relation to the\noverall community.\nThe way I have been taking care of the sick in the past has helped me to become courageous in\nassisting others. I find it quite easy, so when anybody is sick I can pay them a visit and assist\nthem accordingly. My experience has made me brave and courageous to handle various issues.\n(Janet, age 15, in an interview)\nWhat also transpires from Janet\u2019s account is the construction of a positive\ncaregiver identity that facilitates character building and resilience. This was also\nnoted by 14-year-old Francis who compares himself with non-caring children.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\n624 morten skovdal and eleni andreouli\nThe caregiver identity that Francis develops positions him in relation to the social\nrepresentations of childhood in this local community. Key characteristics of this\nidentity are being responsible and self-reliant, which help Francis and many\nother caregiving children construct a distinctive positive identity compared to\nnon-caring children.\nCaring for the sick has made me a responsible boy. I do not loiter around doing nothing.\nCaregiving children are hard working and it makes them self-reliant and gives them the skills\nneeded for daily survival. (Francis, age 14, in an interview)\nPositive meanings and emotions can help children cope with the negative effects\nof difficult circumstances, building psychological resilience towards improved\nemotional well-being (Tugade and Fredrickson, 2004). It has also been shown\nthat the meanings caregiving children give to their experience have an impact\non how well they cope, with positive meanings and positive caregiving identities\nbeing linked to more successful coping (Skovdal and Ogutu, 2009). Positive\nidentities help the children widen their ability to negotiate social support. This is\nillustrated by 15-year-old Michael who draws on his caregiver identity to access\nsupport and improve his well-being.\nThere are different ways to help the needy. You can use your talent to help somebody. The\ngreatest challenge is to identify the talent that God has given you . . . this photo is related to\nmy life in that when I use my talent to help others and use it wisely, God also feels happy.\nSometimes I also get gifts from others when I help them. Some give me gifts like clothes and\nfood when they can afford. Helping the needy has really improved my life. (Michael, age 15, in\nphotovoice exercise)\nThese quotations illustrate that caregiving can be constructed as a positive\nexperience. As such, caregiving children are able to draw on and reinforce a\npositive caregiver identity which can facilitate resilience and well-being. However,\nin order to construct a positive identity, children must be acknowledged by\ntheir communities as social actors. Therefore, social recognition of children\u2019s\ncaregiving role by the community can be conceptualised as a source of social\nsupport that children can draw on to cope with their circumstances.\nImplications for policy and practice\nTo appropriate policy and practice for caregiving children in Kenya and beyond,\nthe aim of this paper was to highlight the importance of recognition and identity\nin understanding and promoting resilience. To do this, we focused on a local\nKenyan context where children have been observed to cope well with young\ncaregiving (Skovdal and Ogutu, 2009; Skovdal et al., 2009). An immediate\nlimitation is that our Kenyan case study is not representative of other young\ncaregiving contexts in Africa, nor does it represent an ideal context \u2013 largely\nbecause of the lack of support services available to caregiving children. So, whilst\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nunderstanding and promoting the resilience of caregiving children 625\nwe are keen to emphasise the agency of children, we are acutely aware that by\nfocusing on children\u2019s resilience we are shadowing the real grim reality that has\nleft many of the participating children in very difficult circumstances. However,\nwe believe that our Kenyan case study has provided useful pointers to some of\nthe social psychological resources that can facilitate resilience, which, alongside\nour theoretical framework, have implications for future policy and practice.\nWe have argued that children\u2019s position within the community is mediated\nby a complex web of factors that include the socio-cultural and religious context,\ndisease and poverty. In light of this, we have explored how recognition of\nagency is played out amongst caregiving children in rural Kenya as they cope\nwith difficult circumstances. We have shown that recognition of children\u2019s\nagency \u2013 in our Kenyan context \u2013 is intrinsically linked to local understandings\nof childhood which, contrary to dominant Anglophone understandings of\nchildhood, construct children as active agents in community life. We found that\nthis social recognition encouraged children\u2019s participation in community life and\nenabled them to construct positive identities that enhanced their resilience. The\ndata presented in this paper support the argument that recognition of agency\nenhances resilience.\nThese findings have important implications for policy and practice in Kenya\nand other African contexts. The study shows that caregiving children are not\nonly victims of difficult circumstances, but they can, if the social and symbolic\nresources are available to them, make sense of their difficult circumstances,\nand construct social meanings that will help them cope (Antonovsky, 1979,\n1987). There is therefore a need to develop and make available the social and\nsymbolic resources that children draw on to build positive social identities and\ncope. What these social and symbolic resources are will differ across cultural\ncontexts, emphasising the need for further research in this area in different\ncultural contexts. As social and symbolic resources (e.g. social representations)\nare dynamic and open to change, efforts should be made to reframe negative and\nvictimising representations of children in difficult circumstances and explore how\nalternative and strengths-based representations can open up promising arenas\nfor future interventions. Reflecting this recommendation, programmes targeting\ncaregiving children in African contexts, in addition to providing the children with\npractical support, need to provide the children and adults in their communities\nwith social spaces in which they can assess the circumstances surrounding\ncaregiving children. For example, caregiving children can be brought together\ninto youth clubs to engage with each other through sports and income generating\nactivities (Skovdal, in press) and adults can be sensitised through community mo-\nbilisation tools such as community conversations (UNDP, 2004), stepping stones\n(Welbourn, 1995) or participatory learning and action techniques (Rifkin, 1986).\nWhilst our findings explicitly highlight recognition of children\u2019s agency as\na social and symbolic resource, our findings also, albeit implicitly, highlight\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\n626 morten skovdal and eleni andreouli\nthe limitations of a misrecognition of caregiving children\u2019s agency. In the\nintroduction, we highlighted a concern by Olsen (1996) that the literature on\ncaregiving children in Anglophone contexts is predominantly represented in\nnegative terms, a concern others have also more recently recognised (Aldridge,\n2008; Skovdal, 2010b). For Taylor (1992) such victimisation can be a form of\nmisrecognition because it shrinks or distorts the children\u2019s social reality to a\nreality objectified by social services and care workers (in an Anglophone context),\ninternational aid agencies (African context), researchers and policy-makers.\nIn their investigation of the importance of social identities in policy, Hockey\nand James (2003: 90) have noted that children, and indeed representations of\nchildhood, are shaped by policy as a \u2018conceptual category and social identity\nthat is given material form in everyday life\u2019. It is therefore a concern when the\nmajority of research into the circumstances of caregiving children is problem-\nfocused, leading researchers and policy-makers to overwhelmingly dwell on the\nnegatives of young caregiving. We therefore suggest that policy and practice for\ncaregiving children in all countries should take this into account and shift its\nfocus. In order to support caregiving children, policy interventions ought to\nenhance children\u2019s coping abilities by recognising them as agents, rather than\nundermining the potential benefits of caregiving.\nHowever, there is a fine line between acknowledging the agency of caregiving\nchildren and detracting responsibility from the state. Welfare support is essential\nin helping caregiving children cope with difficult circumstances. But this support\nshould be designed within a framework of building resilience and encouraging\nagency and children\u2019s coping skills. The success of any programme seeking to\nsupport caregiving children in Africa and beyond are therefore dependent on\nthe attitudes of all people involved, from community members, to donors,\nservice providers, policy-makers and researchers. We conclude that incorporating\nrecognition of children\u2019s agency in policy and practice can help implement more\nsuccessful interventions.\nAcknowledgements\nWe are forever grateful to the children of the two communities that participated in this study,\nand Vincent Onyango and Cellestine Aoro for their support in data collection and dedication\nto build rapport with the children.\nReferences\nAbebe, T. and Aase, A.
