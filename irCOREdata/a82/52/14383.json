They argue that \u2018the increasing complexity of learning\nsituations will require and help people to become more design-savvy\u2019, and present\npatterns and pattern language as a means of facilitating this. What is appealing to me\nabout this approach is the way in which patterns might provide a valuable way of\ncapturing practice; however, it raises issues about how (or whether) educational\npractice can be \u2018codified\u2019 and whether a shared, common, meaningful understanding\ncan be achieved. It seems that this paper goes to the heart of one of the \u2018holy grails\u2019\nof current e-learning research, namely the search for mechanisms to provide more\nuseful support to practitioners to create more pedagogically informed learning\nactivities. This is certainly evident in many current funding initiatives, not least the\nJISC (Joint Information Systems Committee)\u2019s e-pedagogy programme.\nIn a different way Phil Levy is also looking to elicit practice. She presents a\npedagogical framework for process support in networked learning, using a case study\nanalysis of learners\u2019 experiences coupled with a critical evaluation of educational\npractice. She contents that practitioners do not fully understand the relationship\nbetween their educational designs and their outcomes\u2014a sentiment that seems to\necho some of the driving motivation for Goodyear et al.\u2019s work. The model she\npresents for \u2018capturing\u2019 practice and bridging this gap, however, is quite different to\nthat proposed by Goodyear et al. Her framework identifies four areas for integrated\nprocess support (orientation, communication, socialisation and organisation) within\ntwo design\/action phases\u2014induction and on-going support. The relationship\nbetween these she suggests is in-parallel and interconnected rather than sequential.\nAlsop and Tompsett consider the methodological issues surrounding qualitative\nanalysis, and provide a detailed critical reflection on one particular approach\u2014\nphenomenography. They argue that too often methodological positions are adopted\nin e-learning research without clear justification or awareness of particular weaknesses.\n210 Editorial\nFinally, Jones and Cooke return to the theme of qualitative analysis by describing\ntwo case studies of online group communication and collaboration, arguing that this\napproach can lead to an opening up of a \u2018window into learning\u2019 providing new insights\ninto complex problem-solving and thinking processes. Again this offers an alternative\nstrategy to that put forward by Levy as a means of understanding and improving our\nown practice. One of their conclusions is that \u2018looking through this \u201cwindow\u201d enables\nus to concentrate our assessment more closely on the process of task completion, rather\nthan focusing solely on the end product\u2019.\nFor me, a host of questions arise from reading these papers in terms of the\nmethodological and theoretical implications they raise. Also it seems to me that we\nare now seeing evidence of the ways in which, as a community of e-learning researchers,\nwe are beginning to diverge and adopt different theoretical and methodological\npositions. It will be interesting in time to see what differences arise as a result and how\nthey help us address some of the core questions and issues in our area.\nGr\u00e1inne Conole\nThe Open University, UK\n"}
