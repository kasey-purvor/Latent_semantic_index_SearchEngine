Ideas are offered up for \nthe development of marketing knowledge and ways are suggested to help close the \ntheory practice gap in the discipline, through the medium of the textbook. \n \n 1\nINTRODUCTION: THEORY, PRACTICE AND THE MARKETING \nTEXTBOOK \n \nThe gap between theory and practice in business is well documented. A number of \narticles in well renowned academic journals have pointed out that the gulf between \nthese two areas in professions is widening, see Van de Ven and Johnson (2006), \nBennis and O\u2019Toole (2005). A particular area of concern is presented by the field of \nmarketing, where it has been suggested (Gumesson 1993; 2002 Hackley 2003a), that \nmany textbooks in common use fail to adequately represent the reality of marketing \npractice. This paper seeks to explore this putative gap. It draws on some research \ncarried out into the perceptions of marketing managers as to their practical activity,   \ncomparing    findings with standard accounts of marketing in textbooks. It is apparent \nthat what writers of the latter are good at developing are universal overarching \ntheories of the discipline and setting them up as a basis for action (Brown 1995; \n2001). Furthermore, as Hackley (2003a) argues, there is an inbuilt assumption in the \nmajority of texts that marketing can be learnt in the abstract. These approaches are \nevident in many leading texts, typical of the ones used on many undergraduate \nmarketing courses; see for example Jobber (2004), Brassington and Pettitt (2005); \nDibb and Simkin et al (2005); Kotler and Wong et al (2005). The theories referred to \nlatter in the article are well rehearsed in these texts and others like them. Market \nsegmentation variables exist as a priori truths. The product life cycle indicates the \ntype of marketing response necessary at each of its stages. There is a normative \ncommunications planning model which emphasises a universal view of consumer \nbehaviour. Marketing plans should adopt the same structure everywhere, irrespective \nof context or size of firm. These `articles of faith\u2019 (Kent 1986), are informed by a \n 2\nhypothetic deductive approach rooted in a systems perspective. The assumption is that \nwe start from an abstractly generated theory and then move into the real world (Tapp \net al 2006). Marketing textbooks conform to this positivistic model of the world, \nwhere marketing action is seen as either being consistent with a theory or as an \naberrant deviation from it. In contrast, praxis suggests that marketing theory as \nespoused in textbooks is rarely found (Edwards 2005). Yet still these frameworks are \nperpetuated as being eminently useful. \n \n This paper argues that what is out there instead, is a range of disparate marketing \npractices. The latter first and foremost conform to a local logic of action and not to \nsome abstract system of marketing thought. Marketing textbooks it is suggested, need \nto be restructured, paying more attention to the interpreted nature of knowledge, \nBerger and Luckman (1966); Silverman (1970; 1994). It is not one overarching \npositivistic theory with attendant models that we should be looking for, but many \nsocially mediated theories.  Most standard marketing texts appear to assume that all \naction is activated through technical theory (Dunne1999), when in reality \norganisations are about a complex, interpreted social world. At the disposal of any \nmarketing textbook writer are a range of emic techniques, which could be potentially \nused to facilitate better understanding of the vagaries of the practitioner\u2019s world. \nThese ways of knowing are rarely mentioned in texts and are largely underutilised in \nthe study of marketing management generally. Techniques included in this approach \nembrace grounded theory, ethnography, the phenomenological interview and \nethnomethodology (Goulding 2005; Ehigie and Ehigie 2005; Hassard 1990). \n \n 3\nSimon (1994), points out that managers are valuable sources of information, where \nthey are conveyors of an understanding that is rarely exploited in research into \nmarketing. This is apparent in the majority of texts. Apart from the selection of often \nterse case studies in books, there is little engagement with the narrative form as \nexpressed in the words of actual marketing managers. Short vignettes are put side by \nside with passages on marketing theory. Rarely do we see marketing practice \narticulated from the perspective of those who implement it. As a consequence, \nwhether or not marketing principles were actually employed becomes very difficult to \ndetermine. As Hackley (2003a, p1342) points out, \u201cMarketing texts offer little \nethnographic or other contextual information\u2026\u201d  Evidence of the fact that marketing \nis largely about different local realities, rather than platitudinous generalisation, is \nprovided by the research study reported on later. Tapp et al (2006) make the important \npoint that marketing is not amenable to study by an abstract and generalised method. \nIt is a social construct almost impossible to externalise outside of dialogue and debate. \nMarketing management is hence a complex and nebulous phenomenon. Tapp et al \n(2006) call for the applied academic, (who also usually writes textbooks), to get \nnearer to this type of knowledge that is trans - disciplinary, reflecting the messy world \nof the practitioner.  The paper seeks to respond to this imperative. \n \nTHE PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH APPROACH  \n \nIn order to examine marketing practice from an interpretative perspective, with the \naim of attempting to highlight the discrepancies between the theory of textbooks and \nreality, an inquiry based on a phenomenological approach was adopted. \nPhenomenology takes into account the experiencing person and the connections between \n 4\nhuman consciousness and objects existing in the natural world. In phenomenology, \nperception is regarded as the primary source of knowledge and is a source that cannot be \ndoubted (Moustakas, 1994). The object of a conscious act or experience is inseparable \nfrom the meaning attached to it. The phenomenological approach involves an \nunderstanding of experience in order to obtain a comprehensive description that provides \nthe basis for a reflective structural analysis. This is usually obtained through the open-\nended interview, which is a first person\u2019s report of life experiences (Marshall and \nRossman 1999). These life experiences can often be articulated as narratives, further \nadding to the richness of the researcher\u2019s insights (Shankar and Goulding 2001). As \nGoulding (1999) points out, phenomenology is  a term often misused to refer to the \nqualitative paradigm generally, when in fact it more rightly refers to a distinct \nphilosophy and method.  \n \nThe phenomenological research study in this paper, involved having conversations with \nsenior marketing managers who could speak for marketing activity in their organisation. \nThomas (1993), points out that access in a qualitative study is both time consuming \nand difficult. With this in mind, considerable effort was put into obtaining and \nscrutinising a number of lists of local organisations operating in the area of the study. \nThese lists were principally obtained from the local Chamber of Commerce.  Over \neighty different marketing managers were written to, using a standard letter, asking \nfor interview access. In the end, twenty four interviews were completed with \nmarketing managers representing a wide range of small, medium and large sized \norganisations. Interviewees  came from printing, building contracting, book \npublishing, meat slicing equipment manufacture, financial services, retailing, \ncomputer  hardware and software, professional services,  public sector leisure, \n 5\ntelevision, consultancy, and a  charity. Also interviewed were marketing managers \nfrom manufacturers of beauty products, handbags, paint brushes, packaging \nequipment and small electrical motors. For the purpose of this paper, all respondents \nand their companies have been made anonymous, along with the particular area of the \ncountry in which the interviews took place. In all cases, fictitious names have been \nadopted. The intention of this research project was to get access to a differentiated \nrange of situations, in order to try and make sense of the perceptions of marketing \nmanagers\u2019 approaches to the implementation of marketing.  In this respect, it was \nthought that there was no ideal number of companies to research, because it is \nsuggested that each will have a unique approach to marketing and as Garfinkel (1984) \npoints out, there is no master reality to uncover. Sampling involving notions of \ngeneralisability were rejected, as this can be seen as incompatible with an \ninterpretivist approach which sees the data of the study as an end in itself (Hackley \n2003b). \n \nHolstein and Gubruim (1995), suggest that for qualitative interviews, an interview \nguide is constructed, which makes available to the  interviewer a set of predetermined \nquestions which can engage the respondent and establish the area of investigation. \nSuch a guide was prepared and used for all interviews. The interview guide for this \nproject was designed to be tentative and contingent and to not resemble the approach \nused in standardised survey interviewing.   In most cases, rapport was built prior to \nthe interview stage, when arrangements for the latter were being made. This involved \ntelephoning potential respondents and quite often this meant that conversations took \nplace about the nature of the research. By the time of the actual interview, most \nmanagers had been spoken to in advance. Attempts were made to understand \n 6\ninterviewee\u2019s experiences in a situation of guaranteed confidentiality. Managers \nresponded openly and candidly to questions due to these efforts at rapport building. \nThe latter process was also enhanced as a result of the interview taking place in a \ncomfortable setting, namely at the managers place of work, a point made by Thomas \n(1993). All interviews were transcribed professionally. The interviews were \nreproduced verbatim and nothing missed out. The resulting transcripts were returned \nto the interviewee for verification, a process Bloor (1978) refers to as respondent \nvalidation. The final stage of research involved the process of phenomenological \nanalysis, where the common mode of presenting findings is through the use of \nselected quotes. The latter were drawn from the interviews, enabling the process of \nmeaning condensation to occur (Kvale 1996).  \n \nFINDINGS: MARKETING AND THE POVERTY OF TRADITIONAL \nTEXTBOOK THEORY \n \nBrown (1998) has pointed out that what exists in textbooks is no trivial matter. He \nsuggests that it can be argued they represent the very essence of the marketing \ndiscipline, a point also made  by Gummesson (1993; 2002).  If false frameworks are \nbeing promulgated, then these need replacing. One such framework is represented by \nthe common definition of marketing used. In textbooks, standard definitions of \nmarketing make little or no reference to context; see the example in Brassington and \nPettittt (2005).  Marketing is defined universally, with little attention paid to the manner \nin which it might be interpreted by organisational members. This standard definition can \nbe seen as potentiality invalidating other marketing meanings and actions, which do not \nconform to the same pre-determined measures (Kent, 1986).  The issue here, confirmed \n 7\nby the research, is that practising managers have different perceptions of what marketing \nis compared to the dictates of normative theory. For most managers, marketing was not \ndefined in any abstract way outside of their own activity frame. The implications are that \nDifferent definitions of marketing can result in different enacted realities (Kent 1986; \n1998). \n \nA specific organisationally focused definition of marketing, representative of the general \nfindings is offered by Clive Terry the marketing and sales manager of Thor Engineering, \na manufacturer of meat slicing equipment.  He said that marketing is,  \n \n\u201cExploring the needs of manufacturers and gearing our design efforts to solve their \nproblems.\"  \n \nThe general findings of the research  indicate that the sense of any object is derived from \nits context, or is `indexed' to a particular situation (Heritage 1984).This is not to say that \nmanagers could not define marketing differently; they just chose not to use the latter, \npreferring to talk about marketing as a locally contingent phenomenon. In considering \ndefinitions and their impact on practice, Robson and Rowe (1997) point out that a \nphenomenological study would be of great assistance in assessing the true role of selling \nin marketing. They postulate that a significant number of marketing academics claim \nthat selling is actually extraneous to marketing activity. As Brown (2006a p221) has \npointed out, marketing is first and foremost about \u2018selling stuff\u2019 a point that sometimes \nseems to be obscured in marketing textbooks, which often attempt to make scientific \nsounding statements about market oriented companies being more profitable than ones \nwith selling orientations.  Judging by some of the comments from managers in this \n 8\nstudy, selling is seen as being a very significant aspect of marketing. Jason Hobart, \nMarketing Director of Stirling Publisher commented that, \n \n...marketing is at the end of the day selling, and you sell more by having the right \nproduct at the right price and knowing who the right people are to sell it to.\" \n \nIn general terms here, it might be tempting to suggest that these managers may not \n\u2018understand\u2019 marketing in its traditional form, but this was not the case. A full review of \nthe interview transcripts revealed that virtually all respondents had completed some form \nof training in the area and were familiar with \u2018technical\u2019 marketing language. The \nresearch found however, that the common form of discourse used was an intelligent lay \nlanguage, as opposed to the style of expression found in marketing textbooks.  It is the \nformer which constructs reality and shapes behaviour, a mode of speech existing outside   \nthe \u2018myopia and inflexibility\u2019 of the normative marketing rhetoric (Brownlie and Saren \n2004 p2).  It can be argued therefore, that success is not just about basing marketing \nactivity on a single, \u2018right\u2019 way (Murray et al 2002). As an example, Robbin's (1991) in-\ndepth case study analysis of a family company, found that although strategic marketing \nplanning was absent, the company was prospering.  Anecdotally, this type of situation is \nwell recognised within the practitioner communities and might explain why the latter fail \nto take much notice of academic marketing research.  The evidence seems to be strong \nthat academic research in marketing fails to make much of an impression on \nmarketing practitioners. From a survey of marketing managers McKenzie et al (2002) \nconcluded that none of them regularly read an academic journal. A recent survey of \nmarketing research practitioners established that they find sources of information \nother than academic journals,  mainly  professional magazines and web sites far more \n 9\nuseful for professional purposes (Baines, et al 2006). It is significant to note that \nmarketing textbooks are nowhere mentioned in these studies as sources of prime \ninformation and assistance for practitioners. \n \nAnother central article of faith promulgated in textbooks is based on one which suggests \nthe environment can be represented and analysed in an objective manner. In most \nmarketing texts, (eg Dibb and Simkin et al 2006), there is a chapter which represents the \nenvironment and its constituent factors in a relatively straightforward and unambiguous \nfashion. Weick (1995) argues however, that the environment is subjectively perceived \nand constructed by organisational members as individual acts. Research conducted by \nKnibbs et al (1987), clearly highlighted how different managers within the same \norganisation construct significantly different organisational analyses, even though they \nare all supposedly describing the same external environments. For Gummesson (1987), \neach marketing situation is unique.  If managers do not notice, or are not concerned by \ncertain environmental events, then they will not be acted upon. Weick (1995), points out \nthat the rational, prescriptive  model, which is prevalent in most marketing textbooks, \nassumes a mass of data is collected on the business environment. This is not always the \ncase in practice. One manager in the study spoke for many when he was asked if he \ncompleted an environmental analysis. He replied by saying \u201cNo, No\u2026I just want to \nknow how the opposition is disposed around me\u2026.\u201d In this study, the business \nenvironment was not found to be a fixed objective entity, but embedded in the local \nrationality of marketing managers worlds. This is a result of the pragmatic acceptance \nof what is reasonable and achievable, by organisational members. Textbooks fail to \ncapture this complexity and ambiguity, relying instead on the presentation of \n 10\nsimplistic models which fail to explain the reality of practitioner perceptions of the \nworld. \n \nAn additional key article of the textbook faith is represented by the strategic planning \ntools. In most marketing textbooks, it seems obligatory for firms to carry out a portfolio \nanalysis. (see Brassington and Pettitt 2005pp399-404; Kotler and Wong et al 2005 pp60-\n63).  These are ubiquitous in the modern marketing textbook, despite a critical crescendo \nas to their relevance. Morrison and Wensley (1991) argue it is an approach which \n\u2018boxes in\u2019 strategic thinking and is an outmoded orthodoxy. Additionally, the Boston \nmatrix is criticised as being too narrow and difficult to work with. Whilst Brown \n(2001p93) has noted that the `bloom is going off boxes\u2019 matrices are very resilient. \nFor some of the managers in this study, it is clear that decisions are based on an \nalternative, intuitive, tacit approach, rather than on the use of boxes.  At Vincent Duke, a \nmajor financial services company, the marketing manager indicated that strategic \nthinking does not primarily come from the planning tools. \n \n \u201c \u2026most of us really do our marketing thinking by just imagining how we would  feel \nas a customer, and that has given us an awful lot of what we need to know and \nunderstand, to move the company on.\" \n \nThere is little evidence that marketing textbooks even acknowledge this approach to \ndecision making let alone discuss it. The case is that intuition and tacit knowledge \noften developed in local contexts, do not sit well with overarching, explicit rationalist \nframeworks. For Jason Hobart of Stirling Publisher, there is also a role for intuition, and \n 11\nexperience in, for example, the new product development process. He makes the point \nthat, \n \n\u2026 at the end of the day, one of the many values of the publishing team...is they have a \ngut feel for what is going to work and what isn't going to work, and even at the micro \nlevel, looking at the cover of a book, they can sense whether it is going to work or not, \nso I believe there is a role for making those sort of judgement calls...\" \n \nHackley (2000) in his study of work in an advertising agency, indicated how central tacit \nknowledge is to marketing decision making. In addition he states (Hackley 1999), that \nthe tacit area of practical knowledge refers to action which is left out of abstracted \ntheoretical descriptions, but on which the accomplishment of action depends. He \ncontends that high level practical knowledge in this area is tacit. He goes on to point out \nthat a person who is highly accomplished in strategic marketing decision making, is \nlikely to be able to utilise sophisticated and experientially mediated concepts in coping \nwith marketing issues. These implicit features of marketing knowledge are \nsystematically ignored in textbooks, where the emphasis is still put on the four Ps of the \nmarketing mix as frameworks for understanding, see for example Jobber (2004) and \nBrassington and Pettitt (2005). This is despite concerted argument which suggests the \nconcept is increasingly moribund (Gronross 1994; Brownlie and Saren 1992).  Managers \nin the study here often referred to the inadequacy of a four Ps approach. At Stirling \nPublisher, Jason Hobart, the marketing director, pointes out that,  \n \n\u201cin the marketing plan you will not see the four Ps\u2026it becomes a  bit slavish\u2026. I \nwould rather talk about understanding markets, understanding how you reach end \n 12\nusers, and understanding how you continue your business as usual; sales to those \nmarkets, how you get incremental sales to those markets, how you get loyalty, so \nduring the year we have got a growing loyal base.\u201d \n  \nThe notion of social reality as a constellation of pluralities, suggests that knowledge is \noften personal and subjective. A consequence of this is that each marketing manager \nhere has a reservoir of wisdom which is embedded within the context of their own \norganisation. This may not be able to be codified into one overarching marketing reality, \nbut into many. This is a point most textbooks ignore. From the study here, one manager \nspeaking for many, explains why he does not use the analytical marketing tools. Jerry \nCourt of Morris Grout, a major building contractor in the locality of the study, points to \nthe key role of on going relationships in determining marketing actions. For him, the \nBoston matrix is,   \n \n\"...good to talk about over the dinner table maybe, but I didn't really find there was \nproper use for it. I have been with the company twenty five years, I know what we can \ndo and I hope I can pass that out to the people in my department, and it is a matter of \ngetting out, finding out who to talk to, going to see them, building relationships, and you \ndo that as much by personality as Boston matrixes...\"   \n \nGummesson (2002) is critical of the way relationships and networks are dealt with in \nmarketing textbooks. He argues that the area has still not made any substantial impact, \nwith relationship marketing often appearing as adjunct chapter at the end.  This may be \noverstating the case. None of the following have a whole chapter devoted to relationship \nmarketing; Brassington and Pettitt (2005), Dibb and Simkin et al (2006), Jobber (2004). \n 13\nGiven Gummesson\u2019s point that business is a primarily a network of relationships, the \nreductionist logic inherent in the marketing textbook is fundamentally wrong. For \nGilmore et al. (2001), networks are an important way in which marketing decisions \nare made. Their study indicates that SME marketing decision making is built around \nspontaneity, reactivity, informality and looseness. As a result of the interviews carried \nout with the managers of this study, there is no reason to suggest that networks are not \na major way in which marketing decisions are made in all types of businesses, not just \nsmall ones.  \n \n The case is that the conventional strategic planning models of the textbooks emphasise \na simple systemic approach. They do not capture the complex nature of lived reality and \nthe strategy-making process which exists within the network approach to marketing \n(Wensley 1995; Moller and Halinen 2000). Here, the emphasis is not on general \nprescription but, rather, on description and understanding, in an attempt to explain how \ninstitutions and individuals interact in inter-firm relationships (Ellis and Meyer, 2001). \nAt Mitre Technics, one of Business to business firms in the study, it is almost \nimpossible just to base marketing on a simple general planning model, as each \ncustomer has to be dealt with individually. Relationships span documents and they \nalso span years. Gordon Willis, the managing director, indicates that, \n \n\"...everything is sold to a different specification to every customer...a lot of long term \ncontracts and you have to write very detailed customer plans and  quality plans for a \ncontract...we are currently writing contracts now, that will  run for another eight or \nten years...\u201d \n \n 14\nArguably, a key relationship within the organisation is the internal market.   Although \nthe debate about this area  has been present for some considerable time (see (Ahmed \nand Rafiq 2004; Piercy and Morgan 1994), it has still not yet appeared as a mainstream \ntopic in marketing textbooks, As Robin Cawley marketing director of a major \nfinancial services comments,   \n \n\u201c\u2026your own people, who at the end of the day are the make or break of your \ncompany, because that is who the customer and the retailer will touch\u2026.and if they \ndon\u2019t agree with what the company is doing? ...internal marketing is incredibly \nimportant, that is counted as almost the thing that most marketing textbooks ignore.\u201d \n \nAs with relationship marketing generally, most textbooks do not give internal marketing \nmuch attention, let alone a separate chapter. The failure to deal with this topic fully, with \nits emphasis on people, their often diverse perceptions and motivations at work, means \nthat textbook marketing isolates itself from the interdisciplinary nature of practice. \nSomehow, magically, employees fit easily into the configurations of the organisations \nmarketing system. They disappear into a theoretical structure which views them as mere \nsystem functionaries, blindly carrying out tasks like puppets. \n \nAnother area of considerable neglect in the study of marketing decision making in \ntextbooks, (which is linked to relationship and network activity), is the role of talk. \nHackley (2003a), makes a very significant point then, when he argues that the enacted \ncomplexities of marketing are reduced in texts to the endless reproduction of abstract \nprinciples, where the process of talk is ignored. This neglect continues unabated, \ndespite the fact that as early as 1973, Mintzberg showed that management decision \n 15\nmaking is characterised by brief encounters, with the emphasis on verbal interaction. \nAs Boden (1994p52) points out, the main activity of managers in organisations is not \nplanning, but talking. Managers \"talk their way to solutions, talk themselves into \nworking agreements, talk their coalitions into existence, talk their organisational \nagendas.  \n \nIn the study here, talk was found to be a central aspect of marketing decision making.  \nVaara et al., (2004) note that much existing research into strategy ignores the \ndiscursive practices of individuals. King (2003), points out that in organisational \ntheory, the role of text is dominant over that of talking. Des Arkwright, director of \nleisure marketing at `Newfound\u2019 City Council, indicates that talk is intrinsic to his \nwork. \n \n\u201cMainly it is talking, I do a lot of that anyway, I suppose. Mainly for me it is \ninternally and externally, there are an awful lot of meetings for example with \nmembers, colleagues, with employers. So an awful lot of talking internally, with \nvarious people and an awful lot with partners, potential partners and again I mean last \nweek we had a company come down from  Scotland who  would like to build \nfacilities, maybe in some of our parks, and there was a lot   of talking to them...quite a \nbit of talking to communities...\" \n \nExplicit theories of marketing contained in textbooks, dealing with high level strategic \ndevelopment fail to engage with the notion of the socially mediated nature of \nknowledge, where talk is central to decision making. In the texts, decision making is \nlinear, variables can be easily isolated and technical rationality dominates the process of \n 16\nunderstanding (Cunningham 1999). In contrast, for Weick (1995), the sense that \nmanagers make of their world is not rooted in theoretical models, but in talk, reflexivity \nand the ongoing nature of events, where managers are always in the middle of things. \nStrategy becomes observed patterns in past decision behaviour and is not a future \nconstructed now, and then subsequently implemented. Most marketing textbooks seem \nto operate on this implicit assumption. Guy Martin of Media K a marketing and design \nconsultancy suggests how important retrospect is to decision making.  \n \n\u201cIf  you are wandering along with your army, fighting your battles and all that, at \nsome point you have got to go over the next hill and see what is there and look back \nand see how you are.\" \n \nSignificantly, what this additionally demonstrates is that textbooks fail in capturing the \nnarratives through which marketers make sense of their world. An important body of \nresearch in organisations has been carried out, showing the extent of storytelling in \norganisations (see Boland and Tenkasi 1995; Hopkinson 2003; Skoldberg 1994). The \ntextbooks emphasise normative marketing theory where people appear devoid of their \ninterpretative, narrative based selves.  As Patterson and Brown (2005) point out though, \ntelling tales is central to successful communication. The problem is that marketing \nacademics seem to have forgotten this important fact when they come to write their \ntextbooks. This study found that managers frequently resorted to stories when recounting \ntheir experiences. If managers think in story telling modes, they why is this not reflected \nin texts?  One of the services marketing managers in the study commented on how \npeople go about making meaning in their organisation, using stories. It shows that the \n 17\nnormative textbook theory, which makes ubiquitous use of the bullet point, fails to \ncapture the narrative basis of rhetorical practice within companies. \n \n\u201cPeople think narratively, we do not think in bullet points\u2026what bullet points lack are \nthe broader explanations which people need\u2026in terms of my staff having to \nimplement plans, people will say \u2018I worked for so and so and this is how we did it, \ncan we do something like that here\u2019. People rarely say we must achieve this or that \nratio or percentage rate, but people will tell each other stories about retention rates \ninstead.\u201d \n \nMarketing is essentially about good communications and here there is a paradox if we \nthink about the role of the textbook. Brands are built on good stories (Brown 2005). \nAre textbooks, however, helping to develop the marketing storytellers of the future?  \nThe reliance in the textbooks on generalised, unimaginative theories, bewildering \nboxes and a variety of mystic matrices, are unlikely to provide budding marketers \nwith the facility to provide the consumer with an inspiring vision of a company\u2019s \nproducts and services. Textbooks not only fail to reflect reality, but they are also \ndoing a disservice to those about to enter the field, or are new to it.  \n \nCONCLUSION:  TEXTS AND CONTEXT IN MARKETING  \n \nAs individuals in society we interpret and order our knowledge in different ways \n(Berger and Luckman 1966), so it is questionable to think that marketing knowledge \nshould be represented any differently. It can be argued that the knowledge base of \nmarketing is in fact always contingent and tentative, rather than permanent and \n 18\noverarching. Gummesson (2002), argues that scholars are like Flying Dutchmen, \ndoomed to travel, never being allowed to dock in a harbour. The search for and belief \nin a general theory of marketing is illusory, when confronted by the reality of \nmarketing managers local experiences and knowledge. Textbooks must try to capture \nthis aspect of reality, if they are to present marketing with integrity. The argument \nwhich states the role of textbooks is to present sets of handy mnemonics is a tired one. \nTextbooks need to reflect marketing reality more closely and more rigorously. The \nneed is of course for this new knowledge to be captured and disseminated. This is \nperhaps a major challenge facing marketing orthodoxy today. Textbooks need \nreinvigorating to include rich ethnographic accounts of marketing as it is carried out \nin a variety of organisations. Here the discipline has to draw much more fully on the \ninterpretative tradition. We are likely as a consequence of the latter approach, to end \nup with competing theories of what marketing is. This can only add value to the \nsubject both as an academic endeavour and as an applied field. If this complicates \nmarketing, making it more interdisciplinary and demanding for learners, then this is a \nchallenge worth facing, a point endorsed by McCole (2004). As a result, a new \nethnographically informed marketing could be based on the changing common sense \npractices of social actors and not within a static, reified theory. In addition, it should \nbe possible to write new forms of the marketing textbook on the basis of studying \nwhat goes on in communities of practice (Wenger and Synder 2000). Here, theory \nemerges from practices based in social participation, rather than out of abstracted \nprinciples. \n \n As Brown (2006b) entertainingly illustrates, out there in business are a lot of \nsuccessful marketing people who have never come across traditional textbook theory. \n 19\nThis rich source of new knowledge and theory for marketing needs capturing. Brief \nand Dukerich (1991), make a very significant  point when they say that  theory should \nnot be about advocating one useful way to do things in an applied setting, as many \ncurrent marketing textbooks suggest, but should be about being able to offer up \nvarious courses of action. This can be achieved if textbooks draw more directly on the \nperceptions of individuals who practice marketing for real. \n \nAs yet, few newer marketing textbooks, with some exceptions, (see Blythe 2006; \nPalmer 2004), appear to be about attempts to pursue different agendas. The latter \nbook for example, places relationships in much more of a pivotal position than many \nother established texts, while the former takes a critical perspective on some \nestablished aspects of  prescriptive theory, through the use of \u2018talking points\u2019 \nthroughout the text. In general though, it seems to be the case that most marketing \ntextbooks suffer from a case of mistaken identity. Their characteristics are purported \nto be about the reality of marketing management, yet the research interviews here \nsuggest that what is on offer, bears little resemblance to the actual practical world. An \nobstinate form of positivism holds sway with many marketing scholars (Tapp et al \n2006).  It appears to be a paradigm resistant to change, particularly in the case of \ntextbooks.  \n \nResults from the interviews in this study suggest that the textbook format currently in \nuse needs a radical rethink then, in order to incorporate the interpreted realities of \nmarketer\u2019s activity. Thick descriptions could be the basis of new and different \ntheories of marketing which are rooted in the lived world of the practitioner and not in \nabstract theory. This approach has the potential to enliven a field which currently \n 20\nlacks much diversity, beyond well worn platitudes in many texts which state that \nservices are different to physical products, and consumer markets are different from \nbusiness markets. Scholars who write marketing textbooks should be unpicking the \nmessy reality of marketing practice and attempting to understand how for example, \ntwo companies who sell similar products may have very different marketing \napproaches. Some important implications stem then from examining the local \ncontexts in which marketing operates. Textbooks are required which reflect the lived \nreality of marketing manager\u2019s worlds. Central to this enterprise are language and the \nlocal logic of action. Fuller, richer descriptions of meaning and action should be \npresented in the textbooks, ones which reflect the ambiguity and paradoxes of reality. \nTerse theory can only ever be a superficial representation of events, presenting to \nlearners a pristine, technically rational world that does not bear much relation to \nreality. Managers in this study have provided some rich insights into their own \npersonal views of marketing theory and practice and this approach could be further \nextended to provide marketing learners with deep contextual information about the \nmanagement of marketing.  If marketing scholars do not attempt to move towards \nsome of the approaches suggested here, then the theory practice gap in the discipline \nwill remain as wide as ever \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 21\nREFERENCES  \n \n \nAHMED, P.K.
