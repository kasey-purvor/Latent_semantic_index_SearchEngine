INTRODUCTION\nSynchronization is a fundamental phenomenon in the\nphysics of oscillations. It manifests not only in physics, but\nalso in biology, chemistry, and many other branches of sci-\nence and engineering. It can involve coupled or forced peri-\nodic \u00031,2\u0004, chaotic \u00033\u20135\u0004, and even stochastic self-oscillators\n\u00036\u0004. Synchronization implies an adjustment of the basic time\nscales of systems due to coupling between them. For peri-\nodic oscillations \u0001the simplest case\u0002, synchronization can be\nattributed to certain bifurcations on an invariant ergodic\ntorus. Two basic mechanisms of synchronization can be dis-\ntinguished: phase (frequency) locking, which is associated\nwith a saddle-node \u0001fold\u0002 bifurcation of a saddle cycle and a\nstable limit cycle on the torus surface, and suppression of the\nnatural dynamics, when an ergodic torus collapses into a\nlimit cycle via a torus death \u0001Neimark-Sacker\u0002 bifurcation\n\u00032,7\u0004.\nThe dynamics of mutually coupled periodic oscillators is\nhighly complex. In addition to synchronization, diverse phe-\nnomena such as amplitude death \u00038\u0004, chaotic oscillations \u00039\u0004,\nand phase multistability \u000310\u0004 can occur. Phase multistability\nmeans that, even for precisely the same set of control param-\neters, the interacting oscillators can be synchronized with\ndifferent phase shifts depending on the initial conditions,\nwhich means that several synchronous attractors can coexist\nin their joint phase space. Phase multistability can even take\nplace in the simple case of two mutually coupled Van der Pol\noscillators \u000310\u0004.\nAlthough the general mechanisms for mutual synchroni-\nzation have been intensively studied, there remain a number\nof unsolved fundamental problems. In particular, it is known\nthat inside the locking region the coexisting limit cycles usu-\nally live on the surface of the same torus, their basins of\nattraction being separated by the manifolds of saddle cycles\nlying on the same torus. It is equally well established that, as\none leaves the locking region and enters the suppression re-\ngion, the saddle cycles with their delimiting manifolds dis-\nappear through a bifurcation. However, phase multistability\ncontinues to exist. So several questions immediately arise:\nAs one crosses the boundary between locking and suppres-\nsion, how does the structure of phase space change? What\nbifurcations accompany this change? What separates the ba-\nsins of attraction of the coexisting limit cycles?\nNote that the coexistence of different limit sets inside the\nsynchronization region is a very general phenomenon that is\nobserved in many interacting systems with diverse forms of\ncoupling \u000311\u201316\u0004, so that these are important questions of\nconsiderable general interest. Most works on phase multista-\nbility study the case of weak linear coupling, for which syn-\nchronzation is realized via frequency\/phase locking; it re-\nmains unclear how the phase space structure evolves in the\ncases of large coupling and\/or nonlinear coupling.\nIn this paper we study the simplest representative example\nof two periodic mutually coupled oscillators with either lin-\near or nonlinear coupling, which describes the general case\nof coexisting limit cycles and of associated bifurcational\ntransitions. We reveal the phase space structure of the system\nunder study, allowing us to explain the phenomena men-\ntioned above. In Sec. II we introduce the system to be stud-\nied and identify explicitly the questions to which we seeks\nanswers. In Sec. III we discuss the form of phase space nec-\nessary to account for the observed phenomena and thus pro-\nvide answers to the questions posed. In order to validate the\nhypothesized phase space structure, it is analyzed in detail\nand subjected to a variety of tests in Sec. IV. It is shown to be\nself-consistent and to meet all requirements. In Sec. V we\ncheck the generality of our results considering other example\nof coupled oscillators. Finally, in Sec. VI, the work is sum-\nmarized and conclusions are drawn.\nII. SYSTEM UNDER STUDY AND QUESTIONS POSED\nAs a paradigm for a pair of coupled, periodic, self-\nsustained oscillators, we consider two mutually coupled Van\nder Pol systems:\n*Corresponding author.

However, in order to\nestimate how a more complex coupling influences the coex-\nisting regimes and their evolution, we also consider a non-\nlinear interaction where the coupling function includes a\nquadratic term. Although in what follows we fix equal non-\nlinearities \u00011=\u00012=0.5, all results reported below were also\nreproduced for unequal nonlinearities, \u00011=0.5 and \u00012=0.52.\nWe choose \u0002=1, and change p around 1 in order to study the\nbasic 1 :1 synchronization region. For these parameter values\nthere are six cycles involved: two stable cycles that we fur-\nther refer to as S1,2, two saddle cycles \u0001with one unstable\ndirection\u0002 S1,2\n*\n, and two \u201cdouble-saddle\u201d cycles \u0001with two\nunstable directions\u0002 U1,2. These cycles can undergo two\ntypes of bifurcation: fold while merging in pairs \u0001S1,2 with\nS1,2\n*\n, or S1,2\n* with U1,2\u0002, or torus birth \u0001S1,2 only\u0002.\nIn the bifurcation diagrams shown in Figs. 1\u20133, shaded\nregions mark the absence of 1:1 synchronization and will\nnot be considered further in the present work.\nA. Linear coupling and multistability\nFirst, we study linear mutual coupling by setting C2=0. In\nthe p-C1 parameter plane the region of phase locking \u0001the\nmain part of Fig. 1\u0002 \u000317\u0004 is outlined by full lines on which\nfold bifurcations between different pairs of cycles occur.\nDashed lines mark torus birth bifurcation and enclose the\nregion of suppression. At very small C1, the locking region\nlooks like a classical Arnol\u2019d tongue. However, at larger C1\nanother narrower \u201ctongue\u201d can be found, embedded within\nthe first one.\nWithin the smaller tongue S1 and S2 coexist on the surface\nof the same stable torus, separated by S1\n* and S2\n*\n, while U1,2\nlive in the neighborhood. To illustrate how cycles appear\/\ndisappear within and at the boundaries of the phase-locking\nregion, we follow routes A and B in Fig. 1, as marked by the\ndotted lines. Insets show evolution of cycles maxima xmax\nalong the routes.

Along route B \u0001the right-\nhand inset of Fig. 1\u0002 all six cycles undergo fold bifurcations.\nAbove the upper border of the phase-locking region at C1\n\u00050.192, there are only two cycles S1,2 left, both stable.\nIt is evident from the right-hand inset of Fig. 1 that, for\nC1=0.2, p=1.002 \u0001i.e., inside the suppression region\u0002, two\nstable limit cycles S1,2 coexist in phase space. However,\nthere are no saddle cycles S1,2\n* whose stable manifolds could\nseparate the basins of attraction. So the following question\narises: What separates the basins of attraction here?\nB. Nonlinear coupling and disappearance of a stable torus\nNow let us take account of nonlinear coupling. We have\ntwo coupling parameters C1 and C2, and one detuning pa-\nrameter p, so the control parameter space of interest becomes\nthree dimensional. Consequently, we will have bifurcation\nsurfaces rather than lines. Because it is difficult to visualize\nsurfaces of such intricate shape intertwining in the three-\ndimensional \u00013-D\u0002 parameter space, we show four represen-\ntative sections in the plane p-C2 at four fixed values of C1\n\u0001Fig. 2\u0002. One can see that at C1=0, i.e., when the coupling is\nquadratic without a linear component, the synchronization\ntongue possesses the classical shape that exists in a harmoni-\ncally forced periodic oscillator. It is even simpler than for\npurely linear coupling \u0001cf. Fig. 1\u0002 and has single-leaf struc-\nture, implying the absence of phase multistability. As C1 in-\ncreases, however, the bifurcation diagram becomes more in-\nvolved, with new bifurcation lines appearing, crossing each\nother, and merging. Also, in some parts of the diagrams two\nstable objects evidently coexist in the phase space, with the\ndiagrams becoming multileaf. In each of Figs. 2\u0001a\u0002\u20132\u0001d\u0002, an\nincrease of C2 eventually leads to the disappearance of one\nof the coexisting periodic regimes as a result of a certain\nbifurcation, so that the diagram becomes single leaf.\nConsider in more detail the lower part of the diagram for\nC1=0.2 \u0001Fig. 3\u0002. The left and right-hand borders of the syn-\nchronization region are formed by lines of fold bifurcations\nof pairs of cycles S1,2 with S1,2\n*\n, and of S1,2\n* with U1,2, as\nshown by full lines. On dashed lines, stable cycles S1,2 lose\ntheir stability via Neimark-Sacker bifurcations. The latter can\neither be supercritical, leading to the birth of stable tori, or\nsubcritical not resulting in a torus birth.\nNote that the point C1=0.2, C2=0 , p=1.002 in Figs. 2\nand 3 is in fact identical with point C1=0.2, p=1.002 in Fig.\n1. Thus the same limit cycles S1,2 coexist here as those illus-\ntrated on the right-hand inset of Fig. 1 at C1=0.2.\nIn Fig. 3, on the almost horizontal segment of dashed line,\nthe stable cycle S2 undergoes a Neimark-Sacker bifurcation.\nIf after crossing the dashed line one finds oneself in the re-\ngion bounded by a dashed line from below, and by full grey\n\u0001green online\u0002 from above \u0001see the inset of Fig. 3\u0002, a stable\ntorus T2 is born, and the cycle S2 becomes a double-saddle\ncycle \u0001we mark its instability by an overtilde: S\u02dc2\u0002. An inter-\nesting component of this bifurcation diagram is the full grey\n\u0001green online\u0002 line on which T2 disappears via a bifurcation.\nSince the latter is not of a cycle, but of a torus, the corre-\nsponding line was obtained not by a continuation algorithm,\nbut by observing phase portraits and marking the parameter\nvalues at which T2 vanished. Remarkably, there is no sign of\ntorus distortion or of the quasiperiod tending to infinity be-\nfore the bifurcation, as usually accompany homoclinic bifur-\ncations: the torus vanishes while remaining smooth and of\nfinite size. So the question here is as follows: Why does the\ntorus disappear?\nIII. HYPOTHESIZED STRUCTURE OF THE PHASE\nSPACE\nTo answer the questions posed in Sec. II, we have to\nreveal the structure of phase space, and to show that it allows\nfor all observed bifurcations of limit cycles and provides a\nseparating surface for the coexisting stable cycles in the re-\ngion of suppression. This structure should also explain the\nsudden disappearance of the smooth torus T2.\nThe main facts to be accounted for are as follows.\n\u00011\u0002 Both stable cycles S1,2, together with both single-\nsaddle cycles S1,2\n* lie on the same torus, as illustrated by the\nleft-hand inset of Fig. 1.\n\u00012\u0002 As partly illustrated by insets of Fig. 1, any single-\nsaddle cycle S1,2\n* is able to merge, either with any stable\ncycle S1,2, or with any double-saddle cycle U1,2.\nFrom facts \u00011\u0002 and \u00012\u0002 we hypothesise that, inside the\ncentral part of locking region of Fig. 1 containing point \u00011\u0002,\nthere exist two different tori in the phase space, in contrast to\nthe single torus in the case of a forced 2-dimensional system.\nOf these, the first is an attracting resonant torus whose di-\nmension is 2 and whose surface is formed by the\n2-dimensional unstable manifolds of the single-saddle cycles\nS1,2\n* that close on stable cycles S1,2. A sketch of its Poincar\u00e9\nsection is shown in Fig. 4\u0001a\u0002 by the full black closed curve;\ncircles mark the positions of cycles. This resonant torus is\nsimilar to that which exists in a forced system, but now,\ninstead of one pair of cycles, it has two pairs of cycles lying\non it.\nThe second torus is a saddle resonant torus, also of di-\nmension 2. In the Poincar\u00e9 section a two-dimensional saddle\ntorus will look like a saddle cycle, and its manifolds will\nlook like those of a saddle cycle. A section of a resonant\nsaddle torus is sketched in Fig. 4\u0001b\u0002 together with its mani-\nfolds. In the full phase space, a saddle torus is the intersec-\nFIG. 4. \u0001Color online\u0002 Sketches of Poincar\u00e9 sections of \u0001a\u0002 the\nattracting resonant torus T, \u0001b\u0002 the saddle resonant torus T* shown\nas a closed grey \u0001green online\u0002 curve, and its manifolds shown as\nsurfaces. The circles indicate cycles: filled ones represent the stable\ncycles S1,2; open ones represent the single-saddle cycles S1,2\n* ; and\ngrey \u0001green online\u0002 ones represent the double-saddle cycles U1,2.\nROLE OF SADDLE TORI IN THE MUTUAL\u2026 PHYSICAL REVIEW E 72, 026214 \u00012005\u0002\n026214-3\ntion of two three-dimensional manifolds. We note that the\nminimum dimension of the phase space into which a three-\ndimensional manifold can be embedded, and thus where a\nsaddle torus could exist, is four dimensional\u2014which is in-\ndeed the dimension of the system, Eqs. \u00011\u0002, under study.\nThe manifolds that cross to form a saddle torus play a\nvery important role, and they need to be revealed. However,\ntheir dimension is 3, so that they cannot be visualized though\nprojection from the four-dimensional to the three-\ndimensional space. For this reason, throughout this paper,\ninstead of showing projections of the objects involved, we\nwill show their Poincar\u00e9 sections. Thus cycles will turn into\npoints, tori into closed curves, and three-dimensional mani-\nfolds into surfaces in three-dimensional space.\nWe hypothesize that the two tori intersect at the single-\nsaddle cycles S1,2\n* as shown in Fig. 5\u0001a\u0002.\n\u00013\u0002 Given facts 1 and 2, both tori should lie on the same\nclosed hypersurface \u0001\u201csphere\u201d\u0002. The latter is the unstable\nmanifold of the saddle torus sketched as the cylinder in Fig.\n4\u0001b\u0002 which, instead of going to infinity, should be closed\nfrom below and from above. This \u201csphere\u201d would then be a\ncentral manifold for the Neimark-Sacker bifurcation of the\nstable cycle S2 on the dashed line in Fig. 3.\nThe Poincar\u00e9 section of the hypothesised structure in the\nthree-dimensional space is sketched in Fig. 5\u0001a\u0002. Here, cycles\nare given by circles: black\u2014S1,2, white\u2014S1,2\n*\n, grey \u0001green\nonline\u0002\u2014U1,2. Full closed curves show tori. Surfaces show\nmanifolds of the saddle torus: horizontal plane\u2014stable, and\nsphere\u2014unstable manifolds, respectively.\nIf the structure shown in Fig. 5\u0001a\u0002 is correct, the stable\nmanifold of the saddle torus shown as a plane is the sought-\nafter surface separating the basins of the two coexisting\ncycles S1,2. Although the proposed structure is self-consistent\nand would provide an elegant answer to the above questions,\nits existence needs to be verified. The best way to do this is\nto try to visualize the structure numerically. However, at the\nmoment there seems to be no numerical method available\nthat would allow one to visualize a saddle torus. We there-\nfore require a way to plot the inferred saddle torus using\nwhat we know about the system and exploiting all necessary\nimplications of the hypothesized structure\u2019s existence. We\naddress this problem in the next section.\nIV. VERIFYING THE HYPOTHESIZED STRUCTURE OF\nTHE PHASE SPACE\nA. Structure at linear coupling with multistability\nFirst, we note that our hypothesis assumes two pairs of\ncycles S1,2 and S1,2\n* lying on the same closed curve \u0001the reso-\nnant torus\u0002 T. An indication of this can be seen in Fig. 1\n\u0001inset A\u0002 showing that with the change in p all four cycles\nmove along the same closed curve. However, the assumption\nmust also be verified for fixed system parameters. A resonant\ntorus can be visualized numerically with the help of an ex-\nisting technique \u000318\u0004 that involves surrounding the torus by a\nclosed surface and following its evolution in time. Since T is\nan attracting structure as a whole, and despite the real attrac-\ntors being cycles S1,2 lying on it, the closed surface will tend\neventually to coincide with the torus. Performing this calcu-\nlation for C2=0, p=1.002, and C1=0.15 in Eq. \u00011\u0002 \u0001point 1 in\nFig. 1\u0002, we obtained a closed curve in the Poincar\u00e9 section\n\u0001the black curve in Fig. 5\u0001b\u0002\u0002 representing the torus T sought.\nAs an independent test of validity of this torus, we plot the\ncycles S1,2 and S1,2\n* in the same figure to show that they do\nindeed lie on the closed curve found.\nSecond, we note that, to enable trajectories from inside\nthe sphere to be attracted to its surface, a repelling object\nshould exist inside it; and, indeed, it can be easily shown that\nthere is a repelling fixed point at the origin. If time is re-\nversed, a repeller becomes an attractor; and, if the hypoth-\nesized sphere exists, it will become the boundary between\nthe basins of attraction of the fixed point and of infinity. We\nwere thus able to compute the basin of attraction of the fixed\npoint in reversed time for the above parameters, and esti-\nmated its boundary numerically. This indeed appeared to be a\nclosed surface topologically equivalent to a sphere \u0001not\nshown, to avoid overloading the figures\u0002.\nThird, if the hypothesized picture is true, both the stable\ntorus T and double-saddle cycles U1,2 should lie on the\nsphere. T should divide the sphere into two halves, each\ncontaining one of the double-saddle cycles, a conclusion that\nwas verified within our numerical accuracy.\nFourth, the manifold sketched in Fig. 5\u0001a\u0002 as a plane sepa-\nrating the basins of attraction of coexisting limit cycles S1\nand S2, can be calculated in a similar way to that used for the\nsphere, through a calculation of the basins. The surface thus\nfound \u0001again, not shown\u0002 was indeed not closed, at least\nwithin the relevant part of phase space.\nFifth, if the saddle torus exists, it should be a closed curve\nat which the surfaces found above intersect each other. We\nhave established that the sphere and the plane do indeed\nintersect, and have estimated their points of intersection nu-\nmerically, yielding the closed curve shown in Fig. 5\u0001b\u0002 by\ngrey \u0001green online\u0002, that is supposedly the saddle torus T*\nbeing sought \u0001cf.

PHYSICAL REVIEW E 72, 026214 \u00012005\u0002\n026214-4\nFinally, the saddle torus T* should intersect with the stable\ntorus T at cycles S1,2\n*\n, and U1,2 should lie on its surface as\nwell. This too appears to be true within numerical accuracy\n\u0001compare Fig. 5\u0001b\u0002 with Fig. 5\u0001a\u0002\u0002. Because the calculation\nof basins of attraction does not require knowledge of the\npositions of cycles S1,2\n* and U1,2, the fact that they were\nfound to be in the expected places provides another indepen-\ndent argument supporting the validity of the structure under\nconsideration.\nOur hypothesized structure of phase space in the central\npart of the locking region for two mutually coupled periodic\noscillators is thus shown to be valid. This structure provides\nthe answer to the question: What separates the basins of\nattraction of coexisting limit cycles S1,2 in the region of sup-\npression lying above all the full lines in the upper part of the\nbifurcation diagram of Fig. 1? In this region, the saddle\ncycles S1,2\n* do not exist, having merged with the double-\nsaddle cycles U1,2 via fold bifurcations. However, the saddle\ntorus on which all the above cycles lived continues to exist\nas an ergodic one, and thus provides the required three-\ndimensional stable manifold that serves as a delimiting sur-\nface.\nB. Structure at nonlinear coupling and disappearance of a\nstable torus\nNext, we consider the abrupt disappearance of the newly\nborn torus T2 under nonlinear coupling, as the grey \u0001green\nonline\u0002 line of Fig. 3 is crossed from below to above. Below\nthe dashed line lies the region of suppression, with a phase\nspace structure that is qualitatively the same as in the sup-\npression region of Fig. 1. This means that in the phase space\nthere coexist two stable cycles S1,2, and a saddle torus that is\nnow ergodic. When the torus T2 is born from S2 on the\ndashed line, the phase space structure must look like that\nsketched in Fig. 6\u0001a\u0002. Note that T2 must also lie on the\n\u201csphere\u201d since it is the central manifold of torus birth bifur-\ncation.\nAs parameter C2 is gradually increased above the value of\ntorus birth bifurcation, the torus diameter increases. How-\never, being bounded to lie on the sphere, the only opportu-\nnity for it to grow is to move toward the equator, i.e., toward\nthe saddle torus T*. The inevitable consequence is that, even-\ntually, T2 must collide with T* and disappear, which would\nimply a fold bifurcation. After that, the only attractor of the\nsystem would be the stable cycle S1.\nThis suggestion was tested by use of methods similar to\nthose resulting in Fig. 5\u0001b\u0002. For each of two sets of param-\neters inside the region where the cycle S1 and torus T2 coex-\nist, marked as points 2 and 3 in Fig. 3, the two tori were\nobtained numerically. In Fig. 6\u0001b\u0002 the phase space is illus-\ntrated for point 2, and in Fig. 6\u0001c\u0002 for point 3. It is clearly\nseen that, immediately after the torus birth bifurcation \u0001Fig.\n6\u0001b\u0002\u0002, the new torus T2 is small and is situated relatively far\nfrom the saddle torus T*. Also, it does belong to the sphere\nthat is not illustrated here. However, close to the parameter\nvalue at which T2 disappears \u0001Fig. 6\u0001c\u0002\u0002, both tori are very\nclose to each other, almost coinciding in shape and size.\nThese figures support our hypothesis of a fold bifurcation of\nthe two tori and thus provide the mechanism by which the\nstable torus disappears.\nV. GENERALITY CHECK: PHASE SPACE STRUCTURE\nIN A DIFFERENT SYSTEM\nAfter having revealed the structure of the phase space for\ntwo coupled Van der Pol oscillators, each being a paradigm\nfor periodic self-sustained oscillators, we are naturally inter-\nested to seek evidence as to whether this structure is general.\nSo we consider another system of two coupled periodic self-\noscillators, namely, two simplified FitzHugh-Nagumo sys-\ntems in their oscillatory regimes, each of the form\nx\u02d91,2 = x1,2 \u2212 x1,2\n3 \/3 \u2212 y1,2,\ny\u02d91,2 = x1,2 + a + C\u0001y2,1 \u2212 y1,2\u0002 , \u00012\u0002\nfor control parameter values a=0.1, C=0.17. Here we con-\nsider identical oscillators to ensure that they are 1:1 synchro-\nnized. At our chosen value of C=0.17 they are in fact phase\nlocked, as can be verified by a bifurcation analysis.\nAll stages of the computation were carried out in close\nanalogy with the coupled Van der Pol systems, Eqs. \u00011\u0002, de-\nscribed in Sec. IV B. The final configuration of objects found\nin the phase space is as shown in Fig. 7. One can see imme-\ndiately that the objects themselves, and their configuration,\nare just as hypothesized \u0001Fig. 5\u0001a\u0002\u0002 and are essentially the\nsame as in the coupled Van der Pol systems \u0001Fig. 5\u0001b\u0002\u0002.\nVI. CONCLUSIONS\nIn conclusion, we have revealed the structure of the joint\nphase space of two mutually coupled periodic Van der Pol\noscillators within the synchronization regime, thereby en-\nFIG. 6. \u0001Color online\u0002 Poincar\u00e9 sections of objects in the phase\nspace. \u0001a\u0002 A hypothesized structure of phase space inside the sup-\npression regime for the mutually coupled periodic oscillators, in\nparticular, inside the region containing points 2 and 3 in the inset of\nFig. 3, where a stable cycle coexists with a stable torus. \u0001b\u0002 and \u0001c\u0002\nA numerically revealed structure of the phase space at parameter\nvalues corresponding to points 2 and 3 in Fig. 3, respectively.

II. We have shown that, quite generally, there are\ntwo tori lying on the same closed manifold, intersecting to\nform an elegant structure. All evolutions of synchronous at-\ntractors are closely associated with bifurcations of solutions\nbelonging to either saddle tori, or stable tori, or both, or of\nthe tori themselves. As discussed in Sec. V, the same phase\nspace structure was also revealed in two coupled FitzHugh-\nNagumo systems in their oscillatory regime. A deeper under-\nstanding of the physics of such interacting oscillators, and\ntheir complex mutual phase space structure, could facilitate\nthe manipulation of dynamical systems with phase multista-\nbility in a variety of practical applications, e.g., in biology\nand medicine, where phase multistability is often of vital\nimportance \u00034,11\u0004.\nIn addition, we have introduced a method of visualizing\nsaddle tori that could prove useful in the wide variety of\nproblems where such objects appear.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe work was supported by Leverhulme Trust, the U.S.\nCivilian Research Development Foundation \u0001Grant No. REC\n006\u0002, and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research\nCouncil \u0001UK\u0002.\n\u00031\u0004 V.
