The high depths of cut, wheel and workpiece \nspeeds fundamentally change the cutting and contact conditions and hence the thermal behaviour \nof the process. These fundamental changes to the thermal behaviour of the process can result in \nhigh temperatures in the wheel-workpiece contact zone, which facilitate the removal of surface \nmaterial, but are subsequently removed with the grinding chip before significant penetration into \nthe workpiece surface [6-8]. \nResidual stresses generated during grinding processes can have a detrimental effect on the \nperformance and life of a ground component [9-11]. Significant reduction in fatigue life and the \ndevelopment of subsurface cracking are just a few of the problems likely to occur as a result of a \npoorly controlled grinding process. High temperatures resulting from the grinding process are \nalso the primary driver for the generation of tensile residual stress [12-15]. \nA burn threshold diagram has been proposed in the literature [16,17] based on assumptions \nderived from conventional grinding processes and for Peclet numbers below 50 as shown in \nfigure 1. Such diagrams are of particular use in defining the safe processing conditions to ensure \nthat grinding temperatures do not exceed the burn threshold temperature for the workpiece. In \nconstructing such diagrams it is assumed that all grinding energy except for 55% of the chip \nformation energy is transferred to the workpiece which is a reasonable assumption for typical \nshallow cut grinding conditions. However during HEDG processing as much as 95% of the total \ngrinding energy can be removed with the grinding chip [6,8] and Peclet numbers readily exceed \nvalues of 50. It is therefore appropriate to reconsider the burn threshold diagram for HEDG \nprocessing conditions. \nDevelopment of a Burn Threshold Diagram for HEDG \nThe burn threshold diagram for the HEDG regime was initially developed following a similar \nprocess to that described by Malkin for shallow cut grinding [16,17]. Here, the maximum \ndimensionless temperature m\u03b8  is a function of the maximum temperature incurred, where: \n2\nw\nm m\nw\nk v\nq\n\u03c0\u03b8 \u03b8\u03b1\n\u22c5 \u22c5= \u22c5\u22c5 \u22c5   (1) \n\u03b1  is the thermal diffusivity of the workpiece material and is defined by: \nk\nc\n\u03b1 \u03c1= \u22c5   (2) \nWhere k is the thermal conductivity, \u03c1 is the density and c is the specific heat capacity of the \nworkpiece material. The value vw is the workpiece feedrate and qw is the average heat flux \nentering the workpiece. \nThe maximum surface temperature m\u03b8  for the HEDG regime is taken from the circular arc of \nheat contact model of Rowe & Jin [18] (figure 2) and is given by equation 3: \nw c\nm\nw w\nq lC\nv\n\u03b8 \u03b2= \u22c5 \u22c5   (3) \nWhere lc is the contact length between the wheel and workpiece, C is the temperature constant \nfor workpiece thermal conduction quantifying the effect of contact angle and Peclet number on \nthe contact zone temperature (figure 3) and \u03b2w is described in equation 4: \nw k c\u03b2 \u03c1= \u22c5 \u22c5   (4) \nEquation 1 can be rearranged in terms of the maximum surface temperature such that: \n2 w\nm m\nw\nq\nk v\n\u03b1\u03b8 \u03b8 \u03c0\n\u22c5 \u22c5= \u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5   (5) \nCombining equations 3 and 5 produces the following relationship: \n2 w w c\nm m\nw w w\nq q lC\nk v v\n\u03b1\u03b8 \u03b8 \u03c0 \u03b2\n\u22c5 \u22c5= \u22c5 = \u22c5 \u22c5\u22c5 \u22c5   (6) \nEquation 6 can be rearranged to give the dimensionless temperature in terms of the grinding \nvariables and thermal properties of the workpiece, where: \n2\nw w c\nm\nw w w\nq k v lC\nq v\n\u03c0\u03b8 \u03b2 \u03b1\n\u22c5 \u22c5= \u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5\u22c5 \u22c5   (7) \nGiven that the Peclet number L is defined as: \n4\nw cv lL \u03b1\n\u22c5= \u22c5   (8) \nEquation 7 can be reduced to give the dimensionless temperature in simple terms: \n1\n2\nm C L\u03b8 \u03c0= \u22c5 \u22c5   (9) \nMalkin & Lenz [16] demonstrated a graphical relationship between the Peclet number and the \ndimensionless surface temperature. This is a derivation of the Jaeger model [19] and forms the \nbasis of the development of the burn threshold diagram. Figure 4 shows the original relationship \npresented by Malkin [17] compared to that derived from the circular arc of heat contact model. It \ncan be seen that the new relationship deviates from the original as a result of the inclusion of the \nC-factor and that this deviation becomes more significant as the Peclet number is increased into \nthe HEDG regime at values typically in excess of 40. \nFollowing the methodology suggested by Malkin [17], equations 1 and 9 are combined, such \nthat: \n1\n2\n2\nw\nm m\nw\nk v C L\nq\n\u03c0\u03b8 \u03b8 \u03c0\u03b1\n\u22c5 \u22c5= \u22c5 = \u22c5 \u22c5\u22c5 \u22c5   (10) \nThis can be rearranged to give the maximum contact temperature in terms of Peclet number L, \nwhere: \n1\n2\n2 w\nm\nw\nq C L\nk v\n\u03b1\u03b8 \u22c5 \u22c5= \u22c5 \u22c5\u22c5   (11) \nExpanding the Peclet number gives the temperature in terms of basic grinding parameters: \n1\n22\n4\nw w c\nm\nw\nq v lC\nk v\n\u03b1\u03b8 \u03b1\n\u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5\u239b \u239e= \u22c5 \u22c5\u239c \u239f\u22c5 \u22c5\u239d \u23a0   (12) \nContact length is estimated by: \n( ) 12c e el a d= \u22c5   (13) \nWhere ae is the depth of cut and de is the equivalent wheel diameter, for surface grinding this is \nequal to the wheel diameter. \nSubstitution into (12) gives: \n1\n1 1 2\n2 22\n4\nw w e e\nm\nw\nq v a dC\nk v\n\u03b1\u03b8 \u03b1\n\u239b \u239e\u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5= \u22c5 \u22c5\u239c \u239f\u22c5 \u22c5\u239d \u23a0\n  (14) \nSimplifying equation 14, m\u03b8  can be rewritten as: \n1 1 1\n2 4 4\n1\n2\nw e e\nm\nw\nC q a d\nk v\n\u03b1\u03b8 \u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5= \u22c5   (15) \nThe mean heat flux in the contact zone in the circular arc of heat contact model is described in \nterms of the total heat flux, where: \nw w tq R q= \u22c5   (16) \nRw is an estimation of the energy partition coefficient to the workpiece and is a factor dependent \nupon the contact conditions and material. In this review, values of Rw are determined using the \nmethodology presented by Stephenson & Jin [20]. \nSubstituting equation 16 into equation 15 gives: \n1 1 1\n2 4 4\n1\n2\nw t e e\nm\nw\nC R q a d\nk v\n\u03b1\u03b8 \u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5= \u22c5   (17) \nThe total heat flux tq  can be written in terms of the grinding parameters, where: \nw\nt c e\nc\nvq e a\nl\n= \u22c5 \u22c5   (18) \nThe specific grinding energy ec is calculated from the grinding variables and the monitored \ngrinding power Pw using equation 19: \n  \nw\nc\nw e c\nPe\nv a b\n=   (19) \nWhere bc is the grinding width. \nRecalling equation 13 and substituting equation 18 into equation 17 gives: \n31 1\n2 2 4\n1\n4\nw w e c\nm\ne\nC R v a e\nk d\n\u03b1\u03b8 \u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5= \u22c5   (20) \nGrinding burn occurs on the finished workpiece surface depending on the temperature. The \nabove derivation yields equations that predict the maximum contact temperature, which is \nappropriate if one assumes all the thermal energy in the contact surface is transferred to the \nfinished workpiece surface. The circular arc of heat contact model considers the relationship \nbetween contact and finished surface temperatures through the factor fi\/co, which accounts for the \nangle of inclination of the contact surface and the effect of workpiece speed through the Peclet \nnumber. Therefore the maximum surface temperature can be described as: \n31 1\n2 2 4\n1\n4\nfi\nco w w e c\nms\ne\nC R v a e\nk d\n\u03b1\u03b8 \u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5= \u22c5   (21) \nEquation 21 can be rearranged to give temperature change in terms of specific grinding energy, \nwhere: \n31 1\n4 2 4\n1\n2\nms\nc e w e\nke d v a\nA\n\u03b8\n\u03b1\n\u2212\u2212\u22c5= \u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5\u22c5   (22) \nWhere A is a dimensionless variable relating to contact and material condition and is equal to: \nfi\nco wA C R= \u22c5 \u22c5   (23) \nValues of C and fi\/co were calculated as a function of contact angle and Peclet number using the \ncircular arc of heat contact model [18]. \nFigure 5 applies the new approach to the grinding of SG cast iron using the conditions \nsummarised in Table 1 and demonstrates the variation between the two predicted burn threshold \nlines for a limiting temperature rise of 150\u00b0C. The resultant boundary lines represent the \nminimum specific grinding energy required for the grinding parameters to give rise to a damaged \nworkpiece surface. During the transition from conventional to HEDG grinding regimes, the \nmodel correctly predicts the occurrence of burn at very low values of specific grinding energy, \nbefore the HEDG effect becomes prevalent. A fundamental change in the threshold condition is \nexperienced at the high removal rates represented by very low values on the abscissa. This \nbehaviour is the result of the change in energy partitioning and increases in contact angle and \nPeclet number associated with the HEDG regime. As specific material removal rates increase \ninto HEDG conditions the temperature in the finished surface is reduced by an increase in the \nheat flux to the chip and the favourable contact angle. \nMaterial\u00a0 ae\u00a0(mm)\u00a0 b\u00a0(mm)\u00a0 vw\u00a0(mm\/min)\u00a0 vs\u00a0(m\/s)\u00a0 Q\u2019w\u00a0(mm\n3\/mm\u2219s)\u00a0\nSGCI\u00a0 0.5\u00a0\u2013\u00a07\u00a0 5\u00a0 2500\u00a0 150\u00a0 20\u00a0\u2013\u00a0300\u00a0\nTable 1 Grinding parameters for plot of 31 14 4 2e e wd a v\n\u2212 \u2212\u22c5 \u22c5  versus Specific Grinding Energy \nExperimental Validation \nExperimental validation was undertaken on an Edgetek Superabrasive surface grinding machine \ndesigned for the application of the HEDG process. Samples of SG Cast Iron were mounted in a \nworkpiece fixture and ground in the down grinding mode. Grinding parameters are detailed in \nTable 2. \nae\u00a0(mm)\u00a0 b\u00a0(mm)\u00a0 vw\u00a0(mm\/min)\u00a0 vs\u00a0(m\/s)\u00a0\n0.5\u00a0\u2013\u00a09\u00a0 5\u00a0\u2013\u00a02\u00a0 50\u00a0\u2013\u00a07500\u00a0 50\u00a0\u2013\u00a0150\u00a0\nTable 2 Summary of grinding parameters for burn threshold diagram trials \nApplication of the new burn threshold methodology to results for the grinding of SG Cast Iron \nsuggested a burn threshold temperature rise of 150\u00b0C.  Grinding burn was determined to have \noccurred with the onset of temper discoloration in the ground surface, which can occur at lower \ntemperatures than would cause potential damage; typical temper discoloration for SG Cast Iron \nis shown in figure 6. Using equation 22, lines of constant temperature were estimated and a \nconstant temperature threshold line of 150\u00b0C was determined. This threshold line provided the \nbest fit between the burnt and unburnt samples. Figures 7 to 9 describe the burn threshold curve \nfor values of grinding parameters at wheel speeds of 50ms\/, 100m\/s and 150 m\/s as the curve \ngeometry is variable with wheel speed. This demonstrates the boundary separating the regions of \nburnt and unburnt surfaces offers a reliable predictive capability under HEDG conditions by \ntaking into account the change in energy partitioning and increases in contact angle and Peclet \nnumber. \nGiven knowledge of the grinding parameters and the estimated value of specific grinding energy \nfrom relationships presented by Stephenson & Jin [20], the occurrence of grinding burn may be \npredicted. Improving accuracy of the burn threshold line by incorporating the latest in thermal \nmodelling techniques allows for a better definition of the burnt and unburnt regions. This \nbecomes increasingly relevant when considering that under aggressive grinding conditions \nrelatively small changes in specific grinding energy can result in large changes in surface \ntemperature moving components rapidly into burnt regions. Therefore a reliable and easy method \nof predicting the boundary is imperative for the creation of a robust method and ultimately \nsuccessful industrial application of the burn threshold technique. \nConclusions \nBy considering the fundamental changes in thermal behaviour which result from the HEDG \nprocess it has been possible to develop a new relationship between the process variables and the \nspecific grinding energy. This relationship produces an inflected curve, which allows for an \nincreased specific grinding energy before the occurrence of grinding burn when in the HEDG \nregime. \nExperimental results for SG Cast Iron demonstrate a good correlation with a predicted boundary \nfor a 150\u00b0C temperature rise. This temperature rise was estimated from the best fit between burnt \nand unburnt samples when workpieces were inspected visually. The temperature rise may be \nconsidered low; however, it is of an appropriate magnitude for the material in question. \nFurther work is required to validate this approach fully with a test programme utilising a \nquantitative method of burn validation such as x-ray diffraction or magnetic Barkhausen noise \nanalysis. This work will determine if threshold temperatures are related to time temperature \ntransformation data for specific materials. \n\u00a0\nReferences\u00a0\n1) T.
