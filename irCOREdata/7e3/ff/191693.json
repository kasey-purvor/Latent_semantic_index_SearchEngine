In this study, we have investigated the \nhypothesis that childhood leukaemia may be associated with parental germ cell sensitivity \ndetected by an increased parental germline minisatellite mutation rate. To test this we compared \nthe germline mutation rate of the hypervariable minisatellite locus, CEB1 in family trios (both \nparents and their child) of children with leukaemia (n = 109) compared with normal families (n = \n64). We found no significant difference in mean mutation rate of parents of children with \nleukaemia and control children (0.0414 vs 0.0887; P > 0.05). The majority of germline mutations \n(95%) were paternal, and unaffected by the presence of leukaemia cells in the sample. We \nfound no significant differences in mean minisatellite allele size (72 vs 68 repeats; p > 0.05), or \nmutational spectrum (gains or losses of repeats) in the parents of case and control children. \nAlthough preliminary, our results suggest that childhood leukaemia is unlikely to be associated \nwith increased germline minisatellite instability resulting from exposure of parental germ cells to \nmutagens such as IR. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2\n Introduction \nAcute leukaemia accounts for about 30% of childhood malignancies in the UK, with an average \nincidence rate of 4\/100,000\/year in the socio-economically developed countries (Little, 1999; \nStiller, 2004). Although it is thought to be initiated by unrepaired chromosome breaks following \nexposure of the fetus or infant to environmental carcinogens (Greaves, 1997; 1999), \nepidemiological studies have failed to identify specific carcinogens with any certainty. A notable \nexception involves exposure of the unborn child to X-rays in utero (Stewart et al, 1956; Stewart \nand Kneale, 1968; Stewart and Kneale, 1970; Bithell and Stewart, 1975; Doll and Wakeford, \n1997; Wakeford and Little, 2003). \n \nThe discovery of an unusual excess of childhood leukaemia cases in the village of Seascale in \nthe vicinity of the Sellafield nuclear site in Cumbria, UK, raised concerns that this might have \nbeen caused by fetal or neonatal exposure to IR (reviewed in Beral, Roman and Bobrow, 1993). \nTo identify the cause more precisely, a case-control study of the Seascale \u201ccluster\u201d was carried \nout by Gardner and colleagues (Gardner et al, 1990). They interpreted their findings as \nsuggesting an effect of IR on fathers that may be leukaemogenic for their offspring. They \nproposed that this might occur by IR-induced de novo mutations in sperm during the \npreconceptional period, a mechanism later known as the preconceptional irradiation (PPI) \nhypothesis. The PPI hypothesis suggested a new mechanism of leukaemogenesis in humans, \nand was highly controversial, since there was little evidence from other sources to suggest that \nchildhood leukaemia could be caused by germline mutation. Moreover, the fathers\u2019 radiation \nexposure was considered to be insufficient to cause the mutation rate required for the number of \ncases observed (Evans, 1990; Doll, Evans and Darby, 1994; Wakeford et al, 1994). Additionally, \nthere was no evidence for a germline effect among the children of Japanese atomic bomb \nsurvivors (Kodaira et al, 1995, 2004; Izumi et al, 2003). Since radiation damage is randomly \ndistributed in the genome, levels of PPI causing childhood leukaemia should also cause an \n 3\n increase in other single gene disorders (Doll et al, 1994). Parker et al (2000) reported an \nincreased risk of stillbirth in men from Sellafield exposed to PPI, but this was not confirmed by \nDoyle et al (2000) in a more wide-ranging study of nuclear industry workers.  \n \nSubsequently Dubrova and colleagues demonstrated that PPI could lead to an increased \nmutation rate in a type of tandem repeat DNA locus (TRDL) known in humans as minisatellites. \nDue to the high spontaneous germline mutation rate of some minisatellites (>1,000 x higher than \nmost protein-coding loci), a PPI effect could be detected in a substantially smaller population \nthan required to detect mutations in protein-coding loci (Dubrova et al, 1993; 1997). Studies of \ntwo different populations, one exposed to radiation (~0.5 Gy) from radionuclide contaminated \nland following the Chernobyl accident (Dubrova et al, 1996, 1997, 2002), the other due to \nradiation (>1 Sv) from the fallout of nuclear weapons tests (Dubrova et al, 2002), revealed an \napproximate doubling in germline minisatellite mutation rate due to PPI. These and other data \nsuggest that minisatellite mutation rates may be useful biomarkers of germline genetic effects \ncaused by environmental mutagens such as radiation (Yauk, 2004: Bouffler et al, 2006). Since \nminisatellites do not appear to be the direct target of mutagen-induced DNA damage (Dubrova \net al, 1996, 1997), they may be acting as a marker for some other effect, such as genome \nsensitivity or instability (Niwa, 2003).  \n \nBased on the PPI hypothesis for the aetiology of the Sellafield leukaemia cluster (Gardner et al, \n1990), and the increased germline minisatellite mutation due to PPI, we surmised that a \nproportion of sporadic childhood leukaemias might be associated with an increased germline \nminisatellite mutation rate due to undetected exposures of parental germ cells to mutagens. To \naddress this, we compared germline mutation rates in the hypervariable human minisatellite, \nCEB1 (Vergnaud and Denoeud, 2000) in the families of children with leukaemia (n = 109) and \ncontrol families (n = 64), using a sensitive PCR-based germline mutation assay. \n 4\n  \nMaterials and Methods \nStudy Group \nThe case family series consisted of a cross-sectional series of 110 children with acute leukaemia \ntreated at Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, UK, and both biological parents (n = 218 one \nfamily had monozygotic twins with leukaemia). Following parental consent, blood samples (10 - \n20 ml) were collected between 1990 and 1995. The control family series consisted of buccal \nscrape samples obtained from 64 unaffected children also from the North West of England, and \nblood samples from both control parents (n = 128). All sample collection and analyses were \ncarried out with the approval of the Local Research Ethics Committee.  \n \nGenomic DNA Extraction \nGenomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted from case and control blood samples using a Nucleon \nBACC2 genomic DNA extraction kit (Amersham Biosciences), and from buccal samples using \nthe MasterAmp\u2122 Buccal Swab DNA Extraction Kit (Epicentre Technologies). DNA was \nquantified by fluorimetry on a TBS-380 Mini-Fluorometer (Turner BioSystems, Inc. Sunnyvale, \nCA., USA) using a PicoGreen\u00ae (Molecular Probes) based assay, and working DNA dilutions of \n50 ng\/\u00b5l were prepared.  \n \nCEB1 Primer Sequences and PCR Amplification Conditions \nCEB1 alleles were amplified by PCR using the 3' CEB1 primer P14 (5'-ggatcctctcctgtgcctttcct-3') \nas described by Buard et al (1998). The 5' primer MAR1 (5'-gaattttcagtgagagtcggcc-3') was \ndesigned for this study to avoid single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) flanking the CEB1 \nminisatellite, using the CEB1 sequence (accession no. AF048727) and SNP information kindly \nprovided by Dr Jerome Buard (personal communication). PCRs were performed on an MJ \nResearch DNA Engine (Waltham, MA., USA) in reaction mixtures prepared on ice in 0.2 ml thin-\n 5\n walled tubes consisting of 1 \u00b5l of gDNA (50 ng) and 0.5 \u00b5l (2.5 units) of Platinum Taq DNA \npolymerase High Fidelity (Invitrogen) added to 48.5 \u00b5l of Mg2+-titrated PCR master-mix (see \nbelow). Amplification conditions were: 94\u00b0 C for 1 min. 30 s, 30 cycles at 94\u00b0 C for 15s, 60\u00b0 C for \n30 s, 70\u00b0 C for 10 min., and a final extension step of 70\u00b0 C for 15 min.  \n \nMg2+ titration  \nPCR amplification of CEB1 alleles was found to be highly sensitive to Mg2+ concentration. A \nPCR master-mix (19.4 ml) was prepared with the following final reagent concentrations: 0.5 \u00b5M \neach HPLC-purified CEB1 primer (Eurogentec), 0.7 mM MgSO4 (50 mM MgSO4 with Platinum \nTaq DNA Polymerase), 0.2 mM dNTPs (PCR Nucleotide Mix, Amersham Biosciences) 5% v\/v \nDMSO (Sigma), 0.2 mg\/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA, (ultra pure, non-acetylated; Ambion), \nand 1 x High Fidelity PCR Buffer (50x High Fidelity PCR Buffer with Platinum Taq DNA \nPolymerase HF). The master-mix was kept on ice at 4\u00b0 C while a test PCR on a known gDNA \nsample was performed. Lack of bands or faint bands indicated a requirement for more Mg2+, and \nthis was added in 10 or 20 \u00b5l aliquots resulting in an increase of 0.025-0.05 mM Mg2+. This was \nrepeated until robust bands (see below) were obtained, and the titrated master-mix was stored \nat -20\u00b0 C. \n \nElectrophoresis \nCEB1 alleles amplified in 20 \u00b5l PCR reaction mixtures from family trios (father, mother and child) \nwere loaded onto a 40 cm long 0.7% (w\/v) agarose gel (SeaKem LE Agarose, Cambrex \nBioScience). Gels were run at 2 Volts\/cm in 1xTBE buffer (Crystal Buffers, Severn Biotech) for \napproximately 23 h, until the 400 bp marker from the DNA ladder (1 Kbp Plus DNA Ladder, \nInvitrogen) was about to run off the gel. Few alleles <400 bp were observed, but when present \nwere sized by a shorter gel run. Multiple ladder lanes were included across each gel to enable \nthe image analysis software to calculate the gel retardation factor (Rf value) for any region of the \n 6\n gel, allowing more accurate allele sizing. Gels were stained with SYBR Gold Nucleic Acid Gel \nStain (Molecular Probes) in 1xTBE buffer (pH 8.0), the bands being visualised by UV \ntransillumination on a Gel Doc 2000 instrument (Bio-Rad). The captured gel image in TIFF file \nformat was carefully set up so that it was actual size with an image resolution was 38.4 \npixels\/cm. \n \nIdentification of CEB1 Alleles and Mutations \nAllele typing and mutation detection were performed on the gel image using Phoretix\u2122 1D \nAdvance software (Nonlinear Dynamics). Offspring bands were deemed to be germline \nmutations if no corresponding alleles were detected in either parent, based on the separation of \nrespective peak positions by a given number of base-pairs. Band shifts were measured in base-\npairs (not in millimetres) so that allele sizes could be adjusted for variations in Rf. This was \ncarried out by placing a simulated band on the gel image at a position 1.5 mm (corresponding to \n~8 pixels) from the band of interest, in the direction of the progenitor band in the parent. The \nprogenitor band was taken to be the parental allele closest in size to the mutant band (Dubrova \net al, 1996). If the size of the putative mutant allele was equal to or larger (for an expansion), or \nequal to or smaller (for a deletion), than the simulated band (as measured in bp), it was \nclassified as a mutation. For double mutations, where both inherited parental alleles had \nmutated, each mutant allele was assigned to the parental progenitor allele closest in size. An \nadditional consideration was that the combined size of both mutations (disregarding the direction \nof change) was the smallest value, i.e., the smallest overall change in the size of the alleles was \ndetermined. All mutations detected were verified by repeat analysis, in which gDNA was re-\namplified and run on a second gel. \n \n \n \n 7\n Verification of Parentage \nFor ethical reasons, biological parentage was checked only in families with a suspected germline \nmutation. Parentage was analysed using three microsatellite loci: VWA, TH01 and FGA, chosen \nfrom the FBI CODIS (Combined DNA Index System) short tandem repeat (STR) loci, and one \nminisatellite locus, D1S80, historically used for forensic analysis. Primer sequences were: VWA \n5'-ccctagtggatgataagaataatcagtatg-3' and 5'-ggacagatgataaatacataggatggatgg-3'; TH01 5'-\nattcaaagggtatctgggctctgg-3', 5'-gtgggctgaaaagctcccgattat-3'; and FGA 5'-\nattatccaaaagtcaaatgccccatagg-3', 5'-atcgaaaatatggttattgaagtagctg-3' were obtained from the \nSTR Database (http:\/\/www.cstl.nist.gov\/div831\/strbase\/). Primer sequences for D1S80 were: 5'-\ngtcttgttggagatgcacgtgccccttgc-3', 5'-gaaactggcctccaaacactgcccgccg-3' as described in Kasai et \nal (1990). HPLC purified primers were obtained from Eurogentec or Applied Biosystems, the \nforward primer from each set being fluorescently labelled at the 5'-end: primers for VWA, and \nTH01 were labelled with VIC and NED respectively; FGA and D1S80 were both labelled with 6-\nFAM (amplicons from these loci could be distinguished due to differences in size range of locus \nalleles). All four loci were co-amplified and analysed on an ABI-310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied \nBiosystems). Reagent concentrations in a 20 \u00b5l reaction volume were: 1x ReddyMix\u2122 PCR \nMaster Mix with 2.5 mM MgCl2 (ABgene), 0.25 \u00b5M each primer and 2.5 ng\/\u00b5l DNA. PCR \namplification conditions were: 95\u00b0 C for 2 min, 30 cycles at 95\u00b0 C for 30s, 63\u00b0 C for 30 s, 70\u00b0 C \nfor 2 min., and a final extension step of 70\u00b0 C for 5 min. Non-parentage was scored if one or \nmore of the four loci showed a child to have an allele not present in either parent.  \n \nData Analysis \nCEB1 germline mutation rates were calculated from the frequency of transmitted mutant alleles \nin case and control families, as a fraction or percentage of the total parental alleles detected in \nthe case or control child series. Calculations were performed using the statistical packages \nMinitab (release 13.30), or SPSS (release 11.5.0), and the significance of differences in germline \n 8\n mutation rates between case and control families, and comparisons with published mutation \nrates calculated using Fisher's Exact test, with two-tailed p values. Allele size distributions in \ncase and control parents were compared using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Z two-independent \nsamples test , and mean parental ages compared using the independent-samples T test. \n \nResults \nStudy Group Characteristics \nThe childhood leukaemia family series consisted of 110 patients and 218 parents from 109 \nfamilies, two patients with B cell precursor ALL (BCP ALL) being monozygotic (MZ) twins. The \ncontrol family series consisted of 64 unaffected children and 128 parents. Further studies \nresulted in the exclusion of 9 cases but no controls (see below) leaving 100 case families. Of the \n9 excluded case families, 5 were due to failure to detect the required CEB1 alleles (see \nDiscussion), and 4 were due to non-parentage. The total number of case children in 100 families \nwas 101, but for analysis purposes the MZ twins were treated as one case.  \n \nThe mean age of patients at diagnosis was 5.7 years (range: 0.2 - 15.0 years), and the mean \nage of control children at sample collection was 10.3 years (range: 4.6 - 21.1 years). Table 1 \nshows the number of case children with each leukaemia subtype, and the number of samples \ncollected at diagnosis or remission. Mean paternal ages at the birth of case and control children \nwere similar (cases: 30.1 years, SD = 5.5; controls 31.0 years, SD = 6.3; p = 0.34). Mean \nmaternal ages for case and control children were not significantly different (case mothers: 28.1 \nyears, SD = 5.7; control mothers: 29.1 years, SD = 4.6; p=0.22).  \n \nAmplification of CEB1 alleles \nCEB1 alleles were amplified by PCR to visible levels from case and control family genomic DNA \nand scored in SYBR-gold stained gels. As shown in Figure 1, a precise Mg2+ concentration (to \n 9\n within ~0.1 mM) was found to be necessary for successful amplification and allele discrimination. \nThis was achieved, to an accuracy of 0.025 mM, giving an allele amplification efficiency of 90%, \nby titrating the Mg2+ concentration in the PCR master-mix (see Methods). No amplification \nartefacts were observed, and repeated analysis of the same samples gave consistent results. \nThis method was applied to the total 164 families in the present study, 93% (153) being totally \ninformative with both alleles present in offspring. Mutated alleles could be unambiguously \nassigned to their parental progenitors. In the remaining 11 families (7 case; 4 control) the child \nwas only informative for one CEB1 allele. \n \nCase-Control Mutation Rate Comparison \nWe detected 8 parental germline CEB1 mutations in 100 case children, and 11 mutations in 64 \ncontrol children (1 child having two germline mutations). Figure 2 shows representative \nexamples of 2 case families in which each child carries a mutant allele. All except one of the \ntotal case and control mutations were paternal in origin, the only maternal mutation being in the \ncontrol child with two mutations. As shown in Table 2, the overall parental mutation rate in case \nfamilies is 0.0414 and in control families is 0.0887. The paternal mutation rate in case families is \n0.0825 and in control families it is 0.1613, this difference being statistically non-significant (p > \n0.2). Analysis of mutation rates in relation to leukaemia subtype (Table 3) was limited by the \nsmall number of patients in each group, and the results must be viewed with caution. The \nhighest mutation rate was observed in T ALL (0.1250), but this is based on only 5 cases. We \ncompared the ages of case fathers whose children had a germline mutation with fathers of \nchildren who did not, but found no significant difference (p = 0.28). Similarly we found no \nsignificant difference in the age of control fathers of children with or without germline mutations \n(p = 0.11). Among the germline mutations detected in the 8 case children, 4 were found in gDNA \nfrom remission blood and 4 in diagnostic samples (see Discussion). \n \n 10\n Comparison of CEB1 allele sizes in case and control parents (Figure 3) revealed no significant \ndifference in size distribution between the two groups (P > 0.05). Overall, parental alleles ranged \nin size from 215 bp (5 repeats) to 9,131 bp (228 repeats) with a mean case parent allele size of \n2,896 bp (72 repeats), and a mean control parent allele size of 2,711 bp (68 repeats). \n \nGermline mutation spectrum \nWe compared the type of mutational event (gain or loss of repeats), and the size of the repeat \nfor the case and control germline mutant alleles. In children with leukaemia, we observed 5 \n(62%) mutant alleles with an increase and 3 with a decreased number of repeats, whilst in the \ncontrols, 9 (81%) mutants were increased, and 2 were decreased in size. In both groups the size \nof the mutational events were similar, most mutations (68%) involving the gain or loss of 1 - 5 \nrepeat units (Figure 4). Overall, the largest mutation detected was a deletion of 12 repeat units \n(progenitor allele size: 3,454 bp) in a control child. In the case series the largest mutation was a \ndeletion of 9 repeats (progenitor allele size: 2,634 kbp) in a remission sample from a child with \nBCP ALL.  \n \nDiscussion \nThis study was designed to address the hypothesis that childhood leukaemia is associated with \nan increased rate of germline mutation in the hypervariable minisatellite, CEB1. The results \nsuggest, with some qualifications, that there is no such association. The hypothesis was based \non the on the notion that the exposure of parental germ cells to mutagenic agents such as IR, \ncan lead to an increased risk of childhood leukaemia - the PPI hypothesis (Gardner et al, 1990), \nwith minisatellite mutation acting directly or indirectly as a biomarker of germline leukaemogenic \ndamage. As far as we are aware no previous analysis of this type has been reported in \nchildhood leukaemia. We could find no evidence for quantitative (germline mutation rate) or \n 11\n qualitative (mutation spectrum) differences in CEB1 minisatellite mutations between case and \ncontrol families.  \n \nUnlike other studies of germline minisatellite mutation rate in relation to parental IR exposure \n(reviewed by Bouffler et al, 2006), no radiation dosimetry was available for our leukaemia case \nseries. The catchment area for our sporadic cases covers an area of North West England south \nof Cumbria, where levels of occupational or environmental radiation exposure are far below that \nreached at Sellafield. In view of the high rate of spontaneous and PPI-induced CEB1 mutation, \nwe believe that this provides the most sensitive current measure of germ cell mutagenesis, and \ngiven the absence of any increase in association with childhood leukaemia provides reassuring, \nalbeit preliminary, evidence that childhood leukaemia arises post-zygotically.  \n \nGermline minisatellite mutation analysis has generally been carried out using Southern blotting \nor probing for PCR-amplified gDNA (Dubrova et al, 1996; Stead and Jeffreys, 2000). However, \nthis can be expensive on gDNA and leads to difficulties in testing children where the amount of \nsample is a limiting factor. We therefore selected a PCR-based assay that directly visualised \nCEB1 alleles on long-read agarose gels using a UV transilluminator. We found direct analysis of \nPCR products to be simple, and bands clearly resolvable, allowing fine resolution and sizing of \nmutations. However, most minisatellites are difficult to amplify by PCR due to their high GC-\ncontent, large allele sizes, and large differences in relative allele size, and this limits the number \nof minisatellites that can be analysed by our method. We found that the most critical aspect of \nCEB1 amplification was the Mg2+ concentration. Deviation from the optimum concentration by as \nlittle as 0.1 mM resulted in poor, or no amplification. We overcame this by titrating Mg2+ using a \nlarge volume of PCR master-mix. This gave reproducible amplification of CEB1 alleles to visible \nlevels, and should be useful for the analysis of other PCR-able minisatellite loci, as we have \nfound for the minisatellite B6.7 (Tamaki et al, 1999). \n 12\n  \nThe majority of all germline mutations detected in both series of subjects in the present study \n(18\/19) were paternal in origin, a result previously reported for CEB1 (Vergnaud et al, 1991). In \naddition to comparing germline mutation rates in case and control families, we examined the \nsize change and polarity of mutational events (increase or decrease in allele size), but we found \nno differences between the two series. In both groups, expansions in allele size were more \nprevalent than deletions (with an overall ratio of 3:1 in favour of expansion), and a large \nproportion of mutations involved the gain or loss of only 1 - 3 repeat units (75% cases, 64% \ncontrols). Small mutations such as these are reminiscent of the stepwise model for microsatellite \nexpansion (Nag, 2003) though the evidence suggests that virtually all CEB1 germline mutations \nare initiated by recombinogenic events occurring during gametogenesis (Buard et al, 1998; \nBuard et al, 2000), and not as a result of DNA replication slippage. \n \nIn view of the tendency of some single gene disorders to increase in frequency with paternal \nage, we compared paternal ages at the birth of case and control children with germline \nmutations. We could find no evidence that fathers transmitting germline mutations were \nsignificantly older than those who did not. Mean allele sizes differed slightly between the groups \n(72 and 68 repeats in cases and controls respectively), but no significant overall difference \nbetween the distributions was found (Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-independent samples test), \nsuggesting that differences in allele size distribution is probably not a factor in the risk of \nleukaemia. Analysis of CEB1 mutation rate in relation to leukaemia subtype was limited by the \nsmall number of cases in the study, but our preliminary result suggesting that the mutation rate \nmay be higher in fathers of patients with T ALL deserves further study. As far as we are aware \nthere are no data on the sub-types of leukaemia in the Seascale leukaemia cluster that might \nsuggest a bias toward a specific subtype.  \n \n 13\n A potential confounding problem in our study concerns the type of sample analysed from the \nleukaemia patients. We collected 68% of blood samples at diagnosis and 32% in remission. \nSince the diagnostic samples contained varying percentages of leukaemic blasts (1-96%), there \nwas a possibility that CEB1 somatic mutations could have influenced the result. However, the \nCEB1 somatic mutation rate is known to be very low (Vergnaud et al, 1991; Buard et al, 1998; \n2000), and no increase in somatic minisatellite mutation rate in leukaemic blasts has previously \nbeen reported. A comparison of the mutations in the diagnostic (4 mutations in 68 children; \n5.9%) and remission samples (4 mutations in 32 children; 12.5%) revealed a lower frequency in \nthe former which may account for the lower overall germline mutation rate in the cases than the \ncontrols (0.0414 vs 0.0887). In 7 case families, a paired diagnostic and a remission sample were \navailable for analysis. We found no differences in the CEB1 alleles in the paired samples, even \nthough 3 of the diagnostic samples had >73% blasts and 1 had 12% (% blast values were not \navailable for 3 samples). This suggests that CEB1 somatic mutations make little if any \ncontribution to the mutation rate that we detected in case families, and it is thus unlikely that \nleukaemic blasts obscure a higher constitutional mutation rate in normal leucocytes. \n \nIn summary, our preliminary results find no evidence of an increased rate of CEB1 germline \nminisatellite mutation in the parents of children with leukaemia. However, we have only studied \none minisatellite locus, in contrast to normal practice in PPI studies of using up to 8 loci (Bouffler \net al, 2006). Using CEB1 as a biomarker of germ cell sensitivity to mutagens including PPI, our \ndata suggest that germline mutations affecting genetic stability are unlikely to be a major factor \nin the aetiology of childhood leukaemia. However, these results will need confirmation with more \ncases analysed, using more minisatellite loci, before a final conclusion can be reached, since \nour data do not rule out a role for pre-zygotic mutagenesis in a minority of cases. Furthermore, \nthe recent report by Dickinson and Parker (2002) confirming the findings of Gardner et al (1990) \n 14\n of a statistical association between father's radiation dose at Sellafield and the child's risk of \ndeveloping leukaemia still requires a biological explanation.  \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis project was carried out with funding provided by the Department of Health, U.K. (contract \nRRX81), to Dr GM Taylor.
