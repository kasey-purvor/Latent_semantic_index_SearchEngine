INTRODUCTION\nIt is well known that living tissue, including nerve fibers in animals, is very sensitive to external forcing.1\u20133\nFurthermore, biological signal processing takes place in a fluctuating environment. So it is important, and of\ninterest, to try to understand the statistical properties of stochastic neuronal systems and, in particular, to\ninvestigate the mutually cooperative influence of noise and external driving on the behaviour of the neurons.\nThis is a problem that has been the subject of intensive research, both for single and coupled neuron-like\nelements.4\u201312 One of the most intriguing phenomena, that of stochastic resonance,13\u201315 has been observed in\nthe case of simultaneous action of noise and weak (subthreshold) periodic driving on the system. It has been\ndemonstrated that the response of neurons to the external driving can be optimized in this case by the presence\nof a particular level of noise. It has also been shown that noise can substantially modify the dynamical properties\nof the system even in the absence of external driving, leading to the occurrence of the well-known phenomenon\nof coherence resonance.16\u201319 It can thus be seen, even from this brief description, that noise plays a significant\nrole in optimization of the detection, transmission and encoding of signals in neurons.\nDespite the broad interest of this problem, however, an understanding of the role of fluctuations in nerve\ncells still remains elusive, which is why investigation of the different parameter-dependent characteristics for\nboth single neuron-like elements, and ensembles of them, in the presence of various external perturbations is of\nparticular importance.\nRecently very substantial progress has been made towards the understanding of fluctuation-induced escape\nfrom a metastable state, and of activated processes in general, by using the path-integral concept.20\u201324 In the\npresent paper we attempt to apply this technique for the examination of our numerical results. We examine the\nstochastic FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model in the presence of weak periodic forcing with the aim of shedding\nnew light on the response of neurons to an external signal in the presence of noise. We will investigate the\nmean activation time in a single FHN element (section 3) and two coupled elements (section 4) as functions\nof noise intensity and of the parameters of the external periodic signal. It will be demonstrated that resonant\nactivation25\u201327 occurs in both cases. For coupled units, the influence of the coupling factor on this effect will\nbe illustrated. The mean activation time found in numerical experiments will be compared with the theoretical\nprediction.\nCorrespondence to Andrey V.

MODEL AND METHODS OF INVESTIGATION\nWe consider the following FHN neuron-like model:\nx\u02d9 = F1(x, y) + A sin(\u03c9t) = x\u2212 x3\/3\u2212 y + A sin(\u03c9t)\ny\u02d9 = F2(x, y) + \u03be(t) = \u03b5(x + I) + \u03be(t),\n(1)\nwhere: \u03be(t) is white Gaussian noise with correlation function \u3008\u03be(t)\u03be(t+ \u03c4)\u3009 = D\u03b4(\u03c4); and \u03b5 and I are the system\nparameters (\u03b5 = 0.05 is a small parameter, and I = 1.05). The curve F1(x, y) = 0 has an N -like form, while\nF2(x, y) = 0 is a straight line. In the absence of both external driving and noise there is only one steady state of\nthe system (1) corresponding to the point of intersection A(x0, y0) of the curves F1(x, y) = 0 and F2(x, y) = 0 in\nthe zero-noise limit. It has coordinates x0 = \u2212I, y0 = \u2212I + I3\/3. In this perturbation-free case all trajectories\nof the system (1) will be attracted to A(x0, y0). In our simulations we assumed that the voltage-like variable\nx is subjected to a subthreshold periodic drive of amplitude A and circular frequency \u03c9. Subthreshold driving\nmeans that the external signal alone is not of sufficient amplitude to produce a response from the neuron (i.e.,\nto generate a spike).\nFigure 1. (a) Phase diagram for the system (1). Dashed lines correspond to nullclines of the unperturbed deterministic\ncase: x = \u2212I and y = x\u2212 x3\/3. The deterministic stable ellipse-like curve is shown by the solid closed line. An enlarged\nversion of the phase diagram in the vicinity of the stable state is shown in the inset. (b) An example of a stochastic\ntrajectory of the system (1). The activation time Ti is calculated as the time to the first crossing of the boundary x = 0\nas shown in the figure.\nSubthreshold periodic driving in the absence of noise leads to the establishment of periodic motion in the\nconfiguration space {x, t} whose projection on the plane {x} = {x, y} looks like a limit cycle: see inset of Fig.\n1(a).\n2.1. Numerical simulation\nThe presence of noise leads to the generation of a response in the system. Our numerical simulations are based\non a noise generator producing Gaussian, normally distributed, deviations of zero mean and unit variance, and\nwe use a modified midpoint method28 for the integration of (1). We will focus on one of the characteristic time\nscales, choosing that known as the mean activation time. It is obtained as the average of first passage times\nacross the boundary x = 0:\nT =\n1\nN\nN\u2211\ni=1\nTi, (2)\nwhere Ti is the activation time for i-th realization, Fig. 1(b).\n2.2. Path-integral based technique for obtaining the mean activation time\nIt is known that many statistical characteristics of stochastic motion for the system (1) can be obtained by\nmaking use of the Fokker-Plank equation (FPE)29:\n\u2202t\u03c1(x, t) = \u2212 12D\u2202i\u2202j [Qij\u03c1(x, t)] + \u2202i[Fi(x, t)\u03c1(x, t)], (3)\nwhere: the notation means \u2202t = \u2202\u2202t , \u2202i =\n\u2202\n\u2202xi\n, \u2202i\u2202j = \u2202\n2\n\u2202xi\u2202xj\n; \u03c1(x, t) is the probability density which completely\nspecifies the system dynamics in the presence of noise; Q = (Qij) is the diffusion matrix, whose elements are\nQ22 = 1, Qij = 0 for i \u0004= 2 or j \u0004= 2, in our simulation. Fi are the right-hand deterministic parts of the Langevin\nequations (1): F1 = x\u2212 x3\/3\u2212 y + A sin(\u03c9t), F2 = \u03b5(x + I).\nIn the small-noise limit, the probability density \u03c1(x, t) of the stochastic process x(t) can be written in the\nWKB-like approximate form30, 31:\n\u03c1(x, t) \u223c Z(x, t) exp {\u2212S(x, t)\/D}, (4)\nwhere Z(x, t) is a prefactor, and the action function S(x, t) plays the role of a non-equilibrium potential.32\nSubstituting Eq. (4) into the FPE (3), and expanding in powers of D, allows one to obtain the equations for the\naction and prefactor30, 31, 33\u201335 in the leading and next-to-leading orders of approximation. It follows from this\nexpansion that the function S(x, t) satisfies the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for a classical action of form:\n\u2202tS(x, t) + H(x,\u2207S) = 0, (5)\nwhere H(xi, pi) = 12Q\nijpipj + Fi(x, t)pi is the Hamiltonian function that must be chosen equal to zero to\nprovide a proper description of exponentially slow escape from the metastable state.34 This suggests a classical\nmechanical interpretation of the function S(x, t) and allows one to calculate it as an action integral taken along\nthe trajectories of an auxiliary Hamiltonian system. The corresponding Hamilton\u2019s equations take the form:\nx\u02d9i = Fi(x, t) + Qijpj\np\u02d9i = \u2212pj\u2202iFj . (6)\nThese equations must be solved simultaneously with the equations for the action function and prefactor in the\nform30:\nS\u02d9(x, t) = pix\u02d9i \u2212H = pi[Fi(x, t) + Qijpj], (7)\nZ\u02d9(x, t) = \u2212\n[\n1\n2\nQij\u2202i\u2202jS(x, t) + \u2202iFi(x, t)\n]\nZ(x, t) (8)\nWe note that the equation for the prefactor (8) involves an unknown Hessian matrix (S,ij \u2261 \u2202i\u2202jS). The system\nof equations (6)-(8) must therefore be closed by adding an equation for the time evolution of the Hessian matrix\nitself. The latter can be obtained34 by differentiation of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation with respect to position\nand momentum along the trajectories of (6):\nS\u02d9,ij = \u2212QyyS,iyS,jy \u2212 \u2202\n2H\n\u2202xj\u2202pk\nS,ik \u2212 \u2202\n2H\n\u2202xi\u2202pk\nS,jk \u2212 \u2202i\u2202jH (9)\nFinally, simultaneous integration of the system of coupled ordinary differential equations (6)-(9) allows one to\ncalculate the action function and prefactor, and hence the probability density (4). To obtain the mean first\npassage time (MFPT) let us rewrite the FPE (3) in the following form:\n\u2202t\u03c1(x, t) = \u2212divG, (10)\nwhere\nG = \u2212 12Dgrad(Q \u03c1(x, t))\u2212 F(x, t)\u03c1(x, t) (11)\nis the probability density current. The MFPT of escape from the basin of attraction \u03a9 of a metastable state A\nof the system (1) via the basin boundary \u2202\u03a9 is thus given by the following formula29, 36:\nT =\n\u222b\n\u03a9\n\u03c1(x, t)dx\u222b\n\u2202\u03a9\n(G,n) d(\u2202\u03a9)\n(12)\nwhere n is the vector of the unit outer normal for the basin of attraction \u03a9. Thus, knowing the current values\n(i.e. the probability density) on the boundary \u2202\u03a9 allows us to obtain the mean activation time.\nThe separatrix \u2202\u03a9 is a solution of (1) in the absence of noise, separating the deterministic trajectories that\nare attracted to the right and left-hand stable branches of the slow-motion curve y = x\u2212 x3\/3 (Fig. 2).\n\u22122 0 2\n\u22121\n\u22120.5\n0\n0.5\n1\nx\ny\nFigure 2. Phase portrait of the system (1) in the absence of noise. Dashed lines correspond to the nullclines as explained\nin Fig. 1. The separatrix is shown by the bold solid line. Deterministic trajectories of the system are shown by the solid\nlines with arrows.\nIn what follows we assume that the separatrix does not change in the presence of external driving. This is a\nstrong assumption that will be analyzed in more detail elsewhere.\n2.2.1. Without periodic driving\nLet us now analyze in detail the integral in the denominator of the (12). In what follows this integral will be\ndenoted as J . We note that, in our particular case, the separatrix \u2202\u03a9 is defined by the condition (n,F) = 0.\nTaking this into account, the integral J can be rewritten as:\nJ = 1\n2\n\u222b\n\u2202\u03a9\n[\nD\nZ\n\u2202Z\n\u2202y\n\u2212 py\n]\nexp {\u2212Smod\/D}(n, ey)dl(x) (13)\nwhere ey is a unit vector in the y-direction. The integration in (13) is taken along the separatrix. Smod =\nS \u2212D lnZ is a modified action function.\nIt can be seen from Fig. 3(a) that Smod is a non-monotonic function of position on the separatrix and has\nminimum at x = xmin. The integral J we can calculate numerically over the whole separatrix.35 However, for\ninvestigation of the effect of periodic driving a more detailed analysis is required. Therefore, we evaluate the\nintegral (13) using a steepest descent technique, expanding the modified action function in Taylor series in a\nsmall vicinity of the point xmin:\nJ =\n[\n1\n2\n(\nD\nZ\n\u2202Z\n\u2202y\n\u2212 py\n)\nexp {\u2212Smod\/D}\n\u221a\n2\u03c0D\nS\n\u2032\u2032\nmodxx\n]\nx=xmin\n. (14)\nThe results of these calculations are compared with numerical simulations in Fig. 3(b).\nFigure 3. (a) Action function (dashed line) and modified action function (solid line) as a function of the variable x\n(without periodic driving); (b) The MFPTs found in the numerical simulations (filled dots) are compared with theoretical\npredictions based on Eq. (14) (triangles).\n3. INFLUENCE OF SUBTHRESHOLD DRIVING ON THE MEAN ACTIVATION\nTIME FOR A SINGLE FHN ELEMENT\nIn the presence of noise, the additional subthreshold periodic driving can induce a substantial decrease of the\nmean activation time T , Fig. 4(a). Furthermore, there exists an optimal frequency for which the MFPT takes a\nminimum value, corresponding to the phenomenon of resonant activation.37\nThe results obtained by numerical investigation of resonant activation in our system are summarized in Fig. 4.\nIt can be seen that a change in the amplitude of the external driving has a pronounced effect on the escape rates.\nFig. 4(a) shows a deepening and broadening of the resonance curve as the amplitude A of the drive is increased.\nFigure 4. Numerical calculations of the mean activation time as a function of driving frequency: (a) for different\namplitudes of the external signal with D = 3.5 \u00b7 10\u22125; and (b) for different noise intensities with A = 0.01.\n3.1. Theoretical analysis considering the influence of periodic driving\nPeriodically driven nonlinear oscillators under non-adiabatic conditions in the presence of noise were analyzed by\nDykman and Smelyansky.38 In our present studies we try to adapt their technique to the analysis of the non-\nadiabatic driving of excitable systems. We therefore assume38, 39 that the dominant effect of resonant activation\nis a field-induced variation of the action function. This is of course a simple consequence of the fact that the\neffect of varying the action is exponentially strong. It is also clear that the smaller the noise intensity is, the\nbetter becomes the corresponding approximation function, since the action in the exponent is divided by the\nsmall parameter D. It is also important to bear in mind that the approximation suggested by Dykman et al38, 39\nis valid only in the region of parameters where the change in the action function is linearly proportional to the\nchange in the amplitude of the driving force. Finally, we note that we have adopted in this paper the next-\nto-leading order of the WKB-approximation. The latter requires that the noise-induced changes of the action\nmust be much smaller then the value of action in the zero-noise limit. Having in mind the above restrictions we\nproceed as follows. The Hamilton\u2019s equations of motion of the auxiliary Hamiltonian system for a singled out\nstochastic FHN model (1) take the following form:\u23a7\u23aa\u23aa\u23a8\n\u23aa\u23aa\u23a9\nx\u02d9 = F1 + Qi1pi = x\u2212 x3\/3\u2212 y + A sin(\u03c9t + \u03d50),\ny\u02d9 = F2 + Qj2pj = \u000b(x + I) + py,\np\u02d9x = \u2212(1\u2212 x2)px \u2212 \u000bpy,\np\u02d9y = px.\n(15)\nCorrespondingly, equations (7), (8), and (9) take the form:\u23a7\u23aa\u23a8\n\u23aa\u23a9\nS\u02d9 = [x\u2212 x3\/3\u2212 y + A sin(\u03c9t + \u03d50)]px + [\u000b(x + I) + py]py,\nZ\u02d9 = \u2212[12S,yy + (1\u2212 x2)]Z,\nS\u02d9,ij = \u2212 12S,iyS,jy \u2212 \u2202Fk\u2202xj S,ik \u2212 \u2202Fk\u2202xi S,jk + 2xp2x\u03b4i1\u03b4j1,\n(16)\nwhere i, j, k = x, y.\nTo describe the initial conditions, we linearize34, 40, 41 equations (15) near the stable point A in the absence\nof the driving force to obtain: \u23a7\u23aa\u23aa\u23a8\n\u23aa\u23aa\u23a9\n\u03b4x\u02d9 = (1\u2212 I2)\u03b4x \u2212 \u03b4y,\n\u03b4y\u02d9 = \u000b\u03b4x + py,\np\u02d9x = \u2212(1\u2212 I2)px \u2212 \u000bpy,\np\u02d9y = px.\n(17)\nA generic point on the unstable manifold is written in this case as v(t) = \u03b11vu1 exp\u03bb1t +\u03b12vu2 exp\u03bb2t where \u03b11,2\nare complex coefficients and \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 are two positive eigenvalues corresponding to the unstable eigenvectors\nvu1 and v\nu\n2 . Accordingly, the connection between the momenta and coordinates on the unstable manifold of the\nlinearized system can be written as:(\npx\npy\n)\n=M\n(\nx\ny\n)\n, where M =\n(\nv1px v2px\nv1py v2py\n)(\nv1x v2x\nv1y v2y\n)\u22121\n. (18)\nEquations (18) provide the choice of proper initial conditions for the integration of equations (6)\u2013(9). Indeed,\nin the vicinity of the stable point (x0, y0), the action can be approximated in the form S(x) = 12x\nTMx. The\nmatrixM therefore defines the curvature of the action surface in the vicinity of the stable state and the prefactor\naccording to the approximation (4).\nAn iterative analysis of (16) shows that the variation of action \u03b4S(\u03c9, \u03d50) takes the form:\n\u03b4S(\u03c9, \u03d50) = AW +O(A2), (19)\nwhere \u03b4S(\u03c9, \u03d50) is the correction to the action S|A=0 that was obtained without periodic driving in the limit of\nzero noise intensity; W is the work done by a unit force along the optimal trajectory of the unperturbed system\n(6).\nFor finite noise intensity, we adopt a similar approximation but with the following modifications. The role\nof the most probable escape path is taken by the path that provides a minimum of the modified action at the\nboundary at x = xmin, and the upper limit of integration is not finite but, rather, is defined by the condition\nthat the modified most probable escape path crosses the boundary.\nConsequently, the integral in the denominator of (12) must be averaged over one period of the external\ndriving, and will take the following form:\nJ =\n[\n1\n4\u03c0\n(\nD\nZ\n\u2202Z\n\u2202y\n\u2212 py\n)\nexp {\u2212Smod\/D}\n\u221a\n2\u03c0D\nS\n\u2032\u2032\nmodxx\n]\nx=xmin\n\u222b\nexp {\u2212\u03b4S(\u03c9, \u03d50)\/D}d\u03d50 (20)\nThese theoretical results for the mean activation time are compared with the results of numerical simula-\ntion in Fig. 5. It should be mentioned here that, the smaller the noise intensity D, the bigger becomes the\nFigure 5. Mean activation time as a function of the frequency of the periodic signal. The theoretical results (solid lines)\nare compared with numerical calculations (circles) for D = 2.5 \u00b7 10\u22125 with: (a) A = 0.0075; and (b) A = 0.005.\nrelative decrease of the mean activation time, Fig. 4(b).

INFLUENCE OF SUBTHRESHOLD DRIVING ON THE MEAN ACTIVATION\nTIME FOR TWO COUPLED FHN ELEMENTS\nIn this section we consider co-operative dynamics in a system of two coupled FHN elements:\nx\u02d91 = x1 \u2212 x31\/3\u2212 y1 + A sin(\u03c9t) + p(x2 \u2212 x1),\ny\u02d91 = \u03b5(x1 + I1) + \u03be1(t),\nx\u02d92 = x2 \u2212 x32\/3\u2212 y2 + A sin(\u03c9t) + p(x1 \u2212 x2),\ny\u02d92 = \u03b5(x2 + I2) + \u03be2(t),\n(21)\nwhere Ii are parameters of the partial element; p is the coupling coefficient; \u03be1,2(t) are the independent compo-\nnents of a two-dimensional Gaussian white noise with correlation functions \u3008\u03bei(0)\u03bej(t)\u3009 = D\u03b4ij\u03b4(t). Further, the\ndependence of the mean activation time on the driving frequency was investigated for cases when both elements\nhave identical initial conditions I1 = I2 = 1.05 (Fig. 6(a)), and I1 = I2 = 1.1 (Fig. 6(b)).\nAs we can see from Fig. 6, different tendencies exist here for the influence of coupling strength on the\nmean activation time for periodically and noisily perturbed FHN-elements. The activation of one element for\nsubthreshold driving leads to a decrease of the mean activation time T for the second (non-activated) element.\nBut if both elements are non-activated, and the response to the driving force is small, the mean activation time\nT of each element is increased due to the coupling because, for large coupling strength, fluctuational forcing of\nboth elements must be correlated to procure their synchronized activation. The tendency for decreasing T is\nstronger with weak coupling strength when close to the bifurcation point where I = 1, Fig. 6(a). The tendency\nfor increasing T is stronger for strong coupling or far from bifurcation point, Fig. 6(a,b). It is interesting to\nnote that, while strong coupling hampers activation for all frequencies (Fig. 6(a),(b)), there exists a region in\nparameter space where weak coupling leads to an increased activation rate for certain frequencies of external\nforcing near the resonant frequency and, on the contrary, to an increased mean activation time for frequencies\nof external forcing that are far from resonance (p = 0.1 on Fig. 6(b)).\nFigure 6. Activation time as a function of the frequency of external periodic forcing for various coupling strengths p in\nthe cases of: (a) I = 1.05 for both elements; and (b) I = 1.1 for both elements.\nAcknowledgments\nThe work was supported by the Engineering and Physical Research Council (UK), by INTAS (project N 01-8667),\nand by RFBR (project NN 03-02-17543).\nREFERENCES\n1.
