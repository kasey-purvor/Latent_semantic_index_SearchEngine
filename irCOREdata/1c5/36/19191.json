Subsequently, the\nmeshwork of fibers becomes 'compacted' and the sinu-\nsoids disappear. Pathological arrest of this compaction\nprocess leads to the persistence of ventricular hypertrabec-\nulation, so called spongy myocardium or left ventricular\n(LV) non-compaction (NC).

[2] The childhood\nform of NC was first described in association with other\ncongenital abnormalities, such as cyanotic congenital\nheart disease, coronary artery anomalies and both right\nand LV outflow tract obstruction. [3-5] Furthermore, it\nmay be associated with neuromuscular abnormalities. In\n1990, Chin et al described a group of 8 patients with NC\nwhich was not associated with other congenital cardiac\nabnormalities. [6] Whilst some reports indicate that NC is\na rare condition with a poor prognosis, [3,7,8] others sug-\ngest that it is more common and that its prognosis is better\nthan expected[9]Application of the current diagnostic cri-\nteria may identify a significant pool of patients who are\nasymptomatic. [10] Although NC has generally been\nregarded as a familial cardiomyopathy, [11] a family his-\ntory of cardiomyopathy is not always present in adults\n[7,9] or children [8] with the morphological characteris-\ntics of NC. Given that NC can be present in asymptomatic\nindividuals, Murphy et al have hypothesised that the con-\ndition may have a long pre-clinical phase. [9] Interest-\ningly, there are anecdotal reports of cases of patients with\nphenotypic non-compaction which resolves with stand-\nard heart failure treatment. [12]\nMost studies have employed echocardiography for the\nidentification of NC. [3,7,9] Recently, however, an\nincreasing number of case reports [13-16] and series [11]\nof patients with NC have demonstrated the superiority of\ncardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) over echocar-\ndiography in the assessment of NC. However, tere is only\none report where the CMR findings were confirmed with\ndirect visualisation of the myocardium. [15] We report the\nclinical features and CMR findings of 42 patients who\nwere consecutively identified as having morphological\nfeatures of NC.\nMethods\nPatients\nPatients were studied following referral to a regional CMR\nservice over a 4 year period. The service has a special inter-\nest in heart failure and cardiomyopathy. Information\nregarding presenting symptoms and family history was\nobtained retrospectively from case notes and patient inter-\nviews. All patients underwent a 12-lead ECG and a CMR\nscan, which is regarded as the gold standard investigation\nfor heart failure. [17] Echocardiographic details as well as\nthe reason for referral for the initial transthoracic echocar-\ndiogram were obtained from referring centres. Left ven-\ntricular hypertrophy (LVH) was defined as a left\nventricular wall thickness > 13 mm. Left ventricular systo-\nlic dysfunction (LVSD) was defined as an LVEF \u2264 40%.\nThe control group comprised 22 subjects who were\nreferred for CMR for the exclusion of a variety of abnor-\nmalities, but who were found to have a normal study.\nControls were selected to match the age and sex of the\nsubjects. Transthoracic echocardiograms were obtained\nwith Vivid 5 and Vivid 7 (GE, Slough, UK) machines and\nanalysed with EchoPac (GE, Slough, UK). Left ventricular\nvolumes were measured from the apical 4 chamber view,\nand LV ejection fraction using the modified Simpson's\ntechnique. [18]\nCardiovascular magnetic resonance\nImages were acquired on a 1.5 Tesla (General Electric\nSigna) scanner using a phased array cardiac coil during\nrepeated 8-second breathholds. A short axis stack of LV\nimages was acquired using a steady state in free precession\n(SSFP) sequence (repetition time 3.0 to 3.8 ms; excitation\ntime 1.0 ms; image matrix 224 \u00d7 224; field of view 36\u201342\ncm; flip angle 45\u00b0) in sequential 8 mm slices (2 mm\ninterslice gap) from the atrioventricular ring to apex. Left\nventricular volumes, ejection fraction and mass (myocar-\ndial density = 1.05 g\/cm3) were quantified using manual\nplanimetry of all short-axis SSFP cine images with MASS\nanalysis software (Medis, the Netherlands) The non-com-\npacted myocardium was excluded from the analysis, and\nwas easily distinguished on CMR. The papillary muscles\nwere excluded from the analysis of left ventricular vol-\numes, as were moderator and aberrant bands.\nTo quantify the extent of NC, Jenni et al [2] adopted the\nend-systolic ratio of non-compacted (NC) to compacted\n(C) myocardial thickness in short axis transthoracic\nechocardiographic views. In our experience with CMR,\nhowever, imaging in the vertical long axis (2-chamber)\nview offers a superior spatial resolution, perhaps because\ntrabeculae are aligned transversely to the imaging plane\n(Figure 1a). As Petersen et al [11], we too have found that\nwith CMR, the differentiation between NC and C is maxi-\nmal at end-diastole (Figure 1a).

We have therefore\nused the vertical long axis (2-chamber) end-diastolic view\nfor the quantification of NC. Apical segments were also\nincluded in the assessment of NC, as these were the most\nfrequently involved. [11] Selected cine loops were\nexported into a dedicated image analysis software package\n(Osirix, freeware from http:\/\/www.osirix-viewer.com\/).\nAfter calibration, the following indices of NC were\nderived: a) NC area, as the area in cm2 of non-compacted\nmyocardium on the two-chamber long axis LV view. This\nis calculated using planimetry of the area delimited by the\npeaks of the trabeculation and the troughs of the recesses.\n(Figure 2a); and b) The x:y ratio at the apex, as described\nby Chin et al [6], which refers to the ratio of distance\nbetween epicardial surface and trough of the recesses (x)\nto the distance between the epicardial surface and the\npeak of the trabeculations (y) (Figure 2b). All patients\nincluded in this study had an x:y ratio \u2265 0.5.\nStatistical analysis\nContinuous variables are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard\nerror of the mean (SEM). Comparisons between normally\ndistributed continuous variables were made using the\nunpaired Student's t test. Pearson correlation analyses\nwere used for univariate correlations. Standard statistical\nanalyses were performed using Statview (Cary, NC, USA)\nincluding ANOVA for comparison between groups. A two-\ntailed p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically signif-\nicant. The study was approved by Birmingham, North East\nand Solihull Research Ethics Committee.\nResults\nA total of 42 cases of NC were identified over a 4 year\nperiod, during which our CMR Unit undertook 763 stud-\nies directed at the assessment of LV function and\/or myo-\ncardial viability. The CMR scan took place within 2\nmonths of the echocardiogram.\nClinical features\nThe clinical characteristics of the individual patients are\nshown in Table S1 (see additional file 1).

Two patients who presented with dyspnoea had a\nprevious history of pulmonary embolism. One patient\nwho presented with palpitations due to atrial fibrillation\nhad suffered a left brachial artery embolism. Of the 6\npatients who were asymptomatic, 1 patient had a family\nhistory of sudden cardiac death, 1 had a family history of\nsudden cardiac death and dilated cardiomyopathy, 1 had\na family history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, 1 was\nreferred following the finding of left ventricular hypertro-\nphy (LVH) on echocardiography and 2 were suspected as\nhaving NC on echocardiography, having presented fol-\nlowing a screening medical examination.\nCoronary angiography on the 8 patients who presented\nwith chest pain revealed non-obstructive ( < 50% stenoses\nin the three main epicardial coronary arteries) coronary\nheart disease in 1 patient and normal, angiographically\nsmooth coronary arteries in 7 patients.\nECG and echocardiography\nThe 12-lead ECG was abnormal in 34 (81%) patients. A\nLBBB was present in 14 (33%), a RBBB in 2 (5%) and a\ndelta wave (Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome) in 1 (2%)\npatient. Voltage features of LVH were observed in 16\n(38%) and a non-specific intraventricular conduction\ndefect in one patient. Isolated lateral T wave inversion\n(leads V4\u2013V6, I, and aVL) was seen in one patient. Atrial\nfibrillation was observed in 12\/42 (29%), which was\nintermittent in 8 and permanent in 4. One patient with\nWolf-Parkinson-White syndrome presented with a\nsupraventricular tachycardia.\nAt the point of referral for CMR, transthoracic echocardi-\nograms were abnormal in all patients. Features of LVH\nwere observed in 29\/42 (69%) and an LVEF \u2264 40% in 9\/\n42 (21%). The suspicion of NC was raised in 4\/42 (10%)\nechocardiograms.\nCardiovascular magnetic resonance\nPatients who presented with dyspnoea had higher left\nventricular end-diastolic (LVEDV) and systolic (LVESV)\nvolumes (both p < 0.0001) and a lower left ventricular\nejection fraction (LVEF, p < 0.0001) than age-matched\nhealthy controls (see table S2 in additional file 2). Out of\nthe 42 patients with NC, 16 (38%) had a LVEF < 40%.\nPatients who did not present with dyspnoea also had\nhigher LVEDV than healthy controls (p = 0.0469), but dif-\nferences in LVESV and LVEF were not statistically signifi-\ncant.\nAs shown in Figure 3, NC myocardium was most fre-\nquently seen at the apex, followed by the apical septum,\nmid-septum, apical inferior wall, basal septum, mid-infe-\nrior and basal inferior walls. No significant differences\nemerged in the x:y ratio or NC area between patients pre-\nsenting with dyspnoea and those without (see table S2 in\nadditional file 2). In analyses of the whole study group,\nno correlation emerged between NC area and either\nLVEDV or LVESV. In the 21 patients without dyspnoea,\nhowever, NC area correlated positively with LVEDV (r =\nDistribution of non-compacted myocardium according to myocardial segmentsFigure 3\nDistribution of non-compacted myocardium according to myocardial segments.Page 4 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Cardiovascular Disorders 2009, 9:37 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2261\/9\/370.52, p = 0.0184) and LVESV (r = 0.56, p = 0.0095) and\nnegatively with LVEF (r = -0.72, p = 0.0001) (Figure 4).\nDiscussion\nWe have shown that NC is associated with asymptomatic\nLVSD, heart failure dysrrhythmias, thromboembolic\nevents and chest pain. Most patients in this study had\nabnormal ECGs and all had abnormal echocardiograms.\nEven patients who did not present with dyspnoea had\nhigher LVEDVs than controls. It could be argued that these\nassociations of NC are coincidental, as trabeculations are\ncommon even in normal hearts. [19] The fact that these\npatients presented with either symptoms or significant\nabnormalities on ECG, echocardiography and\/or CMR,\nhowever, does suggest that NC contributes to pathogene-\nsis. Anatomical correlation of suspected cases of NC could\nimprove the diagnostic utility of investigations.\nThere is little consensus on the diagnostic criteria of NC.\nWith respect to clinical criteria, Petersen et al have stipu-\nlated that the typical appearances of NC on CMR have to\nbe accompanied by NC in a first degree relative, a neu-\nromuscular disorder or complications, such as systemic\nembolisation or regional wall motion abnormalities. [11]\nImplicit in this approach, however, is the definition of NC\nper se as a distinct familial cardiomyopathy, rather than a\npathological phenomenon that can occur in the absence\nof a family history. In this respect, a family history of car-\ndiomyopathy is not always present in adults [7,9] or chil-\ndren [8] with NC. In the present study, no patient was\nfound to have a family history of NC and only 11% had a\nfamily history of other cardiac conditions, such as dilated\ncardiomyopathy, sudden cardiac death or hypertrophic\ncardiomyopathy. Whilst our findings suggest that NC per\nse is not necessarily familial, they raise the possibility of a\ngenetic link between NC, dilated cardiomyopathy, sud-\nden cardiac death and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\nOther studies have shown that familial NC encompasses\nabnormalities that overlap with those seen in families\nwith dilated cardiomyopathy. [9] Whether or not these\nScattergrams of non-compacted (NC) area against left ventricular end-diastolic (LVEDV) and end-systolic (LVESV) volumes, and l ft ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients with left ventricul r ventricular non-compaction who did not pres nt with dyspnoeaFigure 4\nScattergrams of non-compacted (NC) area against left ventricular end-diastolic (LVEDV) and end-systolic \n(LVESV) volumes, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients with left ventricular ventricular \nnon-compaction who did not present with dyspnoea.Page 5 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Cardiovascular Disorders 2009, 9:37 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2261\/9\/37two conditions are genetically linked or whether they\nshare a common etiology remains unclear.\nThe extent of NC has also been adopted as a diagnostic cri-\nterion for NC. Several authors have stipulated diagnostic\nthresholds for NC using various measures of NC\n[2,6,7,11] Using either the x:y ratio proposed by Chin et\nal [6] or the NC area on the two-chamber view, we have\nfound no difference in the extent of NC between patients\npresenting with dyspnoea and those without. Interest-\ningly, significant clinical problems occurred even in\npatients with mild degrees of NC. An example is patient\n#28, an 18 year old male with a history of multiple\nstrokes, intermittent atrial fibrillation, an ejection fraction\nof 36%, a mild degree of NC and an otherwise structurally\nnormal heart on both echocardiography and CMR.\nIn this study, 38% of patients with NC had a CMR-derived\nLVEF < 40%. These findings are consistent with other\nstudies showing that adult NC is frequently associated\nwith LVSD, with reports ranging from 63% to 82%.\n[3,6,7,9] In the whole study group, no correlation\nemerged between the x:y ratio or the NC area on the two-\nchamber view and LVEF. In patients who did not present\nwith dyspnoea, however, there was an inverse correlation\nbetween NC area and LVEF, suggesting that disruption of\nmyocardial architecture associated with NC [15] contrib-\nutes to LVSD, at least up to the point that the patient\ndevelops dypsnoea.\nSome authors have underlined the tendency to interpret\nthe appearance of NC on transthoracic echocardiography\nas concentric LVH, [20] hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\n[21] or an apical tumor. [22] In this study, NC was sus-\npected in 10% of transthoracic echocardiograms per-\nformed in referring centres. The majority had been\nreported as showing concentric LVH or LVSD. This sup-\nports the finding of other authors [11,20,22] that CMR is\nsuperior to transthoracic echocardiography in detecting\nNC. The relatively low sensitivity of transthoracic echocar-\ndiography for detecting LVNC was not explored in this\nstudy.\nThe high incidence of symptomatic cases presented in this\nseries is consistent with work from other tertiary referral\ncentres. [7,9,23] It is likely that the left ventricular impair-\nment is responsible for a high proportion of the symp-\ntoms. The higher incidence of NC in males compared with\nfemales is difficult to interpret in this retrospective study,\nand is not statistically significant. It may reflect referral\nbias or possibly, a higher prevalence of NC in males.\nAll patients in our series had abnormalities of the resting\nECG, including voltage signs of left ventricular hypertro-\nphy, inverted T waves in the chest leads, ST segment\ndepression, axis deviation and intraventricular conduc-\ntion abnormalities. A left bundle branch block was\nobserved in 33%. In one case, NC was associated with\nWolf-Parkinson White syndrome, which has been\nreported in 15% of the childhood form of NC. [8]\nArrhythmias occur frequently is association with NC. We,\nas others, [3,7] have found an association between NC\nand atrial fibrillation, which was the presenting problem\nin 29% of patients. Although the largest study of NC in\nchildren showed no association with ventricular tachycar-\ndia, [8] other studies of adult NC found ventricular tachy-\ncardia in 20 to 40% patients. [9,6] No association with\nventricular tachycardia was found in the present study,\nalthough screening with Holter monitoring was not\nundertaken.\nThromboembolic events have been reported in 21% to\n38% of patients with NC. [3,6,7] In this study, some\npatients suffered a stroke, pulmonary embolism or a\nperipheral embolism. These events may be attributable to\natrial fibrillation, which was found in 2\/4 of these\npatients. Alternatively, thromboembolic events may be\ndue to thrombus formation within the intertrabecular\nrecesses in NC myocardium. [6]\nChest pain was the presenting symptoms in 19% of\npatients. Angiography revealed non-obstructive coronary\nheart disease in one patient and normal coronary arteries\nin 7 patients. In this respect, reduced coronary blood flow\nreserve [24] and subendocardial perfusion defects [25,26]\nare known to occur in association with NC. These are\nthought to relate to failure of the coronary circulation to\ngrow with the myocardial mass and\/or compression of the\nintramural capillaries by hypertrophied myocardium.\n[25] Severe hyperplasia of the vascular media [15] may\nalso be relevant. The possible link between NC, ischemia\nand chest pain, however, remains unexplored.\nOne of the limitations of this study is that the data pre-\nsented are derived from opportunistic investigations,\nprompted by the clinical presentation and the results of\nother investigations. It is possible, therefore, that the prev-\nalence of dysrhythmias, for example, is higher than that\nobserved in this study. We have not undertaken family\nscreening and we cannot, therefore, discount the presence\nof clinically occult NC in patients' relatives. The echocar-\ndiograms were not systematically re-studied after the CMR\nscan; however, this study suggests that CMR allows greater\ndetection of NC.\nA further limitation of the study is that some of the\npatients included in this study had been referred specifi-\ncally from other centres for CMR. The majority of patients\nwere seen at this centre, where CMR is a routine investiga-Page 6 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Cardiovascular Disorders 2009, 9:37 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2261\/9\/37tion. This study must be regarded as including a very\nselected group of patients, and as such this study may not\nbe generalisable to all patients with NC.\nConclusion\nThis study shows that NC is associated with ECG abnor-\nmalities, dysrrhythmias, thromboembolic events, chest\npain, asymptomatic LVSD and heart failure. Some\npatients have a family history of cardiomyopathy and\/or\nsudden cardiac death. Its diagnosis is most adequately\nmade using CMR, which allows identification as well as\nquantification of NC. Further studies are needed to deter-\nmine whether the changes in myocardial architecture\nassociated with non-familial NC is causally related to\nthrombogenesis, arrhythmogenesis and LVSD.\nAbbreviations\nCMR: cardiovascular magnetic resonance; ECG: electro-\ncardiogram; LVEDV: left ventricular end diastolic volume;\nLVEF: left ventricular ejection fraction; LVESV: left ven-\ntricular end systolic volume; LVH: left ventricular hyper-\ntrophy; LVSD: left ventricular systolic dysfunction; NC:\nnon-compaction.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nZRY wrote the manuscript and organised data analysis.
