Phys.\nMass Dispersions from giant dipole resonances 2\n1. Introduction\nThe time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) approach can be used to determine the\nexpectation values of single-particle observables, such as fragment mass, in nuclear\nreactions and decays but is known to underestimate the fluctuations in these values\n[1]. This is due to the 1-body nature of TDHF and the fact that it neglects 2-body\ncorrelations [2]. This problem has previously been studied by Balian and Ve\u00b4ne\u00b4roni\n[3, 4, 5], who derived a general variational theory for the determination of expectation\nvalues, correlations and fluctuations. They found that, given the state of a system\ndescribed, at the time t0, by the 1-body density matrix, \u03c1 (t0) (a Slater determinant\nsatisfying \u03c12 = \u03c1), the fluctuation, \u2206Q, in a 1-body observable, Q, at some later time\nt1, is given by\n(\u2206QBV )\n2\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\nt1\n= lim\n\u03b5\u21920\n1\n2\u03b52\nTr [\u03c1 (t0)\u2212 \u03c3 (t0, \u03b5)] , (1)\nwhere \u03c3 (t, \u03b5) is a 1-body density matrix related to \u03c1 (t) through the boundary condition\n\u03c3 (t1, \u03b5) = exp (i\u03b5Q) \u03c1 (t1) exp (\u2212i\u03b5Q) , (2)\nand where the time evolution of \u03c1 (t) and \u03c3 (t, \u03b5) is given by the usual TDHF equation.\nThis result is significantly different from the standard TDHF result\n(\u2206QTDHF )\n2\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\nt1\n= Tr [Q\u03c1 (t1)Q (1\u2212 \u03c1 (t1))] , (3)\nin that it depends on the initial time, t0, with the final time, t1, entering only through the\nboundary condition (2). The other key feature of this result is that it contains, through\n(2), the observable Q such that this method is specifically tuned to the determination\nof the fluctuation of the observable of interest.\nA practical implementation of (1) requires that a Hartree-Fock calculation be\nperformed to determine the initial state, \u03c1 (t0). The system is then excited by a suitable\nexternal excitation, and a TDHF calculation performed from t0 \u2192 t1 to determine\n\u03c1 (t1). This is used to obtain \u03c3 (t1, \u03b5) using (2) and a second TDHF calculation is\nthen performed with the TDHF code run backwards, t1 \u2192 t0, to obtain \u03c3 (t0, \u03b5). The\ntransformation (2) and the second TDHF calculation must be repeated for a range of\nvalues of \u03b5 to allow \u2206QBV to be determined by extrapolation to \u03b5\u2192 0.\nThe large number of computations required to evaluate (1) and the complexity of\nthese calculations means that only a handful of calculations have been performed using\nthis method and those calculations which have been performed have used simplified\ninteractions and made use of symmetries (either spherical [6], or axial [7, 8]) to render\nthe problems tractable. However, modern advances in computing power mean that\nthis approach can now be implemented using fully 3-dimensional TDHF codes with full\nSkyrme interactions [9, 10, 11, 12].\nWe consider the mass dispersion in a bounded region of space around a giant\ndipole resonance (GDR) which decays through particle emission and calculate the mass\n(number of nucleons) in the nucleus according to\nN (Rc) =\n\u2211\nm<\u00b2F\n\u222b\ndr\u00af |\u03c6m (r\u00af)|2 \u03b8 (Rc \u2212 |r\u00af|) , (4)\nMass Dispersions from giant dipole resonances 3\nwhere Rc is the cutoff radius used to define the bounded region of space.\nThe nucleus was excited by multiplying the ground state wavefunctions from the\nHF calculation by a dipole boost given by\nBD (x, y, z) = exp (iFC (Axx+ Ayy + Azz)) (5)\nwith\nC =\n\u221a\n5\n4pi\n1\n1 + exp\n(\u221a\nx2 + y2 + z2\n) (6)\nand where, for protons, F = 1\/Z, and for neutrons, F = \u22121\/(A \u2212 Z), where A is the\natomic mass number of the nucleus under investigation and Z is its charge. Ax, Ay and\nAz determine the strength of the boost applied to the nucleus.\nWritten in terms of the single particle wavefunctions (1) becomes [7]\n(\u2206NBV )\n2\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\nt1\n= A\u2212 lim\n\u03b5\u21920\nf (\u03b5)\n\u03b52\n, (7)\nf (\u03b5) =\n\u2211\nm,n<\u00b2F\n\u222b\ndr\u00af |\u3008\u03c8m (t0, r\u00af, \u03b5) |\u03c6n (t0, r\u00af)\u3009|2 .\nThe wavefunctions |\u03c6n (t)\u3009 were obtained from the results of a static Hartree-Fock\ncalculation, whilst the wavefunctions |\u03c8m (t, r\u00af, \u03b5)\u3009 result from the backwards TDHF\ncalculations and are related to the wavefunctions |\u03c6n (t, r\u00af)\u3009 through the boundary\ncondition\n\u03c8 (t1, r\u00af, \u03b5) = exp (i\u03b5\u03b8 (Rc \u2212 |r\u00af|))\u03c6 (t1, r\u00af) . (8)\n2. GDR in 32S\nWe consider first a GDR in 32S calculated using the Skyrme interaction with the SLy6\n[13] parametrisation. All calculations were performed in a cubic model space of size\n32\u00d732\u00d732 fm discretised in steps of 1 fm. The initial HF calculation gave a 32S ground\nstate with a total binding energy of 260.36 MeV (compared with the experimental value\nof 271.78 MeV [14]) and a prolate deformation (\u03b22 = 0.11).\nAt the beginning of the dynamic calculation the ground state wavefunctions were\nboosted in accordance with (5) and with Ax = Ay = Az = 112.5 fm\n\u22121. The simulation\nwas allowed to run from an initial time t0 = 0 fm\/c to t1 = 250 fm\/c in steps of 0.2\nfm\/c. The emitted nucleons were reflected back from the boundary of the box and\nwould, were the simulation allowed to run long enough, re-enter the region occupied by\nthe de-exciting nucleus causing unphysical interactions. An analysis of the density and\nof \u3008N (Rc)\u3009 as a function of time was used to verify that the number of nucleons in the\nnucleus had stabilised well in advance of the time t1 and that the radiated flux had not\nhad enough time to be reflected back and to interact with the nucleus.\nThe problem of flux being reflected back from the boundary can be reduced by\nincreasing the size of the model space or through the use of absorbing boundary\nconditions [15]. However, absorbing boundary conditions cannot be used in this\nMass Dispersions from giant dipole resonances 4\n-3\n-2\n-1\n 0\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 0  50  100  150  200  250\nD\ni p\no l\ne  \nM\no m\ne n\nt ,  \nQ  \n( f m\n)\nTime (fm\/c)\n(a) Qx\nQy\nQz\n 3.5\n 4\n 4.5\n 5\n 5.5\n 6\n 6.5\n 7\n 0  0.2  0.4  0.6  0.8  1\n\u2206 N\n2\n\u03b5\n(b) \u2206N2BV\n\u2206N2TDHF\nLinear Fit\nFigure 1. (a) The dipole moments (Qx, Qy and Qz) plotted as a function of time\nfor a GDR in 32S. The difference between Qx and Qy and Qz is consistent with a\ncalculation using a prolate deformed ground state where x is the long axis. (b) \u2206N2BV\nplotted as a function of \u03b5 and extrapolated back to \u03b5 = 0. The standard TDHF result\n(calculated at t1 and independent of \u03b5) is shown for reference.\ncalculation since the evaluation of (1) requires the calculation to be reversible. Increasing\nthe size of the model space is possible but would increase the time taken by the TDHF\ncalculations which is particularly problematic for this application where the TDHF code\nmust already be run many times during each calculation.\nThe dipole moments, Qx, Qy and Qz, were obtained as a function of time using [11]\nQi =\n(A\u2212 Z)Z\nA\n(\n\u3008xPi \u3009 \u2212 \u3008xNi \u3009\n)\n, (9)\nwhere i = 1,2,3 denotes x, y and z and \u3008xPi \u3009 and \u3008xNi \u3009 are the expectation values for\nposition calculated using the proton and neutron single particle states respectively. This\nis shown in figure 1(a). Due to the prolate deformation of the 32S nucleus, the Qy and\nQz values are identical and differ from the Qx values. The periodicity of Qx, Qy and Qz\nallow the excitation energies for the oscillations along each of the three primary axes\nto be estimated. In this instance we obtain, for Qx, a period of \u2248 71 fm\/c giving an\nexcitation energy Ex \u2248 17.5 MeV and, for Qy and Qz, a period of \u2248 68 fm\/c giving an\nexcitation energy Ey \u2248 Ez \u2248 18.3 MeV.\nThe final state gave \u3008N\u3009 = 26.65 with \u2206N2TDHF = 4.08 using Rc = 8 fm which\nrepresents the emission of \u2248 5 nucleons. Rc was chosen so that the bounded region fully\nenclosed the nucleus but omitted, as much as possible, the extended (or dissipated)\ncomponents of the wavefunctions. We note from [2] that the relative simplicity of the\nobservable N (Rc) means that there is a theoretical upper limit on the mass dispersion\nthat can be obtained using the standard TDHF approach(\n\u2206N2TDHF\n)\nmax\n= \u3008N\u3009\n(\n1\u2212 \u3008N\u3009\nA\n)\n, (10)\nwhich gives, in this instance, (\u2206N2TDHF )max = 4.46. This limit has no physical basis\nand is due only to the assumptions of single particle behaviour inherent in the TDHF\napproach. The transformation (8) was applied and the TDHF code was run in reverse.\nThis process was repeated for \u03b5 values in the range 0.05 \u2264 \u03b5 \u2264 0.95 in steps of 0.05.\nAt the end of each time-reversed calculation the fluctuation, \u2206N2BV (\u03b5), was estimated\nMass Dispersions from giant dipole resonances 5\nusing (7). These values were plotted (see figure 1(b)) and a straight line was fitted to\nthe linear section of the graph and extended back to \u03b5 = 0 to obtain \u2206N2BV = 5.92\nwhich represents a 20% increase in \u2206N using the BV approach compared with the\nstandard TDHF result and exceeds the TDHF upper limit, (\u2206N2TDHF )max. This graph\nis typical of those obtained using this approach and is linear for larger values of \u03b5\nincreasing asymptotically as \u03b5 \u2192 0 due to the 1\/\u03b52 term in (1). Often, as in this case,\nthe curve decreases for intermediate values of \u03b5 where the reduced value of \u03b5 means that\nthe transformation (8) only has a small effect making the numerator in (1) numerically\napproximately zero and dominant over the \u03b52 denominator.\nThis calculation has been repeated for Rc = 8.5 fm and Rc = 9 fm to test the\nstability of this approach. The results showed small changes in the observables consistent\nwith the region of interest enclosing increasing amounts of the tails of the wavefunctions\nhowever the essential behaviour and trends remained unchanged as did the relative\ndifference between the mass dispersions calculated using the TDHF and BV approaches.\n3. GDR in 132Sn\nThese calculations have been repeated for the doubly magic nucleus 132Sn. All the\ncalculations were carried out using the same model space and interaction as the 32S\ncalculation. The HF calculation produced an spherical ground state with a binding\nenergy of 1099.71 MeV (compared with the accepted value of 1102.85 MeV [14]). The\nground state single particle wavefunctions were boosted at the start of the TDHF\ncalculation in accordance with (5) and with Ax = Ay = Az = 600 fm\n\u22121 and the\ncalculation was run from t0 = 0 fm\/c to t1 = 250 fm\/c as in the previous calculation.\nThe dipole moments were plotted as a function of time and are shown in figure 2(a).\nThe graph shows Qx, Qy and Qz to be identical as expected for a spherical nucleus\nand gives the periodicity of the dipole moments as \u2248 88 fm\/c which corresponds to a\nresonance energy of \u2248 14.1 MeV. This is close to the experimentally measured value of\n16.1 (7) MeV [16].\nThe standard THDF calculation gave, at the time t1, \u3008N\u3009 = 121.02 and \u2206N2TDHF =\n8.46 representing the emission of 11 nucleons. From (10) we obtain (\u2206N2TDHF )max =\n10.07. A series of transformations and time-reversed TDHF calculations were carried\nout as previously. The resulting graph, and linear fit, are shown in figure 2(b) which\ngives \u2206N2BV = 13.30 which is significantly larger than (\u2206N\n2\nTDHF )max and represents a\n25% increase in \u2206N compared with the standard TDHF result.\n4. Conclusions\nThe Balian-Ve\u00b4ne\u00b4roni approach has been implemented for the first time using a 3-\ndimensional TDHF code with the full Skyrme interaction. Calculations have been\nperformed for GDRs in 32S and 132Sn and have demonstrated that the BV approach\ndoes produce quantitatively larger results for the fluctuations of 1-body operators.
