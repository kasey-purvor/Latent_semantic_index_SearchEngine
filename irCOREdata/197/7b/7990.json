Repeated analyses of structures under certain or \nuncertain loads are often necessary in various fields of applications. Optimization \ntechniques, model updating, design process, Monte Carlo simulations of structures \nwith uncertain parameters are some examples in which several analyses of slightly \nmodified systems occurs. In order to reduce the computational effort in determining \nboth the static and the dynamic response, various Reanalysis techniques have been \nproposed in literature. In this paper the main static Reanalysis techniques are \nreformulated to perform the Reanalysis of linear structural systems subjected to \nmulti-correlated stationary Gaussian stochastic input for both topological and non-\ntopological structural modifications.  \n \nKeywords: Reanalysis, dynamic response, stationary random response. \n \n \n1 Introduction  \n \nRepeated analysis, or \u201cReanalysis\u201d, is needed in various fields of structural \napplications, as design, structural optimization, model updating and structural \ndamage analysis. In these cases, indeed, various modifications that require repetitive \nanalysis of modified systems can occur. The aim of the Reanalysis is the evaluation \nof the structural response (e.g. displacements, forces and stresses) for such changes \nwithout solving the complete set of modified algebraic and\/or differential equations. \nThe solution procedures usually use the results from the analysis of the original \nstructure, called as \u201creference\u201d structure, so reducing the computational effort. The \ninterest in the Reanalysis techniques are increased drastically in last two decades, in \nspite of the significant increase in computer processing power, memory and storage \nspace.  \nReanalysis techniques in stochastic analysis of linear structures \nunder stationary multi-correlated input \n \nby \nP.

S.Agata, 98166, Messina , Italy \n \n \n2 \nDuring design, optimization, model updating and damage analysis processes, \nmechanical and geometrical parameters may change and eventually structural \ncomponents can be added or deleted leading also to a change of the number of the \ndegrees of freedom of the the pertinent finite element model. It follows that the \nReanalysis techniques are classified as \u201ctopological\u201d or \u201cnon-topological\u201d if the \nmodifications lead to a change of the degrees of freedom of the system or not. \nMoreover, the Reanalysis techniques can be used to evaluate the response of \nstructures with linear and non-linear behaviour (see e.g. Kirsch 2008). \nIn the framework of static Reanalysis, recently Akgun et al. (2001) described and \ncompared three methods \u2013 the combined approximations, theorems of structural \nvariations and virtual distorsion method; they show that all the methods stemming \nfrom static Reanalysis are equivalent (for truss structures) to the Sherman-Morrison \n(1949, 1950) and Woodbury (1950) formulas. A review of the main contributions in \nVibration Reanalysis can be found in Kirsch (2008). In this item the main \ncomputational effort is spent in the solution of the eigenproblem, because of exact \nsolution techniques of the problem can be prohibitively expensive or unattainable. \nThe deterministic evaluation of dynamic response in the time domain, usually called \nDynamic Reanalysis, has been performed through  the extension to the dynamics of \nthe Combined Approximations approach (see e.g. Kirsch 2008), the virtual \ndistorsion method (see Kolakowski et al 2008) or by applying the so-called \ndynamics modification method  to the Reanalysis (Muscolino and Cacciola 2004, \nCacciola et al  2005). All the previously quoted methods are able to evaluate \ndynamic responses of either linear or non-linear systems. In the combined \napproximation approach (Kirsch 1996, 2008) global expressions can be achieved by \nconsidering as basis vectors terms of local approximations. In the virtual distorsion \nmethod, virtual forces, modelling modifications of mass distribution, as well as \nvirtual distortions, modelling stiffness modifications of structural elements, are \nintroduced (Kolakowski et al 2008) to modify the reference structure in a fast and \nefficient way. The basic idea of third method is grounded on the assumption that all \nthe dynamic modifications can be viewed as pseudo-forces, according to the so-\ncalled dynamic modification method (Muscolino 1996). The response of the \nmodified structure is retrieved starting from the knowledge of the transition matrix \nand the eigenproperties of the original structure. So that the main difference with the \nclassical Vibration Reanalysis is that the eigenproblem Reanalysis is avoided \ndrastically reducing the computational effort. Therefore, the transient and loading \noperators involved in the step-by-step numerical procedure are determined in \nappropriate form from the knowledge of the original ones related to the unmodified \nstructure. Remarkably, it has been shown that the third approach is also \ncomputationally very effective in determining the random response of multi-degree-\nof-freedom (MDoF) systems with random parameters via a pertinent Monte Carlo \nsimulation (Muscolino and Cacciola 2004). Moreover, via this approach the \nresponse of non-classically damped system is determined without the evaluation of \ncomplex quantities. The latter method has been extended to the Dynamic Reanalysis \nof linear systems subjected to stochastic excitation, modelled as a white noise \nprocesses (Muscolino and Cacciola 2004, Cacciola et al 2003, 2005). \n3 \nIn this paper the Dynamic Reanalysis of linear structural systems, with both \ntopological and non-topological modifications, under multi-correlated stationary \nGaussian non-white excitations is performed. In particular the Kroneker algebra is \nextensively adopted in order to evaluate the first and second order statistical \nmoments of the response, of both original and modified structures, as the solution of \ntwo sets of algebraic equations (Muscolino 1996). The procedure preliminarily \nrequires the projection of the equations governing the evolution of the statistical \nmoments in a reduced space, by means of a coordinate transformation which \nrequires the evaluation of the eigenproperties of original structure only. To this aim \nthe eigenproperties of the original system are suitably exploited so avoiding the \nevaluation of the eigenproperties of the modified system. Therefore, the main \nmethods of static Reanalysis are reformulated in order to evaluate the statistics of the \nmodified structural system, with reduced computational efforts.  \nThe numerical results show the accuracy of the proposed approaches for the \nanalysis of multi-degrees-of-freedom (MDoF) systems. Computational aspects are \nalso addressed. \n \n \n2. Basic equations \n \n2.1.  Deterministic analysis  \nConsider an n-DoF quiescent classically damped structure whose dynamic \nbehaviour is governed by the following equations of motion \n \n( ) ( ) ( ) ( )o o o o o o o o o; (0) ; (0) ,t t t t+ + = = =M u C u K u f u 0 u 0\u0001\u0001 \u0001 \u0001       (1) \n \nwhere oM , oC  and oK  are the mass, damping and stiffness matrices of order n\u00d7n , \nrespectively; ( )o tu  is the 1n\u00d7  vector listing the nodal displacements and o ( )tf  is \nthe 1n\u00d7  load vector of the nodal time-varying applied forces; ( )o 0u  and ( )o 0u\u0001  are \nthe initial conditions and the dot over a variable or a vector defines the time \nderivative. Note that the classically damped system has been chosen for sake of \nconvenience. Indeed assuming the original system as classically damped structure, it \nis possible to uncouple the equations of motion by the following modal coordinate \ntransformation \n \no o o( ) ( ),t t=u q\u03a6                       (2) \n \nwhere o ( )tq  is the 1s\u00d7  ( s n\u2264 ) vector of the generalized coordinates and o\u03a6  is the \nmodal matrix of order n\u00d7 s , solution of the following eigenproblem \n \n2\no o o o o o o o,       ,\nT\ns= =K M M I\u03a6 \u03a6 \u2126 \u03a6 \u03a6                (3) \n \n4 \nin which o\u2126  is the diagonal matrix listing the first s  natural circular frequencies \no, j\u03c9  of the original or \u201creference\u201d structure and sI  is the identity matrix of order \ns\u00d7 s . The uncoupled equations of motion, in the reduced modal space, can be \nwritten as \n \n( )2o o o o o o o o o( ) ( ) ( ) ;      (0) ,   (0) ,Tt t t t+ + = = =q q q f q 0 q 0\u0001\u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u039e \u2126 \u03a6           (4) \n \nwhere o\u039e  is the diagonal generalized damping matrix whose j-th elements is \no, o,2 j j\u03b6 \u03c9 , with o, j\u03b6  the damping ratio of the j-th mode. In order to evaluate the \nresponse, Equation (4) can be conveniently rewritten introducing the 2 1s \u00d7  vector of \nthe reduced modal state variables o ( )tz   \n \no o o o o o( ) ( ) ( ); (0) ,t t t= + =z D z V f z 0\u0001                (5) \n \nbeing \no\no o o2 T\no o o o\n( )( ) ; ; .( )\nstt\nt\n\uf8ee \uf8f9 \uf8ee \uf8f9 \uf8ee \uf8f9\n= = =\uf8ef \uf8fa \uf8ef \uf8fa \uf8ef \uf8fa\n\uf8f0 \uf8fb \uf8f0 \uf8fb \uf8f0 \uf8fb\nq 0 I 0\nz D V\nq\u0001 \u2212\u2126 \u2212\u039e \u03a6\n              (6) \n \nOnce the modal response in the state variable has been evaluated, the nodal state \nvector response can be obtained by the following relationship \n \no\no o o o\no\n( )( ) ( );   ( ) ,( )\nt\nt t t\nt\n\uf8ee \uf8f9\n= = \uf8ef \uf8fa\n\uf8f0 \uf8fb\nu\ny z y\nu\u0001\n\u03a0                (7) \n \nwhere the matrix o\u03a0  of order 2 2n s\u00d7  is given by \n \no\no\no\n.\n\uf8ee \uf8f9\n= \uf8ef \uf8fa\n\uf8f0 \uf8fb\n0\n0\n\u03a6\n\u03a0\n\u03a6\n                      (8) \n \n \n2.2.  Stochastic analysis  \nLet us consider a linear system subjected to stochastic processes. The external load \nvector o ( )tf  can be modelled as a multi-correlated Gaussian stochastic process fully \ncharacterized by the mean vector, \no\n( )tf\u00b5 , and correlation vector, o o 1 2( , )t tf fr , given \nby \n \no\no o o o\no\no o1 2 1 2 1 2\n( ) E ( ) ;\n( , ) E ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ),\nt t\nt t t t t t\n=\n= \u2297 \u2212 \u2297\nf\nf f f f\nf\nr f f\n\u00b5\n\u00b5 \u00b5\n         (9) \n \n5 \nwhere E \u22c5  denotes the stochastic average and the symbol \u2297  means Kronecker \nproduct (Brewer 1978). The input process o( )tf  can be conveniently split in two \nterms as follows \n \no o o\n( ) ( ) ( )t t t= +f ff X\u0002\u00b5            (10) \n \nIn this equation \no\n( )tf\u00b5  is a deterministic vector, whereas o ( )tfX\u0002  is a zero-mean \nmulti-correlated Gaussian random process, with correlation vector \n( ) ( )\no o o o\no o\n1 2 1 2 1 2( , ) E ( , )t t t t t t\u2297= \u2261f f f f f fX Xr X X r\u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 , accounting for the contribution \ndue to the stochastic excitation. In view of the linearity of the problem under \nconsideration and taking into account Equation (10) the state vector o( )tz  in modal \nspace can expressed as follows \n \no oo\n( ) ( ) ( )t t t= +zz Z\u0002\u00b5            (11) \n \nwhere the first term \noo\n( )=E ( )t tz z\u00b5  represents the deterministic response \nassociated with the mean value load vector \no\n( )tf\u00b5 , whereas ( )o tZ\u0002  is a zero mean \n2s -variate random process, solution of the following differential equations \n \noo o o o o\n( ) ( ) ( ); (0) .t t t= + =fZ D Z V X Z 0\u0001\u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002               (12) \n \nIn many cases of practical interest, the response is adequately characterized by the \nknowledge of the mean value vector \no\n( )tz\u00b5  and of the covariance vector o ( )t \u2261z\u03c3  \no oE ( ) ( )t t\u2297Z Z\u0002 \u0002 .

Dynamics modifications \n \nLet consider now a system obtained changing the geometric and mechanical \nparameters of the original one. Eventually some structural components can be added \nor deleted so that the degrees of freedom of the modified system can be different \nfrom the original ones. The equation of motion of the modified structural system is \nwritten as \n \nm m m m m m m( ) ( ) ( ) ( ).t t t t+ + =M u C u K u f\u0001\u0001 \u0001                                             (24) \n \nNote that the modifications could lead to a modified non-classically damped \nsystem even if the original one is classically damped. Due the structural \nmodifications two main cases can be observed: a) non-topological modifications; b) \ntopological modifications.  \n \n3.1.  Non-topological modifications  \nIn the case of non-topological modification the number of the degrees-of-\nfreedom (DOFs) of the modified structural system are the same that one of the \noriginal system. Accordingly, the matrices mM , mC  and mK , of order n\u00d7n , and \nthe vector of applied force m ( )tf , of order 1n \u00d7 , can be written as follows \n  \nm o n n m o n n m o n n m o n; ; ; ( ) ( ) ( ) ,t t t= + = + = + = +M M M C C C K K K f f f  (25) \n \nwhere the matrices n nM , n nC  and n nK , of order n n\u00d7 , account for the variations, \ninduced by the modifications, with respect to the matrices oM , oC  and oK . It is to \nemphasize that non-topological modifications are very common in studying MDoF \nsystems with uncertain parameters via a pertinent Monte Carlo simulation. It is well \nknown that for this problem the adoption of Monte Carlo simulation is quite \nonerous. In this regard, the main steps involved in a Monte Carlo study require: (i) \nthe simulation a set of random variable modelling, (ii) the deterministic analysis of \nthe response for each set of variables, (iii) the evaluation of the response statistics \nrepeating several times deterministic analysis pertinent to each new simulation. In \nthis context the Reanalysis techniques are a promising strategy in reducing the \ncomputational effort (Muscolino and Cacciola 2004). \n \n \n3.2.  Topological modifications  \nThe modification is called topological if it induces the change of the number of \nDOFs of the original structural system. This generally happens when structural \nelements as well as joints are added or deleted. If the number of the DOFs increases \nthe matrices mM , mC  and mK , of order g g\u00d7  ( g n> ), and the forcing vector \nm ( )tf , of order 1g \u00d7 , can be partitioned in the following form  \n9 \n \no n n n r o n n n r\nT Tm m\nn r r r n r r r\no n n n r o n\nTm m\nn r r r r\n; ;\n( ) ( )\n; ( ) .( )\nt t\nt\nt\n+ +\uf8ee \uf8f9 \uf8ee \uf8f9\n= =\uf8ef \uf8fa \uf8ef \uf8fa\n\uf8f0 \uf8fb \uf8f0 \uf8fb\n+ +\uf8ee \uf8f9 \uf8ee \uf8f9\n= =\uf8ef \uf8fa \uf8ef \uf8fa\n\uf8f0 \uf8fb\uf8f0 \uf8fb\nM M M C C C\nM C\nM M C C\nK K K f f\nK f\nK K f\n                          (26) \n \nwhere n nM , n nC , n nK  and n ( )tf  list the modifications of the structural matrices and \nthe force vector related to the original n-DOFs; while r rM , r rC  r rK , and r ( )tf  are \nthe matrices and the force vector associated with the newly added DOFs; n rM , n rC  \nand n rK  represent the coupling between the original and the newly added r g n= \u2212  \nDOFs.  \nLastly, in addition to a variation of the structural properties of the original \nsystem, some joints can be deleted. It follows that the number of DOFs of the \nmodified structure is lower than that of the original system ( )g < n , implying a \nreduction of the problem dimension. The new matrices and the force vector of the \nmodified system are obtained by cancelling out the rows and columns of their \noriginal counterparts pertinent to the deleted joints and adding the variations \n \nm o nn m o n n m o n n; ;= + = + = +M M M C C C K K K ;  m o n( ) ( ) ( )t t t= +f f f .   (27) \n \nIn the previous relationships, the overline means that the order of the new matrices \nis lower than the order of those related to the original structure; the matrices n nM , \nn nC  and n nK  are the matrices of order g g\u00d7  ( g n< ) which denote further possible \nvariations in the modified matrices of the original system. \n \n \n3.3. Equations of the modified system  \nIn this section the equations of motion of the modified system, in modal subspace, \nwith both non-topological and topological modification are formulated in a unified \nway (Muscolino and Cacciola, 2004; Cacciola et al 2003, 2005). In order to do this, \nthe following coordinate transformation is considered \n \nm m( ) ( )t t=u q\u03a8  ,   (28) \n \nwhere \u03a8  is a transformation matrix of order n\u00d7 s  that satisfy the following \ncondition \n \nm\nT\ns=M I\u03a8 \u03a8   (29) \n \n10 \nRemarkably, for non-topological modifications, the transformation matrix \u03a8  can be \nconveniently obtained starting from the matrix of eigenvectors o\u03a6  as follows \n \n-T\no=\u03a8 \u03a6 \u0393   (30) \n \nwhere \u0393  is a triangular matrix of order n\u00d7n , evaluated by applying the Cholesky \ndecomposition, that is it satisfies the following condition \n \nT\no m o.\nT M\u0393 \u0393 = \u03a6 \u03a6   (31) \n \n In the case in which the system dimension changes, i.e. for topological \nmodifications, then some rows should be cancelled out (if some nodes are deleted) \nor added (if some nodes are annexed) to the matrix o\u03a6  before applying the Gram-\nSchmidt procedure. For the case of DOFs addition, the matrix \u03a8 , of order g\u00d7 s , \ncan be obtained as  \n \no\n-T\nr\n\uf8ee \uf8f9\n= \uf8ef \uf8fa\n\uf8f0 \uf8fb\n\u03a6\n\u03a8 \u0393\n\u03a6\n,                                                          (32) \n \nwhere r, j\u03c6 , generic column of the new matrix r\u03a6  (of order r\u00d7 s ), is given by  (Chen \net al 2000) \n \n( ) ( )12 T 2 Tr, r r o, r r n r o, n r o,j j j j\u03c9 \u03c9\u2212= \u2212 \u2212 \u2212K M K M\u03c6 \u03c6 ;   (j=1,2,\u2026, s),                                (33) \n \nbeing o, j\u03c6  and o,j\u03c9  the generic eigenvector and the natural frequency the of the \noriginal structural system, respectively. In the case of DOFs reduction, the matrix \u03a8  \nis simply obtained deleting the rows of the matrix o\u03a6  according to the number of \nnodes deleted in the modified structures \n     Once the matrix \u03a8  is defined, by applying the coordinate transformation (28) the \ncoupled equations of motion for the modified structural system can be rewritten in \nthe reduced modal space as  \n \nm m m m m m( ) ( ) ( ) ( ),T T Tt t t t+ + =q C q K q f\u0001\u0001 \u0001\u03a8 \u03a8 \u03a8 \u03a8 \u03a8          (34) \n \nwhereas, in the reduced (modal) state space  \n \nm m m m m( ) ( ) ( )t t t= +z D z V f\u0001   (35) \n \nbeing \n \n11 \nm m\nm m\n,      .\ns\nT T T\n\uf8ee \uf8f9 \uf8ee \uf8f9\n= =\uf8ef \uf8fa \uf8ef \uf8fa\n\u2212 \u2212\uf8f0 \uf8fb \uf8f0 \uf8fb\n0 I 0\nD V\nK C\u03a8 \u03a8 \u03a8 \u03a8 \u03a8\n (36) \n \nNote that, in order to numerically evaluate the dynamic response of the modified \nstructural system, the procedure recently proposed by the authors (Muscolino and \nCacciola 2004, Cacciola et al 2003,2005) can be applied. This procedure, according \nto the philosophy of the Reanalysis, requires the following steps: (i) to write the \nsolution in the following form \n \nom\nm o\nom\n( )( ) ( )( ) ( ) ( ),( )( ) ( )\ntt t\nt t t\ntt t\n\u2206\uf8ee \uf8f9\uf8ee \uf8f9 \uf8ee \uf8f9\n= + \u2206\uf8ef \uf8fa\uf8ef \uf8fa \uf8ef \uf8fa\u2206\uf8f0 \uf8fb\uf8f0 \uf8fb \uf8f0 \uf8fb\nqq q\nz = + = z z\nqq q\u0001\u0001 \u0001\n           (37) \n \nwhere ( )tz\u2206  is the increment of the response of the modified structural system in \nthe reduced  (modal) subspace with respect to the original modal subspace; (ii) to \nselect, for  both the original and the modified structural system, the same number of \ngeneralized co-ordinates in the reduced subspaces.  \n \n \n \n4. Reanalysis of the stochastic stationary response \n \nThe most common structural systems of engineering interest are subjected to \nstochastic loads. In this context the Stochastic Mechanics deals with the challenging \nproblem determining the random response of a structural system. Several \napproaches have been proposed in literature to cope with this problem (see e.g. Lin, \n1976; Lutes-Sarkani, 1997). The random response is fully defined, by a probabilistic \npoint of view, if the probability density function or alternatively all the statistical \nmoments of the response are known. In the case in which the system is linear \npossessing deterministic geometry and mechanical parameters, and it is forced by a \nGaussian process, the response is Gaussian too. So that, only the statistical moments \nuntil the second order are needed to fully characterize the stochastic response. In this \nsection the Reanalysis is formulated for the case of stationary input. \n \n4.1   First and second order statistical moments for dynamic \nmodifications \nLet assume now that the linear structural system is modified and that the stochastic \ninput is a stationary Gaussian process.

It follows that by introducing the vector jv  \nof order 2 1s \u00d7  \n \n0\n0\n1\n0\nj\nj th position\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ec \uf8f7=\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\u2212\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ed \uf8f8\nv \u0003                    (45)  \n \npossessing the element in the j-th position equal to one and all the other equal to \nzero, the matrix mD  can be rewritten in the following form \n \n2 2\nm o ,\n1 1\ns s\nT\ni j i j\ni j\nD\n= =\n+ \u2206\u2211\u2211D = D v v                   (46),  \n \nbeing \n,i jD\u2206  the element of the matrix \u2206D  located at the i-th row and  j-th column. \nAccordingly to the recursive SMW formula, it is possible to evaluate in exact form \nthe inverse of matrix  mD  updating recursively the inverse of the  matrix oD . That is \n \n1\n0 o\n1 1 2\n1 ,\n, 1\n;\n; 1,..., 4\n1\nT\nk i j k\nk k i j T\ni j j k i\nD k s\nD\n\u2212\n\u2212 \u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n=\n= \u2212 \u2206 =\n+ \u2206\nE D\nE v v E\nE E\nv E v\n                (47) \n \nWhere k stands for k-th iterations and it is independent of i and j. Obviously the \nprocedure should be applied only to the elements \n,\n0i jD\u2206 \u2260 . Since most of the \n14 \nelements of the matrix \u2206D  are zeros, the number of iterations k are only a few, so \nsaving in the computational effort.  \nAnalogously the covariance vector of the modified system can be obtained updating \nintroducing the vector 2, jv  of order \n24 1s \u00d7  \n \n \n2,\n0\n0\n1\n0\nj\nj th position\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ec \uf8f7=\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\u2212\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ed \uf8f8\nv \u0003                  (48) \n \npossessing the element in the j-th position equal to one and all the other equal to \nzero, the matrix m,2D  can be rewritten in the following form \n \n2 24 4\nm,2 o,2 2, , 2, 2,\n1 1\ns s\nT\ni j i j\ni j\nD\n= =\n+ \u2206\u2211\u2211D = D v v                 (49)\n  \n \nBeing 2, ,i jD\u2206  the element of the matrix 2\u2206D  located at the i-th row and  j-th \ncolumn.

The CA provides very accurate results also for \nstructural systems with large changes in the structural system (Kirsh 2008). In order \nto extend this method to stochastic stationary Reanalysis, the mean value and \ncovariance vectors are herein approximate by two linear combinations of pre-\nselected linearly independent basis vectors, generated as \n15 \n \nm\n2 m\n(1) 1 ( ) 1 ( 1)\no m o\n(1) 1 ( ) 1 ( 1)\no,2 2 o,2 2 2 2\n;      2,3,..., ;\n;      2,3,..., .\ni i\nj j\ni p\nj p\n\u2212 \u2212 \u2212\n\u2212 \u2212 \u2212\n= \u2212 = \u2212 \u2206 =\n= = \u2212 \u2206 =\nf\nZ\nr D V r D Dr\nr D F r D D r\u0002\n\u00b5\n                                  (51) \n \nThen the solution of algebraic Equations (38), mean value and covariance vectors, \ncan be approximate by these bases of independent vectors as \n \n2 2m m\n;     ,z zR x R x\u0004 \u0004\u00b5 \u03c3                       (52) \n  \nwhere 2 and R R  are two matrices of order 2s p\u00d7  and \n2\n24s p\u00d7 , respectively \ndefined as \n \n(1) ( ) (1) ( )\n2 2 2,  ..., ;     ,  ..., ,\ni j\uf8ee \uf8f9 \uf8ee \uf8f9= =\uf8f0 \uf8fb \uf8f0 \uf8fbR r r R r r                                   (53) \n \nThe two vectors 2  and  x x  are of order ( )2p s\u0005  and ( )22 4p s\u0005 , respectively,  \nthat can be evaluated in the reduced subspaces as the solution of two sets of  \nalgebraic equations of reduced order with respect the equations governing the \nproblem \n \nm m\n1 T 1 T\nm 2 2 2;       .\n\u2212 \u2212\n= \u2212 = \u2212f Zx A R V x A R F\u0002\u00b5                      (54) \n \nIn these equations, 2 and A A  are two matrices of order p p\u00d7  and 2 2p p\u00d7 , \nrespectively, given as \n \nT T\nm 2 2 m,2 2;       .= =A R D R A R D R                      (55) \n \n \n \n5  Numerical results  \n \nThe proposed procedure is herein applied to the bridge-like truss structure depicted \nin Figure 1.

Note that the lack of coherency of \nthe ground motion accelerations at the three supports is mainly due to the different \nsoil profile underneath the supports of the truss.  \nAfter defined the seismic action the second order statistical moments have been \ndetermined through the procedure described in section 2.2. Specifically the \nequations governing the motion of the original structure read  \n \n( ) ( ) ( ) ( )o o o o o o o o o o; (0) ; (0) ,gt t t t+ + = \u2212 = =M u C u K u M T u u 0 u 0\u0001\u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0001 \u0001     (66) \n  \nWhere ( )g tu\u0001\u0001  is the vector of order 3 1\u00d7  listing the ground motion accelerations at \nthe supports, while oT  is given by the following relationship \n \n1\no o ,og\n\u2212\n= \u2212T K k  \n \nin which \n,ogk  is the matrix of order 3n\u00d7  taking into account of the forces induced \nin the structures due a unitary displacement of each individual support while the \nother are imposed to be zero. Therefore classical modal analysis retaining the first \n10 modes is applied and the analysis is conducted in the reduced modal state space. \nAccordingly the vector oV  and the stochastic averages ( )o oE ( )t t\u2297fX Z\u0002 \u0002  and \n( )\noo\nE ( )t t\u2297 fZ X\u0002 \u0002  are modified as follows, respectively \n \no T\no o o\n\uf8ee \uf8f9\n= \uf8ef \uf8fa\n\u2212\uf8f0 \uf8fb\n0\nV\nM T\u03a6\n                         (67) \nand \n \n( ) { }\n( ) { }\ng g\ng g\ng\ng\n3 o\n*\no 3\no\no\n( ) Vec ( ) d ;\n( ) Vec ( ) d ,\nE ( )\nE ( )\nt t\nt t\n\u03c9 \u03c9 \u03c9\n\u03c9 \u03c9 \u03c9\n\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\uf8ee \uf8f9= \u2297\uf8f0 \uf8fb\n\uf8ee \uf8f9= \u2297\uf8f0 \uf8fb\n\u2297\n\u2297\n\u222b\n\u222b\nu u\nu u\nX X\nX X\nu\nu\nI H S\nH I S\nX Z\nZ X\n\u0001\u0001 \u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001 \u0001\u0001\n\u0002 \u0002\n\u0002 \u0002\n\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\n\u0002 \u0002\n\u0002 \u0002\n        (68) \n18 \n \nThe nodal mean value and covariance vectors have been then determined applying \nEquations(23).  \nIn Figure 4 are shown three plausible modifications that can be applied to the \noriginal structures. In all the case the modified structure is assumed classically \ndamped. Thus any variation in the stiffness and\/or mass matrix induces a variation in \nthe damping matrix as well. In the first case (Figure 4a) a change in the geometry is \nimposed. Specifically all the upper joints are translated of one meter. As a \nconsequence the mass, stiffness and damping matrices are modified. In this case the \nnumber of the degrees of freedom does not change so to belonging to the class of \nnon-topological modifications. In the second and third case (Figures 4b,c) \ntopological modifications are introduced. In the second case (Figures 4b) some \nelements and joints have been deleted so reducing the number of the degrees of \nfreedom, while in the last case (Figure 4c) some elements and joints have been \nadded so to increase the number of the degrees of freedom. Then the overall scenario \nof possible modifications has been considered in this illustrative example. Second \norder statistics of the modified structural systems have been the determined through \nthe proposed reanalysis techniques and compared with the exact solution determined \nthrough the procedure described in section 2.2 replacing the indexes \u201co\u201d with \u201cm\u201d \nby considering 10 modes. Since the multi-correlated is zero mean process only the \nresponse covariance vectors have to be evaluated. In Table (1-3) are compared the \nvariance of the 5-th and 13-th joint of the truss structures of Figure 4 with the \n\u201cexact\u201d ones.  Remarkably both the procedure provided result in perfect agreement \nwith the exact ones. Interestingly, the CA has been applied by using just 3 base \nvectors (i.e. 2 3p = ) so drastically reducing the computational effort. \n \n \n6  Conclusions  \nThe main purpose of the Reanalysis is determining the structural response of \nmodified systems using the pertinent results from the original structure, so reducing \nthe computational effort.  \nIn this paper a procedure for determining the stationary first and second order \nresponse statistical moment of linear behaving modified systems under multi-\ncorrelated stationary Gaussian processes is proposed. Preliminarily it has been \nshown that by applying extensively the Kroneker algebra the response statistics \nvectors can be evaluated by solving two sets of algebraic equations. The proposed \nprocedure requires the following main steps: (i) projection of the equations \ngoverning the evolution of the statistical moments in a reduced space, for both \noriginal and modified structure, by means of a coordinate transformation which \nrequire the evaluation of the eigenproperties of original structure only; (ii) being the \nequations governing the statistics of the response algebraic ones, the main methods \nof static Reanalysis (Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury formula and combined \napproximation method) are reformulated in order to evaluate the statistics of the \nmodified structural system.  \n19 \nA bridge-like truss structure under non-uniform earthquake excitation has been \nused for testing the proposed procedure. The numerical results have shown that the \naccuracy archived is very high for both methods. Moreover, the computational effort \ncan be drastically reduced, without loss in accuracy, considering only few terms of \nthe combined approximation method. \n \n \nReferences \nAkgun MA, Garcelon JH, Haftka RT (2001).
