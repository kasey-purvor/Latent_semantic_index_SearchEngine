Taking inspiration from art historian Jonathan \nCrary\u2019s genealogies of attention, it situates homeland security visuality in a particular \neconomy of attention or attentiveness to the world. How is it that we come to focus on \nsome elements of our way of life, establish them as normal and designate deviations \nfrom the norm? How does this algorithmic attentiveness break up the visual field, \n\u2018pixelating\u2019 sensory data so that it can be reintegrated to project a picture of a person? \nThe pre-emptive lines of sight emerging in contemporary security practice, like the \nheroine in Richard Flanigan\u2019s novel The Unknown Terrorist, become precisely a \nmeans of visualizing the unknown future. The article concludes with reflections on the \ncreative artistic forms of attention that flourish even where the lines of sight of the \nconsumer, the citizen, the border guard, the traveller, the migrant appears ever more \ndirected and delimited. It is in these more creative modes of attention that we find one \nof the most important resources to contemporary political life \u2013 the capacity to \nquestion the \u2018better picture\u2019, to disrupt what we see as ordinary or out of the ordinary \nand confront the routines of our lives anew.  \n \n \n \n 1\n \nLines of Sight: On the Visualization of Unknown Futures1\n \nWe use this data to focus on behavior, not race and ethnicity. In fact, what it \nallows us to do is move beyond crude profiling based on prejudice, and look at \nconduct and communication and actual behavior as a way of determining who \nwe need to take a closer look at. (US Secretary for Homeland Security Michael \nChertoff 2007, emphasis added). \n\u201cThe thing about raster graphics\u201d, Tariq was saying, \u201cis that you can precisely \nmanipulate an image by altering a single dot at a time [\u2026] What they\u2019d like to \ndo with real people if they could. I work on bitmaps to make better pictures. \nThat\u2019s raster graphics [\u2026].\u201d \nShe remembered what Tariq had said to her \u2013 how it was what they would like \nto do with real people if they could. But Tariq only changed images, dot by dot \n[\u2026] They were doing something far bolder: turning her from a woman into \ncartoons, headlines, opinions, fears, fate. They were morphing her pixel by \npixel into what she wasn\u2019t, the unknown terrorist. (Richard Flanigan, The \nUnknown Terrorist 2006: 76, 260).  \n \nIntroduction: Making better pictures \n \nFollowing the conviction and sentencing of the British \u2018fertilizer bombers\u2019 in May \n2007, the US Secretary for Homeland Security, Michael Chertoff, spoke publicly \nabout the need to create better pictures of unknown terrorists in advance of their \narrival on US shores. In his lecture at Johns Hopkins University, Chertoff placed his \nemphasis on how to decide what to focus on, who to look at, which suspicious \nbehaviour is deserving of attention. The significance of his comments far exceeds the \nspecific context of airline passenger data that he is addressing here,2 embodying a \nnovel and politically significant move in the very visuality of the war on terror. What \ndo these data represent that they can be assumed to so nearly capture a picture of \nsomeone who has not yet been seen, who would not otherwise be recognised? If \n 2\nChertoff is correct and these pixelated people are not seen through racial or other \ncategorises that are prejudicial, then what are the implications of living with a digital \nalter ego that, with the contemporary faith in techno-science, cannot be spurned? \n \nThe short answer is that the individuated items of data that have become the mainstay \nof the homefront of the war on terror appear as the \u2018dots\u2019 that, if only they can be \nsuccessfully joined up, are assumed to reveal a picture of an unknown terrorist. Most \noften derived from the residue of daily life left in the patterns of travel, financial and \nconsumer transactions (Amoore and de Goede 2005; 2008), these abstracted items of \ndata become the nodal points that, when joined in association with other items, are \nassumed to become an indisputable visualization of a person. It is not strictly, then, a \npicture or a snapshot of a person that is taken \u2013 an image from a specific and limited \ntemporal standpoint \u2013 rather, it is a projected line of sight that seeks to capture the \n\u201cunknown unknowns\u201d.3 As in Richard Flanigan\u2019s startlingly observant novel, The \nUnknown Terrorist, just as the contemporary consumer is targeted via simulated or \nprojected images of her dreams and desires, so the citizen who becomes terrorist \nsuspect finds her real self eclipsed by the projected picture of a dangerous and \ndisturbed body, \u201cmorphing pixel by pixel\u201d, \u201cbecoming what she was not\u201d. Like the \nscreened visualizations of migrants and travellers that allow the \u201cborder guard to \nbecome the last and not the first line of defence\u201d, or the London Underground \npedestrian surveillance systems that \u201cmean you don\u2019t have to watch the screen all the \ntime\u201d, how we see, who we see, to what we give our attention, takes on renewed \nsignificance (Department of Homeland Security 2004; New Scientist 2003).  \n \nAs decisions based on human lines of sight are integrated with computer encoded \nvisualizations, authorities begin to claim that the calculated projections of a person \ncould never be racialized or otherwise violent or prejudicial, and are no longer a \nmatter of profiling. In fact, Chertoff\u2019s claims for the data visualizations of an air \npassenger were made in the context of a stark choice he presented between denying \nBritish citizens \u201cof Pakistani origin\u201d the right to visa waiver \u2013 categorizing British \ncitizenship into degrees of risk, singling out those \u201cpotentially dangerous people\u201d to \nwhom \u201cwe should pay greater attention\u201d, \u2013 and the acceptance of a system of data \nmining that already identifies past travel to Pakistan and specific name algorithms, \namong many other associations,  as \u201cdangerous\u201d (Chertoff 2007b). The choice here, \n 3\nof course, is no choice at all, for the algorithmic calculation of who should be looked \nat more closely simply redraws the lines between those with entitlement (to visa, to \ncross a border, to be in a public place without disclosure of purpose) and those \nwithout. In short, the visa waiver effectively already is withdrawn from many British \ncitizens by other means \u2013 via a picture \u201cbased on behaviour not background\u201d \n(Chertoff 2007b).    \n \nThe deployment in the war on terror of ways of life, broadly defined \u2013 conduct, \nbehaviour, social custom, movement across a railway platform or airport terminal \u2013 is, \nin many ways, nothing new or significant. Recall in the aftermath of 9\/11 how the \nroutines of daily life were called up as a source of resilience. \u201cWe were told to shop\u201d, \nsays Susan Willis, \u201cshop to show we are patriotic Americans. Shop to show our \nresilience over death and destruction\u201d (2003: 122). The London bombings on July 7 \nmet with similar celebrations of the \u201cvibrant and resilient city, getting back to normal, \ngoing back to work, getting back on the Tube\u201d. Yet, there is a need to be cautious \nwith the treatment of culture in the practices of homeland security. Culture, Derek \nGregory explains \u201cis never a mere mirror of the world\u201d, we can never simply hold up \nthe looking glass of culture to shed new light on contemporary economy or society. \nRather, \u201cculture involves the production, circulation and legitimation of meanings \nthrough representations, practices and performances that enter fully into the \nconstitution of the world\u201d (2004: 11). In the specific and situated circumstances I am \ninterested in here, culture embodies and advances an economy \u2013 a means of \napportioning, segregating, singling out for our collective attentions. How do ways of \nlife come to be known and recognised as such? How is a \u2018normal\u2019 way of life settled \nout, and how does it identify deviations from norm? What does the call to \nattentiveness to \u2018conduct\u2019 or \u2018behaviour\u2019 ask us to pay attention to? How do we know \nwhat it is that we should pay attention to? As in contemporary profiling of consumers \nin the marketplace \u2013 where the as-yet-unencountered unknown consumer is the holy \ngrail sought via fragments of data on their conduct and behaviour \u2013 so in today\u2019s \nhomeland security practice, the unknown terrorist is rendered knowable through the \nfractured bits and bytes of a way of life. \n \nIn this article, I consider this economy of attention or attentiveness to the world, how \nit is that we come to focus on some elements of our way of life, establish them as \n 4\nnormal and designate deviations from the norm. How does this attentiveness break up \nthe visual field, \u2018pixelating\u2019 sensory data so that it can be reintegrated to build a \npicture of a person? Throughout, I am inspired by the work of art historian Jonathan \nCrary, whose careful and detailed genealogies of attention and its role in human \nsubjectivity have urged us to consider that modern sensory stimuli are not primarily \nabout making a subject see, but about \u201cstrategies of isolation and separation\u201d (1999: \n3). Understood in this way, lines of sight are not only about the vigilant modes of \nvisual culture I have discussed elsewhere (Amoore 2007), but they are also lines that \nsegregate and divide, \u201cdividing practices\u201d that render ways of life economic, make \nthem amenable to management, trading, or exchange.  \n \nI begin by thinking through what it means to \u2018pay attention\u2019 in the context of \ncalculable lines of sight that coalesce commercial and security practices. I then move \nto consider how individuated \u2018dots\u2019 of data become reintegrated into the visualization \nof a person, how it is precisely that the unknown risk comes to be perceived. \nThroughout, I am interested in how this mode of attentiveness targets, how it draws \ndisparate elements of life into close association in order to designate the \u2018norm\u2019 and to \nproject what is abnormal or out of the ordinary. Finally, I conclude by reflecting on \nthe creative forms of attention that flourish even where the attentiveness of the \nconsumer, the citizen, the border guard, the traveller, the migrant appears ever more \ndirected and delimited. It is in these more creative modes of attention that we find one \nof the most important resources to contemporary political life \u2013 the capacity to \nquestion the \u2018better picture\u2019, to disrupt what we see as ordinary or out of the ordinary \nand confront the routines of our lives anew.  \n \n \nBecause culture has an economy: are you paying attention? \n  \nAmong the careful plastic-windowed advertising posters on the London Underground \n\u2013 \u201cregister for Oystercard and get 10% off in London\u2019s museums and galleries\u201d; enter \nan art competition and design a future Tube station; download coupons to your mobile \nphone \u2013 the Metropolitan Police Anti-terrorist hotline posters call us to attention: \u201cif \nyou suspect it, report it\u201d; \u201clook out for unusual or suspicious activity\u201d; \u201cuse all your \nsenses\u201d; \u201cyou are that someone\u201d. In so many ways already part of the prosaic and \n 5\nunnoticed sensory backdrop to the daily commute, the specific call for attention at the \nhomefront of the war on terror asks us to single out, from the cacophony of \nbackground noise in public spaces, that which demands a closer look, that which is \nout of the ordinary. How should we understand this mode of attentiveness? Indeed, is \nit of significance at all? As art historian Jonathan Crary has argued, the significance of \nattention and attentiveness to the world is not merely cultural, not confined in its \nimplications to the histories of visual culture. Rather, modes of attention and \nattentiveness are also acutely material \u2013 central in modern times to the way that ways \nof life, culture and cultural difference are made governable. What we see, how we see, \nwhat is made visible, how visualization occurs \u2013 these are not simply the cultural \ndimensions of a material life, but instead they are the very essence of an economy of \nculture. That is to say, practices of attention themselves embody an economy \u2013 a \nmeans of representing and acting on the world such that it can be apportioned, \nsegregated, annexed, exchanged or interchanged. As Crary writes on attentiveness, it \nis \u201cnot primarily concerned with looking at images but rather with the construction of \nconditions that individuate, immobilize, and separate subjects, even within a world in \nwhich mobility and circulation are ubiquitous\u201d (1999: 74). In this sense, practices of \nattention are one specific means of instituting the dividing practices at the heart of \ncontemporary techniques of government.4  \n \nAs the contemporary global economy has sought to incorporate practices of attention, \nperception and affective judgement ever mode closely into circuits of production and \nconsumption \u2013 promoting touch-button \u2018interactivity\u2019, placing the screen in the palm \nof the hand, engaging playfully with the consumer \u2013 so, at the same time the state\u2019s \nsecurity practices have sought to mobilize culture broadly defined \u2013 ways of life, \nlooking out for the out of the ordinary, sifting the patterns of life left in transit or \nconsumer transactions, providing hotlines for people\u2019s reported unease or suspicion. \nThus, London Metropolitan police\u2019s \u2018if you suspect it\u2019 campaigns offer the transaction \nreceipt as one fragment of a picture of a person that could be built; the mobile phone \nimages and video clips from the 2005 London bombings are translated from \u201ccareless \ncinema\u201d into the data-driven analysis of actionable intelligence (Sinclair 2005); the \nflotsam residue of our travel bookings on global reservations databases are extradited \nto the US authorities.5 Across these apparently disparate domains there is a resonance \nin ever more finite targeting of behaviours, conduct, the actions and inferred \n 6\nintentions of people. Someone as yet unknown is apparently identified and made \nvisible, literally \u2018brought to attention\u2019, singled out and immobilized while all around \nhim moves on.     \n \nThough the emergence of novel forms of attentiveness stretches across a spectrum of \npractices \u2013 from appeals to citizen \u2018readiness\u2019 and states of alert (Isin 2004; Hay and \nAndrejevic 2006), to the algorithmic calculations made on the screens of counter-\nterror \u2018hotlines\u2019, and the vast screening of prosaic daily transactions for the ever-\nattentive \u2018watch list\u2019 \u2013 there are a number of points of resonance that enter all of these \ndifferent modes of attention. \n \nContemporary forms of attentiveness are predominantly screened ways of perceiving \nand attending to the world. The interface of the screen \u2013 whether windscreen, mobile \nphone or PDA screen, computer screen, or security \u2018pre-screening\u2019 \u2013 has become an \nimportant site where sovereign decisions (who belongs to the nation, who is \ndangerous to \u2018us\u2019, what the \u2018other\u2019 looks like) are made. \u201cThe screen\u201d, writes Kaja \nSilverman, \u201cis the site at which social and historical difference enters the field of \nvision\u201d (1996: 135). It is not only that the screen becomes the mode of visual \ncommunication of difference, though of course this is important. Instead, the screen \nitself enters into the constitution and performance of difference. So, when the British \ngovernment rejects the US move to deny visas to Britons of Pakistani \u2018origin\u2019, but \naccepts instead \u201cscreening at their end, sharing intelligence with the Americans\u201d and \n\u201cdeporting Britons who failed screening once they arrived at an airport in the US\u201d \n(New York Times 2007), they defer a decision based on racial categories into a \nscreened calculation based on ever more finite classifications of difference. The \ncomputer screen, understood this way, as Anne Friedberg has shown, \u201cis both a \u2018page\u2019 \nand a \u2018window\u2019, at once opaque and transparent\u201d. The flat surface of the screen, the \n\u2018page\u2019 that represents the calculation in this instance, is given depth by the layers and \nleaves of data, the multiple other screens and screenings that may appear transparent \nto the viewer but remain opaque to the person who is displayed there. The surface of \nthe screen has, then \u201ca deep virtual reach to archives and databases, indexed and \naccessible with barely the stroke of a finger\u201d (Friedberg 2006: 19). \n \n 7\nThe screened forms of attention that are dominating contemporary homeland security \npractice function through a process of \u2018screening out\u2019. That is to say, they take large \nquantities of data, multiple sources of stimuli, and they sort and classify that which \nwill appear on the surface. Inside the 34 \u2018surface\u2019 items of airline passenger data in \npassenger name records, for example, are multiple layers of pieces of a persons life, \nintegrated together via pre-screening programmes such as USVISIT, to produce a \npicture of a person\u2019s posed risk to security. It is, of course, only pixelated fragments \nthat enter the visualization, vast quantities of data simultaneously fall out of the \ncalculation, become \u2018background noise\u2019 and are screened out. In many ways this \nfocusing of attention via the annulment of other sensory data is integral to the \nhistories of practices of perception: \n \nWhether it is how we behave in front of the luminous screen of a computer or \nhow we experience a performance in an opera house, how we accomplish \ncertain productive or creative tasks or how we more passively perform routine \nactivities like driving a car or watching television, we are in a dimension of \ncontemporary experience that requires that we effectively cancel out or \nexclude from consciousness much of our immediate environment (Crary 1999: \n1).  \n \nFor Crary, the way that we have come to focus our attention on particular items, tasks \nor people cannot be understood without also acknowledging the processes that cancel \nout or exclude other stimuli. When we attend to one set of sensory data, in order to \nmake it count we necessarily discount other sources. Crary identifies a critical turning \npoint in the mid nineteenth century, when scientific knowledge about how an \nembodied observer sees and perceives the world \u201cdisclosed possible ways that vision \nwas open to procedures of normalization\u201d (1999: 12; see also Crary 1992). It is \nprecisely this normalization within practices of attention that is at work in the \nvisuality of homeland security. When the call is to look for that which is abnormal, \nout of the ordinary, or when the data on an individual is sorted according to patterns \nof normality and deviation, most of the detail behind the data is cancelled out.  \nConduct and behaviour that could, if attended to or seen differently, be an integral \npart of the \u2018norm\u2019, becomes part of the conduct and behaviour designated deviant \nfrom norm and rendered suspicious. Thus, what might be expected to be \u2018normal\u2019 \n 8\npatterns of travel or financial transactions for a British citizen with family in Pakistan \n\u2013 travel to visit relatives, wire transfers of monetary gifts, telephone calls \u2013 will, \nwithin the screened attentiveness to passenger data, be designated suspicious. Like \nRichard Flanagan\u2019s protagonist, \u2018the Doll\u2019 in his novel The Unknown Terrorist, \nwhose careful earnings from lapdancing are hidden in her apartment \u2013 savings to buy \na house, to find the security and prosperity that is promised to the prudent citizen \u2013 \nwhat would be the norm becomes deviant, the cash becomes evidence of \u201ca cell \nfinancing its activities through drug running and the sex industry\u201d (2006: 231).  \n    \n \nIn close association: attending to difference \n \nIn the immediate aftermath of 9\/11, the homeland face of the war on terror identified \nan enemy whose probable future actions were already visible in the traces of life left \nin existing data. Giving evidence at a US Congressional hearing only five months \nafter 9\/11, IBM\u2019s federal business manager testified that \u201cin this war, our enemies are \nhiding in open and available information across a spectrum of databases\u201d (Intelligent \nEnterprise 2002: 8). Technology consultants and IT providers such as IBM have made \nthe generation of probabilistic association rules the forefront of homeland security \npractices. The idea is that locating regularities in large and disparate patterns of data \ncan enable associations to be established between apparently \u2018suspicious\u2019 people, \nplaces, financial transactions, cargo shipments and so on (Ericson 2007). Rules of \nassociation are produced by algorithms \u2013 models or \u201cdecision trees\u201d for a calculation \n(Quinlan 1986). In effect, algorithms precisely function as a means of directing and \ndisciplining attention, focusing on specific points and cancelling out all other data, \nappearing to make it possible to translate probable associations between people or \nobjects into actionable security decisions. In 2003, for example, a US joint inquiry \nconcluded that \u201con September 11, enough relevant data was resident in existing \ndatabases\u201d, so that \u201chad the dots been connected\u201d, the events could have been \n\u201cexposed and stopped\u201d (2003: 14). It is precisely this \u2018connecting of dots\u2019 that is the \nwork of the algorithm. By connecting the dots of probabilistic associations, the \nalgorithm becomes a means of foreseeing or anticipating a course of events yet to take \nplace: \n \n 9\nIf we learned anything from September 11 2001, it is that we need to be better \nat connecting the dots of terrorist-related information. After September 11, we \nused credit card and telephone records to identify those linked with the \nhijackers. But wouldn\u2019t it be better to identify such connections before a \nhijacker boards a plane? \n(US Secretary of Homeland Security, Michael Chertoff 2006). \n \nThe algorithm appears to make possible the conversion of ex post facto evidence in \nthe war on terror into a judgement made in advance of the event. The significant point \nhere is that diverse data points or specified \u2018pixels\u2019 in a digital image are drawn \ntogether in association, producing a recognisable whole. Though the visualized image \nmay bear no resemblance to the actual way of life of the person depicted, this scarcely \nmatters because the digital alter ego becomes the de facto person. As the US Inspector \nGeneral concluded in his survey of government applications of algorithmic \ntechniques, \u201cassociation does not imply a direct causal connection\u201d, but instead it \n\u201cuncovers, interprets and displays relationships between persons, places and events\u201d \n(Department of Homeland Security 2006: 10). It is the specific visualization of threat, \nthen, that marks out the algorithm as a distinctive mode of calculation \u2013 to be \ndisplayed on the screens of border guards, stored on subway travel cards, shared \nbetween multiple public and private agencies. In this sense, the algorithm produces a \nscreened visualization of suspicion, on the basis of which \u2018other\u2019 people are \nintercepted, detained, stopped and searched. \n \nThe origins of algorithmic techniques for visualizing people lie, perhaps not \nsurprisingly, in commercial techniques for imagining the consumer. In the early 1990s \nIBM mathematicians began to work on using bar code data on consumer purchases to \nproject probabilistic judgements about the ways of life of the customer in a given \nscenario (cf. Agrawal et al 1993). The point here was not to be able to predict future \npatterns on the basis of past data, indeed the commercial clients categorically did not \nwant predictability or to capture an already predictable customer. Instead, the dream \nwas to visualize the impulse buyer, the capricious lifestyle of the unknown consumer \nwho might be drawn into the targeting of the marketeers. Though the uncertainties of \nfuture patterns are not treated as strictly knowable, they are seen to be at least \namenable to pre-emptive decision making based on the visualized person. \n 10\n It is precisely this model of pre-emptive visualization of an unknown person that is \nnow running through the logics of homeland security, indeed IBM\u2019s same team is \nnow leading the \u201cmathematical sciences role in homeland security\u201d (BMSA 2004), \nwith IBM prominent contractors on Heathrow airport\u2019s MySense biometrics \nprogramme and on the trials for the UK\u2019s e-borders Semaphore and Iris programmes \n(DHS 2005; Computing 2004: 1). Though programmes of this kind have attracted \nattention for their surveillant nature, with the implications for privacy and civil \nliberties this holds, I want to suggest that they are not primarily surveillant modes of \nseeing. Rather than strictly technologies that \u2018watch\u2019, taking a metaphorical snapshot \nor photograph in a specific spatio-temporal context, these are techniques of \nvisualization. They project an image and they project it forward in time, displaying \ntheir mobility on the ubiquitous screen. As Friedrich Kittler has argued compellingly, \nprojections are produced from fragments of visual data, from individually isolated \ncharacteristics that are then selected, differentiated and reintegrated into a visual \nwhole (1997). Of course, gaps persist between the lines that join the pixilated dots. \nThese gaps, though, are filled with mobile and projected images that produce a \nseamless whole. Describing the illusion of a moving picture that is produced in the \ncinematic process of projecting still frames, Anne Friedberg suggests \u201cfor motion to \nbe reconstituted, its virtual rendition relies on a missing element, a perceptual process \nthat depends on the darkness between the frames\u201d (2006: 92; see also Friedberg \n2002). To state my argument simply here, a visualized image of a person requires \nsome gaps and invisibilities, these are simply filled in by the observer. The projected \nimage, then, is extraordinarily difficult to challenge or expose \u2013 as Richard Flanigan\u2019s \n\u2018Doll\u2019 discovers, when the fragments of her life are reintegrated to project an \nunrecognizable whole, \u201cshe becomes what she is not\u201d. \n \nIt is important at this point to emphasise the ambiguity of practices of attention and \nattentiveness. It is not the case that these are wholly disciplinary practices that act on \nand through us and our lives. As Crary has argued, though industrialization and the \nmarket economy saw \u201cperception function in a way that insures a subject is \nproductive, manageable, and predictable, able to be socially integrated and adaptive\u201d, \nsimultaneously the management of attention reached limits characterised by more \n\u201ccreative states of deep absorption and daydreaming\u201d (1999: 4-5). So, whilst the \n 11\nconduct of commerce and trade required particular attentive habits, it stimulated also \nthe more creative and subjective ways of seeing that flourished in the arts (1999: 52). \n \nArguably, in terms of attentiveness and the visualization of people, something \ninteresting and politically challenging is also happening at the intersection of these \n\u2018productive\u2019 and \u2018creative\u2019 domains of attention. There can be little doubt that \nprojected futures are experienced as both dangers and desires. As media theorist \nJordan Crandall has argued: \n \nBeing-seen is an ontological necessity; we strive to be accounted for within \nthe dominant representational matrices of our time. We are not only talking \nabout a gaze that is intrusive and controlling. We are talking about a gaze that \nprovides the condition for action \u2013 the gaze for which one acts (2005: 20). \n \nConsider, for example, the luxury fashion brand Prada and, specifically, the \narchitectures of their New York flagship store. The glass walled building, stretching \none block and opening up inside with spaces to walk around, see and be seen, the \nstore replaces displays of visible products with technologies that connect the \nconsumer\u2019s sense of identity to future Prada projections of the person. The radio \nfrequency identification (RFID) tags inside the clothing send radio signals to a screen \nin the fitting rooms, triggering images of the clothing as seen on the catwalk. The \nglass walls of the dressing room change in phases from transparent to opaque, and \nlarge video screens \u201creplace mirrors to show your back and side views live\u201d (Kang \nand Cuff 2005: 121). The miniaturized sensor technologies embedded in the clothing \nand in store cards and credit cards provide focal points to be connected together in the \nvisualization of the consumer. As these same RFID technologies are now inserted into \npassports and immigration documents, providing a route of identification into a \nvisualized person, we see both commercial and security drives to become attentive to \nthe element of surprise, the unpredictable or impulsive act.  \n \nIn this sense, algorithmic techniques for making visible mobile people, and indeed \nproducts, goods and money, embody what Samuel Weber calls a \u201ctarget of \nopportunity\u201d, a competitive \u201cseizing\u201d of \u201ctargets that were not foreseen or planned\u201d \n 12\n(2005: 4). The targets of opportunity in the war on terror, then, involve the depiction \nof unknown and mobile enemies: \n \nHowever different the war on terror was going to be from traditional wars, \nwith their relatively well-defined enemies, it would still involve one of the \nbasic mechanisms of traditional hunting and combat, in however modified and \nmodernized a form: namely \u201ctargeting\u201d. The enemy would have to be \nidentified and localized, named and depicted, in order to be made into an \naccessible target\u2026 None of this was, per se, entirely new. What was, however, \nwas the mobility, indeterminate structure, and unpredictability of the spatio-\ntemporal medium in which such targets had to be sited\u2026 In theatres of conflict \nthat had become highly mobile and changeable, \u201ctargets\u201d and \u201copportunity\u201d \nwere linked as never before. \n (Weber 2005: 3-4, emphasis in original). \n \nSamuel Weber\u2019s key point of discussion is the theatre of war, though his argument \nsheds significant light on the modes of attentiveness that I depict here. The \nidentification, localization, naming and depiction of mobile targets is, in this war by \nother means, conducted in and through daily life, in advance of any possible future \nstrike or intervention. The targeting of unknown people is, put simply, becoming a \nmatter of both positioning in the sights (targeting and identifying) and visualizing \nthrough a projected line of sight (pre-empting, making actionable). Just as Prada\u2019s \ncustomers are targeted via electronic tag identifiers and visualized via screened future \nimages of their clothing, so the migrant or traveller is both targeted and anticipated \u2013 \nidentified via their personal data and projected forward so that their digital shadow \narrives at the border before they do. Algorithmic \u2018decision trees\u2019 draw even the most \noverloaded sensory domains into apparent management: the busy and noisy border \ncrossing is stilled on the border guard\u2019s screened list of \u2018selectees\u2019 to single out for \nfurther attention; the crowded subway ticket hall quietly selects anomalous smartcard \ndata and intercepts at the barrier; the RFID data from a football fan\u2019s swipecard \ntransmits an automatic signal to the local police. From the visualization of a person is \nderived the possibility to act on that person. \u201cIdeally, I would like to know\u201d, said \nMichael Chertoff, \u201cdid Mohamed Atta get his ticket paid on the same credit card. That \n 13\nwould be a huge thing. And I really would like to know that in advance, because that \nwould allow us to identify an unknown terrorist\u201d (New York Times 2006b). \n \nIn fact, of course, the algorithmic \u2018decision trees\u2019 do not take decisions at all, they \nmerely defer decision into a calculation that is pre-programmed.6 While they appear \nto visualize a picture of a person that is culturally nuanced \u2013 every minute and prosaic \n\u201cbehaviour\u201d, every aspect of a way of life potentially becoming a part of the \nclassification \u2013 they actually efface difference in their drive for identification. The \nlogic of association rules appears to be peculiarly dependent on culture, yet it is a \nrepresentation of culture that attends too (and makes us attentive to) some aspects of \nsameness and difference, whilst always failing to confront the agonistic difference at \nthe heart of political life (Connolly 1991: 170-171). The claims that visualizations \nused in place of \u2018face-to-face\u2019 pictures avoid racial profiling and other prejudicial \njudgements cannot be upheld. It is always through the visualization of the identity of \nthe \u2018other\u2019 that the sanctity of \u2018we the nation\u2019, \u2018we the people\u2019 is sustained. As \nConnolly puts it, the \u201cself reassurance of identity\u201d is made \u201cthrough the construction \nand otherness\u201d and this otherness is readily adopted as the \u201cdefinition of difference\u201d \n(1991: 9). The algorithmic attentiveness, then, becomes the \u201cmulticultural\u201d7 society\u2019s \ntechnology of choice precisely because it gives the appearance of living alongside \ndifference, of deciding without prejudice \u2013 \u201cwe are interested in behaviour not \nbackground\u201d; \u201cthis is not racial profiling\u201d; \u201cwe prefer screening to visa restrictions\u201d; \n\u201cno more border guards taking decisions based on appearance\u201d \u2013 when in fact it \ncategorizes, isolates and annexes in ways that conceal the violence inside the glossy \nwrapper of techno-science.   \n \nThere is an intensely important political problem here, then. We are faced with a \ntechnique of governing that makes humane, responsible or ethical ways of paying \nattention to the world extraordinarily difficult. Consider, for example, Waverly \nCousin, former police officer and one of the 43 000 \u201cscreeners\u201d employed by the US \nTransportation Security Administration to deploy the \u201cscreening passengers by \nobservation technique\u201d (SPOT) at airports, ports and border crossings. \u201cThe \nobservation of human behaviour is probably the hardest thing to defeat\u201d, explains \nWaverley, \u201cyou just don\u2019t know what I am going to see\u201d (New York Times 2006a). \nWe do not know what he is going to see because the \u2018SPOT\u2019 calculation, while it \n 14\nengages all of the time in the visualization of what Dana Cuff (2003) calls an \u201cobject \nof interest\u201d, is itself always invisible and never an object of interest. Because in \nalgorithmic modes of attention every ordinary everyday act becomes itself a means of \nsettling out the norm and identifying the other that is anomalous, a responsible \ndecision that, in Derrida\u2019s (1994) terms, \u201cadvances where it cannot see\u201d, is \nparticularly elusive. What becomes important politically, I want to suggest in my \nconcluding section, is the capacity precisely to intervene in what we do not know in \nwhat we see, and to mobilize a different form of attentiveness that is perhaps always \nalready co-present.   \n \n \nAttention in a state of distraction: what the artist saw        \n \nI have argued that theories of attention and attentiveness derived from histories of art \nare capable of revealing something significant about the contemporary economy of \nhomeland security culture: that it is not primarily a way of seeing or surveilling the \nworld, but rather a means of dividing, isolating, annexing in order to visualize what is \n\u201cunknown\u201d. Yet, it is not only in concepts from the arts, but also in the practices of \nartistic intervention that we find a potentially valuable ethics and responsibility in \nhow we pay attention to ourselves and other people. An \u201cabsorbed attentiveness\u201d, \nwrites Crary, is not only a \u201cnecessary part of the individual\u2019s functioning within a \nmodern world of economic facts and quantities\u201d, but is always also essential for the \n\u201ccreative exceeding of the limits of individuality\u201d (1999: 53). Because relations of \npower inextricably contain the possibility of resistance, there could never be a fully \nefficient attentive subject whose attention to the world is entirely amenable to \nmanagement. Indeed, as Crary has it, \u201cthe more one investigated, the more attention \nwas shown to contain within itself the condition for its own undoing\u201d (1999: 45-6).  \n \nArt theory and practice is all too readily overlooked as \u201cmerely cultural\u201d by the social \nsciences, accused of \u201csubstituting a trivial form of politics\u201d that focuses on \u201ctransient \nevents, practices and objects\u201d in place of a \u201cserious\u201d political economy of \ntransformation (Butler 1998). I want to suggest here that, even for those who wish to \npursue what they see as \u201cserious\u201d political economies of transformation \u2013 and I \nconsider questions of culture to be among the most serious, \u2013 artistic interventions in \n 15\ntheory and practice are best placed to reflect on many aspects of an emergent \neconomy of culture. The embedding of technologies into everyday objects; the \nvisualization of unknown futures; the screened projection of mobile bodies; the \neconomies of the mundane and the surprising in public space: these are not novel \nideas to many contemporary artists. Indeed, far from focusing on trivial and transient \nevents, innovative artistic practice engages in a deeply historical process of reflection \non perspective, human subjectivity, and cognition. Put simply, the \u201cresonances\u201d \n(Connolly 2005) that so many of our contemporary philosophers, social theorists and \npolitical economists are observing across science, technology, politics and culture, \nhave long been at the heart of leading edge artistic interventions. I will focus here on \nthree areas where I consider artist interventions to open up clear space for questions of \nethical and political responsibility in face of technical depoliticization. \n \nModes of attentiveness in contemporary homeland security practice, as I have argued, \nare particularly dependent on algorithmic logics that designate anomaly on the basis \nof a screening of the norm. The cultural practices of the visual arts precisely invert the \nlogic of \u2018looking out for the out of the ordinary\u2019 \u2013 that which transgresses the norm \u2013 \nin order to identify danger, suggesting instead that the act of being surprised by the \nextraordinary can make us see the norm anew. Even in quite mainstream installations \nof temporary artworks in public spaces, there is an emphasis on surprise as a means of \nseeing daily life differently. In the spaces of the London Underground, for example, \nPlatform for Art has confronted, to a degree, the post 7\/7 fear of the unexpected, \ninviting international artists to install their work on the Piccadilly line stations, \nplatforms and trains. In the Thin Cities project, the artist\u2019s installations were produced \nin \u201cunexpected places on the Tube network\u201d, offering new ways of seeing the daily \ncommute, \u201crevealing new perspectives on London\u201d and \u201cpromoting greater \nunderstanding\u201d (Platform for Art 2006).  \n \nIn this sense, artistic interventions have capacity to call the norm into question, \nreminding us of what we do not pay attention to, creating what Tom Mitchell says \n\u201clooks like a picture of something we could never see\u201d (2005: 260). This is, argues \nCrary, \u201cexperimental activity\u201d that \u201cinvolves the creation of unanticipated spaces and \nenvironments in which our visual and intellectual habits are challenged and disrupted\u201d \n(2003: 7). In contrast to an attentiveness that tries to anticipate on the basis of the \n 16\nfragments that are seen, then, some installation artwork in public space offers us new \nways of attending to the very images we had already screened out as normal. \nAmerican artist Rozalinda Borcila\u2019s Geography Lessons, for example, seeks to \n\u201cintervene in apparently controlled spaces\u201d that are \u201cpoliced through technologies of \nvisualization and information management\u201d (Borcila 2006). Making \u201ccounter \nsurveillance\u201d videos of airport security and urban transport systems (and deported \nfrom the Netherlands when she video recorded Schipol airport\u2019s security), Borcila \nprojects her multiple screen films, rendering extraordinary what has become the \nordinary practice of searching, removing shoes, interrogating, detaining (see figure 1).  \n \nThe question of responsibility in attentive practices of security arises only in terms of \nthe responsibility for vigilance, for paying attention and not becoming distracted. As I \nhave argued, and following Derrida, there is an absence of responsibility in the sense \nthat these forms of attentiveness seek to anticipate, to foresee an unknown future on \nthe basis of an algorithmic calculation. If Derrida is correct, then a responsible \ndecision would have to \u201cadvance where it cannot see\u201d, confronting the difficulty and \nundecidability of all decisions, and recognising that calculation cannot substitute for a \njudgement that may have to be made in the absence of pre-programmed information \n(1992; see also 2001). Artistic interventions, I want to suggest, embody the potential \nto confront the political difficulty of decision and to intervene in ways that are \n\u2018unanticipatory\u2019, advancing where they cannot see. \n \nWhat is particularly interesting about artistic practices that engage with some of the \nemergent technologies of attention, is that they do not seek out a resolution to the \npolitical difficulties posed. Instead, they create a plural space for the articulation of \ndifference, \u201cintegrating technological tools into plural zones of creative activity\u201d and \nproviding ways of imaging the problem outside of narratives of security or \nconsumption (Crary 2003: 9). By way of example, consider New York artist Meghan \nTrainor, whose work integrates RFID tags \u2013 ubiquitous in the visualization of \nconsumers and security \u2018threats\u2019 \u2013 into public installations and performances (see \nfigure 2). The installation \u201clets viewers encounter RFID tags in an application outside \nof its common commercial or surveillance context\u201d, explains Trainor, \u201callowing for \ndifferent reactions to its current and expanding ubiquity in our lives\u201d (Trainor 2004).  \nRather than seek to resolve the paradoxes and contradictions of these technological \n 17\nforms of attentiveness, then, the artworks function \u201cas catalyst\u201d to the exposure of \nparadox and contradiction (De Oliveira 2003). They remind us that within apparently \ndisciplined and securitized modes of attention there are also interstitial spaces of \n\u201cinattention\u201d, \u201cenchantment\u201d or \u201creverie\u201d that may work against prejudicial and \nindividualised practices (Bennett 2001). The background images and data that are \ndiscarded by security practices of visualization are potentially recovered by the \nchanged perspectives of artistic interventions. \n \nFinally, visionary work in artistic practice has, as its raison d\u2019etre, a form of critique \nthat runs \u2018against the grain\u2019 of dominant knowledge about how we pay attention to the \nworld. In Edward Said\u2019s last book before his death, he documents the \u2018late\u2019 work of \nvisionary artists and musicians as not that which has \u201charmony and resolution\u201d, but \nthat which embodies \u201cintransigence, difficulty, and unresolved contradiction\u201d (2006: \n14). In contrast to a line of sight that sees clearly and rationally, then, art against the \ngrain is that which transgresses prevailing modes of thought in order to see the world \ndifferently. Thomas Keenan conjures a comparable alternative \u2018line\u2019 of sight against \nthe grain when he speaks of politics \u201con the bias\u201d, where there is \u201ca withdrawal of the \nrules or the knowledge on which we might rely to take our decisions for us\u201d (1997: \n166). \n \nIn order for responsibility to be reintroduced to the decision, then, it is necessary for \nus to consider this diagonal line of sight that cuts across prevailing ways of attending \nto the world. A final example of such a cut across the grain can be seen in British \nartist Michael Landy\u2019s three year project, Break Down. Situating his work in a disused \ndepartment store on London\u2019s Oxford Street, Landy made an inventory of his life \u2013 \ndismantling, weighing and cataloguing every item that he owned. Simulating the \nbreaking up, classifying and profiling of individuals through their data, Landy \nstripped his pixelated profile down to nothing, publicly displaying the 7000 \ndisassembled objects on a moving production line. Because codified data can be used \nto visualize a person, no matter how absurd or tenuous, the artists who experiment \nwith alternative ways to visualize a person do so against the grain, offering new \nmodes of attention that attend also to the calculation that is made.                                                                \n                                                                                                                                                               \nConclusion: citizenship and unknown futures                                                          \n 18\nIn one reading of the implications of vigilant and anticipatory lines of sight for \ncitizenship, a specific embodiment of the citizen is produced: an attentive, watchful \nand watched citizen whose actions and transactions in daily life are called up to secure \nthe homeland security state. It is perhaps for this reason that so much attention has \nbeen paid in recent times, across the social sciences, to the surveillant practices of an \napparently \u2018post 9\/11 world\u2019. And yet, as Foucault warned in his lectures on the \nemerging security apparatus, the panopticon is \u201ccompletely archaic\u201d, and \u201cthe oldest \ndream of the oldest sovereign\u201d (2007: 66). In contrast to the \u201cexhaustive surveillance \nof individuals\u201d, a \u201cdiscipline\u201d that \u201cconcentrates, focuses and encloses\u201d, Foucault \nobserves an \u201capparatus of security\u201d that \u201copens up\u201d to \u201clet things happen\u201d (2007: 44-\n5). Where disciplinary modes of surveillance produce particular pictures of people, \ndrawn from the \u2018survey\u2019 in the conventional sense of \u2018surveiller\u2019, what I have \ndepicted in this article is a projected picture of a person \u2013 one that preempts, \nvisualizes and anticipates unknown futures. The citizen appears, then, not only as a \nsurveilled picture of a way of life to be verified, checked against criteria and \ndocumentation, authenticated, but also and perhaps more importantly, as a \nvisualization of a potential person who is never quite seen. In terms of material \neffects, the projected people who find themselves on selectee lists for secondary \nchecks, or on no-fly lists, or with their assets frozen, are left confronting a digitized \ndoppelganger whose associations and profile have become more \u2018real\u2019 than even the \nconventions of passport or visa can attain. \n \nThere can be little doubt, at least in my sense of the emerging landscape, that much of \ncontemporary security practice is assembling around a line of sight that conceals \nracialized and prejudicial judgements inside an apparently \u2018expert\u2019 and techno-\nscientific visualization. Indeed, as I have suggested, the processes of screening and \nprojection precisely rely upon the gaps that are \u2018left out\u2019 of association analysis. We \nmight even say that misidentification, so-called \u2018false positives\u2019 and false hits have \nbecome essential parts of the accidents that make citizenship and the denial of \ncitizenship possible (Nyers 2006). For the British citizens \u201cof Pakistani origin\u201d who \nfind themselves projected as as-yet-unknown terrorists, their visualization is achieved \nonly via the constant and consistent screening out of other identity claims they could \nmake. It is for this reason that I find artistic interventions particularly interesting in \nterms of recovering what is screened out, retrieving the lived detail and rendering it \n 19\nvisible. One possible step to take in the political and ethical interventions in security \nvisualizations, I have argued, is to expose the distractions and inattentiveness that \nmake vigilant visualities possible.  \n \nReferences \n \nAgrawal, Rakesh, Tomasz Imielinski and Arun Swami (1993) \u2018Mining Association Rules \nBetween Sets of Items in Large Databases\u2019, SIGMOD Proceedings pp.914-925. \nAmoore, L (2006) \u2018Biometric Borders: Governing Mobilities in the War on Terror,\u2019 Political \nGeography 25: 336-351. \nAmoore, Louise (2007) \u2018Vigilant Visualities: The Watchful Politics of the War on Terror\u2019, \nSecurity Dialogue 38: 2, pp.139-156. \nAmoore, Louise and Marieke de Goede (2005) \u2018Governance, Risk and Dataveillance in the \nWar on Terror\u2019, Crime, Law and Social Change 43: 2, pp.149-173.  \nAmoore, Louise and Marieke de Goede (2008) \u2018Introduction: Governing by Risk in the War \non Terror\u2019, in Louise Amoore and Marieke de Goede (eds) Risk and the War on Terror. \nLondon: Routledge.  \nBennett, Jane (2001) The Enchantment of Modern Life: Attachments, Crossings, Ethics, \nPrinceton NJ: PUP. \nBMSA (2004) The Mathematical Sciences\u2019 Role in the War on Terror, National Academies \nPress. \nBorcila, Rozalinda (2006) \u2018Geography Lessons\u2019, videos available at \nwww.borcila.tk\/geographie\/index.html.

The Passenger Name Record (PNR) agreement \n 22\n                                                                                                                                            \nof 2004 required that airlines submit 34 items of data on each passenger (including , for example, credit \ncard details, past travel data and in-flight meal choices, car hire, hotel bookings and other personal \ninformation) within 15 minutes of flight departure for the US. The PNR data has become central to pre-\nemptive border controls, where risk ratings are assigned to individuals in advance of their arrival at a \nborder (Amoore 2006).  \n3 In a speech to the NATO in 2002, Donald Rumsfeld pondered the importance of taking decisions on \nthe basis of an absence of evidence, of taking into account the \u201cunknown unknowns\u201d:  \n\u201cThe message is that there are no \u2018knowns\u2019. There are things we know that we know. There are \nknown unknowns. That is to say there are things we know that we don\u2019t know. But there are \nalso unknown unknowns. There are things we don\u2019t know we don\u2019t know[...] There is another \nway to phrase that and that is the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence\u201d.   \nHence, the sense that attention is to be paid to that which is not seen, has not been seen, but can \nnonetheless be \u2018projected\u2019.       \n4 In common with others who have sought to push economy \u201cbeyond economism\u201d \u2013 that is, beyond the \neconomy as a pre-discursive, pre-political and self-evident material reality \u2013 economy is used here to \ndenote a field of intervention and a specific means of rendering political life governable (de Goede \n2003; 2005; Miller and Rose 1990). \u201cThe art of government\u201d, writes Foucault, \u201cis essentially \nconcerned with answering the question of how to introduce economy \u2013 that is to say, the correct \nmanner of managing individuals, goods and wealth within the family \u2013 how to introduce this\u2026 into the \nmanagement of the state\u201d (1991: 92). Foucault finds in economy a continuity of the art of governing the \nstate, such that the \u201cvery essence of government\u201d has come to mean \u201cthe art of exercising power in the \nform of economy\u201d (93).  \n    \n5 Reservations databases Amadeus, Galileo and Sabre, used by the major airlines and hotel and other \ntravel groups, are now the conduit for the routine submission of passenger data to the US authorities \nbefore a flight departs for the US. \n6 For Jacques Derrida, a decision is not a decision if it simply redeploys calculative practices in order to \ndecide. A decision cannot, in Derrida\u2019s reading, be determined by the acquisition of knowledge, for \nthen it is not a decision but \u201csimply the application of a body of knowledge of, at the very least, a rule \nor norm\u201d (1994: 37). An apparent decision taken on the basis of what is \u2018seen\u2019 evidentially, via the \ncalculations of experts, or in the screened results of algorithmic visualization, is not a decision at all. \n\u201cThe decision, if there is to be one\u201d, writes Derrida, \u201cmust advance towards a future which is not \nknown, which cannot be anticipated\u201d (1994: 37). \n7 As Slavoj Zizek has it: \u201cmulticulturalism is a disavowed, inverted, self-referential form of racism, a \n\u2018racism with a distance\u2019 \u2013 it respects the Other\u2019s identity, conceiving of the Other as a self-enclosed \n\u2018authentic\u2019 community towards which he, the multiculturalist, maintains a distance rendered possible \nby his privileged universal position\u201d (2006: 171). Thus, the decision based on a visualized calculation \nis precisely a self-referential form of racism, a racism that disavows itself by stripping out its own role \nin identifying the Other that is threatening and dangerous. \n 23\n"}
