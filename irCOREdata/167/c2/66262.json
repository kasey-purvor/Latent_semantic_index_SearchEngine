We add ad-\nditional multiplets transforming as fundamentals and anti-fundamentals under the gauged\nflavour group. Their number is chosen such that the microscopic theory is asymptotically\nfree whereas in the Seiberg dual (w.r.t. the colour group) it changes to an infrared free\ntheory. Non perturbative effects within the flavour group can correct the location of the\nsupersymmetric vacuum. Statements about meta-stability of the susy breaking vacuum\nwould require a two loop calculation. For general couplings, the question whether gauging\nflavour destabilises susy breaking remains open.\n1 Introduction\nThe idea of meta-stable susy breaking [2] has recently been realised in appealingly simple\nmodels [1]. The underlying microscopic theory can be as simple as supersymmetric QCD\nwith a quadratic superpotential. There is a point in the field space of the theory where\na dual macroscopic description is in its perturbative regime and only susy breaking vacua\nexist. The susy breaking scale is a function of a dynamically generated scale and a tree level\nmass. At another point in moduli space the macroscopic theory is strongly coupled at the\nsusy breaking scale. Due to non perturbative corrections a supersymmetric vacuum exists\nat that point. The tunnelling from the susy breaking to the susy preserving vacuum is,\nhowever, highly suppressed and the mechanism is stable enough for all practical purposes.\nThe authors of [1] indicate that they would like to use their mechanism for direct mediation\nof susy breaking.\nIn principle, one could also try to use it for breaking susy in a hidden sector and\nmediate the breaking to the visible sector by one of the known mechanisms. Indeed, such\nconstructions have been put forward in [3]. In the present note, we investigate as a toy\nmodel for this possibility a simple modification of [1], where the flavour group is gauged.\nIn order to avoid strong gauge couplings at the susy breaking point in field space we have\nto add some colour singlets transforming non trivially under flavour. In the non super\nsymmetric vacuum there are fields which remain massless after one loop corrections.\nThe moduli space of supersymmetric vacua within this theory is not completely un-\nderstood. With a certain amount of fine tuning on the flavour coupling we can keep non\nperturbative corrections due to gauged flavour small at the susy breaking scale and com-\npute first order corrections of such effects to the location of the supersymmetric vacuum.\nThe first order correction can move the supersymmetric vacuum towards the non super-\nsymmetric one. Our calculation is only valid if these corrections are small. This is indeed\nthe case and hence the calculation is self consistent.\nIn the next section we review the model [1]. In section three we gauge the flavour\nsymmetry and add colour singlets transforming as fundamentals and anti-fundamentals\nunder the flavour group. We complete the electric-magnetic dictionary for this case. In\nsection four we discuss meta-stable susy breaking for the modified model. There are mass\nsquareds which could become negative at a two loop level. We compute corrections to\nthe location of the supersymmetric vacuum due to non perturbative effects in the gauged\nflavour sector, in an approximation where these corrections are necessarily small. Finally,\nwe provide some concluding remarks. In spirit, the discussed model is similar to [4] where\ngauged flavour has been considered in the context of quiver theories.\n2 The ISS model\nSeveral models for meta-stable supersymmetry breaking have recently been presented in [1],\nand subsequently in [3\u201311]. Here, the focus will be on the first model in [1] which we briefly\nreview in the following. The model has two dual descriptions: One, the microscopic model,\n2\nis appropriate for calculations in the ultraviolet region, since it is asymptotically free, and\nhas no further non renormalisable couplings. The dual description, or the macroscopic\nmodel, is infrared free, and hence the adequate choice for investigating phenomena at\nlower energy. In the macroscopic model, supersymmetry breaking occurs at lower energies,\nwhere the perturbative description is reliable.\nThe microscopic model is an SU(Nc) gauge theory with Nf fundamentals, combined\ninto an Nf \u00d7Nc matrix Q, and anti-fundamentals, written into an Nc\u00d7Nf matrix Q\u02dc, with\nNc + 1 \u2264 Nf < 3\n2\nNc. (1)\nThere is a tree level potential1\nW = mTr\n(\nQQ\u02dc\n)\n(2)\nbreaking the global SU(Nf)\u00d7 SU(Nf ) flavour symmetry to its diagonal subgroup.\nThe Seiberg dual [12] (for reviews see e.g. [13\u201315]) of this theory has gauge group\nSU(N) with\nN = Nf \u2212Nc, (3)\nNf quarks \u03d5, Nf anti-quarks \u03d5\u02dc and singlets \u03a6 transforming as an adjoint plus singlet under\nthe diagonal flavour. The superpotential is\nW = hTr (\u03d5\u02dc\u03a6\u03d5)\u2212 h\u00b52Tr\u03a6. (4)\nThe dictionary for the couplings and parameters reads [1]\n\u039b\u02c6Nf = \u039b\n3Nc\u2212Nf\nc \u039b\u02dc\n3N\u2212Nf\nc (\u22121)N , (5)\n\u03d5 = q, \u03d5\u02dc = q\u02dc, h =\n\u221a\n\u03b1\u039bc\n\u039b\u02c6\n, \u00b52 = \u2212m\u039b\u02c6, (6)\n\u03a6 =\nQQ\u02dc\u221a\n\u03b1\u039bc\n, (7)\nwhere \u039bc and \u039b\u02dcc are the scales at which the colour couplings of the microscopic and\nmacroscopic theory diverge, respectively. The scale \u039b\u02c6 is an additional scale appearing in\nthe dual theory. Q, Q\u02dc are related to q, q\u02dc by Hodge duality on the baryons as in [13]. The\nfactor in (7) appears due to a rescaling giving \u03a6 mass dimension one and removing an\norder one factor \u03b1 from the Ka\u00a8hler potential [1]. This will be of some importance in the\nnext section.\nThe major observation of [1] is the existence of a meta-stable non supersymmetric\nvacuum in the perturbative regime of the macroscopic model,\n\u03a6 = 0 , \u03d5T = \u03d5\u02dc =\n(\n1N , 0Nf\u2212N\n)\n. (8)\n1We do not introduce a general mass matrix breaking this symmetry completely, since later we want\nto consider a model where the unbroken diagonal subgroup is gauged.\n3\nIn this vacuum, some fields have tree level masses of the order |h\u00b5|. In particular TrN\u03a6\nis classically massive, where the index N indicates that the trace is taken over the first N\ndiagonal entries. Other fields, the pseudo moduli, become massive at one loop of pertur-\nbation theory. The Goldstone bosons of broken global symmetries remain massless.\nIn the supersymmetric vacuum, all matter fields are massive and \u03a6 has the expectation\nvalue\n\u03a6 =\n\u039b\u02dcc\nh\n(\n\u00b5\n\u039b\u02dcc\n) 2N\nNf\u2212N\n1Nf . (9)\nTranslated to the microscopic theory, this corresponds to\nQQ\u02dc = m2\n(\n\u039bc\nm\n) 3Nc\u2212Nf\nNc\n1Nf . (10)\nAt the supersymmetry breaking vacuum this VEV is zero. So, if the quark masses are well\nbelow the strong coupling scale of the microscopic theory, the susy breaking vacuum and\nthe supersymmetric vacuum are well separated. This way, the tunnelling probability to\nthe supersymmetric vacuum can be suppressed parametrically.\n3 Dualising Colour with Gauged Flavour Watching\nWe modify the microscopic model of the previous section by gauging the diagonal flavour\ngroup SU(Nf ) and add colour singlets transforming under the fundamental and anti-\nfundamental representation of SU(Nf ). We add k of such pairs, with\nNf +Nc < k < 3Nf \u2212Nc. (11)\n(Note that k > 3\/2Nf is implied by (1).) So, altogether we have gauge group\nSU (Nc)\u00d7 SU (Nf ) , (12)\nand\n\u2022 one chiral multiplet, Q, in the (Nc, Nf),\n\u2022 one chiral multiplet, Q\u02dc, in the (N c, Nf) ,\n\u2022 k chiral multiplets, \u03c1, in the (1, Nf),\n\u2022 k chiral multiplets, \u03c1\u02dc, in the (1, Nf) .\nThe one loop beta function coefficient of the flavour coupling is greater than zero, and\nhence the microscopic theory is well defined in the UV region. For the tree level potential\nwe take\nW = mTr\n(\nQQ\u02dc\n)\n+ \u03c3Tr (\u03c1\u03c1\u02dc) , (13)\n4\nwhere the mass sigma is taken to be far below the susy breaking scale, in order to ensure\nthat these degrees of freedom contribute to the running coupling at and above the susy\nbreaking scale. We assume2\n\u039bf < \u039bc, (14)\nwhere \u039bf is the scale at which the flavour coupling diverges. In the region where the flavour\ncoupling is still small whereas the colour coupling becomes large, we replace the theory by\nan equivalent formulation. The dual theory is obtained by performing the same duality as\nin the previous section on the colour group. One obtains a theory with dual gauge group\nSU(N = Nf \u2212Nc)\u00d7 SU(Nf ). (15)\nThe dual spectrum consists of\n\u2022 one chiral multiplet, \u03d5, in the (N,Nf),\n\u2022 one chiral multiplet, \u03d5\u02dc, in the (N,Nf) ,\n\u2022 k chiral multiplets, \u03c1, in the (1, Nf),\n\u2022 k chiral multiplets, \u03c1\u02dc, in the (1, Nf) ,\n\u2022 one chiral multiplet \u03a6 in the (1, 1) + (1, N2f \u2212 1).\nAs before, the one loop beta function coefficient of the colour group is negative. If k\nsatisfies (11), the one loop beta function coefficient of the flavour group is less than zero.\nHence, the flavour group stays in its perturbative regime as long as none of the flavour\ncharged matter becomes massive.\nNext, we need to identify the scale \u039b\u02dcf , at which the dual flavour coupling becomes\nlarge. We propose that the relation is\n\u039b\n3Nf\u2212Nc\u2212k\nf \u039b\u02dc\n\u2212(3Nf\u2212Nf\u2212N\u2212k)\nf = \u039b\u02c6\n\u2212N\u039b\n3(Nf\u2212Nc)\nc \u03b1\nNf2\u2212Nf . (16)\nWe have no strict derivation for (16). We can provide only some reasoning. The \u039b\u02c6 depen-\ndence is fixed by imposing that \u039b\u02c6 parameterises unknown factors in the Ka\u00a8hler potential\nfor \u03d5 and \u03d5\u02dc [1]. In the theory with ungauged flavour, discussed in the previous section,\nthere is a scaling symmetry of the superpotential and the matching relation (5) involving\ndual quantities\n\u03d5\u2192 \u03b3\u03d5, \u03d5\u02dc\u2192 \u03b3\u03d5\u02dc, \u039b\u02c6\u2192 \u03b32\u039b\u02c6, \u03a6\u2192 \u03b30\u03a6. (17)\nOur proposal (16) respects that symmetry. Since \u039bc is used throughout, in order to obtain\ncanonical mass dimensions, we did so in (16) as well3. The \u03b1 dependence is due to (7), and\n2Here, and in the following, it should be understood that we compare real parts of dynamically generated\nscales.\n3Taking a flavour scale instead would mean that the relation alters its form upon giving one of the pairs\nin the (1, Nf ) and\n(\n1, Nf\n)\na large mass and integrating it out. Using \u039b\u02dcc would spoil the \u2018symmetry\u2019 (17)\nunless it comes together with \u039b\u02c6 in an invariant combination. But such a combination is \u039bc.\n5\nthe anomalous rescaling of the adjoint. The numerical coefficient 2\u2212Nf will be discussed in\nthe end of the fourth section.\nFor the dual tree level potential4 we obtain\nW = hTr (\u03d5\u02dc\u03a6\u03d5)\u2212 h\u00b52Tr\u03a6 + \u03c3Tr (\u03c1\u03c1\u02dc) . (18)\nIn the dual theory we are interested in a situation where the dual flavour coupling\ndiverges farther in the ultraviolet than the dual colour coupling\n\u039b\u02dcc < \u039b\u02dcf . (19)\nThis condition is not invariant under the previously discussed scaling symmetry. One has\nto supplement it with the requirement of canonical kinetic terms.\nTo see whether this involves some fine tuning we combine (5) and (16) into\n\u039b\n2(Nf\u2212Nc)\nf\n(\n\u039b\u02dcf\n\u039bf\n)k+Nf+N\u22123Nf\n=\n(\u03b1\n2\n)Nf\n(\u039bc)\n2(Nf\u2212Nc)\n(\n\u039b\u02dcc\n\u039bc\n)N(Nf\u22123N)\nNf\n. (20)\nThe hierarchy imposed by \u039bf < \u039bc and \u039b\u02dcf > \u039b\u02dcc implies\n(\u03b1\n2\n)Nf (\u039bc\n\u039bf\n)2(Nf\u2212Nc)(\u039b\u02dcc\n\u039bc\n)b\u02dcf\u2212 NNf b\u02dcc\n> 1, (21)\nwith\nb\u02dcf = 3Nf \u2212N \u2212Nf \u2212 k, b\u02dcc = 3N \u2212Nf , (22)\nbeing the (negative) one loop beta function coefficients of dual flavour and colour, re-\nspectively. We require further that there is a region where electric and magnetic gauge\ncouplings are finite, i.e. \u039b\u02dcc\/\u039bc > 1. The inequality (21) holds naturally, if the dual colour\ncoupling diverges fast enough, compared to the flavour coupling, for the exponent in (21)\nto be positive. Otherwise some fine tuning on \u039bc\/\u039bf is needed.\n4 Meta-Stable Susy Breaking with Gauged Flavour?\nAs in [1] there is no supersymmetric vacuum in the perturbative regime. The potential\nis minimised by (8). The colour group is broken completely whereas the flavour group is\nbroken to SU (Nf \u2212N = Nc). Some of the classical moduli provide the missing degrees\nof freedom for massive vector multiplets of broken flavour. Others acquire a D-term tree\nlevel mass due to the equations of motion of the flavour gauge degrees of freedom. Our\ncondition that \u03c3 is smaller than the susy breaking scale means that at the susy breaking\n4Note that a term Tr\u03c1\u02dc\u03a6\u03c1 would correspond to a non renormalisable coupling in the microscopic theory.\nWe do not consider this case.\n6\nscale quantum corrections to the mass of \u03c1 and \u03c1\u02dc dominate over the tree level mass \u03c3.\nHence, \u03c1 and \u03c1\u02dc can effectively considered to be massless. One loop quantum corrections\nto their mass cancel since supersymmetry breaking is mediated only by gauge degrees of\nfreedom whose mass spectrum is classically fermion-boson degenerate [1]. If they are not\nstabilised by higher order quantum corrections they can gain a vacuum expectation value\nup to \u03c3Tr \u3008\u03c1\u02dc\u03c1\u3009 being of the order of the susy breaking scale. The situation is similar to one\nof the examples in [5] where it was concluded that the given information is not sufficient\nfor making statements about the stability of the vacuum. Instead of speculating about the\nnature of higher order quantum corrections to the susy breaking vacuum, we try to get\ninsight into non perturbative flavour corrections to the supersymmetric vacuum.\nTo this end, we give a VEV to \u03a6. Then the bifundamentals \u03d5, \u03d5\u02dc become massive.\nBelow this mass both gauge groups become asymptotically free, if k < 2Nf . (As we will\nsee shortly the adjoint becomes also massive and below that mass the flavour group is\nalways asymptotically free.)\nThe supersymmetric moduli space of the colour sector is well understood [13,16]. Due\nto the presence of the adjoint (traceless part of \u03a6) the flavour sector is more complicated.\nThere are some partial results in the literature [17\u201322]. It is, however, not obvious to us\nhow to use these results in the given situation. Therefore, we will impose the simplifying\nassumption that the flavour group becomes strongly coupled at much lower energies than\nthe colour group5. We assume further, that non perturbative effects within the flavour\ngroup can be neglected at the mass of the bifundamentals where the two theories decouple.\nDue to instanton corrections within the colour group the superpotential (18) is supple-\nmented by an additional contribution6\nW npc = N\n(\n\u039b\u02dc\n\u2212(Nf\u22123N)\nc det h\u03a6\n)1\/N\n. (23)\nThe traceless part of \u03a6 acquires a mass\nmN2\nf\n\u22121 = \u2212\nh2\n2Nf\nTrh\u03a6\n(\nTrh\u03a6\nNf \u039b\u02dcc\n)Nf\u22123N\nN\n. (24)\nAfter integrating out the traceless part, we fix \u03a6 to be of the form\n\u03a6 = p1Nf , (25)\nand the masses of the bifundamentals become\nm\u03d5 = m\u03d5\u02dc = hp. (26)\n5After decoupling the bifundamentals, the one loop beta function coefficients are: 3 (Nf \u2212Nc) for the\nmagnetic colour group, and at most Nf \u2212Nc for the flavour group. So, the colour coupling will diverge at\nhigher scales than the flavour one.\n6For the case Nf = Nc + 1 see the discussion in [1].\n7\nAssuming that the decoupling of the flavour group at hp occurs above the scale at which\nthe coupling becomes strong, we can treat its non perturbative effects separately. After\nthe adjoint and the bifundamentals decouple we obtain SU(Nf ) gauge theory with k pairs\nof quarks and anti-quarks. Now, since 3Nf > k > 3\/2Nf , the Seiberg dual of the flavour\ntheory is also asympotically free. However, we can still find a non trivial supersymmetric\nvacuum by giving a vacuum expectation value to the dual of Tr\u03c1\u03c1\u02dc. For this case, we can\nadapt the result for the supersymmetric vacuum from7 (10)\n\u03c1\u03c1\u02dc = \u03c32\n(\n\u039b\u02dcf,L\n\u03c3\n) 3Nf\u2212k\nNf\n1 k, (27)\nwhere\n\u039b\u02dc\n3Nf\u2212k\nL,f = \u039b\u02dc\n\u2212(N+k\u22122Nf)\nf (hp)\nN m\nNf\nN2\nf\n\u22121\n. (28)\nPlugging this back into (27) we obtain\n\u03c3\u03c1\u03c1\u02dc = \u22121\n2\n\u03c3\nk\nNf\n(\nhN \u039b\u02dc\n\u2212(N+k\u22122Nf)\nf\n) 1\nNf\n(\nhNf \u039b\u02dc\n3N\u2212Nf\nc\n) 1\nN\np\nNf\nN\n\u2212\nNf +Nc\nNf 1 k. (29)\nIn our approximation the superpotential becomes finally,\nW = N\n(\nhNf \u039b\u02dc\n\u2212(Nf\u22123N)\nc p\nNf\n)1\/N\n\u2212 h\u00b52Nf p\n\u2212Nf\n2\n\u03c3\nk\nNf\n(\nhN \u039b\u02dc\n\u2212(N+k\u22122Nf)\nf\n) 1\nNf\n(\nhNf \u039b\u02dc\n3N\u2212Nf\nc\n) 1\nN\np\nNf\nN\n\u2212\nNf+Nc\nNf , (30)\nwhere we have taken into account a contribution from gaugino condensation to the super-\npotential (for details see e.g. [13] section 5.5).\nThe contribution in the second line of (30) has to be small compared to the contribution\nin the first line, for our approximations to be consistent. Within this approximation the\nF-term condition for \u03a6 can be solved to leading order in the correction, yielding\n\u03a6 = \u03a60\n{\n1\u2212 C\n(\n\u03c3khN \u039b\u02dc\n\u2212(k+N\u22122Nf)\nf\n) 1\nNf\n\u03a6\n\u2212\nNf +Nc\nNf\n0\n}\n, (31)\nwhere \u03a60 is the solution for the ungauged flavour case (9), and\nC =\nN\nNf\n(\nNf +Nc\nNf\n\u2212 Nf\nN\n)\n. (32)\nNote, that the correction term contains an Nfth root of unity.\n7There could be also other supersymmetric vacua, we are interested in one giving an effect to our\nconsiderations.\n8\nIn the microscopic language this corresponds to\nQQ\u02dc =\n(\nQQ\u02dc\n)\n0\n{\n1\u2212 2C\u03c3\nk\nNf \u039b\n3Nf\u2212k\u2212Nc\nNf\nf \u039b\n3Nc\u2212Nf\nNf\nc\n(\nQQ\u02dc\n)\n\u2212\nNf +Nc\nNf\n0\n}\n, (33)\nwhere\n(\nQQ\u02dc\n)\n0\ndenotes the solution in the global flavour case (10).\nWith our choice of parameters there is indeed a small correction. If \u03c3 is taken to zero\nthe correction vanishes. Our treatment is valid if non perturbative effects in the flavour\nsector are negligible at the mass of the bifundamentals, where magnetic colour and flavour\ndecouple.\nNow, let us come back to the candidate for meta-stable susy breaking, discussed in the\nbeginning of this section. If the two loop effective mass squared for \u03c1 and \u03c1\u02dc is negative\nthese fields would condense breaking the residual flavour symmetry. Some of the degrees\nof freedom become part of a massive vector field. The \u2018mesons\u2019 \u03c1\u03c1\u02dc could condense further.\nThese are singlets under the gauged colour and flavour groups. The backreaction of such\na condensation would be suppressed. Therefore, it seems plausible that the \u03c1\u03c1\u02dc direction is\nalong a valley where the position of \u03a6 and the hight of the potential walls stays effectively\nconstant. Flavour would return to a global symmetry which is spontaneously broken in\nthe meta-stable vacuum. On the supersymmetric side we have seen that the width of the\npotential wall can be shortened by the condensation of \u03c1\u03c1\u02dc. Since our approach is limited\nto a situation where this shortening of the width is only a small percentage we cannot say\nwhether such effects could be significant for the life time of the meta-stable vacuum in the\ncase that flavour and colour interactions are of comparable strength at the susy breaking\nscale.\nFinally, let us come back to the relation (16) and reason for the numerical coefficient\n2\u2212Nf . Plugging our approximate solution (33) into (30) one obtains\nW = Nc\n(\n\u039b\n3Nc\u2212Nf\nc m\nNf\n) 1\nNc\n+Nf\n(\n\u039b\n3Nf\u2212Nc\u2212k\nf m\nNc\u03c3k\n) 1\nNf + . . . , (34)\nwhere dots stand for terms higher order in \u03c3 which cannot be computed within our approx-\nimation. The superpotential (34) is the sum of contributions from gaugino condensation\nin the colour and flavour group with the correct numerical factors (see e.g. [13]). This\nexplains our choice in (16).\n5 Conclusions\nModifying the models of [1] by gauging flavour can serve as a toy model for gauge mediation\nof meta-stable susy breaking, where the hidden sector role is played by the colour gauge\ntheory whereas the flavour gauge theory acts as the visible sector. We found that in the\nmodified model it is much harder to derive exact results and make definite statements\nabout meta-stability. However, we were able to compute corrections to the location of the\nsupersymmetric vacuum due to non perturbative effects in the gauged flavour sector as\n9\nlong as these effects are small. These corrections shift the position of the supersymmetric\nvacuum towards the non supersymmetric one. Ensuring that non perturbative effects in the\nvisible sector are highly suppressed at the susy breaking scale (as well in the supersymmetric\nvacuum as in the non supersymmetric one) would keep these corrections small. We do not\nknow the first non trivial quantum corrections to some masses in the non supersymmetric\nvacuum. This would require a two loop calculation. Moreover, we lack an exact knowledge\nof the moduli space of supersymmetric vacua, for general couplings. In order to improve\nthe situation one could e.g. try to modify the matter sector transforming under flavour.\nFor instance, the models discussed in [4] have also product gauge groups and are under\nbetter control. (However, also the authors of [4] restrict to a decoupled situation when\nidentifying the supersymmetric vacuum.) Also recent brane constructions [23, 24] may be\nhelpful.\nAcknowledgements\nI would like to thank David Cerden\u02dco for useful discussions.\nReferences\n[1] K. Intriligator, N. Seiberg and D.
