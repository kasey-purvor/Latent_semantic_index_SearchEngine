It \nargues, contra William Meyer (2000, 2002), that the reasons for this massive \nbehavioural change are traceable to an underlying demand for greater comfort, \nand to the complex market forces involved in the development of the technology \nto satisfy it and an industry to create and sell the resulting appliances, rather than \nsimply to the increase in the price of the prevailing fuel, firewood.  An attempt is \nmade to extract \u201elessons\u201f from this history \u2013 plausible parallels with later \ntransformations in the technology of comfort. \n \nKeywords: cooking, comfort, heating, indoor environmental quality, innovation, \nstove, supply chains, technology diffusion, United States \n \nIntroduction \nIn the three decades before the Civil War, the people of the United States \n(particularly of the northern states) experienced a revolution in domestic \ntechnology, and the beginnings of a major fuel transition.  The result was a \nsignificant rise in their expectations of comfort and convenience in everyday life, \nas well as an improvement in their ability economically to satisfy those rising \nexpectations.  What enabled these changes was the development of the cast-iron \nstove, increasingly reliant as the century progressed on coal (at first anthracite, \nlater bituminous too) rather than wood.  It was transformed over a long \ngeneration, between the 1820s and the 1850s, from an expensive item of restricted \nutility, and thus in limited demand, into the first consumer durable with near-\nuniversal market penetration \u2013 available, affordable, versatile, and reliable.  \nAcross the northern states, stoves for cooking and\/or space- and water-heating \nbecame ubiquitous and indispensable in private houses, public accommodations \n(restaurants, hotels and lodging houses, steamboats and railroad carriages), places \nof work and of business (factories, stores, offices, banks), and public institutions \n(schools, churches, hospitals, asylums, prisons) alike.  \n 3 \nSome contemporary observers were unconvinced that the new technology \nwas better than what it displaced; in the language of architectural critic Andrew \nJackson Downing, it was a \u201cnational curse,\u201d and the \u201cfavorite poison of America\u201d \nwas the stuffy, overheated interior climate it created (Downing, 1858, pp. 278-9 \nesp.).  Downing may have been the \u201capostle of [contemporary middle-class] taste\u201d \n(Schuyler, 1996), but the evidence of consumer behaviour is overwhelming: \nwhatever reservations Americans may have harboured about the replacement of \nopen fires by close stoves, they bought the latter by the million and reorganized \ntheir lives around them.  (See Figure 1, and Garrett, 1990, esp. pp. 72, 96, 99, 101, \nand 183-91; Larkin, 1988, esp. pp. 51-2, 140-1; Martin, 1942, esp. pp. 113-4, 116-\n47; Nylander, 1993, esp. Ch. 4).  As Sylvester Judd wrote in his blank-verse epic \nPhilo, published in the year Downing\u201fs anti-stove tirade first appeared, his \nprotagonist was \u201cA man like other men\u201d \u2013 he \u201chates \/ An air-tight stove, but \ncannot buy a better\u201d (Judd, 1850, p. 125).   \u201eBurr-Oak,\u201f a pseudonymous reviewer \nwho agreed with Downing, expressed the fire-worshippers' problem precisely: the \ncast-iron stove had become \u201ca hopelessly necessary evil\u201d (\u201eBurr-Oak,\u201f 1850, p. \n125).  To Henry French, editor of the New England Farmer, who yielded to \nnobody in his nostalgia for the open fire, the only important choice for most \nmiddle-class consumers by the 1850s was whether to stick with the stove or \nprogress to the use of a basement furnace, which provided whole-house heating.  \nAll other questions could be safely left to \u201cthose who believe that the earth goes \nbackward sometimes\u201d (French, 1856, p. 45).   \n \n 4 \nFigure 1: Estimated U.S. Stove Production, 1830-1870 (Dwyer, 1895, p. 361) \n \n-\n500,000\n1,000,000\n1,500,000\n2,000,000\n2,500,000\n1830 1840 1850 1860 1870\n100%\n150%\n200%\n250%\n300%\n350%\nDecadal Increase Stove Production\n \n \nA direct result of the rapid take-up of this new domestic technology, as William \nMeyer (2000, pp. 32-3, 74-80, 127-8 esp., and 2002) has written, was that the \nAmerican indoor climate underwent the first of its two great historic changes, \nwith a significant increase in winter warmth (to a norm in the low to mid 70s \nFahrenheit) and a reduction in the presence of, and toleration for, draughts.  (The \nsecond great change took place more gradually, last century, and involved the \n\u201econquest\u201f of summertime heat and humidity via air conditioning \u2013 see Cooper, \n1998.)  Thus, one might suppose, America was early and firmly set on its high-\nenergy-consuming path to the climate-controlled present, laying the deep cultural \nfoundations of patterns of domestic and other architecture, ways of occupying \ninternal space, preferences in clothing, etc., which now constitute formidable \nbarriers in the way of movement towards a more sustainable low-carbon or \nrenewables-based energy economy. \nMeyer\u201fs is almost the only recent work on this increasingly important \ntopic.  The purpose of this article is to question, revise, and extend his explanation \nfor the timing and origins of this great change.  His argument is straightforward, \nand at first sight quite persuasive: what drove the transformation in heating \npractice was less a rising demand for domestic comfort (though this undoubtedly \n 5 \nexisted \u2013 see Crowley, 2001) than the increasing cost and difficulty of \nmaintaining prevailing levels of domestic discomfort (low indoor winter \ntemperatures, abundant draughts).  The price of fuelwood rose sharply in the late \neighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, particularly in the long-settled, \nrelatively densely-populated, rapidly-urbanizing regions of coastal New England \nand the Middle Atlantic states, where timber resources had been most severely \ndepleted by generations of profligate use.  This drove Americans in these regions \nto begin their fuel transition from wood to coal, and also to search for more \nefficient means of using an increasingly scarce, costly renewable resource, as well \nas its initially expensive non-renewable replacement.  The devices they developed \nand used for this purpose (iron stoves) were not altogether new, but were so much \nmore efficient than the open hearths they displaced that Americans were enabled \nto achieve and maintain higher indoor temperatures, far more economically than \nhitherto.  Having done so, over a generation they altered their ideas of what \nconstituted comfort, elevating \u201cnormal\u201d indoor winter temperatures by several \ndegrees, and thereby creating a new, distinctive, and enduring feature of the \nAmerican way of life. \n* * * \nWhat, if anything, is wrong with this account?  Mostly its excessive simplicity; it \nprovides us with an explanation for change that is at most necessary and certainly \nvery far from sufficient.  One might think, reading it, that, with enough of a push \nfrom rising fuel prices, everything else followed smoothly and unproblematically.  \nThe reason why American consumers did not make this change any sooner was \n\u201cnot a matter of necessity but of choice\u201d (Meyer, 2002, p. 399).  Stove heat was \nan available option decades before it became general, \u201cmerely rare because \u2026 \ndisliked\u201d (Meyer, 2000, p. 33).  All that stood in the way of its widespread take-\nup any earlier was a culturally-rooted consumer resistance.   \nThe purpose of this article is to add in some complexity, to explain what \nelse was needed in order to enable Americans to make a quite difficult series of \nbehavioural changes, and to suggest that an enriched appreciation of this first \ntransition more than a century and a half ago may be of some interest, and even \n 6 \nuse, as we contemplate what may be required in order to begin a new transition \ntowards a lower-carbon future. \n \n1. The Setting: The U.S. Economy in the Early National Period \nIn the first quarter of the nineteenth century the (white) population of the northern \nUnited States already enjoyed one of the world\u201fs highest material standards of \nliving.  In relative terms, even if the comparators are limited to the most \ndeveloped nations of Western Europe at the same time, their society was \ntechnologically advanced \u2013 highly literate, numerate, future-oriented, valuing \npracticality, seeing improvement in the machinery of everyday existence as a vital \npart of what would come to be called \u201cThe Promise of American Life.\u201d  \nMechanical skills were well distributed throughout the population.  Entrepreneurs \nwere hungry for new ideas to capitalize, mechanics avid for opportunities to turn \ntheir inventions into marketable goods and thus, they hoped, personal wealth.  The \nmeans for making these new products and bringing them to the attention of \nAmerican consumers were increasingly efficient \u2013 the northern United States not \nonly had multiple, well-disseminated nodes of manufacturing expertise, but also \nthe apparatus of an already quite mature commercial economy to close the gap \nbetween makers and end-users of new technologies.  A large domestic market \nexisted, at least in potential, well served by networks of wholesalers and retailers, \nincreasingly well equipped to bring new products before one of the world\u201fs \nlargest, richest, and most rapidly-growing pools of consumers, where the number \nof households was doubling every generation (see Cochran, 1981 and Meyer, \n2003). \nHowever, the United States of the early nineteenth century was at one and \nthe same time both a relatively advanced and dynamic market economy and also a \nremarkably decentralized one.  At the 1830 federal census, for example, New \nEngland and the Middle Atlantic states were indeed America\u201fs most highly \nurbanized \u2013 they contained just 43 percent of the total U.S. population, but 69 \npercent of its town and city dwellers.  Yet the census definition of an urban place \nwas and remained quite undemanding \u2013 a concentrated settlement with at least \n2,500 people \u2013 and such towns and cities only accounted for about a seventh of \n 7 \neven these most developed regions\u201f population.  The national figure for the urban \nproportion was about one-eleventh.  A generation later in 1860, after the \u201cstove \nrevolution\u201d had occurred, New England and the Middle Atlantic states were more \nthan a third urban, by the same criteria, and the United States as a whole about \none-fifth (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1970). \nThus at the end almost as much as at the beginning of this great \ntransformation, the overwhelming majority of American consumers, even outside \nof the South, lived widely scattered across a vast rural hinterland.  The pressures \nof fuelwood shortages and price increases, and the opportunities of alternative \n(mineral) fuels, were encountered very unevenly across these diverse \ncommunities.  And yet, outside of the South, and even in regions which remained \nfuelwood-dependent, the conversion from open fires to stoves took place.   \n Evidently the fuel-price push will not do all the explanatory work required \nof it.  It fits best the situation in and around the port cities of the eastern seaboard, \nwhere the major innovations in stove design, manufacture, and distribution were \nmade between the 1810s and 1840s, and the early adopters of the new technology \nwere to be found.  But, even there, it encounters a basic evidence problem: the \nlack of consistent historical price series to provide it with an unambiguous \nfoundation.  Occasional crises in fuelwood supply, leading to localized absolute \nshortages, may have been more influential than gradual price inflation in driving \nthe evolution and adoption of stove technology, and its associated fuel transition \ntowards anthracite.   \n The fuel-price push idea works even less well in explaining something \nmuch more important than just the timing and location of the beginnings of \nchange \u2013 its diffusion in less than a generation, from coast to coast and into the \nurban South, even into regions where fuelwood was still abundant.  If stove \nheating had not become the norm across the rural North, one would not have been \nable to write in generalizing terms about a culture-wide shift towards a new \ninternal climate; this would have remained a strictly urban and regional \nphenomenon, which it did not. \n Unfortunately we lack good data on the proportions of households with \nstoves at particular times or in particular places.  However, there are some good \n 8 \nindicators of the emergence of this new normality across the North \u2013 not just the \nEuropean travellers' tales on which Meyer relies, which are most useful for urban \nand middle-class environments, but, for example, the evidence of legal evolution.  \nAs early as the 1820s states began to include a stove among the basic household \nitems, essential tools of the trade, and small farmers' livestock and fodder, which \nwere protected against seizure in settlement of personal debts (Prison Discipline \nSociety, 1830, p. 41; McCurdy, 2001, p. 65).  As Senator Rowan of Kentucky \ncommented on Maine's 1824 statute, exempting \u201cone swine, seven sheep, and one \nstove, &c.  The rigor of the climate makes the warmth of wool, and of the stove, \nnecessaries, as much so -- to the comfort of the bodies of the poor -- as the flesh \nof swine to their stomachs\u201d (Register of Debates, 1826, col. 424).  These laws \nsignified that the stove had already become recognized, like his family Bible and \nchildren's schoolbooks, as a part of the ordinary citizen's decent minimum of \npossessions, even before its ownership had in fact become universal.  But by the \nCivil War decade, with one stove being sold for every five households in 1860, \nand one for every four in 1870, a mature, indeed saturated market for these new \nconsumer durables had been created.  \n* * * \nAmericans\u201f dispersed patterns of settlement affected the adoption of the new \ntechnology of stove heating, and also the transition to mineral fuels, in particular \nbecause the high cost and low efficiency of most of the prevailing means of \ntransporting goods at the start of the period meant that most potential stove \nconsumers were in practice insulated against change by barriers of distance, time, \nand cost.  Until the 1840s, unless consumers lived a relatively short wagon trip \naway from a navigable waterway, the ability of most of them to buy heavy, bulky \ngoods, or those with a low value-to-weight ratio, from any but local makers and \nsuppliers, was quite restricted.  Similar considerations applied to the manufacture \nof such goods: from the 1810s through the late 1830s, for example, the making of \nheavy cast-iron products like stoves stayed tied to the blast furnaces providing \ntheir raw material, i.e. it was more or less confined to those locations where iron \nore from mines or bogs, flux (limestone or sea-shells), and fuel (charcoal) could \nbe sourced close to one another.  Rural furnaces making stoves were scattered \n 9 \nthrough eastern Pennsylvania and southern New Jersey, conveniently close to \nmajor urban markets in Philadelphia and New York; but such producers\u201f non-\nlocal markets were effectively limited to other port communities along the \nAtlantic littoral from Washington, DC to Maine, and those inland towns with \ngood water transport links. \nCommunication between makers, sellers, and consumers, and the rate and \ndiffusion of innovations, were hindered for as long as the emerging stove \nindustry\u201fs constituent parts remained widely diffused, with slow, inefficient \nlinkages among them.  There was little technical development either in stoves \nthemselves or in methods of making them.  Small-scale manufacture of crude, \nheavy objects, and costly transportation, readily translated into making stoves \nhigh-priced goods which could only secure niche markets.  Such niches were \navailable, and widening \u2013 notably in the coastal towns and cities most exposed to \nthe problems of occasional actual fuelwood shortages and chronically rising \nprices, and enjoying relatively cheap, efficient water-borne communications.  But \ntransforming stoves from products which some consumers in some of the \ncountry\u201fs most developed regions bought (the situation in the 1810s-early 1830s), \ninto products which were basic to the transformed lifestyles of millions of \nconsumers right across the United States (the situation by the end of the 1850s), \nrequired much more than the gradual inclusion of more and more households \namong those feeling the pinch of high fuelwood prices. \n \n 10 \n2. America\u2019s Wooden Age \nThere is another problem with the \u201chigh fuelwood price\u201d argument.  It seems to \nbe based on a limited understanding of the energy economy of early nineteenth-\ncentury America.  At the mid-point almost as much as at the beginning of the \ntransition from open-fire to stove-using, the United States remained fuelwood-\ndependent, certainly throughout the rural heartland.  Wood still provided 90 \npercent of the American fuel supply in 1850 \u2013 75 percent as late as 1870, when its \nconsumption reached an all-time peak \u2013 and 90 percent of it continued to be used \nfor domestic purposes: \u201ccooking, drying, smoking, and process heat for home \nmanufactures\u201d as well as space heating (Greenberg, 1980, pp. 34, 41).  In some \nAmerican energy markets, notably those of the East Coast cities, it is plausible \nthat the high price and unreliable availability of fuelwood drove both the search \nfor substitutes, notably Pennsylvania anthracite from the late 1820s on (Chandler, \n1972, pp. 153-55; Powell, 1978, esp. Chs. 2-3), and for more efficient ways of \nburning the new fuel as well as the old (Silliman, 1826; Bull, 1827; Olmsted, \n1837).  But we also need to be able to account for the quite rapid embrace of the \nresulting innovations in regions not feeling the same clear stimuli of price and \nshortage.  As Henry French explained in 1856, recalling and explaining the \ntransition from open fires to stoves in rural New England, \nwood was reckoned of little value on the lot.  But \u2026 at every respectable \nestablishment, it was the winter's work for two men, and a team of four \noxen and as many steers, to get up the years [sic] stock of fuel.  The men \nand teams were off by daylight, and brought home the wood, sled-length, \nload after load, and rolled it up into huge piles in the door-yard, and he \nwas considered an uncommonly forehanded farmer, who ever had a stock \nof seasoned wood on hand. And so they toiled all summer, to raise corn \nand hay and potatoes enough, to keep the men and teams through the \nwinter, and worked all winter long, getting up wood to keep from \nfreezing (p. 44). \nWe need, at the very least, to appreciate what the non-monetary cost of the old \nfuelwood economy was to the rural consumers dependent on it.  The issue for \nmost of them was not so much the market price of a vital commodity that was still \n 11 \nabundant in many localities (notably as a by-product of land clearance), and \nwhich many rural consumers provided for themselves, but the strong attraction of \nreducing the massive household labour inputs required to feed the voracious open \nhearth \u2013 felling, trimming, cutting, moving, piling, splitting and perhaps cutting \nagain, and then yet more carrying, to the fireplace itself (Cole, 1970, esp. pp. 343-\n4).  Greenberg (1980)\u201fs estimate is that fuelwood preparation required more \ncaloric inputs (in terms of human food and animal feed) than the usable heat \noutput it generated, because of the extremely low conversion efficiency of the \nopen hearth; and it is not clear whether her estimate includes the women\u201fs labour \nentailed within the home, as well as the men\u201fs in the woodlot and at the woodpile.  \nAnything that promised to improve the balance of this equation was quite rapidly \nadopted by American consumers, even without the direct stimulus of market \nprice.  Knowledge of the efficiency gains possible by replacing open fires with \nstoves was well disseminated: improvements of eight or nine times \u2013 from a 10 to \nan 80-90 percent conversion ratio -- were achievable under laboratory conditions \nby the late 1820s, and of perhaps half that much in everyday practice.  Stove \nmakers emphasized the saving of labour alongside the saving of fuel per se, and \nthe greater usable heat output.  The selling points of the new technology were thus \ncomfort, convenience, and economy \u2013 a winning combination, against which \nculturally-engrained preferences for the open fire provided at best feeble \nresistance.  \nBut only once the choice of the new technology of controlled, more \nefficient combustion became effectively available to them.  Note the adverb: \neffectively.  For cash-poor rural consumers, dependent on wagon transport along \ninadequate roads and living far from market centres, the crude, heavy, costly \ndevices American furnaces produced from the 1760s through the early 1830s were \nrarely an attractive or affordable option.  When in the late 1810s and early 1820s \nanthracite pioneer Jacob Cist wished to grow his fuel market by encouraging stove \nuse, he had to resort to a variety of stratagems, even in the immediate vicinity of \nhis mines \u2013 renting stoves out as well as selling them, accepting labour services or \ngoods instead of cash (Powell, 1978, pp. 92-3).  The nature of the product and its \ndistribution system would have to be transformed before the potential mass \n 12 \nmarket could be tapped, and millions of tired, freezing Americans would come to \nenjoy, and take for granted, the (redefined) comforts of home. \n \n3. Escaping Winter: From God\u2019s House to My House \nThere are two more modifications to the \u201chigh fuelwood price\u201d argument that are \nworth developing.  The first is to question Meyer\u201fs contention that the changeover \nto stoves was not \u201cdriven chiefly by a desire for greater comfort\u201d (2002, p. 398).  \nEven if this was not the major cause, it is clear that the desire existed, and \nmotivated much consumer behaviour, notably among the early adopters of what \nwas at that time a very costly, imperfect appliance.  Given the facts of early \nstoves\u201f high price and limited utility and availability, then, even in the seaboard \ntowns and cities, and areas of their hinterlands with comparatively efficient freight \ntransport and prosperous market economies, they were a niche product for \nwealthy, go-ahead consumers \u2013 people who knew about Benjamin Franklin\u201fs and \nCount Rumford\u201fs innovations and arguments, and had ample means to buy the \nnew technology of comfort.  When the young Revolutionary War hero Aaron Burr \nset up as a lawyer in Albany, New York in the early 1780s, for example, his love-\nletters to his wife-to-be were surprisingly full of advice on the advantages of \nstoves, what type to buy, where and how to set them up, etc.  Stove purchase in \nhis case seems to have been a response to the possession of discretionary spending \npower, and knowledge of the comfort and status you could buy with it, rather than \nsimply to considerations of domestic economy  (Parton, 1860, pp. 134, 137).  A \nfew years later, on the frontier of settlement in upstate New York, a stove was a \nsymbol of wealth, power, and modernity in the wilderness, as well as a bringer of \ncomfort to visitors to the community\u201fs most powerful citizen.  \u201cThe door closed, \nand the party were at once removed from an atmosphere that was nearly at zero, to \none of sixty degrees above. In the centre of the hall stood an enormous stove, the \nsides of which appeared to be quivering with the heat it emitted\u201d (Cooper, 1823, \np. 74).  James Fenimore Cooper\u201fs father \u2013 the lightly-fictionalized source for his \nwilderness patriarch -- was engaging in what one might term the conspicuous \nconsumption of warmth, rather than attempting to cut his fuel bills.  Such winter \ncomfort was in short supply in late eighteenth and early nineteenth century \n 13 \nAmerica, where the urban lower classes, in particular, lived with chronic fuel \npoverty (Adams, 2008), but it was evidently sought out, when and where \navailable, by those with the power to make a choice.  When Hessian troops were \nlooking for somewhere to use as a hospital and barracks in southern New Jersey in \n1778, for example, they chose the Atsion Friends\u201f meetinghouse, because it was \none of the few buildings with a stove (Sarapin, 1994, p. 153). \nWe do not have much quantitative data about the spread of stove \npurchasing and use even among prosperous east-coast consumers in the next half-\ncentury, but we do have quite powerful indirect evidence.  Enough of them \nbecame used to stoves in their homes and business premises that they began to \nexert a strong and effective demand for the extension of a comfort they now took \nfor granted into a kind of public space where it had rarely existed: their places of \nworship  (Buggeln, 2003, esp. pp. 96, 202; Washburn, 1860, p. 110).  Stove use in \nchurches began to spread into New England from the 1790s on, beyond its origins \namong the Pennsylvania Dutch, the Moravians, and the Quakers who had adopted \nthis one of their neighbours\u201f sensible practices.  It became normal in the 1810s \nand early 1820s.  As the author of a version of a common apocryphal story about \nthe first encounter of Puritan worshippers with a stove-warmed meeting house \nreflected, a generation after the events he recounted, \u201cIt is strange how fast any \nlittle comfort or convenience grows popular and makes its way among a people, \nafter it first becomes known; and how soon it ceases to be a luxury, and becomes \none of the necessaries of life\u201d (Anon., 1845, p. 82).   \nNot, perhaps, so strange: churches were barn-like buildings, left empty \nand, in winter, freezing through much of the week, and neither capable of being \neffectively warmed by open hearths nor indeed, because of concerns about fire \nrisk, generally equipped with them at all.  Their congregations had to sit through \nlong services and, worst of all, interminable sermons, with nothing apart from \ntheir fervour (or, for some women and the elderly, charcoal-burning individual \nfoot-stoves) to keep them warm.  They could wrap up well, stamp their feet, \nbeseech their minister to cut his sermon short, defrost themselves between \nmorning and afternoon services in small Sabbath-Day houses (huts in the \nchurchyard with a cooking hearth), retreat to a smaller, less frigid building for \n 14 \nmidwinter services, even give them up altogether until the worst was over.  Or \nthey could install stoves \u2013 as Meyer correctly argues, an available technology \ndecades before they came into common use, but one effectively accessible, even \nalong the north-east seaboard, only to the relatively wealthy or, in this case, to \ncollective or institutional purchasers.   \nThe choice became an obvious one \u2013 suffer like the poor Methodists of \nCincinnati, Ohio, in 1811, who still could not afford a stove to heat their meeting-\nhouse: \u201con Sunday morning it being generally crowded, their breath would \ncondense on the walls, and the water would run down and across the floor\u201d \n(Finley, 1857, p. 90).  Or throw away your foot-stoves, close the Sabbath-Day \nhouses, and enter the new world of pious comfort.  By the early 1820s, \ncongregations along the eastern seaboard had discovered that they did not have to \nfreeze through wintertime worship, and thereafter churches and meeting-houses, \nthose most important of public spaces, were routinely heated by stoves and \nfurnaces as part of a general move to extend domestic comforts (including carpets, \ncushions, and better furniture) into the house of God (see e.g. Benedict, 1860, \np. 279).  Something similar began to happen in Victorian Britain a little later, \nwhere it also met with some resistance (Hare 1856, Vol. 1, p. 105), but in the \nUnited States stove-heated comfort and godliness were reconciled from an early \ndate. \nWhen a new kind of public space \u2013 the railroad carriage \u2013 appeared in the \n1830s, the gulf that had already opened up  between the United States and the \nUnited Kingdom in terms of the perceived need for space heating and \nexpectations of indoor comfort again became manifest.  American railroad \ncarriages were stove-heated almost from the outset, in the first instance with \ndevices adapted from ordinary room-heaters, later with variants on the domestic \nfurnace (White, 1985, pp. 379-400).  British visitors remarked unfailingly upon \nthe consequences, usually negatively -- overheated, airless, stinking carriages, \nintolerable temperature gradients depending on proximity to the stove (the classic \ncases are Dickens, 1842, Vol. 1, p. 146 and Trollope, 1862, p. 389; whenever \neither of these great authors came across a warm interior, he complained bitterly); \nbut occasionally positively (Godley, 1844, Vol. 2, p. 140; Lyell, 1845, Vol. 1, pp. \n 15 \n140-41; Chambers, 1854, p. 26), travellers making an explicit comparison with \nthe rigours of even first-class travel on unheated British railways in winter.  \nRailroad stoves were an enormous fire hazard, which Americans tolerated for \nmore than half a century as the price of the necessary, albeit imperfect, comfort \nthat they provided (Aldrich, 2006, pp. 79-82). \nThe point of this discussion of what may have been two of the most \nimportant ways in which the experience of being warm in wintertime while at rest \nindoors was diffused beyond the relatively wealthy early adopters of stove \ntechnology to their less affluent neighbours, is that it has nothing to do with any \nsupposed fuel-price shock in the early nineteenth century, and everything to do \nwith the simple avoidance of discomfort.  Given what we know about the \nexceptional severity of winters in the northern states in the late eighteenth-early \nnineteenth centuries, the clear inadequacy of prevailing (open fire) heating \nsystems, and the lack even of basic \u201cwinterizing\u201d features in American domestic \narchitecture, then it is perverse to turn our backs on the blindingly obvious in our \nexplanation of why ordinary people adopted the new technology for their homes \ntoo, almost as soon as it became effectively available to them.  The pursuit of \ngreater comfort, in a variety of settings, domestic and public, seems to have been \na powerful force for behavioural change in its own right. \nNote the above phrase: domestic and public.  If we wish to understand the \nprocess by which the new technology of stove and furnace heating became \nubiquitous in northern American households by mid-century, we should \nappreciate the important role of the challenge of heating non-household settings in \ndriving the development of the new technology.  Open fireplaces could push back \nthe chill by a few feet at most, and create small habitable zones in the worst of \nwinter even in the barely-insulated, draughty, single-glazed houses of the time.  \nBut in legislative assemblies, courthouses, public halls, colleges, prisons, mental \nasylums, hospitals, and that most common of public buildings (after churches) \u2013 \nschools \u2013 fireplaces were ineffective, inappropriate, or both.   Lunatics and \nprisoners, for example, had to be kept tolerably warm for the sake of their health, \nbut could scarcely be trusted with fires in their locked rooms or cells; and large \ninstitutional buildings with tens or even hundreds of separate inhabited spaces \n 16 \nwere far more economically and efficiently heated from a central source than by \nnumerous open fires (Prison Discipline Society, 1855, pp. 11-15, 620-1, 845).  In \ncrowded schoolrooms, \u201c[a]n open fire-place is sometimes dangerous, and even \nfatal, to children dressed in cotton\u201d (Woodbridge, 1832, p. 276).  By the early \n1830s state school laws simply considered \u201carticles ... such as a broom, a water-\npail, a stove, a wood-house, &c.\u201d as \u201cindispensable to the comfort and health of \nthe pupils\u201d (Williams, 1836, p. 267).  Almost all of the voluminous literature on \nthe heating and, equally important, the ventilation of schools, prisons, asylums, \nhospitals, and other public buildings, poured out in the 1830s and 1840s by \narchitects, educationists, and physicians, similarly took stove- or furnace-heating \nfor granted, and concentrated on its improvement (see e.g. Mann, 1838, pp. 13-18; \nBarnard, 1850, pp. 35, 50-53; Burrowes, 1855, Ch. 6; Bell, 1848; Reid, 1858).  \nHistorians, including Meyer, have usually written as if the domestic setting \nwas the only place where the stove revolution took place.  But the means for \nbuying open fires\u201f initially quite costly replacements were much more available to \ninstitutional purchasers than to most households.  It would be more accurate to \npaint a picture of interactions among early adopters (wealthy households), the \npublic institutions whose purchasing behaviour they influenced, and a wider \nconsuming public likely to have encountered warm interior public space well \nbefore they could afford to extend that luxury into their own homes.  The parallel \nwith the spread of air conditioning a century later is suggestive if necessarily \ninexact \u2013 with movie houses and department stores, for example, helping to create \nthe demand for cool summertime interiors decades before most American \nhouseholds could begin to follow suit.  In the case of air conditioning, the \n\u201cindustrial\u201d and domestic (room-sized) technologies were fundamentally \ndifferent; but with stove and furnace heating, they were basically the same \u2013 \nhousehold appliances were just smaller and cheaper versions of a single product \nline.  (See Figure 2, illustrating space-heating stoves and furnaces.)   \n \n 17 \nFigure 2: Space Heating for Public and Private Places (Chilson & Dunklee, \n1850) \nGardner Chilson (1804-1877) was a pioneer inventor and manufacturer of hot-air \nfurnaces for institutional and wealthy private users.  Note the concern for indoor \nair quality as well as thermal efficiency. \n \n \n 18 \n4. Domesticating the Stove: the Problem of Cooking \nThere was one final hurdle \u2013 apart from price \u2013 that had to be crossed before \nordinary northern American households could afford to become dependent on \nstoves.  It relates to what they used fire for, and how they lived in their houses \n(Hazen and Hazen, 1992, esp. Chs. 1, 2, 5).  In most rural homes and among \nurban lower-class households (basically, those without servants), the kitchen was \nnot simply the heart of the home in a sentimental sense, it was the engine-room of \nthe domestic economy and the only room heated in winter.  The kitchen fire \nserved multiple purposes \u2013 cooking, water-heating, processing and preserving \nfood, even producing the wood-ash for the soap supply \u2013 as well as providing \nspace heating, which was almost a by-product; unwanted except in winter, but \nessential then, and unavoidable anyway.   \nBefore the 1820s, available stove types \u2013 6-plate box stoves, Franklins (a \ngeneric term for free-standing cast-iron devices only loosely inspired by Benjamin \nFranklin's original design, which could be inserted into a fireplace and allowed a \nview of the fire), sheet-iron \u201cairtights,\u201d heavy \u201ccannon\u201d stoves, even brick-built \nRussian stoves working on heat-conservation principles \u2013 were quite well adapted \nto space heating for households and public spaces alike, though too costly for \nmost consumers (Peirce, 1951).  But they were not very useful for anything else.  \nAs early as the 1760s, stove makers had introduced a small oven into a box stove, \nturning it from a 6-plate into a 10-plate; but these ovens were too small for most \npurposes, and there were many basic cooking operations that a 10-plate stove \ncould not perform at all (notably baking and roasting).  Before stoves could \nbecome a mass-market product, and ordinary northern American households \ncould get used to efficient fuel use and a new ability to achieve and sustain winter \ntemperatures into the 70s more than a few feet from the hearth, they had to be \ntransformed into effective, versatile cooking devices (Brewer, 2000; Keep, 1916; \nStrasser, 1982, Chs. 2-3).   \nAs stoves of all kinds became cheaper, and households more prosperous,  \nconsumers could afford to buy more specialized appliances too \u2013 parlour stoves, \nfurnaces \u2013 which only provided space heating (see Figure 2).  But the key to \nbuilding the industry a mass market was cracking the problem of cooking, not \n 19 \nheating (see Figure 3).  Until this was achieved, households could not abandon the \nopen hearth and, if they were relatively prosperous, the brick bake-oven alongside \nit, and the stove revolution (and thus the transformation of the indoor climate) \ncould not take place. \n \nFigure 3: The Heart of the Home \u2013 The Classic Kitchen Stove (Walker, \n1861). \nPhilo P. Stewart (1798-1868) was one of the leading cook-stove inventors, \nperfecting a high-quality, versatile, economical appliance.  His name turned into a \nbrand, inspiring consumer confidence, in his lifetime. \n \n \n \n 20 \nAfter the solution of the problems involved in burning anthracite in the 1820s and \nearly 1830s, cooking, not heating stoves absorbed the lion's share of inventors' \nand entrepreneurs' attention.  There is no good data on the division of the stove \nindustry's output between cooking and heating appliances before the late \nnineteenth century, but there are serviceable proxies.  Between 1836 and 1873, \nthere were only about half as many invention patents for heating stoves, and one \nthird as many for hot-air furnaces, as there were for cooking stoves and their key \nfeatures (Source Translation and Optimization, 1995, Class 126).  Designers \nconcentrated on solving a number of interrelated problems, notably increasing the \nsize of the oven and equalizing heat-distribution within it, extending the usable \ncooking surface, improving fuel economy and the control of combustion, and \nutilizing what would otherwise have been waste heat to provide abundant hot \nwater (Gobeille, 1885).  The resulting appliances became the industry's market \nleaders.  In 1875, 60 percent of all the different stove models manufactured in \nAlbany and Troy, the industry's focus, were cookstoves, with the rest for heating \nor specialized uses (e.g. tailor or laundry stoves, basically modified cookstoves), \ndata consistent with the patent record (Anon., 1875).  \nThe cooking stove types which were perfected by the early 1850s enabled \nthe stove revolution to happen.  They were singularly well adapted to ordinary \nAmericans\u201f, especially rural Americans\u201f, lifestyles.  They saved on construction \ncosts and time, requiring only a sheet-iron stovepipe, not necessarily a brick or \nstone chimney.  They were comparatively light (100 kilogrammes or even less) \nand portable, and could thus move house with America\u201fs exceedingly mobile \npopulation \u2013 they could even join overland wagon trains.  More frequently they \nmade a seasonal migration from indoors to a \u201esummer kitchen\u201f (a lean-to \nproviding shelter from sun and rain, but open to the air), saving housewives from \nthe intolerable indoor temperatures otherwise unavoidable.  And they had a \nwinning combination of high thermal efficiency and great heat output, enabling \nwintertime survival in the temporary shacks and tents common in the early phases \nof settlement out on the prairies and Great Plains where fuelwood supply could be \nproblematic, or in the California gold diggings.  All told, American consumers \nand this distinctively American product were ideally matched with one another. \n 21 \n \n5. The Market Grows an Industry, and the Industry Grows Its Market \nBetween the 1810s and the late 1830s, while the demand for stoves certainly \ngrew, and the product experienced significant development, the production system \nremained stubbornly unchanged.  Stove plates continued to be cast at rural \nfurnaces, mostly in Eastern Pennsylvania and Southern New Jersey but also at \nother locations scattered across the North \u2013 even across the Appalachian \nMountains into the Ohio River valley.  Some were assembled and finished where \nthey were made, to satisfy local demand; others (in the main producing areas, \nmost) were sent to urban stove dealers \u2013 a few tens of miles away by river and \ncanal, or hundreds of miles by coastal shipping.  The plates were put together in \nthe dealers\u201f \u201cmanufactories,\u201d additional ironwork was made and fixed, and then \nthe stoves were sold \u2013 either directly to neighbouring consumers, or indirectly, \nwholesaled to smaller hardware and tinware dealers nearby, some of whom began \nto specialize in stove retailing, installation, and repair. \nBetween the late 1830s and the 1840s this decentralized system of \nproduction and distribution was revolutionized.  Some of the larger urban dealers \nand \u201cmanufacturers,\u201d who had already begun to take control of the design process, \ncommissioning castings from furnaces rather than simply contracting for \ndeliveries of whatever styles the furnace produced, brought the entire process of \ndesigning, casting, assembling, finishing, and then wholesaling, onto a single site \nand under unified ownership and control.  In the process, stoves turned from being \na major product of the iron furnace industry into the sole product of specialized, \nintegrated, and, for the time, large firms, concentrated in New York and \nPhiladelphia, Boston and Baltimore, and particularly in Albany and Troy, New \nYork \u2013 at the head of tidal navigation on the Hudson River, and the eastern \nterminus of the Erie Canal, the first great highway to the inland markets of the \nemerging Midwest.  The growing market for stoves themselves had given birth to \nan industry dedicated to making them \u2013 and making them better, lighter, cheaper, \nand more generally available than ever before  (Meyer, 2006, esp. pp. 131-5).  \nCasting quality and technique improved with the movement of production from \nthe rural furnace to the specialized urban foundry, so that the resulting products \n 22 \nwere both more serviceable as utilitarian objects (more durable, and with better-\nfitting parts resulting in greater fuel economy through draught control) and more \nattractive as household furniture (less crude, more elaborately decorated). \n \nFigure 4:  \nInventive Activity in Heating and Cooking Appliances, 1820-1875 \n(Paratext\u2122) \n \n \n \nWe have no detailed quantitative data on this period of growth and \ntransformation, apart from the evidence of the U.S. patent record.  And this is \nquite striking (see Figure 4).  There had been a trickle of patents for heating and \ncooking apparatus before the 1820s, but hardly any of them are known to have \nbeen turned into saleable products, and none of them made much impact on \nstoves\u201f subsequent development.  From the late 1820s through the late 1830s, \nhowever -- until the Panic of 1837 interrupted the industry\u201fs growth \u2013 there was a \nsustained surge, until this category of products made up one-ninth of the entire \nvolume of inventive activity recorded by the U.S. Patent Office.  The Panic killed \nthe demand for stoves and the supply of new ideas, but when the economy \nboomed again in the next decade, and the rate of increase in stove production \n0 \n100 \n200 \n300 \n400 \n500 \n600 \n1820 1825 1830 1835 1840 1845 1850 1855 1860 1865 1870 1875 \n0.0% \n2.5% \n5.0% \n7.5% \n10.0% \n12.5% \n15.0% \n17.5% \n20.0% \nInventions Designs Stove%All (RH axis) \n 23 \nprobably reached its all-time maximum (see Figure 1), stove patents once again \npeaked at nearly one-sixth of the U.S. total, counting patents for inventions and \ndesigns together. \nThis prodigious effort is evidence of the way in which a rapidly growing \nindustry attracted entrepreneurial and other creative talents to satisfy some of the \nmost basic needs of all American households by producing the foundation patents \nfor generations of economical and efficient coal and wood-fired cooking and \nheating stoves and heating furnaces \u2013 modified and developed much further over \nsubsequent decades, but not fundamentally transformed.   In the 1850s the last \ngreat breakthrough was made \u2013 the development of the \u201cbase-burning\u201d principle, \nresulting in a workable gravity-feed coal stove which enabled users to maintain a \ncontinuous fire, night and day, right through the winter season, fuel-efficiently \nand with far less labour than hitherto (Littlefield, 1859). \nSo, even before the Civil War, winter had been conquered, inside the \nhome at least, with almost all northern households, urban and rural, enjoying a \nwarm kitchen around a versatile cooking stove which also provided them with \nunprecedented amounts of cheap, easy hot water \u2013 another ingredient of the \nrevolution in domestic comfort.  For slightly wealthier consumers, parlour heating \n                                                 \n  Among the most significant early inventors were: the Reverend Dr Eliphalet \nNott, president of both Union College, Schenectady and Rensselaer Polytechnic \nInstitute, Troy, who made a series of breakthroughs in the design of stoves to burn \nanthracite, and went into business to manufacture them; Jordan Mott, a New York \nCity fuel dealer, who both designed anthracite stoves and transformed the way \nthey were made, turning them into mass-market products; Philo Stewart, a self-\ntaught mechanic and social reformer, who developed an unusually economical \nwood-burning cook stove in Ohio and New York the 1830s, and perfected it in \nTroy over the next three decades (see Figure 3); Darius Buck, an itinerant \nmechanic and stove salesman from upstate New York, who also invented (or \nreinvented) a cooking stove which solved the problems of providing a large \nenough oven for all family needs, equalizing the temperature within it, eliminating \nhot spots near the fire, and making it controllable, by putting the oven beneath the \nfire and heating it by an arrangement of downdraft flues with dampers; and \nGardner Chilson (see Figure 2), a Massachusetts pattern-maker turned stove \nmaker who specialized in solving problems of space-heating rather than cooking.  \nInterested readers can examine some of these men\u201fs key patents for themselves, \nmost conveniently via Google Patents, http:\/\/www.google.com\/patents -- simple \nword searches (e.g. Nott Stove) will produce good results. \n \n 24 \nstoves opened up more usable space within the home; and for the middle class, \nurban and rural, basement furnaces enabled them to warm the whole house, \ntransforming the way they lived within it as a result of this first affordable \napproximation to what would later come to be known as \u201ccentral heating.\u201d \n* * * \nHow are we to explain these two interrelated developments \u2013 the profit-seeking \ncreative energy that poured into satisfying what was already a rapidly-growing \nmarket for stoves in the late 1820s, taking the crude and limited devices it found \nand radically improving their usefulness; and then the entrepreneurial \ninventiveness of the late 1830s-early 1840s, which transformed the way stoves \nwere made and sold, as well as continuing the process of product development?   \nGiven that this article has taken William Meyer to task for offering what is \nessentially a single-factor explanation for what was evidently a complex and \nprotracted process, it would hardly be appropriate to offer an alternative magic \nbullet in place of the \u201chigh fuelwood price\u201d argument.  But it is tempting.  \nUnderpinning the growth of the market for stoves, the response from inventors \nand other entrepreneurs, and the consequent reorganization of the industry, was \nwhat U.S. economic historians call the \u201cTransportation Revolution\u201d (Taylor, \n1951).  The market for stoves into the early 1820s was effectively limited to those \nregions not too far away from the sea or a navigable river.  Early cooking stoves \nmight weigh as much as 500 pounds (c. 230 kilogrammes); transporting them over \nunimproved dirt roads or even hard-surfaced turnpikes by horse- or ox-drawn \nwagon was costly, difficult, and slow.  And then the Erie Canal was opened, \nproviding the first efficient highway through a gap in the mountain barrier \nseparating the East Coast from the vast, rapidly-developing rural hinterland \naround the southern shores of the Great Lakes and into the Ohio River valley.  \nThe cost of freight transportation from the Hudson River to Lake Erie fell by 90 \npercent almost overnight, and the time was halved.  (See Figure 5 for a graphic \nillustration of the immediate impact of the canal\u201fs opening on the number of \nshipping movements through Buffalo, the biggest lake port, near its western \nterminus.)  Other canals and then railways followed, cost and time continued to \n 25 \ndecline while speed and reliability improved, and the whole of the North was \nknitted together into a single market area.   \n \nFigure 5:  \nThe Opening of the North-Western Market: The Port of Buffalo, 1820-1842 \n(Walker, 1842, pp. 12-13) \n \n0\n1,000\n2,000\n3,000\n4,000\n5,000\n6,000\n1820 1822 1824 1826 1828 1830 1832 1834 1836 1838 1840\nCanal Boat Clearances \nLake Shipping Movements\n \n \nThis is what allowed stove-making to migrate from rural furnaces to urban \nfoundries \u2013 the ability to transport pig iron, coal, and other raw materials cheaply, \nand concentrate production in centres of skilled labour supply, existing demand, \nand good communications links with new markets.  Competition in and for these \nmarkets gave stove foundries\u201f owners a powerful incentive to learn, by \nexperiment, imitation, and experience, how to produce better, cheaper stoves, on a \nfar larger scale, and to develop a range of products suited to the cooking, heating, \nand other needs of households and institutional users big and small, rich and poor, \nurban and rural, wood- or coal-burning.  At the other end of the distribution chain \ncheap, rapid postal and express freight services helped give new stove consumers \nthe confidence to entrust the basic survival needs of heating and cooking to a new \ntechnology, by enabling the local dealers on whom they depended for installation \nand after-sales service to order up spare parts quickly and reliably.  The number of \nthose local retailers and thus the density of the supply and service network also \n 26 \nincreased markedly, so that by mid-century a midwestern village with a few \nhundred people might have more stove stores than an East Coast city with tens of \nthousands a generation earlier, providing even the rural consumer with choice \n(Harris, 2008\/9).  Without a sustained, multi-layered improvement in the means \nfor transporting information and goods around the country, the rapid development \nof a nationwide stove market between the 1830s and 1850s could not have taken \nplace, and no general transformation of the American indoor climate would have \noccurred.   \n \n6. Conclusions \nSo it turns out that there is a good explanation for how the stove revolution, and \nits associated transformation of the indoor winter climate across the northern \nUnited States, occurred, between the 1820s and the 1850s: the interaction between \nan already-existing demand for greater comfort (or less discomfort) and more \nconvenience in everyday life, on the one hand, and the complex market forces \ndetermining the effective supply of improved ways of using heat in household and \ninstitutional settings, on the other.  It is not that the rising cost of fuelwood was \nunimportant in explaining the transformation, but that other market and non-\nmarket forces mattered at least as much. \nWhat lessons does this chapter of history have for us nowadays, if any?  \nPerhaps the most important is that we should understand that this revolution in \nconsumer behaviour and expectations \u2013 for one certainly occurred \u2013 depended on \nthe development of a technology which was superior in many respects, not just \nlifetime price, to that which it displaced.  It could be integrated into people\u201fs \nexisting homes and ways of life with little disruption, except of the sentimental \nbonds between Americans and visible, open flame as the traditional symbol of \ncomfort and welcome  (Hawthorne, 1851).  Its deployment and refinement \ndepended, more than anything else, on an efficient market economy of \ncompetitive enterprise which created from small beginnings a product range, a \nproduction system, and a distribution and service network, within about a \ngeneration.  The difficult task of building a universal market for energy-efficient \nsubstitutes for carbon-intensive heating systems will certainly require nothing \n 27 \nless.  A market of sorts exists already; but in terms of price, performance \nadvantage, scale of production, ease of installation, and availability of reliable \nafter-sales service, we seem to be at about the same developmental stage the \nAmerican stove industry had reached by the early 1830s.  The breakthrough from \na niche to a mass-market product remains to be made.  Perhaps all that is needed \nto effect it is a sustained increase in energy prices.  But, if this critique of William \nMeyer\u201fs argument has any validity, probably not.  A transformation of the supply \nside of the industry will be equally essential. \n 28 \nReferences \n\u201eBurr-Oak\u201f [pseud.] (1850). Review of The Horticulturist for November.
