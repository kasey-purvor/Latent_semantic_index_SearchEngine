Introduction\nThe need for coatings to protect hot section parts of gas turbines has evolved progressively\nsince their first application on aerofoils in the early 1960\u2019s [1-3]. These early diffusion\ncoatings were used to protect high-pressure turbine aerofoils against degradation by high\ntemperature oxidation processes and hot corrosion. Since these early days, major steps\nhave been made in the protection of hot path components culminating, at present, in the\nuse of EB-PVD (electron beam physical vapour deposition) thermal barrier coatings on\naerofoils of advanced aero-gas turbines [4-6].\nThis paper reviews the current status of thermal barrier technology and looks to methods\ncapable of reducing the thermal conductivity in future generations of EB-PVD TBCs.\nMethods of heat transfer within zirconia based ceramics are discussed, focussing on the\ninfluence of the ceramic coating microstructure and ceramic composition in modifying the\ncoatings thermal conductivity.\n2. Thermal Barrier Coating Technology\nPlasma sprayed thermal barrier coatings Figure 1 have been used since the early 1950's\nand have been effective in protecting flare head and primary zone sections of combustors\nagainst the effects of hot spots within turbines, giving considerably improved component\nlives. Because of this success much attention has been directed towards the use of thermal\nbarriers on blades and vanes [4-9] but only within the last decade have they been used on\nhighly stressed turbine components within commercial gas turbine engines [4, 5]. Figure\n2 illustrates the strain tolerant columnar microstructure that is produced using electron\nbeam physical vapour deposition (EB-PVD). It is this strain tolerant microstructure that\nhas allowed TBC\u2019s to be successfully operate on highly stressed turbine components\nwithout spalling.\nIn addition to excellent strain tolerance [7, 8, 10-14], EB-PVD technologies result in an\nexcellent surface finish [10] and good erosion resistance [15,16], but this is at the expense\nof the thermal conductivity which may be twice that of the best plasma sprayed thermal\nbarrier coatings [10, 13, 17-19]. It is unfortunate that the microstructure (see Figure 2)\nwhich gives the EB-PVD thermal barrier coatings its high strain compliance and good\nerosion resistance leads to a relatively high thermal conductivity when compared to\nthermal sprayed coatings (Figure 3). Thus the challenge is to lower the thermal\nconductivity of EB-PVD TBCs to match that of plasma sprayed ceramic.\n3. The Thermal Conductivity of Zirconia Based Coatings\nIt is apparent (see Figure 3) that the thermal conductivity of zirconia based coatings\nstrongly depends on microstructural features of the coating, introduced as a result of the\nchosen method of deposition. Plasma sprayed ceramics, Figure 1, at present, offer the\nlowest thermal conductivities (0.8-1.1W\/mK) but at the expense of surface finish, strain\ntolerance and erosion resistance. EB-PVD ceramic coatings, Figure 2, have intermediate\nvalues for thermal conductivity (circa 1.5-1.9 W\/mK), between bulk yttria partially\nstabilised zirconia (YPSZ; 2.2-2.9 W\/mK) and the values reported for plasma sprayed\nceramics; but offer a high quality surface finish [10], better strain tolerance [7, 8, 10-14]\nand improved erosion resistance [15,16] over their plasma sprayed counterparts. Table 1\nsummaries the trade-off in properties between EB-PVD and plasma sprayed thermal\nbarrier coatings: the properties cited have been measured at room temperature [10,15,17].\nThe elastic modulus data presented was measured using either a laser ultrasound method\nor a resonant technique [10]. Measurements using four point bending results generally in\nlower values of modulus for plasma sprayed TBCs typically 30 GPa [6]. Research is\nunderway to understand the microstructural features that control thermal transport in\nzirconia based TBC's and thereby to reduce the thermal conductivity of EB-PVD thermal\nbarrier coatings. Some aspects of this work are discussed in this paper, however, the\ndegree of effort is much less than that currently spent on understanding the thermo-\nmechanical properties of these coatings [4, 5, 10-13, 20-25].\nTable 1 Properties of TBC\u2019s at Room Temperature\nProperty\/Characteristic EB-PVD Plasma Sprayed\nThermal Conductivity (W\/mK) 1.5-1.9 0.8-1.1\nSurface Roughness (\uf06dm) 1.0 10.0\nAdhesive Strength (MPa) 400 20-40\nYoung\u2019s Modulus (GPa) 90 200 [7-30]*\nErosion Rate (Normalised to PVD) 1 7\n* Measured by four-point bending\nAlperine and coworkers [13] in their recent review cited thermal conductivity\nmeasurements of zirconia TBC's from seven independent studies. Both air plasma\nsprayed (APS) and EB-PVD ceramics were examined. They concluded that the thermal\nconductivities for zirconia based coatings were significantly lower than bulk zirconia, the\nlatter having values between 2.2 and 4.0 W\/mK depending on the polymorph of the\nzirconia ceramic present. This can be seen from Figure 4, which plots the thermal\nconductivity data for zirconia ceramics and coatings as a function of the yttria content in\nthe ceramic [the data are those cited in references 10, 13, 17, 18, 20, 26-35, or measured\nindependently at Rolls Royce].\nThe observed differences in thermal conductivities reported in the above studies can be\nexplained by the microstructures developed within the coatings, as apparent in Figures 1\nand 2. The plasma sprayed TBC's (Figure 1) exhibit a two dimensional microcrack\nnetwork; one oriented parallel to the coating surface and corresponding to poor contact\nbetween different splats; the second oriented perpendicular to the coating, which results\nfrom the microcracking of splats during cooling. It is the parallel oriented cracks which\nare particularly effective in reducing the thermal conductivity in the APS coating as the\ninterfaces formed by such cracks are also perpendicular to the primary heat flux. In\naddition, dispersed spheroidal micro-porosity also lowers the conductivity of the zirconia\nceramic. For the EB-PVD case, see Figure 2, the reduction in thermal conductivity\nreflects different microstructural features. It is the intra-columnar fine porosity that\naccounts for the reduced thermal conductivity over that of the bulk ceramic. This is\ngenerally perceived to be much less effective as its distribution is generally aligned\nperpendicular to the coating surface, i.e. parallel to the direction of the primary heat flux.\nFrom a comparison of these two basic microstructures, it is clear that microstructural\nfeatures are important in controlling the thermal conductivity of zirconia thermal barrier\ncoatings, particularly the beneficial effects that could be introduced through the inclusion\nof planar scattering centres (layered structures) such as those that result naturally through\nthe plasma spray manufacturing processes.\nAs well as microstructural features, the thermal conductivity would also be expected to\nvary with the ceramic composition. This has already been demonstrated in Figure 4,\nwhere the change in thermal conductivity of zirconia ceramics and coatings, is plotted\nagainst yttria content. In each case, the thermal conductivity decreased as the yttria content\nincreased, with the highest conductivities measured for the bulk ceramic and the lowest\nfor the air plasma sprayed coatings.\n3.1 Theory of Thermal Conduction in Zirconia Ceramics\nIn crystalline solids heat is transferred by three mechanisms, (i) electrons (ii) lattice\nvibrations and (iii) radiation [35, 36]. As zirconia and its alloys are electronic insulators\n(electrical conductivity occurring at high temperatures by oxygen ion diffusion), electrons\nplay no part in the total thermal conductivity of the system and thus conduction in zirconia\nis by lattice vibrations (phonons) or by radiation (photons).\nThe contribution to thermal conductivity from lattice vibration (kp), the quanta of which\nare known as phonons, is given by [35,36]:\nkp =\n3\n1 \uf0f2 \uf06e\uf072 pv lC [1]\nwhere Cv is the specific heat, \uf072 the density, \uf06e the phonon velocity and lp the mean free\npath for scattering of phonons.\nAs an example, consider the data plotted in Figure 4, one may conclude that increasing\nthe yttria content decreases the thermal conductivity. Thus, yttria must shorten the\nintrinsic mean free path in zirconia by increasing phonon dispersion. This is most\nprobably due to the combined effect of alloying, local strain fields and the introduction of\nvacancies into the lattice, and will be discussed further later in this section.\nAs well as phonon conductivity, zirconia is susceptible to radiation conduction (photon\ntransport) at high-temperatures. Partially stabilised zirconia commonly used for TBC's,\nbecomes significantly transparent to thermal radiation at wavelengths between 0.3\uf06dm and\n5\uf06dm, as illustrated in Figure 5. At 1250\uf0b0C, 90% of the incident radiation lies in the range\n0.3-2.8\uf06dm with some 10% of the heat flux through the zirconia due to radiation [17]. This\ncontribution due to radiation can be written as [37]:\nkr =\n3\n16 \uf073n2T3lr [2]\nwhere kr is the thermal conductivity due to radiation, \uf073 is the Stephen-Boltzmann\u2019s\nconstant, n is the refractive index, T is the absolute temperature, and lr the mean free path\nfor photon scattering.\nThe total theoretical thermal conductivity of zirconia-based systems is the sum of these\ntwo terms:\nk = kp + kr [3]\nAt temperatures below 1200\uf0b0C, phonon transport dominates the heat conduction through\nzirconia. However, as the temperature is increased radiation becomes more significant (a\n10% contribution at 1250\uf0b0C) and thus is expected to be a significant factor in the\nperformance of future, high powered, high efficiency engines. Higher powers and\nimproved efficiencies are achieved by raising the turbine entry temperatures (TET) which\nwould result in a higher fraction of heat conducted through the EB-PVD TBC due to\nphoton transport (radiation). One may expect radiation to be attenuated within the TBC\nand this would act to reduce the radiation contribution to total conductivity. The splat\nboundaries of APS-TBC's are particularly effective in this context, as these boundaries are\nperpendicular to the primary heat flux [33]. Even so as the operating temperature\nincreases the contribution to thermal conductivity from radiation becomes increasingly\nimportant.\n4. Methods to Reduce the Thermal Conductivity of EB-PVD Thermal Barrier\nCoatings\nTo lower the intrinsic thermal conductivity of a material, reductions in the specific heat\ncapacity, phonon velocity, mean free path, density or refractive index are needed (equ. 1\nand 2). The specific heat capacity at constant volume (Cv) for any system is constant at a\nvalue of 3.kbN \uf0bb 25 J\/(K.mol) [38] when above the Debye temperature (380K for zirconia\n[38]). Therefore to engineer a lower thermal conductivity in zirconia-based ceramics, the\nonly options are to lower the mean free paths of the heat carriers, to lower the velocity of\nthe heat carriers, or to lower the density of the material.\nIn real crystal structures scattering of phonons occurs when they interact with lattice\nimperfections in the ideal lattice. Such imperfections include vacancies, dislocations, grain\nboundaries, atoms of different masses and other phonons. Ions and atoms of differing\nionic radius may also scatter phonons by locally distorting the bond length and thus\nintroducing elastic strain fields into the lattice. The effects such imperfections cause can\nbe quantified through their influence on the phonon mean free path (lp). This approach\nhas been used by several workers, for which the phonon mean free path is defined by:\npl\n1 =\nil\n1 +\nvacl\n1 +\ngbl\n1 +\nstrainl\n1 [4]\nwhere lI, lvac, lgb and lstrain are the contributions to the mean free path due to interstitials,\nvacancies, grain boundaries and lattice strain respectively.\nOf these the grain boundary term has the least effect on the phonon mean free path in\nconventional materials, but may provide a significant effect in nanostructured coatings\n[18,39] , whilst the intrinsic lattice structure and strain fields have a significant effect in\nboth conventional materials and coated structures. Figure 4 demonstrates that the thermal\nconductivity of zirconia ceramics can be reduced by alloying addition, irrespective of the\ngross microstructure. Microstructural effects are also important as can be seen by\ncomparing the data for bulk zirconia-yttria, with that for the EB-PVD (columnar\nmicrostructure) and plasma sprayed (lamellar microstructure) thermal barrier coatings.\nThe reduction in thermal conductivity with yttria addition, illustrated in Figure 4, is\ncommensurate with a shorter intrinsic mean free path with increasing yttria additions due\nto local modifications to the lattice structure, introduction of vacancies and local strain\nfields generated by incorporating large dopant atoms. These strain fields and vacancies act\nto scatter phonons directly increasing phonon dispersion in the lattice. With increased\ndispersion, there is a high probability that phonon-phonon interactions will occur whereby\nthe mean free path will be further reduced.\n4.1. Reduction of the Thermal Conductivity for EB-PVD TBC's by the Addition\nof Dopants (Colouring)\nTamarin and co-workers [40] examined the addition of divalent transition metal oxides to\nreduce the thermal conductivity of zirconia-yttria TBC's and reported reductions of 30-\n40%. Such dopant additions give rise to two effects; firstly to reduce the phonon\ntransport in the material and secondly to reduce the radiative transport mechanism. The\nuse of a divalent transition metal oxide will introduce vacancies as well as strain centres\ninto the lattice, both of which will reduce the phonon mean free path as discussed above.\nIn addition, this doping changes the colour of the TBC material to dark green\/grey,\nreducing radiation transport in the visible range, and by inference in the near infra-red.\nFollowing this concept, but concentrating on the role of high mass additions, which\ntheoretically will provide more effective scattering centres [35], a number of alternative\ndopant additions have been examined with the aim of further reducing the phonon thermal\nconductivity. Five dopant additions have been examined; Erbia, Nickel oxide, Neodymia,\nGadolinia and Ytterbia, with the aim of maximising lattice strains and lattice\nanharmonicity [41]. The ternary additions were introduced by custom manufacturing\nevaporation rods with known dopant levels, 2.0, 4.0 and 8.0 mole %. All rods evaporated\nwell, resulting in coating thicknesses between 120-400\uf06dm. The thermal conductivity of\neach doped TBC was measured. The data are presented in Figures 6 and 7. Figure 6\ndemonstrates the benefits of Erbia and Neodymia additions, at various mole fractions,\nwhere it can be seen that up to 8 mole % results in a significant drop in thermal\nconductivity for both additions, with Neodymia more effective. For example, an 8%\nErbia addition lowered the thermal conductivity (measured at 500\uf0b0C) by 32% and\ncoloured the ceramic pink, while Neodymia at 8 mole % lowering the thermal\nconductivity (measured at 500\uf0b0C) by 46% and coloured the ceramic blue; achieving\ncomparable thermal conductivities to plasma sprayed TBC's for an EB-PVD ceramic.\nFigure 7 compares the performance of various additions at 4 mole %. As can be seen from\nFigure 7, the most effective additions examined to date were Gadolinia, Neodymia and\nYtterbia, which resulted in a thermal conductivity of 0.88, 1.00 and 1.02 W\/mK,\ncalculated for a 4 mole % addition at a coating thickness of 250\uf06dm, when measured at\n500\uf0b0C\nIn this study, the addition of divalent metal ions, as suggested by Tamerin et al [40] was\nmuch less beneficial. The addition of 4 mole % NiO, which coloured the ceramic dark\ngreen\/grey, only reduced the thermal conductivity of an EB-PVD TBC by some 3%, for a\n250\uf06dm thick coating, measured at 500\uf0b0C.\n4.2 Reduction of Thermal Conductivity by Varying the Coating Nano-structure\nAlthough for conventional materials, the grain boundary contribution to phonon scattering\nis thought to be small it has been shown [18,39] that within thermal barrier coatings (both\nplasma sprayed and EB-PVD) grain boundaries can have a significant effect, particularly\nwhen the grain size is of the same order as the mean free path for phonon scattering.\nFigure 8 presents a calculation by Kabacoff [39] of the influence of nano-grain size on the\nphonon conductivity of zirconia-7wt% ytrria as a function of temperature. This\ndemonstrates that the thermal conductivity is drastically reduced for fine grained\nmaterials, particularly when the grain size is of nanometer dimensions. For a 5nm grain\nsize a value of 0.7 Wm-1K-1 is predicted, virtually independent of temperature, for\ntemperature above 200\uf0b0C.\nFor EB-PVD thermal barrier coatings, the thermal conductivity has been observed to vary\nwith coating thickness [18]. For the early stages of deposition (<100\uf06dm) a value of 0.8-\n1.0 Wm-1K-1 has been reported, however, by the time the coating is 250\uf06dm thick, the mean\nthermal conductivity is between 1.5-1.9 Wm-1K-1, when measured at room temperature.\nThis behaviour has been modelled by using a two layer coating approximation consisting\nof an inner (100\uf06dm) fine-structured zone, overcoated with a layer with thermal\nconductivity close to bulk zirconia (2.2 Wm-1K-1). The two layer model provides a close\napproximation to the thermal conductivity of variable thickness EB-PVD thermal barrier\ncoatings. Measurements of the inner, fine-structured grain size gives value of 3-4 \uf06dm,\nalthough within each grain is a ultrafine fibrous structure of nanometer dimensions.\n4.3. Reduction of the Thermal Conductivity for EB-PVD TBC's by Layering\nThe foregoing discussion would suggest that to reduce the thermal conductivity of EB-\nPVD TBC's further one should introduce additional phonon scattering centres into the\ncoating. Further, from equation 2, reducing the mean free path from 250\uf06dm (of the order\nof the thickness of the coating) to 1-2\uf06dm would cause a reduction in the radiation\ncontribution to the total thermal conductivity from 1 to 0.005 W\/mK [17]. Thus, layering\nof the ceramic offers a most promising route to lower the thermal conductivity of an EB-\nPVD TBC, by modifying both the phonon and photon transport within the coatings.\nFor photon scattering, the periodicity of the layers should be chosen to act as a quarter\nwavelength filter (between \uf06c and \uf06c\/4 of the incident radiation). With radiation\nwavelengths between 0.3-5.0\uf06dm, the layer periodicity should lie between 0.2-2.0\uf06dm,\ncentred around 0.7\uf06dm. This concept of layering within each column of an EB-PVD\ncoating is illustrated schematically in Figure 9; the principle being to introduce interfaces\ninto each column structure which are essentially parallel to the ceramic\/bondcoat interface,\nbut without disrupting the columnar structure that provides the EB-PVD coating with\ngood strain tolerance and erosion resistance. This concept is the subject of a European\npatent [42].\nThe method of obtaining such structures in practice uses a glow discharge plasma to vary\nthe density of the ceramic during deposition. Figure 10 illustrates a typical micrograph of\nthe morphological changes that can be introduced [19]. The layers were produced by\nswitching the D.C. bias applied to the substrate between high and low levels during\ndeposition. This has the effect of periodically changing the degree of ion bombardment\nand thus altering the density of the layers produced. The micrograph illustrated in Figure\n10 was produced by switching between a D.C. bias with a peak voltage of -2500V and\nground. The degree of bombardment that is attained depends on the applied bias and\nlocal current density; current densities typically greater than 0.1mA\/cm2 are required to\nachieve a significant density change [17,42].\nThe measured thermal conductivity for this microstructure is significantly lower than that\nfor a coating produced without ion bombardments (Figure 11). Reductions of the order of\n37-45% compared to state-of-the-art EB-PVD TBC's have been measured for these\nlayered structures, approaching the values for thermally sprayed TBC systems. Clearly,\nthe combination of layering at micron dimensions and the introduction of density change\nfrom layer to layer work in combination to reduce the thermal conduction of the coating.\nThe layering periodicity is selected to significantly reduce photon transport, while local\nchanges in layer density act to scatter phonons and thus reduce thermal conduction by\nlattice vibration as well.\n5. Conclusions\nIn this paper. Methods capable of lowering the thermal conductivity of EB-PVD thermal\nbarrier coatings have been reviewed. Four significant factors have been identified that\nmay lower the coating thermal conductivity by modifying either phonon and\/or photon\ntransport.\nThese factors are:-\n1) The introduction of atomic level defects, such defects include atoms of differing\nmass, vacancies and interstitials and can be introduced by adding dopant, or by ion\nbombardment. These defects are effective in reducing phonon conduction (heat\ntransfer by lattice vibrations).\n2) Colouring of the thermal barrier coatings can be used to increase the coatings\nopaqueness to infra-red radiation. This is achieved through the addition of dopant\nmaterials and reduces the radiative transport through the coating.\n3) Nano-grained structures act to scatter both phonons and photons. The fine,\nmicro-crystallite zone observed within the nucleation region of EB-PVD thermal\nbarrier coatings behaves in this way. Re-nucleation of the EB-PVD coating\ngrowth at periodicities less than 100\uf06dm would lower the ceramic coatings thermal\nconductivity.\n4) Layering involves the introduction of interfaces\/density changes parallel to the\nceramic bond coat interface. These layered structures are effective in reducing\nboth radiative and phonon transport.\nThis paper has shown that a 4 mole % addition of a tertiary dopant will reduce the thermal\nconductivity of zirconia-7wt% yttria (4 mole %). Ytterbia, Neodymia and Gadolinia have\nbeen shown to be particularly effective, achieving thermal conductivities of 0.88 and 1.02\nWm-1K-1 (calculated for a 250\uf06dm coating at 500\uf0b0C).\nBy layering, thermal conductivities of 0.9-1.1 Wm-1K-1 are possible for a 250\uf06dm EB-PVD\nzirconia-7wt% yttria TBC.\nIn combination, colouring plus layering, one should expect a significant further reduction\nin thermal conductivity; possibly achieving a value of 0.5 Wm-1K-1 for a 250\uf06dm EB-PVD\nTBC. Colouring plus layering is planned in a future extension of this research.\n6.
