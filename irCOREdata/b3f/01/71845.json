The fourth section of the paper uses this account to \nshed light on the circumstances in which thought experiments fail. \n  \nKeywords: Thought experiment, Thomas Kuhn, John Norton, James Brown. \n  \nThis paper seeks to provide an account of how thought experiments work, and of how they can go \nwrong. Philosophers should be interested in this project for two reasons. First, philosophers often use \nthought experiments, especially in ethics and the philosophy of mind, and an understanding of how \nthought experiments work might enable philosophers to use them more successfully. Second, \nthought experiments are epistemically interesting in their own right. In a thought experiment it seems \nwe can start from a position of ignorance, sit and think, and gain new knowledge, despite the input of \nno new empirical data. One aim of this paper is to explain the origin of this new knowledge.  \nThe paper is split into four sections. The first argues that thought experiments in philosophy \nand science can be treated together. The second examines existing accounts of thought experiments \nPage 1 of 25Thought Experiments\n08\/01\/2008http:\/\/eprints.lancs.ac.uk\/263\/1\/Thought_Experimentsjm2.htm\nand shows why they are inadequate. The third proposes a better account of thought \nexperiments. The fourth uses this account to shed light on the circumstances in which thought \nexperiments fail. \nBefore the philosophical work, it will be useful to clarify what I mean by \u201cthought \nexperiment\u201d. For the purposes of this paper I shall adapt a definition offered by Tamar Szab\u00f3 \nGendler and take it that to conduct a thought experiment is to make a judgement about what would \nbe the case if the particular state of affairs described in some imaginary scenario were actual \n(Gendler, 1998, 398).  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n1.Thought experiments in science and philosophy \n  \nPhilosophers writing on thought experiments divide between those who restrict their attention to \nthought experiments in science, and those who consider thought experiments in both philosophy and \nin science together.\n[1]\n Those who only consider thought experiments in science have not given \narguments for thinking that thought experiments in science are necessarily different. Their restriction \nseems to result from a strategy of caution \u2013 these authors are not sure whether thought experiments \nare similar in philosophy and science, and so just talk about areas where they are convinced their \naccount works. In this paper I throw caution to the wind, and concern myself with thought \nexperiments in all areas.  There are two reasons why I think this is the best way to proceed. First, on \ngrounds of simplicity, if it is possible to produce a unified account of thought experimentation this \nshould be preferred. And, the only way to find out whether there is an acceptable unified account is \nto try and construct one. This is what I attempt in this paper.  \nSecond, there are reasons to be sceptical of the idea that science and philosophy are radically \ndistinct enterprises. The work of empirically-inclined philosophers of mind and language is often \nindistinguishable from work in theoretical psychology or linguistics.  The same holds for \nphilosophers of physics and theoretical physicists, and for game theorists, economists, and \nPage 2 of 25Thought Experiments\n08\/01\/2008http:\/\/eprints.lancs.ac.uk\/263\/1\/Thought_Experimentsjm2.htm\ntheoretical evolutionary biologists. In many cases, philosophical and scientific pieces of work \ncan only be distinguished on the basis of the journals in which they are published. Moreover, \nbecause of its necessarily non-empirical nature, work involving thought experiments is particularly \nlikely to fall on the border between philosophy and science. Articles on the E. P.R experiment, \nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat, or bilking experiments (thought experiments showing that causal paradoxes would \nemerge if one could go back in time and kill one\u2019s father), are as likely to be found in the Physical \nReview as the Philosophical Review. Newcombe\u2019s paradox is discussed equally by economists and \nphilosophers. Psychologists and philosophers alike worry about the Turing Test and Searle\u2019s Chinese \nRoom.  It is hard to distinguish science from philosophy, and even harder to distinguish \nphilosophical from scientific thought experiments. For this reason an account of thought \nexperimentation that can encompass all thought experiments, whether \u201cphilosophical\u201d or \n\u201cscientific\u201d, is to be preferred. \nOccasionally, it has been suggested that while we may not be able to divide thought \nexperiments into philosophical and scientific, they can be divided into distinct classes on the basis of \nthe type of question that they ask. Some thought experiments, it is said, ask what would happen in a \nhypothetical state of affairs, others ask how we would describe situations, and yet others, how we \nwould evaluate them. While I accept that thought experiments can be employed to answer different \ntypes of question, I suggest that it is a mistake to think of there being a corresponding variety of \ndifferent types of thought experiment.  This is because it is implausible to think that there are distinct \nmental processes at work in considering how things are, in describing them, and in evaluating them. \nOur imaginings are shaped by how we describe situations, and many descriptions are already value-\nladen. Thus, if I imagine a small boy setting fire to a cat, I do not first form the image, and then label \nit a case of torture, and then decide that it wouldn\u2019t be very nice of the boy. Rather I imagine a cruel \nboy torturing a cat \u2013 the description, and evaluation, are already built into the hypothetical scene. As \nwe describe, and evaluate, alongside imagining, there will not be different types of thought \nexperiment, some of which just involve imagining, and others of which involve additional activities.  \n  \n2. Existing accounts of thought experiments \n  \nIn this section I examine accounts of thought experiments have been proposed by other authors, and \nPage 3 of 25Thought Experiments\n08\/01\/2008http:\/\/eprints.lancs.ac.uk\/263\/1\/Thought_Experimentsjm2.htm\nshow why they are inadequate.  \n  \na. Kuhn\u2019s remembering account \n  \nThomas Kuhn puts forward an account of scientific thought experiments in his 1964 paper, \u201cA \nfunction for thought experiments\u201d. According to Kuhn, during periods of normal science, scientists \nsee anomalies but typically turn a blind eye to them. Usually a scientist\u2019s experiences of anomalies \nquickly fade from memory. Knowledge of anomalies is not necessarily altogether lost, however, as \ncertain techniques can be employed to bring this semi-forgotten knowledge back into consciousness. \nIn Kuhn\u2019s account, thought experiments work by providing scientists with a means of \nretrieving memories of anomalies that they have previously seen, but so far ignored. The narrative \nstructure of a thought experiment acts to trigger the memory of the scientist. As a scientist visualises \nthe scenario sketched by the thought experiment, he experiences a feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. This is because \nhe has seen the scenario before, and so when prompted by the structure of the thought experiment he \ncan work out what would happen if the imagined scenario were actual. Kuhn argues that thought \nexperiments have an important role to play in the history of science. They enable repressed \nknowledge of anomalies to come to the attention of scientists. This enables them to appreciate when \ntheir paradigm is inadequate, and can thus help normal science to enter a revolutionary phase. \nKuhn\u2019s account manages to explain how knowledge can be gained via thought experimentation. The \n\u201cnew\u201d knowledge gained in a thought experiment is remembered knowledge. As such it is not really \nnew, and the epistemic puzzle of how armchair experiments can yield knowledge is solved. \nKuhn himself accepts that his account may not apply to all thought experiments, and indeed \nthere is a large class of thought experiments for which it cannot account. According to Kuhn, a \nscientist can work out what would happen in a hypothetical situation because he has seen situations \nof the type being described in the real world. The scientist just has to remember what he has seen \npreviously. However, some thought experiments concern situations that cannot have been seen \nbefore. Consider thought experiments that involve physically impossible scenarios. Einstein running \nalong a light beam, for example, or Poincar\u00e9\u2019s Flat Land, which involves 2D people exploring a 2D \nenvironment (Poincar\u00e9, 1952, 37-8). As physically impossible situations cannot have been perceived \npreviously, Kuhn\u2019s account is incapable of coping with such thought experiments. \nPage 4 of 25Thought Experiments\n08\/01\/2008http:\/\/eprints.lancs.ac.uk\/263\/1\/Thought_Experimentsjm2.htm\nSimplicity dictates that a common account of all thought experiments should be sought if at \nall possible. For this reason, if an account can be given that encompasses physically impossible \nthought experiments along with others, this should be preferred to Kuhn\u2019s. Later in this paper I \npropose such an account. \n  \n  \nb. Norton\u2019s argument account \n  \nJohn Norton has proposed an account according to which thought experiments are really just \ndressed-up arguments (Norton 1991, 1996).\n[2]\n He aims principally to give an account of thought \nexperiments in physics, and supports his position by offering reconstructions of the formal \narguments that he thinks underlie some of Einstein\u2019s thought experiments. Norton fails to specify \nprecisely what he means by \u201cargument\u201d. However, he cannot simply mean \u201cdeductive argument\u201d, as \nhe explicitly accepts that thought experiments can use inductive as well as deductive inferences. \nNorton\u2019s general approach in showing that thought experiments are arguments is to reduce them to a \nseries of propositions. He reduces them to lists of premises and assumptions, leading to a conclusion \nvia inferences of a recognised sort. This, I shall take it, is what at minimum he means by \u201cargument\u201d. \nNorton claims that all thought experiments can be reduced to such arguments without epistemic loss. \nNorton\u2019s account should not be accepted.\n[3]\n His primary reason for thinking that thought \nexperiments are arguments is that he has shown that some of Einstein\u2019s thought experiments can be \nreplaced by arguments, but this demonstration is not sufficient to prove his claim. All Norton has \nshown is that Einstein\u2019s thought experiments lead to a conclusion that can also be reached via a \nlogical argument. This is insufficient to demonstrate that the argument and the thought experiment \nare actually identical, as the processes via which the conclusion is reached may be quite different in \nthe two cases. Indeed the phenomenology of thought experimentation suggests that this is the case. \nSimply put, constructing a thought experiment feels quite different from producing a logical \nargument. Thought experiments are often fun and easy, arguments are usually not. When we perform \na thought experiment we imagine the situation unfolding in our mind\u2019s eye. We don\u2019t consider \npremises, modes of inference, and conclusions.  \nFurthermore, in some cases, thought experiments require types of reasoning that cannot be \nPage 5 of 25Thought Experiments\n08\/01\/2008http:\/\/eprints.lancs.ac.uk\/263\/1\/Thought_Experimentsjm2.htm\nconsidered argumentative in any sense, that is that cannot be reduced to anything like a \npremises-conclusion form. Take Hume\u2019s missing shade of blue (Hume, 1978, 6). Hume asks us to \nconsider whether someone could imagine what the missing shade of blue looked like without ever \nhaving seen it. How do we perform such a thought experiment? I suggest that we do something like \nthe following: we consider something like the colour charts for shades of paint and imagine a gap, \nand then we try and imagine the missing shade. This thought experiment requires us to imagine what \nit is like to see blue, something that cannot be reduced to propositional form. Other thought \nexperiments that involve imagining qualia will similarly not be reducible to arguments, nor will \nthought experiments that require spatial reasoning, for example, one in which we see that a square \npeg cannot go through a round hole of the same diameter. Whatever thought experiments are, they\u2019re \nnot simply arguments. Thus Norton\u2019s account must be rejected. \n  \n  \nc. Brown\u2019s Platonic account. \n  \nJames Brown agrees with Norton that some thought experiments are merely dressed up reductio \narguments (Brown, 1991a., 76).  However, he agrees with me that this cannot be the full story, and \nthat some thought experiments are not arguments. To account for these, in his 1991 book, The \nLaboratory of the Mind, Brown proposes a Platonic account of thought experimentation, which he \nmodels on Platonic accounts of mathematics.\n[4]\n According to Platonic accounts of mathematics, \nmathematical knowledge can be gained via perceiving, or intuiting, a Platonic realm of numbers. \nBrown claims that the laws of nature are relations between universals, and that thought experiments \nenable us to gain new knowledge of the laws of nature by providing us with access to a Platonic \nrealm. When, for example, a physicist constructs a thought experiment concerning the behaviour of \nmasses, the physicist gains knowledge via directly perceiving the relations between Platonic \nuniversals of masses. Brown is concerned primarily with thought experiments in science, but he \nsuspects his account will work for philosophical thought experiments too. \nThere are several problems with Brown\u2019s account. First, there is no account of how the \nPlatonic universals are \u201cperceived\u201d. Brown attempts to block this objection by claiming that the \nmechanisms whereby physical objects are perceived are also poorly understood. Here he misses the \nPage 6 of 25Thought Experiments\n08\/01\/2008http:\/\/eprints.lancs.ac.uk\/263\/1\/Thought_Experimentsjm2.htm\nforce of the objection, which is derived from a causal theory of knowledge. A causal theory \nof knowledge holds that a necessary condition for knowledge is that a causal chain links us to the \nsituation we claim to know about. Once we combine a causal theory of knowledge with a claim that \ncauses must be physical, or at least spatio-temporal, we rule out the possibility of gaining knowledge \nof Platonic universals. \n[5]\n In addition, if a causal theory of reference is adopted, then a parallel \nargument shows that reference could not be made to any Platonic universals that might exist. \nThese arguments against Brown are not fully persuasive, however. Brown will almost \ncertainly argue that these causal accounts run into problems in the case of mathematics, and must \nthus be rejected. Here I think we reach an impasse. Debates over the nature of mathematical \nknowledge are too long running for there to be much hope that they will be resolved any time soon. \nIn a well-known article Paul Benacerraf (1973) has argued that all current accounts of mathematics \nare unsatisfactory. Some accounts have concentrated on providing a satisfactory account of \nmathematical truth, but run into problems when explaining how we can come to know about these \ntruths. Here Platonic accounts are the primary examples. Other accounts, such as the various forms \nof formalism, can deal with the epistemology of mathematics, but fail to provide a satisfying account \nof mathematical truth. As such, in the current state of play, Platonic accounts of mathematics appear \nunsatisfactory, but their defenders can rightly point out that they can deal with problems that other \naccounts of mathematics currently can not. In the absence of an account that is clearly better, \nPlatonic accounts of mathematics cannot be entirely ruled out.  \nThis being said, it is worth noting that a Platonic account of thought experiments requires a \nmetaphysics even more bountiful than that required by a Platonic account of mathematics. A \nPlatonic account of mathematics just requires there to be Platonic mathematical objects. Brown \nneeds a far richer Platonic realm. He needs Platonic universals corresponding to Newton\u2019s rotating \nbucket, and to the string that ties Galileo\u2019s masses together, for example. Brown might protest at this \nand claim that he needs only universals that correspond to the basic physical laws \u2013 thus there will be \nuniversals of Mass and Force and F=ma, but no Bucket or String. Granted, the thought experimenter \naccesses the realm of the Fundamental Laws of Nature through telling a story about tied masses, \nBrown might say, but once they have achieved access, they perceive Mass and Gravity, rather than \nString. This will not do, however, as it does not tie in with the phenomenology of thought \nexperimentation. Brown might claim that the phenomenology is misleading. But, if he makes this \nPage 7 of 25Thought Experiments\n08\/01\/2008http:\/\/eprints.lancs.ac.uk\/263\/1\/Thought_Experimentsjm2.htm\nmove, his account is considerably weakened. One of the advantages claimed for his account \nwas that it would explain the pseudo-visual nature of thought experimentation, and the ease and \nassurance with which conclusions can sometimes be drawn from thought experiments. If Brown \nclaims that the phenomenology misleads, then he can no longer claim these advantages for his \naccount. \nTo sum up: While there may not be anything better currently available, Platonic accounts of \nmathematics appear unpromising. Brown\u2019s account of thought experiments shares the problems of \nsuch accounts. In addition, even if it were possible to perceive universals, Brown\u2019s Platonic heaven \nwould need to be repulsively over-populated. For these reasons his account should be countenanced \nonly as a very last resort. \n  \n  \nd. Experimentalist accounts  \n  \nSome authors claim that thought experiments are literally experiments (Sorensen 1992a., Gooding \n1990, McAllister 1996). They accept that regular experimenters manipulate the world, while thought \nexperimenters manipulate thoughts, but think that this difference is insignificant compared to the \nfeatures thought experiments and real experiments have in common. For example, both real and \nthought experiments can be used to demonstrate the inadequacies of theories, both involve isolating \nfeatures of phenomenon that are of interest, and so on. \nI\u2019m not sure what to make of claims that thought experiments are literally experiments. It\u2019s \nnot as if experiments form a natural kind, such that it might be discovered that thought experiments \nare a species of the genus. Rather than being a claim like \u201cWhales are mammals\u201d, the claim that \nthought experiments are experiments seems more like \u201cBeanbags are chairs\u201d. Beanbags are like \nchairs in some respects, and someone who claims that beanbags are chairs seeks to direct our \nattention to these common features. Still, it remains the case that beanbags and chairs have important \ndifferences. Similarly, thought experiments are similar to real experiments in some ways, and not in \nothers. When shorn of its rhetorical effect, the claim that \u201cThought experiments are experiments\u201d \ncomes down to no more than the claim that studying the similarities between thought experiments \nand real experiments is enlightening.  This may well be the case. However, the fact that real \nPage 8 of 25Thought Experiments\n08\/01\/2008http:\/\/eprints.lancs.ac.uk\/263\/1\/Thought_Experimentsjm2.htm\nexperiments involve manipulations on material objects, while thought experiments do not, is \na difference between thought experiments and real experiments that cannot be ignored. Real \nexperiments can teach us about the world because they involve interacting with the world. In \ncontrast, thought experiments are problematic because the source of the knowledge gained via \nthought experiment is unclear.  Crucially, claiming that thought experiments are real experiments \ndoes not help explain the source of the knowledge gained via thought experiments.  \nWhen it comes to explaining how we can learn from thought experiments, those authors who \nclaim that thought experiments are literally experiments supplement their account in various ways. In \naddition to claiming that thought experiments are experiments, Sorensen holds that thought \nexperiments are paradoxes. They correspond to \u201ca set of individually plausible yet inconsistent \npropositions\u201d (Sorensen, 1992a., 6). In so far as a thought experiment is identified with a set of \npropositions, however, Sorensen\u2019s account will run into the same kinds of problems as Norton\u2019s \nargument-based account. There are some thought experiments that simply do not have a \npropositional form. David Gooding says that thought experiments involve the \u201cconstruction of \nexperimental narratives that enable virtual or vicarious witnessing\u201d and that \u201cthought experiments \nwork because they are distillations of practice\u201d (Gooding, 1990, 204-205). Unfortunately, Gooding \ndoesn\u2019t elaborate further, but in these comments he may be edging towards a model-based account of \nthought experimentation similar to that outlined in the next section. \n  \n  \n2. A better account of thought experimentation \n  \nIn this section I propose an account that explains thought experiments as attempts to construct \nmodels of possible worlds. Nancy Nersessian (1992) and Nenad Mi\u0161\u010devi\u0107 (1992) have also proposed \nmodel-based accounts of thought experimentation. Their accounts differ substantially from my own \nin ways that will be spelt out later. In addition, and as mentioned previously, David Gooding (1990) \nmakes some comments that suggest he holds some kind of model-based account, and Kathleen \nWilkes (1988) talks of thought experimenters imagining possible worlds.  \nCharacteristically, thought experiments present us with a series of \u201cWhat if\u201d questions. For \nexample, we may seek to discover what would happen if there were no friction, or what would \nPage 9 of 25Thought Experiments\n08\/01\/2008http:\/\/eprints.lancs.ac.uk\/263\/1\/Thought_Experiment\nhappen if people split like amoeba. In performing a thought experiment we temporarily adjust \nour world view in order to construct a model in accord with the answers to these \u201cwhat if\u201d questions. \nWhen answering the \u201cwhat if\u201d questions we predict how imaginary entities would behave in \nthe same way that we predict how real entities will behave. Sometimes we will have explicit laws \ngoverning how entities of the type we are imagining act in the types of situation we are imagining. \nThus, we can predict how fast imaginary masses would fall under gravity in the same way that we \ncan predict how fast real masses fall. We plug the relevant values into equations and calculate the \nprediction. Whether the masses are real or imaginary makes no difference. We can also employ tacit \nunderstanding of laws that we could not formally state. Sometimes the answers to the \u201cwhat if\u201d \nquestions are provided by implicit laws that are contained in the implications of the concepts we are \nemploying. For example it is part of the meaning of \u201clight\u201d that it travels at the speed of light, and \npart of the meaning of \u201cpencil\u201d that it is a writing implement. We can also employ simulation type \nreasoning. If the simulation account of out folk psychological practices is correct (as proposed by \nGordan, 1986), then this type of reasoning would be employed to predict the behaviour of imagined \npeople. \nRoy Sorensen, and before him Ernst Mach, suggest that evolution has fitted us with modal \nintuitions that can be expected to be broadly accurate, at least within commonplace domains \n(Sorensen 1992a., 1992b.; Mach 1960). The idea, loosely, is that those of our ancestors who \ncorrectly intuited how lions behave in nearby possible worlds were better able to outwit the lions and \nstay alive. Believing that lions can jump 10 ft but not 100ft, that lions are killed when large rocks fall \non them, and that if a lion catches you she\u2019ll eat you, had survival value.  Against Sorensen, James \nMaffie (1997) convincingly argues that we should expect any evolved ability to intuit modal \nproperties to be limited.  \u201cFor what difference does believing \u20182+2=4\u2019 is necessarily vs. \nnomologically vs. universally yet accidentally true make in terms of an organism\u2019s evolutionary \nfitness?\u201d (Maffie, 1997, 213). Still, this is not sufficient to rule out the possibility that we might have \nevolved reliable intuitions regarding practical possibility, and if this were so, such instincts could \nalso be used working out what would happen in hypothetical situations. \nA point of key importance to my account is that the reasoning employed in constructing \nthought experiments is of a perfectly commonplace kind. Answering the \u201cwhat if\u201d questions of a \nthought experiment uses the same kind of processes as answering \u201cwhat if\u201d questions in all other \nPage 10 of 25Thought Experiments\n08\/01\/2008http:\/\/eprints.lancs.ac.uk\/263\/1\/Thought_Experimentsjm2.htm\ncontexts. As human beings, planning, plotting, and imagining are of great importance to us. \nIf, for example, we are going to decorate a room or book a holiday we don\u2019t just go ahead and do \nthese things, but instead spend some time considering the different courses of action available to us. \nWe consider what would happen if we went on holiday to Bournemouth as compared to if we went \nto Turkey, and by comparing the anticipated consequences come to a conclusion as to which type of \na holiday we would prefer. The forms of reasoning involved in such planning are identical to those \ninvolved in thought experimentation. \nWhen a thought experimenter is faced with a \u201cwhat if\u201d question, she attempts to answer it in \na rigorous fashion. She follows though all the relevant implications of altering one part of her world \nview and attempts to construct a coherent model of the situation she is imagining. The rigour with \nwhich thought experimenters attempt to answer \u201cwhat if\u201d questions is what differentiates thought \nexperiments from daydreams and much fiction.\n[6]\n In a day dream I might lazily imagine being Prime \nMinister \u2013 there I am bossing everyone about, issuing edicts that extend university vacations, and so \non. In a thought experiment such slap-dash imaginings are not permitted. If I conduct a thought \nexperiment in which I dictate that university vacations should be extended, then I am obligated to at \nleast sketch a coherent model of the situation \u2013 the courses must be correspondingly shorter, degrees \nmust be longer, funding per a student greater, and so on. \nThe thought experimenter is committed to rigorously considering all relevant consequences \nin answering the \u201cwhat if\u201d questions. Some consequences, however, will not be relevant to the \npurpose of the thought experiment and can safely be ignored. Consider, for example, the thought \nexperiment in which Einstein considered what he would see if he ran along a light beam at the speed \nof light. Now, of course, anyone running at such speeds would be in no position to make \nobservations: long before reaching light speeds they would be too tired to notice anything, and their \nrunning shoes would burn up. Such points, however, are irrelevant to the issues at hand and so can \nbe ignored. \nWhen the thought experimenter has followed through all relevant consequences of the \u201cwhat \nif\u201d questions, several outcomes are possible. Sometimes when all the \u201cwhat if\u201d questions are \nanswered, the result is an internally consistent model. What do I mean by model? A dynamic \nrepresentation of a situation. The model might consist of a set of propositions describing a situation, \nor it might be pictorial. In my view the form of the model may well differ in different cases, and \nPage 11 of 25Thought Experiments\n08\/01\/2008http:\/\/eprints.lancs.ac.uk\/263\/1\/Thought_Experimentsjm2.htm\ndoesn\u2019t much matter. Indeed I would go so far as to claim that whether a situation is \nmodelled in thought alone, or in some more concrete medium such as plasticine, isn\u2019t all that \nimportant. Human beings have developed their capacity to think via utilising various aids \u2013 pen and \npaper, diagrams, and so on. In a sense such tools enable us to externalise thinking. In many cases the \nsame mental operations can be performed in different ways. Consider, for example, doing sums in \nmathematics. Some people can only do sums on paper. Some need to use their fingers and toes, and \ncount them all up to find the result. Other people can do maths in their heads \u2013 of these some will \nimagine what the sum would look like if written down, while others use different methods. All these \nindividuals are adding up, and it doesn\u2019t much matter what method they use.  I suggest that the \ndifferences between mental models and concrete models can be similarly insignificant. One thought \nexperimenter will be able to visualise a situation, another will use a scrawled diagram, and a third \nwill need to use concrete objects to represent the actors. All three model the situation, and the \ndifferences between them are unimportant. \nDepending on the account of possible worlds adopted, when the thought experimenter \nproduces an internally consistent model she either constructs or represents a possible world. \nAdopting a realist stance towards possible worlds commits one to providing some explanation of \nhow we come to know about these \u201cother worlds\u201d, leading to difficulties similar to those that I \nconsidered problematic for Brown\u2019s Platonist account of thought experiments. Thus, here I will \nadopt an anti-realist account of possible worlds. This is not an essential element of my account, \nhowever, and those who are willing to countenance realist accounts of possible worlds can \nconsistently also accept my account of thought experiments.  \nStrictly speaking, as the thought experimenter will not specify irrelevant details in her model, \nshe will not produce a single possible world, but rather a template for an infinite number of possible \nworlds. \u201cPossible world\u201d, in the singular, can be taken throughout as shorthand for this infinite set. If \nthe thought experimenter manages to construct an internally consistent model, and thus construct a \npossible world, then she can conclude that the situation she has imagined is possible. The strength of \nthe possibility, physical or logical, depends on whether the thought experimenter has constrained \nherself to constructing only models where the actual physical laws obtain. \nIn some cases, the thought experimenter will be forced to conclude that an internally \nconsistent model cannot be produced. Often this will be because following through the \u201cwhat if\u201d \nPage 12 of 25Thought Experiments\n08\/01\/2008http:\/\/eprints.lancs.ac.uk\/263\/1\/Thought_Experimentsjm2.htm\nquestions would result in a contradiction. In other cases, although there is no overt \ncontradiction, the thought experimenter will conclude that an internally consistent model cannot be \nproduced after numerous attempts to construct such a model have failed. In these cases different \nparts of the model simply will not go together, in a sense analogous to the sense in which the pieces \nof jumbled jigsaw puzzles cannot be made to fit together. If the thought experimenter decides that no \ninternally consistent model can be produced she will conclude that the hypothesised situation is \nimpossible. Again the strength of the impossibility depends on whether the thought experimenter has \nrestricted herself to attempting to construct models in which the actual physical laws obtain. \nMany regard inferences from \u201cIt is conceivable that X\u201d to \u201cIt is possible that X\u201d with \nsuspicion (See, for example, Wilkes, 1988, 17). The claim that because I can form a picture of a fire-\nbreathing dragon in my mind, fire-breathing dragons are possible is indeed dubious. However, my \nmodel-based account of thought experiments avoids these problems. The thought experimenter does \nnot simply visualise herself dropping linked masses, for example, rather she constructs a model in \nwhich she drops linked masses using what she knows about physical laws and the implications of her \nconcepts. Physical laws, and our concepts, have modal implications built into them already. The law \nthat masses attract each other implies that masses in all physically possible worlds attract. Similarly, \nour concept of number implies that whatever other scandals may one day come to light the number \nfive cannot be the illegitimate offspring of Tony Blair (example adapted from Nagel 1998). In so far \nas we believe our scientific theories to be correct, and have a good grasp of our concepts, we can use \nthem to support modal claims. Thought experiments merely make use of modal implications to \nwhich we are already implicitly committed.  \nOn my account, thought experiments can show us whether or not a situation is possible. In \ndoing this they can indirectly teach us about the actual world. Discovering that a situation is \nimpossible shows us how the world cannot be. Similarly, discovering that a situation is necessary \nshows us how the world must be.  \nThought experiments can also be used to explore our model of the actual world, that is they \ncan be used to reveal the implicit consequences of our theories about the world. Thought \nexperiments that seek to discover what our intuitions would be in hypothetical circumstances are of \nthis type. In such thought experiments we construct, and in the process, describe, a possible world in \nwhich there are apparently intelligent Martians, or in which someone is presented with the option of \nPage 13 of 25Thought Experiments\n08\/01\/2008http:\/\/eprints.lancs.ac.uk\/263\/1\/Thought_Experimentsjm2.htm\nkilling one person to save many. Such thought experiments teach us nothing about the world, \nbut rather allow us to explore the implicit consequences of our pre-existing beliefs. \nBrown has claimed that thought experiments can also provide us with new knowledge about \nwhat contingently happens to be the case in the actual world. If Brown\u2019s claim is correct such \nthought experiments pose a serious threat to my account, as it is difficult to see how knowledge of \ncontingent states of affairs can be derived from the construction or representation of possible worlds. \nBrown\u2019s putative example of a thought experiment that provides us with knowledge of \ncontingent matters of fact is one that Galileo used to both demonstrate the falsity of Aristotelian \nphysics, that held that heavy bodies fall faster than light bodies, and also to suggest the correct \nGalilean result, that all bodies fall at the same rate (Galileo, 1974, 66-67). Galileo asks us to imagine \ntwo falling bodies, one heavy and one light, that are tied together. The Aristotelian principle leads us \nto conflicting conclusions. First, we can conclude that, since the light body falls more slowly, by \ntying the two together the heavy body will be slowed down. Second, we can conclude that since the \nmass of the compound body is greater than that of the heavy body alone, the heavy body will now \nfall more quickly. This contradiction shows that Aristotelian physics is wrong and that heavier \nbodies cannot fall more quickly that light bodies. This is the reductio stage of the thought \nexperiment. So far my account has no problems, I can say that the thought experiment showed that \nno consistent model could be produced in which heavy bodies fall faster than light bodies, and that \nthus it could be concluded that the Aristotelian scenario is impossible and so not true of the actual \nworld. \nThe second stage of the thought experiment is more problematic. Galileo now goes on to \ndraw the conclusion that all masses fall at the same rate. An important point is that Galileo need not \nhave reached this conclusion. Showing that heavy bodies do not fall faster than light bodies is \nconsistent with a multitude of alternative theories, such that red balls fall faster than balls of other \ncolours, that square objects fall faster and so on. Brown thinks that Galileo\u2019s success in picking the \nright theory can only be explained by his Platonic account. For Brown the thought experiment \nenables Galileo to perceive the Platonic laws that govern the movement of masses and so see that all \nmasses fall at the same rate. \nThe challenge for my account is to explain how Galileo could have gained knowledge of \ncontingent states of affairs though constructing or representing possible worlds. I think that Galileo\u2019s \nPage 14 of 25Thought Experiments\n08\/01\/2008http:\/\/eprints.lancs.ac.uk\/263\/1\/Thought_Experimentsjm2.htm\nsuccess can be accounted for by thinking of the thought experiment as one that shows that a \nsituation is impossible, working in tandem with various background assumptions. The background \nassumptions are that colour, shape, chemical composition and so on have no effect on the rate at \nwhich a mass falls. These background assumptions serve to limit the options available to Galileo as \nhe attempts to discover the laws governing the behaviour of falling masses. The only options \nconsistent with the background assumptions are that heavy masses fall more quickly than light \nmasses, that light bodies fall more quickly than heavy bodies, or that all masses fall at the same rate. \nThe reductio stage of the thought experiment shows that heavier masses cannot fall more rapidly \nthan light masses, and a parallel thought experiment would show that light bodies cannot fall more \nquickly than heavy bodies. Thus the thought experiment can reveal that the remaining option, that all \nmasses fall at the same rate, is correct. However, this option is not generated by the thought \nexperiment as Brown mistakenly believes, but was put into the thought experiment at the beginning \nas a background assumption. My modelling account can allow for knowledge of contingent states of \naffairs that is generated in such a way, and so escapes the threat posed by Brown\u2019s claim that thought \nexperiments can teach us about contingent matter of fact. \nThe account of thought experimentation I have put forward in this section is similar in some \nrespects to those proposed by Nancy Nersessian (1992) and by Nenad Mi\u0161\u010devi\u0107 (1992). The main \nclaim of all three accounts is that a thought experimenter gains knowledge through manipulating a \nmodel. There are however, important differences between the other accounts and my own. \nFirst, and most importantly, Nersessian\u2019s and Mi\u0161\u010devi\u0107\u2019s models are specifically mental \nmodels of the type thought by some cognitive psychologists to be involved in the comprehension of \nnarratives. Specifically, both philosophers claim to have based their accounts on the work of the \npsychologist  P.N.Johnson-Laird. Nersessian tells us, rather mysteriously, that a mental model is not \na linguistic representation, nor a picture in the mind, but a \u201cstructural analog of the situation \ndescribed\u201d (Nersessian, 1992, 297). Mi\u0161\u010devi\u0107 seems to have a more pictorial view of mental models \nand claims that mental models have a \u201cconcrete and quasi-spatial character\u201d (Mi\u0161\u010devi\u0107, 1992, 220). \nBoth accounts are based on contestable empirical data. If it turns out that mental models of the type \nposited do not exist, then these accounts must be rejected. In contrast, my account uses a much \nlooser notion of \u201cmodel\u201d. Whether the thought experimenter reasons through the situation via \nmanipulating a set of propositions, or a mental picture, or even plasticine characters, makes no \nPage 15 of 25Thought Experiments\n08\/01\/2008http:\/\/eprints.lancs.ac.uk\/263\/1\/Thought_Experimentsjm2.htm\ndifference to my account. In my account the form of the model is unconstrained. This means \nthat my account can cope with possible changes in the details of psychological theory in a way that \nNersessian\u2019s and Mi\u0161\u010devi\u0107\u2019s cannot. \nSecond, Nersessian\u2019s models are restricted to simulating the way in which phenomena would \nunfold in the real world (Nersessian, 1992, 295). Mi\u0161\u010devi\u0107\u2019s examples suggest that he holds a similar \nview. In contrast, in my account, modelled phenomena do not necessarily unfold as they would in \nthe real world as the thought experimenter may model a world in which some laws of nature are \nsuspended or altered. This difference is important. It means that my account can cope with thought \nexperiments that hypothesise physically impossible situations.  \nThird, Nersessian\u2019s models are manipulated in accord with a special \u201csimulative model-based \nreasoning\u201d (Nersessian, 1992, 296). This reasoning specifically excludes the use of deductive and \ninductive inferences, as it is not performed on propositions (Nersessian, 1992, 297). In my account \nthe basic forms of reasoning used to manipulate the model will be the same as those we use to \npredict occurrences in the real world: although such reasoning is not limited to induction and \ndeduction, such inferences are definitely permitted. On this point Mi\u0161\u010devi\u0107 agrees with me. He also \nallows that deductive and inductive reasoning can be employed (Mi\u0161\u010devi\u0107, 1992, 215).  \n  \n  \n4. When thought experiments fail. \n  \nMy account predicts that thought experiments may fail in two ways. The first reason thought \nexperiments can fail is if the thought experimenter is unable to answer the \u201cWhat if?\u201d questions \ncorrectly. Maybe she has no knowledge, either explicit or implicit, of the laws that govern the \nbehaviour of the type of entities she is imagining. Maybe she has knowledge of the laws relevant for \npredicting the behaviour of entities of the imagined type in the actual world, but the laws do not \napply in the hypothesised situation.  \nI suggest that Bernard Williams\u2019 thought experiment concerning people that split like amoeba \nis an example of a thought experiment that fails because we are unable to answer the necessary \n\u201cwhat if\u201d questions (Williams, 1973, 23). Williams asks, \u201cWhat if people split like amoeba?\u201d, but we \nare unable to answer. How exactly could people split like amoeba? Would they split down the \nPage 16 of 25Thought Experiments\n08\/01\/2008http:\/\/eprints.lancs.ac.uk\/263\/1\/Thought_Experimentsjm2.htm\nmiddle, and have one leg and one hand each? In that case they would fall over, and unless \nskin suddenly grew to cover their wounds their organs would fall out. Or are they supposed to split \ninto two mini but complete people? Then presumably, prior to splitting, a person would have to \nsprout an extra head, legs and arms. Either way, the biological logistics required to get the scenario \noff the ground are too complex and gruesome to work out.    \nThe thought experimenter is more likely to make a mistake in answering the \u201cwhat if?\u201d \nquestions if the laws she is using to provide the answers are implicit rather than explicit. When a law \nis explicit, as they typically are in field such as physics, the thought experimenter can clearly see \nwhether the law applies to the situation she is imagining and knows how to apply it. In areas where \nthe concepts we use are less well defined the thought experimenter has to sharpen her concepts as \nshe goes along. As she searches for ways of extending her concepts to deal with previously \nunencountered circumstances she will often rely on analogy. However, reasoning by analogy \ndepends on perceived similarity and what similarities are perceived is critically influenced by the \nway in which two situations are presented. This is why thought experiments using vaguely defined \nconcepts, for example \u201cperson\u201d are so open to criticism (see Wilkes, 1988, for more on this point).  \nThe second reason why thought experiments can fail is because the thought experimenter can \nmake a mistake as to whether she has constructed an internally consistent model. Inconsistency may \nbe difficult to spot. Mathematicians can construct superficially convincing but false proofs, and \nEscher\u2019s pictures appear to represent actually impossible situations. \nAs an example of a thought experiment that fails because the thought experiment thought \nthere was inconsistency where there is not, consider this ancient thought experiment that purports to \nshow that the universe is infinite by a reductio argument (taken from Sorensen, 1992a, 115). We are \nasked to imagine a man at the end of the universe who throws a spear. The spear cannot go forwards \nbecause there is literally nowhere for it to go. Thus it must rebound, which is absurd. We are left to \nconclude that the universe has no edge and so is infinite. This thought experiment fails because the \nthought experimenter has overlooked the fact that it is actually possible for a surface to both be finite \nand have no edge, the surface of a sphere is an example. The thought experimenter mistakenly saw a \ncontradiction when there is none. \nIn general, we can say that a thought experiment is more likely to succeed if the thought \nexperimenter is knowledgeable about the relevant aspects of the actual world. Only if she possesses \nPage 17 of 25Thought Experiments\n08\/01\/2008http:\/\/eprints.lancs.ac.uk\/263\/1\/Thought_Experimentsjm2.htm\neither explicit or implicit knowledge of the behaviour of real phenomena can the thought \nexperimenter predict how hypothetical events would unfold. It also helps if the knowledge being \nused to answer the \u201cwhat if\u201d questions is explicit rather than tacit. When our knowledge of a law is \nexplicit, as it typically will be in fields such as physics, we can see clearly whether the law applies to \nthe situation being imagined. A final, and rather mundane, thought is that it will best to keep the \nimagined situation as simple as possible if we are to avoid getting confused as to whether or not an \nimagined scenario is consistent. \nThought experiments can lead us astray. This has led some to suggest that they should be \nabandoned, and that thought experiments can and should be replaced by real experiments.\n[7]\n These \nwriters are wrong. Although fallible, thought experiments are required for several reasons. Some \nthought experiments are practically possible, but there may be sound reasons for performing them in \nthought only. They may be unethical, or far too expensive to perform in practice. Other thought \nexperiments cannot be replaced by real experiments because they are physically impossible. These \nthought experiments may either involve idealisation or the direct violation of physical laws. I shall \nargue that it is untenable to reject the use of thought experiments of either type.  \nFirst, for thought experiments involving idealisation. An example is Galileo\u2019s thought \nexperiment demonstrating that bodies continue moving with constant velocity in the absence of a \nforce (as described in Sorensen, 1992a, 8-9). Galileo asks us to consider a ball rolling in a friction-\nless U-bend. When dropped from one side, the ball rises to the same height on the second. As the \nsecond side is stretched out the ball has to travel a greater distance to re-obtain the height from which \nit fell. In the limit, if we flatten the second side, the ball will have to travel an infinite distance in an \nattempt to regain its height.  \nThe first point to note is that thought experiments that involve idealisation often resemble the \nlimiting case of the extrapolation of experimental results. When trying to prove a general law, \nscientists often plot the results of some performed experiments on a graph and then interpolate and \nextrapolate from these. Intuitively, the infinite number of possible experiments represented by the \npoints on the line are not thought experiments, although the limiting case of a series of experiments \nperformed with ever decreasing amounts of friction, say, may well be a thought experiment. The \ndifference, it seems to me, lies in the fact that in the case of the thought experiment the experimenter \nvisualises or describes some hypothetical situation, whereas the extrapolator does not imagine the \nPage 18 of 25Thought Experiments\n08\/01\/2008http:\/\/eprints.lancs.ac.uk\/263\/1\/Thought_Experimentsjm2.htm\ninfinite number of possible experiments that concern him. However, aside from the \nvisualisation element, extrapolation and thought experiments involving idealisation are very similar. \nCritics of thought experiments that involve idealisation are going to have a tough time saying why \nextrapolation is justified (as they must, if they are not to reject much science) but such thought \nexperimentation is not. \nInterestingly, thought experiments that aim at exploring our concepts and values by \ndescribing some situation and then asking us what we would say or do involve idealisation. Imagine \na situation in which an agent is faced with having all her fingernails pulled out one by one by a \nsadistic but powerful torturer. She can stop the torture at any point by pressing a red button that will \ntrigger a nuclear explosion and thus kill everyone, herself included. Often when such thought \nexperiments are put to us we are asked what we would do. However, I suggest, what we would do is \nnot really the issue. In several (maybe most) near-by possible worlds in which I have my fingernails \npulled out, I loose all self-control under the pain and press the button. In some of these possible \nworlds, you are just as pathetic. Thus, rather than it being relevant what we would say or do, we \nshould be interested in what some ideally calm, good, and rational person would say or do. In such \ncases thought experiments trump real experiments. The judgements of people contemplating what \nshould be done under torture are more reliable than the judgements of people actually being tortured. \nOther thought experiments cannot be replaced by real experiments because they involve the \nviolation of physical laws. Thus they cannot be performed, nor even approximated. The purpose of \nsuch thought experiments is to shed light on logical possibility. Such thought experiments are very \nsimilar to the computer simulations that scientists often run in order to see how events would unfold \nif the laws of nature were slightly different.\n[8]\n For example, physicists can use computers to model \nhow the universe would unfold if G, the gravitational constant, were different. The thought \nexperimenter models a different world in her head; the simulator uses a computer. At least in simple \ncases, a thought experimenter with a clear grasp of the relevant laws should be as reliable as a \ncomputer simulation. Philosophers who are suspicious of thought experiments in which physical \nlaws are violated are going to need to provide a reason why models produced by people are \nworthless, but computer simulations can be trusted (and they must trust computer simulations, or \nonce again they are forced to reject much scientific practice). I suggest no such reasons will be \nforthcoming, and that simulations and physically impossible thought experiments should both be \nPage 19 of 25Thought Experiments\n08\/01\/2008http:\/\/eprints.lancs.ac.uk\/263\/1\/Thought_Experimentsjm2.htm\nconsidered potential sources of knowledge. \n  \nConclusion \n  \nIn this paper I have presented an account of thought experiments. According to this account, a \nthought experimenter manipulates her world view in accord with the \u201cwhat if\u201d questions posed by a \nthought experiment. When all necessary manipulations are carried through the result is either a \nconsistent model, or contradiction. If a consistent model is achieved the thought experimenter can \nconclude that the scenario is possible, if a consistent model cannot be constructed then the scenario \nis not possible. \nThe account differs from Nersessian\u2019s and Mi\u0161\u010devi\u0107\u2019s model-based accounts in various ways. \nMost importantly, their accounts claims that thought experimenters use mental models, of a type \nposited by some psychologists. In contrast, in my account the nature of the model used by the \nthought experimenter is unconstrained.  \nI have suggested that thought experiments can fail in two ways: The thought experimenter \nmay be unable to answer the \u201cwhat if\u201d questions, or the thought experimenter may make a mistake as \nto whether she has constructed a consistent or inconsistent model. Despite their fallibility, however, \nthought experiments can enable us to gain knowledge. Those who argue that they should be replaced \nby real experiments are mistaken. \n  \n  \nAcknowledgements \nThanks are due to Peter Lipton and Joel Katzav, who read and commented on drafts of this paper. \nVersions of this paper have been presented at Birmingham University and at the Joint Session of \nMind and the Aristotelian Society.

H\u00e4ggqvist (1996) presents an account \nwhereby thought experiments are not arguments but \u201cwork only through their connection with \narguments\u201d. Sidelle (1998) convincingly argues that when the details are spelt out H\u00e4ggqvist\u2019s view \ncollapses into the claim that thought experiments are arguments. \n[3]\n Other writers have given other reasons for rejecting Norton\u2019s account. Gendler (1998) shows that \none of Galileo\u2019s thought experiments cannot be construed as an argument. Bishop (1999) argues that \nNorton\u2019s account cannot account for cases where people disagree about the results of a thought \nexperiment. In such cases the parties reconstruct the thought experiment as two different arguments, \nbut they are discussing the same thought experiment. \n[4]\n Brown provides a brief overview of his account in Brown (1991b.)\n \n[5]\n Brown argues against a causal account of knowledge on the basis of the EPR experiment. He \nclaims that we gain knowledge about the electron\u2019s mate but there is no causal link between the two \nelectrons. However, theories involving tachyonic connections between the electrons would supply \nthe missing causal link (Maudlin 1994). \nPage 24 of 25Thought Experiments\n08\/01\/2008http:\/\/eprints.lancs.ac.uk\/263\/1\/Thought_Experimentsjm2.htm\n[6]\n I accept that pieces of fiction may count as thought experiments, so long as the \u201cwhat if\u201d \nquestions are rigorously followed through. See Davenport (1983) and John (1998) for discussion of \nliterature as thought experiment. \n[7]\n Writers who have argued that real examples should be used instead of thought experiments \ninclude Hull 1997. Wilkes 1988 is sceptical of thought experiments in philosophy. \n[8]\n Humphreys 1993 p.219 also notes that such computer simulations are like thought experiments.\n \nPage 25 of 25Thought Experiments\n08\/01\/2008http:\/\/eprints.lancs.ac.uk\/263\/1\/Thought_Experimentsjm2.htm\n"}
