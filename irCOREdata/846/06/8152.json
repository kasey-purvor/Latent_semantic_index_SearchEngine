Titanite and allanite from a range of mineral deposits in the area have been analysed for U\u2013Pb isotope systematics and trace element chemistry using laser ablation quadrupole inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). Analyses of a single sample from the regional scapolite\u2013albite alteration give an age of 1903 \u00b1 8 Ma (2\u03c3) and may be contemporaneous with the early stages of Fe mineralization (1890\u20131870 Ma). Analyses of titanite and allanite from undeformed IOCG deposits indicate initial alteration at 1862 \u00b1 16 Ma. In many deposits subsequent metamorphic effects reset titanite isotope systematics from 1790 to 1800 Ma, resulting in a spread of U\u2013Pb isotope analyses along concordia. In some instances core regions may record evidence of early thermal events at around 2050 Ma. Titanite and allanite from deformed IOCG deposits on major shear zones record ages from 1785 \u00b1 21 Ma to 1777 \u00b1 20 Ma, corresponding to deformation, metamorphism and secondary hydrothermal alteration as a result of late orogenic movements. The lack of intracrystalline variations in titanite and allanite trace element chemistry suggests that hydrothermal fluid chemistry and metal source were the main controls on mineral trace element chemistry. Titanite from undeformed Fe oxide\u2013apatite and IOCG deposits is typically light rare earth element (LREE) enriched, and shows low U\/Th ratios and low Ni in both intermediate to acid and basic volcanic-hosted deposits. This is consistent with a granitic source for metals. Minor variations in trace element patterns are consistent with the influence of aqueous complex formation on relative REE solubility. Deposits related to the Nautanen Deformation Zone have relatively heavy REE (HREE)-enriched titanite, and LREE-depleted allanite, with high U\/Th ratios and elevated Ni contents, consistent with leaching of metals from the local basic volcanic rocks. All hydrothermal titanites are high field strength element enriched (Nb, Ta, Zr) indicating their transport as a result of either high salinities or high F contents, or both. The data overall support models of IOCG-type mineralization as a result of regional circulation of saline hydrothermal fluids in association with major crustal structures, with at least some metallic components derived from the granitoid rocks of the area.

The data overall support models of IOCG-type mineralization as a result of regional circulation of saline hydrothermal fluids in association with major crustal structures, with at least some metallic components derived from the granitoid rocks of the area. All the deposits here show evidence of subsequent metamorphism, although penetrative fabrics are restricted to regional-scale deformation zones. <\/dc:description><dc:publisher>\n        Oxford University Press<\/dc:publisher><dc:date>\n        2009-11<\/dc:date><dc:type>\n        Journal article<\/dc:type><dc:type>\n        PeerReviewed<\/dc:type><dc:format>\n        text<\/dc:format><dc:language>\n        en<\/dc:language><dc:rights>\n        <\/dc:rights><dc:identifier>\n        http:\/\/eprints.brighton.ac.uk\/6423\/1\/jpet_smith_et_al_09.pdf<\/dc:identifier><dc:identifier>\n          Smith, Martin, Storey, C.D., Jeffries, T.E. and Ryan, C.

Analyses of a single sample from the regional scapolite^\nalbite alteration give an age of 1903\u0002 8 Ma (2\u0002) and may be con-\ntemporaneous with the early stages of Fe mineralization (1890^\n1870 Ma). Analyses of titanite and allanite from undeformed\nIOCG deposits indicate initial alteration at 1862\u000216 Ma. In\nmany deposits subsequent metamorphic effects reset titanite isotope\nsystematics from 1790 to 1800 Ma, resulting in a spread of U^Pb\nisotope analyses along concordia. In some instances core regions may\nrecord evidence of early thermal events at around 2050 Ma.Titanite\nand allanite from deformed IOCG deposits on major shear zones\nrecord ages from 1785\u0002 21 Ma to 1777\u0002 20 Ma, corresponding to\ndeformation, metamorphism and secondary hydrothermal alteration\nas a result of late orogenic movements.The lack of intracrystalline\nvariations in titanite and allanite trace element chemistry suggests\nthat hydrothermal fluid chemistry and metal source were the main\ncontrols on mineral trace element chemistry. Titanite from unde-\nformed Fe oxide^apatite and IOCG deposits is typically light rare\nearth element (LREE) enriched, and shows low U\/Th ratios and\nlow Ni in both intermediate to acid and basic volcanic-hosted\ndeposits.This is consistent with a granitic source for metals. Minor\nvariations in trace element patterns are consistent with the influence\nof aqueous complex formation on relative REE solubility. Deposits\nrelated to the Nautanen Deformation Zone have relatively heavy\nREE (HREE)-enriched titanite, and LREE-depleted allanite,\nwith high U\/Th ratios and elevated Ni contents, consistent with\nleaching of metals from the local basic volcanic rocks. All hydrother-\nmal titanites are high field strength element enriched (Nb,Ta, Zr)\nindicating their transport as a result of either high salinities or high\nF contents, or both.The data overall support models of IOCG-type\nmineralization as a result of regional circulation of saline hydrother-\nmal fluids in association with major crustal structures, with at\nleast some metallic components derived from the granitoid rocks of\nthe area. All the deposits here show evidence of subsequent metamor-\nphism, although penetrative fabrics are restricted to regional-scale\ndeformation zones.\nKEY WORDS: allanite; IOCG; Kiruna; titanite; U^Pb geochronology\nI NTRODUCTION\nThe iron oxide^copper^gold (IOCG) family of deposits,\noriginally proposed by Hitzman et al.

Williams et al.\n(2005) proposed as criteria the presence of Cu with or\nwithout Au as economic metals, hydrothermal vein, brec-\ncia and\/or replacement ore styles, characteristically in spe-\ncific structural sites, abundant magnetite and\/or hematite,\nlow Ti contents in iron oxides relative to those in most\nigneous rocks and the absence of clear spatial associations\nwith igneous intrusions. Common features, not always\npresent, also listed byWilliams et al. (2005) included crustal\nsettings with exceptionally voluminous, generally perva-\nsive, alkali metasomatism, and a suite of minor elements\nincluding F, P, Co, Ni, As, Mo, Ag, Ba, light rare earth ele-\nments (LREE) and U. Shallower systems may show serici-\ntic and carbonate alteration alongside widespread\nhematite (e.g. Olympic Dam). This review paper also defi-\nnitively stated that Kiruna-type Fe-oxide deposits and Fe\nskarns are not IOCG deposits, but share many characteris-\ntics and may be linked. Recent work has suggested a signif-\nicant difference in the timing of the two deposit types\n(Hitzman, 2000); however, the early stage magnetite alter-\nation in many IOCG deposits, the late-stage occurrence\nof pyrite, chalcopyrite and gold in and near massive mag-\nnetite deposits, and the common alteration features asso-\nciated with both deposit types still support a link (Sillitoe,\n2003). The overall genetic mechanisms of the deposits\nremain a subject of debate, with current models ranging\nfrom the circulation of brines derived from calc-alkaline\nmagmas along major tectonic structures (Pollard, 2006),\nto mineralization related to the circulation of fluids\nderived either from the dissolution of evaporites or from\ncontinental surface brines (Barton & Johnson, 1996, 2000).\nWilliams et al. (2005) concluded that a range of processes\nmay give rise to the common characteristics, and that a\nrange of sources may contribute hydrothermal fluid com-\nponents in different settings, and therefore more research\nis needed before it can be concluded that either a single\ngenetic mechanism, or a range of mechanisms in different\ngeological environments lead to the formation of deposits\nwith common characteristics.\nThe Kiruna district in Sweden is the type area for Fe\noxide^apatite deposits, and hosts a number of actively or\nhistorically mined deposits that have been linked to the\nIOCG class. Geochronological data from the area have\nnot yet fully distinguished the IOCG and magnetite^\napatite deposits in time, and major debates remain about\nthe genetic mechanism of both deposit types. Equally, the\ncomplex geological history of the district means that bulk\ngrain analytical techniques for phases such as zircon and\ntitanite do not adequately distinguish the multiple thermal\nevents that have affected rocks from the area (Storey\net al., 2007). Here we present an in situ study of the U^Pb\nisotope systematics and trace element chemistry of titanite\nand allanite from a range of deposits, carried out using\nlaser-ablation inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrome-\ntry (LA-ICP-MS). Despite the lower precision of this tech-\nnique compared with isotope dilution thermal ionization\nmass spectrometry (ID-TIMS), the increased spatial reso-\nlution and capability for in situ analyses of texturally char-\nacterized grains (Storey et al., 2006, 2007) means that this\ntechnique is ideal for application in mineral deposits with\ncomplex post-mineralization histories. The deposits\nsampled cover a significant range in structural setting, but\nsimilarities in alteration style, and hence potential genetic\nmechanisms, indicate that it is pertinent to examine the\ndeposits together.\nBACKGROUND GEOLOGY\nThe major iron ore province of northern Sweden is hosted\nwithin Palaeoproterozoic rocks, mainly Karelian (2\u00b75^2\u00b70\nGa) and Svecofennian (1\u00b79^1\u00b788 Ga) in age, which extend\nfrom northern Sweden into Finland and parts of northern\nNorway (Fig. 1). The geology and metallogeny of the\nNorrbotten area have recently been reviewed by Carlon\n(2000) and Bergman et al. (2001). The Palaeoproterozoic\nrocks of the area were deposited between 2\u00b75 and 1\u00b785 Ga\nand are now preserved in deformed metamorphic belts,\nintruded by a range of granitoid plutons. The Greenstone\nGroup (41\u00b79 Ga) consists of tholeiitic to komatiitic volcanic\nrocks (Ekdahl, 1993; Martinsson, 1997) and is overlain first\nby the Middle Sediment Group (Witschard, 1984), then by\nthe dominantly andesitic Porphyrite Group, which\nconsists of volcanic and sub-volcanic rocks, and then\nby the Kiirunavaara Group (Martinsson, 2004). The\nKiirunavaara Group consists of syenitic and quartz-\nsyenitic igneous rocks and intercalated sediments, which\nhost the Kiirunavaara magnetite^apatite deposit. The sye-\nnitic character of these rocks may be the result of alteration\noverprinting an original calc-alkaline signature. The\nHaparanda and Perthite calc-alkaline and alkali^calcic\nmonzonite granite suites intruded these rocks between 1\u00b79\nand 1\u00b78 Ga (Skio\u00ab ld, 1987) followed by the Lina suite grani-\ntoids at around 1\u00b779 Ga (Skio\u00ab ld, 1988; Bergman et al.,\n2001). A period of deformation and metamorphism of the\nsupracrustal sequence accompanied the intrusion of these\ngranitoids, with conditions peaking at upper greenschist\nor lower amphibolite facies (Bergman et al., 2001). The\nyoungest plutonic rocks in the area are TIB 2 granitoids,\nat around 1\u00b771 Ga in age, exposed at the Swedish^\nNorwegian border (Romer et al., 1992).\nThe volcanic sequence is affected by scapolitization and\nalbitization at both the regional and deposit scale,\nJOURNAL OF PETROLOGY VOLUME 00 NUMBER 0 MONTH 2009\n2\nin association with both iron oxide and Cu^(Au) mineral-\nization (Frietsch et al., 1997). The Fe oxide^apatite bodies\nare typified by the Kiirunavaara^Luossavaara body,\ndominated by magnetite, and the Per Geiger ores, with\nboth hematite and magnetite (Geijer, 1910, 1931;\nMartinsson, 2004). The deposits are accompanied by sodic\nand potassic alteration (albite^K-feldspar^biotite), in\nsome instances including scapolite. Potassic alteration typi-\ncally overprints sodic alteration, but multiple events do\noccur in some deposits (e.g. Rakkurija\u00ab rvi, Smith et al.,\n2007). The IOCG-type deposits occur both as relatively\nundeformed bodies hosted by the Greenstone, Porphyrite\nand Kiirunavaara Groups (e.g. Pahtohavare; Lindblom\net al., 1996) and as strongly deformed bodies associated\nwith major deformation zones [e.g. Nautanen and Aitik\non the Nautanen Deformation Zone (NDZ); Martinsson\n& Wanhainen, 2004]. Chalcopyrite mineralization is typi-\ncally spatially associated with early magnetite and scapo-\nlite^albite alteration and later potassic and finally\ncarbonate alteration, although major Cu-mineralization is\ntypically later than the development of magnetite. The\nNDZ is a NNW-trending tectonic structure in which\nstrongly schistose or mylonitic rocks occur in several high-\nstrain branches in a zone up to 3 km wide. The Nautanen\ndeposit is hosted in sheared quartz veins associated with\nK-feldspar^epidote alteration, scapolitization, tourmalini-\nzation, sericitization and the development of metasomatic\ngarnet (Martinsson & Wanhainen, 2004).\nFig. 1.

KIRUNA DISTRICT MINERALIZATION\n3\nThe samples used in this study are described in Table 1\nand the sample site geology is shown in Figs 2 and 3. The\nsites include Fe oxide^apatite bodies (Kiirunavaara^\nLuossavaara; Malmberget; Gruvberget), relatively unde-\nformed IOCG deposits [Rakkurija\u00ab rvi (Smith et al., 2007);\nKallosalmi (Wa\u00ab gman & Ohlsson; 2000); Gruvberget\n(Martinsson & Virrkunen, 2004)] and deposits hosted by\nthe NDZ. Samples were also taken from massive scapolite\nskarn-hosted Cu^Mo mineralization at Sarkivaara\n(Wa\u00ab gman & Ohlsson, 2000), and from the footwall sodic\naltered granodiorite at the actively mined Cu^Au deposit\nat Aitik (Wanhainen et al., 2003). These samples both had\nvery low U concentration and high 206Pb\/204Pb contents,\nand so did not yield reliable U^Pb ages but are included\nfor their trace element data. U^Pb isotope and REE com-\npositional data from samples from Luossavaara,\nMalmberget and Gruvberget were previously reported by\nStorey et al. (2007); here we present an expanded range of\ntrace element analyses and compare these samples with\nthose from other deposit types.\nMETHODS\nRock samples were cut into polished sections c. 150 mm\nthick revealing large crystals of titanite exposed at the sur-\nface. These were studied optically and as uncoated speci-\nmens using a JEOL 5900LV scanning electron microscope\n(SEM) at the Natural History Museum, London (NHM)\noperating at low vacuum conditions to minimize charging\neffects. U^Pb isotope analyses were then undertaken by\nLA-ICP-MS at the NHM. Samples were then very lightly\npolished and cleaned to removed excavated material from\nthe vicinity of laser ablation (LA) pits, then carbon\ncoated for electron microprobe analysis (EMPA). This was\ndone after the U^Pb analyses to ensure that the coating\nprocess did not add contamination to sample surfaces.\nEMPA sites were made as close as possible to the U^Pb\nLA pits. After this the coating was carefully removed for\ntrace element analysis by LA-ICP-MS, which was per-\nformed at each EMPA site. Samples were finally gently\npolished and cleaned before being re-coated for further\nhigh-quality electron imaging.\nU^Pb isotope analysis\nSample surfaces were cleaned by rinsing with dilute\n(c. 5%) HNO3 and deionized water. Once fully dry, the\nsamples were mounted in a specially adapted laser cell for\nthick sections, and loaded into a NuWave UP213 Nd:YAG\nlaser (\u0003\u00bc213 nm) port, linked to a PlasmaQuad 3 quadru-\npole ICP-MS system (Storey et al., 2006). Operating condi-\ntions are listed in Table 2. Laser beam diameter and line\nscan length are listed for each analysis in Table 3 and\nElectronic Appendix 1, which is available for downloading\nat http:\/\/www.petrology.oxfordjournals.org\/. Line raster\nscans were performed within areas of distinct\nbackscattered electron (BSE) image contrast.\nNormalization to zircon geostandard 91500 (Wiedenbeck\net al., 1995) and age calculation were performed off-line\nusing the macro spreadsheet-based procedure\nLAMTRACE, developed by S. Jackson of Macquarie\nUniversity, Australia. Storey et al. (2006) demonstrated\nthat when using rastered lines matrix matching was not a\nprerequisite for precise and accurate U^Pb analyses of tita-\nnite. Plotting of U^Pb data was performed using\nISOPLOT v. 3 (Ludwig, 2003). The time-resolved plot of\nPb\/Pb and Pb\/U ratios from each analysis was studied\nand only analyses, or coherent parts of analyses, that\nshowed no mixed age data, secondary phases or poten-\ntially contaminated fractures encountered during analysis\nwere chosen for final age calculation. All analyses were\ncorrected for common Pb by measurement of the 204Pb\nisotope, corrected for isobaric interference from Hg aided\nby the use of inline gold traps on the carrier gas lines\n(Storey et al., 2006). Pb\/U ratios were corrected using\nmodel terrestrial Pb composition values (Stacey &\nKramers, 1975) at the age of crystallization.\nThe main measured ratio contributing to discordance\nafter applying a 204Pb common Pb correction was the\n207Pb\/235U ratio. This is due to the much lower concentra-\ntion of these isotopes. In this study we chose to propagate\nmeasured uncertainty from only the 201Hg\/204Hg(Pb)\nonto the 207Pb\/235U uncertainty and not the more precisely\nmeasured 206Pb\/238U ratio. The result in nearly all cases is\nthat the error ellipses overlap concordia, implying that all\nrelevant sources of uncertainty have been taken into\naccount. We report the age based on the 206Pb\/238U ratio\ncorrected for common Pb based on these factors, apart\nfrom where discussed separately below. Pb\/U and Pb\/Pb\nisotopic data are presented in Table 3 alongside common\nPb-corrected ages based on the 207Pb\/206Pb mathematical\napproach (Williams, 1998) for comparison with 204Pb cor-\nrected ages. The full dataset is available in Electronic\nAppendix 1.\nSEM characterization and electron\nmicroprobe analysis\nFollowing LA-ICP-MS U^Pb isotope analysis, samples\nwere carbon coated and examined using the backscattered\nelectron (BSE) mode of a JEOL 6310 SEM at the\nUniversity of Brighton to accurately locate the ablation\nsites. The titanites were then chemically analysed using a\nCameca SX50 electron microprobe housed at the NHM.\nRun conditions were 15 kV accelerating voltage and a\nbeam current of 20 nA.

A second set of\nanalyses was also run including F and using topaz as a\nstandard. Results are shown in Tables 4 and 5.\nTrace element analysis\nTrace element analyses of titanite and allanite were carried\nout using the same analytical equipment as that for U^Pb\nanalysis, except that the in-line Au traps were removed.\nAll analyses used NIST 612 glass as an external standard,\nand used Ca determined by electron microprobe as an\ninternal standard to convert element ratios to absolute con-\ncentrations. The 1s precision on NIST 612 glass from this\nstudy is typically around 2^4%. Accuracy was monitored\nusing a glass prepared from Colombia River Basalt\n(USGS sample BCR-2G). The results are compared with\naccepted values for BCR-2 rock powder and previous anal-\nyses of BCR-2G inTable 6. Our results are within error of\nthe accepted values for BCR-2 or within the published\nrange of analyses of BCR-2G (Jochum et al., 2005) for\nmost elements. Our values are significantly different for\nMn, U,Ti, Mo and Sr, but it has been noted that the glass\nhas heterogeneities for some elements (notably Mo) intro-\nduced by the glass preparation procedure (Norman et al.,\n1998). The cross-comparison between glass secondary\nstandards and minerals is valid as numerous studies have\nFig. 2.

We are therefore confident that\nour analyses reflect both relative and absolute variation in\ntrace element concentrations in titanite.\nRESULTS\nU^Pb geochronology of titanite and allanite\nU^Pb isotopic data from morphologically complex titanite\ngrains from Luossavaara, Gruvberget and theValkommen\nbody at Malmberget have previously been discussed by\nStorey et al. (2007). BSE imaging of these titanites revealed\nlow mean atomic number (Z) cores and high mean Z over-\ngrowths. REE analyses indicated in two out of three sam-\nples that the core and rim zones are distinct and support\na model for two-stage growth. In situ U^Pb analysis reveals\nthat the titanite cores in all three samples retain distinct\nolder ages of c. 2050 Ma, whereas the rims have either dis-\ntinct younger or strongly reset ages. The older cores were\ninterpreted as representing the first alteration or metamor-\nphism of the volcanic pile. In the case of the rims,\nFig. 3.

KIRUNA DISTRICT MINERALIZATION\n7\na sample from Luossavaara records a U^Pb age of\n1870\u000224 Ma (2s), whereas in a sample from Gruvberget\nthe rims record a U^Pb age of 1820\u000210 Ma (2s), consis-\ntent with previous studies (Romer et al., 1994). In the\nsample from Malmberget U^Pb ages spread along concor-\ndia from c. 1920 to 1708 Ma, attributed to metamorphic\nrehomogenization of primary metasomatic titanite in\naccordance with the strong deformation and metamor-\nphism of the deposit.\nFor the new data presented here a number of samples\ndisplay a spread of analyses along concordia, and in one\ninstance record discordant ages. We have utilized cumula-\ntive probability plots based on 206Pb\/238U ages to identify\nnormally distributed ages, where a weighted mean of anal-\nyses may have real significance, and samples where there\nis significant spread along concordia to identify peaks in\nthe probability distribution. Lead loss as a result of subse-\nquent metamorphism or weathering may explain this;\nhowever, the textures in many examples, including cores\nwith infilled microporosity at the junction with the\nrim (Fig. 4a), BSE light core remnants with darker over-\ngrowths and fracture fills (Fig. 4b) and chemically homog-\nenous, porous grains, strongly indicate that coupled\ndissolution^reprecipitation (Putnis, 2002) is the most\nlikely and kinetically favourable mechanism for chemical\nand isotopic rehomogenization of titanite. Indicative tex-\ntures of this recrystallization mechanism have now been\nreported from zircon in a number of settings (e.g.\nTomaschek et al., 2003). Because of this we interpret multi-\nple peaks in most cumulative probability plots as indicat-\ning discrete events rather than continuous diffusive\nlead loss.\nGreenstone Group diorite samples from the Nunasvaara\narea are scapolitized and brecciated, with large amounts\nof actinolite forming the matrix and locally large crystals\nof titanite (Table 1). BSE imaging of one grain c. 1cm in\ndiameter revealed that it comprises BSE dark areas over-\nprinted by BSE lighter areas around grain rims and along\nfractures. The dark areas have lower U concentrations\nand higher 207Pb\/206Pb ratios, and the light areas provide\na group of concordant (or near concordant) homogeneous\nages (Table 3, Fig. 5). The analyses from the BSE dark\nareas did not result in reliable ages and are omitted here.\nThe whole crystal appears to have undergone some degree\nof recent Pb loss resulting in discordance, and so the rim\nanalyses are regressed through 0 Ma. The result is a well-\nconstrained age of 1903\u00028 Ma from the young group of\nBSE bright analyses.\nSample KR1 was taken from the hanging wall to the\nmain magnetite^apatite mineralization at Kiirunavaara\n(Table 1), where titanite with a grain size up to 1mm in\ndiameter occurs in the quartz^calcite matrix of a metavol-\ncanic breccia. Of 24 analyses, 22 had detectable amounts\nof common Pb (Table 3). Corrected analyses overlap con-\ncordia (Fig. 6b) and spread from c. 1850 to 1750 Ma with a\nweighted mean age of 1801\u000225 Ma (95% confidence).\nThe spread along concordia could be attributed to either\nminor Pb loss or a later thermal event. A bimodal distribu-\ntion of single 206Pb\/238U ages indicates this mean does not\nrepresent a possible age. The older age (1894\u000235 Ma)\nalong this spectrum is within error of the calculated age\nfor Fe oxide^apatite mineralization in the footwall to the\nLuossavaara deposit a few kilometres along strike from\nKR1 of 1870\u000224 Ma (Storey et al, 2007; Table 3), as is the\ninitial cumulative probability peak at 1860 Ma. Because of\nthe well-preserved zonation, and hence lack of textural evi-\ndence for recrystallization by dissolution^reprecipitation\n(Putnis, 2002), it is considered likely that titanite began to\ncrystallize during mineralization at Kiirunavaara and\nunderwent a later thermal resetting event at c. 1780\nMa where there is a second mode in the cumulative proba-\nbility plot.\nTable 2:

Rakkurija\u00ab rvi Cu^Au prospect\n(Table 1; Smith et al., 2007). The sample shows early albiti-\nzation (sodic alteration) overprinted by subsequent\nK-feldspar^scapolite (sodic^potassic) alteration (Smith\net al., 2007). Sample 01 RAK 006 183.2m contains oscilla-\ntory zoned, subhedral allanite grains c. 500 mm in diameter,\nand small, euhedral titanite grains c. 100 mm in diameter.\nIn all, 24 analyses were made,18 on allanite and six on tita-\nnite, using a beam diameter of 60 mm. Most of the analyses\nare slightly to moderately discordant, and lie on a mixing\nline between the age on U^Pb concordia and the\ncommon Pb composition. Allanite 204Pb-corrected data\nstraddle the concordia (Fig. 7c) and give a well-defined\nunimodal probability peak (Fig. 7d). All 204Pb-corrected\n206Pb\/238U ages have a weighted average age of\n1854\u000218 Ma (95% confidence; Fig. 7c), compared with a\nweighted average of 207Pb\/206Pb-corrected 206Pb\/238U\nages of 1862\u000216 Ma (95% confidence). These U^Pb ages\nare all within error of each other and with Re^Os age\ndata for molybdenite (1853\u00026 and 1862\u00026 Ma; Smith\net al., 2007), and are therefore considered to be reliable.\nThe titanites define a spread along the concordia from c.\n1850 to 1750 Ma (Fig.7c), with a bimodal cumulative prob-\nability distribution (Fig.7e).This may be due to the smaller\nsize of the titanite grains relative to allanite, resulting in\nenhanced Pb loss, or resetting via dissolution^reprecipita-\ntion during subsequent fluid flow events. Both the allanite\nU^Pb and molybdenite Re^Os ages indicate that sulphide\nmineralization at Rakkurija\u00ab rvi occurred at c. 1\u00b786 Ga\n(Smith et al., 2007). The earliest mode in the cumulative\nprobability plot (Fig. 7e) is at \u00041880^1860 Ma and\nTable 5: Representative electron microprobe analyses of allanite\nDetection\nlimit\nRakkurija\u00a8rvi 01RAK006 Nautanen NAU84012\nNa2O 0\u00b702 0\u00b701 0\u00b700 0\u00b705 0\u00b701\nCaO 0\u00b701 12\u00b74 13\u00b77 18\u00b79 20\u00b73\nMgO 0\u00b702 0\u00b791 0\u00b747 0\u00b726 0\u00b721\nMnO 0\u00b702 0\u00b713 0\u00b713 0\u00b754 0\u00b733\nFe2O3 0\u00b702 15\u00b77 16\u00b73 13\u00b76 13\u00b78\nTiO2 0\u00b711 0\u00b768 0\u00b739 0\u00b707 0\u00b710\nLa2O3 0\u00b712 10\u00b71 8\u00b77 2\u00b76 2\u00b70\nCe2O3 0\u00b711 9\u00b75 7\u00b79 3\u00b74 2\u00b72\nPr2O3 0\u00b709 0\u00b769 0\u00b760 0\u00b743 0\u00b733\nNd2O3 0\u00b709 0\u00b784 0\u00b780 1\u00b736 0\u00b787\nSiO2 0\u00b703 31\u00b78 32\u00b73 35\u00b71 36\u00b71\nAl2O3 0\u00b701 14\u00b79 15\u00b76 20\u00b73 21\u00b76\nH2O\n\u0003 1\u00b76 1\u00b77 1\u00b78 1\u00b79\nTotal 99\u00b74 98\u00b77 98\u00b77 99\u00b78\nFormula to 13 (O, OH)\nNa 0\u00b7002 0\u00b7000 0\u00b7008 0\u00b7002\nCa 1\u00b7213 1\u00b7325 1\u00b7722 1\u00b7795\nMg 0\u00b7124 0\u00b7064 0\u00b7032 0\u00b7026\nMn 0\u00b7010 0\u00b7010 0\u00b7039 0\u00b7023\nFe 1\u00b7072 1\u00b7105 0\u00b7870 0\u00b7858\nTi 0\u00b7185 0\u00b7106 0\u00b7018 0\u00b7026\nLa 0\u00b7338 0\u00b7289 0\u00b7081 0\u00b7062\nCe 0\u00b7315 0\u00b7263 0\u00b7106 0\u00b7066\nPr 0\u00b7158 0\u00b7135 0\u00b7013 0\u00b7010\nNd 0\u00b7027 0\u00b7026 0\u00b7041 0\u00b7026\nSi 2\u00b7893 2\u00b7916 2\u00b7985 2\u00b7977\nAl 1\u00b7603 1\u00b7655 2\u00b7035 2\u00b7099\n\u0003H2O calculated assuming a full hydroxyl site occupancy.\nSMITH et al.

The later mode is at\n\u00041780 Ma and records Pb loss probably as a result of a\nthermal metamorphic event.\nSamples from the Kallosalmi prospect are hosted by an\nintensely scapolite^actinolite altered metabasalt (Table 1).\nCoarse grains of titanite up to 2mm in diameter occur\nwithin the groundmass. The titanite grains are complexly\nzoned, comprising both BSE dark and light areas that\nprobably represent relict cores surrounded by complex\npatchy zones and fracture fills that are generally dark or\nintermediate with some lighter patches. The texture is\nindicative of dissolution^reprecipitation (Figs 4b and 8a).\nIn all cases common Pb was not detectable (Table 3) and\nthe analyses nearly all overlap concordia (Fig. 8b). There\nis a spread of 206Pb\/238U ages along the concordia from c.\n1950 to 1720 Ma (Table 3; Fig. 8b).

In sample NAU84012 159.8m titanite grains,\nranging from 1 to 2mm in diameter (Fig. 9a), occur in a\nwell-foliated epidote^actinolite^albite schist, and are\naligned with the schistosity. They are typically composi-\ntionally homogeneous, with some fracturing.

U^Pb\ntitanite and allanite analyses cluster about the concordia\n(Fig. 9c) and define a single mode (Fig. 9d and e), yielding\na weighted average of 206Pb\/238U ages of 1777\u000220 Ma.\nOne allanite analysis is much younger at c. 1580 Ma\n(Table 3). In sample NAU77006 164.28m titanite is asso-\nciated with scapolite^actinolite^albite alteration, over-\nprinted by epidotization. Titanite in this sample is zoned,\nwith small patches of BSE light titanite (possibly relicts of\nan original core) surrounded by BSE darker titanite,\nwhich notably occurs around fractures and areas of inter-\nnal porosity (Fig. 10a). U^Pb analyses are mostly concor-\ndant and unimodal (Fig. 10b and c), and yield a combined\nweighted average 206Pb\/238U age of 1785\u000221 Ma. These\ntwo independent ages from Nautanen are identical and\nsuggest an event at c. 1780 Ma.The range of ages indicated\nat Nautanen is comparable with the c. 1800^1780 Ma\ndeformed alteration and vein-assemblages identified as a\npart of a recent study of the Aitik deposit by Wanhainen\net al. (2005), which indicated several thermal and hydro-\nthermal events affecting the deposit from 1888 to 1728 Ma.\nMajor element chemistry of titanite\nand allanite\nThe major element compositions of titanite by electron\nmicroprobe are summarized in Table 4, and plotted in\nFig. 11. The primary variations in chemistry responsible\nfor the zonation in titanite are the contents of Fe (calcu-\nlated as Fe3\u00fe) and Al3\u00fe (Fig. 11a and b). F contents were\nnot routinely determined as a part of the analyses, but\nrarely exceed 0\u00b737wt % (\u00040\u00b715 a.p.f.u., Table 4). The REE\nshow a negative correlation with Ca (Fig. 11c), with a ratio\nof \u00042Ca:1REE, suggesting the substitution of the REE\nonto the Ca site (Ribbe, 1980). Positive correlations with\nNa and Fe (Fig. 11d and e) suggest substitution mechanisms\nsuch as [Ca2\u00fe]^2[REE\n3\u00fe]\u00fe1[Na\n\u00fe]\u00fe1 and [Ca\n2\u00fe]\u00051[Ti\n4\u00fe]\u00051\n[REE3\u00fe]\u00fe1[M\n3\u00fe]\u00fe1 (Ribbe, 1980). Allanite was analysed\nfrom Rakkurija\u00ab rvi and Nautanen (Table 5, Fig. 12).\nRakkurija\u00ab rvi allanite is dominated by the ferriallanite com-\nponent, whereas at Nautanen compositions are closer to an\nREE-bearing epidote with a slight excess of Al relative to\nFe3\u00fe (Fig. 12; Petrik et al., 1995).\nFig. 5.

The rims are also enriched in other HFSE\n(Zr, Hf, Nb, Th); Th is enriched relative to U, and V is\nenriched relative to other the deposit types (Fig. 15). The\ntrace element patterns from the sample from\nKiirunavaara are similar to those of the rims of the\nLuossavaara sample, but with higher contents of Zr and\nHf. The sample from Malmberget is distinct from the\nKiruna area samples in terms of its REE pattern, and in\nhaving relatively higher contents of Ta and U. Most tita-\nnites from Fe-oxide^apatite deposits (excepting distinct\ngrain cores) show negative Eu anomalies and positive Y\nanomalies with a trend of increasingly negative Eu with\ndecreasing Ce\/Lu ratio (Fig. 16).

All models unanimously agree on the impor-\ntance of highly saline hydrothermal fluids, either immedi-\nately post-ore formation (Broman et al., 1999; Harlov et al.,\n2002), or as the main iron-transporting medium (Oreskes\net al., 1995; Sillitoe, 2003). The titanite from the Fe oxide^\napatite bodies examined in this study formed during two-\nstage growth (Storey et al., 2007). The cores of grains at\nLuossavaara and Gruvberget are Fe and trace element\ndepleted, and give much earlier U^Pb ages than grain\nrims and other ore-related phases (see below), indicating\nthey formed before the main ore depositing stage and thus\nprobably during pre-ore metamorphism (possibly the\ninitial hydrothermal metamorphism) of the volcanic pile.\nTitanite nucleates on and replaces rutile at Gruvberget\n(Storey et al., 2007). Early metasomatic assemblages in\namygdales involving rutile, quartz and calc-silicate miner-\nals can react to form titanite-bearing assemblages at tem-\nperatures between 300 and 5008C, depending on pressure\nand XCO2 (Frost et al., 2000). Blake (1990) suggested that\nthe titanite^magnetite^actinolite amygdales at\nKiirunavaara and Luossavaara were magmatic exsolution\nfeatures. The data on timing and textures presented here\nand by Storey et al. (2007) strongly argue against such an\norigin because of the complex internal zoning and the 100\nMyr difference in age between titanite cores and rims.\nRomer et al. (1994) attributed the formation of titanite in\namygdales at Kiirunavaara and Luossavaara to post-ore\nhydrothermal processes, but given the similarities in trace\nelement composition between titanite rims and the apatite\nFig. 10.

The titanite sampled from\nKiirunavaara (KR1) is unequivocally a hydrothermal\nphase. Titanite at Malmberget undoubtedly formed via\nsimilar processes to those operating at Luossavaara and\nGruvberget, but the Malmberget deposits are strongly\ndeformed and have been metamorphosed at greenschist-\nto lower amphibolite-facies conditions (Martinsson &\nVirkkunen, 2004).The preservation of U^Pb isotopic heter-\nogeneity, rather than complete homogenization during Pb\nloss, is a result of the relatively high closure temperature\n(\u0004650^7008C in titanite without radiation damage;\nCherniak, 1993; Frost et al., 2000). The trace element\nFig. 11. Variations in titanite crystal chemistry.\nSMITH et al. KIRUNA DISTRICT MINERALIZATION\n19\nhomogeneity of the titanite at Malmberget is almost\ncertainly a primary feature, as the activation energy\nfor REE diffusion in titanite is higher than for Pb\n(Cherniak, 1995).\nIOCGs\nThe Cu^(Au) deposits studied are all variants of the\nIOCG type. The only published studies of the formation\nconditions of IOCG-type deposits in Norrbotten come\nfrom Pahtohavare (Lindblom et al., 1996) and the Aitik\ndeposit within the NDZ (Wanhainen et al., 2003), with\nreconnaissance data being reported by Broman &\nMartinsson (2000). Preliminary fluid inclusion data from\nKallosalmi and Rakkurija\u00ab rvi indicate similar conditions\nto those found at Pahtohavare, whereas conditions at\nNautanen were at least superficially similar to those at\nAitik (Smith & Gleeson, 2005). Minimum P^T conditions\nfor mineralization at Kallosalmi, Rakkurija\u00ab rvi and\nPahtohavare are around 5 kbar and 4008C (Lindblom\net al., 1996; Broman & Martinsson, 2000) from fluids with\naround 45wt % NaCl eq. All the deposits have undergone\nmetamorphism to some extent (Bergman et al., 2001),\nalthough the development of penetrative fabrics is limited\nto the main deformation zones, and so the fluid inclusions\nmay have been reset. However, stretching of fluid inclu-\nsions during deformation typically results in an increase\nin liquid^vapour homogenization temperature (Vityk,\n1995), which would reduce the temperature gap between\nliquid^vapour homogenization and halite dissolution and\nhence result in a lower pressure estimate at halite dissolu-\ntion than in undeformed inclusions (Bodnar, 1994).\nEqually, fluid loss through leakage would increase esti-\nmated salinities. The P estimates on the basis of fluid inclu-\nsion data are therefore true minima. At Nautanen early\nstage fluids were similar to those in the undeformed\nIOCGs, but fluid circulation along the NDZ continued sig-\nnificantly after the initial mineralization, giving the asso-\nciated deposits an extended fluid^rock interaction history,\ninvolving the superposition of numerous events\n(Wanhainen et al., 2003, 2005).These constraints are consis-\ntent with the hydrothermal formation of titanite syn-ore\ndeposition, but with significant potential for post-\nformation modification. All deposits show evidence of\ngreenschist-facies metamorphism, but these effects are\nmore pronounced within the NDZ; as noted above, pene-\ntrative fabrics are typically limited to deformation zones.\nAllanite at Rakkurija\u00ab rvi and Nautanen is texturally and\nchemically distinct. At Rakkurija\u00ab rvi Smith et al. (2007)\nlinked allanite formation to high-temperature K^Fe alter-\nation, pre- to syn ore deposition. At Nautanen allanite\n(strictly an REE-rich epidote) occurs as cores or as zones\nin epidote grains, and is REE depleted relative to the\nRakkurija\u00ab rvi allanites (Fig. 9). Within the NDZ at Aitik\nWanhainen et al. (2005) linked epidote alteration to the\nlater stages of the main ore associated alteration.\nTiming of magmatism, tectonism and\nmineralization\nGeochronological data from this study are compared with\nprevious results in the context of the timing of the\nSvecokarelian orogeny in Fig. 17. The implications of con-\ncordant U^Pb ages from titanite cores at Luossavaara,\nGruvberget and Malmberget have previously been dis-\ncussed by Storey et al. (2007) and indicate a thermal event\naffecting the volcanic rocks of the Norrbotten district\nfrom 2100 to 2000 Ma, suggesting that the volcanic rocks\nof the Kiirunavaara Group are at least as old as 2100 Ma.\nFig. 12.

(2007) argued that zircon U^Pb ages in the\nregion of Kiirunavaara may represent resetting, either by\nvolume diffusion because of the small grain size of zircon\nrelative to titanite, or by dissolution^reprecipitation\ncaused by the extreme fluid conditions in the environment\nof the Kiirunavaara ore bodies. Martinsson (2004) sug-\ngested that the chemistry of the Porphyrite Group is con-\nsistent with an early Svecokarelian arc environment,\nwhereas the Kiirunavaara Group was interpreted as a\nbimodal suite linked to within-plate volcanism. We there-\nfore interpret the titanite cores from Luossavaara,\nGruvberget and Malmberget to indicate a minimum for-\nmation age for the Porphyrite and Kiirunavaara groups\npre-2\u00b705 Ga, relating either to early arc formation or to\nbimodal magmatism (Nironen, 1997; Martinsson, 2004;\nWiehed et al., 2005; Fig. 17).

This is close in time to, although\nslightly older than, the timing of Fe oxide^apatite mineral-\nization in the Luossavaara^Kiirunavaara system\n[1884\u0002 6 to 1875\u00029 Ma, Romer et al.

This age range overlaps with the\nintrusion of the Haparanda and Perthite-monzonite suite\ngranitoids in the Norrbotten region and the initial period\nof IOCG-type mineralization (Billstro\u00ab m & Martinsson,\n2000; Bergman et al., 2001). Data from later-stage titanite\nin the hanging wall breccia at Kiirunavaara also overlap\nwith this time period, but indicate secondary modification\nof titanite resulting in a spread of ages along concordia as\na result of metamorphism or secondary hydrothermal\nmodification. Cliff & Rickard (1992) suggested that sul-\nphide alteration at Kiruna was the result of a late hydro-\nthermal event, dated at \u00041\u00b75 Ga using whole-rock Pb^Pb,\nRb^Sr and Sm^Nd data. Both Cliff & Rickard (1992)\nand Romer et al.

KIRUNA DISTRICT MINERALIZATION\n23\nmetamorphism of the Kiruna area without the develop-\nment of penetrative deformation has been noted by a\nnumber of previous workers (e.g. Nystro\u00ab m & Henr|\u00a4quez,\n1994).\nTitanite from the regional scapolite^albite alteration\nexposed at Nunasvaara indicates an age of 1903\u00028 Ma.\nThis is indistinguishable from the earliest ages at\nMalmberget and close to the earliest possible ages at\nKiirunavaara and Luossavaara. This is significant, as in\nother IOCG provinces regional scapolite alteration has\nbeen proposed to be a distributed metal leaching event\nwhich led to the formation of Fe mineralization in structur-\nally focused discharge zones (Barton & Johnson, 1996,\n2000; Oliver et al., 2004). A similar model may apply here,\nbut requires more detailed mass-balance studies and a\nmore extensive geochronological study of the regional\nNa^Ca alteration.\nThe age of 1854\u000218 Ma from allanite at Rakkurija\u00ab rvi\noverlaps with the age of Fe oxide^apatite mineralization\nand the early IOCG group identified by Billstro\u00ab m &\nMartinsson (2000), and suggests at least a temporal link\nbetween the two.The cumulative probability plots indicate\nthat this represents relatively undisturbed isotope systema-\ntics and hence indicates the age of alteration, in good\nagreement with Re^Os sulphide mineralization ages of\n1853\u00026 Ma and 1862\u00026 Ma (Smith et al., 2007). The\ndata from titanite are consistent with its metamorphic\nmodification by Pb loss or dissolution^reprecipitation at\naround 1780 Ma. The data from Kallosalmi are also con-\nsistent with metamorphic or metasomatic resetting of tita-\nnite formed in the period 1850^1870 Ma at 1750^1780 Ma\n(Fig. 8). Data from Gruvberget (1820\u000210 Ma) show little\nspread along concordia and are interpreted as consistent\nwith mineralization at \u00041820 Ma. This is younger than\nFig. 15.

The early Fe-oxide^apatite mineralization\nat Gruvberget may be of a similar age, or may be older.\nThe data from titanite and allanite at Nautanen overlap\nwith the younger (1800^1750 Ma) group of IOCG-type\ndeposits identified by Billstro\u00ab m & Martinsson (2000) and\nare in agreement with the detailed study of the nearby\nAitik deposit byWanhainen et al. (2005), which recognized\nan initial, possibly porphyry-Cu style, mineralization con-\nstrained to be within the period 1876\u000210 Ma to 1848\u0002 8\nMa, overprinted by a more complex alteration assemblage\nat some time around 1780 Ma. The later stage is also rec-\norded at Nautanen and appears to represent a thermal\nevent(s) related to fluid flow along the NDZ and associated\nstructures.\nThe time constraints currently available bracket differ-\nent stages of mineralization, but are currently very broad\nas the complex geological history has resulted in variable\nresetting of the isotope systematics of a range of phases.\nMore precise analytical techniques (TIMS) do not resolve\nthis issue, as previous studies have averaged some of the\nintracrystalline variation seen in this study and given by\nStorey et al. (2007). Overall the data presented here are\nconsistent with regional scapolite alteration in the period\n1911^1895 Ma, although this is constrained by only a\nsingle sample. Iron oxide^apatite mineralization took\nplace at some point in the period 1920^1870 Ma, and was\noverprinted by later fluid flow events; these were probably\nresponsible for sulphide mineralization, which resulted in\nsome resetting of earlier formed titanite within the period\n1870^1830 Ma. There is evidence for mineralizing events\ndown to 1820\u000210 Ma. Most of the deposits studied pre-\nserve evidence of a thermal metamorphic event within the\nperiod 1750^1780 Ma. For deposits within the NDZ titanite\nand allanite grains were either completely reset, or initially\ncrystallized, within this period, probably during move-\nment and fluid flow along the shear zone. This period cor-\nresponds to the 1770^1800 Ma late Svecofennian\ndeformation and metamorphism identified by Bergman\net al. (2001) and current constraints on the intrusion\nperiod of the Lina suite granitoids (Skio\u00ab ld, 1988). In\nmodels of the tectonic evolution of the Svecofennian this\nperiod also brackets the post-accretion transition from\nintra-cratonic transpression to orogenic collapse, which\nmay have caused reactivation of existing structures\n(Nironen, 1997;Weihed et al., 2005; Fig. 17).\nTrace element characteristics of titanite\nand allanite\nThe trace element patterns of hydrothermal minerals can\nbe affected by the composition of the metal source, equilib-\nrium mineral^fluid partitioning (McIntire, 1963), the\nligand chemistry of the hydrothermal fluid (Haas et al.,\n1995), and the kinetics of mineral growth and dissolution\n(Mo\u00ab ller, 1998). They can also be affected by the redistribu-\ntion of the REE between phases, with or without bulk\naddition or leaching of the REE, during metamorphism\nor metasomatism. In this study, except for variations in\ntrace element patterns between clearly distinct stages of\ncrystal growth, intracrystalline variations in trace element\nchemistry are minor compared with variations between\ndeposits, suggesting that kinetic factors were of limited\nimportance. Diffusive rehomogenization of titanite trace\nelement patterns on geologically realistic time scales is\nextremely unlikely at temperatures below 8008C\n(Cherniak, 1995). The grains studied therefore probably\npreserve the original variation in trace element chemistry,\nexcept in the case of rehomogenization by dissolution^\nreprecipitation processes.

Purely on\nthe basis of spatial accommodation into the titanite lattice\nthis would suggest that, in the absence of fluid speciation\ncontrol, titanite^aqueous fluid partitioning should lead to\npreferential incorporation of the middle REE (MREE)\ninto titanite, with relatively low La contents relative to\nCe. These considerations account for a number of the fea-\ntures of the REE patterns observed in titanites from this\nstudy. Of the other trace elements analysed in this study\nmost bivalent ions will also substitute onto the Ca-site\n(including Cu, Mn, Sr) as will U and Th. Other tetrava-\nlent, or higher oxidation state cations (e.g. Zr, Nb, Ta)\nwill usually substitute forTi4\u00fe (Ribbe, 1980).\nThe trace element patterns in titanite cores from\nLuossavaara and Gruvberget are consistent with these par-\ntitioning constraints and suggest crystal chemically con-\ntrolled REE partitioning during metamorphic formation\nof titanite (Storey et al., 2007). The titanites studied here\nare strongly LREE enriched relative to these grain cores.\nBulk-rock data from unmetasomatized equivalents distal\nfrom the ore bodies is lacking in most of the examples stud-\nied here, but metasomatic addition of the REE and other\ntrace elements, hosted by apatite, titanite and allanite, has\nbeen demonstrated at Tj\u0002rraj\u0002kka (Edfelt et al., 2005).\nThis mechanism is favoured here as in at least one example\n(KR1) titanite is vein hosted, and therefore the trace ele-\nment content must represent REE transported in a hydro-\nthermal fluid. The REE patterns of titanite are also\nsimilar to those reported from apatite from the same or\nsimilar deposits (Frietsch & Perdahl, 1995; Harlov et al.,\n2002; Edfelt et al., 2007; Fig. 16). Studies of coexisting apa-\ntite and titanite in the literature suggest that equilibrium\npartitioning should result in apatite with LREE enrich-\nment relative to titanite (Henderson, 1980), and so the sim-\nilarity in chemistry suggests external fluid control.\nThe rims of titanite at Luossavaara (Storey et al., 2007)\nand grains from Kiirunavaara are LREE enriched, and\nhave low U\/Th ratios and high Zr and Nb concentrations.\nThe latter characteristics might argue strongly for the\nmagmatic origin of the titanites in the Kiruna deposit, as\nthese elements are generally considered to be immobile,\nor at least conserved, in hydrothermal systems. However,\nboth samples are hydrothermal in setting, and both show\nanomalous behaviour of Y relative to Dy and Ho. This is\nconsistent with the influence of aqueous speciation on\nREE chemistry, and in particular the formation of M3\u00fe^\nF complexes (Bau, 1996). The high Zr and Nb in titanite\nfrom different stages of the Kiruna system indicates that\nthese elements were mobilized in the hydrothermal\nphase (e.g. Giere\u00a4 , 1986; Salvi & Williams-Jones, 1990,\n1996). The high-temperature conditions and extreme sali-\nnities of fluids in all deposits may have promoted HFSE\nmobilization as aqueous chloride complexes; high F activ-\nities may also significantly enhance the solubility of\nHFSE, including Zr and Nb in hydrothermal solutions\n(e.g. Giere\u00a4 , 1990; Rubin et al., 1993; Gagnon et al., 2004;\nSmith, 2007). Apatites from Fe oxide^apatite deposits are\nnotably enriched in F relative to Cl, whereas those from\nIOCG-type mineralization are typically Cl-rich (Frietsch\n& Perdahl, 1995; Edfelt et al., 2005, 2007). This indicates\nhigher HF activities in Fe oxide^apatite deposit related\nfluids (Korzhinskiy, 1981). High HF activity in Fe oxide^\napatite mineralizing fluids may also account for the\nLREE enrichment of associated titanite, as aqueous\nLREE^F complexes are more stable at high P^T than\nthose of the HREE (Haas et al., 1995). Titanite from\nMalmberget is LREE depleted relative to that from\nKiirunavaara. This may result from dissolution^\nreprecipitation of titanite during metamorphism, as\nthe LREE may be preferentially lost to the fluid during\nsuch a process. Harlov et al. (2002) noted LREE-depleted-\nzones in apatite from Kiirunavaara surrounding\nmonazite inclusions formed during greenschist-facies\nmetamorphism.\nWithin the IOCG deposits, those Porphyrite,\nKiirunavaara and Greenstone group hosted deposits in\nthe general area of Kiruna are similar in terms of their\nLREE enrichment, but show distinct negative Yanomalies\n(Fig. 16b). The titanite from regional Na^Cl altered rocks\nat Nunasvaara has similar characteristics to those from\nthe undeformed IOCG deposits. Overall the REE patterns\nsuggest a similar REE source for the Fe-oxide^apatite\ndeposits and the non-NDZ Cu^Au deposits (Fig. 16). Both\nthe granitoid suites and intermediate to acid host rocks for\nthe deposits are relatively LREE enriched (e.g. Blake,\n1990; Lundmark et al., 2005; Wanhainen et al., 2006), and\nhence REE could have been derived either from the grani-\ntoids or from the intermediate to acid volcanic rocks of\nthe district. The highly saline characteristics of mineraliz-\ning fluids in the IOCG deposits (e.g. Lindblom et al., 1996)\nand the evidence from apatite composition for a lower HF\nactivity in these fluids relative to the Fe oxide^apatite\ndeposit related fluids means that Cl-complexes are likely\nto have dominated aqueous REE species. Chloride com-\nplexation would have had only a minor fractionating\neffect on REE patterns during extraction from a source\nrock (Haas et al.,1995), without enhancingY solubility rela-\ntive to Dy and Ho.\nTitanites from the NDZ hosted deposits are markedly\ndepleted in the LREE relative to the other deposits stud-\nied. This could be consistent either with co-precipitation\nof a particularly LREE-enriched phase, or with alteration\nsubsequently resulting in either leaching of the REE or\nthe partial replacement of titanite by LREE-enriched\nSMITH et al. KIRUNA DISTRICT MINERALIZATION\n27\nphases (see Harlov et al., 2002). However, REE mineral\ninclusions are absent in Nautanen titanite. Allanite from\nthe same samples is also LREE-depleted relative to other\ndeposit types. In this instance an alternative source for\nthe REE is likely. Gabbro and diorite of both the\nHaparanda and Perthite-monzonite suites are common in\nthe Nautanen to Aitik area, and the synform marginal to\nthe NDZ at Nautanen is cored by metabasalt of the\nPorphyrite Group (Bergman et al., 2001). Such an interpre-\ntation is supported by the elevated Ni and lowTh contents\nof the Nautanen and Aitik titanites.\nImplications for IOCG-type mineralization\nThe tectonic environment of IOCG mineralization is vari-\nable. Hitzman (2000) suggested that IOCG-type mineral-\nization could be linked to cratonic or continental margin\nenvironments, associated with orogenic collapse, anoro-\ngenic magmatism and subduction, whereas Barton &\nJohnson (1996) included arc systems, failed continental\nrifts and active rifts, and stable platforms associated with\nhotspot volcanism, but noted a suggestion of anorogenic\nor rift-related origin. This study, linked with previous\nwork on the Norrbotten Fe oxide and IOCG district,\ndemonstrates that both magnetite^apatite deposits and\nIOCG-type deposits were generated relatively early in the\nSvecofennian tectonic cycle during subduction and accre-\ntion, but either they were modified or there were repeated\nperiods of mineralization through collision to orogenic col-\nlapse (Fig. 17). The geochronological data presented here\nare not consistent with the interpretation of the magnetite^\napatite bodies forming as melts consanguinous with their\nhost volcanic rocks, with temporally continuous, hydro-\nthermal modification (Lundberg & Smellie, 1979;\nNystro\u00ab m, 1985). The clear inference of an epigenetic origin\nfor the main phase of magnetite^apatite orebody forma-\ntion and the anomalies introduced into the REE patterns\nby the effects of aqueous complex formation all argue for\na hydrothermal metasomatic origin.\nInitial IOCG and Fe oxide^apatite mineralization was\ntemporally associated with Haparanda and Perthite-\nmonzonite suite calc-alkaline magmatism. Subsequent\nmineralization in post-1800 Ma IOCGs, associated with\nmajor deformation zones, has LREE-depleted trace ele-\nment patterns, suggesting either redistribution of trace ele-\nments during metamorphism or a source for the REE and\npossibly other metals in the volcanic rocks of the region.\nPreliminary dating from a single sample of regional scapo-\nlite^albite altered rock suggests that regional alteration\noccurred within the period 1912^1895 Ma, corresponding\nto the initial phase of Fe oxide^apatite mineralization.\nHowever, more extensive studies of this alteration are a\nclear prerequisite for further development of this\ninterpretation.\nModels for IOCG mineralization are variable, but\nmany researchers now agree that regional or large-scale\nalbitization or scapolitization released metals to the hydro-\nthermal fluid, resulting in subsequent mineralization in\nboth barren and Cu^Au mineralized magnetite\/hematite^\napatite ironstones (e.g. Barton & Johnson, 2000; Oliver\net al., 2004). The ultimate source of the fluids is currently a\nmatter of debate, as different tracer techniques indicate a\nwide range of fluid component sources. Pollard (2006) pro-\nposed that separation of a fluid phase from calc-alkaline\nmagmas at greater depths than seen in porphyry Cu sys-\ntems, as a result of higher CO2 contents, resulted in the\ncirculation of brines along major tectonic structures.\nConversely, Barton & Johnson (1996, 2000) pointed to a\nrange of geochemical features favouring non-magmatic\nbrines, sourced from either saline surface waters or the\ninteraction of fluids with evaporites, and developed mass-\nbalance arguments suggesting that magmatic fluids could\nnot be responsible for the scale of regional Na-alteration.\nThe data presented here could be consistent with either\nmodel, or indicate different sources of fluid components\nduring the extended and geologically complex history of\nthe deposits. The geochronological data are consistent\nwith a separation in time between Fe oxide^apatite and\nsulphide mineralization, followed by subsequent alteration\nof the ores during structurally focused metamorphic fluid\nflow, whereas the trace element data suggest leaching of\nmetals from both the metavolcanic sequence and the regio-\nnal granitoids. Meta-evaporite units have been inferred in\nthe Greenstone Group sequence (Frietsch et al., 1997) and\nhence highly saline non-magmatic brines cannot be\nexcluded from models on the basis of the data presented\nhere. On the basis of high mineralization temperatures\nand the oxygen isotope composition of quartz, Lindblom\net al. (1996) favoured a magmatic fluid source at\nPahtohavare. Frietsch et al. (1995) concluded that sulfur in\na range of deposits was derived from both bacterial sulfate\nreduction and magmatic sources. At present we favour\nmodels of hydrothermal genesis for both Fe-oxide and\nCu^Au deposits, with Cu^Au mineralization post-dating\nand overprinting Fe-mineralization, and some metal com-\nponents of the fluids being derived from local granitoid\nrocks. The ultimate source of the fluids and dissolved com-\nponents is yet to be fully constrained.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe application of spatially constrained LA-ICP-MS to U^\nPb analysis has, for the first time, clearly indicated the\nmultistage evolution of titanite from a range of settings in\nthe Norrbotten District, Northern Sweden. The age of the\nvolcanic sequence hosting several major ore deposits and\nmany prospects has been demonstrated to be greater than\n2050 Ma and a product of magmatism pre-dating the\nSvecokarelian orogeny. The iron oxide^apatite deposits,\nJOURNAL OF PETROLOGY VOLUME 00 NUMBER 0 MONTH 2009\n28\nfor which the region is famous, formed in the period 1920^\n1860 Ma, overlapping with preliminary constraints on the\nage of regional sodic alteration, although further data on\nthe timing of alteration are necessary to confirm this. An\ninitial phase of iron oxide^copper^gold (IOCG) mineral-\nization temporally overlaps with later stages of this pro-\ncess, within the errors of the data presented here, and\ncorresponds to the 1880^1860 Ma phase of mineralization\nidentified by Billstro\u00ab m & Martinsson (2000). Many depos-\nits yield titanite U^Pb ages as late as 1820 and 1790 Ma,\nbut strong evidence of lead loss either by dissolution^repre-\ncipitation or possibly by diffusion suggests that U^Pb ages\nin this range may represent metamorphism during subse-\nquent thermal events during the Svecokarelian orogeny.\nWell-constrained, concordant ages in the range 1800^1750\nMa have been obtained from titanite from the Nautanen\nprospect. Coupled with previous data from the Aitik\ndeposit (Wanhainen et al., 2005) this suggests significant\nreworking of the initial phase of mineralization alongside\nfurther fluid flow episodes along major structural features.\nThe strongly deformed deposits at Malmberget give U^\nPb ages extending along concordia over the whole time\nperiod and indicate either strong metamorphism at \u00041750\nMa or repeated thermal events causing Pb loss from tita-\nnite over the whole orogenic cycle.\nThe trace element chemistry of the analysed titanite is\ndistinct for all the phases of mineralization described\nabove. The LREE-enriched nature of the titanites suggests\na metal source either in the intermediate to acid host\nrocks or in the Svecofennian granitoids of the Haparanda\nand Perthite-monzonite suites. Minor features of the trace\nelement patterns, such as Y anomalies relative to Dy and\nHo, are consistent with a hydrothermal origin for all the\ntitanites studied. Trace element patterns from the\nNautanen prospect and Aitik are markedly LREE\ndepleted and may be consistent with a more local trace ele-\nment source via leaching of metals during alteration of\nmeta-volcanic rocks, or loss of the LREE during metamor-\nphic recrystallization.\nOverall the data presented here are consistent with\nemerging models of IOCG-type mineralization during\nsubduction and continental accretion whereby fluids are\nchannelled along major crustal structures, resulting in\nregionally extensive alteration, and mineralization focused\nin structurally controlled fluid discharge zones. The ulti-\nmate source of such fluids is not constrained by this study.\nDifferent mechanisms and different fluid sources may\nhave operated at different times, as there is a distinction\nin age between Fe oxide^apatite deposits and sulphide-\nrelated Cu^Au mineralization. However, on the basis of\ncurrent constraints, iron oxide^apatite deposits show some\noverlap in time with IOCG mineralization, and hence\nthey may have some commonalities in the mechanism of\ndeposit genesis.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe would like to thank Olaf Martinsson for advice on\nsampling sites.
