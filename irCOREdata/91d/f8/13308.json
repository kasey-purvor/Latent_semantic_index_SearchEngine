However, there are some important differences. Deci and Ryan suggest a continuum of motivation ranging from amotivation over extrinsic motivation to intrinsic motivation, differentiating six regulatory styles: non-regulation (indicative of amotivation), external, introjected, identified, and integrated regulation (indicative of extrinsic motivation in ascending order of their degree of internality), and intrinsic regulation (indicative of intrinsic motivation). Consequently, Deci and Ryan\u2019s model regards identified regulation as indicative of extrinsic motivation. In contrast, Sheldon and Elliot\u2019s model regards identified reasons as indicative of autonomous motivation.

The present study investigated the relationships between harmonious and obsessive passion for studying and academic engagement (vigor, dedication, and absorption) and burnout (exhaustion, cynicism, and inefficacy) in 105 university students, controlling for the effects of autonomous and controlled motivation. Both harmonious and obsessive passion explained variance in academic engagement and burnout beyond autonomous and controlled motivation: harmonious passion predicted higher dedication and lower cynicism, obsessive passion predicted higher absorption, and both harmonious and obsessive passion predicted higher vigor and lower inefficacy. The findings suggest that passion for studying explains individual differences in students\u2019 academic engagement and burnout beyond autonomous and controlled motivation and thus deserves more attention from educational psychology.<\/dc:description><dc:format>application\/pdf<\/dc:format><dc:identifier>http:\/\/kar.kent.ac.uk\/27520\/1\/Stoeber%20Childs%20Hayward%20Feast%20%282011%29%20EP.pdf<\/dc:identifier><dc:language>en<\/dc:language><dc:source>0144-3410<\/dc:source><dc:subject>BF<\/dc:subject><dc:title>Passion and motivation for studying: Predicting academic engagement and burnout in university students<\/dc:title><rioxxterms:apc>unknown<\/rioxxterms:apc><rioxxterms:author>Stoeber, Joachim<\/rioxxterms:author><rioxxterms:author>Childs, Julian H.<\/rioxxterms:author><rioxxterms:author>Hayward, Jennifer A.<\/rioxxterms:author><rioxxterms:author>Feast, Alexandra R.<\/rioxxterms:author><rioxxterms:project funder_name=\"notused\" >notused<\/rioxxterms:project><rioxxterms:publication_date>2011<\/rioxxterms:publication_date><rioxxterms:type>Journal Article\/Review<\/rioxxterms:type><rioxxterms:version>VoR<\/rioxxterms:version><rioxxterms:version_of_record>http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1080\/01443410.2011.570251<\/rioxxterms:version_of_record><\/rioxx><\/metadata><\/record>","journals":null,"language":{"code":"en","id":9,"name":"English"},"relations":[],"year":2011,"topics":["BF"],"subject":["BF"],"fullText":""}
