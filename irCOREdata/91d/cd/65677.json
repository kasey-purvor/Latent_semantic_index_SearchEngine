(see pages 1106 and 1111)\nT\nhe publication in the Lancet of the\nEuropean Concerted Action on sud-\nden infant death syndrome (SIDS)\n(ECAS study)1 resulted in front page\nheadlines such as \u2018\u2018Don\u2019t sleep with\nyour baby\u2019\u2019 (Daily Telegraph: D\nDerbyshire, Science Correspondent, 16\nJanuary 2004). Yet the ECAS study said\nnothing new about bed-sharing and cot\ndeath: both the CESDI study\n(Confidential Enquiry into Stillbirth\nand Death in Infancy),2 data from New\nZealand,3 and work from Ireland4 have\nsuperficially come to similar conclu-\nsions. Is the quality of evidence such\nthat paediatricians, midwives, and\nhealth visitors should reasonably dis-\nsuade mothers from bed-sharing or co-\nsleeping, or is there more to it than that?\nFirst, we must question the validity\nof extrapolating health messages from\ncase controlled data sets. Bradford-Hill\nsuggested robust criteria (temporal rela-\ntionship, specificity, biological plausibil-\nity, coherence; others would add dose\nresponse) for inferring causality from\nassociative data when prospective ran-\ndomised trials are impossible.5 It took\nsome time before these criteria were\nsatisfied to such an extent that the\nsuccessful \u2018\u2018back to sleep\u2019\u2019 campaign\ncould be accepted as public policy. That\nsuccess should not seduce us into\naccepting a lower standard of evidence\nof causality for some \u2018\u2018new\u2019\u2019 hypotheti-\ncal risk factor. Arguably, now that we\nhave good reason to promote supine\nsleeping, an appropriate thermal envir-\nonment, and the avoidance of cigarette\nsmoke, the benefit of any further\nmessage on reducing the risk of SIDS\nis likely to be marginal at best.\nSecond, there is a general lack of\nunderstanding about the heterogeneity\nof bed-sharing in particular, and infant\nsleep environments in general, in the data\ncollection and analyses of case control\nstudies. These can seriously undermine\nresults such as that from ECAS. The\ndefinitions of infant sleep conditions\nused in the majority of these studies do\nnot necessarily reflect the reality of infant\nsleep environments as experienced by the\nparents and infants. Not all studies have\nallowed for the use of alcohol or other\ndrugs, nor have they all distinguished\nmanifestly unsafe sleeping environments\nsuch as co-sleeping on sofas. It is impor-\ntant to separate sleeping with mother\nalone, with mother and father, with\nfather alone, in a bed with another child\n(either with or without an adult), or an\nunrelated adult sleeping with the infant.\nIt is also important that studies distin-\nguish bed-sharing to facilitate breast\nfeeding; and bed-sharing that is habi-\ntual as opposed to occasional; because\nthese states have major physiological\ndifferences.\nThird, in some of the studies (not the\nCESDI one) the definition of bed-sharing\nincluded babies who spent part of the\nnight in the bed but were put back\nelsewhere before being found dead, and\nsome who bed-shared for part of the\nsleep, but were found in the adult bed\nalone\u2014either before the adult came to\nbed, or after the adult got up. In these\ncircumstances the death cannot reason-\nably be attributed to the presence of an\nadult. Intermittent bed-sharing may only\noccur when infants are brought into the\nbed when \u2018\u2018mardy\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018twisty\u2019\u2019, and these\ninfant behaviours may be a marker for an\ninfection or other illness.6 When this\nillness is fatal on the only night of bed-\nsharing it creates a coincidence which in\nlarge case control studies marks the bed-\nsharing as a \u2018\u2018risk factor\u2019\u2019, if no differ-\nentiation is made between habitual and\nintermittent bed-sharing, or the reasons\nfor the bed-sharing are not adequately\nascertained. It also raises important ques-\ntions about the vulnerability of individual\ninfants which may make them succumb\nto an apparently minor infection from\nwhich other normal infants will emerge\nunscathed.\nThe only analysis to date that has\nattempted this level of sophistication\nwas that derived from the CESDI\/SUDI\nstudy,7 which found that for non-smo-\nkers the apparent association with bed-\nsharing was explained by other factors\nthan the practice of bed-sharing itself.\nUnfortunately, its conclusions are being\novershadowed by more recent studies\nwith less robust data sets.\nIn contrast to the generally negative\nstance of these epidemiological investiga-\ntions, all of which focus on infant death\nrather than infant health, we argue that\nthere is much to be said for bringing a\nbaby into the adult bed in certain cir-\ncumstances. We suggest that bed-sharing\nhas been a soft target for SIDS campaign-\ners because it seems to involve a straight-\nforward parental choice in that there\nis no apparent harm from the alternative\narrangement of solitary sleeping. But no\nparent-child behaviour is free of cost and\nbenefit, and unqualified advice against\nbed-sharing might well result in an\nincrease in other, more hazardous beha-\nviours. For instance, faced with official\ndisapproval of bed-sharing, mothers\nmight choose to feed at night on a sofa,\nand fall asleep there with their baby; yet\nthis environment appears to be by far the\nmost unsafe for co-sleeping. We therefore\nchallenge on several grounds the assump-\ntion that solitary infant sleeping is some-\nhow optimal, when in worldwide and\nevolutionary terms it has not been the\nnorm.\nFirst, non-human primate mothers\ngenerally maintain intimate contact with\ntheir infants in the immediate postpar-\ntum period and for the first few weeks,\nboth waking and sleeping, and so do\nhuman mothers in many cultures today.8\nEven in the developed world, mother\u2013\ninfant bed-sharing is a common strategy\nfor night-time care giving in the early\nmonths of an infant\u2019s life, particularly for\nbreast fed babies.6 9 It is common among\nnew parents following discharge from\nhospital, and is more prevalent among\nneonates than older infants.10\nSecond, there is now an increasing\nbody of evidence relating to the beha-\nviour and physiology of bed-sharing\nthat has been obtained both in sleep\nlaboratories and the home environ-\nment.11 12 These studies have shown that\nbed-sharing is associated with longer\nand more restful maternal and infant\nsleep,13 and with successful breast feed-\ning.14 Babies who sleep with their\n1082 PERSPECTIVES\nwww.archdischild.com\n on 5 November 2009 adc.bmj.comDownloaded from \nmothers feed more frequently (thus\nstimulating the milk supply), and are\nmore likely to breast feed for longer\nthan those babies who breast feed\nwithout bed-sharing.9 Babies sleeping\nhabitually with parents are more rou-\nsable and may be more easily recognised\nas being unwell because of their proxi-\nmity to mother.12 Likewise, breast feed-\ning mothers bed-sharing with their\nbabies tend to sleep more lightly and\nare more rousable in the presence of\ntheir infant than are mothers who rarely\nor never bed-share.15 This emphasises\nthe importance of breast feeding in\nrelation to bed-sharing, and highlights\nthe difference between habitual and\noccasional bed-sharing, which holds\nwhether or not there is breast feeding.\nThird, we have observed that mothers\ninstinctively take up a protective posture\nwhen sharing a bed with their infants,\nlying in a fetal position with their lower\narm above the infant\u2019s head and the\ninfant lying within around 20\u201330 cm\nfrom the mother\u2019s chest. The position of\nthe mother\u2019s thighs prevents the baby\nfrom sliding down the bed. An extra-\nordinary range of dyadic behaviours can\nbe observed: the infant and mother start\nto synchronise their sleep states; move\ntowards each other or away from each\nother as dictated by temperature (and\nbabies demonstrably do not overheat in\nthis situation); breast feeding can take\nplace without either party being techni-\ncally awake; and both parties touch each\nother, particularly the mother touching\nthe baby. It is clear from the work so\nfar that we are only just beginning to\nunravel the complexities of bed-sharing\nbehaviour, and that without such an\nunderstanding, simplistic descriptions\nsuch as \u2018\u2018safe\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018hazardous\u2019\u2019 are\nmeaningless.\nThe story of the role of health profes-\nsionals in prone and supine sleeping was\na classical contrast of hubris and nemesis:\nthe well intentioned promotion of a\nbehaviour based on extrapolation from\nthe physiology of preterm babies, but an\noutcome that, with hindsight, caused\nunknown numbers of unnecessary infant\ndeaths across the developed world. We\ncannot afford not to learn from our recent\nhistory. We must also be careful about\nusing the \u2018\u2018risk\u2019\u2019 of an intrinsically highly\nunlikely event, that of unexplained sud-\nden infant death, as a lever for modifying\nmaternal behaviour: in any case, just\nsaying \u2018\u2018don\u2019t do it\u2019\u2019 is ineffective in\nchanging anyone\u2019s behaviour. Since the\nadvantages of breast feeding have an\nevidence base that does not feature the\nrisk of cot death at all, and our under-\nstanding of the interrelationship between\nbed-sharing and breast feeding is still\nquite primitive, we should be very reticent\nabout taking a view on the safety or\notherwise of bed-sharing until we under-\nstand a great deal more about it.\nArch Dis Child 2004;89:1082\u20131083.\ndoi: 10.1136\/adc.2004.054312\nAuthors\u2019 affiliations\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nM Wailoo, Consultant Paediatrician and\nSenior Lecturer in Child Health, Department of\nChild Health, University of Leicester, Clinical\nSciences Building, Leicester Royal Infirmary,\nLeicester LE2 7LX, UK\nH Ball, Senior Lecturer in Anthropology,\nParent-Infant Sleep Lab, Department of\nAnthropology, University of Durham, 43 Old\nElvet, Durham DH1 3HN, UK\nP Fleming, Professor of Infant Health and\nDevelopmental Physiology, Institute of Child\nHealth, Bristol Royal Hospital for Children,\nBristol BS2 8AE, UK\nM W Platt, Consultant Paediatrician & Senior\nLecturer in Child Health, Royal Victoria\nInfirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne NE1 4LP, UK\nCorrespondence to: Dr M Wailoo, Consultant\nPaediatrician and Senior Lecturer in Child\nHealth, Department of Child Health, University\nof Leicester, Clinical Sciences Building, Leicester\nRoyal Infirmary, Leicester LE2 7LX, UK; mw33@\nle.ac.uk\nREFERENCES\n1 Carpenter RG, Irgens LM, Blair PS, et al.
