Introduction\nAmmonia (NH3) is a trace gas primarily emitted from agricultural practices. Intensive \nrearing of poultry and animals leads to large point sources of NH3 emission which can \ncause direct effects on sensitive vegetation (Cape, et al., 2008, Leith, et al., 2005, \nPitcairn, et al., 2003) and lead to deposition of large amounts of nitrogen (N) \ndownwind. Although it is relatively simple to measure the air concentrations of NH3 by \nusing passive diffusion samplers (Tang, et al., 2001), it is difficult to estimate the \nconsequent dry deposition to the surface downwind, although such deposition is likely \nto be important in influencing ecological responses to the additional N, and may greatly \nexceed the wet deposition of N (Pitcairn, et al., 2002). Control of NH3 emissions may \nbe required where N deposition exceeds the Critical Load for ecosystems influenced by \nlarge point sources. However, simple attempts to estimate dry deposition from the \nmeasured concentrations take no account of the possible effects of high NH3 \nconcentrations on the dry deposition process; direct measurements of NH3 dry \ndeposition fluxes have usually been made where air concentrations are (relatively) low \n(< 10 \u03bcg m-3) and varying slowly with distance, e.g.(Erisman and Wyers, 1993, \nFlechard and Fowler, 1998, Rattray and Sievering, 2001, Sutton, et al., 1995, Sutton, et \nal., 1993a, Sutton, et al., 2000). The deposition of N is not well characterised.in the \nvicinity of large point sources such as poultry or pig farms, where measured average \nNH3 concentrations may be up to 60 \u03bcg m-3 (Pitcairn, et al., 2002), and hourly \nconcentrations very much greater. \nEstimates of the dry deposition of airborne gases and particles to the earth\u2019s surface are \noften made using an inferential method, whereby the air concentration (measured at a \ngiven height (z) above the surface) is multiplied by an appropriate height-referenced \ndeposition velocity (vd(z)) to give the deposition flux. For gases such as ozone, which \nare not emitted at the surface, the direction is downwards, and the deposition velocity \ncan be estimated based on the measured or estimated turbulence of the atmosphere and \nthe characteristics of the absorbing surface. Parameterisations of vd are used, separating \nthe different components of the overall transfer resistance (Rt = 1\/vd) into \n\u2018aerodynamic\u2019, \u2018boundary layer\u2019 and \u2018surface\u2019 terms. The deposition velocity is then \nexpressed as: vd(z) = 1\/Rt(z), where Rt(z) = Ra(z) + Rb + Rc is the sum of the \naerodynamic, boundary-layer and surface terms, respectively. Appropriate values for \nRa(z) can be estimated from vertical gradients in wind speed measured at the site, or \nfrom wind speed and surface roughness measurements, and Rb can be estimated for a \nparticular surface vegetation type from measured wind speed. Rc can be parameterised \nin terms of vegetation type, stomatal opening, surface wetness, or any other factor \nwhich influences the reaction\/deposition of the gas or particle of interest at the surface. \nIn its simplest formulation, the value of Rc is assumed to be independent of air \nconcentrations. However, for some gases the surface may be a source as well as a sink, \ndepending on the physical and physiological state of the vegetation, the wetness of the \nvegetation or soil surface, or the air concentration. Ammonia shows bi-directional \ntransport (Sutton, et al., 1993b), which can be expressed in terms of an internal leaf \nconcentration of ammonia which is in dynamic equilibrium with the air concentration; \nif air concentrations are greater than the equivalent leaf concentration then deposition \noccurs, but if the equivalent leaf concentration is greater than the air concentration, then \nthe surface acts as a source rather than a sink.\nThe complexity of estimating ammonia deposition rates is further complicated by two \nother processes: (1) the surface sink for ammonia (i.e. to the outside of leaves rather \nthan through stomata) has been shown to saturate at high concentrations, i.e. the surface \nresistance increases as concentrations increase (Jones, et al., 2007); and (2) the surface \nresistance depends upon the presence of acidic gases such as sulphur dioxide (SO2) or \nnitric acid (HNO3), which can effectively lower the surface resistance through chemical \nreaction with the deposited ammonia gas to form salts (Flechard, et al., 1999).\nSuch complexity makes it very difficult to estimate the dry deposition of ammonia to \nthe landscape, particularly where there are many different plant species forming a \nvarying canopy structure, where the different elements of the landscape may be sinks or \nsources, and where conditions of surface wetness or the presence of acidic gases cause \nlarge temporal variations in surface resistance. Some of the same problems occur in \nfield experiments, where although the air concentrations of ammonia may be measured, \nand the absorbing vegetation surface may be well characterised, the long-term \ndeposition of ammonia is not simply estimated.\nThe objective of this paper is to take the detailed chamber measurements of the \ndependence of deposition rate on NH3 concentration under controlled conditions (Jones, \net al., 2007) and apply them to the field conditions of an open-air fumigation \nexperiment over an ombrotrophic bog, in order to calculate the dry deposition of \nammonia over the full range of measured NH3 concentrations. The Whim bog nitrogen \nmanipulation experiment in south-east Scotland is a unique field experiment comparing \nthe effects of different forms of airborne nitrogen on an unmanaged ombrotrophic bog. \nThe experiment (Leith, et al., 2004, Sheppard, et al., 2004) includes controlled \nadditions of ammonium or nitrate in precipitation at 3 different levels of N deposition \n(some +\/- potassium and phosphorus), and a gradient exposure to NH3 gas. Ammonia is \nreleased from a cylinder of pure NH3 gas into a 10 m x 0.2 m diameter perforated pipe \nwhen the wind direction is between 180 and 215\u00b0 from north, and when wind speeds \nare greater than 2.5 m s-1. Concentrations downwind of the source are measured using a \ncombination of passive diffusion tube samplers and \u2018ALPHA\u2019 passive samplers, \ndeveloped by CEH (Tang, et al., 2001) as used in the UK Ammonia Monitoring \nNetwork (www.cara.ceh.ac.uk). As part of the network operation, passive diffusion \nsamplers are continuously compared against active denuder samplers at 12 sites to \nensure accurate calibration (Sutton, et al., 2001, Tang, et al., 2007). In order to compare \nthe relative response to wet and dry deposition, equivalent estimates of the total N \ndeposition are required for each of the experimental treatments. For comparison with \nempirical Critical Loads for N (Bobbink, et al., 2003), values are required as an annual \ndeposition rate. The site is well suited to a simplified approach in that there is no visible \npeat, but a complex canopy of mosses, lichens, sedges and ericaceous shrubs, with the \nwater table close (< 10 cm) to the surface except during long drought periods. The site \nis also exposed to very low concentrations of acidic gases; measurements of SO2 made \nat Auchencorth moss, approximately 2 km from the Whim site, indicate annual median \nconcentrations of 0.44 \u03bcg m-3 (average 2002-2006); this would represent an equivalent \nconcentration of NH3 to chemically neutralise the acidity from dissolved SO2 of 0.43 \u03bcg \nNH3 m-3. Measured HNO3 concentrations in 2006, when monitoring started, were 0.46 \n\u03bcg HNO3 m-3 (CEH, unpublished data); complete neutralisation would require 0.12 \u03bcg \nNH3 m-3\n2. Theory\nMeasurements of the dependence of surface resistance on NH3 concentrations were \nmade using a large flux chamber at CEH Edinburgh, with a mixture of ombrotrophic \nbog vegetation including Sphagnum mosses, Eriophorum vaginatum L. and Calluna \nvulgaris (L.) Hull, to simulate the bog surface at Whim (Jones et al., 2007). Individual \ncomplete plants with their underlying peat were sampled from the bog and assembled \ninside the chamber, which was supplied with charcoal filtered air to which known \nconcentrations of NH3 up to 100 \u03bcg m-3 were added. The results were divided into day-\ntime and night-time to separate the responses to stomatal and non-stomatal uptake. \nNon-stomatal deposition was shown to be controlled by a surface resistance which \nvaried linearly with NH3 concentration, following the expression Rns = 1.13 \u03c7 +4.6 s m-1 \nat night, and Rns = 1.05 \u03c7 +3.6 s m-1 during the day, where Rns is the non-stomatal \nresistance; the day and night non-stomatal resistances were not significantly different. \nThe stomatal resistance Rs was invariant with NH3 concentration, at 112 s m-1 (Jones, et \nal., 2007). \nThe dependence of the overall surface resistance (Rc) on air concentration is not linear \nin daytime, because the stomatal and non-stomatal resistances act in parallel, so that 1\/\nRc = 1\/Rns + 1\/Rs.  At night, 1\/Rs is assumed to be zero, so that Rc = Rns. The measured \nsurface resistances in the flux chamber experiment cannot, however, be used directly to \nestimate deposition under field conditions, because the air concentration in the chamber \nexperiment depends on the uptake rate, which in turn depends on the degree of mixing \nwithin the chamber \u2013 the problem can also be expressed in terms of identifying the \nequivalent surface concentration of ammonia in the chamber and in the field. \nThe transfer of NH3 to the surface can be expressed using the normal resistance \nanalogy:\nFlux = \u03c7 * vd , where vd = 1\/ (Ra +Rb +Rc) and both \u03c7 and vd are referenced to a specific \nheight, Ra and Rb refer to aerodynamic and boundary-layer resistance and Rc is the \nsurface resistance. Separating the aerodynamic and surface terms, the flux can also be \nexpressed in terms of a surface concentration \u03c7s :  Flux = \u03c7s \/ Rc.  \nIn the chamber the flux is calculated from the difference between measured outlet (\u03c7out) \nand inlet concentrations (\u03c7in). The overall transfer resistance between the air in the \nchamber and the surface comprises an \u2018aerodynamic + boundary layer\u2019 resistance term \n(Rbox), that is a function of the fixed geometry and air flow through the chamber, and \nthe surface resistance (Rc). The total flux can then be expressed as:\nFlux = \u03c7in \/ (Rbox + Rc) = \u03c7s \/ Rc (1)  \nThe effective surface concentration \u03c7s is the concentration driving the diffusive transfer \nacross the surface resistance (Rc), after turbulent transport through the air and diffusion \nthrough the boundary-layer.\nCase 1 \u2013 night-time (stomata assumed to be closed): 1\/Rs = 0\nThe assumption of closed stomata follows from the chamber experiments (Jones, et al., \n2007) in which the variation of Rc with \u03c7 at night was made over similar vegetation to \nthat growing at Whim. The same definition of day and night was used for the field data \nas in the chamber experiments, i.e. \u2018day\u2019 was when total solar radiation was greater \nthan 50 W m-2, and \u2018night\u2019 when less than 10 W m-2.  \nIn the chamber, the measured variation of NH3 deposition with \u03c7in (\u03bcg m-3) shows that: \nRc = Rns = A * \u03c7in + B, (2)\nwhere A and B are constants. A has units (s \u03bcg-1 m2); B has units (s m-1).\nThe surface concentration \u03c7s from eqn. 1 can therefore be written as:\n\u03c7s = Rc * \u03c7in \/ (Rbox + Rc), (3)\nand substituting for \u03c7in from eqn. 2,\n\u03c7s = Rc * (Rc \u2013 B) \/ [A*(Rbox + Rc)] (4)\nwhich is the effective surface concentration of NH3 in the chamber experiment.\n \nIn the field, for a particular reference height (z) at which \u03c7 and (Ra+Rb) are measured or \ncalculated:\nFlux = \u03c7(z) \/ (Ra(z) +Rb +Rc) = \u03c7s \/ Rc (5)\nIf the relationship between \u03c7s and Rc is the same in the field as in the chamber then we \ncan substitute eqn. 4 into eqn. 5, to get:\n\u03c7(z) \/ (Ra(z) +Rb +Rc) = (Rc \u2013 B) \/ [A*(Rbox + Rc)] (6)\nDropping the formal dependence on z for simplicity, rearranging gives a quadratic in Rc \nin terms of measured (bold) or calculated (italics) parameters:\nRc2 + (Ra+Rb \u2013 \u03c7*A-B)*Rc \u2013 B*(Ra+Rb) + \u03c7*A*Rbox = 0 (7)\nThis can be solved for Rc:\nRc=-0.5*(Ra+Rb\u2013\u03c7*A-B)+0.5*[(Ra+Rb\u2013\u03c7*A-B)2 +4* (B*(Ra+Rb)+\u03c7*A*Rbox)]1\/2 (8)\nAs A, B, Ra, Rb, Rbox and \u03c7 are known, then Rc, and hence the flux can be calculated.\nThe chamber data for night-time gave A = 1.13 m2 s \u03bcg-1, B = 4.59 s m-1 and Rbox = 180 \ns m-1  (Jones, et al., 2007). Rc was calculated for a range of (Ra+Rb) and \u03c7 for the given \nvalues of A and B, and showed that to a good approximation, Rc is linear in both \u03c7 and \n(Ra+Rb) for \u03c7 > 50 \u03bcg m-3. \nDuring conditions without fumigation, when ambient NH3 concentrations were small \n(< 5 \u03bcg m-3) a constant Rc of 20 s m-1 was used, as in the algorithm used for mapping \ndry deposition of NH3 across the UK (Smith, et al., 2000).\nCase 2 \u2013 day-time (stomata open):  \nThere are two parallel deposition pathways: to the leaf surface, and through the stomata \ninto the leaf. The overall surface resistance (Rc) can therefore be expressed as:\n1\/Rc = 1\/Rns + 1\/Rs (9)\nwhere Rns is the non-stomatal resistance to the leaf surface, and Rs is the stomatal \nresistance. Experiments in the chamber showed that Rs was effectively constant over \nthe concentration range used, at 112 s m-1, suggesting that uptake and metabolism of \nabsorbed NH3 within the leaf occurred faster than the gas could be deposited through \nthe stomata. The external resistance Rns showed similar behaviour to the night-time \nresistance, following a similar relationship to that in eqn. 2, \nbut with A = 1.05 m2 s \u03bcg-1, and B = 3.61 s m-1 (Jones, et al., 2007).  \nThe non-linear variation of Rc with \u03c7 in the field, based on the data obtained in the \nchamber and illustrated in Figure 1, makes a simple parameterisation more complex \nthan for the night-time case. Details are given in the Appendix. \nA parameterisation has been used during times of fumigation based on fitting the curves \nin Figure 1 with a rectangular hyperbola:\nRc = Rc0 + a.\u03c7\/(b+\u03c7) (10)\nwhere Rc0, a and b show a weak dependence on (Ra+Rb) as given in the Appendix. \nValues of Rc during daytime fumigation are calculated every 15 minutes from eqn. 10.\n3. Calculations of fluxes at the Whim experimental field site\nNH3 is emitted in the field as pure gas diluted in a flow of air that is released from a \nperforated tube (10 m x 0.2 m) mounted 0.5 m above the ground surface. Air \nconcentrations of NH3 at Whim are measured at several locations, both upwind of the \nNH3 release point and downwind along the experimental field transect, using passive \ndiffusion samplers exposed over one month, mounted at 0.1 and 0.5 m above the \nvegetation surface, which is on average 0.3 m above the ground surface. At some \nlocations measurements are made at other heights. Details of the exposure and \nmeasurement techniques have been reported elsewhere (Leith, et al., 2004). Wind speed \nat the two measurement heights is calculated from measurements made at a height of 2 \nm above the ground surface, reported as an average every 15 minutes, from:\nu (z1+h-d) = u(z2-d)*[ln(z1+h-d)-ln(z0)]\/[ln(z2-d)-ln(z0)] (m s-1) (11)\nwhere: \nz1 (NH3 measuring height above vegetation) = 0.1 or 0.5 m, \nh (vegetation height) = 0.3 m, \nz2 (wind speed measurement height) = 2 m, \nd (zero plane displacement of the ground caused by the vegetation) = 0.2 m, \nz0 (roughness length) = 0.03 m\nThe friction velocity (u*) is calculated every 15 minutes from:\nu(z2 -d) = u*.[ln(z2 -d)-ln(z0)]\/k (m s-1) (12)\nwhere k is von Karman\u2019s constant = 0.4\nValues for the aerodynamic resistance (Ra) are calculated every 15 minutes from:\nRa(z-d) = u(z-d)\/(u*)2 (s m-1) (13)\nfor z = 0.1 and z = 0.5 m\nValues for the boundary layer resistance (Rb) are calculated every 15 minutes (Garland, \n1977, Sutton, et al., 1993a) from:\nRb = 1.45 (Re*0.24.Sc0.8) \/u* (s m-1) (14)\nwhere Re* is the Reynolds number = z0.u* \/ \u03bd, \nand \u03bd is the kinematic viscosity of air = 1.42 x 10-5 m2 s-1 at 10 \u00b0C;\nand Sc is the Schmidt number = \u03bd \/D = 0.68\nwhere D is the diffusion coefficient of NH3 in air =  2.09 x 10-5 m2 s-1\nFor every 15 minute period, the total resistance at z = 0.1 m and z = 0.5 m is calculated \nfrom Rt = Ra + Rb + Rc where Rc is given by eqn. 8 (night) or eqn. 10 (day), using the \nmonthly average measured NH3 concentration at that height. The deposition velocity \nvd(z) = 1\/ Rt(z) calculated for each 15 minute period during fumigation is then \nmultiplied by the average NH3 concentration during fumigation \u03c7(z) at each point along \nthe transect, to give the deposition, and summed over the month. Deposition during \nperiods without fumigation is calculated using the monthly average ambient \nconcentration and the monthly average (Ra + Rb) at each height, with a constant value of \nRc (20 s m-1), and is the same at all points across the site. \nComparison of the deposition calculated from the independent concentration \nmeasurements at 0.1 m and 0.5 m provides an estimate of the overall uncertainty. \nDivergence is mostly caused by large concentration differences with height close to the \nNH3 source, where the influence of the emission height (0.5 m) is evident, and the NH3 \ngas is not well mixed vertically. The good agreement further from the source (Table 1) \nsuggests that the overall uncertainty in the calculation is relatively unimportant in \nestimating the dry deposition flux.\n4. Results from Whim bog site monitoring data (monthly)\nA typical pattern of air NH3 concentration along the transect is shown in Figure 2 (left-\nhand axis) for the annual average at both sampling heights (0.1 m and 0.5 m) in 2006. \nThe concentration measured at 0.1 m above canopy close to the source is less than that \nat 0.5 m because the emitted NH3 is not yet well mixed vertically. The number of \nminutes of NH3 release is known for each month, so the average concentration during \nfumigation can be calculated, and is also shown in Figure 2 (right-hand axis). In 2006 \nNH3 was released over 535 h, or 6% of the time. This pattern of exposure would be \ntypical of a situation downwind of a major point source of NH3 such as an intensive \npoultry unit. Air concentrations at 0.1 m above the vegetation are still elevated at 80 m \ndownwind (one-tailed paired t-test over 11 monthly data, Feb - Dec 2006; p=0.04), but \nare not significantly different from ambient at 105 m (p=0.17). The lateral extent of the \nemission plume can be judged from measurements made at 60 m downwind of the \nsource (Figure 3).\nThis pattern of average air concentration is reflected in the deposition pattern for 2006 \n(Figure 4), using the methods outlined above, corresponding to the data in Figure 2. It \ncan be seen that the deposition estimated from the independent measurements at 0.1 m \nand 0.5 m are the same (as they should be) despite the small differences in NH3 \nconcentrations at the two heights (Figure 2 and Table 1). Figure 5 shows the deposition \nbased on measurements at a height of 0.5 m for each of the 4 years; the pattern is the \nsame from year to year, although the absolute deposition varies, depending on the \nfraction of time that NH3 is released, and the consequent differences in annual average \nconcentrations (Table 1).\nThe average deposition velocities (vd = flux\/concentration) are shown in Figure 6 for \n2006 only, as a function of distance downwind of the source, and in Figure 7 as a \nfunction of air concentration (note the logarithmic concentration scale).\nA summary of the estimated deposition for each full year of treatment to date \n(2003-2006) at each of the sampling points is shown in Table 1. The differences \nbetween annual deposition estimates made from the independent air concentration data \nat 0.1 m and 0.5 m above the canopy were small for distances more than 8 m from the \nsource, after vertical mixing was complete. Over 4 years (2003 to 2006) and at 8 \nsampling points more than 10 m from the NH3 source, the mean difference between the \ntwo NH3 deposition estimates was 2%.\n5. Discussion \nThe approach used here relies on data gathered from the chamber experiment using \nreconstructed vegetation canopies, which could not reproduce completely the spatial \ncomplexity or overall species composition observed in the field. The chamber \nmeasurements were also made at least an hour after watering, avoiding the presence of \nsurface water on the vegetation. These artificial conditions compared to the field \nsituation may have led to systematic differences in deposition which cannot be \nquantified.\nThe uncertainty involved in using eqn. 10 is described in the Appendix. However, this \nbegs the question as to whether the daytime stomatal resistance Rs remains constant as \nconcentration increases, or at different phenological stages. Evidence from studies of \nsimilar semi-natural species (Luzula sylvatica) suggests no saturation of stomatal \nuptake of NH3 when plants were exposed to concentrations up to 400 \u00b5g m-3 (Hill, \n1999). The measurements on which the value of 112 s m-1 were based (Jones, et al., \n2007) were made using well-watered vegetation at temperatures between 1 \u00b0C and 20 \n\u00b0C, typical of the range observed in the field, and showed no discernible variation with \ntemperature. However, it may be that under very dry conditions, or at freezing \ntemperatures, stomatal uptake of NH3 is inhibited, so that the estimates provided above \nmay be too high at some times of the year. \nAs to temporal variations, the dependence of fumigation on wind direction and wind \nspeed means that NH3 is released at Whim bog for periods as short as 1 minute, up to \nseveral hours. The variation in air concentration is the main driving factor determining \nthe temporal variation in deposition, as seen even in the annual data (Figure 5 and \nTable 1). The non-stomatal resistances derived from eqn. 8 are based on the chamber \nresults (Jones, et al., 2007) obtained once equilibrium had been established. During \ninitial fumigation, before saturation occurs, uptake is likely to be greater than estimated \nfrom the equilibrium data; however, when fumigation ceases, there will be release of \nabsorbed NH3 back to the ambient air. Any discrepancy between initial uptake and final \nrelease can be attributed to the \u2018fixing\u2019 of NH3 on the vegetation surface in an involatile \nform. The estimates above assume that there is no net deposition related to this \n\u2018capacitance\u2019 effect during intermittent fumigation, so may underestimate the true \ndeposition. This effect is expected to be small in relation to the overall deposition rate, \nparticularly for the low concentrations of acidic gases at this site, but the uncertainty \ncannot be quantified.\nThe uncertainty arising from use of monthly-averaged NH3 concentrations is also \ndifficult to assess. At night-time, the linear dependence of Rc on concentration means \nthat the monthly mean of the 15-minute Rc values based on monthly mean \nconcentrations would not differ from the monthly mean of the 15-minute Rc values \nbased on the 15-minute average concentration values, had these been available. \nHowever, the 15-minute derived deposition velocity vd = 1\/(Ra+Rb+Rc) does not scale \nlinearly with concentration, so that the monthly dry deposition based on 15-minute vd \nand a monthly mean concentration will not in general be the same as the monthly dry \ndeposition based on 15-minute vd and 15-minute concentrations. An estimate of the \nuncertainty introduced from this averaging process can be gained by comparing the \ndifference in predicted deposition by changing concentration from 0.5 \u03c7 to 1.5 \u03c7 for a \ntypical value of (Ra+Rb) of 40 s m-1; this introduces a range in deposition of \u00b110% at \n600 \u03bcg m-3 and \u00b130% at 100 \u03bcg m-3, but if within a month the concentration fluctuates \nbetween fumigation episodes so that one-third of the time it is at 0.5 \u03c7 , \u03c7 and 1.5 \u03c7, the \noverall effect on the monthly deposition is \u00b13% or less.\nThe more complex relationship between Rc and \u03c7 during daytime fumigation (Figure 1), \nwhich dominates the deposition flux over a month, also introduces uncertainty caused \nby variation in concentration during different fumigation periods within the monthly \ntimescale of the ammonia concentration measurements. However, for concentrations \nabove 100 \u03bcg m-3 the variation in Rc with concentration is < 20%, so the largest relative \nuncertainties in Rt will occur in the region where the concentration during fumigation is \nless than 100 \u03bcg m-3, which is at distances of more than 40 m from the release point \n(Figure 2). Even at 50 \u03bcg m-3 a similar calculation to that for night time (above) yields a \nrange of deposition of \u00b140% between 0.5 \u03c7 and 1.5 \u03c7, but an overall uncertainty in \ndeposition of around \u00b11%.\nAll the data on which these estimates are based were obtained in well-watered \nconditions but with dry leaf surfaces, using a chamber with charcoal-filtered air (Jones, \net al., 2007). It is to be expected that in regions with higher concentrations of acidic \ngases such as SO2 or HNO3 the capacity for NH3 uptake by surfaces would be \nenhanced, i.e. the surface resistances for non-stomatal uptake would be less than used \nin the above calculations. For the Whim bog site the comparison with charcoal-filtered \nair is a reasonable approximation, given the very low air concentrations of acidic gases \npresent, but the values and parameterisations used in this study to calculate effective \nsurface resistances and deposition velocities cannot safely be extrapolated to other sites \nwhere there may be much higher concentrations of acidic gases. Deposition during rain, \nand after rainfall to wet surfaces, would also be expected to be greater than to dry \nsurfaces, but NH3 that dissolved in surface water on the vegetation would (mostly) be \nreleased to the atmosphere as water evaporated. The methods used here would \nsystematically underestimate dry deposition of NH3 in such conditions.\nUse of an inferential method for estimating dry deposition relies on the assumption that \nfluxes are not greatly affected by advection and storage terms which arise from \nmeasurements being made at a fixed height above the vegetation surface at which gas \nexchange occurs. The use of independent concentration measurements at two heights \n(0.1 and 0.5 m) above the canopy suggests (Table 1) that any such errors are small \nrelative to the errors introduced by the method of calculation, at least for distances more \nthan 8 m from the source, with no consistent bias from year to year.\nThe net effect of all these assumptions and uncertainties, the approximations used in \ncalculating Ra and Rb, and the measurement error in NH3 concentrations cannot be \neasily quantified; an estimate of \u00b1 30% for the uncertainty in annual dry deposition can \nbe made based on \u2018expert judgement\u2019 with a potential bias towards underestimating \ndeposition. This needs to be set in the context of the currently used methods for \nestimating NH3 dry deposition, which assume a value of Rc that is independent of \nconcentration (e.g. 20 s m-1; (Smith, et al., 2000)). Figure 8 shows the comparison \nbetween the methods used here and a simple constant value of Rc = 20 s m-1 for the \nWhim site in 2006, which would predict a very large overestimate, up to 8 times too \nlarge. The calculated annual average values for Rc varied between 30 and 330 s m-1 \ndepending on distance from the source (highest values closer to the source and at night-\ntime); this compares with values up to 140 s m -1 measured in the chamber experiments \n(Jones, et al., 2007).\n6. Conclusions\nThe effect of including a concentration-dependent Rc in the calculation of dry \ndeposition of NH3 using the inferential method is to radically reduce the estimated dry \ndeposition of N at the high NH3 concentrations observed close to sources of NH3. \nWhere high concentrations of NH3 exist, either in experimental exposures, or close to \nmajor sources, any estimates of the consequent dry deposition of NH3 need to take \naccount of the likely dependence of non-stomatal uptake rates on concentration. The \nsite at Whim bog is unique in that the parameters needed for using a concentration-\ndependent deposition rate have been measured under controlled conditions. Such data \nare not available for other vegetation types, for conditions where water availability \nmight restrict stomatal uptake, or where the presence of acidic gases might enhance \nsurface uptake of NH3. This means that estimates of the local contribution of large point \nsources of NH3 to total N deposition cannot be made with confidence unless some \ninformation is available on the concentration dependence of the surface resistance for \nNH3 deposition of the exposed vegetation. The evaluation of potential ecological \nresponses close to large NH3 sources may therefore be difficult using the Critical Loads \napproach (UNECE, 2003), which requires an accurate assessment of deposited N. In \nsuch cases, use of the average NH3 concentrations (the Critical Levels approach (Cape, \net al., 2008)) may be more robust as regards effects on vegetation, but does not address \nthe long-term effects on soils and freshwaters. \nIn rural areas, where concentrations of acidic gases are low, the parameterisations of the \ndeposition process used in this study may give a better indication of actual N deposition \nthan the use of a constant non-stomatal resistance, or constant deposition velocity. \nHowever, the requirement to calculate explicitly the surface resistance as a function of \nNH3 concentration applies only where concentrations occasionally exceed 100 \u00b5g m-3. \nFor regional-scale estimates of NH3 deposition, which rely on the spatially-averaged air \nconcentrations applicable at the km scale, a concentration-independent non-stomatal \nresistance is appropriate because the average NH3 concentrations will be small (usually \n< 10 \u00b5g m-3), and non-stomatal resistances will not be greatly affected.\n7.

The overall surface resistance (Rc) can therefore be expressed as:\n1\/Rc = 1\/Rns + 1\/Rs or    Rns = Rc.Rs\/ (Rs \u2013 Rc) (A1)\nwhere Rns is the non-stomatal resistance to the leaf surface, and Rs is the stomatal \nresistance. Rs is taken to be constant, with a value appropriate to this vegetation type of \n112 s m-1 , and the non-stomatal resistance varies with concentration (Jones et al., \n2007):\nRns = \u03b1.\u03c7in + \u03b2  (A2)\nwhere  \u03b1 = 1.05 m2 s \u03bcg-1 \u03b2 = 3.61 s m-1 \nIn the chamber, the concentration at the point where transfer is determined only by the \nsurface resistance, \u03c7s = Rc * \u03c7in \/ (Rbox + Rc), as before, and can be equated to the \nequivalent concentration in the field (eqn. 4):\n\u03c7s = Rc .\u03c7(z) \/ (Ra(z) +Rb +Rc)  (A3)\nCombining eqn. A1 and A2 gives an expression for \u03c7in\n\u03c7in = Rc.Rs -   \u03b2\/\u03b1 (A4)\n\u03b1.(Rs \u2013 Rc)\nThe term \u03b2\/\u03b1 is small (3.4 \u03bcg m-3) relative to the values of \u03c7in, so can be neglected.\nFrom eqn. 1, Flux = \u03c7in \/ (Rbox + Rc), and substituting for \u03c7in from eqn. A4 gives\nFlux =             R  c.Rs                  in the chamber (A5)\n\u03b1.(Rs \u2013 Rc)(Rbox + Rc)\n= \u03c7(z) \/ (Ra(z) +Rb +Rc)     in the field (A6)\nInverting these equations gives a quadratic in Rc \n(\u03b1.\u03c7 + Rs).Rc2 + [(Ra+Rb).Rs - \u03b1.\u03c7.(Rs- Rbox)].Rc - \u03b1.\u03c7.Rs.Rbox = 0 (A7)\nwhich can be solved to give values for Rc for a range of \u03c7 and (Ra+Rb), given the \nmeasured values of \u03b1, Rs and Rbox from the chamber experiment. The relationship \nbetween field Rc and \u03c7 for different values of (Ra+Rb) in the range observed at Whim \nbog (10-150 s m-1) is shown in Figure 1, and can be approximated by eqn. 10. \nWith the measured values of \u03b1, Rs and Rbox from the chamber experiment, the \nparameters of eqn. 10 can be well described by:\nRc0 = 26.7 e-0.0234 (Ra+Rb) (A8)\na = 7.39 ln(Ra+Rb) + 74.1 (A9)\nb = 44.2 e0.0051(Ra+Rb) (A10)\nwhere Rc = Rc0 + a.\u03c7\/(b+\u03c7) (10)\nThis set of parameters provides estimates of Rc in terms of (Ra+ Rb) and \u03c7 that are \nwithin 1% of those calculated from eqn. A7, and can be used directly from the field \nestimates of Ra(z), Rb and measured \u03c7(z) every 15 minutes to calculate Rc and thence \nRt(z) and vd(z).\nFor values of (Ra+Rb) in the range measured in the field, at the small values of \u03c7 \ntypically used for regional modelling NH3 deposition, the second term of eqn. 10 is less \nthan 2.\u03c7 s m-1, i.e. Rc ~ Rc0 .  For \u03c7 = 1 \u03bcg m-3 this means that the surface resistance is \npredicted to be less than 20 s m-1, the value assumed in area-scale modelling of \ndeposition (Smith et al., 2000), only for values of (Ra+ Rb) > 16 s m-1, leading to only a \nweak dependence of Rt (and vd) on the value of Rc as calculated from eqn. 10. \nTable 1.
