Looking to the \u2018cre-\native industries\u2019 as a source of economic \nstrength is nothing new in the UK (one \nneed only recall the \u2018Cool Britannia\u2019 \nbranding of the last decade), and reflects \nbroader policy shifts towards economi-\ncally harnessing creativity (e.g., the \nUnited Nations Creative Economy Re-\nport advocates creativity as a potential \neconomic driver for so called developing \ncountries) [1]. With economic prospects \nlooking increasingly grim both nation-\nally and within higher education in par-\nticular, however, it is no surprise that \ncreative, practice-led research is being \nlooked to more and more as a resource \nfor potentially commercial benefit, and \nthat the potential of delivering such ben-\nefits is an ever more important criterion \nfor such work [2].  \nThe danger of looking for commercial \npay-offs from practice-based research is \nthat it may construe the organisation and \npotential outcomes of such investigations \ntoo narrowly. Given that such research \ncommonly produces a variety of techno-\nlogical prototypes, it is tempting to as-\nsume a linear model of technological \ntransfer whereby basic research can reap \ncommercial reward through application, \ndevelopment and diffusion as the most \ndirect and measurable form of impact for \nsuch collaborations [3]. However, our \nexploration of collaborative modes sug-\ngests that forms and impacts of creative \npartnerships may be wider in scope and \nless straightforward in development than \nassumed [4]. The purpose of this note, \nthen, is to explore the variety of research \noutcomes, or impacts, produced by cre-\native, practice-led projects, and the or-\nganisational forms that such projects \ntake in order to produce those outcomes, \nin the hope of questioning assumptions \nabout the benefits that might properly be \nexpected from this style of research. \n \nCase Studies: Energy, the  \nEnvironment and  \nPractice-Led Research \nIn order to inform our exploration of \ncreative, practice-led projects, we con-\nducted a survey of interdisciplinary pro-\njects involving creative practitioners to \nbetter understand how they were organ-\nised and the types of outcomes and im-\npacts they made. We focused on projects \ndealing with the energy and the envi-\nronment as a methodological device for \nnarrowing our search while providing \naccess to a wide range of practices that \nare both active and topical. In choosing \nsuch practice-led collaborations we \nsought to expose novel mediations be-\ntween technological research, energy \nrelated practices, the environment, pub-\nlics and users.  \nThe case studies we explored exhib-\nited a wide diversity of forms in terms of \ndisciplinary contributors, forms of col-\nlaboration, outputs and outcomes, and \napproaches to engagement. For instance, \nforms of collaboration included various \ngroupings of university departments, \nlarge and small corporate organizations, \nfunding agencies, government depart-\nments, galleries, museums and homes. \nOutcomes ranged from domestic appli-\nances to journal articles, and from par-\nticipatory workshops to Ph.D. theses. \nThe sites of engagement range from con-\ntemporary art to consumer products and \nfrom industrial trade shows to policy \nintervention. Finally, the case studies \nrevealed different ways in which publics \nand users were mobilised during both \nproject development and dissemination. \nMoreover, our case studies often blurred \nthe distinctions between collaborators, \nusers, process and output. Reporting the \nfull range of collaborations and outputs \nembodied by the 100+ examples we \nlooked at is beyond the scope of this \npaper. For the purposes of this discus-\nsion, then, we briefly describe three case \nstudies, the \u2018Wattson\u2019 energy meter, \n\u2018ERAR-AT\u2019 environmental monitor, and \nthe \u2018Static!\u2019 Project, which illustrate \nresearch configurations typical of our \nresults.  \nWattson is a consumer product that al-\nlows people to monitor their domestic \nelectricity consumption. It was designed \nand is marketed by the London based \nproduct design studio DIY KYOTO. \nWattson indicates energy consumption \nvia a numerical display and by emitting \none of three \u2018ambient\u2019 colours to signify \nlight, medium or heavy usage. DIY \nKYOTO present Wattson as a device to \npromote and facilitate more cost-\nefficient electricity usage practices. Ar-\nguably, the novelty of the monitor lies in \nits aesthetics as an artefact that can be \nplaced on display amid the landscape of \nother decorative objects within the home, \nrather than hidden away as a mere meter. \nOf relevance here is that the collabora-\ntion involved relatively few authors and \nstakeholders, the output was restricted to \na commercial product (as opposed to, for \ninstance, descriptions of process) and \nprospective users were conceived as \nenvironmentally concerned consumers \nrather than, for example, collaborators or \ndiscussants. \nThe ERAR-AT (Environmental Risk \nAssessment Rover) is an artwork created \nin 2008 by two artists, working under the \nname EcoArtTech. It is an apparatus that \nuses its own GPS coordinates to gather \nlocal risk and environmental data (for \nexample air quality, local road traffic \naccident reports and current US terrorist \nwarning levels) for video projection onto \nnearby surfaces. EcoArtTech articulate \nthe device as a sustainable technology \nthat draws attention to the persistent \ntechnoscientific failures of modernity \nand the ensuing technological practices \nand discourses of risk. It is one of a \nnumber of artworks by which \nEcoArtTech draw attention to issues \nrelating to the environment. This project \nalso involved a limited number of con-\ntributors, but in contrast to the last its \noutput is an artwork that depends on the \nvariety of sites within which it operates \nfor its meaning. Consequently it encour-\nages discussion and comment among an \nopen-ended public rather than addressing \nthe end-user simply as consumer. \nOur final case study is the STATIC! \nProject, run by the Swedish Interaction \nInstitute between 2004 and 2005. \nSTATIC! set out to investigate and pro-\nmote awareness of energy use through \nthe discipline of interaction design. In \ncontrast to the previous two projects, \ndisciplinary contributors were diverse, \nand there were multiple stakeholders \nincluding academic, government and \ncommercial agencies. In addition, the \nproject used a variety of design-led \nmethods to encourage cooperation be-\ntween designers and prospective users. \nOutputs of STATIC! included domestic \nproduct prototypes, such as an energy \naware power cord that emits light pat-\nterns signifying varying levels of energy \nbeing used, but the project also resour-\nced the production of postgraduate the-\nses, symposiums, workshops and \nseminars, and publications. \nEven these three case studies reflect a \nbewildering range of participants, organ-\nisational arrangements, practices, out-\ncomes and potential impacts. In the \nfollowing section, we introduce the no-\ntion of creative assemblages to help un-\nderstand the possibilities for research \nillustrated by these projects. \n \nCreative Assemblages \nInspired by developments within the \nsociology of science and technology, we \ndraw upon the notion of assemblage to \nhelp us understand the interweaving of \npractices, technologies, institutions, \nauthors, knowledge and issues constitut-\ning the case studies [5]. The notion of \ncreative assemblages is useful in sensi-\ntising us to how practice-led research is \nheterogeneously composed, the manner \nin which such initiatives occupy, or terri-\ntorialize, contexts of interdisciplinary \nknowledge, how they can be continually \nin the process of development, circula-\ntion and dissemination and to the assem-\nbling practices of creative practitioners \nin building outcomes, alliances and pub-\nlics. In short, the notion allows us to \nappreciate and make legible a range of \nproject forms, including not only simple \ncollaborations producing easily articu-\nlated outcomes, but also the more \nsprawling, multidimensional collectives \nthat produce a variety of seemingly less \ncoordinated outcomes. The conjoint term \ncreative assemblage attunes us to how \ncreativity can be acknowledged as an \neffect of such assembling process rather \nthan the residual capacities of an indi-\nvidual innovation author.  With this in \nmind we have tentatively identified three \nmodels of creative assemblages: \n1) Compact and closed assemblages \nare efforts explicitly oriented to a single \noutcome, a specific issue and a particular \nuse such as product development. The \norganisation tends to involve relatively \nfew participants, and crucially, this form \nof assemblage is characterised by protec-\ntion of intellectual property and devel-\nopment process. The Wattson energy \nmonitor is a case in point. \n2) Compact and open assemblages: \nagain, undertakings concentrating on a \nsingle outcome, however compact and \nopen assemblages disclose intellectual \nproperty, technologies and processes and \nas such demonstrate openness. This al-\nlows the potential for a wider variety of \nimpacts than the \u2018product\u2019 alone, includ-\ning public participation, media attention, \nand potential spin-offs of the technolo-\ngies themselves. The ERAR-AT typifies \nthis model. \n3) Loose and open assemblages are en-\ndeavours supported by multiple agen-\ncies, mobilizing interdisciplinary \nknowledge and practices, resourcing \nmultiple outcomes and in doing so occu-\npying diverse contexts, seeking rele-\nvance to and enrolling multiple publics, \nusers and audiences. Such projects work \nto make as many connections as possi-\nble.  STATIC! exemplifies the loose, \nemergent mode of such assemblages. \nOf course, the three modes are not \nmutually exclusive, nor exhaustive (for \ninstance, we suspect loose but closed \nassemblages occur, though we did not \nfind examples of these). Rather, our \ncharacterisation is a heuristic allowing us \nto consider \u2018logics\u2019 of interdisciplinarity \nbeyond accountability and transfer and \nto avoid linear conceptualisations of \ninnovation.  \n \nBeyond Unitary Outcomes \nImplied in the models of assemblage we \nsuggest above is that practice-led pro-\njects can be characterised by two under-\nlying dimensions of \u2018looseness\u2019 and \n\u2018openness\u2019, and moreover that these di-\nmensions are correlated. In other words, \nassemblages that are relatively compact \nin terms of their disciplinary collabor-\nation and goals will tend to produce out-\nputs that are relatively closed and \nconstrained, amenable to intellectual \nproperty protection. These are the sorts \nof projects that the transfer model fits \nwell. Some of the most exciting assem-\nblages we discovered, however, were \nboth loose and open. They involved a \ndynamically shifting cast of contributors \nranging from core project partners to \nnetwork members and ad hoc partici-\npants, and produced outcomes ranging \nfrom prototypes on the one hand to \ncommunity events, press coverage, post-\ngraduate researchers and a research com-\nmunity on the other. Rather than \nproducing a clear transfer of intellectual \nproperty for commercial gain, such pro-\njects arguably create the conditions in \nwhich intellectual property can be devel-\noped by a wide variety of people in a \nbroad range of settings.  \nClearly our report is preliminary, and \nin this brief note we can only highlight \nsome of our findings. We hope to contri-\nbute, nonetheless, to a discussion about \nthe vast range of creative collaborations \nthat occur, the wide variety of beneficial \noutputs these might produce, and how \nthe notion of creative assemblages can \nhelp us understand these benefits in ways \nthat go beyond simplistic notions of \ntransfer. For it is certainly the case that \ncreative, practice-led research can pro-\nduce economic as well as cultural ben-\nefits. But it is equally certain that too \nnarrow a conception of the appropriate \norganisation and outputs of such re-\nsearch will result in its unique benefits \nbeing lost. \nReferences and Notes \nThis research was undertaken as part of the Creator \nProject (www.creatorproject.org\/). \n1.
