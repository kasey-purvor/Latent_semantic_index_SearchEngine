I have gently but consistently opposed this move, on occasions to the\nintense irritation of some of my fellow members, and always at the risk of appearing to be\na Luddite. Explicitly ('Who, if not we as learning technologists, should be in the forefront\nof the soon-to-happen electronic-journal revolution?') and implicitly ('It is estimated that\nwithin two years, paper-based journals will be considered the dinosaurs of the academic\nworld'), I have increasingly come under pressure to accede to an apparently unstoppable,\napparently imminent change in the method and form of scholarly publication. I set out\nhere my reasons for my continued resistance.\nI am not in principle against electronic journals (who could be?), nor in particular against\nthat new breed of online journals which allow readers to comment on published papers,\nand for their comments to be read by everyone in what becomes a continuously updated\njournal. On the contrary, in theory at least, it makes eminent sense for readers' comments\nto be freely available, since this encourages real-time debate. I can also see the obvious\npotential in a multimedia journal format, one which allows video clips and sound files to\nbe incorporated into contributions. And I am all too aware of the time-lag between\nacceptance of a submission for publication in a paper-based academic journal and\npublication itself, a span of time which in the case of some journals can be inordinate. This\ncan not only be frustrating for an author (although in many cases, given the position of the\nacademic goalposts, 'in press' is as good as a reference to volume and page numbers) but\ncan also be a very real obstacle to acceptance - several times I have seen referees' reports\nstating that while a paper is pubiishable, by the time it appears it is likely to be out of date,\nand that the author would therefore be better off putting it up on his or her local Web site;\nadvice, unsurprisingly, rarely followed until all else has failed because the publication\nwould then not count in the next Research Assessment Exercise (RAE).\nYet while I am conscious of the advantages of an electronic, perhaps interactive, format for\n2\nALT-) Volume 5 Number 2\nacademic journals, I am even more conscious of the disadvantages of publishing Avr-J\nthat way - at present.\nFirst, I am far from convinced that message trails left attached to papers published in\nonline journals lead to worthwhile debate. I am a member of a number of mailing lists, and\nI see mostly unstructured garbage on all of them. There are sometimes pearls to be winkled\nout, and the lists can certainly be very useful if one has a query. In my 17 years of\nexperience in regularly accessing (and for a time - as what we used to call Sysop - running)\nbulletin boards, I have learned that inveterate onliners love nothing more than to respond\nto a request for help, while those same people are often much less inclined to help if they\nhave to write an answer on paper. Perhaps the fact that all members of a mailing list will be\nable to see the act of generosity encourages altruism. Nothing wrong with that, of course -\nthe end justifies the intention, and if email leads to a helping hand, all the better- but the\nloss of control associated with unfiltered comments would, in my view, devalue our journal\nif it were to be allowed to go seriously down the online route, no matter how strict the\nreview process for the papers themselves. And I would be against filtering readers'\ncomments because it involves too much work, and in any event goes against the spirit of\npublic online communication.\nMy second objection is based on my view (one no doubt shared by most ALT members),\nthat it is important for our Association to have a journal of high academic standing. I do\nnot believe (a view, I know, not shared by all ALT members) that, in the near future,\nelectronic journals will be able to achieve such standing in spite of all the conferences and\nworkshops on electronic journals currently being announced. This is an especially thorny\nproblem for those of us who are interested in research into educational technology, since\nthe authors of papers about educational technology are not, for the most part, professional\neducational technologists. Rather, they have applied such technology to their own\nacademic disciplines, and indeed may encounter substantial difficulty in convincing their\npeers within those disciplines that a publication in the area of educational technology\nshould count as being of value in RAEs (whatever forward-thinking academics may wish,\nand whatever Dearing may have to say on the matter). If we are to achieve high standing\nfor our inter-disciplinary high-tech area of research, I believe that we are more likely to do\nso - paradoxically - by producing a traditional paper-based refereed journal than by\ntaking a high-tech approach to scholarly publication.\nWith respect to the time-lag between acceptance and publication, in the case of ALT-J this\nis rarely more than four months (what takes time, as every journal editor knows, is the\nrefereeing process), and I do not think that we should change our policy for the sake of\nthose comparatively uncommon papers which are so time-sensitive that a few weeks make\nall the difference. True, we do lose something, especially in our field, by limiting ourselves\nto text and still images while the Internet can offer us sound and vision (if sluggishly), but\nhere again I would apply the same argument about traditional standing in the academic\ncommunity as a whole.\nMany refereed journals, in all fields - including technological fields - now have their own\nWeb site. Very few of those generally considered to be of high quality and importance\nallow the publication of comments by those who access the site. At best, one can email the\nEditor who might decide to post a message which appears to be vital. Furthermore, those\n3\nEditorial\nsame journals publish only abstracts, editorials and, in some cases, news items - not the full\ntext of papers. Their Editorial Boards have doubtless decided on this policy for much the\nsame reasons as I have outlined above. In other words, I doubt whether the main reason is\none of losing potential sales, since it would not be inconceivable to allow online access only\nto paid-up subscribers.\nI can already hear my opponents. Why let the tail wag the dog? Why let traditionalists\ndecree the format of our flagship publication? I am not ashamed to adopt a pragmatic\nstandpoint here. One should of course distinguish between online versions of journals and\ngenuinely interactive online journals, and it is to the latter that my objections are\nprincipally aimed. But even with the former, I would apply the same argument, the one\nwhich accedes to current attitudes to research publications within academia, as typified by\nthe very word 'paper' for a published article. When those attitudes change (and, yes, they\nmay change soon), so should we, but not before the change has become very clear.\nI realize that this editorial will ruffle the feathers of some readers of this journal. Let them\nvent their anger by submitting a response here - or online in Air-Electronica if possible\npublication on paper seems to them too old-hat.\nGabriel Jacobs\n4\n"}
