INTRODUCTION\nConjugated polymers have attracted considerable interest\nin fundamental and applied research since the discovery of\nsubstantial conductivity in doped polymers.1,2 In particular, a\ngreat deal of effort has been devoted to understanding the\nelectronic and dynamical properties of conjugated polymers.\nPolyaniline \u0001PANi\u0002 and poly\u0001p-pyridyl vinyene\u0002\u0001PPyV\u0002 are\nconducting polymers which differ from their undoped coun-\nterparts such as poly\u0001p-phenylene vinyene\u0002 \u0001PPV\u0002 in that\nthey have a nitrogen heteroatom. They are straightforward to\nsynthesize and in addition they have excellent environmental\nand thermal stability.3 Further, the materials are easy to pro-\ncess and there are quite a large number of possible substitu-\ntions which give the opportunity to tune the electrical and\noptical properties. The wide range of controllable optoelec-\ntronic properties, coupled with excellent stability, make them\nattractive as electronic materials for potential use in a variety\nof applications such as biosensors,4 batteries,5 and field ef-\nfect transistors.6\u20138\nExperimental and theoretical investigations of the dy-\nnamical properties of conjugated polymers play a key role in\nunderstanding the structural and microscopic optoelectronic\nproperties of the materials in various phases in both the pris-\ntine and doped states.9,10 However, it is often the case that\ninformation obtained by different methods has been quite\ninconsistent.11 Though there have been a number of studies\nof the electronic and dynamic properties of PANi and PPyV,\nno consensus has been reached on the assignment of the\nvibrational modes. For example, experimental infrared \u0001ir\u0002\nmode frequencies have been published for PANi,12\u201314 but one\npaper did not assign most of the observed modes,13 and an-\nother assigned only the fundamental ones.14 Using a har-\nmonic potential with parameters transferred from other mol-\necules, Kosti\u0107 et al.15 calculated the vibrational modes,\nwhich are in quite good agreement with previously published\ndata. However, despite these results, no comprehensive study\nis available concerning the dynamical properties of the ma-\nterials, especially the dynamical anisotropy. Realistic first-\nprinciples calculations are a way forward but they are com-\nputationally very demanding and it is often the case that the\ncalculations of the dynamical properties are of the average\naxial values for simple polymers only,16,17 while ignoring the\nanisotropy information. Nevertheless, some progress has\nbeen made in understanding the anisotropy of the polariz-\nability for molecules and molecular crystals18\u201321 and for the\ndielectric and vibrational properties of some of the simpler\namino acid molecules.22 Very recently, an ab initio dynamics\nstudy has been carried out for the undoped polymer PPV.23\nIn this work we present a first-principles investigation of\nthe dynamical properties of the conducting polymers PANi\nand PPyV. We first study the vibrational properties of the\nconducting materials; then we concentrate on the electric\nfield response and Born effective and Mulliken charges. The\nremainder of this paper is organized as follows. Sections II\nand III present the theory and computational details, and then\nin Sec. IV we present and discuss the calculated results for\nthe materials. A short summary concludes the paper in Sec.\nV.\nII. THEORY\nOnly a brief outline is given here, but more details of the\ntheory of the lattice dynamics and perturbations of systems\nwith electric fields can be found elsewhere.24\u201326 When an\nelectric field \u0001 is applied to a polymer system, the change of\nthe dipole moment d may be expressed as\ndi \u2212 d0i = \u0002ij\u0001 j + \u0003ijk\u0001 j\u0001k + \u00af , \u00011\u0002\nwhere i, j, and k run over the x, y, and z axes of the system,\nd0 is the dipole moment at zero field, and \u0001 j ,\u0001k are the jth\nPHYSICAL REVIEW B 74, 165210 \u00012006\u0002\n1098-0121\/2006\/74\u000116\u0002\/165210\u00018\u0002 \u00a92006 The American Physical Society165210-1\nand kth components of the field \u0001, respectively. \u0002ij is the\npolarizability tensor and \u0003ijk the first-order hyperpolarizabil-\nity. The polarizability tensor components \u0002ij can be obtained\nby finding the second-order derivatives of the total energy E\nof the system:\n\u0002ij =\n\u00012E\n\u0001\u0001i\u0001\u0001 j\n. \u00012\u0002\nIn this work we calculate the polarizability components by\nthe use of linear response, within density functional pertur-\nbation theory \u0001DFPT\u0002.24,25 DFPT is not only one of the most\nrobust methods for the calculation of dynamic properties, but\nit is also a method that naturally enables the calculation of\nthe second-order derivatives of the total energy, and thus\ndynamical quantities, such as the polarizability, to be evalu-\nated directly. It is also possible to calculate a number of other\nproperties by considering different perturbations. For ex-\nample, a perturbation of the ionic positions can be used to\nobtain the dynamical matrix and information on the vibra-\ntional properties.\nThe polarizability can also be obtained using the finite-\ndifference \u0001FD\u0002 method, where appropriate. In the FD\nmethod, the dipole moment as a function of electric field is\nobtained and then the polarizability tensor components are\nderived as the proportionality coefficients. However, since\nthe computational cost of the FD method is very consider-\nable and it is not possible to use the method for mixed per-\nturbations, we employ only DFPT for the study of the vibra-\ntional frequencies and effective charges.\nThe basic theory of lattice dynamics is well understood\nand has been described in detail by, for example, Born and\nHuang.26 The properties of phonon modes may be described\ndirectly from the second-order derivative of the total energy\nwith respect to atomic position. According to the harmonic\napproximation, for small atomic displacements from equilib-\nrium, the total energy Etot of the system may be written as24\nEtot = Etot\n0 + \u0003\n\u0004,\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0004\u0001,\u0005\n1\n2\u0004 \u00012Etot\u0001\u0006\u0004\u0002\u0001\u0006\u0004\u0001\u0005\u0005\u0007\u0006\u0004\u0002\u0007\u0006\u0004\u0001\u0005 \u00013\u0002\nwhere \u0007\u0006\u0004\u0002 is the displacement in direction \u0002 for the ion \u0004.\nThe frequencies of the phonon modes \b are the eigenvalues\nof the eigenvalue equation,\n\u0003\n\u0004\u0001,\u0005\n1\n\u0001M\u0004M\u0004\u0001\u0002\n1\/2\n\u00012Etot\n\u0001\u0006\u0004\u0002\u0001\u0006\u0004\u0001\u0005\ne\u0001\u0004\u0001\u0005\u0002 = M\u0004\b2e\u0001\u0004\u0002\u0002 \u00014\u0002\nwhere M\u0004 is the mass of ion \u0004, and e\u0001\u0004\u0002\u0002 and e\u0001\u0004\u0001\u0005\u0002 are the\neigenvectors.\nThe perturbation resulting from an applied electric field\nallows us to evaluate the dielectric response. In the limit of\nlow frequencies of the applied field, the electronic dielectric\npermittivity tensor \u0005ij may be expressed as\n\u0005ij\n\t\n= \nij +\n4\u000b\n\f0\n\u0002ij \u00015\u0002\nwhere \f0 is the volume of the supercell and \u0002ij is the polar-\nizability tensor as defined in Eq. \u00012\u0002.\nThe change in the dipole moment as a result of atomic\ndisplacements may also cause changes in the polarization of\nthe polymer system. Then the so-called Born effective charge\ntensor Zi,jk\n* can be defined as24\nZi,jk\n*\n= \f0\n\nPmac,j\n\n\u0006ik\n=\n\nFik\n\n\u0001 j\n\u00016\u0002\nwhere \u0006ik is the k component of the position of ion i. Thus\nthe Born effective charge tensor of the ith ion Zi,jk\n* is the\npartial derivative of the macroscopic polarization with re-\nspect to a periodic displacement of that ion at the limit of\nzero applied electric field, and in DFPT the tensor is equiva-\nlent to that in the linear relation between the force upon an\natom and the applied electric field.24\nIt is known that the long-range behavior of the Coulomb\ninteraction gives rise to macroscopic electric fields for lon-\ngitudinal \u0001LO\u0002 and transverse \u0001TO\u0002 optical phonons, and the\ncoupling between the phonon modes and the electric field\ngives rise to LO-TO splitting at the \r point.27,28 The Born\neffective charge is a very important quantity and can be used\nto determine the well-known phenomenon of LO-TO split-\nting in polar semiconductors and insulators.\nWith knowledge of the normal modes and the Born effec-\ntive charges of a system, its ir absorption spectrum can be\ncalculated as\nIm \u000e\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0006\u0003\n\u0004,\u0005\nZ\u0004,\u0002\u0005\n* em\u0001\u0004\u0005\u0002\u00062 \u00017\u0002\nwhere m is the mode of vibration, Z\u0004,\u0002\u0005\n* is the effective\ncharge, and em is the phonon eigenvector.\nIII. COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS\nWe have carried out our calculations with the plane-wave\npseudopotential implementation of density functional theory\nusing the CASTEP code.27,28 Plane-wave basis sets are advan-\ntageous compared to conventionally used localized basis sets\nsince they are, in principle, complete and are evenly distrib-\nuted in space and therefore not biased toward any individual\nchemical bonds. In particular, there exists only one param-\neter, the cutoff energy, to determine the completeness of the\nbasis.\nIn our calculations, the many-body exchange and correla-\ntion interactions were described using the generalized gradi-\nent approximation proposed by Perdew and Wang,29 which\ncan provide a good description for hydrogen-bonded sys-\ntems. The use of a plane-wave basis set requires periodic\nboundary conditions in all three dimensions. To achieve this,\na periodic \u201csupercell\u201d method was used and the chain was\nartificially repeated in the two dimensions normal to the\npolymer axis with a sufficiently large unit cell to make\nneighboring interactions negligible. The unit cell was 10\n\u000f10\u000fd \u00c53, where d is the repeat distance along the poly-\nmer chain. Norm-conserving Kleinman-Bylander30 pseudo-\npotentials were used to describe the electron-ion interactions.\nThe cutoff energy was 1000 eV, which converges the total\nenergy of the system to 1.0 meV\/atom. The Monkhorst-Pack\nk-point sampling31 mesh of 1\u000f1\u000f8, was employed to per-\nZHENG et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW B 74, 165210 \u00012006\u0002\n165210-2\nform the integrations in k space over the first Brillouin zone,\nwith the grids for each cell chosen to be dense enough to also\nconverge the total energy to 1.0 meV\/atom.\nWe first optimized the polymer geometrical structures of\nthe ground state using the Hellmann-Feynman force.34 The\nresulting predicted structures of PANi and PPyV at equilib-\nrium are shown in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively. The geometri-\ncal parameters are given in the captions of the figures, and\nare in good agreement with those determined by\nexperiment.32,33\nIV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nA. Vibrational frequencies\nWe have calculated the vibrational frequencies of the two\npolymers at the \r point by using the linear response DFPT\nmethod. The calculated normal mode frequencies of the two\npolymers are shown in Table I. The vibrational properties of\nPANi have been previously studied35,36 in their base form\nand, for comparison, we also list those results in Table I. It\nshould be pointed out that DFPT is based on the harmonic\napproximation and may not be valid at high temperature. As\nstated in Sec. I, the dynamical properties determined by dif-\nferent methods are often inconsistent and so it is difficult to\nmake a direct comparison between the theoretical and experi-\nmental values. Therefore, theoretical results are predictive\nrather than comparative.\nTable I shows that the frequencies of normal modes occur\nmainly in three bands. The bands in the region\n225.1\u2013419.3 cm\u22121 for PANi and 154.7\u2013552.3 cm\u22121 for\nPPyV are due to out-of-ring-plane oscillations. The bands for\nPANi ranging from 604.3 to 1608.8 cm\u22121, and from\n628.4 to 1616.1 cm\u22121 for PPyV come from the \u201ccollective\nbehavior\u201d of the polymers, such as mixed CuC and CuN\nstretching, NuH and CuH bending, wagging, and rock-\ning, etc. The bands in the region above 3000 cm\u22121 corre-\nspond to CuH and NuH stretching modes. Detailed as-\nsignments of the frequencies for both polymers are made in\nthis work.\nThe vibrational properties may be used to investigate the\nnitrogen doping effect present in the materials. Examination\nof Table I indicates that the CuN \u0001vinyl CvC\u0002 stretching\nmodes at 1608.8 \u00011616.1\u0002 cm\u22121 for PANi \u0001PPyV\u0002 are in the\nsame range regardless of the different nitrogen doping posi-\ntion in the two polymers. Actually, these mode frequencies\nare quite stable compared with the corresponding vinyl mode\n1613.7 cm\u22121 of PPV.23 The fact that the vinyl oscillating\nmodes occur in the same frequency range for these systems\nsuggests that the nitrogen atom does not have much influence\non them.\nGiven the normal modes, the infrared absorption spectra\ncan be calculated from Eq. \u00017\u0002. For complex systems like\nconjugated conducting polymers, the ir spectra can be useful\nin interpreting the vibrational properties. The calculated ir\nspectrum for PANi is plotted in Fig. 3 and for PPyV in Fig.\n4. Notable differences can be found in the predicted ir spec-\ntra for PANi, PPyV, and undoped PPV.23 It is known that\nPANi and PPyV are conducting polymers; this implies that\nthe nitrogen doping atom plays a key role in the transport\nmechanisms of the materials.\nB. Electric field response\nThe linear response of the electronic charge density gives\nthe first-order variation in the electronic density induced by\nthe external field. Figures 5 and 6 show for PANi and PPyV\nthe first-order electronic charge densities in response to an\napplied electric field obtained by using DFPT. The contribu-\ntions to the charge density from different atoms can be\nclearly seen, and it is apparent that the polarizability is de-\nFIG. 1.

For comparison, we have also\ncalculated the polarizability for the \u201cmolecules\u201d that are pro-\nduced by saturating the two dangling bonds with hydrogen\natoms in the PANi and PPyV repeat units shown in Figs. 1\nand 2. The dipole moments as a function of applied field\ncalculated by the finite- difference method are shown in Fig.\n7 for the PANi \u201cmolecule.\u201d The associated polarizability ten-\nsor components are listed in Table II along with those for\nPPyV. It has been previously demonstrated21 that the finite-\ndifference DFT approach is capable of yielding values in\ngood agreement with experiment for molecules.\nThe experimental determination of the full polarizability\ntensor is normally rather difficult. To the best of our knowl-\nedge, there are no reports of the anisotropy of the polariz-\nability in the literature which we can use for comparison.\nHowever, it is perhaps useful to compare the DFPT results\nwith the corresponding FD results. In Table II, it is found that\nthe major contribution to the average polymer polarizability\n\u0002av\nDFPT \u0007=Tr\u0001\u0002DFPT\u0002 \/3\b is the component \u0002zz. For PPyV, the\nthree individual principal components are very similar to\nthose of an isolated PPV chain,23 which may be attributed to\nthe similarity of the structures of PPyV and PPV. Both PPyV\nand PPV have the property that \u0002zz\u0012\u0002yy and \u0002yy\t\u0002xx. The\nanisotropy is much greater than for \u0002FD in the case of the\ndangling-bond-saturated molecules. For the molecules, the\ncomponent \u0002zz is less than for the polymers while \u0002xx and\n\u0002yy are larger. Also, \u0002zz for PANi is substantially smaller than\nfor PPyV. It is found that the values of \u0002av\nDFPT for the two\npolymers are in reasonable agreement with typical data for\nthe axial polarizability of conjugated polymers.16,17\nThe calculated permittivity values of PPyV also show\nstrong anisotropy, with \u0005zz\u0012\u0005yy and \u0005xx\t\u0005yy. The average\nPPyV permittivity \u0005av is 2.10 \u0001compared to 2.15 for PPV\u0002.\nThis feature is similar to that of PPV for an isolated polymer\nchain. The predicted value of PPyV \u0005av is reasonable when\ncompared with the typical permittivity values of polymers.37\nComparing the values of the permittivity tensors of the ma-\nterials, it was found that the local field has a greater influence\non the permittivity asymmetry of PPyV than that of PANi.\nFor PANi, the principal components of the permittivity ten-\nsor show less anisotropy than for PPyV with \u0005xx\t\u0005yy\t\u0005zz,\nsuggesting that the different doping position of the nitrogen\natom is significant in this regard.\nC.

It is found that\nfor the hydrogen atoms, all the Mulliken population atomic\ncharges possess roughly the same value in both PANi and\nPPyV. This suggests that the electronic structure of each hy-\ndrogen atom is similar in the two polymers. For carbon at-\noms, except for C1 and C4 in PANi and C1, C4, and C5 in\nPPyV, the Mulliken charges are also similar. In PANi, there\nis some positive charge accumulation \u00010.13\u0002 at the node at-\noms C1 and C4; for PPyV, the nominal charges for C1 and C4\nare 0.14 and 0.16, respectively. However, perhaps due to the\nnitrogen doping atom in the ring, C5 has much less negative\ncharge \u0001\u22120.06\u0002 than its counterpart C5 in PANi. There are\nmarked differences between the Mulliken charges of the ni-\ntrogen atom \u0001\u22120.60 versus \u22120.43\u0002 in PANi and PPyV, due to\nthe fact that there is a double bond for the nitrogen atom in\nPPyV, and a single one in PANi.\nIt is instructive to make a direct comparison between the\nMulliken charges and the average Born effective charges and\nto try to understand the reason for the discrepancies. For\nhydrogen atoms, there are marked differences between the\naverage Born effective charges and the Mulliken charges.\nThe effective charges are, with the exception of H7, less than\none-tenth of the Mulliken charges in PANi. For the carbon\natoms, there are clear differences between the two kinds of\ncharge. In PANi, the largest discrepancy is more than 0.6, but\nZav\n* and Zat do have the same sign. In contrast, there are\ndifferent charge signs for atoms C3, C4, C5, and C8 in PPyV.\nThe nitrogen doping effect in the ring may be responsible for\nthis. The Born effective charge is directly related to the dy-\nnamic properties of a system, and especially to the electronic\nstructure changes. Therefore the chemical environmental ef-\nfects, such as neighboring chemical bonds, can play a sig-\nnificant role in affecting the charges. The nitrogen atom has a\nsmaller negative effective charge \u0001\u22120.685\u0002 in PPyV than that\nFIG. 6. \u0001Color online\u0002 The electronic charge densities for PPyV.\n\u0001a\u0002, \u0001b\u0002, and \u0001c\u0002 correspond to perturbations in the x, y, and z direc-\ntions.

The\ndiscrepancies between the Born effective charges and Mul-\nliken population atomic charges highlight their different ori-\ngins. The Mulliken population charges are based on the par-\ntition of the Kohn-Sham orbitals and provide information on\nthe static electronic structure, whereas the Born effective\ncharges are based upon the dynamics of the system, and\ngenerate information concerning dynamical properties.\nTherefore when a dynamical system is under consideration,\neffective charges are normally more relevant.\nV. CONCLUSION\nAb initio investigations of the dynamical properties of the\ntwo polymers PANi and PPyV have been reported. The vi-\nbrational frequencies of the polymers are calculated by di-\nrectly evaluating the dynamical matrix of force constants us-\ning a linear response determination of the second-order\nchange in the total energy induced by atomic displacements.\nVibrational frequencies are calculated and assignments are\nmade for the phonon modes of the two polymers. Most of the\nphonon modes have been classified: in particular the higher-\nfrequency phonon modes are due to CuH and CvN\nstretch. We also present the results of calculations of the\npolarizability and permittivity of the materials, which are in\nreasonable agreement with the typical experimental values\nfor conjugated polymers. The calculated polarizability and\npermittivity tensors for the polymers in this work are in rea-\nsonable agreement with typical values of axial polarizability\nand permittivity of conjugated polymers where comparison\nis possible. Analyses of the first-order electronic charge den-\nsities give insight into the behavior of the electronic polariz-\nability. We present the dynamical Born effective charges and\nthe nominal Mulliken population atomic charges. It is noted\nthat effective charges are more appropriate for use in the\nstudy of the dynamics for the system. Notable differences are\nfound in the predicted dynamic properties obtained for PANi,\nPPyV, and PPV, which may play a significant role in the\ntransport properties of this class of conducting polymers.\nComments are made on their relation to the underlying poly-\nmer structure and the charge modifications induced by dop-\ning.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe are grateful for an allocation of computing time on the\nHPCx computer at Daresbury Laboratories through the\nUKCP consortium.
