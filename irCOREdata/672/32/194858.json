Introduction\nMuch of the recent progress in the understanding of gamma-ray\nbursts (GRBs) has come from bursts detected with good spatial\naccuracy with BeppoSAX and it is particularly at X-ray wave-\nlengths that GRB afterglows are detected (Piro 2001), about\nhalf producing no detectable optical afterglow emission (Fynbo\net al. 2001). It is also only at X-ray wavelengths that emission\nlines are detected in afterglows, allowing firm estimates to be\nmade of the cosmological redshifts and the outflow velocities\nof the afterglow material (Piro et al. 2000; Reeves et al. 2002).\nXMM-Newton (Jansen et al. 2001), with its large e\u000bective area,\nis particularly suited to this work. Previous detections of emis-\nsion lines in GRB afterglows with BeppoSAX and Chandra\nhave concentrated on emission from highly-ionised iron (Piro\net al. 1998, 2000; Antonelli et al. 2000; Yoshida et al. 2001);\nhowever recent observations with XMM-Newton have revealed\nseveral emission lines at lower energies (Reeves et al. 2002).\nMost plausible mechanisms for the production of a GRB\ninvolve a newly-formed black hole surrounded by a short-lived\naccretion disk regardless of the progenitor (Paczynski 1998;\nMacFadyen & Woosley 1999; Ru\u000bert & Janka 1999; Me\u00b4sza\u00b4ros\n2001). Recent evidence suggests that the progenitors of long-\nduration GRBs are massive stars (Paczynski 1998; Bloom et al.\n1999; MacFadyen & Woosley 1999; Reeves et al. 2002).\nVarious models have been proposed to account for the\nemission spectra (in particular the claim of a high equivalent\nwidth Fe emission line (Antonelli et al. 2000)) and lightcurves\nof the afterglow. For instance, the nearby reprocessor model\n(Rees & Me\u00b4sza\u00b4ros 2000; Ballantyne & Ramirez-Ruiz 2001;\nSend offprint requests to: D. Watson, e-mail: wat@star.le.ac.uk\nKallman et al. 2001) involving reflection of synchrotron emis-\nsion from the walls of a cone tunnelled out of a massive star,\nyielding large equivalent width Fe emission lines; or a \u201csupra-\nnova\u201d model (Vietri & Stella 1998) which invokes a time delay\n(>\u001830 days) between an initial supernova (SN) explosion and\nthe GRB, giving a spectrum briefly dominated either by the re-\ncombination of Fe in a photoionised plasma (Vietri & Stella\n1998) or reflection of synchrotron emission o\u000b the walls of a\nwide funnel excavated in the SN remnant (Vietri et al. 2001).\nRecently, Reeves et al. (2002) have suggested that the early\nX-ray afterglow spectrum of GRB 011211 is dominated by\nthermal emission from a metal-enriched, but notably Fe-poor\ncollisionally-ionised plasma ejected in a recent SN explosion\nand heated by the GRB.\nIn Sect. 2 we report on observations of two GRB after-\nglows with XMM-Newton, presenting the spectra in Sect. 3. In\nSect. 4 these results are discussed and their implications for\nother X-ray observations of afterglows examined. Our conclu-\nsions are in Sect. 5. Unless otherwise stated, all errors quoted\nare 90% confidence limits for one parameter of interest. A cos-\nmology where H0 = 75 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 and q0 = 0:5 is assumed\nthroughout.\n2. Observations and data reduction\n2.1. GRB 001025A\nSmith et al. (2000) and Hurley et al. (2000) report detection\nof a GRB by the RXTE all-sky monitor, NEAR and Ulysses\nbeginning at 03:10:05 UT on 25 October 2000.

Watson et al.: X-ray afterglows of GRBs observed with XMM-Newton\nflux of 2:0 \u0002 10\u22126 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 in the 25\u2013100 keV band as de-\ntected by Ulysses. No variable source optical counterpart was\ndetected down to an R-band magnitude limit of \u001824.5 (Fynbo\net al. 2000).\nXMM-Newton began observing the error-box\nof GRB 001025A 45 hours after the burst for two EPIC-pn\nexposures of 8 ks and 16 ks and single 37 ks exposures of the\nMOS cameras in full frame mode. The thin filters were used in\neach case.\nThe data were processed and reduced with the SAS, ver-\nsion 5.2, datasets from both EPIC-MOS cameras were co-\nadded and both EPIC-pn exposures were also co-added and\nthe resulting two datasets fit simultaneously. Source extrac-\ntion regions were 3500 in radius and an o\u000b-source background\nextraction region of 7000 radius was chosen. Both single and\ndouble pattern (as well as triple and quadruple pattern for the\nMOS), good (FLAG = 0) events were used with the ready-\nmade response matrices1 provided by the XMM-Newton SOC.\nThe spectra were binned with a minimum of 20 counts per bin.\nThe final X-ray source positions were determined after cross-\ncorrelation with the USNO A2.0 optical catalogue based on the\nSAS task eposcorr (see Tedds & Watson 2002).\nTwo sources were detected in the IPN error-box (Altieri\net al. 2000a,b); the brighter, with coordinates (J2000)\nRA 08h36m35.86s, Dec \u221213\u000e04012.2800, and a 68% error ra-\ndius of 0.600, was seen to decay slowly (at 99.8% confidence),\na power-law decay (F \/ t\u2212\f) with index \f = 3:0 \u0006 1:9 fitting\nthe lightcurve well. We identify this source as the afterglow\nof GRB 001025A. The Galactic hydrogen absorbing column in\nthis direction is 6:1 \u0002 1020 cm\u22122 (using the FTOOL nh, Dickey\n& Lockman 1990). Its mean 0.2\u201310.0 keV flux was 4:4 \u0002\n10\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121, corresponding to an afterglow luminosity\nof 2:8 \u0002 1043 erg s\u22121 using the redshift (z = 0:53) determined\nfrom the thermal plasma model fit to the data (see Sect. 3.1).\nThe second source is fainter (1:2 \u0002 10\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121) and\nshows no evidence for variability.\n2.2. GRB 010220\nGRB 010220 was detected by BeppoSAX at 22:51:07 UT on\n20 February 2001 and subsequently localised to within a 40 ra-\ndius circle; the burst duration was \u001840 s, with \u0018660 count s\u22121\npeak flux in the 40\u2013700 keV band (Manzo et al. 2001). No op-\ntical counterpart was detected to a limiting magnitude of R \u2019\n23:5 (Berger et al. 2001), however the burst position is in the\nGalactic plane (bII = 1:41), where the Galactic nebula IC 1805\nlies along the line of sight (Castro-Tirado et al. 2001). The\nGalactic hydrogen absorbing column is 8:6\u0002 1021 cm\u22122 (using\nthe FTOOL nh, Dickey & Lockman 1990). At 14.8 hours af-\nter the burst, XMM-Newton began observing at the coordinates\nof the BeppoSAX error-circle. The observation of GRB 010220\nwas contaminated by a high and variable background. To\nmitigate this e\u000bect, only data where the background rate was\nrelatively low were used. The EPIC-pn exposure was 43 ks;\nscreening for flares left 20 ks of good data. Full frame mode\n1 http:\/\/xmm.vilspa.esa.es\/ccf\/epic\nand the medium filter were used for the observation. No data\nwere available from the EPIC-MOS cameras.\nThe data were processed and reduced with the SAS ver-\nsion 5.2. A source extraction region of 2000 radius and an\no\u000b-source background extraction region of 8000 radius were\nchosen. Both single and double pattern, good (FLAG = 0)\nevents were used with the ready-made response matrix1 pro-\nvided by the XMM-Newton SOC. The spectra were binned with\na minimum of twenty counts per bin. Source positions were de-\ntermined as noted above.\nFour sources were detected in the BeppoSAX error circle;\nthe brightest source is 1800 from the centre, with the others\nat >30. No variability is detected in any of the sources at greater\nthan 2\u001b confidence. We assume that the brightest source, at\ncoordinates (J2000): RA 02h37m01.66s, Dec +61\u000e45056.0100\nwith a 68% confidence error circle of 1.200 radius is the GRB af-\nterglow. This source decays at 94% confidence, with a best-fit\ndecay index, \f = 1:2 \u0006 1:0. Its mean 0.2\u201310.0 keV flux was\n3:3 \u0002 10\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 (corresponding to an afterglow lumi-\nnosity of 7:3\u0002 1043 erg s\u22121 in the rest frame 0.2\u201310.0 keV band\nbased on the best-fit redshift (z = 1:0) from the thermal plasma\nfit to the data).\n3. Spectral fitting\nIn order to test the wider applicability of the collisionally-\nionised plasma model proposed by Reeves et al. (2002) to\nexplain the XMM-Newton observations of the afterglow of\nGRB 011211, our new GRB X-ray afterglow data were fit with\nthe same set of models. They were a) a power-law, b) a power-\nlaw with a variable, cold, redshifted absorber, c) a variable\nabundance collisionally-ionised plasma model (the MEKAL\nmodel, Mewe et al. 1985; Liedahl et al. 1995) with the abun-\ndances of Mg, Si, S, Ar and Ca fit jointly, Ni allowed to vary\nfreely and all other elements fixed at the solar value and d) an\nionised reflection model (Ballantyne & Ramirez-Ruiz 2001)\nwhere the emission arises purely from the X-ray flux scat-\ntered o\u000b material with twice the solar elemental abundance,\nalso modified by a cold, redshifted absorber. In all cases an ab-\nsorber fixed at the Galactic value was included.\nIn order to test the significance of the fit improvements,\n10 000 spectra were simulated using the parameters derived\nfrom fitting an absorbed power-law (model b) to the data in\neach case. Models b) and c) were fit to the simulated data and\nthe di\u000berence in \u001f2 computed. The results of these tests are re-\nported in Table 1. Using a random gaussian distribution of ini-\ntial parameters centred on the parameters derived from fitting\nan absorbed power-law to the data, a second set of 10 000 sim-\nulated spectra was generated. This second set of simulations\nyielded results consistent with the first.\n3.1. GRB 001025A\nThe spectrum for this afterglow is significantly better fit by the\nthermal plasma model than the absorbed power-law (Table 1) \u2013\nonly 13 in 10 000 simulations are as good a fit. While the con-\ntinuum shape dictates that the plasma temperatures in the sim-\nulated spectra will be consistent with each other and with the fit\nL\ne\ntt\ne\nr\nto\nth\ne\nE\nd\nit\no\nr\nD.

Model d) is an ionised reflection model where\nthe emission arises purely from the X-ray flux scattered o\u000b material\nwith twice the solar elemental abundance, also modified by a cold,\nredshifted absorber. In all cases an absorber fixed at the Galactic value\nwas included.

The thermal plasma model fit to the data\nyields a temperature of 3.4 keV and a redshift of 0.53 and does\nnot require super-solar abundance of light metals (Table 2).\nIn order to parameterise the line emission, a power-law\nwith Galactic absorption and Gaussian emission lines was fit\nto the data, allowing the line widths to vary together. For five\nemission lines, the \u001f2 is 40.1 for 55 degrees of freedom, (giv-\ning a null hypothesis probability of 3 \u0002 10\u22124 (3:6\u001b) over the\nabsorbed power-law and 5 \u0002 10\u22127 (5:0\u001b) over a power-law\nwith Galactic absorption. Adding lines to a bremsstrahlung\ncontinuum yielded similar significances, (3 \u0002 10\u22124 (3:6\u001b)\nover the absorbed bremsstrahlung and 2 \u0002 10\u22124 (3:8\u001b) over\na bremsstrahlung with Galactic absorption), though the fit was\nworse, \u001f2 = 45:4 for 55 degrees of freedom.\nThe best-fit energies for the lines are: 4:7+0:8\u22120:4, 2:2 \u0006 0:1,\n1:64 \u0006 0:07, 1:16 \u0006 0:05 and 0:80+0:04\u22120:05 keV with a FWHM\nof 240+70\u221260 eV with individual line significances (null hypoth-\nesis probabilities) of 0.12, 0.02, 8\u000210\u22124, 8\u000210\u22124 and 4\u000210\u22124\nrespectively. Single line significances were determined by us-\ning the best-fit Galactic-absorbed power-law with five Gaussian\nemission lines and removing individual lines to assess their f-\nstatistic. Probabilities were then determined using the f-test.\nThe observed equivalent width is \u0018800 eV for the 4.7 keV line\nand \u0018400 eV for the others. Fitting the K\u000b emission lines of\nMg xii (1.46 keV), Si xiv (1.99 keV), S xvi (2.60 keV), Ar xviii\n(3.30 keV) and 56Ni xxviii (8.10 keV), gives a best-fit redshift\nof 0:7+0:3\u22120:1. This redshift is within two standard deviations of\nthe redshift determined from the thermal plasma fit (Table 2).\nAllowing for an outflow velocity of 0:0\u22120:1 c (Reeves et al.\n2002), we conclude that the redshift of the host galaxy is likely\nto lie in the range 0.5\u20131.2.\nIt has been suggested that reflection of synchrotron emis-\nsion from ionised material could produce the emission lines\nobserved in GRB afterglows (e.g., Ballantyne et al. 2002). An\nionised reflection model is as good a fit to the data as an ab-\nsorbed power-law; however, adding a power-law continuum to\nthe reflection component disimproves the fit significantly, in-\ndicating that the afterglow must be viewed so that little of the\ncontinuum is observed, if this fit is to be acceptable. This im-\nplies a line-of-sight outside the GRB cone, a possibility ruled\nout by the detection of the GRB in the first place. In any case,\nthe ionised pure reflection model does not fit the soft excess as\nwell as the thermal plasma model (Table 1). Modifications to\nthe reflection model (such as including contributions from S,\nAr and Ca) could improve the fit to the data.\n3.2. GRB 010220\nA power-law model with Galactic absorption is an acceptable\nfit to the data, however the single clearest deviation in the spec-\ntrum of GRB 010220 (Fig. 2) is the feature near 3.9 keV; adding\nan unresolved Gaussian line (equivalent width = 1:8+0:8\u22121:2 keV)\nto the power-law fit improves the fit at >99% significance\n(\u001f2 = 7:5 for 13 degrees of freedom) and is the only emission\nfeature in the spectrum. While the relatively poor statistics do\nnot enable us to detect individual emission lines at lower ener-\ngies (e.g. Si or S K\u000b), the thermal plasma model is significantly\npreferred to the absorbed power-law model with a null hypoth-\nesis probability of 0.0016 using statistics from the Monte Carlo\nsimulations. Allowing the abundance of Fe to vary did not sig-\nnificantly improve the thermal plasma fit as the energy of the\nFe K\u000b emission is too low relative to the emission at low ener-\ngies and is not broad enough to fit the excess alone. The best-fit\nFe abundance is consistent with solar abundance; allowing Ni\nto vary improves the fit at >99% confidence as it fits most of\nthe 3.9 keV emission feature.\nThe pure ionised reflection model in this case is a better fit\nthan the absorbed power-law model (Table 1) primarily due to\nfitting Fe emission (at lower redshift than the thermal plasma\nL\ne\ntt\ne\nr\nto\nth\ne\nE\nd\nit\no\nr\nL4 D.

Discussion\nIt is clear that for the X-ray afterglows of GRBs 001025A\nand 010220, the type of collisionally-ionised plasma model fit\nto the afterglow of GRB 011211 (Reeves et al. 2002) is a bet-\nter fit to the data than an absorbed power-law. The detection\nof a thermal spectrum in three GRB afterglows with XMM-\nNewton indicates that this behaviour is relatively common\nhours to days after the burst among the long duration GRBs.\nFig. 2. EPIC-pn spectrum of the afterglow of GRB 010220, 20 ks ex-\nposure, fit with a power-law with Galactic absorption.\nThermal emission may therefore make a significant contribu-\ntion to the total afterglow luminosity of a GRB. It is worth\nnoting that these are among the best quality soft X-ray spec-\ntra of GRB afterglows recorded to date and the absence of\ndetection of such thermal spectra with BeppoSAX is not supris-\ning given XMM-Newton\u2019s much greater sensitivity and bet-\nter spectral resolution and the relatively high low-energy cut-\no\u000b of the MECS instrument (\u00182 keV). A re-examination of\nthe ASCA, BeppoSAX and Chandra data of the afterglows of\nGRBs 970508, 970828 (where the 5.04 keV feature could be\ncaused by blueshifted 56Ni K\u000b emission blueshifted by 0.2c),\n991216, 990705 and 000214 may be worthwhile in the light of\nthese results.\nIn none of the three cases (GRBs 001025A, 010220\nand 011211) is an excess abundance of Fe required and in both\nafterglow spectra reported here a large over-abundance of Ni\n(or possibly Co) is required, consistent with the idea that the\nSN\u2013GRB lag must be of the order of days, not months, though\nit is worth noting that this timescale can be extended where the\nmaterial is ionised (McLaughlin & Wijers 2002).\nUsing the model proposed by Reeves et al. (2002) to ex-\nplain the observations of GRB 011211 it is di\u000ecult to place\nprecise limits on the size of the SN shell, the expansion speed\nand the time delay between the burst and the initial SN from\nthe spectra of these afterglows as the redshifts of the host\ngalaxies are unknown and the redshifts derived from the X-ray\nspectra are not as tightly constrained as in GRB 011211. It\nis possible however, to constrain the minimum radius of the\nSN ejecta shell and its mass on the assumption that the dura-\ntion of the thermal emission is due primarily to light-crossing\ntime over the illuminated shell. With no collimation of the GRB\nand where the thermal emission lasts at least as long as the\ntime between the burst and the afterglow observation (\u00187\nand 30 hours), the minimum shell radii are 8 \u0002 1014 cm and\n3 \u0002 1015 cm corresponding to SN-GRB delays of at least 3\nand 12 days for GRB 010220 and GRB 001025A respectively\nand illuminated shell masses of 0.9 and 1.1 M\f using the best fit\nemission measure, temperature and redshifts from the MEKAL\nmodel. Reeves et al. (2002) calculate a delay of a few days and\nL\ne\ntt\ne\nr\nto\nth\ne\nE\nd\nit\no\nr\nD. Watson et al.: X-ray afterglows of GRBs observed with XMM-Newton L5\nat most two weeks between the SN and the GRB, consistent\nwith these results, though the SN-GRB time delay distribution\nhas so far not been defined. The time delay for GRB 001025A\nis suggestive since the half-life of the most abundant product\nof Si burning, 56Ni, is 6.1 days decaying primarily to 56Co\nwith a half-life of 77.3 days to 56Fe (although see, on half-lives\nof ionised species, McLaughlin & Wijers 2002). In this sce-\nnario, much of the emission observed near 1 keV in the spec-\ntrum of GRB 001025A could then be due to L-shell emission\nfrom 56Co. The spectrum however is not su\u000eciently good to\ninvestigate this possibility.\nRecent analysis of the XMM-Newton spectrum of\nGRB 020322, with a signal to noise ratio comparable to the\nX-ray spectrum of GRB 011211, shows no evidence of emis-\nsion features (Watson et al. in prep.) 15 hours after the burst;\nevidence that if thermal emission occurs in every afterglow, it\nmay be relatively short-lived.\nThe prospect that thermal emission may contribute signifi-\ncantly to the X-ray luminosity of afterglows could resolve the\nproblem of bursts with apparently high X-ray column densities\nbut low optical extinctions, 10\u2013100 times smaller than expected\n(Galama & Wijers 2001). The curvature of low-quality thermal\nX-ray spectra can be approximated by an absorbed power-law,\ngiving much larger absorbing columns than are required by the\nthermal spectra.\nAnother implication of the data reported here is that GRBs\nwithout significant optical emission, \u201cdark GRBs\u201d (Reichart &\nYost 2001; Djorgovski et al. 2001), may not always need to\nhave significant extinction (Taylor et al. 2000; Reichart & Yost\n2001; Piro et al. 2002), be intrinsically di\u000berent (Lazzati et al.\n2002) or be very distant (Lamb & Reichart 2000). A soft X-ray\nspectrum dominated by thermal emission will lead to an over-\nestimation of the expected optical flux where this is predicted\nassuming a synchrotron-dominated X-ray flux below 10 keV\n(Djorgovski et al. 2001).\n5. Conclusions\nXMM-Newton detected the afterglows of GRB 001025A and\nGRB 010220 the former showing a decaying lightcurve.\nPositions accurate to \u0018100 were determined; this makes it fea-\nsible for optical spectroscopy to be used to confirm the X-ray\nredshift reported in this paper for the host galaxies of these\nGRBs, in particular for the host of GRB 001025A, where the\nextinction is relatively low. In both cases, the X-ray spectra\nare significantly better fit by the thermal plasma model pro-\nposed by Reeves et al. (2002) to explain the line features in\nGRB 011211 than by an absorbed power-law and in the case\nof GRB 001025A the thermal plasma model is a significantly\nbetter fit than an ionised reflection model. The parameters de-\ntermined from these thermal fits are consistent with their sug-\ngested scenario. It seems likely that a large contribution from\nhighly-ionised light metals is a common feature in the X-ray\nspectra of GRB afterglows hours to days after the burst and\nthe detection of thermal emission in three of the four XMM-\nNewton\u2013detected afterglows implies that this may be a signif-\nicant component in the total afterglow luminosity of all long\nGRBs.\nReferences\nAltieri, B., Schartel, N., Lumb, D., Piro, L., & Parmar, A. 2000a, GRB\nCoordinates Network Circular, 884\nAltieri, B., Schartel, N., Santos, M., et al. 2000b, GRB Coordinates\nNetwork Circular, 869\nAntonelli, L.
