Individuals with a central deposition of\nadipose tissue display elevated cardiovascular morbidity and\nmortality, including stroke, congestive heart failure, myocardial\ninfarction and cardiovascular death, and this is independent of the\nassociation between obesity and other cardiovascular risk factors\n[2]. Obesity, in particular abdominal obesity, was pointed out as a\nprimary contributor to acquired insulin resistance, as increasing\nadiposity is correlated with impaired insulin action [3]. Endothelial\ndysfunction, an independent predictor of cardiovascular events\n[4], has been consistently associated with obesity and the\nmetabolic syndrome [5] in a complex interplay with insulin\nresistance [6]. Deficiency of endothelial nitric oxide (NO) is\nbelieved to be the primary defect that links insulin resistance and\nendothelial dysfunction [7].\nEpidemiological studies report an inverse association between\ndietary polyphenol consumption and mortality from cardiovascu-\nlar diseases [8]. In the past decade, red wine polyphenolic\ncompounds, including ProvinolsTM, have been shown to exert\nnumerous biological effects that might participate in cardio- and\nvasculo-protection. Polyphenols possess anti-aggregatory platelet\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 May 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 5 | e5557\nactivity, antioxidant and free radical scavenging properties [9,10].\nFurthermore, red wine and its polyphenolic constituents possess\nlipid- and lipoprotein-lowering effects [9]. Moreover, ProvinolsTM\nis a powerful vasodilator through the generation of NO and can\nact on the expression of genes protective of the cardiovascular\nsystem [11]. Due to these pleiotropic properties, polyphenols may\nbe good candidates to correct metabolic and cardiovascular\nalterations associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome.\nIn the present work, we studied the potential beneficial effects of\ndietary supplementation of the red wine polyphenol extract,\nProvinolsTM, in an experimental model of obesity and metabolic\nsyndrome with an emphasis on glucose and lipid metabolisms,\ncardiac and endothelial functions. Of particular interest is to study\nthe cellular pathways related to nitrosative and oxidative stresses in\nblood vessels. For this purpose, we used the Zucker fatty (ZF) rat, a\nwidely used animal model of obesity and type 2 diabetes, which\npresents many of the human metabolic syndrome features such as\ninsulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hyperinsulinemia [12,13] and, in\nsome colonies, hypertension that develops by 4\u20135 months of age\n[14]. On the other hand, their lean littermates are insulin-sensitive,\nnormoinsulinemic, normotensive, and have normal lipid profiles\nand glucose tolerance. Furthermore, this model presents a loss of\nfunctional mutation in the leptin receptor [15,16].\nMethods\nAnimals and experimental protocol\nThe university of Angers ethical committee approved the\npresent protocol. All animal studies were carried out using\napproved institutional protocols and were conformed the Guide\nfor the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by US National\nInstitutes of Health (NIH Publication No. 85-23, revised 1996).\nTwenty-four ZF rats and twelve of their lean littermate non-obese\nrats (Charles River; L\u2019Arbresle, France) received for eight weeks\neither a control diet or a diet containing ProvinolsTM (Socie\u00b4te\u00b4\nFranc\u00b8aise de Distilleries; Vallon Pont d\u2019Arc, France) at the dose of\n20 mg\/kg\/day. The dose of ProvinolsTM was described to induce\ncardiovascular effects, including improvement of endothelial\nfunction [17] and prevention of the increase in blood pressure in\nNO-deficient hypertensive rats [18] and protection of both cardiac\nischemia [19] and stroke [20]. Eight weeks of treatment has been\nreported to protect against deleterious effects of hypertension [21]\nand chronic-stress exposure [22].\nMeasurement of blood pressure\nBlood pressure was measured using the tail-cuff technique\nweekly. Each rat was trained to the tail-cuff technique for 2 days\nbefore each measurement recorded with a Physiograph Desk\nModel and an Electro-Sphygmomanometer (BIOSEB; Paris,\nFrance). Five separate measurements were made on conscious\nrats for systolic blood pressure and heart rate determinations.\nEchocardiographic examination\nTransthoracic echocardiography was performed using an ATL-\nHDI 5500 ultrasound machine equipped with a 8-MHz imaging\ntransducer in rats anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (50 mg\/\nkg ip). Briefly, a two-dimensional short axis view of the left\nventricle was obtained at the level of the papillary muscle in order\nto record M-mode tracings. Diastolic left ventricular dimension\n(LVDd) and systolic left ventricular dimension (LVDs) were\nmeasured by the American Society of Echocardiology leading-\nedge method from at least 3 consecutive cardiac cycles. Doppler\ncardiac output was calculated by the following formula: Cardiac\noutput = 6D2\/46IVTAo, where D represents the diameter of\nthe aortic left ventricular outflow tract and IVTAo the velocity-\ntime integral in the left ventricular outflow tract. Also, total arterial\nperipheral resistances were calculated from blood pressure and\ncardiac output.\nCirculating parameters measurement\nRats were anesthetized with isoflurane and blood was harvested\nfrom abdominal aorta. The plasma was separated for circulating\nglucose, fructosamine, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein\n(LDL)-cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol,\ntriglycerides, creatinin, and uric acid analysis (technical platform\nof Toulouse Midi-Pyre\u00b4ne\u00b4es GenopoleH IFR31; Toulouse, France).\nVascular reactivity\nAortic and small mesenteric artery (SMA) rings (1.5\u20132 mm long)\nwere obtained from ZF and lean rats having received ProvinolsTM\nor a vehicle. Then, they were mounted on a wire myograph\n(Danish MyoTechnology, Aarhus, Denmark) filled with physio-\nlogical salt solution (PSS) as previously described [23]. Endothe-\nlium-dependent vasodilatation in response to acetylcholine (Ach,\n1 nM to 10 mM) was studied in aortas and SMA with functional\nendothelium pre-contracted with the thromboxane A2 agonist (9,\n11-dideoxy-11a, 9a-epoxymethanoprostaglandin F2-a) U46619\n(Sigma-Aldrich; St. Quentin, Fallavier, France) at 80% of their\nmaximal response. In SMA from ZF rats the different components\nof the vaso-relaxation were determined as follows: the NO-\ndependent dilation was measured in the presence of a non selective\ncyclo-oxygenase (COX) inhibitor, indomethacin, (INDO,\n100 mM; Sigma-Aldrich), apamin (100 nM; Sigma-Aldrich) and\ncharybdotoxin (50 nM; Sigma-Aldrich). The endothelium-derived\nhyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) component was assessed in the\npresence of the NO synthase inhibitor Nv-Nitro-L-arginine methyl\nester (L-NAME, 100 mM; Sigma-Aldrich) and INDO (100 mM).\nNitric oxide (NO) and superoxide anion (O2\n2)\ndetermination by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)\nAortas, carotid arteries and SMA were dissected and incubated\nfor NO production for 30 min in Krebs\u2013Hepes buffer containing:\nBSA (20.5 g\/L), CaCl2 (3 mM) and L-Arginine (0.8 mM) (Sigma-\nAldrich). NaDETC (1.5 mM) and FeSO4.7H2O (1.5 mM) (Sigma-\nAldrich) were separately dissolved under argon gas bubbling in\n10 mL volumes of ice-cold Krebs\u2013Hepes buffer. These were\nrapidly mixed to obtain a pale yellow-brown opalescent colloid\nFe(DETC)2 solution (0.4 mM), which was used immediately. The\ncolloid Fe(DETC)2 solution was added to vessels and incubated for\n45 minutes at 37uC. Then, arteries were immediately frozen in\nplastic tubes using liquid N2. NO measurement was performed on\na table-top x-band spectrometer Miniscope (Magnettech, MS200;\nBerlin, Germany). Recordings were made at 77uK, using a Dewar\nflask. Instrument settings were 10 mW of microwave power, 1 mT\nof amplitude modulation, 100 kHz of modulation frequency, 150 s\nof sweep time and 3 scans. Signals were quantified by measuring\nthe total amplitude, after correction of baseline as done previously\n[23]. Values are expressed in unit\/mg weight of dried tissue.\nFor O2\n2 spin-trapping, aortas, carotid arteries and SMA were\ndissected and allowed to equilibrate in deferoxamine-chelated\nKrebs-Hepes solution containing 1-hydroxy-3methoxycarbonyl-\n2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrrolidin (CMH, Noxygen; Denzlingen, Ger-\nmany) (500 mM), deferoxamin (25 mM, Sigma-Aldrich) and\nDETC (5 mM, Sigma-Aldrich) under constant temperature\n(37uC) for 60 minutes. Then, they were frozen in liquid N2 and\nanalyzed in a Dewar flask by EPR. Values are expressed in unit\/\nmg weight of dried tissue.\nPolyphenols and Obesity\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 May 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 5 | e5557\nWestern Blotting\nAorta was dissected, homogenized and lysed. Proteins (80 mg)\nwere separated on 10% SDS-PAGE. Blots were probed with anti-\nendothelial NOS (eNOS), anti-phospho-eNOS Ser 1177, anti-\nphospho-eNOS Thr 495 (Cell Signaling; Beverly, MA), anti-\ncaveolin-1 (BD Biosciences; San Jose, CA), Mn-superoxide\ndismutase (SOD), Cu\/Zn-SOD, extracellular (Ec)-SOD (Stressgen\nBiotechnologies Corporation; Victoria, Canada), anti-gp91phox\n(Nox-2; BD Biosciences), anti-Nox-1 and anti-Nox-4 antibodies.\nData analysis\nData are expressed as mean6SEM, and n represents the\nnumber of experiences. Statistical analyses were performed using a\none way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and Mann-Whitney U\ntests or ANOVA for repeated measures and subsequent Bonfer-\nroni post hoc test. P,0.05 was considered to be statistically\nsignificant.\nResults\nProvinolsTM improve circulating parameters in ZF rats\nZF rats weighed significantly more than their lean controls and\nProvinolsTM treatment did not affect body weight of either group\n(data not shown).\nAs expected, ZF rats exhibited high glucose and fructosamine\nlevels compared to their lean littermates (Figure 1A, 1B).\nInterestingly, ProvinolsTM normalized both glycemia and fructo-\nsamine levels in ZF rats, suggesting an improvement in whole-\nbody glucose homeostasis [24]. In addition, ZF rats displayed a\nhigh circulating level of total cholesterol (Figure 1C) as well as an\nelevated ratio between LDL- and HDL-cholesterol (Figure 1D)\ncompared to lean rats. Interestingly, these two parameters were\nsignificantly improved by the ProvinolsTM treatment in ZF rats.\nMoreover, ZF rats exhibited high levels of circulating triglycerides\ncompared to lean littermates (Figure 1E), and ProvinolsTM\ntreatment significantly reduced triglyceride level in these animals.\nFigure 1. ProvinolsTM improve metabolic parameters in ZF rats. Circulating levels of glucose (A), fructosamine (B), total cholesterol (C), ratio\nbetween LDL- and HDL-cholesterol (D), triglygerides (E), creatinin (F) and uric acid (G) were evaluated in fasting plasma of rats.

We found that ZF rats\ndisplayed a reduced diastolic left ventricular dimension (LVDd)\n(Figure 2A) compared to lean controls, even though the systolic left\nventricular dimension (LVDs) remained the same (Figure 2B).\nInterestingly, ProvinolsTM reduced LVDs without affecting LVDd\nin ZF rats compared to the lean littermates (Figure 2A and 2B), and\nthus, increased left ventricular fractional shortening.\nMoreover, we observed that although the ZF rats presented no\ndifference in cardiac output compared to lean rats (Figure 2C);\nthey exhibited a decreased fraction of ejection (Figure 2D).\nImportantly, ProvinolsTM enhanced cardiac output in ZF rats\n(Figure 2C) and increased the fraction of ejection (Figure 2D) in\ncomparison to their controls.\nIn addition, we found that ProvinolsTM significantly decreased\narterial peripheral resistance in ZF rats (Figure 2E), while the systolic\nblood pressure remained the same in both groups of rats (Figure 2F).\nProvinolsTM improve endothelial function in both aortas\nand small mesenteric arteries (SMA) from ZF rats\nEndothelial dysfunction, which is a key early factor in the\ndevelopment of atherosclerosis and a predictor of cardiovascular\nevents, has been found in patients with obesity and metabolic\nsyndrome [5,25]. Thus, we evaluated the endothelial function in\nboth conductance (aorta) and resistance (SMA) arteries from ZF\nrats and evaluated the potential protective effect of ProvinolsTM.\nAs shown in Figure 3A, aortic rings from ZF rats had reduced\nendothelium-dependent vasodilator responses to Ach compared to\naortic rings from lean controls. Interestingly, ProvinolsTM\nsignificantly corrected this impairment in endothelium-dependent\nrelaxation in aortas from ZF rats (Figure 3A).\nIn SMA, endothelium-dependent relaxation was the same in all\nfour groups (Figure 3B). To get further insight in the component\nthat may be affected upon ProvinolsTM treatment, we analyzed the\neffect of pharmacological inhibitors in SMA from ZF rats only.\nInterestingly, while ProvinolsTM did not affect the NO-component\nof the response to Ach agonist (Figure 3C), it markedly enhanced\nits EDHF-component in SMA taken from ZF rats (Figure 3D)\ncompared to non-treated ZF rats.\nAltogether, these findings indicate that ProvinolsTM improve\nendothelial function in aortas from ZF rats and in SMA in\nresponse to pharmacological stimuli.\nProvinolsTM increase arterial NO release in ZF rats by\nactivating eNOS\nGiven the important role of NO in the mediation of\nendothelium-dependent relaxation in vessels, we evaluated here\nthe molecular pathways implicated to its production upon\nProvinolsTM treatment in different arteries.\nTreatment of ZF rats with ProvinolsTM increased NO production\nin aorta (Figure 4A), carotid artery (Figure 4B) and SMA\n(Figure 4C), suggesting that the improvement in endothelial\nFigure 2.

In order to assess the mechanism(s) of NO\nrelease, we studied the NO signaling pathway in rat aorta. Although\nthe ProvinolsTM treatment did not modify either expression\n(Figure 4D) nor phosphorylation of eNOS at the inhibitor site\n(Thr 495, Figure 4E), it significantly enhanced its phosphorylation at\nthe activator site (Ser 1177, Figure 4F), suggesting that ProvinolsTM\nenhanced eNOS activity. Importantly, ProvinolsTM reduced\nexpression of caveolin-1 (Figure 4G), a protein known to inactivate\neNOS by cell membrane sequestration.\nProvinolsTM decrease arterial O2\n2 release in ZF rats by\ndecreasing the expression of the Nox-1 subunit of\nNADPH oxidase\nOxidative stress, which is one of the causative factors of\nendothelial dysfunction, is thought to play a major role in the\noccurrence and complications of obesity and metabolic syndrome\n[26]. Hence, we evaluated the vascular production of O2\n2 in ZF\nrats and its modulation by ProvinolsTM treatment.\nEPR study demonstrated that ProvinolsTM significantly reduced\nO2\n2 production in aorta (Figure 5A), carotid arteries (Figure 5B)\nand SMA (Figure 5C) from ZF rats, indicating a decrease in\noxidative stress favorable to an increase in NO bio-availability.\nWe evaluated the expression of membrane subunits of NADPH\noxidase (Nox-1, Nox-2 and Nox-4), a major source of cellular O2\n2,\nin aortas from ZF rats. ProvinolsTM treatment reduced the\nexpression of Nox-1 subunit (Figure 5D) without affecting that of\nNox-2 or Nox-4 (Figure 5E, 5F). To evaluate the effect of\nProvinolsTM on the vascular capacity to dismutate O2\n2, we\nexamined expression of different isoforms of superoxide dismutase\n(SOD). ProvinolsTM did not significantly modify Mn-SOD, Cu\/\nZn-SOD or Ec-SOD expressions (Figure 5G\u20135I).\nDiscussion\nIn the present study, we demonstrate that ProvinolsTM leads to an\nimprovement of glucose and lipid metabolism in ZF rats, enhances\ncardiac function and decreases peripheral resistance. In addition,\nProvinolsTM improves endothelium-dependent relaxation in both\naorta and SMA from ZF rats and this is accompanied with an\nincrease of vascular NO production and with a decrease of O2\n2\nrelease, resulting in an increase of NO bioavailability. These effects\nare associated with an increase in eNOS activity, and a decrease in\ncaveolin-1 expression, in addition to a decreased expression of Nox-\n1 NADPH oxidase subunit. Interestingly, these results show that\nProvinolsTM leads to an overall improvement of obesity-associated\nalterations, including glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as\nendothelial and cardiac functions, by mechanisms not related to\nthose linked to a decrease of body weight gain in ZF rats.\nHere, we provide evidence that ProvinolsTM treatment was\neffective in acting on the parameters linked to insulin resistance\nFigure 3.

Acetylcholine (Ach)-induced relaxation in rat aorta (A), small mesenteric\narteries (SMA) (B), SMA in the presence of inhibitors of EDHF and COX components (C) (apamine, APA; charybdotoxin, CTX; indomethacin, INDO), SMA\nin the presence of inhibitors of NO and COX components (D) (INDO, L-NAME).

These effects most likely reduced the deleterious\nconsequences of increased glycaemia, including the formation of\nadvanced glycosylated end products that not only increase oxidative\nstress but also induce endothelial dysfunction. In accordance with\nthe present study, other compounds, such as resveratrol, present in\nred wine exhibit hypoglycaemic effects in streptozotocin-induced\ndiabetic rats [27] and in obese ZF rats [28]. Moreover, Napoli et al.\n[29] showed that red wine consumption improves insulin resistance\nin type 2 diabetic patients.\nWith regard to lipid lowering properties of ProvinolsTM, the\npresent study shows that ProvinolsTM reduced circulating\ntriglycerides and total cholesterol levels, as well as the ratio\nbetween LDL- and HDL-cholesterol in ZF rats compared to lean\ncontrols. Some animal studies suggest that polyphenols may\nreduce cholesterol absorption due to the interaction of these\ncompounds with cholesterol carriers and transporters present\nacross the brush border membrane [30,31]. Very recently, Rivera\net al. [28] have shown that long-term resveratrol administration\nreduces plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels in ZF rats. Also,\nVinson et al. [32] reported that red wine polyphenol compounds\nor grape juices reduce the plasma concentration of lipids in\nhamsters. This is consistent with the study in humans, in which\nshort-term ingestion of purple grape juice has been shown to\nreduce LDL susceptibility to oxidation in patients with coronary\nartery disease [33]. Indeed, consumption of red wine also reduces\nLDL oxidation leading to limited plaque formation in humans\n[34]. LDL oxidation was not assessed here but we clearly\ndemonstrated that ProvinolsTM improves the balance between\nLDL- and HDL-cholesterol in obese rats.\nIn regards to the structure and function of the left ventricle of\nZF rats, we showed that ProvinolsTM reduced the LVDs without\naffecting the LVDd and thus improved fractional shortening. Lee\nand coworkers [35] suggested that ZF rats exhibited reduced\nLVDs and LVDd compared to their lean littermates; however, the\nfractional shortening was not different amongst the two groups.\nThe improvement in LVDs and fractional shortening induced by\nProvinolsTM was also accompanied with an increase in fraction of\nejection and cardiac output, illustrating an improvement in systolic\nfunction. In addition, ProvinolsTM reduced total arterial periph-\neral resistance leading to the absence of modification in blood\npressure. Altogether, these findings highlight the beneficial effects\nof ProvinolsTM on cardiac function inasmuch cardiomyopathic\nchanges are noted in obesity although it cannot be isolated and\nattributed to any specific factor, such as volume overload,\noxidative stress, blood pressure changes, or other unclear factors.\nEndothelial dysfunction and hypertension are closely related to\nobesity and\/or insulin resistance [36]. Although many studies\nreported that the endothelium-dependent relaxation in response to\nAch is paradoxically preserved or even enhanced in ZF rats\nrelative to their lean littermates [37], impaired Ach-induced\nvasodilatation has also been described [38]. Numerous investiga-\ntions have indicated that red wines, grape juices, red wine\npolyphenolic and grape skin extracts are potent endothelium-\ndependent vasodilators [9,10,39]. Herein, we demonstrated that\nthe Ach-induced relaxation was impaired in aortas from ZF rats\ncompared to lean controls, and importantly was completely\ncorrected by ProvinolsTM treatment. This improvement in\nendothelial function was attributable to the increase in NO bio-\navailability as given by the concomitant increase in NO and\ndecrease in O2\n2 releases in vessels taken from ProvinolsTM-treated\nZF rats compared to non-treated ZF rats. In accordance with our\nprevious study [40], ProvinolsTM treatment enhanced activity of\neNOS and decreased the expression of caveolin-1, a protein\nknown to sequestrate eNOS. In addition, we showed here that\nProvinolsTM decreases NADPH oxidase Nox-1 subunit expression,\nleading to a decrease in O2\n2 release from aorta. In agreement with\nour data, Sarr et al. [41] reported that red wine polyphenols\nprevented the angiotensin II-induced expression of Nox-1 subunit\nin rat aorta.\nFigure 4. ProvinolsTM increase NO vascular release in vessels from ZF rats.

Blockade of COX and EDHF components using INDO\nand charybdotoxin plus apamin, reduced the response to Ach in\nboth groups of ZF rats to the same extent, even though the bio-\navailability of NO was increased in vessels from ProvinolsTM-\ntreated animals, suggesting that the amount of NO released in\nnon-treated ZF rats is sufficient to induce the maximal effect.\nInterestingly, when the NO and COX components were inhibited\nusing INDO and L-NAME, the endothelium-dependent relaxa-\ntion in response to Ach was decreased in ZF versus ProvinolsTM-\ntreated ZF rats suggesting that ProvinolsTM treatment increases\nEDHF-mediated relaxation in SMA. Previous studies have shown\nthat red wine polyphenols induced EDHF-dependent relaxation in\nporcine coronary arteries [39,42]. These results underlined an\nincreased EDHF contribution on Ach response upon ProvinolsTM\nafter blockade of both NO and COX pathways as a possible\ncompensatory mechanism in the same way to those shown in our\nprevious studies in human resistance arteries [43].\nThe treatment of metabolic diseases and obesity-related\ncomplications are currently based on the treatment of their\nindividual components, e.g. hypertension and insulin resistance.\nDue to the multi-factorial properties of ProvinolsTM, they may be\na good candidate for prevention and treatment of metabolic\nsyndrome and reduction of cardiovascular risk. Our present study\nprovides strong evidence for beneficial effects of red wine\npolyphenols on both, vascular and cardiac functions in ZF rats,\nsuggesting that they may therefore be of therapeutic benefit in the\nfuture and may represent a new class of medicinal products against\nobesity-associated diseases.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank A.
