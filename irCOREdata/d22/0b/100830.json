INTRODUCTION\nThe nucleation of a new bulk phase almost always oc-\ncurs via heterogeneous nucleation: the nucleus of the new\nphase forms not in the bulk but at a surface.1 The barrier to\nnucleation is typically much lower at the surface than in the\nbulk. Because nucleation occurs at a surface, the surfaces\npresent can control how a new bulk phase nucleates. Now,\nbulk phase transitions are not the only phase transitions;\nthere are also surface phase transitions. Of course, nucleation\nat a first-order surface transition will also occur at a surface.\nHere we consider a simple system with both a bulk and a\nsurface transition, and find that near the bulk transition the\nnuclei of the new surface and bulk phases appear indistin-\nguishable. Bulk and surface phases are clearly distinct: a\nsurface phase transition only affects the surface\u2014it does not\nreach into the bulk. However, the nucleus of a new phase is\nonly microscopic; indeed they are typically only a few mol-\necules or spins across. Thus it appears that this small nucleus\ndoes not \u201cknow\u201d whether it will grow to form a thick wetting\nlayer or a bulk phase \u0001both are much thicker than it is\u0002.\nSimulation snapshots of nuclei for bulk and surface tran-\nsitions are shown in Fig. 1. They are very similar. We expect\nthat the continuity of the nucleation of surface and bulk tran-\nsitions is generic. Therefore we have chosen to simulate per-\nhaps the simplest model system. This is the three-\ndimensional Ising model;2,3 we take a variant with a surface\nfield and with a coupling between spins at the surface that is\ndifferent from that in the bulk. See Refs. 4\u20136 for earlier work\non the phase diagram of this model. In the following section\nwe will describe both the model and our simulation method-\nology. In Sec. III we describe the equilibrium phase behavior\nof this model at the one temperature we study. This is a\nnecessary prerequisite to a study of nucleation. Then in Sec.\nIV we present our detailed results for nucleation. Our final\nsection is a conclusion.\nWe were inspired to work on nucleation in a system with\nbulk and surface phase transitions, by work on hard spheres\nat a smooth hard wall.

Hard spheres at a hard wall\nhave been extensively studied over the past 15 years, starting\nwith the pioneering work of Courtemanche et al.7,8 More\nrecent work by Dijkstra and co-workers9\u201311 and by Laird and\nco-workers12\u201314 focused on whether or not wetting occurs,\nand also found hysteresis \u0001evidence for a first-order surface\ntransition\u0002. In addition Auer and Frenkel15 studied nucleation\nof the bulk crystal at a hard wall. If the analogy between the\nphase behavior in the two systems extends to the nucleation\nbehavior, then the results we obtain here can be used to pre-\ndict the qualitative nature of nucleation of bulk and surface\ncrystalline phases of hard spheres at a hard wall.\nII. MODEL AND SIMULATION TECHNIQUE\nWe are interested in a generic question, which is as fol-\nlows. Consider a system with nearby first-order surface and\nbulk phase transitions. In this system consider the nucleation\nof both the new bulk phase and of the new surface phase,\nwhich looks approximately like a few layers of the new bulk\nphase. Now, if we vary a parameter such as the magnetic\nfield, or the temperature, we can cross the bulk transition at\nwhich point the new phase nucleating changes discontinu-\nously from being a new surface phase to being a new bulk\nphase. The question then is: Does the nucleus and nucleation\nrate change discontinuously when the phase that is formed\nchanges? We will show that within the precision of our cal-\nculations, the answer is no.\nAs we are interested in a generic question, we should be\nable to choose any convenient model. Therefore, we take\nperhaps the simplest model that has first-order bulk and sur-\nface phase transitions. This is the Ising model. We study the\nthree-dimensional Ising model on a simple cubic lattice with\nnearest-neighbor interactions.2,3,16\nWe study lattices of size L\u0002L\u0002W. For our calculations\nof the nucleation rate, we consider a lattice with one wall that\nfavors the spin-up phase and one wall that favors the spin-\ndown phase. These walls are flat and the wall that favors the\nspin-up phase is the z=0 plane. For our calculations of iso-\ntherms, we consider a symmetric system in which both walls\nfavor the spin-up phase. These walls are the z=0 and z=W\n+1 planes. There are periodic boundary conditions in the x\nand y directions. For nucleation calculations we take W large\nenough that nucleation on the wall at z=0 is unaffected by\nthe wall at z=W+1. For isotherm calculations we take W\nlarge enough that the surface phases on the two walls are far\nenough apart that they are independent.\nIn the bulk the Ising model is a textbook model.2,3 There,\nneighboring spins interact with a coupling of J and feel a\nbulk field h. At a wall that favors the spin-up phase, the spins\nfeel a surface field hs. This is in addition to h and acts only\non spins immediately adjacent to the wall. Pairs of spins at\nwalls that favor the spin-up phase also have a different cou-\npling, Js not J. For a wall that favors the spin-down phase,\nwe leave the spin coupling at its value in the bulk and im-\npose a surface field of \u2212J to favor the spin-down phase. This\neliminates nucleation at these walls. This extension of the\nbulk Ising model to study surface phase behavior was previ-\nously studied by Binder and co-workers.4\u20136\nWe run our simulations at constant values of fields h and\nhs, and variable numbers of up spins. Then the appropriate\nweight of a state is exp\u0001\u2212H \/kT\u0002, with H\u0001h ,hs ,J ,Js\u0002 given by\nH = \u2212 J\u0005\ni,j\n\u0001SiSj \u2212 Js\u0005\ni,j\n\u0002SiSj \u2212 h\u0005\ni\nSi \u2212 hs\u0005\ni\n\u0003Si, \u00011\u0002\nwhere Si=\u00031 is the spin on site i. The sum with one prime\nis over all pairs of neighboring spins, except those in which\nboth spins are next to a wall. The sum with two primes is\nover all pairs of spins, both of which are adjacent to a wall.\nFinally, the sum with three primes is over all spins adjacent\nto a wall.\nA. Simulation of nucleation\nOur simulations are with the standard Glauber Metropo-\nlis Monte Carlo dynamics. We pick a spin at random and\nattempt to flip it. If this flip decreases H, we always accept it;\nif the change in H, \u0004H, is positive, we accept the spin flip\nwith probability exp\u0001\u2212\u0004H \/kT\u0002.\nIt is not practicable to run simulations for long enough to\nobserve nucleation when the nucleation rate is small. Thus\nwe use the recently developed forward flux sampling \u0001FFS\u0002\nalgorithm of Allen et al.17,18 This provides a reasonably\nsimple way to calculate the rate RAB of an activated process\nwhere a system starts in one phase, call it phase A, then\ntransforms to another phase, phase B. Phase A is with the\nbulk in the spin-down phase and the surface in the meta-\nstable state without the prewetting transition having oc-\ncurred. A surface in this state is shown in Fig. 2\u0001a\u0002. For h\n\u00050, phase B is a state with the bulk in the spin-down phase\nbut with the prewetting surface transition having occurred.\nThis state is shown in Fig. 2\u0001b\u0002. For h\u00060, phase B is a state\nwith the bulk in the spin-up phase.\nSo that the rate is well defined, we need to precisely\ndefine phases A and B. The spin-down phase will have only\na few up spins; the vast majority of the spins will be down\nspins. When either phase nucleates the number of up spins\nwill increase dramatically. Thus the total number of up spins\nin the system varies rapidly as either transition takes place\nand so it makes a good order parameter; we denote it by \u0007.\nThen we define that phase A is being composed of all states\nwith no more than \u0007A up spins, while phase B consists of all\nstates with at least \u0007B\b\u0007A up spins. Here we define \u0007B to be\nsufficiently large that there is only a negligible probability of\nreturning to phase A. However, it is small enough that the\nnucleating surface and bulk phases both have \b\u0007B up spins.\nThus the value of \u0007B does not distinguish between the sur-\nface and bulk phases. We also run on some simulations to\ndetermine which final phase forms, whether it is a new sur-\nface or bulk phase.\nHaving defined our order parameter, our implementation\nof the FFS algorithm is standard and essentially identical to\nthat in our earlier work.19 In particular we use the same order\nparameter. See Refs. 17\u201319 for further details of the\nalgorithm.\n164510-2 Richard P. Sear J. Chem. Phys. 129, 164510 \u00022008\u0001\nDownloaded 31 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132.

EQUILIBRIUM BEHAVIOR\nThe bulk behavior of the three-dimensional Ising model\nis very well understood. There is a bulk paramagnet-to-\nferromagnet transition at J \/kT=0.222 and h \/kT=0.16 This is\nillustrated in the schematic phase diagram of Fig. 3. The bulk\ntransition is the vertical solid line at h \/kT=0, ending at the\nbulk critical point. Below the critical point there is coexist-\nence at h \/kT=0 between spin-up and spin-down ferromag-\nnetic phases. The surface phase behavior is much more com-\nplicated and is not fully known.4\u20136 It depends on four\nparameters: J \/kT, h \/kT, Js \/kT, and hs \/kT, while the bulk\nbehavior just depends on the first two of these.\nThis work was originally inspired by work on hard\nspheres, in which our best estimate9,14 suggests that the bulk\ncrystal phase wets the wall\/fluid interface and that there is\nhysteresis before wetting\u2014suggesting a first-order surface\ntransition. Thus we want an Ising model in which on increas-\ning h, the sequence of behavior is surface phase transition,\nwetting, and then a bulk phase transition. Wetting is where at\ncoexistence, one bulk phase is interposed between a surface\nand the other bulk phase. See the reviews20,21 for introduc-\ntions to surface phase behavior. If there is wetting by the\nspin-up phase, as coexistence is approached on the spin-\ndown side of the phase transition, the thickness of the layer\nof the spin-up phase adsorbed at the surface diverges. This is\nmeasured by the excess number of up spins per surface lat-\ntice site, \t. Here excess means the difference between the\nnumber of up spins with a surface, and the number in the\nsame volume but without the surface.\nWe vary only h, keeping J, Js, and hs constant. We work\nat a bulk coupling J \/kT=0.35, a surface coupling Js \/kT\n=0.65, and a surface field hs \/kT=0.38. All our results are for\nthese values of J, Js, and hs. \t as a function of h \/kT is shown\nin Fig. 4. The jump in \t at the first-order surface transition is\nclear, as is the divergence in \t as h\u21920 that is characteristic\nof wetting. The surface phase transition is from a phase with\n\t close to 0 to one with \t close to 1, i.e., to a surface phase\nin which approximately a monolayer of adsorbed spins is\nfound at the surface. Snapshots of simulations of both phases\nare shown in Fig. 2.\nNote that we generate a strongly first-order surface tran-\nsition by using a large value of Js \u0001almost twice J\u0002 and that\nthe surface field strongly favors up spins in the surface layer\nof spins. To understand the surface behavior, consider the J\n=0 limit. Then the surface monolayer of spins decouples\nfrom the bulk and undergoes a two-dimensional Ising\nparamagnet-to-ferromagnet transition at Js \/kT=0.44 and h\n+hs=0.22 For temperatures below this the surface monolayer\nis in the spin-down phase for h+hs\u00050 and in the spin-up\nphase for h+hs\u00060.\nWhen J\u00040 the surface monolayer is now coupled to the\nbulk. This does not destroy the surface phase transition but it\ndoes shift it. At our values of J, Js, and hs, it occurs at\nFIG. 2. \u0001Color online\u0002 \u0001a\u0002 and \u0001b\u0002 are simulation snapshots of the two\nsurface phases. They are for the bulk field h \/kT=\u22120.075, which is where\nthese two phases coexist. \u0001a\u0002 is the spin-down surface phase, and \u0001b\u0002 is the\nspin-up surface phase. The phases are separated by what is called \u0001in the\nlanguage of fluids\u0002 a prewetting transition. For clarity only the first four\nlayers \u0001z\u00014\u0002 are shown.

This value was obtained both by\nfinding the point at which the forward and back nucleation\nrates in a relatively small system are equal, and by altering\nthe boundary conditions to remove hysteresis and simulating\nthe system. Finally, note that J \/kT=0.35 is above the rough-\nening temperature,6,23 which is estimated to be close to\nJ \/kT=0.4.\nIn the schematic phase diagram of Fig. 3, the line of\nprewetting transitions is shown by the dashed curve. Note\nthat Fig. 3 is purely schematic; the line of prewetting transi-\ntions must end at a prewetting critical point20 but the tem-\nperature of this point may be above or below the bulk critical\npoint. As the prewetting transition ends at a critical point,\nthen formation of a wetting layer does not have to be via\nnucleation; if T and h are varied so as to take the system\naround the dashed curve, then the wetting layer will appear\ncontinuously.\nIV. NUCLEATION\nBefore we explicitly calculate nucleation rates, let us\nconsider hysteresis. To study this we first started with a sys-\ntem at a field h \/kT=\u22120.2. This was equilibrated in the spin-\ndown phase. The field h \/kT was then increased in a succes-\nsion of steps, each with a size of 0.01. After each step we\nequilibrated at the new value of h \/kT for 10 000 cycles and\nthen averaged for another 10 000 cycles to obtain a value for\n\t. The values of \t are plotted as blue circles in Fig. 4. Note\nthat the prewetting transition did not occur at all; the system\nremained with the surface in the spin-down surface phase\nuntil h \/kT=0.02, at which point the bulk spin-up phase\nnucleated.\nTo observe hysteresis in the other direction, we started\nwith a system with h \/kT slightly negative but with the sur-\nface spin-up phase present. We set h \/kT slightly negative\nbecause at h=0 the wetting layer has divergent thickness,\nand this would not fit into our simulation box. We then de-\ncreased h \/kT in steps of 0.01, equilibrating and averaging as\nbefore, to obtain the red crosses in Fig. 4. Note that on the\ndecreasing-h isotherm when h \/kT reaches \u22120.16, the surface\nadsorbed layer becomes unstable and evaporates. The\nspin-up surface phase becomes unstable here.\nWe used the FFS algorithm to calculate nucleation rates.\nWe start with a configuration in which all spins are down,\nand then equilibrate in the metastable state at the required\nvalue of h \/kT. Thus our starting states resemble the snapshot\nof Fig. 2\u0001a\u0002. At each value of h \/kT, we performed 5 runs and\nin each run there were 3000 configurations at each interface.\nA FFS run consists of first determining the flux leaving phase\nA and storing 3000 configurations that have left A. Then the\nprobability of systems starting from these configurations go-\ning forward toward phase B is calculated in a stepwise man-\nner. See Refs. 17 and 19 for details. We obtained the mean\nand standard deviations of the logs of the rates. The results\nare plotted in Fig. 5. We checked which phase the final con-\nfiguration will grow into, by running on a simulation starting\nfrom this configuration. In all cases it grew into a surface\nwetting layer for h\u00050 and into a bulk spin-up phase for h\n\u00060. We are not aware of any study of nucleation at a surface\nin this model, although Pan and Chandler24 studied nucle-\nation in the bulk of the three-dimensional Ising model.\nNo discontinuity in either the rate or its derivative is\nvisible at h=0. Indeed the nucleation rate is well fit by a\ncontinuous function \u0001red curve\u0002 of the form of classical\nnucleation theory for two-dimensional nucleation. Snapshots\nof nuclei near the top on the barrier on either side of h=0 are\nshown in Fig. 1: there is no obvious significant difference\nbetween the two. From runs at h \/kT=\u22120.005 and 0.005, we\nobtained 142 and 124 critical nuclei, respectively. Here a\ncritical nucleus is defined as being one that has a value of the\ncommittor between 0.495 and 0.505. The committor for a\nspin configuration is the probability that in an unconstrained\nsimulation started from this configuration, the simulation\nreaches phase B \u0001the nucleating phase\u0002 before phase A. To\ndetermine the committor we run 200 simulations from each\npotential critical nucleus configuration.\nAt h \/kT=\u22120.005 the number of up spins in the critical\nnuclei configurations was 490\u000320 \u0001mean\u0003standard\u0002 devia-\ntion. Here \u0007A, the maximum number of up spins in the meta-\nstable phase, was set at 370. Thus, the mean increase in the\nnumber of up spins required to reach the critical configura-\ntion is 101. At h \/kT=0.005 the number of up spins in the\ncritical nuclei configurations was 472\u000317. Here \u0007A, the\nmaximum number of up spins in the metastable phase, was\nset at 380. Thus, the average increase in the number of up\nspins in the critical configuration is 92. The numbers of up\nspins in the surface layer were 116\u00037 and 103\u00038 at\nh \/kT=\u22120.005 and 0.005, respectively, again very similar\nnumbers. Thus we conclude that although as h increases be-\nyond zero, the phase that is nucleating changes, the nucleus\nnear the top of the barrier does not \u201cknow\u201d this, and so is\nunaffected.\nIt is interesting to note that the nucleation rate precisely\nat coexistence is a finite, nonzero number. A naive applica-\ntion of classical nucleation theory would suggest that here\nthe nucleation barrier for the new bulk phase would be zero\nif there is wetting, or infinite if the contact angle is nonzero.\nLiquid mixtures, such as methanol\/cyclohexane,20,25 have\nbeen studied, which have phase diagram analogous to that of\nour model.

Thus our finding of a non-\nzero, finite nucleation rate at coexistence is not novel. How-\never, our results may be useful in understanding the micro-\nscopic physics that underlies these experimental\nobservations. As our study is the first simulation study, it\nprovides the first exact results for the nucleus of a new wet-\nting layer. Earlier theoretical work is reviewed by Bonn and\nRoss.20\nFinally, we note that if we start with a system with h\nlarge and negative and increase h \/kT at some fixed rate, then\ndepending on this rate the surface may or may not have time\nto nucleate before h crosses 0. If h \/kT is increased at a rate\nslower than \u0006exp\u0001\u221220\u0002L2, then the surface spin-up phase\nwill have time to nucleate. As wetting then occurs, as h\ncrosses 0 there is then no further nucleation barrier to the\nformation of the bulk spin-up phase. In contrast, if h \/kT is\nincreased at a rate faster than \u0006exp\u0001\u221220\u0002L2, then the surface\nspin-up phase does not have time to nucleate before h\ncrosses 0. Then the surface spin-up phase will not have time\nto form, and there will be a barrier to nucleation of the bulk\nspin-up phase.\nIn this section we have considered nucleation of the\nspin-up surface and bulk phases. Of course, there is the re-\nverse problem of the nucleation of the spin-down phase at a\nsurface with a pre-existing wetting layer of up spins. If there\nis a thick wetting layer, the barrier for this may be very large;\nsee the review of Bonn and Ross20 for a discussion of this\nproblem. Thus the two nucleation problems, nucleation of\nthe spin-up and of the spin-down phases, may, at least under\nsome circumstances, be very different. We leave nucleation\nof the spin-down phase to future work.\nA. Comparison with classical nucleation theory\nThe classical nucleation theory prediction for the nucle-\nation rate of a surface transition can easily be obtained. Clas-\nsical nucleation theory assumes that the rate can be ex-\npressed as1,26\nrate = \n exp\u0001\u2212 \u0004F\u0001\/kT\u0002 , \u00012\u0002\nwhere \n is a kinetic prefactor that is assumed to vary only\nweakly with h, and \u0004F\u0001 is the free-energy barrier to nucle-\nation.\nIn two dimensions the free energy of a nucleating do-\nmain of a new phase looks like\n\u0004F\u0001R\u0002 = \u2212 \u000bR2t\u0001h \u2212 h\u0001s\u0002\u0002 + 2\u000bR\f . \u00013\u0002\nHere, the nucleus is assumed to be circular with radius R,\nand t layers thick on average. Then the first term in Eq. \u00013\u0002 is\nsimply the volume of the nucleus times the free energy per\nsite, assumed to be linear in h \u0001and 0 at h=h\u0001s\u0002\u2014which it\nmust be\u0002. The second term comes from the free-energy cost\nof the interface at the edge of the circular nucleus, which is\nequal to the length of this interface times the line tension \f.\nThe barrier \u0004F\u0001 is simply the maximum of \u0004F as a function\nof R, which is\n\u0004F\u0001 =\n\u000b\f2\nt\u0001h \u2212 h\u0001s\u0002\u0002\n. \u00014\u0002\nThus we see that the functional form of log of the rate is\n\u2212C \/ \u0001h\u2212h\u0001s\u0002\u0002, where C is a constant. We have fitted a func-\ntion of this form to our simulation data \u0001see Fig. 5\u0002. The\nquality of the fit is excellent. Note that for three-dimensional\nnucleation, the functional form is \u2212C \/ \u0001h\u2212h\u0001s\u0002\u00022 and that this\nprovides only a very poor fit to the data \u0001fit not shown\u0002. Thus\nwe conclude that from the perspective of classical nucleation\ntheory, nucleation of both phases looks like nucleation of a\nnew surface phase.\nB. Hard spheres at a hard wall\nThis work was inspired by work on fluids of hard\nspheres near their fluid-to-solid bulk transition, and in con-\ntact with a smooth hard wall. Hard spheres freeze via a\nstrongly first-order phase transition from a fluid with a re-\nduced density \r f =0.943 \u0001Ref. 27\u0002 to a crystal with a density\nabout 10% higher. This bulk behavior is well understood.\nHowever, the behavior of hard spheres near a hard wall has\nbeen harder to determine. In 1992 Courtemanche and\nco-workers7,8 concluded that the crystal phase of hard\nspheres wets a hard wall, i.e., as a fluid of hard spheres is\ncompressed up to a density \r f, a layer of the crystalline phase\nforms at the hard wall whose thickness diverges at \r f.\nDijkstra9 also found this. See also Dijkstra and van Roij.10\nMoreover, she found hysteresis suggesting that the first crys-\ntalline layer formed via a first-order prefreezing, surface\ntransition. These simulations were performed at and below\n\r f, where there is no bulk crystal phase.\nHeni and L\u00f6wen,28 then Laird and co-workers12\u201314 took\nan alternative route to determining whether or not the crystal\nphase wets the fluid\/wall interface. They determined all three\nrelevant interfacial tensions, here \u000ew111, \u000e111f, and \u000ewf. These\nare the interfacial tensions of the wall\/\u0001111\u0002-crystal-plane,\n\u0001111\u0002-crystal-plane\/fluid, and wall\/fluid interfaces, respec-\ntively. Then there is wetting if \u000ew111+\u000e111f\u0005\u000ewf. The early\ncalculations of these tensions12,13,28 found that the left- and\nright-hand sides of this inequality were so close to each other\nthat the results were not sufficiently accurate to answer the\nquestion one way or the other. However, the most recent\ncalculations by Laird and co-workers,13,14 and by Fortini and\nDijkstra,11 have more-or-less settled the issue: the crystal\nwets the wall-fluid interface. The surface tension of inter-\nfaces involving the crystal varies depending on the plane of\nthe crystal lattice that lies in the plane of the interface. Wet-\nting occurs with \u0001111\u0002 lattice planes in contact with both the\nwall and the fluid.\nThus, we conclude that the evidence is that there is both\nwetting by the crystalline phase of the wall\/fluid interface,\nand that there is a first-order surface transition at which a\nlayer of spheres at the wall freezes. This transition is called\neither prefreezing or precrystallization. However, Auer and\nFrenkel15 studied nucleation of the crystal phase at a hard\nwall and found a nucleation barrier at a pressure beyond the\ncoexistence pressure. A naive application of classical nucle-\nation theory would suggest that as the crystal phase wets the\nfluid\/wall interface, there should be no nucleation barrier.1,26\n164510-5 Nucleation of bulk and surface phases J.

Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jcp.aip.org\/jcp\/copyright.jsp\nHowever, we also have wetting in our Ising model and\nwe too have a nucleation barrier for the bulk phase. This\nsuggests that hard spheres near a hard wall and our Ising\nmodel may have qualitatively the same nucleation behavior.\nThis would imply that the nucleation barrier to crystalliza-\ntion may be nonzero and finite actually at fluid-crystal coex-\nistence. This would be in the absence of prenucleated surface\ncrystal layer. It also implies that the nucleation barrier will be\na smooth function of density as \r f is crossed.\nV. CONCLUSION\nWithin the precision with which can determine it nu-\nmerically, the nucleation rate of our Ising model varies\nsmoothly across the bulk phase transition. This is despite the\nfact that at the transition the phase that is nucleating changes.\nOur assumption is that this due to the fact that the critical\nnucleus is small, the nuclei in Fig. 1 are on average less than\ntwo layers thick. Therefore the nucleus has no means of\n\u201cknowing\u201d whether it will grow into a wetting layer that is\nmany times its own thickness but finite, or into an infinite\nbulk phase. If this understanding is correct, our finding will\nbe generic and apply generally to systems where nucleation\nof the bulk phase occurs at a surface that undergoes a first-\norder surface transition.\nIn the previous section we have discussed one system to\nwhich our findings may apply, namely, hard spheres at a hard\nwall. Another set of systems with analogous phase diagrams\nare liquids and liquid mixtures at walls. Experiments on liq-\nuid mixtures have found prewetting transitions; they found\nhysteresis that is similar to that seen in our Fig. 4. See, for\nexample, the study of Kellay et al.29 of methanol\/\ncyclohexane mixtures. Work on these systems is covered in\nthe review of Bonn and Ross.20 Liquid mixtures at surfaces\nmay be the best system to observe the effects seen here in\nexperiment. For example, the waiting time before a liquid\nlayer or bulk liquid appears could be determined across the\nbulk condensation transition.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nIt is a pleasure to thank A.
