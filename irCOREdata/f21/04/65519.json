The end of the premiership of Tony \nBlair saw the emergence of a significant public debate in the United Kingdom about the future \nappropriate trajectory for the relationship. This article assesses the state of the Special Relationship \nunder Prime Minister Gordon Brown, placing it in the context of the wider Atlantic alliance and of \nperennial concerns about shared values and structural imbalances between London and Washington.  \n \nKeywords: Atlantic alliance, Blair, Brown, Bush, special relationship \n \nIn April 2008, Prime Minister Gordon Brown gave a major foreign policy address at the John F. \nKennedy Presidential Library in Boston, Massachusetts. The speech was trailed as Brown\u2019s \u2018answer\u2019 \nto the speech made by Tony Blair to the Economic Club of Chicago in 1999 at the height of the \nKosovo crisis. In the 1999 address, inspired by a briefing paper from Lawrence Freedman, Blair made \nhis case for liberal interventionism; for American global leadership; and for a revived Special \nRelationship in the context of the global struggle for democracy and human rights (Blair 2004; \nFreedman 2007, 624). Brown\u2019s 2008 speech similarly posited global challenges, though with much \nmore of an economic emphasis. According to Brown, \u2018we are seeing in the scale, scope and speed of \nglobalisation the biggest restructuring of economic life since the industrial revolution\u2019. Brown called \nfor a rethinking of global institutions in order to \u2018build the truly global society\u2019. Though his main \nemphasis was economic \u2013 \u2018a new World Bank; a new International Monetary Fund\u2019 \u2013, Brown also \nadvocated a \u2018reformed and renewed United Nations\u2019, \u2018a new cultural effort\u2019 for democracy, \u2018a new \nkind of global peace and reconstruction corps\u2019 to rebuild failed states, as well as urgent multilateral \naction on climate change. In all this, \u2018American leadership is and will be indispensable\u2019 (Brown \n2008a). \nThis article will attempt to take the temperature of the contemporary Anglo-American Special \nRelationship. The discussion recognises the difficulty of wading into a swiftly flowing Anglo-American \nriver; imminent political and electoral shifts in both the UK and the US will inevitably affect the \nrelationship. Nevertheless, Brown\u2019s April 2008 address on US-UK relations provides a convenient \nhook upon which to hang this effort to assess the current state of the Special Relationship, and the \narticle will take the speech as its first frame of reference.  The discussion covers the transition from \nBlair, whose latter days in office were made difficult by his close association with a deeply unpopular \nAmerican president, to Brown, looking also at the recent attitudes of the Conservative Party \nleadership towards the United States. The article considers the current, post-Iraq invasion, condition \nof the Atlantic alliance and the role of the Special Relationship within that alliance. There follows an \nassessment of the perennial issues of values and balance in the US-UK relationship, concluding with \na brief look forward to the new American presidency. \nIn the foregoing discussion, I am assuming that there is such a thing as the US-UK \u2018Special \nRelationship\u2019. This, of course, is by no means self-evident. The Special Relationship, if indeed it does \nexist, is spoken of largely in British accents. Its most common invocations \u2013 shared values, shared \nhistory, shared language \u2013 arguably reflect sentiment and wishful-thinking as much as the real world \nof material interests. The relationship, though of course drawing on older association, was forged \nduring the Second World War. The geopolitical glue which held the relationship together from the \nlater 1940s began to fall away with the end of the Cold War. The Blair-Bush revival of close relations \nwas arguably as much the function of Blair\u2019s personal convictions \u2013 about the obligations of the UK-\nUS alliance, as well as about the proper international response to 9\/11 \u2013 as of any structural \ninclination of London to follow Washington. Despite all this, my contention is that the Special \nRelationship does exist. Its dimensions are primarily military and intelligence-related. Britain, since \nthe 1962 Nassau agreement, has had a unique nuclear relationship with the US: one that is, \naccording to taste, either privileged or dependent. British conventional defence relations to the US \nare also close; again, at least arguably, the US-UK military closeness constitutes a unique \nrelationship. In the arena of intelligence-sharing, the relationship again is close and unique, with \nformalised sharing between the two countries. There are very significant economic links. Despite the \nEuropeanisation of British trade, there is still very strong US-UK mutual financial investment. Lastly, \nthere is, for good or ill, a formalised expectation of cooperation and collaboration between the two \ncountries (Dumbrell 2004 ; Dumbrell 2006; Hodder-Williams 2000).   \nBearing these points in mind, let us proceed with our task of taking the temperature of the \nrelationship, starting with power transitions in London. \n \n \n \nBlair to Brown \nIn his JFK Library address, Gordon Brown repeatedly advertised his admiration for the political \nachievements of the Kennedy family. He cited John Kennedy\u2019s proposition on \u2018your independence \nday in 1962\u2019 of \u2018a new and global declaration of interdependence\u2019 \u2013 in effect, a plea for American \nmultilateral global engagement. Brown saluted Edward Kennedy as \u2018one of the greatest Senators in \nmore than two centuries\u2019. Surprisingly, Brown did not refer to Ted Kennedy\u2019s involvement with the \npolitics of Northern Ireland. (Such a reference might have been considered an inappropriate raking \nover of difficult ground; possibly even an inappropriate allusion to Tony Blair\u2019s greatest achievement \nin office, the delivering of peace in Northern Ireland). Brown also invoked the memory of Robert \nKennedy, and RFK\u2019s command to \u2018think anew\u2019, sending forth \u2018ripples of hope\u2019. These references to \nBobby Kennedy echoed Brown\u2019s essay on the hero of 1968, exalting his anti-war radicalism of that \nyear as moving courageously beyond the \u2018comfort zone of his party\u2019s establishment\u2019 (Brown 2008b, \n135). \nThe party of the Kennedys, of course, was the Democratic Party, and it is possible to interpret \nBrown\u2019s April 2008 speech as the first attempt to establish a dialogue with America\u2019s next Democrat \nin the White House. Brown\u2019s American connections and interests were widely noted at the time of \nhis move to 10 Downing Street. Most of his political connections are, indeed to Democrats. He was \nreported as favouring Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic primary race. As Chancellor of the \nExchequer, however, Brown maintained contact with more conservative American figures, notably \nAlan Greenspan. Brown has also taken an interest in the work of US neo-conservative social thinkers \n(Himmelfarb 2008 ; Lloyd 2007). The theme of connectedness, \u2018the means by which people can \ncommunicate, organise and change things\u2019 (Brown 2008c, 12), dominated the JFK Library speech. It \nalso manifested itself in Brown\u2019s concern for a new unifying symbolism of patriotic \u2018Britishness\u2019, \nrooted in admiration for the less grating practices and expressions of \u2018Americanism\u2019. \nThe interest in Brown\u2019s Ameriphilia in 2007-08 was stimulated primarily by the expectation that the \nnew British leader would seek to distance himself from the domestically damaging pro-Americanism \nof his predecessor. Brown, of course, did seek precisely to accomplish such a distancing in his early \ndealings with the Bush administration. During his August 2007 visit to the US, Brown (to quote \nJonathan Freedland) went \u2018about as far as a British Prime Minister could reasonably be expected to \ngo in putting an American president at arm\u2019s length\u2019 (Stelzer 2007). Following an awkwardly staged \nencounter with Bush in Golf Cart One, Brown described their exchanges as \u2018full and frank\u2019: common \ndiplospeak for murderously hostile. He described Afghanistan, rather than Iraq, as the \u2018front line \nagainst terrorism\u2019 (Bagehot 2007b). Mark Malloch Brown, the new minister for Asia and Africa, \nstated that it was very unlikely \u2018that the Brown-Bush relationship is going to go through the baptism \nof fire and therefore be joined together at the hip like the Blair-Bush relationship\u2019 (Malloch Brown \n2007). Appointees such as international development minister Douglas Alexander openly criticised \nWashington\u2019s unilateralism. Even Foreign Secretary David Miliband, in consistently describing the US \nas \u2018our single most important bilateral relationship\u2019, seemed almost wilfully to be avoiding the \nloaded term, \u2018special relationship\u2019 (Miliband 2007).  \nBeyond rhetoric and symbolism, real acrimony between London and Washington was observable not \nonly in relation to possible troop withdrawals from Iraq, but also concerning tactical disagreements \nin the Afghanistan campaign. London reportedly clashed with Washington over the extent of the \nlatter\u2019s support for the regime in Kabul, over the US poppy eradication programme (seen by the \nBritish as alienating Afghan \u2018hearts and minds\u2019), and over the US unwillingness to negotiate directly \nwith Iran (Maddox 2007). Redefinition of the Special Relationship after Blair did appear a possibility. \nJournalist Andrew Rawnsley called for a \u2018declaration of independence from America\u2019 (Rawnsley \n2007). Ian Kearns urged Brown to \u2018assert politically that it is possible to be serious minded on \nsecurity without agreeing with everything an American administration does\u2019 (Kearns 2007; see also \nGamble and Kearns 2007). Victor Bulmer-Thomas argued that \u2018there will no longer be unconditional \nsupport for US initiatives in foreign policy\u2019, whoever was in power in Washington. With the very \nimportant exception of intelligence-sharing, there was \u2018very little ... that a US government can do to \nreward the UK without rewarding other states\u2019 (Bulmer-Thomas 2006). \nThe early symbolic distancing from Washington was clearly linked to the domestic unpopularity of \nthe Blair-Bush partnership, and was also connected to the wide perception that the events of 2002-\n05 had involved a further radical unbalancing in an already imbalanced Special Relationship. Some \nAmerican voices reinforced this common British perception. Kendall Myers, senior analyst at the \nState Department\u2019s Bureau of Intelligence and Research declared in November 2006 that the US had \nacted with \u2018no sense of reciprocity\u2019 in relation to Blair\u2019s support in Iraq, converting the Prime \nMinister into a kind of \u2018Ramsay MacDonald\u2019 compromiser of Labour\u2019s ideals (Baldwin and Webster \n2006). Brown\u2019s early symbolic distancing was a reaction to, and indeed an expression of, the sense \nof hurt national pride evoked by remarks such as these. It did not last very long. Soon after assuming \nthe premiership, Brown announced measures to facilitate British integration into the US missile \ndefence system, as well as the construction of two aircraft carriers hosting US-made Chinook \nhelicopters and the Joint Strike Fighter. Trident nuclear renewal, probably along the same general \nlines as Kennedy and Harold Macmillan had agreed for Polaris at Nassau in 1962, was already settled \nby Labour\u2019s policy elite before Brown assumed office.  \nBrown\u2019s change in rhetorical tone involved no attempt to alter the defence and intelligence \nstructures of the Special Relationship. This is not to suggest that there was no shift at all. In a sense, \nBrown\u2019s JFK Library speech was a response to the post-Blair calls for a re-definition: to Rawnsley\u2019s \nappeal, for example, for Brown to recognise that \u2018the big issues of this century\u2019, including climate \nchange, \u2018cannot be addressed by a foreign policy obsessed only with hugging Washington\u2019 (Rawnsley \n2007). By the time of Brown\u2019s second, April 2008, official visit to the US, of course, even the \nsymbolism had changed. Memories of the Iraq invasion and its associated sense of national \nhumiliation had faded to some degree. The European political landscape also had shifted with the \nmore pro-American noises emanating from Paris and Berlin. A Times leader noted that the symbolic \ndistancing \u2018might have won temporary plaudits in the Labour Party\u2019, but it had made Brown \u2018a much \nmore marginal figure in Washington\u2019 (The Times 2007). In the event, Brown publicly acknowledged \u2018a \ngreat deal of gratitude\u2019 to Bush for his policies on terrorism, while enthusiastically using Special \nRelationship language, including invocation of the need to stand  \u2018shoulder to shoulder\u2019 with the US \n(Watt and MacAskill 2008).  \nDuring his April 2008 trip, Brown, even in the JFK Library address, had precious little to say about \nliberal interventionism. The emphasis was on the democratising power of new technologies, on \nmobilising \u2018the power of ideas, of shared values and of hopes that can win over hearts and minds\u2019, \nrather than military intervention. Given the international reaction to the invasion of Iraq, such an \nemphasis was inevitable. It should also be borne in mind that Blair\u2019s parallel speech, the 1999 \nChicago address, had been concerned to spell out the limits to liberal interventionism in the Balkans \ncontext (Freedman 2007, 624). Liberal interventionists were nevertheless alarmed, with Jonathan  \nPowell (Blair\u2019s former chief of staff) arguing that \u2018liberal interventionism will survive as the best way \nof defending our interests and the moral way to promote our values\u2019. For Powell, the real mistake \nover Iraq was the failure to make sufficiently explicit its humanitarian motives and purpose (Powell \n2007; see also Plant 2008).  \nThe desire to disassociate from the Blair legacy was not confined to the Labour Party. Blair had been \nable to rely on Conservative Party support for his Iraq policy. However, in September 2005, on the \nfourth anniversary of 9\/11, Conservative Party leader David Cameron criticised \u2018unrealistic\u2019 and \n\u2018simplistic\u2019 world views emanating from Washington. He contrasted his own \u2018liberal conservatism\u2019 \nwith the harsher beliefs of \u2018neoconservatives\u2019. Cameron\u2019s remarks earned him a rebuke from \nMargaret Thatcher (Coates 2006). In fact, both Cameron and shadow foreign secretary William \nHague seem to embrace a species of hybrid \u2018neo\u2019\/\u2019liberal\u2019 conservatism, defined in terms of a \nforeign policy philosophy which supports liberal, freedom-promoting interventionism with (to quote \nCameron) \u2018humility and patience\u2019 (Dodds and Elden 2008, 349, 357). During a House of Commons \ndebate on Iraq in early 2007, Hague declared that it was \u2018a lesson to us all for the future that \nembarking on military action alongside another power requires confidence ... that our allies have a \nsatisfactory plan\u2019 (Bagehot 2007a). The recent Conservative trajectory, in terms of relations with \nWashington, has actually been similar to that described by the new Brown government: coolness \ntowards Washington followed by a strong affirmation of \u2018special relations\u2019. In Cameron\u2019s case, this \ninvolved the easing of the strained relations with the White House which had existed ever since Tory \nleader Michael Howard called in 2004 for Blair\u2019s resignation over the failure to locate Iraqi weapons \nof mass destruction. Visiting Washington in November 2007, where he was given a meeting with \nBush that lasted (by various estimates) between 15 and 30 minutes, Cameron vowed that UK-US \nrelations under the Conservatives would \u2018remain special\u2019. Hague admitted that there had been \u2018a bit \nof a spat\u2019 between Bush and the pre-Cameron Tory leadership, but remarked that good relations had \nnow been restored (Baldwin 2007). Cameron\u2019s own stance towards the US echoed Brown\u2019s. In June \n2007, for example, he said that the UK should follow the US in teaching citizens \u2018what it means to be \nAmerican\u2019. During the presidential election campaign, he praised Barack Obama for raising the issue \nof personal moral responsibility in African-American communities (Baldwin 2007; Cameron 2007; \nRentoul 2008).  \n \nThe Atlantic Alliance                   \nBrown\u2019s Boston speech looked forward to \u2018a new dawn in collaborative action between America and \nEurope\u2019, a new commitment on the part of European leaders to \u2018work with America to forge \nstronger transatlantic links\u2019. The harm inflicted to Atlantic unity during the first Bush administration \nneeds little emphasis. As early as the February 2002 Munich Security conference, Undersecretary of \nDefence Paul Wolfowitz alarmed western European Atlanticists by conveying the administration\u2019s \nview that, in future engagements, the mission would determine the coalition. The extraordinary \ninvocation of Article 5 of the NATO Treaty in the form of an offer by Europe to help an endangered \nAmerica was effectively rebuffed by a US administration which (at least initially) seemed to care little \nfor international legitimacy (Pond 2005). \nAs the second largest military contributor to the engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan, Britain stood \nsomewhat apart from its European allies. According to 2007 estimates, the UK was the second \nbiggest military spender in NATO, with annual defence spending at $63.3 billion; the American figure \nwas $545.3 billion (Briefing 2008). Contemporary British defence policy is predicated on the \nassumption that large, high-intensity operations will involve the US-UK alliance (Edmunds and \nForster 2007, 41). The 2003 Defence White Paper reported a strategic environment where \u2018the most \ndemanding expeditionary operations, involving intervention against state adversaries, can only \nplausibly be conducted if US forces are engaged, either leading a coalition or in NATO\u2019 (Dorman \n2008,  22). British defence policy is rooted in a formal commitment to NATO and, indeed, to the \nEuropean Union, but increasingly appears to be oriented to the English-speaking ABCA (Australia, \nBritain, Canada, the US and New Zealand) community (Dorman 2008, 51). \n  A 2005 Congressional Research Service report on UK-US relations neatly summarised some of the \nparadoxes surrounding Britain\u2019s self-defined role as a bridge between Washington and continental \nEurope. The report noted that \u2018some UK foreign policy impulses are closer to those of its EU partners \nthan to those of the United States\u2019. According to the report, London shared the multilateralist, \nthreat-limitation (rather than threat-elimination) outlook of the EU civilian power. London\u2019s \nemphasis was \u2018on multilateral institutions as a way of managing international crises and legitimizing \nthe use of force\u2019; for the US, such an approach was \u2018only one option\u2019. The CRS report noted British \nresentment at the (perceived) US expectation that the UK should \u2018function automatically as the US \n\u201cwater carrier\u201d in the EU, that is, to fight for US policy positions on political and security issues such \nas EU defense structures or EU relations with China\u2019. The report itemised the military and \nintelligence links between the two countries, including the continued presence on British soil of \nabout 11,000 American military personnel and various joint military projects (Archik 2005). \nThe irony of Blair the arch-Europeanist becoming Bush\u2019s chief supporter in western Europe was not \nlost on the author of the 2005 CRS report. It suggested that Brown was likely to seek some ritual \ndistancing from Washington, not least because the (then) Chancellor of the Exchequer had deeper \nroots in the soil of Labour Party history than did Blair (Archik 2005, 11). A widely held impression of \nBrown\u2019s likely policy direction was (to quote Mark Leonard) \u2018that his brand of \u201cBritish \nexceptionalism\u201d could lead to a foreign policy that is both less Atlanticist and less pro-European\u2019 \nthan that followed by Blair (Leonard 2007). An International Affairs article in 2007 saw Brown as \nlikely to adopt an \u2018awkward partner\u2019 or \u2018pragmatic player\u2019 role (rather than a \u2018heart of Europe\u2019) role \nin the EU, retaining an \u2018instinctive Atlanticism\u2019 (O\u2019Donnell and Whitman 2007; see also see Niblett \n2007). The \u2018new\u2019 British foreign policy outlook was explained by David Miliband in July 2007 in terms \nof John Kennedy\u2019s notion of \u2018idealism without illusions\u2019, while Brown himself spoke of \u2018hard-headed \ninternationalism\u2019 (Miliband 2007). \nAs Gordon Brown\u2019s government sought to give some substance to these vague undertakings in 2007 \nand 2008, it became evident that shifts were occurring in Washington\u2019s position. The second Bush \nadministration\u2019s commitment to mending fences \u2013 seen in Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice\u2019s \nEuropean \u2018charm offensive\u2019 of early 2005 \u2013 turned out to be more than merely cosmetic. \nWashington was prepared to stand back as European powers negotiated with Iran. According to \nConstanze Stelzenmuller, the new American reorientation involved \u2018a number of things the world \nwas once emphatically told no US administration would ever do again\u2019 (Stelzenmuller 2008, 9).       \nEven in the first term, the administration came nowhere near the abandonment of multilateralism. \nTensions within NATO, of course, were very evident, not least in the conflict which emerged as the \ntest of the alliance: the engagement in Afghanistan. US Defence Secretary Robert Gates complained, \nas he looked to the 2008 NATO summit in Bucharest, that the organisation could become a two-tier \nalliance with \u2018some allies willing to fight and die to protect people\u2019s security, and others who are \nnot\u2019 (Briefing 2008). At the same time, however, The Economist reported that NATO officials were \nactually talking of a \u2018Copernican revolution\u2019 in Washington\u2019s attitude towards Europe, effectuated \nlargely by French President Nicolas Sarkozy\u2019s proposals for France to rejoin NATO\u2019s integrated \nmilitary structure. In early 2008, Victoria Nuland, US Ambassador to NATO, stated that Europe, the \nUS and the \u2018democratic world\u2019 needed \u2018a stronger, more capable European capacity. An ESDP \n(European Security and Defence Policy) with only soft power is not enough\u2019. Though Blair effectively \nlaunched the recent phase of ESDP at the St Malo summit of 1998, the UK soon began (effectively \nacting as America\u2019s self-promoted \u2018water carrier\u2019) to block ESDP initiatives, or at least conspicuously \nto avoid supporting them. By 2008, however, Britain was being urged by Washington to change \ndirection and support EU defence expansion. Victoria Nuland suggested that a new European \noperational headquarters be established to coordinate civil-military missions (like those described in \nBrown\u2019s JFK Library speech), operating \u2018as a NATO-EU family\u2019 (Briefing 2008). \nThe shift in Bush foreign policy, especially towards the end of the second term, was difficult to read. \nPolicy towards Iran, for example, seemed at times to encompass a new diplomatic dialogue, while \nstill keeping military options open. What seemed clear, however, was that the changed leadership \nstructures in France and Germany had created new transatlantic dynamics, with the Bush \nadministration offering a positive response. Against this background, Brown\u2019s Boston speech \nappeared an attempt to re-insert London in the centre of this dynamic. During the presidency of \nGeorge H. W. Bush, the prospect of a reunited Germany replacing the UK as Washington\u2019s main \nnational transatlantic interlocutor emerged, and was regarded by London as a threat to the US-UK \nSpecial Relationship and its putative pay-offs of favours and influence (Treverton 1990, 708; Coker \n1992). By 2008, the Brown government appeared to see something similar, with both Paris and \nBerlin competing to undermine London\u2019s proximity to Washington. Closeness to Washington, \ncertainly from the evidence of Brown\u2019s April 2008 US visit, was still something to be valued. As even \nthe late Hugo Young, a generally pro-European commentator put it, in late 2002 \u2013 at the height of \nIraq invasion fever \u2013 there \u2018may sometimes be national advantage in being the special ally of the \nmost powerful nation on earth\u2019 (Young 2002). \n \nValues and Balance in the Special Relationship \nBrown\u2019s invocation of special relations in the JFK Library speech contained its share of conventional \nSpecial Relationship pieties. The British PM declared himself \u2018pleased that over the past half century \nthe special relationship between America and Britain which John Kennedy prized remains strong and \nenduring \u2013 so firmly rooted in our common history, our shared values and in the hearts and minds of \nour people that no power on earth can drive us apart\u2019. When Bush visited London in June 2008, \nBrown referred to \u2018a partnership not just of governments but of peoples ... driven forward not \nsimply by interests, but by our shared values\u2019 (Bush and Brown 2008). \nSuch language is part of the lingua franca of international diplomacy and perhaps should not be \ntaken too seriously. However, the US and the UK do have close historical, linguistic and cultural ties. \nSentiment and shared history, despite demographic change in the US, do count for something, \nalthough it is all too easy to become carried away by froth and emotion. The US has a tradition of \nAnglophobia as well as Anglophilia (Moser 1999). Polling in Britain does not tend to reveal inordinate \ndegrees of anti-Americanism, though it does reveal considerable public antipathy to certain \nAmerican presidents. George W. Bush\u2019s personal unpopularity in western Europe, including Britain, \nneeds little emphasis. Even in May 2008, a YouGov poll for The Daily Telegraph recorded 35 per cent \nof respondents as identifying the US as a \u2018force for evil\u2019 in the world (Americans Abroad 2008). Anti-\nAmericanism among British Moslems, especially among young British Moslems, seems almost \nendemic (Gove 2006, 93-5). The Hillary Clinton-Barack Obama presidential primary race somewhat \nimproved America\u2019s international image. A large majority of British people \u2013 in a ratio of 5:1 \naccording to a poll reported in The Guardian newspaper (14 July 2008) \u2013 favoured Obama over John \nMcCain, and a Democratic victory in November was expected to spill over into more favourable \npublic opinion ratings for the US generally. Nevertheless, to risk stating the obvious: Brown\u2019s Boston \nrhetoric did not reflect the tenor of British public opinion during the Bush presidency. US \ncommentator Fareed Zakaria drew the following conclusion: \u2018while one might laud Tony Blair for his \nloyalty, one cannot expect democratic politicians to ignore the wishes of vast majorities of their \npeople\u2019 (Zakaria 2008, 249). \nAs for values more generally, Britain and America may be joined by a general commitment to the \nways of democratic capitalism. During the 1980s in particular, an Anglo-American, neo-liberal \ncapitalist model, associated with the increased marketisation of the political arena in both countries, \nemerged (see Krieger 1986). However, if we look at public \u2018values\u2019 in a wider sense, what is striking is \nthe very persistence in Britain of collectivist impulses in areas such as welfare and health provision, \ndespite the dominance of neo-liberal political discourse since the 1980s (Dumbrell 2006, 40-45). To \ntake data simply from polls published in 2008, almost twice as many Britons as Americans appear to \nbelieve that that their government should reduce taxes for the poor. Twice as many Americans as \nBritish \u2018strongly agree\u2019 that the \u2018profit motive is the best spur to job creation\u2019. Perhaps more \nsurprisingly, Britons are keener on free trade than are Americans. US public opinion is far more \npolarised than its British equivalent on issues such as homosexuality, action against Iran and \neconomic globalisation (Britain and America 2008). Whereas over 75 per cent of Britons agree with \nthe statement, \u2018humans as we know them developed from earlier species of animals\u2019, around 40 per \ncent of Americans disagree (Darwin\u2019s Doubters 2008). \nBrown\u2019s reference to \u2018partnership\u2019 with America again may be dismissed as the stuff of ephemeral \npress releases. The Special Relationship was born out of relative British international decline and \nAmerican international rise. The whole notion of \u2018Greeks and Romans\u2019 was developed as a way for \nBritish elites to cope with this shift in roles. Colonel Robert R. McCormick of the Chicago Tribune \nonce reportedly remarked in mid-20th century that the \u2018British are no longer important enough for \nme to dislike\u2019 (Galbraith 1981, 294). Though always based on asymmetry, the Special Relationship \nnevertheless, if it is to survive and to exhibit any kind of stability, must presumably incorporate \n\u2018balance\u2019 in the sense of the mutual recognition of limits, allied (at least at the level of elites) to \nsome degree of mutual trust. There were many instances in Special Relationship history of this \nbalance coming under severe pressure. Even in the key area of intelligence-sharing, there have been \ntimes when trust has broken down and the US has simply refused to share sensitive information. \nThis certainly occurred in the late 1970s and probably also in the run-up to the 2003 Iraq invasion \n(Urban 1996, 59-60; Sharp 2004, 67). There have been periods (as in the case of the 1983 Grenada \ninvasion) when London has been outraged by what it has seen as America\u2019s imperious insensitivity. \nOn occasion, Americans have expressed exasperation at the unrealistic posturing of the British: \nWilliam Odom, US National Security Agency Director between 1985 and 1989) remarked that \u2018the \nname of the British game is to show up with one card and expect to call the shots\u2019 (Urban 1996, 28). \nThe Special Relationship has been a very bumpy ride. However, at least arguably, some sense of \nbalance and sustained mutual trust has been preserved over the years.  \nThis balance-within-imbalance is still under threat. My intention here is not to re-open the debate \nabout American unilateralism, the Iraq invasion and the arrogance of Bush and the neo-\nconservatives. Blair was not in any sense \u2018forced\u2019 to send troops to fight in Iraq. He was actually \nsubjected to less intense pressure to support Washington militarily in 2003 than Harold Wilson was \nto send British forces to Vietnam in the mid-1960s. Rather than cajoling Blair into action, hard-liners \nin the Pentagon and in the Office of the Vice President tended rather to treat the British leader as a \nrather tiresome irrelevance. Many contemporary Special Relationship imbalances are connected to \nthe Global War on Terror. The extent of British complicity in the CIA\u2019s \u2018extraordinary rendition\u2019 \nprogramme for terrorist suspects remains unclear, but continues as a source of embarrassment for \nLondon. The Pentagon\u2019s response to \u2018friendly fire\u2019 incidents, such as that involving the death in Iraq \nof Lance Corporal Matty Hull, has been tardy and self-serving. The treatment of British citizens \nimprisoned at Guatanamo has been similarly unacceptable under the terms of any kind of Special \nRelationship mutuality. The imbalances I have in mind, however, do not relate entirely to the Bush \nanti-terrorist policies. They derive rather from a combination, on the one hand, of American global \nhegemonism, and, on the other, of the fragmented nature of the US governmental process. \nAn important dimension of this contemporary imbalance in US-UK relations relates to the concept of \n\u2018extraterritoriality\u2019 in American law. The extraterritoriality principle began to affect the UK in the \n1990s in connection with the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, signed into law by \nPresident Clinton on the day of the Florida Democratic presidential primary election in 1996.Co-\nsponsored by the Jesse Helms, Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, this \nlegislation, the Helms-Burton Act, wrote the US trade embargo on Cuba into US law and extended its \nreach to non-US companies engaged in Cuban trade. American citizens were also permitted under \nthe Act to sue non-US parties alleged to have profited from property confiscated by the Cuban \nregime. Over twenty leading British companies faced charges in US courts under the legislation; \nsome British businesspeople involved in Cuban trade were actually denied entry to the US (Black \n1996). In fact the extraterritorial elements of the Helms-Burton legislation were virtually negated by \nClinton\u2019s waiving of the relevant provisions, a practice which continued under President Bush (Haney \nand Vanderbrush 2005, 112-19). Extraterritoriality, however, was also a feature of the post-9\/11 \nPatriot Act. Designed to interrupt sources of funding for terrorism, the Act imposed US jurisdiction, \nand extensive reporting requirements, on non-US banks. Anti-terrorist port security laws imposed \nnew and expensive screening obligations on UK ports involved in trade with the US. British \nsubsidiaries of US companies have been penalised for dealing with countries which are subject to \nsupposedly unilateral US sanctions. The situation for British companies is even more complex in the \ncase of investment prohibitions imposed under individual US state law (Special Relationship \nCampaign 2008, 23-28). \nPerhaps the best known example of legislated US-UK imbalance relates to the extradition treaty, \nsigned by Home Secretary David Blunkett and US Attorney General John Ashcroft in March 2003. The \n\u2018Natwest 3\u2019 case in 2006 exposed some of the problems associated with the new extradition \nrequirements and indeed became something of a cause celebre in the politics of the Special \nRelationship. The National Westminster bankers were originally indicted (in 2002, before the new \ntreaty was signed) by a Texan court on \u2018wire fraud\u2019 charges associated with the Enron scandals in the \nUS, and were eventually extradited, despite the UK decision not to prosecute. The treaty became \neffective in Britain in January 2004, despite not being ratified by the US Senate until April 2007. \nThough often associated with post-9\/11 anti-terrorism, the treaty had been under negotiation since \nwell before the events of September 2001. Rather ironically, the delay in ratifying the treaty seems \nto have been connected to American anxieties about easing the way to extradition from the US of \nIrish republican terrorists. The treaty, and the 2004 UK legislation, appeared to contravene the \nprinciples of reciprocity and \u2018dual criminality\u2019, the requirement that the extraditionary offence \nshould involve a breach of the criminal law of both countries. In fact, the new extradition process \nclearly sets higher standards of evidence for extraditions from the US than from the UK. The US does \nnot have to provide prima facie evidence, while the UK has to bring forward \u2018such information as \nwould provide a reasonable basis to believe that the person sought committed the offence\u2019. \nRegarding \u2018dual criminality\u2019, some commercial practices which in the US are \u2018criminal\u2019, are treated in \nthe UK as regulatory offences (Connal and Sparrow 2006). \nComplaints about Special Relationship imbalance currently extend to areas such as US laws on \ninternet gambling, which have been used to close down non-US gaming operations. Congressionally \nimposed protectionism, including \u2018buy American\u2019 laws in the area of defence procurement, have \nlong been a source of UK-US conflict, and have been the subject of many European Union appeals to \nthe World Trade Organisation. British trade disputes with the US generally become subsumed into \ncontests between the US and the EU. An example here is the anti-dumping Byrd Amendment of \n2000, designed to give material incentives to US companies to sue non-US corporations for selling \nunfairly priced products in America (McCormick 2007, 99). The impermeability of US domestic air \ntravel to European carriers has been another source of transatlantic tension. Most controversially, \nthe announcement of new steel tariffs affecting British exports, just as the invasion of Iraq loomed, \nwas highly embarrassing, at least for Tony Blair. British Trade Secretary Patricia Hewitt memorably \ncondemned the tariffs as being \u2018in clear disregard of international opinion\u2019, a statement that was not \nwithout its ironies given the situation in Iraq (Curtis 2003, 155). Following a World Trade \nOrganisation ruling, the tariffs were set aside in December 2003. When Congressional protectionist \nsentiment has been allied with the anti-terrorist impulse, as in the 2007 Foreign Investment and \nNational Security Act, there are potentially serious compliance implications for British firms wishing \nto invest in the US (Special Relationship Campaign 2008, 28).  \nAs indicated above, the common sense of Special Relationship imbalance derives to some extent \nfrom the bifurcated nature of American federal government, and indeed to some extent from the \nnature of US federalism itself. The White House itself is frequently embarrassed by congressional \nactivity which seems to run counter to the thrust of executive branch-led foreign policy. British \ndiplomacy has often failed sufficiently to take account of the fragmented nature of the US foreign \npolicy process, not just in executive-legislative terms, but also in terms of intra-executive divisions \nand counter-currents. One of the Blair government\u2019s problems was its tendency to value contacts \nwith the State Department at the very time that it was being shut out of other important loops, \nnotably those involving Vice President Richard Cheney. Access to elements within Washington\u2019s \ncomplex and byzantine decisional structures is often confused with influence over final policy \n(Heuser 1996). Yet it is also the case that the White House is sometimes able to exploit the \nfissiparious nature of the American system for its own purposes, blaming Congress for behaviour \nthat it finds difficult to defend to its allies overseas. \nAn interesting case here is that of defence technology sharing. From London\u2019s perspective, not only \nthe US Congress but also the White House itself became excessively cautious after 9\/11 in sharing \ndefence technology, even with the country which was coming most obviously to America\u2019s aid in \nIraq. The US has been concerned with the possible re-export from the UK of military technology to \nChina (Archik 2005, 20). US-UK defence technology relations remain close; and indeed BAE Systems \nactually acquired the US defence firm, United Defense Industries, in 2005. However, complex \nquarrels emerged between British and American defence interests over the apparent US reluctance \nto grant waivers to Britain under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, resulting in the UK\u2019s \ninability to avoid complex and highly exclusionary licensing procedures. At one stage it seemed likely \nthat the UK would be denied access to the software codes needed to develop the Joint (US-UK)  \nStrike Fighter. A breakthrough of sorts occurred in June 2007, when Blair and Bush signed a new US-\nUK Defence Trade Cooperation Treaty. The new defence technology-sharing agreement was \narguably one of the few positive \u2018favours\u2019 achieved by Blair in return for his loyalty to all aspects of \nAmerica\u2019s  War on Terror. Yet the treaty failed to achieve quick Senate ratification, raising British \ncomplaints that the White House was simply not prepared to spend political capital on its behalf \n(Special Relationship Campaign 2008, 32). \n \nAfter Bush: keeping America engaged \nGordon Brown\u2019s JFK Library address was a strong appeal for continued American international \nengagement in the context of a revived two-way Atlanticism. His remarks were echoed in \npresidential candidate Barack Obama\u2019s speech in Berlin, delivered in July 2008: \u2018sometimes, on both \nsides of the Atlantic, we have drifted apart, and forgotten our shared destiny ... In this new century, \nAmericans and Europeans alike will be required to do more \u2013 not less\u2019. Obama\u2019s Berlin speech also \nreprised the key Brown theme of connectedness. According to the Senator from Illinois, \u2018the 21st \ncentury has revealed a world more intertwined than at any time\u2019 (Obama 2008). \nThe need for a re-energised Atlantic alliance was, in fact, a common theme during the 2008 \npresidential primary campaign, both on the Democratic and the Republican side. Talking up \nAtlanticism was a little easier for Democrats (Rubin 2008). Yet it was certainly not confined to their  \nside of the aisle, especially given the willingness (even eagerness) of Republicans to disengage from \nthe unpopular Bush legacy. During the first year since his 2007 appointment as chair of the Senate \nForeign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, Obama did not actually convene a single policy \nhearing. Statements on Europe from Republican candidate John McCain tended actually to be more \nspecific than those coming from Obama. In March 2008, for example, McCain published an op-ed \npiece in The Financial Times on the need for a revived Atlantic alliance. The article stressed common \nvalues and reinvigorated purpose \u2013 \u2018to build an enduring peace based on freedom\u2019. McCain \npromised to close the detention facility at Guantanamo and to support a \u2018cap-and \u2013trade\u2019 ant-\nclimate change agreement. He described a new Atlantic alliance emerging from \u2018a new global \ncompact\u2019, the League of Democracies. McCain also declared himself unequivocally in favour of \u2018the \nEU\u2019s efforts to build an effective European Security and Defence Policy\u2019 (McCain 2008).  \nIt is not difficult to anticipate some likely US-European tensions under the new president. An Obama \nvictory would stimulate huge excitement and glee in western Europe. Obama\u2019s July 2008 speech in \nBerlin\u2019s Tiergarten was a quite extraordinary political occasion. Yet his call in the speech for more \nEuropean commitment to Afghanistan was possibly a harbinger of problems to come. On the \ncampaign trail against Hillary Clinton, Obama also indulged in a degree of protectionist rhetoric \nwhich may return in a way that damages the Atlanticist revival. The main danger of an Obama \nelection, however, surely lies in excessively heightened European expectations. If a President Obama \ncan be expected simultaneously to delight and disappoint European (including British) opinion, a \nMcCain presidency would at least enjoy the advantage of lower expectations. The League of \nDemocracy idea would probably be seen in European capitals as an improvement on ad hoc \ncoalitions, but also as an unworkable underminer of the authority of the United Nations, and yet \nanother vehicle for unfettered American hegemonism. McCain\u2019s tough language on Russia, Cuba and  \nIran similarly go against the grain of elite western European opinion. The new American president \nwill present himself as a friend to European ESDP, but will face difficult decisions about how to deal \nwith the complex European realignments which may develop in the wake of the Lisbon Treaty. On \nthe wider question of American international engagement, neither Obama nor MCain has assumed \nthe mantle of even partial disengagement. However, any American leader coming to office in \nJanuary 2009 is bound to be preoccupied with America\u2019s own economic worries: the housing crisis \nand the fallout from the financial sector chaos of the Autumn of 2008. \u2018Iraq syndrome\u2019 inhibitions on \nfurther US military action may also be expected to apply, even in the case of a McCain victory. \nBrown\u2019s Boston address sought to align Britain with a major theme of the entire US presidential \nforeign policy debate: that of what has come to be called \u2018tough-love multilateralism\u2019 (Jentleson \n2007, 188). The future seems likely to witness a degree of American stepping down from the \noverreaching of the Bush first term; indeed, the Bush second term may be regarded as the first stage \nof this stepping down. International shifts \u2013 most obviously, though far from exclusively, the rise of \nChina \u2013 point to a \u2018post-polar\u2019 (Jentleson 2007, 183) or a \u2018post-American world\u2019 (Zakaria 2008). Such \nshifts do not spell the end of American global hegemony, but rather imply recognition of the logic of \nWalter Lippmann\u2019s famous warning that a leader \u2018must bring his ends and means into balance. If he \ndoes not, he will follow a course that leads to disaster\u2019 (Lippmann 1943, 5-6). As American leaders \nseek to close the \u2018Lippmann gap\u2019 between ends and means, a new multilateralist commitment \nbecomes inevitable, with Washington being likely to exact a price \u2013 typically UN reform \u2013 for such \nreinvigorated cooperativism. Brown\u2019s JFK Library invocation of the need \u2018to reframe the \ninternational architecture\u2019 served notice of Britain\u2019s possible role in the new agenda of \u2018tough-love \nmultilateralism\u2019. The question is: will Washington be listening to London? \nUnsurprisingly, the Special Relationship did not figure prominently in the US presidential election \ncampaign. McCain visited London in March 2008, committed himself to close relations with London, \nbut was also willing to make public his disagreements with elements of British policy (notably \nregarding poppy eradication) in Afghanistan (Beeston and Baldwin 2008). On the Democratic side, a \nminor storm blew up over Hillary Clinton\u2019s claims that she played an important role in the 1990s \nNorthern Irish peace process (Baldwin 2007). Obama\u2019s choice of Germany to make his key European \nspeech was interpreted in the British press as a sign that he saw Berlin, rather than London, as \nAmerica\u2019s natural European interlocutor (Reid 2008; Penketh 2008). London welcomed Obama\u2019s \nnew emphasis away from Iraq, and towards Afghanistan. Barack Obama\u2019s day-long visit to London in \nJuly saw him invoking America\u2019s \u2018abiding affection\u2019 for Britain, though (surely deliberately) avoiding \nthe phrase, \u2018special relationship\u2019 (Ferguson 2008). \nPerhaps the best advice that could be given to London is not to follow the line advocated in 1992 by \nCharles Powell: \u2018The special relationship with the United States will remain vital in the years ahead. \nWe shall need to work even harder to retain it\u2019 (Coker 1992, 407). The UK\u2019s relationship \u2013 military \n(especially nuclear), cultural and in the intelligence field \u2013 is different, indeed in important respects \ncloser, than that of other European countries. The UK has also especially intimate middle-level \nmilitary and diplomatic intertwining with the US: what President Kennedy in 1962 called the \u2018coral \nreef\u2019 dimension of the Atlantic alliance (Ryan 2003, 153). However, constant worry about London\u2019s \nspecial closeness to Washington being eroded by Berlin \u2013 or even, rather amazingly, by Paris \u2013 \nsimply damages the clarity of pursuit of Britain\u2019s legitimate interests. Historically, British diplomacy \nhas tended to value the Special Relationship too much in terms of the opportunities it has been seen \nto offer for enhancing the UK\u2019s symbolic global profile. Privileged access to the ear of the hegemonic \npower did little for UK interests at the time of the Iraq invasion. A more hard-headed commitment \nto rebalancing the relationship would serve Britain well in the post-Bush era. \n \n Bibliography \nAmericans Abroad (2008) \u2018Not for Much Longer\u2019, The Economist, 28 June. \nArchik, K.
