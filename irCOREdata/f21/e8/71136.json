High-power high-frequency radio waves beamed\ninto the ionosphere cause plasma turbulence, which can ac-\ncelerate electrons. These electrons collide with the F-layer\nneutral oxygen causing artificial optical emissions identi-\ncal to natural aurora. Pumping at electron gyro-harmonic\nfrequencies has special significance as many phenomena\nchange their character. In particular, artificial optical emis-\nsions become strongly reduced for the third and higher gyro-\nharmonics. The High frequency Active Auroral Research\nProgram (HAARP) facility is unique in that it can select a\nfrequency near the second gyro-harmonic. On 25 Febru-\nary 2004, HAARP was operated near the third and passed\nthrough the second gyro-harmonic for the first time in a\nweakening ionosphere. Two novel observations are: firstly,\na strong enhancement of the artificial optical emission in-\ntensity near the second gyro-harmonic, which is opposite\nto higher gyro-harmonics; secondly, the optical enhance-\nment maximum occurs for frequencies just above the sec-\nond gyro-harmonic. We provide the first experimental evi-\ndence for these effects, which have been predicted theoret-\nically. In addition, irregular optical structures were created\nwhen the pump frequency was above the ionospheric critical\nfrequency.\nKeywords.

Kosch\n(m.kosch@lancaster.ac.uk)\n1 Introduction\nA major goal for active experiments in the ionosphere is\nto understand the fundamental physics governing the inter-\naction between plasma and electromagnetic waves. High\npower high frequency pumping of the ionosphere causes\nseveral well-known phenomena. These include magnetic\nfield-aligned density irregularities (Robinson et al., 1989;\nFrolov et al., 1997) of small scale size (1\u201310 m) (Kelley et\nal., 1995) called striations, stimulated electromagnetic emis-\nsions (Leyser, 2001), anomalous (non-collisional) absorption\nof low power diagnostic radio waves when they propagate\nthrough the pumped volume (Stubbe, 1996), electron tem-\nperature enhancements (Stocker et al., 1992; Rietveld et al.\n2003) and artificial optical emissions, which are produced by\nelectron collisions with the neutrals. This last phenomenon is\nnow well-established at auroral latitudes at EISCAT in north-\nern Scandinavia (Bra\u00a8ndstro\u00a8m et al., 1999) and at HAARP\nin Alaska (Pedersen and Carlson, 2001). Observing these\nphotons is the best means of remotely detecting the ener-\ngetic electrons, which result from turbulent plasma processes\nbrought on by the pump wave. The energisation threshold\nfor the O(1D) 630 nm and O(1S) 557.7 nm emissions are 1.96\nand 4.17 eV, respectively, although the effective threshold for\nO(1D) is\u223c3.5 eV due to collisional quenching by N2 (Haslett\nand Megill, 1974).\nThe mechanism for electron acceleration is thought to be\nelectrostatic waves. The two main candidate mechanisms\nare upper-hybrid waves and Langmuir waves, which act per-\npendicular and parallel to the magnetic field line, respec-\ntively. For high latitudes, Leyser et al. (2000) suggested\n1586 M. Kosch et al.: Artificial optical emissions at HAARP\nthat upper-hybrid turbulence is the dominant mechanism, for\nwhich theoretical support (Istomin and Leyser, 2003) and\nexperimental evidence (Kosch et al., 2002a) exists. Upper-\nhybrid waves are generated by resonant mode conversion\nof the pump electromagnetic wave on plasma irregularities\n(Robinson, 1989), i.e. striations. This occurs efficiently at\nthe upper-hybrid resonance altitude, which is typically 3\u2013\n8 km below the high frequency reflection altitude in the iono-\nsphere. Upper-hybrid waves have a symbiotic relationship\nwith pump-enhanced striations (Dysthe et al., 1982), which\nare a common feature of ionospheric pumping (e.g. Robinson\net al., 1998; Bond et al., 1997) and are associated with artifi-\ncial optical emissions (Kosch et al., 2002a,b). The growth of\nstriations is due to thermal parametric instabilities, which are\nstimulated by the pump wave (Fejer, 1979; Robinson, 1989;\nMj\u00f8lhus, 1990). Coherent radar backscatter is produced by\nBragg scattering of the sounding waves from either natural\nor pump-enhanced striations (Stubbe, 1996). Hence, pump-\ninduced coherent backscatter acts as a proxy for detecting ar-\ntificial upper-hybrid waves and is routinely observed by the\nSuperDARN radars (e.g. CUTLASS for EISCAT and Kodiak\nfor HAARP). However, backscatter is only observed when\nthe radar ray is essentially orthogonal to the striations at the\npoint of reflection (Fialer, 1974; Minkoff et al., 1974), hence\npropagation conditions between the radar and the striations\nare critical to successful observations (Senior et al., 2004).\nPump wave conversion to Langmuir electrostatic waves is\naccompanied by the simultaneous production of ion-acoustic\nwaves (Robinson, 1989, 1997) to which incoherent backscat-\nter radars (e.g. EISCAT) are sensitive. Observations of en-\nhanced ion-line (ion-acoustic waves) and plasma-line (Lang-\nmuir waves) backscatter just below the pump wave reflection\naltitude show that Langmuir turbulence is important for the\ninitial few seconds after a pump wave is switched on (e.g.\nHonary et al., 1999) before the pump-enhanced striations\nfully establish themselves. In addition, Honary et al. (1999)\nhave shown that Langmuir turbulence persists when pumping\non an electron gyro-harmonic frequency because the growth\nof striations is suppressed (e.g. Ponomarenko et al., 1999;\nKosch et al., 2002a). Hence, the high frequency pump wave\ncan reach the higher Langmuir matching height without be-\ning dissipated at a lower altitude by mode conversion into\nupper-hybrid waves (Gurevich 1978; Dysthe et al., 1982).\nArtificial optical emissions associated with Langmuir tur-\nbulence on the fourth gyro-harmonic have been observed\n(Kosch et al., 2004).\nMost ionospheric modification effects are sensitive to the\npump frequency relative to the electron gyro-harmonic fre-\nquency. Stimulated electromagnetic emissions change their\ncharacter (Stubbe et al., 1994; Honary et al., 1995; Frolov\net al., 2001), anomalous absorption minimizes (Stocker et\nal., 1993; Stubbe et al., 1994), electron temperature en-\nhancements minimize (Honary et al., 1995; Robinson et al.,\n1996) and artificial optical emissions minimize (Kosch et\nal., 2002a; Gustavsson et al., 2004) (with the notable ex-\nception mentioned earlier (Kosch et al., 2004)). All these\nphenomena are linked to striations, and by association upper-\nhybrid waves, whose growth are suppressed when pumping\non a gyro-harmonic frequency (Honary et al., 1995; Robin-\nson et al., 1996). In addition, Istomin and Leyser (2003)\npredicted theoretically that upper-hybrid waves and stria-\ntions, and therefore also artificial optical emissions, would\nbe stronger for pump frequencies just above a gyro-harmonic\nfrequency compared to below it, i.e. an asymmetry would ex-\nist. A significant caveat with all of the above gyro-harmonic\nresults is that they are only for pumping frequencies well\nabove the second gyro-harmonic.\nUntil recently, opportunities to perform ionospheric pump\nexperiments on the second gyro-harmonic have been very\nlimited. In the early 1980s, the EISCAT pump facility could\noperate around the second gyro-harmonic (2.76 MHz) (e.g.\nFrey, 1986), but no optical or electron temperature data have\nbeen published. In the 1970s, experiments using the mid-\nlatitude Platteville heater in Colorado, USA, were performed\nat the fixed pump frequency of 2.85 MHz. They produced co-\nherent radar backscatter (Fialer, 1974; Minkoff et al., 1974),\ni.e. striations and upper-hybrid waves, and artificial optical\nemissions (<100 Rayleigh at 630 nm) (Sipler and Biondi,\n1972; Haslett and Megill, 1974). When the pump frequency\nhappened to be close to the second gyro-harmonic, excep-\ntionally bright artificial optical emissions were produced\n(>250 Rayleigh at 630 nm) (Haslett and Megill, 1974). One\nof us (Sentman, D., 2002 campaign) has observed bright ar-\ntificial optical emissions from the HIPAS facility in Alaska,\nwhich also operates at 2.85 MHz. Fialer (1974) also noted\nthat coherent backscatter was enhanced when pumping close\nto the second gyro-harmonic. Theory predicts that the thresh-\nold for the thermal parametric instability, which is a mech-\nanism for the growth of striations (Fejer, 1979; Robinson,\n1989; Mj\u00f8lhus, 1990), is reduced close to the second gyro-\nharmonic (Grach, 1979) by as much as a factor of 5-10 (Das\nand Fejer, 1979). This is only true for an inhomogeneous\nplasma where the plasma density and magnetic field gradi-\nents are anti-parallel (Grach, 1979), which is exactly the situ-\nation in the ionosphere below the F-region peak. Das and Fe-\njer (1979) suggest that the reduction in threshold would also\nresult in enhanced striations, which is consistent with the ob-\nservations (Fialer, 1974; Haslett and Megill, 1974). In addi-\ntion, Fialer (1974) noted that coherent backscatter power, i.e.\nstriations, maximized when pumping just above the second\ngyro-harmonic, which is consistent with a modern theory of\ncylindrical upper-hybrid waves trapped in striations (Istomin\nand Leyser, 2003), although this theory does not explicitly\ndeal with the second gyro-harmonic. Optical evidence of this\neffect is presented in this paper for the first time.\n2 Results and analysis\nThe High frequency Active Auroral Research Program\n(HAARP) facility at Gakona (62.4\u25e6 N, 145.15\u25e6 W), Alaska,\ncan operate from 2\u201310 MHz and therefore covers all gyro-\nharmonics from 2 to 7. HAARP is currently the only\nionospheric heater capable of selecting a pump frequency\nM. Kosch et al.: Artificial optical emissions at HAARP 1587\nsuitable for passing through the second gyro-harmonic of al-\nmost any nighttime ionosphere. On 25 February 2004 an ex-\nperiment was performed, which attempted to pass through\nthe third and second gyro-harmonic frequencies for Kodiak\nradar (SuperDARN) plasma-line (fradar+fheater) observa-\ntions (Hughes et al., 2003). Simultaneously, optical mea-\nsurements were made by different filtered camera systems,\nranging from all-sky to telescopic, and a photometer. Here\nwe report only on the all-sky camera and photometer optical\nobservations for 630 and 557.7 nm, and the Kodiak centre-\nline (fradar) observations.\nThe electron gyro-harmonic frequency is given\nbyfgyro= Be2pim , where e and m are the charge and mass\nof an electron, respectively, and B is the ionospheric\nmagnetic field strength, which varies with altitude. B was\ndetermined from the IGRF-2000 model. In a steady state\nionosphere the gyro-harmonic may be found by frequency\nstepping the pump wave (Kosch et al., 2002a). However,\nin a weakening ionosphere, which is typical soon after\nsunset, passing through the gyro-harmonic is more likely\nto be successful if a constant pump frequency just below\nthe gyro-harmonic is chosen. As the ionosphere weakens,\nthe critical frequency drops but generally the pump wave\nreflection altitude also increases. This automatically reduces\nthe gyro-harmonic frequency due to the magnetic field\nstrength weakening with increasing altitude. In a correctly\ndesigned experiment, the pump frequency becomes greater\nthan the gyro-harmonic before it exceeds the ionospheric\ncritical frequency. In this way, a single frequency sweep\nthrough the gyro-harmonic is possible for a non-steady state\nionosphere. The upper-hybrid resonance altitude occurs\nwhere pump frequency (fpump) equals the upper-hybrid\nfrequency (fuhr). By definition, fuhr corresponds to the\naltitude where the plasma frequency (fplasma) satisfies\nf 2plasma=f 2uhr\u2212f 2gyro or f 2plasma=f 2pump\u2212f 2gyro. Since\nfpump and fgyro are known, the altitude of fplasma can be\ndetermined from the electron density profile in the iono-\nsphere, for which the co-located Digisonde data was used.\nThe upper-hybrid resonance altitude is typically 3\u20138 km\nbelow the pump wave reflection altitude (Kosch, 2002a).\nThe Digisonde produces time of flight data for echoes over a\nwide range of frequencies (e.g. typically 1\u201310 MHz), which\nmay be converted into an equivalent electron density altitude\nprofile by compensating for the variable propagation speed\nas a function of density. These data were analysed using\nboth the ARTIST and POLAN algorithms, which produced\nconsistent results.\nFrom 04:02:30 to 04:45:00 UT HAARP was operated\nat 4.25 MHz in O-mode, corresponding to the third gyro-\nharmonic at 233.5 km. A 150 s on, 150 s off cycle was used\nto prevent interference with the Digisonde whose data are\nessential to the analysis. The beam was pointed into the lo-\ncal magnetic zenith (204\u25e6 azimuth, 75 \u25e6 elevation), where\nthe maximum optical effect is expected (Kosch et al., 2000;\nGurevich et al., 2002; Pedersen et al., 2003; Rietveld et al.,\n2003). The effective radiated power (ERP) was 47.8 MW\nwith a \u22123 dB beam size of 20.8\u00d729.1\u25e6 (geomagnetic N-\nFig. 1. Results from 25 February 2004.

From 04:47:30 to 07:00 UT the pump frequency\nwas set to 2.84 MHz, corresponding to the second gyro-\nharmonic at 228.5 km, with the same pump cycle and beam\npointing direction. The ERP was 10.9 MW with a \u22123 dB\nbeam size of 31.9\u00d744.6\u25e6. For the entire experiment, the pho-\ntometer was pointed parallel to the HAARP beam and has an\n8\u00d714\u25e6 field of view covering the central part of the pump\nbeam.\nFigure 1 shows the results obtained. The vertical dashed\nline in all panels separates the third (left) and second (right)\ngyro-harmonic parts of the experiment. Panel A shows the\npump frequency used (solid lines), ionospheric critical fre-\nquency (\u00d7) and pump cycle (square waves). As expected af-\nter sunset, the ionospheric critical frequency descended with\ntime, dropping below the pump frequency during each phase\n1588 M. Kosch et al.: Artificial optical emissions at HAARP\nof the experiment. Panel B shows the altitude of the respec-\ntive gyro-harmonics (dotted lines), the pump wave reflec-\ntion altitude measured by the Digisonde (+), and the upper-\nhybrid resonance altitude (\u00d7). Unfortunately, the third gyro-\nharmonic was never found, this being due the uncertainty as-\nsociated with the real time Digisonde analysis. However, the\nupper-hybrid resonance altitude did pass through the second\ngyro-harmonic. The data shown in panel B have been man-\nually analysed and have an altitude uncertainty of \u00b110 km.\nIn addition, the Digisonde echoes come predominantly from\noverhead whereas the HAARP beam is pointed into the mag-\nnetic zenith for which refraction lowers the effective reflec-\ntion altitude. Ray tracing of the pump wave (not shown)\nshows that the lowering of the reflection altitude is <10 km,\nwhich is within the measurement uncertainty, and the upper-\nhybrid resonance altitude is still reached everywhere within\nthe pump beam. Hence, no correction has been undertaken\nfor this effect. Issues surrounding the reflection altitude un-\ncertainty are discussed later in detail. After 04:20 UT for the\nfirst part of the experiment and 05:40 UT for the second part,\nthe interesting situation arises that the pump wave does not\nalways reflect (+) but still finds the upper-hybrid resonance\naltitude (\u00d7). This situation occurs when the pump frequency\nis just above the ionospheric critical frequency as shown in\npanel A.\nPanel C of Fig. 1 shows the background-subtracted pho-\ntometer optical data calibrated in Rayleighs. The enhance-\nments above background for 630 (red line) and 557.7 (green\nline) nm, synchronised with the pump on cycles, are ob-\nvious. For the first part of the experiment (third gyro-\nharmonic) optical emissions continue for the pump-on pe-\nriods at 04:22:30 and 04:27:30 UT where upper-hybrid res-\nonance is still possible but the Digisonde predicts no reflec-\ntion can take place. The loss of reflection whilst still find-\ning the upper-hybrid resonance altitude provides additional\nevidence that upper-hybrid turbulence is the primary mecha-\nnism of electron acceleration (Kosch et al., 2002a). Lang-\nmuir turbulence is a competing mechanism (Kosch et al.,\n2004), which occurs only close to the reflection altitude, and\nis not possible in this case. For the next two pump-on cy-\ncles (04:32:30 and 04:37:30 UT) optical enhancements are\nstill clearly seen although the Digisonde predicts that no in-\nteraction can take place. This discrepancy may be due to the\ndifferent beam sizes and pointing directions of the HAARP\nand Digisonde facilities. Optical emissions are produced for\nthe pump frequency up to 400 kHz above the ionospheric\ncritical frequency (04:37:30 UT). For the pump-on cycle at\n04:42:30 UT, no optical emission is produced and the pump\nfrequency is 450 kHz above the critical frequency. This is\nconsistent with observations by Pedersen et al. (2003) who\nfound that photon production cut off sharply for pump fre-\nquencies >500 kHz above the critical frequency. In this sit-\nuation the pump wave does not reflect, providing evidence\nthat upper-hybrid waves are important for accelerating the\nelectrons (Mishin et al., 2004, 2005).\nFor the second part of the experiment (second gyro-\nharmonic), optical enhancements (Fig. 1c) up to 300\nRayleighs for 630 nm and 60 Rayleighs for 557.7 nm oc-\ncur for the pump cycles between 05:12:30 and 05:32:30 UT.\nBoth emissions are exceptionally bright considering the\nmodest ERP of 10.9 MW but are consistent with previous\nobservations close to the second gyro-harmonic (Haslett and\nMegill, 1974). For comparison, a similar red line bright-\nness was achieved at EISCAT using an ERP of 550 MW\nat 5.423 MHz (Kosch et al., 2004). The brightest opti-\ncal enhancements occur immediately after the pump fre-\nquency passed through the second gyro-harmonic at the\nupper-hybrid resonance altitude (05:12:30 to 05:32:30 UT).\nThis corresponds to the pump frequency being above the sec-\nond gyro-harmonic by \u223c7 kHz for 05:20 to 05:25 UT. Noth-\ning obviously different happens to the optical signals right\non the second gyro-harmonic compared to below it. The en-\nhanced optical emissions near the second gyro-harmonic is\nopposite to that observed at the third (Kosch et al., 2002a)\nand fourth (Gustavsson, B., private communication) gyro-\nharmonics where the optical emissions were almost extin-\nguished. The optical enhancement asymmetry about the\ngyro-harmonic is consistent with the theory of cylindrical\nupper-hybrid waves trapped in striations (Istomin and Leyser,\n2003). After 05:40 UT, optical enhancements continue even\nthough the pump wave penetrates the ionosphere, as dis-\ncussed before. At 05:55 UT there is another significant en-\nhancement in optical emission brightness at 630 nm, which\nis clearly not gyro-harmonic related. Unfortunately, the pho-\ntometer recording terminated at 06:00 UT due to a program-\nming error but the camera data show that these bright en-\nhancements continue until 06:15 UT. We associate this phe-\nnomenon with the pump frequency being just above the iono-\nspheric critical frequency. The enhanced optical emission\nmay be due to upper-hybrid resonance occurring over an ex-\ntended height range giving a brighter column emission. The\nextended height range is due to the very low gradient in\nplasma density, which occurs near the F-region peak. This\neffect has been reported from the mid-latitude SURA iono-\nspheric pump facility (Bernhardt et al., 2000). The height\nrange would normally increase as the ionospheric critical fre-\nquency drops quite independently of any chosen pump fre-\nquency, which is supported by the ionograms (not shown).\nThis may explain why a similar enhancement was not seen\nat the end of the first part of the experiment (performed\nat 4.25 MHz) as opposed to the second part (performed at\n2.84 MHz).\nFigure 2 shows example images of the calibrated artificial\noptical emissions at 630 nm from the all-sky imager with the\nHAARP beam overlaid. The top two panels show images\nfrom pumping close to the second gyro-harmonic (05:20 and\n05:25 UT). An optical blob is seen centred within the pump\nbeam and on the local magnetic zenith. The optical blob\nis significantly smaller than the pump beam size, consistent\nwith previous observations (Kosch et al., 2000; Pedersen et\nal., 2003; Rietveld et al; 2003). The bottom two panels show\nimages (05:50 and 05:55 UT) from pumping just above the\nionospheric critical frequency (\u223c4\u20139 kHz). In these exam-\nples irregular optical structures are seen. This is probably due\nM. Kosch et al.: Artificial optical emissions at HAARP 1589\nto the pump beam illuminating large-scale plasma density\nirregularities. Enhanced density patches would correspond to\nregions of optical emissions with the dark areas correspond-\ning to no interaction with the propagating pump wave. It is\nthese patchy structures that correspond to the significantly\nenhanced 630 nm optical emissions at the end of the pho-\ntometer data (see Fig. 1c). A similar effect has been observed\nin the E-layer at low latitudes (Kagan et al., 2000).\nPanel D of Fig. 1 shows the ratio of I(557.7)\/I(630). This\nratio forms a simple indicator of the relative electron energy\nwith the caveat that pump-induced turbulent plasma is un-\nlikely to have a Maxwellian distribution (Gustavsson et al.,\n2002). Since the 630 nm emission has a growth\/decay e-\nfolding time of \u223c30 s in the lower F-region (Gustavsson et\nal., 2001), the ratio is performed only for the last 90 s of\neach pump on period. The apparent amplitude reduction\nwith time is due to the fact that collisional quenching of\nthe 630 nm emission decreases as the altitude increases (see\nFig. 1b) giving a brighter 630 nm optical emission relative to\n557.7 nm. Ignoring the pump pulse just before the change\nin pump frequency, the ratio falls in the range \u223c0.05\u20130.4,\nstrongly suggesting that a non-Maxwellian electron energy\ndistribution must exist within the heated plasma (Gustavs-\nson et al., 2002). The ratio remains fairly constant (\u223c0.15\u2013\n0.2) for the period 05:12:30 to 05:32:30 UT when the opti-\ncal emissions were significantly enhanced for pumping just\nabove the second gyro-harmonic. This indicates that the\nelectron acceleration mechanism probably did not change\nsignificantly. The increased accelerated electron flux, as\nwitnessed by the brighter optical emissions, indicates that\nthe acceleration mechanism is more efficient when pump-\ning just above the second gyro-harmonic. This suggests that\nthe striations are enhanced when pumping near the second\ngyro-harmonic, consistent with Fialer\u2019s (1974) observations,\nwhich is consistent with the theories by Das and Fejer (1979)\nand Grach (1979).\nPanel E of Fig. 1 shows the Kodiak radar backscatter\npower over HAARP at 10 MHz, which is clearly modulated\nby the pump cycle. For the first part of the experiment (third\ngyro-harmonic) all pump cycles produce backscatter, except\nfor the last one. For the pump cycle at 04:42:30 UT vir-\ntually no detectable Kodiak backscatter is produced, which\ncorresponds exactly with the lack of optical data (Fig. 1c).\nAgain, this is entirely consistent with upper-hybrid waves\nbeing the primary mechanism for producing pump-induced\nartificial optical emissions (Kosch et al., 2002a,b).\nAfter 05:00 UT, during the second part of the experiment\n(second gyro-harmonic) the backscatter power decreases to\nthe noise level and remains there (Fig. 1e). This occurred\njust before the pump wave passed through the second gyro-\nharmonic and is unexpected. Loss of backscatter is ambigu-\nous in that it can either be due to a lack of scatterers (i.e. no\nstriations) or unfavourable propagation conditions resulting\nin the backscattered wave not reaching the radar receiver. To\nguarantee radar backscatter, the ray must be very close to or-\nthogonal to the scatterer (<3\u25e6) (Fialer, 1974; Senior et al.,\n2004). Figure 3 shows the intervals of the ray paths which\nFig. 2. Example images of the calibrated artificial optical emissions\nat 630 nm from the HAARP all-sky imager. The large circle is the\nhorizon.

All ray paths for Kodiak\nlaunch angles from 6 to 30\u25e6 in steps of 1\u25e6, corresponding\nto the radar beam pattern, were tested. The ray tracing was\nperformed using the Digisonde data and IGRF-2000 model.\nHAARP\u2019s position is denoted by the vertical line. Black,\nred, green and blue correspond to 04:20, 04:55, 05:10 and\n05:25 UT, respectively. The HAARP beam was dipped 15\u25e6\noff-vertical and has a half-angle of \u223c16\u25e6 in this direction, so\nthe vertical line closely corresponds to the poleward edge of\nthe beam. At 04:20 (black) and 04:55 (red) UT backscatter is\nclearly possible over HAARP and does occur (see Fig. 1e).\nAt 05:10 UT conditions for orthogonality become marginal\nover HAARP and this corresponds to the rapid decline in\nKodiak backscatter power. At 05:25 UT, Kodiak backscat-\nter is essentially impossible, corresponding to the noise data\nin Fig. 1e. Hence, the loss of Kodiak backscatter data after\n05:10 UT is easily understood. The loss of suitable prop-\nagation conditions for backscatter means that we have no\ninformation regarding the strength of the striations, and by\nassociation the upper-hybrid waves, around the second gyro-\nharmonic. In all likelihood, striations were being produced\nby HAARP around the second gyro-harmonic (Fialer (1974),\nMinkoff et al. (1974)). Not only did Fialer (1974) observe\n1590 M.

The loss of Kodiak data during\nour experiment resulted from a temporary technical limita-\ntion in that there was no real time data display when operat-\ning the Kodiak radar in the plasma-line mode. This explains\nwhy no corrective action (i.e. moving to a lower radar fre-\nquency) was taken. Plasma-line data were obtained but are\nnot analysed here.\nA \u00b110 km change in the pump wave reflection altitude\n(Fig. 1b), corresponding to the uncertainty in analysing the\nDigisonde data, results in a similar uncertainty in the upper-\nhybrid resonance altitude. A 10 km change in either direction\nhas important consequences for the interpretation of the re-\nsults. However, we are confident that our analysis is correct\nfor the following reasons. If the altitude of the data points\nin Fig. 1b were lowered by 10 km, then the optical enhance-\nment at the second gyro-harmonic would have no asymmetry.\nIn this case, the upper-hybrid resonance altitude would also\nhave passed through the third gyro-harmonic. This would\nhave resulted in a significant reduction in Kodiak backscat-\nter power and optical intensity (Kosch et al., 2002a) prior\nto 04:10 UT. These effects were not observed (see Figs. 1c\nand 1e). If the altitude of the data points in Fig. 1b were\nraised by 10 km, then the entire period 04:47:30 to 05:05 UT\nwould have corresponded to the second gyro-harmonic and\nthe optical enhancement asymmetry would be even more\npronounced. We conclude that our Digisonde analysis is cor-\nrect and a small change in altitude (<10 km) does not affect\nthe results. As mentioned earlier, the Digisonde data comes\npredominantly from vertically overhead whereas the pump\nbeam was pointed into the magnetic zenith (15\u25e6 off vertical).\nRefraction lowers the reflection altitude by <10 km, which is\nwithin the measurement uncertainty. Also, by the argument\ngiven above, a small reduction in reflection altitude does not\naffect the conclusions derived from this experiment.\nTo summarize, pumping just above the second gyro-\nharmonic has the opposite effect to pumping on higher gyro-\nharmonics, namely, there is an enhancement in the artificial\noptical emissions. This is consistent with the optical ob-\nservations by Haslett and Megill (1974) and enhanced stri-\nations observed by Fialer (1974), and is expected theoreti-\ncally (Das and Fejer, 1979; Grach, 1979). The maximum\noptical enhancement occurs when the pump frequency is\n\u223c7 kHz above the second gyro-harmonic, consistent with\nGrach\u2019s (1979) theoretical prediction that varying the pump\nfrequency by 1.5\u20132% would make the effect disappear.\nHence, we provide the first optical experimental evidence of\nan asymmetry about the gyro-harmonics, with brighter op-\ntical enhancements for a pump frequency slightly above the\nsecond gyro-harmonic, which was theoretically predicted by\nIstomin and Leyser (2003). The enhanced optical emissions,\nand their asymmetry about the gyro-harmonic, are consistent\nwith radar backscatter observations by Fialer (1974). Unfor-\ntunately, we have no radar data to corroborate this.\n3 Conclusions\nArtificial optical emissions in the ionospheric F-layer have\nbeen produced at the HAARP facility whilst passing through\nthe second gyro-harmonic frequency. A strong enhancement\nin the 630 and 557.7 nm emissions was observed, which is\nopposite to observations at higher gyro-harmonics. Theory\npredicts a lowering of the threshold for the thermal paramet-\nric instability in a plasma where the magnetic field and den-\nsity gradients are anti-parallel, as is the case in the F-region.\nHowever, it is not clear whether this will automatically lead\nto an enhancement of the striations or greater acceleration of\nthe electrons.\nThe ratio I(557.7)\/I(630) remains fairly constant around\nthe second gyro-harmonic frequency, indicating that the elec-\ntron acceleration mechanism has not changed significantly.\nThe increased accelerated electron flux, as witnessed by the\noptical data, indicates that the acceleration mechanism is\nmore efficient just above the second gyro-harmonic. This\nsuggests that the striations are enhanced when pumping near\nthe second gyro-harmonic, although we have no direct evi-\ndence for this.\nThe optical enhancement maximised for a pump frequency\nslightly above (\u223c7 kHz) the second gyro-harmonic. The the-\nory of cylindrical upper-hybrid oscillations trapped within\nstriations predicts an asymmetry of the optical signature\nabout a gyro-harmonic frequency, although the second gyro-\nharmonic was not specifically dealt with. We provide the first\noptical experimental evidence for this effect.\nArtificial optical emissions are produced for pump fre-\nquencies above (up to \u223c400 kHz) the nominal ionospheric\ncritical frequency. In this situation the pump wave does\nM. Kosch et al.: Artificial optical emissions at HAARP 1591\nnot reflect, providing evidence that upper-hybrid waves are\nimportant for accelerating the electrons. Spatially irregular\nenhanced optical emissions were observed, which may be\ndue to upper-hybrid resonance occurring over an extended\nheight range giving a brighter column emission. The ex-\ntended height range is due to the very low gradient in plasma\ndensity, which occurs near the F-region peak. The patchy\nstructure of the optical emissions is probably due to the\n\u201cimaging\u201d of large-scale plasma density irregularities in the\nF-layer.\nAcknowledgements.
