Treating church \ngroups as social spaces in which AIDS-related stigma may potentially be challenged, we systematically \nreview this literature, identifying five themes that highlight the complex and contradictory role of the church \nas a potential agent of health-enhancing social change. In many ways the church perpetuates AIDS \nstigma through i) moralistic attitudes and ii) its reinforcement of conservative gender ideologies, often \nleading to the denial of AIDS in public church settings. However some churches have managed move \ntowards action that makes a more positive contribution to HIV\/AIDS management through iii) promoting \nvarious forms of social control for HIV prevention, iv) contributing to the care and support of the AIDS-\naffected and v) providing social spaces for challenging stigmatising ideas and practices. We conclude that \nchurch groups, including church leadership, can play a key role in facilitating or hindering the creation of \nsupportive social spaces to challenge stigma. Much work remains to be done in developing deeper \nunderstandings of the multi-layered factors that enable some churches, but not others, to respond \neffectively to HIV\/AIDS.  \n \nKey words: Community responses; church groups; religion; stigma; AIDS; Africa \n \nSuggested running head: Creating social spaces to tackle AIDS-related stigma \n \nIntroduction \nReligion is a significant social force in Africa, where traditional and more mainstream religions have long \nhad a stronghold. Numerous Christian church groups and sects have emerged and developed since \nChristianity was first introduced. In the year 2000 there were an estimated 390 million Christians in Africa, \na number which is estimated to increase to 640 million by 2025 as Africa becomes the continent of most \nChristians and of as many Muslims as Asia (1). As religion shapes the beliefs and activities of many \npeople, it is vital, in the context of HIV\/AIDS, that we understand how religions and their growing number \nof adherents either facilitate or undermine stigma. Defining churches as any body of worshippers in the \nChristian faith, our literature review seeks to generate examples and lessons for \u2018best practice\u2019 in the \ninterests of informing the increasingly frequent calls for churches to play a greater role in empowering \ncommunities to deal more effectively with HIV\/AIDS. Such calls are made on the grounds that (a) \nchurches are often the most well established community networks in AIDS vulnerable communities, and \nthus potentially have wide influence; and (b) that church teachings of love and care open up many \npotential spaces for an increased positive role in supporting people living with HIV\/AIDS (PLWHA). By \nbringing together research findings on church groups from different sub-Saharan African countries we \nhope to advance understandings of how churches can respond positively to the AIDS epidemic and \nhighlight some of the existing challenges. A better understanding of the potential of church groups to \nprovide supportive social spaces for tackling HIV-related stigma could be an important first step in \ninforming those church leaders seeking to construct a theology which supports greater church involvement \nin supporting PLWHA (2, 3), one which challenges the church\u2019s historically very conservative views on \nsexuality, youth and female empowerment which may sometimes unintentionally undermine the fight \nagainst HIV\/AIDS (4). \n \nHIV\/AIDS-related stigma is increasingly regarded as one of the key drivers of the epidemic in sub-Saharan \nAfrica, primarily through the role stigma plays in undermining the ability of individuals, families and \nsocieties to protect themselves from HIV, to provide assistance to those affected, and to access services \nand adhere to treatment if they become infected (5, 6). This, coupled with the growing emphasis on the \nneed to facilitate local community responses to HIV\/AIDS through participation (7, 8), suggest there is an \nurgent need to uncover what kind of participation community members can engage in to minimise AIDS-\nrelated stigma and through what networks this participation should take place.  \n \nTwo tentative bodies of research point to this as a productive area for future research. Firstly, Low-Beer & \nStoneburner (9) and Epstein (10) argue that relatively high levels of social communication about HIV\/AIDS \nin informal grassroots networks may have served as one key catalyst for the behaviour change \ndocumented in Uganda in the 1990s. They argue that communication in face-to-face local networks \nreduces levels of stigma \u2013 making it more likely that people will make optimal use of HIV-prevention and \nAIDS-care information and services. The second group of studies are framed within the context of on-\ngoing debates about the impact of social capital on health (11). These studies provide preliminary \nevidence that membership of certain grassroots social groupings can play a role in shaping how members \nrespond to the HIV\/AIDS epidemic. Three separate studies in South Africa and Zimbabwe have suggested \nthat participation in certain (but not all) types of local community groupings might create social spaces that \nare protective of group members\u2019 sexual health. In South Africa, Camlin and Snow (12) have identified \nparticipation in clubs and community groups to be associated with safer HIV-related behaviours. \nElsewhere in South Africa, Campbell, Williams et al. (13) have pointed towards the complex impacts of \ngroup membership on peoples\u2019 responses to HIV\/AIDS. They found that young women who belonged to \nyouth groups and sports clubs were less likely to be HIV positive and less likely to have casual partners \nthan non-members, but that members of savings groups, with meetings accompanied by social events \nincluding alcohol consumption, put savings group members at higher risk than non-members. A study in \nZimbabwe found that it was not so much group membership per se that facilitated health-enabling \nbehaviours. It was belonging to what members perceived to be an effective group, that was associated \nwith reduced HIV infection (14).  \n \nAgainst this background, this paper seeks to further our understandings of the role that indigenous \ncommunity group memberships might play in reducing stigma and facilitate support \u2013 with particular \nemphasis on the role of the church. As already stated, in  many sub-Saharan African settings, the church \nis the most well-established social network (15), and as such could potentially serve as a vital community \nresource, especially in settings with limited access to health and welfare support and services. \nFurthermore religious teachings specifically emphasise the importance of supporting the sick and the \nneedy \u2013 which would point to the potential for this group to make a valuable contribution to strengthening \nlocal responses to AIDS. Agadjanian (16) argues that church groups in Africa are key to creating social \nspaces that nurture social interaction and exposure to social issues. However, the extent to which these \nsocial spaces facilitate or hinder support for PLWHA, and promote or challenge stigmatising attitudes \nremains unexplored. Creating communities where those with HIV\/AIDS are treated with love, care and \ncompassion is seen as a key element of stigma reduction, and to this extent the church would seem like a \nstrong potential player in HIV\/AIDS management. However, as will be highlighted below, the church has \nplayed a complex and contradictory role in responding to HIV\/AIDS, due to its traditionally conservative \nand judgemental views of \u2018sexual transgressors\u2019 and the historical disapproval of many churches to \ncondoms. Against this background the church is often seen as a driver of stigma rather than a solution. \nOur review of the existing literature on church responses to HIVAIDS in sub-Saharan Africa tackles the \nfollowing questions: \n \n1. What role do the churches currently play in contributing to HIV\/AIDS-related stigma? \n2. What role do the churches currently play in tackling HIV\/AIDS-related stigma? \n \nConceptual Framework \nThe starting point of our paper is that community groups (in this case church groups) can serve as social \nspaces in which people can formulate local responses to HIV\/AIDS. We use a \u2018social space\u2019 perspective \nto shed light on some of the resources and processes within church groups (understood as potential social \nspaces for debate, discussion and the negotiation of new social norms) that can challenge AIDS-related \nstigma and facilitate supportive attitudes towards PLWHA. According to Buttimer (17), the concept of \nsocial space was first used by Durkheim in the 1890s where he referred to social space as the social \nenvironment, or group framework, in which one is located. Within psychology, \u2018social space\u2019 has been \nused to refer to the symbolic and interactional sites in which social representations, shared knowledge and \nmeaning, social identifications as well as \u2018recipes for living\u2019 (socially negotiated behavioural possibilities \nand options) are constructed and reconstructed through the process of communication as social actors go \nabout their daily lives (18, 19).  \n \nBuilding on these perspectives, we view churches as potential interactional contexts in which people \nnegotiate their collective responses to social challenges (in this case HIV\/AIDS), offering the potential for \ninteractants to challenge social representations that encourage harmful and disempowering behaviours \n(e.g. stigmatising representations of HIV\/AIDS), and construct social representations that are more \npositive and enabling. To explore this further, we draw on our evolving concept of an \u2018AIDS-competent \ncommunity context\u2019, defined as a social space in which local community members are most likely to work \ncollectively to change their behaviour, support people with HIV\/AIDS and their carers, and challenge \nstigma (20-22). Campbell and colleagues point to six features of a supportive social space:  \n \n\uf0a7 The presence of HIV\/AIDS-related knowledge and skills;  \n\uf0a7 Opportunities for critical dialogue and debate about HIV\/AIDS;   \n\uf0a7 A sense of individual and collective ownership of the problem and responsibility for contributing to \nits solution;  \n\uf0a7 Confidence in the existence of individual, group and community strengths which could be \nmobilised to fight the epidemic;  \n\uf0a7 A sense of solidarity amongst group members around tackling HIV\/AIDS; and \n\uf0a7 Strong links with potential support agencies in the public and private sector outside of the \ncommunity (bridging or linking social capital).  \n \nIdeally social spaces facilitate opportunities for people to discuss and challenge negative representations \nof HIV\/AIDS and those affected by it \u2013 through developing new and less stigmatising understandings (20, \n22). Viewing churches and church-groups as social spaces that can potentially play a key role in HIV\/AIDS \nmanagement and stigma-reduction campaigns, we will use the concept of \u2018AIDS-competent community\u2019 as \na framework for this paper\u2019s discussion of the two questions outlined above. \n Identifying and organising the literature \nIn this review we draw on peer-reviewed articles only. We used electronic databases (Medline, Pubmed, \nPopline, PsychInfo, African Journals Online (AJOL), Google Scholar and Web of Knowledge\/Science) to \nidentify studies by drawing on a combination of the key words \u2018AIDS\u2019, \u2018HIV\u2019, \u2018treatment\u2019, \u2018care\u2019, \u2018prevention\u2019, \n\u2018stigma\u2019, \u2018church\u2019, \u2018faith groups\u2019, \u2018religion\u2019, \u2018sub-Saharan Africa\u2019 and \u2018Africa\u2019. We also drew on \u2018The \nCartography of HIV and AIDS, Religion and Theology\u2019 (23), a recently completed bibliography which has \nidentified 1,779 resources related to AIDS and religion. Reference lists from key articles, books and review \narticles were scanned to identify further peer-reviewed studies for possible inclusion. To limit the number \nof articles included for this discussion, as well as to identify studies relevant to our objective, included only \npeer-reviewed studies presenting empirical evidence, or reviews of empirical studies, that discussed ways \nin which Christian congregations and denominational organisations (henceforth church groups) in sub-\nSaharan Africa responded to HIV\/AIDS.  \n \nAs we worked our way through the many potential sources, we began by focusing carefully on article titles \nand abstracts. This was followed by an intensive reading of the full texts of articles of interest and \nrelevance to our research questions. A total of 37 articles were identified for the inclusion of this review \n(see Table 1 for characteristics of included studies). As each author independently read the articles each \nof us made notes of what we perceived to be the core themes emerging from the studies. A comparison of \nour notes, and discussion of emerging themes led us to identify five core questions which best framed the \ndiscussion of these issues in the reviewed studies. These questions constitute the five headings under \nwhich we present the findings of our literature review below.   \n \n \nTable 1: Summary of 37 included studies \n \n \nWhat representations held within church groups hinder their responses to AIDS and \ncontribute to stigma?   \nThe devastating impact of AIDS has led many people to seek answers and meaning from various sources, \nincluding Christianity. Peoples\u2019 understandings of, and responses to, HIV\/AIDS are therefore often filtered  \nthrough religious beliefs in a process that seeks to \u201cmake the unfamiliar familiar\u201d by anchoring \nunderstandings of the new phenomenon of HIV\/AIDS into peoples\u2019 pre-existing understandings of the \nsocial world (24, p.235). One particular framework through which HIV\/AIDS has often been interpreted is \nthat of a conservative church morality which typically includes the stigmatisation of sexuality, particularly \nthe sexuality of women and young people (4). As HIV-infection is primarily transmitted through sex, which \nchurches emphasise should only occur in the marriage of a sexually monogamous  man and woman, \npeople come to understand and associate HIV\/AIDS with immoral behaviours, linked to the underlying \nassumption that HIV\/AIDS should not be a risk for those who adhere to the teachings of the church.  \n \nWhilst this process of \u2018making the unfamiliar familiar\u2019 serves to assist those trying to make sense of their \neveryday lives in a context of AHIV\/IDS, the anchoring of understandings of AIDS within such a framework \nleads to church members framing HIV\/AIDS in images of sin and punishment, perpetuating AIDS-related \nstigma. A number of recent studies identify this relationship. In a quantitative study amongst Catholic, \nLutheran, and Pentecostal church-goers in Tanzania for example, Zou, Yamanaka et al. (25) found \nshame-related HIV\/AIDS stigma to be closely associated with religious beliefs. Just over half (53.2%) of \ntheir respondents believed HIV\/AIDS was a punishment from God, even more so amongst rural \nparticipants. Similarly, a third of respondents argued that PLWHA had not followed the word of God \nthrough engaging in sinful actions (immoral behaviour).  \n \nOur literature review also highlighted ways in which PLWHA internalised a sense of shame, voluntarily \nexcluding themselves from church groups. In Tanzania for example, Watt, Maman et al. (26) found that \nself-stigmatisation, linked to the notion of \u2018sinful\u2019 sexual behaviour, led PLWHA to avoid involvement in \nchurch groups \u2013 particularly if they were visibly ill. HIV positive church members feared disclosing their \nHIV status, particularly in churches where nobody else had disclosed. They feared that other church \nmembers would regard them as having sinned, leading to what they feared would be unbearably hurtful \nand humiliating responses of blame and judgement. Similarly, a Ugandan study reported how the \nmoralistic attitudes preached by church groups led both to self-stigma, withdrawal from religious activities \nand feelings of anger for the way in which some ministers spoke demeaningly of PLWHA (27).  \n \nThere was an associated tendency for churches to speak more of HIV prevention, and less of the \nchallenges of living with HIV\/AIDS and undergoing treatment, or of  the potential role of church members \nin supporting PLWHA (26). HIV prevention messages preached in churches were often limited to \nabstinence and fidelity (reinforcing dominant church moralities and understandings of sexuality), which \nsometimes clashed with \u2018mainstream\u2019 HIV prevention campaigns. Pfeiffer (28), reporting on the Jeito \ncampaign in Mozambique \u2013 a condom social marketing campaign \u2013 found church leaders regarded pro-\ncondom health messages as sinful, based on their belief that those who adhered to church teachings \nwould not need condoms. This implicitly stigmatised anyone wishing to use a condom. More widely it has \nbeen suggested that, within church groups, condoms have come to represent \u2018a tool for unfaithful wives\u2019 \n(29) or for those who have premarital sex. The Mozambican example highlights how mainstream \nmessaging about condoms may contradict the positions adopted by powerful churches, highlighting the \nneed to involve church leaders in discussions about the design of health campaigns. \n \nMany churches draw a link between HIV\/AIDS, condom use and immorality in a way that risks \nundermining HIV prevention efforts through suggesting that only non-believers are at risk, with church \nmembers less likely to feel at risk of contracting HIV or to think they need to use condoms. Church \nmembers distance themselves from the \u2018immoral people\u2019 that HIV prevention messages target. Lagarde, \nEnel et al. (30) observed that people who self-identified as religious were less likely to display HIV-\npreventive behaviours than those who attached less importance to religion. Similarly, findings in Zambia  \n(31) suggested that whilst membership of a church was likely to lead to first sexual experience at a later \nage, members were  less likely to use condoms once they started to have sex. Focusing specifically on \nmigrant youth in Nigeria, Smith (32) found popular religious teachings about  HIV led church-going youth \nto perceive themselves as at little or no risk, leading to inconsistent protective practices. The positive \neffect of religious teachings in delaying sexual debut were countered by the subsequent reduced \nlikelihood of people using condoms through a false sense of security.   \n An additional issue linked to the close association between HIV\/AIDS, sexuality and shame was the extent \nto which this limited open discussion of HIV\/AIDS by church leaders, thereby reinforcing HIV\/AIDS-related \nstigma. Exploring the extent to which church groups fuelled  stigma, Haddad (3) found that whilst many \nsouthern African church leaders did not condemn HIV\/AIDS management strategies, their self-\nidentification  as \u2018holy\u2019 people prevented them from developing new and creative ways of talking about sex \nand HIV transmission, in the light of the taboo nature of discussions of sexuality within church settings.  \n \nSimilar struggles have been identified in Burkina Faso in a project that sought to educate pastors of the \nAssemblies of God about HIV\/AIDS and mother-to-children transmission (MTCT). Although pre-test-post \ntest examination, as well as a later follow-up, showed pastors had understood and had retained the \nknowledge, only a fraction had discussed MTCT in their churches (33). One contributing factor could be \nthe challenges of discussing new problems and solutions using old speech and traditional theology. In \nTanzania, many church leaders lacked the vocabulary and confidence to talk about HIV\/AIDS-related \nstigma and were reluctant even to try to do this because of continued opposition of senior pastors (32).  \n \nThe anchoring of HIV\/AIDS within existing religious frameworks of meaning contributes to stigma through \nrendering it literally \u2018unspeakable\u2019 in terms other than immorality and shame. Furthermore, churches\u2019 \nframing of HIV\/AIDS within discourses of immorality and sin foregrounds \u2018bad' individuals and their \nspecific behaviours in understanding HIV transmission, rather than opening opportunities for discussions \nof the social roots of HIV\/AIDS (e.g. in factors such as the interface of poverty, age and gender in some \nsettings). This limits the possibility of critical thinking around stigma, which would be the starting point for \nthe development of more constructive and less stigmatising understandings of, and responses to, \nHIV\/AIDS.  \n \nHow does the linking of AIDS and sin relate to representations of gender in ways that \nintensify AIDS-related stigma? \nSeveral papers in our literature review highlighted how the link between HIV\/AIDS and \u2018immoral\u2019 sexual \nbehaviour had been interpreted and extended to reinforce patriarchal social relations, often undermining \nthe likelihood that women would take control of their sexual health and protect themselves from HIV-\ninfection, or that PLWHA will receive the love, care and support that church members frequently offered  \nthe sick in the case of less controversial diseases.  \n \nPreaching around HIV\/AIDS often involved selected emphases on the more conservative aspects of the \nBible; in the process disregarding those aspects that would be more supportive of women\u2019s right to health \nand respect, accepting of female and youth sexuality and lay greater emphasis on the forgiveness of \nsinners. Looking at Evangelical churches in three sub-Saharan Africa countries, Marshall and Taylor (29) \nfound churches to reinforce traditional values of female subservience and male dominance, including the \nsubmission of women to male desires, putting young women under strong pressure to be sexually active \u2013 \nand in so doing contributing to escalating HIV infection rates.  \n \nConservative gender ideologies bolstered through the teachings of most African churches have been \nobserved to negatively impact on women\u2019s knowledge about HIV\/AIDS, and in turn their sexual behaviour. \nIn a study of religious involvement and HIV\/AIDS prevention in Mozambique, Agadjanian (34) found that \nwomen involved in some religious congregations, particularly Pentecostal-type churches, had less \nknowledge about HIV preventative measures than  women in more mainstream churches, such as the \nRoman Catholic and Protestant churches. Yet Takyi,  (35) in a study in Ghana, found female church \nmembers to be better informed about HIV\/AIDS than women who were not church members.  \n \nChurches also tend to emphasise the sacredness of heterosexual marriage, reinforcing patriarchal social \nrelations, undermining married people\u2019s perceived sense of risk of HIV as well as intensifying the \nstigmatisation of homosexuals. According to Marshall and Taylor (29) and Otolok-Tanga, Atuyambe et al. \n(27) married women are at particular risk of contracting HIV in many sub-Saharan Africa countries. Many \nwomen enter a marriage, either feeling a false sense of security about their sexual health, or unable to \nnegotiate condom use for fear that this would be associated with distrust or promiscuity. In a study of \nUgandan church groups, Otolok-Tanga, Atuyambe et al. (27), found that their emphasis on fidelity within \nmarriage, and members\u2019 belief that the sexual health of married people was not at risk, hindered people \nfrom developing a realistic sense of the possibility of contracting HIV from their marriage partner.  \n \nFurthermore the emphasis of many religions on the desirability of heterosexual marriage can lead to the \nostracising of those engaging in same-sex activities (36). A study of the experiences of men who have sex \nwith men in Nigeria (36) found that their churches and pastors openly condemned homosexuality. This \nserved to distance them from the church, increased the stigma associated with this high risk group, and \nreinforced the conviction that \u2018good\u2019 people within the church were not at risk from contracting HIV. Such \ndistancing and \u2018othering\u2019 can lead to the reinforcement of personal or internalised stigma by homosexual \nchurch members, or people living with HIV\/AIDS, making them believe that they are to blame for their \nsexuality and contracting of HIV (37).  \n \nIn short, the studies above suggest that in many settings church teachings are actively contributing to the \nperpetuation of gendered inequalities and the perpetuation of traditional values, through promoting \nconservative gender ideologies and emphasising heterosexual marriage, limiting people\u2019s (especially \nwomen\u2019s) knowledge of HIV\/AIDS. They serve to represent HIV\/AIDS as a problem that is located outside \nof the church, as well as undermining women\u2019s ability to take control of their sexual health. In this sense \nHIV-related stigma can be understood as a form of psychological policing of the sexuality of young people, \nwomen and homosexuals, serving as a form of \u2018symbolic punishment\u2019 those who have challenged or \nbreached social hierarchies and conservative systems of social control (4). Within such contexts the \nemergence of social spaces in which HIV-related stigma can be challenged are highly constrained.  \n \nThe preceding two sections have highlighted how many church groups perpetuate representations of sex, \nmorality and gender that continue to limit the fight against HIV\/AIDS in many African settings. \nRepresentations of HIV\/AIDS as a disease of sin, shame and deviating sexuality, in the language of \nconservative  traditional values, continue to marginalise the groups of people at high risk of HIV\/AIDS, \nsuch as women and homosexuals. However, the impact of any social institution will always be too \ncomplex to summarise in one-dimensional stereotypes. Our review also provided some evidence for \npositive impacts of church membership in relation to HIV\/AIDS management in certain settings. We turn to \nexamine these in the following three sections.  \n \nWhat is the impact of churches\u2019 role in forms of social control that facilitate HIV \nprevention?   \nWhilst many of the representations examined in the two preceding sections limit church response to \nPLWHA and contribute to stigma, they may also paradoxically contribute to a level of social control that \nmay contribute to HIV prevention in some situations. On the one hand, the social control demonstrated by \nmany church groups goes against the spirit of standard international criteria for HIV\/AIDS control (e.g. 38), \nthrough perpetuating stigmatising links between HIV\/AIDS and sin, and through supporting unequal \ngender relations that undermine women\u2019s ability to negotiate safer sexual encounters. On the other hand, \nsome commentators argue that western-dominated conceptualisations of \u2018sexual empowerment\u2019 may not \nbe appropriate, or effective, in all settings, and that the social control imposed by many churches may \nsometimes, de facto, help curb the spread of AIDS.  \n \nSome studies suggest that the social and sexual control of church members can lead to a reduction of \nhigh risk sexual behaviours. In South Africa for example, Garner (39) found some churches influenced \ntheir members to reduce extra- and pre-marital sexual activity in order to minimise their risks for AIDS. \nSimilarly, in Ghana, the preaching of various Pentecostal and Evangelical churches against \u2018immoral \nsexual behaviours\u2019 has served to encourage early and faithful marriages and reduce polygamous unions \n(40). In Kenya, the Deliverance church promotes abstinence before marriage, fidelity within marriage and \nmandatory HIV testing for those getting married \u2013 highlighting which Parsitau (41) refers to as the social \nand sexual discipline of church members. In some contexts such efforts may have been successful in \nreducing risk behaviours. In Malawi, Trinitapoli and Regnerus (42) found that married men belonging to a \nPentecostal church reported lower levels of HIV risk behaviour than men of other faith groups, and that \nregular church attendance, regardless of denomination, was associated with fewer extramarital partners \nwhich served as an important factor in reducing HIV-related risk behaviours.  \n However, different church groups have varying levels of influence on members\u2019 sexual behaviours (41). In \nZimbabwe Gregson, Zhuwau et al. (43) found Spirit-type churches more likely to control members\u2019 alcohol \nconsumption and extra-marital affairs than Mission churches. Garner (39), looking at different Christian \ndenominations in South Africa, found that only Pentecostal churches had any significant impact on \nreducing extra- and pre-marital sex. He identified four key variables to explain this level of social control: \nindoctrination, religious experience, exclusion and socialisation. The Pentecostal churches had tighter \ncontrol over members\u2019 behaviour, backed up by their authority to expel or exclude those who chose to \nreject this control (39). Such disciplining was also observed by Trinitapoli (44) in a more recent study in \nMalawi. However, she found that the monitoring of church members\u2019 sexual behaviour was only one effort \nof several strategies by church leaders to curb the spread of HIV\/AIDS. Members of congregations where  \npastors monitored their sexual behaviour, spoke openly about HIV\/AIDS and delivered HIV prevention \nmessages as well as privately encouraging condom use and were most likely to be abstain, be faithful and \nuse condoms (the so-called ABC of HIV prevention).  \n \nHowever, the situation is more complex than this, with some studies suggesting that church discipline can \nlead to negative HIV risk outcomes. Work in Zambia by Agha, Hutchinson et al. (2006) found little \ndifference in HIV-prevalence levels between religious groups that excommunicate members for engaging \nin premarital sex and oppose condom use, and those who do not. Young women affiliated with \nconservative and more controlling groups are more likely to delay sexual initiation but less likely to use \ncondoms during first sex (perhaps due to some church members not viewing themselves at risk, as \ndiscussed above) - cancelling out the potential HIV prevention benefits of delayed first sex. These findings \nare also reflected in a similar Zimbabwean study (44). Overall, the potential for discipline and social \ncontrol to lead to reduced risk behaviours remains unclear.   \n \nIn what ways can church groups and faith provide support to people living with AIDS? \nEven amidst much evidence for their role in perpetuating stigma and undermining prevention efforts, there \nis also much evidence for church groupings contributing to the care and support of those infected and \naffected by HIV\/AIDS. According to Becker and Geissler (45) church groups are ideally placed to do this \nthrough their commitment to traditional values of solidarity as well as the fact that they are truly \ncommunity-based. Looking at the Redeemed Christian Church of God in Nigeria, Adogame (46) argues \nthat Pentecostal churches, whose conceptualisation of disease and healing is central to their responses to \nHIV\/AIDS, need to be acknowledged for their efforts to combat the epidemic and provide care and support \nfor those infected. Drawing on qualitative data from Malawi, Trinitapoli (47) found that many church groups \nin rural Malawi are  involved in caring for the sick, sponsoring HIV\/AIDS education programs for youth, \nand emphasizing the care of orphans as a religious responsibility. A study in Botswana observed that \u2013 in \nthe context of modernity and changes to traditional values and customs \u2013 Christian values may provide a \nframework that enables poor communities to cope with the care and support of children affected by AIDS \n(48). Looking at Church members in Ghana, Bazant and Boulay (49) found that the greatest contributing \nfactor to the care and support of PLWHA by church group members was whether respondents had heard \ntheir leader publicly speak about HIV\/AIDS.  \n \nHaving said this, Agadjanian and Sen (50) in their study in Mozambique found the involvement of church \ngroups in the provision of assistance to be limited to psychological support and personal care, neglecting \nmany of the material and financial needs of those affected. This probably partly reflects the poverty of \nmany churches and church members, but could also be an indicator of resource-based stigma (namely  \nthe belief that PLWHA are not deserving of material support or services). They also found financial \nconstraints and institutional rivalry to be a hindrance to the cooperation of religious organizations in the \nprovision of assistance to PLWHA (ibid.). \n \nThe lack of resources, coupled with HIV-related stigma, could perhaps explain why Watt, Maman, et al. \n(26) in Tanzania found personal faith to be important for PLWHA, with formal church membership having \nno influence, or a negative influence, on their experiences of living with HIV\/AIDS. So whilst formal \ninstitutionalised religious spaces might contribute to the stigmatisation of PLWHA, at a personal level \nPLWHA derived great comfort from their ability to confide in God and have an open relationship with God \n\u2013 a level of social support they were not getting elsewhere. In a Namibian study, Plattner and Meiring (37) \nfound religion to be an important framework used by PLWHA to make sense of their illness and to come to \nterms with it. The self-blame resulting from the church\u2019s teachings even helped some to make sense of \ntheir status in a way that increased their sense of control over their predicament. Almost all participants \nreported that since being diagnosed with HIV\/AIDS, religion had become very important to them \u2013 giving \nthem a sense of meaning and purpose to life.  \n \nThe contrasting findings of these studies highlight the complex and often contradictory impacts of social \nnetworks and their associated representations. Many church groups have the potential to provide \nsupportive social spaces for PLWHA (51), yet also hold oppressive views of PLWHA. Haddad (52) \nhighlights such contradictions, arguing that despite many positive moves by individual church leaders to \nget involved in HIV\/AIDS management, church groups as a whole are struggling to formulate a coherent \ntheology that enables them to acknowledge and support PLWHA in a loving Christian way, in the context \nof what they interpret as religiously informed imperatives to condemn the behaviours they believe have led \nto PLWHA\u2019s predicament. In the next section we discuss the movement within some church groups \ntowards the creation of more supportive social spaces even against the background of this complexity and \nambiguity.  \n \nHow can church groups create \u2018supportive social spaces\u2019? \nOne of the key drivers of HIV-related stigma is the lack of social spaces to talk about HIV\/AIDS and \nrelated concerns (5). Although, as already touched on above, many church pastors initially approached \nthe AIDS epidemic with silence and condemnation (52), a study of church leaders in Tanzania highlights \nthat they now include AIDS in their teachings, influencing the attitudes of church members and creating \nopportunities for social spaces characterised by reflection and compassion (53). Similar observations have \nbeen made in some settings in neighbouring Kenya (52) and Uganda (27) where church groups have \nbeen reported as open to engaging with HIV\/AIDS health education and actively encouraging discussions \nabout the subject of HIV\/AIDS with their parishioners. Trinitapoli (47) highlights that in rural Malawi \nreligious leaders discussed HIV\/AIDS with their congregations.  \n \nIn some settings, churches may also provide important spaces for congregants to disclose their HIV-\npositive status to church leaders. A study in Nairobi, Kenya, by Miller and Rubin (54) found that many \npeople disclosed their HIV-positive status to church pastors. Similar observations have been made in the \nRepublic of Congo where Maman, Cathcart et al. (55) found women to see church leaders as important \ntargets for disclosing their HIV status as well as supporting them through their decisions to disclose their \nstatus to others, including their husbands. If church leaders are understanding and accepting of people \nliving with HIV\/AIDS, and encourage more people to live positively, this may, as observed in Tanzania, \nhave wider positive impacts. Here it was found that if church members, or people affiliated to a church \ngroup, were open about their HIV status, non-disclosed members would find it easier to be open about \ntheir HIV status in turn (26).  \n \nStudies also highlight how in certain settings church groups have been able to renegotiate understandings \nof HIV\/AIDS in more positive, less morally charged ways that also encourage social action to tackle HIV\/ \nAIDS. Although the Catholic church condemned the use of condoms in 1993, and Protestant churches \noften condemn premarital sex, a study has found that church groups, youth groups affiliated to churches \nand religious schools in Kenya have resisted the moral doctrines of church leaders and actively engaged \nin HIV management and condom distribution programmes \u2013 creating important social spaces for the \nprevention of HIV (56). Similarly, a number of studies have emphasised how the church has allowed \npeople to reconstruct their ideas about HIV\/AIDS in a way that is meaningful to them. In the context of \nHIV\/AIDS in Uganda, the concept of \u2018Salvation\u2019 of the Pentecostal church has assumed renewed \nmeanings, encouraging young people to get involved in religious campaigns against AIDS (57). Dilger (58) \nfocusing on a neo-Pentecostal church in Tanzania, shows that in contexts characterised by high levels of \nHIV\/AIDS, poverty and economic insecurity, this church offers practices of healing and social support for \nthose living with HIV\/AIDS. It has provided a social space in which new understandings of HIV\/AIDS can \nemerge, after being interpreted through local understandings. It also offers a basis for action, as the \nchurch in Dilger\u2019s (58) study provided dense networks of economic and social support for all its members.  \n \nIn addition the Pentecostal church in Uganda has been observed to provide a social space where sexual \nbehaviour can be renegotiated. Looking at the relationship between materialism and sexual behaviours \namongst university students, Sadgrove (59) reports that student members of the Pentecostal church \ncreated \u2018born again\u2019 peer groups who sought to abstain from some of the high risk sexual practices found \non campus (particularly around transactional sex for material gains). Whilst the groups promoted sexual \nabstinence and anti-materialist rhetoric, however, broader socio-economic dynamics were found to \ninfluence the ways in which theologies were received and acted upon by church members \u2013 highlighting \nthe challenge of renegotiating identities and social spaces in economically deprived settings. \n \nWe have highlighted a range of studies across Africa that highlight how some church groups have \nprovided social spaces for challenging HIV-related stigma, through enabling open discussion of HIV\/AIDS, \ndisclosure of congregants\u2019 HIV-positive status and providing the impetus and starting point for social \naction. However, as will be discussed below, these important studies tend to be descriptive in nature, \npointing to outcomes of church efforts, rather than reporting on the processes through which some \nchurches have managed to respond positively to PLWHA. We will argue for the need for more in-depth \nanalysis of the processes through which some, but not other, churches or church leaders have managed \nto resist dominant stigmatising understandings of HIV\/AIDS and those affected by it.  \n \nWhat next? What is the potential of church groups in tackling HIV\/AIDS-related stigma? \nBefore we discuss the potential of church groups in tackling HIV\/AIDS-related stigma, a few limitations of \nthis study deserve mention. As already stated, most papers were descriptive and cross-sectional in their \ndesign, making it hard for us to say anything about the processes through which some churches and \nchurch members have been able to resist, subvert or work creatively with the AIDS-shame-sin \nrepresentation, or to make space for a more supportive acknowledgement of the humanity and dignity of \nHIV\/AIDS sufferers. We have sought to provide an overall picture of church groups, without seeking to \ndraw more fine-grained distinctions between different religious denominations (e.g. Catholic vs \nPentecostal churches) or their contextual locations (e.g. rural vs urban; country-specific features). \nFurthermore, as with any review, publication bias may have encouraged us to report disproportionately on \nchurches that have faced problems in building supportive and empowering responses to HIV\/AIDS, given \nthat problematic or fraught social situations often come to the attention of researchers more frequently \nthan more successful or harmonious ones.  \n \nAs we limited ourselves to the peer-reviewed literature, we may have missed out on important findings \nidentified by non-academic frontline health and welfare practitioners which are often published in the non-\nacademic \u2018grey\u2019  literature. Nevertheless, despite these limitations we believe that our review of the \npublished literature on HIV\/AIDS and the church in Africa provides a useful overview of the complex and \ncontradictory role of the church as a whole in perpetuating and challenging HIV-related stigma in Africa. \nAside from potentially problematic teachings communicated by churches, there may be other aspects of \nchurch existence that deter church groups from contributing effectively to HIV\/AIDS management, such as \nlack of resources for example, which featured in relatively few of our reviewed articles given our interest in \nrepresentational and symbolic factors rather than on material ones. There is a need to develop wider \nunderstandings of the social, economic and political contexts in which churches operate, that goes beyond \na focus on the potential  impacts of  religious teachings on the experiences and behaviours of their \ncongregants and PLWHA in the wider communities in which they are located.  \n \nWe have focused on the complex and contradictory ways in which HIV\/AIDS has been interpreted or \nanchored in pre-existing frameworks of knowledge and representation in various settings and highlighted \nthe way in which dominant notions of HIV\/AIDS have been refracted through conservative approaches to \nsex, sexuality and morality, often limiting the extent to which church groups can develop as social spaces \nwhich challenge HIV-related stigma. We now turn to reflect on the implications of our findings in the light of \nthe dimensions of an AIDS-competent community, outlined in our conceptual framework section above.  \n \nThe possibility that church groups might emerge as spaces for dialogue and critical thinking about \nHIV\/AIDS is severely curtailed by their anchoring of the condition in representations of immorality and sin, \noften rendering HIV\/AIDS almost literally \u2018unspeakable\u2019 in ways that are not associated with blame and \nshame. Where church leaders have managed to develop a language to talk about HIV\/AIDS openly, there \nis some evidence of the positive effect that this can have in challenging HIV-related stigma. This negative \nframing of HIV\/AIDS also serves to discourage critical thinking and dialogue regarding the social roots of \nHIV\/AIDS and HIV-related behaviour (in social conditions such as poverty, gender and\/or migrant labour in \nvarious contexts). The church\u2019s reinforcement of gender hierarchies is closely linked to the policing of \nyoung people\u2019s and women\u2019s sexuality and, as has been argued elsewhere (4), in such contexts HIV-\nrelated stigma serves as a symbolic punishment for those who have failed to respect socially prescribed \nnotions of morality. Thus, the potential for church groups to emerge as social spaces for dialogue and \ncritical thinking are severely curtailed in ways that actually often make the perpetuation of HIV-related \nstigma more likely.  \n \nChurch groups also offer the potential to provide spaces to identify group strengths available for \nresponding to HIV\/AIDS, another key feature of an AIDS competent community. Our review highlights the \nextent to which the church\u2019s more general representation of its role in the provision of care and support for \nthe sick potentially provides a vital tool to frame supportive attitudes to the sick and dying. Yet the extent \nto which church groups can make use of this representation as a framework for responding \ncompassionately and lovingly to people with HIV\/AIDS remains limited. Alongside widespread poverty \namongst many church groups, which limits the resources available to support the sick, this additional \nsymbolic constraint on church involvement limits its potential role in the struggle against HIV\/AIDS.  \n \nOur review also suggests that the capacity for church groups to serve as spaces for the emergence of an \nenhanced sense of community ownership of HIV\/AIDS management, is limited. Framing HIV\/AIDS as a \nproblem of \u2018sinners\u2019, locates those affected outside of the boundaries of \u2018moral, respectable and well-\nbehaved congregants\u2019 which forms such an important part of the self-presentation strategies and social \nidentities of so many church members. In such a context, PLWHA become the symbolic \u2018other\u2019 (60), \nagainst whom church members most explicitly seek to define themselves. This is particularly the case in \nrelation to many churches\u2019 extremely negative representations of non-heterosexual relationships and sex \noutside of marriage.  \n \nFinally the literature on church responses to HIV\/AIDS provides relatively little evidence for the forging of \nchurch links with potential support agencies outside of the church community in developing or \nstrengthening such responses. With notable exceptions, in many cases churches are not optimally \nintegrated in wider community or regional prevention or care activities. Given that many African \ncommunities and church groups operate in contexts of various forms of poverty and social marginalisation, \nlinks to outside agencies with the material and political power to support the development of effective \nresponses to tackling HIV\/AIDS and stigma remains very important. \n \nWe conclude by echoing Haddad\u2019s (2) argument that there is a strong need for churches to develop new \ntheologies \u2013 systems of representation and understanding that can assist church leaders in developing a \nmore explicit and confident role for the church to play in supporting people with HIV\/AIDS. Such theologies \ncould, for example, challenge stigma through emphasising those aspects of the Christian message that \npotentially advocate the forgiveness of sinners; the empowerment of women; a compassionate \nunderstanding of the impacts of poverty and other social inequalities on behaviour; and recognition of the \ninherent dignity of all human beings. While there may be resistance to such a move in some church circles, \nour review has highlighted evidence that some churches have been able to transform their values and \nattitudes to provide non-stigmatising care and support for people affected by HIV\/AIDS. Furthermore some \nreligious leaders and scholars have explicitly argued that churches should not only contribute to care and \ntreatment (e.g. 61), but also explicitly examine the role they can play in combating HIV\/AIDS-related \nstigma, opening up further spaces for the development of less stigmatising responses. \n \nFuture research directions \nThere is a pressing need for two forms of research to further actionable understandings in this area. The \nfirst relates to the need for more detailed naturalistic case studies of the processes through which some \nchurches, but not others, have organically developed creative and non-stigmatising responses to the \nchallenges of HIV\/AIDS. Our interest in naturalistic case studies of organic community responses to \nHIV\/AIDS is driven by our belief that indigenous and bottom up responses developed by local groupings \nthemselves are often more likely to be more feasible and sustainable vehicles of social change than \nactions imposed on communities by outside professionals and experts (e.g. NGOs, health promotion \nbodies, overseas development agencies and so on). Where possible, research should be longitudinal, \ntracking changes in church understandings and responses to HIV\/AIDS over time in order to understand \nthe processes through which stigmatising representations are reproduced or transformed in response to \nwider social changes \u2013 such as the growing availability of antiretroviral treatment in many settings, or  \nprogressive or conservative developments in international church doctrines, for example.  \n \nSuch studies need to be explanatory rather than descriptive in nature, underpinned by a theory of change, \nwhich identifies the processes through which negative social representations of HIV\/AIDS, and those \naffected by it, are sometimes resisted and transformed in a ways that lead to greater \u2018AIDS competence\u2019 \nby church groups (21, 22). We have sought to provide a starting point for such a theory of change in our \nown work on stigma reduction (5, 62). Here we draw on Paulo Freire\u2019s (63-65) accounts of the role that \nparticipatory dialogue and critical thinking can play in creating social spaces in which community groups \n(in this case church groups) can work to identify, challenge and reformulate disempowering social \nrepresentations (66, 67). We also emphasise the important role of supportive alliances between and \nacross the social and health sectors (including faith-based organisations, the NGO sector, the HIV\/AIDS \nsector and so on) in enabling community groups to translate new representations of social problems into \nfeasible and locally appropriate action strategies through which church groups might best support people \nliving with HIV\/AIDS.  \n \nThe most useful lessons come from documenting organic changes rather than externally imposed ones. \nHowever, growing attention is being paid to the role externally generated approaches such as \u2018action \nresearch\u2019 (68) or \u2018community-based participatory research\u2019 (69) can play in can play in opening  \nopportunities for marginalised communities to  debate ways in which their existing social representations \nmay perpetuate stigma and social exclusion, and undermine the likelihood of positive community action. \nSuch debates open the potential for developing new and more empowering understandings of HIV\/AIDS \nand how to tackle it (70). One particularly promising approach is Photovoice (71-74), where community \nmembers engage in facilitated discussions of photographs they themselves have taken, and which ideally \nserves as a springboard for positive social action in favour of socially excluded groups. We are currently \nengaged in an action research study using another such approach, that of \u2018community conversations\u2019 (75, \n76), with church groups in rural Zimbabwe. Our Zimbabwean study explores the potential for community \nconversations to provide opportunities for church members to renegotiate existing social identities (often \nbased on the \u2018othering\u2019 of those affected by HIV\/AIDS), generating less harmful understandings of the \nproblem, a greater sense of individual and group ownership of HIV\/AIDS-related problems as well as a \nsense of responsibility for tackling them, an enhanced sense of solidarity in addressing this challenge, and \nmobilising greater stocks of supportive social capital for doing so \u2013 all with the intention of building greater \nAIDS competence in churches.  \n \n \nReferences \n1.
