Introduction 53 \n 54 \nAflatoxins are produced by Aspergillus flavi group species and are thought to 55 \nbe one of the most cancerous natural substances known. Economically and 56 \nbiologically the most important fungal species able to produce the aflatoxins are A. 57 \nflavus and A. parasiticus (Bhatnagar et al., 2002). The aflatoxin biosynthesis gene 58 \ncluster of A. parasiticus has been completely elucidated (Yu et al., 2004). Moreover 59 \nthe genome of A. flavus is known and a whole genome microarray of A. flavus is 60 \navailable and has been used to study the regulation of aflatoxin biosynthesis genes 61 \n(O\u00b4Brian et al., 2003). Generally, the aflatoxin biosynthesis genes of A. flavus and A. 62 \nparasiticus are highly homologous and the order of the genes within the cluster being 63 \nthe same (Yu et al., 1995). A. flavus usually produces only aflatoxin B1 and B2. Not all 64 \nof the strains of A. flavus isolated from the natural habitat are able to produce these 65 \nmetabolites at least under laboratory conditions. On the other hand, A. parasiticus is 66 \na strong and consistent aflatoxin producing species (Bennett and Christensen, 1983; 67 \nVaamonde et al., 2003). Most strains of this species are able to produce the 68 \naflatoxins B1, B2, G1, and G2.  69 \nThe biosynthesis of aflatoxins, as all secondary metabolites, is strongly 70 \ndependent on growth conditions such as substrate composition (Luchese and 71 \nHarrigan, 1993) or physical factors like pH, water activity, temperature or modified 72 \natmospheres (Ellis et al., 1993; Molina and Gianuzzi, 2002; Ribeiro et al., 2006; 73 \nGiorni et al., 2008). Depending on the particular combination of external growth 74 \nparameters the biosynthesis of aflatoxin can either be completely inhibited, albeit 75 \nnormal growth is still possible or the biosynthesis pathway can be fully activated. 76 \nKnowledge about these relationships enables an assessment of which parameter 77 \ncombinations can control aflatoxin biosynthesis or which are conducive to phenotypic 78 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n \n4 \n \naflatoxin production. A mathematical model which delineates the relationship 79 \nbetween pH, propionic acid concentration and temperature on aflatoxin biosynthesis 80 \nby A. parasiticus was described by Molina and Giannuzzi (2002). Sweeney et al. 81 \n(2000) developed a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction to analyse the 82 \nexpression of the aflR and aflQ gene of the aflatoxin pathway in relation to various 83 \nnutritional media. Xu et al. (2000) monitored the expression of the aflD gene after 84 \ngrowth of A. parasiticus on peanut pods by a reporter gene approach. Mayer et al. 85 \n(2003) showed that expression of the aflD gene and the biosynthesis of aflatoxin in 86 \nwheat are directly coupled. Recently Price et al. (2005) used a whole genome 87 \nmicroarray approach to analyse the influence of substrate composition and pH on the 88 \nactivation of aflatoxin biosynthesis genes. With a pathway specific microarray and by 89 \nReal Time PCR the influence of physical parameters like water activity, temperature 90 \nand pH on the expression of ochratoxin A-, trichothecene- and aflatoxin biosynthesis 91 \ngenes have been analysed and a common expression profile was found (Schmidt-92 \nHeydt and Geisen, 2007). The published data show a correlation between external 93 \nparameters and gene expression, however no comprehensive systematic analysis of 94 \nthis in relation to aflatoxin production has been performed. Recently Georgianna and 95 \nPayne (2009) summarized the current knowledge of the regulation of aflatoxin 96 \nbiosynthesis in relation to external factors. 97 \n 98 \nIn the current work the influence of various combinations of the most important 99 \nphysical parameters, temperature and aw, on the regulation of the aflatoxin 100 \nbiosynthesis genes of A. flavus was systematically analysed. A basic model was 101 \ngenerated to visualize the correlation between parameter combinations and cluster 102 \ngene activation. This type of study is required to elucidate the pivotal role of 103 \nenvironmental factors in the activation of the aflatoxin biosynthesis genes.  104 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n \n5 \n \n2.

This strain produces high amounts of aflatoxin after growth on YES agar 110 \n(20 g\/l yeast extract, 150 g\/l sucrose, 15 g\/l agar) at 25 to 30 \u00b0C for 5 days. For 111 \nexpression and toxin analysis the agar plates were overlayed with sterile 8.5 112 \ncellophane sheets (P400, Cannings, Bristol, U.K.) and then single point inoculated 113 \ncentrally by applying 10 \u00b5l of a spore suspension (107 spores in TWS (0.5 % tween 114 \n80, 0.85 g\/l NaCl)). The water activity of the media was adjusted with glycerol by 115 \nusing glycerol\/water mixtures. The following amounts were used per litre (108 ml, 116 \n0.99; 13.1 ml, 0.98; 19.9 ml, 0.95; 24.5 ml, 0.93; 31.3 ml, 0.90). The water activity of 117 \nthe medium was verified by using an Aqua Lab Lite water activity meter (Graintec Pty 118 \nLtd). The plates were inoculated at the temperature indicated (15 \u2013 42 \u00b0C).  119 \n 120 \n2.2 Growth assessment 121 \n 122 \nFor measurement of the diametric mycelial growth rate, the diameter of the 123 \ncolony was measured in two directions at right angles to each other. The increase in 124 \ncolony radius was plotted and the linear regression lines for the linear phase were 125 \nused to obtain the relative growth rates (cm\/7days). The biomass was removed from 126 \nthe cellophane surface for extraction and molecular and aflatoxin analysis. All 127 \nexperiments were carried out with 3-4 replicates and some temperature treatments 128 \nrepeated for confirmation of results. 129 \n 130 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n \n6 \n \n2.3 Isolation of RNA from samples 131 \n 132 \nTo perform microarray experiments RNA was isolated using the RNAeasy 133 \nPlant Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). An amount of 1 g of the mycelium was 134 \nground with a mortar and pestel in liquid nitrogen. About 250 mg of the resulting 135 \npowder was used for isolation of total RNA. The powder was resuspended in 750 \u00b5l 136 \nlysis buffer, mixed with 7.5 \u00b5l \u03b2-mercaptoethanol and 100 glass beads with a 137 \ndiameter of 1 mm (B.

The extracts were mixed thoroughly and 139 \nincubated for 15 min at 55 \u00b0C and 42 kHz in an S10H  ultrasonic bath (Elma, Singen, 140 \nGermany). All further procedures were essentially the same as suggested by the 141 \nmanufacturer of the kit. 142 \n 143 \n2.4 Microarray experiments 144 \n 145 \ncDNA synthesis and labelling were performed using the Micromax Direct 146 \nLabeling kit (Perkin Elmer Life And Analytical Sciences, Inc.

After cDNA synthesis and labelling, the cDNA was 149 \npurified with the QiaQuick Min Elute kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The labelled and 150 \npurified cDNA was brought to dryness in a vacuum concentrator (Speed Vac, Savant 151 \nInstruments, Farmingdale, USA), resuspended in 60 \u00b5l hybridization buffer (Scienion, 152 \nBerlin, Germany), heated for 2 min. at 95 \u00b0C, place d on ice to prevent strand 153 \nrearrangement and hybridized for 18 h at 42 \u00b0C to t he microarray by using an 154 \nautomatic hybridization station (Perkin Elmer, Boston, USA).

After this time 190 \nthe activation of the aflatoxin biosynthesis gene cluster was determined by 191 \nmicroarray analysis. In parallel at each parameter combination the colony growth as 192 \nwell as the aflatoxin B1 produced was determined. The results obtained are shown in 193 \nFigure 1.  194 \n 195 \nThe growth rates follow a general pattern. At each temperature growth 196 \nincreased as aw was increased from 0.90 to 0.99. The growth optimum for this strain 197 \nwas at 37\u00b0C. At 25, 30 and 35 \u00b0C the biosynthesis p attern of aflatoxin followed the 198 \ngrowth rate and was high at 0.99 aw and low at 0.90 aw. Highest amounts of aflatoxin 199 \nwere produced between 25 and 30 \u00b0C, but also at 20 \u00b0C. Very low amounts were 200 \nproduced at \u226537 \u00b0C and at a w of 0.90. 201 \n 202 \nThe expression profiles of the aflatoxin cluster genes were co-ordinately 203 \nchanged in response to the environmental conditions and were partly inversely 204 \nrelated to the growth rate and also to aflatoxin biosynthesis. At intermediate 205 \ncombinations of temperature x aw (25 \u00b0C\/0.95 and 0.99; 30 \u00b0C\/0.95 and 0.99; 206 \n35 \u00b0C\/0.95 and 0.99) a high production of aflatoxin  B1 was observed despite the fact 207 \nthat the cluster genes are transcribed only to a certain basal level. At these 208 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n \n9 \n \ncombinations growth was moderate or close to the optimum. At combinations of 209 \ntemperature x aw which are less favourable for growth due to low aw or high 210 \ntemperature (25 \u00b0C\/0.90; 30 \u00b0C\/0.90; 37 \u00b0C\/0.90 and  0.95 and 0.99; 40 \u00b0C\/0.90 and 211 \n0.95 and 0.99; 42 \u00b0C\/0.99) the overall cluster gene s are induced when compared to 212 \nthe basal level. Interestingly most of the cluster genes are activated nearly to the 213 \nsame level for all these combinations except of some single genes which are 214 \nexpressed at a significantly higher level. Generally growth was significantly 215 \ndecreased at these stress conditions with an exception at 37\u00b0C\/0.99 where growth 216 \nwas at an intermediate level. Under these inducing conditions only very low amounts 217 \nof aflatoxin were produced. Even after prolonged incubation of A. flavus no increase 218 \nin aflatoxin concentration occurred (data not shown). An even more pronounced 219 \ninduction of several genes of the cluster could be observed at only one specific 220 \ncondition, e.g. 20\u00b0C\/0.99. At this condition, altho ugh growth is moderate high 221 \namounts of aflatoxin were produced. At combinations of 20 \u00b0C\/0.95 and 0.90 growth 222 \nwas practically inhibited and analysis was not possible. 223 \n 224 \n3.2 Expression of specific genes 225 \n 226 \nIt was noticeable that the expression of some genes was much higher than the 227 \ngeneral cluster gene expression level under certain parameter combinations. This 228 \nwas especially true for the aflS gene. The aflS (formerly aflJ) gene is a regulatory 229 \ngene which interacts and activates aflR, the major regulatory gene, which than 230 \nactivates the aflatoxin structural genes (Chang, 2003). At most conditions with a 231 \ntemperature >37\u00b0C the aflS gene expression was highly increased especially at 232 \n37\u00b0C\/0.90. At certain other parameter combinations at 20, 25 and 30\u00b0C the 233 \nexpression of the aflS gene was also increased when compared to the other genes of 234 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n \n10 \n \nthe cluster. This was often accompanied by an increased biosynthesis of aflatoxin 235 \ncompared to the neighbouring conditions. At conditions <37\u00b0C a reduction of the a w 236 \nto 0.90 did not lead to an increased expression of the aflS gene compared to the 237 \nother cluster genes. This lower activity of the aflS gene was always accompanied by 238 \na lower biosynthesis of aflatoxin (see Figure 1). At 20\u00b0C\/0.99 a w the aflS gene was 239 \nvery high expressed relative to the other genes and accompanied by a similar 240 \nactivation of the aflJ (formerly estA) gene. Under these conditions growth was 241 \nmoderate and aflatoxin biosynthesis high. At all analysed conditions the aflR gene 242 \nwas not prominently expressed and followed the general expression of the cluster 243 \ngenes. However the ratio of expression between the aflS and aflR gene seemed to 244 \nbe critical for aflatoxin biosynthesis (Table 1). At conditions with low aw (0.90) the 245 \nration is far below 1. At these conditions low amounts of aflatoxin are produced. At 246 \nmoderate conditions the ratio is more than 1. At these conditions high amounts of 247 \naflatoxin are produced. 248 \n 249 \n3.3 Differences in the regulation of the single cluster genes in relation to 250 \ncombinations of temperature and water activity 251 \n 252 \nIn order to compare the expression profiles of single genes in relation to both 253 \nparameters all expression data of the single genes were plotted against temperature 254 \nand aw (Figure 2). Based on the expression profiles, two groups of genes could be 255 \nidentified. The expression profile of group 1 is shown in Figure 2A. The following 256 \ngenes belonged to this group and all showed a very similar profile: aflM, aflE, aflH, 257 \naflJ, aflN, aflR, aflS, aflU, aflQ, aflX. The expression profile of the second group 258 \n(group 2) of genes is shown in Figure 2B. The following genes belong to this group: 259 \naflG, aflT, aflP, aflD, aflL, aflO, aflC, aflF, aflA, aflB, aflK, aflV, aflW, aflY. Also in this 260 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n \n11 \n \ngroup the expression patterns of all the genes were very similar and resembled the 261 \nprofile which is shown in Figure 2B. The genes aflS and aflJ, which were highly 262 \nexpressed under certain conditions, were both in group 1. When the two gene groups 263 \nare assigned to the cluster all of the group 1 genes are adjacently located covering 264 \nthe region from aflR to aflN. The other group is split and comprises the regions from 265 \nthe aflF to the aflA gene and from the aflG to the aflY gene. The only exception is the 266 \naflU gene, which belongs to the expression profile of group 1. The data suggests that 267 \ndifferent mechanisms are involved in the regulation of the two groups in relation to 268 \nenvironmental changes and that co-localization within the cluster might facilitate this 269 \ndifferent behaviour (Fig. 3). 270 \n 271 \n3.4 Matrix of aflatoxin cluster gene activation in relation to water activity and 272 \ntemperature 273 \n 274 \nBased on the expression data obtained during this systematic analysis a 275 \nmatrix of aflatoxin cluster gene expression in relation to aw and temperature could be 276 \ngenerated (Fig. 4). This matrix plots the level of induction versus certain 277 \ncombinations of aw levels and temperatures. Three sets of parameter combinations 278 \ncould be identified in this analysis. First parameter combinations which allow a basal 279 \nlevel of expression (Fig. 3, white squares) in the temperature range of 25-37\u00b0C at a w 280 \nlevels >0.90 (e. g. aw 0.95 and 0.99). These conditions support moderate to good 281 \ngrowth of A. flavus and are usually accompanied by high production levels of 282 \naflatoxin. A general activation level of the whole gene cluster with high expression of 283 \ncertain genes could be identified at all temperatures in combination with low aw (0.90) 284 \nor at temperatures >37\u00b0C (Fig. 3, light grey square s). These conditions impose stress 285 \non the fungus, growth is significantly reduced and very low amounts of aflatoxin are 286 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n \n12 \n \nproduced. Finally an activation level at which certain genes are very highly expressed 287 \n(aflS) could be identified at one unique combination only (20 \u00b0C\/0.99; Fig. 3, dark 288 \ngrey square). At this condition moderate growth is possible suggesting moderate 289 \nstress. Also at this condition high amounts of aflatoxin are produced. he reason why 290 \nthe expression behaviour at the combination 37\u00b0C\/0. 90 was not included in this last 291 \ngroup is because despite the quite high induction of the aflS gene, which was about 292 \nhalf of that at 20\u00b0C\/0.99, no increase in aflatoxin  production occurred. These results 293 \nsuggest that the stress level applied is due to these differences. Both situations are at 294 \nthe margins of the window for growth because adjacent combinations are no longer 295 \nsupportive for growth (e.g. 20\u00b0C\/0.95 and 40\u00b0C\/0.90 ). 296 \n 297 \n4. Discussion 298 \n 299 \nIn this study the regulation of the aflatoxin cluster genes of A. flavus in relation 300 \nto changing environmental parameters, especially temperature x aw combinations 301 \nhave been analysed using a toxin gene cluster microarray. Three types of cluster 302 \ngene expression could be observed, which appeared to be related to the level of 303 \nabiotic stress imposed. The involvement of abiotic stress in the activation of 304 \nmycotoxin biosynthetic genes have been described in several studies (Schmidt-Heydt 305 \net al., 2008; Jayashree and Subramanyam, 2000; Jurado et al., 2008; Kim et al., 306 \n2005; Ochiai et al., 2007; Kohut et al., 2009). In conditions favourable for growth of A. 307 \nflavus the cluster genes are expressed at a basal level with the strain producing high 308 \namounts of aflatoxin. Under mild stress conditions (20 \u00b0C\/0.99) several of the cluster 309 \ngenes, in particular aflS and aflJ were very highly induced concomitant with high 310 \nlevels of phenotypic aflatoxin production. Under increased stress conditions (0.90 aw 311 \nand >37 \u00b0C) the whole cluster was induced, with the  aflS expression being prominent 312 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n \n13 \n \nat certain parameter combinations (>37 \u00b0C), however  much less compared to the 313 \nformer situation. Under these conditions, surprisingly very low amounts of aflatoxin 314 \nwere produced. Similar behaviour was recently obtained for patulin biosynthesis 315 \n(Baert et al., 2007). These authors showed that mild stress imposed by abiotic factors 316 \ninduced patulin production, but higher stress was inhibitory. Similar effects were also 317 \nreported by Schmidt-Heydt et al. (2008) and Jurado et al. (2008) for mycotoxigenic 318 \nFusarium and Penicillium species. It may be that although the gene cluster is 319 \nexpressed above the basal level other posttranscriptional mechanisms impair 320 \naflatoxin biosynthesis. This mechanism might act at the stage of transcription, e. g. a 321 \nreduction of transcription or at the protein level, e. g. an inhibition of enzyme activity 322 \nby some kind of protein modification. Alternatively at the metabolic level the 323 \nconcentration of precursors or other metabolites required might be suboptimal. For 324 \nexample, even at the combination of 37\u00b0C\/0.90 where  a high activation of the aflS 325 \ngene occurred, similar to that at 20 \u00b0C\/0.99, only very low aflatoxin production was 326 \nobserved. Interestingly, both conditions are at the growth-no growth boundary where 327 \nconditions are very marginal for growth (no growth at 20\u00b0C\/0.95 and 40\u00b0C\/0.90). 328 \nSimilar observations were made in other studies, in which low production of aflatoxin 329 \nwas observed, despite the fact that the cluster genes were actively transcribed 330 \n(Georgianna and Payne, 2009). 331 \n 332 \nO\u00b4Brian et al. (2007) recently used a microarray analysis to study the influence 333 \nof temperature on expression of the aflatoxin biosynthesis genes. They found a 334 \nreduced expression and no production at 37\u00b0C for th eir strain. However, a strong 335 \ninduction of the genes occurred at 28\u00b0C which was p aralleled by high aflatoxin 336 \nbiosynthesis. Most of their data fits very nicely to the data presented here. Also in the 337 \ncurrent analysis a high production between 25 and 30 \u00b0C could be seen. At 338 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n \n14 \n \ntemperatures beyond or at 37 \u00b0C very scarce amounts  of aflatoxin were produced. 339 \nHowever differences were observed for the expression of the aflatoxin cluster genes. 340 \nO\u00b4Brian et al. (2007) found a high level of expression at optimal production 341 \ntemperature (28 \u00b0C) and a low level at 37 \u00b0C. Durin g this analysis only a basal level 342 \nof expression was found between 25 and 30 \u00b0C as lon g as the water activity was 343 \nabove 0.90, but an induced level at temperatures above 37 \u00b0C. In the current study 344 \nthe fungus were incubated on solid YES medium for 7 days. In the study of O\u2019Brian et 345 \nal. (2007) A. flavus was grown in liquid A & M medium for 7 days which might 346 \naccount for these differences. Moreover the water activity was not controlled in the 347 \nformer study. 348 \n 349 \nO\u2019Brian et al. (2007) observed a difference between the level of aflR and aflS 350 \nexpression and aflatoxin biosynthesis. They found that both regulatory genes were 351 \nhighly expressed at 37\u00b0C, conditions under which th e strain of A. flavus produced no 352 \naflatoxin. The present study also found a strong expression of the aflS gene at 353 \ntemperatures >37\u00b0C at nearly all a w values tested. Despite this high activation of the 354 \naflS gene, low amounts of aflatoxin were produced under these conditions, which is 355 \nsupported by the data of O,Brian et al. (2007). A slight increased expression of the 356 \naflS gene was also found at certain moderate parameter combinations at 30, 25 and 357 \n20 \u00b0C where the cluster is expressed at the basal l evel. Interestingly, at all these 358 \ncombinations, high amounts of aflatoxin were produced when the aflS expression 359 \nwas elevated. At temperatures <37 \u00b0C, when a w leads to cluster gene activation (at 360 \n0.90 aw) no enhanced expression of the aflS was observed, paralleled by a low 361 \nbiosynthesis of aflatoxin. These results indicate that the increased activation of this 362 \nregulatory gene is inhibited by low aw levels. No increased aflR expression could be 363 \nobserved under the current conditions, which however was shown by O\u00b4Brain et al 364 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n \n15 \n \n(2007). Instead the aflR expression paralleled the general cluster gene expression. 365 \nInterestingly the ratio of expression of aflS:aflR is high when high amounts of 366 \naflatoxin are produced, except at temperatures above 37 \u00b0C where the ratio is still 367 \nhigh, but only scarce amounts of toxin are produced. The expression ratio however is 368 \nlow at water activities of 0.90 when only minor amounts of toxin are produced. The 369 \nfact that under certain conditions only low amounts of aflatoxin were produced might 370 \nbe due to an unknown post-transcriptional mechanism as discussed above.  371 \nTwo groups of cluster genes could be identified based on plotting of the 372 \nexpression profile of the single genes against temperature and aw. Interestingly, 373 \nwhen these groups were allocated to the cluster, they suggest a division into three 374 \nhomogenous parts of the cluster consisting of genes of the same group. Genes with 375 \nexpression profile 2 are located within the cluster region between aflF and aflA 376 \nfollowed by a region completely covered by genes of the expression profile 1 (aflR to 377 \naflN) again followed by group 2 genes from aflG to aflY. It has long been observed 378 \nthat the physical order of the genes is similar to the order of enzyme reactions 379 \ncatalysed by their gene products (Trail et al., 1995; Roze et al., 2007). This 380 \norganization seems to be reflected here, dividing the cluster into early, middle and 381 \nlate genes based on the expression profile. Based on these results it seems that the 382 \nmiddle genes may be regulated differently compared to the early and late groups of 383 \ngenes. The only exception is the aflU gene, which lies in the group of early genes, 384 \nbut has the same expression profile as group 1. According to Ehrlich et al. (2004) this 385 \ngene is important in A. parasiticus for the biosynthesis of the G type aflatoxins and 386 \nthis gene together with the aflF gene is often non-functional in A. flavus due to 387 \ndeletions. In a recent publication Carbone et al. (2007) showed that the aflatoxin 388 \ncluster of A. parasiticus is comprised of 5 distinct recombination blocks which seem 389 \nto play a role in the evolution of the cluster. Interestingly block 2 and 3 of the analysis 390 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n \n16 \n \nof Carbone et al. (2007) contains the same genes as group 1 of the current analysis 391 \nof A. flavus. This suggests that also the cluster of A. flavus consist of evolutionary 392 \nbuilding blocks and that the blocks determine differential expression in relation to 393 \nenvironmental parameters. 394 \n 395 \nThe results described here demonstrate activity of the aflatoxin gene cluster 396 \nover the whole range of analysed abiotic factors. It appears that at the basal level of 397 \nexpression, high amounts of aflatoxin are produced. Under mild stress conditions 398 \n(20 \u00b0C\/0.99) a burst of gene induction occurred whi ch at the end resulted in the same 399 \namounts of aflatoxin. This may seem contradictory, however it has to be kept in mind 400 \nthat the aflatoxin production values are accumulated values and the microarray data 401 \nare snapshots of total expression activity over time. Moreover the aflatoxin reaches a 402 \nsaturation level, e. g., the saturation can either be reached due to growth under basal 403 \nlevel expression for a longer time or under high expression levels over a shorter time. 404 \nThis possibility might explain the fact that the amount of aflatoxin produced is the 405 \nsame for both conditions. Additionally regulatory events beyond transcription can 406 \nexplain the facts described here. This possibility is also discussed by Georgianna and 407 \nPayne (2009). 408 \n 409 \nThe influence of aflS seems to be different under various abiotic stress 410 \nconditions. In the case of temperature stress and at moderate temperatures and aw 411 \nlevels aflS is highly expressed when compared to the other cluster genes and high 412 \namounts of aflatoxin are produced if temperature stress is not too high (< 37 \u00b0C). In 413 \nthe case of aw stress aflS expression was not increased over the other genes of the 414 \ncluster and aflatoxin biosynthesis greatly reduced. The ratio between aflS expression 415 \nand general cluster gene expression or aflR seems to be more important for aflatoxin 416 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n \n17 \n \nbiosynthesis than the overall expression level. At temperatures >37\u00b0C this might also 417 \nbe true but a unknown post-transcriptional mechanisms might prevent aflatoxin 418 \nbiosynthesis. 419 \nAgain, in this analysis what was previously shown for ochratoxin A 420 \nbiosynthesis in P. verrucosum, trichothecene biosynthesis in F. culmorum and 421 \naflatoxin biosynthesis in A. parasiticus has been demonstrated now for A. flavus. 422 \nHigh amounts of the toxin are produced at conditions slightly lower than those at 423 \nwhich growth is optimal, but in addition biosynthesis is also activated at the edges of 424 \nthe growth window, when growth is retarded (Schmidt-Heydt et al., 2008).  425 \nFrom a food safety point of view the data can be used to optimize certain food 426 \ntechnological processes, e. g. the drying of susceptible products like for example 427 \nfruits like figs or dates. These products are very often sun dried at temperatures 428 \nbetween 30 \u2013 37 \u00b0C which is inducive for aflatoxin biosynthesis. If the products are 429 \ninstead immediately dried in a heater at temperatures above 37 \u00b0C (repressive for 430 \nochratoxin A biosynthesis) until a water activity of 0.9 is reached (repressive for 431 \nochratoxin biosynthesis) the process should be safe according the data presented 432 \nhere. The water activity of 0.9 is about the water activity of the final product which 433 \ncorresponds to a moisture content of < 25 %. 434 \nThe current study shows that stress applied by external abiotic factors has a 435 \ncomplex influence on aflatoxin gene regulation. This study using a mycotoxin gene 436 \ncluster array gives a first insight into this sophisticated regulatory network.  437 \n 438 \nAcknowledgements 439 \n 440 \nParts of this work were supported by the EU-project \"Development of cost-441 \neffective control and prevention strategies for emerging and future foodborne 442 \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n \n18 \n \npathogenic microorganisms throughout the food chain\" (Pathogen Combat), FOOD-443 \nCT-2005-07081 and by the EU-project \u201cNovel integrated strategies for worldwide 444 \nmycotoxin reduction in the food and feed chains\u201d  (No. 222690).
