INTRODUCTION \nSurfactant molecules have an amphiphilic character and structurally consist of at least \ntwo moieties, a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic component. In water they can exhibit a \nrich phase behavior which may include micelles, rod-like structures, bilayers and cubic \nphases depending on concentration. Just above the limiting monomer solubility (the \ncritical micelle concentration, CMC), surfactant molecules begin to aggregate into \nmicellar structures that are characterized by an inner core comprising the non-polar \nmoieties and an outer interface of polar moieties in contact with the aqueous \nenvironment. The driving force for micelle formation is in general terms understood1-5, \nthe key components being the hydrophobic effect, which excludes the non-polar moieties \nfrom the water to the interior of the micelle structure, and an interfacial free energy \npenalty for the water-micelle interface. These define an energy barrier akin to nucleation \nthat must be surmounted before a micellar cluster can form a stable micelle. There is also \na restraint on the maximum size of the stable micelle, which arises from the loss in \nconfigurational entropy that results from microphase separation. These constraints yield a \nfree energy surface that has a maximum (the barrier that must be surmounted) followed \nby a minimum as a function of cluster size, which explains the observed distribution in \nmicelle size, centered around an average size. The average micelle size is characterized \nby an aggregation number n, the average number of surfactant molecules in a single \nmicelle.    \n Micelle formation has been investigated extensively using a variety of experimental \ntechniques including nuclear magnetic resonance, electron paramagnetic resonance, light \nscattering and small angle neutron diffraction6-7. This effort has been complemented by \n4 \n \nmolecular simulation which yields molecular level resolution, dynamics, and in principle \ncertain thermodynamic quantities. The surfactant models employed in such simulations \nvary from the physics-type models where only the essential features are retained8-9 to \nfully atomistic models based on realistic potentials. Notable simulation studies involving \nrealistic models include micelles of ionic surfactants in an aqueous environment e.g. \nsodium octanoate10-11 and sodium dodecyl sulfate12-13, reverse micelles involving sodium \ndi-2-ethylsulfoccinate (AOT)14, and simulations of micelle self-assembly of \ndodecylphosphocholine15, and sodium dodecyl sulfate16 and of reverse micelles of \nfluorinated polyether in supercritical CO217. Of a particular merit are the recent \ncalculations of free energies of micelle formation from molecular simulation18-19. \nPolysorbate 80 (POE (20) sorbitan monooleate, Tween 80; see Figure 1 for structure) is \na nonionic surfactant with excellent emulsifying and wetting properties. It is an odourless \nand tasteless material, generally regarded as nontoxic and non-irritant, and hence is \nwidely used as an emulsifier, solubiliser and a wetting agent in food, cosmetics, and in \npharmaceutical applications that include drug delivery systems for oral, parenteral and \ntopical delivery20. It is also commonly used in biochemical applications for solubilising \nproteins and cell cultures.  \nThe polysorbate 80 molecule is a multi-headed structure, with four extended \nhydrophilic moieties, one of which has a tagged alkyl chain. It is not obvious, unlike \nlinear surfactants, as to what conformation this molecule adopts either as a monomer or \nwithin a micelle structure in an aqueous environment, how the molecules pack into a \nmicelle, nor the nature of the surfactant-water interface. Knowledge of the micelle \nstructure of this class of surfactant structures is of fundamental interest being required, \n5 \n \nfor instance, for successful applications of molecular-thermodynamic theories,21-22 and is \nimportant for technological applications to enable development and control of \nformulations on a rational basis.  \nHere, we present molecular dynamics simulations of a single polysorbate 80 molecule \nand the self assembly of sixty polysorbate 80 molecules in an aqueous environment, with \na focus on structural and dynamic properties. Molecular simulation of polysorbate 80 \nmicelles presents somewhat of a challenge as the structure of the molecule is relatively \nlarge (214 atoms) with a micelle aggregation number of probably around 60 molecules \n(the published aggregation number varies widely extending over the range 22\u2212350 23\u221227) . \nThese definitions suggest a molecular system size with explicit water molecules of ~ \n100,000 atoms, which whilst doable can challenge laboratory computing facilities. In \nview of this we have opted for a coarse grained approach wherein a number of atomic \nsites are represented by a single particle, which makes this system accessible in terms of \nlength and a timescale albeit compromising some atomic detail. These simulations extend \nthe breadth of micelle simulations with respect to the complexity of the surfactant \nstructure investigated. \n \n2. METHODOLOGY \n2.1. Molecular structure of polysorbate 80  \nThe chemical structure of the polysorbate 80 molecule is not entirely defined. \nPolysorbate 80, along with other polysorbates (e.g. polysorbate 20, 40, 60), is defined as \nbeing composed of fatty acid esters of sorbitol-derived cyclic ethers having \napproximately 20 mols of ethylene oxide per mol of polysorbate 80. However, the \n6 \n \ndistribution of the size of the ethylene oxide groups is not constant and varies from batch \nto batch20. A few attempts have been made to determine the dominant structure for the \nvarious polysorbates using a variety of analytical methods28-31. For polysorbate 60 the \ndominant structure was determined as having chains composed of an almost equal \ndistribution of ethylene oxide groups31. There is no similar study for polysorbate 80, in \nview of which we took the lead from the polysorbate 60 study and considered ethylene \noxide moieties of equal lengths for the polysorbate 80 molecule (see Figure 1). \n \n2.2. Molecular model \nThe coarse-grained model for the polysorbate 80 molecule was based on the MARTINI \nforcefield32, which is typically based on a \u201cfour to one\u201d representation, whereby four \nheavy atoms of the original molecule plus any associated hydrogen atoms are represented \nby a single coarse-grained (CG) particle. Where necessary, three to one and two to one \nrepresentations are also employed33. In this study, it became apparent to us that it was \npossible to map the molecular structure using a three-to-one mapping such that each of \nthe CG particles would be neutral and not be characterized by a partial charge. This \nremoves the need for costly electrostatics calculations within the molecular dynamics \nsimulations, making the simulations considerably more efficient. Thus, each of the three \ngroups \u2013CHn\u2013O\u2013CHn\u2013,  \u2013CHn\u2013CHn\u2013CHn\u2013, and  \u2013CHn\u2013CHn=CHn\u2013 group, where n= 1, 2 \nor 3 (terminal methyl), were represented by a single CG particle, namely COC, C3 and \nC32 respectively from the MARTINI forcefield. The CH2\u2013O\u2013C=O group and CH2\u2013O\u2013H \ngroups were also taken as individual particles being represented by COCO and COH CG \nparticles respectively from the MARTINI forcefield (see Figure 2). For consistency, we \n7 \n \nalso used a three to one mapping for the CG representation of water rather than the \ncommonly employed four to one representation. \nThe masses of the respective CG particles were taken as the sum of the masses of the \natoms represented by the given particle (Table 1).  The CG particles are connected to \neach other by harmonic bonds characterized by the potential function U(r) =0.5k(r-r0)2. \nThe bond parameters were set as prescribed by MARTINI: the equilibrium distance \nr0=4.3\u00c5; the force constant k=12.5 kJmol-1\u00c5-2, with the exception of the ring particle for \nwhich all connecting bonds had the force constant k=50 kJmol-1\u00c5-2. The angles were \ndescribed by the function U(\u03b8)= 0.5k (cos \u03b8 \u2013 cos \u03b80)2  and the equilibrium angles and \nassociated force constants are presented in Table 2. No torsion parameters were \nconsidered. The interaction potential for the MARTINI CG particles is of the Lennard \nJones (LJ) form ULJ(r) = 4\u03b5 [(\u03c3\/r)12 - (\u03c3\/r)6] with no electrostatic interaction. The LJ \ninteraction parameters for the CG particles are given in Table 3. \nThe molecular dynamics simulations were carried out using DLPOLY_2.1934 in the \nNPT ensemble. The temperature and pressure were fixed at 298\u00b0K and 1bar, respectively \nusing Berendsen\u2019s algorithm with both the thermostat and barostat relaxation times set to \n1.0 ps. The cutoff value for van der Waals interactions was 12.0 \u00c5. The timestep \nemployed was 30fs. \nThe single surfactant molecule simulation was carried out in a simulation box \ncontaining 3000 CG water molecules. The self assembly simulation involved 60 \nsurfactant molecules, which is within the experimentally determined range for the \naggregation number for polysorbate 80,23\u221227 in 10000 CG water particles. This \ncorresponded to a concentration of ~0.1M (CMC= 0.012mM). All molecules were \n8 \n \nrandomly placed into the simulation box, avoiding strong repulsive contacts. As \nsuggested by the MARTINI forcefield, the overall time was scaled by a factor of 3 to \nyield the true simulation time which is reported in this paper. The averages and \nassociated uncertainties were calculated using the block averaging technique to minimize \ncorrelation errors. The single polysorbate 80 molecule in water was simulated for 20.0 ns \nof which the first 10 ns was considered as equilibration and the remaining 10 ns for \nextracting averages. The simulation time after scaling the time axis for the self assembly \nsystem was 110 ns, of which the first 10 ns corresponded to equilibration, during which \nthe self assembly of the micelle aggregate took place. The potential energy and the \nvarious structural parameters such as radius of gyration and eccentricity all converged \nrapidly, well within the identified 10ns equilibration period. The remaining trajectory was \nused for extracting the data averages.  \n \n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n3.1 Single polysorbate 80 molecule in water \nA series of snapshots of the surfactant molecule from the single molecule simulation \ntrajectory after equilibration are presented in Figure 3. The average values for the lengths \nof POE chains and the alkyl chain (defined as the distance between the particles \nnumbered 14 and 18, 22 and 26, 27 and 31, and 12 and 8 for the POE chains, and \nparticles 1 and 7 for the alkyl chain) and the radius of gyration are given in Table 4. It \nappears that the molecule samples its entire conformational degrees of freedom and no \nsingle conformation predominates. The individual POE chains spend some of their time \nin an open structure and the remainder coiled up in a globular form. This behavior is \n9 \n \nexpected as the \u2013CH2\u2013O\u2013CH2\u2013 groups and the terminal \u2013CH2\u2013OH have a strong \ninteraction with water and thus tend not to be trapped in a tight structure. The average \nlength of the POE chains and the alkyl chain is lower than their fully extended length, \n14.63 vs 17.2 \u00c5 for POE chains and 18.60 vs. 25.8 \u00c5 for the alkyl chain, thus revealing \non average a degree of compaction for both the hydrophobic and hydrophilic chains. \nFurthermore, it appears that the head POEs are able to stretch more freely compared to \nthe tail POE, the POE chain connected directly to the alkyl chain. \nThe packing parameter P for a molecule is defined by  \ncla\nVP\n0\n=  \nwhere V is the volume of the hydrophobic tail, ao is the headgroup area, and lc is the \nmaximum length of the tail35. The packing parameter is useful in predicting the \ngeometrical properties of aggregates of surfactants36. Thus, spherical, cylindrical, \nvesicular, planar bilayers, or inverted micelle structures are characterized by packing \nparameter values of P < 1\/3,  1\/3 < P < 1\/2, 1\/2 < P < 1, P~1 and P > 1, respectively. For \nthe isolated polysorbate 80 molecule the volume of the hydrophobic tail was given by \nV=(27.4 + 26.9n) \u00c53 for n carbon atoms, and lc = (1.5 + 1.265n) \u00c5. The headgroup area \nao was calculated by projection of the headgroup along the vector between the head group \nand the tail onto the perpendicular plane. The packing parameter was estimated to be \n0.07, predicting a spherical shape for the formed micelles, as one might expect from the \ngross features of the polysorbate 80 molecules notably a very large headgroup and a \nrelatively short tail. \n10 \n \nTo look at the hydration of the molecule more closely, the various CG particles in the \npolysorbate 80 molecule were split into three separate groups, namely, hydrophobic (i.e. \nC32 and C3), hydrophilic (ie. COC and COCO) and terminal polar (i.e. COH). The radial \npair distribution function, g(r), for each of these against water (shown in Figure 4) \nexhibits a shell of hydration. The average number of the water particles within the \nhydration shell (up to the first minimum in the g(r)) for each of the molecular groups \nwere C3 (19.4), C32 (17.7), COCO (22.7), COC (21.9) and COH (32.1). As Figure 4 and \nthe hydration numbers suggest, the hydration around the hydrophobic and hydrophilic \nparts of polysorbate 80 show the expected rank order but is on whole pretty much similar, \nother than the number of water particles around the terminal polar groups being \nconsiderably greater as would be expected. The hydration shell around the core of the \nmolecule is limited relative to other groups possibly because of the limited accessibility \nof this region due to the four moieties branching from the core structure. Clearly the \ncoarse graining removes the sharp distinction in hydration of a hydrophilic and a \nhydrophobic moiety that might be observed at an atomic resolution.  \n \n3.2 Micelle self assembly  \nSnapshots of the micelle self-assembly process are shown in Figure 5. The randomly \npositioned molecules of polysorbate 80 first aggregate into small clusters, which then \ncome together to form a single micelle, the entire process taking about 800ps. All 60 \nmolecules become integrated into the micelle. The micelle then undergoes restructuring \nto yield its final equilibrium arrangement. The resulting micelle shows stability over the \nfull residual trajectory with no indication of breaking up and no tendency for the \n11 \n \nindividual molecules to leave the micelle structure over the simulation period. The \nvariation in potential energy of the system during and after the assembly process is given \nin Figure 6. It shows a sharp fall over the first ~800ps, reflecting the assembly of the \nmonomers, and then only a gradual decrease that corresponds to the restructuring of the \nmicelle.  \n \n3.3. Micelle structure \nWe first focus on the shape and size of the micelle. Figure 7 shows a snapshot of the \nmicelle along with a cross-sectional view from the trajectory. The micelle is compact \nexposing the terminal polar particle at the surface while the alkly chains, as expected, \noccupy the central core. The variation in the radius of gyration (Rg) as a function of \nsimulation time is presented in Figure 8, whilst the average radius of gyration (Rg) and \nthe shape parameters of the micelle are tabulated in Tables 4 and 5, respectively. The \nradius of gyration Rg shows little variation after equilibration, the average value being \n26.2\u00c5. There is no available experimental value to compare against. The physical radius \nof the micelle can estimated from the gyration radius using gm RR 3\n5\n= ,\n37  which yields a \nradius of 33.8 \u00c5. Whilst we have taken the aggregate number of 60 polysorbate 80 \nmolecules for the simulations (the basis being the study of de Campo et al.26) the \nexperimental literature reveals considerable inconsistency, making comparison with \nexperiment difficult. The published aggregation number varies widely extending over the \nrange 22\u2212350 whilst the associated micelle radius ranges 2.1\u22124.05 nm respectively23\u221227.  \n  \n12 \n \nIn characterizing the shape of the micelle we assumed it be ellipsoidal characterized by \nthe three semiaxes, a, b, and c which were calculated from the principal axes of inertia of \nthe micelle I1 > I2 > I3 using  \n)(\n5\n1\n)(\n5\n1\n)(\n5\n1\n22\n3\n22\n2\n22\n1\ncbMI\ncaMI\nbaMI\n+=\n+=\n+=\n \nwhere M is the total mass of the micelle. \nThe eccentricity was calculated using \n2\n2\n1\na\nc\ne \u2212=   \nThe ratio of the average semi-axes is 1.25 : 1.12 : 1.00 indicating that on average the \nshape of the micelle is prolate ellipsoid i.e. like that of a rugby ball. Such a shape has \nbeen reported for micelles of a number of other surfactants (eg.14,38). The eccentricity \n(after equilibration) as a function of time varies over the range 0.45\u22120.75 (Figure 9) \nindicating minor fluctuations in shape.    \nThe average atomic-density profiles computed with respect to the centre of mass of the \nmicelle are given in Figure 10. The effect of the micelle deviating from a spherical shape \nwas ignored; the implication is that the calculated density distributions may be broader \nthan they actually are. The molecular structure of the polysorbate 80 was divided into \nfour distinct groups: the hydrophobic tail consisting of particles numbered 1-6 (i.e. C3 \nand C32), the ring or core part of the molecule comprising particles 19, 20 and 21, the \n13 \n \nterminal polar particles (COH) numbered 18, 26 and 31, and the hydrophilic part \ncomprising the remaining molecule (i.e. COC and COCO particles). \nWe note that the water density begins to decrease from the bulk value of  ~970 kg\/m3 \n(which is similar to the experimental value) as we move into the micelle. Water \nmolecules are able to penetrate the micelle up to about 18 \u00c5 from the centre of the \nmicelle whilst the hydrophobic moieties of the polysorbate 80 molecule can extend \noutwards to about 26 \u00c5 from the centre. Thus we have an inner hydrophobic core of \nabout 22 \u00c5 with a buffer zone of about \u00b1 4 \u00c5. Whilst the water molecules, the ring \nstructure, and the terminal polar groups of the POE chains are restricted to being outside \nthe hydrophobic core, there appears to be considerable overlap between the hydrophilic \nPOE chains and the alkyl chains, covering a region from about 12 to 26 \u00c5. The density of \nthe hydrophobic core is about 800 kg\/m3 which is slightly higher than the experimental \ndensity value of 785 kg\/m3 for pure 1-heptadecene39, suggesting well packed liquid-like \nstructure. The outer layer of the micelle is dominated by the terminal polar groups of the \nPOE chains due to strong interactions between these particles and the water. Analysing \nthe total density reveals a peak region where the density is higher than that of the bulk \nwater and the micelle interior and is thought to arise from the high density central ring \nstructure of the molecule. The density distribution also enables the estimation of the \nmicelle radius. Taking the peak to peak distance between the opposing polar terminal \nparticles yields a micelle radius of about 35 \u00c5 which is close the value of about 34 \u00c5 \nobtained from the radius of gyration. In summary, as expected, the hydrophobic tail \noccupies the inner core of the micelle while the terminal polar groups of the POE chains \nform a shell around the micelle, with the ring component being located within the centre \n14 \n \nof the headgroup. There does not appear to be any significant void space within the \nmicelle.  \nWe also characterised the surface topology, in particular the extent of openness of the \nmicelle surface by calculating the surface accessible area using a spherical probe with a \nradius of 4.3 \u00c5 i.e. the van der Waals radius of the CG particles. The solvent accessible \narea was calculated using VMD version 1.86 and was determined to be 15528 \u00c52. The \nsurface area of a smooth ellipsoid of the same size as the micelle calculated using  \nppppppp cacbbaS\n\/1\n3\n4 \uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb ++\n= pi  \nwith p=1.6075,40 is 14212 \u00c52.  The accessible surface area is higher as one might \nexpect but not by that much given the probe molecule is a coarse-grained particle. A \nvisual view of the micelle surface reveals it to be rather compact and non-porous (see \nFigure 7).  \n \n3.4 Structure of the polysorbate 80 molecule within the micelle \nA particularly important question is what is the average molecular conformation of the \nmolecule in the micelle, the average here being defined as spatial over all molecules in \nthe micelle, and temporal over the entire trajectory after equilibration. To this end \ndistributions of characteristic distances, angles, and a particular torsion were calculated \nand are presented in Figures 11-13 respectively. The distributions of the vector lengths of \nthe POE chains all essentially superimpose, being relatively sharply peaked at about 15 \u00c5 \nwith variation over the range 10-18 \u00c5. This suggests that these chains are rather bent \nyielding a compact head group. The alkyl chain vector length is characterised by a \n15 \n \nslightly broader distribution peaking at about 20 \u00c5, whilst the end-to-end vector length \nfor the combined POE and alkyl chain shows a very broad distribution ranging from 10 to \n40 \u00c5. The latter clearly shows that the tail part of the molecule samples a large amount of \nconformational space within the micelle and that there is no strong preference for it to \nbeing straight. Indeed this is confirmed by the distribution of the angle defined by the \natoms (18,13,8) which is  indicative of how bent are the combined POE and alkyl tails \n(Figure 12). This angle shows a wide distribution ranging from 50 to 180\u00b0, peaking at \nabout 140\u00b0. A straight tail would yield an angle of 180\u00b0. The angle distributions in Figure \n12 also reveal that the tails do not in general point to the centre of the micelle. The angle \ndefined by the vector linking core atom 13 to the terminal alkyl atom 1 (i.e. the combined \nPOE and alkyl tail) and the vector from atom 13 to the centre of mass of the micelle \nshows a rather sharp peak at about 25\u00b0, suggesting a significant misalignment from the \nmicelle centre. An angle of zero would mean that the tails point towards the micelle \ncentre. The polysorbate 80 structure has a number of torsions around the core ring \nstructure that define the rotation of the POE chains relative to each other, an important \none being the torsion angle between either of the POE chains defined by atoms 21\u221226 or \n20\u221231 and the POE chains defined by atoms 13\u221218 or 13\u22128. The distributions of these \ntorsions were calculated and that defined by atoms (28,20,13,15) is given in Figure 13. \nThese distributions suggest some preference for two of the POE chains, atoms 27\u221231 and \n22\u221226, to form a V-like structure, the centre of which is perpendicular to the other two \nPOE chains (atoms 14\u221218 and 8\u221212) that form an almost linear backbone (see Figure \n14). \n16 \n \nWe also determined the averaged conformation of the molecule within the micelle, \naveraging over all molecules within the micelle and over the entire trajectory after \nequilibration. Taking one of the molecules from the first configuration of the trajectory as \na basis, the other molecules were superimposed onto this molecule using the rigid-body \nKabsch algorithm41. This algorithm superimposes either the centres of mass or the \ncoordinates of a selected atom of two molecular structures (conformations) and then \ncalculates the optimal rotation matrix that minimizes the root mean squared deviation \n(rmsd) between identical atoms in the two molecular conformations. Superpositions \nbased on one of the atoms representing the core ring structure (atom 19), rather than the \ncentre of mass, were found to give lower rmsds and hence are reported here. The \nremarkable, cactus-like \u2018average\u2019 structure of the polysorbate 80 molecule alongside a \ncomposition of all superposed conformations is given in Figure 14. The average structure \nreveals an almost linear backbone comprising a POE chain linked to the alkyl tail, and \ntwo short arms corresponding to the other two POE chains. The three POE chains with \npolar terminal groups all point away from the centre of the micelle, exposing the polar \nterminal groups to the solvent. These POE chains along with the alkyl tail are \nconsiderable shortened, with the CG particles showing extensive overlap that in energetic \nterms would be, were it to be a real effect, wholly unfavorable. This shortening and the \nparticle overlaps are essentially artifacts of the averaging. The actual molecules sample \nall kinds of conformations where the chains are either slightly bent or coiled but because \nthese conformations are distributed evenly (by definition) about the mean coordinates, the \nmean coordinates reflect a projection of the actual coordinates. Hence, it becomes clear \n17 \n \nthat the average structure as determined is not a real conformation in which the molecule \nspends its predominant time. \nThe \u2018composition\u2019 of the superposed conformations of the polysorbate 80  molecules \nwithin the micelle in Figure 14 provides an alternative perspective. This clearly reveals \nthat the molecules sample their conformational space as well as the local physical volume \nwithin the micelle rather uniformly. Again it may be tempting to suggest that this is the \ntextbook pinhead representation of the polysorbate 80 molecule. This would be \nmisleading. The composite structure could represent the physical volume sampled by a \nsingle polysorbate 80 molecule and this in itself would be true. However, it does not \nrepresent the excluded volume between two interacting molecules within a micelle. \nWithin the micelle, there is much accommodation and cooperation between the molecules \nto yield a compact structure. \nThe packing parameter of the surfactant molecules was also computed after \nequilibration based on the equations given in Section 3.1. The headgroup area for the \npolysorbate molecule in the micelle was estimated from the separation distance between \nrespective core (the central ring) regions of the molecules. The packing parameter of the \npolysorbate 80 in the micelle was estimated to be 0.12, which as expected is a little larger \nthan the value of 0.07 calculated for the free molecule in water, reflecting the constraints \non the headgroups from neighbouring molecules within the micelle. \n \n3.5 Dynamics \nThe diffusion constants for the free molecule and the micelle were calculated from the \nmean squared displacement of the centre of mass of the molecule or micelle using the \n18 \n \nEinstein relationship trd 62\u2206= , where 2r\u2206  is the average mean squared \ndisplacement over the time period t. The lateral diffusion of the polysorbate molecule on \nthe spherical surface of the micelle was calculated by removing contributions of the \ncentre of mass displacement as well as the rotation of the micelle and projecting the \nresulting displacement of the individual molecules onto the spherical surface, i.e. onto the \nperpendicular plane defined by the outward vector from the centre of the micelle. Lateral \ndiffusion being 2-dimensional was calculated using the relationship trd 42\u2206= . The \ndiffusion constant for the free molecule in water was estimated to be 1.8 x 10-6 cm2\/s, \nwhich is remarkably close to the corresponding experimental value of 1.9 x 10-6 cm2\/s \nobtained using pulsed field gradient spin echo NMR42. The calculated diffusion constant \nfor the micelle was 1.8 x10-7 cm2\/s which compares well with the experimental estimate \nof 3.0 x10-7 cm2\/s42, making the self-diffusion of the free molecule about 10-fold faster. \nThe lateral means squared displacement of the individual molecules on the spherical \nsurface of the micelle revealed diffusional behavior rather than reaching a plateau, \nconfirming that the micelle structure is not lattice-like. The calculated lateral diffusion of \nthe individual surfactant molecules was 1.7 x10-7 cm2\/s, that is, about the same as that of \nthe micelle. \n \n4. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION \nThe POE sorbitan esters are a rather complex class of surfactants comprising multiple \nchains that are highly flexible. The structure of these molecules in their free state in water \nand that of the micelle aggregates that they form has been outstanding for some time. We \n19 \n \nhave carried out molecular dynamics simulations of polysorbate 80 as a single free \nmolecule as well as the self-assembly of a micelle comprising 60 (the known micelle \naggregation number) polysorbate molecules in water, and characterized both structural \naspects and dynamics. For efficiency we opted for a coarse grained model representation \nof the molecule \u2212 the polysorbate 80 molecule contains 214 atoms and makes the overall \nsystem size rather large. The relatively decent reproduction of the experimental data \nsuggests that the loss of specificity is not an issue; indeed this was expected as there are \nno strong, specific interactions that could be compromised in going to a coarse grained \nrepresentation. In its free state in water, the polysorbate molecule samples its almost \nentire conformational space, with the alkyl tail at times being completely exposed to the \nwater environment. As would be expected, its estimated packing parameter (0.07) in the \nfree molecule state suggests a very large effective headgroup and a relatively short tail.   \nThe simulations reveal that the self-assembly of a micelle of polysorbate 80 from \nrandomly dispersed molecules is extremely fast, occurring within a nanosecond of \nsimulation time. The resulting micelle is stable for the entire trajectory lasting 110 ns. \nThe micelle structure is compact with the surface being dominated by the polar terminal \ngroupds of the POE chains, and exhibits a prolate ellipsoid shape that shows minor \nfluctuations. The average radius of gyration was 26.2 \u00c5 whilst the physical radius was \nabout 35 \u00c5. The hydrophobic core of the micelle is densely packed with a density slightly \nhigher than that of a medium chain liquid alkane. Within the micelle, the \u2018average\u2019 \nstructure of the polysorbate 80 is best described as cactus-like with the polar terminal \ngroups of 3 of the POE chains all bidding to be at the water interface. The molecule, \nwhile constrained within the micelle structure, is anything but rigid and samples almost \n20 \n \nits entire conformational space. The estimated diffusion constants for the free molecule \n(1.8 x 10-6 cm2\/s) and the micelle (1.8 x10-7 cm2\/s) were found to be remarkably close to \nthe respective experimental values. The lateral diffusion of the molecules on the micelle \nsurface was about the same as that of the micelle structure. These structural and \ndynamical insights set the foundation for exploring the next stage of complexity \nconcerning these surfactants, namely emulsification and in particular nanoemulsions43,44 \nthat serve as drug delivery carriers for pharmaceutically-active hydrophobic molecules \nthat are challenging to deliver by other means.   \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nThe study has been supported by Tehran University of Medical Sciences & Health \nServices grant number 88-01-87-8624. \n \nREFERENCES \n1.
