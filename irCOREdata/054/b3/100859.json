Self-consistent axially-deformed Hartree-Fock calculations, using a\nseparable monopole interaction, of nuclei in the vicinity of 190W are performed to systematically examine the\nevolution of ground state quadrupole deformations. It is found that the neutron number N = 116 causes a\ncoexistence of oblate and prolate shapes, with a weak dependence on proton number, thereby hindering the\ndevelopment of these isotones as well-deformed rotors.\nDOI: 10.1103\/PhysRevC.72.047303 PACS number(s): 21.10.Pc, 21.60.Jz, 27.70.+q, 27.80.+w\nIt is well known that nuclei with one or more magic numbers\nare spherical in the ground state, and as one increases or\ndecreases the number of protons or neutrons and moves to open\nshells, ground state deformation occurs. From a mean-field\npoint of view, shape changes arise due to deformed single\nparticle levels being energetically favored for incomplete\nj-shells. In the shell model, deformation occurs due to\nconfiguration mixing. In the interacting boson approximation\n(IBA), different nuclear shapes are described in terms of group\ntheory, whereby axial prolate and oblate deformations, and\nspherical shapes can be described as realizations of different\nmathematical groups [1]. In the IBA, one can think of the\ncontrol parameter related to the number of nucleons to be\nvaried continuously, and can therefore refer to shape changes\nas a phase transition [2]. All these theoretical descriptions of\nnuclei, to the extent that they are correct, must be different,\nand complementary, ways of describing the same underlying\nphysics.\nMapping the changes in the ground state shapes of nuclei\nis interesting because it helps illuminate these underlying\ntheories. The shape of a nucleus also has a pronounced\neffect on its low-lying energy spectrum, and predictions of\nshape are valuable in interpreting data. For example, the\nratio of energies of the first 4+ excited state in an even-even\nnucleus to the energy of the first 2+ state tends to 3.33 for a\nwell-deformed rotational nucleus, and to 2.0 for a vibrational\nnucleus. Motivated by recent determination of the identities\nof low-lying states, and hence this ratio in 190W [3], and the\nprospects for forthcoming investigations of this mass region\nusing radioactive isotope facilities, this paper studies, from\na mean-field point of view, the evolution of ground state\nshape properties of nuclei in the region around 190W. This\npart of the nuclear chart is particularly interesting, since it\nis, amongst heavy nuclei, the only place where one is several\nproton and neutron holes outside a doubly magic nucleus.\nJust below magic numbers, the energetics of low-\u0001 orbitals\nleads to small regions where oblate states may dominate at\nlow spins, in contrast to the usual prolate dominance over\nmost of the nuclear chart [4]. The experiment which reached\n190W [3] is in the process of being followed up by further\nstudies with projectile fragmentation reactions, allowing this\noblate-dominant region to be studied in detail for the first time.\nFigure 1 shows a summary of the lowest 4+ to 2+ energy\nratio for nuclei in this region, where data are known [3,5]. The\nanalysis of these empirical low-lying energy levels in 190W\nshowed that whereas for the isotones N = 114 and lighter the\nE(4+1 )\/E(2+1 ) ratio increases smoothly, tending towards 3.33\nas Z decreases from Z = 78 to Z = 70, for N = 116 there is\na decrease in this ratio between Z = 76(Os) and Z = 74 (W).\nThe similarity of this result to the consequences of the\nbreakdown of theZ = 64 subshell gap forN < 78 andN > 88\nsuggested that the 190W result might be due to shell effects,\nparticularly an already posited Z = 76 subshell appearance\n[6], or equivalently, that a shape change occurs due to the shell\neffects [3].\nNuclei in this region, and specifically 190W have been\nthe subject of previous theoretical investigation. The early\nIBA study of Duval and Barret [7] concentrated on\nthe structure of lighter tungsten isotopes, and does not\nsuggest an anomalous E(4+)\/E(2+) ratio in 190W. The\npairing+quadrupole calculations of Kumar and Baranger [8]\nplaced the shape change for osmium and platinum at lower\nneutron number, but did not extend tungsten calculations\nto N = 116. Recent mean field based calculations of Naik\net al. [9], in which relativistic and nonrelativistic calculations\nwith angular momentum projections were performed, mapped\nout signatures of collective behavior in this region as a function\nof N and Z. Though there were some differences in the\nresults between the different models and parameters in their\nstudy, they did not conclude that 190W was different in nature\nto nearby nuclei. Woods-Saxon\u2013based calculations [10] have\nsuggested the prolate-oblate shape change takes place between\nN = 114 and N = 116, with similar calculations suggesting\nN = 118 [11].\nIn the present work, an analysis is made of the systematics\nof nuclei in the region of 190W using a separable monopole\ninteraction [12]. This interaction was designed to be amenable\nto the addition of correlations in perturbation theory, giving\nsmall corrections to the mean-field result. At the level of one-\nbody observables it has been demonstrated that corrections\nbeyond the mean field are particularly small [13]. This gives\nus some confidence that our particular mean-field approach\nmay be able to give a qualitative description of the nuclei\nin question, if we concentrate on one-body observables such\n0556-2813\/2005\/72(4)\/047303(4)\/$23.00 047303-1 \u00a92005 The American Physical Society\nBRIEF REPORTS PHYSICAL REVIEW C 72, 047303 (2005)\n 2.4\n 2.5\n 2.6\n 2.7\n 2.8\n 2.9\n 3\n 3.1\n 3.2\n 3.3\n 3.4\n 70  72  74  76  78\nE(\n4+\n)\/E\n(2+\n)\nZ\nN=108\nN=110\nN=112\nN=114\nN=116\nN=118\nN=120\nFIG. 1.

Deformation at minima (upper panel) for isotones in\nthe region of 190W, the absolute difference between the minimum\nenergy and the opposite shape minimum for the range of nuclides\nwith the separable monopole interaction (central panel), and a\ncomparison between the separable interaction (SMO) and a Skyrme\nparametrization (SkI4) for the case of N = 116 (lower panel).\ndata on 190W, a triaxial Woods-Saxon mean field calculation\nof the potential energy surface was performed [3], allowing for\nboth \u03b2 and \u03b3 degrees of freedom. In their case a barrier of the\norder a few hundred keV was found in the \u03b3 direction, though\nthis barrier was rather smaller than in the \u03b2 direction. We may\nconsider in the following discussion that the softness in the \u03b3\ndegree of freedom is comparable or greater than that in \u03b2, and\nqualitatively account for triaxial effects in the interpretation of\nany coexisting axial minima found.\nThe potential energies of the above nuclides as a funciton\nof \u03b2 deformation are shown in Fig. 2. One can see that as one\napproaches either the N = 126, towards the top of Fig. 2, or the\nZ = 82 shell closure, towards the right of Fig. 2, the potential\nenergy surfaces soften and the absolute \u03b2 values of the minima\ndecrease, as expected. In the center of the plot is 190W, which\nappears to have two minima of rather equal depth separated\nby a barrier of about 4 MeV. Assuming that this nucleus is\nindeed rather soft in the \u03b3 direction, the equality of the depth\nof the oblate and prolate minima suggestes that 190W could be\nan ideal candidate for an O(6) nucleus, from an IBA point of\nview [2].\nTo partially account for the softness in the \u03b3 direction,\nthe constrained Hartree-Fock calculations which give rise\nto the potential energy surfaces are presented in a different\nway in Fig. 3. The upper part of the figure shows the\ndeformation of the intrinsic ground state as predicted by\nthe Hartree-Fock calculations. Following Ref. [3], isotonic\nlines are plotted for the series of even-even isotopes around\ntungsten. The suggestion from this plot is that for Z = 78, the\ncloseness to the Z = 82 magic number is enough to ensure\nthat all the Pt isotopes are oblate, but as one considers lower\natomic numbers, away from the closed shell, the isotones split\ninto those which have well-deformed prolate ground states\n(N = 110, 112, 114), and those whose neutron number is close\nenough to the N = 126 magic number to keep the ground state\noblate (N = 118, 120, 122). The N = 116 isotones, appear to\nalternate between producing oblate and prolate ground states.\nThe central panel of Fig. 3 helps interpret the meaning of\nthese ground state deformations. It shows the difference in\nenergies between the ground state, be it oblate or prolate,\nand the next minimum in the potential energy surface, which\nis of the opposite shape. It shows that as one decreases Z\naway from the spherical Z = 82 shell closure, the ground\nstate deformation becomes increasingly rigid and well defined\nfor most of the isotonic chains. The exception is N = 116, in\nwhich the oblate and prolate minima continue to compete, as\nindicated by the small difference in energy between the two\nconfigurations. This leads one to conclude that the alternating\nN = 116 line in the upper plot of Fig. 3 is due not to a definite\nalternating of shape, but to a lack of a definite rigid shape in\nthe ground state of the N = 116 isotones. The fact that the\nmore well-defined shapes are separated by the N = 116 line\nsuggests that the oblate-prolate shape change in this region\nis a neutron-driven effect. In the lower part of Fig. 3, a\ncomparison is made between the separable monopole force\ncalculations for the N = 116 isotones and a well-established\nSkyrme parametrization, SkI4 [15], to check that the presented\nresults are not an anomaly of the choice of force. A good\nagreement is seen for the energy differences, with SkI4 also\nexhibiting a strong shape coexistence for all the N = 116\nisotones. A somewhat larger value of the energy difference\nbetween oblate and prolate minima is seen in 188Hf in SkI4,\nyet it is still rather small, compared to the calculations for\nother hafnium isotopes, as seen in the central panel. The\nexperimental determination of the low-lying spectrum of this\nisotope will be useful in differentiating between effective\ninteractions. So far, only the ground state has been observed ex-\nperimentally, following production in projectile fragmentation\nreactions [16].\nThe inclusion of ground state correlations is unlikely to\nqualitatively affect the results for those nuclei whose oblate-\nprolate energy difference is large. However, it may change\nthe staggering in the N = 116 isotones, since the oblate-\nprolate difference is so small, and this point should reinforce\nthe above statement that, around 190W, the N = 116 isotones\nare not well-deformed rigid nuclei. The low E(4+)\/E(2+)\nratio is then not surprising. The calculations performed with\nthe separable monopole interaction, and presented here, further\nsuggest that the effect will continue for 188Hf, and perhaps to\nlighter isotones.\nIn conclusion, constrained Hartree-Fock calculations for\na series of even-even nuclei around 190W have been\n047303-3\nBRIEF REPORTS PHYSICAL REVIEW C 72, 047303 (2005)\nperformed, showing that the N = 116 isotones do not have\na well-defined axially-deformed shape as Z decreases around\ntungsten. The apparent anomaly in the systematics of the ratio\nof the first 4+ and 2+ energies in 190W is therefore explained by\nit not being a rigid axial rotor, unlike lighter tungsten isotopes.\nThis trend is expected to continue at least to the next even-even\nN = 116 isotone, 188Hf.\nThis work was supported by the U.K. EPSRC and by U.S.\nDOE Grant No. DE-FG02-94ER40834.
