Until \nnow, research into industry dynamics has addressed this issue by focusing almost exclusively on \nthe contribution of firm entry and exit to resource reallocation, that is, whether newly created \nfirms or plants are more productive than the dying firms and plants they replace.1 This paper \nexamines a new, \u201cextensive\u201d margin of firm adjustment, the reassignment of resources that takes \nplace within surviving firms as they add and drop (i.e., \u201cswitch\u201d) products.\nOur analysis of product switching makes use of a unique longitudinal dataset that tracks US \nfirms\u2019 product-level manufacturing output across quinquennial US Manufacturing Censuses \nfrom 1987 to 1997. In this dataset, a \u201cproduct\u201d is one of approximately 1,500 five-digit Standard \nIndustrial Classification (SIC) categories, e.g., \u201cPassenger Cars.\u201d 2 We observe the set of prod-\nucts each manufacturing firm produces in each census year and analyze how incumbent firms\u2019 \nmix of products evolves from one census year to the next.

Krizan (2001), Foster, Haltiwanger, and Chad Syverson (2008), and Esteban Rossi-Hansberg and Mark J. \nWright (2007) among others.\n2 We refer to two-, four- and five-digit SIC categories as \u201csectors,\u201d \u201cindustries,\u201d and \u201cproducts,\u201d respectively.\nMultiple-Product Firms and Product Switching\nBy Andrew B. Bernard, Stephen J. Redding, and Peter K. Schott*\nThis paper examines the frequency, pervasiveness, and determinants of prod-\nuct switching by US manufacturing firms. We find that one-half of firms alter \ntheir mix of five-digit SIC products every five years, that product switching is \ncorrelated with both firm- and firm-product attributes, and that product adding \nand dropping induce large changes in firm scope. The behavior we observe is \nconsistent with a natural generalization of existing theories of industry dynam-\nics that incorporates endogenous product selection within firms. Our findings \nsuggest that product switching contributes to a reallocation of resources within \nfirms toward their most efficient use.

Standard manufacturing cen-\nsuses, for example, typically record just the primary industry of each establishment.3\nWe find product switching to be frequent, widespread, and influential in determining both \naggregate and firm outcomes. On average, recently added and about-to-be dropped products \neach account for roughly one-sixth of a product\u2019s output, amounts that rival the shares repre-\nsented by recently created and about-to-exit firms. At the firm level, we find that more than \none-half of US manufacturing firms alter their mix of products between censuses, and that \none-half of those firms change their mix of products by both adding and dropping at least one \nproduct every five years. Product adding and dropping also exert considerable influence on the \nscope of firms, with an average of 40 percent of firms adding products outside their existing \nset of four-digit SIC industries between census years. Given the unobserved changes firms \npresumably make to their product mix at lower levels of aggregation, our estimates of product \nswitching likely underestimate the true importance of firms\u2019 adjustments to their extensive \nmargins.4\nOur empirical analysis is guided by a model of endogenous product selection that builds \non existing theories of industry dynamics by Boyan Jovanovic (1982); Hugo A. Hopenhayn \n(1992); Richard Ericson and Ariel Pakes (1995); Marc J. Melitz (2003); and Bernard, Redding, \nand Schott (2007).5 In these existing models, firms that are heterogeneous in productivity are \nassumed to produce a single product, with the result that firm and product-market entry and \nexit are equivalent. Here, we develop a natural extension of such models in which firms choose \nto produce an endogenous range of products in response to evolving firm and firm-product \ncharacteristics.6 In our model, firms differ in innate productivity while firms\u2019 products vary \nin their attractiveness to consumers vis-\u00e0-vis other producers of the same product. The overall \nprofitability of a firm depends on the interaction of these attributes. Higher values of consumer \ntastes for a firm\u2019s product raise the firm\u2019s profitability in that product, while higher values of \nfirm productivity increase a firm\u2019s profitability in all products. In equilibrium, the most pro-\nductive firms manufacture the largest ranges of products because they earn greater revenue per \nproduct for given values of consumer tastes, and can therefore cover the fixed costs of a wider \nset of products.\nOur framework provides a basis for understanding many of the empirical regularities dis-\ncernible in US census data. In the data, we find that multiple-product firms have higher mea-\nsured revenue-based productivity than single-product firms. In the model, this difference is due \nto high-productivity firms\u2019 ability to cover the fixed costs of a greater number of products. In \nthe data, we find product switching and firm creation and destruction to be commonplace and \n3 Existing empirical work on multiple-product firms typically examines product diversification at a point in time. \nSee, for example, Frank M. Gollop and James L. Monahan (1991) and John Baldwin and Wulong Gu (2009). Dunne \net al. (1988, 1989b) examine product diversification as a mode of market entry distinct from plant birth, while Dunne, \nShawn D. Klimek, and Roberts (2005) investigate the empirical relationship between the mode of market entry and \nplant death.\n4 One of the attractions of our data is that information is available for the entire manufacturing sector. Scanner data, \nsuch as those used by Judith A. Chevalier, Anil K. Kashyap, and Peter E. Rossi (2003) and Christian Broda and David \nE. Weinstein (2007), offer the potential to measure products at finer levels of disaggregation, although they are typically \navailable only for specific categories of goods.\n5 These models receive empirical support from studies of firm creation and destruction by Baily et al. (1992), Dunne \net al. (1989a, b) and Foster et al. (2001, 2008).\n6 Existing theoretical research on multiple-product firms focuses on issues associated with managing a given range \nof products at a particular point in time, e.g., William J. Baumol (1977); John C. Panzar and Robert D. Willig (1977); \nJames A. Brander and Jonathan Eaton (1984); Avner Shaked and John Sutton (1990); and B. Curtis Eaton and Nicolas \nSchmitt (1994). More recently, Tor Jakob Klette and Samuel Kortum (2004); Erzo G. J. Luttmer (2008); and Satyajit \nChatterjee and Rossi-Hansberg (2008) have explored the role of innovation in determining firm scope, as discussed \nfurther below.\nmARCh 201072 ThE AmERICAN ECONOmIC REVIEW\npervasive across sectors. In the model, interactions of stochastic shocks to firm productivity and \nstochastic shocks to consumer tastes foster steady-state product adding and dropping, as well as \nsteady-state firm creation and destruction. In the data, we observe a positive correlation between \nproducts\u2019 add and drop rates. In the model, this correlation arises because firms that receive \npositive demand shocks add the product at the same time that some incumbent producers draw-\ning negative demand shocks drop it. In the data we find that the probability that a firm drops a \nproduct declines with firm-product shipments and firm-product tenure. In the model, this scale \nand age dependence arises as a result of serial correlation in idiosyncratic shocks to firm-product \nprofitability. Firms\u2019 lower-volume and recently added products are more likely to be dropped as \na result of a negative shock.\nOur results also emphasize the central role of the firm in mediating product adding and drop-\nping. In the data, we find that product adding is positively correlated with firms\u2019 measured \nrevenue productivity, and that product dropping is influenced by firm as well as firm-product \nattributes. In the model, decisions to add or drop products are interdependent, given the contribu-\ntion of the firm-level productivity draw to the profitability of all of a firm\u2019s products. We also find \nproduct switching to be related to firm outcomes, with net adding and net dropping of products \nbeing positively and negatively correlated with measured revenue productivity, respectively. In \nthe model, such contemporaneous responses are driven by shocks to productivity: firms receiv-\ning positive shocks earn greater revenue per existing product and expand, while firms receiving \nnegative shocks contract.\nThough our model serves as a useful guide for our empirical analysis, in its current form it is \ntoo stylized to provide an explanation for all of the facts that we uncover. We find, for example, \nthat some pairs of products are more likely to be coproduced within firms than others, and that \nmergers and acquisitions account for a relatively small share of the number of products added \nand dropped, but a larger share of their value. While these facts transcend our basic setup, we \ndescribe how the model might be extended to incorporate them.\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Sections I and II outline our theoretical \nframework and describe our dataset. Sections III and IV report our main empirical findings and \ntheir consistency with our theoretical framework. Section V concludes, with suggestions for \nfuture research.\nI.\u2002 Theoretical\u2002Framework\nIn this section we outline a simple model of multiple-product firms and product switching that \nis a natural extension of standard models of industry dynamics by Jovanovic (1982), Hopenhayn \n(1992), Ericson and Pakes (1995), Melitz (2003), and Bernard, Redding, and Schott (2007). Our \ngoal is to introduce the simplest model necessary for useful data analysis, i.e., one that captures \nthe essence of a broad class of models featuring product selection. Toward that end, we employ a \nnumber of simplifying assumptions, for example, ruling out supply- or demand-driven comple-\nmentarities across products. We return to a discussion of how the model might be generalized, \nand discuss alternative potential approaches after presenting our main empirical findings.

Incurring the sunk entry cost creates a firm brand and a blueprint for one horizontally \ndifferentiated variety of every product. Only once the sunk cost has been incurred does the \nfirm observe its initial productivity, \u03c6\u200a\u2208\u200a[  __ \u03c6,  __\u200a\u03c6  ], and consumer tastes for the characteristics \nembodied in its blueprint for every product, \u03bbi \u2208\u200a[\u200a __ \u03bb,  __\u200a\u03bb  ]. Productivity \u03c6 is firm-specific but is \ncommon across products within firms, whereas consumer tastes \u03bbi are firm-product specific and \nare therefore idiosyncratic to a particular product made by a particular firm.9\nProductivity and consumer tastes evolve stochastically over time and we choose a specifica-\ntion for their evolution that is both tractable and sufficiently general to match key features of the \nfirm-product data.10 Upon entry, productivity and consumer tastes are drawn from the continu-\nous distributions ge(\u03c6) and z ei(\u03bbi ), respectively, with cumulative distributions ge(\u03c6) and Zei(\u03bbi ). \nOnce a firm observes its initial values of productivity and consumer tastes, it decides whether \n8 One interpretation of the parameter \u03bbi(\u03c9) is product quality, though this parameter also captures other more sub-\njective characteristics of a firm\u2019s variety that influence consumer tastes.\n9 With CES demand and monopolistic competition, differences in productivity across firms have identical effects \non equilibrium revenue and profits to differences in consumer tastes. While we have modeled the component of prof-\nitability that is firm-product specific (\u03bbi ) as consumer tastes, we could have equivalently introduced a productivity \nparameter that is firm-product specific. While consumer tastes are a plausible source of idiosyncratic shocks to firm-\nproduct profitability, the important point for our analysis is that the profitability of a product for a firm has both a firm \nand a firm-product component.\n10 Bernard, Redding, and Schott (2006) introduce a static model of multiproduct firms without equilibrium product \nswitching to examine the impact of trade liberalization on firms\u2019 product scope.\nmARCh 201074 ThE AmERICAN ECONOmIC REVIEW\nto produce or exit. If the firm exits, its production knowledge is lost, and the sunk cost must be \nincurred again in order for the firm to reenter. If the firm enters, it faces a Poisson probability \u03b8\u200a\n>\u200a0 of a shock to productivity \u03c6, in which case a new value for productivity \u03c6\u2032 is drawn from the \ncontinuous conditional distribution gc(\u03c6\u2032 | \u03c6), with cumulative distribution gc(\u03c6\u2032 | \u03c6). Similarly, \nthe firm faces a Poisson probability \u03b5i\u200a>\u200a0 of an idiosyncratic shock to consumer tastes for its \nvariety \u03bbi , in which case a new value for consumer tastes \u03bbi\u2032 is drawn from a continuous condi-\ntional distribution z ci(\u03bbi\u2032 | \u03bbi), with cumulative distribution Zci(\u03bbi\u2032 | \u03bbi).11\nConsistent with the serial correlation in firm and firm-product shipments observed in our data, \nwe assume that consumer tastes and productivity are positively serially correlated, which cor-\nresponds to the following assumption about their conditional distributions: \u2202Zci(\u03bbi\u2032 | \u03bbi)\/\u2202\u03bbi\u200a<\u200a0 \nand \u2202gc(\u03c6\u2032 | \u03c6)\/\u2202\u03c6\u200a<\u200a0 for \u03bbi\u2032\u200a\u2208\u200a[\u200a __ \u03bb\u200a,  __\u200a\u03bb  ] and \u03c6\u2032\u200a\u2208\u200a[\u200a __ \u03c6,  __\u200a\u03c6  ]. Thus the probability of drawing a \nnew value for consumer tastes (productivity) less than \u03bbi\u2032 (\u03c6\u2032 ) is decreasing in the existing \nvalue of consumer tastes (productivity). To make use of law of large numbers results, we assume \nthat the distributions of consumer tastes and productivity are independent across firms. For the \nsame reason, we also assume that the distributions of consumer tastes are independent across \nproducts and that the distributions of consumer tastes and firm productivity are independent of \none  another.12 Firms also face a Poisson probability of death \u03b4\u200a>\u200a0 due to force majeure events \nunrelated to profitability.\nThe production technology takes the following form. There is a fixed corporate headquarters \ncost of  fh\u200a>\u200a0 units of labor, which the firm must incur irrespective of the number of products \nthat it chooses to produce, and a fixed production cost of  fpi\u200a>\u200a0 units of labor for each product \ni that is produced. In addition, there is a constant marginal cost for each product, which depends \non the firm\u2019s productivity. Total labor employed by a firm with productivity \u03c6 is thus\n(3) l (\u03c6)\u200a=\u200a\u200afh\u200a+\u200a \u222b 0 \n1\n   Ii c\u200afpi\u200a+\u200a\u200a qi (\u03c6, \u03bbi)\u200a______\u03c6\u200a  \u200ad\u200bdi,\nwhere Ii is an indicator variable that equals one if a firm produces product i and zero otherwise, \nand q(\u03c6, \u03bbi) denotes output of product i by a firm with productivity \u03c6 and demand \u03bbi.\nC. Equilibrium Entry and production decisions\nThe key economic decisions of a firm in the model are whether to enter or exit and in which \nproduct markets to participate. We begin by considering the decision of whether to participate \nin a product market. If a firm produces a product, it supplies one of a continuum of varieties \neach with measure zero relative to the product market as whole. As this is true for each of the \ncontinuum of products, the firm\u2019s profit maximization problem reduces to choosing the price of \neach product variety separately to maximize the profits derived from that product variety. This \noptimization problem yields the standard result that the equilibrium price of a product variety is \na constant mark-up over marginal cost:\n(4) pi(\u03c6, \u03bbi)\u200a=\u200a\u200a 1 __\u200a\u03c1\u200a  w __\u200a\u03c6\u200a ,\n11 While the model could be extended to allow firms to make endogenous investments in improving productivity \nand enhancing consumer tastes, these extensions are not central to the model\u2019s key predictions, which are driven by \nselection, and so we do not pursue them here.\n12 While the consumer taste and firm productivity distributions are independent of one another, there is interde-\npendence in a firm\u2019s profitability across products, because firm productivity is common across products. In Section IV \nbelow, we discuss extending the model to introduce other forms of interdependence.\nVOL. 100 NO. 1 75BERNARd ET AL.: mULTIpLE-pROdUCT fIRmS ANd pROdUCT SWITChINg\nwhere we choose the wage for the numeraire and so w\u200a=\u200a1.\nUnder our assumption of CES preferences, equilibrium prices are inversely related to firm \nproductivity. As \u03c6 rises, variable labor input and output rise, but prices fall, leaving revenue per \nvariable input unchanged. Nevertheless, the model features dispersion in revenue-based mea-\nsures of productivity across firms, as examined in our empirical analysis below, because of the \nassumption of fixed production costs. As \u03c6 rises, variable labor input and revenue increase, with \nthe result that the fixed labor input is spread over more units of revenue.13\nAs there is a fixed production cost for each product, there exists a zero-profit consumer taste \ncutoff\u2002\u03bb*i\u200a(\u03c6) such that a firm with productivity \u03c6 will produce product i only if it draws a con-\nsumer taste greater than or equal to \u03bb*i\u200a(\u03c6). The zero-profit consumer taste cutoff is defined as \nfollows:\n(5)\u200a \u03c0i(\u03c6, \u03bb*i\u200a(\u03c6))\u200a=\u200a  Ri(\u200a\u03c1pi  \u03c6\u03bb\n*\ni\u200a(\u03c6) ) \u03c3\u22121   _____________\u200a\u03c3\u200a  \u2212\u200a fpi =\u200a 0,\nwhere \u03c0i(\u03c6, \u03bbi) denotes equilibrium profits from a variety of product i with consumer taste \u03bbi and \nfirm productivity \u03c6.\nFrom equation (5), the higher a firm\u2019s productivity \u03c6, the lower is the zero-profit cutoff for con-\nsumer tastes \u03bb*i\u200a(\u03c6), and so the greater the probability of having a value for consumer tastes suf-\nficiently high to profitably produce the product. With a continuum of products and independent \ndistributions for consumer tastes, the law of large numbers implies that the fraction of products \nproduced by a firm equals the sum of its probabilities of producing each product. Therefore, as \nthe probability of producing each product is increasing in firm productivity, a key implication of \nthe model is that a firm\u2019s product range is increasing in its productivity.\nWe now consider a firm\u2019s decision of whether to enter or exit. With a continuum of products \nand independent distributions for consumer tastes, a firm\u2019s expected profits across the continuum \nof products equals the sum of its expected profits from each product minus the fixed head-\nquarters costs:\n(6)\u200a \u03c0\u200a(\u03c6)\u200a=\u200a  \u222b \n0\n \n1\n   c\u200b\u222b \u03bb*i\u200a(\u03c6) \n \n__\u200a\u03bb  \n \u200a \u03c0i(\u03c6, \u03bbi )\u03b3zi(\u03bbi )\u200a\u200ad\u03bbi d\u200adi \u2212 fh,\nwhere \u03b3z i (\u03bbi ) is the stationary distribution for consumer tastes, which, as discussed further in the \nWeb Technical Appendix, is endogenously determined as a function of the entry and conditional \ndistributions, z ei(\u03bbi ) and z ci(\u03bbi ), respectively.\nAlthough consumer tastes for a firm\u2019s variety of a product are stochastic, the law of large num-\nbers implies that all firms with the same productivity experience the same flow of total profits \nacross the continuum of products in equation (6). Stochastic shocks to consumer tastes generate \nfluctuations in the profitability of individual products, which lead them to be added and dropped \nover time. However, these fluctuations in the profitability of individual products average out at \nthe level of the firm, so that the evolution of total firm profits over time is determined solely by \nstochastic shocks to firm productivity.\n13 We follow Foster, Haltiwanger, and Syverson (2008) in differentiating between revenue- and quantity-based mea-\nsures of productivity. As we show in the Web Technical Appendix, both measures are monotonically related to the firm \nproductivity draw (\u03c6) in the model. We note that a monotonic relationship between \u03c6 and revenue-based measures of \nproductivity can also be achieved via a demand system with a variable elasticity of substitution, such as the quasi-linear \npreferences of Melitz and Gianmarco I. P. Ottaviano (2008).

As \ntotal firm profits across the continuum of products \u03c0\u200a(\u03c6) are increasing in \u03c6\u200a, and the probability \nof experiencing a productivity shock that induces exit gc(\u03c6* | \u03c6) is decreasing in \u03c6\u200a, the value of \nthe firm in equation (7) is increasing in its productivity.

As shown in the Web Technical Appendix, these six variables and functions are determined \nby the following equilibrium conditions: consumer and producer optimization, goods and labor \nmarket clearing, free entry, the zero-profit cutoff condition for consumer tastes for each product, \nthe equality of the mass of successful entrants and the mass of exiting firms, the equality of the \noutflow and inflow of firms from each value of consumer tastes, and finally the equality of the \noutflow and inflow of firms from each value of productivity.\nThe general equilibrium of the model features both steady-state product switching and steady-\nstate firm entry and exit. Each period a measure of new firms incur the sunk entry cost, and \nthose with productivity draws above the zero-value cutoff enter, while those with productivity \ndraws below the zero-value cutoff exit. A surviving firm with unchanged productivity produces \na constant range of products, but idiosyncratic shocks to consumer tastes for individual prod-\nucts induce surviving firms to drop a measure of the products previously produced and add an \nequal measure of products not previously produced. As stochastic shocks to a surviving firm\u2019s \nproductivity occur, the range of products produced expands with an increase in productivity and \ncontracts with a decrease in productivity.

Before beginning that analysis, we describe our data.\nII.\u2002 Data\u2002Description\nAs part of its quinquennial Census of Manufactures (CMF), the US Census Bureau (hereafter \n\u201cCensus\u201d) collects information on the set of Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) categories \nproduced by US manufacturing establishments (i.e., \u201cplants\u201d). This information is obtained from \nquestionnaires plants are required to fill out by law under Title 13 of the United States Code. \nEach questionnaire has two parts. The first is common to all establishments and solicits general \ninformation about their operation, including their overall shipments (i.e., \u201coutput\u201d), use of inputs \n(capital, production and nonproduction workers, and materials) and wagebills.14 We use this \ninformation to examine differences between single- and multiple-product firms, and, along with \nindustry price deflators provided by Eric J. Bartelsman, Randy A. Becker, and Wayne B. Gray \n(2000), to compute revenue-based measures of firms\u2019 labor and total factor productivity (TFP).15 \nAs noted in Section IC and discussed further in the Web Technical Appendix, both revenue- and \nquantity-based measures of productivity are monotonically related to the firm productivity draw \n(\u03c6) in the model.16\nThe second part of each questionnaire varies depending on the industry in which the establish-\nment operates. It lists the set of products that establishments in the industry typically produce, as \nwell as a verbal description of each product.17 Establishments are instructed to record their total \nshipments of each product.18 In the event that an establishment also ships products not listed on \nthe form, the questionnaire provides space for them to record any shipments in additional prod-\nuct codes. Establishments are assigned to industries according to information collected from \nprevious censuses as well as other census surveys. Very large plants with substantial activity in a \nnumber of industries may receive more than one form. Very small plants, referred to as \u201cadmin-\nistrative records,\u201d are not required to report output at the product level. These establishments \nrepresent a very small share of overall US manufacturing output and are typically ignored in US \nmicrodata research; we drop them here as well.\n14 CMF questionnaires define shipment value as goods\u2019 \u201cnet selling value f.o.b. plant to the customer after discounts \nand allowances,\u201d and excluding freight charges and excise taxes. Questionnaires used as part of the 1997 CMF are \navailable at www.census.gov\/epcd\/www\/econ97.html. All dollar-value data collected in the CMF are nominal.\n15 We measure firm TFP as the shipment-weighted average TFP of its plants. Plant TFP in a given census year is \nmeasured relative to other plants in its main industry in percentage terms using the multifactor superlative index num-\nber of Douglas W. Caves, Laurits R. Christensen, and W. Erwin Diewert (1982). This index accounts for plants\u2019 use of \ncapital, production workers, nonproduction workers, and materials. Plant shipments, capital, and materials are deflated \naccording to the four-digit SIC deflator of its major industry using deflators provided by Bartelsman et al. (2000). Wages \nare deflated by regional US consumer price indexes available at www.bls.gov. A plant\u2019s main industry is the four-digit \nSIC in which it has the largest value of shipments.\n16 We focus on revenue-based measures of productivity because data on physical units of output are not available \nfor all products and because physical units of output are not comparable across firms for many products, e.g., cars. We \nnote that Foster, Haltiwanger, and Syverson (2008) find a positive correlation between revenue- and quantity-based \nmeasures of productivity for a sample of 11 products for which it is possible to compute and compare both measures \nacross firms.\n17 Questionnaires also collect information on establishments\u2019 \u201cother\u201d activities, such as \u201ctasks performed for oth-\ners using others\u2019 materials,\u201d which cannot be associated with a particular manufacturing product. We exclude these \ncategories from our analysis.\n18 We note that the census does not collect information on firms\u2019 input use by product, and also that output defla-\ntors for five-digit SIC products are not available. As a result, measurement of establishments\u2019 use of inputs or revenue \nproductivity within individual products is not possible.\nmARCh 201078 ThE AmERICAN ECONOmIC REVIEW\nWe analyze product switching in the 1987 through 1997 censuses. We use a five-digit SIC \ncategory as our definition of a product and refer to two- and four-digit SIC categories as \u201csec-\ntors\u201d and \u201cindustries,\u201d respectively.19 As described in United States Department of Commerce \n(1989), manufacturing encompasses 20 sectors, 455 industries, and 1,440 products. As product-\nmix decisions are made at the level of the firm, we aggregate plants to firms to create a firm by \nproduct by census year dataset.20 Using this dataset we track the products that firms add and drop \nacross census years.21 Given that a considerable body of research already examines firm creation \nand destruction, we focus on the features of product switching by surviving firms highlighted by \nour model. In particular, we neither treat exiting firms as those that drop all their products, nor \nentering firms as those that add all their products. For convenience, we often refer to firms that \nproduce multiple products as \u201cMP firms\u201d and firms that produce a single product as \u201cSP firms.\u201d\nTo provide a sense of the relative level of detail between sectors, industries, and products, \nconsider \u201cNonferrous Wiredrawing and Insulating\u201d (SIC 3357), which is one industry inside the \n\u201cPrimary Metal Industries\u201d (SIC 33) sector. The 13 products in this industry range from copper \nwire (SIC 33571) to fiber optic cable (SIC 33579), and are listed in Table A1 of the Web Technical \nAppendix. Though these products share a grossly similar end use, they can differ substantially in \nterms of the materials and technologies required to manufacture them.\nFor the manufacturing sector as a whole, the typical two-digit sector has 24 four-digit indus-\ntries and 76 five-digit products, as reported in Table A2 of the Web Technical Appendix. The \nnumber of products per sector ranges from a low of 12 in Leather (SIC 31) to a high of 178 in \nIndustrial Machinery (SIC 35). Similarly, the average number of products per industry within \nsectors ranges from a low of 1.1 in Leather to a high of 5.1 in Printing and Publishing (SIC 27).22 \nNonferrous Wiredrawing and Insulating (SIC 3357), the industry highlighted above, is just one \nof 26 Primary Metal Industries, and its products represent 14 percent (13\/90) of the total number \nof products in that sector. Products vary substantially in terms of how they are produced both \nwithin and across sectors, as shown in the last four columns of Table A2, which report the mean \nand standard deviation of products\u2019 1997 capital and skill intensity by sector.23\nWe interpret the SIC categories used to record US manufacturing output as discrete partitions \nof the model\u2019s continuum of products, which become coarser as one increases the level of aggre-\ngation. With this interpretation, the model provides a natural explanation for the coexistence of \nsingle- and multiple-product firms. We think of firms producing a single product as those whose \n19 Output at the five-digit SIC level is the most disaggregate data available for all plants. While CMF questionnaires \nsolicit information at the seven-digit SIC level, establishments also surveyed for other programs (e.g., Census Current \nIndustry Reports) are permitted to report information at the five-digit level to alleviate their reporting burden.\n20 Firm identifiers are derived from firms\u2019 legal identities, and firms can consist of one or many establishments. \nCensus uses an annual Company Organization Survey both to determine how new firms are organized and to keep \ntrack of changes in incumbent firms\u2019 ownership structure over time, e.g., the buying and selling of plants, the creation \nof new plants, or the closing of existing plants.\n21 SIC categories undergo minor revisions in each census year but experienced a major revision in 1987. Census uses \nan internally generated concordance to map product codes collected in censuses after 1972 to the 1987 revision. We \nfocus on the 1987 to 1997 censuses because they are less sensitive to this concordance and exhibit high product-code \nconsistency over time. To be conservative, we drop the roughly 1 percent of five-digit codes (representing roughly 5 \npercent of total value) that do not appear in all three censuses. We note that our findings are not sensitive to this proce-\ndure, and that we find (but do not report) similar results for other sample periods, e.g., the 1972 to 1982 censuses, where \nthe concordance of collected and 1987-revision product codes is less precise.\n22 There is substantial variation in the precision of industry and product classifications. For example, Passenger Cars \n(SIC 37111) and Combat Vehicles (SIC 37114) are examples of products in the Motor Vehicle industry (SIC 3711), while \nTextbook Binding and Printing (SIC 27323) and Religious Books, Binding and Printing (SIC 27323) are examples of \nproducts in the Book Printing industry (SIC 2732).\n23 As the CMF does not collect information on input usage (or wages) by product, we measure a product\u2019s capital \nand skill intensity as the shipment-weighted average of all plants producing it.\nVOL. 100 NO. 1 79BERNARd ET AL.: mULTIpLE-pROdUCT fIRmS ANd pROdUCT SWITChINg\nrange of products falls within a single five-digit  category. MP firms, on the other hand, are those \nwhose product range is wide enough to span several five-digit SIC categories.\nTable 1 reports an average breakdown of SP and MP firms across the 1987 to 1997 census \nyears in our sample, and also reports the average number of products, industries, and sectors MP \nfirms produce. As indicated in the table, MP firms dominate: though they represent a minority \nof firms (39 percent), they account for a strong majority of shipments (87 percent). Multiple-\nindustry and multiple-sector firms are similarly influential, responsible for 28 and 10 percent of \nfirms but 81 and 66 percent of output, respectively. The final column of Table 1 reveals that the \naverage MP firm produces 3.5 products, that the average multiple-industry firm manufactures in \n2.8 industries, and that the average multiple-sector firm is present in 2.3 sectors.24\nIII.\u2002 Empirical\u2002Evidence\nOur model highlights a number of features of product switching that operate at the level of \nfirms, products, and firm-products. We organize our empirical investigation of product switch-\ning in this section according to these levels of analysis. We note that the formal derivation of the \nmodel\u2019s implications is available in the Web Technical Appendix.\nA. firm-Level Evidence\nIn the model, firms with higher productivity produce a wider range of products than firms \nwith lower productivity because their higher revenues per product allow them to cover the fixed \ncosts of a larger measure of products. Idiosyncratic shocks to firm-product profitability drive \nsteady-state adding and dropping of products within firms, while idiosyncratic shocks to firm \nproductivity induce changes in the measure of goods firms produce.\nThe Relative productivity of multiple-product firms.\u2014Table 2 compares the characteristics \nof single- and multiple-product firms in the 1997 census, though we note that results are similar \nin previous census years. The table reports the results of OLS regressions of the natural log of \n24 On average across the census years 1987 to 1997, the share of MP firms with a single plant is 84 percent compared \nto a share of 93 percent for all firms. Therefore, MP firms are more likely to operate several production facilities than \nSP firms, but multiple products are frequently produced within the same production facility.\nTable 1\u2014Prevalence of Firms Producing Multiple Products, Industries  \nand Sectors in 1997\nType of firm\nPercent of\nfirms\nPercent of\noutput\nMean products, industries, \nor sectors per firm\nMultiple product 39 87 3.5\nMultiple-industry 28 81 2.8\nMultiple-sector 10 66 2.3\nNotes: The table categorizes firms according to whether they produce multiple products (five-\ndigit SIC categories), industries (four-digit SIC categories), or sectors (two-digit SIC catego-\nries).

As indicated in the table, MP firms are larger \nthan SP firms in the same industry in terms of both shipments (0.66 log points) and employment \n(0.58 log points). We also find that MP firms have higher revenue-based labor and TFP than SP \nfirms in the same industry.\nSimilar differences are found with respect to firms producing in multiple industries and in \nmultiple sectors, except for the TFP differential between single- and multiple-sector firms. That \ndifference is statistically indistinguishable from zero, perhaps due to the difficulties of measur-\ning productivity in firms with disparate products that span two-digit sectors.25 All remaining \ndifferences displayed in the table are statistically significant at the 1 percent level.\nWhile our analysis is based on US census data, we note that other datasets are amenable to \nanalyzing firms\u2019 product scope at various levels of aggregation. The publicly available Amadeus \ndatabase published by Bureau Van Dijk, for example, contains information on EU firms\u2019 primary \nand secondary industries. We note that differences among single- and multiple-industry firms \nin those data are similar to the results reported in the second column of Table 2. Unfortunately, \nthe manner in which Amadeus tracks changes in firms\u2019 industries over time makes it difficult to \nundertake comparisons of product-mix dynamics across US and EU firms.\nproduct Switching within firms.\u2014We examine product switching by dividing surviving firms \ninto four exhaustive and mutually exclusive groups based on the manner in which they alter their \nmix of products between census years. Possible actions are: (i) None\u2014the firm does not change \nits mix of products; (ii) drop\u2014the firm only drops products; (iii) Add\u2014the firm only adds prod-\nucts; and (iv) Both\u2014the firm both adds and drops products, i.e., \u201cchurns\u201d products.\nTable 3 reports firm activity across these dimensions for the pooled 1987 to 1997 censuses. \nCells in panel A of the table report the average percent of firms reporting each activity across \n25 Our model implies that measurement of TFP for multiple-product firms is problematic if, as is the case here, data \non inputs at the firm-product level are unavailable.

Comparing the results \nfor all firms in the first column with those for MP firms in the second column, we find implicitly \nthat SP firms are more likely to leave their product mix unchanged than MP firms. From the \nthird column of the table, we find that exporters are more likely to change their product mix \nthan nonexporters. Finally, from the remaining columns of the table, we see that large firms and \nmultiple-plant firms also have above-average rates of product switching.27\nThe frequency and pervasiveness of product switching displayed in panel A of Table 3 is \nconsistent with our model. In panel B of the table we report output-weighted results, which \nreveal that firms accounting for relatively large shares of output are more likely to add and drop \nproducts than smaller firms across columns. This behavior is also understandable in light of our \ntheoretical framework, as more productive firms are more likely to have product ranges wide \nenough to span five-digit SIC categories, rendering them more likely to add and drop products. \nSince more productive firms in the model also produce more of each product and have larger \n26 Though the figures reported in the table correspond to the probabilities of product switching conditional on firm \nsurvival, it is straightforward to evaluate the unconditional probabilities of product switching for all firms by multiply-\ning the figures in the table by the average probability of firm survival, which is roughly two-thirds.\n27 Results for SP firms, nonexporters, \u201csmall\u201d firms, and single-plant firms are available upon request. An alternate \ndecomposition of activity according to whether firms do not change their product mix, change their mix but do not net \nadd or drop any products, change their product mix and net add products, or change their product mix and net drop \nproducts indicates that these actions on average occur 46, 12, 22, and 20 percent of the time, respectively, across census \nyears.\nTable 3\u2014Product Switching by US Manufacturing Firms, 1987 to 1997\nFirm activity\nAll\nfirms\nMulti-product \nfirms Exporters\nLarge\nfirms\nMulti-plant\nfirms\npanel A. percent of firms\nNone 46 20 38 39 25\nDrop product(s) only 15 12 18 17 21\nAdd product(s) only 14 32 14 16 15\nBoth add and drop 25 36 31 28 38\npanel B.

The regression coefficients therefore capture the cor-\nrelation between changes in the net number of products and changes in firm characteristics \nconditional on firm survival. Each row of the table reports results for a different firm-outcome \n28 The left out category encompasses firms that undertake no product switching or, if they do switch products, \nexperience no net change in the number of products they produce. Similar results are obtained if an additional dummy \nvariable is included for firms that engage in product switching but experience no net change in products. Though our \nregression focuses on net adding and dropping because these relate most closely to the predictions of the model, we \nnote that an analogous specification using the Add, Drop and Both measures defined above also reveals statistically \nsignificant correlations between product switching and changes in measured firm characteristics.\n29 Results for nominal output and nominal output per worker are similar. Due to the unavailability of product-level \nprice indexes, firms\u2019 product-level shipments are deflated by their corresponding industry-level deflators. The inclusion \nof product-mix-by-year fixed effects in the regression helps to alleviate concerns about product-year variation in prices.\nTable 4\u2014Product Switching and Changes in Firm Characteristics, 1987 to 1997\nNet drop Net add Observations R2\nLog change in real output \u22120.078*** 0.096*** 94,012 0.05\n(0.0093) (0.0076)\nLog change in employment \u22120.085*** 0.078*** 94,012 0.03\n(0.0100) (0.0075)\nLog change in real output\/worker 0.007** 0.018*** 94,012 0.03\n(0.0038) (0.0043)\nChange in TFP \u22120.041*** 0.031*** 94,012 0.08\n(0.0070) (0.0076)\nNotes: Table summarizes OLS regression results of log change in firm characteristics over five-year intervals accord-\ning to whether firms net add or net drop products.

Similarly, we find that net product dropping is associated with a decrease in firm \nsize and TFP. Although the correlation between net product dropping and revenue-based labor \nproductivity is positive rather than negative, the estimated coefficient is roughly an order of \nmagnitude smaller than those for the other variables. As noted above, the structure of our model \nimplies that measuring the productivity of multiple-product firms is problematic when data on \ninputs are unavailable at the firm-product level.\nWhile the regression results in Table 4 establish that product switching is accompanied by \nchanges in observed firm characteristics, we emphasize that they are correlations capturing an \nequilibrium relationship between endogenous variables. As product choice is endogenous, the \nregression coefficients capture both the nonrandom decision to change the net number of prod-\nucts and the impact of this decision on observed firm characteristics.\npotential product-Category mismeasurement.\u2014Census devotes considerable resources to the \naccurate collection and verification of establishments\u2019 product-shipment data. As noted above, \nforms are designed to minimize measurement error by being tailored to the industry in which \nestablishments operate, by listing the SIC categories (and descriptions) that establishments in the \nindustry commonly produce, and by offering establishments space to record output in unlisted \ncategories. After forms are collected, Census verifies the consistency of current responses with \npast responses and recontacts establishments whose data appear erroneous. Nevertheless, our \nanalysis of product switching is susceptible to establishments\u2019 inaccurate transcription of SIC \ncodes.\nWe believe our results to be robust to product-category mismeasurement for several reasons. \nFirst, we note that our use of five-digit SIC categories to define products requires only that firms \ncorrectly record the first five digits of the seven-digit SIC categories listed on the census ques-\ntionnaire. Second, we find little evidence of spurious product switching in the data: less than \n2 percent of firms across the 1987 to 1997 censuses, for example, are observed producing, not \nproducing, and again producing the same product. Third, the results reported in Table 4 indi-\ncate correlations between product-switching behavior and separately recorded measures of firm \ncharacteristics such as size and input usage that are systematic and consistent with our model. \nThe consistency of these and other empirical results with the predictions of the model is hard to \nsquare with simple explanations of mismeasurement based on classical measurement error.\nFourth, we note that we observe similar switching behavior with respect to even more easily \nidentified four-digit SIC industries and two-digit SIC sectors. Table 5 compares firms\u2019 extensive-\nmargin adjustments for products (column 1 reproduced from Table 3), industries (column 2), and \nsectors (column 3) using the same typology of activities as in Table 3. The first row of the table \nrecords the average share of firms making no adjustments between census years. Not surpris-\ningly, product switching (54 percent) is more likely than industry switching (41 percent), and \nindustry switching is more prevalent than sector switching (16 percent). Even so, product add-\ning induces an average of 27 percent of firms to enter at least one new industry and 9 percent of \nfirms to break into at least one new sector every five years. To the extent that adding industries \nand sectors requires adopting unfamiliar production and distribution technologies, these findings \nalso suggest that firms\u2019 extensive-margin adjustments involve considerable changes in the nature \nand scope of firms.\nmARCh 201084 ThE AmERICAN ECONOmIC REVIEW\nAs a final check, we examine how product switching varies depending on the main two-digit \nmanufacturing sector of a firm. We find that the average percent of firms that alter their mix of \nproducts every five years varies from a low of 33 percent in Stone and Concrete (SIC 32) to a high \nof 71 percent in Printing and Publishing (SIC 27), as reported in Table A3 in the Web Technical \nAppendix. Product switching therefore appears to be a pervasive feature of the US manufactur-\ning sector that is not driven by behavior in a few influential sectors.\nB. product-Level Evidence\nIn the model, there is a positive correlation between products\u2019 add and drop rates: while some \nfirms not producing a product receive a positive demand shock and therefore add it, some of the \nincumbent producers receive a negative demand shock and hence drop it. Variation in product \nadd and drop rates is governed by the probability of receiving a shock. \u201cTurbulent\u201d product \nmarkets, where idiosyncratic shocks are more likely, exhibit more frequent adding and dropping, \nother things equal, than \u201cstable\u201d products where shocks are less prevalent. A related feature of \nproduct switching at the product level concerns gross versus net changes in product output. As \nidiosyncratic shocks lead different sets of firms to add and drop the same product simultane-\nously, the model has gross changes in product output dominating net changes.\nproduct Add versus drop Rates.\u2014Figure 1 displays the mean rate at which five-digit SIC \nproducts are added and dropped by US manufacturing firms across the 1987 to 1997 censuses. A \nproduct\u2019s add rate in year t is computed as the number of firms adding the product between cen-\nsus years t\u200a\u2212\u200a5 and t divided by the average number of firms producing the product in both years. \nDrop rates are computed analogously. As shown in the figure, there is a clear positive  correlation \nbetween the rates at which products are added and dropped. This correlation is statistically sig-\nnificant at conventional levels.30\nThe positive correlation between the rates at which US manufacturing products are added \nand dropped indicates that the extensive-margin adjustments we observe in the data cannot be \nexplained solely in terms of a net reallocation of economic activity from one group of products to \nanother. Such a net reallocation would imply a negative correlation between the rates of product \nadding and dropping, as growing products are frequently added and infrequently dropped, and \ndeclining products are frequently dropped and infrequently added. Although the fact that add \n30 Existing research on plant creation and destruction finds a positive correlation between plant entry and exit rates. \nSee, for example, Dunne et al.

Indeed, \nin the model, net reallocation within products occurs because some firms add a product as other \nfirms drop it.\nproduct Switching and Aggregate Output.\u2014Our model points to product switching as a new \ndimension of resource reallocation that complements the more widely studied margin of plant or \nfirm entry and exit. To assess the relative importance of this new dimension at the product and \naggregate level, we decompose a product\u2019s output according to the type of firm producing it. In \nour first decomposition, we look backward in time to divide product output in year t according \nto firms that produce the product in both t and t\u200a\u2212\u200a5 (\u201cincumbents\u201d), surviving firms that do not \nproduce the product in t\u200a\u2212\u200a5 but do produce it in t (\u201cadders\u201d), and firms that do not exist in t\u200a\u2212\u200a5 \nbut produce the product in t (\u201centering firms\u201d),\n(10) Ytp\u200a=\u200a \u2211\u200a\nj\u2208Bt p\n\u200a  \u200a Yt  p j\u200a+\u200a \u2211\u200a\nj\u2208At  p\n\u200a  \u200a Yt p j\u200a+\u200a \u2211\u200a\nj\u2208Nt p\n\u200a  \u200a Yt p j ,\n31 In the model, a turbulent product with a high probability of idiosyncratic shocks to demand not only has high \nrates of product adding and product dropping but also displays a high volatility of shipments at firms that continue to \nproduce it. Consistent with this implication, we find a positive correlation in the data between a product\u2019s rate of adding \nor dropping and its mean standard deviation of log shipments over time at firms that continue to produce the product.\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\nA\nd\nd \nra\nte\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3\nDrop rate\nFigure 1.

First, because they are based on the nominal value of output in year t, they do not require \n product-level price deflators. Second, they can be converted into percentage decompositions for \neach product by dividing through by Ypt. As a result, they do not require comparisons of output \nvalue across products and so avoid the problems associated with such comparisons.\nPanel A of Table 6 reports the mean product-value decompositions in percentage terms across \nall products. Each row of the panel reports the average decomposition for a particular census \nyear, with the first three columns looking backward (adding versus entering) and the final three \ncolumns looking forward (dropping versus exiting). In both cases we find that roughly two-thirds \nof the average product\u2019s output is produced by incumbents. The remaining output is more or less \nevenly split between firms adding or dropping the product and entering or exiting firms. In 1992, \nthe only year of the sample for which both decompositions can be performed, adders and entrants \nare responsible for an average of 14 and 19 percent of products\u2019 output, respectively, while drop-\npers and exiters account for 15 and 18 percent, respectively.\nIn panel B of Table 6, we report the results of a similar decomposition for the share of firms \nproducing a product in a census year. While incumbents again make the greatest single contribu-\ntion, their average share of firms, at 40 to 45 percent, is lower than their average share of output. \nOf the remaining 55 to 60 percent of producers, 29 to 37 percent are entering or exiting firms and \n23 to 27 percent are adders or droppers. In Table A3 in the Web Technical Appendix, we report \nthe results of these decompositions by two-digit sector. While there is some variation across sec-\ntors, we find substantial contributions of roughly equal magnitude from adders and droppers and \nentering and exiting firms in each two-digit manufacturing sector.\nThe breakdowns reported in Table 6 also highlight the fact that gross changes in product out-\nput are substantially larger than the associated net changes, an \u201cexcess reallocation\u201d that is simi-\nlar in spirit to the one found in job creation and destruction by Stephen J. Davis and Haltiwanger \n(1992). Indeed, comparison of the forward-looking 1992 decomposition with the backward-look-\ning 1997 decomposition reveals that 15 percent of the average product\u2019s 1992 output is accounted \nfor by firms that subsequently drop the product, while 15 percent of 1997 output is due to firms \nthat just added it. Over the same period, the change in the average share of output represented by \nincumbents was just 3 percent (from 67 to 70 percent).32\n32 We find a similar dominance of gross versus net product switching in a decomposition of real US manufacturing \ngrowth that separates real output changes according to firm entry and exit, incumbents\u2019 product adding and dropping, \nand incumbents\u2019 continuing-product growth and decline. A disadvantage of that decomposition relative to the one pre-\nsented here is its reliance on industry-level price indexes to deflate the output of all products within the same industry.\nVOL. 100 NO. 1 87BERNARd ET AL.: mULTIpLE-pROdUCT fIRmS ANd pROdUCT SWITChINg\nC. firm-product Level Evidence\nIn the model, a firm\u2019s profitability in a particular product is the result of an interaction between \nfirm-wide productivity and consumers\u2019 taste for particular firm products. As a result, firms add-\ning products are likely to have higher values of firm productivity than firms whose product range \nremains constant. Likewise, because consumer tastes are serially correlated and so are positively \ncorrelated with firm-product shipments and the length of time for which a firm has produced a \nproduct, firms are more likely to drop products that are small (scale dependence) or relatively \nnew to the firm (age dependence). Finally, variation in consumer taste across products within \nfirms results in differences in the size of shipments across products within firms.\nproduct Adding.\u2014Firms\u2019 product-adding decisions are systematically related to their reve-\nnue-based productivity in existing products in the way suggested by the model.

Table 7 reports the results of OLS \nregressions of a dummy variable indicating product adding by either SP (columns 1\u20134) or MP \nfirms (columns 5\u20138) between 1992 and 1997 on firm revenue-based productivity in 1992,\n(12) Add j t\u200a=\u200a\u03b1m\u200a+\u200a\u03b21productivityj t\u200a+\u200a\u03b5j t ,\nwhere \u03b1m represents a set of product-mix fixed effects and productivityjt is measured in terms \nof either revenue-based labor productivity or TFP. We employ a linear probability model so that \nproduct-mix fixed effects, which allow for a comparison of behavior among firms producing the \nsame initial set of products, can be included in the regression. Given that we estimate the regres-\nsion for a single cross section, the product-mix fixed effects control for the level and change \nof any product-mix-specific characteristic that influences the probability of adding a product \nbetween 1992 and 1997.33\n33 We find similar results for earlier census periods. The analogous specification when census periods are pooled \ninvolves including a full set of interactions between product mix fixed effects and time fixed effects.

We note that we examine the model\u2019s firm-product predictions in the context \nof product dropping because construction of an analogous adding sample is impractical given the \nsize of our dataset. Our sample consists of surviving firms, and therefore the estimated coefficients \ncapture the determinants of a firm\u2019s decision whether to drop products conditional on firm survival.\nAs our regression specification is estimated for a single cross section of data based on the \ndecision whether to drop a product between 1992 and 1997, the firm fixed effects control for any \nfirm characteristic that is common across products and affects the decision whether to drop a \nproduct over this period (e.g., total firm shipments, the growth of total firm shipments, firm age, \nfirm productivity, whether a firm is an exporter or enters\/exits export markets, whether a firm has \nmultiple plants). Similarly, the product fixed effects control for any product characteristic that is \ncommon across firms and influences the decision whether to drop a product (e.g., an aggregate \nchange in relative demand or supply across products). The coefficients \u03b21 and \u03b22 are therefore \nidentified solely from the variation in shipments and tenure that is idiosyncratic to individual \npairs of firms and products.35\nResults are reported with and without firm and firm-plus-product fixed effects. In all three \ncases, coefficient estimates indicate that firms are less likely to drop a product if their shipments \nand tenure are large relative to firms producing the same product.36 To the extent that relative \nfirm-product size and tenure are positively correlated with firm-product revenue-based produc-\ntivity, the results in Table 8 suggest a systematic reallocation of economic resources within firms \ntoward activities that generate more revenue per unit of factor input. As a result, studies of indus-\ntry dynamics that ignore firms\u2019 extensive margins likely underestimate the role of reallocation in \nboth output and revenue-based productivity growth.\nproduct Switching and firm Output.\u2014We find that the process of reallocation within firms \ncaptured in the model is quantitatively important at the firm level as well as at the aggregate \nlevel. To illustrate this, we decompose the output of surviving firms in a given census year \naccording to whether the products are continuously produced versus recently added or about to \nbe dropped. These backward- and forward-looking firm-level decompositions are analogous to \nthose used for products in equations (10) and (11), respectively, above. Here, however, there is \nno contribution from firm entry or exit because the decompositions are undertaken for surviving \nfirms.37 As shown in Table 9, we find that on average 26 and 31 percent of firm output in 1992 \nand 1997, respectively, is represented by products firms added within the previous five years. \nA comparable average share of firm output, 29 and 26 percent for 1987 and 1992, respectively, \nis accounted for by about-to-be-dropped products. These shares suggest that product switching \nexerts considerable influence on firm activity, and that gross changes in firm output are substan-\ntially larger than net changes.\n35 We find similar results for earlier census periods. The analogous specification when census periods are pooled \ninvolves including a full set of interactions between firm and time fixed effects and between product and time fixed \neffects. This specification also yields similar results.\n36 In the model, consumer tastes follow a first-order Markov process, so that the probability of drawing a new value \nfor consumer tastes depends only on the current value of consumer tastes. Furthermore, controlling for firm and prod-\nuct fixed effects, log firm-product shipments are proportional to the current value of consumer tastes. Therefore, as \nin much of the firm entry and exit literature, age or tenure should become insignificant in a specification that controls \nappropriately for scale. One natural explanation for the significance of firm-product tenure in such a specification is that \nconsumer tastes follow a higher-order Markov process, and the model could be extended to allow for this possibility.\n37 We note that the product-level decompositions reported earlier are not simple averages of the firm-level decompo-\nsitions reported here for additional reasons besides the focus on surviving firms. In particular, the weight of firms in the \nproduct-level decompositions varies substantially depending on their size, and the firm-level decompositions include a \nfirm\u2019s output across all products.\nmARCh 201090 ThE AmERICAN ECONOmIC REVIEW\ndistribution of product Shipments within firms.\u2014To provide evidence on the product het-\nerogeneity within firms featured in the model, Table 10 reports the average share of firm output \nrepresented by each of a firm\u2019s products, with products sorted from largest to smallest. To con-\nform with census disclosure requirements, we report these average shares for firms producing up \nto ten products. We note that firms producing ten or fewer products represent roughly 99 percent \nof firms and roughly half of US manufacturing shipments in our sample. As shown in the table, \nthe distribution of output across products is highly skewed, with the average share of firm output \nattributable to a firm\u2019s largest product declining from 80 percent for firms that produce two prod-\nucts to 46 percent for firms that produce 10 products.\nA commonly used benchmark in the literature on firm size distributions is the Pareto distribu-\ntion, which predicts a log linear regression relationship between the log rank of firm shipments \nand log firm shipments.

The fitted and actual values for firm-product rank and size in \nthese regressions are displayed in Figure 2. As indicated in the figure, actual values lie above the \nregression line in the middle of the distribution and below the regression line in the tails, implying \nthinner tails than the Pareto distribution.39 Therefore, the heterogeneity across products within \nfirms stressed in our model displays the same features as the heterogeneity across firms examined \nin the firm-size distribution literature (see, for example, Rossi-Hansberg and Wright 2007).\nD. Alternate Explanations\nOur empirical analysis of product adding and dropping thus far accords well with features of \nproduct switching highlighted by our model of endogenous product selection. Here, we discuss \npotential alternate explanations for the facts we uncover and the extent to which they receive \nsupport from the data.\nExplanations of product switching fall into three broad categories according to whether they \nfocus on factors that are specific to products, on factors that are specific to firms, or on factors that \nare idiosyncratic to firm-product pairings. The first category of explanations emphasizes forces that \nare product specific but common to all firms, such as changes in relative demand (e.g., changing \nfashions) or relative supply (e.g., changing technology). Explanations of this form that involve a net \nreallocation of economic activity across products, e.g., from \u201ccold\u201d to \u201chot\u201d products, are hard to \nreconcile with the positive correlation between products\u2019 add and drop rates observed in Figure 1.\n38 If the distribution of shipments, x, across products within firms shown in Table 10 is Pareto with minimum value k \nand shape parameter a, we have Pr (x\u200a>\u200ax\u2032\u200a)\u200a=\u200a(k\/x\u2032\u200a)a. Taking logarithms in this expression and rearranging terms yields \nthe following relationships: log (Rankp )\u200a=\u200aA \u2212 a log (xp )\u200a=\u200aB \u2212 a log (Sharep ), where Rankp is the rank of xp , Sharep\u200a=\u200a\nxp\/X, and A, B, and X\u200a=\u200a \u2211\u200ap    xp are constants.\n39 Including a quadratic term in log product size in the regression, we find that a null hypothesis of linearity is \nstrongly rejected at conventional levels of statistical significance. From a comparison of the tails across the panels of \nFigure 2, the departures from a Pareto distribution increase with the number of products that firms produce.\nTable 10\u2014Mean Distribution of Within-Firm Output Shares, 1987 to 1997\nNumber of products produced by the firm\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\nA\nve\nra\nge\n p\ner\nce\nnt\n o\nf \nou\ntp\nut\n 1 100 80 70 63 58 54 52 50 48 46\n 2 19 21 22 21 21 21 20 20 20\n 3 7 9 10 11 11 11 11 12\n 4 4 5 6 7 7 7 7\n 5 2 3 4 4 5 5\n 6 2 2 3 3 3\n 7 1 2 2 2\n 8 1 1 2\n 9 1 1\n10 1\nNotes: Columns indicate the number of products produced by the firm.

Positive shocks to a firm\u2019s productivity, for example, might \nincrease the profitability of all products it could produce, thereby inducing the firm to add previ-\nously unprofitable products. This class of explanations, however, is hard to reconcile with the fact \nthat firms simultaneously add and drop products across census years. Such switching suggests \nthat any firm-specific shocks differentially affect its products, and are therefore firm-product \nspecific. A more fundamental challenge for both firm- and product-specific explanations of prod-\nuct switching is our finding that firm-product characteristics are influential determinants of prod-\nuct switching, even after controlling separately for firm and product characteristics.\nThe model developed in Section I falls into the third category of explanations, which concentrates \non the role of firm-product attributes in influencing product switching. In our model, the interaction \nof idiosyncratic shocks to firm productivity and firm-product demand fosters both self-selection of \nfirms and self-selection of products within firms. Klette and Kortum (2004)\u2014 hereafter KK\u2014offer \nan alternate firm-product approach that emphasizes innovation.40 In the KK model, products cycle \nacross firms as they exchange technological dominance. While this model is consistent with some \nof the stylized facts we present (e.g., product switching across census years), it fails to capture \nothers. In KK, for example, the firm-size distribution is determined entirely by variation in the \nextensive margin of the number of products firms produce. In the data, however, we find that the \nintensive margin of output per product is quite influential in determining variation in firm size.41 \n40 See also Rasmus Lentz and Dale T. Mortenson (2005), Luttmer (2008), and Chatterjee and Rossi-Hansberg (2008) \nfor other innovation-based models of firm scope.\n41 Regressing the log of firm average output per product (the intensive margin) and the log of firm number of prod-\nucts (the extensive margin) on the log of firm total output, we find that the intensive margin accounts for around 90 \npercent of the cross-section variation in firm size.\n1\n2\n3\n4\nP\nro\ndu\nct\n r\nan\nk\n5 10 20 40 60\nProduct size (percent)\n4 Products\n1\n2\n4\n6\nP\nro\ndu\nct\n r\nan\nk\n5 10 20 40 60\nProduct size (percent)\n6 Products\n1\n2\n4\n6\n8\nP\nro\ndu\nct\n r\nan\nk\n5 10 20 40 60\nProduct size (percent)\n8 Products\n1\n2\n4\n6\n10\nP\nro\ndu\nct\n r\nan\nk\n5 10 20 40 60\nProduct size (percent)\nFitted\nActual\n10 Products\nWithin-firm product size versus rank\nFigure 2.

Here, however, we find that the probability that a \nfirm drops a product is decreasing in firm-product shipments and the length of time for which the \nfirm has produced the product. Though our data motivate the development of the selection model \ndescribed above, we believe that extending innovation-based models to match our new stylized \nfacts is another interesting avenue for further research.\nIV.\u2002 Extending\u2002the\u2002Basic\u2002Selection\u2002Model\nIn this section we highlight several dimensions of the data that are less well captured by either \nour model or the alternative potential explanations discussed above, but which point to poten-\ntially fruitful lines of future theoretical and empirical research.\nA. product Coproduction\nOur first set of additional results relates to the types of goods firms tend to produce together. \nTable 11 reports the average annual frequency, in thousands, with which firms coproduce prod-\nucts within and across sectors from 1987 to 1997. Dark shading indicates coproduction that is \nsignificantly more frequent than expected based on the individual probabilities of producing \neach product, while light shading indicates significantly less coproduction.42 As shown in the \ntable, the probability that a firm produces a product in the row sector conditional on  production \nof a product in the column sector is relatively high within sectors as well as between sectors that \nappear related (e.g., Apparel and Textiles, or Electronics and Industrial Machinery). Furthermore, \nthe matrix of data as a whole rejects the null hypothesis that the probability a firm produces a \nproduct is independent of the firm\u2019s other products (\u200ap-value <\u200a0.01).\nIn developing our model, we assumed for simplicity that consumer tastes \u03bbi were independently \ndistributed across products. As a result, the only interdependence in firm sales across products \narises from firm productivity \u03c6, which raises or reduces a firm\u2019s sales across all products propor-\ntionately. However, the findings in Table 11 suggest richer forms of interdependence, where some \npairs of products are systematically coproduced within firms, while other pairs of products are sys-\ntematically produced in separate firms.43 One way of extending the model to capture richer forms \nof interdependence is to allow consumer tastes (or equivalently a product-specific component of \nproductivity) to be correlated across products. For example, product characteristics that are highly \nvalued in one product market (e.g., apparel) may be highly valued in another product market (e.g., \ntextiles). While such an extension would bring the model closer to the data, this would come at the \ncost of making the model considerably less tractable. Nevertheless, achieving greater understand-\ning of the sources of interdependence in demand or production technology across products within \nfirms would be useful.\n42 We assess statistical significance by comparing the observed coproduction frequencies to those that would be \nexpected under a null hypothesis that the decisions to produce row and column product lines are independent. Under \nthis null, the expected frequency with which a particular pair of major sectors is coproduced follows an independent \nPoisson distribution. An individual cell\u2019s deviation from random coproduction therefore follows a standard normal dis-\ntribution, ((orc \u2212 erc)\/\u200a\u221a\u200a__\u200aerc )\u200a\u223c\u200aN (0, 1), where orc and erc are the observed and expected frequencies in row r  and column \nc, respectively. Summing across cells, the statistic for testing whether the entire matrix of frequencies is generated by \nrandom coproduction,  \u2211\u200ar,c    (orc \u2212 erc)2\/erc\u200a, is distributed chi-squared.\n43 Similarly, the coproduction findings in Table 11 sit awkwardly with the assumption in the innovation-based model \nof Klette and Kortum (2004) that the identity of the product to which a firm\u2019s innovation applies is drawn randomly \nfrom the set of potential products.\nmARCh 201094 ThE AmERICAN ECONOmIC REVIEW\nB. modes of product Switching\nOur second set of additional results relates to the mode by which firms add and drop products. \nThere are a variety of ways in which firms can add a product: at existing facilities, at newly \nconstructed plants, or by acquiring an existing plant from another firm. Similarly, firms can drop \nproducts at continuing plants by closing plants or by selling plants to another firm.\nTable 12 reports the distribution of product adds (panel A) and drops (panel B) according to \nhow they are accomplished. As indicated in the first column of each panel, roughly 85 percent of \nadded and dropped products, respectively, are added and dropped at existing plants. The share of \nthe number of products added and dropped through mergers and acquisitions (M&A) is relatively \nTable 11\u2014Product Coproduction within Firms, 1987 to 1997\nSector 20 31 30 22 23 39 24 26 25 27 28 29 32 33 34 35 36 37 38\n20 Food 158 2  9  5 16  5  6  9  6  11 42  3  4  6  15  16  8  5  4\n31 Leather   2 1  1  1  3  1  1  1  1   1  1  0  0  1   2  1  1  0  0\n30 Rubber and plastic   9 1 47  8  9  7  8 10  6   6 24  2  6 13  33  41 22 12 11\n22 Textile   5 1  8 25 18  3  3  4  3   4 11  1  2  4   8   8  5  3  3\n23 Apparel  16 3  9 18 64  6  6  6  6   9 12  1  3  7  20  21  9  5  5\n39 Miscellaneous   5 1  7  3  6 10  3  3  2   9  6  0  1  3  10   9  6  3  3\n24 Lumber   6 1  8  3  6  3 79 16 16   5  9  1  4  5  16  10  6  3  3\n26 Paper   9 1 10  4  6  3 16 19  3  23 13  1  3  5  12  12  6  2  4\n25 Furniture   6 1  6  3  6  2 16  3 23   3  4  0  1  4  12  10  7  3  3\n27 Printing and pub.  11 1  6  4  9  9  5 23  3 401 10  1  2  5  13  15 10  4  5\n28 Chemicals  42 1 24 11 12  6  9 13  4  10 74 13 10 16  25  29 20 10 18\n29 Petroleum   3 0  2  1  1  0  1  1  0   1 13  4  2  3   4   3  2  1  1\n32 Stone and concrete   4 0  6  2  3  1  4  3  1   2 10  2 10  6  11  11  7  3  3\n33 Primary metal   6 1 13  4  7  3  5  5  4   5 16  3  6 27  48  47 29 15 10\n34 Fabricated metal  15 2 33  8 20 10 16 12 12  13 25  4 11 48 124 117 53 30 22\n35 Industrial mach  16 1 41  8 21  9 10 12 10  15 29  3 11 47 117 119 72 38 31\n36 Electronic   8 1 22  5  9  6  6  6  7  10 20  2  7 29  53  72 70 25 37\n37 Transportation   5 0 12  3  5  3  3  2  3   4 10  1  3 15  30  38 25 18 10\n38 Instruments   4 0 11  3  5  3  3  4  3   5 18  1  3 10  22  31 37 10 14\nNotes: The table summarizes coproduction of five-digit SIC categories across multiple-product firms.

However, \nas shown in the second column of each panel, M&A activity is substantially more important \nas a share of the value of products added and dropped, indicating that the products added and \ndropped through plant acquisitions or divestitures are on average larger than those added and \ndropped through other modes of product switching. The third and fourth columns of each panel \nshow that a similar pattern is observed for the share of firms that add and drop products.\nA distinct but related issue is the extent to which M&A is accompanied by any of the modes \nof products switching. Comparing product and sector switching according to whether firms con-\ncomitantly acquire or divest a plant, we find that firms involved in an ownership change are rela-\ntively more likely to change their mix of products, as reported in Table A4 in the Web Technical \nAppendix. An average of 94 percent of firms that engage in M&A activity also alter their mix of \nproducts, compared with an average of 53 percent for firms that do not participate in an acquisi-\ntion or divestiture. For sector switching, the importance of M&A is even more stark: the analo-\ngous percentages are 67 and 15 percent.\nWhile our finding that product switching frequently occurs within firms\u2019 existing plants moti-\nvates the model\u2019s abstraction from M&A and the creation of new plants, the introduction of these \ncomplementary modes of product switching is an interesting area for further research.\nV.\u2002 Conclusions\nThe extent to which resources are allocated to their best use is a primary concern of econom-\nics. Virtually all empirical research on reallocation as a source of industry output and measured \nproductivity growth focuses on plant or firm entry and exit or changes in the composition of \noutput across plants or firms. This paper identifies product switching as an important source of \nreallocation within firms and analyzes its determinants and consequences.\nGuided by a natural extension of existing models of industry dynamics that allows firms to pro-\nduce an endogenous range of products in response to evolving firm and product characteristics, \nTable 12\u2014How Products are Added and Dropped, 1987 to 1997\nShare of products Share of firms\nUnweighted Value-weighted Unweighted Value-weighted\npanel A. method of product adding\nExisting plant(s) only 0.862 0.412 0.899 0.259\nAcquired plant(s) only 0.055 0.259 0.013 0.048\nNew plant(s) only 0.060 0.120 0.030 0.044\nCombination with M&A 0.013 0.147 0.031 0.488\nCombination without M&A 0.011 0.061 0.027 0.161\npanel B. method of product dropping\nExisting plant(s) only 0.835 0.320 0.898 0.213\nDivested plant(s) only 0.052 0.282 0.007 0.018\nClosed plants only 0.084 0.123 0.037 0.042\nCombination with M&A 0.015 0.231 0.026 0.538\nCombination without M&A 0.013 0.045 0.033 0.189\nNotes: Table reports the manner in which firms add (panel A) and drop (panel B) five-digit SIC products.

Using a novel dataset \nthat tracks US manufacturing output at the level of five-digit products within firms, we find that \nfirms add and drop products with surprising intensity and frequency. On average, 54 percent of \nUS manufacturing firms alter their mix of five-digit products every five years, and these adjust-\nments lead an average of 41 percent of firms to enter new or exit existing four-digit industries, \nand 16 percent of firms to extend or contract their set of two-digit sectors. Overall, we find that \nthe gross contributions of product adding and dropping to the evolution of aggregate manufactur-\ning output are as large as the gross contributions of firm entry and exit.\nWe demonstrate that observed patterns of product switching are inconsistent with explanations \nbased purely on net reallocation across products, and are more generally hard to reconcile with \nexplanations based on firm or product shocks alone. In contrast, we find support for the central \nfeatures of our extended model of industry dynamics, which emphasizes selection within as well \nas across firms. In particular, the model accounts for the positive correlation across products \nbetween the rate of product adding and dropping and the age and scale dependence observed in \nthe probability a product is dropped.\nThough our basic framework is a good match for key features of the census data, additional \nempirical analysis reveals areas in which it might be extended. In the current version of the \nmodel, for example, the only source of dependence in profitability across a firm\u2019s products is \nthe firm\u2019s overall productivity: higher firm productivity raises the profitability of all products. \nEmpirical examination of firms\u2019 product mix, however, reveals that firms are more likely to co-\nmanufacture products within the same industry, or within \u201clinked\u201d industries, e.g., lumber and \nfurniture or electronics and instruments. An extended version of our model might incorporate \ndemand- or supply-side complementarities that rationalize these links. Similarly, extending the \nmodel to allow firms to endogenously choose between various modes of product switching, such \nas plant creation and M&A, is another interesting avenue for future research.\nREFERENCES\nArmenter,\u2002Roc\u2002and\u2002Miklos\u2002Koren.\u20022008. \u201cA Balls and Bins Model of Trade.\u201d Unpublished.\nBaily,\u2002Martin\u2002Neil,\u2002Charles\u2002Hulten,\u2002and\u2002David\u2002Campbell.\u20021992. \u201cProductivity Dynamics in Manufacturing \nPlants.\u201d Brookings papers on Economic Activity: 187\u2013249.\nBaldwin,\u2002John,\u2002and\u2002Wulong\u2002Gu.\u20022009. \u201cThe Impact of Trade on Plant Scale, Production-Run Length, and \nDiversification.\u201d In producer dynamics: New Evidence from micro data, ed.
