The current study examines whether ICU doctors and nurses have a \nshared perception of interdisciplinary communication in the UK intensive care unit.  \nMethods: Cross-sectional survey of ICU nurses and doctors in four UK hospitals \nusing a previously established measure of ICU interdisciplinary collaboration.  \nResults: A sample of 48 doctors and 136 nurses (47% response rate) from 4 ICUs \nresponded to the survey. Nurses and doctors were found to have differing perceptions \nof interdisciplinary communication, with nurses reporting lower levels of \ncommunication openness between nurses and doctors. Compared to senior doctors, \ntrainee doctors also reported lower levels of communication openness between \ndoctors. Furthermore, a regression path analysis revealed that communication \nopenness amongst ICU team members predicted the degree to which individuals \nreported understanding their patient care goals (adjR2 = 0.17). It also showed that \nperceptions of the quality of unit leadership predicted open communication.  \nConclusions: Members of ICU teams have divergent perceptions of their \ncommunication with one another. Communication openness amongst team members \nis also associated with the degree to which they understand patient care goals. In order \nto ensure team members in the ICU feel that they can communicate openly, it is \nnecessary to create a safe atmosphere where team members feel they can \ncommunicate openly without fear of reprisal or embarrassment. \nKey words: Teamwork; Interdisciplinary communication; patient safety; leadership; \npatient care planning  \nPublished as: Reader, T., Flin, R., Mearns, K., & Cuthbertson, B. (2007). Interdisciplinary communication in the Intensive Care Unit. British Journal of Anaesthesia, 98, \n347-352 \n 3 \nIntroduction  \nEffective team communication and coordination are recognised as being crucial for \nimproving quality and safety in acute medical settings such as the intensive care unit \n(ICU) 1,2. Research studying communication failures in medical teams has indicated \nthe influence that hierarchical and social factors have upon the behaviours of junior \nmedical staff. Communication failures can emerge from junior team members being \nreluctant to communicate openly with senior team members because of a fear of either \nappearing incompetent, or of being rejected, embarrassed or reprimanded 3. \nAttitudinal research in the US has indicated that ICU team members have divergent \nperceptions of their communication behaviours, with more nurses than doctors \nreporting difficulties in speaking-up about problems with patient care, and fewer \nnurses reporting that teamwork between nurses and doctors is well coordinated 4,5. \nNot only do such factors increase the likelihood of medical errors occurring 6, the \ndegree to which communication in the ICU is open may also influence the degree to \nwhich patient care duties are understood. Through the use of communication \ninterventions that promote teamwork across role boundaries (e.g. ICU daily goals \nsheets), making communication more inclusive and explicit has been shown to \nincrease team members\u2019 understanding of patient care plans in the ICU 7,8.  \n \nThe current study examined whether nurses and doctors working in UK ICUs have \ndiffering perceptions of their interdisciplinary communication, with the prediction \nbeing that trainee team members (e.g. trainee doctors) will have less positive \nperceptions than senior team members (e.g. senior doctors). Furthermore, this study \nexamined whether individuals who report higher levels of open communication within \nthe ICU also report having a better understanding of their patient care goals, and \nPublished as: Reader, T., Flin, R., Mearns, K., & Cuthbertson, B.

British Journal of Anaesthesia, 98, \n347-352 \n 4 \nwhether the leadership of senior ICU staff is important in fostering a perception of \ncommunication openness.  \n \n \nPublished as: Reader, T., Flin, R., Mearns, K., & Cuthbertson, B. (2007). Interdisciplinary communication in the Intensive Care Unit. British Journal of Anaesthesia, 98, \n347-352 \n 5 \nMethod \nParticipants \nThe study was a cross-sectional survey carried out in 4 Scottish ICUs during July to \nDecember 2005. The ICUs were closed units (where patients are admitted only after \napproval, and are cared for full-time, by intensivists and their teams). Doctors and \nnurses agreed to be surveyed with regards to interdisciplinary collaboration in their \nunit (table 1). Ethical approval was acquired from relevant review bodies. At each \nlocation, a senior nurse distributed questionnaires to the nursing staff, and a senior \ndoctor distributed questionnaires to the medical staff. In total, 400 questionnaires \nwere distributed over the course of a month. The questionnaires were anonymous, \nwith participants returning the completed questionnaires in freepost envelopes to the \nresearch team.  \n \nINSERT TABLE 1 HERE \n \nMaterials \nThe survey measure was adapted from the \u2018Interdisciplinary Collaboration\u2019 \nquestionnaire developed by Shortell et al. 9, which contains a range of questions on \nICU communication between interdisciplinary groups (i.e. between nurses and \ndoctors), and within interdisciplinary groups (i.e. between doctors). The tool is \npsychometrically well validated 10, and has been used previously to assess ICU \nteamwork in the US 11-13. Twelve scales regarding communication and leadership \nwere taken from the survey instrument (table 2), and terminology was adapted for the \nUK with the help of an ICU consultant and an ICU senior nurse. One additional 5-\nitem scale was specially developed for the survey.  This scale measured how often \nPublished as: Reader, T., Flin, R., Mearns, K., & Cuthbertson, B. (2007). Interdisciplinary communication in the Intensive Care Unit. British Journal of Anaesthesia, 98, \n347-352 \n 6 \nICU staff feel they understand the patient care plans and potential safety risks for the \npatients under their care. The scale was based on questions used in studies examining \nthe understanding of patient care duties 7,8, was developed with ICU staff, and was \npiloted successfully in the first surveyed unit. Biodata such as age and gender were \nnot requested in order to ensure anonymity and increase participation in the study. \n \nINSERT TABLE 2 HERE \n \nStatistical analysis \nPrior to any analysis, the internal reliability of the questionnaire scales was assessed \nby calculating Cronbach\u2019s alpha scores, (these indicate the consistency of responses to \nthe items that comprise a questionnaire scale). A Cronbach\u2019s alpha score of above 0.7 \nindicates acceptable consistency 14. All but three scales showed acceptable reliability \n(\u03b1 >= 0.7). Two scales (accuracy between shifts, and accuracy within shifts) showed \nreliability slightly below the acceptance criteria (\u03b1 > 0.6). Although not ideal, it was \nconsistent with the original questionnaire validation criteria, and thus the scales were \nretained. However, the \u2018shift communication between groups\u2019 scale had unacceptably \nlow reliability (\u03b1 = 0.47) and was excluded from further analysis. The distribution of \nrespondent scores was found to be normal for all scales except \u2018Understanding patient \ncare goals\u2019, which had a negatively skewed distribution. In order to normalise the \nscale, a \u2018log transformation\u2019 was performed. Multivariate analysis of variance \n(MANOVA) was conducted to examine whether there was an overall effect for \ndifferences in responses to perceptions of communication between i) doctors and \nnurses, and between ii) senior doctors and trainee doctors, and senior nurses and \ntrainee nurses. Post-hoc tests were then conducted to examine the specific differences \nPublished as: Reader, T., Flin, R., Mearns, K., & Cuthbertson, B. (2007). Interdisciplinary communication in the Intensive Care Unit.

Additionally, the proportions of staff within each group that reported very \npositive perceptions (between 4 & 5) on each scale, (and thus may perceive a reduced \nneed for improvements in teamwork) were calculated along with Cohen\u2019s d effect \nsizes 15, which are used to examine the strength of an observed effect and are reported \nas Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients. \n \nA multiple regression was conducted to examine whether open communication in the \nICU predicts respondent reports of understanding patient care goals. Lastly, a \nmediation analysis using regression path analysis (which is used to examine the \nmechanisms through which one variable affects another, whilst taking into the \naccount the variance explained by a third variable) 16 examined whether unit \nleadership was also important in predicting understanding patient care goals whilst \ntaking into account the variance explained by reports of open communication in the \nICU. Data were analysed using SPSS for Windows version 14.  \n \n \nPublished as: Reader, T., Flin, R., Mearns, K., & Cuthbertson, B. (2007). Interdisciplinary communication in the Intensive Care Unit. British Journal of Anaesthesia, 98, \n347-352 \n 8 \nResults \nA total of 184 questionnaires were returned (47% response rate): 48 questionnaires \n(26% of the sample) were received from doctors (17 senior doctors, 13 specialist \nregistrars, 15 senior house officers, and 3 unknown) and 136 (74% of the sample) \nwere received from nurses (24 senior nurses and 112 staff nurses). The mean response \nscores showed a similar pattern of results to the original US scale 9, with the majority \nof respondents reporting positive responses to the questionnaire scales (table 2). The \nMANOVA showed a significant effect (\u03bb= .750, F(14, 164) = 3.59, p <0.001) in terms \nof the groups taking part in the study reporting different perceptions of \ncommunication. Furthermore, the post-hoc analysis revealed a number of significant \ndifferences between professional groups (Table 3). Doctors reported significantly \nhigher levels of communication openness when compared to nurses (p < 0.01). \nSpecifically, most senior doctors (82%), and over half of trainee doctors (60%), \nreported very high levels of communication openness between nurses and doctors, as \ncompared to around a third of nurses (37%). Senior doctors also reported significantly \nhigher levels of communication openness between doctors (p < 0.05), with 88% of \nsenior doctors reporting very positive perceptions, as compared to 53% of trainee \ndoctors. For communication accuracy, senior doctors reported less positive \nperceptions of communication accuracy between themselves and both nurses (p < \n0.01) and trainee doctors (p < 0.05).  \n \n \nINSERT TABLE 3 \n \nPublished as: Reader, T., Flin, R., Mearns, K., & Cuthbertson, B. (2007). Interdisciplinary communication in the Intensive Care Unit. British Journal of Anaesthesia, 98, \n347-352 \n 9 \nThe multiple regression analysis revealed communication openness between and \nwithin groups to be significant predictors of understanding patient care goals, \naccounting for approximately 17% of the variance (adjR2 = 0.17, p < 0.001). A \nregression path analysis was conducted to examine the mediational model \nhypothesising that perceptions of unit leadership predict reports of open \ncommunication in the ICU, which in turn influences the degree to which staff \nunderstand patient care goals. Due to the similarity between the two communication \nopenness and leadership scales, and also due to regression path analysis only being \nable to examine the relationship between three variables (a predictor, a mediator, and \na dependent variable), it was decided to amalgamate both communication openness \nscales into one \u2018open communication in the ICU\u2019 scale, and also to amalgamate both \nleadership scales into one \u2018unit leadership\u2019 scale. The regression path analysis showed \nthe data to be consistent with the hypothesised mediational model due to it meeting \nthe required mediation assumptions as described by Baron and Kenny 16. Figure 1 \ndescribes the path analysis and shows the regression output and the Sobel test statistic. \nThis was conducted to assess the significance of mediational effects, and showed \ncommunication openness to account for 52% of the variance explained by the \nrelationship between unit leadership and understanding patient care goals, thus \nsupporting the mediational model.  \n \nINSERT FIGURE 1 HERE \n \nPublished as: Reader, T., Flin, R., Mearns, K., & Cuthbertson, B. (2007). Interdisciplinary communication in the Intensive Care Unit. British Journal of Anaesthesia, 98, \n347-352 \n 10 \nDiscussion \nThe results indicate that doctors and nurses in the UK intensive care environment \nhave differing perceptions of multidisciplinary communication in the ICU. Nurses \nreported less communication openness between the two groups, whilst senior doctors \nhad particularly positive perceptions. Senior doctors and trainee doctors also show a \ndistinction in their perceptions of communication openness between doctors, with \nsenior doctors reporting more positive perceptions. However, senior doctors reported \nless favourable responses than trainee staff in terms of their perceptions of \ncommunication accuracy in the ICU. Factors that are likely to produce such differing \nperspectives on communication include hierarchical factors, gender, differing patient \ncare responsibilities, differing perceptions of requisite communication standards, and \ndifferences in the training methods of nurses and doctors 4. The regression analysis \nfound open communication amongst team members in the ICU to be a predictor of the \ndegree to which individuals report understanding patient care goals. Although only a \nmoderate predictor (other factors such as medical training, unit culture, and years of \nICU experience might also be strong predictors), communication openness may \nfacilitate the understanding of patient care goals through junior team members feeling \nmore able to ask senior team members for confirmation of patient care duties, to \ndiscuss patient care plans issues they do not understand, and to become more involved \nin developing patient care goals. Lastly, the finding that unit leadership is an \nimportant determinant of open communication is consistent with leadership research \nin other domains 17.  \n \nThe importance of communication openness in medical teams has been documented \npreviously. In particular, creating a safe atmosphere where team members feel they \nPublished as: Reader, T., Flin, R., Mearns, K., & Cuthbertson, B. (2007). Interdisciplinary communication in the Intensive Care Unit. British Journal of Anaesthesia, 98, \n347-352 \n 11 \ncan speak up should they have any safety concerns or issues with the quality of care \nprovided to patients is essential 18,19. This atmosphere can be created through team \nleadership that advocates a less steep hierarchy: that shows a willingness to listen to \nthe concerns and ideas of junior team members: that recognises human limitations, \nand that clearly states expected team interaction patterns 19-21. Also important for \ndeveloping open communication amongst teams is the implementation of protocols \n(e.g. communication checklists) that support communication across hierarchical \nboundaries 7,22, and team-based training that encourages assertiveness, \ninterdisciplinary communication, and a shared perception of teamwork 18,23.  \n \nStudy limitations \nThere are a number of limitations to this study. Firstly, although the return rate is not \nas high as in some other healthcare surveys 4, it is comparable to other teamwork \nresearch conducted in other domains 24. Secondly, the measures used in the survey \nwere all self-report measures, which renders the study susceptible to common method \nbias and social desirability biases. In particular, the patient care goals scale showed a \nskew towards respondents reporting that they always understand their patient care \nduties; in future this could be more objectively assessed through observational \ntechniques. The unequal sample sizes reported in the study are also a potential \nconfounding factor, with a small sample of senior doctors compared to nurses and \ntrainee doctors. Also, the lack of demographic data did not allow comparisons \nbetween female and male ICU team members, which has previously been proposed to \nbe a factor in the differing perceptions of nurses and doctors 4. Future research may \nwish to focus further on senior doctors in order to provide data on a larger sample, as \nwell as exploring the factors (e.g. leadership) underlying divergence in perceptions of \nPublished as: Reader, T., Flin, R., Mearns, K., & Cuthbertson, B. (2007). Interdisciplinary communication in the Intensive Care Unit. British Journal of Anaesthesia, 98, \n347-352 \n 12 \nteamwork and open communication. A new study is currently underway with a \npsychologist observing communication during morning rounds and ICU round \nmembers\u2019 recording their personal judgements of patient state for each consultation. \n \nConclusions \nPatient safety research has shown communication failures to be causal factors in many \nICU critical incidents. This study indicated that different professional groups of ICU \nteam members have divergent perceptions of communication in the ICU. \nCommunication openness was also found to be associated with the degree to which \nteam members report understanding patient care goals. In order to ensure team \nmembers in the ICU feel that they can communicate openly, it is necessary to create a \nsafe atmosphere where team members feel they can speak up openly without fear of \nreprisal or embarrassment if they have any safety concerns or issues with the quality \nof care provided to patients. \nPublished as: Reader, T., Flin, R., Mearns, K., & Cuthbertson, B.
