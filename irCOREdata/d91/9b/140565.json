INTRODUCTION\nThe abscission and decomposition of senesced leaves are\nimportant processes in the functioning of ecosystems. The\nconcentrations of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) and their\nratios in leaf-litter can determine the litter decay rate, the rate\nof return to the soil, their subsequent availability for other\nplants and soil organisms, and potential N leaching or ni-\ntrous oxide release (Berg and McClaugherty, 2003). Forests\nand woodlands account for about 28% of the terrestrial sur-\nface of the Earth, and hence the abscission and decomposi-\ntion of the leaves from woody plants form a vital part of the\nglobal process of nutrient cycling (H\u00e4ttenschwiler et al., 2008;\nMcGroddy et al., 2004).\n* Corresponding author: chjliu@sjtu.edu.cn\nThe concentration of nutrients in leaf-litter and how this\nvaries globally with climatic factors is an area of active re-\nsearch (\u00c5gren, 2008; H\u00e4ttenschwiler et al., 2008; Manzoni\net al., 2008; McGroddy et al., 2004; Yuan and Chen, 2009b).\nAerts (1997) reported that both leaf-litter N and P concen-\ntrations follow a positive but non-linear relationship with ac-\ntual evapotranspiration based on a dataset concerning cool and\nwarm temperate sites, the Mediterranean and the humid low-\nland tropics. Liu et al. (2006) reported that leaf-litter N con-\ncentration increased linearly with mean annual temperature\n(MAT, \u25e6C) and mean annual precipitation (MAP, mm) at a re-\ngional scale. Yuan and Chen (2009b) reported a linear increase\nfor the N concentration and decrease for the P concentration in\nleaf-litter with increased MAT and MAP. In addition, for live\nleaves at a global scale, there is a non-linear relationship be-\ntween the N (or P) concentration and climate factors (Reich\nArticle published by EDP Sciences\nAnn. For. Sci. 67 (2010) 811 H. Kang et al.\nand Oleksyn, 2004; Yin, 1993). The nutrient status of leaf-\nlitter nutrient status is primarily the product of the nutrient sta-\ntus of live leaves and the ratio of nutrient resorption back into\nthe plant during senescence (Killingbeck, 1996; Kobe et al.,\n2005; Ratnam et al., 2008). As an inference, in this context,\nleaf-litter N (or P) concentration would display a non-linear re-\nlationship with climatic factors. Hence the aim of this research\nis to investigate the relationships based on a new dataset.\nOne possible reason for different responses with MAT and\nMAP is the confounding of climatic effects with species ef-\nfects. Different functional groups such as broadleaf trees,\nconifers and shrubs can show different concentrations of leaf-\nlitter N and P, with for example conifers generally showing\nlower values than that for broadleaf trees (Yuan and Chen,\n2009b). Differences between leaf-litter chemical traits have\nalso been reported for different biomes (boreal, temperate,\nand tropical biomes) (McGroddy et al., 2004; Yuan and Chen,\n2009b), but not compared between different continents. Coni-\nnental differences may also be possible because of differences\nin geology. For example Han et al. (2005) reported that the\nlow P concentration of P in the unsenesced leaves in China\nwas caused by the low availability of P in Chinese soils.\nDuring recent years, we have compiled a global dataset of\nleaf-litter N and P of woody plants based on a survey of the lit-\nerature and the Eurasian dataset of Liu et al. (2006). Although\nthis dataset shares 44 papers with Yuan and Chen\u2019s (2009b)\nmeta-analysis of global trends of leaf-litter N and P reported,\nthis amounts to only 13% of their dataset. Hence our present\ndataset is complementary to previous studies and we expect it\nto improve our understanding of the variations in leaf-litter N\nand P at a global scale.\nFor a global analysis of leaf-litter N and P, the role of tem-\nperature and precipitation are particularly important. Both can\naffect the functional type of vegetation and the rate of chemical\nprocesses (Liu et al., 2006; Yuan and Chen, 2009b). Other cli-\nmatic factors that have been implicated include actual evapo-\ntranspiration (AET, mm) which when integrated with precip-\nitation it can describe the water balance (Aerts, 1997). Lastly\nthe use of latitude (LAT, defined as degrees away from the\nEquator) can act as an alternative measure of temperature\nand water availability combined with seasonality (Berg et al.,\n1995).\nThe objectives of this study were to determine at a global\nscale the leaf-litter N, P and N:P ratio of (1) different func-\ntional plant groups, (2) different continental groupings., and\n(3) the relationship with mean annual temperature, mean an-\nnual preciptation and latitude. To achieve these objectives we\ncompiled a global data set of N and P concentrations and N:P\nratios for the leaf-litter of woody plants, by expanding a data\nset of 204 samples for Eurasia (Liu et al., 2006) to a total of\n677 samples worldwide.\n2. METHODS\n2.1. Data collection\nThe data used in this study was compiled from publications\non leaf-litter N and P concentrations at a global scale (data\nin Appendix S1, available on line only at www.afs-journal.\norg). A total of 677 data samples were included, encompassing\n401 species from 24 countries. The sites ranged from 41.37\u25e6 S\nto 68.37\u25e6 N in latitude, from 155.67\u25e6 W to 0 to 151.45\u25e6 E in\nlongitude, from 0 to 2 920 m in altitude, from \u20134.9 to 30.2 \u25e6C\nin MAT, and from 200 to 5 260 mm in MAP. The distribution\nof data was showed in Figure 1.\nThe studies concerning N-fixing species and the fertilized\nstands were not included in the dataset in present study. To\nensure data comparability, the unit percentage (%) used by\nsome authors for nutrient concentration was converted to units\nof mg g\u22121. If climate data were not provided in the original\ndata source, MAT and MAP were calculated based on the\ncoordinates and altitudes using the Local Climate Estimator\n\u201cNew_LocClim V1.10\u201d (FAO 2006).\n2.2. Data processing\nThe leaf-litter data were analyzed in four functional groups:\n\u201cshrubs\u201d, \u201cconiferous trees\u201d, \u201cdeciduous broadleaf trees\u201d and\n\u201cevergreen broadleaf trees\u201d in order to determine differences\nin N and P concentrations and the N:P ratio. The leaf-litter data\nwere also analysed according to six continental areas: North\nAmerica (NA), South America (SA), Europe (EU), Africa\n(AF), and Asian mainland (AM). In view of possible climatic\ndifferences due to proximity to the sea, results from Japan and\nMalaysia were grouped into a separate group called Asian Is-\nlands (AI). The means of each group were compared using\nt-tests.\nLinear and polynomial regression analyses were also under-\ntaken to establish the best fitting descriptions of N and P con-\ncentration and N:P ratio in relation to climate (MAT, MAP)\nand latitude (LAT). The best fitting relationships were deter-\nmined as those with the highest correlation coefficient (r) and\nlowest p value. The statistical analyses were performed using\nExcel (Microsoft Corporation, USA) and SPSS (SPSS Inc.,\nUSA).\n3. RESULTS\n3.1. Leaf-litter N and P concentrations and the N:P\nratio\nThe mean N and P concentrations and N:P ratio of woody\nplant leaf-litter were 10.93 mg g\u22121 (n = 677, S D =\n6.48 mg g\u22121), 0.85 mg g\u22121 (n = 482, S D = 0.71 mg g\u22121)\nand 18.32 (n = 482, S D = 11.17) respectively (Tab.

The\nleaf-litter N concentration was significantly (p < 0.001) and\npositively correlated with that of P (r2 = 0.31) (Fig. 2).\nLeaf-litter N and P concentrations were significantly dif-\nferent between shrubs and conifers (p < 0.05) (Tab.

However, the P\nconcentration did show a significant decrease (p < 0.05) with\nMAT (Fig. 4E). The P concentration also showed (p < 0.01)\na concave quadratic relationship with MAP (Fig. 5E), and in-\ncreased (p < 0.05) linearly with LAT (Fig. 6E) (regression\nmodels are listed in Appendix S3 available online only at\nwww.afs-journal.org). For the shrub dataset, the N:P ratio var-\nied (p < 0.01) as a concave quadratic relationship with MAT\n(Fig. 4C), a positive (p < 0.01) linear relationship with MAP\n(Fig. 5C), and as a concave quadratic relationship with LAT\n(p < 0.01) (Fig. 6C).\nEach of the three tree datasets generally showed similar re-\nlationships as the global dataset.

Our study use a new dataset\nto establish the general patterns in N and P concentrations and\nN:P ratios in leaf-litter of woody plants at a global level, show-\ning some inconsistent results with previous studies. The mean\nnitrogen concentrations reported here for evergreen and decid-\nuous broadleaf trees (12.1\u201312.3 mg g\u22121) are higher than values\nof 9.6\u201310.3 mg g\u22121 reported by Yuan and Chen, (2009b). By\ncontrast the mean N concentration reported here for conifer\ntrees (6.69 mg g\u22121) is lower than that (7.9 mg g\u22121) reported\nby Yuan and Chen (2009b) (Tab. III). The P concentration for\ndeciduous broadleaves (0.9 mg g\u22121) and conifers (0.6 mg g\u22121)\nare similar in the two studies, although the value reported here\nfor evergreen broadleaves (0.84 mg g\u22121) is higher than that\n(0.5 mg g\u22121) reported by Yuan and Chen (2009b).\nAccording to Yuan and Chen (2009b), the N:P ratios of\nthe leaf-litter increased as one moves from boreal to temper-\nate, and then to Mediterranean and tropical forests (Tab. III).\nWithin this study, the N:P ratio also increased as the MAT\nincreased (Fig. 4C) and the highest ratios were found in the\n\u201cAsian Island\u201d and \u201cAfrica\u201d continental regions.\nIn the present study, mean leaf-litter N and P concentrations\nfor all woody plants combined were 10.93 mg g\u22121 and 0.85 mg\ng\u22121, respectively (Tab. I). These averages are 40% lower than\nN (18.3 mg g\u22121) and P (1.42 mg g\u22121) concentrations reported\nin a global study of live leaves (Reich and Oleksyn, 2004). The\nlower leaf-litter N and P concentrations result from resorption\nby the plants during leaf senescence. For example Yuan and\nChen (2009a) reported resorption efficiencies of about 47%\nfor nitrogen and 54% for phosphorus. Aerts (1996) reports a\nresorption efficiency of about 50% loss for both N and P.\n4.2. Global patterns of variation in leaf-litter N and P\nconcentrations\nLiu et al. (2006) found that across Europe and Asia, tree\nleaf-litter N concentration increased linearly with increasing\nMAT and MAP (r2 = 0.45, p < 0.001, n = 204). Yuan and\nChen (2009b) also found that at a global scale leaf-litter N\nincreased linearly with temperature and precipitation. Our re-\nsults on leaf-litter N (Figs. 4 and 5) support these two obser-\nvations. In addition, because mean temperature tends to de-\ncrease with increasing latitude, the above relationships means\nthat the leaf-litter N concentration tends to decrease with lati-\ntude at a global scale (Fig. 6). Hence we can conclude that lin-\near models are generally adequate for describing global varia-\ntions in leaf-litter N concentration. However at smaller scales,\nwhilst the positive response should still be evident, other re-\nlationships have been observed. For instance, Aerts (1997) re-\nported that leaf-litter N concentration followed a positive non-\nlinear relationship with actual evapotranspiration (AET) with\nthe data collected from temperate, Mediterranean and tropical\n811p6\nGlobal pattern of leaf litter nitrogen and phosphorus in woody plants Ann.

Berg\net al. (1995) established exponential functions (p < 0.001)\nbetween both N and P concentration and MAT and MAP for\nScots pine foliar litter across a small transect of MAT from\n\u20131.7 to 10.5 \u25e6C and MAP from 443 to 1 067 mm. Based on\nBerg\u2019s et al. (1995) data, Oleksyn et al. (2003) showed that for\nScots pine, leaf-litter N decreased with latitude across Euro-\npean continent.\nAcross the global dataset, leaf-litter P concentration showed\nno significant relationship with MAT at a global scale, al-\nthough a negative linear relationship was observed with shrubs\nand a concave quadratic relationship for deciduous broadleaf\ntrees (Fig. 4, Appendix S3). These results are not consis-\ntent with those of Yuan and Chen (2009b) who showed that\nsenesced-leaf P was negatively and significantly correlated\nwith MAT. Reich and Oleksyn (2004) also showed that P\nconcentrations of non-senesced leaves tended to decline with\nMAT. The low P concentrations at high temperatures has been\nrelated to the high abundance of low-P soils in the tropics due\nto low P weathering inputs (Chadwick et al., 1999; Walker and\nSyers, 1976), hydrologic losses of dissolved organic P (Hedin\net al., 2003), and sorption of P to soil surfaces (Crews et al.,\n1995; Walker and Syers, 1976). The resulting low level of soil\nP results in vegetation with lower P concentrations (Han et al.,\n2005; Reich, 2005; Reich and Oleksyn, 2004), and higher P re-\nsorption by senescing leaves (Yuan and Chen, 2009a). By con-\ntrast at high latitudes within a European study, Oleksyn et al.\n(2003) demonstrated that the P concentration of unscenesced\nScots pine needles remained relatively consistent at latitudes\nbetween 47 and 55\u25e6 N but there was a significant decline be-\ntween 63 and 65\u25e6 N. However because the relative level of P\nresorption by the tree increased steadily with latitude, the P\nconcentration of the leaf-litter also declined steadily between\n47 and 65\u25e6 N. In addition to these within-species effects, as\none moves from low to high latitudes, the abundance of leaf-\nlitter from evergreen broadleaf trees (which generally has a\nhigh P concentration) decreases and the abundance of conifer\ntrees (which tend to have a low P concentration) increases.\nHence within the global dataset the principal pattern of P con-\ncentration with latitude is of low values in the tropics and at\nhigh latitudes with higher values at mid-latitudes (Figs. 6B,\n6K, 6N).\n4.3. Global patterns of variation in leaf-litter N:P ratio\nOur results show that litter-leaf N:P ratio generally in-\ncreased linearly with MAT and MAP (Figs. 4 and 5). This is\nconsistent with the observations of Yuan and Chen (2009b),\nand can largely be attributed to the increases in leaf-litter N\nconcentration with MAT and MAP being greater than any as-\nsociated decline in P concentration. An increase in the N:P\nratio of unsenesced leaves with increased temperature has also\nbeen observed by Reich and Oleksyn (2004) and Han et al.\n(2005).\nIn terms of latitude, the highest N:P ratios tended to be\nat low latitudes with the lowest values at mid-latitudes, with\nsome evidence that N:P ratios start to increase slightly towards\n811p7\nAnn. For. Sci. 67 (2010) 811 H. Kang et al.\nthe highest latitudes. Again these results arise from the combi-\nnation of the general decline in N concentration with latitude\nbeing superimposed on a generally convex relationship be-\ntween P concentration and latitude. As explained earlier leaf-\nlitter P concentrations tend to be reduced near the equator due\nto low levels of soil P, and at high latitudes by low mineraliza-\ntion rates and relatively high rates of P resorption. Within this\nstudy this latitude effect only became apparent by the use of a\nnon-linear model (Fig. 6, Appendix S3).\n5. CONCLUSION\nBased on a global dataset different from previous ones, our\nresults support previous observations that leaf-litter N shows\na positive linear relationship with both MAT and MAP at a\nglobal scale. Although there was no significant relationship\nbetween P concentration and MAT, our analysis supports pre-\nvious observations that leaf-litter P can decline with MAP. The\nnet result of these is that the N:P ratio tends to increase with\nMAT and MAP. A key result is that the leaf-litter P concen-\ntration tended to show a convex relationship with latitude with\nthe highest values occurring at latitudes of between 25 and 50\u25e6.\nHence because the N concentration tends to decline with lati-\ntude, the greatest N:P ratios tend to occur at low latitudes, with\nthe lowest values at mid-latitudes before increasing slightly at\nthe highest latitudes. In addition, evident differences in leaf-\nlitter N and P concentrations exist among some continents or\nbetween the mainland and island in Asia area. These results\nare of clear importance in modeling biogeochemical cycling\nand particularly the probable responses of litter chemistry to\nglobal climate change.\nAcknowledgements: The first two authors, H.Z.
