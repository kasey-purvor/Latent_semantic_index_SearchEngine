This influence is frequently referred to as educational \nneocolonialism in the sense that Western paradigms tend to shape and influence educational \nsystems and thinking elsewhere through the process of globalization. Given the perceived \npressure to modernize and reform in order to attain high  international standards, educational \npolicy makers in non-Western countries tend to look to the West. Thus they may \u2018borrow\u2019 \npolicies and practices that were originally developed and operated, and which appeared to be \neffective, in a very different cultural context to that of their own societies. In effecting such \ntransfer, detailed consideration of particular aspects of the culture and heritage of the \noriginating country is often neglected. To illustrate some of the problems that result from this, \nthe article presents a case study of the application of Cooperative Learning, an educational \nmethod developed in the West, within an Asian context. Drawing upon Trompenaars and \nHampden-Turner\u2019s typology of seven cultural dimensions, our examination of Western method \nand eastern context reveals a complex web of cultural conflicts and mismatches. The paper \nconcludes by suggesting that non-Western cultures should seek to reconstruct imported \npedagogic practices in accordance with their own world views and in line with their own norms \nand values.  \n \nIntroduction \n \nThis article is written in response to a recent volume of Comparative Education [43(1), 2007] \nthat considered aspects of Western psychological and educational theory and practice in diverse \ncontexts. The main question addressed throughout was: \u2015Are Western educational theories and \npractices truly universal?\u2016. A recurring theme was that simplistic forms of \u2015transfer\u2016 of Western \napproaches to other contexts may often be inappropriate, and can potentially undermine existing \npractice. However, as noted in the editorial (Elliott & Grigorenko 2007), sensitivity to the \ndangers of inappropriate \u2015transfer\u2016 may be less evident in those contexts where policy-makers \nfeel strong pressure to introduce educational reforms. This can be exacerbated by powerful \ninternational agencies whose raft of financial incentives and inducements often exert a \nsignificant influence on practice. In sympathy with these observations, the present authors draw \nattention to Asian contexts where rapid reforms in education may run the risk of \u2015false \nuniversalism\u2016 involving the relatively uncritical adoption of various Western approaches. Rather \nthan examining this issue at the macro level, the paper focuses upon a particular educational \nmethod whose Western origins appear not to play out unproblematically in Asian contexts. \n \nThe paper examines how globalizing forces, in part promulgated by multilateral aid agencies \n(Tabulawa 2003) help to shape and influence the host educational system in ways aligned to \nWestern orthodoxies. In this context, the priority of policy-makers is not to have cognizance of \n2 \n \ncultural differences and national idiosyncrasies in driving reform, but rather to take a universalist \nperspective in relation to international standards, competitive league tables and comparative \nperformance indicators. To highlight the need for a more contextualized approach, and to \nillustrate how inappropriate \u2015cross-cultural cloning\u2016 can be, we shall highlight the difficulties of \nincorporating Cooperative Learning \u2013 seemingly, a specific Western approach \u2013 within a specific \nAsian context. The comparison will be undertaken using the seven-dimensional cultural \nframework of Trompenaars and Hampden-Turner (1997). Aspects of this form of pedagogic \ntransfer are examined from psychological, educational, as well as contextual perspectives and a \nnumber of difficulties are highlighted and discussed. The article concludes, however, by briefly \npointing out that Cooperative Learning is, in actuality, not a uniquely Western practice but, \nrather, also has foundations within longstanding Asian educational traditions. Unfortunately, this \ncultural asset is overlooked in the rapid process of reform and modernization. By adopting \nWestern theories and practices wholesale, and applying these in the classroom without rigorous \nresearch and consideration, the potential contribution of Asian education researchers has been \nlargely bypassed or discounted. The field is dominated by policy makers who lionise Western \npractices, who want quick results and who feel unable to await the outcome of systematic and \nlengthy research studies. As a result, there is an absence of the healthy scepticism and \nproblematising necessary when introducing any pedagogic initiative.  \n \n \nNeo-colonialism \nWhile, as we note below, Western societies have shown some interest in learning from the \neducational practices of non-Western nations, the historical legacy of colonialism is such that the \ndirection of cultural flow is largely uni-directional \u2013 \u2015from \u2017the West\u2018 to \u2017the Rest\u2018\u2016 (Rizvi, \n2004). As Crossley & Tikly (2004) observe, the vast majority of education systems that are \nexamined by scholars have their origins in the colonial era. Within the field of comparative \neducation there has been a resurgence of interest in postcolonialism [see, for example, \nComparative Education, 2004, 40(2)] not only because of the theoretical and intellectual insights \nthat this can provide but also because, for some societies, the postcolonial legacy has resulted in \neducational systems that, \u2015..remain elitist, lack relevance to local realities and are often at \nvariance with indigenous knowledge systems, values and beliefs\u2016 (Crossley & Tikly, 2003, p. \n149).   \n \nIn a general sense, \u2015neo-colonialism\u2016 is one element of the \u2017new imperialism\u2018 that reflects the \ninterests of Western nations and, more broadly, global capitalism Tikly (2004). Neo-colonialism \ninvolves a more subtle form of dominance than colonialism in that in the former the sovereignty \nof former colonized nations is recognized (Nkrumah 1965; Tikly 2004. The term refers not only \nto the continuation of past colonial practices but also explicit attempts by the colonizing nations \nto maintain their influence in their former territories (Altbach 1982). The means by which this is \nachieved is often economic. Thus, control is exercised by decisions to grant or to refuse loans \n(particularly those financing otherwise unpayable third world debt). Often decisions are taken by \nbilateral or multilateral institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the \nWorld Bank (WB). By tying funding to explicit conditions, these cartels of states can impose a \nparticular (Western) view of education and development on debt-receiving countries and \n3 \n \nreinforce neocolonialism by further limiting the capacity of these countries to determine their \nown educational agendas (Resnik 2006). In order to qualify for loans, and other forms of \neconomic aid, LDCs are required to make concessions and take certain steps favourable to the \ninterests of those aid agencies but which may be potentially detrimental to their own educational \ndevelopment. For example, as both Crossley (2001) and Tikly (2003) point out, the heavy \nemphasis placed by the WB and UNESCO upon primary education, at the expense of other \nlevels of education, removes the indigenous capacity for research and innovation which is \ncentrally important if countries are to link education to sustainable development and the \nconservation of cultural and educational heritage. In this context, the development of a pedagogy \nwhich aims to meet global (i.e. Western) requirements and international (i.e. Western) standards \ntends to militate against a pedagogy that aims to meld the prerequisites for effective learning \nwithin relevant parameters that typify a particular cultural niche.  \nIn many other parts of Asia, the legacy of colonial power can still unwittingly undermine or  \nnegate indigenous educational patterns, many of which are closely linked to cultural norms and \nvalues. In one study, Walker and Dimmock (2000) showed how the teacher appraisal model \ncurrently being implemented in Hong Kong, drew heavily on philosophies, procedures and \ninnovations dominant in Western countries. In particular, U.K. researchers were widely cited and \nthe models presented in the handbook appeared to clone approaches then in vogue in U.K. \nHowever, Hong Kong culture emphasises harmonious relations and the concept of face saving. \nThis can discourage open communication, self-criticism, and the use of direct feedback during \nthe appraisal process. For such reasons, Walker and Dimmock argue that the necessity for \nopenness and confidentiality, features central to Western appraisal models, may not fit neatly \nwithin the Hong Kong Chinese culture. In another study, Kwek (2003) criticized the desire of \nSingapore\u2018s national political and university leaders to refashion their two main universities as \nthe future \u2015Harvard and MIT of the East\u2016 by means of both rhetoric and the allocation of copious \nresources. Kwek claims that the attempt of university leaders and intellectuals in post-colonial \nSingapore to locate themselves from the periphery to the centre of research excellence fails to \nrecognise that their colonized mindsets will always situate them in the shadow of the West. \nConsequently, their vision of educational development and standards of knowledge production \nare based on Western epistemological schema and theories that are deeply rooted in, and \ninformed by, colonial thought (Wallerstain 1996). Often, Asian scholars seek to emulate the \nWest in a mimetic and uncritical way (Rahman 2000). They look to their Western former \ncolonizers for concepts and theories, technologies of teaching and learning, and innovative \nmethodologies for educational reform (Alatas, 2000) and seek publication of their research in \nWestern academic journals. Many Asians look westwards for intellectual sustenance and \ninspiration, for sabbaticals and exchange programmes, and Asian governments appear to take \npride in sending future educational leaders to study in overseas universities (Singh, 2004). Given \nthe continued hegemony of Western educational practices and theories, taught by Western \nexperts, it is unsurprising that international students return home with understandings and \norientations that are likely to support the maintenance and promulgation of a particularly \nEurocentric mode of education..  \nAdopting the Western education-economic growth discourse, educational reforms in a number of \nAsian countries have been conducted which, with economic development uppermost, perceives \neducation as largely fundamental to the socioeconomic infrastructure. Thus, in many ways, \neducation is not viewed so much as a right, a joy, a tool for liberation and empowerment, but, \n4 \n \nrather, as an investment (Brock-Utne 2000:12). Official literature in Viet Nam, for example, \nstates: \n \nThe basic task of renovation in education is to shift from meeting the needs of a subsidized, centrally planned \neconomy to meeting the needs of a multi-sector, state-managed, socialist oriented market economy \u2026 \nInvestment in education and training must be regarded as one of the main targets for development investment. \nConditions must be created to allow education to serve socio-economic development even more actively \n(Ministry of Education and Training 1995:14) \n \nAccepting the education-economic growth discourse, in exchange for financial aid, many Asian \ncountries have struggled to fulfill the concessions they made in order to receive the loans. \nReform and innovation are important at all levels of education, and radical changes are being \ncalled for in respect of aims, methodologies, pedagogies, programmes and curricula (Pham Lan \nHuong & Fry 2005). In this process of reform, the combination of both external drivers such as \nthe WB and ADB who shape and influence educational agendas by means of their funding, and \ninternal pressures to modernize the educational system, steer educational leaders in developing \nAsia once again to look westwards for models and examples. There appears to be a na\u00efve belief \namong many policymakers and practitioners that theories and practices that are perceived to be \nsuccessful in the West will prove equally effective in the context of Asia. Non-traditional \nmethods of teaching and learning that are believed to operate widely in Western countries \n(although, in actuality, these are less prevalent than is often realised), such as student-centered \nlearning or group learning, are thought to give a competitive edge and are considered to be \nfashionable and modern. Unfortunately, in the rush to adopt and import educational theories and \npractices based on Western thinking, cultural aspects of the pedagogy have often suffered serious \nneglect. Adopting policies across cultures without recognizing their distinctive social and \ncultural dimensions runs the risk of \u2015false universalism\u2016 (Rose 1991). Not only does this \nultimately impact upon the quality of student learning, it also provides the opportunity for mental \ncolonialism to continue and neocolonialism to triumph. \n \nSuch cherry-picking practices can, of course, also involve importation by Western countries. The \nearly 1990s saw the rise of the \u2017policy mechanics\u2018, those who believed that it was possible to \nidentify discrete teaching, and wider school practices, that were universally associated with \nstudent achievement (Fuller & Clarke 1994). Such individuals obtained a high profile within \nWestern policy-making circles and were ironically described as: \n \n\u2015\u2026. the academic community\u2018s jet-setting, high-tech, intellectual sharp-dressers\u2016 (Alexander 1996:6). \n \nThe gaze of the policy mechanics at this time was largely to the East. Following a series of \ninternational comparative studies, most influentially the Third International Mathematics and \nScience Study (Beaton et al. 1996a, b), policy makers in many Western countries sought to \ndiscover the reasons behind the impressive performance of countries in the Pacific Rim and some \nEastern European countries (cf. Reynolds & Farrell 1996). For a significant proportion of \ncommentators and scholars, a key factor centred upon the operation of the classroom dynamic. \nThus, for the U.K., Burghes (1999) advocated the importation of mathematics teaching methods \nfrom Hungary and Alexander (2000) has highlighted the potential of dialogic teaching that he \nobserved in Russia.  Similarly, Stevenson & Stigler (1992) and Stigler & Hiebert (1999) lauded \n5 \n \nwhole-class teaching in Japanese and Chinese classrooms as a highly active process that \ncontrasted with the passivity of many traditional U.S. classrooms. However, the importation of \n\u2015interactive whole-class teaching\u2016 into UK and US contexts has proven more complex than \nmany of its advocates had initially anticipated. Given that pedagogy is culturally embedded \nwithin broader socialisation practices (Miller & Goodnow 1995) and student behaviour is \nconditioned by influences outside of the classroom (Hopmann 2000) it is hardly surprising that \nhighly interactive whole class approaches that require significant levels of discipline, and a \nwillingness to subordinate each student\u2018s needs to those of the larger class group, have tended to \nprove problematic in the U.K. and U.S. Thus, direct importation of pedagogic practices are likely \nto be problematic whether East to West or West to East. \n \nIt is interesting to note that recognition of the dangers of cherry-picking is not a recent \nphenomenon (Sadler, 1900; Crossley, 1984). Indeed, Crossley (2006) observes that while \nscholars in comparative and international education have perhaps yielded the greatest insights \ninto educational differences across cultures, they have also been most critical of attempts to \nprovide simplistic implications for practice. Comparativists have long emphasised the need for \npolicymakers and researchers working across the social scences to be cognisant of culture and \ncontext in understanding educational developments (Broadfoot 1993; Crossley 1999; Crossley & \nJarvis 2001) and to recognise the folly of assuming that educational policy and practice can \neasily be transferred across cultures (Phillips & Ochs 2003). However, such messages are now \nincreasingly important given the ubiquity of international testing programmes, the pressures \nupon national governments to appear to be successful educationally, and the ease by which \ninformation about educational policy and practices around the globe can be accessed (Crossley & \nWatson 2003) \n \nWhile the authors of this paper are not claiming that the direction of pedagogic transfer is always \nfrom West to East, we do contend that the importation of \u2015new\u2016 pedagogies has tended to flow in \nthis direction largely because of historical and contemporary power differentials. The rationale \nbehind many current initiatives is that Western approaches are considered to be more likely to \nresult in greater creativity, an enhanced capacity for problem-solving and the inculcation of a \nmore entrepreneurial predisposition than traditional Eastern approaches which, it is often argued, \nfocus more upon inert knowledge acquisition by means of rote memorisation.  \n \nThe mismatch of Western knowledge in an eastern context - the case of Cooperative \nLearning in Asia \nIn the rest of the paper, we present a case study which seeks to illustrate the difficulties that can \nresult when a Western pedagogical method (in this case, cooperative learning) is applied without \nsensitive cultural modification to an Asian context. Particular reference is made to Confucian \nHeritage Cultures (CHC), which include China, Japan, Korea, Viet Nam, Hong Kong, Taiwan \nand Singapore. Of course, it is important that the very real differences between these countries \nare not overlooked, and that even experiences of colonisation have often been very different \n(Bray & Koo 2004)   \n \nCooperative Learning (CL) has its roots in Western social interdependence (Deutsch 1949) \ncognitive-developmental theory (Piaget 1950; Vygotsky 1978) and behavioural learning theories \n6 \n \n(Bandura 1977). The approach has proven to be highly successful with over 900 research studies \npointing to the effectiveness of cooperative over competitive and individualistic efforts (Johnson, \nJohnson & Stanne 2000). However, of the numerous studies that have attested to the benefits of \nCL, almost all have taken place in the West. In Asia, with exception of Japan, admiration for this \ntechnique is a relatively recent phenomenon, with the seminal work of Johnson and Johnson \nfrequently cited.  Despite the dearth of systematic research in the Asian context, CL is a key \npedagogic component of many education reform strategies.   \nOur case study reveals a series of cultural conflicts and mismatches with respect to the general \ncharacteristics\/consequences of Western models of CL and the norms, values and practices \nassociated with Asian culture. In order to fame our analysis we employ the cultural typology of \nTrompenaars and Hampden-Turner (1997) as a valuable parameter.  According to these authors, \nculture differs along seven dimensions: Universalism\u2013Particularism, Individualism\u2013\nCollectivism, Neutral\u2013Emotional, Specific\u2013Diffuse, Achievement\u2013Ascription, Attitude to times, \nand Attitude to environment. The first six of these dimensions are utilised in this paper to \nexamine some of the cultural problematics associated with the importation of CL into Asia.  \n \nThe first dimension: Universalism\u2013Particularism (Rules\u2013Relationship)  \nThis dimension is concerned with how we judge other people\u2018s behaviour towards each other. At \none extreme, we encounter an obligation to adhere to standards which are universally agreed by \nthe culture in which we live. Cultures at the universalism end of the dimension typically place a \nhigh emphasis upon rules, laws, equity and contracts that should be applied in all situations \nirrespective of personal relationships. At the other pole, particularism, an emphasis is placed \nupon the importance of relationships, to the particular obligations we may have to those we know \npersonally, and there is recognition that each situation should be treated differently. Western \ncultures tend to score high on Universalism whilst Asian cultures are often more associated with \nParticularism. In a comparative study by Trompenaars and Hampden-Turner (1997), respondents \nfrom South Korea, Nepal and China were among the five cultures scoring most highly on \nparticularism.    \nWith regard to this dimension, one relevant issue for discussion is that of reward allocation. \nHere, the primary question concerns how rewards should be allocated. Thus should a universal \nrule apply whereby everyone is treated equally and rewards are based on the individual\u2018s \ncontribution, or, according to an emphasis upon particularism, should other factors also be \ninvolved? Clearly, such a dilemma is of particular concern to those advocating collaborative \nactivities. \nThe two basic forms of reward allocation are those of equity (Adams 1965) and of equality \n(Deutsch 1975). The equity principle suggests that reward should be given proportionally as a \nfunction of each group member\u2018s contribution. The equality principle, which is underpinned by \nnotions of uniformity and fairness, holds that rewards should be provided equally to group \nmembers irrespective of their relative merits.  \n \nIn universalistic cultures, the emphasis on rules, regulations and guidelines tends to result in an \nevaluation system that specifies concrete achievement criteria upon which judgements are based \nand rewards allocated (Trompenaars & Hampden-Turner 1997). The equity principle is typically \n7 \n \napplied so that rewards are allocated according to the performance of each individual in \ncomparison with their peers. However, in Western educational contexts, CL is a case apart. Here, \nteachers seem to prefer the equality principle when grading group-related assignments; that is all \nstudents in the group receive the same grade irrespective of their individual contributions \n(Garfield 1993; Kagan 1992). The problem with this approach is that one or two members may \ncarry out most of the work and permit the others to progress with minimal contribution. In order \nto prevent this problem and to ensure a greater degree of fairness, transparent intra-group \nevaluation of CL has become popular in Western contexts (Ballantyne, Hughes, & Mylonas \n2002; Hanrahan & Isaacs 2001; Lejk & Wyvil 2001; Sluijsmans & Prins 2006). After each \ncollaborative task or project, group members are involved in a process of peer assessment \nwhereby each member is judged purely on the basis of his\/her individual contribution. A typical \nprocedure involves students providing confidential ratings that reflect how well they and each of \ntheir group mates have fulfilled their team responsibilities. Such ratings are typically taken from \na prescribed list ranging from \u2015excellent\u2016 to \u2015no show.\u2016 In accordance with the operation of the \nequality principle, this rating does not form part of the final group mark or grade; rather its \npurpose is to raise responsibility and heighten the participants\u2018 awareness of individual \naccountability. In this way, peer assessment is seen as a mechanism operating from a \nuniversalistic perspective of equity yet is one where reward is distributed according to an \nequality principle. Yet in a universalistic culture, this may still give rise to concerns that such \ngrading is unfair. For this reason, peer assessment frequently operates on the basis of equity. \nHere, the teacher assigns numerical values to each rating and computes a weighting factor for \neach member of the group by which each student\u2018s individual average rating is divided by the \nteam average. The student\u2018s final homework grade is the product of the weighting factor and the \noverall team project grade. However, this equity-based grading system runs counter to that \nsuggested by CL researchers. In short, a shared-group grade (equality) and an individual grade \n(equity) can be presented as two horns of a dilemma in a vicious circle as shown in Figure 1.  \n \n \nFIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE  \n \nWe would conclude that the equality norm advocated by Western CL researchers is likely to sit \nuneasily with the equity norm that prevails in universalistic cultures and this tension is best \nresolved by means of transparent intra-group peer assessment. \n \nIn contrast, in societies marked by particularism, the operation of the equity or equality principle \nis based on particular situations in which in-group\/out-group membership is an important factor \n(see further meta-analysis of Sama & Papamarcos 2000). Bond et al. (1982), Leung and Bond \n(1984) found that Hong Kong students tend to use the equality principle in close in-groups, such \nas among friends and relatives, but the equity principle when dealing with out-groups, such as \nstrangers. Such fluctuation suggests that the reward allocation preference of Asian students may \ndepend on the particular nature of various cooperative relationships. We can predict different \nperceptions of grade-related fairness on the basis of a student\u2018s partners in a CL context: with \nstrangers, with students from other schools, with fellow students from the same school or the \nsame class, with acquaintances, or with friends of differing levels of intimacy. The second factor \nthat influences grade allocation is personality. An Asian allocator may elect not to penalize a \n8 \n \npoor contributor should that person be seen as possessing some personal asset that is valued. \nPrevious research (Chi Yue Chiu 1989) on Hong Kong students found that when recipients' \nperformance was poor and their personality was perceived as desirable, the allocator tended to \ngive them the same amount of reward as a person who had a high performance and a less \nattractive personality. A third factor of relevance here is past and future interaction. Zang (2001) \nargues that for Chinese students, past relationships, and expectations about future relationships in \nthe long\/short-term, will exert an influence on students\u2018 decisions concerning grade allocation. \nThe third factor that influences reward allocation is seniority. Bowman (1986), Exall (1985), \nLincoln (1989) report that seniority is a relatively pervasive determinant of allocation behavior \namong Japanese. Other factors that are likely to impact here are traditional values as shown \namong Hong Kong students in the study of Lin et al. (2007) or special needs, as well as \nparticular circumstances that one cannot easily predict. The use of a shared group grade \nsuggested by Western CL researchers is, therefore, likely to prove problematic in particularistic \ncultures.  \nWhen the allocation of grades cannot simply be based on a universal rule of equality, the use of \npeer assessment becomes controversial. In universalistic cultures, all students can be evaluated, \nindeed, should be evaluated, according to clear guidelines with minimal use of exceptions. In \nparticularistic cultures, judgments are often based upon the specific nature of present \ncircumstances (Trompenaars & Hampden-Turner 1997). A particular student, subject to peer \nassessment, may be considered not just as a group member but as \u2015my class mate\u2016 or \u2015my close \nfriend\u2016. Furthermore, the student\u2018s evaluation may be influenced on the grounds that he or she is \n\u2015my neighbour\u2016, or because \u2015my father knows his\/her father\u2016, or even because, \u2015our family has a \nhistory of disagreements with his\/her family\u2016. In each situation, members of the group will be of \nunique importance to the individual, with a special history of positive and negative relationships. \nIn such circumstances, a guiding principle is that one must therefore sustain, protect or discount \nthis person no matter what the assessment rules say.    \nIn short, when CL is applied to an Asian cultural context, there is a potential mismatch between \nthe operation of an assessment method underpinned by a universalistic principle of equality-\nbased grade allocation in a context where which intra-group relationships have significant \ninfluence.  \nThe second dimension: Individualism \u2013 Collectivism  \nThe second dimension in the Trompenaars and Hampden-Turner typology concerns a well-\nestablished cross-cultural tension (Hofstede 2003; Triandis 1995) between what one desires as an \nindividual and one sense of obligation to see the interests of the group that one belongs to. While \nit is an error to be too sweeping in offering cultural generalizations (Elliott & Tudge 2007) it is \nfair to state that most Western cultures are associated with individualism whereas most Asian \ncultures are identified with collectivism. Here, important issues for establishing cooperation in \nlearning centre upon trust and identity. Key questions are: \u2015Should our trust be based on the \nprofessional competence of our partner or, alternatively, on the emotional bond between us?\u2016 \nand \u2015How far should group identity be related to individual identity?\u2016.  \nBoth trust and identity are recognized as important antecedents to cooperation. Trust concerns an \nindividual\u2018s confidence in the goodwill of others in a relationship and the expectation that others \n9 \n \nwill reciprocate if one cooperates (Kramer & Tyler 1996; Smith, Carrol & Ashfold 1995). \nMcAllister (1995) differentiates between two types of trust: cognition-based and affect-based. \nThe former is linked to the individual\u2018s knowledge and role performance while the latter is \nderived from the emotional bonds that exist between group members. Trust is culturally \ndetermined (Strong & Weber 1998). Chen et al. (1998) suggests that cognition-based trust will \nbe more closely linked to cooperation in an individualistic culture while affect-based trust will be \nmore important in collectivist contexts. In individualistic societies, the development of trust \nresults from experiences where people faithfully adhere to their respective roles, responsibilities \nand share outcomes equitably. In contrast, those in collectivistic societies may be more \ninfluenced by their personal loyalty and attachment to significant others. For example, Sullivan \nand Peterson (1982, cited in Huff & Kelly 2005) speak of the Japanese concept wa, a quality of a \nrelationship involving cooperation, sharing, warmth, and fellowship leading to trust. Similarly, \nFarh, Earley and Lin (1997) suggest that in China and Viet Nam, relationships and ties in a \ncompany\u2018s culture are more important than the enactment of specific organizational practices. \nGroup identity is a factor that can radically affect cooperation (Aram 1993; Dawes, Orbell, & \nvan de Kragt 1990). However, because prior studies have largely taken place in predominantly \nindividualistic cultures, studies on group identity have yielded inconsistent findings (Chen & \nTriandis 1996).  Chen et al. (1998) argue that group membership on the basis of one\u2018s school, \ngeographical origin, or family name, carries stronger psychological attachment for collectivists \nthan for individualists. Hence, these authors suggest that membership of certain in-groups is \nmore likely to trigger a sense of mutual identification that will help to foster emerging \ncooperation. Note that for collectivists, social identities are more salient than personal identities, \nwhereas for individualists the reverse is true. Thus, it is likely that for individualists, a new group \nidentity will offer a means to enhance personal identities, but for collectivists, it is likely to \nenhance pre-existing group identities, such as those built upon friendship, kinship, or geographic \norigin (Chen et al. 1998).   \nThe two concepts trust and group identity have a close relationship since a critical condition for \ntrust is identification with the group (Brodt & Korsgaard 2003). In other words, trust is largely \ndetermined by the extent to which individuals define themselves in terms of particular group \nmembership. To have a positive effect on cooperation, trust and identity should be synergized in \nwhatever way is optimal. Thus, for collectivists the new group should provide sufficient affect-\nbased trust and at the same time support an identity which complements other social identities \nand collective interests. In contrast, for individualists, the new group should guarantee cognition-\nbased trust, while, at the same time enhance personal identity and instrumental and rational self-\ninterest.  \n \nIn an educational context, group structure will often be an important factor in developing trust \nand identity. Research has strongly suggested that a heterogeneous group in respect of learning \nability is optimal for CL (Hooper & Hannafin 1991; Kagan 1992: 6:4; Lew et al. 1986; \nDillenbourg & Schneider 1995; Veldhuis-Diermanse 2002). In relation to cognitive ability, the \npreferred grouping normally consists of one high achiever, one low achiever and two average \nachievers. This reflects a position that each group will have equal opportunities to learn as long \nas each group member acts in accordance with their assigned responsibilities. Although there are \nresearch suggesting that heterogeneous groups may also discourage interaction due to the \n10 \n \nabsence of ties between group members (Heilesen et al. 2002), and that group should be \ncomposed by individuals who know each other well in order to stimulate the cooperative process \n(Lockhorst 2004), this line of research on the role of intimacy and social closeness in CL group \ncomposition is poorly touched. In general, it is suggested that students should not be allowed to \nform groups based on existing friendships or cliques (i.e. an affinity grouping). \nHowever, the form of grouping recommended by CL theorists and practitioners, emphasising \ncognitive rather than affective factors, is indicative of a neglect of a cultural perspective with a \nseeming mismatch between evidence from intercultural\/organizational studies and CL\u2018s \napplication in educational contexts. If personal relationships play a more powerful role in \ndetermining the nature of group collaboration, personal affinity, rather than ability, may be a \nmore significant factor to consider when establishing optimal grouping in collectivist societies. \nSuch a position similarly applies if members in these societies are highly motivated to achieve a \ngiven task because of their sense of personal loyalty and attachment to significant others in the \ngroup (affect-based trust), This suggestion is supported by the work of Fauzan (2002:108) who \napplied a method called Realistic Mathematics Education in Indonesia \u2212 a collective culture with \na strong emphasis on in-group cohesion. In Fauzan\u2018s experiment, students initially formed \ngroups on the basis of cognitive ability. This led to some problems since boys and girls do not \nnormally work or play together. Fauzan subsequently permitted them to form their own groups.  \nStudent work-rate increased, largely it was assumed, because they felt more secure in a \nfriendship-based environment. In similar vein, Phuong-Mai et al. (2007) report that Vietnamese \nstudents expressed a strong preference for working in friendship groups, believing that this \nallowed them to benefit from the closeness that already exists among group members. This \npreference typically remains even when all members of the group are low achievers, as students \nbelieve that an able learner does not necessarily guarantee group success and what is more \nimportant is the more powerful sense of intellectual confidence and satisfaction that results from \nworking with close associates with whom one shares a sense of group loyalty.   \nThe third dimension: Affective  \u2013 Neutral \nThe fourth dimension: Specific \u2013 Diffuse \n \nThe third dimension concerns the ways in which the nature of our interactions is expressed, \nwhether we are demonstrative of our feelings (affective) or are more emotionally controlled and \ndetached (neutral). The fourth dimension also deals with communication and is concerned with \ncommunicative style, whether one tends to go \u2015straight to the point\u2016 (specific) or is expected   \nfirstly to \u2015beat around the bush\u2016 (diffuse). The former style of communication \n(affective\/specific) is commonly found in many Western cultures where people attempt to find \nimmediate outlets for their feelings, the mass of information is expressed very explicitly and \nproblems are expected to be directly and openly dealt with in an objective fashion. The latter \nmodes of communication (neutral\/diffuse) are more common in Asian cultures where people \ntend not to telegraph their feelings but keep them carefully controlled and subdued, and very \nlittle information is explicitly communicated. In these cultures, the problem is approached is a \ndiffuse manner and group harmony may often be prioritized at the expense of reaching a final \nagreement (Hall 1976; Hoftede 2003; Trompenaars & Hampden-Turner 1997).    \n \n11 \n \nThe communicative features of Western cultures provide a basis for Western-based researchers \nto construct CL methods that emphasize \u2015face-to-face promotive interaction\u2016 (Johnson & \nJohnson 1994:58). Here, group members are motivated to challenge each other\u2018s conclusions and \nreasoning, influence each other\u2018s efforts, strive for mutual benefit, and maintain a moderate level \nof emotional arousal. Differences of opinion are seen as providing valuable opportunities for \nproductive discussion. Since emotion can be openly exhibited yet can be detached from \n\u2015objective\u2016 and \u2015rational\u2016 decision making, disagreement and conflict can be made explicit  \nwithout giving offence or hurting personal feelings.  \n \nIn contrast, the strong emphasis in Asian culture upon ensuring \u2015harmony\u2016 and \u2015face\u2016 suggests \nthe need for a very different group dynamic and forms of communication in, for example, \nChinese (Liu 2002; Wen & Clement 2003) and Japanese contexts (Yashima 2002). Being seen as \nmodest and self-effacing, rather than \u2015blowing your own trumpet\u2016 is perceived as praiseworthy, \nwhile wasting other students\u2018 time by expressing independent judgments is often perceived as \nbragging and reflective of an egotistical and selfish personality. In Chinese classroom, the \nforthright expression of one\u2018s views in a challenging fashion may lead others to lose face \n(Kennedy 2002). Students in many \u2015\u2026traditional CHC cultures are not encouraged to speak out, \nto question or to criticize, to reflect or act independently, nor to organize their ideas in a logical \nand linear manner\u2016 (Jones 1999). Thus, Chinese learners have an approach to learning which \navoids them directly expressing a point of view (Connor 1996). In class, Chinese learners are \noften unwilling to commit themselves publicly for fear of losing face, or leading others to lose \nface (Jackson 2002; Tsui 1996). In one study (Woodrow, 2006), those from Japanese, Korean \nand Chinese backgrounds tended to be anxious in speaking out although this proved to be less of \nan issue for Vietnamese students.  \n \nResearchers have found that while conflict management has been shown in the West to \ncontribute to team effectiveness (Jehn & Mannix 2001; Lovelace, Shapiro & Weingart 2001), its \nvalue does not extend equally to Asia (Leung 1997). Differences of ideas and opinions may not \nbe seen as a springboard for vigorous debate but rather as a threat to group harmony. \nConsequently, in order to maintain a harmonious group relationship and avoid the loss of face, \nwhen conflicts ensue, Asian students are likely to opt for more indirect responses. These may \ninvolve \u2015avoidance\u2016, bypassing the topic of conflict or being \u2015obliging\u2016, reflecting greater \nconcern for the other\u2018s interest than one\u2018s own (Jehn & Weldon 1992; Kirkbride, Tang & \nWestwood 1991; Tse, Francis & Walls 1994). Another form of conflict resolution widely used in \nAsia is mediation (Ting-Toomey et al. 2000). In order to \u2015give face to\u2016 the mediator (e.g. the \ngroup leader or teacher), both parties in a dispute may be willing to make a concession, as a form \nof honouring this high-status individual (Wall & Blum 1991). \n \nOnce again, we are confronted by important cultural considerations. Those seeking to apply \nWestern-based forms of CL in Asian contexts need to consider how to reconcile the interpersonal \nassumptions of Western group methods with the social mores of other contexts where \u2015harmony\u2016 \nis supreme, expression is subdued and explicit differences of opinion are to be avoided. We \nwould argue that unless adaptation or an appropriate form of reconciliation is made, one cannot \nexpect debate among Asian students to result in productivity, fruitfulness, or the strengthening of \ninterpersonal relationships. \n12 \n \n \nThe fifth dimension: Achievement \u2013 Ascription   \nThis dimension refers to how one\u2018s status is judged, on the basis of what one has done \n(achievement) or on who one is (ascription). In the context of CL, one key issue related to status, \nour particular focus of comparison here, is \u2015leadership\u2016.   \nResearch has shown that effective leadership processes tend to reflect the culture in which they \nare located (Jackofsky, Slocum, & McQuaid 1988; Ronen & Shenkar 1985; Smith & Peterson \n1988; Triandis 1993). In many Western cultures, the best leader is often considered to be the \n\u2015one-minute leader\u2016 who communicates clear goals, and delegates decisions and tasks in ways \nthat will ensure that the job gets done (Maccoby 1994). Consequently, in CL, teachers typically \ndescribe the main task of a leader as being responsible for keeping the team on the assigned task \nat hand, encouraging all members to participate, and ensuring that everyone has mastered the \nlearning points of a group exercise (Millis 1996). Team members\u2018 respect for their leaders tends \nto ebb and flow according to what he or she has done to achieve the team\u2018s goal. A leader is \nexpected to separate work and personal issues, and it is usually considered that the team should \nbe managed according to agreed rules and regulations with little or no personal exceptions. \nIn many Asian cultures, however, leadership is emphasises management of people rather more \nthan management of work, a phenomenon exemplified by the expression \u2015reciprocally \nhumanitarian leadership\u2016 with \u2015relationship\u2016 being particularly emphasized (Chang 1976; Hui & \nLin 1996; Lee 2001). A good leader mirrors a good father\/older brother who performs by moral \nexample and expresses responsibility and care for subordinates. Consequently, the requirements \nfor good leadership are seen to be more related to one\u2018s personality. Ideal qualities include \ndemonstration of virtue and morality, a capacity for maintaining good relationships, and an \nability to ensure that group members behave in ways accepted as moral and decent (Gunning \n1997). These qualities must be demonstrated in order to win the confidence of team members. In \nturn, the leader will usually receive a high degree of loyalty and devotion from them. In this way, \ndignity, kindness and devotion, rather than work-related competence, are likely to be the key \ncriteria for leadership. Thus, Phuong-Mai et al. (2007) report that high school students in Viet \nNam largely chose their group leader on the basis of personality (who s\/he is) rather than on that \nof academic achievement (what s\/he has done). The students showed strong preference for a \nleader who was capable of bringing comfort to team members and maintaining group harmony. \nAt the same time students confirmed that an excellent study record was not a sufficient \nqualification for selection as group leader.  \nThe above discussion demonstrates that students may perceive the role and requirement of \nleadership very differently across cultures. By adopting notions of leadership as described by \nWestern-based educationalists, the operation of an effective group dynamic may be hindered  \nand group learning and productivity subsequently reduced.  \nThe sixth dimension: Attitude towards time \nAccording to Trompenaars and Hampden-Turner (1997), how people think of time relates \nclosely to how they plan, strategise and co-ordinate activities with others. In some cultures, \nsequential time, (i.e. where it is divided in linear segments) is dominant. In others, synchronic \n13 \n \ntime is more prevalent. Here, one\u2018s sense of time is informed by communal bonding activities. \nThis definition resonates with what Hall (1983) distinguishes as monochromic\u2013time (M-time) \nand polychromic-time (P-time). M-time cultures tend to emphasize clock time, schedules, \nappointments, promptness. Time is tangible and can be \u2015saved, spent, wasted, lost, made up and \nrun out\u2016 (Hall 1983:43). Individuals in M-time tend to focus on doing one thing at a time, \nseparate instrumental activities from socio-emotional activities, and sacrifice personal interaction \nto the perceived imperatives of scheduling and efficiency.  \nIn comparison, P-time cultures tend to emphasize the experiential rhythms of time with priority \ngiven to relationships rather that \u2015artificial\u2016 clock time. They are more likely to intertwine socio-\nemotional activities with instrumental, task-based activities, and seek to undertake a number of \nactivities in parallel (Hall 1983). Time is a concept governed by the smooth implicit rhythms that \nresult from interactions between people. It is our servant and tool and is adjusted to suit our \nneeds. The arbitrary division of clock time or calendar time holds little meaning if the rhythms of \npersonal relationships go \u2015out of sync\u2016. Time is limitless and unquantifiable; there is always \nmore time. Wessel (2003) states that P-time people change plans and deadlines frequently and \nconsider schedules as goals rather than as imperatives. However, problems can result, for \nexample, when having to cope with inflexible deadlines, P-time mentality can jeopardize \ncooperation.  \nThis spectrum also relates to differences in the approach to, and timing of, learning tasks. In \nAsian cultures where P-time is more prevalent, a study schedule may not be followed as planned. \nIt is not that the passage of time is unimportant or that one\u2018s learning capacity is impaired, but \nrather that several other factors intrude.  While students in M-time cultures may typically want to \ncomplete the task as quickly as possible, Asian students may feel compelled to give time to \n(unplanned) activities or to people with whom they have a particular relationship. They may also \ntake more time to get to know their learning partners and to build group trust before commencing \nthe task. An interesting example can be found in a study of cooperative working between Dutch \nand Hong Kong students (Vogel et al. 2000).  Figure 2 illustrates the differing periods that the \ntwo groups maximized their efforts.  \n \nFIGURE 2 ABOUT HERE \n \nThe Hong Kong students found it more difficult to cope with the pressure of time constraints that \npushed them to work harder. The Dutch tended to start out enthusiastically, suggesting schedules \nfor the joint assignment. However, many were disappointed with the limited initial input from \nthe Hong Kong students who, at this time probably still needed time to get to know their \npartners. This resulted in a dip in the Dutch students\u2018 commitment to the project. Towards the \nend of the project, the work rate of the Dutch students rose once more because of the pressure of \ndeadlines. At the same time, that of the Hong Kong students also increased, even higher than that \nof their partners, because, it seemed that at this point they had established satisfactory trust with \ntheir Dutch partners and were ready to cooperate. However, the M-time framework did not work \nfor these P-time students; the moment that they were maximally geared for cooperation came just \nbefore the deadline, somewhat too late for the fruitful completion of the task. \n \nDiffering conceptions of time affect the quality of bonds between group members. For students \nin P-time cultures, relationships tend to be seen more in instrumental terms. The focus upon \n14 \n \ndiscrete time intervals also seems to be advantageous for the separation of means from ends, in \nthat the relationship among members grouped together in CL is not wholly entered into for its \nown sake but, also, in order to pursue individual study goals. This is the reason why Western-\nbased CL researchers recommend that the structure of groups should keep changing throughout \nthe school year in order that no student would work in the same group on a large number of tasks \n(Kagan 1992, 6:4).  \nFor Asian students, relationships combine past, present and future with ties of affection and \nmemory. The relationship is its own justification and is enjoyed as a form of durable \ncompanionship extending both far back and far forward. In an investigation by Phuong-Mai et al. \n(submitted), Vietnamese teachers reported that the CL approach is primarily meant to promote \nexisting group solidarity and to prepare students to have mutual responsibility for their future \nlives. Such perspectives highlight an interesting distinction. CL initially attracted attention in the \nWest largely because of its potential to raise academic achievement, while in the East it is likely \nperceived as a vehicle to reinforce relationships, with its impact upon cognitive achievement \nusually being seen as less important. Thus, frequent changes of grouping, as suggested by Kagan \nmay be less appropriate for Asian school contexts.  \nGeneral discussion   \nGraves (cited in Shwalb & Shwalb 1995) offers an interesting observation that the use of CL has \nbecome most widespread in cultures where one might anticipate that it would be least welcomed \n(Western individualistic cultures), and least common in places where it should have been most \nwelcomed (Asian or African collectivist cultures). In fact, despite the successes widely recorded \nin Western educational publications (Johnson, Johnson and Stanne 2005), the application of CL \nin non-Western contexts has not always proven productive or culturally appropriate (Phuong-\nMai et al. 2006). Messier (2003) finding is likely to have confused and disappointed many Asian \neducational leaders. Studying 145 Chinese middle school students, it was found that those \nfollowing a programme of traditional lecture-based learning obtained higher achievement scores \nthan those pursuing cooperative learning. It was concluded that integrating Western methods \ninto an Eastern educational programme has a number of problems, particularly when this is \ninitiated by researchers who are biased by their (Western) culture, by their training as Western-\nstyle scientists, or by their association with Western colleagues (Shwalb & Shwalb 1995).   \nHowever, while the origins of CL are closely associated with Western theorists, it is misleading \nto suggest that small group learning approaches do not exist in Asia. For example, the traditional \nAsian family and most Asian social institutions exemplify the modern principles of group \nbuilding. As the economist, Astorga (2002) sardonically observes: \n \u2015...the West has developed an ingenious way to package and operationalize a concept and practice that \nobviously has traces of Eastern fingerprints all over it. Long before Kurt Lewin tinkered with group \ndynamics in the 40\u2018s at MIT, Lao Tzu (Confucius) and his assistants over twenty six centuries ago were \nalready extolling the virtues of collaboration and group effort complete with a veneration for life, nature \nand space. For the most part, credit and accolade are now ascribed to Lewin especially when groups and \ncollective behaviours are talked about.\u2016 \nClearly, making use of collective brain power in learning is not a new phenomenon in Asia. Tang \n(1996) observes that it has been normal practice for Chinese students to form study groups \n15 \n \noutside the classroom to help each other with home work and other learning tasks. Similarly in \nViet Nam, h\u1ecdc nh\u00f3m (learning in a group) has always been common among students. Such \nactivity typically takes place in a home location most convenient to all. In both these cases, \nlearning takes place without any prior instruction or advice from teachers. Rather, students \nsimply perceive a need to work together, such spontaneous collaboration typically being \norchestrated outside of the classroom. It is, perhaps, unfortunate that, influenced greatly by \nWestern trends, some Asian educational leaders have failed to recognize that the foundation of \nCL already exists within existing educational traditions. In the rush to reform and modernise, \nnew innovative Western methods are enthusiastically adopted, while, at the same time, our own \ncultural heritage is neglected and opportunities to develop and research a CL method that is \nunique to, and culturally appropriate for, Asian students are missed   \nConclusion \nThe analysis in this paper addresses issues of neo-colonialism in education: the inappropriate \nwholesale adoption of Western educational theories and practices. Through examination of the \noperation of CL in Asian contexts, we have highlighted the potential for mismatch when \neducational approaches are transferred across cultures without sufficient consideration of the \nnorms and values of the host society. Cross-cultural cloning, increasingly fuelled by Western-\noriented globalization, may result in academic ineffectiveness, serious neglect of cultural assets, \nweakening of the host culture\u2018s own research capacity and at the same time, may help to \nperpetuate a sense of dependency on the part of formerly colonized host cultures. In order not to \nfall prey to such outcomes, it is important that such countries resist being swamped by colonial \nand neocolonial influences emanating from the West and look to their own cultural and social \nvalues and practices.  \n \n\u2015Resistance to Eurocentricism, and hence development, can only come from non-Western concepts and \ncategories. The non-Western cultures and civilizations have to reconstruct themselves, almost brick by brick, \nin accordance with their own world views and according to their own norms and values. This means that the \nnon-west has to create a whole new body of knowledge, rediscover its lost and suppressed intellectual \nheritage, and shape a host of new disciplines\u2016 (Sarda 1999, 57). \n \nHowever, there is a danger that once a bandwagon has begun to roll, once governments have \nbecome politically and financially committed to moving in a certain direction, once educational \nleaders have bought wholesale into the promise of \u2017modern\u2018 pedagogical methods and have \nbecome preoccupied with international standards, such movement is difficult to reverse. For this \nreason, more than ever before, comparative research that locates educational practices within a \nspecific culture, at the level of classroom, school and system (Elliott & Hufton 2003) is needed. \nOnly by comparison can we reveal, alongside each culture\u2018s particular mix of uniqueness, \nheritage, values and practices, powerful continuities which transcend time and location \n(Alexander 2001).   \n \n  \n16 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1- Peer assessment in universalistic cultures: tensions of equality and equity.  \n \n \n          \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2- The contribution rate of Dutch and Hong Kong students. \n17 \n \nReferences \nAdams, J.
