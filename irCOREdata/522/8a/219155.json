The book is structured around discussion of \nfour \u2018political evils\u2019: genocide and crimes against humanity; global poverty; \nstatelessness; and neoliberal globalization. Hayden uses Arendt\u2019s work to explain why \neach should be classified as evil and, occasionally, what we might do to confront \nthem.  \n \nBefore setting out a theoretical and empirical analysis of each evil, Hayden sensibly \nbegins with a justification of his use of the vocabulary of \u2018evil\u2019. He recognises that \nreaders may be put off by his use of this term in preference to more conventional \ncontemporary concepts such as injustice or harm, but argues that \u2018evil\u2019 is an \nindispensible idea as it signifies acts which, following George Kateb, \u2018deserve the \nutmost condemnation\u2019 (p2). \u2018Political evil\u2019, for Hayden, is found in acts which \nobliterate personhood \u2013 which render human beings, humanity and the political \nsuperfluous. The four evils discussed in the book are linked by the fact that each \nrenders some category of people, or the political sphere more broadly, superfluous. \nThey do so, however, in different ways, and it is here that Arendt\u2019s contribution is \nparticularly interesting. There is much literature (particularly that concerning \ngenocide) on radical evil, or the atrocious acts of supposedly evil individuals, but little \nthat uses a framing of banal evil to explore harm generated through structures. Arendt \ndid not understand evil in modernity as a supernatural phenomenon, or as manifesting \nfor the most part in deviant individuals, but as an all-too-common property of \nstructures. Hayden demonstrates that political evil does not just take the form of direct \nviolence, but also appears in indirect or structural violence which debases the human \nstatus by denying humans a home, resources, equal standing and political recognition \n\u2013 in short, by making humans superfluous. The chapters on global poverty and on \nstatelessness demonstrate very well the dangers of sovereignty, capitalism and rule by \nbureaucracy, with the discussion of contemporary asylum policies standing out as \nparticularly powerful. Hayden provides good reason to think that complacency in the \nface of global poverty or statelessness is equally as unacceptable as complacency in \nthe face of genocide, as all are manifestations of evil. While the vocabulary of evil \nstill carries too much theological baggage and suggestion of maniacal intent for many \nreaders to accept its use here to describe the more mundane and, for the most part \n(one hopes), unintended harms of poverty and statelessness, and while the claim that \nevil defines the self-understanding of our age is something of a stretch, the framing of \nthe book around political evils does serve to emphasize disconcerting connections \nbetween seemingly discrete forms of severe injustice. \n \nHayden outlines effectively the most important contributions Arendt has to make to \ncontemporary international political theory, and does so with reference to her full \nbody of work instead of just one or two key texts. He shows why we must understand \n\u2018human\u2019 as a political rather than biological status, why we should develop our \ncapacities for good judgment and guard against thoughtlessness, and why we should \nchallenge those systems \u2013 in particular sovereignty and neo-liberalism \u2013 which cause \nmuch more suffering than many of us are prepared to admit, yet are much less \nentrenched or natural than they are generally portrayed to be. Arendt\u2019s work has great \nrelevance in entreating us to focus less on individual acts and more on the effects of \nideologies and organisations in developing solutions to the most urgent issues of our \nage. \n  \nUnlike some other recent work in this field, Hayden also makes a concerted attempt to \nbridge the gap between Arendt\u2019s writing in the post-war period and the international \npolitical theory of the late twentieth and early twenty-first century. He generates a \nconversation between Arendt and thinkers as diverse as Thomas Pogge, Michel \nFoucault and Ulrich Beck which, while at times frustratingly brief, does show how \nArendt can be used to support, enrich or extend a range of more well-known \npositions.  \n \nWhere the book disappoints is the lack of political engagement and concrete \nsuggestions for transformation that an Arendtian position would seem to entail. \nHayden is convincing in his condemnation of the four political evils he discusses, but \noffers little by way of alternatives. Early in the book he outlines a \u2018realistic \ncosmopolitanism\u2019 which he sees as necessitated by the contemporary conditions we \nface, not least the appearance of \u2018humanity\u2019 as a discrete political category, and he \ngoes some way towards explaining what such a cosmopolitanism would require. \nHowever he does not engage in any depth with the variety of cosmopolitanisms that \nhave appeared in international theory in the last decade, nor justify why his realistic \ncosmopolitanism is preferable to, for instance, Toni Erskine\u2019s \u2018embedded \ncosmopolitanism\u2019, Andrew Dobson\u2019s \u2018thick cosmopolitanism\u2019, Kwame Anthony \nAppiah\u2019s \u2018rooted cosmopolitanism\u2019 and the like. Much more could have been said to \nsubstantiate the position Hayden develops through Beck and Arendt which claims \ncosmopolitanism not as a truth about the world but as an unpredictable and uncertain \nprocess, which we should take a principled political (rather than philosophical) \ndecision to align ourselves to. Nor does he intervene in political debates about \nwhether and how the grave injustices inherent in the sovereign state system and the \nglobal neo-liberal economic system can be overcome. Even if one accepts that these \nsystems can be overthrown, there is little point in doing so unless a convincing case \ncan be made that other types of political and economic organisation would result in \nless \u2018evil\u2019. \n \nHayden describes his purpose in this engaging book as to make an innovative \ncontribution to the emerging literature linking Arendt to international political theory \nand debates around globalization. In outlining, however briefly, a \u2018realistic \ncosmopolitanism\u2019 and using Arendt to challenge the existing order and the \u2018evils\u2019 \nwhich result from it, he succeeds in his aim and provides a sound basis for further \nwork on how we can use Arendtian ideas to reject the status quo, reconceptualise \nfreedom and rejuvenate the political sphere.  \n \nKirsten Ainley, London School of Economics, UK  \n"}
