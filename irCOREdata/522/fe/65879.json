It \nreally can change peoples\u2019 lives for the better \u2013especially the lives of those who need it most\u201d \n(Kofi Annan, UN Secretary General, 18 November 2004). \n \n \n2005 had been declared the \u2018International Year of Microcredit\u2019 by the United Nations. \nThis declaration was a demonstration of support from the world community of the \nimportance of microcredit for overall economic development. Governments, NGOs, the \nprivate sector and the media had been invited by the UN to highlight the role of \nmicrocredit and microfinance in poverty reduction. The target of reaching 100 million \nimpoverished people (especially women) with credit by 2005 (Microcredit Summit, \n1997) had once again attracted world-wide attention for the tool of microfinance. As a \nbuild up, therefore, to the year of microcredit, evaluation of microfinance programs had \nattracted much attention as an increasingly important aspect of development activity.  \nAgencies, and particularly aid donors, have all sought to ensure that funds are well \nspent (Eversole, 2003; Hulme, 2000), and thereby prove that microcredit activities \nreduce poverty (Gulli and Berger, 1999).  \n \nConsequently, accountability and justification are distinctive features of microfinance \ntoday. Despite demonstrated successes in reaching some of the poor in providing credit \n(Hulme and Mosley, 1996; Morduch, 2000), the poorest remain beyond many \nmicrofinance institutions\u2019 reach (Ahmad, 2000; Ito, 1999) and this has required \nparticular \u2013often economic- explanation.1 Such evaluation research therefore reflects an  \n\u2018economic bias\u2019 in its impact assessment of microcredit on poverty (Copestake, et al., \n2000, 2002; Hulme and Mosley, 1996, 1998); outreach to the poor (Gjerding, 2002; \n                                                 \n1 Economic models from an institutional perspective have used transaction costs and show that these are too \nhigh for the poor (Bhatt and Tang, 1998; North, 1990), sociologists have looked at social capital and the role of \nnetworks Coleman, 1990; Portes, 1998; Woolcock, 1998, 2001), while anthropologists have pointed to cultural \nfactors (Mayoux, 1999, 2001). \ns:\\staff\\dro - durham research online\\fulltext\\departments\\business school\\4288\\journal article-acforum.doc 4\nHulme, 2000; Navajas et al., 2000); and empowerment of women (Goetz, 2001; \nKabeer, 2001; Mayoux, 2001; Rahman, 1999a). \n \n \nReplications of lending methodologies and issues such as, client\/borrower exit from \ncredit programs have been studied with a view to improve service delivery (Hulme and \nMosley, 1996; Hulme, 2000; Pal, 1999; Wilson, 2001). In short, evaluations of \nmicrofinance programs have hitherto been dominated by a concern with impact \nassessment, program replication, client outreach and financial sustainability. \n \nWhile relevant to understanding microfinance, and also attractive to donors, such \nresearch nevertheless neglects the processes of microfinance at work and puts more \nemphasis upon its original strategy than subsequent implementation. Research \nparticularly neglects field workers or loan officers (Ahmad, 2000; Goetz, 2001, 1997) \nand their interface with poor people (Holcombe, 1995; Jackson, 1997). A number of \nissues and problems concerned with the work loan officers actually do at the most \ncritical interface have arguably not been sufficiently addressed before, which are \npotentially critical for frontier territory like Zambia, where microfinance still needs to \nprogress from simply promising beginnings. Loan officers are the major link between \nmicrofinance institutions (MFIs) and their poor clients and are central for service \ndelivery (Ahmad, 2002; Goetz, 2001). Because they mediate transactions between \nMFIs and borrowers, loan officers are thought to implement policies of MFIs in ways \nthat imply in-depth understanding of clients and empathy for successful lending \n(Ahmad, 2002; Chua, 1998; Goetz, 2001; Holcombe, 1995; Jain and Moore, 2003; \nPawlak, 2002). In short, it is argued that \u201cthe heart of MFI lies with its fieldworkers\u201d \n(Chua, 1998), yet that argument has not really been fully examined. \n \nLoan officers face tensions and challenges because of conflicting expectations between \nclients and MFIs, accentuated by inability to enforce joint liability and social sanctions \nin group based lending methodologies (Jain, 1996; MKNelly and Kevane, 2002; Matin, \n2000; Vogeldesang, 2003). The dilemmas between fulfilling their client \u2018nurturing\u2019 \nroles which call for the use of time and social skills as opposed to the other tasks \nassigned by their home MFIs are not necessarily easily resolved. So far there has been \nlittle research into how loan officers adapt to these situations and what effects these \ns:\\staff\\dro - durham research online\\fulltext\\departments\\business school\\4288\\journal article-acforum.doc 5\nadaptations then have. There are particular questions about how each actor within the \nlending process uses the existing relations to further their interests in a given context. \nFor example, how do these interactions between clients, loan officers and their \nmanagement shape MFI performance? Such questions are important because the \nactions of loan officers have substantial and sometimes unexpected and unintended \nconsequences for the actual direction and outcome of many credit programs. The \nfollowing sections therefore review the literature on loan officers\u2019 work within \nmicrofinance, describe the context to the study, the MFI selected and the research \nmethods used, and resulting research findings. The study concludes by considering why \nthe implementation of group based lending programs can prove so unexpectedly \nproblematic especially where the lending process so depends upon appropriate social \nrelationships and becomes flawed when these are not suitably developed. \n \nFieldworkers: A Brief Review \nAmong the few empirical studies of loan officers\/field workers are those of Ahmad \n(2000) and Goetz (2001) based on the MFIs in Bangladesh moving from a pioneering \nto developing stage where high repayment rates are considered a notably \u2018heroic' \noutcome of their continuing progress. Goetz (2001) for example, explores the question \nof institutional change from the point of view of women fieldworkers and their role in \npromoting gender equality within a microcredit program among poor women. These \nfield workers were critical to communicating policy changes to borrowers and \nresponsible for effecting the \u2018fit\u2019 between top-level policy \u2018initiatives\u2019 and local \n\u2018realities\u2019. They operated under particular pressure to secure high rates of repayment as \ntheir institutions sought financial sustainability, and were assessed primarily on the \nbasis of their credit-delivery performance. Findings in other countries have been similar \n(Ito, 2003; Rahman, 1999b; Reinke, 1998; Schreiner, 1999). Goetz concluded that the \nimportance and influence of field workers was in principle reflected in whether and \nhow they reconciled their organisations\u2019 goals with their own personal preferences. Ito \n(2003) observed that field workers with diverse roles faced the rival demands between \nincreasing loan disbursement and repayment as compared with borrowers\u2019 requirements \nto be sensitive to their own specific circumstances and requirements.  \n \nAhmad (2000, 2002) also argued that the microfinance literature has evaluated the \nactivities of Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) without sufficient reference to \ns:\\staff\\dro - durham research online\\fulltext\\departments\\business school\\4288\\journal article-acforum.doc 6\nthe views of those who actually work with clients. Like Goetz (2001) Ahmad (2000) \nalso found field workers to be implementers of policies but were nevertheless \norganisationally dis-empowered. \u2018Very little research has been conducted on the field \nworkers in both the North and South and yet, it\u2019s the strength of field workers, which \nensures the smooth functioning of the MFIs\u2019 (Ahmad, 2000: 64). Both Ahmad and \nGoetz (op cit) argued that the practices and perspectives of field workers themselves \nwere under researched. Outside South Asia, little knowledge exists about their actual \nroles within the group lending programs. Understanding of the loan officers\u2019 roles \nwithin the credit lending process in Southern Africa is particularly limited to findings \nbased on MFIs in South Asia and also from general studies on impact assessment of \nmicrocredit programmes, client exit surveys, outreach of MFIs and group dynamics. \n \nThe focus of this study is on loan officers in MFIs in Zambia and how they adapt to the \nrespective demands of MFIs and their clients, as illustrated by how one emerging MFI-\nCETZAM- managed its own repayment crisis. It finds that loan officers pressured to \naccount for their activities and recover money pursued strategies that called for them to \n\u2018manage emotions\u2019 in such a way as to increase the sense of shame among defaulters, \nthereby weakening their groups\u2019 mutual guarantee even further. The strategies pursued \nby CETZAM in dealing with widespread \u2018delinquency\u2019 (a term actually used by the \ninstitution themselves when referring to those defaulting on mutually assured loans) are \nfound to be of a short term in nature and potentially detrimental to outreach and \nsustainability. Such an approach, coupled with a poor national credit culture, weak \ngovernance rules, mistrust and competition from other MFIs ultimately weakened \nCETZAM\u2019s trust bank methodology. \u2018Delinquency\u2019 turns not only on the lending \npolicies and costs of the program but also on the nature and extent of social relations (a) \namong clients in groups, (b) between clients and loan officers and (c) between loan \nofficers and management. This is significant given the \u2018benchmarks\u2019 now used \nregarding microfinance performance and a bias towards reporting \u2018excellent\u2019 loan \nrepayment rates of 98 per cent and above among \u2018successful\u2019 mature MFIs elsewhere. \nSuch benchmarks may conceal the underlying problems of MFIs in early stages of \ndevelopment unless these further issues are recognised and resolved. \n \ns:\\staff\\dro - durham research online\\fulltext\\departments\\business school\\4288\\journal article-acforum.doc 7\nThe Zambian Context and the CETZAM\u2019s Case \n Microfinance in Zambia is relatively young and has operated without a distinct legal \nand regulatory framework until recently (Dixon, et al., forthcoming).2 The sector \nemerged in the 1990s (Maimbo and Mavrotas, 2003; Musona, 2004) and is largely \ndonor driven, with an urban concentration. By September 1999, there were nearly thirty \norganisations engaged in MFI activities (Maimbo and Mavrotas, 2003). Currently, it is \nestimated that there are twenty established MFIs (AMIZ membership list, 2003)3, most \nof which are either inactive or quite localised and small compared to other MFIs in \nSouth Asia and East Africa. Despite their numbers outreach remains low in relation to \nthe potential \u2018market\u2019, and the scope of services is likewise limited, mostly to \nmicrocredit with little savings mobilisation. Like MFIs in Kenya (Johnson et al., 2003), \nZambian MFIs face relatively high levels of delinquency and default, high operating \ncosts, slow intake and high client exits which constrain their efforts to achieve the \nfinancial and organisational sustainability now considered so important. Indeed, most \nare now faced with challenges of \u2018good governance\u2019 (given their NGO status) and often \nstruggle to maintain high repayment rates.  \n \nCETZAM is funded by the British Department for International Development (DFID) \nand is one of Zambia\u2019s best known microfinance institutions.  Its headquarters are in \nKitwe (Copperbelt province) and was founded in 1995 as an NGO driven by Christian \nprinciples to \u2018transform the lives of the poor\u2019 by \u2018providing opportunities to create \nemployment and generate income through credit and training services\u2019 (Field notes, \n2004). Its first loans were disbursed in July 1998, and DFID agreed to provide \u00a32.29 \nmillion in financial support for a five-year period starting February 1998 (Copestake, \n2002). CETZAM expects its clients will become agents of transformation4 within their \ncommunities (CETZAM CEO, Nov. 2003) where \u2018transformation\u2019, may be economic, \nsocial, spiritual or political in scope. CETZAM therefore originally anticipated its loan \n                                                 \n2 The Bank of Zambia has finalised the regulatory framework that would allow some MFIs to mobilise savings, \nbut more importantly, establish governance rules (that have been non-existent hitherto) and formal \naccountability channels with the central bank.  \n3 AMIZ stands for the Association of Microfinance Institutions of Zambia. Most of the MFIs are affiliated to \nAMIZ, including CETZAM.  \n4 Opportunity International Network defines \u2018transformation\u2019 as a \u2018deeply rooted positive change in beliefs, \nvalues, attitudes, actions, relationships and structures manifested in a higher level of existence of an individual \nand\/or community\u2019 (Cheston, S. et al., 2000). \ns:\\staff\\dro - durham research online\\fulltext\\departments\\business school\\4288\\journal article-acforum.doc 8\nofficers as having a transformational role with poor clients, but this research will \nquestion how transforming their relationship has been. \n \nCETZAM expressly uses a group-based poverty lending methodology specially \nintended to target the poorest of the economically active population-especially women \n(CETZAM brochure, 2001). To qualify for a loan, a borrower needs no physical \ncollateral, but must belong to a joint-liability credit group, as is the practice with most \ngroup lending methodologies (Dixon, et al., forthcoming). A loan officer\u2019s intended \nrole is to assess the eligibility of potential clients, visit their businesses, and train them \nin CETZAM\u2019s lending methodology -including some basic book keeping skills- for ten \nweeks before disbursing loans to them. Trust Banks are thus supposed to become \ntightly knit self-support groups with the ability to transform their lives and \ncommunities. Self-selection of group members is a major element of the methodology \ntogether with joint mutual guarantees (Bastelaer, 1999; Matin, 2000). In addition, group \nlending programs operate in a way that the work of screening, monitoring, and \nenforcement of repayment are to a large extent progressively transferred from the \nMFI\u2019s agent (loan officer) to the group members themselves (Hermes, et al., 2005, \nMarr, 2002; Rhyne, 2001; Sharma and Zeller, 1997). Several observers have addressed \nthe perceived advantages of such collective action in the actual screening of loan \napplicants and monitoring of borrowers (Bhatt and Tang, 2001; Besley and Coate, \n1995; MkNelly and Kevane, 2002; Morduch, 1999; Navajas, et al., 2003; Reinke, 1998; \nRhyne, 2001; Stiglitz 1990; Varian, 1990). One main argument is that group members \ncan obtain, at low cost, an understanding of the reputation and indebtedness of the loan \napplicant and their efforts to ensure repayment (Bastelaer, 1999) and thereby \u2018socially \nobligate\u2019, rather than formally compel, that repayment. \nThe principle behind these groups is that they will be readily mobilized, cost effective, \nand boost repayment rates through an enforcement mechanism where group members \ncan use social sanctions against their defaulting members, offer a screening function (to \navoid forming groups with risky borrowers), and thus co-guarantee any loans. This \njoint-liability mechanism, it is argued, has been a major methodological breakthrough \nfor lending to the poor (Ahmad, 2002; Bhatt and Tang, 2001; Goetz, 2001; Hulme and \nMosley, 1996; Ito, 2003; Rahman, 1999a). However, there is mixed evidence on actual \n\u2018enforcement\u2019 of joint liability, and several authors observe that, while issues of joint \ns:\\staff\\dro - durham research online\\fulltext\\departments\\business school\\4288\\journal article-acforum.doc 9\nliability are widely discussed in weekly meetings, it is not always \u2018enforced\u2019, making \nthe intended shared responsibility difficult if not impossible to realize (Ito, 1999, 2003; \nJain, 1996; Jain and Moore, 2003; MkNelly and Kevane, 2002; Pal, 1999; Rahman, \n1999a; Schreiner, 1999; Vogelgesang, 2003). \n \n          Research Methodology  \nThe study is based on a period of intensive qualitative research conducted in late 2003 \nbased on the researcher\u2019s \u2018indigenous knowledge\u2019 of the local context and culture as \nwell as extensive prior local field experience. It was not originally intended to be a \nstudy of CETZAM and its \u2018delinquency\u2019 crisis. Rather the researcher set out to explore \nthe emerging role of loan officers in MFIs providing credit to the poor (especially \nwomen). CETZAM was originally selected for study as a successful model (Copestake, \net al., 2002).5 The problem of \u2018delinquency\u2019 at CETZAM was therefore not known \nprior to the study but later emerged in an iterative way while field work continued. A \ncombination of observations, semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions and \ninformal discussions with loan officers, clients, immediate supervisors and senior \nmanagement were used in the study. \n \nIn all 20 formal interviews were conducted, tape recorded and subsequently transcribed, \neach lasting between forty-five minutes to one and half hours.6 A semi-structured \ninterview approach was taken using broad open ended questions in order to encourage \nthe interviewees\u2019 own interpretations of everyday actions (Maykut and Morehouse, \n1994). This approach is intended to empower interviewees, enabling them to speak in \ntheir own \u201cvoices\u201d (LIewellyn, 2001) and a degree of freedom to explain their thoughts \nand highlight any areas of particular interest. While the interview guide imposed some \nstructure on each interview, the researcher ensured that it was the interviewees\u2019 \nperspectives being gained and therefore the guide was not used in an overly \n                                                 \n5 CETZAM has 5 branches on the copperbelt, 1 branch was picked (for detailed study) that had the highest \nnumber of loan officers (5), with range of 2-4 years of service. All the loan officers were interviewed and \nobserved. This also meant interviewing the branch accountant and manager as well. This branch is typical of the \nother 4 branches.  \n \n6 Most interviews with clients could not be tape recorded (6 out of 9) due to noises at their trading premises and \nwere also not comfortable with the recording machine. Detailed notes were written up immediately after these \ninterviews. 3 senior managers, 2 immediate supervisors (at branch level), 1 former loan officer, 3 clients and 6 \nloan officers made up the 15 recorded interviews. \ns:\\staff\\dro - durham research online\\fulltext\\departments\\business school\\4288\\journal article-acforum.doc 10\nconstraining manner (Patton, 1990). The one-to-one interviews with loan officers were \nsupplemented with a semi-structured questionnaire which addressed the personal \nbackground of loan officers, reasons for seeking employment with the organisation, \nknowledge of their organisation\u2019s client target, aims and services provided. Access to \ninternal reports at branch level (though very limited) added meaning to the interview \ndata with loan officers. \nAccess to internal meetings was granted by the branch manager on condition that tapes \nand notes were not taken during the meetings. Twelve morning review meetings of loan \nofficers and their immediate supervisor were observed in situ (Dixon, et al., \nforthcoming). This method was found to serve the purpose of exposing the meanings, \nperceptions and interactions from an insider\u2019s perspective and gave context to the other \ndata that could not be accessed through interviews alone. The researcher also \naccompanied loan officers in the field to capture the \u2018oral\u2019 character of microfinance \nand observe the process as it occurred. In order to capture a grassroots view of loan \nofficers in the field, the researcher attended six trust bank group meetings to observe \nthe interactions between loan officers and clients, and noted their reactions. Observed \ncontradictions were followed up and clarifications obtained through informal interviews \nand conversations. Field notes were written up soon after meetings and at the end of \neach day. Focus group discussions with clients and loan officers were held (separately) \nto gain their perceptions about microfinance in practice (Bryman, 2001; Krueger, 1994) \nwhile other data was collected by observably \u2018being around\u2019 (Rahman and Goddard, \n1998, p. 187). \n \nBy focusing on the actors\u2019 own interpretation and subjectivity, this field study therefore \nsought to find how the actors involved in the lending process made sense of situations \nand everyday practices. Consequently, the style of research required for this purpose \nwas a grounded theory approach to the process of microfinance of an interpretive \ncharacter (Morgan and Smircich, 1980; Miles and Huberman, 1984 in Hoque, et al., \n2004, p.61; Silverman, 2000). The intention was to capture the \u2018ambiguities, tensions \nand contradictions\u2019 in the \u2018messiness\u2019 of a loan officers\u2019 work and also specifically \nbring out the emotional and social character of microfinance in action. It also helped the \nresearcher interpret how loan officers brought the MFI and their clients together. This \nlink between documents, interviews, questionnaires and observations is referred to as \nthe degree of correspondence (or lack thereof) between what people [loan officers] say- \ns:\\staff\\dro - durham research online\\fulltext\\departments\\business school\\4288\\journal article-acforum.doc 11\ntheir \u2018espoused theory\u2019-and what they actually did- \u2018theory in action\u2019 (Argyris and \nSchon, 1978 in Collier, 2001 p. 471). It is therefore this triangulation of data that \nprovided a check for internal validity of the results of the study.  \n             \nThe Founding Phase \nA synopsis of CETZAM\u2019s first six years of operation- July 1998 to December 2003 \nreveals its impressive start considering the near collapse that followed five years after \nthose first loans. Even in its initial phase it faced pressures of expansion, then later had \nto deal with the problems of \u2018delinquency\u2019 in order to survive, an issue that dominated \nthe period of this research. CETZAM was the first of the \u2018new wave\u2019 minimalist \nmicrocredit organisations and originally claimed great success (in terms of client \noutreach), then recording repayment rates of 98 per cent and over (Copestake, 2002; \nCopestake, et al., 2000), with low percentages of Portfolio at Risk7 (PAR), and \nPortfolio in Arrears. This founding \u2018success story\u2019 led to a massive client outreach \ndrive (see fig. 1) that was partly driven by outside donors  as well as itself as together \nthey envisaged conversion of CETZAM into a registered bank with a network of at \nleast 20 branches serving 50,000 clients by 2005 (Cheston, et al., 2000). CETZAM \nexpanded its outreach to about 9,390 active clients and five branches by year 2000,8 \nand had by all standards exceeded all original grant targets (Copestake, et al., (2000). \nAs Figure One shows, the numbers of borrowers started small, rose quickly, \napproaching 16,135 by 2002, but then fell dramatically to 5,382 by the end of 2003. \nNotwithstanding the success CETZAM achieved over those six years of its operation, it \nbore symptoms of crisis that its new chief executive officer (the third in 7 years) said: \n\u2018It is a pity you have come at such a time when the organisation is going through a very rough \npatch. CETZAM is being restructured and things are not good and work is hectic as we try to put \nthe organisation back on its feet\u2019. CETZAM has experienced declining client membership, low \nrepayment rates and rising percentages of PAR (Interview with CEO-5\/11\/03).  \nBy the end of 2003, PAR thirty days and over stood at 30 per cent (the set target being \n5 per cent), while the percentage of portfolio in arrears at thirty days and over was 22 \n                                                 \n7 PAR is a measure of loan quality that considers not just missed repayments of delinquent clients, but the \nremaining outstanding balance of loans, which are at risk of not being repaid. The determination of when a loan \nis at risk is based on the age of the arrears and can vary among MFIs. A \u2018cut-off\u2019 of 30 days is usually the norm. \n8 For CETZAM, active clients are clients with loans appearing on the aging analysis, while inactive clients are \nthose on recess, or on orientation, or waiting for a re-loan. Clients in arrears are those with delinquent loans but \nare within the loan cycle, which has not expired. Overdue clients are defined as clients with loans that are out of \nloan cycle but still owing money (CETZAM Memo- CET\/482\/SHZ\/03. Dated: 6\/5\/03, accessed 21\/11\/03). \ns:\\staff\\dro - durham research online\\fulltext\\departments\\business school\\4288\\journal article-acforum.doc 12\nper cent (see Fig. 2). In part the high arrears rate may be associated with the rapid \ngrowth of the institution when screening, evaluation, and monitoring of loans may have \nbeen weakened by the relatively abundant availability of funds.9 From the clients\u2019 \nperspective, the perception of CETZAM as an NGO [and] using external funds may \nhave created an incentive to default.  Loan disbursement in the year 2003 fell to \nminimal levels due to PAR related problems.  \n                  \n770\n2,266\n9390\n13,327\n16,135\n5,382\n0\n2000\n4000\n6000\n8000\n10000\n12000\n14000\n16000\n18000\n1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003\nYear\nN\no.\n o\nf c\nlie\nnt\ns\n Figure 1 Number of borrowing clients from July.1998-Dec. 2003 \n Source: Dixon, et al., forthcoming. \n \nBy the end of 2001, CETZAM had opened twelve branches (most not eventually \nsustainable), employed eighty-five loan officers who operated under the \u2018pressures of \nexpansion\u2019, (Cheston, et al., 2000), and had a large number of clients.

There was also a lack of timely and accurate \ninformation that made the program vulnerable to potential staff fraud (Field notes \n2003). By mid 2003, CETZAM decided to write off thousands of clients as \u2018bad debts\u2019 \nand loan officers became focused on \u2018pressures of delinquency\u2019. As a result, CETZAM \nreduced its branches from twelve to seven and loan officers from 85 to 28 (see table \nOne) while this study was in progress.  \nIronically, its quarterly loan disbursements increased up to 2002 (see fig. 3) and \nthereafter declined as the organisation stood at the verge of its potential collapse10, \namid widespread default and other rumours of unethical behaviour.

By December \n2003, this fell to 825 clients (others being \u2018written off\u2019), and loan officers reduced to \nfive from seven. Interviews with loan officers and branch manager and close \nobservations in the field revealed there were different perspectives about the problems \nat hand (see box 1):  \n   \n   BOX 1 \n \n \n \n \n \nLoan officers\u2019 views \nThe problem is not just with us loan officers. Management is to blame as well as they had put us under \npressure to form groups. We were just fighting to have groups so that we reach targets within a short period \nof time. So we started compromising. People, oh, I mean loan officers just started getting anyone and not \nthe economically active. So when money was given to them it was hallelujah!! They [clients] didn\u2019t bother \nto pay. But the end result was disastrous and we paid dearly as most loans were just written off in the end. \nThat is why even our donors wanted to withdraw (LO 1). \n \nAt times we loan officers don\u2019t visit clients\u2019 businesses before the loan appraisals, but just sit in the office \nand the loans come out. So some clients may not even have businesses and defaulting becomes inevitable \n(LO 2). \n \n The cornerstone of microcredit in CETZAM is the methodology and we have to follow it. But there are \ns:\\staff\\dro - durham research online\\fulltext\\departments\\business school\\4288\\journal article-acforum.doc 16\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Loan Officer\u2019s Position  \n \nOne internal document listed the loan officers\u2019 key formal responsibilities as: \nMarketing CETZAM products and services to clients, explain CETZAM lending \npolicies and procedures, facilitate group formation, train clients on CETZAM \nmethodology, facilitate timely loan disbursements, monitor usage of loan funds and \nmake follow ups with clients to ensure timely repayment, engage in delinquency \nmanagement with clients who are failing to make repayments on time and also \nimplement transformational activities aimed at empowering all clients.  \n \nFormally loan officers then report directly to the branch manager and indirectly to the \noperations manager. In view of their many roles, one head office manager described \nloan officers as having a \u2018transformational role\u2019 where the organisation expects them to \nbe \u2018change agents\u2019 as they interact with clients. That loan officers are key to the success \nof microfinance and have: \nA very difficult job to do in that they carry with them the financial services CETZAM provides to \nthe client, the vision of the organisation and their personality.  All these factors are quite difficult \nto handle. In addition, there are expectations from the organisation and clients that we need to \nbalance with (Interview-26\/11\/03, Kitwe). \nIn a group discussion, loan officers alternatively themselves claimed that: \ns:\\staff\\dro - durham research online\\fulltext\\departments\\business school\\4288\\journal article-acforum.doc 17\nWe are mediators, agents, front-liners and key players. Loan officers are seen as providers from \nthe clients\u2019 perspective and as deliverers of services on behalf of organisation.  So a loan officer is \nexpected to meet the demands of the clients who expect loan officers to be understanding and \nquick with loan disbursement while the organisation expects targets to be met (FGD-21\/11\/03). \n \nThe point loan officers are making here is that they link clients with the MFIs through \ndaily interaction (Jackson, 1997; Reinke, 1998). As Schreiner (1999) states, \n\u2018microfinance rests on personal relationships, in particular, that between the loan officer \nand the borrower.\u2019 However these \u2018affective ties\u2019 are constructed in the presence of \ndivergent expectations and can be emotion laden. Evidence suggested that loan officer-\nclient interactions and relationships were complicated by conflicting expectations as \nwell as the targets set (for example, zero arrears) that consequently impacted on all \nrelations concerned with \u2018delinquency\u2019. One loan officer said: \nBut management and donors do not understand the realities on the ground. Most of them up there \n[management] have not been in the field, never formed and managed a trust bank to have a feel of \nwhat it takes to mobilize people and ensure loans are repaid, while keeping clients loyal and \nmotivated.  \n           Another indicated:  \n\u201cOur job is about meeting targets and management does not want to hear any other story. But the \nproblem is that these expectations keep pulling us in different directions\u201d.  \nSuch disparate demands and tensions at the client-loan officer interface, loan officer \nand management within the broader demands of the MFI are captured in Figure 4. \nFig. 4 Framing the tensions and conflicting demands within microfinance \n \n                                                                        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                       \n                      \n \n \n  MICROFINANCE \n   MANAGEMENT \n \n \nL\/Os \n    \n   DONORS \nExerting pressure on MFIs to: \n- Achieve sustainability.        \n-Demand internal accountability. \n-Maximise client outreach\/volume \n-Use tested lending methodologies   \nHow has the \nloan officer \nadapted?   \nTensions: Balancing the \nrequirements\/expectations of \nthe donors and poor clients \nwithin the existing hierarchical \npower relationships. \ns:\\staff\\dro - durham research online\\fulltext\\departments\\business school\\4288\\journal article-acforum.doc 18\n                                                                    \n                                                                             \n \n \n  \n               \n                                                                            \n                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n \n                                            \nSource: Author- 2004 \n \nProblems occurred at four levels. First, the MFI had to balance donors\u2019 requirements \nand expectations with those of the poor. Donors became more focused on internal \nefficiency and tangible, reported results. As a result, the MFI must contend with \npressures from donors to prove they are providing better services while using fewer \nresources to do so. Problems should therefore be seen in the light of existing unequal \npower relations between the two. Second, problems are expected between loan officers \nand management of the MFI as loan officers face powerful hierarchical accountability \npressures and offset MFIs expectations against clients\u2019, as if to imply they were simply \n\u2018caught in the middle\u2019. At a third level, problems arise between loan officers and clients \nas peer pressure within groups does not induce good repayment, forcing accountable \nloan officers to use other informal means. Under these circumstances, tensions rise \nbetween loan officers and borrowers as loan officers begin to absorb tasks that, in the \noriginal model, groups themselves ought to do, especially loan accounting work and \n \nCLIENTS OF MFIs \nTensions: Clients expect loan \nofficers to be flexible (\u2018bend\u2019 \nrules) and sympathetic to their \npersonal circumstances with \nsome \u2018pastoral\u2019 care. \n \nMeet institutional \ntargets: loan repayments \nand disbursement, client \nload &formation of \ngroups, and thereby \naccount for group\u2019s \nperformance \nTensions: Expected \nto balance the \nexpectations of the \nMFI and those of \nthe clients. \nInfluence clients \nto meet the given \ntasks\nTensions as clients resist change and \ncertain aspects of the group \nmethodology, such as the use of mutual \nguarantee, resulting in weak group \naccountability and problematic \nrelationships. \ns:\\staff\\dro - durham research online\\fulltext\\departments\\business school\\4288\\journal article-acforum.doc 19\nrecoveries. The fourth level of problems occurred within the clients\u2019 groups due to their \ninability to enforce the mutual guarantee. All this occurs amid increasing mistrust and \nsecrecy regarding credit related matters. Such sensitivity could offend clients if loan \nofficers for example followed them to their own homes, particularly in a Zambian \ncontext where microfinance is still in its infancy. The problem of \u2018delinquency\u2019 should \ntherefore be understood from that perspective, coupled with loan officers\u2019 position that: \n\u2018we are everything\u2019 and have jobs to protect. \n \n\u2018Delinquency\u2019 and Loan Officers\u2019 Adaptation \nLoan officers did not necessarily follow the officially stated lending procedures. For \ninstance, the Trust bank size was reduced to 15 from 20 plus, and the formal orientation \nperiod of 10 weeks was not strictly adhered to, and client\u2019s businesses were not visited \nbefore disbursing loans. Officers also reprioritized their work to recover money in \narrears and consequently sidelined other key roles such as marketing the product, \nfacilitating the formation of groups (outreach), proper client orientation and timely loan \ndisbursement  (frustrating \u2018good\u2019 clients). \n Loan officers pointed to a lack of shared understanding of the \u2018realities on the ground\u2019 \nregarding poor clients. This created suspicion within management and reciprocal \nfrustration on the part of loan officers who, on the one hand, were being asked to be \nassertive in collection, and on the other hand, trust bank members expected them to be \npatient and understanding. Enforcing loan repayment at \u2018Wesu\u2019 branch was \nproblematic, because CETZAM did not have a clear mandate to prosecute defaulters. \nJohnson et al (2003) report similar difficulties in handling defaulters at one of the MFIs \nin Kenya, but the difference is that, in this case, CETZAM and not the defaulting client \nbore the costs. The original intention was that the borrower progressively takes over the \nlender\u2019s responsibilities for monitoring group repayment behaviour, taking action, if \nnecessary, to enforce repayment (Ito, 2003). These arrangements were supposed to free \nthe loan officer for other constructive activities. However, loan officers devoted more \ntime and effort to chasing up defaulters, and not initial loan disbursement or new group \nmobilisation, knowing that group enforcement of joint- liability was weak and \nineffective.  \n  \nWhile CETZAM management claimed to be aware of such problems, they did not \nespouse clear strategies to solve it. As a result loan officers actively pursued defaulters \ns:\\staff\\dro - durham research online\\fulltext\\departments\\business school\\4288\\journal article-acforum.doc 20\n(a task meant for group leaders) instead of building networks that would enable mutual \nguarantees (Copestake, et al., 2001; Ito, 2003). Members typically valued harmony \nmore than alternative social sanctions. This is in line with findings by Paxton (1996) in \nBurkina Faso, where borrower groups applied little ex post pressure for the same \nreasons (quoted in MKNelly and Kevane, 2003: 2027).  Loan officers, together with the \nbranch manager at \u2018Wesu\u2019, considered they were under great pressure to retrieve the \nmoney borrowed and reduce the portfolio at risk. They therefore prioritised \n\u2018delinquency\u2019 at the expense of other activities as institutional survival came first. \nSharma and Zeller (1997) reported the same concerns by field workers in Bangladesh. \nConsequently, money issues dominated discussions in the daily morning meetings.  \nOne loan officer put it this way:  \nClients shun meetings because they don\u2019t want you to talk about them. They tend to lose interest \nif all you talk about is money and defaulters. To them, it\u2019s a sheer waste of time to sit in these \nmeetings. But again if the default thing is still there, we will be forced to talk about it \n \nThe outcome of such a pre-occupation with chasing up defaulters as seen at \u2018Wesu\u2019 \nbranch (probably a reflection of the whole organisation) is twofold: The first is, the \n\u2018gasp for cash\u2019 \u2013 a concern for immediate survival where defaulters are pursued by \nwhatever it takes. The second is the \u2018suffocation\u2019 of growth. There was no new growth \nas loan officers did not facilitate the formation of new groups and thereby failed to \nadvance the outreach frontiers. Loan officers complained that, \u2018management did not \ntake into account the fact that the \u2018delinquency\u2019 exercise was time consuming, stressful \nand frustrating\u2019.  As we shall see below, however, the immediate survival strategy is \nproblematic and potentially self-defeating. This is well illustrated by members from the \nsolidarity group and trust bank (see box 2) \n \nBox 2 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI think that these loan officers have too many trust banks and solidarity groups that are not doing well \nand so they are spending their time debt collecting you see! So those of us doing well are suffering. \nWe are neglected and concentration is on those in arrears and defaulting. For instance our loan officer \nis now just concentrating on groups that are giving him problems. He has just become a debt collector \nand sometimes he doesn\u2019t even come to our meetings-just busy chasing those owing. Do we have to \nbe pushing them? (Trust bank member-2). \n \nI have seen a problem with CETZAM-this is that, initially when we started learning about their \nmethodology they would tell us, ha! that the time of waiting for the next loan would be short once the \nprevious one is paid for. They told us two weeks. But look at them now! They take their time and \nkeep on promising until may be a month goes- even f r those paying well. So where is the incentive \nin paying back on time? Now is this good? Admittedly, there are times when we clients cause these \ns:\\staff\\dro - durham research online\\fulltext\\departments\\business school\\4288\\journal article-acforum.doc 21\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe first client accused loan officers of concentrating on poor performing groups and \nneglecting the \u2018good\u2019 ones (i.e. management by exception), as their needs are not \nattended to in time. The second client claimed loan officers were delaying the \ndisbursement of loans unnecessarily while both clients express feelings of frustration \nand disappointment with the resulting shift of emphasis. Musona (2004) found Zambian \nMFIs slow in loan processing and disbursement, which in turn increased client exit. \nDelays in loan disbursement here damaged the reputation of CETZAM (by word of \nmouth) and are harming both sustainability and growth. Consequently, outreach for the \nbranch declined, but costs per member increased due to the resource intensive exercise \nof chasing up defaulters.  \n The survivalist approach taken had therefore displaced other key activities such as the \nselling of CETZAM\u2019s products to potential borrowers and the formation of new groups. \nOne loan officer (visibly annoyed) said: \n As loan officers we have no time to sell CETZAM products, form new groups and give proper \norientation. It seems marketing is secondary and collecting money for now is priority.  \nLoan officers also revealed that, on average, each loan officer had only managed to \nform two new groups in that year. \u2018There is just too much time spent chasing up \ndefaulters\u2019 they said, an exercise proving costly to the organisation, as well as \nimmediately frustrating to loan officers.    \n \n\u2018Delinquency\u2019 Management Strategies \nLoan officers first threatened to use the group\u2019s loan security fund (LSF) to clear \narrears.  In several group meetings attended, loan officers used the LSF to force \nmembers into putting pressure on those defaulting and to create a sense of urgency in \nthose who had finished paying and were not ready to forfeit their LSF. However, this \npractice of seizing clients\u2019 LSF may have been effective in the short-term, but could \ns:\\staff\\dro - durham research online\\fulltext\\departments\\business school\\4288\\journal article-acforum.doc 22\nwell undermine members\u2019 long-term participation. Members whose repayment records \nwere good did not appreciate losing the LSF and therefore leave. One client indeed \nsaid:  \n\u2018Why is the branch talking so much about arrears when our LSF is used to offset loan amounts not \npaid by the group\u2019?  \nMKNelly and Kevane (2003) report similar negative sentiments among group clients in \nBurkina Faso, where the practice destabilized groups and consequently re-loans were \ndelayed. Another strategy was to use external pressure- police officers- to get defaulters \nto pay or confiscate household items for sale to recover the money. While in \nBangladesh (Grameen Bank, BRAC etc), field workers would not use police help to \nrecover loans, but asked influential local people to exert pressure (Ahmad, 2002; Jain \nand Moore, 2003), at CETZAM  the loan officer did use the police instead: \nI have had two situations where I have used the police and in one case I had to take one person to \nthe police and she was locked up and later paid something but relations were destroyed. I feel very \nbad about it. It\u2019s just that my job demands that I bring back the money. It is not right because in \nmost cases items grabbed may not necessarily have come from CETZAM\u2019s loan (L\/O 2). \nSuch \u2018harassment\u2019 however, serves both an immediate purpose of trying to recover the \nmoney and the more important, broader purpose of signalling publicly that the \nconsequences of becoming a defaulter can be made to be embarrassing, especially in a \nsociety where credit and debt are intensely private issues (Aryeetey, 1996 quoted in \nBastelaer, 1999: 13; Christensen, 1993).  When asked why the police were being used, \na visibly disturbed L\/O said: \nIf I don\u2019t do this, what will the office think of me? They will not believe my story- at least if I tell \nthem that the police went with me to clients\u2019 businesses, they will then take me seriously and \nbelieve that I am working. Those people [at the office] don\u2019t listen. And at times, clients have to \nsee one of their friends dragged to the police for them to get serious with payments (L\/O 4). \nFrom the loan officer\u2019s perspective, this use of police met two purposes: authenticating \ntheir \u2018audit\u2019 reports to the manager, and shaming defaulters into paying. Presumably, \nsuch social shame creates difficulties for many, as defaulters become stigmatized, \nsending negative signals to non-members about CETZAM. Other studies have reported \ndefaulters losing household items (see Ito, 2003; MKNelly and Kevane, 2003; Rahman, \n1999b). Clients revealed that this can be equally embarrassing, especially if it leads to \ndomestic tensions and violence, weakening marriage ties. This was illustrated in a focus \ngroup discussion of five women and three men. \ns:\\staff\\dro - durham research online\\fulltext\\departments\\business school\\4288\\journal article-acforum.doc 23\nIt\u2019s important that women inform husbands because there are times when CETZAM grabs items \nfrom defaulters and so if [I] the husband has bought [my] TV, Fridge etc and discover that these \nhave been taken for sale to recover money owed, my wife would be in big trouble [with a \nfrowning face]. This creates a lot of tensions in homes (man client).  \nThose who do it in secret usually get in trouble and some even get divorces (elderly woman client \n2).  \nHowever, the CETZAM chief executive officer believed that seizing assets from clients \nand using the police did not fit with the social agenda and therefore did not openly \nsupport such action, but acknowledged it as a sensitive issue. \n A third option was that of policing \u2018time\u2019 by paying frequent visits and \u2018pouncing\u2019 on \ndefaulters at dawn and dusk. Loan officers appeared compliant, citing that they had jobs \nto protect.  Such visits at awkward hours were themselves shameful, visibly exposing \ndefaulters to their community and also denied loan officers\u2019 control of their \u2018private\u2019 \ntime. Loan officers voiced concern over their personal safety in these \u2018raids,\u2019 that they \nfelt very vulnerable to attacks by angry and violent clients. The gravity of the matter \nwas shared by one of the senior managers at head office who cited an incident where a \ndog attacked a loan officer as he visited a defaulter\u2019s home.  \nIn view of these strategies, CETZAM had increasing problems with stressful and \nfrustrated loan officers. This was well captured by two loan officers in separate \nincidents, the first after a hectic day out together, claiming that:  \nA loan officer you see is supposed to be on the side of management as well as on the side of \nclients. So you have no time for own personal things because of too much pressure, no time to \nrelax and sometimes all you dream about is delinquency. I actually dread reporting for work, as I \nhave to figure out what I will have to say to convince the manager.  \nThe second, through an email two months later, wrote:  \nI have just had a lousy day at work, and thank God for your mail, it brought me back to the real \nworld. My loan officer job is as usual, and we continue to write the daily reports-it is such hell! I \nthink we just might end up resigning (communication received 26 February 2004). \n          These two quotations reveal signs of emotional stress and effort on the part of \nmanagement to make loan officers explicitly justify what they have done, make their \njob more transparent, and thus controllable from above, in a manner of managerial \nsurveillance (Hillhorst, 2003). A particular branch manager asserted that microfinance \nwas a \u2018sensitive business\u2019 and \u2018the moment loan officers are frustrated you have a \nproblem\u2019. Ahmad (2002) makes reference to similar signs of stress in Bangladesh with \nPROSHIKA, where a field worker reported having no leisure but a life made tense \nwhenever he had to abuse his clients to recover money and thus save his job. This \ns:\\staff\\dro - durham research online\\fulltext\\departments\\business school\\4288\\journal article-acforum.doc 24\nheightens tensions between both loan officers and clients, and management and loan \nofficers, and also exacerbates repayment problems as well as \u2018suffocating\u2019 new growth. \n \nIt is clear that CETZAM cannot survive on the \u2018core\u2019 business of pursuing defaulters on \nthe scale observed here where it also relied upon good client-loan officer relationships \n(Schreiner, 1999) and few defaults. Loan officers were acting more as debt collectors \nthan enablers, and therefore experienced burnout and stress through increasing self-\nsacrifice. This expectation may lead them to withdraw and, as one manager said, \u2018When \na loan officer resigns, it\u2019s difficult to replace them\u2019 because, according to Schreiner \n(1999), \u2018they are not interchangeable parts\u2019.  \nIn addition, the use of police, confiscation of assets and possible morning and evening \n\u2018raids\u2019 were creating tensions between the task-oriented role and the \u2018nurturing\u2019 role \nthat loan officers were expected to perform. For example, the MFI formally expected \n\u2018professionalism\u2019 since they have to fulfil their organisation\u2019s expectations, while \nclients on the other hand, expect to see more of the social skills of the loan officer- \nworking \u2018from the heart and not the mind\u2019. Loan officers therefore engaged in what \nHochschild (1983) calls \u2018emotional labour\u2019 to achieve the financial goals and were \nsubject to \u2018emotion management\u2019 (Fineman, 2000; Taylor, 1998). This emotion \nmanagement was demanding. For instance, loan officers acted as if they were interested \nin clients\u2019 lives, their children, their personal problems such as sickness, family funerals \netc. They \u2018put on a sympathetic faces\u2019 in matters that were otherwise purely financial. \nClients on the other hand respond to loan officers who show that they care and feel for \nthem. Anything else on the part of loan officers could reduce goodwill and make further \nclient mobilisation difficult. In addition, when emotion management fails, it is possible \nthat a trust bank will dissolve and loan repayment will fail. These performed emotions \nand tensions shape the course and outcomes of strategies used in recovering debt but \nare sometimes overlooked. Demanding as they might be, loan officers were quick to \nmention that such displays were rewarding to the extent that they produced increased \nloan repayment, (out of social rather than contractual obligation).  \n \nCONCLUSION \nAlthough CETZAM is neither anywhere near the scale and size nor stage of \ndevelopment of the Bangladesh MFIs, it is nevertheless arguably increasingly \nrepresentative of emerging MFIs \u2013especially in Africa going through early \ns:\\staff\\dro - durham research online\\fulltext\\departments\\business school\\4288\\journal article-acforum.doc 25\ndevelopmental problems. The case shows that, while the original Bangladesh model has \nbeen officially confirmed and\/or academically studied and evaluated, albeit in strikingly \neconomic terms, it is still possible to question the answers it would provide.  Moreover, \nBangladesh is no longer at the same early founding stage as other frontier territory like \nZambia, which has its own 'greenfield' issues to resolve while Bangladesh moves on.  \nThe successes claimed for the latter nevertheless constitute important hopes and values \nfor founding and developing microfinance at these other frontiers which few wish to \nquell with accounts about failings and failures as well.  Emerging 'second \ngeneration' microfinance institutions may draw upon this other knowledge yet still \nencounter different problems in the field which they were not thereby led to expect or \nnecessarily plan ahead for. To extend financial services to 100 million of the poor by \nthe end of 2005 (Wydick, 2002),  MFIs need further insights into the \u2018real\u2019 world of a \nloan officer faced with divergent expectations and powerful hierarchical levels of \naccountability if they are to advance their lending work and meet the set targets. The \ncase shows that outside Bangladesh, there is more to be learnt about how microfinance \nhas been translated elsewhere, what loan officers do, and how they are managed. An \nadditional insight is that clients and loan officers bring very different expectations to \ntheir encounters, which clearly impact upon whatever results.  \nThe findings also raise concerns over the nature of accountability that is becoming \nrequired of loan officers by management in the context of \u2018overblown\u2019 non-repayment \nof loans and the extent to which management can demand accountability without \ninhibiting loan officers\u2019 work and microfinance development. This is not to obscure the \nneed to solve \u2018loan delinquency\u2019 problems with all the resources at its disposal but it \ndoes call for more consistency with the hopes and values of microfinance proper. Any \nsuch solution ultimately needed to be better aligned to, and also drawn from, those \nhopes and values for it to remain \u2018double tasked\u2019, knowing that anything less risked \nconverting its mission and organisation into something else.  \nThe case also provides evidence to support Schreiner\u2019s (1999) view that microfinance \ndepends on personal relationships and that loan officers play a key role in building and \nmaintaining the social bonds which serve as a resource for both clients and loan \nofficers. However, what seems prominent in this study is the difficulties loan officers \nhave in pursuing defaulters and the means used. In such a crisis, loan officer\u2019s success \nor failure may depend on how best the loan officer plays and manages emotions and \nrelationships with clients. Consistent with Ahmad (2002) and Goetz (2001), the \ns:\\staff\\dro - durham research online\\fulltext\\departments\\business school\\4288\\journal article-acforum.doc 26\nfindings of the study show that making the problems of late loan repayment more \nvisibly public can be embarrassing or shameful for the client with lasting negative \neffects for the MFI. The findings also some support Gjerding\u2019s (2002) view that, \nmicrocredit lending process is not straightforward as complicated social and cultural \npatterns of behaviour, strategies and power structures have a big say when it comes to \ndiscovering what the outcome of a specific micro credit programme will be. This case, \nalbeit related to one specific case study, indicates that giving careful attention to loan \nofficers \u2013the implementers of lending policies and mobilizers of clients can enhance \nour understanding of microfinance development. While the level of development and \nrules of governance of the microfinance industry, interest rates, organisational costs and \nlending policies are all important contributors to institution\u2019s performance, the success \nor failure of microfinance depends largely on loan officers. If loan officers fail, \nmicrofinance (especially group based) fails with them.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nReferences \n \nAhmad, M. M. (2002) \u2018Who cares?
