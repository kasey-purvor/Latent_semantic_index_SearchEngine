Two modelling programs were \nused: BasinMod and HotPot. BasinMod models are based on thermal maturity at borehole sites; \nHotPot models operate on stacks of 2D layer grids using a mechanical compaction method. The \nthermal and burial history modelling indicates up to 1.9 km of additional burial of Carboniferous \nstrata compared to present day levels: up to 660 m deposited by the end of the Carboniferous \nperiod subsequently removed by Variscan uplift and erosion, followed by up to 1.9 km of burial \n24\/3\/09  2\/38 \nby sedimentary rocks deposited during the Permian to the Palaeogene periods. Temperatures \ngreater than 130 \u00baC were reached by the most deeply buried Carboniferous sedimentary rocks. \nMississippian (Lower Carboniferous) rocks reached the oil generation window during the mid \nCarboniferous, with Pennsylvanian (Upper Carboniferous) rocks reaching the oil generation \nwindow during the Cretaceous. Sedimentation rates were of 0.03-0.63 m ka-1 (metres per \nthousand years) with changes in the rate and the position of depocentres consistent with both \nextensional and strike-slip basin formation.  \n \n \n \nThe Midland Valley of Scotland (MVS) Terrane has had a prolonged and complex geological \nhistory, initiated in the Palaeozoic era as a Caledonide compressional feature but followed by \nSiluro-Devonian and Carboniferous phases of extensional and strike-slip basin formation (e.g. \nSmith 1995; Rippon et al. 1996). The post-Palaeozoic history is difficult to define due to erosion \nand overprinting by younger tectonic events. Carboniferous sedimentary basins exhibit fault-\nbounded and synclinal\/anticlinal structural styles typical of extensional to strike-slip settings \n(Read et al. 2002; Rippon et al. 1996; Ritchie et al. 2003; Underhill et al., 2008). One such \nCarboniferous basin, the Midlothian-Leven syncline (Figure 1), in the eastern Midland Valley of \nScotland, has been extensively studied due to a high quality seismic dataset and coastal \nexposures. Its tectonic and stratigraphical development is well documented (Ritchie et al. 2003; \nUnderhill et al., 2008) and a schematic model has been proposed for the generation of \nhydrocarbons which occur around its margins (Underhill et al., 2008). However, detailed \nnumerical data on the burial and thermal history of the basin are lacking. This paper integrates \nmaturity data from three boreholes, compaction data from a further eight boreholes (Table 1) and \ngridded 2D surfaces of key stratigraphical horizons to investigate the depth, timing and \n24\/3\/09  3\/38 \ntemperature of burial of Lower to Upper Carboniferous strata and their subsequent post-\nPalaeozoic history. Much of the thermal maturity data is from Raymond (1991). \nThe models are constructed using two contrasting modelling packages; Basinmod and Hotpot. \nBasinMod (Platte River Associates Inc. software) models compaction and temperature through \nburial over geological time using stratigraphical and vitrinite reflectance maturity data from a \nborehole. The first step in HotPot (British Geological Survey (BGS) software) is to undertake a \ndepth of burial study using rock density properties of mudstone to map the predicted thickness of \neroded overburden within the study area. A calculation is then applied to restore the depositional \nthickness (backstripping) of stratigraphical units and construct the basin depositional history \nmodel. This is in turn used to compute the thermal history model. HotPot provides a basin-wide \noverview using grids from structural interpretation, giving a \u2018broad-brush\u2019 basin history. \nBasinMod provides analysis on 1D boreholes and allows detailed variability in sedimentation \nrates etc., to be considered. The modelling techniques used by HotPot and BasinMod \ncomplement each other and were used iteratively to achieve the final model.  \nGeological setting \nThe MVS is bounded by the Caledonide Highland Boundary Fault to the north and the Southern \nUpland Fault to the south, with an internally complex arrangement of Carboniferous sedimentary \nbasins and Carboniferous volcanic rocks overlying Lower Palaeozoic strata (e.g. Read et al. \n2002). The MVS forms part of a system of Late Devonian to Carboniferous sedimentary basins \nthat developed across northern Britain in the foreland of the complex accretion of microplates \nthat made up the Variscan Orogen (e.g. Ziegler 1990). Several different regional tectonic models \nhave been proposed to explain basin formation: back-arc extension in relation to northwards \nsubduction of the Rheic Ocean lithosphere (Leeder 1982); dextral megashear during accretion of \nGondwana and Laurentia that stretched from North America to Russia (Arthaud and Matte 1977; \nDewey 1982); or dextral escape tectonics of a continental block during the early Carboniferous \nwith sinistral strike-slip movement over the area of the MVS Terrane followed by late \n24\/3\/09  4\/38 \nCarboniferous reversal of the escaping continental block resulting in dextral strike-slip across \nnorthern Britain (Coward 1993). \nRitchie et al. (2003) and Underhill et al. (2008) interpreted seismic and onshore data from the \nMidlothian-Leven syncline and agree that dextral strike-slip determined the formation of NNE-\nSSW synclinal basins in the late Carboniferous, followed by end Carboniferous inversion, uplift \nand magmatism. Interpretations of the early-mid Carboniferous basin development differ. \nRitchie et al. (2003) favour extensional NNE-trending half-graben developed under sinistral \nstrike-slip and inverted in the late Carboniferous period following basin-wide subsidence, \nwhereas Underhill et al. (2008) propose syncline formation under dextral strike-slip from the \nmid to late Vis\u00e9an stage. This study is partially based upon the 2D stratigraphical layer surfaces \nfrom the Ritchie et al. (2003) tectonic and stratigraphical model which fits with the regional \ntectonic model of Coward (1993).  \nIn this model, active extension in half-graben basins, rapid subsidence and volcanism occurred \nduring Late Devonian to end Mississippian times (Ochil Volcanic to mid Passage Formations; \nRitchie et al. 2003). Extension-related magmatism associated with lithospheric thinning and a \npresumed high heat flow was widespread across the MVS (Smedley 1986; Upton et al. 2004). \nDuring the early Pennsylvanian period (mid Namurian), active extension appeared to give way to \npost-extensional thermal subsidence with local structural inversion and growth folding (Ritchie \net al. 2003). Less voluminous extensional, intraplate magmatism continued until Westphalian \ntimes (Upton et al. 2004). Mid Pennsylvanian (Westphalian) dextral strike-slip followed the \nlocal structural inversion and growth folding (Ritchie et al. 2003). Towards the late \nCarboniferous climax of the Variscan Orogeny, tightening of the NNE-trending folds and \ncreation of other N- and NW-trending folds occurred resulting in a Westphalian D to Stephanian \nage unconformity (Corfield et al. 1996; Rippon et al. 1996).  \nStephanian to Early Permian post-orogenic extension occurred in response to the gravitational \ncollapse of the Variscan Orogen and far-field dextral extensional stress between Gondwana and \n24\/3\/09  5\/38 \nLaurentian plates (Ziegler 1990; Timmerman 2004). Latest Carboniferous tholeiitic magmatism \n(Midland Valley Sill complex), including ENE- to ESE-trending tholeiitic dykes and extensional \nfaults, cut across tightened and inverted Carboniferous basins (Rippon et al. 1996; Stephenson et \nal. 2003). Permian volcanic and sedimentary rocks were subsequently deposited (e.g. Mauchline \nBasin, Mykura et al. 1967). \nCarboniferous stratigraphy  \nThe interbedded Carboniferous sedimentary and volcanic rocks of the MVS form a succession \nup to 5 km thick. The sedimentary rocks were deposited in fluvial, lacustrine and deltaic \nenvironments with periodic marine incursions (Browne et al. 1999; Figure 2). Boreholes used in \nthis study penetrate coal measures and Clackmannan Group strata and some sample as deep as \nthe  mid Mississippian Strathclyde Group. The latter is divided into vertically and laterally \nvariable formations and is dominantly fluvio-deltaic (Browne et al. 1999; Figure 2). Owens et al. \n(2005) present an alternative stratigraphical evaluation of Mississippian strata from East Fife \nbased on recent palynological zonations. However, the work presented here is not dependent on \nwhich stratigraphical scheme is used. The Upper Mississippian and Pennsylvanian sedimentary \nrocks of the Lower Limestone to Scottish Middle Coal Measures formations, which form the \nmain units examined in this study, are commonly regionally correlated, cyclical marine to non-\nmarine deposits with several economically important coal-bearing formations (Browne et al. \n1999; Figure 2). A mid-Carboniferous hiatus that affected much of Europe and North America is \nconsidered by Read et al. (2002) to occur within the Passage Formation although marine strata \nwere deposited without an erosional surface within the formation during this period so it is \ndifficult to identify the boundary between the Mississippian and Pennsylvanian sub-systems.    \nPost Carboniferous geological history \nScotland has been subjected to regional uplift since the early Paleocene (Hillis et al. 1994) due to \nmagmatic underplating from a mantle plume during the opening of the North Atlantic (White \n1988). In the MVS, the compaction state of the exposed Carboniferous rocks and the presence of \n24\/3\/09  6\/38 \nlate Palaeozoic and Mesozoic successions in parts of Scotland and its offshore waters has led to \nthe hypothesis that the younger successions encroached on the MVS (e.g. Cameron and \nStephenson 1985) and have since been removed by uplift and erosion.  \nThere are no proven Permian and Triassic rocks in the Midlothian-Leven synclinal basins but \nrocks of this age are preserved locally onshore in the Mauchline Basin, Ayrshire (Mykura et al. \n1967), on Arran (BGS 1987) and in the Larne Borehole, Northern Ireland (Penn et al. 1983). \nSequences of Permian and Jurassic rocks up to c. 1.5 km thick are preserved offshore in the outer \nFirth of Forth\/Forth Approaches and in the Firth of Clyde (BGS 1985; Cartwright et al. 2001). \nNorth of the MVS, Jurassic to early Cretaceous sedimentary rocks crop out in the Inner Moray \nFirth (Hillis et al. 1994). Gatliff et al. (1994) describe the Jurassic to Cretaceous rocks found in \nthe central North Sea, adjacent to the Midland Valley Terrane. Jurassic and Cretaceous rocks are \nalso found in vent masses in Arran (BGS 1987), supporting the view of published \npalaeogeographies (e.g. Coward et al. 2003) that warm seas covered the MVS during the Late \nCretaceous period. In summary, late Palaeozoic and Mesozoic deposition may have been \nsubstantial across the MVS. Sedimentary deposition is likely to have ended at around 60 Ma, \nduring the early Palaeogene, coeval with the start of North Atlantic magmatism, uplift and \nerosion.  \nSummary of the BasinMod model \nBasinMod (Platte River software) is designed to model the basin geo-history and thermal \nmaturity through time. Calculations are based on individual modelled stratigraphic units to allow \naccurate decompaction and backstripping. Thickness of units in boreholes, average lithologies \nand other rock parameters are entered for each stratigraphical unit and an appropriate method for \ndecompaction is selected by the user. Palaeo-thermal history is reconstructed from measured data \nsuch as vitrinite reflectance.  \n24\/3\/09  7\/38 \nSelection of boreholes \nData were entered into the BasinMod (version 7 and 3.1, Platte River Associates Inc.). Boreholes \nwere selected on the following criteria: length of bore, suitable stratigraphical detail and \navailability of vitrinite reflectance (VR) data. A large number of boreholes were considered for \nmodelling, but vitrinite reflectance data were rarely available in sufficient quantity to reliably \ncalibrate the model, thus the number of suitable boreholes was limited. The three chosen \nboreholes were Firth of Forth Tower 1 and Milton of Balgonie boreholes on the western limb of \nthe Leven Syncline and Eskmouth Borehole close to the Midlothian syncline axis (Figure 1). VR \ndata for the Eskmouth and Milton of Balgonie boreholes were taken from Raymond (1991). \nMaturity modelling using BasinMod \nBorehole stratigraphy and rock properties were used to model compaction and temperature \nthrough burial over geological time in the three boreholes. Eroded overburden was modelled \nbased on surrounding boreholes and literary sources such as Cameron and Stephenson (1985). \nThe modelled maturity and measured maturity data were then compared graphically and used to \niteratively develop the model until a good fit to the VR data was achieved (see below for \ndescription of influence that heat flow and overburden have on the modelled VR curve). The \nslope of the modelled maturity (VR) plot is influenced by the palaeo-heat flow, the maturity at \nany particular time is more strongly influenced by the thickness of overlying sediments. \nBasinMod 1D calculates heat flow curves based on the finite rifting model of Jarvis and \nMcKenzie (1980). This assumes that in an extensional environment there is rapid initial \nsubsidence due to crustal thinning associated with a thermal anomaly, i.e. high heat flow. This \nmodel recognises that continental basin formation by extension takes a finite time. When crustal \nstretching ceases, heat is lost by vertical conduction and the slow decay of the heat flow leads to \nfurther subsidence due to thermal contraction. For modelling heat flow in basins with limited \nextension (stretching factor \u03b2, which measures the thickness of the crust at a given time relative \n24\/3\/09  8\/38 \nto its initial thickness, where a value greater than 1 indicates the crust has been extended and \nthinned), the Jarvis and McKenzie (1980) model plots thermal anomaly development and decay \nbased on typical heat conduction properties of lithologies. The heat flow curves for this paper \nwere based on the Jarvis and McKenzie model with minor modifications (e.g. slowing decay of \nheat flow in the late Carboniferous to influence the steepness of model VR curve) to better fit the \ndata, and also to accommodate the geological history of underplating of the region. The palaeo-\nheatflow curve used for modelling was based on the assumption that extension would have been \nassociated with high heat flow from the start to the end of the Mississippian (early Namurian) \nsub-period. High heat flow was expected to continue with active faulting and folding into the \nearly Pennsylvanian (mid-Namurian) sub-period as extension continued. During mid-Namurian \ntimes, active rifting is inferred to have given way to post-extensional thermal subsidence. The \nheat flow would be expected to slowly decline after active rifting and volcanism had ceased. As \nthe youngest strata in the boreholes is of Carboniferous age, more detailed modelling of the heat \nflow using BasinMod after this time was not attempted and thus it was assumed that the heat \nflow declined slowly to the present day level based on the Jarvis and McKenzie (1980) model. \nThe current heat flow in Edinburgh is around 53 mW m-2 (milli Watts per square metre) (Rollin \net al. 2002). Average surface temperatures were added for completeness to the BasinMod and \nHotPot models. It was assumed surface temperatures were generally higher during the \nCarboniferous period when this region was near the equator, and then slowly declined to the \npresent day average of around 9 \u00b0C (Meteorological Office 2004). For simplicity of the model, it \nwas assumed that any additional Carboniferous strata deposited before the Variscan that is not \nseen in the present day stratigraphy was removed by the uplift and erosion associated with the \nVariscan tectonic event and Permian sediments were deposited unconformably on this erosional \nsurface. A second period of non-deposition\/erosion, beginning around 60Ma during the early \nPalaeogene, at the start of North Atlantic magmatism, uplift and erosion, was also included in the \nBasinMod models.  \n24\/3\/09  9\/38 \nFor modelling purposes, lithology mixes were constructed based on the selected boreholes. \nEroded overlying lithologies of Carboniferous to Present age were approximated using borehole \nrecords held by BGS Keyworth National Geoscience Records Centre and Murchison House, \nEdinburgh and available literature cited elsewhere in this paper. Overlying depth of water was \nnot included in the BasinMod models because it has a relatively minor influence on the model \ncalculations for the deeply buried Carboniferous formations.  \nPlots of the modelled maturity and temperature vs. depth and time from the boreholes modelled \nwith BasinMod were produced (Figures 3 to 5). These model results were then compared with \nthe HotPot results at those sites and used to iteratively improve both the BasinMod and HotPot \nmodels. \nEskmouth Borehole  \nEskmouth Borehole 50\/56 (Reference NT37SW\/31, British National Grid reference [334530 \n673320]) lies on the axis of the Leven Syncline south of the HotPot modelling area. The \nborehole has a good distribution of vitrinite reflectance data (Raymond 1991). The borehole \nstratigraphy was entered into the BasinMod model divided on the basis of formation, then further \nsubdivided based on rock characteristics to refine the model. The BasinMod burial history and \nmodel isotherms (10 \u00baC spacing) are shown in Figure 3. Not all stratigraphical layers used in the \nmodel are shown on the diagram for clarity. The horizontal line across the top of the model \nindicates the present day 'surface\u2019 and model layers intersected by this line have been eroded \nbefore the present day. Comparison of the vitrinite reflectance data with the modelled maturity \nand the modelled heat flow are illustrated in Figures 3b and 3c. Some scatter of the vitrinite \nreflectance (VR) data may be a result of \u2018suppression\u2019 due to the presence of algal matter (Carr \n2000). The Eskmouth Borehole can be successfully modelled using a maximum heat flow of \naround 67 mW m-2 during mid-Carboniferous times and deposition of an additional 450 m \n(uncompacted thickness) of strata during the late Pennsylvanian period. It was assumed these \nadditional strata were eroded during Variscan tectonic activity (at the end of Pennsylvanian \n24\/3\/09  10\/38 \nperiod, around 300 My before present day). A further 1800 m of sediment deposition was added \nto the model for Permian to Paleocene strata. The eroded thicknesses were modelled based on \nthe best fit of the modelled maturity to the VR data. This model predicts a maximum depth of \nburial of 2900 m for the top of the Lower Limestone Formation during the Cainozoic period \nwhen the maximum temperature of 115 \u00baC was reached. The model results for the Eskmouth \nBorehole in Figure 3b imply the Lower Limestone and Limestone Coal formations reached the \noil generation window during the mid to late Carboniferous, and that the younger strata up to the \nmid Upper Coal Measures Formation reached the oil window during maximum burial in the \nPalaeogene period.  \nThe Eskmouth Borehole stratigraphy was used to calculate approximate sedimentation rates for \nmajor formations. The Passage Formation has a relatively low sedimentation rate of around \n0.03 m ka-1 (metres per thousand years) based on the borehole stratigraphy. The Upper \nLimestone Formation has a sedimentation rate of approximately 0.13 m ka-1 and the Limestone \nCoal Formation a rate of approximately 0.19 m ka-1. The Scottish Lower Coal Measures \nFormation have a sedimentation rate of approximately 0.10 m ka-1.  \nTower 1 Borehole  \nFirth of Forth Tower 1 Borehole (Reference NT38NW\/1, British National Grid Reference \n[330024 687894]) lies on the west limb of the Leven Syncline (Figure 1). There is not as \nabundant nor such a good coverage of VR data in comparison to Eskmouth Borehole, so the heat \nflow used for this model was largely based on the heat flow used for Eskmouth (Raymond 1991). \nA thin sill intrudes through this borehole, but does not appear to have affected the available \nvitrinite reflectance data (Figure 4a). The data from Tower 1 Borehole can be successfully \nmodelled using a maximum heat flow of around 82 mW m-2 in the Carboniferous and deposition \nof an additional 420 m of sediment at the end of the Carboniferous (which was then assumed to \nhave been removed by erosion by Variscan tectonic events) and 1900 m sediment deposition \nthrough the Permian to Palaeogene (Figure 4a). This model predicts a maximum depth of burial \n24\/3\/09  11\/38 \nof 2900 m for the Limestone Coal Formation during the Cainozoic period when the maximum \ntemperature of around 110 \u00baC was reached. Figure 4a suggests that the Limestone Coal \nFormation in Tower 1 Borehole entered the oil window at shallower depth than in the Eskmouth \nBorehole during the Carboniferous Period and the younger strata up to the Lower Coal Measures \nreached the oil generation window during deep burial in the Early Palaeogene. Strata thickness \nchanges for the Palaeogene are based on geological interpretation as the BasinMod models are \nless constrained due to the lack of VR data. This is consistent with the borehole location being \non the basin margin. The heat flow (Figure 4c) was modelled as being similar to Eskmouth \nBorehole. \nThe sedimentation rates were again calculated from the borehole stratigraphy using BasinMod. \nThe Passage Formation again appears to have a relatively low sedimentation rate of 0.07 m ka-1. \nThe Upper Limestone Formation has a sedimentation rate of approximately 0.15 m ka-1 and the \nLimestone Coal Formation a rate of approximately 0.16 m ka-1 (though this sedimentation rate \nestimation may have been affected by intrusion of an 18-m thick sill in this layer).   \nMilton of Balgonie Borehole  \nMilton of Balgonie Borehole is located in the north of the study region near an anticlinal high on \nthe margins of the Leven Syncline (Figure 1) (Reference NT39NW\/385, British National Grid \nReference [331733 699335]). This borehole cuts through the Midland Valley Sill complex \n(Figure 5a), which caused localised heating of the strata in the Lower Limestone Formation \n(Raymond 1991). Figure 5b clearly shows the effects of igneous intrusion; the vitrinite \nreflectance data show a sharp peak around the sill indicating localised heating. The few points of \nvitrinite reflectance data in the Strathclyde Group that are considerably higher than the clustered \ntrend are also located near minor intrusions.  \nThe data from Milton of Balgonie Borehole can be successfully modelled using a maximum heat \nflow of around 68 mW m-2 (Figure 5c) during the Carboniferous period. Deposition of an \nadditional 660 m of sediment (which was then assumed to have been removed by erosion during \n24\/3\/09  12\/38 \nthe Variscan Orogeny) at the end of the Carboniferous period was modelled and a further \n1300 m sediment deposited through the Permian to Palaeogene periods. This model predicts a \nmaximum depth of burial of 2300 m for the Limestone Coal Formation when the maximum \ntemperature of around 95 \u00baC was reached. The high VR values resulting from the igneous \nintrusions were not considered in the model VR curve since the interest here was in the \ncompaction and burial of the sedimentary rocks in this region. However, the intrusion of the \nMidland Valley Sill and other intrusions may have affected the sedimentation rate estimations. \nBasinMod results indicate that the Strathclyde Group strata reached the oil generation window \nduring the Late Mississippian to Pennsylvanian and the younger strata up to the Limestone Coal \nFormation entered the oil window during Cainozoic burial. \nThe sedimentation rates were calculated in BasinMod using Milton of Balgonie Borehole \nstratigraphy. The Passage Formation again appears to have a relatively low sedimentation rate of \n0.05 m ka-1. The Upper Limestone Formation has a sedimentation rate of 0.14 m ka-1, the \nLimestone Coal Formation a rate of 0.19 m ka-1 and the Lower Limestone Formation a rate of \n0.22 m ka-1 (though this value may have been affected by intrusion of the Midland Valley Sill). \nThe Strathclyde Group underneath this reaches a thickness of 805.7 m and the Pittenweem beds \nare identified at 1798 m BRT (below rotary table). Using the age of this bed from the borehole \nlog and the thickness of sediment, BasinMod gives a sedimentation rate of approximately 0.13 m \nka-1.  \nSummary of the HotPot model \nThe BGS modelling program HotPot (Rowley et al. 1993) produces pseudo-3D depositional and \nthermal history models of sedimentary basins using a surface-based approach. This is the \ncounterpoint to standard commercial oil-industry basin modelling software, such as BasinMod, \nwhich use vertical modelling methods, either at well-bores (1D) or along cross-sections (2D). In \nHotPot modelling, the basin fill is first backstripped, that is starting with the most recent layer \nand successively stripping away one layer at a time, restoring by decompaction the thicknesses \n24\/3\/09  13\/38 \nof the underlying strata. Then a vertical heat transfer calculation is applied at each stage of the \nreconstructed depositional history, to synthesise the thermal history of the basin fill. Where the \ntopmost preserved layer is not a recent deposit, it is necessary to estimate the thickness of eroded \noverburden and introduce it as a layer to be restored during modelling. \nDepth of burial study \nThe youngest strata preserved in the study area are of late Carboniferous Bolsovian (Westphalian \nC) age (BGS 1999). As discussed previously, the original succession probably included Permian \nand younger strata which have been eroded, thus a depth of burial study was carried out to \nestimate the thickness of these eroded strata.  \nAs sedimentary deposits are progressively buried, their porosity decreases and their density \nincreases. This relationship has been demonstrated by laboratory and theoretical work (Sclater \nand Christie 1980; Baldwin and Butler 1985) and observed in borehole logs (e.g. Lang 1980). \nCompaction also depends on sediment type; for example, mudstones compact more readily and \nto a greater degree than sandstones. The compaction process is irreversible; sediments do not \n\u2018decompact\u2019 if their burial depth is reduced by uplift and erosion. Once a set of compaction \ncurves (density vs. depth vs. lithology, Figure 6) have been established from a fully preserved \nsequence, the maximum depth to which a sample, of known lithology and density, was buried is \ndetermined by finding the density on the appropriate curve and reading the corresponding depth. \nAn estimate of the thickness of overburden eroded from the sample site is then obtained by \nsubtracting the present depth of the sample from its maximum burial depth (Figure 6).  \nThe present day stratigraphical succession in the Firth of Forth basin is not at maximum depth of \nburial (Figure 6) and is incomplete, thus phases of deposition, uplift and erosion during the \nMesozoic and Cainozoic periods are inferred. Therefore, the adopted compaction curves were \nderived from data used in earlier studies of the Cheshire Basin (Chadwick et al. 1999) and the \nWessex Basin (Chadwick 1985), supplemented by theoretical data. \n24\/3\/09  14\/38 \nThe reliability of this method depends on the observed sample densities being due solely to \nsediment compaction. However, other factors may alter the density of sedimentary rocks, such as \nrecrystallisation of limestones or changes in the cementation of sandstones. Previous studies (e.g. \nMarie 1975; Magara 1976) indicate that the best depths of burial estimates are obtained from \nmudstones. \nEight boreholes with a reasonable depth of penetration and density logs were selected from the \navailable borehole data in the study area (Table 1 and Figure 1). For each borehole, the gamma-\nray log was used to define a shale-line and so indicate mudstone-dominated intervals. Such \nintervals were rejected if the calliper log indicated significant amounts of caving. The shale-line, \nas calculated from the gamma log, was compared to the lithological \u2018picks\u2019 by the site geologist \nor CORIBAND log (calculated lithological log), where available, and found to be in broad \nagreement.  \nModern density logs were compensated for borehole diameter effects by the logging service \nproviders, but older logs required manual compensation, a possible source of error as the \ncompensation charts are plotted on a logarithmic scale and it is difficult to estimate accurate \nvalues. Log calibration is also a significant source of uncertainty; density logs are relative-value \ntools and scaling in terms of absolute density values requires careful calibration. Different tools \nand calibration sources can yield significantly different results. \nThe density vs. depth data were plotted against, and compared to, the standard compaction \ncurves for mudstone and mudstone with 10% sandstone. The thickness of eroded overburden \ncould then be estimated from the vertical offset of the borehole data from the standard curve \n(Figure 6). Table 1 summarises the results of the depth of burial study, showing the maximum \ndepth of burial and thickness of eroded overburden at each of the selected borehole locations. \nA common procedure for assessing the reliability of overburden estimates is to add them to the \nobserved depths for a basin-wide stratigraphical horizon. If this produces a smooth surface, then \nthe overburden estimate can be considered consistent. However, in this case, the data were not \n24\/3\/09  15\/38 \nsuitably evenly distributed and so a qualitative assessment was made as part of the overburden \nmapping. A contour map of the estimated overburden was produced using the values in Table 1 \nand taking into account the overall structural trends of the Midlothian-Leven syncline. These \ncontours were then digitised and gridded (Figure 7).  \nEach BasinMod borehole model included apportioned thicknesses of sediment deposited and \nremoved during inferred post-Carboniferous phases of subsidence, uplift and erosion. However, \nthere is insufficient evidence to realistically extend such apportionment to the overburden \nmapped in the depth of burial study. A single layer was therefore used in the HotPot model to \nrepresent all deposition from end Carboniferous until about 60 Ma before present and its \nsubsequent erosion. The lithological composition of the overburden (Table 2) was estimated \nfrom preserved Mesozoic and Cainozoic strata in basins in England and the North Sea. \nHotPot burial history modelling \nInput data \nThe areal extent of the HotPot model is shown in Figure 1, and the spatial resolution of the \nmodel grid was 1 km. These parameters and depth data were obtained from the mapping of \nstructural evolution in the Firth of Forth presented by Ritchie et al. (2003).  \nThe stratigraphical table for the model (Table 3 and Figure 2) illustrates the main stratigraphical \nunits for the Firth of Forth basin and the grouping of the formations for HotPot basin modelling. \nThe Hotpot layer parameters by stratigraphical unit are given in Table 2.  \nBurial history modelling results \nThe results of backstripping the present day stratigraphy are shown in Figure 8. The eroded \noverburden layer is represented by an unconformity marker at the top of the 0.5 Ma column and \nis reconstructed as a deposited layer at the top of the 60 Ma column.  \n24\/3\/09  16\/38 \nThickness maps of backstripped and decompacted strata are shown in Figure 9 to illustrate stages \nin the development of the basin. The maps use a common contour scale for ease of comparison. \nThe Limestone Coal to Passage formations model layer (Figure 9a) is the lowest unit interpreted \nover the whole area so this was used to illustrate the development of the basin from 316 Ma to 60 \nMa before present when the maximum depth of burial was attained. Data quality was poorer for \nthe deeper horizons, which may have introduced artefacts into the grids during the original \nstructural modelling; such artefacts tend to be exaggerated by the decompaction computation. \nNevertheless, the pattern observed is sufficiently distinct to suggest that the development of the \nbasin conforms to a two-stage scenario, with initial rapid subsidence in small, discrete sub-basins \n(Figures 9a and 9b), followed by slower, broad, basin-wide subsidence (Figures 9c and 9d). This \nis typical of an extensional or divergent margin setting but could be compatible with a strike-slip \nsetting (Miall 1999, chapter 9; Allen and Allen 1990, chapters 3, 5 and 7). Figure 9a illustrates \nthe initial subsidence phase, with sub-basins apparent in the central and eastern part of the area \nduring deposition of the Kinnesswood, Lower Limestone, Limestone Coal and Passage \nformations. The transition to a thermal relaxation type subsidence began as the Scottish Middle \nCoal Measures Formation was deposited (Figure 9b), with a blanket of sediment starting to form \na single depocentre. This continued through the accumulation of the Upper Coal Measures \n(Figure 9c) and was projected until the maximum depth of burial was reached at 60 Ma (Figure \n9d). \nBurial history plots were extracted from the stacked HotPot grids. Figure 10 shows a burial \nhistory plot near the basin depocentre. Other burial history plots were extracted for comparison \nwith the BasinMod plots. \nRates of deposition were estimated for the Carboniferous strata (Table 4) for the decompacted \nHotPot layers.  \n24\/3\/09  17\/38 \nHotPot thermal modelling \nThe second, thermal history modelling stage of HotPot uses a method of 1D vertical heat \ntransfer, which is applied successively to each stack of grid nodes to compute the temperature \ndistribution at the base of each layer at each stage of the depositional history. \nAdditional input data \nThe thermal conductivity of sedimentary rocks is dependent on lithology, and increases with \ndepth and temperature up to around 300 \u00b0C, after which the change becomes negligible. A set of \nthermal conductivity vs. depth vs. lithology curves, derived from the observed, near-complete \nMesozoic to Neogene sequence in Denmark (Balling et al. 1981), and used in an earlier study of \nthe Cheshire Basin (Chadwick et al. 1999), has been adopted here. \nHeatflow measurements have been made in the Firth of Forth basin area. However, these \nobservations are too sparsely distributed to produce a reliable heatflow map of the area and so \nthe value of 53 mW m-2 for the present day heat flow at Edinburgh (Rollin et al. 2002) has been \nadopted basinwide for this modelling. As the Firth of Forth basin is small, and heatflow variation \nin the SE of Scotland is gradual, this is believed to be valid. \nEstimating the palaeo-heatflow is problematic. The assumptions were that the late Palaeozoic \nbasin development took place in a dominantly extensional regime, that the basin was largely \nunaffected by Mesozoic extension (which formed basins to east and west of Scotland but seems \nto have left the mainland as a high) and that there was some heat input during the Cainozoic \nigneous episode. The validity of these assumptions in the light of modelling results is discussed \nbelow. The sediment-starved (tectonic) basin subsidence values obtained from the HotPot burial \nhistory modelling indicate initial subsidence was in the range 1200 \u2013 1400 m in the central part \nof the basin. When the basin reached maximum depth of burial, the tectonic subsidence reached \nabout 2100 m. These subsidence rates would be consistent with a McKenzie (1978) extensional \nmodel having stretching factor \u03b2 \u2248 1.5, which has been adopted here for construction of the basic \n24\/3\/09  18\/38 \nheatflow vs. time profile. An instantaneous extension at 360 Ma before present was assumed at \nthe start of the curve. A local heatflow pulse incorporated at 60 Ma before present represents \nheat input due to Cainozoic igneous activity. The baseline of the curve has been shifted to yield \nthe observed present day heatflow of 53 mW m-2. The heatflow vs. time profile constructed is \nshown in Figure 11. \nThe present day average annual surface temperature of the Firth of Forth area is approximately \n9 \u00b0C (Meteorological Office, 2004). This has also been assumed as the likely average surface \ntemperature 0.5 Ma before present when deposition of the superficial deposits began. From late \nPalaeozoic through the Mesozoic to early Cainozoic times Britain migrated progressively \nnorthwards from equatorial latitudes due to continental drift (Trewin and Rollin, 2002) and was \nmuch warmer than at the present day. Thus, a constant value of 20 \u00b0C has been adopted for \nsurface temperatures from 60 Ma to 355 Ma before present.  \nThermal results \nA selection of the temperature maps produced from the modelling is shown in Figure 12. These \nillustrate the increase in temperature at the base of the Limestone Coal to Passage formations \nstratigraphical unit from immediately after its deposition (316 Ma before present) until \nmaximum burial (60 Ma before present). Comparison with the corresponding sediment thickness \nmaps (Figure 9) shows a broad agreement of temperature with total sediment thickness. Local \ndifferences are due to variations in thermal conductivity with the infill of the sub-basins (seen \nespecially in the 316 and 314 Ma maps, Figures 9a, b and 12a, b).  \nThermal history plots were extracted from the stacked HotPot grids at three grid nodes closest to \nthe sites used in the BasinMod modelling and compared to the BasinMod results.  \nThe burial and thermal histories may be combined to estimate likely geothermal gradients. \nTable 5 shows some estimates made for a series of grid nodes around the centre of the basin and \nat maximum burial, 60 Ma before present. The total thickness was obtained from the sediment-\n24\/3\/09  19\/38 \nloaded thickness grid and the temperatures are for strata at the base of the Lower Carboniferous \nsequence. From these, it is estimated that the likely geothermal gradient 60 Ma ago was about \n24.5 \u00b0C per kilometre. \n \nComparison of the BasinMod and HotPot results \nA limitation of the decompaction method of depth of burial analysis used with HotPot is that it \ncannot detect overprinting. Where preserved strata have been subject to a sequence of events that \nincludes more than one phase of deposition followed by uplift and erosion, this method can \npredict the maximum depth of burial but not during which period of burial it occurred. Neither \ncan it determine burial that occurred before overprinting. Thus in the Firth of Forth basin, all it \ncan predict is one apparent episode of deposition, stretching from Carboniferous to early \nCainozoic, followed by the uplift and erosion at 60 Ma before present. \nThermal calibration as used by BasinMod software allows modelling of the burial and heating \nthat occurred prior to Variscan uplift during latest Pennsylvanian. This was an important episode \nin the thermal history of the preserved strata, because the regional heatflow was probably then \nalmost at its highest, so any significant burial would have resulted in marked heating and \nmaturation of organic matter. Conversely, in the HotPot model, this episode is effectively \nignored leading to a possible underestimate of maturity and an estimation of much later timing \nfor thermal events. \nThe BasinMod results could be used to introduce the \u2018missing\u2019 phase of pre-Variscan deposition \nand erosion into the HotPot model. However, this would require much more extensive work with \nBasinMod, to construct models at a similar number of sites to the eight used in the HotPot depth \nof burial study, so that an isopach map could be constructed to represent the layer of eroded late \nCarboniferous strata.  \n24\/3\/09  20\/38 \nA comparison of the maximum burial depths and temperatures obtained from BasinMod and \nHotPot modelling at the borehole sites used with BasinMod is presented in Table 6. HotPot \ntemperatures and depths of burial are at base of Passage to Limestone Coal formations model \nlayer at 60 Ma before present in the period of maximum burial during the Cainozoic. BasinMod \ntemperatures and depths of burial are at the base of Limestone Coal Formation during maximum \nburial in the Cainozoic, except for in Tower 1 Borehole where the top of the underlying Lower \nLimestone Formation is not sampled.  \nIn comparison to the HotPot results given above, at the base of the Limestone Coal Formation, \nthe BasinMod models predict that during maximum burial (during the Cainozoic) the \ntemperature at the site of the Milton of Balgonie Borehole is about 95 \u00b0C with a maximum depth \nof burial 2300 m. The base of the Limestone Coal Formation is not seen in the Tower 1 \nBorehole, though around 227 m of Limestone Coal strata are observed compared to 244.8 m in \nthe Milton of Balgonie Borehole and 216.9 m in the Eskmouth Borehole. The thickness of the \nLimestone Coal Formation in this area is expected to be around 100-250 m (Cameron and \nStephenson 1985). On the basis of formation thickness in the other boreholes and expected \nthickness based on mapping of this formation, it was assumed that most of the formation was \nrecovered in the Tower 1 Borehole and the maximum depth of burial (2900 m) and temperature \n(110 \u00b0C) of the lowest strata observed in the borehole are likely to be similar to that which would \nbe shown by the model if the borehole had reached the base of the Limestone Coal Formation. . \nThe BasinMod model of the Eskmouth Borehole shows a maximum depth of burial of 2900 m \nand a maximum temperature of 115 \u00b0C at the base of the Limestone Coal Formation. The \nBasinMod and HotPot results at the site of Tower 1 Borehole and Milton of Balgonie Borehole \nare comparable. \nInterpretation of modelling results \nMiall (1999) gives a list of the properties usually associated with back-arc basins: deep marine \nsediment-fill; transition into slope and shelf facies on the continental margin of the basin; little \n24\/3\/09  21\/38 \nevidence of contemporaneous tectonics except normal faulting. Miall (1999) also gives a list of \nproperties usually associated with basins generated by transcurrent faulting; most basins are only \na few tens of kilometres across; strata are characterised by numerous local facies changes; \nmovement on individual faults may be local and spasmodic, so that sediments in adjacent basins \nmay have different stratigraphy; syndepositional features; the basin may be cut by later \ntranscurrent faults; sedimentation rates are rapid, commonly exceeding 1 m ka-1.  \nThe sedimentation rates of the Carboniferous strata for the BasinMod models are around \n0.1 m ka-1. Sedimentation rates computed from the HotPot model for this period show \nsedimentation rates rising from 0.2 m ka-1 to 0.6 m ka-1 (Table 4). The ranges of the \nsedimentation rate estimations from the two modelling procedures broadly agree, but are lower \nthan the indicative sedimentation rate given by Miall (1999) for pull-apart basins. Sedimentation \nrate for the Strathclyde Group from BasinMod is estimated at 0.13 m ka-1 in Milton of Balgonie \nBorehole and 0.11 m ka-1 for the HotPot Lower Carboniferous layer. This ties in with early \nCarboniferous active extension, rapid basin subsidence and volcanism (Ritchie et al. 2003). \nFrom the BasinMod sedimentation rate estimates, the Passage Formation (late Namurian to early \nWestphalian in age) generally appears to have a low sedimentation rate varying from 0.03\u20130.07 \nm ka-1 for Tower 1 and Eskmouth boreholes. It is laterally variable in composition and thickness \nand contains local unconformities related to tectonic instability (Read et al. 2002), possibly \nlinked to the reversal of movement on continental blocks associated with the closure of the Ural \nOcean (Coward 1993). The Passage Formation also includes the widespread, possibly eustatic \nMid-Carboniferous hiatus, so a low overall sedimentation rate probably reflects the presence of \nunconformities within the Passage Formation.  \nThe Upper Limestone and Limestone Coal formations (Namurian) deposited prior to the Passage \nFormation have a higher sedimentation rate in the BasinMod models of 0.13-0.19 m ka-1. The \nPassage to Limestone Coal formations HotPot model layer has a sedimentation rate of 0.18 \nm ka-1. The Westphalian HotPot layers show a high sedimentation rate estimate of 0.45-0.63 m \n24\/3\/09  22\/38 \nka-1. The BasinMod sedimentation rate estimate is lower at 0.1 m ka-1 for the Scottish Lower \nCoal Measures Formation in Eskmouth Borehole, south of the HotPot grid area and away from \nthe main depocentre. These sedimentary rocks were deposited during the post-extensional basin-\nwide thermal subsidence phase with localized inversion and growth folding (Ritchie et al. 2003). \nAs such, the relatively high sedimentation rates may reflect the growth folding visible on seismic \ndata of the Leven Syncline, linked to dextral strike-slip (Ritchie et al. 2003). Overall, the HotPot \nmodel shows strong evidence of extensional style initial synrift deposition in sub-basins \nfollowed by broad basin-wide thermal sag subsidence (Figure 9). Taking both the variability in \nsedimentation rates and the HotPot depositional model, the authors conclude that basin formation \nincluded both extensional and strike-slip components. However, it is difficult to conclude which \nprocess was dominant. \nThermal maturation and the oil window \nSmall quantities of oil and natural gas have been produced from Carboniferous rocks in the SE \nMidland Valley (Hallett et al. 1985). Along with proven occurrences in exploration wells, the \nhydrocarbons are trapped in anticlinal highs adjacent to the Midlothian-Leven syncline and \nsourced from the West Lothian Oil Shale Formation (Strathclyde Group) ( Figure 2; Underhill et \nal. 2008). Underhill et al. (2008) proposed both Carboniferous and Mesozoic maturation in the \noil generation window for Lower Carboniferous source rocks in their schematic burial history \ncurve. The data-based modelling presented here supports and expands that view.  \nThe BasinMod results imply that in the Eskmouth Borehole, the rocks of the Limestone Coal \nFormation and Lower Limestone Formation reached the oil window from the mid-Carboniferous \nonwards (Figure 4b) and that eventually all the strata up to and including the Scottish Upper \nCoal Measures Formation entered the oil window during mid-Cretaceous burial. Tower 1 \nBorehole shows the mid-maturity oil window being reached at a greater depth than in Eskmouth \nBorehole by the Limestone Coal and Upper Limestone formations during the Permian, with the \nScottish Lower Coal Measures Formation reaching the oil window during Palaeogene deep \n24\/3\/09  23\/38 \nburial (Figure 5b). Strata in the Milton of Balgonie Borehole show some of the greatest maturity \nvalues. Here the Strathclyde Group reached the oil window during the mid-Carboniferous and \nthe Lower Limestone Formation towards the end of the Carboniferous. The Limestone Coal \nFormation also appears to have reached the oil window during Cainozoic deep burial (Figure 5a). \nSome extremely high maturities are shown by the vitrinite reflectance localised around the \nMidland Valley Sill (Figure 5b). These have been discussed in more detailed by Raymond and \nMurchison (1988).   \nUnlike BasinMod, HotPot does not perform organic maturity modelling. However, maturity \nestimates may be obtained from HotPot models by displaying the temperature maps with a \npseudo-maturity scale, which distinguishes areas where strata reached under-mature (lower than \n100 \u00b0C), oil maturation (100 - 150 \u00b0C), gas maturation (150 - 220 \u00b0C) and over mature (higher \nthan 220 \u00b0C) burial temperatures. These maps are useful in indicating the likely extents of these \nzones at the various stages in a basin\u2019s development.  \nThe HotPot pseudo-maturity maps indicate that the Lower Carboniferous strata entered the oil \nwindow after 327 Ma before present (base Namurian), by 316 Ma before present (base \nWestphalian) about 50% of the mapped subcrop area was warm enough for oil generation to \noccur, and by 311 Ma before present (oldest Westphalian C; Bolsovian) all but a strip on the \neastern edge of the subcrop was capable of generating oil. The Passage to Limestone Coal \nformations entered the oil window in the period between 314 and 311 Ma before present (early \nPennsylvanian; Westphalian B Duckmantian), by the end of which about a quarter of the extent \nof the Carboniferous sequence was in the area above the 100 \u00b0C isotherm (Figure 13). The \nhigher Carboniferous strata had not entered the oil window by 311 Ma before present. The next \ntime reference in the HotPot model is 60 Ma before present (Figure 8), when maximum burial \nwas reached, and the entire Kinnesswood to Lower Limestone formations stratigraphical unit \nwas within the oil window, as was almost half the Passage to Limestone Coal formations \nstratigraphical unit. However, the HotPot model indicates that at this time only a small area \n24\/3\/09  24\/38 \naround the depocentre of the Scottish Lower to Middle Measures formations reached maturity, \nwith higher strata remaining under-mature.  \nBasinMod calculates maturity based on temperature and pressure. The burial history diagrams \nindicate that early maturity and oil generation is anticipated at lower temperatures for this \nmodelling package compared to those used for determining the maturity for the HotPot models. \nLowest Carboniferous strata are only present in the BasinMod model of Milton of Balgonie, this \nshows the Strathclyde Group reaching 100 \u00b0C around 327 Ma before present, which agrees with \nthe HotPot results. Eskmouth and Tower 1 boreholes do not sample the early Carboniferous \nstrata. However, the heat flow in these areas is modelled as higher than in Milton of Balgonie \nBorehole as the Limestone Coal Formation and Lower Limestone Formation appear to reach 100 \n\u00b0C during Jurassic deep burial, whereas in Milton of Balgonie Borehole, these formations do not \nreach 100 \u00b0C except for close to the sill. HotPot predicted that the Limestone Coal to Passage \nformations would reach 100 \u00b0C earlier than predicted by BasinMod (300 Ma before present in \nthe Eskmouth Borehole or 182 Ma before present in Tower 1 Borehole). BasinMod and Hotpot \nboth show the highest temperatures and greatest maturity during deep Palaeogene burial (with \nthe exception of strata close to igneous intrusions).  \nDiscussion \nBasinMod was used successfully to model three boreholes in the MVS using 420-660 m pre-\nVariscan additional deposition followed by Variscan erosion and then 1300-1800 m Permian to \nPalaeogene strata deposition followed by recent erosion. The selected boreholes could be \nsuccessfully modelled with the following strata thicknesses: Eskmouth Borehole using 450 m \ndeposited before the Variscan Orogeny, and then a further 1800 m deposited during the Permian \nto the Palaeogene periods subsequently eroded before present day; Firth of Forth Tower 1 \nBorehole with 420 m deposited before the Variscan Orogeny and 1750 m during the Permian to \nthe Palaeogene periods subsequently eroded before present day; Milton of Balgonie Borehole \n24\/3\/09  25\/38 \nwith 660 m deposited before the Variscan Orogeny and 1300 m during the Permian to the \nPalaeogene periods subsequently eroded before present day.  \nBasinMod plots of the thermal maturity vs. time indicate that the high heat flow associated with \nextension caused the most rapid increase in the maturity of the coals as indicated by vitrinite \nreflectance. Igneous intrusions were seen to have a localised heating effect on the surrounding \nrocks.  \nHotPot was used successfully to produce overburden and palaeo-temperature maps across the \neastern Midland Valley (Figures 9 and 12). The maximum depth of burial of the lowest \nCarboniferous rocks (Lower Limestone Formation and older strata) was calculated to be 5532-\n6049 m resulting in temperatures ranging between 140 and 147 \u00b0C across the basin centre. \nThe results of BasinMod and HotPot were compared at two sites: Milton of Balgonie Borehole \nand Tower 1 Borehole. In general, agreement between the BasinMod and HotPot models at the \ntwo chosen sites was reasonable, although BasinMod tended to predict greater temperatures. The \nBasinMod results at the base of the Limestone Coal Formation were compared to those obtained \nby HotPot for the Passage Formation to Limestone Coal Formation model layer. HotPot \npredicted a maximum depth of burial of 2498 m, with a temperature of 90 \u00b0C at Milton of \nBalgonie, compared to a maximum burial of 2300 m and 95 \u00b0C as predicted by BasinMod. \nHotPot predicted a maximum depth of burial of 2567 m with a temperature of 91 \u00b0C at Tower 1 \nBorehole compared to 2900 m and 110 \u00b0C predicted by BasinMod.  \nIn terms of thermal maturity of the basin, the HotPot model predicted the lowest Carboniferous \nstrata would reach the oil window (temperature above 100 \u00b0C) after 327 Ma before present (base \nNamurian), which agrees with the BasinMod predicted temperatures for Milton of Balgonie. \nHowever, the BasinMod model predicted that the Limestone Coal and Passage formations did \nnot reach 100 \u00b0C until burial during the Jurassic, which is later than predicted by HotPot. The \nHotPot model predicted that all the Lower Carboniferous strata and almost half the Passage to \n24\/3\/09  26\/38 \nLimestone Coal formations unit reached the oil window during maximum burial at 60 Ma before \npresent. BasinMod likewise predicts maximum maturity was reached during Cainozoic deep \nburial, with the exception of strata in contact with igneous intrusions. In general, BasinMod \npredicts higher maturity than HotPot, however, this discrepancy is partly a result of different \napproaches to calculating maturity. The temperatures and timing of maturation provide \nnumerical data to support the model of Underhill et al. (2008) for the generation of hydrocarbons \naround the Midlothian-Leven syncline. \nThe estimates of sedimentation rates are 0.03-0.44 m ka-1 from BasinMod and 0.2 m ka-1 rising \nto 0.6 m ka-1 from HotPot for the strata from the Lower Carboniferous into the Coal Measures. \nThe sedimentation rate estimates from the two modelling procedures broadly agree, but are \nlower than the characteristic sedimentation rate given in Miall (1999) for pull-apart basins. \nCarboniferous strata in the MVS show local variation in facies, split coal seams and at times a \nfairly rapid sedimentation rate. The HotPot model shows evidence of extensional style initial \nsynrift deposition in sub-basins followed by broad basin-wide thermal sag subsidence. These \nfactors lead the authors to conclude that basin formation was influenced by extensional and \nstrike-slip stresses. However, it is not possible to determine which process was dominant. \nBasinMod and HotPot are complementary modelling packages, using results from both can give \na more complete view of the sedimentary basin history than either package individually. The \nresults obtained here for the MVS could be improved on further if more time and more maturity \ndata were available to allow further iteration of the model results. In particular, use of BasinMod \nat additional sites would provide data to enable the single overburden layer used in the HotPot \nmodel to be subdivided, and thus allow HotPot modelling of the Variscan episode of uplift and \nerosion.  \nConclusions \nOverall, the agreement between the HotPot and BasinMod results is good, implying that the \nmodels produced represent a plausible geological history of the MVS. HotPot is useful for \n24\/3\/09  27\/38 \nmodelling across the basin using grids from structural interpretation, giving a \u2018broad-brush\u2019 \nhistory and overview. BasinMod allows each borehole to be considered in more detail. \nMaximum thermal maturity was reached during deep Palaeogene burial before recent uplift with \nthe exception of strata very close to igneous intrusions. Model results for sedimentation rates \nfrom both packages and current understanding of the geological evolution of this region \nindicated that Midlothian-Leven synclinal basin development was influenced by strike-slip and \nextensional stresses. \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors would like to thank Mike Browne and Maxine Akhurst, BGS Edinburgh, for their \nsupport and invaluable contributions to this paper, and Paul Lappage and Henry Holbrook, BGS \nKeyworth for their assistance with diagrams.
