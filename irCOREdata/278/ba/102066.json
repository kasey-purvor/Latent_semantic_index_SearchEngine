A reliable and e\ufb03cient method of distinguishing between chaotic and nonchaotic behavior in noise-\ncontaminated, but essentially stationary and deterministic, time series data has far reaching appli-\ncations. Recently, we proposed a new method of detecting chaos which applies directly to the time\nseries data and does not require phase space reconstruction. To illustrate the e\ufb00ectiveness of the\nmethod for experimental data, we analyze data from a bipolar motor.\nKey words. testing for chaos, deterministic dynamical systems, experimental data, nonlinear time series\nAMS subject classi\ufb01cations. 37M10, 65P20, 37D45\nDOI. 10.1137\/060672571\nThe standard technique of distinguishing between regular and chaotic dynamics in de-\nterministic time series data is to calculate the maximal Lyapunov exponent [1, 7, 14]. In\nthe case of physical and biological applications, where the underlying dynamics is unknown,\nphase space reconstruction [1, 7, 16, 18, 19] is a necessary \ufb01rst step in computing Lyapunov\nexponents. However, there are problems inherent in phase space reconstruction, as discussed\nin detail in [6, 17].\nRecently, we proposed a new method [9] of detecting chaos which applies directly to the\ntime series data and does not require phase space reconstruction. Moreover, the dimension\nand origin of the dynamical system are irrelevant. The input is the time series data and the\noutput is 0 or 1 depending on whether the dynamics is nonchaotic or chaotic. This 0-1 test for\nchaos is equally applicable to maps, ordinary and partial di\ufb00erential equations, and generally\nto data sets arising from deterministic systems. Of utmost importance is the e\ufb00ectiveness of\nthe method for experimental data. To illustrate our method we analyze data coming from an\nexperimental set up of a bipolar motor in an alternating magnetic \ufb01eld.\nWe \ufb01rst describe our test.

Later, we brie\ufb02y explain the justi\ufb01cation behind these\nclaims. For the moment, we suppose that the claims are correct and show how to proceed.\nThe form of our test (1) which involves only the observable \u03a6(n) highlights the universality\nof the test; the origin and nature of the data fed into the diagnostic system (1) are irrelevant\nfor the test. The method is independent of the observable; almost any choice of \u03a6 will suf-\n\ufb01ce [9]. Moreover, the dimension of the underlying dynamical system does not pose practical\nlimitations on the method as is the case for traditional methods involving phase space recon-\nstruction [17]. Of course, it is necessary (as with all other methods) that (i) initial transients\nhave died out so that the trajectories are on (or close to) the attractor at time zero, and\n(ii) the time series is long enough to allow for asymptotic behavior of p(n). In particular, it is\nrequired that the data is essentially stationary as well as deterministic. High-dimensionality\nof the attractor may impact (ii), since the time series must be su\ufb03cient in length that the\ndynamics explores enough of the attractor; but this is an intrinsic part of the problem and\nnot a drawback of the method.\nTo determine the character of the growth of the function p(n) de\ufb01ned in (1), i.e., its\ndi\ufb00usive behavior, it is natural to look at the mean square displacement of p(n), de\ufb01ned to\nbe M(n) = limN\u2192\u221e 1N\n\u2211N\nj=1 [p(j + n) \u2212 p(j)]2. If the behavior of p(n) is asymptotically\nBrownian, i.e., the underlying dynamics is chaotic, then M(n) grows linearly in time; if the\nbehavior is bounded, i.e., the underlying dynamics is nonchaotic, then M(n) is also bounded.\nThe asymptotic growth rate K of M(n) can be numerically determined by means of linear\nregression of logM(n) versus log n. This allows for a clear distinction of a nonchaotic and a\nchaotic system as either K = 0 or K = 1.\nTo justify the 0-1 test for chaos, note that the function p(n) can be viewed as a component\nof the solution to the skew product system\n\u03b8(n+ 1) = \u03b8(n) + c,\np(n+ 1) = p(n) + \u03a6(n) cos \u03b8(n),(2)\nq(n+ 1) = q(n) + \u03a6(n) sin \u03b8(n).\nHere (\u03b8, p, q) represent coordinates on the Euclidean group E(2) of rotations \u03b8 and translations\n(p, q) in the plane. It has been shown [13] that typically the dynamics on the group extension\nis sublinear and is (i) bounded if the underlying dynamics is nonchaotic and (ii) unbounded\n(but sublinear) if the underlying dynamics is chaotic. Moreover, the p and q components each\nbehave asymptotically like Brownian motion on the line if the chaotic attractor is uniformly\nhyperbolic [8]. A nondegeneracy result [13] ensures that for chaotic dynamics the variance\nof the Brownian motion is nonzero for almost all choices of c > 0 and observable \u03a6. Recent\nwork [12, 5] indicates that these statements remain valid for large classes of nonuniformly\nhyperbolic systems, such as He\u00b4non-like attractors. Roughly speaking, to obtain K = 1 it\nsu\ufb03ces that the underlying system has a faster than quadratic rate of decay of correlations\n[2, 4, 9].\nOne might ask why it is not better to work with, instead of the E(2)-extension, the simpler\nR-extension p(n+1) = p(n)+\u03a6(n), which can again be used to detect for chaos [9]. However,\np(n) grows linearly and it is necessary to subtract the linear term before computing M(n).\nAPPLICATION OF 0-1 TEST TO EXPERIMENTAL DATA 397\nFailure to do so produces the growth rate K = 2 regardless of whether the dynamics is regular\nor chaotic. The inclusion of the rotation \u03b8 kills o\ufb00 the linear growth.\nIn previous work [9] we illustrated the 0-1 test for chaos with numerically obtained data\nsets by simulating maps, ordinary di\ufb00erential equations, and partial di\ufb00erential equations,\nthereby showing the applicability to high-dimensional systems. Furthermore, we showed that\na modi\ufb01ed version of the test works very favorably for noisy systems when compared to\ntraditional phase space reconstruction methods [10]. Here, we demonstrate the e\ufb00ectiveness\nof the modi\ufb01ed test for experimental data.\nTo obtain experimental data, we constructed a bipolar motor, where a dipole magnet is\nsuspended in a spatially uniform, linearly polarized oscillating magnetic \ufb01eld [3]. The motor\nconsists of a short cylindrical ferrite permanent magnet located between a pair of Helmholtz\ncoils so that it is free to rotate about an axis normal to the magnetic \ufb01eld of the coils, with\nthe magnetic axis of the magnet perpendicular to the axis of rotation (see Figure 1). The\nmagnetic moment of this magnet was determined to be 3.70 joule\/tesla by measuring the\noscillation of the magnet in a \ufb01xed magnetic \ufb01eld. A magnetic \ufb01eld varying sinusoidally with\nfrequency \u03c9 and peak value 4.91 \u00d7 10\u22123 tesla was generated by driving the Helmholtz coils\nwith a Pasco PI-9587C low-frequency digital function generator\/ampli\ufb01er combination. We\nuse the frequency \u03c9 as a parameter. To measure the angular position \u03d1 of the dipole magnet,\nwe digitally recorded with a 25 frames\/second digital video camera a spot painted on an\naluminium disc mounted coaxially at the top of the rotor axle.\nThis experiment is the realization of the forced ordinary di\ufb00erential equation \u03d1\u00a8 + \u03b3\u03d1\u02d9 +\n(\u03bcB\/I) sin\u03d1 cos\u03c9t = 0, where \u03d1 is the angle between the dipole moment \u03bc and the magnetic\n\ufb01eld B, and I is the moment of inertia. Here, the damping is assumed to be proportional to\nthe angular velocity with a constant rate \u03b3. The observable \u03a6 in the experiment corresponds\nto the function cos\u03d1 (up to a constant phase).\nUsing \u03a6 = cos\u03d1 as our observable, we took recordings for 9 minutes, which amounts to\n13500 data points. We measured the autocorrelation of the data and found it to be over-\nsampled; the e-folding time [11] was \u03c4 = 5, and we therefore created a (shorter) time series\nconsisting of 2700 data points. (We note that when the data is collected over a small interval\nof time, it is important that the data is not oversampled, since the mean square displacement\nscales as M(n) = V n+ o(n), where V = 0 in the regular case and V \u0002 1 in the oversampled\nchaotic case.) We found that our test also works with a data set recorded over 3 minutes,\nwhich amounts to N = 900 data points after taking every 5th data point.\nIn Figure 2, we show experimentally obtained phase plots exhibiting periodic and chaotic\ndynamics for di\ufb00erent values of the frequency \u03c9. One may question the need for our test\nas one can clearly distinguish chaotic from regular dynamics by looking at the phase plots\nin Figure 2. However, this is possible only for low-dimensional systems, and even then it is\nproblematic for systems with quasiperiodic dynamics. We showed previously [10] that our\ntest distinguishes between quasiperiodic and chaotic dynamics in high-dimensional systems.\nIn this paper, it is our aim to show that the test works for real world problems which are\ninevitably contaminated by noise.\nTo illustrate the mathematics behind the test, we show in Figure 3 the bounded\/Brownian-\nlike dynamics of the translation components (p, q) of the E(2) extension (2) corresponding\nto the periodic\/chaotic dynamics in Figure 2. We made the arbitrary choice c = 1.95 in\n398 FALCONER, GOTTWALD, MELBOURNE, AND WORMNES\nFigure 1. Schematic diagram of the experimental setup of the bipolar motor.

In Figure 5, we plot K as a\nfunction of c where c is sampled uniformly with \u0394 c = 0.005 between 0.005 and 6.28.

Figure 5 illustrates this resonance\nphenomenon. To avoid these resonances distorting the \u201ctrue\u201d value of K, we perform the test\nfor several di\ufb00erent values of c and then take the median value of K. We use the median\nrather than the mean, since the median gives less weight to the strong outliers stemming from\nAPPLICATION OF 0-1 TEST TO EXPERIMENTAL DATA 401\n 0\n 0.05\n 0.1\n 0\n 1000  2000\nK\nN\n 0.5\n 0.75\n 1\n 0\n 1000  2000\nK\nN\nFigure 6.

In practice, 100 random choices of c su\ufb03ce [10].\nUsing the experimental data and the method described above, we computed K = 0.02 for\nthe case \u03c9 = 0.9Hz and K = 0.92 for the case \u03c9 = 0.6Hz, clearly indicating regular dynamics\nfor the \ufb01rst parameter value and chaotic dynamics for the second parameter value.\nIn Figure 6, we show the dependence of the median value for K as a function of N for\nboth cases. One can clearly see the improvement of the test with increasing N . Note that\nfor the regular case in Figure 6 (left), K is not converging to 0. This is due to the noise\npresent in our data. However, values of 0.02 are su\ufb03ciently close to 0 to allow for a binary\ndistinction with chaotic values around of K which exceed 0.9. (See [10] for a discussion on\ndata contaminated by measurement noise for our test.)\nWe have established a simple, inexpensive test for chaos and tested its e\ufb03ciency with an\nanalysis of experimental data obtained from a bipolar motor. The computational e\ufb00ort is\nof low cost, both in terms of programming e\ufb00orts and in terms of actual computation time.\nThis is a binary test that distinguishes purely between nonchaotic and chaotic dynamics by\nmeans of the quantity K taking values close to either 0 or 1. The most powerful aspects of our\nmethod are that there are no practical limitations arising from the nature and dimension of\nthe deterministic data under consideration (except the intrinsic problem, mentioned earlier,\nthat the time series needs to be su\ufb03ciently long that the dynamics explores enough of the\nattractor) and that the test is robust to contamination by noise.\nAcknowledgment.
