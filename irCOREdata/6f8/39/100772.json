INTRODUCTION\nOVER the past ten years SiGe heterojunction bipolartransistors (HBTs) have come of age as RF devices in\na range of commercial SiGe BiCMOS technologies [1]\u2013[6].\nThese technologies typically offer an SiGe HBT with a value\nof and around 100 GHz, and a range of passive\ncomponents specifically targeted at RF circuit design [7]. A\nwide range of RF and mixed-signal circuits have been designed\nin SiGe BiCMOS technology, including low-noise amplifiers,\npower amplifiers, mixers, voltage controlled oscillators, synthe-\nsizers, and high-speed analogue-to-digital and digital-to-analog\nconverters [2], [8]. Even higher frequencies of operation are\npossible with SiGe HBTs, as can be seen from state-of-the-art\nManuscript received September 9, 2004, revised December 17, 2004.

This opens up a second\napplication area in optical fiber communication systems oper-\nating at 10, 20, and 40 Gb\/s [10]. A typical product here would\nbe optical fiber to the curb or to the home. Silicon bipolar\nintegrated circuits have already been reported for 10 Gb\/s [11]\noptical communication systems and research is underway on\nboth Si bipolar and SiGe heterojunction bipolar circuits for\n20 [12] and 40 Gb\/s [10], [13], [14] systems. A variety of\ncircuits have been realized, including dividers, multiplexers,\ndemultiplexers, preamplifiers, and decision circuits [10].\nRecently, there has been increasing interest in SiGe HBT on\nSOI technology [15]\u2013[19], which allows the complete dielectric\nisolation of the device by combining a buried oxide with deep\ntrench isolation. This approach reduces parasitic capacitances,\nleakage currents and the devices size. Furthermore, the SOI sub-\nstrate eliminates parasitic substrate transistors and latchup and\nhas the ability to reduce crosstalk, particularly when combined\nwith buried groundplanes [20], [21]. These benefits make SiGe\nHBTs on SOI attractive for mixed-signal RF applications.\nCollector resistance is a key issue in SiGe HBTs on SOI.\nBuried silicide layers in SOI have been demonstrated to offer\nlow resistance contacts and near ideal tics in silicon diode struc-\ntures [22]. These substrates have been proposed as a solution to\nthe collector resistance problem [22]\u2013[24] for a variety of de-\nvice applications. However, this concept has not yet been imple-\nmented in bipolar technologies and contamination issues associ-\nated with the use of buried silicides in front-end processing have\nnot been investigated. In this paper, we describe the fabrication\nand electrical tics of SiGe HBTs on bonded SOI incorporating a\nburied tungsten silicide collector layer to reduce the collector re-\nsistance. Process options for combining buried silicide collector\nlayers with buried groundplanes are also considered. Contami-\nnation issues from the buried silicide layers are investigated by\ncharacterization and modeling of the reverse collector\/base cur-\nrent\u2013voltage tics.\nII. SILICIDE SOI HBT CONCEPT\nFig. 1 shows the concept of the silicide SOI (SSOI) SiGe HBT\ntechnology. Key features of the technology are the inclusion of\na buried silicide layer above the buried oxide layer for reduction\nof collector resistance and a buried silicide groundplane below\nthe buried oxide layer for crosstalk suppression [20]. The n+\nburied layer is needed in the SSOI process to prevent the forma-\ntion of a Schottky contact between the buried silicide and the\nsilicon collector. The technology also features complete dielec-\ntric isolation of the transistor island using a combination of deep\ntrench isolation and the buried oxide layer.\n0018-9383\/$20.00 \u00a9 2005 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Schematic cross section of SiGe HBT on wafer-bonded SOI with buried silicide collector layer and buried silicide groundplane.\nFig. 2. Illustration of types of SOI collector. (a) SOI with buried n+ layer. (b) SOI with buried silicide collector layer (SSOI). (c) SOI with buried silicide collector\nlayer and buried silicide groundplane (GPSSOI).\nIn the technology in Fig. 1, a silicon collector is grown\nusing selective epitaxy (n-Si SEG) after completion of the\nwafer bonding processes in order to provide a well controlled\ncollector doping profile. The selective silicon collector is grown\nin the same growth step as the nonselective growth of the SiGe\nbase (p+ SiGe NSEG) and silicon cap layer. This combined se-\nlective and nonselective growth process will give good control\nof the collector profile without requiring a separate collector\nepitaxy process. Further details of the combined selective and\nnonselective epitaxy process are given in [25].\nIII. WAFER BONDING PROCESSES\nFig. 2 shows three process options for the SOI collector struc-\nture, including the SOI collector with an n+ buried layer (SOI)\nreported previously [17], the silicide SOI collector with a buried\nsilicide layer (SSOI), and the SSOI collector combined with a\nburied silicide groundplane (GPSSOI). In the SOI process, a\nstandard n+ buried layer is included above the buried oxide layer\nto reduce collector resistance, whereas in the SSOI process, a\nburied tungsten silicide layer, combined with an n+ buried layer\nis included above the buried oxide layer to reduce collector re-\nsistance. In the GPSSOI process, a buried silicide groundplane\nbelow the buried oxide is combined with a buried silicide col-\nlector above the buried oxide.\nFig. 3(a) shows the process flow required to produce a basic\nSOI collector. The process begins with a cm , 80 keV\narsenic implant into the active silicon wafer to form an n+ buried\nlayer. A thermal oxide, 0.5 m thick, is grown on the handle\nwafer, the implanted active and the oxidized handle are bonded\nat room temperature. After inspection the bonded pair receive a\nhigh temperature anneal at 1000 C for 2 h in a nitrogen envi-\nronment in order to increase bond strength. This anneal is the\nlargest thermal budget which will be experienced by the sub-\nstrate during HBT manufacture. Previous work has established\nthe stability of the tungsten silicide during thermal processing.\nThe silicide layer was shown to be free from agglomeration ef-\nfects for 2-h anneal schedules up to 1100 C [26]. The active\nsilicon substrate is then ground to 6\u20138 m, the final SOI thick-\nness of 1.5 m is achieved by precision polishing of the ground\nSOI layer.\nIn the silicide SOI process (SSOI) it is advantageous to have a\nthermal oxide as the buried oxide layer, and Fig. 3(b) shows how\nthis can be achieved. After the n buried layer is implanted in\nthe active wafer a tungsten silicide (WSi layer, nm,\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Process flows for (a) SOI collectors with buried n+ layer and (b) SOI\ncollectors with buried silicide layer.\nis deposited by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) at 370 C. A\npolysilicon layer m is then deposited on the tung-\nsten silicide. This polycrystalline silicon layer is polished to\nproduce a bondable surface, typically removing 0.3 m. The\nactive silicon substrate is then bonded at room temperature to\nthe oxidized handle wafer. The SOI is thinned as before while\ncompensating for the presence of the silicide\/polysilicon layers.\nFig. 4 shows how a buried silicide collector layer above the\nburied oxide layer can be combined with a silicide groundplane\nbelow the buried oxide layer (GPSSOI). The tungsten silicide\nlayer required for the groundplane is deposited on the handle\nwafer using chemical vapor deposition as shown in Fig. 4(a). If\nnecessary, the groundplane can be patterned using lithography\nand dry etching, as shown in Fig. 4(b). This is typically neces-\nsary beneath inductors to break up magnetically induced eddy\ncurrents. In order to incorporate a patterned ground plane into\nan SOI substrate a polysilicon layer is deposited over the pat-\nterned silicide layer and planarized using CMP, Fig. 4(d). An\nlow-pressure chemical vapor deposition tetraethoxysilane oxide\nlayer is then deposited over the planarized polysilicon as shown\nin Fig. 4(e) the deposited oxide will be the buried oxide (BOX)\nof the final SOI structure. This oxide layer is then polished to\nproduce a bondable surface and is bonded to the active silicon\nsubstrate Fig. 4(f). After bonding the active wafer is thinned as\nbefore.\nIV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nFig. 5 shows a cross section TEM image of the basic SOI\nbonding process at the completion of the device processing. The\nburied oxide layer can be seen as a dark band in the bottom\nleft hand corner of the picture and shows good contact with\nthe active silicon wafer. The thickness of the buried oxide layer\nis 0.51 m. The active silicon collector layer above the buried\noxide layer has been ground and polished to a final thickness\nof 1.4 m. The selectively grown Si collector can be seen in\nthe oxide window above the thinned active silicon layer. The\nnonselective SiGe base can be seen as a thin, dark line above\nthe silicon collector, and is polycrystalline over the field oxide\nlayer. The polysilicon emitter can be seen above the emitter Si\ncap layer and the top layer is a silicon dioxide layer deposited\nprior to contact and metal formation.\nFig. 6 shows a transmission electron microscope (TEM) cross\nsection of the combined SEG\/NSEG growth process. The selec-\ntive Si layer aligns very well with the top of the field oxide layer,\nthereby giving a very planar surface on which the SiGe base can\nbe grown. The nonselective growth process gives single-crystal\nmaterial over the collector and polycrystalline material over the\nfield oxide, which is later used for the base contact. The thick-\nness of the polycrystalline layer is thinner than the equivalent\nsingle-crystal layer, indicating that an incubation time is re-\nquired before polycrystalline material is deposited on the field\noxide. The SiGe base can be seen as a dark layer sandwiched be-\ntween two lighter silicon layers. The original growth interface\ncan be seen as a dark line at the same depth as the bottom of\nthe field oxide and is a significant distance away from the col-\nlector\/base junction. Thus collector\/base leakage currents will\nnot be present due to the intersection of the growth interface\nwith the collector\/base depletion region. The fringes at the top\ncorner of the oxide window indicate the presence of strain in the\nTEM foil. The location of the fringes at the top of the window\nsuggests that the selective epitaxy is the origin of the strain.\nFig. 7 shows a cross-sectional TEM of the as-fabricated SOI\nsubstrate incorporating the buried tungsten silicide WSi col-\nlector layer. The WSi layer is deposited by CVD using a gas\nmixture that ensures a silicon rich as deposited layer, ,\nas this improves the stability of the layer during high tempera-\nture processing. As deposited the layer exhibits a sheet resis-\ntance of 56 . On annealing the sheet resistance de-\ncreases significantly due to the transformation of the layer from\namorphous to the more conductive tetrahedral phase of WSi .\nThe effects of annealing on the sheet resistance are summarized\nin Fig. 8. Initially the decrease in sheet resistance is due to the\nformation of a conducting polycrystalline layer. As the temper-\nature increases, further decreases are attributed to grain growth\nand silicon diffusing out of the silicide layer. All anneals were\ncarried out in a nitrogen ambient for 2 h. For a silicide layer\nthickness of 200 nm an anneal temperature of 1000 C yields\na resistivity of 50 cm, which agrees well with the 40\u2013100\ncm range quoted in the literature.

This value of generation lifetime does not in-\ndicate significant degradation due to metal induced deep-levels\nso it can be stated that the buried silicide layer has not had a\nserious impact on collector leakage. The variability in the col-\nlector current could either be due to the presence of the buried\nsilicide, to the selective epitaxy process used for the growth of\nthe collector or to a combination of the two. It is difficult to dis-\ntinguish between these two possibilities without further work.\nFig. 11 shows a typical output tic of a SiGe HBT with a tung-\nsten silicide buried collector layer (SSOI HBT), as shown in\nFig. 1. For simplicity of processing, the device did not include\na buried silicide groundplane. The value of collector resistance\ncan be estimated from the slope of the tic at low values of col-\nlector\/emitter voltage. For the tic shown, a value of collector re-\nsistance of 150 was obtained. To investigate the variation of\ncollector resistance across the wafer, measurements of collector\nresistance were made at a selection of chip sites across the wafer,\nFig. 11. Typical output tic of a SiGe HBT fabricated over a buried tungsten\nsilicide collector layer (SSOI device). The emitter area was 15\u0002 15 \u0016m.\nTABLE I\nCOLLECTOR RESISTANCE ON DIFFERENT CHIP SITES FOR SiGe HBTS\nFABRICATED OVER A BURIED TUNGSTEN SILICIDE COLLECTOR LAYER (SSOI\nDEVICES). THE EMITTER AREA WAS 15\u0002 15 \u0016m\nand values are summarized in Table I. Extracted values of col-\nlector resistance lie within the range 90\u2013255 . These values\nare high compared with typical values for SiGe HBTs on SOI\nsubstrates, which are typically between 17 and 35 [16], [19].\nFig. 1 shows that number of terms contribute to the value of\ncollector resistance, including the vertical series resistances of\nthe n-Si collector, the wafer bonded n-Si active layer and the\nn+ buried layer beneath the SiGe base, the lateral resistance of\nthe buried silicide layer, the vertical series resistances of the n+\nburied layer, the wafer bonded n-Si active layer and the n+ col-\nlector contact, and finally contact resistance. Since the lateral\nseries resistance of the buried silicide layer is very small, the\ndominant terms are likely to be the vertical resistances of the\nn-Si active layer and the n-Si SEG layer. Of these two terms,\nthe resistance of the n-Si active layer is likely to be the cause of\nboth the high values of collector resistance and the variability\nin the collector resistance across a wafer, because it is difficult\nto accurately control the thickness and the uniformity of the\ncollector layer using the grind and polish processes. More re-\nproducible values of collector resistance could be obtained by\ndiffusing the n+ buried layer up to the surface of the active Si\nwafer during the bond anneal. In this case, nonuniformities in\nthe grind and polish process would give rise to variations in the\nthickness of the n+ buried layer, which should be a small com-\nponent of the collector resistance. The value of collector resis-\ntance would then be determined by the thickness of the selective\nSi collector layer, and since this layer is grown by epitaxy, vari-\nations in thickness across a wafer should be small.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

CONCLUSION\nA technology has been described for the fabrication of SiGe\nHBTs on wafer-bonded SOI substrates containing a buried tung-\nsten silicide layer for collector resistance reduction or a buried\nsilicide groundplane for crosstalk suppression. A resistivity of\n50 cm has been achieved for a buried tungsten silicide\nlayer after an anneal of 120 min at 1000 C. Contamination\nissues associated with the buried tungsten silicide layer have\nbeen investigated by characterizing the collector\/base reverse\nI\u2013V tics of SiGe HBTs. Leakage currents in the range 100 fA\nand 10 pA are measured and a generation lifetime of 90 ns is\nobtained by fitting a tic from the middle of the leakage current\nrange. This value of lifetime is consistent with the collector\ndoping concentration of cm , and indicates that the\nburied silicide layer does not have a serious impact on junction\nleakage current. Collector resistances have been measured on\nSiGe HBTs and found to vary from 90 to 255 across a\nwafer. This variation has been attributed to nonuniformities\nin the grind and polish processes. A solution to this variation\nhas been proposed in which the buried n+ layer is diffused\nto the surface of the silicon during the bond anneal.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D. L. Harame, J. H. Comfort, J. D.
