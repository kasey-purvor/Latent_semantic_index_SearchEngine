For experimental reports on the observation of Jo-\nsephson vortices in grain boundaries with a p junction we\nrefer to Refs. 1\u20133. Kogan, Clem, and Kirtley4 also consider a\ngeneral case where the Josephson lengths of the junctions\nlJ\u2019s are not the same. Besides the f0 \/2 state, they also notice\nthe existence of multiple half-flux states\u2014i.e., sn\n+1\/2df0 , n=1,2.\nThe system of three Josephson junctions meeting at one\nend point has been considered first by Nakajima, Onodera,\nand Ogawa.5 The derivation of this system coupled via the\nboundary conditions using an electrical analog is given by\nNakajima and Onodera.6 The dynamic behavior of integer\nfluxes in this system with three junctions of the same type\nand with the same Josephson length has been discussed in\nRefs. 7 and 8.\nKnowing the eigenvalues of a state is of importance, also\nfor experimentalists, since one can then predict whether a\nparticular state can be observed in experiments or not. In this\npaper we will calculate analytically the linear stability of\nstatic (multiple) semifluxons sitting at or near the meeting\npoint of a tricrystal junction with one p junction. We will\nconsider the general case where the Josephson lengths are\nnot the same. As an example we will calculate the stability of\na 3f0 \/2 state. We use this state as a particular example since\nenergetically this state is preferable for some combinations\nof Josephson lengths, compared to f0 \/2 at the branch point\nplus f0 at infinity.4 Nonetheless, calculation of the energy of\nthis state does not establish the stability of it. In this report,\nwe will show that this state is in general unstable.\nThe time-dependent governing equation of the phase dif-\nference along the junctions is described by the perturbed\nsine-Gordon equation\nli\n2fxx\ni\n\u2212 ftt\ni\n= ui sin fi + aft\ni\n, s1d\nwith i=1,2 ,3 , x.0, t.0, and a is a positive damping co-\nefficient. The damping coefficient is not necessarily the same\nfor all the junctions. The subscript J of the Josephson length\nis omitted for brevity. The index i numbers the junction. The\nconstant ui represents the type of ith junction. Without loss of\ngenerality, we consider the case u1=\u2212u2=\u2212u3=\u22121. This\nmodels a tricrystal boundary with one p junction.

The right-hand side of Eq. (9)\nis plotted in Fig. 1, with k as parameter.\nThe above stability analysis shows that solution (4) can be\nstable. We cannot conclude whether the solution is linearly\nstable or not before analyzing the point spectrum.\nTo complete the analysis, our next task is to find the point\nspectrum v. The point spectrum consists of those values of v\nfor which there exist solutions vi to Eq. (6) with boundary\nconditions (7) that converge to 0 at \u2018.\nThe eigenfunction vi that corresponds to the eigenvalue is\nof the form10,11\nvisxd = ciemsx\u2212xid\/liStanhx \u2212 xi\nli\n\u2212 mD, m2 = v2 + av + 1,\ns10d\nwhere Resmd,0 and ci needs to be determined from Eq.

From the condition that Resmd,0, we obtain m\n=\u22121 or v=0,\u2212a with the corresponding eigenfunctions\ngiven by\nfv1,v2,v3g = f1,0,\u2212 1ge\u2212xstanh x + 1d = f1,0,\u2212 1gsech x ,\nfv1,v2,v3g = f1,\u2212 1,0ge\u2212xstanh x + 1d = f1,\u2212 1,0gsech x .\nThis result shows that there are quadruple eigenvalues at\nzero when the damping term is absent. A double-zero eigen-\nvalue bifurcates to the left half-plane when a is nonzero. The\nvalue m=0 gives bounded but not decaying eigenfunctions\nfrom which we obtain the edge of the essential spectrum\n[k=0 in Eq. (9)]. A sketch of the locations and the bifurca-\ntion of the point spectra is presented in Fig. 1.\nHence, we conclude that the solution given in Eq. (4) is\nlinearly stable.\nNext we will consider the general case of the 3f0 \/2 state\nfor any given combinations of Josepshon lengths. It is clear\nthat xi [see Eqs. (5)] can be either positive or negative, but\nnot all combinations of xi\u2019s satisfy the governing equation. In\nFig. 2, we show the sign-set diagram showing combinations\nof signs of xi that are needed for a solution to satisfy the\ngoverning equations.12 A solution with two +\u2019s has a higher\nHamiltonian energy [see Eq.

Asymptotic analysis shows that one root is less\nthan \u22121 if ul2 \/l1u!1 and ul3 \/l1u!1. In Fig. 3 we show\nnumerically that this result extends to general values of\nl2 \/l1 and l3 \/l1. Remembering that m2=v2+av+1, the two\nplots inform us that when the Josephson lengths differ, a pair\nof eigenvalues at the real line bifurcates from the quadruple\nzero. This implies instability if there is a Josephson length\ndifferent from the others. Further numerical analysis shows\nthat in this case the other zero eigenvalues move along the\nimaginary axis (with negative real part when a\u00de0). Solu-\ntions with one + have another pair of eigenvalues at the\nimaginary axis bifurcating from the edges of the continuous\nspectrum.\nThe calculation we have done shows that there is no\nstable 3f0 \/2 state in tricrystal junctions with one p arm,\nexcept at some unphysical combinations of the Josephson\nlengths. We have used numerical simulations of Eq. (1) to\nconfirm the result of our linear stability analysis. In the\nscheme we take ft\nisx ,0d=0 and fisx ,0d=f0i as the initial\nconditions. Indeed we observed the same result for the sta-\nbility or instability. In Fig. 4 we present the evolution of two\n3f0 \/2 states for a given value of li\u2019s.\nWith the above analysis, it can be easily shown that the\nf0 \/2 state is stable and the 5f0 \/2 state is unconditionally\nunstable.\nFIG. 2.

The release of an\ninteger fluxon moving away from the branch point shows the insta-\nbility of the state.\nBRIEF REPORTS PHYSICAL REVIEW B 69, 212503 (2004)\n212503-3\nOne can also show, using the same analysis, that the\n3f0 \/2 state will be unconditionally stable in the tetracrystals\nwith one p arm.3 One can also calculate that the 5f0 \/2 state\nwill be marginally stable in pentacrystals with one p arm.\nWe conjecture that a stable s1\/2+ndf0 state exists in 2sn\n+1d or more junctions connected to a joint with one of the\narms is a p junction. All the stable states require the maxi-\nmum field to be at the joint (see Fig. 1 in Ref. 4).\nTo summarize, we have described an analysis to study the\n(in)stability of a state in a tricrystal junction. We have con-\nsidered a special case\u2014i.e., 3f0 \/2 flux\u2014and shown that the\nstate is linearly unstable. According to the theory presented\nin Ref. 4 and combining the result with the stability analysis\nwe present here gives a clear explanation why a 3f0 \/2 state\nis never observed in experiments, especially in film\ngeometry.4 The stability analysis can be applied to discuss\nthe stability of solutions of other Josephson junction systems.\nWe also have written systems that can presumably have a\nstable s1\/2+ndf0 state.\nH.S. thanks T.
