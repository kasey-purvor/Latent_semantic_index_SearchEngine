Introduction 25 \nThe early Cenozoic was an interval of globally warm climate [e.g. Zachos et al., 2001, 2008; 26 \nPearson et al., 2007; Sluijs et al., 2008; Bijl et al., 2009], punctuated by a series of short-term 27 \nglobal-scale transient warming events known as hyperthermals [Kennett and Stott, 1991; Zachos 28 \net al., 2001, 2008; Cramer et al., 2003; Lourens et al., 2005; Nicolo et al., 2007; Agnini et al., 29 \n2009; Galeotti et al., 2010]. The most pronounced hyperthermal, the Paleocene-Eocene thermal 30 \nmaximum (PETM), reflects global-scale warming of both surface and bottom waters by ~5\u00baC 31 \n[Kennett and Stott, 1991; Zachos et al., 2003; Tripati and Elderfield, 2005; Sluijs et al., 2006]. 32 \nNegative carbon isotope excursions (CIEs) and carbonate dissolution horizons have been shown 33 \nto be coeval with warming during both the PETM and other hyperthermals [Lourens et al., 2005; 34 \nZachos et al., 2005, 2010], implying that a significant quantity of isotopically light carbon was 35 \ninjected into the exogenic system to cause the observed warming [Dickens et al., 1995; 1997; 36 \nSluijs et al., 2007; Panchuk et al., 2008; Zeebe et al., 2009]. However, the trigger mechanism for 37 \ncarbon release at the PETM is controversial, with several hypotheses proposed (see Sluijs et al. 38 \n[2007] for a review). Several authors have suggested that insolation maxima during the peak of 39 \n100 and 405 kyr eccentricity cycles resulted in warming of oceanic deep waters, causing the 40 \ndissociation of methane hydrates, thus instigating the warming event(s) [Cramer et al., 2003; 41 \nLourens et al., 2005; Sluijs et al., 2007]. Conversely it has also been suggested that the methane 42 \nand carbon dioxide which initiated the PETM were generated from contact metamorphism of 43 \norganic-rich sediments around intrusions in North Atlantic sedimentary basins [Svensen et al., 44 \n2004, 2010; Storey et al., 2007]; a trigger requiring no orbital forcing but coeval magmatism. An 45 \nunderstanding of the causative mechanism(s) for the PETM and later Eocene hyperthermals 46 \ntherefore requires a precise and accurate temporal framework within which the various records 47 \ncan be integrated in order to assess potential drivers (geologic and\/or astronomical).  Much 48 \n 4 \nprogress has been made through the construction of high-resolution proxy and lithologic 49 \nrecords from various OPD and IODP sites [Zachos et al., 2001; 2003; 2005; 2008; Sluijs et al., 50 \n2007; 2008], and the construction of orbitally-tuned timescales for these intervals have helped 51 \nelucidate the relative timing\/sequencing of different events [Lourens et al., 2005; Westerhold et 52 \nal., 2007; 2009; Westerhold and R\u00f6hl, 2009; Galeotti et al., 2010].  However, an outstanding 53 \nissue relates to the numerical age of key events, such as the PETM, which are currently 54 \nconsidered to be \u2018floating\u2019 \u2013 i.e. the age models contain only relative ages with respect to 55 \ncertain stratigraphic markers. This issue is the result of four factors: (1) the \u2018unstable\u2019 nature of 56 \nthe astronomical solutions in the early Paleogene, meaning that numerical ages derived from 57 \ntuning geological datasets to astronomical solutions carry high uncertainty [Laskar et al., 2004]; 58 \n(2) a gap in cyclostratigraphic records in the middle Eocene, meaning composite 59 \ncyclostratigraphic records for the entire Eocene cannot currently be constructed [Hilgen, 2008; 60 \nP\u00e4like and Hilgen, 2008]; (3) disagreement surrounding the length of the Paleocene Epoch as 61 \nderived from floating cyclostratigraphic timescales, with the presence of either twenty-four or 62 \ntwenty-five 405 kyr eccentricity cycles proposed [Kuiper et al., 2008; Westerhold et al., 2008; 63 \n2009; Hilgen et al., 2010], and (4) a lack of geologically well constrained radio-isotopic dates, for 64 \nboth the P\/E and K\/Pg boundaries and  associated magneto-chrons.  This is largely a result of 65 \nuncertainty in the 40Ar\/39Ar dating methods [Kuiper et al., 2008; Renne et al., 2010; Channell et 66 \nal., 2010] that are used to underpin Cenozoic timescales (note this uncertainty also prevents the 67 \naccurate determination of the number of 405 kyr cycles in the Paleocene). 68 \nThe current astronomical solutions are unstable prior to ~40 Ma owing to the chaotic nature of 69 \nthe orbits [Laskar, 1999; Varadi et al., 2003; Laskar et al., 2004; P\u00e4like et al., 2004]; therefore, 70 \nunlike the Neogene timescale, construction of a numerical geologic timescale for the Paleogene 71 \nrelies on radio-isotopic dating (primarily 40Ar\/39Ar and\/or U-Pb) of minerals (sanidine and\/or 72 \n 5 \nzircon) from volcanic ash layers [e.g. Wing et al., 2000; Luterbacher et al., 2004].  Time-series 73 \nanalysis of various proxy records (color, elemental, isotopic) permits identification of cyclicity 74 \nwithin sedimentary records that can be attributed to orbital (Milankovitch) forcing, which has 75 \npermitted the development of floating timescales for the early Paleogene [Lourens et al., 2005; 76 \nWesterhold et al., 2007, 2008, 2009; Westerhold and R\u00f6hl, 2009; Galeotti et al., 2010]. Such 77 \nfloating timescales can be constrained via radio-isotopic dating of minerals from volcanic layers, 78 \neither directly or by correlation (using bio- and\/or magento-stratigraphy).  At present 40Ar\/39Ar 79 \ndates underpin much of the Cenozoic timescale. However the accuracy of these dates is relative 80 \nto ages of the mineral standard used in their calibration - typically the Fish Canyon sanidine (FCs) 81 \nstandard, in addition to the potassium decay constants [Renne et al., 1998], both of which have 82 \nbeen the focus of ongoing research.  Attempts to calibrate the age of FCs using sanidines from 83 \nmultiple tuff layers with both 40Ar\/39Ar and astronomical ages, has resulted in an age of 28.201 84 \n\u00b10.046 Ma [Renne et al., 1998; Kuiper et al., 2008].  Renne et al. [2010] derive an age of 28.305 85 \n\u00b10.036 Ma for the FCs based upon a dataset of paired 238U\/206Pb (zircon) and 40Ar\/39Ar (sanidine 86 \nand biotite) dates for rocks where the minerals should give equivalent dates.  Furthermore, 87 \nChannell et al. [2010] used astronomical ages for Quaternary magnetic reversals, also dated by 88 \n40Ar\/39Ar, to derive an age of ~27.93 Ma for FCs.  These age estimates for the FCs do not overlap 89 \nwithin their quoted uncertainties, and combined indicate that the accuracy of 40Ar\/39Ar dates is 90 \n(at present) limited to ~1 %.  In contrast, the accuracy of U-Pb dates is relative to isotopic tracers 91 \nwhich can be accurately calibrated to SI units, and the decay constants that are known through 92 \ncounting experiments [Jaffey et al., 1971]. Precise isotope ratio determinations can therefore 93 \nresult in 238U\/206Pb (zircon) dates with total uncertainties of <0.2 % [Jaffey et al., 1971; Condon et 94 \nal., 2007].  Furthermore, transformation of mineral dates into eruption\/stratigraphic dates 95 \n 6 \nrequires interpretation of mineral date populations and consideration of petrology (i.e., magma 96 \nchamber processes, mineral closure temperature for retention of isotopes systematics).  97 \nCompounding the problem of Paleogene timescale calibration is the issue that the geological 98 \ncontext of radio-isotopically dated samples is somewhat uncertain with respect to the proxy 99 \nrecords being constrained.  As a result, recent numerical ages derived for the P\/E boundary 100 \nusing the recalibrated 40Ar\/39Ar radio-isotopic data and cyclostratigraphic datasets have yielded 101 \ninconsistent ages for the boundary [Kuiper et al., 2008; Westerhold et al., 2008, 2009], 102 \npreventing consensus on the duration of the Paleocene epoch and the exact temporal 103 \nrelationship of the PETM to potential geologic\/orbital triggers [e.g. Svensen et al., 2004, 2010; 104 \nStorey et al., 2007]. More robust constraints on the numerical age of the P\/E boundary are 105 \ntherefore required in order to (1) constrain the duration of the Paleocene Epoch, to ascertain 106 \nthe number of 405 kyr cycles within it and permit the accurate correlation of IODP, ODP and 107 \nDSDP cores, (2) anchor currently floating cyclostratigraphic records, and (3) constrain the exact 108 \ntemporal relationship between the PETM and potential triggers. 109 \nThe P\/E boundary is defined at the base of the 2.5-6 \u2030 negative CIE [Dupuis et al., 2003], coeval 110 \nwith the PETM. Typically, previous studies have only indirectly derived a numerical age for the 111 \nP\/E boundary [e.g. Wing et al., 2000; Luterbacher et al., 2004; Westerhold et al., 2007, 2008, 112 \n2009; Kuiper et al., 2008], owing to the absence of ash layers within the PETM CIE (the exception 113 \nbeing Jaramillo et al. [2010]; see Section 4.1).  Here we document a U-Pb (zircon) date from a 114 \nbentonite layer within the PETM CIE from the Longyearbyen section in the Central Basin of 115 \nSpitsbergen. We combine this date with cyclostratigraphic datasets, from both the 116 \nLongyearbyen section [Harding et al., 2011] and core BH9\/05 (drilled near Sveagruva, 117 \nSpitsbergen; Dypvik et al. [2011]), to constrain the age of the P\/E boundary. 118 \n 7 \n 119 \n2. Materials and methods 120 \n2.1 Geological succession 121 \nThe study localities are located in the Paleogene Central Basin of Spitsbergen, the largest island 122 \nin the Svalbard Archipelago, situated on the NW corner of the Barents Shelf (Figure 1; Dallman 123 \net al. [1999]; Harland [1997]). Harland [1997; and references therein] provides a comprehensive 124 \noverview of the stratigraphy of the Central Basin and the other Paleogene successions on 125 \nSpitsbergen. The stratigraphic nomenclature used in this report adheres to that proposed by 126 \nDallman et al. [1999]. During the Paleogene Spitsbergen was situated at ~75\u00b0N [Harland, 1997], 127 \nadjacent to the NE corner of Greenland, but with the progressive opening of the northern North 128 \nAtlantic a predominantly transpressional dextral strike-slip motion between the two continental 129 \nmasses was initiated in the Paleocene (Figure 1; Bruhn and Steel [2003]).  For the remainder of 130 \nthe Paleogene the Central Basin developed as a subsiding foreland basin [Kellogg, 1975; Helland-131 \nHansen, 1990; M\u00fcller and Spielhagen, 1990; Harland, 1997], the sediment shed from the rising 132 \nWest Spitsbergen Orogenic Belt resulting in a thick sedimentary succession (up to 2.5 km: 133 \nHelland-Hansen [1990]). 134 \nTwo sections were studied: the Longyearbyen outcrop section and core BH9\/05.  At 135 \nLongyearbyen the PETM lies within the Gilsonryggen Member of the Frysjaodden Formation 136 \n[Harding et al., 2011], a unit of around 250 m of homogeneous mudstones. A -4 \u2030 organic 137 \ncarbon isotope excursion (\u03b413CTOC) is present between 3 and 28 m above the top of the 138 \nHollendardalen Formation, with the coeval presence of the PETM-diagnostic dinoflagellate cyst 139 \nApectodinium augustum [Harding et al., 2011]. Two conspicuous bentonite horizons occur at 140 \n 8 \n10.90 and 14.60 m above the top of the Hollendardalen Formation, within the PETM CIE (Figure 141 \n2).  142 \nThe Frysjaodden Formation is identified from 551-110 m depth in core BH9\/05 [Dypvik et al., 143 \n2011], drilled NW of the town of Sveagruva near Urdkollbreen.  The cored succession cannot be 144 \ndivided into members due to the fine grained nature of the lithologies [Dallman et al., 1999]. 145 \nThe mudstone-dominated succession is continuous across the upper Paleocene-lower Eocene 146 \ninterval, with only minor amounts of carbonate detected in XRD analyses [Dypvik et al., 2011]. A 147 \n~4.2 \u2030 organic carbon isotope (\u03b413CTOC) excursion is present at the base of the Frysjaodden 148 \nFormation in core BH9\/05 (534-487 metres depth, see Figure 2; Cui [2010]), again coincident 149 \nwith two bentonite horizons lying at 517.20 and 511.10 metres depth respectively [Dypvik et al., 150 \n2011]. 151 \n 152 \nInsert Figures 1 and 2 here 153 \n 154 \n2.2 Palynological processing 155 \nSixty-six samples were processed in order to constrain the \u03b413CTOC excursion in core BH9\/05 156 \nusing dinoflagellate cyst (dinocyst) biostratigraphy. Sample processing methods were identical 157 \nto those of Harding et al. [2011], with the exception that no samples were subject to ultrasonic 158 \ntreatment. Concentrations of dinocysts were generated by counting 300 specimens where 159 \npossible, with normalisation against the out-of-count Lycopodium spike [Stockmarr, 1971]. 160 \nDinocyst taxonomy follows that of Fensome and Williams [2004]. The appearance of the 161 \ndinocyst Apectodinium augustum at the start of the \u03b413CTOC excursion firmly identifies the PETM 162 \n 9 \nin core BH9\/05, illustrating that the bentonite horizons in both the Longyearbyen section and 163 \ncore BH9\/05 are coeval (Figure 2). The PETM CIE from core BH9\/05 is plotted in Figure 3 to 164 \nillustrate the different phases of the CIE in Spitsbergen, with respect to ODP sites 690 and 1263. 165 \n 166 \n2.3 Radio-isotopic dating 167 \nAnalysis of the lower bentonite layer in the Longyearbyen section (sample SB01-1; Figure 2), was 168 \ncarried out at the he NERC Isotope Geosciences Laboratory (NIGL), UK. Zircons were isolated 169 \nfrom around 300 grams of sample SB01-1, using conventional mineral separation techniques. 170 \nPrior to isotope dilution thermal ionization mass spectrometry (ID-TIMS) analyses zircons were 171 \nsubject to a modified version of the chemical abrasion technique [Mattinson, 2005]. For details 172 \nof sample pre-treatment, dissolution and anion exchange chemistry at NIGL the reader is 173 \nreferred to Sl\u00e1ma et al. [2008]. Our U-Pb ID-TIMS analyses utilized the EARTHTIME 205Pb-233U-174 \n235U (ET535) tracer solution. Measurements at the NERC Isotope Geosciences Laboratory were 175 \nperformed on a Thermo Triton TIMS. Pb analyses were measured in dynamic mode on a 176 \nMassCom SEM detector and corrected for 0.14 \u00b10.04%\/u. mass fractionation. Linearity and 177 \ndead-time corrections on the SEM were monitored using repeated analyses of NBS 982, NBS 981 178 \nand U500. Uranium was measured in static Faraday mode on 1011 ohm resistors or for signal 179 \nintensities <15 mV, in dynamic mode on the SEM detector. Uranium was run as the oxide and 180 \ncorrected for isobaric interferences with an 18O\/16O composition of 0.00205 (IUPAC value and 181 \ndetermined through direct measurement at NIGL). U-Pb dates and uncertainties were calculated 182 \nusing the algorithms of Schmitz and Schoene [2007], combined with a 235U\/205Pb ratio of 100.18 183 \nand 233U\/235U double spike ratio of 0.99464 for the ET535 tracer.  All common Pb in the analyses 184 \nwas attributed to the blank and subtracted based on the isotopic composition and associated 185 \n 10 \nuncertainties analyzed over time. The 206Pb\/238U ratios and dates were corrected for initial 230Th 186 \ndisequilibrium using a Th\/U[magma] of 4 \u00b11 applying the algorithms of Sch\u00e4rer [1984]  resulting in 187 \nan increase in the 206Pb\/238U dates of ~100 kyrs and an additional uncertainty contribution of 188 \n~10 kyrs.  Errors for U-Pb dates are reported in the following format: \u00b1X(Y)[Z], where X is the 189 \ninternal or analytical uncertainty in the absence of all systematic error (tracer calibration and 190 \ndecay constants), Y includes the quadratic addition of tracer calibration error (using a 191 \nconservative estimate of the 2  standard deviation of 0.1% for the Pb\/U ratio in the tracer), and 192 \nZ includes the quadratic addition of both the tracer calibration error and additional 238U decay 193 \nconstant errors of Jaffey et al. [1971]. All analytical uncertainties are calculated at the 95% 194 \nconfidence interval.  These 238U\/206Pb dates are traceable back to SI units via the gravimetric 195 \ncalibration of the EARTHTIME U-Pb tracer and the determination of the 238U decay constant 196 \n[Jaffey et al., 1971; Condon et al., 2007]. 197 \n 198 \nInsert Figure 3 here 199 \n 200 \n2.4 XRF time-series 201 \nFe and Mn time-series were generated for core BH9\/05 using a Niton UK XL3t portable XRF 202 \nscanner.  Measurements (n=1195; Auxiliary Table 1) were taken every 20 cm throughout that 203 \npart of the core section recording the \u03b413CTOC excursion (550 m to 480 m core depth) and every 204 \n40 cm outside this interval (Figure 4).  Twelve samples were analyzed using wavelength 205 \ndispersive (WD) XRF, to calibrate results from the Niton UK scanner.  These samples were 206 \ncrushed to a fine powder and air dried at 105 \u00baC.  The sample (0.5 g \u00b10.0003) was mixed with 5 207 \n 11 \n\u00b10.003 g lithium tetraborate flux (Fluxana GmbH, Germany) and fused at ~1100 \u00baC using a 208 \nVulcan fusion system (HD Elektronik und Elektrotechnik GmbH, Germany) to provide a 1:10 glass 209 \nbead.  The glass beads were analysed using a Philips MAGIX-PRO automatic sequential 210 \nwavelength dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometer fitted with a 4 kW Rh X-ray tube. Loss on 211 \nignition (LOI) was estimated from the function (100 %- \u03a3 XRF oxides) since the original XRF major 212 \nelement calibration was constructed on this basis. We obtained correlation coefficients (r2) 213 \nbetween the WD XRF and the Niton UK scanner of 0.76 for Fe and 0.89 for Mn (Figure 5). 214 \n 215 \n2.5 Time-series analysis 216 \nBoth Fe and Mn time-series were first smoothed using a 5-point moving average in order to 217 \nreduce noise.  Log Fe and Mn values were used in order to stabilize cycle variance, with the data 218 \nalso normalized and detrended before spectral analysis [Weedon, 2003]. Gaussian filtering and 219 \ntuning were carried out using Analyseries version 1.1 [Paillard et al., 1996]. In order to generate 220 \nboth wavelet and multi-taper method power spectra, both Fe and Mn time-series were re-221 \nsampled using a constant sample spacing, via linear interpolation using Analyseries. Multi-taper 222 \nmethod power spectra [Thompson, 1982] were calculated using SSA-MTM toolkit [Dettinger et 223 \nal., 1995; Ghil et al., 2002] with a red noise model to assess confidence levels. Wavelet spectra 224 \nwere calculated using the Matlab script of Torrence and Compo [1998].  The time-series was 225 \nzero padded to reduce edge effects, with a red noise model to assess confidence levels 226 \n[Torrence and Compo, 1998]. 227 \n 228 \nInsert Figure 4 here 229 \n 12 \n 230 \n3. Results 231 \n3.1 Radio-isotopic dating 232 \nZircons separated from bentonite sample SB01-1 were small (<50 \u03bcm) with aspect ratios of ~3 to 233 \n~7. Thirteen single grains were analyzed, and the resulting data are presented in Auxiliary Table 234 \n2.  Three of the thirteen analysis produced discordant U-Pb data with Paleozoic 207Pb\/206Pb 235 \ndates.  The remaining ten analyses yielded 206Pb\/238U dates between 57.08 and 55.71 Ma (Figure 236 \n6).   U-Pb ages for volcanic ash beds are determined by the interpretation of U-Pb dates from 237 \nsingle zircon crystals.  Utilization of the chemical abrasion pre-treatment technique [Mattinson, 238 \n2005] for the effective elimination of Pb-loss means that we consider each zircon 206Pb\/238U date 239 \naccurate (i.e., they do not reflect post-crystallization Pb-loss).  Detailed studies of zircons and 240 \nother minerals dateable by the U-Pb system often indicate a protracted interval of zircon 241 \ncrystallization in a magmatic system, demonstrating the possibility that some zircon in a given 242 \nash layer record ages of the eruption (i.e., those that crystallized immediately prior to eruption) 243 \nand some older ages which reflect the pre-eruptive crystallization (and residence) of zircons 244 \n[Schoene et al., 2010].  In such samples the age of the youngest zircon (or zircon population) is 245 \nconsidered to best approximate the age of the ash layers with older zircon dates reflecting pre-246 \neruptive crystallization.  Excluding obvious inheritance of Paleozoic zircon, we observe a range of 247 \nzircon 206Pb\/238U dates in sample SB01-1 from 57.08 \u00b10.06 to 55.71 \u00b10.14 Ma, with the five 248 \nyoungest analyses yielding a weighted mean 206Pb\/238U date of 55.785 \u00b10.034(0.066)[0.086] Ma 249 \n(MSWD = 0.88, calculated using Isoplot 3.0 [Ludwig, 1991]) which is interpreted as being the 250 \nbest estimate for the zircons of this sample. We consider this date to best approximate the age 251 \nof sample SB01-1 and the older zircon 206Pb\/238U dates to reflect analyses of xenocrystic and\/or 252 \n 13 \nzircons that have experienced pre-eruptive magma residence, with the single analysis precision 253 \nof ~100 kyr permitting de-convolution of the mixed age population.  An alternative to the 254 \nconventional approach of taking a weighted mean date based upon a coherent population of 255 \nyoungest 206Pb\/238U dates would be to interpret the single zircon dates.  As the youngest five 256 \nanalyses form a coherent population this would have no discernable effect on the interpreted 257 \n206Pb\/238U date for SB01-1 and would increase the total uncertainty by an additional ~20 kyrs, 258 \nand as such our proposed date for SB01-1 is insensitive to different approaches to zircon date 259 \ninterpretation.  260 \n   261 \nInsert Figure 5 here 262 \n 263 \n3.2 Cyclostratigraphic analysis 264 \nA detailed description of the cyclostratigraphic age model for the Longyearbyen section can be 265 \nfound in Harding et al. [2011]. Here, numerical ages from Longyearbyen [Harding et al., 2011] 266 \nwere corrected using the numerical age of the bentonite. However, we also generated Fe and 267 \nMn time-series from core BH9\/05, with cyclostratigraphic analysis of this data discussed below. 268 \n 269 \n3.2.1 Records in the depth domain 270 \nIn order to build an orbital age model for core BH9\/05, it was first necessary to ascertain if the 271 \ncycles present in the time-series were derived from orbital forcing [Weedon, 2003; Bailey, 2009].  272 \nComparison of the Fe\/Mn time-series of core BH9\/05 with the TOC record from Longyearbyen 273 \n 14 \nillustrates that the same cycles are present in the depth domain in both different parameters 274 \nand localities within Spitsbergen [Figure 2]. This confirms the cycles present in the PETM are not 275 \npredominantly the result of stochastic noise [Weedon, 2003].  276 \nThe BH9\/05 time-series (Figure 4) illustrate a strong cyclicity within the interval from the base of 277 \nthe Frysjaodden Formation to the top of the PETM (551-487 m), with two dominant cycle 278 \nlengths of 4-6 m (~0.2 cycles\/m) and 20 m (0.05 cycles\/m) above 95 % confidence level (Figure 4; 279 \nnote that the short stratigraphic thickness of this interval with respect to the cycle wavelengths 280 \nbeing analyzed results in a wide bandwidth for the power spectra shown in Figure 4d, which has 281 \nthe effect of smearing out the spectral peaks). Above this interval the cycle wavelength 282 \nincreases, with components at 0.12 and 0.024 cycles\/m representing 8 m and 42 m cycles 283 \nrespectively (Figure 4). The wavelet spectra therefore suggest that the sedimentation rate 284 \nincreases above the PETM (as cycle wavelength increases when sedimentation rates rise). This is 285 \nin contrast to other PETM continental margin sections, which typically show an increase in 286 \nsedimentation rates within the PETM [e.g. John et al., 2008; Sluijs et al., 2008]. However, the 287 \nCentral Basin lies adjacent to the West Spitsbergen Orogeny, and thus the high volume of 288 \nsediment shed off the growing orogenic belt at this time [Harland, 1997; Dallman, 1999] 289 \nprobably overprinted any climatically induced changes in sedimentation. The increase in 290 \nsedimentation rates above the PETM is also consistent with the gradual infilling of the basin 291 \nthrough time, eventually leading to deposition of the overlying shelf margin delta and terrestrial 292 \nformations (Battfjellet and Aspelintoppen Formations respectively [see Dallman, 1999]). 293 \nIn order to estimate the duration of the Fe and Mn cycles, an independent estimate of the 294 \nsedimentation rate is required. Outside the PETM interval, no such constraints are currently 295 \navailable. Therefore, the rest of this study will focus on the interval between the base of the 296 \n 15 \nFrysjaodden Formation and the end of the PETM (551\u2013487 m), where the PETM CIE acts as an 297 \nexternal constraint on cycle durations. Note that the PETM CIE is a valid external constraint for 298 \nthe following reasons: (1) The CIE inflection points in \u03b413CTOC and \u03b4\n13Cn-alkane records in core 299 \nBH9\/05 are at stratigraphically equivalent heights [Cui, 2010], indicating changes in organic 300 \nmatter assemblage did not alter the stratigraphic position of the CIE inflection points. (2) The 301 \nabundance of reworked pre-Cenozoic palynomorphs is low throughout the lower Frysjaodden 302 \nFormation [Harding et al., 2011], indicating reworking of such material did not significantly alter 303 \nthe \u03b413CTOC record. Furthermore the consistent stratigraphy between Spitsbergen sites (Figure 304 \n2), suggests localized reworking of Paleocene organic matter did not significantly affect our 305 \nrecords (as differential reworking of isotopically heavy pre-PETM material would alter the 306 \ncarbon isotope stratigraphy between sites; Harding et al., [2011]). 307 \nThe stratigraphic thickness of the PETM CIE in core BH9\/05 (onset to the end of recovery phase 308 \nII: 533.66 m to 487.00 m) was combined with previously published data for the duration of this 309 \ninterval to calculate the sedimentation rate during the PETM. However, different estimates for 310 \nthe duration of the PETM CIE currently exist. R\u00f6hl et al. [2007] used cycles in Fe, Ca and Ba at 311 \nODP sites 1263 (Walvis Ridge) and 690 (Weddell Sea) to derive a PETM duration of 170 kyr (8.5 312 \nprecession cycles), which is similar to cyclostratigraphic results from the Bighorn Basin (157 kyr, 313 \n7.5 precession cycles; Abdul Aziz et al. [2008]). A recent re-appraisal of the 3He age model of 314 \nFarley and Eltgroth [2003] led to estimates from 90 \u00b110 to 140 \u00b130 kyr for the duration of the 315 \nPETM CIE at ODP Site 690 [Sluijs et al., 2007], with the upper estimate consistent with recent 316 \ncyclostratigraphic results. As similar durations for the PETM CIE have been derived from both 317 \nlow (Walvis Ridge), mid (Bighorn Basin) and high (Weddell Sea) latitudes it is reasonable to 318 \nassume that the duration of the event would have been the similar in the Arctic (170 kyr, sensu 319 \nR\u00f6hl et al. [2007]).  Given the 46.6 m thickness of the CIE (Figure 2) and assuming that its 320 \n 16 \nduration is 170 kyr yields a sedimentation rate of 27.4 cm\/kyr (4660 cm\/170 kyr). Using this 321 \nsedimentation rate the 4-6 m and 20 m cycles within the PETM represent 15-22 kyr and 73 kyr 322 \ncycles respectively. 323 \nHowever, recently Murphy et al. [2010] derived a duration of 217 +44\/-31 kyr for the PETM CIE 324 \n(onset to the end of recovery phase II) from ODP Site 1266 using an extraterrestrial 3He age 325 \nmodel. Potential reasons for the difference between this age model and that of R\u00f6hl et al. 326 \n[2007] were previously discussed in Murphy et al. [2010]. Using a duration of 217 kyr for the 327 \nPETM CIE (onset to the end of recovery phase II) together with the stratigraphic thickness of the 328 \nsame interval from core BH9\/05 gives sedimentation rates of 21.5 cm\/kyr (4660 cm\/ 217 kyr). In 329 \nthis scenario, the 4-6 m and 20 m cycles would have durations of 19-28 kyr and 93 kyr 330 \nrespectively. The duration of the 4-6 m cycles using either the R\u00f6hl et al. [2007] or Murphy et al. 331 \n[2010] age models is therefore consistent with their derivation from precession forcing. The 332 \nratio between the 4-6 and 20 m cycles suggests the 20 m cycle represents the short eccentricity 333 \ncomponent (~100 kyr), consistent with the cycle duration derived using the Murphy et al. [2010] 334 \nage model. The dominance of precession and eccentricity with a minor obliquity component in 335 \nlate Paleocene\/early Eocene sediments is typical and has been observed at numerous sites on a 336 \nglobal scale [e.g. Westerhold et al., 2007; 2008; Abdul Aziz et al., 2008; Sluijs et al. 2008]. 337 \nBecause of the different age models for the duration of the PETM CIE, we present two options 338 \nfor the interpretation of the cycles within core BH9\/05 (Section 3.2.2). We extracted the 339 \nGaussian filter outputs from the Fe and Mn time-series in the depth domain at wavelengths of 340 \n4.2 m (0.24 \u00b10.07 cycles\/m), and 20 m (0.05 \u00b10.01 cycles\/m; Figure 7). The 4.2 m and 20 m filters 341 \nrepresent the precession and short eccentricity components respectively, with precession cycles 342 \nnumbered according to R\u00f6hl et al. [2007]. Figure 7 shows that a minimum of 8.5 precession 343 \n 17 \ncycles are present within the PETM CIE (from onset to end of recovery phase II), consistent with 344 \nthe cyclostratigraphic age model of R\u00f6hl et al. [2007]. If we consider the R\u00f6hl et al. [2007] age 345 \nmodel to be the most accurate, the precession cycles labeled 1 to 3 in Figure 7 (i.e. excluding 346 \nthose marked with an asterisk) correspond to one short eccentricity (20 m) cycle. However, 347 \nbetween 4-6 precession cycles (typically 5) should be present for every one short eccentricity 348 \ncycle [e.g. P\u00e4like, 2005], and thus it is difficult to reconcile the two filter outputs in this interval. 349 \nFurthermore, we identify three additional cycles with low amplitude in the time-series and filter 350 \noutputs in the PETM interval (marked with asterisks) when compared to the R\u00f6hl et al. [2007] 351 \nage model (Figure 7). If these cycles are interpreted as low-amplitude precession cycles, the 352 \nduration of the PETM CIE is consistent with that obtained from the 3He age model of Murphy et 353 \nal. [2010; i.e. 11 precession cycles]. Using this approach the short eccentricity:precession cycle 354 \nratio is 1:5, consistent with orbital cycle ratios [e.g. P\u00e4like, 2005]. Two of the additional 355 \nprecession cycles occur within the interval between the PETM CIE onset and the end of recovery 356 \nphase I (making a total of 7 cycles; Figure 7), which is equivalent to the clay layer interval in ODP 357 \nLeg 208 sites (Figure 3). This is consistent with the hypothesis of R\u00f6hl et al. [2007], who argued 358 \nthat 5-7 precession cycles must be present within the clay layer interval of Leg 208 sites, in order 359 \nto maintain the phase of the 405 kyr eccentricity cycle extracted from Site 1262.  360 \n 361 \nInsert Figure 6 here 362 \n 363 \n3.2.2 Records in the time domain 364 \n 18 \nHere we construct two separate cyclostratigraphic age models for core BH9\/05 (from 551-487 365 \nm), each based on the different options for the duration of the PETM CIE from R\u00f6hl et al. [2007] 366 \nand Murphy et al. [2010]. Option A, matching the BH9\/05 records to the R\u00f6hl et al. [2007] age 367 \nmodel, was carried out by matching the Fe concentration record from BH9\/05 to that of ODP 368 \nLeg 208, Site 1263 (Westerhold et al. [2007]; corrected after R\u00f6hl et al. [2007]; Auxiliary Table 4), 369 \nusing the PETM CIE as an external constraint. The duration of the PETM CIE from the 3He age 370 \nmodel of Murphy et al. [2010] is longer than recent cyclostratigraphic estimates of the PETM CIE 371 \n[e.g. R\u00f6hl et al., 2007; Abdul Aziz et al., 2008], and therefore tuning the BH9\/05 record to 372 \nanother site consistent with this 3He age model is currently not possible. Therefore, in order to 373 \nbuild an age model for core BH9\/05 consistent with the results of Murphy et al. [2010], we 374 \nassigned a 21 kyr duration to the interval between each precession cycle peak, for each cycle 375 \nidentified in the filter output of Figure 7c (following a similar approach by Westerhold et al. 376 \n[2007] and R\u00f6hl et al. [2007]). Note that this approach assumes sedimentation rates remained 377 \nconstant between precession cycle peaks. Cycle peaks were assigned ages relative to cycle -1 in 378 \nFigure 7c, with the resultant age model (Option B) shown in Auxiliary Table 4. However, we note 379 \nthat precession cyclicity is quasi-periodic, with cycle durations ranging from 19-24 kyr in 380 \nduration [e.g. P\u00e4like, 2005]. Therefore we estimate an error of \u00b13 kyr for each precession cycle 381 \npeak utilized in age model Option B. 382 \n 383 \n3.3 The numerical age of the Paleocene\/Eocene boundary 384 \nThe P\/E boundary is defined as the base of the PETM CIE [Dupuis et al., 2003] and we therefore 385 \nintegrate the age of the bentonite with time-series datasets to constrain the age of the P\/E 386 \nboundary (and by inference the onset age for the PETM CIE). Numerical ages for both the 387 \n 19 \ncyclostratigraphic age models from Section 3.2.2 and the record from the Longyearbyen section 388 \n[Harding et al., 2011] were corrected using the age of the bentonite. In order to constrain the 389 \nage of the P\/E boundary, the relative duration between the dated bentonite horizon and the 390 \nonset of the PETM CIE is required. No grain size fluctuations or abrupt shifts in carbon isotope 391 \nvalues were observed within this interval in either the Longyearbyen section or core BH9\/05 392 \n(Figure 2), implying that sedimentation was continuous between the onset of the CIE and the 393 \nlower bentonite horizon. 394 \nFigure 8 shows the duration between the bentonite and base of the PETM CIE using age model 395 \nOption A for core BH9\/05 together with the cyclostratigraphic age model from the 396 \nLongyearbyen section [Harding et al., 2011]. Cycle counting using the Gaussian filter output of 397 \nprecession illustrates a 40 and 45 kyr duration between the lower bentonite and the base of the 398 \nPETM CIE in core BH9\/05 and at Longyearbyen respectively; which results in numerical ages of 399 \n55.827 \u00b10.086 Ma (BH9\/05) and 55.831 \u00b10.086 Ma (Longyearbyen) for the P\/E boundary (Figure 400 \n8). As each section was tuned independently, the 5 kyr difference between the ages derived 401 \nfrom each section partly represents the error associated with the tuning process. However, as 402 \nthe time-series from each section are constructed from different parameters (TOC% in 403 \nLongyearbyen; Fe and Mn concentrations in core BH9\/05), part of the 5 kyr offset may result 404 \nfrom differences in how the individual parameters were incorporated into the sedimentary 405 \nrecord. Therefore we incorporate the 5 kyr offset into the error for the age the P\/E boundary. 406 \nFurther error results from tuning the cyclostratigraphic records from Spitsbergen to the Fe 407 \nrecord of ODP Site 1263, because carbonate dissolution at the base of the PETM clay layer at 408 \nSite 1263 results in a minor hiatus in this section [Zachos et al., 2005; McCarren et al., 2008]. It is 409 \nestimated that the duration of missing time owing to carbonate dissolution is on the order of 10 410 \nkyr [R\u00f6hl et al., 2007], which we incorporate into the error, producing an age of 55.829 \u00b10.101 411 \n 20 \nMa (Figure 8). Conversely, using age model Option B for core BH9\/05 results in a duration of 81 412 \nkyr between the bentonite and the base of the PETM CIE (Figure 9), giving an age of 55.866 413 \n\u00b10.098 Ma for the P\/E boundary. The error based on age model Option B includes \u00b10.086 Myr 414 \nfrom U-Pb dating of bentonite SB01-1, and \u00b10.012 Myr error from cycle counting [4 precession 415 \ncycles at \u00b1 3 kyr per cycle; Section 3.2.2]). Note that no error for carbonate dissolution is applied 416 \nto Option B because this approach required no tuning to Site 1263, and the near absence of 417 \ncarbonate in the Frysjaodden Formation [Dypvik et al., 2011; Harding et al., 2011] implies that 418 \ncarbonate dissolution did not alter the Spitsbergen PETM records. The difference between age 419 \nmodel option A and B for the age of the P\/E boundary is thus ~37 kyr, and both options are 420 \nwithin error of one another because the accuracy of the radio-isotopic date dominates the 421 \nuncertainty of our derived P\/E boundary age.  Therefore the age of the boundary inferred here 422 \nis not significantly altered by large changes in the duration of the PETM CIE used to derive the 423 \nrespective age models. Taking into account both the cyclostratigraphic options and their 424 \nuncertainty, together with the uncertainty from the radio-isotopic dating of sample of SB01-1, 425 \nwe derive an age range of 55.728-55.964 Ma for the P\/E boundary (Figure 10). 426 \n 427 \nInsert Figure 7 here 428 \n 429 \n4. Discussion 430 \n4.1 Comparison with recent age estimates for the P\/E boundary 431 \n 21 \nOwing to the lack of direct radio-isotopic dating of the P\/E boundary (other than Jaramillo et al. 432 \n[2010], see below), earlier studies have derived numerical ages indirectly using either 433 \nastronomical solutions and\/or cycle counting from stratigraphic horizons which are themselves 434 \nconstrained by radio-isotopic dating. Three different astronomical age options have recently 435 \nbeen proposed for the P\/E boundary [Westerhold et al., 2007; 2008]. These options were 436 \nderived by extracting the 405 kyr cycle from both Fe and a* records from ODP Site 1262 (Leg 437 \n208, Walvis Ridge; Westerhold et al. [2007]). Combined with broad radio-isotopic age 438 \nconstraints the correlation of the extracted 405 kyr cycle to astronomical solutions [Varadi et al., 439 \n2003; Laskar et al., 2004] yields three different options each separated by one 405 kyr cycle 440 \n(option one: ~55.53 Ma; option two: ~55.93 Ma; option three: ~56.33 Ma). Note that three 441 \noptions were proposed due to the uncertainties associated with both astronomical solutions 442 \nand 40Ar\/39Ar radio-isotopic dating [Westerhold et al., 2007; 2008]. The error associated with 443 \neach option is \u00b120 kyr [Westerhold et al., 2007], derived from the error associated with the 444 \nextremely stable 405 kyr eccentricity cycle as calculated from astronomical modeling [Laskar et 445 \nal., 2004].  446 \nRecent ages for the P\/E boundary derived via cycle counting from radio-isotopic horizons have 447 \nutilized 40Ar\/39Ar (sanidine) dating of the K\/Pg boundary [Kuiper et al., 2008; Westerhold et al., 448 \n2008; Hilgen et al., 2010], and ash \u2013 17 in the Fur Formation of Denmark [Storey et al., 2007; 449 \nWesterhold et al. [2009].  As outlined in Section 1, the ~1 % uncertainty in the age of the FCs, 450 \nagainst which the 40Ar\/39Ar dates are determined, has precluded a high accuracy (<0.2 %) age 451 \nestimate for the P\/E boundary using this method. Together with the uncertainty for the duration 452 \nof the Paleocene Epoch from floating cyclostratigraphic timescales [Kuiper et al., 2008; 453 \nWesterhold et al., 2008; Hilgen et al., 2010]) this can therefore account for the difference 454 \n 22 \nbetween our age estimate and those recently derived utilizing 40Ar\/39Ar dates [e.g. Westerhold 455 \net al., 2008; 2009].  456 \nRecently, Jaramillo et al. [2010] obtained a 238U\/206Pb date of 56.09 \u00b1 0.13 Ma (total uncertainty) 457 \non zircons from a felsic pyroclastic tuff from a coastal plain Late Paleocene \u2013 Early Eocene 458 \nsection in Venezuela (Riecito Mache section). This pyroclastic tuff is at a level that records a 459 \nnegative CIE that is inferred to represent the PETM, and therefore inferentially constrains the P\/E 460 \nboundary to ~56.3 Ma [Jaramillo et al., 2010].  This date is ~400-500 kyr older than our age for 461 \nthe P\/E boundary.  The zircons utilized to derive this date were extracted from a sample described 462 \nas tuffaceous sandstone [Jaramillo et al., 2010; their Figure S3]. It is therefore possible that 463 \nfluvial reworking of detrital zircons from an eruption ~56.1 Ma could account for the discrepancy 464 \nbetween the Spitsbergen and Venezuelan P\/E boundary ages. In addition, the identification of the 465 \nPETM CIE at the Riecito Mache section is complicated by \u03b413CTOC records with a high degree of 466 \nscatter, and therefore an alternative explanation is that the dated tuffaceous sandstone was not 467 \ndeposited within the PETM CIE. 468 \nThe PETM CIE in Spitsbergen is firmly identified by \u03b413CTOC records together with the 469 \nApectodinium acme (Figure 2; e.g. Crouch et al. [2001]; Sluijs and Brinkhuis [2009]), and 470 \ndinocyst morphotype Apectodinium augustum, which only occurs within the PETM interval [e.g. 471 \nLuterbacher et al., 2004]. Given the accuracy of the U-Pb (zircon) system by isotope dilution, the 472 \ncontext of the dated sample within the PETM CIE and the proximity of the dated horizon to the 473 \nP\/E boundary, we consider our age range of 55.728-55.964 Ma for the P\/E boundary from 474 \nSpitsbergen to be the most accurate radio-isotopic age estimate. Our age range for the 475 \nboundary is within error of age option 2 of Westerhold et al. [2007; 2008] for the same horizon. 476 \nThe numerical age for the P\/E boundary (equivalent to the PETM onset) must fall within one of 477 \nthe age options proposed by Westerhold et al. [2007; 2008] in order to maintain the phase 478 \n 23 \nrelationship of the 405 kyr eccentricity cycle between astronomical solutions and records of the 479 \nsame cycle extracted from ODP Site 1262 [R\u00f6hl et al., 2007; Westerhold et al., 2007; 2008]. 480 \nTherefore, our age for the P\/E boundary substantiates age option 2 of Westerhold et al. [2007, 481 \n2008] is the correct option, giving a numerical age of ~55.93 Ma for the boundary. 482 \n 483 \nInsert figure 8 here 484 \n 485 \n4.2 On the age of the K\/Pg boundary 486 \nRadio-isotopic constraints at the K\/Pg boundary (e.g., single crystal 40Ar\/39Ar sanidine dates from 487 \nthe IrZ-Coal bentonite, Hell Creek Formation, Montana, [Swisher et al., 1993]) and immediately 488 \noverlying the P\/E boundary (Spitsbergen, this study) now bracket Paleocene time, constraining 489 \nits duration.  However, at present uncertainty in the numerical age of the monitor standards 490 \nused in the 40Ar\/39Ar studies that constrain the K\/Pg boundary (see Section 1) result in 491 \nuncertainties on the order of ~600 kyr or greater [Kuiper et al., 2008; Channell et al., 2010; 492 \nRenne et al., 2010] which precludes the accurate determination of the number of 405 kyr cycles 493 \nwithin the Paleocene.  Given our high-precision and high-accuracy constraint for the P\/E 494 \nboundary we suggest that the uncertainty of the numerical age of the K\/Pg boundary now 495 \nrepresents the most substantial source of uncertainty for constraining the duration of the 496 \nPaleocene. However, an alternative way to derive the age of the K\/Pg boundary is to use our P\/E 497 \nboundary age together with the duration of the Paleocene Epoch derived from 498 \ncyclostratigraphic studies. 499 \n 24 \nSuch cyclostratigraphic analyses of early Paleogene successions from ODP Legs 198 (Shatsky 500 \nRise, NW Pacific Ocean) and 208 (Walvis Ridge, SE Atlantic Ocean), together with ODP sites 1001 501 \n(Nicaragua Basin), 1051 (Blake Nose) and the Zumaia outcrop section (Basque Basin, Spain), led 502 \nto the development of an age model for the Paleocene where the K\/Pg and P\/E boundaries were 503 \nseparated by twenty-four 405 kyr eccentricity cycles giving a duration of 9.720 Myr [Westerhold 504 \net al., 2008].  However, recent analysis of the Zumaia outcrop section [Kuiper et al., 2008], 505 \nimplies that an additional 405 kyr eccentricity cycle (relative to Westerhold et al. [2008]) is 506 \npresent in the Paleocene epoch. A revised analysis of the Fe and magnetic susceptibility records 507 \nfrom ODP Site 1263 has also suggested twenty-five 405 kyr eccentricity cycles are present in the 508 \nPaleocene [Hilgen et al., 2010]. If we assume that the most recent cyclostratigraphic studies for 509 \nthe duration of the Paleocene are accurate (twenty-five 405 kyr cycles [Kuiper et al., 2008; 510 \nHilgen et al., 2010]), this would indicate a duration of 10.125 Myr for the Paleocene epoch. This 511 \nduration combined with our age range of 55.728-55.964 Ma for the P\/E boundary predicts an 512 \nage of ~66 Ma for the K\/Pg boundary. 513 \n 514 \nInsert Figure 9 here 515 \n 516 \n4.3 Implications for the PETM trigger mechanism 517 \nOur new age for the P\/E boundary allows us to investigate the relationship between the PETM 518 \nand potential forcing mechanisms. It has been proposed that insolation maxima during the peak 519 \nof both short (~100 kyr) and long (405 kyr) eccentricity cycles may have resulted in warmer 520 \nwater conditions, triggering the dissociation of methane hydrates on the seafloor, and thus 521 \n 25 \ngenerating hyperthermal events such as the PETM [Cramer et al., 2003; Lourens et al., 2005; 522 \nSluijs et al., 2007]. However, Westerhold et al. [2007] argued that the PETM occurred on the 523 \nfalling limb of a 405 kyr eccentricity cycle, based on records of the this cycle extracted from ODP 524 \nSite 1262. Here, we plot our age range of 55.728-55.964 Ma for the P\/E boundary (equivalent to 525 \nthe PETM CIE onset) against the astronomical solution of Laskar et al. [2004] to illustrate the 526 \nrelationship between the PETM onset age and 405 kyr eccentricity forcing (Figure 10). Orbital 527 \nmodels have illustrated that the 405 kyr eccentricity phase is stable over the entire Paleogene 528 \ninterval [Laskar et al. 2004], which validates our approach, although the relative cycle-to-cycle 529 \namplitude is less certain due to the chaotic nature of the solar system. The total uncertainty for 530 \nthe age of the PETM onset from Spitsbergen illustrates that the PETM was not initiated on the 531 \npeak of a 405 kyr cycle (Figure 10). In addition, it has been argued that the PETM onset age must 532 \nfall within one of the age options proposed by Westerhold et al. [2007; 2008] in order to 533 \nmaintain the phase relationship of the 405 kyr eccentricity cycle between astronomical solutions 534 \nand records of the same cycle extracted from ODP Site 1262 [R\u00f6hl et al., 2007; Westerhold et al., 535 \n2007; 2008]. Given our age range is within error of astronomical age option 2 (Figure 10), our 536 \nresults are consistent with the hypothesis that the onset of the PETM occurred on the falling 537 \nlimb of a 405 kyr eccentricity cycle [Westerhold et al., 2007]. Conversely, cyclostratigraphic 538 \nstudies of geological datasets have consistently placed ETM2 (equivalent to the Elmo event of 539 \nLourens et al. [2005]; or event H1 of Cramer et al. [2003]), ETM3 (or the X event of Zachos et al. 540 \n[2004]; event K of Cramer et al. [2003]) and other potential hyperthermals (negative CIEs of 541 \nCramer et al. [2003]) either on the maxima of both 100 and 405 kyr cycles [Lourens et al., 2005; 542 \nGaleotti et al., 2010] or with ETM2 at a 100 kyr eccentricity peak on the rising limb of a 405 kyr 543 \neccentricity cycle [Westerhold et al., 2007; Westerhold and R\u00f6hl, 2009; Zachos et al., 2010], 544 \nconsistent with orbital forcing as a common trigger mechanism. Therefore, the occurrence of 545 \n 26 \nthe PETM on the falling limb of a 405 kyr eccentricity cycle supports the hypothesis that the 546 \nevent required a different trigger mechanism when compared to other early Eocene 547 \nhyperthermals [Zachos et al., 2010]. 548 \nIt has also been proposed that the PETM may have been triggered by the injection of volcanic 549 \nsills into organic-rich sediments in the North Atlantic, generating methane and\/or carbon 550 \ndioxide via contact metamorphism, with outgassing through hydrothermal vent systems 551 \n[Svensen et al., 2004, 2010; Storey et al., 2007]. If correct, it would be expected that the 552 \nemplacement of these sills occurred immediately prior to the onset of the PETM. Recent 553 \nestimates for the emplacement of sills on the V\u00f8ring Plateau (55.6 \u00b10.3 and 56.3 \u00b10.4 Ma; 554 \nSvensen et al. [2010]) and for the eruption of mid-ocean ridge basalt-like flows in the North 555 \nAtlantic (55.5 \u00b10.3 Ma; Storey et al. [2007]) are within error of our new age for the onset of the 556 \nPETM. However, given the low uncertainty on our age for the PETM onset, age estimates with 557 \nequivalent uncertainties are required for igneous units in the North Atlantic, in order to fully test 558 \nthe hypothesis that volcanism was responsible for the release of the isotopically light carbon 559 \nwhich gave rise to the PETM.  560 \n 561 \n5. Conclusions 562 \nOur combined chemo- and bio-stratigraphic analysis enables the PETM to be recognized at two 563 \nlocalities in the Central Basin of Spitsbergen, and demonstrates that two coeval bentonite layers 564 \noccur within the PETM CIE at both localities. By integrating cyclostratigraphic datasets with 565 \nradio-isotopic dating (238U\/206Pb, zircon) of the PETM CIE, we derive similar numerical ages for 566 \nthe P\/E boundary based on two different options for the interpretation of the cyclostratigraphic 567 \n 27 \ndata. This approach yields a total uncertainty for the P\/E boundary (equivalent to the PETM CIE 568 \nonset age) between 55.728-55.964 Ma, which is within error of astronomical age option 2 569 \n[Westerhold et al., 2007, 2008]. Combined with models of the duration of the Paleocene 570 \nspanning twenty-five 405 kyr cycles [Kuiper et al., 2008; Hilgen et al., 2010], our new age range 571 \nfor the boundary predicts that the numerical age of the K\/Pg boundary is ~66 Ma. Furthermore, 572 \nthe new age for the P\/E boundary (PETM CIE onset age) provides additional constraints on the 573 \ntrigger mechanism for the PETM. Comparing our age range for the PETM CIE onset with the 574 \nLaskar et al. [2004] orbital solution indicates that the event was not initiated on a 405 kyr 575 \neccentricity peak. Furthermore, our age range is within error of astronomical age option 2 of 576 \nWesterhold et al. [2007; 2008], consistent with the hypothesis that the onset of the PETM 577 \noccurred on the falling limb of a 405 kyr eccentricity cycle [Westerhold et al., 2007]. Conversely, 578 \nother early Eocene hyperthermals have been inferred to occur on eccentricity maxima (or with 579 \nETM2 on the rising limb of a 405 kyr cycle) consistent with orbital forcing as a common trigger 580 \nmechanism. Our results thus suggest that the PETM was triggered by a mechanism different 581 \nfrom that proposed for the later Eocene hyperthermals. 582 \n 583 \nAcknowledgements: Store Norske Spitsbergen Grubekompani (SNSK) kindly allowed access and 584 \nsampling of core BH9\/05.

Grey bars illustrate the dominant cycles and their stratigraphic thickness. Note the 873 \nwide bandwidth on panel d is the result of the short stratigraphic thickness of the time-series 874 \nwith respect to the cycle wavelengths being analyzed (which has the effect of smearing out the 875 \nspectral peaks). Spectra were generated by re-sampling the time-series using a constant sample 876 \nspacing (0.2 m, panel d; 0.5 m, panel e), using 3 tapers.
