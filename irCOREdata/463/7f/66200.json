Based on a comparative case study, it \nidentifies different outcomes, from a single policy initiative in two localities. It argues, \nfollowing Jessop, that accounts which rest on inter-organizational relationships are \ninadequate, and that we also need to look at inter-systemic and inter-personal levels for \nmore complete explanations. Investigating the relationships between these levels, we \nderive an account of governance within which to situate the role of public involvement. It \nis against this background that we focus on why the methods of involvement deserve \ngreater attention for their substantive contribution to its quality and effectiveness. \nKeywords \nCommunity participation, public involvement, citizenship, governance, PCTs \nIntroduction \n \nThis article examines the role the public can play in the \u2018policy space\u2019 (King and Stoker, \n1996) created by the shift from government to governance, using insights from research \nin two primary care groups\/trusts (PCG\/Ts).  These organisations were inserted into an \nNHS said to be changing from its traditional monolithic, hierarchical form to a looser \n 1\nnetwork structure (Milburn, 2003)1. Burns et al (1994) have argued that the more \npluralistic institutional environment created by the move from hierarchies of government \nto networks of governance, offers better possibilities for democratic involvement  than \ntraditional representative systems. They suggest that \u2018an adequate democratic project \nmust centre itself upon recognition of the need for a plurality of power bases, modes of \nexpression and participatory forms\u2019 (p282).  Plurality alone, however, seems likely to be \ninsufficient to achieve the desired objectives. Research into public participation in \nprimary care has previously identified a danger that \u2018initial efforts to engage communities \nwill become little more than token gestures\u2019 (Alborz, Wilkin and Smith, 2002, p26) in \nview of the difficulties involved. As relationships of accountability change, the potential \nfor meaningful participation remains open to question. In their review of the role of \nparticipation in health care in the 1990s, for instance, Milewa et al (1999) argued that \ninvolvement was best conceived as based on \u2018active management\u2019 and professionalisation \nrather than active citizenship, because the citizen lacks the knowledge required to \nparticipate fully in the complex responsibilities of health care planning.  Our own \nempirical research (authors 2002) identified both the limited effect of exhortations to \ninvolve the public and the distinctive impact of the different ways in which PCTs \nengaged with them.  \nIn this article we suggest that an analysis founded solely in the democratic basis of \nlegitimacy ignores other motivations for public involvement. We draw on Jessop\u2019s \naccount of heterarchy and Bang\u2019s discussion of participation to identify a a range of \n                                                 \n1 498 PCGs were established during 1998, as subcommittees of Health Authorities, to cover \u2018natural \ncommunities\u2019 of 100,000 people. They had three main roles: to improve health; develop primary care; and \ncommission secondary care. General Practitioners chaired their Boards and were numerically dominant, \nthough nurses and social services were represented and there was also one lay member. PCGs were \nreplaced by PCTs, freestanding bodies with their own budgets, a lay chair and a lay majority on the board.     \n 2\nmotivations present within a stratified system. It is only by understanding their influence \nthat we can account for the particular place that participation holds in a given locality. \nBased in a critical realist approach to the interaction between structure and agency we \nargue that it is not diversity per se, but how relationships are structured in diverse \nenvironments, that is more significant in shaping the local space for public involvement. \nThe very indeterminacy of this space means that the approach chosen to channel \ncommunication between PCTs and the public can be critical in determining how far \nparticipation is real rather than token.  \nGovernance and Primary Care \n\u2018Reforms\u2019 to local government and the NHS in the 1980s and 1990s impacted \nsignificantly on local democratic accountability (King and Stoker, 1996). In particular, \nthey tended to overlay the direct accountability of elected representatives with self-\norganising networks of local organizations, mixed economies and partnership working, \nthereby shifting the emphasis from government to governance (Stoker, 1996, 2000). \nPublic involvement within the hierarchical structure of the NHS has historically consisted \nof limited agendas and formal advisory roles. Such initiatives were originally aimed at \nsecuring consumer feedback and advice (Griffiths, 1983; Department of Health 1992; \nWistow and Barnes, 1993). \n The public involvement policy embodied in \u2018Local Voices\u2019 (Department of Health, \n1992), advocated the importance of listening to local communities, but in practice, \nfocused primarily on developing methods of consultation about satisfaction with existing \nservices (Milewa, 2004). Yet, although a wide range of methods has been used, such \nexercises have yielded little information about user definitions of needs, priorities or \n 3\n 4\noutcome (Avis, Bond and Arthur 1997; Williams, Coyle and Healy, 1998; Dougall et al \n2000). More generally, evidence that involvement has a meaningful place in decision-\nmaking is sparse (Skelcher, 1993; Gilliatt, Fenwick, Alford. 2000; Farrell 2004).  As we \nhave shown elsewhere, these limitations can be explained by the underlying structures of \npower, which have permeated the NHS and its decision-making processes (Authors, \nforthcoming). Such relations of power were, in turn, linked to the relative influences of \nmedical or social models of health. To understand the role accorded to public \ninvolvement in primary care, it is necessary to understand the values and ideologies \nembedded in those structures and, consequently, in the methods adopted to advance it. \nHistorically, scientific rationalism   provided the dominant value structure in an NHS in \nwhich medical and associated clinical professions have prevailed. Harrison (2002) argues \nthat the process of modernisation in the service was similarly founded in \u201cscientific-\nbureaucratic\u201d values, that privilege randomised controlled trials and independently \nobserved, rather than patient experienced, measures. This approach has emerged, he \nsuggests, in order to manage an emergent consumerism.  \nWe suggest here that insufficient attention has been given to the impact of the shift to \ngovernance on public involvement in the NHS. Further, we argue the need to view \napproaches to involvement as both signalling and reproducing these changed bases of \nlegitimacy. We explore these ideas by reflecting on the divergent findings from case \nstudies in two localities, selected for similarity of locality profile, national policy \nframeworks and regional performance management structures. In particular, we seek to \nexplain our primary finding, the emergence of two distinct approaches to involvement, \neach implying different trajectories for public participation in local governance structures.  \n 5\nThe term \u2018governance\u2019 has been used so loosely that it has been described as, \u2018a \u201cweasel\u201d \nword- slippery and elusive, used to obscure not to shed light\u2019  (Bevir, Rhodes and Weller, \n2003. p41).  Conceiving of governance as providing \u2018policy space\u2019 is useful in expressing \nthe indeterminate nature of policy direction in self-organising governance networks. \nWhile policy may be defined centrally, it is implemented in a space determined by the \ninteraction of national and local factors rather than through specific prescriptions for \naction.    As a result, linearity and central direction have become inappropriate concepts \nfor understanding policy processes. The existence of a centrally defined policy to \nlegitimise the public voice is but one, admittedly important, element framing public \ninvolvement.  \nJessop defines governance as:  \n\u2018the reflexive self-organization of independent actors involved in complex \nrelations of reciprocal interdependence, with such self-organization being \nbased on continuing dialogue and resource-sharing to develop mutually \nbeneficial joint projects and to manage the contradictions and dilemmas \ninevitably involved in such situations, (Jessop, 2003. p1).  \nThis approach, he suggests, has the advantage, of distinguishing governance from \nmethods of central control or market exchange. It neither assumes symmetry in power \nrelations nor equality in the distribution of benefits. Jessop also argues that governance \nshould be conceptualised as heterarchy rather than focusing on inter-organizational \nnetworks alone.  Three forms of heterarchy are distinguished, based in: interpersonal \nnetworking; the self-organization of inter-organizational relationships and \u2018more  \nprogrammatic or mission oriented inter-systemic steering\u2019. These three forms are \u2018often \n 6\nlinked in tangled hierarchies\u2019 and, Jessop argues, the move toward governance is driven \nby increasing societal complexity in which legitimacy can only be sustained by the \nrepresentation of multiple stakeholder interests.  \nAssociated with each form of governance is a particular rationality. Heterarchical \ngovernance replaces the procedural rationality of the market and the substantive \nrationality of the state with reflexive rationality. In its very essence this rationality is \ndialogic. We will go on to argue that the nature of this dialogue in primary care, who is \nincluded or excluded, and how actors are involved, is both evidence of the basis of \nlegitimacy and is instrumental in producing it. \nHeterarchy and Primary Care \nIn government through hierarchy, the inter-systemic basis for legitimate involvement \ncomprises the direct expression of professional authority and the indirect expression  \npublic voice  through elected representatives and professionals. By contrast, in network \ngovernance, the direct voice of the public is, in principle, accorded increased legitimacy. \nOne of the stated aims of introducing PCTs was to enable the NHS \u2018to re-connect\u2019 with \nlocal publics (Department of Health, 2001).   \nThis formal objective was consistent with the view that governance can: \n\u2018be seen, in theory, as a means of promoting participatory democracy where \nexisting institutions are restructured and new ones are created, in order to \nmobilise and implicate more citizens and social groups in the management of \nlocal affairs  \n(Maloutas and Malouta, p456 2004) \n 7\n However, as these authors argue, its very flexibility leaves it open to manipulation by the \nbetter organised and more powerful, whether these be professionals, managers or, in \nsome cases, user groups.  We will suggest this vulnerability to colonization stems, in part, \nfrom contradictions existing within the heterarchical system and which, in turn, frame the \nspace within which public involvement is possible.  \n \nThe systemic level \nThe systemic level in Jessop\u2019s heterarchy is important in establishing the form of \ndemocratic legitimacy which underpins the whole system. While UK governance \nstructures have been seen to be developing in the context of an advancing neo-liberal \nideology and associated state practices, this process is not one-dimensional.  Milewa \n(2004) suggests that the UK welfare state represents a compromise between the extremes \nof \u2018individual responsibility\u2019  and \u2018enforced altruism\u2019. \u2018Enforced altruism\u2019 suggests a \npaternalistic state\/citizen relationship, while \u2018individual responsibility\u2019 identifies a non-\ncollective basis for the public\u2019s voice. In reality the system sustains strands of social \ndemocratic and neo-liberal types simultaneously (EspingAnderson, 1992) suggesting that \nboth bases of legitimacy remain relevant. This is reflected in the co-existence of both a \nhierarchical model of modernisation (Harrison, 2002) and the increasingly individualised \nbasis of organisation founded in consumer choice (6 and Peck, 2004)  \nThe changing role of the state and its relationships with the public as citizen\/consumer at \nthis systemic level necessarily underpins expectations about the proper role of \nstakeholders in governance.  Bang (2004) has introduced the notion of \u2018culture \ngovernance\u2019 to identify the divergence between the straightforward translation of neo-\n 8\nliberalism into New Public Management and the repoliticisation of the \u2018connections \nbetween the public institutions and everyday life\u2019 (p171).  The implication of Bang\u2019s \nargument is that we need to disentangle these grounds of legitimacy that have been elided \nin many discussions of involvement. While the public may be described as though it were \na single entity, the relationships of the state to the public as citizens and consumers need \nto be distinguished. Moreover, the co-existence of different frameworks of legitimacy is a \nsource of ambiguity, at locality level, about the status of those involved. In this context, \ntherefore, it is important to examine how accountability mechanisms are developing to \naccommodate the public\u2019s twin roles of citizen and consumer. \nInter-organisational level \nAt the inter-organizational and inter-personal levels, Primary Care Trusts work in \npartnership with other health and welfare organizations, with patients and the public in \nthe locality.  As newly formed organizations, PCTs had opportunities to join existing \nnetworks of service organisations and create new sets of relationships with users and the \nwider public. The requirement to focus on improving the health of individuals and the \npublic implied a departure from the traditional emphasis on direct service delivery toward \nunderstanding health status as the product of a wide range of socio-economic conditions \n(Department of Health, 2001, Wistow 2001). It is here that the normative connotation of \ngovernance, based in its apparent ability to overcome the fragmented responsibilities for \nthe NHS and the underlying socio-economic causes of ill health, assumes particular \nsignificance. To operationalise a social model of health, the public and patients must be \nincluded as stakeholders in these inter-organizational networks. At this inter-\norganisational level, however, Bang (2004) suggests that the primary motivation to \n 9\ninvolve the public lies in its ability to facilitate efficient service delivery rather than to \nextend public influence over new policy or service design. \n \nAt the inter-systemic and inter-organisational levels of health governance, therefore, two \nrelated processes are potentially occurring.  First, new relationships are being established \nbetween networks of state actors promoting public engagement as a means of enhancing \norganisational effectiveness, as exemplified in the notion of \u2018culture governance\u2019. \nSecond, a changing legitimacy is accorded to the public voice, deriving from the changes \ninherent in modernity and widespread challenge to the authority of the expert (authors \nforthcoming). \n \nInterpersonal level \nWhile the inter-personal level is often treated as the context in which agency can most \nreadily be detected, critical realism points to the presence of agency within structure, and \nof structure within agency. The relationship is expressed by Bourdieu who emphasises \nthe \u2018social at the heart of the individual\u2019 (p89,1992)), and we have discussed its impact in \nthe field of health elsewhere (authors forthcoming). Relationships operating at the \ninterpersonal level are shaped by, and shape, inter-organizational relationships and \ntogether they interact with the inter-systemic level as our empirical account will seek to \nshow.  \nHeterarchy, Primary Care and Public Involvement \n Exploring the concept of heterarchy and how it operates in practice helps us to \nunderstand why different outcomes emerge from similar inter-organisational structures. \n 10\nThe creation of a set of \u2018complex relations of reciprocal interdependence\u2019 cited earlier \n(Jessop 2003), necessarily yields structures that emerge from historical and local factors \nand are, therefore, widely divergent. In addition, Rhodes (1997) has identified the \ncontinuity of some hierarchical forms so that they coexist with network forms of \norganization. Turning to the role of the public, this complexity is compounded by the \ngaps between official discourses of involvement and the realities of implementation. \nAlthough interests outside traditional organizational structures are voiced, they have \nfrequently been colonized by managers and professionals to advance their own interests \n(Mort et al 1996, Mort and Harrison 1999, Milewa et al, 1998).   Indeed, the existence of \nmultiple rationales for public involvement itself suggests the absence of a clearly defined \nand accepted role for it.   In the subsequent account, our two case studies are used to \nreflect on how primary care organizations engage with the public. In doing so, we \nrecognise that both are grounded in the same inter-systemic context but suggest their \ninteraction with inter-organizational and inter-personal levels shape different \nopportunities for voice in each locality. We argue that we must consider the methods \nemployed to enlist involvement, not merely in terms of technical questions of \neffectiveness, but rather as signalling the nature of the local welfare system within which \nthey are embedded. Thus, the form of involvement achieved between boards and the \npublic is evidence of wider relations of governance including the competing claims of \nconsumerism and citizenship and the reconciliation of marketised and social democratic \nmodels. \n 11\nThe research \nOur empirical research was an NHS-funded exploratory study of ways  boards were \nbeginning to involve patients and the public in decision making. The reflections \ndeveloped in this article did not form substantive questions in the original enquiry, whose \nprincipal aim was merely to identify early approaches to involvement. The fieldwork \nevidence helps to illustrate the theoretical ideas developed out of that enquiry. \nThe research design was multi-method, including attendance at public and at three board \nmeetings in each locality, analysis of documents and unstructured interviews. The \nevidence below draws from twenty interviews, conducted with a range of board members \nincluding the Chair, Chief Executive, GP, Nursing and Lay members. For the purposes of \nthis article, we have identified respondents by locality and number because our focus is \nnot upon differences of approach within boards, but upon relationships between boards \nand communities. Further, our commitments to confidentiality, means that it is not \npossible, in a local study, to identify people according to role. \nTwo localities were selected on the basis of similarities in socio-economic profiles and \ngeography, location within a common national policy framework and subject to the same \nregional performance management regime. Yet, real differences in approach were \nemerging in which, even at an early stage, different value systems and relationships \nbetween primary care organizations and their communities were becoming evident. We \noutline these differences of approach before going on to consider their origins.  \nApproach to Involvement: Locality 1 \nLocality 1 had a significant rural population but it also contained a large urban centre. \nThis geographic structure may have been one element shaping approaches to \n 12\nconsultation. Historically, new initiatives had been aimed first at the urban population \nwhile those for the rural part of the locality had followed if, and when, funds permitted. \nConsequently, formal participatory requirements could be satisfied by accessing the \ncentral population. \nIn locality 1 the PCG had developed relationships with social services, housing \ndepartment and the voluntary sector, but conceived of consultation as gathering direct \nopinion on the services it offered. The board\u2019s focus was on the practical difficulties of \naccessing \u2018public opinion\u2019, conceptualised as being \u2018informed\u2019 versus being \n\u2018representative\u2019. The approach was to identify local opinion as merely one source of \nadvice for the board to consider in its decision making process, much in the way that \nMilewa et al (1999) relate in their research following \u2018Local Voices\u2019 (1992).  While this \nenables information to be gathered about the local community and its views, there is no \nreciprocity involved in the relationship established. The approach acknowledges inter-\norganisational and inter-personal networks which treat the public voice as subordinate. \n The necessary consequence of seeking representativeness on these terms was to define \nthe public as reactive, choosing between alternatives proposed by the board, registering \nwishes and beliefs for the board to take into account, but lacking any active voice in \nselecting the issues for consideration. \nApproach to Involvement: Locality 2 \nLocality 2, although also rural in character, had a different internal geographic profile, \ngiving rise to different organisational structures of governance. The population was \ndispersed over a distance of 40 miles but possessed no significant population centre in \nwhich to concentrate participatory processes.  Existing agencies had addressed this \n 13\nproblem by developing networks of sub-locality organizations based in thee \u2018natural\u2019 \ngeographical areas. Thus the PCG joined an established network structure which shaped \nboth its inter-organizational relationships and the interactions it established with the \npublic. \n \nIn Locality 2, the search for \u2018representative public opinion\u2019 was abandoned in favour of \ndeveloping processes of communication. This took the form of dividing the locality into \nthree \u2018natural communities\u2019. Based on the prior experience of other organizations the \nPCG saw these areas as internally coherent bases for consultation, through pre-existing \nnetwork structures linking communities, agencies and boards. Moreover, relationships \nwith the public were conceived as multiple, dynamic and developing. Their purpose was \nto achieve shared understandings within  complex and changing settings rather than \nfeedback through responses to pre-formulated questions. \n \nThe remainder of this paper aims to account for the different trajectories in public \ninvolvement that we have identified in localities sharing many structural features. We \nexplore, therefore, how far the framework sketched above might help us understand such \ndifferent outcomes. In particular, we consider how far  Jessop\u2019s (2003) definition of \ngovernance as heterarchy provides insights into the structures and processes through \nwhich significantly different  relationships between PCT boards and their publics could \nemerge. Three principal dimensions of similarity and difference  were identified from our \nfieldwork in the two localities: their conceptualisation of the public;  their selection of \napproaches  for public engagement; and their understanding of each PCT\u2019s role as \n 14\nimproving health services or improving public health. As we will demonstrate, these \ndivergences in thinking and understanding are themselves interdependent and mutually \nreinforcing, originating, as they do, in the extent to which scientific rationalism \npredominates at the systemic level of governance the NHS. \nDefining the public \nThe requirement to involve the public has been made clear by the Department of Health \nbut little has been specified beyond this general objective (Department of Health, 2001b).  \nPolicy guidance on the involvement of stakeholders has frequently conflated the roles of \npublic, patient, consumer and citizen (Department of Health, 2001). Yet, clarity about the \ngrounds upon which involvement is sought is crucial to understanding its purpose and \nintended consequences for decision-making. While the user may be consulted because of \ntheir specific experience of services, the public are consulted because of their status as \ncitizens. The rhetoric of New Labour has favoured an interpretation in which stakeholder \nstatus comes from membership of the community and the belief that participation \nreinforces the fabric of civil society (Newman, 2001;  Perri 6,2004). However, Bang \n(2004) argues that, at the inter-organisational level, the prime rationale for participation is \nimproving efficiency rather than democracy.  \n \nThe inter-systemic concern with democracy should, in principle, produce considerable \ncommon ground about involvement rooted in citizenship. Yet, we found major areas of \nuncertainty in both boards about the legitimacy of either citizenship or  consumerism as \nthe primary basis for  involvement and the forms that it took. Moreover, there was \n 15\nconsensus that their greater levels of knowledge and expertise justified the boards \nretaining  power over decision making: \nWe have to listen to everything and it doesn\u2019t mean that the public\u2019s views are any less \nthan anybody else\u2019s but they have to fit with the bigger picture \u2026.because that will \nestablish what our relative priorities are. ..(2:2) \nIt was frequently claimed that boards had the advantage of a wider view in making the \nmost \u2018rational\u2019 decisions about the use of resources, suggesting a hierarchical relationship \nwith the public remained appropriate. This finding supports Jessop\u2019s (2003) emphasis on \nthe unequal distribution of power within local governance systems. In both boards, \nprofessionals and managers placed emphasis on their responsibility to manage scarce \nresources effectively in the \u2018general\u2019 interest: \nIf we try to meet everybody\u2019s wishes as opposed to their needs \u2026, we are doomed to \nfailure. (1:2)      \nCounterposing unrealistic \u2018wishes\u2019 against well judged provision for \u2018needs\u2019 is clearly a \nclaim to authority based in enforced altruism.  While individual responsibility for health \nstatus was recognised, it was not used to support arguments for resource allocation and \nplanning \nThe difficulty in identifying \u2018the public\u2019 also led to questioning the value of consultation. \nSeen as an attempt to gain a view of the locality as a whole, the task was daunting, \nperhaps even impossible: \nOne is always aware that the people who perhaps shout loudest aren\u2019t necessarily \nrevealing the \u2026basic, more general needs of everybody but may be talking about their \n 16\nown needs\u2026.  But it is quite hard\u2026., with a large population, to get everybody\u2019s view.  \n(1:4) \nThis finding points up the possibility of governance failure. There is, at least, an apparent \ninconsistency in trying to insert the public, a body potentially at odds with itself, into \norganizational forms defined by Jessop as ones of \u2018reciprocal interdependence\u2019 to \ndevelop \u2018mutually beneficial joint projects\u2019  (2003). \n These concerns about the diversity of public views were common to members of both \nboards. Indeed, they severely inhibited their acceptance of either the citizen or consumer \nrole as a sufficiently legitimate basis for the public to shape decisions about health and \nhealth services compared with their own expert knowledge.  While this perspective might \nappear consistent with the notion of enforced altruism, it is not consistent with citizenship \nas the legitimate basis for decision-making. Rather, it reveals that it is the board that \ndetermines both the collective good and   the knowledge base on which such decisions \ncan legitimately rest. As will become apparent below, this knowledge base remains \nheavily influenced by traditional scientific rationalism.     \nApproaches to Public Involvement  \nCritical differences arose from the ways that the boards\u2019 views about the role of the \npublic interacted with   opportunities for communication and consultation within pre-\nexisting governance structures. We distinguished between the two localities as one \nseeking a \u2018snapshot\u2019 of local opinion and the other aiming to sustain a dialogue with the \ncommunity. Each approach affected the nature of governance and its products.  Signs of \nthis difference emerge in the routes to consultation taken in each locality and the \n 17\nsubsequent trajectories of involvement.  Each route both arises from, and reinforces, \ndifferent sets of relationships within the respective governance structures. \n  Locality 1: a snapshot \nIn locality 1 the board stressed the importance of informing the public of its activities and \ndecisions: \nI think a lot of the other PCGs are still holding alternate (open) board meetings.  But they \n(the board) said 'no let\u2019s do it, let\u2019s have it once a month in public - if we are going to \nhave a row  ...then let\u2019s have it'.  (1:1) \nPublic involvement was also defined as seeking an accurate view of opinion by including \na number of questions on the quarterly \u2018ratepayers\u2019 panel questionnaire in order to  \u2018get a \ngenuine local community public view of some of the big issues \u2026.    (1:2). the issue of \nrepresentativeness was primary and was being addressed in an attempt to capture \n\u2018genuine\u2019 public opinion.  \nI suspect that in fact 99% of it is going to be user\/carer involvement, quality monitoring, \nsatisfaction and all that sort of thing.  .. and only the borough council is going to be able \nto demonstrate public participation in terms of seeking views on policy development, \nprioritising and what have you.  (1:6) \nIn terms of the heterarchical framework, the board established an active relationship at \nthe inter-organizational level, supplemented by information drawn from a more \npassive\/responsive public voice. If the ratepayers\u2019 panel was the most accurate way of \naccessing public opinion, it was nonetheless considered less well informed than user \ngroups, with inevitable consequences for its credibility:  \n 18\n\u2026 there is going to be a sort of hierarchy with the panel, perhaps, I wouldn't say the \nlowest, but probably lower than some of the experienced public member groups. And then \nperhaps the professionals inevitably, perhaps, having more weight.  (1:6) \nThis approach is not straightforwardly statist. It allows for a New Public Management \napproach, which recognises the role of the public as consumer combined with continuing \nhierarchical deference to the professional. The significance of this hierarchy of \ninformants is intensified by a hierarchy of information. The authority accorded to the \n\u2018ratepayers\u2019 panel\u2019 was based on an assumption that there was an identifiable \u2018body\u2019 of \nopinion, which was real, relatively stable and could be harvested or gathered in. \nConsequently, the primary problem was how to collect evidence that spoke for the whole \npopulation. While involvement might be secured through a range of methods, they sat \nwithin an evidence hierarchy headed by representativeness. \n  The same hierarchy emerged in considering who should join the commissioning team: \n  What is a typical member of the public\u2026\u2026if you are trying to choose either one or two \nmembers of the public to represent 150,000 people?  And is there such a thing at all?  \n(1:5) \nThe consequence of seeking opinion in this way is that the possibilities\/agenda must be \npre-defined. The relationship emerging is that of a board engaging actively with its \norganisational partners but assigning a passive role to the public.  This reinforces a \nhierarchical dyadic relationship, separate from, and therefore not interacting with, the \nwider network of inter-organisational governance relationships . \n 19\nLocality 2: a dialogue \nIn locality 2, the representativeness of public views and the accuracy with which they \nwere captured were seen as less important: \nYou start to think, \u2018what sort of representative? Of what?\u2019\u2026.. and that\u2019s where I ended \nup in my disillusionment \u2026 \u201cto hell with this, we are never going to get the perfect \nrepresentation; let\u2019s go with what we\u2019ve got and be aware of the dangers\u201d (2:6) \n Consequently, advantage was taken of formal arrangements that already existed to link \ncommunities with agencies and boards, including networks of relationships between \ncommunity health workers, and the public in three localities..   \n..we\u2019ll have three locality managers \u2026and they will all have the role of getting to know \ntheir local communities and building up links with the agencies and voluntary \norganizations on their patch. (2:2) -  \nMoreover, the pre-existing relationships between organizations provided different \nunderstandings and experiences of what constituted participation. The networks included \nrelationships between organizations and the public at both local authority and small area \nlevel, thereby encouraging an approach in which patients and the public were perceived \nto be overlapping categories, containing people with multiple roles and relationships with \nlocal services.   \nUnless you\u2019re talking to patients you miss the stickiness of situations. You totally miss the \nfact that a patient isn\u2019t just a patient who has had a heart attack, they\u2019ve got bad backs, \nthey\u2019ve got arthritis, they\u2019ve got cancer, they\u2019ve got a mixture of the three \u2013 you know \nthey\u2019ve just had a bereavement themselves and it just seems to undermine the whole idea \nof a scientific approach to anything. (2:6) \n 20\nThis rejection of a notion of opinion as stable, separate and measurable is reflected in the \nrelationship being developed between agencies, the public and patients. \n.. we just have a health hat on when we look at the bit of the service we provide to them \nwithout realising the much wider range of services that they will tap into, starting with \ntheir own informal networks and carers at home\u2026\u2026(2:1) \nWhile the public\u2019s multiple roles were recognised in Locality 1, there were no \norganizational structures to reflect this understanding and enable it to shape \ncommunications. Separate relationships existed between the board and local \norganizations and between the board and the public: those with the public were therefore \nconstituted in dyadic rather than network form. In locality 2, such interrelationships \nbridged organizational boundaries in ways consistent with Jessop\u2019s (2003, p6) notion of \n\u2018metagovernance\u2019, defined as: \n\u2018managing the complexity, plurality and tangled hierarchies found in \nprevailing modes of co-ordination. It is the organization of the conditions of \ngovernance and involves the judicious mixing of market, hierarchy and \nnetworks to achieve the best possible outcomes from the viewpoint of those \nengaged in metagovernance\u2019.  \nThis influence was reflected in a discussion of the PCG\u2019s potential to become part of  a \nwider network of communications with the public: \nThere is so much going on in the different areas of our patch\u2026. we\u2019ve got regeneration \nzones from social services,\u2026 they\u2019ve all got their own... ..processes in place to \ncommunicate with the local public\u2026 I think we need to tap in on things like that and \n 21\nbecome part of it, so that people don\u2019t have to think too much about the boundaries of \nthese organizations \u2026 (2:5) \nIf the process of involvement is to become one of dialogue, then involvement in decision-\nmaking implies information exchange and debate from an early stage: \n\u2026..by involving people very early on because it is that that builds ownership to the \ndecisions \u2026.  So we tried to do that right from the early days with our strategy \n\u2026document, which was a very early view of some of the priorities in the patch, and at the \nbottom of every page, just about, was, \"this is what we think, what do you think?  (2:2) \n \nThis approach was further reflected in the creation of an organizational context that \nemphasised blurring traditional role boundaries: \n..part of the joint finance set-up organised by the local authority is the local working \ngroups with a multi-agency representation including the police, education, social \nservices, health and so on. And they are tailor-made for what the Primary Care Group is \ntrying to do which is build the bridges between all these agencies\u2026The community \ndevelopment worker will support those local working groups \u2026.and the locality manager \nwill join them as well and try and weld the whole lot together. (2:7) \nThe reflection of the locality-wide governance structures in these smaller area-based \ngroups has the potential to mediate (although not necessarily to redress) the imbalance of \npower between board and public and to bring both interests to the table. It legitimises \nexperience of the interaction of services as knowledge to be valued as compared with \nseeking information on isolated and direct service experience \n 22\nThe pursuit of involvement was consequently concerned with allowing flexibility to \nrespond to the outcomes generated by the complex inter-relationship of all three levels of \nheterarchy: \nAnd I think you need to take your opportunities.  You know, if something exists, you need \nto be in there and building on it and influencing it whether it is organised by another \nagency or not and it becomes part of your, to use the trendy term, virtual organization \n\u20262:2) \nHealth Service Improvement And Health Improvement \nOne of the core functions of the new Primary Care organisations was to support a shift in \nemphasis from the treatment of disease and disability: to improve the health of the public \nand its access to more responsive health services (Department of Health,1997, 2000). In \nturn, this initiative implied extending the influence of a social model of health, founded \non a wider definition of what constitutes legitimate knowledge and, thereby, the role of \npublic involvement.  Our fieldwork suggested that Locality 1 focused its energies on \nimproving health services and worked with partner organisations to achieve this aim \n(Authors, 2002). Its conception of the public\u2019s role was one that emphasised dyadic \nactive\/passive relationships consistent with the traditional patient\/professional \nrelationship. In Locality 2, the emphasis was on health as affected by social and \nenvironmental conditions, and the public\u2019s contribution in actively creating its own health \nthrough its voice in decision-making.  This approach was positively reflected in the \nBoard\u2019s preference for utilising pre-existing inter-organisational networks as vehicles for \npublic involvement:  \n \n 23\n\u2026...part of the joint finance set-up organised by the local authority is the local working \ngroups with a multi-agency representation, including the police, education, social \nservices, health and so on and they are tailor-made for what the Primary Care Group is \ntrying to do which is build the bridges between all these agencies. \n \n \n \nThe significance of these networks signals their support for a social model of health, \nconstituting a recognition that medical knowledge is but one necessary source of \ninformation: \n\u2026I think the Health Service as a whole, the whole culture of it, is moving away from the \nmedical model to the social model and that\u2019s where you start to bring in the public views.  \n(2:6) \nMoreover, the need to challenge the medical model was considered part of the \ncommunity development role: \nI don\u2019t know how you felt about (that board meeting).. but I felt it was very medical \nmodel-based and a part of a community health worker\u2019s role is to try and disrupt that to \nsome extent and get the social model being considered \u2026and to keep talking about public \ninvolvement\u2026.   \n In locality 2, therefore, inter-organisational networks combined with associated \nstructures for community involvement to encourage a different logic for communication \nwith the public, which was supportive of a social\/environmental model of health.  By \ncontrast, the more restricted approach to public involvement in locality 1, together with \n 24\nthe continuing authority accorded to professional knowledge, also restricted the focus of \ninvolvement to feedback on, and the improvement of, existing services. \n \nIt was recognised in locality 2 that, in addition to challenging professional influence,  \npluralistic approaches to decision making had major implications for management: \n The NHS has perhaps had a very autocratic management style with rigid hierarchies \nand, you know, somebody at the top takes the decision, it rattles through and that\u2019s what \nthe patient gets at the end of the day and we are trying to move a bit more towards the \nother extreme of participative management where you are almost managing by \npersuasion rather than by dictat and that requires quite different managers, really, and \nmanagement styles \u2026it takes a lot of.. confidence to let go to some degree those decisions \nyou would have held close to your chest and could have taken comfortably in the \nknowledge that nobody else was really aware that you were taking them. \nIt follows, therefore, that \u2018active management\u2019 needs to give ground to \u2018active \ncitizenship\u2019 is public involvement is to be more than another tool for organisational \neffectiveness.  \nConclusion \nWe began this account by noting that public involvement had been accorded renewed \nlegitimacy in the NHS as part of a wider programme of modernisation designed to secure \nmore responsive and effective relationships between the service and the public. PCGs and \nPCTs were established by the New Labour government to \u2018reconnect\u2019 the NHS with local \npublics and deliver different outcomes through greater pluralism in decision-making. We \nalso recognised that public involvement had a record of being more token than real. At \n 25\nthe same time, however, these developments in the NHS were taking place in the context \nof a wider shift from government to governance in which hierarchical influences were \napparently being diluted in more pluralistic local networks potentially providing greater \nopportunities for public involvement in decision-making.  \n \nThe exploratory research we undertook was designed to examine how PCG\/T boards \nunderstood and implemented their responsibilities for public engagement in this new \nenvironment. The two localities in which we conducted fieldwork were purposively \nselected to provide similarities in organisational and other contexts for the \nimplementation of a common policy initiative. We have identified a mixed pattern of \nsimilarity and difference in the emerging outcomes from the policy space shared by the \nboards.  \nOne was a form of governance which took account of networks at the organizational level \nbut retained traditional hierarchical relationships with the public. In doing so, it limited \npossibilities for the emergence of issues the board had not already placed on the agenda. \nMoreover, its focus on establishing public \u2018opinion\u2019 was in keeping with a consumer-\noriented view of the public\u2019s role. In the second locality, network structures cut across \nthat hierarchical relationship and encouraged involvement based on dialogue, the \nconsequence of which was fundamental to both the content and the form of engagement. \nIt also approximated more closely to a public role based on a collective conception of \ncitizenship.  The appearance of divergent trajectories within the same (or very similar) \npolicy space requires us to explain the patterning of the processes and outcomes we \nidentified.  In particular, we need to consider the relevance of Jessop\u2019s emphasis on \n 26\nheterarchy. This framework is especially important in shifting the focus of analysis \nbeyond the inter-organisational and interpersonal dimensions of explanation. Professional \nviews and expectations, organizational structures, and the methods adopted to promote \ninvolvement, are nested within more fundamental values located at the inter-systemic \nlevel.  In focusing on that level, we have drawn attention to notions of individual \nresponsibility and enforced altruism as values that are embedded but conflicting within \nthe system. The latter was found to be dominant in that both boards gave primacy to their \nown \u2018expert\u2019 knowledge. The value of scientific rationalism, which underpins enforced \naltruism, not only supported the higher value accorded to medical and managerial \nknowledge, it also validated \u2018scientific\u2019 approaches to public involvement thereby \nprioritising representativeness over dialogical knowledge. In the secondary role accorded \nto public voice, two conflicting sources of authority were evident: a consumer orientation \nthat corresponded with \u2018individual responsibility\u2019 and a citizenship status based on \ncollective agency as a further ground of legitimacy.   \nOur empirical evidence suggests the potential for involvement emerges from the \ninteraction between levels of the heterarchy, providing different kinds of space. In \nlocality 1 success was defined largely by decision making through expert knowledge, \nsupported by public opinion. In locality 2 the social world of the public, its priorities and \nvalues assumed greater significance, with the potential to challenge the historic \nascendancy of professional and management influences.   Thus, the extent of policy space \nand scope for variations in policy outcomes was not pre-determined by the policy itself, \nbut was contingent on the particular interaction of factors within the two localities. In this \nrespect, our findings are consistent with the concept of \u2018path dependence\u2019 and the \n 27\nsignificance of history in creating divergent configurations (Gains, John and Stoker, \n2005).   \n From this perspective, the nature of the space opened up for public involvement does not \ncome from the action of citizens forcing change. Rather, it arises from a combination of: \nthe forms of legitimacy accorded to the voice of the public at the inter-systemic level; \nrelationships that emerge from the interaction of that level with the pursuit of \norganisational efficiency at inter-organizational level; and the operation of both sets of \ninfluences at inter-personal level in relations between local actors. Where this is defined \nfirmly in an active\/passive dyad, the scope for the public\u2019s voice is limited by the board\u2019s \ndefinition of the relevant questions and issues for participation. By contrast, where a \ndialogical approach is adopted in the context of a network of stakeholders, the space for \nplurality of contributions to governance offers potential for the public to have a more \nfundamental agenda shaping role. The difference between approaches, therefore, is to be \nexplained less in terms of respective enthusiasms to consult the public than about how the \nunderlying legitimacy of public involvement, efficiency seeking, and conceptions of what \nconstitutes consultation, penetrate the policy space. \n \nThe legitimacy accorded to the public voice is directly related to how the role of the \npublic is embedded within the system.  The multiple conceptions of the public role, \nwhich manifest themselves in confusions of status at the locality level, originate in the \nspace created by the inter-systemic bases of legitimacy combined with inter-\norganisational considerations of efficiency. The contribution of the public voice, in turn, \n 28\nis not only to provide information to inform the design and delivery of services, but to \nreinforce, or challenge, the particular manifestation of those system factors. \n \n This article has sought to go beyond the identification of indeterminacy created by the \npolicy space which now constitutes local governance, to consider how we might \nunderstand emergent variations. We have acknowledged the importance of the move \nfrom hierarchies to networks, as well as of the persistence of both. In this context we \nhave suggested that the role of public participation has been treated simply as one of a \nplurality of power bases jostling for position. We have suggested that such an \nunderstanding must presuppose the public as \u2018active citizen\u2019 and that this is far from \nreflecting the reality of the public role. In order to understand the role the public might \nplay, we have employed Jessop\u2019s conception of heterarchy as a framework expressing the \nlevels at which both structure and agency operate within the system. Policy space then \nbecomes much more than a set of organisational structures and is shaped through an \ninteraction between structure and agency at all levels of the heterarchy. To understand \nthat interaction, however, we must also understand the embedding of values within the \nsystem and their impact on its reproduction. \n \nReferences \n6, P. and Peck, E.
