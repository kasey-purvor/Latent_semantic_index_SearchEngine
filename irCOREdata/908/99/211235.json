The criminal justice system relies on legitimacy and consent to an extent \nunlike other public services; public support is vital if the police and other criminal justice \nagencies are to function both effectively and in accordance with democratic norms. Yet we \nknow little about the forms of social perception that stand prior to public confidence and \npolice legitimacy. Drawing on data from the 2003\/2004 British Crime Survey and the \n2006\/2007 London Metropolitan Police Safer Neighbourhoods Survey, this paper shows that \npeople think about their local police in ways less to do with the risk of victimisation \n(instrumental concerns about personal safety) and more to do with judgements about social \ncohesion and moral consensus (expressive concerns about neighbourhood stability, cohesion \nand loss of collective authority). Across England and Wales the police are not primarily seen \nas providers of a narrow sense of personal security, held responsible for crime and safety. \nInstead the police stand as symbolic \u2018guardians\u2019 of social stability and order, held responsible \nfor community values and informal social controls. We also show that public confidence in \nthe London Metropolitan Police Service expresses broader social anxieties about long-term \nsocial change. We finish our paper with some thoughts on a sociological analysis of public \nconfidence, police legitimacy and the cultural place of policing: confidence (and perhaps \nultimately the legitimacy of the police) might just be wrapped up in broader public concerns \nabout social order and moral consensus. \n \nKey words: Public confidence in policing; fear of crime; policing; legitimacy; disorder; \nsocial cohesion; community efficacy \n 3 \n\u2018The paradox is that not all that is policing lies in the police, to paraphrase \nDurkheim on the contract. The police will appear more successful the less they \nare actually necessary. The sources of order lie outside the ambit of the police, in \nthe political economy and culture of a society \u2026 Subtle, informal social controls, \nand policing processes embedded in other institutions, regulate most potential \ndeviance. When these informal control processes are successful, the police will \nappear highly effective in crime prevention, and deal effectively and legitimately \nwith the crime and disorder that do occur.\u2019 (Reiner 2000: xi). \n \n1. Introduction \nPolicing and the cultural significance of the police have long been subjects of sociological \nenquiry (Banton 1964; Skolnick 1966; Bittner 1970; Cain 1973; Ericson & Haggerty 1997; \nLoader 1997; Manning 1997; Waddington 1999; Reiner 2000; Walker 2000; Freiberg 2001; \nLoader & Mulcahy 2003; Innes 2004a; Goldsmith 2005). While self-regulation is the most \nefficient route to cooperation and rule-observance (Tyler, 1990), formal agents of social \ncontrol provide for the public compliance of rules necessary for the functioning of a society: \nwe need laws to govern human behaviour; and we need state force to ensure compliance with \nthose laws (Hough 2003, 2004a).  \nSocieties depend on courts to administer justice, prisons to administer punishment, and \npolice forces to catch criminals and deter crime. And just as social regulation is best achieved \nby tapping into individuals\u2019 internal motivations to obey the law, the criminal justice system \nrelies on motivations toward cooperation and support (Hough 2007). At the heart of these is \nthe public belief that agents of criminal justice act appropriately, properly and justly (Tyler \n2006). According to Reiner (2006: 4) such legitimacy is: \u2018\u2026fraught and constantly subject to \nnegotiation and definition, given the intimate relationship between policing, conflict and, \nultimately, violence.\u2019 Legitimacy then leads individuals to engage in law-abiding behaviour, \ncooperate with policing efforts, and show deference to police tactics (Tyler and Huo 2002; \nSunshine & Tyler 2003a, 2003b; Reisig et al. 2007). Such a model of social regulation is of \nvalue because it is safer and more efficient than a deterrence model based on the use of force: \nreliance on citizens\u2019 internal motives for self-control reduces the cost, danger, and alienation \nassociated with displays of force to affect citizen compliance with law.  \nThe symbolism and cultural significance of policing has been the subject of sustained \nscholarly attention. The police protect us from crime but they also intrude into our lives. We \nwant the police to target others \u2013 those we hold responsible for crime and disorder \u2013 and we \nclamour for more visible deterrent patrolling and a style of policing more responsive to local \nneeds (Fitzgerald et al. 2002). But we resent it when the police turn their attention on us; we \nare especially sensitive to the fairness in which the police exercise their authority. More \nbroadly, as a cultural symbol \u2018policing\u2019 may also condense public sensibilities towards social \norder, change and authority (Loader & Mulcahy 2003; Freiberg 2001; Manning 1997): \nperhaps we look to the police to defend community values and moral structures, especially \nwhen those values and structures are felt to be under threat (Jackson & Sunshine 2007)? \nSuch a set of varied needs and desires reminds us that the police institution is \nentangled with questions of hierarchy, deference, commitment to society, moral consensus, \nand the urge for security. British-based sociologists and criminologists have written \npersuasively about the social and cultural significance of the police (see in particular Reiner \n2000 and Loader & Mulcahy 2003). But actual empirical analyses have thus far been rare. \n 4 \nThis paper takes one step toward redressing this imbalance. It focuses not on issues of \nprocedural justice (Tyler & Huo 2002; Sunshine & Tyler 2003a; Tyler 2006; Reisig et al. \n2007), nor on public encounters with the police (Skogan 2006; Bradford et al. in press), but \non the social and cultural significance of public confidence in policing.  \n \n2. Goals of the paper \nDrawing on data from the 2003\/2004 British Crime Survey (BCS) and the 2006\/2007 \nMetropolitan Police Safer Neighbourhoods Survey (SNS), two models of public confidence in \npolicing are assessed. The first views the police as guarantors (to the public) of security and \nsafety. According to this perspective those individuals who are especially concerned about \ndisorder and crime \u2013 and who are especially concerned about falling victim \u2013 are unlikely to \nexpress confidence in the police (to maintain order, fight crime, treat citizens fairly, and to be \nresponsible and accountable for community needs and priorities). Skogan (2008) would call \nthis an \u2018accountability model\u2019 where the public hold the police responsible for neighbourhood \nconditions that include fear, perceived risk of victimisation and crime.i In the UK a slightly \nmore restrictive model \u2013 namely that fear of crime and public perceptions of the risk of crime \nare key factors driving public confidence in police effectiveness \u2013 has been successfully tested \nusing data from a rural English population (Jackson & Sunshine 2007). \n Yet Jackson and Sunshine found that public confidence in policing was decided not by \nperceptions of risk, nor by fear of crime. Instead a different model of public confidence was \nmore consistent with the data. Attitudes towards the effectiveness of the police were rooted in \nlay evaluations of social order, cohesion, trust, and moral consensus: people looked to the \npolice to defend social values and behavioural norms. Moreover, the public seemed to want \nthe police to be strong representatives of their community, as demonstrated in part by officers \ntreating the public fairly and with dignity. This more \u2018expressive\u2019 and neo-Durkheimian \nmodel stands in contrast to the \u2018instrumental\u2019 model. It holds that confidence in policing is \nrooted not in fear of crime nor in perceptions of risk, but in more symbolic yet \u2018day-to-day\u2019 \nconcerns about neighbourhood cohesion and collective efficacy. \nThis paper extends and develops the empirical work of Jackson & Sunshine (2007) by \ndrawing on recent theoretical advances in the cultural sociology of policing (chiefly Girling et \nal. 2000; Reiner 2000; Freiberg 2001; Loader & Mulcahy 2003). The question is not just \nwhether the findings generalise to a fresh and stronger dataset, but also whether the analysis \ncan be broadened to include anxieties over social change and the loss of moral authority and \ndiscipline. Findings confirm that attitudes toward crime and policing are shaped more by lay \nassessments of (non-criminal) symbols of social order and control than by instrumental \nconcerns about safety and crime. Legitimacy \u2013 as expressed through confidence in the police \n\u2013 seems thus rooted in public diagnoses of (non-criminal) social stability and demands on the \npolice to defend the moral order. Reiner (2000) suggested that the police are faced with the \nparadox that they appear more successful the less they are necessary. This paper concludes \nthat not only are the police judged by the lack of need for them, but also by public diagnoses \nof local values and moral structures that shape perceptions of crime. Informal social controls \nregulate most deviance, and when these informal social controls are successful, the police \nmay appear successful; when the informal social controls are seen to be weak \u2013 and when \npeople are concerned about the long-term erosion of neighbourhood cohesion and social \ncapital \u2013 the police may already have lost the confidence of the communities they serve.  \n \n 5 \n3. The social and cultural significance of public confidence in policing \nIf experiences of and orientations toward the police are implicated in broader structures of \nfeeling and affect toward law, order, authority and cohesion, how might these rather abstract \nconcepts manifest in people\u2019s everyday experience and practical consciousness? Perhaps the \nanswer to this question lies at the confluence of ideas and emotions around nation, state, \ncohesion and belonging. Loader (1997) outlines a process through which the police have \ncome to act as a \u2018condensation symbol\u2019 (c.f. Turner 1974) for an array of sensibilities and \noutlooks which coalesce around a particular version of English national identity. Using \nBourdieu\u2019s notion of symbolic power, Loader (1997: 4) discusses the ways in which \nexperience of the police connects with pre-existing \u2018dispositions towards, and fantasies of, \npolicing\u2019. These in turn are largely drawn from a repertoire recalling a golden age of \ncohesiveness, stability and national efficacy \u2013 the immediate post-war years \u2013 which has \nsubsequently been degraded by the changes arising from modernity, globalization, and mass \nimmigration. Loader and Mulcany (2003: 315) also underline the salience for a certain section \nof the English public of a \u2018police force of the imagination\u2019, against which the present \ninstitution can only ever compare badly. In this body of work the image of Dixon of Dock \nGreen as the quintessential English policeman is important less for any apogee of police \nlegitimacy he may represent (Reiner 2000) than for the fact that he conjures up the time \nbefore the fall when the (explicitly English) nation was cohesive, strong and at peace with \nitself. \nThat Dixon represents a pre-lapsarian past which contrasts starkly with the modern \nday is in no small measure due to changes within the police force itself. As Reiner (1992) has \ndocumented, there has been a \u2018long erosion\u2019 of the image of the traditional British Bobby \u2013 \nfrom Dixon to masked SWAT-style marksman. However, it seems likely that both images \ncoexist in the public mind and are called upon at different conjunctures in the construction of \n\u2018the police\u2019 not only as a sociological institution but also as a group of people encountered \u2018on \nthe streets\u2019. The imaginary of the police is therefore multi-faceted, contradictory, and open to \nmany different interpretations. The police are at once a threat and a promise, wielding \nlegitimate force to maintain order, embodying and representing the state to its citizens in all \nits negative as well as positive aspects.  \nAccording to much theoretical work in the sociological and criminological literature, \nthe police thus seem to convey images of order, justice and stability (or their absence) whilst \nalso being expressive of the \u2018spirit\u2019 of the nation-state (Loader and Mulcahy 2003; Reiner \n2000; Taylor 1999; Waddington 1999). More prosaically the police present a highly visible \ninstantiation of state power, with which it is nonetheless possible to interact on a face-to-face \nbasis \u2013 a position which contrasts with that of many other representations of the state. This \nmulti-layered cultural significance implies the police may embody both \u2018the\u2019 national \nconsciousness and, in a very immediate way, the state which assumes control over, and \nresponsibility for, the nation: the  police are deeply implicated in production of the legitimate \npolitical order which reproduces recognition of the state\u2019s right to assume this control \n(Habermas 1979). \nDrawing on both Weber and Gramsci, Taylor (1999: 21-22) argues that the state\u2019s \nstruggle for legitimacy operates on different levels and in different ways: through ceremonies \nof national unification; through the provision of economic or material support for the \npopulation; and through a constant process of readjustment by national leaderships in the face \nof different political, economic and social demands from subordinate populations at specific \n 6 \nhistorical junctures. The uniformed police, as \u2018symbolic guardians\u2019 of social order and justice, \nare involved at all three levels. Most importantly the third suggests a police role, whether \nceremonial\/ideological or practical, which is not static but involved in processes of \nreinterpretation and dispute resulting from competing demands on the state and the specific \ncircumstances which arise as it attempts to reaffirm its legitimacy. This argument places the \npolice at the centre of a web of relationships, which, while of course implicating the \nmaintenance of practical security, place heavy emphasis on the production, negotiation and \nreproduction of symbolic and social order. \nAnd just as the police lie at the heart of state legitimation processes, policing may also \nbe an active centre of the social order in a broader, Geertzian, sense. The police may act to \nproduce and communicate contested meanings: order\/disorder, justice\/injustice, \nnormality\/deviance (Loader 2006). Policing mediates collective identity, and as an institution \nrelays messages of recognition and belonging or, conversely, misrecognition and exclusion \n(Waddington 1999). The police are not only representatives of the nation\/state and servants of \nthe people who comprise it, they are also in some ways constructive of the diverse social \ngroups through which the modern polity is constituted (Ericson and Haggerty 1997; Herbert \n2006). Policing and understandings of policing are suffused with messages about the \ncondition of society, the position of people within it, and the relation between state and \nindividual: \n \n\u2018Every stop, every search, every arrest, every group of youths moved on, every abuse of \ndue process, every failure to respond to call or complaint, every racist \u2026 sexist \u2026 \nhomophobic (comment), every diagnosis of the crime problem, every depiction of \ncriminals \u2013 all these send small, routine, authoritative signals about societies conflicts, \ncleavages and hierarchies about whose claims are considered legitimate within it, about \nwhose status identity is to be affirmed or denied as part of it\u2019 (Loader 2006: 211) \n \nDiscussing views of the police among \u2018well-off\u2019, largely middle-aged residents of an \nEnglish town, Girling et al. (2000) demonstrate the complexity of the relationship between \npolice and community within a rubric of the ongoing imagination and reproduction of nation \nand state. Concluding their qualitative work, the authors suggest that the figure of the police \nofficer is a symbol through which, simultaneously, a settled, cohesive national past can be \nrecalled and a troubled, fractured present can be explicated. The image of the police speaks \npowerfully to concerns about social order, social problems, and the way in which \u2018things \naren\u2019t what they used to be\u2019. Such concerns are intimately bound up with concrete policing \npractise and policies. For example a perceived lack of street patrols is experienced as the loss \nof an \u2018identifiable authority figure, known by, and belonging to, the community\u2019 (Girling et \nal. 2000: 123) and reflect anxieties about changes in the social and moral order of the town:  \n \n\u2018Here the subsequent \u201cwithdrawal\u201d of the police is understood as a coming apart of the \n\u201cglue\u201d that once held a neighbourhood together and guaranteed its now fondly \nremembered quality of life.\u2019 (Girling et al. 2000:  124).  \n \nAs descriptions of the majority or dominant set of orientations toward the police, the \nideas outlined above appear convincing. But it is important to recognise that they will not \nhold for all people or for all social groups. In particular, opinions are likely to be very \n 7 \ndifferent among those who have long histories of difficult relations with the police or (more \nlikely, and) who are excluded from the dominant social order the police represent. The two \nmost important groups here are of course young people (Loader 1996; McAra and McVie \n2005) and those from ethnic minority groups (Bowling and Philips 2002). Just as the police \nrepresent for many order, stability and cohesion, to people from these social groups they may \nrepresent the unfair priorities of the dominant social order, an interfering state, or even \noppression. As Loader (2006) notes, calls for policing responses to problems of low level \ndisorder are often also calls for attention to be directed at subaltern groups, leading to \npotentially divergent patterns of association between the maintenance of social order, policing \nand confidence. Prevalent structures of feeling among marginalised or excluded groups may \ntherefore differ significantly from the dominant tropes outlined above, although it would be a \nmistake to assume that confidence per se will automatically be lower (see below), or that \nthose from subordinate groups desire very different forms of policing (c.f. Carr et al. 2007). \n \n4. Instrumental and expressive models of public confidence in policing \nSuch sensibilities \u2013 wherein the police represent and condense notions of social cohesion, \norder and the strength of formal and informal social controls, whether these be at the local \nlevel or at that of the imagined national community (Anderson 1983) \u2013 may also underpin \npublic confidence in the police. The idea motivating the current empirical investigation is as \nfollows. When people think about the police and their \u2018crime-fighting\u2019 activities, they also \nthink about what \u2018crime\u2019 stands for (erosion of norms and social ties that underpin group life) \nand what \u2018policing\u2019 stands for (organized defense of the norms and social ties). Individuals \nwho are concerned about long-term social change, who see the modern world as too \nindividualized and too atomized, then look to the police to defend a sense of order, precisely \nat the time when the police are themselves moving in many ways toward becoming a modern, \nefficient, public service shorn of such \u2018old-fashioned\u2019 symbolic elements (Hough 2003, \n2004a, 2007). \nNotwithstanding such \u2018modernization,\u2019 other current trends in policing correspond \nquite closely to such a symbolic or relational perspective on public confidence in policing. \nThe National Reassurance Policing Programme (NRPP) and Neighbourhood Policing, for \nexample, explicitly aim not only reduce fear of crime and improve feelings of safety, but also \nto reduce anti-social behaviour, improve quality of life, and increase public confidence \n(Tuffin et al. 2006). These and other policies draw on the signal crimes approach (Innes \n2004a, 2004b) and other academic work which has suggested that it is what people feel about \nthe police within a broad social context which is most important in influencing trust and \nsupport. \nThe contention of this \u2018expressive\u2019 model of public confidence is therefore that \njudgements about public effectiveness \u2013 like fear of crime \u2013 are driven not be a misplaced and \nabstract sense of \u2018crime out of control\u2019, but rather by lay assessments of cohesion, social \ncontrol and civility that reflect concerns about the breakdown and fragmentation of society \n(for speculation about this, see inter alia: Biderman et al. 1967; Garofalo & Laub 1978; \nMerry, 1981; Scheingold 1984; Sparks, 1992; Bursik and Gramsick 1993; Dowds and \nAhrendt 1995; Hale 1996; Girling et al. 1998; Taylor & Jamieson 1998; Girling et al. 2000; \nFreiberg 2001; Jackson 2004). As Girling et al. (2000: 45) argue, anxiety about crime \nexpresses people\u2019s sense of the place they inhabit and of: \n \n 8 \n \u2018\u2026their place within a world of hierarchies, troubles, opportunities and insecurities ...  \n[the] wider domain of moral judgements, attachments and arguments about blaming, \nexplaining and diagnosing diverse questions of order and insecurity as these arose for \nthem in the particular settings of their daily life.\u2019 \n \nAccording to such a perspective, confidence in the effectiveness of local policing is \nshaped by public perceptions of social order and cohesion. It follows that both fear of crime \nand confidence express the same judgements of community conditions. The neo-Durkheimian \nmodel developed by Jackson & Sunshine (2007) takes this as its starting point (cf. Freiberg, \n2001), proposing that a sense of order and cohesiveness \u2013 the day-to-day things that define a \nhealthy social environment and constitute conditions conducive to crime \u2013 is key. People look \nto the police to be guardians of social order \u2013 as prototypical representatives of the \ncommunity (Sunshine & Tyler 2003b) \u2013 and when norms and values are seen to be in decline, \nthey turn to the police to defend the moral structure and reassert a sense of social control. In \nthis way, the police are both a symbolic and a practical means of reconstituting a shaky social \norder.ii Jackson (2004) found that these attitudes and anxieties shaped how people made sense \nof the stability of their neighbourhood, and thus indirectly shaped consequent worries about \ncrime. Might the same hold true for public confidence in policing? \nIn contrast, the instrumental model states that fear of crime erodes faith in the criminal \njustice system; anxiety about victimization erodes confidence and support for the police, and \nleads people to take punitive stances on issues of sentencing and criminal justice (Tyler & \nBoeckmann, 1997; Boeckmann & Tyler, 1997). The public look to the police to perform an \ninstrumental role: to make people feel safe. If this model holds to improve public support the \npolice should attempt to dampen down excessive fear and correct inaccurate beliefs about \ncrime, perhaps by educating the public or by publicizing police successes. \n \n5. Study one \n \nMethod \nConcerned primarily with establishing rates of victimisation in the general population, the \nBritish Crime Survey (BCS) also addresses a range of crime-related topics, including fear of \ncrime, public confidence in policing, and exposure to illegal drugs. The 2003\/2004 sweep had \na core sample of 37,000 and a boost of 3,000 individuals from non-white groups. The analysis \npresented here draws upon data from a sub-sample (specifically, sub-sample D2 which \ncontains data from one-eighth of all respondents) since only this sub-sample were fielded all \nthe questions needed for the analysis. Also contained in the 2003\/04 BCS dataset are variables \nderived from the 2004 Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD).iii  \nThe analysis proceeds in four steps.iv The first is the statistical assessment of the \npartial association between fear and confidence, controlling for a range of factors but with a \nparticular interest in levels of crime in respondents\u2019 neighbourhoods. It could be that fear of \ncrime acts as a proxy for more objective conditions. So, fear of crime might be a statistically \nsignificant predictor of confidence not because it is causally related, but rather because crime \nis the real causal factor, and crime is related to both fear and confidence. But if fear of crime \nis associated with confidence net of levels of crime then it really is about perception: in high-\ncrime areas, people who report no fear will typically feel that their local police force is doing \na good job (despite the incidence of crime); in low-crime areas, people who feel anxious \n 9 \nabout crime will typically have little confidence in the police (despite the incidence of crime).  \nThe second step is to introduce into the model people\u2019s perceptions of disorder, \ncohesion and informal social control in their neighbourhood. If these perceptual variables are \nmore important than worry about crime then we have some evidence for the neo-Durkhiemian \nmodel. Namely, that more day-to-day issues of neighbourhood stability and breakdown come \nto the fore when people evaluate police performance. The third step of analysis is to assess the \nextent to which fear of crime and social perception play roles in shaping public confidence in \npolicing across localities of differing crime rates. For example, it may be that fear of crime \nhas a greater impact in areas of high crime; perception of social cohesion and collective \nefficacy may have a greater impact in areas of low crime. It could be a \u2018luxury\u2019 to think of the \npolice as old-fashioned defenders of norms, values and a sense of community cohesion: with \ngreater problems of crime, people may desire a more instrumental sense of reassurance. \nAccordingly, this study estimates interaction effects between, separately, fear of crime and \ncrime, and social perception and crime.  \nThe fourth step integrates the preceding analysis, using structural equation modelling \nto test a full meditational model that makes several predictions. First, levels of crime predict \nperceptions of the environment (disorder and social cohesion). Second, perceptions of the \nenvironment shape assessments of the likelihood of victimisation. Third, both perceptions of \nthe environment and assessments of likelihood influence both worry about crime. Finally, \nperceptions of the environment are hypothesised to predict public confidence in policing.  \n \nResults \nDefining and measuring concepts \nPublic confidence in policing is measured using a \u2018global\u2019 measure, where respondents are \nasked whether they thought that their local police force were doing an excellent, good, fair, \npoor or very poor job. The 2003\/2004 BCS did not field questions that covered specific \ndimensions of effectiveness, fairness and community engagement (see Bradford et al. in \npress), unfortunately. However the global measure is assumed to tap into an amalgam of \neffectiveness, fairness and community engagement (for evidence on this see Bradford & \nJackson 2008). \nSeparate indices are constructed from multiple indicators of (a) worry about crimev, \n(b) perception of incivilities, (c) perception of social cohesion, (d) perception of informal \nsocial control (collective efficacy, see Sampson et al. 1997; Sampson & Raudenbush 1999), \nand (e) interviewer assessment of disorder. Using ordinal latent trait modelling with full \ninformation maximum likelihood estimation (using Latent Gold 4.0), factor scores are saved \nto create a single index for each construct. Ordinal latent trait analysis treats the indicators as \nordinal categorical variables (compared to treating them as continuous) \u2013 which of course \nthey are. Full information maximum likelihood estimation draws upon all possible \ninformation, meaning one does not drop missing values nor substitute them with the mean \n(for example). The Appendix Table shows the factor loadings, which are acceptable for the \npresent purposes.  \n \nControl variables \nThe control variables are gender, age, ethnicity, social class, household income, area-type \n(rural, urban and inner-city), and whether or not the respondent had been a victim of crime in \nthe previous 12 months. While the BCS gathers data on public contact with the police, most \n 10 \nof these data pertain to survey follow-up A. The analysis had to exclude either aspects of \nsocial perception (included in follow-up D) or police contact. Because the focus of the study \nis on social perception, the impact of public encounters with the police on public confidence \nin policing is not assessed (for this see Skogan 2006; Bradford et al. in press). \n \nModelling public confidence in policing \nThe first step is to examine the association between worry about crime and public confidence \nin policing, controlling for the variables listed above. Because the response variable is ordinal \n(five categories) ordinal regression is used since it allows one to specify a categorical variable \nas the response but unlike multinomial logistic regression takes into account the ordered \nnature of the measure. SPSS (version 15) employs a proportional odds model. Therefore, if \nthe explanatory variable increases by one unit while all other explanatory remain unchanged, \nthe odds are multiplied by exp(B) for every category of the response variable.  \nTable I (Model I) shows that victimization experience is associated with low levels of \nconfidence. Males are more likely to judge their local police to do a poor job than females, as \nare older people; Blacks and Asians are more likely to judge their local police positively than \nWhites, corresponding to results from more recent waves of the BCS which have reported \nconfidence to be higher in Black and Asian ethnic groups than among Whites (for example \nsee Jansson et al. 2007: 9). Social class, household income and area type (rural versus inner-\ncity and urban versus inner-city) are not statistically significant predictors. Model I also \nshows a statistically significant association between worry about crime and dissatisfaction \nwith the local police (exp(B) 1.375; p<.001): thus, for every one unit increase in level of \nworry we expect the odds of moving from one category to the next to increase by 37.5%. In \nother words the greater the intensity of worry about crime, the worse the rating of local police \nperformance.  \n \nINSERT TABLE I ABOUT HERE \n \nHowever once one controls for lay perceptions of disorder, social cohesion and \ninformal social control, the impact of worry about crime on public confidence in local \npolicing decreases somewhat (Model II, Table I). Instead public perception of incivility and \ninformal social control is more important. Therefore \u2013 and as found by Jackson & Sunshine \n(2007) \u2013 it is perception of cohesion more than worry about crime that seems to drive public \nconfidence in policing. However contrary to Jackson & Sunshine (2007) disorder and fear of \ncrime are each statistically significant predictors of public satisfaction with the police. \n It is striking how little effect area-level measures of crime and quality of the living \nenvironment has on public confidence in policing (in sharp contrast to the findings of \nSampson & Bartusch\u2019s 1998 Chicago study). In Model II, neither crime levels, quality of the \nenvironment, nor interviewer assessment of disorder predicts public confidence in policing. \nClearly fear of crime, perceptions of disorder and informal social control are far more \nimportant to public confidence in policing than objective measures of crime and disorder.  \nThe next step is to assess whether the level of crime in an area alters the relative \nimportance of worry about crime, public perceptions of disorder and lay concerns about social \ncohesion. Fear might reasonably play a stronger role in public confidence in policing in an \narea of high crime than in an area of low crime. Strikingly however, when interaction effects \nbetween the IMD measure of crime and each of the four perceptual variables are entered into \n 11 \nthe regression model none are statistically significant (the parameter estimates are not \npresented here for reasons of brevity). These findings show that it does not matter whether \nrespondents lived in an area with high levels of crime or not \u2013 perceptions of disorder and \ncohesion still drive dissatisfaction with the local police with equal weight. \n \nModeling fear of crime and public confidence in policing in the BCS \nThe final step is to test an integrative model of fear of crime and public confidence in \npolicing. Figure I presents the results, produced using AMOS 7.0. The fit of the model is good \naccording to approximate fit indices (RMSEA=.041, CFI=.946), but not according to tests of \nexact fit (\u03c7 2 7859, 124 df, \u03c1<.001). As is customary however, the researcher places most \nimportance on the approximate fit indices since the Chi-Square statistic is extremely sensitive \nto sample size. The first thing to note from Figure I is that confidence in the local police is \nassociated more with public perception of disorder and informal social control than with \nworry about crime. Secondly, a good deal of the statistical effect of judgements of community \nconditions (disorder, cohesion and informal social control) on worry about crime is mediated \nby the assessment of victimisation risk. However, there is a strong direct association between \ndisorder and worry about crime, which suggests that fear of crime is correlated with both the \njudgement of victimisation risk and a more diffuse sense of disorder in the environment. \nMoreover, social cohesion has a small predictive role with fear of crime, so feeling that one \nhas a supportive community around one may be associated with lower anxieties about one\u2019s \npersonal safety. Finally, the statistical effect of living in a high-crime area on perceived risk, \nworry about crime, and confidence in policing is almost entirely mediated through perception \nof disorder, cohesion and informal social control. An effect decomposition shows total \nstandardised effects of crime levels on (a) worry about crime of .179 and (b) confidence in \npolicing of .087, with nearly all of these being indirect effects.  \n \nINSERT FIGURE I ABOUT HERE \n \n6. Study two \nStudy one showed that while neighbourhood crime levels and worry about crime have small \nimpacts on confidence in the local police, far more important were perceptions of social \ncohesion, informal social control and especially levels of perceived disorder (net of actual \nlevels of crime and interviewer assessments of respondent\u2019s local area). The latter two set of \nconcerns had large, significant effects on confidence. Ideas about disorder and social cohesion \nalso had indirect effects, with their impact on public confidence in policing mediated by fear \nof crime.  \nHowever some of the tools available in the BCS for this analysis were relatively \nbroad-brush. First, the measure of confidence in the police in study one was a single global \nindicator. Such overall ratings (\u2018How good or bad a job are the local police doing?\u2019) are likely \nto encompass ideas about police effectiveness, fairness and engagement with the community. \nBut it is useful to tease these apart. Study two focuses on just one of these elements, public \nconfidence in the effectiveness of the police. Second, conceptualisations about the position of \nthe police within structures of feeling which encompass both nation, state and belonging and \nideas about crime, law and disorder are only partly represented in data representing \nperceptions of cohesion, social control, crime and disorder alone; concerns about broader \nsocial change and attitudes toward law and order are potentially just as important. In short, the \n 12 \npolice may be judged to be ineffective not when they \u2018fail\u2019 to control crime, but when the \ncommunity and wider society is experienced as breaking down and when law and order is not \nrespected. \n \nMethod \nThe Metropolitan Police\u2019s Safer Neighbourhoods Survey (SNS) provides an opportunity (a) to \ntake local area effects better into account, (b) to more precisely measure confidence in police \neffectiveness, and (c) to broaden out the analysis to include concerns about law, order and \nwider social change. Conducted during April, May and June 2006 through a programme of \nface-to face interviews in the homes of respondents, the Safer Neighbourhoods Survey \nobtained responses from a sample of 2,844 residents in 7 wards across London, or in around \n400 in each. These 7 areas were chosen to represent a diverse cross-section in socio-\ndemographic terms (according to ACORN and Indices of Multiple Deprivation data) and to be \nspread throughout London. Selection of respondents was carried out using random probability \nsampling techniques in each of the 7 wards sampled.vi  \nSEM is again used in the analysis. A model is developed which combines similar \nvariables to those used in study one with measures representing wider attitudes to law, order \nand long-term social change. It also proposes a similar set of relationships. Both wider \nattitudes and \u2018objective\u2019 local conditions are expected to affect ideas about neighbourhood \ndisorder and social control: concerns about social change and law\/order are assumed to be \ndeeply held \u2013 constitutive of other ideas and feelings \u2013 and therefore formative of perceptions \nof local disorder and levels of informal social control. Net of the condition of their local area, \npeople who perceive a breakdown in society generally are likely to perceive a greater level of \ndisorder in their neighbourhood. Secondly, concerns about local disorder and informal control \nare expected to in turn influence worry about crime. Thirdly, wider social concerns, \nneighbourhood concerns and worry about crime are all expected to affect public confidence in \nthe effectiveness of the police. \n \nResults \nResults from the SEM model (using AMOS 7.0) are shown in Figure II. The model is \nspecified in such a way as to replicate the analysis used in study one as closely as possible. \nThe latent variables in the model mirror the ordinal latent trait constructs shown in study one, \nand the indicators (along with standardised regression coefficients for the measurement parts \nof the model) are shown in the Appendix Table. The \u2018objective\u2019 condition of the local area is \nrepresented in two ways: dummy variables for the survey wards; and a latent construct \nmeasuring interviewer\u2019s assessments the level of litter, vandalism and housing conditions of \nthe interviewees home and its immediate area (see Appendix Table). Note that for ease of \ninterpretation and presentation effects from the six dummy variables that represent the seven \nwards are omitted from Figure II. But in essence, the effect of ward of residence is held \nconstant when estimating all parts of the structural model. \nFigure II shows that the model fitted well according to the approximate fit measures \n(RMSEA=0.039; CFI=0.939). As envisaged, the condition of respondent\u2019s homes and \nimmediate locality (as measured by interviewers) predicts both perceptions of local disorder \nand informal social control and, through these, worry about crime and views about police \neffectiveness. There is also a significant direct path from interviewer assessments to police \neffectiveness. Net of respondent\u2019s ward and the \u2018real\u2019 level of neighbourhood disorder, \n 13 \nconcerns about long-term social change and attitudes toward law and order also predict \nperceptions of neighbourhood disorder and social control, and through these worry about \ncrime and ideas about police effectiveness. There is also a direct path from concerns about \nlong term social change to police effectiveness. Finally, and most importantly for the ideas \ndeveloped here, real and perceived neighbourhood disorder and concerns about informal \nsocial control are stronger predictors than public confidence in the effectiveness of the police \nthan does worry about crime. Furthermore, the size of the direct statistical effect of concerns \nabout long-term social change on ideas is at least as large, if not larger, than the direct \nstatistical effect of worry about crime; ideas about long term social change and law and order \nalso have mediated predictive paths to confidence in police effectiveness.vii \n \nINSERT FIGURE II NEAR HERE \n \nThe model shown in Figure II again offers strong support for the idea that in making \nassessments of their local police people draw on perceptions of local disorder and cohesion \nfar more than on the extent to which they worry about crime. While the police may be held to \naccount over crime and blamed if people feel more worried by it, ideas about police \neffectiveness are influenced far more by feelings about low-level social disorder, mechanisms \nof informal social control, and wider concerns. On an instrumental view, while the first of \nthese might be within the police\u2019s power to influence, such issues are generally far beyond the \nindependent influence of the police. But perhaps more importantly it is hard to imagine that \nthe link between (for example) concerns about decline in a shared sense of right and wrong \nand poor police performance is fully articulated, or even consciously expressed. It seems more \nlikely that the police are indeed acting as a condensation symbol, perhaps for both the \ncommunity (nation) within which such values are decaying and the state which does not step \nin to shore them up. \nFinally, Figure II suggests that concerns about long-term social change, perceptions of \nchanges in belonging, trust and shared values, have an impact on ideas about police \neffectiveness to a much greater extent than do attitudes toward law and order. The later \nrepresents opinions concerning other institutions \u2013 the family, the courts and schools (see \nAppendix Table) \u2013 while the former latent variables cover concerns about people living in the \nlocal area. The police may be blamed to an extent for perceived failings of other institutions, \nbut more pertinently there is a suggestion of a deep association between police and \ncommunity. Perhaps the police are indeed prototypical group representatives, an available, \nand obvious, receptacle for feelings of dislocation, decline, and the breakdown in trust and \nshared values. \n \n7. Discussion \nInvestigating the relationship between public confidence in the police and broader social \nconcerns about moral consensus and social cohesion, the two studies presented here support \nthe argument that confidence expresses concerns about neighbourhood stability and broader \nsocial anxieties. Across England and Wales public confidence in policing was associated with \nlay judgements of disorder and informal social control (or collective efficacy). Moreover once \nthese relationships were accounted for, fear of crime was only weakly correlated with \nsatisfaction with local policing. This pattern of relationships held no matter the actual level of \ncrime (according to police statistics summarised by the IMD at the level of Electoral Ward). \n 14 \nIn both high and low crime areas, therefore, disorder and informal social control were \nassociated with public confidence in police. Even controlling for interviewer assessments of \ndisorder had no impact on the role of interviewee perception: disorder really was in the \u2018eye \nof the beholder\u2019 (Merry 1981; Harcourt 2001; Sampson & Raudenbush 2004; Jackson 2004; \ncf. Gau & Pratt, 2008). In sum, the data suggest that individuals became dissatisfied with their \nlocal police force partly as a result of judging their streets and their community to lack order \nand informal social control \u2013 a lack of confidence was only weakly explained by public fears \nover crime. On an immediate level this is perhaps not surprising: low-level disorder and \nincivilities are likely to be much more common, and therefore more meaningful, in the lives \nof many people than the experience of serious or even more \u2018ordinary\u2019 criminality.viii  \nAlthough local-level data from London broadly confirmed these findings (study two) \nthis second set of data also went further. Worry about crime had only a moderately strong \ncorrelation with views about police effectiveness, while more important factors were views \nabout local disorder and informal social control. These in turn were affected not only by \nobjective local conditions but by ideas about wider changes in society and orientations toward \nlaw and order (see also Jackson 2004). There was also a direct link between the former and \nevaluations of police effectiveness. It is not just that disorder is more common in people\u2019s \nlives and therefore drives confidence in the police; such disorder is experienced and \ninterpreted in the light of broader orientations toward both law and order and wider social \nchange. However, it is likely that the current model should be seen, more broadly, to involve \nfeedback. Specifically, confidence in policing might inculcate a sense of \u2018ontological security\u2019 \n(Loader 2006) and encourage a more trusting and positive relationship to one\u2019s social and \nphysical environment, thus lowering perceptions of disorder\/cohesion, and in turn reducing \nfear of crime and increasing confidence over time. As with all studies based on cross-sectional \ndata, we have only one snapshot. But while there a clear issue of endogeneity in the present \ninvestigation, the order we presented in the model is most suitable to our comparison of the \ninstrumental and expressive models of public confidence in policing.  \nTherefore \u2013 and as found by Jackson & Sunshine (2007) \u2013 these two studies showed \nthat lay judgements of community conditions drove both fear of crime and public confidence \nin policing. The more people felt their environment to lack civility, trust and informal social \ncontrol, the more they felt at risk of crime, the more they worried, and (independently of fear) \nthe greater the dissatisfaction with policing. This finding strengthens existing evidence that \nfear of crime is less about some abstract sense of the crime problem and more an expression \nof day-to-day concerns about civility, trust and social stability (Bannister 1993; Girling et al. \n2000; Jackson 2006, 2008). It also appears that people think about the police less in terms of \n\u2018risk\u2019 and \u2018crime\u2019 (as Garland, 2001, put it) and more in terms of local disorder, civility and \nsocial order. Incivilities signal to observers that individuals and authorities have lost control \nover the community and are no longer in the position to preserve order. Disorder represents \ndisrespect to local norms; it communicates that commonly accepted standards concerning \npublic behaviour are being eroded. People look to the police to reassert social control and \nprotect a desired sense of ease, predictability and civility in their environment. They look to \nthe authority of the group \u2013 the formal agent of social control which represents both nation \nand state \u2013 to defend and restore the norms, values and social cohesion of the community seen \nto be under threat (Tyler & Boeckmann 1997; Sunshine & Tyler 2003a; Jackson & Sunshine \n2007).ix The reasons behind public anxieties about crime and the function and performance of \nthe police thus lie much deeper than \u2018mere\u2019 criminality: public confidence in policing might \n 15 \njust express a whole host of concerns about social cohesion and moral consensus (Jackson \n2004, 2006; Jackson & Sunshine 2007; see also Freiberg\u2019s (2001) discussion of the \u2018deeper \nemotional or affective dimensions of crime and its place in society.\u2019). \nOn this basis it seems that the public have a conception of security and concomitant \npolicing practices which is both wide and deep (Loader 2006; Loader & Walker 2007). As \nwell as problems related to crime, a whole range of social and economic issues have an \nimpact on fear of crime and confidence in the police. The natural response to this \u2013 indeed \none which the public appears to desire \u2013 is the provision of what Loader has called pervasive \npolicing. However, while there seems little doubt that the public wants the police to \u2018bring \nback\u2019 social control and a more stable, predictable environment \u2013 and while these issues are \nimportant in reducing fear of crime and victimization and increasing confidence in the police \n\u2013 there must be considerable uncertainty as to whether many of the things people want the \npolice to do are within its power to address. The resonance with Reiner\u2019s (2007) recent \nexploration of the political-economic roots of much crime and disorder is strong \u2013 the causes \nof the issues important to the public run much deeper than a police response in any normal \nsense can reach. \nThe \u2018broken windows\u2019 thesis (Wilson and Kelling 1982), and associated policing \npractices, would depart from this latter point in suggesting that dealing with minor incivilities \nand local disorder can have some effect on the incidence of crime \u2013 in short, it is not all about \nroot causes (Sousa and Kelling 2006). Evidence from the two studies reported above appears \nto suggest public support for this idea: opinions of the police may be based primarily on the \nprevalence of such problems and implicitly on the police\u2019s ability to deal with them. But such \na suggestion would probably be mistaken. Recall that the bulk of the effects described above \ncan be attributed to perceptions of disorder; the issue of \u2018broken windows\u2019, in policy terms at \nleast, is aimed at addressing real disorder and decay. If it is broader concerns about decline in \nsociety which drive perceptions of disorder and through them confidence in the police, such \nroot causes of confidence are indeed likely to be deeper than fixing broken windows (Kelling \nand Coles 1996) can address, no matter what effect such policies may have on crime itself \n(Harcourt 2001; Xu et al. 2005). \nFinally, it is notable that the analysis presented here replicates results from more \nrecent waves of the BCS in suggesting that confidence is higher among those from Black and \nAsian ethnic groups than it is in the majority White population.x Such findings seem \ncounterintuitive in light of the ideas positioning the police as representative of nation, state \nand belonging. It might be assumed that the ethnic majority feels more affiliation to structures \nwhich it, after all, dominates. However, analysis of data from 20 years of the BCS (Bradford \n2008) has shown that the current position is primarily a result of falls in trust and confidence \namong Whites relative to other groups. It may be that association of the police with a present \nexperienced as fragmented and troubled, with the concomitant stresses on confidence this \nimplies, is particularly keenly felt among those who cling most firmly to the other vision of \npolicing, that which conjures up images of a more cohesive national past and which is linked \nto a story of decline. Such people seem likely to be over-represented in the White group \ncompared with others, although further work would be needed to properly substantiate this \nclaim.    \n \n8. Conclusions \nWhat \u2013 in this final analysis \u2013 are the implications of this paper for public policy? With high \n 16 \nprofile initiatives of \u2018reassurance\u2019 policing currently taking place across England & Wales \u2013 \ninitiatives that are intended \u2018to impact upon the linked problems of fear of crime and lack of \npublic support\u2019 (Sharp 2005: 456) \u2013 there  is a pressing need to systematically assess what \ndrives public confidence in policing. It is sometimes said that fear of crime erodes faith in the \ncriminal justice system. The public has an exaggerated and irrational sense of the crime \nproblem, meaning the police do not get the credit they deserve when crime rates fall, as they \nhave done over the past decade and more. If this idea is correct, to improve public support the \npolice might look to dampen down excessive fears and correct inaccurate beliefs about crime, \nperhaps by educating the public or by publicizing police successes. Yet this study suggests \nthat narrow attempts to reduce fear and communicate the reality of crime will not improve \npublic confidence. Rather, people look to the police to defend everyday civility, norms and \nsocial controls, and when these are seen to be under threat, individuals lose faith in the \neffectiveness of their local police force. Disorder, cohesion and moral consensus \u2013 these are \nthe things that people feel. Individuals look to the police to defend group cohesion and values \n(Sunshine & Tyler 2003b; Jackson & Sunshine 2007); formal agents of social control are \ncalled upon when informal processes are seen to be failing (cf. Hawdon\u2019s (2008) discussion of \nsocial capital and public confidence in the police). \nThis study supports current policing strategies that look to engage more and more with \nthe day-to-day social order of civil public space and civil society. In particular, it backs the \nsignal crimes perspective underpinning reassurance policing strategies being carried out \nacross England and Wales (Innes 2004b; Millie & Herrington 2004; Herrington & Millie \n2006). A reassurance strategy seeks to increase the visibility, accessibility and familiarity of \nthe police (Innes 2004a). It looks to identify those (symbolic) events that the public identify as \ntroubling \u2013 those which signal a weak social order \u2013 and deal with them. In this way, the \npolice hope to improve fear of crime and public confidence in policing, rendering the police \nas a more visible symbol of social control (see Manning 1997, 2003). The findings here \nsupport reassurance policing strategies: both fear of crime and public confidence in policing \nflow from day-to-day signs of social cohesion and control. Moreover, narrow attempts to \nreduce public concerns over safety will not improve public confidence; programmes to \naddress lay concerns about disorder and informal social control are much more likely to \nsecure support for the police (Bridenball and Jesilow 2008; Innes 2004a, 2004b). The public \nappear to demand what Loader (2006) calls \u2018ambient policing,\u2019 as described in a series of \narticles by Innes (which prefer the labels \u2018reassurance policing\u2019 and \u2018signal crimes\u2019). \nIf some crimes are signals not only of criminality, but also provide messages about a \nbroader set of social problems, it is possible that these are driving perceptions of disorder and \nlack of informal social control and in turn affecting confidence in the police. The signal \ncrimes approach suggests that it should be possible to identify these crimes and provide a \npolicing response to them, resulting in increased reassurance, decreased fear of crime and \nother benefits. However it should be noted that the model developed here holds perceptions of \ndisorder and community cohesion (and  mediated through these \u2018real\u2019 community \ncharacteristics, such as crime rates) to be driving fear of crime, not the other way round. A \nmuch wider set of issues than just signal crimes appears to be generating generalized fear of \ncrime. Even if these important crimes were dealt with adequately the much greater range of \nsocial issues they signal, present in people\u2019s lives in many other ways, will still have an \nimpact. \nIn the public mind, then, notions of \u2018crime\u2019 and \u2018policing\u2019 seem to stand for the form \n 17 \nand structure of society, for things that threaten or protect values and morals, and for how \nsuccessfully society regulates itself. Such representations range far beyond generally accepted \nnotions of what \u2018crime\u2019 is or who should deal with it. Disorders and incivilities as much as \ncrimes per se communicate the failure of the community to self-regulate. Experiences of these \narouse passions \u2013 they strike at the norms and values of the group, attack community \ncohesion, and reveal inadequate social controls. The police, representatives of both \ncommunity (nation) and state, become associated with, and blamed for, these failures. This \nmay be why crime and policing are so salient in the public mind: they reveal, specifically, the \ncondition of the community and, generally, the state of society. When people think about \ncrime and policing they think about social control and cohesion, about the norms, morals and \nvalues of certain groups, and the state of social order: concerns about crime and police \neffectiveness may thus serve as a lay seismograph of social cohesion and moral consensus.  \n 18 \nNotes \n                                                 \ni There has been a small number of notable North American studies that capture the various \nrelationships between fear of crime, concerns about neighbourhood disorder, and public confidence in \npolicing. Cao et al. (1996) drew on data from a postal survey of Cincinnati residents to show that \nrelatively strong public concerns about neighbourhood disorder (and separately) collective efficacy \nwere associated with relatively low levels of confidence in police effectiveness and engagement with \nthe community. Importantly for the current study, fear of crime was a statistically significant \npredictor of public confidence, before neighbourhood concerns about disorder and collective efficacy \nwere included in the regression model, but not after. Reisig & Parks (2000) analyzed data from \ntelephone interviews of residents of Indianopolis (Indiana) and St. Petersburg (Florida)  to assess the \nrelative contribution of four factors in explaining levels of confidence in the police: encounters with \nthe police; perceived neighbourhood conditions (crime levels, safety on the streets walking alone after \ndark, disorder, and general satisfaction with the area as a place to live); and actual neighbourhood \nconditions (census measures of concentrated disadvantage, and police measures of homicide rates). \nThey found that perceptions of neighbourhood conditions (all were statistically significant net of the \neffect of covariates), encounters with the police (negatively-received encounters had the biggest \neffect) and concentrated disadvantage (but not homicide levels) all predicted levels of confidence. \nIndeed public perceptions of their neighbourhood were stronger predictors of public confidence in the \npolice than (a) neighbourhood levels of poverty and homicide and (b) encounters with the police \u2013 \nfurther evidence that the public hold \u2018the police accountable for the quality of life in the \nneighbourhood\u2019 (Reisig & Parks, 2000: 610). A third study found that Canadians tended to be less \nsatisfied with their local police when they perceived high levels of disorder around them (Sprott & \nDoob, 2008); however, perceptions of personal safety was also a statistically significant predictor of \nconfidence, even holding constant public concerns about disorder. \nii Moreover, people who identified with the morals and values the police represent were more likely to \nexpress confidence in police activities. Drawing on social identity theory from social psychology, the \nargument put forward was that people look to the police not just to defend group values and norms, \nbut also to exemplify them, because the police are authorities of the group. Social identity theory \npredicts that people judge the authority of the group by the extent to which that authority is a \nprototypical representative of the group, and this is especially so for people who strongly identify \nwith the group. This was found to be the case with the police (Jackson & Sunshine 2007). One way \nthat the police communicated the values they espoused was through the dignity and fairness with \nwhich they were seen to treat people (e.g. Sunshine & Tyler 2003b; Tyler & Huo 2002). \niii In the BCS data, deprivation is compiled at the Electoral Ward level. The 2004 IMD measures \nseven dimensions of deprivation: income, employment, health, education, barriers to housing and \nservices, crime and the quality of the living environment. The crime dimension combines police \nrecorded crime statistics for the time period April 2002-March 2003 for burglary (covering 4 recorded \ncrime offence types), theft (covering 5 types), criminal damage (covering 10 types) and violence \n(covering 14 types). The quality of the living environment dimension covers measures of the \ncondition of social and private housing, the number of houses without central heating, air quality, and \nroad traffic accidents (with all data centred around 2001). \niv The British Crime Survey includes a complex sampling design with weights. This affects our \nanalysis in two ways: first we need to weight to make up for unequal sampling probabilities; and \nsecond we need to be careful about any possible effect of design effects on the size of standard errors. \nWe dealt with former by including as covariates in the regression modeling a variable that captures \nthe type of area in which respondents live (inner-city, urban or rural) and a variable that measures \nhousehold size (number of adults in the house). Holding constant these two factors allows us to \nweight for unequal address selection probabilities across Police Force Areas, for unequal individual \nselection probabilities, and for inner-city non-response. The latter issue (design effects) means that \nstandard errors are underestimated due to the complex sampling design. To correct for this we would \n 19 \n                                                                                                                                                       \nrequire primary sampling unit identifies. However the Home Office does not release these data for \nreasons of anonymity. Moreover the 2003\/04 BCS Technical Report does not report design effects for \nthe relevant variables, which would allow us to correct this manually. \nv Measures of the frequency of worry were used (for discussion, see Farrall & Gadd 2004; Farrall \n2004; Hough 2004b; Jackson 2005; Gray et al. in press). \nvi A three-stage sample selection process was employed within each ward, entailing: random \nprobability sampling of household addresses; the random selection of a dwelling unit in cases where a \nsingle address included more than one unit; and the random selection of an adult to be targeted for \ninterview in cases where a household contained more than one adult. \nvii One of the limitations of traditional regression modelling is that one estimates the statistical effects \nof the explanatory variables on the response variable \u2013 when the explanatory variable increases by \none unit of membership we predict a particular change in the response variable \u2013 but one implicitly \nassumes that a change in one explanatory variable is not related to a change in another explanatory \nvariable. By contrast, structural equation modelling allows one to model such knock-on effects. In \nStudy Two, the (standardised) effect decomposition was as follows. The total effect of \u2018concerns \nabout long-term social change\u2019 was 0.245 (.105 direct and 0.140 indirect through perception of \ndisorder, informal social control, and worry about crime). The total effect of \u2018attitudes towards law \nand order\u2019 was 0.048 (all indirect through perception of disorder, social cohesion\/informal social \ncontrol, and worry about crime). The total effect of \u2018perception of neighbourhood disorder\u2019 was 0.421 \n(0.362 direct and 0.059 indirect through worry about crime). The total effect of \u2018perception of \nneighbourhood informal social control\u2019 was 0.076 (0.069 direct and 0.008 through worry about \ncrime). The total effect of worry about crime was 0.069 (all direct). \nviii We should add that the core finding (that public perceptions of neighbourhood disorder and social \ncohesion are more strongly associated with confidence in policing than fear of crime) replicate across \nnumerous sweeps of the British Crime Survey (Jackson et al., in press). \nix One drawback of this study is that confidence in policing was measured using a global measure. \nFuture work should treat public confidence in policing as multi-dimensional (see Sunshine & Tyler, \n2003a & 2003b). In fact following Home Office consultation the 2005\/2006 BCS fields an expanded \nset of indicators that cover numerous components, including perceptions of the fairness and integrity \nof the police. These items will allow a more complete assessment of public confidence in policing. \nx Of course, \u2018White\u2019 in this context includes people who are not White British and therefore not part \nof the ethnic majority in the UK. However within the White group views of White British people are \nlikely to be very dominant. \n  20 \nReferences \n \nAnderson, B. 1983 Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origins and Spread of \nNationalism, London: Verso. \nBannister, J. 1993 \u2018Locating Fear: Environmental and Ontological Security\u2019, in H.
