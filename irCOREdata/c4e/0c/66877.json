There is overlap in the time periods concerned, with Aris looking at the\nrole of trade unions and the State in the management of industrial conflict in the years\n1910\u201321, and Beynon and Austrin, whilst focusing more sharply on the single case of\nthe Durham miners, covering the period from the beginning of the nineteenth century\nuntil the end of the 1930s. Here the similarities end and while both books succeed well\nin their own terms, they contrast greatly in their methodology and ultimately their\nwhole approaches to historical sociology.\nThe approach taken by Rosemary Aris is the more \u2018traditional\u2019 of the two. It is as\nthe author acknowledges \u2018a study of industrial conflict from above, not below\u2019. The\nauthor is at her strongest when analysing the written records of Royal Commissions, or\npapers of the Ministry of Labour, Ministry of Munitions and so on. Some fascinating\ninsights are thus generated into the machinations of the Whitehall machine and its\ninformants. This side of the story is well told and in itself justifies buying the book.\nPerhaps less strong is the wider analytical framework in which some of this material\nis located. It begins with a fairly well-worn discussion of three approaches to the role of\ntrade unions and industrial conflict. The revolutionary school suggests that the State\nwill seek to incorporate trade-union leaders in order to drive a wedge between the\nleaders and the rank-and-file members, ensuring that direct action and radicalism are\ncontained within the workplace. Such a cynical attempt at incorporation is contrasted\nwith the second approach, that of corporatism, which suggests that trade unions will\ngenuinely pass from being interest groups to becoming estates of the realm. Finally,\nthere is a revisionist approach which is strongly critical of the very existence of a\nwidespread rank-and-file movement, attributing agitation to a small minority of activist\nworkers.\nThe author goes on to consider some of the detail of historical developments during\nthe period. Ultimately, however, the book is constrained by the tripartite framework to\nwhich Aris returns in the conclusion. She suggests that the evidence upholds a\nmodified version of the rank-and-file approach. The modification is important\nbecause, rather than positing an essentially radical rank and file, Aris suggests that the\nmass of workers are characterised by inconsistency; they will fight for immediate issues\nby the only means available.\nThere are echoes here of the position taken by Michael Mann (1982), suggesting\nSOCIOLOGY Vol. 33 No. 4 November 1999\n831\u2013834\nthat working-class consciousness is characterised by internal inconsistency. Should we\nsee such an account in the way that Gordon Marshall (1988) has characterised the\nwork of Mann, as a retreat from explanation? I prefer to see this part of the conclusion\nas reflecting the sources used and the methodological approach taken. If the account is\nbased upon \u2018history from above\u2019 then the attribution of consciousness must at best be\nreconstructed from \u2018perceived perceptions\u2019, in which the inconsistency of the mass is\noften brought into sharp relief with the more reflexive policy making of the State. Such\na position is likely to be strengthened when the primary focus is upon the nature of\nconflict, rather than a more rounded dialectic including consensual elements.\nSimilarly, a focus upon the sharp points of conflict tends to privilege economic struggle\nover more political and cultural counter-forces.\nThe detail of the book is suggestive of other factors. Thus, in relation to the\nexplosion of unofficial action predicated upon labour shortage and resulting in wage\ndrift in the wake of the First World War, the author notes that the Board of Trade\nconsidered workers to be insufficiently under the sway of \u2018ordinary economic control\u2019.\nShe goes on to quote the permanent secretary of the Board of Trade who opined that\n\u2018the difficulty . . . is that the workmen, though engaged in armaments work, still feel\nthemselves to be working essentially for private employers with whom they have only a\ncash nexus and that in the present circumstances a cash nexus is quite inadequate to\nsecure control\u2019 (p. 103). He went on to argue the need for legislative control and the\nappeal to patriotism, which he considered \u2018a motive not of a purely economic\ncharacter\u2019. What insights such as this suggest is that in order to evaluate the\nconsistency, or otherwise, of consciousness, and so produce an analysis adequate at the\nlevel of meaning, we need to be aware of the plurality of frames within which people\nattempt to live their lives. What may appear as (inter-) subjective inconsistency when\nconsidered within one frame, such as industrial conflict, may rather point to more\nobjective complexities once a plurality of frames, economic, political, religious and\naffective are considered.\nIt is exactly this complex context that is developed in Beynon and Austrin\u2019s account\nof the development of the Durham Miners Association. Their point of departure is the\napparent paradox that within the Durham coal-field, where they detect a stronger\nworking-class sub-culture than elsewhere, why should it be that the labour organisation\nhas been dominated by traditions of moderation, officialdom and respectability? Their\noverall answer to this question is similar to Tom Nairn\u2019s characterisation that the\nEnglish working class have constituted a class \u2018for themselves in themselves\u2019, yet it is\nthe exquisitely detailed route taken to this position that makes this book a classic.\nThe mining industry in the Durham coal-field represented, from its very\nconception, a paradox. Coal mining was an industry of modern capitalism and yet in\nDurham the coincidence of land ownership and capital interest perpetuated almost\nfeudal relations. It called into being wage labour in a society dominated by the\ninstitutions of aristocratic rule within an essentially rural society. It produced figures\nsuch as Lord Londonderry, who were capitalist but not of the bourgeoisie. Their\nallegiance was to county society rather than the commercialism of the city. As a\nregional force in the early nineteenth century the owners of the land and the owners of\nthe mines combined as effectively as any medieval guild to restrict the output of coal in\norder to keep prices high in the London market, using a system known as \u2018the vend\u2019.\nThe stamp of paternalism could be seen in the dealings of the owners with the\nlabourers, through what the authors describe as the \u2018Durham system\u2019. This involved\nthe use of tied housing, which accommodated 90 per cent of the workers in the coal\nfield, far higher than elsewhere. However, it also extended into free medical attention,\nschooling and education, the provision of money for social events, flower shows,\ncolliery bands, etc. Paternalism as an ideology gave employers their sense of place, its\npractices linking the employer to the worker.\n832 IAN ROBERTS\nThat link was stronger than in other modern industries due to another aspect of the\nDurham system, the fact that until 1872 it was bonded, not free, labour that was\nemployed in the coalfield. All of these aspects combined in the Durham system to\nensure that relations between capital and labour were about more than the cash nexus.\nAs the authors suggest: \u2018It was a contract which extended beyond wages, establishing\n(via \u201cfree\u201d housing and coal) economic control into the very fabric of civil society in\nthe mining districts. So too was it used as a flexible method for disciplining labour\u2019 (p.\n32). It was the struggle against bonded labour which saw the beginnings of the\nDurham Miners Association (DMA), a struggle which gained in intensity once\nexternal pressures had affected a collapse of the vend in the mid-1840s, obliging the\nemployers to seek to maximise output. A first problem that confronted those trying to\norganise trade-union activity was that the employers controlled almost all the public\nspaces in the villages. There followed an elective affinity between the available\nautonomous physical space and the autonomous moral standpoint from which to\noppose the employers: both were provided through primitive Methodism. The former\nwas within the physical space of the chapel and the latter was the opposition of the\negalitarian organisational forms and substantive content of primitive Methodism to the\nhierarchy of the established Church to which the employers owed allegiance.\nThe emphasis on respectability and morality represented both a religious\ncommitment and a yearning for acceptance as human beings within village, county and\nultimately national life. Such a stance was not without complication, in particular there\nwere evident tensions between local and national level unionism, and between rank\nand file and county leaders. By 1872, with the repeal of the bond, the DMA could\npoint to the securing of \u2018free\u2019 labour as the assertion of place in society. As the union\ndeveloped it secured formal recognition of place yet in turn was colonised by the old\norder. As symbolic of this was the establishment of the union regional headquarters,\nRedhills, in Durham (the citadel) rather than in Newcastle, the commercial centre.\nOver time the power of the DMA was to become secularised as new generations owed\nallegiance more to the Independent Labour Party and socialism than to Methodism\nand liberalism. This movement was accompanied by an increasing exercise of political\npower in local government and ultimately in supplying MPs.\nAn emphasis on respectability rather than revolution remained, with political power\nbeing lodged with union men, whilst economic power remained with the pit owners.\nThe Durham Miners Association developed from initial principles of morality imbibed\nwithin the organisational pragmatics and ethical egalitarianism of Methodism to the\nresponsibilities of exercising established power over communities in local government.\nThe model of the paternalist employer served well as a mould for the development of\nlabourite municipal socialism. In this sense, the position that the DMA constructed\nwas one in which they were \u2018strong enough for reformism\u2019.\nThe range of sources deployed by Beynon and Austrin is truly impressive, from the\nuse of Hansard and national-level agreements to local written material, individual\nbiographies and oral history. In this way the account contrasts with the Aris book in\nbeing an example of both history from above and history from below. In attending to\nissues as diverse as the iconography of the union banner, the position of women in the\nmining villages, the role of the co-op and the club this account comes as close as any\nsociology does to capturing a comprehensive account of the lives of the people\nobserved.\nBoth of the books considered here are useful additions to sociological literature.\nThe account by Aris is well researched and its use of primary data delivers a real\naddition to our knowledge about industrial conflict during the period. Beynon and\nAustrin have, I believe, delivered something rather more profound: here there is life!\nRADICALISM AND RESPECTABILITY IN LABOUR ORGANISATIONS DEVELOPMENT 833\nReferences\nMANN, M. 1982. \u2018The Social Cohesion of Liberal Democracy\u2019.
