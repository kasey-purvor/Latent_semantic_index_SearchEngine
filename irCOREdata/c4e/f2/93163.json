This paper seeks to contribute to debates about the role of participation in health by suggesting how social \npsychological concepts can add to the theorisation of participation. It criticises traditional concepts of development and \nintroduces some of the challenges that are present for development and community theorists in conditions of rapid \nglobalisation. The paper proceeds to demarcate the space which a social psychology of participation occupies within the \nterrain of existing research into the health-society interface. The concepts of empowerment and social capital are identified \nas important starting points to address the relative lack of social psychological attention to community-level determinants of \nhealth. It is suggested that social identities, social representations and power are crucial elements for constructing a social \npsychology of participation. The paper concludes by highlighting the vital link that should exist between the development of \ntheory and practical interventions. Paulo Freire's notion of conscientisation is a guiding notion throughout the paper. \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThe poorest people in the world are also the ones with poorest health. Despite years of concerted action by the WHO and \nother international agencies we are nowhere nearer to achieving the ambitious goals laid out in the \"Health for All by the \nYear 2000\" initiative. Poverty and other forms of social exclusion continue to be key determinants of health inequalities both \nbetween countries and within countries in the north and the south. It has been suggested that community participation could \nplaya key role in policies and interventions seeking to reduce health inequalities. In this paper we seek to contribute to \ndebates about the role of participation in health by suggesting how social psychological concepts can add to the theorisation \nof participation. In particular, we shall highlight the way in which the concepts of social identity, social representations and \npower--as well as Freire's concept of conscientisationm--form key starting points for the development of a 'social \npsychology of participation'. \nThe pathways whereby inequalities impact on health are many and complex. Apart from the direct effects of socio-\neconomic deprivation on health, members of marginalised groups often lack the material and\/or symbolic resources to deal \nwith health-damaging stress. Social exclusion undermines peoples' access to health-related knowledge. It also impacts on the \nvalue that people place on local health-related knowledge and skills, where these are not consistent with mainstream \napproaches to health and healing. People who lack the power to shape their life course in significant ways are less likely to \nbelieve that they can take control of their health, and thus less likely to engage in health-promoting behaviours (Bandura, \n1996). \nThose concerned to reverse the trend of health inequalities pit their energies at various levels. Some work at the level of \ngovernments, some at the level of nongovernmental organisations. Some seek to promote partnerships between the public \nand the private sectors. Others work to formulate and implement health-promoting social policies at the global, national, \nregional or local levels. Some work directly in the areas of health. In the current climate of 'joined up thinking', others work \nto create alliances between health activists and representatives of social sectors which impact on health in more indirect \nways, such as welfare, housing, transport, womens' issues, education and employment. \nEach of these levels of struggle forms an essential backdrop for our interest in community development and participation \nas one of the strategies for addressing health inequalities. Within the area of health promotion, in particular, recent years \nhave seen \"a paradigm drift\" away from biomedical and behaviourally oriented interventions and policies towards a \ncommunity development perspective (Beeker et al., 1998). This perspective is driven by the insight that it is only through \nthe participation and representation of grassroots communities in planning and implementing health programs that such \nprograms are likely to have an impact. \nThere are various forms of participation that are important for health. These can impact directly or indirectly on health. \nFirstly, there is growing recognition of the need to involve local community groupings in strategic and operational decisions \nabout health service design and delivery. This is deemed crucial for addressing issues such as differential access, cultural \ndifferences, racism, and communication difficulties which are often believed to undermine the level of health service \nprovision received by marginalised groups (Dept. Health, 1999). Secondly, it is argued that local community groups should \nparticipate in designing and implementing grassroots initiatives to promote healthy behaviours, given that people are far \nmore likely to change their behaviour if they see that liked and trusted peers are changing theirs (Dube and Wilson, 1996). \nThirdly, more indirectly but equally importantly, there is a growing recognition of the influence of local \ncommunity\/neighbourhood conditions on health, with studies emphasising that social cohesion and strong local networks \nbenefit health in a range of indirect ways (Baum, 1999a). In this regard, health promoters are increasingly becoming \ninvolved in general 'community strengthening' programmes, which seek to create 'health-enabling communities', \n                                                 \n1 This paper was published in the Journal of Community & Applied Social Psychology (2000), Vol. 10: 255-270 \n \ncharacterised by trust, mutual support and high levels of involvement in local community projects of mutual interest. \nYet, despite the growing emphasis on participation amongst those concerned with health inequalities much remains to be \nlearned about the processes and mechanisms whereby participation and representation have a positive impact on health and \ncommunity development. Partly this gap can be explained by the difficulties associated with theorising practical \ninterventions. Too often there has been a lack of communication between practitioners on the ground and theoreticians in \nuniversities. This communication, however, is vital. Another reason is the resilience of the biomedical model, which has \nmanaged to persist in practice, despite the participatory rhetoric that has characterised international declarations and policy \ndocuments, more particularly in the wake of Alma Ata in 1977. The individualism of the biomedical model has conveniently \nserved to mask the contribution of economical and political inequalities to patterns of ill health. \nWe can identify at least three reasons why it is important to develop a theoretically grounded social psychology of \nparticipation. Firstly, it is theoretically important because attention to the concept of participation can illuminate the \nrelationship between individual and society, which is the central problem of social psychology. Secondly, it is pragmatically \nimportant for health policy and intervention in the light of some evidence that participation leads to improved health \noutcomes. Thirdly, it is politically important insofar as it addresses broader issues related to democracy and citizenship, \nwhich need a social psychological dimension in order to be properly understood. \nThe remainder of this paper is organised in three sections. The first one locates the problem of community participation \nwithin the context of development. We criticise traditional conceptions of development and introduce some of the challenges \nthat are present for development theorists and community workers in conditions of rapid globalisation. We then proceed to \ndemarcate the space which a social psychology of participation occupies within the terrain of existing research into the \nhealth-society interface. We identify the concepts of empowerment and social capital as important starting points to address \nthe relative lack of social psychological attention to community-level determinants of health. In the third section we \nintroduce what we believe are crucial elements for constructing a social psychology of participation. Social identities, social \nrepresentations and power are the conceptual tools that guide our efforts. We conclude by highlighting the vital link that \nshould exist between the development of theory and practical interventions. Paulo Freire's notion of conscientisation (Freire, \n1970; 1973) is a guiding notion throughout the paper. \n \nPARTICIPATION AND DEVELOPMENT IN CONTEXT \nIn the last four decades or so, the two dominant conceptions of development were modernisation, the traditional model of \ntechnology transfer associated with the political right, and dependency, the model associated with the political left (Hobart, \n1993). Despite their differences, both strands shared the underlying assumption that development was an issue of 'catching \nup', and that eventually less developed contexts would achieve the stage of more developed ones. Developed societies stood \nas 'the model' to be followed, which, coupled with a strong emphasis on the ideology of progress, determined the aspirations \nand goals of development interventions. It is now widely acknowledged that development interventions in less developed \ncountries are not just a matter of transferring information and technological 'fixes' from more developed contexts. This top-\ndown approach to development has failed to recognise local resources and the problems involved in the cultural and material \ndifferences between contexts (Apffel-Marglin & Marglin, 1990). It has also become clear that the developed world is far \nfrom being free of the problems that are found in less developed circumstances. \nTransformations imposed by conditions of late modernity and globalisation take the problem of development today far \nbeyond the traditional north-south divide and uncover the importance of understanding each context in its own right. \nAlthough it would be a mistake, and indeed undesirable, to neglect the enormous disparities between countries of the north \nand countries of the south, globalisation has taken the problem of inequalities and development to a different level of \ncomplexity. With a few exceptions around the globe, the presence of poverty transcends the traditional boundary of Third \nWorld locations. There are pockets of poverty and wealth in most countries today2 \nAs globalisation institutes new co-existences between wealth and poverty and threatens traditional communities and ways \nof life, the recognition of local contexts emerges as one of the key tasks in development programs (Atte, 1992). Without \npaying attention to local realities and trying hard to understand and integrate local systems of knowledge, community \ndevelopment interventions remain partial. The tendency to undermine local knowledge has been traditionally founded on the \nbelief that development agents 'know best'. Health promoters and educators saw the knowledges they conveyed as the \ndesirable ones, and were inclined to overlook the implicit assumptions embedded in this conception, namely, that there is a \nhierarchy of know 1edges-their knowledge was the 'best', and local knowledge was considered to be 'ignorance'. These \nhidden assumptions, commonly found in health promotion interventions, give ample support to Foucault's description of \nsubjugated and dominant knowledges (Foucault, 1980). They can also explain the mistrust and resistance with which local \npeople tend to receive outside workers. \nDevelopment initiatives which recognise local representations and ways of life are, on the other hand, more likely to be \nrelevant and to generate sustainable and successful interventions (Atte, 1992; Brokensha, Warren and Werner, 1980). There \nare a number of lessons to be learned from the experience of context and the way this experience produces knowledge, \n                                                 \n2 In the context of development debates. poverty remains the key form of social exclusion in countries of  the South. Abrahamson (J \n995) correctly points to the need to recognise other forms of socia] exclusion besides poverty, particularly in the context of countries \nof the North. The interface between social exclusion and health goes far beyond the problem of poverty, to include issues such as \nethnicity. gender and sexual orientation, amongst others. \n \nexpertise and practices which emerge from, and at the same time respond to, the concrete conditions under which a group of \npeople live. In the case of less developed communities there exists a long tradition of coping and inventing resources to \ncounterbalance the chronic absence of information, state support and welfare. Community and development workers now \nrecognise that peripheral communities have developed strategies of survival based on their cultural traditions and local \nknowledge to respond to the urgent needs they usually face. \n In the field of health, networks of solidarity based in neighbourhood conviviality and kinship relations have been central \nto provide care and social support (Seabrook, 1986; Stacey, 1986). In the same manner, local knowledge has a great deal to \noffer. It equips local people with impressive arrangements to cope with the everyday and a vast stock of resources to make \nthe best of it. These resources are expressive of both cultural traditions, handed down across generations and linked to the \nidentity of a community, and the pragmatics of everyday life, where the dynamics of poverty and exclusion produces its own \nresponses to alleviate hardship. The recognition of this portfolio of assets (Moser, 1998) is crucial to establish productive \nalliances between local communities and development workers. As the communication between different worlds and ways \nof life increases and as more dominant worldviews meet peripheral ones, it becomes crucial to establish dialogues between \nlocal understandings and the outside researchers, development workers and scientific practices that penetrate local \ncommunities (Agrawal, 1995). \nThe role of local knowledges in community development is a complex issue, however. There will be occasions where \nlocal understandings can be detrimental to the well being of local populations. Community and development workers will be \nfamiliar with situations where local communities express discourses and practices which are at variance with health. In our \nown work in Brazil, for example, we have to engage with mothers who use 'cacha\u00e7a' (a cheap and highly alcoholic drink) in \ntheir babies' bottles. While this is a highly adaptive practice, which serves to quieten, comfort, and warm up babies while \ntheir mothers are earning a living, it also produces alarming levels of alcoholism in infants under the age of five (Unicef, \n1988). From our perspective as social psychologists, we know that alcoholism can seriously compromise not only the health \nof these children but also their general life prospects. \nWe don't know, however, what the mothers know and undergo: a hard life, in conditions of poverty, usually alone, with \nminimal material and emotional resources to bring up their children. To establish a constructive dialogue between what \"we \nknow\" and \"they know\" is a necessary pre-condition for promoting the health and living conditions of these children. \nWithout exchange of views and perspectives, our attempts to work with these communities will only meet resistance, \nmistrust and failure. \nThus development interventions in the community can be based on a different assumption: the recognition of different \ntypes of knowledge and expertise and the possibility of establishing a dialogue between them with the objective of critical \nawareness. Here, development interventions are not a matter of transferring knowledge from agents who know better to \nrecipients who are in a state of ignorance, but a joint action between agents who hold different knowledges and pertain to \ndifferent cultural traditions (or different levels of affluence in the case of community interventions with excluded social \ngroups within the same culture). \nSuch a conception follows closely Freire's discussion of development projects (1973). While discussing 'extension', which \nwas the word used to describe development projects in the Third World, he makes clear that \"the effort required is not one of \nextension but of conscientiza\u00e7\u00e3o\" (p. 110).3 The concept of conscientisation is at the core of Freire's pedagogy and it has \nbeen central to social psychological work in the community in Brazil and Latin America. Conscientisation is the process \nwhereby critical thinking develops. It contains several stages, starting from 'intransitive thought', where people believe that \ncontrol over their lives is out of their hands and fate defines their experience. They do not see their own actions as capable of \nchanging their conditions. God or luck are seen as the way out of their often very poor living conditions. 'Semi-transitive \nthought' is the next stage towards conscientisation. Here people partly believe in themselves as motors of chance and to \nsome degree they try to act in order to produce social change. Their understanding of their situation, however, is still \nfragmentary, insofar as they fail to connect their particular problems to the larger societal determinants underlying single \nsituations. The final stage, which Freire calls 'critical transitivity' corresponds to the achievement of conscientisation. It \nrefers to a dynamic relationship between critical thought and critical actions triggered by the ability to think holistically and \ncritically about one's condition. This level of consciousness is never given, but always achieved through a social process of \nlearning characterised by dialogical and participatory relationships. A critically transitive thinker feels empowered to think \nand to act on the conditions that shape her living. \nAccording to Martin-Bar\u00f3 (1994: 18) \"the now well accepted concept of the awakening of critical consciousness \n(conscientizaci6n) joins the psychological dimension of personal consciousness with its social and political dimension, and \nmakes manifest the historical dialectic between knowing and doing, between individual growth and community \norganization, between personal liberation and social transformation\". In dialogical communication, actors can develop an \nappreciation of reality which was not there before: they construct awareness about their conditions of living not only for \nthemselves but also for those who work with them. It is this awareness that pushes a community into participating action \nand, in a dialectical way, reinforces the very existence of their community links. \nFreire's considerations are in line with a great deal of recent work on development and community projects (Rappaport, \n                                                 \n3 The Portuguese word conscientiza\u00e7\u00e3o is difficult to translate in English and translators of Freire's work frequently use the French prise \nde conscience, or leave the Portuguese word in the middle of the English text, as in the case we quote above. In this paper we use the word \nconscientisation, the choice of many of Freire's English translators. \n \n1987). The key issues guiding these interventions revolve around the idea of empowering communities to participate both in \nthe construction\/consolidation of the relationships that form the community itself, and in larger social arenas where \nrepresentations and resources are disputed. By participating and consolidating the level of community action, deprived \nsectors can proclaim\/reclaim their interests in the public sphere, reaffirm their identity in relation to other social groups and \npressurise channels of decision making and institutional power to respond to their needs. This level of community \nparticipation, which is embedded in a struggle over knowledge, identity and resources, becomes central to thinking about \nhealth in conditions of poverty and exclusion. \n \nHEALTH AND SOCIAL RELATIONS \nWhile issues of empowerment and participation have long received attention within the fields of community psychology as \nwell as the social psychology and sociology of health, we still lack a social psychological theorisation of these processes. In \nthis section we seek to demarcate the space which a social psychology of participation can occupy within the terrain of \nexisting debates about the society-health interface. Researchers have pointed to an array of variables, which mediate \nbetween social relations and health at various levels of analysis. At the individual level of analysis much work has been done \ninto physiological pathways between social stresses and health (Wilkinson, 1999). Also at the individual level of analysis, \npsychological work has been done on concepts such as self-efficacy (Bandura, 1996), sense of coherence (Antonovsky, \n1984), and social identity (Stockdale, 1995), all of which have been associated with positive health outcomes. At the inter-\nindividual level we have concepts such as social support (Cohen and Syme, 1984), social networks (Berkman, 1995) and \nperceived relative deprivation (Wilkinson, 1996). Sociologists and epidemiologists have provided ample evidence for links \nbetween health and factors at the macro-social level of analysis such as ethnicity, social class and gender (Blane et al., 1996; \nGordon et al., 1999; Nazroo, 1998). \nMany gaps remain in our understandings of community level determinants of health, however. In particular, as we will \nargue below, much work remains to be done in examining the processes whereby community networks and relationships \nimpact on health. There is also need for attention to the mechanisms whereby such community level factors are shaped by \nbroader macro-social relationships, particularly amongst socially excluded groups, who often have the poorest health status. \nAn understanding of these processes is essential if we are to understand the mechanisms through which community \nparticipation might serve as a health promotion strategy. \nThe health promotion research literature provides two useful starting points for filling these gaps in our understandings of \nthe community-level determinants of health: the concepts of empowerment and social capital. Much work has been done on \nthe concept of empowerment (Rappaport, 1987), conceptualised as a community-level construct impacting on health. \nDrawing heavily on the ideas of Freire, this work starts with the assumption that powerlessness or a \"lack of control over \ndestiny\" severely undermines the health of people in chronically marginalised or demanding situations. Peoples' ability to \ncope with such stresses depends on their access to political, economic or psychological resources. Many people in low \nincome countries, or those living in conditions of high relative deprivation in high income countries, do not have access to \nsuch resources. They are thus particularly susceptible to the negative health effects of their life stresses (Wallerstein, 1992). \nIn addition to being more susceptible to stress, disempowered people, who have little control over important aspects of their \nlives, are less likely to feel that they can take control over their health, and are thus less likely to engage in health-enhancing \nbehaviours. Within this context, empowerment, the process whereby people gain control in their own lives in the context of \nparticipating with others to change their social and political realities, is posited as a health-enhancing strategy (Rappaport, \n1987). Here again, we can identify the centrality of Freire's notion of conscientisation. \nResearch studies have sought to make links between empowerment at the individual, community and organizational \nlevels (Israel et al., 1994). It has been argued, however, that in practice, research examining the impact of interventions and \npolicies aimed at promoting empowerment has often tended to focus on outcomes at the individual, psychological, \nbehavioural and biomedical levels, with inadequate attention to community-based processes and community-level outcomes \n(Labonte, 1994). As an antidote to such criticisms, there has been an upsurge of work describing those features of \ncommunity that serve as preconditions for successful community empowerment. Phenomena such as 'sense of community' \n(McMillan and Chavis, 1986), 'community competence' (Eng and Parker, 1994) and 'collective efficacy' (Sampson et al., \n1997) have each been cited as features of community most likely to enhance the health of their members either directly \nthrough promoting the likelihood of health-enhancing behaviours, or indirectly through serving to buffer the effects of stress. \nThe concept of 'community capacity' has also generated much interest. In their definition of community capacity for \nsuccessful health promotion, Goodman et al. (1998) emphasise the importance of leadership, citizen participation, skills, \nresources, social and inter-organisational networks, sense of community, understanding of community history, community \npower, community values and critical reflection. \nDespite the excellent quality of many such studies of community-level determinants of health, there is a lack of \nconceptual coherence when one attempts to pull together these findings, and the cumulative impact they might otherwise \nhave had, is severely diluted. We argue that one reason for this fragmentation lies in the theoretical paucity of this area of \ninterest. Researchers offer a variety of descriptions of surface level aspects of community-but much scope remains for the \ndevelopment of theoretical frameworks seeking to explain the underlying social psychological mechanisms whereby \ncommunity empowerment impacts on health. \nRecently, much attention has been given to the possibility that the concept of ' social capital' might provide an integrative \nframework for conceptualising those features of community most likely to enable and support health-enhancing behaviours \n(Campbell, Wood and Kelly, 1999; Kawachi et al., 1997; Lomas, 1998). Putnam (1993) defines social capital as the \ncommunity cohesion resulting from four features of community: (i) the existence of a dense range of local community \norganisations and networks; (ii) high levels of civic engagement or participation in these community networks; (iii) a strong \nand positive local identity and a sense of solidarity and equality with other community members; and (iv) generalised norms \nof trust and reciprocal help and support between community members, whether or not they are personally known to one \nanother. It has been argued that people are more likely to be healthy in communities characterised by high levels of social \ncapital (Gillies, 1998). \nAlong these lines, it has been noted that an important determinant of the success of participatory health promotional \ninterventions is the extent to which they mobilise or create social capital (Kreuter, 1997). Social capital is considered to be \nimportant for health promotion for two reasons. Firstly, communities that are rich in social capital are said to provide a \nsupportive context within which people can collectively re-negotiate social identities in ways that promote the increased \nlikelihood of health enhancing behaviours. This emphasis on social identity is important given that health enhancing \nbehaviours are determined more by collectively shaped social identities than by individual rational choice, as assumed in \ntraditional information-based health education. Secondly residents of communities with high levels of social capital are most \nlikely to have high levels of perceived control over their everyday lives. This is important for health, given that people who \nfeel in control of their lives in general are more likely to take control of their health, through health-enhancing behaviours, or \nthrough the speedy and appropriate accessing of health services (Campbell, 2000). These points resonate with insights from \nthe work on empowerment and are also directly linked to the concept of conscientisation. \nThe notion of social capital has taken strong hold in the discourse of leading international development agencies, and the \ntask of building or enhancing local social capital is increasingly regarded as a key dimension of a wide range of health-\npromoting development initiatives in disadvantaged settings. However, much work remains to be done if social capital is to \nbe a useful conceptual tool for the design and evaluation of health promotional programmes aiming to reduce health \ninequalities. \nIn particular, the concept has been criticised for its failure to engage with the way in which various forms of social \nexclusion undermine stocks of social capital in marginalised communities (Wallace, 1993). While Putnam's \nconceptualisation of social capital is the one most frequently cited in health promotion circles, critical social scientists have \nexpressed concern that a focus on community-level determinants of health could serve to displace attention from the well \nestablished links between health, poverty and racism (Muntaner and Lynch, 1999). Such critics argue that Bourdieu's (1986) \nconcept of social capital might be a more appropriate starting point for understanding health inequalities, with its emphasis \non the role played by different forms of capital in the reproduction of unequal power relations (Baum, 1999b). \nThe concept of social capital has generated a great deal of controversy and criticism, with much of this discussion posed \nas a polarised argument about the possible relative benefits of community-level (i.e. social capital) and macro-social (e.g. \nracism, poverty) explanations of health. In our view neither community-level nor macro-social determinants of health can be \nunderstood without reference to the other. Community-level factors will often playa key role in mediating between social \ndisadvantage and health. Thus, for example, poverty is clearly a primary cause of health inequalities-and the economic \nregeneration of deprived communities is essential for reducing such inequalities. However, if one of the effects of poverty is \nto undermine health-enhancing community networks and relationships, economic regeneration must be accompanied by \nsocial regeneration (i.e. projects to enhance social capital) if it is to have optimal success in improving health (Gi1lies et at., \n1996). \nIn the same vein, Labonte (1999) expresses concern that concepts such as social capital and participation are dangerously \nambiguous. On the one hand, they serve as potential tools for critical social theorists who argue that it is only through \ngrassroots participation in strong community-based organisations that socially excluded people will gain the power to lobby \ngovernments to recognise and meet their needs. On the other hand, such concepts have the potential to be 'hijacked' by \nneoliberal, free market theorists, who argue that grassroots organisations and networks have the power to take over many \nfunctions (e.g. welfare) previously assigned to governments. Such arguments can serve as justifications for cuts in welfare \nspending in more affluent countries of the north, and reduced development aid to poorer countries in the south. Labonte's \narguments highlight the vital importance that critical social scientists locate conceptualisations of social capital, participation \nand community development against the backdrop of wider conceptualisations of power. \nWhile agreeing with the concerns expressed above, it is our view that the concept of social capital could result in a useful \nframework for conceptualising community level influences on health. It needs further development along two dimensions, \nhowever. Firstly, there is a need to theorise the larger power mechanisms that shape and constrain the potential influence of \nsocial capital on health. Secondly, there is a need to explicate the social psychological mechanisms whereby social capital \nand the community participation it entails impact on health. We turn to these issues in the next section. \n \nTOWARDS A SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY OF PARTICIPATION \nParticipation is a key notion for social psychologists. Generally absent from the theoretical concerns of the discipline, \nparticipation is nonetheless a phenomenon that brings together most of the classical areas of study in social psychology. \nParticipation involves individual and social awareness, as well as a public sphere capable of taking into account the demands \nof democratically negotiated projects. In this sense, the concept of participation is central in the task of reflecting and \ntheorising community. Indeed, we argue that it is through participation that the key constituents of community are enacted. \nCommunity and participation are, in this way, intrinsically linked and we need to discuss the two concepts in relation to each \nother. \nThere are three key dimensions that need to be unpacked in order to understand the formation of community in \nparticipation. When speaking of community we refer to a group of people who 1) share an identity which the community is \nable to articulate; 2) share a set of social representations which organises the worldviews of community members and \nguides their interpretation of reality and their everyday practices; 3) share the conditions and constraints of access to power, \nboth in terms of material resources and symbolic recognition. Participation, as the enactment of these dimensions, is the \nprocess whereby community is actualised, negotiated and eventually transformed. \nIt is through participating that a group of people can develop awareness about its own resources and can engage with \nsignificant others in the public arena. These significant others, as we discuss below, can be dominant, oppressive, potential \nallies, peer communities, and so on. Awareness about its own conditions and identity, acquired in the process of engaging \nwith others and stating a project, takes us back to Freire's conscientisation-the process of constructing critical awareness \nabout oneself and the world. Thus, rather than being a given, which can be measured, community participation is an \nachievement of social and individual life. \nSocial identities, social representations and power are the social psychological phenomena which guide our theoretical \nefforts to think about the act of participation and the development of conscientisation. The first two have been extensively \ndiscussed by social psychologists, and the latter has been increasingly incorporated into the discipline through the work of \ntheorists such as Foucault (1980) and Bourdieu (1994). \n \nParticipation and social identities \nTo date, the concept of identity has played a central role in three bodies of literature that are relevant to our interests in \ncommunity, participation and health. The first relates to debates about the causes of health-related behaviour. In contrast to \nviews that health-related behaviours are determined by individual rational choice, the social identity literature emphasises \nhow actions are shaped and constrained by collectively negotiated social identities (Stockdale, 1995). Thus, for example, \nusing a condom, or visiting a traditional healer, is an act structured by a social identity. Secondly, social identity plays a key \nrole in on-going debates about how to define a community. Many community development projects have been criticised for \nmechanically locating communities within bounded geographical regions. Alternatively, critics have argued that it cannot \nnecessarily be assumed that people who live in a particular geographical area constitute a community-and that the key \ncomponent of a community is that its members share a common social identification. Thus it is argued that community \ndevelopment workers should seek to locate their efforts within 'communities of identity' rather than simply assuming the \nexistence of 'communities of place' (Barnes, 1997). Finally the concept of social identity plays a key role in debates \nregarding the processes whereby unequal power relations are reproduced or transformed. Identities are constructed and \nreconstructed within a range of structural and symbolic constraints which often place limits on the extent to which people are \nable to construct images of themselves that adequately reflect their potentialities and interests (Leonard, 1984). However, at \nparticular historical moments, members of socially excluded groupings may indeed come together to construct identities that \nchallenge their marginalised status. In some circumstances, such empowered identities may form the basis of collective \naction to improve peoples' material life circumstances or to raise the levels of recognition they receive from other social \ngroups. In such a situation, social identities become potent tools for social change. \nThe notion of conscientisation pulls together these three perspectives on identity. Conscientisation occurs at the moment \nat which members of a socially excluded grouping are able to 'state' their identity in a way that asserts recognition of their \nneeds and interests, and in a way that demands recognition of these needs and interests by other sectors of society. It is in the \nact of participating that these processes are enacted and realised in the public sphere, and identity becomes an arena of \nstruggle by disadvantaged groups. In this way, participation is a process that depends upon, and in turn, helps to construct \nidentities. Participating is an action organically linked to the awareness a social group possesses of who it is, what it wants \nand how it projects itself in a future time horizon in which its identity can be perpetuated, renegotiated and, if desired, \nchanged. \n \nThe importance local knowledge: participation and social representations \nWithin social psychology, the theory of social representations has provided an interesting and fertile ground to think about \nthe problem of local knowledge (Jodelet, 1991; Jovchelovitch, 2000; Moscovici, 1981, 1988). Devoted to the understanding \nof knowledges produced in everyday life, the theory is focused on how a community of people, in communication and \npractices, comes to construct a shared view of the world. This shared view of the world, which is made of multi-faceted and \noften oppositional knowledge about surrounding social objects and people, organises and guides the relationship \ncommunities have amongst themselves and with others. These knowledges are never detached from the concrete social and \nhistorical contexts from which they emerge. On the contrary, they are organically linked to the cultural traditions, the social \nidentities and the material conditions of living of a community. In this sense they are not only lay knowledge 'about \nsomething'; they are also expressive of how communities hand down, sustain and negotiate their cultural identities, ways of \nlife and strategies for survival and living. Embedded in this knowledge we find the practical and symbolic resources \ndeveloped by communities as they engage in the process of living. \nHowever, everyday knowledges are also embedded in ideological mechanisms that conspire to obfuscate and distort the \nperceptions a group of people possess about their ways of life. As much as it is necessary to recognise the local knowledges \nexpressed in the social representations held by a community, it is also important not to idealise them. No human group is \nimmune to ideological distortions and to the obliteration of critical understandings of the range of dimensions that construct \nthe conditions of their living. As we discussed earlier in this paper, as social psychologists we need to engage with what \nlocal knowledge expresses and how it impacts on the construction of community participation and of its health practices. \nThe case of condom use among the mining population in South Africa can elucidate this point. As Campbell (1997) has \nshown, representations of masculinity serve as a crucial survival strategy in dangerous working conditions. At the same \ntime, these representations see men as risk takers, which undermines the likelihood of condom use and increases levels of \nHIV infection amongst men and their partners. These representations are adaptive, insofar as they allow men to work and \nearn a living in conditions where one in forty men is killed, in a work-related accident, in a 20 year career. These same \nrepresentations, however, increase the chances of HIV infection. Without understanding the double-edged nature of these \nrepresentations, efforts to increase condom use are unlikely to be successful. \nIt is the process of participation that forms the on-going arena that allows social representations to be expressed, \nreaffirmed, and if necessary, renegotiated. Participation involves the process of negotiation of worldviews and projects. It \nprovides a forum for the establishment of dialogues between different representations-as in the case of community workers, \ngovernments, development agencies, NGOs, scientists and local populations-and for the clashes between competing \nrepresentations and projects. It allows the formation of potential alliances between different knowledges as well as the \nclashes associated with the confrontation of social representations within and between communities. It is here that we need \nto consider the power differential between communities since not all projects and representations are equally recognised in \nthe public arena (Jovchelovitch, 1997). \n \nPower and participation \nWhile new emphasis on participation expands the scope of decision making and opens up new spheres of debate and \nlegitimation, it also introduces the problem of how local communities appropriate and make sense of the act of participating \n(Nelson and Wright, 1995). We cannot just suppose that every community will participate in a similar way. The level of \nknowledge about, and practices related to, participation varies among communities. In this sense, it is not sufficient to say \nthat grassroots participation is central to the construction of communities and improved health outcomes. It is necessary to \nask questions about the conditions under which participation is enacted. These questions point to the power differentials \nbetween different social actors and to how they may have unequal access to the material and symbolic resources most likely \nto equip them in forcefully negotiating projects and worldviews in the public sphere. \nIn this debate it is important to take into account the double edged character of power. On the one hand, we must not lose \nsight of asymmetries between people and how different social groups hold different levels of power to participate in \nconstructing life projects that meet their needs and interests. The power to act is always limited not only by material \ninequalities, but also by the recognition others confer on what is done. Participation in conditions where material and \nsymbolic obstacles prevent the possibility of real social change can be a hollow exercise. It legitimises the status quo rather \nthan providing an opportunity for marginalised people to pursue their needs and interests. Our understandings of the \nmechanisms whereby material and symbolic constraints may impact on a group's potential to participate in ways that \nenhance their interests and even improve their health are still in their infancy. This is an important area for future research. \nOn the other hand, conceptualisations of power must allow for the possibility of empowerment. Power is not a \nphenomenon to be explained only through an intrinsic negativity, but as a space of possible action, where social subjects \nstrive to exert their effects. As a space of possibilities, power is not an a priori but depends on the contingencies of the \nvarious contexts in which it is exercised (Arendt, 1958; Bourdieu, 1994 ). \nAs Arendt (1958) has pointed out, power is inextricably linked to that realm where people, in action and speech, \nparticipate in the everyday negotiations that bring different representations and identities into dialogue. Power, in this sense, \nis deeply intertwined with participation. It refers to being capable of: to be able to produce an effect, to construct a reality, to \ninstitute a meaning. Whenever a community participates and develops a way of knowing about itself and others, it is, by the \nsame token, instituting itself as such, inviting a future for what it does and indeed, actualising the power it holds to \nparticipate in shaping a way of life. Attention to these moments is vital to bring social change into a theory of participation. \nIn fact, social change through participation can only be properly understood if one understands the ambiguity of power \nrelations and the double-edged nature of power. The dialectic of constraints and possibilities is the motor of social change \nand as social psychologists, we have a role to play in unpacking the mechanisms implicit in this process. \nIn the foregoing we have discussed the elements which in our view form the framework for a social psychological theory \nof participation. We have argued that social identities, social representations and power (both material and symbolic) are the \nkey dimensions for such a framework. It is also important to point out that each of these dimensions is intrinsically related to \nthe other. It is impossible to think about identity and representations without taking into account power relations and vice-\nversa. These inter-related phenomena are at the basis of participatory processes and play an important role in projects of \ncommunity development for improving health. \n \nCONCLUSION \nIn this paper we have shown how a social psychological dimension can be introduced in issues related to community \ndevelopment, participation and health. We have highlighted how our understandings of development programs can benefit \nfrom being attentive to the psychosocial dimensions of local communities. We have also examined the relative lack of \nattention to community level determinants of health in the existing literature, and pointed to the value of the concepts of \nempowerment and social capital as potential bridges to a social psychological theory of participation. We have argued that \nsuch a theory could fill the gaps in our understandings of the social psychological processes whereby empowerment and \nsocial capital impact on health. \nWe pointed to three key elements towards the development of a social psychology of participation: social identities, social \nrepresentations and power. We argued that community participation is the meeting point of these three phenomena. Through \nparticipation, a community states and negotiates identities and social representations, which are, in turn, shaped and \nconstrained by the material and symbolic power relations in which they are located. We have suggested that the double-\nedged nature of power needs to be understood in order for the theory to adequately take account of social change. We may \nalso add that this point is an important one for social psychology in general, given its focus on the relationship between \nindividual and society. As Markova (2000) has correctly pointed out, social change is the arena in which this relationship is \nmost appropriately and most fruitful1y examined. \nThe final judge of the fruitfulness of the ideas we discussed here must be the extent to which they may be useful in \napplied contexts. In putting together this paper we have been guided by experiences in our countries of origin, Brazil and \nSouth Africa, where debates between theory and practice, social theory and social change, psychology and social justice \nhave long taken place. In developing our arguments Freire's notion of conscientisation was a key reference. It is through the \nfact that Freire was simultaneously an activist and a theoretician that this concept has been inspirational for community \ndevelopment workers in a range of poor countries and contexts. We are not surprised that it is increasingly informing the \ndebate about participation in countries of the north. As a concept, it keeps alive the vital need to link theory and practice, \nwithout undermining either. It also stresses how much can be learned from concrete and practical interventions, where \ntheories are put into use and must show how fertile they are, not only in pointing towards ways of understanding the world, \nbut also in changing it. \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nWe would like to thank Ian Rees-Jones, Geoffrey Stephenson and Anna Ziersch for their helpful comments on a previous \nversion of this paper. \n \nREFERENCES \nAbrahamson P. 1995.
