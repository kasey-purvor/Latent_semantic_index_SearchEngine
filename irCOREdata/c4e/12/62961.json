These data demonstrate that some behavioural components \nof stress coping styles can be modified by experience, whereas behavioural plasticity \nis limited by genetic effects determining social position early in life story.  \nKEYWORDS: physiology, limited plasticity, coping strategy, social dominance \n \n 3\nINTRODUCTION \nWithin the last decade, it has been clearly established that individual animals \nof various species (vertebrate and invertebrate) differ in the nature of their response to \nchallenges. Such differences may involve suites of correlated physiological and \nbehavioural traits and are often referred to as \u201ccoping strategies\u201d (Koolhaas et al., \n1999). In mammals and birds, two distinct coping strategies can be distinguished. At \none extreme, animals with a proactive coping strategy tend to show a fight-flight \nresponse, to be more aggressive and bold (in the sense of taking risks in a variety of \ndangerous situations), and to have low levels of plasma corticosteroids. In contrast, at \nthe other extreme, reactive animals show a freeze-hide response; tend to be shy and \nless aggressive with a more flexible behaviour than proactive individuals. The \nphysiological response to stress in reactive individuals involves relatively higher \nplasma cortisol levels, as well as differences in a number of other neuro-endocrine \nsystems (Koolhaas et al., 1999; Korte et al., 2005).  \nIn several species it has been shown additionally that such differences in \nphysiological and behavioral stress responses are heritable (Van Oers et al., 2005; \n\u00d8verli et al., 2005; Koolhaas et al., 2007), which raise a question about how such \nvariability is maintained within populations. The emerging consensus is that proactive \nand reactive animals flourish in different selective environments, possibly in a \nfrequency-dependent manner. Some authors have likened proactive and reactive \nanimals to the hawks and doves of classical game theory (see for example Korte et al., \n2005). The existence of such adaptive individual differences within a population has \nevoked considerable scientific interest and has important consequences for disciplines \nas diverse as evolutionary ecology (Bolnick et al., 2003; Sih et al., 2004), animal \n 4\nhusbandry (Cavigelli, 2005; Huntingford and Adams, 2005) and biomedicine (Korte \net al., 2005).  \nOne outstanding question is the relationship between behavioural plasticity \nand underlying physiological mechanisms (\u00d8verli et al., 2007). On the one hand, if \nbehaviour is closely linked to strongly heritable physiological traits (as in Miller et al., \n2004; Uhart et al., 2004; Serretti et al., 2006; Poirier et al., 2007), this may limit \nbehavioural plasticity. On the other hand, some components of the neuroendocrine \nmachinery are rapidly modifiable by experience (e.g. Burmeister et al., 2005; \nBurmeister, 2007; Watt et al., 2007) and this is likely to be reflected in plasticity in \nassociated behavioural traits. The results presented in this paper provide an example \nof flexible dissociation of behavioural and physiological components of the coping \nstrategy, using an established fish model, the rainbow trout (Onchorhynchus mykiss, \nWalbaum, 1792).  \nA number of studies have documented the existence of co-varying behavioural \ntraits in teleost fish (e.g. Bell and Sih, 2007; Wilson and McLaughlin, 2007). For \nexample, a positive correlation between aggression towards conspecifics and risk-\ntaking in various potentially dangerous situations has been described in three-spined \nsticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus, Huntingford 1976, though see Bell and Stamps \n2004), brown trout (Salmo trutta, Sundstr\u00f6m et al., 2004), and grayling (Thymallus \nthymallus, Salonen and Peuhkuri, 2006). There is relatively little information on \nphysiological correlates of such behavioural variability in fish, though Bell et al., \n(2007) report a correlation between individual risk-taking behaviour and brain \nbiochemistry in sticklebacks. The rainbow trout provides an exception, in that a \nnumber of behavioural differences have been reported in strains of rainbow trout \nselected for high (high responsive, or HR trout) and low (low responsive, LR) cortisol \n 5\nresponsiveness to a standardized stressor (see reviews by \u00d8verli et al., 2005; \nSchjolden and Winberg, 2007).  \nThe first behavioural study conducted on these strains documented that fish \nfrom the LR strain become socially dominant over HR fish (Pottinger and Carrick, \n2001). In addition, following transfer from group rearing to isolation in an unfamiliar \ntank, trout from the LR strain resumed feeding earlier than did fish from the HR strain \n(\u00d8verli et al., 2002a). It was later shown that rapid resumption of feeding following \ntransfer to a novel environment also predicts social dominance and level of aggression \ntowards territorial intruders in non-selected aquaculture strains of rainbow trout \n(\u00d8verli et al., 2004; Schjolden et al., 2005a). Most of the behavioural characteristics \nof the HR line are consistent with previously reported effects of the steroid hormone \ncortisol in non-mammalian vertebrates (Gregory and Wood, 1999; \u00d8verli et al., \n2002b; DiBattista et al., 2005). However, it seems unlikely that cortisol alone is \nresponsible for controlling all behavioural aspects of stress coping style (Koolhaas et \nal., 2007; \u00d8verli et al., 2007). \nIn this paper we present data indicating that cortisol responsiveness and \nbehavioural profiles may be uncoupled. After 3 generations showing distinctive \nbehavioural profiles, a batch of HR and LR rainbow trout were transported from their \noriginal rearing site (Windermere, UK) to Oslo, Norway. Unexpectedly, immediately \nafter transport both strains switched behavioural profiles, with HR fish now being \nbolder in terms of rapid resumption of feeding behaviour after transfer to isolation and \nexhibiting social dominance over LR fish. The divergence in post-stress plasma \ncortisol concentrations between strains remained unchanged in transported as well as \nnon-transported fish from the same generation. These data suggest a degree of \n 6\nplasticity in the behavioural aspects of coping style in fish that is independent of \nhypothalamus-pituitary-interrenal function.  \n \nMATERIALS AND METHODS \nOutline of screening regime \nResults presented here come from studies carried out on the third and fourth \ngenerations of LR and HR rainbow trout. Observations were made both at the original \nrearing site (CEH Windermere, UK) and after transport between this site and an \nexperimental facility in Norway. Weights below are given as mean \u00b1 S.E.M. Details \nof the selection programme used to generate the HR and LR strains have been \ndescribed previously (Pottinger and Carrick, 1999 and 2001), as has their typical \nbehaviour (Pottinger and Carrick, 2001; \u00d8verli et al., 2002a; Schjolden et al., 2005a; \nSchjolden and Winberg, 2007).  \nIn the summer of 2005, adult 3rd generation HR (n = 150, weight 493 \u00b1 12 g) \nand LR fish (n = 150, weight 477 \u00b1 9 g) were fitted with Passive Integrated \nTransponder (PIT) tags and transported from the Windermere Laboratory of the UK \nCentre for Ecology and Hydrology (Windermere, UK) to the Norwegian Institute of \nWater Research Marine Research Station (Solbergstrand, Akershus County, Norway). \nFish were deprived of food for 5 days prior to transport and then loaded in a tank \ntruck equipped to transport fish (Donslund Special Transport, Hejnsvig, Denmark). \nTransported fish arrived two days later and no mortalities occurred during transport. \nUpon arrival in Norway all PIT-tags were registered, fish were weighed and screening \nfor behavioural and physiological traits initiated. Individual identification of fish with \nPIT-tags permitted body mass loss during the 7 day period of transport to be assessed, \nsince energetic status is a variable that may strongly influence risk-taking and social \n 7\nbehaviour (e.g  Johnsson et al., 1996; Damsg\u00e5rd and Dill, 1998); however, due to \nlogistic reasons the body mass of some fish could not be measured. \nFour sessions of behavioural testing were carried out. Immediately after \ntransport adult HR (n = 23 weight: 448 \u00b1 21 g) and LR fish (n = 23 weight: 457 \u00b1 16 \ng) were tested for risk-taking (boldness). Data for this trait are not available for non-\ntransported fish, but previous studies reported that adult LR fish resume feeding more \nrapidly than HR fish at the original rearing site (\u00d8verli et al., 2002a). Social \ndominance and plasma cortisol following an acute stressor were also assayed in \nNorway. Simultaneously in Windermere UK, non-transported 3rd generation adult fish \n(n = 16 weight: HR 742 \u00b1 41 g, n = 16; LR 645 \u00b1 28 g) were tested for social \ndominance and post-stress plasma cortisol. In Norway, one year later in the summer \n2006 a set of HR (n = 18 weight: 1113 \u00b1 65 g) and LR (n = 18 weight: 1108 \u00b1 61 g) \nfish, transported the year before, were screened for the same behavioural traits as in \n2005. Finally, 8 months old 4th generation offspring (n = 16 weight, HR 16.2 \u00b1 0.9 g, \nn = 16; LR 16.4 \u00b1 0.9 g,) generated from transported F3 fish were screened for the \nsame behavioural and physiological traits in August 2006. \nScreening for boldness and social dominance \nPrior to screening, fish were transferred from communal rearing tanks to 250 l \n(adult fish) or 12 l (offspring) glass aquaria, where they were held in isolation. Each \nobservation aquarium was lined with black plastic on three sides and divided in two \ncompartments by a removable opaque PVC wall, each section holding one HR or one \nLR fish in weight matched pairs. Prior to transfer from group rearing to social \nisolation each fish was anaesthetised, weighed, and for adult fish the PIT-tag was \nread. Offspring were fin clipped to distinguish between strains, by a small incision in \nthe upper or lower section of the tail fin. \n 8\nFish were allowed to recover overnight and testing started the next day. For \nseven consecutive days, feeding was performed by dropping appropriate sized pellets \nwhere the fish was able to perceive them. Feeding was stopped either when the fish \nhad refused to eat three pellets in a row or had consumed 3.0% of its body mass. \nUneaten food was removed immediately after. Feeding behaviour was graded on each \noccasion according to the criteria listed in table 1, in accordance with the method \npresented by \u00d8verli et al. (2006). There is a high degree of individual variation in the \nspeed of progress from low to high scores on this scale. Accumulated scores during \nthe course of an experiment thus reflect how quickly fish resume normal feeding, and \nhave previously been used as a measurement of risk-taking or boldness in rainbow \ntrout (see \u00d8verli et al., 2006, 2007).  \nAfter the 7th day of feeding, the dividing screen in each aquarium was \nremoved and fish were allowed to interact until the conflict was resolved and \ndominant and subordinate fish could be clearly distinguished. For all the experimental \nsites the conflict did not last more than 3 hours, fish were removed from the \nexperimental tanks immediately after to avoid unnecessary distress. After initial \nfights, subordinate fish showed little or no aggression towards the dominant \nindividual and usually took up a position facing a corner of the tank, while dominant \nfish normally moved around the whole territory frequently chasing the subordinate \nfish (\u00d8verli et al., 1999; Pottinger and Carrick, 2001). After a stable dominance-\nsubordination relationship was confirmed, fish were netted, anesthetized, and the final \nweight and strain of each winner and loser was recorded. A similar procedure was \nalso carried out on F4 offspring in summer 2006. These fish were transferred from \ngroup rearing in 150 l holding tanks to feeding and dominance tests in 12 l \n 9\nobservation aquaria (HR: n = 15, LR: n = 15), or subjected to an acute stress test (see \nbelow).  \nThe above procedures applied to tests carried out in Norway. In 2005 the \nWindermere laboratory was not equipped to carry out feeding tests in glass aquaria, so \nat this location adult F3 fish were assessed for the ability to gain dominance over a \nsize-matched competitor, using 50 l PVC tanks. Size-matched fish from the two lines \n(16 pairs) were held in 50 l tanks for seven days by which time all fish were feeding \nnormally. They were then paired (HR, LR) by transfer to a new 50 l tank and the \npositions of the fish were noted after 3h of interaction. Within each pair the identity of \neach fish was denoted by a panjetted alcian blue dye mark. The latter test was carried \nout to exclude the possibility that the ability to gain social dominance in HR fish is an \nage-dependent phenomenon, as previous studies were carried out on juvenile fish \n(Pottinger and Carrick, 2001). \nStress testing and hormone assays \nFor analysis of the plasma cortisol levels for transported fish, in July 2005 \nadults of the 3rd generation (HR n = 20, LR n = 15) were subjected to a confinement \nstress test (confinement in 12.5 l of water for 0.5 h) after 7 days of rearing in isolation. \nUpon sampling fish were anesthetized in 0.5 g \/ l MS-222, and a blood sample was \ncollected from the caudal vasculature. At CEH Windermere, in October 2005, fifteen \nfish of each line were confined for 2 h in groups of three in a 25 l volume in \npolyproylene tanks receiving a constant flow of lake water. The fish were sedated in \n2-phenoxyethanol (1:2000) and a 1.0 ml blood sample was collected from the \nCuverian duct. Stress testing of offspring by individual confinement for 30min in 0.45 \nl of running water (HR n = 10, LR n = 10) was carried out in August 2006. After \nseparation of plasma, cortisol levels were quantified using a previously validated \n 10\nradioimmunoassay (Pottinger and Carrick, 2001) or (for fish sampled in Norway) a \ncommercial enzyme linked immunosorbent assay kit (Neogen Corporation, \nLexington, USA).  \nStatistical analysis \nFor the fish transported to Norway, strain differences in feeding scores as well \nas body mass loss were assessed with two-sample t-tests. Differences in social \ndominance were analysed by a sign test, calculating the likelihood that observed \nfrequencies of dominant and subordinate fish in each strain represent a 1:1 ratio. \nPlasma cortisol concentrations in LR and HR fish were compared using a two-sample \nt-test for each sampling point. \nAll the procedures were carried out in accordance with the welfare regulations \nfor each country and experimental site; in general, unnecessary distress was avoided. \n \nRESULTS \nRisk-taking \nAs shown in figure 1, HR fish gained higher feeding scores than LR fish immediately \nafter transport, (t = 2.59, p = 0.013) and one year later (t = 4.24, p = 0.001). In 4th \ngeneration offspring of transported fish, LR and HR fish did not differ with respect to \nthis trait (t = 0.50, p = 0.62). \nSocial dominance \nAs expected from previous reports (Pottinger and Carrick, 2001), see figure 2; \nin Windermere LR fish typically became dominant over HR fish (LR dominant in 12 \nof 16 pairs, p = 0.03). Immediately after transport, HR fish tended to dominate over \nLR fish (LR dominant in 4 of 19 pairs, p = 0.001). The following year, there was no \nsignificant difference in the proportion of transported LR and HR becoming dominant \n 11\n(LR dominant in 5 of 11 pairs, p = 1.00). In offspring of transported fish the original \npattern was reinstated, with LR fish becoming dominant in all pairwise encounters (15 \nof 15 pairs, p < 0.001). \nBody mass loss in transported fish \n Among adult fish tested in Norway, on average, HR fish lost almost twice as \nmuch body mass due to stress and food deprivation in connection with transport than \ndid LR fish. (t = 3.43 p = 0.003). Mean body mass of the HR group fell from 458.38 \u00b1 \n27.91 g before transport to 403.57 \u00b1 23.33 g after transport to Norway. The equivalent \nfigures for LR fish were 426.39 \u00b1 18.74 g and 401.37 \u00b1 19.34 g respectively. Body \nmass loss was also less severe among those few HR fish that lost pairwise contests (n \n= 4) than among HR winners (n = 13; t = 4.17, p = 0.014). This pattern was not \nevident in the LR strain, as LR winners and losers did not differ in body mass loss (n \n= 19; t = 0.74 p > 0.05).  \nPost-stress plasma cortisol concentrations \nTable 2 shows post-stress plasma cortisol concentrations (mean \u00b1 S.E.M.) in \ntransported and non-transported adult LR and HR fish, and in 4th generation \noffspring. There was a highly significant difference in post-stress plasma cortisol in \nnon-transported fish, with LR fish showing significantly lower levels (t= 3.52; p = \n0.003). Transported fish maintained this typical divergence in post-stress plasma \ncortisol (t = 3.74; p = 0.001). The offspring of transported fish also showed strain \ndistinctive post-stress plasma cortisol concentrations (c.f. table 2, t = 2.34; p = 0.03) \nas well.  \n \nDISCUSSION \n 12\n These results demonstrate a hitherto undisclosed level of behavioural \nflexibility in selected lines of rainbow trout that serve as a comparative model for the \nstudy of coping strategies. Previous studies on these lines and on non-selected strains \nof rainbow trout have revealed distinct behavioural profiles consistent not only over \ntime, but also across different contexts, similar to the results of studies on proactive \nand reactive mammals (\u00d8verli et al., 2005; Schjolden et al., 2005a and b; Schjolden \nand Winberg, 2007). These physiological and behavioural characteristics of low stress \nresponsive (LR) and high stress responsive (HR) rainbow trout have been conserved \nover at least three generations (Pottinger and Carrick 2001; \u00d8verli et al., 2005). \nAn unexpected change in behaviour occurred in the HR and LR strains \nfollowing a prolonged stressful experience (transfer of the fish from the UK to \nNorway). Previously, LR-trout trout have typically been characterized as taking \ngreater risks when feeding in a novel environment (equates to boldness, but see \u00d8verli \net al., 2007) and becoming dominant in competitive pairwise interactions with size \nmatched HR-trout (Pottinger and Carrick, 2001, \u00d8verli et al., 2002a and 2005, \nSchjolden et al., 2005a). This set of behavioural differences was present in adult fish \nof the third generation kept at the original rearing site. However, these traits were \nreversed immediately after transport to Norway, in which fish experienced a 7 day \nperiod of starvation. After transport HR fish not only resumed feeding sooner after \ntransfer to the novel environment, but also won more pairwise fights than did LR fish.  \n A clue as to a possible mechanistic explanation for the switch in traits may be \nfound in the observation that HR fish lost a greater proportion of their body mass \nduring the transport period than did LR fish. Furthermore, the few HR fish that \nbecame subordinate after transport were characterised by having lost relatively little \nbody mass during transport. It is well established that individuals become bolder and \n 13\nmore aggressive in competition for resources when their need for such resources is \nhigh (Dugatkin and Ohlsen 1990; Morrell et al., 2005; Frost et al., 2007). Thus the \natypical behaviour of HR fish immediately after transport could be due to \nexperiencing a high degree of hunger. Comparable results to those reported here were \ndescribed by Carere et al. (2005), who found that food deprivation modulates the \nexpression of phenotypic traits (namely begging and aggression) in lines of great tit \n(Parus major) selected for high and low exploration speed and aggression. \nBy one year after transport when all the fish had recovered from transport \nstress, inversion of the established behavioural profiles of the two lines was still \nevident. HR fish still took greater risks to feed in a novel environment, although \nindividuals of the two strains were equally likely to win pairwise contests. It is \npossible that a long-term effect associated with the body mass loss that occurred \nduring transport continued to influence the behaviour of the HR fish in pairwise \nfights. Growth rates between 2005 and 2006 (unpublished data) were similar in the \ntwo strains but perhaps HR fish retained a metabolic \"debt\" that they were unable to \ndischarge in their group holding tanks. In the 4th generation of the two lines no \ndifferences between lines were evident in risk-taking during feeding, but LR fish now \nwon all the paired contests. It seems that the ability to win pairwise fights is an \ninherited trait in rainbow trout. The situation with respect to risk-taking is more \ncomplicated and harder to explain; although there is a tendency for LR fish to feed \nmore and sooner than HR fish in generation 4, this difference is not significant.  \nThese changes in behaviour occurred without any associated change in a key \nphysiological component of the coping styles, divergent post-stress plasma cortisol \nlevels, which were maintained throughout the study period. This suggests a degree of \nplasticity in the behavioural aspects of coping style in fish that is independent of \n 14\nhypothalamus-pituitary-interrenal function. A range of other elements of the \nneuroendocrine system (hormones, neuropeptides and transmitters) are also involved \nin the regulation of these behaviours (Winberg and Nilsson 1993; Johnsson and \nBj\u00f6rnsson, 1994; Johansson et al., 2005; Clements et al., 2003; Volkoff, 2006; \nCarpenter et al., 2007) but further work will be needed to assess their role in the \nreversal of behavioural traits observed in the present study. In conclusion, data \npresented in this paper suggest that in rainbow trout genetic differences determine \nsocial position only in early life. Superimposed on this template, some behavioural \ncomponents of stress coping style, including resource holding potential and risk-\ntaking, can subsequently be modified by experience. \n \nREFERENCE LIST \nBell, A.
