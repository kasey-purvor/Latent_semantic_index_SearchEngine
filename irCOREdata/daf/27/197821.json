The right shift \n(RS) theory of handedness and cerebral dominance, developed by Annett from 1972 onward, \noffers resolutions to several puzzles about laterality in the so-called dyslexias. This review of \nfindings in the light of the theory shows that \u201ephonological\u201f dyslexics are less likely to be \nright-handed, while \u201esurface\u201f or \u201edyseidetic\u201f dyslexics are more likely to be right-handed than \nthe general population. \n \n 3 \nMost children learn to read and spell with very little explicit instruction, but some \nchildren have great difficulty. A small but significant proportion of the population is \nfunctionally illiterate. This has huge costs for the people affected and also for wider society. \nMany poor readers have poor awareness of speech sounds (phonology). However, some poor \nreaders do not have poor phonology, but other problems which require different remedial \nmethods. The research reviewed here was undertaken to show that two contrasting types of \nliteracy problem are associated with different types of hand preference.  \nDyslexia \n\u201eDyslexia\u201f is a controversial term for weakness in learning to read or spell which \ncannot be explained by other disabilities or lack of opportunity to learn (reviews, Beaton, 2004; \nVellutino & Fletcher, 2005). Some reject the term as a medical sounding label for a condition \nbetter described as \u201epoor reading\u201f or \u201epoor spelling\u201f (Stanovich, 1994). Some researchers have \nrestricted the term to poor readers who are of normal intelligence, on the assumption that most \npoor readers are handicapped by low ability. Teachers often do not accept this distinction. \nChildren of low intelligence may learn to read well, as do some children with early brain \ninjuries such as the cerebral palsies. \u201eDyslexia\u201f is used here as shorthand for poor reading or \nspelling that cannot be explained by other disabilities or disadvantages. The distinction \nbetween types of dyslexia of interest is not between different levels of intellectual ability, but \nrather between different types of reading problem called \u201ephonological\u201f and \u201esurface\u201f dyslexia \n(Castles & Coltheart 1993).  \n The idea that dyslexics are often left- or mixed-handed was first suggested by Samuel \nT. Orton (1925). He noticed that children with several types of developmental language \nproblem were what he called \u201emotor-intergrades\u201f. In modern terminology this could include \n 4 \n\u201emixed-handedness\u201f and \u201eambidexterity\u201f. Many studies followed Orton\u201fs observations, using \ntwo main research strategies. A \u201eclinical\u201f strategy was to study \u201ecases\u201f of poor readers and poor \nspellers for hand, eye, and foot preferences and to compare these with control children. This \nstrategy generally found about twice as many nonright-handers among cases as controls \n(Hallgren, 1950; Naidoo, 1972). In small samples the difference was often not statistically \nsignificant. A second strategy was a \u201egeneral population\u201f approach, classifying children for \nhandedness and then comparing groups for literacy. This strategy almost invariably yielded \nnothing of interest (Satz & Fletcher, 1987). Not surprisingly overall conclusions were generally \nnegative, and the possible association between handedness and dyslexia was dismissed as \nunimportant (Bishop, 1990). However, in a meta-analysis of clinical studies (Eglinton & \nAnnett, 1994) children with literacy problems were more likely to be nonright-handed than \ncontrol children. Clinicians assessing for possible dyslexia typically record hand and other \npreferences, with the implication that laterality might be part of the problem. But if dyslexics \ndiffer for handedness, why are the majority right-handed?  \nOne of the most securely established facts about dyslexics is a tendency to weakness in \nprocessing speech sounds, described as poor phonology (Snowling, 2000; Wagner & \nTorgersen 1987). This is demonstrated on tasks where one is required to repeat a word with a \nsound missing, such as, \u201cSay sit without the \u201ese\u201f\u201d, or \u201cBind without the \u201ene\u201f\u201d (Stuart, 1990). \nFor older participants the task might be to reverse the initial sounds of two words, such as \n\u201eChuck Berry\u201f to give \u201eBuck Cherry\u201f (Perin, 1983). A problem characteristic of phonological \ndyslexics is inability to read nonsense words or new words that have to be constructed by \ntranslating letters into sounds (or graphemes into phonemes). Some phonological dyslexics \nlearn to read well and enter higher education, but appear to rely on a remarkable visual \n 5 \nmemory for words. However, they must first hear words spoken because they cannot sound the \nwords out for themselves (Campbell & Butterworth, 1985). \n There is a type of dyslexia that was first identified in studies of brain injured adults, and \nlater as a developmental problem in children, called \u201esurface\u201f dyslexia (Patterson, Marshall, & \nColtheart, 1985). This contrasts with phonological dyslexia in that there is no problem in \nreading nonsense words but rather a good grasp of grapheme-phoneme relationships. There is \ndifficulty in reading words which are exceptions to the usual grapheme-phoneme rules, \nirregular words like \u201epint\u201f, \u201eyacht\u201f, \u201epeasant\u201f. These words have to be recognized visually and \nlearned specifically. Surface dyslexics have particular difficulty with homophones, real words \nthat sound alike but have different spellings and meanings such as \u201ethere\u201f and \u201etheir\u201f, \u201eisle\u201f and \n\u201eaisle\u201f, \u201eroot\u201f and \u201eroute\u201f. A nurse complained of her difficulties with \u201esaw\u201f, \u201esore\u201f and \u201esoar\u201f. \nThe different meanings have to be learned along with the different sequences of letters. Further \ntypes of dyslexia have been described (Seymour, 1986) but phonological and surface dyslexia \nare the main types distinguished in children. A similar distinction was made by Elena Boder \n(1973) between \u201edysphonetic\u201f and \u201edyseidetic\u201f dyslexia, and by others using different terms \n(Baron & Strawson, 1976). Studies of handedness in dyslexics have not studied phonological \nand surface dyslexics separately. The idea that this might be important was suggested by the \nright shift (RS) theory. \nRight Shift Theory \nThe RS theory (Annett, 1972) depended on the results of some 10 years empirical \nresearch and theoretical analysis. It was followed by explorations of the implications of the \ntheory in several areas of new research which led to further insights, predictions and tests. This \nprocess was described in a book length review by Annett (2002). Critical comments on Annett \n 6 \n(2002) were given by Corballis (2004), Crow, (2004), Elias (2004) and McManus (2004) with \nauthor\u201fs reply (Annett, 2004). The present paper aims to bring the review of research prompted \nby the RS theory up to date with respect to types of dyslexia and handedness. \nThe RS theory is usually described as a genetic theory because it suggests that a gene \n(RS+) influences human laterality, but it is primarily an environmental theory. Culture also has \nan important role. The theory suggests that the chief cause of lateral asymmetries is accidental \ndifferences in the development of the two sides of the body. In translating the instructions for \nbuilding the skeleton, muscles and nervous system, chance differences arise between the two \nsides, which make one side more efficient that the other. Envisage a pin-ball machine where \nsmall balls are dropped through a central funnel at the top and then fall at random through an \narray of pins below. The outcome is a chance distribution, the classic bell-shaped curve. If the \nballs represent individuals, those falling to the left can be hypothesized to have advantages for \nthe left side of the body, those to the right advantages for the right side, but the majority fall in \nthe centre with no clear asymmetry. Such individuals would be relatively evenly balanced on \nboth sides. The cultural bias to the right hand in all human societies is likely to be sufficient to \npressure most of those in the centre to use the right hand. In terms of relative hand skill, a \n50\/50 distribution of advantage for left and right is expected, but in terms of hand preference \nfor socially relevant actions like writing and eating, there would be more right than left-\nhanders. This is important for the investigation of dyslexia, because even if dyslexics were \ndistributed for hand skill at random, the majority would use the right hand for writing. \n The hypothesis that there is an RS+ gene which displaces the random distribution of \ncarriers in a dextral direction can be envisaged as a small deflector placed just below the outlet \nof the pin-ball funnel which gives an initial bias to the right side. The deflector does not make \n 7 \neveryone right-handed. The balls still fall at random through the pins to give a normal \nprobability distribution but the chances of right-handedness are increased and left- and mixed-\nhandedness decreased in comparison with the unbiased distribution. If a single gene is involved \nthen some people carry two copies and probably have a double bias of displacement to the \nright. The probability of right-handedness is increased, but some will be mixed- and left-\nhanded, even in the RS + + genotype. Measures of hand skill for peg moving find a continuous \napproximately normal distribution of relative differences between the hands. Hand preferences \ncan be thought of as depending on thresholds which vary along the baseline, depending on \ncultural and other influences on the expression and recording of preferences.  \n The RS + gene is a hypothetical construct which does not at present have direct \nempirical foundation but it is supported by circumstantial evidence in the fruitful research \nguided by the theory. The theoretical analysis depends on the idea that the gene is \u201efor\u201f left \nhemisphere speech, which is present in most but not all of the normal population. The gene is \nnot for speech itself but for the lateralization of speech to the left side of the brain. The \nadvantage for speech gives an incidental advantage to the right hand which is controlled by the \nleft hemisphere. The frequency of the hypothesized gene and, therefore, of the genotypes, was \ndeduced from the proportions of cases of speech disorder (dysphasias) with left and right sided \nbrain injuries in patients drawn from the general population. These frequencies were then \nfound to explain handedness in families Annett (1978, 1996). Successful predictions from \ndysphasias to family data in the literature, and in new samples collected subsequently, as well \nas findings for twins, strongly support the hypothesis that the gene is \u201efor\u201f left hemisphere \nspeech (Annett, 2002, 2003). Some people have speech functions located in the right \nhemisphere, suggesting that the RS+ gene is absent. When the gene is absent, asymmetries \n 8 \noccur at random. The key hypothesis here is that RS - - genotypes lack something which \npromotes the lateralization of speech to the left hemisphere so that lateralization occurs by \nchance. \n The estimated genotype distributions imply that almost one half of the population carry \none copy of the gene (RS+ - heterozygotes). Fifty percent is the maximum possible \nheterozygocity for a pair of alleles at a single locus. Just under one in five were estimated to be \nRS - - homozygotes and about one in three RS+ + homozygotes. The genotype frequencies \nsuggest there could be a genetic balanced polymorphism with heterozygote advantage and \nrelative disadvantages for both homozygotes. What could these disadvantages be? \n The most likely disadvantage for those who lack a gene which aids the development of \nspeech in the left cerebral hemisphere would be risk of developmental disorders of speech and \nrelated language functions. Because people at risk lack the genetic shift to the left hemisphere \nthey would be likely to include a higher proportion of left- and mixed-handers than the general \npopulation (although the cultural shift to the right would make the majority right-handers, as \nexplained above). The RS - - genotype could explain the handedness of children with speech \nand literacy problems observed by Orton.  \n What disadvantages are expected of the RS + + genotype? A clue to possible problems \nwas given by the finding that strong right-handers tend to have weak left hands on a test of peg \nmoving skill. Perhaps the typical bias to the left hemisphere is achieved by handicapping the \nright hemisphere. This led to the suggestion that RS + + genotypes might have weak right \nhemisphere functions, such as poor visuospatial abilities. It was also predicted that there would \nbe weakness in sports and other skills that required coordinated performance by two sides of \nthe body. The raised incidence of left-handers among professional tennis players, baseball \n 9 \nplayers, and cricketers is consistent with the presence of RS - - and RS + - genotypes but \nabsence of RS + + genotypes. With regard to dyslexics, among children attending a remedial \nclinic, there was a raised proportion of left- and mixed-handers as expected, but also some who \nwere strongly right-handed for hand skill. Could these children be RS + + genotypes? They \nwould not be expected to have poor phonology but rather over-reliance on left hemisphere \nspeech mechanisms. They might also have other problems possibly associated with \nvisuospatial awareness. Thus a combination of theoretical analysis and surprising empirical \nfindings led to the idea that there could be problems for literacy at both sides of the laterality \ndistribution, phonological dyslexia to the left and surface dyslexia to the right. \nDissociations for handedness \nIn looking for dissociations for handedness between the two types of literacy problem, \nphonological and surface, the aim was to assess representative samples of the population (of \nundergraduates or children, not selected for handedness) and distinguish groups with poor \nliteracy who show, or do not show, weakness in phonology. Another strategy was to select for \nweak phonology in contrast with weakness for real word homophones (Hanley & Gard, 1995). \nThe hypothesis was that those with poor phonology would include more nonright-handers \nwhile those without poor phonology would include fewer nonright-handers than the rest of the \nsample. It is important to recognize, from the overlap of the normal distributions associated \nwith the three genotypes, that differences are not absolute but only a matter of relative \nprobabilities. This makes statistical significance hard to find. There is a strong theoretical \nbackground to the research, but large samples are required for results to be convincing.  \n In studies of undergraduates, who are selected, of course, for relatively good literacy, it \nwas possible to distinguish some with poor phonology and others with weakness for real word \n 10 \nhomophones. Differences for handedness were in the directions predicted. There were more \nleft- and mixed-handers in those with poor phonology and fewer left- and mixed-handers in \nthose weak for homophones (Annett, 1999). In a cohort of nearly 500 schoolchildren, reading, \nspelling, and other abilities were assessed (Annett, Eglinton, & Smythe, 1996). We \ndistinguished poor readers, nearly all of whom satisfied criteria of discrepancy with nonverbal \nintelligence. Among poor readers with poor phonology, 29% were left-handed writers (5\/17) \nwhile among 18 poor readers without poor phonology there were no left-handed writers. In the \nrest of the sample of normal readers and spellers there were 10% left-handed writers.  \nEglinton and Annett (2008) looked at poor spellers (after excluding poor readers). \nSome spelling errors sound like the target word, showing good grasp of grapheme-phoneme \nrelationships. Poor spellers who made good phonetic equivalent (GFE) errors were \ndistinguished from those who did not. Poor spellers not giving GFEs, like phonologically \ndyslexic poor readers, were expected to include more RS - - genotypes, and 24% were found to \nbe left-handed writers. Poor spellers who did give GFEs included 2% left writers. The contrast \nfor poor spellers replicated that for poor readers.  \nSmythe and Annett (2006) looked at the handedness of children with poor phonology \nwho were not poor readers, did not have slow hand speeds during peg moving, and had IQ on a \nvocabulary test of 90+ (so excluding those with signs that might be regarded as evidence of \npathology). Among 30 children with poor phonology there were 23% left-handers. Another \nway to look at this question was to find \u201ecases\u201f who were specifically poor on phonology test \nscores but not poor on spatial ability test scores (as measured by factor analysis). This group \nincluded 29% left-handed writers, and only 19% were consistent right-handers. The difference \n 11 \nbetween the hands for their peg-moving skill did not differ significantly from zero. In other \nwords, the distribution was without bias to either side as expected for the RS - - genotype. \n On the question of the nature of the difficulty of children with surface type dyslexia \namong poor spellers, Eglinton and Annett (2008) tested nonverbal intelligence and gave two \ntests of spatial abilities. None of these measures found any specific weakness, evidence that \nsuggests surface dyslexia is not associated with visuospatial disability. This agrees with other \nresearchers who have also found no visuospatial weakness. However, we did find a tendency \nfor the surface type poor spellers to process homophonic words differently from the \nphonological and control groups. The nature of this difference needs further exploration. \nImplications \nWhat are the implications of this work for research and remediation of dyslexia? There \nare least two types of problem which give rise to difficulties in learning to read and spell in \nnormal schoolchildren. The distinction between phonological and surface dyslexia has been \nmade several times, using different terminologies, but it now has independent support in the \nfinding of differences for handedness. The implication must be that there are different patterns \nof cerebral dominance, different types of underlying problem, and different needs for remedial \nteaching. It is important to recognize that the differences are due to patterns of cerebral \nasymmetry, not to handedness itself. From this perspective, clinicians and teachers who believe \ndyslexia can be cured by treating the handedness are profoundly mistaken and are wasting time \nthat should be spent in teaching reading and spelling.  \nHandedness is a weak indicator of underlying differences for brain asymmetry because \nthe fundamental cause of handedness is any accidental difference between the two sides of the \nbody. The overlap of normal distributions for the three genotypes means that the RS + - \n 12 \ngenotype straddles all the main handedness categories (left, mixed, and right). It is most \nunlikely that classifying normal children for handedness and testing for literacy (the research \nstrategy adopted in most of the negative research in the literature) would yield significant \nfindings because RS + - genotypes are both the most numerous and the most advantageous for \ndevelopment. To find significant effects it is necessary to start with the clinical perspective and \nidentify children with problems. It is then important to distinguish the type of problem, \nphonological or surface in most cases, and then look for differences for laterality. Relatively \nsmall samples can give significant findings if the selection of cases is theoretically driven. The \nerror of combining different types of dyslexia, not distinguishing those with and without \nproblems of phonology, is sufficient to explain the weak and controversial findings in this field \nfor nearly a century. The weakness of statistical findings in previous research does not mean \nthat the issues are trivial. The RS analysis suggests that there are genuine distinctions which \nneed to be made between children with different types of problem because they have different \npatterns of brain asymmetry and require different teaching strategies for remediation.  \n 13 \nReferences \nAnnett, M.
