The5\naw levels assayed were 0.85, 0.88, 0.90, 0.92, 0.94, 0.96, 0.98 and the incubation temperatures6\nwere 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40\u00b0C. Growth and OTA production responses were evaluated for7\na period of 25 days. For growth boundaries, the degree of agreement between predictions and8\nobservations was > 99% concordant for both isolates. The erroneously predicted growth cases9\nwere 3.4-4.1% false positive and 0.7-1.4% false negative. No growth was observed at 10\u00b0C and10\n40\u00b0C for all aw levels assayed, with the exception of 0.98 aw\/40\u00b0C where weak growth was11\nobserved. Similarly, OTA production was correctly predicted with a concordance rate > 0.98%12\nfor the two isolates with 0.7-1.4% accounting for false positives and 2.0-2.7% false negatives.13\nNo OTA production was detected at 10\u00b0C or 40\u00b0C regardless of aw, and at 0.85 aw at all14\nincubation temperatures. With respect to time, the OTA production boundary shifted to lower15\ntemperatures (15-20\u00b0C) compared to the growth boundary which shifted to higher temperature16\nlevels (25-30\u00b0C). Using two literature datasets for growth and OTA production of A. carbonarius17\non the same growth medium, the logistic model gave 1 false positive and 3 false negative18\npredictions out of 68 growth cases and 13 false positive predictions out of 45 OTA production19\ncases.20\nConclusions: The results of this study suggest that the logistic regression model can be21\nsuccessfully used to predict growth and OTA production interfaces for A. carbonarius in22\nrelation to temperature and aw.23\nSignificance and Impact of the Study: The proposed modelling approach helps the24\nunderstanding of fungal-food ecosystem relations and it could be employed in HACCP25\nimplementation plans to predict the risk of contamination of grapes and grape products by A.26\ncarbonarius.27\n28\nKeywords: Aspergillus carbonarius, fungal growth, ochratoxin A, predictive mycology,29\nprobabilistic models, wine grapes30\n31\nIntroduction1\nMycotoxins are natural secondary metabolites produced by fungi on agricultural commodities in2\nthe field and during storage over a wide range of climatic conditions. Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a3\nmajor mycotoxin produced by several fungal species belonging to the genera Penicillium section4\nCircumdati and Aspergillus section Nigri that has nephrotoxic, immunosuppressive, teratogenic5\nand carcinogenic effects on animals and humans (O\u2019Brien and Dietrich 2005; Murphy et al.6\n2006; Richard 2007). Aspergillus carbonarius has a central role in OTA contamination of grapes7\nand wines (Abarca et al. 2001; Esteban et al. 2004; Battilani et al., 2006; Bell\u00ed et al. 2007;8\nPateraki et al. 2007; Visconti et al. 2008), as several strains of the fungus have been isolated and9\nidentified in wine producing countries around the Mediterranean basin (Serra et al. 2003;10\nBattilani et al. 2004; Bell\u00ed et al. 2004a; Mitchell et al. 2004; Tjamos et al. 2004, 2006) and other11\nparts of the world (Chulze et al. 2006; Leong et al. 2006; Romero et al. 2007). The presence of12\nOTA in foods is a major concern in food safety and the European Union has established13\nmaximum OTA levels at 2 \u03bcg kg-1 for wine, grape juice, grape nectar and grape must intended for14\ndirect human consumption, and at 10 \u03bcg kg-1 for dried vine fruits (currants, raisins and sultanas)15\n(European Commission 2005).16\nPredictive microbiology aims at the determination of the responses of a given17\nmicroorganism combining mathematical models with experimental data under certain18\nenvironmental conditions. In general, predictive models can be divided into two main categories,19\nnamely kinetic and probabilistic models. The former determine microbial responses in relation to20\ntime and provide estimates for parameters such as lag phase duration and growth rate. The latter21\ndetermine the probability of microbial growth or toxin production, i.e. whether growth or toxin22\nproduction might occur or not, under a specific range of environmental factors (Whiting 1995).23\nSo far, several modelling approaches have been developed for A. carbonarius to quantify the24\neffect of temperature and aw on fungal growth and OTA production (Bell\u00ed et al. 2004b, 2005;25\nMagan and Aldred 2005; Pardo et al. 2005; Mar\u00edn et al. 2006; Tassou et al. 2007; Romero et al.26\n2007). However, these studies have been focused almost exclusively on the development of27\nkinetic models providing information in the form of growth rate and lag phase duration or28\nproduce response surface and contour plots, whereas there is little information available on the29\ndevelopment of a probabilistic approach to quantify fungal growth and OTA production30\nboundaries for a specific range of environmental conditions. Recently, Mar\u00edn et al. (2008) has31\ndeveloped a probabilistic model to determine the growth\/no growth boundaries and OTA32\nproduction by A. carbonarius in pistachio nuts. To the best of our knowledge, no similar33\nprobabilistic model has been developed so far for A. carbonarius on grapes and grape products.34\nThe objectives of the present work are (i) to develop probabilistic models to predict the35\ngrowth\/no growth and OTA production boundaries of two ochratoxigenic isolates of A.36\ncarbonarius from Greek wine grapes on a synthetic grape juice medium, and (ii) to validate the37\nperformance of the developed models with independent data from the literature.38\n39\nMaterials and methods40\nFungal isolates and growth medium41\nThis work was carried out on two ochratoxigenic isolates of Aspergillus carbonarius (ATHUM42\n5659 and 5660) isolated previously from wine grapes in the Peloponnesus region of southern43\nGreece (Tassou et al. 2007). Both isolates were found to produce OTA when tested in Czapek44\nyeast extract agar (CYA) in amounts exceeding 8 \u03bcg g-1 of substrate, determined by the method of45\nBragulat et al. (2001) after incubation at 25\u00b0C for 7 days. Studies were carried out in vitro using a46\nsynthetic nutrient medium (SNM) with composition similar to grapes between v\u00e9raison and1\nripeness. The medium had the following composition: D(+) glucose, 70 g; D(-) fructose, 30 g; L(-2\n) tartaric acid, 7 g; L(-) malic acid, 10 g; (NH4)2HPO4, 0.67 g; KH2PO4, 0.67 g; MgSO4\u00b77H2O,3\n1.5 g; NaCl, 0.15 g; CuCl2, 0.0015 g; FeSO4\u00b77H2O, 0.021 g; ZnSO4\u00b77H2O, 0.0075 g; (+) Catechin4\nhydrate, 0.05 g; agar, 25 g; distilled water, ca 1000 ml. The pH of the medium was adjusted to5\n3.5 with KOH (2 M). The aw of this basal medium was 0.98, measured by a Novasina6\nThermoconstander RTD 33 (Novasina AG, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland) water activity meter at 20\u00b0C.7\nSNM was modified to 0.85, 0.88, 0.90, 0.92, 0.94, and 0.96 aw by adding different amounts of8\nglycerol (Mitchell et al. 2004).9\n10\nInoculation and incubation conditions11\nBoth fungal isolates were grown on SNM medium for a period of 10 days at 25\u00b0C to obtain12\nsporulating cultures. Spore suspension was obtained adding 15 ml of sterile phosphate buffer13\nsolution (pH 7.0) containing 0.1% of a wetting agent (Tween 80; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany)14\nand softly scraping the surface of the medium with a sterile glass rod to suspend the spores in the15\nliquid phase. The resulting suspension was filtered through sterile medical tissue to remove any16\nmycelial fragments. The final concentration of spores was assessed by a Neubauer counting17\nchamber (Brand, Wertheim, Germany) and adjusted to 106 spores ml-1 with the same buffer18\nmedium. SNM agar plates containing ca 20 ml of solidified growth medium were needle19\ninoculated centrally. Plates with the same aw level were sealed with parafilm and wrapped in20\npolyethylene to minimise desiccation and finally incubated at the required temperatures (10, 15,21\n20, 25, 30, 35, and 40\u00b0C). The effect of temperature and aw on fungal growth and OTA22\nproduction was investigated by means of a full factorial design. Four replicated plates for each23\ntreatment were used and the whole experiment was repeated twice (n = 8).24\n25\nFungal growth assessment and OTA determination26\nFungal growth was observed on a daily basis for an overall period of 25 days and the first day27\nwhere visible growth was evident in each aw\/temperature treatment was recorded. OTA28\nproduction was determined after 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 days incubation following a previously29\ndescribed HPLC screening method (Bragulat et al. 2001). An agar plug of 3 mm radius was taken30\nfrom the central area of each colony, weighed, vortexed with 0.5 ml of methanol and kept in the31\nsolvent for 1 hr. The extracts were filtered (Millex\u00ae Syringe Driven Filter Unit, Millipore Co.32\nBedford, MA, USA) and stored at 4\u00b0C until HPLC analysis. Analysis was performed with a33\nHPLC system (Hewlett Packard Series 1100), equipped with an Agilent 1100 fluorescence34\ndetector (330 nm excitation wavelength; 460 nm emission wavelength). Chromatographic35\nseparations were performed with a C18 Waters Spherisorb ODS2 column (5 \u03bcm, 250\u00d74.6 mm).36\nThe flow rate of the mobile phase used (acetonitrile: water: acetic acid; 51:47:2) was 1 ml min-1.37\nThe detection limit of the method was 0.01 \u03bcg OTA g-1 of SNM.38\n39\nModelling of the growth\/no growth interface40\nFor each replicate response of the two fungal isolates, visible growth or no growth were scored as41\nvalues of 1 or 0, respectively. Data were fitted to a logistic regression model based on the42\napproach of Ratkowsky and Ross (1995) in order to determine the growth\/no growth boundaries43\nof the fungi under the assayed environmental factors. The model employed was a second-order44\nlogistic regression model in the form shown in the following equation:45\n2 2 2\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91\nlog ( ) ln w w w w\nP\nit P a a t a T a a a t a T a a a tT a ta a Ta\nP\n\uf0e9 \uf0f9\uf03d \uf03d \uf02b \uf02b \uf02b \uf02b \uf02b \uf02b \uf02b \uf02b \uf02b\uf0ea \uf0fa\uf02d\uf0eb \uf0fb\n(1)1\nwhere, P is the probability of growth (in the range of 0-1), ai are coefficients to be estimated, aw2\nis the water activity of the medium, t (days) is incubation time, and T (\u00b0C) is temperature. The3\nequation was fitted using Minitab\u00ae version 14.1 (Minitab Inc., State College, PA, USA) logistic4\nregression procedure. The automatic variable selection option with a stepwise selection method5\nwas used to choose the significant effects (P<0.05). The predicted growth\/no growth interfaces6\nfor P=0.1, 0.5, and 0.9 were calculated using Microsoft Excel Solver. The following statistical7\nindices were calculated to measure the goodness-of-fit of the developed models: the Hosmer-8\nLemeshow goodness-of-fit statistic, the maximum rescaled R2 and the concordance rate9\n(McKellar and Lu 2001; Koutsoumanis and Sofos 2005; Skandamis et al. 2007).10\n11\nModelling of OTA production12\nFor the same set of aw\/temperature conditions a separate logistic regression model was developed13\nto quantify the effect of both factors on OTA production. For this reason, OTA analysis results14\nwere assigned values of either 1 when OTA concentration was above the limit of detection (>l.d.),15\nor 0 when OTA concentration was below the limit of detection (<l.d.). Logistic regression was16\nused to calculate the probability of OTA production given a certain combination of storage17\nconditions (aw and temperature) and incubation time. A similar second order logistic regression18\nmodel was developed as follows:19\n2 2 2\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91\nlog ( ) ln w w w w\nP\nit P b b t b T b a b t b T b a b tT b ta b Ta\nP\n\uf0e9 \uf0f9\uf03d \uf03d \uf02b \uf02b \uf02b \uf02b \uf02b \uf02b \uf02b \uf02b \uf02b\uf0ea \uf0fa\uf02d\uf0eb \uf0fb\n(2)20\nwhere, P is the probability of OTA production (in the range of 0-1), and bi are coefficients to be21\nestimated. The equation was fitted using Minitab\u00ae version 14.1 (Minitab Inc., State College, PA,22\nUSA) logistic regression procedure. The automatic variable selection option with a stepwise23\nselection method was used to choose the significant effects (P<0.05). The predicted OTA24\ninterfaces for P=0.1, 0.5, and 0.9 were calculated using Microsoft Excel Solver. The goodness-25\nof-fit of the developed model was assessed by the same statistical indices as mentioned above.26\n27\nComparison of the developed models with independent data28\nThe predictions at 50% probability level of models for the two isolates of A. carbonarius were29\ncompared with two literature data sets in which conditions for growth were similar to those used30\nfor the development of the logistic models. Specifically, the first validation data set was that of31\nBell\u00ed et al. (2005) in which the growth and OTA production of eight isolates of A. carbonarius32\nwere monitored on the same synthetic grape juice medium in relation to temperature (15-37\u00b0C)33\nand water activity (0.90-0.99 aw). The second data set was again of Bell\u00ed et al. (2004b) who34\nstudied the effect of water activity (0.90-0.995 aw) and temperature (10-37\u00b0C) on the growth rate35\nof ten isolates of Aspergillus section Nigri from which four were A. carbonarius, on the same36\nsynthetic grape juice medium. In both data sets, the value of 0.99 aw was not included in the37\nvalidation approach as it was outside the initial aw range used in our work for the development of38\nthe probabilistic model. It has to be noted that in both publications the reported growth data are39\nprovided in the form of kinetic parameters (growth rates, mm day-1) and not as incidence40\n(probability) of growth\/no growth. For the purpose of validation, values of 0 or 1 have been41\nassigned by the authors of the present work to validation data for a selected time period of 2042\ndays, where, according to our experience, growth or no growth should have been occurred.43\n44\nResults1\nThe parameter estimates and statistics with the significant effects (P < 0.05) of the logistic2\nregression model for the growth of the two fungal isolates are shown in Tables 1 and 2. The3\ndegree of agreement between predictions and observations was 99.4% concordant and 0.6%4\ndiscordant for A. carbonarius ATHUM 5659 (Table 1) indicating successful data fitting. Overall,5\n5.5% of observed data fell on the \u201cwrong\u201d side of the predicted boundary at a probability level of6\n0.5, from which 4.1% were false positives (i.e. growth predicted when no growth was observed)7\nand 1.5% false negatives (i.e. no growth predicted but growth observed). The goodness-of-fit was8\nalso evaluated by the Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic (\u03c72 =11.98, df = 8, P = 0.152) and the9\nmaximum rescaled R2 (0.845) which proved the good adjustment of the model to the observations.10\nA similar pattern was observed for the other isolate of A. carbonarius ATHUM 5660 (Table 2).11\nIn this case, the concordance of the model was 99.5%, whereas 3.4% and 0.7% of the predictions12\nwere false positive and false negatives, respectively. The Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic and the13\nmaximum rescaled R2 showed high agreement of predicted with observed probability of growth14\nand hence adequate fit of the data.15\nPlots of probability of growth for aw and temperature at 5, 15 and 25 days of incubation16\nare presented in Figures 1 and 2. It is characteristic that the probability plot shifted to lower17\ntemperatures for the same aw level, especially between 5 and 15 days for both fungal isolates. In18\naddition, the probability of growth for A. carbonarius ATHUM 5660 was higher at the lowest aw19\nassayed (0.85) at 15 and 25 days (Fig. 2) indicating that this fungal isolate could be more20\nxerophilic compared with A. carbonarius ATHUM 5659. The predicted growth interfaces with21\nrespect to time at probabilities of 0.1, 0.5 and 0.9, together with the observed growth\/ no growth22\ndata from which the predictions were derived are depicted in Figures 3 and 4 for each isolate.23\nThese graphs are also representative of the low percentage of model disagreement with the24\nexperimental data. No growth was observed at 10\u00b0C and 40\u00b0C, regardless of aw level. As time25\nincreased, the predicted growth interface shifted to lower water activity values for both isolates.26\nThe advancement of the interface was clearer between 5 and 15 days, but from this time onwards27\nlittle change was evident, with the exception of 40\u00b0C and 0.98 aw where slow fungal growth was28\nobserved at 25 days.29\nA probabilistic approach was also employed for OTA production using a full second30\norder logistic regression model for each fungal isolate. The developed models showed high31\nagreement of prediction with observed probability for OTA production, as was evident from the32\nhigh concordance rate (98.9-99.1) and the R2 statistic values (0.832-0.856) (Tables 3 and 4).33\nIncreasing probabilities for OTA were predicted at 15 days, compared to those after 5 days,34\nparticularly at the lower aw levels assayed (0.88-0.94) (Figs. 5 and 6). The lowest probability for35\nOTA production (P = 0.03) was observed at aw 0.85 and 19-20\u00b0C even after 25 days of storage.36\nProbability profiles at 15 and 25 days presented similar patterns with the exception of aw 0.8837\nwhere increased values were estimated for both fungal isolates with respect to time. The38\npredicted OTA interface at probabilities of 0.1, 0.5 and 0.9 is shown in Figures 7 and 8. No OTA39\nwas detected either at 10\u00b0C or at 40\u00b0C regardless of aw. Similarly, no OTA was detected at aw40\n0.85 at the different temperature levels. At 5 days, predictions with P = 0.5 enclosed all OTA41\nproduction cases for A. carbonarius ATHUM 5960 (Fig. 8). The same was not observed for the42\nother isolate as three aw\/temperature conditions were left below the interface line (Fig. 7). With43\nregard to time, the interface shifted to lower aw values and at 25 days the P = 0.5 interface line44\nenclosed all the OTA production cases for both isolates.45\nValidation was carried out with literature data from two independent data sets. In the first1\nliterature study (Bell\u00ed et al. 2005) the logistic model predicted growth in all cases (100%), while2\ngrowth was not actually observed at 0.90 aw and 15\u00b0C for the eight strains of A. carbonarius3\nassayed (Table 5). A similar situation was observed with the second literature study (Bell\u00ed et al.4\n2004) where the model gave three false negative (i.e. no growth predicted when growth was5\nobserved) predictions at 10\u00b0C and 0.95, 0.98 aw (Table 6) for four strains of the fungus examined.6\nPredicted OTA responses from the first literature study are shown in Table 7. There was an7\noverall discordance for 13 aw\/temperature conditions for which the logistic model predicted OTA8\nproduction above the detection limit, while the observed OTA concentration was below the9\ndetection limit. However, all the erroneously predicted cases were on the safe side (fail positive).10\n11\nDiscussion12\nThe present study describes the applicability of a probabilistic modelling approach for the13\ninfluence of aw and temperature on growth and OTA production of two ochratoxigenic isolates of14\nA. carbonarius from Greek wine grapes. Models to predict the likelihood of growth of15\nmicroorganisms as a function of intrinsic and extrinsic factors were first explored in the 1970s16\n(Genigeorgis 1981; Gibson et al. 1987), known as \u201cprobability\u201d models. Later on it became17\nnecessary to manage the risk to consumers from foodborne pathogens and ensure18\npresence\/absence of a certain microorganism in a food commodity, thus leading to the19\ndevelopment of \u201cgrowth\/no growth boundary\u201d or \u201cinterface\u201d modelling (Ratkowsky and Ross20\n1995). In recent years the need for modelling microbial growth limits has been increasingly21\nrecognised (McMeekin et al. 2002). Such models can be useful in the development of processes22\nthat allow production of safer food products and could also be important for deciding food safety23\nregulations (Schaffnet and Labuza 1997). So far predictive mycology has not received the same24\nlevel of attention compared to food-borne pathogenic bacteria and only recently the concepts for25\nmodelling fungal development have been reviewed (Dantigny et al. 2005). Probability models,26\nalthough not extensively used in predictive mycology, can provide useful information and define27\nthe response of the fungus in boundary conditions of growth and toxin production.28\nThe present logistic model was fitted successfully to the experimental data as the agreement29\nbetween observed and predicted probabilities was > 99% concordant for fungal growth (Tables 1-30\n2) and > 98% for OTA production (Tables 3-4) for both isolates. It proved difficult to find31\nappropriate literature data to compare our logistic model as no similar approach has been32\nemployed so far for A. carbonarius in grapes. However, these values are comparable with those33\nreported by Mar\u00edn et al. (2008) for A. carbonarius growth and OTA production in pistachio nuts,34\nwhere the relevant concordant rates were 95.6% (for fungal growth) and 94.6% (for OTA35\nproduction). The maximum rescaled R2 of 0.845\/0.869 (for growth) and 0.832\/0.856 (for OTA)36\nobtained in the present study was higher that that reported in the above mentioned work, i.e.37\n0.786 and 0.715 for growth and OTA production, respectively. The higher values of R2 reported38\nin this work could be explained by the fact that our experiment was carried out on a synthetic and39\nwell-defined laboratory medium, whereas in the other work the fungus was inoculated directly on40\npistachio nuts.41\nWith respect to time, the growth boundary shifted to higher temperature levels (25-30\u00b0C)42\n(Figs. 3-4) whereas the OTA production boundary shifted to lower temperatures (15-25\u00b0C) (Figs.43\n7-8) indicating that OTA production does not occur at its best under the same conditions for44\ngrowth. The extension of the growth boundary with time was similar for the two isolates, with the45\nlowest aw for growth at 0.85-0.88 depending on incubation temperature. Growth at these aw46\nvalues, although not consistent with literature data (Mitchell et al. 2004; Bell\u00ed et al. 2005; Leong1\net al. 2006), could be attributed to adaptation to regional climatic conditions, thus making these2\nisolates more tolerant to xerophilic conditions. As observed in the probability plots (Figs. 1-2),3\nprobabilities of growth over 0.8 were predicted in synthetic grape medium with 0.90-0.98 aw4\nincubated at 15-35\u00b0C in 5 days time. As the aw in grapes during ripening is 0.95-0.98 and the5\nprevailing temperatures at harvest many vary between 30 and 35\u00b0C, or lower depending on6\nregional conditions, there is increased probability of fungal growth and subsequent OTA7\ncontamination. The same probability level (P > 0.8) for OTA production for the same8\ntemperature range and time was attained in growth media with 0.94-0.98 aw for A. carbonarius9\nATHUM 5659 (Fig. 7) and 0.96-0.98 aw for A. carbonarius ATHUM 5660 (Fig. 8), indicating10\nthat the range of aw for OTA production is narrower than that for growth. However, fungal11\ngrowth and OTA production is much more complicated under realistic conditions as reported by12\nMar\u00edn et al. (2006). Environmental fluxes, especially day temperatures may not be appropriate13\nfor OTA production but may support hyphal extension increasing the potential for OTA14\nproduction under lower temperatures at night.15\nValidation with independent literature data showed that the developed logistic model16\ncould adequately predict the growth\/no growth cases of other A. carbonarius strains at a17\nprobability level of 0.5. Some disagreement was only observed with 1 false positive (Table 5)18\nand 3 false negative (Table 6) predictions out of 68 total growth cases. The false negative cases19\nwere not predicted successfully as they were located at the boundaries of the domain of the model.20\nFinally, the model predicted OTA responses reasonably well as the agreement with literature data21\nfor OTA absence was 27 out of 40 (67.5%) cases and 5 out of 5 (100%) cases for OTA presence.22\nThe misclassified cases of the model could be attributed to the great variability of different A.23\ncarbonarius stains in OTA production between countries and also within the same country even24\nunder the same environmental conditions (Mitchell et al. 2004).25\nIn conclusion, the results of this study indicate that logistic regression models can be26\nsuccessfully employed to predict the boundaries for growth and OTA production of A.27\ncarbonarius on a synthetic grape juice medium and also for other mycotoxin producing species.28\nHowever, due to the variability of A. carbonarius strains in growth potential and OTA production,29\nfurther research is needed to develop and validate more extensively such models with additional30\nregional experimental data from grapes and grape products.31\n32\nAcknowledgements33\nThis work was supported by the project \u201cPresence of ochratoxin A in Greek wines and study on34\nthe conditions that influence its production\u201d (project DSVEPRO-90) financed by the General35\nSecretariat for Research and Technology of the Greek Ministry for Development.
