However, recent \ntheoretical and observational studies have demonstrated that photosynthesis is \nalso more efficient under diffuse light conditions\n1-5\n. Changes in cloud cover or \natmospheric aerosol loadings, arising from either volcanic or anthropogenic \nemissions, alter both the total Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) \nreaching the surface and the fraction of this radiation which is diffuse, with \nuncertain overall effects on global plant productivity and the land carbon sink. \nHere we estimate for the first time, the impact of variations in diffuse fraction on \nthe land carbon sink using a global model modified to account for the effects of \nvariations in both direct and diffuse radiation on canopy photosynthesis. We \nestimate that variations in diffuse fraction, associated largely with the \u201cglobal \ndimming\u201d period6-8, enhanced the land carbon sink by approximately a quarter \nfrom 1960 to 1999. However, under a climate mitigation scenario for the 21\nst\n \ncentury in which sulphate aerosols decline before atmospheric CO2 is stabilised, \nthis \u201cdiffuse-radiation\u201d fertilisation effect declines rapidly to near zero by the \nend of the 21\nst\n century.  \n \nThe solar radiation reaching the Earth\u2019s surface is the primary driver of plant photosynthesis. \nLeaf photosynthesis increases non-linearly with incident PAR, saturating at light levels which \nare often exceeded on bright days during the growing season (Fig 1). In clear-sky conditions, a \nfraction of the plant canopy is illuminated by direct solar radiation consisting of bright \n\u201csunflecks\u201d, with the remaining portion of the canopy being in the shade. The sunlit fraction of \nthe canopy has leaves which are often light saturated and therefore have low light use \nefficiency, while leaves in the shade are more light-use efficient but suffer from a lower \nexposure to incoming radiation. In contrast, under cloudy or sulphate-aerosol-laden skies, \nsunlight is more scattered and incoming radiation is more diffuse producing a more uniform \nirradiance of the canopy with a smaller fraction of the canopy likely to be light-saturated. As a \nresult, canopy photosynthesis tends to be significantly more light-use efficient under diffuse \nrather than direct sunlight\n3\n. Hence, the net effect on photosynthesis of radiation changes \nassociated with an increase in clouds or scattering aerosols depends on a balance between the \nreduction in the overall total PAR (which tends to reduce photosynthesis) and the increase in \nthe diffuse fraction of the PAR (which tends to increase photosynthesis). While some global \nclimate-carbon cycle models include the effects of atmospheric aerosols on total irradiance and \nsurface temperature (e.g. ref. 9), none has accounted for the effects of clouds and aerosols on \nthe land carbon sink via changes in the diffuse fraction of radiation.  \n \nTo account for the effects of diffuse radiation on canopy photosynthesis, we modified the \nJULES land surface scheme used in the Hadley Centre climate models\n10\n. JULES includes a \nmultilayer approach to scale photosynthesis from the leaf to the canopy. In this study we also \nseparated each canopy layer into sunlit and shaded regions\n11\n. Figure 1 shows a comparison of \nthe simulated light response of Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) against measurements \ninferred from the eddy correlation technique under direct and diffuse irradiance conditions \nwithin a broadleaf \n12\n and a needleleaf temperate forest \n13\n. The modified JULES model is able to \nreproduce the different light response curves under diffuse and direct radiation within the error \nbars of the observations. A sensitivity analysis carried out for the broadleaf forest shows that \nsimulated GPP reaches a maximum at a diffuse fraction of 0.4 after which GPP decreases due \nto a reduction in the total PAR (Fig S1).The existence of such an optimum is in agreement with \na previous modelling study for the same site\n14\n. \n \nWe performed multiple global simulations with JULES over the period 1901 to 2100 to assess \nthe impact of changing diffuse radiation on the global land carbon sink. For 1901 to 1999, we \nused an observed monthly climatology of the main climate variables\n15\n, except direct and \ndiffuse total shortwave and PAR fluxes which were reconstructed using radiative transfer \ncalculations. The reconstruction takes into account the scattering and absorption of solar \nradiation by tropospheric aerosols as simulated by the Hadley Centre Global Environmental \nModel (version HadGEM2-A)\n16\n, a climatology of stratospheric aerosols\n17\n and a cloudiness \ndataset\n15\n (see methodology). For the period 2000 to 2100 we prescribed varying atmospheric \nCO2 concentration and monthly fields of anthropogenic aerosols, following an A1B 450 ppm \nCO2 equivalent stabilization scenario relying on the A1B storyline and the methodology from \nref. 18. Under this scenario, diffuse fraction increases during the second half of the 20\nth\n century \nand then decreases during the 21\nst\n century due to correspondingly increasing and decreasing \nanthropogenic aerosols emissions (Figs 3a and 4a). The uncertain effects of future changes in \nclimate were not considered so as to isolate the diffuse radiation effect.  \n \nAerosols also have indirect effects on total PAR through modifying cloud properties, although \nthese effects are more uncertain\n19\n .To provide an upper estimate of the impact of the first \nindirect effect (i.e. the effect of aerosols on cloud brightness) on the land biosphere\n20\n we \nassume an absolute reduction in PAR beneath clouds equal to the absolute reduction in clear-\nsky PAR due to aerosols\n19\n. A \u201cfixed diffuse fraction\u201d control simulation was performed by \nprescribing the mean diffuse fraction for each gridbox and month, based on our reconstruction \nof the period 1901-1910. The remaining climatological variables in this simulation (including \ntotal PAR) varied as in the first simulation, enabling us to isolate the effect of the varying \ndiffuse fraction as the difference between these two model runs. (See online methods and \nSupplementary Information for a description of other sensitivity tests undertaken.) \n \nThe eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 provided a natural test of the impact of a large \nincrease in stratospheric aerosol loading on the land carbon cycle. The main climatic \nconsequences of the eruption were a cooling of the surface due to scattering aerosols, and an \nanomalously low growth rate of the atmospheric CO2 concentration in both 1992 and 1993, due \nto an enhanced terrestrial carbon sink\n21,22\n. Several explanations have been proposed to explain \nthis anomalous land sink, including suppression of plant and heterotrophic respiration during \nthe relatively cool summers\n23,24\n and enhanced canopy photosynthesis as a result of the post-\nPinatubo increase in diffuse fraction\n2,3\n. However, the relative contributions of these processes \nduring the post-Pinatubo years of 1992 and 1993, and their spatial distribution, remain \nuncertain. \n \nJULES simulates an anomalous land carbon sink of 1.13 and 1.53 PgC yr\n-1\n during 1992 and \n1993 respectively, in general agreement with the land flux inferred from observations\n22,25\n (Fig. \n2). Our model suggest a major contribution of diffuse radiation to the land sink anomaly in \n1992 of 1.18 PgC yr\n-1\n, but a much smaller contribution in 1993 of 0.04 PgC yr\n-1 \n(red wedge in \nFig 2). Carbon sink anomalies of 1.05 PgC yr\n-1\n and 0.92 PgC yr\n-1\n are associated with the \nanomalously cool air temperatures in 1992 and 1993 (anomalies of -0.33 K and -0.21 K) which \nact to suppress heterotrophic respiration (for further details see Figs. S2-S5).  \n \nA decrease in total solar radiation\n6-8\n has been observed at the Earth\u2019s surface over the 1950-\n1980 period, termed \u201cglobal dimming\u201d. This decrease is consistent with the impacts of \nanthropogenic aerosols on cloud properties, water vapour and cloud feedbacks due to global \nwarming\n26\n. Increases in cloud thickness, cloud cover and scattering aerosols enhance the \ndiffuse component of radiation reaching the surface while increasing absorbing aerosols can \nhave the opposite effect\n27.\n As a result observed trends in diffuse radiation are not as coherent as \nthose in total radiation during the dimming period\n28-30\n. Since the 1980s industrialised regions of \nthe Northern Hemisphere appear to have \u201cbrightened\u201d8, associated with reduced anthropogenic \nemissions of aerosol precursors (especially sulphur dioxide) in these regions.  \n \nFigure 3a shows changes in the diffuse fraction of PAR as reconstructed using cloud cover\n14\n \nand aerosol distributions. The simulated total shortwave radiation and diffuse fraction compare \nwell against ground based radiation measurements (Figs. S6 and S7). The contribution of \nvariations in diffuse fraction to the simulated land carbon sink, becomes important after 1950 \n(Fig. 3b). This contribution increases during the global dimming period (1960-1980) when it \nadds 0.44 PgC yr\n-1\n to the mean land carbon sink, and lessens during the subsequent brightening \nperiod (1980-1999) when it contributes a mean of 0.3 PgC yr\n-1\n, as a result of decreasing diffuse \nfraction.  \n The HadGEM2-A reconstruction suggests geographically varying changes in diffuse fraction of \n-5% to 30% from 1950 to 1980 (Fig. 3c). The corresponding impact on the regional land sink is \nestimated to be large, reaching up to 30 gC m\n-2 \nyr\n-1\n across Europe, Eastern United States, East \nAsia and some tropical regions in Africa (Fig. 3d). In contrast, during the brightening period \n1980-2000 (Fig. S8), the HadGEM2-A reconstruction suggests a reduction in diffuse fraction \nover Europe, Eastern USA, Western Australia and some regions of Russia and China, leading \nto a reduction in the regional contribution of the diffuse fraction to the total land carbon \naccumulation over this period. Overall these results suggest that increases in diffuse fraction \nhave enhanced the global land carbon sink by 23.7% from 1960 to 1999 (Fig. 4b). As shown in \nFig. S9, the contributions of diffuse fraction to the land sink are of similar magnitude to the net \ncontributions of variations in temperature and precipitation over this period.  \n \nNeglecting \u201cdiffuse-radiation fertilization\u201d, as in the current generation of global models, we \nestimate that reductions in total PAR would have caused a -14.4% change in the mean land \ncarbon sink. Instead we model a net enhancement of the land carbon sink by overall (diffuse \nand direct) radiation changes of +9.3%, as diffuse radiation fertilization overwhelms \u201cglobal \ndimming\u201d (see Fig S10 for regional contributions to GPP). Contrary to the results of current \nglobal models, it therefore seems that anthropogenic aerosols have enhanced land carbon \nuptake over this period despite significant reductions in total PAR. Fully coupled Earth system \nmodel simulations are now required to confirm this result when accounting for the effects of \nshort timescale variability in atmospheric aerosol loading. \n \nTo project these results into the 21\nst\n century an environmentally friendly emissions scenario \n(ENSEMBLES A1B-450) was assumed, in which total greenhouse gas concentrations stabilize \nat 450 ppmv CO2 equivalent, and sulphate and black carbon aerosol emissions decline rapidly. \nUnder this scenario atmospheric carbon dioxide peaks at 435 ppmv around 2050 before \ndeclining steadily to reach 421 ppmv by 2100. The total aerosol optical depth declines steeply \nfrom its 2000 maximum of 0.12 and levels off at 0.10 by 2050 (Fig. 4a). As a result, the \nHadGEM2-A reconstruction suggests a rapid reduction in the diffuse fraction of PAR, which \nleads to a rapid decline in the contribution of diffuse radiation to the land carbon sink. By 2100, \ndiffuse-radiation fertilization is lost (Fig. 4b). We conclude that steeper cuts in fossil fuel \nemissions will be required to stabilize the climate if anthropogenic aerosols decline as \nexpected.  \n \nMethods Summary \nThis study uses the JULES land surface scheme\n10\n which takes into account variations of direct \nand diffuse radiation on sunlit and shaded canopy photosynthesis. We added a description of \nsunfleck penetration through the canopy\n11\n and separated each layer of the canopy into sunlit \nand shaded regions. In this way, photosynthesis of sunlit and shaded leaves is calculated \nseparately assuming that shaded leaves receive only diffuse light and sunlit leaves receive both \ndiffuse and direct radiation.  \n \nThe geographical distributions of the downward direct and diffuse radiative fluxes throughout \nthe 20\nth\n and 21\nst\n centuries were obtained by coupling distributions of clouds and aerosols \n(tropospheric and stratospheric\n17\n) using look-up tables of radiative transfer calculations. \nDistributions of aerosol optical depths (AOD) at 0.55 \u00b5m for six tropospheric aerosol species \nfor the 20\nth\n century were taken from simulations of HadGEM2-A, the atmospheric version of \nthe latest Hadley Centre Global Environmental Model. AOD distributions for sulphate and \nblack-carbon in the 21\nst\n century were obtained by scaling the distributions for the year 2000 \naccording to changes in ammonium sulphate burden obtained using the ENSEMBLES A1B \n450 scenario relying on the A1B storyline and the methodology from ref. 18. The four other \ntropospheric aerosol species, and stratospheric aerosols, were left unchanged at their 2000 \nlevels because their future evolutions are uncertain. \n \nThis study uses the 0.5\no\n resolution observed monthly climatology\n15\n.All monthly data were \nregridded onto a 2.75\no\n x 3.75\no\n grid and disaggregated to hourly data. Future climate change for \nthe 21\nst\n century was not considered, and climate variables, including cloud cover, were taken as \nfixed at their year 1999 values throughout the 21\nst\n century simulation. \n \nIn each case percentage changes in the land carbon sink are calculated relative to our \u201cfixed \ndiffuse fraction\u201d control simulation. \n \nReferences \n1\n Goudriaan, J.

Observed and modelled light \nresponse of Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) to both direct and diffuse PAR (open triangle \nand closed circles, respectively) averaged over 200 mol quanta m\n-2\n s\n-1\n bins. For the purposes \nof this validation data points are split into \u201cdiffuse\u201d and \u201cdirect\u201d conditions, using diffuse \nfractions of greater than 80% and less than 25% to discriminate these two cases. Measurements \ninferred from eddy correlation are given in black (error bars represent one standard deviation), \nand simulations are given in pink (see methods). The left-hand panel represents measurements \nand simulations for a broadleaf forest site, and the right-hand panel is for a needleleaf forest \nsite. \n \nFigure 2.

Also presented are \nsimulated global detrended flux anomalies of NEE (black) under varying (continuous line) and \nfixed (dashed line) diffuse fraction.

Simulated contribution of diffuse fraction variations (red shadow) to the \ncumulative land carbon sink (black line) over the 1900-2100 period. In this scenario, future \nclimate change for the 21\nst\n century was not considered, and climate variables, including cloud \ncover, were taken as fixed at their year 1999 values throughout the 21\nst\n century simulation. \nMethods \n \nShortwave and PAR fields. Geographical distributions of the downward direct and diffuse \nradiative fluxes throughout the 20\nth\n and 21\nst\n centuries were obtained using look-up tables of \nradiative transfer calculations driven by distributions of clouds and aerosols. Aerosol \ndistributions were simulated by the atmospheric component of the Hadley Centre Global \nEnvironmental Model version 2 (HadGEM2-A)\n16\n, which includes six tropospheric aerosol \nspecies (sulphate, black-carbon, mineral dust, sea-salt and biomass-burning). Model evaluation \nagainst ground-based Sun-photometer measurements shows model underestimation of AOD \nover Europe and North America in winter and north-western Africa during mineral dust and \nbiomass-burning events. However, simulations are good during summer and throughout the \nyear in Asia, southern Africa, and South America\n16\n. \n \nChanges in aerosol optical depth throughout the 20\nth\n century were obtained by varying \nemissions of aerosols and their precursors. Distributions of tropospheric aerosol optical depths \nfor the six aerosol species were provided at a resolution of 1.25\u00ba latitude by 1.875\u00ba longitude as \nmonthly means every ten years from 1900 to 1980, and every five years from 1980 to 2000. \nMonthly distributions for the years in between were linearly interpolated from the modelled \ndistributions. Distributions of stratospheric aerosols from the 20\nth\n century were taken as zonal \nmeans from ref. 17. \n \nAerosol optical depth distributions for sulphate and black-carbon in the 21\nst\n century were \nobtained by scaling the distributions for the year 2000 according to changes in the ammonium \nsulphate burden simulated by a chemistry-climate model using the ENSEMBLES A1B 450 \nscenario relying on the A1B storyline and the methodology from ref. 18. The four other \ntropospheric aerosol species, and stratospheric aerosols, were left unchanged at their 2000 \nlevels, as their future evolution is uncertain. \n \nRadiative transfer calculations. Downward direct and diffuse radiative fluxes were obtained \nindependently for the clear-sky (cloud-free) and cloudy part of each gridbox. These fluxes were \npre-computed and stored in look-up tables for the shortwave (0.28 to 4.0 \u00b5m) and PAR (0.40 to \n0.69 \u00b5m) spectra. \n \nIn clear-sky conditions, downward direct and diffuse radiative fluxes depend on the solar zenith \nangle, the type and optical depth of the tropospheric aerosol, and the optical depth of the \nstratospheric aerosol. Aerosol phase function and scattering and absorption coefficients were \ncomputed for all aerosol species at 24 wavelengths using Mie calculations. The computed \naerosol optical properties were used in a discrete-ordinate solver\n31\n to obtain radiative fluxes. \nTropospheric aerosols were assumed to be homogeneously distributed across the lowest \nkilometre of the atmosphere, while stratospheric aerosols reside in a homogeneous layer \nbetween 15 and 20 km.  \n \nIn cloudy sky conditions, the cloud type and optical thickness were not given by the Climate \nResearch Unit dataset (CRU)\n15\n. The only characterisation of clouds in the CRU dataset is their \nfractional cover, which contains little information to determine downward shortwave and PAR \nfluxes. To circumvent this issue, quadratic relationships between cloud cover and atmospheric \ntransmission were derived from simulations by HadGEM2-A over each continent, on a monthly \nbasis. Here, the atmospheric transmission is the ratio between the downward shortwave flux at \nthe surface and the incoming shortwave flux at the top of the atmosphere. Using this ratio, the \ndiurnal cycle of incoming shortwave flux was imposed on the downward flux at the surface. \nThese relationships thus provided a means of reproducing the monthly-averaged downward \nflux simulated by the climate model but using the observed CRU cloud cover dataset as an \ninput. The downward flux in the cloudy fraction of a gridbox was assumed to be purely diffuse, \nwhich is a good approximation except at very low cloud optical depth. Fluxes in the PAR \nspectral bands were obtained by assuming that cloud extinction was constant throughout the \nshortwave spectrum. Under this assumption, PAR fluxes are 41% of shortwave fluxes. A \ncomparison of simulated total shortwave flux and diffuse fraction against ground based \nobservations (Fig S6 and S7), allowed us to adjust the cloudy-sky flux look-up table, with a \nreduction of 25% of the fluxes in order to retain the set of parameters that fit best the observed \nfluxes. \n \nThe clear-sky flux in a given grid-box at a given time and date was obtained from the look-up \ntable record corresponding to the current solar zenith angle, and tropospheric and stratospheric \naerosol optical depths. Since look-up tables did not include combinations of different \ntropospheric aerosol types, the whole tropospheric column was assumed to have the optical \nproperties of the dominant aerosol. Look-up table fluxes were linearly interpolated in solar \nzenith angle and tropospheric aerosol optical depth. The reconstructed clear-sky surface fluxes \ncompared very well against those computed in HadGEM2-A. The cloudy-sky flux was derived \nfrom the value of the cloud cover in the grid-box, while the solar zenith angle determined the \nincoming solar radiation. Finally, cloudy- and clear-sky fluxes were weighted by the cloud \ncover and the clear-sky fractions, respectively, to obtain the grid-box averaged downward \ndirect and diffuse fluxes in the shortwave and PAR spectra. \n \nJULES evaluation at single sites. Evaluation of JULES was carried-out using hourly values of \neddy correlation flux data and meteorology from two german sites: a temperate broadleaf forest \nsite (Hainich)\n12\n and a temperate needleleaf forest site (Wetzstein)\n13 \nduring the summer. \nMeteorological forcing and diffuse radiation measured in parallel with the eddy correlation \nfluxes were used to force the model. To evaluate the global model at individual flux sites we \ncalibrated model parameters to fit local ecological conditions. In particular, the model \nparameter that represents the maximum photosynthetic capacity, Vmax was set at 60 \nand 40 mol m\n-2\n s\n-1\n for the broadleaf and needleleaf sites respectively. The corresponding \nvalues used in the global model were 32 and 24 mol m\n-2\n s\n-1\n. \n \nVegetation cover was updated using the TRIFFID dynamic global vegetation model, which \nincludes a rudimentary model of leaf phenology based on growing degree days. Changes in \nland-use were neglected, instead a fixed land-use mask was prescribed to account for present-\nday crop and pasture lands. \n \n31 J. R. Key & Schweiger, A. J.
