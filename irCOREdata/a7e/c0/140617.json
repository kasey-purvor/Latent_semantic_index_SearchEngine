We have moved from a cost-centred approach in the mid-1970s,3\nthrough the technology feasibility studies of the mid-1980s, the risk-based approaches of the4\nmid-1990s and into a new millennium where environmental decisions must be \u201csocially-5\nrobust\u201d within a context of sustainable development (Urban Task Force, 1999; ESRC Global6\nEnvironmental Change Programme, 2000). These decades represent our efforts to ensure7\nregeneration is affordable, feasible, effective and latterly, sustainable. Now, and as a result of8\nour acquired understanding, successful management of land contamination whether at the9\nsite, regional or national scale relies on applying a large and multidisciplinary knowledge10\nbase that straddles the natural, physical, engineering and social sciences within a practical,11\ncommercial, regulatory and often community context (Pollard et al., 2001a).12\nDecision-makers must not only be able to synthesise and apply this knowledge but also13\nwork in a modern decision-making environment with an emphasis on \u2018process\u2019, wider14\nparticipation and deliberation. A decade ago, Renn (1992) voiced the need for \u201ca (decision)15\nprocess that facilitates the involvement of all affected parties and at the same time produces a16\nprudent and informed judgement based on expertise and knowledge\u201d as one of the major17\nchallenges of a modern democratic society. The success of such a process, whether for18\ndecisions on land contamination or other environmental pressures, depends on time,19\nopenness, the equal position of all parties and a willingness to learn. Socially robust20\ndecisions make the presumption of access to resources, flexibility in the decision-making21\nprocess and an inherent capacity and desire for change (Homan et al., 2001; Brookes et al.,22\n2001).23\nThe new expectations of stakeholders including the public are there to see. There is24\ngrowing public interest in, and engagement with, the process of decision-making, an25\n3increasing expectation of access to the technical documents and judgements of technical1\nexperts that support decisions on risk, and increased public scrutiny of the risk work of2\ncompanies, their professional advisors and of the regulators (House of Lords Select3\nCommittee on Science and Technology, 2000; Green Alliance, 2000). Stakeholders and4\npublics wish to understand and influence decision-making processes and their outcomes5\n(Fischer, 1993; ESRC Global Environmental Change Programme, 2000). The response6\nrequired of decision-makers is to make judgements transparent, explicit and open for7\nchallenge and to be clear about where those opportunities exist in the decision-making8\nprocess (ILGRA, 1998; Petts, 2000).9\n10\nMaking decisions about land contamination11\nDecision-makers managing land contamination in the new millennium face complex issues of12\nfinancial liability, securing development funding, the management of a series of regulatory13\ninterfaces, of interpreting sophisticated analytical data and risk assessments, the relative14\ncapabilities of remediation technologies and the maintenance of public confidence in15\nremediation projects - all of which impact on the decision process and outcome (Vegter et al.,16\n2002; Pollard and Earl, 2003). Other than for large-scale regeneration projects that progress17\nover 5-10 years, the application of integrated frameworks that consider environmental, social18\nand economic factors (Stern and Fineberg, 1996; Presidential \/ Congressional Commission,19\n1997; van der Vorst et al., 1999) may be hard to justify. Most projects require fast20\nturnaround, development-led decisions, often with little capacity for the revisiting of data and21\ntiered approaches to chemical analysis and risk assessment. Short timescales force a linear22\napproach to taking decisions and there is pressure to reach decisions quickly. Acknowledging23\nthe practical and developing needs of risk management, governments, research organisations24\nand industry bodies have developed practical guidance for decision-makers on negotiating the25\n4maze of factors influencing land contamination decisions (CONCAWE, 1997; ASTM, 1995;1\n2001; Environment Agency, 2003). But how, having acknowledged the complexity of the2\ndecision making context, do we apply integrated decision-making in practice? Here we3\nexplore some of the decision tools available beyond the well-referenced technique of risk4\nassessment and, in the context of land contamination, explore the practical challenges for5\nintegrating these tools within the decision frameworks that are beginning to emerge.6\n7\nSustainable Development, Decision-Making and Land Contamination8\nThe UK strategy for sustainable development (Cm 4345, 1999), which has as its aim9\nestablishing a better quality of life for present and future generations, has the key objectives10\nof (i) social progress which recognises the need of everyone (equity within and between11\ngenerations); (ii) effective protection of the environment (proactive approach to limiting12\nenvironmental damage); (iii) prudent use of natural resources (clean and efficient use of non-13\nrenewable and renewable resources); and (iv) maintenance of high and stable levels of14\neconomic growth and employment (improved living standards for all; quality goods and15\nservices; education and skills). Application of the sustainable development agenda to soil16\nquality (Puri and Gordon, 1998; DETR 2000; Defra, 2001) is focussing on historic land17\ncontamination and the wider aspects of soil quality, including (progressing from from aim,18\nthrough application to evaluation): (i) bringing land back into early beneficial use; (ii)19\nreducing pressure on greenfield sites and the pollution of groundwater, thus conserving20\nagricultural land and natural habitats; (iii) adoption of a suitable-for-use approach towards21\nland remediation; (iv) the efficient use of national resources to tackle issues of highest risk at22\npriority sites; (v) prioritising remedial action so as to address the worst risks first in relation to23\nthe use of the land concerned; (vi) the application of sustainable remediation technologies24\nthat conserve land and resources; (vii) development and maintenance of new partnerships and25\n5fora among key stakeholders with agreements on a common research and practice agenda;1\n(viii) the consideration of point and diffuse sources of soil pollution over the long term; (ix)2\nthe development of monitoring systems that allow early detection of adverse soil, water and3\necosystems changes; and (x) the distribution of impacts from land contamination on4\ncommunities. In the UK, these issues are being addressed through a combination of policy,5\nregulatory, voluntary and technological responses, supported in turn by the application of6\ndecision tools at the strategic and operational level.7\nEnvironmental regulators and land-use planners have at their disposal a considerable8\narray of tools (Table 1) to assist with screening environmental impacts, assessing risk \/9\nbenefit trade-offs, engaging wider stakeholder communities within decision-making and the10\nintegration of technical, socio-political and economic factors that inform environmental11\ndecisions (e.g DETR, 1998; RCEP, 1998; Sexton et al., 1999; USEPA, 1999, Alker et al.,12\n2000). These tools are not only used increasingly at the strategic (policy and programme) and13\noperational (plan and project) levels (Figure 1) but across a wide spectrum of environmental14\nissues (DETR, 1998; Nijboer, 1998; USEPA, 1999; Brookes et al., 2001). At the heart of the15\ntechnical assessment, practitioners have developed frameworks making use of the well-16\nestablished processes of risk assessment, management and communication (Ferguson et al.,17\n1998). However, many of these processes have developed rather in isolation of each other18\nand often without a clear reference to the decision being taken.19\nCurrent approaches to the management of risks from land contamination have much in20\ncommon with many modern environmental decisions that demand an holistic approach.21\nIncreasingly, national and international reports (USEPA, 2001; Vegter, 2002; Environment22\nAgency, 2003) encourage practitioners to connect these aspects of decision-making within an23\noverarching philosophy of risk-based land management (RBLM) and adopt a broader range of24\n6support tools (Assmuth, 1998; ; Bardos, 1999; Earl and Kearney, 2000; Pollard et al., 2001b;1\nPollard and Earl, 2003; Table 1) including:2\n\uf0b7 brainstorming techniques (e.g. for project risk assessment, hazard identification and3\nconceptual model development);4\n\uf0b7 statistical data analysis (e.g. in geotechnical and geoenvironmental site investigation);5\nenvironmental fate and transport modelling (as a component of exposure assessment);6\n\uf0b7 scoping, screening and prioritisation techniques (in qualitative risk assessment; in7\nremedial technology selection);8\n\uf0b7 sensitivity and uncertainty analysis (in quantitative risk assessment);9\n\uf0b7 public consultation workshops;10\n\uf0b7 economic appraisal of costs and benefit (in comparing remedial approaches, including the11\ncosts of \u2018do nothing\u2019 and the assessment of appropriate times for intervention); and12\n\uf0b7 the collection of opinions and lay-perspectives on risk (for risk communication and13\ndecision making).14\n15\n16\nFig. 1 Decision-making at different scales: from policy to project level assessment with17\nexamples of various contexts for land contamination.18\n19\npolicies\nprogrammes\nplans\nprojects\nStrategies: government strategies; new\nlegislation; policy implementation and\nregulation\nregional economic strategies; coalfields programmes;\nremediation of major land portfolios\nmulti-site regeneration; local authority\nregeneration plans; local authority inspection\nstrategies and targeted inspection of areas\nindividual site developments; remediation\nof individual problem sites\nSocial, economic, environmental, natural resource factors\n7This challenge to practitioners to widen their perspective and embrace increasingly formal1\nand integrated tools comes at a time where achieving the balance of economic, social and2\nenvironmental benefits of dealing with land contamination is increasingly critical at all levels3\nof delivery. Money is in short supply, societal pressures, particularly in relation to land use4\nand development density, are increasing and predictions about the long term quality of human5\nhealth and the environment are if anything, increasingly uncertain.6\nDecisions about different aspects taken in isolation are no longer sufficient. The7\nregeneration of brownfield land offers a good example of the need for robust and integrated8\ndecision making. The drivers for regeneration have traditionally been economic, leading to a9\ndemand for simplified assessment of risk with minimum costs of requirements to deal with10\nrisks. At a political level, the new drivers are often social, but this can equally lead to biased11\nviews about the benefits of remediation in relation to the use of the land, or a narrow targeting12\nof remediation on particular areas where there is immediate demand for new uses of land. At13\na wider level however, there is a need to provide a higher overall quality of life, sustainable14\nwater resource management and biodiversity, without simply transferring the problem to15\nanother environmental medium, geographical location or generation. This means that long16\nterm health and environmental risk assessment have to be at the heart of regeneration17\ndecisions, rather than simply one of the processes that takes place to deliver prejudged18\noutcomes.19\n20\n8Table 1: Broad typology of decision tools for environmental decision-makers with application to land contamination (after Pollard et al., 2001b)1\nTool Use Environmental arena in which tool has been\nconventionally applied\nLand contamination decision context\nEnvironmental\nrisk assessment\nEstimation of probability and\nconsequence, usually for adverse\nenvironmental impacts at the site-\nspecific level, but can be applied at\npolicy level as strategic risk\nassessment (SRA).\nChemical product licensing, manufacture and\nuse; production plant safety; environmental\nhealth protection; environmental planning and\nenvironmental permitting; flood defence; liability\nauditing; contaminated land assessment; policy\nanalysis; strategy setting.\nContext well established; identification and\nanalysis of hazards and potential environmental\nharm from contaminated sites; use of\nprobabilistic techniques for dealing with\nuncertainties in exposure assessment; sensitivity\nanalysis to assist in remedial technology\nselection; increasing focus on dose-response\nassessment and ecological risk assessments.\nEnvironmental\n(impact)\nassessment\nEnvironmental, impacts of proposed\ndevelopments; summarised in non-\ntechnical language; participatory\napproach advocated; can also be\napplied at the policy or sectoral level\nas strategic environmental assessment\n(SEA).\nEnvironmental development planning; siting of\ncontentious installations (e.g. incinerators,\nlandfills, tidal barrage); policy analysis; business\nsector analysis.

Increasing interest in participatory\ndecision-making for contaminated land rather\nthan risk communication as a \u2018bolt-on\u2019 on project\ncompletion.\n2\n11\nRisk and economic appraisal: an example of integration1\nOne component of the appraisal of sustainable remediation, economic appraisal, brings new2\nconsiderations to the decision-making process (Martin et al., 1998; Environment Agency,3\n2000a) such as issues of market failure, \u201copportunity costs\u201d, the law of diminishing returns4\nand the \u201cvaluation of impacts\u201d. The purpose of an economic appraisal is not only to estimate5\nthe level of the costs and benefits of the options for risk management, but also to identify the6\nkey factors determining them so as to seek out and refine better options for all concerned with7\nlower costs and greater environmental and social benefits. Economic appraisal relies on the8\nfindings of the risk assessment.9\nFor regulatory authorities considering the remediation of orphan sites, an appraisal might10\ntypically involve determining whether statutory requirements or other remediation aims or11\nobjectives set by an overarching authority exist, for example, by the Department for12\nEnvironment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister13\n(ODPM) or the European Commission (EC). Statutory requirements may stipulate some14\nqualitative caveats regarding the stringency with which agencies should apply them such as15\n\u2018unless excessively costly\u2019 or \u2018unless there are overriding public interests\u2019. In such cases the16\nanalysis would have to consider how these qualitative caveats are translated into the decision17\nprocess. For example, under Part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 in England18\nand Wales (DETR, 2000), the main aim for remediation is to ensure that a significant19\npollutant linkage no longer exists, to the extent that this can be achieved using the best20\ncombination of practicability, effectiveness and durability that is reasonable with regard to the21\nbalance of costs and benefits and by reference to the seriousness of the risk.22\nTaking into account any pre-set remediation objectives and other regulatory or policy23\nconstraints, the full range of objectives that are theoretically possible, and at least practically24\nfeasible, should be identified. This should consider alternatives for the timing of remediation.25\n12\nFor example, in land restoration programmes, remediation may have as its aims not only the1\nremoval of a significant pollutant linkage in relation to Part IIA (DETR, 2000), but also in the2\nlong term the return of the land to a different beneficial use.3\nIt is then necessary to integrate the economic impacts with the environmental, economic4\nand social impacts of the different remediation objectives to determine the most appropriate5\naim of remediation of the site. The appraisal should include the costs of the options and their6\nenvironmental impacts (both positive and negative) and consider impacts assessed in7\nmonetary terms (e.g. impacts on local properties) and intangible impacts (e.g. on human8\nhealth and ecosystems). In situations where more than one option is necessary, it may be9\ncost-effective and practicable to consider the integration of the options into an overall10\nstrategy. The appraisal should set out as fully as possible the level, nature and significance of11\nthese impacts building on scientific assessments of the overall reduction in the environmental12\nimpact that the remediation provides. Such assessments might be encouraged to include the13\nsocial benefits of remediation such as increased amenity value.14\nFinally, the law of diminishing returns reflects the reality that the trade offs between15\nreducing environmental damage and the costs of this reduction become more significant as16\nremediation progresses (Earl and Kearney, 2000; Environment Agency, 2000b). This has17\nsignificant implications for the economic appraisal of remediation options.18\n19\nIntegration in Practice20\nAccounting for a multitude of decision factors generates considerable challenges for decision-21\nmakers including the effectiveness, practicability and cost of implementing integrated22\napproaches and the inevitable issues of terminology (Table 2).23\nWith respect the effectiveness of integrated decisions, one might ask whether24\nstructured approaches to decision-making provide for greater decision-making power and25\n13\nbetter decisions. Pragmatists often argue that the incremental costs associated with the1\nenvironmental appraisal of remediation projects are rarely justified when viewed in terms of2\nthe final outcome, which may have been arrived at through professional judgement without3\nrecourse to a particularly structured analysis. However, structured analysis, which does not4\nneed to override professional judgement, does improve consistency and offer a transparency5\nof approach, providing the aims and boundaries of the assessment (risk assessment, options6\nappraisal) are clearly set out. A further response is to view not only the cost-effectiveness but7\nalso the uptake of a decision by stakeholders (including the risk takers) as a critical indicator8\nof success (Brookes et al., 2001).9\nPracticability is important if the credibility of decision tools is to be upheld. Option10\nappraisal tools should be integral to the decision-making process and practised iteratively.11\nApplication of these tools need not be onerous (Brookes et al., 2001). Many appraisals can12\nbe completed using inexpensive, but transparent screening techniques (rapid appraisal) with13\nmore sophisticated tools (technical appraisal) being reserved for contentious, complex, or14\nhigher priority projects. Screening is an accepted methodology in environmental impact15\nassessment and is becoming recognised (in the UK) as a means of targeting resources at the16\nmost deserving issues at more strategic levels. Checklist approaches, although with17\nrecognised limitations, have been used widely. The approach is analogous to the18\nGovernment\u2019s tiered approach to environmental risk management (DETR et al., 2000; Defra,19\n2002; Figure 2) and has been adopted for land affected by contamination in the Environment20\nAgency\u2019s model procedures for the management of land contamination (Environment21\nAgency, 2003). Many appraisals have core (fixed) and non-core (variable) aspects to their22\nanalysis and decision-makers can streamline their appraisal efforts accordingly by identifying23\ncore issues at a screening stage and focusing any additional effort on decision-critical aspects24\nof the analysis.25\n14\nTable 2: Integrating decision-support tools: some key challenges1\nChallenge General commentary Land contamination decision context\nIdentifying the full\naspects of a problem\nTime needs to be invested at the outset to determine all these\naspects. For example, there may be a mix of traditional EIA issues,\nrisk and potential social and economic impacts. Application of\nbrainstorming and \u2018risk register\u2019 techniques may help. Wide\nconsideration of stakeholder views needed. Key practical challenge\nis of how to include all diverse impacts, aspects and considerations\nof a problem in a systematic manner without \u2018double-counting\u2019.\nEmphasis is usually on scoping out technical detail and conceptual\nmodel development, but often less emphasis on economic and\nsocial aspects of remedial programmes at the outset. Less the case\nfor land regeneration subject to strategic assessment under the\nauspices of, for example, a local or regional plan. Need for site\nwork to be risk-led and risk-based when dealing with historic land\ncontamination.\nSetting boundaries\nfor the analysis\nThese need to be established and agreed both for consistency and\nfor transparency and to make the appraisal practical. For example,\nthere is a growing interest in EIA approaches encapsulating the\nentire life cycle of a project, ranging from the winning of raw\nmaterials to the final decommissioning and disposal stages. But\nthere is a danger of becoming overwhelmed in excessive and\nunnecessary detail, so the analysis should concentrate on issues of\nsignificance to the environmental, economic and social impacts.\nTend to be established by regulatory context and owner \/\ndeveloper. Often technically, or financially driven with less\nemphasis on social issues. Greater consideration and involvement\nof the range of audiences earlier on may help avoid difficulties\nlater with respect to disagreements over the scope of studies, the\ncommunication of risk assessment output and remedial technology\nselection, though not a guarantee against disagreement.\nSelecting individual\ntechniques to\npotentially solve a\nproblem\nIt is difficult to find off-the-peg techniques that are scientifically,\nprofessionally and socially acceptable. There is a dearth of\nguidance. At present a wide range of methods exist from formal\nframeworks such as Risk Assessment, EIA and CBA to deliberative\napproaches. Any single problem may require unique or novel\napproaches tailored to the case in question, or adaptation of an\nexisting decision-making tool. This can take time in the short run,\nbut can avoid significant problems at a later stage.\nMost decision tools require tailoring to the specific circumstances\nof the site because the context of application often requires an\nemphasis on certain aspects. An obvious example is the emphasis\nput on exposure assessment within the application of risk\nassessment for land contamination. This may require adjustment\nto site-specific circumstances with the input of local knowledge\nand data on exposure scenarios.\nMaintaining\nprofessional rigour\nwhilst working in a\nmultidiscipline\nfashion to integrate\ntechniques\nIt is essential to apply rigorous professional standards in each\ndiscipline\u2019s contribution, while still enabling their combination for\nthe development of integrated techniques.\nClear specification of the impacts of remediation option across\ndisciplines (technical, economic, social), without double counting,\nduring appraisal. Recognition of the need for multidiscipline\nteams and recognition of limitations regarding the boundaries of\nprofessional knowledge (engineering; analytical chemistry etc.)\n2\n3\n15\nTable 2 cont\u2019d: Integrating decision-support tools: some key challenges1\nChallenge General commentary Land contamination decision context\nLinking tools and\ntechniques together\nas appropriate\nThis is difficult because of the specific boundaries that surround\ntechniques and the form in which each technique produces its\nfindings. For example, risk assessment may report on the\nsignificance of a contaminant exceeding a threshold, whereas\noptions appraisal techniques also need an analysis of risk reduction\nand residual risk to allow decisions to be made. Often it will be\nnecessary to combine qualitative and quantitative information.\nFurthermore, models on which techniques are based may be\nincompatible.\nClearest example is of using risk assessment output to inform\nremedial objectives. These processes still often viewed as\ndistinct, however. There is a greater need to practice early\niteration of risk management decisions following screening level\nrisk assessments, so as to refine detailed risk assessment work.\nAppropriate\nterminology to avoid\nmisinterpretation of\nkey terms and jargon\nThe above challenges are compounded by differences in the\nlanguage and jargon customarily used by different disciplines and\nthe interpretations attached to specific terms. Differences in\nunderstanding between and within disciplines, between stakeholders\nneed to be addressed early on.\nA common problem across the field of risk. Terminological\ndifferences can be overcome by focusing attention on the\nfundamental questions for which answers are sought. For\nexample: hazard identification \u2013 what hazards are present on site?\nHow might the consequences be realised? Who or what is at risk\nfrom these consequences? etc.\nNon-dominance No single technique or discipline must dominate the others or be\nperceived as dominating in reaching a final decision.\nHistorically, cost has dictated remedial selection. Structured,\nintegrated analysis may result in challenges to the way that this is\npresented. Multidiscipline approach means a range of factors are\nseen as valid, though not necessarily to an equal degree.\nConsideration of\nincreased public\ninvolvement\nCurrent calls for increased public participation. There is\nconsiderable experience in EIA but less so in risk assessment, CBA\nor technology assessment. Structured and focused approaches are\nnecessary, together with an examination of institutional structures\nand their capacity for meaningful public involvement. Monitoring\nand validation of these mechanisms is critical.\nIncreasing interest in risk assessment design and output.\nApproach to date has been on technical risk assessment followed\nby \u2018risk communication\u2019 exercises to discuss output. US\nexperience suggests limited success in this regard and many\ncommentators now point to a need to apply engagement and\nparticipatory approaches. UK experience suggests the earlier this\nis done the better.\nConsidering values Deliberation is one way of uncovering people\u2019s values, but there are\nchallenges as to how those values are incorporated into decision-\nmaking and how representative groups are, such that deliberative\nanalysis of small groups views may need to be supplemented by\nsurveys of a larger sample of the relevant population.\nLikely to have a complex range of values associated with a\ncontaminated site. Potential for inadvertent scientific and\nprofessional bias in risk assessments; consideration of broader\nstakeholder values with respect to remedial objectives. Early\ndiscussion of varied agendas is important.\nRisk perceptions and\nlay epidemiology\nUnderstanding the perspectives from which lay people address\nproblems and valuing their local knowledge - challenge as to how\nlocal knowledge sits alongside expert knowledge.\nLocal effects attributed to sites by individuals \/ communities.\nDifficulties of establishing causality and reconciling reported\nobservations alongside exposure assessments.\n16\nTable 2 cont\u2019d: Integrating decision-support tools: some key challenges1\nChallenge General commentary Land contamination decision context\nHandling uncertainty Recognition that in addition to uncertainty, there may be areas of\nignorance where, in the presence of significant risk, the\nprecautionary principle may be appropriate. To reflect the\nprevailing uncertainties results of appraisals need to be shown as\nranges rather than discrete numbers. Uncertainty and sensitivity\nanalysis can assist in highlighting the significance of ranges.\nIntegral to most environmental decision-making tools. Issues of\nblight and financial risk ensure this is problematic for most\ncontaminated sites. Emphasis on quality assurance and control\nwith respect to consulting advice, site investigation design and\npractice and remedial monitoring. Often an over cautious\napproach is adopted to overcome uncertainty.\nUsing experts The appraisal community is now taking on board participatory\nmethods, combining scientists and non-experts. This raises\nimportant challenges and methods of eliciting and sharing technical\ninformation need to be developed and interrogated.\nUse of experts at public inquiry especially with respect to\nremedial design and exposure assessments. Issues with respect to\nhuman health effects and toxicological data are difficult and tend\nto be addressed with reference to the deliberations of authoritative\nexpert panels and committees. Application of expert elicitation\ntechniques is common place in radioactive performance\nassessment for elicitation of receptor characteristics and\nrepresentative \u2018futures\u2019.\nDeciding which\ntimescale is\nappropriate\nFor example, sustainable development requires a longer-term\nperspective to be taken. There may be a need to undertake\n\u2018scenario-building\u2019 in parallel with a particular appraisal technique.\nIssues of deciding when to intervene, for example, with respect to\nplume transport towards a public water supply. Balancing times\nrequired for detailed assessment alongside plume advancement.\nUse of \u2018what-if\u2019 scenarios and futures to compare decisions.\nTrading-off one\noption against\nanother\nThere are particular challenges regarding how to present\ninformation on the trade-offs concerning risk management options.\nThis also raises issues surrounding the choice of decision factors,\nthe use of ranking, rating or scaling and, more controversially,\nweightings.\nChallenges are particularly difficult where there is considerable\nuncertainty in the component parts of the decision. Issue of\ncomparing quantitative and qualitative information is heightened.\nPost-project analysis It is imperative that the process is evaluated and lessons learned. Improved project design and decision-making processes.\n2\n17\n1\nFig. 2 Example framework for environmental risk management illustrating a tiered2\napproach, iteration and early opportunities (\uf052) to progress to risk management after3\nrapid ( in this case, risk) appraisal.(after DETR, Environment Agency and IEH, 2000)4\n5\nDecision-makers applying these frameworks find themselves responding to the6\nexpectations of a variety of stakeholders, many of whom have interests focused both on7\nand beyond the technical analysis (Fischer, 1993; Homan et al., 2001; Petts et al.,8\n2003a, b). The multiple terminologies of appraisal can be alienating to lay audiences9\nand under these circumstances, while offering some clarity, structured risk management10\nframeworks run a potential danger of implicitly assuming that the technical perspective11\nis somehow pre-eminent (Petts et al., 2000) to other considerations. In many regulatory12\nsettings, some commentators have argued a potential disparity exists between a13\npractical need to define regulatory procedures and the desire to engage the public in risk14\ndecisions where the \u2018technical\u2019 language of risk will compete with the colloquial15\nlanguage of the public (Petts et al., 2000). Being clear about expectations, therefore at16\nthe outset is critical if they are to be managed and met.17\nProblem Formulation\nRisk Prioritisation Hazard Identification\nIdentification of Consequences\nMagnitude of Consequences\nProbability of Consequences\nSignificance of the Risk\n* Stages with each tier of\nRisk Assessment\nEconomics Technology\nSocial Issues Management\nRisk Management\nCollect data, iterate processes & monitor\nTier 1 Risk Screening *\nTier 2 Generic Quantitative\nRisk Assessment *\nTier 3 Detailed quantitative\nRisk Assessment *\nOptions Appraisal\nTiered Risk Assessment\n\uf052 \uf052\n18\nConclusions1\nIt is clear from the above review and discussion that a growing literature exists on the2\nintegration of tools for decision-making on land contamination. Clearly there are3\npotential traps for both practitioners and decision-makers on the capacity of these tools4\nto delivery improved decisions and assistance is required for the decision-making5\ncommunity on how best to integrate the outputs of various techniques. However, we6\ncan conclude that7\n(i) Decision-making frameworks can add value by making the routes to decisions8\ntransparent.9\n(ii) The current literature on environmental decision-making suggests that10\ntechnically driven decisions made in isolation of other concerns is insufficient for11\nmany stakeholders.12\n(iii) Recent developments suggest a move forward to sustainable land management13\nin the context of brownfield regeneration will necessitate the development and14\napplication of a broader and integrated portfolio of decision techniques.15\n(iv) We have yet to work through the implications of applying these tools alongside16\none another and develop the interfaces so they become commonplace for17\npractitioners.18\n19\nReferences1\nAlker S, Joy V, Roberts P and Smith, N The Definition of brownfield.
