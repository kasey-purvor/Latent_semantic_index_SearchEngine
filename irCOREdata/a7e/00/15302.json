Empirical Evidence From New Data and a Meta-Analysis  \n \n \nRomance of Leadership \n2 \nAbstract \nIn prior research, mixed results were obtained with respect to the relationship between \nRomance of Leadership and the perception of transformational leadership. In this paper, we \nfirst present new studies originating from different contexts (students and employees) and \ndifferent countries and, second, we meta-analyse these studies together with prior studies in \norder to shed light on the relationship between Romance of Leadership and the perception of \ntransformational leadership. In the meta-analysis, we considered the following moderators: \nField\/employees vs. experimental\/student samples region of origin, and type of assessment of \ntransformational leadership. The results indicate a positive relationship between Romance of \nLeadership and the perception of transformational leadership. Only the moderating effect of \nregion of origin was significant. In line with social constructivism and information processing \napproaches of leadership, our results indicate that the perception of leadership is comprised of \nmore than merely the actual behaviour the leader exhibits. \n \nKeywords: transformational leadership, implicit leadership theories, Romance of Leadership \nRomance of Leadership \n3 \nIs Charisma Hyper-Romanticism? Empirical Evidence From New Data and a Meta-Analysis  \n \nOne of the core questions in recent leadership research concerns the extent to which the \nperception of leadership is biased by follower characteristics (e.g., Need for leadership: de \nVries, Roe, Taillieu, 1999; Big Five: Felfe & Schyns, 2006) or the extent to which leadership \nis a social construction (e.g., Keller, 1999). Early research by Lord and colleagues (e.g., for an \noverview see Lord & Maher, 1993) already suggests that information given to individuals, \naffects their perception of leaders. This means that leadership is indeed (at least partly) a \nsocial construction of the perceiver. An extreme position in this discussion is taken by Meindl \n(1990), who regards leadership as being completely a social construction. As Meindl (1998a) \nputs it, \u201cThe romance of leadership perspective [...] assumes that the relationship between \nleaders and followers is primarily a constructed one, heavily influenced by interfollower \nfactors and relationships. The behavioral linkage between the leader and follower is seen as a \nderivative of the construction made by followers\u201d (p. 286). With his Romance of Leadership \napproach, he suggests that some individuals may be especially prone to romanticize \nleadership, that is, to regard leaders as responsible for all the successes and failures of \norganizations, thereby ignoring other factors. This idea has been supported in a series of \nstudies (Meindl, Ehrlich & Dukerich, 1985). \nAn important consequence of this perspective is that the social construction of \nleadership is not only likely to affect the perception of leaders in general but also the \nperception of the actual supervisor. Rush, Thomas and Lord (1977) found, for example, that \nperformance information influences ratings of leaders. This means that the perception of \nleaders is not independent of other information that perceivers receive. In addition, prior to \nmeeting a leader, individuals have ideas about how leaders are or should be, that is, they have \nimplicit leadership theories (e.g., Eden & Leviatan, 1975; Offermann, Kennedy & Wirtz, \nRomance of Leadership \n4 \n1994). These theories impact on how leaders are perceived (e.g. Shamir, 1992). This impact \nbecomes particularly obvious in the relationship between Romance of Leadership and \ntransformational \/ charismatic leadership. Meindl (1990) argues that transformational \/ \ncharismatic leadership is \u201chyper-romanticism\u201d (p. 182). According to him, \u201cTransformational \nleadership, with its emphasis on charisma and vision, is in part a matter of perception and \nattribution, myth and symbol, that is likely to have a romanticized component to it.\u201d (p. 182). \nThat charismatic leadership in particular is prone to perception biases can be derived from \nWeber (1921) who states with respect to charisma: \u201chow the quality [charisma] would be \nevaluated as \u201eobjectively\u201f correct from whatever ethic, aesthetic or other point of view does \nnot, of course, matter on a conceptual basis. All that matters is how it is indeed evaluated by \nthe charismatically mastered, the supporter\u201d (p. 140, own translation). This raises the question \nof how reliable the evaluation of transformational leadership is when assessed through \nfollower ratings. To what extent are leaders who are labelled \u201ctransformational\u201d really \ntransformational or is this label in part a projection of followers based on their inclination to \nromanticize leadership? \nEmpirically, results with respect to the relationship between Romance of Leadership \nand transformational \/ charismatic leadership have been quite mixed (Al-Dmour & Awamleh, \n2002; Awamleh, 2003; Awamleh & Gardner, 1999; Meindl, 1990; Schyns & Sanders, 2004). \nThis paper summarizes several new studies, which investigate samples from different settings \n(students and employees) and from different countries. In addition, we meta-analyse these \nnew studies along with prior studies in order to systematically synthesize the existing body of \nresearch on the relationship between Romance of Leadership and transformational \/ \ncharismatic leadership and investigate the impact of a few variables that potentially moderate \nthis relationship.  \nRomance of Leadership \nRomance of Leadership \n5 \nThe Romance of Leadership approach (e.g., Meindl, 1990, 1998a) focuses on the belief that \nleaders are responsible for the successes and failures of organizations, implying that factors \nother than leadership (such as economy or context) are ignored. Whereas Meindl (1990) \noriginally defined Romance of Leadership as an implicit theory about organizations, he argues \nmore recently that it is an implicit leadership theory as well (Schyns & Meindl, 2005).  \nThe first studies summarized in Meindl et al. (1985) focused on Romance of \nLeadership as a societal phenomenon by showing that the attention paid to company leaders is \nparticularly high in times of high or low, as opposed to medium, company performance. \nMeindl et al. examined Romance of Leadership on two different levels, namely, societal and \nindividual. On a societal level, they found, for example, that in times of good or bad company \nperformance, economy journals tend to focus on the leaders of those companies. On an \nindividual level, the same result emerged: Information about the performance of an \norganization biases the attribution of responsibility to the leader. Moreover, empirical findings \nshow that the individual propensity to romanticize leadership is related to followers\u201f \npersonality (Felfe, 2005; Meindl, 1990). These results provide additional support for the \nassumption that followers\u201f characteristics influence the perception of leadership via their \nimplicit leadership theories. \nRomance of Leadership and transformational \/ charismatic leadership \nBefore exploring the relationship between Romance of Leadership and transformational \/ \ncharismatic leadership more deeply, we want to make our definitions of these leadership \nstyles explicit. First, we agree with Bass\u201f (1985) definition of transformational leadership as \nexceptional leadership, characterized by visions, stimulation and motivation of followers. \nSecond, although there is an ongoing discussion about possible differences between \ntransformational leadership and charisma (e.g., Yukl, 1999), we will regard them as more or \nless interchangeable and summarize them under the term transformational \/ charismatic \nRomance of Leadership \n6 \nleadership, following the assumption that the two concepts have more characteristics in \ncommon than not (House & Shamir, 1993).  \nIn the following section, we will consider the relationship between Romance of \nLeadership and transformational \/ charismatic leadership from a theoretical perspective. As \nnoted above, Meindl (1990) carried out an attributional analysis of leadership perceptions and \nbelieved transformational leadership to be highly romanticized. Considering that charisma and \ntransformational leadership have much in common, we can see similarities between Meindl\u201fs \nposition and the one taken by Weber (1921), who views charisma as being present only when \nfollowers perceive it as such. In Meindl\u201fs terms, the social construction of charisma involves \nviewing leaders as exceptional, which is to say, to romanticize them.  \nRelevant research on information processing in the context of leadership may also help \nus to theoretically clarify the relationship between Romance of Leadership and \ntransformational leadership. This research has found that the attribution of leadership is not \nindependent of performance information (e.g., Lord & Maher, 1993). In particular, individuals \nattribute more leadership to leaders of successful groups, a finding that is in line with \npredictions of the Romance of Leadership approach. As transformational \/ charismatic \nleadership is based on the idea of exceptional, successful leadership, we can expect that \nindividuals who have a tendency to romanticize leadership will not only perceive leadership \nmore strongly but, more specifically, tend to attribute more transformational \/ charismatic \nleadership. \nA different line of research, however, suggests a negative relationship between \nRomance of Leadership and charisma. Based on expectancy violation theory (Jussim, \nColeman, & Lerch, 1987; Jussim, Fleming, Coleman, & Kohberger, 1996), we could assume \nthat Romance of Leadership involves high expectations towards an actual leader, which may \nlead to a lower rating of charisma, when expectations are not met. Similarly, transferring \nRomance of Leadership \n7 \nresearch on relationship standards (Kohn & Sayers, 2005) can lead us to expect that, when \nleaders do not live up to standards, their charismatic evaluation may suffer.  \nOn the empirical side, several studies have yielded mixed results with respect to the \nrelationship between Romance of Leadership and the perception of transformational \/ \ncharismatic leadership. Meindl (1988, in Meindl, 1990) found that the Romance of Leadership \nscale was positively related to the charisma subscale of the Multifactor Leadership \nQuestionnaire (MLQ, Bass, 1985). This result was supported by research on employees in \nJordanian banks (Awamleh, 2003), Jordanian sales managers (Al-Dmour & Awamleh, 2002) \nand Israeli students (Shamir 1992). Awamleh and Gardner (1999) did however report a \ncontrasting result for US-American students: Here, Romance of Leadership was not related to \ntransformational leadership. Finally, Ehrlich, Meindl, and Viellieu (1990) found low \ncorrelations between Romance of Leadership and subscales of transformational leadership. \nThere was even one negative relationship for intellectual stimulation. This result may seem \nmore plausible when we consider the fact that, in comparison to the other subdimensions of \ntransformational leadership, intellectually stimulating behaviour does not focus as much on \nthe central and extraordinary role of the leader. Instead, the focus of intellectual stimulation is \non the empowerment of the follower. Consequently, followers who romanticize their leaders \nmay experience less stimulation and empowerment. Despite these mixed empirical results, we \nwill assume based on our theoretical considerations that employees who tend to romanticize \nleaders also regard their own leaders as transformational \/ charismatic.  \nH 1: Romance of Leadership is positively related to the perception of transformational \/ \ncharismatic leadership.  \nThe fact that the results found for the relationship between Romance of Leadership \nand transformational leadership are mixed suggests that it could be fruitful to look for \nmoderators of that relationship. This point is addressed in the following section.  \nRomance of Leadership \n8 \nPossible moderators of the relationship between Romance of Leadership \nand transformational \/ charismatic leadership \nAs noted above, the relationship between Romance of Leadership and transformational \/ \ncharismatic leadership has been varying between studies. The meta-analytic part of our \nmanuscript investigates moderators that might explain these differences.  \nStudent versus employee samples (experiment versus field study) \nIn some of the above-mentioned studies, the samples comprised of students. In others, the \nrelationship between Romance of Leadership and transformational \/ charismatic leadership \nwas examined using employee samples. An important difference between those types of \nsamples is the design of the studies: While students rated descriptions of different leaders or \nvideo-tapes, following an experimental design, employees rated their actual supervisors. We \nsuspect that the use of these different types of samples and design may explain differences in \nthe correlations between Romance of Leadership and transformational leadership: First of all, \nstudents are less experienced with leadership and will therefore probably have a more \u201crosy\u201d \nand less differentiated image of leaders. We expect that this has an impact not only on \nRomance of Leadership but also on the relationship between Romance of Leadership and the \nperception of leadership. People whose image of a leader is less differentiated are expected to \nhave a stronger bias in the perception of actual leadership than more experienced employees. \nSecond, as mentioned above, in student studies, the leaders are not real persons. Rather, actors \nor descriptions are employed to expose participants to leadership. In these studies, there is \nlittle (if any) interaction between the participants and the leaders. Therefore, a generalized \nimage such as Romance of Leadership should have a stronger impact on the perception of \nleadership.  \nRomance of Leadership \n9 \nH 2: In experimental\/student samples, the correlation between Romance of Leadership \nand transformational \/ charismatic leadership will be higher than in field\/employee \nsamples.  \nRegion of origin \nWith respect to the different countries involved in our meta-analysis, we will focus on cultural \ndifferences between country clusters. Studies have so far been conducted in Germany, the \nNetherlands, the US, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Israel. However, because \nthe number of relevant studies is rather small for a meta-analysis, and to avoid ending up at \nthe individual study \/ country level, we concentrate on possible differences between \nmeaningful country clusters. We identified three clusters, namely, West Europe (Germany \nand the Netherlands), the US, and the Middle East (Jordan, United Arab Emirates and Israel). \nBased on Hofstede\u201fs (2001) cultural dimensions, we can expect relevant differences between \nthese country clusters, mainly on the Individualism \/ Collectivism dimension. According to \nHofstede (2001), this dimension focuses on the degree to which the society reinforces \nindividual vs. collective achievement and emphasizes interpersonal relationships. A higher \nranking on the scale indicates higher collectivism and lower individualism. The rank scores \nfor the countries were as follows: The Netherlands rank 4-5, Germany 15, the US ranks 1, the \nUAE 26-27, and Israel 19 (Hofstede, 2001). No data were available on Jordan.  \nIt is difficult to derive clear-cut expectations with respect to the impact of the region of \norigin on the relationship between Romance of Leadership and transformational \/ charismatic \nleadership. Taking into account Individualism \/ Collectivism, two different assumptions can \nbe derived. On the one hand, collectivists may tend to defer responsibility for group \nperformance onto others as opposed to themselves and may therefore defer responsibility onto \nleaders. On the other hand, individualists may be more prone to attribute responsibility to \nsingle persons and therefore may also attribute responsibility for group performance to \nRomance of Leadership \n10 \nleaders. We therefore assume that region of origin will moderate the relationship between \nRomance of Leadership and transformational \/ charismatic leadership but do not engage in \nspeculations about the direction of moderation. \nH 3: The relationship between Romance of Leadership and transformational \/ \ncharismatic leadership is expected to be different for different regions of origin of the \nsamples.  \nAssessment of transformational \/ charismatic leadership \nThroughout this article, we have treated transformational and charismatic leadership as \ninterchangeable constructs. We nevertheless wanted to check for the validity of this \nassumption, especially considering the fact that different instruments are used to assess these \nconcepts. Therefore, for exploratory reasons, we include type of concept \/ assessment (MLQ \nvs. Charisma) as a potential moderator variable. In the following section, we will first briefly \ndescribe our own studies, before we turn to the meta-analysis of these and other studies. \nStudy 1: East-German and West-German students \nIn our first study, we examined the relationship between Romance of Leadership and the \nperception of transformational leadership using student samples and an experimental design. \nMethod \nDesign and procedure \nIn study 1, an experimental design was employed to examine the relationship between \nRomance of Leadership and the perception of transformational leadership. The participants \nwere asked to take part in the study at the end of lectures. Two questionnaires were \ndistributed. First, students were asked to indicate their Romance of Leadership and \ndemographic data such as age, gender, course of studies, and professional training (t1). \nSecond, the participants were divided into two groups: One group was given a description of a \ntransformational leader; the other group was given a description of a transactional leader (t2, \nRomance of Leadership \n11 \nfor more details on the description see Kirkpatrick & Locke, 1996; Felfe & Schyns, 2006). \nThey were asked to rate the respective leaders with regard to transformational leadership. The \nquestionnaires were returned to the authors personally in exchange for course credits. \nParticipants \nFour student samples were drawn in this study. The first sample was made up of 132 students \n(including 121 psychology majors and eleven psychology minors) from two Universities in \nthe former East Germany\n1\n (East German sample 1). Most of them were women (108 women \nand 24 men). The mean age was 22.8 (SD = 3.9). Seventy of the students had work \nexperience. At t2, 114 participants (86.4%) of the first sample returned the questionnaire. In \nthe following year, the study was repeated with 62 students at one of the universities (mostly \npsychology students, 12 men and 50 women, average age 22 years, SD = 3.8, East German \nsample 2). A second replication was done still one year later with 85 students from the same \nuniversity and one West German university (49 psychology students and 36 business \nadministration students, 27 men and 57 women, average age 22.3 years, SD = 2.88, East \nGerman sample 3). The fourth group was comprised of 96 students from another West \nGerman University (economy and psychology students, 27 men and 69 women, average age \n24.6 years, SD = 4.1, West German sample). See Appendix 1 for an overview of all studies \nincluded here.  \nMaterials \nRomance of Leadership Scale. Romance of Leadership was assessed using Meindl\u201fs \n(1998b) instrument (German translation by Schyns, Meindl, & Croon, 2004). The scale \nranged from \u20133 (does not apply at all) to +3 (applies completely). Recent research has shown \nthat, seventeen of the original 32 items assess the core of Romance of Leadership (Schyns, \nMeindl, & Croon, 2004b, in press). This core focuses on the attribution of influence to \nleaders. We therefore used only these seventeen items here. The reliabilities (Cronbach\u201fs \nRomance of Leadership \n12 \nalpha) of the core instrument were .87 for the first East German student group, .79 for the \nsecond East-German student group, .81 for the third East German student group, and .79 for \nthe West German students. \nTransformational Leadership. The participants were asked to evaluate the described \nleader with respect to transformational leadership. The instrument used for this purpose was \nthe Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (Bass & Avolio, 1995; adapted and modified \nGerman version: Felfe, 2006). The internal consistencies (Cronbach\u201fs alpha) of the 20-item \nscale were .91, .84, and .90 for the East-German student samples 1 to 3, respectively, and .92 \nfor the West German students. See Appendix 2 for means and standard deviations of charisma \nand Romance of Leadership for all studies. \nResults \nOur first hypothesis was tested using a correlational analysis. Since, in the present context, we \nare exclusively interested in perceptions of leadership and not in differences in leadership \nbehaviour per se, we computed all correlations across the transformational and transactional \nleadership descriptions. The perception that a leader is showing transformational leadership \nwas found to be positively correlated with Romance of Leadership for the East German \nstudent sample 1 (r = .38, p < .001) and for the East German student sample 3 (r = .29, p < \n.01). The correlation was significant neither for the second East German student sample (r = \n.12, n.s.) nor for the West German students (r = .01, n.s.). Thus, H1 is partly supported. \nSummary of study 1 and outlook \nWe examined the correlation between Romance of Leadership and the perception of \ntransformational leadership on four (German) student samples. Romance of Leadership was \nrelated to the perception of leadership in two of the East German student samples. We \nexpected experimental\/student samples to produce higher correlations between Romance of \nLeadership and transformational leadership than field\/employee samples. In contrast to results \nRomance of Leadership \n13 \nfound in a US student sample, which were small and non-significant (Awamleh & Gardner, \n1999), results for two of our samples reveal a considerable relationship between the two \nconstructs. It will be left to the meta-analysis to uncover whether or not the effects found in \nthe different studies are due to special study characteristics.  \nStudy 2: German, Dutch, and US employees \nMethod \nSimilar to Study 1, Study 2 was designed to examine hypothesis 1. This study comprised \nsamples of employees rating their actual leaders rather than leader descriptions.  \nDesign and procedure \nThe participants were approached during their working time and asked to fill in the \nquestionnaire. In Germany\n2\n, participants filled in the questionnaires in small groups; in the \nNetherlands and the US, the questionnaire was handed out and participants were asked to \nreturn it when completed. The participants first answered questions concerning demographic \ndata, such as age, sex, and work experience, before going on to answer items concerning \nRomance of Leadership and the perception of transformational leadership in their actual \nleader. In the Netherlands and the US, transformational leadership was assessed at different \npoints in time. In Germany, this was not possible.  \nParticipants \nIn Germany, 202 employees of 20 organizations (banks and insurances) took part in this \nstudy. One hundred and twenty-four were female, 77 male (1 not indicated). The mean age \nwas 35.6 years (SD = 9.8). On average, the participants worked for 19.1 years (SD = 10.6). \nSixty-three of the participants were currently holding or had been holding a leader position. In \nthe Netherlands, 190 employees of one big accountancy company took part in the study. Of \nthe participants, 89 were male and 100 were female (1 not indicated). On average, they were \n34.3 years of age (SD = 10.0, 6 not indicated) and had 14.9 years of work experience (SD = \nRomance of Leadership \n14 \n10.4, 1 not indicated). Forty-seven participants had worked as a supervisor (currently or in the \npast, 1 not indicated). In the US, 107 employees from different accountancy companies took \npart in the study (43 men, 60 female, 4 not indicated). On average, they were 38.5 years old \n(SD = 11.4, 6 not indicated) and had 16.7 years of work experience (SD = 11.1, 5 missing). 49 \nof the participants reported having experience working as a manager (4 not indicated). \nMaterials \nRomance of Leadership was assessed, as in Study 1, with Meindl\u201fs (1998b) Romance \nof Leadership scale (German translation by Schyns, Meindl, & Croon, 2004a; Dutch \ntranslation by Schyns, Meindl, & Soeters, 2004). The scale ranged from \u20133 (does not apply at \nall) to +3 (applies completely). For the Dutch participants, the scale ranged from 1 to 7, with \nthe same verbal anchors. As above, only the seventeen core items were considered here. The \nreliabilities (Cronbach\u201fs alpha) were .88, .83, and .80 for the German, Dutch, and US \nemployees, respectively. \nTransformational leadership. The participants were asked to evaluate their actual \nleader with respect to transformational leadership. The instrument used was the Multifactor \nLeadership Questionnaire (Bass & Avolio, 1995; German version: Felfe, 2006; Dutch \nversion: Vinkenburg & van Engen, 2002). The internal consistency (Cronbach\u201fs alpha) of the \n20-item scale was .94 for the German, .91 for the Dutch, and .94 for the US employees. See \nAppendix 2 for means and standard deviations of charisma and Romance of Leadership for all \nstudies. \nResults \nTest of hypotheses \nOur first hypothesis was tested using a correlational analysis. Romance of Leadership was not \nsignificantly related to the perception of the leader being transformational, neither for the \nRomance of Leadership \n15 \nGerman employees (r = .09, n.s.), nor for the Dutch employees (r = -.01, n.s.), nor for the US \nemployees (r = .13, n.s.). This indicates no support for H1 in the employee samples.\n3\n \nA comparison of the results from Study 2 to those from Study 1 is relevant for our \nsecond hypothesis (stronger correlation between Romance of Leadership and transformational \nleadership in experimental\/student as compared to field\/employee samples). And indeed, at \nfirst glance the correlations obtained in Study 2 involving employees were lower than those \nfound in Study 1 involving students. Before drawing conclusions, however, this issue will be \npursued further in our meta-analysis. \nSummary of study 2 and outlook \nRomance of Leadership and transformational leadership were not significantly correlated for \nany of the employee samples. Although we did expect lower correlations for Romance of \nLeadership and transformational leadership in employee samples, we still expected that, in \ngeneral, the correlation would be positive and significant. Other studies in organizations have \nindeed found substantial correlations (e.g., Al-Dmour & Awamleh, 2002; Ehrlich et al., \n1990). However, these samples come from different cultures (Al-Dmour & Awamleh, 2002; \nAwamleh, 2003). The following meta-analysis will clarify if such differences in study \nbackground can explain the differing results. \nMeta-Analysis \nMethod \nInclusion and exclusion of studies \nIn order to examine overall correlations between Romance of Leadership and transformational \n\/ charismatic leadership, we carried out a meta-analysis. Studies were collected using \nPsycInfo with the search term \u201cRomance of Leadership\u201d and \u201ctransformational or charismatic \nleadership\u201d. In addition, authors of prior studies were contacted and asked if they had \nconducted further studies using both constructs that had not yet been published. The final \nRomance of Leadership \n16 \nsample for the meta-analysis comprised eighteen studies, including published and \nunpublished papers as well as conference presentations. One dissertation had to be excluded, \nbecause the sample was the same as in a published journal article (Awamleh, 1997; Awamleh \n& Gardner, 1999). Another study was excluded although it used both concepts, because it did \nnot use employees, students or leaders in its sample, but was a one-case study involving the \nattribution of leadership with respect to a single leader (Horner, 1992). A third article was \nexcluded because no information was available concerning the correlations on an individual \nlevel (Haslam et al., 2001, see Appendix 1 for more information on the included studies). In \nsum, eleven studies conducted by other researchers plus the studies we reported here were \nincluded in the meta-analysis. \nAnalyses \nOur meta-analysis followed the standard procedures suggested by Cooper and Hedges (1994) \nand Hedges and Olkin (1985). A first step involved calculating a weighted average for the 18 \nsamples correlations (see Appendix 1 for a list of included studies, moderator levels, and \ncorrelations) in order to estimate the overall population correlation between Romance of \nLeadership and transformational \/ charismatic leadership. Second, we assessed the \nhomogeneity of the study correlations, that is, their variation around the estimated population \ncorrelation, and looked for potential outliers. Finally, we tested for the influence of \nmoderators. We investigated three potential moderators, as stated in the introduction, (1) \nregion of origin (country clusters: West Europe vs. Middle East vs. US), (2) participants \n(employees vs. students), and (3) the particular construct used in the investigation of \ntransformational \/ charismatic leadership (MLQ vs. Charisma).  \nA preliminary analysis assessed the homogeneity of correlations between Romance of \nLeadership and subscales of transformational leadership in those studies that relied on the \nMLQ questionnaire to measure transformational \/ charismatic leadership. This seemed \nRomance of Leadership \n17 \nnecessary because at least one study (Ehrlich et al., 1990) had found substantial differences in \nthe magnitudes of the correlations between Romance of Leadership and different \ntransformational leadership subscales within the same sample. Such differences could be of \ntheoretical and practical interest. Thus, we performed tests for the homogeneity of statistically \ndependent correlations (Cooper & Hedges, 1994; chap. 22) on 11 studies that investigated \ntransformational leadership using the MLQ questionnaire and reported subscale correlations. \nIn only two out of these 11 studies (Ehrlich et al., 1990; Schyns & Sanders, 2004) was \nhomogeneity rejected at the .05 level, indicating an overall tendency for correlations to be \nsimilar across transformational leadership subscales. Therefore, all following analyses are \nbased on transformational leadership values at the general scale level. No such general level \ncorrelation was reported in the Ehrlich et al. (1990) study and it was therefore estimated from \nthe subscale correlations according to the procedure described in Cooper and Hedges (1994; \nchap. 22).  \nResults \nAn initial meta-analytic integration of all 18 studies listed in Appendix 1 yielded an estimated \npopulation correlation between Romance of Leadership and transformational \/ charismatic \nleadership of r = .25. This correlation is based on a total sample size of N = 3312 participants \nand has therefore a very narrow 95% confidence interval (.22; .28). Also, it is associated with \nan extremely large Z score of 14.36, indicating a highly significant deviation from a zero \ncorrelation (p < .001).  \nHowever, a subsequent homogeneity analysis showed that our set of study correlations \nwas extremely heterogeneous. The homogeneity statistic Q (actually a misnomer, because \nlarge values indicate deviations from homogeneity) was at a high 289.88, a value that is \nconsiderably larger than what could be expected by chance. The statistic is chi-square \ndistributed and has 17 degrees of freedom in our case (number of studies minus one); the null \nRomance of Leadership \n18 \nhypothesis of homogeneity is therefore rejected at p < .01. An outlier analysis (e.g., Hedges & \nOlkin, 1985; chap. 12) identified three studies as outliers (Al-Dmour & Awamleh, 2002, r = \n.72; Awamleh, 2003, r = .56; Schyns, Kroon & Moors, unpublished, r = -.06). Removal of \nthese outliers renders the remaining set of studies homogenous (Q = 20.22, df = 14, p = .12) \nbut reduces the estimated population correlation between Romance of Leadership and \nTransformational Leadership to r = .15. Nevertheless, this correlation is clearly different from \nzero (Z = 7.13, p < .001); its 95% confidence interval reaches from .11 to .19.  \nTo summarize this first set of analyses: Our meta-analytic integration, both with and \nwithout outlying studies, clearly supports our first hypothesis that tendencies to romanticize \nleadership are positively related to perceptions of transformational \/ charismatic leadership. \nHowever, it should be noted that the magnitude of this relationship only falls within the small \nto medium range, according to Cohen and Cohen\u201fs (1983) suggested conventions.  \nA final set of analyses was directed at the possible impact of moderator variables on \nthe magnitude of this relationship. Because three outlying studies had been identified, these \nanalyses were conducted both with and without outliers. Table 1 gives a summary of the \nresults. The Qb statistic indicates the amount of variance in study correlations that is explained \nby the moderator, and Qw reflects the remaining variance within levels of the moderator. \nIdeally, if a moderator explains all the variance between studies, there should be no \nsignificant remaining heterogeneity within moderator levels.  \nThe first thing that can be noted in the pattern of results in Table 1 is the enormous \ndifferences resulting from the inclusion or exclusion of outliers. Paralleling the simple \nhomogeneity analyses presented above, there were no significant (at a level of .05 or less) \nremaining deviations from homogeneity either between or within moderator levels if the \noutliers were excluded from analysis. This means that all significant heterogeneity in those \nanalyses, which included outliers, is wholly due to these outliers, leaving us with the difficult \nRomance of Leadership \n19 \ndecision as to whether or not to trust any of those results, which include the outliers. There is \nno fail-safe statistical way to solve this dilemma because there might in fact be meaningful, \nsubstantial factors underlying the outlying values. However, a useful indicator with respect to \nthe question as to whether or not a moderator effect including outliers is artificial or real \nmight be whether or not the patterns of mean effects changes as a result of excluding the \noutliers. With respect to this criterion, the only meaningful moderator is the region of origin \n(Asia vs. Europe vs. US). Here, the rank ordering of the moderator level means is \napproximately preserved (.47, .09, and .09 vs. .21, .13, and .09). This cannot be said of the \nother two moderators, participants (hypothesis 2: field\/employees vs. experimental\/students) \nand construct assessment\n4\n (charisma vs. MLQ). Region of origin is also the moderator with \nthe highest Qb value (133.07) in the inclusive analysis, and the corresponding value when \noutliers are excluded (4.77) remains at least marginally significant (p = .09). Finally, the \npattern of mean correlations is in the expected direction in both cases. Hence, we conclude \nthat our third hypothesis, in which we expected to find regional differences resulting from \ndiffering degrees of Individualism, is at least tentatively supported. Because of changing \npatterns of results as a consequence of excluding outliers, we can only draw tentative \nconclusions with respect to the impact of the other moderators. In line with our second \nhypothesis, examining field\/employee vs. experimental\/student samples without outliers leads \nto a higher correlation for students.  \nGeneral discussion, limitations, future research, and conclusions \nThe aim of this study was to clarify the relationship between Romance of Leadership \nand transformational leadership. In order to do so, we employed several new samples from \ndifferent countries and meta-analysed these together with existing studies. Results from our \nown samples only partly supported the idea that Romance of Leadership and transformational \nleadership are positively related. Given the results of the meta-analysis, however, we can \nRomance of Leadership \n20 \nconclude that the relationship does indeed exist, which supports Meindl\u201fs (1990) idea of \ntransformational leadership as \u201chyper-romanticism\u201d. Although we argued referring to Weber \n(1921) that particularly charismatic leadership is prone to perception biases for theoretical \nreasons, it remains an open empirical question if this is a specific link. This could be easily \ntested by integrating other leadership dimensions, such as consideration or initiating of \nstructure. \nWith respect to the results of our moderator analyses, only region of origin remains as \na significant moderator. This result has to be considered in light of the limitations of our \nstudy. A problem in our meta-analysis was that the two Jordanian studies turned out to be \noutliers. This fact limits the generalizability of our results, as some moderators are only \nsignificant because of these studies. It is difficult to know whether or not these studies are \noutliers due to particularities of the sample or due to methodological reasons. However, as \ntwo of these studies reported particularly high correlations, we may assume that the results \nmay be inflated, and the studies should better be excluded from the analyses. In terms of \nfuture research, it is important to note the existence of outliers in meta-analyses and the \neffects they may have. On the other hand, one could say that the chance to find moderating \neffects at all is limited when the studies included in a meta-analysis are very homogeneous.   \nWe did not find experimental\/student and field\/employee sample to be a significant \nmoderator. However, we need take into account confoundation effects here. Students rated \nonly two different leaders so all variance is due to perception while in the employee samples, \nreal differences between leader may have been occurring. Consequently, future research, all \nthree factors should be systematically randomized: students versus employees, experimental \nversus field and one leader or several leaders presented. \nTogether with our own samples, eighteen studies could be included in the meta-\nanalysis. This small number of studies naturally leaves certain questions open. Although, \nRomance of Leadership \n21 \ngenerally spoken, a meta-analysis allows better conclusions about a relationship than single \nstudies, more studies would be necessary to confirm our results. Only three moderators \n(field\/employees vs. experimental\/students, country of origin and assessment of \ntransformational leadership) could be considered in our study. It would certainly be fruitful to \nconsider other possible moderators as well. One example could be types of organization, in \nthat future research could explore the differences in the relationship between the two concepts \nin different sectors of industry. Another example could be education, in that the relationship \nmay differ for individuals with different educational backgrounds. It might also be interesting \nto examine the extent to which the relationship changes with different situations, for example, \nwith the performance status of an organization. We may expect that the romanticisation and \nthe perception of transformational leadership equally increase in times of good company \nperformance, as leaders may be held responsible for the good performance and may therefore \nbe seen as exhibiting exceptional leadership.  \nAnother limitation is to be found in the studies included: First, all studies used the \nsame source to assess Romance of Leadership and the perception of a leader. Although this is \nnatural to the research question investigated, future research could try and assess Romance of \nLeadership using assessment different from questionnaires, such as more implicit methods \n(e.g., the implicit association test, Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998) to decrease the \neffect of same source bias. Second, none of the studies differentiated between situations of \nsuccess versus failure. Thus, in our meta-analysis, we could not use this information as a \nmoderator. The limitation that results is that our correlations are based on a general level of \nperception, rather than on a differentiation between states of success or failure with respect to \nRomance of Leadership. This then should be rectified in future research. It is possible that the \ncorrelations would be different when taking this information into account. However, prior \nresearch (Horner, 1992; Meindl, Ehrlich, & Dukerich, 1985) implies that Romance of \nRomance of Leadership \n22 \nLeadership takes place in both cases of exceptionally good and exceptionally poor \nperformance. \nIn addition, no mediators were included in the studies we analysed. Given the line of \nthought of expectancy violation theory (Jussim et al., 1987, 1996) or relationship standards \n(Kohn & Sayers, 2005), it could be interesting for future research to analyse in how far \nsupervisors live up to their followers\u201f expectations, for example, by assessing the preference \nfor idealized styles of supervision (Vecchio & Boatwright, 2002).  \nAlthough some of the studies included were cross-sectional and none of the studies \nexplicitly used a complete longitudinal design, we can assume that Romance of Leadership \nimpacts on the perception of transformational leaders rather than the other way round. This \nassumption is based on results obtained by Epitropaki and Martin (2004) who found that \nimplicit leadership theories are relatively stable over time. Perceptions of leaders, in contrast \nwill be less stable as they at least change from leader to leader. However, we can not rule out \nthat, for example, when actual leaders are considered ineffective, this affects the general \nassumption of effectiveness of leadership, that is, negatively affects Romance of leadership.  \nFor organizational practice our results imply that \u2013 at least in the case of \ntransformational leadership \u2013 the perception of leadership is affected by more than only the \nleader\u201fs actual behaviour. Taking into account that the evaluation of leadership is biased by \nimplicit leadership theories this sheds new light on the reliability of followers\u201f assessments of \ntheir respective leaders. This is actually important information for leaders, particularly when it \ncomes to interpreting followers\u201f feedback. Our results suggest that followers\u201f ratings \u2013 \nwhether positive or negative \u2013 should not always be taken at face value. Followers high in \nRomance of Leadership are prone to make too positive assessments and followers low in \nRomance of Leadership may show the opposite bias. This can be of practical importance as \nthe evaluation is related to the acceptance of the respective leader. Moreover, leaders with \nRomance of Leadership \n23 \nfollowers high in Romance of Leadership will be given more credit for their actions and \nprojects. For example, Felfe and Petersen (in press) showed that Romance of Leadership even \ninfluenced managerial decision making in a way that persons high in Romance of Leadership \ntended to (a) overestimate leaders\u201f capabilities and (b) neglect other relevant cues in a specific \nsituation. Thus, leaders should be aware of being systematically over- or underestimated and \nshould consider the factors that enhance these up- or downward biases. As shown in our \nstudy, at least one important factor seems to be the followers\u201f implicit leadership theories. It \nmay be helpful to control for Romance of Leadership in feedback procedures. Considering \nthat Romance of Leadership is supposed to occur with unexpected success or failure, leaders \nshould be particularly careful with the interpretation of the feedback they receive if the \nperformance of their group, their department, or the organization is unexpectedly high or low. \nMoreover there is some empirical evidence that Romance of Leadership is also related to \nfollowers\u201f personalities. Felfe (2005) found followers\u201f self-efficacy, self-esteem and \nextraversion to be positively related to their tendency to romanticize leadership. To \nsummarize, leaders (or their supervisors who also interpret subordinates\u201f evaluation) should \nbe aware of the situation and the characteristics of the followers who provided the feedback. \n \nRomance of Leadership \n24 \nReferences \nReferences marked with a * were included in the meta-analysis \n* Al-Dmour, H. & Awamleh, R.

Treating data from East and West Germany separately is therefore common (see \nalso the GLOBE study, House, Hanges, Javidan, Dorfman, & Gupta, 2004). \n2\n The sample consisted mostly of East German participants. \n3\n A reviewer of this work made the interesting suggestion that the relationship \nbetween Romance of Leadership and transformational leadership could also be curvilinear, \ndepending on the performance of the evaluated leader. Following Meindl et al.\u201fs (1985) \noriginal conception of Romance of Leadership as a tendency to attribute success or failure of \nan organization to its leader, one might expect individuals high in Romance of Leadership to \nattribute high levels of charismatic or transformational leadership to leaders if cases of good \nperformance but to deny their leaders these qualities in cases of poor performance. \nImportantly, these opposite tendencies might cancel each other out, resulting in a zero \ncorrelation between Romance of Leadership and transformational leadership. Although we \ndid not assess performance, we were able to test this assumption in our field\/employee \nsamples, based on the following logic: In natural circumstances, performance of leaders will \nvary. Given that people with a high value in Romance of Leadership will give low \ntransformational leadership ratings in case of low performance and high transformational \nleadership ratings in case of high performance, we expect a higher variance in \ntransformational leadership for high values of Romance of Leadership than for low values of \nRomance of Leadership. Accordingly, for each of the three employee samples, we divided the \nRomance of Leadership values into three categories: high, medium, and low. For each of \nthese categories, we calculated the standard deviations in transformational leadership. If the \nassumption was true, the standard deviations of transformational leadership should be highest \nRomance of Leadership \n35 \n                                                                                                                                                        \nfor high Romance of Leadership. This was in fact the case for the German data. However, in \nboth the Dutch and the US samples, the highest standard deviations occurred for low \nRomance of Leadership. Consequently, we have to reject the assumption of a curvilinear \nrelationship between Romance of Leadership and transformational leadership. \n4\n For completeness, we also assessed the potential impact of different ways to measure \nRomance of Leadership. Although significant in the inclusive analysis, this technical \nmoderator variable yielded no significant effects after removal of the outlying studies. \nMoreover, opposite patterns of means resulted in the inclusive and exclusive analyses. Hence, \ntype of assessment of Romance of Leadership does not seem to influence its correlation with \ntransformational \/ charismatic leadership in any meaningful way.  \n"}
