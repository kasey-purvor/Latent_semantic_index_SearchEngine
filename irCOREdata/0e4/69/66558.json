Introduction \n \nMuch palaeoglaciological effort is directed towards the reconstruction of large \nscale changes in ice sheet history associated with the retreat of ice sheet margins from \ntheir Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) positions (e.g. Funder and Hansen, 1996; Dyke \nand Prest, 1987; Conway et al., 1999; Andersen et al., 1995).  Attention is also paid to \nice sheet response to shorter-lived cold events such as the Younger Dryas (GS-1, \nWalker et al., 1999) and the Little Ice Age, during which intervals many ice masses \nslowed in their retreat or advanced.  These short-lived episodes are of special interest \nsince they provide an opportunity to examine the interaction between ice sheets, \natmosphere and ocean dynamics over periods of rapid climate change.   \n \nAs well as the GS-1 and the Little Ice Age, oxygen isotope records from the \nGreenland ice cores, GRIP and GISP2, reveal evidence for a pronounced short-lived \nclimate perturbation during the early Holocene that saw air temperatures over the \ncentre of the ice sheet fall by 5-7\u00baC (Alley et al., 1997; Alley and \u00c1g\u00fastsd\u00f3ttir, 2005).  \nDated to c. 8.2 ka cal. yr BP (hereafter termed the \u2018GH-8.2 event\u2019, Walker et al., \n1999), this event is attributed to a temporary slow-down or shut-down of the North \nAtlantic thermohaline circulation triggered by the drainage of meltwater from large \nproglacial lakes in North America (Barber et al., 1999; Teller et al., 2002; Clarke et \nal., 2004).  Despite the strong evidence of a climatic cooling in the ice cores, the \nresponse of the margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) to this short-lived event is \npoorly understood.  \n \nIn this paper we reconstruct the early Holocene deglacial history of Disko \n 3\nBugt, a large marine embayment in west Greenland.  This study area is of particular \ninterest since the ice sheet here is strongly influenced by the dynamics of the world\u2019s \nfastest flowing ice stream \u2013 Jakobshavns Isbrae \u2013 which drains a large portion of the \nGreenland Ice Sheet and discharges ice into Disko Bugt and Baffin Bay.  Previous \nwork has identified a widespread suite of early Holocene moraines in the eastern part \nof the bay (termed the \u2018Fjord Stade\u2019 moraines (Weidick, 1968)), that may possibly \nrecord an ice margin response to the GH-8.2 event (Long and Roberts, 2002).  We test \nthis hypothesis here with new observations from two field sites and, in so doing, \nexplore ice sheet and ice stream dynamics during the early Holocene across the \ninterval of the GH-8.2 event. \n \n2.  Ice sheet response to short-lived climate change \n \nMap and air photographic evidence suggest that the GIS responds in a \nrelatively rapid and predictable manner to climate cooling.  In a study of 500 glacier \nlobes from c. AD 1650 onwards, Weidick (1968) shows that there were several \nadvance phases during this interval, with many glaciers reaching their maximum \nextent and forming well-developed push moraines at c. AD 1850, AD 1890 and AD \n1920.  Weidick (1968, p.45) relates the latter of these to cold periods to \nmeteorological records between AD 1880-1890 and AD 1913-1916, and argues that \nthis correlation suggests a lag in the marginal response of the Greenland glaciers to \nclimate change of between a few years and two decades.  The study demonstrates that \n94% of the glaciers studied responded in phase, despite their wide geographical \ndistribution and individual glaciological characteristics.  This apparent link between \nclimate and ice margin response suggests that there should be clear evidence for other \n 4\ncooling events, such as that associated with the GH-8.2 event, recorded in the \nmarginal glacial landforms of the GIS.  \n \nOther glaciological studies, however, show that ice margin position and \nmoraine development can also be strongly influenced by topography, glacioterrestrial \nto glaciomarine\/lacustrine transitions and sedimentological controls, as oppose to \nclimatic factors (Boulton and Jones, 1979; Taylor et al., 2004).  Hillaire-Marcel et al. \n(1981), for example, argue that the formation of the Sakami moraines (Younger Dryas \nage) of the Laurentide Ice Sheet in Quebec were controlled by changes in lake level \nand not climate.  Moreover, modelling experiments by Hubbard (1999) shows that \nonce the Younger Dryas Scottish ice sheet advanced into coastal waters its dynamics \nwere essentially decoupled from direct climatic controls and instead became strongly \ndependent on topography and calving flux. \n \nIn western Greenland, geomorphological mapping shows a clearly defined \nsequence of prehistoric moraines that can be traced over hundreds of kilometres, the \nmost prominent of which formed during the early Holocene \u2018Fjord Stade\u2019 (Weidick \n(1968), Fig. 1).  Weidick (1974) suggests that the continuity of the Fjord Stade \nmoraines indicates that they were probably associated with a temporary decrease in \nsummer ablation and a short-lived change in ice sheet mass balance.  Others, \nhowever, favour a topographic control for their origin, citing the abundance of these \nmoraines within topographically restricted fjords (e.g. Warren and Hulton, 1990).  \nCritical to evaluating the climatological significance of these moraines is the \ndevelopment of a reliable absolute chronology for their formation.  Thus far, the main \nage control is provided by relative sea level (RSL) data collected from wide \n 5\ngeographical areas (e.g. Weidick, 1968), although more detailed data do exist for \nsome intensively studied sites such as S\u00f8ndre Str\u00f8mfjord (van Tatenhove et al., 1996). \n \n3.  The study area and previous research \n \nDisko Bugt is a large (40,000 km2) marine embayment between 68\u00b0 30\u2019 N and \n69\u00b0 15\u2019 N and 50\u00b0 00\u2019 W and 54\u00b0 00\u2019 W (Fig. 1).  The mainland bedrock geology \ncomprises Precambrian gneisses, with Tertiary basalts on the island of Disko and \nparts of the Nuussuaq peninsula (Chalmers et al., 1999).  Mean annual air temperature \nis c. -4\u00b0C and the bay is generally ice free between mid-April and mid-January.  \nWater depths in Disko Bugt typically vary between 200 m and 400 m and may locally \nexceed 1000 m.  At the LGM, Disko Bugt was fully occupied by grounded ice, with \nan enlarged Jakobshavns Isbrae extending offshore, onto the continental shelf of \nBaffin Bay (Funder and Hansen, 1996; Long and Roberts, 2003; Roberts and Long, \n2005).  Sometime before 10.5 ka cal. yr BP the margin of this ice stream became \nunstable and began to retreat into Disko Bugt, with calving into a deep (> 800 m) \ntrough at the mouth of Disko Bugt, followed by rapid retreat to the shallower eastern \npart of the bay.     \n \nA series of prominent moraines that lie broadly parallel to the eastern coastline \nof Disko Bugt suggest that the ice sheet margin slowed or paused here during its rapid \nearly Holocene retreat (Fig. 2).  These moraines belong to the \u201cFjord Stade\u201d moraine \ncomplex, one of a suite of moraines referred to above that can be traced across much \nof west Greenland between 5 km and 30 km from the inland ice, and that dates to c. \n9.3 ka cal. yr BP (Weidick, 1968; Kelly, 1985).  Long and Roberts (2002) re-\n 6\nevaluated the age of this moraine at Orpissooq, the informal type site of the Fjord \nStade in southeast Disko Bugt (Donner and Jungner, 1975) (Fig. 1) and suggested that \nhere the moraines date from between 8.4 and 7.7 ka cal. yr BP.  They cautiously \nsuggested that the moraine may record an ice marginal response of the GIS to the GH-\n8.2 event, although they recognised that further dating evidence from elsewhere in \nDisko Bugt was needed to test this hypothesis fully.  \n 7\n Fig. 1. Location map depicting the glacial landforms and deposits of Disko Bugt, west Greenland, modified from \nWeidick (1968) and including the location of offshore banks mapped by Brett and Zarudzki (1979). \n \nHere we present new age controls on the early Holocene retreat of the GIS \nfrom two sites in Disko Bugt (Fig. 1).  The first site is located at Upernivik, mid-way \n 8\nalong Jakobshavns Isfjord and east of the extensive Fjord Stade moraines in the centre \nof the bay.  This site provides a new RSL record that is used to review regional trends \nin sea level change and deglaciation.  The second site is at P\u00e2kitsoq, 30 km north of \nJakobshavns Isfjord, where a cluster of lakes also constrains the age of the Fjord \nStade moraine.  When combined with the data from Orpissooq, these sites provide a \nbroad north to south coverage of Fjord Stade moraines along the east coast of Disko \nBugt and enable us to test more thoroughly the evidence for a regional ice sheet \nresponse to the GH-8.2 event. \n 9\n Fig. 2. Location of the two main study sites showing the Quaternary sediment distribution and former ice margin \npositions (from the Danish Geological Survey). \n \n 10\n4.  Techniques \n \nWe use three lines of evidence - the elevation and age of the marine limit \n(ML), RSL data from isolation basins, and glaciological mapping - to establish the \ntiming and pattern of early Holocene ice sheet recession.  The age of the ML provides \na minimum estimate of the timing of deglaciation and can be established using RSL \ndata or by dating the onset of organic accumulation in lakes above the ML.  Our new \nRSL record developed from Upernivik is based on data collected from a staircase of \nisolation basins; natural rock depressions that were, at different times in their history, \nconnected to or isolated from the sea as a result of RSL change.  We cored these lakes \nwith a Russian sampler from a boat, and collected sample cores for laboratory \nanalysis using a piston corer.  We determined elevations using closed levelling \nsurveys with an EDM and a Sokisha level, with altitudes established with respect to \nmean sea level (MSL).  At Upernivik we used tidal observations collected with a sea-\nbed pressure transducer referenced to local tidal predictions for Ilulissat, and at \nP\u00e2kitsoq surveyed to the high water mark, also referenced to tide tables from Ilulissat.  \nThe tidal range in both field sites is c. 2.5 m.  The sill elevations of the isolation \nbasins are corrected to MSL based on the diatom assemblages preserved at the dated \nhorizon in the sample cores (see Long et al., 1999).  We measured the marine limit by \nsurveying the lower limit of perched boulders in each study area. \n \nCore material was prepared for diatom investigations using standard \ntechniques (Palmer and Abbot, 1986) and diatom identifications were made with \nreference to Van der Werff and Huls (1958-1974), Hustedt (1957), Patrick and \nReimer (1966, 1975), Hendey (1964) and Foged (1972, 1973, 1977). Diatom counts \n 11\nare expressed as a percentage of total diatom valves (%TDV) and full counts are \navailable from the lead author on request.  The chronology is based on Accelerator \nMass Spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dates on thin (0.5 to 1 cm) bulk sediment \nslices of lake gyttja (Table I). The calibration program used is the INTERNET CALIB \nRev4.4.2 (Stuiver et al., 1998) and all calibrated dates are cited with a two sigma age \nrange.  Dates on marine shells are taken from Rasch (1997) and have been corrected \nfor isotopic fractionisation by normalising to a \u03b413C  = 0.0 \u2030 PDB.  \n \n5.  Field sites \n \n5.1 Upernivik \n \nA suite of moraines at the outer part of the Jakobshavns Isfjord relate to a \nrecessional position of the ice stream as it temporarily stabilised on a bedrock high to \nthe immediate south of Ilulissat (Figs. 2 and 3).  At Upernivik, mid-way along \nJakobshavns Isfjord, a bedrock ridge (Asiarmuit) of gneiss bounds the southern limit \nof the fjord.  This ridge rises 100 - 350 m a.s.l. and is breached by the Tasiussaq and \nSarqardleq fjord systems.  We selected the Upernivik site because of the abundant \nlakes that extend from present sea level to well above the marine limit.  The site \nprovides an excellent opportunity to establish the minimum age of the moraines at the \nhead of Jakobshavns Isfjord, and to determine when the ice stream retreated from \nDisko Bugt into its bedrock trough. \n \n 12\n5.2  P\u00e2kitsoq \n \nP\u00e2kitsoq is a marine inlet in northeast Disko Bugt, to the southeast of \nArveprinsen Ejland (Figs. 2 and 4).  A prominent moraine at the constriction between \nP\u00e2kitsoq and P\u00e2kitsoq ilordlia marks the outer Fjord Stade ice margin in this area \n(Weidick, 1968).  We cored one lake immediately inside, and two lakes outside of this \nmoraine.  Our sampling strategy was designed to establish a minimum age for the \nformation of the Fjord Stade moraines and, therefore, all of the sampled lakes lie close \nto the local marine limit.   \n \n6.  Results \n \n6.1  Upernivik \n \n6.1.1  The marine limit \n \nWe measured the elevation of 27 perched boulders to the south of the \nAsiarmuit bedrock ridge (ML1) (Fig. 3). The average height of the lowest ten of these \nis 41.58 m \u00b1 0.95 m.  Comparable measurements at ML2, to the north of the bedrock \nridge on Qajaa, yielded a value of 41.09 \u00b1 1.83 m.  There is, therefore, no difference \nin ML elevation on either side of the bedrock ridge. \n \n 13\n6.1.2  Lakes above the marine limit \n \nT7, 250 m a.s.l. \n \nThis lake lies 100 m below the summit of Asiarmuit.  Morainic material above \nthe lake on the summit slopes and ridge crest suggest that the lake was covered by ice \nat the last glacial maximum.  The deepest sediment sampled from this lake is a dense \ngrey silt sand (Fig. 5A).  No sediment was analysed for their diatom content since the \nlake lies well above the ML.  A 1 cm thick sediment slice from the base of the gyttja, \nbetween 876 - 875 cm, yielded an AMS age of 6910 \u00b1 40 BP (7823 - 7662 cal. yr BP, \nBeta-178170). \n \nT6, 175 m a.s.l. \n \nThis lake lies on a wide bedrock shoulder below the ridge that defines the \nsouthern margin of Jakobshavns Isfjord (Fig. 3).  A short transect of four cores show \nc. 2.5 m of gyttja overlying a dense grey silt sand (Fig. 5B).  A piston core was \ncollected from the position of core 1, and a 1 cm thick sediment slice from the base of \nthe gyttja, between 876 - 875 cm, yielded an AMS age of 6750 \u00b1 40 (7673 - 7512 cal. \nyr BP, Beta-178169).  \n \nT5, 43.32 m a.s.l. \n \nEight boreholes show a c. 1.5 m thick deposit of gyttja overlying a dense grey \nsilt sand (Fig. 5C).  Water depths increase and the thickness of gyttja thins towards \n 14\nthe centre of the lake, suggesting that some erosion of the lake sediments has \noccurred, perhaps because of stream-wash from the catchment that drains into this \nlake.  A sample core was collected from the position of core 8.  A single diatom \nsample from the lowermost grey silt sand is dominated by the freshwater taxa \nFragillaria sp.  No marine influence is present and a sample of gyttja, between 671.5-\n671 cm, yielded an AMS age of 7960 \u00b1 40 (8996-8647 cal. yr BP, Beta-178168).  \n \n6.1.3  Lakes below the marine limit \n \nT4, 31.64 m a.s.l. \n \nT4 is a small lake that lies to the southeast of the Qajaa peninsula (Fig. 3). \nSteep bedrock slopes rise to the north of the lake.  Five cores record a grey silt sand, \noverlain by a laminated silt gyttja and then a brown elastic gyttja which extends to \nlake bottom (Fig. 5D).  Diatoms from the sample core show the isolation of this lake \nfrom the sea by an up-core decline in polyhalobous and mesohalobous taxa and an \nassociated increase in frequencies of oligohalobous taxa above 920 cm (Fig. 6A).  A \nsample of gyttja from 923-922 cm yielded an AMS date of 6760 \u00b1 40 BP (7676-7513 \ncal. yr BP, Beta-178165). \n \nT3, 25.72 m a.s.l. \n \nThis large lake is located to the north of Nuuluk (Fig. 3).  No streams drain \ninto it, and an overflow discharges directly into Tasiussaq via a bedrock sill.  Two \nstratigraphic transects were completed, one of which is shown in Fig. 5E. A sample \n 15\ncore from the position of core 8 contains poly- and mesohalobous diatoms in a lower \nsilt sand, which are replaced above 791 cm by oligohalobous taxa as the lake was \nisolated from the sea (Fig. 6B).  A sample of gyttja from 792-791 cm yielded an AMS \nage of 5980 \u00b1 40 BP (6895-6677 cal. yr BP, Beta-178171). \n \nT2, 12.20 m a.s.l.  \n \nThis lake lies on a relatively flat terrace comprising extensively shattered \nbedrock (Figs. 3 and 5F).  Diatoms from the sample core record basin isolation from \nthe sea by an up-core increase in gyttja and a switch from poly- and mesohalobous \ntaxa to oligohalobous taxa (Fig. 6C).  A sample of silt gyttja between 658-657.5 cm, \nyielded an AMS age of 5060 \u00b1 40 BP (5910-5715 cal. yr BP, Beta-178166).  \n \nT1, 1.61 m a.s.l. \n \nThis low-lying lake is located a short height above the present saltmarsh.  The \nlake sill is buried by peat that coring and shallow excavations showed to comprise \nintact and fractured bedrock.  The sediment sequence (Fig. 5G) comprises a grey silt \nclay that is overlain by a 1-4 cm thick laminated black silt gyttja, which passes \nupwards into a gyttja that extends to the lake bed.  Diatoms from the sample core \nshow an abrupt up-core replacement of poly- and mesohalobous taxa by \noligohalobous taxa (Fig. 5D), something not uncommon in small, shallow lakes where \nwater mixing is rapid on lake isolation.  A 1 cm thick slice of gyttja from 292-291 cm, \nyielded an AMS age of 4150 \u00b1 40 BP (4826-4548 cal. yr BP, Beta-178167). \n \n 16\n Fig. 3.

We levelled the height of this sill with six levelling transects, \ncorrecting our measurements for the change (0.28 m) in sea-level that occurred during \nthe 61 minute period of observation using our tidal data.  The lowermost sediments in \nthe tidal inlet are a dense green silt sand with some angular pebbles, above which is a \ndark brown or black well-laminated silt gyttja, typically 10-20 cm thick, which is \noverlain by a 20-50 cm thick soft brown gyttja (Fig. 5H).  Up-core the gyttja becomes \nblack in colour and highly humified with a trace of silt, and passes into a thin (5-10 \ncm) dark grey organic-rich silt sand with some detrital organic matter.  This is, in \nturn, overlain by a brown-grey sand silt with shells, fish bones, as well as detrital \norganic matter that extends to sea bed.   \n \nWe collected a pair of overlapping piston cores from core 6 for diatom \nanalysis and radiocarbon dating.  Their diatom content clearly shows the isolation \ncontact, towards the base of the sample core, and the ingression contact, towards the \ncore top (Fig. 5E).  Two samples of gyttja were dated from 1022-1021 cm and 997-\n996 cm, yielding ages of 3540 \u00b1 40 BP (3957-3693 cal. yr BP, Beta-178172) and \n1750 \u00b1 40 BP (1812-1545 cal. yr BP, Beta-178173) respectively. \n 18\n \nFig. 4.

Six cores across the lake reveal a dense silt sand that is overlain \nby a thin grey brown silt gyttja and then a 1-2 m thick gyttja which extends to lake \nbottom (Fig. 5I).  Diatoms from the silt gyttja (not shown) in the sample core are \ndominated by Fragilaria sp. and other oligohalobous and halophobous taxa, with no \ntaxa suggesting any marine influence.

Four of the six boreholes in this lake show a dense \ngrey sand silt which passes upwards abruptly into a gyttja, typically 75 cm thick, that \nextends to the lake bottom (Fig. 5J).  There is no laminated transitional unit across the \nsilt sand to gyttja transition, as is common in lakes below the marine limit.  There are \nno diatoms in the silt, and those in the overlying gyttja (not shown) are dominated by \nfreshwater types, notably Fragilaria spp.  Thus, although this lake is very close to the \nmarine limit, the sediments sampled contain no evidence for inundation by tidal \nwaters.  A 1 cm thick sediment slice from the base of the gyttja in the sample core \nyielded an AMS age of 6113 \u00b1 121 BP (7262-6680 cal. yr BP, KIA-23027). \n \n6.2.3  Lake below the marine limit \n \nP1, 33.02 m a.s.l. \n \nP1 lies close to and slightly below P2, c. 2 m to 3 m below the local marine \nlimit (Fig. 4).  Six boreholes record a dense grey silt with variable amounts of sand \nand clay overlain by gyttja.  In core 2, a laminated silt gyttja separates these two units \n(Fig. 5K).  Diatoms in the silt are dominated by the mesohalobous taxon Scolioneis \nturmida, and those in the overlying gyttja by freshwater taxa including high \nfrequencies of Fragillaria spp. (Fig. 6F). This confirms that P1 lies below the marine \nlimit.  A 1 cm thick sediment slice from the base of the gyttja in the sample core \nyielded an AMS age of 6475 \u00b1 30 BP (7429-7319 cal. yr BP, KIA-23026). \n 24\nFig. 6.

(Continued) \n \n 26\n6.3  Upernivik: the age of the marine limit and a new RSL curve for Jakobshavns \nIsfjord \n \nThe radiocarbon ages from the three highest lakes at Upernivik (T7, T6 and \nT5) provide minimum ages for ice retreat from the bedrock ridge that defines the \nsouthern margin of Jakobshavns Isfjord, and for the separation of Jakobshavns Isbrae \nfrom the adjacent ice sheet to the south.  The date from T7 and T6 are very similar, \nand they indicate that these lakes were deglaciated after 7.8 \u2013 7.5 ka cal. yr BP.  \nHowever, the age for the onset of organic accumulation in T5 is about 1 ka cal. yrs \nolder than those from T7 and T6.  To help resolve these differences we use the RSL \ndata from the remaining lakes in this study to estimate the age of the ML.  Each basin \nrecords isolation from the sea and, when viewed together (Fig. 7), track MSL falling \nswiftly to intersect present shortly after 4.5 ka cal. yr BP.  MSL continued to fall until \nat least 3.8 ka cal. yr BP, at which time T0 was isolated from the sea.  T0 was fresh \nfor about 2 ka cal. yr BP before being flooded once more c. 1.7 ka cal. yr BP.  MSL \nfell to a minimum at Upernivik at c. 2.8 ka cal. yr BP, before rising at least 5 m to \npresent.  The switch from early and mid Holocene RSL fall to late Holocene RSL rise \nis a widespread phenomenon in Greenland associated with the onset of late Holocene \nre-growth of the ice sheet (Kelly, 1980). \n \nUpwards linear extrapolation of the RSL data from T4 at 31.64 m to T5, at \n43.32 m and just above the ML (Fig. 7), suggests that the ML here (c. 41 m a.s.l.) \ndates to c. 8.2 ka cal. yr BP.  This estimate is close in age to the basal date from T5 \njust above the ML of c. 8.8 ka cal. yr BP.  On this basis, we consider that 8.8-8.2 ka \ncal. yr BP is the best age estimate for the ML and a good approximation for the timing \n 27\nof local deglaciation at Upernivk.   \n \n7.  Discussion \n \nIn the following sections we use the compilation of radiocarbon dates from \nDisko Bugt provided by Rasch (1997), updated with our recently collected data from \nthis study and the Orpissooq area to; i) assess the age of the Fjord Stade moraines; ii) \nestimate the location of the ice sheet margin at the time of the GH-8.2 event and; iii) \nconsider the implications of this work for our understanding of the controls on ice \nsheet margin during this short-lived event. \n \n7.1  The age of the Fjord Stade moraines in Disko Bugt \n \n7.1.1  Southeast Disko Bugt \n \nThe radiocarbon ages and the RSL curve proposed from Orpissooq indicate \nthat the Fjord Stade moraine here dates to c. 8.5-7.7 ka cal. yr BP (Long and Roberts, \n2002).  The oldest date from each side of the moraine is c. 8.5 ka cal. yr BP from an \nisolation basin impounded by the Orpissooq moraine on Nuuk (7733 \u00b1 56 BP, 8598-\n8406 cal. yr BP, AA-39665), and c. 8.0 ka cal. yr BP based on shells retrieved from a \nsite inside the Fjord Stade limit at the head of Orpissooq (7210 \u00b1 170 BP, 7696-8347 \ncal. yr BP, Hel-369) (Donner and Jungner, 1975) (Fig. 8). \n \n 28\n Fig. 7.

The smoothed line is a second \norder polynomial fitted to the lakes below the marine limit. \n \n 29\n \nFig. 8. Map depicting early Holocene radiocarbon dates from the eastern portion of Disko Bugt. Data are from Rasch \n(1997) supplemented with information from Long et al. (1999), Long and Roberts (2002), Long et al. (2003) and the \npresent study. \n \n 30\n7.1.2  Central Disko Bugt \n \nAt Eqaluit (Fig. 8), a site which lies to the west of the Fjord Stade limit, shells \nat 52 m a.s.l. provide a minimum date for deglaciation of c. 8.5 ka cal. yr BP (7650 \u00b1 \n190 BP, 8977-8113 cal. yr BP, K-993) (Weidick, 1968).  A short distance to the north, \nat Tasiussaq, a sample of basal gyttja from a lake on the surface of fluvio-glacial \nsands, just inside the Fjord Stade limit, provides an age of c. 8.8 ka cal. yr BP (7850 \u00b1 \n190 BP, 9259-8215 cal. yr BP, K-987) (Tauber, 1968).  At Ilimanaq, the oldest of five \nshell dates from below 40 m of c. 9.7 ka cal. yr BP (8680 \u00b1 130 BP, 10,149-9329 cal. \nyr BP, K-2023) (Weidick, 1974).  These shells lie just to the east of the Fjord Stade \nlimit (Fig. 8).  Lastly, our RSL data from Upernivik confirm that the Fjord Stade \nmoraines to the west of this site must be older than c. 8.8-8.2 ka cal. yr BP.  Together, \nthese central Disko Bugt data show the Fjord Stade limit here dates from at least c. 9.7 \nka cal. yr BP. \n \n7.1.3  Northeast Disko Bugt \n \nOur data show from P\u00e2kitsoq (lake P1, Fig. 4) show that the Fjord Stade \nmoraine here formed before c. 7.7 ka cal. yr BP, based on the date of 6814 \u00b1 38 BP \n(7720-7581 cal. yr BP, KIA23028).  Further north, two shell samples from Equip \nSermia and Qapiarfiit (Fig. 8) inside the Fjord Stade limit, yield dates of c. 7.3 ka cal. \nyr BP (6420 \u00b1 110 BP, 7566-7030 cal. yr BP, K6373) (Rasch, 1997) and c. 8.4 ka cal. \nyr BP (7600 \u00b1 110 BP, 8601-8170 cal. yr BP, K3663) (B\u00f6cher and Fredskild, 1993) \nrespectively.     \n \n 31\nThe chronology from each of the three areas discussed above indicates that the \nFjord Stade moraines in Disko Bugt are diachronous and do not record a distinct ice \nmargin response to the GH-8.2 event.  However, because the number of radiocarbon \ndates is low, especially in the northeast of the study area, and most were collected for \nother purposes than dating these moraines, we now use RSL and marine limit data to \nexplore further the age of these moraines. \n \n7.1.4 Relative sea-level changes and the Fjord Stade moraines in Disko Bugt \n \nThe new RSL graph from Upernivik is complementary to that developed \npreviously from the Orpissooq area (Fig. 9).  However, the marine limit varies \nsignificantly along the eastern shores of the bay, with a maximum elevation of >100 \nm a.s.l. in outer coastal areas but dropping steeply to between 60 m and 40 m a.s.l. \nacross the Fjord Stade moraines (Rasch, 2000; Long and Roberts, 2002).  This steep \ndrop in ML elevation provides strong evidence that the ice sheet slowed in its retreat \n(or paused, or even readvanced) as the ice sheet reached the eastern shores of Disko \nBugt.  Because the RSL histories between areas in east Disko Bugt are broadly \nsimilar, we can use variations in the height of the ML as an indicator of the relative \ntiming of local deglaciation.  A further test of the age of these moraines is therefore \npossible by examining the elevation of the ML at sites where the Fjord Stade \nmoraines intersect the coast; if the moraines are similar in age, then their associated \nmarine limits should also be similar. \n \n 32\n \nFig. 9. Relative sea level graph from Upernivik, Orpissooq and Pa\u02c6 kitsoq. X and Y axis errors are as for Fig. 7. Only \ndates from isolation basins are shown. The shaded area covers the period of the GH-8.2 event. \n \nThe elevation of the marine limit in east Disko Bugt is shown in Fig. 10.  This \nis based on the review by Rasch (2000), modified and supplemented by our \n 33\nobservations at Orpissooq (Long and Roberts, 2002), Upernivik, P\u00e2kitsoq and \nArveprinsen Ejland (Long et al., 1999).  According to Rasch (2000), typical height \nuncertainties associated with the observations he reports are \u00b1 5 m.  This map shows \nthat the height of the marine limit varies significantly with respect to the Fjord Stade \nmoraines.  In southeast Disko Bugt, the marine limit at the Fjord Stade moraine is \nrelatively low at c. 54 m a.s.l.  Further north, in the Ilulissat area, the marine limit is \nhigher, at c. 94 m a.s.l. immediately west of the Fjord Stade moraines.  At the \nP\u00e2kitsoq study site, the limit is between 36 m and 40 m a.s.l.  These spatial variations \nare comparable with the suggested diachroneity of the Fjord Stade moraines discussed \nabove and support an age model in which ice retreated from central Disko Bugt ahead \nof ice to the north and south of the bay. \n \nThe spatial variations in marine limit elevation shown in Fig. 10 show that the \nlimit is at its highest at sites adjacent to major fjord mouths.  Thus, high limits occur \nto the north of Arveprinsens Eijland, where ice would have drained via Torssukatak \ninto Vaigat, and also in the south of the island at the mouth of At\u00e2 Sund.  High limits \nalso occur at Qasigiannguit and at the entrance to Lakesebugt.  Some of these height \ndifferences may reflect variations in wind\/wave exposure, but the overall height range \nof the marine limit associated with the Fjord Stade moraines (54 m to 94 m a.s.l.) \nmust reflect real differences in their age.  These differences suggest that, as with \nJakobshavns Isbrae, the mouths of these major fjords became ice free well before their \nintervening interfluve areas. \n 34\n \nFig. 10. The marine limit in eastern Disko Bugt based on Rasch (2000), Long et al. (1999), Long and Roberts (2003) \nand this study. Elevations are in metres above mean sea level. Typical height errors are75m (Rasch, 2000). \n 35\n \n7.2 The location of the ice sheet margin at the time of the GH-8.2 event  \n \nIn Section 7.1.3 we rejected the hypothesis that the Fjord Stade moraines \nrecord a GH-8.2 event ice margin.  However, it should be possible, given our \nknowledge of the RSL history of the area (Fig. 9) and the elevation of the marine limit \n(Fig. 10) to estimate the general location of the ice sheet margin at the time of this \nevent.  We see from the former that the age of the GH-8.2 event (defined as between \n8.4 and 8.0 ka cal. yr BP) relates to a MSL elevation of between c. 45 and 55 m a.s.l.  \nThus, those sites with a marine limit above 55 m probably lay outside the ice margin \nat the time of the GH-8.2 event.  Figure 10 demonstrates that marine limits in this \nheight range are entirely restricted to the inner parts of the fjords in east Disko Bugt.  \nIn all instances the ice sheet margin at the time of the GH-8.2 event was at or inside \n(i.e. east of) the outer limit of the Fjord Stade moraines.   \n \n7.3 Controls on ice sheet dynamics at the time of the GH-8.2 event \n \nAs noted above, the GH-8.2 event was associated with an initial, probably \nsub-decadal, abrupt drop in air temperatures and snow accumulation over the centre \nof the Greenland Ice Sheet.  This was followed by a one to two century period of \nrecovery to near pre-event conditions.  In a recent review of this event, Alley and \n\u00c1g\u00fastsd\u00f3ttir (2005) note that glaciers in several parts of the northern hemisphere, \nincluding Scandanavia (Dahl and Nesje, 1994; Nesje et al., 2001; Seierstad et al., \n2002), Alaska (Denton and Karl\u00e9n, 1973) and coastal British Colombia (Menounes et \nal., 2004) all experienced short-lived advances at this time.  Why then, is there no \nobvious marginal response of the GIS in Disko Bugt to this event? \n 36\n  One possibility is that the magnitude of the event was simply too short-\nlived to reverse the trend of early Holocene ice margin retreat and mass balance loss.  \nDuring the run-up to the GH-8.2 event, the GIS as a whole was experiencing a \nsignificant mass balance deficit driven by the warmer temperatures of the thermal \nmaximum (Kaufman et al., 2004) as well as significant ice loss via calving.  In Disko \nBugt, the ice sheet margin had retreated from the outer coast to Ilulissat at an average \nrate of c. 110 m yr-1, based on minimum ages for deglaciation from the outer and \ninner parts of the bay (Long and Roberts, 2002).  This rapid retreat agrees with the \npattern of modelled ice volume loss from Greenland during the early Holocene by \nTarasov and Peltier (2002).  In the S\u00f8ndre Str\u00f8mfjord area, for example, their GrB \nmodel predicts ice thinning from 1100 m to 400 m between 10 and 8 ka cal. yr BP and \na reduction in ice volume of the entire ice sheet from c. 0.4 to <0.3 1016 m3.  Against \nthis trend, it appears that the GH-8.2 event was simply too short-lived to have a major \nimpact on ice margin retreat.    \n \nThe absence of a well-defined ice margin response to the GH-8.2 event may \nalso be because much of the ice margin at this time was loosing mass to the ocean via \ncalving.  As discussed above, at this time the lowland ice margin in Disko Bugt was \nnested in a series of topographically restricted fjords (Warren and Hulton, 1990; \nRoberts and Long, 2005).  In these settings ice discharge would have been strongly \ncontrolled by calving, a process that is in general more closely linked to water depth \nand fjord topography than climate (Pelto et al., 1989; Pelto and Warren, 1990; Long \nand Roberts, 2003). \n \n 37\nThese considerations emphasise the importance of the magnitude and duration \nof the event, antecedent mass balance history, and the significance of topographic \nsetting in controlling ice sheet response to short-lived climate events.  The discussion \nalso highlights a strong geographical sampling bias in our work, and that of others \nworking on the margins of marine-based ice sheets.  By relying on data from coastal \nsettings we have elected to construct an ice sheet chronology from environments that \nare known to be sensitive to non-climatic factors.  Indeed, one of the original \narguments Weidick (1968) uses for a climate origin of the Fjord Stade moraines is \ntheir continuity across interfluve areas where topographic controls can be less \nobvious.  Therefore, an important challenge for those interested in examining ice \nsheet response to short lived climatic events is to map and date ice margin deposits in \nsettings where such topographic controls are minimised. \n \n8.  Conclusions  \n \nThis paper addresses the dynamics of the Greenland Ice Sheet during the early \nHolocene, including the interval of the GH-8.2 event.  Using new data from two field \nsites at Upernivik and P\u00e2kitsoq, together with previously published data from Disko \nBugt, we test the hypothesis that a suite of early Holocene moraines (the Fjord Stade \nmoraines (Weidick, 1968)) record an ice margin response to the GH-8.2 event.   \n \nA new RSL curve from Upernivik, a site located in central Disko Bugt mid-\nway along Jakobshavns Isfjord, tracks relative sea level falling from the marine limit \n(c. 43 m a.s.l) to present sea level between c. 8.8-8.0 and 4.5 ka cal. yr BP.  Relative \nsea level continued to fall until c. 2.8 ka cal yr BP, after which it rose by c. 5 m to \n 38\npresent.   This record demonstrates that Jakobshavns Isbrae had retreated inland from \na calving margin at the mouth of Jakobshavns Isfjord by c. 8.8 ka cal. yr BP. \n \nA review of early Holocene radiocarbon dates from Disko Bugt suggests that \nthe Fjord Stade moraines are 1-2 ka cal. yrs older in the Jakobshavns Isbrae part of the \nbay compared with areas to the north and south.  Thus, during the early Holocene \nJakobshavns Isbrae retreated inland ahead of the remainder of the ice sheet margin in \nDisko Bugt.  The general trend of the Upernivik RSL data is similar to that previously \nreported from elsewhere within Disko Bugt.  Accordingly, we approximate the timing \nof local deglaciation and, by extrapolation, the age of the Fjord Stade moraines by \nexamining the age and elevation of the marine limit across the study area.  The \nhighest marine limits (c. 100 m a.s.l.) occur at the mouths of the major fjords that \ndrain into the eastern part of Disko Bugt.  These areas became ice free first during the \nearly Holocene.  In general, marine limits are lower in southeast and northeast Disko \nBugt compared with those in the centre of the bay near Jakobshavns Isfjord.  This \nprovides further support for the hypothesis that the oldest Fjord Stade moraines occur \nin the central part of Disko Bugt. \n \nWe are unable, based on the data presented in this paper, to resolve a distinct \nice sheet margin response to the GH-8.2 event in Disko Bugt.  There is no clearly \nidentifiable set of glacial landforms from this period that can be traced on \ngeomorphological or chronological grounds across the study area.   \n \nAcknowledgements \n \n 39\nWe gratefully acknowledge the support of the Arctic Station and the Danish \nPolar Center, University of Copenhagen, in the completion of this research.
