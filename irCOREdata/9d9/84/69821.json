We found it hard to believe that any social constructionist researchers \nin developmental psychology would be sufficiently courageous (or perhaps foolhardy) to submit \ntheir work to a journal that has no track record of publishing social constructionist work. Nor \ncould we believe that the journal had been sufficiently courageous to publish the article and \nbegin what may prove to be a process of broadening its scope in a significant and challenging \nway. Hence, before we offer any reflections on the content of the article, we must commend \nboth Korobov and Bamberg and the journal.  \nThe article appears at a very appropriate time, when social constructionist work has \nmoved beyond the social psychological realm in which it first appeared in British psychology \nand has begun to feature regularly in British Psychological Society journals devoted to other \ndomains such as health psychology and psychotherapeutic and counselling psychology. The \nappearance of Korobov and Bamberg\u2019s article in the journal that lies at the heart of British \ndevelopmental psychology is a significant and welcome move as it may introduce the radical \npotential of social constructionist work to a new audience of psychologists (although, of course, \n 2 \nsome developmentalists have already used social constructionist approaches in creative ways to \nshed new light on developmental psychology as a discipline \u2013 see Burman, 1994 \u2013 and, more \nspecifically, on masculinities in youth, for example \u2013 see the work of Frosh et al., 2002, 2003, \nand the resistance it engendered from Archer, 2004). \nFor those who are not familiar with social constructionism and its outworking in \ndiscursive research, Korobov and Bamberg provide a helpful synopsis in the early part of their \narticle. However, it is important to point out that they tell only part of the story of social \nconstructionist research in British psychology. The social constructionist approach that they \nfocus on in their article is very much a discursive psychology approach with its characteristic \nmicro-level attention to text (Edwards & Potter, 1992). However, there is another strand which \nis sometimes termed \u2018Foucauldian discourse analysis\u2019. This is concerned with the availability of \ndiscursive resources within a culture (and the implications for those living within that culture), \nthe role of discourse in wider social processes of legitimation and power and the relationship \nbetween discourses and institutional structures and practices (Willig, 2001). There have been \ncalls for a more consistent integration of these approaches (see Coyle, 2000, and Wetherell, \n1998, for example) and, given the many potentially rich ideological seams that could be mined \nin the data extracts in Korobov and Bamberg\u2019s article, it would have been good to see such an \napproach adopted here. However, it would be unfair to criticise their work on these grounds \nbecause such an analysis was not their aim, especially when we believe that there are much more \nsignificant grounds on which we can critique the analysis on its own terms. \nBefore we offer our critique, it is worth pointing out to those who are unfamiliar with \nqualitative research that one of the principal criteria by which a qualitative analysis is evaluated \nis its persuasiveness (although different authors use different terms for this criterion such as \n\u2018grounding in examples\u2019 \u2013 Elliott et al., 1999 \u2013 and \u2018transparency\u2019 \u2013 Yardley, 2000). In order to \n 3 \nappear persuasive, all interpretations need to be grounded in the data. Clearly what constitutes a \ncredible interpretation of data will vary from one evaluator to another. However, analysts should \nillustrate their core analytic contentions with data in such a way as to persuade most evaluators. \nBy presenting extracts from their data set, researchers allow readers to assess their \ninterpretations and, if they disagree with these, to offer interpretations of their own. In our \ncommentary, we will illustrate this process by taking issue with one of Korobov and Bamberg\u2019s \ncore contentions in their analysis of how a group of adolescent males \u2018did maturity\u2019 in focus \ngroup talk. We will offer alternative interpretations that we consider to be more persuasive. \nReaders can decide for themselves which readings appear more credible. Note that social \nconstructionist work does not assume that a definitive, \u2018true\u2019 analysis is ever attainable: what we \noffer is our reading of the data in response to Korobov and Bamberg\u2019s reading of the data, \ninformed by our \u2018speaking positions\u2019 as male social psychologists who are experienced in \ndiscursive research (and undoubtedly by other speaking positions that we routinely adopt too). \nThe main problem we have with Korobov and Bamberg\u2019s analysis is that their \ninterpretations of their focus group excerpts in terms of \u2018doing maturity\u2019 are not adequately \ngrounded in the data and so are seldom persuasive. The invocation of \u2018maturity\u2019 is rarely \nnecessary in making sense of the data. \u2018Maturity\u2019 seems to be a dimension that is sometimes \nimposed on the interactions by the focus group moderator (the only excerpt in which \u2018maturity\u2019 \nis invoked by the adolescent speakers is excerpt 1, where they orient to the construct only after it \nhas been invoked by the moderator) and is regularly imposed on the analysis by Korobov and \nBamberg. Of course, we acknowledge that, in their introduction, the authors ground the analysis \nin existing developmental literature on maturity and, based upon this literature, particularly \nEckert\u2019s (1994) work, they provide definitions of what \u2018maturity\u2019 might look like at a discursive \nlevel. It is said to be constituted by the negotiation of movement between or the negotiation of \n 4 \npositions relative to two identifiable discourses, \u2018normative asexuality\u2019 and \u2018normative \nheterosexuality\u2019, evidenced by orientations to \u2018the features of \u201cheterosexual desire\u201d (so as to \nappear \u201ccool\u201d or \u201cnot gay\u201d), but in ways that fight shy of appearing shallow, sexist, ignorant or \ndesperate\u2019. This definition is qualified through their contention that the simultaneous \nperformance of \u2018maturity\u2019 and \u2018normative heterosexuality\u2019 is \u2018an evasive, inscrutable, and \ninsinuatingly strategic project\u2019. In the terms provided by these narrow and broad definitions, \nKorobov and Bamberg\u2019s claims to have identified the discursive performance of \u2018maturity\u2019 \nappear warranted. However, the adoption of a critical and radical methodology also requires a \ncritical reappraisal of the topic of interest and of the existing relevant literature. As we will \ndemonstrate, the uncritical imposition of an existing interpretative framework can result in \ninterpretations that do not reflect the concerns of the speakers so much as the concerns of the \nanalysts. \nDue to space constraints, we will focus on one data excerpt in detail here but will \nconsider others in more general terms. Just before excerpt 2, the authors state that \u2018Although \nmaturity is not explicitly mentioned, the boys defend against the charge that they are habitually \n\u201cinvading\u201d the girls\u2019 privacy, which is hearable as a general index of immaturity\u2019. There is no \nevidence to suggest that the adolescent males in the discussion orient to the reported action \n(going \u2018into a girls\u2019 bathroom and [ ] a girls\u2019 locker room\u2019) as invading girls\u2019 privacy except \nwhen prompted to do so by the moderator in line 7. The contention that the aforementioned \ncharge is hearable as an index of immaturity applies primarily to the analysts. If the moderator \nwas one of the analysts, then we can say that not only do the analysts identify what can be taken \nas evidence of maturity but one of them was actively engaged in producing that evidence. We \ncontend that, among other things, what is being negotiated in this excerpt is not maturity but the \nrelative moral standing of \u2018guys\u2019 and \u2018girls\u2019 through a particular focus on sexuality. Young \n 5 \nwomen are constructed as equivalent sexual beings to young men, even to the point where they \nmight be considered \u2018perverted\u2019 (\u2018perverted\u2019 being one speaker\u2019s reconstruction of the \nmoderator\u2019s charge that the adolescent males might gain sexual pleasure from entering female \ntoilets or locker rooms). The adolescent speakers account for their heterosexual desire by \nconstructing it as normative and by evidencing its normativity through constructing young \nwomen as equivalently heterosexually motivated beings (lines 13-18): young women are \nconstructed as being as interested in young men as these young men report being interested in \nyoung women. Heterosexuality is constructed and accomplished within a normative model of \ngender categories and heterosexual desire: it is all rendered as perfectly natural. There is no \ninvocation of a temporal dimension in negotiating subject positions in this excerpt and it is this \nthat we would accept as the most convincing evidence in favour of an analysis in terms of \n\u2018maturity\u2019. How can maturity, which must surely be conceived as a process or, at very least, as a \ndialectic between immaturity and maturity, be said to be done when there is no temporal \ndimension along which either the accomplishment of the self or the construction of categories \nmight be arranged? Whilst there was potential for \u2018maturity\u2019 to be negotiated between the \u2018guys\u2019 \nand the \u2018girls\u2019, the comparison of these categories is used by speakers only to develop the \naccount of equivalent heterosexual desire. So does the analysis ever speak about \u2018maturity\u2019 in a \nway that we would see as persuasive? We contend that Hal\u2019s first turn in excerpt 3 contains \nevidence that his concern is \u2018maturity\u2019 as a process. Here \u2018maturity\u2019 is being done through \npositioning the self in terms of an experienced, and therefore relatively mature, heterosexuality. \nThis contention can be supported by pointing to the constructed sense of temporal progression \napparent in \u2018go through a certain number of girls\u2019, \u2018growing up\u2019 and \u2018if they\u2019ve [ ] went through \nthat\u2019. \nWe take issue with other invocations of \u2018maturity\u2019 in the analysis of excerpt 2. The \n 6 \nauthors argue that the moderator\u2019s turns at lines 4, 7, 12 and 16 are \u2018soft challenges [ ] that \nconstruct the boys as potentially immature\u2019. There is nothing in these turns or in the content of \nthe speakers\u2019 responses to them that supports this contention. They are not oriented to as charges \nof immaturity so much as charges of unacceptable forms of heterosexual interest in young \nwomen in young women\u2019s spaces. Likewise, the claim that the scripting of the adolescent males\u2019 \nreported actions as \u2018potentially reoccurring or habitual [ ] can be heard as dispositional \nimmaturity\u2019 is not supported by the content of the males\u2019 turns: even if it is hearable as such, the \nadolescent males do not orient to this hearing. Although we agree with Korobov and Bamberg\u2019s \nbasic reading of excerpt 2 in terms of the performance of normative heterosexuality, we \nseriously take issue with their linking of the excerpt to \u2018maturity\u2019 in a way that is not grounded \nin the data or at least not in the adolescent males\u2019 concerns and categories (and note that we are \nnot advocating some sort of phenomenological take on discursive work here). In our reading of \nthe excerpt, accountability is the participants\u2019 concern, not maturity (Shotter, 1984).  \nWe would also question the analyses of \u2018maturity\u2019 in excerpts 4 and 5. In their analysis \nof excerpt 4, the authors conclude that the use of concessive repair devices allows the speakers \nsimultaneously to occupy two subject positions \u2013 as sexually interested and as knowing and in \ncontrol. This second subject position is argued as constituting the performance of \u2018maturity\u2019 but \nwe do not see this as a necessary or persuasive interpretation. An alternative interpretation \nwould be to argue that the simultaneous positioning as sexually interested, knowing and in \ncontrol constitutes a particular accomplishment of masculinity. An interpretation of this \nmasculinity as itself mature would require the imposition of an interpretative framework within \nwhich versions of heterosexual masculinity might be organized in terms of their relative \nmaturity on the strength of their constitutive \u2018attributes\u2019. In the analysis of excerpt 5, appearing \n\u2018calm and confident when asking a girl out\u2019 is contrasted with an \u2018obvious and desperate \n 7 \ninfatuation\u2019 and is argued to be \u2018part of the doing of maturity for them\u2019. But is it necessary to \nconclude that this sort of \u2018doing cool\u2019 is constitutive of the performance of maturity rather than \nbeing an end in itself? There is a social and cultural value in \u2018doing cool\u2019 that is not necessarily \nthe same as that which might be associated with \u2018doing mature\u2019. The overarching interest in \n\u2018maturity\u2019 in this article results in preferred subject positions and the resistance of dispreferred \nsubject positions being interpreted as maturity purely on the strength of the assumption that \nmaturity is valued and therefore, since these positions are valued, they must constitute maturity. \nIn the \u2018Discussion\u2019 section, Korobov and Bamberg make the important point that \u2018The \nvalue of a discursive analysis is that it reveals that it is precisely the sensitive orientations, and \nthe work done to preempt and deflect possible counters to the hearable trouble in such \norientations, that matter most for the boys as they work to position themselves\u2019 (emphasis in \noriginal). However, it is unfortunate that their analysis lacks sensitivity to the precision of the \nboys\u2019 negotiation of subject positions. Perhaps if Korobov and Bamberg were not so concerned \nwith accounting for their own interest in how adolescent males \u2018do maturity\u2019, they might have \nbeen able to develop a richer analysis, one that did justice to the complexity and subtlety of \ndiscursive resources and strategies drawn upon by these young men in the negotiation of a great \ndeal more than \u2018maturity\u2019. If any overarching framework could or should be applied to these \ndata, then it should be a concern with masculinity, within which a concern with maturity would \nbe just one minor part. The excerpts presented in this article demonstrate the participants\u2019 \nconcern with, above all else, the performance of normative heterosexual masculinity. What that \nmight be is evident in the preferred positions taken up by the speakers across the excerpts. It is \nconstituted by a \u2018normal\u2019 level of heterosexual desire and interest, by a certain level of \nexperience, by the exercise of rationality and reason, by not being \u2018desperate\u2019, by \nacknowledging the importance of appearance and character and by an engagement with and \n 8 \ninvolvement in a process of change and development. Whilst this argument undeniably involves \nthe imposition of another interpretative framework, such an imposition is at least supported by \nthe content of the adolescent male speakers\u2019 turns. In their final sentence, the authors claim that \na discursive approach to the examination of \u2018maturity\u2019 and young men \u2018would reveal what \ncounts as maturity from their perspective\u2019 (emphasis in original). It is strange then that they \nwere not able to see that, in their analysis, \u2018maturity\u2019 is the analysts' concern \u2013 part of an \ninterpretative framework derived from existing literature on maturation, sexuality and gender \u2013 \nimposed upon the data and very rarely oriented to unprompted by the young men themselves. \nWe hope that, in challenging the central contention in Korobov and Bamberg\u2019s analysis, \nwe have alerted readers to one of the major analytic pitfalls that might be encountered when \ndoing discursive work (and indeed, when doing any sort of qualitative research) \u2013 that data may \nbe squeezed into the researchers\u2019 analytic concerns even though they do not readily fit those \nconcerns. Analysts should be eternally mindful of the influence of their speaking positions on \ntheir readings of data, endeavour to explore as wide a range of alternative interpretations as \npossible and ensure that their chosen analysis is adequately evidenced by their data. We also \nhope that, through the commentaries on Korobov and Bamberg\u2019s work, readers will obtain some \ninsight into how the value of any analysis can be worked out in a dynamic way through the \nadvancing of interpretations and their contestation by others, whether that be within research \nteams, between researchers and reviewers or in the formal exchange of viewpoints seen here.  \n \nReferences \nArcher, J.
