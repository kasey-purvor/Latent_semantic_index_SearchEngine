With 99% of businesses\nclassified as small and medium-sized tourist enterprises (SMTEs) in Europe, SMTEs\nwhen grouped together collectively have a considerable influence on both national\nand European economies and particularly within the tourism and hospitality industry\n(European Commission, 2003 and Buhalis, 1998, 1999). Hence, greater\nconsideration should be given to SMTEs to help them be innovative, adopt systems\nthat will allow them to explore their potential. In order to achieve this SMTEs need to\nmaintain and understand the importance of utilising (new) Information and\ncommunication technologies (ICTs) dynamically.\nIn particular, SMTEs need to realise that ICTs can be used for not only for\noperational purposes but for tactical and strategic management too (Main, 2002).\nThis can help to empower SMTEs to communicate directly and more efficiently with\nprospective customers and suppliers as well as to achieve economies of scale.\nEconomies of scope can also be acquired through increased knowledge of internal\norganisational capabilities. Therefore ICT training in the hospitality industry is\nconsidered essential if SMTEs are to increase their organisational efficiency.\nTherefore it should become a priority for SMTE managers to incorporate training into\ntheir overall strategy (Sigala et al, 2001). Online learning (eLearning) systems can\nhelp to deliver ICT training to SMTEs, giving them the opportunity to gain the core\nskills and competencies that are critical for SMTEs to remain or to become more\ncompetitive in the eMarketplace.\nThis paper investigates SMTEs in the European Hotel sector and their utilisation of\nthe Internet and their perception on online learning systems. The paper also aims to\ndemonstrate to SMTEs that training is imperative and that ICTs can enable them to\nimprove their inventory management, strengthen their marketing and\ncommunications strategies and develop their internal business processes. The\npaper demonstrates that a course on ICT skills can assist SMTEs to further their\ndevelopment.\nICTs and SMTEs\nThe advent of the Internet in the late 1990\u2019s has had a strong impact on the tourism\nand hospitality industry (Buhalis, 2003). It is due to the fragmentation of the hotel\nindustry, which makes the Internet ideal for selling inventory online. The Internet as a\nchannel of distribution has become one of the most successful channels used by\nconsumers to research travel options, compare prices and make reservations for\nairline tickets, hotel rooms and car rental. Therefore, the provision of online travel\nservices is the single most successful Business-to-Consumer (B2C) segment on the\nInternet (Lauden & Traver, 2002). Research carried out by Forrester Research\n(2002) and PhoCusWright (2003) has indicated that the overall percentage of hotel\nrooms booked online will grow from an estimated 9% in 2002 to 20% in 2005.\nMoreover the Internet is also having a profound effect on the internal and external\noperating procedures within the hospitality industry (Cheng and Piccoli, 2002).\nMost large hotel organisations have moderate integration of daily operations and\nhave implemented websites, Intranets and extranets in order to reduce costs;\nimprove communications internally and externally and to develop alternative\ndistribution channels. Cline (2001) and O\u2019Connor & Frew (2000) also identified that\nhospitality organisations develop ICTs to access new customers on a global basis\nand to be able to streamline operating procedures. Integrating daily operations such\nas sales, marketing and distribution as well as aggregating demand to drive down\nprices on the procurement side are some of the major benefits of the Internet. With\nSMTEs still under-represented in Global Distribution Systems (GDSs) and with over\n85% of European Hoteliers not listed on GDSs, this has become a severe limitation\nfor SMTEs as GDS serve more than 50,000 travel agents worldwide (Werthner &\nKlein, 1999). Albeit if SMTEs utilise the Internet as their main distribution channel,\nthen it can enable them to overcome their challenge of being globally represented\nand they can develop their virtual site at minimal cost.\nMorrision & Thomas (1999), have also implied that the application of ICTs by SMTEs\ncan help them to overcome the management issues that often confronts these small\nbusinesses. Main (2002) has demonstrated that integrating technology into the\nbusiness process and operating in an eBusiness environment can offer SMTEs many\nadvantages in operational, tactical and strategic management. More importantly\nMutch (1998) has highlighted that SMTEs need to ensure that the technology\nimplemented is appropriate to the needs and management of their business, as too\noften this has not been the case.\nDespite all of the benefits to be achieved, the Internet and new technologies have\nfailed to make a major impact on the majority of the SMTEs in the hospitality industry.\nSMTEs have been slow to adopt and to realise the actual benefits of applying ICT to\ntheir business (Standing et al, 1999, Buhalis, 2003 and Morrison et al, 1999).\nHowever, according to Anckar and Walden (2001) there is evidence that there are\nsmall minorities of SMTEs that are taking full advantage of the electronic marketplace\nand who are benefiting from the many opportunities that it provides. This in turn\nsends out a warning signal to hoteliers who have yet to have an online presence and\nurges them to use the Internet as a mainstream distribution channel and to integrate\nweb-enabling technologies into their daily business process. Otherwise SMTEs will\nlose out in maximising both their performance and profitability in the long term.\nCharacteristics associated with SMTEs are blamed for the inertia in SMTEs in\nembracing the Internet and other web enabled technologies. These barriers have\nbeen identified by Buhalis and Main (1998), Main (2002) Braun (2002) and Moran,\n2002, as lack of IT skills and financial resources; insufficient marketing skills;\nreluctance to move away from manual processes; and inadequate bargaining power\nwithin traditional distribution channels. However, Louvieris & Lockwood (2002) and\nSigala et al (2001) have indicated that the impact of the Internet and its associated\ntechnologies may also point SMTEs towards the innovative use of eLearning\nsystems, in which learning can be facilitated where it may not have been possible to\ndo so before. This may be due to the increased ownership of technology and Internet\naccess within SMTEs, therefore enabling SMTEs to participate in online learning.\nThese online learning systems may well help SMTEs to overcome the barriers in\nembracing new technologies and integrating them into their business practices.\neLearning\nThe digital revolution has placed great emphasis on innovation, new business\nmodels, new ways of organising work as well as having a significant impact on the\nlearning industry (Schertler & Dierich, 2001, Piccoli et al 2001). According to\nBusiness Week (1999), online learning is expected to grow more than 900% between\n1999 and 2003. eLearning or online learning is defined as the creation and\ndistribution of organisational knowledge through the online delivery of information,\ncommunication, education, and training (Wild, Griggs & Downing, 2002) which opens\nthe door to a learning revolution that could help to create unprecedented\nopportunities within SMTEs. One of the key reasons for the growth in the online\nlearning is due to the fact it is far cheaper than sending employees away from the\nworkplace to a professional training course.`\nElectronic Learning or eLearning as it is commonly called is defined as learning that\ntakes place anytime someone uses electronic means for gathering information; that\u2019s\nacquired without another live person present (Zhang & Nunamaker, 2003). However,\neLearning is not just about using web-based technologies or distance learning but it\nis a way in which individuals or organisations exchange information and gain\nknowledge. It can include a wide range of learning strategies and technologies from\ncourses available online, CD-ROMs, DVDs to videoconferencing (Sigala, 2002).\neLearning can be synchronous or live, as in the case of Internet conferences, in\nwhich geographically separated teachers and students can gather in an online\nclassroom. For the purpose of this paper, eLearning is technology- enabled learning\ndesigned to be run over the Internet. The advantages and disadvantages of\neLearning are illustrated in Table 1. It is also valuable to the hotel industry because\nof the high employee turnover rates associated with the industry. Therefore, ongoing\ntraining (via online learning systems) is critical for managers, supervisors and front of\nhouse employees of small hotels.\nSMTEs can participate in online learning environments, which are designed as\ntutorial systems over the Internet. This can enhance learning, thus allowing\nmanagers and employees the ability to apply knowledge and skills that otherwise\nthey would have been unable to do in an offline environment, because of the costs\ninvolved. The time constraints and workload of managers of SMTEs frequently\nprevents them from attending training sessions during their working hours. Therefore\nthe prospect of flexible-location, cost-effective and time-independent learning\nenvironments may encourage them to participate more in training sessions via online\nlearning systems (Steppi, 1989). Enabling SMTEs to acquire new ways in which to\nmanage knowledge and information can assist them to achieve competitive\nadvantage due to their skills, competencies and knowledge SMTEs can gain through\nthis virtual learning process. Hence eLearning enhances intellectual capital of\nSMTEs and prepares them to compete in today\u2019s dynamically shifting market.\nSMTEs that are not represented in the electronic marketplace will fail to reach new\ncustomers and suffer competitive disadvantages (Buhalis and Main, 1998).\nThe tourism and hospitality industry have been identified as an industry with one of\nthe highest levels of skill shortages and staff turnover (HEFCE, 1998). Likewise\nBoisevert (2000) has identified training as a critical success factor for the hospitality\nindustry, but it is considered expensive and time consuming. As 90% of the\naccommodation businesses in the hospitality industry are SMTEs, they may find it\nincreasingly difficult to participate in any type of professional learning for numerous\nreasons (Buhalis, 1999). One of the major barriers for SMTEs is the lack of financial\nresources available for training purposes and their high degree of concentration on\ntheir operational management. SMTEs also consider training to be a cost rather than\nan investment, so little attention is given to any type of training (International Labour\nComment [MS1]: \nOrganisation, 1997). However, if SMTEs realise that training can influence the skill;\nenhance the local economy and reduce high staff turnover rates; then they might\ntake it more seriously and be willing to invest in training (Bradley and Taylor, 1996).\nThis may explain why in Europe, the provision of training to SMTEs has become a\ncentral issue of economic policy and why over the last decade the provision of\ntraining and support to SMTEs to participate in training has increased considerably\n(European Commission, 2003 and Jameson, 2000).\nTable 1 Advantages and disadvantages of eLearning\nADVANTAGES DISADVANTAGES\nThe technology offers the opportunity\nto integrate learning with work\nInitial set up and running costs or\npurchasing access to commercial\nsystems can be high\nEnhances employee performance in a\ndynamic, interactive and measurable\nway.\nAn infrastructure needs to be in place for\nemployees to use the system\nProvides information instantaneously Bandwidth limitations \u2013 high speed\ninternet access is required.

However this may depend on\nthe nature and content of the course\nHorton (2000)\nEliminates the need to create and print\nbulky manuals, which become obsolete\nafter being distributed.\nLearning is impersonal and limited\ninteraction with tutor\nMostly modular based, employees can\ndedicate shorter time periods over a\nnumber of days or weeks and still learn\nthe required information\nTutor does not take sufficient feedback\nfrom students and hence limited\ndiagnostics of learning\nAdditional material is easily accessible\nonline\nStudent requires high degree of self-\ndiscipline\nSome courses linked to professional\nand academic qualifications\nAllows the employee to learn at his\/her\nown pace in the style of learning that\nworks best for them.\nAbility to retain more information\n(Employees can retain 30% more\ninformation from an eLearning platform\ncompared to 10% retained if learning in\nthe traditional way.\nHowever, despite the benefits associated with eLearning, some industry experts and\neLearning providers do not see eLearning as a viable platform for training for all skills\nor as a replacement for traditional training (Van Hoof & Combrink, 1998). Hence,\nCheng & Piccoli (2002) have also suggested that on the job and face to face training\nare important particularly in teaching \u2018soft skills\u2019 such as management or technical\nskills, where eLearning is not suitable. Moreover Braun (2002) has identified that\nSMTEs are still not committed to online training and integrating new technologies to\nadd value and competitive advantage because they not consider it a priority at\npresent. .\nMethodology of the Study\nThis paper is based on a project funded by the European Commission - SMART-UP.\nwhich was designed to help European SMTEs in tourism and hospitality to increase\ntheir know-how and ICT literacy through the provision of specific tourism related\nmodules via an Internet based learning platform and to apply ICT applications to stay\non the leading edge of learning technology. It was also aimed to encourage SMTEs\nto work with up to date ICT and management practices. Other aims of the project\nwere to identify the skills and requirements of SMTEs to ensure that the eLearning\ncontent modules corresponded with their needs. Based on these requirements,\nSiemens and Sigma were then able to compile the technical and content user\nrequirement specifications in conjunction with the potential system users (SMTEs).\nTest cases were also generated according to user requirements in order to\nensure\/prove that the online learning system was in line with what the SMTEs\nspecified. The scope of the research was to target small and medium-sized hotels\n(SMTEs) in Austria, Ireland, Great Britain and Switzerland. It investigated their usage\nof the Internet and their perception of online learning to provide a base for future\nresearch.\nThis paper brings together a number of indicators that clearly demonstrate where\nSMTEs are in relation to Internet awareness and online learning systems. The paper\nalso provides a set of factors that need to be monitored for the future. This would\nhelp researchers investigating ICT penetration and online learning systems\ndevelopment in SMTEs in Europe and beyond. It will also help government to\nunderstand further the importance of online learning and information technologies\nadoption by SMTEs, so that they can provide further assistance to this sensitive\ngroup.\nThe principal aim of the study was to:\n\u2022 Set up an inter-organisational knowledge and experience network via an\nonline learning system\n\u2022 Extend knowledge and qualification improvement of SMTES\n\u2022 Decrease reservations of SMTEs about ICTs\nData Collection\nThe respective National Hotel Associations such as the British Hospitality Association\n(BHA), Austrian Hotel Association (OHA) and HCIMA, Swiss Hotel Association in\neach country were employed as intermediaries to acquire access to large numbers of\nSMTEs. Developing relationships with industry players, distributors and\nrepresentation companies also ensured that respondents adopted a medium to long\nterm strategy of the Internet. `This study comprised both primary and secondary\nresearch. Secondary research focused on a comprehensive literature review with\ndata sourced from journal publications, books as well as the Internet which proved to\nbe a valuable secondary resource for obtaining statistical data. . This secondary\nresearch identified the knowledge already known on SMTEs and their assimilation of\nInformation and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and eLearning into their\nbusiness practices. Primary research consisted of data collected via qualitative and\nquantitative methods.\nDue to the wide geographic area involved in the study, and the impracticability of\ncarrying out in-depth qualitative interviews a questionnaire was considered to be the\nmost appropriate to reach the required population sample (250) across four\nEuropean countries. After some prior testing with Austrian hoteliers an open and\nclosed structured questionnaire was designed. The quantitative research was\nconducted through self-administered questionnaires distributed to SMTEs via e-mail\nand fax. The survey included hotel SMTEs in Austria, Ireland, Great Britain,\nSwitzerland and Italy. Alternatively, interested hoteliers were able to download the\nquestionnaire from the SMART-UP information web page (http:\/\/www.smartup.info).\nThe quantitative study was employed to assess the management challenges and\nInternet usage amongst SMTEs as well as to gain an insight into SMTE perceptions\non eLearning. The questionnaire also provided a snapshot of how SMTEs perceived\nonline learning. The qualitative data collection involved a telephone survey which\nwas implemented to boost the response rate. A total of 55 questionnaires were\ncompleted which resulted in a response rate of 22% being achieved, therefore\nproviding a valid sample size for the subsequent statistical analysis to be carried out.\nLimitations\nResearch was undertaken to identify small and medium-sized hotel properties in\nAustria, Great Britain, Ireland and Switzerland. Most of the SMTEs targeted were\neither micro (1-5 bedrooms) or medium sized (50+ bedrooms). Following discussion\nwith several hoteliers on the phone, it was realised that some were at a very\nadvanced stage with eCommerce. However, the majority of the very small proprietors\nwere in the denial stage (i.e. they did not want to know about the Internet). A number\nof larger properties were only interested\/were too involved in the operational\nmanagement of their organisation and took a short-term approach. They failed to\nidentify the benefits that can be obtained from eCommerce or\/and training. Many of\nthe hoteliers also reacted badly to the word \u2013 university, and they failed to recognise\nthe benefits that the university could bring in helping them to understand and learn\nabout eCommerce. Limitations also arose from the e-mail survey. It was difficult to\ncontrol the response speed. SMTEs did not respond to the questionnaire as a vast\nmajority indicated that many of the questions were designed for academics with little\nrelevance to small hotels. Therefore a low response rate was achieved via this\nmethod, as there was little opportunity for explanation or interaction.\nAnalysis\/Results\nManagement challenges within SMTEs\nThe respondents were asked to identify what they considered to be their major\nchallenges facing their organisation today. It is clear from the results (70%) that\nHuman Resource Management is the biggest challenge for SMTEs. Other challenges\ninclude sales and marketing, finance and quality management as illustrated in Figure\n1. Due to the characteristics attributed to the hospitality industry (i.e. high staff\nturnover) this is not surprising. No indication was provided that Information\nTechnology was a major management challenge at present. However, results did\nsignify that 20% of SMTEs identified IT issues becoming one of the biggest know-\nhow gaps in the future. This could demonstrate that the remaining percentage are\neither technologically advanced or they were still in the denial stages, and do not\nenvisage that Information technologies are important for future competitiveness. The\nlatter may be more appropriate as previous studies have confirmed that SMTE\nmanagers are reluctant to invest, learn or adopt in ICTs as they do not consider it a\npriority at present.\nFigure 1 Management Challenges within SMTEs\nInternet Usage by SMTEs\nThe survey clearly demonstrated that a high percentage (93%) of the respondents\nuse the Internet, primarily as a mechanism to promote their hotel, i.e. have their own\nwebsite. SMTEs have obviously realised that even with the lack of financial\nresources they can take advantage of the Internet as a direct distribution channel in\nreaching a global market and at a lower cost than distributing through the traditional\ndistribution channels.\nSMTEs do not use the Internet for inter- and intra-organisational purposes. Figure 2\nillustrates that SMTEs use the Internet for other purposes such as sourcing\ninformation, online shopping and banking and industry information. This may be due\nto the lack of knowledge and skill by managers of SMTEs on how to use the Internet\nfor intra- and inter-organisational communication (i.e. Intranet and Extranet).\nStarkov and Price (2002) reported in order to be successful online, it is critical for\nhotels to have online reservations. From the qualitative survey it emerged that very\nfew SMTEs facilitate online reservations. However, the majority of SMTEs surveyed\ndo have booking request forms and use e-mail to communicate and provide\nconfirmation of a reservation back to the customer. The low level of eCommerce\nmay be explained by the fact that the respondents of the survey was predominately\nfocused on SMTEs, who have yet to explore the Internet to its full potential and for\nwhom eCommerce applications still represents a further stage of adaptation .\nFigure 2 Purposes for SMTEs using the Internet\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70\n%of Cases\nQuality Management\nFinance\nSales & Marketing\nHuman Resource Mgt\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n% of Cases\nIndustry Information\nonline Shopping\nOnline Banking\nInformation Source\nPresent the hotel\nAlthough SMTEs usage of the Internet is relatively high for certain purposes, there\nwere also some barriers identified that prevented SMTEs using the Internet to its full\ncapability. These barriers are illustrated in Figure 3. Firstly complexity of trying to\nnavigate through websites was recognised as the main inhibitor; secondly download\ntime was perceived to be too slow; which may be due to inefficient hardware\nsystems; thirdly, the design of websites and finally too little information was available.\nFigure 3 Barriers preventing SMTEs to use the Internet to full capacity\nThe above analysis demonstrates that the vast majority of SMTEs use the Internet as\na digital brochure and promote limited information through their web page.\nInteractivity is primarily through e-mail, and the content is more static than dynamic.\nQualitative research also confirmed that the majority of SMTEs are unable to develop\na comprehensive eMarketing strategy which would have enabled them to promote\ntheir URL, ensure search engine optimisation and drive Customer Relationship\nManagement (CRM) to a wider and more targeted audience. Hence, this is why\nSMTEs still regard their web page as their static digital brochure.\nProfessional Training within SMTEs\nDue to high staff turnover rates, associated with the hospitality industry, it has\nbecome critical for managers of SMTEs to introduce training either on the job and\/or\nvia online to retain and educate staff. A relatively high number (73%) of the\nrespondents specified that it was the managers who attended professional training\nunits regularly. Although this indicates a positive reaction to training, it can also be\nexposed as a negative comment as it could also indicate that little time is then spent\nin-house training, which coincidently has an effect on high staff turnover rates, thus\nsupporting the view of HEFCE (1998), Boisevert (2000) and Buhalis (1999). One\nthird of hoteliers who did not find the time to attend training sessions by professional\nbodies attributed this to various reasons. Training was not considered an investment\nfor most SMTEs who concentrated on their operational management. Therefore, it\ncould be implied here that there is a high demand for online training as it does not\ninvolve travelling away from the business and to the degree that training can be\ndelivered at flexible hours to match the yearly, seasonal and daily seasonality of the\nhotel. Thus, the participation of SMTEs in online training may not only benefit SMTEs\nwidely but it would also be more cost-effective in the long-term.\nThe knowledge of SMTEs in comparison to their larger counterparts, i.e. hotel chains\non IT maybe somewhat premature. However all of the respondents have managed to\ndevelop an online presence in one way or another. The application of technology by\nSMTEs to create an Internet presence was very high (93%) and may be attributed to\nany training sessions that SMTEs managers attended. These professional training\nsessions give the managers the ability to apply the knowledge and skills gained to\ndevelop an Internet presence, regardless of its sophistication levels. Alternatively,\nSMTEs may have outsourced their web development to an ASP provider; webs\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40\n% of Cases\nNot enough info\nComplexity\nDow nload time slow\nDesign of w ebsites\ndesign company; a hotel representation company; or simply have their hotel property\nrepresented on a Destination Management System (DMS).\nOnline Learning Content\nThe content of online learning modules perceived by the majority of respondents to\nbe useful for inclusion in an online learning system was predominately focused on\nICT trends, followed by marketing, strategy, law, quality management and industry\nnews as illustrated in Figure 4. However, none of the respondents indicated that\nlearning about basic technical skills as important enough to be included in an online\nlearning module. Therefore, it can be assumed that Hotel SMTEs may outsource any\ntechnical development or maintenance due to inhibiting factors, such as, lack of in-\nhouse technical skills or financial resources. However, the results also gave the\nindication that hotel SMTEs are becoming more conscious of the importance of ICTs.\nThey are willing to learn how they can utilise ICTs to help them achieve competitive\nadvantage in the digital world.\nFigure 4 Preferred Online Learning Content\nThe survey results also indicated that Internet links, access to download online\nconsultancy reports, periodical newsletters on hotel industry trends; and access to a\nrange of academic resources to support their understanding and enhance their\nlearning are desirable features for the eLearning environment. In addition, advice for\nfurther education and information on workshops and seminars was also considered\nuseful by 16% as demonstrated in Figure 5.\nFigure 5 Additional information sources for online courses\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n%\no\nfC\na\ns\ne\ns\nTr\ne\nn\nds\n(IC\nT)\nM\na\nrk\ne\ntin\ng\nQu\na\nlity\nM\na\nn\na\nge\nm\ne\nn\nt\nIn\ndu\nst\nry\nNe\nw\ns\nSt\nra\nte\ngy\nLa\nw\n16%\n14%\n31%\n25%\n14% Advice on Seminars etc\nInternet Links\nDow nloads - Reports\nNew sletters\nBook\/Journals\nThe advantages and disadvantages perceived by online learning systems\nAs discussed in the literature, online learning has specific advantages to that of\ntraditional learning. Mason (2001) has suggested that \u2018time is the new distance\u2019. This\ncan be applied to SMTEs where lack the time; rather than the long distance; is a key\ninhibiting factor for them to participate in an off-line learning environment.\nApproximately 74% of the respondents perceived time independence as the main\nadvantage of online learning. Thus, enabling SMTEs to study according to their\nseasonability and other operational management commitments they may have. Other\nfactors included quick and easy access to course content and up to date information.\nLow costs were specified as a major advantage by 14% for participating in online\nlearning.\nSMTEs value prompt and informative feedback on their work, as they maintain it has\nan influence on their online learning experience. However, lack of interpersonal\ncontact with other users and lack of communication, support and feedback from\nmodule co-ordinators which lead to low motivational levels was one of the major\ndisadvantages perceived by SMTEs from online learning. It is also interesting to\nnote that a study by Alexander (2001) reported that adequate access to technical\nsupport is essential for learners in achieving successful learning outcomes. The\nsurvey results gave no indication that information on technological skill (i.e. using a\ncomputer) or inadequate technical support was considered a major disadvantage for\nparticipating in online learning activities. Other disadvantages perceived by SMTEs\nwere lack of industry and best practice examples. SMTEs also indicated that online\nlearning often does not give the managers or employees the possibility of achieving a\nrecognised qualification or accreditation. Moreover, if recognition was given it could\nprovide an incentive to employees and may also help to alleviate high staff turnover.\nDiscussion and Implications\nThe main challenge for SMTEs in their current situation was identified as dealing with\nhuman resource management. The adoption and implementation of ICTs is not a\npriority for many SMTEs at present. Due to the characteristics associated with\nSMTEs and their slow adoption of ICTs this is not surprising. Another major downfall\nof SMTEs as identified by Connolly et al (1998) is that SMTEs understandably do not\nwant to wait long-term to see their return on investment on ICTs but want to see the\nbenefits immediately.\nIt is evident from the survey however; many SMTEs may be more willing to engage in\nthe use of the Internet and online learning if they can overcome the barriers that are\npreventing them from moving forward in this digital economy. These have been\nidentified as lack of financial resources and the time and unwillingness to invest in\ntraining. SMTEs have yet to realise that by incorporating training it gives them the\nability to solve some of their human resource issues, such as high staff turnover,\nwhich is so commonplace in the hospitality industry. It is critical for SMTEs to invest\nin new skills through online learning. This also gives SMTEs the opportunity to exploit\nthe new technologies available and avoid the loss of potential competitive advantage.\nIt is important for SMTEs to realise that by learning online they will not only increase\ntheir knowledge but their core competencies. This can help SMTEs to overcome their\nmanagement challenges and issues. It was therefore proposed that the online\nlearning modules for the eLearning Platform incorporated the following topics: human\nresource management, eCommerce, quality management, capacity management\nand product development. The modules were designed by Universities of the 4\nparticipating countries: Austria, Great Britain, Ireland and Switzerland. As part of the\nproject, an eLearning platform (SITOS) is currently being implemented into 4\nEuropean countries to attract SMTEs into an eLearning environment, which should\nfacilitate their transition towards the digital world. The aim is to raise awareness on\nthe importance of the above modules and how they can play a fundamental role in\nimproving the day-to-day operation of SMTEs in the long-term. It was also decided\nto provide benchmarking models and best practice methods to enable SMTEs to\nderive problem solutions and to provide a better understanding of what they need to\nachieve to improve their competitive advantage.\nAnother important priority of eLearning is to assess the future quality of eLearning\nneeds. The provision of consistent and accurate content at the right time can support\neffective training and help managers and employees of SMTEs to acquire the\nappropriate knowledge and skills. They can then apply this knowledge to improve\nindividual and organisational performance and which according to Hinkin & Tracey\n(2000) may be linked to a reduction in high employee turnover too.\nThe SMART-UP project has aimed to provide this by employing intelligent agents\nwhich can be used by SMTEs for training purposes along with the online learning\nmodules. Information is retrieved from various sources such as online journals, online\nnews portals etc. These links can be incorporated in the eLearning platform in\naccordance to SMTE specifications. It also aims to dynamically increase the network\nof know-how sources (i.e. universities, hotel associations) due to inter-agent\ncommunication using this intelligent systems platform. Figure 6 illustrates how the\nproposed SMART-UP online learning system will operate using the intelligent agents,\nknow-how sources, national hotel associations and the universities for the provision\nof recent, accurate, static and dynamic information.\nFigure 6 Design of the SMART- UP online learning system\n- Intelligent Agents\n- Expert Discussions\n- Mailing-Service\nRecent information:\n- Learning Modules\n- Benchmarking Cases\nStatic Information:\n- Exams\/Performance\nMeasurement\n- Certification\nTest Section\nUsers\nSMTEs\nIntermediaries\nNational Hotel\nAssociations\nUniversity Experts\nIntermediaries\nNational Hotel\nAssociations\nNon-achievement of a qualification or accreditation was a major disadvantage\nperceived by SMTEs from online learning. However, due to the traditional approach\nto accreditation for completion of classes and programs this is not considered a\nviable standard of measurement in an eLearning environment. This may be due to\nthe fact that the online learning is self-directed and content can come from a wide\nvariety of sources. The eLearning modules need to be assessed in appropriate ways\nand the assessment needs to reflect the learning objectives of the module. Although\nthe SMART-UP model incorporates a test section it does not provide an official\nqualification recognised by the hotel industry. Therefore an approach could be taken\nby the government, professional bodies, universities and the private sector to grant\nofficial recognition and reward for eLearning based programs. This may then enable\nemployees in SMTEs to gradually develop their learning portfolio to achieve\nUniversity degrees or professional qualifications and may provide more of an\nincentive for SMTEs to participate in online learning programs.\nRecommendations\nIt is important to create conditions that are in favour of eLearning and to eliminate\nbarriers that prevent people from participating in an eLearning environment.\nEnabling employees to participate in eLearning at work rather than outside working\nhours is important as well as ensuring that the course content is applicable and\nspecific to the learning requirements of SMTEs. Otherwise this can be a less\nsatisfying eLearning experience and discourage employees from engaging in it. The\nprovision of incentives and funding by government to SMTEs that invest in\ndeveloping eLearning within their organisations may help to promote broader access\nto eLearning.\nWith eLearning still an emerging field the government, universities and the private\nsector should invest in research and development aimed at furthering the\nunderstanding of best practices in online learning along with its delivery and service.\nHaving identified the social and cultural issues related to SMTEs, an investigation\ninto the ways in which technology can be introduced to SMTEs is critical so that the\nvalue of eLearning can be enhanced in this technology-enabled environment.\neLearning is also only possible when the appropriate infrastructure and technology is\nin place. This infrastructure may include high-speed telecommunications, i.e.\nbroadband Internet services and connectivity and the high quality software which is\nrequired for effective eLearning. However many SMTEs may not have the\ntechnology, the high-speed access and the skills required to make the most of\neLearning. Therefore government, universities, associations and private sector must\naddress this issue to ensure that continued work and investment is carried out to\nenable SMTEs to have this access.\nConclusion\nAs Braun (2002) indicated, SMTEs suffer from a lack of a strategic sense of how to\nmove forward in the eMarketplace. SMTEs use the Internet mainly to promote their\nproperty through a website. They have yet to incorporate an eBusiness strategy into\ntheir business, use web-enabled technologies to assist them in their internal and\nexternal business processes. Therefore, the challenge for SMTEs is to realise the full\npotential of eLearning as a driver to increasing productivity, performance and profit,\nby making it an integral part of their strategy and operations. The ability of SMTEs to\nembrace eLearning can become crucial determinants of success and improve the\ncompetitiveness of SMTEs and point the way to an era of unprecedented growth and\nopportunity in the digital economy.\nReferences\nAlexander, S., 2001, E-learning developments and experiences, Education and\nTraining, Vol. 43, No 4\/5, pp.240-248\nAnckar, B., and Walden, P., 2001, Introducing Web Technology in a small peripheral\nhospitality organisation, International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality\nManagement, Vol.13 (5), pp.241-250\nBecker, G.
