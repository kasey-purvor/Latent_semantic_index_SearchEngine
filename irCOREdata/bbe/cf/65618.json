From east to west, the Faroes\u2013Iceland\u2013\nGreenland \u2018transect\u2019 spans environments that are of an\nincreasingly Arctic character, as they become colder and\nmore continental in character as both themarine and atmo-\nspheric polar fronts are crossed (Fig. 1). Within this broad\nclimatic range, there is a wealth of other variants imposed\nby biogeography, volcanism, and topography. As a result,\nin the process of expansion westwards, groups of Scand-\ninavian settlers faced a variety of challenges with dif-\nfering resources, constraints, and opportunities, and pro-\nduced contrasting environmental impacts that have signi-\nficant implications for the history of human settlement.\nAfter the successful colonisation of the Faroes and\nIceland, expansion to Greenland at the end of the tenth\ncentury brought Norse settlers closer to the limits of\n22 DUGMORE AND OTHERS\nFig. 1. The North Atlantic region showing the areas of Norse settlement and the major features of oceanic\ncirculation that typify the environmental gradients across the region. The Norse settled limited areas of\nsouthern Greenland and all of Iceland save the interior highlands and glaciated areas (glaciers shown in\nFig. 3). Virtually all the landscapes of the Faroes were utilised by the Norse, but actual settlement sites were\nnear the coast.\ntheir European-style agricultural systems. It was along\nthis Arctic frontier that contact was made with other\npeoples, first with the Dorset palaeo-eskimo (Sutherland\n2000) and later (probably after AD 1100) with the Thule\nculture, ancestors of the modern Inuit (McGhee 2000;\nPark 2000). Around AD 1000, the tide of European\nexpansion was finally broken against the shores of\nNewfoundland. L\u2019Anse aux Meadows on the northwest\npeninsula was probably only occupied for a few seasons\nat most (McGovern 1981; Wallace 2000; Davis and others\n1988). Greenland saw a longer European settlement that\nlasted for at least 400 years, before climate change,\nperhaps coupledwith cultural intransigence, forced retreat\n(Arneborg 1991; McGovern 1994; Barlow and others\n1998).\nThis paper considers current knowledge of North\nAtlantic island environments before landna\u00b4m and dur-\ning initial settlement, in order to assess environmental\nimpacts. This assessment highlights key environmental\ncontrasts across the Atlantic, the significant variation\nin current knowledge, and the potential for developing\nfurther understanding.\nChronology\nOne of the key challenges for palaeoenvironmental\nreconstruction and the assessment of human impacts is\nintegrating the various lines of evidence into a coherent\nchronological whole (Meese and others 1994; Edwards\nand others, in press). The two key environmental dating\ntechniques employed in the North Atlantic region are\nradiocarbon dating and tephrochronology.\nDespite its vital role, radiocarbon dating has a number\nofweaknesses, both inherentwithin the technique and also\nspecific to the region. A number of these problems have\nlong been acknowledged (Olsson 1982, 1986), causing\ndetailed debate and controversy, for example over the\ndating of landna\u00b4m in Iceland (Vilhja\u00b4lmsson 1990, 1991;\nHermanns-Au\u00f0ardo\u00b4ttir 1991; Olsson 1992; Theodo\u00b4rsson\n1998) and the Faroes (Jo\u00b4hansen 1985; Debes 1993; Arge\n1991, 1993; Hannon and Bradshaw 2000) (Fig. 2). The\ninherent problems include the precision and resolution\nof the technique, especially when considering detailed\npalaeoenvironmental trajectories at the time of landna\u00b4m\n(Dugmore and others 2000). Perhaps of most relevance\nto radiocarbon dating landna\u00b4m in the North Atlantic is\nthe presence of a small but significant plateau within\nthe calibration curve in the latter centuries of the first\nmillennium cal AD. Thismeans that landna\u00b4m radiocarbon\ndates within this plateau can only produce a broad chrono-\nlogical resolution. A further plateau exists within the fifth\nand sixth centuries cal AD, which will impact on dating\nresolution when establishing environmental trajectories\nprior to landna\u00b4m (Dugmore and others 2000). In addition,\nprior to the widespread availability of single entity AMS\nradiocarbon dating in the mid-1990s, the analysis of bulk\nsamples potentially led to the incorporating of carbon\nfrom a variety of entities (Ashmore 1999). The use of\nAMS radiocarbon dating of small samples has, however,\nintroduced new methodological and technical challenges\nthat are only now beginning to be tackled (Wohlfarth and\nothers 1998; Nilsson and others 2001).\nDespite this, dating single entities produces more pre-\ncise data than bulk dates on aggregate samples composed\nTHE NORSE LANDN \u00b4AM ON THE NORTH ATLANTIC ISLANDS 23\nFig. 2. Radiocarbon dates from a peat record spanning the period of Norse settlement and initial environmental\nimpacts at Hov, Faroe Islands (Jo\u00b4hansen 1982, 1985). In addition, key tephra isochrons from across the North\nAtlantic are shown to illustrate the complementary nature of the two dating techniques. The age of the SILK-YN\ntephra is derived from radiocarbon dating, the landna\u00b4m tephra from correlations to the Greenland ice cores,\nand H1104, H1300, and H1510 are dated from historical records (Tho\u00b4rarinsson 1967). The laboratory codes\ndenote the uncalibrated dates published by Jo\u00b4hansen (1982). The calibrated date range of the radiocarbon\ndates at two standard deviations using OxCal v. 3.5 (Bronk-Ramsey 2000) is shown by the thick black lines.\nThese data highlight key contrasts in resolution between radiocarbon dating and tephrochronology.\nof a range of materials of slightly (or significantly)\ndifferent ages. However, well-preserved single entities\n(such as plant macrofossils within a well-humified peat)\nmay be discovered and not be of the same age as the\nsurrounding material making up those strata. For this\nreason, a radiocarbon date on a discrete fraction (such as\nhumic acid)maygivemore accurate ages for the formation\nof the actual matrix of a particular sediment than AMS\ndates on single entities within those strata.\nTephrochronology is the dating technique based on\nthe identification and correlation of layers of volcanic\nash (pyroclastic ejecta, most typically) that form time-\nparallelmarker horizons (isochrons) (Tho\u00b4rarinsson 1944).\nAn individual tephra layer can be used to define a\nprecise spatial reconstruction of an environment at what\nis effectively a moment in time. Integration with other\ndating evidence (for example, historical records, data\nfrom ice cores, or radiocarbon dating) can enable this\nmoment to be fixed to a specific date or age range (Fig. 2).\nMultiple tephra layers can be used to mark the passage\nof time, and the occurrence of tephra in a context that\nis of a different age (as may happen if the tephra is\nredeposited) can help to identify pathways followed by\nsediments through the environment (Dugmore and others\n2000). Inter-site correlation of tephra isochrons provides\na powerful framework for the high-resolution and large-\nscale analysis of the spatial and chronological dimensions\nof environmental change and human impact (Dugmore\nand others 2000). A very detailed tephrochronology has\nbeen established for Iceland (summarised by Hafli\u00f0ason\nand others 2000) that contains almost 30 isochrons from\nAD 400 to 1510. For periods when appropriate historical\nrecords exist, these can be used to attach precise dates to\ntephra layers, data that are sometimes precise to within\nhours (for example, Tho\u00b4rarinsson 1967, 1975). Some of\nthese isochrons have been identified across large areas\nof the North Atlantic, including the GISP2 and GRIP\nice cores (Zielinski and others 1995; Gro\u00a8nvold and others\n1995),marine cores (Eir\u0131\u00b4ksson and others 2000), the Faroe\nIslands (Dugmore and Newton 1998), the British Isles\n(Dugmore and others 1995; Hall and Pilcher 2002) and\neven parts of northern Germany (van den Bogaard and\nSchmincke 2002). A set of isochrons occurs in the ninth\nand tenth centuries AD. Crucially these tephra include\nthe \u2018Landna\u00b4m tephra\u2019 that covers much of Iceland, and\nhas been identified in the Greenland ice and dated to AD\n24 DUGMORE AND OTHERS\n871\u00b1 2 (Gro\u00a8nvold and others 1995), and at a number\nof sites in the Faroes (Wasterga\u02dard and others 2001).\nOriginally identified by Tho\u00b4rarinsson (1944) as layer\nVIIa and VIIb, this tephra is found in the turves used\nto construct early settlements on Iceland and underlies\nmajor vegetation changes caused by people (Einarsson\n1961;Hallsdo\u00b4ttir 1987). This tephrawas produced by sim-\nultaneous activity in both the Vei\u00f0ivo\u00a8tn and Torfajo\u00a8kull\nvolcanic systems (Larsen 1984). Gro\u00a8nvald and others\u2019\n(1995) dating of this tephra to AD 871\u00b1 2 resolved a\nnumber of debates about the timing of colonisation that\ncould not be tackled with radiocarbon. It is consistent\nwith a Norse settlement after AD 870, as recorded in\n\u00b4Islendingabo\u00b4k (Book of Icelanders).\nThis tephra distribution allows the environmental\nimpact of landna\u00b4m to be assessed against a very accurate\nchronological marker on a semi-hemispheric scale. With\nmultiple isochrons covering the initial centuries of the\nlandna\u00b4m, especially in Iceland, this provides an excellent\ncorrelative tool for assessing local and regional landscape\nand geomorphic change. As with any dating technique,\nhowever, there are a number of limitations. The most\nimportant of these limitations is that the isochrons\nare limited to the areas covered by identifiable fallout\nand a depositional record (Dugmore and others 1995);\nin addition there is the potential for redeposition and\nwinnowing of tephra in dynamic environments (Bierle and\nBond 2002). Also, some indistinguishable geochemical\nsignatures from different eruptions exist (Larsen and\nothers 1999, 2001) and eruptions of prehistoric tephra\ncan only be dated by radiocarbon techniques and so their\nnumerical dating resolution and precision is dependent\non what can be achieved through radiocarbon dating\n(compare SILK-YN tephra in Dugmore and others 2000).\nHowever, problems of equifinality can be tackled by\nconsidering the totality of information available (Westgate\nand Gorton 1981), and where radiocarbon dating is the\nonly way to produce numerical dates, then at least the\noptimum location for the dating can be chosen fromwithin\nthe area covered by fallout, and this may be very extensive\n(Dugmore and others 1995).\nIn addition to providing chronological controls to date\nenvironmental change, tephra may also act as agents\nof environmental change. There has been much debate\nabout putative environmental and cultural changes caused\nby volcanic impact on climate (for example, Buckland\nand others 1997), but in Iceland there are unambiguous\neffects caused by tephra directly (such as tephra fallout\nfrom \u00a8Oraefajo\u00a8kull 1362 and Askja\u00b4 1875 directly onto\nsettlements) and indirect effects, such as large-scale\nanimal mortality and related famine caused by fluorosis\nfollowing the eruptions of Katla 1755 and Laki 1783.\nIn these cases, tephra may provide abrupt environmental\n\u2018shocks\u2019 that can be used to assess sensitivity and\nrobustness within environmental and cultural systems.\nOverall, tephrochronology provides a critical extra\ndimension to palaeoenvironmental studies in the North\nAtlantic region, and this, combinedwith the area\u2019s cultural\nhistory and island geography, gives it great potential\nfor the studies of human\u2013environment interactions and\nhuman impact.\nThe origins of the pre-landna\u00b4m biota\nThe limited diversity of North Atlantic pre-landna\u00b4m\nisland biota, a reflection of the modes of origin, has major\nimplications for the interpretation of evidence for en-\nvironmental change both before and after the arrival of\npeople. The relatively limited flora means that vegeta-\ntional changes are less complex than in more temperate\nmainland regions with higher diversity. For example, in\nIceland, there was typically birch (Betula sp.) and willow\n(Salix sp.) woodland\/scrub or no woodland. Similarly,\nmany heaths were dominated by a handful of species\nwith quite similar climatic tolerances. In general the\ninvertebrate faunaswere also limited in diversity, deficient\nin host-specific species, and dominated by generalists.\nThis is particularly true of the beetle and fly faunas, where\npre-landna\u00b4m changes probably reflected local edaphic\nevents rather than climate change. Before the arrival of\npeople there were no land mammals in the Faroes and\nlikewise for Iceland, save for the Arctic fox (Alopex\nlagopus L.) and the polar bear (Ursus maritimus L.)\nthat reached the island by crossing winter sea ice in\nthe Denmark Strait. In contrast Greenland had, and has,\nindigenous populations of grazing mammals, for example\ncaribou (Rangifer tarandus L.) and musk oxen (Ovibus\nmoschatus Erchl.), as well as the marine mammals\ncommon to the shores of the other Atlantic islands.\nThe essentially European nature of the terrestrial and\nfresh-water aquatic flora and fauna of the Atlantic islands\nhas been discussed for more than a century (Buckland\n1988). Ostenfeld (1926) examined the Greenlandic flora,\nsuggesting thatmanyEuropean taxawere anthropochores,\nand Iversen (1934) was early in the application of pollen\nanalysis to this biogeographical problem. The origins\nof the insect fauna of Iceland, and by implication of\nthe Faroes and Greenland, formed the core of Carl\nLindroth\u2019s (1931) doctoral thesis. Yet despite his own\nearly involvement in the study of fossil insects (compare\nLindroth 1948), identifications of Quaternary insects from\nboth the Faroes (Jessen and Rasmussen 1922) and Iceland\n(Thorkelsson 1935), and his own frequent return to the\nproblems of the biota (for example, Lindroth 1960;\nLindroth and others 1988), he never effectively utilised\nthe fossil record to test his arguments for survival in situ,\nalthough he was aware that the virtual absence of\nendemics from the islandsmilitated against his hypothesis\nof long-term survival in refugia. The nature of the baseline\npre-landna\u00b4m beetle faunas supports a model of virtual\nannihilation of pre-glacial biota and late-glacial or Early\nHolocene immigration (Buckland and Dugmore 1991;\nBuckland and others 1998a). Although the study of late-\nglacial plantmacrofossils fromTorfadalsvatn on the Skagi\npeninsula in the north of Iceland has recently been used to\nresurrect the refugia hypothesis (Rundgren and Ingo\u00b4lfsson\nTHE NORSE LANDN \u00b4AM ON THE NORTH ATLANTIC ISLANDS 25\n1999), it seems probable that the pre-landna\u00b4m biota\narrived largely by ice-rafting fromEurope during the rapid\nwarming that characterised the end of the last glaciation.\nSome elements may well have arrived either earlier or\nlater than the main immigration event, as part of the\naerial plankton, and occasional plant propagules could\nhave survived for years in the Arctic pack in the cracks\nof driftwood (Johansen and Hytteborn 2001). However,\nthe bulk of the fauna and flora, including relatively\nheavy flightless ground beetles and weevils, was probably\ndispersed to the islands during the breakup of the main\nnorth European ice sheet approximately 11,600 years\nago. Although this does not preclude an earlier dispersal\nevent after the glacial maximum, the boreo-temperate\nnature of the beetle fauna and the virtual absence of true\nArctic elements suggest that many species could not have\nsurvived through the Younger Dryas cold stage.\nThe development of the pre-landna\u00b4m biota is a key\nstep in determining the potential impacts of landna\u00b4m\nitself. The composition of the biota presented a range\nof constraints and opportunities for the early settlers that\nwere different to similar climatic zones of the continental\nmainland, Britain, or Ireland. In addition, it created the\npotential for \u2018false analogy.\u2019 Early settlers found areas\nthat appeared familiar and comparable to parts of their\nhomelands, but despite some clear visual similarities (in\nthe appearance of heathland or grassland, for example),\nthese new lands of the Atlantic islands were fundament-\nally different. Profound contrasts in biomass productivity\nand its seasonal distribution, ecological resilience, and\nsensitivity to erosion could all have presented early settlers\nwith unexpected challenges and potentially catastrophic\nchanges.\nLandna\u00b4m\nAccording to Dicuil\u2019s De mensura orbis terrae, written\nin approximately AD 825 at the court of Charlemagne\u2019s\nsuccessors (Tierney 1967), Christian Gaels, monks, or\nhermits had settled on islands the description of which\npoints to the Faroes, bringing with them at least sheep.\nJo\u00b4hansen\u2019s investigations at archaeological and field sites\nin the Faroes (Jo\u00b4hansen 1985) led him to suggest that there\nwere two settlement periods, the first, pre-Viking, between\nAD 600 and 700, and the second, Viking landna\u00b4m,\nbetween 850 and 900. However, Buckland and others\n(1998b) challenged the validity of Jo\u00b4hansen\u2019s dating at the\nkey site of Lambi on Mykines, while Arge (1991) pointed\nout that Jo\u00b4hansen\u2019s claim for an early settlement could not\nbe supported by archaeological evidence, as there were\nvery few artefacts dating from the first millennium. Sub-\nsequent excavations at Toftanes (Hansen 1989, 1991) have\nconfirmed the presence of the later, Viking settlement,\nbut currently there is still no definitive archaeological\nevidence for an earlier, pre-Viking settlement. Further\npollen and macrofossil work at Tj\u00f8rnuv\u0131\u00b4k, Ei\u00f0i and\nKorkadalur (Hannon and Bradshaw 2000; Hannon and\nothers 1998, 2001), including new AMS dates, has\nbeen used to support Jo\u00b4hansen\u2019s hypothesis that the first\nsettlement occurred closer to 600 than 800. Unfortunately,\nthe variability in the AMS dates and the presence of\na radiocarbon plateau make it impossible to use this\nmethod alone to pin down accurately the date of the\nfirst palaeoenvironmental hints of settlement where these\ndates lie between AD 500 and 700 (Fig. 2). The in situ\npresence of the \u2018Landna\u00b4m tephra\u2019 of AD 871\u00b1 2 could\nhelp to resolve this issue definitively (compare Hannon\nand others 2001).\nA number of written sources of varying reliability are\navailable for the earliest settlement in Iceland. The sug-\ngestion that Irish monks occupied the country before the\nNorse settlers arrived is supported byDicuil\u2019sDe mensura\norbis terrae, but this has not been supported by pa-\nlaeoenvironmental or archaeological data (for example,\nBuckland and others 1995b; Sveinbjarnardo\u00b4ttir 2002).\nThe main and most comprehensive historical sources\nfor the settlement of Iceland are \u00b4Islendingabo\u00b4k (Book\nof Icelanders), written in the early twelfth century, and\nLandna\u00b4mabo\u00b4k (Book of Settlement), also thought to have\nbeen originally written in the twelfth century, but only\npreserved in the form of later versions. Neither source is\ncontemporary with the events they describe.\nThe early historical sources may be principally con-\ncernedwith establishing the prior claims of the church and\nleading families to the land (Benediktsson 1974; Rafnsson\n1974, 1976; Gr\u0131\u00b4msdo\u00b4ttir 1996).Whilst the literary sources\nmay reflect foundation myths rather than fact (Einarsson\n1995), archaeology, palynology, and tephrochronology\nindicate that the dates are approximately correct (compare\nTho\u00b4rarinsson 1944;Gro\u00a8nvold and others 1995;Hallsdo\u00b4ttir\n1987), although there have been arguments for signific-\nantly earlier dates (compare Hermanns-Au\u00f0ardo\u00b4ttir 1989,\nbut see Sveinbjarnardo\u00b4ttir 1990; Vilhja\u00b4lmsson 1990; and\nHermanns-Au\u00f0ardo\u00b4ttir 1991). It seems that the land was\nsoon fully settled. Estimates for the initial size of the\npopulation at the end of the settlement period range\nfrom 40,000 to 100,000, depending on how the available\nsources are interpreted (Karlson 2000). Estimates of\npasture productivity and stocking levels around the time\nof settlement have produced suggestions of between\n70,000 and 80,000 as possible population levels at that\ntime (Fri\u00f0riksson 1972). A number of Viking-period\nsites have been excavated in Iceland, key examples\nbeing Herjo\u00b4lfsdalur in the Vestmanmaeyjar off the south\ncoast (Hermanns-Au\u00f0ardo\u00b4ttir 1989), Papey off the east\ncoast (Eldja\u00b4rn 1989), Granasta\u00f0ir (Einarsson 1995) and\nHofsta\u00f0ir (Fri\u00f0riksson andVe\u00b4steinsson 1997) in the north,\nReykjav\u0131\u00b4k (Nordahl 1988; Roberts 2002) and Greluto\u00b4ttir\n( \u00b4Olafsson 1980) in the west, and Hv\u0131\u00b4ta\u00b4rholt (Magnu\u00b4sson\n1972) in the south.\nFor the Norse settlement of Greenland there are a\nnumber of relevant historical documents, but these vary\ngreatly in their utility. The Gr\u0153nlendinga saga (Green-\nlander\u2019s saga) describes Erik the Red\u2019s journey to and\nsettlement of Greenland, but it is from the early thirteenth\ncentury and is based on oral accounts. The same applies to\nEir\u0131\u00b4ks saga rau\u00f0a (Erik the Red\u2019s saga), alsowritten in the\n26 DUGMORE AND OTHERS\nearly thirteenth century. The two sagas seem to be written\nindependently of each other, but based on the same oral\naccounts (Halldo\u00b4rsson 1978). They disagree on certain\ndetails and cannot be taken as historical fact, but some of\nthe accounts have been supported by recent archaeological\nstudies, such as those at L\u2019Anse aux Meadows (Wallace\n2000).\nAttempts have been made to estimate the Norse\npopulation of Greenland, basing it on number and size\nof farms correlated with a population size. Such estimates\nhave ranged from 3000 to 6000 (Lynnerup 1998). The\nlast record from the more southerly Eastern Settlement,\nin 1407, describes two activities, a marriage and a witch-\nburning; thereafter all is speculation (compare Seaver\n1996).\nLandscapes at landna\u00b4m\nWhat the first settlers saw as they skirted the coasts of the\nvarious islands is difficult to envisage. No such pristine,\ncool-temperate island habitats survived into the age of\nscientific investigation, and the surviving sources are all\nwritten long after the event, often with rather different\nmotives.\nThere is debate over the extent of woodland in the\nFaroes during the Holocene. At present there are no trees\noutside of plantations, and shrub cover is restricted to\njuniper (Juniperus sp.), willow (Salix sp.), and dwarf\nshrubs such as Ling heather (Calluna vulgaris (L.) Hull)\nand crowberry (Empetrum sp.). Jo\u00b4hansen (for example,\n1985) detected considerable quantities of temperate tree\npollen in peat and lake-sediment sequences, but dismissed\nthis as representing long-distance transport, the effect of\nwhich is amplified in environments such as the Faroes,\nwhere pollen productivity is low (Fig. 3A). However,\nHannon andBradshaw (2000) challenged this assumption,\nciting the discovery (Malmros 1990) of a thick layer\nof Downy birch, dated to between 2460 BC and AD\n770, beneath a Viking site at Argisbrekka, Eysturoy\n(Mahler 1993). Less dramatic macrofossil evidence of\nDowny birch and dwarf birch (Betula nana L.) is also\nknown from Streymoy and Eysturoy (Hannon and others\n2001). Hannon and Bradshaw\u2019s own study showed a\ndecline in the pollen of juniper, birch, and willow at\nthe time of the settlement. This range of evidence\nimplies that Jo\u00b4hansen\u2019s assumption that the Faroes were\nunwooded needs some reconsideration. It now seems\ncertain that at least limited pockets of Downy birch\noccurred on the islands in sheltered locations, and that\nshrub cover was thicker before the settlers arrived than it is\ntoday.\nThe lowlands of Iceland, and regions up to 400 m asl,\ncan be, and have been, classified as part of the sub-Alpine\nbirch-forest belt of Fennoscandia, where birch woodland\n(Betula pubescens and Betula pubescens ssp turtuosa)\nwithwillow and juniper, is the potential climax vegetation;\nin addition the interior highlands generally above 400 m\nFig. 3. Pollen sites in different locations in the North\nAtlantic region. 3A (top): the Faroes, based on Jo\u00b4hansen\n(1971, 1979, 1982, 1985, 1989), Edwards and Craigie\n(1998), Hannon and Bradshaw (2000), and Hannon and\nothers (2001, 2002). 3B (middle): Iceland, based mainly on\nCaseldine (2001), Hallsdo\u00b4ttir (1987, 1995), and Buckland\nand others (1995a). 3C (bottom): Greenland, basedmainly\non Fredskild (1973, 1978, 1983, 1985), Kelly and Funder\n(1974), Bick (1978), Bo\u00a8cher and Fredskild (1993), Eisner\nand others (1995), and Wagner and others (2000).\nasl have been described as belonging to the Arctic zone\n(Sjo\u00a8rs 1963) (Fig. 3B). Although this classification is\nTHE NORSE LANDN \u00b4AM ON THE NORTH ATLANTIC ISLANDS 27\nrelevant for pre-landna\u00b4m landscapes, today, after the\nenvironmental impact of the Norse settlement, these\nconcepts are not regarded as useful by many authors\n(Hallsdo\u00b4ttir 1987; \u00b4Olafsdo\u00b4ttir 2001). Today the extent\nof birch forest is very limited \u2014 around 1100 km2, or\nless than 1% of Iceland\u2019s 103,000 km2 area ( \u00b4Olafsdo\u00b4ttir\n2001).\nBoth the Faroes and Iceland lacked indigenous mam-\nmalian grazers and the pre-landna\u00b4m invertebrate faunas\nare deficient in litter-processing species. Whilst the wet\nclimate leads to extensive peat accumulation, the result\nover several thousand years would be the accumulation\nof a deep litter layer in areas beyond the peatlands,\nand woody material significantly older than the time of\nsettlement would inevitably have been available when\npeople first arrived.\nGreenlandhadherdsof caribou (Rangifer tarandusL.),\nand these may have helped to maintain relatively perman-\nent areas of open grassland, in part perhaps perpetuating\nsites once occupied as perennial hunting stations by\nSarqaq eskimoes (compare Buckland and Edwards 1984).\nThe former presence of what Icelandic sources call\nSkr\u0153ling is noted in Islendingabo\u00b4k, in perhaps the first\npiece of archaeological deduction in the North Atlantic\nisland record:\n\u00deeir fundu \u00fear manna vistir, b\u00e6\u00f0i austur og vestur\na\u00b4 landi, og keiplabrot og steinsm\u0131\u00b4\u00f0i \u00fea\u00f0 er af \u00fev\u0131\u00b4\nma\u00b4 skilja, a\u00f0 \u00fear haf\u00f0i \u00feesskonar \u00fejo\u00b4\u00f0 fari\u00f0, er Vin-\nland hefir byggt og Gr\u0153nlendingar kalla Skr\u00e6linga\u2019\n(Halldo\u00b4rsson 1978: 74). (\u2018There they found human\nhabitation sites, both in the east and west of the\ncountry, and fragments of boats made of hide and\nstone implements. From that can be inferred that the\nkind of people who were there were those who settled\nV\u0131\u00b4nland and the Greenlanders call skr\u00e6lingar.\u2019)\nThe first Norse settlers may have been initially\nattracted to these grassy places. Certainly this would\nexplain the occurrence of occasional Sarqaq pieces on\nNorse sites (McGovern and others 1996). The nature and\ndegree of Norse contact with the Dorset successors of\nthe Sarqaq remains unclear, but it is probable that the\nDorset had abandoned southwest Greenland before the\nNorse landna\u00b4m. Much of the remaining area suitable for\npotential settlement in southwest Greenland, however,\nmust have consisted of dense birch and willow, and in\nthe Western Settlement of alder scrub, only penetrable\nalong rare caribou trails, much like the areas outside the\nsheep rangelands at the present day (Fig. 3C). Bo\u00a8cher and\nothers (1968) defined three major vegetational belts: (a) \u2018a\nsubarctic belt in the inland parts of the warmest valleys in\nS. and S.W. Greenland, where the summer temperature\nis high enough to support low woodland\u2019; (b) \u2018a low\narctic belt, extending northwards to c. lat. 72\u25e6N\u2019 (willow\nscrub); and (c) \u2018a high arctic belt including northernmost\nGreenland and cold, outer coastal areas southwards to\nc. lat. 60\u25e6N\u2019 (Cassiope heaths and tundra). Only a handful\nof species can be found in all three belts. Successful,\nregular ripening of cereals is impossible.\nZooarchaeological evidence for the landna\u00b4m\neconomies: the basis of human\nenvironmental impact\nZooarchaeological evidence for both the mix of European\ndomestic animals imported to the North Atlantic islands\nand for the settlers\u2019 use of wild mammals, birds, and\nfish has grown steadily during the past two decades\n(McGovern and others 2001; Enghoff 2003). While the\nFaroes thus far lack published archaeofauna (animal bone\ncollections) from the settlement period, there are now\nseveral settlement-age archaeofauna of quantifiable size\nand broadly comparable excavationmethods from Iceland\nand Greenland. While more large collections from well-\ndated contexts are urgently needed in all three island\ngroups (particularly from the Faroes), it is possible to\nmake some general comments about the patterns of early\nScandinavian economy in Iceland and Greenland based\non the zooarchaeological record of landna\u00b4m as it now\nexists. This gives a key insight into mechanisms of human\nimpacts on the environment.\nFigure 4 presents an overview of the major domestic\nmammals from these collections dating to the settlement\nperiod (ninth through eleventh centuries in Iceland,\neleventh through twelfth centuries in Greenland) and\nincludes for reference an archaeofauna from a high status\nfarm in southern Norway at Aaker (Perdikaris 1990). In\nthe archaeofauna from Aaker in Norway, cattle (Bos sp.)\nbones predominate, followed by pig (Sus sp.) bones and\nby caprines, both sheep (Ovis sp.) and goat (Capra sp.)\ntogether. This pattern probably represented an \u2018ideal farm\u2019\nin the minds of would-be chieftains of the landna\u00b4m era\nin Iceland. The archaeofauna from Tjarnargata 4 under\ncentral Reykjav\u0131\u00b4k, with its large number of cattle and\npig bones, illustrates how closely this ideal was followed\nin the richer districts of the south. The archaeofauna\nfrom the settlement period long hall at A\u00f0alstr\u00e6\u00f0i,\nrecently excavated close to Tjarnargata 4, is too small\nand too heavily skewed by post-depositional attrition to\nbe fully quantifiable, but it does contain pig remains as\nwell as cattle and caprine bones and teeth (Tinsley and\nMcGovern 2002). The other early archaeofauna from the\nVestmanmaeyjar off the south coast (Herjolfsdalur) and\nfrom the Kraka\u00b4 river drainage south of Myvatn in the\nnorth (Sveigakot, SVK) appear somewhat less successful\nin mirroring the patterns of ancestral southern Norway,\nbut the high percentage of cattle and the substantial\npresence of pig bone is notable. In contexts from northern\nIceland dated by radiocarbon and tephra to the tenth\ncentury, archaeofauna present a varied pattern but all\nare comparatively high in cattle (Selhagi, SLH), or pig\n(Hr\u0131\u00b4sheimar, HRH), or both (Granasta\u00f0ir, GST). In these\nearly northern sites, the \u2018caprine\u2019 category is in fact made\nup of both sheep and substantial numbers of goats judging\nby the elements that can be speciated. As the Icelandic\nlandna\u00b4m period closed in the mid-tenth century, many\nfarms of different size were apparently still struggling\nwith varied success to maintain the farming patterns of\nthe ancestral homelands\u2019 economy against a background\n28 DUGMORE AND OTHERS\nFig. 4. Data derived from the zooarchaeological record on settlement phase domestic mammals in Iceland and\nGreenland, compared with data from Norway. Domestic mammals in the North Atlantic islands were first introduced\nby people and were the key agents of environmental impact.\nof rapid environmental change. By the eleventh through\ntwelfth centuries in Iceland, farming strategies seem\nto have altered, largely omitting pigs and goats and\noften (although not always) shifting the balance of cattle\nand sheep. The outline of a later medieval and early\nmodern sheep-and-cattle-based economy better suited to\nthe deforested landscape of later Iceland was beginning\nto emerge soon after AD 1000. In all periods, dairy\nproduction appears to have been the main objective of\ncattle husbandry, while the different roles of sheep in\nproduction of milk, meat, and wool remains an active\nresearch question.\nIn Greenland the later landna\u00b4m of around AD 985\u2013\n1000 again transferred northwest European domestic\nstock to a new set of North Atlantic landscapes, moving\nthis farming strategy farther into the low Arctic. Inter-\nestingly, it would appear that high status Greenlandic\nlandna\u00b4m settlers at W51 Sandnes in the northern (and\nmore Arctic) Western Settlement, did not apparently at-\ntempt to duplicate the contemporary stock-raising pattern\nof contemporary Iceland, but instead the option of a\npig and cattle-rich farmyard, reminiscent of Norway or\nnorthern Britain. Pigs in Greenland rapidly disappeared,\nalthough goats remained common throughout the rest\nof the settlement period (McGovern and others 1983;\nMcGovern 1985; Enghoff 2003).\nWhile the farming strategy of the landna\u00b4m era settlers\ndrew on millennia of farming experience in northwest\nEurope and perhaps inevitably showed a recurring tend-\nency to impose familiar patterns on unfamiliar landscapes,\nthe use of wild species reflected in the settlement\nera archaeofauna shows far greater flexibility. Figure 5\nillustrates the balance of wild and domestic animal bones\nfrom the same set of early sites from Norway, Iceland,\nand Greenland. The role of wild birds, including some\ngreat auk (Alcus impennis L.), in early subsistence in\nsouthern Iceland is striking, and evokes saga accounts\n(written down centuries after landna\u00b4m) of \u2018unwary,\u2019\neasily hunted wild animals during the Settlement period\n(Ve\u00b4steinsson and others 2002). A few walrus (Odobenus\nrosmarus L.) bones found in the Tjarnargata 4 col-\nlection included animals too young to swim, and the\nrecent A\u00f0alstr\u00e6ti collection nearby contained three entire\nwalrus tusks (Woollett and McGovern 2002). Place-\nnames along the Reykjanes peninsula in the southwest\nalso suggest the presence of resident Icelandic walrus\npopulations at landna\u00b4m. In northern Iceland, fresh-water\nfish, including trout (Salmo trutta) and charr (Salvelinus\nalpinus), provided amajor supplement to domestic animal\nproduction. Analysis ofmarine fish bones, recovered from\nall the inland Myvatn sites by Perdikaris (McGovern and\nothers 2001; McGovern and Perdikaris 2002a, 2002b),\nindicates that ninth- through tenth-century inland sites\nwere being provisioned with preserved marine fish caught\nand processed elsewhere. A few fragments of sea-\nmammal bone, including seal (Phocidae sp.) and porpoise\nTHE NORSE LANDN \u00b4AM ON THE NORTH ATLANTIC ISLANDS 29\nFig. 5. The relative importance of domestic mammals and the non-domesticated biota in the archaeofaunal record.\n(Phocaena sp.), were recovered from the late ninth- to\nearly tenth- century layers at Sveigakot (70 km from\nthe sea), further illustrating the interconnected web of\neconomic relationships present even during first settle-\nment. This internal trade or long-distance provisioning\nappears to pre-date the large-scale commercial fisheries of\nthe fourteenth through twentieth centuries, which served\nthe requirements of external trade and tribute as well as\ndomestic consumption (Amundsen and others, in press).\nWhile all the collections from the Myvatn area include\nquantities of egg shell, probably duck (Anatidae sp.), the\nfew bird bones recovered are mainly ptarmigan (Lagopus\nmutus) and sea birds, rather than the adult migratory\nwaterfowl common to the lakeshore. In later historic\ntimes, Myvatn farmers have managed a sustained yield\nof 10,000 eggs per year by taking a single egg from each\nnest and leaving adults undisturbed.\nIn Greenland, seals (Phocidae sp.) and caribou\n(Rangifer tarandus L.) rather than fish provided the\nmain supplement to the farming economy, and even\ninland sites many hours\u2019 walk from salt water (like\nGa\u02dard under Sandet [GUS]; Enghoff 2003) seem to have\nparticipated in communal sealing (seeMcGovern 1985 for\noverview). Smaller farms like W48 became increasingly\ndependent upon sealing, mainly targeting common seals\n(Phoca vitulina) and migratory harp seals (Pagophilius\ngroenlandicus), but their extensive hunting began with\nfirst settlement.\nEnvironmental impacts of the Norse landna\u00b4m\nThe introduction of domestic mammals (as well as the\naccidental introduction of the mouse (Mus musculus) in\narchaeofauna from Iceland and Greenland) had profound\nimpacts on vegetation, soils, and landscapeswhile dramat-\nically boosting the animal biomass of the offshoreAtlantic\nislands. Although all the island groups have produced\nevidence for extirpations in their insect faunas within the\nlast 1000 years (Buckland and others 1983, 1998b; Buck-\nland and Wagner 2001), it is difficult to be certain whether\nthese reflect simple climate change or the environmental\nchanges initiated by the arrival of humans and their\ndomestic animals. Habitats that were once rare became\ncommon, new, broadly synanthropic environments were\ncreated, and others, more natural, were largely destroyed.\nSome local populations of sea mammals were probably\nimmediately disrupted, and the scale of sea-bird predation\nsuggested by the southern Icelandic archaeofauna may\nwell have altered the composition of nesting colonies.\nHowever, the example of the apparent conservation of\nMyvatn waterfowl suggests that initial human impact\non wild species may have been a more complex story\nthan first imagined, and the arrival of humans and their\ndomesticates may not always have been an unmitigated\ndisaster for resident or migratory island species.\nUsing the Mutual Climatic Range method, it was\npossible to show that the small water beetle (Hydraena\nbritteni) was sufficiently marginal in southern Iceland for\n30 DUGMORE AND OTHERS\na 1\u25e6C fall in summer temperatures to lead to its extinc-\ntion (Buckland and others 1983). The disappearance of\nH. britteni in the late fourteenth century suggests that it\ncould have been a victim of \u2018Little Ice Age\u2019 cold periods;\nhowever, the destruction of sheltering birch woodlands\nmay also have played a key role. The main indications\nof the Norse landna\u00b4m in Icelandic pollen records are a\nsubstantial and rapid decline in birch pollen abundance,\nand the expansion of grasses (Gramineae or Poaceae)\nand sedges (Cyperaceae) together with weeds such as\ndocks (Rumex spp.) and members of the carrot family\n(Umbelliferae or Apiaceae) (Hallsdo\u00b4ttir 1987). In some\ndeposits \u2014 for example, at Holt (Buckland and others\n1991a) \u2014 the landna\u00b4m coincides with a layer of Downy\nbirch wood and charcoal. In short, the main vegetational\nimpact at landna\u00b4m was the destruction of large areas of\nwoodland, presumably to clear land for grazing, as well\nas for structural timber and wood for fuel and charcoal.\n\u00b4Olafsdo\u00b4ttir (2001) presented evidence to challenge the\nlong-held assumption, based largely on a brief comment\nby Ari the Wise, that at landna\u00b4m Iceland was thickly\nforested, with woodland extending from the mountains\nto the sea. Quite where the mountains should be taken\nto begin is clearly open to debate. \u00b4Olafsdo\u00b4ttir (2001)\nsuggested that, in fact, forest cover began to diminish\nfrom 3000 BP onwards, probably through climate change.\nHer view is that, although landna\u00b4m did exacerbate the\nongoing degradation of vegetation, it was not the primary\nagent of change. In fact, tephrochronological study of\nsediment accumulation rates in Myvatnshei\u00f0i ( \u00b4Olafsdo\u00b4ttir\nand Gu\u00f0mundsson 2002) suggests that the major post-\nsettlement decline in vegetation cover did not occur until\naround 1500 AD, and that overgrazing only contributed\nto a problem caused essentially by climate change and,\npossibly, the major tephra fall of 1477. This is consistent\nwith the conclusions of Simpson and others (2001),\nwho identified the key role played by unpredictable\nenvironmental changes that result in a mismatch between\ncultural systems and environmental carrying capacity.\nCrucially, soil erosion does increase soon after\nlandna\u00b4m. Tho\u00b4rarinsson (1961) presented some of the\nfirst convincing evidence, based on tephrochronology,\nthat the soil erosion, so typical of the modern landscape,\naccelerated at the time of Norse colonisation. There is\nwidespread evidence of major changes in soil stability\nat landna\u00b4m. These range from Haraldsson\u2019s (1981) data\non an abrupt increase in the inorganic content of peat\nacross Landeyjar, south Iceland, to Dugmore and others\u2019\n(2000) observation of spatially varied changes of sediment\naccumulation rates during the first century of settlement.\nRates of sediment accumulation across this period can\nchange bymore than an order of magnitude and are tightly\nconstrained for the crucial phase of initial settlement by\ntephra layers dated to aroundAD870, 920, and 935,which\nare clearly separated by intercalated aeolian silts. As\nwind erosion is a key process in Iceland post-landna\u00b4m,\nand soil erosion generally takes the form of a loss of area\nrather than quality, sediment accumulation rates in areas\nof surviving soil and vegetation can be used as an effec-\ntive proxy for post-landna\u00b4m rates of erosion. A crucial\ndifference before landna\u00b4m is that before human settle-\nment the very much lower rates of aeolian sediment\naccumulation are unlikely to represent a simple proxy for\nsoil erosion; they are likely to include significant, if not\ndominant, contributions from glacial erosion and, most\nimportantly, tephra formation. The long-term reworking\nof tephra layers deposited in the central highlands will\nhave provided much material for the pre-landna\u00b4m soil\nformation. For example, three large plinian eruptions of\njust one volcano, Hekla, created in excess of 25 km3 of\nsediment (Larsen and Thorarinsson 1977), a volume sim-\nilar to the soils eroded in southern Iceland since landna\u00b4m.\n(This estimate is based on average soil thickness recorded\nin logged profiles and the erosion area calculations of\nthe Iceland Soil Conservation Service.) In this respect,\nlandna\u00b4m resulted in a fundamental change in the process\nof sediment accumulation, making it a process dominated\nby the reworking of soils. In addition, the pattern of soil\ndistribution changed in both a reduction in overall extent\nand the creation of mosaics of soil and exposed substrate.\nThe Norse settlers were responsible for the introduc-\ntion of numerous species to the flora of Iceland, and in\nthis way they increased floral diversity. Although they\nare not known to have brought about any extinctions\namongst the flora, the settlers did have a negative impact\non biomass. Before the settlement, soils were much more\nwidespread than at present; copious evidence exists to\nshow that farming could take place in areas that are now\nsemi-desert, with minimal plant cover consisting of a\nfew species of grass and small herbs. Relatively high-\nbiomass woodland was replaced by heath, grassland, or\neroded patches. Biodiversity suffered in the sense that,\nalthough the absolute number of species in Iceland as a\nwhole probably increased, the impoverishment of many\nhabitats probably led to a decrease in the average number\nof species in a given area of land.\nIn Iceland and Greenland it is probable that the initial\nreaction of incoming farmers, faced with deep litter, dead\nwood, and limited grass hay, would be to burn in order to\nextend areas of grass growth. The impact of its burning\ncan be found as a thin black line in the peat bogs of\nthe Western Settlement. At many sites in Greenland the\nvegetational response to landna\u00b4m appears very muted.\nTo some extent this may reflect the fact that sample\nsites, even if situated close to former Norse settlements,\nare often lakes with moderately large pollen catchments.\nThe local changes happening at the farms themselves are\nmasked by the signature from the regional vegetation,\nwhich appears to have been less drastically affected than\nin Iceland or the Faroes. The most important exception to\nthis is a bog at Ujaragssuit, Godtha\u02dabsfjord (Iversen 1934;\nFredskild 1972, 1973), the site of aNorse farm and church,\nwhere landna\u00b4m is marked by a layer of wooden chips and\ncharcoal. Pollen data from this site show an expansion of\ndocks (Rumex spp.) and grasses (Gramineae or Poaceae).\nSimilarly, at Lake Tugtuligssuag (Iversen 1953; Fredskild\nTHE NORSE LANDN \u00b4AM ON THE NORTH ATLANTIC ISLANDS 31\n1973), close to a Norse farm site, the beginning of\nsettlement is marked by the appearance of docks and a\ndecline in some shrubs including willow (Salix sp.) and\nalder (Alnus sp.). Again, a layer of charcoal is visible in the\nsoils of the infield. Two Greenlandic insect extirpations,\nEuaesthetus laeviusculus and Phratora polaris, may\nreflect climate change (Buckland and Wagner 2001).\nTimber was a valuable resource, and burning would\nhave had to be carefully constrained. In \u00deo\u00b4rsmo\u00a8rk in\nsouthern Iceland, pits with the remains of charcoal\nformed from birch show the utilisation of woodland\nwithin a hundred years of landna\u00b4m. As some pollen\nevidence clearly shows (Hallsdo\u00b4ttir 1987), woodland\nrapidly became a more limited resource in Iceland;\nhowever, more than half of Iceland\u2019s farms still had\naccess to woodland in the eighteenth century. Coppice\nhad probably rapidly replaced impenetrable wildwood.\nFragments of these coppiced landscapes remain in the\nsouth in \u00deo\u00b4rsmo\u00a8rk, in the east in Hallormssta\u00f0ur, and in\nthe north in Fnjo\u00b4skadalur (Bjarnason 1980), but for the\nmost part Iceland\u2019s forests have gone, replaced initially\nby grassland and later by bare rock as the soil cover was\nstripped away (Tho\u00b4rarinsson 1961; Arnalds 2000). This\npart of the story lies more with the subsequent grazing\nhistory and woodland mismanagement (Dugmore and\nBuckland 1991; Simpson and others 2001) than with any\ninitial burning. The situation in the Faroes was somewhat\ndifferent, as the islands lacked any primary woodland\ncover except in the few most sheltered areas. Evidence\nfrom Mykines suggests that bird cliffs would have been\ncovered with lush growth of grass (Buckland and others\n1998b). Such coastal landscapes would also have been\nwidespread in Iceland, where the abundance of birds\nand sea mammals was enough to seduce one of the\nisland\u2019s first attempted Norse settlers, Flo\u00b4ki, into thinking\nthat he would need no hay to overwinter his livestock.\nTheir death, and the subsequent coining of the name\n\u2018Iceland\u2019, is probably again to be treated as a foundation\nmyth, like the counterpoint name of \u2018Greenland,\u2019 but\nthe didactic message is clear \u2014 no hay to overwinter\nstock, no farm. In contrast with Iceland, the small amount\nof archaeologically related palaeoenvironmental evidence\nfrom the Faroes (Edwards and others 1998) suggests\nthat winter productivity may have been sufficient for\nstock to be over-wintered without stalling. In southern\nIceland, only the core stock was normally stalled; into\nthe early nineteenth century, the remainder was hazarded\noutside (Mackenzie 1842). Elsewhere, in the more Arctic\nenvironments of the north of Iceland and of Greenland,\nstalling of most if not all animals was probably essential\nto their survival.\nThe pattern that emerges in Greenland is one of an ini-\ntial clearance of shrubs by burning and manual clearance,\nan expansion of grassland at the expense of the shrubs,\nand the appearance of a few weed species, most notably\ncommon\/sheep\u2019s sorrel (Rumex acetosa\/acetosella L.),\nbut also yarrow (Achillea millefolium L.), knotgrass\n(Polygonum aviculare L.) and possibly autumn hawkbit\n(Leontodon autumnalis L.). The end of the settlement\nperiod saw a recovery of shrub taxa. A mineral magnetic\nstudy by Sandgren and Fredskild (1991) showed that,\nat Tasiussaq in southern Greenland, the Norse period\nsaw increased rates of soil erosion, although there was\na considerable lag between the first signs of vegetation\ndisturbance and the onset of detectable soil erosion. It\nseems to be genuinely the case that the Norse settlers\ndid not have such a devastating impact on the soils\nand vegetation of Greenland as they did in Iceland,\nalthoughwhy this should be is not clear, particularly as the\ntwentieth-century rise in sheep farming had considerable\nenvironmental consequences.\nThe apparent disappearance of three insect species\nfrom natural habitats in the Faroes (Calathus micropterus,\nCoelostoma orbiculare, Ochthephilus omalinus [grp.])\nis less easily explained (Buckland and others 1998b),\nand human impact, particularly eutrophication of aquatic\nand riparian habitats, may be partly to blame. The\ncommon denominator of the palynological signature\nof settlement on the Faroes is the first appearance of\ncereal-type pollen. At Lambi (Jo\u00b4hansen 1979, 1985),\nthese cereals comprise first oats (Avena sp.) then barley\n(Hordeum sp.). In most cases, this is accompanied by an\nexpansion of arable weeds, especially various types of\ndock (Rumex acetosa, R. longifolius, R. obtusifolius) and\nplantains (Plantago maritima on Mykines, P. lanceolota\nelsewhere). At Tj\u00f8rnuv\u0131\u00b4k, juniper disappeared, perhaps\nused for fuel and for charcoal production and Dryopteris-\ntype spores also declined dramatically, possibly reflecting\ntrampling by people and livestock. At Hov, a pre-existing\ntall herb flora, comprising meadowsweets (Filipendula\nsp.), marsh marigolds (Caltha sp.), stonecrops (Sedum\/\nRhodiola spp.), the carrot family (Umbelliferae), and the\npolypody family (Polypodiaceae), disappeared, possibly\nas a result of grazing by sheep (Jo\u00b4hansen 1985). At\nTj\u00f8rnuv\u0131\u00b4k, Hannon and Bradshaw (2000) noted that the\ndisturbance signature in the pollen record was strong\nowing to the small size of the islands and the likely\npollen catchment areas. Hannon and others (2001) showed\nthat microscopic charcoal was not present in sediments\nbefore the settlement, as indicated by pollen, and that\ncharcoal occurred in small amounts after landna\u00b4m. In the\nwet, cool climate of the Faroes, where natural fires are\nextremely unlikely, charcoal is thus perhaps one of the\nclearest indicators of human activity.\nSailing across the North Atlantic inevitably provided\nnumerous opportunities for hitchhikers and uninvited\nguests (Sadler and Skidmore 1995), ranging from the\nectoparasites of the people and their domestic animals\nto the flora and fauna accidentally carried in ballast and\ndunnage in the hulls of the boats and in the necessary\nfodder, carried to keep domestic animals alive. On\nlandfall, the thin-walled clinker-built ships needed to be\nbeached and cleaned out to avoid rotting, and the resultant\nmidden provided a beachhead from which the introduced\nbiota could disperse. It is hardly surprising therefore\nthat the dung beetle (Aphodius lapponum) was the\n32 DUGMORE AND OTHERS\nearliest widespread anthropochore in both the Faroese and\nIcelandic landscapes (Buckland 1992).What is surprising,\nparticularly in view of the dung faunal footprint that\nappeared later across North America (Buckland and\nothers 1995a), is the failure of the dung fauna to establish\nitself in the settlement areas of Norse Greenland. This\nmay be a reflection of the general paucity of dung\nprocessors in the real Arctic, but equally it may be\nindicating that the winter stalling of animals, or the\nutilisation of dung as fuel, was more complete in the harsh\nenvironment of southwest Greenland. It should be noted,\nhowever, that fossil insect work on farms in the Eastern\nSettlement is currently limited, with one site E34, close to\nQagssiarssuk (Brattahl\u0131\u00b4\u00f0) currently under investigation.\nThe fodder and dunnage fauna appears to have rapidly\nestablished itself in the farms of the landna\u00b4msmenn.\nAt Holt, on the south coast of Iceland, faunas that are\ncharacteristic of farms and barns through to the last\ncentury were established shortly after landna\u00b4m (Buckland\nand others 1991a), although differences from the modern,\npre-plastic roll silage faunas have been the source of some\ndiscussion (Buckland and others 1991b). These faunas\nare dominated by the processors of hay, largely feeding\non the fungi on the decaying plants, and their predators.\nThe faunas include the beetles Laemostenus terricola,\nOmalium rivulare, O. excavatum, Xylodromus concinnus,\nPhilonthus politus, P. cephalotes, Quedius mesomelinus,\nCryptophagus spp., Atomaria spp., Lathridius minutus\nand L. pseudominutus. This fauna appears to be largely\nabsent in the one landna\u00b4m farm examined on the Faroes,\nat Toftanes, perhaps a reflection of the lack of stored\nhay for the winter (Edwards and others 1998). Part of\nthis synanthropic fauna reached Greenland, and became\nextinct along with their involuntary hosts (Bo\u00a8cher 1988).\nIn the more foul residues, including house floors in\nGreenland, the carrion-feeding fly, Heleomyza serrata,\nis so common that it has been christened the \u2018Viking\nHousefly\u2019 \u2014 the true housefly, Musca domestica, is a\nmuch later emigrant across the North Atlantic (Skidmore\n1996). In Greenland, the fly Telomarina flavipes is also\nan occupant of house floors (Buckland and others 1994),\nintroduced at landna\u00b4m and destined for extinction as the\nfarms cool down on abandonment and the outdoor fauna\nmoved in.\nIn terms of the balance book of species, human in-\ntroductions, both temporary and more permanent, wholly\noutweigh extinctions, and the present landscapes of all\nisland groups reflect the large-scale impact of introduced\nherbivores. Dugmore and Buckland (1991) coined the\nterm \u2018ovigenic landscape\u2019 to describe these essentially\nartificial landscapes that are the consequence of human\nenvironmental impact.\nConclusions\nThe limited diversity of North Atlantic island biota\npre-landna\u00b4m and the domination by generalist and\/or\nmore eurytopic species is a reflection of their modes\nof origin. It means that ecological changes are less\ncomplex than in more temperate mainland regions with\nhigher diversity, and that climate change may not always\nproduce a response beyond ecotonal areas. A major\necological impact of landna\u00b4m on the Faroes and Iceland\nwas the introduction of grazing mammals that rapidly\ncame to create new, eroded landscapes. Habitats that were\nonce rare became common, new, broadly synanthropic\nenvironmentswere created, and others,more natural, were\nlargely destroyed. Biodiversity suffered in the sense that,\nalthough the absolute number of species on the islands\nas a whole probably increased, the impoverishment of\nmany habitats probably led to a decrease in the average\nnumber of species in a given area of land, away from that\ndirectly impacted by farms and hayfields. Effective chro-\nnologies can be constructed to correlate pre-settlement\nand settlement period events across the Atlantic islands,\nthrough a combination of archaeological, palaeoecolo-\ngical, historical, radiocarbon, and tephrochronological\nmethods. Each approach has strengths and limitations\nbut in combination they may be used to produce an\nunusually strong chronological framework founded on\nthe widespread dispersal of landna\u00b4m tephra erupted in\nAD 871\u00b1 2.\nProgress in understanding requires both new data and\nmodified approaches to data integration and analysis. One\nchallenge is simply to add key data sets to existing studies.\nFor example, the addition of pollen-based reconstructions\nof vegetation history to detailed excavation survey and\nzooarchaeological data in the Myvatn region of Iceland\nwill enable a range of key ideas on landscape change\nand sustainability to be tested. Wholly new data are\nalso needed for key areas that have currently received\nlittle attention. Thus, well-dated, archaeologically related\npalynology and geomorphology, coupled with quanti-\nfied zooarchaeological and archaeobotanical assemblages\nfrom the Faroe Islands, would permit direct and effective\ncomparisons to be made between the Faroes, Iceland\nand Greenland. Likewise, extension of research on the\nNorse Western Settlement in Greenland to the Eastern\nSettlement would provide crucial additional geographical\ndimensions to current knowledge. To date, the Western\nSettlement in general (and one community within the\nWestern Settlement in particular) has received most\nattention. This is significant because the population of\nthe Western Settlement probably peaked at about 1000\npeople, whereas the Eastern Settlement probably reached\namaximumof about 5000. Crucial to the understanding of\nboth landna\u00b4m and, in the case of Greenland, the ultimate\nfailure of landna\u00b4m, are the major centres of population, as\nthese were the probable centres for the decision-making\nprocesses, power, and prosperity and probably marked the\npositions of the ultimate end of the settlement.\nIn addition to substantially or completely new data,\nexisting information can be extended, integrated, and\nanalysed in new ways. In Iceland, for example, gla-\nciers and their forelands have been well-studied, with\nthe construction of detailed glacier histories based on\nTHE NORSE LANDN \u00b4AM ON THE NORTH ATLANTIC ISLANDS 33\ntephrochronology. In key areas, geomorphological as-\nsessments of glacier forelands could be extended into\nneighbouring farm lands, integrated with land-boundary\nand farm-site data to test ideas of the interaction of\nland management (from historical and environmental\narchaeological data), climate (from glacier histories and\npalaeoclimate data), and landscape change (geomorpho-\nlogical and pollen data). All of these records may be\npotentially integrated using tephrochronology, and\/or an\nintensive use of radiocarbon dating.\nThe authors see geographical patterns of change\nthrough time across the Atlantic islands as crucial to the\neffective understanding of environmental sensitivity to,\nand change as a result of, human settlement. Integrated\nmultidisciplinary research holds the prospect of providing\nsuitable data for assessing natural capital and its change\nthrough time, and as a result offering effective insight into\nthe sustainability of long-term settlement.\nAcknowledgements\nThe Leverhulme Trust is thanked for funding this project.\nReferences\nAmundsen, C.
