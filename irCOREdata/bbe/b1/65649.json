One of them, \u2018Simon\u2019, suffers from chest complaints, which he\nattributes to his torture by SPLA soldiers in the early 1990s: according\nto witnesses, he was tied and stretched with ropes as well as beaten.1\nAs a mere headman, he is bitter about the attempted self-promotion\nto full chiefship of his neighbouring sub-chief and town court member,\n\u2018Ezekia\u2019. Ezekia became a chief around the same time that Simon\nsuffered his torture; when the majority of people fled from the SPLA\nto take refuge in the town or in nearby Uganda, the remaining rural\npopulation were told that the SPLA \u2018worked with someone called a\nchief\u2019, and Ezekia was duly selected to perform this role. Torture of\nsuspected GoS informants, as well as provision of food for the soldiers,\nthen reportedly took place within Ezekia\u2019s house. Since the signing\nof the peace agreement in January 2005, there have been increased\ndemands by some local people for the chiefship to be removed from\nEzekia and restored to the hereditary line of chiefs. This process is\nfurther complicated, however, by a deeper layer of local controversy\nregarding the origin of this hereditary line nearly a century earlier with\na chief from outside the senior \u2018first-born\u2019 lineage, remembered for\nstanding up to the Belgian Congolese soldiers who tortured him.\nThe complex histories and debates about a local chiefship may\nseem overly particularistic and irrelevant in comparison to more\nsweeping accounts of the root causes of Sudan\u2019s civil wars (Johnson\n2003). But the argument here is that specific oral histories and\nongoing disputes regarding chiefs in Central Equatoria reveal much\nabout the historical relationship between state and society \u2013 and in\nparticular the mediation with external violence \u2013 which is central to\nunderstanding the legitimacy of local authority (cf. West 1998). The\nmotifs of scapegoats or proxies, sacrifice and curse which feature\nin the local histories also resonate with earlier anthropological and\nhistorical research across Southern Sudan, reflecting the ambivalence of\n\u2018government\u2019 chiefship, and the relations between secular and spiritual\npower and between agnatic and affinal kin structures. More recently,\nthe growing academic consensus about the historical patterns of\nharsh and extractive Khartoum-based government and its \u2018peripheries\u2019\nCHERRY LEONARDI is a Research Associate in the Department of History, University of\nDurham, where she completed a PhD thesis in 2005 on chiefship in Southern Sudan.\n1 For reasons of anonymity, all names have been changed and the villages\/clans are not\nnamed.\n536 VIOLENCE AND CHIEFSHIP IN SUDAN\nhas been furthered by localized studies of the experience of these\npatterns, at the points of linkage between extractive external force\nand local society (Baumann 1987; Hutchinson 1996; Kurimoto 1994;\nJames 1988; Johnson 1994; Simonse 1992, 1998; Willis 2003). By\nthe 1990s, however, the war had interrupted most fieldwork; this\narticle represents the most recent assessment of the effects of the\nSPLA war on local chiefship. The Kakwa and other ethnic groups\nof Yei have also received little attention since featuring in brief\nethnographies of the western Bari-speakers by British officials (Nalder\n1937: 206\u201316), although neighbouring areas have been more recently\nexamined, the Bari by Simonse (1992) and northernUganda by Leopold\n(2005a).\nMore widely, the politico-economic dominance of chiefs in rural\nareas of Africa has increasingly been highlighted as a factor behind\narmed rebellion and civil wars, particularly in terms of the recourse\nto violence by marginalized youth (Ellis, 1999; Fanthorpe, 2001;\nKeen, 2005; Kriger, 1992; Richards, 2005; West, 1998: 151\u20137).\nIf \u2013 as famously argued by Mamdani (1996) \u2013 chiefs are everywhere\na legacy of the decentralized despotism of the colonial state, then it\nwould not be surprising if violent rebellion were the outcome of the\nfailure of post-colonial states to effectively reform and democratize\nrural local government and landholding. From this perspective, the\nliberation of the oppressed subjects of chiefs into citizens of the\nnation state would perhaps be the final stage of the independence\nstruggle, so that the punishment or replacement of chiefs by the\nSPLA soldiers might be read as an important aspect of the liberation\nstruggle in Southern Sudan; after all, it is widely agreed that\nchiefship originated in the colonial period, and chiefs have mediated\nwith a succession of repressive and exploitative governments since\nthen. But this would assume both that the SPLA had a legitimate\npopular mandate to reform chiefship, and that the chiefs themselves\nhad no moral legitimacy. The reality, however, appears to be the\nreverse.\nTo understand why, it is necessary to grasp the somewhat paradoxical\nhistory of the chiefship and its relationship to the violence of\n\u2018government\u2019. The two chiefdoms which form the subject of this article\nare particularly useful because the way that people talk about local\nauthority makes explicit parallels between the early colonial period\nand the recent conflict. This history has produced an ongoing local\ndebate between those who argue that chiefship has been \u2018bought with\nblood\u2019 through the courage and sacrifice of certain mediators with\nforeigners, and those who argue that these mediators were not from\nthe senior patrilineal clans and should only have held the chiefship\nas a temporary expedient during dangerous times. The informants\nengaged in this debate are largely elders or members of the rival\nchiefly lineages, and their contention provides a contrast with the\nresignation or lack of interest displayed by other informants \u2013 a contrast\nin itself revealing of the historical accommodation reached between\nVIOLENCE AND CHIEFSHIP IN SUDAN 537\nideals about authority and the pragmatic need for a mediator with\ngovernment.2\nLocal debates over who is the rightful chief contain a deeper question,\nof relevance to post-war \u2018reconstruction\u2019: during periods of violent\ndepredation, may norms be pragmatically but temporarily suspended,\nto be followed by a restitution of patrilineally derived authority? Or is\nthere something more permanently normalized about the harsh nature\nof external\/government force, so that the chiefship is inherently derived\nfrom its capacity to deal with this force? The debate also concerns\nquestions of identity and authority: whether the community is defined\nby an exclusive notion of patriclans, or by a more flexible association\nof paternal and maternal kin and married-in outsiders. In contrast to\nGiblin\u2019s account of chiefs in Tanzania (2005a, 2005b), the chiefs in\nCentral Equatoria have not controlled patrilineal clan histories but\nhave retained a marginal status in these internal structures, despite\nbecoming hereditary. Nor have they been from the landowning clans\nand hence the primary focus of agrarian class tensions, as in Sierra\nLeone (Richards 2005). Their ideal role \u2013 it will be argued \u2013 has been\none of speaking and converting between the ways of government and the\nways of the community, including mediating the violence of government\nby deflecting it with their words and, if necessary, absorbing it in their\nown bodies. This article begins by examining the role of the chiefs\nin relation to the recent violence of the SPLA war, and the resulting\ndebates in two chiefdoms in Central Equatoria, before looking at the\noral histories being utilized in these debates and the historical context\nfor patterns of violence and local government.\nTRADITION AND STATE\nBefore turning to the paradoxes of local chiefships however, it is\nworth highlighting the wider context in which such debates have been\ntaking place. Somewhat belatedly, scholars have been addressing the\n\u2018resurgence\u2019 of \u2018traditional authorities\u2019 across Africa since the 1990s. As\nFanthorpe wrote in 1998, \u2018analysis of chiefdoms as local political arenas\nis long overdue\u2019. From South Africa to Nigeria, studies of the revival\nor resilience of traditional authorities have demonstrated the dangers\nof such sweeping generalizations as Mamdani\u2019s, whilst at the same\ntime grappling with the ubiquity of these institutions.3 The strongest\ncomparative work has moved on by focusing on the varied and dynamic\nrole of chiefs as \u2018brokers\u2019 or \u2018double gatekeepers\u2019, converting between\nstate and locality (Ray and van Rouveroy van Nieuwaal 1996; van\nRouveroy van Nieuwaal and van Dijk 1999). Yet scholars also return to\n2 Informants of the former kind were largely recorded through formal interviews and will be\ncited; the latter (especially younger people and women) were accessed more through informal\nconversations, which cannot usefully be cited.\n3 A sample of the literature includes: Goheen 1992; Nyamnjoh 2004; Ray 1996; van Kessel\nand Oomen 1997; Vaughan 2000, 2005; West and Kloeck-Jenson 1999.\n538 VIOLENCE AND CHIEFSHIP IN SUDAN\nMamdani\u2019s distinction between citizens and subjects, asking whether,\nas brokers, chiefs are also implicated in narrow state patrimonialism,\nand whether therefore their resurgence may entrench a (colonial-style)\nsystem whereby access to rights and resources is confined to recognized\nmembers of a \u2018community\u2019, defined by its chief (Buur 2004;West 1998).\nWhile the strong links between urban-centred government and home\nvillages lead Geschiere and Gugler (1998) to conclude that everyone\nis \u2018both citizen and subject\u2019, Fanthorpe (2001) focuses on youth in\nSierra Leone who were \u2018neither citizen nor subject\u2019 as a result of the\nexclusionary legacy of colonial chiefdom policies. Different analyses\nhave emerged of the relationship between chiefs and rebel forces even\nwithin the same country, as is apparent for Zimbabwe (Alexander 1996;\nKriger 1992; Lan 1985), Mozambique (Alexander 1997; McGregor\n1998; Schafer 2001; West and Kloeck-Jenson 1999), and most recently\nfor Sierra Leone: Richards (2005; cf. Keen 2005: 41\u20132, 60\u20139) concludes\nthat resentment towards a chiefly elite motivated excluded rural youth to\njoin armed groups, but Fanthorpe (2006) argues that chiefship, however\ncontested, has continued to be valued by the rural poor because it is\nthe one political institution upon which they can exert some leverage. It\nseems that chiefship is contingently situated somewhere along the gamut\nfrom exclusionary restriction of access to rights, land and justice, to\nan institution more morally legitimate and popularly accountable than\nany government office. This is why academics reiterate the need for\nresearch into local complexity \u2013 the grey shades (West 1998) \u2013 rather\nthan continent- or even country-wide blueprints.\nPolicy makers in the international community have also shifted their\nfocus more towards decentralization and grassroots empowerment,\nincluding a role for traditional authorities, in their efforts to create a\n\u2018liberal peace\u2019 (Duffield 2001; Lutz and Linder 2004; West and Kloeck-\nJenson 1999). The idea that traditional authority may have blueprint\npotential is apparent in the recent (August 2006) \u2018tour\u2019 of South\nAfrica, Botswana and Ghana by Southern Sudanese chiefs to meet\ntheir \u2018counterparts\u2019, sponsored by UNDP and other organizations.4\nThe paradoxes of this approach in Southern Sudan are also becoming\napparent, however. Consultant research has been eager to highlight\nthe newly recognized democratic and consultative nature of chiefs and\ntheir courts, yet has also been forced to note certain incompatibilities\nwith international law, women\u2019s and children\u2019s rights andWestern-style\ndemocracy (UNDP 2005; World Vision 2004).\nOf course the proponents of \u2018liberal peace\u2019 are more comfortable\nwith the concept of \u2018civil society\u2019 organizations which make collective\nclaims for rights on the basis of age, gender, occupation or religious\nor social affiliation, rather than ethnic or local communities. But rural\npeople tend to associate leading members of \u2018civil society\u2019, along with\ninternational organizations, with the government; all are part of an\nurban and bureaucratic sphere from which both \u2018development\u2019 and\n4 \u2018Traditional Leaders on Tour\u2019, August 2006:<http:\/\/www.gurtong.org>.\nVIOLENCE AND CHIEFSHIP IN SUDAN 539\nwar have come (the latter more than the former). As Alexander (1997)\nshows for Mozambique, fear and coercion \u2013 not democracy \u2013 have been\nthe norm of government, and it is in this context that local politics\nshould be approached; the state was to be avoided if it could not be\nprofitably joined. Chiefs in the main have not been seen to belong to\nthis sphere, though they interact with it, which may be the reason why\nthey have provided an apparent continuity in local authority and dispute\nresolution even during the war. This continuing role has contradicted\nthe tendency of international policy makers to presume that violence\ndestroys all cohesion, leaving the slate wiped clean for their interventions\nin governance (cf. Duffield 2001), a concept that was utilized in the early\ncolonial period by British officials. The chiefs have proved surprisingly\nresilient, despite being the focus of coercive colonial polices in the 1930s\nand 1940s, and despite the subsequent move to elected councils from\nthe late colonial period, which culminated in the attempted eradication\nof chiefs in the 1971 Local Government Act.5\nThe Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Movement (SPLM) has also\ncommitted itself to maintaining traditional authorities (SPLM 2004),\nthough with much debate as to the extent of their powers; the proposed\n\u2018House of Nationalities\u2019 has so far been restricted to state rather than\nnational level.6 Individual SPLM\/A leaders differ quite fundamentally\nas to the importance of chiefs, but, like other governments before\nthem, have had to acknowledge their dependence upon these local\nintermediaries, not only pragmatically for tax collection and preserving\nsocial order, but belatedly also for some degree of local legitimization\nof their claims to state power. The \u2018Conference of Chiefs and\nTraditional Leaders\u2019 held in 2004 came up with recommendations\nin support of the SPLM\/A; the first specific ones concerned \u2018war\nmemorials\u2019, suggesting that the chiefs were to help to mythologize\nthe \u2018struggle\u2019. Unfortunately the history of the war has left many\nchiefs less than amenable to simply rubber-stamping the new regime\n(even if it literally gave them their rubber court stamps); already\nthey have been publicly protesting against government corruption.7\nThe interim constitution has left the specifics of traditional authority\nfunctions and laws to the individual state governments. The chiefs\nin Southern Sudan defy categorization and easy definition, because\nthey embody the complicated relationships and bargains hammered\nout between people and military\/governments over the last century and\na half.\n5 In 1974 there was reportedly \u2018as yet no practicable alternative to the chief\u2019 in the Southern\nRegion (Development Administration Group 1974).\n6 See <http:\/\/www.houseofnationalities.org>.\n7 For example, chiefs spoke at a rally for the state governor in Yei on 14 Septem-\nber 2005, criticizing military and police interference and corruption and the illegal\nexport of teak. A letter (5 August 2006) to the Vice-President purporting to be from\nthe Rumbek chiefs successfully called for the removal of the Lakes State governor:\n<http:\/\/www.gurtong.org\/ResourceCenter\/documents\/pressreleases\/Community-\nLeadersOpenLetterToKiir.asp>.\n540 VIOLENCE AND CHIEFSHIP IN SUDAN\nTHE SPLA AND THE CHIEFS: THE GELA OF THE BUSH AND THE MATAT LO\nGELA\nThe question of local civil administration in SPLA-controlled territories\nduring the war has generated some debate, as summarized by Rolandsen\n(2005: 64\u201371) in his study of the SPLM\/A in the 1990s, which also\nhighlighted the general dearth of knowledge about events on the ground.\nAs Johnson (1998: 66\u20139) shows, chiefs\u2019 courts continued to function\nin the areas penetrated, and increasingly controlled, by the SPLA from\nthe mid-1980s (Hutchinson 1996: 148; Kuol 1997). Around Yei by\nthe 1990s chiefs\u2019 courts functioned rather more in spite of the military\n\u2018administration\u2019 than with its full support; intimidation by soldiers\nand the \u2018Civil Military Administrators\u2019 (CMAs) is said to have been\ncommon. Nevertheless, as Johnson argued, the role of the chiefs has\nbeen crucial to forging the relationship between SPLA and people,\nbecause by working with \u2018chiefs\u2019 the former have slotted into familiar\nhistorical patterns. Support from the civilian population was gained \u2013 if\nit was gained at all \u2013 through a combination of coercion and structural\nrecognizability, rather than ideological identification (cf. Kriger 1992).\nThe violence and military strength of the SPLA convinced people that\nhere was the latest \u2018government\u2019 force with which they needed to forge\na bargain in order to secure protection, and perhaps potential benefits.\nSuch bargaining was the role of the chiefs.\nThe two chiefdoms discussed in this article are located in Yei County,\nin what is now Central Equatoria State, where relations with the SPLA\nhave always been problematic (Johnson 2003: 85\u20137). Because the SPLA\ndid rely upon chiefs for the provision of food and conscripts \u2013 as well\nas to be, by default, the main civil administrators and judges in the\n\u2018liberated areas\u2019 \u2013 local debates about the resulting chiefship actually\nfunction as discourses about the SPLA itself, and the legitimacy of its\ncoerciveness and predations. While informants express loyalty to what\nis seen as the anti-Northern cause, they nevertheless also recount a\nlitany of abuses by SPLA soldiers during the war. Sometimes there\nis considerable pride among the locals who remained in the bush,\nrather than seeking refuge abroad, that they were the \u2018hoe brigade\u2019, the\nMaoist water in which the SPLA swam as fish. But this seems to reflect\nsome effective recent propaganda, as well as the hope of reward; their\nown experiences reveal a much less harmonious relationship between\nsoldiers and civilians. The legacy \u2013 and, some Equatorians would argue,\nthe cause \u2013 of this relationship has been the association of brutality and\nabuse with certain ethnic groups, particularly the Dinka, who were seen\nto dominate the SPLA (even though most soldiers around Yei c. 1990\nwere Nuer: Johnson and Prunier 1993).\nEven leaving aside the question of ethnicity, the very military, as\nwell as alien, appearance and behaviour of the rebels placed them in\nthe familiar historical category of gela, in the Bari language spoken by\nthe Kakwa. The appellation originally meant \u2018white people\u2019, but has\ncome to indicate the government, military, uniforms, town and offices;\nsimilar terms have been adopted across the south for the same bundle\nVIOLENCE AND CHIEFSHIP IN SUDAN 541\nof associated influences. As Simonse (1992: 108) defines it, gela implies\n\u2018the ways and institutions the white man had brought\u2019, so that by the\n1970s it was being applied to Southern government officials too. The\nguerrilla nature of the SPLA necessitated a modification to distinguish\nthem as the \u2018gela of the bush\u2019. This reflected the unprecedented\npenetration of the rural areas by the new kind of gela, their lack of\nurban culture or education (cf. Alexander 1997: 8), and the dubious\nmorality of inhabiting camps in the \u2018bush\u2019 rather than living in the\nvillage.\nThe authorities widely known as \u2018chiefs\u2019 have retained the vernacular\ntitle of matat lo gela (or miri: government\/military), translated variously\nas chief of the \u2018foreigners\u2019, \u2018government\u2019 or \u2018military\u2019, a clear indication\nof the origins of their office. The recent war saw the emergence of a\n\u2018chief of the gela of the bush\u2019, or \u2013 more universally \u2013 \u2018SPLA chiefs\u2019.\nThe exodus of population from Yei Town in 1990, and from villages\nalong the roads, led either to refugee movements into Uganda or Congo,\nor to internal displacement in more remote areas. Chiefs who went into\nexile, died or became too old or ill were replaced, often on the orders\nof SPLA officers. It is difficult to ascertain how much popular consent\nthere really was to their appointment, but informants usually claim that\nnew chiefs were selected by the remaining community, conscious of\nthe need for someone strong to mediate with the soldiers. Older people\nreminisce that the Anyanya rebels of the earlier civil war had relied on\nyoung men in the villages, known as \u2018Fronts\u2019, to gather and transport\nfood to them, but the SPLA themselves came to individual households,\ndemanding and threatening them. In this context, it was preferable to\nfind a chief who, instead, could meet with the soldiers in one place\nand provide them with food collected by him and his headmen from\nthe people. No doubt the military command also recognized the greater\nviability of such a system if they were to retain any civilian population\nin these areas, especially given the attraction of refugee camps across\nthe borders.\nNOT REALLY A CHIEF?\nThe two communities which are the focus of this article both\ngained new chiefs during the 1990s, neither being from the previous\nhereditary line of chiefs. To preserve anonymity they will be referred\nto as Clan One and Clan Two, since these are communities which\ndefine themselves primarily by clan names. They are predominantly\nagricultural communities, and have also been involved in trade, urban\nemployment and labour migration as a result of their proximity to\nthe small but important market town of Yei and to the Uganda\nand Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) borders. They consist\nof straggling settlements reaching up to ten miles from Yei, which are\nsub-divided into smaller settlements also known by sub-clan names, as\nwell as by road mile numbers. The Kakwa language is one of the Bari\ndialects (classified as an Eastern Nilotic language), and the two clans,\n542 VIOLENCE AND CHIEFSHIP IN SUDAN\nalong with another two clans, claim descent from a common ancestor\nwho led a migration westward across the Nile; these four clans maintain\nclose social and ritual relations. They also claim \u2018ownership\u2019 of Yei\nTown (which has long contained an ethnically mixed population). The\nmain chiefs\u2019 courts have been held in town, except during the war.\nLand\/boundary disputes have been the only source of limited conflict\nbetween ethnic groups or clans in the wider area.\nTechnically the two clans are each under a \u2018sub-chief\u2019, but since\nthere is no equivalent vernacular distinction, these will be referred to\nsimply as chiefs. In Clan One, the last long-serving hereditary chief,\nBenjamin, died in the 1970s, and a succession of his relatives also died\nor were deposed by the community for drunkenness or other offences.\nBy the 1990s the last one had become too ill to function as chief, and\nso a headman from another sub-clan, Joseph, was appointed instead to\nwork with the SPLA. In Clan Two, a long-serving chief, Jeremiah, died\nand was also briefly succeeded by his brother, but by 1990 Ezekia was\nappointed as the chief for the population outside the town. Some sub-\nclan or village headmen also remained with their communities in the\n\u2018bush\u2019, though some (like Simon) went to Uganda, and some handed\nover the position to their sons.\nThere is a sense among informants that people generally recognized\nthe need for a particular kind of chief or headman during wartime. One\nheadman in Clan Two declared that he was \u2018too old to manage the laws\nof the SPLA\u2019 and handed over the duties to his son, who explained that\nthe SPLA demanded someone energetic to work with them, to collect\nfood and provide conscripts, otherwise \u2018you will be beaten always or you\nwill even be killed\u2019. 8 There is a common emphasis on the need for a\nchief to shield people from the soldiers: \u2018somebody who could confront\nthe SPLA soldiers without fear, to prevent the civilians being flogged\u2019. 9\nAnother headman from Clan Two explained: \u2018if they came to you for\nfood, you quickly collected the food from the people and gave it to\nthem while they are seated with you, because if they entered the village,\nthey would do damages, raping, robbing\u2019.10 In attempting to play this\nrole of gatekeeper, a number of headmen were beaten badly by the\nsoldiers, and one died as a result. The chiefs, Ezekia and Joseph, were\ntaken for six months\u2019 military training in 1992 and given ranks, which\nis said to have given them greater authority over the ordinary soldiers\n(cf. Johnson 1998: 67\u20138). As trained officers of the \u2018hoe brigade\u2019, the\nchiefs \u2018rescued the people from the hands of the SPLA. . . If the SPLA\nwanted to mistreat the people then the trained chiefs could go to the\ncommanders to inform them about the mistreatment by the SPLA.\u201911\nBut the training also identified the chiefs more closely with a military\nculture: Ezekia explained that he sent his guards to collect food from\n8 Interview 19, 4 October 2005: Headman 1, Clan Two.\n9 Interview 20, 6 October 2005: Headman 2, Clan Two.\n10 Interview 14, 17 September 2005: Headman 1, Clan One.\n11 Interview 13, 16 September 2005: Elder 1, Clan One.\nVIOLENCE AND CHIEFSHIP IN SUDAN 543\npeople, and then had it cooked in his own house, where the soldiers\ncame to eat. His daughter also recalls suspected government spies being\ntortured in the house. More widely in the area, the military training of\nchiefs is said to have made them behave more like soldiers themselves,\nissuing orders and using more force. Even more resented than the\nfood demands was the forced conscription of boys into the SPLA. At\ntimes this was done by mass round-ups, or kashas, but it was also\nincreasingly done by demanding a certain number of recruits from each\nchief or headman. Again, this could protect the population somewhat,\nbecause \u2018good\u2019 chiefs would distribute the conscription to ensure that\nnot all the boys from a particular family were taken. One headman was\nbeaten for his outright refusal to provide the required number, telling\nthe soldiers they would have to \u2018grow boys like trees\u2019 if they wanted\nthat many.12 But although people \u2013 especially the headmen and chiefs\nthemselves \u2013 may now emphasize a bigger picture in which the chiefs as\nshields or gatekeepers ameliorated the direct predation by soldiers on\nthe civilian population, the channelling of demands for food and boys\nthrough the chiefs must nevertheless have generated great resentment\ntowards the latter. As two headmen were aware, \u2018Oh, there were many\ncurses and quarrels from the people, because their children were being\ntaken to die\u2019, and, \u2018If a child who had been taken was killed, it was\nblamed on the chief as the cause.\u201913\nSince the SPLA capture of Yei Town in 1997, the population has\ngradually been returning to the area. With the lengthening peace\nand reduced military interventions in government, there is apparent\nagreement in ClanOne, with Joseph himself assenting, that the chiefship\nshould be returned to the original line, although to which descendant\nit is not yet agreed; there is still a sense of waiting for further returnees\nfrom abroad before decisions can be made. In Clan Two, the dispute\nover the chiefship is more heated, and more complicated. People are\ndivided as to whether Ezekia earned his position by being a \u2018strong\u2019\nchief during the war, or whether he actually has no legitimate claim to\nbe a chief at all. If he were removed, there would still be competition,\nhowever, between two sub-clans with rival claims to the chiefship.\nOne is the senior or \u2018firstborn\u2019 sub-clan, whose members claim to be\ndescended from the eldest son of the founding ancestor. The other\nsub-clan is descended from an adopted \u2018nephew\u2019, allegedly captured\nduring nineteenth-century raids by the senior sub-clan, and from whom\nthe main line of chiefs is descended up to Jeremiah. And, in a final\ncomplication, Ezekia claims a link to the senior sub-clan, but he is\nrelated only on his maternal side: he is a \u2018nephew\u2019, as his opponents\nlike to point out. The discussions of the current chiefship in both clans\ninvariably turn to its origins and history, as they try to make sense of\nthe legacy of the war and the existence of the \u2018SPLA chiefs\u2019.\n12 Interview 20, 6 October 2005: Headman 2, Clan Two.\n13 Interview 18, 3 October 2005: Headman 3, Clan Two; Interview 12, 14 September\n2005: Town sub-chief, Clan Two.\n544 VIOLENCE AND CHIEFSHIP IN SUDAN\n\u2018BOUGHT WITH BLOOD\u2019: SACRIFICE OR STEALING?\nThe most striking motif in discussions of both the current and historical\nchiefship is the idea of sacrifice. There are many who argue that the\nchiefship has been earned by individuals who had the courage to face\npotential or real personal danger by meeting with external military\nforces, in order to secure protection for their people. This reflects the\norigins of the chiefship of the gela in the unpredictable and violent\ncircumstances of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and\nespecially at the point when the Turco-Egyptian and Mahdist army\nremnants in the area were succeeded by the \u2018tukutuku\u2019 troops of the\nBelgian Congo, during the brief existence of the Belgian Lado Enclave.\nThe Enclave officers had a reputation for brutality among British\ncolonial officials at the time, as well as in local memories.14 Like other\nforeigners before them, they sought out \u2018chiefs\u2019 or \u2018sheikhs\u2019, but being\nidentified as such tended to place an individual first in the firing line,\nas one visiting British hunter found when he accepted assistance from a\nBelgian military post:\nWithout any preliminary enquiry, the sheikh was seized and severely beaten,\nthe Officer himself taking a leading part in belabouring the unfortunate man\non the head, back or legs, indiscriminately. Having been thus treated he was\nordered to show where the game was to be found.15\nNineteenth-century accounts by Europeans also suggest that those\nidentified as \u2018sheikhs\u2019 had risked being punished, tortured or killed by\nthe ivory and slave traders or the forces of the Egyptian government\n(Baker 1874, 2: 69\u201370; Gordon 1899: 72, 125; Wilson and Felkin 1882,\n2: 128). It was probably common, therefore, for relatively marginal\nmen (or even some women) to take on the role of negotiating with\nthe foreigners, especially if they had picked up some Arabic through\ntrade or contact with the zeriba military camps. British officials in\nboth the Turco-Egyptian and Condominium governments occasionally\nrecognized that such an intermediary was \u2018not the real sheikh\u2019 (Baker\n1874, 1: 338). An example made famous by Samuel Baker\u2019s accounts\nwas his adversary \u2018Allorron\u2019, who was actually the local Bari agent of\nan Egyptian trading firm and represented the rise of what Simonse\n(1992: 93\u2013101) has termed \u2018cargo chiefs\u2019. The latter were part of an\nemerging class of Bari middlemen, including soldiers and translators,\nand were expected to use their privileged access to the traders to obtain\nsome protection for their people as well as personal profit. Allorron\u2019s\nheadmen told Baker that \u2018although Allorron had been the ostensible\nsheikh for a great length of time, the true sheikh by actual descent was\n14 For example, Logan, Mongalla, to Assistant Director Intelligence, Khartoum, 25\nDecember 1905, National Records Office, Khartoum (hereafter NRO), Mongalla Province\n1\/8\/50; Wood, Bahr El Ghazal Intelligence Report, 30 April 1904, NRO Intelligence 8\/2\/9;\nSudan Intelligence Report 138, January 1906, Public Records Office, London (hereafter PRO),\nWO 106\/228.\n15 Sudan Intelligence Report 155 June 1907, PRO WO 106 229.\nVIOLENCE AND CHIEFSHIP IN SUDAN 545\na chief named Morbe\u2019 (Baker 1874, 1: 255\u20137). Already in the 1870s,\nthen, some of the proto-chiefs who negotiated with new commercial\nand military influences stood outside authority based on blood descent.\nSimilarly, in the Yei area to the west a few semi-Arabized local ex-\nsoldiers or translators had become prominent as intermediaries with\nthe foreigners, and were recognized as \u2018chiefs\u2019 by the Belgian colonial\nofficers in the early twentieth century. The origin of the chiefship of\nClan One is linked in local histories to the establishment of government\noffices in what became the town, which at that time is said to have been\ninhabited by the rain chief (matat lo kudu) of Clan One, Aligo.16 His\nwife Awate is central to the story, and indeed it is in her granary that\nthe \u2018eggs\u2019 which produced rain are said to have first appeared. When\nthe soldiers arrived, the people fled to take refuge in caves in the hills,\nbut Awate came out to confront them. Perhaps \u2013 like a woman who had\ncome to negotiate with Baker during a raid (Baker 1874, 1: 331) \u2013 she\nbelieved that a woman was less likely to be killed. But she was captured\nby the soldiers, her hands were amputated and her child killed. Aligo\nthen came to negotiate her release, and agreed to move his settlement\na short distance to vacate land for the government offices. In return he\nwas \u2018given\u2019 the chiefship by the Belgian forces; he in turn gave it to a\nbrother, Mabe, and their respective lines have continued to hold the\nrain and government chiefships, until the appointment of Joseph to the\nlatter under the SPLA.\nIn Clan Two, various versions of history all emphasize that the senior\nlineage headed by Balla feared the foreign forces and sent Ciwa or Lasu\nto negotiate or to rescue captured women, and return with a flag and\nthe chiefship. Later Balla handed over the chiefship to Lasu, who was a\n(maternal) nephew or the son of a Lugbara \u2018captured and brought from\nthe bush\u2019.17 Balla declared that Lasu had earned it by his bravery and\ncursed anyone who tried to take back the chiefship in the future. Lasu\u2019s\ncourage and \u2018stubbornness\u2019 (defiance) is widely remembered: \u2018when the\nFrench [Belgians] came they were beating Lasu, and they smeared his\nface with honey and burnt it with fire, but still he persevered\u2019.18 The\ncurse against reclaiming the chiefship has not prevented some of Balla\u2019s\ndescendants from insisting that it should have been returned to them\nafter Lasu\u2019s death, but one such contender is believed to have fallen\nvictim of the curse in the 1970s.19\nThe theme of risking death \u2013 and even of blood sacrifice \u2013 is thus\nprominent in histories of the chiefship. Although the immediate violence\nof the early colonial days diminished until the recent civil war, a feeling\n16 I translate matat as \u2018chief\u2019 \u2013 whether of rain or government \u2013 since the same word is used\nin the vernacular. Rain chiefs perform rituals using grinding stones and gourds to beseech or\nprevent rainfall, and do not appear to have had the extent of authority of the Bari rain \u2018kings\u2019\ndescribed by Simonse (1992).\n17 Interview 20, 6 October 2005: Headman 2, Clan Two.\n18 Interview 9, 10 September 2005: Headman 4, Clan Two.\n19 Interview 19, 4 October 2005: Headman 1, Clan Two; Interview 33, 31 October 2005:\nElder 1, Clan Two.\n546 VIOLENCE AND CHIEFSHIP IN SUDAN\nhas lingered that the chiefship carries an inherent danger, sometimes\nexplicitly described as a \u2018curse\u2019. This is similar to, though not as\nstarkly defined as, the curse on colonial chiefs in neighbouring Arua\nin northern Uganda (Leopold 2005b: 221\u20132). But while in Arua the\nbloodshed associated with foreign forces led to a curse on those who\ncollaborated with government, in the Yei clans this is countered by\nthe blood sacrifice of the chiefly families themselves. In Clan One,\nsince Awate\u2019s child was first killed, and especially since the 1970s, a\nnumber of chiefs or their family members have died, leading one elderly\nlady to defy any rival to lay claim to the chiefship: \u2018Count out your\ndead people who were slaughtered, through whom the chiefship was\nobtained! Count your dead ones, your blood poured!\u201920 The younger\nmembers of the lineage are said to be afraid to take on the position;\nsimilarly in Clan Two: \u2018The youth have been traumatized by the deaths\nof those who were made chiefs; they think that they will also die like\ntheir fathers if they hold the chiefship.\u201921 And supporters of the \u2018SPLA\nchiefs\u2019 argue that they too have earned the chiefship through personal\nsacrifice and risk; Ezekia\u2019s position was \u2018bought with blood\u2019, claimed\nhis son.22 Chief Joseph of Clan One similarly explained that during the\nwar \u2018you bail difficult issues with blood\u2019.23\n\u2018THE CHIEFSHIP OF FOOD\u2019\nWhether or not some Christian imagery has crept in, the idea is striking:\nthe chief \u2018bails\u2019 his people from military\/government punishment with\nhis own blood. (More literally, chiefs in Juba became responsible for\nbailing people from torture and detention by the GoS in the 1990s.)24\nThe idea of a contract is central to understanding the position of the\nchief in the relationship between government and local communities.\nThe chiefship was clearly objectified as a \u2018thing\u2019 that was brought from\nthe government by the first chiefs, symbolized particularly by flags. It\nis sometimes described as a \u2018burden\u2019 carried by them (cf. Kuol 1997:\n28\u201330). But it is also an object which is seen to confer certain rights\nupon the people belonging to each chiefdom; Aligo\u2019s agreement to\nvacate land for the government in return for the chiefship is used by\nClan One to claim leading rights over the town and area, because \u2018our\ngrandfather brought the chiefship . . . [and] founded this place . . . where\nour iron column is\u2019 [perhaps the base of a flag pole].25 The perceived\nautonomous existence of the chiefship is also apparent in the claim by\n20 Interview 10, 12 September 2005: Elder Woman, Clan One.\n21 Interview 33, 31 October 2005: Elder 1, Clan Two.\n22 Interview 4, 30 August 2005: Chief Ezekia and son, Clan Two.\n23 Interview 24, 12 October 2005: Chief Joseph, Clan One.\n24 Interview 37, 30 November 2005; Interview 38, 1 December 2005: Chiefs in Juba.\n25 Interview 6, 5 September 2005: Town sub-chief, Clan One.\nVIOLENCE AND CHIEFSHIP IN SUDAN 547\nsome members of Balla\u2019s line in Clan Two that \u2018the chiefship has come\nback to us on its knees\u2019, in reference to Ezekia holding it.26\nSo what does this object \u2018given\u2019 by the government signify? In a sense\nit symbolizes a bargain, whereby people have consented tacitly to the\ndemands of the gela in return for a measure of security and a degree\nof control over how those demands would be met. In turn, they gave\nthe chiefs a mandate to execute government demands provided that\nthe chiefs acted as the tool whereby such control could be exerted, to\nameliorate the worst government depredations. This notion is obvious\nin more recent times, when people clearly agreed with the SPLA on the\nneed for an intermediary to deflect some of the violence of the soldiers.\nBut it also comes through in the oral histories, and in numerous\ninstances in the colonial records when chiefs were reported to defend\nor, more often, hide the transgressions of government orders by their\ncommunities; they were often punished by the government for the\nactions of the people.\nMore widely in Central Equatoria, this potentially dangerous or\ndemeaning role was often rejected by senior elders and spiritual leaders\nlike rain chiefs, who instead delegated \u2018clients or outsiders\u2019 to conceal\nand protect them from government (Buxton 1963: 65; Leonardi\n2005). Later, mission-educated young men who knew the \u2018ways of\ngovernment\u2019 were appointed (cf. Hutchinson 1996). For \u2013 although in\nthe later colonial period there were reports of tax embezzlement by\nchiefs \u2013 the opportunities for profit have always been rather limited.\nThe ability to requisition labour for their own cultivation was the most\nnotable, but even this was understood as part of the contract between\nchief and people; if the chief was busy with \u2018government\u2019 work, the\ncommunity should cultivate for him to maintain his important capacity\nfor hospitality.27\nIf not bought by blood, then, the chiefship was bought by food,\naccording to oral histories which emphasize the readiness of certain\nindividuals \u2013 including Lasu \u2013 to provide hospitality and food for the\nforeigners. And increasingly during the colonial period, the chiefs had\nto provide tribute and later taxes to the government. The SPLA war\nsaw a return to the collection of tribute in kind rather than cash, and for\nthis reason Ezekia has been described as holding the \u2018chiefship of food\u2019:\n\u2018he just stole it . . . [by] feeding the gela of the bush\u2019.28 Similarly, another\nopponent explained that \u2018He was the one who fed the SPLA, so then he\nwas made a caretaker of the SPLA, but he is not actually a chief.\u201929 Even\nEzekia himself offered the same explanation: \u2018They selected me because\n. . . I was a hospitable man. I fed them throughout the night, cooking\nday and night, and they said you [the villagers] have found a person, he\n26 Interview 20, 6 October 2005: Headman 2, Clan Two.\n27 Fanthorpe (2006: 36) questions Richards\u2019s (2005) argument that chiefs\u2019 labour demands\nwere overly exploitative in Sierra Leone.\n28 Interview 33, 31 October 2005: Elder 1, Clan Two.\n29 Interview 11, 13 September 2005: Elder 2, Clan Two.\n548 VIOLENCE AND CHIEFSHIP IN SUDAN\nwill be your chief.\u201930 An intrinsic aspect of being a chief has involved the\nability to extract \u2018food\u2019 from the people to give to the government, and\nthis has perhaps always rendered their legitimacy questionable. Ezekia\nand others argue that it was much better in the first Anyanya war when\nthe rebels relied on a young \u2018Front\u2019 to \u2018take care of their hunger\u2019, since\nhe was subordinate anyway and the chief could remain above such\nmatters. It was after all this kind of government work that the elders and\nrain chiefs sought to delegate to younger \u2018chiefs\u2019 in the early colonial\nperiod, and which had limited the status of the latter. But there has also\nbeen a deeper aspect of the \u2018hospitable\u2019 role of the chief; in receiving\npotentially dangerous visitors, he could deflect their violence. As one\nfamous chief from a neighbouring ethnic group reportedly declared to\nthe GoS when accused of supporting the SPLA: \u2018I am a chief. If the\nSPLA come, I give them food, and if the Government soldiers come, I\ngive them food. I am a chief, not a fighter: I receive people.\u201931\nBLOOD DESCENT OR BLOOD POURED\nThe idea of the curse of chiefship relates to its moral ambiguity, because\nthe moral relations of the government are seen to operate on an entirely\ndifferent basis from those of the village. In the light of this, it is difficult\nto know whether the marginality of the chiefs to the \u2018norms\u2019 of lineage\nauthority contributed to this \u2018cursed\u2019 ambiguity, or whether in fact those\nnorms have been constructed subsequently as a counter-discourse to\nthe power of the chiefs. Giblin (2005a, 2005b) demonstrates how\nchiefs in colonial Tanzania developed discourses of patriarchal clan\nauthority in order to define the community and their own status, which\nwere ultimately at odds with the more flexible community relations\noperating in practice. But in Clan One, and especially in Clan Two,\nchiefship by its origins and functions has stood outside or on the edge\nof such discourses, even though it is frequently debated in a clan-\ncentred idiom. Komma (1998) similarly shows that Kipsigis chiefs in\nKenya were \u2018marginal men\u2019 like adopted foreigners (and like earlier\npeacemakers), whose power was checked by the curse of clan elders.\nThe chiefship of Clan One was obtained through the actions of a\nwoman who came from another clan; Awate confronted the soldiers\nand it was her sacrifice of her hands and her child which is actually\nupheld as the bloody price paid for the chiefship: \u2018The chiefship was\ngiven to the husband because chiefship cannot be given to a woman. . .\nThey gave him the chiefship because his wife\u2019s handswere amputated.\u201932\nThis is far removed from an ideal of authority based on blood descent\nthrough first-born males, which is how rain chiefship, landowning and\nsome claims to government chiefship have come to be defined. In Clan\n30 Interview 2, 23 August 2005: Chief Ezekia, Clan Two.\n31 Interview 6, 5 September 2005: Town sub-chief, Clan One.\n32 Interview 7, 7 September 2005: Rain chief, Clan One.\nVIOLENCE AND CHIEFSHIP IN SUDAN 549\nTwo, the chiefship was obtained not by a woman but by a nephew or\noutsider, Lasu. Parallels with Ezekia\u2019s current chiefship are explicitly\ndrawn, because he is also \u2018only\u2019 a maternal nephew to the senior clan\nlineage: \u2018there were a lot of troubles [because] they [the clan] felt they\nwere being ruled by a nephew\u2019.33 Members of Balla\u2019s family are faced\nwith a particular conundrum; they have welcomed back the chiefship\n\u2018on its knees\u2019 in the person of Ezekia because he is related to them, and\nyet if they justify handing the chiefship to a nephew, they risk justifying\nthe original handover to Lasu, which they now dispute.\nThe derisive references to nephews disguise the complexity of\nrelations between patriclans and maternal kin, which has been famously\ndiscussedmore widely in Southern Sudan by anthropologists. Lienhardt\n(1955) used Shilluk and Anuak examples to question Radcliffe-Brown\u2019s\n(1952) analysis of the \u2018mother\u2019s brother\/sister\u2019s son\u2019 relationship in\nSouth Africa as affectionate and supportive, showing some of the\npotential political tensions between agnatic royal clans and the power of\nmother\u2019s brothers. Evans-Pritchard has also been criticized for ignoring\nthe political importance of affinal and matrilateral relations among\nthe Nuer (McKinnon 2000). Lienhardt (1958a) described the Dinka\n\u2018dual chieftainship\u2019 of maternally related spearmasters and war leaders,\nand showed that powerful nuclear spearmaster lineages functioned\nas maternal uncles to the people attached to them. Similarly Evans-\nPritchard (1947: 94) did observe that \u2018stranger\u2019 lineages among the\nAnuak counted as sister\u2019s sons because they married women of the\ndominant clan (cf. Buxton 1963: 61, 103). This is why around Yei the\nterm \u2018nephew\u2019 can apply to \u2018outsiders\u2019 and captives (like Chief Lasu)\nwhose marriage into the clan might also have been paid for by their\npatrons.34 The population displacements of the nineteenth century, like\nthose of the later twentieth, heightened the importance of marriage as\na means of attachment to a dominant patron or lineage, according the\nlatter both power and duties as \u2018maternal uncles\u2019 whose curse is feared\nabove all and yet who are also bound to assist their sister\u2019s sons. It\nis common to meet nephews who have grown up with their maternal\nrelatives (cf. Fanthorpe 1998: 574\u20135). Later though, the \u2018nephew\u2019\nlineages may have sought greater independence by emphasizing their\nown patrilineages, perhaps encouraged by colonial-era developments\nafter the 1930s, when the British colonial administrators suddenly\nfocused on the idea of \u2018clans\u2019.35\nHowever, the British preoccupation with \u2018monarchical\u2019 African\nchiefship also encouraged patrilineal inheritance by chiefs\u2019 sons \u2013 even\nif, as we have seen, the early chiefs were often \u2018nephews\u2019. They in turn\n(rather than risking their own sons as recruits in the first schools, as the\nmissionaries and government had ordered) often sent their nephews,\n33 Interview 18, 3 October 2005: Headman 3, Clan Two.\n34 For example, Interview 34, 1 November 2005: Elder 3, Clan Two.\n35 For example, Governor Nalder, \u2018Mongalla Province Summary of Information\u2019,\nNovember 1933, NRO Civil Secretary 57\/35\/131.\n550 VIOLENCE AND CHIEFSHIP IN SUDAN\nwho sometimes subsequently became the next generation of chiefs. So\nchiefs must have been both restrained and supported by their position\nas \u2018sister\u2019s sons\u2019 to more senior lineages, which is why Ezekia\u2019s maternal\nrelation to the senior lineage in Clan Two is welcomed by some people.\nOn the other hand if chiefs were seen to overstep their position, as\nperhaps during the SPLA war, the senior lineage could (and did)\ncomplain that they should not be ruled by a \u2018nephew\u2019.\nThis oscillating relationship between the force of agnation and the\npower of maternal uncles has thus, as elsewhere in Southern Sudan,\nfunctioned as a check and balance on individual power, somethingwhich\nShilluk royal clans sought to eradicate (Lienhardt 1955). Around Yei a\ntheoretical balance is further maintained by the separation of chiefship\nfrom the rain chiefship, and from landowning. Unlike in Sierra Leone,\nwhere landowning chiefs have dominated the agrarian political economy\n(Richards 2005), aroundYei specific territories or plots with well-known\nboundaries belong to particular sub-clans, understood either to have\nbeen the earliest inhabitants, or to have established such rights by\nburning the grass for hunting. The senior and rain lineages claim a\nmore general authority over the land or soil itself, but when such an\nelder from Clan Two recently claimed a share of profits from land sales,\nthe landowning clan leaders were angered and his subsequent death is\ncommonly ascribed to their curse.36\nThe chiefs have even less claim to any land rights, something which\nmay be misunderstood in the recent constitutional efforts to enshrine\nland rights vaguely with \u2018communities\u2019 and \u2018traditional authorities\u2019\n(cf. West and Kloeck-Jenson 1999: 482\u20133). In particular, NGOs have\nincreasingly recognized the importance of obtaining permission to build\ntheir compounds from the \u2018landowners\u2019, but sometimes assume that this\nsimply means the \u2018chief\u2019. New opportunities are creating new tensions.\nChief Ezekia has seized the opportunity to claim authority \u2013 and share\nin any sales \u2013 over all the land of Clan Two and even the town itself,\nlargely on the basis that he remained in the area during the war: \u2018I did\nnot run. Some have remained as refugees, some have just returned.\nThey found me here, which means in the land here I am guardian of the\nland of my grandfather.\u201937 This comes close to asserting that the war has\nwiped out previous history and that the land has been newly \u2018bought\nwith blood\u2019 rather than belonging to blood descent groups; a claim\nincidentally made by the SPLA soldiers who have settled in the area.\nBut it is not a claim tolerated by local people, who remain committed\nto the landowning system and have roundly condemned land sales and\ninterference in land issues by Ezekia, and by Chief Joseph in Clan\nOne. Even the youth have protested, locally and from as far afield as\nKhartoum.\nThe opposition to Ezekia\u2019s claims to land demonstrates the way that\nclan discourses can seek to impose limits upon the abuse of chiefly\n36 For example, Interview 32, 28 October 2005: Elder 2, Clan One.\n37 Interview 2, 23 August 2005: Chief Ezekia, Clan Two.\nVIOLENCE AND CHIEFSHIP IN SUDAN 551\npower, which is also checked by the separation of powers or offices.\nThere is often strong criticism if a particular office holder attempts\nto mediate with other kinds of power; the most famous rain chief\nin Clan One, who died in the 1970s, has been criticized for also\nworking as a government chief.38 The secularization of chiefship by\ncolonial administrators has been highlighted more widely in Southern\nSudan (Beswick 1998: 258\u201368; Buxton 1963: 83, 90\u20131; Hutchinson\n1996: 116\u201333; Johnson 1986, 1994: 24\u201334). In Yei it is depicted in\nlocal histories as a deliberate internal decision to separate powers or\noffices: chiefs are the busy gatekeepers and peacekeepers but remain\nanswerable to more hidden authorities, particularly if the latter are their\nclassificatory maternal uncles.\nSPEECH AND POWER\nLocal discourses suggest that authority derives from the capacity to\ncommunicate with a source of power, not from possession of power\nin itself, which may help to explain why brute force has rarely been\nconsistently employed by chiefs or other \u2018office holders\u2019. The courage\nand ability of individuals to communicate with the gela is seen to have\nearned them the chiefship, which was then slotted alongside other\nkinds of authority, and confined to \u2018government matters\u2019. Meanwhile\nrain chiefs, senior elders and landowners mediated with divinity and\nancestors through ritual, prayer, curses and their own bloodlines.\nBecause the ancestors and divinity are seen to be the ultimate source\nof moral knowledge, however, their mediators have been able to\nclaim a central role in defining and governing the moral community.\nGovernment, on the other hand, is seen to operate on a different\nmoral basis, and so the chiefs\u2019 internal role in the moral community\nis inherently more marginal. But, as elsewhere in Southern Sudan, the\nchiefs became more significant as they partially usurped the function\nof arbitration formerly performed by spiritual leaders, extending their\ninterstitial position between government and people to insert themselves\nbetween feuding parties, their neutrality perhaps enhanced by their\nmarginal origins. The ability to talk or speak well is widely upheld as\na vital attribute of chiefs in their courts, as of earlier peacemakers (cf.\nEvans-Pritchard 1940: 162\u201376; Johnson 1986; Lienhardt 1958b: 31).\nThe \u2018good speech\u2019 of chiefs thus became valued, both in relation\nto the gela and within the community, as the means by which to\nresolve or prevent violence.39 In the face of the overwhelming force\nof the military\/government, only the chief\u2019s skills of negotiation \u2013 and\nof knowing when not to talk \u2013 could provide any real defence for the\n38 Interview 24, 12 October 2005: Chief Joseph, Clan One. This is also a source of\ncontroversy, for instance, in Rumbek in Lakes State, where a leading \u2018spearmaster\u2019 also took\non a role as \u2018government chief\u2019 in the town court in the 1970s: Interview 65, 29 May 2006:\nRumbek elder.\n39 For example, Interview 8, 9 September 2005: Elder 4, Clan Two.\n552 VIOLENCE AND CHIEFSHIP IN SUDAN\ncommunity. The two long-serving chiefs in Clan One and Clan Two\nwere remembered above all for speaking out, even in government\noffices. The SPLA training of the chiefs was intended \u2018to enable them\nto speak in front of the SPLA; to give you a gun so that you look like a\nsoldier and so that the work would go well in the village\/country\u2019.40\nAs this implies, speaking to the gela to some degree involved mirroring\nsuch force by adopting the languages and symbols of military and offices.\nThe danger, as in the case of Ezekia, has been for a chief to become\ntoo much a mirror of the gela, and thus fail to convert and translate\neffectively between government and people. For the chiefs are respected\nfor their \u2018straight talk\u2019, unlike \u2018tricky\u2019 educated\/government people (cf.\nHutchinson 1996: 270\u201388). It is when chiefs are isolated from their\ncommunities by living in the town and working in more government-\nassociated courts that their interstitial position is lost. As one elder said\nof Chief Ezekia:\nThe chief actually should be with his people, talking to his people, and\nhaving meetings with people in which he can give advice so that people\nstay peacefully among themselves without hatred and grudges. It is not his\nmatter alone; he should call us in. Sometimes he [Ezekia] appears once, like\na ghost, and then disappears forever. And yet the clan is very large and it is\ndifficult to recognize everybody.\nSpecific criticisms made of Ezekia for living in the town and for\nlaying illegitimate claim to authority over land reveal the high degree\nof accountability that communities seek to impose upon chiefs. And\nit is above all the failure of Ezekia to talk with \u2013 and observe the\ndiffuse authorities in \u2013 his community which has led to criticism of\nhim, because it is through speech that the role of the chief derives its\nlegitimacy within the community.\nThe chief has also been expected to bring news of the government to\nthe people, and in particular to bring the \u2018laws\u2019 \u2013 the government\u2019s\nways of resolving conflicts and disputes. The chiefs\u2019 courts have\nbeen the ultimate arena for translation, where the chief has had\nto marry the government\u2019s \u2018laws\u2019 with the moral ideas of the\ncommunity and listen to and summarize the advice of the elders.\nAnd extracting \u2018food\u2019 from the community has involved the art of\npersuasion and bargaining, not simply the use of force. Chiefs have\nsought to depict themselves as merely messengers for the more\nunwelcome exactions, like the SPLA conscription: \u2018it is not the\nchief who took the child; it is the government who wanted the\nchild\u2019.41 \u2018The work of a chief is just a messenger\u2019, according to Chief\nJoseph.42\nThe failure to communicate effectively with government power results\nin violence, however, and often the chiefs have been the first in\n40 Interview 21, 8 October 2005: Sub-chief 1, Clan Two.\n41 Interview 12, 14 September 2005: Town sub-chief, Clan Two.\n42 Interview 24, 12 October 2005: Chief Joseph, Clan One.\nVIOLENCE AND CHIEFSHIP IN SUDAN 553\nline for such punitive force. There are parallels again with the rain\nchiefs\u2019 role of mediation with divinity; their failure to beseech rain\neffectively has sometimes led to violence or death being inflicted\nupon them collectively by the community, as in Simonse\u2019s account\nof the Bari \u2018scapegoat [rain] king\u2019 (1992). Someone must pay the\nprice for breakdown of communication; while at times mediation\nand translation offer opportunities to skilful manipulators, they can\nalso lead to the shooting of the messenger. Violence inflicted on\nthe chiefs and headmen during the war thus represents the ultimate\nbreakdown of communication, and the function of the chiefship as\na kind of safety-valve or scapegoat between the people and the\narbitrary and unpredictable force of government, just as between feuding\nparties.\nThe chiefs\u2019 legitimacy has also rested on the contested definitions of\nthe community. For the normative discourses of the elders and clan\nleaders, while they have been central to defining a moral community,\nhave also tended to be exclusionary. The chiefs\u2019 authority, somewhat\nironically, has been more inclusive and more practical. The fact\nthat \u2013 despite becoming largely hereditary \u2013 it has not been based on\nseniority in the lineage has enabled it to remain more open to political\nchange. The younger or more educated people, who have been calling\nfor chiefs to be democratically elected and more literate, have actually\nbeen arguing very much within a long-standing discourse of chiefship.\nThe idea that a chief should be \u2018for all the people\u2019 rather than clan-\nbiased, and that a chief should be qualified to communicate effectively\nwith government in order to bring both mitigation and resources for\nthe community, appears to be deeply embedded in local political\nculture. Of course it represents more of an ideal than a reality, since\nchiefs have frequently been accused of bias, and since government\nresources have rarely been forthcoming and instead government has\nbeen more or less predatory upon the people. But even from a\nmore realistic angle, the general tacit tolerance for the \u2018SPLA chiefs\u2019,\nalongside the elders\u2019 longing for a return to the true lineage chiefship,\nis deeply revealing of the kind of balance which has been reached \u2013 and\nrenewed \u2013 over the last century or more. It is a compromise between\nthe need to define and defend the local moral community, and the\ninescapable realities both of the recurring predations of \u2018government\u2019\n(whether colonial, \u2018Arab\u2019 or rebel) and of the continually shifting\ncomposition of local communities. The latter in itself reflects the\npragmatic coping mechanisms which have enabled people to draw\non different networks of kin and community in order to survive the\ndisruptions and dangers brought by the gela. And yet, whatever the\npragmatic reality, people nevertheless need the sense of continuity\nand of a moral centre, which the discourses of blood descent, land\nrights and roots provide. It is ultimately revealing that those discourses\nclaim descent from migration leaders during times of displacement and\ndanger, just as the histories of chiefship locate its origins in familiarly\nviolent circumstances.\n554 VIOLENCE AND CHIEFSHIP IN SUDAN\nCONCLUSION\nThe local oral histories and chiefship disputes discussed in this article\nhave been revealing of much wider issues than their immediate\nspecificities. They demonstrate the continuities in the experience of\n\u2018government\u2019 over the last century, which to some extent expose the\nlimits of the de-normalization wrought by lengthy periods of civil war.\nGuerrilla wars, especially in the 1990s, have been seen to involve\nunprecedented trauma and violence. But the origins of chiefship in this\npart of Central Equatoria, and local understandings of its role, have\nensured that the institution of chiefship has been uniquely well suited to\nmanaging the relations between military\/governments and the civilian\npopulation during the war. The chiefs are indeed linked intrinsically to\ngovernment violence, but as mediators and shields, not as Mamdani\u2019s\nstrong arm of the state. Whether the chiefs will be as suited to a role\nin a \u2018post-conflict\u2019 scenario remains to be seen. Chiefs have retained\nlegitimacy in this area (and often more generally in Southern Sudan) for\nso long partly because of their marginal status and the limited potential\nfor the development of profitable patrimonial relations between local\nand state political players (unlike, notably, in Sierra Leone). If they\nare treated as the central community authorities with sole rights over\n\u2018tradition\u2019, land rights and \u2018customary law\u2019, they may become the\nfocus for much greater factionalism and resentment; West and Kloeck-\nJenson (1999) offer a salient warning of similar misunderstandings\nand simplifications in Mozambique. But nevertheless, the historical\nexperience of government in Southern Sudan has taught that only a\nmember of the local community can be trusted to take the personal risks\nrequired to \u2018bail\u2019 his people from the recurring violence of the state.\nAnd the debates over definitions of that community generated by the\npatrilineally marginal status of some chiefs have so far served to prevent\nthe kind of exclusionary definition of chiefdoms observed elsewhere.\nPolicy makers, who envision a democratic and developmental state and\nseek to incorporate chiefs into it, risk ignoring the historical experiences\nof rural people, and their current expectations. The new government is\ndominated by the very officers who have inflicted violence and made\ndemands upon them, and who were tolerated on the understanding\nthat a bargain was being struck with them as it had been with other gela\nbefore them. People continue to tolerate a chief like Ezekia, however\ngrudgingly, because he has proven his ability to speak out to the gela,\nnot because they necessarily believe he is the best person to represent\nthem in a not-yet-existing democratic and distributive state.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis article draws on my PhD (funded by the AHRB) and fieldwork conducted in\n2005\u20136 for a postdoctoral oral history project funded by the Leverhulme Trust and\nthe British Institute in Eastern Africa.

It argues that these\nlocal histories reveal much about the historical relationship between state\nand society \u2013 and in particular the mediation with external violence \u2013 which is\ncentral to understanding the legitimacy of local authority. Rather than being\nthe strong arm of the state, chiefs have ideally mediated and deflected state\n(and rebel) violence. Unlike other African examples, they have been marginal\nboth in landowning and patriclan structures, so that chiefship has offered a\nmore inclusive and pragmatic definition of community than have patrilineal\ndiscourses. As elsewhere in Southern Sudan, the early chiefs were often proxy\nmediators with marginal or outside origins and their access to government\nforce has been balanced by the continuing authority of rain chiefs, elders,\nsenior lineages and \u2018maternal uncles\u2019. Current governance interventions which\ntreat chiefs as sole custodians of community land and customs may not be\n558 VIOLENCE AND CHIEFSHIP IN SUDAN\ncompatible with local understandings of the role of the chief. Oral histories of\nchiefship origins reflect a symbolic bargain made with government and with\nchiefs, whereby the latter use their \u2018good speech\u2019 to mediate violence, and if\nnecessary sacrifice themselves to \u2018bail\u2019 people from external\/government force.\nRE\u00b4SUME\u00b4\nCet article e\u00b4tudie des histoires orales et des de\u00b4bats de chefs spe\u00b4cifiques aux\nlendemains de la guerre de la SPLA au sein de deux chefferies du Sud du\nSoudan. Il soutient que ces histoires locales sont tre`s re\u00b4ve\u00b4latrices de la relation\nhistorique entre l\u2019E\u00b4tat et la socie\u00b4te\u00b4 (et notamment la me\u00b4diation de la violence\nexterne), qui est centrale pour comprendre la le\u00b4gitimite\u00b4 de l\u2019autorite\u00b4 locale.\nAu lieu d\u2019e\u02c6tre le bras fort de l\u2019E\u00b4tat, les chefs ont ide\u00b4alement joue\u00b4 le ro\u02c6le\nde me\u00b4diateurs et de\u00b4tourne\u00b4 la violence d\u2019E\u00b4tat (et des rebelles). Contrairement\na` d\u2019autres exemples africains, ils ont e\u00b4te\u00b4 marginaux en termes de structures\nde proprie\u00b4te\u00b4 foncie`re et de patriclan, de sorte que la chefferie a offert une\nde\u00b4finition plus inclusive et pragmatique de la communaute\u00b4 que ne l\u2019ont fait les\ndiscours patriline\u00b4aires. Comme ailleurs dans le Sud du Soudan, les premiers\nchefs e\u00b4taient souvent des me\u00b4diateurs indirects avec des origines marginales ou\nexte\u00b4rieures, et leur acce`s a` la force gouvernementale a e\u00b4te\u00b4 contrebalance\u00b4 par\nl\u2019autorite\u00b4 continue des chefs de pluie, des anciens, des lignages supe\u00b4rieurs et des\n\u2018\u2018oncles maternels\u2019\u2019. Les actions de gouvernance actuelles qui traitent les chefs\ncomme les gardiens exclusifs des terres et des coutumes de la communaute\u00b4\npeuvent e\u02c6tre en contradiction avec les interpre\u00b4tations locales du ro\u02c6le du chef.\nLes histoires orales des origines des chefs refle`tent un accord symbolique passe\u00b4\navec le gouvernement et avec les chefs, par lequel ces derniers utilisent leur \u2018\u2018bon\nparler\u2019\u2019 pour re\u00b4gler les proble`mes de violence par lame\u00b4diation et, si ne\u00b4cessaire, se\nsacrifient pour \u2018\u2018sauver\u2019\u2019 les personnes de la force exte\u00b4rieure\/gouvernementale.\n"}
