Introduction\n1.1 Background\nCO2 is the main greenhouse gas. CO2 emissions have an impact on global climate change. Global\nconcentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere have increased from pre-industrialisation levels of\napproximately 280 parts per million by volume (ppmv) in around 1860 to approximately 316 ppmv in 1958\nand rapidly to approximately 369 ppmv today (UNEP, 2005). Global CO2 concentration is predicted to rise\nto above 750 ppmv by 2100 if no action is taken to address the current situation.\nPower generation from fossil fuel-fired power plants (e.g. coal and natural gas) is the single largest source\nof CO2 emissions (Freund, 2003). However, fossil fuel fired power plants play a vital role in meeting energy\ndemands. For instance, coal-fired power plants could be operated flexibly in meeting with varying\ndemand. With growing concerns over the increasing atmospheric concentration of anthropogenic\ngreenhouse gases, effective CO2 emission abatement strategies such as Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)\nare required to combat this trend.\nCCS is a \u201cprocess consisting of the separation of CO2 from industrial and energy-related sources, transport\nto a storage location and long-term isolation from the atmosphere.\u201d (IPCC, 2005). From this definition,\nCCS consists of three basic stages: (a) Separation of CO2; (b) Transportation and (c) Storage. There are\n2three major approaches for CCS: Post-combustion capture, Pre-combustion capture and Oxyfuel process\n(IPCC, 2005).\nPost-combustion capture offers some advantages as existing combustion technologies can still be used\nwithout radical changes on them. This makes post-combustion capture easier to implement as a retrofit\noption to existing plants compared to the other two approaches. The advantage comes at the expense of\nthe efficiency of the power generation process. The separation stage (i.e. CO2 capture) is energy intensive\nand as such largely determines the cost of the CCS process. It represents about 75-80% of the total cost of\nCCS (Davison, 2007).\nA number of separation technologies could be employed with post-combustion capture. These include: (a)\nadsorption; (b) physical absorption; (c) chemical absorption; (d) cryogenics separation and (e) membranes\n(see, for example, IPCC, 2005). Figure 1 shows classification of various separation technologies available\nfor post combustion capture. A brief introduction of these technologies will set the background of this\nreview paper.\nFigure 1 Process technologies for post combustion CO2 capture adapted from (Rao and Rubin, 2002)\n1.1.1 Adsorption\nAdsorption is a physical process that involves the attachment of a gas or liquid to a solid surface. The\nadsorbent is regenerated by the application of heat (temperature swing adsorption, TSA) or the reduction\nof pressure (pressure swing adsorption, PSA). Adsorbents which could be applied to CO2 capture include\nactivated carbon, alumina, metallic oxides and zeolites (IEA GHG, 1993, Zhao et al, 2007).\nCurrent adsorption systems may not be suitable for application in large-scale power plant flue gas\ntreatment. At such scale, the low adsorption capacity of most available adsorbents may pose significant\nchallenges. In addition, the flue gas streams to be treated must have high CO2 concentrations because of\nthe generally low selectivity of most available adsorbents. For instance, zeolites have a stronger affinity\nfor water vapour. (IEA 2004, IEA 2007, Zhao et al, 2007)\n1.1.2 Physical absorption\nThis involves the physical absorption of CO2 into a solvent based on Henry\u2019s law. Regeneration can be\nachieved by using heat, pressure reduction or both. Absorption takes place at high CO2 partial pressures.\nAs such, the main energy requirements originate from the flue gas pressurization. Physical absorption is\ntherefore not economical for gas streams with CO2 partial pressures lower than 15vol% (Chakravati et al,\n2001, IEA, 2004). Typical solvents are Selexol (dimethyl ethers of polyethylene glycol) and Rectisol\n(methanol) (IEA GHG, 1993).\nAdsorption Cryogenics Membranes\nAdsorber Beds:\n- Alumina\n- Zeolite\n- Activated Carbon\nRegeneration Methods\n- Pressure Swing\n- Temperature Swing\n- Washing\nGas Separation\n- Polyphenylenoxide\n- Polydimethylsiloxane\nGas Absorption\n- Polypropylene\nAbsorption\nChemical\n- MEA\n- KS-1 and KS-2\n- Ammonia\n- Others\nPhysical\n- Selexol\n- Rectisol\n- Others\nMicrobial\/Alg\nal Systems\nCO2 Separation Technologies\n31.1.3 Cryogenics separation\nCryogenics separation separates CO2 from the flue gas stream by condensation. At atmospheric pressure,\nCO2 condenses at -56.6\u00b0C (IEA GHG, 1993). This physical process is suitable for treating flue gas streams\nwith high CO2 concentrations considering the costs of refrigeration. This is also used for CO2 capture for\noxyfuel process.\n1.1.4 Membrane absorption\nWhen membranes are used in gas absorption, membranes act as contacting devices between the gas\nstream and the liquid solvent. The membrane may or may not provide additional selectivity. These offer\nsome advantages over the conventional contacting devices such as packed columns as they are more\ncompact and are not susceptible to flooding, entrainment, channelling or foaming. They, however, require\nthat the pressures on the liquid and gas sides are equal to enable CO2 transport across the membrane.\nTheir separation efficiency depends on the CO2 partial pressure. As such, they are suitable for high CO2-\nconcentration applications (well above 20vol%) such as flue gas streams from oxyfuel and IGCC processes.\n(Favre 2007, IEA GHG 1993, IPCC, 2005).\n1.1.5 Membrane-based separation\nIn membrane-based separation, selectivity is provided by the membranes themselves. These usually\nconsist of thin polymeric films and separate mixtures based on the relative rates at which constituent\nspecies permeate. Permeation rates would differ based on the relative sizes of the molecules or diffusion\ncoefficients in the membrane material. The driving force for the permeation is the difference in partial\npressure of the components at either side of the membrane. However, the selectivity of this separation\nprocess is low and thus a fraction of the CO2 is captured. In addition, the purity of the captured CO2 is low\nfor the same reason (IEA, 2004, IEA GHG, 1993). Multistage separation is employed to capture a higher\nproportion of CO2 incurring extra capital and operating cost (Chakravati et al, 2001, IEA, 2004, IEA GHG,\n1993).\n1.1.6 Chemical absorption\nChemical absorption involves the reaction of CO2 with a chemical solvent to form a weakly bonded\nintermediate compound which may be regenerated with the application of heat producing the original\nsolvent and a CO2 stream (IPCC, 2005). The selectivity of this form of separation is relatively high. In\naddition, a relatively pure CO2 stream could be produced. These factors make chemical absorption well\nsuited for CO2 capture for industrial flue gases. More details will be described in Section 2.\n1.2 Aim of this paper and its novelty\nThis paper aims to provide a state-of-the-art assessment of the research work carried out so far in post-\ncombustion capture with chemical absorption. For beginners, this paper will give an introduction to the\ntechnology and a summary of literatures. For experienced researchers, this paper will review the recent\nprogress and predict the future research directions based on the available achievements.\nThe differences between this paper and previous review reports such as IPCC (2005) and Davidson (2007)\nare: (a) This paper is to provide an update of important research programs worldwide and major pilot\nplant studies; (b) This paper is to provide a critical review of research activities in modelling and\nsimulation; (c) This paper is to draw the readers\u2019 attention on process intensification for post-combustion\ncapture with chemical absorption; (d) This paper tries to predict challenges and future breakthroughs.\n1.3 Outline of the paper\nIn Section 2, the technology is introduced. Then major research programs worldwide and experimental\nstudies based on pilot plants are reviewed in Section 3. This is followed by an overview of various studies\nbased on modelling and simulation in Section 4. Section 5 is a survey of various solvents and relevant\nproblems such as degradation. Section 6 discusses new development in process intensification for post-\ncombustion CO2 capture. In Section 7, we try to predict challenges ahead and potential new\ndevelopments from different aspects such as new solvents, pilot plants, heat integration (to improve\nefficiency), modelling and simulation, and process intensification. Conclusions are drawn in the end.\n2. Post-combustion CO2 Capture with Chemical Absorption\nPost-combustion CO2 Capture means that CO2 is removed after combustion of the fossil fuel. In other\nwords, CO2 is captured from flue gases at power plants or other large point sources. The most commonly\nused solvent is monoethanolamine (MEA).\n2.1 Preparation of the flue gas to use the technology\n4Prior to absorption, other acid gases such as SO2 and NO2 must be removed as they affect the\nperformance of the system by forming heat stable salts with solvent such as MEA. SO2 concentrations of\nless than 10ppm are recommended (Davidson, 2007). SO2 removal is usually achieved in a Flue Gas\nDesulphurization (FGD) unit. NOx is removed using Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR), Selective\nNoncatalytic Reduction (SCNR) or low NOx burners. Particulate matter such as fly ash is removed by either\nelectrostatic precipitators (ESP) or bag house filters otherwise they would cause foaming in the absorber\nand regenerator columns decreasing their performance.\nThe presence of oxygen increases the likelihood of corrosion in equipment. In addition, alkanolamines like\nMEA can easily be degraded in the presence of oxygen (Davidson, 2007). Oxygen levels of less than 1ppm\nare recommended for use with MEA when corrosion inhibitors are not employed (IEA GHG, 1993). The\nFluor Daniel ECONAMINETM Process makes use of inhibitors (IPCC, 2005).\nFlue gases to the CO2 absorber must be cooled between 45\u201350\u00b0C (Rao et al. 2007, Ramezan et al. 2007).\nThis would improve absorption of CO2 and minimize solvent losses due to evaporation. This is achieved in\na direct contact cooler (DCC) where the flue gas is cooled by a spray of water, this in addition saturates\nthe flue gas to the absorber and thereby helps the water balance.\n2.2 Process description\nThe conventional MEA absorption process is displayed in Figure 2 (IPCC, 2005). The cooled flue gas is\ncontacted counter-currently with the lean solvent usually of CO2 loading of about 0.1\u20130.2 mol CO2\/mol\nMEA yielding a rich solvent of about 0.4\u20130.5 mol CO2\/mol MEA loading (Freguia and Rochelle, 2003). The\nscrubbed gas is then water washed of solvent and vented to the atmosphere. The lean solvent gradually\nheats up as it absorbs CO2. The temperature inside the absorber is typically between 40\u00b0C and 60\u00b0C. The\nrich solvent is heated in a cross heat exchanger by regenerated lean solvent from the Stripper (or\nregenerator). It is then pumped to the top of the Stripper where it is regenerated at elevated\ntemperatures (100\u00b0C-120\u00b0C) and at slightly higher than atmospheric pressure (1.5 \u2013 2 atm) (IPCC, 2005).\nHeat is supplied via the reboiler which is the major energy penalty of the process. The regenerated\nsolvent is then pumped back to the Absorber via the cross heat exchanger to reduce the temperature.\nFigure 2 Process flow diagram for CO2 capture from flue gas by chemical absorption (IPCC, 2005)\nAmine solvents like MEA degrade on contact with certain impurities such as excess oxygen, sulphur\ndioxide or nitrous oxides to form substances including heat stable salts. Part of the bottoms product from\nthe stripper is sent to a reclaimer unit where the solvent is evaporated and returned leaving the non-\nvolatile solvent wastes which are purged from the system.\n3. Important Research Programmes worldwide & Pilot Plants\nThis section seeks to give an overview of important research programs worldwide in post-combustion CO2\ncapture.\n3.1 Luminant Carbon Management program\n53.1.1 Participants and Purpose\nThe Luminant Carbon Management Program led by Professor Gary Rochelle in the Department of\nChemical Engineering, University of Texas at Austin (USA) focuses on the technical obstacles to the\ndeployment of post-combustion CO2 separation from flue gas by alkanolamine absorption\/stripping and\nintegrating the design of the capture process with aquifer storage\/enhanced oil recovery processes\n(Rochelle, 2010)\n3.1.2 Description of facilities\nThe schematic of the pilot plant facility is shown in Figure 3. Both the absorber and stripper columns are\npacked columns with internal diameters of 0.427m and total column height of 11m. Columns consist of\ntwo 3.05m packed bed sections with a collector plate and redistributor between the beds. Both random\nand structured packings were used alternatively in the two columns. The facility has a capacity to process\napproximately 3 tons of CO2 per day (Dugas, 2006). The flue gas stream is prepared since it is not obtained\ndirectly from a power plant.\n3.1.3 Activities\nAt this university pilot plant, several studies are carried out where research looks into CO2 rate kinetics\nand solubility measurements (Bishnoi and Rochelle, 2000), degradation of solvents (Chi and Rochelle\n(2002), Davis and Rochelle (2009)), systems modelling (Freguia and Rochelle (2003), Ziaii et al. 2009), pilot\nplant testing (Dugas (2006), Chen et al. (2006)) amongst others.\nOne of the main projects carried out was the Carbon Dioxide Capture by Absorption with Potassium\nCarbonate. This project ran from 2002 to 2007 with the aim to improve the process for CO2 capture by\nalkanolamine absorption\/stripping by developing an alternative solvent, aqueous Potassium Carbonate\n(K2CO3) promoted by piperazine (NETL, 2008). Accomplishments include evaluation of three solvents \u2013\nMEA, and two variants of the piperazine-promoted K2CO3. It was shown that the requirements for one of\nthe piperazine promoted K2CO3 solvents was much less than the conventional MEA due to increased\nabsorption capacity and rates, as well as reduced heat of absorption \u2013 implying reduced regeneration\nrequirements. A number of studies were also carried out on the process performance in terms of packing\nperformance and absorber\/stripper configurations among others. A rate-based model of the absorber\nunit was developed. Absorber intercooling was found to improve absorption performance especially for\nhigh absorption capacity solvents. (NETL, 2008)\nFigure 3 Schematic of CO2 capture pilot plant from (Dugas, 2006)\n3.2 International Test Centre (ITC) for CO2 capture\n3.2.1 Participants and Purpose\nThe ITC is formed by the collaboration of University of Regina (Canada) led by Professor Malcolm Wilson\n6and a consortium of government, industrial partners and its aim is to explore and develop new cost\neffective technologies for CO2 capture.\n3.2.2 Description of facilities\nInfrastructure in the ITC consists of bench-scale CO2 separation units as well as a multi-purpose pilot plant\nunit (1 ton of CO2 per day) at the University of Regina. A 250kW steam boiler is used to generate the flue\ngas which is then treated in a CO2 absorption unit. The absorption column is composed of three 0.3 m-\ndiameter sections for a total height of 10 m.\nIn 2000, the ITC re-commissioned a semi-commercial (4 ton of CO2 per day) demonstration unit adjacent\nto SaskPower\u2019s 875 MW Boundary Dam power station. The unit captures CO2 from part of the flue gas\nfrom this coal-fired power plant (Wilson et al, 2004). This facility consists of three units in series as shown\nin Figure 4:\ni. A baghouse unit for flyash removal\nii. A scrubbing unit for removal of SO2 down to 2ppm.\niii. Chemical absorption-based CO2 recovery unit (Fluor\u2019s Econamine FG\nSM technology).\nFigure 4 Schematic of Boundary Dam CO2 Pilot Plant (Wilson et al, 2004)\n3.2.3 Activities\nKinetics of the reactive absorption of carbon dioxide in high CO2-loaded, concentrated aqueous MEA\nsolutions were studied in Aboudheir, et al. (2003) by experiments. Kinetics of the reactive absorption of\ncarbon dioxide with mixed solvents MEA and MDEA were again studied in Edali et al. (2009). Pilot plant\nstudies of the CO2 capture performance of aqueous MEA and mixed MEA\/MDEA solvents at the University\nof Regina CO2 capture technology development plant and the Boundary Dam CO2 capture demonstration\nplant were compared in Idem et al. (2006). Uyanga and Idem (2007) studied the degradation of solvent\nMEA in the presence of SO2. Kittel et al. (2009) studied corrosion of MEA unit for CO2 capture through\npilot plant experiment.\n3.3 CASTOR\n3.3.1 Participants and Purpose\nThis European Commission-funded and IFP-run project involves capturing and providing geological\nstorage for 30% of the emissions released by large industrial facilities around Europe (conventional power\nstations, principally), i.e. for 10% of Europe\u2019s CO2 emissions. CASTOR, which started in February 2004, was\n7a 4-year program and counts members from 11 EU countries, including: (a) 16 industrial firms (Dong\nEnergy, Vattenfall, Repsol, Statoil, Gaz de France, Rohoel, Alstom power, RWE, etc); (b) 12 research\ninstitutes (IFP, BGRM, Imperial College, TNO, BGS, IFP, etc.). The CASTOR project had a total budget \u20ac15.8\nmillion with a contribution of \u20ac8.5 million from European Commission (FP6 \u2013 sixth framework program)\n(IEAGHG, 2010).\nIts specific goals involve halving the cost of capturing (from \u20ac40-60\/ton CO2 to \u20ac20-30\/ton CO2) and\nseparating CO2, developing the geological-storage concept\u2019s efficiency, safety and security while limiting\nits environmental impact, and testing it in real-life, industrial-scale facilities.\n3.3.2 Description of facilities\nFigure 5 Simplified flow diagram of the CASTOR pilot plant at Esbjergv\u00e6rket (Knudsen et al, 2009)\nA gas-fired mini plant with full absorption\/desorption cycle was built at the University of Stuttgart. This\nfacility consists of an absorber with 0.125m diameter absorber and 4m height and a 2.5m high stripper.\nAn industrial-scale pilot plant facility (Figure 5) was launched alongside a power plant run by Dong Energy\n(formerly ELSAM) in Esbjerg, Denmark on 15 Mar. 2006. This plant has a capacity to capture about\n24tonnes of CO2 per day.\n3.3.3 Activities\nStudies were carried out on the selection of solvents as well as solvent degradation for the larger CASTOR\npilot plant (Notz et al, 2007). Since Mar. 2006, four 1000-hour test campaigns have been carried out with\nMEA solvent and new proprietary solvents \u2013 CASTOR-1 and CASTOR-2. In January to February 2006, a\n1000-hour preliminary test campaign was conducted using 30wt% MEA being the reference solvent.\nAnother 1000-hour test was repeated from mid December 2006 to February 2007 to improve on certain\nproblems encountered in the first test whilst collecting data (Knudsen et al, 2009). Results show that it is\npossible to run the post combustion plant continuously whilst achieving roughly 90% CO2 capture levels.\nIn addition, one of the proprietary solvents, CASTOR-2, operated with lower steam requirement and L\/G\nratio than the conventional MEA solvent.\nFrom CASTOR project, it was concluded that future investigations would involve tests of solvents\ndeveloped in the EU CESAR project. In addition, the effect of process modifications on steam\nrequirements as well as environmental effects would be investigated (Knudsen et al, 2009).\n3.4 iCap\n8iCap is a 4-year project supported by the European Commission under the 7th Framework Program. It\nconsists of a consortium of 15 partners including eight Research & Technical Development providers and\nsix power companies as well as an Australian research institute and a Chinese university. The project\nstarted on January 1, 2010.\niCap aims to remove barriers that cause bottlenecks in post-combustion and pre-combustion CO2 capture.\nTargets include halving the efficiency penalty of CO2 capture for power plants and reducing the associated\nCO2 avoidance cost to 15\u20ac\/tonne CO2. These aims should accelerate the commercial development of large\nscale near zero emission power generation technology based on CCS (iCap, 2010).\n3.5 CAPRICE\nCAPRICE is funded by the European Union and was scheduled to last two years. This project began on 1\nJanuary 2007. TNO, a Dutch organization, is running it. CAPRICE stands for CO2 capture using Amine\nProcess International Cooperation and Exchange and involves pooling information and research findings\non amine-enabled CO2 capture with non-European CSLF countries.\nMore specifically, findings from the European CASTOR project\u2019s MEA chapter will be compared with those\nof the ITC at the University of Regina (Canada). It counts: (a) 10 research centres (University of Regina,\nAlberta Research Council, ITC, Energy Inet, IFP, Trondheim University, Stuttgart University, Tsinghua\nUniversity, Topchiev Institute of Petrochemical Synthesis, and Salvador University); (b) 3 power\ngeneration companies (E-ON, Dong Energy and Vattenfall) (CAPRICE, 2010).\n3.6 CESAR\n3.6.1 Participants and Purpose\nThis 4-year long FP7 (Seventh Framework Programme)-funded project was launched in 2008 and aims for\na breakthrough in the development of low-cost post-combustion CO2 capture technology to provide\neconomically feasible solutions for both new power plants and retrofit of existing power plants which are\nresponsible for the majority of all anthropogenic CO2 emissions. CESAR focuses on post-combustion as it is\nthe only feasible technology for retrofit and current power plant technology. The primary objective is to\ndecrease the cost of capture down to 15 \u20ac\/ton CO2. The consortium consists of 3 research organizations,\n3 universities, 1 solvent supplier, 1 membrane producer (SME), 3 equipment suppliers, 2 oil and gas\ncompanies and 6 power generators (= industrial commitment) (CO2cesar, 2010) .\n3.6.2 Description of facilities\nThis project employs the Esberg pilot plant used in the CASTOR project.\n3.6.3 Activities\nNovel activities and innovations CESAR focuses at are (CO2cesar, 2010):\n\uf0b7 Novel (hybrid) solvent systems\n\uf0b7 New high flux membranes contactors\n\uf0b7 Improved modelling and integration studies on system and plant level\n\uf0b7 Testing of new solvents and plant modifications in the Esbjerg pilot plant. In the Esbjerg Pilot\nPlant novel technologies are assessed and compared with mainstream techniques to provide a\nfast track towards further scale-up and demonstration.\n3.7 The joint UK-China Near Zero Emissions Coal (NZEC) initiative\nThe project is managed by UK consultants AEA (for the Department Energy and Climate Change in the UK),\nin partnership with the Administrative Centre for China's Agenda 21 (ACCA21), and involves a consortium\nof 28 industrial and academic partners from the UK and China. Its objectives are (a) knowledge sharing\nand capacity building; (b) future technology perspectives; (c) case studies for carbon dioxide capture; (d)\ncarbon dioxide storage potential; and (5) policy assessment. The Project started in 2007 and was finished\nat the end of 2009 (NZEC, 2009).\n3.8 The Cooperative Research Centre for Greenhouse Gas Technologies (CO2CRC)\n93.8.1 Participants and Purpose\nCO2CRC comprises participants mainly from Australia and New Zealand. CO2CRC works through 3 main\nresearch programmes in CCS: Capture research, Storage research, Demonstration and pilot projects. The\nprogramme commenced in July 2003 and was expected to last 7 years. It has since been extended up till\n2015 (CO2CRC, 2009a). Capture research involves a number of post combustion capture technologies\nsuch as solvent-based systems, innovative membrane systems and pressure swing adsorption (PST)\nsystems.\n3.8.2 Description of facilities\nCO2CRC employs a 28-metre high absorber column in its International Power Capture Plant built at the\nHazelwood coal-fired power station. The plant can capture up to 50 tonnes of CO2 per day and is the\nlargest post-combustion capture plant at a power plant in Australia (CO2CRC, 2009a).\n3.8.3 Activities\nThe Latrobe Valley (post-combustion capture) project involving CO2CRC, Loy Yang Power, International\nPower and Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) consists of a\n$5.6 million PCC research project with the aim of reducing CO2 emissions from brown coal power stations.\nResearch on three post combustion capture technologies \u2013 solvents, membranes and adsorbents is being\ncarried out.\nThe CO2CRC H3 Capture Project, based at Hazelwood power station, utilises the International Power\nCapture Plant. At present, new solvents (such as BASF PuraTreatTM) (CO2CRC, 2009b) are being\nresearched with studies conducted at industrial scale. These studies generally relate to investigating\nprocess and energy efficiency improvements. The International Power Capture plant is used for these\nstudies and can capture up to 50 tonnes of CO2 per day. (CO2CRC, 2009a)\n3.9 Investigations at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Hiroshima R&D Centre Japan\n3.9.1 Participants and Purpose\nThe Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) in conjunction with the Kansai Electric Power Company (KEPCO)\nhas conducted research and development of capturing CO2 since 1990 (Kishimoto et al, 2009). They have\ndeveloped a sterically hindered amine KS-1 solvent which has been shown to have less heat requirements\nthan the conventional MEA solvent as well as reduced solvent degradation. This solvent is used in their\nproprietary KM-CDR process (Kishimoto et al, 2009). MHI has deployed four commercial CO2 recovery\nplants which recover CO2 from natural gas fired flue gas. Tests have been carried out on a 1 tonne\nCO2\/day as well and recently on a 10 tonne CO2\/day pilot plant to demonstrate that the process is\napplicable to coal-fired power plants as well (Davidson, 2007, Kishimoto et al, 2009).\n3.9.2 Description of facilities\nMHI has successfully deployed four commercial CO2 capture plants, currently operating in Malaysia, Japan\nand two locations in India. The latter two plants have the highest capacity of 450 tonnes CO2\/day. These\nplants operate in the chemical and fertilizer industries which recover CO2 from natural gas fired flue gas\n(Kishimoto et al, 2009).\nA 1 ton CO2\/day pilot plant has been constructed in the MHI Hiroshima R&D centre to demonstrate CO2\ncapture from coal-fired flue gas and to carry out various tests for the treatment of impurities (Davidson,\n2007).\nIn Japan, a testing plant capable of recovering 10 tons of CO2 per day using MHI's KM-CDR process was\nreported to have operated at a coal-fired power generation plant in Nagasaki \u2013 the Matsushima Thermal\nPower Station of Electric Power Development Co., Ltd. (J-POWER) for over 4000 hours (Kishimoto et al,\n2009).\n3.9.3 Activities\nCurrently, MHI is working to resolve certain key issues it has identified with the deployment of post\ncombustion CO2 capture (Kishimoto et al, 2009):\n1. Reduction in energy consumption of such plants\n2. Efficient integration with other environmental control systems\n3. Minimizing the decrease in net electrical output of the power plant\n10\n3.10 Summary\nAlthough many research programs or investigations have been carried out globally, all the pilot plants for\npost-combustion CO2 capture with MEA are small scale (for power plants up to 2.0 MWe). Consequently,\nthe packed column sizes are modest in size (up to 1.1 m in diameter) (Feron et al., 2007, Dugas, 2006).\nTherefore, post-combustion CO2 capture with chemical absorption (although viewed as best technology\navailable) has still not been fully demonstrated.\n4. Modelling, Simulation and relevant studies\n4.1 Level of complexity in modelling\nIn modelling absorbers and stripper, two approaches are commonly used: the equilibrium-based approach\nand the rate-based approach. The former approach assumes a theoretical stage in which liquid and gas\nphases attain equilibrium and the performance of each stage is adjusted using a tray efficiency correction\nfactor (Schneider et al., 1999). This is usually sufficient to model non-reactive systems. In amine\nabsorption, chemical reactions are involved and such equilibrium is rarely attained. As such, the rate-based\napproach is more appropriate. In the rate-based approach, actual rates of multi-component mass and heat\ntransfer as well as chemical reactions are considered directly (Noeres, 2003).\nTo model such a reactive absorption process, simple or complex representations can be used for mass\ntransfer and reaction aspects. Differences between various forms of models are indicated in Figure 6 (Kenig\net al., 2001).\nFigure 6 Different levels of reactive absorption model complexity (Kenig et al., 2001)\nStarting from Model 1 in Figure 6, the packed column is modelled as a distillation column containing\ndifferent equilibrium stages. Moving rightwards (Model 2), the model accuracy is increased by considering\nthe bulk phase reaction kinetics. Moving upwards (Models 3, 4 and 5), the mass transfer rate is\nconsidered. Thus, the models are called rate-based models. The mass transfer across the gas-liquid interface\ncan be described using the two-film theory. At its lowest level of complexity (Model 3 in Figure 6), the\nchemical reactions of the rate-based model are assumed to be at equilibrium. Model 3 can be accurate only\nwhen the reaction rate between CO2 and the solvent is very fast. In Model 4, an enhancement factor is used\nto estimate actual absorption rates. However, the enhancement factor used is strictly valid for the pseudo\nfirst-order reaction regime (Kucka et al., 2003). Chemical reactions are assumed to be completed in the\nliquid film while the bulk fluid remains in chemical equilibrium. Model 5, the most complex of all,\nconsiders mass transfer resistances, electrolyte thermodynamics, the reaction system as well as the column\nconfigurations. With Model 5, the acceleration of mass transfer due to reactions in the liquid film is taken\ninto account (Kucka et al., 2003). Therefore, Model 5 is the most accurate and will give more realistic\npredictions.\n4.2 Basic Theory behind modelling - Two-film theory and Penetration theory\nTo describe such a process accurately, it is necessary to develop mathematical models taking into account\nthe column hydraulics, mass transfer resistances and reactions.

Heat\nand mass transfer resistances are assumed to be restricted to these laminar film regions (Danckwerts, 1970).\nThe penetration theory originally proposed by Higbie assumes that every element on the surface of the\nliquid is exposed to the vapour phase for the same length of time, before it is replaced by liquid of the bulk\ncomposition. The exposure time encompasses the effects of the hydrodynamic properties of the system and\nis used to define their effect on the mass transfer coefficient (Danckwerts, 1970).\n4.3 Current status of modelling Post-combustion with CO2 capture\nThe performances of the Absorber and the Stripper, the two major components in the conventional CO2\ncapture process, have been studied by a number of researchers through modelling and simulation.\nIn Lawal et al. (2009a), a dynamic rigorous model was developed for the Absorber. This assumed rate-\nbased mass transfer with reactions at equilibrium (Model 3). Process analysis based on this model found\nthat the Absorber performance can be maintained during part load operation by maintaining the ratio of the\nflowrates of the lean solvent and flue gas to the Absorber. In Kvamsdal et al. (2009), the Absorber was\nmodelled dynamically assuming rate-based mass transfer and counting the impact of reaction with an\nenhancement factor (Model 4 in Figure 6). The dynamic model of Absorber was then used to investigate\ntwo transient operation scenarios: start-up and load-reduction. The authors also pointed out that a dynamic\nmodel for the whole CO2 capture process (i.e. with the stripper and heat exchange units) is required to\nevaluate different operational challenges.\nIn Lawal et al. (2009b), a dynamic model for the Stripper was developed. This assumed rate-based mass\ntransfer and reaction at equilibrium (Model 3). It was used to analyse the impact of the reboiler duty on the\nCO2 loadings in the solvent at the bottom of the Stripper. In Ziaii et al. (2009), only the Stripper was\nmodelled dynamically using rate-based mass transfer and assuming reaction at equilibrium (Model 3 in\nFigure 6). This model was subsequently used to minimise the energy consumption of the Stripper.\nThe limitation of the publications so far (Lawal et al. (2009a), Kvamsdal et al. (2009), Ziaii et al. (2009)\nand Lawal et al. (2009b)) is that process dynamic analysis was carried out with individual dynamic models\nfor Absorber or Stripper independently without considering their possible interaction when operation\ntogether as a plant.\nIn Lawal et al. (2010), dynamic models for the absorber and regenerator columns were developed (Model 3\nin Figure 6). The gPROMS (Process Systems Enterprise Ltd.) advanced process modelling environment\nwas used. These models were then linked together with recycle (including heat exchanger). A study of the\ndynamic responses of a post-combustion CO2 capture plant was carried out based on modelling and\nsimulation. The study gives insights into the operation of the absorber-regenerator combination with\npossible disturbances arising from integrated operation with a power generation plant. The importance of\nappropriate water balance in the absorber column is shown.\n12\nAll the above models were developed based on the two-film theory (for mass transfer calculations).\nTobiesen et al. (2010) developed a rigorous absorber model based on penetration theory (for mass transfer\ncalculation). Experimental data from a laboratory pilot plant absorber were used for model validation. The\nmodel is fairly accurate.\nIn summary, an accurate dynamic model of the whole CO2 capture process is required to study the start-up,\nshutdown and operation under different power plant loads and process disturbances.\n4.4 Studies based on modelling and simulation\nBased on modelling (the two-film theory) and simulation, Aroonwilas and Veawab (2007) studied the\nperformance of different amines such as MEA, MDEA and mixture of MEA\/MDEA for CO2 capture in a 500\nMW supercritical coal-fired power plants. It was found that when the MEA and MDEA are blended at the\nappropriate ratio and used as solvent for CO2 capture, the energy consumption for regenerating CO2 is\nreduced significantly. Compared with MEA only, the whole power plant with CO2 capture can improve\nthermal efficiency around 3%. However, this study was carried out at steady state and when power plant\nis operated at full load.\nChalmers and Gibbins (2007) studied post-combustion CO2 capture with MEA for pulverised coal power\nplant under part load operating conditions. This study was again carried out at steady state based on\nsimplified models. It pointed out that further work is required to better understand transient behaviour of\npower plants with CO2 capture especially from one load changing to another.\nKvamsdal et al. (2010) studied a 450 MWe natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) sea floating power plant\n(for offshore use) with post-combustion CO2 capture with MEA. It is concluded that the NGCC plant will\nhave 9% efficiency penalty due to adding CCS with 90% CO2 captured and compression of CO2 to 1.47\nMPa. Another key issue of water balance for the whole CO2 capture process was solved by adjusting\noperating or design conditions.\n4.5 Commercial products and studies based on commercial products\nAspen Plus\u00ae provides two rigorous multistage separation models for modelling absorber and regenerator\n(or stripper). These are RadFrac and RateFrac sub-models (Aspentech, 2008). RadFrac model is\nequilibrium stage column model (equivalent as Model 2 in Figure 6). RateFrac model considers actual\nmulti-component heat and mass transfer (equivalent as Model 3 or Model 5 in Figure 6 depending upon\nwhether reaction kinetics is used).\nFreguia and Rochelle (2003) used RateFrac to simulate the absorber and stripper. These were linked with\nheat exchanger to form a whole CO2 capture process. In the absorber, the reactions involving CO2 were\ndescribed with kinetics. In the stripper model, all the reactions were set to equilibrium due to higher\noperating temperature. Effects of process design and operating variables (such as solvent circulating rate,\nabsorber height, stripper height and stripper pressure) on energy requirement were studied. Intercooling\nin the absorber was also explored and found that the reboiler duty was reduced by 3.8% for inlet stream\nwith 10 vol% CO2.\nKvamsdal and Rochelle (2008) used Aspen RateSepTM in Aspen Plus\u00ae process simulator (a second\ngeneration rate-based multistage separation unit operation) and a dynamic rate-based gPROMS model\n(Model 4 in Figure 6) to study the position of temperature bulge (which is caused by combing chemical\nabsorption and water vaporisation) in the absorber and its impact on absorption of CO2.\nZhang et al. (2009) used Aspen RateSepTM in Aspen Plus\u00ae again for simulation study. Experimental data\nfrom the pilot plant tests in the University of Texas at Austin were used for model validation of the\nabsorber only (Dugas, 2006). These experimental data include 48 runs at 24 operating conditions since\ntwo runs were executed at each operating condition. It also discussed the importance of film\ndiscretisation.\nDugas et al. (2009) used Aspen RateSepTM in Aspen Plus\u00ae to simulate the absorber. Experimental data\nfrom pilot plant tests in CASTOR project were used for model validation. It claimed that the model\nsuccessfully represented both gas phase temperature and CO2 profiles in the absorber.\n5. Solvents\nThe ideal chemical solvent possesses (Davidson, 2007):\n\uf0b7 High reactivity with respect to CO2 \u2013 which would reduce height requirements for the absorber\nand\/or reduce solvent circulation flow rates.\n\uf0b7 Low regeneration cost requirements \u2013based on a low heat of reaction with CO2\n13\n\uf0b7 High absorption capacity \u2013 which directly influences solvent circulation flow rate requirements.\n\uf0b7 High thermal stability and reduced solvent degradation \u2013 reduced solvent waste due to thermal\nand chemical degradation\n\uf0b7 Low environmental impact\n\uf0b7 Low solvent costs \u2013 should be easy and cheap to produce\n5.1 Amine-based solvents\nAmines have been used for around 75 years for the treatment of industrial gas streams with the\nalkanolamines being the most popular group of solvents (Booth, 2005). Amines could be classified as\nprimary, secondary or tertiary based on the degree of substitution of the nitrogen atom. MEA consists of\none alkanol chain and two hydrogen atoms bonded to a nitrogen atom and thus it is classified as a\nprimary amine with the molecular formula (C2H4OH)NH2. Diethanolamine (DEA) consists of two alkanol\nchains and one hydrogen atom bonded to the nitrogen atom and is a secondary amine with the molecular\nformula (C2H4OH)2NH. In the same way, triethanolamine (TEA) is a tertiary amine (C2H4OH)3N (Booth,\n2005).\nA variety of ethanolamine derivatives can be produced by replacing one or more of the ethanol groups by\nother hydrocarbon groups. An example of this is the tertiary amine methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) where\na methyl group replaces one of the ethanol groups. MDEA has the molecular formula C2H4OH)2N(CH3)\n(Booth, 2005).\nPrimary and secondary alkanolamines react rapidly with CO2 to form carbamates. Tertiary alkanolamines\ndo not possess a hydrogen atom attached to the nitrogen atom. They therefore facilitate the CO2\nhydrolysis reaction to form bicarbonates. The heat of reaction involved with bicarbonate formation is\nlower than that of carbamate formation and thus tertiary amines like MDEA are often blended with\nprimary or secondary amines to reduce solvent regeneration costs (Vaidya and Kenig, 2007).\nSterically hindered amines are primary and secondary amines modified to reduce regeneration costs.\nExamples include 2-Amino-2-methyl-1-propanol and 2-piperidineethanol (Vaidya and Kenig, 2007).\nMEA and popular alternative solvents for chemical absorption are discussed.\n5.2 MEA\nChemical absorption of CO2 is preferred for post combustion capture of CO2 from pulverized fuel power\nplants because it is able to capture CO2 in low partial pressures. MEA solvent is relatively cheap and\nchemical absorption process with MEA is backed up by commercially available and proven technology\n(Rao et al., 2004).\nDavidson (2007) highlighted some problems encountered using MEA such as (a) degradation of solvents in\nthe oxidising environment of flue gas; (b) energy consumption for regeneration of solvents; (c) corrosion.\nAlternative solvents to MEA should have higher capacity for CO2 capture and lower energy consumption.\n5.2.1 Reaction kinetics of the reactive absorption of CO2\nVaidya and Kenig (2007) reviewed the reaction kinetics of CO2 absorption in alkanolamines. In the paper it\nwas shown that there have been varied predictions of the reaction rate coefficients for absorption with\nMEA. Aboudheir et al. (2003) explained that these discrepancies are due to (among other factors) the\nassumption of a pseudo-first order reaction with respect to both CO2 and MEA. More detailed reaction\nmechanisms are needed to accurately describe the kinetics. Three mechanisms were described in Vaidya\nand Kenig (2007):\n\uf0b7 Zwitterion mechanism\n\uf0b7 Termolecular mechanism\n\uf0b7 Base-Catalyzed Hydration Mechanism\n5.2.2 Degradation of MEA solvent\nDavidson (2007) discussed three main degradation routes: (a) carbamate polymerisation; (b) oxidative\ndegradation; (c) thermal degradation.\nCarbamate polymerisation is insignificant at temperatures below 100 \u00b0C. Thermal degradation takes place\nat temperatures above 205 \u00b0C. Most degradation comes from the presence of oxygen in the flue gas.\nDavidson (2007) explains that four carboxylic acids (formate, glycolate, oxalate and acetate) are major\namine degradation products while nitrites, nitrates and ethylenediamine were also found in significant\nquantities.\n14\nSexton and Rochelle (2009) described catalysts and inhibitors for MEA oxidation. They carried out studies\nat 55\u00b0C and found that dissolved metals catalyze the oxidation process in the order copper >\nchromium\/nickel > iron > vanadium. They also identified effective degradation inhibitors such as\nethylenediaminetetracetic acid (EDTA) and explained that some expected inhibitors such as\nformaldehyde, formate and sodium sulphite actually increased MEA losses.\nDavis and Rochelle (2009) focused on the regeneration in the stripper unit. At 135\u00b0C the degradation rate\nis 2.5 to 6% per week. CO2 loading of the solvent was found to have a first order effect and amine\nconcentration had a slightly higher than first order effect on increasing the degradation rate. The paper also\nsuggests that MEA degradation is significantly reduced if temperatures are kept below 110\u00b0C.\n5.2.3 Effects of Sulphur Dioxide (SO2)\nSO2 reacts with MEA to form heat stable salts. By varying the SO2 concentrations in the range of 6 -\n196ppm, Uyanga and Idem (2007) demonstrated that an increase in SO2 concentration would result in an\nincrease in MEA degradation. Their study also suggests that an increase in CO2 loading in the liquid phase\nproduced an inhibition effect to MEA degradation because this would reduce the amount of SO2 and O2\nthat could react with the MEA solution to induce degradation. It may therefore be of advantage to\noperate the absorption process with higher lean CO2 loading. However, in doing so, consideration has to\nbe made regarding the corrosive effect of more CO2 in the system (Davidson, 2007).\n5.2.4 Corrosion of MEA solvent\nDavidson (2007) explained that factors that influenced corrosion rates in amine plants include CO2\nloading, amine type and concentration, temperature, solution velocity and degradation products. MEA is\nquite corrosive compared to the secondary or tertiary amines used for gas treating. (Kittel et al, 2009).\nCorrosion is found to reduce in the following order MEA>AMP>DEA>MDEA (Davidson, 2007).\n5.3 MEA and MDEA Blends\nOther solvents used for CO2 chemical absorption include methyldiethanolamine (MDEA). MEA can react\nmore quickly with CO2 than MDEA can, but MDEA has a higher CO2 absorption capacity and requires lower\nenergy to regenerate CO2 (Davidson, 2007, Aroonwilas and Veawab, 2007).\nAroonwilas and Veawab (2007) studied the performance of different amines such as MEA and MDEA for\ncoal-fired power plants. It was found that when the MEA and MDEA is mixed at the appropriate ratio and\nused as solvent for CO2 capture, the energy consumption for regenerating CO2 is reduced significantly.\nCompared with MEA only, the whole power plant with CO2 capture can improve thermal efficiency\naround 3%. However, this study was carried out at steady state and when power plant is operated at full\nload.\nOther solvents include the sterically-hindered amines (KS-1, KS-2 and KS-3) developed by the Kansai\nElectric Power Co. (Davidson, 2007). These solvents are claimed to offer lower energy consumption and\nsolvent loss. These solvents however, have higher costs (Reddy et al., 2003).\n5.4 Ammonia\nAmmonia has been identified as a possible alternative to MEA solvent as it has a number of desirable\ncharacteristics. It is a relatively cheap solvent that is commercially available. It has a relatively high CO2\nabsorption capacity compared to most other solvents based (among other factors) on its low molecular\nweight. It absorbs CO2 with a low heat of reaction and thus the regeneration energy requirements are also\nlow. It is not as corrosive as MEA and has a lower susceptibility to degradation in the presence of oxygen\nand other contaminants when compared with MEA (Davidson (2007), Darde et al. (2010), Kozak et al.\n(2009).\nThe Chilled Ammonia Process (CAP) is being developed for CO2 capture. In this process, CO2 is absorbed in\nthe absorber at low temperatures. This would minimize solvent losses due to its relatively volatile\ncompared with the amine solvents. First the flue gas is cooled to 0 to 20\u00b0C (preferably 0 \u2013 10\u00b0C) it is then\ncontacted in the absorber with lean solvent typically composed of 28wt% ammonia, CO2 loading between\n0.25 and 0.67mol CO2\/mol ammonia and water (Darde et al, 2010). The CO2 loading in the lean solvent\nshould be high enough to prevent excessive solvent evaporation and low enough to maximize the capture\nefficiency of the plant (Darde et al, 2010). The CO2 rich stream is typically a slurry as solid products\n(typically of ammonium bicarbonate) are formed. (Darde et al, 2010)\nThe stripper operating temperature ranges from 50 to 200\u00b0C (preferably 100 to 150\u00b0C) and the operating\npressure from 2-136atm..This produces a high pressure stream rich in CO2. Water vapour and ammonia\n15\ncould be recovered by cold washing possibly with a weak acid for higher efficiency. Energy requirements\nfor regeneration are significantly lower than those for MEA absorption.\nThe Aqua Ammonia Process is another process that employs ammonia solvent and is proposed to capture\nSO2, NOx and CO2 from the flue gas (Davidson, 2007).\n5.5 Piperazine promoted K2CO3\nThe promotion of potassium carbonate (K2CO3) with amines appears to be a particularly effective way to\nimprove overall solvent performance. K2CO3 in solution with catalytic amounts of piperazine (PZ) has been\nshown to exhibit a fast absorption rate comparable to 30% wt% MEA. Heat of absorption is significantly\nlower than that for aqueous amine systems (Cullinane and Rochelle, 2005). This could translate to 29-\n33% regeneration energy savings for certain conditions when compared with MEA (Davidson, 2007).\n5.6 Concentrated aqueous piperazine\nConcentrated, aqueous piperazine (PZ) has been investigated as a novel amine solvent for CO2 chemical\nabsorption. The CO2 absorption rate of aqueous PZ is much faster than MEA. Thermal degradation is\nnegligible in concentrated aqueous PZ up to a temperature of 150 \u00b0C. This is a significant advantage over\nMEA systems. Industrial study showed that PZ will use 10 to 20% less energy than MEA (Freeman et al.,\n2010).\n6. Process intensification (PI)\n6.1 Motivations for using process intensification in post-combustion chemical absorption\nIt should be recognised that the flue gas volumetric flowrate involved for a typical coal-fired power plant is\nextremely large. For example, an electrical output of 500 MWe corresponds to a combustion rate of\nroughly 1500 MWh. Assuming that coal\u2019s calorific value is based on the heat of formation of CO2 and\nwith 10% excess air, the flue gas flow is roughly 550m3\/s. Hence, with a flue duct velocity of 15 m\/s in\norder to limit flue pressure drops to reasonable values, the duct cross sectional area must be substantial\n(around 65m2). The CO2 chemical absorption system need only be a fairly crude affair which would\nprovide, say, the equivalent of 2 to 3 transfer units which corresponds roughly to a 10 fold CO2 reduction.\nThis is based on the assumption of a low CO2 partial pressure over the CO2 rich solvent flowing to the\nstripper system.\nWith respect to the absorption stage, as shown above, large gas ducts are needed whether or not carbon\ncapture is involved. It is, therefore, worth considering the installation of a simple liquid spray system to\nimplement the absorption stage. This leaves us with the issue of the stripping duty and the lean\/rich solvent\ncross heat exchanger where PI may be employed to good effect.\n6.2 Principles and benefits\nProcess intensification can be achieved with a novel technology called Higee (an abbreviation for high\ngravity). This was first proposed by Ramshaw and Mallinson (1981) when they invented a rotating packed\nbed (RPB) to enhance distillation and absorption efficiencies. It takes advantage of centrifugal fields\nthrough RPB to generate high gravity, and therefore boosts the mass transfer coefficients, resulting in an\norder of magnitude reduction in equipment size.\nPI is a strategy of making major (i.e. orders of magnitude) reductions in the volume of processing plant\nwithout compromising its production rate. This is achieved by reducing individual process elements and,\nwhere possible, combining process functions in multi-functional modules. In order to achieve this, new\ntechnology is exploited, often where high centrifugal acceleration fields and fine channels are used to\nintensify heat and mass transfer rates as described below.\nThe benefits of this approach are potentially profound:\n1. Piping and structural support costs can be dramatically reduced, leading to lower installation\nfactors and reduced capital costs.\n2. Process inventories are slashed, giving improved intrinsic safety when toxic or flammable\nmaterial is being treated.\n3. Residence times are reduced to seconds rather than the hours encountered in conventional\nplant. As a consequence, plant response times are much faster. This can be particularly\nimportant for reactors because it facilitates rapid grade changes and just-in-time production.\nThis may allow cost savings to be realised by reducing warehouse inventories of a multi-\ngrade product.\n16\n4. The improvement in heat\/mass transfer coefficients may be used to reduce\nthermodynamically parasitic differences in temperature\/concentration so that the process\nthermodynamic efficiency is improved.\n5. In some situations, a much smaller plant may be more compatible with the environment.\nApproximately two thirds of process unit operations involve the contact of two or more phases. Thus we\nhave boilers, condensers, absorbers and distillation columns etc. For these unit operations, the fluid\ndynamic intensity is controlled by the interfacial slip velocity which is dependent on the buoyancy force\n\u0394\u03c1.g where \u0394\u03c1 is the interfacial density difference and g is the applied acceleration.  For a given system, \nthis implies that higher levels of acceleration can result in greater flooding rates, enhanced settling and\ngreater heat\/mass coefficients. This key idea suggests that the operation of many process units in a\ncentrifugal acceleration environment such as RPB or a spinning disc, could be a powerful means of\nrealising PI. This has indeed proved to be the case, as has been shown in many publications (Ramshaw and\nMallinson, 1981). Thus distillation or absorber heights of ~ 1.5cm (gas film controlled) and 4 to 6cm\n(liquid film controlled) can be realised in a RPB while achieving very high mass fluxes in view of the\nenhanced flooding rates. Gas-liquid reactions can be performed in seconds on spinning discs provided the\nchemical kinetics are not limiting. Stripping and evaporation can be operated in one rotating element as\nthey both benefit from the high acceleration field. This is a good example of a multi-functional application.\nThis latter example is particularly relevant to the stripper stage of a carbon capture process.\nWhen the process operation does not involve multiple phases and with relatively clean systems, it may be\npossible to exploit laminar flow in narrow (0.1 to 2 mm) channels as exemplified by the printed circuit heat\nexchanger\/reactor marketed by Heatric Ltd. Very high transfer coefficients can be achieved in view of the\nshort conduction lengths involved. As the narrow channels also permit large specific areas, the space-time\nperformance of these units is impressive.\n6.3 Recent progress\nA recent laboratory study by Lin and Liu (2007) of CO2 absorption has shown that the height of transfer\nunit (HTU) for an 8 cm diameter RPB was 1 \u2013 4 cm, at modest rotational speed of less than 1,000 rpm. The\ninlet CO2 concentration was 1% mole fraction of CO2-N2 mixture and NaOH (0.2 kmol\/m3) was the\nabsorbent. This compares with the 10-60 cm of conventional packed beds for similar ratings. In a more\nrecent study by Cheng and Tan (2009) using high voidage packed beds, similar findings were reported with\namine solutions. These studies indicate that process intensification technology has the potential to reduce\nthe size of CO2 capture plants and reduce both the capital and operating costs.\nThe standard concentration of the MEA solution used for carbon capture in conventional equipment is\n30wt%. This is largely determined by the need to limit solution viscosity and the corrosion potential with\ncarbon steel construction. However, recent work by Jassim et al. (2009) using a RPB and stronger\nsolutions, has shown that much more efficient absorption can be achieved despite the higher solution\nviscosity. This effect is probably due to the accelerated chemical kinetics associated with MEA solution\nconcentrations in the range 50-100wt%. A further advantage of this approach is that the CO2 loading\/m3 of\nsolvent solution is much higher, thereby resulting in lower liquid flows between the absorber and stripper.\nIn order to overcome corrosion problems, the rotating stripper (including reboiler) would have to be\nfabricated in stainless steel. However, this would not present too much of a cost penalty in view of the\nsmall size of the unit compared to the carbon steel conventional columns. A comparison of the size of\nrotating units with their equivalent columns is shown in Figure 8 (Trent, 2004).\n17\nFigure 8 Three very small size RPBs equivalent to one large packed column (photo courtesy of The\nDow Chemical Company)\n7. Challenges ahead and potential breakthroughs\n7.1 Solvents\nThe characteristics of an ideal solvent are presented in Section 5. In the same section, recent developments\nin new solvents are also reviewed. The most commonly used solvent MEA in post-combustion chemical\nabsorption of CO2 has the following disadvantages (Resnik et al., 2004):\n\uf0b7 Low carbon dioxide loading capacity (kg CO2 absorbed per kg solvent)\n\uf0b7 Solvent degradation due to SO2 and O2 in flue gas\n\uf0b7 High equipment corrosion rate\n\uf0b7 High energy consumption\nDevelopment of new solvents has achieved some progress such as ammonia (Darde et al., 2010), piperazine\npromoted K2CO3 (Cullinane and Rochelle, 2005), and concentrated aqueous piperazine (Freeman et al.,\n2010). Future efforts should be directed towards developing better solvents. Future progress in solvents\nshould be (a) to reduce energy consumption; (b) to avoid damage to environment and human being (when it\nis vented with treated gas); (c) solvent degradation and corrosion to the packed column acceptable. More\nimportant is to combine all these in one solvent.\n7.2 Pilot plants - the roadmap to commercial scale\nA number of pilot plant scale studies have been carried out. Although these projects have so far been\nbelow 10MWe scale, their costs usually run to millions of dollars (Herzog et al, 2009). Processing flue gas\nfrom real fossil fuelled power plants has been carried out in a number of plants by treating a slip stream\nof the flue gas produced. However, to evaluate the effect of the significant energy requirements of post\ncombustion process, demonstration projects, with scales of 100s of MWe and likely costing over a billion\ndollars, are required (Herzog et al, 2009).\n18\nThe first demonstration project may be in the UK resulting from the government\u2019s CCS competition\n(Herzog et al, 2009). The UK government CCS competition has finalised in Mar. 2010 that E.ON UK and\nScottish Power will share a \u00a390 million pot (BBC News, 2010). These two firms now compete to build the\nUK\u2019s first CCS coal-fired power plant. The undisclosed amount of money each firm won, which has been\ndrawn from the \u00a390 million pot, will support engineering and design work for the CCS projects.\n7.3 Modelling and Simulation\n7.3.1 Dynamic validation\nCurrently all the dynamic models reported were only validated at steady state (rather than dynamically).\nThis is mainly due to lack of experimental data for CO2 capture pilot plants running at transient conditions.\nThe dynamic validation is vital to gain understanding for operation and control design of such a process.\n7.3.2 Use of commercial software for simulation study\nSeveral studies were reported to study the post-combustion CO2 capture process for process design and\noperation (Freguia and Rochelle (2003), Kvamsdal and Rochelle (2008), Zhang et al. (2009), Dugas et al.\n(2009)). These studied were all conducted by experts in modelling and simulation. The challenge is how to\nmake these commercial tools easy to use by practising engineers.\n7.4 Process Intensification\nAs described in Section 6, it will be seen that PI has the potential to make large cost savings in a carbon\ncapture process. It is recommended that the development of a rotating unit which combines the function of\nstripper including reboiler is actively considered.\n7.5 To reduce energy consumption of CO2 capture\n7.5.1 By developing new solvents\nGenerally for a given solvent, it can only save less than 10% of energy consumption by optimising design\nand operating conditions (Freguia and Rochelle, 2003). However, a new solvent has a potential to save 20\nto 30% (even more) of energy consumption (Darde et al., 2010).\n7.5.2 By process heat integration\nWhen the temperature profile inside the absorber is plotted, it is easy to find a temperature bulge, which is\ncaused by combing chemical absorption and water vaporisation. The temperature bulge is not helpful for\nCO2 chemical absorption. Freguia and Rochelle (2003) indicated that when the absorber deals with 3 vol%\nCO2 in the flue gas and MEA solvent is used, the temperature bulge is not significant. On the other hand,\nwhen the absorber deals with 10 vol% CO2 in the flue gas, the temperature bulge is significant. Intercooling\nmeans to take away heat from middle of the absorber to the reboiler in stripper (which has no effect on the\nrich end of the column). For the case with 10 vol% CO2 in the flue gas, reboiler duty reduced 3.8%\n(Freguia and Rochelle, 2003). Plaza et al. (2010) carried out a similar simulation study with Piperazine-\npromoted Potassium Carbonate as solvent which is intercooling in the absorber with different\nconfigurations. It is also found that the effect of intercooling is related to the position of the temperature\nbulge.\nAnother way to reduce energy consumption of CO2 capture can be achieved by better process integration of\nCO2 capture plant with the power generation plant. Lucquiaud and Gibbins (2009) studied effective\nintegration between these two parts and pointed out that with different solvent used in CO2 capture plant,\nthere will be different requirements to steam pressure, temperature and flowrate extracted from the\ncrossover pipe between the intermediate pressure and low pressure turbines.\n7.6 Simultaneous removal of SO2 and CO2\nResnik et al. (2004) carried out an experimental study to use ammonia as solvent to capture CO2, SO2 and\nNOx simultaneously from flue gas. The benefits are: (a) A single process to capture all the acidic gases is\nexpected to reduce the total cost and complexity of emission control systems; (b) The CO2 loading capacity\nby NH3 can approach 1.20 kg CO2 \/ kg NH3, while CO2 loading capacity by MEA is only 0.4 kg CO2 \/ kg\nMEA. In other words, ammonia\u2019s CO2 loading capacity is three times that of MEA; (c) Cycling tests results\ndemonstrated that a 64% reduction in regeneration energy is possible due to higher CO2 loading capacity of\naqueous ammonia solution and lower heat of reaction.\n7.7 Policy impact\nIt is sensible to assume that the government will legislate at some point so that retrofitting combined cycle\ngas turbine (CCGT) plant with CO2 capture technologies is mandatory (The Press and Journal, 2010).\nAlthough capture efficiencies are low compared with coal fired applications, it begs the question of flue gas\nre-cycling on gas turbines to increase CO2 concentration and reduce NOx.\n19\n8. Conclusions\nPost-combustion capture with chemical absorption is probably the first technology that will be deployed. A\nstate-of-the-art assessment of the research work carried out so far in post-combustion capture with chemical\nabsorption is provided in this paper. These include important research programs globally, experimental\nstudies with pilot plants, and studies through modelling and simulation. The use of process intensification\nhas also been discussed. Based on these recent developments, we tried to predict future challenges and\npotential breakthroughs. More efforts in the future should be directed to reduce energy consumption in\npost-combustion CO2 capture with chemical absorption. Another concern is the solvent\u2019s damage to the\nenvironment when it is vented with treated gas. The impact of government policies cannot be ignored\nbefore this post-combustion CO2 capture with chemical absorption process can be commercialised.\nReferences:\nAboudheir, A., Tontiwachwuthikul, P., Chakma, A. and Idem, R.
