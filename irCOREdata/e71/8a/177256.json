We propose a framework for the design and process\nevaluation of health improvement interventions occurring in a group setting, which will assist practitioners,\nresearchers and policy makers.\nMethods: We reviewed the wider literature on health improvement interventions delivered to patient groups and\nidentified a gap in the literature for designing, evaluating and reporting these interventions. We drew on our\nexperiences conducting systematic reviews, intervention, mixed method and ethnographic studies of groups for\nbreastfeeding and weight management. A framework for health improvement group design and delivery evolved\nthrough an iterative process of primary research, reference to the literature and research team discussion.\nResults: Although there is an extensive literature on group processes in education, work, politics and psychological\ntherapies, far less is known about groups where the aim is health improvement. Theories of behaviour change\nwhich are validated for individual use are often assumed to be generalisable to group settings, without being\nrigorously tested. Health improvement or behaviour change interventions delivered in a group setting are complex\nadaptive social processes with interactions between the group leader, participants, and the wider community and\nenvironment. Ecological models of health improvement, which embrace the complex relationship between\nbehaviour, systems and the environment may be more relevant than an individual approach to behaviour change.\nConclusion: The evidence for effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of group compared with one-to-one\ninterventions for many areas of health improvement in public health and primary care is weak or unknown. Our\nproposed framework is the first step towards advocating a more systematic approach to designing, evaluating and\nreporting interventions in group settings, which is necessary to improve this currently weak evidence base. This\nframework will enable policy makers and practitioners to be better informed about what works, how it works and\nin which contexts when aiming to improve health in a group setting.\nBackground\nGroups are an alternative to individual encounters for\nhealth improvement, social support and changing beha-\nviour, for example: smoking cessation [1]; weight loss [2];\nparentcraft [3]; and self care for chronic conditions like\ndiabetes [4] and osteoarthritis [5]. Such groups are evol-\nving rapidly in response to cultural, epidemiological and\nenvironmental change, for example recent increases in\ncardiac rehabilitation groups [6], the expert patient pro-\ngramme led by trained patients with personal experience\nof a condition [7] and virtual internet self-help groups\n[8]. However the evidence for health improvement inter-\nventions delivered in group settings is dispersed through\nseveral systematic reviews of specific lifestyle behaviours,\nmost of which focus on individual behaviour change\ninterventions and theory. In our experience researching\nbreastfeeding support and weight management groups\nsince 2000 and 2002 respectively, we were surprised by\nthe lack of guidelines for designing, evaluating or report-\ning health improvement interventions in group settings.\n* Correspondence: p.hoddinott@abdn.ac.uk\n\u2020 Contributed equally\n1Health Services Research Unit, University of Aberdeen, Health Sciences\nBuilding, Foresterhill, Aberdeen AB25 2ZD, UK\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nHoddinott et al.

Groups are included in the broad\ncategory of community interventions, defined as social\nor family groups linked by networks, geographical loca-\ntion or another common factor.\nIn this paper, we use a broad definition of health\nimprovement to include health promotion, disease pre-\nvention (primary and secondary), public health, commu-\nnity development approaches and social support. We\nrefer to \u201cinterventions in group settings\u201d to define what\nhappens to people within the group, the context in\nwhich it happens and the relationship between the two.\nOur definition of the setting refers to an observable\nhealth improvement group and the related activities and\nprocesses that occur. These include the place where the\ngroup meets and we consider the wider aspects of the\nspace occupied by people and things, including the\nattached meanings and relationships [11]. It also\nincludes the wider geographical, cultural, media, political\nand organisational environment of health improvement\ngroup settings.\nOur aim is to provide a framework for the design and\nprocess evaluation of health improvement interventions\nin group settings, guided by the literature on designing\ncomplex interventions [12]. Detailed discussion of statis-\ntical aspects are not covered but are important as they\nneed to take account of interactions between both\ngroup participants and group leaders [13]. Neither are\nspecific methods of data collection for the process eva-\nluation of group interventions discussed. Instead our\nframework poses a series of questions which are impor-\ntant to consider when designing and evaluating a group\nintervention. This is central to ecological theories of\nbehaviour, as groups are complex systems with multiple\ninteracting variables, at several levels which require a\nmixed method approach [14]. We recommend using a\ntoolkit approach [15] to choosing the most appropriate\nmethods (quantitative or qualitative) to answer each\nquestion, informed by existing evidence.\nDevelopment of the framework\nThe framework has developed through our research into\nbreastfeeding support and weight management groups,\nwhich included systematic reviews, mixed method group\ninterventions and ethnographic studies [2,16]. Studies\nincluded a randomised controlled trial of a policy to\nprovide breastfeeding groups across Scotland [17] with a\nmixed method evaluation of implementation processes\n[18]; a controlled intervention study of individual and\ngroup peer support for breastfeeding [19,20] and an eth-\nnographic study of participant and provider experiences\nof weight management groups [21]. All of these studies\nconducted in-depth qualitative interviews with partici-\npants and providers and group observations.\nIn addition, our studies and this paper were informed\nby a literature review of health improvement interven-\ntions for patient groups. We searched Medline,\nCINAHL, Embase, The Cochrane Library, National\nInstitute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), Psy-\ncinfo and the International Bibliography of the Social\nSciences using group$, class$, club$, workshop$ and\nprogram$ as title words for papers published between\n1980 until 2009. This was a pragmatic search strategy to\nlimit the number of papers identified and was necessary\nbecause of the widespread use of the word \u201cgroup\u201d in\ndiffering contexts in research papers. We identified sys-\ntematic reviews in relevant areas, for example smoking\nand alcohol cessation; chronic diseases like diabetes,\ncancer support and heart disease and searched their\nreference lists. We also searched our personal reference\narchives and hand searched references in key papers.\nWe excluded educational groups for teaching students\nor staff; organisational and management literature on\nwork groups and teams, and treatment groups in mental\nhealth, where there is an extensive literature.\nThe framework evolved through an iterative process of\nmixed method data analysis, reference to the literature,\nreflection and research team discussion over a period of\n6 years. It builds on reviews of group processes [9],\nsmall group work in education and work settings [22]\nand self-help or support groups [23].\nWhat is the evidence for health improvement\ninterventions delivered in group settings?\nThe evidence for health improvement interventions in\ngroup settings is varied, reflecting their heterogeneity\nand complexity and some argue that policy for group\ninterventions to encourage self care has raced ahead of\nthe evidence [24]. Systematic reviews often focus on an\nindividual disease, the type of treatment, or behaviour\nchange theory and they often inappropriately combine\nthe results of interventions delivered individually and in\ngroup settings in a meta-analysis [13]. For example, a\nCochrane review of additional support for breastfeeding\nHoddinott et al. BMC Public Health 2010, 10:800\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/10\/800\nPage 2 of 9\ndifferentiates between whether the support is lay or pro-\nfessional, but not between interventions delivered to\nindividuals or groups [25]. In a systematic review of\nsmoking cessation groups, theories of behaviour change\nvalidated for individual delivery, for example stages of\nchange or cognitive behavioural theory, have been\nassumed to be transferable to delivery in a group setting\n[1]. This systematic review of smoking cessation inter-\nventions [1] is one of few which has specifically analysed\noutcomes for interventions in group settings and com-\npares them with self-help materials, individual counsel-\nling, nicotine replacement or no intervention. It\nconcludes that group programmes are more effective\nthan no intervention or self help interventions, but there\nis insufficient evidence to evaluate whether groups are\nmore effective than individual counselling. Another sys-\ntematic review comparing group versus individually\ndelivered interventions for weight management in adult\nobesity found that group interventions report signifi-\ncantly more weight loss at 1 year follow-up compared\nwith the same intervention individually delivered [2]. A\nsystematic review of group education programmes for\nadults with type 2 diabetes compared with routine treat-\nment, waiting list control or no intervention, found\ngroup programmes were effective at lowering glycated\nhaemoglobin, fasting blood glucose, blood pressure,\nweight and medication use [4]. For cardiac rehabilita-\ntion, interventions delivered individually at home were\nas effective as those delivered in a centre to a group [6].\nThe aims of a group intervention, the underlying\nbehavioural change theories and group processes can\ndetermine who attends and both the group and the indi-\nvidual health outcomes. A one size fits all approach sel-\ndom meets everyone\u2019s needs and it has been argued that\nfor self care in chronic disease, groups should only be\nconsidered for simple standardised messages, where\npeer support is beneficial or preferred and where a\ngroup will save money [24]. Importantly, some groups\nmay increase health inequalities by attracting more edu-\ncated and higher income participants [17,26,27]. It has\nbeen suggested that support groups are more likely to\nbe sought for diseases viewed as stigmatizing, like AIDS,\nalcoholism, breast and prostate cancer rather than less\nstigmatizing, yet important, diseases like heart disease\n[28]. There are inconsistencies in self care group defini-\ntions, for example in a survey of American self care\ngroups 60% of those identified had professional facilita-\ntors and the clinical potential for social support in com-\nbination with professional guidance compared to peer\nonly support is largely unknown [28].\nThe potential for cost savings with group compared to\nindividual health improvement interventions can appear\nattractive; however the health economic evidence is\nmixed and often weak. In a review of individual or\ngroup self care interventions, there was insufficient\nevidence to support the claim that group interventions\nare cheaper and there are often trade-offs between the\nnumbers of patients treated and the quantity of inter-\nvention each individual receives [24]. Smoking cessation\ngroups are no more cost effective than intensive indivi-\ndual counseling [1] and breastfeeding groups provided\nas part of routine care would have similar costs to indi-\nvidual health visitor home visits to group participants\n[17]. Group interventions for weight management in\nobesity are potentially more resource saving in terms of\ntotal health professional-hours involved per participant\n[2]. Few self care group interventions for arthritis have\nmeasured service use and findings are conflicting\n[29,30].\nWhy do we need a framework?\nIn the literature discussed above, it is clear that the jury\nis still out when it comes to deciding whether group or\nindividual interventions are more effective and cost-\neffective at improving health outcomes. Group processes\nand interactions have received less attention than dyadic\nor individual behaviour change mechanisms and little is\nknown about which components of groups contribute to\neffectiveness. As a result there are many unanswered\nquestions for practitioners and policy makers who aim\nto establish patient groups to improve health outcomes.\nThe NICE behaviour change guidelines recommend\nbeing as specific as possible about the content of the\nintervention, spelling out what is done, to whom and in\nwhat social and economic context [10]. A challenge with\ngroups is to unpick the extent to which outcomes are\ndetermined by leadership style, personality, participants\u2019\ncharacteristics or more complex interactions. Having a\nframework for design and process evaluation is one step\ntowards producing this evidence and we describe this\nbelow.\nThe place, setting and context of group interventions\nThe first and crucial stage in designing and evaluating a\ngroup intervention is to consider how aspects of the set-\nting will impact on all aspects of group processes, com-\nposition and outcomes (Table 1). In a trial which\nrandomised primary care organisations to deliver a pol-\nicy to provide breastfeeding support groups, the breast-\nfeeding outcomes were explained by the characteristics\nof the primary care organisation, including health\ninequalities and deprivation, the amount of organisa-\ntional change taking place and multi-disciplinary team-\nwork [18]. The breastfeeding outcomes could not be\nexplained by the amount of intervention delivered or\nthe number of people attending the groups.\nEvaluating how different environmental settings influ-\nence behaviour has been relatively neglected in research\nHoddinott et al. BMC Public Health 2010, 10:800\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/10\/800\nPage 3 of 9\ncompared to the predominant approach of measuring\nthe psychological variables of individuals receiving a\nbehaviour change intervention. Theorising interventions\nas events in complex systems is particularly relevant to\nhealth improvement groups, where the context, the\nchange in relationships and resources over time are\nimportant [31]. The importance of the behavioural set-\nting [32] or the activity setting [33] as a unit of analysis\nis a cross disciplinary feature of psychological, social and\nbiological ecology [32,34]. Behavioural or activity set-\ntings refer to time and space bounded patterns of beha-\nviour, and the concept originates from research which\ncharacterised all behaviour settings in a small American\ncommunity [32]. This demonstrated that behavioural\nsettings have effects on individuals that extend beyond\nthe specific behaviour demanded by the activity.\nIt can be helpful to consider the context in which the\ngroup intervention takes place at macro, meso and\nmicro levels, as proposed in ecological models of health\nimprovement [35]. The macro level considers how wider\npolicy, economic and socio-cultural factors interact with\nthe group, for example media scares or the cultural\nvalues of participants. The meso level includes the inter-\nrelations between the group, the setting and the sur-\nrounding environment, for example holding the group\nin an affluent or disadvantaged area can influence per-\nceptions and who attends a group [18]. Importantly, the\nimpact of parallel activity settings [33] which may target\nthe same population should be considered. For example,\nthe impact that general parent craft groups open to all\nwomen can have on participation in breastfeeding only\ngroups [18]. Similarly, consideration should be given to\nassessing the impact of activities displaced by the group\nintervention [31]. What providers and participants stop\ndoing when a health improvement group starts is likely\nto be crucial to outcomes, yet this is seldom systemati-\ncally described or evaluated. The micro level is the\ninteraction between group participants and the space\nwhere the group meets. Community settings like church\nhalls or family centres convey different meanings for\npeople compared to health settings and health service\ngroup leaders may behave differently outside health\nservice settings [18]. Group resources can vary between\npurposely designed venues with state of the art props to\n\u201cmake do\u201d multi-purpose clinically cluttered spaces.\nConsideration should also be given to sensory percep-\ntions including comfort, temperature, noise, smell and\nvisual appearance [20].\nDesigning a group intervention\nTable 2 focuses on the design of the intervention, the\ntheory underlying the choice of intervention, the target\npopulation and choosing the relevant behavioural out-\ncome to measure.\nWhat is the intervention and what quantity will be\ndelivered?\nThe interactions between group members may form the\nintervention as with peer support or self-care [7]. The\nintervention might be something which is delivered by\nthe group leader, like a particular diet or exercise pro-\ngramme and there may be a range of intended and\nactual interaction between group participants from\nminimal, mainly non-verbal communication to high\nlevel engagement. The intervention may intend to have\nan outreach beyond the group setting, for example sex\neducation delivered by peer educators [36]. It is particu-\nlarly important in trials of interventions in group set-\ntings to consider the statistical aspects of whether the\ngroup attributes and processes detailed in Tables 1, 2\nand 3 are acting as mediators or moderators between\nthe intervention and the health outcomes. The group\nsize, frequency, duration and lifetime will all influence\ngroup composition and processes. Decisions about the\ncomponents of the intervention are linked to the under-\nlying theory informing it and the outcomes of interest\nwhich are discussed below. There are detailed guidelines\nabout how to report the attributes of complex interven-\ntions which are relevant to groups [37,38]. However,\nreducing complex social processes like groups into stan-\ndardised, reproducible intervention components has its\ncritics [39] and interventions which are responsive to\nlocal contexts and change over time may be more\nappropriate.\nHow does someone become a group member?\nIt is important to assess how entry rituals and gate-\nkeeper assumptions are influencing information dissemi-\nnation and recruitment to a group. Some groups have\nelaborate entry rituals, for example general practitioners\nmay be asked to complete forms prior to registering for\na cardiac rehabilitation group whereas other groups\nencourage open access. Convenience, minimising bar-\nriers and ensuring that the participant benefits outweigh\nthe risks are crucial to a successful group and will be\nhighly context dependent [20]. In a study comparing\ncommercial and health service groups for weight loss,\nTable 1 The setting\nA) Within the meeting place and venue - the activity setting\nB) The immediate surrounding environment including parallel\nactivity settings\nC) The wider geographical area\nFor each of the above consider:\n\u25cb Socio-demographic characteristics, facilities, human and\nstructural resources (e.g. funds, time, people, physical objects)\n\u25cb Access issues\n\u25cb Sensory aspects (comfort, temperature, noise, smell, visual)\n\u25cb Meanings attributed to the setting including opportunities and\nthreats\nD) The wider policy, political, media, legal, cultural and\nenvironmental context and how it interacts with the group\nHoddinott et al.

Relationships between professional gatekeepers and\n\u201cthe group\u201d can both facilitate or hinder attendance, for\nexample infrequent midwife participation led to limited\nattendance by pregnant women in a trial of breastfeed-\ning support groups [18].\nTable 2 Designing interventions in group settings\nWhat is the intervention and what quantity will be delivered?\n\u25cb The group itself as the intervention\n\u25cb The group leader delivers the intervention\n\u25cb The group as a vehicle for delivering the intervention to a wider\npopulation\n\u25cb The group size, frequency, duration and lifetime\nHow does someone become a group member?\n\u25cb Are there gatekeepers and how do they operate\n\u25cb Self or professional referral, with or without criteria\n\u25cb Advertising: general or targeted\n\u25cb Access to attend meetings: open (anyone can drop in and out of\nattending meetings); closed (membership registration on\nattendance, in advance or for a fixed period)\n\u25cb Access during a group meeting: open (drop in and out); closed\n(fixed start and finish)\n\u25cb Barriers, facilitators and entry rituals\n\u25cb Incentives and costs (financial and non financial) - joining,\nrecurring, optional, refundable\nWhat social and behaviour theories inform the intervention?\n\u25cb Education: factual, tacit or experiential knowledge\n\u25cb Support: for a specific behaviour, attitude or belief\n\u25cb Cognitive approaches: to change thinking about a behaviour\n\u25cb Performing a behaviour or activity\n\u25cb Rewarding a behaviour or group attendance\n\u25cb Competition between groups or group members\nHow are the group influencing attitudes, beliefs and behaviours?\nFor example:\n\u25cb Social comparison theory\n\u25cb Social support theory\n\u25cb Social learning theory\n\u25cb Social impact theory\nWhat are the outcomes?\n\u25cb Initiate or sustain a desired behaviour\n\u25cb Reduce, stop or prevent a relapse of an undesirable behaviour\n\u25cb Substitute a desirable for an undesirable behaviour\n\u25cb Change how an existing behaviour is enacted\n\u25cb Change attitudes or beliefs which might predict or mediate a\nbehaviour e.g. self-efficacy\nWhat is the target population for intervention delivery and\noutcome measurement?\n\u25cb Who is targeted?

BMC Public Health 2010, 10:800\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/10\/800\nPage 5 of 9\nHow will the group influence people?\nThis is a contentious area as no single theory can cap-\nture the complexity of intra and inter group behaviour.\nIn Table 2, we suggest separating the social and beha-\nvioural theories that inform the group intervention from\nthe theory of how the group itself is likely to influence\nthe attitudes, beliefs and behaviours of participants.\nIndividual behaviour change theories and techniques\nhave been reviewed [40], but not specifically for delivery\nin group settings and it cannot be assumed that they are\ngeneralisable, as individuals can behave differently when\nin a group [9]. Group composition may have a causal\neffect on group outcomes; the group may be the social\ncontext which allows other inter-personal psychological\nphenomena to unfold or group composition may be a\nconsequence of other external factors [41].\nHow intra and inter group processes influence peo-\nple\u2019s attitudes, beliefs and behaviours are reviewed else-\nwhere [9], although not specifically in the context of\nhealth improvement. In Table 2 we provide some exam-\nples of theories which are particularly relevant to health\nimprovement group interactions. Festinger\u2019s Social\nComparison Theory [42] proposes that conformity\nwithin a group is dependent on three main motivations:\ndependence on others for information to self-evaluate;\nachieving group goals and the need for approval and a\ndesire not to seem different. Festinger hypothesises that\ngroup participants will try to improve their performance\nand will differ in whether they compare upwards or\ndownwards, for similarities or dissimilarities. They will\nselect different attributes to compare, which may not\nalways be the expected ones [20]. Downward compari-\nson where a person wants to know how dissimilar he\/\nshe is from the most undesirable person is more com-\nmon in the expert patient programme and serves to pro-\ntect a threatened self-esteem [27]. Festinger hypothesises\nthat high status members are motivated to try and\nimprove the performance of others less capable or they\nmight perform below their capability so that they would\nnot appear too different from the rest. Criticisms are\nthat social comparison theory focuses on intra-group\ncomparisons, whereas temporal comparisons with the\npast or the future, or comparisons with other groups or\nnon group participants may be of equal importance [9].\nSocial support theory proposes that information is dis-\nseminated more effectively between networks of people\nwith strong social ties and this confers health benefits\n[43]. In groups, strong and weak social connections may\ndiffer in their effects and either reinforce existing atti-\ntudes and behaviours or mediate change. Influence often\nextends beyond the group to the family, local community\nor population and this may be intentional, for example in\npeer education interventions, or unintentional. This\nposes challenges for outcome measurement and contami-\nnation, as the cumulative outcome is the sum of the indi-\nvidual outcomes and the collateral positive or negative\nhealth outcomes of others [44]. There is a continuing\ndebate about the relative importance of social support\nnetwork size and the strength of connections. On-line\nsupport groups are becoming increasingly popular and\nprovide large networks of relatively superficial support\n[28]. Further comparisons between actual and virtual\nhealth improvement and support groups are warranted.\nBandura\u2019s Social Learning Theory with its emphasis\non learning through observation and modelling beha-\nviour [45] is particularly relevant to behaviours involving\naction or performing, like breastfeeding or parenting\nskills [20]. Minorities and majorities both influence\ngroup processes and Social Impact Theory proposes a\nnegatively accelerating continuum of influence based on\nobservations that the first social stimulus has the great-\nest effect, the second less effect and the third less still\n[46].\nWhat are the health outcomes and target populations?\nOutcomes from interventions delivered in a group are\nusually measured at the individual level [1-3], and most\nstudies do not consider interactions between patients in\nthe same group which may lead to correlation of out-\ncomes [13]. Cluster randomized controlled trials where\nrandomization and outcome measurement have\noccurred at the group level are rare. Occasionally wider\npopulation level outcomes are measured, for example\nthe multifaceted STD\/HIV Intervention Project (SHIP)\nwhere peer educators delivered individual and group\ninterventions resulting in dramatic and sustained\nimprovements in sexually transmitted infections at a\npopulation level [36]. As with cluster randomized trials,\nindividuals in a group cannot be considered to be inde-\npendent of each other and variation in the outcome is\nlikely to be smaller for participants treated in the same\ngroup than for participants treated in different groups.\nSimilarly, if the same group leader delivers the interven-\ntion to different groups of participants, the outcome\nmay differ less than the outcome for participants treated\nby different group leaders. This design clustering is an\nadditional consideration when deciding whether to ran-\ndomise individuals or clusters to a group intervention.\nWhat happens within a group?\nTable 3 proposes a series of questions examining the\nmicro-level of interactions between the group leader,\nTable 3: What happens within a group (Continued)\n\u25cb How cohesive is the group?\n\u25cb How much communication between group members occurs?\nMinimal, mostly non-verbal to in depth engagement?\n\u25cb Is communication within the group channelled through the\nleader, within subgroups or free with multiple conversations?\nHoddinott et al. BMC Public Health 2010, 10:800\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/10\/800\nPage 6 of 9\nnew and existing group members and the group setting.\nIt is closely related to the ecological, social and beha-\nvioural theories described above. Group processes and\ntheir interactions with the group setting can determine\ngroup survival and the intended outcomes, but they\nhave been under-researched in the context of health\nimprovement groups and the relative importance of\nindividual components is unknown. Group Environment\nScales (GES) have been developed to systematically mea-\nsure the norms, values and psychosocial characteristics\nof social environments [47]. The underlying theory is\nthat environments like people have unique personalities,\nclimates or atmospheres which are important determi-\nnants of behaviour. GES have three basic dimensions:\nrelationship dimensions which assess the extent to\nwhich individuals are involved, for example cohesion,\nsupport; personal development dimensions, for example\nautonomy, goal attainment; system maintenance or sys-\ntem change dimensions for example order, organisation,\nclarity, control. GES have been developed in the field of\nmental health treatment, education and work and little\nis known about their generalisablity to health improve-\nment groups. They have been used to compare self-help\ngroups [23] and these three dimensions seem salient in\na wide variety of social settings, although the character-\nistics of each dimension may vary [34,48]. The dimen-\nsions we use in Table 3 are adapted from GES to\nprovide a better fit with our data. In particular the per-\nsonal development dimension seems more relevant to\neducational or treatment groups and we have reframed\nthis as attributes of the leader and the group partici-\npants. As groups are complex systems there is some\noverlap and interaction between dimensions.\nWe have used the term \u201cgroup leader\u201d to embrace a\nrange of observed styles which others have defined\n[9,22]. Variation in the delivery skills of group leaders\ncan theoretically determine the success of the interven-\ntion and it is important to consider the statistical effects\nof such clustering in the design [13]. Education, support\nand behavioural interventions in a group setting are\ncharacterised by different communication styles. For\nexample, a group leader may be an advocate of a\nmethod, philosophy, activity, seller\/deliverer of a \u201cpro-\nduct\u201d or a facilitator of person centred approaches, for\nexample empowerment, counselling or support [49].\nHow leaders with personal experience of a condition,\nfor example in commercial weight management groups\n[21] and the expert patient programme [7], influence\ngroup outcomes is largely unknown. Some groups are\nmultifaceted with communication interspersed with\nactivities like relaxation, physical activity, weighing or\nphysiological monitoring. Health service training in\ngroup leadership is variable depending on the type of\ngroup and the nature of the intervention. For example,\nexercise groups have standardised qualifications for\nleaders, whereas in some primary care groups for weight\nloss, practice nurses are self-taught and learn on the job\n[21].\nThe NICE behaviour change guidelines [10] recom-\nmend that community interventions should: improve\nself-efficacy; develop and maintain supportive social net-\nworks; promote resilience; build skills; promote partici-\npation in voluntary activities; promote involvement in\nplanning and delivery of services and have access to the\nfinancial and material resources needed to facilitate\nbehaviour change. Of fundamental importance is having\na clearly stated purpose with aims and objectives that\nare agreed by everyone. However, even with clear aims\nand objectives, differing interpretations will arise. For\nexample, in a trial of breastfeeding support groups, lea-\nders interpreted the word \u201csupport\u201d in different ways.\nDespite a clear protocol stating that support should be\nwoman-centred and based on informed choice, some\ninterpreted \u201csupport\u201d as promoting and encouraging\nexclusive breastfeeding as you might support a football\nteam [16]. Some experts classify groups into either task\norientated groups, where individuals or the group have\nspecified goals, or socio-emotional groups where feelings\nand inter-personal relationships are paramount [9].\nHowever, our group observations suggest that this bin-\nary classification may not apply to the complexity of\nhealth improvement interventions, which usually com-\nbine task and socio-emotional objectives [16,21].\nA study of cancer support groups illustrates how an\nanalysis of group processes can provide important evi-\ndence and highlights the difficulties with pre-selecting\ngroup composition [50]. Education and discussion\ngroups combining distressed and undistressed cancer\npatients were compared with a group of distressed\npatients. The heterogeneous group increased the social\ncomparison opportunities for distressed patients and\nbenefited them. However, undistressed women with\nbreast cancer who had high levels of social support\nshowed a slight deterioration in physical functioning\nwhen attending the heterogeneous group, which\nraised ethical concerns. The authors suggest training\nundistressed participants to maximise their benefit for\ndistressed participants but to minimise negative conse-\nquences for themselves.\nIndividuals tend to conform to the attitudes and beha-\nviours of the majority within a group, and cliques can\ndevelop. For example, some breastfeeding groups can be\ndominated by mothers breastfeeding older infants,\nwhich may be off-putting to new mothers joining, but\nan over-all \u201cfeel-good atmosphere\u201d can override personal\ndifferences [20]. Studies suggest that conformity and\nuniformity in groups increases with group size and over\ntime and groups tend to exhibit more extreme attitudes,\nHoddinott et al. BMC Public Health 2010, 10:800\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/10\/800\nPage 7 of 9\nbeliefs and behaviours than the individual group\nparticipants [9].\nConclusion\nThe evidence for effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of\ngroup compared with one-to-one interventions for health\nimprovement is weak or unknown. Health improvement\nor behaviour change interventions delivered in a group\nsetting are complex adaptive social processes with inter-\nactions between the group leader, participants, and the\nwider community and environment. As with any complex\nintervention, there is a need to understand which aspects\nof group processes work, for whom, how and in what cir-\ncumstances. Ecological models of behavioural change\nmay be more appropriate than applying theories of indi-\nvidual behavioural change in a group setting. This frame-\nwork is the first step towards advocating a more\nsystematic approach to designing, evaluating and report-\ning interventions in group settings, which is necessary to\nimprove the currently weak evidence base.\nAcknowledgements\nThe Chief Scientist\u2019s Office of the Scottish Government Health Directorate\nprovided funding for PH through a Primary Care Research Career Award and\nAA through a Career Scientist Award.
