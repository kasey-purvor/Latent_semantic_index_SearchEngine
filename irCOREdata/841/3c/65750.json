Harrington\nUniversity of Durham\nRecent critical observations on Akhmatova\u2019s Poema bez geroia (Poem Without a Hero) are \ndrawn together, suggesting that it detaches itself from modernism and moves beyond it in \nvarious ways. These ideas are then extended in relation to the poem\u2019s innovative stanza form. \nIt is argued that Poem represents a conscious attempt to revive the formalism and spirit of \nexperimentation that was characteristic of the Silver Age. Akhmatova both demonstrates and \ncelebrates modernist poetics, but ultimately exceeds modernism by establishing a new poetical \nsystem which regards modernism with considerable irony. The unusual stanza constitutes an \nimportant part of this dual desire both to revive, and to establish a distance from, Silver Age \nmodernism. The stanza manifests a peculiar capacity for variation and frequently departs from \nits basic structure, so that previous descriptions of Akhmatova\u2019s stanza in scholarship discern \nboth regularity and a capricious elasticity. This paradoxical combination of order with unpre-\ndictability suggests that the stanza might usefully be characterized \u2014 employing scientifi c \ndiscourse as a metaphor \u2014 as a kind of chaotic system. It furnishes Akhmatova with a \nmeans of establishing a dialogue with chaos at the level of prosody which constitutes a formal \nexpression of the theme of disintegration and chaos which is central to the poem.\nIn recent years, appeals to postmodernism have been made sporadically, but with increasing \nfrequency, by critics in relation to Poema bez geroia (Poem Without a Hero), Anna Akhmatova\u2019s \nmost obviously metafi ctional and experimental text. The arguments that have been advanced \ntend to centre on the fact that rampant and self-conscious intertextuality plays a key role \nin the poem\u2019s construction. Solomon Volkov, for instance, observes that \u2018its citations \u2014 \nobvious, hidden and encoded \u2014 from works by Petersburg authors make it the quintessential \npostmodernist text\u2019.1 In an article which draws on Mark Lipovetskii\u2019s writings, L. G. Kikhnei \nand O. R. Temirshina suggest that the poem marks the beginning of the \u2018neo-baroque\u2019 tradi-\ntion of Russian postmodernism, in that it is orientated towards the culture of the past and is \nconcerned with bringing about a \u2018revival\u2019 (vozrozhdenie) of Silver Age modernism, rather than \nevincing a break with it.2 Lipovetskii himself, along with his co-author Naum Leiderman, \ncontends that late works by Akhmatova such as Poem and Rekviem (Requiem) belong to \nthe category of \u2018postrealism\u2019, which establishes a compromise between, or fusion of, postmod-\nernism and realism.3 In short, the notion that Poem detaches itself in various ways from mod-\nernism seems slowly to be gaining critical currency.4\nPu\nbl\nish\ned\n b\ny \nM\nan\ney\n P\nub\nlis\nhi\nng\n (c\n) W\n. S\n. M\nan\ney\n &\n S\non\n Li\nmi\nted\n100 Alexandra K. Harrington\nThis article aims to draw together these disparate arguments and to extend them in relation \nto Akhmatova\u2019s unusual stanza form, the technical virtuosity and display of which indicate a \nconscious attempt on the poet\u2019s part to revive the formal experimentation characteristic of the \nSilver Age. The \u2018Akhmatova stanza\u2019, as it has come to be known, combines order with a high \nlevel of unpredictability and considerable potential for variation and, in this regard, it invites \ncomparison with recent scientifi c and postmodern rethinking of the relationship between \norder and chaos. Its paradoxical combination of order and disorder fi nds parallels with certain \ntheoretical descriptions of postmodernist poetics which draw upon what is popularly known \nas \u2018chaos theory\u2019, providing useful terminology for describing the stanza, and further grounds \nfor regarding Poem as a pioneering example of Russian postmodernism.\nEarly Russian postmodernism is generally perceived to have arisen from a desire to \u2018revive\u2019 \nor \u2018return to\u2019 modernism, and to \u2018reconnect Russia with a variety of \u201clost\u201d modernist \ntraditions\u2019.5 The development of modernism in Russia was hampered by the imposition of \nsocialist realism and offi cial campaigns against \u2018formalism\u2019, so that this \u2018return\u2019 to modernism \nis inevitably accompanied by a paradoxical awareness of the impossibility of such a move after \nyears of totalitarian control over cultural production. As Lipovetskii observes, early Russian \npostmodernism simultaneously expresses two contradictory tendencies:\nOn the one hand there was the need to return to modernism, to use the aesthetic arsenal of the \nclassics; this is why the works of Russian postmodernists display so many features that are charac-\nteristic of modernist aesthetics. On the other hand, there was the gradual recognition of the impos-\nsibility of \u201crestoring\u201d modernism after decades of totalitarian aesthetics. We fi nd this recognition \nin the search for an ironic contact with or distancing from the modernist classics.6\nPoem is an early expression of this impulse and it certainly displays numerous features char-\nacteristic of modernist aesthetics; in effect, it constitutes a dramatisation of Akhmatova\u2019s \n\u2018return\u2019 to the modernist era from the perspective afforded her by hindsight. The fi rst part of \nthe poem, \u2018Deviat\u00b4sot trinadtsatyi god\u2019 (\u2018The Year Nineteen Thirteen\u2019), involves the visita-\ntion in 1940 of the \u2018author\u2019 by the \u2018shades\u2019 of 1913 and the re-enactment of the memory of \nevents concerning them. As has long been recognised, it contains numerous allusions to \nother texts, many of them dating from the 1910s, and it exhibits an array of typically modern-\nist devices (including spatialized time, a non-linear narrative which imitates the play of the \nmind, collage, and montage), and it reworks characteristically modernist themes (in particular, \nthe harlequinade and apocalypse).\n\u2018The Year Nineteen Thirteen\u2019 is presented by Akhmatova as a self-suffi cient text-within-\na-text, which is then commented upon by a fi ctional \u2018editor\u2019 (a devotee of socialist realism) \nin the metapoetic second part of Poem, \u2018Reshka\u2019 (\u2018Tails\u2019) and then refl ected upon again, \nalbeit to a lesser extent and more obliquely, in the Epilogue. The poem as a whole thereby \nportrays an \u2018author\u2019 character in the process of composing a modernist text, many of the \nfeatures of which are conspicuously old-fashioned and ideologically suspect for the 1940s, \nbut are unmistakably redolent of Silver Age literature. Marina Tsvetaeva\u2019s rather sarcastic \nresponse to an early draft of the poem testifi es to its anachronistic quality and perhaps also to \nits problematic political credentials: \u2018Hado ovladats volswoi cmeloctso, jtovq b 1941 \ng. pncats o Kolomvnhe, Psepo n Apleknhe \u2019 (\u2018One needs to possess great courage in order \nto write about Columbine, Pierrot and Harlequin in 1941\u2019).7 \nA remark made by Brian McHale in relation to James Joyce\u2019s Ulysses (a novel greatly \nadmired by Akhmatova and perceived by her as remarkably similar in conception to her own \ntext)8 serves well to describe Poem Without a Hero:\nPu\nbl\nish\ned\n b\ny \nM\nan\ney\n P\nub\nlis\nhi\nng\n (c\n) W\n. S\n. M\nan\ney\n &\n S\non\n Li\nmi\nted\n 101Anna Akhmatova\u2019s POEM WITHOUT A HERO\nAt one and the same time a founding text of \u201cHigh Modernism\u201d and a postmodernist text, a \u201cdem-\nonstration and summation\u201d of modernist poetics and a parody of modernist poetics; it defi nes and \nconsolidates modernism yet at the same time exceeds and explodes it.9\nPoem too is a \u2018demonstration and summation\u2019 of modernist poetics which \u2018defi nes and \nconsolidates modernism\u2019 by containing within itself a self-conscious representation of a \nmodernist text, \u2018The Year Nineteen Thirteen\u2019, the subject of which is the modernist era. It \nalso \u2018exceeds and explodes\u2019 modernism by juxtaposing the two temporal worlds of 1913 and \n1940, thereby turning Silver Age modernism into an object for evaluation and a target for \nconsiderable irony.\nAs Roman Timenchik demonstrates, Akhmatova consciously, and with polemical and \nparodic intent, makes use of various fragments of the cultural range of 1913 which were \nalready thought of as somewhat hackneyed at the time. For example, he cites the collocation \npouelyihqe plejn (\u2018kissable shoulders\u2019), which Briusov had declared in print to be outdated \nin 1910.10 Akhmatova demonstrates and celebrates modernism, but she also exposes and \nexplodes it by incorporating its more clich\u00e9d moments and establishing an ironic distance \nfrom its language and its hopes for the advent of a new, ideal reality. In \u2018Tails\u2019, she implies \nthat, like her fi ctional editor, she considers the content and themes of \u2018The Year Nineteen \nThirteen\u2019 to be outmoded from the vantage-point of the 1940s:\nN cama r vqla he pada,\n Qtoi adckoi apleknhadq\n  Nzdal\u00ebka zaclqwab boi.11\nAnd I myself was not happy\n When I heard from a distance the howl\n  Of this hellish harlequinade.\nShe also indicates that the arrival of the \u2018Real\u2019 twentieth century marked a complete break \nwith the literary and cultural past:\nN cepevprhqi mecru rpko\n Had cepevprhqm bekom ctql.\n  [. . .]\nA po havepeyhoi legehdaphoi\n Ppnvlnyalcr he kalehdaphqi \u2014\n  Hactorwni Dbaduatqi Bek.12\nAnd the silver moon brightly\n Froze over the silver age.\n  [. . .]\nAnd along the legendary embankment\n Drew nearer not the calendar \u2013\n  But the Real Twentieth Century.\nDubravka Oraic\u02c7 has argued cogently that Akhmatova\u2019s poem belongs to an early post-\nmodernist model, which she calls the \u2018museum of modernist art\u2019.13 In this museum model of \npostmodernism, Oraic\u02c7 states, a relationship is established by the author between his or her \nown text and modernist or avant-garde art.14 This assessment provides independent support \nfor Kikhnei and Temirshina\u2019s reading of Poem as a neo-baroque piece which remythologizes \ncultural ruins and fragments with a view to bringing about a revival of early Russian \nmodernism. These ideas also chime with Timenchik\u2019s view of Akhmatova\u2019s methods, which \nPu\nbl\nish\ned\n b\ny \nM\nan\ney\n P\nub\nlis\nhi\nng\n (c\n) W\n. S\n. M\nan\ney\n &\n S\non\n Li\nmi\nted\n102 Alexandra K. Harrington\nhe characterises in terms of bricolage: she recombines cultural fragments to create her own \nmyth of the Silver Age.\nAkhmatova\u2019s intensive engagement with Silver Age modernism leads, as Timenchik and \nOraic\u02c7 both indicate, to various forms of deep structural quotation. Timenchik fi nds that the \nplot of \u2018The Year Nineteen Thirteen\u2019 is in itself a \u2018sign\u2019 of the poetry of 1913, and illustrates \nthis by reference to poems from the period manifesting close similarities in plot.15 Oraic\u02c7 points \nout that the stepped lines (lesenki) employed by Akhmatova in Poem reveal its close relation-\nship with avant-garde art, recalling the practice of Cubo-Futurist poets such as Vladimir \nMaiakovskii. It might also be argued that the other ways in which Akhmatova brings style and \nthe linguistic medium to the foreground provide further signals of the text\u2019s affi nity with \nturn-of-the-century avant-garde aesthetics in general.16 Her use of capitals, italics and acrostics \nare all ways of exploring the \u2018look\u2019 of the text, of making the poetry impact visually upon the \nreader. For instance:\nV Zbyk wagob tex, kotopqx hety,\nE Po cnrwemy papkety,\nL N cngapq cnhni dqmok.\nQ N bo bcex zepkalax otpaznlcr\nI  Jelobek, jto he porbnlcr\n N ppohnkhyts b tot zal he mog.\nZ Oh he lyjwe dpygnx n he xyye,\nA Ho he beet Leteickoi ctyyei,\nL N b pyke ego teplota.\n Gocts nz Vydywego! \u2014 Heyyeln \n Oh ppndet ko mhe b camom dele,\n Pobephyb halebo c mocta?17\nW The sound of the steps of those who are not here\nH Across the gleaming parquet,\nI And the blue smoke of a cigar.\nT And in all the mirrors\nE The man, who did not appear\n And who could not enter that hall is refl ected.\nH He is not better than the others, nor worse,\nA But he does not waft Lethe\u2019s chill\nL And there is warmth in his hand.\nL Guest from the Future! \u2014 Will he really\n Come to me\n Having turned left at the bridge?\nThe vertically aligned words compel the reader to acknowledge the text\u2019s materiality \nby disrupting a linear reading. Elsewhere in the poem, Akhmatova shapes her poetry into a \nvisual representation of an appropriate object, and uses capitalisation to create the impression \nof a disembodied voice or shout:\nNZ GODA COPOKOBOGO,\n KAK C VAWHN, HA BCE GLRYY.\n  KAK VYDTO PPOWARCS CHOBA\n   C TEM, C JEM DABHO PPOCTNLACS\n    KAK VYDTO PEPEKPECTNLACS\n     N POD TEMHQE CBODQ CXOYY.18\nFROM THE FORTIETH YEAR,\n AS FROM A TOWER, I LOOK AT EVERYTHING.\nPu\nbl\nish\ned\n b\ny \nM\nan\ney\n P\nub\nlis\nhi\nng\n (c\n) W\n.

Poem is \noften praised for its prosodic inventiveness, a quality not usually regarded as characteristic of \nAkhmatova\u2019s poetry,19 and its unique stanza form has been the focus of several studies.20 \nAkhmatova\u2019s view that the failure of Blok\u2019s Vozmezdie (Retribution) resulted from the lack of \na suffi ciently novel stanza form \u2014 a potential pitfall for any poet writing in the wake of \nPushkin\u2019s Evgenii Onegin \u2014 can be seen as a crucial factor in the creation of the stanza form \nfor Poem. Akhmatova was of the opinion that the only way to compose a successful long poem \nis to write against the established rules of the genre.21 In short, the specifi c task which she \nappears to have set herself, as is generally acknowledged, was to \u2018cozdats hejto ppnhunpal-\nsho hoboe, podjepkhyts hepoxoyects ha ppedqdywee\u2019 (\u2018create something principally \nnew, to underline dissimilarity to what has gone before\u2019).22 This necessitated the creation of \na suitable stanza form.\nA number of claims made by Akhmatova in the prose about her poem emphasize the \nwork\u2019s novelty. She writes, for example, \u2018b poqme het hnkakoi tpadnunoh [hoctn]\u2019 (\u2018in the \npoem there is absolutely nothing traditional\u2019) and \u2018taknx poqm hnkto he pncad\u2019 (\u2018no one \nhas ever written such a poem\u2019).23 Similarly, she repeats one reader\u2019s judgment of the work as \npossessing all the qualities of a completely new work in the history of literature owing to its \nrelationship with music, thereby implicitly linking its novelty with its prosody.24 The signifi -\ncance which Akhmatova accorded her stanza is illustrated by her regretful mention of it in a \npoem of 1946, \u2018I uvidel mesiats lukavyi\u2019 (\u2018And the cunning moon saw\u2019):\nTepeps mehr pozavydyt,\nN khngn cghnot b wkafy.\nAxmatobckoi zbats he vydyt\nHn ylnuy, hn ctpofy.\nNow they will forget me\nAnd my books will gather mould in the cupboard\nNo street, nor stanza,\nWill be given the name Akhmatova.\nThe stanza form of Poem establishes a relationship with Symbolist poetry through its musi-\ncality, much as it does with futurism by means of its layout.25 Viktor Zhirmunskii conveyed \nhis views on Poem\u2019s relationship with symbolism to Akhmatova, who repeatedly includes \nthem in different pieces of prose relating to it. She writes, for example:\nB. M. Ynpmyhckni ojehs nhtepecho gobopnl o poqme. Oh ckazal, jto qto ncpolhehne \nmejtq cnmbolnctob, t. e. qto to, jto ohn ppopobedobaln b teopnn, ho hnkogda he \nocywectblrln b cbonx pponzbedehnrx (magnr pntma, bolwevctbo bndehnr), jto b nx poqmax \nhnjego qtogo het.26\nV. M. Zhirmunskii spoke very interestingly about the poem. He said that it is a fulfi lment of the \nSymbolists\u2019 dream; that is, it is that which they advocated in theory, but never realized in their \nworks (magic of rhythm, enchantment of vision), and that in their poems there is none of this.\nPu\nbl\nish\ned\n b\ny \nM\nan\ney\n P\nub\nlis\nhi\nng\n (c\n) W\n. S\n. M\nan\ney\n &\n S\non\n Li\nmi\nted\n104 Alexandra K. Harrington\nThe idea of both demonstrating and exceeding modernism is implicit in this observation. \nIn creating her own stanza form, Akhmatova consciously revives the technical display and \nformalism characteristic of the beginning of the century. Indeed the very title Poem Without a \nHero hints at the primacy of form over content. The poem is based on the dol\u2019nik, a metre \npopularised by Aleksandr Blok,27 used extensively by Akhmatova, and more generally \nparticularly characteristic of the Silver Age. By the 1940s, when Akhmatova began work on \nPoem, Russian poets had become considerably less experimental with form: indeed, from as \nearly as the 1920s poetry had begun to retreat from the kind of prosodic experimentation \nwhich had been prevalent in the 1910s.28\nAkhmatova\u2019s stanza form is unique and distinctive, but like everything else in Poem, it \nhas various intertexts. It bears marked similarities to the stanza form of the second \u2018stroke\u2019 \n(udar) of Mikhail Kuzmin\u2019s poetic cycle of 1927, Forel\u00b4 razbivaet led (The Trout Breaks the Ice), \nas Timenchik was fi rst to observe.29 This similarity is not accidental: Akhmatova had been \nreading Kuzmin\u2019s poem and discussing it with Lidiia Chukovskaia in 1940, the year in which \nshe embarked upon the composition of Poem, and the two works have noticeable thematic \ncorrespondences.30 Kuzmin\u2019s fi rst two stanzas read:\nKohn vsotcr, xpaprt b ncpyge, A\nCnhei lehtoi ovbntq dygn A\nBolkn, cheg, vyvehuq, palsva! b\nJto do ctpawhoi, kak hojs, pacplatq?

His rhyme scheme is regular \nand each stanza divides into halves, which consist of two feminine rhymes and a masculine \nline. The two masculine lines in each stanza do not rhyme with one another.\nAkhmatova\u2019s stanza (here, from \u2018Tails\u2019) follows a similar pattern, but her masculine lines are \nrhymed, unlike Kuzmin\u2019s, and her dol\u00b4nik is ternary:\nN co mhoo mor \u00abCedsmar\u00bb, A\nPolymeptbar n hemar, A\nPot ee cbedeh n otkpqt b\nClobho pot tpagnjeckoi, mackn, C\nHo oh jephoi zamazah kpackoi C\nN cyxoo zemlei havnt.32 D\nNina Lisnianskaia, writing after Timenchik, has uncovered another intertext for the stanza: \nMarina Tsvetaeva\u2019s lyric \u2018Kavaler de Grie\u2019 (\u2018Cavalier de Grieux\u2019), written on New Year\u2019s Eve \n1917 (a signifi cant date, as Poem is set on New Year\u2019s Eve 1940). The fi rst two stanzas of \nTsvetaeva\u2019s poem read:\nKabalep de Gpnq! Happacho A\nBq mejtaete o ppekpachoi, A\nCamoblacthoi, b ceve he blacthoi.

Tsvetaeva\u2019s fi rst three feminine lines are rounded off with a masculine \nline, which rhymes with the fi nal line of the second quatrain. However, in the two quatrains \nwhich follow this quotation, the masculine lines are unrhymed, rendering them rather more \nlike Kuzmin\u2019s stanza. Akhmatova\u2019s stanza follows a pattern similar to that established across \nTsvetaeva\u2019s fi rst two quatrains, as Lisnianskaia demonstrates with the following quotation \nfrom Poem:\nKpnk petywni ham tolsko chntcr, A\n  Za okowkom Heba dqmntcr, A\n    Hojs vezdohha \u2014 n dlntcr, dlntcr \u2014 A\n       Petepvypgckar jeptobhr. . . b\nB jephom heve zbezdq he bndho, C\n  Gnvels gde\u2013to zdecs, ojebndho, C\n     Ho vecpejha, pprha, vecctqdha C\n       Mackapadhar voltobhr.34 b\nLisnianskaia contends that Kuzmin borrowed from Tsvetaeva, and then Akhmatova \nborrowed from them both.26 The shortcoming in her argument is that the example that she \ncites from Poem to illustrate her case is, in fact, an irregular stanza, consisting of eight lines. It \nis taken from \u2018The Year Nineteen Thirteen\u2019, in which departures from the basic six-line \nrhyme scheme are strikingly frequent. Nonetheless, a comparison with the more regular \nstanzas of \u2018Tails\u2019 confi rms that Lisnianskaia\u2019s overall premise has foundation:\nN cama r vqla he pada A\n Qtoi adckoi apleknhadq A\n  Nzdal\u00ebka zaclqwab boi. b\nBce haderlacs r, jto mnmo C\n Veloi zalq, kak xlopsr dqma, C\n  Ppohecetcr ckbozs cympak xboi. b\nAs in \u2018Tails\u2019, the stanza in the Epilogue is six lines in length, but individual stanzas there are \nnot separated by numbers or line spacing:\nTak pod kpoblei Fohtahhogo doma, A\nGde bejephrr vpodnt nctoma A\nC fohapem n cbrzkoi klojei, \u2014 b\nR aykalacs c dalshnm qxom, C\nHeymecthqm cmywar cmexom C\nHeppovydhyo cohs bewei. b\nGde cbndetels bcego ha cbete, A\nHa zakate n ha paccbete A\nCmotpnt b komhaty ctapqi kleh b\nN ppedbndr hawy pazlyky, C\nMhe nccoxwyo jephyo pyky, C\nKak za pomowso, trhet oh.36 b\nIn short, Akhmatova\u2019s stanza possesses the same metre as Tsvetaeva\u2019s, and incorporates \nrhyming masculine lines, as does hers, but in its most common variant it is the length of \nPu\nbl\nish\ned\n b\ny \nM\nan\ney\n P\nub\nlis\nhi\nng\n (c\n) W\n.

It is a genuine blend of these two precursors, but it exceeds them both in its \npotential for variation.\nAkhmatova\u2019s stanza is at its most complex and varied in \u2018The Year Nineteen Thirteen\u2019, the \npart of the poem that conjures up the Silver Age and constitutes a text-within-a-text. After \nthis, in \u2018Tails\u2019 and the Epilogue, order establishes itself. \u2018The Year Nineteen Thirteen\u2019 begins \nas follows (the dividing lines, which are not present in Akhmatova\u2019s text, indicate stanza \nbreaks):\n1 R zaygla zabethqe cbejn, A\n  Jtovq qtot cbetnlcr bejep, A\n    N c tovoi, ko mhe he ppnwedwnm, A\n  Copok pepbqi bctpejao god. b\n5  Ho\u2026\n  Gocpodhrr cnla c hamn!

The rhyme scheme of the fi rst stanza (lines 1\u20137) is characterised \nby inexact rhymes (cbejn is rhymed with bejep), and the stanza is seven lines long. The \nsecond stanza consists of six lines with exact rhymes: vecedq and vpedq, vsot and yot, \ntpeboge and popoge. Moreover, the pattern does not clearly establish itself until later in the \ntext. This variation makes the pattern initially diffi cult for the reader to discern, and an \nappreciation of the basic stanza is complicated by the range of expanded and contracted \nversions of it which appear throughout \u2018The Year Nineteen Thirteen\u2019.\nAs all this suggests, Akhmatova\u2019s stanza is highly complex and elastic. It consists of a basic \nrhyme scheme (AAbCCb) from which the poet departs periodically by adding extra rhyming \nlines. This is the case, for instance, with lines 30\u201331 above, which were a relatively late addi-\ntion to the text in comparison with the lines surrounding them. As lines 1\u20133, 26\u201330, and \n36\u201340 illustrate, any number of additional rhyming feminine lines can potentially be included. \nIt is also possible for extra masculine lines to be inserted, as with line 31. Lines 26 to 36, there-\nfore, contain a mixture of interpolated feminine and masculine rhyming lines, the addition of \nwhich allows the stanza to be expanded. These expansions bear, of course, upon semantics: \nthey tend to coincide with particularly dramatic or chaotic episodes in the narrative, such as \nthe arrival of the masquerade fi gures, their effect being to heighten the tension and sense of \nensuing catastrophe.\nOver the four parts of \u2018The Year Nineteen Thirteen\u2019, approximately sixty per cent of the \nstanzas are six lines in length, with the other forty per cent varying between four lines and \neleven. At times, it becomes almost impossible to determine where one stanza ends and the \nnext begins. For instance:\nCahjo Pahcq n Doh-Knxotq A\n  N, ybq, codomckne Lotq A\n    Cmeptohochqi ppovyot cok, b\nAfpodntq bozhnkln nz pehq, C\n  Webelshylncs b ctekle Elehq, C\n    N vezymsr vlnzntcr cpok. b\nN oprts nz Fohtahhogo Gpota, D\n  Gde lovobhar ctqhet dpemota, D\n    Jepez ppnzpajhqe bopota, D\n      N moxhatqi n pqyni kto-to D\n        Kozlohogyo ppnbolok.38 b\nThe new rhyme in line 7 seems to begin a new stanza. However, the masculine rhyme of \nthe preceding stanza (line 6) is echoed in the fi nal line of the quotation. Subsequent lines \nbegin a new pattern of rhymes altogether. This example could therefore be thought of either \nas a six-line stanza followed by a fi ve-line stanza, or as an eleven-line one. The Akhmatova \nstanza incorporates a level of unpredictability and fl exibility which expresses formally the \nPu\nbl\nish\ned\n b\ny \nM\nan\ney\n P\nub\nlis\nhi\nng\n (c\n) W\n. S\n.

Harrington\npervasive disintegration and chaos that are an essential part of the thematics of \u2018The Year \nNineteen Thirteen\u2019, which deals with the destructive advent of war and revolution.\nKornei Chukovskii\u2019s impressionistic description of Akhmatova\u2019s stanza identifi es organic \nties between the metre and rhythm of the poem and its themes, as well as highlighting the \nnovelty of Akhmatova\u2019s stanza form:\n[. . .] hanvolswyo qmounohalshyo cnly kaydomy nz ovpazob poqmq ppndaet ee tpeboyhqi \nn ctpacthqi pntm, opgahnjeckn cbrzahhqi c ee tpeboyhoi n ctpacthoi tematnkoi.

This \ncapricious combination of two anapaestic feet, now with an amphibrach, now with a single iambic \nfoot, may be called \u2018Akhmatova\u2019: as far as I am aware, such a rhythmic system (and, equally, such \na stanza form) were up to this point unknown in Russian poetry.\nZhirmunskii also comments upon the metre and rhythm of the stanza and, like Chukovskii, \nhe emphasises its novelty. However, where Chukovskii sees intricacy and capriciousness, \nZhirmunskii discerns regularity:\nBcled za Pywknhom n Hekpacobqm, Vlokom (b Dbehaduatn) n Markobcknm Axmatoba \novpatnlacs b \u00abPoqme vez gepor\u00bb k ponckam hoboi fopmq.

The special stanza, which has already received \nthe name \u2018Akhmatova stanza\u2019, became this form. At its base lies the dol\u2019nik \u2014 a three-stress line \nwith a varying number of unstressed syllables between stresses (one or two) and before the fi rst \nstress, typical of Akhmatova\u2019s lyrics. In the poem, in comparison with her lyrics, Akhmatova\u2019s \ndol\u2019nik displays a more regular form: the beginning of the line is always anapaestic (two unstressed \nsyllables before the fi rst stress). In front of one of the two remaining stresses there can stand one \nunstressed syllable (an iambic foot), then in front of the other in the same line there will be two \nunstressed syllables (an anapaestic foot); or both feet are anapaestic, like the fi rst.\nZhirmunskii identifi es the three standard rhythmic variations to which Akhmatova\u2019s lines \nare subject. As his and Chukovskii\u2019s individual descriptions suggest when read alongside one \nanother, a tension between order and disorder is a key feature of the Akhmatova stanza\u2019s \nmetrical properties, as well as its rhyme. It is characterized on the one hand by regularity, yet \non the other by its capacity for variation, complexity and its inherent elasticity. This latter \ncharacteristic allowed Akhmatova to develop what, for her, as Vitalii Vilenkin remarks, was \nan \u2018atypical method of composition\u2019, amplifying her text almost endlessly, rather than altering \nand cutting it.41\nThe paradoxical and innovative combination of order and disorder manifest in Akhma-\ntova\u2019s stanza leads irresistibly in the direction of Russian postmodernist theory, in particular \nLipovetskii\u2019s characterisation of postmodernist poetics as a \u2018dialogue with chaos\u2019.

M\nan\ney\n &\n S\non\n Li\nmi\nted\n 109Anna Akhmatova\u2019s POEM WITHOUT A HERO\npin down what distinguishes postmodernist works from the literature which precedes them, \nLipovetskii invokes the branch of modern science popularly known as \u2018chaos theory\u2019. Over \nthe last quarter of a century or so, scientists have reconceived chaos as complexity, rather than \nas total disorder, and have discovered that order can be concealed within, or can arise from, \na chaotic system. \u2018Chaos\u2019 turns out to be a misnomer. Lipovetskii is not alone in his perception \nthat postmodernism \u2018quite naturally takes its place alongside these theories\u2019.42 Various western \nliterary critics have also drawn extensive and often illuminating parallels between scientifi c \nmodels of chaos and postmodernist poetics. N. Katherine Hayles, one of the most prominent \namong these, believes there to be a strong similarity between chaos theory and Derridian \ndeconstruction.43 Scholars of Joyce\u2019s work often invoke scientifi c models in their interpreta-\ntions of his fi ction (it is perhaps relevant that Akhmatova herself, as mentioned earlier, thought \nof Ulysses and Poem as remarkably similar in conception to one another).44 Some researchers \nremain adamantly opposed to the idea that chaos theory can usefully be applied to literature, \nand those literary scholars who draw elaborate parallels between postmodernist poetics and \nscientifi c theory frequently lay themselves open to charges of factual inaccuracy or of making \n\u2018intellectual impostures\u2019.45 It nonetheless seems perfectly legitimate for other disciplines \nto draw upon science as a conceptual resource and to borrow apposite terminology from \nscientifi c discourse, provided that it is acknowledged that this usage has been adopted for their \nown specifi c purposes.\nPostmodernism, in Lipovetskii\u2019s view, differs from the literature that precedes it by making \nchaos \u2018an equal participant in the dialogue with the artist\u2019 and admitting it into the very \nstructure of a literary work. In this respect, the traditional privileging of order over chaos is \nrethought in postmodernism. The postmodernist writer strives to \u2018overcome the binary \nopposition of chaos and cosmos [. . .] and to redirect the creative impulse toward a compromise \nbetween these universals\u2019.46 Lipovetskii (following Umberto Eco) borrows the Joycean term \n\u2018chaosmos\u2019 to describe this paradoxical combination of order and disorder, and argues that \npostmodernist compromises between the two, rather than resolving contradictions, lead to a \nnew intellectual space for the constant interaction of binary oppositions.47\nA corresponding capacity of Akhmatova\u2019s poem has often been observed in criticism. For \nexample, Tat\u2019iana Tsiv\u2019ian identifi es:\nat least [. . .] two hypostases of the poem that are in opposition, and even almost in contradiction, \nto each other and which, nevertheless, not only co-exist in time and space but, moreover, form a \nreal unity of opposites.48\nThe two hypostases upon which she focuses in detail are spontaneity and premeditation, \nPoem being presented as the creation of both at the same time. Akhmatova repeatedly casts \nher poem as an entity which came to her unbidden and complete \u2014 \u2018R he zbala ee\u2019 (\u2018I didn\u2019t \ncall her\u2019), yet the notions of authorship and literariness are also continually highlighted \u2014 \n\u2018Tpn \u00abk\u00bb bqpayaot zamewatelsctbo abtopa\u2019 (\u2018The three \u2018k\u2019s express the author\u2019s confu-\nsion\u2019). This paradox gives rise to various related oppositions, such as that between fi nishedness \n\u2014 \u2018\u00abEye pncaxm \u2014 pncaxm\u00bb\u2019 (\u2018What is written is written\u2019) \u2014 and unfi nishability \u2014 \u2018Pahswe \npoqma kohjalacs tak\u2019 (\u2018Formerly, the poem ended thus\u2019), or that between inarticulate \nsound (the Blokian gyl or \u2018rumbling sound\u2019 which pervades the Petersburg of 1913) and the \nword (the use of jyyoe clobo or \u2018alien discourse\u2019 in the poem\u2019s construction). The poem \nis the product, as Tsiv\u00b4ian observes, both of \u2018divine sound\u2019 \u2014 or perhaps something closer \nto postmodernist noise? \u2014 and a \u2018sober, precise plan\u2019 according to which information is \nPu\nbl\nish\ned\n b\ny \nM\nan\ney\n P\nub\nlis\nhi\nng\n (c\n) W\n.

This doubling is the basis of its structure, in the depths of which lies this \u2018amal-\ngamation of two opposites\u2019.49 Throughout the poem other binary categories often blurred in \npostmodernism, such as centre and periphery, become diffi cult to distinguish, and the work \nas a whole is an amorphous hybrid, which constantly spills over its own boundaries and threat-\nens to turn into something else altogether, be it play, ballet, or screenplay. Moreover, the \nspeaker is herself unable to distinguish between opposite categories:\nZolotogo ls beka bndehse\n  Nln jephoe ppectyplehse\n    B gpozhom xaoce dabhnx dhei?50\nIs this a vision of the Golden Age\n  Or a black crime\n    In the menacing chaos of bygone days?\nThe image of a golden age suggests perfection and harmony (especially in connection with \nDostoevskii, to whom these lines clearly allude), whereas the reference to a \u2018black crime\u2019 is \nredolent of evil and disintegration. The suggestion is that the Silver Age is neither, and both, \nof these opposites. Elsewhere in her later work, Akhmatova displays her interest in cosmog-\nony and explores the role of chaos in the process of creation: this is particularly apparent in \nthe fi rst of her \u2018Severnye elegii\u2019 (\u2018Northern elegies\u2019), \u2018Predystoriia\u2019 (\u2018Prehistory\u2019), in which she \ndepicts Dostoevskii rising up above primordial chaos and creating the chaotic, out-of-joint \nworld into which she and her generation were born.51 The traditional passage from chaos to \nform is recast as a passage from primordial chaos to a different kind of chaos. Akhmatova\u2019s \nproject in Poem, which is closely related to \u2018Prehistory\u2019, is to fi nd appropriate forms for \nconveying the \u2018menacing chaos\u2019 of the past.52\nAkhmatova\u2019s stanza form in Poem, which is characterised by an underlying order that is \ninitially diffi cult to discern as it permits extensive variation, can be described in terms of \u2018cha-\nosmos\u2019. This term provides a means of characterizing the stanza as a complex system and of \naccounting for its particular features. These particular features can, in turn, be described by \ninvoking scientifi c terminology. One of the peculiarities of the stanza form in Poem is that the \nbasic pattern emerges slowly, only achieving consistent regularity in \u2018Tails\u2019. In this respect, \nanalogies can be drawn with the \u2018dissipative structures\u2019 discovered by Ilia Prigogine in the \n1970s; these being dynamic, self-propagating systems which undergo a transformation from \nthe apparently chaotic to the increasingly ordered. These systems are unbalanced, open ones, \nwhich interact with their environment \u2014 similarly, Akhmatova\u2019s dynamic stanza allows new \nmaterial from outside the text to be introduced and absorbed into it. Moreover, concealed \nwithin the unpredictability of the stanza in \u2018The Year Nineteen Thirteen\u2019 are deep structures \nof order that might be thought of in terms of \u2018recursive symmetry\u2019, a feature of chaotic systems \nwhereby the same general form is repeated across different length scales, as though it is \nprogressively enlarged or diminished. The expansions and contractions of the basic six-line \nstanza in \u2018The Year Nineteen Thirteen\u2019 constitute different-length repetitions of the same \ngeneral form. To think of order as relative, as the replication of symmetries that permit \nasymmetries and unpredictability, provides a means of characterising the Akhmatova stanza\u2019s \npeculiar combination of pattern with capricious departures from that pattern. \nLipovetskii concludes that the close interaction between postmodernist poetics and the \nworld model of chaos, which he sees as expressed in the breakdown of the artistic system\u2019s \ntraditional structures, does not necessarily result in the fragmentation of artistic unity.

The \u2018museum\u2019, bricolage, or \n\u2018neo-baroque\u2019 models of intertextuality allow old cultural systems to survive at the same time \nas a new poetical system, from which the old one is evaluated, comes into being. In Poem, \nAkhmatova is engaged in a two-fold project: on the one hand she celebrates and preserves the \nliterary past, and on the other she innovates and revitalises old forms to create a new poetic \nsystem. Her complex stanza is one of the most sophisticated expressions of this dual impulse.\n1 St. Petersburg: A Cultural History, trans. by Antonina W.
