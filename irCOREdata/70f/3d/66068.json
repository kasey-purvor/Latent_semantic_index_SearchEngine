Single strategies\u2014for example, the\nprovision of guidelines\u2014are unlikely to have an\nimpact on clinical outcomes, and new, conjoint\nmodels of care need to be explored.\nIntroduction\nHeart failure is difficult to define and diagnose.1 It is\ncommon, increasing in prevalence, and has high mor\u203a\nbidity and mortality akin to common cancers.2 It is\nmanaged largely in primary care, imposing a heavy\nburden on the NHS, and accounts for 5% of\nadmissions to medical wards, with high readmission\nrates.3 4\nDiagnosis by clinical assessment is difficult and is\ncorrect in less than half of cases confirmed by\nechocardiography.5 6 Heart failure is poorly managed\nin general practice for many reasons.7\u201311 Uncertainty\nabout diagnosis8 11; lack of access to diagnostic\nservices10; lack of awareness of research evidence and\nguidelines7 9; worries about adverse effects, cost, and\ninconvenience of angiotensin converting enzyme\ninhibitors7; and poor communication between profes\u203a\nsionals in primary and secondary care11 lead to variable\npractice, and the reasons for this variability need to be\nelucidated further.\nMuch of the current evidence on how to diagnose\nand manage heart failure comes from a secondary care\nperspective, where the difficulties of primary care,\nincluding differences in patient populations, are not\nnecessarily appreciated. Studies have usually relied on\nquantitative methods, with little exploration of the\ncomplexity of general practice and its relations with\npatients and secondary care.7 10\nThis study aimed to ascertain the beliefs, current\npractices, and decision making of general practitioners\naround the diagnosis and management of suspected\nheart failure in primary care, with a view to identifying\nbarriers to optimal care.\nMethods\nFocus groups with general practitioners were our\nchosen format for the study, which was set in north east\nEngland, an area with a population of 617 532 and\nwith 316 general practitioners in 88 practices. We used\na mixed purposive sampling strategy to select\nparticipants.12 Stratification of general practitioners\nallowed proportionate representation of sex, ethnic\ngroup, geographical distribution, employment status\n(part time or full time), and practice size (group or\nsinglehanded) and avoided selecting general practi\u203a\ntioners from the same practice. We contacted 41\ngeneral practitioners and organised four focus groups.\nCentre for\nIntegrated Health\nCare Research,\nWolfson Research\nInstitute, University\nof Durham,\nStockton\u203aon\u203aTees\nTS17 6BH\nAhmet Fuat\nNorthern and\nYorkshire Regional\nHealth Authority\nresearch training\nfellow\nA Pali S Hungin\nprofessor of primary\ncare and general\npractice\nDarlington\nMemorial Hospital,\nDarlington, County\nDurham DL3 6HX\nJeremy James\nMurphy\nconsultant\ncardiologist\nCorrespondence to:\nA Fuat\nahmet@fuat.\nfreeserve.co.uk\nbmj.com 2003;326:196\npage 1 of 6BMJ VOLUME 326 25 JANUARY 2003 bmj.com\nEleven doctors did not attend; their demographic and\nprofessional characteristics did not differ from the\nremaining 30. The four focus groups consisted of six to\neight participants, and a co\u203amoderator was used in\nthree of them.\nThe 30 participants (25 men, overall age range\n33\u203a64 years, years since graduation 10\u203a42) represented\na wide range of practice size and length of experience,\nincluding three singlehanded practices. Twenty seven\ndoctors worked full time and three part time; 20 (66%)\nhad open access echocardiography. The ratio of male\nto female general practitioners in the locality was 3:1;\nin the focus groups it was 5:1.\nTo help the discussion the principal investigator\n(AF) used a list of points to be considered, compiled\nfrom a literature review. The sessions were audiotaped,\ntranscribed, and then corrected and verified by AF.\nAnalysis\nWe analysed the contents of the interviews following\nthe principles of the theory of \u201cpragmatic variant\u201d\ngrounded theory.13 14 We read transcripts and identified\nbroad themes as the groups progressed. This iterative\nprocess allowed ideas and thoughts that were\nemerging to be brought back to subsequent groups. We\nanalysed deviant cases to question widely accepted\npractice.14 No new major themes arose by the end of\nthe fourth focus group, implying that saturation was\nbeing reached.14 The transcripts were read several\ntimes, data organised into codes from which categories\nwere identified, and major themes were constructed by\nAF and APSH. All three investigators contributed to\nmultiple coding and agreed final themes. Analysis was\nenhanced by constant comparison with the transcripts\nand available research in this field from the initial\nliterature review.14\nRespondent validation\nTo validate the findings we sent all 30 participants a\nreport summarising the study results and conclu\u203a\nsions.15 Of 28 respondents 27 \u201cstrongly agreed\u201d or\n\u201cagreed\u201d and one \u201cneither agreed, nor disagreed\u201d that\nthe report was an accurate representation of their\nopinions and the group outcomes.\nResults\nWe identified three themes that contributed to reasons\nfor the variation in medical practice and why general\npractitioners experienced difficulties in diagnosing and\nmanaging heart failure: firstly, uncertainty about clini\u203a\ncal practice, including the availability and use of\nechocardiographic services; secondly, lack of aware\u203a\nness of relevant research evidence; and thirdly,\ninfluences of individual references and local organisa\u203a\ntional factors.\nUncertainty about clinical practice\nMost participants expressed a lack of confidence in\nestablishing the diagnosis of heart failure. This affected\nthe management of individual patients. Three main\ncategories were identified: the diagnostic process, avail\u203a\nability and use of echocardiography services, and treat\u203a\nment issues.\nThe diagnostic process\nHeart failure was perceived to be a difficult diagnosis to\nmake in general practice because of:\nx Problems with subtlety of clinical symptoms and\nsigns: \u201cSome of the clinical signs, if you have a raised\nJVP or third heart sound, hepatomegaly, are often dif\u203a\nficult in the obese to detect, and ankle oedema is\ncommon anyway.\u201d\nx Difficulty in differential diagnosis, especially in\nelderly patients with comorbidity such as chronic\nobstructive airways disease and obesity: \u201cI think heart\nfailure would be not too difficult a subject if it occurred\nin young fit people but the biggest problem is that it\u2019s\nalways inevitably older people who get it. It\u2019s a\nco\u203apathology intermingled with other things, and that\nmakes it often quite difficult to disentangle.\u201d\nx Time constraints and generally increasing clinical\nand administrative workload for general practitioners:\n\u201c20 plus patient surgeries, and having to try and stick to\nclose to 10 minutes, it can be quite difficult to do a\nreally full assessment.\u201d\nx Lack of availability of diagnostic tests, including\nelectrocardiography, chest radiography, and echo\u203a\ncardiography, and lack of confidence in interpreting\nthe results of these: \u201cYou get a kind of slightly reduced\nejection fraction, and you know an iffy tricuspid valve\nor two, and you know you\u2019re not really that much\nfurther forward.\u201d\nx Inertia or fear of initiating action because of anxie\u203a\nties about committing to an intensive course of action,\nincluding investigations, initiation, titration, and moni\u203a\ntoring of treatment: \u201cI think it\u2019s the milder degrees of\nheart failure . . . that is the difficulty. But once you\u2019ve\ndiagnosed it you\u2019re committed to a course of action,\nand I suppose it seems quite a drastic course of action,\nyou\u2019ve obviously got the diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and\npossibly other medication as well, full investigations,\nand I suppose that could lead to a bit of inertia,\ncouldn\u2019t it.\u201d\nx Patients\u2019 choices, including reluctance to be\ninvestigated or treated further: \u201cSome patients\nobviously don\u2019t want to be hospitalised or don\u2019t want a\nsecond opinion, and sometimes don\u2019t want to go to\nhospital, so you end up treating them yourself.\u201d\nAvailability and use of echocardiography services\nPerceived handicaps included the variability of open\naccess echocardiography in the same locality; two\nthirds of the participants had this facility. Some of the\ninequity resulted from the continuation of access\nacquired previously by general practice fundholders.\nSeveral of the open access services had been funded\nthrough pharmaceutical sponsorship but disappeared\nas \u201cmonies dried up.\u201d A further perceived problem was\nvariability in echocardiography reporting, some by\ntechnicians and some by clinicians, and a lack of guid\u203a\nance for using the procedure or for standardising\nrequest forms.\nDifficulties for general practitioners concerning\nechocardiography\nSome general practitioners did not use open access\nechocardiography even when it was available, chiefly\nbecause of not being able to understand it and the\ninconvenience caused to patients who were often very\nill. The reasons given included:\nx Uncertainty about the importance of results and\ninterpretation of technical reports: \u201cThe problem with\nechocardiograms is that I really just don\u2019t understand\nPrimary care\npage 2 of 6 BMJ VOLUME 326 25 JANUARY 2003 bmj.com\nthem. I don\u2019t think of myself as being really that old, I\nmean I\u2019m 43 . . . and when I went through my postreg\u203a\nistration years echocardiograms just weren\u2019t around . . .\nI just don\u2019t know where I am with them. When does an\nejection fraction of such and such per cent stop being\nreasonable and start being a problem?\u201d\nx Not being able to cope with echocardiography,\nmany preferred to refer the patient to a consultant: \u201cI\nwould rather refer than do an echocardiogram, the\ninterpretation of which I am not confident with.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m\nnot confident in diagnosis of heart failure. I think I just\nlike to have it rubber stamped.\u201d\nx Distance to nearest echocardiography clinic may\ninconvenience patients: \u201cIt takes a whole day to go to\nhospital, and for an elderly person with breathlessness\nthat\u2019s a long day, ambulance there and back, sit in a\nwaiting room, and patients do it once and they won\u2019t\ndo it again, and they don\u2019t all have relatives to take\nthem in.\u201d\nGeneral practitioners were less likely to use open\naccess echocardiography when reports were technical\nand lacked a clinical opinion than when a clinician\nguided report was available. In these circumstances\nthey either treated their patients\u2019 symptoms or referred\nthem to hospital; a lack of open access was cited as a\nreason for increased referrals. Apprehension was\nexpressed about overloading cardiology services, espe\u203a\ncially with patients who seemed well: \u201cI think there is\nalso a feeling that it\u2019s almost an inappropriate cardiac\nreferral . . . the cardiologists are so busy and when you\nfirst make the diagnosis they [the patients] are often\nactually not that poorly.\u201d\nTreatment issues\nUncertainty about diagnosis cast doubts on the\ndevelopment of strategies for individual treatment of\npatients. The treatment process was an area that\nentailed further barriers to evidence based practice.\nDoctors had good awareness of non\u203a\npharmacological advice and interventions (such as\nweight reduction, tailored exercise, restriction of salt\nintake) for patients with heart failure.16 Most partici\u203a\npants agreed the importance of educating patients, but\nsome expressed concerns at informing patients about\nthe diagnosis as this might lead to anxiety. This was\ncountered by those who believed that openness with\nand involvement of patients improved compliance.\nConcerns about using ACE inhibitors in general practice\nAlthough attitudes were felt to be changing, worries\nstill surrounded the use of angiotensin converting\nenzyme (ACE) inhibitors, especially about starting\ntreatment in primary care as opposed to in hospital,\npartly because of previous teaching and a fear of side\neffects, mainly hypotension, in the community setting:\nx Concerns about the use of angiotensin converting\nenzyme inhibitors in elderly patients and those with\nrenal impairment and worries about side effects\nincluding cough, postural hypotension, and renal\nfailure: \u201cI\u2019m not too sure exactly at what degree of renal\nimpairment one should worry too much.\u201d\nx Polypharmacy and drug interactions was consid\u203a\nered a barrier, especially in elderly patients: \u201cThe other\nthing that raises its head is polypharmacy here, where\nyou have got your people who have been chewing their\naspirin for years, that a lot of these will be on statins\nand antiarthritic drugs. You\u2019ve got your ACE inhibitors\nand diuretics. Well that\u2019s five or six [drugs], and I think\nyou\u2019re going to have rebellion on your hands from\npeople who say they are on far too many tablets . . .\u201d\nx Ageism was flagged up as a consideration in all four\ngroups: \u201cI think there is an ageist agenda with it as well\nbecause you know somebody of 60 who has got heart\nfailure you\u2019re going to be much more aggressive with\nthan someone who is 78, not just in terms of making\nthe diagnosis but the investigations and treatment.\u201d\nx A few general practitioners were happy to keep\npatients taking diuretics and \u201cspare them the ACE\ninhibitor unless they are getting worse.\u201d\nx A minority\u2019s perception was that diuretics alone are\n\u201cOK in mild heart failure.\u201d\nBarriers to achieving optimal doses of ACE inhibitors in\ngeneral practice\nEven if treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme\ninhibitors was initiated in primary care, a further\nbarrier was the inability to attain the recommended\ndoses as in major studies and guidelines16:\nx Worry that the diagnosis of heart failure was incor\u203a\nrect: \u201cBut it worries me that if you are pushing the ACE\ninhibitors up to the maximum dose, which you are rec\u203a\nommended to do, that you\u2019ve got your diagnosis right\nin the first place.\u201d\nx Although some awareness of the benefits of high\ndose existed, a lack of knowledge of target doses used\nin major trials became apparent.\nx Worries were expressed about \u201chuge doses\u201d leading\nto side effects and intolerance.\nx Reluctance to increase dosage if patient was asymp\u203a\ntomatic or stable: \u201cIf you\u2019ve got someone who is stable,\nyou\u2019re sometimes a bit reluctant to increase the dosage\nof any medication if the condition is well controlled.\u201d\nx It was assumed that it may be more difficult to\nincrease dosage \u201cif already been on a low dose for a\nwhile.\u201d\nAwareness of the use of \u00e2 blockers in heart failure\nwas widespread, but a unanimous feeling was that it\nshould be a \u201chospital initiated thing,\u201d because of a fear\nthat patients might collapse in the community setting.17\nMost doctors were apprehensive about the use of \u00e2\nblockers, and one, voicing fears, indicated that it was\n\u201ccommon sense for general practitioners to be a little\nbit reticent.\u201d Most general practitioners mentioned\nmedical school teaching that emphasised that \u00e2 block\u203a\ners were contraindicated in heart failure: \u201cIt still seems\na contradiction when we were taught \u00e2 blockers\nprecipitate cardiac failure. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve all seen that\nhappen and to turn round and prescribe them; it goes\nagainst the grain a bit.\u201d\nMost general practitioners indicated that they were\nunaware of the place for other agents including\nspironolactone and angiotensin II antagonists in treat\u203a\ning heart failure16; and in spite of its previous use over\nmany centuries digoxin posed a problem: \u201cI\u2019m not\n(even) up to speed with spironolactone or \u00e2 blockers\nyet.\u201d A common response was: \u201cDigoxin: I wouldn\u2019t use\nit in sinus rhythm.\u201d\nLack of awareness of relevant research evidence\nAll focus groups discussed their views on the dissemi\u203a\nnation of research evidence, guidelines, and applicabil\u203a\nity of evidence in primary care. Overload with\nPrimary care\npage 3 of 6BMJ VOLUME 326 25 JANUARY 2003 bmj.com\ninformation was seen as a common cause of stress.\nMany worried about the \u201crapidity of change in all\nfields\u201d and \u201ckeeping up to date with changes\u201d but\nbelieved that \u201c[we] owe it to our patients\u201d to be in\ntouch.\nExisting guidelines about the diagnosis and\nmanagement of heart failure and treatment with\nangiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors were not\nfamiliar to most participants. To some extent this was\ndue to \u201cguideline fatigue\u201d; one general practitioner felt\n\u201cbombarded and bamboozled by guidelines.\u201d\nSpecific to heart failure was the lack of awareness of\nthe importance of confirming left ventricular systolic\ndysfunction, differences between systolic and diastolic\nheart failure, and the importance of the NYHA (New\nYork Heart Association) classification\u2014a system of\ngrading the severity of heart failure\u2014in categorising\nheart failure. A lack of knowledge became obvious as\nto how this classification could be used to provide a\nprognosis and guide management.\nSome general practitioners were happy to keep\npatients taking diuretics alone, possibly unaware of\npotential benefits of angiotensin converting enzyme\ninhibitors, \u00e2 blockers, and spironolactone.16 17 Most had\nlittle knowledge of the place for agents other than diu\u203a\nretics and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors,\nand a feeling predominated in some quarters that\nheart failure should be managed in secondary care:\n\u201cCan we adequately manage heart failure in general\npractice, given the modern advances that we are all\nunsure about?\u201d\nInfluences of personal preference and local\norganisational factors\nMedical training, anecdotal experiences, and outside\nagencies (health authorities, primary care trusts, and\nthe pharmaceutical industry) emerged as influences on\nindividual clinicians\u2019 behaviour and professional\nculture. In some instances this was deeply entrenched\nand perversely affected newer influences. An example\nof this was a participant from a large teaching practice\nwho justified his reluctance to refer all patients for\nechocardiography; the factors behind this are likely to\nbe complex and to do with coming to terms with a rap\u203a\nidly changing medical environment: \u201cI got through the\nwhole of hospital training, and we didn\u2019t use\nechocardiograms. In cardiology we managed everyone\nwith heart failure without an echocardiogram.\u201d\nLocal organisational factors around the provision\nof diagnostic services, such as open access echocardio\u203a\ngraphy, resources, lack of cardiologists, and profes\u203a\nsional interactions between primary and secondary\ncare shaped practice and decision making processes\namong general practitioners. A locality based, contex\u203a\ntualised approach was found acceptable:\nx \u201cA locally drawn up set of guidelines which are per\u203a\ntinent to the local situation, that is primary and\nsecondary care situations, drawn up by representatives\nfrom both primary and secondary care and other\ninterested stakeholders that is owned by everyone who\nis going to use them.\u201d\nx \u201cWe are in an imperfect health service, and we are\nresource starved, and if like every other medical prob\u203a\nlem we deal with, if we wanted to manage heart failure\nas we would like to, it\u2019s going to have significant\nresource implications.\u201d\nWaiting lists and the local availability of consultants\ninfluenced the general practitioner\u2019s decision in\nrelation to the referral to cardiologists of patients with\nsuspected heart failure: \u201cBeing pragmatic you look at\nwaiting lists, we\u2019ve got some very good geriatricians\nwho have excellent clinical skills, and certainly, if the\npatient has got multiple pathologies, I would have no\nhesitation in referring to them.\u201d\nDiscussion\nHeart failure is poorly managed in the United\nKingdom, mainly because of inaccurate diagnosis and\ninappropriate treatment, including the use of treat\u203a\nment for heart failure in a large group of patients who\ndo not actually have heart failure.8 18 A major reason\nfor failing to make an accurate diagnosis is that the\nsymptoms and signs are not highly specific.19 This\nstudy provides information about the difficulties\nperceived by general practitioners in achieving\naccurate diagnosis and instituting modern treatment.16\nThe most accurate method of diagnosis entails the\nuse of echocardiography, but this study confirmed a\nvariation in its availability and discovered that\npractitioners were not confident about interpreting\nresults.20 At the same time a reluctance to refer to a\nconsultant for a definitive diagnosis prevailed because\nof a fear of overloading services and a continuing per\u203a\nception that heart failure remains a problem to be\ndealt with in primary care.\nPerceived advantages and disadvantages of modern\nmanagement\nDiagnosis and management of heart failure have\nevolved dramatically, such that they rely on specialised\ninvestigations and drug regimens that often require spe\u203a\ncialist input. Clinicians who trained in the distant past\nhave essentially not come to terms with the more\nmodern approach. In turn, services to capitalise on\nmodern management have been insufficiently devel\u203a\noped.\nParadoxically, the general practitioners appreciated\nthe benefits of modern treatment shown in large scale\ntrials, particularly those of angiotensin converting\nenzyme inhibitors.16 Although confidence in the use of\nangiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors has\nincreased in the past 10 years, a substantial minority of\ngeneral practitioners were reluctant to use them, espe\u203a\ncially in elderly patients. This was related to fears about\nside effects, especially hypotension and collapse in the\ncommunity setting, and the lack of monitoring\nguidelines in the context of primary care.\nPolypharmacy was viewed particularly negatively. If\nbetween one and five drugs are prescribed, the\nlikelihood of adverse drug reactions is 3.4%, rising to\n24% with six or more.21 The increased numbers of tab\u203a\nlets likely to be required by elderly patients with\nconcurrent conditions, such as diabetes and its associ\u203a\nated problems, was considered daunting and detract\u203a\ning from compliance. In such situations decisions\nabout the most appropriate regimens were likely to be\nweighted by the requirements of the different\nconditions and perceived returns from intervention.\nAlthough chronic heart failure is serious and progres\u203a\nsive and appropriate drug intervention proved to be\nbeneficial, many clinicians do not find it easy to judge\nPrimary care\npage 4 of 6 BMJ VOLUME 326 25 JANUARY 2003 bmj.com\nthe extent of worthwhile returns in older patients with\nunderlying problems such as ischaemic heart disease.\nPatients whose heart failure has already been\ndiagnosed, who seem stable having conventional treat\u203a\nment but who might benefit from newer interven\u203a\ntions,17 also posed a dilemma; many clinicians were\nreluctant to initiate newer treatments that may have\nbeen around for decades, such as digoxin and\nspironolactone.16\nSuboptimal care often results from factors outside\nthe immediate control of the general practitioner.9\nLocal circumstances such as resource allocation,\npriorities, and attitudes of consultants are crucial. This\nstudy confirms that general practitioners perceived this\nto be the case for heart failure. The increasing involve\u203a\nment of primary care in planning local services\nthrough primary care trusts may alleviate this problem,\nproviding the trusts can work effectively with\nsecondary care providers.\nMethodological aspects\nThe qualitative method for this research lent itself well\nto discovering the barriers to optimal care. Rigour was\nenhanced by multiple coding and validation of\nrespondent validation.15 The personal and intellectual\nbias of the principal investigator was minimised by\nusing a co\u203amoderator in three groups, by allowing dis\u203a\ncussions to develop naturally, and by reporting the\nwide range of perspectives. Analysis of deviant cases\nenhanced the validity of the findings by bringing\nwidely accepted practice into question.14 Generalisabil\u203a\nity from qualitative research remains an issue with\nsome doctors. Guba and Lincoln have introduced the\nconcept of transferability as an alternative to generalis\u203a\nability.22 This implies that the onus is on the reader to\nevaluate the methods, setting, and results and decide if\nthese are transferable to their own situation. We believe\nthat the findings of this study can be transferred to\nmost settings in the United Kingdom.\nBarriers and overcoming them\nA dilemma is inherent in the management of heart\nfailure. Advances in science have outstripped the abil\u203a\nity and capacity of NHS delivery systems; rapidly\nchanging therapeutic paradigms have confused clini\u203a\ncians, sometimes because drugs previously regarded as\ndangerous, such as \u00e2 blockers, are new cornerstones,\nand others expelled from the arena, such as\nspironolactone, are back in vogue. Previous work has\nexplored general reasons why general practitioners do\nnot always implement best evidence.23 This study iden\u203a\ntified specific barriers that need to be overcome if\naiming for state of the art management. Particular fac\u203a\ntors needing attention are better and clearer infor\u203a\nmation, improved availability of tests and a useful\ntranslation of results from diagnostic methods, and\nexpedient access to specialist advice in case of doubt.\nStrategies to achieve these objectives might include the\ndevelopment of heart failure clinics and involving gen\u203a\neral practitioners and nurses with a specialist interest\nin an integrated care pathway. The national service\nframework emphasises that substandard care for heart\nfailure is unacceptable, and such new, conjoint\nstrategies are needed urgently.24\nWe thank the general practitioners who participated in the study\nand Jane Pryzborski for transcribing the tapes.
