ISSN \n0311-5518. \n \nThe co-occurrence of ammonites with palynomorphs in the Athol Formation of the \nTusk-1 and Tusk-2 wells drilled in the offshore Carnarvon Basin, Western Australia \nconfirms the Early Bajocian (Middle Jurassic) age of the Dissiliodinium caddaense \ndinoflagellate cyst Oppel Zone. The macrofaunas refine this Early Bajocian age to the \nearly Laeviuscula Chronozone. A belemnite from the Tusk-1 well has a strontium \nisotope (87Sr\/86Sr) ratio which is consistent with the biostratigraphical age. All the \nidentifiable ammonites belong to Pseudotoites robiginosus (Crick). Pseudotoites is \nprominent in the Early Bajocian of the Indo-Pacific Realm, being known mainly from \nonshore Western Australia and the Southern Andes, together with rare occurrences in \nIrian Jaya (west New Guinea); somewhat surprisingly, it is also rarely present in \nsouthern Alaska.

The wells were \ndrilled by Apache Northwest Pty Ltd, and the geographical coordinates are 20\u00b0 14\u2019 \n44\u2019\u2019; 116\u00b0 08\u2019 08\u2019\u2019 and 20\u00b0 14\u2019 16\u2019\u2019; 116\u00b0 08\u2019 18\u2019\u2019 respectively (Fig. 1). Ammonites \nare key tools for correlation of marine successions between continents. However, \nammonite specimens are rarely encountered from offshore wells in the Indian and \nPacific oceans. Here we report ammonites and palynomorph assemblages from eight \n  \n \n2\nsamples of the Athol Formation between 1206.60 m and 1165.16 m in Tusk-1, and \ntwo samples between 1194.45 m and 1193.41 m in Tusk-2 (Table 1). These biotas are \nindicative of an Early Bajocian (Middle Jurassic) age. This age has been corroborated \nusing strontium isotope stratigraphy on a sample at 1171.90-1171.80 m in the Tusk-1 \nwell. The ammonites allow the refinement of this age assessment to the early \nLaeviuscula Chronozone. \n \nAmmonites \nThe genus Pseudotoites. For the bibliographical references pertaining to the other \nammonite taxa mentioned, see Westermann (1969) and Westermann & Riccardi \n(1979). \nGeographical and stratigraphical distribution. \nWestermann & Riccardi (1979, p. 136) gave a comprehensive discussion of \nPseudotoites. The geographical distribution of this genus is exclusively Indo-circum-\nPacific (Arkell in Arkell & Playford 1954, Westermann 1964, 1969). The \nstratigraphical range of Pseudotoites approximates to the Early Bajocian Laeviuscula \nChronozone (Fig. 2). The nature of the Pseudotoites faunas in Western Australia, Irian \nJaya (west New Guinea), the Southern Andes and southern Alaska is described below. \n \nWestern Australia. The ammonite fauna of the Newmarracarra Limestone in the type \narea around Geraldton (northern Perth Basin) was monographed by Arkell in Arkell & \nPlayford (1954). This thin (11.4-3.3 m) unit contains endemic ammonite species and \nabundant shallow-water bivalves. Of the ammonite genera, Newmarracarroceras \n(formerly included in Fontannesia) and Pseudotoites are dominant, whereas the quasi-\ncosmopolitan Euhoploceras and Witchellia are rare. This Early Bajocian fauna was \nassigned to the \u201cSowerbyi Zone\u201d (= the Discites and Laeviuscula chronozones) by \nArkell in Arkell & Playford (1954), Arkell (1956) and Westermann & Riccardi \n(1979). However, Westermann & Wang (1988) refined this correlation to the \nLaeviuscula Chronozone, including the Ovalis Subchronozone (Fig. 2). \nThe variable level of preservation of most ammonites in the Newmarracarra \nLimestone makes the differentiation of species of Pseudotoites extremely difficult. \nMost specimens are partially crushed, with only either the outer or the inner whorls \npreserved. Furthermore, Arkell in Arkell & Playford (1954) was written at a time of \ntaxonomic splitting, with several species based on only single, imperfect specimens \nthat are now thought to represent extreme variants. The work of Arkell in Arkell & \nPlayford (1954) was revised by Westermann (1964), who significantly reduced the \nnumber of species and recognized sexual dimorphism. This simplified taxonomy was \nbased on study of the plastotypes, and has largely stood the test of time. \nThree ammonite morphogroups are distinguished from the Newmarracarra \nLimestone and these are listed below. The first two contain both macroconch and \nmicroconch allotypes. The valid species are listed below with subspecies or \nsynonyms, numbers of specimens examined (N), and diagnostic features. It is \nprobable that these three morphogroups each consist of a single dimorphic species, \nhowever more stratigraphical research is needed to solve this taxonomic problem. \n \n1. Platycones and sub-platycones from the upper part of the Newmarracarra \nLimestone \n \nMacroconchs (\u2640\/M): \n \n  \n \n3\nAmmonites (Perisphinctes) championensis Crick, 1894 (N = 4). The fine \nsecondaries disappear on the body-chamber. \nPseudotoites brunnschweileri Arkell, 1954 (N = 3). The secondaries are dense, \nand the diameter is small. \nPseudotoites fasciculatus Arkell, 1954 (N = 3-4). The secondaries are dense and \nprominent. \nStephanoceras leicharti Neumayr, 1885 (type species; N = 6-12). The \nmaximum diameter is >140 mm. \n \nMicroconchs (\u2642\/m) (= subgenus Latotoites Westermann, 1964; type species \nAmmonites australis Crick, 1894): \n \nAmmonites (Stephanoceras) australis Crick, 1894 (N = >2-3). The maximum \ndiameter is 85-90 mm. \nAmmonites (Sphaeroceras) semiornatus Crick, 1894 (N = >18). The maximum \ndiameter is 75 mm. \nPseudotoites spitiformis Arkell, 1954 (N = 1-2). The maximum diameter is 81 \nmm; stouter, more prominent tubercles and rursiradiate secondaries are present. \n \nNote that Ammonites semiornatus and Pseudotoites spitiformis were previously \nconsidered to be dwarf macroconchs (Arkell 1954, Westermann 1964, Westermann & \nRiccardi 1979). However, they are smaller than the largest Ammonites australis, an \nunequivocal microconch (Arkell, 1954, pl. 31, fig. 2). Ammonites semiornatus is the \nbest known form because of its abundance and good preservation. \n \n2. Sub-sphaerocones from the middle part of Newmarracarra Limestone \n \nMacroconchs (\u2640\/M): \n \nAmmonites (Perisphinctes) robiginosus Crick, 1894 (N = >20). The maximum \ndiameter is 160 mm. \nPseudotoites emiloides Arkell, 1954 (N = 12). The ribs and tubercles are sharp \nand dense. \n \nMicroconchs (\u2642\/m): \n \nAmmonites (Sphaeroceras) woodwardi Crick, 1894 (N = >12). \nOtoites antipodus Arkell, 1954 (N = >5). Coarse ribs and tubercles are present. \n \n3. Cadiconic \u201ccoronates\u201d \n \nMacroconchs (\u2640\/M) (microconchs and stratigraphical levels unknown): \n \nZemistephanus armatus Arkell, 1954 (N = 1). This specimen is extremely \nornate. \nZemistephanus corona Arkell, 1954 (N = 2). \n \nThe stratigraphical distribution of the ammonites in the Newmarracarra \nLimestone demonstrates that the dimorphic pair Ammonites (Perisphinctes) \nrobiginosus (\u2640\/M) - Ammonites (Sphaeroceras) woodwardi (\u2642\/m) (morphogroup 2) \n  \n \n4\noccurs mainly in the middle part of the unit (Playford in Arkell & Playford 1954, fig. \n2). Also, that the pair Stephanoceras leicharti (\u2640\/M) - Ammonites (Sphaeroceras) \nsemiornatus (\u2642\/m) (morphogroup 1) is confined to the upper part of the \nNewmarracarra Limestone (Playford in Arkell & Playford 1954, fig. 2). The \nstratigraphical position of the rare \u201cextreme coronates\u201d is unknown. \nThe age of Pseudotoites species is based on other occurrences, mainly in \nSouth America (see below), and on associated ammonites. The affinities and age of \nthe abundant Fontannesia clarkei Crick (including Fontannesia whitehousei Arkell), \nand of the rare Fontannesia fairbridgei Arkell were reviewed by Hall (1989). Hall \n(1989) placed both species in his new, endemic genus Newmarracarroceras, which is \nclosely related to the mainly European genus Fontannesia. Newmarracarroceras \nclarkei appears at the base of the Newmarracarra Limestone. Most Pseudotoites range \nup to the middle of the Pseudotoites gr. leicharti-semiornatus range zone (Playford \n1990). The age of the true Fontannesia is best known from Europe, where this genus \nranges from the uppermost Aalenian to the Lower Bajocian (Laeviuscula Standard \nZone; Ovalis Standard Subzone) (Cariou & Hantzpergue 1997). Hall (1989) noted the \nclose affinity between some southern European forms and the endemic Western \nAustralian forms. The endemic Euhoploceras playfordi Arkell also occurs throughout \nmost of the range of Pseudotoites. In Europe, the range of Euhoploceras is the \nConcavum and Discites Standard Zones (Aalenian-Bajocian). According to Hall \n(1989), however, the closest affinity is to the long-ranging Euhoploceras amosi \nWestermann & Riccardi from the Malarguensis-Singularis Standard Zones of west-\ncentral Argentina. This interval is equivalent to the upper Concavum\u2013lower \nLaeviuscula Standard Zones (Ovalis Standard Subzone) of Europe. Witchellia \naustralica Arkell, known only in a few specimens from the middle part of the \nformation (Playford in Arkell and Playford 1954), mitigates against a correlation with \nthe Laeviuscula Standard Zone. A similar Fontannesia sp. cf. F. clarkei-Witchellia \nassociation is also present in the Laeviuscula Standard Zone of southern Tibet \n(Playford in Arkell & Playford 1954, Westermann & Wang 1988). This supports the \ndating of the Western Australian Pseudotoites fauna as mainly early Laeviuscula \nStandard Zone by Hall (1989). \n \nIrian Jaya (west New Guinea). Pseudotoites cf. robiginosus (Crick) \u2640\/M (= \nStephanoceras cf. humphriesianum forma indica of Kruizinga 1926) and Pseudotoites \ncf. woodwardi (Crick) (= Visser & Hermes 1962, figs. 17, 18; fide Westermann & \nGetty 1970, table 1) are only known from ex situ collections, and therefore cannot be \ndated. \n \nSouthern Andes. The rich and extensively monographed Pseudotoites fauna of west-\ncentral Argentina ranges through the Singularis and lower Giebeli Standard Zones, \nSubmicrostoma Standard Subzone (Westermann & Riccardi 1979, p. 113, table 2; \nWestermann in Hillebrandt et al. 1992, table 12.2). This interval includes abundant \nrepresentatives of Pseudotoites spp., with Pseudotoites singularis (Gottsche) most \nabundant in the lowermost part, and Pseudotoites sphaeroceroides (Tornquist) in the \nuppermost part. The Singularis Standard Zone also yields abundant Euhoploceras \n(Fissilobiceras) spp., including the rare European index Euhoploceras ovalis \n(Quenstedt), latest Euhoploceras (Euhoploceras), early Sonninia (Papilliceras) and \nrare Sonninia alsatica (Haug). This fauna indicates a tentative correlation with the \nuppermost Discites Standard Zone and the Ovalis Standard Subzone of the \nLaeviuscula Standard Zone. The lower Giebeli Standard Zone, Microstoma Standard \n  \n \n5\nSubzone, yields early representatives of Emileia, together with Sonninia \n(Papilliceras). It is correlated with the upper Laeviuscula Standard Zone, \napproximately equivalent to the Trigonalis and Laeviuscula Standard Subzones \n(Cariou & Hantzpergue 1997, p. 43). This conclusion was reached mainly by \nstratigraphical interpolation. The upper Giebeli Standard Zone, Multiformis Standard \nSubzone, contains Emileia (Emileia) sp. aff. E. brochii (Sowerby), Emileia (Emileia) \nsp. cf. E. vagabunda Buckman and Stephanoceras (Skirroceras) spp. This is typical of \nthe European Propinquans Standard Zone (= \u201cSauzei Standard Zone\u201d). The \nPseudotoites range zone, therefore, is approximately coeval with the Laeviuscula \nStandard Zone (sensu lato). \n \nSouth Alaska. Rare endemic Pseudotoites occur in the upper Widebayense Standard \nZone, Sutneroides Standard Subzone, of the Alaskan Peninsula (Hall & Westermann \n1980). These are Pseudotoites kialagvikensis Westermann & Riccardi and \nPseudotoites prestoni Westermann. They are accompanied by the abundant endemic \nspecies Docidoceras (Pseudocidoceras) widebayense Westermann and Witchellia \nsutneroides Westermann. The former, abundant species, was originally assigned to \nPseudotoites by Arkell (1954, 1956), whereas unequivocal Pseudotoites were \nidentified in more recent collections from Wide Bay (Westermann 1969). This \nassemblage is superjacent to the Camachoi Standard Subzone, with Docidoceras \n(Pseudocidoceras) camachoi Westermann and Euhoploceras biifurcata Westermann, \nand was correlated with the Discites Chronozone by Hall & Westermann (1980). The \nSutneroides Assemblage Zone is therefore dated as early Laeviuscula Chronozone, \nOvalis Chronosubzone. Arkell (1954, 1956) also misidentified \u201cAmmonites\u201d \ncarlottensis Whiteaves and Zemistephanus McLearn from the Cook Inlet region of \nsouthern Alaska and the Queen Charlotte Islands of British Columbia as \nrepresentatives of the Western Australian Pseudotoites fauna. The endemic northeast \nPacific stephanoceratid genus Zemistephanus is present in the Kirschneri Standard \nZone (Westermann 1964, Hall & Westermann 1980). \n \nThe ammonite faunas from the Athol Formation of Tusk-1 and Tusk-2 wells \nSpecimens of the ammonite genus Pseudotoites Spath, 1929 were recovered from six \nsamples of the Athol Formation between 1205.60 m and 1165.16 m in Tusk-1, and \nbetween 1194.45 m and 1193.41 m in Tusk-2 (Table 1). The macroconchs (\u2640\/M) \nrecovered are large representatives of the Family Otoitidae Mascke, 1907 with \nprominent bullae or spines on the outer whorls. The inner whorls are almost \nplatyconic with fine, often blunt and prorsiradiate primaries, usually becoming \ndepressed at 30-40 mm diameter with cadiconic intermediate whorls. The body-\nchamber is rounded. \n All the figured ammonites in Figs. 3-5 are housed in the Commonwealth \nPalaeontological Collection (CPC) of Geoscience Australia (GA), Canberra, ACT \n2601, Australia. \n \n \nFamily Otoitidae Mascke, 1907 \nPseudotoites Spath, 1929 \n \nType species: Stephanoceras leicharti Neumayr, 1885. \n \nPseudotoites robiginosus (Crick, 1894) \u2640\/M (Figs 3A-B, 4) \n  \n \n6\n \n1894 Ammonites (Perisphinctes) robiginosus Crick, p. 483, pl. 12, figs 3a, b. \n1954 Pseudotoites robiginosus (Spath) Arkell, p. 547, pl. 34, figs. 1-4, pl. 35, figs 1, \n 2, pl. 37, figs 5, 6 (part). \n1954 Pseudotoites emilioides Arkell, pl. 24, fig. 5, pl. 37, figs 3, 4. \n \nMaterial. One adult macroconch from sample SC-21 (CPC 37056), internal \nmould, outer 1.25 whorls with half-whorl body-chamber, last three-quarter whorls \npreserved with left flank only (venter cut off by the drillbit), previous half-whorl \npartly crushed laterally. One fragment of intermediate whorls from sample SC-28 \n(CPC 37058), internal mould, well-preserved left side and venter. \n \nDescription. Intermediate whorls between 40 and 76 mm diameter (SC-28 \u2013 CPC \n37058), moderately evolute (umbilicus = 0.30 diameter) and strongly depressed, twice \nas high as wide. The innermost flank (umbilical slope) is smooth. Rectiradiate \nprimaries arise at mid-flank, are widely spaced (12 per half-whorl) and are moderately \nprominent. They end in small, somewhat bullate (longitudinally extended) tubercles \non subangular lateral edge at about 2\/5 the whorl height. Secondaries arise in threes or \nas single intercalatories; the cross is straight over the venter to about 60 mm diameter \nthen it begins to project, forming a shallow arch. \nThe outer whorl, between approximately 80 mm and the reconstructed \ndiameter of 140 mm at aperture (SC-21), is poorly known. The umbilical slope of the \nlower flank is steep to subvertical at the proximal end of the body-chamber. This \nwhorl is more coarsely sculptured than the intermediate whorls of SC-28, with about \n10 primaries per half-whorl that divide into more prominent bullate tubercles and into \nthree secondaries, without intercalatories. The body-chamber egresses at first \ngradually, then abruptly, towards the aperture, with flattening of the inner flank and \numbilical slope. The primaries combine with the tubercles to form extremely coarse \nbullae on the inner flank; the secondaries are unknown. \n \nDiscussion. The intermediate whorls of SC-28 are much more finely ornamented \nthan the outer whorl of SC-21, even at similar diameters (76-80 mm). Specimen SC-\n28 closely resembles var.\/subsp. emilioides, and specimen SC-21 is closer to the more \ncoarsely-ribbed typical P. robiginosus sensu stricto. \nThe var.\/ssp. emilioides macroconch closely resembles Pseudotoites \nsphaeroceroides (Tornquist) from the Andes (cf. Westermann & Riccardi 1979, pl. \n11, 12). It differs mainly in its more numerous secondaries and more distant \nprimaries. Significantly, the Andean microconch resembles the Australian \nmicroconchs \u201cAmmonites (Sphaeroceras)\u201d woodwardi Crick and \u201cOtoites\u201d antipodus \nArkell (see above and Arkell 1954, pl. 30). \n \nPseudotoites sp. indet. \u2640\/M (Figs 3C-E, 5A-B) \n \nMaterial. One macroconch from SC-35 (CPC 37063), and one septate whorl \nfrom SC-20 (CPC 37055); both are badly crushed and incomplete internal moulds that \ncannot be identified to species level. \n \nDiscussion. SC-35 (CPC 37063) is an adult macroconch with remnants of the \naperture at a reconstructed diameter of 130 mm. Only the right side of last third whorl \nof the body-chamber is preserved, it is ornamented only by distant, blunt tubercles. \n  \n \n7\nThe end of the penultimate whorl has similar ornamentation and remnants of dense, \nfaint secondaries. The intermediate whorls at ca 35-60 mm diameter have only about \n10 prominent, probably prorsiradiate (unless caused by compaction) primaries that \narise near the middle of the inner flank, and rapidly develop bullate tubercles. The \nsecondaries are dense and probably straight. Small parts of the innermost whorls are \nexposed in the umbilicus; they have smooth inner flanks, and oblique bullae on the \nlateral edges. \nSample SC-20 (CPC 37055) is a septate intermediate whorl of 85 mm \ndiameter, crushed so that the inner whorls have become acutely lenticular. The \nrectiradiate ornamentation consists of distant (ca 10 per half-whorl), short and blunt \nprimaries that form prominent bullae on the rounded lateral shoulder. It has four times \nas many, blunt dense secondaries; this is visible even on fragments of shell. This \nspecimen resembles SC-35. \n \nPalynology \nThe palynology of nine samples from the Athol Formation of the Tusk-1 and Tusk-2 \nwells was studied in order to place the assemblages biostratigraphically (Table 1). The \nseven samples from Tusk-1 and the two samples from Tusk-2 produced abundant and \nwell-preserved palynofloras. All palynomorph taxa mentioned at species level are \nlisted, with their respective author citations, in Appendix 1. The residues comprise \ncommon\/abundant wood and other plant tissues, but amorphous organic material is \nlargely absent. \nThe palynofloras include dinoflagellate cysts (mainly Dissiliodinium caddaense), \ngymnosperm pollen (dominantly Callialasporites spp.), and pteridophytic spores \n(largely Cyathidites spp.; Tables 2-4). The presence of abundant marine \nmicroplankton throughout indicates a consistent open-marine depositional setting. \nLikewise, the constant occurrence of abundant Dissiliodinium caddaense indicates \nthat the samples are all within the Dissiliodinium caddaense Oppel Zone of Helby et \nal. (1987). This species is extremely abundant, for example 762 and 653 specimens \nper microscope slide were counted in samples SC-22 and SC-31 respectively (Table \n2). Dissiliodinium caddaense is confined to this biozone, and its abundant presence \ncharacterises the middle part of the interval (Helby et al., 1987, fig. 15). The \nDissiliodinium caddaense Oppel Zone is of Early to \u201cmiddle\u201d Bajocian age according \nto Helby et al. (1987, fig. 46). The age of this zone was interpreted as Early Bajocian \n(Laeviuscula Chronozone), on the basis of the coeval ammonite faunas of the \nNewmarracarra Limestone of onshore Western Australia (e.g. Hall, 1989). This study \nconfirms that interpretation. The other dinoflagellate cysts such as Nannoceratopsis \ndeflandrei and Pareodinia halosa are entirely consistent with an Early Bajocian age \n(Helby et al. 1987). The pollen-spore floras are especially rich in Callialasporites \ndampieri and Callialasporites turbatus (Tables 3, 4). This favours a correlation to the \nCallialasporites turbatus Oppel Zone of Helby et al. (1987) which is of Toarcian to \nEarly Bajocian age. \n \nStrontium Isotope Stratigraphy \n \nAnalytical details. Fragments of SC23, a belemnite specimen from 1171.90-1171.80 \nm (Table 1) were hand-picked under a binocular microscope, and pre-leached in \ndouble quartz distilled dilute hydrochloric acid. A subsample of ~100 milligrams was \ndissolved in ultrapure 1M acetic acid and the strontium was separated by conventional \ncation exchange techniques using Biorad AG 50W-X8 resin. Isotope ratios were \n  \n \n8\ninitially measured on a Finnegan MAT 262, multicollector, mass spectrometer \noperated in dynamic mode with the strontium sample loaded on a tantalum filament \ntreated with phosphoric acid. A replicate analysis was made on a Finnegan MAT \nTriton operated in static mode with the strontium sample loaded on a rhenium \nfilament together with a tantalum oxide (TaO) activator following the method of \nBirck (1986). Thirty analyses of the international strontium isotope standard NBS 987 \nmeasured on the MAT 262 during the period of study yielded a mean 87Sr\/86Sr ratio of \n0.710249 \u00b1 0.000014 (2\uf073). The relevant mean value obtained for the NBS 987 on the \nTriton was 0.7102533 \u00b1 0.0000070 (2\uf073\uf020n=17). For consistency, the ratios measured \nfor SC23 are normalized relative to the accepted value of 0.710248 for NBS 987. \nReplicate determinations in this laboratory (n = 172) of a north Atlantic seawater \nstandard yield 0.7091752 \u00b1 0.0000098 (2\uf073). \nA preleached subsample was also taken for major and trace element analysis. \nShell fragments were leached in ultrapure 1M acetic acid for four hours. The leachate \nwas evaporated to dryness, and the residue taken up in 1% nitric acid. Geochemical \ndata were obtained by ICP-AES on a Fison\/ARL 3580 simultaneous\/sequential \nspectrometer with Gilson auto sampler. For stable isotope analysis, the equivalent of \n10 mg of carbonate was reacted with anhydrous phosphoric acid in vacuo overnight at \na constant 25\u00b0C. The CO2 liberated was separated from water vapour under vacuum \nand collected for analysis. Measurements were made on a VG Optima mass \nspectrometer. Overall analytical reproducibility for these samples is normally better \nthan 0.1\u2030 for \u03b413C and \u03b418O (2\uf073). Isotope values (\u03b413C, \u03b418O) are reported as per mil \n(\u2030) deviations of the isotopic ratios (13C\/12C, 18O\/16O) calculated to the VPDB scale \nusing a within-run laboratory standard calibrated against NBS standards. \n \nResults and interpretations. The palaeontological age of the succession studied in the \nTusk-1 well is corroborated by strontium isotope stratigraphy. The Sr isotope \nsignature of SC 23, measured on two separate instruments, yielded 87Sr\/86Sr ratios of \n0.707249 and 0.7072496, which are indistinguishable. They just overlap within the \nanalytical error of the lowest ratio measured by McArthur et al. (2000) for belemnites \nfrom the lowermost Standard Subzone of the Bajocian Stage (i.e. the Walkeri \nStandard Subzone, Discites Standard Zone) at Bearreraig, Isle of Syke, Scotland. The \n87Sr\/86Sr ratio of 0.7072496 indicates an Early Bajocian age on the LOWESS curve of \nMcArthur & Howarth (2004). Sample SC23 has low concentrations of Mn and Fe (1.9 \nmg\/kg and 9 mg\/kg respectively) and relatively high amounts of Mg (4147 mg\/kg) \nand Sr (1373 mg\/kg), which suggest pristine shell calcite (McArthur, 1994 and \nreferences therein). The stable isotope data (\u03b413C 2.4\u2030 and \u03b418O\u20130.7\u2030) are \nconsistent with marine signatures, and suggest that the material has not equilibrated \nwith meteoric water (Veizer et al., 1999), hence the Early Bajocian strontium isotope \nage is considered to be reliable. \n \nConclusions \nThe Athol Formation in the Tusk-1 and Tusk-2 wells, Western Australia, has yielded \nammonites and palynomorphs that indicate an Early Bajocian age. This age \nassessment was corroborated using strontium isotope stratigraphy. The ammonites, \nwhich are all referable to the typically Indo-circum-Pacific genus Pseudotoites, allow \nthe refinement of this determination to the early Laeviuscula Chronozone. \nThe palynomorph assemblages contain abundant specimens of the marine \ndinoflagellate cyst Dissiliodinium caddaense, and hence they are assigned to the \nDissiliodinium caddaense Oppel Zone of Helby et al. (1987), which is of Early \n  \n \n9\nBajocian age. This report confirms the dating of the Dissiliodinium caddaense Oppel \nZone and provides a valuable chronostratigraphic tie-point for the Western Australian \nJurassic succession. Helby et al. (1987, p. 25) stated that this zone is of Bajocian age \nbased on the work of Filatoff (1975, p. 7). Basically, Helby et al. (1987) used the \ndinoflagellate cyst content of the Cadda Formation and its lower and upper transitions \nas described by Filatoff (1975) to define their Dissiliodinium caddaense Oppel Zone. \nThis age determination is based on the Cadda Formation being partially coeval with \nthe Newmarracarra Limestone (Filatoff, 1975, fig. 2), which is of unequivocal Early \nBajocian age. The present study conclusively proves that representatives of \nPseudotoites, which correlate to the early Laeviuscula Chronozone co-occur with \ndinoflagellate cysts indicative of the Dissiliodinium caddaense Oppel Zone. \nFurthermore, it is clear that the Athol Formation is a correlative of the \nNewmarracarra Limestone of the onshore Perth Basin, Western Australia. The \npresence of extensive, well-developed Early Bajocian marine macrofaunas and \npalynomorphs in several Western Australian basins indicates an Early Bajocian phase \nof marine transgression onto the Australian block. This is consistent with a global \ntransgressive trend at this time (Haq et al. 1987), and the stratigraphically isolated \nnature of marine dinoflagellate cysts in the Early to \u201cmiddle\u201d Bajocian Dissiliodinium \ncaddaense Oppel Zone of Helby et al. (1987, figs. 15, 46). \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis contribution is part of a joint British Geological Survey (BGS) and Geoscience \nAustralia (GA) joint research initiative under the auspices of the Virtual Centre of \nEconomic Micropalaeontology and Palynology (VCEMP).
