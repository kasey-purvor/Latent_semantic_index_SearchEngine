Just The Future. \n \nAsh Amin and Nigel Thrift \n \nForthcoming Antipode 2005, Vol 37, Issue 2, March \n \n \nIntroduction \n \nEven now, it sometimes seems, there is a kind of nostalgia for the supposed days \nwhen the Left knew what was what and what it was about.  We do not share that \nnostalgia. Indeed, in many ways we not only like but respect the Left more now that it \nno longer feels the need to rely on just one account of how the world is or feels that it \nis necessary to strive for complete unity. Take the recent protests against the war in \nIraq that took place around the globe. If you were to zero in on the crowds of people \nmaking their way down the main thoroughfares of London or Washington or Paris or \na host of other places, at one scale of resolution you would see that the crowds gave \nout the appearance of unity but then at smaller scales of resolution you would see that \nthey were made up of all kinds of groups of protestors, each with their own reasons \nfor being there. Sometimes these reasons may have come from a grand analysis of \nAmerican imperialism but more often they were the result of a host of different \nmotivations including violated religious ideals or even just a vague sense of \nsomething not quite right.  \n \nWe see the Left in geography in a similar light. It is multiple right from the start. It is \nthe heir to many things. It is made up of many things. It is about many things. None of \nthis means that it cannot work as a together; but coming together - around concepts, \npercepts or affects - is not some natural state. It is an achievement, an achievement \nwhich has to be worked at and which constantly changes shape. In other words, what \nwe think the Left is about is a politics, an unending, always-changing politics. And \nthere is no anchor.  \n \nGiven this stance, you will not be surprised to find that this paper argues that the Left \nin geography is, so far as we can tell (and only history can really have a stab at that \nkind of judgement), in a pretty healthy state. Yes, it disagrees on lots of things \u2013 \nincluding what it is to be Left. So what? Just what else might we expect? Yes, there \nare some diehard Marxists, most notably in the US, who want to give Left geography \nmarks for revolutionary content: presumably 7\/10 in the 1960s and 1970s but only \n4\/10 now. How absurd. We see no crisis in Left geography.  What we see instead is \nthe continuing ebb and flow of events interacting with a certain notion of politics to \nproduce new formations which both intervene in the world and allow new thinking to \ntake place. We\u2019d quite like to know what else there is \u2013 and why this isn\u2019t enough. \n \nIn this paper, we therefore map a pluralist and forward-looking position whose \nguiding principle is the promotion of emergence through the process of disagreement. \nLet\u2019s be clear right from the start about what this means in terms of a Left \nnormativity.  We do not think that this has to mean dropping all values and throwing \naway every advance of the past.  Like many others, we believe that there are certain \nvalues that the Left has consistently held over a long period of time, none of which we \nwould dissent from.  First, a powerful sense of engagement with politics and the \n 1\npolitical.  Second, and following on, a consistent belief that there must be better ways \nof doing things than are currently found in the world.  Third, a necessary orientation \nto a critique of power and exploitation that both blight people\u2019s current lives and stop \nbetter ways of doing things from coming into existence.  Fourth, a constant and \nunremitting critical reflexivity towards our own practices: no one is allowed to claim \nthat they have the one and only answer or the one and only privileged vantage point. \nIndeed, to make such a claim is to become a part of the problem.   \n \nIn the recent past, the tradition of Left thinking and practice that most seemed to \ntypify the above four values was Marxism (already, it should be added, in its many \nforms).  However, it is difficult to see how this position can be maintained any longer, \nnot only because new approaches have been added to the repertoire of the Left, but \nalso because a series of re-workings of the world have taken place; re-workings that \nrequire new political strategies and new political imaginations. What was radical \npolitics in one time is not necessarily radical politics in another: both the meanings of \n\u2018radical\u2019 and \u2018politics\u2019 have changed. \n \nOne reaction to this state of affairs, admittedly a more and more muted one, has been \nto argue that adding different critical \u2018isms\u2019 to Marxism will suffice, but this is not \nwhat we have in mind. It is not an uncritical infilling of an unchanged unitary project \nthat the Left needs now, but something much more far reaching. There is no reason to \nbelieve that the Left needs to agree on everything - just think of the virulence of \ndebates in the 1920s and 1930s over topics as diverse as class or imperialism - and \nevery reason to believe that the strength of the Left will arise from learning from \ndisagreement (as it too often did not in the 1920s and 1930s). In other words, our \ndisagreements can provide the basis for connection. To make such a claim is not to \nespouse weakness or political quietism.  Rather, it is to suggest that political agonism \ncan have value in its own right, both tactically and normatively, and to assert that it is \npossible to think of a world in which we can live with and beside each other but not as \none. \n \nSuch a stance does not in any way entail \u2013 as is so often claimed by its critics on the \nLeft \u2013 an abandonment of long-held normative values such as equality, social justice, \necological responsibility, mutuality, and so on. What it does entail, however, is a \nsometimes painful realisation of how broad these values need to be if they are to build \na together without neutralizing difference. For us, the alternative is to hold to an \napproach which debars certain sensings of the world (and consequent recognitions \nand namings) and is therefore always in danger of not being able to see beyond its \nown backyard, an approach which we would take to be not only tactically but also \nethically problematic precisely because it bleeds out difference from the world.  \n \nAnd, of course, the nature of the world beyond the backyard has changed \ndramatically. Not as dramatically as some would argue, we are sure. We do not \nbelieve, as some commentators do, that we have transited to an entirely new political \nsituation in which the working class has been replaced by a multitude, simplicity has \nbeen replaced by complexity, and so on.  But it is to claim that business as usual is not \nan option.  So, for example, it makes no sense to simply produce a list of old problems \nand a list of old methods as the privileged terrain of the Left.  Equally, it makes no \nsense to assume that because one has produced a list of the ills of the world and \ndeclared them to be generally a bad thing, one is somehow automatically of the Left.  \n 2\nIt is clear that economic, social and cultural conditions and definitions are constantly \nchanging and that, equally, what is valued as politics and the political has no stable \nform.  For example, we cannot even be sure where prevalent models of democracy \narose from. In other words, the Left needs to learn to live with a degree of uncertainty \nwhich is more than just the tempering of particular principles by particular situations. \n \nIn this essay, we will enlarge on some of these issues by calling up three main lines of \nargument. In the first part of the essay, we will consider the question of theory. And it \nis a question. Theory is about building better questions which can reveal aspects of \nthe world that have hitherto been neglected or unimagined. Then, in the second part of \nthe essay, we turn to how practices of power have changed their character, mutating \nas new technologies become available and countervailing forces dream up new \nstrategies of resistance and dissent. The third part of the essay then considers the new \nfields of conflict that have opened up as a result and the different kinds of political \naction and notions of the political that they foretell. The essay\u2019s conclusions consist of \na brief geographical envoi in which in which we argue that Left geography is at a vital \nturning point after a time in which it has often led innovation in the discipline.  \nPerhaps it could return to some kind of originary purity, thereby claiming the mantle \nof Left canonical faith from the rest of the social sciences (which seem to have moved \non). Or, it can persist in setting the pace in the discipline as well as continuing to \ncontribute to Left theory and practice beyond, which will undoubtedly mean more \ntheory, more invention, more ambiguity, more experimentation - and more \ndisagreement. \n \nWorking Theory \n \nLet us start, then, with theory. One way of looking at the current situation is to see the \nproliferation of theoretical approaches as deeply threatening to core Left-wing theory, \nnotably Marxism of one kind or another. But that is not the way we see it.  For us this \nproliferation is an imaginative resource which can only strengthen our hold on how \npower is exercised and how discipline disciplines. Wonderful work has been done on \na whole range of topics, and through a whole range of conceptual positions, which \nseems to us to be fundamental in understanding what an equal and just society might \nconsist of.  And this work is not incidental \u2013 it is not a kind of footnote to the main \nproject - rather it is the Left\u2019s way of both changing its situation in response to new \nevents, institutions and capacities and imagining new trajectories which can assert \nverities that might otherwise be lost.  In other words, the world always consists of \nnecessarily incomplete thinking and bold yet hesitant practice, and theory, though it is \noften couched in abstract terms, is not necessarily far from the ground.   \n \nIn line with this imperative, theory has taken on a different style which has a lighter \ntouch than of old. For a start, few now believe that one theory can cover the world (or \nsave the world, for that matter).  No particular theoretical approach, even in \ncombination with others, can be used to gain a total grip on what\u2019s going on. Theory-\nmaking is a hybrid assemblage of testable propositions and probable explanations \nderived from sensings of the world, the world\u2019s persistent ways of talking back, and \nthe effort of abstraction (a word whose meaning is itself contested).  And as such an \nassemblage, it is always incomplete, always on the mend, and always shot through \nwith inconsistencies.  It is a perpetual effort, not a finished template.  This does not \nmake theory second best, as if it were merely evocative of the demonstrations that \n 3\nunderlie it. Rather, it provides important capabilities (many of them negative) which \ncan help to gain a purchase on what\u2019s happening.  \n \nMoving on, theory is more likely to be concerned with the desperate pressure for \nhappening \u2013 what comes next and next and next - which is neither history nor culture \nand with the kind of self-substantiating \u2018agency\u2019 that results, which is compelled by \nall manner of auto-reactive influences and by its own demonstrations. Then, theory is \nmore determinedly realist because it understands that so much of interaction imitates \ninteraction itself in its own articulation. In other words, there is a dimension of \nobjective reality that is too much its own thing ever to be framed as a mere \nconstruction and which can never be understood through the afterlife of mere \nreflexivity. That dimension is starting to be explored seriously, through an emphasis \non the lateralities of embodiment and affect, the vitalities of what might be called \nexpersonation, the growing technical envelope of being, and the sheer thisness of \nobjects. And, finally, the idea of explaining the social by means of the social seems an \nincreasingly bizarre reversion to a Durkheimian agenda in which social facts can be \ntreated as things, rather than that all things can be treated as society. In turn, taking \nsociety as the cause causes us to miss all kinds of things that are important. Take \ngender. Decades of feminist scholarship have come to understand that there is a \nwanting part of sexuality that has nothing to do with its social or biological definition, \nthe part that is never socialized and so energizes sociality instead.  \n \nGiven this brief preamble, it is no surprise that we do not propose to list the various \nstrands of new theory that have fed the Left\u2019s testing of living in recent years; theory \nthat challenges Euro-centrism, anthropomorphism, hetero-normativity, and \nspeciesism.  Rather, we want to note down just some of the foci of debate which have \nevolved, concerning the articulation of new practices and new imaginations, foci \nwhich have necessarily produced major theoretical effort.  \n \nLet us start with one of the most pressing of these foci, namely Euro-ethnocentrism.  \nA protracted and often painful effort has been made to give a constitutive place to \nother cultures and social groups, the results of which are still being worked through.  \nBut one result is clear: it is that it is no longer acceptable to think the world from the \nWest and its underlying Whiteness.  But more than this, this effort has involved a \nwholesale reperception of the world\u2019s history and geography - and its modes of \nthinking itself - as an interlocking set of interactions, rather than a bounded set of \nterritories, an insight which holds all the way from identity politics to the politics of \nimperialism.   \n \nA similar kind of point can be made about the push to rethink what is in the world, \noften under the guise of debates about materiality and\/or ontology (or, more \naccurately, given our position, ontogenesis).  Here, it has become clear that a whole \nseries of entities that have hitherto been neglected are centrally involved in powering \nup the world and themselves may have a kind of spectral political presence, not just as \nwitnesses to or disturbances of our endeavours but as mindful contagions producing \ntheir own articulations of sense and authority and brokenness and, indeed, essence. \nWe think here, for example, of work on animals, on material culture, on new kinds of \ninformational landscape working through screens and code, and so on. The central \npoint is that repairing this neglect has been an enormous theoretical challenge which, \njust like Euro-ethnocentrism, does not involve simply filling in gaps, but inevitably \n 4\nleads to new ways of thinking about thinking the world (as, for example, in an \nexpanded notion of what constitutes sexuality or generosity or compassion). So, for \nexample, there is a real political challenge in imagining our way into co-existing with \nother worldly responses and imperatives, such as those which might arise from \nparticular ecosystems and particular informational ecologies, which demonstrates that \nthe question is not so much whether something called the \u2018environment\u2019 will survive \nits various peoplings as whether these peoples will survive their own environing. \n \nMoving on again, what both these literatures have demonstrated is that what were \nconsidered to be stable moral and ethical positions have to be rethought.  It is simply \nnot possible, for example, to attribute \u2018agency\u2019 to other kinds of actor and retain a \nstay-at-home ethics.  An expanded ethics is required.  And this is not a trivial point in \na world in which violence is rife and forms of inhumanity seem to be multiplying, \nperhaps in part precisely because of fundamentalist moral templates which the Left \nitself may sometimes be closer to than it might wish to believe.  After all, at various \npoints in history, a certain Utopian impulse in Left thinking can be and has been too \neasily converted into an authoritarian reality.  At the very least, given this record, one \nwould think that a less impositional and anti-humanist stance might be thought to be \nnecessary, one which recognises that people constitute part of a green slime covering \none insignificant planet - and yet  does not lie down in the face of this fact.  \n \nAll of these challenges can be related to the analysis of capitalism, often thought to be \nthe bread and butter of what\u2019s Left.  What seems clear is that capitalist social relations \nhave certainly been bent and in some cases changed in very dramatic ways by a \ncontinual process of historical change, much of which is inevitably unpredictable - by \nclashes with highly differentiated labour organisations and consumer organisations, \nby new articulations with non-capitalist social formations, and by institutions of \nreflexivity which inform capitalist business practice. Our belief is that the internal \ndynamics of capitalism are increasingly likely to be interrupted by forces like these \nand by growing complexity, such that it becomes increasingly difficult to read off \ndeterminate outcomes.  This is not to say that capitalism does not exist or that it does \nnot have a core dynamic, but that the diversity of forms it takes has increased and has \nbecome more and more intertwined.  Thus, we are very wary of highly structured \nreadings of capitalism, replete with scales and driving logics.  Rather like the glossy \noutputs from global climate change simulations, they inspire a false sense of \nconfidence about the level and detail of knowledge about capitalism it is possible to \nhave. We believe that injecting uncertainty into the analysis of capitalism makes good \ntheoretical and practical sense, and moreover, is in line with one of the real powers of \nits objects, the ability to act rapidly and frugally in the face of disconcerting events.  It \nseems only sense to us, therefore, to allow many quite different theories of capitalism \nto flourish (from institutional and evolutionary economics to more modest \nexperiments in cultural economy as well as current obsessions with Spinozan \nimmanence).  This is because in a very real sense, they have much to say about the \ndifferent problems that different parts of the Left may face, and the different questions \nthat may be appropriate. \n \nFor Left geographers, these challenges inevitably extend into debates about the \nproduction of space and time.  Whatever the shade of opinion, it is difficult to find \ncommentators on the Left who do not believe that there has been some kind of shift in \nthe way in which space and time appear.  Furthermore, this shift is not innocent.  It \n 5\nhas political resonance. Whether one is writing about time-space compression, the \nlack of ability to cognitively map, new metaphors for thinking about spatial relations \n(e.g. fluids, fires, distanciation, and so on), new kinds of political space (e.g. \ndevelopments of the chora, public space, virtual democracy), or a simple change in \nthe background procedures of everyday life, it seems evident that something is going \non and that it can frame Left politics positively and negatively - for example, in terms \nof the speed of transmission of ideas and affect, in terms of the ability to associate \ntogether, in terms of the \u2018(a)whereness\u2019 of democracy, and in terms of how the space-\ntimes of the body are being redefined.  Each of these redefinitions produces new \nforms of power, both general and capillary, and new possibilities of government and \nresistance.  Instead of seeing each of these developments as mutually exclusive, it \nseems to us it would be far more productive to see them as different kinds of \ncontinental drift, joining together and detaching according to spatio-temporal \ncircumstance. \nWhich brings us to the final point we want to make in this section. What these \nchallenges add up to are powerful new geographies of organisation, belonging and \nattachment, which are literally redefining the spaces of what it is to be political.  We \ncan see this in the way in which unitary state government has changed into multiple \nlayers of governance with much increased connection between them.  The result is \nthat states have become more porous at certain scales while operating in lock-down at \nothers.  Indeed, some observers claim that international alliances between state \ndepartments (e.g. ministries of finance in the G8 or regulators of various kinds) have \nbecome more important than national states, forming a series of flexible government \nnetworks that rule different spaces and times of the world.  Of course, this is not \ndissimilar to what has been happening within multinational corporations, where \ninterfirm networks are often as significant as intra-firm hierarchies.  We are seeing the \nrise of a heterarchical order which increasingly constructs its power by both \nproducing and using diversity.  In these circumstances, an imperative for the Left, first \nof all, is to identify the varied sites and geographies of heterarchical power and not to \nshy away if that journey takes us in to unfamiliar territory.  A second imperative is to \naccept that the assault on instituted power must be selective and that a division of \npolitical labour is not a bad or contrary thing.  There is nothing that adds up in a way \nthat can be grasped through a singular politics of resistance.  \nA necessary corollary of this approach is that senses of political belonging and \nattachment are changing and that there is no one-size-fits-all adjustment to be made.  \nIn some parts of the world, persons are still mobilized around single issues and \nterritories.  But in so many others, subjects of all classes are made up of all kinds of \npolitical imperative and allegiance, each of which has to be called to in different \nways. This is not some kind of collage.  Rather, it is a rich warp and weft of different \nkinds of politics and political imperatives which are the subject of the next section.  \n \nOf course, the \u2018old\u2019 issues remain: industrial workers continue to die in accidents, \nwork remains under-paid, under-regulated and noxious in many parts of the world, \nstrikes are banned or severely curtailed, market models are inappropriately applied to \nsome forms of collective provision, we are probably at a high water mark of organised \nprostitution and crime (by some counts, there are more slaves in the world than during \nthe days of the Roman Empire), and many people around the world have no human \nand other social rights, whether these consist of the right not to be assaulted in their \n 6\nhomes or the right to walk down the street free of abuse or the right not to be falsely \nimprisoned.  The Left rightly concerns itself with these issues, and will continue to do \nso. It would be self-evidently absurd to argue against such concerns.   \n \nIn turn, however, it is important to understand the way in which power, exploitation \nand marginalisation construct new fields of influence and themselves react to new \nforms of counter-politics which are periodically invented.  The political sphere is \ncontinually being redefined and what might count as a democratic project twenty or \nthirty years ago must require updating as a matter or course if we are not to commit \nthe cardinal error of producing less worlds than we started from. It is not so much that \nwe believe that the political is or ever could be a static object or a single trajectory. \nThat much is surely obvious. Rather, it is that we believe that politics is multiple right \nfrom the start and therefore together must always be a temporary gathering.   \n \nNew Sites of Power and Exploitation \n \nLet us start, then, with sources of power that are making their way into the world.  \nThe first of these consists of the continual redefinition of what counts as private \nproperty.  That might mean new forms of recombinant industrial property as found in \nmany parts of Eastern Europe, it might mean bio-prospecting in Mexico, or it might \nmean the discovery of new genomes and proteomes in San Diego.  At the same time, \nthere is a slippage in what counts as intellectual property rights (witness the struggle \nover free music downloads) and  an on-going struggle over how long patents, licences \nand other property rights can be held (as in the struggle over anti retro-virals or over \nhow long copyright over books and films can be extended).  The Left must be \ninvolved in a continuous struggle to reassert the primacy of the commons, but \nrecognising that the territory of what constitutes property has not only immeasurably \nchanged but often involves very different kinds of material witness. This change \nthrows into very considerable doubt the validity of the claim in Marxism that the \nsimple abolition of private property is the big step that must be taken on the road to \nfreedom. \n \nSecond, the form which definitions of humanity take is also constantly shifting.  In \nsome areas of the world, certain persons are systematically excluded from citizenship, \nsometimes on entirely new bases (e.g. gene-based re-filiation, rights based on access \nto basics such as water or even the radio spectrum, or simply being born in excluded \nzones of the world, where even the right to bare life is questioned).  Increasingly, the \nworld seems to be under the grip of a new regime in which biopower is no longer an \nambition but has simply become a mundane reality and in which an apparently simple \n\u2018bare life\u2019 is increasingly filled almost to bursting with complex procedures of \ncontrol. This begs a new political ambition, but it also raises the very difficult \nquestion of how the struggles of those barely recognised as humans must link with \nother sections of humanity for whom lack is about other things such as access to the \ninternet or to emotional security and mutual recognition.  What is clear is that what \ncounts as the field of struggle for recognition has, at once, both expanded \nconsiderably as well as divided quite sharply, resulting in the negation of a singular \npolitics of belonging and citizenship.   \n \nThird, the forms which power takes constantly mutate.  So, for example, it is clear \nthat power is now being generated through the ability to initiate and track and \n 7\nmodulate flow in ways which are both more systematic and more invasive than in the \npast.  Whatever description is offered of this form of power \u2013 network, heterarchy, \ncomplexity, flow architecture, immanent forces, technostructure \u2013 the fact is that it \nallows careful placing of bodies and other objects to become a governmental art form \nat scales and in situations hitherto undreamt of (e.g. biometrics). Clearly all kinds of \nthreats arise from this development, from gross surveillance through new forms of \nembodiment and subjectivity that are slaved to the assumptions of these \nmanifestations of power, through to the danger that very large amounts of political \nthinking will be automated, through to the extreme difficulty, in some cases, of \nlocating the pinch points of power according to the traditional means of discovery that \nwe have become used to.  Following on from this, large corporate concerns have \nsimply become more skilled at working with international workforces and have \nproduced a hierarchy of flows of people, which has become a constant course of profit \nin its own right, all the way from gathering particular kinds of scientific expertise in \nelite locations, to the extensive use of illegal workers organised through hands-off \nsubcontracting networks.  One might argue that these developments have been taken \nup most avidly by governments.  Now that the division between government and the \ncorporate sector has been broken down by the agency of business schools, \nconsultancies, corporate lobbying, and the like, new arts of governmentality are \nrapidly becoming general, seducing too many forms of politics and organisation in \ncivil society too. \n \nFourth, these steps towards the comprehensive capillarisation of power are affecting \nthe nature of state power. At one level, states are conceding certain areas of traditional \ncontrol to new actors, but also, because of this, working at new forms of capture and \nco-habitation with these new actors.  So for example, it is no longer accurate to argue \nthat states and civil or economic organisations stand in opposition to each other, for \nall manner of state incursion into and collaboration with these organisations has \ngrown.  At another level, there can be no doubt \u2013 as we see from the reactions to \nterrorism, so-called rogue states and fundamentalisms of various sorts \u2013 that Western \nstate power, or more accurately Pax Americana, and its monopoly over the means of \nviolence has become more entrenched through all manner of acts, including violations \nof international rules of state conduct, capture by the US and its cronies of inter-state \ndiplomatic arenas, and state-driven attempts to legitimate global invasion, to re-draw \nwhat is morally acceptable in world affairs, to decide on who or what counts as \ncivilized.  The conduct and map of geo-politics has been thoroughly redrawn around a \ntightly centred but relatively fragile US imperialism in ways which are fiercely \ndebated precisely because their exact form and content is not known, even to their \nprogenitors.  \n \nFifth, though the Left has constantly pointed to the dominating power of the media in \ncontemporary life, still it needs underlining just how pervasive that power has become \nand how threatening to certain definitions of what constitutes a good life. We have \nbecome surrounded by constant reminders to consume, constant affective frames like \nmelodrama which too cosily locate the inequities of the world, and by short-cut \ncultures which have become skilled at quick and dirty mobilisations, including the \nredefinition of citizenship and social worth to suit corporate imperatives.  As \nimportantly, the concentration of media power is going on apace (as in the loss of \nlocally owned media outlets in the US) and is also bleeding into other forms of \nownership (as in the increasing links between print media and large information \n 8\ntechnology combines).  The result is that accounts of the world come from a \ndisturbingly few sources, whose imperative increasingly lacks much sense of the \npublic interest and indeed acts counter to it in the sense that certain topics (e.g. local \nworkplace politics) are not treated, whilst other topics are treated only in clich\u00e9d \nways.   \n \nSixth, runaway consumption in certain parts of the world clearly constitutes a problem \nof growing proportions, one which has still to find a convincing political language \nwhich chimes with people\u2019s everyday life.  Shoppers and shopping, especially in \nNorth America, have acquired an implicit economic power which is at the centre of \nglobalization.  Without these shoppers, it is possible to argue, the Chinese economy \nwould not be booming, together with many countries in South and South East Asia, \nthe world financial system would be in difficulty (since consumer demand translates \ninto demand for credit as well as all kinds of currency dealings and props), and many \ncorporations would collapse.  On the other hand, without these shoppers, we would \nalso have a slower rate of resource depletion, less damaging global climate change, \nand much attenuated energy demands.  It is clear that, underlying this dynamic, there \nis a set of ethical issues which are usually posed in much too grand a way for \nconsumers to grasp. As the work of many new consumption theorists shows, the \nworld of everyday goods is shot through with meanings and attachments, with senses \nof belonging and even love, which the Left is still struggling to grasp, except through \nmoralistic disapproval whose only effect is to make the Left feel good about itself.  \nWe are not arguing for uncritical acceptance of these new forms of affiliation, but at \nthe same time, it is patently absurd to reject the new consumerism from some \nOlympian height. \n  \nSeventh, though it is a hackneyed point, still it must be made again.  This is a world in \nwhich difference is itself a value and differential attachments have value in their own \nright.  It is fair to say that the Left has struggled to incorporate difference into its \nprojects, but now realises that that is not enough.  Current reworkings of Left politics \nhave come to understand the world as a patchwork of concerns, rather than as a single \nproject and have become open to learning from these concerns and indeed changing \nthe nature of political imperatives, not so much to accommodate as to welcome them.  \nThis reworking is important because forces of government themselves in some \ncountries increasingly work in this way, as we can see from recognitions of \nmulticulturalism, cosmopolitanism, and the rights of distant strangers.  It is possible to \nargue that the situation requires entirely new forms of political analysis.  For example, \nit has been argued that US electoral democracy has become entirely dysfunctional, in \nthat for most non-white working class citizens, political engagement now takes place \naperiodically around big or small affective firestorms which all cultural groups can \nopine over and feel some ownership of (e.g. the OJ Simpson affair or celebrated cases \nof attack on asylum seekers).  Such developments do not conform to standard \nmainstream and Left readings of political process and priority and yet they seem to us \nto be crucial while being unable to easily be contained within standard accounts of the \npolitics of difference.  Meanwhile, the ascendancy of Islam in large parts of the world \npoints to the implicit Eurocentrism of too much thinking in this area, supposing, as it \ndoes, that difference can necessarily be accommodated in a liberal democratic \nsettlement.  There are, in other words, major cultural cleavages that require political \nlanguages of the irreconcilable.   \n \n 9\nWe hope to have done enough to demonstrate that the sphere of the political \nconstantly changes as new directive events and processes take hold.  But there is one \nmore point to make, which is that all these changes act as a continual interrogation of \nhow the political itself should be framed.  This is not some arid theoretical point.  It \nlies at the heart of the ways in which the Left addresses the problems of the world.  In \na time when military extension of state power is more of a reality than for many years, \nwhen the romance as well as the grievance of terrorism is felt strongly by many, when \ndirect action in opposition to globalization has forged a different kind of spatial \npolitics, and when new political actors are routinely proliferating, it seems absurd to \nus to argue that all that is needed is more of the same from the Left.  What we really \nneed is more of the different, threaded together in loose coalitions which can respond \nas and where necessary.  In the final section, we want to outline some of the new \nforms of political action that can help us out of some of the current political logjams. \n \nOther Engagements \n \nIn the light of the above theoretical orientations, we can think of a number of new \nforms of political action which herald both the deployment of different political \nqualities (such as affect) and arenas (such as everyday life).  In each case, these forms \nof action are fostered by five principles which we believe that any active Left political \naction should cleave to. First, unlike some commentators, we do not believe in the \ncertainty of critique or an inevitable telos.  Some political actions are taken without \nthe full benefit of analysis, programme or certainty of outcome, and yet may well \nhave important consequences for a politics of struggle and emancipation. The \nprinciple we wish to defend is that of democratic experimentalism.   \n \nSecond, we do not believe in the romance of pulling down the whole system, whether \nthat be capitalism, the state, or some other monstrous entity.  This would be to assume \nthat such total systems exist, puts too much weight on a kind of Manicheanism and \nshort-circuits numerous other kinds of political action which come to be regarded as \nsecondary or ephemeral.  As importantly, there is some evidence to suggest that such \na politics of the total ends up as a kind of authoritarianism that mirrors the objects of \nits critique.  The principle we wish to defend is that of a transversal politics that is \nconstantly worked at, that accumulates new political concerns as new events unfold \nand that, through such accretion, builds a whole that is more than the sum of its parts - \nbut does not sum up.   \n \nThird, we believe in the constitutive power of disagreement. We do not believe in \nagonistic politics for its own sake, but equally, we do not believe that it is necessary to \ncome to agreement in order to sanction action.  This would be a denial of the principle \nof the political itself, so far as we are concerned, as formative ground and sphere of \nbecoming. Of course, this does not deny the importance of making attachments, \nforging connections, or setting up alliances.  Indeed, one might argue that this is \nprecisely the work of the political.  A Left which instead chose purity, in our opinion, \nwould no longer be doing politics, but would instead be involved in a project of what \none might call authoritarian consolation.   \n \nFourth, it follows that we believe that the world is an open political horizon.  At any \npoint, there are least worse options which can make a difference.  Whether we frame \nthis as the politics of hope, as a politics of mundane transcendence, or even as a \n 10\npolitics of immanence, it seems to us to be vital to hold on to an optimism about the \nworld as perhaps the constitutive element of Left politics.  This means that the Left \ncan once and for all leave behind a certain kind of conservatism in which it is \nautomatically against anything new on the grounds that it has been borne out of the \nmalign forces of capitalism or that it has all been accounted for in a previous \nmanifestation.   \n \nFifth, it follows that we believe that political action can take place at all kinds of \nscales, and that there is no necessary need to make a distinction between little and \nlarge politics.  In the annals of Left struggle, it is not clear to us that producing clean \nwater for a village in Ethiopia is somehow less important than producing a world \npolitical manifesto.  Acts of freedom are many, varied, and often require just as much \nwork of alliance and political nuance at one scale as they do at another.  The Left \ncannot afford to believe that it has privileged oversight. \n \nIn mapping out some new forms of politics, we are not intending to be exhaustive, nor \nare we trying to diminish the significance of enduring forms of struggle \u2013 in the \nworkplace, in the domestic sphere, in the public arena, within all manner of \ncommunities, organizations and institutions, even over and for life itself.  Rather, we \nwant to illustrate some of the ways in which Left politics can be extended and, or at \nleast so we would argue, strengthened.  Returning to the seven theoretical orientations \nwe have mapped out above, we can point to some of the forms of political action \nwhich are now able to become part of a Left political repertoire.  Once again, we want \nto stress that these are borne out of the problems faced by activists and theoreticians \ntogether in thinking through particular events.  They should not be seen as a part of \nsome overarching political toolkit, but rather as the result of making new realities out \nof experimenting with the world in new ways.   \n  \nWe can begin, then, with new forms of property.  Here, we can think of a whole series \nof political actions such as those which have been associated with asserting \nindigenous people\u2019s rights to knowledge and resources, forms of action which have \ntried to assert common ownership of copyright, and attempts to produce cheap drugs \nin the face of corporate super-profits.  More generally, as we saw from the example of \nrecombinant property in East Europe, we can point to experiments with hybrid \nownership forms that fall short of public ownership but yield considerable social \nbenefits (e.g. copyLeft, worker participation, stake-holder rights).  Similarly, there \nhave been interesting experiments in both North and South with cooperatives, new \nforms of associative economic organisation which emphasise mutuality, and a range \nof initiatives which attempt to harness the wealth of pension funds to wider social \nends.  The point about all of these developments is that, though many of them \nnecessarily fail, gradually the Left is learning what works, and, as importantly, from a \nchoice of existing experiments which offer varying social outcomes.   \n \nSecond, we can point to the politics taking place around new forms of humanity and \nvitality more generally.  For example, there are attempts to produce various forms of \nenvironmental justice, attempts to rebase cities so that animals and other sentient \nbeings are included as partners in suffering and hope, attempts to produce a politics of \ngenetic injustice against hopefully residual eugenic impulses (such as fighting \ninsurance company redefinitions of common risk), all kinds of struggles around \n\u2018disability\u2019, and so on.  As importantly, these struggles are yielding forms of \n 11\nproducing knowledge which are highly cooperative and fundamentally positional. For \nexample, the production of scientific knowledge can be pushed in particular directions \nthat work against the grain, producing conjoint knowledges of various kinds (such as \nthe involvement of sufferers in cures for aids, or the role that patients have played in \ndemocratising the search for cures for muscular dystrophy in France) that may have \npowerful political resonances.  \n \nThird, there is no doubt of the need for a politics of informational liberty in the face of \nnew forms of network power which rely on constantly mutating information to exist.  \nSuch politics range all the way from simple attempts to assert freedom of information, \nthrough more complex attempts to foresee the likely impacts of continuous tracking \ntechnologies like GPS and RFIDs.  Similarly, there are all those political struggles \nwhich aim to insert interrupts into global networks of flow, so as to allow those who \nare being shuttled around the world to have some choice over their trajectory (e.g. \nwork with illegal workers and asylum seekers, forms of citizenship that allow \nintermittent habitation and rights of mobility, attempts to formulate a basic right of \nmovement for poorer people who are otherwise excluded from most of the social \nnetworks that others take for granted in societies where friends and kin are \nincreasingly spread).  Then, there are all the attempts to show up the mundane world \nof flows, and by showing it up, to produce new political possibilities, from attempts to \nformulate a socialised politics of software through to attempts to resist the workings \nof state power by tackling iconic objects (e.g. artistic mockeries of the security \nindustry or many of the artistic attempts to work with showing the basic structure of \nthe web).  Finally, of course, there are all the travails of the anti-globalization \nmovement, seeking to forge alliances and commons across differentiated webs of \nmutuality.  What is interesting of late is the degree to which irony and absurdity are \nbeing added to the armoury of these protestors, for example, in attacks on \nmanagement speak, audit culture, and the pompous extravagances of G8 and Davos.   \n \nFourth, the anti-globalisation movement has come to show that an alternative \ngeopolitics based on shifting and heterogeneous solidarities across the world, gathered \naround significant events such as the meetings of the World Social Forum, can have \nconsiderable political purchase.  This is a politics of resistance based on small projects \nand loose alliances, some of which are entirely tactical.  The absence of telos or \ncoherence is not necessarily a weakness.  The gains have been considerable, in \noutlining a possible alternative world to corporatism, in cementing a culture of \ntransversal solidarity across the human and ecological landscape, in rattling the \ncertitude and arrogance of the neo-liberal and US-centred elite, and in imagining new \ngeographies of affect, obligation and commitment to distant others.  Of course, there \nis a danger in over-romanticizing this movement, but its potential as a counter-weight \nto the leviathan of new state-driven global geo-political reconfigurations should not \nbe underestimated. \n \nFifth, the Left has always understood the importance of the media, whether in the \nform of agit prop or particular design styles, at least in part because artists have been \nsuch a vital cog in the machine of dissemination of ideas and protest.  It is no surprise, \nthen, that the media constitute one of the most vibrant areas of Left politics, especially \ngiven the conjuncture between old traditions and new media.  One of the most \nexciting developments has been the growth of various kinds of web and discussion \nsite which have allowed all kinds of exotic political discourse to flourish, precisely at \n 12\na time of apparent closure in mainstream media.  However, the real political issue is \nnot whether the Left can talk to itself (important though that is), but whether it is \npossible to find forms and outlets which can talk to more general populations and in a \nsustained way.  Here, the importance of a representational and non-representational \npolitics of affect becomes clear.  It is necessary to think through the different ways in \nwhich political content is freighted with affect and the various sensory registers in \nwhich this varied content makes its mark and holds interest.  So, for example, a new \nperformative counter-politics is appearing in an attempt to allay the fears of asylum \nseekers generated by the mass media.   \n \nSixth, the politics of consumption continues to be an enormous challenge to the Left.  \nOne issue is how to frame environmental imperatives in ways which relate to people\u2019s \neveryday lives, as in recent attempts to politicize cleanliness.  How is it possible to at \nonce to ensure that the needs of those who have very little can be met whilst curtailing \nthe extravagances of the well-off?  These issues of frugality and redistribution have to \nbe sieved through networks of use and practice built up over many years, networks \nwhose rightness is very often felt in the guts. A parallel issue is the attempt to produce \na politics of the geography of environment and consumption, through both practical \ninitiatives like fair trade, farmers\u2019 markets, slow food and other forms of ethical \nconsumption and media-savvy initiatives which attempt to reconnect everyday items \nlike food with their origins in far away places.  Another area is the politics which \nattempts to attack consumers\u2019 love for objects such as cars, through semiotic \ndeconstructions which use the full force of savage irony, humour and embarrassment \nin order to tear the car away from consumer heartstrings.  Then, there is a politics \nwhich attempts to work with the affirmative nature of many elements of consumer \nobjects, for example, their status as gifts which trace out networks of friendship and \nkinship, and through these networks redefine what are acceptable exchanges, thereby \nhitting at the concept of value itself as it is understood in the minutiae of everyday \nlife.   \n \nSeventh, and perhaps most developed, there is the cauldron of identity politics.  The \nabiding lesson that the Left has learnt over the last 20 years has been its provincial \ncharacter, and the need to displace that character if a global politics is ever to become \npossible.  There are many possibilities for a non-parochial politics which can make \npeoples broad instead of confining them by finding spaces for opening up to the \nsurprise of combination.  We can point to three illustrative examples.  One is the large \nnumber of performance-related events which mobilise particular kinds of identity, \noften in powerful ways, but which are also often able to act as a knowing critique of \nprecisely this social form (e.g. the affirmations of ethnic and sexual identity that have \ncome from street theatre). Another is the ways in which Left politics has attempted to \nmanipulate spaces of various kind in order to show how identity is politically \nconstructed, from the important work on border identities and border politics being \ncarried out in places as diverse as Mexico and Indonesia, to the work on \ndecolonisation and cultural mixture in state spaces such as Ireland, through to \nattempts to frame diaspora in all its varied geographies.  Such work on hybrid \npolitical spaces seems to us to be exemplary in helping the Left to construct a global \ndemocratic politics that is not constrained by the forcings of class, territory and \nethnicity.  The last example, closely connected to the other two, is concerned with the \npolitics of memory.  Here, one can point to rich cases around the world which seek to \n 13\nwitness the past in novel ways, so that different emotional attachments can be forged \nand different hopes can be generated.   \n \nConclusions \n \nIt would be difficult to deny the difficult days that the world is going through.  One \nmight say that the four horseman of the apocalypse have moved from a quiet trot to a \nfull gallop and this increase in activity has been accompanied by the rise of right wing \npolitics of various kinds which are clearly associated with a series of state and \ncorporate ideologies and practices that must be denied any more room in the world \nand that, in time, must be rolled back.  But, we also think that it is possible to be too \npessimistic if boundaries are drawn too narrowly around what constitutes the political \nand Left politics. \n \nIn contrast, in this essay, we have argued for a broader understanding of what is to be \nstruggled over assembled through a broad coalition of often conflicting political \ninterests. We believe that a politics of working through inevitably difficult coalitions \nholds out the possibility of learning, precisely because that diversity can provide real \nand evolving strength in depth, arising out of the continual rebirth such a stance \ndemands.  In other words, we are arguing for something closer to an ecology of hope \nthan to a political machine, an ecology of hope which is constantly adapting to \ncircumstance as it tries to reproduce itself, an ecology that can teach ourselves to them \nand in so doing reach a kind of escape velocity.   \n \nAnd Left Geography? \n \nAnd, finally, what does all this mean for Left geography?  So far as we are concerned, \nit means moving on.  Let\u2019s agree to disagree and get on to the politics. So, first of all, \nno more policing. Throughout our time in geography, there have been those who have \nwanted to police the Left, who have wanted to keep it as a kind of club, complete with \nrote declarations of intent and the like. We are not interested in being members of this \nclub or in the periodic set-piece shoot-outs that are meant to keep it pure: it is our \nworld too and we are not going to apologize for seeing it in a different way. A gate-\nkeeper politics will only serve the critics of the Left in and beyond our discipline, and \nmight well be regarded as irresponsible in the face of the plethora of issues currently \nvyingforpoliticalattention.  \nBut, secondly, in rejecting policing, we do not wish to defend an undifferentiated \npluralism \u2013 a kind of free-for-all Left politics which is nothing more than an agonized \nliberalism. There are real differences of situation and perspective in the world which \ngo far beyond framing forms of accusatory culture, and they matter in terms of what it \nis possible to say and do about the world and its ways.  However, given that very \nimportant caveat, we would go so far as to argue that a clear divide is emerging within \nLeft geography between, for want of a better word, a hierarchical, enclave Left that \nsees system, deep structure and normative purity everywhere it looks, and a \nheterarchical Left that perceives a flatter world of multiple orderings and non-linear \nconnections that calls for constantly re-negotiated tactics.  No doubt the table below, \nwhich attempts to capture some of these differences, will be hotly disputed by those \non both sides of the divide as well as others who might wish to be named differently.  \nBut our purpose is not to pigeonhole. It is simply to illustrate how far we think that \nthings have changed in Left geography.   \n 14\n \n \nHierarchical Left Heterarchical Left \nOptic Orientation Orientation  Optic\nPurism Systematic promiscuity \nStructure Instituted practices \nCapitalism \nas system \n Morals Ethics \nCapitalist \norderings \nGoal-driven Agonistic learning \nBeing  Becoming \nWorld to \nbe \nuncovered Prescription Innovation \nWorld to \nbe made \nCertitude Experiment \nUtopian spaces Spaces of hope  \nSpace as \nknown \nScale Space \nSpace as \nmade \n \nThirdly, moving on in geography means amplifying the imperative to connect. It is no \ngood drawing lines and boundaries around a world which continually overflows them \nand around a politics which needs to evolve in order to keep pace with that \noverflowing.  This must mean not only imagining the world in multiple ways but also, \nand particularly important for a discipline which is nowhere near as interdisciplinary \nas it fondly thinks, a willingness to engage with heterodox thinking drawn from all \nmanner of disciplines.  If there ever was just one geographical tradition, that tradition \nhas now exploded, and it would surely be presumptuous for the Left in geography to \nthink that it knows it all or that what is Left elsewhere is not Left. \n \nFinally, then, moving on must mean feeling that there is a vibrant Left project in \ngeography which we should feel privileged to be part of, a project which forms a rich \nmap of territories and networks of concepts, percepts and affects that constitute the \nmain resource within which we think, from which we draw inspiration and which we \nall have a responsibility to nurture with new ideas and practices.  The Left is a living \ntradition, with many ways of summoning life.  It is time that the Left in geography \ncame to accept this vibrant pluralism, instead of insisting that certain perspectives \nnecessarily hold a privileged insight into the ways of the world. There is just too much \ngoing on in the world to need to close things down in this way, and every reason to \nbelieve that many of the prospects for better societies will come from the excitement \nof learning this anew.   \n \n \n 15\n"}
