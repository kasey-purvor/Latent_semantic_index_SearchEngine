Current interventions are often poorly\ndefined, lack explicit hypotheses about why or how they might work, and have insufficient evidence about\neffectiveness. This project will identify (i) the \u2018key ingredients\u2019 of an effective intervention to increase participation\nin physical play and leisure in children with motor impairments; and (ii) how these ingredients can be combined in\na feasible and acceptable intervention.\nMethods\/Design: The project draws on the WHO International Classification of Functioning, Disability and\nHealth and the UK Medical Research Council guidance for developing \u2018complex interventions\u2019. There will be five\nsteps: 1) identifying biomedical, personal and environmental factors proposed to predict children\u2019s participation\nin physical play and leisure; 2) developing an explicit model of the key predictors; 3) selecting intervention\nstrategies to target the predictors, and specifying the pathways to change; 4) operationalising the strategies in a\nfeasible and acceptable intervention; and 5) modelling the intervention processes and outcomes within single\ncases.\nDiscussion: The primary output from this project will be a detailed protocol for an intervention. The intervention,\nif subsequently found to be effective, will support children with motor difficulties to attain life-long well-being and\nparticipation in society. The project will also be an exemplar of methodology for a systematic development of non-\ndrug interventions for children.\nBackground\nParticipation, including engagement in physical play and\nleisure, is fundamentally important to children\u2019s healthy\ndevelopment. It enables them to develop the social and\nphysical competencies required to flourish, and provides\nsocial-emotional well-being, sense of meaning, and pur-\npose in life [1]. Children with motor impairments (e.g.\ndifficulties with motor control, muscle tone or balance)\nexperience significantly reduced participation in leisure\nin general [2] and in physical play and leisure specifically\n[3]. These children constitute 6-9% of the population\nunder 16 years of age [4] and are at life-long high risk of\nhealth and social difficulties [5,6]. Interventions in early\nlife that effectively promote participation in physical play\nand leisure could provide considerable lifetime gains for\nchildren and their families, and, through preventing ill\nhealth, could bring cost savings to the health service and\nsociety more broadly.\nCurrent interventions for children with motor impair-\nments are so-called \u2018therapeutic activities\u2019 (e.g. games and\nexercises) recommended by occupational therapists and\nphysiotherapists. The interventions are provided by thera-\npists, parents and\/or teachers in a variety of community\nsettings (e.g. clinics, schools, homes). The interventions aim\nto increase what the children can do, including the range\nand quality of their pursuits and play. Most current inter-\nventions are believed to work through neurological, physio-\nlogical and cognitive pathways that are thought to reduce\n* Correspondence: n.kolehmainen@abdn.ac.uk\n1Health Services Research Unit, University of Aberdeen 3rd floor, Health\nSciences Building, Foresterhill, Aberdeen, AB25 2ZD, UK\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nKolehmainen et al.

There is little high-qual-\nity research concerning most of these interventions and\nlittle empirical evidence to support their effectiveness [7-9].\nResearch in chronic pain [10] and stroke [11] has\nshown that behavioural interventions can be used to\nincrease what an individual can do as well as what they\nactually do in real life. The approach involves supporting\npeople to change behaviour using techniques that change\nbeliefs (i.e. perceptions, expectations, etc) or behavioural\nregulation related to that behaviour. An example is using\nself-monitoring (a behaviour change technique) to\nincrease a child\u2019s confidence (a belief about capability) in\nplaying ball games (a behaviour). Some of these techni-\nques are implicit in current treatment approaches, but\nmany interventions do not systematically incorporate\nsuch techniques or draw on evidence and theory related\nto behaviour change.\nCurrent therapeutic and behaviour change interventions\ncan be described as \u2018complex interventions\u2019; that is, they\nconsist multiple independent and interdependent compo-\nnents. The UK Medical Research Council (MRC) frame-\nwork [12,13] provides guidance for how \u2018complex\u2019 (i.e.\nmultifaceted) interventions should be developed and eval-\nuated, highlighting in particular the issues that should be\naddressed as part of the intervention development. Specifi-\ncally, the framework recommends: establishing evidence\n(about the problem and possible solutions), identifying or\ndeveloping a testable theoretical model (of the problem\nand the solutions) and modelling the pathways through\nwhich the intervention is hypothesised to influence the out-\ncome. These aspects can be addressed through cycles of\niterative and summative work. Few current interventions\nto improve children\u2019s participation in physical play and lei-\nsure have been developed in this systematic way. The\nmodels about how they may affect the outcomes are lim-\nited and, to our knowledge, there has been no empirical\nmodelling of the possible causal pathways.\nThe present project will use the MRC guidance [12,13]\nand an integrated therapeutic-behavioural approach\n(described below) to develop a multifaceted theory- and\nevidence-based intervention to increase what children can\ndo and what they actually do in terms of physical play and\nleisure.\nThe theoretical framework: an integrated therapeutic-\nbehavioural approach\nIt is widely acknowledged that the traditional biomedical\nmodel of illness does not sufficiently explain illness and\nhealth, particularly in children with motor impairments, as\ntheir health and quality of life are related to multiple\nfactors [14]. The WHO developed the International Classi-\nfication of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) frame-\nwork [15] that incorporates biological, individual and\nsocial perspectives as components of illness and health.\nThe core components of the ICF are impairment (of bod-\nily structure or function), activity and activity limitations\n(i.e. what one \u2018can do\u2019 or cannot do in a standardised\nenvironment) and participation and participation restric-\ntions (i.e. what one \u2018actually does\u2019 in real life situations).\nThe ICF has been used widely in research and practice in\nrelation to chronic conditions, and there is an adapted ver-\nsion of the ICF for Children and Youth (ICF-CY [15]). The\napplication of ICF to children with motor impairments\nand a physical play\/leisure (ball games) is illustrated in\nFigure 1.\nIn children with disabilities, the factors explaining varia-\ntion in participation are likely to include: impairment (e.g.\nreduced strength, pain); [16,17] activity limitations (e.g.\ndifficulties in catching and throwing); [18] personal factors\n(e.g. the child\u2019s preferences, emotions and motivation);\n[18] and environmental factors (e.g. the parents\u2019 prefer-\nences and behaviour, the parents\u2019 and school\u2019s perceptions\nof the child\u2019s problems, and the child\u2019s region of residence)\n[17-19]. \u2018Health condition\u2019 (e.g. cerebral palsy) is unlikely\nFigure 1 An illustrative application of the ICF: children with motor impairments and playing ball games.\nKolehmainen et al. BMC Pediatrics 2011, 11:100\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2431\/11\/100\nPage 2 of 8\nto explain significant variation in participation [20]. The\nrelevance of the different factors in predicting participa-\ntion is likely to depend on the nature of the pursuit or\nplay [16,17]. Without rigorous research, it is unclear how\nthe predictors relate to children\u2019s participation in physical\nplay and leisure.\nIn improving participation, empirical evidence [10,11]\nhas shown that the application of ICF components can be\nsignificantly strengthened by conceptualising activity and\nparticipation as behaviour, and subsequently integrating\nbeliefs and behavioural regulation strategies related to the\nbehaviour into the \u2018personal factors\u2019 component of the\nICF. For example, a child\u2019s confidence (\u2018a belief about cap-\nability\u2019 [21]) in catching and in playing ball games with\nothers is likely to influence whether the child can catch a\nball (a behaviour) and whether the child actually plays ball\ngames with others (a behaviour). For children with motor\nimpairments, intervening to change behaviour has been\nfound to be more effective than intervening to change\nimpairments [22].\nThere is thus a strong argument for using an integrated\ntherapeutic-behavioural approach [23] to develop inter-\nventions aimed at increasing children\u2019s participation. This\napproach provides an interdisciplinary, evidence-based\nconceptual framework for identifying potential predictors\nof children\u2019s participation, and provides a way of making\nexplicit the currently implicit theories behind many non-\ndrug interventions for children with participation\nproblems.\nMethods\/Design\nThe overall methodology is based on the MRC guidance\n[12,13] for developing and evaluating complex interven-\ntions. The focus will be on the \u2018developing the interven-\ntion\u2019 phase, operationalised similarly to previous studies\n[e.g. [24]] (Table 1) as five main steps:\n1) identify (a) biomedical, (b) personal and (c) envir-\nonmental factors proposed to predict children\u2019s par-\nticipation in physical play and leisure;\n2) develop an explicit model of the key predictors of\nparticipation;\n3) select (a) therapeutic and (b) behaviour change\nstrategies to target the proposed predictors, and spe-\ncify the pathways through which the strategies are\nhypothesised to change participation;\n4) operationalise the strategies in a feasible and\nacceptable intervention; and\n5) model the intervention processes and outcomes\nwithin single cases.\nThe primary outcome will be children\u2019s participation\nintensity (i.e. frequency divided by number of pursuits).\nThe outcome has been specified [25] in terms of its target\n(the child), action (participation in physical play and lei-\nsure), context (the child\u2019s life outside school curriculum)\nand time (the past four months). The study has been\napproved by the North of Scotland Research Ethics Com-\nmittee 1.\nPopulation\nChildren with motor impairments and participation\nrestrictions referred to occupational therapy or phy-\nsiotherapy will be approached. Inclusion criteria will be:\n(i) presence of at least one problem in body structure\nor function (e.g. muscle tone, body awareness) as identi-\nfied by a paediatrician or a therapist; (ii) can mobilise\nindependently (with or without aids); (iii) aged 6-8\nyears.\nThe age criterion was selected as the research team\u2019s\nexperience suggests that children in this age range\nengage in pursuits and play that are sufficiently similar\nfor them to be targeted using the same intervention;\nand because there is a valid and reliable outcome mea-\nsure for these children\u2019s participation [26]. There will be\nno criteria for diagnosis or cognitive level; descriptive\ndata about these characteristics will be collected and\nincluded in the analysis as independent variables. The\ninclusion criteria regarding age and cognitive level may\nbe adjusted as further evidence emerges.\nTable 1 Steps used to operationalise the MRC framework and their application in this work\nSteps in previous work24 Steps and research questions in this work\n1: Identify mediators of change 1a-c: What are the likely predictors (e.g. impairments, beliefs) of physical play and leisure that could\nbe targeted to increase children\u2019s activity and participation?\n2: Select (or develop) a theoretical model 2: How do the proposed predictors relate to each other and to activity limitations and participation\nrestrictions in physical play\/leisure?\n3: Select intervention techniques and specify\npathways to change\n3a-b: What intervention components (i.e. \u2018therapeutic activities\u2019 and behaviour change techniques)\ncould be used to target the proposed predictors, and what are the hypothesised pathways from\nthese strategies to participation?\n4: Operationalise the intervention 4: How can the intervention components best be operationalised so that the intervention is\nacceptable (to children, parents and professionals) and feasible?\n5: Conduct a modelling experiment 5: Which of the intervention components are most likely to have an effect on the outcome(s), and\nwhat are the interactions between the components?\nKolehmainen et al.

The sample will consist of chil-\ndren from six therapy services within NHS Scotland and\nEngland. Data about participation will be collected by\ntherapists at first appointment in the occupational therapy\nor physiotherapy service using CAPE [26] (physical pur-\nsuits only), a child-friendly, interviewer-administered\nquestionnaire.\nData about impairments and activity limitations will be\ncollected from therapists\u2019 routine observations of the child\n(e.g. standardised assessments, clinical observations) at the\ninitial assessment. Therapists will be asked to provide their\nobservations alongside the child\u2019s participation data. The\ndata will subsequently be coded using the ICF-CY [15].\nMultiple regression will be used to identify the impair-\nments most strongly related to limitations in activity and\nparticipation in physical play and leisure.\nThe target sample size is approximately 280 children.\nThis is determined by a combination of requirements of\nthe multiple regression analysis and feasibility. The regres-\nsion analysis will include approximately 29 independent\nvariables related to impairment (e.g. motor organisation\nand planning, tactile functions, mobility of joints), environ-\nment (e.g. beliefs about the child\u2019s health condition; [27]\nand beliefs about consequences of, capabilities in, and\nsocial influences [21] regarding participation in the target\npursuit or play - see step 1c for details about data collec-\ntion) and the child\u2019s personal factors (e.g. age, health con-\nditions). Taking the larger of 104 + m or 50 + 8*m (where\nm is the number of independent variables) [28] indicates\nthat a minimum sample size required will be 282 children.\nIn terms of feasibility, it should be possible to collect data\nfrom 288 children in 4 months based on the following\nassumptions: involve 5 NHS occupational therapy and\nphysiotherapy services; conservatively estimate 15 thera-\npists per service; [29] with 60% of therapists agreeing to\ncollect data; [30] each therapist seeing on average 2 new\nchildren a month [29] who meet the inclusion criteria; and\n80% of parents [30] and children agreeing to anonymised\ndata collection.\nStep 1b: Identify children\u2019s beliefs about participation in\nphysical play and leisure\n\u2018Child-friendly interviews\u2019 will be conducted with a sub-\nsample of children participating in step 1a. All children\nwilling to participate will be included, with a target sample\nsize of 25. Techniques similar to those used in other inter-\nview studies [31,32] with young children (age 4+) with\nhealth problems will be adopted. This will involve \u2018map-\nping\u2019 with visual-grids [33] and include the use of creative\ntechniques such as representations of various participation\ncontexts, picture prompts, free drawing and a character\nthat the child can associate with. The techniques will be\nused to encourage the child to construct stories about par-\nticipation in physical play and leisure. The children will be\nactive participants in the \u2018story\u2019 construction, with the idea\nthat this will allow them to project their experiences and\nbeliefs in a non-intrusive, child-led manner. The techni-\nques will require minimal motor skills and the children\nwill be free to choose techniques that they wish to use.\nThe interactions will be recorded and transcribed, and\nanalysed using the framework approach, [34] with the\nintegrated ICF as the coding framework.\nStep 1c: Identify parents\u2019 beliefs about their children\u2019s\nparticipation in physical play and leisure\nA survey of parents of children participating in step 1a\nwill be conducted. This will build on the existing evi-\ndence and mapping of this evidence onto psychological\ntheories about health-related behaviour (e.g. the Com-\nmon Sense Self-regulation Model [27,35]). A question-\nnaire, similar to those commonly applied in behavioural\nstudies, will be used to investigate parents\u2019 beliefs about\ntheir child\u2019s problems and their child\u2019s participation in\nphysical play and leisure. A multiple regression analysis\nwill be used to investigate relationships with the parents\u2019\nbeliefs and their child\u2019s participation.\nStep 2: Develop an explicit conceptual model of the key\npredictors of participation\nEvidence from 1a-c will be synthesised with existing evi-\ndence and theory to develop a further, more specific\nmodel. This will include specifying the proposed predic-\ntors (e.g. \u2018motor control\u2019 in impairments; \u2018confidence\u2019 in\nchild\u2019s beliefs; and \u2018consequences of the child\u2019s condi-\ntion\u2019 in parents\u2019 beliefs) and the hypothesised pathways\nbetween each of the proposed predictors and children\u2019s\nactivity and participation.\nStep 3a: Select \u2018therapeutic strategies\u2019 for targeting the\nproposed predictors\nA focus group will be held with 7-8 senior occupational\ntherapists and physiotherapists, identified through pro-\nfessional specialist interest networks. Therapists will dis-\ncuss and classify intervention components extracted\nfrom current practice- and literature-based treatment\nmanuals according to whether or not they would be\nused to target the specific predictors. Therapists will be\nasked to suggest any additional strategies not included\nin the existing list, and to discuss the assumptions\nunderlying the hypothesised relationships between the\nvarious strategies and the predictors.\nKolehmainen et al. BMC Pediatrics 2011, 11:100\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2431\/11\/100\nPage 4 of 8\nStep 3b: Identify behaviour change strategies for targeting\nthe proposed predictors\nSpecific strategies will be identified from the matrix of\nbehaviour change techniques [36] that recommends which\ntechniques should be used for a given predictor. Each\ntechnique will be specified using the taxonomy of beha-\nviour change techniques [37] (or a more recent taxonomy\nif available) and the relationships between the techniques\nand the predictors will be specified using the theoretical\nunderpinnings related to each technique.\nStep 4: Operationalise the intervention strategies in a\nfeasible and acceptable intervention\nThe intervention strategies will be operationalised and\ntheir mode, context and frequency of delivery specified\nthrough consultation with therapists, experts in behaviour\nchange (members of the Aberdeen Health Psychology\nGroup), children and parents. Advice on the frequency\nand intensity with which the different strategies should be\ndelivered will be sought from the therapists and behaviour\nchange experts. Advice on acceptable and feasible modes,\ncontexts and frequencies of delivery will be sought from\nthe children, parents and therapists.\nSteps 3 and 4 will culminate in an intervention manual\nthat carefully specifies the population likely to benefit\nfrom the intervention (including age, impairments, perso-\nnal and environmental dimensions), as well as the inter-\nvention content, frequency and intensity, and mode and\ncontext of delivery. This will involve further investigating\ndifferent outcome measures, including self-report (e.g.\nCAPE, [26]. Canadian Occupational Performance Measure\n[38]) and objective measures (e.g. accelerometers), and\ndeveloping a rigorous yet feasible protocol for outcome\nmeasurement.\nStep 5: Model the intervention processes and outcomes\nwithin single cases\nThree experimental single case studies, using a mixed\nmethods approach, will be used to: pilot the intervention\nprotocol; explore effects of the intervention and its com-\nponents within a child; and further explore the acceptabil-\nity of the intervention to children, parents and therapists.\nThe design will allow exploration of any aspects of inter-\nvention delivery where there is more than one obvious\noption (e.g. to explore the most feasible mode and context\nof intervention delivery). Single patient interrupted time\nseries design, [39] that is repeated measures at baseline\nand follow-up, will be used to estimate intervention effects\nand potential biases in these estimates. Semi-structured\ninterviews with children (using similar methods to those\nused in step 1), their parents and therapists will be used to\nexplore acceptability. Quantitative data will be analysed\nusing an appropriate time series statistical method (e.g.\ntime series regression) and qualitative data using a frame-\nwork analysis [34]. At the end of step 5, revisions to the\nprotocol will be made, resulting in a final intervention pro-\ntocol ready for a formal effectiveness study (e.g. rando-\nmised controlled trial).\nEthical considerations\nThe current understanding of childhood suggests that\nchildren both actively generate their own worlds [40]\nand are influenced by their environment [41]. This\nincludes an understanding that different children experi-\nence the world differently [42]. There is also an appre-\nciation that children have rights, two of which are of\nspecific importance when considering research with\nchildren: (1) a right to make a contribution, and (2) a\nright to be safe from harm.\nThe intervention that will be designed during this pro-\ngramme of work is aimed to be of benefit to children\nwith motor impairments. For this to succeed, it will be\nessential to gain knowledge of these children\u2019s views and\nperceptions about participation in physical play and lei-\nsure. Involving the children themselves helps to maxi-\nmise the likelihood that the intervention will address the\nright issues and be relevant and acceptable to children\nwith whom it will be used. In research involving children,\nspecial considerations need to be given to ethical (and\nrelated scientific) issues. These are in addition to the\nusual ethical and scientific considerations required. To\nacknowledge this, we have agreed upon principles that\nwe will used to guide the conduct of this project. These\nare, in brief:\n\u25a0 children will be respected and appreciated as\nimportant contributors without whom the project\nwould have limited meaning;\n\u25a0 active steps will be taken in designing and con-\nducting the research to ensure that children will be\nempowered to participate on their own terms,\nincluding expressing views on the ways in which\nthey wish or do not wish to contribute;\n\u25a0 as part of empowering children, research methods\nthat are \u2018child-friendly\u2019 and \u2018in-tune\u2019 with children\u2019s\nways of experiencing the world will be used; and\n\u25a0 good relationships and trust will be proactively\nbuilt with both the children and their carers, to\nreduce any anxiety or worry about the children\u2019s\nparticipation.\nOne aspect of implementing these principles will be\nan involvement of a child advisory group in conducting\nthe project. The group consists of five children with\nmotor impairments, aged 4-9 years (ages at the start of\nthe study). The study has research ethics governance\napproval (ref: 11\/S0801\/2 with further application to be\nsubmitted for step 5).\nKolehmainen et al. BMC Pediatrics 2011, 11:100\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2431\/11\/100\nPage 5 of 8\nDiscussion\nThe project described here will develop an intervention\nto increase participation in physical play and leisure in\nchildren with motor impairments. The main output will\nbe an intervention manual that is based on empirical evi-\ndence and on a theoretical model of disability as beha-\nviour, and is clearly defined, feasible for use in practice\nand acceptable to children, families and professionals. If\nthe intervention is found to be effective in a subsequent\nformal evaluation, the intervention will support children\nwith motor difficulties in attaining life-long well-being\nand participation in society.\nThe findings will have high relevance for children with\nmotor impairments, their families, and for therapists\nworking with them. Evidence about the likely predictors of\nparticipation in physical play (step 1) will provide guidance\nto parents and therapists about the key factors to consider\nwhen assessing children\u2019s participation. The hypotheses\nabout the mechanisms through which the predictors may\nrelate to the outcome (step 2), will support therapists to\ndevelop evidence-based hypotheses for practice about how\nthe interventions they use and recommend may have an\neffect. In combination, steps 1 and 2 will thus allow\nfamilies and therapists to make more informed decisions\nabout where to focus their resources at assessment (i.e.\nwhich factors to assess) and intervention (i.e. which factors\nto target).\nThe specification of the intervention strategies and their\nrelationships to intervention targets (step 3) will improve\nclarity of current intervention techniques and their pro-\nposed pathways of change. This will allow therapists to\ndescribe explicitly their interventions, and the rationale\nunderpinning them. The results will also provide thera-\npists guidance about the issues related to acceptability of\ninterventions from children\u2019s and parents\u2019 point of view\n(step 4).\nThe project will also have impact for theory and\nresearch in children\u2019s participation. The project will\ninvestigate children\u2019s participation within a therapeutic-\nbehavioural theoretical framework, and explicitly draw\non the two bodies of literature and evidence in develop-\ning the intervention. To date, these two approaches rarely\nhave been applied together systematically within one\nstudy. Yet, activity and participation are major outcomes\nfor both approaches and it is plausible that the two\napproaches are complementary. Specifically, it may be\nthat the therapeutic approach will be particularly useful\nfor investigating the \u2018body structure\/function-activity-\nparticipation\u2019 pathway; the behavioural for investigating\nthe \u2018personal factors-activity-participation\u2019 pathway; and\nthe two in combination for investigating the \u2018environ-\nment-activity-participation\u2019 pathway. Combining these\ntwo approaches to develop one intervention may allow\nactivity and participation to be targeted through several\npathways simultaneously, and thus maximise the effec-\ntiveness and efficiency of such an intervention. The pro-\nject presented here will provide evidence about the\nbenefits and challenges related to integrating the two\napproaches in developing interventions aimed at activity\nand participation.\nFinally, the methods described will be an example for\nfuture work in developing clearly specified non-drug\nrehabilitation interventions; and the model of participa-\ntion in physical play and leisure (step 2), along with the\nclear specification of the different intervention techni-\nques (steps 3), will provide theoretical and empirical\nbases for evaluation of the causal mechanisms underpin-\nning interventions targeted at children\u2019s participation.\nAcknowledgements and funding\nThe authors would like to thank the clinical advisors (Ms Heather Angilley\nfrom Mid-Yorkshire NHS Trust and Ms Michelle LaBarre from NHS Lothian);\nthe academic advisors (Professor Marie Johnston from University of\nAberdeen, Professor Allan Colver from University of Newcastle and Professor\nStuart Logan from Peninsula Medical School); the child advisors (five\nchildren aged 4-9 years from Fife, Scotland); and the parent advisor for their\ninvaluable contribution.
