Introduction \nMicrofluidics technology that has the potential to stimulate \nthe integration of silicon based sensors, electronics, and \nfluidic functions for biochemical analysis within portable \nminiaturized bio-fluidic instruments. The market sectors of \nspecific interest include medical diagnostics, industrial \ncontrol, environmental monitoring and pharmacology. \nExamples are DNA extraction from blood, detection of \npathogens, e.g. genetically modified organisms (GMO\u2019s) \nor allergens and the replacement of animal testing.  In most \ncases, the value of this work is derived from the ability to \ngenerate enhanced measurements from extremely small \nsamples (few ml) at low cost. \nThe use of microfluidics in molecular biology has already \nbeen shown to offer benefits such as improved sensitivity \nand speed of analysis. An example here is a charge based \ncapacitive biosensor for bacteria growth monitoring \n(BGM) presented in [1]. The sensor chip is implemented in \na CMOS process in order to show the applicability of the \nproposed on-chip capacitive technique for BGM purposes. \nAnother example is an integrated microfluidic-fibre optic \ndevice for the detection of agglutination for blood type \ncross-matching proposed and described by [2]. The device \nconsists of a straight microfluidic channel through which a \nreacted red blood cell suspension flows through a syringe \npump based actuation system.  \nIn general, although there are a number of extremely \ninteresting technologies capable of integrating \nmicrofluidics with electronic control and processing [3], \nfew commercial implementations exist. Accelerating the \nuptake of these technologies is hence a core mission of \nnumerous private and public funding bodies. Solutions for \ndefining efficient non-destructive production test strategies, \nfault tolerant design features and integrated health \nmonitoring are expected to be important contributions \ntowards this goal [4].  \nIn the field of microsystems, embedded test is now \nacknowledged to be a crucial requirement within the design \nspace of MEMS-based solutions [5]. Within this work, \ntestability has been shown to be especially important \nwithin the design flow for microfluidic systems and their \nbiological applications due to the immaturity of the field \nand limited understanding of the sources of failure. There \nhas also been work on the testing process for the \ninterconnect infrastructure of microfluidic chips [6]. Here \nmechanical and fluidic testing apparatus and protocols for \ncharacterizing both chip-to-chip and world-to-chip \ninterconnects have been proposed.  \nThe idea of Oscillation-Based-Test (OBT) for analogue \nintegrated circuits was initially presented in [7] where the \ncircuit under test is converted to a circuit that oscillates at a \nfrequency that is a function of the material properties and \nstructural integrity of the system. Faults in the circuit under \ntest can be detected which normally cause a deviation of \nthe oscillation frequency from its nominal value. The \nvalidity of this technique was verified through examples \nsuch as operational amplifiers and analogue-to-digital \nconverters. OBT has also been evaluated within      \nMEMS-based systems through work on a monolithic \nmagnetometer [8]. The natural frequency of the cantilever \nhas been chosen to be the main input parameter to the test \nstrategy. The tolerance band and detection range in the \ncase of small deviations applied to technological process \nparameters have been assessed. The potential for using \nOBT in a DNA sensor array has been discussed in [9] and \n[10] as well where the modes of sensing and test can both \nbe realised in an oscillator-based structure. The idea of \nmonitoring power supply current (IDDQ) has been applied to \nan electro-fluidic interface in a FlowFET system [11] \nwhere the system under test is fundamentally electronic but \napplied within a microfluidic environment. Bridging faults \nwithin this FlowFET system have been shown to be \nefficiently detected using this method. A functional test for \na continuous FlowFET has also been demonstrated in [11]. \nThe underlying principle is that typical faults, such as \nPaper 22.2                                   INTERNATIONAL TEST CONFERENCE                                       2 \n                            \n                                                    \ndegraded gate voltages, jammed particles in the channel or \nleakage will influence the fluid velocity and the duration of \nfluid charging.  \nFor digital droplet-based microfluidic systems, techniques \nfor defect classification, test planning, and test resource \noptimization have been presented in [12], whilst in [13] \nboth catastrophic and parametric faults have been detected \nby electro-statically controlling and tracking the motion of \ntest droplets. The detection of these test droplets is through \na simple RC oscillator formed by a pair of driving \nelectrodes with the fluid between them acting as the \ndielectric. Furthermore, based on the test results, the 2-D \nEWOD (Electro-Wetting On Dielectric) arrays with open \nstructures can be reconfigured in order to reallocate \nresources and avoid using the sites marked faulty. A \nconcurrent testing method is also presented in [14], which \nallows fault detection and biomedical assays to run \nsimultaneously on a microfluidic system. \nAnother method based on Euler paths is proposed in [15], \nwhich maps a digital microfluidic biochip to an undirected \ngraph where a test droplet is routed along the Euler path \nderived from the graph to pass through all the cells in the \narray. In [16] a droplet routing technique on a digital \nmicrofluidic device is proposed to ensure fault-tolerant \nbehavior. Three typical faults are built into fault models for \nthis device. This method gave efficient solutions to \nproblems like optimal routing, run-time fault diagnosis, \nand subsequent fault recovery.  \nThe dependability has also improved by using digital \nmicrofluidic logic gates. In [17, 18] fault diagnosis \nmethods to locate a single defective cell and multiple \nrows\/columns with defective cells in a digital microfluidic \narray have been presented. These methods utilize digital \nmicrofluidic (exclusive-OR\/AND) gates to implement an \noutput comparator. An efficient testing and diagnosis \nmethodology for digital microfluidic biochips has also \nbeen proposed in [19]. This method is based on a \npartitioning technique that increases parallelism in testing \nand diagnosis by exploiting the available sources and sinks \nwhich supports the ability to detect and locate single as \nwell as multiple faults in a microfluidic array. An excellent \nsurvey of research on design automation and test \ntechniques for digital microfluidic biochips can be found in \n[20].  \nThe work carried out here is motivated by characterisation \nstudies that have revealed that sensor electrode degradation \ntends to be a key reliability issue in cell-based biosensors \nand that correction is not possible through manual cleaning \n[3,4]. Degraded electrodes tend to exhibit much lower \nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or higher interface impedance \nthat in both cases degrades the ability of the system to \nmonitor cellular signals and bio-chemical processes. Both \nthe quality of the sensing interface and the integrity of the \nbio-chemistry are crucial to the performance and reliability \nof the system. Monitoring key parameters or reliability \nindicators for these component parts in addition to the \ntransportation and processing functions is hence an \nessential feature of future systems. This work complements \nthe international effort to advance the field of embedded \ntest for microfluidic systems and builds on initial work on \nboth an MEA (Micro-Electrode Array) structure and full \nbio-diagnostic system presented in [21,22].  \nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 \nbriefly describes and references the case study and an \nelectrical model at the circuit-level for the electrolyte-\nelectrode interface which has been developed and \ncharacterised based on the theoretical analysis of micro-\nelectrodes in [23]. In section 3, theoretical consideration of \na mid-frequency oscillation test solution to monitor the \nsurface quality of micro-electrodes is presented, which \ndepends on the sensitivity of the bio-fluidic interface \ncapacitance to degradation, contamination and fouling. To \nverify this technique, experiments on an MEA were carried \nout, the results of which are documented in section 4. \nFinally, conclusions are drawn in section 5. \n2. Self Test Solution and Fault Modeling \nDesign-for-test, fault detection and fault diagnosis have \nbecome essential for many technologies to increase \ndependability and enhance safety and reliability. For \nmicrofluidic systems, faults and measurement errors are \noften indistinguishable and hence the need to move from \ntest strategies that generate deterministic pass\/fail data to \non-line condition monitoring techniques that generate \nindicators of evolving faults or conditions that may \ninvalidate a measurement. \nIn using electrodes to sense either spontaneously generated \nextracellular potentials or to measure the impedance of \ntarget cells, the reliability indicator will be related to the \nfundamental signal coupling between the ion flow in the \nelectrolyte and the electrode interface. Therefore, the \nelectrical properties of the electrode-electrolyte interface \nare crucial parameters within fault-free and faulty systems. \nAnalysis has however indicated that degradation of the \nsensing interface and the health status of bio-chemical \nspecies are not trivial parameters to monitor.  \nTo help understand the dependence of system performance \non such physical defects, an electrical equivalent model \nmay be used. An electrical model at the circuit-level for the \ninterface has been developed and characterised in [21,22] \nwhich is based on the theoretical analysis of micro-\nelectrodes in [23]. This model is shown in Figure 1, where \nCEDL is the capacitance of the Electrical Double Layer, RCT \nthe charge transfer resistance, ZW the Warburg impedance \ndue to ion diffusion, ZP the impedance of the porous \nsurface, RS the electrolyte spreading resistance and CX is \nthe parasitic capacitance. The model that has been \ndeveloped for the electrode-electrolyte interface has been \ncharacterised on an MEA platform as illustrated in Figure \n2 [24]. \nPaper 22.2                                   INTERNATIONAL TEST CONFERENCE                                       3 \n                            \n                                                    \nC\nEDL\nR\nCT\nZ\nW\nR\nS\nZ\nP\nC\nX\n \nFigure 1    Circuit model for the electrode-electrolyte \ninterface \nThis is a well-accepted interface for recording the \nextracellular potentials from neuron networks or cardiac \ntissues [25]. The MEA has 60 sensing electrodes \ndistributed on a square area of 0.6 x 0.6 mm2 with the \ndistance between neighbouring electrodes being 200 \u00b5m. \nEach sensing electrode has a diameter of 30 \u00b5m and is \nfabricated using high surface porosity material (TiN). The \nelectrolyte used has a molar concentration of 120 mM. \n \nFigure 2 Sensing electrodes site of the MEA (Reproduced \nfrom [24]) \n \nThe values of the components in the interface model have \nbeen calculated (Table 1) with good agreement between \nsimulations and experimental results. \nTable 1: Calculated values of components in the interface \nmodel \nComponent Value \nCEDL 125 pF \nRCT 3 M\u2126 \nZW (1\u2500j)0.39 \/ f  \nZP (1\u2500j)5e6 \/ f  \nRS 7 K\u2126 \nCX 2.5 pF \n \nFor electrodes used within MEAs for recording \nextracellular signals from neuron networks or cardiac \ntissues, there are three potential mechanisms that can result \nin quality degradation of micro-electrodes according to the \nend-users. They are: \n\u2022 electrode degradation due to damage during the \ncleaning and preparation of the MEAs, \n\u2022 fouling of the electrodes by biological material that is \nnot removed completely during cleaning, and \n\u2022 material loss of the electrode surface through ion loss \ninto the surrounding liquid medium. \nAll of these affect the electrode-electrolyte interface in the \nform of either physical damage, fouling from biological \nmaterial deposits, or loss of solid material from the \nelectrode surface. As the porous layer is located on top of \nthe micro-electrodes and interfaced with the operational \nenvironment, it is logical to assume that the fault \nmechanism active will degrade the performance of the \nsystem through damage to the porous layer to some degree. \n3. Oscillation-Based Technique (OBT) \n3.1 Surface Degradation and the Electrical \nDouble Layer (EDL) \nThe model presented in Figure 1 has been shown to be \nuseful for exploring the effect of surface degradation of the \nbio-electrodes under study. In many implementations of \nelectrodes and electrode arrays, the value of CEDL is a \nfunction of both expected biological processes (e.g. \nhybridisation) and degradation mechanisms such as \nfouling, contamination or electrolysis due to voltage bias. \nThe electrode surface was made from high porosity \nmaterial to increase the effect of the EDL. It is hence \nlogical to expect that all relevant types of degradation that \nwill affect the electrode structure will directly impact this \nlayer. Figure 3 shows two different examples of \ndegradation on the electrode surface area. \nFigure 3 Examples of degradation mechanisms on the \nelectrode surface \nWhen a solid (metal, semiconductor, insulator) is placed \ninto an electrolyte (ionic solution), an electrified interface \nis formed due to chemical reactions where electrons are \ntransferred between the solid and the electrolyte. The result \nis the formation of an electric field between the electrode \nand the electrolyte which stimulates further chemical \nreactions to take place. These reactions reach an \nPaper 22.2                                   INTERNATIONAL TEST CONFERENCE                                       4 \n                            \n                                                    \nequilibrium condition when the currents due to electron \ntransfer to and from the solid are equal. The result of this \nprocess is the Electrical Double Layer (EDL).  \nThis EDL therefore originates from spontaneously formed \nsurface charge near the electrode\/electrolyte interface \nwhich supports a net excess of mobile ions with a polarity \nopposite to that of the surface. Equilibrium is reached \nwhen sufficient charge separation is achieved at the \ninterface. Consequently, two layers are formed at the \nelectrode surface, namely the compact layer and the \ndiffusion layer. Two key mechanisms manifest themselves \nin the electrode\/electrolyte interface; capacitive effects, \nwhich dominate when voltages across the interface are \nsmall (as for neural signal recording), and a resistive effect \nwhich dominates when significant current flows. \nElectrodes are typically connected to the inputs of \nextremely high impedance amplifier circuits when used to \nrecord neural signals. This mode of operation involves \nmainly the capacitive properties of the electrodes. When \nused for the stimulation of neural signals where sufficient \ncurrent flow is required, electrodes behave resistively. In \nthis case electrochemical mechanisms are important.  \nLooking in more detail at the capacitive component of the \nEDL, it can be shown that CEDL can be modelled by an \nequivalent network consisting of CH, the compact layer \ncapacitance, CD, the diffusion capacitance, RD, the \ndiffusion layer resistance and RB, the bulk resistance, as \nshown in Figure 4. The resistance effect in the compact \nlayer has been neglected because the ions in this layer are \nto a first approximation immobilized. Table 2 shows the \ncalculated values for the EDL components. \n \nFigure 4  Extension of the electrode model to include \ncomponents of CEDL which can be replaced by CH, CD, RD and \nRB \nTable 2:  Calculated values of EDL components \nComponent Value \nCH 125 pF \nCD \u2265758 pF \nRD 3 M\u2126 \nRB 1 K\u2126 \nThe interface dominant capacitance of the EDL is CH and \ncan be approximately expressed as \n1XAC roH \u03b5\u03b5=     (1) \nwhere \u03b5o is the permittivity of free space, \u03b5r is the relative \npermittivity of the electrolyte and X1 is the length of the \ncompact capacitor (dominant capacitor), while A is the \nsurface area of the electrode. As discussed above, damage \nto the porous layer on the surface of the sensing electrodes \nis an important physical defect which results from a range \nof electrochemical, bio-chemical and electromagnetic \neffects. It is also noted that the surface area of the \nelectrode can be used to assess degradation because all key \nmechanisms will affect the active area and consequently \nchange the dominant capacitance, CH. Based on the model \nabove which describes the EDL at the electrode\/electrolyte \ninterface, the health status of the porous layer can be \nmonitored as a function of frequency. The values of the \nparameters for the equivalent circuit are shown in Table 2 \nand to consider the effect of the porous material on the \nEDL, it is assumed that the porous layer will produce a 10 \ntimes larger effective surface area than a similar flat \nelectrode. \n3.2 Simulation Results \nTo study the impact of the effective surface area of the \nelectrode on the oscillation frequency of a test circuit, CEDL \nwas inserted into the feedback of a standard oscillator \nstructure shown in Figure 5. \n \nFigure 5  CEDL Integrated into the oscillation structure \nThe value of the compact layer capacitance has been \nvaried to correspond to changes in an effective surface \narea between 1% and 100% of the nominal value. Figure 6 \nshows the simulation results where it is observed that the \ndecrease in effective surface area of the electrode will \nsignificantly impact the oscillation frequency. The \noscillator circuit used for characterisation of the \neffectiveness of OBT has used values for R1, R2, and R3 of \n1 M, 1 K and 100 K\u2126 respectively. \nPaper 22.2                                   INTERNATIONAL TEST CONFERENCE                                       5 \n                            \n                                                    \n \nFigure 6 Oscillation frequencies as a function of electrode \nsurface area \nThe reasons for choosing these values are to maximise the \nsensitivity to changes in CH and to avoid electrode damage \nfrom the feedback voltage. The feedback voltage (VE) can \nbe expressed as follows: \n)()()(\n32\n2 tk\nRR\nR\ntVtV EoutE ++\n\u00d7=\n                               (2) \n \n)()( tkVtV outOout +=\n                                                   (3) \n \nwhere VO is the power supply voltage of the op-amp, kE(t) \nand kout(t) are the slopes of the linearly increased or \ndecreased voltages VE(t) and Vout(t) respectively. Figure 7 \nshows the ideal output waveform of the oscillator and the \nrelated voltages. \n \nFigure 7 The ideal output waveform of the oscillator\n \nWith this set of values, the feedback voltage on the \nelectrode is around \u00b1 100 mV, and will be the same \namplitude and the same duration but opposite polarity. \nTherefore, the accumulated charge will flow back to the \nop-amp circuit and not held at the electrode. The nominal \nvalue of CH is assumed to be 125 pF, while CD, RD and RB \nare assumed to be constant because the change in electrode \nsurface area has no effect. This oscillator outputs a square \nwave at a frequency of around 110 KHz in the fault-free \ncase, and between 110 KHz and 250 KHz dependant on \nthe change in active area.  \nTo check the effect of the other parameters in the CEDL \nbranch on oscillation frequency and verify that CH is the \ndominant parameter, an initial exploration of the sensitivity \nof the method to changes in CEDL components has been \ncarried out. All values have been swept from nominal to \n50% of their values as shown in Table 3, where the \noscillation frequency has increased from 109 KHz to     \n147 KHz as a function of CH whilst the increase is only to \naround 117 KHz under changes to other parameters with \nCH constant. \nTable 3: Effect of change all CEDL parameters on the \noscillation frequency \nTest \ncase \nCH \n(pf) \nCD \n(pf) \nRD \n(M\u2126) \nRB \n(K\u2126) \nOscillation \nfrequency \n(KHz) \n1 125* 800* 3* 1* 109.28 \n2 93.75 800 3 1 124.59 \n3 62.50 800 3 1 147.34 \n4 125 600 3 1 111.65 \n5 125 400 3 1 117.31 \n6 125 800 2.25 1 109.22 \n7 125 800 1.5 1 109.86 \n8 125 800 3 0.75 108.08 \n9 125 800 3 0.50 107.58 \n10 125 600 2.25 0.75 111.32 \n11 125 400 1.50 0.50 115.36 \n* refers to CEDL nominal values \n4. Experimental Results \n4.1 EDL Capacitance and Measurement \nDeviation \nTo verify the oscillation-based self-test solution, an \nexperiment on an MEA demonstrator has been carried out. \nThis MEA has 60 planer electrodes fabricated on a glass \nsubstrate. The electrode surface is sputtered with TiN \nforming a mechanically stable columnar structure in order \nto increase the effective surface area. In this experiment, \nthe EDL capacitance is measured directly using a Wayne \nKerr Precision Impedance Analyzer 6500. Measurements \nare conducted by connecting the impedance analyser to the \ntarget electrode and the ground electrode. In the set-up, the \nground electrode serving as an internal reference is shorted \nwith the electrolyte bath ground, and connected to the \nelectronics ground in order to provide a common ground \nbetween the electronics and the bath. \nTo check and demonstrate the deviation in the EDL \ncapacitance for the fault-free electrodes, CEDL readings for \nten fault-free electrodes were captured as shown in     \nTable 4. The nominal value for CEDL has been assumed to \nPaper 22.2                                   INTERNATIONAL TEST CONFERENCE                                       6 \n                            \n                                                    \nbe 180.64 pF, and as identified in the measurements, the \nmaximum deviation is less than \u00b15%. The capacitance is \nmeasured for the condition where the system is stimulated \nwith a 50 mV input at 10 KHz. \nTable 4: CEDL readings for randomly selected fault-free \nelectrodes \nElectrode No. CEDL (pf) Deviation \n75 180.640 Nominal \n85 180.144 -0.2747% \n27 178.560 -1.1518% \n46 176.704 -2.1790% \n26 189.394 +4.8459% \n38 178.779 -1.0305% \n53 180.173 -0.2587% \n74 187.815 +3.9720% \n17 189.323 +4.8067% \n51 187.160 +3.6091% \n4.2 Degradation Effect on EDL Capacitance and \nOscillation Frequency \nTo demonstrate the effect of the electrode surface \ndegradation on the EDL capacitance and to extract CEDL \nmeasurements at different levels of degradation, another \nexperiment on an MEA has been carried out. The electrode \nsurface has been artificially damaged by repeatedly \nstimulating the electrodes with voltage pulses (1 Volt). \nUnder these conditions the stimulating electrode behaves \nas a plate capacitor with the accumulated charge \nmaintained on the surface resulting in time dependant \ndegradation due to electrolysis [24]. Figures 8 and 9 show \nthree-dimensional images for fault-free and artificially \ndamaged electrodes respectively. These images have been \ncaptured using a Veeco Wyko NT100 White Light \nInterferometer. As can be seen from these figures, the \neffect of the stress pulses on the electrode surface area is \nthe loss of large areas of the porous layer due to \nelectrolysis. \n \nFigure 8 3-D interactive image for fault-free electrode \n \nFigure 9  3-D interactive image for faulty electrode after \napplication of stress pulses \nThis damage impacts the functionality of the surface \nporous layer and is the most widely reported degradation \nmechanism in typical applications. The EDL capacitance \nhas been measured after specific time points within the \nstress program to extract the CEDL signature as a function \nof pulse time. The period of the stress pulse is 5 seconds \nwith a stress program duration of 150 seconds. By \nstimulating the electrode with these pulses CEDL has \ndecreased from around 180 pF to 55 pF.  As a \nconsequence, the oscillation frequency has increased from \n78 KHz to about 150 KHz. Table 5 shows the change in \nthe stress pulse time, CEDL and the oscillation frequency \nover the duration of the stress program. \n \nTable 5: The change in CEDL and the oscillation frequency \nwith the stress pulse time \nStress pulse time \n(s) \nCEDL (pF) Oscillation \nfrequency \n(KHz) \n0 180.6 78.19 \n5 143.7 89.92 \n10 136.1 92.79 \n15 121.5 99.32 \n20 101.3 110.12 \n25 97.8 112.93 \n30 95.2 114.12 \n35 91.7 116.61 \n40 88.4 118.73 \n45 87.6 119.13 \n50 81.9 122.26 \n60 76.2 127.86 \n70 72.4 131.33 \n80 68.7 134.57 \n90 63.6 139.18 \n100 59.3 144.27 \n120 57.2 145.51 \n150 55.1 148.36 \nPaper 22.2                                   INTERNATIONAL TEST CONFERENCE                                       7 \n                            \n                                                    \nComparing the oscillation frequency measurements in \nTable 5 with the expected simulation results (Figure 6), a \ndifference in the frequency range can be observed. This \ncan be related to the following: Firstly, the electrode \nsurface area is made from high porosity material (TiN). It \nis difficult to calculate this area exactly due to its micro- \nstructure. Secondly, there is a difference between the input \nimpedance of the op-amp in the simulation and the \nexperimental test bench. In addition, there is the effect of \nthe parasitic capacitance, electrolyte spreading resistance \nand the difference between the physical behaviour in the \nexperiments and simulation work. As a consequence, all \nthese factors will affect the frequency range, but the main \ngoal is still valid because the changes in the measurement \nbetween the fault-free and faulty cases are doubled for the \nwhole frequency range. \n4.3 OBT Implementation at the System Level \nTo monitor the condition of the micro electrode array and \nverify the effectiveness of OBT in the system-level design, \nthis technique has been applied to a device with 32 \nmicroelectrodes. The system consists of a control unit, an \nanalogue multiplexer, and the test circuit. The whole \nsystem architecture is shown in figure 10. \n \nFigure 10  The system architecture \nThe oscillation circuit in figure 5 is used to characterize \nthe effectiveness of the OBT and study the effect of the \nsystem-level parameters on the output frequency in the \nfault-free and faulty cases. An ADG732 analogue \nmultiplexer (monolithic CMOS 32-channel) has been used \nto connect the micro electrode array (32 electrodes from \nthe MEA) to the oscillator test circuit. This multiplexer \nswitches the inputs (S0-S31) to a common output as \ndetermined by the 5-bit binary address lines (A0-A4). The \ncontrol unit is responsible for synchronization of the whole \nsystem. An Atmel megaAVR series microcontroller has \nbeen used for this purpose. The ATmega8A is a low-power \nCMOS 8-bit microcontroller based on the AVR RISC \narchitecture which is programmed in \u201cC\u201d to increment the \noutput port after a defined delay using the built-in timer. \nThe output port is limited to the 16-bit address range of the \nAMUX IC so only valid addresses can be selected on the \nAMUX. This particular microcontroller could uniquely \naddress up to eight 16-bit AMUX ICs simultaneously.  \nThe system provides on-line monitoring of the degradation \nstates of 32 electrodes, and it is triggered by a control \nsignal from the microcontroller. Depending on the control \nsignal, the multiplexer connects each electrode for a \ncertain time with the test circuit. This utilizes the output \nport, and the address lines. The test circuit converts the \nEDL capacitance to a frequency, which when compared \nwith a nominal value, indicates the degradation level of the \nelectrode under test. Figure 11 shows the code flow for the \ntest algorithm. \n \nFigure 11 The code-flow for the test algorithm \nTo validate the test technique and illustrate the effect of \nthe system parameters, an experiment on the MEA has \nbeen carried out. Thirty-two electrodes from the MEA \nwere connected through the multiplexer to the test circuit. \nDifferent levels of degradation have been emulated by \nartificially damaging the surface area of ten electrodes with \nvoltage stress pulses of 1V amplitude and differing \nperiods. The microcontroller has been programmed to \nincrement output port B and a delay time of two seconds \nhas been used to connect each electrode to the oscillator. \nFigure 12 shows the frequency measurements where the \ntest technique has accurately distinguished the degraded \nelectrodes and the level of the degradation. The fault-free \nfrequency is denoted by fosc. \nPaper 22.2                                   INTERNATIONAL TEST CONFERENCE                                       8 \n                            \n                                                    \n \nFigure 12 Oscillation frequency measurements for 32 \nelectrodes \nTo demonstrate the effect of the analogue multiplexer \ninput capacitance and resistance on the measurements, the \noscillation frequency of ten electrodes (the same electrodes \ndegraded by varying stress inputs) have been measured \nwith and without the multiplexer. Single wires have been \nused in this experiment to avoid the coupling capacitance \nof the ribbon cable (Table 6). The effect of the self \nresistance, self capacitance and the coupling capacitance \non the frequency measurements has also been \ndemonstrated in a second experiment where the single \nwires have been replaced with ribbon cable. The \nequivalent circuit per unit length for the interface between \nthe electrodes and the analogue multiplexer can be seen in \nFigure 13, where RS, CS, CC, and N are the self resistance, \nthe self capacitance, the coupling capacitance, and the line \nnumbers of the ribbon cable. \n \nFigure 13  The per unit length electrical equivalent circuit for \nthe ribbon cable \nTable 6 shows the oscillation frequency measurements \nwhen single wires without the AMUX were used, and then \nwhen AMUX was inserted.

The fault-free frequency \nhas decreased by 7% while the full-range of the output \nfrequency between the fault-free and the faulty cases has \nalso decreased from 1.93% without AMUX to around \n1.82% with the AMUX.  \nThe ribbon cable parameters have also affected the \nmeasurements, where the fault-free oscillation frequency \nhas decreased by 12%. The full-range measurements have \nalso been limited by the self and coupling capacitances \nfrom 1.82% with single wires to around 1.75% with ribbon \ncable.  \nTo check and validate the test technique for other types of \ndefects, three electrodes were chosen to verify the \neffectiveness for short and open circuits. Electrodes 57 and \n58 have been shorted at the contact pins while an open \ncircuit has been made by splitting the contact pin from the \ncontact pad for electrode number 63. In the first case, the \noscillation frequency has decreased to around 30% of its \nnormal value because the effective surface area has \nphysically doubled due to the short between the electrodes. \nIn the second case, and due to the open circuit between the \ncontact pin and the contact pad, the output frequency has \nincreased to around 230% of its normal value. This \nsuggests that this test technique can easily detect the faulty \nelectrodes at different levels of degradation, and \ndistinguish them from other different types of faults due to \nthe frequency measurements and their deviation from the \nnormal value. \nPaper 22.2                                   INTERNATIONAL TEST CONFERENCE                                       9 \n                            \n                                                    \n5. Conclusions \nAn oscillation-based test and diagnosis technique for an \nelectrode structure has been presented which is based on \nthe sensitivity of the bio-fluidic interface capacitance to \ndegradation, contamination and fouling. The technique has \nthe potential to be built into integrated bio-fluidic systems. \nThe design of the monitoring structure has been evaluated \nthrough physical characterisation involving data extracted \nfor both a single electrode and an array of electrodes. The \ntechnique provides an analogue value directly related to \nthe degradation of the electrode, so has the ability to \nprovide on-line degradation detection for a range of \nconditions on the electrode surface.  \nThe validation of the on-line application of this solution to \na normal operating MEA, and the effect of the feedback \nvoltage on the measurements, requires further study. In \naddition, the possibility of using this technique to detect \nother types of degradation needs to be considered. \nFuture work will involve the further development of \narchitectures where the integration of this technique into a \nhigher level control system will support adaptability to \nensure defective electrodes can be switched out of the \nsystem and the array reconfigured to maintain \nfunctionality. Of further importance is how electrode \nmonitoring strategies can be integrated with other sensors \nand test solutions within a portable instrument. \n6.
