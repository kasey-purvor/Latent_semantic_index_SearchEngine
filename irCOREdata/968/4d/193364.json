The mi-\ntotic checkpoint pathway is regulated by a group of evolu-\ntionarily conserved genes that include MAD1, MAD2,\nMAD3 (or BUBR1), BUB1, BUB3, and MPS1 (Burke, 2000).\nThese proteins preferentially bind to the kinetochores of\nunattached chromosomes where they are thought to gener-\nate the signal that suppresses anaphase onset (Burke, 2000;\nShah and Cleveland, 2000). Currently, there are two ways in\nwhich the mitotic checkpoint can be activated experimen-\ntally. First, cells can be treated with chemicals that perturb\nmicrotubule dynamics such as nocodazole, taxol, vincristine,\nand vinblastine (Li and Benezra, 1996; Sorger et al., 1997). By\neither depolymerizing (nocodazole, vincristine, and vinblas-\ntine) or stabilizing (taxol) microtubules, these agents activate\nthe mitotic checkpoint and induce a mitotic cell cycle arrest\n(Sorger et al., 1997). Second, overexpression of the MAD\n(mitotic arrest deficient) checkpoint proteins has been re-\nported to activate the spindle checkpoint and cause mitotic\narrest (Fang et al., 1999; Geley et al., 2001). Regardless of the\nmethod of activation, a common feature of the checkpoint-\narrested cells is a tendency to undergo apoptotic cell death.\nFor example, many agents used to activate the mitotic check-\npoint experimentally are also used clinically in the treatment\nof cancer (Rowinsky and Donehower, 1991; Wilson and\nJordan, 1995) and induce apoptosis in the mitotically ar-\nrested cells (Woods et al., 1995; Jordan et al., 1996). Therefore,\nthe available evidence links activation of the mitotic check-\npoint with apoptosis, although the biochemical mechanisms\nArticle published online ahead of print. Mol. Biol.

MAPKs comprise a\nfamily of serine\/threonine protein kinases that function as\ncritical mediators of signal transduction (Kyriakis and\nAvruch, 2001) and include the extracellular signal-regulated\nkinases (ERKs), the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNKs), and\nthe p38 MAPKs. The ERKs are activated in response to\nmitogen or growth factor stimulation, whereas the JNKs and\np38 MAPKs are activated by proinflammatory cytokines and\na variety of cellular stresses, including UV light, hyperos-\nmolarity, heat shock, and microtubule disrupting drugs\n(Wang et al., 1998, 2000; Yujiri et al., 1999; Kyriakis and\nAvruch, 2001; Okano and Rustgi, 2001; McDaid and Hor-\nwitz, 2001; Stadheim et al., 2001). The PAKs are a group of\nserine\/threonine protein kinases that are directly activated\nby the GTPases Rac and Cdc42. Together with Ras, these\nGTPases also activate mitogen-activated protein (MAP) ki-\nnase pathways and regulate diverse cellular processes such\nas cell morphology, motility, transformation, and apoptosis\n(Bagrodia and Cerione, 1999).\nIn the current study, we have examined the function of\np38 MAPK in mitotically arrested HeLa cells. We show that\nantimicrotubule drugs cause concomitant activation of a p38\nMAPK-mediated proapoptotic signaling pathway and a\nPAK-mediated prosurvival signaling pathway in the mitot-\nically arrested cells. p38 MAPK stimulates apoptosis in mi-\ntotically arrested cells by inducing translocation of the pro-\napoptotic protein Bax from the cytoplasm to the\nmitochondria, whereas PAK opposes p38 MAPK-induced\ncell death by phosphorylating the proapoptotic protein Bad.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nCell Culture and Preparation of Cell Extracts\nHuman cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa) were cultured as described\npreviously (Patel et al., 1999). To obtain mitotically arrested cells, an\nasynchronous population of HeLa cells was treated with either\nnocodazole (3 \u0001M), taxol (1 \u0001M), vincristine (1 \u0001M), or vinblastine\n(1 \u0001M) for various times (0\u201330 h). Mitotic cells were collected by\nmechanical shake-off, washed in Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate-buffered sa-\nline (DPBS), and lysed in the appropriate buffer, depending on the\nprotein kinase being assayed as described previously (Patel et al.,\n1998). Radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) assay buffer was used to\nprepare cell lysates for immunoblotting with the poly ADP-ribose\npolymerase (PARP) antibody. Cells remaining attached to the plates\nafter shake-off were washed three times with DPBS (containing\neither nocodazole [3 \u0001M], taxol [1 \u0001M], vincristine [1 \u0001M], or\nvinblastine [1 \u0001M]) and lysed by scraping into the appropriate\nbuffer. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 \u0001 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C,\nand the protein content of the supernatant was determined using\nthe Coomassie protein assay reagent (Pierce Chemical, Rockford, IL)\nbefore normalization and solubilization in two times SDS-PAGE\nsample buffer. Cell lysates for Western blotting with the Bad anti-\nbody or the phospho-specific Bad antibodies were solubilized in\nSDS-PAGE sample buffer before sonication for 10\u201315 s.\nAntibodies\np38\u0002, Erk1, Erk2, cdk1, anti-hemagglutinin epitope tag (HA), and\nPAK\u0002 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz,\nCA). Anti-FLAG (M2), Cy3-conjugated anti-FLAG (M2), anti-\u0003-tu-\nbulin, anti-\u0004-actin, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat\nanti-mouse, HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit, and HRP-conjugated\nmouse anti-goat were from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Anti-\nJNK1 (BD Biosciences PharMingen, San Diego, CA) anti-M30, which\ndetects caspase cleavage, and cytokeratin 18 (Leers et al., 1999) was\nfrom Roche Diagnostics (Indianapolis, IN), along with anti-PARP\n(Roche Diagnostics). Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG, Alexa\nFluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG, and Alexa Fluor 594 rabbit anti-\nmouse IgG were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Phosphospe-\ncific anti-Bad and total anti-Bad were from New England Biolabs\n(Beverly, MA).\nPlasmids and Mutagenesis\nThe expression vectors (FLAG epitope-tagged in pCDNA3) for p38\u0002\n(murine), p38\u0004 (human), p38\u0003 (human), and p38\u0005 (human) were\nprovided by J. Han (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). The\nfollowing expression vectors (all FLAG epitope-tagged in pCDNA3)\nwere provided by R. Davis (University of Massachusetts Medical\nCenter, Amherst, MA): dominant active (DA) MKK6 (S207D,\nT211D), kinase dead (KD) MKK6, glutathione S-transferase (GST)-\np38\u0002 wild-type (WT), and GST-MKK6 (WT). The following expres-\nsion constructs (all HA-epitope-tagged in the pXJ vector) were\nprovided by E. Manser (Glaxo-Singapore, Singapore): PAK\u0002 (WT),\nDAPAK\u0002 (L106F), and KDPAK\u0002 (K298A). The expression vector for\ngreen fluorescent protein (GFP)-human bax was provided by R.\nYoule (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The constructs\nfor generating recombinant GST-fusion proteins of murine wild-\ntype Bad (mBad) were provided by G. Bokoch (Scripps Research\nInstitute). The mammalian expression vector for GST-mBad (pEB-\nGmBad) was purchased from New England Biolabs. The pEBG\nempty vector was provided by D. Alessi (University of Dundee,\nDundee, United Kingdom). In vitro mutagenesis of mBAD was\ncarried out using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit\n(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol.\nHuman MAD2 was cloned from a HeLa cell cDNA library (Strat-\nagene) by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into a mamma-\nlian expression vector (pCMV5) containing an N-terminal HA tag.\nImmunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis\nImmunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (Pa-\ntel et al., 1998). The immunoprecipitated proteins and the cell ex-\ntracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto Hy-\nbond-C nitrocellulose membrane by using a Hoeffer semidry\nblotting apparatus (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). Immu-\nnoreactive proteins were visualized using enhanced chemilumines-\ncence (Amersham Biosciences). For immunoblotting with the phos-\nphospecific Bad antibodies, the procedure recommended by the\nmanufacturer was strictly followed.\nProtein Kinase Assays\nImmunecomplex kinase assays for JNK1, p38 MAPK, Erk1, Erk2,\nand cdk1 were performed as described previously (Patel et al., 1998)\nusing GST-c-Jun, GST-activating transcription factor-2 (ATF-2), my-\nelin basic protein (MBP), and histone H1 as substrates, respectively.\nThe activity of the immunoprecipiated PAK\u0002 was assayed as de-\nscribed above for JNK1 (Patel et al., 1998) by using a GST-fusion\ncontaining the N-terminal 290 amino acids of mitogen-activated\nprotein kinase kinase kinase (MEKK)2 as substrate (Deacon and\nBlank, 1999; Hagemann and Blank, 2001). Incorporated radioactivity\nwas quantified by liquid scintillation counting of bands excised\nfrom SDS-PAGE gels.\nK. Deacon et al.\nMolecular Biology of the Cell2072\nFlow Cytometry\nAnalysis of the DNA content was performed by flow cytometry\n(FACScan; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) as described previously\n(Patel et al., 1998).\nTransfection of HeLa Cells\nHeLa cells were plated at a density of \u00025 \u0001 105 cells\/well in a\nsix-well plate or at 1 \u0001 105 cells\/well for coverslips in an eight-well\nplate. Eighteen to 24 h later, the cells were transfected with 1\u20134 \u0001g\nof DNA by using FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer\u2019s in-\nstructions (Roche Diagnostics). At 18\u201324 h after transfection, the\ncells on the coverslips were either fixed in cold (\u000320\u00b0C) methanol or\nincubated with MitoTracker red CMXRos (500 nM; Molecular\nProbes) for 15 min at 37\u00b0C, washed two times with DPBS, and fixed\nfor 10 min in 4% (vol\/vol) formaldehyde in DPBS. The cells were\nthen processed for immunofluorescence microscopy as described\nbelow. The cells in the six-well plates were either washed two times\nwith DPBS and lysed in the appropriate buffer to make cell extracts\nor collected (floating and attached cells) either for flow cytometry or\nfor the determination of apoptosis as described above.\nImmunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy\nHeLa cells were grown either on coverslips or in eight-well cham-\nbered slides (Nalge Nunc, Naperville, IL) and where indicated the\ncells were transfected as described above. The cells were washed\nthree times in DPBS and fixed either in cold (\u000320\u00b0C) methanol for 30\nmin at \u000320\u00b0C or in 4% (vol\/vol) formaldehyde in DPBS for 30 min\nat room temperature (for MitoTracker). Cells were rinsed five times\nwith phosphate-buffered saline and the aldehyde-fixed cells perme-\nabilized in 0.1% (vol\/vol) Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline\nfor 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then blocked with 1%\n(wt\/vol) bovine serum albumin (BSA) (in DPBS) for 45\u201360 min at\nroom temperature. The following primary antibodies, diluted in 1%\n(wt\/vol) BSA in DPBS, were used for immunocytochemistry:\n\u0002-FLAG (M2), \u0002-FLAG (M2) Cy3-conjugate, or \u0002-HA. After incuba-\ntion at room temperature for 60 min, the cells were washed five\ntimes with DPBS before incubation with the secondary antibody for\na further 60 min at room temperature. The following secondary\nantibodies, diluted in 1% (wt\/vol) BSA in DPBS, were used: sheep\nanti-mouse IgG, Texas Red conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG, fluo-\nrescein isothiocyanate-conjugated and donkey anti-rabbit IgG, flu-\norescein isothiocyanate-conjugated. The cells were washed five\ntimes with DPBS and the nuclei labeled by staining with Hoechst\n33258 (1 \u0001g\/ml in DPBS) for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were\nviewed on an inverted fluorescence microscope (TE3000; Nikon,\nTokyo, Japan), and images were captured through a 100\u0001 objective\n(numerical aperture 1.4) by using an Orca ER charge-coupled device\ncamera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Bridgewater, NJ). For deconvolu-\ntion the images were captured in the z-plane at 1-\u0001m intervals by\nusing a 100\u0001 piezo-driven objective (numerical aperture 1.4). The\nimages were volume deconvolved and merged using Openlab soft-\nware (Improvision, Coventry, United Kingdom). The Openlab im-\nages were subsequently compiled in Photoshop (Adobe Systems,\nMountain View, CA). Confocal scanning microscopy was per-\nformed on a Leitz DM IRB\/E TCS4D (Leica, Wezlar, Germany). A\nkrypton\/argon laser was used for fluorescence excitation of GFP\n(488 nm), MitoTracker red (568 nm), Hoechst 33342 (364 nm), and\nCy5 (647 nm). Images were processed and maximum projections\nmade using Scanware (Leica). Tiff files for all four fluorochromes\nwere merged using OpenLab software.\nPreparation of Recombinant GST Fusion Proteins\nRecombinant GST-c-Jun, GST-ATF-2, GST-MEKK2 (N terminus),\nGST-MKK6 (wt), and GST-p38\u0002 were prepared as described previ-\nously (Deacon and Blank, 1999).\nReagents\nSB203580 and SB202190 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA).

Analysis of the nocodazole-treated cells\nby flow cytometry (Figure 1B) indicated the presence of two\npopulations: a mitotic population with high cdk1 activity\n(Figure 2, A and B) and an attached, nonmitotic population\nwith low cdk1 activity (Figure 2, B and C).\nWe evaluated the activity of the MAPKs in the nocoda-\nzole-treated cells by using immunocomplex kinase assays.\np38 MAPK was activated primarily in the mitotically ar-\nrested population (Figure 2A). Immunoblot analysis of p38\u0002\nimmunoprecipitates indicated that the activation of p38\nMAPK was not due to variations in the level of immuno-\nprecipitated p38 protein. In contrast to p38 MAPK, both JNK\nand Erk MAP kinases were activated primarily in the at-\ntached cells (Figure 2, A and B). The activation of MAP\nkinase family members was evaluated further using alterna-\ntive drugs that perturb microtubule dynamics and cause\nmitotic arrest. As observed with nocodazole, treatment of\nHeLa cells with either taxol (1 \u0001M), vincristine (1 \u0001M), or\nvinblastine (1 \u0001M) caused mitotic arrest (as shown by high\ncdk1 activity; Figure 2C) and activated p38 MAPK selec-\ntively in the mitotically arrested population. With the excep-\ntion of taxol, which activated JNK equally in both the mitotic\nand the attached cells, vincristine, vinblastine, and nocoda-\nzole activated JNK preferentially in the attached cells (Figure\n2C). All four drugs also activated the Erk MAP kinases\npreferentially in the attached cell population (Figure 2C).\nImportantly, treatment of HeLa cells with cytochalasin D (5\n\u0001M) or EDTA (0.5 mM) to induce cell rounding or detach-\nment did not activate p38 but did stimulate JNK activity (our\nunpublished data). Furthermore, p38 MAPK was selectively\nactivated in mitotic mouse NIH3T3 cells arrested with either\nnocodazole, taxol, vincristine, and vinblastine (our unpub-\nlished data). These results indicate that p38 MAPK is spe-\ncifically activated in mammalian cells mitotically arrested by\nmicrotubule-interfering drugs.\nWe also evaluated whether p38 MAPK was activated in a\nsynchronized population of mitotic HeLa cells. In normal\nmitotic cells (Mit), containing high cdk1 activity, p38 MAPK\nactivity was not detected compared with cells arrested in\nmitosis with nocodazole (Noc; Figure 2D). To further con-\nfirm that p38 MAPK activation was not necessary for normal\nmitosis, we used the p38 MAPK inhibitors SB203580 and\nSB202190 (Lee et al., 1994). Addition of either SB203580 (20\n\u0001M) or SB202190 (10 \u0001M) to HeLa cells 3 h after release from\nan aphidicolin-thymidine double block had no effect on\neither entry into or exit from mitosis compared with vehicle-\ntreated control cells (our unpublished data). These results\np38 MAPK, PAK, and Mitotic Arrest\nVol. 14, May 2003 2073\nsuggest that p38 MAPK is unlikely to be activated during\nnormal mitosis.\nBecause p38 MAPK is activated only in the mitotically\narrested cells, we performed a time-course analysis of p38\nactivation at intervals after the addition of nocodazole (3\n\u0001M) to asynchronous HeLa cells. JNK activity was also\nassayed in parallel. At 6 h after nocodazole addition, when\nthe majority of the cells was still attached (\u000490%), p38\nMAPK activity was low, whereas JNK activity was maximal\n(Figure 3, A and B). From 12 h onward, we were able to\ncollect purely mitotic cells by shake-off as assessed by high\ncdk1 activity. The activation of p38 MAPK correlated closely\nwith that of cdk1, whereas JNK activity had returned to near\nbasal levels 12 h after nocodazole addition (Figure 3, A and\nB). Furthermore, removal of nocodazole from the mitotically\narrested cells resulted in exit from mitosis, as shown by the\ninactivation of cdk1. This inactivation of cdk1 correlated\nwith the inactivation of p38 (Figure 3, C and D), providing\nfurther evidence that p38 MAPK activation is specifically\nassociated with mitotic arrest.\nPAK Is Also Activated Preferentially in Mitotically\nArrested Cells\nWe examined the activation of the PAK\u0002 in mitotically\narrested HeLa cells. PAK\u0002 and p38 MAPK activity was\nanalyzed at intervals after the addition of nocodazole (3 \u0001M)\nto exponentially growing cells. PAK\u0002 activation paralleled\np38 MAPK activation, both occurring selectively in the mi-\ntotic population at 12 h and remaining elevated for up to\n30 h. Neither PAK\u0002 nor p38 MAPK activation was observed\nin the attached population over the same time period (Figure\n4A). Similar results were obtained after treatment of HeLa\ncells with taxol (our unpublished data). HeLa cells treated\nwith taxol (1 \u0001M), vincristine (1 \u0001M), or vinblastine (1 \u0001M)\nalso selectively activated both p38 MAPK and PAK in the\nmitotically arrested cells (Figure 4B). Treatment of HeLa\ncells with either cytochalasin D (5 \u0001M) or EDTA (0.5 mM)\ndid not activate PAK (our unpublished data). Furthermore,\nremoval of the mitotic block in nocodazole-arrested cells\nresulted in inactivation of PAK as cells exited mitosis, as\nassessed by inactivation of cdk1 (Figure 4C). However, PAK\ninactivation seemed to be delayed relative to that of p38\nMAPK. Collectively, these results suggest that activation of\nboth PAK and p38 MAPK is specifically associated with\nmitotic arrest.\nTo determine whether PAK is an upstream activator of\np38 MAPK in HeLa cells we cotransfected either wild-type\n(WT) or dominant active (DA) PAK (L106F) with WT p38\u0002.\nDAPAK, in comparison with WT PAK, was highly active as\nassessed by its ability to phosphorylate GST-Mekk2 but was\nunable to activate cotransfected p38\u0002, as measured GST-\nATF2 phosphorylation (Figure 4D). The transfected p38\u0002\nwas, however, activated by anisomycin as assessed by phos-\nphorylation of GST-ATF2. These data suggest that DAPAK\nis not coupled to p38 MAPK activation in HeLa cells.\np38 MAPK Activation Stimulates Apoptotic Cell\nDeath, whereas PAK Activation Promotes Cell\nSurvival\nThe effect of nocodazole on cell death was assessed in both\nthe attached and the mitotically arrested populations by\nFigure 1.

(D) HeLa cells were\nsynchronized using the aphidico-\nlin-thymidine double block\nmethod as described in MATERI-\nALS AND METHODS. Eight to\n10 h after release from the cell\ncycle block, mitotic cells were col-\nlected by shake-off and the acti-\nvation of p38 MAPK, JNK, and\ncdk1 in this mitotic cell popula-\ntion (Mit) determined as de-\nscribed in A. Protein extracts\nfrom nocodazole-treated (3 \u0001M\nfor 12 h) HeLa cells were also\nanalyzed in parallel as a positive\ncontrol for the activation of p38\nMAPK.\np38 MAPK, PAK, and Mitotic Arrest\nVol. 14, May 2003 2075\neither immunoblotting with an anti-PARP antibody or im-\nmunostaining with the M30 antibody. Nocodazole-induced\npoly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage was appar-\nent in the mitotic cells at 12 h after drug addition and\ncontinued to increase over the time course examined (Figure\n5A). Treatment of HeLa cells with either taxol (1 \u0001M), vin-\ncristine (1 \u0001M), or vinblastine (1 \u0001M) also caused PARP\ncleavage, preferentially in the mitotic population (Figure\n5B). Nocodazole also induced cleavage of cytokeratin 18 and\ncaused a time-dependent increase in the number of apopto-\ntic cells specifically in the mitotic cell population (Figure 5C,\nright).\nTo determine whether p38 MAPK was involved in this\napoptotic response, p38 MAPK inhibitors were used.\nSB203580 (20 \u0001M) or SB202190 (10 \u0001M) reduced the number\nof apoptotic cells in the mitotic population by 46 and 42%,\nrespectively, as assessed by cytokeratin 18 cleavage (Figure\n5D). The relationship between p38 MAPK activity and apo-\nptosis was examined further by transfecting HeLa cells with\ndominant active (DA) MAP kinase kinase, MKK6 (S207D,\nT211D). Consistent with previous reports (Derijard et al.,\n1995; Jiang et al., 1997) DAMKK6 activated all coexpressed\np38 MAPK isoforms (Figure 6A). Transient expression of\ndaMKK6 in HeLa cells caused apoptosis, as assessed by\ncytokeratin 18 cleavage and chromatin fragmentation (Fig-\nure 6B). The DAMKK6-induced apoptosis is likely to be\nmediated through activation of endogenous p38 MAPK,\nbecause treatment of the transfected cells with either\nSB303580 (20 \u0001M) or SB202190 (20 \u0001M) inhibited apoptosis\nby \u000267% (Figure 6C).\nTo address the function of PAK in mitotically arrested\ncells, DAPAK\u0002 (L106F) was transfected into HeLa cells,\neither separately or together with DAMKK6 (Figure 6D),\nand their effect on survival assayed using the M30 antibody.\nIn the absence of any treatment, 2% of the cells were found\nto be apoptotic (Figure 6E). Transfection with the empty\nvector alone increased the number of apoptotic cells to 12%.\nIn contrast, 54% of DAMKK6-transfected cells were found to\nbe apoptotic as assessed by the presence of both cleaved\ncytokeratin 18 and fragmented chromatin, whereas a signal-\ning inactive mutant of MKK6 (S207A, T211A) did not induce\napoptosis (14%). Coexpression of DAPAK with DAMKK6\nsuppressed DAMKK6-induced apoptosis to near basal levels\n(18%), whereas KDPAK did not affect the level of MKK6-\ninduced apoptosis. We also determined whether PAK aids\ncell survival of nocodazole-arrested mitotic cells. Treatment\nof DAPAK-transfected HeLa cells with nocodazole (3 \u0001M for\n24 h) reduced the number of apoptotic cells in the mitotic\npopulation by 56% (nocodazole: percentage of M30 positive\ncells \u0005 SEM; 34.2 \u0005 3.4, n \u0006 3; nocodazole \u0007 DAPAK: 15 \u0005\n2.2, n \u0006 3). These results suggest that nocodazole activates\ntwo signaling pathways in mitotically arrested cells that\nhave opposing effects on cell survival. Activation of p38\nMAPK either by nocodazole or MKK6 stimulates cell death,\nwhereas activation of PAK stimulates cell survival.\nDAMKK6 Induces Bax Translocation from the\nCytoplasm to the Mitochondria and PAK\nPhosphorylates Bad\nTo examine the mechanism by which p38 MAPK and PAK\nexert their effect on cell survival, we examined whether\nthese enzymes regulate the activity of the bcl-2 family mem-\nbers Bad and Bax.

Deacon et al.\nMolecular Biology of the Cell2076\nlular distribution of Bax was investigated by cotransfecting\nHeLa cells with DAMKK6 and a GFP-Bax fusion construct.\nBoth GFP-Bax (Figure 7A) and MKK6 (Figure 7B) were\ndistributed homogeneously throughout the cytoplasm of\nexponentially growing cells when expressed alone. Cotrans-\nfection of GFP-Bax with DAMKK6 resulted in a dramatic\nchange in the distribution of Bax from a homogeneous dis-\ntribution to a more punctate, perinuclear distribution (Fig-\nure 7C). Early morphological changes (16 h after transfec-\ntion) included cell rounding and membrane blebbing\n(Figure 7C). At later times (36 h after transfection), chroma-\ntin condensation and fragmentation was accompanied by\ncell shrinkage (Figure 7D). In control experiments where\nKDMKK6 was cotransfected with GFP-Bax, Bax remained\nhomogeneously distributed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig-\nure 7E). In addition, cotransfection of DAMKK6 with a\nplasmid expressing GFP alone caused no redistribution of\nGFP (Figure 7F). To determine whether the DAMKK6-in-\nduced redistribution of Bax was mediated through activa-\ntion of p38 MAPK, cells cotransfected with GFP-Bax and\nDAMKK6 were treated with either SB203580 or SB202190. In\ncells transfected with GFP-Bax alone, Bax showed a punc-\ntate, perinuclear distribution in 14% of the cells. However, in\ncells coexpressing both GFP-Bax and DAMKK6, 55% of the\ncells displayed a punctate, perinuclear distribution of Bax. In\nthe presence of either SB203580 (20 \u0001M) or SB202190 (10 \u0001M)\nthe translocation of Bax to the perinuclear region was re-\nduced to near basal levels (16%) (Figure 7G).\nWe determined whether DAMKK6 was inducing redistri-\nbution of GFP-Bax to the mitochondria. In cells cotransfected\nwith GFP-Bax and DAMKK6 (Figure 8, A\u2013E), the punctate\ndistribution of GFP-Bax (Figure 8A) coincided with mito-\nchondrial staining by MitoTracker red (Figure 8B). These\nresults demonstrate that the DAMKK6-induced activation of\np38 MAPK is sufficient to stimulate Bax translocation from\nthe cytosol to the mitochondria. Next, we determined\nwhether Bax also translocates to the mitochondria in no-\ncodazole-arrested mitotic cells. HeLa cells transfected with\nFigure 4.

These experiments indicated that Bax translo-\ncates from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria in nocodazole-\narrested mitotic cells as they undergo apoptosis.\nConsistent with previous data regarding Bad phosphory-\nlation by PAK (Schurmann et al., 2000), our studies have\nindicated that recombinant PAK\u0002 and native PAK\u0002, immu-\nnoprecipitated from nocodazole-arrested mitotic cells, both\nefficiently phosphorylated recombinant GST-mBad (our un-\npublished data). Because our current data have shown that\nPAK\u0002 is activated in mitotically arrested cells, we evaluated\nwhether Bad is also phosphorylated in this cell population.\nWestern blots of native Bad indicated that the mobility of the\nBad protein was retarded preferentially in the mitotically\narrested cells, suggesting that Bad undergoes posttransla-\ntional modification in this population (Figure 9A). To assess\nthe phosphorylation state of Bad in the mitotically arrested\ncells HeLa cells were transfected with a mammalian expres-\nsion vector encoding GST-Bad and then treated with either\nnocodazole, taxol, vincristine, or vinblastine. The phosphor-\nylation state of Bad in the mitotic and attached cell popula-\ntions was assessed by immunoblotting with phospo-specific\nBad antibodies, which specifically detect Bad phosphoryla-\ntion on serine 112 (S112), serine 136 (S136), or serine 155\n(S155). All four drug treatments induced an increase in the\nlevel of Bad phosphorylation on residues S116, S136, and\nS155 in the mitotically arrested cells in comparison with\neither the asynchronous or attached populations, although\nwe did not detect a mobility shift with GST-Bad (Figure 9B).\nTo determine whether one or more of the serine residues\nwas a specific target for PAK, we coexpressed GST-mBAD\nwith either DAPAK (L107F) or KDPAK (K298A) and then\nassessed the phosphorylation state of GST-mBad by immu-\nnoblotting. DAPAK did not seem to affect the phosphoryla-\ntion state of Bad on either S112 or S136. However, DAPAK\nincreased phosphorylation of Bad at S155 compared with\nbasal Bad phosphorylation at this site or when coexpressed\nwith KDPAK (Figure 9C). Furthermore, this phosphoryla-\ntion was abolished when S155 was replaced with alanine by\nsite-directed mutagenesis, confirming that PAK phosphory-\nlates mBad at this site. However, basal phosphorylation of\nBad (S155A) at S112 and S136 was still observed although its\nlevel was slightly reduced compared with wild-type Bad. To\nsuppress PAK activation we used GST-PAK (amino acids\n83\u2013149 of PAK1) an inhibitor of PAK1, PAK2, and PAK3\n(our unpublished data). Coexpression of GST-PAK (83\u2013149)\nwith GST-Bad reduced phosphorylation of Bad at S112,\nS136, and S155 (Figure 9D) in nocodazole-arrested mitotic\ncells. Expression of GST-PAK (83\u2013149) also sensitized no-\ncodazole-arrested mitotic cells to cell death over the time\ncourse examined compared with cells transfected with vec-\ntor alone (Figure 9E). Together, these results suggest that\nPAK phosphorylation of Bad may be a mechanism by which\nPAK contributes to cell survival in mitotically arrested cells.\nDISCUSSION\nWe have identified the signaling events associated with\nactivation of the spindle checkpoint by drugs that perturb\nmicrotubule dynamics. The results of this study demon-\nstrate that 1) chemotherapeutic drugs cause activation of\nboth p38 MAPK and PAK preferentially in the mitotically\narrested cells; 2) chemotherapeutic drug-induced cell death\nis mediated through p38 MAPK, whereas chemotherapeutic\ndrug-induced cell survival is mediated through PAK; 3) p38\nMAPK activity induces the translocation of the cell death\nactivator Bax, from the cytosol to the mitochondria; and 4)\nPAK phosphorylates Bad, thereby providing a mechanism\nto inhibit its proapoptotic function.\nOur data indicate that the mitotic checkpoint is activated\nin nocodazole-arrested cells as assessed by the presence of\nthe checkpoint protein MAD2 on the condensed chromatin.\nIn these mitotic checkpoint-arrested cells, we demonstrate\nfor the first time the concomitant activation of both p38\nMAPK and PAK. Activation of either p38 MAPK or PAK\nwas not observed in the attached cell population where both\nJNK and the Erk MAP kinases were found to be activated.\nThe function of either JNK or Erk in the attached population\nis currently unknown. However, our studies indicate that\nErk may suppress JNK-mediated cell death in this cell pop-\nulation (our unpublished data). Previous studies that have\nexamined chemotherapeutic drug-activated signaling path-\nways have reported activation of JNK, p38 MAPK and Erk\nMAP kinases either alone or in combination (Wang et al.,\n1998; Shtil et al., 1999; Subbaramaiah et al., 2000; McDaid and\nHorwitz, 2001; Okano and Rustgi, 2001; Seidman et al., 2001;\nStadheim et al., 2001). Discrepancies between the signaling\npathways that are activated by chemotherapeutic agents\nmay relate to the fact that these earlier studies did not\nseparate the mitotic and the nonmitotic cell populations. The\ndata presented in this study suggest that there is a remark-\nable divergence in the signaling pathways activated by an-\ntimicrotubule drugs in these two cell populations.\nThe upstream signaling events that lead to the activation\nof p38 MAPK and PAK during mitotic arrest remain to be\nidentified. Although it has been reported that PAKs can\nactivate p38 MAPK (Bagrodia et al., 1995), our data indicate\nthat p38 MAPK and PAK activation are likely to be inde-\npendent events. First, cotransfection of a DAPAK with p38\u0002\nFigure 7 (cont).\np38 MAPK, PAK, and Mitotic Arrest\nVol. 14, May 2003 2081\nFigure 8.

Second, p38 MAPK was\ninactivated before PAK, after release of cells from a mitotic\nblock, suggesting that PAK does not regulate the activation\nof p38 MAPK in mitotically arrested cells. We are currently\nexamining the upstream components of the p38 MAPK and\nPAK signaling pathways in mitotically arrested cells.\nThe downstream target(s) of p38 MAPK that cause cell\ndeath in the mitotically arrested cells are largely unknown.\nA recent observation (Ghatan et al., 2000) that p38 MAPK\ninduces apoptosis in neuronal cells by regulating the trans-\nlocation of Bax from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria led\nus to examine the effect of p38 MAPK on Bax in the mitot-\nically arrested cells. The translocation of Bax from the cyto-\nplasm to the mitochondria is both necessary and sufficient to\ninduce apoptotic cell death (Hsu et al., 1997; Wolter et al.,\n1997; Nechustan et al., 1999). Bax reduces mitochondrial\nmembrane potential, causes the release of cytochrome c from\nthe mitochondria and activates caspases (Xiang et al., 1996;\nEskes et al., 1998; Jurgensmeier et al., 1998; Desagher et al.,\n1999; Finucane et al., 1999). In this study we demonstrate,\nfirst, that DAMKK6 causes the translocation of Bax to mito-\nchondria, an effect that is reversed by the p38 MAPK inhib-\nitors. Second, we show that Bax also translocates to mito-\nchondria in the mitotically arrested cells and that the p38\nMAPK inhibitors are able to suppress nocodazole-induced\napoptosis. Therefore, our data support the conclusion that\nBax translocation to the mitochondria, and subsequent cell\ndeath, are regulated by p38 MAPK in the mitotically blocked\ncells. The mechanism by which p38 MAPK may affect the\ncellular distribution of Bax is currently under investigation.\nThe activation of PAK\u0002 by chemotherapeutic drugs in a\nmitotically arrested cell population has not been described\npreviously. We have shown in this study that DAPAK\u0002\nsuppresses MKK6-induced apoptosis, suggesting that one\nFigure 9 (cont). PAK phosphorylates\nthe proapoptotic protein Bad.

At least 100 GST-positive cells were\ncounted in randomly selected fields and the bars represent the mean \u0005 SEM of three independent experiments.\nK. Deacon et al.\nMolecular Biology of the Cell2084\nfunction of native PAK\u0002 may be to suppress cell death in the\nmitotically blocked cells. Indeed, our data have shown that\nexpression of DAPAK\u0002 confers a survival advantage during\nnocodazole-induced mitotic arrest, whereas inhibition of\nPAK activation enhances nocodazole-induced cell death. In\nmammalian cells PAK isoforms have been shown to play\ndistinct roles in apoptosis. Both PAK1 (PAK\u0002) and PAK4\nhave been shown to protect cells from apoptosis induced by\nserum withdrawal, UV irradiation, or tumor necrosis fac-\ntor-\u0002 in fibroblasts, or by growth factor withdrawal in lym-\nphoid cells (Schurmann et al., 2000; Tang et al., 2000; Gne-\nsutta et al., 2001), whereas a Xenopus PAK (X-PAK1) is\nrequired to suppress apoptosis during prophase arrest in\nfrog oocytes (Faure et al., 1997). However, \u0003PAK (PAK2)\nseems to have both an antiapoptotic and a proapoptotic\nfunction (Jakobi et al., 2001). The proapoptotic function of\n\u0003PAK has been attributed to the generation of constitutively\nactive fragment after caspase-mediated cleavage of \u0003PAK\n(Rudel and Bokoch, 1997). Although the activation of both\n\u0003PAK and PAK4 in mitotically arrested cells awaits investi-\ngation the results from the present study are consistent with\nreports demonstrating that PAK\u0002 mediates cell survival in\nresponse to diverse apoptotic stimuli.\nThe target(s) of PAK\u0002 that regulate cell survival in mitot-\nically blocked cells are also unknown. One mechanism\nthrough which PAK may protect lymphoid progenitor cells\nfrom apoptosis, after growth factor withdrawal, is by phos-\nphorylation of the BH3-only proapoptotic protein Bad\n(Schurmann et al., 2000). PAK is reported to phosphorylate\nBad on serine residues 112 and 136, thereby facilitating\nbinding to 14-3-3\u0006 and its sequestration in the cytoplasm.\nHowever, other prosurvival signals are also reported to\nphosphorylated Bad (Downward, 1999). For example, pro-\ntein kinase B phosphorylates Bad on serine residue 136,\nwhereas protein kinase A is reported to phosphorylate Bad\nat serine 112. Both serine residues 112 and 136 occur within\na protein kinase A phosphorylation motif (RRXS) in the BH3\ndomain of Bad that mediates its death-promoting activity\nthrough heterodimerization to the Bcl-XL family members\n(Tan et al., 2000). In this study, we report that Bad is phos-\nphorylated on serine residue 155 in addition to serine resi-\ndues 112 and 136 in the mitotically arrested cells. Serine\nresidue 155 also lies within the BH3 domain of Bad and is\nfound in the sequence motif RRXS (Tan et al., 2000) that is\nused by PAK to phosphorylate both serine residues 112 and\n136. In overexpression experiments, we have shown that\nDAPAK primarily phosphorylates S155 of Bad. Phosphory-\nlation of Bad at S155 is reported to induce cell survival by\npreventing the BH3-dependent dimerization of Bad with\nBcl-XL rather than promoting binding to 14-3-3 (Tan et al.,\n2000). Therefore, one mechanism by which cell death is\ninhibited in the mitotically arrested cells may be through\nphosphorylation of Bad by PAK at S155, thereby suppress-\ning the proapoptotic Bad-Bcl-XL dimerization. We have\nshown that inhibition of PAK in mitotically arrested cells\nsuppresses phosphorylation of Bad not only at S155 but also\nat S112 and S136 implying that native PAK is able to phos-\nphorylate all three sites in vivo.\nIn summary, the present study provides evidence that\nboth cell survival and cell death pathways are activated in\nmitotically arrested cells. A p38 MAPK-activated and Bax-\ndependent pathway contributes to cell death, whereas a\nPAK-activated and Bad-dependent pathway contributes to\ncell survival. The results of our study have implications for\nthe design of future chemotherapeutic drug therapies that\ntarget the mitotic checkpoint. In particular, the identification\nof other survival pathways that are activated in response to\nthe chemotherapeutic agents, and a search for agents that\nsuppress them may considerably increase the effectiveness\nof the current anticancer therapies.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Ed Manser, Roger Davis, Jiahuai Han, Gary Bokoch, and\nRichard Youle for generously providing various expression plas-\nmids.
