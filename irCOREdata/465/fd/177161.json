Our objective was to quantify quality of life and health utilities in the 5 years after\nintensive care discharge.\nMethods: A prospective longitudinal cohort study in a University Hospital in the UK. Quality of life was assessed\nfrom the period before ICU admission until 5 years and quality adjusted life years calculated.\nResults: 300 level 3 intensive care patients of median age 60.5 years and median length of stay 6.7 days, were\nrecruited. Physical quality of life fell to 3 months (P = 0.003), rose back to pre-morbid levels at 12 months then fell\nagain from 2.5 to 5 years after intensive care (P = 0.002). Mean physical scores were below the population norm at\nall time points but the mean mental scores after 6 months were similar to those population norms. The utility\nvalue measured using the EuroQOL-5D quality of life assessment tool (EQ-5D) at 5 years was 0.677. During the five\nyears after intensive care unit, the cumulative quality adjusted life years were significantly lower than that expected\nfor the general population (P < 0.001).\nConclusions: Intensive care unit admission is associated with a high mortality, a poor physical quality of life and a\nlow quality adjusted life years gained compared to the general population for 5 years after discharge. In this group,\ncritical illness associated with ICU admission should be treated as a life time diagnosis with associated excess\nmortality, morbidity and the requirement for ongoing health care support.\nIntroduction\nIntensive care management is associated with significant\nmorbidity and mortality as well as a huge health care\nexpenditure in developed countries [1,2]. Expenditure\nvaries markedly between developed countries and is\nmuch lower in under developed countries [1,2]. In\ndeveloped countries the hospital mortality for intensive\ncare unit (ICU) patients ranges from 16.5 to 32.5% [3].\nWith the high mortality in the first year after discharge,\nthere is now evidence to suggest that there is an\nongoing excess mortality associated with ICU admission,\nwhich continues for at least 15 years after discharge [4].\nThere is also an ongoing morbidity in this group with\nexisting evidence suggesting that quality of life before\nand after intensive care admission is generally poor\nwhen compared to population data [5-14]. These mor-\nbidities include high incidences of physical,\npsychological and cognitive dysfunction that are known\nto last for at least two years after ICU discharge [10-12].\nCurrently, there is a small and limited evidence base on\nthe cost-effectiveness of ICU care but the limited results\navailable suggest that ICU care may be cost-effective\n[12,13,15].\nDespite the increased attention given to the impor-\ntance of quality of life outcomes, many interventional\nstudies in critical care still prefer short-term mortality-\nbased outcomes as their primary outcomes, despite\nauthors stating that \u201cassessment of outcome after ICU\nstay must include quality of life measurements\u201d [16].\nNonetheless, only a small number of ICU-based out-\ncome studies use these measures and clinicians may be\nunfamiliar with the interpretation of these outcomes in\ntheir clinical practice [16]. There is little work looking\nat quality of life, health state utilities gained or quality\nadjusted life years (QALYs) beyond two years after dis-\ncharge from adult general ICU. Some of this work is in\nspecific patient groups, such as after a cardiac arrest\n* Correspondence: brian.cuthbertson@sunnybrook.ca\n1Department of Critical Care Medicine, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre,\n2075 Bayview Avenue, Toronto, M4N 3M5, Canada\nCuthbertson et al.

We\naimed to study measures of quality of life as well as\nhealth state utilities over the first five years after ICU\ndischarge and compare this to the general population.\nThus, our aim was to determine what happens to\nhealth-related quality of life and health state utilities\nover the five years after ICU discharge.\nMaterials and methods\nThe protocol was reviewed by the Hospital Research\nEthics Committee and the requirement for ethical\napproval was waived. Despite this written informed\nassent\/consent was obtained from all patients or their\nrelatives during ICU care and from all patients after\nthey regained competence. Patients were identified from\na cohort of patients admitted to the general ICU in a\nScottish tertiary referral teaching hospital of 900 beds\nexcluding transplant surgery. The hospital admits from\nan urban (about 50%) and rural (about 50%) population\nin the north of Scotland. The general 16 bed ICU\nadmits 820 patients per year with an average occupancy\nof 82%. The only other ICU in the hospital is a cardiac\nICU that cares for patients immediately after open car-\ndiac surgery. The unit has an Acute Physiology, Age and\nChronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II standardised\nmortality rate of 0.92 during this period. Patients were\nrecruited if they were expected to survive ICU care after\nstabilisation within the ICU as judged by clinicians\u2019\nassessment. This tended to be towards the end of the\nICU stay. Exclusions included failure to gain informed\nconsent and inability to speak English.\nPatient demographics and ICU data including\nAPACHE II score were calculated using standard meth-\nods. For the measurement of health-related quality of life\nwe used short form (SF)-36, which is extremely widely\nused in clinical practice. It has been demonstrated to\nhave acceptability, reliability and validity in the ICU\npopulation and has been validated by telephone interview\n[18-21]. The assessment of quality of life was performed\nusing a telephone assessment of SF-36 by two research\nnurses (with permission from Medical Outcome Trust,\nBoston, MA, USA) [19]. The two research nurses piloted\nthe interview technique in 20 patient telephone inter-\nviews. At the time of stabilisation after ICU admission,\nrelatives were asked to complete the SF-36 and instructed\nto comment on the patients\u2019 quality of life before their\ncurrent acute illness [19]. The patients completed SF-36\nquestionnaires at 3, 6, 12 months and then 2.5 and 5\nyears after ICU admission. Calculation of SF-36 physical\ncomponent score and mental component score were in\naccordance with the standard methods and differences in\nquality of life scores of five points are often considered\nclinically significant [19,21]. UK general population sta-\ntistics were used [22].\nWe also used another measure of health-related qual-\nity of life, the EuroQOL-5D quality of life assessment\ntool (EQ-5D). The responses to the EQ-5D are pre-\nsented as a health state utility that can subsequently be\nused to calculate QALYs. QALYs are a measure of dis-\nease burden that combines an assessment of length of\nlife with quality life and presents this as a single score.\nThe approach can be used to provide a measure of ben-\nefit and is the dominant method for measuring effective-\nness in economic evaluations. Whereas, the SF-36 is\nused to describe the quality of life of survivors at a\ngiven time point, the EQ-5D provides an estimate of life\nfor a whole cohort (both those that survive and those\nthat die) as a score of zero is assigned to a patient who\nhas died. Patient EQ-5D scores were estimated during\nICU care using standard tariffs for unconscious patients\nand assessed using EQ-5D at 12 months, 2.5 and 5 years\nafter ICU admission [23-25]. The responses to the EQ-\n5D were converted into a utility score using the stan-\ndard EQ-5D UK tariffs and QALYs were calculated\nacross the five years [25]. The tariff used to score\nresponses to the EQ-5D was estimated using data from\na large sample representative of the UK general popula-\ntion. EQ-5D scores were compared with a hypothetical\nage- and sex-matched cohort of the UK general popula-\ntion cohort using additional data provided by the sample\nof the UK population [25]. Patients were also asked to\ncomment on their satisfaction with their quality of life\nusing a four-point scale ranging from \u2018very happy\u2019 to\n\u2018very unhappy\u2019. Some of the early data from this paper\nhas been published previously [12].\nStatistics\nData are presented as means and standard errors of\nmeans or means and standard deviations (SD) as appro-\npriate. Data were analysed using SPSS\u2122 15 (SPSS Inc.,\nIBM Company Headquarters, 233 S. Wacker Drive, Chi-\ncago, USA). SF-36 data was analysed using standard ana-\nlytic techniques with comparison to UK normal data\n[19,21,22]. Comparisons across the time series was made\nusing paired student\u2019s t-tests of each stage against the\npre-morbid stage. Differences between subgroups at each\ntime point were compared using non-paired student\u2019s t-\ntests. The EQ-5D scores were calculated using the stan-\ndard SPSS syntax developed by the EuroQOL group [25].\nQALY were calculated from them using the area under\nthe curve method, using a score of zero at time points at\nwhich a patient was known to be dead. Parametric tests\nwere used to compare quality of life and satisfaction with\nquality of life data and for comparing EQ-5D scores from\nthe ICU cohort and an age- and sex-matched cohort\nfrom the general population. They were also used to\ncompare the QALYs for the survivors of ICU and the\ngeneral population to assess the burden of disease.\nCuthbertson et al. Critical Care 2010, 14:R6\nhttp:\/\/ccforum.com\/content\/14\/1\/R6\nPage 2 of 12\nMortality was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier\nmethod and a Cox\u2019s proportional hazards model was\nused to estimate the effect of patient characteristics\nupon survival. The model diagnostics showed nothing\nthat would cause doubt over the proportional hazards\nassumption. There was an appreciable amount of miss-\ning data with 35% (105 of 300) of patients lost to follow\nup after five years. Multiple imputation was used to\nexplore the robustness of the results. The physical com-\nponent score across all stages were imputed together,\nseparate from the mental component score. The mental\ncomponent score scores were imputed in the same way.\nBoth sets of scores had a monotone \u2018missingness\u2019 pat-\ntern i.e. once a participant had not responded to one\nquestionnaire they did not respond to any of the subse-\nquent questionnaires. Three methods of imputation\nwere explored, using PROC MI in SAS 9.1 (SAS, SAS\nInstitute Inc, Cary, NC, USA): predictive mean match\n[26] and the regression method [27] with two sets of\ncovariates. The first set was just the scores (either physi-\ncal component score or mental component score) at\neach stage; the second set added the baseline covariates\nage, APACHE II score and length of stay in ICU. In all\nthree methods values were imputed only for those miss-\ning due to loss to follow-up. No values were imputed\nfor those known to be dead at the time point. The dis-\ntributions of the physical component and mental com-\nponent scores in the imputed datasets were almost\nidentical to those of the observed data thus the observed\ndata alone is reported here.\nResults\nPatients\nTable 1 shows baseline demographics and outcomes for\nenrolled patients versus all general ICU patients for the\nsame period (May 2001 to April 2002). Figure 1 shows\nthe study recruitment and retention, death rates and loss\nto follow up at each time point up to five years. Due to\nthe requirement of the ethics committee no data is avail-\nable on the patients who refused consent. Figure 2 shows\na Kaplan-Meier survival estimate for study patients. The\nindependent predictors of death in this cohort were age\n(> 64 vs \u2264 64 years, hazard ratio (HR), 2.09, 95% confi-\ndence interval (CI) 1.37-3.17), APACHE II (> 18 vs \u2264 18\nHR 1.99, 95% CI 1.28-3.11); ICU length of stay (> 2 vs \u2264\n2 days HR 1.74, 95% CI 1.15-2.63); premorbid physical\ncomponent score (increase in one physical component\nscore point, HR 0.984, 95% CI 0.970-0.997) and premor-\nbid mental component score (increase in one mental\ncomponent score point HR 0.973, 95% CI 0.957-0.989).\nQuality of life\nTrends in quality of life with regard to the individual\ndimensions of SF-36 are presented in Table 2.

Regardless of comparisons\nto the general population, a five-year survival of 58% in\na cohort of patients who survive to leave ICU demon-\nstrates the extremely high mortality experienced by this\npatient group. We found age, severity of illness, ICU\nstay, and pre-morbid physical and mental quality of life\nscores to be independent predictors of mortality over\nfive years. Pre-morbid quality of life has been linked to\nhigher mortality and has been suggested to be as accu-\nrate a predictor of outcome as APACHE II system\n[32,34]. These findings are in keeping with previous\nstudy results and confirm the importance of pre-morbid\nquality of life on outcome from critical illness\n[31,32,35,36].\nChanges in quality of life over five years\nWe demonstrated a fall in physical aspects of quality of\nlife at three months after ICU discharge, followed by a\nslow and steady improvement over the first year after\nintensive care. Scores fell markedly between the 2.5-year\ntime point and the five-year time point. These trends are\nseen in physical component scores, SF-36 dimensions,\nEQ-5D scores and QALYs. The changes in quality of life\nover the first 2.5 years are in keeping with findings in\ngeneral ICU and ARDS cohorts previously [5-14]. The\nfall in physical component score between 2.5 and 5 years\n(mean falls by 3.6 points) in our cohort seems to be at a\ngreater rate than the general population whose mean\nphysical component score falls by approximately 1.5\npoints in five years [22]. These low quality of life scores\nare in keeping with the findings in studies of ARDS\npatients that found low physical quality of life scores at\nfive years [28-30]. Two of these studies were single time\npoint studies and therefore were unable to comment on\nthe direction of changes in quality of life over time or at\nthese longer time points [28,29]. However, our results are\nnot in keeping with another study in ARDS survivors,\nwhere quality of life was seen to increase over the five-\nyear follow-up period [30]. Differences between cohorts\ncould be explained by differences in age, differences in\nunderlying diagnosis, severity of illness, presence of co-\nmorbidities and other unmeasured differences in case\nmix. Different trends occur with regard to psychological\nquality of life scores. There is a rise in mental component\nscore between pre-morbid and three-month time points\nand it remains higher than pre-morbid levels for the\nentire five-year period. This may reflect underestimation\nof psychological quality of life by the next of kin [37,38],\nbut may also represent some form of \u2018cheated death\u2019 phe-\nnomena where patients score highly as a result of know-\ning they have survived severe illness. It is known that\nmental component score tends to increase with age in\nthe general population, although it would seem unlikely\nthat this effect could explain all the observed changes in\npsychological quality of life scores in our cohort. Previous\nwork in an ARDS cohort suggested that mental compo-\nnent scores can be similar to healthy controls but other\nwork disagrees [28,29]. It is difficult to explain high and\nnormal mental health scores in a population who are\nknown to experience high degrees of psychological\nFigure 5 Cumulative mean quality adjusted life year (QALYs) in ICU survivors up to five years after ICU discharge (solid line)\ncompared to normal population (dotted line).

Critical Care 2010, 14:R6\nhttp:\/\/ccforum.com\/content\/14\/1\/R6\nPage 8 of 12\nmorbidities in the years after discharge [9-12,39]. This\nmay suggest that the SF-36 mental health component\nscores are missing important aspects of health-related\nquality of life in this patient group that relate to mental\nhealth. It needs to be identified that changes in quality of\nlife scores may at times be statistically significant but\nwhether they are truly clinically significant is debateable\nin such a small and heterogenous group of critically ill\npatients.\nFactors affecting quality of life\nThe effect of age on quality of life after ICU discharge is\nvariable. Some studies found that despite low functional\nlevels that perceived quality of life was high [7,40,41].\nPerceived quality of life is also known to depend on the\nreference framework of the patients [42]. From our\nresults the only time point at which the physical scores\nare significantly lower in older patients is in the pre-\nmorbid period, although they again approached signifi-\ncance at the five-year time point. Patients under 65\nyears have poor pre-morbid physical scores when com-\npared with the normal UK population in other studies\nand suggests that these patients have a significant bur-\nden of ill-health before critical illness. Older patients\nactually seem to have higher mental scores than their\nyounger counterparts and although this may seem sur-\nprising it may be in keeping with normal data [21].\nFurther, it may be that older patients have lower expec-\ntations for quality of life after critical illness and there-\nfore do not score the metrics as low as younger patients.\nSatisfaction with quality of life\nSome studies report that despite poor objective scores,\npatients may be satisfied with their quality of life [43].\nWe asked about satisfaction and found that only 12% of\nour survivors were unsatisfied with their quality of life\nat five years but had significantly lower quality of life\nscores than patients who stated they were satisfied. This\nis in keeping with previous results and may be in keep-\ning with accommodation to long-term functional dis-\nability in this group, as is seen in other similar groups\n[32]. The small percentage of survivors who complain of\nlow satisfaction with quality of life may reflect low survi-\nval in the patients with lower satisfaction or poorer\nquality of life or an unwillingness to report poor satis-\nfaction with QOL.\nComparisons with the general population\nAt all time points at least 75% of physical component\nscores are lower than the population mean (50 points)\nrepresenting poor physical quality of life. The mean of\nthe mental component scores are below the population\nmean at the pre-morbid time point but rise to at least\nthe population mean after that time. Mean EQ-5D\nscores were significantly below the population mean for\nage- and sex-matched controls at 1 year, 2.5 years and 5\nyears. Again this is in keeping with the other quality of\nlife scores presented here and in other papers, although\nEQ-5D scores have not been recorded in this population\nup to five years before [43]. The plot of cumulative\nQALYs demonstrates that this group accumulates less\nthan half of the QALYs expected from the general\npopulation of the same age and sex composition over\nfive years and may contrast with previous data [13]. We\nbelieve that this data has not been published previously\nand is an important new finding that has implications\non the cost-effectiveness of ICU care [15,44]. A previous\ncost-effectiveness analysis of ICU care made assump-\ntions about survival and quality of life that can now be\nclarified in light of this and other new literature [15,45].\nThe authors assumed a normal life expectancy after five\nyears, which disagrees with our results and with recent\nevidence suggesting ongoing excess mortality for at least\n15 years and with our data [4]. They, and other\nresearchers, assumed a utility weight of 0.6 to 0.7 across\nthe remaining years of life and our results confirm that\na utility weight of 0.66 does persist across the five years\n[5,11-15]. Cost-effectiveness studies in severe sepsis in\nthe ICU setting have chosen to attribute the average\nquality-adjusted survival of the general population nor-\nmal of someone with the same life expectancy, which\nequalled an average utility of 0.68 [46]. Further studies\nchose 0.6 based on previous cohort studies, while others\ndid not specify a utility or QALY score [47,48]. Inaccu-\nrate estimates of utility, combined with inaccurate cost-\ning models will make cost-effective analysis in the ICU\npopulation of limited value.\nStrengths and limitations of the study\nStrengths of this study relate to the number of patients\nrecruited compared with previous studies and the\nassessment at multiple time points, including an evalua-\ntion of pre-morbid function along with five points in\nthe first five years after ICU care. Limitations include\nbeing a single-centre study although UK national audits\nsuggest that the case mix and outcomes for this unit are\nin line with UK practice [3]. However, it is well known\nthat ICUs in the UK admit patients later, with higher\nseverity of illness and experience higher mortality than\nin other systems [3]. Therefore, there is a limit to how\nwell this study can be generalised to practice in other\ncountries. This study includes patients expected to sur-\nvive ICU care after initial stabilisation and therefore\nthese results can only be applied to this cohort.\nOver the five years of the study, 35% of these patients\nwere lost to follow up. Although these patients were not\nregistered as dead on a national register of deaths, we\nwere unable to truly determine whether all of these\nCuthbertson et al. Critical Care 2010, 14:R6\nhttp:\/\/ccforum.com\/content\/14\/1\/R6\nPage 9 of 12\npatients were alive at the further follow up time points\nbecause they could have left Scotland. We have presented\na 67% measured mortality (58% using Kaplan-Meier sur-\nvival estimates) during the follow-up period and this is\nalso in line with expected mortality in a group of elderly\nICU patients in the years after critical illness. This leaves\na cohort of 32% of the patients who were available for\nfollow up at five years. We do not have reasons for loss\nto follow up and it is possible that the patients who with-\ndrew from this study did so because of poorer physical or\npsychological quality of life or due to severe cognitive\ndysfunction. However, it could also be theorised that\npatients who make a complete recovery from an episode\nof critical illness may be more likely to be lost to follow\nup because they may simply see the research as irrelevant\nto them. From our imputation we know that the profile\nof non-responders was not significantly different from\nresponders, which gives reassurance that the results seen\nare internally valid and that loss to follow up did not sig-\nnificantly impact the results.\nThe use of metrics such as SF-36 and EQ-5D in ICU\npopulations has limitations. It is known that many exist-\ning metrics were developed in other patient groups and\ntheir applicability and suitability to ICU patients can be\nquestioned [18]. Further to this it is unclear what an\nindividual score value for physical component score or\nmental component score actually means to the patient.\nAlthough we are unable to dissect this problem we did\nask the patient about their satisfaction with their current\nquality of life and it is clear that poor mental compo-\nnent score and physical component score are associated\nwith significantly lower satisfaction with quality of life.\nWe did not further explore contributors to their satis-\nfaction with quality of life. The use of relatives to assess\npre-morbid quality of life could be identified as a poten-\ntial weakness, the emergency nature of most ICU admis-\nsions makes the prospective identification of patients\nextremely difficult. The literature is variable on the\neffect of next-of-kin use from suggesting that it is not a\nmajor source of error to suggesting that next-of-kin\nunderestimate quality of life in their relatives [37,38,49].\nWe did not attempt to verify this pre-morbid quality of\nlife with the patient after ICU discharge but this also\ncould have the limitation of recall bias.\nConclusions\nIn this patient group, ICU admission is associated with a\nhigh mortality, a poor physical quality of life and a low\ncumulative QALY gain compared with the general\npopulation for at least five years after discharge. In this\ngroup critical illness associated with ICU admission\nshould be treated as a life time diagnosis with associated\nexcess mortality, morbidity and the requirement for\nongoing health care support.\nKey messages\n\u2022 Quality of life is poor compared with age- and sex-\nmatched controls before ICU admission.\n\u2022 Patients discharge from ICU alive have a high\nongoing mortality in the five years after discharge.\n\u2022 Quality of life is extremely poor compared with\nage- and sex-matched controls after ICU discharge\nfor the first year.\n\u2022 After recovering to levels consistent with age- and\nsex-matched controls, quality of life markedly dete-\nriorates between 2.5 and 5 years after ICU discharge.\n\u2022 In the five years after ICU admission patients accu-\nmulate QALYS at an extremely low rate compared\nwith age- and sex-matched controls.\nAbbreviations\nAPACHE II: acute physiology, age and chronic health evaluation II; ARDS:\nacute respiratory distress syndrome; CI: confidence interval; EQ-5D:\nEuroQOL-5D quality of life assessment tool; HR: hazard ratio; ICU: intensive\ncare unit; QALY: quality adjusted life years; SD: standard deviation; SF-36:\nShort Form 36.\nAcknowledgements\nWe acknowledge the data collection activity undertaken by Sally Hall (RN)\nand Heather Allan (RN) of the Intensive Care Unit, Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.\nThese individuals did not receive compensation for their work.
