Introduction20\nPower generation from fossil fuel-fired power plants is the largest single source of CO2 emissions [1]. Coal-fired power21\nplants release twice as much CO2 per unit of electricity generated than natural gas power plants. However, these power22\nplants play a vital role in meeting energy demands as coal is relatively cheap. In addition, coal-fired power plants can be23\noperated flexibly as mid-merit plants in response to changes in supply and demand [2]. With growing concerns about the24\nenvironmental impact of such plants effective CO2 emission abatement strategies such as Carbon Capture and Storage25\n(CCS) are required for their continued use. One approach to CCS is post combustion capture which involves the separation26\nof CO2 from the flue gas stream after combustion occurs (Figure 1). Chemical absorption is well suited for separating CO227\nfrom streams with low concentration of CO2 (10-15% by volume) typical of pulverized fuel power plants [3,4].28\n1.1 Motivation29\n* Corresponding author. Tel.: +0044 1234 754655; Fax: +0044 1234 754685; Email address: meihong.wang@cranfield.ac.uk\n2Several studies have shown that the energy requirement for solvent regeneration would have adverse effects on power plant30\nefficiency [5-8]. These effects have been studied using various steady state models and techno-economic assessments.31\nHowever there are several gaps in the understanding of the impact of post combustion capture on the operability of the32\npower plant. For instance, would such power plants be able to effectively operate at varying loads? What modifications33\nwould have to be made to the conventional start-up and shutdown procedures? What implications would heat integration34\nbetween the power plant and CO2 capture facility have on their operation [9]? These questions can be addressed by35\nstudying the dynamic behaviour of such plants. To achieve this, accurate dynamic models of the power plant and the CO236\ncapture facility are required.37\n1.2. Post combustion capture via chemical absorption38\nChemical absorption involves the reaction of CO2 with a chemical solvent to form a weakly bonded intermediate39\ncompound which may be regenerated with the application of heat producing the original solvent and a CO2 stream [3,4].40\nMonoethanolamine (MEA) being a primary amine reacts with CO2 to produce carbamate via sets of liquid phase reactions41\n[7,10]. A review of various reaction schemes describing this process is available in literature [11,12].42\nFigure 1 describes one of the popular technologies proposed for post combustion capture. The facility consists of two main43\nunits \u2013 the absorber and stripper columns which are both packed columns. Flue gas from the power plant is contacted44\ncounter-currently with lean MEA solution in the absorber. MEA chemically absorbs the CO2 in the flue gas. This leaves a45\ntreated gas stream of much lower CO2 content. The solvent solution (now Rich MEA) is regenerated in the stripper column46\nusing steam derived from the power generation process. CO2 from the top of the column is compressed and transported47\naway while the lean (regenerated) MEA solution is returned to the absorber column completing the cycle.48\n1.3 Novel contributions and outline of the paper49\nThis study focuses on the dynamic model development of the absorber of the chemical absorption plant. It offers what is50\nthought to be a unique comparison of the accuracy of two approaches to modelling the absorption process\u2013 the51\nequilibrium-based and rate-based approaches. Also dynamic analyses of some disturbances to the absorber performance52\nwere carried out. Two disturbances were considered:53\n\uf0b7 Decreasing flue gas flow supplied to the absorber from the upstream power plant, and54\n\uf0b7 Increasing the CO2 loading of the lean MEA solution from the stripper of the capture facility.55\nA review of various approaches to modelling the chemical absorption process is described in section 2. Two approaches56\nwere compared \u2013 the equilibrium and rate-based approaches. The model development process was described in section 3.57\nThese models were validated with results from a pilot plant study [13] in section 4. Two dynamic scenarios were simulated58\n3\u2013 reducing power plant load and increasing CO2 loading of the lean solvent. The results are presented in section 5.59\nConclusions were drawn in section 6 and recommendations for future work were given in section 7.60\n2. Developments in modelling chemical absorption of CO261\nPost combustion capture with MEA is a reactive absorption process. Two main phenomena are involved: mass transfer of62\nCO2 from the bulk vapour to the liquid solvent and the chemical reaction between CO2 and the solvent.63\nA number of studies have employed steady state models of the chemical (or reactive) absorption process at different levels64\nof complexity. Kenig et al describes the different levels of complexity of these models as illustrated in Figure 2 [14].65\nThe equilibrium stage models assume theoretical stages in which liquid and vapour phases attain equilibrium. These66\nmodels may assume the reactions are at equilibrium or may consider the reaction kinetics. The rate-based approach is more67\nappropriate in modelling reactive absorption processes since phase equilibrium is hardly attained in practice. At its lowest68\nlevel of complexity, the chemical reactions of the rate-based model are assumed to be at equilibrium. A more rigorous69\napproach involves the inclusion of an enhancement factor to estimate actual absorption rates (with chemical reactions)70\nfrom known physical absorption rates. The enhancement factor is calculated based on estimated reaction rates and is best71\nsuited for processes involving single irreversible reactions. This approach has been employed by a number of authors in72\ndeveloping steady state absorber and stripper models [15-17]. At the highest level available, reaction kinetics are modelled73\ndirectly. Models consider mass transfer resistances, electrolyte thermodynamics, the reaction system as well as the column74\nconfigurations and provide a direct estimation of concentration and temperature profiles by implementing reaction rates75\ndirectly into the transport and balance equations in the film and the bulk of the fluid. This approach has been applied to a76\nnumber of cases [10,14,18,19].77\nThis study compares the equilibrium stage with the rate-based models both with reaction equilibrium (bottom and top left78\nmodels in Figure 2).79\nThe dynamic behaviour of the CO2 absorption process for post combustion capture using MEA has not been extensively80\nstudied. Schneider et al considered the dynamic simulation of purification of coke plant gases [18]. Kvamsdal et al81\nconsidered the dynamic simulation of only the absorber of the process using dynamic models of reduced complexity. The82\nmodel employs an enhancement factor based on the assumption of pseudo first-order reaction regime. Kvamsdal et al83\nadjusted both inlet flue gas flow rates and absorber heights to match pilot plant performance. In this study only the inlet84\nflue gas flow rates to the absorber were adjusted. Kvamsdal et al also assumed a constant value for the heat of reaction and85\nvaporization of water [9].86\n3. Model development87\nThis section describes the model development of the absorber using the equilibrium- and rate-based approaches.88\n43.1. Equilibrium-based approach89\nThe equilibrium-based approach was implemented in Aspen Plus1 based on its Radfrac column model. This model was90\nsteady state and assumes theoretical stages in which liquid and vapour phases attain equilibrium and perfect mixing occurs.91\nTo describe non-equilibrium processes, the performance of each stage is adjusted using an efficiency correction factor92\n[17,18]. For simulation purposes, the specifications presented in Table 1 were used. In section 4, all equilibrium based93\nresults were obtained from Aspen Plus.94\nThe physical property method used is the Electrolyte Non-random-two-liquid (NRTL) model with electrolyte inserts for95\nMEA. This insert includes new parameters and Henry\u2019s constant for CO2 in MEA.96\n3.1.1. Aspen Properties MEA solution chemistry97\nMEA electrolyte solution chemistry is used to predict the equilibrium mass fractions in the liquid and vapour phases.

Rate-based approach105\nIn the rate-based approach, actual rates of multi-component mass and heat transfer as well as chemical reactions are106\nconsidered directly [21]. The mass transfer is described using the two-film theory using the Maxwell Stefan formulation.107\nHeat and mass transfer resistances are modelled in the liquid and vapour films.108\nThe rate-based model was developed from the Gas-Liquid Contactor model in Process Systems Enterprise\u2019s Advanced109\nModel Library using their process modelling tool, gPROMS. With gPROMS, accurate dynamic models of processes can be110\ndeveloped as it is equation-based and inherently dynamic.111\n3.2.1.

The diffusivity (\u03c7) of CO2 in the liquid phase140\nwas based on expressions provided by Vaidya et al [23]. The diffusivity (\u03c7) of CO2 and other components in the vapour141\nphase was estimated using the Fuller\u2019s equation [24].

Physical properties147\nThe physical property estimation models were set up in Aspen Properties. Through the CAPE-OPEN Thermo interface,148\ngPROMS can take advantage of Aspen Properties\u2019 extensive physical property database. The Electrolyte-NRTL properties149\nmethod was selected. For simplicity, only four main components were considered \u2013 MEA, water, carbon dioxide and150\nnitrogen (oxygen content was incorporated into the nitrogen composition). Aspen properties also includes electrolyte151\ninserts for the Electrolyte-NRTL property method where electrolyte solution chemistry is accounted for [20]. The same152\nphysical property model was used in the equilibrium- based model was used here as well.153\nMEA electrolyte solution chemistry is used to predict the equilibrium mass fractions in the liquid and vapour phases at the154\ninterface. The same set of equilibrium reactions described in equations (1-5) is used.155\n4. Model validation156\nThe models developed were validated using data from the Separations Research Program at the University of Texas at157\nAustin. The absorber column of the pilot plant is a packed column with a diameter of 0.427m and total height of 6.1m. This158\ncolumn consists of two 3.05m packed bed sections with a collector plate and redistributor between the beds [13]. Out of the159\n48 experimental cases carried out in the research program, two cases (Cases 32 and 47) were selected for steady state160\nvalidation purposes. These two cases were selected because of their relatively high and low liquid to gas (L\/G) ratios161\nrespectively.162\nTable 2 shows the process conditions for the lean MEA and flue gas streams to the absorber while Table 3 shows some163\nabsorber column and packing specifications.164\nSimulation results were validated using the temperature profile of the absorber column measured in the pilot plant [13]. In165\naddition the measured CO2 loading of the amine solvent taken at different positions was compared with values obtained166\nfrom simulation.167\n74.1 Validation and comparison of equilibrium- and rate-based models168\n4.1.1. Case 47169\nThis case involved a relatively low liquid to gas (L\/G) ratio thus a lower CO2 capture level.170\nBecause of the reported inaccuracy in the flue gas flow measurement [9,13], its value was adjusted to match reported171\ncapture levels as shown in Table 4. Both the equilibrium and rate-based models predicted lower rich solvent loading than172\nwhat was measured while the absorption levels are virtually the same as measured.173\nThe temperature profile in the absorber was used to validate the two models as shown in Figure 4. The rate-based model174\ngives a slightly better prediction of the temperature profile. The equilibrium-based model predicts generally lower175\ntemperatures than what was measured.176\n4.1.2. Case 32177\nThis case involved a relatively high liquid to gas (L\/G) ratio thus a high CO2 capture level.178\nBoth models showed poor prediction of the temperature profile in the absorber. However, with further reduction in the inlet179\nflue gas rate to 0.11kg\/s, better predictions were observed as shown in Figure 6. However, this change implies higher CO2180\ncapture levels than what was measured in the pilot plant (Table 5).181\nThese discrepancies (as seen in Table 6) may be due to the assumption that the reactions between CO2 and MEA are at182\nequilibrium as calculated by the electrolyte solution chemistry. Kinetically controlled reactions may therefore provide183\nbetter predictions of the trend. The rate-based model still gives a better prediction of the absorber temperature profile184\n(Figure 6) compared to the equilibrium based model. The equilibrium-based model predicts higher temperatures than those185\nmeasured in the pilot plant study.186\n5. Dynamic analysis187\nThese analyses consider the effect of disturbances on the performance of the absorber. Two scenarios are considered:188\n\uf0b7 Reducing power plant load \u2013 as a mid-merit power plant, power generation would not be continuously at base-189\nload level. In this scenario, a 50% reduction in power plant load occurs.190\n\uf0b7 Increasing lean MEA solution loading \u2013 with disturbances in the stripper column operation, such as reduced191\nreboiler duty, the CO2 loading of the lean MEA supplied to the absorber may increase. This scenario involves a192\n10% increase in lean loading.193\n5.1 Reducing power plant load194\nIn this scenario, the upstream power plant load was reduced from base-load (100%) to 50% load. It was assumed that the195\nflue gas flow rate decreases correspondingly and the changes in component composition are negligible. This scenario was196\napplied to Case 32. Two cases were considered:197\n8\uf0b7 Case-A: Change of flue gas flow rate without changing liquid (solvent) flow rate198\n\uf0b7 Case-B: Change of flue gas flow rate with corresponding decrease in liquid solvent rate to maintain CO2 capture199\nlevel200\nThe process was simulated with the base-load conditions (Case 32) for three minutes after which the above changes were201\nimplemented in ten minutes. Finally conditions were maintained for eight minutes.202\nThe two cases are illustrated in Figures 7203\n5.1.1 Case-A204\nFrom Figure 8, the 100s curve represents the profile before dropping load. The other curves show a trend of increasing205\nabsorption levels with time. Since the flue gas flow rate is ramped down with time while the solvent flow rate is constant,206\nan increase in L\/G ratio occurs.207\nFigure 9 shows the change in the CO2 absorption level as the flue gas leaves the absorber with the L\/G ratio. CO2208\nabsorption levels increase almost linearly with L\/G ratio up to ratios of about 8.0. Afterwards, the rate of increase reduces.209\nThere is also a significant change in the temperature profile in the absorber as seen in Figure 10. The location of the210\ntemperature bulge gradually shifts toward the bottom of the column. Temperature values generally reduce as less quantities211\nof CO2 are absorbed.212\n5.1.2 Case-B213\nBy reducing the lean solvent feed rate correspondingly (by 50%), roughly the same capture level and temperature profile214\n(Figures 11 and 12) could be maintained through the period of change. This suggests that the absorption process is more215\nsensitive to the L\/G (liquid solvent to flue gas) ratio than their actual flow rates. Since the amount of steam required for216\nregeneration corresponds to the amount of lean MEA circulated, the energy requirement of the stripper could be217\ncorrespondingly reduced.218\n5.2 Increasing lean MEA solution loading219\nThis scenario was applied to Case 32 (process conditions in Table 2). Conditions were maintained for three minutes. Then220\nthe CO2 loading of the lean solution was ramped up by 10% (from 0.279 to 0.3069) within three minutes. Finally,221\nconditions were then maintained for 30 minutes to achieve steady state. This is illustrated in Figure 13.222\nWith increased CO2 loading of the lean MEA supplied to the absorber, the CO2 absorption level (Figure 14) drops from223\n94.4% to 85.5%. CO2 absorption levels could be maintained by either increasing the flow rate of lean MEA solvent to the224\nabsorber or decreasing the CO2 loading of the solvent. The latter can be achieved by either increasing the stripper\u2019s reboiler225\nduty or adding fresh MEA solution from solvent makeup tanks. Increasing the total solvent flow rate by 10% only results226\n9in a capture level of 92.3%. Figure 15 shows that the temperature profile in the column is also affected by this change. The227\ntemperature bulge moves towards the bottom of the column.228\n6. Conclusions229\nThis paper presents a study of the CO2 capture with MEA based on the dynamic modelling of the process. Two models230\n(equilibrium- and rate-based models) have been developed and compared. The rate-based approach yielded better231\npredictions compared with the equilibrium-based approach.232\nDynamic analyses of dropping the upstream power plant load and the effect of increasing CO2 loading in the lean solvent233\nwere carried out. Simulation results reveal that the absorber operation is more sensitive to the L\/G ratio than the actual flow234\nrates of the solvent and the flue gas. Increased CO2 loading in the lean solvent resulted in significant reduction in absorber235\nperformance.236\n7. Future work237\nIt has been shown that the rate-based mass transfer model improves the predictions of the absorption process compared to238\nthe equilibrium based model. Another rate controlling factor is the reaction chemistry. The kinetics of the chemical239\nabsorption process would be improved by replacing the set of equilibrium reactions in the interface by kinetic and240\nequilibrium reactions in the liquid film (top right model in Figure 2). This should give a better prediction of the absorption241\nrates.242\nThe stripper column model would subsequently be developed and the entire CO2 capture facility model would be linked to243\na coal-fired power plant model for whole plant analyses.244\nReferences245\n[1] Freund P.
