This study is based on measurements of trapped\nand precipitated electrons of energy >30 keV and >100 keV\nobserved by polar orbiting environmental satellites during\noverpasses of the imaging riometer at Kilpisja\u00a8rvi, Finland.\nThe satellites are in sun-synchronous orbits of about 850 km\naltitude, recording the electron fluxes at 2-s time resolu-\ntion. The riometer measures the radiowave absorption at\n38.2 MHz, showing the spatial pattern within a 240 km field\nof view.\nThe analysis has focussed on two areas. Having found a\nclose correlation between the radiowave absorption and the\nmedium-energy electron fluxes during satellite overpasses,\nempirical relationships are derived, enabling one quantity to\nbe predicted from the other for three sectors of local time. It\nis shown that small-scale variations observed during a pass\nare essentially spatial rather than temporal.\nOther properties, such as the spectra and the relation be-\ntween precipitated and trapped components, are also consid-\nered in the light of the theory of pitch angle scattering by\nVLF waves. It is found that the properties and behaviour\ndepend strongly on the time of day. In the noon sector, the\nprecipitated and trapped fluxes are highly correlated through\na square law relationship.\nKeywords.

Hargreaves\n(j.hargreaves@lancaster.ac.uk)\n1 Introduction\nEver since auroral radio absorption was identified as a dis-\ntinct phenomenon (Reid and Collins, 1959) \u2013 though they\ndescribed it as predominantly a night-time occurrence and\nattributed it to increased collision frequency in the E-region\n(both erroneous!) \u2013 there has been interest in relating the ab-\nsorption effects to the incoming energetic particles causing\nthem: to identify the nature of the particles and their energy;\nto determine the height of the absorption which depends on\nthe energy; to be able to predict one quantity from the other;\nand to learn the physics involved.\nMaehlum and O\u2019Brien (1963) and McDiarmid et\nal. (1963) raised statistical arguments based on the occur-\nrence and location of auroral absorption and of energetic\nelectron precipitation detected by the low-orbit satellites In-\njun I and Alouette I, to argue that the latter was likely to\nbe the cause of the former. The first direct connection was\ndemonstrated by Jelly et al. (1964) using measurements of\n>40 keV electrons on the early Canadian satellite Alouette I\nwhen passing over, or close to, the field of view of wide-beam\nriometers operating at, or near to, 30 MHz. They reported\nabsorption exceeding 0.2 dB when the precipitated flux ex-\nceeded 2\u00d7104 cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 and, assuming the absorption\n(A) to be proportional to the square root of the flux (J ), they\nderived the relationships\nA= 4\u00d710\u22123\u221aJ (1)\nA= 2\u00d710\u22123\u221aJ (2)\nfor day and night respectively. The difference was attributed\n(wrongly, it is now thought) to photodetachment in the sunlit\nD-region of the ionosphere.\nUnlike Alouette I, the US satellite Injun III was able\nto measure the precipitated and trapped components of the\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n1108 J. K. Hargreaves et al.: Fine structure of medium energy electron fluxes in the auroral zone\nelectron flux simultaneously. Parthasarathy et al. (1966) ob-\nserved that the trapped flux was usually greater than the pre-\ncipitated component by a factor of 10 to 100, and the pitch-\nangle distribution only approached isotropy when the inten-\nsity was high. Taking day and night observations together\nthey related 30 MHz absorption and >40 keV precipitated\nflux by\nA= 3.3\u00d710\u22123\u221aJ (3)\nwhich agrees well with the Jelly et al. results.\nSome comparisons have been made between the ab-\nsorption detected with riometers and the electron fluxes at\ngeosynchronous orbit (Baker et al., 1981; Collis et al., 1983).\nThis configuration has the advantage of continuity at a sin-\ngle location and the spectral resolution may be good, but the\nmagnetic conjugacy between the satellite and ground station\nmay be uncertain, there is no information about the spatial\ndistribution of the particles, and the loss cone (which is very\nnarrow at the equator) may be smaller than the reception cone\nof the detector for precipitated particles.\nThe present study returns to comparisons with low-orbit\ndata, concentrating on short-term variations of electron flux\ndetected at about 850 km altitude, while the satellite passes\nthrough the field of view of an imaging riometer show-\ning spatial detail within the absorption patch. We consider\n(i) short-term variation of the electron flux, (ii) detailed em-\npirical relationships between the fluxes and the variation of\nradio absorption during overpasses of the imaging riometer,\n(iii) interpretation of the results in relation to the theory of\npitch-angle scattering, and (iv) time of day variations, includ-\ning change of spectrum.\n2 Observations and data\nThe NOAA polar orbiting environmental satellites (POES)\nare in sun-synchronous orbits of 90 min period at altitude\n850 km. Their instrumentation (Evans and Greer, 2004) in-\ncludes the Medium Energy Proton and Electron Detectors\n(MEPED) from which we shall be concerned with the fluxes\nof electrons in the energy bands 30\u20132500 keV and 100\u2013\n2500 keV. Each satellite carries two identical solid state de-\ntector telescopes, one pointing almost vertically and the other\nhorizontally, each having a reception cone of 30\u25e6 diameter.\n(There is actually a 9\u25e6 offset in each case so that the field of\nview is clear of spacecraft structure.)\nAt high latitudes the \u201cvertical\u201d telescope points at an an-\ngle to the geomagnetic field which depends on the satellite\u2019s\nlatitude and longitude. For our purposes we take an average\nvalue of 17\u25e6. At 850 km this telescope collects precipitating\nelectrons that would penetrate to the atmosphere. The \u201chor-\nizontal\u201d telescope points at an average angle of 78\u25e6 or 102\u25e6\nto the field, depending on the position of the spacecraft in the\norbit. This observes trapped electrons which would mirror\nbefore reaching the atmosphere.\nThe geometric factor for converting the count rate (C, s\u22121)\nto flux (F , cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121) is 100. Each of the telescopes pro-\nvides count rates for the energy bands stated above. We shall\nrefer to these as the \u201c30 keV\u201d and \u201c100 keV\u201d rates respec-\ntively, it being understood that they are integral rates above\nthe threshold.\nOverpasses of POES satellites across a 240 km square\ncentred on Kilpisja\u00a8rvi, Finland (69.05\u25e6 N, 20.79\u25e6 E, L=5.9)\nwere selected for comparison with the radio-wave absorp-\ntion observed with the 38.2 MHz imaging riometer at that\nsite (Browne et al., 1995). In each of the energy ranges the\nelectrons are counted for one-second periods from each tele-\nscope alternately. Thus the time resolution is 2 s in each case.\nDuring an overpass the number of samples taken was gener-\nally 18 to 20, giving a spatial resolution of about 12 km over\nthe ground. The data used in the study are from the satel-\nlites NOAA-12 and NOAA-14 between late 1994 and early\n1996, and comprise 54 selected overpasses which fall into\nthree local time groups.\n3 Rapid variations of flux\nSamples of the precipitated and trapped count rates from the\n30 keV and 100 keV counters are shown in Fig. 1. It is note-\nworthy that at the same energy the precipitated flux is almost\ninvariably less than the trapped, but the relative variations\nfrom point to point are considerably larger. Some passes\nseem to show quasi-periodic variation with a period of 5 or 6\nsamples i.e. 10 to 12 s in time, or 60 to 72 km in distance. The\npatterns of variations are similar for the 30 keV and 100 keV\nparticles.\nThe amount of variability depends on the time of day.\nFigure 2 gives statistics of the maximum point-to-point\nchange of flux (as a ratio) observed during each overpass,\ndivided into three time groups (\u223c01:00 UT, \u223c07:00 UT and\n\u223c11:00 UT) according to the satellite orbits. In local time the\ngroups can be taken to represent night (\u223c02:30 LT), morning\n(\u223c08:30 LT) and noon (\u223c12:30 LT). These groups comprise\n10, 31 and 13 passes, respectively, each of which crosses the\nlatitude of Kilpisja\u00a8rvi within 5\u25e6 of longitude. It is clear that\nthe trapped flux seldom varies by more than a factor of 3 be-\ntween samples, and in half the cases by less than a factor of\n2. On the other hand, the variability of the precipitated flux\nis larger and depends on the local time. In the morning group\nthe maximum point-to-point change can exceed a factor of\n100, and in half the cases exceeds a factor of 45 at 30 keV or\n25 at 100 keV.\nThe statistics are summarised in more detail in Table 1.\nThese again refer to the maximum change from point to point\nduring each overpass, and they are divided according to time\nof day, energy, and whether trapped or precipitated. Median\nvalues are given (from Fig. 2), and also the percentage of\npoints for which the maximum ratio \u201c\u22642\u201d (for the trapped\nAnn.

The following conclusions are noted:\n1. In the case of the trapped fluxes, the maximum point-\nto-point change during an overpass is generally small,\nthe median being less than a factor of 2. Values greater\nthan 3 are rare. The values are somewhat smaller in the\nmorning group than those at night or at noon.\n2. The maximum point-to-point changes in the morning\ngroup are generally much greater in the precipitated flux\nthan in the trapped, 60\u201370% of values being between\nfactors 10 and 100. The factor 100 was exceeded in\n16% of the overpasses. The results are similar for 30\nand 100 keV.\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/28\/1107\/2010\/ Ann. Geophys., 28, 1107\u20131120, 2010\n1110 J. K.

The distribution of absorption (in decibels) at 90 km altitude for the time of the overpasses by (a) NOAA-12 from 07:16:35 to\n07:17:08 UT on day 125 (5 May), and (b) NOAA-14 from 01:41:27 to 01:42:00 on day 35 (4 February), both in 1995, observed using the\nKilpisja\u00a8rvi imaging riometer. Also shown, in black, is the projected track of the satellite.\nBy taking the maximum change of flux over any 2-s interval\nduring the pass we are effectively selecting just the great-\nest variations within a time of about 40 s in each case. It\nis clear, nevertheless, that there are significant differences in\nthe fine-scale structure between the trapped and the precip-\nitated components of the electron flux, and that the magni-\ntude of this effect depends on the time of day. The precip-\nitated flux invariably changes more than the trapped com-\nponent, and the variations are largest in the morning sector\n(\u223c08:30 LT) and least at noon (\u223c12:30 LT). However, these\nproperties are very similar for the >30 keV and >100 keV\nfluxes, indicating that no significant change of spectrum oc-\ncurs during these rapid variations.\n4 Relations between radio absorption and particle flux.\n4.1 Data from the whole day\nThe imaging riometer at Kilpisja\u00a8rvi measures the absorp-\ntion of the cosmic radio noise at 38.2 MHz within a region\nof about 240 km north-south and east-west, assuming that\nthe absorption occurs in the ionospheric D-region at altitude\n90 km. The system forms 49 beams from which a spatial\ndistribution may be obtained by interpolation. Figure 3 (a\nand b) shows the distributions of absorption (in decibels)\nobtained for the times of the overpasses by (a) NOAA-12\nfrom 07:16:35 UT to 07:17:08 UT on day 125 (5 May), and\n(b) NOAA-14 from 01:41:27 to 01:42:00 on day 35 (4 Febru-\nary), both in 1995. The satellite tracks projected to 90 km\naltitude are marked in black. An absorption value was then\nobtained for each 2-s interval along the track, and these are\nshown (plotted as absorption squared) in Fig. 4 with the pre-\ncipitated and trapped fluxes observed on the satellite. Fig-\nure 5 shows the evolution of the absorption patterns at 30-s\nresolution for 5-min periods centred on the time of the over-\npasses.\nTwo significant facts are immediately evident. Since the\noverall absorption pattern changes relatively little during a\nperiod of several minutes, the variations of particle flux ob-\nserved during an overpass (which lasts only about 40 s) must\nbe spatial rather than temporal. The continuity equation ap-\npropriate to the D-region, q =\u03b1e N2e (where q is the ion pro-\nduction rate, \u03b1e is the effective recombination coefficient,\nand Ne is the equilibrium electron density), indicates that the\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/28\/1107\/2010\/ Ann.

It appears from\nFig. 4 that the square of the absorption is more nearly pro-\nportional to the trapped flux than to the precipitated. This\napparent anomaly will be considered later.\nTwelve overpasses were selected as a subset of those used\nin the previous section, four in the night sector, five in the\nmorning, and three near noon, the criteria being (i) that\nthe satellite\u2019s position, projected to 90 km altitude, crossed\nthe latitude of Kilpisja\u00a8rvi within 2\u25e6 of longitude of the sta-\ntion, and (ii) that the 38.2 MHz absorption on the wide-beam\nriometer at the site was at least 1 dB. The ratio between\nthe >80 keV proton telescope count rate and the coincident\n>30 keV electron telescope count rate indicates whether or\nnot the electron measurements are contaminated by signifi-\ncant response to energetic protons and should be discarded.\nUsing this additional criterion two passes were rejected, one\nin the noon sector and one at night, leaving the selection\nshown in Table 2. Included is the Kp index for the 10\npasses, which shows that the corresponding geomagnetic ac-\ntivity was moderate, ranging from 3+ to 5+.\nScatter plots of absorption against electron count rate from\nthe precipitated and trapped detectors are given in Fig. 6 (a\nand b), all 10 passes being included. Regression lines are su-\nperimposed for absorption against count rate, and for count\nrate against absorption, as are the trends corresponding to the\ntheoretical square law. Detailed results from the regression\nanalysis are given in Table 3. Using these equations the ab-\nsorption could be estimated from the particle flux to an accu-\nracy of a factor of about 1.4, and the flux from the absorption\nto better than a factor of 2 or 3. These factors are the standard\nerrors, which would contain about 70% of estimates.\nTable 4 gives relationships between electron pitch angles\nat the equator (L=5.9), at altitude 850 km, and at 90 km\n(a typical height for the absorption layer), according to the\nfirst invariant (magnetic flux) for trapped particles. The flux\nreaching 90 km has pitch angles between 0\u25e6 and 3.24\u25e6 at\nthe equator, a range which goes beyond the outer limit for\nthe precipitated detector (2.03\u25e6) but does not quite reach the\ncoverage of the trapped detector (3.42\u25e6 to 3.84\u25e6). This sug-\ngests that a better measure of the flux reaching 90 km might\nbe achieved by taking account of the readings from both de-\ntectors, and Fig. 6c shows the plot of absorption against the\ngeometric mean of the precipitated and trapped count rates.\nRegression analysis details are included in Table 3. The cen-\ntral line of this distribution, the geometric mean of the two\nregression lines, has a gradient of 0.46.\nAnn. Geophys., 28, 1107\u20131120, 2010 www.ann-geophys.net\/28\/1107\/2010\/\nJ.

The rate of\ndeposition into the atmosphere depends on the rate at which\ntrapped electrons diffuse into the loss cone (from which, by\ndefinition, they are lost to the atmosphere at the next bounce),\nand this is governed by a \u201cdiffusion parameter\u201d\n\u221a\nD\u03c4 , where\nD is a diffusion coefficient and \u03c4 is related to the bounce\ntime of a particle between hemispheres. The mechanism\nrelies on a resonance between the gyrating electrons and\nthe Doppler-shifted whistler-mode waves which they emit.\nThe waves may have been generated in the same flux tube\nas those being affected, or have come in from elsewhere.\nThorne (1972) calls these cases \u201cunstable\u201d and \u201cparasitic\u201d,\nAnn.

Figure 7 shows the dependence of the flux\non equatorial pitch-angle and diffusion parameter under this\nmechanism. By observing the ratio between the trapped and\nprecipitated fluxes, in our case corresponding to equatorial\npitch-angles 1.12\u25e6 and 3.76\u25e6 (see Table 4), it should be pos-\nsible to estimate values for the diffusion parameter, as shown\nin Fig. 8.\nValues for the ratio of precipitated to trapped count rates\nare plotted against A2 in Fig. 9 for the 10 Kilpisja\u00a8rvi over-\npasses at 2-s intervals, divided according to the night, morn-\ning and noon sectors. The median and quartile values for\neach interval, with corresponding diffusion parameters de-\nrived from Fig. 8, are given in Table 6. The distribution\nof ratios for the morning period (Fig. 9b) has groups of\npoints of low value seemingly separated from the main dis-\ntributions. These would appear to correspond to the large,\nshort-duration reductions of precipitated flux noted previ-\nously. Median values of the count rate ratio and correspond-\ning diffusion parameters are included in Table 6. The inter-\nquartile range is no more than a factor of 2 for the morning\nand noon data, though considerably more at night. The cor-\nresponding range of the diffusion parameter is a factor of 3\nor less. The relative effect of a change of diffusion parameter\nincreases sharply at the lower values.\nIn the morning sector it is noteworthy that there is a ten-\ndency for the low ratios to occur at the smaller values of A2\nwithin an individual pass, not necessarily at the lowest val-\nues for the sector overall. For example, the low ratios occur\nwhen A2 is from 0.5 to 0.7 in passes 95-222 and 94-282, but\nbetween 2 and 3 in passes 95-282 and 95-125. This suggests\nthat the behaviour is also being influenced by some factor\nother than the flux level, and one which changes from time\nto time.\n5.2 The noon sector\nFigure 10 shows the relationship between the count rates for\nthe trapped (CT) and precipitated (CP) components during\nthe two overpasses (95-058 and 95-086) recorded in the noon\nsector; both the 100 keV and the 30 keV data are plotted. The\ndata cover 4 orders of magnitude in CP. The correlation co-\nefficient (between the logarithms) is \u03c1=0.963, and the regres-\nsion equation for CP against CT is\nCP= 4.02\u00d710\u22125C1.999T (4)\nwith standard error a factor of 1.94. The probability of this\nvalue of \u03c1 occurring by chance in a data set of 72 points is\nabout 10\u221257!\nTwo points are noteworthy here. First, the same relation-\nship applies to both energy ranges, so presumably it is not\nenergy dependent. Second, the two passes whose data fit so\nwell to the same law were recorded a month apart (February\nand March of 1995). This does not guarantee that the same\nrelationship would hold for all such observations, but it does\nsuggest a certain stability in the mechanism.\nA similar relationship was found in a previous investiga-\ntion (Birch et al., 2009) which used hourly values derived\nfrom all overpasses in the LT sector 11.5\u201312.5 over invariant\nlatitudes 65\u201370\u25e6 during a period of 6 h on one day having\nenhanced solar wind. In this case the raw data were averages\nover 16 s (implying spatial averaging over 120 km). The rela-\ntionship was of the form of Eq. (4) but the constant of propor-\ntionality was 4.06\u00d710\u22126 instead of 4.02\u00d710\u22125. These ob-\nservations were in the month of July. The suggestion, there-\nfore, is that in the noon sector the precipitated\/trapped ratio\nis essentially proportional to the trapped flux, but the propor-\ntionality may change, possibly with the time of year. No such\nrelationship was found in the data from the night or morning\nsectors.\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/28\/1107\/2010\/ Ann. Geophys., 28, 1107\u20131120, 2010\n1116 J. K.

We have\nused only the ratio F(100)\/F(30), since the count rates above\n300 keV may be very small and therefore subject to any low-\nlevel background (e.g. cosmic rays) that may be present.\nFigure 11 plots the 2-s data as SM (=FM(100)\/FM(30))\nagainst (absorption)2 for each of the 10 Kilpisja\u00a8rvi over-\npasses. Distinct symbols are used for the individual passes,\nand they are collated into the night (a), morning (b) and noon\n(c) sectors. FM (=\n\u221a\nFT\u00d7FP) is taken to indicate the flux\nreaching the 90 km level; we have seen that A2 is well cor-\nrelated with the magnitude of FM, being essentially propor-\ntional to it.

There are also differences in spectral hardness between\nindividual passes in the same local time sector, most no-\ntably in the night sector where there are variations both\nwithin and between individual passes. There is no sig-\nnificant correlation of spectral hardness with A2 in this\nsector.\n3. In the morning sector there is some variation of spectral\nhardness with A2 overall, though its significance may\nbe doubted in view of the amount of variation within\nindividual passes, these showing no correlation withA2.\n4. The noon sector, though represented by only two passes,\nshows what appears to be a significant variation of spec-\ntral hardness with A2. Figure 11c is based on the geo-\nmetric mean of the values for the trapped and the pre-\ncipitated components in the noon sector, but detailed\nexamination reveals that both components show a ten-\ndency for the hardness to increase with the trapped flux\n(FT(30)), the variation being considerably greater for\nthe precipitated component. According to the theory\nof pitch-angle scattering by wave-particle interaction,\none condition is that the parallel energy of the particle\nmust exceed a threshold value (W\u2016=B2\/2\u00b50N , where B\nis the magnetic flux density, and N the density of cold\nplasma). This effect would alter the spectral hardness,\nan increase of W\u2016 reducing the 30 keV flux but not the\n100 keV flux. However, in this situation an increase of\nflux would be associated with decreased hardness, the\nopposite of what is observed.\n6.2 Relative spectral hardness of precipitated and\ntrapped components\nA previous study (Birch et al., 2009) reported that during\nan active period (associated with high-speed solar wind) the\nprecipitated flux in the morning and noon sectors tends to be\nsofter than the trapped. This is at a time when the trapped\nflux is enhanced and we expect the resulting radio absorp-\ntion to be significant. (During times of slower solar wind\nthe trapped flux was considerably weaker but the precipi-\ntated component was then harder than the trapped.) Since\nthe spectral hardness ratio\nSP\nST\n= FP(100)\nFP(30)\n\u00d7 FT(30)\nFT(100)\n= R(100)\nR(30)\n, (6)\n(where R=FP\/FT), that quantity also compares the\nprecipitated-to-trapped ratios at >100 keV and >30 keV.\nFigure 12 plots this ratio against A2 for each of the local\ntime sectors. If these data can be taken as representative, they\nimply striking differences of behaviour between the sectors.\nTaking the whole group together, the morning sector shows\na tendency for R100\/R30 to increase with A2, though such\ntrends are not convincingly visible for individual overpasses.\nThe noon group shows an increase of R(100)\/R(30) consis-\ntent with the comments of item 4 in the previous section. The\nTable 7.

The points from each pass tend to clump together,\nbut without systematic variation with A2, either within or be-\ntween the clumps.\n7 Conclusions and discussion\n7.1 Main conclusions\n1. The correlation between the detailed structure of an\nauroral absorption event and the fluxes of >30 keV\nelectrons detected by an overflying satellite are close\nenough for one quantity to be predicted from the other\nwith good accuracy: the flux from the absorption with\nstandard error better than a factor of 2, or the absorption\nfrom the flux with standard error a factor of about 1.3.\n2. The best agreement is obtained by taking the geometric\nmean of the trapped and precipitated flux to represent\nthe energetic electron flux reaching 90 km. The relation-\nship between flux and absorption depends somewhat on\nthe local time, no doubt due to variations of spectrum.\n3. The details of the spatial structure do not change signif-\nicantly throughout the duration of a satellite overpass,\nimplying that the fine structure in the particle flux is es-\nsentially spatial rather than temporal.\n4. The amount of variation represented by the fine struc-\nture also depends on the local time, being least at noon\nand greatest in the morning sector. In every case the pre-\ncipitated flux varies more than the trapped component.\nThis is consistent with the concept of trapped electrons\nbeing scattered into the loss cone, but with a depen-\ndence on conditions in the region of the magnetosphere\ninvolved in the scattering process.\n5. In the noon sector the precipitated and the trapped fluxes\nare highly correlated, having a square law relationship\n(FP\u221dF 2T ). This close relationship was not found in the\nmorning or the night sectors.\n7.2 Discussion\nWe have noted significant differences of behaviour between\nthe three local times covered by our data. Presumably\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/28\/1107\/2010\/ Ann. Geophys., 28, 1107\u20131120, 2010\n1120 J. K. Hargreaves et al.: Fine structure of medium energy electron fluxes in the auroral zone\nthese must be caused by differences in the characteristics\nof the regions of the magnetosphere involved in the relevant\nphysical processes. Table 7 gives typical locations for the\napexes of field lines originating from Kilpisja\u00a8rvi at the local\ntimes of our \u201cnight\u201d, \u201cmorning\u201d and \u201cnoon\u201d groups. These\nwere computed using the GSFC program available from\nhttp:\/\/modelweb.gsfc.nasa.goc\/models\/cgm\/t96.html, which\nis based on the T-96 magnetosphere model (Tsyganenko,\n1995).\nThe night group shows an influence of the magnetotail, the\nfield lines being pulled further from the Earth and somewhat\ntailward. With the Earth\u2019s rotation the apex is moving closer\nto the Earth and the lines are shortening. The circulation of\nthe magnetosphere presumably exaggerates this effect.\nThe morning group, where the variability is greatest, has\nno great extension of the field-lines and the acceleration of\nthe trapped electrons appears to be complete at this time,\nsince the noon group is no more energetic. The morning\ngroup is within the period of greatest precipitation activ-\nity for electrons with energies of \u201ctens of keV\u201d as indi-\ncated by the statistics of auroral absorption and VLF noise\n(Pope, 1963; Bullough et al., 1969; Hargreaves and Bul-\nlough, 1972). Having regard to earlier work, it is suggested\nthat the VLF waves responsible for pitch-angle scattering at\nthis local time were generated at a lower latitude, making this\nan instance of Thorne\u2019s \u201cparasitic\u201d process. The existence of\na subgroup with particularly low precipitated\/trapped ratio\n(Fig. 9b) could suggest that these field lines are at times be-\ning shielded from the scattering radiation.\nThe noon group, a mere 4 h later, has surprisingly differ-\nent characteristics. Though the energy is unchanged from the\nmorning period, the variability of precipitation is much less\nand there is a remarkable and clear dependence of the precip-\nitation on the level of trapped flux, strongly suggesting that\npitch-angle scattering by Thorne\u2019s \u201cunstable\u201d process is in\ncontrol.\nIn discussing some of the rocket data on energetic elec-\ntrons, McDiarmid and Budzinski (1964) remarked that \u201cthe\nphenomena are complicated and extremely variable\u201d. That\nview still holds.\nAcknowledgements. We acknowledge the work of W. G. Howarth\nin the initial stages of this study several years ago, and the partici-\npation of B. J. I.
