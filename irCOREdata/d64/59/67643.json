Electromagnetic low-frequency waves in the mag-\nnetotail lobe close to the PSBL (Plasma Sheet Boundary\nLayer) are studied using the Cluster spacecraft. The lobe\nwaves show Alfve\u00b4nic properties and transport their wave en-\nergy (Poynting flux) on average toward the Earth along mag-\nnetic field lines. Most of the wave events are rich with oxy-\ngen (O+) ion plasma. The rich O+ plasma can serve to en-\nhance the magnetic field fluctuations, resulting in a greater\nlikelihood of observation, but it does not appear to be nec-\nessary for the generation of the waves. Taking into account\nthe fact that all events are associated with auroral electro-\njet enhancements, the source of the lobe waves might be a\nsubstorm-associated instability, i.e. some instability near the\nreconnection site, or an ion beam-related instability in the\nPSBL.\nKeywords. Magnetospheric physics (Magnetotail; MHD\nwaves and instabilities; Storms and substorms)\n1 Introduction\nThe magnetotail lobe is an empty region, where the mag-\nnetic field is stronger and the plasma density is lower than in\nthe neighboring magnetosheath and plasma sheet (e.g. Stern,\n1979). Only a few studies have reported ULF waves in the\nlobe, i.e. Pc4-Pc5 waves (45-s to 10-min periods) (e.g. Chen\nand Kivelson, 1991). The plausible sources of lobe waves are\neither an outer source, such as the global Kelvin-Helmholtz\nInstability (KHI) at the magnetopause (Smith et al., 1990;\nSarafopoulos and Sarris, 1994), or an inner source, such as\nCorrespondence to: T. Takada\n(taku.takada@oeaw.ac.at)\ncompressional waves in the plasma sheet. As for an outer\nsource, Sarafopoulos (1995) reported a good correlation be-\ntween ULF waves and the solar wind dynamic pressure in an\nevent study. As a case for an inner source, Elphinstone et\nal. (1995) presented IMP 8 observations of fast mode waves\nin the lobe, which appeared to be propagating earthward\nfrom a source located tailward of X\u223c\u221228RE . Keiling et\nal. (2005) recently reported Polar observations of substorm-\nassociated lobe Alfve\u00b4n waves at geocentric distances of 5\u2013\n6RE . Some theories about Alfve\u00b4n resonance coupling in the\nPSBL assume waves propagating through the lobe, suppos-\nedly generated by an outer source (Smith et al., 1986; Har-\nrold et al., 1990; De Keyser, 2000) or an inner source (Liu\net al., 1995; Allan and Wright, 1998, 2000). More abun-\ndant and enhanced waves are observed in the PSBL (e.g.\nTsurutani et al., 1985; Akimoto et al., 1987; Angelopou-\nlos et al., 1989). Takada et al. (2005) statistically examined\nthe low-frequency waves in the tail PSBL between X=(\u221215,\n\u221231)RE and suggested that the waves are Alfve\u00b4nic and are\npossibly generated locally by ion-beam related instabilities.\nThose PSBL waves are also considered to be the source of\nlarge-amplitude Alfve\u00b4n waves observed by Polar in the near-\nEarth PSBL at geocentric distances of 4\u20136RE (e.g. Wygant\net al., 2000). Due to the existence of higher frequency elec-\ntric field fluctuations, the electric-to-magnetic field fluctua-\ntions fit to the dispersion relation of kinetic Alfve\u00b4n waves\n(KAW) in the Polar orbit (Wygant et al., 2002) and also at\nGeotail distances ofX\u223c\u221218RE (Angelopoulos et al., 2002).\nThe magnetotail lobe maps to the high latitude polar cap\nregions on the Earth. Ground observations sometimes show\nULF pulsations in the regions of open field lines. Weather-\nwax et al. (1997) reported a relation between Pc5 pulsations\nand cosmic radio noise absorption, i.e. precipitating energetic\nPublished by Copernicus GmbH on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n1002 T.

Most of the pulsations are closely related to the\ncusp (Ballatore et al., 1998) or the auroral electrojet (Pil-\nlipenko et al., 2001). Yagova et al. (2004) recently reported\nthat some Pc5 pulsations at high latitude stations were inde-\npendent of the cusp and auroral activities. Therefore, no con-\nclusive generation mechanism of those pulsations yet exists.\nAnn. Geophys., 24, 1001\u20131013, 2006 www.ann-geophys.net\/24\/1001\/2006\/\nT. Takada et al.: Alfve\u00b4n waves in the near-PSBL lobe: Cluster observations 1003\nThus, there are possibly two source regions considered\nfor lobe waves. Of particular interest is whether substorm-\nassociated (Keiling et al., 2005) Alfve\u00b4n waves in near-Earth\ncan also be identified in a more distant region, which is closer\nto the reconnection sites. In this study the magnetic\/electric\nfield fluctuations in the near-PSBL lobe at X=(\u22126, \u221220)RE\nare analyzed in detail. The Cluster orbit during the summer\nseason leads to lobe\/PSBL crossings close to the observed re-\nconnection sites. In Sect. 2, a lobe wave event on 11 Septem-\nber 2002 is investigated in detail and the statistical properties\nof lobe waves are shown by examining 10 selected events.\nThen we discuss the characteristics of lobe waves and their\nrelation with waves in other regions, for example, PSBL and\nground polar cap.\nWe mainly use the data obtained by the FluxGate Magne-\ntometer (FGM) instrument (Balogh et al., 2001) of the Clus-\nter Spacecraft (SC) 1\u20134, the Electron Drift Instrument (EDI,\nPaschmann et al., 2001) of SC 1 and 3, and the COmposition\nand DIstribution Function analyser (CODIF) of the Cluster\nIon Spectrometry experiment (CIS) (Re`me et al., 2001) of\nSC 1, 3 and 4. All data throughout the paper are shown in\nthe Aberrated Geomagnetic Solar Magnetospheric (AGSM)\nsystem, which is aligned with the solar wind flow (\u223c4\u25e6).\n2 Observation\nWe have studied the wave characteristics of 10 events of lobe\nmagnetic field fluctuation. The events are selected during\nJuly to October 2001 and 2002, when the apogee of Clus-\nter was in the nightside magnetotail. The criteria for the\nevent selection are the following: X<\u22126RE , |Y|<10RE ,\nand electric field data from the EDI instrument should be\navailable on at least one spacecraft. The density criteria for\nthe lobe, NP<0.03 cm\u22123 (see, e.g. the red line in Fig. 1c), is\nset to exclude boundary and mantle plasma. Our data set does\nnot include dense lobe plasma (e.g. Sauvaud et al., 2004).\nThe magnetic field fluctuations (B0\u223c5-min moving average)\nshould have a peak-to-peak amplitude of more than 1 nT and\nlast at least 5 min within 30 min before\/after a lobe\/PSBL\ncrossing. The 5-min time window is chosen to remove any\nweak structure-associated trend, but to keep distinct wave-\nlike fluctuations with periods of more than 5 min. Note that\nwe do not use any O+ information for selection.\n2.1 Lobe wave characteristics: 11 September 2002 event\nOne lobe fluctuation event is analyzed in detail in this sub-\nsection. As shown in Fig. 1, Cluster is located first in the\nlobe at (X, Y,Z)=(\u201318.0,4.1, \u20135.0)RE , crosses the plasma\nsheet (PS)-lobe boundary at 21:40 UT and then enters into\nthe plasma sheet at \u223c21:43 UT. In the lobe (gray shaded\narea) O+ beams from the ionosphere are clearly observed\n(Seki et al., 1998, and references therein). The magnetic\nfield is almost stable in the lobe and strongly fluctuates in the\nPSBL\/PS. However, wavelet spectra of both magnetic and\nperpendicular electric fluctuations in the lobe clearly show\na right-hand mode enhancement at periods of \u223c2\u20135 min.\nRight-hand mode fluctuations appeared from \u223c21:27 UT\nwith gradually increasing periods (decreasing frequencies).\nA weak left-hand mode actually appears around 21:25 UT\nand another left-hand mode appears again after 21:36 UT. Al-\nthough the polarization depends on each interval, the trans-\nverse components are generally dominant in the lobe, as in\nPSBL waves (Bauer et al., 1995). Another interesting point\nis that the spectra of electric field fluctuations seem to be\noverlapped with short period (high frequency) components.\nAfter the PS-lobe boundary crossing, magnetic fluctuations,\nsuch as magnetic noise bursts, are enhanced and broadened\ninto the wide frequency ranges in the PSBL\/PS (e.g. Cattell\net al., 1986). In the PSBL\/PS the electric field data of EDI,\nwhich measures the drift velocity of artificially injected elec-\ntron beams, are often not available due to beam scattering.\nThe wave packets of magnetic and perpendicular electric\nfield fluctuations observed by SC3 are shown in Fig. 2. The\nmagnetic fluctuations are subtracted from the background\nmagnetic field which is calculated as a moving average of\n10 min. As shown in Figs. 1g\u2013k, the field fluctuations start\nfrom \u223c21:25 UT, with those perpendicular to B0 (almost\ncorresponding to the Y and Z components) fluctuating more\nthan the field-aligned fluctuations. The Poynting flux is cal-\nculated from the fluctuations of magnetic and perpendicular\nelectric fields (S=dE\u22a5\u00d7dB) and is linearly-interpolated dur-\ning the intervals when electric field data are missing. The\nmost dominant component of the Poynting flux is the X\ncomponent, directed earthward on average. The flux is of\nthe order of 10\u22124 mW\/m2 and <1 mW\/m2 when mapped at\nan altitude of 100 km (assuming B=50 000 nT). Using mag-\nnetic field fluctuations at one spacecraft the Minimum Vari-\nance Analysis (MVA) is performed within a window of 5 min\n(Sonnerup and Cahill, 1967). The MV axis is considered to\nbe the propagation vector if the wave is completely a trans-\nverse wave. The angle between the MV axis and the back-\nground field is defined as \u03b8MVA. Between 21:30 UT and\n21:35 UT, when the eigenvalue ratio (\u03bbmin\/\u03bbint) is relatively\nsmall, thus indicating a good MVA determination, \u03b8MVA is\ncomparable to or less than 30 deg. The Poynting flux ob-\nserved by SC1 (not shown) is consistent with the SC 3 obser-\nvations, although electric field data of SC 1 often has large\ndata gaps. The MVA of the other spacecraft also shows that\nthe \u03b8MVA angle is less than 30 deg (not shown).\nFigures 3a\u2013b show the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) spec-\ntra of magnetic and electric field fluctuations during 21:25\u2013\n21:40 UT.

To show the effect\nthat the O+ admixture has on Alfve\u00b4n velocity, the Alfve\u00b4n ve-\nlocity is also calculated only from NP and |B|.\n2.2 Statistical properties\nThe wave characteristics of 10 events of the lobe magnetic\nfield fluctuation are studied. In each event, the 10-min in-\ntervals, including most enhanced fluctuations, are selected in\norder to compare with the same FFT window.\nTwo examples of lobe Alfve\u00b4n wave events are shown in\nFig. 4. The proton energy-time diagrams clearly show PS-\nlobe boundary crossings at 14:54 UT on 14 August 2001 and\n12:40\/12:43 UT on 10 October 2001 events, respectively. In\nthe lobe, O+ beams are observed in these two cases, and a\nsimilar O+ signature is also detected in all 10 events (not\nshown). Magnetic and perpendicular electric field fluctua-\ntions are observed in the lobe before the PS-lobe boundary\ncrossing. In the 14 August 2001 event, the electromagnetic\nfluctuations gradually increase until the PS-lobe boundary\ncrossing. Before the PS-lobe boundary crossing in the 10 Oc-\ntober 2001 event, intensification of the magnetic and electric\nfield fluctuations is detected from\u223c12:30 UT. These are typ-\nical features of the observed lobe wave events.\nIn order to investigate the propagation direction of these\nwaves, we next conduct the MVA. MV axes of all events in\ntheX\u2212Y andX\u2212Z planes are shown in Figs. 5a\u2013b. The vec-\ntor of the MV axis is calculated for every 4 s within a 5-min\nsliding window by determining its polarity so as to have a\npositive X component, and then averaged over each compo-\nnent during the 10-min interval of the event. If the MV axis\nchanges dramatically during the interval, the vector of the\nAnn. Geophys., 24, 1001\u20131013, 2006 www.ann-geophys.net\/24\/1001\/2006\/\nT.

The MV axis is almost along\nthe background magnetic field, B0. This is consistent with\ntransverse waves propagating along magnetic field lines. Av-\nerage Poynting fluxes of all events inX\u2212Y andX\u2212Z planes\nare also shown in Figs. 5c and 5d. The direction of the Poynt-\ning flux is almost field-aligned and earthward in both hemi-\nspheres, assuming that the parallel electric field is negligi-\nble, i.e. E\u00b7B=0. The results suggest that the wave energy in\nthe near-tail X=(\u22126, \u221220)RE is transported mainly inward\nfrom the more distant tail. The absolute value of the Poynt-\ning flux ranges between about 2.9\u00d710\u22125\u20136.7\u00d710\u22124 mW\/m2\n(peak: \u20137.1\u00d710\u22123 to 2.6\u00d710\u22122 mW\/m2), and amounts to\n4.6\u00d710\u22122\u20135.7\u00d710\u22121 mW\/m2 (peak: \u223c10 mW\/m2) when\nmapped at an altitude of 100 km, as shown before. This is\nroughly two orders of magnitude smaller than that of large\namplitude Alfve\u00b4n waves in the PSBL (Takada et al., 2005,\nand references therein). The difference of the Poynting flux\nbetween PSBL and lobe waves is consistent with this (2\u20133\norders difference) at Polar altitude (Keiling et al., 2005). In\norder to check the Alfve\u00b4nic property, the FFT power ratio,\n|1E\u22a5|\/|1B\u22a5|, at the frequency peak is plotted in Fig. 5e\nagainst the local Alfve\u00b4n velocity, VA, calculated from NP ,\nNO+ , and |B|. As with the PSBL waves (Wygant et al.,\n2000; Angelopoulos et al., 2002), the |1E\u22a5|\/|1B\u22a5| is much\nlarger than that expected for steady-state closure through typ-\nical ionospheric conductivities, i.e. 1E\/1B=1\/\u00b506P , where\nthe 6P is the height-integrated Pedersen conductivity, which\nshould be 5\u201310 S in a region of active auroral electron pre-\ncipitation. Since most points are far away from 1\/\u00b506P yet\nwithin \u00b150% of VA, the wave looks like an Alfve\u00b4n wave.\nThe Alfve\u00b4n velocity is not so high in these events (\u223c1000\u2013\n3000 km\/s) because of the O+ density as shown in Fig. 5f,\nand the O+ density is often much higher than the proton den-\nsity.\nAll the selected lobe wave events occurred during the ex-\nistence of an O+ beam with NO+\u2265NP . It brings up the ques-\ntion of whether a necessary condition for lobe wave genera-\ntion is the rich O+ plasma. To clarify the role of O+ beams,\nwe searched again for lobe wave events without O+ beams,\nneglecting the criterion of EDI electric field data availabil-\nity. Only one example was found during summer 2001 and\n2002, which is shown in Fig. 6. Magnetic field fluctuations\nare present in the lobe during an enhanced proton density in-\nterval at 15:00\u201315:20 UT and weak fluctuations are also seen\nat 15:35\u201315:45 UT. The PSBL\/lobe crossings in this event\nare around 15:25\u201315:35 UT with broad-band electrostatic\nemissions (e.g. Kojima et al., 1997) and around 15:45 UT\n(before the PSBL ion beam detection) with an enhancement\nof the curlometer (Chanteur, 1998) current (not shown). In\nthis case we cannot confirm whether the ratio |1E\u22a5|\/|1B\u22a5|\ncorresponds to the Alfve\u00b4n velocity, because no electric field\ndata are available. However, wave characteristics, such as\nthe predominance of the transverse components, and similar\namplitudes and frequencies, suggest a similarity of the wave\nf [Hz]\n\u0394E\/\u0394B\n[km\/s]\n\u0394B\n[nT \/Hz]\n\u0394E\n[mV \/m Hz]\n\u0394E\/\u0394B\n[km\/s]\n2 2\n2\n(a)\n(d)\n(c)\n(b)\nVA (P,O+)\nVA (P,O+)\nVA (P)\nf O+\ndB~7.8X10\n-3\nFig. 3.

Figures 7a\u2013i show the three\nparameters during the ten lobe wave events. As for the mag-\nnetic storm condition, 8 events occur during the recovery\nphase and one event (13 August 2001) is in the main phase.\nOn 14 August 2001, a small storm has already recovered be-\nfore the event. However, in all events, storm-associated O+\ntransport into the magnetosphere is possible (e.g. Daglis and\nAxford, 1996; Nose\u00b4 et al., 2001). BH \/BX at high latitude\nstations are shown in the second panel of Figs. 7a\u2013i (e.g. Yu-\nmoto et al., 2001). In all events the waves appear (dashed\nvertical lines) during an enhancement of the auroral elec-\ntrojet, i.e. during the expansion or recovery phases of sub-\nstorms. The green dashed lines also mark the start time of\nmagnetic field fluctuations, which are far from the PS-lobe\nboundary crossing and are not selected for our 10 events.\nThe PS-lobe boundary crossing (solid lines) is considered\nto be related to the expansion\/thinning of the plasma sheet\n(e.g. Baumjohann et al., 1992) and is also seen during the\nrecovery phase. Solar wind speed during these events is dis-\ntributed between 400\u2013700 km\/s and is not large (<500 km\/s)\nin 7 events out of 10. Pc3-5 ULF pulsations observed on the\nground and in the magnetosphere are strongly enhanced un-\nder the fast solar wind of >500 km\/s and are explained to be\ngenerated by KHI (Junginger and Baumjohann, 1988; Enge-\nbretson et al., 1998, and references therein). These results\nsuggest that the lobe waves are mainly substorm-associated,\nrather than KHI-associated, since the wave appearance cor-\nresponds to auroral electrojet enhancements and is not biased\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/24\/1001\/2006\/ Ann.

Although it may be possi-\nble to be KHI-associated waves during fast solar wind con-\ndition, we cannot confirm the possibility in this study. The\ndense proton event shown in Fig. 7j, took place during a non-\nstorm period, as expected from the absence of O+. Similar\nto the other events, it occurred during an enhanced auroral\nelectrojet, however, there was also a high solar wind velocity\n(>600 km\/s). Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility of\nKHI, that is, of an outer source for this event and three events\nof 10 (Figs. 7c, d and h).\n3 Discussion\nThe relation, |1E\u22a5|\/|1B\u22a5| \u223cVA\u221dB\/\u221aNP+16NO+, is sta-\ntistically satisfied for the observed waves, as shown in\nFig. 5e. Combining with S\u2016=1E\u22a5\u00b71B\u22a5, the magnetic\nfield fluctuations are written as 1B2\u22a5\u221d\n\u221a\nNP+16NO+S\u2016\/B.\nSince the lobe waves of our events are observed only during\na \u201cdense plasma\u201d period,\n\u221a\nNP+16NO+ has a lower limit.\nOn the other hand, the magnetic field fluctuations of the ob-\nserved lobe waves were in general weak and did not exceed\na peak-to-peak amplitude of \u223c4 nT. Thus, we obtain a limi-\ntation of S\u2016<max(1B2\u22a5)\/min(\n\u221a\nNP+16NO+), which means\nthe Poynting flux of the observed lobe waves were limited in-\ndependent of the plasma condition. Note that due to our lobe\ncriterion, NP<0.03 cm\u22123, some dense proton lobe events\nwithout O+ beams may have been eliminated. Therefore,\nin the case that the O+ ion is absent and the proton density is\nsame, the Alfve\u00b4n velocity increases and 1B\u22a5 drops down to\na criteria value in this study (in general, noise level), due to a\nlimited Poynting flux. This could be one of the reasons why\nthe lobe waves were accompanied by O+ beams.\nParticle instruments have limitations for density measure-\nment because of the limited energy range and 1-count level\nof detectors. The Whisper instrument (Whisper of High fre-\nquency and Sounder for Probing Electron density by Relax-\nation) (De\u00b4cre\u00b4au et al., 2001) on board Cluster provides the\nspectrum of natural plasma emissions in the frequency band\nfrom 2\u201380 kHz and the electron densities determined via the\nrelaxation sounder (4\u201383 kHz) (Trotignon et al., 2001). Since\nthe plasma frequency in the lobe is larger than the cyclotron\nfrequency, the upper-hybrid frequency is close to the electron\nplasma frequency, which should be in the range of frequen-\ncies covered. Unfortunately, the total ion density in our cases\nis around 0.01\u20130.2 cm\u22123 (\u03c9pe\u223c0.9\u20134 kHz), even during the\nAnn.

In or-\nder to assess the possibility of density underestimation by a\nparticle detector, however, we can check if a lower cutoff at\nthe electron plasma frequency is absent in the range of the\ninstrument, suggesting the existence of a cutoff below the\nlimit. In one case (24 September 2001), the total ion density\nis in the corresponding frequency range of the Whisper in-\nstrument, and the total density observed by CIS almost equals\nthe estimated electron density by the relaxation sounder. In\nthe other 9 cases, the spectra at least deny the possibility of\nhigher electron density. Therefore, we think that the density\nestimation capability of particle instruments is enough to cal-\nculate the Alfve\u00b4n velocity.\nIn general, there are two external wave sources, such\nas the magnetopause\/magnetosheath (outer source) and the\nPSBL\/PS (inner source). The close association with sub-\nstorms shown in all the cases suggests an inner source, al-\nthough the selected intervals within 30 min of PSBL\/lobe\ncrossings are preferable for the wave related to the inner\nsource. This is consistent with the results of Keiling et\nal. (2005), where the lobe Alfve\u00b4n waves started to be ob-\nserved at substorm onset. In the PSBL, the low-frequency\nwaves are often detected as KAW by Geotail (Angelopoulos\net al., 2002) and by Polar (Wygant et al., 2002). The leak-\nage of PSBL waves to the lobe is plausible to explain the\nlobe wave features consistent with the KAW-like feature dis-\ncussed later. In the magnetotail waveguide model (Wright et\nal., 1999; Allan and Wright, 2000), however, the perpendic-\nular wave number of the mode-converted Alfve\u00b4n wave de-\ncreases sharply from the PSBL to the lobe (kz\u223c0). After the\nwave appearance, ion beams are observed in all events dur-\ning the PSBL crossing, which shows the possibility that the\nion beams already exist in the PSBL. Thus, the wave gen-\neration might be associated with magnetic reconnection or\nan ion beam instability in the PSBL. The event on 10 Oc-\ntober 2001, shown in Fig. 4, is a good example to judge\nthis view. The event was studied in detail by Nakamura et\nal. (2004). At the time of the lobe wave appearance, Geo-\ntail started to observe PSBL ion beams in the opposite hemi-\nsphere (see their Fig. 4). This suggests that PSBL ion beams\nare active during the near-PSBL lobe wave. There are two\ncandidates for the lobe waves: waves generated by the recon-\nnection process and\/or the release of a plasmoid (e.g. Siscoe,\n1969; Hones et al., 1987; Allan and Wright, 2000) or leak-\nage of KAW from the PSBL. Allan and Wright (1998, 2000)\ntheoretically suggest that the large Alfve\u00b4n velocity gradient\nin the tail configuration converts fast mode (compressional)\nwaves through the boundary into Alfve\u00b4n waves with a phase-\nmixing process. The warm plasma in the PSBL would en-\nsure that the waves would have some kinetic characteristics,\nwhereas shear Alfve\u00b4n waves would be proceeded in the lobe.\nHowever, specifying the generation mechanism of the lobe\nAlfve\u00b4n wave is beyond the scope of this paper.\nIn low \u03b2 (\u223c0.001) conditions, the obliquely propagating\nAlfve\u00b4n wave works as a KAW (Lysak and Lotko, 1996).\nIn Fig. 3d, the dispersion relation is depicted as a solid\ncurve (e.g. Stasiewicz et al., 2001). In order to calculate the\ndispersion relation, we use the average VA, Te\u223c1\/7<Tp>\n(Baumjohann et al., 1989), and Vs=38 km\/s (plasma struc-\nture velocity with respect to the spacecraft). The largest\nvelocity along the wave propagation direction is selected\nas Vs among the following: plasma sheet moving velocity,\nVPSBL \u223c100 km\/s (parallel component, VPSBL\u2016< 30 km\/s),\naverage O+ beam velocity (\u223c38 km\/s) and spacecraft veloc-\nity (less than 2 km\/s). The plasma sheet moving velocity is\ncalculated at the PS-lobe boundary crossing at 21:40 UT, us-\ning four spacecraft timing analysis (abrupt |B| decrease). The\ncurve of 1E\/1B against the frequency looks very similar to\nthe observational curve in Fig. 3c. However, we cannot con-\nfirm this property because the power of magnetic fluctuations\nin the higher frequency range approach the digital resolution\nof the instrument (dB=7.8\u00d710\u22123 nT, see Balogh et al., 2001).\nIt should be noted that the intermittent high-frequency fluc-\ntuations of the electric field might be manifestations of the\nKAW.\nMost of the lobe wave events are related to rich O+ con-\nditions. The O+ ions are transported from the ionosphere to\nthe magnetotail lobe (e.g. Chappell et al., 1987; Lennarts-\nson, 1994; Seki et al., 1998). In the lobe region, the en-\nergy of O+ beam in our events is between 100 eV and 1 keV\nand occasionally more energized. An energization process\ncan occur very close to the PSBL (Hirahara et al., 1994) and\nmay be related to the KAW or an ion beam instability in the\nPSBL. Another energization process (mainly perpendicular\nacceleration) is related to lobe fluctuations. This is because\nthe perpendicular velocity increases so as to correspond to\nthe perpendicular electric field fluctuations (Sauvaud et al.,\n2004; Sergeev et al., 2005). A parallel acceleration due to the\nponderomotive force of lobe waves is theoretically suggested\n(Allan, 1993; Allan and Wright, 2000). The in-situ Poynting\nflux of lobe waves is quite lower than that in the PSBL, but\nthe cross-sectional area of the lobe is much larger than that of\nthe PSBL. If the non-visible fluctuations, i.e. which are ob-\nservationally too small fluctuations fill the whole lobe in the\ncase of 100% proton plasma, this acceleration mechanism\nmight not be negligible in addition to the cusp\/cleft acceler-\nation (e.g. Bouhram et al., 2002; Bogdanova et al., 2005).\nHowever, quantitative evaluation of the acceleration by pon-\nderomotive force is for future work due to the lack of wave\nobservations in the whole lobe.\nAs suggested in our study, lobe waves propagate earth-\nward. It may finally reach the ionosphere, i.e. the polar cap\nregion. Yagova et al. (2002, 2004) recently reported that ULF\nwaves in the polar cap behave independently from wave ac-\ntivity in the cusp or auroral regions. The coherence of waves\nis high throughout the polar cap, while the correlation be-\ntween auroral and polar cap is found to be poor. They discuss\nas one of the possibilities that the source of such waves is the\ntail lobe, although lobe waves in this study are originally as-\nsociated with the substorms. However, the ULF waves in the\nAnn. Geophys., 24, 1001\u20131013, 2006 www.ann-geophys.net\/24\/1001\/2006\/\nT. Takada et al.: Alfve\u00b4n waves in the near-PSBL lobe: Cluster observations 1011\npolar cap, different from the auroral region waves, may be\nthe result of the different propagation speeds of waves (VA)\nbetween the lobe and the PSBL. In addition, the PSBL waves\nare also absorbed or weakened via auroral electron acceler-\nation (e.g. Keiling et al., 2003). The wave property\/timing\nbetween auroral electrojet and polar cap should be different\non the ground.\n4 Summary\nLow-frequency electromagnetic waves in the lobe are inves-\ntigated using Cluster magnetic field, electric field, and parti-\ncle data. The electromagnetic fluctuations close to the PSBL\nshow an Alfve\u00b4nic characteristic, i.e. 1E\/1B is close to the\nAlfve\u00b4n velocity. The waves propagate almost along field\nlines waves in the tail PSBL betweenand on average carry\ntheir Poynting flux (2.9\u00d710\u22125\u20136.7\u00d710\u22124 mW\/m2 in situ) to-\nward the Earth. The Poynting flux is roughly two orders of\nmagnitude smaller than the typical value in the PSBL. Most\nof lobe waves are associated with O+ beams, which decrease\nthe local Alfve\u00b4n velocity, increase 1B, and thus make the\nwaves detectable with the instrument used, rather than gen-\nerate them locally. As all wave events are observed under the\nauroral electrojet enhancements when the PSBL ion beam\nejection is active, but not necessarily during high speed solar\nwind, the generation mechanism of these waves is considered\nto be associated with an inner source, such as some instabili-\nties near a reconnection site or the leakage of kinetic Alfve\u00b4n\nwaves in PSBL.\nAcknowledgements.
