In the Arctic, the prevailing meteorology differs from\nCorrespondence to: A. E. Jones\n(aejo@bas.ac.uk)\nthat in Antarctica, but, while a less common effect, major low\npressure systems in the Arctic can also generate BrO clouds.\nSuch depressions thus appear to be fundamental when con-\nsidering the broader influence of ODEs, certainly in Antarc-\ntica, such as halogen export and the radiative influence of\nozone-depleted air masses.\n1 Introduction\nThe remarkable behaviour exhibited by tropospheric ozone\nduring spring in both polar regions is well documented (see\nSimpson et al., 2007 for full overview). Concentrations of\nozone can fall from background levels to below instrumenta-\ntion detection limits and remain suppressed for timescales\nof the order of hours to days. These excursions are ob-\nserved sporadically from coastal locations, and are widely re-\nferred to as tropospheric ozone depletion events (ODEs). The\nozone depletion is driven by halogen chemistry, most notably\nbromine, which has a source associated with the sea ice zone\n(e.g. Neuman et al., 2010). The exact source(s) and mecha-\nnisms responsible for bromine-release are still subject to de-\nbate, but the combination of concentrated sea salt in a con-\ndensed phase substrate appears to be a pre-requisite. Under\nthese conditions, and with sufficient acidity, gaseous HOBr\ncan react with sea salt bromide within the condensed phase\nand generate Br2 that is then released to the atmosphere. Sub-\nsequent photolysis of this Br2 generates Br radicals that can\nreact with and destroy O3. The BrO thus formed can then\nreact with HO2 to form HOBr. Altogether, this process is re-\nferred to as the \u201cBromine Explosion\u201d (Fan and Jacob, 1992;\nTang and McConnell, 1996; Vogt et al., 1996; Lehrer et al.,\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n7776 A. E. Jones et al.: Vertical structure of Antarctic tropospheric ozone depletion events\n2004). Environmental, as well as chemical conditions are\nalso critical for ODEs. Various studies have suggested a role\nfor temperature in driving ODEs (Tarasick and Bottenheim,\n2002; Jacobi et al., 2006) although this influence remains de-\nbated (Bottenheim et al., 2009). The role played by meteorol-\nogy has also been highlighted, with a critical influence both\non the onset of ODEs and on their termination (e.g. Hopper\nand Hart, 1994; Jones et al., 2006, 2009; Morin et al., 2005).\nSurface ozone has been measured at a relatively large\nnumber of coastal research stations in both the Arctic and\nAntarctica (Helmig et al., 2007), and these data have been\nused in the majority of ODE studies. Recently, measure-\nments of surface ozone over the frozen Arctic Ocean have\nbeen carried out from ships (Jacobi et al., 2006; Bottenheim\net al., 2009). In particular the Bottenheim et al. study has\ndemonstrated the capability for really sustained ozone de-\npletion within the sea ice zone. We note that ship-borne\nBrO measurements have also been carried out (Wagner et al.,\n2007; Po\u00a8hler et al., 2010).\nHowever, ODEs are 4-dimensional phenomena, with\nstructure in the horizontal and vertical components as well as\nin time. Relatively few measurements have been made of the\nvertical profile of ozone, given the demands of such a pro-\ncedure. Those that exist, however, have revealed important\ninformation. For example, it appears that ozone depletion\ngenerally extends from the surface up to a few 100 s of me-\nters, but that occasionally depletion to a few kilometres is ob-\nserved (Solberg et al. 1996; Friess et al., 2004; Bottenheim\net al., 2002; Strong et al., 2002; Tarasick and Bottenheim,\n2002; Ridley et al., 2003; Wessel et al., 1998). Sometimes\nozone depleted air can be observed at several kilometres alti-\ntude while ozone at the surface is normal (Wessel et al., 1998;\nRoscoe et al., 2001). Further, the vertical extent of an ODE\nappears to be strongly modulated by the physical behaviour\nof the atmosphere, with temperature inversions forming the\nupper boundary of depleted air masses (e.g. Wessel et al.,\n1998; Strong et al., 2002; Tarasick and Bottenheim, 2002).\nThe studies referenced above were all carried out using\nozonesondes on free-flying balloons. These balloons and\ntheir payload access the ozone profile throughout the whole\nof the troposphere providing information on, for example,\nthe height to which ODEs extend. They are highly effec-\ntive at providing the broad vertical picture. However, the\nballoons rise rapidly so that, with the ozone sonde time con-\nstant (\u223c100 s), the ozone profile is considerably smoothed\nin the vertical. As a result, much of the detail in the profile\nis not accessible. An alternative to a free-flying system is\noffered by tethered platforms, such as blimps. They are lim-\nited in height by the additional weight of the tether line, but\ntethered platforms enable slow controlled vertical ascent and\ndescent rates. They thus enable significantly enhanced mea-\nsurement resolution with vastly increased detail in the ozone\nprofile information. Only two tethersonde studies of spring-\ntime tropospheric ozone have previously been reported. In\nthe first, one Arctic ODE was probed in detail (Anlauf et al.,\n1994). The data, presented at a resolution of \u223c17 m, show a\nthermally-neutral layer depleted in ozone whose growth with\nheight was controlled by an inversion. In the second, the\nozone measurements were used to explore the vertical extent\nof snowpack and halogen chemistry in the Arctic (Tackett et\nal., 2007). No tethersonde measurements of ODEs have pre-\nviously been made in Antarctica.\nThere is thus considerable merit in both profiling tech-\nniques, with each revealing different, but complementary, in-\nformation.\nIn terms of data coverage, the overriding majority of ozone\nprofiling studies published to date have been carried out in\nthe Arctic. Thus far, only one study using ozonesondes\nto focus on the Antarctic troposphere has been published\n(Wessel et al., 1998), and a few profiles measured from on-\ngoing launch programmes at Neumayer and McMurdo sta-\ntions have been used as supporting data (Kreher et al., 1997;\nRoscoe et al., 2001; Frie\u00df et al., 2004).\nIn this paper we analyse data from two separate field\nexperiments and use the results to explore the characteris-\ntics and implications of low- and high-altitude tropospheric\nozone depletion events. The first, a tethersonde experiment\ncarried out in spring 2007, allows us to probe details in the\nlowest few hundred meters of the ozone profile and to ex-\nplore the influence of the complex layering within this re-\ngion of the atmosphere. The second was a programme of\nfree-flying ozonesondes that was carried out at Halley during\naustral spring 1987. The experiment was aimed at measuring\nprofiles of stratospheric ozone, and the observations made\nin the troposphere have not previously been analysed. The\ndata enable us to select cases of high altitude ozone depletion\n(i.e. extending of the order 1 to \u223c3 km above ground level)\nas a starting point for teasing out mechanisms driving ODE\nchemistry on wider spatial scales. The combined results en-\nable us to move towards a generalised picture of ODEs in\nAntarctica and assess their implications and the challenges\nfor modelling them both on local and regional scales.\n2 Location\nThe measurements reported here were made at the British\nAntarctic Survey station, Halley, in the Weddell Sea sec-\ntor of coastal Antarctica (Fig. 1). The tethersonde experi-\nment of 2007 was carried out at Halley V station (75\u25e635\u2032 S,\n26\u25e634\u2032 W) while the free-flying ozonesondes of 1987 were\nlaunched at the previous, but nearby Halley IV station\n(75\u25e636\u2032 S, 26\u25e642\u2032 W).\nHalley sits on the floating Brunt Ice shelf, 32 m above sea\nlevel. The surrounding area is snow-covered, but flat and\nfeatureless, with the nearest rock outcrops roughly 200 km\naway. Halley is roughly 15 km inland from the permanent\nice edge, and as the coast effectively forms a promontory at\nthis point, the station is close to the Weddell Sea in three di-\nrections. During springtime, the Weddell Sea is extensively\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 10, 7775\u20137794, 2010 www.atmos-chem-phys.net\/10\/7775\/2010\/\nA. E. Jones et al.: Vertical structure of Antarctic tropospheric ozone depletion events 7777\nFig. 1. Maps showing location of Halley station as well as other\nlocations referred to in the paper.\ncovered in ice, interspersed with open water leads, of note\nbeing a large polynya to the south west of Halley known as\nPrecious Bay (Anderson, 2003). To the east of Halley is the\ninland ice, and indeed, the prevailing wind direction at Hal-\nley is easterly. Beyond the grounding line to the south east\nof Halley, continental ice rises to the polar plateau. Katabatic\nwinds from the plateau descend towards Halley, but remain\naloft of the station, above a cold pool below (Renfrew et al.,\n2002). For a significant amount of the time during spring, air\narrives at the base from across the sea ice zone. There is thus\na range of air masses with different histories in the vicinity\nof Halley. Year-round measurements of BrO (as well as nu-\nmerous other trace gases) were performed at Halley during\nthe 2004\/05 CHABLIS (Chemistry of the Antarctic Bound-\nary Layer and the Interface with Snow) campaign (Jones\net al., 2008). The measurements, made using a long-path\nDOAS, revealed a springtime maximum, with highest mix-\ning ratios observed when air had been over the sea ice within\nthe previous 24 hours, but still present up to 6 pptv in air that\nhad spent at least 4 days over the continent (Saiz-Lopez et\nal., 2007). Subsequent modelling studies (Saiz-Lopez et al.,\n2008) suggested that BrO ought to be well mixed within a\n200 m springtime boundary layer.\n3 Methodology\n3.1 The 2007 tethersonde study\nA variety of instruments and techniques were used during\nthe 2007 experiment with measurements for surface ozone,\nground-based routine meteorology, sondes for measuring\nprofiles of ozone and temperature, and an acoustic radar that\nhighlights layers of atmospheric turbulence and thus provides\nconsiderable context for the profile data. Ideally, profiles of\nozone would be measured on a continuous basis, in order\nto provide maximum information. However, as tethersonde\nexperiments are highly labour-intensive, it was necessary in-\nstead to make targeted measurements. This was achieved us-\ning the surface ozone monitor: when a rapid decline in sur-\nface ozone mixing ratios was measured, an alarm triggered\nwhich alerted the overwintering staff to the onset of an event\nand the chance to initiate a profiling experiment. It is worth\nnoting that such tethered profiling work can only be carried\nout at relatively low wind speeds, so that all the ODEs probed\nusing this method occurred at Halley at wind speeds less than\n7 ms\u22121.\n3.1.1 Surface ozone and routine meteorology\nMeasurements of wind speed and direction are carried out on\na routine basis at Halley. The anemometers and wind vanes\nare located near to the main station, at a height roughly 10 m\nabove the snow surface. The data have an accuracy of about\n0.5 ms\u22121 for wind speed and 5\u25e6 for wind direction (Ko\u00a8nig-\nLanglo et al., 1998) and are available at 1-min resolution.\nSurface ozone was measured at the Halley Clean Air Sec-\ntor Laboratory (CASLab), which is located roughly 1 km\nsouth east of the station generators, and in a sector that re-\nceives minimal contamination from the base (Jones et al.,\n2008). Surface ozone was measured year-round during 2007\nusing a Thermo Electron Corp. model 49C. The instrument\nuses a UV absorbance technique and has a detection limit of\n1 ppbv (parts per billion by volume) and a precision of 1 ppbv\nfor 1-min averages of 10-s data.\n3.1.2 Blimp profiling system\nIn order to provide detail in the very lowest region of the at-\nmosphere, we employed a tethered AB400 blimp (Cameron\nBalloons Ltd) as the airborne platform, which allowed a con-\ntrolled and variable ascent\/descent rate. The blimp was able\nto carry a payload of \u223c2 kg (in addition to the tether line)\nand was made of lightweight fabric (LAM30) that had been\nused successfully in previous profiling experiments carried\nout at low temperatures (Rankin and Wolff, 2002). The blimp\nwww.atmos-chem-phys.net\/10\/7775\/2010\/ Atmos. Chem. Phys., 10, 7775\u20137794, 2010\n7778 A. E. Jones et al.: Vertical structure of Antarctic tropospheric ozone depletion events\nhad an internal volume of 11.3 m3, and was stored inflated\ninside a 4S Weatherhaven between experiments. A single\nreel (1000 m length) of 2 mm diameter Dyneema SK75 per-\nformance cord (Dynamic) (English Braids Ltd) was used as\nthe tether line, providing a balance between tensile strength\n(900 kg breaking load) and weight. The ascent\/descent rate\nfor the blimp was usually between 0.03 and 0.15 ms\u22121 (max-\nimum 0.25 ms\u22121), which, with the time constant of the ECC\nsonde (see below), yielded a vertical measurement resolution\nof between 4 and 19 m (varying from flight to flight) with a\nmean of 11 m.\n3.1.3 Vertical profiles of ozone and temperature\nOzone was monitored using an electro-chemical cell (ECC)\nsonde (Komhyr, 1969, 1995). The sondes were Science\nPump Corp. Model 5A, with customised electronics, pow-\nered by three 9 V lithium cells in parallel. No correction was\nrequired for reduction in pump speed with height given that\nthese were tropospheric measurements. However, below a\nbattery voltage of 2.9 V, the pump voltage would fluctuate,\nresulting in fluctuating pump speeds. Data were therefore\nrejected once the battery voltage dropped below 2.9 V. The\nother calibration factors vary by a few percent depending on\nthe concentration of KI and buffers, but the calibration is oth-\nerwise close to absolute (standard formula given by Komhyr\net al., 1995). For tropospheric measurements, where the par-\ntial pressure of ozone is small, errors in calibration are gener-\nally small compared to errors in determining the zero of the\nmeasurement (see below).\nBefore a flight, a sonde was prepared and the output sig-\nnal checked using an ozoniser set to deliver about 50 ppbv.\nThe zero was checked by sampling through an active char-\ncoal filter \u2013 if zero did not stabilise to within a few tens of\nmV of the zero of the electronics (250 mV) within 10 min,\nthe sonde was set aside and another prepared. The zero was\nagain checked outside before a flight.\nThe ozonesonde signal was transmitted to the ground via\nexternal inputs to a custom-made meteorological sonde. The\nmeteorological sonde included a wind vane, a radio trans-\nmitter (Radiometrix, 10 mW at 173 MHz), a temperature\ncompensated pressure sensor (Vaisala PTB100B, resolution\n0.1 hPa), a temperature sensor (Betatherm 1K7A329I, accu-\nracy 0.2 K), and 3 rotating wind cups on a near-vertical axis\nwith rotating disc and optical counter sampling speed for 1 s\nintervals. It also included a tilt compensated 3-axis compass\n(Honeywell HMR3300), incorporating a 2-axis accelerom-\neter allowing for up to 60 deg pitch and roll \u2013 this yielded\nwind direction, the sonde being fixed relative to the wind\nby its wind vane. The sonde used a microcontroller (Par-\nallax STAMP II) and a 14-bit digitiser with 8 channel multi-\nplexer (AD7856). Sensors were sampled once every 10 s be-\nfore powering the transmitter for a few ms to transmit data,\na procedure that avoided RF interference to the sensor sig-\nnals. The meteorological sonde was powered by a single 9 V\nlithium primary cell, which lasted many flights because of\nthe small duty cycle of the transmitter.\nThe height of the sonde was subsequently calculated from\nthe hydrostatic equation, and the ozone mixing ratio adjusted\nfor the ozonesonde time constant (previously determined to\nbe 100 s).\n3.1.4 Sodar\nA single axis, vertically pointing monostatic acoustic\nsounder (sodar) was used to gain qualitative information\nabout the physical structure of the lowest 600 m of the at-\nmosphere. This technique has been used in a previous study\nat Halley and is more fully described elsewhere (Anderson,\n2003; Jones et al., 2006). In brief, 10-s profiles of echo inten-\nsity are displayed as time-height images, or echogrammes,\nthat indicate the intensity of atmospheric turbulence within\na stratified atmosphere. Lack of echo can arise either from\nlack of stratification, or lack of turbulence, so an exact in-\nterpretation is not possible. However, some known fea-\ntures of the lower atmosphere are visible. For example, the\nechogrammes from Halley often reveal multiple horizontal\nlayering within the lower atmosphere which correlates with\nchanges in the vertical potential temperature gradient (more\nor less positive) (Anderson, 2003). The echogrammes also\ninclude signals of convection, and \u201cfossil convection\u201d. Fos-\nsil convection refers to the residual signal after convection\nis no longer active and can be explained as follows. During\nconvection, plumes of warm air rise from the surface. At the\nedge of these plumes there is both a temperature gradient and\nshear-generated turbulence, the combination of which gener-\nates strong sodar echo return. If the source of surface heating\nis removed, this echo structure takes some time (\u223chour) to\ndiffuse and disperse. Hence, although the convection is dead,\nthe sodar registers a blurred after-effect, described as \u201cfossil\u201d\nconvection (Culf, 1989).\nThe sodar used in this experiment was not able to probe\nthe atmosphere below \u223c20 m height due to ringing of the\nantennae, and the solid apparent echo shown in the figures\nis spurious. Spurious echoes are also generated by surface\nwinds in excess of 8 ms\u22121 as these cause wind noise around\nthe sodar antenna guy-lines. Finally, noise can be generated\nby people working near the antenna which is visible as thin\nvertical strips in the echogramme.\n3.2 The 1987 free-flying ozonesonde system\nA programme of ozonesonde flights was conducted at Hal-\nley IV during 1987 in order to study stratospheric ozone de-\npletion (Gardiner and Farman, 1988). ECC mark 3A son-\ndes (Science Pump Corp.) were used to determine partial\npressures of ozone at various heights and were operated ac-\ncording to Komhyr (1986). The ECC sondes were linked to\nVIZ 403 MHz radiosondes which transmitted the data back\nto the station. After a flight, the ozonesonde calibration was\nAtmos. Chem.

Data were transmitted every 20 s, which, with an\nascent rate of roughly 5 ms\u22121 yielded a vertical resolution of\nabout 100 m. Data were stored at standard pressure levels\nand at significant levels in the ozone profile, resulting in ir-\nregularly spaced vertical grids. Ozonesonde launches began\nin mid April and continued until late November. For the ma-\njority of that time, sondes were launched every ten days or so,\nbut from early August until late October they were launched\nroughly every 1 to 3 days, depending partly on weather con-\nditions. They were released on a routine basis at approxi-\nmately the same time on each launch day (\u223c16:00 GMT).\nThere were no surface ozone observations at Halley in 1987\nso we have only a 1-point measurement at ground level on the\ndays with launches and no information at all on days with no\nozonesonde launches \u2013 a fact that becomes important when\nanalysing the results.\n4 Results\n4.1 The 2007 tethersonde study\nDuring the 2007 austral spring, six tethersonde flights were\nachieved, with surface air masses in each case approaching\nHalley from the west or south-west (see Fig. 2b), i.e. across\nthe sea ice zone and\/or Precious Bay. The wind speeds dur-\ning each flight ranged from 1 ms\u22121 to 7 ms\u22121 (see Fig. 2c),\nso all cases probed were relatively low wind speed ODEs.\nThe timing of each flight relative to the condition of surface\nozone is shown on Fig. 2a, and it is clear that launches were\ncarried out during all stages of an ODE, i.e. during onset (24\nAugust 2007, 2 September 2007-flight a, 7 September 2007),\nat totality (21 August 2007), and during termination (25 Au-\ngust 2007, 2 September 07-flight b). The profiles of O3 and\npotential temperature measured during each experiment are\nshown in plots A and B of Figs. 3 to 8. Plot C of each fig-\nure shows the flight track of the tethersonde superimposed on\nthe sodar trace to show the different air masses encountered\nby the sonde. Plot D shows the corresponding time-series of\nO3 and potential temperature measured along the flight track.\nData were filtered according to battery voltage; once the volt-\nage started to drop, data were removed, so the amount of data\nrecorded varies with each flight. As such data have not pre-\nviously been assembled we examine them in some detail on\na case by case basis.\nODEs are often referred to as boundary layer events, with\nthe boundary layer top, or \u201cinversion\u201d, acting as the lid to the\ndepletion. Indeed, an inversion is classically defined as the\nregion of the boundary layer where the potential temperature\ngradient is positive. However, in polar regions, this becomes\nproblematic. A key feature of polar regions during winter\nand spring is the persistent, deep, continually stratified lower\natmosphere that is characterised by a positive temperature\ngradient throughout (Anderson and Neff, 2008).

The red lines indicate the mid-point of the tethersonde\nprofiling experiments.\na layer there is no inversion in the classical sense, and so no\nobvious upper limit to the boundary layer based on temper-\nature structure alone. For this reason, when presenting the\ntethersonde data we discuss atmospheric layering primarily\nin terms of the vertical potential temperature gradient, \u2202\u03b8\n\u2202z\n(z),\nand also the mixing height. The former gives an indication of\natmospheric stratification, and the latter the height to which\nmixing can be expected. To further assess degrees of mixing\nwe calculate the Richardson number (Ri) when data quality\nallows. Ri is a measure of the balance between turbulence\ngeneration (by wind shear) and turbulence suppression by\nstratification (i.e. potential temperature gradient), and is de-\nfined as:\nRi= g\nT\n\u2202\u03b8\n\/\n\u2202z(\n\u2202U\n\/\n\u2202z\n)2 (1)\nwhere U is the wind speed, g is the acceleration due to grav-\nity (=9.81 ms\u22122), T is ambient temperature (K). Ri is thus\na measure of stability (and hence degree of mixing) within\nan air mass; small Ri (large shear and small stratification)\nimplies strong turbulence and hence strong vertical mixing;\nlarge Ri implies suppression or even absence of turbulence,\nand hence low or zero mixing. Traditionally, a critical value\nwww.atmos-chem-phys.net\/10\/7775\/2010\/ Atmos. Chem. Phys., 10, 7775\u20137794, 2010\n7780 A. E. Jones et al.: Vertical structure of Antarctic tropospheric ozone depletion events\nof Ri=0.25 is taken to be the transition from one regime to\nthe other (Stull, 1988), although fluxes (and hence turbu-\nlence) are still observed in the environment at super-critical\nRi (Galperin et al, 2007). As Ri is based on gradients it is\nsensitive to measurement error, especially winds, and the rel-\natively short sample time of U at each level means the Ri\nestimate will have error of up to 50%.\n4.1.1 Profile experiment 21 August 2007\nDuring the flight of 21 August 07, ozone was almost com-\npletely depleted in a layer extending from ground level to\n\u223c30 m (Fig. 3b). This layer was characterised by a strong\ngradient in potential temperature, \u2202\u03b8\n\u2202z\n, i.e. was highly strati-\nfied, and Ri within this layer was \u223c0.4, indicating intermit-\ntent or limited mixing. Between 30 m and 40 m there is a\nclear discontinuity in both O3 and \u03b8 , and above this discon-\ntinuity, little change in either O3 or \u03b8 is visible up to the\n175 m range of this flight. For the region from 40 m to 120\nm, it is possible to calculate Ri. Even though \u2202\u03b8\n\u2202z\nis small (see\nFig. 3a), Ri is large (>1.4) driven by the very weak wind\nshear (not shown). The result implies that this region of the\natmosphere is laminar and that mixing is negligible.\nThe sodar echogramme (Fig. 3c) shows little in the way of\nair mass structure above 40 m. Below 40 m, the echogramme\nshows a strong continual echo between 30 m and 40 m.\nWithin the lowest 30 m there is evidence of residual struc-\nture, likely to arise from fossil convection (see Sect. 3.1.4).\nThe atmosphere thus appears to be split into two masses;\na depleted layer extending from the surface to \u223c30 m and\na layer above \u223c40 m with background ozone mixing ratios.\nBetween is a transition region some 10 m deep.\nDuring descent, no structure is evident in either \u03b8 or O3 un-\ntil the sonde reaches the region of fossil convection (Fig. 3c\nand d), when small scale structure is again evident in both.\nThe ozonesonde battery voltage dropped just after the instru-\nment had once again entered the transition region, so below\nthis altitude data have been filtered out.\n4.1.2 Profile experiment 24 August 2007\nDuring this flight, the ground-based surface ozone measure-\nments (Fig. 2a) show that ozone was only partially depleted\nand that the ODE was still developing. The profile in po-\ntential temperature (Fig. 4a) shows a well-defined and ex-\ntremely shallow layer extending from the ground to \u223c10 m\nheight. This layer is also visible in the sodar echogramme\n(Fig. 4c) which, after some initial wind noise, shows a shal-\nlow (\u223c20 m) near-surface turbulent layer which decreases\nin height during the flight. Interestingly, there is no equiv-\nalent discontinuity in ozone visible from the sonde profile\n(Fig. 4b). According to these data, ozone mixing ratios were\ndepleted, but roughly constant from the surface to a height\nof \u223c80 m, and above this altitude, mixing ratios gradually\nreturned to background amounts. The potential temperature\nFig. 3. Tethersonde profiling experiment of 21 August 2007.

By comparing (C) and (D) it is possible to see at what altitude,\nand in which air mass, measurements of ozone and \u03b8 were made.\ndata show that above the 10-m discontinuity, the atmosphere\nis stratified throughout, and indeed, there is no turbulence\nsignal on the sodar echogramme.\nOur interpretation of these data is that a relatively warm\nair mass, already depleted in ozone, was transported across\nthe sea ice zone towards Halley. As it traversed the ice shelf,\nthe heat from the air mass was absorbed by the radiatively-\ncooled snow surface, generating the strong gradient in poten-\ntial temperature. The rate of ozone depletion, however, was\nnot affected, so the signals in ozone and potential tempera-\nture are effectively decoupled.\n4.1.3 Profile experiment 25 August 2007\nThe flight of 25 August 2009 revealed more complex vertical\nprofiles, with three distinct air masses probed. The greatest\nozone depletion was evident in the well-defined and highly-\nstratified layer that extended to \u223c20 m above the ground\n(Fig. 5a and b). Heat was flowing down a thermal gradi-\nent from the atmosphere into the radiatively-cooling snow\nsurface below at about 5 Wm\u22122 as measured by a sonic\nanemometer at 4 m (not shown). Ozone mixing ratios in-\ncreased to between 15 and 20 ppbv in the region between\n\u223c20 m and \u223c80 m while \u2202\u03b8\/\u2202z, although small, remained\npositive (indicating stratification). From \u223c80 m to \u223c100 m,\na transition zone is evident, characterised by an increase in\nstratification (\u2202\u03b8\/\u2202z=0.08 Km\u22121), and within which ozone\nmixing ratios increased rapidly. The sodar data (Fig. 5c)\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 10, 7775\u20137794, 2010 www.atmos-chem-phys.net\/10\/7775\/2010\/\nA. E.

Please note the\ndifference in scales.\nshow a clear layer of increased backscatter, indicating en-\nhanced turbulence within this region. This layer is either\nbeing generated in situ by wind shear, or is a remnant of\npast shear action (fossil turbulence, see Culf, 1989); for this\nevent, the wind profile data are not of sufficient quality to\naddress this uncertainty. Above 100 m, ozone mixing ratios\nreached, and remained at background amounts of roughly\n30 ppbv to the top of the flight track at 200 m. On the de-\nscent flight, the \u223c100 m turbulent layer was still evident in\nthe sodar echogramme (Fig. 5c) and, according to the sharp\ndiscontinuity in ozone (Fig. 5a and d), was acting as a signif-\nicant barrier to mixing.\nWe interpret these data as indicating three main air masses,\nwith different histories that had been retained. Interestingly,\nin this example, a correlation between ozone and potential\ntemperature is maintained in the lowest layer of the atmo-\nsphere.\n4.1.4 Profile experiment 2 September 2007 \u2013 daytime\nflight\nThe first flight on 2nd September was carried out mid-\nafternoon during the onset of an ODE. It revealed a series\nof layers in the atmosphere between the ground and the\nupper reaches of the sonde (see Fig. 6). The lowest was,\nonce again, a well-defined and very shallow layer, reach-\ning only \u223c15 m above the ground (Fig. 6a and b). Higher\nup were two clearly-defined air masses that contained well-\nmixed ozone, i.e. with little or no vertical gradient. The\nfirst spanned the region between \u223c60 m and 180 m, and was\ncharacterised by ozone mixing ratios of \u223c20 ppbv and small\npotential temperature gradient (<0.01 Km\u22121 ), i.e. neutrally\nstratified. The second extended above 250 m to the top of the\nprofile (\u223c370 m), with ozone mixing ratios of \u223c28 ppbv and\n\u2202\u03b8\n\/\n\u2202z=0.02 Km\u22121. A region of mixing, with a clear gradient\nin both O3 and \u03b8 , lay between 180 m and 250 m.\nFig. 5. As for Fig. 3, but now for 25 August 2007. Please note the\ndifference in scales.\nFig. 6. As for Fig. 3, but for the first flight on 2 September 2007.\nPlease note the difference in scales.\nThe surface winds on this occasion were light, \u223c2 ms\u22121,\nbut the profile of wind speed, and more significantly, wind\ndirection (not shown) reveals that the two air masses were\nquite distinct. In the lower region, the air originated from the\n270\u25e6\u00b120\u25e6 sector (West), while in the upper region, the air\nmass originated from 55\u25e6\u00b110\u25e6 sector (North East). Within\nthe transition region, the winds drop to zero, and backs via\nNorth. In the lower region there is a local maximum in wind\nspeed, (from near zero at the surface, and zero again in the\ntransition region). Given the neutral stratification, the wind\nshear in this region should produce a well mixed air mass. In\nthe upper region, the winds increase monotonically through-\nout, with \u2202U\n\/\n\u2202z=0.033 s\u22121. This gives Ri=0.7, implying\nvery weak mixing.\nThe sodar data show two associated echo layers within\nthe transition region, and we interpret these as the upper and\nlower limits of the shear region, where the air masses are slid-\ning over each other. The clear difference in wind direction\nwww.atmos-chem-phys.net\/10\/7775\/2010\/ Atmos. Chem. Phys., 10, 7775\u20137794, 2010\n7782 A. E.

Please note the difference in scales.\nimplies a different history for the air masses, the lower being\nrecently advected over the ocean, the upper being continental\nair (King, 1989, 1993).\n4.1.5 Profile experiment 2 September 2007 \u2013 night-time\nflight\nA second flight was carried out late on 2nd September which\nwas only able to measure to 85 m altitude. Above this height,\nthe battery failed, probably because of the lower tempera-\ntures. It was dark during this flight, and, according to the\nsurface ozone measurements (Fig. 2a), the ODE was in its\nrecovery stage. Figure 7a shows that the lowest atmospheric\nlayer was extremely shallow, extending to less than 10 m\nabove the ground, but that, again, this structure was not re-\nflected in the ozone profile (Fig. 7b). During the dark, ozone-\ndepletion chemistry would not be active, so a strong correla-\ntion between \u03b8 and O3 would not necessarily be expected.\n4.1.6 Profile experiment 7 September 2007\nThe final tethersonde flight of this campaign was carried out\non 7 September during daylight hours (Fig. 8). According\nto the surface ozone data (Fig. 2a), the air measured at Hal-\nley was only partially depleted, and the sonde was launched\nclose to the maximum depletion observed. Battery voltage\nwas good to \u223c140 m on the ascent flight.\nThe flight shows three distinct atmospheric layers. A\nstrong positive potential temperature gradient extends from\nthe surface to\u223c20 m indicating highly stratified air (Fig. 8a).\nThis structure is not matched by structure in the ozone pro-\nfile (Fig. 8b). These data suggest an air mass whose poten-\ntial temperature structure is still evolving en route to Halley,\nwhile ozone has not changed. Between 20 m and 100 m, the\npotential temperature gradient is much weaker, but nonethe-\nless positive and therefore stratified. No significant change\nFig. 8. As for Fig. 3 but now for the flight of 7 September 2007.\nPlease note the difference in scales.\nin ozone is measured over this distance. However, between\n100 m and 120 m, there is a transition zone with clear dis-\ncontinuities in both ozone and potential temperature. Above\n\u223c120 m, ozone mixing ratios return to background amounts\n(\u223c30 ppbv).\nThe sodar (Fig. 8c) shows associated echo return within\nthe lowest 20 m, and again within the transition zone around\n100 m altitude. Thus far, the event is similar to that of the\nfirst flight on the 2nd of September (above), except in the\namount of ozone depletion near the ground. Further similar-\nity is observed in the winds, where, although not reversing in\ndirection, the easterly component of the wind increases with\nheight by 2 ms\u22121 within the transition zone, implying again\nmaritime air advected underneath continental air. Further ev-\nidence is apparent in the sodar data, where fossil convection\nis quite plain within the 20 m to 100 m depleted zone, sug-\ngesting that the air has recently traversed a polynya, with as-\nsociated convection (Anderson, 1993; Culf, 1989).\n4.1.7 Tethersonde study: implications\nThis was the first concentrated assessment of the detailed\nvertical structure of a number of ozone depletion events.\nThe overall technique used to study ODEs, using tethersonde\nlaunches triggered by surface ozone data, worked well, with\na number of ODEs probed and under a variety of stages of\ndepletion. The tethersonde was able to probe the lowest few\nhundred meters in considerably greater detail than could be\nachieved using a free-flying sonde.\nThe tethersonde study revealed the enormous complexity\nwithin the lowest layers of the atmosphere and the influ-\nence exerted by atmospheric structure and dynamics on ob-\nserved ozone profiles. The observations suggest that numer-\nical modelling studies aimed at reproducing ODEs observed\nat coastal sites will need to account in some detail for the\ninfluence of atmospheric dynamics on ozone mixing ratios.\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 10, 7775\u20137794, 2010 www.atmos-chem-phys.net\/10\/7775\/2010\/\nA. E. Jones et al.: Vertical structure of Antarctic tropospheric ozone depletion events 7783\nSuch data would then provide excellent constraints against\nwhich to test ideas on local ozone depletion processes. It is\nalso clear that the lowest atmospheric layer at Halley can be\nextremely shallow at times, something that is more closely\nassociated with sites on the Antarctic plateau.\nThe data, further, highlight the difficulty in defining a rel-\nevant boundary layer height. This issue is important, for\nexample, when translating a measured surface flux into a\nboundary layer concentration, and also when deriving a mix-\ning ratio from a slant or vertical column density. Assessment\nof mixing height would therefore seem a welcome compan-\nion to many chemical measurement programmes. Further,\nconsiderable variability can exist in the profile of ozone, and\nit appears that concentrations can be influenced by several\nphysical layers at different heights. For example, a signifi-\ncantly lower mixing height can be rapidly established as air\nmoves from over the convective sea ice zone (mixing height\nof the order 100 m) to over the stably stratified ice shelf (mix-\ning height \u223c20 m). We note also that the relationship be-\ntween ozone and potential temperature (\u03b8) can be very sub-\ntle, and that correlations do not always exist between these\nparameters \u2013 especially near the ground.\nFinally, as the blimp profiling system cannot be deployed\nunder windy conditions, the low altitude profiles reported\nhere are, by definition, all relatively low wind speed events\n(\u223c1 ms\u22121 to \u223c7 ms\u22121). Low wind speed ODEs are often\nassociated with local depletion (e.g. Simpson et al., 2007),\nand indeed two local ODEs previously studied at Halley\nwere measured at wind speeds between zero and \u223c5 ms\u22121\n(Jones et al., 2006). The majority of the tethersonde pro-\nfiles reported here appear to arise from local processing un-\nder quiescent conditions, and it is interesting to note that the\nozone depletion is restricted to the lowest 10 s to \u223c100 m\naltitude. Maps of BrO measured by the satellite-borne\nSCIAMACHY (SCanning Imaging Absorption SpectroMe-\nter for Atmospheric CHartographY) instrument (Richter et\nal., 1998; Bovensmann et al., 1999) (not shown), indicate\nno major increases in the BrO column in the Halley region\nduring the ODEs measured by the tethersonde. This may be\nlinked to the low sun at the time of satellite overpass over\nHalley at this time of the year but alternatively may imply\nthat on these occasions the local production of bromine com-\npounds was not sufficient to significantly enhance the BrO\ncolumn. In terms of export of halogens or of air low in ozone\nthat might affect the radiative balance of the atmosphere, it\ntherefore appears that low wind speed ODEs, driven by local\nprocessing, have few wider atmospheric implications. Their\nmerit, however, lies in their providing excellent cases against\nwhich to test kinetics and chemical mechanisms involved in\ndepleting polar tropospheric ozone.\n4.2 The 1987 free-flying ozonesonde study\n4.2.1 Time-series of ozone profiles\nData from the free-flying ozonesonde study show consider-\nably less fine-scale detail than the tethersonde profiles de-\nscribed above, but enable a much broader view to be gained\nof ozone behaviour throughout the troposphere. Figure 9\nis a contour plot derived using measurements from all the\nozonesonde launches between 26 July 1987 and 14 Novem-\nber 1987. The dots represent the individual data points and\nhence show the data coverage, the degree of smoothing in the\ndiagram and the days when no sonde launches were made.\nThe lack of at least daily data coverage becomes problem-\natic later, when trying to understand mechanisms driving\nhigh altitude ozone depletion by linking with meteorologi-\ncal information available at 6-hourly resolution. The reason\nfor the lack of sonde launch varies \u2013 sometimes due to the\nplanned schedule, but sometimes due to high wind speeds, a\nfact which becomes relevant later.\nThere are various features in Fig. 9 that are immediately\nobvious. Firstly, the data coverage varies quite considerably\nduring this period shown. For example, from 2 August to\n6 September, sondes were launched every day. In contrast,\nfrom 7 September to 15 September there were only 3 sonde\nlaunches. Also obvious are the ODEs, indicated by the blues\nof the false colour scale, which were measured between 22\nAugust and 7 October. The vertical extent of the ODEs varies\nconsiderably. There are various occasions when depletion\nextends only to a few hundred meters above the ground (e.g.\n25\/26 August and 7 October). However, there are also pro-\nfiles showing ozone depletion to several kilometres altitude,\nto a maximum of \u223c3.5 km on both 29 September and 3 Oc-\ntober. Of note also are two dislocated events, where ozone at\nground level shows unperturbed background concentrations,\nbut by an altitude of roughly 200 m, significant depletion\nis apparent. Such ODEs are, by definition, unattainable by\nsurface measurements, and are an example that the ground-\nbased record does not reveal the complete picture regarding\nODEs. Studies aimed at addressing trends in ODEs would\nneed to take that into account.\nThe data thus hold significant amounts of information, but,\nas the record is somewhat limited by periods when no son-\ndes were launched, they must be interpreted with care. For\nexample, a severe ODE is evident on 22 August with less ex-\ntensive depletion apparent on 25 and 26 August. However,\nas there were no sonde launches on 21, 23 or 24 August, and\nwith the lack of surface O3 observations in 1987, it is not\npossible to say when this event started or whether this was a\nsingle long event or two shorter ones. The sonde data must\nbe viewed as a series of snapshots.\nThey can nevertheless considerably extend our under-\nstanding of ODEs that occur at Halley. For example, a key\nquestion that can be addressed with these data is: what drives\nODEs to such remarkable altitudes? Given that the depletion\nwww.atmos-chem-phys.net\/10\/7775\/2010\/ Atmos. Chem.

We ex-\nplore this issue in the rest of this paper, focussing on events\nwhere ozone depletion was evident in the profile up to and\nabove 1 km altitude. We initially consider the air mass ori-\ngin of dislocated events using 5-day back trajectories. We\nthen consider profiles where depletion is continuous upwards\nfrom ground level, and the regional meteorological situation\naround the time of the profile measurements.\n4.2.2 Origin of the dislocated events\nBack trajectories were calculated for both of the dislocated\nevents using the on-line trajectory model of the British At-\nmospheric Data Centre (fully described at http:\/\/badc.nerc.\nac.uk\/community\/trajectory\/). The trajectories were calcu-\nlated using meteorological fields from the ECMWF at a res-\nolution of 2.5\u25e6, the maximum available for this time period,\nand were run backwards from Halley for 5 days. In each\ncase trajectories ending at different pressure levels were cal-\nculated in order to provide information on the history of air\nmass at different heights in the ozone profile.\nFigure 10a and b show the histories of air arriving over\nHalley on 21 and 28 September. On each occasion, air\nat ground level shows unperturbed concentrations of ozone\nwhile those at altitude show significant depletion. The back\ntrajectories show that in both cases, air arriving close to\nground level (980 and 950 hPa) had originated over the cold\ncontinent to the east of Halley. Air arriving at higher alti-\ntudes, shown by the sonde data to be depleted in ozone, had\na) b)a) b)\nFig. 10. 5-day back trajectories showing the contrasting origin of\nair arriving at different altitudes at Halley.

On 21 September the route\nwas over the frozen southern Weddell Sea with an approach\nto Halley from the south west. On 28 September, air had\noriginated much further north, tracked the coastal fringes of\nthe sea ice zone and finally arrived at Halley from a north\neasterly direction. The maritime origin is confirmed by data\nfrom radiosonde launches carried out separately but on the\nsame day. The humidity profile in the radiosonde data (not\nshown) reveals, in both cases, an increase in moisture in the\nozone-depleted layer. The fact that the profile at Halley was\ndislocated thus appears to be driven simply by different large-\nscale air mass origins. This conclusion is in line with obser-\nvations reported by Wessel et al. (1998) where an ozonesonde\nlaunched at Neumayer station (8\u25e6 W, 70\u25e6 S) revealed air with\nlimited ozone depletion at ground level that was overlain by\na highly depleted air mass. Wessel et al. explained their ob-\nservation as cold katabatic surface winds, originating over\nthe continental ice shelf, lifting up warmer and less dense\nmarine air masses that had lower ozone mixing ratios. We\nreturn to this later.\n4.2.3 The broader picture\nTo further explore the drivers of high altitude ODEs we con-\nsider charts of mean sea level pressure (mslp), together with\nAtmos. Chem.

Halley is marked by the black circle on the plots.\n10-m wind vectors (which indicate the speed and direction of\nwinds at 10 m above the ground), to gauge the regional me-\nteorological situation around the time of the observed ODEs.\nWe utilise the European Centre for Medium Range Weather\nForecasts (ECMWF) 40-year reanalysis (ERA-40), which is\ndescribed in Uppala et al. (2005). The reanalysis has been\nretrieved on a Gaussian N80 grid, with a grid cell spacing of\n\u223c125 km.\nIn the relevant plots the 10-m wind speed vectors are clas-\nsified by a series of colours according to their speed. The\nthresholds were chosen according to a study on an Antarc-\ntic ice shelf (Mann et al., 2000) which concluded that when\nthe 10-m wind speed reached between 8 ms\u22121 and 12 ms\u22121\n(shown in amber on the plots) particles of snow or ice were\ndislodged from the snow surface and bounced into a \u223c10 cm\ndeep \u201csaltation layer\u201d. At 10-m wind speeds in excess of\n12 ms\u22121 (shown in red on the plots) particles were lofted out\nof the saltation layer and formed what is classically referred\nto as blowing snow. ERA-40 wind vectors are likely to give a\ngood indication of wind speed, and therefore reflect whether\nsnow was lofted or blowing.\nFigure 11a shows the profile of ozone as measured us-\ning the free-flying balloon-sonde on 22 August 1987. The\nfigure also shows an un-depleted profile from the middle of\nthe same month. The degree of ozone depletion is clear, ex-\ntending from ground level to \u223c2000 m altitude. Figure 11b)\nshows the mslp chart for the preceding day, 21 August 1987,\nwith a huge low pressure system situated off-shore of Halley\nand encompassing the majority of the Weddell Sea area. The\n10-m wind vectors on 21 August 1987 are shown in Fig. 11c)\nand their colouring shows that over large areas, snow\/ice will\nbe lofted either into a saltation layer or higher into the at-\nmosphere as blowing snow. Unfortunately no sonde was\nlaunched from Halley on 21 August 1987 precisely because\nof the high winds. By 22 August 1987, ERA-40 charts show\nthat the depression is still present over the Weddell Sea, but\nthat it is much less intense than on the 21st.\nFigure 12a shows the ozone profile on 21 September 1987,\nthe first dislocated event for which we calculated trajectories,\nabove. Again a typical un-depleted profile from the middle\nof the month is also shown, and it is clear that on 21 Septem-\nber 1987, ozone is depleted to \u223c2000 m, but with the largest\nbite from the profile extending from \u223c200 m to \u223c1000 m.\nThe back trajectories in Fig. 10a show that the air originating\nwithin the most depleted layer arrived at Halley from over\nthe southern Weddell Sea. Figure 12b shows the mslp on\nthis day, and the presence of a large, moderately deep low\npressure system over the Weddell Sea. Figure 12c shows that\nthe wind speeds at 10-m maximise in the 8 ms\u22121 to 12 ms\u22121\nrange, suggesting that snow and ice would be lofted into a\nsaltation layer. The air, shown by the back trajectory analysis\nto arrive at altitudes over Halley of between 900 and 800 hPa,\nwith its route across the southern Weddell Sea, is thus highly\nlikely to have been impacted by the depression. The follow-\ning day the winds were too high to launch a sonde, so we\nhave no information on whether depletion was sustained.\nThe ozonesonde launched on 24 September 1987 shows\nsmall but limited amounts of depletion in the ozone profile\n(not shown). That launched on 25 September 1987, in con-\ntrast, shows clear and significant depletion in the ozone pro-\nfile to over 2000 m altitude (see Fig. 13a). From the mean\nsea level plot of the 24 September 1987 (Fig. 13b), a sig-\nnificant low pressure system was situated offshore of Halley\non this day. The associated winds (Fig. 13c) are just below\nthe 12 ms\u22121 threshold in the vicinity of Halley, and above\n12 ms\u22121 on the western side of the Weddell Sea. Thus, the\natmosphere on the day prior to the depleted profile measure-\nment was significantly impacted by the storm, but no re-\nsponse was evident at that time in the Halley profile. On\n25 September 1987, it is clear from the ERA-40 data (not\nshown) that the depression, although still present, was con-\nsiderably weaker than on the 24th. By the 26 September\n1987, although depletion is still evident in the ozone pro-\nfile (Fig. 14a), the centre of the depression had shifted north-\nwards (Fig. 14b) and the wind speeds across the Weddell Sea\nhad eased considerably (Fig. 14c). It is likely that the de-\npletion evident on the 26th was a remnant of earlier ozone\ndestruction.\nwww.atmos-chem-phys.net\/10\/7775\/2010\/ Atmos. Chem. Phys., 10, 7775\u20137794, 2010\n7786 A. E.

The\nback trajectory calculation (Fig. 10b) shows that air in the\nlayer between 900 and 700 hPa (\u223c3000 m) had passed over\nthe sea ice zone to the north west of Halley before arriving\nover the base. The mean sea level plot for 27 September 1987\n(Fig. 15b) shows that a large low pressure system was present\nin this area on the day before the depleted profile was mea-\nsured at Halley. The 10-m wind speed vectors suggest that\nthe depression resulted in considerable amounts of blowing\nor saltating snow in the atmosphere (Fig. 15c). Similar to\nthe event described above, mslp and 10-m wind vector charts\n(not shown) indicate that on 28 September, the low was still\npresent although weaker, but with wind speeds still sufficient\nto cause suspended snow.

The ozonesonde released at Halley on 29 Septem-\nber shows that ozone depletion extended from the surface to\nwell over 3000 m altitude (Fig. 16a) most likely a remnant of\nprocessing over the previous days.\nThe final sonde launch of 1987 that showed ozone deple-\ntion at considerable altitudes was that of 3 October. The\nsonde was launched around 1600, and Fig. 17a) shows that\ndepletion was evident from the surface to \u223c2500 m, with a\nmaximum around 800 m altitude. ERA-40 mslp charts over\nthe preceding time period show that a low pressure system\nwas present over the Weddell Sea on 3 October which was\nat its most intense at 0600, i.e. 10 h before the sonde launch\n(see Fig. 17b). The associated 10-m wind vectors (Fig. 17c)\nsuggest that the atmosphere would have been influenced by\nlofted and blowing snow in the Halley region around 06:00.\nNo significant depletion is evident in the ozonesonde launch\nof 2 October. These data help to provide some time con-\nstraints for ozone processing and suggest that significant de-\npletion can occur within 10 h of the low pressure maximum.\n4.2.4 Free-flying ozonesonde study at Halley:\nconclusions\nIn a recent paper we derived a relationship describing the\nlikelihood of ODEs based upon wind speed (see Jones et al.,\n2009, Fig. 12d). The pre-requisite of low wind speeds and a\nstable boundary layer has been described by a number of au-\nthors (e.g. Jacobi et al., 2006; Jones et al., 2006; Simpson et\nal., 2007). In addition, Jones et al. (2009) demonstrated that\nODEs can develop under conditions of high winds and blow-\ning snow. The conclusion was arrived at from a detailed case\nstudy around Halley and the Weddell Sea in which an active\nODE appeared to be generated during an intense Antarctic\nstorm. Ground-based measurements at Halley showed that\nduring the storm, saline blowing snow was lofted into the\natmosphere. Concurrent satellite data revealed an extensive\nregion of enhanced BrO across the Weddell Sea. These ob-\nservations added considerable support to two 3-D modelling\nstudies of Yang et al. (2008, 2010) which suggested that\nblowing snow events over sea ice could be a major source of\nsea salt aerosol, and that this aerosol could in turn generate\nbromine that would destroy tropospheric ozone. No informa-\ntion about the vertical profile of ozone was available for the\nHalley case study.\nwww.atmos-chem-phys.net\/10\/7775\/2010\/ Atmos. Chem. Phys., 10, 7775\u20137794, 2010\n7788 A. E.

Halley is marked by the black circle on the plots.\nWindy conditions in themselves are of course not suffi-\ncient to drive ozone depletion, and the 1987 observations\nclearly demonstrate this point. For example, on 24 Septem-\nber 1987, a large and vigorous low pressure system was\noperative across the Weddell Sea, with lofted and blowing\nsnow likely present in the region of Halley. However, the\nozone profile measured at Halley on this day did not reveal\nsignificant ozone depletion. An interesting feature revealed\nby the ERA-40 surface temperature charts is that tempera-\ntures across the Weddell Sea were significantly higher on 24\nSeptember than on the following day when ozone depletion\nwas observed to over 2 km. Further, ODEs observed under\nconditions of high wind speeds can arise from transport to\nthe observation site of air masses already depleted in ozone\n(e.g. Simpson et al., 2007). Thus separating out the role of\nlow pressure systems, into chemically driving depletion as\nopposed to transporting already-depleted air masses, is no\nsimple task.\nSo, windy conditions are not a sufficient, but are a neces-\nsary condition. It is clear from the data presented here that all\nthe 1987 events with high altitude ozone loss were associated\nwith significant atmospheric depressions, windy conditions,\nand lofted or blowing snow. In each case, the low pressure\nsystem preceded the measurement of the depleted profile, but\nunfortunately the temporal resolution of the data is too lim-\nited to allow a clear statement on the timescales involved in\nprocessing and depletion which might be used to test\/confirm\nthe mechanisms proposed by Yang et al. (2008, 2010).\n5 Discussion\n5.1 Re-visiting earlier published studies\nAlthough the analyses from 1987 Halley are very consistent,\nthese are a limited number of events measured at a single\nlocation. In order to expand our dataset, we consider here\npublished ozone soundings made at other Antarctic stations\nthat also show high altitude ozone loss. To gain the broader\npicture, we again turn to ECMWF re-analyses. For the pe-\nriod up to 2001 we utilise the ERA-40 reanalysis (described\nearlier), and for more recent data we analyse the ECMWF In-\nterim Reanalysis, which starts in 1989 and is updated to the\npresent time. The latter has also been retrieved on a Gaussian\nN80 grid, with a grid cell spacing of \u223c125 km.\nWessel et al. (1998) focussed on dynamical processes oc-\ncuring during ODEs observed at Neumayer station in austral\nspring 1993. They highlighted three dislocated events, the\nmost intense featuring depletion to \u223c3000 m altitude. From\nback-trajectory calculations, they concluded that the dislo-\ncation arose because air low in ozone, with a source over\nthe sunlit sea ice, was uplifted over continental air. They\nfurther noted that the ozone-depleted air was transported to\nNeumayer by marine cyclones that developed over the ice-\ncovered South Atlantic Ocean. Although the discussion was\nin terms of transport, rather than as a key player in the deple-\ntion process, a clear link was nonetheless made between high\naltitude ODEs and low pressure systems.\nA paper by Kreher et al. (1997) presents a number of ozone\nprofiles, and extends the picture by including halogen data.\nThey describe measurements of BrO made in austral spring\n1995 at Arrival Heights, part of the New Zealand station on\nthe edge of the Ross Sea (77.8\u25e6 S, 166.7\u25e6 E). The observa-\ntions were made with a zenith sky DOAS (Differential Opti-\ncal Absorption Spectrometer) at high solar zenith angle (86\u25e6\nand 90\u25e6) \u2013 i.e. twilight dawn and dusk. In particular, they\nfocus on two events with enhancement in tropospheric BrO,\nthe first from dusk on 24 to dusk on 26 August and the sec-\nond from dusk on 15 to dusk on 16 September. The authors\nlink their BrO data with ozonesonde measurements made at\nthe nearby McMurdo station on 25 August and 15 Septem-\nber, which show depletion in the profile to several kilometres\naltitude. We studied the ERA-40 meteorological charts for\nthat region and time period, and found that on 23 August,\nthe day before enhanced BrO was observed, a low pressure\nsystem was situated in the area which by noon was over the\nRoss Sea. By 18:00, its position was such that, as well as en-\nhancing katabatics descending from the Antarctic Plateau, it\nwas drawing air from the sea ice zone to Arrival Heights (see\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 10, 7775\u20137794, 2010 www.atmos-chem-phys.net\/10\/7775\/2010\/\nA. E. Jones et al.: Vertical structure of Antarctic tropospheric ozone depletion events 7789\nFig. 18a). Wind speeds were sufficiently high to cause salta-\ntion and blowing snow (Fig. 18a). The storm lasted through\nthe night but ERA-40 charts show that it eased over the fol-\nlowing day, such that by 18:00 on 24th, 10-m wind speeds\naround Arrival Heights were below the threshold for lofted\nsnow. A similar situation arose around the time of the sec-\nond enhanced BrO event. An atmospheric depression, cen-\ntred over the boundary between the Ross Ice Shelf and the\nRoss Sea on 14 September resulted in high wind speeds in\nthe region around Arrival Heights and generally high winds\nacross the whole area (Fig. 18b). By the following day, when\nthe BrO enhancement was first measured, the low had moved\nto the western side of the Ross Sea and winds around Arrival\nHeights were dominated by katabatic flow, although still high\nenough for saltation (not shown).\nA subsequent paper by Roscoe et al. (2001) used the re-\nsults of Kreher et al. (1997) and expanded them to include\nsome additional data from Neumayer. Specifically, the au-\nthors considered zenith sky DOAS and ozonesonde measure-\nments from Neumayer that showed enhanced tropospheric\nBrO on 2 August 1995 that coincided with an ozone pro-\nfile that was severely depleted to \u223c3 km altitude. ERA-40\ncharts show that on 1 August 1995, a moderate depression\nwas situated offshore of Neumayer, with winds in the coastal\nregion above the threshold for saltating and blowing snow\n(see Fig. 18c). By 2 August, this low pressure system had\neased considerably, although, according to ERA-40 charts\n(not shown), wind speeds were still sufficient to loft snow\ninto a saltation layer. No ozone sonde was launched on 1\nAugust, so we have no way of knowing the state of the ozone\nprofile during the windier preceding day. Again, however, a\nhigh altitude ODE and enhanced BrO were associated with\nan atmospheric low pressure system.\nIn a more recent paper, Frie\u00df et al. (2004) focused on mea-\nsurements made at Neumayer station in austral spring 1999\nand 2000. Their data set included zenith sky DOAS obser-\nvations of BrO as well as ozone soundings and they inter-\npreted their results in the context of duration of sea ice con-\ntact. From their data they derived a meteorological scenario\nto describe conditions responsible for depletion in the ozone\nprofile, in which an air mass located over the sea ice is driven\nsouth towards the station by an eastward moving depres-\nsion. They further note that air masses from the sea ice are\ntransported to altitudes of \u223c4000 m by advection processes\ncaused by cyclonic activity above the ice covered ocean. We\ndiscuss the Frie\u00df et al. paper further below.\nThus, in all previous studies of Antarctic ozone profiles,\nthere is either a stated link to low pressure systems, or a link\nthat can be derived by some additional analysis (using the\nERA-40 charts). There are also the first hints of a link be-\ntween low pressure systems and BrO.\n\u00a0\na)\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nb)\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nc)\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFig. 18.

(2009) and Yang et al. (2008, 2010)\ndescribed above raise the idea that atmospheric low pressure\nsystems with sufficient wind speeds to loft saline blowing\nsnow can be a source of bromine to the atmosphere with the\npotential to deplete tropospheric ozone. Considerable evi-\ndence to support this idea can be found within earlier publi-\ncations. For example, Kreher et al. (1997) note that the initial\nphase of both BrO events they observed coincided with high\nsurface winds and blowing snow. Frie\u00df et al. (2004) note that\nmost periods of elevated BrO were accompanied by strong\nenhancement in O4 absorption, a diagnostic for tropospheric\nlight path. The authors suggest that, as well as snow drift, it\nwas very likely that the light path enhancement was at least\npartially caused by sea salt aerosol.\nwww.atmos-chem-phys.net\/10\/7775\/2010\/ Atmos. Chem. Phys., 10, 7775\u20137794, 2010\n7790 A. E. Jones et al.: Vertical structure of Antarctic tropospheric ozone depletion events\nImportantly, satellite observations of BrO are available\nfrom the GOME (Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment) in-\nstrument (Richter et al., 1998; Burrows et al., 1999) from\n1996 to 2004, so are available for the period of measurements\nreported by Frie\u00df et al. (2004). Indeed maps of BrO total\nvertical column density (VCD) are presented for a number of\ndays to support the zenith sky DOAS observations reported\nin the Frie\u00df et al. paper.\nWe are thus able to combine, for some days, observations\nof surface ozone, the ozone profile, BrO from both ground-\nbased zenith sky DOAS and satellite-borne imaging, together\nwith ERA-40 charts of regional meteorology. We refer to\ndata published by Frie\u00df et al. where it exists, and supplement\nwith other sources where necessary. We focus on the three\ndays from the Frie\u00df et al. paper that show the most severe\ndepletion in the surface ozone record.\nFirstly, on 9 September 1999, Frie\u00df et al. show that mea-\nsured surface ozone was \u223c5 ppbv; the ozonesonde launched\nthat day shows that the depletion extended to roughly 1.5 km\naltitude; the zenith sky DOAS shows a simultaneous in-\ncrease in BrO above background. In addition, we present in\nFig. 19a) ERA-40 charts of mean sea level pressure and 10-m\nwind vectors. They reveal a major low pressure system over\nthe Weddell Sea, with wind speeds in excess of 12 ms\u22121, that\nis co-located with a cloud of enhanced BrO (see Frie\u00df et al.,\n2004) .\nEqually severe depletion is evident in the surface\nozone record for 11 September 1999, and again, BrO\nobserved by the DOAS is enhanced. No ozone pro-\nfile data is presented in the Frie\u00df et al. paper for this\nday, but the profile is available from the Neumayer\nweb service (http:\/\/www.awi.de\/en\/infrastructure\/stations\/\nneumayer station\/observatories\/meteorological observatory\/\ndata access\/upper air soundings\/full vertical resolution\/)\n(Ko\u00a8nig-Langlo, 2007a). Ozone depletion (not shown) is\nclear to roughly 3 km altitude. The GOME map for 11\nSeptember 1999 shows an extensive cloud of BrO to the\nnorth of Neumayer, which, according to the ERA-40 charts\nof mslp and 10-m wind vectors (Fig. 19b), again coincides\nwith a vigorous atmospheric low pressure system.\nOn 23 September 2000, the third example, Frie\u00df et al.\nshow that surface ozone is depleted to \u223c5 ppbv, while BrO\nis enhanced. They further present GOME BrO showing a\n\u201chotspot\u201d offshore of Neumayer. The ozone profile, again\nfrom the Neumayer web service (Ko\u00a8nig-Langlo, 2007b),\nshows that ozone depletion extended to roughly 2 km alti-\ntude, and the ERA-40 charts show a low pressure system off-\nshore of Neumayer (see Fig. 19c). This case raises the issue\nof timing, as the low pressure system of 23 September is the\nresidual of a more vigorous system that was influencing the\nNeumayer region over the previous two days.\nThe maps and charts presented in Fig. 19 also show other\noccasions of coincident low pressure systems and enhanced\nBrO. These are particularly evident around the Ross Sea,\nwith a very clear example being the BrO hot spot and low\n\u00a0\na)\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nb)\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nc)\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFig. 19.

Neumayer is\nmarked by the blue circle on the plots.\npressure system on 23 September (Fig. 19c and Frie\u00df et al.,\nFig. 13).\nRecently it has been shown by Theys et al. (2009) that\nsome enhancement in total BrO column can be caused by in-\ncreases in stratospheric BrO due to a decrease in tropopause\nheight coincident with low surface pressure. For the cases\nwe have discussed here, tropospheric BrO columns (derived\nusing climatological data validated using ground-based bal-\nloon and satellite limb stratospheric BrO observations) indi-\ncate the same structure of BrO enhancements that are evi-\ndent in the total column, with tropospheric column amounts\nup to 8\u00d71013 molec\/cm2 (N. Theys personal communication,\n2010). Given that calculated stratospheric columns at south-\nern high latitudes range from 2.5 to 4.5\u00d71013 molec\/cm2\n(Theys et al., 2009), the BrO hotspots shown in the BrO to-\ntal column cannot be attributed to the stratosphere and must\narise from a tropospheric source.\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 10, 7775\u20137794, 2010 www.atmos-chem-phys.net\/10\/7775\/2010\/\nA. E. Jones et al.: Vertical structure of Antarctic tropospheric ozone depletion events 7791\nIt thus appears from this ensemble of data and analyses\nthat high altitude ozone depletion events are associated with\natmospheric low pressure systems, but that the association\narises as a product of the BrO generation and concomitant\nozone destruction, and not merely as a result of advective\nprocesses.\n5.3 Why atmospheric low pressure systems?\nSatellite imagery and high resolution meteorological analy-\nses reveal that there is a spectrum of atmospheric low pres-\nsure systems in high southern latitudes from the mesoscale\n(less than 1000 km horizontal resolution) \u201cpolar lows\u201d to\nsynoptic-scale depressions with a diameter of 2000 to\n3000 km. Polar lows tend to have a lifetime of less than\n24 h, but they can be very vigorous with winds in excess\nof gale force (Rasmussen and Turner, 2003). The synoptic-\nscale lows usually have a lifetime of several days, although\nthe detailed structure of the systems can change considerably\nduring its evolution.\nOn satellite imagery most depressions are characterised by\nhaving the cloud organised into comma-shaped or spirali-\nform bands, which often define the boundaries between air\nmasses. The imagery also shows that many polar lows de-\nvelop in the southerly air flow to the west of a large depres-\nsion during cold air outbreaks.\nBy definition, all low pressure systems are associated with\nlow level convergence and general ascent, with divergence\nat upper levels. However, the cloud bands indicate areas of\nparticularly marked ascent, and models and radar data have\nshown that the air flow in these areas consists of a number of\n\u201cconveyor belts\u201d, streams of rapid advection with slope, and\nnot just simple ascent up a frontal surface. A warm conveyor\ntakes air from the surface to the upper levels of the cyclonic\nsystem, the air being replaced by the descending cold air.\nLarger depressions can have ascent from the surface to the\nupper troposphere.\nPolar depressions thus provide the conditions for high\nwind speeds, and thereby blowing snow, at ground level, and\na mechanism to transport processed air to considerable alti-\ntudes.\nWhile blowing snow appears to contribute to the mech-\nanism for ODEs at high wind speeds, this mechanism de-\npends critically on there being sufficient salinity in the snow.\nSimpson et al. (2007) reported that saline snow was ubiq-\nuitous on first-year sea ice and contained significant quan-\ntities of salts necessary for halogen activation. Around the\ncoast of Antarctica, the seasonal variation in sea ice extent\nis enormous, ranging from the annual maximum (roughly\n18 million km2) to the minimum (roughly 2.5 million km2).\nThere is thus an enormous reservoir of first-year sea ice\naround Antarctica with the potential for halogen activation.\n5.4 What about the Arctic?\nAn obvious question that arises at this point is whether this\nmechanism also operates in the Arctic. The Arctic and\nAntarctic sea ice zones are very different. Geographically,\none is a frozen ocean surrounded by land masses while the\nother is peripheral to a large continent. As a result of the dif-\nfering topography, there are considerable differences in me-\nteorology in the two polar regions. The frozen Arctic Ocean\nis dominated by high pressure systems while the sea ice zone\naround Antarctica is subject to repeated lows. Early Arctic\nwork by Hopper et al. (1998) linked high pressure systems\nwith ozone depletion to 200\u2013400 m altitude and sustained\nsurface ozone depletion within the sea ice zone. More re-\ncent measurements, also made within the Arctic sea ice zone,\nhave also found sustained surface ozone loss during extended\nperiods of high pressure (Jacobi et al., 2006; Bottenheim et\nal., 2009). Further, a recent paper (Jacobi et al., 2010) has\nfound that low pressure systems moving northwards into the\nCentral Arctic from mid-latitudes are associated with tran-\nsitions to higher mixing ratios of ozone, more typical of\nremote background sites, and that ozone mixing ratios are\nstrongly negatively correlated to atmospheric pressure during\nsuch events. This is the opposite conclusion to our findings\nfor Antarctica, and highlights the existence of critical differ-\nences between the Arctic and Antarctic atmospheric systems.\nHowever, although we have not explored in any detail the\npotential for low pressure systems in the Arctic to drive high\naltitude ozone depletion or major enhancement to the BrO\ncolumn, it appears that it can occur. A particularly striking\nexample can be found between 25 and 28 March 2007, dur-\ning which time satellite observations of both total and tro-\npospheric column BrO from the SCIAMACHY instrument\nshow an enormous area of enhanced BrO covering approxi-\nmately half of the Arctic Ocean basin (Begoin et al., 2010).\nAt the same time, ERA-40 meteorological charts show a\nhuge and windy depression, not only covering the same re-\ngion, but propagating eastward in tandem with the BrO (see\nBegoin et al., 2010). We derived 10-m wind speed vectors\nfor this event and found that wind speeds were indeed suffi-\ncient for lofted and blowing snow (plots not shown). Such a\nmeteorological situation is unusual in the Arctic, so how im-\nportant this mechanism is for ozone depletion, particularly to\nhigh altitudes, and for the production and export of halogens\nfrom the Arctic, remains an open question and goes well be-\nyond the scope of this paper. Given the changing state of\nthe Arctic, and projected future changes, however, it seems\nimportant to assess the contribution and how this might de-\nvelop as the Arctic warms and coverage of first year sea ice\nincreases.\nwww.atmos-chem-phys.net\/10\/7775\/2010\/ Atmos. Chem. Phys., 10, 7775\u20137794, 2010\n7792 A. E. Jones et al.: Vertical structure of Antarctic tropospheric ozone depletion events\n6 Summary and conclusions\nThis paper has probed low- and high-altitude features of\nozone depletion events using two different profiling methods\nas well as a variety of supporting data. The results suggest a\nnumber of generalised features.\nFrom the tethersonde data, the low altitude ODEs were\nhighly constrained by the complex layering within the tropo-\nsphere and were often confined within an extremely shallow\nlowest layer. Satellite images of BrO at the time of the tether-\nsonde launches show no significant enhancement to the BrO\ncolumn. If we associate (as a first pass) enhanced BrO with\ndepleted ozone, then this result suggests that the impact on\nthe wider atmosphere from Antarctic ODEs generated un-\nder low wind speeds and quiescent conditions is limited. It\nmay be that their value lies more in providing constrained\ncase studies against which mechanistic understanding can be\ntested. Numerical model studies that aim to reproduce ODEs\nobserved under low wind speeds will need to consider the\nrole played by small scale features in boundary layer and the\nresultant influence on ozone mixing ratios.\nThe results from the 1987 ozonesonde programme suggest\nthat in Antarctica, profiles of ozone depletion to significant\naltitude are associated with high wind speed, low pressure\nsystems. We have shown, further, that Antarctic depres-\nsions are also associated with enhanced BrO. Previous au-\nthors have suggested that transport into the free troposphere\nof air depleted in ozone may have implications for the re-\ngional radiative budget and that this same transport may have\nsignificant implications for the budget of halogens in the free\ntroposphere (e.g. Roscoe et al., 2001; Frie\u00df et al., 2004). Our\nanalyses strongly suggest that, when considering the wider\nimplications of Antarctic tropospheric ODEs, it is the large,\nenergetic low pressure systems that appear to be able to both\nprocess larger air masses and export them to lower latitudes.\nSuch events are thus likely to drive the regional (or wider)\nimpact of ODEs around Antarctica. The degree to which the\nfree troposphere is altered by ODE chemistry in the future\nwill therefore also be strongly influenced by any changes that\nmay occur to such meteorological systems.\nTo test these ideas about high altitude Antarctic ODEs and\ntheir association with atmospheric depressions, a programme\nof high temporal resolution ozonesonde launches, or obser-\nvations with an ozone DIAL (Differential Absorption Lidar),\nwould be required. Thus far, the frequency of sonde launches\nlimits our conclusions to the broad-scale because of the mis-\nmatch in timing between the occurrence of low pressure sys-\ntems and the launch of the ozonesonde. Higher temporal res-\nolution data would enable hypotheses to be tested in numer-\nical models and detailed understanding of the mechanisms\ninvolved to be developed and confirmed. A systematic study\nof Arctic data is also now timely.\nAcknowledgements.
