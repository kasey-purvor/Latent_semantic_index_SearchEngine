INTRODUCTION 44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n66 \n67 \n68 \nComparative studies have made an invaluable contribution to our knowledge of extinction risk \nin a wide range of taxa.  These studies have demonstrated that some species are at greater risk \nthan others because they possess biological traits that predispose them towards extinction (e.g. \nlarge body size) and\/or they occur in areas of intense anthropogenic disturbance (e.g. high \nhuman population density) (e.g. Cardillo et al. 2005; Fisher et al. 2003; Jones et al. 2003; \nOwens & Bennett 2000; Purvis et al. 2000; Reynolds et al. 2005).  By enhancing our \nunderstanding of these patterns, and the mechanisms that underpin them, this research allows \nus to predict the future vulnerability of species and to improve the efficacy of conservation \nplanning.  However, the translation of science into action on the ground requires that the \nknowledge gained from these emergent species-level analyses can be reliably applied to local \nsites, where conservation management is implemented.  Unfortunately, there are challenges to \nthis process, not least because the local mechanisms responsible for driving population declines \nmay be both variable across a species range and difficult to detect or identify when analyses are \nconducted at the species level.  As a result, the extent to which this application can be made is \npoorly known (Fisher & Owens 2004; Purvis et al. 2005).  This is an important gap in our \nknowledge for two reasons.  First, there has been a proliferation of species-level studies over \nthe last decade, yet there remains uncertainty about how we can most effectively apply their \nfindings.  Second, without this information it is difficult to know how we might best improve \nthe quality of our science to make it more useful to conservation practitioners in the future. \n In order to address this problem, we investigate how the risk of population extinction \nacross species varies across a range of sites subject to a range of human pressure.  Such \nanalyses require a taxonomic group that is sufficiently well-studied to provide reliable data on \nlocal-scale population change across a variety of different species and sites in response to a \nspecific threat process (a single threat focus is necessary, since different threats can lead to \n 3\ndifferent patterns of species response, confounding the interpretation of emergent patterns: \nIsaac & Cowlishaw 2004).  We therefore looked at the responses of primate populations to \ntimber extraction (selective logging).  Primates are among the most threatened of all mammals \n(Cowlishaw & Dunbar 2000), which in turn are one of the most important \u201cflagship\u201d groups for \nconservation (Ceballos et al. 2005), while timber extraction is one of the most important threats \nto tropical forest biodiversity (Asner et al. 2005; Curran et al. 2004).   \n69 \n70 \n71 \n72 \n73 \n74 \n75 \n76 \n77 \n78 \n79 \n80 \n81 \n82 \n83 \n84 \n85 \n86 \n87 \n88 \n89 \n90 \n91 \n92 \n93 \n In the first part of our analysis, we ask what is the magnitude of the variation in \npopulation decline between species and sites. In the second part of our analysis, we investigate \nwhat factors might explain this variation.  At the site level, we test four hypotheses about \nextrinsic (environmental) factors: that species declines will be more severe where there has \nbeen less time for forest recovery and where logging was more damaging (Dunn 2004), where \nthere is more seasonal environmental stress (Wright 1992), and where there is more ecological \ncompetition (Peres & Dolman 2000).  At the species level, we test five hypotheses about \nintrinsic (biological) factors: that species will be more vulnerable if they have slow \nreproductive rates (reproductive rate is related to recovery rate at small population sizes) \n(Johnson 2002; Reynolds 2003), high ecological requirements (Jones et al. 2001; Woodroffe & \nGinsberg 1998), low ecological flexibility (Vazquez & Simberloff 2002), a high dependence on \nconspecifics (Courchamp et al. 1999), and a high dependence on the forest canopy (Harcourt \n1998).  These hypotheses are in line with those tested in previous comparative studies of \nextinction risk (e.g. Cardillo et al. 2005; Fisher et al. 2003; Owens & Bennett 2000; Reynolds \net al. 2005), including studies of primates (Harcourt 1998; Isaac & Cowlishaw 2004; Johns & \nSkorupa 1987).  We also investigate whether the relationship between each explanatory \nvariable and species vulnerability is a function of body size (following Cardillo et al. 2005).   \n \n \n 4\n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 94 \n95 \n96 \n97 \n98 \n99 \n100 \n101 \n102 \n103 \n104 \n105 \n106 \n107 \n108 \n109 \n110 \n111 \n112 \n113 \n114 \n115 \n116 \n117 \n118 \nChanges in population abundance were collated from published studies and quantified as a \nresponse ratio (r), i.e. the abundance of a population in an area of logged forest divided by its \nabundance in a matching area of unlogged forest.  Hence, a value of r=1.0 indicates no change \nin abundance, but values above and below one indicate an increase and decrease respectively, \nwhile a value of zero indicates extinction.  Response ratios provide a useful metric for the \nmeasurement of effect size in ecological research (Hedges et al. 1999), and in this case allowed \nus to compare across studies that used different units of abundance, such as individual density, \ngroup density, and group encounter rates along transect.  We used the natural logarithm of the \nresponse ratio (response ratio + 1.0) to linearize the metric and normalize the data (following \nHedges et al. 1999), and ran our statistical models with Normally distributed errors. The \nassumptions of Normality and homoscedasticity were tested post-modelling by examining the \nstandardised residuals versus both the normalised scores and the fixed part predictions (the \nformer gave a straight-line plot, whilst the latter was a cloud of points, supporting our model \nassumptions). \nThe full dataset contained 293 response ratios across 66 primate species at 34 sites, and \nis provided in the electronic supplementary material accompanying this paper (see also Isaac & \nCowlishaw 2004).  Sites were defined as distinct geographic areas, e.g. national parks, although \nthese areas were variable in size.  At these sites, logged forest areas and matching unlogged \n(control) forest areas were defined following the authors of the original studies, on the basis of \nthe presence\/absence of selective logging, habitat similarity, and spatial proximity.  At eleven \nsites, data were collected from several (n=2-6) areas (\u201cplots\u201d) that experienced logging at \ndifferent times and to different levels of timber extraction.  In total, 38 species and 26 sites \noccur more than once.  Data were discarded where additional disturbances, such as hunting or \nhabitat fragmentation, had a significant presence.  \n 5\nThe hypotheses under test, and their associated explanatory variables, encompassed \nboth extrinsic (site) and intrinsic (species) factors.  The four hypotheses about extrinsic factors \nrequired data collected at the site level (or plot level within site, where appropriate) and were \ntaken from the source papers for the response ratios.  The four key variables comprised: (1) \nrecovery time (years since logging); (2) damage at logging, given by the % loss of trees (where \ndamage was reported by extraction rate it was converted into % tree loss using relationships \nderived from those studies that used multiple damage measures: Chapman et al. 2000; Johns & \nSkorupa 1987); (3) seasonal environmental stress (climatic seasonality, indexed by site \nlatitude); and (4) ecological competition, using two different indices: the number of  congeneric \nspecies, and the number of  primate species occupying a similar niche (i.e. same diet [frugivore, \nfolivore, insectivore] and habit [arboreal, terrestrial]: Rowe 1996), at that site. \n119 \n120 \n121 \n122 \n123 \n124 \n125 \n126 \n127 \n128 \n129 \n130 \n131 \n132 \n133 \n134 \n135 \n136 \n137 \n138 \n139 \n140 \n141 \n142 \nThe five hypotheses about intrinsic factors required species-level data that were taken \nfrom the wider literature.  The full dataset is given in the electronic supplementary material (see \nalso Isaac & Cowlishaw 2004).  Although patterns in species traits at the site level would also \nbe of interest, these are unavailable in almost all cases, and are only likely to show minimal \nvariation relative to interspecific patterns.  The five hypotheses under test involved eight \nspecies traits: (1) species reproductive rate\/recovery potential was indexed by gestation period \n(days) and population density (individuals km-2); (2) species ecological requirements was \nindexed by body mass (female, kg), home range size (ha), and frugivory (% feeding time eating \nfruit and seeds); (3) species ecological flexibility was measured indirectly as the range of \nenvironmental variation to which the species is naturally exposed (i.e. the annual temperature \nrange and rainfall seasonality at the centre of the species\u2019 geographic range: Cowlishaw & \nHacker 1997; Isaac & Cowlishaw 2004); (4) species dependency on conspecifics was indexed \nby group size (individuals); and (5) species dependency on the forest canopy was indexed by \n 6\ndegree of terrestriality (% time spent at or below 5m \u00b1 2m in the canopy).  All data were loge \ntransformed prior to inclusion in the models. \n143 \n144 \n145 \n146 \n147 \n148 \n149 \n150 \n151 \n152 \n153 \n154 \n155 \n156 \n157 \n158 \n159 \n160 \n161 \n162 \n163 \n164 \n165 \n166 \n167 \nWe used Generalised Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) (Goldstein 2003) to model our \ndata and to establish statistical significance. This approach is necessary to partition the variance \nin response into between- and within-species components, as well as allowing for differences \nwithin and between sites.  Our data were structured such that each observation referred to a \nparticular species at a given site at a specific point in time: most sites contain several species, \nand most species occur at several sites. In other words, we have multiple observations of \nindividual species across a varying number of sites, such that individual data points are not \nmutually independent.  We therefore used cross-classified GLMMs, implemented in MLwiN \n(Rasbash et al. 2000), to partition the variance appropriately and to test the significance of these \nrandom effects (i.e. observation, species, and site). These were then mapped onto a unique \nclassification set (Browne et al. 2001) that provided a means for controlling for repeated \nobservations within sites and species.  Our model thus took the form: \nyi = \u001fX + uspecies(k)  + usite(j) + ei \nwhere the value y of the ith observation was modelled by the overall mean \u03b2 together with \nrandom departures uspecies due to the species (k) in question, random departures usite referencing \nthe site (j) in which the observation was made, and individual-level random departures ei for \neach specific observation (Rasbash et al. 2000; Rasbash & Goldstein 1994).  Fixed effects, X, \nwere explanatory variables that were added in the normal manner.  The final model was a \nminimum adequate model obtained through backwards deletion that included all extrinsic and \nintrinsic variables.  We ran our models for 5x105 iterations using a Markov-chain Monte Carlo \nalgorithm (Goldstein 2003). \nWe also modelled other forms of potential non-independence in our data by fitting \nadditional random effects that represent spatial scale (continent, and plot within site) and other \n 7\nlevels of taxonomy (suborder, infraorder, genus, and family).  Taxonomy above the species \nlevel followed Groves (2001), with the exception of the Platyrrhini & Catarrhini which we \ntreated as infraorders.  \n168 \n169 \n170 \n171 \n172 \n173 \n174 \n175 \n176 \n177 \n178 \n179 \n180 \n181 \n182 \n183 \n184 \n185 \n186 \n187 \n188 \n189 \n190 \n191 \n192 \n \n3. RESULTS \nAn initial summary of these data for each site and species (Figure 1) indicates that both show \nconsiderable variation around the median response ratio (r).  The site-level variation (Figure \n1a) may simply reflect differences in the species composition of the different sites.  \nAlternatively, this variation may reflect genuine differences between sites, such that the same \nspecies has responded in dissimilar ways at different sites.  Such differences could be the result \nof natural environmental variation (e.g. some sites might be ecologically more vulnerable, or \ncontain more competitors) or anthropogenic variation (although we have controlled for threat \ntype, there may still be differences in threat intensity).  The presence of genuine differences \nbetween sites is supported by the pattern of species-level variation (Figure 1b).  This figure \nreveals a remarkable degree of intraspecific variability, such that while on average most species \npopulations decline following logging (rmedian<1.0 for 20\/35 species), most of these declining \nspecies also show an increase in abundance following logging in some instances (maximum \nr>1.0 for 13\/20 species).   \nTo explore this pattern in more detail, we investigated how variation in the response \nratio is partitioned across the hierarchical levels of both taxonomic classification (suborder, \ninfraorder, family, genus, and species) and spatial scale (continent, site, and plot within site).  \nWe found no significant variance between suborders, infraorders, families or genera (all \nP>0.1), reflecting the fact that species median response ratios to logging show no phylogenetic \nsignal (Isaac & Cowlishaw 2004).  We also found no significant variance due to intercontinent \nor interplot differences.  However, there was significant variation elsewhere.  Specifically, we \n 8\nfound that differences between species account for 18.4% of the total variance, and differences \nbetween sites account for a further 20.2% of the total variance.  (The remaining 61.4% is \nresidual error that incorporates other unexplained sources of variance, including measurement \nerror).  This result indicates that, although species show consistent differences in their patterns \nof population decline, there is also comparable variability within species that is related to local \nsite differences. \n193 \n194 \n195 \n196 \n197 \n198 \n199 \n200 \n201 \n202 \n203 \n204 \n205 \n206 \n207 \n208 \n209 \n210 \n211 \n212 \n213 \n214 \n215 \n216 \n217 \nWe then explored what factors might explain these patterns of variation.  We began by \nexploring extrinsic site-level factors.  In the four hypotheses under test, we found no support \nfor an influence of logging damage (% tree loss), seasonal environmental stress (latitude), or \necological competition (number of competitor species at site).  However, there was a strong \neffect of recovery time (time since logging): X21=9.69, P<0.002.  Thus, population declines are \nrecorded as less severe at those sites where there has been more time for recovery since timber \nextraction.  We then tested our five hypotheses about species vulnerability by adding the eight \nintrinsic species characteristics to our recovery-time effect model.  Our results indicate that \nslow reproductive rate (long gestation period), high ecological requirements (large home \nrange), and low ecological flexibility (small annual temperature range at the centre of the \nspecies geographic range) are all associated with a population decline following timber \nextraction, as predicted (table 1).  In addition, an unexpected positive body-mass effect was \nalso obtained.  No other variables were statistically significant in the model.  We also found no \nsignificant interactions between any intrinsic or extrinsic fixed effect and body size (all P>0.1). \nThe predictions of our model are illustrated in Figure 2.  In the case of recovery time \n(time since logging), the response ratios are at their lowest immediately following logging and \ngradually ascend towards a value of one (the baseline population abundance in undisturbed \nforest) over the following 50 years.  In contrast, the four species traits vary across the baseline.  \nThus, some species characteristics are associated with a population decline following logging \n 9\n(e.g. small body size, long gestation period) while others are associated with an increase (e.g. \nlarge body size, short gestation period) when all other effects are held constant. \n218 \n219 \n220 \n221 \n222 \n223 \n224 \n225 \n226 \n227 \n228 \n229 \n230 \n231 \n232 \n233 \n234 \n235 \n236 \n237 \n238 \n239 \n240 \n241 \n \n4. DISCUSSION \nThe main purpose of our study has been to enhance our understanding of how patterns of \nextinction risk at the species level might translate to the local scale where conservation action is \nusually implemented.  We have sought to do this through an exploration of how patterns of \nvariation in local population decline can be influenced by both species biology and site \ncharacteristics.  Our results indicate that, at the local level, the nature of the site can explain as \nmuch variation in patterns of population decline as the biology of the species.  This finding \nbuilds on two previous strands of work. The first investigated how well species-level traits can \npredict population-level time to extinction (O'Grady et al. 2004; Saether et al. 2005) and \nminimum viable population size (Brook et al. 2006; Traill et al. 2007) across a variety of \nspecies.  The second investigated biological correlates of local population decline in exploited \nmarine fish, in comparisons between areas of high and low exploitation (Jennings et al. 1998; \nJennings et al. 1999), inside and outside marine reserves (Mosquera et al. 2000), and over time \n(Dulvy et al. 2000) (see also Reynolds et al. 2005).  Both areas of research have provided \npioneering insights into the links between species- and population-level vulnerability to \nextinction.  But to date only the latter work in marine fisheries has incorporated site-specific \ninformation in their analysis, specifically the level of threat (harvesting pressure).  To our \nknowledge, ours is the first study to incorporate information on threat intensity together with \nthe wider environmental characteristics of the site, and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 to assess the \nrelative importance of species-level and site-level characteristics in determining the emergent \npatterns of population decline. \n 10\nRecent studies at the species level have established that a full explanation of variation in \nspecies global declines requires an understanding of both the species biological traits and the \nthreat processes that drive these declines (Cardillo et al. 2005; Fisher et al. 2003; Owens & \nBennett 2000; Reynolds et al. 2005).  Our analysis at the site level demonstrates that the same \nholds true for the understanding of local declines.  This is an important result, because it is at \nthis spatial scale where the mechanisms of population regulation and extinction operate, and \nwhere conservation ultimately takes place.  In addition, the present study adds another layer of \ncomplexity to our knowledge of extinction processes.  Previously, we have shown that \nindividual species exhibit different patterns of decline in response to different threat types (e.g. \nhunting and habitat disturbance), and to the different anthropogenic processes that comprise \nthese threats (e.g. selective logging and shifting cultivation, within habitat disturbance) (Isaac \n& Cowlishaw 2004).  Here we show that different responses can also emerge within these \nspecific anthropogenic processes (in this case, selective logging), and that these responses are \ninfluenced by local processes (i.e. recovery time).  This intraspecific variation indicates that the \nmechanisms involved in most species declines are likely to be heterogeneous and complex.  \nOne implication of this heterogeneity for analytical study is that we should therefore approach \n\u201ctypical\u201d values for species susceptibility to decline with caution (especially when such values \nare based on data drawn from only a handful of sites).   \n242 \n243 \n244 \n245 \n246 \n247 \n248 \n249 \n250 \n251 \n252 \n253 \n254 \n255 \n256 \n257 \n258 \n259 \n260 \n261 \n262 \n263 \n264 \n265 \nIn light of these results, it is also apparent that patterns of intraspecific variation contain \nuseful information, and that we should make full use of this information wherever possible.  \nThis is well illustrated by an earlier analysis of the same dataset used here, based solely on \nmedian response-ratio values, that only managed to detect one of the four species traits \nassociated with population decline following logging, namely ecological flexibility (i.e. annual \ntemperature range at the centre of the species geographic range) (Isaac & Cowlishaw 2004).  \n 11\nThe difference between these two studies also highlights the strengths of GLMMs over more \nconventional statistical approaches in such analyses.   \n266 \n267 \n268 \n269 \n270 \n271 \n272 \n273 \n274 \n275 \n276 \n277 \n278 \n279 \n280 \n281 \n282 \n283 \n284 \n285 \n286 \n287 \n288 \n289 \n290 \nMoreover, our study has allowed us to obtain a more textured understanding of how \ncertain biological traits can influence extinction risk.  Most notable among our species-level \nresults is the relationship between population response ratio and body mass.  While larger \nspecies are usually identified as more vulnerable due to their slower reproductive rates and \nhigher ecological demands (Purvis et al. 2000), our results show that once these effects are \ncontrolled body mass can have a positive influence.  Several previous studies have reported \ncomparable findings across island communities of both shrews (Peltonen & Hanski 1991)and \nbirds (Cook & Hanski 1995) once the effects of population size were controlled.  Similarly, \nOwens & Bennett (2000) reported that larger birds are less susceptible to habitat disturbance.  \nThese patterns have been attributed to the fact that bigger species have larger energy reserves \n(Lindstedt & Boyce 1985), making them better able to survive periods of food scarcity.  The \nrelationship between body mass and extinction risk is thus more complex than often assumed.  \nMore recent modelling work suggests that the best body size to minimise extinction risk is \ncontingent upon the type of environment: larger species are at lower risk of extinction than \nsmaller species in fluctuating environments, but at greater risk of extinction when catastrophes \noccur (Johst & Brandl 1997).    \nIn addition to the body mass effect, gestation period, ecological flexibility (indexed by \nannual temperature range at the centre of species geographic range), and home range size also \ninfluenced the pattern of population response, in each case in the predicted direction.  When \nthese patterns are assessed in relation to the baseline of \u2018no change\u2019 (r=0) (Figure 2), it is also \nclear that certain species characterised by particular biological traits may benefit from logging.  \nThis is most clear for the fast reproducers (short gestation periods) and more adaptable species \n(those naturally occurring in more variable environments).  This pattern is consistent with the \n 12\nfact that these traits tend to characterise those primate species that colonise more variable \nhabitats such as secondary forest (Ross 1992), a habitat associated with logged forest areas (e.g. \nCowlishaw & Dunbar 2000).  Nevertheless, while these relationships provide useful insights \ninto the mechanisms that might underpin primate responses to logging, and the associated traits \nthat might act as indicators of vulnerability, it should also be remembered that a considerable \nproportion of the variance in our analysis still remains unexplained.  No doubt some of this \npartially reflects methodological differences between studies, including measurement error, but \nother factors are also likely to be involved that it has not been possible to include here, e.g. \nforest regenerates more quickly following logging at some sites than at others (Lawes & \nChapman 2006). \n291 \n292 \n293 \n294 \n295 \n296 \n297 \n298 \n299 \n300 \n301 \n302 \n303 \n304 \n305 \n306 \n307 \n308 \n309 \n310 \n311 \n312 \n313 \n314 \n315 \nThe most important message of our study is that more attention needs to be paid to \nunderstanding the local patterns of population decline across sites, and to integrating this \ninformation into analyses at the species level.  This follows from our finding that species \nextinction is not a unitary or homogeneous phenomenon, even within a specific anthropogenic \nprocess.  Such an approach will substantially enhance the applied value of comparative studies \nof extinction risk in at least two ways.  In the short term, it will help us to identify more \naccurately both priority species (in this case, those primate taxa that are slow-reproducers, with \nhigh ecological requirements, low ecological flexibility, and small body size) and priority sites \n(in this case, the most valuable sites will be those where long recovery periods have elapsed \nsince the last logging disturbance).  In the long term, by bridging the gap between local site-\nlevel processes and global species-level patterns, we will be able to develop a more powerful \nscience to guide and underpin effective conservation action. \n \n \n \n 13\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 316 \n317 \n318 \n319 \n320 \n321 \nThe authors thank Peter Bennett, Marcel Cardillo, Kate Jones, Georgina Mace, Stuart Pimm, \nand the anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments.

Parameter \nestimates, standard errors, and associated  Wald Chi-square values for the fixed effects of the \nminimum adequate model of primate population response ratios are given.   \n \n____________________________________________________________________________ \n \nParameter   estimate se  \u03c72  df P \n____________________________________________________________________________ \n \nIntercept    2.58  1.13  5.24  1 <0.05 \nRecovery time    0.09  0.03  7.74  1 <0.01 \nBody mass    0.16  0.06  6.47  1 <0.02 \nGestation period  -0.50  0.22  5.34  1 <0.05 \nEcological flexibility   0.07  0.03  6.52  1 <0.02 \nHome range   -0.08  0.04  4.70  1 <0.05 \n____________________________________________________________________________ \n \n 21\nFigure 1. 482 \n483   \n0\n1\n2\n3\nGo\nrup\ni (B\nR)\nLo\nwe\nr R\nio \nJap\nura\n (B\nR)\nPo\nnta\n da\n Ca\nsta\nnh\na (\nBR\n)\nRe\nma\nnsi\nnh\no (\nBR\n)\nTa\npa\njos\n (B\nR)\nSa\nnta\n Ro\nsa \n(C\nR)\nLo\npe\n (G\nB)\nBi\na (\nGH\n)\nMo\nron\nda\nva\n (M\nA)\nBu\ndo\nng\no (\nUG\n)\nKi\nba\nle \n(U\nG)\nEa\nst K\nali\nma\nnta\nn (\nID\n)\nSu\nma\ntra\nn l\now\nlan\nd f\nore\nst (\nID\n)\nBo\nle \nKe\ncil\n (M\nY)\nKu\nala\n Ro\nmp\nin \n(M\nY)\nLe\nson\ng (\nMY\n)\nPa\nsoh\n (M\nY)\nSil\nab\nuk\nan\n (M\nY)\nSu\nng\nai \nLa\nlan\ng (\nMY\n)\nSu\nng\nai \nSe\nlai\n (M\nY)\nSu\nng\nai \nTe\nka\nm \n(M\nY)\nUl\nu S\neb\nol \n(M\nY)\nUl\nu S\neg\nam\na (\nMY\n)\nre\nsp\non\nse\n ra\ntio\n (s\nqr\nt)\nsite\n(a)\nre\nsp\non\nse\n ra\ntio\n (s\nqr\nt)\n0\n1\n2\n3\nAlo\nua\ntta\n be\nlze\nbu\nl\nAlo\nua\ntta\n pa\nllia\nta\nAte\nles\n ge\noff\nroy\ni\nCe\nbu\ns a\npel\nla\nCe\nbu\ns c\nap\nuci\nnu\ns\nCe\nrco\nceb\nus \nalb\nige\nna\nCe\nrco\npit\nhec\nus \nasc\nan\nius\nCe\nrco\npit\nhec\nus \ncep\nhu\ns\nCe\nrco\npit\nhec\nus \nlho\nest\ni\nCe\nrco\npit\nhec\nus \nmi\ntis\nCe\nrco\npit\nhec\nus \nnic\ntita\nns\nCe\nrco\npit\nhec\nus \npo\ngo\nnia\ns\nCh\neir\nog\nale\nus \nme\ndiu\ns\nCh\niro\npo\ntes\n sa\ntan\nas\nCo\nlob\nus \nba\ndiu\ns\nCo\nlob\nus \ngu\nere\nza\nCo\nlob\nus \nsat\nan\nas\nGo\nril\nla \ngo\nril\nla\nHy\nlob\nate\ns la\nr\nHy\nlob\nate\ns m\nuel\nler\ni\nLe\npil\nem\nur \nmu\nste\nlin\nus\nMa\ncac\na f\nasc\nicu\nlar\nis\nMa\ncac\na n\nem\nest\nrin\na\nMa\nnd\nrill\nus \nsph\ninx\nNy\ncti\nceb\nus \nco\nuca\nng\nPa\nn t\nrog\nlod\nyte\ns\nPe\ntte\nrus\n fu\nlvu\ns\nPh\nan\ner \nfur\ncif\ner\nPo\nng\no p\nyg\nma\neus\nPr\nesb\nyti\ns c\nom\nata\nPr\nesb\nyti\ns m\nela\nlop\nho\ns\nPr\nesb\nyti\ns o\nbsc\nura\nPr\nesb\nyti\ns r\nub\nicu\nnd\na\nPr\nop\nith\necu\ns v\nerr\neau\nxi\nSa\ngu\ninu\ns m\nida\ns\nre\nsp\non\nse\n ra\ntio\n (s\nqr\nt)\nspecies\n(b)\nre\nsp\non\nse\n ra\ntio\n (s\nqr\nt)\n 22\n 23\n484 \n485 \n486 \n487 \n488 \n489 \n490 \n491 \n492 \n493 \n494 \n495 \n496 \n497 \n498 \n499 \n500 \n501 \n502 \n503 \n504 \n505 \n506 \n507 \n508 \n509 \n510 \n511 \nFigure 2. \n \n \n \n \n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n0 15 30 45 60\nTime since logging (years)\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n0 20 40 60 80\nre\nsp\non\nse\n ra\ntio\nBody size (kg)\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n5 15 25 35 45\nGestation period (weeks)\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n3 6 9 12\n \n \n \n \n15\nEcological flexibility (oC)\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n0 10 20 30 40 5\nHome range (km2)\nExtrinsic\nfactors\nIntrinsic\nfactors\n0\nre\nsp\non\nse\n ra\ntio\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"}
