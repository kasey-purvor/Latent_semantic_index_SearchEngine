The earliest work of can be traced back to the 1960s, notably \npioneered by Guthrie (1961), followed by Gerakis (1965) and Gray (1966). The last \nfour decades have seen great developments in tourism demand analysis, in terms of \nthe diversity of research interests, the depth of theoretical foundations, and advances \nin research methodologies. Modeling tourism demand in order to analyze the effects \nof various determinants, and accurate forecasting of future tourism demand, are two \nmajor focuses of tourism demand studies. The developments in tourism forecasting \nmethodologies fall into several streams, amongst which the econometric approach \nplays a very important role in tourism demand studies. This methodology is able to \ninterpret the causes of variations of tourism demand, support policy evaluation and \nstrategy making, and predict future trends in tourism development.   \nSince the beginning of the 1960s a large number of empirical studies on tourism \ndemand have been published. Crouch (1994c) carried out an extensive literature \nsearch and found over 300 publications during the period 1961-1993. Since then about \n120 papers on tourism demand modeling and\/or forecasting have been added to the \ntourism demand literature. A comprehensive overview of the existing empirical work \nwill \u201cprovide guidance to other researchers interested in undertaking other similar \nstudies\u201d (Crouch 1994c, p. 12). A number of review papers have been published.  \n                                                 \n*\n Corresponding author.   \n 2 \nCrouch (1994a, 1994b, 1994c, 1994d, 1995, 1996) examined about 80 econometric \nstudies of international tourism demand covering the period 1961-1993. Using meta-\nanalysis techniques, Crouch (1994a, 1994b, 1995, 1996) identified various inter-study \ndifferences that explained the variations in the findings, principally with respect to \ndemand elasticities. Lim (1997a, 1997b, 1999) reviewed 100 papers on tourism \ndemand modeling published during the period 1961-1994. Lim (1997a, 1997b) \ndiscussed the choice of dependent and explanatory variables, as well as the functional \nspecifications and data used.  Following these papers, Lim (1999) further selected 70 \nstudies for meta-analysis. By calculating effect sizes, Lim (1999) attempted to \ngeneralise the relationships between international tourism demand and income, \ntransportation cost and tourism prices. Unlike the abovementioned review studies, \nSheldon and Var (1985), Uysal and Crompton (1985), and Witt and Witt (1995) \nfocused on tourism demand forecasting practice. In their review, Sheldon and Var \n(1985) considered only 11 studies, all but one being published before 1978. Uysal and \nCrompton (1985) provided an overview of various forecasting approaches applied to \ntourism studies, but no insight into individual studies was provided. Witt and Witt \n(1995) reviewed 40 empirical studies published over 3 decades but all prior to 1992.  \nThe continuing growth of world-wide tourism demand in the 1990s stimulated \nstronger interest in studies in this field, particularly using the econometric approach. \nIn Crouch\u2019s studies, 5, 33 and 42 papers were identified in the 1960s, 1970s and \n1980s, respectively. Lim collected 4, 26, and 50 studies in the same time spans for her \nreview. Since the start of the 1990s, over 80 pieces of empirical research have been \nfound regarding econometric modeling and forecasting of tourism demand. However, \nvery few of the latter studies have been included in the previous review. In their \nreviews, Lim only included 20 papers published during this period, Crouch 5 papers, \nand Witt and Witt 3 papers. All of these papers were published between 1990 and \n1994, and no later publications have been reviewed. This study, therefore, aims to \nprovide an up-to-date comprehensive review of recent studies on tourism demand \nmodeling and forecasting.  \nIt should be noted that meta-analysis is a useful methodology for reviewing \nliterature, \u201cwhich allows statistical generalizations to be made with respect to the \ncombined evidence across studies\u201d (Lim 1999, p. 273). A primary analysis shows that \nmost of the general conclusions drawn by Crouch (1994a, 1994b, 1995, 1996) and \nLim (1999) regarding inter-study differences (e.g. model specification, sample period \nand origin-destination pair concerned) accounting for the variation in demand \nelasticities still hold in the studies currently reviewed. Therefore, this study will not \nrepeat these tests. Nevertheless, with a particular focus on the post-1990 publications \non econometric modeling and forecasting of tourism demand, this paper will identify \nrecent developments of tourism demand studies in terms of modeling techniques and \ntheir forecasting performance. In addition, for the first time, some findings from \nstudies using the Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) models are covered in this \nreview. \nDATA DESCRIPTION \nThere are 81 empirical studies on econometric modeling and forecasting of tourism \ndemand published during 1990-2004 that have been collected for review, \nsupplemented by 3 publications from the 1980s focusing on a particular AIDS model. \nThe literature search includes a computer search of databases of electronic literature \n 3 \nand a manual search for references cited in the literature including book chapters and \nconference papers. The selected papers cover a wide range of journals in tourism, \neconomics and forecasting. Annuals of Tourism Research, Journal of Travel Research, \nTourism Management, Tourism Economics, Applied Economics, and the International \nJournal of Forecasting appear to be most frequently selected for publication of \ntourism demand modeling and forecasting studies. 23 studies not only model tourism \ndemand and examined various influencing factors, but also compare the forecasting \nperformance of alternative econometric models, with some time-series models as \nbenchmarks. Therefore, 84 studies enter the review of tourism demand modeling and \n31 of them are to be further considered for the evaluation of econometric models\u2019 \nforecasting performance.  \n \nECONOMETRIC MODELING OF TOURISM DEMAND \nA detailed summary of the 84 studies under review is shown in Table 1. In \ncomparison with the earlier studies reviewed by Crouch (1994d) and Lim (1997a), \nsome differences, as either emerging or vanishing trends, are identified.  \nData Types and Periods \nThe data used in the reviewed studies covers the period 1960-2001. As with \nprevious studies, three data frequencies were used in the post 1990 studies: annual, \nquarterly and monthly data. Although annual data still dominated the research in this \nperiod, quarterly data have been used more often, in line with the increasing interest \nin analysing the seasonality of international tourism demand. The spans of sample \nperiods were 25 years, 76 quarters and 165 months on average when annual, quarterly \nand monthly data are concerned, respectively. Overall, they were longer than the \naverage period of those reviewed by Crouch (1994d), which was only 14 years. The \nincreasing number of observations results in more degrees of freedom in model \nestimation and gives more flexibility to consider additional influencing factors and\/or \nextend the lag structure to capture the dynamics of tourism demand more sufficiently. \nMeanwhile, some advanced econometric models, which require estimation of more \nparameters such as the time-varying-parameter (TVP) model, are able to be \nintroduced into tourism demand studies. \nOrigin\/Destination  \nWestern European and North American countries dominated tourism research \nstudies prior to 1990. This trend was related to their great contribution to international \ntourism development, as both inbound and outbound tourism in theses areas \naccounted for a very large proportion of global tourism flows. These areas have \ncontinued to draw a great deal of researchers\u2019 attention in the last decade. Among the \n84 studies being reviewed, 59 and 50 referred to UK and US tourism, respectively, \neither as a tourist destination or origin country. Germany, France Spain and Italy also \nreceived considerable attention. Meanwhile, international tourism in the East Asia and \nPacific region has shown the fastest growth in the last decade. Correspondingly, this \nregion attracted more and more research interest. In particular, 30 studies are related \nto Japanese outbound tourism, 23 are related to Australian tourism (mainly inbound), \nand 8 are related to Hong Kong and Korea (inbound and outbound). The main travel \nroutes were from the UK and the USA to Mediterranean countries, Australia and \nHong Kong, and from Japan to Australia and Hong Kong. \n 4 \nTABLE 1 \n  SUMMARY OF ECONOMETRIC STUDIES ON TOURISM DEMAND MODELING AND FORECASTING \nLegend: \n1.

of tourism \ndemand have not changed much. Tourist arrivals was still the most common measure \nin the last decade, followed by the tourist expenditure. In particular, tourist \nexpenditure, in the form of either absolute values or budget shares, is required by the \nspecification of demand system models, such as the linear expenditure system (LES) \nand the AIDS.  \nCompared with the tourism literature before 1990, recent studies pay more attention \nto disaggregated tourism markets by travel purpose (for example, Morley 1998; \nTurner et al 1998; Turner and Witt 2001a). Amongst various market segments, leisure \ntourism attracted the most research attention. 12 studies focused on this particular \ntourism market (for example, Ashworth and Johnson 1990; Kulendran and Witt 2003b; \nSong, Romilly, and Liu 2000; Song, Witt, and Li 2003). Different market segments \nare associated with different influencing factors and varying decision-making \nprocesses. Therefore, studies at disaggregated levels give more precise insights into \nthe features of the particular market segments. As a result, more specific and accurate \ninformation can be provided to develop efficient marketing strategies. \nExplanatory Variables  \nConsistent with previous tourism demand studies, income, relative prices, substitute \nprices, travel costs, exchange rates, dummies and deterministic trends were the most \nfrequently considered influencing factors in the reviewed studies. In spite of different \ndefinitions of income and relative prices, both of them were shown to be the most \nsignificant determinants for international tourism demand. Although travel costs had \nbeen considered in over 50% of the studies reviewed by both Crouch and Lim, in \nrecent studies they did not attract as much attention as before, with only 24 studies \nincluding this variable. As precise measurements of travel costs were lacking, \nespecially of the aggregate level, proxies such as airfares between the origin and the \ndestination had to be used. However, only in a few cases did the use of proxies result \nin significant coefficient estimates. Another reason for insignificant effects of travel \ncosts may be related to all inclusive tours where charter flights are often used, and \nhence airfares bear little relation to published scheduled fares. The deterministic trend \nvariable describes a steady change format, which is too restrictive to be realistic and \nmay cause serious multicollinearity problems. With this borne in mind, recent studies \nhave been less keen to include it in model specifications. This variable only appeared \nin 11 reviewed studies. To capture the effects of one-off events, dummy variables \nhave been commonly used. The two oil crises in the 1970s were shown to have the \nmost significant adverse impacts on international tourism demand, followed by the \nGulf War in the early 1990s, and the global economic recession in the mid 1980s. \nOther regional events and origin\/destination-specific affairs have also been taken into \naccount in specific studies.  \n \nIt should be noted that no effort has been made to examine the impact of tourism \nsupply in the tourism demand literature, which means that the problem of \nidentification has been ignored. An implicit assumption of this omission is that the \ntourism sector concerned is assumed to be sufficiently small and the supply elasticity \nis infinite. To draw more robust conclusions with regard to demand elasticity analysis, \nhowever, this condition needs to be carefully examined in future studies.  \n 11 \n \nFunctional Forms \nContinuing the trend of the 1960s-1980s, log-linear regression was still the \npredominant functional form in the context of tourism demand studies in the 1990s. \n53 studies specified log-linear models, 17 linear models, and only 3 non-linear forms. \nIn addition, a semi-log (both linear and non-linear) form appeared in 14 demand \nsystems, principally AIDS models, where only independent variables (prices and real \nexpenditure) were transformed into logarithm. Crouch (1992) concluded that the log-\nlinear form was generally proved to be superior when both linear and log-linear forms \nwere tested. In a recent study, Vanegas and Croes (2000) compared a few linear and \nlog-linear models of US demand for tourism in Aruba and concluded that log-linear \nmodels generally fitted the data better (although only slightly) in terms of the \nstatistical significance of the estimated coefficients, whereas Qiu and Zhang (1995) \nran a similar comparison but did not find a significant difference between the two \nforms.  \nAn advantage of using log-linear regressions is that the log transformation may \nreduce the integration order of the variables from I(2) to I(1), so that the standard \ncointegration (CI) analysis is allowed. However, the elasticities derived from log-\nlinear regressions (within the traditional fixed-parameter framework) are constant \nover time. This condition is quite restrictive and often leads to the failure of dynamic \nanalysis of tourism demand. Moreover, such a model may not be useful for short-term \nforecasting (Lim 1997b).  However, the problem of constant elasticities can be solved \nby rewriting the regression in the state space form (SSF) and estimating it by the \nKalman filter algorithm. Such a method is termed the TVP model, and it will be \nintroduced in the following section.  \nModel Specification and Estimation \nCI Model and Error Correction Model (ECM). In the early 1990s, econometric \nmodeling and forecasting of tourism demand was still restricted to static models, \nwhich suffer from quite a few problems such as spurious regression (Song and Witt, \n2000). Since the mid 1990s, dynamic models, for example, a number of specific forms \nof the autoregressive distributed lag models (ADLMs), (Hendry 1995, p. 232) \nincluding ECMs have appeared in the tourism demand literature. The potentially \nspurious regression problem can be readily overcome by using the CI\/ECM analysis. \nWhen the CI relationship is identified, the CI equation can be transformed into an \nECM (and vice versa), in which both the long-run equilibrium relationship and short-\nrun dynamics are traced. An additional advantage of using the ECM is that the \nregressors in an ECM are almost orthogonal and this avoids the occurrence of \nmulticollinearity, which may otherwise be a serious problem in econometric analysis \n(Syriopoulos, 1995). However, it should be noted the CI relationship does not \nnecessarily hold in every case of tourism demand. The application of this \nmethodology should be subject to strict statistical tests.   \n17 of the studies under review applied the CI\/ECM technique to international \ntourism demand analysis. Four CI\/ECM estimation methods have been used - the \nEngle-Granger (1987) two-stage approach (EG), the Wickens-Breusch (1988) one-\nstage approach (WB), the ADLM approach (Pesaran and Shin, 1995), and the most \nfrequently employed Johansen (1988) maximum likelihood (JML) approach. Due to \n 12 \ndifferent modeling strategies, these models may yield demand elasticities with large \ndiscrepancies for the same data set. Moreover, unlike the other methods, the JML \napproach may detect more than one CI relationship amongst the demand and \nexplanatory variables. The determination of the unique CI relationships in the JML \nframework involves testing for identification. It is important to impose appropriate \nidentifying restrictions, which should have an explicit underpinning of economic \ntheories (Harris and Sollis 2003). All of these approaches have their merits, and there \nhas not been clear-cut evidence to show that any one is superior to the others. \nSometimes the evaluation is associated with their ex post forecasting performance. \nTime Varying Parameter (TVP) Model. To overcome the unrealistic assumption of \nconstant coefficients (or elasticities in log-linear regression) associated with the \ntraditional econometric techniques, the TVP model was developed and has been \napplied in tourism demand studies.  The TVP model is specified in the following SSF: \ntttt xy \u03b5\u03b1 +=      (1) \nttttt RT \u03b7\u03b1\u03b1 +=+1       (2) \nwhere ty  is a vector of tourism demand, tx  is an matrix of explanatory variables, t\u03b1  \nis an unobserved vector of parameters known as the state vector, tT  and tR  are \ntransition matrices, and t\u03b5  and t\u03b7  are vectors of Gaussian disturbances which are \nserially independent and independent of each other at all time points. The TVP model \ncan be estimated using the Kalman filter algorithm. The TVP model first appeared in \nthe tourism literature in 1999 and only 6 applications have been identified. They were \nall related to annual tourism data and the main focus of these studies was the \nevolution of demand elasticities over a relatively long period. Taking sufficient \naccount of the dynamics of tourist behaviors, the TVP model is likely to generate \nmore accurate forecasts of tourism demand. This will be discussed in a later section.  \nVector Autoregressive (VAR) Approach. Most of the traditional tourism demand \nmodels are specified in a single-equation form, which implicitly assumes that the \nexplanatory variables are exogenous. If the assumption is invalid, the estimated \nparameters are likely to be biased and inconsistent. Where exogeneity is not assured, \nthe vector autoregressive (VAR) model is more appropriate. The VAR model is a \nsystem of equations in which all variables are treated as endogenous. It can be written \nas: \n\u2211\n=\n\u2212 ++=\np\ni\nttitit UBZYAY\n1\n              (3) \nwhere tY  is a k vector of endogenous variables, tZ  is a d vector of exogenous \nvariables, Ai and B are matrices of coefficients to be estimated, and tU  is a vector of \ninnovations that is independently and identically distributed. The JML CI\/ECM \nanalysis is based on the unrestricted VAR method. Since 1998, there have been 8 \nstudies utilizing the VAR approach including the cointegrated VAR and VECM for \ntourism demand analysis.  \nAlmost Ideal Demand Systems (AIDS). Another limitation of the single-equation \nanalysis of tourism demand is that this approach is incapable of analyzing the \ninterdependence of budget allocations to different tourist products\/destinations. \n 13 \nLacking a strong underpinning of economic theory, the single-equation approach is \nrelatively ad hoc. As a result, it is hard to attach a strong degree of confidence to the \nresults (especially regarding demand elasticities) derived from this methodology. On \nthe contrary, the demand system approach, which embodies the principles of demand \ntheory, is more appropriate for tourism demand analysis. Amongst a number of \nsystem approaches available, the AIDS introduced by Deaton and Muellbauer (1980) \nhas been the most commonly used method because of its considerable advantages \nover others. The AIDS model is specified in the form: \n i\nj\nijijii uPxbpw +++= \u2211 )\/log(log\u03b3\u03b1    (4) \nwhere wi is the budget share of the ith good, pi is the price of the ith good, x is total \nexpenditure on all goods in the system, P is the aggregate price index for the system, \nand ui is the disturbance term. The aggregate price index P is defined as: \n\u2211 \u2211\u2211++=\ni i j\njiijii pppaP loglog\n2\n1\nloglog 0 \u03b3\u03b1                      (5) \nwhere 0a and i\u03b1 are parameters that to be estimated. Replacing P with the following \nStone\u2019s (1954) price index (P*), the linearly approximated AIDS is derived and \ntermed \u201cLAIDS\u201d.  \n\u2211=\ni\nii pwP log*log       (6) \nThe AIDS\/LAIDS can be used to test the properties of homogeneity and symmetry \nassociated with demand theory. Moreover, both uncompensated and compensated \ndemand elasticities including expenditure, own-price and cross-price elasticities can \nbe calculated. They have a stronger theoretical basis than the single-equation \napproach.  \nThe LAIDS model can be estimated by three methods: ordinary least squares (OLS), \nmaximum likelihood (ML) and Zellner\u2019s (1962) iterative approach for seemingly \nunrelated regression (SUR) estimation. The SUR method is used most often, as it \nperforms more efficiently than OLS in the system with the symmetry restriction \n(Syriopoulos 1995). It will also converge to the ML estimator, provided that the \nresiduals are distributed normally (Rickertsen 1998). \nSince the AIDS model was introduced into tourism demand studies in the 1980s, it \nhas not attracted much attention until recently. 12 applications have been identified \nincluding 3 in the 1980s, 1 in 1993 and 8 after 1999. Most of these studies analyzed \nallocations of tourists\u2019 expenditure in a group of destination countries, while Fujii et \nal (1985) investigated tourists\u2019 expenditure on different consumer goods in a \nparticular destination. Where a group of destinations are concerned, substitutability \nand complementarity between them are investigated by calculating cross-price \nelasticities. The AIDS\/LAIDS has been developed from the original static form to the \nerror correction form. Combing the ECM with the LAIDS, Durbarry and Sinclair \n(2003), Li, Song, and Witt (2004), and Mangion, Durbarry, and Sinclair (2003) \nspecified EC-LAIDS models to examine the dynamics of tourists\u2019 consumption \nbehavior. \n 14 \nOther demand system models such as the LES by Pyo, Uysal, and McLellan  (1991) \nand the translog utility function by Bakkal (1991) have also appeared in the tourism \ncontext, but compared to AIDS\/LAIDS their applications were extremely rare.  \nTime Series Models Augmented with Explanatory Variables. Another emerging \ntrend of tourism demand research has been the introduction of the advanced time-\nseries techniques into the causal regression framework. By doing so, the advantages \nof both methodologies are combined. Two notable examples are the structural time \nseries model with explanatory variables (STSM) which expands the basic structural \nmodel without explanatory variables (BSM), and the AR(I)MAX model based on the \nAR(I)MA technique. The BSM and the AR(I)MA model are advanced time-series \nforecasting techniques and have shown favorable forecasting performance in the \ntourism context. The BSM can readily capture the trends, seasonal patterns and cycles \ninvolved in demand variables. Similar to the technique of the TVP model, the BSM \nand STSM are also written in the SSF and estimated by the Kalman filter. They are \nvery useful as far as seasonal data are concerned. The AR(I)MA model includes both \nautoregressive filters and moving average filters to account for systematic effects and \nshock effects in the endogenous variable itself, respectively. With explanatory \nvariables being added into the model specifications, the STSM and the AR(I)MAX \nmodel are more powerful in interpreting variations in demand variables relative to the \nBSM and the AR(I)MA model, respectively. Meanwhile, they embody the dynamics \nof the demand variables and overcome the problem of autocorrelation suffered by \nconventional static regressions. Amongst the 84 econometric studies, there are 6 \napplications of the STSM and 3 of the AR(I)MAX model. Another advantage of using \nthese models is the potential to generate accurate tourism forecasts, which will be \ninvestigated in a later section.  \nData frequency affects the specification of the models. For example, the STSM and \nAR(I)MAX models have been used more often when  monthly or quarterly data are \nconcerned. Annual data, however, have always been used in the estimation of the \nAIDS\/LAIDS models. Annual data, however, have always been used in the estimation \nof AIDS\/LAIDS models. The main reason for this is that these latter models aim to \nexamine long-run demand elasticities. In most cases, the TVP model has been applied \nto annual data, although it is possible to incorporate seasonality into the specification. \nThe combination of the TVP model with the STSM is of interest for future tourism \ndemand studies. Depending on the integration order of the data, the ECM and VAR \nmodels can readily accommodate data with different frequencies (Song and Witt \n2000). \nDiagnostic Tests \nWitt and Witt (1995) pointed out the problems in tourism demand models prior to \nthe early 1990s, one of which is the lack of diagnostic checking. As a result, the \ninferences from the estimated models might be highly sensitive to the statistical \nassumptions, especially when a small number of observations are available (Lim \n1997a). The situation has changed since the mid 1990s. In addition to the \nconventional statistics reported in earlier studies such as goodness of fit, F statistic \nand Durbin-Watson autocorrelation statistic, many recent studies have carried out \ntests for unit roots, higher-order autocorrelation, heteroscedasticity, non-normality, \nmis-specification, structural break and forecasting failure. In particular, Dristakis \n(2003), Kim and Song (1998), and Song, Romilly, and Liu (2000) each reported about \n 15 \n10 diagnostic tests for their estimates. Amongst various diagnostic tests, unit root tests \nfor annual data or seasonal unit root tests for monthly or quarterly data have been \nwidely used where CI\/ECM approaches were considered. Most of the models reported \nin the studies after 1995 passed the majority of these tests. The enhanced model \nperformance is likely to generate more accurate forecasts and more meaningful \nimplications for the practical operations of tourism industries and government \nagencies. \nDemand Elasticities \nTourism demand elasticities have been discussed comprehensively by Crouch \n(1992, 1994a, 994b, 1995, 1996). Consistent with his findings, recent studies have \nalso shown that the income elasticity is generally greater than one, indicating that \ninternational tourism, especially long-haul travel, is a luxury. The own-price elasticity \nis normally negative, although the magnitudes vary considerably. The reasons that \ncause the discrepancies in demand elasticities have been identified in Crouch\u2019s work, \ntherefore this paper will only address some additional issues.  \nLong-Run and Short-Run Elasticities. In addition to the findings in line with \nprevious studies, some new light has been shed on the literature by the research \nadopting the CI\/ECM techniques. Given the CI relationship being assured by \nstatistical tests, long-run and short-run tourism demand elasticities can be calculated \nfrom the CI equation and the ECM, respectively. With regard to the income elasticity, \nlower degrees of significance in ECMs than those in the CI models indicate that \nincome affects tourism demand more in the long run than in the short run. To some \nextent, it indicates that Friedman\u2019s (1957) permanent income hypothesis holds. In \nother words, consumption depends on what people expect to earn over a considerable \nperiod of time, and fluctuations in income regarded as temporary have little effect on \ntheir consumption spending. Many empirical studies also show that the values of both \nthe income and own-price elasticities in the long run are greater than their short-run \ncounterparts, suggesting that tourists are more sensitive to income\/price changes in \nthe long run than in the short run. These findings are in line with demand theory. Due \nto information asymmetry and relatively inflexible budget allocations, it takes time \nbefore income changes affect tourism demand (Syriopoulos 1995).  \nCross-Price Elasticities. The cross-price elasticity contributes to the analysis of the \ninterrelationships between alternative destinations. As mentioned earlier, this is one of \nthe advantages of the AIDS model over single-equation regressions. Seven studies \nused this approach to study UK outbound tourism demand. Table 2 summarizes the \nsubstitution and complementarity relationships between alternative destinations \nconsidered by UK tourists. Due to the differences with respect to the composition of \nthe demand systems, the data periods, the definitions of variables and estimation \nmethods, some contradictions between the findings are identified. However, some \nfindings are supported across studies. For example, a significant substitution effect \nbetween France and Spain was commonly found (see De Mello, Park and Sinclair \n2002, Li, Song, and Witt 2004, Lyssiotou 2001), and Greece and Italy were generally \nregarded as complementary destinations by UK tourists (see Li, Song, and Witt 2004, \nLyssiotou 2001, Papatheodorou 1999, Syriopoulos and Sinclair 1993). Moreover, \nItaly and Turkey were substitutes for each other to some extent (see Papatheodorou \n1999, Syriopoulos and Sinclair 1993). These findings have important policy \nimplications for the destination concerned. A significant substitution effect indicates \n 16 \nstrong competitors, and different degrees of substitution (suggested by the values of \nthe elasticities ab\u03b5  and ba\u03b5 ) between the competing destinations a and b show their \ncompetitive positions in the tourism markets. Therefore, the implication could be to \nadopt appropriate strategies based on the specific attributes the destinations possess or \nto focus on differentiated markets segments, i.e., to make full use of their competitive \nadvantages. Where complementary effects are in place, the destinations involved may \nconsider launching joint marketing programs to maximize their total profits. \nEvolution of Eelasticities. Compared to the long-run constant demand elasticities, \nanalyzing the evolution of demand elasticities over time has great importance for \nshort-term forecasting.  Crouch (1994b, 1996) has identified the differences regarding \nincome and own-price elasticities in different time periods. Using the TVP approach, \nLi, Song, and Witt (2002), Song and Witt (2000), and Song and Wong (2003) \nconfirmed the above findings in their empirical studies. In particular, the significant \nimpacts of the two oil crises in the 1970s and the economic recession in the 1980s on \ntourism demand, in terms of the income elasticities, were readily accommodated in \ntheir models. It suggests that the TVP model is preferable to the log-linear fixed-\nparameter regressions when investigating the dynamics of tourism demand. \nPERFORMANCE OF FORECASTING MODELS \nAmong the 84 studies being reviewed, 23 papers exercised the compared \nforecasting performance amongst different econometric models or amongst \neconometric, univariate time-series and other (e.g. neural network) models. Apart \nfrom Rossello-Nadal (2001) who investigated forecasting models\u2019 turning point \naccuracy, all the other papers examined forecast error magnitudes. Therefore, the \nreview of forecasting models\u2019 performance will focus on error magnitude accuracy. In \naddition to error magnitudes, Witt, Song, and Louvieris (2003) also observed \ndirectional changes of demand forecasts, and Witt and Witt (1991) and its extended \nversion Witt and Witt (1992) included directional changes and trend changes in their \nforecasting accuracy evaluations. Due to extremely small numbers of applications, \nthese two measures of forecasting accuracy are ignored in this review. The ranks of \ncompared models in each of the 22 studies\n1\n, in terms of forecast accuracy, are \ntabulated for detailed analysis (Table 3). Since error magnitude accuracy dominates \nthe evaluation of tourism demand forecasting, the following discussion will mainly \nfocus on this measure.  \nTable 3 summarizes the rankings of forecasting models measured by the MAPE \nexcept for 4 studies in which only the MAE or RMSE was available. Due to space \nlimitations, the results of other measures are omitted from this table. The rankings of \ncompeting models at each forecasting horizon and the overall ranks are presented in \nTable 3. Where they were not reported directly in the original papers, the aggregation \nof MAPEs is calculated based on the individual MAPEs originally reported. \n                                                 \n1\n Li, Song, and Witt (2004) is excluded from Table 2 due to different models considered in the \ncomparison. \n 17 \nTABLE 2 \n INTERRELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ALTERNATIVE DESTINATIONS WITH REGARD TO UK TOURISTS \n France Cyprus Greece Italy Malta Portugal Spain Turkey Yugoslavia Australia New Zealand Canada US \nFrance   -D C C\u2019 -D -C C\u2019  A D C -C\u2019 A D C C\u2019     -D -D \nCyprus     E  E       \nGreece -D C C\u2019   -G -F -D  -C -C\u2019  G F -D -C C\u2019 G F -D C -C\u2019 -G F -F   D D \nItaly -D -C C\u2019  -G -D -F -C -C\u2019   -G F -D C C\u2019 G F -D -C C\u2019 F G -F   D D \nMalta  -E     E       \nPortugal A C C\u2019 D  G -C C\u2019  -D F F -G C C\u2019-D  -C G F A -C -C\u2019 -D -G F -F   D D \nSpain A C C\u2019 D E F G C -C\u2019 -D F G -C C\u2019 -D E G A -C -C\u2019 -D F  -G F F   D D \nTurkey   F -G F G  F -G F -G  -F     \nYugoslavia   -F -F  -F  -F      \nAustralia           B  B \nNew Zealand          B   B \nCanada -D  D D  D D      -D \nUS -D  D D  D D   B B -D  \nNotes: 1.

descriptive \nstatistics. In the forecasting performance comparison, the na\u00efve 1 model, which is also \nknown as \u201cno change\u201d model, is often used as a benchmark. Various ECMs, \nespecially the JML-ECM, are most often considered in the econometric forecasting of \ntourism demand. The static regression model also frequently appeared in the \ncomparison as either a benchmark for econometric models or a competitor for time-\nseries models. Within the time-series forecasting scope, AR(I)MA models, including \nthe seasonal version SAR(I)MA, has been the most popular.  \nThe frequency with which each model appeared in the top two positions across all \nforecasting horizons suggests that the TVP model and the STSM, based on the same \nmodeling technique, both performed relatively well in general. In particular, the TVP \nmodel was ranked number one in 7 and number two in 4 out of 15 cases. These \nfindings are confirmed by the calculated means of overall ranks in all studies. On the \nother hand, the standard deviation of the overall ranks shows that the VAR model \nperformed the least consistently, and its ranks varied from the top to the bottom. It \nshould be noted that, due to the small number of studies being reviewed, some caution \nshould be given to the interpretation of the means and standard deviations of the \noverall ranks.  \nFactors Influencing Relative Forecasting Performance \nTables 3 and 4 show that there is no one forecasting model that outperforms the \nothers in all situations. Various factors are attributed to the discrepancies in \nperformance between the studies.  \nMeasures of Forecasting Error Magnitudes. Different measures for forecasting error \nmagnitudes have been available for tourism demand forecasting evaluations. The \npredominant measure was MAPE, commonly used in all studies with only 4 \nexceptions and 144 out of 180 individual comparisons (from original papers). It was \nfollowed by RMSE and RMSPE, and they were used in 97 and 86 comparisons, \nrespectively. In very few studies, other evaluation measures were applied, such as \nMAE and Theil\u2019s U statistic, acceptable output percentage (Z) and normalized \ncorrelation coefficient (r). Comparing different measures of the relative forecasting \nperformance of the estimated models, the MAPE and RMSE (or RMSPE) gave the \nsame rankings in only 32 out of 117 cases. The discrepancy was evident especially \nwhen large variations appeared among individual forecast errors. The inconsistency \nbetween the rankings given by two groups of measures is due to different assumptions \nregarding the forms of the loss functions. The MAPE is associated with a linear loss \nfunction, while the RMSE and RMSPE are consistent with the notion of a quadratic \nform (Theil 1966). As a result, the RMSE and RMSPE are more sensitive to one \nextremely bad forecast.  \nIt should be noted that the above measures such as MAPE and RMSPE do not have \na statistical underpinning. To examine if the difference in the accuracy of competing \nforecasts is significant, formal statistical tests need to be performed. So far, only Witt, \nSong, and Louvieris (2003) have examined forecasting bias and directional change \nforecasting performance using formal statistics in a tourism context. Such formal tests \nshould be given more attention in forecasting performance comparisons. \n 22 \nTime-Horizons of Forecasting. The forecasting power varies across different \nforecasting horizons. In general, due to increasing uncertainty, the longer the \nforecasting horizon, the less accurate the predictions. The frequency that each model \nwas ranked in the top two at each forecasting horizon (Table 4) suggests that the TVP \nmodel and the STSM outperformed their competitors especially as far as short-run \n(one-step-ahead) forecasting was concerned. Witt, Song, and Louvieris (2003) also \nshowed that the TVP model provided sound performance in one-step-ahead \ndirectional change forecasts. Frequencies displayed in Table 4 also show that the \nJML-ECM forecast more accurately in the medium to long run (5-10-steps ahead) \nthan in the short run. So far the ADLM-ECM and the WB-ECM have not shown \nsatisfactory performance in spite of considering different forecasting horizons. \nHowever, due to extremely few applications of these models, general conclusions \ncannot be drawn, unless more tests of their forecasting abilities are undertaken in the \nfuture research. It should be noted that, due to the rationale and model specification, \nthe ECMs are likely to perform better where the differenced demand variable (or the \ngrowth rate in the log-transform model) is concerned. However, no published study \nhas conducted this empirical test yet.  \nData Frequency. Annual data were used most frequently in the above forecasting \nexercises (by 13 studies), followed by quarterly data (7 studies) and monthly data \n(only 2 studies). Monthly and quarterly data possess different properties compared \nwith annual data, because tourism demand exhibits strong seasonality. Therefore, the \nmodels that readily account for seasonal variations, such as the SAR(I)MA model and \nthe STSM, are preferable where these types of data are used. They generally \nperformed well, except in Kulendran and Witt (2003a). Most of the other econometric \nmodels were most often related to annual data except the JML-ECM, which was used \noften for both annual and quarterly data and performed slightly better where quarterly \ndata were utilized. In the future it will be worth testing the forecasting abilities of \nother advanced econometric models in dealing with seasonality in tourism demand. In \nparticular, since the STSM and the TVP model both have shown their superior \nperformance when seasonal and annual data were concerned, respectively, the \ncombination of these two models and the application to seasonal data is likely to be \nadvantageous.  \nForecasting Competitors. The relative forecasting performance, in terms of the rank \nof an evaluated model, to a certain extent depends on which competitors take part in \nthe comparison. For example, in the comparisons where the static regression model \nwas the only causal model (Law 2000; Law and Au 1999; Witt and Witt 1991 and \n1992), it was always outperformed by time series models. In particular, all the results \nof the one-year-ahead forecasting of Witt and Witt (1992) showed that the naive 1 \nmodel was superior to all the other non-causal and causal candidates. However, in the \nforecasting comparisons involving more advanced causal models, non-causal models \ndid not show outstanding performance, especially when annual data were used. The \nlatter outperformed causal models and were ranked top in only 6 out of 16 studies in \nterms of the overall ranking, 4 being associated with quarterly data. In particular, the \nnaive 1 model generated the best forecasts only in 3 out of 12 overall evaluations and \n6 out of 32 comparisons at individual forecast horizons. These results suggest that \napplying advanced econometric techniques to tourism demand forecasting should be \nencouraged, especially in the cases where annual data are to be used. \nData Generation Processes (DGPs). Within a single study where the same models \nare applied for different origin-destination pairs, their performance may vary from \n 23 \ncase to case. An extreme example can be seen in the results of Li, Song, and Witt \n(2002), where the ARIMA model was shown to generate the most accurate forecasts \nin the cases of Japan and Singapore, while the second poorest for Australia and the \nUS. Furthermore, the WB-ECM outperforms all the other candidates in Australia\u2019s \ncase, but is ranked the last second in the UK\u2019s case. Similar phenomena can also be \nseen in Kim and Song (1998), Kulendran and King (1997), Kulendran and Wilson \n(2000) and so on. Such discrepancies in models\u2019 performance across different \ncountries may well result from different DGPs relating to these destinations or origins, \nespecially in the cases where destination- or origin-specific one-off events take place.  \nA model\u2019s ability to capture the intervention effect on the time series may also \naffect predictive accuracy. Within the tourism context, however, the impact of \ninterventions, as well as outlier detection, has only been assessed for timeseries \nmodels (see, for instance, Goh and Law 2002; Chu 2004). No study has examined the \neffects of interventions or outliers on the forecasting performance of econometric \nmodels. \nEmerging Forecasting Models \nThe forecasting performance of the AR(I)MAX model and the error correction \nLAIDS model has been examined in the tourism context recently. Cho (2001) \ncompared the forecasting accuracy of the ARIMAX model with the ARIMA and two \nexponential smoothing models. The results show that the ARIMAX model was \nalways ranked in the top two and first place in 2 out of 6 cases. Akal (2004) found the \nARMA model outperformed the static regression model in his research. However, \nnone of the advanced econometric models entered the competitions in these two \nstudies, and it should be of interest to fill this gap in further studies. The study of Li, \nSong, and Witt (2004) is the only one that compared forecasting accuracy amongst \ndemand system models. Forecasts of tourism demand measured by market shares \nhave particular importance for competitive analysis between competing destinations. \nLi, Song, and Witt (2004) study showed that by incorporating the ECM into the \nLAIDS specification, its short-run (one-year-ahead) forecasting accuracy of market \nshares improved remarkably. However, no longer time horizons have been \nconsidered, and the performance in forecasting market share changes has not been \ninvestigated yet. These indicate possible directions for further studies on tourism \ndemand forecasting. \nSUMMARY \nThe continuing growth of international tourism demand in the last decade has \nstimulated studies in this field. To reflect the latest developments in the research on \neconometric modeling and forecasting of tourism demand, this study provides an up-\nto-date survey of 84 empirical studies in this area, mostly published after 1990. \nCompared to the studies between the 1960s and 1980s, more advanced econometric \ntechniques, such as the CI\/ECM, VAR , TVP and AIDS models have been applied to \ntourism demand studies in the 1990s and early 2000s. These methods contribute to \nimprovements in the understanding of international tourism demand. In particular, the \nCI\/ECM approaches identify the differences between the long-run and short-run \ndemand elasticities, and the TVP model demonstrates the evolution of elasticities over \ntime. A further review of 23 tourism demand forecasting studies suggests that there is \nno single model that outperforms the others in all cases. The performance of \nalternative models is situation-specific, and many factors may influence their \n 24 \nforecasting accuracy. In general, the TVP model and the STSM perform relatively \nwell, especially for short-run forecasting. Where advanced econometric models \ncompete with their univariate time-series counterparts or the conventional benchmark \nno-change model, the econometric models tend to outperform the others, especially as \nfar as annual data are concerned.  \nSome emerging models have shown advantages in modeling and forecasting \ninternational tourism demand. Broader applications and further improvements of these \nmethodologies are likely to benefit research in this area. In particular, the following \ndirections are of interest and value in future econometric studies of tourism demand.  \n1. Further application of the AIDS\/LAIDS especially its ECM form for analyzing \nand predicting market shares and their variations. \n2. Combination of the STSM and TVP model to forecast seasonal tourism \ndemand. \n3. Further employment of the AR(I)MAX model and examination of its \nforecasting performance in comparison with other econometric models.  \n4. Comparison of the abilities of alternative models to forecast tourism demand \nchanges (or growth).   \n5. Investigation of the forecasting performance of advanced econometric models \nin dealing with seasonality in tourism demand.  \nIn view of the diversity of research findings, including those derived from newly \nemerging techniques which has resulted in a relatively small number of observations \nin this survey (especially those related to forecasting comparison), caution should be \nexercised in interpreting the generalized findings of this paper.  \n \nREFERENCES \nAkal, M.
