Introduction\n[2] In this paper we investigate the bulk upflow of low\u2010\nenergy (Ek < 10 eV) thermal ions in the low\u2010altitude\nnorthern cusp. Observational and theoretical research from\nthe 1960s to present\u2010day have established that the iono-\nsphere is a significant source of ions for the magnetosphere\n[Nishida, 1966; Banks and Holzer, 1969; Shelley et al.,\n1972; Hoffman and Dodson, 1980; Shelley et al., 1982;\nHorwitz, 1982; Waite et al., 1985; Lockwood et al., 1985;\nCladis, 1986; Chappell, 1988; Abe et al., 1993] (see, for\nexample, the review by Horwitz and Moore [1997]). At high\naltitudes (>2000 km), the classical polar wind (the high\u2010\nlatitude flow of ionospheric thermal plasma into the mag-\nnetosphere on open geomagnetic field lines) supplies the\nmagnetosphere with primarily H+, He+ and O+ ions, with\nbulk speeds reaching gravitational escape speed [Abe et al.,\n1993] (see also the reviews by Yau and Andre [1997] and\nYau et al. [2007]). Moreover, ion acceleration by plasma\nwaves and parallel electric fields directly gives rise to\nsuprathermal outflowing ions in the form of conics and\nfield\u2010aligned beams, respectively [Sharp et al., 1977;\nGhielmetti et al., 1978; Gorney et al., 1981; Carlson et al.,\n1998; Andr\u00e9 et al., 1998; Bouhram et al., 2002]. Lockwood\net al. [1985], Tsunoda et al. [1989] and others have estab-\nlished what has become known as the \u201cCleft Ion Fountain,\u201d\na narrow\u2010latitude source of heavy ion outflow in the cusp\/\ncleft.\n[3] The high\u2010altitude outflows are regulated in part by the\nsupply of thermal plasma from below, via the magnetic\nfield\u2010aligned motion of the cold, dense F region and topside\nionospheric plasma at midlatitudes and high latitudes (see\nthe review by Moore et al. [1999, and references therein]).\n1Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Calgary,\nCalgary, Alberta, Canada.\n2Space Science Applications Laboratory, Aerospace Corporation, El\nSegundo, California, USA.\n3Department of Arctic Geophysics, University Centre in Svalbard,\nLongyearbyen, Norway.\n4Space Weather Laboratory, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center,\nGreenbelt, Maryland, USA.\n5Institut f\u00fcr Experimentelle und Angewandte Physik, Christian\u2010\nAlbrechts\u2010Universit\u00e4t zu Kiel, Kiel, Germany.\n6Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester,\nLeicester, UK.\nCopyright 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148\u20100227\/10\/2009JA015006\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 115, A05206, doi:10.1029\/2009JA015006, 2010\nA05206 1 of 16\nGround\u2010based radars and orbiting spacecraft have routinely\nobserved low\u2010altitude (<2000 km) thermal ion upflows at\nmidlatitudes and high latitudes reaching speeds of up to\n1 km s\u22121, and occasionally greater [e.g., Tsunoda et al., 1989;\nWahlund and Opgenoorth, 1989; Yeh and Foster, 1990;\nLoranc et al., 1991; Wahlund et al., 1992; Semeter et al.,\n2003; Ogawa et al., 2009]. A number of rocket experi-\nments have reported large upflows at altitudes below 1000 km\n[Bering et al., 1975; Lynch et al., 2007]. Following con-\nvention we use the term upflow to refer to upward bulk\nmotion of ions with speeds less than the escape speed,\nwhereas outflow signifies speeds greater than escape speed.\nIn the literature, upflowing ions are often classified into\nthermal and suprathermal components, and within the\nthermal component the polar wind and auroral bulk upflow\nare the dominant types.\n[4] A number of mechanisms are known to be capable of\ncausing ion upflow. (1) Collisional ~E \u00d7 ~B convection flow\nenergy is dissipated as heat (frictional heating) in the E\nregion, causing a rise in ion temperature and consequently an\nexpansion of the ionosphere [e.g., Loranc and St.\u2010Maurice,\n1994]. (2) Soft electron (<1 keV) precipitation and\/or heat\nconduction increases the temperature of the ionospheric\nelectrons, enhancing the ambipolar electric field which then\naccelerates ions upward [Whitteker, 1977; Liu et al., 1995;\nHorwitz and Moore, 1997]. (3) Anisotropic ion heating by\nplasma waves (broadband extremely low frequency\n(BBELF) waves, for example, generated by convective\nvelocity shear) can lead to upflow via the magnetic mirror\nforce [Ganguli et al., 1994]. (4) Precipitation of heavy ions\nfrom the ring current can drive high\u2010speed midlatitude\nheavy ion upflows [Yeh and Foster, 1990]. (5) Other\nmechanisms have been proposed for generating and sus-\ntaining electric fields in the direction parallel to the geo-\nmagnetic field [e.g., Kagan and St.\u2010Maurice, 2005, and\nreferences therein]. These electric fields can directly drive\nthermal ion upflow. The consequence of all these mechan-\nisms is that they can supply fresh plasma to the source\nregions of high\u2010altitude ion outflow [e.g., Horwitz and\nMoore, 1997].\n[5] There is still some controversy on the role of electron\nprecipitation in driving ion upflow. Moen et al. [2004]\nprovided strong evidence for low\u2010energy particle precipita-\ntion as the principal driver for ion upflow in the low\u2010altitude\ncusp based on coordinated ground\u2010based radar and optical\nmeasurements of poleward moving auroral forms and ion\nupflow. They emphasized the transient nature of the upflow\nand electron precipitation, and argued that both are sig-\nnatures of reconnection. They suggested that all ion outflow\nevents start ultimately in the F region ionosphere. Ogawa\net al. [2000] presented simultaneous radar observations of\nion upflow that were consistent with a combination of elec-\ntron precipitation and the mirror force (via transverse ion\nacceleration fromwaves) as the causes of upflow. Lynch et al.\n[2007] presented SIERRA rocket observations of ion\nupflows up to 2 km s\u22121 in the cusp\/cleft. Using simulations\nfrom the TRANSCAR ionospheric model, they argued that\nthe upflow was driven by soft electron precipitation. On the\nother hand, Frederick\u2010Frost et al. [2007] confirmed the link\nbetween BBELF and ion heating in a region of ion upflow\nin the cusp\/cleft ionosphere from in situ observations on the\nSERSIO sounding rocket between 520 and 780 km. During\na period of ion upflow on the nightside poleward edge of\nthe auroral zone, Semeter et al. [2003] observed no\nenhancement in either electron or ion plasma temperatures,\nand speculated that neither soft electron precipitation nor\nmagnetospheric electron heat flux could explain the upflow.\nUsing observations from the FAST satellite at 4000 km\naltitude, Strangeway et al. [2005] found a higher correlation\nbetween upward ion flux and precipitating electron density\nthan upward ion flux and Poynting flux in the high\u2010latitude,\nhigh\u2010altitude dayside cusp, although they recommended\nusing Poynting flux as an indicator of upflow when particle\nmeasurements are not available. The investigation by Zheng\net al. [2005], using observations from the Polar satellite at\n6000 km altitude, qualitatively corroborated the findings of\nStrangeway et al. [2005], although their scaling laws have\ndifferent powers. Seo et al. [1997] found significant corre-\nlations between ion upflow velocity and the electron and ion\ntemperatures, and suggested that their observations were\nconsistent with an ambipolar electric field driver, although\nthey could not rule out contributions from ion frictional\nheating. S\u00e9ran et al. [2007] presented Demeter observations\nof regions of O+ upflow in the midnight auroral zone during\nthe magnetic storm of 7\u20138 November 2004, from which they\ndetermined that the upflowing ions were colder than the\nambient ions. Knudsen et al. [1998] demonstrated positive\ncorrelations between core (i.e., thermal and suprathermal)\nion energization and both electron directional particle flux\nand BBELF wave power measurements from the Freja sat-\nellite at altitudes between 1400 and 1700 km. They reported\nthresholds in both electron flux and wave power for the\nonset of ion energization.\n[6] This article focuses on low\u2010altitude thermal ion\nupflow observations gathered on a sounding rocket in\nproximity to the dayside cusp. What distinguishes this study\nfrom those based on radars is the combined in situ mea-\nsurement of ion upflow and the precipitating electrons, as\nwell as the high temporal and spatial resolutions of the\nmeasurements. Another distinctive element of this study is\nthat our ion measurements, in contrast to those obtained\nfrom devices such as the ion drift meter [e.g., Heelis and\nHanson, 1998, and references therein], are derived from a\nrecently developed technique based on an imaging charged\nparticle analyzer that measures ion two\u2010dimensional energy\/\nangle distributions. These ion distributions allow us to val-\nidate an analyzer model that assists in the derivation of the\nion upflow and temperature measurements, and that we use\nto quantify the measurement uncertainties.\n[7] As will be shown, the observations provide compel-\nling evidence for precipitating soft electron energy flux as a\ndriver of the observed topside cusp ion upflow. In section 2\nwe provide an overview of the observations. Section 3 pre-\nsents the results of our investigation, which are discussed\nand summarized in section 4. Details on the ion image\nanalysis techniques, including error analysis, are presented\nin Appendix A.\n2.

Instrumentation\n[9] In situ measurements that are available for this study\ninclude low\u2010energy (0\u201325 eV) ions from the Suprathermal\nIon Imager (SII), energetic (0.01\u201330 keV) electron dis-\ntributions from a top hat electrostatic analyzer (Energetic\nElectron Detector (EED)), DC\u2010 and AC\u2010coupled electric\nfield measurements (0\u201310 kHz) from the Electric Field\nExperiment (EFE), and electron density and temperature\nfrom a swept\u2010bias spherical Langmuir probe (LP). The\nlayout of the SII, the EED, the LP, and the EFE (spheres 1\nand 2 only) sensors on the payload are illustrated schemat-\nically in Figure 1a (not to scale).\n[10] The Cusp\u20102002 SII (Figure 1b) analyzed core ion\nenergy distributions throughout the flight. In contrast to\nspectrometers such as the top hat [e.g., Carlson et al., 1982],\nwhich scan through the range of kinetic energies, or devices\nbased on integral measurements such as the ion drift meter\n[e.g., Heelis and Hanson, 1998], the SII is an energy\/angle\u2010\nof\u2010arrival analyzer that produces images representing 2\u2010D\nslices through the ion energy distribution function. These\nion images are the basis for measuring ion upflows and\ntemperatures on this flight. A full description of the SII\ndesign and operation can be found in the work by Knudsen\net al. [2003]. In brief, ions within the sensor\u2019s field of view\n(\u223c5\u00b0 \u00d7 360\u00b0) enter and cross the gap between the two\nhemispherical electrodes (Figure 1b). A constant voltage\nDV applied across the electrodes creates a radial electric\nfield which disperses the ions according to their kinetic\nenergy per unit charge: ions with greater kinetic energy\nreach the microchannel plate (MCP) intensifier at greater\nradii. The intensified signal is projected onto a phosphor\nscreen (not shown), which is connected to a charge\u2010coupled\ndevice (CCD) by a coherent fibre optic cable. A digital\nsignal processor reads out the CCD and prepares the images\nfor telemetry to ground. For this mission ion images were\nacquired 83 times per second.\n[11] A number of ground\u2010based instruments were operated\nin support of the flight; here we summarize only those relevant\nto this paper. Ionospheric convection maps were obtained\nat a 2 minute cadence from the CUTLASS SuperDARN\nradars at Hankasalmi and \u00deykkvib\u00e6r running in stereo\nmode [Lester et al., 2004].

For reasons described\nbelow, analysis of SII data is limited to the period 400\u2013680 s\nafter launch. Two upflow events are evident: one between 470\nand 575 s centered near apogee reaching speeds of 1 km s\u22121,\nand a narrower one of less than 500 m s\u22121 between 660 and\n680 s at \u223c670\u2013630 km altitude. Significant downflows are\nobserved before each upflow event. Estimates of mean thermal\nion energies (i.e., temperatures) parallel (Tik) and perpendic-\nular (Ti?) to the geomagnetic field are shown in Figure 2f.\nIsotropic temperatures hovered near 0.2\u20130.3 eV for most of\nthis event. As will be discussed in section 3, the somewhat\nanisotropic temperature enhancements within the upflow\nregions do not correlate with any of the irregularities seen in\nthe AC electric field. Detailed analysis of the ion upflow and\ntemperature are presented in Appendix A.\n[16] Electron temperatures obtained from the Langmuir\nprobe are shown in Figure 2g. Compared with typical\nelectron temperatures in the topside polar ionosphere, the\nelectron temperature was elevated and variable throughout\nmost of the flight.\n[17] Figure 2h summarizes the electron density measure-\nments estimated from the Langmuir probe. At apogee the\ndensity was about 1 \u00d7 1010 m\u22123. The payload crossed the\npeak of the F region ionosphere at an altitude between 300\nand 400 km.\n2.3. Supporting Observations\n[18] The evolution of the ionospheric convection flows\ntraversed by the payload is presented in Figure 3. Shown are\ntest particle convection trajectories (thin, dotted curves)\nderived from the SuperDARN CUTLASS radar measure-\nments, along with the footprint of the payload (thick, solid\ncurve), in AACGM coordinates. The flows and the payload\ntrack are mapped to a common altitude of 325 km. Apogee\nis marked with the diamond labeled \u201cA.\u201d The test particle\ntrajectories were obtained by interpolating successive\n2 minute SuperDARN velocity field maps backward and\nforward in time at 20 s intervals from points located every\n60 s along the rocket trajectory. Labels \u201c910 s\u201d and \u201c70 s\u201d at\nthe far left and right of the plot, respectively, indicate the\ntime in seconds after launch that the corresponding test\nparticle intercepts the payload. For example, the test particle\nthat intercepted the payload at 70 s traversed from 72.6\u00b0N \u00d7\n117.5\u00b0E at 1112:58 UT to 77.6\u00b0N \u00d7 119.3\u00b0E at 1122:38 UT,\nand the test particle that intercepted the payload at 910 s\ntraversed from 70.1\u00b0N \u00d7 91.5\u00b0E at 1129:58 UT to 71.6\u00b0N \u00d7\n85.0\u00b0E at 1136:18 UT. For reference the magnetic local\ntimes of these two interceptions are indicated by the MLT\nlabels. Labels \u201c400 s\u201d and \u201c680 s\u201d mark the beginning and\nend, respectively, of the SII data interval of Figure 2. The\ntrajectories represent the average convective motion on time\nscales of minutes; it is clear from the in situ measurements\nshown in Figure 2d that the convection electric fields were\nhighly dynamic during the flight. The ionospheric convec-\ntion pattern showed a number of dynamic features associ-\nated with changes in magnetopause reconnection and\nchanges in the IMF, but overall the convection was typical\nof that in the dayside section of the dusk convection cell of\nan asymmetric twin cell convection pattern with predomi-\nnantly antisunward and westward flows, with some eastward\nflows observed early in the rocket flight in the north east. In\ncrossing from the region of eastward flow to the region of\nwestward flow, the payload made the transition from open\nfield lines characterized by high radar spectral widths, to\nclosed field lines with lower spectral widths.\n[19] Altitude\u2010time plots of the ionospheric parameters\nmeasured by the ESR are shown in Figure 4. From top to\nbottom the panels show electron density, electron tempera-\nture, ion temperature, and bulk ion flow in the direction of\nthe geomagnetic field. ESR data were averaged in time\nusing a 128 s sliding window. The transient enhancements\nin electron density and temperature are signatures of elec-\ntron precipitation, either pulsed in time, or passing through\nthe radar\u2019s field of view. The ion temperature occasionally\nreaches \u223c0.3 eV, and the bulk ion upflow reaches \u223c200 m s\u22121.\nThe enhanced ion temperature and upflow enhancements\nseen in Figure 4 are qualitatively consistent with the in situ\nFigure 3.

Ion Energy\/Angle Images\n[20] Inspection of the full SII data set has revealed that the\nhighest\u2010quality ion images are obtained when the SII aper-\nture has an unobstructed view of the flowing plasma.\nTherefore we have selected for analysis rocket spin angles\nfor which the entrance aperture plane is within \u00b120\u00b0 (for ion\nupflow analysis) and \u00b110\u00b0 (for ion temperature analysis) of\nthe component of rammed flow (in the payload frame) that\nis perpendicular to the spin axis. We have excluded images\nthat show evidence of contamination due to detector satu-\nration, and we have used housekeeping monitor data to\neliminate images obtained during attitude control system\nmaneuvers and anomalous fluctuations from the high\u2010volt-\nage power supply. Due to an anomaly, sunlight contami-\nnation was evident in the SII images; we have corrected this\neffect by removing a thin\u2010plate spline fit to the smoothly\nvarying contamination, leaving the relatively structured ion\nsignal intact. Thus the ion upflow velocity and temperature\nmeasurements presented in this paper are based on cleaned,\nspin\u2010phase\u2010limited ion images between 400 s and 680 s.\n[21] Figure 5 shows the payload altitude versus time along\nwith representative examples of the ion data before (T +\n427.137 s) (Figure 5a), within (T + 509.277 s) (Figure 5b),\nand after (T + 600.627 s) (Figure 5c) the large upflow event\nnear apogee shown in Figure 2d. Assuming the ions are\nsingly ionized, the dashed circular fiducials represent kinetic\nenergies of 2 eV and 10 eV. The projection of the magnetic\nfield in the imaging plane is shown by the arrow labeled\n\u201cB.\u201d The upflow measurements depend on knowledge of the\nrotation and center of the SII coordinate system, which were\ncalibrated in the lab (from images of N2\n+ ion beams) and\nagain in flight. The intensity scale is linear in pixel count\nrate, and the white contour levels have equal spacings in\ncount rate. Each image was integrated for approximately\n12 ms. The component of the payload motion vrk antiparallel\nto ~B0 is shown for each case.\n[22] The ion signal in Figure 5a is displaced predomi-\nnantly laterally along the positive vx axis, and slightly\ndownward along the negative vy axis. The lateral displace-\nment results from a combination of the motion of the rocket\npayload across geomagnetic field lines and an electrical bias\nof the SII\u2019s skin of \u22122 V with respect to the payload\npotential Fpayload. The purpose of the skin bias is to ensure\nthat the analyzer acquires ion signal by presenting an\nattractive potential to the ions, and it results in a minimum\nkinetic energy per unit charge for the detected ions. The\nradial and azimuthal spread of the ion signal is a convolution\nof the thermal width of the ion distribution with focusing\nand scattering properties of the detector. The difference in\nFigure 4. Svalbard Radar observations around the time of the Cusp\u20102002 rocket flight. From top to\nbottom: electron density, electron temperature, ion temperature, and ion flow parallel to the geomagnetic\nfield direction. Positive flow values represent bulk ion motion away from the Earth.\nBURCHILL ET AL.: CUSP THERMAL ION UPFLOW A05206A05206\n6 of 16\nthe x and y widths of the signal is partly an effect of the skin\nbiasing, but we will show later that the ion temperatures\nperpendicular and parallel to~B0, respectively, can be derived\nfrom these widths; it is these temperatures that are sum-\nmarized in Figure 2f. The center of the signal is positioned\nslightly below the vx axis; since the vy axis is approximately\nantiparallel to ~B0, this signal represents an ion distribution\nthat, in the instrument frame of reference, has a downward\nbulk motion of approximately 400 m s\u22121 in the direction\nparallel to ~B0. At this time, however, the rocket is moving\nupward at approximately 400 m s\u22121 antiparallel to ~B0, so\nthere is no bulk flow along ~B0 in the frame corotating with\nthe Earth.\n[23] In Figure 5b the ion signal is noticeably displaced\nupward along the vy axis, which corresponds to an upflow in\nthe rocket frame. This image was obtained just after apogee\nwhere the component of the payload\u2019s velocity parallel to~B0\nis negligible, so an upflow in the instrument frame\nrepresents a bulk upflow of ions antiparallel to ~B0 in the\nEarth frame. The image shown in Figure 5b corresponds to\nthe >500 m s\u22121 upflow summarized in Figure 2e. We will\nrefer to this upflow feature as the \u201cmain upflow event.\u201d A\nsecond, narrower, upflow event is evident between 660 s\nand 680 s after launch.\n[24] The ion signal in Figure 5c is also displaced upward\nalong the vy axis, and in the instrument frame corresponds to\nbulk motion of \u223c600 m s\u22121 upward. At this time, however,\nthe payload is falling back to Earth with a speed along~B0 of\napproximately 600 m s\u22121, so in the Earth frame there is no\nupflow. Examining Figure 2e further, we point out (1) a\nsignificant amount of scatter in the upflow measurements,\non the order of \u00b1100 m s\u22121 or more, and (2) some narrow\n\u201cdownflow\u201d jets near 440 s and 650 s, reaching several\nhundreds of meters per second toward the F region.\n[25] Figure 6 presents a calibration of the ion flow compo-\nnent parallel to the rocket\u2019s spin axis towithin a constant offset\nrepresenting the average upflow velocity over the measure-\nment period. The image first moment y (equation (A2))\nquantifies the mean location of the ion signal along the\nFigure 5.

The dashed line was fit\nby hand to pass through the (almost) linear parts of the\ndata, namely the intervals from \u2212650 to \u2212400 m s\u22121, 400 to\n1000 m s\u22121, and 1300 to 1400 m s\u22121.\nBURCHILL ET AL.: CUSP THERMAL ION UPFLOW A05206A05206\n7 of 16\nsensor\u2019s vy axis. As shown in Appendix A, y is proportional\nto the component of bulk ion velocity along the vy axis in the\ninstrument frame. This bulk ion motion consists mostly of\nram flow due to the motion of the rocket through the plasma,\nand partly of ~E \u00d7 ~B drift due to the small (a few degrees)\nmisalignment between the spin axis and the direction of ~B0.\nLacking an independent measurement of the ion upflow we\nassume that the average upflow is zero and fit a straight line\nby hand to pass through the (almost) linear parts of the data.\nDetails on obtaining ion upflows and temperatures from the\nion images, including error analysis, are presented in\nAppendix A.\n3. Results\n[26] To investigate the electrodynamics of the ion upflow\nshown in Figure 2, in this section we examine its relation-\nship to the precipitating electron energy flux, the convection\nelectric field magnitude, the total AC electric field wave\npower, and the ion temperatures.\n[27] The main result of this paper is based on the rela-\ntionship between ion upflow and energy flux Ge of down-\ngoing soft electrons, plotted on a log linear scale in Figure 7.\nSince the electron energy fluxmeasurements were obtained at\na lower cadence than the ion upflow measurements, we have\ndown\u2010sampled the ion data at the EED measurement times.\nThe vertical dashed line is reproduced from Figure A4 and\nshows the energy flux above which the upflow measure-\nments may be significantly affected by payload potential\n(see section A3 for an explanation of the effect of payload\npotential on the ion measurements). Inspection of the plot\nindicates a clear relation between vk and log10Ge. The cor-\nrelation coefficient (i.e., Pearson R) of the 162 points in the\nrange 1\u201330 \u00d7 1010 eV cm\u22122 s\u22121 is R = 0.62, which by itself is\nnot conclusive but is consistent with the obvious trend seen\nin Figure 7. A straight line model least absolute deviation fit\nof the upflow versus logarithm of the energy flux over the\nrange 1\u201330 \u00d7 1010 eV cm\u22122 s\u22121 gives\nvk ms\u00021\n\u0001 \u0003 \u0003 \u00024920\u00fe 491\u0004 log10 \u0001e eV cm\u00022 s\u00021\u0001 \u0003: \u00f01\u00de\nFor comparison, a linear model between upflow and energy\nflux gives vk (m s\n\u22121) = 1.7 \u00d7 102 + 2.1 \u00d7 10\u22129Ge (eV cm\n\u22122 s\u22121);\nthe correlation for this model is 10% smaller (R = 0.56).\nIn the analysis that follows we have excluded the small\npopulation of data points corresponding to Ge \u2265 3 \u00d7 1011 eV\ncm\u22122 s\u22121 for which payload potential effects may be\nimportant.\n[28] In Figure 8 we note a tendency for the largest ion\nupflows to be associated with the smallest DC electric fields.\nThis is opposite to what one would predict if ion upflow\nwere driven by frictional heating from large convection\nelectric fields in the E region ionosphere below the payload.\n[29] Next we examine plasma waves as a possible driver\nof ion upflow. Figure 9 shows that there are small but sta-\ntistically significant associations between ion upflow and the\nlogarithm of the total wave power (measured from the EFE\n1\u20132 double probe) in each of the following frequency bands:\nVLF hiss, 5\u201310 kHz (Figure 9a); broadband ELF (BBELF),\n0\u20131 kHz (Figure 9b); O+ cyclotron frequencies, 30\u201350 Hz\n(Figure 9c); and H+ cyclotron frequencies, 600\u2013640 Hz\n(Figure 9d). The correlation is highest for the VLF hiss band\n(R = 0.33, 5 < f < 10 kHz), and lowest for the H+ cyclotron\nband (R = 0.27, 0 < f < 1 kHz). The correlations are each\nbased on 67 data points; the smallest (R = 0.27) is significant\nat the 97% confidence level.\n[30] Figure 10a reveals that there is a systematic variation\nof Tik with ion upflow (R = 0.81 for 687 points). The same\ntrend is exhibited by Ti? (Figure 10b, R = 0.70). If indeed it\nis a real effect, it suggests that there is energy flow from the\nsoft electrons to the ionospheric ions in the form of heat. A\npossible explanation lies in the plasma waves generated by\nthe electron beam: the larger upflows correspond to ions that\nmay have been accelerating for longer periods, and have\ntherefore had more time to interact with beam\u2010driven plasma\nwaves, resulting in higher temperatures. The apparent lack\nof a strong correlation between upflow and wave power in\nFigure 7. Ion upflow versus 0\u00b0\u201345\u00b0 electron energy flux.\nThe upflow has been down\u2010sampled to the EED measure-\nment times.

For the\ndata above 70 mV m\u22121, R = \u22120.03; for the data below\n70 mV m\u22121, R = \u22120.38.\nBURCHILL ET AL.: CUSP THERMAL ION UPFLOW A05206A05206\n8 of 16\nany of the bands presented above does not preclude this\nexplanation because some of the waves may be of nonlocal\norigin. Although the underlying trends in Figure 10 are\nstatistically significant, we cannot rule out the possibility\nthat they arise from an uncorrected instrumental effect of\nunknown origin.\n[31] There are clear departures from the trend in Figure 10b,\nat upflows of 0\u2013500 m s\u22121. These enhancements are indic-\native of very weak transverse acceleration of ions.\n4. Discussion and Summary\n[32] The observations summarized in Figure 2 directly\nrelate the magnitude of ion upflow to the electron energy\ninput into the dayside cusp ionosphere. They are consistent\nwith work by Wahlund et al. [1992], Horwitz and Moore\n[1997], Moen et al. [2004], and others who have reported\na link between electron precipitation and ion upflow in the\ncusp ionosphere. The absence of significant ion heating and\nlack of correlation with \u2223~E\u2223 indicates that either the con-\nvection electric field does not play a significant role in the\nupflow for this event, or its influence is buried in the time\nhistory of the ionospheric transport. Further study, involving\nground\u2010based radar and IMAGE satellite observations, will\nbe needed to determine whether the upflow is caused by\nenhancements in the ambipolar electric field due to increased\nionospheric electron temperature [e.g., Whitteker, 1977], by\nparallel electric fields that arise from plasma instabilities [e.g.,\nSt.\u2010Maurice et al., 1996] or conversion of convection elec-\ntric fields [Kagan and St.\u2010Maurice, 2005], or by other\nphysics. Due to overcast sky conditions during the flight, we\ndo not have information to verify the details of the arc\ngeometry and movement that are needed to investigate the\ndetails of the upflow mechanism(s). In any case the\nupflowing ions may possibly reach altitudes above the pay-\nload where other energization mechanisms can take hold,\nleading to escape of ionospheric plasma into the magneto-\nsphere, as suggested by Bering et al. [1975], Shelley et al.\n[1982], and others.\n[33] Wilson et al. [2001] describe the relationship between\nenergetic upward O+ ion flux and auroral emission in the\nmolecular nitrogen Lyman\u2010Birge\u2010Hopfield long band at\n1700 \u00c5 in the nightside auroral zone. Based on this asso-\nciation, and the fact that the intensity in the LBH band is\nproportional to the energy flux of the precipitating electrons,\nthey conclude that \u201cthe O+ escape flux is a function of the\nprecipitating electron energy flux or a closely related\nquantity.\u201d Our Figure 7 illustrates one such functional\ndependence, albeit our upflows do not represent escape flux.\nFigure 9.

[2005],\nusing high\u2010altitude satellite observations (4000 km and\n6000 km, respectively), found no statistically significant\ncorrelation between outflow flux and the energy flux of\nprecipitating electrons. They found instead empirical power\nlaw relationships between ion outflow flux and electron\ndensity. Scaling our measurements to 4000 km, the corre-\nlation for a power law relationship between upflow flux and\nprecipitating electron density [Strangeway et al., 2005,\nequation (2)] is R = 0.41. There are several reasons, how-\never, to expect our results not to be directly comparable with\nthose at high altitude. Our upflow observations do not rep-\nresent outflow (escape) flux; additional mechanisms, such as\nacceleration by plasma waves, are needed to explain the\nhigh\u2010altitude fluxes. Moreover, as Strangeway et al. [2005]\nand Zheng et al. [2005] pointed out, their energy flux\nmeasurements included higher\u2010energy electrons which are\nnot as effective at driving upflow as the soft electrons, and\nthis could be expected to diminish the correlations. This\npoint is supported by the Freja satellite observations (at\naltitudes near 1700 km) of Knudsen et al. [1998] (Plate 3,\nlower left panel) that showed significant correlation between\nion energization and precipitating electron number flux only\nfor electron energies less than about 500 eV. The acciden-\ntally resonant charge exchange O+ + H \u2192 O + H+ [e.g.,\nMoore, 1980] also complicates comparisons between low\u2010\nand high\u2010altitude fluxes. Furthermore, there is the issue of\ntiming, which affects the interpretation of the correlation\nbetween ion outflow and electron density summarized in\nFigure 1 of Strangeway et al. [2005]. Soft electrons mea-\nsured at 4000 km take at most a few seconds to reach the\nionosphere, whereas the resulting ion upflows take many\ntens of minutes to reach altitudes where transverse acceler-\nation of ions by plasma waves dominates the upflow\ndynamics. Convection of the upflowing ions must, there-\nfore, be a consideration when performing point\u2010by\u2010point\ncorrelative studies at high altitudes. Given that Poynting\nflux, ELF waves, and electron precipitation are all features\nof the cusp region [e.g., Strangeway et al., 2005], it is\npossible that some of the high\u2010altitude correlation between\nion outflow and electron precipitation is coincidental.\nNevertheless, it is clear that soft electrons do influence ion\nupflow in the cusp topside ionosphere, and the correlations\nof Strangeway et al. [2005], Zheng et al. [2005], and\nKnudsen et al. [1998] may be signaling that the ionosphere,\nas a source of plasma, plays an important role in regulating\nhigh\u2010altitude outflow mechanisms.\n[35] One explanation for the negative correlation in\nFigure 8 is that the electric fields are shorted out from\nenhanced ionospheric conductivity where the electron pre-\ncipitation is strongest. There is considerable scatter in the\ndata of Figure 8, however, and some of the weaker electric\nfields may have their origin in other mechanisms.\n[36] The correspondence between vk and Tik and Ti? is\nqualitatively in agreement with the ground\u2010based radar\nobservations of Moen et al. [2004]. Our results are also\nconsistent with Ogawa et al. [2000], who found no link\nbetween the strength of the convection and ion upflow using\nground based radars. The trends in Figure 10 of increasing\nion temperatures with upflow velocity are qualitatively\nsimilar to Figure 2 (lower panel) of Seo et al. [1997], which\nwere obtained using a different measurement technique; this\nsupports the interpretation that these trends are physical and\nnot instrumental in origin.\n[37] There is considerable scatter in the upflow measure-\nments. In the case of the SII data, there is inherent noise in\nthe ion upflow and temperature measurements due to photon\nand MCP pulse height distribution counting statistics\n[Knudsen et al., 2003]. For the Cusp\u20102002 SII, counting\nstatistics can account for root\u2010mean\u2010square noise levels in\nthe upflow and ion temperature measurements of 17 m s\u22121\nand 0.012 eV, respectively. Variations in spacecraft poten-\ntial and the analyzer electrode voltages also contribute to the\nscatter. Moreover, the temporal history and spatial varia-\ntion of the momentum and energy flows throughout the\nionosphere can weaken the correlations between plasma\nparameters.\n[38] The presence of an electron energy flux threshold for\nthe onset of ion upflow may be a clue to the nature of the\nupflow process. Lower\u2010energy fluxes may drive upflows\nbelow the rocket, for example, which do not have enough\nspeed to reach the payload altitude. Further investigation is\nneeded on this aspect of the observations.\n[39] It is known that the neutral atmosphere plays a role in\nionospheric transport [e.g., Moore, 1980; Lockwood, 1984],\nFigure 10. Ion temperature versus upflow. (a) Tik (R = 0.81).\n(b) Ti? (R = 0.70).\nBURCHILL ET AL.: CUSP THERMAL ION UPFLOW A05206A05206\n10 of 16\nparticularly in view of the CHAMP satellite observations of\nthermospheric upwelling near the cusp by L\u00fchr et al.\n[2004], and the lower\u2010altitude Streak satellite observations\nof reduced thermospheric density in the southern cusp by\nClemmons et al. [2008]. In situ ion upflow and temperature\nmeasurements of the kind presented here, coupled with\nthermospheric measurements, may help in future to eluci-\ndate the role of the ionosphere in governing or responding to\nthis redistribution of neutral atmosphere.\n[40] This study provides a new perspective on observa-\ntions of ion upflow in the cusp ionosphere. We summarize\nthe main findings as follows.\n[41] 1. There is a positive correlation between the mag-\nnitude of the ion upflow and the logarithm of the precipi-\ntating magnetosheath electron energy flux (R = 0.62) for\nfluxes greater than about 1010 eV cm\u22122 s\u22121 (Figure 7).\n[42] 2. Ion upflow is not observed for electron energy\nfluxes less than about 1010 eV cm\u22122 s\u22121 (Figure 7).\n[43] 3. At Cusp\u20102002 altitudes, the ion upflow does\nnot correlate with convection electric fields greater than\n70 mV m\u22121 (R = \u22120.03). There is a slightly negative cor-\nrelation (R = \u22120.38) between ion upflow and \u2223~E\u2223 for field\nmagnitudes less than about 70 mV m\u22121 (Figure 8). One\npossible explanation for this inverse relationship is that the\nelectron precipitation leads to enhanced ionospheric con-\nductivity and hence weaker electric fields.\n[44] 4. Ion upflow correlates weakly with wave power in\nthe VLF (R = 0.33) and BBELF (R = 0.27) bands (Figure 9).\n[45] 5. There are positive correlations between ion upflow\nand the parallel (R = 0.81) and perpendicular (R = 0.70) ion\ntemperatures (Figure 10).\n[46] 6. Observations of ion downflows (as large as\n\u2212400 m s\u22121) at the downstream edges of the upflow regions\nare indicative of a return to equilibrium outside the electron\nprecipitation regions (Figure 2).\nAppendix A\n[47] Here we provide details on the ion image analysis\ntechniques used in this study. For the SII instrument there is\nnot a one\u2010to\u2010one mapping between per pixel count rates and\nphase space density. This, in combination with instrumental\neffects such as focusing aberrations, fringing electric fields,\nand mass ambiguities, makes it impossible to directly invert\nthe ion images into velocity distribution functions. Instead\nwe use a forward modeling technique that simulates ion\nimages by modeling the distribution function and its inter-\naction with the probe. By calculating moments of the sim-\nulated images we can characterize the SII\u2019s response to a\nrange of ion velocities, temperatures, and floating potentials.\nA1. SII Model\n[48] We refined the SII model of Burchill et al. [2004] by\nsimulating the effect of fringing electric fields within the\nanalyzer on the ion images. Fringing fields arise predomi-\nnantly near the interface between the entrance window and\nthe gap between the hemispherical electrodes; we calculated\nthe fields by numerically solving (by successive over-\nrelaxation) Laplace\u2019s equation for a realistic analyzer\ngeometry and differentiating the potential. We traced parti-\ncles through the analyzer using an adaptive step\u2010size\nRunge\u2010Kutta integration scheme. Comparison of model\nimages with flight data showed that the model could be\nfurther refined by applying a single radially varying cor-\nrection for the potential between the analyzing electrodes.\nAt present the physical origin of this correction is not\nknown: it might arise from various effects such as electrode\ncontamination from oxidation, or a small displacement of\nthe inner hemispherical electrode with respect to the outer\none, as might happen during the sensor assembly process,\nfor example.\n[49] Figure A1a shows a simulation of the SII ion image at\n600.627 s (Figure 5c) using a model of the analyzer based\non Monte Carlo sampling of a drifting, isotropic Maxwellian\nO+ ion velocity distribution function. The Debye sheath\naround the SII\u2019s exterior is modeled using a thin\u2010sheath\napproximation [Burchill, 2003]. Lacking direct measure-\nments of the relative concentrations of various ion species,\nwe assume 100% O+ for this model; the resulting model\nimages are qualitatively consistent with the flight images\n(Figure A1a). Due to their larger thermal speeds, the pres-\nence of significant amounts of light ions, such as H+, would\ncause the ion signal to spread out and cover more of the\ndetector area; we do not observe this effect in any of the\nflight images. As for other heavy ions, such as N+, their\npresence would result in a small correction to the ion\nvelocities and temperatures. As discussed in section 2.4\nabove, we calibrated the ion upflow measurements, and\nthis calibration will be valid as long as the relative con-\ncentrations of various ion species does not vary significantly\nover the narrow altitude range (\u223c128 km) of the SII mea-\nsurements throughout the interval of interest.\nA2. Ion Image Analysis\n[50] Experience has shown that estimates of the ion drift\nperpendicular to ~B0 are given by x centroids of the image\nx \u00bc 1\nS\nX\ni;j\nCijxij; \u00f0A1\u00de\nwhere Cij and xij are the counts and x position (in pixels),\nrespectively, of the pixel at the intersection of the ith column\nand jth row, and S = Si,j Cij is the sum of the image counts.\nThese centroids can be calibrated using the ~E \u00d7 ~B drift\nvelocity inferred from measurements of electric and mag-\nnetic fields [Burchill et al., 2004; Sangalli et al., 2009]. The\nCusp\u20102002 SII was aligned so that the geomagnetic field lay\nwithin a few degrees of the imaging (x, y) plane, which\nallows us to estimate ion upflows antiparallel to ~B0 from the\nimage first y moments, or y centroids of the image\ny \u00bc 1\nS\nX\ni;j\nCijyij; \u00f0A2\u00de\nwhere yij is the y position of the (i, j)th pixel. Figure A1b\nillustrates the geometry of the x and y centroids with\nrespect to the SII coordinate system and the ion signal.

Figure A2a demonstrates that, for constant skin\nbias voltage, we expect an approximately linear relationship\nbetween y and vk. The slope of the line depends on the bias\nvoltage and, to a lesser extent, on the ion temperature, but a\nuseful rule of thumb for the Cusp\u20102002 SII is\nvk ms\u00021\n\u0001 \u0003 \u0003 103y: \u00f0A6\u00de\nFigure A1.

The\nresponse is shown for flow angles \u0002 from 0\u00b0 to 70\u00b0 in 5\u00b0\nincrements. The largest upflows of \u223c1 km s\u22121 in Figure 2e\nreach flow angles of 70\u00b0, which, according to Figure A2b,\ncan account for a derived velocity error of at most 0.38 m s\u22121\nmV\u22121. Near apogee, where \u0002 is typically small, the upflow\nmeasurements are practically insensitive to variations in\nspacecraft potential. There is also a dependence of the\nestimated upflow on the second y moment, y2, as shown in\nFigure A2c. The effect is largest at large flow angles. We\ncorrected the ion upflow estimates for this effect using the\nmeasured values for \u0002 and y2.\n[52] Figure A3 summarizes the modeled dependence of\nion temperature on second moment (Figure A3a), ion flow\nangle (Figure A3b), and SII skin potential (Figure A3c). In\nFigure A3a, for a given floating potential and flow angle \u0002\nthere is a well\u2010defined monotonically increasing relationship\nbetween Ti and the second x and y moments, which we fit\nusing a polynomial model. The x and y second moments are\nequal at \u0002 = 45\u00b0. As shown in Figure A3b, for a given\nsecond moment, larger flow angles correspond to smaller\nion temperatures. This relationship arises from the non-\nsymmetric shape of the ion signal in the instrument frame,\nand we can correct for it. As Figure A3c shows, there is a\nsignificant dependence of the ion temperature on the pay-\nload floating potential. At small flow angles the effect is\nmost pronounced for Tik.\nA3. Effect of Payload Potential on Upflow\nMeasurement\n[53] An important point concerning the interpretation of\nlow\u2010energy ionospheric ion data is that the ions in the\nplasma frame have kinetic energies per unit charge on the\norder of, or less than, the electric potential surrounding\nthe payload. It is for this reason that the SII sensor is\nattached to the payload on a 1 m long boom. Nevertheless,\nchanges in payload potential Fpayload, to which the skin of\nthe SII is electrically biased, affect the ion images. The\nprincipal effect of payload potential variations on the ion\nimages is to change the minimum kinetic energy of the\ndetected ions, and this corresponds to variations in mean\nradial position of the signal r \u223c\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nx2 \u00fe y2\np\n. We are assuming\nthat the potential structure around the sensor is cylindrically\nsymmetric about the sensor\u2019s z axis. This assumption is\njustified by the fact that the sensor is mounted on the boom,\nmany tens of Debye lengths away from the payload sheath.\nIt is clear from the ion images in Figure 5 that the flow\nangles \u0002 are typically closer to 0\u00b0 than 90\u00b0, which means\nthat variations in F will have a relatively small impact on the\nparallel flow estimates derived from y, but will have a much\nlarger impact on perpendicular flows derived from x. For\nthis reason we have focused on the results derived from the\ny, x2 and y2 image moments, namely ion upflow and tem-\nperatures perpendicular and parallel to ~B0.\n[54] Accurate measurements of Fpayload from the Lang-\nmuir probe on 35.033 are not available, and we therefore\ncannot correct the ion flows for spacecraft potential varia-\ntions. We can nevertheless quantify the accuracy of our\nupflow measurements by assessing how much the spacecraft\nFigure A3. Modeled dependence of ion temperature on\n(a) image second moments x2 and y2 at three different flow\nangles, (b) flow angle \u0002 at three different values of x2, and\n(c) the magnitude of the SII skin potential Fskin = Fpayload \u2212\n2.0 V. The solid curves in Figures A3a and A3b are third\u2010\ndegree polynomial fits to the model values.\nBURCHILL ET AL.: CUSP THERMAL ION UPFLOW A05206A05206\n13 of 16\npotential can vary throughout the ion upflow measurement\ninterval.\n[55] Given that (1) the minimum current from ambient\nelectrons with Te \u223c 0.5 eV is on the order of ATneqevth,e \u223c\n\u22120.47AT mA m\u22122, where AT is the total spacecraft area;\n(2) the electron precipitation has a maximum current on the\norder of A?qeFe,max \u223c \u22120.016A? mA m\u22122, where A? is\nthe cross\u2010sectional area of the spacecraft that is seen by the\nprecipitating electrons, and Fe,max \u223c 1014 m\u22122 s\u22121 is the\nmaximum observed downgoing electron particle flux; and\n(3) the ratio AT\/A? is certainly greater than 1, it is unlikely\nthat the precipitating electrons can alter the total current to\nthe spacecraft by more than a few percent. From the typical\nCusp\u20102002 Langmuir probe characteristic curve in Figure 3\nof Steigies et al. [2005], we can relate the changes in total\ncurrent that are due to the \u223c10\u2013200 eV precipitating elec-\ntrons to changes in the floating potential as follows. The\nprobe diameter is 2.5 cm and it has a surface area of about\n5 cm2, which puts the ambient electron current near 0.24 mA.\nThe probe draws approximately this much current when it is\nat the plasma potential, which on the LP characteristic of\nSteigies et al. [2005] is about 1.4 V with respect to probe\nground. Here a change in the current of a few percent cor-\nresponds to a change in potential of no more than 200 mV.\nFor the extreme upflows at \u0002 = 70\u00b0, and recalling that a\nchange in y of 1 pixel corresponds to \u223c1000 m s\u22121 change in\nvk, the spacecraft potential variation can account for at most\n90 m s\u22121 of the upflow. Given that the preponderance of\nupflows occur at flow angles of less than 45\u00b0, and that most\nof the precipitating electron flux is less than half its maxi-\nmum value, we place a conservative 1 \u2212 s limit of \u00b150 m s\u22121\non uncertainties in the ion upflow measurements due to\nvariations in precipitating electron flux. The variability in\nfloating potential depends also on the changes in electron\ndensity and temperature (we assume that the flux of pho-\ntoelectrons coming from the payload is relatively constant\nover the measurement interval), so presumably some of the\nlow\u2010amplitude randomness in the upflow measurements\narises from these effects. We assume also that ionospheric\nphotoelectrons do not have enough flux to significantly alter\nthe spacecraft potential.\n[56] An estimate for Fpayload can be obtained from the\nDC\u2010coupled electric field data. VS1 (VS2) is the potential\ndifference between the payload and sphere 1 (sphere 2) of\nthe EFE 1\u20132 antenna (Figure 1). Hence, VS1 + VS2 is twice\nthe payload potential minus twice the average sphere\npotentials. Thus, the sum of these potential measurements\ndivided by two may be considered a proxy for the spacecraft\npotential, provided the sphere potential contribution is rel-\natively small in comparison. Note that for two opposing\nspheres at equal distances from the spacecraft (such as\nspheres 1 and 2 in the present study), the potential differ-\nences between each sphere and the spacecraft due to the\nambient electric field and the~v \u00d7 ~B motional emf are equal\nand opposite to each other and hence cancel. Figure A4\nshows the dependence of this spacecraft potential proxy,\nFproxy = (VS1 + VS2)\/2, on the precipitating electron energy\nflux Ge. The potential is stable up to an energy flux of \u223c3 \u00d7\n1011 eV cm\u22122 s\u22121, beyond which there is a noticeable drop.\nGiven that the electrons have kinetic energies of approxi-\nmately 50\u2013100 eV, this suggests that the payload potential is\naffected by precipitating electrons once the precipitating\nflux exceeds about 1% of the ambient electron flux, which is\non the order of 3.5 \u00d7 1011 cm\u22122 s\u22121. In sections 3 and 4 we\nhave drawn conclusions from ion upflow results for energy\nfluxes below the threshold where spacecraft potential effects\nare important.\nA4. Ion Temperature\n[57] As shown in Figure A3, estimates of ion temperature\nneed to include corrections for the dependence on flow\nangle and payload potential. We condensed these results\ninto a least squares two\u2010dimensional surface fit of Ti(x2, \u0002)\nand Ti(y2, \u0002) for Fskin = \u22122.0 V. Because we do not have\naccurate knowledge of the payload potential, we can only\nplace a limit on the variations in ion temperature presented\nin Figure 2e using our estimate of the variation in payload\npotential described above. We assume that the payload\npotential varies by at most \u00b1100 mV, which corresponds to\nan uncertainty of \u00b10.05 eV in the temperature estimates. It is\ndifficult to quantify the uncertainty in the measurement due\nto the ion distribution being non\u2010Maxwellian. Given that the\nESR measurements show ion temperatures near 0.2\u20130.3 eV\n(Figure 4), we suggest that the order of magnitude of our ion\ntemperatures is reasonable, but that the smaller\u2010amplitude\nvariations might include some instrumental effects. We note\nfurther that outside the upflow regions there is a tendency\nfor Tik to be somewhat larger than Ti?, but since we have no\nindependent in situ measurements it is not possible to\ndetermine whether there is a systematic error in one, both, or\nneither of the ion temperature components.\n[58] Acknowledgments.
