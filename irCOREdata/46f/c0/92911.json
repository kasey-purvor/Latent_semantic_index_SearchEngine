The danger exists that \npolicy-makers will dismiss HIW as an individual responsibility due to the influence of \ndispositional factors.  \n \nOriginality\/Value - This study indicates that self-evaluation personality characteristics play a \nkey role in predicting HIW, and are more important than traditionally investigated factors \nassociated with the home and workplace environments. \n \nArticle type: Research paper \n \nKeywords: \nWork-home interference \nPersonality \nPerfectionism \nSelf-esteem \nSelf-efficacy \nWork-family culture \n   \n \n \n3 \n \nPersonality is widely acknowledged as having an impact on a number of job-related \noutcomes. Researchers have argued in favour of dispositional explanations for job satisfaction \n(Arvey, Carter, & Buerkley, 1991), managerial effectiveness (House, Howard, & Walker, \n1991), organizational citizenship behaviour (Borman, Penner, Allen & Motowidlo, 2001), and \nwork stress (Chiu & Kosinski, 1999). Research on personality-based antecedents of \nwork-home interference, however, is still in its infancy.  \nWork-home interference is a form of inter-role conflict in which the demands of the \nwork role and the demands of the home role are mutually incompatible (Parasuraman & \nGreenhaus, 1997), such that meeting demands in one domain (e.g., home) makes it difficult to \nmeet demands in the other (e.g., work). Research has established the appropriateness of \ndifferentiating between work interference with home (WIH), in which work activities impede \nperformance of family or other non-work roles, and home interference with work (HIW), in \nwhich life-role responsibilities hinder performance at work (Frone, Russell, & Cooper, 1992). \nWhile work-home interference is typically characterized in the literature by time-based and \nstrain-based demands, a mismatch between behaviours required in one role with behaviours \nappropriate in another role can contribute to behaviour-based interference (Greenhaus & \nBeutell, 1985).  \nExisting research on antecedents to work-home interference tends to focus on \nsituational predictors, such as work hours, mental and physical job requirements, and \norganizational work-home culture (Carnicer, S\u00e1nchez, & P\u00e9rez, 2004; Thompson, Beauvais, \n& Lyness, 1999). However, Friede & Ryan\u2019s (2005) model proposes three ways in which \ndispositional factors may influence the work-home interface. Personality may affect the type \nand amount of work and home role requirements that an individual experiences; it may \ninfluence an individual\u2019s perceptions of work and home role requirements; and it may influence \n   \n \n \n4 \n \nthe coping strategies used to deal with interference between work and home, in turn affecting \nthe degree of emotional strain or enrichment experienced.  \nEmpirical results of the fledgling literature on personality-based antecedents have been \nencouraging. Work by Wayne, Musisca, and Fleeson (2004) has found a positive link between \nneuroticism and both directions of work-home interference, and a negative link between \nconscientiousness and work-home interference. Negative affectivity has also been positively \nrelated to both WIH and HIW (Bruck & Allen, 2003; Carlson, 1999), and in a study by \nBonebright, Clay, and Ankenmann (2000), workaholics were found to have significantly more \nwork-life conflict than nonworkaholics. \nWhile there are undoubtedly a number of dispositional characteristics capable of \ninfluencing the interface between work and home, Friede and Ryan (2005) suggest that \nself-evaluations are particularly likely to have an effect on work-home perceptions and \nrealities. Judge, Erez, and Bono (1998) have noted that self-consistency theory (Korman, 1970) \nsuggests that individuals will seek out and be satisfied with roles that maximize cognitive \nconsistency; those with more positive self-evaluations will choose situations in which they can \nbe effective, and avoid those in which they cannot. Individuals with negative self-evaluations \nmay actually experience more home and work stressors, and therefore perceive greater \ninterference (Friede & Ryan, 2005). General self-esteem and generalized self-efficacy are part \nof core self-evaluations (Judge, Locke, & Durham, 1997), defined as the fundamental premises \nindividuals hold about themselves or the extent to which individuals possess a positive \nself-concept (Judge, Erez, & Bono, 1998). Perfectionism also taps into self-evaluations with \nregard to personal standards for performance. For these reasons, these three dispositional \nvariables have been selected for investigation in the present study.  \n \n \n   \n \n \n5 \n \nThis study has two aims. The first is to investigate the effect of additional personality \ncharacteristics (beyond those addressed previously in the literature) on time-, strain-, and \nbehaviour-based work interference with home, and on time-, strain-, and behaviour-based \nhome interference with work. Perfectionism, self-efficacy, and self-esteem have unique \npotential to affect employees\u2019 perceptions of work-home interference, due to the implications \nof these traits for individuals\u2019 tendencies to evaluate in either positive or negative terms their \nability to deal with the situations in which they find themselves. This study will attempt to \nascertain if these dispositional variables contribute to any variance in work-home interference \nbeyond that explained by demographic control variables and known situational antecedents.  \nThe second aim of this study is to compare the impact on work-home interference of \ndispositional variables with that of situational variables, and ascertain which explains a greater \namount of variance in interference. Because the majority of work-home research tests only \nsituational antecedents to interference, there is an assumption among researchers that \nsituational characteristics are more important than dispositional ones in explaining variance in \ninterference. In addition, because a number of the studies investigating dispositional \nantecedents to work-home interference have not included situational variables (e.g., \nBonebright et al., 2000; Bruck & Allen, 2003; Wayne et al., 2004), the relative merits of \nsituational vs. dispositional variables in explaining variance in interference are unknown.  \nDispositional Antecedents \nPerfectionism  \nPerfectionism has been defined as \u201can extreme or excessive striving for perfection, as in \none\u2019s work\u201d (Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary, 1988, p. 873). Research indicates \nthat on a global level, perfectionism is best construed as two largely independent dimensions \ndistinguishing between positive and negative aspects of the construct: adaptive and \n   \n \n \n6 \n \nmaladaptive perfectionism (Slaney, Rice, Mobley, Trippi, and Ashby, 2001; Stumpf and \nParker, 2000).  \nBoth adaptive and maladaptive perfectionism are characterized by the setting of high \npersonal standards for one\u2019s work or behaviour. The difference between the two lies in their \nresponse to a failure to achieve those standards. Adaptive perfectionists perceive a low level of \ndistress resulting from the discrepancy between their personal standards and their performance, \nwhile maladaptive perfectionists perceive a high level of distress. Adaptive and maladaptive \nperfectionism do not appear to be opposite poles on a single continuum, but separate and \nlargely independent factors (Slaney et al., 2001; Stumpf & Parker, 2000).  \nAdaptive perfectionism. Adaptive perfectionists have been found to indicate \nsignificantly greater willingness to initiate behaviour and to expend effort in completing the \nbehaviour, more persistence in the face of adversity, and stronger belief in their ability to deal \nwith others effectively (LoCicero & Ashby, 2000). High personal standards may therefore help \nto enhance performance in both work and non-work roles, to manage competing demands from \nwork and home, and to transfer successful problem-solving techniques from one domain to the \nother, thus integrating work and home behaviours. Equally, individuals high in adaptive \nperfectionism are likely to remain undiscouraged by occasions in which work-home \ninterference occurs. Both of these elements are likely to contribute to lower levels of perceived \ninterference between work and home.  \nMaladaptive perfectionism. Individuals high in maladaptive perfectionism are \ncharacterized by tendencies for overly critical evaluations of their own behaviour (Frost, \nMarten, Lahart, & Rosenblate, 1990). They also frequently experience a vague sense of doubt \nabout the quality of their performance (Burns, 1980). Mitchelson and Burns (1998) found \nmaladaptive perfectionism to be related to exhaustion at work, parental distress at home, and a \ndecreased sense of overall satisfaction with life and satisfaction with self; they concluded that \n   \n \n \n7 \n \nmaladaptive perfectionists are more negatively affected by life stressors than people low in \nmaladaptive perfectionism.  \n If maladaptive perfectionists set high personal standards for balancing work and home, \nand then evaluate themselves critically, they are more likely to perceive interference between \nthe two when such high standards are not always met. Experiencing doubt about the quality of \ntheir performance might also lend itself to negative evaluation of their ability to balance \ncompeting work and home demands, and to successfully integrate behaviours used at home and \nat work. \nHypothesis 1: Adaptive perfectionism will be negatively related to WIH and HIW. \nHypothesis 2: Maladaptive perfectionism will be positively related to WIH and HIW. \nSelf-efficacy \nGeneral self-efficacy is described as a stable cognition that people hold and carry with \nthem, reflecting the expectation that they possess the ability to successfully perform tasks in a \nvariety of achievement situations (Riggs et al., 1994, cited in Gardner & Pierce, 1998). Bandura \n(1986) posited that an individual\u2019s level of self-efficacy can work to directly reduce perceptions \nof and reactions to strain. This notion is supported by research from Matsui & Onglatco (1992), \nwho found a significant negative relationship between self-efficacy and vocational strain, and \nBandura (1997), who described correlational and experimental studies demonstrating that high \nself-efficacy mitigates psychological states such as stress by directly impacting sensitivity to \nstressors. \nFurther support is provided by Judge, Locke, Durham, & Kluger (1998), who found that \ncore self-evaluations, primarily self-efficacy and self-esteem, influenced individuals\u2019 \nperceptions of work attributes such as autonomy and task significance. Individuals with \npositive self-concepts perceived more variety, challenge, control, and intrinsic worth in their \nwork. Those with low core self-evaluations were more inclined to rate their job attributes \n   \n \n \n8 \n \nnegatively, and to report less job and life satisfaction as a result. This has obvious implications \nfor the occurrence of interference between work and home, indicating that individuals with low \nself-efficacy are more sensitive to stressors and thus have an increased potential for both \nexperiencing strain and perceiving its diffusion across domains, whether from work to home or \nvice versa.  \nSelf-efficacy beliefs influence which stimuli people choose to pay attention to, whether \npeople appraise the situations in which they find themselves as positive or negative, and \nwhether they remember past situations as having been positive, neutral, or negative (Bandura, \n1997). All of these have the potential to influence employee experiences of interference \nbetween work and home. The more capable an individual feels of being able to successfully \nhandle the demands of work and home, the less interference between work and home s\/he is \nlikely to experience. Support for this proposition was found by Erdwins, Buffardi, Casper, and \nO\u2019Brien (2001), whose research demonstrated that high levels of task-specific self-efficacy \npertaining to job skills predicted lower levels of conflict between work and family.  \nHypothesis 3: Self-efficacy will be negatively related to WIH and HIW. \nSelf-esteem  \nSelf-esteem has been described as \u201cthe overall affective evaluation of one\u2019s own worth, \nvalue, or importance\u201d (Blascovich & Tomaka, 1991, p. 115). It is widely assumed that \nself-esteem is trait-like, and that levels of self-esteem are therefore stable over time within \nindividuals (Blascovich & Tomaka, 1991). Research has linked low self-esteem with \ndepression (Shaver & Brennan, 1990; Tennen & Herzberger, 1987), and high self-esteem with \ngreater task effort and persistence (Felson, 1984; McFarlin, Baumeister, & Blascovich, 1984). \nHigh self-esteem has also been found to correlate with increased satisfaction with career, \nmarriage, children, leisure, and friendships, as well as with a sense of being resolved (i.e., \nnon-conflicted) about the competing demands of career and family (Kinnier, Katz, & Berry, \n   \n \n \n9 \n \n1991). This tendency towards making positive evaluations of one\u2019s contractual and social \nrelationships, as well as to work harder toward the achievement of desired goals, suggests that \nindividuals with high self-esteem will be less likely to report negative outcomes such as \nincreased levels of work-home interference. \nSelf-esteem theory suggests that perceptions of self-worth play a key role in how \nindividuals both perceive and react to environmental stressors. Firstly, self-esteem is \nconsidered to be a resource that buffers the individual against stress (Rosenberg, 1979). \nIndividuals with high self-esteem may have a \u201creserve\u201d of self-worth and confidence upon \nwhich they can draw in problematic situations, such as dealing with the multiple role demands \nthat contribute to work-home interference. Those with high self-esteem may therefore express \nless concern about the performance of multiple roles, because they know they can cope with \nsuch an experience (Grandey & Cropanzano, 1999).  \nSecondly, Brockner\u2019s (1983) plasticity hypothesis posits that individuals with low \nself-esteem are more influenced by the environment than those with high self-esteem. As role \nstressors occur in the organizational and home environment, it is reasonable to assume on the \nbasis of the plasticity hypothesis that individuals with low self-esteem would be more affected \nby these stressors than those with high self-esteem. Both the stress-buffering and plasticity \nhypotheses therefore suggest that individuals with low self-esteem would be more likely to \nreport greater levels of work-home interference than would those with higher levels of \nself-worth. \nHypothesis 4: Self-esteem will be negatively related to WIH and HIW. \nSituational Antecedents \n A substantial number of situational factors have been found to predict work-home \ninterference among employees (for a review, see Eby, Casper, Lockwood, Bordeaux, & \nBrinley, 2005). Most of these involve situational elements of the workplace, rather than the \n   \n \n \n10 \n \nhome. However, the single most investigated situational antecedent of WHI is arguably the \npresence of dependant children in the household \u2013 a home-related characteristic found to \npredict both increased WIH and HIW by virtue of increased home-related demands (Carlson, \n1999; Kinnunen & Mauno, 1998; Saltzstein, Ting, & Saltzstein, 2001).  \nAmong the work-related situational contributors, a key antecedent to WHI established \nin the literature is the number of hours worked per week. By increasing the amount of time \nspent in the work domain and reducing the time available for fulfilling responsibilities at home, \ngreater work hours often result in higher levels of WIH and, upon occasion, HIW (Fox & \nDwyer, 1999; Major, Klein, & Ehrhart, 2002).   \nWork-home culture is another situational element of the workplace that has been shown \nto affect employee levels of work-home interference. It is defined as the shared assumptions, \nbeliefs and values regarding the extent to which an organization supports and values the \nintegration of employees\u2019 work and personal lives (Thompson et al., 1999). Three components \nof work-home culture can be identified in the literature: organizational time demands, or \nexpectations that employees prioritize work over family or personal responsibilities; potential \nnegative career consequences associated with devoting time to family or personal \nresponsibilities; and managerial support of employees\u2019 family or personal responsibilities.  \nResearch indicates that these aspects of an organization\u2019s culture can contribute to the \nexperience of interference between work and home. An organizational climate favouring the \nprioritization of work over family and the sacrificing of family to work has been shown to \nincrease levels of both WIH and HIW among employees (Kossek, Colquitt, & Noe, 2001). \nIncreased levels of WIH have also been reported by employees who perceive a link between \nspending time on home responsibilities and suffering negative career repercussions (Anderson, \nCoffey, & Byerly, 2002; Thompson et al., 1999). \nIn contrast, the presence of supervisors who express support for employees attempting \n   \n \n \n11 \n \nto balance work and home has consistently demonstrated a negative effect on employee levels \nof work-home interference (Erdwins et al., 2001; Thomas and Ganster, 1995). Employees who \nperceive their organization\u2019s culture to be supportive of them have reported lower levels of \ngeneralized work-home interference (Allen, 2001), WIH (Kirchmeyer & Cohen, 1999; \nThompson et al., 1999), and HIW (Friedman & Greenhaus, 2000).  \nHypothesis 5: Presence of dependant children and hours worked will be positively \nrelated to WIH and HIW.  \nHypothesis 6: Organizational time demands and potential negative career consequences \nwill be positively related to WIH and HIW; managerial support will be negatively \nrelated to WIH and HIW. \nMethod \nSample  \nParticipants were drawn from two organizations in England: a local government \ncouncil and a higher-education institution. Surveys were mailed out to all 300 employees of the \nlocal authority, and to all 486 employees of the higher-education institute. Two hundred and \nthirty-one surveys were returned, yielding a response rate of 29%. Eight surveys were excluded \nfrom the final analyses due to missing responses, generating an effective sample size of 223.  \nThe majority of respondents were women (62.3%). Participant ages ranged from 17 to \n68, with an average age of just over 41 years. One hundred and seventy-eight respondents \n(79.8%) reported living with a spouse or partner, and of these, 82.8% were members of \ndual-earner households, where the spouse or partner was also employed. One hundred and \nforty-one (63.2%) respondents reported having children, with the average age of the youngest \nchild just over 14 years, and 33 (14.8%) respondents reported having caregiving \nresponsibilities for adult dependents. The average number of adult dependents for these \nrespondents was 1.33.  \n   \n \n \n12 \n \nMeasures \nWork-home interference. Work-home interference was measured with the 18 items \nfrom Carlson, Kacmar, & Williams\u2019 (2000) multidimensional measure of work-family conflict. \nAll items were modified in order to be applicable to respondents both with and without family \nresponsibilities. For example, \u201cThe behaviours I perform that make me effective at work do not \nhelp me to be a better parent and spouse\u201d was modified to read, \u201cThe behaviours I perform that \nmake me effective at work do not help me to be a better partner, friend, or parent\u201d. Participants \nwere asked to indicate the extent to which they agree or disagree with the items on a \nseven-point scale ranging from \u201cstrongly disagree\u201d = 1 to \u201cstrongly agree\u201d = 7. \nFactor analysis revealed that the three items from the time-based work interference with \nhome subscale and the three items from the strain-based work interference with home subscale \nloaded on just one factor. The two subscales were therefore combined to form one scale, \nhenceforth called \u201cWork interference with home\u201d. In addition, the three items from the \ntime-based home interference with work subscale and the three items from the strain-based \nhome interference with work subscale loaded onto one factor; they were merged to produce one \nscale \u2013 \u201cHome interference with work\u201d - for the current study.  \nFactor analysis also revealed that the three items measuring behaviour-based work \ninterference with home loaded on the same factor as the three items assessing behaviour-based \nhome interference with work. Respondents of the survey evidently did not discriminate \nbetween the two possible directions of interference, indicating that when work behaviours are \nperceived as being ineffective or inappropriate in the home domain, home behaviours are also \ndeemed unsuitable for the work domain, and vice versa. Because a composite, non-directional \nbehaviour-based work-home interference scale does not permit meaningful interpretation of \nresults, the behaviour-based dimension was dropped from the measure.  \nThe factoring method used for all scales was principal axis. Ford, MacCallum, and Tait \n   \n \n \n13 \n \n(1986) recommend this common factoring method in place of the principal components \nmethod of analysis, which mixes common, specific, and random error variances. Varimax \northogonal rotation was used for all scales in accordance with Hinkin\u2019s (1998) \nrecommendation, as the intent was to develop scales that were reasonably independent of one \nanother. \nThe reliability alphas were .92 for the time- and strain-based WIH scale, and .85 for \ntime- and strain-based HIW.  \n Adaptive perfectionism. Adaptive perfectionism was measured with the adaptive \nperfectionism subscale of Slaney, Mobley, Trippi, Ashby, and Johnson\u2019s (1996) revised \nAlmost Perfect Scale. This scale has been subject to assessments of construct and content \nvalidity, both of which have been supported (see Slaney et al., 2001 for details). Seven items \nassessed the extent to which respondents perceived a low level of distress resulting from the \ndiscrepancy between their personal standards and their performance (e.g., \u201cI expect the best \nfrom myself\u201d). The same seven-point Likert response scale was used. In order to establish the \nconceptual distinctiveness of the scales measuring dispositional characteristics, items \nmeasuring perfectionism, self-efficacy, and self-esteem were all included in the factor analysis. \nOne item was dropped from the adaptive perfectionism scale after factor analysis (\u201cIf you don\u2019t \nexpect much out of yourself, you will never succeed\u201d) as its factor loading was less than .40. \nThe reliability alpha for this scale was .89.  \n Maladaptive perfectionism. Maladaptive perfectionism was measured with the \nmaladaptive perfectionism subscale of Slaney et al.\u2019s (1996) revised Almost Perfect Scale. \nSeven items assessed the extent to which respondents perceived a high level of distress \nresulting from the discrepancy between their personal standards and their performance (e.g., \u201cI \nhardly ever feel that what I\u2019ve done is good enough\u201d). The same seven-point Likert response \nscale was used. Cronbach\u2019s alpha for this scale was .93.  \n   \n \n \n14 \n \n Self-efficacy. General self-efficacy was measured with Chen, Gully and Eden\u2019s (2001) \nNew General Self-Efficacy scale, which yielded high levels of content and predictive validity \nwhen assessed (see Chen et al., 2001). Eight items assessed the extent to which respondents \nperceived that they were able to successfully perform tasks in a variety of achievement \nsituations (e.g., \u201cIn general, I think that I can obtain outcomes that are important to me\u201d). The \nsame seven-point Likert response scale was used. Cronbach\u2019s alpha for this scale was .90. \nSelf-esteem. Global self-esteem was measured using Rosenberg\u2019s (1965) scale. Ten \nitems assessed respondents\u2019 perception of their overall worth (e.g., \u201cI feel that I have a number \nof good qualities\u201d). Items were answered using the same seven-point Likert scale. The \nreliability alpha for this scale was .86. \n Work-home culture. Organizational work-home culture was measured using Thompson \net al.\u2019s (1999) scale. Fifteen items assessed the extent to which respondents perceived \norganizational time demands for prioritizing work over home, that personal or family \nresponsibilities had the potential to generate negative career consequences, and that managerial \nsupport existed for work-home issues. Two items were dropped from the potential negative \ncareer consequences subscale following factor analysis, as both loaded highly on more than one \nfactor (\u201cTo turn down a promotion for personal or family-related reasons will seriously hurt \none\u2019s career progress in this organization\u201d; \u201cIn this organization, employees who work \npart-time are viewed as less serious about their career than those who work full-time\u201d). \nReliability alphas were .94 for organizational time demands, .77 for potential negative career \nconsequences, and .91 for managerial support.  \nAnalysis \n Hierarchical regression analysis was used to test the hypotheses. The two forms of \nwork-home interference \u2013 work interference with home and home interference with work \u2013 \nwere individually regressed on the measures of adaptive perfectionism, maladaptive \n   \n \n \n15 \n \nperfectionism, self-efficacy, and self-esteem. For each equation, the control variables were \nentered in step 1, followed by the situational variables in step 2, and the dispositional variables \nin step 3 to determine whether or not they contributed over and above the effects of situational \ncharacteristics.  \nIn each of the hierarchical regression equations, several background variables were \nincluded in the analyses for control purposes. The control variables included were organization \n(Council = 0\/College = 1, dummy-coded), age, and gender (male = 0\/female = 1, \ndummy-coded). In previous research, these demographic variables have been established as \nimportant explanatory variables in their own right in terms of work-home interference. For \ninstance, women have often reported more WIH and HIW than have men (Saltzstein et al., \n2001), while age has been shown to have a negative relationship with WHI (Grandey & \nCropanzano, 1999). The type of organization has also been linked to work-home interference; \nCarnicer et al. (2004) found that government employees were less likely to experience \ninterference than were those in the private sector. In order to focus on the main research \nquestions that this study was designed to assess, however, these variables were used and treated \nsimply as control variables in the regression equations.  \nA usefulness analysis (Darlington, 1968) was conducted to reveal the unique \ncontribution of the dispositional variables in predicting the variance in work-home \ninterference. Usefulness analysis provides the incremental change in explained variance that is \nattributable to the set of independent variables that goes beyond the contribution to explained \nvariance of all the other variables in the equation. This analysis compares the change in R2 \nassociated with a set of independent variables while controlling for the effect of the other \nvariables in the equation. Each set of independent variables (dispositional and situational) was \nentered into a hierarchical equation in separate steps and in reverse ordering. For the usefulness \nanalysis, the dispositional variables were entered into the equation in a block rather than \n   \n \n \n16 \n \nindividually. This permits an examination of the variance in WHI explained by the set of \ndispositional variables in excess of the explanatory capacity of the set of situational variables, \nand vice versa.   \nResults \n The means, standard deviations, reliabilities and intercorrelations among the study \nvariables are reported in Table 1, while the results from the hierarchical multiple regression \nanalyses are presented in Tables 2 and 3.  \nTAKE IN TABLE I \n Hypothesis 1 was partially supported; adaptive perfectionism had a significant negative \nrelationship with HIW (\u03b2 = -.27, p < .001). Hypothesis 2 was strongly supported. Maladaptive \nperfectionism was positively and significantly related to WIH (\u03b2 = .14, p < .05), and HIW (\u03b2 = \n.22, p < .01). No support was found for Hypothesis 3, which predicted that self-efficacy would \nbe negatively related to work-home interference.  \nTAKE IN TABLE II \nTAKE IN TABLE III \n Hypothesis 4 received partial support; self-esteem had a significant negative \nrelationship with WIH (\u03b2 = -.13, p = .05). Hypothesis 5 also received partial support; the \npresence of dependant children in the household was positively and significantly related to both \nWIH (\u03b2 = .11, p < .05), and HIW (\u03b2 = .18, p < .01), and hours worked had a positive and \nsignificant relationship with WIH (\u03b2 = .21, p < .001). Hypothesis 6 was partially supported, \nwith organizational time demands displaying a significant positive relationship with WIH (\u03b2 = \n.51, p < .001), and a significant, negative relationship found between managerial support and \nWIH (\u03b2 = -.14, p < .05). \nTAKE IN TABLE IV \n   \n \n \n17 \n \nThe results of the usefulness analysis are displayed in Table 4. The dispositional \nvariables under investigation in this study accounted for significantly more variance beyond the \nsituational variables in HIW (\u0001R2  = .15, p < .001). Conversely, the situational variables under \nexamination accounted for significantly more variance beyond the dispositional variables in \nWIH (\u0001R2  = .38, p < .001).  \nDiscussion \n One of the aims of this study was to explore the effects of personality variables on \nemployee perceptions of work-home interference. The results of this investigation lend support \nto the theoretical work of Friede and Ryan (2005) and the empirical results of Bonebright et al. \n(2000), Carlson (1999), and Erdwins et al. (2001) in establishing that personality characteristics \nplay a role in determining to what degree an individual experiences interference between work \nand home. Consistent with Rothbard\u2019s (2001) premise that self-evaluations may influence \nwhether an individual perceives engagement in multiple roles as depleting or enriching, both \nadaptive and maladaptive perfectionism as well as self-esteem were found to have significant \neffects on work-home interference in the present study.  \nAs outlined earlier in this paper, Friede and Ryan (2005) proposed three ways in which \npersonality might affect the experience of work-home interference. Firstly, individuals may \nself-select into more challenging or supportive environments depending on their dispositional \ncharacteristics. Secondly, individuals may differ in their perceptions of work and home role \nrequirements as being either conflictual or enriching, depending on their personality. Finally, \nindividuals may choose different strategies to cope with work and home demands, based on \ntheir personality, which in turn may influence the degree of emotional strain experienced.  \nMaladaptive perfectionism, being associated with negative self-evaluations of \nperformance and increased sensitivity to stressors, corresponds most closely to pathway #2 in \nits relationship to work-home interference. In the current study, maladaptive perfectionism \n   \n \n \n18 \n \npredicted increased interference from work to home, and from home to work. The general \ntendency of maladaptive perfectionists to critically evaluate their performance (Frost et al., \n1990) renders them prone to making negative evaluations of their efforts to achieve low levels \nof work-home interference. Also responsible may be the tendency of maladaptive perfectionists \nto be more negatively affected by life stressors than individuals low in maladaptive \nperfectionism (Mitchelson & Burns, 1998). While not measured in this study, the propensity \nfor procrastination often displayed by maladaptive perfectionists (Johnson & Slaney, 1996) \ncould also play a role in explaining their elevated levels of interference, by contributing to time \npressures and consequent strain.  \nAdaptive perfectionism, in contrast, is associated with increased effort and persistence \n(LoCicero & Ashby, 2000), behaviours that may represent an effective way of coping with \nconflicting work and home demands. The negative relationship between adaptive \nperfectionism and HIW found in the present study therefore corresponds most closely to \npathway #3 in Friede and Ryan\u2019s (2005) model of personality\u2019s influence on work and home \nrole engagement, which proposes that personality may influence the strategies selected to \napproach the work-home interface.  \nThe failure of adaptive perfectionism to predict WIH may be attributable to the greater \npermeability of the home domain; dispositional characteristics are believed to have the greatest \neffect on behaviour when the situation is relevant to the personality trait\u2019s expression, and is \nweak enough to allow an individual to choose how to behave in that situation (Stewart & \nBarrick, 2004). When seeking to manage demands from both work and home, accommodations \ncan more often be made at home (Eagle, Miles, & Icenogle, 1997). When adaptive \nperfectionists initiate efforts to achieve their high standards for reduced interference between \nwork and home, these efforts may be more successful in an environment where there is more \n   \n \n \n19 \n \nscope to adjust one\u2019s behaviour. Adaptive perfectionism may be less effective in the less \nmalleable environment of the workplace, leading to a non-significant impact on WIH.  \nLike adaptive perfectionism, self-esteem is also associated with greater effort and \npersistence (McFarlin et al., 1984), corresponding to pathway #3 of Friede and Ryan\u2019s (2005) \nmodel in its relationship to work-home interference. Individuals with higher levels of \nself-esteem are also more likely to make positive evaluations of work and home situations, \nhowever (Kinnier et al., 1991). This corresponds to pathway #2, in which personality \ninfluences individuals\u2019 perceptions of work and home role requirements (Friede & Ryan, \n2005).  \nGiven the greater permeability of the home domain discussed above, it is curious that \nself-esteem was a predictor only of reduced WIH in the present study. There would appear to \nbe no straightforward rationale for why self-esteem would influence an individual\u2019s coping \nstrategies for WIH but not HIW, or affect an employee\u2019s perceptions of work role requirements \nbut not home role demands. According to Morf (1989), individual dispositions would lead an \nindividual to respond similarly to work and to home; the expectation is that the behaviour \nresulting from these dispositions would be similar in both domains. The standardized beta \ncoefficient for self-esteem in the HIW analysis was in fact slightly higher than that in the WIH \nregression equation, but it came under the threshold for statistical significance. Either there is \nan as-yet undiscovered reason for why self-esteem might act as a buffer against WIH only, or \nthis finding is a statistical anomaly peculiar to this one study. In either case, further research is \nwarranted.  \nConsistent with previous research (Allen, 2001; Kossek et al., 2001), elements of \nwork-home culture were found to have significant direct effects upon WIH. High levels of WIH \nwere reported by employees experiencing strong organizational time demands and little \nmanagerial support. Feeling pressure to work long hours and assign priority to one\u2019s job rather \n   \n \n \n20 \n \nthan one\u2019s home life contributed significantly to the spillover of work demands into the home \ndomain, by increasing time pressures for those complying with organizational time demands, \nand potentially generating stress among those failing to fulfill such demands. The increased \nWIH experienced by employees receiving little support from immediate or upper management \nmay be attributable to the failure of those managers to provide either instrumental support in \nthe form of flexibility within employees\u2019 work schedules, and\/or emotional support with regard \nto work-home concerns. Work-home culture had no significant effects upon HIW, providing \nsupport for the prevailing conceptualization of HIW as being caused by demographic \ncharacteristics and stressors originating in the home domain.  \nThe second aim of this study was to explore whether the dispositional or the situational \ncharacteristics under investigation were responsible for explaining the greatest amount of \nvariance in work-home interference. The results of the usefulness analysis suggest that while \nthe situational variables under study explained more variance in WIH than did the dispositional \ncharacteristics, the opposite was true for HIW. These findings provide additional support for \nthe notion of separate antecedents to WIH and HIW. Situational characteristics primarily \nassociated with the work domain accounted for the majority of variance in WIH, while \npersonality traits were responsible for explaining virtually all of the variance in HIW. This may \nbe due to the interpersonal nature of many of the stressors contributing to HIW, the perception \nof which may be more influenced by an individual\u2019s personality characteristics. These results \nraise the possibility that HIW may be more strongly tied to the individual occupying \nhome-related roles than to the roles themselves. The opposite may be true of WIH; interference \nfrom work to the home domain may arise predominantly due to factors associated with the \nwork role, rather than the worker. This would help to explain the dissimilar influence of \ndispositional variables on the two directions of work-home interference. Of course, it must be \nremembered that only small subsets of all possible situational and dispositional variables were \n   \n \n \n21 \n \nconsidered in this study. Overall, however, the findings indicate that models of work-home \ninterference containing only situation or person-based predictors risk underspecification; \nincluding both situation and person-based explanations results in a more complete prediction \nmodel of work-home interference.  \nImplications for Managers \n In terms of the practical implications of these findings, it is important that neither \npolicy-makers nor managers view the resolution of work-home interference as an individual \nresponsibility due to the demonstrated influence of individual differences on the presence or \nabsence of such interference. Lewis, Rapoport and Gambles (2003) argue that questions \nregarding the fundamental changes necessary for effective work-life integration need to be \naddressed at all levels of society. Working to reduce interference between work and home must \nremain a joint activity, with organizations, governments, and individual employees sharing \naccountability and responsibility for generating solutions. A climate of individualism in the \nwork-home arena is not helpful. \nFrom an organizational point of view, employees are unlikely to be selected on the basis \nof their predeliction for adaptive or maladaptive perfectionism, or self-esteem. It is equally \nunlikely that personality characteristics such as these can be encouraged or discouraged via \nconventional training procedures, given that these types of traits are considered relatively stable \nself-concepts (Gardner & Pierce, 1998). Raising managerial awareness of the influence of \npersonality traits upon the experience of work-home interference may prove useful. It is well \ndocumented that managerial support of work-home issues is associated with lower levels of \nemployee work-home interference (Thomas & Ganster, 1995). A manager aware of, for \nexample, the distress caused by a mismatch between an employee\u2019s performance and personal \nstandards may provide more effective support than one who assumes work-home interference \nis attributable only to situational characteristics such as work hours or demands from home. \n   \n \n \n22 \n \nEncouragement, reassurance, and sharing of personal experience with subordinates may \nprovide a useful supplement to instrumental support activities such as arranging flexible \nworking practices for affected employees.  \nLimitations and Future Research \n Some limitations to the present study should be noted. Because the data were collected \nthrough the use of a single survey at a single point in time, the results may be influenced by \ncommon method bias. Moreover, the cross-sectional design of the study does not allow for firm \nconclusions regarding causality. It is conceivable that an employee experiencing high levels of \nwork-home interference may evaluate himself or herself more negatively as a result, reporting \nlower levels of self-efficacy and self-esteem. Future research employing a longitudinal design \nwould be better placed to assess issues of directionality.   \nAnother limitation of the research was the failure of the multidimensional work-home \ninterference measure to separate into its discrete time-based and strain-based components \nduring factor analysis. While this is by no means an isolated incident in the work-home \nliterature, it may signal a weakness either of the measurement instrument, or the \nconceptualization of work-home interference. Items measuring time-based interference and \nitems measuring strain-based interference often load on the same factor (e.g., Geurts, Kompier, \nRoxburgh, & Houtman, 2003), and previous researchers have sometimes found that their \nmeasures of time-based and strain-based interference were highly correlated, indicating \nsignificant overlap between the two, and have therefore combined the two scales to form a \nsingle composite measure of overall time- and strain-based interference (e.g., Parasuraman, \nGreenhaus, & Granrose, 1992; Parasuraman & Simmers, 2001). It has been suggested by \nThompson and Beauvais (2000) that strong correlations between time-based and strain-based \ninterference occur because strain is often a result of time demands. If this is indeed the case, the \nconceptualization of time-based interference and strain-based interference as independent \n   \n \n \n23 \n \nforms of interference may need to be re-evaluated, and the possibility that time-based \ninterference is an antecedent to strain-based interference considered. \nBecause behaviour-based work-home interference is so rarely examined in the \nwork-home literature, it is difficult to ascertain whether the failure of the behaviour-based \nmeasure to divide into its two directional components signifies a fault with the measurement \ninstrument, or whether some underlying flaw in the conceptualization of behaviour-based \ninterference is responsible. Exploratory, qualitative research seeking to determine what exactly \nbehaviour-based interference entails would be invaluable in developing a more comprehensive \nunderlying theory of the construct and enabling future researchers to investigate its antecedents \nand outcomes with greater success. \n More total variance was explained for WIH than for HIW. This may be due to the focus \nof this study on work-oriented variables; other than demographic characteristics and the \npresence of dependant children, no factors originating in the home domain were taken into \naccount which might have further explained HIW. Future research should include more \ndetailed assessments of home demands in order to more accurately evaluate the power of \ndispositional over situational characteristics in explaining variance in HIW.  \n   \n \n \n24 \n \nReferences \n \nAllen, T.
