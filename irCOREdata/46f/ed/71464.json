Introduction\nRecently, significant growth has been observed in the size and\ncomplexity of the technological installations in the automotive,\npower, chemical and food industries [9]. A side effect of\nthis growth is an increase in the concentration of measuring,\nprocessing and control devices. The likelihood of appearance\nof a fault that may lead to the breakdown of a component, or the\nwhole system, increases with the complexity of the system [8].\nTo tackle this problem, as well as to address the increasingly\nrestrictive safety and environmental regulations, a significant\nrise in the demands on automatic fault detection, isolation\nand correction (FDIC) algorithms has been observed [18, 9].\nThese systems are required to cope with large dimensionality\n0957-0233\/06\/071809+10$30.00 \u00a9 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd Printed in the UK 1809\nP Angelov et al\nFigure 1. FDIC scheme in an on-line measurement and plausibility check system.\nof the measured process variables, high sampling rates, non-\nstationary patterns, false alarms etc. The automation of\ndiagnostic operations makes it possible to significantly shorten\nthe time of identification and isolation of potential breakdowns,\nwhich has economic implications.\nIt is useful to formally define the fault of a system.\nThe International Federation for Automatic Control, IFAC,\nhas issued by one of its technical committees the following\ndefinition, which will be adopted in our paper [1]:\nFault is an unpermitted deviation of at least one\ncharacteristic property or variable of the system from\nits acceptable\/usual\/standard behaviour.\nIn fact, a fault is caused by wrong behaviour of the system,\nwhich can even be a serious danger for human beings, e.g. a\nbroken pipe where gas effuses. In this sense, an early detection\nof faults is indispensable. In this paper, the key assumption\nis that most of the faults, and especially all significant faults,\nare reflected in the (on-line recorded) measurement data as\nuntypical patterns, jumps, drifts etc. Hereby, the following\nthree phases are considered:\n\u2022 Fault detection (FD): concerns the detection and warning\nof fault presence.\n\u2022 Fault isolation (FI): concerns the identification of the place\nof fault appearance.\n\u2022 Fault correction (FC): concerns the automatic correction\nof faults (in the measurement data).\nThe main focus is mainly on FD as this phase is the most\nimportant one which is a prerequisite for the other two.\nThe proposed new concepts of automatic fault isolation and\nautomatic fault correction (i.e. delivering correct measurement\nvalues) are also introduced.\nThere is a considerable body of literature concerning\nfault detection, isolation and correction (FDIC) in industrial\nmeasurement systems [8, 9, 12, 14, 18]. The approaches can\nbe loosely divided into the following:\n(i) Classification based.\n(ii) Hypothesis testing.\n(iii) Model based.\n(iv) Signal processing based.\nThe classification-based approaches use techniques such as\nprincipal component analysis (PCA), Fisher discriminant\nanalysis (FDA), and work normally off-line (based on a batch\nset of data collected from the industrial system) [9]. The\nsecond group relies on statistical tests of hypotheses about the\nstructure of the model. In [26] such an approach is combined\nwith propositional logic. It has close links with the group\nof model-based approaches. Model-based approaches are\nperhaps the most popular type. They are based on the idea\nof a model that represents the ideal, fault-free process and the\ncomparison of the real measurement with the reference model.\nThe resulting deviations (residuals) can then be observed (in\noff-line or on-line mode) and used to trigger a fault detection\nmechanism [8, 29]. Different types of models (regression\nand correlation models [28], fuzzy models [7, 19], causal-\nbased models [15] or first principle models [18]) are used\nin different publications. However, thresholds are usually\nselected manually and residual calculations are very specific\n[19, 28]. Signal processing and filtering techniques are used,\nfor example, in so-called intelligent sensors [2], to detect\nsensor faults such as peaks, (mean) drifts or other anomalies\n[22] in both time and frequency domains.\nIn this paper, a generic framework for combined FDIC\nis proposed that is suitable for both on-line and off-line\napplications, including real-time. This is based on the results\npresented in [14, 24]. The proposed approach is model based\nand classification based. The basic structure of the proposed\nmethodology is graphically presented in figure 1.\nThe approach combines on-line adaptation and evolution\nof the reference model, which can be built based on the\n1810\nAn approach to model-based fault detection in industrial measurement systems\nexperimental\/operational data. The on-line nature and the\nability to detect faults as early as possible are the key features\nof the proposed new approach. As an additional option fault\npatterns can be used to train the data-driven model to help the\nprocess of fault correction (dotted line in figure 1).\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In\nsection 2 the goals of the FDIC problem are formally stated.\nThe role of reference models is discussed in section 3.1. The\nproposed approach for FDIC is presented in section 4. The\nevaluation methodology and results are presented in section 5.\nSection 6 concludes the paper and outlines directions for\nfurther work.\n2. Problem statement\nLet x1, x2, . . . , xn be n-independent measurement variables\nin an arbitrary industrial process recorded dynamically with\ncertain frequency (time steps). Then, a general static model\nfor a specific variable xi at time instant k can be defined as\nx\u02c6i = fk(xj 1, . . . , xj n), jm \u2208 {1, . . . , n}\\{i}. (1)\nIf we take the time component into account, equation (1) can\nbe detailed as\nx\u02c6i = fk(xj 1(k), xj 1(k \u2212 1), . . . , xj 1(k \u2212 l), . . . , xj n(k),\n\u00d7 xj n(k \u2212 1), . . . , xj n(k \u2212 l),\n\u00d7 xi(k \u2212 1), xi(k \u2212 2), . . . , xi(k \u2212 l))\njm \u2208 {1, . . . , n}\\{i}. (2)\nThe constant l defines the order of the model. In both cases a\ndependence between xi and a subset of the other measurement\nvariables in the system is described by a model fk at time\ninstant k. When the model fk is based on first principles, it\nrepresents an analytical formula where all the parameters are\nknown and set a priori and fk = fk+m for all m \u2208 N. That\nmeans the parameters of the model, and hence the model itself,\ndo not change with time.\nIn the alternative data-driven approach the parameters of\nthe model fk are estimated based on data alone [3]. The data\nmay be collected historically, by simulation of the considered\nprocess, or in on-line mode. When new recorded data \u0002xk+m are\ncollected the model parameters are adjusted, and, moreover,\nthe model structure may also be adapted\/evolved [3], such\nthat fk \u0003= fk+m for some m \u2208 N. With this notation, the goal\nof a fault detection (FD) strategy can be formulated in the\nfollowing way:\nGoal 1. Let f1,k, . . . , fm,k be m various models as defined\nby equations (1) or (2) describing some relationships between\ndifferent variables of an industrial process at time instant k.\nThen n newly recorded measurements \u0002xk+1,...,k+n (\u0002xk denotes\nthe row vector containing the kth measurement values for all\nvariables) should be classified using these models as reference,\nsuch that the number of correct classifications should be as\nhigh as possible.\nIf only two classes are considered (one class representing the\nfault-free case and the other representing all possible faulty\ncases) the correct classifications can be split into correct\ndetections of faults and into correct detection of no faults, both\ninfluencing the detection rate and false detection rate. This\ndistinction is made, because the detection and false detection\nrates play different roles with different priorities. The ideal\ncase would be 100% detection rate and 0% false detection\nrate, which can usually only be achieved with noise-free data\nand perfect models. Usually, the false detection rate is more\nimportant than the detection rate, as in the case of a high false\ndetection rate the operator gets easily irritated and confidence\nin the system falls.\nThe goal of the fault isolation strategy can be defined in\nthe following way [12]:\nGoal 2. Let \u0002xk+i , i \u2208 {1, . . . , l}, l < m, represent l faulty\nmeasurements out of n measurements in total; then the goal\nof the fault isolation strategy is to keep the number of correct\nisolations as high as possible.\nSimilarly to goal 1, the number of correct isolations\ncan be divided into (correct) isolations of faulty channels\nand into (correct) non-isolations of non-faulty channels, both\ninfluencing the false isolation rate [12]. As fault isolation is\ntriggered by FD, it is obvious that the performance of the fault\nisolation with respect to correctly found faulty channels can\nbe only as good as the FD method itself. In goal 2 the focus is\nkept only on one part of fault isolation, namely the detection\nof the measured and calculated channels affected by the fault.\nIt should be noted that the time instant when the fault appears\nis usually known and registered (both in off-line and on-line\nmodes of data collection).\nThe goal of the fault correction can be defined as follows:\nGoal 3. Let \u0002xk+i , i \u2208 {1, . . . , l}, l < m be the l faulty\nmeasurements and let xj,k+i , j \u2208 {1, . . . , o} be the faulty value\nin channel j of measurement k + i; then the goal of fault\ncorrection is to correct the faulty values such that\nE =\nl\u2211\ni=1\np\u2211\nj=1\n|xj,k+i (corr) \u2212 xj,k+i (fault-free)| \u2192 min (3)\nis as small as possible, i.e. the deviation of the corrected values\nfrom the real fault-free values is minimal.\nHere the performance of fault correction depends strongly\non both the performance of FD and the performance of fault\nisolation. The question arises whether it is possible to obtain\nthe real fault-free values. Quite often during the testing and\nvalidation phase artificial errors are included although the real\nvalues are known. Ideally, the FD approach should detect all\nfailures affecting any of the measurement channels included\nin the f1,k, . . . , fm,k set of models. This covers all kinds of\nfaults in the measurement system, and those system faults that\naffect the measured variables.\n3. Models as reference situation\nEquations (1) and (2) correspond to general models, where an\nestimate x\u02c6i is provided for measurement channel xi on the basis\nof the measured values of other channels at the same instant or\nat previous instants. These models can be modified to include\ninequalities (\u3008,\u3009). In this case, instead of a direct estimation\nof the limits, measured values are provided. According to the\nnature of the model, they can be classified into several groups:\nanalytical models, knowledge-based, data-driven models or\nhybrid models.\n1811\nP Angelov et al\n3.1. Analytical models\nAnalytical (also known as first principle) models are functional\nrelationships resulting from a theoretical analysis of the\nconsidered phenomenon based on the laws of physics,\nchemistry, biology etc. For example, mass balance, energy\nbalance and conservation of momentum are often used to\nbuild up analytical models for both open and closed systems.\nMany analytical models refer to transient processes and take\nthe form of integral or differential equations; their use for\nFD purposes is complex and they are not suitable for the\nFDIC approach described in this paper. Conversely, analytical\nmodels referring to steady-state processes, expressed in the\nform of formulae\/equations, are suitable for FDIC purposes.\nThey have the advantage that their parameters have clear\nmeaning and can remain static. For this type of model there\nis no need for experimental data to build or tune the model.\nTheir main drawback is the requirement of extensive physical\nknowledge of the system, since their reliability depends on\nthe correct identification of the variables that influence the\nphenomenon.\nAn example of a steady-state analytical model in an engine\ntest bench system is the formula for the calculation of air inlet\nvolumetric flow of the engine using a measuring sharp-edged\norifice. In this case, the air flow rate (as the target channel)\nis expressed as a function of the input channel\u2019s air pressure,\nPair, and temperature, Tair, and the pressure drop, \u0001P , through\nthe orifice:\nQ = f (Pair, Tair,\u0001P ). (4)\n3.2. Knowledge-based models\nKnowledge-based models are created from linguistic expert\nknowledge: knowledge expressed in the form of linguistic\nrules. This collection of rules is coded into binary or fuzzy\nrule bases triggering decision trees [6, 11] or complete fuzzy\nsystems [25, 27]. From this point of view, they are built\nonce and remain static for the whole application process\nin a similar way as for analytical models. As opposed\nto analytical models, they benefit from being applicable to\nvery complex relationships within the system which cannot\nbe described by an analytical model. They allow a good\ninsight into some system behaviour for non-experts since\nlinguistic rules are easily readable by humans. However, the\ndrawback of a high development effort still remains, as expert\nknowledge is usually collected through extensive meetings\nand discussions. Additional drawbacks are that sometimes\nthe expert knowledge is not enough to explain extraordinary\nsystem states or when the experts have contradictory opinions.\nIn the literature knowledge-based models are also called weak\nwhite box models. As they are not included in the current\nFDIC framework, they will not be considered in this paper.\n3.3. Data-driven models\nData-driven models are generated from data alone without\nany prior knowledge or assumptions about the physical\nattributes and meanings of the measurement channels [4]. This\ngeneration process is also called training or learning. Data can\nbe available in the form of batch (off-line collected and pre-\nrecorded) data sets, most commonly stored in data matrices;\nor in the form of on-line measurements, which are recorded\nduring the process operation. If the latter is the case the\nmodels should be kept up to date (usually with incremental\nlearning techniques), especially when tracking highly time-\nvariant system behaviour (figure 1). Data-driven models can\nbe built up generically in the sense that no underlying physical,\nchemical or other laws about the measurement variables must\nbe known. This produces the generic usability of such methods\nfor any industrial system under the assumption that there exist\nobserved or recorded measurements. However, faults in the\ndata set can erode the trained models such that they lead\nto incorrect approximation results. This drawback can be\navoided using feedback rejection as shown in figure 1. In this\nway, only those data points which are classified as fault-free\n[22], are incorporated into the model building process. In the\nproposed FDIC framework two kinds of data-driven models\nwere applied:\n\u2022 Linear correlation and regression models.\n\u2022 Fuzzy models extracted from data.\nBoth types can be developed by batch learning or in\nan incremental (on-line) manner. While correlation and\nregression models [16] possess only linear parameters and\ntherefore have a reduced flexibility, fuzzy models, especially\nTakagi\u2013Sugeno fuzzy models, can approximate an arbitrary\nfunction to any degree of accuracy [30]. Such models are thus\nfeasible choices for modelling nonlinear dependences between\nvariables. Fuzzy models are preferable compared to neural\nnetworks because of their transparency and the interpretability\nof the underlying relationships [3]. Various methods exist in\nthe literature for training fuzzy models in the batch learning\nmode [3, 10, 17]. For on-line (incremental) learning of fuzzy\nmodels refer to [5, 21, 23]. In [21] special attention is paid to\nthe bias errors for specific types of fuzzy models, which will\nbe an essential point in the FD approach presented in section\n4. This type of method will be called fuzzy for the remainder\nof this paper.\n3.4. Hybrid models\nOften the considered steady process involves many variables\nwhich are not necessarily independent. Very often the average\nvalue of steady variables is influenced by transient phenomena.\nIn these cases, theoretical analysis or empirical knowledge is\nuseful in the identification of which variables or groups of\nvariables are important. The functional structure can also be\ndetermined, but not the parameters. In this case, data-driven\nparameter identification using a reference database is a helpful\naddition to the analytical or empirical prior knowledge. The\nmodels obtained by this procedure are classified as hybrid\nmodels. In section 5 an example of this type of hybrid model\nwill be demonstrated together with the applied identification\nstrategy.\n4. Fault detection isolation and correction approach\n4.1. FD approach for models of equalities type\nOne obvious FD approach, when using models based on\nequalities with a unique target measurement variable as the\nfault-free reference situation, is to generate m residuals from m\n1812\nAn approach to model-based fault detection in industrial measurement systems\nmodels for the current measurement (say the kth) by comparing\nthe measured value with the values of the target variables\nestimated by these models\nresk,m = \u2016x\u02c6k,m \u2212 xk,m\u2016 (5)\nwhere x\u02c6k,m is the estimated value of the mth model using the kth\nmeasurement. This residual can be compared to a percentage\nthreshold on the relative deviation of the measured value from\nthe expected value of the model,\n\u2016x\u02c6k,m \u2212 xk,m\u2016\nx\u02c6k,m\n> perc thresh (6)\nwhere perc thresh \u0001 0 can be tuned according to the precision\nrequirements of the FD framework. The threshold is easily\ninterpretable for an operator. As the threshold approaches\n0 the risk of false detections becomes higher, whereas faults\nwith lower intensities can be detected. From this point of view,\nthere is always a trade-off between achieving high detection\nrates and low false detection rates.\nThe previous formula denotes the condition for a fault.\nIt is only valid in the case of perfect models and noise-free\ndata, otherwise bias and variance errors have to be integrated\ninto the fault condition in order to obtain correct and stable\nresults. Moreover, in the case when x\u02c6k,m < \u0002 with \u0002 near\nzero, the above formula becomes unstable. The bias error is\npart of the whole model error (also called expected prediction\nerror) which stems from the inflexibility of a model when\nreproducing a nonlinear process, e.g. in the case that the\nmodel has too low parameters or does not have an appropriate\nstructure or appropriate inputs. The variance error is the part\nof the expected prediction error which is due to noise in the\ndata and therefore yields uncertainty in the parameters of the\ngenerated model.\nDifferent levels of sensor inaccuracies can appear for\ndifferent variables and also in different measurement systems.\nThus, in order to guarantee automatic threshold determination\nand improve the correctness of FD statements, both the bias\nand the variance errors are incorporated into the estimated\nvalues of models:\nx\u02c6k,m = fk,m \u00b1 model errorm\n= fk,m \u00b1\n\u221a\nbias error2m + var errorm. (7)\nObviously, in the case of a high bias error the variance\nerror can be neglected, while in the case of a low bias error\nthe variance error produces a significant contribution to the\nexpected prediction error which is important to avoid the well-\nknown overfitting effect for data-driven models [16]. For\nanalytical models, the variance error can be estimated by\napplying an error back-propagation law [1] (neglecting the\ntime component)\n\u03b5x\u02c6m =\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2202fm\u2202x1\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03b5x1 +\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2202fm\u2202x2\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03b5x2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 +\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2202fm\u2202xn\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03b5xn (8)\nwhich incorporates sensor inaccuracies in all input variables\nx1, . . . , xn contained in the model fm. The drawback of this\napproach lies with the indispensable a priori knowledge about\nsensor inaccuracies for all variables in a system, which is not\nalways available. However, whenever measurement data of the\nunderlying process are available, the expected prediction error\ncan be estimated by the addition of a term to the squared bias\nFigure 2.

Let us choose (without\nloss of generality) t to be a positive integer factor of\u221a\nbias error2m + var errorm, say thr; note that \u03b5y is always\npositive.

FD approach for inequalities-based models\nIn previous subsections, only models in the form of a set\nof equations (1) for a static model or (2) for a dynamic\nmodel have been considered. However, very often the expert\n1813\nP Angelov et al\nFigure 3. Best threshold value with respect to number of training\ndata points for building high-dimensional reference fuzzy models\nfor specific data sets.\nknowledge and analytical models can only be given in the form\nof inequalities. This happens frequently when the system\nis only known in a vague way and the available models are\ninaccurate. The proposed FD scheme is generally able to deal\nwith this class of relationships and only small modifications\nare required to take this into account. Let us assume that\nequation (1) becomes\nxm < fk(xj 1, . . . , xj n), jm \u2208 {1, . . . , n}\\{i} (12)\nwhere < is used without loss of generality. In this case,\nthe residual is considered to be equal to 0 if the inequality\nis satisfied and only the one-sided distribution is used in the\ndefinition of the fault condition. Thus substituting (11)\n\u2203m fm,k\u22121 \u2212 xm,k + \u03b5y\u221a\nbias error2m + var errorm\n< \u2212thr. (13)\n4.3. Adaptive thresholding in data-driven models\nThe estimation of the variance error as described in section 4.1\nis not always trustworthy, and sometimes even impossible to\ncalculate. An alternative is to have an adaptive threshold thr\non the right-hand side of the fault conditions (11) and (13). The\nthreshold value depends on the number of training data points\nin a monotonically decreasing way because of overfitting and\nhence an increase in the variance error is more likely with\na small number of data. This means the larger the number\nof data points fed into the training algorithm, the smaller the\nadaptive threshold gets. Ideally, it should ensure rates of\ndetection and false detection similar to when trained with the\nfull number of data points in a batch mode. Based on empirical\ntests with different data sets a functional dependence between\nthe number of training data points and the best value of the\nthreshold was extracted and was used for the car engine data\nsets shown later.\n4.4. Local model errors\nAn interesting aspect of the analysis of the data space for\npotential faults concerns local model errors. For a specific\nlocal region in the input\/output data space a separate model\nerror can be introduced in the denominator of the fault\ncondition (11) influencing the FD logic. This way a new\nincoming data sample is checked against the bias error of that\npart of the actual model which is nearest to this new point\n(with respect to some distance measure). It can be expected\nthat the detection rate increases, as the model error is usually\ndifferent for different regions (in some regions the model is\nmore accurate than in others). This was verified using FD\nbased on a fuzzy model where each separate rule denotes a\nspecific local region in the input\/output data space. It should\nbe noted, however, that for on-line FD this will inevitably lead\nto additional computational burden, which may be prohibitive\nin real-time applications.\n4.5. Consolidation of multiple FD outputs\nThe residuals calculated on the left-hand side of the inequality\ncan be normalized into error hint fuzzy values based on\ndifferent values of the monotonic transfer function as follows:\n\u2022 transfunc(0) = 0.\n\u2022 transfunc(thresh) = 0.5; in this case a value greater than\n0.5 is classified as fault.\n\u2022 transfunc(max res) = 1, where max res denotes the\nmaximal value of a residual.\n\u2022 transfunc is monotonic.\nThis normalization is indispensable considering that different\ncomponents in a system can interact and contribute to the\noverall plausibility and fault occurrence in a complex industrial\nsystem. The condition defined above can be applied in a\ngeneric way in all model-based FD modules. Special attention\nshould be paid to the threshold.\nFrom the aggregated error hint fuzzy value the unique\nerror hint crisp value is produced which yields a crisp FD\nstatement concerning the current measurement. This value is\nzero in the case of no fault in the actual measurement or 1 in\nthe case of fault in the actual measurement. Note that an error\nhint fuzzy value greater than 0.5 means fault. In addition to\nthese two values a third value is generated and used within the\nconsolidation process, the internal quality, which gives rise to\nthe trustworthiness of the models which were used as fault-\nfree references. One possible choice to calculate the internal\nquality is to evaluate the aggregated model quality and use\nthis as a measure of the internal quality. The quality of an\nanalytical or knowledge-based model can be determined using\nexpert knowledge. Alternatively, it can be evaluated based\non measurement data through the r-squared-adjusted formula.\nThis measure incorporates the degrees of freedom of a model\nand penalizes more complex models relative to easier ones.\nIt delivers values in the interval [0, 1], where a value near\n1 means that a very reliable model is available and a value\nfar below 1 suggests that the model is useless. This can be\nof essential help when generating data-driven models from a\nhigh-dimensional set of variables, where the input and output\nstructures of the models are not given and have to be estimated\nautomatically from data. Hence, models with a high quality\ncan be used in the FD framework while others are skipped.\nThe values produced by different plausibility check\nalgorithms, modelling and FD are combined directly together\nin a closed formula. In this sense, the direct consolidation\nmethod evaluates an overall plausibility statement for the\ncurrent measurements. The consolidation of partial FD\n1814\nAn approach to model-based fault detection in industrial measurement systems\nstatements can be based on different aggregation formulae\ncombining the error hint crisp values with the Boolean\noperators OR, AND, a democratic or soft decision combined\nwith the confidence values (=internal qualities) of all n FD\nmodules,\nIf\n\u2211\ni\u2208A\nint quali \u0001\n\u2211\ni\u2208B\nint quali\noverall error crisp = 1\n(14)\nElse\noverall error crisp = 0\nwhere A = {error crispi = 1|i = 1, 2, . . . , n} and B =\n{error crispi = 0|i = 1, 2, . . . , n}. In this case the\nconfidences of FD modules classifying a measurement as\nfaulty are compared with those of FD modules classifying\na measurement as fault-free. An error hint fuzzy value and\nan internal quality value are calculated that serve as overall\nfault likelihood measures. These two values are shown in the\noperator\u2019s GUI.\n4.6. Fault isolation\nFault isolation is triggered by the FD. Indeed, only in the case\nof a detected fault is it undertaken. The proposed fault isolation\napproach incorporates the output of the consolidation process\nin FD, namely the error hint fuzzy value and the internal quality\nvalue produced by each model for each separate measurement.\nAdditionally, the gradient information serves as an indicator of\nhow strongly a certain variable influences the model. Hence,\nin order to get comparable and range-independent influence\ninformation, normalized gradients are computed for each\nvariable in the actual point. The sensitivity vector introduced in\n[13] is upgraded with the gradient information and an estimate\nof the size of perturbation for a specific channel is derived using\nerror hint fuzzy and internal quality in order to classify this\nchannel as faulty (= to isolate the fault). From this estimation\na fault likelihood for each channel is calculated. It is in the\ninterval [\u22121, 1] (+1 for very likely, \u22121 for not likely; usually a\nthreshold value of zero was used in order to get a crisp decision\nfor each measurement channel). For further details see [12].\n4.7. Fault correction strategy\nThe fault correction strategy for delivering an expected value\ncan be summarized based on the information provided by\nthe reference model and using the proposed FD approach,\nconsolidating the results from each module and causing fault\nisolation statements as described in section 4.6, as follows:\n\u2022 If the faulty channel isolated using the fault isolation\nmodule is not a target channel (and hence only occurs\nas an input channel in at least one model and not on\nthe left-hand side as y of any model), then no corrected\nvalue can be delivered for this channel. This may happen\nwhen no useful functional relationship to at least one other\nmeasurement channel in the system exists for the isolated\nchannel which appears as target.\n\u2022 If the faulty channel isolated using the fault isolation\nmodule is a target channel in only one model, take the\nestimated value from this model (= the target value) and\ndeliver this as the corrected value.\n\u2022 If the faulty channel isolated by the fault isolation module\nis a target channel in more than one model, take the model\nwhich is the most trustworthy, i.e. with the highest model\nquality\u2014the other models for that channel can obviously\nbe considered obsolete for fault correction as they possess\na lower quality due to the less precise representation or\nlower flexibility (e.g., if input channels are missing etc).\nCombining the FD, the consolidated estimate, fault isolation\nand correction, the overall FDIC framework is summarized as\ngraphically presented in figure 1.\n5. Evaluation and results\n5.1. Measure values for evaluation\nIn order to be able to verify, validate, and compare the\nperformance of the model-based FDIC approach an objective\nbenchmark is needed. Using the labelled data (data sets\nmarked as faulty or error-free) one can define the detection\nrate using the relative frequency of detections as follows,\nAdet = NFD\nNFM\n, (15)\nwhere NFD denotes the number of measurements with a correct\ndetection and NFM denotes the number of faulty measurements\nin the test data set. The false detection rate can also be defined\nusing the labelled data and the relative frequency of false\ndetections, leading to\nAfalse = NFOD\nNFFM\n(16)\nwhere NFOD denotes the number of measurements with\nfalse detection and NFFM denotes the number of fault-free\nmeasurements in the test data set. A FD method that has\nboth high detection rate, Adet, and low false detection rate,\nAfalse, is preferable. For the cases when both detection rate,\nAdet, and false detection rate, Afalse, are high it is not obvious\nwhich method is preferable. For such cases, one can use\nthe following additional measure called external FD-method\nquality, or simply external quality, which combines detection\nrate and false detection rate in one value and incorporates the\nrelative frequency of faulty data in the test data set overall,\nextqual\n= wfalse(1 \u2212 Afalse) \u2212\nm\nn\n(wfalse(1 \u2212 Afalse) \u2212 wdetAdet)\n1.5 \u2212 m\nn\n,\n(17)\nwhere n is the number of the test data records, m is the number\nof faulty test data records, n\u2212m is the number of fault-free test\ndata records. The weights wfalse and wdet, both \u2208 [0, 2] with\nwfalse + wdet = 2, reflect the impact of the correct detections\nand false detections on the external quality measure. The\nweights can be adjusted in such a way that the importance of\ncorrect detections dominates the importance of false detections\nor vice versa.\n1815\nP Angelov et al\n5.2. Application example\nA real-world application example is used to demonstrate the\nviability of the proposed FDIC approach. The example is\nfrom the area of automotive engine test benches. This is\nan interesting industrial application which is characterized\nby high complexity, level of automation, and sophistication.\nThe verification and validation of correct detections and false\ndetections were carried out on data sets obtained through both\nsimulation and real-life tests of three different car engines:\n\u2022 Simulated engine data including noise-free data and faults\nwith an intensity of 5% and 10%.\n\u2022 Data set from a direct injection gasoline engine (Alfa\nRomeo JTS) including 19 channels and faults with\nintensities of 3%, 5%, 10%, 20% and 50%.\n\u2022 Real measured data for a heavy diesel engine (Caterpillar)\nfor real on-line check.\nFor the off-line tests, all data sets were divided into\na training data set for generating and adapting data-driven\n(regression and fuzzy rule-based) models and into testing data\nset. These test data sets include artificially built-in faulty\nmeasurements. In this sense, some good measurement values\nin the data sets were disturbed by a percentage of their absolute\nvalue. For example, a value of 100 was reset artificially to\na value 90, representing a (rather small) fault causing 10%\ndisturbance in the data. Hence, from now on we simply\nspeak about a fault level of 10% rather than a fault causing\n10% disturbance in the data. According to the experience\nreported by several engine test specialists (both engineers and\ntechnical staff interviewed in several engine manufacturing\ncompanies and research institutes), the usual critical failures\naffect the signal value in one or several measurement channels\nby more than 10%. Hence, fault levels of 20% and 50%\nwere selected for performance evaluation of our fault detection\napproach. Moreover, fault levels of 3%, 5% and 10% were\nalso selected in order to evaluate the performance on less\nsignificant faults (e.g., resulting from sensor aging or slightly\nincorrect positioning\/connection), which are harder to detect.\nIn this sense, the performance at these fault levels defines the\nachievable limits for the fault detection approach.\nFor the Caterpillar data no training data set was used for\noff-line tests. Instead the data were sent sample by sample in\nthe on-line mode. The model was built from the first 30 or\n50 data samples and tested based on the remaining data. In\naddition, the fault-free data after the 30th or 50th data sample\nwere used to adapt the model in the on-line mode. For all\ntest results, the direct consolidation strategy is used with the\n\u2018OR\u2019 type of aggregation operator. This has been confirmed\nby a large number of empirical experiments. This is logical,\nwhen taking into account that the main focus is laid on keeping\nthe false detection rate close to 0 for each FD module, since\notherwise the confidence in the proposed approach amongst\nthe human operators of the system would quickly diminish.\n5.3. Off-line results\n5.3.1. Results on simulated data. The first tests were carried\nout on simulated (thus noise-free) data for a special diesel\nengine together with two rated check data sets; one containing\nTable 1. Comparison results of model-based FD approach among\nseveral methods (= components) for simulated car engine data.\nMethod Fault level Adet Afalse extqual\nGlobal correlation 10% 20.47% 0.00% 0.62\n5% 20.04% 0.00% 0.62\nLocal correlation 10% 49.08% 0.00% 0.76\n5% 37.12% 0.00% 0.7\nLocal regression 10% 20.67% 0.00% 0.62\n5% 12.88% 0.00% 0.58\nFuzzy model 10% 87.27% 0.00% 0.95\n5% 67.08% 0.00% 0.82\nAnalytical model 10% 35.13% 0.00% 0.64\n5% 23.92% 0.00% 0.69\nOverall 10% 87.27% 0.00% 0.95\n5% 67.08% 0.00% 0.82\nfault levels of 10%, the other containing fault levels of 5% in\nsome channels. Hence this data set is a good benchmark for the\nsensitivity of the methods with respect to less significant faults.\nThe training data set contained around 1000 points, while the\ntest data sets contained 2052 points, where approximately half\nof them were faulty. Practically, all the methods produced\nbetween 0% and 2% false detections using only an optimal\nvalue for the threshold. All the detection results are listed in\ntable 1.\nFrom this table it can be concluded that the FD system\nbased on the adaptive fuzzy inference system (ANFIS [17])\nand trained off-line produced by far the best results of all\nmethods. This model and the training procedure described in\n[17] are, however, not suitable for use in the on-line mode\nbecause of the iterative nature of the gradient-based search\nalgorithm used. When the data are fed into the system in\nthe on-line mode (sample by sample) the results deteriorate\nsignificantly (a drop of detection rate from 87.27% to 46.95%\nin the case of fault levels of 10% and from 67.08% to\n22.60% in the case of fault levels of 5% can be observed).\nA further analysis of these results is needed for the on-line\ncase, because recent parallel studies [4, 23]) indicate that\nthe incremental on-line learning methods for fuzzy models\noutperform ANFIS. Surprisingly, the analytical models did not\nproduced stronger results than all the data-driven modelling\napproaches for all tested fault levels. Furthermore, in the case\nof fault levels of 10% analytical models were even weaker than\nthe incremental learning method for fuzzy systems (35.13%\nversus 46.95%).\n5.3.2. Results on real measured engine test bench data.\nThe second tests concerned the plausibility check of hybrid\n(simulation) models. These models possess an analytical\nstructure in the form of regressor terms and unknown linear\nparameters which should be identified using the training\ndata, which was developed for a spark ignition engine with\ngasoline direct injection. Six different hybrid models were\ndeveloped for engine-out emission using carbon monoxide,\ntotal unburned hydrocarbon and nitric oxide, in-cylinder air\ntrapped mass, exhaust pressure and temperature, all measured\nas average values in steady operation. Actually, these variables\nare linked to the transient processes occurring in the cylinder\nduring one or two consecutive crankshaft revolutions, namely\nthe air flow through inlet valves during the down stroke of\n1816\nAn approach to model-based fault detection in industrial measurement systems\nFigure 4. Detection rate (left) and false detection rate (right) depending on the fault level (along the x-axis) and fault quantity (different line\nstyles).\nthe piston, followed by compression, combustion, expansion,\nblow down and expulsion of exhaust gases. The common\napproach in taking into account these transient phenomena\nis a theoretical analysis leading to a differential equation\nrepresenting the process. The problem is to find models\nusable by the FDIC algorithm, i.e. relationships with one\ntarget channel as a function of other input channels. Often,\nan integration of the differential equation does not lead to this\nresult, but allows highlighting of the functional links between\nthe various variables. The alternative is to resort to pre-\nexistent knowledge or experimental analysis on the effects\nof the variation of each input on the target variable. For\ninlet air mass flow the first method was followed, namely a\npreliminary analysis of the energy balance in differential terms,\nleading to a differential equation. By integration and the proper\nrearrangement, the following formula can be obtained,\nm\n\u03c10C\n= a1\n(\npm\nRTm\n)0.8 1\nN0.2\n+ a2\npexh\n287Tm\n+ a3\npm\nRTm\n+ a4\npIVC\n287Tm\nwhere m denotes the air mass trapped inside the cylinder, \u03c10 is\nthe reference air density, C is the cylinder displacement, pm is\nthe inlet manifold mean pressure, Tm is the inlet manifold\nmean temperature, R is the gas constant, N is the engine\nrotation speed, pexh is the exhaust manifold mean pressure, and\npIVC is the pressure in the cylinder at the inlet valve closing.\nRegarding the exhaust gas temperature at the exhaust port, it is\nknown that this mainly depends on spark advance, relative\nair\/fuel ratio, and load related to inlet manifold pressure.\nDependence on heat exchange was also considered including\nengine rpm. Thus the model\nTexh = a1pm + a2pexh + a3\u0007adv + a4\u03bb + a5N + a6N2\nwas proposed, where Texh denotes the exhaust manifold mean\ntemperature, pexh is the exhaust manifold mean pressure, pm is\nthe inlet manifold mean pressure, \u0007adv is the spark advance, \u03bb\nis the relative air\/full ratio and N is the engine rotation speed.\nThe other four hybrid models that were used are not stated\nhere in detail. The linear parameters within these models (see\nabove) could be identified based on an experimental training\nfault-free data set in a generic manner and in terms of using\nthe same estimation algorithm for all six models. 2204 values\n(116 data rows times 19 channels) of fault-free data samples\nwere used. It is interesting to note that the resulting linear\nparameters and hence complete models were almost the same\nusing both off-line training based on least-squares estimation\n[20] as well as on-line incremental learning [23]. It illustrates\nthat convergence of the on-line incremental learning is quite\nsatisfactory for real practical cases. The test data sets were\nobtained by introducing fault levels of 3%, 5%, 10%, 20%\nand 50% (with random + or \u2212 sign) in order to achieve 2% of\nfaulty single values with respect to the total number of values\n2204. Further random errors were added in the same way to\nachieve 5% and 10% of faulty single values respectively. This\nprocedure produced 15 test data sets, from which detections\nwere extracted as shown in figure 4.\nIt can be clearly seen that the false detection rate is\nnegligible, as it is 0 for all cases except in the case of a low rate\nof faulty data (2%). The detection rate is quite high, especially\nfor fault levels (intensities) of 20% and more (which usually\nrepresent the really significant faults on an engine test bench).\nThe relatively lower detection rates for fault levels of 3% and\n5% stem from the fact that the model errors consisting of bias\nand variance error trigger confidence intervals which are larger\nthan 3%, respectively 5%, deviation from the model in certain\ninput regions. However, with the threshold thr as defined on\nthe right-hand side of (11), the width of the confidence band\ncan be enlarged. It was set to a value of 5 for all six hybrid\nsimulation models (which was slightly below the default value\nof 8). It should also be recognized that the fault isolation rates\nwere between 15% and 20% lower than the fault detection\nrates, but still inside an acceptable range for the operators.\n5.4. On-line results\nA fuzzy model and a correlation-based model were built based\non the first 30 or 50 fault-free data samples. These models\nwere later used for dynamic adaptation and to check the\nplausibility of the on-line recorded data from a diesel engine.\nFor consolidation of different fault conclusions the \u2018OR\u2019 type\nof aggregation has been used. Faulty data points were ignored\nand not used for on-line model adaptation. The following\nresults were obtained for real data coming in on-line from a\nlarge diesel engine:\noverall detection rate: 64.7%;\noverall false detection rate: 0.0%.\nThis result is very promising bearing in mind that many\nsmall faults (with a deviation of 5% or less) were present in\n1817\nP Angelov et al\nthis real data set and no fuzzy models and correlation models\nwere pre-built from fault-free and high-quality training data.\nMoreover, all major faults (with a deviation of 20% or more),\nwhich are significant and critical and hence have to be detected,\nhave actually been detected. If the feedback is omitted (see the\nline on top of figure 1) faulty data points are also incorporated\ninto the model building steps for both the fuzzy model and the\ncorrelation models, and the detection rate decreases by about\n15\u201320%. This illustrates the essential role of the feedback for\nstopping the influence of the faulty data on the update of the\nFD model.\n6. Conclusion and future directions\nIn this paper, the analytical basis of the FD logic integrated\ninto a FDIC framework was demonstrated on real data from\ncar engine test benches. The proposed FDIC framework\nhas a generic nature and is applicable to any complex\ncontemporary industrial measurement system. The proposed\nreference model-based framework has been applied to both\noff-line simulated data and real data in both off-line and\non-line modes using vehicle engine test benches for Alfa\nRomeo and Caterpillar. The results demonstrate the viability\nof the proposed methodology and its superiority over the\nconventional correlation- and regression-based models and\nover analytical (first principles-based) models. The rate of\nfalse detections can be expected to be very small. The\nproposed approach is potentially very useful for early FDIC\nin real time in various industrial systems. Promising future\nextension includes development of the local error bars for\ndata-driven models in order to cope with extrapolation and\ndifferent data densities in different local areas. The application\nof the proposed approach to practical industrial measurement\nsystems will be addressed in the near future.\nAcknowledgment\nThis work was supported by the European Commission\n(project GRD1-2001-40034).\nReferences\n[1] Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement 1995\n(Geneva: International Organization for Standardization)\n[2] Alag S, Agogino A M and Morjaria M 2001 A methodology\nfor intelligent sensor measurement, validation, fusion, and\nfault detection for equipment monitoring and diagnostics\nArtif.
