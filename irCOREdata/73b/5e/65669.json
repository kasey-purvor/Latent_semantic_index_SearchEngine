Their applications in unsaturated soil testing\nare recent and diverse, and include the development of tensi-\nometer-based suction control systems (Jotisankasa et al.,\n2007), determination of the soil-water retention curve (Toker et\nal., 2004; Lourenc\u00b8o et al., 2007), direct shear tests (Tarantino\n& Tombolato, 2005), field suction measurements (Ridley et al.,\n2003; Mendes et al., 2008) and testing of rammed earth\nmaterials (Jaquin et al., 2008). The component parts of a\ntypical tensiometer (of the type used in the research to be\ndescribed below) are shown in Fig. 1. A closed casing contains\na high air entry porous stone, behind which there is a pressure\ntransducer. Between the stone and the transducer is a small\nreservoir of water. When the tensiometer is placed against a\nsoil surface the water in the stone equilibrates to the pressure\nof the pore water in the soil. This pressure is also transmitted to\nthe water in the reservoir and hence to the pressure transducer.\nManuscript received 2 August 2007; revised manuscript accepted\n17 July 2008.\nDiscussion on this paper closes on 1 April 2009, for further details\nsee p. ii.\n* Geotechnical Observations Limited, Egham, UK (formerly Dur-\nham University).\n\u2020 Department of Civil Engineering, University of Glasgow, UK.\n\u2021 School of Engineering, Durham University, UK.\n\u00a7 Controls Testing Equipment Ltd, Wykeham Farrance Division,\nTring, UK.\n\u00b6 School of the Built Environment, Heriot-Watt University,\nEdinburgh, UK.\nPorous stone\nReservoir ( 5\u00b702 mm )v \u0001 3\nCeramic transducer\nElectrical connection\n7\u00b700 mm\n0\u00b710 mm\n10\u00b700 mm\nSpacer\nCasing\nFig. 1. Component parts of the Durham University\u2013Wykeham\nFarrance typical tensiometer\nThe performance of tensiometers depends strongly on\ntheir saturation (as this controls the maximum measurable\nsuction) and their accurate calibration. Recent studies have\nfocused on the former, particularly aspects of the pre-\nconditioning procedure employed for saturation, such as the\nmagnitude and duration of the positive pre-pressurisation\nstage and the effect of initial flooding of the tensiometer\nunder vacuum (e.g. Tarantino & Mongiovi, 2001; Take &\nBolton, 2003). Calibration has received less attention, how-\never, with only one dedicated study by Tarantino & Mon-\ngiovi (2003) to our knowledge.\nCalibration is the relation between a known imposed value\n(input) and the read value (output). For a tensiometer the\ninput is water pressure and the output is a d.c. voltage. A\ncalibration factor m is derived (assuming a linear relation-\nship between input and output using a least-squares regres-\nsion technique) as the ratio of voltage in \u0001V to water\npressure in kPa. Calibration error is the difference between\nan imposed value of suction and the value obtained from the\nregression equation using the measured output. As tensi-\nometers work in the negative pressure range, calibration\nshould ideally be done by imposing negative pressure values.\nHowever, owing to the difficulty of generating negative\nwater pressures within the environment of conventional soil\nmechanics laboratories, tensiometers are generally calibrated\nin the positive range, and a linear extrapolation of the\ncalibration equation is assumed to be applicable to the\nnegative range (Sjoblom, 1996; Meilani et al., 2002; Take &\nBolton, 2003).\nThe purpose of the research presented here is to study\nand validate the extrapolation of calibration from the posi-\ntive range to the negative range for high-suction tensi-\nometers. A series of tests were carried out in which target\nnegative pressures (suctions) were applied to a tensiometer\nand compared with the values derived from a calibration\ncurve extrapolated from the positive pressure range. This\npaper discusses features of the tests themselves as well as\nthe effect of cyclical variation of pressure on tensiometer\nperformance. Following this, a comparison is made with\ncalibrations in the positive range to assess the accuracy of\nextrapolation. Throughout the following the error e in using\nextrapolation is the ratio\ne \u00bc\nuw\u00f0 \u00dee \u0001 uw\u00f0 \u00dea\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\nuw\u00f0 \u00dea\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n3 100% (1)\nwhere (uw)a is the applied target negative pressure and (uw)e\nis the estimated pressure measured by the tensiometer using\nthe extrapolation of the positive calibration curve to the\nnegative pressure range.\nTENSIOMETER CALIBRATION METHODS\nTable 1 contains a summary of tensiometer calibration\nmethods that will be examined in turn below. The only\ndirect method to calibrate in the negative pressure range\n(suitable for high-suction tensiometers) employs pressurisa-\ntion from the back of the tensiometer. This technique has\nthe advantage of replicating the exact conditions in which\nthe tensiometer will be used. Pressurisation from the back of\nthe tensiometer induces a deflection of the transducer dia-\nphragm in the direction of the soil, that is, in the same\ndirection as that induced by a negative pressure in the\nreservoir. In Tarantino & Mongiovi (2003) a tensiometer of\nthe general form of Fig. 1 was used, but with a strain-\ngauged diaphragm replacing the transducer, behind which\nwas a sealed chamber that could be pressurised. The extra-\npolation error was found to be 1\u20131.5%, which, the authors\nstate, justifies extrapolation in this case.\nThe technique proposed by Tarantino & Mongiovi (2003)\nis probably the most suitable for calibration since it repli-\ncates almost exactly the effect of a negative pressure on the\ntransducer. However, the technique requires adaptation of the\ntensiometer for air pressure application from the back, which\nimplies that each tensiometer has to be designed and built\nso that it can easily be switched between calibration, satura-\ntion and use. In the case of the tensiometer used for this\nresearch, it was not possible to pressurise the back of the\ntensiometer because a cement sealant completely isolates the\nelectrical wires connected to the transducer (see Fig. 1). This\nis a necessary feature for a tensiometer that may be used in\na submersible environment, such as inside a triaxial cell.\nIndirect methods to assess the validity of the extrapolated\ncalibration have greater applicability than the direct method\ndescribed above, and have been more widely used in the\npast. These include the axis-translation technique and the\nisotropic unloading technique. Both techniques impose a\ntarget suction on a soil sample. The suction read by a\ntensiometer in contact with the sample using the extrapo-\nlated calibration equation is compared with the applied\ntarget suction, and the accuracy of extrapolation is measured.\nIn addition, it is possible to apply small negative pressures\n(down to \u0001100 kPa) using a vacuum pump attached to a\ntriaxial cell, but this has limited application for high-suction\ntensiometers.\nThe axis-translation technique imposes a known value of\nsuction on an unsaturated soil sample by elevating the pore\nair pressure while keeping the pore water pressure at atmo-\nspheric value. The air pressure is subsequently reduced while\na tensiometer in contact with the soil sample measures the\ncorresponding decreases of pore water pressure (in the nega-\ntive range). Assuming that equilibrium is attained at the\nimposed value of suction, the tensiometer should read a\nnegative value of pore water pressure identical to the\ncorresponding reduction in pore air pressure. Guan & Fre-\ndlund (1997) used this technique to investigate the accuracy\nTable 1. Methods of tensiometer calibration\nRange Name of technique Direct or indirect?

The calibration error was between 0.5%\nand 8.5%. Previous data by the authors (Lourenc\u00b8o et al.,\n2006) using the axis-translation technique showed an error\nof approximately 5%, that is, within the same range as\nreported by Guan & Fredlund (1997). In both studies the\nobserved tendency was for the suction to stabilise at smaller\nvalues than those imposed, after each drop of the air\npressure. This was interpreted as water transfer from the\nporous stone of the pressure plate to the sample.\nThe isotropic unloading technique uses a tensiometer to\nread the negative pore water pressure imposed by undrained\nunloading of a saturated soil sample initially consolidated to\na given effective stress under a back-pressure equal to or\ngreater than zero. According to the effective stress principle,\nany change in mean total stresses in undrained conditions\nshould generate an equal pore water pressure change. Ridley\n& Burland (1993) tested kaolin samples consolidated to\ndifferent values of effective stresses (up to \u00021500 kPa) with\na constant back-pressure of 200 kPa. The samples were then\nunloaded with the drainage line closed while the generated\nsoil suction was measured by the tensiometer. Subsequently\nthe samples were reloaded, still under undrained conditions,\nto the same initial total stress, and the back-pressure was\nagain measured to calculate the corresponding effective\nstress (which was in general different from the value initially\nimposed). The error was calculated as the difference between\nthe suction measured by the tensiometer and the imposed\neffective stress. Ridley & Burland (1993) found that the\nerror was smaller if the effective stress measured after\nreloading was used in the calculation, as the suction read by\nthe tensiometer was noticeably smaller than the effective\nstress initially imposed (i.e. before unloading of the sample).\nThe indirect methods outlined above use equipment easily\navailable in laboratories (e.g. a triaxial cell with a porous\nstone) for assessing the accuracy of the extrapolated calibra-\ntion equation, and do not require a tensiometer with a\nspecific design. Previous work (cited above) made use of\nthese techniques, but such studies were focused on introdu-\ncing new tensiometers to the geotechnical community, and it\nremains unclear which of these two techniques provides the\nmost accurate way of validating the extrapolated calibration\nequation. In the light of these limitations, the present re-\nsearch was initiated to provide a consistent set of data\nrelating to the techniques available to assess the accuracy of\nthe extrapolated calibration equation. The testing programme\nconsisted of calibrating a tensiometer in the positive range\n(by a variety of methods) and then comparing the suction\nmeasured by the tensiometer using the extrapolated calibra-\ntion equation against target values of suction imposed on a\nsoil sample by using the axis-translation and isotropic un-\nloading techniques. An additional comparison was also\nperformed against negative pressures down to \u0001100 kPa\nimposed via a vacuum pump and measured by the same\ntransducer used for the calibration in the positive range.\nCalibration equations were obtained for single or several\ncycles of imposed pressure (to study any hysteretical effect\nof the calibration equation). Related aspects are discussed,\nnamely the influence of external forces, error calculation,\nhysteresis of the calibration equation, and alternative techni-\nques to assess the accuracy of the extrapolated calibration.\nEQUIPMENT AND MATERIAL\nThe tensiometer used had a porous stone with an air entry\nvalue of 1500 kPa. Details of the tensiometer characteristics\nand saturation procedures can be found in Lourenc\u00b8o et al.\n(2006). The calibration was performed in the positive range\nagainst a standard transducer (maximum capacity of\n2000 kPa), previously calibrated against a dead load ma-\nchine. This same transducer was used as the reference\nmeasure for the air pressure imposed in the axis-translation\ntechnique, for the cell pressure or back-pressure imposed in\nthe isotropic unloading technique, and for the negative\npressure imposed by the vacuum pump. The axis-translation\ntests and isotropic unloading tests were conducted in a\ntriaxial cell fitted with a pedestal containing a porous stone\nwith an air entry value of 500 kPa. This allowed easier\ncontrol of the water conditions below the porous stone,\ncompared with the pressure plate used by Guan & Fredlund\n(1997). Calibrations in the positive range were conducted in\na purpose-built saturation manifold (Donoghue, 2006) and in\na triaxial cell. In the saturation manifold the tensiometer is\nfastened from the back and sealed on the sides by an O-ring\nand a metallic ring (the metallic ring was designed to\nimprove the sealing at high pressures). A labelled photo-\ngraph of the manifold is shown in Fig. 2. The TRIAX\nsoftware was used for data acquisition (Toll, 1999).\nReconstituted Speswhite kaolin samples were used for the\ntests using the isotropic unloading and axis-translation tech-\nniques. Speswhite kaolin was chosen for its availability, its\nhomogeneity (ensuring reproducibility), and its ability to\ncover the suction range of the tensiometer with a relatively\nhigh cavitation limit. It is also non-expansive and reasonably\npermeable (for a clay), avoids effects related to temperature\nfluctuations, and enables relatively fast equalisation of pore\nwater pressure. Kaolin was initially mixed with distilled\nwater at a water content of 200% to form a slurry and\nplaced in a Rowe cell for one-dimensional consolidation at\n250 kPa. Samples were then cored using 38 mm samplers,\nand coated with liquid paraffin wax in several layers to\nprevent moisture losses. All samples had a water content of\napproximately 42%, initial void ratio of 1.13, and degree of\nsaturation of 98.7%.\nCALIBRATION IN THE POSITIVE RANGE\nIn order to study the validity of extrapolation, it was first\nnecessary to obtain a calibration in the positive range for the\ntensiometer used. This calibration was performed in three\nways (Table 1). Calibrations were carried out in the satura-\ntion manifold (Fig. 2), with different holding-down forces\napplied to the tensiometer in the seating. Two further\ncalibrations were then carried out with the tensiometer inside\na triaxial cell. First, a calibration was carried out in what we\nterm \u2018isotropic\u2019 conditions, by submerging the probe in\nwater and increasing the cell pressure in steps. This calibra-\ntion method corresponds to a condition where the pressure\napplied to the inner transducer through the ceramic stone is\nthe same as the pressure applied externally to the probe\u2019s\nbody. Second, a calibration was carried out in what we term\n\u2018anisotropic\u2019 conditions, by consolidating a soil sample at a\nTensiometer\ncables\nHolding-down\nbolts\nManifold\nvessel\nWater in\nunder\npressure\nFig. 2.

At\nthe same time, the tensiometer was maintained directly in\ncontact with the soil through a grommet on the sample\u2019s\nside, sealed by O-rings and painted with several layers of\nliquid latex rubber. The procedure for placing the tensi-\nometer in contact with the sample is similar to that de-\nscribed by Hight (1982) for sealing a piezometer probe on a\nsample\u2019s side during saturated triaxial tests, and has been\nused frequently since (e.g. Wong et al., 2001; Jotisankasa,\n2005). This calibration method corresponds to a condition\nwhere the pressure applied to the transducer through the\nceramic stone was equal to the back-pressure inside the\nsample, and different from the cell pressure applied exter-\nnally to the tensiometer\u2019s body.\nThe calibration factors m obtained for the four cases\ndescribed above are shown in Fig. 3 together with the plots\nof voltage against applied pressure. There is a clear differ-\nence between these calibration methods. The effect of loose\nor tight fitting in the saturation manifold is significant, while\ntests conducted with the tensiometer in \u2018isotropic\u2019 or \u2018aniso-\ntropic\u2019 conditions inside the triaxial cell show closer calibra-\ntion factors. The two calibration factors that differed most\n(i.e. for the tensiometer fixed tightly in the saturation mani-\nfold and in \u2018isotropic\u2019 conditions respectively) show a differ-\nence of 9.8%, indicating that, in order to obtain accurate\nmeasurement of suctions, the tensiometer should ideally be\ncalibrated using a method that resembles conditions of use.\nFurther possible evidence for this can be found in the study\nby Jotisankasa (2005). Given the authors\u2019 findings here, the\ncalibration factor used later to check extrapolation to the\nnegative pressure range was that obtained under \u2018isotropic\u2019\nconditions.\nHysteretic effects due to imposed positive pressure\nchanges were also studied. The procedure followed consisted\nof submerging the tensiometer in water in a triaxial cell and\napplying five cycles of cell pressure between zero and\n600 kPa. The increments of cell pressure were applied in\nsteps followed by waiting periods to ensure that the tensi-\nometer readings achieved equilibrium. Data for these pres-\nsure cycles are shown in Fig. 4, where the series of loops\ncorresponding to consecutive increments of cell pressure\ncould be attributed to the low permeability of the stone\ncausing a delay in the tensiometer response. As the dia-\nphragm deflects, a small amount of water flows inwards or\noutwards, depending on whether pressure increases or de-\ncreases respectively. After each increase of pressure a period\nof time of 1 to 2 min is necessary for this flow process to be\ncompleted and for tensiometer readings to stabilise. By\nconsidering only the final equilibrium points for each incre-\nment of cell pressure, the same calibration factor as given in\nFig. 3 for \u2018isotropic\u2019 conditions is obtained.\nMETHODS OF CHECKING EXTRAPOLATION\nHaving obtained a calibration in the positive pressure\nrange, three methods (one direct and two indirect) were\ninvestigated to check the extrapolation of such calibration to\nthe negative pressure range. This also included the study of\nsome aspects of the methods themselves such as, for exam-\nple, the study of hysteretic effects.\nApplication of vacuum\nThe first extrapolation check used a direct method of\napplying negative pressures down to \u2013100 kPa by means of\na vacuum pump. Despite its limitations for high-suction\ntensiometers, it was thought useful to include such a method\nin this study as a comparison with other indirect techniques.\nThe tensiometer was submerged in a cup in free water\nplaced inside a triaxial cell. Vacuum was applied inside the\ncell in three different cycles and maintained constant for\nshort periods of time at different stages during each cycle\n(see Fig. 5). Tensiometer readings (using the calibration\nfactor extrapolated from the \u2018isotropic\u2019 method in the posi-\ntive range) were compared against the imposed negative\npressure (measured by the same transducer used during the\ncalibration in the positive range). The results in Fig. 5 show\nthat the pressure transducer controlling the vacuum returns\nto zero after each cycle, whereas the tensiometer shows a\nslight shift in measurements throughout the three cycles.\nWith the cell pressure at zero, the tensiometer reading after\nthe second cycle was approximately 2 kPa and after the third\nwas 3 kPa. This suggests that calibration could be drifting as\npressures are ranged between zero and \u0001100 kPa, but there\nis no evidence of a change of the calibration factor m.\nSuction-induced hysteresis of this nature has also been\nseen in studies involving the continuous use of a tensiometer\nfor soil testing, such as the experimental programme de-\n0\n4000\n8000\n12000\n16000\n20000\n0\nApplied pressure: kPa\nTe\nns\nio\nm\net\ner\n r\nea\ndi\nng\n:  \n v\u00b5\nSaturation manifold loose\nSaturation manifold tight\nIsotropic\nAnisotropic\nm\n11\u00b7816\n12\u00b7243\n11\u00b7182\n11\u00b7380\n1600140012001000800600400200\nFig. 3.

Cycles of pressure by application of vacuum\n662 LOURENC\u00b8O, GALLIPOLI, TOLL, AUGARDE, EVANS AND MEDERO\nscribed in Lourenc\u00b8o et al. (2007), where values read by the\ntensiometer, when plunged in free water before and after a\ntest, were seen to change by as much as 14 kPa, although\nvalues were usually below 5 kPa. This might be explained\nby a small calibration drift when the tensiometer is working\nin the negative range, which, however, would be significant\nonly at very low suctions, given that the calibration factor m\nremains unchanged. There is also the possibility that this\nphenomenon appears only when using tensiometers at low\nsuctions, but this seems unlikely, as it has been seen in\ntensiometers used continuously for a period of one year,\nregardless of the suctions measured. While the nature of this\ndrift is unclear, it seems to be restricted to the negative\npressure range. When pressure was cycled in the positive\nrange between zero and 600 kPa, as previously described,\nthe tensiometer reading always returned to zero at the end of\neach cycle. Tarantino & Mongiovi (2003) also found a\nchange in the calibration when tensiometers were used in\nthe negative range. For those authors quick cycles of nega-\ntive pressure were seen to improve the measurement accu-\nracy.\nIsotropic unloading\nThe procedure followed for the isotropic unloading test in\nthis research had one difference from that described by\nRidley & Burland (1993). A zero pore water pressure,\ninstead of 200 kPa, was imposed on the sample before\nunloading. Therefore the suction read by the tensiometer\nwas compared with the initial total stress applied to the\nsample (which in this case is equal to the effective stresses).\nA sample was enclosed in a latex membrane and mounted in\nthe triaxial cell, with the drainage line open to the atmo-\nsphere to ensure a zero pore water pressure. The tensiometer\nwas set directly in contact with the sample through a\ngrommet, as in the \u2018anisotropic\u2019 positive pressure calibration\ndescribed above. The arrangement for the isotropic unload-\ning tests is shown in Fig. 6. Cell pressure was then quickly\nincreased, producing a build-up of excess pore water pres-\nsures read by the tensiometer. After dissipation of the excess\npore water pressure, and with the tensiometer reading zero,\nthe back-pressure drainage line was shut and the cell pres-\nsure was decreased while the tensiometer measurements\nwere recorded (using the extrapolated positive calibration).\nResults from an initial test are shown in Fig. 7. Owing to\nthe high degree of saturation (98.7%), it was considered\nunnecessary to saturate the sample under a back-pressure.\nThe sample was initially consolidated to 454 kPa of effective\nstress, and, with the tensiometer reading zero, the drainage\nline was closed before decreasing the cell pressure first to\n252.6 kPa and then to zero. For the first drop the cell\npressure decreased by 201.4 kPa, while the suction measured\nby the tensiometer was equal to 190.2 kPa. The ratio be-\ntween the target and measured values of suction is therefore\n0.944, and the extrapolation error is about 5.6%. For the\nsecond drop in cell pressure the error is similar, that is,\nabout 5.4%. Both errors are quite large but comparable to\nthose obtained by Guan & Fredlund (1997) and Lourenc\u00b8o et\nal. (2006) by using the axis-translation technique.\nThe results also revealed an unexpected increase of the\npore water pressure after unloading, and this was attributed\nto water adsorption from the sample. After ending the test it\nwas found that the latex rubber had detached from the\nsample\u2019s membrane, which could have led to water infiltrat-\ning from the cell to the sample through the grommet. Water\nimbibition could have also occurred from the porous stone,\nor from the reservoir below the porous stone in the pedestal\nof the triaxial cell. Also, as water pressure decreases below\nthe \u0001100 kPa threshold, cavitation could have occurred in\nthe drainage tubing. There is also the possibility that cavita-\ntion could have occurred within the pores of the kaolin,\nresulting in a decrease of suction due to the formation of\nsmall air bubbles.\nTo overcome some of these problems, a second test was\ncarried out in which the sealing of the sample was improved\nby eliminating the tube connecting the top cap to the triaxial\nbase. A system was also introduced for blowing dry air\nthrough the drainage system below the porous stone in the\npedestal of the triaxial cell before unloading. This follows\nthe example of Bishop et al. (1975), who modified a triaxial\ncell base so that water could be removed when required. To\navoid the water leaks through the grommet the entire sample\n(including the grommet) was painted with the liquid latex in\nseveral layers, and was then sealed with extra O-rings at the\ntop cap and pedestal, and around the grommet. The im-\nproved sealing removed the suction decrease after unloading,\nbut resulted in a similar extrapolation error of approximately\n5.0% (Fig. 8).\nIn Ridley (1993) specimens were reloaded after the un-\nloading stage, and the changes in pore water pressure during\nunloading were compared with that during reloading. The\ndifference observed by Ridley (1993) was 2.2% up to\n1200 kPa and increasing afterwards, but was still better than\nthe 5% value from this research. However, so far, the pore\nwater pressure change has been compared with the total\nstress change during unloading. This makes the implicit\nSample\nLatex rubber\nTop cap\nO-rings\nRubber membrane\nDrainage line\nPedestal\nTensiometer\nGrommet\n\u03c33\n\u03c33\u03c33\n\u03c33\u03c33\nFig. 6.

Initial isotropic unloading test\nCALIBRATIONS OF A HIGH-SUCTION TENSIOMETER 663\nassumption that the pore pressure parameter B is equal to\nunity, so that no change of effective stress occurs in the\nsolid skeleton, and the pore water pressure change equals\nthe total stress change. However, the assumption of B \u00bc 1 is\nincorrect, as the degree of saturation was not 100%, but\n98.7% as stated above, and measured B values were approxi-\nmately 0.96. (Note that, while the samples were not fully\nsaturated, the B values were above the limit of 0.95 as\nprescribed by BS 1377. Using a back-pressure saturation\ntechnique would only cause air to dissolve in the pore water.\nThis dissolved air would probably come out of solution\nduring unloading, thus giving differential B values between\nloading and unloading, which is undesirable.) To allow for\nthis, we assume that the same proportion of the total stress\nchange is transferred to the solid skeleton when the soil is\nloaded or unloaded, and in this case the extrapolation error\ncan be calculated as the difference between the B value for\nunloading (denoted Bu) and the B value for loading (denoted\nBl) divided by Bl. To demonstrate this new procedure for\nerror calculation, the test shown in Fig. 8 was continued by\ncycling the cell pressure at increasing total stresses, where\nthe values of Bl and Bu are obtained for each cycle. The\nresults are plotted in Fig. 9 with the corresponding values of\nBl and Bu for the first eight cycles given in Table 2. Using\nthis procedure for error calculation, the agreement between\nimposed and measured values is very good, with errors\nsmaller than 0.81% (Table 2).\nAxis translation\nThe second indirect method of checking extrapolation\nused the axis-translation technique. A sample was placed on\na previously saturated porous stone (with air entry value of\n500 kPa) in the triaxial cell. The tensiometer was gently\npushed 2\u20133 mm inside the top surface of the soil sample to\nensure a good contact, and so that it could stand vertically\nby itself. No membrane was used to contain the sample, and\nthe pore air pressure was applied directly within the cell.\nThe arrangement for the axis-translation tests is shown in\nFig. 10. The advantage of using a triaxial cell instead of a\npressure plate for the axis-translation technique is that it\nallowed a better control of the water conditions within and\nbelow the porous stone.\nSimilar problems to those observed in the isotropic un-\nloading tests were observed during axis-translation tests. On\nreleasing the air pressure there would be an immediate\ndecrease of pore water pressure, but thereafter the pore water\npressure would increase back with time.

The pore air pressure was changed in several steps (e.g.\nreducing from 600 kPa to zero then increasing in similar\nsteps back to 600 kPa). A series of three cycles were\nimposed on the sample, and the pore water pressure read by\nthe tensiometer was compared against the pore air pressure\nread by the same pressure transducer as used for the calibra-\ntion of the tensiometer in the positive range. Plots of the\npore air pressure applied within the cell and the negative\npore water pressure measured by the tensiometer using the\nextrapolated calibration curve are given in Fig. 11(a), and\nshow the following.\n(a) After each decrease of pore air pressure, the pore water\npressure instantaneously decreased. However, it subse-\nquently increased back while pore air pressure was held\nconstant. This can be clearly seen in the first two\nunloading steps in cycle 1, where, although the\ntensiometer reading dropped immediately on reducing\npressure, it then started to move back towards zero. The\nsame effect can be seen in Fig. 11(b), which shows\ncycle 3 on an expanded timescale. The likely reason for\nthis is that water is being drawn out of the porous stone\nof the triaxial cell into the sample. This effect\ndisappeared as pore air pressure decreased, suggesting\nthat all free water had been removed by this stage.\nProgressive evaporation of water from the porous stone\nof the triaxial cell and the sample is also expected to\nhappen throughout the test as a consequence of the low\nrelative humidity of the compressor air feed to the cell\ncompared with the equilibrium relative humidity at\nsuch low suctions. If the mixing ratio vapour\/dry air\nprovided by the compressor is assumed to be constant,\nthe evaporation rate will also tend to accelerate after\neach reduction of pressure, because each reduction of\npressure would cause a proportional decrease of the\nvapour partial pressure, and hence a drop of the relative\nhumidity inside the cell. The progressive evaporation\nfrom the porous stone of the triaxial cell, combined\nwith the sucking up of water from the sample, will\neventually reduce the availability of free water inside\nthe stone, and will result in the disappearance of the\ntendency for the pore water pressure to increase back\nafter each air pressure drop. However, at the end of\neach cycle water pressure becomes positive, as shown\nin Fig. 11(a), resulting in some of the water previously\nsucked by the sample to be released back into the\nporous stone of the triaxial cell. As a consequence, free\nwater is available again when pressure is decreased at\nthe start of the next cycle, and once more the pore\nwater pressure tends to increase after an air pressure\ndrop.\n(b) During the ascending part of the curves the pore water\npressure increased instantaneously after an increase of\npore air pressure, showing a tendency to reduce slowly\nwith time while air pressure was kept constant after\neach stage. Again, this effect can be explained by the\nfact that water evaporates from the sample in an\nattempt to establish hygroscopic equilibrium inside the\ncell. In this case, the evaporation rate will tend to slow\ndown after each increase of pressure, because an\nincrease of pressure produces an increase of vapour\npartial pressure, and hence an increase of relative\nhumidity, inside the cell. As a note, the degree of\nsaturation at the end of the test was 92.3%. Table 3\nshows the results in terms of the change of pore water\npressure instantaneously measured after each step\nchange of air pressure for cycle 3 shown in Fig.\n11(b). The error is rather large, with the measured\nchange of pore water pressure tending to be generally\ngreater than the imposed change of air pressure by an\namount that could be as big as 8%. The error is also\nseen to increase at higher suctions. Only at the end of\nthe first cycle was a change of water pressure\nsignificantly smaller than the increase of air pressure\nobserved. This can be explained by the fact that in this\ncase the pore air pressure was slowly increased to\n600 kPa, and the pore water pressure started dissipating\nas it became positive. Since the water channels below\nthe porous stone of the triaxial cell had been blown dry,\nwater under positive pressure would be able to flow out\nof the specimen and into space below the porous stone.\nIn contrast to the above, previous tests by Lourenc\u00b8o et al.\n(2006) showed changes of pore water pressures whose\nmagnitude was always smaller than the corresponding\nchanges of air pressure. These tests were performed in a\npressure plate rather than in a triaxial cell, and a further\ndifference was that air pressure was released to zero in a\n\u0002600\n\u0002400\n\u0002200\n0\n200\n400\n600\n0\nTime: daysP\nre\nss\nur\ne:\n k\nP\na\ncycle 1\nAir pressure\nPore water pressure\ncycle 3cycle 2\n30252015105\n29272523211917\n(b)\n\u0002600\n\u0002400\n\u0002200\n0\n200\n400\n600\nTime: days\nP\nre\nss\nur\ne:\n k\nP\na\nAir pressure\nPore water pressure\n(a)\nFig. 11.

The water channels beneath the porous stone of\nthe pressure plate were also filled with free water, rather\nthan being blown dry. Guan & Fredlund (1997) reported\nsimilar results to this study for some tests where the pore\nwater pressure increase measured by the tensiometer was\nhigher than the air pressure increase by about 5%. The\nauthors give no reason for such behaviour.\nA possible explanation for the fact that the magnitude of\npore water pressure change was generally greater than the\nimposed change of pore air pressure could be the movement\nof water from the porous stone of the triaxial cell to the soil,\nand rearrangement of water within the pores of the stone. The\ntop surface of the porous stone is subject to the applied air\npressure, but the bottom surface is subject to atmospheric\npressure. Initially there is likely to be a film of free water on\nthis bottom surface. During the first drops in pore air pressure\nthere will be water transfer from the stone to the soil (limiting\nthe corresponding decrease of pore water pressure). Further\ndecreases of air pressure will eventually remove all free water\nfrom the bottom surface of the stone.\nWhen air pressure in the cell is decreasing, there would\nbe a tendency for the pressure difference between the air\npressure on the top surface and the water pressure inside the\nstone to decrease. However, this tendency will progressively\nreduce as the availability of free water vanishes and negative\npore water pressures are generated inside the stone. At the\nsame time, at the base of the stone, the pressure difference\nbetween the atmospheric air pressure and the water pressure\ninside the stone is increasing. This could lead to water\nrearrangement within the porous stone of the triaxial, poten-\ntially increasing suction even more. While this might explain\nthe descending part of the curves it does not explain the\nascending parts.\nThere is also the possibility that the sample dried during\nunloading; however, this is unlikely to have any effect,\nbecause pore air pressure is changed rapidly (in a few\nseconds) so there would be no time for the sample to dry.\nNevertheless, it could be that drying during the equalisation\nperiods between pressure drops has an effect on the follow-\ning pressure reduction phase.\nDISCUSSION\nThe previous sections have discussed aspects of the\nindividual direct and indirect methods of calibrating tensi-\nometers in the negative range. They have assumed that\nextrapolation from the positive range is acceptable in order\nto observe features of the tests in isolation, and to express\nresults in terms of pressures. In the following we shall\ncompare these methods of obtaining a calibration factor with\nextrapolation, now working in terms of the raw output from\nthe tensiometer, the d.c. voltage.\nTechnique selection\nThe results in previous sections indicate that, from a\npractical point of view, the isotropic unloading method of\nchecking extrapolation for tensiometer calibration is most\nsuitable and, while slightly more complicated to carry out,\nprovides fewer disadvantages than the axis-translation meth-\nod.\nFigure 12 shows plots of the applied target negative\npressures (i.e. not the estimated pressures measured by the\ntensiometer using the extrapolation of the positive calibra-\ntion curve to the negative pressure range) against tensi-\nometer transducer output voltages for the three methods\ndescribed above. For isotropic unloading the imposed values\nwere corrected by Bl. Also shown is the regression line\nextrapolated from the positive range for the \u2018isotropic\u2019\ncalibration. All results shown here use the same tensiometer\n(including the positive extrapolation), but are different from\nthe results discussed in previous sections (which used a\ndifferent tensiometer). Table 4 shows the calibration factors\nfor the three methods used in the negative range, and\ncompares them with the assumption of extrapolation from\nthe positive range using an error measure similar to equation\n(1) in terms of m. While the vacuum method is clearly the\nbest, it has limited use for high-suction tensiometers, and\nthe isotropic unloading method appears to be optimal.\nThe high sensitivity of the axis-translation technique to\nthe presence of water in the porous stone underneath the\nsample is an indication that it probably should not be used\nto calibrate tensiometers in the negative range. Isotropic\nunloading and the vacuum method give smaller errors and\nseem to be less dependent on external factors. It also\nsuggests that calibration in the positive range with extrapola-\ntion to the negative could be accurate enough, but only if\nthe tensiometer is calibrated in the same conditions as those\nin which it will be used.\nApplication of these results to other tensiometers might\nnot be straightforward because of design differences among\ntensiometers. Differences in dimensions, materials, sealants\nand construction would certainly affect the calibration in\nboth the positive and negative pressure ranges, as forces\nwould be transmitted differently through the body. For\ninstance, tensiometers developed by Tarantino & Mongiovi\n(2003) and Ridley et al. (2003) have the diaphragm embo-\ndied in the casing as a single piece, whereas Guan &\nFredlund (1997) and Lourenc\u00b8o et al. (2006) have tensi-\nometers with separate transducers that are glued or fixed to\nthe casing. It is therefore advisable that at least one calibra-\ntion in the negative range is carried out.\nFast assessment of calibration\nA good indication of the accuracy of the calibration is\ngiven by the pressure the tensiometer reads immediately\n\u00026000\n\u00025000\n\u00024000\n\u00023000\n\u00022000\n\u00021000\n0\n\u0002500\nPressure: kPa\nTe\nns\nio\nm\net\ner\n r\nea\ndi\nng\n:  \n V\u00b5\nVacuum\nIsotropic unloading\nAxis translation\nExtrapolation from positive\n\u0002100\u0002200 0\u0002300\u0002400\nFig. 12.

If\nthe tensiometer does not give this reading, then there has\nbeen a shift in the calibration, or the calibration is not\ncorrect. Published data on the air-entry characteristics of the\nImperial College tensiometer by Ridley & Wray (1996)\nshow the same response. Cavitation following the measure-\nment of high suctions for one of the tensiometers used in\nthis study is shown in Fig. 13, and an indication of correct\ncalibration can be seen in the very small deviation of the\ntensiometer reading from \u0001100 kPa following cavitation.\nA procedure was also used in this work for assessing any\nhysteresis of the calibration factor at pressures less than\n\u0001100 kPa. This consisted in performing several suction\nmeasurements on the same sample and, after each measure-\nment, removing the tensiometer from the sample and plun-\nging it in water. Fig. 14 shows a good agreement in the\nsuction measured several times on a sandy clayey soil\nsample, and this is an indication that the calibration is not\ndrifting with time.\nCONCLUSION\nTechniques to validate the extrapolation of the calibration\nof high-capacity tensiometers from the positive to the nega-\ntive range have been studied. The tensiometers have been\ncalibrated in the positive pressure range (against a standard\ntransducer in three different ways: in a saturation manifold\nand in a triaxial cell under \u2018isotropic\u2019 and \u2018anisotropic\u2019\nconditions). The results show that calibration in the positive\npressure range using a saturation manifold is sensitive to the\nway the tensiometer is fixed, since the biggest source of\nerror is due to the external forces holding the device in\nplace. The immediate implication is that the calibration\nshould be conducted under the same external force regime\nas will be applied to the body of the tensiometer when it is\nto be used.\nThe extrapolated calibration has then been used to read\napplied target values of suction imposed on soil samples by\nusing two different techniques: the axis-translation technique\nand isotropic unloading. Readings from the tensiometer have\nalso been compared against known values of negative pres-\nsure (down to \u0001100 kPa), which have been directly imposed\non the tensiometer by using a vacuum pump. The extrapo-\nlated calibration curve appeared to provide suction measure-\nments that are consistent with the target suction values\nimposed by the isotropic unloading technique and by appli-\ncation of vacuum. For isotropic unloading allowance has to\nbe made for a value of the pore pressure parameter B that\nmay not equal unity. If this is allowed for, calibration errors\nwere less than 0.81%. The axis-translation technique seems\nto be the least suited for validating the extrapolation of the\ncalibration equation to the negative range, as it is strongly\ndependent on the water conditions of the underlying porous\nstone.\nLong-term monitoring of the use of tensiometers shows\nthat calibration changes do occur with time or with use. This\nis seen as a non-zero value at the end of a test when the\ntensiometer is submerged in free water. These calibration\nshifts occur in the negative pressure range but not in the\npositive pressure range. The variations are generally low\n(about 5 kPa), and are likely to pose a problem only if the\ntensiometer is used at low suctions, when such a shift might\nbe significant.\nIt is suggested that differences between tensiometer types\ncould lead to different results from those observed for the\nparticular tensiometer used in this study, so at least one\ncheck on the validity of the extrapolated calibration equation\nshould be done. Isotropic unloading and the direct applica-\ntion of negative pressures down to \u0001100 kPa seem to be the\nbest options for checking whether an extrapolation from the\npositive pressure range is sufficiently accurate for the in-\ntended use.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis research was funded by the Engineering and Physical\nSciences Research Council (EPSRC) of the United Kingdom\nthrough a CASE research grant.
