Dmitrii G. Luchinsky was born in Moscow, Russia, in 1959. He received the B.Sc. degree in physics from Moscow State University (Radiophysics Division), Russia, in 1983, and the Ph.D. degree from the Russian Research Institute for Metrological Service (VNIIMS), Moscow, Russia, in 1990. He is currently an Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Research Associate, on leave-of-absence from his permanent position as Senior Scienti\ufb01c Researcher with VNIIMS. He has been a Royal Society Visiting Fellow at Lancaster University, U.K., on three occasions. His research in nonlinear optics has included the invention of a new optically bistable device, the discovery of a new form of optical hysteresis, and the \ufb01rst observation of optical heterodyning noise-protected with stochastic resonance. He has made numerous contributions to the understanding of topics in stochastic nonlinear dynamics, including stochastic resonance and large rare \ufb02uctuations. Riccardo Mannella was born in Massa, Italy, in 1960. In 1985, he became a Dottore in Fisica of Pisa University, with a dissertation on linear response theory. He received the Ph.D. degree from Lancaster University, U.K., and the Dottorato di Ricerca degree in physics from Pisa University, Italy. He has been a Postdoctoral Research Associate at both Pisa University and Lancaster University, and since 1992, a Researcher in physics at the University of Pisa. His research activities are in the \ufb01eld of nonlinear stochastic physics. Peter V. E. McClintock was born in Omagh, Northern Ireland, in 1940. He received the B.Sc. degree in physics in 1962 and the D.Sc. degree from Queen\u2019s University, Belfast, Ireland. After his D.Phil. research at Oxford University, U.K., on spin\u2013phonon interactions in paramagnetic crystals at very low temperatures, and postdoctoral research on super\ufb02uid helium at Duke University, Durham, NC, he joined Lancaster University, U.K., in 1968, where he is now a Professor of Physics and Head of the Physics Department. His current research interests center on super\ufb02uid helium-4 and stochastic nonlinear dynamics. Dr. McClintock is a Fellow of the Institute of Physics. Nigel G. Stocks received the Ph.D. degree from Lancaster University, Lancaster, U.K., in 1990, in the \ufb01eld of stochastic nonlinear dynamics. After spending three years at Lancaster University on research topics including stochastic resonance and noise-induced linearization, he joined Warwick University, U.K., where he currently holds a Warwick Research Fellowship in the Department of Engineering. His current research interests are in the nonlinear response of periodically driven stochastic systems, including stochastic resonance, and the modeling of the laminar-turbulent transition in \ufb02uid \ufb02ow.

INTRODUCTION\nTHE phenomenon of stochastic resonance (SR) has beenin the news recently, partly on account of its wide\noccurrence in many areas of science. In this paper, we present\na succinct introductory review of SR, discussing its physical\nnature and the insights that can be obtained by treating it as\na linear response phenomenon. We describe how electronic\nexperiments have been making major contributions to the\nunderstanding of SR in systems characterized by static bistable\npotentials, which we will describe as conventional SR. In a\nfollowing companion paper [1], we extend the treatment to\nother forms of SR that arise in seemingly very different kinds\nof systems.\nA. What Is SR?\nSR is commonly said to occur when a weak periodic signal\nin a nonlinear system is enhanced by an increase of the ambient\nnoise intensity; a stronger definition requires that the signal-to-\nnoise ratio (SNR) should also increase. The usual observation\nis that the signal amplitude increases with increasing noise\nintensity, passes through a maximum, and then decreases\nagain. Thus, the general behavior is somewhat similar to a\nconventional resonance curve, but plotting the response as a\nManuscript received April 13, 1999; revised June 7, 1999.

In the strongly nonlinear (large signal\/weak\nnoise) regime, the variation of the response with noise intensity\ncan be more complicated.\nThe SR phenomenon appears to be widespread. After being\nintroduced as a possible explanation of the earth\u2019s ice-age\ncycle [2], [3], SR has subsequently been observed or invoked\nin contexts that include lasers [4]\u2013[7], passive optical systems\n[8]\u2013[11], tunnel diodes [12], a Brownian particle in an optical\ntrap [13], a magnetoelastic ribbon [14], crayfish [15] and rat\n[16] mechanoreceptors, a bistable SQUID (superconducting\nquantum interference device) [17], arrays of SR elements [18],\nion channels [19], magnetic systems [20], the El Nino phenom-\nenon [21], social ills [22], a quantum 2-level system [23], an\narray of coupled bistable systems [24], [25], a system driven by\nquasi-monochromatic (harmonic) noise [26], excitable neurons\n[27], chemical systems [28], [29], and various types of bistable\nelectronic system [30]\u2013[35] modeling e.g., coexisting periodic\nattractors [36], [37], subcritical bifurcations [38], systems with\n1057\u20137130\/99$10.00 \uf8e9 1999 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

There have been\ntwo topical conferences [41], [42], several general scientific\narticles [43]\u2013[46] and topical reviews [47]\u2013[51], one of which\n[50] places SR in its historical context in physics.\nIn bistable systems, the underlying mechanism of SR is\neasily appreciated, and in fact has been known since the work\nof Debye [52] on reorienting polar molecules. In a static\ndouble-well potential with equally deep wells, the effect of an\nadditive low-frequency periodic force is to tilt the wells first\nin one direction and then the other, so that one of the wells\nbecome deeper than the other, in turn. The effect of additive\nnoise is, on average, to induce fluctuational transitions to the\ndeeper well. For very weak noise intensity, there will be, on\naverage, no transitions within a half cycle of the periodic force;\nfor very strong noise intensity, the directions of transitions will\nbe random, virtually unaffected by the periodic force; and for\nan optimum noise intensity, the probability of such transitions\noccurring coherently twice (once in each direction) per full\ncycle of the periodic force will be maximized. Thus, noise\ncan effectively amplify small coordinate variations within one\nof the potential wells, caused directly by the rocking effect\nof the periodic force, to an amplitude corresponding to the\ncoordinate separation of the potential minima\u2014which can be\nmade large.\nB. Diverse Forms of Stochastic Resonance\nSR was originally discussed [2], [3] for a bistable system\nand, for the next several years, it was widely assumed that\nbistability was an essential prerequisite for the phenomenon\nto occur. The perception of SR as a linear response phe-\nnomenon (see Section III-A below) led naturally, however, to\nthe realization that SR can also occur without bistability [53]\nand to observation of the phenomenon in an underdamped,\nmonostable, nonlinear oscillator [54]. In fact, it is well known\nthat the response of a monostable system to signals in certain\nfrequency ranges can be strongly increased by noise, e.g., just\nby raising the temperature. Examples range from currents in\nelectron tubes to optical absorption near absorption edges in\nsemiconductors. For underdamped oscillators, a temperature-\ninduced shift and broadening of the absorption peaks, i.e.,\n\u201ctuning\u201d by external driving due to the oscillator nonlinearity,\nwas first discussed by Ivanov et al. [55]; complete classical\nand quantum theories of these effects were given by Dykman\nand Krivoglaz [56].\nSome nonconventional forms of SR, including monostable\nSR, were reviewed in [57]. Since then, forms of SR without\nbistability have been identified in a system with a cyclic\nvariable [58], a class of systems where the signal is applied\nas a multiplicative force [59], and thresholdless systems\n[60]. SR in a monostable SQUID model has recently been\nshown [61] to meet a fortiori even the stronger of the above\ndefinitions: the observed noise-induced SNR enhancements\nwere comparable both in magnitude and form with those\nof conventional SR. We return to nonconventional SR in the\ncompanion paper [1], where we consider specific examples\nof such phenomena in detail.\nIn the next section, we describe the use of circuit models\nfor the study of SR. In Section III, we outline the theory of\nconventional SR. In Section IV, we discuss how the theory has\nbeen tested by circuit modeling, and in Section V, we draw\nconclusions.\nII. CIRCUIT MODELLING OF SR\nAnalytic theories of stochastic phenomena often involve\napproximation, so it is important to find independent means\nof testing and validating them. One approach that has been\nfound to be of great value in practice is based on analog\nelectronic experiments [62]. The aim here is to build an\nelectronic model of the system in which the occurrence of SR\nhas been inferred theoretically, and then to study its properties\nunder appropriate conditions, usually while being driven by\nrandon fluctuations (noise) and a periodic force. Quantitative\nmeasurements are made for comparison with the predictions\nof the (usually) approximate analytic theory. In this section,\nwe briefly review the basic principles of circuit design, discuss\nthe noise-generators used for producing the necessary driving\nnoise, and outline the steps to be taken in analysing the\nsignal(s) coming from the circuit model.\nA. Circuit Design\nThe workhorse of non-VLSI analog circuit design still\nremains the operational amplifier. For present purposes, it\nenables most of the arithmetic operations needed to model\nthe equations of interest to be effected in a very convenient\nand economical fashion [63]. Although addition, subtraction,\nmultiplication\/division by a constant factor, integration, and\ndifferentiation are easily implemented with operational ampli-\nfiers, it is usual to employ specialized integrated circuits (IC\u2019s)\nor devices for certain other operations. In particular:\n\u2022 Multiplication of two voltages is most conveniently\nperformed by use of an analog multiplier IC, e.g., the\nAnalog Devices AD534 or the Burr-Brown MPY-100.\nThe operation of these differential input IC\u2019s in multiplier\nmode can be as sketched in Fig. 2(a), for which\n(1)\nwhere the scale factor is used to prevent the product\nvoltage exceeding the specified maximum. The default\nvalue can be adjusted to suit particular situations.\nIn what follows, multipliers will often be shown in circuit\nblock-diagrams as though their inputs were single-ended\n(rather than differential). In such cases, the appropriate\ninput terminals are chosen so as to provide the desired\nsign of product at the output, and the other terminal of\neach pair is earthed.\n\u2022 Division of two voltages can be performed using the same\nmultiplier IC\u2019s, but connecting the output back into one\nof the inputs as shown in Fig. 2(b), in which case\n(2)\n\u2022 Trigonometric functions can be implemented by use of\ne.g., the Analog Devices AD639 universal trigonometric\nconverter IC, which can be connected to transform the\ninput voltage into its sine, cosine, tangent, cosecant,\nsecant, cotangent, or their inverse functions; e.g., it can\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

Obviously, a cosine can be generated\nby setting either or to 90 . A range of 500\nis accommodated, but can effectively be extended where\nnecessary by use of an analog multiplier IC to generate\nthe double angle (see [1, Section II-B).\n\u2022 General functions can be created by use of a hybrid ana-\nlog\/digital device, as sketched in Fig. 2(d). The required\nfunction is held in the erasable programmable read-only\nmemory (EPROM) as a look-up table. The input voltage\nis digitized by the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and\nused to look up the corresponding number in the EPROM,\nwhich is then converted to a voltage at the output by the\ndigital-to-analog converter (DAC). Devices of this kind\nhave been used e.g., to create trigonometric functions\n[64] (before the corresponding converter IC\u2019s had become\navailable), and for creating the potential corresponding\nto a one-dimensional (1-D) quantum-mechanical binary\nalloy [65]. The period of the clock used to drive the\ndevice must, of course, be very much shorter than all\ncharacteristic times in the system under study.\nIn assembling these circuit elements to model a given\nequation or system of equations, there are several points to\nbe borne in mind.\n1) To minimize extraneous noise introduced by the circuit\nitself, the design should minimize the number of active\ncomponents [66].\n2) Care must, of course, be taken to ensure that the voltage\nlimits for the various components are not exceeded, even\nwhen external forces are driving the circuit far from its\nstationary state.\n3) At the same time, care must also be taken to ensure\nthat the signal is at all points in the circuit larger\n(preferably much larger) than the background noise and\ndrift produced by the circuit itself. This requirement,\ntaken with the preceding one, limits the dynamic range\nof the analog technique to 2 10 . With careful circuit\ndesign, this is more than sufficient for most purposes.\n4) To speed up data acquisition, it is normal to scale time\nin such a way that time in the model effectively runs\nmuch faster than real time. In doing so, care must of\ncourse be taken to ensure all components remain within\ntheir allowed frequency limits or slew-rates.\n5) As usual, connections should be made as short and direct\nas possible to reduce the effect of stray capacitance.\nWhere a circuit model is likely to be needed for many\ndifferent applications, or where particular stability is\nneeded, it is worth designing and fabricating a printed\ncircuit board (PCB). In most cases, however, a simple\nmounting board into which the components can be\ninserted (with pressure contacts) is sufficient.\n6) It is usually best to choose resistor values within (or not\ntoo far outside) the range 10\u2013100 k , and capacitance\nvalues of at least 100 pF in view of the typical stray\ncapacitance of a few picofarads.\nOptimization of the design requires that all of the above cri-\nteria should be taken into account, but some degree of compro-\nmise between them is usually necessary in practice. Minimiza-\ntion of the number of active components can often be achieved\nby making judicious combinations (in single circuit elements)\nof the separate arithmetic operations described above.\nTo see how a circuit model can be designed in practice,\nwe now consider a particular example: the underdamped\nsingle-well Duffing oscillator [67] used [37] for experiments\non supernarrow spectral peaks and high frequency stochastic\nresonance in a system with co-existing periodic attractors (see\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

Block diagram of analog electronic circuit modeling an underdamped single-well Duffing oscillator (4) [37].\nSection II-A of [1]). The equation to be modeled is\n(4)\nwhere the oscillator is driven by a periodic force of amplitude\n, frequency , and is zero-mean white Gaussian noise\nof intensity such that\n(5)\nHere, represents the average of and\nits correlation function.\nThe circuit used to model (4) is shown in Fig. 3; two inte-\ngrators are needed because of the inertial term. The periodic\nforce in the dashed box is set to zero for present purposes (but\nit will be needed in [1, Section II-A] in the discussion of high-\nfrequency stochastic resonance in the same system). We use\nsuperscript primes to distinguish times and frequencies in the\ncircuit (in units of seconds and hertz) from the corresponding\ndimensionless times and frequencies that appear in (4). To\nunderstand the relationships between quantities in the circuit\nand in (4), we sum the currents at point A, and those at point\nB, and we equate them to zero in each case (using Kirchhoff\u2019s\nlaw and the assumption of infinite input impedance of an\noperational amplifier). For point A\n(6)\nand at point B\n(7)\nUsing (7) to substitute for in (6), we obtain\n(8)\nThe component values used in the circuit were\nk\nM\nnF\nThus, (8) may be written\n(9)\nwhere\n(10)\nIt can be seen, therefore, that with the transformations\n(11)\n(9) goes over into (4) with and . Note that the\nmultiplication of by 5 (Fig. 3) is used to prevent the\nterm being too small compared to background noise and\nvoltage offsets in the circuit, following the additional scaling\nby 0.1 in the second multiplier. The relatively large value of\nM was used to obtain a small value of the damping\nconstant . Under these circumstances, it is better to measure\nquantities like and for the completed circuit [68], treating\nit as an experimental object in its own right, rather than just\ncalculating them from component values; the measured and\ncalculated values typically agree to within 10%.\nB. Noise Generators\nExperiments are often undertaken to model systems driven\nby white noise. In reality, of course, white noise\u2014with zero\ncorrelation time and thus a power spectrum that remains\nflat up to infinite frequency\u2014is an idealization. Noise in\nreal physical systems always has a finite correlation time,\nand correspondingly a roll-off in the power spectrum above\nsome characteristic frequency. Provided that the correlation\ntime of the noise is much smaller (e.g., by a factor of\n30) than all characteristic times (the vibration period(s) for\nan underdamped system, or the relaxation time(s) for an\noverdamped one), the noise can be considered quasi-white and\nits effects will be indistinguishable from those of white noise\nwith the same intensity.\nA number of commercial noise generators have been used\nfor experiments in stochastic nonlinear dynamics. These have\nincluded the Quan-Tech model 420 (no longer manufactured)\nand, more recently, the Wandel and Goltermann1 model\n1Wandel u.

Block diagram of the linear-feedback shift-register digital noise-generators used at Lancaster [74], based on a design developed at the University\nof Pisa [66], [69], [70]. Pseudorandom dichotomous (2-level) pulse sequences are generated by the 41-stage feedback shift-register SR2. The high-cut filter\nconverts this dichotomous noise to an output that is Gaussian and exponentially correlated, with a correlation time R2C2. The first feedback shift-register\nSR1 pseudorandomly inverts the sign of the feedback in SR2, thereby eliminating skewness of the distribution. An additional 41-stage feedback shift-register\nSR3 (not shown), taking its invertinginput from stage-9 of SR1 but otherwise connected exactly like SR2, provides a second independent noise source.\nFF is a flip-flop that divides the 4-MHz clock frequency by a factor of 32, and X1\u2013X4 are exclusive-OR gates. The low-frequency cutoff, determined\nby R1C1; is fixed at \u00181 Hz, and the high-frequency cutoff is adjustable. The output noise finally passes through a variable-gain operational amplifier\n(not shown) before being applied to an experiment.\nRG1. The latter produces Gaussian noise with a power\nspectrum that is flat to within 0.5 dB up to 108 kHz;\nabove this frequency, there is a very fast roll-off. It possesses\nthe advantage that the output is genuinely random, with\nessentially infinite repetition period.\nFor many purposes, however, a much cheaper and simpler\n\u201chome-made\u201d noise generator will suffice which, in some\nrespects, is actually superior. This is the device used and\ndescribed by Faetti et al. [69], [70] and Fronzoni [66]. It is\nbased on the generation of a pseudorandom sequence by a\nlinear-feedback shift-register [71]; the dichotomous (two-state)\noutput is then filtered through a Miller integrator to produce\n[72] Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck (i.e., exponentially correlated) noise.\nIn its original form, the dichotomous noise suffered from\nasymmetry in that the times spent in the upper and lower states\nwere systematically different on account of the OR-feedback\nbeing used [73]. Consequently, the distribution function of the\napproximately Gaussian noise created after passage through\nthe filter suffered from significant skewness. Faetti et al.\nshowed [70] that this problem could be overcome by randomly\ninverting the sign of the feedback voltage between EX-OR and\nEX-NOR. A version of this device (Fig. 4) used at Lancaster\n[74] employs the output from two different stages of the same\n17-stage feedback shift register (SR1) as feedback inverters for\ntwo separate 41-stage [75] shift registers (SR2 and SR3). In\nthis way, two independent pseudorandom pulse sequences are\nobtained which, after filtration, provide uncorrelated pseudo-\nwhite noise sources. With a clock frequency of 4 MHz,\nand the filter time constants set to give a cut-off above\n40 kHz, the distribution functions at the output are Gaussian\nto more than 4 standard deviations and the repetition time\nof the pseudorandom time sequences is 6.5 days. It is\nessential to remember that these noise generators should not\nbe used for experiments whose duration exceeds the repetition\ntime; in all other respects, however, they have been found\nentirely satisfactory.\nThe root-mean-square (rms) amplitude of the Ornstein\u2013\nUhlenbeck noise being applied to a circuit model can con-\nveniently be measured with a true rms-to-dc converter such as\nthe Analog Devices AD536A IC. It is then necessary to relate\nthis value (in volts) to the intensity of white noise appearing\nin model equations such as (4) and (5). To do so, we note\nthat Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck noise (e.g., see [76]) is exponentially\ncorrelated, with\n(12)\nwhere is the correlation time. Thus, the mean-square noise\namplitude is\n(13)\nBut the circuit operates in scaled time, so that\n(14)\nwhere is correlation time of the noise (in seconds), which\nis given by the resistance\u2013capacitance (RC) time constant of\nthe Miller integrator used to create it (see above), or can be\nobtained from a measurement of the correlation function of\nthe noise; is the time scaling of the model, given by (11) in\nthe example in Section I-C. Hence\n(15)\nHere, can be measured directly. Values of all the other\nparameters are also known, because they can be calculated\nfrom the component values or measured directly. Thus, (15)\nprovides the required connection between and the rms noise\nvoltage measured by the true rms-to-dc converter IC.\nC.

If fast data acquisition without gaps\u2014coupled with\nintensive processing\u2014is needed, a co-processor is likely to\nbe essential: most of the data processing can then take place\non the card itself, with relatively infrequent transfers of input\ndata and ensemble-averaged distribution to the main memory.\nThe PC\u2019s central processing unit (CPU) thus remains free\nto operate displays of the input and averaged data, interact\nwith the user, and service the \u201chousekeeping\u201d needs of the\noperating system.

Stochastic Resonance as a Linear Response Phenomenon\nWhen it was first discovered, and for some time afterwards,\nSR seemed a rather mysterious phenomenon and a number of\nhighly sophisticated theoretical approaches were proposed (see\ncitations in e.g., the reviews [47]\u2013[49], [51]). Only some years\nlater, it was appreciated [32], [33] that a much simpler formal-\nism\u2014linear response theory (LRT)\u2014would suffice to describe\nwhat was often the most interesting limit in practice, where\nthe signal was relatively small and the noise was relatively\nstrong; an analytic theory of the more complicated effects that\noccur for stronger signal strengths [33], [79], [80], [81] was\nalso developed. Both limits have been explored in considerable\ndetail through analog electronic experiments, validating and\nclarifying the theory. LRT places SR in perspective, enables\nit to be understood in the context of other more familiar\nphenomena in physics [50], and therefore provides the best\nstarting point for understanding SR.\nIf a system with a coordinate is driven by a weak force\nthen, according to LRT [82], a small periodic term\nwill appear in the ensemble-averaged value of the coordi-\nnate oscillating at the same frequency and with\namplitude proportional to that of the force\n(16)\n2Microstar Laboratories Inc., 2265 116th Avenue NE, Bellevue, WA 98004\nUSA; and see http:\/\/www.mstarlabs.com\/. The U.K. distributor is: Amplicon\nLiveline Ltd., Centenary Industrial Estate, Hollindean Road, Brighton BN2\n4AW U.K.\nIn the limit this equation holds for dissipative and\nfluctuating systems that do not display persistent periodic\noscillations in the absence of the force and where the\ncorrelations of fluctuations decay in time. The susceptibility\ncontains all information on the response of the system to\na weak driving force. It gives both the amplitude of the signal\nand its phase lag with respect to the force (and the partial\namplitudes and phase lags for vibrations at the combination\nfrequencies). The theory is readily generalized to the case of\nnonsinusoidal forces, and forces acting under nonequilibrium\nconditions. Provided that the amplitude of the modulation is\nweak enough, the response of the system will always be linear\nand described by (16).\nThe periodic term (16) induced by the force gives rise to a\n-shaped spike in the power spectrum of the coordinate, i.e.,\nin the spectral density of fluctuations (SDF)\n(17)\nat the frequency of the force. The intensity (i.e., the area) of\nthis spike is equal to one fourth of the squared amplitude of\nthe corresponding vibrations, i.e., to . The SNR\ncan thus be written\n(18)\nwhere is the SDF in the absence of the periodic\ndriving. The evolutions of the susceptibility and of\nwith varying noise intensity therefore show immediately\nwhether or not SR (in terms of the strong definition, as an\nincrease in SNR with increasing in a certain range of )\nis to be expected at a given frequency.\nDescribing SR in terms of a susceptibility in this way\nis particularly advantageous for systems that are in ther-\nmal equilibrium, or in quasi-equilibrium. In such cases, the\nKramers\u2013Kronig and fluctuation-dissipation relations [82] can\nbe used to express the susceptibility in terms of\n(19)\n(20)\nwhere denotes the Cauchy principal value and corre-\nsponds to the temperature in energy units. It follows from\n(18)\u2013(20) that it should be possible to predict the onset of\nSR in a given system purely from the evolution of its SDF\nwith noise intensity (temperature), without knowing\nor assuming anything at all about the equations that describe\nits dynamics, i.e., for a system treated as a \u201cblack box.\u201d\nNote that the linear response is obtained as a consequence\nof the noise. The paradigmatic systems that we consider below\nare all highly nonlinear, but their response to a periodic\nforce\u2014which need not necessarily be an extremely weak\none\u2014is linearized in each case by the addition of noise [83]\n(see also [1, Section III-B]) of sufficient intensity.\nB. What Can SR Do and Not Do?\nWe now address the vexed question of whether an SR-\ndisplaying system (a \u201cstochastic resonator\u201d) can be expected\nto improve the SNR of a given signal. There has been much\nconfusion on this point in the literature, with more than one\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

[50] and DeWeese and Bialek [84], using different LRT-\nbased arguments, have pointed out that, for small-amplitude\nsignals, the SNR at the output of a system driven by a\nstationary Gaussian noise does not exceed that at the in-\nput, even if the system displays SR. Indeed, the Fourier\ncomponents of the noise are statistically independent and\nthe total power of the noise in a small spectral\ninterval about the frequency of the signal is small. The\nSNR at the input is given by whereas that at\nthe output is . The\nquantity gives the value of the spectral density of\nfluctuations in the system at frequency as it would be if\nthere was no signal and the spectral components of the noise\nat frequency were suppressed, i.e., as if the power spectrum\nof the input noise had a hole at frequency . By construction\nwhich proves the statement. (In linear systems,\non the other hand, which do not mix frequencies,\nand the SNR at the output must be the same as at the\ninput.) These points deserve, and have recently received [85],\nemphasis given the level of misinformation in some of the\nrecent literature on SR.\nThe situation with large-amplitude signals (beyond the LRT\nrange) is less clear. Generally, such signals are distorted by\na nonlinear system: the response to a sinusoidal signal has\novertones, and therefore may not be characterized by the\nSNR at the signal frequency. In some models, the SR effect\ndecreases with signal amplitude for large signals [86], whereas\nfor specific types of nonlinear systems and signals, and\/or\ndefinitions of the SNR, an increase of the SNR has been\nreported by Kiss [87] and by Khovanov and Anishchenko [88].\nIV. CONVENTIONAL STOCHASTIC RESONANCE IN CIRCUITS\nThe idea that SR might be describable in terms of LRT\nwas tested [32], [33] through analog electronic simulation of\nunderdamped 1-D Brownian motion\n(21)\nin the simple symmetric bistable potential\n(22)\nFig. 6.

The phase shift\u0000\u001e (degrees) between the periodic force of amplitude\nA and the averaged coordinate hx(t)i measured [88] as a function of noise\nintensity D in the electronic model of (22) and (23) for \n = 0:1 andA = 0:04\n(circles); A = 0:2 (squares). The full curve is a theoretical prediction based\non LRT and the fluctuation dissipation theorem.\nthat of the noisy background [30]. These direct measurements\nof the SNR are shown as filled circle data points in Fig. 6.\nSecondly, SDF\u2019s were measured in the absence of the periodic\nforce for several different noise intensities. These\nresults were used to compute the SNR to be expected from\nthe LRT relations (18)\u2013(20), which are shown as open squares\nin the figure. Given that there are no adjustable parameters, the\nagreement between the theory and the direct measurement may\nbe considered an impressive vindication of the LRT approach\nto SR. Of course, the SDF for insertion in (18)\u2013(20)\ndoes not necessarily need to be measured, as here. It can also\nbe calculated analytically over a wide range of parameters\n[89], [90].\nNote that the onset of SR in a bistable system can be\nunderstood in terms of the evolution with of its SDF and,\nin particular, the broadening of the zero-frequency peak [89],\n[90] associated with the interwell fluctuational transitions.\nAs the peak broadens, for finite but small, rises\nexponentially fast. Thus, from (19) and (20), it is clear that\nboth and for will also increase\nexponentially fast. It is clear from (16) and (18) that and\nwill also both increase with . This perception of bistable\nSR is, of course, a counterpart of the picture of noise-enhanced\nhopping between the wells in response to the external driving,\ndiscussed by [52].\nB. Phase-Shift Measurements\nIn close analogy with conventional resonance phenomena, it\nis to be expected that a phase difference will exist in stochastic\nresonance between the periodic driving force and the periodic\nresponse of the system. The magnitude of this phase shift,\nand its variation with noise intensity, was initially a subject of\ncontroversy; the matter was resolved partly through the relative\nsimplicity and transparency of the LRT approach [see (16),\n(19), (20)], and partly through measurements on an analog\nelectronic model of (22) and (23).\nThe phase shift between the force and the response\nwas determined experimentally by measurement of ensemble-\naverages comparing the resultant sinusoid directly with\nthe weak periodic driving force . Results are shown\nby the data points of Fig. 7. It can be seen that, as is\nincreased, starts from a very small value, rises extremely\nfast, passes through a maximum, and then decreases more\nslowly again. A theory able to describe this behavior is readily\nconstructed [91] on the basis of LRT, and leads to the full\ncurve. LRT also provides a satisfactory description of the\nsystem behavior [92], even when has become so large\nthat the SR effect has disappeared, and just decreases\nmonotonically with increasing .\nV. CONCLUSION\nThe successful development of the LRT approach to SR is\nattributable in significant measure to the model experiments\nbased on analog electronic circuits, which enabled the ap-\nproximate analytic theory to be tested while it was being\ndeveloped. As was made clear, LRT provides a very general\nperception of SR and shows that the phenomenon does not\nnecessarily require bistability, or even a static potential, but\nthat it should appear in diverse systems and contexts. We\nconsider some examples of such nonconventional SR in the\ncompanion paper [1].\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors acknowledge, with pleasure, their very consid-\nerable indebtedness to M. I. Dykman, I.
