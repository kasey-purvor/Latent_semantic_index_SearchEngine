Engineers usually rely\neither on empirical observations or on complex finite ele-\nment analysis to predict displacements around tunnels. Rela-\ntively few analytical solutions are available. Sagaseta (1987)\npresented a closed-form solution for obtaining the strain\nfield around a tunnel excavation within an isotropic, homo-\ngeneous, and incompressible material. The soil is modelled\nas a linear-elastic material. This solution is based on fluid\nmechanics concepts. First the effect of the soil surface is\nneglected and the strains due to an assumed sink in an\ninfinite medium are calculated. Then the stresses at the top\nplane representing the soil surface are eliminated by impos-\ning either a virtual source or sink within the infinite medium\nand located in a symmetrical position above the plane. These\nfree surface corrections lead to additional components of\nstrain. Verruijt & Booker (1996) extended Sagaseta\u2019s solu-\ntion for compressible materials and include the effects of\novalisation of tunnel openings. However, it is found that\nVerruijt & Booker\u2019s solution gives a wider surface settlement\nprofile and larger horizontal movements than observed in\npractice. Loganathan & Poulos (1998) modified Verruijt &\nBooker\u2019s solution to give narrower settlement troughs and to\naccount empirically for construction effects.\nIn the analytical solutions mentioned above, the soil is\nmodelled as a linear-elastic material. However, the stress\u2013\nstrain behaviour of soil is non-linear even at very small\nstrains (Jardine et al., 1984; Burland 1989; Houlsby &\nWroth, 1991). Finite element analyses of modelling tunnel\nconstruction of the Jubilee Line Extension (JLE) beneath St\nJames\u2019s Park conducted by Addenbrooke et al. (1997)\nshowed that modelling soil as a linear-elastic material leads\nto inadequate displacement prediction.\nOsman et al. (2006) developed a kinematic plastic solu-\ntion for ground movements around a shallow, unlined, tunnel\nembedded within an undrained clay layer. In this solution,\nthe pattern of deformation around the tunnel is idealised by\na simple plastic deformation mechanism (Fig. 1). Within the\nboundaries of the deformation mechanism, the soil deforms\ncompatibly, following a Gaussian distribution. Outside this\nmechanism the soil is assumed to be rigid. This mechanism\ndoes not incorporate slip surfaces. Osman et al. (2006)\ndemonstrated that the upper bound theorem applied to\ndistributed shearing mechanism offered a reasonable assess-\nment for collapse, and also matches the displacement field\nobserved in centrifuge tests of tunnel failure in clay (Mair,\n1979). It was also demonstrated that the shape of the surface\nsettlement profile remained the same as the magnitude of\nsettlement increased towards failure. In this paper it will be\ndemonstrated that an upper bound style of calculation is also\ncapable of predicting ground displacements at any stage\nprior to failure, representing the soil as a strain-hardening\nplastic material.\nManuscript received 18 April 2006; revised manuscript accepted 21\nSeptember 2006.\nDiscussion on this paper closes on 1 May 2007, for further details\nsee p. ii.\u0001\nSchool of Engineering, Durham University, UK.\ny Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, UK.\nDEFORMATION MECHANSIM\nThe vertical displacements of the ground surface above a\ntunnel can be represented by a Gaussian curve (Peck, 1969;\nMair & Taylor, 1997), and this is consistent with a consider-\nable amount of field data. The vertical displacements in the\ndeformation mechanism (Fig. 1) proposed by Osman et al.\n(2006) are taken to follow a Gaussian distribution on each\nsuccessive horizontal plane at depth z below the surface.\nThe distance to the point of inflexion iz is then expressed by\niz \u00bc Kzzo (1)\nwhere\nKz \u00bc 0:5 1 \u0002 z\nzm\n\u0001 \u0002\u00c6\n(2)\nwhere zo is the depth of the tunnel centre below the ground\nsurface, zm is the depth below the ground surface of the\npoint of intersection of the extension of the boundary ac\n(and bd) with the vertical centreline of the tunnel, and\nexponent \u00c6 is taken to be a constant.\nAt the ground surface, Kz\u00bc0 \u00bc 0.5, which is consistent\nwith a large number of case histories (Rankin, 1988; Mair &\nTaylor, 1997).\nThe vertical displacement v is therefore given by\n\u0001 \u00bc Asm\n2Kz\nexp \u0002 1\n2\nx\niz\n\u0001 \u00022\" #\n\u0002 exp \u0002 B\n2\n2\n\u0001 \u0002( )\n(3)\nand the horizontal displacement u is given by\nu \u00bc \u0002 \u00c6Asmx\n2Kz zm \u0002 z\u00f0 \u00de exp \u0002\n1\n2\nx\niz\n\u0001 \u00022\" #\n\u0002 exp \u0002 B\n2\n2\n\u0001 \u0002( )\n(4)\nwhere A and B are constants.\nEquations (3) and (4) satisfy the incompressibility condi-\ntion\n@u\n@x\n\u00fe @\u0001\n@z\n\u00bc 0 (5)\nThe total half-width of the surface settlement trough is\nassumed to be 2.5i (Mair et al., 1993), and the soil outside\nthe mechanism is assumed to be stationary, with the maxi-\nmum surface settlement sm occurring at the tunnel centreline\n(z \u00bc 0, x \u00bc 0). By satisfying these boundary conditions, it\ncan be shown that B takes the value 2.5 and A takes the\nvalue 1.046.\nHYPOTHESIS\nIn order to avoid the complex 3D moving-boundary\nproblem of real tunnel excavation at a face, the mechanism\nto be developed here will be based on plane-strain cavity\ncontraction (Fig. 1). Here, the cylindrical cavity representing\nthe future tunnel is \u2018wished into place\u2019 and kept open\ninitially by an interior support pressure \u0002T, which is taken as\nthe pre-existing vertical stress in the ground at the elevation\nof the tunnel axis. Tunnel excavation is then simulated in\nplane strain by steadily reducing \u0002T and by monitoring the\nreduction in the area of the cavity. The mechanical effi-\nciency of a tunnelling operation is usually measured in term\nof volume loss VL, expressed as the volume of extra material\nexcavated divided by the intended volume of the tunnel, and\nexpressed as a percentage. When tunnelling in undrained\nclay, this volume loss is available as the source of a\nsettlement trough expressed at the ground surface.\nThe total displacements around circular tunnels in working\nconditions are idealised by the deformation mechanism\nshown in Fig. 1. The tunnel support pressure \u0002T correspond-\ning to a certain volume loss can be calculated from the total\nenergy balances of the work dissipated in distributed shear,\nthe potential energy loss of soil flowing into the tunnel, and\nthe work done by the soil against the tunnel support pressure\nand on the soil by any surface surcharge pressure \u0002S,\u00f01:25zo\n\u00021:25zo\n\u0002S \u0002 \u0002T\u00f0 \u00de\u0001z\u00bc0dx \u00fe\n\u00f0\nArea\n\u00aa\u0001dArea \u00bc\n\u00f0\nArea\nt\u0003sdArea\n(6)\nwhere t is the shear strength mobilised under working\nconditions, and equal to half the difference between the\nmajor and the minor principal stresses; \u0002T is the tunnel\nsupport pressure; \u0002S is the surcharge pressure at the ground\nsurface; Area is the area of the displacement mechanism\nshown in Fig. 1; and \u0003s is the engineering shear strain,\ndefined as the difference between major and minor principal\nstrain (the expression for \u0003s is given in Appendix 2).\nThe energy calculations given by equation (6) depend on\nthe geometry of the deformation mechanism of Fig. 1. An\niteration on the exponent \u00c6, which governs the width of the\ndeformation mechanism (equation (2)), and on the depth zm\nneeds to be carried out in the spirit of upper bound plasticity\nanalysis, to find the critical values that maximise the\nrequired tunnel support for any given volume loss. During\ntunnel construction, of course, the unsupported heading can\nget the additional benefit of 3D arching, which will reduce\nthe required tunnel support pressure below the 2D calcula-\ntion that is currently being developed.\nCALCULATION METHOD\nChange of tunnel geometry during construction\nAnalytically, a reduction of tunnel support pressure creates\na reduction in tunnel diameter. In real tunnel construction\nthe extra material is removed at the face. In the physical\nmodel tests that can be used to calibrate an emerging analy-\nsis, it is more convenient simply to monitor the reducing\ntunnel diameter. In this latter case, however, the stability of\nthe tunnel is enhanced by the increasing cover\/depth ratio,\nand it may be necessary to allow for this change of\ngeometry in the analysis of large volume losses occurring in\nthe physical model.\nIt is proposed to validate the new 2D analysis using\ncentrifuge models constructed at 1g, and supported by\ncompressed air at enhanced gravity prior to the compressed\nair pressure being reduced until the tunnel collapses. In this\ncase, a large volume loss is recorded as the tunnel diameter\nreduces, and a first-order correction for this finite deforma-\n\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0002\u0002\n\u0002\u0003\u0002\u0004\n\u0005 \u0006\n\u0001\u0007 \u0003\n\u0004\n\b\n\t\n\u000b\u0005\nFig. 1. Plastic deformation mechanism for tunnels in clay\n598 OSMAN, BOLTON AND MAIR\ntion must be incorporated. The equivalent diameter Df of\nthe tunnel (Fig. 2) after each increment of relative volume\nloss VL is assumed to be given by\nDf \u00bc D\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n(1 \u0002 VL)\np\n(7)\nwhere D is the initial diameter of the tunnel.\nThe relative volume loss VL is calculated in practice (Mair\net al., 1993) by\nVL \u00bc\nffiffiffiffiffiffi\n2\u0004\np\nism\n\u0004D2=4\n(8)\nCentrifuge models conducted by Mair (1979) showed signifi-\ncant inward displacements occurring at the tunnel crown and\nshoulders, whereas a much smaller movement was observed at\nthe tunnel invert. The proposed plastic mechanism shown in\nFig. 1 implies zero displacement at the tunnel invert. Therefore\nit is assumed that the location of the invert is fixed and that the\ncross-section remains circular, as shown in Fig. 2. The centri-\nfuge tests could continue even beyond a volume loss of 50%,\nbecause the reduction in tunnel diameter also increases the\nstability of the remaining cavity, as will be explained below.\nTunnel excavations that create more than 5% volume loss\nmight be regarded as problematic in practice.\nCalculation steps\nThe calculations are carried out in steps of small volume\nloss, after each of which the tunnel geometry is updated.\nThe equivalent diameter of the tunnel at the beginning of\nthe step is calculated from the volume loss at the end of the\nprevious step using equation (7). The incremental volume\nloss in the next step is then imposed and the corresponding\nground displacements are then calculated. Displacements are\ndifferentiated to obtain strains, and the new value of maxi-\nmum shear strain is calculated at every point within the\ndeformation mechanism. Mobilised shear stress can then be\nread off a representative shear stress\u2013strain curve. The\nrequired tunnel support pressure is then calculated from the\nwork equation (equation (6)) by balancing the internal\ndissipation in distributed shear and the work done against\nthe tunnel supporting pressure, against the work done by the\nsurface surcharge and gravity. The calculations are repeated\nfor different mechanism parameters of \u00c6 and zm to find the\nmaximum required value of tunnel support pressure. This is\ntaken as the best available estimate, in the spirit of upper\nbound plasticity calculations.\nVALIDATION\nThe proposed calculation method is validated by compar-\ning its predictions with the results of five centrifuge tests\nconducted by Mair (1979) using the 8 m diameter Cam-\nbridge Geotechnical Centrifuge. Table 1 summarises the\ncentrifuge tests used in the back-analysis, and Fig. 3 shows\nthe soil conditions in these tests. Model tunnels were\nconstructed in soft clay and tested at accelerations of 75g\nand 125g to establish the internal consistency of the method.\nThe clay in test 2DH has constant undrained shear strength\nwith depth. In the other tests, the clay was brought into\nequilibrium in the centrifuge in an overconsolidated state\nwith a high groundwater table so that the undrained strength\nincreased with depth. In each test, compressed air equal to\nthe total overburden pressure at tunnel axis level was used to\nsupport the tunnel as the centrifuge acceleration was applied,\nand was then reduced incrementally to simulate tunnel\nexcavation.

Conditions for tunnel model in Series II (Mair, 1979)\nPREDICTING 2D GROUND MOVEMENTS AROUND TUNNELS IN UNDRAINED CLAY 599\nStress\u2013strain response\nFigure 4 shows the direction of principal strain for differ-\nent soil elements around a tunnel in undrained clay observed\nin a 1g experiment conducted by Seneviratne (1979). In\nlocations above the tunnel crown, and along its vertical\ncentreline, the direction of principal strain is horizontal,\nwhich resembles the conditions in plane-strain extension\ntests. The principal strains in the elements at the tunnel sides\nare vertical, which resembles the conditions in plane-strain\ncompression tests. Fig. 5(a) shows the results of one-dimen-\nsionally consolidated undrained plane-strain compression and\nextension tests for samples of spestone kaolin clay, which\nwas very similar to the speswhite kaolin clay used in the\ncentrifuge tests listed in Table 1. The plane-strain soil tests\nwere conducted by Sketchley (1973). The stress\u2013strain\ncurves are plotted as shear stress t normalised by the mean\neffective consolidation stress s9c. Fig. 5(a) shows behaviour\nthat is typical for normally and lightly overconsolidated\nmaterials. In compression, the shear stress reaches a peak\nvalue at a shear strain of 6\u20138%. In contrast, the peak shear\nstress in extension was mobilised at a much larger shear\nstrain (18\u201322%). These stress\u2013strain responses, plotted as\nnormalised shear strength (t\/su) against shear strain \u0003s, are\nshown in Fig. 5(b) together with representative stress\u2013strain\ncurves used in the back-analysis. These curves are taken to\nrepresent the possible bounds of the stress\u2013strain response\nin the experiments. Simple power curves are used to model\nstress\u2013strain response (Gunn, 1993):\nt\nsu\n\u00bc \u0003s\n\u0003s,f\n\u0001 \u0002\u0005\n(9)\nFrom the stress\u2013strain data shown in Fig. 5(b), the exponent\n\u0005 is taken to be 0.15 for compression and 0.5 for extension,\nand the shear strain at the maximum shear strength, \u0003s,f , is\ntaken to be 8% and 18% for compression and extension\nrespectively. Large-strain behaviour is assumed to be per-\nfectly plastic.\nSurface settlement profile\nFigure 6 shows observed and calculated maximum mid-\nsurface settlement sm normalised by tunnel diameter, plotted\nagainst reducing tunnel support pressure \u0002T. The solid lines\nshow prediction bounds based on the compression and\nextension stress\u2013strain data of Fig. 5(b). The dotted line\npresents the settlements calculated from the average of the\nplane extension and compression data. An example demon-\nstrating the calculation is shown in Appendix 1.\nFigure 6 shows that these calculations, assuming isotropic\nsoil behaviour and using either plane-strain extension or\nplane-strain compression data, do indeed offer bounds for\nthe predicted surface settlements of shallow tunnels (tests\n2DH, 2DP and 2DT). The average settlement curve plotted\nby taking the average values of the calculated settlement\nbased on extension and compression data conforms reason-\nably to the measured data. The discrepancy at small settle-\nments might be due to inaccuracy in measuring soil stiffness\nat small strain level in Sketchley\u2019s plane-strain tests. For\ndeeper tunnels, 2DV and 2DU, the method overpredicts the\nsettlement by a factor of roughly 2. Alternatively, the\ncalculation of the tunnel support pressure necessary to\nrestrict settlement to a particular value has been underesti-\nmated by about 20% for the deep tunnels. These deep tunnel\ntests were continued until the original cavity was filled with\nclay. The tendency for stabilisation due to reducing cavity\ndiameter in the later stages of tests 2DV and 2DU is\ncaptured, albeit approximately, by the predictions.\nShear strain contours\nFigure 7(a) shows the shear strain contours for test 2DP at\na volume loss of 42%, and Fig. 8(a) shows the shear strain\nFig. 4 Direction of major principal strains observed in 1g test\non a tunnel model in undrained clay (Seneviratne, 1979)\n\u0013\n\u001e\n\u0013\n\t\n\u0013\n\u0014\n\u0013\n\u0003\u0013\n\u0014\n\u0003\u0013\n\t\n\u0007\u001f\u0006\n\u0001 \u0005\n\u0013 \u000b \u0014\u0013 \u0014\u000b \t\u0013 \t\u000b\n\u0002\u0001\u0017\u0011 \n!\u0002\"\n\u0018\u0019\u001a\u0011\u0001\u0011\u0014\n\u0013\n\u0018\u0019\u001a\u0011\u0001\u0011\u0014\n\u001e\u001d\n\u0018\u0019\u001a\u0011\u0001\u0011\u001e\n\u001d#\n\u0018\u0019\u001a\u0011\u0001\u0011\u0014\n\u0013\n\u0018\u0019\u001a\u0011\u0001\u0011\u0014\n\u001d\u001b\n\u0018\u0019\u001a\u0011\u0001\u0011\u001b\n\u001b\t\n\u0014\n\u0013\n\u0013\n$\n\u0013\n#\n\u0013\n\u001b\n\u0013\n\t\n\u0013\n\u0007\u001f\u0006\n\u001c\n\u0013 \u000b \u0014\u0013 \u0014\u000b \t\u0013 \t\u000b\n\u0002\u0001\u0017\u0011 \n!\b\"\n\u0018\u0019\u001a\u0011\u0001\u0011\u0014\n\u0013\u0011!\u0005\u0003\u0004\u000e%\u0010\u0001\u0001\r\u0003&\"\n\u0018\u0019\u001a\u0011\u0001\u0011\u0014\n\u001e\u001d\u0011!\u0005\u0003\u0004\u000e%\u0010\u0001\u0001\r\u0003&\"\n\u0018\u0019\u001a\u0011\u0001\u0011\u001e\n\u001d#\u0011!\u0005\u0003\u0004\u000e%\u0010\u0001\u0001\r\u0003&\"\n\u0018\u0019\u001a\u0011\u0001\u0011\u0014\n\u0013\u0011!\u0010'\u0015\u0010&\u0001\r\u0003&\"\n\u0018\u0019\u001a\u0011\u0001\u0011\u0014\n\u001d\u001b\u0011!\u0010'\u0015\u0010&\u0001\r\u0003&\"\n\u0018\u0019\u001a\u0011\u0001\u0011\u001b\n\u001b\t\u0011!\u0010'\u0015\u0010&\u0001\r\u0003&\"\n\u001a\u0010\u000e%\u0010\u0001\u0010&\u0015\u0002\u0015\r(\u0010\u0011\u0005\u001c%(\u0010\nFig. 5.

In this section\nan approximate closed-form solution is developed based on\nan assumption of radial symmetry and satisfying the equili-\nbrium condition on the tunnel centreline.\nAssuming radial symmetry, the equilibrium equation for a\nsoil element at the tunnel centreline (Fig. 9) can be ex-\npressed in polar coordinates as\nd\u0002 r\ndr\n\u00fe \u0002 r \u0002 \u0002\u0141\nr\n\u00bc \u0002\u00aa (10)\nwhere r is the radial distance from the tunnel centreline, \u0002r\nand \u0002\u0141 are the stresses in the radial and circumferential\ndirections respectively, and \u00aa is the unit weight of soil.\nThe principal strains are in the radial and circumferential\ndirections, and could be assumed to be given by \u0002v\/r and\nv=r, so the shear strain is given by 2v\/r. This kinematical\nassumption will not be consistent with field observations of\nshallow tunnels. However, the purpose is to obtain a simple\nclosed-form solution.

(17)\nFigure 10 shows the settlement profile predicted by equation\n(17). The extension data are used here, because the major\nprincipal strain direction along the centreline is always\nhorizontal, as shown in Fig. (4). The calculations are carried\nout in steps of 1% volume loss, and the equivalent tunnel\ndiameter is calculated from equation (7). The soil is as-\nsumed to be homogeneous, and the average undrained shear\nstrength above the tunnel is used in the calculations. It\nappears that this simple closed-form solution underestimates\nthe required 2D tunnel support pressure by about 20% for\nshallow tunnels but fits reasonably well with the data of\ndeeper tunnels (C\/D \u00bc 3.11) in the earlier stages of simu-\nlated excavation before overestimating required support by\nabout 10% at a settlement\/diameter ratio of about 10%. The\ndiscrepancy is due mainly to the assumption of a radially\nsymmetrical displacement field. This solution is based on\nhomogeneous soil with constant shear strength.\nCONCLUSION\nThe ground displacements due to tunnelling are idealised\nby a simple plane-strain displacement mechanism. The soil\nis assumed to deform compatibly and continuously following\na Gaussian distributed curve of vertical displacements. The\ncalculations are carried out in steps of small volume loss,\nafter each of which the tunnel geometry can be updated. A\nsimplified expression to account for change of tunnel geo-\nmetry is assumed. The required tunnel support pressure\ncorresponding to a certain volume loss is calculated from a\nwork equation by balancing the work done by gravity, and\nany surface surcharge, against the work done on tunnel\nsupport pressure, and the energy dissipated in distributed\nshearing.

Simplified equilibrium assumption for tunnels\n602 OSMAN, BOLTON AND MAIR\nmaximum required tunnel support pressure, which is ob-\ntained by iterating for a variety of deformation mechanisms\nin the spirit of upper bound limit analyses. Here, however,\nthe calculation is of the tunnel support pressure required to\nlimit ground settlements to given magnitudes.\nThe calculation method is validated by five centrifuge\ntests on plane-strain unlined tunnels in kaolin clay. The\nbehaviour of the clay is simplified by fitting the stress\u2013strain\ndata of biaxial extension and compression tests with simple\npower curves. The observed data appear to be confined\nwithin the predicted range of settlements. The average settle-\nment curves plotted by taking the average values of the\ncalculated settlement based on extension and compression\ndata conform closely to the measured data. However, this\nappears to be conservative for deep tunnels, overpredicting\nthe tunnel support pressure by about 20%.\nThe authors also developed a simple closed-form solution\nfor the prediction of maximum surface ground settlement.\nThis solution is obtained by integrating the equilibrium\nequations along the tunnel centreline from the tunnel cir-\ncumference up to the ground surface and by invoking radial\nsymmetry. A simple power curve was used to model the\nstress\u2013strain relations. These analytical solutions for maxi-\nmum surface settlements have also been validated against\nthe centrifuge test data, and gave close correspondence for\ndeep tunnels but underpredicted tunnel support pressure by\nabout 20% for shallow tunnels (C\/D , 3).\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors acknowledge the support of the Engineering\nand Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC): Platform\nGrant GR\/T 18660\/01.\nAPPENDIX 1. CALCULATIONS ILLUSTRATION\nIn test 2DH (Mair, 1979), the bulk unit weight of the soil is\n15.9 kN\/m3, the cover to depth ratio C\/D is 1.8, the tunnel diameter\nis 60 mm, and the average centrifuge acceleration is 71g. The\nprototype tunnel diameter is therefore 4.26 m and the prototype\ndepth to the tunnel axis zo is 9.78 m. The calculations are carried out\nin small increments of volume loss. The increment size is chosen to\nbe 1%. The potential energy loss and the work dissipated in\ndistributed shear need to be calculated. Let us first assume that the\nmechanism parameters are \u00c6 \u00bc 0.35 and (zm \u0002 zo)\/(D\/2) \u00bc 0.45.\nFrom equation (2), the width parameter i at the ground surface is\nequal to 0.5zo. The maximum mid-surface settlement sm is\ncalculated from the relative volume loss using equation (8):\nsm \u00bc VL\u0004D\n2\n4\nffiffiffiffiffiffi\n2\u0004\np\ni\n\u00bc 1\n100\n3\n\u00043 4:262\n4\nffiffiffiffiffiffi\n2\u0004\np\n0:53 9:78\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 0\n:0116 m\ni is taken to be equal to 0.5zo (equation (1)): thus the maximum mid-\nsurface settlement sm is found to be 0.0116 m.\nIn a soil element located at a depth z of 4 m below the ground\nsurface and a horizontal distance x of 1 m from the centreline, the\nvertical displacement v found from equation (3) is 0.0127 m, which\ngives a potential energy loss per unit volume of 0.2018 kN m. The\nshear strain \u0003s (calculated from the expression given in Appendix 2)\nat the end of the step is 0.0015. At a depth of 4 m the undrained\nshear strength, from Fig. 3, is 20.6 kPa.\nThe pre-peak behaviour is modelled by a simple power curve\nexpressed by equation (9). The internal work per unit volume\ndissipated in the distributed shear zone using the plane extension\ndata curve (\u0005 \u00bc 0.5, \u0003s,f \u00bc 0.18) is therefore\nsu\n\u0005\u00fe 1\n\u0003s\n\u0003s,f\n\u0001 \u0002\u0005\u00fe1\n\u00bc 20\n:56\n1 \u00fe 0:5\n0:0015\n0:18\n\u0001 \u00020:5\u00fe1\n\u00bc 0:002 kNm=m3\nThe integration of the work equation (equation (8)) needs to be\ncarried out for the whole volume of the deformation mechanism of\nFig. 1. The gives \u0002T \u00bc 92 kPa. The values of \u00c6 and zm are iterated\nuntil a maximum value of tunnel support is achieved, which is found\nto be 141.5 kPa.\nAt the end of this step of calculation the equivalent tunnel diameter\nfrom equation (9) will be 4.24 m. The energy calculation is repeated\nin the further steps as requested, with VL \u00bc 2% and D \u00bc 4.24 m, etc.\nAPPENDIX 2.
