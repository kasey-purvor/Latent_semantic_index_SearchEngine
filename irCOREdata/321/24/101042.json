This is in marked contrast with all other\nN \u0001 8 isotones, both more and less exotic than 12Be. The occupancies of the 0@! \u0001p1=2 orbital and the\n1@!, \u0001d5=2 intruder orbital were deduced from a measurement of neutron removal from a high-energy\n12Be beam leading to bound and unbound states in 11Be.\nDOI: 10.1103\/PhysRevLett.96.032502 PACS numbers: 25.60.Dz, 21.60.Cs, 24.10.\u0002i, 27.20.+n\nA principal aim of present day nuclear structure research\nis to understand the evolution of shell structure with in-\ncreasing asymmetry in the neutron-to-proton ratio. In this\ncontext the N \u0001 8 isotonic chain, which spans from 22Si\nvia the doubly magic N \u0001 Z 16O to the two-neutron halo\nsystem 11Li and the unbound 10He, is of considerable\ninterest. Indeed, the N \u0001 8 shell closure, that is clearly\nevident close to stability, disappears amongst the lightest of\nthese nuclei. In particular, the halo structure of 11Li is\nenhanced by a strong \u0001\u00031s1=2\u00042 intruder valence neutron\nconfiguration [1]. Similarly, recent experiments [2\u20135] have\nconfirmed earlier work [6\u20139] in which it was concluded\nthat the 12Be ground state is formed from both the \u2018\u2018nor-\nmal\u2019\u2019 closed shell \u0001\u00030p1=2\u00042 valence configuration and the\nintruder \u0001\u00031s0d\u00042 configurations, with a 10Be\u0003g:s:\u0004 core.\nThe factors producing these intruder configurations appear\nto include a reduction in the p-sd shell gap as the dripline\nis approached, an increase in the monopole pairing energy,\nand deformation [10]. The deformation is also believed to\nbe related to the tendency towards alpha-particle clustering\n[11] in the Be isotopes.\nWhereas high-energy single-neutron removal (or\n\u2018\u2018knockout\u2019\u2019) from 12Be has provided direct evidence for\nconfiguration mixing involving the \u0001\u00031s1=2\u00042 and \u0001\u00030p1=2\u00042\nvalence neutron configurations in the ground-state [3],\nmodel predictions indicate that a substantial \u0001\u00030d5=2\u00042\nadmixture (\u000530%\u201350%) should also be present [10,12\u2013\n15]. In the experiment of Navin et al., 11Be core fragments\nin either the J\u0002 \u0001 1=2\u0006 ground state or the bound 320 keV\n1=2\u0002 excited state were detected [3]. These states have\nlarge overlaps with the pure single-particle states \u0001\u00031s1=2\u0004\nand \u0001\u00030p1=2\u0004, respectively [16,17]. The measurement of\nRef. [3] was, however, not sensitive to the \u0001\u00030d5=2\u00042 com-06=96(3)=032502(4)$23.00 03250ponent as the removal of a 0d5=2 neutron leaves 11Be in the\n\u0001\u00030d5=2\u0004 single-particle state (Ex \u0001 1:78 MeV, \u0001 \u0001\n100 keV) [16,18], which is unbound to neutron emission\nand decays to 10Be\u0003g:s:\u0004 \u0006 n. It is thus necessary to design\nan experiment to detect both the 10Be fragment and the\nneutron and then to reconstruct their relative decay energy\nfrom the measured momenta. This was the approach\nadopted in the present work. Further, to assist comparisons\nwith theory and the earlier work, the ability to detect 11Be\nin the first excited state (via the 320 keV \u0003 ray) was\nincluded.\nA secondary beam of 12Be (\u00055000 pps) was prepared\nusing the LISE3 spectrometer at GANIL from the reaction\nof a 63 MeV=A 18O beam on 9Be. The average 12Be beam\nenergy was 39:3 MeV=A at the center of the carbon sec-\nondary reaction target (183 mg=cm2). The beam purity\nwas 95%, with the remaining 5% being 6He and 15B.\nOwing to the poor emittance of the secondary beam, the\nspot size on target was \u000510 mm diameter and the incident\nions were tracked event by event using two position-\nsensitive drift chambers located upstream of the carbon\ntarget. The point of impact was thus determined to within\n&1 mm at the target. The measured time-of-flight through\nthe LISE spectrometer allowed 12Be ions to be selected\nuniquely event by event and provided a measure of the\nenergy, with a resolution of 1.6% (FWHM).\nA telescope subtending \u00079\b in the horizontal (x) and\nvertical (y) planes recorded charged particles emerging\nfrom the carbon target close to 0\b, including the unreacted\nbeam. This was composed of two 50\t 50 mm2 500 \u0004m\nthick Si strip detectors to measure energy loss (\u0002E1;2),\nfollowed by a 4\t 4 array of 16 CsI stopping detectors\n(E) 25 mm thick [19].

From this, the cross section\nshown in Table I was deduced for 11Be in the first excited (1=2\u0002)\nstate.\nPRL 96, 032502 (2006) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending27 JANUARY 2006\n\u2018\u2018cocktail\u2019\u2019 beams containing all relevant isotopes of Be, at\nseveral spectrometer settings to span the energies of inter-\nest. Using \u0002E1;2 and E, all observed isotopes of H, He, Li,\nBe, and B were clearly resolved. The Si detectors provided\nx and y position measurement which, combined with the\ndrift chamber data, determined the scattering angle with a\nresolution 0.7\b (FWHM).\nCoincident \u0003 rays were recorded using 4 NaI detectors\nmounted around the target at angles of \u000745\b and \u0007110\b to\nthe beam, with a total absolute photopeak efficiency of\n3.5% for detection of Doppler-shifted 320 keV \u0003 rays.\nNeutrons were detected using the DEMON array of 91\nliquid scintillator modules [20] located between 2.4 m and\n6.3 m downstream of the carbon target and spanning angles\nout to 32\b [21]. Neutrons were distinguished from \u0003 rays\nusing standard pulse-shape discrimination and their ener-\ngies (En) were derived via the time of flight with a resolu-\ntion \u00055%. Neutrons with En \n 15 MeV, originating from\nthe target, were excluded in the analysis.\nThe background arising from 12Be beam particles that\nreacted in the telescope was determined by acquiring data\nwith no target, with the beam energy lowered to account\nfor the energy loss in the target [21]. Such events gave\ndegraded energy signals, and could be misidentified as\n11Be or 10Be. This background precluded an accurate\nmeasurement of the yield to the 11Be ground state [22].\nFor the excited states, coincident detection of a \u0003 ray or\nneutron reduced substantially the background (to 50% and\n60% of the target-in data, respectively).\nThe background-subtracted, Doppler-corrected \u0003-ray\nspectrum, in coincidence with 11Be ions in the tele-\nscope, is shown in Fig. 1. The cross section for production\nof the 1=2\u0002 state in 11Be (see Table I) was extracted after\naccounting for the experimentally measured \u0003-ray detector\nefficiencies, attenuation in the target, and the relativistic\nfocussing of \u0003 rays in the laboratory frame (\u0005 \u2019 0:28).\nThe cross section measured here at 39:3 MeV=nucleon\nis compatible with the value measured previously at\n78 MeV=nucleon with a Be target [3], as interpreted below\nusing an eikonal reaction model. The longitudinal momen-\ntum distribution of the 11Be\u000b\u00031=2\u0002\u0004 fragments was also\nmeasured, giving a FWHM of 137\u000321\u0004 MeV=c, in agree-\nment with \u0005150 MeV=c estimated from Ref. [3].\nThe measured momenta of coincident 10Be ions and\nneutrons were used to kinematically reconstruct unbound\nstates in 11Be. The procedure was verified [22] by recon-\nstructing the well-known ground-state resonance of 7He\nfrom 6He\u0006 n coincidences. The relative energy (Erel)\nspectrum for 10Be\u0006 n, after background subtraction, is\nshown in Fig. 2, which is corrected for the intrinsic effi-\nciency of the DEMON detectors but not for the geometrical\nacceptance. A peak is clearly evident at \u00051:3 MeV, cor-\nresponding to the decay of the 1.78 MeV (5=2\u0006) state in\n11Be. There is also another peak apparent near 2.2 MeV,\ncorresponding to decay of the 2.69 MeV (3=2\u0002) state [23].03250The very narrow peak near threshold is compatible with\ndecay from a state at \u00054:0 MeV in 11Be to the first 2\u0006 state\nin 10Be at 3.37 MeV. The ground-state branch of this decay\ncorresponds to the peak at Erel \u0005 3:5 MeV; its inclusion\nimproves the fit, but the magnitude of neither peak is well\ndefined by the data. However, good candidates exist for\nsuch a state in 11Be [18,24].\nThe detection efficiency for neutrons from 11Be\u000b decay\nis determined partly by their laboratory angular distribu-\ntion, which depends on the decay energy to 10Be\u0006 n and\nthe spread in momentum induced by the initial neutron\nremoval from 12Be. Detailed simulations were performed\n[22], including the effects of the geometric acceptance of\nthe neutron detector array, the energy and angular strag-\ngling of charged particles, the energy loss in the target, and\nthe divergence and energy spread of the beam. The effects\nof the telescope resolution and efficiency were included,\nalong with the absorption of neutrons by the telescope [a\n10% effect [25] ]. The momentum spread arising from the\nneutron removal was determined from the measured angu-\nlar distribution of neutrons from the very low energy decay\nof 11Be\u000b\u00034:0 MeV\u0004 to 10Be\u000b\u00032\u0006; 3:37 MeV\u0004 \u0006 n (cf.\nFig. 2), where the neutron momentum distribution was\ndominated by that of the 11Be\u000b before decay. The detection\nof a fast neutron (En > 15 MeV) from the breakup of 12Be,\nmeasured in coincidence with a 10Be from the subsequent\ndecay of 11Be\u000b, was also simulated.\nSimulations were performed for the decay of the un-\nbound states in 11Be below 4 MeV (assumed isotropic in\nthe 11Be rest frame), including the decay from the\n\u00054 MeV state to the 2\u0006 state in 10Be, and also the detec-\ntion of neutrons diffracted from 12Be in coincidence with a\n10Be core.

The Sexp listed in\nTable I are, except for the 1=2\u0006 state, the ratio of the\nexperimental (\u0006exp) to the eikonal model partial cross\nsection (\u0006sp). For the 1=2\u0006 state, the measurement of\ndiffractive breakup of 12Be to the two bound 11Be states\nhas been used, with the 1=2\u0002 contribution being subtracted\naccording to its theoretical diffraction cross section (see\nTable I) and the Sexp of 0:44\u0007 0:08 found here. The\nuncertainties quoted for Sexp in Table I do not include\ncontributions from the assumptions in the reaction calcu-\nlation, where, for example, two-step processes are not\nincluded, and it is estimated that this implies an additional\nuncertainty of up to 20% [consistent with Ref. [3] ].\nThe present reaction analysis follows closely the eikonal\nmodel of Refs. [3,26]. The neutron-target S matrix was\ncomputed from the target density and the JLM effective\nnucleon-nucleon interaction [27]. The usual real and\nimaginary part scale factors (\u0007V \u0001 1:0, \u0007W \u0001 0:8) were\napplied to the optical potential. The matter densities for\n12C and 10Be were of harmonic oscillator and Gaussian\nform, respectively, with rms radii of 2.4 and 2.28 fm. For\nthe 1=2\u0006, 1=2\u0002, and 5=2\u0006 (particle) transitions, (10Be\u0006 n)\ncomposite core-target S matrices were constructed from\nthose of 10Be and the neutron [26]. In the (unbound) 5=2\u0006\ncase, a separation energy of 0.01 MeV was used to com-\npute the S matrix. For the 3=2\u0002 (hole) state, a Gaussian\n(mass 11) core density of rms radius 2.54 fm was used,\nrepresentative of the size of 12Be. The removed-nucleon\nsingle-particle overlaps were taken as eigenstates of\nWoods-Saxon potentials, with geometry r0 \u0001 1:25 fm\nand a \u0001 0:7 fm, and with depths adjusted to the physical\nseparation energies for each final state.2-3\nPRL 96, 032502 (2006) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending27 JANUARY 2006\nOur observation of the 5=2\u0006 state in knockout from 12Be\nis the first direct experimental evidence for a significant\nd-wave intruder component in any N \u0001 8 isotone. Barker\n[6] first pointed out that the observed lowering of the 1s1=2\nand 0d5=2 neutron orbitals in 11Be should lead to strong\nadmixtures of these orbitals in the ground state of 12Be and\nconcluded [6,7] that as little as 20%\u201340% of the 12Be\nground state might comprise the 0@! \u0001\u00030p1=2\u00042 configura-\ntion. This model also successfully predicted a strong 1s1=2\nadmixture in the 11Li ground state.\nThe \u00031s0d\u00042 contribution to the 12Be ground state was\ndeduced in an indirect fashion by Fortune et al. [9] in light\nof their measurements of \b1=2 and E\u00032\u00061 \u0004 for 12Be [8,28].\nIndeed, according to subsequent psd-space shell-model\ncalculations, the \u0005 decay from the 12Be ground state is\nquenched to an extent that places an upper limit of 35% on\nthe 0@! component of the wave function [29]. The\n12O-12Be Coulomb energy difference also supports shell\nbreaking of this order [30].\nThe magnitude of shell breaking observed in the present\nwork can be quantified by comparing with theory. Table I\nincludes spectroscopic factors (WBT2) based on the shell-\nmodel calculations reported in Ref. [3], which correspond\nto a mixing of 32% 0@! (0p8) and 68% 2@! (0p6\u00031s0d\u00042)\ncontributions. The sum of these is close to the value 2.0 that\nwould be expected in the simplest picture. These values are\nscaled by 0.8 to give WBT20 [which is consistent with other\nknockout work [31] ] and this reproduces the present ex-\nperimental results very well. Also listed for comparison,\nthe EXC2 values from a 3-body model including 10Be core\nexcitation [14] give good agreement with the present work\nwhile reproducing other features of 12Be.\nRecently, Iwasaki et al. inferred the disappearance of the\nN \u0001 8 shell gap in 12Be from both the deformation length\nderived from inelastic proton scattering to the 2\u00061 state [2],\nand the low energy and large B\u0003E1; 0\u0006 ! 1\u0002\u0004 for the 1\u00021\nstate [4]. Their deductions agreed in detail with the psd\nshell-model calculations [13,29], concluding that the 0p1=2\nand 1s1=2 orbitals are effectively degenerate for 12Be, just\nas they are in 11Be.\nConsistent theoretical results are obtained using nuclear\nfield theory [12], which predicts both the presence of large\n\u0001\u00030d5=2\u00042 strength in 12Be and its absence in 11Li, in\nagreement with a recent theoretical analysis [32] of 11Li\nreaction data [1]. It is interesting to note that the early work\nof Barker [6] also predicted a low-lying 0\u00062 state at\n2.35 MeV in 12Be which has only recently been observed,\nat 2.24 MeV [5].\nThus, the neutron shell breaking observed at N \u0001 8 for\n12Be, but not 14C, is similar to the breaking of N \u0001 20 for\n32Mg but not 34Si. In each case, when the proton j> orbital\nis full, the neutrons are magic. When protons are removed,\nthe full j< orbital for neutrons is no longer magic, the next\nshell intrudes, and deformation results.03250In conclusion, single-neutron removal cross sections\nfrom 12Be to the 0.32 MeV (1=2\u0002) and 1.78 MeV (5=2\u0006)\nstates in 11Be have been measured. From these and eikonal\nmodel calculations, spectroscopic factors were deduced.\nThese indicate strong breaking of the N \u0001 8 magic number\nin 12Be, including a significant d-wave component. This is\ndistinct from other N \u0001 8 isotones and is the first direct\nexperimental confirmation of the predictions of a number\nof structure models.\nThe authors wish to acknowledge the support provided\nby the technical staff of LPC and GANIL.
