We find that the decay begins from the high frequency spectral\ndomain of the surface oscillations and is of a quasi-adiabatic character. The\ncharacteristic relaxation time of the whole turbulent cascade is close to the\nviscous damping time for capillary waves of frequency equal to the driving\nfrequency.\nPACS: 47.27.-i, 47.25.+i\nWe report and discuss the main results of an investigation into the decay\nof turbulence in a system of capillary waves on the charged surface of liquid\nhydrogen following removal of an external driving force. This work represents\nan extension of our recent studies of steady-state capillary turbulence1,2.\nIt is known that the turbulent behavior of waves on the surface of a liquid\ncan be well-described within the framework of weak turbulence theory3. In\nthis approach the statistical properties of an ensemble of surface waves are\ncharacterized by \u201coccupation numbers\u201d n\u03c9 for wave modes of frequency \u03c9,\nobeying the kinetic equation\n\u2202n\u03c9\n\u2202t\n= St[n\u03c9]\u2212 2\u03b3\u03c9n\u03c9 + Fdrive(t).

For capillary waves, where the dispersion relation\n\u03c9 = (\u03c3\/\u03c1)1\/2k3\/2 is of the decay type, it is the interaction of three surface\nPublished in J. Low Temp.

Kolmakov et al.\nwaves that makes the main contribution to the collision integral (i.e. the\ndecay of one wave into two waves, and the opposite process of confluence of\ntwo waves into one wave).\nIn the inertial frequency range (i.e. much higher then the driving fre-\nquency, but lower than the frequency scale where the dissipation plays\nthe dominant role in the wave dynamics) the turbulent behavior of capil-\nlary waves is determined mainly by their nonlinear interaction. For wide-\nband pumping of the liquid surface the Kolmogorov turbulence spectrum\nn\u03c9 \u223c Q1\/2\u03c9\u221215\/6 becomes established, where the energy flux Q is directed\ntowards the high frequency domain.\nIn our earlier experiments1,2 on the charged surface of liquid hydrogen,\nwe observed and studied capillary turbulence over a rather wide range of\nfrequencies (from 100 Hz to 10 kHz). The remarkable properties of liquid\nhydrogen \u2013 its small density, low viscosity, high nonlinearity of capillary\nwaves, and the possibility of driving the electrically charged surface of the\nliquid directly \u2013 allowed us to establish for the first time how the scaling ex-\nponent of the turbulence distribution depends on the spectral characteristics\nof the driving force, and to observe the high frequency cut-off of the power\nspectrum of capillary turbulence caused by the change in the energy transfer\nmechanism from nonlinear wave transformation to viscous damping2.\nIn what follows we describe a new investigation of the decay of capillary\nturbulence on the charged surface of liquid hydrogen, seeking to establish\nwhat happens following a step-like removal of the driving force.\nThe experimental arrangements were similar to those used in our earlier\nstudies of steady state turbulence4. The measurements were made using an\noptical cell inside a helium cryostat. Hydrogen was condensed into a cup\nformed by a bottom capacitor plate and a guard ring 60 mm in diameter\nand 6 mm high. The layer of liquid was 6 mm thick. The top capacitor\nplate (a collector 60 mm in diameter) was located at a distance of 4 mm\nabove the surface of the liquid. A two-dimensional positive charge layer was\ncreated just below the surface of the liquid with the aid of a radioactive plate\nplaced at the bottom of the cup. The temperature of the liquid was 15.5 K.\nThe waves on the charged surface were excited by a periodic driving voltage\napplied between the guard ring and the upper electrode. They were detected\nfrom the variation of the total power P (t) of a laser beam reflected from the\noscillating surface, which was measured with a photodetector, sampled with\nan analogue-to-digital converter, and stored in a computer. Given the size of\nthe light spot, the correlation function I\u03c9 = \u3008|\u03b7\u03c9|2\u3009 of the surface elevation\n\u03b7(r, t) in frequency representation is directly proportional to the squared\nmodulus of the Fourier transform of the detected signal, I\u03c9 = constP 2\u03c9 at\nfrequencies above 50 Hz.\nDecay of the Turbulent Cascade of Capillary Waves\nFig. 1. (a) Relaxation of oscillations of the charged liquid hydrogen surface\nafter removal of external driving at frequency \u03c9p\/2pi = 97 Hz at time t = 0.\n(b) Dependence on time of the amplitude of the recorded signal P (t): curve\n1 for a driving frequency \u03c9p\/2pi = 97 Hz; and curve 2 for \u03c9p\/2pi = 173 Hz.\nIn systems of finite size, the power spectrum of capillary turbulence is\ndiscrete; but, at frequencies much higher than the lowest resonant frequency\n(\u223c3 Hz in our experiments), the intrinsic spectrum of resonant frequen-\ncies becomes quasi-continuous due to viscous broadening of the resonances\nand\/or nonlinear broadening for pumping rates exceeding a critical value.\nUnder these conditions the distribution of turbulent oscillations of the sur-\nface of liquid in a cell of finite dimensions is close to that expected for the\nunrestricted surface (see theory5,6 and observations1,2,7,8). To establish the\nsteady turbulent state at the surface of the liquid, a 95 Hz ac driving volt-\nage was applied for \u223c10 s. After it was switched off, we observed relaxation\noscillations of the surface. The instantaneous power spectrum P 2\u03c9 of the non-\nstationary surface oscillations was calculated by application of a short-time\nFourier transform9 to the measured signal P (t).\nFig. 1(a) shows a fragment of the experimental signal P (t) from a pho-\ntodetector recorded when driving at a frequency \u03c9p\/2pi = 97 Hz. The driv-\ning force was removed at time t = 0. For t > 0 we observe the relaxation\nof surface oscillations (decreasing signal amplitude). Fig. 1(b) shows the\ndependence of the signal amplitude on time, after driving at frequencies\n\u03c9p\/2pi = 97 Hz (see Fig. 1(a)) and \u03c9p\/2pi = 173 Hz. The data presented in\nFig. 1(b) were obtained by averaging the modulus of the signal P (t) over. It\nis found that the decreasing signal amplitude following removal of the driving\nforce could be well-described by the exponential function P (t) \u223c exp(\u2212t\/\u03c4),\nwhere the effective relaxation time \u03c4 = (0.3 \u00b1 0.03) s for driving frequency\n\u03c9p\/2pi = 97 Hz and \u03c4 = (0.15\u00b1 0.02) s for frequency \u03c9p\/2pi = 173 Hz. The\ndependence of the effective relaxation time \u03c4 on frequency \u03c9p\/2pi is shown\nby filled circles in Fig. 2. The straight line shows the dependence of the\nviscous damping time for capillary waves \u03c4\u03c9 = \u03b3\u22121\u03c9 at frequency \u03c9 = \u03c9p,\ncalculated from the known parameters10 of liquid hydrogen at 15.5 K.

At times\nclose to t = 0 the calculated spectrum of surface oscillations is close to the\nsteady-state distribution of capillary waves observed in earlier experiments\nusing narrow-band driving2; the initial (steady-state) boundary frequency\nof the inertial interval was \u03c9b\/2pi \u2248 5 kHz. The main spectral peak in Fig.\n3(a) is at the driving frequency of 97 Hz, and the peaks at harmonics of\nthe driving frequency form a cascade with a power dependence P 2\u03c9 \u223c \u03c9\u22123.5\nof the peak amplitudes, in accordance both with our previous observations2\nand with theory3. The arrow marks the high frequency boundary of the\ninertial range. It is evident from Fig. 3(a) that the boundary frequency of\nthe inertial interval has moved down from its initial value \u03c9b\/2pi \u2248 5 kHz at\nt = 0 to \u03c9b\/2pi = 2 kHz at t = 0.35 s. Fig. 3(b) shows the final stage in the\ndecay of turbulence at t = 1.07 s, when only a few harmonics are excited.\nIt is remarkable that the low-frequency part of the spectrum of surface\noscillations can still be well-described by the same power law P 2\u03c9 \u223c \u03c9\u22123.5\nas is valid for the steady-state turbulent distribution during the relatively\nlong time interval t < 0.6 s after removal of the driving force. The decay\nof the turbulence starts from the high frequency domain of the spectrum\nand is accompanied by movement of the high frequency boundary \u03c9b of the\ninertial interval towards the low frequency domain. It can clearly be seen in\nFig. 3 that the amplitude of the surface oscillations at the driving frequency\nDecay of the Turbulent Cascade of Capillary Waves\nFig. 3.

These observations differ significantly from what could be\nexpected from the self-similar theory of nonstationary turbulent processes3,\nwhich was developed for cases where the dissipation is strictly equal to zero.\nNote that we do not observe any transition processes (for example, front\npropagation from low to high frequencies) after removal of the driving force.\nThis means that the presence of finite viscous damping of the waves causes\na qualitative change in how the system of nonlinear surface waves relaxes.\nWe may infer that the shape of the low frequency (power-like) part of the\nspectrum is stabilized by a fast redistribution of energy between waves within\nthe inertial range of frequencies. This is why the observed spectrum remains\nclose to quasiequilibrium over relatively long times following the start of the\ndecay.\nBy numerical integration of the kinetic equation (1) we have shown11\nthat, at large times, the decrease in amplitude of low frequency waves is\nmainly on account of viscous damping; nonlinear interaction with high fre-\nquency oscillations is negligibly small due to the smallness of the amplitudes\nof the high frequency waves. Waves of frequency much higher than the driv-\ning frequency are excited by interaction with low frequency waves. This\nmeans that under the conditions of real experiments (i.e. for finite width\nof the inertial range, limited by viscosity at frequencies of 5-10 kHz) the\nnonlocal interaction between capillary waves is comparable with this local\ninteraction of waves. This accounts convincingly for the observed peculiar-\nities in the decay of capillary turbulence on the surface of liquid hydrogen.\nIn particular it explains why the dependence on the driving frequency of\nthe effective relaxation time of surface oscillations is close to the dependence\nG. V. Kolmakov et al.\ntypical of linear waves.\nIn conclusion, after removal of a low frequency driving force, we observe\na quasi-adiabatic decay of the turbulent cascade of capillary waves on the\nsurface of liquid hydrogen. The decay starts from high frequency domain of\nthe spectrum, and the effective relaxation time of the cascade is close to the\nviscous damping time for waves of frequency equal to the driving frequency.\nThe energy-containing range stays in the low frequency domain throughout\nthe decay. This indicates that viscous losses at all frequencies are of central\nimportance for the correct interpretation of relaxation processes in a system\nof nonlinearly interacting capillary waves.\nThe authors are very grateful to V.E.
