The performance range of these\ndevices can be extended through use of AlGaN buffer layers,\nallowing control of the in-plane lattice parameter while re-\ntaining an ideally low threading dislocation density. One suc-\ncessful method of fabricating AlGaN buffer layers that act as\ntemplates for subsequent device structure growth, without\nthe formation of cracks due the tensile strain between AlGaN\nand GaN,1 is through the use of AlN interlayers. These re-\nlieve the stress between the GaN underlayer and the AlGaN\nlayer on top,2 although some increase in the edge dislocation\ndensity threading through the AlGaN layer was observed.\nThe best device layer growth occurs with the thinnest AlN\ninterlayer for which cracking does not occur. Such inter-\nlayers have been used successfully in Bragg reflector\nmirrors3,4 and solar blind detectors.5\nThe mechanism of stress relief in interlayers is now re-\nceiving significant attention. Bla\u00a8sing et al.6 showed that for\nlow temperature interlayers a thin 100 nm Al0.21Ga0.79N was\ncompressively stressed due to the effect of the interlayer, but\nthat this was reversed at higher interlayer growth tempera-\ntures. They concluded that the lowering of the growth tem-\nperature leads to a decoherence of the growth between the\nGaN underlayer and AlGaN overlayer.\nGrowth of the epilayers used in the present study was\ncarried out using low pressure metalorganic vapor phase ep-\nitaxy in a showerhead reactor. GaN was grown on basal\nplane sapphire substrates using a GaN low temperature\nnucleation layer followed by growth of ;1 mm GaN at\n1035 \u00b0C. The temperature was lowered to 600 \u00b0C and the\nAlN interlayer deposited. The AlGaN growth ~typically 1\nmm! was carried out at a temperature of 1050 \u00b0C. The details\nof the sample structures are given in Table I. Two series of\nsamples were grown. The first had the device buffer of com-\nposition Al0.25Ga0.75N and AlN interlayer thicknesses of\n80 \u00c5<d<220 \u00c5. The second had varying device buffer\ncomposition AlxGa12xN, with 0.16<x<0.46 and constant\nAlN interlayer thickness d5150 \u00c5.\nHigh resolution x-ray diffraction ~HRXRD! measure-\nments were performed on a dual source Bede D1 diffracto-\nmeter using a Cu target Microsource\u00ae microfocus generator\nequipped with a polycapillary focusing optic of divergence\n0.17\u00b0. Surface-symmetric HRXRD measurements were made\nwith a symmetrically cut Ge 004 beam-conditioning crystal,\ngiving a beam of 2 mm32 mm on the sample. An asym-\nmetrically cut Si 220 analyzer crystal of 12 arcsec accep-\ntance permitted the separation of mosaic tilt from strain.\nSkew-symmetric reflections were used to determine the re-\nlaxation ~by measurement of a and c lattice parameters! of\nthe individual GaN and AlGaN buffer layers.

Both for GIIXD and HRXRD\ngeometries the instrumental resolution, determined using a\nsingle crystal silicon wafer, was over an order of magnitude\nsmaller than the measured rocking curve widths.\nFigure 1 shows the full width at half height maximum\n~FWHM! of the rocking curve versus interlayer thickness for\nthe first set of samples. In the surface symmetric reflections\nwe resolved the individual Bragg peaks associated with the\nGaN and AlGaN. For both layers, the rocking curves of the\n00.2, 00.4, and 00.6 reflections were of almost identical\nshape and had FWHM within 6% of each other, there being\nno systematic trend with Bragg angle. This indicates that the\nFWHM is dominated by the mosaic spread. For surface sym-\nmetric reflections, the mosaic is pure tilt, associated with\nthreading screw dislocations. Similarly, in the GIIXD mea-\nsurements, the shape and FWHM of the 10.0, 20.0 and 11.0\nrocking curves were almost equal, showing that the FWHM\nhere determines the twist mosaic, associated with threading\nedge dislocations.9 In GIIXD, where the incident beam inci-\ndence angle is below the critical angle for total external re-\nflection, the evanescent wave does not penetrate more than a\nfew nanometers and the 11.0 reflection rocking curve\nFWHM corresponds to the value of the twist mosaic spread\nof the AlGaN buffer. We note in Fig. 1 that the tilt mosaic,\nand hence the threading screw dislocation density, is equal\nfor GaN and AlGaN buffer layers and independent of inter-\nlayer thickness. The twist mosaic of the AlGaN layer in-\ncreases linearly with interlayer thickness and is significantly\nlarger than the tilt mosaic.\nThe rocking curve FWHM versus the AlxGa12xN buffer\nlayer composition in the second series of samples is dis-\nplayed in Fig. 2. Again, the tilt mosaic is equal for the GaN\nand AlGaN layers and is independent of Al fraction in the\nAlGaN layer. There is also no change in the FWHM when\nthe AlGaN is grown at 1080 \u00b0C, rather than 1050 \u00b0C. The\nFWHM of the 11.0 reflection, and hence twist mosaic, rises\nwith Al fraction and is 3 or 4 times the value of the tilt\nmosaic.\nThe origin of the twist mosaic in the AlGaN must relate\nto the role of the interlayer. A series of skew symmetric\nreflections was taken for the sample with x50.46 and d\n5150 \u00c5 to determine the twist mosaic in the buried GaN\nbuffer layer. For this sample, the AlGaN layer is ;0.4 mm\nthick. The high resolution triple axis setting permits the scat-\nter around the reciprocal lattice points associated with the\nGaN and AlGaN layers to be separated and the high inci-\ndence angle permits the GaN peak to be independently ob-\nserved in the rocking curve. However, skew symmetric re-\nflection rocking curves contain contributions from both tilt\nand twist mosaic and it is necessary to extrapolate the\nFWHM values to a skew angle of 90\u00b0 in order to determine\nthe twist mosaic. This has been done in Fig. 3, using the\nmodel of Srikant et al.10 For the GaN layer, the twist mosaic\nis determined to be 0.16\u00b0, comparable with the tilt mosaic\nand much less than the twist mosaic of 0.46\u00b0 in the corre-\nsponding AlGaN layer. The interlayer appears to add thread-\ning edge dislocations as has been observed using transmis-\nsion electron microscopy by Amano and Akasaki.2\nThe twist mosaic in the GaN buffer layer arises from the\nthreading components of the dislocations associated with the\nlattice mismatch between the nucleation layer and the sap-\nphire substrate. There is initial island growth, with subse-\nquent growth being equivalent to lateral overgrowth. The\ntwist mosaic arises from the coalescence of the islands, giv-\ning blocks of high perfection separated by high dislocation\ndensity cell walls and rotated with respect to each other.\nWhile the interlayer does not affect the tilt mosaic\n~threading screw dislocation density!, there is a linear in-\nFIG. 1.

There is also\na change in the in-plane lattice parameter of the AlGaN layer\nwith interlayer thickness. From the analyzer peak position in\nthe symmetric 00.2 and in-plane diffraction 11.0 reflections,\nthe a and c lattice parameters as a function of the AlGaN\nlayer thickness ~Fig. 4! can be determined independently of\nthe Al fraction.11 As the interlayer thickness increases, the\nin-plane lattice parameter of the AlGaN layer decreases. It\ntherefore becomes more strained with respect to the underly-\ning AlN interlayer ~assumed to be fully relaxed with respect\nto the GaN buffer!. The variation in strain does not fit well\nthe standard strain relief models, shown by the solid lines in\nFig. 4, but the trend is similar. As observed by Bla\u00a8sing\net al.,6 the AlGaN layer is seen to be compressively strained\nin-plane when the a lattice parameter is plotted against Al\nfraction x ~Fig. 5!. There is a linear fall in lattice parameter\nwith x, and although the gradient is very close to that for\nrelaxed AlxGa12xN there is a shift in absolute values.\nThe increase in twist mosaic in the AlGaN as a function\nof interlayer thickness cannot be associated with an increase\nin threading edge segments from additional misfit disloca-\ntions at the AlN\/AlGaN interface. The additional threading\nedge dislocations appear to originate in the AlN layer. They\ncould be associated with an increase in misfit dislocation\ndensity at the GaN\/AlN interface as the AlN interlayer thick-\nness increases. The best growth then occurs when the AlN\ninterlayer has a minimum number of misfit and threading\nedge dislocations. However, this also corresponds to a maxi-\nmum elastic strain, relieved beyond a critical threshold by\ncracking.\nThe increase in twist mosaic, and thus threading edge\ndislocation density, with increasing Al fraction in the AlGaN\nlayer is less easy to explain. Increase of the Al content for a\nconstant interlayer thickness decreases the lattice mismatch\nwith respect to the AlN interlayer. The higher threading dis-\nlocation density for higher Al fraction therefore does not\nappear to be driven by relaxation between the AlN interlayer\nand the AlGaN layer. It has, however, been observed12 that\nthe surface morphology of the AlGaN layer changes as a\nfunction of the Al fraction. For higher Al content, the rough-\nness correlation length decreases, implying that the size of\nthe growth islands of the AlGaN on the AlN decreases. There\nis also an indication that the roughness amplitude increases\nwith x. However, the increase in FWHM could only be ex-\nplained by reduction of the diffracting domain size if the\nFWHM remained constant in reciprocal space. Our measure-\nments show that the FWHM is constant in angular space.9 If\nthe reduction in domain size results in an increased FWHM,\nthen it must also indicate an increase in the threading edge\ndislocation density associated with the smaller diffracting el-\nement boundaries.\nFinancial support for the GaN MOVPE growth program\nis acknowledged from EPSRC.\n1 R.
