Abstract\nAcoustic Emission (AE) technology applied to condition monitoring is gaining\nacceptance as a useful complimentary tool. This paper demonstrates the use of AE\nmeasurements to detect, monitor the growth and locate natural defect initiation and\npropagation in a conventional rolling element bearing. To undertake this task a special\npurpose test-rig was built to allow for accelerated natural degradation of a bearing\nrace. It is concluded that crack initiation and its subsequent propagation is detectable\nwith AE technology. The paper also investigates the source characterisation of AE\nsignals associated with a defective bearing whilst in operation.\nKeywords: Acoustic Emission, condition monitoring, natural degradation and thrust\nbearing.\n2. Introduction\nAcoustic Emission (AE) are transient elastic waves generated by the rapid release of\nenergy from localized sources within a material [1]; typical frequency content of AE\nis between 100 kHz to 1 MHz. A tremendous amount of work has been undertaken\nover the last 20-years in developing the application of the Acoustic Emission\ntechnology for bearing health monitoring [2]. The high sensitivity of AE in detecting\nthe loss of mechanical integrity at early stages has become one of the significant\nadvantages over the well-established vibration monitoring technique. Jamaludin et al.\n[3] presented the challenges faced with using the vibration technology to monitor the\nmechanical integrity of slow speed bearings (less than 60rpm) and suggested that the\nAE technology could overcome such difficulties. Sources of AE in rotating machinery\ninclude impacting, cyclic fatigue, friction, turbulence, etc. For instance, the interaction\nof surface asperities and impingement of the bearing rollers over a defect on an outer\nrace will result in the generation of acoustic emission. These emissions propagate on\nthe surface of the material as Rayleigh waves and are measured with an AE sensor.\n2Other wave types associated with the propagation of AE include Lamb, Longitudinal\nand Shear waves.\nTo date most published work on the application of the AE to monitoring bearing\nmechanical integrity have been conducted on artificially or \u2018seeded\u2019 damage which\nare generally induced with an electrical discharge system, engraving machine or by\nintroducing debris into the lubricant [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. However, Price et al. [8] showed\nthe applicability of AE to monitor naturally generated scuffing and pitting defects in a\nfour-ball lubricant test machine. To date the only published work of Yoshioka [9]\ncould be considered the first that directly addressed identification of the onset of\nnatural degradation in bearings with AE. It is worth noting that Yoshioka employed a\nbearing with only three rolling elements which is not representative of a typical\noperational bearing. Moreover, Yoshioka terminated AE tests once AE activity\nincreased as such the propagation of identified sub-surface defects to surface defects\nwas not monitored. This work builds further on the work of Yoshioka by monitoring\nnot only the initiation of cracks, but also its propagation to spalls or surface defects on\na conventional bearing with the complete set of rolling elements. The location of the\nAE source was also monitored throughout the test sequence in order to validate that\nthe AE\u2019s generated throughout the test period can be eventually attributed to the\nsurface defect noted at the end of the test\n3. Test-rig design and layout\nA specially designed test rig that encouraged the natural damage condition of a test\nbearing was employed. To accelerate natural crack initiation a combination of a thrust\nball bearing and a thrust roller bearing was employed. One race of thrust ball bearing\n(SKF 51210) was replaced with a flat race taken from thrust roller bearing (SKF\n81210 TN) of the same size, as shown in figure 1. As a consequence, this arrangement\ncaused higher contact pressure on a flat track relative to the grooved track due to the\nreduced contact area between the ball elements and the flat race.\n3Figure 1 Test bearing arrangement\nFor this study, bearing run to failure tests were performed under natural damage\nconditions. A specifically designed test-rig, as shown in figure 2, was employed for\nthis investigation. It consisted of a hydraulic loading device, a geared electrical motor\n(MOTOVARIO-Type HA52 B3-B6-B7 j20, 46-Lubricated: AGIP), a coupling and a\nsupporting structure. The test bearing was placed between the fixed thrust loading\nshaft and the rotating disk which housed the grooved race. The flat race was fitted\nonto the loading shaft in a specifically designed housing. This housing was\nconstructed to allow for placement of AE sensors and thermocouples directly onto the\nrace. The thrust shaft was driven by a hydraulic cylinder (Hi-Force HYDRAULICS-\nMODEL No: HP110-HAND PUMP-SINGLE SPEED-WORKING PRESSURE: 700\nBAR) which moved forward to load the bearing and backwards for periodic\ninspections of the test bearing face. The rotating disk was driven by a shaft attached to\na geared motor with an output speed of 72rpm. A thrust bearing (SKF 81214 TN) was\nplaced between the coupling and the test bearing and a flexible coupling was\nemployed between the shaft and the geared motor.\n4Figure 2 Test-rig layout\n4. Instrumentations\nA schematic of the data acquisition process is detailed in figure 3. The AE acquisition\nsystem employed commercially available piezoelectric sensors (Physical Acoustic\nCorporation type \u201cPICO\u201d) with an operating range of 200-750 kHz at temperatures\nranging from -65 to 177oC. Four AE sensors, together with two thermocouples\n(RoHS-Type: J x 1M 455-4371) were attached to the back of the flat raceway, see\nfigure 1. The acoustic sensors were connected to a data acquisition system through a\npreamplifier (40 dB gain), see figures 3.\nFigure 3 Schematic of the data acquisition systems\n5The acquisition system was continuously set to acquire AE absolute energy (Joules)\nover a time constant of 10 ms at a sampling rate of 100 Hz. The absolute energy is a\nmeasure of the true energy and is derived from the integral of the squared voltage\nsignal divided by the reference resistance (10 k-ohms) over the duration of the AE\nsignal. In addition to continuous recording of AE absolute energy (Atto-Joules or\n10-18 Joules, AE waveforms were periodically acquired at a sampling rate of 2MHz.\nIn all cases, AE measurements were taken simultaneously from all four AE sensors.\nUnder normal conditions of load, rotational speed and good alignment, surface\ndamage begins with small cracks, located between the surface of the flat track and the\nrolling elements, which gradually propagate to the surface generating detectable AE\nsignals. The procedure employed to determine the test duration to the onset of surface\nfatigue has been previously described by Elforjani et al. [10] and involved the\nHertizan theory for determining surface stresses and deformations [11], Thomas and\nHoersh theory for sub-surface stress [11], and, the Lundberg and Palmgren theory for\nfatigue evaluation [12].\n5. Experimental Results Observations and Discussions\n5.1 AE source location\nThe capability of AE to determine source locations of signals emanating in real time\nfrom materials under load is one of the significant advantages AE offers over other\nnon-destructive test (NDT) technologies. In application the AE signals travelling\nthrough the medium are attenuated and arrive at different sensors with a time delay.\nThis delay can be attributed to the distance between the source (defect) and AE\nsensors, and, with knowledge of the signal velocity the location of the AE source can\nbe identified. For this particular investigation efforts were made to identify the defect\nlocation (AE source location) in real-time. This was accomplished by identifying the\nwave velocity on the ring experimentally. At a threshold of 52dB and with known\ndistances between the AE sensors, the velocity of the AE waveform under such\nconditions was experimentally determined at 4,000 m\/sec. Interestingly, the dominant\nfrequency content of AE\u2019s recorded was approximately 300kHz and the wave velocity\nof 4,000 m\/sec corresponds to the symmetric zeroth lamb wave mode (So) for steel at\n61.8mmMHz (0.3MHz x 6mm thk) The propagation velocity (4,000 m\/sec) was used\nfor all source location investigations and prior to the onset of testing several Hsu-\nNielsen sources were made at various positions on the surface to establish the\naccuracy at this velocity and specific threshold level. Results were within 4% of the\nexact geometric location of the Hsu-Nielsen sources. Figure 4 shows the source\nlocation layout used which essentially \u2018unwrapped\u2019 the bearing race for linear\nlocation.\nThe location plots show cumulative energy over the test simulation. It is worth\nmentioning that only AE events above a threshold of 52dB contribute to the source\nlocation. Whenever the threshold is exceeded, the location of the source is computed\nand identified. The AE energy is assigned to the geometric position (source); this is a\ncumulative process and as such a fixed source will have the largest contributory\nenergy in a cumulative plot.\nFigure 4 Source location layout for linear detection\n5.2 Bearing Tests\nFor this particular paper three experimental cases are presented that reflect the general\nobservations associated with over a dozen experimental tests at loads ranging from\n20, 35 and 50kN. Case I represents observations noted at a load condition of 50kN\n7whilst Case II and Case III present results for a test load of 35kN and 20kN\nrespectively.\n5.2.1 Case I\nObservations of AE energy monitored continuously over 16-hrs (hours) of bearing\noperation are presented in figure 5. An axial force of 50kN was applied on the test\nbearing. During the first hour of the test, an increase in AE activity levels and\ntemperature was noted. This was attributed to the \u2018run-in\u2019 phase, as after this period\n(1-hr) all measured AE parameters and temperature remained constant for another 9-\nhrs, see figure 4. It was observed that at approximately 10-hrs into the test AE started\nto increase steadily until the test was terminated (16-hrs). It is worth mentioning that\nthe bearing was lubricated during the testing with Castrol, Moly Grease (650-EL).\nFollowing run-in (0- to 1-hr) the bearing temperature stabilized at 35oC and after 16-\nhrs operation a maximum temperature of 40oC was recorded, see figure 5. AE\nwaveforms, recorded during the test, clearly showed AE transient events after 10-\nhours, and by the termination of the test, AE waveforms showed a periodicity of AE\ntransient bursts at a frequency equivalent to 9Hz, see figure 6. At the end of the test\n(16-hrs) visible surface damage was observed with a circumferential length of 20mm\nsee figure 7; a damage had occurred in the region close to ch-1 AE sensor. The\nrelevance of this will be evident later.\nFigure 5 Test conditions run until visually observable surface damage\n8Figure 6 Typical AE waveforms during test case-I\nFigure 7 Crack zone on flat ring\nThus far the observations have shown AE can monitor the degradation of an\naccelerated test; the next phase of analysis involved source identification of AE\nactivity throughout the test duration. Figures 8 to 10 highlight the trends in source\nlocation throughout the test period; the region where the surface damage eventually\noccurred has been highlighted. Source location estimations employed in the bearing\n9test provided another simple and rapid means to correlate AE events measured with a\nspecific fault event on the test bearing.\nThese figures show that at the start of the test (run-in), figure 8, AE activity was\nevident within the damaged region with a maximum AE energy value of 249 x 105\natto-Joules (10-18). At about 10-hrs into operation, the concentration of the AE sources\nwas clearly located at the highlighted region, see figure 9. Lastly at 16-hrs operation\nthe location of the AE sources was limited to one region where the actual surface\ndamage occurred; estimation of the source location covered a circumferential defect\nwidth of approximately 20mm, see figure 10. A maximum energy value of 350 x 105\natto-Joules (10-18) was noted at 16-hrs operation (see figure 10).\nFigure 8 Source location estimates of AE events at 1-hr operation\n10\nFigure 9 Source location estimates of AE events at 10-hrs operation\nFigure 10 Source location estimates of AE events at 16-hrs operation\n5.2.2 Case II\nThe applied load on this test bearing was 35kN. Observations of continuous\nmonitoring of the AE levels for 20-hours of bearing operation are presented in figure\n11. It was noted that relatively high levels of AE activity was observed during the first\nhour of operation; this was attributed to run-in as after this period (1-hr) all measured\nAE parameters and temperature stabilised. After 14-hrs of operation significant high\nlevels of AE activity was noted, particularly the activity associated with AE energy.\n11\nAt the end of the test, the bearing temperature recorded a maximum value of 37oC,\nsee figure 11. Also noted on the AE waveform at 14-hrs operation was the high\ntransient nature of the waveform. It is also particularly interesting to note that the\nwaveform observed after 20-hrs of operations showed a periodicity of AE transient\nbursts at 9Hz; this periodicity is associated with the defect frequency (9Hz) of the\nbearing and is a clear indication of a damaged bearing, see figure 12. On termination\nof the test (20-hrs) a visual inspection revealed surface damage at two locations on the\nrace, see figure 13.\nFigure 11 Test conditions run until visually observable surface damage\n12\nFigure 12 Typical AE waveforms associated with case-II\nFigure 13 Crack zones on flat ring\nAs in the previous case the source location over the duration of the test is presented in\nfigures 14 to 16. At the start of the test, geometric concentrations of AE activity were\ndistributed across the circumferential length of the bearing and this is attributed to the\nrun-in condition, see figure 14. At 14-hrs relatively early signs of concentrated AE\nsource activity of the highlighted zones began to appear, see figure 15; geometric\n13\nconcentrations of AE activity in the eventual defect zones became evident with values\nof 100 x 103 atto-Joules (zone1) and 20 x 103 atto-Joules (zone 2). Figure 16 shows\nthe growing concentration of AE energy from the defect locations; after 20 hrs\noperation the concentration of the AE source was clearly located at the two\nhighlighted regions and the maximum energy values of 40 x 105 atto-Joules (zone1)\nand 42 x 105 atto-Joules (zone 2) were noted. These locations corresponded to the\nactual defects visually observed at the end of the test, see figure 13.\nFigure 14 Source location estimates of AE events at 1-hr operation\nFigure 15 Source location estimates of AE events at 14-hrs operation\n14\nFigure 16 Source location estimates of AE events at 20-hrs operation\n5.2.3 Case III\nThis case presents different trends to that noted in the earlier cases. During the start of\nthe test, the relatively high levels of AE and temperature noted in the previous cases\nwas not observed; observations of continuous monitoring of the AE levels, in addition\nto bearing temperature, for 50-hrs of bearing operation did not show any considerable\nrise at (0- to 1-hr) of testing. This was attributed to a lower axial load of 20kN applied\non this test bearing, see figure 17. A significant increase in AE levels was noted from\n45-hrs of operation until the test was terminated, as shown in figure 17. On the\ntermination of the test, bearing temperature recorded its maximum value of 39 oC. AE\nwaveforms recorded after 20-, 45- and 50-hours of testing are presented in figure 18.\nIt clearly shows AE transient events, observed after 45-hours which eventually\ndeveloped into periodic transient events as the test progressed; the eventual\nperiodicity was 9Hz which corresponded to the defect frequency of the bearing.\nVisual inspection after 50-hrs operation indicated surface damage had occurred in the\nregion, which was located approximately 20mm from ch-2 AE sensor, see figure 19.\n15\nFigure 17 Test conditions run until visually observable surface damage\nFigure 18 AE waveform\n16\nFigure 19 Crack zone on flat ring\nIn contrast to the previous cases, a geometric concentration of the AE source was not\nnoted until approximately 40hrs; this is attributed to the low load (20kN) applied on\nthis test; see figure 20. Furthermore, these cumulative plots compute and identify only\nAE events above the defined threshold (52dB). It is particularly interesting to note\nthat the onset of crack development could have been identified as early as 45-hrs into\nthe operation of the test bearing, as shown in figure 21. From 45hrs of operation a\nspecific geometric AE source was noted which approximated to a surface damage of\n20mm in circumferential length in the vicinity of ch-2, see figures 21 and 22.\nFigure 20 Source location estimates of AE events at 1-hr operation\n17\nFigure 21 Source location estimates of AE events at 45-hrs operation\nFigure 22 Source location estimates of AE events at 50-hrs operation\n6. Conclusion\nUnder natural damage conditions, bearing run-to-failure tests were successfully\nperformed. The study has shown that the AE energy is a reliable, robust and sensitive\nparameter for detection of incipient cracks and surface spalls in a slow speed bearing\nwhilst in operation. It also successfully demonstrated the ability to determine the\n18\nsource of AE during operation. At the rotational speed on which these tests were\nemployed, this is the first known attempt at correlating AE and natural defect\ngeneration and location.\n7.
