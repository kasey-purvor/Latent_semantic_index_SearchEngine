Joseph (ed.), Reclaiming the Political in Latin American History : Essays\nfrom the North (Durham, NC, and London: Duke University Press, 2001),\npp. viii+379, \u00a315.50, pb.\nThis book is a collection of essays originally generated for a conference organised\nby Gilbert Joseph at Yale University in the spring of 1998 to honour Emilia Viotti\nda Costa\u2019s tenure there since 1973. Viotti da Costa, a Brazilian historian trained\nin France, was exiled to the USA in 1970. She came to Yale after brief terms at\nTulane University, the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana and Smith\nCollege. The 1998 conference hosted 30 of Viotti da Costa\u2019s graduate students,\nincluding Joseph. He finished his dissertation in 1978, and is now the Director of\nLatin American and Iberian Studies at Yale, and has recently served as an editor\nof the Hispanic American Historical Review.\nBesides an introductory essay by Joseph, the book consists of essays by ten of\nViotti da Costa\u2019s students, a contribution with which Viotti da Costa opened the\n1998 conference, and a brief afterword by Daniel James, a specialist on working-\nclass history, especially Argentina, and who earned his PhD at the University of\nLondon in 1979. He also taught briefly at Yale and is currently at Indiana University.\nOf the ten main contributors, two finished at Yale in the late 1970s (besides\nJoseph, Steve J. Stern in 1979) ; three completed work in the 1980s (BarbaraWeinstein\nand Florencia Mallon in 1980, and Jeff Gould in 1988). The others, Thomas Miller\nKlubock, Mary Ann Mahony, Heidi Tinsman, Diana Paton and Greg Grandin, all\ncompleted their work at Yale in the 1990s. Besides generational differences, the\ncontributors represent regional, chronological and thematic specialities, and their\npost-graduate publications, including the younger scholars represented here, often\nnavigate the intersections of these concerns.\nThese range broadly : from Weinstein\u2019s and Mahony\u2019s focus on nineteenth- and\ntwentieth-century Brazil, to important monographs onMexican and Andean regional\nhistory by Joseph, Mallon, and Stern ; to critical books on debates over ethnicity,\nnationalism, and identity in Central America and Chile by Gould, Grandin, and\nMiller Klubock. The central role of gender to critical social processes, whether in\nthe post-emancipation context of Jamaica or in the agrarian reform in Chile in the\n1960s and early 1970s, is best represented here in the essays by Paton and Tinsman,\nrespectively. While one finds some concern with the relevance of gender in certain\nof the arguments in some of the other essays, very briefly in the articles by Gould,\nMiller Klubock and Mallon, for Patton and Tinsman gender is the organising cate-\ngory of analysis.\nGiven this variability, there are of course many and very different ways to take\nadvantage of this kind of book. One approach is by juxtaposing the organisational\ntension growing out of the fact that four of the essays \u2013 those by Joseph, Stern,\nWeinstein and Mallon \u2013 are historiographical essays and\/or historiographical re-\nflections, and the fact that the other essays all focus on very specific problems\nJ. Lat. Amer. Stud. 36, 379\u2013416 f 2004 Cambridge University Press 379\nPrinted in the United Kingdom\nin certain countries and regions and in certain periods. Besides the unique thematic,\nchronological and regional differences in the essays by Tinsman and Paton, Gould\u2019s\nessay offers an analysis of the politics of ethnic identity and memory after La\nMatanza in western El Salvador in 1932 ; Miller Klubock\u2019s puts the focus on\nthe contours of worker ethnic nationalism, chilenidad, in the context of strikes in the\nCopper Mines in northern Chile in the mid-1940s ; and finally, Grandin examines\nelite Guatemalan\u2019s construction of ethnicity in the aftermath of the Cholera epi-\ndemic of 1837 in Quetzaltenango, a region in the highlands of western Guatemala.\nEach of these essays is well-written, well researched and engages with specific\nhistoriographical problems that stand alone from the specific and major concerns\naddressed by Joseph, Stern, Weinstein and Mallon. The non-historiographical essays\nmerit their own individual evaluation, but space does not allow for this here. As\na whole, though, they all in some way connect to issues and problematic emphasised\nby the historiographical essays. Paton\u2019s concerns interact with Weinstein\u2019s critique\nof the emphasis on slave agency in the most recent historical writing about the\naftermath of abolition in Brazil, to the detriment of some of the advantages of\nmore structuralist approaches found in the Marxist historiography associated with\nViotti da Costa herself, and similar approaches in the Caribbean historiography.\nFinally, Joseph emphasises the extent to which politics beyond the academy\ninfluences the political in history. This issue connects with a major theme in\nMallon\u2019s contribution, namely, the role of the historian and ethnographer in de-\nconstructing and re-constructing local memories complicated by competing claims\nemerging from ethnic, generational, and gender identities, her own and those of her\n\u2018 informants \u2019. (Mallon has been researching these issues among the Mapuche in\nChile since the mid-1990s.) These issues are briefly addressed in the essays by Gould,\nGradin and Mahony because each concretely reflects on how the politics of the\n1980s and 1990s, including their politics as academics, in each of the regions is\nrelevant for understanding the particular issues they write about. In the longest\nessay in the book, and located after Joseph\u2019s more limited characterisation of its\nconcerns and scope, Stern\u2019s contribution conceptualises all the essays when trying to\ncharacterise the sources and implications of the political sensibilities, mostly on\nthe left, of each of the contributors, from the eldest, that is Viotti da Costa, to the\nyoungest, presumably Paton and Grandin.\nD A R I O E U R AQ U ETrinity College Hartford\nJ.

The\n\u2018 interplay of nation, race and gender in Latin America \u2019 hardly needs to be demon-\nstrated. What this valuable collection contains is (i) a useful introductory chapter\nthat provides a discussion of the literature produced in the United States (I will return to\nthis point) on race and nation in Latin America that skilfully weaves in the issues\n380 Reviews\nexamined in the subsequent chapters and helps set an agenda for future research\nand (ii) nine short but very rewarding essays that either draw on already published\nresearch or anticipate forthcoming monographs that illustrate the themes of the\nvolume from a number of locations (Arequipa and Quito, southwestern Colombia,\nPanama, Belize, Cuba, Rio de Janeiro, Sonora and Sao Paulo), periods (spanning the\nlate eighteenth to early twentieth centuries) and approaches. The volume is flanked\nby a foreword by Thomas C. Holt (who provides the non-Latinamericanist\u2019s\nperspective) and an afterword by anthropologist Peter Wade (who provides the\nnon-historian\u2019s perspective).\nThe introductory chapter by Nancy P. Appelbaum, Anne S. Macpherson and\nKarin Alejandra Rosemblatt, the volume\u2019s editors, provides a useful introduction to\nthe literature on race, nation and a number of other themes discussed in the volume.\nDespite its short length, the chapter covers a very broad range of issues in a clear\nand accessible style. In addition to offering a persuasive periodisation of changing\nelite racial thought from the independence wars to the late twentieth century, the\nauthors draw on the existing literature and on the individual contributions to the\nvolume to discuss how notions of space (specifically, regionalism) have influenced\nracial ideas ; how criteria for racial classification have shifted over time and, crucially,\nhow the scientific racism of the later nineteenth and early twentieth century built\non earlier racist ideas (thus contributing to the much needed effort to dispel the\nmyth that racism was invented in the late nineteenth century) ; how nationalist\ndiscourses (always multiple and contested) had to grapple with race leading to the\ninclusion in the nation of some groups (Arab-Brazilians) and the exclusion of others\n(Chinese-Mexicans) ; how concepts of race and nation were gendered in various\nways and how this gendering contributed to the assertion of racial, class, and sexual\nroles ; and finally how discourses on race and nation were also produced by subaltern\nactors, forcing in many cases negotiations regarding the racialised character of\ncitizenship and nationhood. Throughout, the authors attempt to incorporate a\ntransnational dimension to their analysis, and place special emphasis on how\n\u2018the interplay between popular and elite conceptions of race and nation was shaped\nby US imperialism\u2019 ( p. 20).\nThe introductory chapter should be required reading for all students interested\nin the themes of race and nation (and space, and gender, and class, and imperialism)\nin Latin America. However, I was surprised by its US-centredness, and indeed, by\nthe US-centredness of the whole volume. With the exception of Peter Wade (at the\nUniversity of Manchester), all the contributors (some of whom are, admittedly,\nLatin American) are based in US universities. Similarly, almost all the references\nin the notes to the introduction are to articles or books published in the USA by\nUS-based scholars. As a Peruvianist, I was not surprised to find a reference to\nMarisol de la Cadena\u2019s excellent Indigenous Mestizos, but perplexed by the absence\nof any reference to the works of Gonzalo Portocarrero or Nelson Manrique, among\nothers, whose many insights on the \u2018 interplay \u2019 of race and nation in Peru would\nhave informed the authors\u2019 analysis. Perhaps the editors decided to omit (the bulk\nof ) the literature on race and nation in Latin America produced in Latin America\n(and Europe) for valid reasons (lack of space ; an editorial decision to focus on texts\navailable to students in US universities). If so, by making these reasons explicit,\nthey would have strengthened further an already impressive essay. As it stands, one\ncould get the impression that the only literature on race and nation in Latin America\nproduced of late comes exclusively from the United States.\nReviews 381\nLack of space prevents a detailed discussion of the nine other chapters in the\nvolume. They are all very readable and will whet anyone\u2019s appetite for more. How-\never, whereas the introductory chapter succeeds admirably in weaving the themes\nexplored in the individual chapters into its broader analysis of race and nation in\nLatin America, on the whole the individual chapters fail to remit back to the pro-\ngramme of the introduction. The introductory chapter begins with a proposal to\nestablish a difference between race \u2018as a contingent historical phenomenon\u2019, for\nwhich the authors reserve the term \u2018race \u2019 and race \u2018as an analytical category \u2019\nfor which the authors reserve the term \u2018racialisation \u2019 ; the former (\u2018 the meaning of\nrace over time and space in postcolonial Latin America \u2019) being the \u2018subject of our\nhistorical analysis \u2019 while the latter becomes \u2018our conceptual tool \u2019 (p. 2). This differ-\nentiation, the authors claim (revealing again the US-centredness of their approach) :\n\u2018 allows us to move beyond still prevalent debates about whether or not racial dis-\ncrimination exists in Latin America and beyond mechanistic contrasts of US and\nLatin American racial systems \u2019 (p. 3). This differentiation between what we could\ncategorise as the emic and etic understandings of race seems salutary and potentially\nuseful (if, perhaps, not fully explored). Unfortunately, the reading of the individual\nchapters (and a rapid perusal of the index) reveals that with the exception of\nAlexandra Minna Stern, the contributors to the volume have not fully embraced\nthe term \u2018racialisation \u2019. Arguably, the differentiation between race and racialisation\nis evident in the other chapters. But the editors\u2019 campaign to introduce this differ-\nentiation \u2013 and, particularly, the neologism that accompanies it \u2013 to ongoing debates\non race and nation in Latin America would have been considerably enhanced if\nthe contributors to their volume had incorporated it in their analyses.\nP A U L O D R I N O TUniversity of Oxford\nJ.

Ariel de la Fuente has faced the challenge successfully : he\nhas produced an original, well-researched interpretation of caudillismo in Argentina\nduring the central decades of state formation.\nIn Children of Facundo the point of departure is the assertion that \u2018caudillismo\nshould be seen through the followers\u2019 eyes as well as those of the leaders, and to\naccomplish this, historians must focus on the followers\u2019 social conditions and\npolitical culture \u2019 (p. 4). This is precisely what de la Fuente sets about doing. In tune\nwith other recent works that seek to write the history of nation-building \u2018without\nleaving the people out \u2019,1 he puts the followers of the caudillos centre stage. And he\nchooses a specific location for his enterprise : the Argentine province of La Rioja\n1 Gilbert M. Joseph and Daniel Nugent (eds.), Everyday Forms of State Formation : Revolution and\nthe Negotiation of Rule in Modern Mexico (Durham, NC, 1994) p. 12.\n382 Reviews\nbetween 1853 and 1870, the site of important rebellions against the national\ngovernment led by some of the most renowned caudillos of the times. The history\nhe tells, however, transcends these limits. It goes back to the 1820s and \u201930s, to\nthe heyday of Facundo Quiroga, the emblematic figure of Argentine caudillismo ;\nit goes beyond La Rioja, and connects the local struggles with the more general\npolitical conflicts of the period.\nThe book is organised into nine chapters, plus an introduction and a conclusion.\nAfter a first chapter that sets the stage, the subsequent ones gradually introduce\nthe reader into the world of the caudillos\u2019 followers. To look for their traces, de la\nFuente resorts to a wide variety of sources, which he explores thoroughly. He proves\nparticularly innovative when analysing a collection of songs and stories that allow\nhim to delve into the oral culture of the period.\nThe picture he portrays both challenges some of the conventional wisdom on\nhis topic, and offers new insights and some strong interpretations on caudillos\nand caudillismo. De la Fuente starts his book by mapping the political forces of\nLa Rioja, and establishes a clear-cut social division between the two main groups.\nThe party of the \u2018unitarios \u2019 was basically formed by the richest families of the\nagricultural valleys of the Andes, and had the support of the liberal national\ngovernment, while the \u2018 federales \u2019 included the largest landowners of the cattle-\nraising poorer area of the Llanos, plus minor ranchers, peasants and labourers\nof both areas. He claims, therefore, that the majority of the people of La Rioja\nbelonged to the opposition Federalist Party, the party of the caudillos and their\nfollowers, and it is to this last group that he devotes the rest of the book.\nIn the years of the Organizacio\u00b4n Nacional, these federalist caudillos of La Rioja,\nin connection with other similar forces originating in neighbouring provinces,\nlaunched a series of rebellions against the local and the national authorities. They\nsucceeded in recruiting thousands of men, who participated as part of the montoneras,\nand followed their caudillos in their political and military endeavours. In the most\nconvincing part of the book, de la Fuente explores the relationships between\nthe leaders and their men, as well as the reasons and motivations of the latter. He\ndepicts the montonera as a hierarchical, military organisation, integrated by civilians\nof rural origins who joined the groups on specific occasions, but who otherwise\nled a regular life as peasants, labourers, minor hacendados and rancheros. These\nwere neither professional military nor spontaneous rioters. The men followed the\ncaudillos on account of a combination of factors which ranged from economic\nrewards and social protection, to cultural, ethnical, and political identification. De la\nFuente rich portrayal of the gauchos\u2019 customs, beliefs and ideological convictions\nis persuasive. By the end of the book, the federal popular identity has acquired\ndefinite contours and specific meaning.\nDe la Fuente is less convincing when he attempts an overall picture of the conflict\nbetween unitarios and federales, both at the provincial and at the national level.\nThe very name of \u2018unitarios \u2019 to designate the political \u2018other \u2019 of the federales is\nproblematic. It may be useful to convey the view of the caudillos and their followers,\nbut it reduces the complex world of the liberal groups to a label coined forty years\nearlier and already under heavy criticism. This choice of words points to de la\nFuente\u2019s emphasis on continuity. He reads the world of the \u201960s and \u201970s as a\ncontinuation of the previous forty \u2013 a persuasive reading when his subject is the\npopular culture, but certainly a problematic one when he looks at the conflicts in\nthe political realm. In that sense, the whole picture is skewed towards the past,\nReviews 383\nand it is symptomatic that he pays very little attention to the montoneras led by Felipe\nVarela, the last of the powerful riojano caudillos and a less traditional figure than his\npredecessors. These were decades of rapid political and institutional changes, but\nthe last chapter\u2019s attempts to account for these changes feature more as an addition\nto the previous elaborate findings than as an ingrained part of the whole argument.\nThese are, however, minor weaknesses for a ground-breaking book that has\nsucceeded in illuminating a major aspect of caudillismo in Latin America.\nH I L D A S A B A T OUniversidad de Buenos Aires Conicet\nJ.

DOI: 10.1017\/S0022216X04247721\nPablo Lacoste, La imagen del otro en las relaciones de la Argentina y Chile 1534\u20132000\n(Buenos Aires\/Santiago de Chile : Fondo de Cultura Econo\u00b4mica\/Universidad\nde Santiago de Chile, 2003), pp. 443, pb.\nThe Argentine historian Pablo Lacoste has, in recent years, developed a notable\ncorpus of work on Argentina\u2013Chile relations. His studies have been as likely to\nfocus on the development of trans-Andean railway links or motor racing as on\nthe more traditional \u2018high \u2019 politics of foreign policies or international relations.\nUnderpinning all his work, though, has been a concern with rebalancing a histori-\nography of relations between the two republics which has long been predominantly\nconcerned with \u2018high \u2019 politics, traditionally characterising Argentina\u2013Chile relations\nas conflictive and dominated by territorial concerns. In La imagen del otro Lacoste\nturns his attention to the ways in which territorial competition has been placed at\nthe centre of Argentine\u2013Chileanmutual perceptions since the late nineteenth century.\nLacoste sets out from the premise that despite good relations between the two\ncountries from the late 1980\u2019s onwards, chauvinistic visions of Argentines towards\nChileans \u2013 and vice versa \u2013 are still clearly present, and influential, in both countries.\nThe roots of these chauvinistic perceptions are to be found in the territorial\nhistory of the two countries, specifically with regard to their mutual border. From a\nstarting point in 1534, Lacoste analyses Argentine and Chilean attitudes towards the\nborder, examining the constant reshaping of the border in the realm of the judicial,\nthe real, and the imaginary. In this long-run history, the late nineteenth and early\ntwentieth centuries are highlighted as the key period in which the shaping of con-\nflictive views of opposing territorial ambitions were first coherently developed.\nFrom this period emerged the theses of a \u2018bi-oceanic Argentina \u2019, and of a Chile\nwhich laid claim to all of Patagonia, drawn from erroneous or wilfully misleading\nreadings of colonial territorial history. As Lacoste details, these views did not emerge\nspontaneously, but were constructed from nationalist bases on both sides of the\ncordillera, and became part of the \u2018national foundational theses \u2019 in both countries.\nIt is with these perceptions that Lacoste engages most extensively, examining the\nfallacious perceptions of their national borders forwarded by both Argentine and\nChilean historians throughout the twentieth century. Lacoste highlights the insertion\nof such views into both national educational content and the broader public domain\nas key to the development of xenophobia between the two countries from the late\nnineteenth century onward. The author\u2019s position with regard to such erroneous\nhistory is concisely expressed in his observation that \u2018 someone lied in the historians\nunion\u2019 (p. 15). Whilst doubtless generations of Argentine and Chilean historians\nwould reject such allegations, Lacoste amply supports his contention, leaving little\ndoubt that the \u2018 fantastic \u2019 projections of the borders of the two countries proposed\n384 Reviews\nby such histories has resulted both in xenophobic attitudes and has during some\nperiods \u2013 often but not always during times of excessive military influence over\ngovernment \u2013 corraled interstate relations within a highly sensitised territorial\ndiscourse.\nAs Lacoste points out, the production of such histories diminished notably in\nthe post-1984 period, as the majority of academic and diplomatic institutions\nadapted themselves to the reinvigorated bilateral integration initiated by the 1984\nTreaty of Peace and Friendship between the two countries. However, it is also true\nthat the early and mid 1990s saw an upsurge of nationalist territorial works, often\ncommissioned by nationalist bodies such as the Argentine C\u0131\u00b4rculo Militar. Lacoste\ncorrectly identifies Mosquera\u2019s La conciencia territorial argentina y el Tratado con Chile\n1881\u201393 : una censurable custodia del patrimonio territorial argentino, as the most notable\nof these works. Mosquera\u2019s study, though, is only one of a stream of misleading\nterritorial histories on both sides of the border in the 1990s, produced in direct\nresponse to both governments attempts at resolving the border in the Laguna del\nDesierto and Hielos Continentales zones of the far southern Andes. Although these\nissues were eventually resolved successfully, the continuing appearance of nationalist\nreadings of territorial history was a contributory factor to the longevity of the Hielos\nContinentales controversy in Argentina, complicating the ratification attempts of the\nArgentine government from 1991 until the very end of Menem\u2019s mandate in 1999.\nThe example of that particular political controversy substantiates Lacoste\u2019s premise\nthat the manipulation of territorial history has tended to sharpen chauvinistic\nnationalism on both sides of the border. Fortunately, in the case of the territorial\ndebates of the 1990\u2019s, that chauvinism was neither as widespread nor as influential\nas proponents of that decades territorial accords \u2013 such as Argentine Foreign\nMinister Guido di Tella \u2013 feared.\nLacoste\u2019s work is a welcome addition to studies of Argentine\u2013Chilean relations,\npart of a growing revisionist view of that history to which a diverse range of scholars\nincluding Romero, Escude\u00b4 and others have contributed. Whilst not the first work\nto shed fresh light on that history, it is the first extensively to analyse the linkages\nbetween historically engendered territorial \u2018myths \u2019, and the development of xeno-\nphobic currents between Argentina and Chile. It is, then, a valuable counterweight to\nthe plethora of nationalist works on Argentine\u2013Chilean relations produced through-\nout the twentieth century, and a timely reminder that despite the generally harmoni-\nous condition of Argentine\u2013Chilean relations in recent years, analysts and students\nshould not overlook the long-term effects of nationalist historiography on those re-\nlations. It is to be hoped that La imagen del otro will be taken up as a key text by those\nwho read and teach Argentina\u2013Chile relations, and more broadly by analysts with an\ninterest in the interaction of territory, history and nationalism in Latin America.\nL A U R E N C E A L L A NInstitute of Latin American Studies, London\nJ.

Menem was generally able to contain dissent within his party, leading\nto the adoption and consolidation of an impressive list of market-oriented policies,\nwhile Pe\u00b4rez\u2019s copartisans abandoned his reform programme, eventually leading\nto his premature departure from office. In short, Corrales argues that successful\nintraparty relations are the key to governing, particularly in the context of severe\neconomic crisis.\nThe book is divided into four sections. The first outlines Corrales\u2019 theory re-\ngarding the importance of state strength. He argues that other potential explanations\nfor reform such as economic crisis, public opposition, interest group opposition,\nand the success of the programme do not explain Menem\u2019s success and Pe\u00b4rez\u2019s\nfailure. Instead, cooperation between the executive and his copartisans in the legis-\nlature neutralise society\u2019s resistance to reforms. However, when the president\u2019s\ncopartisans abandon him he is left with little choice but to roll back reforms or\nengage in an \u2018autogolpe \u2019.\nThe second section details the cases selected and the data used in the analysis.\nArgentina and Venezuela represent the \u2018populist-corporatist \u2019 tradition in Latin\nAmerica of a large, though incompetent state, yet they are somewhat distinct\n(wealthy, strong, ideologically vague parties, outsider candidates). He makes a\n\u2018necessary, but insufficient \u2019 argument regarding the importance of strong political\nparties, copartisan control of the legislature, and populist traditions that undermine\nthe generalisability of the theory, although he attempts that in the final section. This\nis a most-similar-systems approach, with Corrales drawing upon elite interviews and\ndetailed case studies to test his hypotheses concerning the importance of intraparty\nrelations.\nThe third section forms the bulk of the analysis. Corrales demonstrates\nthat copartisans in both nations initially provided qualified support for reform\nefforts, but that congressional consultation was nearly non-existent and that over\ntime co-partisans in both countries began to resist executive initiatives. How-\never, the Pe\u00b4rez administration continued its non-consultative approach leading\nhis party (AD) to turn against its president for the first time in history. AD\u2019s\ninfighting created a power vacuum, leading to two attempted coups, declining\napproval ratings, fiscally irresponsible attempts to regain support, and eventually\nto Pe\u00b4rez\u2019s removal from office and the reversal of many reforms. Conversely,\nas congressional resistance grew in Menem\u2019s Peronist Party (PJ) the president\nreshuffled his cabinet, sent key economic advisers to consult with congress, gave\nPJ governors greater autonomy, and let congress modify or halt some reform\nefforts. This harmonious process sustained reform efforts and eventually to a\nconstitutional amendment that enabled Menem to win re-election. Only when\nMenem sought a third term in office did this consultative relationship break-\ndown.\nWhy did AD abandon its president, while the PJ did not? Corrales argues that\nparty polarisation actually facilitated the process. Members of the PJ could not\n386 Reviews\ncredibly side with the hated UCR, while AD dissidents could side with the Christian-\nDemocratic COPEI \u2013 given the long history of cooperation between the parties.\nFurthermore, Corrales claims that AD\u2019s moribund elite, the lack of internal\ndemocracy, and its electoral dominance made leaders extremely reluctant to aban-\ndon a four-decade old economic strategy that had produced electoral success in\nthe past. Conversely, the PJ\u2019s more fluid party elite, internal competition for office,\nand most importantly electoral defeats in 1983 and 1985 led the party faithful to be\nmore willing to compromise. Consequently, when Pe\u00b4rez signalled willingness to\ncompromise his fate was already sealed, while members of the PJ were more willing\nto work to defend their president once he sent similar signals.\nThe final section attempts to test the theory regarding the role of intraparty\ncooperation in a variety of Latin American states using short case studies and pro-\nvides a useful summary of the theory and findings. The region-wide test is based\non brief case studies of various governments, with all cases supporting the theory.\nCorrales\u2019 conclusion is novel. Unlike previous work claiming that executive auton-\nomy explains the extent of reform he instead finds that the key to sustainable reform\nis a moderately powerful president. Presidents must have sufficient power to pro-\nmote reform efforts, but not so much that the concerns of co-partisans in the\nlegislature are ignored.\nCorrales\u2019 conclusions are undermined somewhat by his approach. First, he argues\nthat polarised parties with elite turnover and both internal and external competition\nfor office are essential in securing intraparty cooperation, yet his model is over-\ndetermined given the number of observations. Secondly, early on he argues that\nthe worst possible outcome for a party is a failed administration, yet he clearly\ndemonstrates that AD \u2018_ led the firing squad\u2019. Why would they do this if it\nproduced the worst possible outcome? Thirdly, he uses an elite survey to show\nmembers of the PJ felt consulted and members of AD did not, yet this was con-\nducted in 1994. Menem\u2019s success and Pe\u00b4rez\u2019s humiliating exit may be less a function\nof consultation and more a function of political and economic outcomes. Finally,\nthe number of factors apparently necessary to elicit co-partisan support in the\npursuit of market-oriented reforms in Latin America is prohibitive and his definition\nof co-partisan support in his region-wide analysis is so malleable to make further\ntesting difficult. Still, this is a first-rate application of historical-institutionalism\nand provides an excellent history of the reform process in Argentina and Venezuela\nduring the late 1980s and early 1990s.\nG R E GG B.

First she\ndescribes ethnographically the trekking way of life of these Amazonian hunter-\ngatherers incorporating into the analysis their own social and symbolic structuring\nof the world. Secondly, she contributes to the theoretical development of historical\necology as a research approach. Both aims are concomitant and both go against\nwhat has been the norm in the treatment of Amazonian trekker societies. All too\nReviews 387\noften the scholarship devoted to these societies has echoed popular representations\nof Amazonian foragers as relentless murderers and savages lacking the cultural\nelaboration ascribed to cultivators. Adaptive approaches that saw hunting-gathering\nas imposed by a limiting environment, and their cultural ecological substitutes in\nwhich foraging is seen as the result of post-contact cultural regression, reproduce\nand reinforce these views. Furthermore, the Huaorani were supposed to share with\nother Amazonian groups who experience endemic warfare, a social reproduction\nstrategy in which alterity and predation are the driving mechanisms symbolically\nto incorporate life into an essentially infertile inside. Rival, by convincingly bringing\ntogether history, political and economic analysis of social relations (both inter- and\nintra-ethnic), and interpretation of cosmological themes, takes these arguments to\ntask.\nThe bulk of the monograph is devoted to show how autonomy and isolationism,\ninstead of being imposed by external forces, constitute an ethos central to what\nit means to be huaorani (i.e. human). Social relations within the nanicabo (the\nHuaorani longhouse) are reproduced through the continuous sharing of the forest\u2019s\nnatural abundance. \u2018Demand sharing \u2019, or sharing on demand rather than obliged\nby reciprocity, does not create creditors nor debtors ; Rival sees this as related to\nthe radical egalitarianism that characterises some trekking societies. Likewise, this\nsharing stance articulates history, since natural abundance is regarded as the conse-\nquence of past human activity. Of particular interest for Amazonian anthropology\nis Rival\u2019s reversion of the \u2018predation hypothesis \u2019. Although the Huaorani, like other\nforest peoples, symbolically structure the world around a predator-prey duality,\nthey do so by assuming a fixed subject position of prey. Isolationism, flight and\nkilling \u2018others \u2019, then, are different ways of dealing with an ever threatening predatory\noutside without resorting to its logic.\nThe book starts with a critical review of different approaches to explain trekking\nin Amazonia. On the one hand, those emphasising either post-contact cultural\nregression or functional adaptation according to cost\/benefit criteria, and on the\nother hand, ethno-historical accounts that focus on relations between neighbouring\ngroups with different subsistence strategies. Historical ecology is presented as\nbridging these approaches and overcoming some of their limitations. Rival adopts\nthis framework, refining it by accounting for internal sociocultural processes and\nadopting a subjective perspective. Consistent with the model proposed, the work\ncontinues with a summary of the ethnohistory of the Upper Napo Region, which\nis then contrasted with Huaorani\u2019s own understanding of history and inter-ethnic\nrelations. Rival argues that extensive human abduction and endemic warfare in the\nregion created the conditions for \u2018 isolation [to become] an essential component of\nidentity and ethnicity \u2019 (p. 44). In my view, the argument that Huaorani isolationism\nhas persisted unchanged from pre-Columbian times until a present in which\ntourism, oil industry and the state are palpable realities, only holds if we ascribe\nto the author\u2019s idealisation of mobility and autonomy. The latter is also evident in\npassages on how \u2018economic development forced [the Kayapo\u00b4] to give up their\ntranshumant way of life \u2019 (p. 16), or why some Huaorani groups \u2018have been pushed\nto accept_ a sedentary existence \u2019 (p. 175), denying thus the political choice that\nthese processes \u2013 like isolationism and trekking \u2013 involve. However, the relation-\nship established between the history of inter-ethnic relations, the self-identification\nas prey in face of a predatory context, and an isolationist ethos and mobility,\nis original and compelling. As strong is the ethnographic treatment of sociopolitical\n388 Reviews\nand symbolic relationships between and within independent nanicabos, and between\nnanicabos, the forest and past generations through which the notions of natural\nabundance and demand sharing are developed. Particularly enjoyable is the de-\nscription of the drinking-festivals where marriage alliances are established. During\nthese festivals, which require hard work and cooperation between related but\ndistant nanicabos, the host couple is ritually transformed into a fruiting, naturally\ngiving tree. Such naturalisation that allows participants to recover their autonomy\nafter the festival \u2013 and this is other of the book\u2019s central tenets \u2013 is also how the\nHuaorani conceptualise oil companies and state schools, incorporating them into\ntheir economy and social world while remaining independent : as natural fountains\nof wealth. This representation of \u2018marginality with a difference \u2019, as the author calls\nit elsewhere, as well as the adoption of a theoretical model which acknowledges\nagency and choice in people\u2019s trajectories, appear all the more important if we\nexamine the reasons that have legitimised imperial enterprises, christianising mis-\nsions, internal colonialism and messianic development schemes in the Amazon.\nA N D R E\u00b4 S V A L L E J O E S P I N O S AGeography Department, Cambridge University\nJ.

Krippner-Mart\u0131\u00b4nez\u2019s is a recent addition, which tackles\nsome common aspects of the history of early colonial Michoaca\u00b4n with a refreshing\nperspective.\nReflections on the evangelisation and early politics of Michoaca\u00b4n are presented\nin a series of essays divided into two parts. In the first, \u2018The Politics of Conquest \u2019,\nconsisting of three chapters, some well-known primary sources are analysed and\nreinterpreted. The author starts with a discussion of the lawsuit that ended in the\nexecution of the Cazonci, the indigenous ruler, by Nun\u02dco de Guzma\u00b4n in 1530. The\nProceso is followed by the Relacio\u00b4n de Michoaca\u00b4n of 1541, an account by elite indigen-\nous males transcribed and translated by a Franciscan, through which the inter-\nactions of the Franciscans and the indigenous people are analysed. This part ends\nwith a discussion of the writings left by bishop Vasco de Quiroga. The second part,\n\u2018Reflections \u2019, investigates some effects that those events and writings provoked\nin later times. A chapter is dedicated to the Cro\u00b4nica de Michoaca\u00b4n of friar Pablo\nBeaumont, a late eighteenth-century account of the first stage of conquest and\nevangelisation. The last chapter deals with the emergence of Vasco de Quiroga\nas a prominent figure from the late eighteenth to the twentieth centuries. The\nauthor\u2019s general aim is to give a fresh interpretation of some important sources\nand demonstrate the role of power and politics in the history of early colonial\nMichoaca\u00b4n.\nMany aspects of the book stimulate reflection and analysis ; here I have chosen\nto concentrate on two figures that could symbolise, in my view, the early history\nof Michoaca\u00b4n itself. The Cazonci Tzintzincha Tangaxoan was executed by Nun\u02dco de\nGuzma\u00b4n and Spanish soldiers and settlers, after a trial that generated an extremely\ninteresting judicial record. Despite the recognised limitations of the source, such as\nReviews 389\nthe exclusive representation of the Spanish point of view, and the fact that Spaniards\ncould hardly translate Tarascan at that time (they used Nahuatl as a lingua franca), the\nlawsuit is crucial in revealing the dynamics of colonisation. Challenging traditional\nrepresentations of the conquest of the region that underscore indigenous passivity\nand rapid acceptance of the Spanish presence, the author gives a multifaceted\ninterpretation of the lawsuit. First, the Cazonci did not surrender to colonial rule,\nbut attempted to exploit Spanish factionalism and at last fell victim to contention\nbetween Corte\u00b4s and Guzma\u00b4n. Moreover, Spanish settlers were frustrated by the\nauthority of the Cazonci and determined to eliminate him to establish themselves\nfreely. In this light, the execution becomes more understandable, but there is a\nfurther step in the process. The Spanish needed a justification, as with the general\nenterprise of conquest, and that necessity was met by the construction of the\nCazonci as a \u2018perverse and murderous other \u2019 (p. 21). Through the humiliation\nand public execution of the Cazonci, the Spanish settlers affirmed their authority\nunder the logic of dominance and control, a brutal but sadly unexceptional rationale.\nThis complex portrait of power and politics is a definite achievement of the author.\nThe second figure I choose is the famous Vasco de Quiroga, first bishop of\nMichoacan (1538\u201365). Quite a lot has been written on him, yet Krippner-Mart\u0131\u00b4nez\nmanages to provide some original ideas by stressing the ambiguities and nuances\nof Quiroga\u2019s conceptions, rather than his now traditional role as protector of the\nindigenous people. For instance, while giving shelter to the natives in his hospitales,\nhe imposed a social order based on dominant male authority and the power of\nrank. After all, he was more traditional than is normally acknowledged, and his\nconceptions of social hierarchy and cultural superiority were not exceptional for\nthe time. Moreover, the author suggests that the image of Vasco de Quiroga as a\nfather beloved by the natives was born after the fact out of the necessity first of\nthe colonial state and later of Mexican nationalism. Indeed, there is no evidence to\nshow the attachment of sixteenth-century natives to the bishop, and some doubt\nis legitimate if we remember that Quiroga never learnt the indigenous language in\norder to communicate with them.\nThrough these five essays the author places some well-known written records in\na better understood historical context, a most worthy undertaking. Moreover, he\nleaves us needing to rethink on the one hand the image of Quiroga as a successful\nmissionary beloved by the natives, and on the other the image of the natives as\nlimited to being passive recipients or active opponents. Stimulating debate over\ntoo-easily-accepted paradigms is one of the achievements of a good book.\nC A T E R I N A P I Z Z I G ON IInstitute of Latin American Studies, London\nJ. Lat. Amer.

It must also\nbe a sanitary and disease-free city, displaying the accomplishments of modern sci-\nence. The focus of the monumental project was the grand boulevard constructed\nby Emperor Maximilian to connect the city with Chapultepec Palace, and reborn as\nthe Paseo de la Reforma, lined with numerous statues, the monument to Indepen-\ndence (\u2018El Angel \u2019), and culminating in the monument to Benito Jua\u00b4rez (purposely\nplaced beyond the Paseo so he would not compete with his former nemesis, Porfirio\nD\u0131\u00b4az). Agostoni devotes some particularly interesting pages to the creation of the\nmonuments to Cuauhte\u00b4moc (1877) and to Kings Ahu\u0131\u00b4tzotl and Itzco\u00b4atl. These\nlatter two colossal statues of green oxidised bronze, known popularly as the \u2018Indios\nVerdes \u2019, were much-reviled and ridiculed, and ultimately moved from the \u2018modern\u2019\nPaseo to a poor and non-sanitised section of the city in 1907.\nThe major public health and sanitation project was the culmination of the cen-\nturies-long effort to drain Lake Texcoco, which flooded periodically, polluting\nmuch of the city and making it one of the most disease-ridden in the world. The\nfinal plan, consisting of canals and tunnels directing water north and ultimately\nto the Gulf of Mexico, was begun in 1885, based on a plan of 1856, and finally\ninaugurated in 1900. The project also included a system of sewers. This project to\n\u2018control water \u2019 always involved a parallel campaign of citizen improvement, that\nis, to create a \u2018hygienic instinct \u2019 among the lower classes.\nAgostoni\u2019s study is based on a wide range of contemporary published materials\n(including novelistic descriptions of the diseased city by Emilio Rabasa and Fernando\nGamboa), newspapers, the Ayuntamiento and Ministry of Health archives, as well as\non an intelligent use of secondary literature.\nOne of the strengths of the study is Agostoni\u2019s emphasis on continuity, since the\nPorfirian projects drew inspiration from the late colonial urbanism of the Viceroy\nRevillagigedo, and on efforts to control flooding dating from the seventeenth century.\nAfter 1910, despite the new concern for removing social inequalities, Agostoni\nsuggests that the revolutionary governments maintained the basic urban policies of\nthe Porfiriato. The motto merely shifted from \u2018order and progress \u2019 to \u2018 reconstruc-\ntion. \u2019 However, she does call attention to the need for more work on twentieth-\ncentury continuities along other suggestions for future research.\nAgostoni points out that the D\u0131\u00b4az regime, despite its focus on public health,\nessentially divided the city between the modern section of the west and south, with\nits boulevards, monuments, and new colonias, and the poor eastern section adjacent\nto Lake Texcoco. One Porfirian goal was to display the modern metropolis to\nforeign visitors, dignitaries, and investors at the 1910 Centennial celebration, which\nmeant that \u2018monumental space had to be clean. \u2019 For example, there was the effort\nto \u2018camouflage \u2019 the indigenous poor by insisting that all those attending the inaug-\nuration of the monument to Independence wear shoes and be properly dressed.\nMoreover, the Cuauhte\u00b4moc statue was not conceived, Agostoni tells us, to show\nethnic pride, but rather to honour a mythical ancient past and imperial order. While\namply noting the social limitations of the elite Porfirian mentality, Agostoni\u2019s study\ndoes add to the revisionist literature on the Porfiriato. In a sense, the metropolis\nReviews 391\nof today owes much of its character to the ambitious Porfirian projects. The book\nalso uncovers the brilliant work of often-forgotten planners, engineers, hygienists\nand scientists of the era, as well as the highly organised bureaucracy of the Consejo\nSuperior de Salubridad. In short, Claudia Agostoni has given us a balanced and\nnuanced view of an important aspect of Mexico in the era of Porfirio D\u0131\u00b4az.\nC H A R L E S A. H A L EUniversity of Iowa\nJ. Lat.

Despite the\ngrowth of women\u2019s studies and gender studies with a Latin American perspective,\nthere has not been a monograph on women\u2019s role in Mexican politics. In attempting\nto fill this gap, Rodr\u0131\u00b4guez has focused on the lives of women in the institutional\npolitical sphere, specifically those in parties, NGOs, first ladies and bureaucracies.\nThe book begins by explaining the methodological approach and then offers some\ncontext on the Mexican political system and women\u2019s insertion into political life\nin the twentieth century. It moves on to assessing the development of the women\u2019s\nmovement in Mexico, women\u2019s role in public office, their participation in the elec-\ntoral process, and concludes with an assessment of Mexican democracy in the light\nof women\u2019s increased and more visible participation. The chapters are on the long\nside, but the good use of subheads does allow the reader to hone in on particular\nsections should s\/he wish. Rodr\u0131\u00b4guez paints a picture of women\u2019s gradual inclusion\ninto political life and underscores how political institutions themselves, particularly\nparties, have often served to limit women both as actors and in promoting women\u2019s\ngender interests. She further notes that, although there are encouraging signs with\nwomen making cross-party alliances and increasing linkages between state and civil\nsociety, it remains difficult for women to be openly feminist in their approach if\nthey wish to develop a high profile political life, particularly in electoral politics. The\nbook is a mixture of positive and more pessimistic assessment. Rodr\u0131\u00b4guez is keen\nto highlight the genuine advances that women have made, but there is a frequently\nunspoken frustration at how slow progress can be. This slowness is sometimes a\nresult of the institutional obstacles mentioned above, but is also due to personal\nantipathy and rifts, lack of political savvy and personal ambition which has led to\nsome not being as \u2018 sisterly \u2019 as they might. The more sober analysis of the concluding\nchapter has greater impact coming after the more upbeat tenor of the preceding\nchapters.\nThe key strength of this book is the extraordinary access Rodr\u0131\u00b4guez had with her\ninterviewees. She was fortunate to be able to establish teams to work with women\nthroughout the country and to be able to interview people on several occasions.\nIndeed, many of the women allowed themselves to be shadowed and opened up\ntheir homes to Rodr\u0131\u00b4guez and her team. Consequently, the empirical material\nis extremely rich as the interviewees exposed and reflected upon their experiences.\nAs such, we get many insights usually missing from academic analyses and\nRodr\u0131\u00b4guez has also been assiduous in including material from secondary sources\nto give a holistic picture of attitudes towards women in contemporary Mexican\npolitics. This level of access, however, brings with it its own problems. Rodr\u0131\u00b4guez\n392 Reviews\nhas not only established an excellent rapport with the interviewees, many have\nbecome her friends. There are times when the reader senses that these friendships\nhave inhibited her from making some criticisms or to side-step uncomfortable\ndetails : this is particularly noticeable when referring to the difficult relationship\nbetween Dulce Mar\u0131\u00b4a Sauri and Ana Rosa Payan and more so when alluding to\nthe strains that became apparent in the association between Rosario Robles and\nAmalia Garc\u0131\u00b4a. It is difficult to see how this problem can be avoided altogether\nand is a useful illustration of the challenges of ethnographic methodology.\nThere is much to engage with here ; whether one is interested in Mexican politics,\nprocesses of democratisation, or gender studies, this book has a great deal to offer.\nThere are some useful comparisons with the USA to give the broader picture,\nalthough the inclusion of other Latin American countries is less evident and this\ncould have proved helpful as well. It is inevitable, perhaps, that when a book is\nplugging such a large gap that readers would wish for things to be included that\nare not there. The perspective is generally elite-oriented : there is some discussion\nof social movements, but on the whole this is about institutional politics and\nexplorations about what \u2018ordinary \u2019 women might want from their representatives\nare largely absent \u2013 indeed this is an area for future research. There were also missed\nopportunities to theorise more on the rich empirical data. There is a useful dis-\ncussion of democratic theory at the outset, but it is not then used as a theoretical\nframework for the book. Similarly I would have welcomed greater interrogation of\ngender interests and the public-private implications of increase female participation.\nNotwithstanding these points, this is a very enjoyable book that is an important\ncontribution to our understanding of both Mexican politics and women\u2019s political\nparticipation.\nN I K K I C R A S K EUniversity of Liverpool\nJ.

The most memorable of the photographs are perhaps \u2018Barda\ntirada en un campo verde \u2019 (p. 61), of an undulating colonial wall, clinging to the\nland like a serpent ; \u2018Actriz de La Escondida \u2019 (p. 121), an unsettlingly voyeuristic\nportrait of an apparently sleeping actress in indigenous clothing ; \u2018Encuentro Musi-\ncal \u2019 (p. 119), in which instruments left to stand by indigenous musicians form\nmajestic shadows and silhouettes against the hazy sunlight at the top of a hill ; and\n\u2018Muro en ruinas \u2019 (p. 174), of a section of a ruined colonial building which resembles\nan Aztec mask in Rulfo\u2019s choice of light and angle.\nThe arrangement by theme allows the viewer to dwell on aspects of each and\ntheir relationships with each other, observing Rulfo\u2019s freeze-dried images with\nincreasing inquisitiveness, and perhaps taking on the challenge that Carlos\nFuentes sets out for us in the superb opening essay, \u2018Forms that defy oblivion \u2019 :\n\u2018With Rulfo one must always be alert and ask, Why such calm, such beauty, such\nlight? We must question the shadows of that light, the restlessness behind such\nserenity \u2019 (p. 14). In \u2018 Juan Rulfo : Vocation of Silence \u2019, Jorge Alberto Lozoya\nagrees, suggesting that Rulfo\u2019s photographs are representations of a deceptive\nsilence in which \u2018he discourages the unwary \u2019 (p. 24). Drawing parallels between\nMexico and Japan, Alberto Lozoya argues eloquently for the eloquence of silence\nin art while Fuentes eulogises Rulfo\u2019s portraits of indigenous people, which\ntranscend the limitations of space and time by silently displaying a defiant \u2018dig-\nnity \u2019 : \u2018_ a love that has decided not to be buried \u2013 just the opposite of Pedro\nPa\u00b4ramo \u2013 in order to demonstrate the persistence of dignity through time\u2019 (p. 15).\nA dignity that is borne out, perhaps, by images such as Campesina de Oaxaca y\nNin\u02dco (p. 90), in which a woman struggles to work in a field while carrying a\ncrying child.\nOn the other hand, for Eduardo Rivera, in his excellent piece \u2018 Juan Rulfo :\nWriting Light and Photographing Word \u2019, this image would more simply represent\na \u2018denunciation of a \u2018\u2018 justice \u2019\u2019 that vents its cruelty upon the weak \u2019 (p. 30). Apart\nfrom reaffirming the socio-political significance of Rulfo\u2019s photography, Rivera\nalso makes a convincing case for the relationship between fiction and photography,\nexpounding on the \u2018photographic poetics \u2019 of Rulfo\u2019s use of recurring signs such\nas ruined houses, broken windows, scorched fields, empty landscapes, exploited\nwomen and mournful gazes. Margo Glantz\u2019s piece on photographic imagery in Pedro\nPa\u00b4ramo strengthens the case for the link with examples of photographic imagery\nin the novel and, interestingly, the suggestion that Rulfo\u2019s written and visual images\nwork in the same way as the darkness of the human pupil, absorbing light but\nnot releasing it, like a \u2018negative sun \u2019 (p. 18). Against such determined efforts to\nreconcile Rulfo\u2019s photography with his writing, V\u0131\u00b4ctor Jime\u00b4nez sounds an important\nnote of caution in his essay \u2018 Juan Rulfo\u2019s Mexico \u2019, urging us not to ignore \u2018 the\nspecific rules that pertain to each [art form] \u2019 (p. 34). Pleasingly, the last of the essays,\n\u2018 Juan Rulfo : Images of Memory \u2019 by Erika Billeter, seems to heed this caution,\nexpertly placing Rulfo in the context of his contemporary photographers while\nre-asserting, after Jime\u00b4nez, the undeniable influence of an obsession with history\nand architecture on Rulfo\u2019s photography.\nThe calibre of Rulfo\u2019s photographs is now undisputed but the thought-provoking\nand perceptive essays here complement and contextualise them admirably. This\nbook is highly recommended for aficionados of Rulfo\u2019s work in both literature\nand photography, and also for those interested in photography in general.\nA M I T T H AK K A RUniversity of Liverpool\n394 Reviews\nJ.

DOI: 10.1017\/S0022216X04317724\nMaria Victoria Murillo, Labor Unions, Partisan Coalitions, and Market Reforms in\nLatin America (Cambridge : Cambridge University Press, 2001), pp. xvii+250,\n$59.95, $21.95 pb.\nThe tilt toward market-oriented economic development strategies created multiple\nchallenges for workers throughout Latin America during the 1980s and 1990s.\nThis shift posed especially complex dilemmas where radical policy changes were\nimplemented by governments led by political parties with historically close ties to\norganised labour, such as the Partido Justicialista (PJ) in Argentina, the Partido\nRevolucionario Institutional (PRI) in Mexico, and Accio\u00b4n Democra\u00b4tica (AD) in\nVenezuela. Yet organised labour\u2019s response to these changes varied not only across\ncountries but within them as well. In this book, Maria Victoria Murillo seeks to\nexplain why unions generally acquiesced to economic liberalisation in Argentina\nand Mexico (thereby smoothing the implementation of far-reaching reforms) but\nmounted strong opposition to such policies in Venezuela (thereby slowing the reform\nprocess and weakening the government in power).\nMurillo\u2019s principal variables for assessing union\u2013government interactions are\npartisan loyalty between organised labour and the governing party, competition\nbetween incumbent and rival union leaders, and competition among labour organ-\nisations for members and resources. Her main propositions are derived from the\nfollowing (rational-expectation) assumptions :\nUnions do not probe allied governments nor do they bluff. Labor unions trust their\nallies, and union competition or monopoly provides signals of their strength and make\nprobing and bluffing unnecessary. Militancy results from the internal dynamics of the\nunion and the leadership\u2019s search for political survival, whereas the organizational\nstructure of unions affects their ability to obtain concessions (p. 13).\nOf course, it is not difficult to recall real-world situations that substantially depart\nfrom most or all of these assumptions ; the relevant question is how well Murillo\u2019s\nindependent variables explain patterns of union-government interaction in the cases\nshe chooses for close examination.\nMurillo\u2019s study usefully highlights the macro and micro political contexts in\nwhich Argentine, Mexican and Venezuelan workers confronted the challenges of\nmarket-oriented economic reform. The claim that her propositions constitute a new\n\u2018theory \u2019 of government-union interactions is too ambitious, but her hypothesised\ncausal relationships constitute a clear basis for cross-national and cross-sectoral\ncomparison. The book draws upon both the extensive secondary literature on labour\npolitics and economic reform in Latin America and, particularly in its assessment of\nthe Argentine experience, a considerable body of primary field research materials.\nIn her analysis of labour\u2019s response to economic liberalisation during the 1980s\nand 1990s, Murillo shows that in Venezuela the competitive pressures produced\nwithin unions by the rapid expansion of Causa R contributed to AD-affiliated union\nleaders\u2019 growing militancy (although, in the absence of more specific information\nconcerning the scale of this partisan competition, it is difficult to judge the relative\nsignificance of this factor in shaping labour behavior). In the case of Argentina,\nMurillo highlights both the costs that workers paid because of internal divisions\nwithin the General Confederation of Labour (CGT) and the extensive concessions\nthat a reunited CGT and its affiliates wrested from the government of Carlos\nMenem after 1992.\nReviews 395\nIt is, however, the Mexican case that poses the greatest difficulties for Murillo\u2019s\nanalytical framework. Although her approach emphasises the importance of political\ncompetition (and includes such assumptions as \u2018The identity of the party in\ngovernment changes with elections \u2019, p. 19), Murillo is compelled to recognise that\nit was principally the \u2018nondemocratic character of the Mexican regime \u2019 that per-\nmitted government officials to implement policies that harmed workers\u2019 economic\nand social interests. Leadership challenges within the National Education Workers\u2019\nUnion may well have contributed to the union\u2019s comparatively militant policy\nstance, but Murillo does not produce any substantial evidence that growing electoral\ncompetition at the national or state level led to heightened partisan rivalries within\nunions. Government officials did indeed seek to undercut union opposition by\nplaying upon organisational rivalries within the labour movement. Yet this was\nonly one of several reasons why the PRI-allied Confederation of Mexican Workers\n(CTM) generally acquiesced to market-oriented economic reforms \u2013 and evidence\nfrom other sources suggests that, despite government hostility and some member-\nship defections, the CTM actually increased its share of the unionised workforce\nduring the 1990s.\nIn assessing government-labour interactions in Mexico, Murillo underestimates\nthe importance of the CTM\u2019s successful defence of existing federal labour law,\nwhile she overestimates the significance of contacts between more politically\nindependent labour groups and the centre-left Party of the Democratic Revolution\n(PRD). And given that the CTM strongly opposed Carlos Salinas de Gortari\u2019s\npresidential nomination, and that major segments of the organised labour move-\nment were systematically marginalised in key policy debates during Salinas\u2019s years\nin power (1988\u20131994), how meaningful is it to characterise Salinas\u2019s technocratic\ngovernment as a \u2018 labor-based administration \u2019 (p. 8) or to view this case as an in-\nstance in which labour faced the dilemma of responding to unfavourable economic\nmeasures introduced by a partisan ally in government (p. 197)?\nIn addition to these specific difficulties, the book is flawed in two more general\nways. Perhaps the most problematic element is the author\u2019s handling of case\nmaterials. In seeking to avoid the alleged methodological weakness of many com-\nparative political studies (that is, the small number of cases examined), Murillo\nstrives to expand the size of her \u2018 sample \u2019 across different countries, economic\nsectors, and types of labour organisation. In the book\u2019s summary table (p. 194),\nfor example, she reports that the expected outcome occurred in 32 of the 36\n\u2018observations \u2019 fitting her main explanatory conditions.\nMethodological rigour is certainly a worthy goal, and there is no doubt about\nthe potential value of combining national-level analysis with attention to develop-\nments at the sectoral and union levels. However, the result in this instance is a series\nof cameo case studies (averaging just 4\u20135 paragraphs each) that are insufficiently\ndetailed either to illuminate the key relationships being examined or to provide\nthe reader with the empirical basis for judging whether the author\u2019s preferred\nexplanation is in fact superior to various alternatives. Labour leaders are often the\nonly actors appearing in these accounts ; only rarely is there any discussion of how\ngovernment policies or negotiations, or the specific actions of state-firm managers\nor private employers, shaped union behaviour at different junctures.\nIndeed, most of the case studies are so brief and schematic that Murillo in essence\nasks the reader to accept her summary judgment that her interpretation best fits\nthe circumstances described. In the end, the presentation of stylised facts with\n396 Reviews\nlimited evidentiary value leaves the reader uncomfortably suspended over the\ngap that lies between the insight that can be derived from close analysis of a few\ncarefully developed cases and the statistical confidence that can be achieved by\ntesting falsifiable propositions in larger quantitative studies. In this instance, then,\nthe methodological pursuit of a larger N actually hinders understanding.\nThe second difficulty is that Murillo does not give sufficiently nuanced attention\nto alternative hypotheses (including, for example, the impact of state repression and\nadministrative controls on labour militancy, organisational constraints on labour\u2019s\nmobilisational capacity, and the possibility that major labour organisations in\nArgentina and Mexico responded to market-oriented reforms as they did in part\nbecause these policies were accompanied by effective government measures to\ncontrol inflation). Both the conclusions of the country-specific chapters and chapter\n7 briefly consider (and reject) several alternative explanations, including the likely\nimpact of economic opening on a union based upon its location in either the\ntradable or nontradable goods sectors, the impact of employment conditions upon\nlabour militancy, and the organisational characteristics of unions. However, the case\nstudies too often provide a one-dimensional account of developments in a given\nsector that focuses only upon the presence (or absence) of leadership or union\ncompetition. The author\u2019s presentation is also weakened by frequent stylistic\nproblems, and the book would have benefited from a more detailed index.\nK E V I N J.

Luciak, After the Revolution : Gender and Democracy in El Salvador, Nicaragua,\nand Guatemala (Baltimore, MD: The Johns Hopkins University, 2001),\npp. xi+297, $27.95, pb.\nThe underlying argument presented in this book is succinctly stated in the slogan,\n\u2018Si la mujer no esta\u00b4, la democracia no va \u2019 (Without women, democracy doesn\u2019t\nfunction) (p. 227). This issue is one that ideally would be central to democratisation\nresearch in general. Sadly, this is not the case. And so Ilja Luciak\u2019s book makes all\nthe more important of a contribution to our understanding of transition to and\nconsolidation of democracy in Central America.\nBacked by over 15 years of research experience in Central America, Luciak\u2019s\nanalysis relies most heavily on over 100 interviews, plus a survey of 200 ex-comba-\ntants in El Salvador. As Luciak notes, the depth of analysis is unequal across the\nthree case studies examined. The most thorough data collection was conducted in\nEl Salvador, but he also has impressive fieldwork experience in Nicaragua. The\nGuatemala case involves less fieldwork and data collection and is used mainly to\ngive greater leverage for comparison.\nEarly in the book, Luciak revisits a long-running debate amongst scholars\nregarding the percentage of women in guerrilla movements. Women have been\nestimated to have comprised up to 30 per cent of the fighting force in both the\nFMLN (Farabundo Mart\u0131\u00b4 National Liberation Front) and FSLN (Sandinista National\nLiberation Front). Luciak has tapped into original data from the demobilisation\nprocess with which to examine the issue anew. He finds that women were 29 per\ncent of FMLN combatants and 36.6 per cent of demobilised FLMN political cadres\n(p. 5). Although these findings are consistent with earlier estimates, Luciak points\nReviews 397\nto potential complications with the age distributions. Although roughly 90 per cent\nof all female combatants were between the ages of 14 and 40, a number were over\n60. These women, it seems, were processed as combatants in recognition of their\nyears feeding the guerrillas and tending camp (p. 9). Luciak rightly argues that the\nguerrillas\u2019 understanding of \u2018combatant \u2019 often included men and women in support\nroles, and the common academic distinction made between armed combatants and\nthose in support roles is an artificial one that \u2018 tends to obscure and denigrate the\nimportant role played by women and men who provided logistical support \u2019 (p. 10).\nThere is no comparable data for Nicaragua, but Luciak brings in much new and\nintriguing material on gender relations in the guerrilla forces. In addition to fasci-\nnating anecdotes in this section, Luciak makes the important argument that although\nby 1974 the FSLN had accepted women\u2019s participation as integral to the struggle,\nthat acceptance was based upon a recognition of the useful role that women could\nplay rather than an appreciation for women\u2019s rights (p. 20). Although the data on\ndemobilised guerrillas in Guatemala are not as reliable as in El Salvador, Luciak is\nable to conclude that women comprised a significantly lower percentage of guerrilla\ncombatants than in the other two cases \u2013 roughly 15 per cent (p. 26). The lower level\nof participation in the Guatemalan guerrilla groups is an intriguing finding. A next\nstep for future research will be to explain this difference.\nNext, Luciak turns to a less examined aspect of guerrilla warfare \u2013 the peace\nprocess and reintegration phase. For El Salvador, Luciak aptly demonstrates\nhow women\u2019s issues received little attention in the peace process, even despite the\nparticipation of several high-ranking female commanders (p. 39). His analysis for\nNicaragua focuses on reintegration efforts for the Contras and does not delve\nmuch into the gendered aspects, perhaps due to paucity of information. In the case\nof Guatemala, interestingly, there did seem to be a relatively significant emphasis\non issues of gender in the peace negotiations, yet Luciak is concerned that many of\nthe relevant provisions are unenforceable (p. 57). Here again, his findings provide\na strong foundation from which future research can develop theories as to how to\nsuccessfully include women in peace processes.\nLater chapters deal with women, party politics, and elections in the post-war\nera. He notes that with the wars over, female militants were freer to challenge\ntheir respective parties regarding gender issues. Women in the FMLN and FSLN\nhad clearly played significant roles in their guerrilla movements, allowing them to\nmake strong arguments favouring women\u2019s participation within the post-war party\nstructure (p. 189). Ultimately, the FMLN women were most effective in pursuing\nstrategies that strengthened their formal equality within their party.\nHis final substantive chapter focuses on elections. Here he discusses the suc-\ncesses and shortcomings in women\u2019s efforts to gain greater representation in\nelected office (p. 194). In the 1997 elections FMLN women did well, increasing the\nnumber of women representatives, who then went on to introduce gender equity\nlegislation. Internal disputes decreased their effectiveness in the 2000 elections.\nNicaragua\u2019s women\u2019s movement, by contrast, has remained effective and Luciak\nsees them as growing stronger (p. 224). Drawing lessons from his comparative\nanalysis, Luciak sees the need to broaden the struggle for women\u2019s rights beyond\nthe Left, incorporating it into pluralist alliances to achieve a significant impact\n(p. 225).\nMuch of the book is filled with interesting narrative culled from the hundreds of\nhours of interviews, supplementing the statistics and providing a forum for these\n398 Reviews\nwomen\u2019s own perspectives and analyses. This is a book not to be missed by anyone\nwith an interest in transitions from revolution to democratic consolidation.\nL O R R A I N E B A Y A R D D E VO L OUniversity of Kansas\nJ. Lat. Amer.

The research was based on the\nstudy of a series of communities in provinces of Oropeza, Zudan\u02dcez, Yampara\u00b4ez\n(Chuquisaca) and Chayanta (Potos\u0131\u00b4 ). The major part of the analytical data was de-\nrived from a year-long study of 17 communities during 1995\u201396 collecting data from\neight households in each.\nSuch a collection of essays and reports can serve a useful purpose in informing a\nwide range of readers about something more than just about life in the communities\nin the areas visited. It can present lessons that might be learned from such work in\norder to develop policies for agencies charged with development to collaborate\nmore positively with rural communities for their ultimate benefit. This can best\noccur when the work is set firmly in the context of existing knowledge about\nrural issues in such areas. The present publication makes no such effort. This\nknowledge is freely available in existing books, reports in government and non-\ngovernment agency offices, and academic journals dedicated to diffusing such\ninformation. An introductory chapter by Zoomers does set aspects of the work\nin the context of a part of the relevant social science literature, and Vargas has a\nsound literature review in her discussion of migration. But once the detailed\nresults of field work are presented, no effort is made to discuss the extent to which\nthis knowledge is new or suggests the need to recognise changes in rural livelihood\nstrategies. At no point in the volume is there any review of previous and relevant\nsocial science research in southern Bolivia. Since there is ample evidence that the\nquality of the research reported is high, this is unfortunate.\nThere is well-grounded and detailed criticism of the way in which most NGOs\nand GOs (non-government and government organisations) conduct their rural de-\nvelopment actions. What is needed to make these criticisms more trenchant is to\nidentify the reasons for misguided, low-impact or unsustainable actions on the part\nof so many local, regional, national and international agencies. There is some men-\ntion here of the limited benefits accruing to households and individuals with fewest\nresources, but the various chapters do not analyse the reasons for such deficiencies.\nThe pressures, to which all agencies are subject, to apply policies that are not\nnecessarily relevant for regions or communities are not discussed in any detail. The\nlimited life of most actions that make sustainability difficult to ensure and the limited\nsensitivity to the perceptions of rural people themselves \u2013 well analysed by Vargas\nand alluded to in Boer\u2019s presentation of the volume \u2013 also need more detailed\nexamination in order for necessary policy changes to be made clear.\nA third component of such thorough and relatively sensitive field work and group\nreflection that is only scantily incorporated in this volume is the answer to the\nReviews 399\nquestion \u2013 where now? How should agencies listen more attentively to rural people,\nand especially the poor? What are the best ways of judging whether actions have\nbeen developed in a truly participatory way? Do community views and priorities\nadequately represent the views of those with least resources? Given the need for\nlocal professionals to seek employment with NGOs and the few surviving govern-\nment agencies carrying out field work following the abandonment of local and\nregional state rural development provision, can the old practitioners be trained in\nthe more participative ways of working with communities that are now fashionable?\nHow should the younger professionals be taught to work alongside communities,\nhelping them to satisfy their needs rather than some high-level notion of post-\nharvest security or a national wheat programme?\nAlthough the book does not carry the research towards a logical conclusion with\nrespect to its stated aim of contributing \u2018 to the implementation of appropriate\npolicies for rural development \u2019 (p. 3), it does offer a wealth of information about a\nrange of aspects of community issues with relation to attempts to promote positive\nsocial and economic change. Migration is recognised as being a major factor in\nhousehold livelihoods but the different impacts of migration to the Bolivian low-\nlands and to Argentina are not examined. Similarly, the issues surrounding the\ncontamination of some of the river systems by mining are only mentioned in\npassing. The importance of the formation of nucleated settlements following the\n1953 agrarian reform is well explored although without reference to previous re-\nsearch on this in the northern Altiplano. In the concluding essays, that by Le Grande\nreviews strategic errors in development work with communities, gives little attention\nto the lack of impact on those with least resources but makes a strong and well-\nargued case for the development of accountability as a key notion that should be\nused in the design of future programmes.\nThere is, nevertheless, a great deal of value in this volume. It is based on a series\nof sound field studies and useful information about communities in parts of\nChuquisaca and Potos\u0131\u00b4 is presented. It could have formed the basis for a serious\nconsideration of not only why much development action has been of limited impact\nbut also how future work with needy communities and people can be more cost-\neffective and have more long-lasting results.\nD A V I D P R E S T O NUniversity of Leeds\nJ.

It claims to : (1) provide an ethnographic\ndescription of peoples \u2018who are situated on the periphery of the global economy\u2019\n(p. 180) ; (2) develop a methodological approach to describe such societies ; and (3)\nassess whether any programme of social and economic development can lead to\nthe reduction of poverty while respecting and strengthening the peoples\u2019 sense of\nidentity.\nRenshaw\u2019s book has emerged from his PhD thesis presented in 1986, the research\nfor which was undertaken from 1975 to 1983. The introduction contains a vivid\ndescription of the vicissitudes of anthropological research within the peculiar\n400 Reviews\npolitical economy of Paraguay. The author comments on his sense of personal\nfailure at never having spent a long period of time in any one community nor having\nmastered any of the Chaco languages, and this has influenced his research approach.\nHe takes the thirteen ethnic groups comprising the forty-five thousand Chaco Indians\nas a single population that, although not homogeneous, experience shared cultural\nfeatures, and a shared geographical and politico-administrative context \u2013 the Para-\nguayan Chaco. The assertion is reasonably persuasive, but axiomatic also. The variety\nof situations of the Chaco peoples suggests that analysis of the differences between\ncommunities would be equally or even more enlightening. On method, Renshaw\nstates that the account is essentially \u2018 impressionistic \u2019 (p. 13). This is supported by a\nquantitative background derived from the 1981 Indian census. These data are pres-\nented alongside others from the 1992 national census, and projections for 1998\nbased on an estimated 3.1 per cent annual increase since 1981.\nThe first chapter describes the natural and human environment of the Paraguayan\nChaco. The other six principal chapters discuss the economy of the Chaco Indians\nand the rural production systems, the peoples\u2019 economic concepts, and the social\nand political organisation of the peoples at household and community levels. The\nsubsistence or foraging economy is described with a precise and experienced insight.\nThe importance of wage labour is emphasised, and the cultural significance of labour\nmarket practices \u2013 of both employee and employer \u2013 has the same high quality\nempirical observations. The concepts of equality and sharing are shown to explain\nmany of the phenomena of the Indian economy, but seem also to contradict the\nemphasis on what Renshaw describes as the Indians\u2019 conception of \u2018personal auton-\nomy\u2019 and \u2018a refusal to accept any form of coercion as legitimate \u2019 (p. 247). There is\nan unresolved tension between \u2018personal autonomy\u2019 and the evidence of reciprocal\neconomic, social and political obligations. The significance for the traditional\neconomy of the loss of the land is probably understated, as is the loss of territory\nin defining the hunter-gathers\u2019 social identity. The phenomenon of land as a\npsychological \u2018 space \u2019 is not considered. A final word reiterates an earlier point that\nsustainable development is most likely to occur through local capacity building.\nThe impressionistic nature of the work is, perhaps, not a rigorous analytical\napproach. Too often the author writes that he believes that a given phenomenon\nis illustrative or typical of the Chaco Indians. There are questions about facts and\ninterpretation, and an undue reliance on the census of 1981, which was a good guess\nat the time_ Of more significance is that in the preface Renshaw states that some\nof the material has been updated since the completion of the PhD. Unfortunately,\nsome \u2013 or much of it \u2013 has not. And it is difficult and frustrating to interpret\nstatements that are temporal : by the use of the present tense does he mean the\ntime of the research (1975\u201383), or when the thesis was submitted (1986), or the time\nof his last visit to Paraguay (1995) \u2013 or the year of publication (2002)? Criticisms of\nthe indigenist organisations, both secular and Christian, are at least partly true.\nBut for all their weaknesses, they recognised the significance of restoring land to\nthe Indian communities, not only or even primarily for economic reasons, but for\nthe sake of identity. And the support programmes have moved from economic\nprescriptions towards capacity building.\nOf the book\u2019s objectives, the descriptive account, though time-bound, is a valu-\nable record of the lives of the Chaco Indians.

Some might argue that the theme has by now become a little dated, but the\nfact remains that serious work on individual countries within the broader debate\nabout globalisation is still thin on the ground, particularly on Latin American\ncountries, and to this extent solid comparative studies are to be welcomed. The\nproblem in the present case appears to be that the book does not in fact address the\nquestions it sets for itself, limiting its purview instead to a descriptive and narrative\naccount of what has happened in Argentina, Brazil and Chile over the post-war\nperiod. It seemed difficult to know what exactly the book was about : it dotted\nbetween all sorts of concepts and issues, and although the reader knows that the\n\u2018peg \u2019 is intended to be \u2018globalisation \u2019, it remains rather difficult to see where the\nnotion of globalisation directly informs the analysis of the three countries which\ncomprises the bulk of the book. One is perplexed, for instance, to come across quite\ndetailed comments on Carlos Menem\u2019s divorce, and on the scandal of two govern-\nment officials\u2019 extra-marital affairs in Brazil, and this gives an impression that the\nbook offers a chronological account of events rather than an analysis of globalisation\nand responses to it in the Southern Cone of Latin America. The reader is also struck\nby curious discrepancies in the scope of the analysis : the Real Plan, for example,\nreceived only one paragraph\u2019s worth of discussion when this would be of key con-\ncern in a study of responses to globalising trends in the world economy, and one\nwould be hard pressed to make a clear case that ISI (which dominates a third of the\nbook and is brought up again in the conclusion) is directly germane to the question\nof responses to globalisation in a manner which would warrant such a detailed\ncommentary.\nPerhaps the more pressing problem in this respect is that there is little or no\nexplicit or sustained discussion in the book of the questions that must be central to\nthe \u2018core \u2019 of the book\u2019s concerns as they are outlined in the introduction: namely,\nthe questions of why certain strategies were adopted in the three countries under\nconsideration, and moreover why, given what is here presented to be an encom-\npassing structural process, these strategies should be so contingent and diverse.\nOne struggles to see, in this sense, what the core significance of the book is, given\nthat it seems to offer frustratingly little reflection on globalisation itself, the way\n1 The PRODECHACO project of \u2018sustainable development founded on the active partici-\npation of the Indian population\u2019 that was launched in 1995. http:\/\/www.prodechaco.\norg.py\/\n402 Reviews\nwe approach its study, or the contours of the contemporary political economies of\nArgentina, Brazil and Chile.

This\nChica was created \u2013 a kind of collage of personalities pasted together over a century\nand a half beginning with an attorney-cum-amateur-historian in the 1850s, an 1890s\nbishop, followed by tourism promoters, novelists, playwright, film maker, and most\nrecently a telenovela producer. These Chicas, distorted, exaggerated, romanticised,\nsometimes pure fantasy or in extreme bad taste, led historian Ju\u00b4nia Ferreria Furtado\nto ask : who was Chica da Silva? Furtado wants to find the woman who lived on the\n\u2018other side of the myth\u2019.\nShe searched for Chica in all the piles of musty, faded old paper in which good\nsocial and cultural historians know to look : parish records listing births, marriages,\ndeaths ; sales and purchases of houses, land, slaves meticulously registered by\nnotaries in their big books ; wills and inventories ; a 1774 house-by-house census\nand the tax rolls for Tejuco, now Diamantina, where Chica lived most of her\nfree life ; a ledger at the recolhimento Macau\u00b4bas of the gifts and visits Chica made\nto her daughters who studied there. She swept through archives small and large,\nlocal and national, not only in Brazil, but also in Portugal.\nBecause, of course, it was not enough to pursue only Chica. Furtado had to find\nthose who played important roles in Chica\u2019s life, especially Joa\u02dco Fernandes de\nOliveira, the diamond contractor, her companion, her quasi-husband. And like that\nof other important white men Joa\u02dco Fernandes\u2019 paper trail is easier to follow and leads\nto the provincial governor and even higher to the powerful friend of the king, Jose\u00b4\nde Carvalho e Melo, Marquis of Pombal, who doled out colonial authority to those\nhe trusted \u2013 and he trusted Joa\u02dco Fernandes just as he trusted his father. If Furtado\nis treated to a full accounting of Joa\u02dco Fernandes\u2019 vast and diverse property through\nhis post-mortem inventory, she must swallow the bitter disappointment that Chica\u2019s\ninventory, once carefully transcribed and notarised, is now missing from the archive\nwhere it should reside. The setback barely slows her. She painstakingly pieces\ntogether Chica\u2019s ownership, for example, of at least 104 slaves over the course of\nher lifetime from fragmented sources scattered throughout northern Minas.\nReviews 403\nThe Chica she finds is not the fictional exotic mulata, but a woman more down-\nto-earth, convincing, and typical of other former slave women of this time and\nplace than we expect. But from the intersection between biography and history, she\nalso wants to retrieve what was uniquely Chica. Born to an African slave mother\nand a white father a few years after the discovery of diamonds \u2013 sometime between\n1731 and 1735, the date remains uncertain \u2013 by 1749 Chica had been bought by\nManuel Pires Sardinha, probably as his concubine, and two years later gave birth\nto their child. Accused by a Pastoral Visit of illicit relations with his two slave\nwomen, Sardinha sold her (and their child Sima\u02dco) in January 1753 to Joa\u02dco Fernandes\nde Oliviera, probably to be his concubine. In December of the same year (here\nFurtado slips in a delicious bit of historical reconstruction to explain the signifi-\ncance of the date), Joa\u02dco Fernandes freed her. Unusually, it was not remarkable\nfor eighteenth-century slave women to be either concubines or freed, but typically\nthey waited for their freedom, often seeing their children freed at baptism, until\ntheir owners grew old and, fearing death, released them. Not so Chica and Joa\u02dco\nFernandes who stayed together eighteen years, and raised their own thirteen children\nas well as Sima\u02dco, living respectably as property owners and generous Catholics.\nAll the children were baptised and recognised as their father\u2019s heirs ; all were edu-\ncated \u2013 the girls at the most prestigious convent then available in Minas, the boys\nin Portugal. If this is not the typical life-story of an ex-slave, neither is it the story\nof a lascivious woman said to devour men. After all, as Furtado suggests, thirteen\nchildren born in sixteen years is enough to dull any woman\u2019s lustre.\nIf others invented the mythical Chica, Chica invented herself. Stephen Greenblatt,\nreferring to sixteenth-century English society, called the process \u2018 self-fashioning \u2019,1\nthe shaping of personal identity that involves not only aspiration and a vision of\nwho one might become, but possession of personal resources \u2013 ambition, talent,\nbeauty \u2013 combined with the possibility of social mobility and, at the same time,\na sensible recognition of the boundaries that constrain individual initiative.\nThroughout, Furtado\u2019s theme is Chica\u2019s effort to insert herself into free, white\nsociety, observing its rules for wife, mother, dona da casa, patron of church and\nsodalities \u2013to imitate the senhora she wanted to be. Chica became Francisca da Silva\nde Oliveira, a return both to her baptismal name and the addition of Joa\u02dco Fernandes\u2019\nsurname as her own. It was common practice among freed slaves to take their\nformer master\u2019s name as their own, but here the borrowing becomes ambiguous,\nmore a wife assuming her married name. Allied with a man whose wealth and\nprestige she informally shared, she gained a social position she could never have\nachieved alone.\nDespite the glory and promise \u2013 Chica\u2019s house in town and their estate with its\nlavish gardens where they staged theatre and music, the fazendas, horses and cattle,\nthe sponsoring of chapels \u2013 despite all that, in the end things did not turn out quite\nas they wished. Furtado\u2019s exhaustive research extends not only to the children, but\nto the grandchildren as well and, while some made good marriages, others ended\nup with failed marriages or no marriage at all, natural children, or wealth dispersed.\nBut most arresting is Joa\u02dco Fernandes\u2019 hurried departure from Chica provoked by\nnews of his father\u2019s death in Lisboa in 1770 and his stepmother\u2019s grab for half the\nestate rather than contenting herself with the dowry she had agreed to. Whether\n1 Stephen Greenblatt, Renaissance Self-Fashioning : From More to Shakespeare (Chicago, 1980),\npp. 1\u20139.\n404 Reviews\nChica and Joa\u02dco Fernandes understood they would never meet again is not known.\nFurtado mentions no letters, no messages between them, but surely they corre-\nsponded about the children and property if nothing else? Joa\u02dco Fernandes spent the\nnext years in Lisbon embroiled in legal battles to save his fortune. The sons followed\nhim to Europe to complete their educations, while Chica remained in Tejuco in\ncharge of their nine daughters. By 1775 Joa\u02dco Fernandes was himself ill and dying\nand, with the king\u2019s death in 1777 and Pombal out of favour at court, his fortunes\nwent from bad to worse. He died without returning to Brazil or to Chica. Until her\nown death almost twenty years later, Chica remained a wealthy woman with land and\nslaves of her own. Her burial inside the church near the main altar and the many\nmasses offered for her soul confirmed her earthly prominence.\nAs both prologue and epilogue to Chica\u2019s history, Furtado pauses to reflect on the\nwriting of the story and, by extension, on doing history. Her position is clear in\nthis post post-modern era : history is not fiction; it is not invention. Unlike the myth-\nmakers, historians may not fill in the gaps. Rather, historians are bound to a rigorous\nexamination of all retrievable evidence located within its equally rigorously con-\nstructed context. For E. P. Thompson, \u2018 the discipline of history is, above all, the\ndiscipline of context \u2019.2 Contextual reconstruction and interpretation is also Furtado\u2019s\nmethod, so that in the end she succeeds not only in illuminating Chica da Silva, but\nalso life in the mining districts of eighteenth-century Minas Gerais. She cautions\nthat historical reconstruction has its boundaries. There is much about motive\nand emotion that remains frustratingly elusive, the sources stubbornly silent, and\nFurtado refrains from speculating. Nonetheless, this wonderfully researched\nand written book triumphs in reminding us that history is more compelling than\nfiction.

After two\ndecades of mixed experiences with democratic governance throughout the region,\nwe can feel heartened by the example of Porto Alegre where even the poor exercise\nactive voice in local government.\nIn this impressively researched, theoretically sophisticated and cogently written\naccount Abers examines the \u2018participatory budget \u2019 process initiated by the Partido\ndos Trabalhadores (PT) government that came to power in Porto Alegre in 1989.\nLike PT governments elected in other Brazilian cities, the municipal authorities in\nPorto Alegre saw the participatory budget as a means of wresting control over\nrevenues from traditional elites and targeting greater spending toward the poor.\nBy mobilizing poor and working-class neighbourhoods to set their own budget\n2 E. P.

Abers explains why, despite\nsome failures, the PT in Porto Alegre succeeded in eliminating clientelism and\nimplementing policies that genuinely served those most in need.\nAbers draws from the rich literature on participation and the politics of social\nmovements to explain how PT governments overcame three common problems\nthat usually defeat attempts to empower the disadvantaged. The implementation of\nparticipatory policies is often stymied by the limits of time and money, bureaucratic\ninfighting and external pressures from powerful elite groups. Participatory forums\nalso reveal sources of political and economic inequality that undermine efforts\nto grant the unorganised poor genuine decision-making power. Existing elites or\nnewly privileged groups thus gain control and exclude the less powerful. Finally,\nmore often than not, governing elites use participatory programmes to co-opt\nand demobilise civic leaders who might challenge their control.\nIn a careful analysis based on extensive interviews, participant observation, survey\nresearch and case studies, Abers shows how government actors successfully mobil-\nised and empowered Porto Alegre\u2019s most disadvantaged citizens in the choice of\ninvestment projects throughout the city. Instead of focusing on improvements in\nwell-to-do neighbourhoods or enriching powerful construction firms, the govern-\nment carried out capital projects in working-class and poorer areas of the city. Even\nmore remarkably, funding for these projects reflected priorities set by budgetary\ncouncils attended by thousands of ordinary citizens.\nThe success of participatory politics in Porto Alegre turns several prevailing views\nof social mobilisation and state action on their heads. Abers credits the actions of\nPT officials in the municipal government with actively mobilising many citizens\nwho had no prior experience with politics or policymaking. Such a \u2018 top down\u2019\nprocess challenges the widely held view that genuine participation requires mobil-\nisation from below. Contrary to expectations and much prior experience, the PT\nin Porto Alegre did not use the participatory budget to co-opt the working poor.\nIndeed, as Abers skilfully argues, once they recognised the authenticity of the\nparticipatory budget, the citizens of the city readily assumed ownership of it. She\nprovides substantial evidence countering those who see participatory politics as an\nopportunity for the resurgence (or continuation) of elite control through clientelism.\nThe successful inclusion of the working poor and the elimination of longstanding\nelite control in Porto Alegre confirm that grassroots democracy can thrive in Brazil\nand should not be abandoned as a goal of progressive politics.\nNo doubt some will find this account implausibly optimistic and perhaps overly\nsympathetic to the local PT government. While Abers\u2019 sympathies clearly lie with\ngrassroots democracy, she grounds her analysis in sound social scientific methods\nand empirical observation. She does not portray the PT leaders as altruists but\nas rational actors interested in their own political survival. Their commitment to\nparticipatory budgeting remained high because it led to their electoral success.\nThe only disappointment in this otherwise highly satisfying book is the author\u2019s\nfailure to explain why the participatory budget succeeded in Porto Alegre and not in\nother local governments under PT control. The answer does not appear to lie in\nthe city\u2019s past history that closely resembled the traditional form of rule seen else-\nwhere in Brazil. Nor can it be found in the ideological or political differences within\nthe PT. Abers\u2019 analysis does suggest that individual leaders made the critical differ-\nence though structural factors might also have played a role. A more systematic\n406 Reviews\nresponse to this puzzling question would have further enhanced the book\u2019s contri-\nbution to the literature.\nRich in detail and nuance, Abers\u2019 book will renew a sense of optimism among\nmany who have become discouraged with the failure of democracy to fulfil its\npromise in Latin America. Though restricted to a single aspect of municipal\ngovernance, the success of participatory budgeting in Porto Alegre shows that\npromise is still alive.\nE L I Z A W I L L I SGrinnel College\nJ.

It is note-\nworthy, amongst many reasons, for its fluency in the idioms of ecology and social\nscience as well as more recondite post-structuralism. It is a combination provides\na unique flavour as well as drawing upon a range of literature not typical of an\nAmazonian studies. Specialists and general readers will appreciate the scope.\nThe sub-title \u2018a natural history \u2019 refers in part to a persistent dilemma in social\nscientific writing about Amazonia and Amazonians, namely the overwhelming\nnaturalism associated with the region and its peoples, overwhelming to the degree\nthat the notion of culture in Amazonia \u2013 much less agency \u2013 has long and widely\nbeen regarded as a second order phenomenon, with native peoples trapped in the\nawkward vessels of \u2018noble savage \u2019, nomad, primitive, etc. When it comes to studies\nof non-native Amazonians, nature\u2019s power is even greater : lacking the authenticity\nof native peoples\u2019 original condition in harmony \u2013 or so one would be led to\nbelieve \u2013 with nature, the ersatz peasant legatees are depicted as disarticulated,\npredatory foragers and scroungers. From diverse quarters, however, attention has\nshifted to an anthropogenic Amazonia, one in which features of the apparently\nnatural landscape are shown to be the result of cultural manipulation of environ-\nments as through cultigens (Lathrap), sedentary social forms (Roosevelt), trans-\nformed extractive bases (Bale\u00b4e), complex tribal networks (Heckenberg) and, in\nRaffles\u2019 case, modification of fluvial networks at the hands of contemporary non-\nIndian Amazonians. The main discussion presented by Raffles concerns a com-\nmunity in Amapa\u00b4 (where he did fieldwork) whose members have, over past decades,\ncreated waterways to enhance those naturally available in order to advance their\ninterests as petty, interior smallholders and traders. This kind of anthropogenicism\nlends further weight to a case voiced by an increasing number of Amazonian\nscholars to the effect that the portrayals (scientific and literary) of the region which\nhave prevailed since conquest, but in heavily codified form since the collecting\nvoyages of nineteenth- century British naturalists, require an extensive reassessment.\nRaffles\u2019 measured tone mitigates much sense of polemic, but the work has serious\nimplications not only in reminding Amazonianists about what has been so easily\n(and understandably) overlooked in responding to the extreme transformative ef-\nfects of a virtually unregulated assault on biological and social systems in Amazonia,\nbut also in terms of providing an account grounded in the lives of actual Amazo-\nnians as opposed to the cipher-like characters who populate the pages of official\nReviews 407\ndevelopment reports. The canal-builders of Amapa\u00b4 have antecedents not only in\nsuch constructions as the canal system near Igarape\u00b4-Miri, southwest of Bele\u00b4m, but\nalso the tidally-driven sugar mills and distilleries of the estuary that supplied rum for\nupriver trade until driven out of business by cheap alternatives borne on the new\nhighways (in the 1960s\u201370s).\nThese ethnographic aspects of the work, however, make up a surprisingly small\nportion of the text (essentially chapters 3 and 7). Chapter 1 is a sketch of the early\nambitions he had for the book. Chapter 2 provides an overview of the Lower\nAmazon floodplain with special attention to the cultural ecological arguments that\nhave dominated anthropological discourse in the region since the time of Steward.\nChapter 4 \u2013 \u2018A countrey never sackt \u2019, while consistent with the overall themes of\nhaphazard, piecemeal and frustrated venture during the colonial period and the\npersistence of images of the unconquered tropical frontier, seems slightly out of\nplace. It is concerned with Ralegh\u2019s unsuccessful plea for the plausibility of a tropical\nNew World Empire and suggests an historic sweep not evident in other parts of\nthe book. A chapter (5) devoted to Bates and Victorian Amazonia, one (6) on the\nlabyrinths (and delusions?) of applied ecology, and a return to Igarape\u00b4 Guariba (7)\ncomplete the volume.

This new volume stressing the socio-cultural dimension of the\nsubject is a valuable addition to a literature, which spread outwards from the larger\nrepublics to the smaller during the 1990s. Diego Armus opens the book with a useful\nintroduction that summarises the state of the historiography.

Strangely Brazil is omitted from the book,\nbut \u2013 desirably \u2013 Haiti is included.

This essay contains a spirited discussion of how an enlightened\nexperiment in mental health deteriorated, owing principally to lack of funding and\nsustained leadership, political dislocations and inadequacies of personnel, into little\nmore than an oppressive penal colony. The second is a lively analysis by David\nParker of hygiene and housing in the city of Lima during the period 1890\u20131920.\nParker explains persuasively the consequences of contradictions between elite\nideologies that urged enlightened hygiene and housing reform from above and those\nthat began from assumptions that the poor were congenitally incapable of both\n408 Reviews\nself-improvement and improvement from outside. Equally penetrating is an essay\nby David Sowell on Miguel Perdomo Neira, a politically astute Colombian curandero\nof the mid-nineteenth century, whose clients mobilised against the exponents of\n\u2018official medicine \u2019 to the point where crowds in Bogota\u00b4 stoned the houses of pro-\nfessional physicians, only to be confronted by medical students shouting the slogan\n\u2018Abajo los perdomistas, los fana\u00b4ticos \u2019. In another eloquent chapter, the editor re-\nflects upon the changing place of poor women as the Buenos Aires evolved between\n1900 and 1940 from a small, intimate city into a large, anonymous metropolis. Using\nnovels, tangos and early cinema as evidence, Armus draws out connections between\ntuberculosis and its victims among seamstresses and milonguitas.\nThe emphasis of this new work upon the socio-cultural raises questions about the\ndirection being taken by the historiography of popular medicine. Historians have\nstill to delineate the contours of Luso-Hispanic, black and indigenous medicine in\nLatin America during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and to establish the\nconnections between them and an evolving \u2018official medicine \u2019. Various themes of\n\u2018political economy\u2019 require further attention. How did the relationship between the\nstate, local government and popular healers evolve? How far was draconian legis-\nlation against popular practitioners enforced, especially in areas, where, for lack of\nprofessional resources, the populace had no alternative to resorting to \u2018empirical \u2019\npractitioners? How far did professional pharmacists and veterinary specialists, as\nwell as medical students, substitute for trained physicians when these were scarce\nor absent? How intense was competition between different categories of health\n\u2018provider \u2019 for limited markets?\nThe past two decades have seen new anxieties regarding the quality of medical\neducation, an area where considerable progress had been made between the 1920s\nand 1970s. In some countries the orthodoxies of de-regulation have meant a barely\ncontrolled proliferation of private faculties of medicine, some of them pioneering\nand innovative ; but others of poor quality have lacked in full-time professors,\nhospitals for clinical teaching, laboratories and libraries. Health ministries and pro-\nfessional leaders have yet to face the question of whether the products of low-quality\nfaculties are better trained than the members of families of popular healers that\ntransmit accumulated knowledge across generations. This set of essays makes a\nwelcome contribution to the literature.

The first describes the reform process from initiation to\nimplementation while the second explores the initial effects these new institutions\nhave had on post-reform behaviour especially by political parties during elections.\nGrindle also considers how these changes might have enhanced democratic ac-\ncountability and responsiveness by recasting traditional conflicts and permitting the\nintroduction of new political voices. To provide context for these changes and to\ndemonstrate their audacious nature, Grindle also provides brief, yet ample, accounts\nof historic conflicts that have shaped politics in the three countries.\nGrindle finds that reform followed a similar process in the three countries.\nDespite their potential for introducing profound changes in the political system, the\nreforms did not emerge from public debate nor did they generate much controversy\nin the wider polity. In addition, specific institutional innovations were the products\nof design teams of experts appointed by the president. Finally, though the new rules\nof the game came through a top-down process, their introduction stimulated\nbroader participation as groups and individuals competed for power in a changed\ninstitutional environment. For example, political parties in Venezuela and Bolivia\nthat had focused exclusively on national issues and elections now had to reorient\ntheir strategies toward the local level.\nGrindle\u2019s strong claim that these reforms originated in the executive branch\nand reflected the agendas of specific presidents contradicts those approaches that\nsee reform as a product of the interests of political parties working through national\nlegislatures. The author\u2019s access to original documents and to central figures in the\nreform allows her to make a convincing argument for her more executive-driven\nview. At the same time, these sources may have led her to downplay the role legis-\nlative and party politics played in mobilising bias or shaping the final legislation.\nIt seems unlikely that political party leaders would remain complacent in the face\nof changes that would limit or completely eliminate their control over key sources of\npatronage. For example, while it is true that legislators in Venezuela passed reforms\n410 Reviews\nallowing for the direct and open election of mayors and governors, they maintained\ntight control over fiscal revenues thereby weakening the impact of decentralisation.\nThe author\u2019s obvious optimism about the potential these reforms have for en-\nhancing democratic accountability and curtailing longstanding clientelist politics\nis cheering though perhaps not fully warranted. As Grindle herself acknowledges, in\nVenezuela the reforms failed to thrive after Hugo Cha\u00b4vez took power. Though they\nappear to have taken hold more firmly in Bolivia, continuing political instability and\nhigh levels of corruption permit only cautious optimism about the reform\u2019s future.\nThese outcomes also raise doubts about the virtues of introducing reforms from the\ntop down. Audacious Reforms makes a major contribution to the growing literature\non political decentralisation and institutional reform in Latin America. Grindle\u2019s\nperceptive observations, excellent case studies, and sophisticated analysis have\nmoved current debates forward.\nE L I Z A W I L L I SGrinnel College\nJ. Lat. Amer. Stud. 36 (2004).

The Quiet Revolution in Latin America has two components :\nthe trends towards decentralisation and local democracy. Although the process\n\u2018emerged only in the past decade or so\u2019 (p. 3), Tim Campbell asserts that it has\nbrought major changes in urban governance. \u2018Swiftly and radically, yet remarkably\npeacefully, these two trends of decentralization and democratisation transformed\nthe entire face of governance in the region\u2019 (p. 4). The book explains why the\nrevolution came about, the forces that have held it back and what is needed both to\naccelerate and consolidate it.\nWhat confused me in the book is what, precisely, has the revolution has\nachieved? Admittedly, we get some impression of what leading cities do that the\nlaggards do not : post-revolution mayors consult the poor more frequently, de-\nvelop more environmental and poverty programmes and are more successful in\nraising both capital and taxes. Most importantly the newly democratic leadership\nhas introduced \u2018a flowering of innovative practices \u2019, such as participatory\nbudgeting, the election of police inspectors and the initiation of neighbourhood\nimprovement funds. But, if these are the substance of the revolution, what are\nthe achievements in terms of improving people\u2019s lives? We are told that elected\nmayors in Asuncio\u00b4n, Mexico City and scores of other cities (pp. 115\u201316) have\nconsulted the citizenry and discovered that violence and crime are major problems.\nBut has this resulted in programmes that have systematically reduced crime and\nviolence? Has service provision improved in the leading cities as a result of regular\nconsultation with the public and what do voters think about issues like pri-\nvatisation? On this point, the author rather disarmingly admits that his \u2018optimistic\ntone_ should not be misinterpreted as a statement of policy success \u2019 (p. 10).\nAnd, since he is at pains to point out that the number of people living in urban\npoverty increased from 80 million in 1975 to 125 million in 1995, it might be\ndifficult to do so.\nReviews 411\nSome questions also have to be asked of the methodology that underpins this\nbook. Discussion of the methodology is thin although the author admits that it\nis \u2018 less than scientific \u2019, based on \u2018hundreds of interviews \u2019 conducted over a nine-\nyear period, but reliant on \u2018 little systematic data gathering \u2019 (p. 11). I am sure many of\nthese interviews were fascinating but it is a pity that we are so rarely provided with\nquotes or any detailed comment about those meetings. Without more information\nabout who was actually interviewed and the degree of objectivity of the respondents\u2019\naccounts, it is difficult to know how much can be believed.\nTim Campbell also admits that most of the evidence is drawn from the so-called\n\u2018 leading \u2019 cities of the region, those that have progressed furthest with the reforms.\nThis suggests that there may be a problem of \u2018chicken and egg\u2019. Could the leading\ncities have been the better-managed cities before the revolution? The lack of much\ndiscussion of the failures does not help answer that problem. I also find it a little odd\nthat the leading cities are never really identified. Of course, the entries in the index\ngive some indication, since Bogota\u00b4, Cali (Colombia), Caracas, Cuiaba (Brazil), La\nPaz, Mexico City and, above all, Porto Alegre and Tijuana have the most pages\ndevoted, they presumably are among the leading cities. But are cities like Curitiba,\nGuadalajara and Medell\u0131\u00b4n, which hardly rate a mention, not also leading cities ? At\na national level, the leading countries are clearly named. They include \u2018 the pioneers \u2019,\nChile and Mexico, and the \u2018second wave \u2019, Colombia, Brazil and Venezuela.\nOne danger with a book based on the gathering of successful examples is, as\nTim Campbell admits, that it is bound to veer towards the optimistic. All too often,\nnothing is said about the failures. For example, if decentralisation and democrati-\nsation in Colombia have generally improved the quality of government, why was the\n\u2018worse crisis of corruption in recent years \u2019 revealed in Cartagena in February 2000\n(Semana 26 February 2000)? If the city of Cali is such a success and Rodrigo Guerrero,\nthe second elected mayor of Cali, Colombia, deserving of such high praise highly\nfor his hard work and professionalism, how is it possible that a seemingly very\ngood successor, Mauricio Guzma\u00b4n, was jailed during his term of office for links\nwith the Cali drug cartel. Does the quiet revolution ebb and flow even within cities,\nlet alone countries?\nThe book is also rather let down by a number of small factual errors and some\nfunny Spanish spelling. Certainly the author\u2019s geography of Venezuela is question-\nable for it is reported that Irene Sa\u00b4ez, the former Miss Universe, became mayor of\nthe non-existent Caracas municipality of La Chacra, and the city of Tumero has\nseemingly moved from 100 kilometres west of Caracas to the southeast. Such errors\nare irritating, but they also raise doubts about the quality of the information on\nwhich the argument is based.\nHowever, there is still much of value in this book. If it does not probe the success\nstories rigorously enough, and never discusses the failures, it has identified a number\nof interesting cases where improvement has taken place. The author\u2019s enthusiasm\nfor the \u2018participation of voice \u2019 is also commendable, even if we need to know under\nwhat circumstances those who ask actually gain any real benefit. For me, this is the\nmain unanswered question: how precisely does the quiet revolution improve\nthe lives of ordinary people in Latin America? For example, is the undoubted im-\nprovement in urban governance in Bogota\u00b4 over the past fifteen years linked directly\nto increasing democratisation and decentralisation and if it is why has it allowed\nliving conditions to deteriorate over the last five years? I have little doubt that\nelection of the mayor has been a significant contributor to better governance, but\n412 Reviews\nbecause a severe economic recession hit the city in 1997, many people\u2019s lives have\ndeteriorated badly over the last five years. The Quiet Revolution may be welcome\nbut many other factors determine the quality of life.\nThis fundamental question of the link between better governance and poverty\nalleviation demands more detailed exemplification in future work. Future studies of\nCuritiba, Guadalajara and Medell\u0131\u00b4n would also be helpful in the sense of under-\nstanding why they are among the best-run cities in Latin America. Does their success\nstem mainly from the Quiet Revolution or did the changes that have permitted their\nsuccess not precede the revolution by some years? To some extent, chapter eight\nbegins to answer those questions. Here some of the barriers to successful urban\ngovernance are revealed and a sound argument put forward as to why central\ngovernments and the international development banks ought to do more to help\nthe fledgling local democracies. At the same time, the long list of recommendations\nmakes one ask whether a great deal in Latin America has actually changed since the\nlate 1980s. And, if \u2018 the bulk of the 14,000 units of local government in the region \u2019\nhave not been affected and \u2018some local governments have reverted to old traditions\nof clientelistic relations \u2019 (p. 145), has there really been a revolution at all ?\nA L A N G I L B E R TUniversity College London\nJ.

DOI: 10.1017\/S0022216X04427722\nJacquelyn Chase (ed.), The Spaces of Neoliberalism : Land, Place and Family in Latin\nAmerica (Bloomfield, CT: Kumarian Press, Inc., 2002), pp. ix+250, \u00a354.50,\n\u00a321.50 pb.\nThis edited collection by a geographer sets itself a very ambitious task in trying to\nrelate recent shifts in political economy to space, place and family in Latin America.\nSuch an endeavour needs not only to develop the geographers\u2019 interest in scale but\nalso make meaningful interpretations about how analysis at different scales can be\nlinked ; for example, how operations in the global economy can impact on places\nand families at the local level in Latin America. Escobar (p. viii) picks up on the\ndistinctiveness of this fusion of geography, anthropology and political economy in\nbeing able to unravel the impacts of globalisation.\nChase has brought together some very interesting chapters by leading academics\nin the field. Some of these chapters have appeared in similar forms elsewhere and so\nthe book is somewhat a cross between a reader (of texts already published) and the\nreporting of new work. After a brief introduction of the geographies of neoliberalism\nin Latin America by Chase, the book is divided into three sets of themes : agrarian\nand territorial rights ; the impact of privatisation and globalisation on individual\nlivelihoods ; examining those on the margins of neoliberalism.\nThe most significant emphasis in the book is on agrarian change. Kay\u2019s chapter\ntraces the causes and objectives of agrarian reform before focusing on its economic\nand social impacts. The chapter shows that territorial reforms have not only pro-\nvided examples of progressive redistribution of some categories of land but also\nopened the way for increasingly \u2018globalised \u2019 social movements with the objective\nof establishing the right to territory. This links clearly with the chapter by Deere\nand Leon on individual and collective land rights and gender. The prominence of\nneoliberalism has coincided with the rise of women\u2019s and indigenous people\u2019s\nmovements in Latin America, and with the globalisation of both of these move-\nments. These movements can be in conflict and the central concern of the authors\nReviews 413\nis \u2018when respect for customary law or traditional customs and practices violates the\nindividual rights of indigenous women\u2019 (p. 76). In the final chapter in the agrarian\nsection Hvalkof examines the meanings assigned to \u2018 land \u2019 and \u2018 territory \u2019 in the\nhistory of indigenous politics in Peru over the last fifty years and assesses the\nparticipation of indigenous movements in civil society.\nIn terms of globalisation, the creation of spaces of neoliberalism and the impacts\non the livelihoods of men, women and children, the second section offers two useful\ncontributions. Chase takes the case of a steel-making company town in Brazil and\nexplores how industrial restructuring and privatisation has impacted upon local\nlivelihoods (and particularly those of women). This provides a valuable study of\na place that had benefited under the previous paradigm of import substitution\nindustrialisation. Furthermore, it points to some of the ways that livelihoods have\nbeen radically changed under the neoliberal model.\nHelen Safa develops her arguments about the links between female labour and\nglobalisation in the Dominican Republic. Her approach is perhaps too ambitious for\na small chapter. She tries to link themes of economic globalisation (such as trade\nand trade relations between the USA and the Dominican Republic and East Asian\ninvestment in the apparel industry) with not only political themes (the links between\nDominican trade unions in the export processing zones with trade unions in the\nUSA and Central America) but also cultural and social themes. In the latter focus,\nthe growing significance of female-headed households and the importance of\nextended families based on consanguineal kin for the survival of low-income\nhouseholds are explored.\nThe focus of the third section is supposed to be that of spaces, places and\npeople on the margins of neoliberalism. Gudeman and Rivera-Gutie\u00b4rrez develop\na largely theoretical chapter (influenced by Polanyi) that resulted from field\nresearch among urban, indigenous and peasant groups in Guatemala. The chapter\nexplores the relationship between the market and the community as allocators of\nlocal resources in particular places and how that relationship changes. Perhaps\nthis chapter would have been better located at the beginning of the book as two\nanthropologists argue that people participate in the market economy with the\ncommunity economy in mind and an array of interesting anecdotes are used to\nsupport these arguments.\nEscobar Latap\u0131\u00b4 and Gonza\u00b4lez de la Rocha switch the emphasis to urban Mexico\nand to Guadalajara in particular. In a heavily-referenced chapter, the authors explore\nthe changing political economy of Mexico since the 1970s and summarise the ex-\ntensive research on the survival strategies of poor urban households as these con-\nfront the impacts of macroeconomic restructuring. The changing nature of informal\nlabour markets and the role of international migration are two key processes that\nare addressed. The final chapter, by Pi-Sunyer, continues the Mexican theme but\nnow with reference to tourism in the Yucatan. Unfortunately there is relatively little\non the impacts of neoliberalism on tourist spaces as the chapter explores the con-\ncepts of geographical imaginations and Mayan ethnoscapes.\nChase\u2019s edited book provides a number of thoughtful essays around the theme of\nchanging political economy and local spaces. However, in order for these macro\nand micro phenomena to be linked more fully, it could be argued that there is a need\nsystematically to explore how the livelihoods of individuals and families (within\nlocalities) change. Unfortunately, the book provides relatively little on this from a\ntheoretical perspective although there are some useful empirical studies relating\n414 Reviews\nto this central question. It is also a shame that a book dedicated to spaces of neo-\nliberalism does not include one single map or figure. Nevertheless, the overall aim\nof the edited collection is ambitious and some useful contributions to the debate\nof how political economy impacts upon local spaces are made.\nR O B E R T GW YNN EUniversity of Birmingham\nJ.

Scholarly work in this area often takes an idealised version of the first presi-\ndential system, the United States, and conclusions drawn from decades of studying\nit as departure points. However, it is the consideration of the ways in which many\nof the constants that have become implicit in studies of the United States must be\nexplicitly conceptualised and allowed to vary in studies of Latin American systems\nthat has led to both theoretical innovation and accumulation of substantive findings.\nLegislative Politics in Latin America, edited by Morgenstern and Nacif, is a prime ex-\nample of how such work can lead to a more general model of legislative politics in\npresidential systems and enrich our understanding of politics across national cases.\nIn the introductory chapter Morgenstern groups the questions to be addressed\nin the volume into three broad categories : (1) questions about executive-legislative\nrelations ; (2) questions about parliamentary parties and legislative organisation\n(including procedural coalitions, committee systems, and floor voting coalitions) ;\nand (3) questions for policy studies. He convincingly argues that the independent\nvariables of greatest interest \u2013 relative constants in the United States \u2013 are legisla-\ntors\u2019 career goals, strategies to obtain those goals, the configuration of the party\nsystem, and the constitutional balance of power between branches. The book is then\ndivided into three substantive sections based on the categories of questions outlined\nabove, and each of these three sections contains four chapters \u2013 one on Argentina,\none on Brazil, one on Chile and one on Mexico. These country-specific chapters are\nauthored by some of the top scholars in the field, and at least one chapter on each\ncountry is authored by a scholar native to that country.\nThe richness and the detail of all twelve country-specific chapters cannot be\nsummarised in this brief review, but each stands alone as a thorough analysis of\nseveral questions in a single national setting. For example, regarding executive-\nlegislative relations, Amorim Neto analyses how Brazilian presidents used cabinet\nappointments proportional to parties\u2019 weight in the legislature to construct legislat-\nive coalitions. In the section on political parties and legislative structures, Carey\nexamines data on re-election rates, committee structures, and voting on the chamber\nfloor in Chile and concludes that despite extensive presidential powers granted by\nthe constitution, the legislature has the capacity and autonomy to serve as an effec-\ntive counterweight to the executive. On legislatures and the policy process, Eaton\nshows that because Argentine provincial party leaders played a key role in forming\ncandidate lists in their own districts, legislators were motivated to demand changes\nin the president\u2019s fiscal policy proposals in favour of the states. These few examples\nReviews 415\nare meant to show that the individual contributions are both very strong on their\nown and that they work together to offer a comprehensive picture of legislative\npolitics across a wide array of institutional settings.\nThe structure of the book constitutes a unique and effective \u2018 research design \u2019.\nBecause institutions are so slow to change in the United States, most of what we\nhave learned about the importance of institutions in presidential systems has\ncome from studies of a certain type : given institutions x and y, what is the effect\nof non-institutional factor w on political outcome z.1 The volume assembled by\nMorgenstern and Nacif more directly tests the effects of institutions because there\nis occasional variation in institutional arrangements over time within cases and a\ngreat deal of institutional variation across cases. Rather than taking institutional\ndesign as a given and testing the causal impact of non-institutional variables, \u2018 [h]is-\ntorical and comparative approaches, in contrast, have the potential to pose questions\nof the form: \u2018\u2018How does institutional arrangement x affect legislative behavior or\noutput y? \u2019\u2019 \u2019 (Gamm and Huber 2002, 339).2 The effectiveness of this design is made\nclear in the two concluding chapters. First, Morgenstern thematically returns to the\ndata on re-election rates, electoral systems, partisan alignments, and constitutional\npowers across cases. Based on the country-specific chapters and his own compara-\ntive analysis, he concludes that legislatures play mainly a reactive role, \u2018but within\nthis role there is great variance in the way in which legislatures assert their power\nand insert themselves in the policy process \u2019 \u2013 and a good deal of that variance is a\nsystematic function of institutional design (p. 413). Cox and Morgenstern author\nthe epilogue which provides a typology of executive-legislative relations. They\nargue that the president\u2019s changing use of constitutional and other powers in\nresponse to changes in anticipated assembly support constitutes the \u2018central oscil-\nlation\u2019 in Latin American politics (p. 450). Thus, likely support in the assembly,\nlargely a function of legislators\u2019 incentives institutionalised in candidate selection\nprocedures and general election laws, defines pairs of legislative and executive types.\nRecalcitrant assemblies reject the executive\u2019s initiatives and provoke imperial pre-\nsidents to undertake unilateral action. At the other extreme, subservient legislatures\nacquiesce to the preferences of dominant presidents. In between those stereotypical\npolar extremes, politics gets more interesting and complex. Workable assemblies\nare willing to bargain with presidents who build coalitions with cabinet posts,\npolicy concessions, and use of agenda-setting powers. Venal or parochial congresses\ntoo can be persuaded to support executives, but they demand payments which\nnationally-oriented presidents can meet with pork-barrel pay offs. The typology\noffered will undoubtedly lead others to generate testable hypotheses and, as a result,\nfurther theoretical and empirical advancements. In sum, this is an excellent work\nthat highlights the explanatory power of legislative institutions when they are studied\nwith well-articulated theoretical expectations, carefully collected data, and rigorous\nmethods of analysis. Cambridge University Press wisely chose to make a paperback\nversion available, and I have successfully used the volume in an upper division\nundergraduate course on Latin American politics and have assigned it to my\ngraduate students in a variety of courses.\nB R I A N F.
