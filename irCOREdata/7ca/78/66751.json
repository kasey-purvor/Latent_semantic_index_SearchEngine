SMITH\nDepartment of Anthropology, University of Durham, 43 Old Elvet, Durham\nSummary. From 626 ascendant genealogies, known as \u2018birth briefs\u2019, deposited\nby members of the Society of Genealogists in their London library, rates of\nconsanguineous marriage and coefficients of mean inbreeding (\u0001) of offspring\nwere estimated for cohorts of marriages contracted in the late nineteenth and\nearly twentieth centuries. The rate of first cousin marriage in the generation\nestimated to have married during the 1920s was 0\u00b732%, with no marriages\nbetween second cousins. The mean inbreeding coefficient for the offspring of\nthese marriages was estimated as 0\u00b70002. In the previous generation 1\u00b712% of\nthe marriages were between first cousins, and the estimate of mean inbreeding\nwas 0\u00b70007. Comparison with data taken from the published literature\nsuggests that the levels of cousin marriage observed are consistent with a\nsecular decline during the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries.\nIntroduction\nEstimation of the rate of consanguineous marriage and of mean inbreeding\ncoefficients in most of the United Kingdom has been hampered by the scarcity of\nRoman Catholic marriage records, which record dispensations granted to couples to\nmarry within the degrees of relationship prohibited by the Roman Catholic Church.\nThe availability of such archives elsewhere in Europe has furnished long time-series\nof data, for example in Belgium (Deraemaeker, 1958), Italy (Moroni, 1967; Pettener,\n1985), France (Sutter & Goux, 1962), Spain (Calderon, 1989) and Portugal (Abade,\n1983; Smith, Abade & Cunha, 1992). Where such records are absent, it is only\nexceptionally that some other source is an equivalent substitute, as in Finland, where\ncivil registration of cousin marriage has proved valuable (Jorde & Pitkanen, 1991).\nWhilst in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland Roman Catholic\ndispensations are widely available (Masterson, 1970; Kilpatrick, Mathers &\nStevenson, 1955), the bench-mark estimates of inbreeding in Britain, by contrast, have\nbeen based on individual surveys of the blood relationships of hospital patients\u2019\nparents (Pearson, 1908c; Bell, 1940; Pugh & Carter, reported in Coleman, 1980) or\nof marriage partners (Darwin, 1875; Pearson, 1908a, b, c; and Coleman, 1980).\n55\nGenealogies constructed from vital records or oral recall are another source of data\non inbreeding, but their application has been limited to reports on small isolated\npopulations, including especially a number of Scottish islands (Brennan, 1981;\nMorton et al., 1976; Sheets, 1981; Roberts, Roberts & Cowie, 1979). Exceptionally,\nevidence from dispensations has been obtained for Britain: Roman Catholic dispen-\nsations have been used to estimate mean inbreeding in the Hebridean island of\nEriskay (Robinson, 1983), and the registers of the Faculty Office record dispensations\nfor consanguineous and other prohibited marriages in England during the period\n1534\u20131540 (Smith et al., 1993).\nThe purpose of this paper is to report estimates of the frequency of cousin\nmarriage and mean inbreeding in the United Kingdom from an alternative source: the\nbilateral ascendant genealogies compiled as \u2018birth briefs\u2019 by members of the Society\nof Genealogists. Their consistency with estimates derived from the sources outlined\nabove is assessed, and variations over time and according to sample-base noted.\nData and methods\nThe library of the Society of Genealogists in London houses an extensive collection\nof birth briefs submitted by members who have investigated their own family\nhistories. A complete birth brief traces all branches of the family back five\ngenerations, from the compiler to the great-great-grandparents. The depth of such a\npedigree is identical to that referred to as a \u2018Seize Quartiers\u2019 by traditional\ngenealogists (Watson, n.d.). On the basis that each individual possesses a father and\na mother, sixteen great-great-grandparents should be expected, as shown in Fig. 1a.\nThere are, however, several ways in which such a genealogy can result in a reduced\nnumber of ancestors in generation I, and some but not all of these are associated with\nan inbred descendant (Fig. 1b\u2013f). In recording the birth brief in such cases, the slots\nfor the sixteen potential ancestors in generation I are occupied by fewer than sixteen\ndifferent names.\nMany of the birth briefs submitted to the Society of Genealogists are incomplete,\nand for this paper only those in which named individuals had been identified in at\nleast fifteen of the sixteen ancestor-slots were considered eligible for inclusion. It is\nargued that if fifteen ancestors have been identified it can be assumed that the\nsixteenth was an unknown individual, and not one of the fifteen already identified\ncropping up again as a parent to another of the great-grandparents. Data were\ncollected from eligible birth briefs submitted by 626 members of the Society of\nGenealogists born in the UK. The proportion of eligible records submitted by persons\nof UK birth comprises roughly 40% of all birth briefs, estimated on the basis of a\ncount of the numbers bound in Volumes 17 and 18 in the Society of Genealogists\u2019\nLibrary. It is assumed that these records are accurate.\nFrom these ascendant genealogies the frequencies of consanguineous unions up to\nand including marriage between second cousins were calculated for the couples\nmarrying in generation IV. By using the individuals in generation IV as the starting\npoint for their own antecedents, the frequency of first cousin marriage in generation\nIII was also estimated, and with caution the comparison of rates of cousin marriage\nbetween generations III and IV can be interpreted as a chronological succession. The\n56 M. T. Smith\nFig. 1. Birth briefs: some variant forms of ascendant genealogy.\nCousin marriage and inbreeding in the United Kingdom 57\nmean inbreeding coefficient of the population (\u0001) was calculated as the average of the\ninbreeding coefficients of individuals derived from pedigrees.\nAttributing dates to the marriages in the birth briefs can be no more than\ntentative, as the sampled genealogies derive from individuals with a wide range of\ndates of birth, as shown in Fig. 2. The modal decade of birth of generation V (the\ncompilers of the genealogies) was the 1930s, and if a generation time of 30 years is\nassumed, the 1900s can roughly be designated as the modal birth decade of their\nparents, though necessarily with a wider spread of dates. It is reasonable to assume\nthat these births represent marriages that took place up to 10 years beforehand, and\nso the estimated modal decades of marriage would be the 1920s for marriages in\ngeneration IV and the 1890s for marriages in generation III.\nComparative figures for rates of consanguineous marriage and inbreeding in\nEngland and Scotland have been taken from the published literature and are\nsummarized in Table 1. With the exception of recent medical interest in minority\npopulations (Bundey et al., 1991; Darr & Modell, 1988), there is little more systematic\nknowledge of variation in inbreeding in Britain than this handful of publications\naffords. The following paragraphs briefly describe these data and, in order to look for\nevidence of secular trend in inbreeding among all these studies, an attempt has been\nmade to assign a time period for the marriages represented by each of the reported\nstudies using reasoning as above in relation to the birth briefs, but this can generally\nbe no more than an approximation, especially in cases where the data come from\nadult patients with no other indication of their age.\nAccordingly, this study attributes to the parents of adult hospital in-patients\nsurveyed by Bell (1940) marriages dated within the range of years 1850\u20131920, and to\nthe marriages of parents of Bell\u2019s sample in-patients aged less than 15 years the\nsomewhat more restricted range of 1915\u20131925.\nIn order to look for secular trend in the proportion of first cousin marriages, Bell\ndivided her sample into four categories according to the patients\u2019 age. The age groups\nof those patients \u2013 of under 15 years, 15\u201339, 40\u201364 and over 64 \u2013 have been\ninterpreted to represent parents\u2019 marriages contracted in the periods 1915\u20131925,\n1890\u20131920, 1865\u20131895 and 1850\u20131870 respectively. These cohorts are deliberately not\nexclusive, reflecting the coarseness of this estimate. All that is known about Bell\u2019s two\nFig. 2. Decade of birth of compilers of birth briefs.\n58 M. T.

In 1908\nPearson reported data collected \u2018for a period of some years\u2019 at the Great Ormond\nStreet Hospital for Sick Children on the consanguinity of 700 couples whose children\nwere brought for treatment (Pearson, 1908c). Relationships up to third cousin were\nreported, and it is assumed that these marriages occurred between 1880 and 1905.\nG. H. Darwin (1875) circulated a questionnaire, probably in 1873, to about 800\n\u2018members of the upper middle and upper classes\u2019 enquiring about cousin marriage in\nthe present and previous generation. These marriages have been tentatively assigned\nto the period 1800\u20131870.\nThe data from Orkney (Brennan, 1981) are organized into cohorts of married\ncouples based on the birth date of the groom. In assigning marriage dates below, it\nwas assumed that marriage took place when the groom was 25 years old. This is likely\nto be an underestimate, but will not bring any serious bias in the scale of time\nexamined here. Thus Brennan\u2019s cohort 1800\u20131854 becomes this study\u2019s marriage\ncohort 1825\u20131870. Coleman (1980) and Robinson (1983) both analysed marriages\ndirectly, so the dates given in their papers are unchanged here.\nResults\nTable 1 shows the proportion of cousin marriages and the mean inbreeding\ncoefficients calculated from them, in comparison with selected data taken from the\npublished literature on the British Isles. Among 626 marriages in generation IV there\nwere two between first cousins, and none between second cousins. Among 1252\nmarriages in generation III, there were fourteen between first cousins, yielding a rate\nof first cousin marriage of 0\u00b732% in generation IV and of 1\u00b712% in generation III.\nMean inbreeding coefficients based on these data are 0\u00b70002 for the children of\ngeneration IV, and 0\u00b70007 for the children of generation III.\nThe inbreeding coefficients estimated from the present survey data show a greater\nrange than the results obtained by Bell (1940). The value estimated from birth briefs\nfor the 1890s is higher (\u0001=0\u00b70007) than Bell\u2019s value for the parents of adult patients\n(\u0001=0\u00b70004, marriage cohort estimated as 1850\u20131920), and for the 1920s is lower\n(\u0001=0\u00b70002) than for the parents of Bell\u2019s patients under 15 years of age (\u0001=0\u00b70003,\nmarriage cohort estimated as 1915\u20131935); the results are, however, consistent with the\nsecular trend shown by her data. The data reported by Pearson (1908c) from the\ncasebooks of the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children in London show\na rate of cousin marriage in the estimated period 1880\u20131905 of 0\u00b7857%, a little lower\nthan the birth briefs for the same period (1\u00b712%) and a little higher than Bell\u2019s\n(0\u00b7606%). Mean inbreeding among these children (\u0001=0\u00b70002) is half the rate of Bell\nfor the equivalent period (\u0001=0\u00b70004, marriage cohort estimated as 1850\u20131920) and\nless than a third the rate from birth briefs (\u0001=0\u00b70007, marriage cohort 1890s).\n60 M.

Smith\nPugh and Carter (reported by Coleman, 1980) found inbreeding levels among the\nparents of children attending the Hospital for Sick Children as out-patients in 1950\/51\n(marriage period estimated as 1925\u20131945) to be the same as those recorded by Bell\nfor the parents of in-patients up to the age of 15 years, whilst Coleman (1980)\nreported a lower value (0\u00b70001) in his survey of marriages taking place in Reading in\n1972\/3. Both the studies on Scottish Islands indicate levels of inbreeding generally an\norder higher than the English data.\nBell\u2019s data hint at a secular decrease in first cousin marriage through time, but\nthe trend is subverted by her oldest age-category having the second lowest rate of\nfirst cousin marriage. The estimates from the two generations sampled by the birth\nbriefs suggest a decline in first cousin marriage in Britain during the twentieth\ncentury, which is consistent with the general trend of the other English data, the\nScottish data from Orkney (Brennan, 1981) and the pattern evident from Europe.\nThe English and Scottish data on rates of first cousin marriage described above\nare plotted in Fig. 3 against the periods of time, in 5-year periods, to which the\nmarriages have been allocated. The high levels of inbreeding calculated from\ndispensations in the island of Eriskay (Robinson, 1983) were achieved without any\nmarriages between first cousins at all and these zero values from Eriskay have been\nomitted from the graph.\nDiscussion\nThe values of inbreeding calculated from birth briefs seem broadly consistent with the\npattern of results reported for England by Bell (1940) and Coleman (1980) from\nsurvey results. The results from England contrast with those from Scotland, which are\nderived from remote rural or island populations and which show higher levels of\ninbreeding than the English data. This difference may reflect actual variations in mean\ninbreeding levels, or may be attributable to the various data sources employed and\ntheir ability to detect remote kinship. Pedigrees reconstructed from vital records tend\nto capture more remote kinship, which can evade oral recall of relationship and\ndispensation testimony (Robinson, 1983).\nFor first cousin marriage the situation appears rather different, with the results\nfrom Orkney being similar to those in England, whilst first cousin marriages are\ncompletely absent from the records from Eriskay. It is possible that in this Roman\nCatholic community (where more remote blood relationship in marriage was very\ncommon, as evidenced by the high mean inbreeding coefficients) dispensations to\nmarry first cousins were not granted. Robinson (1983) noted that the parish priest\nwould not sanction endogamous marriages among the present-day population of\nEriskay, and similar strictures might well have applied in the past.\nThe high rate of first cousin marriage (3\u00b741%) discovered by G. H. Darwin (1875)\nis likely, by his own analysis of estimates based on the frequency of isonymous\nmarriage, to indicate a greater preference for cousin marriage among the Victorian\nupper classes to whom he sent his circular, than among the middle and working\nclasses. Certainly, in the milieu of the Darwin family cousin marriage was common,\nwith both Charles Darwin (G. H. Darwin\u2019s father) and his sister Caroline marrying\nWedgewood cousins (Desmond & Moore, 1991), and extensive cousin marriage\nCousin marriage and inbreeding in the United Kingdom 61\nF\nig\n.\n3.\nR\nat\nes\nof\nfir\nst\nco\nus\nin\nm\nar\nri\nag\ne\nin\nth\ne\nU\nni\nte\nd\nK\nin\ngd\nom\n.\n62 M. T. Smith\nhaving been documented (Anderson, 1986), though not quantified, elsewhere among\nthe Victorian intellectual and artistic elite.\nThere are other indications of local variation in consanguinity rates according to\ncultural practice and population structure. Bell (1940) noted the relatively high levels\nof cousin marriage reported by \u2018country [general] practitioners from districts where,\nit was rumoured, a good deal of intermarriage among relatives had occurred\u2019. The\nlow value of mean inbreeding among the parents of children treated at the Great\nOrmond Street Hospital may be consistent with a reduction in kin marriage through\nmigration to the metropolis, a view to which Pearson (1908c) was inclined in\ncommenting on the same data. Unfortunately the birth briefs data used in this study\ndo not allow systematic investigation of socioeconomic variation in consanguinity,\nthough geographical variation could be pursued in further research.\nIn the birth briefs data, the complete absence of marriages in generation IV\nbetween second cousins is noteworthy, since it is not consistent with the expectations\nof a random mating model, which predicts consanguineous marriages of different\ndegree to occur as a function of the relative frequencies of such relationships in the\npopulation. Expected rates of consanguineous marriage under varying circumstances\nwere modelled by Hajnal (1963), who showed that under random mating, for\nwhatever values of the population size and migration, the number of second cousin\nmarriages is predicted to exceed the number of marriages between first cousins. That\nit does not do so here is consistent with the survey of marriages in Reading 1972\/3\nconducted by Coleman (1980) and suggests, following Wachter (1976), that the\nfrequencies of marriages between first cousins and between second cousins should not\nbe regarded as occurring merely as a function of the frequencies of those relatives in\nthe population, but should rather be conceptualized as separate categories of activity.\nIn contrast to the absence of second cousin marriages reported in the birth briefs,\nWatson (n.d.), recording the Seize Quartiers of twelve kings and queens of England,\npresented pedigrees showing that in all three cases where there were fewer than sixteen\nancestors, the monarch\u2019s or consort\u2019s parents were second cousins. This presumably\nreflects the closed nature of the gene pool of European royalty compared with that\nof commoners and the arrangement of marriages to consolidate wealth and cement\nalliances.\nIt can be observed in Fig. 1 that the degree of inbreeding does not reliably accord\nwith the reduction of ancestors, and the question is therefore raised here of whether\nthe number of ancestors has any independent significance in terms of population\nstructure. Although it does not predict the probability of autozygosity, it does convey\na sense, indeed a measure, of the diversity of the gene pool from which the\ndescendant\u2019s genes are derived. The practical limitation most likely to be encountered\nis in the scarcity and bias of available data, the number of pedigrees extending back\nto more than 32 ancestors being small, and limited almost exclusively to royalty and\nthe nobility. Forst de Battaglia (1949) refers to a number of such published accounts,\na very few of which (for example, that of Kaiser Wilhelm II) extend back even to the\n4096 ancestor level. Typically, the number of ancestors is much reduced, as for\nexample in the case of King George VI of the United Kingdom, whose antecedents\nat the generation for whom there are 1024 theoretical ancestors numbered 400 actual\nindividuals (Forst da Battaglia, 1949).\nCousin marriage and inbreeding in the United Kingdom 63\nAs to the accuracy of the birth briefs themselves, care must be taken that their\nnature does not introduce bias for one reason or another. One possible cause of\ninflation of values is ascertainment bias. Inbred pedigrees should be easier to\ncomplete, as they contain fewer ancestors than the full sixteen, with a fourteen-\nancestor generation I being 7\/8 as difficult to complete as a sixteen, and a twelve\nancestor one 3\/4 as difficult. Accordingly, they may be over-represented among the\ncategory of eligible pedigrees. A \u2018correction\u2019 applied on this basis would reduce the\nestimate of the frequency of cousin marriages in generation IV to 0\u00b784%, and in\ngeneration III to 0\u00b728%. Another possible source of bias is the self-selection of people\nwith sufficient an interest in their family trees to become members of the Society of\nGenealogists, though in the present day, it has to be admitted, family history is an\ninterest with a very broad appeal. What is not clear is whether a currently prevailing\nsocietal attitude that is mildly inimical to cousin marriage, might deter someone\ndiscovering consanguinity among their ancestors from persevering with the project,\nthough the experience of meeting many family historians and discussing cousin\nmarriage in their family trees suggests that this would not be a deterrent.\nThe possibility of selection biases has long dogged the collection of data on\nconsanguinity in the UK. The surveys of hospital patients might over-represent\ninbreeding through the representation of diseases with some recessive genetic basis,\nthough this can to some extent be guarded against by the selection of categories of\npatient (Bell, 1940). Karl Pearson himself solicited data (Pearson, 1908a, b) that have\nnot been used in this comparative analysis since they are likely to be strongly subject\nto self-selection bias, a view first expressed by Pearson when he reported them\n(Pearson, 1908c). In two letters to the editor of the British Medical Journal in May\n1908 Pearson requested readers to send a postcard stating (among other things)\nwhether they and their spouses were cousins, and whether their maternal or paternal\ngrandparents were cousins. Many respondents sent unsolicited information about\ntheir parents\u2019 consanguinity as well, and the data, published the following month\n(Pearson, 1908c), showed 4\u00b769% first cousin marriages among the respondents. Total\nconsanguinity (marriage between cousins of any degree) among the respondents was\n8\u00b737%, among their parents 16\u00b715%, and among their grandparents 3\u00b762%. These are\nstrikingly high values in comparison with any encountered from the UK apart from\nDarwin\u2019s (Darwin, 1875), and high compared with the rates among parents of\nchildren treated at the Great Ormond Street Children\u2019s Hospital, which Pearson\nreported in the same paper, and which have been used in the analysis above. It was\nthe variation between generations (rather than the high rates themselves), together\nwith the marked reduction in consanguinity rates between respondents to Pearson\u2019s\nfirst and second letters in the British Medical Journal, that led Pearson to infer that\nhis first appeal may have been misinterpreted and that \u2018a good many replies were\nreceived because my correspondents were the children of cousins or had married\ncousins\u2019 (Pearson, 1908c).\nThis paper has reported rates of marriage between first and second cousins using\nbirth briefs as the data source, and the results have been shown to be consistent with\nthe twentieth century pattern of consanguinity in the UK indicated by other published\ndata. Possible sources of bias in the collection of consanguinity data have been\nconsidered, and it seems likely on the evidence of this paper that sufficient numbers\n64 M. T.
