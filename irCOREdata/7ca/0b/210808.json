Jones \n \nAbstract \nIn South Africa, new gated communities have begun branding themselves as \u201ceco-\nestates,\u201d \u201cgame estates,\u201d \u201cnature estates,\u201d and \u201cforest estates.\u201d This is indicative of the \nway in which the marketing and consumption of nature has become prominent in the \nproduction and consumption of gated communities. A particular emphasis is placed on \nthe use of native or indigenous plant species in landscape design. Suburbanites seeking to \nescape the increasingly mixed and threatening post-apartheid city are offered a chance to \nreconnect with nature in eco-estates. Where largely white elites often feel a precarious \nhold in the new South Africa, natural heritage offers attachment to place. These natural \nlandscapes are highly selective engagements with the local. Nature-oriented gated \ncommunities offer spaces which exclude problematic plants and people alike. Yet, while \nattempting to capitalize on this new gardening trend, developers have risked alienating \nconventional gardeners of exotic horticultural plants. The result has been the strategic \naccommodation of different material expressions of landscape.   \n \n \nKey Words: Elites, Gated Communities, Landscapes, Nature, South Africa \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2 \nIt is not enough to call yourself an African because of a geographical accident of \nbirth. Sometimes I find myself despising white people who speak of their love for \nAfrican landscapes, sunsets, African wildlife \u2013 but never the African people, not \nthe people. Africa is not a film set! (Johnson 2006, 188)  \n \nHome to a pair of Crowned Eagles nesting in a Marula Tree, Blythedale Coastal \nResort offers a rich heritage of natural flora and fauna \u2026 Find your future. There \nis nothing wrong with living in the past. Not if it means having space to grow in a \nplace where old-worldly values still ring true. (Blythedale estate, no date) \n \n \nSince the transition to democracy in 1994, South Africa\u2019s urban landscape has been \ntransformed by the advent of gated communities. Where new homes for the middle \nclasses and elites were once built in racially exclusive suburbs, they are increasingly built \nin private estates. The overriding motivation to invest in these new neighborhoods is \ngenerally held to be a fear of crime. A raft of studies, as well as regular newspaper reports \nand television documentaries, indicate higher levels of fear among South Africans than \nmost other countries, including high levels of fear associated with home and the night \n(Dirsuweit 2002; Roberts 2008). Alongside the desire to escape crime, gated communities \ncan be seen as a spatial strategy to deal with less tangible anxieties of social change \n(Hook and Vrdoljak 2002; Ballard 2004a; Durington 2006; Lemanski 2006). Those elite, \nmostly white, South Africans who have felt socially and politically alienated from society \nhave engaged a variety of spatial practices in order to resolve their dissonance. Alongside \nemigration, gated communities can be seen as a kind of geographical escapism. They \nattempt to restore feelings of safety and control that were enabled by the earlier state-led \nspatial strategy of apartheid. With their assured purchasing power, relatively affluent \npeople have invested in developments that promise to ensure not only their material but \nalso existential comfort.  \n \nAs in similar developments around the world, gated communities require security \nfeatures such as hard walling, razor wire and fortified motifs (Ellin 1997; Caldeira 1999; \n 3 \nLow 2005). In South Africa these designs are sometimes taken a stage further through the \n\u201csecurity park\u201d (see Hook and Vrdoljak 2002). Yet developers hoping to attract more \naffluent buyers cannot afford to produce generic cluster housing and have sought various \nways to create a sense of place through architecture and landscape themes. In Durban, the \nreproduction of rural or pre-industrial European landscapes such as Tudor, Cotswold, \nTuscan for example, is pregnant with neo-traditionalist symbolism (see Jacobs 1996; \nDuncan and Duncan 2004). However, the attempt to deploy the familiar idyll of rural pre-\nindustrial gentrified Europe (Williams 2005, 82) seems to offer an overly Europhile motif \nfor many of those seeking a more local sense of place. A little truer to the history of the \nregion is the use of \u201cNatal colonial,\u201d \u201cveranda,\u201d \u201cVictorian,\u201d and \u201cfarm cottage\u201d \narchitectural styles which hark back to a period of paternalistic sugar barons (cf. Bunn \n1996) and agricultural landscapes. Alongside these local references, the scramble for a \ndistinctive identity by developers has resulted in the successful deployment of novel \nstyles unrelated to the region including \u201cAmerican Colonial\u201d and \u201cBali.\u201d In our \ninterviews, the consumers of these various styles find them functionally conducive to \ntheir desire for neat and presentable neighborhoods, but with many claiming to be \nindifferent to the symbolism of European gentry or colonialism from Natal or America.  \n \nThis indifference seems, at first blush, to be paradoxical. Elite households appear to be \nmoving in significant numbers to live in new residential arrangements, spending \nconsiderable amounts of money and often trading down in terms of property size, with \nlittle appreciation of the architectural or design symbolism. We explore some of these \nissues in a separate article (Jones and Ballard no date) but here wish to argue that it is \nnature which offers a more direct and less contestable route to an appealing sense of \nheritage. South Africa\u2019s rich diversity of plants and animals has long been enjoyed \nrecreationally by suburbanites in their escapes from the city. Recently conservationists \nhave succeeded in persuading many of these suburbanites to bring more of this nature \ninto their domestic spaces by gardening with native or indigenous plants. Developers \nhave seized on this trend as a way of inviting affluent urban residents to purchase \u201ca \nreconnection with the land,\u201d to borrow Swart\u2019s wording (2008, 204). These new \nresidential communities deploy the environment in the production of communities and \n 4 \nplace by offering landscapes that have been produced with indigenous plants and have \npreserved original forests and grasslands. In one estimation, \u201ceco-estates\u201d went from \nbeing a virtually unknown concept to numbering more than 50 across South Africa within \njust a few years (Koblitz 2006). Many more estates that do not adopt this label do \nnevertheless make extensive use of nature in design and marketing.  \n \nIn this article we offer an analysis of the role of nature in the production and consumption \nof elite gated communities in South Africa. From 2006 to 2008 we conducted interviews \nwith 29 people, including residents of gated communities, developers, a chair of a board \nof trustees, an estate manager, a landscape architect and an environmental activist. They \nwere associated with 9 different estates in the Durban region. In addition to interviews, \nwe examined online marketing material and housing industry and real-estate publications, \nsome of which referred to estates in other parts of South Africa. We are also informed by \nmaterial from our longer term research on whiteness and integration in Durban. In \nexamining the advent of nature-oriented gated communities, we argue that it is important \nto consider some of the relationships between whiteness and landscape. This is not to say \nthat identification with such landscapes is a necessary or exclusive property of people \nwho get included in the enduring colonial-apartheid category of \u201cwhite\u201d. As a greater \nrange of people beyond this category buy eco-estate homes, more work on class, race, \nlandscape and taste is required. What we are able to do here is consider the legacy and \nevolution of European landscape practice in South Africa in relation to these new kinds \nof development and in so doing contribute to part of the explanation of their appearance. \nThe search for \u201ca psychic accommodation with \u2018the land\u2019\u201d has been central to European\u2019s \nsearch for belonging in processes of South African Nationhood (Foster 2008, 2). Now \nthat white minority rule has been consigned to history, we consider, along with Hughes, \nhow it is that whites continue to enlist nature in order to \u201c[enter] postcolonialism feeling \nat home\u201d (2006, 837).  \n \nIn Part A, we situate the recent uptake of indigenous landscaping by housing developers \nin the relationship between nature and gardening in general and in the South African \ncontext. A broad tension emerges between, global and hybrid models of nature in which \n 5 \nlandscapes are substantially altered by human intervention, and purist local models of \nnature which idealize original landscapes. In South Africa, nature in its ostensibly \nunaltered form was enjoyed widely amongst white people as rural game reserves, while \nthe kind of nature that characterized living spaces tended to be substantially altered. \nGardens generally consisted of global horticultural plants rather than an attempt to \npreserve or reproduce the pre-development landscape. More recently, however, idealized \nnature has been brought into the domestic sphere of the garden far more explicitly by a \ngrowing indigenous gardening movement. This, we argue, has open ended political \nimplications with some of its advocates linking their project to racial reconciliation and \nothers more conservatively positioning themselves as stewards of the environment in \ncontrast to what they believe to be the environmentally damaging poor black population.  \n \nPart B examines the uptake of indigenous landscaping and nature motifs in gated \ncommunity marketing material and the enjoyment of nature by residents who have moved \nin. In selling estates to the middle class and elites, a specific notion of nature has rapidly \nbecome a crucial element in security-lifestyle packages. For those who buy in, gardening \naesthetics are aligning with nature enjoyment aesthetics and conservation ethics. In this \nway the production and marketing of nature becomes an essential tool for developers to \ncapture their slice of the lucrative elite housing market. This finding echoes research on \ndevelopments in other parts of the world (e.g. Guterson 1992; Till 2001). In the context \nof the post-apartheid city, however, it amounts to a new element in the repertoire of a \n\u201cpolitics of aesthetics\u201d (Duncan and Duncan 1997, 170) where class and, for some, race \nare marked through landscape taste (also see Lee 1995). The content of this aesthetic is \nitself metaphoric. Anxieties over mixing of plants exist in parallel with anxieties of social \nmixing and political change. Indigenous landscaping represents a certain kind of localism \nand attachment to place amongst a group of people who feel in many other ways \n\u201cdisplaced.\u201d Furthermore, fears that sophisticated climax ecologies being threatened by \nunruly weeds echo a dread that the achievements of modernity and civilization are now \nbeing undone in post-apartheid South Africa. The ability to channel vast resources into \nthe production and maintenance of indigenous landscapes allows residents to attempt to \n 6 \nreassert control over what they consider to be deteriorating social and natural \nenvironments. Social and botanical communities are thus co-defined and policed.  \n \nYet, as our empirical case shows, the legacy of European relationships with nature has \nresulted in various competing landscape aesthetics, and many consumers of gated \ncommunity homes have not converted to the indigenous fashion. Only some purist estates \nwere successfully able to apply an exclusively indigenous planting rule. In other cases, \nsuch attempts backfired. The atmosphere of one community we visited had been \nnegatively affected by a dispute between indigenous gardeners and those who wanted to \nplant exotic horticultural plants. Other developers had carefully steered a course between \nthe two fractions by claiming the ethical capital of indigenous gardening but, in practice, \nusing large numbers of \u201cnon-invasive\u201d exotic plants \u201cfor color.\u201d Equally innovatively, \nthey have used indigenous plants to landscape English country gardens. The paper \nexplores some of these tensions and accommodations between different ideals of place \nmaking.    \n \nPart A: \u201cBring nature back to your garden\u201d \nWithin the myriad of ways in which humans and non humans come into relationship with \none another, gardens are significant for the density of intimate relations between people \nand constellations of invited and uninvited \u201ccompanion species\u201d (Haraway 2008, also see  \nSwyngedouw 1996; Chevalier 1998; Bhatti and Church 2001; Head and Muir 2006; \nLonghurst 2006; Bhatti, et al. 2009). Gardens are the sites in which living nature is \nenlisted in domestic consumption, production and reproduction. As well as being \nendogenous domestic enterprises, they serve as connections to the greater social and \nnatural environment. Given their symbolic and material importance, people often have \npassionate feelings on the constellations of plants and animals they encounter within their \nhome space. As a result, gardens are at some level managed spaces that rely on \ntechnology such as hybridization, mass plant production, chemical control, and \nmechanical and human labor. These might serve idiosyncratic preferences or they might \nbe intended for more public consumption by friends and neighbors, gardening peers and \n 7 \nfuture buyers of the home. Gardens convey particular identities and can simultaneously \ndisplay aesthetic, social and market values.  \n \nWhile gardens are clearly cultural artifacts, they cannot simply be positioned as the \nantithesis of natural wilderness (Palmer 2004). Regardless of gardeners\u2019 \u201csense of control \nover a small patch of earth,\u201d gardens remain subject to the vagaries of nature (Francis and \nHester 1991, 6). Not only are gardeners aware of the fact that elements of the garden are \ngoing to do their own thing, but many derive much pleasure from this unpredictability \n(Hitchings 2006). Pesticide averse gardeners hope that their gardens will be used by \ninsects, birds and animals (Dawson 1991) and that ecological processes will occur there \nsuch as composting, carbon absorption and oxygen production. Yet for some, the \npresence of plants and animals, and the agency of nature itself, are not enough to make \ngardens natural. As we are reminded by a book produced in Durban advocating \nindigenous gardening called Bring nature back to your garden (Botha and Botha 1995), \nthere is long held view that conventional suburban gardens are anything but natural, and \namount to little more than green deserts. Not only is this concern held by some gardeners \nbut has occurred frequently in the literature. Lewis Mumford argued that developers of \nAmerican suburbs accentuated the conformity of landscape and planting, in line with the \nsocial, economic and aesthetic conformity that resulted in a \u201clow-grade environment\u201d \n(Mumford 1961, 486). Indeed, both in the mimetic of the \u201cgarden city\u201d and the platted \ndevelopments of the US and Canadian mid-West city the chemically sustained lawn and \nmonotonous planting at the expense of indigenous flora are synonymous with the suburb \n(Jackson 1987; Robbins and Sharp 2003)1.  \n \nIn reaction to what is seen as the environmental poverty of suburbia, conservationist \ngardeners and landscapers have advocated closer adherence to the form and content of \nunaltered nature (Trieb 1999). Hitchmough and Dunnett (2004) call for the inclusion of \nmore ecological processes in gardening. This, they say, would require a value shift from \nwanting to exaggerate nature in gardens by creating more \u201ccolour and drama\u201d to an \nappreciation of the more mundane appearance of semi natural planting (Hitchmough and \nDunnett 2004, 4). Elsewhere, gardeners are encouraged to be holistic, considering the \n 8 \nneeds of plants rather than treating them as merely ornamental (Hill 2001, 50). The idea \nof living \u201cin harmony with pristine settings and endangered species\u201d has become integral \nto new urbanist communities in the United States (Till 2001, 225). These more ecological \ntreatments of gardening can be contextualized within the long held disquiet amongst \nconservationists of humanity\u2019s role as \u201cimprovers of nature\u201d and the romantic longing for \nunaltered nature (Williams 2005, 78). These ecological discourses privilege \n\u201cgroundedness in place, and intimacy with one\u2019s immediate surroundings,\u201d a search for \n\u201chomeliness and rootedness\u201d (Clark 2002, 105).  \n \nOne of the main results of the ecological or naturalist gardening lobby has been to re-\nvalue plants on the basis of their origin. Many plant collectors over centuries have prized \nspecimens precisely because they are from elsewhere. In the metropole this tied into \nideologies of exploration and colonialism. In the colonies, gardening could reproduce \nlandscapes from home (Anderson 2003; Longhurst 2006). Yet as that home was defined \nthrough its relationship to its empire, a globalised stock of plants and animals could be \ndeployed in the production of these new nations (Draper 2003, 70; also Veracini 2007, \n272). As the objective of design in the production of outdoor domestic spaces grew, the \norigin of plants mattered less. Gardening manuals and nurseries frequently provide a \nmenu of globalized horticultural plants of no specific origin, organized by their \nlandscaping function, color, size, hardiness, or sun tolerance. By contrast, ecological \ngardeners have reintroduced an interest in determining whether a plant belongs to a place. \nBroadly they argue that local plants are more useful to local fauna and facilitate \nfunctioning ecology rather than decorative, sterile and out of place horticultural plants. \nFurthermore, some exotic or non-native plants have been highly damaging to the \nenvironment. This alien vegetation, undisciplined by natural predators, swamps delicately \nbalanced local plants and animals (Clark 2002; Head and Muir 2006; Waitt, Gill and \nHead 2009). The result, it is feared, is the loss of local diversity, extinction, and the \nhomogenization of the environment into \u201cone giant mongrel ecology\u201d (Hettinger 2001, \n216). The resulting ideal is a kind of eco-essentialism, in which nature is facilitated by \nreturning to the kinds of plants, animals and landscapes that existed locally before human \ninduced alteration.  \n 9 \n \nGardening and nature in South Africa  \n \nEnglish [immigrants] \u2026 always persist, with homesick pigheadedness, in trying \nto grow \u201can English garden,\u201d instead of drawing upon the immense resources of \nthe native flora \u2013 a weakness upon which your born South African looks with \nabsolute sympathy; after all, were not the oaks and roses, the apples and pears of \nhis pride brought originally from Europe? (Cran 1927, 48)  \n \nMarion Cran, a gardening travel writer, published The Gardens of Good Hope in 1927 \nbased on two visits to the Union earlier in the decade. She hoped to tell \u201cEngland, the \ngarden land, that there are gardens in South Africa!\u201d (Cran 1927, 5), despite her own \nexpectation of \u201cdrought and dust, or deserts of sand and cactus\u201d (Cran 1927, 134). She \nreported that varieties of roses were being hybridised to survive in the warmer climates of \nAustralia and South Africa. Cran also wrote enthusiastically of the potential of local \nplants: \u201cAnkle deep in violets; knee deep in arum lilies; waist high in wild gladioli. So \none wades in Africa \u2013 as one wades here in England among the buttercups in the May \nmeadows\u201d (Cran 1927, 134). Cran\u2019s text is useful not only for highlighting the colonial \nrelationships with imported and local plants, but also for her comments on the owners of \nthose gardens. Unlike the \u201cemasculated folk\u201d of overpopulated European cities, she found \nin South Africa a courageous, likeable and hospitable people creating a new nation (1927, \n174). She felt it appropriate to devote attention to settlers in a book about gardening \nbecause she \u201cthought that the transplanting of people is a kind of gardening too\u201d (1927, \n174). \n  \nThe health of the colonial environment in contrast to the polluted and overcrowded cities \nof the metropole was a major attraction for migrants and performed an important role to \nplacate concerns of disease and tropical malaise (Anderson, W. 1997). Abundant space \nallowed for both the enjoyment and exploitation of nature. The land was being improved \nby the migration of people, plants and animals (Anderson 1998; Comaroff and Comaroff \n 10 \n2001; Clark 2002; Draper 2003; Swart 2008). While many colonists considered the \nincreasing alteration of the landscape to reinforce their dominance and transcendence of \nnature (Anderson, K. 1997), concerns about environmental deterioration were evident in \nthe South African colonies from early in the 1800s. Blame was attributed variously to \nAfrican populations for removing trees and to the rapid transformation of the landscape \nas a result of colonial agriculture and development (Grove 1989). In Natal, sugar and \ntimber plantations resulted in rapid enclosure and clearance from the mid 1800s. The \nconsequences of degradation were thought to be drought, loss of hunting grounds, and by \nthe more botanically minded, a loss of valuable plant habitat. As Grove explained, early \nconservationists in Southern Africa argued that the preservation of nature was a virtue of \ncivilization, although this boast disguised the more anxious search to regain control over \nsocial and natural environments. To preserve forests and buffer expanding colonial \nagriculture and African populations, game reserves were established in the Cape in 1856 \n(Grove 1989). In Natal Hluhluwe and Umfolozi game reserves, were proclaimed in 1895 \ninitially with a strong interests in preserving hunting grounds (Brooks 2005; Draper \n2000) and subsequently were responsible for saving the white rhino. The later \nestablishment of the Kruger National Park in 1926 to the North promoted the access of \nrural spaces by rail as an antidote for urban life on the Witwatersrand.  \n \nThe designation of game reserves and the all indigenous National Botanic Gardens in \n1913 were key to the project of white nationhood (Foster 2008). These spaces also \ninformed an increasingly urban industrial population\u2019s relationship with wilderness. \nReserves functioned \u201cas an imaginary repository of value forms lost in the process of \nmodernization\u201d (Bunn 1996, 38, also see Draper 1998). They were nostalgic spaces that \nwere thought of as existing outside of or predating industrial time (Brooks 2000). They \ndistilled nature and separated it from culture, although the enjoyment of nature became \nincreasingly important to suburban culture. While parading as unaltered wilderness, they \nwere spaces that were actively produced in order to offer an idealized pre-human Eden \nwhich could be enjoyed by nature lovers (Draper, Spierenburg and Wels 2004, 343). \nNotably, the reserves required the relocation of many subjugated people and their cattle \nin order to create idealized African landscapes (Brooks 2005).  \n 11 \n \nIn urban areas too, nature played a key role in the establishment of a white nation. \nEuropean immigrants who had made their fortunes in Johannesburg sought to constitute \ntheir relationship with their adoptive land through specific architectural and landscaping \nstyles. On the Parktown Ridge, the celebrated architect Herbert Baker built grand \nunadorned houses using local rock and naturalistic gardening style at times incorporating \nindigenous plants or unaltered part of the veld (Foster 2008: 168). However this was \nsomething of an elitist exception. The dominant style was Victorian gardenesque, which \nwas calculated to look distinct from natural growth through the use of exotic plants. In \npoorer suburbs of Cape Town, neat cultivation of gardens served as a symbol \u201cof \nsuccessful whiteness\u201d (Teppo 2004, 147). As suburbanization accelerated, the veld was \nleveled and replaced with bungalow houses surrounded by lawns, nonnative trees and \nglobal horticultural gardening plants such as azaleas, hydrangeas and roses.2 Gardens \nprimarily served outdoor lifestyles. As a gardening manual (circa 1980), listing almost \nentirely exotic plants, insisted that  \n \nLandscaping, once considered a luxury of the wealthy, is a necessity today. The \nincreased pace of living has resulted in a need to \u201cget away from it all\u201d \u2013 and what \nbetter place to do it than your own back yard. Today \u2026 gardens are becoming \nextensions of the home \u2026 Patio and barbecue areas are virtually outdoor \nlivingrooms. Because of our wonderful climate and love of the great outdoors, \nSouth Africans spend more time in the garden than practically any other nation on \nearth. (Kirsten no date, 11).  \n \nIn different ways, therefore, cultivated gardens and unimproved rural landscapes offered \nescapes from urban life.  \n \nIn recent decades, convergence of these ideals has come in the form of a resurgent \nindigenous gardening style. Enthusiasts have developed varying degrees of technical \nexpertise on plant identification and propagation. Field guides to local flora doubled as \nreferences books for gardeners. Elsa Pooley\u2019s guides won many over by pointing out that \n 12 \nthere are 750 tree species indigenous to the Eastern Region of Southern Africa, which is \n11 times greater than the whole of Europe (Pooley 1993, 9), and that \u201cSA has over 23 000 \nplants, the richest temperate flora of an area of comparable size in the world. With more \nthan 16 500 endemics, it is the largest flora in Africa\u201d (Pooley 1998, 16). Local \nnewspapers have carried columns promoting the indigenous plant of the week. \nWorkshops have been held in order to share knowledge of indigenous gardening. \nParticular success in the western area of Durban was achieved with an annual open \ngarden weekend in which five show gardens were opened up to the public, receiving up \nto 2000 visitors. While some of these show gardens demonstrate the potential for using \nindigenous plants with conventional gardening aesthetics, some departed more sharply \nfrom the convention. The African bushveld, was now being cultivated in suburban \ngardens. Plant stock was distinctive, with flat topped trees such as acacias and albizias, \nalong with succulent plants like aloes and euphorbias, acting as iconic \u201cAfrican\u201d plants. \nLawns were rolled back in order to create bird and insect-friendly \u201cbush clumps.\u201d Areas \nof thigh-high wild grasses were encouraged and weathered sandstone rocks, gravels, and \ndead wood used as accessories in order to achieve a striking African look. Indigenous \ngardening became a form of conspicuous consumption amongst the fashion conscious. \nSuburbanites who were ecologically inclined and sufficiently well resourced \ncommissioned landscapers to convert their gardens. In response, a thriving landscaping \nindustry emerged and innovative techniques developed. Grown trees were transplanted in \norder to give the garden an established appearance. Nurseries that specialised in \nindigenous plants emerged and garden centers began offering a larger array of indigenous \nplants. \n \nUnderpinning the shift to indigenous planting was a fear that exotic plants and animals \nconstituted a threat to delicate local ecologies (Comaroff and Comaroff 2001). Farmlands \nand the bush were being invaded by exotic weeds that had either been deliberately \nintroduced by gardeners or plantations, or had taken hold through the unintentional \nimportation of seed. Nature reserves and game reserves, which were supposed to \nresemble the landscape prior to human transformation, were now being spoiled by \nrunaway plants. Thirsty Australian eucalyptus or gum trees could consume large amounts \n 13 \nof water a day, and rivers were drying up. When fires moved into a stand of exotic plants, \nthey burned much hotter than the natural veld fires and therefore destroyed the soil and \nkilled seeds. The need for vigilant weeding has resulted in government public works \nprograms to clear \u201calien invasives.\u201d These publicly played out anxieties rapidly shifted \nthe definition of good plants to those that were from here, as against bad plants from \nelsewhere.  \n \nFor our research respondents, the indigenous gardening style registered as a recent \ndevelopment: \u201cindigenous plants has only really come into fashion I\u2019d say in the last ten \nyears. Everyone suddenly started talking about \u2018indigenous\u2019. Before that nobody cared \nreally. You just got what you fancied\u201d (Interview, Tracy, 2006; and Plate 1). Indigenous \ngardening has not displaced more conventional horticultural or cosmopolitan gardening. \nStaunchly conventional gardeners claim the right to produce the most attractive garden \nwith all available plant stock, regardless of origin. As in other contexts (Longhurst 2001), \nindigenous and exotic gardeners in South Africa have clashed on the issue. Conventional \nhorticultural gardeners think of indigenous plants as weedy, thorny and colorless. \nIndigenous gardeners contemptuously describe roses as \u201cicing sugar\u201d, and exotic \ngardeners as vectors of weeds. Yet the definition of \u201cindigenous\u201d is itself vague. Some \nindigenous gardeners draw their stock anywhere from the Southern African region and \nothers confine themselves to extremely local plant distributions, anxious that plants from \njust 500 kilometers away could become weeds in areas where they were previously not \npresent. The simple conceptual binary of indigenous\/exotic does not accord with a loose \nunderstanding of area of origin in practice (see Woods and Moriarty 2001).  \n \n \n[INSERT Plate 1] Plate 1: Suburbs and Older Gated Communities, such as Augusta, \nplanted with combinations of exotic and indigenous plants, with the former prominent.  \n \n 14 \nPeople and Plants \nThe turn to indigenous gardening, and the associated anxieties about exotic plants, take \non particular significance in the post-apartheid context. The political transition in South \nAfrica shifted moral gravity from things foreign and European to things native and \nAfrican. In one sense, therefore, it functions morally as a kind of politically correct \ngardening in which people try to behave in socially acceptable ways towards the \nenvironment. In more substantial forms, indigenous gardening aspires to reverse some of \nenormous environmental transformations which have occurred. Where 19th century \nEuropeans in South Africa took the success of exotic tree species as a Darwinist \nvalidation of their own success over other people (Grove 1989), conservationists aspired \nto a more harmonious and less dominating relationship with nature. Some also hoped that \nan appreciation of the local environment would play a positive role in social progress in \nSouth Africa. In the foreword to a popular field guide (Gibson 1975), Adolf Bayer, \nProfessor of Botany, stated that  \n \nThe intrinsic natural beauty of our veld is one of nature\u2019s most wonderful gifts. \nHelping people to recognise, to understand and to appreciate this gift \u2026 is one \nway of fostering a feeling of intensive love for our country, a feeling which could \nbecome a powerful solvent of most of our present social and racial difficulties and \ndissensions. (Gibson 1975) \n \nRecent books such as Medicinal Plants of South Africa (Van Wyk, Van Oudshoorn and \nGericke 1997) and People\u2019s Plants (van Wyk and Gericke 2000) suggest that an interest \nin plants may also provoke an interest in various kinds of people\u2019s relationships to those \nplants.  \n \nHowever, support for the conservation of biodiversity does not necessarily translate into \nconcerns about broader social justice. Cock (2006) suggests that the environmental \nmovement in South Africa is fragmented, with mainly white middle class \nconservationists concentrating on apolitical \u201cgreen\u201d issues of biodiversity and sustainable \ndevelopment, and mainly black poorer activists mobilising around \u201cbrown\u201d \n 15 \nenvironmental justice issues such as pollution and water provision. Moreover, some \nconservationists are politically and socially conservative people who feel alienated by the \ntransition. Where faith in the democratically elected political elite and those who elected \nthem is low, ecological patriotism arguably substitutes for nationalism as a mechanism \nfor achieving an attachment to place and claims to autochthony (Geschiere and \nNyamnjoh 2000; Ballard 2005; Head and Muir 2006; Foster 2008). The post-apartheid \ngovernment itself and the needs of large numbers of the urbanized poor black population \nare cast as a threat to the environment. A speaker at a seminar to promote indigenous \ngardening in 1999 opened her presentation by arguing that it was necessary to take action \nto conserve the environment with indigenous gardening because \u201cWe cannot rely on \nAIDS to solve all our problems.\u201d This Malthusian sentiment evoked the apartheid-era \nnotion that environmental problems are caused by black population growth (for further \nexamples see Ballard 2004b, 82).  \n \nConservationists frequently express the concern that the post-apartheid government \nplaces development ahead of the environment. In a contribution to an email discussion \ngroup a botanical enthusiast expressed his dismay at the environmental destruction taking \nplace as a result of a low cost housing development west of Durban: \u201cApart from being \nanother example of redistribution of capital from those who create it, to those who merely \nconsume it, this is also a fine example of bad spatial development and ratepayer\/taxpayer \nfunded trashing of a rich natural area\u201d (Posting to Plantchat discussion group. 2001\/02\/01 \n\u201cState-sponsored environmental thuggery inland of Durban\u201d). The black middle class is \nalso seen to fall short environmentally. An indigenous landscaper proposed that black \nupwardly mobile people are \u201caspiring to what we [white indigenous gardeners] are trying \nto get away from. They\u2019re aspiring to the exotic, the typical landscapes that they have \nbeen \u2026 shown for the last 20 or 40 years \u2026 they\u2019re not interested in indigenous at all\u201d \n(Interview, indigenous landscaper, 1997).  \n \n 16 \nPart B: Gated nature \nSouth African suburban housing has for many decades been diversifying away from the \nideal of detached houses to include cluster accommodation. Political, economic, and \nsocial transformations following the advent democracy in 1994 have given new impetus \nto this trend. Many residents of open suburbs have responded to urban changes such as \ncrime and diversity by seeking out more secure and controlled neighbourhoods. Average \nprices of middle and luxury housing increased by 295 percent nationally between 2000 \nand 2007 as a result of sustained economic growth, personal tax relief, the easy \navailability of mortgages, and the reduction of lending rates (Du Toit 2007). This \nunprecedented purchasing power and demand opened up major opportunities for owners \nof land within commuting distance of cities. Not only could they realise good value but in \ndoing so they could avoid problems such as land claims, land invasions, and unreliable \nagricultural commodity prices. The result has been 1 435 walled estates nationally \nappealing to a variety of market segments (Watt and Loos 2007, Lemanski, Landman and \nDurington 2008) and ranging in size from just a few homes to new towns of thousands of \nunits. Nature features prominently in many of these developments.   \n \nTo illustrate, Judy and Brian had been the owners and sole occupiers of 32 acres of land \nwest of Durban since the early 1980s. The land was zoned for agricultural use and had a \nlarge stand of Eucalyptus. They set about transforming the land as a result of their love of \nnature:  \n \nWe go away to game reserves quite a lot. When we get to a game reserve, we \nmight sit in a place that\u2019s far more humble than our home and say \u201cisn\u2019t this \nabsolutely amazing?\u201d And what we are looking at is indigenous trees, natural \ngrasslands and it\u2019s all so harmonious that we actually love it, so we love all the \nexperiences we\u2019ve had in the bush. (Interview, Judy, 2006) \n \nGiven their concern that \u201cinvasives are taking over our natural vegetation\u201d they removed \nthe Eucalyptus and planted \u201cthousands\u201d of indigenous trees. The result, they said, was \nthat \u201cour dam filled up ... And we\u2019ve actually seen what all of this has done in our lives. \n 17 \nIn April you see butterflies all over this garden. We see trees, the birds coming into this \ngarden. It is so rewarding\u201d (Interview, Judy, 2006). \n \nAfter the political transition Judy and Brian felt increasingly \u201cvulnerable\u201d because the \ngovernment had introduced legislation to make evictions difficult. To preempt the \npossibility of squatters moving on to the land, they resolved to surround themselves with \na community of their choosing. They were granted permission to rezone from agricultural \nto residential land use. They set up infrastructure and in 2001 put just under 40 plots up \nfor sale. Individual buyers would build their own homes using specified standards and \nconforming to a \u201cNatal veranda\u201d style with green roofs and red face brick. A low density \nlayout accommodated large plots of 2000 square meters and a 12 acre conservation area \nwith \u201cindigenous grassland, trees and bushes\u201d. Gardens would also be indigenous. An \nenvironmental consultant drew up a 40 page environment management plan including \nplant lists, and this was included in the sale agreement. \n \n \n[INSERT Plate 2] \nPlate 2: Some communities have landscaped with indigenous plants, in this case while \nmaintaining the internal organization of the village.  \n \n \nAlongside Judy and Brian\u2019s small scale neighborhood on their restored land, nature has \nbeen central to much larger and more commercial development projects (Plate 2). A \nlandscape architect explained that developers are often opting for indigenous landscaping \neven though this is more expensive to meet market demand.  \n \n\u2026people are becoming more and more indigenous conscious, that\u2019s also a good \nselling mechanism because indigenous sells \u2026 the word \u201cindigenous\u201d has \nbecome a marketing tool. And it sells. It\u2019s become fashionable, to keep up with \nthe Jonses, saying \u201cI live in an indigenous [development]\u201d... It\u2019s probably only \n 18 \npicked up in the past 5 or 6 years where the whole \u2026 indigenous movement has \npicked up. (Interview, Landscape architect, 2008) \n \nAn eco-estate developer explained that \u201c[t]his is a particular lifestyle: it\u2019s not for \neveryone, but for people who enjoy the outdoors and being close to nature\u201d (Koblitz \n2006). Promotions for estates almost invariably describe enticing detail the possibilities \nfor living with nature:  \n \nSimbithi Eco-Estate has been planned with one thing in mind, to give you the \nopportunity to reconnect with nature and embrace a lifestyle in harmony with \nyour natural environment. Away from the chaos of the concrete jungle \u2026 is a \nnatural, coastal paradise with dense, indigenous riverine vegetation, lush valley \nwetlands, undulating hills and distant, breathtaking vistas. It is a way of \npreserving nature, as much as it is a way of preserving a lifestyle. (Elan Group, no \ndate) \n \nAnother estate similarly offers \u201can uninhibited reconnection to nature that has been lost \nthrough excessive urbanisation\u201d (Sunday Tribune 2008b). Wildlife plays a \ncomplimentary role in creating a sense of nature. Phezulu Game estate, for example, \nprohibits pets and fencing around individual houses as \u201c[w]e already have Giraffe, Zebra, \nWildebeest, Impala, Blesbok, a variety of Duiker, Bush Buck, bush pig and \napproximately 160 species of birds\u201d (Phezulu Game Estate, no date; Plate 3).3 For jaded \nsuburbanites, a move to a Simbithi eco-estate offers the thrill of the frontier:  \n \nA women was sitting on her verandah ... and this leopard walked past. And so she \ncalled the security guy and he saw it \u2026 But nobody else has ever seen it. \u2026 And \nthen they are saying that there was a carcass of a buck found \u2026 and they got the \nvet and all the wildlife fundis [experts] in to check it out and they say it definitely \nis a leopard, the spoor was a leopard spoor. \u2026 We\u2019re all waiting, we\u2019re all \nlooking now. Every time we drive around here we\u2019re looking for the leopard \n(Interview, Tracy, 2006)  \n 19 \n \nThe excitement of encountering wildlife within the community is carefully arranged by \ndevelopers. Banks of condominium units overlook watering holes where animals come to \ndrink in the evening, bringing a sense of the \u201cgame reserve\u201d into the development, the \nanimals complimenting the \u201csundowner\u201d cocktail (Plate 4). Moving a few hundred \nmeters toward the main clubhouse and restaurant a wetland sanctuary offers another \nopportunity for nature watching, again combined with the possibility of an evening drink \nor party gathering (Plate 5).  \n \n[INSERT Plates 3, 4 & 5] \nPlate 3: Phezulu incorporates a tribal authority area and promotes itself as a game estate. \nBut note a Eucalyptus to the far right. \nPlate 4: Units in Simbithi are landscaped to overlook a watering hole. Note the \nindigenous grasses and gardener to foreground. \nPlate 5: Simbithi includes a bird watching hide overlooking wetland \n \nThree mechanisms are used to produce indigenous landscapes. The first is to remove \nplantations of sugarcane, eucalyptus, or pine and to landscape the area with indigenous \nplants. These are often common areas such as golf courses, equestrian facilities, gateways \nand verges. The second is to encourage or insist on the use of indigenous plants in \nindividual gardens within the development. As we shall see below, this has had a mixed \nreception amongst residents. The third is to claim previously uncultivated land as an \nindigenous forest, bushveld, or grassland. Generally such patches of land were not \ncultivated as they were too steep or otherwise unsuitable. Having been of little value in \nagriculture they now become prized assets in residential developments. Often, being \nsteep, they are not used for residential areas but function in effect as internal public \nspaces with walking trails. However in some particularly elite coastal developments, \nhouses are inserted into forests with the actual shape of structures fitting around large \nMilkwood trees.  \n \n 20 \nThe landscapes that emerge are extremely diverse, resulting not only from the diversity of \necologies but also a somewhat elastic application of the indigenous brand. Residual \ncoastal forest adjacent to the beach has been used to great effect so as to achieve a \nforested residential environment. However, aside from the coastal hills and steep or \nriverine areas, much of the region would naturally have been grassland or more open \nbushveld. Some estates have attempted to adhere faithfully to the plant range that would \nhave been found on a site prior to cultivation. However, not all indigenous developments, \nstrive for an authentic reproduction or preservation of local ecologies. A development of \n680 homes for the \u201cactive over 50s\u201d aimed to create a botanic garden with indigenous \nplants. Landscapers were commissioned to create a waterway running between the houses \nwhich lead to an open wetland complete with bird hide. There are 30 ponds each of which \nhas a theme such as the \u201cthe birds of a feather pond, where plant species create a safe \nhaven for birds and waterfowl\u201d and \u201cthe protea pond, surrounded by the national heritage \nflower\u201d (Richards 2006). The result is scenes that reference landscapes found around the \ncountry but do not claim endemic authenticity. Finally, some estates who adhere to \nindigenous planting policies have entirely dispensed with the intention of creating \nAfrican wilderness. Cotswold Down, which has more than 800 units on a 300 hectare \nsite, is aiming for an English landscape. Their landscape guidelines explain that:  \n  \nOur philosophy for Cotswold Down will be to reflect what is historically \ncharacteristic to the Cotswold Country-side region in the United Kingdom. We \nwill however, be using a predominantly indigenous plant palette to adapt this \ncharacter to South Africa. (Uys and White 2006) \n \nDevelopers are therefore harnessing the indigenous brand to achieve a variety of different \nkinds of landscapes, ranging from approximations of what the land might have looked \nlike before human alteration, to the production of scenes that replicate distant places.  \n \n 21 \nEthical estates \nNot only do gated communities offer a mechanism for nature lovers to access plants and \nanimals, but they are told that their purchase of a home in a community will help \nrehabilitate and preserve the environment. Promotional material for one estate explained \nthat the land owner \u201cwatched the decline of the Valley of a Thousand Hills [a peri urban \narea west of Durban] as the invasion of the alien vegetation swept through it. He \u2026 \ndevised a plan to save the valley. He knew that there were lots of families who would \nlove to preserve the Valley whilst having their own secure, private game reserve.\u201d \n(Phezulu Game Estate, no date). Another estate claims the \u201cconversion of an ecological \ndesert (previously cane lands) into an abundant coastal climax grassland community, \ninterspersed with coastal forest environmental corridors, lakes and wetlands to attract as \nmuch biotic diversity that the carrying capacity of the site can support\u201d (Simbithi, no \ndate). In a context of limited public funds for nature conservation and increasing pressure \nfrom urban sprawl, developers boast that by setting aside land they are able to protect \nindigenous coastal forest \u201cad infinitum\u201d (Koblitz 2006). Buying property in an \nindigenously landscaped estate is thus a form of ethical consumption. Estates commit to a \ntriple bottom line approach, \u201cfocusing equally on profit, people and the planet\u201d and \ndelivering \u201cmore overall value with less environmental impact\u201d (Hooper 2008). Golf \ncourse designers claim to \u201clisten to the land\u201d and insist that \u201cin many cases, developers \nactually improve the environment and uplift the area\u201d (Nevill 2004). In a few cases, fair \ntrade trademarks and 14001 certification are used to endorse environmentalist credentials \n(Nevill 2004; Hooper 2008).  \n \nThis search for credibility is in part a response to an image problem experienced by \nproperty development. Gated communities have been criticized by many, including the \nformer state president, Thabo Mbeki, for reinforcing social inequality (Mbeki 2005). The \nre-branding of gated communities was therefore important to their greater social \ncredibility. Through the use of indigenous plants, golf courses and horse paddocks make \nthe transition from elite indulgence to virtuous landscapes. Yet claims of \nenvironmentalism have themselves been challenged. An environmentalist lodged a \ncomplaint against the use of the word \u201ceco-estate\u201d with the advertising standards \n 22 \nauthority (Interview, Harold Witt, 2008). He argued that marketing enormous energy-\nhungry houses built to accommodate long distance highway commuters constituted false \nadvertising. Estates require infrastructure such as sewerage processing which local \ngovernment is not always able or willing to provide. Golf courses themselves are \nnotoriously thirsty, require chemicals, and depend on fairways and greens of exotic grass \ntypes.4 Furthermore, one of the defining features of an eco-estate is said to be very low \nhousing density (Koblitz 2006). At one such estate, building coverage can only be only \n35 percent of each plot. For residents at least this creates an enjoyable living environment \nas one explains: \n  \nthe plots are nice and big and spaced out, and they\u2019ve left a lot of areas open for \nour animals, which is lovely, so that appealed to me. I wouldn\u2019t want to live ... [in \nestates where you have huge houses on small pieces of land] I like to have bigger \nplots and more spaced out and leave little bits in between of natural vegetation. \n(Interview, Tracy, 2006).  \n \nThis certainly succeeds in surrounding the few residents and visitors able to access the \nestate in more greenery than in a city. The production of low density natural living \nenvironments for elites gets conflated, therefore, with service to the environment (cf. \nDuncan and Duncan 2004, 140). While there is little doubt that some developments have \nmade substantial investment in environmental \u201cbest practice,\u201d many have also sought to \nevade such investment. There is resistance in others to excessively close regulation by the \nstate (Koblitz 2006), and in one spectacular case the bribery of a provincial premier to \noverlook environmental concerns (Nevill 2004).  \n \nContesting indigenous landscapes \nMarketing of eco-estates appeals to those who treat nature as a hobby or a passion. Some \nof the residents we spoke to were indeed persuaded to buy in as a result. Anna said that \n\u201cthey are starting a bird club here and we are going to join, and I\u2019ll get back into my \nbirding and all the things I enjoy\u201d (Interview, 2006). To varying degrees, then, eco-\n 23 \nestates are appealing to those who would enjoy nature reserves and game reserves. \nIndigenous gardening is seen as a mechanism to \u201cbring the bird life and the wildlife \nback\u201d (Interview, Mary, 2006). In addition, indigenous landscaping had the benefit of \nfitting into residents search for country landscapes: \u201cit\u2019s not too starched with these \nformal kind of plantings which I don\u2019t like. I like the happy relaxation of the indigenous \nplanting\u201d (Interview, Anna, 2006). Similarly, Mary said \u201cI don\u2019t like the prissy little \ngardens, that look, you know, terribly neatly edged\u201d (Interview, Mary, 2006). \n \nWhile the indigenous pitch has, therefore, worked to a degree, there is not always an easy \ntransmission of purist ideas from environmentalists to a broader middle class housing \nmarket. In open suburbia the use of autonomous domestic spaces are largely determined \nby individuals. Although there are municipal by-laws, these largely do not refer to \nquestions of taste. However private residential estates aspire to be collective domestic \nendeavors which introduce much greater potential to regulate and police the architectural \nand landscaping choices of residents. Some of the most up-market developments forbid \nthe planting of any exotic plants. However the stipulations of developers and trustees are \nnot always well received by class-empowered and individualistic residents who until now \nhave not been dictated to in this way.  \n \nAssuming that purchasers of houses on the new estate would agree with this method of \ngardening, the developers are mortified that some seek more freedom to garden with \nexotic plants. Returning to the case of Bruce and Judy\u2019s development, both the \ndevelopers and other residents reported tensions on the issue of indigenous purism.  \n \nWe\u2019ve got some people who have bought into it, but by and large, many people \ndon\u2019t actually understand indigenous ... In fact it\u2019s a very contentious thing, \nincredibly. I mean there are people that we don\u2019t get on well with at all. They\u2019ve \nbought and now they want to continue planting whatever they want to, and we\u2019ve \nsaid, \u2018no you can\u2019t \u2026 We want it to remain fully indigenous\u2019 and there are people \nwho don\u2019t see it that way \u2026 it\u2019s lack of understanding, knowledge, education in \nterms of indigenous planting \u2026 and some lack of integrity \u2026, the lady up at the \n 24 \ntop there who likes miniature [exotic] conifers so she\u2019s got 30 or 40 miniature \nconifers which we say are not plants that we want you to put on the property. \u2026 \nThey want standard roses (Interview, Bruce and Judy, 2006) \n \nFor their part, the new neighbors who are introducing exotic plants show considerable \nunderstanding of the value of indigenous. However they would like some flexibility to \ndraw from the familiar palette of gardening plants which have been part of their \ngardening practice for much longer than the more restrictive current fashion:  \n \nMargy: But the trend now is to indigenous planting, because it saves water and as \nyou know, the country is becoming very conscious of the lack of water. And I \nthink the reason for the indigenous, and it\u2019s also good for birds, and wildlife, not \nthat ordinary gardens don\u2019t attract birds and bees, but I think indigenous \nplanting goes hand in glove with a normal garden as well, because you can mix \nand match.  \nRichard: But you like to have a bit of freedom as well? \nMargy: Well this is it. What we\u2019ve found here is that as time has progressed, the \nrestriction on the indigenous has got to a stranglehold, where people now are \njust putting their backs up. You know what it\u2019s like when a gun is held to your \nhead, \u2026 In many ways it\u2019s a fashionable thing having indigenous, and fashions \nchange, so you cannot lay down rigid rules that you can expect to last twenty or \nthirty years, because fashions will change again. (Interview, Margy, 2006) \n \nThe developers recognize with disappointment that their creation of a residential estate \nhas brought people into their lives who \u201cdon\u2019t follow the vision\u201d (Interview, Bruce, \n2006).  \n \nSome less personally invested developers in other estates have been more willing to turn \na blind eye to transgressions. Having sold their plots using the indigenous brand, it was \nimmaterial to them whether individuals adhered to this norm. A resident of one such \ndevelopment of 120 homes observed:  \n 25 \n \nWhen we first started \u2026 they said \u2018we encourage indigenous gardening\u2019, which is \nthe big thing here these days, that you try and plant indigenous. But it wasn\u2019t \nenforced like Zimbali for example where they have to plant only plants that would \nhave naturally grown there in the old days. So quite a few people have got fairly \nindigenous gardens but there are quite a lot that have been landscaped totally \nwithout a single indigenous plant in them. \u2026 With the style of the house, that\u2019s \nnot the sort of garden they wanted. (Interview, Pam, 2006) \n \nOther residents in the same community explained their dislike of the indigenous style and \nother difficulties they experienced with the pressure for conservation. They said that a \nshow house within the development \u201chad an indigenous garden and it looked more like a \nweed field. It wasn\u2019t nice \u2026 They gave you a list of plants [and] they recommended you \nplant \u2026 indigenous, \u2026 and we said \u2018no\u2019 \u2026 we wanted a bit of color. So we got a bit of \neverything. We\u2019ve got both\u201d (Interview, Liz, 2006).  \n \nTherefore, while indigenous gardening has become a widespread claim in new property \ndevelopments, it does not have universal appeal. Landscape consultants shrewdly build in \na compromise from the outset, recognizing the need to keep as many people happy as \npossible. For example they stipulate the use of 70 percent indigenous plants, but allow 30 \npercent non-invasive exotics (Uys and White 2006). One developer, who\u2019s estate \npredated the trend toward indigenous gardens, felt that \u201cthe greeny\u2019s take it too far. \u2026 \nthere are so many beautiful trees in this country that are not indigenous. \u2026 And one \nhopes of course that they are not going to destroy [them]. There are some lovely trees \nhere which along the outside road, just going down to the main gates. They\u2019re not going \nto have those taken down.\u201d5 (Interview, Developer, 2006) \n \nConclusion: protecting endangered species \nThis article has explored a case in which new representational and material engagements \nwith domestic natures helps to explain elite engagements with nature, society and itself in \n 26 \nthe post-apartheid context. The contemporary elite gated communities in South Africa \noffer to insert suburbanites into indigenous natural spaces. We have attempted to suggest \nthat this appeals to a conservationist ethic which valorizes \u201coriginal\u201d landscapes. \nDomesticated plants and animals are jettisoned in favor of a supposedly more authentic \nlocal nature. The focus on the production of and relationship with domestic natures \npresumes that environmental ethic is demonstrated by an intimate relationship with \nnature. Yet this passionate commitment to nature largely ignores the environmental and \nsocial costs of middle class accumulation and consumption (cf. Hinchcliffe 1997). In \nmore than one way, these developments naturalise inequality and exclusion.  \n \nIn environmental terms, there is no doubt that the conversion from plantations to a more \ndiverse mix of indigenous plants and offers greater prospect for rich functioning eco-\nsystems. However, this is not done for the sake of the environment alone but also \nconstitutes an investment in nature as a step in its commodification. The execution of \nlandscape designs through civil engineering and mass planting means these \u201cnatural\u201d \nspaces are created through intense intervention, or what Harvey calls \u201cthe market \nprovision of constructed authenticity\u201d (1993, 12). Natural does not mean, for consumers \nof these landscapes, that nature is left to its own devices but rather that it is channeled in \nthe direction of a pre-industrial ideal. The outcome is no less a cultural artifact, but is one \nwhich now seeks more explicitly to produce domestic wilderness. With nature too \ntransformed by past land use and alien invasives to restore itself, creative agency is \nattributed to developers and managers who are required to restore and defend nature. As \nWilliams reminds us,  \n \nThere is more similarity than we usually recognise between the industrial \nentrepreneur and the landscape gardener, each altering nature to a consumable \nform: and the client or beneficiary of the landscaper, who in turn has a view or a \nprospect to use, is often only at the lucky end of a common process, able to \nconsume because others have produced in a leisure that follows from quite precise \nwork. (Williams 2005, 81) \n \n 27 \nThe inclusion of wild nature in domestic life is something of a rupture with past styles of \ngardening. For descendants of European immigrants, it demonstrates a strong \ncommitment to the local, and a rejection of the practice of reproducing generic \nlandscapes or landscapes explicitly from elsewhere. This passion for nature is not \nintrinsically conservative and offers a moment of potential openness to a more general re-\nvaluation of the local including kinds of people previously considered inferior. However \nits uptake in eco-estates suggests the distillation of certain liked elements of the local to \nthe exclusion of those things less liked in the post-apartheid milieu. By rewinding the \nlandscape in this way, developers are, in effect, enticing buyers to (re)colonize terra \nnullius (cf. Palmer 2004; Waitt, Gill and Head 2009), or to return to the garden of Eden \n(cf. Till 2001). Wilderness itself functions as the heritage hook for creating a sense of \nplace.  \n \nThe jurisdiction of the eco-estate performs a metaphoric function in this regard. Where \ngame reserves were developed as spaces in which nature would be protected and enjoyed \nby visitors from modern cities, developers have gone one step further by creating pseudo \nnature reserves and inviting elites to join nature behind the protective fences. Weeding \nreinforces the importance of the perimeter fence and the likely response to its \ntransgression by the wrong plants, people and behaviors (cf. Bauman 1993; Cresswell \n1997). These estates assure freedom from both botanical and human \u201cinvasives\u201d. Eco-\nestates produce landscapes, therefore, which claim to protect two different sets of \nvulnerable assets. Common cause is struck between people who feel threatened by crime \nand uncontrolled urban mixing, and sensitive ecologies under threat from weeds, \nagriculture, urbanisation, and overpopulation.  \n \nThe study suggests that indigenous gardening might function, as any landscape, in the \n\u201creproduction of a class or status group\u201d (Duncan 1992, 40). A certain kind of ethical and \nnature loving person is able to invest in the preservation of nature and display this \ncompassion to others. What the case shows, however, is that there is little consensus \nwithin this single \u201cstatus group\u201d as to whether a purist indigenous landscape is the \ndesirable material or symbolic environment. Gardeners who learned to garden with a \n 28 \nvariety of global horticultural plants are reluctant to abandon these entirely, although they \nrecognise the ecological virtues of indigenous plants and the possible dangers of runaway \nweeds. This divergence in gardening aesthetic can be unsettling to people who attempted \nto create utopian communities on the assumption of shared values, but are now barely on \nspeaking terms. Some attempts to build private communities of like minded people in \nresponse to a threatening post-apartheid society have not always provided the comfort of \nhome so anticipated. In many other cases, developers creatively traverse these categories \nto accommodate seemingly contradictory ways of feeling at home.  \n \n 29 \nReferences \nAnderson, K. 1997.

As often, the presence of indigenous wildlife may go unnoticed by most. In a Nevada \nsuburban community, Guterson (1992) recounts how a nine year old informant rejoiced in the presence of \nlizards, rattlers, chipmunks, lions, black widow spiders and scorpions in the most bland urban environment \npossible. \n2 Indigenous plants were present in many gardens as they contributed well to the production of a landscaped \nhorticultural garden. Individual species of indigenous plants such as agapanthas, zantedeshia (arum lily), \ngladoli, geraniums, gerberas, strelitzia (bird of paradise flower) were recognized as gardening plants the \nworld over. Other plants such as cycads, clivias and orchids were also prized and sometimes taken from the \nwild. Others still may simply have been \u2018planted\u2019 there by birds or other non human means and become \nincorporated into the garden. Distinctively local trees such as Acacias and Albizia and plants such as aloes \ncertainly featured in many gardens alongside imports, signifying a rather complex combination of \ninternational and local references in gardening. However, only a fraction of local species entered the \ngardening pallet and most would have been weeded out. \n3 Phezulu estate has leased 300 of its 630 hectare estate from a tribal authority in order to secure a large \narea of undeveloped land as a nature reserve (Interview, Phezulu staff, 2006). This entailed a process of \nmoving a Zulu family out of the reserve and providing him with a new house and access to water and \nelectricity which they did not have before. The surrounding Zulu community will have access to the land.  \n4 A civil society group called \u2018guardians of the garden route\u2019 has organised in the southern Cape to oppose \nrapid enclosure of land and monopolisation of water resources by elite groups in new developments (Cape \nArgus 2005)  \n5 There have been various panics, including a particularly effective April Fool\u2019s joke, that conservationists \nare going to succeed in removing all jacarandas whose blue flowers define the spring landscapes of towns \nsuch as Pretoria and Pietermaritzburg. In fact the official policy is to remove those that have escaped from \ncontrolled settings into the wild (Independent Online 2001, and Montgomery 2001).  \n"}
