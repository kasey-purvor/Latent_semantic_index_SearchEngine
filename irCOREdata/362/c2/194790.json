We present the results of global, three-\ndimensional, smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of self-gravitating accretion discs,\nin which the disc is cooled using a simple parametrization for the cooling function.

We find that, as long as the disc mass is smaller than\n0.25M\u0002 and the aspect ratio H\/R \u0001 0.1, transport is determined locally, thus allowing for a\nviscous treatment of the disc evolution.\nKey words: accretion, accretion discs \u2013 gravitation \u2013 instabilities \u2013 stars: formation \u2013 galaxies:\nactive.\n1 I N T RO D U C T I O N\nOne of the basic unknowns of accretion disc theory is the physical\nmechanism ultimately responsible for angular momentum transport\nand energy dissipation in the disc. It is well known that classical hy-\ndrodynamical viscosity is not sufficient to provide accretion at the\nrates inferred from the observations in almost every astrophysical\ncontext where accretion discs play a role. The usual way to over-\ncome this difficulty is to assume that transport is dominated by some\n\u2018anomalous\u2019 viscous phenomenon, possibly related to collective in-\nstabilities in the disc, and to give some ad hoc parametrizations for\nthe viscosity. The most widely used of such parametrizations is the\nso-called \u03b1-prescription (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973, see Section 2).\nIt has been recently recognized that accretion discs threaded by a\nweak magnetic field are subject to magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)\ninstabilities (see Balbus & Hawley 1998, and references therein),\nwhich can induce turbulence in the disc, thereby being able to trans-\nport angular momentum and to promote the accretion process. How-\never, in many astrophysically interesting cases, such as the outer re-\ngions of protostellar discs, the ionization level is expected to be low,\nreducing significantly the effects of magnetic fields in determining\nthe dynamics of the disc, at least over limited radial ranges (Gammie\n1996). A possible alternative source of transport in cold discs is pro-\nvided by gravitational instabilities (Lin & Pringle 1987; Laughlin &\nBodenheimer 1994; Armitage, Livio & Pringle 2001). Moreover, in\nenvironments where the disc mass is a significant fraction of the cen-\n\u0002E-mail: giuseppe@ast.cam.ac.uk\ntral object mass, such as during the assembly of protostellar discs,\nit is inevitable that disc self-gravity will play a role.\nThe axisymmetric stability of a thin disc with respect to its own\nself-gravity is determined by the parameter Q (Toomre 1964), de-\nfined as\nQ = cs\u03ba\n\u03c0G\u0006\n, (1)\nwhere cs is the effective thermal speed of the disc, \u0006 is the surface\ndensity and \u03ba is the epicyclic frequency (which, for a Keplerian\ndisc, is equal to the angular velocity \b). The disc is unstable if Q is\nsmaller than a threshold value \u00afQ \u2248 1. It has been long recognized,\nespecially in the context of galactic dynamics (Hohl 1971; Bertin\n& Romeo 1988), that the development of gravitational instabilities\nwould lead to a self-regulation process: if the disc is initially cold, in\nthe sense that Q < \u00afQ, then gravitational instabilities would heat it\nup on the fast dynamical time-scale, bringing it toward stability; on\nthe other hand, if the disc is hot enough to begin with, then radiative\ncooling is going to bring the value of Q down toward an unstable\nconfiguration. As a result of the presence of these two competing\nmechanisms, the \u2018switch\u2019 associated with the onset of gravitational\ninstabilities will act as a thermostat for the disc, which is therefore\nexpected to be always close to marginal stability. A similar approach\nhas been also suggested in the case of accretion discs (Paczyn\u00b4ski\n1978; Bertin 1997).\nFrom the observational point of view, there are already some clues\nthat the disc self-gravity can be important both in the context of\nprotostellar discs and in accretion discs around supermassive black\nholes in active galactic nuclei (AGN). However, a detailed com-\nparison with observations is limited by the lack of detailed models\nC\u00a9 2004 RAS\n at :: on N\novem\nber 23, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nLocality of transport in self-gravitating discs 631\nof self-gravitating discs and by an incomplete understanding of the\nbasic physical processes involved.\nThe importance of the disc self-gravity in observations of proto-\nstellar discs was pointed out by Adams, Lada & Shu (1988), who\nrealized that a massive disc, with a flat rotation curve, could repro-\nduce the observed flat long-wavelength spectral energy distribution\n(SED) of many protostellar sources. However, in these early studies\nno detailed model of self-gravitating accretion discs was available,\nso that the required disc mass turned out to be unreasonably large.\nThese ideas were recently revisited by Lodato & Bertin (2001) in\nthe light of a self-consistent disc model (Bertin & Lodato 1999), and\nthey were able to model the observed SED of FU Orionis objects\n(a class of young stellar objects undergoing a phase of enhanced\naccretion), with a disc mass comparable to that of the central ob-\nject. This model assumes that the outer disc (beyond a few au from\nthe central star) is self-regulated. However, non-self-gravitating\n\u03b1-models of accretion discs would predict a rapidly declining radial\nprofile of Q, which would eventually become unphysically small in\nthe outer regions of the disc. In the case of FU Orionis discs, the disc\nis predicted to be marginally stable already at a distance of \u22481 au\nfrom the central star (Bell & Lin 1994). The arguments at the basis\nof the self-regulation mechanisms would suggest that in the outer\nregions of the disc an additional heating source is required in order to\nkeep the disc marginally stable. Lodato & Bertin (2001) argued that\nthe difficulty with \u03b1-models arises because these viscous models\nassume that energy dissipation is determined locally, whereas grav-\nitational instabilities would naturally act in a global way, leading to\na modification of the standard estimates of the viscous dissipation\npower.\nAnalogous considerations also hold in the context of AGN discs.\nHere, Lodato & Bertin (2003) have shown that the non-Keplerian ro-\ntation curve traced by water masers in the Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068\n(Greenhill et al. 1996; Greenhill & Gwinn 1997) can be reproduced\nby self-regulated disc models. Sirko & Goodman (2003), following\nthe same arguments of Lodato & Bertin (2001), have modelled the\nlong-wavelength SED of AGN discs, based on the requirement that\nQ \u2248 1. The latter authors also recognize the need for some addi-\ntional heating, but, contrary to Lodato & Bertin (2001), attribute it\nto some \u2018external\u2019 source, namely nuclear fusion in stars embedded\nin the disc (see also Collin & Zahn 1999).\nActually, the issue of locality of transport in self-gravitating ac-\ncretion discs still remains an open question. Lin & Pringle (1987)\nhave suggested that the transport induced by self-gravity could be\ndescribed within a viscous framework, and introduced a modified\n\u03b1-prescription, where \u03b1 \u223c Q\u22122. In this way, a self-regulated disc\nwould be characterized by a rather large effective viscosity, with\n\u03b1 \u2248 1. On the other hand, Balbus & Papaloizou (1999) have shown\nthat the energy equation for self-gravitating discs cannot be put in\nthe form of a diffusion equation, as required in a viscous scenario,\nand that the energy flux contains some extra terms, associated with\nglobal wave transport, that are \u2018anomalous\u2019 from the point of view\nof viscosity. Similar ideas had also been suggested by Shu et al.\n(1990).\nIn this context, numerical simulations play a central role. Laughlin\n& Bodenheimer (1994) have performed global, smoothed particle\nhydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of massive isothermal discs, con-\ncluding that the density evolution of the disc could be reproduced\nin terms of simple \u03b1-models. Laughlin & Ro`z\u02d9yczka (1996), using\ntwo-dimensional (2D) grid-based simulations, have shown that in\norder to reproduce the density evolution induced by gravitational\ninstabilities an \u03b1 coefficient dependent on radius was needed. How-\never, these simulations did not include a detailed treatment of the\nheating and cooling processes in the disc, which have been shown to\nplay a fundamental role in determining the outcome of the instability\n(Nelson et al. 2000; Pickett et al. 2000).\nGammie (2001) has performed local, shearing-sheet, zero-\nthickness simulations of self-gravitating discs, including a simple\ncooling term, and has concluded that a local description is adequate\nin such \u2018razor-thin\u2019 discs. However, Gammie\u2019s simulations are not\nappropriate to test global effects, because locality is set up from\nthe beginning, and they are only valid for infinitesimally thin discs,\nwhile the typical distance over which gravitational instabilities are\nexpected to travel scales with the disc thickness. Rice et al. (2003a,b)\nhave already shown, using global, three-dimensional (3D) simula-\ntions, how global effects can be important in the dynamics of self-\ngravitating discs, in relation to the related issue of the fragmentation\nof a massive disc.\nIn this paper we present the results of global, 3D, SPH simulations\nof massive, cooling, non-magnetized discs. Our main purpose is to\nquantitatively determine the dissipation power provided by gravita-\ntional instabilities and to compare the results with the expectations\nbased on a viscous theory of discs, in order to assess the extent\nto which the transport induced by gravitational instabilities can be\nregarded as a local process.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we summarize the\nbasic transport properties of viscous and of self-gravitating discs,\nintroducing the basic physical quantities involved. In Section 3 we\ndescribe the numerical set-up of our simulations. In Section 4 we\nshow the results of our computations. In Section 5 we discuss our\nresults in comparison with previous investigations and in relation\nto observed systems. In Section 6 we draw our conclusions. In\nAppendix A we discuss the more technical issue of transport induced\nby artificial viscosity in the numerical simulations presented.\n2 T R A N S P O RT I N AC C R E T I O N D I S C S\nIn this section we will summarize a few well-known results about\nthe dynamics of viscous and self-gravitating accretion discs, that are\ngoing to be essential in the description of our results. We will not go\ninto the full details of the derivation of the main results, for which\none can refer to standard reviews, such as that of Pringle (1981).\n2.1 Non-self-gravitating discs\nIn the analysis performed in this paper we will adopt the thin disc\napproximation, and will therefore deal with vertically integrated\nquantities. The equations of motion for an axisymmetric disc, in\ncylindrical coordinates, are the equation of continuity\n\u2202\u0006\n\u2202t\n+ 1\nR\n\u2202\n\u2202R\n(R\u0006u) = 0, (2)\nand the azimuthal component of Euler\u2019s equation (expressed in\nterms of angular momentum conservation)\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n(\u0006R2\b) + 1\nR\n\u2202\n\u2202R\n(\u0006R3\bu) = \u2212 1\nR\n\u2202\n\u2202R\n(\nR2TR\u03c6\n)\n, (3)\nwhere u is the radial velocity and T R\u03c6 is the relevant component of\nthe viscous stress tensor, integrated in the vertical direction. This\nlast term is the basic ingredient in the theory of accretion discs. As\nwe have already anticipated, standard hydrodynamical viscosity is\nnot sufficient to provide accretion at the required rates, and therefore\nT R\u03c6 is generally described by means of ad hoc prescriptions. The\n\u03b1-prescription (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973), based on simple\nC\u00a9 2004 RAS, MNRAS 351, 630\u2013642\n at :: on N\novem\nber 23, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n632 G. Lodato and W. K. M. Rice\narguments on the relevant physical scales of turbulent cells in the\ndiscs, assumes that T R\u03c6 is proportional to the disc pressure\nTR\u03c6 =\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223d ln \bd ln R\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u03b1\u0006c2s , (4)\nwhere the proportionality constant \u03b1 is an unknown parameter, usu-\nally considered to be smaller than unity. The \u03b1-prescription can\nalso be put in the following equivalent form, which involves the\nkinematical viscosity coefficient \u03bd\n\u03bd = \u03b1cs H , (5)\nwhere H is the thickness of the disc.\nThe effect of viscosity on the energy balance is twofold: viscous\ntorques convect energy between neighbouring annuli of the disc and\nthey dissipate energy. The energy which is convected across a ring\nat radius R per unit time is given by\ndE\ndt\n= 2\u03c0R2TR\u03c6\b, (6)\nwhile the dissipation rate per unit surface is given by\nD(R) = TR\u03c6 |R\b\u2032|. (7)\nIf the disc is in thermal equilibrium, we can derive a useful relation\nbetween the viscosity coefficient \u03b1 and the cooling time-scale. If we\nassume that cooling can be simply parametrized in the following way\nQ\u2212 = U\ntcool\n= \u0006c\n2\ns\n\u03b3 (\u03b3 \u2212 1)tcool , (8)\nwhere U is the internal energy per unit surface and \u03b3 is the ratio of\nthe specific heats, then, equating the viscous dissipation term, ex-\npressed in equation (7) to the cooling term, expressed in equation (8),\nleads to\n\u03b1 =\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223d ln \bd ln R\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n\u22122 1\n\u03b3 (\u03b3 \u2212 1)tcool\b, (9)\nwhere we have also used equation (4).\n2.2 Self-gravitating discs\nWe will now turn to the transport properties of self-gravitating discs.\nThe gravitational potential due to the disc will be denoted by \u000es,\nand g = \u2212\u2207\u000es is the gravitational field.\nIt can be shown (Lynden-Bell & Kalnajs 1972) that the equation\nof angular momentum conservation can be put in a form analo-\ngous to equation (3), as required in a viscous framework, where the\ngravitational stress tensor is\nT gravR\u03c6 =\n\u222b\ndz\ngRg\u03c6\n4\u03c0G\n. (10)\nEquation (10) only accounts for the transport induced by the gravita-\ntional field itself. Gravitational instabilities will also produce density\nand velocity perturbations that contribute to the transport and should\nbe included in the calculations. This contribution (the \u2018Reynolds\u2019\nstress) can be expressed as\nT ReynR\u03c6 = \u0006\u03b4vR\u03b4v\u03c6, (11)\nwhere \u03b4v= v\u2212 u is the velocity fluctuation, with v the fluid velocity\nand u the mean fluid velocity.\nGiven an expression for the gravitational stress tensor, one could\ntherefore be tempted to use the \u03b1-prescription, and to assume that\nT R\u03c6 is simply proportional to the local pressure. If large-scale struc-\nture and global processes play a role in self-regulating the disc, it\ncould even be possible to give a \u2018generalized\u2019 \u03b1-prescription, where\n\u03b1 is to be determined by some global requirement (on this point,\nsee Coppi 1980; Bertin 1997). In any case, even if such global\nparametrization is possible, it should be emphasized that the previ-\nous comments only apply to angular momentum transport. We still\nhave to face the issue of energy transport in self-gravitating discs. In\nparticular, we should check whether gravitational instabilities trans-\nport energy between neighbouring annuli according to equation (6)\nand whether they dissipate energy according to equation (7).\nBalbus & Papaloizou (1999) have shown that, in general, energy\ntransport cannot be described viscously. The energy balance equa-\ntion for self-gravitating discs contains some \u2018extra\u2019 terms (see equa-\ntion 59 in Balbus & Papaloizou 1999), that Balbus & Papaloizou\nascribe to global wave transport. The important issue at this stage is\nto determine how important these extra terms are, and under which\nconditions they are able to influence the energy balance in the disc.\nIn this paper we use global numerical simulations in order to\ncompute explicitly the different physical quantities described in this\nsection. In particular, we will evaluate the gravitational stress ten-\nsor, according to equations (10) and (11), and the corresponding\n\u2018viscous\u2019 dissipation term, which can then be directly compared to\nthe power actually dissipated in our simulated discs.\n3 N U M E R I C A L S E T- U P\n3.1 The code\nThe 3D simulations presented here were performed using SPH, a\nLagrangian hydrodynamic code (see Benz 1990; Monaghan 1992).\nIn these simulations the central object is modelled as a point mass\non to which gas particles can accrete if they approach to within\nthe sink radius, while the gaseous disc is simulated using 250 000\nSPH particles. Both the point mass and the gas particles use a tree\nto determine neighbours and to calculate gravitational forces (Benz\n1990), and the central object is free to move under the influence of\nthe disc gas. A significant saving in computational time is made by\nusing individual, particle time-steps (Bate, Bonnell & Price 1995)\nwith the time-steps for each particle limited by the Courant condition\nand by a force condition (Monaghan 1992).\nBecause the main aim of this work is to check the energy pro-\ncesses associated with gravitational instabilities, we explicitly solve\nthe energy balance equation for the gas. We allow the disc to heat\nup due to both PdV work and viscous dissipation. The ratio of the\nspecific heats is assumed to be \u03b3 = 5\/3. For the cooling, we fol-\nlow Gammie (2001) and add a simple cooling term to the energy\nequation. Specifically, we use the same type of parametrization as\nin equation (8). For a particle with internal energy per unit mass ui,\nthe cooling is implemented using\ndui\ndt\n= \u2212 ui\ntcool\n, (12)\nwith t cool = \u03b2\b\u22121. Gammie (2001) and Rice et al. (2003b) have\nshown that, for small cooling times, the disc may fragment into\ngravitationally bound objects while, for longer cooling times, the\ndisc settles into a quasi-steady state with the imposed cooling bal-\nanced by dissipation through the growth of the gravitational instabil-\nity. In particular, Gammie (2001) has shown that the fragmentation\nboundary occurs for t cool \u0002 3\b\u22121, while Rice et al. (2003b) show\nthat global effects may lead to an enhanced tendency for fragmenta-\ntion, so that the critical value for t cool is increased. The reason why a\ndisc that cools too rapidly is more prone to fragmentation is because\ngravitational heating of the disc occurs on the dynamical time-scale,\nC\u00a9 2004 RAS, MNRAS 351, 630\u2013642\n at :: on N\novem\nber 23, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nLocality of transport in self-gravitating discs 633\nso if the disc cools very rapidly, self-gravity has not enough time\nto prevent the formation of bound objects in the disc. In our simu-\nlations we have adopted \u03b2 = 7.5, in which case none of our discs\nshould or was found to fragment.\n3.2 Initial conditions\nWe consider a system comprising a central star, modelled as a point\nmass with mass M\u0002, surrounded by a disc with mass M disc. We have\nperformed three simulations with mass ratios q = M disc\/M\u0002, of\n0.05, 0.1 and 0.25, respectively. The initial surface density profile\nis taken to be a power law \u0006 \u221d R\u22121, while the initial temperature\nprofile is T \u221d R\u22121\/2. The initial velocity profile is calculated by in-\ncluding the enclosed cylindrical mass when determining the angular\nfrequency \b. With these initial conditions, the minimum value of\nQ is attained at the outer edge of the disc. For each simulation the\ntemperature normalization is chosen such that the minimum value\nof Q is Qmin = 2, and the whole disc is initially gravitationally sta-\nble. The disc is assumed to be in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium\n(see, for example, Pringle 1981), and we compute the scaleheight,\nH, using H = cs\/\b and distribute the particles such that the vertical\ndensity profile is a Gaussian. Actually, in a self-gravitating disc, the\nvertical density profile is not rigorously Gaussian (Bertin & Lodato\n1999), so our initial set-up, strictly speaking, is not in dynamical\nequilibrium. However, dynamical equilibrium is achieved rapidly\n(i.e. in a dynamical time-scale) during the simulation.\nOur calculations are essentially scale-free. In dimensionless units,\nthe disc extends from R in = 0.25 to Rout = 25, and we have taken\nM\u0002 = 1. In these units, one dynamical time-scale (orbital period) at\nR = 1 is equal to 2\u03c0 code units. Therefore, one orbital period at the\nouter edge of the disc is roughly equal to 800 time units.\nThe disc is not initially in thermal equilibrium because the main\nsource of heating, i.e. gravitational instabilities, is turned off because\nthe disc is initially stable, while cooling is already effective. We\nfollow our simulations for \u22485000 time units (i.e. approximately six\norbital periods at the outer edge of the disc), by which stage the\nwhole disc has reached thermal equilibrium.\n3.3 Artificial viscosity: the Balsara switch\nThe standard SPH viscosity (e.g. Monaghan 1992) consists of a\nquadratic term similar to a Von Neumann\u2013Richtmeyer viscosity\n(characterized by a dimensionless coefficient called \u03b2 SPH) and a\nlinear term that introduces a viscosity in shearing flows (character-\nized by a dimensionless coefficient called \u03b1SPH). Because the goal\nof this work is to study transport associated with gravitational insta-\nbilities, we would like to reduce any angular momentum transport\nassociated purely with the artificial viscosity (i.e. we wish to reduce\nthe artificial shear viscosity).\nBalsara (1995) suggested adding a shear correction term, known\nas the Balsara switch, to the standard SPH artificial viscosity which\nmaintains the viscosity in compressional flows but reduces it to zero\nin pure shear flows. For all the simulations presented here we have\nused the Balsara form of the artificial viscosity and have used a\nvalue of 0.1 for the coefficient of the linear artificial viscosity term\n(\u03b1SPH) and a value of 0.2 for the coefficient of the quadratic viscosity\nterm. A detailed discussion of the transport of angular momentum\ninduced by the chosen artificial viscosity is presented in Appendix A.\nHere we anticipate that the angular momentum transport induced by\nartificial viscosity is at least a factor of 10 smaller than that induced\nby gravitational instabilities in our simulated discs, and therefore\nplays a minor role in the dynamics of the disc.\n4 R E S U LT S\n4.1 General features\nIn all our simulations the disc initially cools down until the value\nof Q becomes small enough for gravitational instabilities to be-\ncome effective and to provide a source of effective heating. At later\nstages the disc settles into a quasi-steady state, where the heating\nprovided by the instabilities balances the imposed cooling term. As\npredicted by the argument of self-regulation, this quasi-steady state\nis characterized by an almost constant value of Q \u2248 1, over a wide\nradial range. The main features of the simulations are summarized\nin Figs 1\u20134.\nFig. 1 shows the surface density structure for the three simula-\ntions, with different total disc mass (q = 0.05, 0.1 and 0.25). The\nglobal structure induced by self-gravity is clearly seen in all three\ncases. The density enhancement in the spiral arms \u0012\u03c1\/\u03c1 typically\nranges between 2 and 4 in all cases. Already from this figure it can\nbe noticed that, as the total disc mass increases, the pattern of the in-\nstability becomes progressively more dominated by low-m modes.\nThis is confirmed by the Fourier analysis shown in Fig. 2, that shows\nhow, in the higher total mass cases, the modes with m < 5 domi-\nnate the structure. The Fourier amplitudes in Fig. 2 are computed\nas follows. We divide the disc in concentric rings of width \u0012R =\n2.5 in dimensionless units. For each ring we then compute the mode\namplitude Am as\nAm =\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\nNring\u2211\ni=1\ne\u2212im\u03c6i\nNring\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223, (13)\nwhere N ring is the number of particles in the ring, and \u03c6 i is the\nazimuthal angle of the ith particle.\nFig. 3 shows the radial profile of Q at three different times, to-\nwards the end of the simulation. The profile is not significantly al-\ntered with time, indicating that the simulations have reached thermal\nequilibrium, and are in a quasi-steady state. Actually, the fact that\nthe self-regulated value of Q turns out to be so close to unity in our\nsimulations is quite remarkable. In fact, the marginal stability value\n\u00afQ is equal to unity only when the perturbation analysis is restricted\nto the case of the axisymmetric stability of an infinitesimally thin\ndisc. The disc thickness has an important stabilizing effect, which\nleads to a lower temperature (and thus a lower value of Q) of the\nmarginally stable state; on the other hand, even a light disc can be\ndestabilized by the presence of swing amplified non-axisymmetric\ndisturbances with high m (for a discussion of these mechanisms see,\nfor example, Bertin 2000). It then appears that these two competing\neffects basically counterbalance each other. A detailed investigation\nof the combined effect of these physical mechanisms in determining\nthe precise value of Q at marginal stability is, however, beyond the\nscope of the present paper.\nFig. 4 displays the initial and final radial profiles of the surface\ndensity (averaged in the azimuthal direction). It can be noticed that\nthere is no significant evolution of the surface density at large radii.\nThe major changes in the surface density occur close to the bound-\naries. In particular, there is a rapid drop in surface density close to the\ninner boundary. This is due to the fact that we have not attempted\nto give a detailed description of the boundary layer. The sudden\nlack of SPH particles at R < 0.25 causes an increased artificial\npressure which pushes the inner particles into the sink radius of the\nstar. This effect should be reduced with a more accurate description\nof the boundary layer. We have also checked that the total angular\nC\u00a9 2004 RAS, MNRAS 351, 630\u2013642\n at :: on N\novem\nber 23, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n634 G.

This is not a serious issue in our case, because in our sim-\nulations only mildly supersonic shocks are involved. Based on the\ndensity contrast in the spiral arms, we estimate the Mach number\nof the shocks to beM \u0001 1.5. At these low values ofM, a value\nof \u03b2 SPH \u2248 0.2 is already sufficient to stop particle interpenetration\n(Bate 1995). This is confirmed by the well-defined spiral structure\nthat we obtain (which would have been smeared out if significant\nparticle interpenetration was indeed present), consistent with the re-\nsults of previous simulations that used the standard SPH viscosity\nand higher values for the viscosity coefficients (Rice et al. 2003a,b).\n4.2 Angular momentum transport and energy dissipation\nThe torque produced by gravitational instabilities in the disc is given\nby the sum of the two terms described in equations (10) and (11).\nAfter averaging the stress tensor azimuthally and radially, over a\nsmall region \u0012R = 0.1, we compute the corresponding value of \u03b1\n(see equation 4):\n\u03b1(R) =\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223d ln \bd ln R\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n\u22121 \u2329T gravR\u03c6 \u232a+ \u2329T ReynR\u03c6 \u232a\n\u0006c2s\n. (14)\nThe resulting radial profiles of \u03b1 are shown in Fig. 5 for the three\ncases q = 0.05, 0.1 and 0.25. The upper panels show separately\nthe hydrodynamic and gravitational contributions to \u03b1, while the\nbottom panels show the sum of the two. The plots show the time\naverage of \u03b1 at the end of the simulation, once the disc has reached\na quasi-steady state. The time-averaging interval is 500 time units,\ni.e. 0.6 orbital times at the outer disc edge.\nWe can now use the general results of viscous disc theory outlined\nin Section 2 to test the locality of transport in our simulations. In fact,\nequation (9) gives us firm expectations for the value of \u03b1 needed to\nbalance the imposed cooling, if energy dissipation can be treated in\na viscous framework, i.e. by using equation (7). In particular, in our\nsimulations t cool\b = \u03b2 = 7.5, \u03b3 = 5\/3 and, because our discs are\nnearly Keplerian, d ln \b\/d ln R \u2248 \u22123\/2. Inserting these numbers\nin equation (9) would give us an expected value of \u03b1 \u2248 0.05. It\nis important to note that the fact that the expected \u03b1 turns out to\nbe nearly independent on radius is a result of choosing the cooling\ntime to be simply proportional to the dynamical time-scale. In the\ngeneral case, of course, the resulting \u03b1 need not be constant. The\ndotted line in Fig. 5 shows the expected value of \u03b1. Our results are\nin fairly good agreement with the expectations of viscous transport\ntheory.\nIt is also interesting to compare the dissipation rate D(R) that\nwould result if the transport process were viscous, i.e. computing\nD(R) based on equation (7), with the actual dissipation rate.

This comparison\nis shown in Fig. 6, where the solid line shows D(R) computed from\nequation (7), while the dotted line shows the cooling rate. Again,\nthe plots show a good agreement with the expectations, the only\nexception being the outer parts of the most massive disc, where the\nactual dissipation rate seems to be slightly larger than that expected\nfrom a viscous process.\nIn general, our results indicate that, up to disc masses of\nM disc = 0.25M\u0002, gravitationally induced transport is reasonably\nwell described within a local framework. This result could also be\nanticipated because the disc dynamics in all three simulations are\ndominated by rather high-m modes, that dissipate on a short length-\nscale.\nAs a separate test for the locality of the transport, we have also\ncomputed \u03b1part(R, d), which we define as the gravitational part of\n\u03b1(R), taking into account only those particles inside a spherical\nradius d from the radial point R where we compute the stress. This\nquantity gives us a measure of the size of the region that has the most\nsignificant contribution to the gravitational stress at a given point.\nHowever, it should be kept in mind that this quantity only accounts\nfor the stress produced by the gravitational field, without including\nthe hydrodynamical component.\nFig. 7 shows the results for R = 15 for the three simulations. The\nupper panel shows clearly that the more massive the disc, the more\ndistant regions from the point contribute to the stress. However, it\nshould be noted that, because in the thermal equilibrium state Q \u2248 1\nin all three cases, a more massive disc is also characterized by a\nlarger value of the effective thermal speed cs, and is therefore thicker.\nBecause we expect that gravitational disturbances propagate over a\nlength-scale of the order of the thickness of the disc, to compare\nappropriately the results of the three simulations, we should check\nthe dependence of \u03b1part on d\/H. This is shown in the bottom panel\nof Fig. 7. In all cases, more than 80 per cent of the contribution to\nthe gravitational torque comes from a region with size \u0012 \u2248 10H .\nTransport is local if \u0012 \f R. We can therefore conclude that angular\nmomentum transport is determined by local conditions only for discs\nwith H\/R \f 0.1. When Q \u2248 1, the ratio H\/R is proportional to\nM disc\/M\u0002, which means that sufficiently massive discs may violate\nthe previous condition. Actually, our most massive disc (for which\nM disc\/M\u0002 = 0.25) only marginally satisfies H\/R < 0.1. Indeed, as\ncan be seen from Figs 5 and 6, global wave transport might play\nsome role in the outer disc, in this case.\n5 D I S C U S S I O N\n5.1 Comparison with previous work\nThe distinctive feature of the present work is that we have performed\nglobal, 3D simulations of massive discs, including the detailed\nC\u00a9 2004 RAS, MNRAS 351, 630\u2013642\n at :: on N\novem\nber 23, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n636 G.

Our\nsimulations are similar to those performed by Rice et al. (2003a,b),\nwith the difference that these previous investigations were concerned\nabout either the motion of the central object caused by the massive\ndisc, or the issue of fragmentation of the disc, while here the main\ngoal is to characterize the transport properties induced by gravita-\ntional instabilities.\nWe believe that both performing 3D simulations and solving ex-\nplicitly the energy equation are essential to determine the final out-\ncome of the instabilities. In fact, the dynamical properties of self-\ngravitating discs are determined to a large extent by the process of\nself-regulation, which is strongly dependent on the detailed heating\nand cooling mechanisms, as outlined in the introduction. Further-\nmore, because one of the main tests we want to perform is to check\nthe type of dissipative process associated with gravitational insta-\nbilities, solving the energy equation is essential. The requirement\nof 3D simulation is also fundamental, because the typical size of\ngravitational disturbances is related to the disc thickness, so that\nany zero-thickness simulation will automatically lead to an under-\nestimate of global effects.\nPrevious numerical work carried out on the subject includes:\nglobal, 3D SPH simulations of massive isothermal discs (Laughlin\n& Bodenheimer 1994); global, 2D SPH simulations with detailed\nheating and cooling (Nelson et al. 2000); global, 3D grid-based sim-\nulations with heating and cooling (Pickett et al. 2000); and local, 2D\ngrid-based simulations with heating and cooling (Gammie 2001). In\nthis section we describe the similarities and the differences between\nour study and these previous studies.\nOne of the first studies of gravitational instabilities in discs was\nperformed by Laughlin & Bodenheimer (1994). They modelled a\nvery massive disc (with M disc \u2248 M\u0002) and followed its evolution with\na 3D SPH code, without including any heating or cooling term, but\nsimply assuming that the disc was locally isothermal. In this study,\nthe authors also tried to give a detailed characterization of the trans-\nport. Their approach was however slightly different to ours, in that\nthey evolved their simulation long enough to capture the viscous\nevolution of the disc, and then compared the evolution of the az-\nimuthally averaged surface density with simple one-dimensional\nviscous models, concluding that the disc evolution could be well\nreproduced by a viscous model with \u03b1 \u2248 0.03. This work is impor-\ntant because it clarifies that gravitational instabilities are actually\nable to transport angular momentum efficiently and that the surface\ndensity evolution is indeed of a diffusive nature, as expected (see\nSection 2), but does not answer the important question of whether\nenergy dissipation is local or global.\nNelson et al. (2000) performed 2D simulations with particular\nemphasis on the cooling processes in the disc and included a more\nrealistic cooling function than the simple parametrization adopted\nhere. Their disc mass was M disc = 0.2M\u0002, very similar to our\nmost massive case.

Indeed, in our simula-\ntions most of the angular momentum is carried by collective in-\nstabilities and by gravitational torques, rather than by the artificial\nshear. Comparing the dissipation rates from shock heating with that\nfrom turbulent heating in their simulations, Nelson et al. (2000) con-\nclude that, at least in the outer disc, gravitational torques should not\ncontribute more than the torques associated with artificial viscosity,\nwhile in our simulation gravitational torques are everywhere dom-\ninant. A possible reason for this discrepancy lies in the 3D nature\nof our simulations, which may allow gravitational disturbances to\ntravel further and allows low-m modes to be more prominent. Ac-\ntually, even if the mode amplitudes that we obtain here (see Fig. 2)\nare in rough agreement with those obtained by Nelson et al. (2000),\nthey find very similar mode amplitudes for all modes with m < 8,\nwhile in our case there is a marked increase of mode amplitude for\nmodes with m < 5 (see Fig. 2).\nGammie (2001) performed an analysis very similar to our own\n(actually, we adopt the same prescription for the cooling term, see\nequation 12). The main difference is that Gammie\u2019s simulations\nare local and 2D, while ours are global and 3D. He computes the\neffective \u03b1 based on equation (14), as we do. The main results that\nwe obtain are basically in agreement with Gammie\u2019s results, in that\nthe expected value of \u03b1 from a viscous theory of discs is very close\nto the computed value in the simulations. However, by using a global\napproach, we are now able to check how these results depend on the\ntotal disc mass and on the disc thickness, whereas Gammie could\nonly extrapolate his results to thicker configurations.\nRecently, Johnson & Gammie (2003) have extended the work of\nGammie (2001) to include a more realistic cooling function in 2D\nsimulations. Actually, the use of detailed cooling functions makes\nit even more important to perform a full 3D simulation, because\nmost of the radiative transport will occur in the vertical direction,\nso that using vertically averaged values for the relevant physical\nquantities, as done by Johnson & Gammie (2003), might lead to\nincorrect results.\n5.2 Impact on observed systems\nIt is now commonly accepted that most low-mass young stellar ob-\njects possess a circumstellar disc, with lifetimes of at least 1 Myr.\nCircumstellar discs play an important role in the process of star\nformation and are believed to be the site where planet formation oc-\ncurs.

Especially in the earliest phases of star forma-\ntion these discs might be fairly massive; for example, Launhardt &\nSargent (2001), using submm observations, report the discovery of\na massive disc (with M disc\/M\u0002 \u0003 0.3) in a very young (class I)\nprotostellar object. There are also some indications that the discs in\nFU Orionis objects might be fairly massive; Sandell & Weintraub\n(2001) report M disc\/M\u0002 \u0003 0.1 in most of the FU Orionis discs they\nhave observed. As already mentioned, detailed modelling of FU\nOrionis outbursts produces radial profiles of Q that fall below unity\nalready at a distance of \u22481 au from the central object (Bell & Lin\n1994). All these systems are likely to be affected by self-gravity\nthat, if indeed energy dissipation is non-local, may produce some\nobservable modification in the SED. It is then interesting to see that\nthe models by Bell & Lin (1994) predict H\/R\u0003 0.1, which, accord-\ning to the results of this work, are large enough for non-local effects\nto become important, as suggested by Lodato & Bertin (2001).\nIn the context of AGN discs, the distance at which the disc be-\ncomes marginally stable to gravitational instabilities is typically of\nthe order of 103 Rg (Lodato & Bertin 2003), where Rg is the grav-\nitational radius of the black hole. Water maser emission (Greenhill\n& Gwinn 1997) and radio continuum observations (Gallimore et al.\n1997) show that in many cases the disc can extend to radii much\nlarger than that, thus allowing self-gravity to influence the disc struc-\nture. In this context, self-regulated models have been applied both\nto the modelling of the SED (Sirko & Goodman 2003) and to the\nmodelling of the rotation curve in the outer disc of the Seyfert galaxy\nNGC 1068 (Lodato & Bertin 2003). Johnson & Gammie (2003) use\ntheir 2D results with \u2018realistic\u2019 cooling (see Section 5.1) to argue\nthat the disc model proposed by Lodato & Bertin (2003) for NGC\n1068 would be subject to fragmentation, but unfortunately Johnson\n& Gammie (2003) do not explore the region of the parameter space\nrelevant to the Lodato & Bertin model.\nAs a final comment, we note that the present work refers to the\nsituation where the dominant source of transport and dissipation is\nprovided by gravitational instabilities. In observed systems, other\nsources of transport could be present, which might reduce the effect\nof gravitational instabilities.\n6 C O N C L U S I O N S\nIn this paper we have investigated the transport properties induced by\ndisc self-gravity in relatively massive accretion discs.

To this goal, we have performed global, 3D simulations using\nSPH.\nMost of the recent work on the subject has focused on the issue\nof the conditions for disc fragmentation, especially in relation to the\nprocess of planet formation in protostellar discs (Boss 2002; Mayer\net al. 2002; Rice et al. 2003b), or massive star formation in AGN\ndiscs (Levin 2003; Goodman & Tan 2004). Here, we would like\nto check the behaviour of self-gravitating discs in the case where\nfragmentation does not occur and the disc evolves towards a quasi-\nsteady state where cooling is balanced by heating from gravitational\ninstabilities.\nThe issue of the transport properties induced by gravitational\ninstabilities has been discussed analytically in the past by Lynden-\nBell & Kalnajs (1972) and, more recently, by Balbus & Papaloizou\n(1999). There are two major aspects of the problem, as follows. (i)\nTo what extent is the shear stress T R\u03c6 at a given radius R determined\nby local conditions? This point directly calls into question the use\nof the \u03b1 formalism, which explicitly requires that T R\u03c6 is only de-\npendent on the local values of density and thermal velocity (see also\nthe discussion in Section 2.2). (ii) The second aspect is whether\nenergy transport is only determined by the gravitationally induced\nshear stress or whether instead global wave transport occurs, hence\ninfluencing energy dissipation in the disc, as argued by Balbus &\nPapaloizou (1999).\nC\u00a9 2004 RAS, MNRAS 351, 630\u2013642\n at :: on N\novem\nber 23, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n640 G. Lodato and W. K. M. Rice\nWe have performed several simulations, with different values of\nthe ratio M disc\/M\u0002, to test how the global transport properties of the\ndisc change with increasing total disc mass. Our simulations appear\nto evolve to a quasi-steady state, characterized by an almost flat\nprofile of the axisymmetric stability parameter Q \u2248 1, in which the\nheating provided by gravitational instabilities balances the imposed\ncooling rate. We have computed the torque induced by gravitational\ninstabilities and the corresponding viscous dissipation rate, which\nwe then compare to the actual dissipation rate in our simulated discs.\nWe have found values of \u03b1 \u2248 0.05, in reasonable agreement with the\nexpectation from a viscous theory. Energy dissipation in our simu-\nlations is also fairly well described using a viscous approach. These\nresults directly address aspect (ii), described above, and confirm the\nargument of Balbus & Papaloizou (1999), who had indeed argued\nthat for \u2018self-regulated\u2019 discs, in which Q \u2248 1, global wave transport\nof energy would not play a major role.\nOn the other hand, we have indeed noticed that more massive discs\ntend to be dominated by lower m modes, leading to a more global\npattern of the gravitational disturbances. We have also been able to\ndetermine the size of the region that mostly contributes to the torque\nat a given point in the disc. More than 80 per cent of the torque is\nproduced within a region of size \u0012 \u2248 10H , where H is the thickness\nof the disc. These results directly address issue (i), described above.\nWe can therefore conclude that a viscous description of the transport\nin self-gravitating discs is only appropriate when H\/R \u0001 0.1. In\nsystems like FU Orionis, where models predict disc thickness \u22480.1\n(Bell & Lin 1994), global effects could play a role and modify the\ndissipation rates in the outer disc.\nThe results of this work should be extended both toward a more\nthorough investigation of the parameter space (in particular, it is\nvery important to test the transport properties of discs more mas-\nsive than 0.25M\u0002, and to explore the results obtained with different\ninitial conditions and cooling time-scale, which in the present work\nhas been taken to be t cool = 7.5\b\u22121), and toward a more realistic\ndescription of the cooling function; see, for example, Nelson et al.\n(2000) and Johnson & Gammie (2003).\nAC K N OW L E D G M E N T S\nThe simulations presented in this work were performed using the\nUK Astrophysical Fluid Facility (UKAFF).

Although this modification to the\nstandard SPH viscosity has been studied in some detail (Navarro &\nSteinmetz 1997; Thacker et al. 2000), it would be useful to have\nsome idea of the reduction in shear viscosity that occurs when using\nthis form of the artificial viscosity.\nIn the continuum limit, the linear term in the standard SPH artifi-\ncial viscosity can be shown to have the following form (Artymowicz\n& Lubow 1994; Murray 1996)\nC\u00a9 2004 RAS, MNRAS 351, 630\u2013642\n at :: on N\novem\nber 23, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nLocality of transport in self-gravitating discs 641\nFigure A1.

As shown by Lynden-Bell & Pringle\n(1974), the time evolution of the surface density and radial velocity\nof an initial Gaussian ring can be determined analytically. To test\nthe standard SPH viscosity, Murray (1996) therefore considered the\nevolution of an initial Gaussian ring with the initial radial velocity\ndetermined analytically, using equation (A1) to determine the vis-\ncosity. We have repeated this calculation and show the results in\nFig. A1. The SPH calculation had a linear viscosity coefficient of\n\u03b1SPH = 10, a sound speed of cs = 0.02, and a constant smoothing\nlength of h = 0.0075. The choice of the SPH parameter was made\nin order to be consistent with Murray (1996). As in Murray (1996),\nthe pressure forces were switched off so as to study the artificial\nviscosity in isolation. This, on the one hand, prevents the ring from\nspreading due to pressure forces, but on the other hand would cause\nFigure A2. Radial surface density plots at times of t = 0.0, t = 0.4 and t = 1.0 for an axisymmetric ring evolved using SPH (dots) and evolved analytically\n(solid lines). In the left-hand figure the Balsara switch was used in the SPH artificial viscosity while in the right-hand figure the simulation was evolved using\nthe standard SPH viscosity. The Balsara switch clearly reduces the effective shear viscosity by a factor of between 5 and 10.\nthe disc to collapse to the mid-plane. As a check that converging\nflows do not influence our results, we have also performed some\ntests with a fixed vertical coordinate of the SPH particles, and we\nfound no significant differences. The dots in Fig. A1 show the time\nevolution of the SPH surface density. For the chosen SPH param-\neters, the associated shear viscosity, according to equation (A1),\nis \u03bd = 1.9 \u00d7 10\u22124. The solid lines in Fig. A1 show the analytical\nviscous evolution of an initial Gaussian ring with an imposed shear\nviscosity of \u03bd = 1.9 \u00d7 10\u22124. As in Murray (1996) the SPH evo-\nlution of the initial Gaussian ring follows the analytical result very\nclosely and equation (A1) appears to be a good representation of the\nshear viscosity associated with the linear term in the standard SPH\nartificial viscosity.\nTo perform a similar calculation to determine the viscous transport\nwhen using the Balsara switch is more subtle because the shear\nviscosity should, ideally, go to zero. This will, of course, not be\nexactly true in practice, but we cannot now determine what the\ninitial radial velocity profile should be. To get some idea of the\nviscous transport when using the Balsara switch, we have considered\nthe time evolution of a Gaussian ring in which, because ideally\nwe expect no shear viscosity, we set the initial radial velocities to\nzero. For linear viscosity coefficients of \u03b1SPH = 0.1 and \u03b1SPH = 1\nthere is no noticeable spreading between t = 0 and t = 1. For\n\u03b1SPH = 10, however, the ring did spread slightly. The left-hand side\nof Fig. A2 shows the SPH evolution of an initial Gaussian ring (dots)\nplotted at times of, as in Fig. A1, t = 0.0, 0.4 and 1 for \u03b1SPH = 10.\nA direct comparison with the analytical prediction for the surface\ndensity evolution and with the results shown in Fig. A1 would be\nmisleading in this case, because initially the ring has to settle down\nbefore attaining the appropriate radial velocities resulting from the\nviscous evolution. As a result, the initial evolution of the ring is\nslower than predicted analytically by Lynden-Bell & Pringle (1974).\nIn the left panel of Fig. A2 we also plot the analytical evolution\nof an initial Gaussian ring (solid line) with an imposed viscosity\nof \u03bd = 8.0 \u00d7 10\u22126, which appears to best describe the average\nevolution of the ring. In order to compare these results with those\nobtained from the use of the standard SPH viscosity, we performed\nan identical calculation (with the initial radial velocities set to zero)\nexcept using the standard SPH viscosity without the Balsara switch.\nThis is shown in the right-hand side of Fig. A2. Again the dots\nrepresent the evolution of the SPH surface density at times of t =\n0.0, 0.4 and 1, and the solid line shows the analytical evolution of\nthe surface density. Also in this case, as discussed above, the initial\nevolution is slower than expected.

Rice\nt = 0 and t = 1 can be fitted with a viscosity \u03bd = 4.5 \u00d7 10\u22125. These\nresults, although not conclusive, indicate that the Balsara switch\nreduces the effective shear viscosity by a factor of between 5 and\n10. By using the Balsara switch we should therefore be able to\nreduce the angular momentum transport due to the artificial shear\nviscosity without, according to Thacker et al. (2000), significantly\ninfluencing the handling of shocks.\nA comparison between equations (A1) and (5) readily shows that\nthe artificial shear viscosity in SPH (not using the Balsara switch)\ncan be described in terms of the \u03b1 parametrization in the following\nway:\n\u03b1art = 18\u03b1SPH\nh\nH\n. (A2)\nEquation (A2) therefore shows that the magnitude of \u03b1art depends\non how well the vertical structure of the disc is resolved. In most\nof our simulations we typically had H \u2248 5h, so that, if we had\nused the normal SPH viscosity, we would expect \u03b1art \u2248 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22123,\nfor \u03b1SPH = 0.1 (the value used in all our simulations). The use of\nthe Balsara switch enables us to further reduce this contribution to\n\u03b1art \u2248 5 \u00d7 10\u22124.\nArtificial transport in disc simulations\nAs discussed in Appendix A1, thanks to the Balsara switch, we\nexpect the linear term in the viscosity to produce only a minor\ncontribution to the shear stress. However, the quadratic term of the\nartificial viscosity (parametrized by \u03b2 SPH) might still give some\ncontribution to the angular momentum transport. In addition, in\nour self-gravitating disc simulations, we have also added pressure\nforce, which might as well contribute to the stress, as found also\nby Murray (1996). Moreover, we would also like to test this issue\nin a less idealized case, with respect to the simple spreading ring\ncalculations described in Appendix A1. For this purpose, we have\nperformed some simulations, taking the same surface density profile\nas in Section 4 (i.e. \u0006 \u221d R\u22121) and a constant Q profile, with Q = 1,\nbut in which we have switched off the main source of transport and\n0 5 10 15 20 25\n0\n0.005\n0.01\n0.015\n0.02\nFigure A3.
