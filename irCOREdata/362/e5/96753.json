McDougall and others13861. Introduction\nIn dermal wound healing, after the skin is injured, several interacting events\nare initiated including inflammation, tissue formation, angiogenesis, tissue\ncontraction and tissue remodelling (Clark 1989). Crucial to all of these\nevents is the interaction of the cells with the extracellular matrix (ECM).\nAfter the blood clot has formed during the inflammatory response, white\nblood cells invade the wound region by migrating through the ECM.\nFibroblasts subsequently migrate into the region and begin to replace the\nblood clot with collagen. They biochemically alter the ECM by degrading the\nfibrin and producing collagen (Jennings & Hunt 1992). While new tissue is\nbeing generated, endothelial cells migrate into the region forming a new\nvasculature in the process known as angiogenesis (Clark 1996). The optimal\noutcome is a healed wound with new tissue identical to that surrounding the\nwound but this is typically not the case. The new tissue is usually\ncharacterized by a new architecture that differs from the original and is\nfrequently less functional than the original tissue. This remodelled tissue is\nknown as a scar.\nThe characteristics of scars are a result of altered structure and\ncomposition in the dermis. Scars typically have fewer blood vessels supplying\nthe denser connective tissue which is less elastic. The most significant\ndifference between normal tissue and scar tissue seems to be the orientation\nof the fibrous matrix. In rodents, normal tissue has a reticular collagen\npattern, whereas the collagen in scar tissue forms large parallel bundles at\napproximately right angles to the basement membrane (Whitby & Ferguson\n1991). Human scar tissue is similar, with greater collagen density, larger\nfibres and more alignment than normal tissue, although the alignment is\nparallel to the skin (Ehrlich & Krummel 1996). Further structural differences\nbetween scars and normal tissue include a different ratio of collagen types\nand a lack of hair follicles and sweat glands. In the work discussed here we\nfocus on the fibre alignment in scar tissue.\nFirst we describe the wound healing process, then review our previous\nmodelling work, and finally report new results. Our previous work will be divided\ninto three parts. Our initial modelling of collagen alignment (Dallon et al. 1999)\nwill be described in \u00a73, followed by a description of a model for wound repair\n(Dallon et al. 2000) in \u00a74, and in \u00a75, a model explaining the effects of\ntransforming growth factor-b (TGFb) (Dallon et al. 2001) will be reviewed. In \u00a76,\nwe begin reporting the new results by describing the extension of the model\ndesigned to examine the role of leucocyte signalling in wound repair, the role of\nfibroblast distribution (\u00a76a) and the effect of the activity of a diffusible\nchemoattractant (\u00a76b). Finally, we end with a discussion in \u00a77.2. Dermal wound healing\nThere are fundamental differences between foetal and adult wound healing,\nresulting in different outcomes. In adults, the end product is a scar. However,\nfoetal tissue is repaired with reduced or absent scarring (McCallion & FergusonPhil. Trans. R. Soc. A (2006)\n1387Modelling collagen during wound repair1996) and the realization of this difference has generated a large volume of\nresearch activity into mechanisms underlying scar formation.\nThe healing of full-thickness skin wounds involves a complex sequence of\noverlapping events. One of the first is the coagulation cascade (Jennings & Hunt\n1992) where fibrinogen, a soluble protein in the plasma, is converted to fibrin\nwhich polymerizes to form a blood clot. This clot stops bleeding and can dry to\nform a scab which covers the wound; it also forms a provisional matrix which\nprovides a scaffold for the invasion of various cell types. Within 24\u201348 h (Forrest\n1983; Jennings & Hunt 1992), fibroblasts start to infiltrate the wound and\ndissolve the fibrin clot replacing it with a collagen matrix. In the final phase of\nwound healing, the composition of the ECM is changed over a period of months,\nagain by dermal fibroblasts.\nAlthough several of the ECM\u2013fibroblast interactions have been experimentally\nstudied, this area remains poorly understood (Hay 1991). This is partly\nbecause all interactions have not been found, but mainly because the processes\ninvolved interact in a complex manner with nonlinear feedback. Mathematical\nmodelling is a powerful tool designed to address such complex feedback\nmechanisms.\nThe following models assume a few well-known interactions which are briefly\nsummarized. First, fibroblast movement is directed by the orientation of the\nmatrix, a phenomenon known as \u2018contact guidance\u2019 (Hsieh & Chen 1983; Clark\net al. 1990; Guido & Tranquillo 1993). Second, the ECM affects the speed of the\nfibroblasts. It is known that the matrix composition influences the motility of\nfibroblasts, which migrate more easily on fibronectin gels than on collagen gels\n(Wojciak-Stothard et al. 1997). Third, the composition of the ECM alters the\nproduction of different proteins by the fibroblasts (Clark et al. 1995; Xu & Clark\n1996). Fourth, the ECM in the wound region contains a plethora of growth\nfactors and cytokines which alter fibroblast behaviour. And finally, fibroblasts\norganize the thin collagen fibrils into the fibrous structure seen in the dermis\n(Ehrlich & Krummel 1996).\nTwo of these interactions are key to our models and deserve further\nexplanation. Firstly, the phenomenon known as \u2018contact guidance\u2019 has been\ndemonstrated directly when fibroblasts placed on oriented collagen gels\ninvade the gels in the direction of orientation (Guido & Tranquillo 1993).\nFurther evidence of this behaviour is demonstrated when fibroblasts migrate\nalong fibronectin fibrils (Hsieh & Chen 1983). The second key interaction\nrelates to the way in which collagen is produced by fibroblasts and the\ncomplex process by which the collagen polymerizes to form a fibrous network\nof matrix (Alberts et al. 2002). The fibroblasts release procollagen molecules\nvia secretory vesicles. The fusion of these vesicles with the cell membrane\ncreates deep, narrow recesses in the fibroblast\u2019s cell surface. It is in these\nrecesses that the collagen fibrils are formed. It is theorized that these deep\nrecesses give the fibroblast control over the micro-environment within which\nthe collagen fibrils are forming and thus control over the structure of the\nresulting collagen matrix (Birk & Trelstad 1986). The collagen matrix is\nitself an essential framework, which the migrating fibroblasts use as\nscaffolding to crawl along. Thus, not only do the fibroblasts affect the\norientation of the matrix, but the matrix orientation also influences the\ndirected movement of the fibroblasts.Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A (2006)\nS. McDougall and others13883. The orientation model\nWe began our modelling work with a multiscale model of a fibrous matrix and\ncells, which provides the foundation for our subsequent models. In this model we\nconsidered only one type of fibre, i.e. collagen, and one type of cell, fibroblasts.\nWe represent the fibrous matrix as a continuum and the cells as discrete entities\ndue to the scales involved. A moving fibroblast can range greatly in its length\nwith typical values of the order 100 mm, and the diameters of the collagen fibres\nare of the order 1 mm (Doillon et al. 1985; Birk & Trelstad 1986). Additionally,\nnormal dermal tissue is relatively sparsely populated with cells making a discrete\nrepresentation more realistic, although during wound healing more cells are\nrecruited to the region.\nIn the orientation model, cell paths are denoted by f i\u00f0t\u00de where the superscript\ndenotes the particular cell. The fibrous matrix is denoted by c\u00f0x; t\u00de where x\nrepresents the Cartesian coordinates of a point in the plane. The vectors c have\nunit length and their direction indicates the predominant orientation of the\nfibrous matrix at the spatial location. The cells receive directional cues from the\nfibrous matrix (see equation (3.1)) and move in a direction determined by a\nweighted average of their previous direction of motion (persistence) and the\ndirection of the fibrous matrix at their current location. The persistence term is\nincorporated into the formulation since fibroblasts tend to form and maintain a\nleading edge (Friedl et al. 1998).\nIn all the models, we assume that fibroblasts produce collagen aligned with\ntheir direction of movement. In this orientation model, we assume that\nproduction and degradation are balanced, so that the collagen density remains\nthe same. However, the collagen orientation changes according to a weighted\naverage of the velocities of nearby fibroblasts (equations (3.3) and (3.4)) as\ndescribed in equation (3.5).\nThus, the equations for the model which govern the cell motion are:\ndf i\u00f0t\u00de\ndt\nh _f\ni\u00f0t\u00deZ s v\ni\u00f0t\u00de\nkvi\u00f0t\u00dek ; \u00f03:1\u00de\nwith\nvi\u00f0t\u00deZ \u00f01Kr\u00dec\u00f0f i\u00f0t\u00de; t\u00deCr\n_f\ni\u00f0tKt\u00de\nk _f i\u00f0tKt\u00dek\n; \u00f03:2\u00de\nwhere r and s are positive constants with s representing the cell speed and t a\ntime lag. The equations which determine the fibrous matrix are:\nf \u00f0x; t\u00deZ\nXN\niZ0\nwi\u00f0x; t\u00de\n_f\ni\u00f0tKt\u00de\nk _f i\u00f0tKt\u00dek\n; \u00f03:3\u00de\nwhere t is again a time lag and N is the total number of cells. The weight\nfunction used here is defined by\nwi\u00f0x; t\u00deZ a1a 2 with aj Zmax 1K\njf i\u00f0t\u00dejKxj j\nL\n; 0\n\u0001 \u0002\n; \u00f03:4\u00dePhil. Trans. R. Soc. A (2006)\n1389Modelling collagen during wound repairwhere xZ\u00f0x1; x 2\u00de and LZ10 mm. Thus, the support of the function is a 20 by\n20 mm square. The square is used due to the lack of information in the model\nabout the cell\u2019s shape. The change in the collagen orientation is described by\ndq\u00f0x; t\u00de\ndt\nZ kkfksin\u00f0fKq\u00de; \u00f03:5\u00de\nwhere q is the angle of c, the vector representing the collagen direction and\nf\u00f0x; t\u00de is the angle of f \u00f0x; t\u00de. Thus, when the difference between the angles is\nsmall the derivative is small, and when the directions are orthogonal the rate of\nchange reaches a maximum. In addition, it is periodic so that when a fibre and\ncell are oriented in either the same direction or 1808 apart, the fibre does not\nchange direction.\nThe numerical algorithm consists of the following steps:\n(i) Interpolate the direction of movement of the cell to the grid defining the\nfibres.\n(ii) Orient the fibres with respect to the direction of the cell movement.\n(iii) Interpolate fibre direction to the location of the cell.\n(iv) Normalize the interpolated direction.\n(v) Change the direction of the fibres and normalize.\n(vi) Move the cell in the direction found in step (iii).\nFrom this relatively simple model we can learn many things. Of the three\nparameters in the model r, k and s, the overall alignment of the matrix is least\nsensitive to r. In other words, the speed of the cells s and the relative rate at\nwhich they modify the fibrous structure k seem to be more important in\ndetermining the overall alignment than the tendency of a cell to form and\nmaintain a leading edge (figure 1).\nIn addition to changing the parameters of the model, the initial conditions can\nbe varied. We examined variations in cell density, cell flux and the initial matrix\norientation. Although increases in cell density do increase alignment, simulations\nlead us to conclude that cell density is less important in determining the overall\nalignment pattern than variations in the cell flux and the initial matrix\norientation. A small region of alignment in the initial matrix can greatly\ninfluence the final overall alignment pattern. When cells enter the wound region\nfrom the same boundaries, the initial cells tend to form a region of alignment\nwhich the subsequent cells will reinforce and enhance.4. A model for dermal wound repair\nIn dermal wound healing, fibroblasts move from normal tissue into a fibrin clot\nand over a period of time replace the fibrin matrix with a collagen-based matrix\nthat forms the new tissue. We extend the orientation model to more closely\nmimic these processes, which are more complex than simple matrix orientation.\nThis includes allowing for production and degradation of different ECM\ncomponents by cells and some cellular control by the different matrix\ncomponents (Dallon et al. 2000, 2001).Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A (2006)\ninitial matrix k = 2.5 k = 5 k = 20\n(a) (b) (c) (d )\nFigure 1. The effect of altering the rate at which the fibroblasts change the fibre direction leads to a\nbiphasic response of the structure inherent in the collagen orientation structure. That is, as k\nincreases the orientation initially becomes less random and then with further increases it becomes\nmore random. (a) Initial random fibrous matrix, (b) kZ2:5, (c) kZ5 and (d) kZ20. The collagen\norientation is shown after 100 h of remodelling by the fibroblasts on a domain of 0.5 mm by\n1.0 mm. The cells have a speed of 15 mm hK1, rZ0, kZ0.15 h and the numerical grid for the vector\nfield is 101 by 51.\nS. McDougall and others1390In this extension, the matrix is still modelled as a vector field but the vectors\nare no longer unit vectors. The length of the vector represents the density of the\nfibrous protein at that location and we model both collagen and fibrin.\nThe model has the same framework as before and the same interactions of\ncontact guidance and cells orienting the fibrous matrix. In this model, the matrix\nis composed of two vectors c and b for the collagen and the fibrin, respectively.\nThe length of the vectors represents the density of each protein. The cells\nproduce collagen at a constant rate and degrade collagen at a rate proportional to\nthe amount of collagen already present. They also degrade fibrin at a rate\nproportional to the amount present. In addition, the cell speed is regulated by the\ndensity of the proteins. The speed function is taken to be the product of a linearly\nincreasing function of fibrin density (we assume that fibronectin is proportional\nto the density of fibrin) and a decreasing function of collagen density.\nThe new model is described by the following equations:\nui\u00f0t\u00deZ \u00f01Ka\u00dec\u00f0f i\u00f0t\u00de; t\u00deCab\u00f0f i\u00f0t\u00de; t\u00de; \u00f04:1\u00de\nvi\u00f0t\u00deZ \u00f01Kr\u00de u\ni\u00f0t\u00de\nkui\u00f0t\u00dekCr\n_f\ni\u00f0tKt\u00de\nk _f i\u00f0tKt\u00dek\n; \u00f04:2\u00de\nwhich allows the cells to be polarized (parametrized by r), a property we discuss\nlater.

By\nchanging these rates, the densities of the proteins are altered. This affects the\nspeed of the cells, which, as our previous model has already indicated,\nsignificantly influences the alignment pattern.\nExamining transitions from a collagen-rich environment to one rich in fibrin\ngives some additional insight, since cells interact differently with each of these\nproteins. Figure 2 shows that alignment in the collagen-rich region is significantly\ngreater than that observed in the initially fibrin-rich region. In addition, a layer\nof collagen oriented parallel to the initial protein boundary is evident.\nA simulation using constant cell speed exhibited similar effects.\nThe final orientation of the matrix is explained as follows. There are two ways\nin which the fibroblasts can interact with the fibrin and the collagen. Firstly, the\ncells reorient collagen but not fibrin, and secondly the cells move faster in fibrin.\nThe fixed speed simulation (figure 2b) indicates that the difference in matrix\norientation is not due to speed changes, but is due to the way in which cells reorient\nthe fibres. The fact that cells do not alter fibrin orientation means that its initial\norientation (which was random in these simulations) will continue to affect the\ndirection of the cells until it is totally degraded. This has a randomizing effect and\nthe final orientation of the matrix is more random in the region that was initially\nfibrin-rich. The boundary layer is also a result of the randomizing influence of the\nfibrin, as the cells are more likely to turn when they enter the fibrin.5. Modelling transforming growth factor-b in dermal wound repair\nIn this section, we describe an extension of the model designed to explore the\neffects of transforming growth factor-b (TGFb) on wound healing (Dallon et al.\n2001). It has been demonstrated that either neutralizing TGFb1 and TGFb2 or\nadding TGFb3 will reduce the extent of scarring in a wound. TGFb alters the\nwound healing process in many ways however (Roberts & Sporn 1996; O\u2019KanePhil. Trans. R. Soc. A (2006)\n1.5\n0.75\n0\n(a) (b)\nFigure 2. Alignment patterns showing the effect of an initial transition from collagen to fibrin. The\nalignment is stronger on the left side of the domain where the initial protein was collagen and\nweaker on the right side where the initial protein was fibrin. The position of the initial interface\nbetween collagen and fibrin is indicated by the arrow. In (a), the cell speed depends on the protein\ndensities with an average speed of 3.11 mm hK1, sZ15 and the total collagen density is 1.14. In (b),\nthe cell speed is constant and set at 5 mm hK1. Three hundred cells are initially placed along the\ncollagen fibrin interface with randomly chosen directions.\nS. McDougall and others1392& Ferguson 1997), and it is unclear which precise effects are responsible for\nchanging the degree of scarring. It is known that TGFb has various effects on\nfibroblasts: it acts as a chemoattractant, modulates collagen production and\ndegradation as well as cell proliferation (Clark et al. 1995; Cordeiro et al. 2000).\nMost experimental evidence suggests that the three isoforms affect fibroblasts\nsimilarly (Locci et al. 1999; Cordeiro et al. 2000). Two studies indicate some\ndifferences however; one in the way the collagen production is altered (Murata\net al. 1997) and the other in the formation of appendages in mesenchymal cells\n(Taya et al. 1999). The second study suggests that TGFb3 increases the\nproduction of filopodia, whereas TGFb1 and TGFb2 promote the formation of\nlamellipodia.\nIn order to determine which of the effects of TGFb are important in explaining\nhow this cytokine affects scar formation, we allow several parameters in our\nmodel to vary with the concentration of TGFb. The equations for the model are\nthe same as equations (4.1)\u2013(4.7) with the following changes. The speed function\nin equation (4.3) is now a function of collagen density, fibrin density and TGFb\nconcentration, s\u00f0kc\u00f0f i\u00f0t\u00de; t\u00dek; kb\u00f0f i\u00f0t\u00de; t\u00dek;TGFb\u00de. The constant parameters pc,\ndc and db in equations (4.6) and (4.7) are now all functions of TGFb concentration.\nFinally, in this model, the cells are allowed to proliferate and the rate at which\nthey proliferate depends upon the TGFb concentration. Cell proliferation is\nmodelled by introducing two populations of fibroblasts: those which dividePhil. Trans. R. Soc. A (2006)\n1393Modelling collagen during wound repairand those which do not. Dividing fibroblasts become non-dividing fibroblasts with\ntime. Each cell has a clock, not synchronized with the other cells, which\ndetermines when it should divide. When a cell divides it loses its polarity and the\ndaughter cell is placed at a small distance (10 mm) from the mother cell.\nExperimental evidence shows that the concentration of active TGFb peaks\nwithin an hour after wounding, decreases to a level above normal within 1 day,\npeaks again 5 days after wounding and then decreases more gradually until\nreaching approximately normal levels 14 days after wounding. Since fibroblasts\ndo not enter the wound until 24\u201348 h after wounding, we ignore the first peak in\nTGFb concentration and assume it to be a function of time as described earlier.\nSimulations from this model suggest that the effect of TGFb on fibroblast\nspeed, proliferation and collagen production cannot explain its effect on scar\ntissue formation (see figure 3a,b). However, the simulations suggest that the\neffect on scarring could be explained if TGFb3 causes a cell to change direction\nmore frequently than TGFb1 and TGFb2. For example, if TGFb3 causes a cell to\nbe more responsive to matrix cues in determining its direction than TGFb1 and\nTGFb2, and if the three isoforms of TGFb bind competitively, our simulations\ngive an explanation of the anti-scarring properties of TGFb3 which is consistent\nwith the experimental data.6. Extending the model to include a diffusible chemoattractant\nThe above models of Dallon et al. consider the wound space as an isolated region,\nwith fibroblasts entering through the base and the sides in a predetermined way.\nIn reality, the wound resides within intact, uninjured skin, and the fibroblasts\nenter the wound by migrating from this surrounding tissue. It is relatively\nstraightforward to extend the model to include a band of normal tissue around\nthe wound. One simply makes the computational domain larger, and specifies an\ninitial region as wounded (fibrin-based ECM and no fibroblasts), with the\nremaining tissue unwounded (collagen-based ECM, with a resident fibroblast\npopulation). However, numerical solutions of the model on such an enlarged\ndomain do not predict healing on a reasonable time-scale (figure 4). The\nmovement of fibroblasts into the wound region is extremely slow\u2014many times\nslower than the rates imposed by Dallon et al. As a result, the repair process\noccurs at a rate many times slower than that observed in practice.\nThe slow progress of repair in simulations such as that shown in figure 4 occurs\nbecause fibroblasts only enter the wound region as part of their intrinsic\nmovement in normal tissue unbiased by chemoattractants present in wound\nhealing. In reality, fibroblast movement is actively directed towards the wound\nduring healing by a range of chemical cues. For example, PDGF, IL-1b and TNF-\na are all produced by white blood cells during the inflammatory phase of healing,\nand are established chemoattractants for fibroblasts (Kim et al. 1999; Sasaki\net al. 2000).\nTo incorporate this directed movement into our model, we assume that a\nsingle generic chemoattractant is produced in the wound and diffuses into\nsurrounding tissue; for simplicity, we assume the production rate to be uniform\nin the wound, with a decay rate that is the same in the wound and in the\nsurrounding tissue. This gives a simple equation for the chemoattractantPhil. Trans. R. Soc. A (2006)\nnormal no TGFb anti-TGFb1\n(a) (b) (c)\nFigure 3. The collagen matrix for a simulation of normal wound healing with TGFb, resulting in a\nscar, is shown in (a). In (b), we show a simulation of a wound treated with an antibody for TGFb\nassuming TGFb alters cell proliferation, cell motility and flux, and collagen production. The\nsimulation suggests that these effects do not explain the effects on scar tissue formation of TGFb.\nIn (c), we show the results for a numerical experiment simulating anti-TGFb1 treatment, showing\na more disordered collagen fibre pattern that is highly reminiscent of experimental data. The more\ndisordered matrix pattern is a key component of reduced scarring. The parameters for this\nsimulation are identical to (b), except that the cells reorient approximately every 9 min instead of\nevery 27 min. The ability of a cell to change direction depends on the time discretization used when\nintegrating equation (4.3). The collagen matrix is represented after 240 h of simulation\ncorresponding to about 12 days after wounding (the fibroblasts enter the wound region between\n24 and 48 h after wounding). Red indicates high density and dark blue indicates low collagen. The\nline segments are streamlines for the collagen vector field. The region represents a cross-section of a\nslash wound with the surface of the skin at the top, normal tissue to the right and left and the\nbasement membrane at the bottom. When combining the three effects of TGFb, we assume that\nthe cell proliferation increases at 90 pg mmK3 of TGFb and then decreases for higher\nconcentrations; for the motility we combine the decreased cell speed and the elevated flux at\n90 pg mmK3 of TGFb which decreases with increased concentrations of TGFb.\nS.

A typical chemical profile is illustrated in figure 5.\nWe modify the cell movement rules to take account of this chemoattractant.\nWe assume that both the speed and direction of the cell vary with the gradientPhil.

The parameter values are\nDAZ0:5, k1Z2:0!10\nK4, k2Z0:025.\nS. McDougall and others1396One final change to the model is required. Dallon et al. assume that the\nmajority of the fibroblasts enter the wound through its base, with only a minority\nentering through the sides. This assumption is based on cell staining experiments\nof Adams (1997), and reflects the significant increase in fibroblast density with\ndepth in unwounded dermis. Thus, the upper part of the dermis, near the\nepidermis, is relatively acellular, whereas the part near the fascia has a high\ndensity of fibroblasts. In the model, we simply impose a linear variation in\nfibroblast density as an initial condition; the limited fibroblast movement within\nnormal tissue means that the density gradient is maintained over the time-scale\nof wound repair. The initial linear density gradient is achieved by inverting a\nlinear probability distribution function of fibroblast density as a function of\ndepth from the skin surface.

We plot the collagen\nprofile both during the early stages of repair and after 100 h of the proliferative\nphase of healing (this corresponds to about 7 days post-wounding). A steady\ngradient of a chemoattractant is rapidly established, and this directs fibroblasts\ninto the wound, so that healing proceeds at a similar rate to that observed in\npractice. As in the previous model, the fibroblasts break down the initial fibrin-\nbased matrix and replace it with collagen. Initially, collagen fibres are laid downPhil. Trans. R. Soc.

The fibroblasts\nmove rapidly into the wound in response to the chemical gradient, break down the fibrin matrix,\nand replace it with collagen fibres whose alignment reflects the direction of fibroblast migration.\nThe parameter values are DAZ0:5, k1Z2:0!10\nK4, k2Z0:025, kVAkcritZ0:5kVAkmax, aZ10.\nOther model details and parameter values are as in figure 3.\nFigure 7. An illustration of the change in collagen profile with the steepness of the chemoattractant\ngradient. (a) A highly diffuse chemoattractant causes fibroblasts to move towards the wound, and\nthus reorient the collagen matrix, over a large region of unwounded tissue. (b) Conversely, a highly\nlocalized chemoattractant only affects the movement of fibroblasts close to the wound periphery.\nTherefore, in (a) the wound and normal tissue matrices are highly interwoven, whereas in (b), they\nare relatively distinct, resulting in a much greater risk of rupture. The parameter values are as in\nfigure 6 except for (a) DAZ2:0 and (b) DAZ0:1.\nS. McDougall and others1398in the direction of fibroblast movement, and this orientation pattern is reinforced\nby the tendency of successive fibroblasts to move along the existing fibres. In this\nextended model, fibroblast direction is also strongly influenced by the\nchemoattractant profile, and as a result the collagen fibre orientation pattern\nreflects the gradient of chemoattractant. In figure 6, we also show the fibroblast\ndistribution. This illustrates the gradient of fibroblast density in unwounded\nskin, and shows that this is reflected in the wound, with significantly higher cell\nnumbers at the base of the wound compared to the top.\nOur extended model demonstrates that the rapid influx of fibroblasts into the\nwound space can be explained simply as a result of a chemoattractant gradient,\ncoupled with the variation of fibroblast density with depth in unwounded dermis.\nThe new model also enables the study of an important feature of wound repair\nthat is outside the scope of the model of Dallon et al., namely the extent to which\nthe collagen matrix around the wound is altered during healing. In figure 6, therePhil. Trans. R. Soc. A (2006)\nFigure 8. An illustration of the dependence of wound collagen profile on the variation of fibroblast\ndensity with depth in unwounded dermis. In (a), we show the effect of assuming uniform fibroblast\ndensity in the dermis: there is a much more uniform deposition of collagen than in the reference\nsolution (figure 6). In (b), we use a fibroblast density that is heavily skewed towards the base of the\ndermis; in this case the collagen fibres in the wound are predominantly oriented perpendicular to\nthe skin surface because most fibroblasts enter the wound through its base. The model details and\nparameter values are as in figure 6, except for the fibroblast distribution. The total number of\ndermal fibroblasts is the same in (a), (b) and in figure 6; in (b), the distribution of fibroblasts has\n20% of fibroblasts above the wound base, distributed as a linear function of depth in the dermis,\nand 80% below the wound base.\n1399Modelling collagen during wound repairis a clear reorientation of the collagen fibres around the wound, over a distance of\nabout half the wound width (0.25 mm). This is caused by the fibroblasts\nremodelling the matrix as they move towards the wound. This reorientation of\nthe existing collagen matrix results in an interdigitation of collagen fibres inPhil. Trans. R. Soc. A (2006)\nFigure 9. The effects of neglecting the dependence of fibroblast speed on chemoattractant gradient.\nFewer fibroblasts enter the wound in comparison to the reference case (figure 6), and as a result the\nrate of collagen deposition is lower, but the orientation pattern remains broadly similar.

McDougall and others1400the scar and the surrounding tissue, which is a crucial factor for wound strength.\nBy varying the parameters associated with the chemoattractant in our model, we\nhave found that the degree of interdigitation depends critically on the spread of\nchemoattractant into the tissue around the wound. A very widely dispersed\nchemoattractant profile leads to fibroblast recruitment into the wound from a\nlarge area of surrounding tissue, and a consequently high degree of\ninterdigitation (figure 7). Similarly, a highly localized chemoattractant profile\ncauses the scar and the surrounding tissue to be poorly linked (figure 7).\nTherefore, our model makes the novel prediction that wound strength could be\nimproved by manipulation of the chemical gradients set up during the\ninflammatory phase of repair. Moreover, experimental measurements on the\nextent of interdigitation could be used to better constrain some of our model\nparameters.\n(a ) The role of fibroblast distribution\nIn figure 6, we have imposed a variation in fibroblast density with unwounded\ndermis, with higher cell densities at greater depths. Such a variation occurs in\npractice, but we are not aware of any quantitative data from which an\nappropriate functional form could be estimated. This makes it important to\nstudy the way in which the healing profile changes with the assumed fibroblast\ndistribution. In figure 8a, we show the effects of neglecting the cell densityPhil. Trans. R. Soc. A (2006)\nFigure 10. The effects of neglecting the dependence of fibroblast direction on chemoattractant\ngradient. Significantly fewer fibroblasts enter the wound in comparison to the reference case\n(figure 6), and as a result the rate of collagen deposition is much lower. In addition, the orientation\npattern is significantly altered, with a much more disordered appearance that is more reminiscent\nof unwounded dermis. The model details and parameter values are as in figure 6 except that the cell\ndirection is given by vold.\n1401Modelling collagen during wound repairgradient and assuming a uniform distribution of fibroblasts in the dermis. In\ncomparison to the reference solution in figure 6, there is a much more uniform\ndeposition of collagen in the wound, and a higher degree of fibre alignment\nparallel to the skin surface. This latter effect is a result of more cells entering the\nwound through the sides rather than the base. This alignment is greatly reduced\nif we assume that the fibroblast distribution is heavily skewed towards the lower\nparts of the dermis (figure 8b). In this case, most of the cells entering the wound\ndo so through the base, simply because of the high cell number below the wound,\nand as a result the wound collagen at later times has a predominant orientation\nperpendicular to the skin surface.(b ) The activity of the chemoattractant\nThe chemoattractant plays a key role in orchestrating fibroblast movement into\nthe wound. In our model, we assume that both the speed and direction of cell\nmovement are regulated by the chemoattractant gradient, and it is important to\nunderstand how these two separate effects conspire to produce the observed healing\npattern. In figure 9, we show the collagen pattern given by neglecting the\ndependence of cell speed on chemoattractant gradient, so that only cell direction isPhil. Trans. R. Soc. A (2006)\nFigure 11. The effects of changing the way in which the chemoattractant gradient alters cell\ndirection. This simulation is a crude representation of the addition of an agent that binds\ncompetitively to the chemoattractant receptors on the fibroblast surface. The collagen fibres in the\nwound are much more disordered than in the reference case (figure 6), corresponding to higher scar\nquality. The model details and parameter values are as in figure 6, except that kVAkcritZ\n0:9kVAkmax and aZ10.\nS. McDougall and others1402affected by the chemical. As expected, fewer fibroblasts enter the wound space than\nin the reference case (figure 6), andas a result the rate of collagendeposition is lower,\nbut the orientation pattern of the collagen fibres is not significantly altered.\nNeglecting the dependence of cell direction (but not speed) on chemoattractant\nreduces the fibroblast influx into the wound even further, and hence the collagen\ndeposition is markedly reduced (figure 10). But in addition, the orientation pattern\nof the collagen fibres is significantly altered,with amore randomdistribution that is\nmuch closer to unwounded dermis.\nThe latter result suggests that the degree of scarring may depend critically\non the way in which the cell orientation is regulated by chemoattractant\ngradient\u2014mathematically, this means the dependence of r2 on VA, which is an\nincreasing saturating function, and which we represent mathematically as a Hill\nfunction. In a series of \u2018mathematical experiments\u2019, we have found that it is\npossible to significantly alter the orientation pattern of the collagen fibres in the\nscar by altering the parameters of this Hill function. A gradual increase in cell\norientation with chemoattractant gradient results in a highly oriented collagen\nmatrix, both within the scar and in the surrounding tissue (not illustrated for\nbrevity). This is because the cells reorient and move towards the wound over a\nlarge region of intact dermis, and continue this directed movement throughoutPhil. Trans. R. Soc. A (2006)\n1403Modelling collagen during wound repairthe wound. Conversely, if the chemical gradient has little effect on the cell\norientation when it is small, with a steep increase in the cell orientation\nresponse at higher gradients, the collagen pattern in the wound is much more\ndisordered (figure 11), corresponding to high scar quality. In figure 11, the\nfibroblasts close to the wound edge are directed into the wound by the high\nchemoattractant gradients at the wound edge. However, the chemical has little\neffect on fibroblast direction either far from the wound, or within the\nwound\u2014because the chemical gradient is relatively low at both locations.\nOnce in the wound, fibroblast movement is regulated mainly by ECM\ncomposition and orientation, and this results in a disordered scar matrix,\nsuch as that shown in figure 11.7. Discussion\nWe have presented a multiscale modelling framework which allows us to\nanalyse the effects of different factors on collagen alignment and scar\nformation during dermal wound healing. From a therapeutic point of view,\nthese results suggest an anti-scarring treatment that decreases the sensitivity\nof fibroblast reorientation to chemoattractant gradients. This could be\nachieved in practice by adding an agent that binds preferentially to the\nchemoattractant receptors on the cell surface. The anti-scarring agent\nmannose-6-phosphate acts via exactly this type of competitive inhibition,\nbinding preferentially to TGFb receptors, thereby reducing the effective\nconcentration of TGFb (Ferguson & O\u2019Kane 2004). It has been proposed that\nthe lower degree of scarring that results from this treatment is due to changes\nin fibroblast motility (Taya et al. 1999; Dallon et al. 2001). Our results suggest\nthat in fact, changes in effective chemotactic activity of TGFb may also be an\nimportant contribution to the anti-scarring effect. Moreover, we suggest that\ncompetitive inhibition of the binding of other chemoattractants to dermal\nfibroblasts may represent a novel alternative or supplementary approach to\nanti-scarring therapy.Editors\u2019 note\nPlease see also related communications in this focussed issue by Byrne et al.\n(2006) and Lu et al.
