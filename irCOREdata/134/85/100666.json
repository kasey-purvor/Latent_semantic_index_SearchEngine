When the deposition param-\neter is varied cyclically during deposition, we obtain a band-\ngap modulation in an essentially homogenous material\nsystem,2,3 leading to higher device speeds and controllable\nelectronic properties. The confining potential of a band-gap-\nmodulated artificial structure on the electron wave function\nleads to the quantization of the particle momentum and en-\nergy, controlled by the well\u2019s width and depth and the num-\nber of alternating barrier and well layers.4,5 This can lead to\nthe tailoring of devices for specific applications, such as fre-\nquency generators for the mobile phone industry. The design\nand testing of manufacturing processes for superlattices re-\nquire not only the ability to characterize the morphology of\nthe individual layers, but also their individual electronic\nproperties. This places electron energy loss spectroscopy\n\u0001EELS\u0002 in a transmission electron microscope \u0001TEM\u0002 in the\nunique position of providing all this information. Here, we\nuse an alternative method of acquiring spectral information\non a subnanometer scale, and then set the theoretical basis\nfor interpreting the measured collective excitation on the\nsubnanometer scale. We then extract the tunneling effective\nmass by modeling the changes measured in the collective\nexcitations using the \u201cparticle-in-a-box\u201d quantum confine-\nment model.\nIn an electron microscope, it is possible to image the\nbarrier and well layers constituent of a superlattice, even\na\u0002Author to whom correspondence should be addressed; electronic mail:\ns.silva@surrey.ac.uk\n0003-6951\/2006\/88\u000212\u0001\/122109\/3\/$23.00 88, 12210\nDownloaded 30 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132.

Redistribution subject towe can also neglect the effect of chromatic aberration. The\nresulting instrumental spatial resolution is approximately\n0.7 nm \u0001for a dispersion of \u00050.45 nm\/pixel\u0002.\nBulk collective modes of oscillation extend \u0001normal to\nthe beam direction\u0002 typically over 5\u201310 nm.8 However, an\ninterface between two media leads to the establishment of a\nsurface mode of oscillation, which acts to screen out the bulk\nplasmons from each other. This is known as the \u201cbegren-\nzungs\u201d effect8,9 which manifests as the replacement \u0001not\noverlap\u0002 of the bulk plasmon by the interface plasmon, lead-\ning to an effective screening. In order to evaluate the in-\ncrease in plasmon energy in the middle of the well caused by\nthe contributions from the interface and barrier plasmons, we\nsimulate the dielectric response for a theoretical one-\ndimensional well of variable width, confined by infinitely\nlong barriers. We use the classical dielectric approach10 to\ncalculate the energy loss of the relativistic electron, as a\nfunction of its position across the well, for a sandwich\ninterface.11 Dielectric functions derived from the low energy-\nloss spectra of the well and barrier test layers were input in a\ndedicated program.12\nBefore comparing with the experimental results, the cal-\nculated positions of the plasmon energies across a well are\nconvoluted with our estimated spatial resolution \u0001\u00050.7 nm\u0002.\nWhile the bulk plasmons are delocalized events, which\ncan extend over several nanometers, the presence of interface\nexcitations and their effective screening allows for the mea-\nsurement of bulk plasmons within layers narrower than their\nextinction distances. Only when the well width becomes\n\u00011 nm, there is a more significant contribution to the plas-\nmon energy in the well from the surface and barrier plas-\nmons \u0001Fig. 3\u2014open triangles\u0002. Even for well widths down to\n0.5 nm, it is still possible to interpret the bulk plasmon en-\nergy by modeling the changes and applying a suitable\ncorrection.\nFigure 3 \u0001squares\u0002 also compares the experimental dif-\nference between the barrier and well plasmon energies, as a\nfunction of well width.

Eg is the Penn\ngap, which adjusts the free electron model at small values of\nthe wave vector k for Bragg reflections and Umklapp\nprocesses.14\nUsing the measured2 refractive indices nbarrier=2.1 and\nnwell=2.2 and the plasmon energies measured on the test bar-\nrier and well layers \u0001EPbarrier=24.400 eV and EPwell\n=24.225 eV\u0002, we calculate \u0003Eq. \u00011\u0002\u0004 the Penn gap energies to\nbe Egbarrier=13.210 eV and Egwell=12.360 eV. These Penn\ngap energies are then used to determine the depth of the\none-dimensional box4 with which we model the changes in\nthe ground state of the trapped electron wave function \u0001depth\n0.425 eV=one-half of the band-gap difference\u0002, as a function\nof well thickness. The theoretical increase in the Penn band-\ngap energy as a function of the well thickness is now used to\nrelate back to the plasmon energy \u0003Eq. \u00011\u0002\u0004; however, this\nrequires knowledge of the effective mass for amorphous car-\nbons. The effective mass found experimentally \u0001using EELS\u0002\nand theoretically15,16 for amorphous carbons is m*=0.87me,\nwhile Silva et al.2,3 have shown a tunneling effective mass\nfor amorphous carbon superlattices m*=0.067me. Assuming\nthat the free-electron component in Eq. \u00011\u0002 does not change\nwith changing well width, we obtain the difference between\nthe bulk and the well plasmon energies as a function of well\nwidth, for the two effective mass hypotheses \u0001Fig. 3, half\ntriangles, open circles\u0002. From Fig. 3, it is clear that m*\n=0.067me is a good fit for our measured changes in the plas-\nmon energies, when compared with m*=0.87me. If the effec-\ntive mass is used as a parameter in fitting the experimental\ndata in Fig. 3, then we find that this method could be used to\ndetermine the effective mass to within 0.02me. The apparent\ndiscrepancy between the effective masses available in litera-\nture can be explained as follows: The Penn band gap used in\nEq. \u00011\u0002 is modeled using particle-in-a-box calculations,\nwhich are based on the matching of the wave function at the\nboundaries, as constrained by the boundary conditions.\nHence, the effective mass resulting from this fitting is related\nto the boundaries between wells and barriers, i.e., the tunnel-\ning effective mass, as opposed to m*=0.87me, which is re-\nlated to dipole transitions in EELS and thus, to a bulk value\nfor the layers.\nDownloaded 30 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132. Redistribution subject toUsing spatially resolved low-energy loss spectra ac-\nquired in a TEM, under parallel illumination, we have char-\nacterized the electronic structure of amorphous carbon super-\nlattices. We have shown that the changes in plasmon energy\nmeasured for wells, as a function of decreasing well width,\nare due to quantum confinement and can be modeled using\nthe particle-in-a-box theory. By modeling the contribution of\nthe interface plasmon excitations, we show that the delocal-\nized bulk collective excitations can be used to characterize\nthe electronic properties of the wells and barriers, respec-\ntively, down to well thicknesses of \u00050.5 nm, due to the ef-\nfective screening provided by the interfaces. We find that the\ntunneling effective mass is m*=0.067me. We show that this\ndoes not contradict the effective mass value found for amor-\nphous carbon,15,16 as it refers to different symmetry points in\nthe band diagram.
