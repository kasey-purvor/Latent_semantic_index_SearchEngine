INTRODUCTION\nModels of exotic neutron-rich nuclei predict interesting,\nas yet unexplored, new physics [1]. However, these nuclei\nare largely difficult to access in experiments. Isomeric states\nare proving to be a convenient tool to access and explore\nexcited states in neutron-rich nuclei [2]. In well-deformed\nnuclei, isomerism can usually be ascribed to K-forbidden\nand\/or high-multipolarity transitions [3]. After accounting\nfor these aspects, the reduced hindrance then depends pri-\nmarily on \u201clocal\u201d nuclear-structure K-mixing effects, such\nas density of states, deviations from axial symmetry, and\nCoriolis mixing [3]. Taken together, these many influences\nseverely complicate the prediction of isomer decay rates.\nNevertheless, the experimental identification of isomeric states\nhas a pivotal role in studies of nuclei approaching the drip-lines\n[2,4] and even of some of the heaviest nuclei synthesized\nto date [5]. Although there is evidence for exotic proton\nand two-proton decay modes of isomers near the proton\ndrip-line [6], analogous questions regarding the neutron decay\nmode of isomers in the neutron-rich region are still open [7].\nAdditionally, one of the goals of a future study of neutron-rich\nnuclei in the Dy-Hf region is to search for the possible\nexistence of an \u201cisland\u201d of \u03b2-decaying high-K isomers [3,8].\nFurthermore, isomer production, especially with high-energy\nproton-induced reactions, is still poorly understood, and will\n\u2217Electronic address: rsc1@triumf.ca\nbe important for future radioactive-beam projects. There are\nopen questions on the reaction mechanism and production\ncross sections of isomers in even-even, odd-even, and odd-odd\nnuclei [9]. Additional complications arise because of the\nunknown release times of isomers and exotic nuclei from, for\nexample, surface-ionization ion sources. Thus, experiments\nform a crucial component to address these issues.\nA new program of research in the deformed, isomer-rich,\n170\u2013190 mass region [3,8,10] has been launched at the Isotope\nSeparator and Accelerator (ISAC) facility sited at TRIUMF,\nVancouver, Canada. In the present work we report on the\ncharacterization of a new 2.29 s isomer in neutron-rich 174Tm\n(Z = 69). The motivation to study such deformed odd-odd\nnuclei is based on their level structures, whose excitation\nspectra are among the most intricate and poorly characterized\nin nuclear structure physics [11]. This is associated with\npartially blocked pairing, high level density (resulting in a\nmultitude of low-lying configurations), and complex decay\npatterns. The high probability of isomeric states is a key feature\nin the spectra of these nuclei, and their identification can lead\nto unambiguous temporal ordering of excited states. Such is\nthe case with 174Tm, as presented here.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE AND RESULTS\nIn the present series of experiments, nuclei far from the\nline of \u03b2 stability are produced at the ISAC facility using\n30-\u00b5A 500-MeV proton-induced reactions on a Ta target. The\nreaction products deexcite during transit, whereas long-lived\n0556-2813\/2006\/73(2)\/024306(5)\/$23.00 024306-1 \u00a92006 The American Physical Society\nR. S. CHAKRAWARTHY et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 73, 024306 (2006)\nisomers (T1\/2 \u0001 a few milliseconds) allow a fraction of the\nisotopes to be delivered in an excited state. The reaction\nproducts are extracted using a surface ionization source and\naccelerated to an energy of 30 keV. A high-resolution mass\nanalyzer separates species with different mass number, which\nare then transported to experimental stations such as the\n8\u03c0 spectrometer. This spectrometer has been reconfigured\nin a close-packed configuration [12] and is comprised of 20\nCompton-suppressed high-purity germanium detectors. The\nlow-energy beams from ISAC are focused at the center of\nthe 8\u03c0 array and stopped in a 12.7-mm-wide continuous-loop\ncollector tape that is fed from a large aluminum storage\nchamber. The movable tape transport facility removes long-\nlived activity from the focus of the 8\u03c0 array and minimizes the\ncontaminating activity present in an isobaric beam. Within the\n8\u03c0 array, an aluminum hemispherical mounting houses five\nSi(Li) detectors in a pentagonal geometry, cooled to liquid-\nnitrogen temperatures. Typically, the off-line intrinsic resolu-\ntion of the (cooled) Si(Li) detectors is 2.9-keV at 975-keV\n(K-shell converted electron of the 1063-keV transition in\n207Bi); whereas the in-beam resolution is 1.85-keV at 302-keV\n(K-shell converted electron of the 364-keV transition in 174Tm\n\u03b2 decay). Each of the five Si(Li) detectors, 5 mm thick, circular\nin shape, and with an area of 200 mm2, was mounted at a\ndistance of 2.2 cm from the beam focus. The Pentagonal Array\nfor Conversion Electron Spectroscopy (PACES) covers 8% of\nthe solid angle [13].\nIn two sets of experiments several of the known high-K\nisomers in the Dy-Hf region, with half-lives ranging from a\nfew milliseconds to several minutes, have been accessed [14].\nWe report here the spectroscopy of a new 2.29(1) s isomer\nin the neutron-rich nucleus 174Tm. An initial study measuring\nonly the \u03b3 transitions was presented at ENAM04 [15]. The\nA = 174 isobaric beam was implanted into the movable tape\ntransport facility, with beam-off\/beam-on\/beam-off cycling\ntimes of 2s\/2s\/2s, 2s\/3s\/3s, 5s\/10s\/10s, and 10s\/100s\/50s. Any\nremnant radioactive decay from the beam particles missing\nthe tape were monitored in the initial beam-off period after\nmoving the tape.\nSingles and coincidence \u03b3 -\u03b3, \u03b3 -electron, and electron-\nelectron data were acquired and sorted off-line into several\nmatrices; these include \u03b3 -time, electron-time, \u03b3 -\u03b3, \u03b3 -electron,\nand electron-electron coincidence matrices. Standard radioac-\ntive sources of 152Eu, 133Ba, 207Bi, as well as the known\n\u03b3 -ray and electron peaks from 174Tm ground-state \u03b2 decay,\nwere utilized to calibrate the spectra. The accumulated \u03b3 -ray\ndata were dominated by the ground-state \u03b2 decay of 174Tm\n(T1\/2 = 5.4 min). The detection of new isomers is compounded\nby the presence of multiple decay sources of varying intensities\nin the form of (here, A = 174) isobaric contaminants as\nwell as ionized fluoride\/oxide molecular beams (leading to\ndecays from the A = 158 and A = 155 mass chains). Despite\ncontamination, a judicious choice of cycling times enabled\nrather clean separation of, especially, short-lived isomers. The\nyields of the A = 174 oxide beam, mainly emanating from the\ndecay of 158Er and 158Tm, were measured to be 13 and 1% of\nthe 174Tmg.s. yield, respectively; whereas the decays from the\nA = 174 fluoride beam, primarily from 155Tm, was measured\nto be at a 0.03% level. Figure 1 shows the singles \u03b3 -ray\nspectrum, after subtracting the dominant 174Tmg.s. activity.\nThe inset shows the growth and decay curve of the 2.29(1)\ns isomer in the 2s\/3s\/3s tape cycle [15]; the prominent\npeaks are the 100.3- and 152.1-keV \u03b3 -ray transitions and the\nTm K x rays. The ground-state-to-isomer ratio (later corrected\nfor electron conversion) is 200:1 and demonstrates the device\nsensitivity. The two coincident \u03b3 -ray transitions were, in\naddition, also known to be present in the ground-state \u03b2 decay\nof 174Er, which has a half-life of 3.3 min [16,17]. From the\n\u03b3 -\u03b3 coincidence data, K-conversion coefficients of 3.1(1) and\n1.13(6) were extracted, respectively, for these two transitions\nand were the basis for M1 assignments in the previous\nworks [15,17].\nThe ground-state spin and parity of 174Tm are known to\nbe I\u03c0 = 4\u2212, as deduced from the ground-state systematics of\nthe odd-proton Tm isotopes and the N = 105 isotones, and\nthe allowed-unhindered \u03b2 decay proceeding to the lowest two\nexcited 5\u2212 states in 174Yb [18].

K\u03b3\ndenotes the conversion-electron corresponding\nto the \u03b3 -ray transition, whereas the Tm x rays\nare labeled K\u03b1\/K\u03b2 .\nmust be of low spin. Hence an unobserved low-energy, high-\nmultipolarity transition was postulated between the low-spin\nstates observed following \u03b2 decay and the high-spin ground\nstate [17]. However, several issues could not be resolved from\n\u03b3 -ray spectroscopy alone. These relate to the large intensity\ndifference between the two, seemingly M1, \u03b3 -ray transitions\nat 100 and 152 keV; the absence of a 252-keV crossover E2\ntransition; and speculation that the isomeric state could be\na new excited state, the decay of which could not itself be\nestablished, requiring population from a hypothesised high-K\n\u03b2-decaying isomer in 174Er [15].\nA closer examination of the K-electron conversion coef-\nficient for the 152-keV transition, extracted from x-ray and\n\u03b3 -ray intensities [15,17], reveals that it agrees, within error,\nwith the values expected [19] for a M1 multipolarity (\u03b1K =\n0.81) and an E3 multipolarity (\u03b1K = 1.18). Furthermore, a\nE3 multipolarity for the 152-keV transition would explain\nthe large intensity imbalance with the 100-keV transition\nthat arises from the earlier deduction of M1 multipolarity\nfor both transitions. However, the L-conversion coefficients\nwould differ greatly (\u03b1L = 0.12 and 4.1 for M1 and E3 mul-\ntipolarity, respectively), motivating a measurement involving\na conversion-electron spectrometer. Therefore, in a follow-up\nexperiment, a new conversion-electron spectrometer, PACES,\nwas brought on-line at the 8\u03c0 -spectrometer station. The singles\nconversion-electron spectrum obtained by subtracting (with\nappropriate time restrictions) the transitions from the 5.4 m\n174Tm ground-state \u03b2 decay is depicted in Fig. 2. This clearly\nillustrates electrons from K-, L-, and M-converted transitions\nthat are involved in the isomer decay, in addition to the Tm K\u03b1\nand K\u03b2 x rays.

Analysis\nof the electron-electron coincidence matrix shows the expected\ncoincidence relationships between the K and L conversions\nemanating from the two coincident transitions.\nIII. DISCUSSION\nAs discussed, the ground-state spin-parity of 174Tm was\ndeduced to be 4\u2212. In view of the lack of a crossover \u03b3 -ray\ntransition (I\u03b3 252-keV \u0002 0.34% I\u03b3 100-keV) or a highly\nconverted M4 transition, in the \u201csingles\u201d conversion-electron\nspectrum (Fig. 1), it is reasonable to infer that the 100- and\n152-keV transitions are of stretched M1 and E3 character,\nrespectively. A 100-keV M1 transition would not give rise to\nsuch a long half-life, so the 152\u2013100 keV transition ordering\nis well defined. Accordingly, the spin-parity sequence is\n(in increasing energy order) either 4\u2212 \u2212 5\u2212 \u2212 8+ or 4\u2212 \u2212\n3\u2212 \u2212 0+. Only the 0+ assignment for the 252-keV isomer\nis consistent with the known indirect feeding from the \u03b2 decay\nof 174Er [16,17].\nBecause this is one of the most deformed regions of the\nnuclear chart, the levels can be classified by the K quantum\nnumber, equal to the value of the spin of each intrinsic state.\nThus, the isomer acquires a K\u03c0 = 0+ assignment. The iden-\ntification of the isomer contradicts the previous claim of ob-\nserving the 100- and 152-keV \u03b3 -ray transitions in coincidence\nwith \u03b2 particles from the 174Er ground-state decay [16,17].\nTransitions with energies of 637, 643, 708, 714, 766, and 773\nkeV were observed in both the LBNL and GSI 174Er \u03b2 decay\ndata [16,17], though not in the present work, as an erbium\nbeam is not produced efficiently by the ion source. These \u03b3 -ray\ntransitions likely feed the K\u03c0 = 0+ isomer and originate from\nlow-spin levels, consistent with a scenario of allowed Gamow-\nTeller \u03b2 decay. Indeed, the summed singles intensities of all\nthese transitions [17] is 94(4)% of the total (\u03b3 + e\u2212) intensity\nof each of the 100- and 152-keV transitions (from the deduced\nM1 and E3 assignments, respectively). Furthermore, a direct\n174Er (I\u03c0 = 0+g.s) \u2192 174Tm(I\u03c0 = 0+isomer) Fermi transition will\nbe strongly suppressed because of the nonanalog nature of\nthe orbitals involved, consistent with the observed intensity\nflow.\nThe same selection rule also forbids \u03b2 decay of the\n174Tm isomer to 174Yb K\u03c0 = 0+ levels. An upper limit\nof 1.0(5)% \u03b2-decay branch could be deduced for such a\nforbidden decay. This limit was determined from the peak-\nfree region of the electron spectrum from the 2s\/3s\/3s tape\ncycle after background subtraction from the e\u2212 time data.\n(A significant branch would indicate the importance of the\nso-called correction terms [20].)\nA simple structural description of the observed states\ncan be obtained purely by considering the available single-\nparticle orbitals near the Fermi surface. For 174Tm, the\nrelevant proton single-particle Nilsson orbitals have quantum\nnumbers 1\/2+[411] and 7\/2\u2212[523], at a calculated quadrupole\ndeformation of \u03b22 \u223c 0.28 [21]. These orbitals couple with\nthe neutron Nilsson orbitals, namely 7\/2\u2212[514], 5\/2\u2212[512],\nand 1\/2\u2212[521], to produce a set of low-lying intrinsic states\nin 174Tm. By comparison to the odd-A neighbors, the odd\nproton of 174Tm is likely to be in the 1\/2+[411] Nilsson orbital\n(173,175Tm I\u03c0g.s. = 1\/2+), and the odd neutron in the 7\/2\u2212[514]\nNilsson orbital (173Er,175Yb I\u03c0g.s. = 7\/2\u2212). Following the em-\npirical Gallagher-Moszkowski (GM) rules [22], a coupling of\nthe orbitals \u03c01\/2+[411] \u2297 \u03bd7\/2\u2212[514], a spin-parallel triplet\nstate, is especially energetically favored and gives rise to\nthe ground-state spin-parity of K\u03c0 = 4\u2212. The observation of\nallowed-unhindered \u03b2 decay to the K\u03c0 = 5\u2212 states in 174Yb\nlends further support to this assignment [18].\nThe K\u03c0 = 3\u2212 state at 100-keV is suggested to be the singlet\ncoupling of the GM-doublet arising out of the same orbitals,\n\u03c01\/2+[411] \u2297 \u03bd7\/2\u2212[514]. The 100-keV M1 transition is\nthen a K-allowed transition between the GM-doublet mem-\nbers. Indeed, calculations based on the quasiparticle phonon\nmodel (QPM) predict the two lowest lying intrinsic states\nin 174Tm as a result of such a coupling, and the calculated\nsplitting of 94-keV is very close to the observed splitting of\n100-keV (neglecting zero-point rotational motion) [11]. The\ncontribution of this quasiparticle configuration is about 66\nand 63% in the triplet and singlet states, respectively; a small\ncontribution of 12% is calculated to arise from a Q22 collective\nvibration.\nThe K\u03c0 = 0+ state at 252 keV is seen to result from a\nfavored coupling of the \u03c07\/2\u2212[523] \u2297 \u03bd7\/2\u2212[514] Nilsson\norbitals. The 152-keV E3 transition is then a K-allowed\nproton-hole transition from the intruder h11\/2(\u2297h9\/2) or-\nbital to the normal-parity d3\/2 orbital. Incidentally, for this\n024306-4\nK\u03c0 = 0+ 2.29 s ISOMER IN NEUTRON-RICH 174Tm PHYSICAL REVIEW C 73, 024306 (2006)\nconfiguration the protons and neutrons occupy the spin-orbit\npartners of the 1h orbital; such states are, supposedly, highly\nfavored because of an attractive proton-neutron interaction.\nThe 152-keV transition occurs between two intrinsic states\ndiffering only in the proton orbital, whereas the neutron\norbital is a spectator. Likewise, the 100-keV transition involves\na proton spin-flip. Thus, the two observed transitions in\nthe decay scheme of the 2.29 s isomer can be explained\nas being K-allowed transitions that occur between three\ndeformed intrinsic states involving only proton excitations.\nIn well-deformed odd-odd nuclei, in addition to the usual\nK-selection rule, there is a two-particle transition selection\nrule involving the so-called nonoverlap forbidenness such\nthat a simultaneous change of proton and neutron intrinsic\nconfigurations is severely hindered [23]. The proposed ex-\ncitation scheme is consistent with the requirements of these\ntwo selection rules. From the measured half-life of 2.29 s,\na B(E3) value of 0.021(1) W.u. [using theoretical value of\n\u03b1(theo)(total) = 6.61] or, using the measured conversion elec-\ntron coefficient \u03b1(expt.)(K+L+M) = 5.5(5), a B(E3) value of\n0.024(2) W.u. could be deduced for the 152 keV, K\u03c0 = 0+ \u2192\nK\u03c0 = 3\u2212, transition. In terms of the hindrance factor, defined\nas [24]\nFW = T1\/2\u03b3 (experiment)\nT1\/2\u03b3 (Weisskopf)\n, (1)\nthe E3 transition is calculated to have FW = 42(4)\n[\u03b1(expt.)(K+L+M) = 5.5(4)] or 48.7(2) [\u03b1(theo)(total) = 6.61],\nwhich is well within the prescribed range for a K-allowed\n\u0006K = 3, E3 decay [24].\nIV. CONCLUSION\nIn summary, through \u03b3 -ray and conversion electron spec-\ntroscopy the excitation energy and decay properties of the\n2.29 s isomeric level in 174Tm have been firmly established.\nThe results of three different experiments [15\u201317] can be\ncombined to explain all the data consistently with a minimum\nnumber of states. The isomeric level is characterized by a\nK\u03c0 = 0+ assignment and the two coincident \u03b3 -ray transitions\ninvolve mainly proton excitations. The deduced transition\nrate is hindered but well within the prescribed limits of\nK-allowed E3 decays. It is important for future experiments\non heavy neutron-rich nuclei that there should be simultaneous\nmeasurements of both \u03b3 rays and conversion electrons, to\nderive unambiguous level schemes.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe are grateful to the hard work put in by the TRIUMF\naccelerator personnel for a smooth operation of the Cyclotron-\nISAC facility during the experiments.
