It plays\na crucial role in many classes of physical phenomena in nonequilibrium systems, including\ne.g. stochastic resonance, directed diffusion in stochastic ratchets, and nucleation in phase\ntransitions. In the case of a classical point particle, escape over a finite barrier can occur\nthrough the action of external perturbations, e.g. noise-assisted barrier crossing [1]\u2013[3]. A\nquantum particle can leave the well by tunnelling through the classically forbidden region,\nand this is true even for macroscopic quantum objects [4]. There have been great advances\nin the understanding of macroscopic quantum tunnelling, including the quantum mechanics and\ntunnelling of vortices, domain walls and fluxons [5]\u2013[10].\nIn cosmology and particle physics, there is an additional way for a particle to escape\nfrom a potential well: through the so-called Hawking radiation. Classically, the gravitation is\nso powerful around a black hole that nothing, not even radiation, can escape from it. Hawking\nhas shown, however, that quantum effects allow black holes to emit radiation. A simplified view\nof this process is that vacuum fluctuations cause a particle\u2013antiparticle pair to appear close to\nthe event horizon. One particle of the pair falls into the black hole, while the other escapes. To\nan outside observer it appears that the black hole has emitted a particle [11, 12].\nIn the present paper, we extend these ideas by investigating the mechanisms by which a\n(classical) kink soliton can escape from a potential well created by space-dependent external\nperturbations.\nThe paper is organized as follows: in section 2, we review well-known results about the\nkink solutions in nonlinear Klein\u2013Gordon equations, the model equations and kink dynamics\nin inhomogeneous media. For the presentation of the new phenomena, it is very important\nNew Journal of Physics 10 (2008) 113015 (http:\/\/www.njp.org\/)\n3to understand that inhomogeneous media can create potential wells and barriers for the kink\nmotion.\nThe main result of the paper is discussed in section 3: the Hawking-like emission of a kink\nfrom a potential well. In section 3.1, we review the stability and instabilities of the kink modes,\nas these are crucial for understanding of the main result presented in section 3.2.\nIn section 4, we discuss some implications of the results in a wider context and the possible\nways of observing the new phenomena in real experiments. The phenomena of stochastic\nresonance and ratchet motion are well known, and are described briefly in sections 4.2 and 4.3.\nHowever, some of the implications of our results are discussed here for the first time, e.g. a new\nkind of solitonic ratchet based on the Hawking-like kink escape in section 4.3. The possibility\nthat the Hawking-like emission process might be observable in long Josephson junctions and\ndomain wall dynamics is considered in sections 4.4 and 4.5.\n2. Kinks and antikinks in generalized Klein\u2013Gordon equations\n2.1. The model equations\nAs a model system, we take a nonlinear Klein\u2013Gordon equation:\n\u03c6t t \u2212\u03c6xx + \u2202U (\u03c6)\n\u2202\u03c6\n= F(x), (1)\nwhereU (\u03c6) is a potential that possesses at least two minima. The sine-Gordon and \u03c64 equations\nare particular examples of (1) [13]\u2013[15].\nThe Klein\u2013Gordon equation (1) can be derived from the Lagrangian\nL= 12\u03c62t \u2212 12\u03c62x \u2212U (\u03c6)+ F(x)\u03c6 + k.\nIf we define the momentum 5= \u2202L\n\u2202\u03c6t\n, then the associated Hamiltonian will be\nH= 1252 + 12\u03c62x +U (\u03c6)\u2212 F(x)\u03c6\u2212 k,\nwhere dkdt = 0. The energy conservation law can be written as dHdt = 0, where H =\n\u222b\u221e\n\u2212\u221eH dx .\nEquation (1) is a paradigmatic model that supports kink and antikink solutions. The\nimportance of kink-solitons arises in part because of their applications, not only to particle\nphysics, but also to diverse phenomena in condensed matter physics, e.g. domain walls in\nferromagnets and ferroelectrics, dislocations in crystals, charge density waves, fluxons in long\nJosephson junctions and Josephson transmission lines [13, 15].\n2.2. Kink dynamics in inhomogeneous media\nThe effective potential V (x) for the kink is created by the external force F(x), and not by the\nnonlinearity in \u03c6 [15]\u2013[23]. However, the nonlinearity in \u03c6 that corresponds to potential U (\u03c6)\nis necessary for the existence of the kink. Suppose U (\u03c6) possesses three extrema \u03c61, \u03c62 and \u03c63,\nwhere \u03c61 and \u03c63 are minima and \u03c62 is a maximum. Once U (\u03c61)=U (\u03c63), the kink behaves as a\nfree particle governed by Newton\u2019s first law.\nThe exact solution for the \u03c64 kink, \u03c6k = tanh\n[\nx\u2212vt\u2212x0\n2\n\u221a\n1\u2212v2\n]\n, is well known and shows clearly\nthat we cannot consider U (\u03c6) as the potential in which the kink is moving. The differences\nNew Journal of Physics 10 (2008) 113015 (http:\/\/www.njp.org\/)\n4between the bistability in U (\u03c6) and V (x) have been discussed in connection with soliton\nstochastic resonance [20]. The fact that U (\u03c6) should in general have at least two minima for\nthe existence of kinks is discussed in [21]. The case when F(x)= const 6= 0 that leads to\nU (\u03c61) 6=U (\u03c63) is discussed in [21, 22].\nIt is well known [22] that when F(x)= const< 0, the kink will move to the right (positive\nx-direction) and when F(x)= const> 0, the kink will move to the left. This behaviour depends\non the sign of the topological charge, so that for the antikink we have the opposite movements. In\ngeneral, if F(x) has a zero (say at x = x\u2217) and F(x)\u2192 F2 > 0 for x \u2192\u221e and F(x)\u2192 F1 < 0\nfor x \u2192\u2212\u221e, this F(x) creates a one-well potential for the kink.\nAs discussed in [15]\u2013[23] (and references therein), inhomogeneous perturbations of soliton\nequations, both in the form of external forces or parametric impurities, generate effective\npotentials of type V (xCM) for the motion of the kink, where xCM is the coordinate of the kink\ncentre of mass. There exist many methods for obtaining this effective potential.\nAn appropriate expression for the effective force that acts on the kink, in terms of the centre\nof mass of the kink xCM, is\nF(xCM)=\u22122\n\u221e\u222b\n\u2212\u221e\nF(x) f0(x \u2212 xCM) dx, (2)\nwhere f0(x) is the translational mode. The effective potential satisfies the equation\nF(xCM)=\u2212\u2202V (xCM)\n\u2202xCM\n. (3)\nIn the case of \u03c64-equation,\nf0(x)= sech2\n(x\n2\n)\n. (4)\nFor the antikink equation (2) should be multiplied by (\u22121). There are exact solutions for the\ncase where F(x) is not constant [22]. For instance, for\nF(x)= B(4B2\u2212 1) tanh(Bx), (5)\nthe exact kink solution is \u03c6k = 2B tanh (Bx).\nIn fact, what is important about equation (5) is that there exists a zero for F(x). In this\ncase, for 4B2 > 1 the force (5) gives rise to a stable equilibrium for the kink centre of mass.\nBoth theoretical and numerical investigations show that perturbations of the initial position of\nthe kink centre of mass lead to oscillations of this variable around the point x = 0.\n2.3. Stability problem\nThere are two important techniques for investigation of kink dynamics in the presence of\nperturbations. One is the collective coordinate approach [17, 18] and the other is stability\nanalysis. Sometimes they complement each other.\nThe main objective of this subsection is to explain the stability conditions for the kink in\nthe presence of an inhomogeneous F(x)with a zero x\u2217 such that (F(x\u2217)= 0). In this subsection,\nwe will use both techniques to explain the stability conditions because both approaches can shed\nlight on the problem. One example of the application of the collective coordinate approach is\nto use the ansatz \u03c6 = \u03c6k[x \u2212 xCM(t)]. The key idea of the technique is to derive a dynamical\nequation for the collective coordinate xCM(t) that describes the dynamics of the kink centre of\nNew Journal of Physics 10 (2008) 113015 (http:\/\/www.njp.org\/)\n5mass. In [15]\u2013[17], [23], several ways for obtaining this dynamical equation are discussed. The\neffective force given by (2) is a result of such a technique.\nWe now present the stability problem. We consider perturbations of a kink-soliton placed\nat an equilibrium position created by the force F(x). This analysis leads to the spectral\nproblem\nL\u02c6 f = 0 f, (6)\nwhere \u03c6(x, t)= \u03c6k(x)+ f (x)e\u03bbt ,\nL\u02c6 =\u2212\u22022x +\n{\n\u22022U\n\u2202\u03c62\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\n\u03c6=\u03c6k\n}\n, 0 =\u2212\u03bb2. (7)\nThere are discrete eigenvalues corresponding to soliton modes (a translational mode 00, internal\nmodes 0i, and a continuous spectrum corresponding to phonon modes). Many interesting\nphenomena can be uncovered by solving this eigenvalue problem for different forms of the\nfunction F(x).\nLet us discuss the stability conditions when F(x) possesses only one zero, say at x\u2217, such\nthat \u2202F(x)\n\u2202x |x=x\u2217 > 0. We then find that the point x = x\u2217 is a stable equilibrium position for the\nkink. Otherwise, if \u2202F(x)\n\u2202x |x=x\u2217 < 0, the equilibrium position x = x\u2217 is unstable. An easier way to\nexplain this is as follows: from equation (2) we get that for intervals where F(x) > 0, the kink\nwill be pushed to the left, whereas for intervals where F(x) < 0, the kink will be pushed to the\nright. Thus if x = x\u2217 is a zero of F(x) and F(x) < 0 for x < x\u2217 and F(x) > 0 for x > x\u2217, then\nx = x\u2217 is a stable equilibrium position.\nWe should add that other exact solutions for a kink moving in the presence of an external\nforce [22] corroborate the result that the sign of F(x) defines the direction of kink motion, and\nthat the points x\u2217 where F(x) changes its sign correspond approximately to the equilibrium\npositions with \u2202F(x)\n\u2202x |x=x\u2217 > 0 as the stability condition. The stability condition for the antikink\nis \u2202F\n\u2202x |x=x\u2217 < 0.\nAs an illustration of the application of the stability analysis, consider the following\ninhomogeneous force F(x)= B(4B2\u2212 1) tanh(Bx). It has only one zero x = 0. The kink\nsolution is \u03c6k = 2B tanh(Bx).\nThe operator L\u02c6 in the spectral problem (6) does not explicitly depend on F(x). However,\nit contains information on F(x) because it depends on \u03c6k(x); and \u03c6k(x) depends on F(x). The\ncalculation of the eigenvalues of L\u02c6 for this F(x) and \u03c6k(x) leads to the following stability\ncondition for the translational mode\n4B2 > 1. (8)\nNote that this inequality coincides with the condition \u2202F(x)\n\u2202x |x=x\u2217= B\n2(4B2\u22121)\ncosh2(Bx)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\nx=0\n=B2(4B2\u2212 1)>0.\nNow suppose that F(x) is qualitatively equivalent to that shown in figure 2. That is, F(x)\nhas a maximum at xM, a zero at x = x\u2217 and a minimum at xm. In this case, \u2202F(x)\u2202x |x=x\u2217 < 0. We\nhave found that if |F(xM)\u2212 F(xm)| exceeds a critical value, the first internal (shape) mode\nfor the kink becomes unstable (01 < 0). The eigenfunction corresponding to this (shape) mode\nis always equivalent to the function f1(x)\u223c sinh(Bx)cosh3(Bx) . It is the development of the instability\nof this mode that leads to the break up of the kink (\u03c6k \u223c tanh(Bx)) and to the creation of a\nkink\u2013antikink pair.\nNew Journal of Physics 10 (2008) 113015 (http:\/\/www.njp.org\/)\n60\n0\nV(x)\nx\nx\n2\n\u2248 0 x\n1\n\u2248 \u2212d x\n3\n\u2248 G\nFigure 1. Effective potential for the soliton escape problem modelled with\nequation (1). As discussed in the text, V (x) is created by the force F(x).\n2.4. Tunnelling\nWe now suppose an external force F(x) such that a point-like kink would feel an effective\npotential like that shown in figure 1. When the kink-soliton is analysed as a point-like particle\n(i.e. in terms of collective coordinate theory for its centre of mass [17]), the zeroes of F(x) are\nequilibrium points [19, 20, 22], [24]\u2013[26]. The effective force acting on the kink centre of mass\ncan be calculated [15, 16]. When the distance between the zeroes of F(x) is comparable with the\nkink\u2019s width, however, the stability conditions for a point particle and an extended kink-soliton\nclearly differ [19, 20, 22].\nFor instance, if F(x) possesses three zeroes x1, x2, x3 such that \u2202F\u2202x |x1,3 > 0, \u2202F\u2202x |x2 < 0 then,\nfor a point-like kink, this would imply the existence of one unstable equilibrium between two\nstable equilibria. However, if |x2\u2212 x1|< lk and |x3\u2212 x2|< lk, where lk is the kink\u2019s width, the\npoint x2 is no longer unstable for the extended kink-soliton. Thus the kink-soliton will not feel\nthe barrier between the two potential wells.\nGonzalez et al [19] investigated the dynamics of a kink moving in an asymmetrical\npotential well with a finite barrier. For large values of barrier height and thickness, the kink\nbehaves as a point-like classical particle. They also revealed the existence of soliton \u2018tunnelling\u2019\nthrough the potential barrier, a phenomenon linked to stability changes in the presence of many\nzeroes of the external force [19]. When the kink width is less than those of the well and barrier,\nthe zero x1 corresponds to a true minimum of the potential: the kink feels the barrier, and it will\nnot move to the right of point x = x2. When the point x = x2 is not unstable, however, the kink\ncan move to the right, crossing the barrier even if its centre of mass is placed in the minimum\nof the potential and its initial velocity is zero. The kink thus tunnels with sub-barrier kinetic\nenergy [19]. See also the discussion of this phenomenon in the book [16].\nWe now consider the double-well \u03c64 potentialU (\u03c6)= (\u03c62\u2212 1)2\/8 and take the force F(x)\nin the form\nF(x)= A(4A2\u2212 1) tanh[A(x + d)]22(x)+ B(4B2\u2212 1) tanh(Bx)21(x)\n+C(4C2\u2212 1) tanh[C(x \u2212G)]23(x), (9)\nNew Journal of Physics 10 (2008) 113015 (http:\/\/www.njp.org\/)\n70 \n0 \nx\nF(x) x\nM\nx\nm\nFigure 2.

The effective potential for a\npoint-like kink is then equivalent to that shown in figure 1.\nThe stability problem for the kink solution in the neighbourhood of an equilibrium position\ncan be solved exactly. For 4A2 > 1, 4B2 < 1, 4C2 > 1, G > d > 0, the force F(x) corresponds\nto an effective potential for a point-like kink soliton that possesses a stable equilibrium around\nx = x1 \u2248\u2212d, an unstable equilibrium at x = x2 \u2248 0 and a stable equilibrium at x = x3 \u2248 G > 0.\nThis point corresponds to an equilibrium of lower potential energy than that at x = x1 \u2248\n\u2212d.

However, for d > 2, the kink remains trapped in the left potential well.\nThis behaviour can also be seen in figures 5(a) and (b) which show the different dynamical\nNew Journal of Physics 10 (2008) 113015 (http:\/\/www.njp.org\/)\n8\u22121\n0\n1\n\u22121\n0\n1\n\u22121\n0\n1\n0\n00 0 \n\u03c6\nx\n0.0 2.0 4.0\n6.0 8.0 10.0\n12.0 14.0 16.0\nFigure 3.

Initially, the kink-soliton\ncentre of mass is at the bottom of the potential well created by force F(x) given by (9) (see also\nfigure 1).\nWe stress that, in the latter situation, the kink behaves very much like a classical particle.\nTo see this, consider thermally activated barrier crossing for\n\u03c6t t + \u03b3\u03c6t \u2212\u03c6xx + \u2202U (\u03c6)\n\u2202\u03c6\n= F(x)+ \u03b7(x, t). (10)\nHere \u03b7(x, t) is a Gaussian white noise with \u3008\u03b7(x, t)\u3009 = 0 and \u3008\u03b7(x, t), \u03b7(x \u2032, t \u2032)\u3009 = 2D\u03b4(x \u2212\nx \u2032)\u03b4(t \u2212 t \u2032). The behaviour is then very similar to that in the Kramers model [1].\nFurthermore, solitonic stochastic resonance [20] can occur. Consider the equation \u03c6t t +\n\u03b3\u03c6t \u2212\u03c6xx + \u2202U (\u03c6)\u2202\u03c6 = F(x)+ P0 cos(\u03c9t)+ \u03b7(x, t), where F(x) is defined as in (9) with A = C ,\n4A2 > 1, 110 < B\n2 < 14 and G = d . This is equivalent to a symmetric bistable potential for the\nkink centre of mass. In the absence of noise, the periodic force P0 cos(\u03c9t) is unable to make\nthe kink jump between the wells. It is therefore possible to observe a maximum in a graph of\nthe signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) versus the noise intensity D [20].\n3. Pair creation and Hawking-like emission\n3.1. Kink\u2013antikink pair creation\nAs the phenomenon of kink\u2013antikink pair creation is very important for the discussion that\nfollows below, we will dedicate this subsection to its explanation, using a particular example.\nLet us consider the following equation:\n\u03c6t t \u2212\u03c6xx \u2212 12\u03c6 + 12\u03c63 = F(x), (11)\nwhere\nF(x)= 12(4B2\u2212 1) sinh(Bx)\/ cosh3(Bx). (12)\nIn this case, the exact solution for a static kink placed on the equilibrium point x = 0 is\n\u03c6k = tanh (Bx).\nNew Journal of Physics 10 (2008) 113015 (http:\/\/www.njp.org\/)\n10\nThe operator L\u02c6 of the spectral problem (6) can be written explicitly in this case:\nL\u02c6 =\u2212\u22022x +\n[\n1\u2212 3\n2 cosh2(Bx)\n]\n.\nThis is a Poschl\u2013Teller potential. The eigenvalue problem can be solved exactly [27].\nThe discrete eigenvalues from the spectral problem (6) are given by the expression 0n =\n\u221212 + B2(3+ 23n\u2212 n2), where 3(3+ 1)= 3\/2B2. The first internal shape mode is unstable\nwhen\n01 < 0. (13)\nAs 01 = B2(33\u2212 1)\u2212 12 , where 3=\n\u22121+\n\u221a\n1+6\/B2\n2 , we obtain the condition for the instability of\nthe first internal shape mode:\nB2 <\n11\u2212\u221a117\n8\n. (14)\nThe function F(x) has a maximum at certain point x = xM, a zero at point x = x\u2217 = 0 (such\nthat \u2202F\n\u2202x |x=x\u2217 < 0| ) and a minimum at certain point x = xm. The condition for the creation\nof the instability of the first internal (shape) mode can be written in terms of the extrema\nof the function: |F(xM)\u2212 F(xm)|> Fc, where Fc = 332 [\n\u221a\n117\u2212 9]. Numerical calculations\nshow that these are good estimates for the critical value Fc even when other functions F(x)\n(with a maximum, a zero and a minimum) are used. Figure 2 shows the shape of the function\nF(x) for 4B2 < 1. The point x = 0 is an unstable equilibrium point for the centre of mass of the\nkink. The effective potential for V (xCM) for the motion of the kink can be defined as follows:\nV (xCM)=\u2212\n\u222b xCM\n0\nFef(\u03be) d\u03be + Vc, (15)\nwhere\nFef(\u03be)=\u2212\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n(4B2\u2212 1) sinh(Bx)\ncosh3(Bx)\nsech2\n(\nx \u2212 \u03be\n2\n)\ndx, (16)\nand Vc is an arbitrary constant. Figure 6 shows an illustration of the effective potential V (xCM).\nThe effective potential V (xCM) can be seen as a potential barrier for the motion of the kink.\nThe effective force is exponentially small everywhere except for a localized zone that contains\nan unstable equilibrium position that is a maximum of the effective potential. Figure 7 shows\nthe evolution of the instability of the shape mode and the creation of a kink\u2013antikink pair (in\naddition to the already existing kink).\nThus, if the kink is very close to a potential barrier with these properties, then kink\u2013antikink\npairs can be created. This scenario is also valid for any other F(x) with these properties, i.e. it is\nnot restricted to the explicit function used in this simulation. Moreover, the same phenomenon\ntakes place also for the sine-Gordon equation\n\u03c6t t \u2212\u03c6xx + sin(\u03c6)= F(x), (17)\nwhere F(x)= 2(B2\u2212 1)sinh(Bx)\/cosh2(Bx). The first internal (shape) mode is unstable\nfor B2 < 2\/3\u2217(3\u2217 + 1), where 3\u2217 = (5 +\n\u221a\n17\/2). The critical value for |F(xM)\u2212 F(xm)| is\ndifferent for the sine-Gordon, but the shape of F(x) is similar to that in equation (12).\nNew Journal of Physics 10 (2008) 113015 (http:\/\/www.njp.org\/)\n11\n0\n0\nxCM\nV\n(x\nC\nM\n) \nFigure 6.

Kink\u2013antikink pair creation via the internal mode instability. The\ndimensionless time is shown in each frame.\n3.2. Hawking-like emission\nWe now show that a kink can be emitted from the potential well via an internal mode instability,\neven when the height and thickness of the barrier are very large. A kink\u2013antikink pair can be\ncreated near the potential barrier due to the internal mode instability of the original kink. The\nantikink will be attracted by the potential barrier (a stable equilibrium for the antikink), and the\nkink then escapes in a process resembling Hawking emission.\nLet us consider the situation where G > d > 2, such that kink tunnelling is impossible,\nbut where the absolute value of the derivative of F(x) at the point x = 0 is such that new\ninstabilities can develop. Thus the equilibrium points are sufficiently separated but\n\u2223\u2223 \u2202F(x)\n\u2202x\n\u2223\u2223\nx=0\ncan take relatively large values. A stability analysis [22] considering perturbations around a\nkink-soliton placed at the equilibrium position x = 0[\u03c6(x, t)= \u03c6k(x)+ f (x)e\u03bbt ] leads to the\nNew Journal of Physics 10 (2008) 113015 (http:\/\/www.njp.org\/)\n12\neigenvalue problem\nL\u02c6 f = 0 f, (18)\nwhere L\u02c6 =\u2212\u2202x 2 +\n(\n6B2\u2212 12 \u2212\n(\n6B2\ncosh2(Bx)\n))\n, 0 =\u2212\u03bb2. There are both discrete and continuous\nspectra. The discrete eigenvalues correspond to soliton modes: a translational mode 00 and an\ninternal mode 01. The continuous spectrum (0k , k > 1) corresponds to phonon modes [22]. In\nthe present case,\n00 = 2B2\u2212 12 and 01 = 5B2\u2212 12 . (19)\nThe stability condition for the equilibrium point x = 0 of the kink is defined by the eigenvalue\nof the translational mode [ f0(x)= (1\/cosh2(Bx))], i.e. 4B2 > 1. When the kink equilibrium\nposition x = 0 is unstable (i.e. 4B2 < 1), but 10B2 > 1, the kink can move away from the\npoint x = 0 without large deformations. The reason is that the internal (shape) mode f1(x)=\n(sinh(Bx))\/(cosh2(Bx)) is still stable.\nFor 10B2 < 1, however, the internal mode becomes unstable, leading to decay of the kink\ninto an antikink and two kinks (see figure 9). For a kink equilibrated on a single barrier like\nF(x)= B(4B2\u2212 1) tanh(Bx) such that the internal mode is unstable, the initial stage of kink\ndeformation is described by the solution\n\u03c6(x, t)= tanh\n(x\n2\n)\n\u2212 f10\nsinh(Bx)\ncosh2(Bx)\ne\u03bbt .\nNote that, even if the initial perturbation of the kink shape is very small ( f10 \u001c 1), the slope of\n\u03c6(x) at its centre of mass will eventually be negative, so that the kink will break up, producing\nan additional kink\u2013antikink pair. Note also that the amplitude of the deformation cannot increase\nindefinitely because of energy conservation. In fact, the final state is an antikink at point x = 0,\nand two kinks moving in opposite directions (where \u03c6(x, t) is finite everywhere).\nThe whole dynamics of the kink\u2013antikink pair creation and the kink escape in the two-well\npotential produced by F(x) defined as in (9) can be described using the dynamics of the kink\nand antikink configurations, the translational mode and the internal (shape) mode [22, 23]. It can\nbe proved that there exists a stable equilibrium stationary solution (see figure 8) that corresponds\napproximately to the final state that is represented in figure 9.\nWe have constructed a solution that describes this stable stationary state:\n\u03c6 f (x)= 2A tanh[A(x + d)]22(x)+ 2C tanh[C(x \u2212G)]23(x)\u2212 f1 tanh[Qx]21(x)24(x), (20)\nwhere 24(x)= 1\u2212tanh[D(x\u2212(G\/2))]2 , Q = B and f1 = 2C .\nThe energy balance equation is satisfied approximately H (initial conditions)= H (final\nstate). We should recall that the perturbed Klein\u2013Gordon equation (1) is not completely\nintegrable and part of the energy is radiated in the form of \u2018phonon\u2019 waves. That is, the whole\nenergy H is conserved, but not all the energy is solitonic for t \u2192\u221e.\nDue to the properties of functions 2i(x), which for D\u001d 1 behave as Heaviside functions,\nthe stability problem of solution (20) can be reduced to three simpler spectral problems similar\nto that formulated in equation (18). The solution is stable for 4A2 > 1, 4B2 < 1, 4C2 > 1.\nA more physically motivated explanation of the process may also be useful. The initial\ncondition is a kink placed close to the point x = 0. Due to the conditions discussed above, the\ninternal mode of this kink is unstable, leading to the creation of a kink\u2013antikink\u2013kink structure.\nAfter that, the first kink will be placed on the left side of the point x = 0 (the barrier). Here,\nNew Journal of Physics 10 (2008) 113015 (http:\/\/www.njp.org\/)\n13\n\u2212d 0 G \n\u22121.5\n\u22121.0\n\u22120.5\n0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\nx\n\u03c6\nf\n(x)\nFigure 8. When the internal mode of the kink near the barrier is unstable, the\nstable stationary field configuration is a kink (inside the left well), an antikink\n(near the barrier), and a kink that has escaped to the right well.\nthe function F(x) as defined by equation (9) is positive. So this kink will effectively be pushed\nto the left and it will be finally captured by the zero of function F(x) near x =\u2212d . This is a\nstable equilibrium for the kink. The antikink will be close to the point x = 0. As \u2202F\n\u2202x |x=0 < 0,\nthis is a stable equilibrium for the antikink. So the antikink remains close to this point. The\n\u2018third particle\u2019 of the trio (the other kink) will be placed on the right side of point x = 0, where\nfunction F(x) as defined by equation (9) is negative. Thus, this kink will be pushed to the right\nuntil it is finally captured by the equilibrium situated near the point x = G.\nThis scenario leads unambiguously to the Hawking emission of a kink via kink\u2013antikink\npair creation. A numerical simulation of this process is shown in figure 9.\nThe initial conditions in these simulations are \u03c6(x, t=0)=tanh [12(x + 1)], \u03c6t(x, t = 0)= 0.\nEffectively, during this process, a kink\u2013antikink pair is created due to the instability of the\noriginal kink internal mode. Note that topological charge is conserved. The point x = 0 (where\n| \u2202F(x)\n\u2202x |x=0 < 0 ) is an attractive equilibrium position for the antikink. Thus, the potential barrier\nwill capture the antikink, whereas the newly created kink escapes to the right potential well.\nThe original kink remains inside the left potential well. Figure 9 shows this phenomenon with\nan initial condition consisting of a kink inside the potential well (i.e. the kink centre of mass is\nat a point x0 < 0), but very close to the barrier that is the source of instability.\nThe emission of a kink-soliton from the potential well by the decay of a kink into an\nantikink and two kinks can also occur under less strict conditions. Suppose e.g. that the\nconditions for the internal mode instability are satisfied near the barrier, but that the kink centre\nof mass is at the bottom of the potential well, i.e. x0 =\u2212d. The kink is an extended object. So\neven when its centre of mass is at the potential minimum, the kink\u2019s \u2018wings\u2019 feel the action of\nthe potential wells. If the values of [F(x)] for x <\u2212d are sufficiently large, the kink is pushed\nto the right, closer to the barrier, and an instability will develop leading to kink emission as\ndescribed above. This phenomenon can also be observed in the perturbed sine-Gordon equation,\nwhereU (\u03c6)= 1\u2212 cos\u03c6. In fact, we can construct a function F(x) that corresponds to a bistable\nNew Journal of Physics 10 (2008) 113015 (http:\/\/www.njp.org\/)\n14\n\u22121\n0\n1\n\u22121\n0\n1\n\u22121\n0\n1\n\u2212d 0 G\n\u22121\n0\n1\n\u2212d 0 G \u2212d 0 G \n\u03c6\nx \n0.0 2.0 4.0 \n8.0 10.0\n12.0 14.0 16.0\n18.0 20.0 22.0\n6.0\nFigure 9.

We have checked this phenomenon numerically. In general,\nthe relevant features needed for it to occur are the following: U (\u03c6) should have at least two\nminima \u03c61 and \u03c63 such that for U (\u03c61)=U (\u03c63) the kink can exist (a monotonic function such\nthat \u03c6\u2192 \u03c61, as x \u2192\u2212\u221e, \u03c6\u2192 \u03c63 as x \u2192\u221e); and F(x) should generate a barrier such that\nthe first internal shape mode is unstable. The shapes of the kink and the internal mode are very\nsimilar in all equations of type (1). In the case of sine-Gordon, the exact kink solution of the\nunperturbed equation is \u03c6k(x, t)= 4 arctan{exp[(x \u2212 vt \u2212 x0)\/\n\u221a\n1\u2212 v2]}.\nNow, returning to the \u03c64-equation, if F(x) is such that |F(xM)\u2212 F(xm)|> Fc, the barrier\ncan create a kink\u2013antikink pair even if the original kink is very far inside the potential well\n(see figure 10). Here, the initial conditions are \u03c6(x, t = 0)= tanh [ 12(x + 10)], \u03c6t(x, t = 0)=\n0. Figures 5, 9 and 10 are the results of numerical simulations of the partial differential\nequation (1). We have used a standard implicit finite difference method with open boundary\nconditions \u03c6x(\u2212l, t)= \u03c6x(l, t)= 0 and a system length 2l = 2000. However, the phenomena\ndescribed do not depend on the numerical method.

However, the main qualitative features of the described phenomena will be exactly\nthe same.\nAll of these phenomena can be perceived as non-local effects attributable to the spatially\nextended character of the kink. When the kink feels the instability of the barrier, it suffers\ndeformations producing fluctuations in the field \u03c6(x, t) leading, ultimately, to development of\nthe kink\u2013antikink pair.

They can also occur for\nother forces F(x) that create three equilibria for the kink, provided that the slope of F(x) at\nthe unstable equilibrium is sufficiently large. Furthermore, F(x) can also be such that there are\nother equilibria separated from this three-equilibria basic structure.\n4. Discussion\nWe now discuss some properties of the inhomogeneous perturbations used in the present paper.\nThen we consider applications to stochastic resonance and ratchets, and discuss the possibility\nthat the Hawking-like emission process might be observable in long Josephson junctions.\n4.1. Inhomogeneous perturbations\nWhen the centre of mass of a kink is close to the equilibrium position created by\nF(x)\u223c tanh (Bx), the dynamics of the kink translational mode is equivalent to a harmonic\noscillator [20]. Our construction of F(x) in the paper is equivalent to a Kramers model, where\na bistable potential with two minima and a maximum is constructed using three parabolas. As\nalready pointed out above, our model is analytically solvable: we can solve the stability problem\nexactly for both the translational mode and all the internal modes.\nNew Journal of Physics 10 (2008) 113015 (http:\/\/www.njp.org\/)\n16\nUsing the geometrical theory of dynamical systems we can extend the results to all models\nthat are topologically equivalent to the present one [20]. This means all the models where\n(locally) F(x) possesses three zeroes that generate a bistable effective potential for the motion\nof kink centre of mass can produce this kind of dynamics. Note that the force F(x) does not\nhave to take large values in order to observe these phenomena. For instance, the F(x) given\nabove for the sine-Gordon equation has the property F(x)\u2192 0 as x \u2192\u00b1\u221e, and it is small\neverywhere. This F(x) can also be used for the \u03c64 equation. The important features are that\nF(x) should have three zeroes and that, near the central zero, the first internal mode should be\nunstable.\nThe case F(x)= const is very familiar to experimentalists [15]. This is important because\nthe phenomena presented in this paper can be observed using a F(x) constructed with piece-\nwise-constant forces as follows:\nF(x)= F1 < 0, for x < x1 < 0,\nF(x)= F2 > 0, for x1 < x < x2 = 0,\nF(x)= F3 < 0, for x2 < x < x3,\nF(x)= F4 > 0, for x > x3,\nwhere \u2212F1 = F4 and x3 >\u2212x1. We have a complete theory and simulations. There are some\nnecessary conditions for 1= F2\u2212 |F3|, and for the distance between the equilibrium points\n(i.e. where F(x) changes sign). Under some conditions, the kink remains trapped inside the left\nwell; under other conditions it can tunnel through the barrier to the right well, or it can escape\nvia a Hawking-like emission.\nThe piece-wise-constant F(x) could readily be constructed in experiments with domain\nwalls (using e.g. constant external fields) and in long Josephson junctions ([15, 16] and refer-\nences therein). We comment, firstly, that the F(x) given in these papers is very much like the\nF(x) described above in the preceding paragraphs. It is almost constant everywhere. However,\nit has the advantage that it is smooth even though it changes sign three times. Secondly,\nHawking-like emission can occur even when the absolute values of F(x) are small everywhere.\n4.2. Stochastic resonance\nAsmentioned above, a kink can [20] be involved in a motion equivalent to the original stochastic\nresonance paradigm of a particle in a bistable potential [28]. But this is only possible when\nthe equilibrium positions of the potential are sufficiently separated such that the kink feels the\nbistability and the kink internal modes are stable in the neighbourhood of all equilibrium points.\nOtherwise, the picture shown in the final frames of figures 9 and 10 applies, i.e. an antikink will\nbe stabilized in the central equilibrium positions and each of the wells will be occupied by a\nkink. We have checked numerically that the time series of the centre of mass of this structure\ndoes not then have a maximum in the SNR versus D plot, i.e. stochastic resonance does not\noccur.\n4.3. Solitonic ratchets\nThese phenomena can also give rise to ratchet behaviour. For the equation \u03c6t t + \u03b3\u03c6t \u2212\n\u03c6xx +\n(\n\u2202U (\u03c6)\n\u2202\u03c6\n)\n= F(x)+ \u03b7(x, t), ratchet motion of a single kink is possible provided certain\nconditions are satisfied by the force F(x) and the noise \u03b7(x, t). An example is the force\nNew Journal of Physics 10 (2008) 113015 (http:\/\/www.njp.org\/)\n17\nF(x)=\u2212Asin(Bx)+ 2\u00b5 Asin(2Bx + \u03b8), where \u00b5= 14 , \u03b8 = (pi\/2). In this case, \u03b7(x, t) should\nbe coloured noise [29, 30]. Ratchet motion will be affected in cases where the kink does not\nfeel all irregularities of the effective potential, and also by phenomena related to the complex\ndynamics and stability of kink internal modes. Furthermore, in some cases the kink can be\ntrapped inside the potential well created by F(x) in such a way that the kink translational mode\ndoes not exist. In such cases, kink motion is obviously very difficult [19, 23, 24].\nThe effect discussed in this paper could lead to a new kind of solitonic ratchet in systems\nwhere the kink cannot propagate: the kink is trapped in a potential well but, when it is driven by\nthe external perturbation, it approaches the barrier of the potential. A kink\u2013antikink pair is then\ncreated, and a kink is emitted. This kink can be trapped in the contiguous well and the process\ncan start again. As a result of this process, kink propagation in one direction is possible even\nthough the original kink has not abandoned its potential well.\n4.4. Hawking emission in Josephson junctions\nBefore considering the possibility of Hawking-like emission in Josephson junctions, we remark\nthat noise-assisted Hawking kink emission is also possible. Consider the case where the\nproperties of F(x) are such that the kink can sit stably at the minimum of the left potential\nwell without being pushed to the barrier by the potential wall, and the values of F(x) near\nthe barrier are such that the kink internal model should be unstable. The presence of noise can\nthen make the kink approach the barrier and break up, producing the same phenomenon as that\ndepicted for the noise-free case in figure 9.\nLong Josephson junctions are very good physical objects for the observation of the soliton\ndynamics. Akoh et al [31] constructed a device in which details of the dynamics of individual\nfluxons could be observed. They created a local inhomogeneity and they were able to capture\na fluxon using this inhomogeneity as in a potential well. Then they applied a constant bias\ncurrent to the system. The effect of all these actions is equivalent to having a kink-soliton inside\na potential well with a finite barrier on the (say) right side. They observed the escape of the\nfluxon from the potential well. The paper in question is not specific about the concepts of soliton\ntunnelling and soliton Hawking emission, probably because one needs a theoretical framework\nin order to introduce such concepts. However this experiment could now be repeated using a\nsimilar setup, and the Hawking-like emission could be specifically sought.\nIn order to be definite, we will provide some details about a possible experiment. We\nconsider a device in the form of an NbN\u2013oxide\u2013NbN junction with the dimensions of 2.5\u00d7\n150\u00b5m2. A propagating fluxon can be captured at any desired position in the effective potential\nwell created by placing a resistor on the surface of a portion of the long Josephson junction.\nThe surface resistor has a length larger than the Josephson penetration depth \u03bbJ. The NbN\nfilm used in the experiment has a London penetration depth \u03bbL of about 290 nm. Meanwhile\n\u03bbJ is estimated to be 4\u00b5m. The dimensions of the surface resistor used to capture the fluxon\nare 2.5\u00d7 20\u00b5m2. So the length of the resistor should be 20\u00b5m. The current density J0 of\nthis Josephson junction is 2 kA cm\u22122. It is well known that the fluxon dynamics is very well\ndescribed by the behaviour of kink-solitons [15]. A Josephson pulse generator at the input side\nof the junction generates a fluxon. A latching current Ir supplied from a SQUID connected to\nthe resistor can re-drive the captured fluxon. Once a fluxon has been captured in the potential\nwell, a fluxon should be observable on the output side after supplying a current of Ir = 0.11mA.\nThis would indicate that the fluxon had escaped from the potential well.\nNew Journal of Physics 10 (2008) 113015 (http:\/\/www.njp.org\/)\n18\nThe length of the resistor defines the width of the potential well. We estimate that for\nresistor lengths of the order of 6\u00b5m and a supply current Ir of the order of 0.1mA, fluxon\ntunnelling should be observable. On the other hand, for resistor lengths of the order of 30\u00b5m,\ntunnelling would be impossible. In this latter case, for supply currents of the order of 1mA it\nshould be possible to observe an escaping fluxon due to a fluxon\u2013antifluxon pair creation.\nThe supply current here is proportional to the absolute value of the slope of the potential\nV (x) in figure 1 for x <\u2212d or, in other terms, to the absolute value of F(x) given by\nequation (9) for x <\u2212d.\n4.5. Domain wall tunnelling\nRecently, there has been much interest in the macroscopic tunnelling of domain walls\n[9, 10, 32], e.g. those trapped by crystal defects in a magnet. Usually tunnelling phenomena\nare studied as purely quantum effects that should occur at very low temperatures. In general,\ncalculations show the probability to be very small [9, 10, 32]. Our results show however that,\nunder the right conditions, escape will occur with certainty.\nOne experimental manifestation of the macroscopic tunnelling of domain walls is that the\nrate of the magnetization relaxation processes does not decrease to zero when the temperature\nis reduced, but maintains a finite value, independent of temperature [3, 7].\nThe present results suggest that very large domain walls should show not only the\nmacroscopic tunnelling but also the Hawking emission. Other systems with topologically\ncoherent structures, e.g. vortices and spiral waves [33], may be expected to behave similarly.\nSuch phenomena should in principle be observable. In particular, it is in principle possible\nto build a long Josephson junction, with an inhomogeneous perturbation like the one studied\nhere, where the kink escape could be observed [34]. The perturbation F(x) can be readily\nimplemented through an applied magnetic field to push the domain wall off the defect [10].\nThis experimental setup has already been used to study ratchets with a moving kink in a medium\nwith potential wells and barriers. Thus, the implementation of the appropriate barrier will not\nbe a problem. The escape of the kink will be reflected in the electrical performance of the\njunction.\n5. Conclusion\nWe have shown that the Hawking radiation phenomenon is not restricted to the vicinity of black\nholes, as had been assumed. Rather, it is a more widespread phenomenon that can occur even in\ncondensed matter systems. Our theory of the process is dynamical, and we can follow in detail\nwhat happens in simulations. We point to an experiment with a long Josephson junction where\nwe believe that this phenomenon can be observed and where we suspect that it may already have\nbeen observed [31], albeit without full appreciation of what was occurring.\nAcknowledgments\nWe acknowledge support of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (UK).\nOne of us (JAG) is grateful to the Royal Society of London for funding his visit to Lancaster.\nNew Journal of Physics 10 (2008) 113015 (http:\/\/www.njp.org\/)\n19\nReferences\n[1] Kramers H A 1940 Physica 7 284\n[2] Dykman M I and Krivoglaz M A 1984 Soviet Physics Reviews vol 5, ed I M Khalatnikov (New York:\nHarwood) pp 265\u2013441\n[3] Hanggi P, Talkner P and Borkovec M 1990 Rev.
