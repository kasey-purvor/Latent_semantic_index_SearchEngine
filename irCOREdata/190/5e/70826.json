The\nprocedure used consists of stabilizing an unstable periodic\norbit by the application of precisely designed small perturba-\ntions to a parameter and\/or a trajectory of the chaotic system.\nDifferent methods of chaos control have been suggested and\napplied in many different physical contexts, as well as nu-\nmerically to model systems @1#. For practical applications of\nthese control methods, it is important to understand how\nnoise influences the stabilization process, because fluctua-\ntions are inherent and inevitably present in dissipative sys-\ntems. The problem has not been well studied. Typically, a\nmethod is developed for stabilization of the orbit without\ninitially taking any account of fluctuations. Only then do the\nauthors check the robustness of their method by introducing\nweak noise into the system @1#. Thus, in the celebrated pio-\nneering work of Ott, Grebogi, and York, in Ref. @2#, the\nauthors just noted that noise can induce failures of stabiliza-\ntion.\nIn several works @3,4#, methods are developed for the sta-\nbilization of unstable orbits in the presence of noise. They\nare based on a strong feedback approach to suppress any\ndeviation from the stabilized states. There are also methods\n@5# that use noise to move the system to a desired unstable\nstate, and then stabilize it there.\nIn this work we consider noise-induced failures in the\nstabilization of an unstable orbit and the problem of control-\nling these failures. The method of Ott, Grebogi, and Yorke\n~OGY! @2# and a modification of the adaptive method ~ADP!\n@1# are used to stabilize an unstable point of the logistic map.\nWe consider the small noise limit where stabilization failures\nare very rare and they can therefore be considered as large\nfluctuations ~deviations! from a stable state. We study the\nproperties of large deviations by determining the optimal\npaths and the optimal fluctuational forces corresponding to\nthe failures. We employ two methods to determine the opti-\nmal paths and forces. The first of these methods builds and\nanalyzes the prehistory probability distribution @6#. The sec-\nond method considers an extended map ~relative to the initial\none! which defines fluctuational paths and forces in the zero-\nnoise limit @7,8#. Furthermore, we use the optimal paths and1063-651X\/2003\/67~5!\/051102~11!\/$20.00 67 0511forces to develop methods of controlling the large deviations,\ni.e., the noise-induced failures of stabilization @9#.\nIn Sec. I we describe the procedures for local and global\nstabilizations of an unstable orbit of the logistic map. The\ngeneral approach to the control of a large deviation is pre-\nsented in Sec. II. Noise-induced failures of local and global\nstabilizations are considered in Secs. III and IV, respectively.\nThe results obtained are discussed in the Conclusion.\nI. CHAOS STABILIZATION\nFor simplicity we will stabilize an unstable fixed point x*\nof the logistic map:\nxn115rxn~12xn!, ~1!\nwhere xn is a coordinate, n is discrete time and r is the\ncontrol parameter that determines different regimes of the\nmap\u2019s behavior ~1!. The coordinate of the fixed point x* is\ndefined by the condition: xn115xn , and consequently its\nlocation depends on the parameter r:\nx*512\n1\nr\n. ~2!\nWe set the parameter r53.8, a value for which an aperiodic\n~chaotic! regime is observed ~1!, and the point x* is embed-\nded in the chaotic attractor.\nFrom the range of existing stabilization methods, we\nchose to work with just two: the OGY and ADP methods\nmentioned above.\nTo stabilize a fixed point by the OGY method, perturba-\ntions Dr are applied to the parameter r, leading to the map\nbeing modified ~1! in the following manner:\nxn115~r1Drn!xn~12xn!,\nDrn5r\n~2x*21 !~xn2x*!\nx*~12x*!\n. ~3!\nTo stabilize a fixed point by the ADP method, perturba-\ntions Dx are applied to the map\u2019s coordinate. The value of\nthe perturbation Dx is defined by the distance between the\ncurrent system coordinate and the coordinate of the stabi-\nlized state:\u00a92003 The American Physical Society02-1\nKHOVANOV, KHOVANOVA, AND MCCLINTOCK PHYSICAL REVIEW E 67, 051102 ~2003!xn115rxn~12xn!1Dxn ,\nDxn5~xn2x*!. ~4!\nThe ADP method is simple to use in practice. Different\nmodifications of the adaptive method are therefore used in\nmany papers devoted to experiments on the control of chaos.\nWe consider two types of stabilization procedure: local\nstabilization and global stabilization.\nDuring local stabilization, the perturbations Dr and Dx\ndiffer from zero only if the following condition is satisfied:\nuxn2x*u,e . ~5!\nHere e is a small value: we fixed e50.01. If condition ~5! is\nnot satisfied then stabilization is absent, i.e., Dr50 or Dx\n50.\nDuring global stabilization perturbations are switched on\nwhen condition ~5! is satisfied for the first time, and remain\npresent for all future time.\nSo, local or global stabilization involve modifications of\nthe initial map ~1!, and thus use another map in the form ~3!\nor ~4!. The fixed point x* is an attractor of the new map.\nAfter the stabilization is switched on, a trajectory of the map\ntends to the fixed point x*, and subsequently remains there.\nIn the presence of noise the trajectory fluctuates in the\nvicinity of the stabilized state, i.e., noise-induced dynamics\nappears. In addition, noise can induce stabilization failures.\nFor local stabilization they imply a breakdown in condition\n~5!, and for global stabilization they correspond to an escape\nof the trajectory from the basin of attraction of the fixed\npoint x*.\nOur aim is to study these noise-induced stabilization fail-\nures and analyze the problem of how to suppress them. We\ntherefore consider maps ~3! and ~4! in the presence of addi-\ntive Gaussian fluctuations,\nxn115~r1Drn!xn~12xn!1Djn ,\nDrn5r\n~2x*21 !~xn2x*!\nx*~12x*!\n, ~6!\nxn115rxn~12xn!1Dxn1Djn ,\nDxn5~xn2x*!. ~7!\nHere D is the noise intensity; and jn is a Gaussian random\nprocess with zero average ^j&50, d-correlation function\n^jnjn1k&5d(k), and dispersion ^j2&51. We use a high-\nspeed noise generator @10#.\nII. CONTROL OF LARGE FLUCTUATIONS\nLarge fluctuations manifest themselves as large deviations\nfrom the stable state of the system under the action of fluc-\ntuational forces. Large fluctuations play a key role in many\nphenomena, ranging from mutations in DNA to failures of\nelectrical devices. In recent years significant progress has\nbeen achieved both in understanding the physical nature of\nlarge fluctuations and in developing approaches for describ-05110ing them. The latter are based on the concept of optimal\npaths\u2014the paths along which the system moves during large\nfluctuations. Large fluctuations are very rare events during\nwhich the system moves from the vicinity of a stable state to\na state remote from it, at a distance significantly larger than\nthe amplitude of the noise. Such deviations can correspond\nto a transition of the system to another state, or to an excur-\nsion along some trajectory away from the stable state and\nthen back again. During such deviations the system is moved\nwith overwhelming probability along the optimal path under\nthe action of a specific ~optimal! fluctuational force. The\nprobability of motion along any other ~nonoptimal! path is\nexponentially smaller. In practice, therefore large fluctuations\nmust necessarily occur along deterministic trajectories. The\nproblem of controlling large fluctuations can thus be reduced\nto the task of controlling motion along a deterministic trajec-\ntory. Consequently, the control problem can be solved\nthrough application of the control methods developed for\ndeterministic systems @11#.\nLet us consider the control problem. Formally, the task\nthat we face in controlling noise-induced large fluctuations\nconsists of writing a functional R, the extrema of which cor-\nrespond to optimal solutions of the control problem, i.e., so-\nlutions with minimal required energy @12\u201314#. The form of\nthe functional R depends on a number of different additional\nconditions related to, e.g., the system dynamics, the energy\nof the control force, or the time during which it is applied\n@12\u201314#. We will follow the work @13# and consider the con-\ntrol of large fluctuations by a weak additive deterministic\ncontrol force. Weakness means here that the energy of the\ncontrol force is comparable with the energy ~dispersion! of\nthe fluctuations ~see Ref. @12# for details!. In this case, the\nextremal value of the functional R for optimal control, which\nmoves the system from an initial state xi to a target state x f ,\ntakes the form @13#\nRopt~x f ,F !5S (0)~x f !6DS ,\nDS5~2F !F (\nk5Ni\nN f\n~jk\nopt!2G , ~8!\nwhere jk\nopt is the optimal fluctuational force that induces the\ntransition from xi to x f in the absence of the control force;\nS (0) is an energy of the transition, Ni and N f are the times at\nwhich the fluctuational force jk\nopt starts and stops @15#, and F\nis a parameter defining the energy of the control force.\nThe optimal control force un\nopt for the given functional ~8!\nis defined @13# by\nun\nopt57~2F !1\/2jn\noptF (\nk5Ni\nk5N f\n~jk\nopt!2G 1\/2d~xn2xn(0)opt!, ~9!\nwhere xn\n(0)opt is the optimal fluctuational path in the absence\nof the control force. The minus sign in expression ~9! de-\ncreases the probability of a transition to the state x f , and the\nplus sign increases the probability. It can be seen ~9! that the\noptimal control force un\nopt is completely defined by the opti-\nmal fluctuational force jk\nopt\n, and the optimal fluctuational2-2\nNOISE-INDUCED FAILURES OF CHAOS . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW E 67, 051102 ~2003!path xn\n(0)opt\n, corresponds to the large fluctuation. Therefore,\nto solve the control problem it is necessary, first, to deter-\nmine the optimal path xn\n(0)opt leading from the state xi to the\nstate x f under the action of the optimal fluctuational force\njk\nopt\n. Thus, a solution of the control problem depends on the\nexistence of an optimal path: it is obvious that the approach\ndescribed should be straightforward to apply, provided that\nthe optimal path exists and is unique.\nWe consider below an application of the approach de-\nscribed to suppress large fluctuations in the one-dimensional\nmap. The large fluctuations in question are considered here\nto correspond to failures in the stabilization of an unstable\norbit.\nThe control procedure depends on the determination of\nthe optimal path and optimal fluctuational force and, to de-\nfine them, we will use two different methods. The first is\nbased on an analysis of the prehistory probability distribution\n~PPD! and the second one consists of solving a boundary\nproblem for an extended map which defines fluctuational tra-\njectories.\nThe PPD was introduced in Ref. @6# to analyze optimal\npaths experimentally in flow systems. We will use the distri-\nbution to analyze fluctuational paths in maps. Note, that in\nRefs. @16,17# it was shown that the analysis of the PPD al-\nlows one to determine both the optimal path and the optimal\nfluctuational force. The essence of this first method consists\nof a determination of the fluctuational trajectories corre-\nsponding to large fluctuations for extremely small ~but finite!\nnoise intensity, followed by a statistical analysis of the tra-\njectories. In this experimental method, the behavior of the\ndynamical variables xn and of the random force jn are\ntracked continuously until the system makes its transition\nfrom an initial state xi to a small vicinity of the target state\nx f . Escape trajectories xnesc reaching this state, and the corre-\nsponding noise realizations jn\nesc of the same duration, are\nthen stored. The system is then reset to the initial state xi and\nthe procedure is repeated. Thus, an ensemble of trajectories\nis collected and then the fluctuational PPD pn\nh is constructed\nfor the time interval during which the system is monitored.\nThis distribution contains all information about the temporal\nevolution of the system immediately before the trajectory\narrives at the final state x f . The existence of an optimal es-\ncape path is diagnosed by the form of the PPD pn\nh : if there is\nan optimal escape trajectory, then the distribution pnh at a\ngiven time n has a sharp peak at optimal trajectory xnopt .\nTherefore, to find an optimal path it is necessary to build the\nPPD and, for each moment of time n, to check for the pres-\nence of a distinct narrow peak in the PPD. The width of the\npeak defines the dispersion sn\nh of the distribution and it has\nto be of the order of the mean-square noise amplitude AD\n@6#. The optimal fluctuational force that moves the system\ntrajectory along the optimal path can be estimated by aver-\naging the corresponding noise realizations jn\nesc over the en-\nsemble. Note, that investigations of the fluctuational prehis-\ntory also allows us to determine the range of system\nparameters for which optimal paths exist.\nTo determine the optimal path and force by means of the\nsecond method we analyze extended maps @7,8# using the05110principle of least action @8#. Such extended maps are analo-\ngous to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation in the theory of large\nfluctuations for flow systems. For the one-dimensional map\nxn115 f (xn)1Djn , the corresponding extended map in the\nzero-noise limit takes the form\nxn115 f ~xn!1yn \/g~xn!,\nyn115yn \/g~xn!,\ng~xn!5\n] f ~xn!\n]xn\n. ~10!\nThe map is area preserving, and it defines the dynamics of\nthe noise-free map xn115 f (xn), if yn50. If yn\u00de0 then the\ncoordinate xn corresponds to a fluctuational path, and the\ncoordinate yn to a fluctuational force. Stable and unstable\nstates of the initial map become saddle states of the extended\nmap. So, the fixed point x* of the ADP ~7! and OGY ~6!\nmaps becomes a saddle point of the corresponding extended\nmap. Fluctuational trajectories ~including the optimal one!\nstarting from x* belong to unstable manifolds of the fixed\npoint (x*,0) of the extended map.\nThe procedure for determination of the optimal paths con-\nsists of solving the boundary problem for the extended map\n~10!:\nx2\u20185x*, y2\u201850, ~11!\nx\u20185x\nf\n, y\u201850, ~12!\nwhere x* is the initial state and x f is a target state.\nTo solve the boundary problem different methods can be\nused. For the one-dimensional maps under consideration, a\nsimple shooting method is enough @18#. We choose an initial\nperturbation l along the linearized unstable manifolds in a\nvicinity of the point (x*,0) of map ~10!. The procedure to\ndetermine a solution can be as follows: looking over all pos-\nsible values l, we determine a trajectory which tends to the\npoint (x f ,0). Note that, because these maps are irreversible\nthere exist, in general, an infinite number of solutions of the\nboundary problem. The optimal trajectory ~path! has minimal\naction ~energy! S5(n52\u2018\n\u2018 yn\n2 ; here yn is calculated along the\ntrajectory, corresponding to a solution of the boundary task.\nIII. NOISE-INDUCED FAILURES IN LOCAL\nSTABILIZATION\nA breakdown of condition ~5! corresponds to a failure of\nlocal stabilization, i.e., to the noise-induced escape of the\ntrajectory from an e vicinity of the fixed point x*. The target\nstate x f corresponds to the boundaries of the stabilization\nregion: x f5x*6e .\nInstead of analyzing the maps ~6! and ~7! in the e vicinity\nof the fixed point x*, we can investigate linearized maps of\nthe following form:\nxn115axn1Djn ; ~13!2-3\nKHOVANOV, KHOVANOVA, AND MCCLINTOCK PHYSICAL REVIEW E 67, 051102 ~2003!here a is a value of derivative ] f (xn)\/]xn in the fixed point\nx*. For map ~6! the derivative is equal to zero aOGY50, and\nfor map ~7! aADP520.8.\nLet us investigate stabilization failure by considering the\nmost probable ~optimal! fluctuational paths, which lead from\nthe point x* to boundaries x*6e . For linearized maps ~13!\nthe extended map ~10! can be reduced to the form:\nxn115axn1\nyn\na\n,\nyn115\nyn\na\n, ~14!\nwith the initial condition (x05x*,y050) and the final con-\ndition x f5x*6e . It can be seen that a solution of map ~14!\nincreases proportionally to yn5const\/an @19#. This means\nthat, for the ADP map ~7!, the amplitude of the fluctuational\nforce increases slowly but that, for the OGY map ~6!, the\nfailure arises as the result of only one fluctuation ~iteration!.\nBecause Eq. ~14! is linear, the boundary problem will have a\nunique solution @18#. Thus, the analysis of the linearized ex-\ntended map ~14! shows that there is an optimal path and it\ngives a qualitative picture of exit through the boundary x*\n6e .\nLet us check the existence of the optimal paths through an\nanalysis of the prehistory of fluctuations. To obtain exit tra-\njectories and noise realizations we use the following proce-\ndure. At the initial moment of time, a trajectory of the map is\nlocated at point x*. The subsequent behavior of the trajec-\ntory is monitored until the moment at which it exits from the\ne region of the point x*. The relevant part of the trajectory,\njust before and after its exit, are stored. The time at which the\nexit occurs is set to zero. Thus, ensembles of exit trajectories\nand of the corresponding noise realizations are collected and\nPPDs are built.\nTo start with, we will discuss these ideas in the context of\nthe ADP map. Figure 1~a! shows PPDs of the escape trajec-\ntories of the ADP map, and the corresponding noise realiza-\ntions for the exit through the boundary (x*2e) are shown in\nFig. 1~b!. The picture of exit through the other boundary\n(x*1e) is symmetrical, so we present results for one bound-\nary only. It is evident ~Fig. 1! that there is the only one exit\npath. Note, that the path to the boundary (x*2e) is approxi-\nmately 2.8 times more probable than the path to the bound-\nary (x*1e). This difference arises from an asymmetry of\nthe map in respect of the boundaries.\nBecause for each boundary there is the only one exit path,\nthe optimal path and the optimal fluctuational force can be\ndetermined by simple averaging of escape trajectories and\nnoise realizations, respectively. In Fig. 2 the optimal exit\npaths and the optimal fluctuational forces are shown for the\nboundaries (x*2e) and (x*1e). The paths and the forces\ncoincide with a solution of the boundary problem ~circles in\nthe Fig. 2! of the extended linear map ~14!. The time depen-\ndence of the dispersion sn\nh of PPDs for the exit trajectories\nand noise realizations are shown in Fig. 3. As can be seen\n~Fig. 2! the optimal path is long, and the amplitude of the\nfluctuational force increases slowly, in agreement with the05110analysis of the linearized map ~14!. The dispersion sn\nh of\nboth trajectories and noise realizations decreases by con-\nstruction as the boundary is achieved ~Fig. 3!.\nThe optimal fluctuational force obtained @Fig. 2~b!# must\ncorrespond @17# to the energy-optimal deterministic force\nthat induced the stabilization failure. We have checked this\nprediction and found that the optimal force induces the exit\nfrom an e region of the point x*: we selected an initial\ncondition at the point x* and included the optimal fluctua-\ntional force additively; as a result we observed the stabiliza-\ntion failure. If we decrease the amplitude of the force by\n5\u201310%, then the failure does not occur. It appears, therefore,\nthe deduced force allows us to induce the stabilization failure\nwith minimal energy ~see Ref. @17# for details!.\nUsing the optimal path and the force we can solve the\nopposite task @12,13#\u2014to decrease the probability of the sta-\nbilization failures. Indeed, if during the motion along the\noptimal path we will apply a control force with the same\namplitude but with the opposite sign as the optimal fluctua-\ntional force has, then, obviously, the failure will not occur.\nFIG. 1.

PHYSICAL REVIEW E 67, 051102 ~2003!Because we know the optimal force then, in accordance with\nthe algorithm @13# described above, it is necessary to deter-\nmine the time moment when the system is moving along the\noptimal path.

NOISE-INDUCED FAILURES OF GLOBAL\nSTABILIZATION\nTo investigate fluctuational dynamics in the global stabi-\nlization regime, we consider the dynamics of the maps ~6!\nand ~7! with initial conditions at the fixed point x05x*. We\nwill first consider them in the absence of noise. The maps are\nshown on the plane xn2xn11 in Fig. 6.\nThe map ~6! @Fig. 6~a!# has three fixed points of period\none: the point x*\u20190.7368 is stable with the multiplier m\n50; the points x2*50 and x1*\u20190.5906 are unstable with\nmultipliers m\u201923.04 and m\u20191.8016, respectively. The\nmap has two attractors: the point x* and the attractor at\ninfinity @20#. Their basins of attraction @Fig. 6~a!# are self-\nsimilar ~fractal! @21,22#. The point x1* and its preimages by\nbackward iteration lie on the basin boundaries of the attrac-\ntors @23#. In the intervals xP(20.183,0.5906) and x\nP(0.862,1.027) the basins of the attractors alternate and are\nof different length. The interval xP(0.5906,0.862) corre-\nsponds to the widest basin of the fixed point x*. The bound-\naries of this basin are defined by the unstable point x1* and its\npreimage x1\nI* . The semi-infinite intervals xP(2\u2018 ,\nFIG. 5. For the OGY map, the optimal path ~a! and the optimal\nforce ~b! are shown for exit through the boundary (x*2e) ~crosses!\nand the boundary (x*1e) ~circles!.2-6\nNOISE-INDUCED FAILURES OF CHAOS . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW E 67, 051102 ~2003!20.183) and xP(1.027,\u2018) correspond to basins of the at-\ntractor at infinity. The boundaries of the semi-infinite inter-\nvals are defined by the points x2\u2018520.183 and x\u2018\n51.027, which correspond to the cycle of period 2.\nThe map ~7! @Fig. 6~b!# has two fixed points: the point\nx*\u20190.7368 is stable with multiplier m\u201920.8; and the point\nx1*\u20190.2632 is unstable with multiplier m\u20192.8. The map has\ntwo attractors: the fixed point x* and the attractor at infinity.\nThe basins of attraction are smooth @Fig. 6~b!#. The first\nboundary of the basins is the point x1* and the second bound-\nary is a preimage x1\nI* of the point x1* .\nSo, each of the maps has two attractors, but the structure\nof their basins of attraction are qualitatively different.\nWe now consider these maps ~6! and ~7! in the presence\nof noise. Noise can induce escape from the basin of the fixed\npoint x*, corresponding to failure of the stabilization. As\nFIG. 6. The OGY map ~a! and the ADP map ~b! on the plane\n(xn2xn11) are shown by the thick solid line. Basins of attraction of\nthe fixed point x* ~white regions! and the attractor at infinity ~black\nregions! are shown at the bottoms of the figures. The dashed lines\nindicate locations of the fixed points of the maps and the points\ndefining the basin boundaries. Escape trajectories are shown by\ndots. The thin line in ~b! corresponds to the optimal path.05110before, we examine the dynamics of the escape trajectories\nobtained for extremely small noise intensity in order to de-\ntermine the optimal path and the optimal force. Fluctuational\nescape trajectories of map ~7! are shown by dots on the plane\n(xn2xn11) in Fig. 6~b!. As can be seen, there is one escape\npath, and the escape trajectories pass through the unstable\npoint x1* . In Fig. 7 the optimal path and the optimal force\nobtained by averaging the escape trajectories and noise real-\nizations, respectively, are shown by crosses. The stabilization\nfailure clearly possesses a long prehistory. From the point of\nview of the control procedure, the presence of a large devia-\ntion of the system coordinate ^xn& at the time moment n5\n21, and the smaller deviation of the fluctuational force ^jn&\nat the next time moment (n50), are important.This is be-\ncause the first fluctuation of coordinate xn can easily be iden-\ntified and distinguished from nonoptimal fluctuations in the\nvicinity of the stable state x*.\nNext, we examine the process of escape for map ~6!. Fig-\nure 8~a! shows escape trajectories superposed at the time\nmoment when the trajectory crosses the basin boundary at\nthe point x2\u2018. It is evident that there is no selected escape\nFIG. 7.

The escape trajectories can be divided into several\ngroups with different probabilities. With maximum probabil-\nity ~almost 50%! the escape trajectories follow the arrowed\npath in Fig. 8~a! corresponding to motion in the direction of\nthe point x2\u2018 without any jumps in the opposite direction.\nThe other paths include jumps in the opposite direction. The\nwidth of the distribution of fluctuational paths is comparable\nwith the noise amplitude and there is no specific fluctuational\nforce. In Fig. 6~a! the escape trajectories are shown on the\nplane (xn2xn11). It can be seen that, after the point x1* , the\nescape trajectories are located close to the trajectories of de-\nterministic map, so we can suppose that after the point x1* the\nmotion has the character of directed diffusion. The interval\nbetween the points x1* and x2\u2018 lies within the fractal basin,\nFIG. 8. 100 escape trajectories of the OGY map collected in a\nvicinity of ~a! the point x2\u2018 and ~b! the point x1* . The size of the\nvicinity is defined as the mean square of noise intensity D. The\ndash-dotted lines indicate the location of the boundary point x1* and\nits preimage x1\nI* ; the dashed lines in ~a! represent boundaries of the\nbasins with fractal structure, i.e., of the points x2\u2018 and x\u2018. The\nthick lines in ~b! correspond to different escape paths; the gray dots\nare coordinates of escape trajectories. The noise intensity is D\n50.018.05110and this fact implies a variety of escape paths. Indeed, within\na small vicinity of the point x1* there is a piece of basin of the\nattractor at infinity. For escape, therefore, it is enough to\nbring the trajectory only to this basin. However, the size of\nthis basin is small and a weak fluctuation can of course move\nthe trajectory back to the basin of point x* and vice versa. As\na result, the trajectory can spend a long time in the vicinity of\nthe point x1* : it can return to the point x*, as well as escape\nfrom the basin of the point x*.\nThus, the fractal structure in the basin of attraction leads\nto complex behavior of the escape trajectories; they can\nspend a long time in the fractal basin; motion in the direction\nof the attractor at infinity has the largest probability.\nInvestigations of escape from the point x* to the vicinity\nof the point x1* have shown @Fig. 8~b!#, that there is no spe-\ncific path within this interval, so that we cannot determine\nthe optimal path or the optimal force using an analysis of the\nescape trajectories. It is possible to select several different\nfavored paths @thick lines in the Fig. 8~b!#, but dispersion of\nthe trajectories for each of them is much larger than the noise\nintensity used.\nWe now determine the escape optimal paths and the\nforces by solving the boundary problems ~11! and ~12! for\nthe extended maps:\nxn115 f ~xn!1yn \/g~xn!,\nyn115yn \/g~xn!,\nf ~xn!5~r1Drn!xn~12xn!,\ng~xn!5\n] f ~xn!\n]xn\n~16!\nand\nxn115 f ~xn!1yn \/g~xn!,\nyn115yn \/g~xn!,\nf ~xn!5rxn~12xn!1Dxn ,\ng~xn!5\n] f ~xn!\n]xn\n, ~17!\nwhich correspond to maps ~6! and ~7!. In such a way we\nhave used the extended map ~14! to analyze the linearized\nmap ~13!.\nFirst, we consider the results of solving the boundary\nproblem for the extended map ~16!. To do so, we use a shoot-\ning method, with boundary conditions ~11! and ~12!, where\nx f5x1* . Since the derivative g(xn)5] f (xn)\/]xn of map ~6!\nat the point x* is equal to zero, we cannot calculate eigen-\nvectors of the point (x*,0) of map ~16!. Therefore, as a pa-\nrameter of the boundary problem we choose an initial pertur-\nbation y0, since it defines all the trajectories going away\nfrom the point (x*,0). Four solutions of the boundary prob-\nlem, obtained numerically, are found to have practically the\nsame action S. Four escape paths and noise realizations (t12-8\nNOISE-INDUCED FAILURES OF CHAOS . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW E 67, 051102 ~2003!2t4) of map ~16! corresponding to these solutions are shown\nin Fig. 9. The trajectory t4 has the minimum activation en-\nergy S\u20190.0115 and the energies of other trajectories are\npractically the same: S\u20190.0123. All the optimal trajectories\nlie on a stable manifold of the point (x1*,0), and the stable\nmanifold goes to the point (x*,0) ~Fig. 10!. If we take into\naccount the fact that the noise intensity is finite during the\nexperimental analysis of escape trajectories ~Fig. 8!, then the\nfluctuational trajectories of the map ~6! form a wide bunch\naround the optimal paths and trajectories can go along the\ndifferent optimal paths at different time intervals. Thus, for\nthe OGY map ~6!, the only way to determine optimal paths\nand forces is by the solution of the boundary problem for the\nextended map, whereas an analysis of the PPD is not suc-\ncessful.\nNow, let us consider the solution of the boundary problem\nfor map ~17!. We have defined an unstable direction of the\npoint (x*,0) and used the length of a vector l along this\ndirection as a parameter of the boundary problem. There is\njust one solution for which the value of action S50.0449,\nwhich is slightly smaller than the value S50.0493 calculated\nby using the PPD. The corresponding optimal path and opti-\nFIG. 9.

The path t1 is\nmarked with s; t2 , h; t3 , 3; t4 , 1.05110mal force are shown in Fig. 7 together with the path and the\nforce found by using the PPD. It can be seen ~Fig. 7!, that the\noptimal paths and the forces obtained by the calculated PPD\nand by using the extended map are practically the same.\nThus, we have defined the optimal path and the optimal\nforce corresponding to global stabilization failures, and we\nhave compared two methods for determination of the optimal\npath and force: the first method being based on an experi-\nmental analysis of the prehistory probability distribution, and\nthe second one being based on solving the boundary problem\nfor an extended area-preserving map. The latter method al-\nlows us to determine the optimal path and force for both the\nmaps ~6! and ~7!, whereas the experimental analysis of pre-\nhistory probability is only successful for ADP map ~7!.\nBecause there is no unique escape path for the OGY map,\nit is impossible to apply the algorithm described above for\ncontrolling stabilization failures. We note, however, that,\nsince we know the dynamics of the fluctuational trajectories,\nit is still possible to realize control of the fluctuations by\nusing another approach. For example, a control force can be\nadded whenever the system comes to the vicinity of the point\nx1* . In this case, however, the size of the vicinity and the\nmagnitude and form of the control force are ill defined.\nFor stabilization of the ADP map, the opposite situation\napplies: there exist an unique optimal path and a correspond-\ning optimal force. Consequently, we can realize a procedure\nfor the control of large fluctuations. It is similar to that de-\nscribed above for local control. We monitor trajectories of\nmap ~7! to identify the large deviation (^xn&, n521 in Fig.\n7!, and in the next iteration we add the control force un5\n2^jn&, n50. The dependences on noise intensity D of the\nmean time ^t& between stabilization failures in the absence\nand in the presence of control are shown in Fig. 11~a!. The\ndependence of ^t& on the amplitude of the control force is\nshown in Fig. 11~b!. The suggested control procedure is evi-\ndently effective.\nFIG. 10.

In our investigations, they correspond to\nlarge deviations from stable points. We have examined two\ntypes of stabilization, local and global, and therefore ana-\nlyzed fluctuational deviations of different size. We have\nshown that, for local stabilization, noise-induced failures can\nbe analyzed effectively in terms of linearized noisy maps.\nLarge noise-induced deviations from the fixed point in\none-dimensional maps have been analyzed within the frame-\nwork of the theory of large fluctuations. The key point of our\nconsideration is that the dynamics of the optimal path, and\nthe optimal fluctuational force, correspond directly to stabi-\nlization failures. We have applied two approaches\u2014\nexperimental analysis of the prehistory probability distribu-\ntion and the solution of the boundary problem for extended\nmaps\u2014to determine the optimal path and the optimal fluc-\nFIG. 11. ~a!

For local\nstabilization, the two approaches give the same results. For\nglobal stabilization, however, the solution of the boundary\nproblem enabled the optimal path and optimal fluctuational\nforce to be determined for both the OGY and ADP maps,\nwhereas investigation of fluctuations\u2019 prehistory gave the op-\ntimal path and force for the ADP map only.\nA procedure for the control of large fluctuations in one-\ndimensional maps has been demonstrated. It is based on the\ncontrol concept developed in Ref. @13# for continuous sys-\ntems. We have introduced an additional control scheme\nwhich significantly improves the stabilization of an unstable\norbit in the presence of noise. It was successful for the ADP\nmethod of stabilization, and problematic for the OGY\nmethod. We have shown that the control procedure has limi-\ntations connected with the existence of unique optimal path\nand the presence of long time prehistory of large fluctuation.\nThe relationships between the large fluctuation dynamics and\nthe control procedures are summarized in Table I.\nOur consideration of the control problem is relevant to a\ncontinuous system which has a one-dimensional curve in its\nPoincare\u00b4 section, e.g., the Rossler system. For such systems\nwe can formulate the control task as that of control at dis-\ncrete moments of time ~the moments of intersection of the\nPoincare\u00b4 section! by using impulsive forces. The intervals\nbetween these moments were used to calculate and to form\nthe necessary control force. Note that a similar approach is\nwidely used in control technology.\nThe main limitation of our present control approach lies\nin the necessity of studying the fluctuational dynamics of a\ngiven system prior to consideration of its control. Such a\nstudy can be carried out by the use of an extended map of the\nsystem, if model equations are known, and\/or experimentally\nby the analysis of the fluctuational prehistory distribution.\nFor local stabilization, a system model can be easily written\ndown by determination of the eigenvalue of a stabilized un-\nstable point: there are many effective methods of doing so\n@24#. For global stabilization, however, there is no compa-\nrable method and we need to investigate the fluctuational\nprehistory. Our investigations have shown that, in this case,\nwe can meet problems in the determination of the control\nforce. Indeed, we have shown that, for global stabilization of\nthe OGY map, there are several most-probable escape paths\nwith practically the same energy. As the result, a real escape\npath can be a combination of the different most-probable\npaths, so that an escape trajectory does not necessarily follow\na defined path as for the ADP map. Furthermore, we cannot\ndetermine the fluctuational force or, correspondingly, the\nTABLE I.

So our\ncontrol procedure is then inapplicable. It is obvious that, for\nsuccessful control of such systems, we must change the con-\ntrol strategy. For example, we can try to predict a fluctua-\ntional force locally, in contrast to the scheme described\nabove where we try to know the full fluctuational dynamics.\nThe local prediction can be based on a combination of real\ntime prehistory analysis and reconstruction of the extended\nsystem @25#.\nAdditionally, noise-induced escape through fractal bound-\naries has been studied in a one-dimensional map. It was\nfound that fluctuational motion across fractal basins has a051102nonactivation character. It was also established that there are\nseveral optimal escape paths from the fixed point of the OGY\nmap ~6! whereas, for the ADP map ~7!, the escape path is\nunique. We infer that the existence of several paths in the\nOGY map ~6! is connected with the fact that the stable mani-\nfold of the boundary point (x1*,0) goes to the fixed point\n(x*,0).\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank D.G.
