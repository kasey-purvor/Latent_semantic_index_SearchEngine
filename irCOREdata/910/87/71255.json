This could enable control of optical confinement, car-\nrier leakage, intervalence band absorption, and Auger recom-\nbination. However, there have been very few reports on the\ngrowth and the luminescence properties of GaInAsSbP pen-\ntanary alloys.3,4 Recently, however, AlGaInAsSb alloys have\nbeen grown by molecular beam epitaxy and effectively used\nas the barrier layers in room temperature midinfrared quan-\ntum well lasers.5 Here we report on the liquid phase epitaxial\ngrowth of GaInAsSbP pentanary alloys and demonstrate\nroom temperature photoluminescence \u0002PL\u0003 in the 3\u20134 \u0002m\nspectral range.\nEpitaxial growth of pentanary GaInAsPSb single epilay-\ners was carried out from antimony-rich melts onto Ge doped\np-type GaSb \u0002100\u0003 substrates. Growth melts were prepared\nfrom 6N Sb and 7N In pure metals, while the sources of Ga,\nAs, and P were undoped polycrystalline GaSb, InAs, and InP\nbinary compounds. The use of antimony as the solvent for\nliquid phase epitaxy \u0002LPE\u0003 growth of GaSb-related alloys\nhas some advantages because it avoids substrate erosion and\nreduces the formation of Sb vacancies.6\u20138 Growth was imple-\nmented from supercooled melts at temperatures within the\ninterval of 585\u2013600 \u00b0C. In each case before the deposition\nof the GaInAsPSb pentanary alloy an undoped GaSb p-type\nbuffer layer was grown on the substrate. Structural charac-\nterization of the resulting epitaxial layers was done using\nphase contrast Nomarski microscopy, field emission electron\nmicroscopy, and high resolution x-ray diffraction. Subse-\nquent optical investigation of the GaInAsSbP structures in-\ncluded PL spectroscopy using an Ar+ ion laser \u0002514 nm\u0003\nwhich produced an excitation power density of 20 W cm\u22122\non the sample. Temperature dependent PL measurements\nover the range of 4\u2013300 K were carried out using conven-\ntional lock-in techniques. Additional measurements were\nmade with a Bruker IFS 66\/S Fourier transform infrared\nspectrometer and a 77 K InSb photodiode detector using a\nstep-scan and a lock-in technique to achieve better resolution\nat high temperatures.\nUsing a supercooling of \u0003T=8\u201315 \u00b0C, the thickness of\nthe resulting epilayers was found to be in the range of\n1.0\u20133.5 \u0002m. The GaInAsPSb epilayer surface morphology\nwas flat and mirrorlike when examined using Nomarski mi-\ncroscopy. High-resolution double crystal x-ray diffraction re-\nvealed that the lattice mismatch \u0003a \/a= \u00021.9\u20134.1\u0003\u000410\u22124\nat room temperature. The composition of the\nGa1\u2212xInxAsyPzSb1\u2212y\u2212z epitaxial layers was measured using\nenergy dispersive x-ray microanalysis \u0002EDAX\u0003. The alloy\ncompositions obtained are given in Table I together with the\ncorresponding spectral information. The compositional uni-\nformity in the growth direction was found to be approxi-\nmately constant within the limitations of the EDAX tech-\nnique \u0002\u00061% \u0003.\nThe PL emission spectra obtained at room temperature\nfrom single undoped pentanary epitaxial layers with different\nalloy compositions is shown in Fig. 1. A broad emission\nspectrum with a single peak was observed in all cases. \u0002Note\nthat the feature near 4.3 \u0002m arises from atmospheric absorp-\ntion of CO2 in the optical path.\u0003 The full width at half maxi-\na\u0003Electronic mail: a.krier@lancaster.ac.uk\nTABLE I.

Such PL broadening is\nassociated with alloy disorder and is often used as a semi-\nquantitative measure of the degree of phase separation.9 The\ntemperature dependence of the PL emission spectrum from\none of the layers \u0002S-886\u0003 is shown in Fig. 2. A small blue-\nshift is observed at low temperatures before the peak moves\nto longer wavelengths. The resulting temperature depen-\ndence of the principal peak is shown in Fig. 3. The solid line\nshows the resulting fit using the Varshni equation,6\nEg\u0002T\u0003 = Eg\u00020\u0003 \u2212 \u0005T2\/\u0002T + \u0006\u0003 , \u00021\u0003\nwhere Eg\u00020\u0003 is the energy gap at 0 K, and \u0005 and \u00df are the\ncorresponding thermal coefficients. The resulting curve is\ncharacteristic of recombination through localized states and\nhas been previously observed in AlGaAsSb alloys and\nAlAs\/GaAs disordered superlattices.7,10 Extrapolation of Eq.\n\u00021\u0003 to low temperature gives a value of 5 meV for the local-\nization energy. Alloys with different compositions exhibit\ncorrespondingly different behaviors with temperature consis-\ntent with the recombination of carriers from localized states\nat different energies. Introducing more P into the alloy pro-\nduces additional disorder and increases both the spectral\npeak width and localization energy \u000220 meV in S-947 com-\npared with 5 meV in S-923\u0003. We do not consider interface\nrecombination to be occurring since we did not observe dis-\ntinct transitions in the spectra at higher energy as reported for\nGaInAsSb\/GaSb \u0002Ref. 11\u0003 and the penetration depth of our\nAr+ ion laser is easily less than the epitaxial layer thickness.\nThe temperature dependence of the integrated PL emis-\nsion intensity in the range of 4\u2013300 K is shown in Fig. 4.\nThe data cannot be properly fitted by an Arrhenius plot. In-\nstead, the temperature dependence is similar to the behavior\nobserved in disordered crystalline or amorphous\nsemiconductors,12\nIPL = I0\/\u00041 + A exp\u0002T\/T0\u0003\u0005 , \u00022\u0003\nwhere IPL is the normalized peak intensity, T0 is the charac-\nteristic temperature associated with the ionization energy of\nlocalized states, A is a tunneling factor, and I0 is the PL\nintensity in the low temperature limit. Fitting using Eq. \u00022\u0003\nyields T0=32 K at low temperature. This indicates that the\nlocalization energy is approximately 3 meV. For tempera-\ntures higher than 100 K, carriers are thermally activated and\nbecome transferred to occupy other regions with deeper po-\ntential and stronger localization. Consequently, the character-\nistic temperature increases \u0002T0=102 K\u0003 corresponding to re-\ncombination from carriers localized in states 9 meV below\nthe mobility edge.\nBoth the temperature dependence of the PL peak wave-\nlength and emission intensity are consistent with recombina-\ntion through localized band tail states arising from electro-\nstatic potential fluctuations due to compositional\ninhomogeneities in these alloys.10,13 This is not surprising\nsince the alloys produced are close to the boundary of the\nmiscibility gap in this system. Our findings are similar to\nthose for quaternary AlGaAsSb lattice matched to InP, where\ncompositional modulation \u0002\u000615 nm\u0003 could only be observed\nusing high resolution transmission electron microscopy.13\nTight binding calculations of the band structure for pentanary\nalloys have shown that the addition of Ga or P to the alloy\nFIG. 1. \u0002Color online\u0003 PL emission spectra obtained from\nGa1\u2212xInxAsyPzSb1\u2212y\u2212z epitaxial layers at 300 K.\nFIG. 2. \u0002Color online\u0003 Temperature dependent PL spectra of one of the\npentanary epitaxial layers \u0002S-886\u0003 grown on GaSb by LPE.\nFIG. 3. \u0002Color online\u0003 Alloy energy gap variation with temperature for\nS-886 \u0002Ga0.03In0.97As0.81P0.06Sb0.13\u0003.\nFIG. 4. \u0002Color online\u0003 Temperature dependence of PL intensity measured\nfrom the sample in Fig. 3.\n082102-2 Krier et al.

Whereas, addition of Sb shifts the\nconduction band to lower energy without changing the den-\nsity of states.8 We suppose therefore that most of the local-\nization effects observed in the PL could be attributed mainly\nto local variations in the Sb\/P ratio. In spite of localization\neffects these alloys exhibit efficient photoluminescence at\nroom temperature covering the 3\u20134 \u0002m wavelength range\nmaking them suitable for use as the basis of sources and\ndetectors for midinfrared optoelectronics. Recently, we ob-\ntained room temperature electroluminescence near 4 \u0002m\nfrom p-i-n LEDs fabricated from these pentanary alloys.14\nIn summary, we have demonstrated the LPE growth of\npentanary alloys lattice matched onto GaSb substrates. The\nepitaxial layers exhibit bright photoluminescence in the mid-\ninfrared region arising from transitions between localized\nstates within band tails. The temperature dependence of the\nband gap and thermal quenching behavior is consistent with\ncompositional modulation in these alloys, which are grown\nnear the miscibility gap.\nThe authors wish to thank EPSRC for financial support\n\u0002Grant No. GR\/S75826\/01\u0003 and for providing the award of a\nstudentship for one of the authors \u0002P.J.B.\u0003.\n1Mid-Infrared Semiconductor Optoelectronics, edited by A.
