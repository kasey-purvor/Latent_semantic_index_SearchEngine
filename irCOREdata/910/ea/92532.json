A study of six risk regulation regimes in the UK revealed that only half were exposed \nto substantial pressures of this type. Responses of organizations in the \u2018high-pressure\u2019 regimes were \nvaried, but the overall pattern was consistent with a mixture of an autopoietic and staged-response \nhypothesis stressing blame-prevention, and the paper accordingly presents a hybrid \u2018Catherine-\nwheel\u2019 model of the observed pattern. The paper concludes by discussing the implications for policy \noutcomes. \n \n3 \nRISK REGULATION UNDER PRESSURE: PROBLEM-SOLVING OR BLAME-SHIFTING?1\n \n1. BACKGROUND: OPENNESS IN RISK REGULATION REGIMES \n \nOpenness and transparency in regulation is conventionally regarded as a formula for \u2018good \ngovernance\u2019, because of its expected effects in reducing corruption and transaction costs, increasing \nlegitimacy and legality of regulation, and improving policy quality through enhanced intelligence \nand learning (see for instance Bentham, 1931, p. 410 and 1983, p. 410; New Zealand Treasury 1987, \np. 48; Brin, 1998). The aim of this paper is to assess how widespread demands for increased \nopenness are in risk regulation and how organizations engaged in risk regulation and management \nrespond to such pressures. To what extent or in what conditions do they seek to contain the pressure, \nalter what they do or simply roll with the punch? \n \nThere are plenty of bar-room anecdotes about the organizational politics of such responses. \nBut research of a more systematic kind is still in its infancy. In a partial attempt to fill the gap, this \npaper draws on a detailed study of risk regulation regimes (RRRs) in six different policy domains \n(see Hood et al, 1999). The aim is to explore how far conventional accounts of organizational \nresponses to environmental disturbance describe institutional behaviour in the face of pressures for \nincreased openness and transparency. The next (second) section defines openness and identifies \npressures for openness in the RRR six-pack referred to above. The third section lays out some \nhypotheses about expected institutional responses and outlines a standard disturbance-response \nmodel of institutional behaviour in the face of pressures for increased openness. The fourth section \ndescribes observed institutional behaviour in three regimes subject to strong pressures for increasing \nopenness, and the fifth section assesses the fit between observed behaviour and the hypotheses \ndescribed earlier. The sixth section develops a hybrid form of two of the hypotheses, and the final \nsection discusses what has been learned and its implications for policy. \n \n4 \n2. DEFINING AND TRACKING RRR OPENNESS \n \n \u2018Increasing openness\u2019 is defined for this purpose as involving some or all of the following \nthree elements: \n(i) greater transparency in organizational procedure; \n(ii) wider participation in some or all elements of an RRR; \n(iii) heightened accountability in the sense of increased obligations on the part of those responsible \nfor regulating and managing risks to explain and justify their behaviour to others. \nIndicators of a change in openness as defined above accordingly include changes in information rules \n(extending access to information) and participation rules (extending the range of players in the \ndecision process) and de facto accountability by decision-makers to public scrutiny. Openness in the \nsense defined above can be analytically distinguished from social pressures for increased openness, \nin the form of campaigns by media, law courts, business lobbies, politicians or other pressure groups. \nThe extent of media scrutiny overlaps the condition of openness and pressures for greater openness, \nbut pressures for greater openness are here taken to mean specific demands for change in that \ndirection coming from business interests, the media and other lobby groups. \n \nSome changes in openness in risk regulation and management may go across a whole society \nor legal jurisdiction (for instance, with freedom of information measures, human rights conventions \nor larger cultural shifts). And there is no doubt that some domains of risk regulation, like food safety, \nhealth care and nuclear power, have experienced considerable pressures for increased openness over \nthe last decade or two. Nevertheless, social and political pressures to increase openness in RRRs do \nnot seem to be of equal intensity for all types of risk, despite generalizations sometimes offered about \nrisk regulation as a whole being exposed to such pressures (Health and Safety Executive, 1998, p. 6; \nRoyal Commission on Environmental Pollution, 1998). Appendix 1 describes changes in the three \nelements of openness noted above for six selected domains of risk regulation in the UK. Those \ndomains are: (i) domestic radon- a natural radioactive gas radon that seeps into homes in some parts \n5 \nof the country; (ii) benzene - the car exhaust air pollutant and genotoxic carcinogen; (iii) the release \nof paedophile ex-offenders into the community; (iii) dangerous dogs; (iv) road risk regulation, \nparticularly concerning the changing balance of road risks between those in motor vehicles and other \nroad users; and (vi) pesticide residues in food and drinking water. \n \nAppendix 1 (a) summarizes the continuing \u2018openness\u2019 characteristics of three RRRs (radon, \ndangerous dogs and road risks) that do not seem to have been subjected to substantially increasing \npressures for openness over the past two decades. Appendix 1 (b) gives the same information for \nthree other RRRs (benzene, paedophile release and pesticide residues in food and drinking water) \nwhere pressures for openness appear to have grown. In each case, we present the salient features of \nthe information rules and conventions operating within the RRR (legal obligations or conventions on \nreporting, collecting and disclosing information); the participation and scrutiny rules, and the amount \nof de facto accountability to public or media scrutiny by those regulating or managing the risk. \nPutting those three elements together enables us to assess the overall level of openness of the RRR, \nthough that assessment is necessarily qualitative. Scoring overall regime openness is certainly not an \nexact science. \n \nNevertheless, even from a broad-brush qualitative analysis of a limited set of cases, we can \ndraw at least three general conclusions. First, as noted earlier, RRRs vary considerably both in their \npoint of departure - the status quo level of openness - and also in the degree of change in openness \nover recent decades. Second, regimes starting from a low base in \u2018openness\u2019 are not necessarily \nexposed to strong \u2018catching up\u2019 pressures to converge with those starting from a high base. While \nAppendix 1 includes at least one case of an RRR (road risks) starting from a relatively high status \nquo level of openness that shows little change from the status quo level, the reverse does not always \napply. The domestic radon case in the UK shows that in the absence of outside pressure there can be \na low degree of movement from a low status quo level (Leiss et al, 1998).  \n \n6 \nThird, while all the three \u2018change cases\u2019 described in Appendix 1 (a) are regimes previously \ndominated by cohesive professional policy communities, Appendix 1 (b) shows RRRs can move to \ngreater openness in different ways and in response to different pressures. This finding shows the \nvalue of a comparative-regime approach for the analysis of regulatory dynamics and also suggests \nthat a plurality of styles and routes to openness may lead to different policy or institutional \nconsequences, given the conventional expectations about the effects of policy openness as \nsummarized at the outset.  \n \nTo better understand the consequences of openness pressures, the institutional responses in \nthose regimes experiencing high pressures for change from the status quo need to be examined (given \nthat neither the condition of openness nor pressures for greater openness appear universal or uniform \nin RRRs). Accordingly we give a detailed account of institutional changes in the three cases in \nAppendix 1 (b) after considering hypotheses about institutional responses in the next section. \n \n7 \n3. HYPOTHESES ABOUT RESPONSES TO PRESSURES FOR OPENNESS IN RRRS \n \nWhat institutional responses to pressures for openness might be expected within RRRs? \nMany scholars have commented on the diversity of institutional theory (e.g. Hall and Taylor, 1997) \nand some have even questioned whether there is any distinctive institutional approach at all (e.g. \nJohn 1998, p. 65). But a theme which runs through much institutional analysis is a vision of human \norganizations and conventions as relatively closed systems which adapt selectively to environmental \ndisturbance (the \u2018disturbance\u2019 in this case being pressures for increased openness). Selective \nadaptation means that institutions adopt strategies for survival that seek to reconcile their own \npurposes and imperatives with environmental conditions or external demands. Institutions are thus \nseen as filters or distorting lenses in their dealings with the outside world (for example in Clay and \nSchaffer\u2019s (1984, p. 10) \u2018bureaucratic paradox\u2019, in which organizations focus on what is readily \ndoable whether or not it contributes to some larger purpose). Although such ideas are often linked \nwith biological evolutionary-strategy metaphors, they can be derived from independent propositions \nabout individual and social behaviour. \n \nResponses to demands for increased openness in risk regulation offer a particularly good test \nsite for this institutionalist perspective. There are good reasons to expect the filtering or distorting \nprocesses that institutionalists emphasize, because more transparency, participation and \naccountability can increase the threat of blame and liability for failures or make regulators\u2019 work \nmore stressful and conflict-laden. Indeed, one of the reasons why institutions limit openness in risk \nregulation in the first place is to limit or deflect blame and liability (in line with standard advice from \nlawyers and insurers to \u2018never admit fault\u2019). So in spite of the policy consequences conventionally \nexpected to flow from increased openness, as discussed at the outset, there are especially strong \nreasons to expect a filtering response to demands for increased openness in risk regulation, whether \nin the form of privacy protection (Brin, 1998), official secrecy or commercial confidentiality. \n8 \n \nThree hypotheses about institutional responses to demands for more RRR openness were \ninitially examined. None of them imply anything about the desirability or otherwise of organizational \nadaptation to pressures for change, and all of them were initially examined at the level of individual \norganizations rather than regimes (we shall return to the regime perspective later). The three \nhypotheses are as follows: \n \n(a) a null hypothesis of neutral compliance by organizations to external demands without perceptible \nfiltering or distortion. Full compliance behaviour can be considered a \u2018null hypothesis\u2019 because, \nby positing that organizational responses to demands for increased openness will be \nstraightforward and unproblematic, it runs against the central tenet of institutionalist analysis. \n \n(b) at the opposite extreme, a hypothesis drawn from the idea of autopoiesis (the tendency towards \nself-closure in the conceptual programmes of bounded systems with rich patterns of \u2018discourse\u2019 \nthat makes it impossible to exert direct control over those systems from outside (Brans and \nRossbach, 1997, p. 432ff)). From an autopoietic perspective, institutions would tend to respond to \npressures for greater openness in ways that reproduced their own purposes (particularly over \nissues of blame shifting and blame avoidance) or modi operandi with minimal disturbance.  \n \n(c) A hypothesis somewhere between the first and the second that posits a staged-response pattern. \nThe idea is that institutions respond to pressures for increased openness in a series of phases or \nsteps that amount to a staged retreat or rearguard action away from some initially-preferred \nposition in the face of pressure for abandonment of that position. Style-phase models of such \n\u2018staged-retreat\u2019 responses are common in institutional theory (see for example Beck J\u00f8rgensen, \n1985 and 1987; Joo, 1999). And it is common to distinguish, following Levy (1986), between \n\u2018first-order\u2019 and \u2018second-order\u2019 responses by organizations to environmental disturbance. First-\norder responses involve shifts in managerial arrangements and other organizational systems that \n9 \nleave core value systems or deeper structures unchanged. \u2018Second-order\u2019 responses involve \nchanges in those value systems. \n \nIn a well-known development of this general approach, Laughlin (1991) (see also Laughlin \nand Broadbent, 1995) and his colleagues have further differentiated first-order and second-order \ninstitutional responses to environmental disturbance. Laughlin divides first-order responses into \n\u2018rebuttal\u2019 (responses designed to resist the disturbance) and \u2018reorientation\u2019 (responses designed to \nchange an organization without affecting its core values). Similarly, second-order responses, \ninvolving changes in core values, are divided into 'colonization' (where new core values have \ncolonized part of the organization) and 'evolution' (where all stakeholders have absorbed the new \ncore values). \u2018Evolution\u2019 would have a different meaning at the level of regimes rather than single \norganizations, as we discuss later, but for the moment the focus is mainly on adaptation at the level \nof individual organizations.  \n \nLaughlin does not present the four responses in style-phase terms, though he argues that the \nfirst three are \u2018progressive\u2019 in some sense (Laughlin 1991: 200). He suggests that \u2018evolution\u2019 will \nnormally be produced by forces different from the other three responses and argues that attempts to \nproduce \u2018colonization\u2019 change in organizations by increasing financial pressure will not always \nsucceed. Nevertheless, for our third hypothesis we modify Laughlin\u2019s approach by representing the \nfour responses as progressive forms of \u2018staged retreat\u2019, going from the least to the most radical kind \nof adaptation as outside pressure for change continues. The hypothesis is that in such circumstances \norganizations move from first-order to second-order responses following the pathway depicted in \nFigure 1. This hypothesis is a mixture of the null hypothesis and the autopoetic hypothesis in that it \nleads us to expect first-order responses to new environmental demands that involve some element of \nautopoiesis, to be followed later by responses that are closer to the null hypothesis. \n FIGURE 1: Institutional Responses to Environmental Disturbance: Laughlin\u2019s Four Types of Change \nConceived as a Progressive Set of Responses \n \n \n \nFirst Order: \nValues Unchanged \nSecond Order:\nValues Changed\nPressures for \nOpenness \nEvolution \nColonization \nReorientation \nRebuttal \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n10 \n11 \n \n4. A TALE OF THREE RRRs FACING PRESSURES FOR INCREASED OPENNESS \n \nWe now examine the relative plausibility of the three hypotheses set out above by analyzing the \ninstitutional dynamics of the three RRRs that were exposed to continuing pressure for increased \nopenness as outlined in Appendix 1. This section gives a brief narrative account of developments in \neach of those three RRRs, and we assess the hypotheses in the light of these cases in the following \nsection. The focus is on the collection of organizations involved in risk regulation in each regime, \ncomprising both public-sector organizations and third-sector or corporate organizations with a role as \nintermediaries in regulation (notably in the form of obligations on corporations to operate first-line \ncontrols subject to general oversight from regulators). \n \n(a) Regulating the Risk of Paedophiles Released from Custody \n \nIncreased awareness and public discussion of the sexual abuse of children by adults has been \nobservable in the UK and many other developed countries over the last decade. While statistically the \ngreatest risk to children of murder or sexual abuse comes overwhelmingly from family members, \npublic debate focuses largely on risks from strangers, particularly those with a criminal record for \nsuch offences. Several interviewees from the police, probation and social services told us that as \nrecently as fifteen years ago, neither these services nor the public saw the risk of child sexual abuse \nas widespread. The state was not obliged to collect systematic information on the whereabouts and \nrisks of ex-offenders in the community. Such information as existed was limited and ad hoc, rarely \nshared amongst the relevant state organizations (police, probation officers, housing and social-\nservices professionals) and never relayed to the general public. \n \nProfessional and public concern about the risks from paedophiles in the community grew in \nthe 1990s, in the context of controversial child sexual abuse investigations, releases from prison of \n12 \nhigh-profile ex-offenders, and cases of infiltration of state education and social welfare organizations \nby paedophiles. What-to-do debates focused on the information held by the state on offenders, the \nsharing of that information among police and other public agencies, and its public disclosure. Central \nto the debate was a risk\/risk tradeoff issue. Reducing the risk of child sexual abuse by publicly \nidentifying released paedophiles may increase the risk of vigilante activity. The prospect of increased \nvigilante activity in turn increases incentives for ex-offenders to go underground, out of the reach of \nsupport and surveillance services, thus potentially mitigating or confounding the intended goal of risk \nreduction. Such downside risks of transparency have been much stressed by civil libertarians both in \nthe USA and UK. \n \nThe UK government response to increased public concern was the 1997 Sex Offenders Act. \nParalleling similar developments in the USA, the Act required the police to record the names and \naddresses of child sex offenders2. The UK regime was heavily biased against public disclosure of \ninformation on the Sex Offenders Register, however, in contrast to the transparent arrangements \nadopted by some US states under the 1994 \u2018Megan\u2019s Law\u2019 (Brin, 1998, p. 19). Although the 1997 \nAct allowed for disclosure in some conditions, the state authorities committed substantial resources \nto preventing leaks and defending a no-disclosure policy. They avoided the use of court imposed \nrestrictions on offenders that would reveal identity and fought off pressures for disclosure through \nthe courts.3  \n \nEven so, the legal requirement that police systematically collect information on ex-offenders \npotentially increased the \u2018blamability\u2019 of police, probation and other welfare bureaucracies for inept \nrisk-management if released paedophiles reoffended. In consequence, there were at least three \nchanges in the institutional management of released offenders. \n \nOne strategy was the adoption of more collegial behaviour among the various bureaucracies \ninvolved in the management of released offenders. This strategy aided the risk management process \n13 \nby increasing information flow between public agencies and, increasingly, \u2018trusted\u2019 \u2018third sector\u2019 \nvoluntary organizations. The adoption of collegial risk-management processes, however, also limited \nthe blame-potential for any single agency in the event of a tragedy by distributing responsibility \namongst all parties. \n \nLinked to the collegial strategy was the adoption of more formal written procedures or \nchecklists for risk assessment and management of ex-offenders. The ostensible purpose of such \nprotocols was to improve risk decision-making, particularly in allocating scarce resources. But they \nalso served the important purpose (as noted by many of our interviewees) of limiting blame by \nforming the basis of a procedural defence for officials if registered offenders committed further \noffences. \n \nA third change, albeit limited, was the classic \u2018NIMBY\u2019 response, in the form of a few local \nauthorities refusing to provide public housing for ex-offenders in their communities. In other cases, \nsome local authorities and housing organizations had to shoulder increased burdens because a bias \ntowards conservative risk assessment by local police and probation officials (seeking to protect \nthemselves from blame in the event of reoffence) led to a large number of released offenders being \nclassed as \u2018high risk\u2019. Local authority reluctance to provide public housing for high-profile offenders \nled central government to create secure accommodation for a small number of hard-to-place \noffenders was created in one of the English prisons, but that move itself encountered substantial local \nresistance. \n \n14 \n(b) Arrangements for Control of Pesticide Residues in Food and Drinking Water \n \nRisks to human health from pesticide residues in food and drinking water have attracted public \nand lobby-group attention since the early days of the environmental movement in the 1960s and have \nbeen identified as a \u2018dread risk\u2019 in the well-known Oregon risk-perception studies (Slovic et al, 1980, \np. 191). But until the 1980s regulation focused on official approval of pesticides rather than on \nmonitoring or controlling residue levels in food and drinking water. In an era of public-enterprise \ndrinking water supply there was little or no external regulation other than a statutory duty to supply \n\u2018wholesome\u2019 water. But this concept was not legally defined and it seems to have been assumed that \nprofessionalism and public service ethos on the part of water suppliers could be relied upon to ensure \ndrinking water was clean and safe (Healey, 1992). Food retailers and suppliers were similarly subject \nto general safety regulations which implied avoidance of excessive pesticide residue levels, but no \nspecific limits were laid down in law. \n \nThat fairly relaxed approach to regulation of pesticide residue levels changed both for food and \ndrinking water in the 1980s, though in different ways. In the case of food, the UK government started \nto introduce statutory maximum residue levels for some pesticides in 1988. \u2018Commercial \nconfidentiality\u2019 arguments largely prevailed, however, such that food retailers and suppliers were not \nobliged to disclose pesticide residue levels to consumers, and the same went for the local authorities \nresponsible for enforcement. At central government level, some ad hoc monitoring of pesticide \nresidues was undertaken by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food from 1957, and from \n1988 this monitoring developed into a systematic testing programme with aggregated results \npublished annually but sample sources anonymized. \n \nAs pressure continued for more openness and transparency, the Pesticides Safety Directorate -the \nUK Government agency responsible for pesticides- responded in two ways. First, it extended \nparticipation in debate over pesticide regulation by establishing a Pesticides Forum in 1996 which \n15 \nincluded a broader group of stakeholders such as established and trusted consumer and green groups, \nthan the formerly narrow group of insider expert and agribusiness consultees. Second, in 1999 central \ngovernment decided to move away from the previous aggregated and anonymized residue reporting \nto a new \u2018name and shame\u2019 approach which identified the retailers and suppliers of food tested \n(MAFF et al, 1999). This apparently radical shift towards greater transparency was limited, however, \nin that annual reporting allowed errant food suppliers to claim that the problems identified had long \nbeen remedied, with suppliers notified at least eight weeks in advance of publication. It also led, \nperhaps predictably, to greater scrutiny of the adequacy of the government\u2019s sampling and testing \nmethodologies by supermarkets, putting more pressure on the transparency of those arrangements. \n \nA more substantial shift towards transparency took place in the case of drinking water, which \nperhaps offers the clearest case of a move from a \u2018first-order\u2019 to a \u2018second-order\u2019 response in the face \nof demands for more openness. In 1980 levels of pesticide residues in drinking water were limited to \na \u2018surrogate-zero\u2019 level of 0.1ppb by a much-discussed EC Drinking Water Directive (80\/778\/EEC) \nthat epitomized the precautionary doctrine in risk management. The initial response to this Directive \nwas far from transparent. At first (according to industry and regulatory officials we interviewed), it \nwas simply assumed that the EC\u2019s surrogate-zero threshold was by and large being met, conveniently \nrendering any extensive monitoring effort unnecessary. Research in the early 1980s, however, \nrevealed that pesticide levels in drinking water in the UK, and particularly England, exceeded the EC \nlimit in many cases. The UK government responded by invoking scientific advice that most of the \nbreaches did not represent any health hazard and campaigned (unsuccessfully) on several occasions \nfor the replacement of the EC\u2019s blanket precautionary limit by generally higher4 health-based limits \nfor individual pesticides. In the meantime UK Ministers formally advised water companies that they \ndid not have to observe the precautionary limit as long as health-based limits specified by \ngovernment were met (see Healey and Jones, 1989).  \n \n16 \nOnly a few other EU member states undertook any monitoring for pesticide residues in drinking \nwater. Member-states response to EU requests for information tended to be one of delay, meaning \nthat the European Commission had little information on this subject. Even though monitoring became \nmandatory across the EU after the renegotiation of the Directive in 1998, delay in reporting is likely \nto be a continuing feature of many member state responses. \n \nA major step towards transparency in the UK regime came with the privatization of drinking \nwater supply in England and Wales in 1989 (Ward et al, 1995). This privatization conveniently \nremoved direct public responsibility for water supply in those parts of the country (specifically \nEngland) where pesticide contamination of drinking water was a real issue. Part of the privatization \nsettlement was an enhanced regulatory regime that embodied freedom of information requirements \nover pesticide residue levels along with mandatory monitoring, such that breaches of the limit were \nopenly established. Water companies had to put forward plans to deal with pesticide residues and \nsince privatization around \u00a32bn has been spent on compliance, with the costs fully borne by captive \nconsumers because the price control regulatory regime for drinking water allowed full cost pass-\nthrough. \n \n(c) Arrangements for Control of Ambient Benzene \n \nBenzene, an air pollutant associated mainly with vehicle exhausts, has been known as a \ngenotoxic carcinogen for almost thirty years. But until the 1990s little or no information was \ncollected on levels of ambient benzene and there were no legal maximum limits. A similar \n\u2018unpolitics\u2019 (Crenson, 1971) applied to benzene in other European countries. Indeed, one interviewee \nclaimed that ambient benzene only came onto the risk regulation agenda in the late 1980s when a \npetrochemical company objected to proposals to reduce levels of lead in petrol on the grounds that \nbenzene emissions would be increased. \n \n17 \nThe long delay in introducing monitoring or targets for benzene began to change in the 1990s. \nSystematic monitoring of urban air quality began to develop in the early 1990s, replacing an earlier \nuneven and ad hoc approach. And, following the line of least resistance, government began \npublishing the results (on CEEFAX and the internet) to avoid the need for bespoke responses to \ngreen groups and others demanding data under European rules on freedom of access to \nenvironmental information (SI 1992 No. 3240). Specific targets for benzene, with a long lead-time, \nbegan to be introduced from the mid-1990s. In 1997 the UK government set an \u2018objective\u2019 (whether \nit is a justiciable limit is ambiguous, according to the government\u2019s own lawyers) of not more than 5 \nparts per billion as an air quality standard, to take effect only in 2004 (SI 2000 No 928) In a parallel \nprocess, the EU set a more stringent European objective of just over 1.5 ppb to be achieved by 2010, \naccompanied by mandatory monitoring by member states (see DETR 2000). The delay built into both \nof these targets reflected a calculation that changes in vehicle engine and fuel technology would \neventually make the targets achievable without excessive pain to bureaucrats or voter-drivers (see \nDETR 1998a, p.7). But even then the long lead-time creates the possibility that targets could be \naltered later if non-achievement seems likely closer to the operative dates. \n \nIn setting the benzene \u2018objective\u2019 the UK government drew on the recommendations of an \nexpert panel (EPAQS\/DoE, 1994) that used a new methodology for assessing risk from genotoxic \ncarcinogens. The objective provoked pressure for more transparency from the petrochemical \nindustry, fearful that its interests might be threatened by the new standards. The department \nresponsible (Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions) responded to such criticism in \na review of advisory processes, concluding that full openness might inhibit candid discussion among \nexpert advisors. The proposal was therefore to publish non-verbatim minutes or not attribute remarks \nto named individuals (DETR 1998b, p. 11). \n \nThe advent of transparent monitoring and quantified standards for air quality was \naccompanied by at least two notable institutional changes. One was legislation in 1995 (The \n18 \nEnvironment Act 1995) that laid on local authorities the responsibility for assessing and reviewing \nair quality in their areas in order to meet centrally-imposed standards. This legislation could be \ninterpreted as an effort by central government to share or shift blame in the UK context, even though \nthe division of responsibilities between central and local government (for instance over trunk roads \nand local roads) create fertile opportunities for mutual blame avoidance.5 A second development was \nthat if local authorities failed to achieve the UK targets set to take effect in 2004, the preparation of \nan action plan to reduce benzene levels as part of an Air Quality Management Zone would serve as a \nprocedural defence against legal or regulatory sanctions.6\n \n \n19 \n5. EVALUATING THE INITIAL HYPOTHESES  \n \nTable 1 summarizes the institutional responses to openness pressures within each of the three \n\u2018high-pressure\u2019 RRRs described above, identifying responses that are consistent with the three \nhypotheses set out earlier. It may surprise those who see the first two hypotheses as \u2018straw men\u2019 to \nfind that both of those hypotheses were consistent with several elements of observed organizational \nbehaviour within each of the three high-pressure RRRs. However, neither the null hypothesis (of \nstraightforward responses to demands to openness pressures) nor the autopoietic hypothesis (of \nclosed discourse communities transforming every external demand into \u2018self-reproduction\u2019) can \naccount for all the observed responses on its own. There was a substantial amount of organizational \nbehaviour that fits institutionalist expectations of distortion or filtration, but there were also \nsubstantial changes in behaviour or the distribution of power. For instance, water companies and \nregulators had to get used to a transparency regime that would have been unthinkable twenty years \nbefore and new benzene standards set the stage for an attempt by central government to shift at least \npart of the blame (or glory) over compliance to local authorities. \n.  \n \n \n \n20 \nTABLE 1: Institutional Responses to Pressures for Increased Openness Within Three Risk \nRegulation Regimes \n RRR Domain \n Arrangements for release \nof paedophiles \nControl of pesticide \nresidues \nControl of ambient \nbenzene \n \nDegree and Type of \nPressure for Openness \nStrong public and media \npressure for public \ndisclosure over released \npaedophiles but counter-\npressures on privacy from \nhuman rights lobbies and \ninstitutions \n \nGeneral public and media \nconcern for more \ninformation over \npesticide residues; \nbusiness concern with \ncommercial \nconfidentiality and \nregulatory requirements \nGeneral public and green \nlobby pressure for more \ninformation on general air \npollution, rather than \nbenzene in particular; \nstrong business pressure \nfor transparency over \nstandards \nFeatures of Regulator \nResponse \n \n   \nFitting Null Hypothesis Substantial resources \ncommitted by police to \ncollection of information \non released ex-offenders \nPost 1989 privatized \nwater companies now \ngenerally meet EC limits \nafter public disclosure at \nfirst revealed breaches of \nthose limits  \nMany local authorities \nadopted a \u2018get on with it\u2019 \napproach and central \ngovernment took line of \nleast resistance in \npublishing monitoring \ndata under EU monitoring \nrules \n \nFitting Autopoietic \nHypothesis \nAlteration of procedures \nto keep public disclosure \nto the minimum \nPre-1989 state-owned \nwater suppliers simply \nignored EC limits (but on \nMinisterial advice) \nFlexible approach to \nnational targets and \nobjectives\u2013 goalposts \nmovable in the event of \nnon-compliance  \n \nFitting Staged Response \nHypothesis \nNot much more than \n\u2018first-order\u2019 responses \ndiscernible: e.g. more \nresources committed to \nexplaining policy of non-\ndisclosure; alteration of \nprocedures to limit \npossibility of blame \nshifting by \u2018hang-\ntogether\u2019 approaches; \nextension of checklist \napproach and written \nprocedures to provide \nprocedural defence \nagainst blame; NIMBY \napproach of refusal to \nhouse by a few local \nauthorities  \n \nNot much more than \n\u2018first-order\u2019 responses \ndiscernible in food (with \nreorientation of regulators \nto \u2018control of control\u2019 but \nlimited and delayed \ndisclosure policy over \nnon-compliance). \n \nApparently clearer case \nof progression to \n\u2018second-order\u2019 in \ndrinking water, with \neventual move to \n\u2018transparent compliance\u2019 \napproach after earlier \ndelay and regulatory \ncollusion over evasion.  \nNot much more than \n\u2018first-order\u2019 responses \ndiscernible, with \ndeveloping \u2018inertia \ncompliance\u2019 approach of \ndelaying onset of targets \nuntil long-term \ntechnological changes \ncan be expected to deliver \ncompliance without \u2018hard \nchoices\u2019, linked with \nreorientation of formal \nresponsibility to make \nculpability ambiguous in \nthe event of non-\ncompliance. \n \n \n \n21 \nBy a process of elimination we might conclude that observed organizational behaviour in \nthese three cases fits the \u2018staged response\u2019 hypothesis more closely than the other two. It will be \nrecalled from Figure 1 that Laughlin and his colleagues divided \u2018first-order\u2019 institutional responses to \nenvironmental disturbance into \u2018rebuttal\u2019 and \u2018reorientation\u2019 strategies. Both strategies were readily \nobservable in the three high-pressure RRRs. \u2018Problem denial\u2019 and resistance to demands for \ntransparent operation occurred in some form in all of them, often (but not always) at an early stage of \npolicy development \u2013 such as the defensive information-sharing approach developed in the \npaedophiles regime. \u2018Reorientation\u2019 also figured prominently in institutional behaviour, notably in \nthe redistribution of responsibilities with the aim of reducing blame or liability or the introduction of \nadditional complexity into organizational structures. An example was central government\u2019s \ndesignation of local authorities as responsible for local air quality with the advent of standards and \nmonitoring, creating a structure in which blame for failure to meet targets is ambiguous. \n \nBut little evidence could be found of a clear progression from a \u2018first-order\u2019 of unchanged \ninstitutional values to a \u2018second-order\u2019 when those values had changed. Drinking water seemed to be \nthe only fairly clear-cut case of such a progression, since it moved from an initial pattern of see-no-\nevil denial and regulatory collusion over evasion in the public-enterprise era to a substantially \ntransparent regime after privatization. Across much of what was observed in institutional responses, \nit seems hard to argue that there was a clear shift between what Laughlin and similar analysts see as \n\u2018first-order\u2019 institutional responses to disturbances to \u2018second-order\u2019 responses at a later stage. \n \nIndeed, the organizational value that seems most consistent with the pattern of responses \ndescribed in the last section is that of limiting blame and liability. But blame-and-liability limiting \nconsiderations had different implications for organizations dependent on their institutional position. \nIn the high-pressure regimes, public sector regulators adopted reorientation or rebuttal strategies \nwhere new standards threatened to increase their exposure to blame or make their jobs more stressful, \nas in the case of paedophiles. But those public regulators took up different stances where openness \n22 \ncould not be expected to have such consequences (as in the case of ambient benzene, where the long \ndelay over implementation against a changing pattern of vehicle and fuel technology meant standards \nwould be likely to be reached by a process of \u2018inertia compliance\u2019). \n \nSimilar variation applied to private-sector organizations where they formed part of the \nregulatory regimes, notably as intermediaries applying \u2018enforced self-regulation\u2019 (Ayres and \nBraithwaite, 1992), as in the cases of pesticide residues in food and water. Where such organizations \nwere in competitive markets, as in the case of food and agribusiness companies, blame-and-liability \nlimitation led them to press for greater transparency over regulatory standard-setting, but to oppose it \nover enforcement on grounds of \u2018commercial confidentiality\u2019. However, private sector organizations \nin monopoly positions with pass-through price control regimes, as in the case of the privatized water \nutilities, had much less reason to adopt such a position. If blame-and-liability limitation was a key \nconsideration in organizational responses to demands for greater openness, it played out differently \naccording to institutional position and type, and it could play out differently at regime and \norganizational level.  \n  \n23 \n6. MODIFYING THE INITIAL HYPOTHESES \n \nA hypothesis that would fit best with these, admittedly limited, observations seems to be a \nmixture of the second and third hypotheses, i.e. a weak form of autopoiesis and a staged-response \napproach dominated by \u2018first-order\u2019 responses at an organizational level. A modified hypothesis of \nthat type, compatible with the behaviour observed, would have the following seven components. \n \n(a) The response of individual regulator organizations to demands for increased openness in RRRs is \nheavily conditioned by the expected implications for blame and liability, but those implications are \nnot the same for all organizations. \n \n(b) Where a shift to increased openness and transparency has major expected implications for blame \nand liability, organizations facing demands for greater openness will tend to engage in \u2018blame \nprevention reengineering\u2019 (BPR),7 seeking to transfer or dissipate the increased blame or liability that \nincreased transparency or new information requirements might bring.  \n \n(c) The repertoire of \u2018blame prevention reengineering\u2019 responses at organizational level can be \nbroadly characterized in Laughlin\u2019s terms as variants of \u2018rebuttal\u2019 and \u2018reorientation\u2019 behaviour, but \ncomprised at least six different specific responses, as shown in Table 2. Apart from simple rebuttal \nand reorientation in the ordinary-language sense of these terms, the four other observed responses \nwere as follows:  \n \nDelay in responding to demands for greater openness was a feature of observed organizational \nbehaviour in all the high-pressure regimes. Delay is a common bureaucratic response to freedom of \ninformation regimes (see, for example, Roberts\u2019 (1998, pp. 3-6) analysis of responses to Canadian \nFOI legislation). The clearest example from the three regimes was the delay by EU member states (in \nsome cases by up to several years) in supplying information to the European Commission on \n24 \npesticide residue levels in drinking water in the mid-1990s. Variants on the \u2018delay\u2019 theme also \nincluded \u2018planned obsolescence\u2019 in reporting violations of standards (pesticide residues in food) and \ndelaying the onset of targets when monitoring information becomes available (ambient benzene). \nAnd finally, in the paedophiles regime, the police only disclosed the identity of known offenders to \nthe public as a last resort if nothing else could ensure public safety. \n \n\u2018Pre-buttal\u2019 was also an observed BPR response by organizations facing demands for increased \nopenness \u2013 attempts by organizations to respond to anticipated criticisms or demands for information \nbefore they materialize. At one level this response involves an increase in organizational \nsophistication or capacity to cope with a \u2018goldfish-bowl\u2019 existence (more flak-catchers and \nenvironmental scanners to get the organization\u2019s retaliation in first, which was a notable feature of \npolice responses to the 1997 Sex Offenders Act). The key feature of prebuttal is the manufacture of \nexcuses or alibis in advance, such that attempts to blame an organization in the light of increased \ntransparency will fail to hit their target. \n \n\u2018Protocolization\u2019 or formalization of organizational operations, was a third observed BPR response, \nand indeed such behaviour is a standard bureaucratic approach to minimizing blame and liability \nproblems (see Lawton and Parker, 1998). Following transparent rules potentially provides \u2018due \ndiligence\u2019 defences when an organization\u2019s risk management comes to be questioned and produces a \nverifiable 'audit trail' for regulators (see Power, 1997). As the account of the three RRRs in section 4 \nindicated, protocolization in some form appeared in all cases and particularly in the paedophile \nregime, where it was central to the defensive blame prevention reengineering strategy of the public \norganizations concerned. \n \nService abandonment \u2013 the abandonment of some types of service altogether \u2013 was observable as a \ndrastic BPR response to openness pressures in some cases. Such a response is more commonly \nobservable among regulatees (particularly small or marginal operators faced with increasing \n25 \nregulatory burdens) than among regulators or public authorities. But it can occur in the latter case, for \ninstance when public authorities stop issuing advice or information for fear of blame, legal liability \nor other adverse reactions. In the three high-pressure regimes, the clearest case of service \nabandonment was observed in the paedophiles regime. That was the refusal by some local authorities \nto resettle paedophile ex-offenders classed as \u2018high risk\u2019 by the joint deliberation process described \nabove. That service-abandonment response partly created the need for a national back-stop facility as \ndescribed earlier. \n \n26 \nTABLE 2: Six Varieties of Institutional Response \nRRR Domain  \n \nInstitutional Response \nManagement of \nPaedophile Release \nPesticide Residues in \nFood & Drinking Water \nAmbient Benzene \n \nDelay \n \nPublic disclosure of \ninformation about \npaedophiles only as final \nresort \n \nHeavy emphasis in \ndrinking water \u2013 e.g. delay \nby some EU member \nstates in reporting levels \nof pesticide residues in \ndrinking water, and built-\nin delay in \u2018naming and \nshaming\u2019 policy over food \n \nHeavy emphasis \u2013 20-year \ndelay in developing \nmonitoring after discovery \nof benzene as a genotoxic \npollutant; delay in EU \nmember states\u2019 response \nto Commission demands \nfor information; delay of \nonset of targets until \ntechnological change \nmakes them likely to be \nachievable without pain \n \nSimple Rebuttal Rejection and legal \ncontestation of demands \nfor greater public \ndisclosure \nOriginal denial of \ncompliance problem over \ndrinking water, followed \nby assertion that no health \nhazard involved in breach \nof EC precautionary \nlimits; use of commercial \nconfidentiality to limit \npublic disclosure over \nfood \n \n \nOrganizational \nReorientation \nPooling information to \nshare blame for \nmanagement of risks of \nregistered paedophiles \nPrivatization of water in \nEngland and Wales \ncreating greater ambiguity \nover blame in failure to \nmeet standards \nAssignment of \nmanagement \nresponsibilities to local \nauthorities, creating a \nstructure of studied \nambiguity through \norganizational \ncomplexification over \nblame for non-\nachievement of targets \n \nService Abandonment Some local authorities \nrefusing to house \nregistered paedophiles \n \n  \nProtocolization Checklist approach as a \nprocedural defence against \nblame \n\u2018Due diligence\u2019 checklist \ndefence developed in food \nafter 1990 Food Safety \nAct, and in water \n\u2018Management plan\u2019 as \npotential defence against \nblame by local authorities \nnot in compliance with \ntargets \n \nPrebuttal Increasing effort of \nagencies to explain \nmanagement of offenders \nin the community to local \nresidents without \ndisclosing specific \ninformation \n\u2018Control of control\u2019 \napproach in food to limit \nregulator exposure to \nblame \n \n \n \n27 \n(d) The six types of blame prevention reengineering responses discussed above and summarized in \nTable 2 will not necessarily succeed in deflecting blame in practice, and need not necessarily follow \nany fixed or uniform sequence. While simple rebuttal can often be expected to come at an early stage \nin the sequence of responses, these cases suggest that rebuttal may precede, follow or accompany a \ndelay response, and rebuttal\u2019s \u2018cousin\u2019 pre-buttal may come later in the sequence of responses. \nService abandonment, protocolization and reorganization of organizational boundaries, procedures or \nresponsibilities likewise need not take place in any particular order. \n \n(e) Many of the six organizational BPR responses observed here are hard to categorize according to \nthe distinction between first- and second-order responses discussed earlier. Many if not all of them \ncould be responses of both types. For example, \u2018prebuttal\u2019 might be a sophisticated first-order \nresponse, representing a high point of anticipation and manipulative capacity. But it could also be a \nsecond-order response by an organization that has so thoroughly absorbed openness values that its \npublic information-base constitutes a way of nipping in the bud demands for more transparency. \nProtocolization also seems ambiguous in terms of any distinction between first-order and second-\norder responses, since it could either be a symptom of an organization that has adopted new values or \nsimply function as an official shield against prying outsiders, offering a procedural defence that \nestablished routines have been followed. Service abandonment too might be an extreme form of first-\norder response \u2013 perhaps the only way to keep underlying values unchanged - or it could be the \nultimate expression of change in values. \n \n(f) This account of organizational responses to pressures for increased openness in RRRs, \nrepresented in Figure 2, is a mixture of weak autopoiesis and a less linear form of our initial third \n(staged-response) hypothesis. It looks less like an evolutionary ladder or stairway than a \u2018Catherine \nWheel\u2019 (a type of rotating firework). It conceives of a \u2018problem space\u2019 (constituted by demands for \nincreased openness and accountability over risk management) to which organizations within a regime \ncan respond in any of the ways discussed above. If those responses relieve the \u2018openness pressure\u2019, \n28 \nthe system moves out of the \u2018problem space\u2019. But if the response fails to relieve the pressure, the \nsystem returns to the \u2018problem space\u2019 for another iteration. There is no automatic sequence of \nresponse and no necessary \u2018ladder\u2019 process. And apart from simple rebuttal (but not \u2018prebuttal\u2019) each \nof the organizational responses depicted on Figure 2 could be linked with both value change and \nvalue stasis. \n \n(g) Outcomes for openness at regime level will depend on the combination of individual \norganizational responses, and on the distribution of power among the various organizations in the \nregime. Even if some organizations within a RRR adopt a \u2018null hypothesis\u2019 response to pressures for \ngreater openness, the regime as a whole will not necessarily exhibit greater openness if other \norganizations adopt autopoietic or \u2018first-order\u2019 responses. \nFIGURE 2.

CONCLUSION \n \n The analysis here is based on a limited number of cases, so conclusions are tentative and the \nrepertoire of observed responses by organizations to pressures for increased openness is not likely to \nbe exhaustive. For instance, the response of data falsification which has been observed in other risk \nand safety regimes (for example in nuclear safety and chemical safety [see The Independent, 14.9.99; \nMillstone, 1986, p. 99]) was not observed in the three high-pressure regimes examined here, though \nit is included among the repertoire of possible responses in Figure 2. Detailed investigation of more \ncases and further differentiation of types of pressures for increased openness (distinguishing, for \ninstance, different sources and patterns of incidence over time) is needed for systematic identification \nof what types of pressures for openness produce what types of BPR responses in what types of \norganization. \n \nNevertheless, three fairly clear conclusions can be drawn from this study. First, not all \ndomains of risk regulation are exposed equally \u2013 or at all \u2013 to long-term pressures for greater \ntransparency and openness. Only half of the cases considered here fell into that category. Second, \nobservation of institutional responses in three RRRs exposed to openness pressures suggests \ninstitutional filtering or distortion processes can readily be detected. The null hypothesis was \ncompatible with only a minority of observations, and hence it seems dangerous to base design of \nregulatory arrangements on some version of the null hypothesis. Such an assumption may lead to \nunanticipated \u2018toothpaste tube\u2019 outcomes (in the language of Baldwin and Hawkins (1984, p. 582)) in \nwhich a squeeze at one point in a regime is accompanied by a bulge at another and the net change is \nproblematic. Something closer to an institutional-design equivalent of the well-known precautionary \nprinciple would seem a more robust basis for policy.  \n \nThird, much of what was observed in the three high-pressure RRRs is compatible with a \nmodel of dynamic interaction between organizations and their environment in which inertia is the \n31 \ndefault response and BPR considerations heavily influence a varied repertoire of further responses. \nThe \u2018Catherine wheel\u2019 schema portrayed by Figure 2 summarizes such a model. The implication is \nthat society-wide generalizations about risk regulation based on aggregated conceptions of \u2018risk \nsociety\u2019 (Beck, 1992) will have little power to predict or explain the variety (both static and \ndynamic) of risk regulation regimes. A less aggregated level of analysis, and more attention to \ninstitutional filtering, is needed for that purpose. \n \nThree other more tentative and closely related conclusions can also be drawn from this study. \nOne is that what happens over transparency and openness at the regime level of risk regulation can be \ndifferent from what happens at the level of individual organizations. For example, in some risk \ndomains numerous organizations may move to higher levels of openness, but the regime as a whole \nremains limitedly open, because a key group of players whose information is needed to complete the \nloop in some way, stay at the level of first-order responses. Something approximating to that pattern \nwas exhibited in the pesticide residues in food regime (where enforced self-regulation by food \nretailers remained largely within the realms of commercial confidentiality). A regime can involve \ncommercial confidentiality as the main bulwark against disclosure even if public institutions become \nprocedurally more open. Alternatively, even if the various regulator organizations within an RRR \nrespond to pressures for openness by increased organizational complexification (as in sub-\ncontracting or decoupling of RRRs), the upshot may be a regime that is even harder for ordinary \nconsumers, workers or citizens to understand, hence substantively more opaque even if each \ncomponent organization is procedurally more open. \n \nEqually, in some domains all that is needed for the regime as a whole to move to greater \ntransparency and openness is for one powerful organizational player to change its position. As we \nsaw, in the case of pesticide residues in water, the UK central government\u2019s move to privatize \ndrinking water supply in England and Wales meant that it no longer had an interest in opacity over \npesticide levels, and the result was a regime that was substantially open. To understand regulatory \n32 \ndynamics over openness, a distinction between regime and individual organizational responses and \noutcomes is crucial.  \n \nA further conclusion is that strategies intended to avoid blame will not necessary achieve that \neffect in practice (which is why Figure 2 incorporates iterative search) and may still produce effects \nincorporating some of the policy consequences conventionally associated with increased openness, as \nnoted at the outset. For example, even if the police response to statutory requirements for registration \nof paedophile ex-offenders is interpreted as dominated by BPR considerations of locking in all the \nother public-sector players into collective deliberation, the effect of that strategy was nevertheless to \nenhance intelligence and shared information across the regime. Similarly, even if blame-shifting was \na key factor in UK central government response assigning responsibility to local authorities for \nambient benzene in the face of openness pressures, those authorities nevertheless had to compile \nexplicit and locally-oriented responses against a background of published benzene monitoring data. \nWhile BPR-dominated responses to pressures for increased openness may in some conditions detract \nfrom policy effectiveness through the side-effects they produce (for instance in service abandonment \nor goal displacement through protocolization, one of the classic sources of bureaucratic dysfunction \nidentified by Merton (1960)), they can also in some conditions contribute to greater policy capacity \nand intelligence. \n \nFinally, this analysis shows regulatory regimes and organizations can respond to openness \npressures from different starting-points and in different ways. Not all of the responses included in the \nCatherine-wheel model in Figure 2 are necessarily available to all organizations in a regime. And if \nresponses and starting-points are diverse, so are the policy consequences of shifts in openness and \ntransparency. For example, in the paedophile regime, change began from a low level of transparency \nand took the form of increased internal openness among the professional-bureaucratic players in the \nfield rather than disclosure to the public at large. Given the risk\/risk tradeoffs involved in increased \nopenness to the public at large in that domain, it is far from indisputable that full public disclosure \n33 \nwould lead to an increase in overall policy effectiveness in limiting risk. The same does not apply to \nrisk domains like pesticide residues and ambient benzene. \n \nThe purpose of this paper is primarily descriptive and comparative. The study it describes \nsought to observe and analyze institutional responses to pressures for increased openness in RRRs, \nnot to follow the many authors who have discussed the inherent desirability or otherwise of \nincreasing openness in risk management (e.g. Shrader-Frechette, 1991) or the much-discussed policy \ndilemmas associated with such openness.8 Nevertheless, descriptive and analytic work of this kind \nhas implications for normative questions of policy and institutional design. \n \n \n \n34 \nAppendix 1: Changes in Openness and Six UK RRRs  \n(A) Three Cases With Little General Increase In Pressures For Openness Over 20 Years \n \n Enduring Features \n \n \n \nDomain \nInformation Rules \n(a) Reporting\/ collecting obligations \n(b) Publication\/ disclosure obligations \nParticipation and Scrutiny Rules \n(a) Consultation obligations \n(b) Formal Public Accountability \nRules \nDe Facto \nAccountability to \nPublic Scrutiny \nOverall Openness \n \nRadon in \nhomes \n \n(a) No obligation on property owners to \nundertake tests; no obligation on \ngovernment to assess radon levels (apart \nfrom a 1990 EC recommendation that \nmember states assess radon levels); UK \ngovernment by convention has \nconducted a UK-wide survey of radon \nlevels by area \n \n(b) Caveat emptor rule on disclosure for \nproperty vendors: Government by \nconvention publishes radon levels by \narea but not house by house \n \n \n(a) Consultation by convention \nonly with international policy \ncommunity of radon experts and \nUK radiation professionals \n \n(b) Limited formal \naccountability rules with \nresponsibility located in an \nexpert UK-wide quango \nrelatively detached from \ngovernment departments \n  \n \nLow \u2013 kept \nwithin \nprofessional \nsphere \n \nLOW \n \nLow salience and \n\u2018expertized\u2019 but \nwith official risk \ndata base providing \ngeneral \ninformation \nDangerous  \nDogs \n(a) No general obligation to register \ndogs (except for 4 types specified in \n1991and in N.

L211252043), and we thank ESRC and the LSE \nfor financial support. The project compared risk regulation regimes in a total of nine different policy domains, based on \ndocumentary analysis, media analysis and over 300 interviews with regulatory players. \n2 As well as some other types of sex offenders. \n3 In a 1997 test case, a court upheld the status quo, holding that disclosure should be only on a need-to-know basis, not a \nmatter of general entitlement (R v. Chief Constable for the North Wales Police Area Authority et al, 10 July 1997). \n4 A few pesticides present risks to health at residue levels below 0.1ppb.  \n5 In an EU context central rather than local government would be answerable to the European Court of Justice over \nfailure to meet standards. \n6 By contrast the EU regime required member states were obliged to meet specified targets by 2010, but the even longer \nimplementation lead-time creates scope for member states to apply for derogations from the Air Quality Directive \n(96\/62\/EC) and its associated Directives before the target takes effect. \n7 BPR in the language of management science conventionally denotes 'business process re-engineering'. But BPR as \nblame prevention engineering seems equally important in organizational behaviour. \n8 Such dilemmas include the danger of increasing public risks through exploitation of information by criminals or \nterrorists (Sieber, 1981), through panic responses to official information (Partridge, 1988, pp. 330-43) and through \ncomplacency or placation, with reduction in care and alertness. \n"}
