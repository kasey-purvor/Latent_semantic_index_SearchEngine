Within the framework of the AMMA project, three eddy covariance flux stations were installed to sample the three main surface types near Hombori (Mali) in the central Sahel at 15.3\u00b0N, and a fourth station was installed near Bamba in the northern Sahel at 17.1\u00b0N to sample semi-desert conditions.
