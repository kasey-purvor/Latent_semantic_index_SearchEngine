The\nsubmodels, consisting of grass production, livestock feeding, livestock thermal bal-\nance, the thermal balance of naturally ventilated buildings and a stochastic weather\ngenerator, are described.

Parry et al. (1998) identify\nthree orders of interactions: biophysical, enterprise and\nnational. At the smallest scale, the changes to the\nthermal, hydrological and nutrient regime on plant\nphysiology can be studied directly (Kimball 1983;\nMelillo et al. 1990). At the largest scale, the changes to\nthe global economy will impact on the need for food and\nthe location of food supplies. Practical agriculture lies\nbetween these two extremes. It grows plants, but is much\nmore than just the growing of plants: it is concerned with\nthe nurture, protection, and utilization of those plant\nproducts. It is affected by global economics, but to\nindividual farmers these are external constraints, applied\nin terms of costs and prices.\nThe group of studies included in this and the\ncompanion paper (Turnpenny et al. 2000c) focus on the\nfarm-level impacts of climate change, and so take both\nthe physiological scale changes and the macroeconomic\nsituation as the context within which the system\nfunctions. The aim is to examine the functioning of the\nmost basic agricultural unit, the farm. It differs from the\napproach taken by studies such as those, for example,\nHarrison (1996), UKCCIRG (1996) or Brignall et al. (1996),\nwhich have produced maps of crop possibilities for\nfuture climate scenarios, generated by assuming that the\nrelevant crops may be grown at all locations. By contrast,\nanalysis at the farm level examines the need to maintain\nthe whole farm enterprise, the level at which decisions\nare taken within the possibilities de\u00aened by the climate\nand constrained by the economic context.\nInterest is focused on livestock systems, which include\nboth the production of the basic foodstuff, its utilization\nby the grazing animal, and then (in the companion\npaper) the issue of the welfare and productivity of\nhoused animals. In all of these studies, the aim is to\nidentify the degree to which agricultural practices and\nopportunities will change as the climate changes.\nThis study could, in principle, be applied to any or all\nlocations in England and Wales. However, rather than\nattempt distributed implementations, it concentrates on\nthree locations which were chosen to be typical of wide\nareas, and for which support data were available. These\nthree sites were:Correspondence: D. J. Parsons, fax + 44\/1525 860156, e-mail\ndavid.parsons@bbsrc.ac.uk\nGlobal Change Biology (2001) 7, 93\u00b1112\n# 2001 Blackwell Science Ltd 93\nd Boxworth, Cambridgeshire. Typical of the lowland\nareas of Eastern England.\nd Cheshire plains. Typical of lowland milk producing\nareas.\nd Pwilpeiren, Wales. This is representative of the upland\nsituation.\nThe study could be implemented for any future\nscenario of climate change. It concentrated on the IPCC\n92 scenarios, using the IS92a (business as usual) scenario\nfor the year 2050. Tests showed that the predicted\ndifferences in impact between the IPCC 92 scenarios\nwere small at this date. Larger timescales, which would\ncause signi\u00aecant differences, were inappropriate for this\nstudy.\nLimitations (self-imposed)\nIt is clear that changes to the climate will affect the global\neconomy and the price structure for agriculture.\nHowever, converting the current range of economic\npredictions into a set of costs that could be input into a\nmodel is outside the scope of this project. For this reason,\nthe models adopted do not attempt to explore these\nchanges, but instead assume that the current price\nstructure for agricultural commodities will remain\nsimilar to prices today. (This is not to say that the prices\nwill be constant, but that they will remain in the same\nrelation one to another). The model developed, however,\nwould be capable of exploring the effects of differing\nprice structures, should a suitable set of inputs be\nde\u00aened. The virtue of changing only part of the model\ninputs (the climate) is that it allows the isolation of the\neffects of a single variable. This is the classical scienti\u00aec\nmethod, and the results of the study can thus be viewed\nas the outcome of a numerical experiment rather than as\nprediction of the future.\nBy the same token, the study does not attempt to\nidentify the effect of the changes of carbon dioxide\nconcentration on either the radiation or the water use\nef\u00aeciency of the grass plants. To do so would have\nrequired parameterization of processes that were still the\nsubject of basic research at the time the models were\nestablished. The magnitude of any effect would necessa-\nrily have been related to the anticipated carbon dioxide\nconcentration in the atmosphere, for the relevant time for\neach of the six IPCC92 scenarios. Although Stockle et al.\n(1992) provide an algorithm for including this effect, they\nhave not validated their approach for grass crops.\nComponent models\nA schematic diagram of the integrated models is shown\nin Fig. 1. There are four main submodels:\n1 Grass production, which predicts the growth of grass\nand the amount harvested for silage.\n2 Livestock feeding, which predicts the intake of grass\nand concentrates, and calculates the metabolic heat\nproduction.\n3 Animal heat balance, which predicts the thermal\nexchanges between the animals and their environment,\nand their physiological responses.\n4 Building, which predicts the internal temperature and\nhumidity of livestock buildings.\nThese models, together with the weather generator\nused to provide the data to drive them, are described\nbelow.\nGrass model\nThe state of the grass crop is simulated by the SWARD\n(Soil Water And Response to Drainage) model\n(Armstrong et al. 1995). This model was developed by\nDowle & Armstrong (1990) in the context of the North\nWyke drainage experiment (Armstrong & Garwood\n1991; Tyson et al. 1993), and has been subsequently used\nfor climate change impact studies (Armstrong & Castle\n1992, 1995; Armstrong 1996).\nThe SWARD model simulates, in parallel, the water\nbalance for the soil and the herbage weight in the grass\nsward. The model considers the soil as a single store to\nwhich water is added as rainfall and removed by\nevapotranspiration and (if relevant) by drainage. Two\nimportant soil parameters are thus the moisture content\nat which crop stress begins (wilting point, WP) and the\ncontent at which transpiration and growth cease (perma-\nnent wilting point, PWP). Between WP and PWP the\nactual rate of evapotranspiration is reduced in propor-\ntion to the stress. Water may be stored in excess of \u00aeeld\ncapacity, up to the total porosity of the soil. If the soil is\ndrained, this water drains from the pro\u00aele at a rate\ncalculated from the Hooghought drainage equation\n(Ritzema 1994). Water is removed from the pro\u00aele only\nby drainage or evapotranspiration, so the model is\napplicable to clay soils, rather than freely draining soils.\nThe state of the grass sward is modelled by a balance\nequation. Grass is added by growth, and removed by\nsenescence and harvesting (cutting or grazing). The rate\nof senescence is dependent on temperature and herbage\nweight (Dowle & Armstrong 1990), and the rate of grass\ngrowth (Gact) is de\u00aened by a maximum potential rate\n(Gmax) multiplied by a series limiting functions which\ntake values between 0 and 1\nGact \u0088 Gmaxf \u0085JW\u0086f \u0085N\u0086f \u0085T\u0086f \u0085B\u0086; \u00851\u0086\nwhere Gmax is a physiological constant, depending on the\nnature of the sward. For ryegrass swards in UK a value\nof 250 kg ha\u00b11 d\u00b11 has been reported (Parsons & Johnson\n1985).\n94 D . J . P A R S O N S et al.\n# 2001 Blackwell Science Ltd, Global Change Biology, 7, 93\u00b1112\nFor this study, the nitrogen response, f(N) is assumed\nto be nonlimiting, i.e. the sward always has adequate\nnutrition. The temperature response function, f(T), is\ntaken to be linear between 5 and 20 \u00b0C, above which it is\nnonlimiting. No growth is assumed to take place in any\nyear until the temperature sum reaches 200 day \u00b0C above\n0, from 1st January.\nThe rate at which a grass crop can intercept radiation is\na function of the leaf area index for which the crop\nweight is used as a proxy. When radiation is nonlimiting,\nthe growth rate, f(W) depends on the crop weight:\nf \u0085JW\u0086 \u0088 f \u0085W\u0086 \u0088 1\u00ff fW \u00ffWopt\u0086=Woptg2; \u00852\u0086\nwhere the optimum crop weight, Wopt is 5 t ha\n\u00b11 (Dowle\n& Armstrong 1990). When crop weight is nonlimiting,\nbut radiation is limited, the radiation limitation, f(J) is\ngiven by a similar function:\nf \u0085JW\u0086 \u0088 f \u0085J\u0086 \u0088 1\u00ff f\u0085J \u00ff Jopt\u0086=optg2: \u00853\u0086\nWhen both are limiting, f(JW) is the product of f(J) and\nf(W). Grazing or cutting reduces the photosynthetic\nef\u00aeciency of the crop, by reducing the crop weight,\nhence the need to include utilization as a component of\nSWARD. The inclusion of crop removal in SWARD\nensures that grass management is an integral part of the\nmodel, which makes it ideal for inclusion in the\nintegrated grass growth and utilization model required\nfor this work.\nGrass growth is limited both by water in excess (water\nlogging) and by water shortage (drought) expressed as a\nfunction f(B). The rate of growth is unlimited between\n\u00aeeld capacity and wilting point, but declines linearly\noutside these bounds, ceasing completely at both satura-\ntion and PWP. The interaction between grass growth rate\nand water shortage mirrors the reduction in actual\nevapotranspiration, and the model thus explicitly links\nthe growth of grass to transpiration rate.\nThe quality of herbage is estimated using the model\ndescribed by Edelsten & Corrall (1979). Digestibility of\nFig. 1 Schematic diagram of the grazing animal integrated model.\nG R A Z I N G S Y S T E M S M O D E L S F O R C L I M A T E C H A N G E S T U D I E S 95\n# 2001 Blackwell Science Ltd, Global Change Biology, 7, 93\u00b1112\ncut sward harvested on day i is predicted from the\nequation:\nD \u0088 73:6\u0087 2:5 sin 2\u0019i\n365\n\u0087 1:6 cos 2\u0019i\n365\n\u00ff 0:018j\u00ff 0:715yh\n\u00854\u0086\nwhere D is the digestible organic matter (% of total dry\nmatter), j is the number of days since the previous\nharvest, and yh is the amount at the previous harvest (t\nha\u00b11)\nA similar model of sward quality was not available for\ngrazed swards. However, data from the North Wyke\ngrazing experiment (Tyson et al. 1993) showed similar\npatterns to those predicted by the Edelsten & Corrall\nequation. Because the modelled swards included a\nmixture of both grazing and cutting, the Edelsten &\nCorral relationship was used throughout, in order to\npreserve a consistent estimate of digestibility values\nthroughout the year. No attempt has been made to\npredict the effects of either temperature or drought on\nforage digestibility. The reduction in forage quality and\npalatability resulting from a change in the carbon to\nnitrogen ratios reported by Allen-Diaz (1996) affected\nlow-latitude rangelands, and are thought not to be a\nproblem for UK grassland, and so is not considered here.\nLivestock feeding models\nAll the ruminant feeding models concentrate on energy\nmetabolism using the factorial approach (AFRC 1993).\nThe total intake is calculated as a function of the diet\ndigestibility and the animals' liveweight and (for dairy\ncows) milk yield. This typically has the form\nx \u0088 aw0:75; \u00855\u0086\nwhere x is intake (kg DM d\u00b11), w is liveweight (kg) and\nthe coef\u00aecient a increases with digestibility.\nThe total metabolizable energy requirement, E(MJ d\u00b11)\nis the sum of the components\nE \u0088 SEi \u0088 Sei=ki; \u00856\u0086\nwhere the components are maintenance, growth, preg-\nnancy and lactation, denoted by subscripts m, g, p and l,\nrespectively. The coef\u00aecients ki are the empirically\nderived conversion ef\u00aeciencies from metabolizable en-\nergy in the feed to energy deposited or utilized by the\nanimal. If the total energy intake exceeds the require-\nment, the rate of weight gain is increased and conversely\nprovided the metabolic requirements (maintenance,\npregnancy and lactation) are met. If the intake is\ninsuf\u00aecient to meet the metabolic requirements, that is\nall except growth, fat reserves will be mobilized to\nsupply the shortfall.\nThe energy deposited as body tissue, foetal tissue and\nmilk is considered to be retained. The rest forms the\nmetabolic heat production Q:\nQ \u0088 Em \u0087 Eg\u00851\u00ff kg\u0086 \u0087 Ep\u00851\u00ff kp\u0086 \u0087 El\u00851\u00ff kl\u0086: \u00857\u0086\nThe beef calf and lamb models consider only main-\ntenance and growth. In the case of the lamb, the model\nincludes the transition from milk to grass, whereas the\nbeef calf is assumed to be weaned and grown from 50 kg\nto about 500 kg over a period of up to two years on a\ngrass and concentrates diet.\nThe ewe and the dairy cow models both include\npregnancy and lactation because they represent signi\u00ae-\ncant energy demands in certain periods. The energy\nrequired for lactation El is assumed to be proportional to\nthe milk yield. In the case of the dairy cow, lactation\nfollows a standard curve (Wood 1969), whereas for the\newe it is determined by the requirements of her\noffspring. The requirement for pregnancy (development\nof the placenta and foetus) follows a Gompertz curve.\nThermal model for ruminants\nKnowledge of the thermal status of livestock, and the\ninteraction between animal and environment, is essential\nfor the formulation of any model of a livestock system.\nThe general effects of weather conditions on the thermal\nbalance of animals are well documented. Low tempera-\ntures, high winds or wetting of the animal reduce the\ngrowth rate (Close 1987) and the feed intake required for\nmaintenance increases (Thompson 1973). Combinations\nof cold and wet conditions can cause death from\nhypothermia (e.g. Glass & Jacob 1991). Hot weather also\nhas adverse effects. Heat stress reduces feed intake and\nthe digestibility of the food (Bianca 1965), depresses milk\nproduction, affects the ovulation cycle and increases\nembryo mortality (Bianca 1965; Close 1987). The water\nrequirement also increases. In addition to adversely\naffecting economic productivity, the animal's welfare\nsuffers under thermal stress.\nThere are several models in existence dealing with the\nenergy balance of homeotherms (e.g. Bruce & Clark 1979;\nStafford Smith et al. 1985; McArthur 1987; Higgins &\nDodd 1989). Most are either simple empirical models\nwith meteorological data as inputs, or more detailed\nmechanistic models with idealized inputs. The aim of the\ncurrent work was to combine these two approaches and\nproduce a physically based model based on established\nprinciples of energy transfer and animal physiology. The\nprincipal outputs are the energy requirement for a\nspeci\u00aeed hourly period, and a quanti\u00aecation of the\n96 D . J . P A R S O N S et al.\n# 2001 Blackwell Science Ltd, Global Change Biology, 7, 93\u00b1112\ndegree of thermal stress suffered, given the meteorolo-\ngical conditions.\nThe model was developed to predict the heat loss from\na single animal, in steady state under speci\u00aeed meteor-\nological conditions, Turnpenny et al. (2000a,b). The\nruminant model was based on a system of round-ended\ncylinders with a layer of outer insulation to represent the\ncoat (McArthur & Monteith 1980). This model consisted\nof a core producing heat and demanding feed energy,\nsurrounded by three layers: the peripheral tissue, the\ncoat and the outside environment. Because the feed\nmodel \u00aexes the metabolic rate, the heat balance of the\nanimal was solved assuming no heat was stored in any of\nthe three layers. The total energy \u00afux through each layer\nis therefore equal in a steady state, by the law of\nconservation of energy. Thus the heat balance for the\ncylinder can be written as:\nEnergy Loss From Each Part \u0088\nConduction Through Tissue \u0088 \u00858\u0086\nCoat Transfer\u0087 Surface Evaporation \u0088\nConvection\u0087 Thermal Radiation\u0087 Evaporation\u00ff\nSolar Radiation\nThe heat transfer through each layer can be written in\nterms of a simple Ohm's Law analogy, which relates heat\n\u00afux density to temperature difference:\nheat flux density \/ \u0085temperature difference\u0086=resistance:\n\u00859\u0086\nHeat \u00afux density has units of W m\u00b12, and is obtained\nby dividing the heat \u00afux by the area over which heat\ntransfer takes place. For the model the appropriate\nsurface is the skin surface area of the body. Thermal\nresistance has units of s m\u00b11. The constant of proportion-\nality is the volumetric speci\u00aec heat of air, which is about\n1220 J m\u00b13 K\u00b11 at 20 \u00b0C (Gates 1980). The energy balance\nequation (8), was solved using iteration to calculate the\ntemperatures at the layer interfaces (skin and coat\nsurfaces), the resistance to each transfer process through\neach layer, and hence the total heat loss from the animal.\nFor outdoor animals, solar radiation, rainfall and wind\nspeed are all important weather inputs. Solar radiation\nabsorbed by animals can exceed four times maintenance\nthermoneutral heat production (Clapperton et al. 1965),\nwhile a thoroughly wet coat can decrease the external\nresistance of the animal to heat transfer by up to 30%\n(Mount & Brown 1982; McArthur 1991). A strong wind\ncan penetrate the deepest coat, reducing its insulation\nsubstantially. The parameterizations of these weather\nvariables in the thermal balance model are discussed in\ndetail in Turnpenny (1997).\nIn the thermoneutral zone, an animal has to\ndissipate a minimum amount of heat, produced by\nmetabolization of its food intake (Mount 1979; Parsons\n1993). If the environmental demand for heat is greater\nor less than the thermoneutral metabolic heat produc-\ntion, homeotherms must employ physiological and\/or\nbehavioural methods to balance heat loss with the\nmetabolic rate, and thus preserve homeothermy.\nIn hot conditions the environmental demand is less\nthan the thermoneutral heat production. The animal\nmust then increase the heat loss to the environment.\nOne method employed is vasomotor control of\nperipheral blood \u00afow. Other mechanisms to enhance\nheat loss are panting, which increases the evaporative\nheat loss from the respiratory tract, and sweating,\nwhich increases evaporative heat loss from the skin.\nExperimental data and analysis indicate that animals\nregulate sensible heat loss (i.e. convection and radia-\ntion) in preference to evaporative heat loss. The\nimplication is that an animal will use vasomotor\ncontrol before panting, as increasing evaporative loss\ninvolves loss of water and, at high rates of panting, an\nincrease in metabolic rate. These are both costly to the\nanimal. In the current thermal balance model, vaso-\nmotor control of blood \u00afow is parameterized by\nallowing a variable tissue resistance in the legs of\nthe sheep and trunk of the cow (Blaxter et al. 1959).\nThe resistance value was chosen by the model to force\nheat loss to equal heat production. When blood \u00afow\nis at a maximum, the sheep model used panting to\ndissipate the excess heat loss (Alexander 1974). The\nrespiration rate was calculated from empirical equa-\ntions derived from data in Hales & Webster (1967).\nThe cow uses sweating rather than panting to\ndissipate excess heat, and latent heat loss from the\nskin was increased accordingly in the model.\nWhen heat loss to the environment is greater than the\nthermoneutral metabolic heat production, homeotherms\nwill respond by increasing metabolic rate (e.g. by\nshivering or movement). Shivering decreases the tissue\nresistance by up to 30% (Blaxter et al. 1959), but the\nbene\u00aet from increasing the heat production (by up to six\ntimes the thermoneutral value in humans (Parsons 1993))\noutweighs the decrease in resistance. Shivering is\nparameterized in the model by reducing the tissue\nresistance of the trunk from the thermoneutral value\n(taken as 100 s m\u00b11) to a value which maintains energy\nbalance. Maximal shivering is assumed to occur when\nthe tissue resistance is 70% of the thermoneutral level\n(Blaxter et al. 1959). In very cold conditions, vasomotor\ncontrol is used to prevent freezing of the tissue of the\nextremities. If the skin temperature of the leg or head\nG R A Z I N G S Y S T E M S M O D E L S F O R C L I M A T E C H A N G E S T U D I E S 97\n# 2001 Blackwell Science Ltd, Global Change Biology, 7, 93\u00b1112\nfalls below 5 \u00b0C, the tissue resistance will fall to maintain\nthe skin temperature at 5 \u00b0C.\nThermal balance model for naturally ventilated\nbuildings\nIn the UK, most livestock are housed either periodically\nor year-round in livestock buildings in order to manage\nthem better and protect them from the weather. In order\nto assess the effect of climatic change on grassland and\nlivestock systems accurately we must therefore model\nthe animals' interaction with their housing. Unsuitable\nmicroclimates may result in thermal stress of the animals,\nwith consequent losses in production and risks to\nwelfare. In the main, pigs and poultry are housed in\ncontrolled environment buildings whilst sheep and cattle\nare periodically housed in naturally ventilated buildings.\nNaturally ventilated buildings are generally poorly\ninsulated, with part of their walls open. Thus ventilation\nconsists of thermally induced and wind-driven compo-\nnents. There are many different types of these buildings\nand many speci\u00aec buildings have been modelled in the\npast (for example, Bruce 1974). We wished to keep the\nmodel as general as possible whilst still giving realistic\nrepresentations of the buildings' mean internal tempera-\nture. The model calculates steady-state heat balances\nevery hour, combining estimates of wind, thermal\nbuoyancy effects and solar radiation based on estab-\nlished work cited below.\nThe model is based on the heat balance equation\n(Charles 1981),\nQ \u0088 cVDT \u0087UADT; \u008510\u0086\nwhere Q is the sensible heat output per animal (W); c is\nthe volumetric heat capacity of air (J m\u00b13 K\u00b11); V is the\nventilation rate per animal (m3 s\u00b11); U is the average\nthermal transmittance of walls and roof (W m\u00b12 K\u00b11); A is\nthe exposed area of walls and roof per animal (m2); and\nDT is the temperature lift above the external temperature\n(K). The sensible heat output of the animal is calculated\nin the feeding model described above.\nThe ventilation term in the above equation is a\ncombination of wind-forced ventilation and buoyancy\neffect ventilation, caused by differences in internal and\nexternal pressure (Cooper et al. 1998). For simplicity, the\nturbulent effect of air entering is ignored and we assume\nthat air only enters by the windward walls.\nAll the building surfaces are heated by radiation and\ncooled by convection. The intensity of the radiation on\nany surface will depend upon the angle of incidence of\nthe sun's rays and the observed radiation. The model\ncalculates the direct and diffuse radiation on each of the\nsurfaces of the building. The contributions of radiation\nand convection are combined in the `sol-air temperature'\n(Owen 1994). If the net radiation on the surface of the\nbuilding wall is suf\u00aeciently high, the surface of the\nbuilding will conduct this net heat \u00afux through the wall\ninto the building.\nUnder the steady-state assumption, the resulting total\n\u00afux at the surface of the building is equal to the\nconduction term in (10), so may be substituted for it.\nThe result is a cubic equation for the temperature rise in\nterms of the weather variables, which may be solved\nanalytically, avoiding the need for numerical solution of\na system of nonlinear equations. This model has been\ntested for a typical calf house and found to give a good\nprediction of the hourly mean internal temperature. (Full\ndetails in Cooper et al. 1998.)\nWeather generators\nIn order to apply the models, it is necessary to have long\nand realistic sequences of meteorological data. Although\nthese could be derived from current meteorological\nrecords for the present climate, the required data cannot\nin principle be so derived for the future. Some scheme\nmust be chosen to generate plausible weather data for\nfuture climates.\nOf the various possibilities, the use of a stochastic\nweather generator was adopted. This gives the \u00afexibility\nof generating virtually in\u00aenite sequences of weather data\nfor any scenario, including the current climate. In order\nto maintain comparability, the same weather generator\nmust be used for both current and changed climates.\nFigure 2 shows a schematic representation of the weather\ngenerator.\nThe scheme for deriving the data consists of three\nparts:\n1 The estimation of current climatic parameters for\ninput into the weather generator. Detailed meteorological\nobservations recorded at eight ADAS experimental sites\nthroughout UK were used to de\u00aene the monthly means\nand distribution statistics for the EPIC weather generator\n(Richardson & Nicks 1990), using the program imported\nand modi\u00aeed from the EPIC package (Sharpley &\nWilliams 1990).\n2 Spatially variable estimates of climate means were\nextracted from UK baseline climatology and for climate\nchange scenarios within the SPECTRE package using the\nUKHI global circulation model results and `medium'\nCO2 sensitivity (Barrow et al. 1994) on a 10\u00a2 resolution.\nData are available for the six IPCC 1992 scenarios and the\nUK Met Of\u00aece transient dataset up to the year 2100. The\ndataset consists of the following variables on a monthly\nbasis: maximum temperature, minimum temperature,\nmean temperature, diurnal temperature range, precipita-\ntion, incident solar radiation, vapour pressure and wind\n98 D . J . P A R S O N S et al.\n# 2001 Blackwell Science Ltd, Global Change Biology, 7, 93\u00b1112\nspeed. Changes in the other parameters of the climate\n(such as the transition parameters for the rain day\nMarkov chain) which are currently not available from the\nGCM models, are taken unchanged from the analysis of\ncurrent data.\n3 These sources of data are integrated by the EPIC\ndaily weather generator (Richardson & Nicks 1990)\nwhich is itself derived from Richardson (1981). Each\nsection of the generator has a local mean value de\u00aened\nfrom the baseline climatology, a perturbation component\nderived from SPECTRE and a set of distribution and\ntransition parameters derived from the current dataset.\nIn the weather generator, the de\u00aening stage of\ngenerating weather sequences is the establishment of a\n\u00aerst-order Markov chain describing the sequence of rain\ndays. On each wet day the precipitation amount is\nsampled from a skewed normal distribution. Maximum\nand minimum daily temperatures are generated as\nresiduals from the monthly means using the weekly\nstationary generating process of Matalas (1967). The\nwind speed component is generated from a two-\nparameter gamma distribution; the vapour pressures\nfrom a triangular distribution; and wind direction from\nthe probabilities compiled for each month. The set of\nvalues is then input into a Penman\u00b1Monteith equation to\ncalculate daily reference evapotranspiration (ET0).\nAlthough the EPIC generator has been used success-\nfully for many studies in the USA, its applicability to the\nUK is less certain. It is included in the SSLRC SEISMIC\ndatabase system (Hallett et al. 1992; Hollis et al. 1993).\nHowever, it has been observed that although it predicts\nthe means of rainfall distributions quite well, it under-\npredicts the frequency of rare events such as the high-\nintensity rainfalls that might generate erosion events\n(Favis-Mortlock 1995).\nThe generated daily values are subsequently scaled\ndown to hourly values (Turnpenny 1997). Air tempera-\nture, precipitation, direct and diffuse solar radiation,\nradiant temperature of the sky and ground temperature\nare calculated from the daily values using empirical\nrelationships. Vapour pressure, wind speed and wind\ndirection are assumed constant over the day.\nTable 1 shows the annual mean temperature and\nrainfall for each site currently and as predicted by the\nclimate change models for three scenarios for the year\n2050. These scenarios are taken from the report of the\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 1992)\nand represent `business as usual' (IS92a), low economic\nFig. 2 Overview of the weather generator system.\nTable 1 Annual mean temperature and rainfall for baseline\nand climate change scenarios\nBoxworth Cheshire Pwllpeiran\nTemp.

The\ndifferences between the three scenarios are small by this\ndate. It is only towards the end of the next century that\nthe differences between scenarios become signi\u00aecant.\nTable 2 shows the monthly means used in the calibration\nof the weather generator. These are shown for Boxworth\nonly to illustrate the seasonal pattern of the changes.\nThey show an increase both in temperatures and rainfall\namounts.\nIntegrated model\nModel structure\nIn order to evaluate the performance of livestock systems\nunder future climatic scenarios the individual submodels\nneed to be combined. The interaction between the\nmodels is shown in Fig. 1. At the start of each day the\ngrass growth and the animals' intake requirements of\nconcentrates and grass or silage are calculated, and the\nappropriate forage pool is adjusted appropriately. Forage\nshortages are recorded as an indicator of potential\nproblems. The metabolic heat production, treated as a\nconstant for the day, is calculated and fed to the animal\nheat balance model. The other inputs to this model come\nfrom the weather, if necessary modi\u00aeed by the building\nheat balance model. Both of the heat balance models\noperate on an hourly time step, and calculate the thermal\nbalance, including stresses experienced throughout the\nday.\nHeat stress in animals reduces their appetite and\nconsequently their food intake. This may lead to a\nreduction in milk yield, reproductive ef\u00aeciency, and\nincreased embryo mortality in the dairy cow and ewe.\nThe lamb and beef calf will grow at a slower rate if\nstressed. There are few detailed experimental studies of\nthe effects of periods and degrees of heat stress that are\nsuitable for this model. Studies in which animals were\nexposed to high levels of stress for several hours per day,\nfor example Senft & Rittenhouse (1985), show reductions\nin intake of up to 15%. For the purposes of the model it\nwas assumed that intake was reduced by 2% for each\nhour of severe stress, up to a maximum of 16%. The\nmetabolic energy available for growth is consequently\nreduced for the beef calf and lamb. For the ewe and dairy\ncow it is slightly more complicated as the animal may be\nusing energy for pregnancy or lactation, as well as\nmaintenance and growth. The loss in metabolic energy is\nallocated in the following order: (i) the energy for\nlactation is reduced; (ii) the energy for growth is reduced;\n(iii) the energy for pregnancy is reduced; and (iv) the\nanimal loses weight.\nThe sheep model runs for one year from 1st January to\n31st December, the dairy cow model includes an\nadditional run-in period for the grass model only from\n1st January until the start of grazing, then runs for a year,\nand the beef calf typically takes 18 months to 2 years to\nreach a mature weight.\nInputs to ECCLIPS\nECCLIPS (Effect of Climate Change on Livestock\nProduction Systems) uses the inputs de\u00aened for all the\ncomponent models.

This includes the number of \u00aeelds and the dates\nto cut for silage, start and end grazing for each \u00aeeld. The\ndairy cow and beef calf are brought out and returned to\nhousing according to the cutting and grazing routine.\nThe calving pattern for the dairy cow can be set to\nsimulate different systems; this study assumed calving at\nthe beginning of September. A typical cutting and\ngrazing routine for the beef calf, which may be kept for\nup to 24 months, is shown in Table 3.\nOutput\nAll the component models provide yearly and daily\noutput. The yearly output provides `risk' and `produc-\ntivity' variables. These outputs are yield, intake, \u00aenal\nweight, buffer feed requirement, frequency of stress and\nnumber of hours the ventilation system is unable to keep\nthe internal temperature within the animals' thermo-\nneutral zone. The buffer feed requirement is the shortfall\nin feeding when the available silage (in the winter) or the\ngrass on the \u00aeelds (in the summer) is insuf\u00aecient.\nComputing aspects\nThe programs were written in fortran for the Microsoft\nMSDOSTM operating system, with a graphics program\nwritten for Microsoft WindowsTM used to display the\nresults.

The output \u00aeles available include complete sets of\ndaily and hourly results from the component models,\nand annual summaries for complete sets of runs.\nResults\nResults are presented for each of the enterprise types in a\ncommon format: a table of the main variables that\ndescribe the systems, a table of the main performance\nmeasures, and a discussion of the main points. More\ndetailed results for the dairy and beef systems are\npresented graphically; the sheep systems showed gen-\nerally the same pattern as beef, but with smaller year-to-\nyear variations. The graphs show the gross margin, heat\nstress and yield of primary product for all the years in\nthe simulation, ranked by the value of the dependent\nvariable for each scenario. These are similar to the\nstochastic dominance plots commonly used in decision\nanalysis, in which cumulative frequency is plotted\nagainst the measure of performance (i.e. the transpose\nof the axes used here). It provides an informative\ncomparison of the differences between two series in\nwhich the inherent variability is large and there are no\nmeaningful paired samples. If one line lies always above\nthe other, it may be said to dominate it, in the sense that\nany given value of the variable will be exceeded more\nfrequently in that series than the other. It also provides a\nclear visualization of how frequently a given value is\nexceeded, which is particularly relevant when consider-\ning heat stress. In addition to the results for the\nindividual enterprises, there is a more detailed discus-\nsion of the likely effects of climate change on grassland\nsystems generally. The results are shown for scenario\nIS92a in the year 2050 only, because it was found that the\nvariation in impacts between scenarios a, c and f was\nalways negligible, as would be expected from the small\ndifferences in climatic data in Table 1. The gross margin\ncalculations use current prices to represent the \u00aenancial\nsituation if there were no changes in the relative prices of\nall inputs and outputs. In order to use a consistent set of\ncommodity prices, the prices for beef are those prior to\nthe depression in the market caused by measures to\ncontrol BSE in the UK, and other recent falls in\nagricultural commodity prices.\nAs far as possible the farming scenarios were chosen to\nre\u00afect typical current farming practice, and the model\ngenerally gave realistic gross margins for the baseline\nconditions. However, there were a few cases where it\nwas not possible to achieve this and compromises had to\nbe made. This was usually because of problems in\nmatching the inputs and outputs of the feeding and\nthermal balance models: there is little recent experimen-\ntal work, and none in which both aspects were studied in\ndetail. Most of the data used in developing and testing\nthe thermal balance model therefore re\u00afect lower growth\nrates or yields than would be expected today. The\nstocking rates were not changed between the baseline\nand 2050a scenarios, although the grass yields often\nchanged. Instead, the stocking rate with the baseline\nclimate was set to require buffer feeding with externally\nproduced forage in some years (included as a variable\ncost). Productivity changes are thus detected as changes\nin the requirements for buffer feeding.\nTable 5 Main input variables for beef scenarios\nBoxworth Cheshire Pwllpeiran\nNumber of calves 240 240 180\nDuration of model run (d) 550 550 550\nInitial liveweight (kg) 50 50 50\nTarget liveweight (kg) 400 400 400\nTotal grass area (ha) 60 60 60\nFertilizer applied (kgN ha\u00b11) 200 200 200\nTable 6 Performance measures for beef scenarios [mean (SD)]\nBoxworth Cheshire Pwllpeiran\nBaseline IS92a Baseline IS92a Baseline IS92a\nFinal weight (kg) 407 (3) 403 (3) 419 (5) 417 (4) 375 (5) 372 (14)\nForage intake (kg) 1792 (15) 1772 (16) 1861 (32) 1851 (33) 1539 (137) 1512 (140)\nConcentrate intake (kg\/calf) 392 (3) 392 (3) 411 (25) 413 (25) 626 (103) 635 (106)\nGrass DM yield (t ha\u00b11) 7.0 (1.1) 7.6 (1.1) 7.3 (0.6) 7.85 (0.6) 4.2 (1.2) 4.4 (1.2)\nSevere stress (h y\u00b11) 552 (75) 636 (79) 145 (44) 188 (52) 394 (59) 459 (61)\nGross margin (\u00a3\/calf) 220 (9) 219 (5) 230 (10) 229 (8) 122 (56) 119 (556)\n102 D .

Some,\nfor example panting, can be observed but others cannot.\nThere are no \u00aeeld data with which to make comparisons,\nso the present levels are unknown. We proceed on the\nassumption that present levels are tolerable, but that\nsubstantial increases would be unacceptable. This is\ncertainly the case for broilers, where mortality rates\nalready increase during warm summers.\nDespite these limitations, the baseline results do show\nrealistic patterns, as shown by the comparison between\nthe sites. For all of the grass-based enterprises, Cheshire,\none of the largest dairy and beef producing regions,\nshows the highest productivity, resulting from high grass\nyields. Pwllpeiran, currently a marginal area, has the\nlowest productivity, but continues to be used for less\nintensive livestock production because it is unsuitable for\nother enterprises.

First, the data are the\nresults of deterministic models acting on data generated\nby stochastic weather generators, so they have unusual\nstatistical properties. Secondly, there are dependencies\nbetween years in the different scenarios, invalidating the\nindependence assumptions on which conventional ana-\nlyses are based. In general, the results obtained actually\nhave greater signi\u00aecance than would be indicated by\nhypothesis testing, because a change in the mean value is\nan indication of a change in the whole distribution. Thus,\nfor example, a 20% increase in the mean frequency of\nheat stress with no change in the variance also implies a\n20% increase in the upper quartile, and so on.\nGrass production\nThe grass crop is fundamental to the three ruminant\nproduction systems considered, so to avoid repetition,\nFig. 5 Results of beef cattle simulation for 30 years at Cheshire, comparing baseline (1997) and modi\u00aeed (2050 IS92a) climates, ranked\nby the dependent variable: (a) Gross margin, (b) Frequency of severe heat stress, and (c) Final weight. d, 1997; m, 2050a.\n104 D .

For this analysis, but not in the model runs, the\nstart of the grazing season was de\u00aened to be the \u00aerst day\nafter 1 March when the soil water fell to 10 mm below\n\u00aeeld capacity. The end was the \u00aerst day after 31 August\nwhen it returned to that level. Upper bounds were set\n60 days after those dates to handle exceptional cases. The\nother measure is the number of days for which the soil\nwater content fell below the wilting point. This is the\npoint at which water stress begins to limit grass growth,\nso it is a good measure of the effect of water on\nproductivity and of the risk of drought.\nTable 4 shows a strong site effect, with the dry lowland\narea (Boxworth) having the longest grazing season, but\nalso the longest wilting duration, while the upland site\nhas the shortest season and the shortest wilting duration.\nBy these criteria, the grazing season at Pwllpeiran, which\nFig. 6 Results of beef cattle simulation for 30 years at Pwllpeiron, comparing baseline (1997) and modi\u00aeed (2050 IS92a) climates,\nranked by the dependent variable: (a) Gross margin, (b) Frequency of severe heat stress, and (c) Final weight. d, 1997; m, 2050a.\nG R A Z I N G S Y S T E M S M O D E L S F O R C L I M A T E C H A N G E S T U D I E S 105\n# 2001 Blackwell Science Ltd, Global Change Biology, 7, 93\u00b1112\nhas very high rainfall, was frequently the shortest period\nallowed by the analysis, and turnout never occurred\nbefore the latest possible date. The criteria used are\nprobably too strict for the less intensive farming\npractised in such areas.\nThe effect of climate change on these measures is\nminimal. The one substantial change shown, in the\nminimum grazing season for Boxworth, is the conse-\nquence of a very small change in soil moisture content\ncausing it to reach the end of season threshold much\nlater. The increase in rainfall predicted for all three\nregions in IS92a is offset by increased evapotranspiration\ncaused by the increased temperature. These results are\ncounterintuitive, but can be explained by examination of\nthe weather data. The climate predictions derived from\nthe IS92 scenarios as described above, show an increase\nin summer precipitation of up to 8%. No data were\navailable on the likely frequency of prolonged dry spells,\nso these could not be included.\nThe results for grass yield have been presented in the\nsections for the two cattle enterprises. They show yield\nincreases of about 9% at Boxworth, 7% in Cheshire and\n5% at Pwllpeiran, which bring the yields at Boxworth to\nthe level of present yields in Cheshire. The increases in\nyield are the result of having a temperature rise without\na signi\u00aecant change in water stress. Figure 3 shows how\nthe distribution of yields changes, illustrating that a\nsmall increase in the mean yield represents a signi\u00aecant\nincrease in the frequency of high yields. Previous studies\n(Armstrong & Castle, 1995; Armstrong et al. 1995) have\nindicated that these increases in yield will be concen-\ntrated in the early part of the growing season.\nThe direct fertilization of grass production by the\nincrease in CO2 concentration is likely to reinforce the\nobservation that climate change will lead to an increase\nin total grass growth, an observation supported\nby experimental evidence (e.g. Jones et al. 1996;\nSchapendonk et al. 1996; Warwick et al. 1998). However,\nexisting models (e.g. Stockle et al. 1992) would apply the\nsame rate of change to all locations and all seasons within\nthe UK, and so just change the absolute amount of grass\ngrown; but have no effect on the relative rates of growth\nbetween sites or within years.\nBeef calves\nThe beef enterprise was simulated for all three sites\n(Tables 5 and 6, Figs 4, 5 and 6), though the stocking rate\nat Pwllpeiran was lower that at the other two because of\nthe lower carrying capacity of grassland in upland areas.\nEven so, the target weight was rarely achieved at\nPwllpeiran. The results from this site also exhibited\nmuch greater variability than the others.

These reduced the total con-\nsumption of buffer feed by over half at both lowland\nsites.\nThe frequency of heat stress increased by only about\n15% at Boxworth and Pwllpeiran, but by 30% in\nCheshire. However, this large relative increase was a\nresult of the very low baseline level of stress at this site,\nand the total remained much lower than the baseline\nlevel for Boxworth. The higher values for Pwllpeiran,\nFig. 7 Results of dairy cow simulation for 30 years at Boxworth, comparing baseline (1997) and modi\u00aeed (2050 IS92a) climates,\nranked by the dependent variable: (a) Gross margin, (b) Frequency of severe heat stress, and (c) Final weight. d, 1997; m, 2050a.\nG R A Z I N G S Y S T E M S M O D E L S F O R C L I M A T E C H A N G E S T U D I E S 107\n# 2001 Blackwell Science Ltd, Global Change Biology, 7, 93\u00b1112\ndespite slightly lower temperatures than Cheshire, result\nfrom the smaller size of the animals, and hence reduced\nsurface area for heat dissipation. The effects of the\nincreases in stress on overall intake and growth were\nvery small, because prolonged stress is required to\nproduce a signi\u00aecant reduction. The resulting changes\nin mean gross margin were small, but there was a clear\ndifference in the pattern between Pwllpeiran (Fig. 6a) and\nthe other sites (Figs 4a and 5a). The increase in variability\nunder the changed climate causes the lines to cross in the\nmiddle of the range, which represents an increase in the\nriskiness of the enterprise. At the other two sites there are\nonly a few poor years and very little difference between\nthe scenarios.\nIn general, we conclude that the expected changes in\nclimate are well within the calves' range of natural\nadaptation, especially outside the south-east, and are\nunlikely to cause serious problems of stress.

There was no\nchange in the relative suitability of the three regions for\nthis enterprise.\nDairy cows\nThe dairy enterprise was simulated for the Boxworth and\nCheshire sites (Tables 7 and 8, Figs 7 and 8). The grass at\nPwllpeiran is generally not of high enough quality to\nconsider grazing dairy cows there and the topography is\nunsuitable. The grass yield and quality were higher in\nCheshire than at Boxworth and consequently stocking\nrates of 1.67 cows ha\u00b11 and 2 cows ha\u00b11 were used for\nBoxworth and Cheshire, respectively. In general, the\nresults of the dairy cow simulation runs agreed with\nthose for the beef calves. The two sites give similar\nresults, with the grass yield, gross margin and other\nproduction variables higher for Cheshire, as expected. In\nCheshire, the gross margins for 2050 dominate (Fig. 8a).\nAt Boxworth this is true for most of the range, although\nthe highest margins occur in a few years of the present\nclimate (Fig. 7a). The mean grass yield increased by about\n7%, indicating the potential for slightly higher stocking\nrates to be supported. This was re\u00afected in a reduction of\nabout 30% in buffer feeding at both sites.\nThe mean milk yield, \u00aenal weight and forage intake\ndecreased slightly and Figs 7(c) and 8(c) show that yield\nunder the baseline climate dominates the changed\nclimate.\nThe predicted heat stress incidence Cheshire was\nabout a third of that at Boxworth. This was the result\nof a lower average temperature in Cheshire, with many\nfewer temperatures in the 20\u00b130 \u00b0C range. The frequency\nof heat stress increased by 10% and 20% for Boxworth\nand Cheshire, respectively. At both sites (Figs 7b and 8b)\nthe 2050 results dominate.\nThe dairy cow should have no major problems\nadapting to the expected changes in climate, although\nin warmer regions the cows may bene\u00aet from the\nprovision of shade. The farmer may bene\u00aet from\nincreases in grass production allowing higher stocking\nrates. There was no change in the relative suitability of\nCheshire and Boxworth for dairy cows.\nSheep\nThe sheep enterprise was simulated for all three sites\nwith the same stocking rate for each (Tables 9 and 10). As\nbefore the in\u00afuence of the different climate scenarios on\nthe gross margin and other factors was marginal.\nFor all three sites the incidence of heat stress on the\newe increased by approximately 20%. The frequency of\nthe heat stress for the lamb was less severe than for the\newe and was only 16 h per year for the baseline climate in\nCheshire. However, this stress frequency almost doubled\nunder the climate change scenario. Thus, on certain days,\nheat stress may cause a problem for the lamb. The\nfrequency of heat stress was largest at Boxworth and\nleast in Cheshire, as for the beef calf.\nThe increase in heat stress caused a marginal reduction\nin forage intake and \u00aenal lamb weight. It also resulted in\na 6% reduction in the \u00aenal weight of the ewe.\nIn conclusion, climate change should present no\nserious adaptation problems for the lamb or ewe.\nFurthermore the relative suitability of the three regions\nfor sheep farming remains unchanged. However, more\nprovision should be made to protect the animals from\ndirect sun on hot days.\nDiscussion\nLimitations of the models and the study\nThe models developed for this study are the \u00aerst to\nattempt to combine the four processes of crop produc-\ntion, animal feeding, animal thermal balance and build-\ning environment into integrated models.

Further\ninvestigation of management responses to climate\nchange, such as change in stocking rate, production\nlevels and ventilation, are also needed.\nConclusions\n1 Ruminants at grass or in naturally ventilated build-\nings should be able to adapt easily to the expected\nchanges in climate and there is no evidence of change in\nthe relative suitability of the areas considered for the\nmajor types of livestock enterprises.\n2 Assuming that there is no change in the relative\nprices of inputs and outputs, the net change in pro\u00aet-\nability is likely to be small but positive.\n3 The results suggest that climate change would result\nin a modest increase in grass production. Although the\npresent model did not fully exploit this, because it used\n\u00aexed stocking rates, there was a reduction in the\nfrequency with which buffer feeding was required for\nboth cattle enterprises. It is anticipated that increased\nstocking rates to make use of this increased production\nwill be possible.\nAcknowledgements\nThis project was funded by the UK Ministry of Agriculture,\nFisheries and Food under the Impacts of Climate Change research\nprogramme, as contract CSA2523\/CC0315.
