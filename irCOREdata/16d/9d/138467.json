Approximately 81% of borehole\nsamples were recorded as exhibiting between zero and 10 thermotolerant\ncoliforms\/100ml (hereafter reported as colony forming units - cfu\/100ml), while only\n29% of samples from household stored water were recorded in this range, and 20%\nexceeded 1,000 cfu\/100ml.\nMost literature on the subject of water quality deterioration either offers no explanation\nfor the cause (Rajasekaran et al, 1977; Han et al, 1989; Morin et al, 1990; Simango et al,\n1992; Genthe et al, 1997), or suggests that it results from poor water handling without\nsubstantiating this assertion (Shiffman et al, 1978; El Attar et al, 1982; Khairy et al,\n1982; Heinanen et al, 1988; Blum et al, 1990; Verweij et al, 1991). Other studies have\nconcentrated more on how to prevent water quality deterioration through the\nintroduction of improved collection and\/or storage containers (Deb et al, 1986;\nEmpereuur-Bissonnet et al, 1992; Mintz et al, 1995; Roberts et al, 2001).\nGenerally, post-supply water quality deterioration has been assumed to result from\ncontamination through contact with hands or utensils used in domestic water\nmanagement. Another possibility that has rarely been considered is that bacterial\ngrowth is involved in water quality deterioration (Roberts et al, 2001). This paper\ndocuments the results of a study aimed at identifying the principal mechanisms leading\nto water quality deterioration in rural Honduran communities.\n4Study design\nA conceptual framework was developed, based on observed water management\npractices (Trevett et al, 2004). This included all conceivable water quality deterioration\nfactors (Figure 1). Three of the deterioration factors (airborne, insects, animals) were\nexcluded from this study, as they were beyond the available resources.\nA series of field-based experiments and an observational study were designed to\ninvestigate 5 of these factors (hands, dipping utensils, collection and storage containers,\nand bacterial growth). The objectives of the study are summarised as follows:\n\uf0b7 Learn whether faecal material was commonly present on women\u2019s fingertips,\nand if so, whether it could be readily transferred to water\n\uf0b7 Investigate whether faecal material was routinely present on utensils (dipping\nutensils) used to draw stored drinking-water\n\uf0b7 Determine whether deterioration begins at the collection stage\n\uf0b7 Determine whether the introduction of a ladle to draw drinking-water, would\nlead to lower colony counts in stored water quality\n\uf0b7 Test the hypothesis that bacterial growth might occur in clay containers used for\nstoring drinking-water\n\uf0b7 Quantify the number of thermotolerant coliforms that remain attached to the\ninternal surfaces of clay tinajas after rinsing with clean water\n\uf0b7 Quantify the frequency of hand contact with stored drinking-water, and evaluate\nthe hygienic management of drinking-water in the home\n5Field research was carried out between March and December 2000 in the same three\nrural communities in southern Honduras, in which significant water quality\ndeterioration was reported (Trevett et al, 2004). Study communities were dependent for\ntheir drinking-water needs on one or more community wells equipped with simple hand\npumps. Villagers collect water on a daily basis using a variety of containers including\nplastic and metal buckets, plastic bowls and jerrycans that are typically of between 15\nand 20 litres capacity.\nA complementary laboratory-based study was also planned to provide additional data\nthrough research in a controlled environment. This study was carried out by Janin\n(2000), with guidance and input from the authors of the present paper.\nMethodology\nHouseholds were mostly selected from those already known through previous research.\nNon-random selection was justified on the grounds that water quality deterioration had\nalready been observed in these households. Furthermore, a measure of trust had been\nestablished which was considered important because the research would be intrusive.\nWater samples were processed using membrane filtration and incubated on membrane\nlauryl sulphate broth at 44\u00b0C \u00b1 0.5\u00b0C for 18 \u2013 24 hours in accordance with Department\nof the Environment guidelines (1983). A portable laboratory using membrane filtration\nenabled samples to be processed on site, (Oxfam-DelAgua water testing kit, Robens\nCentre for Public and Environmental Health, University of Surrey, UK), and within 6\nhours of sampling. As a control measure, 100ml volumes of sterilised distilled water\n6were processed to ensure that the equipment was being adequately sanitized between\nsamples.\nAnalysis of variance was used to test the statistical significance of data collected from\ntwo of the experiments. All statistical analysis was carried out using Minitab (Release\n13.1 \u00a92000, Minitab Inc.). The individual experiments and their methodologies are\nsummarised as follows:\nContamination experiments\n1. Fingertip testing\nThe women\u2019s activities immediately prior to fingertip testing were noted. Samples were\nobtained from the fingertips of 32 women from 23 households. Women were asked to\ndip their fingers up to the first joint into sterilised distilled water. Contact time was\nestimated at between two and three seconds. Samples were then analysed using\nmembrane filtration.\n2. Dipping utensil experiment\nA total of 30 utensils (cups, beakers, gourds) made of plastic, glass or natural material\nwere tested from 30 households. The procedure involved wiping a dry, new cotton bud\naround the inside lip of the utensil three times. The tip of the cotton bud was cut off and\ncaught in a sterile steel cup containing 25ml of sterilised distilled water. The distilled\nwater was gently agitated for 30 seconds before membrane filtration.\n3. Collection container experiment\n7This was achieved by testing water quality immediately after the container had been\nfilled, and through careful observation of water collection practices. Samples were\ntaken at random from 26 collection containers including plastic and metal buckets, jerry\ncans, and one plastic c\u00e1ntaro (a traditional container). The procedure involved testing\n10ml samples drawn immediately after the collection container had been filled.\nSamples were processed using membrane filtration.\n4. Ladle experiment\nSix ladles were distributed to households in the community with a borehole supply.\nWomen were asked to serve drinking-water using the ladle and keep it permanently in\nthe storage container. Stored water quality in new ladle-using households was tested on\n4 non-consecutive days.\nBacterial growth experiments\n1. Bacterial growth in stored water\nIf nutrients are present in a biofilm on the internal surfaces of clay containers, it may be\npossible for coliform growth to take place. This hypothesis was tested by analysing\nsamples at regular intervals from a clay tinaja taken out of normal use for the duration\nof the experiment.\nExisting water in the tinaja was replaced with approximately 15 litres of fresh well\nwater. Two samples from the tinaja were immediately tested. Thereafter, two samples\nwere taken every three hours until the water had been stored for a total of 27 hours.\nSamples were processed using membrane filtration as described above. The experiment\n8tested two containers from a community with a hand dug well, and two containers from\nthe community with the borehole.\n2. Thermotolerant coliform attachment in clay water storage containers\nThe experiment was carried out in 4 households in the community with a borehole water\nsupply. The tinaja was emptied and then rinsed with approximately 4 litres of bottled\ndrinking-water. This was to ensure that the analysis would test for thermotolerant\ncoliforms attached to the clay wall as opposed to stored water in the tinaja. A sterilised\naluminium petri lid was used to scrape the internal clay wall or base. The length of the\nscraping was estimated at between 15 and 25 cm, and was repeated 3 to 5 times. It was\nthen rinsed with approximately 100 ml of distilled water, which drained into a sterilised\nsampling cup. However, only 50 ml of the rinsing water was processed to avoid\ncovering the membrane with any sediment resulting from the scraping. After scraping,\nthe scratch marks were clearly visible and it can be estimated that the contact width was\napproximately 0.3 cm. It is therefore possible to roughly estimate the surface area\nscraped in each tinaja, and thus an approximate colony count per container.\nWater use and hygiene observation study\nA female Honduran research assistant was contracted on the grounds that a woman and\nnative Spanish speaker should be able to achieve a greater degree of confidence with the\nwomen householders than a foreign male researcher. A simple questionnaire was used\nas a premise to carry out observation for approximately one hour in each of the 36\nhouseholds included in the study. Nevertheless, the questionnaire provided useful\ninformation on socio-economic status, personal hygiene, water use, sanitation and\nhealth.\n9Results\nContamination\nBoth the fingertip experiment and direct observation indicate the strong possibility that\ndirect contamination via hand contact is involved in water quality deterioration. Table 1\nshows that nearly half (44%) of the women\u2019s fingertips tested for contamination with\nfaecal material were positive. Although the mean level of faecal contamination is\nrelatively low, it is significant that this was achieved with a single brief contact.\nFinger contact with drinking-water happened on more than half (56%) of the observed\nwater-drawing events. Only family members were seen to draw water, though this\nincludes the extended family. A high proportion (47%) of children were observed to\ndraw water for themselves, some as young as 2 years old.\nResults from the dipping utensil experiment demonstrate that these utensils can be\ncontaminated with faecal material (Table 2). In general householders do not assign a\nspecific utensil to draw water (excepting ladles), neither is any distinction made\nbetween utensils for dipping or drinking.\nResults from the collection container experiment clearly suggest that water quality\ndeterioration begins at the moment of collection. Samples from the borehole were, with\none exception, always less than 10 cfu\/100ml. In contrast, water quality in the\ncollection containers varied greatly, and around one fifth of samples exceeded mean\nborehole water quality by two orders of magnitude. Table 3 shows the mean water\nquality at the borehole and in each type of collection container. The difference between\n10\nborehole and overall collection container water quality is not statistically significant\n(probability 0.25). However, the difference between water quality in plastic buckets\nand the borehole is highly significant (probability 0.03). The lack of overall\nsignificance could be explained by uncharacteristic results on the first day\u2019s analysis,\nwhich recorded an unusually poor borehole water quality (37 cfu\/100ml) and zero\nresults for all collection containers. If the first day\u2019s data were to be excluded from the\nanalysis, the difference between borehole and collection container water quality would\nshow statistical significance (probability 0.03).\nIt was observed that collection containers were usually rinsed before filling. In the case\nof buckets a hand was often rubbed around the inside while rinsing. Hand \u2013 water\ncontact was frequently observed as excess water was scooped out, as containers were\nmoved from under the pump, and when they were lifted on to the head. Buckets were\nthe most common type of collection container observed during the experiment (77%),\nfollowed by jerry cans (19%). None of the buckets from which samples were taken had\nlids, while all but one of the jerry cans had lids and these were used.\nThe ladle experiment results (Table 2) were contrary to expectation, and did not lead to\nlower colony counts in stored drinking-water. In fact water quality was found to be\nsignificantly worse after the introduction of the ladle (probability 0.036). It is possible\nthat households were using the ladle for other purposes as well as for drawing drinking-\nwater.\n11\nUsing data collected in the previous study (Trevett et al, 2004) a comparison was made\nof stored water quality by the method used to draw water from the storage container.\nTable 2 presents the results of this analysis and it can be seen that where drinking-water\nis poured it is of significantly better quality than in households where the ladle or\ndipping method is used.\nBacterial growth\nResults from the bacterial growth experiment are presented in Figure 2. There is a\ngeneral pattern of coliform die-off but with occasional increases over the 27-hour\nperiod. These increases might be the result of natural variation between sample\nreplicates, rather than real bacterial growth. Mean water temperature in storage\ncontainers was 28\u00b0C which would be conducive to faecal bacterial growth assuming\nnutrients were available (Davis et al, 1980). The laboratory study recorded similar\ntemporary increases in colony counts. It was also observed that survival times were\nlonger in containers that had developed a biofilm on the internal surfaces (Janin, 2000).\nTable 4 summarises the results from the thermotolerant coliform attachment experiment\nand shows that they were detected in three of the tinajas tested. The experiment\ndemonstrates that a simple rinsing of the container allows small numbers of\nthermotolerant coliforms to remain attached to the internal surfaces. The laboratory\nstudy found somewhat higher numbers (4.4 to 7.3 cfu\/cm2) on the internal surfaces of\nclay containers but not on either plastic or metal containers. Furthermore, total bacteria\ncounts from clay containers (5,000 bacteria\/cm2) were at least an order of magnitude\nhigher than containers made of plastic or metal (Janin, 2000).\n12\nObservation and questionnaire\nThe questionnaire results are presented in Table 5. The majority (94%) of households\n\u2018filter\u2019 their drinking-water with a piece of linen-type cloth. The reason given for this\npractice was to filter out insects or dirt particles. However, it was also stated that only\nrarely was any such contaminant seen when filtering the water. No typical usage\npattern was observed with respect to filter cloths. They were sometimes seen covering\nthe drinking-water container, or hanging from a ceiling hook, or drying outside on the\nroof of the house. It did appear to be the case that these cloths were used exclusively\nfor filtering water and had no other purpose.\nAlthough the majority of households (67%) reported washing the container with water\nalone, it was also stated that a scrubbing brush or more often a piece of plastic sacking\nwas used for cleaning. However, storage containers were not observed being cleaned.\nOnly two households reported that they boiled drinking-water but it was pointed out that\nthis water was exclusively for infants of under one year. Chlorine disinfection was not\npracticed in any of the study households in spite of its availability and promotion by\nvarious agencies. The most common reason given for not using chlorine was the\nunpleasant taste.\nDiscussion\nThe overall picture that emerges from the study is that all the factors considered here\ncould be involved in water quality deterioration. A set of interlinked, hygiene related\npractices and circumstances appear to be the basis for water quality deterioration. This\nstudy has not identified any one mechanism that can be described as the single root\n13\ncause of deterioration. However, there remains a strong argument that hands have the\ngreatest potential to introduce contamination because of the many opportunities where\ncontact with drinking-water can and does occur. Observation confirmed that hand\ncontact occurs during collection, transport and when dipping the stored drinking-water.\nThe fingertip experiment demonstrated that it is possible to introduce gross\ncontamination with the briefest of contacts. It is significant that children draw drinking-\nwater, as they will probably be less likely to avoid hand \u2013 water contact, and their hands\nmay be expected to be more contaminated with faecal material than an adult\u2019s.\nOur study clearly implicates dirty collection containers as a significant cause of\ncontamination. Roberts et al (2001) suggest that buckets used for water collection\nbecome contaminated by hand contact. In their study in Malawi they observed that\nwomen often arrived at the well with their hand inside the bucket, and that before\nfilling, the hand was rubbed around the inside of the bucket with a small quantity of\nwater. Very similar collection practices were observed in Honduras. Furthermore, our\nresults indicate that water quality collected in jerry cans was comparable to that of the\nborehole. This supports the premise that hands are the cause of the contamination\nbecause the narrow opening of the jerry cans does not permit hand entry. Roberts et al\n(2001) found that an \u201cimproved bucket\u201d with an opening preventing hand entry greatly\nreduced faecal contamination of water at the time of collection. Feachem et al (1978)\nsuggest that not washing hands when handling collection containers may lead to\ncontamination.\n14\nThe use of a cloth to filter drinking-water when it is transferred to a storage container\nwas observed to be a common practice in the study communities in Honduras. In\nbetween uses there are clearly opportunities for the cloth to become contaminated from\nhuman, animal or environmental factors.\nOnce the water is in the storage container, there are several factors that may be involved\nin deterioration. There are several references in the literature that suggest that water\nquality deterioration may result from storage containers not being adequately washed\n(Feachem et al, 1978; Lindskog & Lindskog, 1988; Jagals et al, 1997; Ahmed et al,\n1998; Hoque et al, 1999). Our thermotolerant coliform attachment experiment shows\nthat small numbers [of thermotolerant coliforms] can remain attached to the internal\nsurfaces of containers after rinsing. However, in their Bangladesh study, Ahmed et al\n(1998) found that the interior bases of water storage containers were heavily\ncontaminated. Mertens et al (1990) comment in their Sri Lanka study that water stored\nin an earthenware container tended to be more contaminated than in metal or plastic\ncontainers.\nResults of swabs taken from utensils used to draw water from the storage container\nindicate that contamination could take place when contact is made with stored water.\nThe unexpected result of increased colony counts in households new to using a ladle is\ndifficult to explain. However, what is clear is that stored water quality in households\nthat pour their drinking-water is significantly better than in households that use either\nladles or dipping utensils.\n15\nThe results of the bacterial growth experiments in both the field and the laboratory are\ninconclusive. The general pattern is one of progressive die-off but with temporary\nincreases in colony counts during the storage period. Pinfold observed bacterial growth\nin stored water used for dish washing in rural households in Thailand (1990). The\nmechanism of cross-contamination that he describes could transfer nutrients to stored\ndrinking-water and facilitate growth..\nConclusion\nOur research provides evidence to show that hands, dipping utensils, dirty collection\ncontainers, filter cloths, and the sanitary condition of storage containers can all play a\nrole in water quality deterioration. Nevertheless, only hands are involved at every stage\nof domestic water management. Hands can directly contaminate stored drinking-water\nthrough contact, or indirectly through the transfer of faecal material to utensils used in\nhousehold water management. The promotion of greater hygiene awareness\nsurrounding domestic water management should receive more emphasis in community\nwater supply programmes. Jerrycans appear to offer the most secure means of\npreserving water quality during collection. In terms of maintaining water quality during\nits use in the home, pouring water clearly has advantages over any practice which\nrequires a utensil to be dipped into the storage container.\nReferences\nAhmed, S.A., Hoque, B.A. & Mahmud, A.: Water management practices in rural and\nurban homes: a case study on ingestion of polluted water.
