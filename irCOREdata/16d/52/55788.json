Introduction\nAnalysis of the balloon-launched radiosonde data for\nthe Antarctic has revealed that the winter warming\nof the mid-troposphere over Antarctica during the last\n30 years is larger than anywhere else on Earth (Turner\net al., 2006). Data from nine Antarctic stations were\nused in that study to show that a warming had taken\nplace across the 400\u2013600-hPa layer of 0.5\u20130.7 \u25e6C\nper decade over the period 1971\u20132003. The warming\nwas also present in the 40-year European Centre for\nMedium-range Weather Forecasts Re-Analysis (ERA-\n40) (Uppala et al., 2005), into which the radiosonde\nascents, along with satellite sounder data and other\nobservations, had been assimilated. However, the\nwarming was not reproduced in the climate of the 20th\nCentury (Folland et al., 2002) experiments conducted\nwith the present generation of climate models, so the\neffect of the present, and possible future, warming,\nfor example on the precipitation over the continent,\nwill not be represented. It is, therefore, important to\nunderstand why this warming has occurred so that\nthe processes involved can be incorporated into global\nclimate models.\nInspection of the monthly trends in 500-hPa tem-\nperatures from the radiosonde data for the period\n1971\u20132003 indicates that the largest warming has\ntaken place in June. This is particularly the case around\nthe coast of East Antarctica from Syowa (69\u25e600\u2032S,\n39\u25e635\u2032E) to Casey (66\u25e617\u2032S, 110\u25e632\u2032E), where the\nwarming trend has been between 0.5 and 1.0 \u25e6C per\ndecade in June. In the second half of the year, there\nis a progressive decrease in the warming trend with\nall stations around East Antarctica having a cooling\ntrend in December. At the South Pole, there is also\na maximum warming in June. Our analysis therefore\nconcentrates on June.\n2. Polar stratospheric clouds\nOne of the most pronounced features of the Antarctic\nstratosphere is the polar vortex. This is strongest dur-\ning the Antarctic winter and spring when the Equator-\nto-South Pole temperature difference is largest. When\nthe sun sets on the polar stratosphere in early winter,\nthe layer between 8 and 30 km (the lower stratosphere)\ncools radiatively to space, and, by June, tempera-\ntures have dropped low enough for polar stratospheric\nclouds (PSCs) to form despite the low specific humidi-\nties typical of the stratosphere. The stratospheric tem-\nperatures continue to drop until a minimum is reached\nduring August. It is in June, when the temperatures\nare close to those at which PSCs form, when small\nchanges in stratospheric temperatures will have the\nlargest effect on PSC amounts. Later in the season\nCopyright \uf8e9 2009 Royal Meteorological Society and Crown Copyright\nPotential role of polar stratospheric clouds in Antarctic winter tropospheric warming 263\nwhen temperatures in the stratosphere are already low\nand PSCs are ubiquitous, further lowering of the tem-\nperature will only have a small effect on PSC amounts.\nThe average winter temperature of the Antarctic strato-\nsphere has been dropping by about 0.5 \u25e6C per decade\nover the last 30 years (Turner et al., 2006).\nPSC particles are found to exist in both liquid and\nsolid phase depending on the composition and temper-\nature. Below about 195 K, thin clouds of solid nitric\nacid trihydrate (NAT) or liquid supercooled ternary\nsolution (STS, H2SO4\/HNO3\/H2O) droplets form.\nAround 5\u201310 K colder, the air becomes saturated with\nrespect to ice. The presence of NAT facilitates the\neasy nucleation of ice onto NAT particles at typi-\ncal ice saturation ratios of 1.05\u20131.1 (Benson et al.,\n2006). This results in ice clouds forming at tempera-\ntures only just below the frost point. This is in con-\ntrast to tropospheric clouds, which often require much\nlarger saturation ratios with the ice nuclei available at\nthe higher temperature in the troposphere. The lower\nstratospheric temperatures should lead to an increase\nin the number or density of PSCs and in particular the\nice PSCs, which contain more condensate and so have\na stronger radiative effect.\nIn the core of the Antarctic stratospheric vortex,\ntemperatures from meteorological analyses combined\nwith observations of humidity predict that ice PSCs\nshould be ubiquitous from June to September, between\naltitudes of about 10 and 25 km, and may exist in\nMay and October. The prediction is confirmed by lidar\nmeasurements of PSCs (Cacciani et al., 1997). Unfor-\ntunately, there are no measurements of sufficient dura-\ntion to determine a trend. For example, although PSCs\nwere measured by a lidar at McMurdo station from\n1993 to 2001 (Adriani et al., 2004), the first 2 years\nof data were contaminated by volcanic aerosol from\nthe Mount Pinatubo eruption, and the last 7 years are\ntoo short a period and had too few good measurements\n(being ground-based and so screened by lower cloud)\nto determine a trend.\nHowever, assuming that ice PSCs form at the frost\npoint, it is possible to calculate the volume of air\nin which they are likely to be present and how\nthis changes with time, from the temperature and\nwater content of the stratosphere (Figure 1). We have\nused temperatures from the ECMWF reanalysis and\nthe average water content for the winter stratosphere\nobtained from observations (Nedoluha et al., 2000).\nThis is reasonable in June when the water content is\n4\u20135 ppmv, dependent on height, but is less reliable\nin the later months when the water content can be\nvery variable as dehydration by sedimentation of ice\nparticles can cause the water content to drop. It should\nbe noted that the estimated volume and coverage are\ndependent on the estimation of water content and\nso, although the relative shape of the graphs will be\ncorrect, the absolute values may be in error.\nPSCs affect the radiative balance of the atmosphere\nlike any other cloud. In daylight, they reflect shortwave\nradiation (solar radiation) and so act to cool the\n1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005\nyear\n0\n5.0\u22c5107\n1.0\u22c5108\n1.5\u22c5108\n2.0\u22c5108\n2.5\u22c5108\nvo\nlu\nm\ne \n(km\n3)\n(a)\n-90 -80 -70 -60 -50 -40\nLatitude (deg S)\n-0.2\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nPS\nC \nco\nve\nra\nge\n(b)\nFigure 1.

However, over Antarctic in June there is no\nsunlight. The effect of clouds on longwave radiation\n(terrestrial thermal) is to warm the surface and the\natmosphere below the cloud, like any \u2018greenhouse\u2019\nabsorber. Most of the warming occurs in the first\nfew kilometres below the cloud, where most of the\nlongwave radiation from the cloud is absorbed.\nThe determination of the infrared (IR) optical depth\nof Antarctic PSCs presents several problems. Most\nmeasurements are of visible backscatter from air-\nborne lidars, or of visible or near-IR extinctions\nfrom satellite-borne limb-sounding sensors observ-\ning the sun. Many airborne lidars have observed\nPSCs in the Arctic where they are usually NAT or\nSTS types, but there are few airborne observations\nof ice PSCs in the Antarctic. Limb-sounding instru-\nments only provide a lower bound for the optical\ndepth unless it is unusually low (<0.03) (Ho\u00a8pfner\net al., 2006). Hence, the only way to determine\nthe optical depth of thick PSCs is to use models\nthat agree with such IR measurements when opti-\ncal depths are small. We have developed a model\nCopyright \uf8e9 2009 Royal Meteorological Society and Crown Copyright Atmos. Sci. Let. 10: 262\u2013266 (2009)\nDOI: 10.1002\/asl\n264 T. A. Lachlan-Cope et al.\nFigure 2. The mean optical depth spectrum for the last 10 days\nof June 2003 based on the model of Ho\u00a8pfner et al. (2006) using\nECMWF analyses. The spectrum is dominated by absorption\ndue to ice PSCs.\n(Ho\u00a8pfner et al., 2006) to calculate the spectral vari-\nation of vertical optical depth for the equilibrium\nmixture of NAT and ice clouds from ECMWF anal-\nyses. This model gives values for the optical depth,\nin the atmospheric window region around 12 \u00b5m\n(700\u2013900 cm\u22121), that vary between <0.1 at the start\nof June to around 1.0 by the middle of July. Figure 2\nshows a typical calculated spectrum for the last\n10 days of June 2003. For the atmospheric modelling\nwork in this paper we have assumed an average opti-\ncal depth of 0.5, ignoring the fine structure seen in\nFigure 2.\n3. Climate model\nClimate models forced with observed changes in\ngreenhouse gases can be used to investigate changes\nin the 20th Century climate. However, the IPCC\n4th Assessment Report (4AR) (http:\/\/www.ipcc.ch\/\nactivity\/ar.htm) simulations show that the Antarctic\nmid-tropospheric warming is not represented by the\naverage of the 19 models for which mid-tropospheric\ntemperatures are available, and there is no consistency\nin the mid-tropospheric temperature trends between\nmodels. None of the 4AR models have a proper rep-\nresentation of NAT or STS PSCs. The cloud physics\nschemes used in all these climate models are designed\nand tuned to represent tropospheric cloud and if they\nallow stratospheric cloud it is often badly represented.\nIn this study, we conduct a sensitivity study to\ninvestigate whether PSCs can have an effect on the\nmid-tropospheric temperature. The satellite observa-\ntions of PSCs reported above (Ho\u00a8pfner et al., 2006)\nare uncertain; so the modelling study reported here\nis only intended to show that the mid-tropospheric\ntemperature is sensitive to PSCs, and that, with PSC\nconcentrations that are within the range calculated to\nbe possible (Ho\u00a8pfner et al., 2006), a typical climate\nmodel will show mid-tropospheric warming close to\nthat observed. Although the climate model is run for\nthe whole year, we will concentrate on June when\nthe increase in PSCs over the last 30 years is great-\nest and mid-tropospheric warming is largest. Rather\nthan including the full physics and chemistry of PSCs\nwithin a model, we have included a representation of\nthe radiative effect of a PSC, with an idealised distribu-\ntion, in an atmosphere-only version of the Met Office\nHadley Centre General Circulation Model, HadAM3\n(Pope et al., 2000). The model has 19 levels in the\nvertical and a 2.5\u25e6 \u00d7 3.75\u25e6 horizontal grid. It has been\nforced at the lower boundary by imposing same annu-\nally repeating sea surface temperature and sea ice\nconcentration in both the model runs (see below). The\nversion of HadAM3 used in this study has a limited\nrepresentation of the stratosphere. However, we are not\ninterested here in the effect of PSCs on the dynamics\nof the stratosphere, but rather on the radiative effects\non the troposphere. The radiative effect of the strato-\nspheric cloud was included by imposing a cloud of\ngiven optical depth at a single level (100 hPa) in the\nmodel\u2019s radiation code within a circle centred on the\nSouth Pole. The optical depth of this single cloud layer\nis the same as a real cloud that may be spread over sev-\neral layers in the stratosphere. Hence, the PSCs within\nthese model runs are not controlled by the model cloud\nphysics scheme and so they neither change as the tem-\nperature changes nor produce precipitation.\nUncertainties in ECMWF temperatures and our\nunderstanding of PSC formation mean that the cover-\nage of PSCs calculated from ECMWF temperatures is\nuncertain. Here we have defined a simple change in the\narea of an idealised PSC to illustrate model sensitivity\nto changes in PSCs. We believe that the changes we\nhave imposed in this study approximate those that may\nhave taken place over the last 20\u201330 years. However,\nas the imposed PSCs are idealised and our knowl-\nedge of the real PSCs is limited, it is unlikely that\nthe result will exactly match reality. Of course this\nis a simplification as the real clouds will have a more\ncomplex structure, but here we are only trying to show\nthat PSCs can produce the correct magnitude of tropo-\nspheric warming and not reproduce the spatial details.\nWe have not included the effect of ozone loss in\nthis study as in June ozone depletion is small and is\nunlikely to play a major role in the June tropospheric\nwarming.\nWe consider two model runs, both of which had\na PSC imposed during June, July and August in one\nmodel level at 100 hPa with an optical depth of 0.5.\nIn these model runs, CO2 has been kept constant and\neach individual model run does not show any signif-\nicant change in 500-hPa temperature over Antarctica\nfor the period of the run. The first run had the layer\nextending from the pole to 80 \u25e6S to simulate earlier\nconditions. The second had a layer from the pole to\n70 \u25e6S to simulate more recent conditions, with the edge\nof the PSCs closer to coastal stations. These two runs\nare not intended to exactly represent the real conditions\nbefore and after the observed cooling in the strato-\nsphere or the conditions shown in Figure 1. The model\nruns are intended to show the sensitivity of atmosphere\nCopyright \uf8e9 2009 Royal Meteorological Society and Crown Copyright Atmos. Sci.

(b) The warming in June observed between the two runs of HadAM3,\nthe first with a 0.5 optical depth PSC layer at 100 hPa polewards of 80 \u25e6S and the second with a similar layer extending to 70 \u25e6S.\nThe area of significant change at the 95% level (calculated using the student\u2019s t-test) is enclosed within the dashed green contour.\nAssuming the two runs represent conditions in 1980 and 2000, the warming between the runs has been divided by two to give a\ndecadal change.

The models included PSCs\nfor June, July and August although we only consider\nthe June results here as it is in June that there is the\nbiggest change in PSCs and in the mid-troposphere\ntemperature. Both model runs were 30 years\u2019 equilib-\nrium runs. In these runs, greenhouse gas concentra-\ntions, sea surface temperatures, sea ice extent, aerosols\nand stratospheric ozone amounts were kept fixed.\n4. Results\nWhen the radiative effects of a PSC are included\nin the model, the layer that includes the PSC, and\nthose below, warm, while the layer immediately above\ncools. The exact pattern of this tropospheric warm-\ning depends on the shape and depth of the imposed\nPSC and on the circulation of the troposphere, which\nwill distribute the warming. The runs considered here\nshow a tropospheric warming that extends northwards\nfrom the edge of increased stratospheric cloud, par-\nticularly around the coast of East Antarctica, and also\nin an area centred over the Ross Sea (Figure 3b). The\nspatial pattern of the warming in the model is sim-\nilar to that observed in the ECMWF reanalysis with\ntwo maxima separated by about 180\u25e6 longitude and\nequatorward of the cloud change imposed (Figure 3a)\nwith the pattern slightly rotated between the two mod-\nels. The differences between the ECMWF reanalysis\n(Figure 3a) and the HadAM3 runs (Figure 3b) may be\ndue to the different mean climates of the two mod-\nels. The East Antarctic warming is spread over sev-\neral radiosonde stations. Around Syowa (Figure 3c)\nthe modelled warming is smaller than the observed\nwarming, although the shape is similar with a peak at\n500 hPa. The stratospheric cooling in the model does\nnot represent the observed cooling well, but as the\nmodel does not include changes in stratospheric ozone\nor greenhouse gasses and has a limited resolution\nin the stratosphere, this is not surprising. Including\ngreenhouse gasses will increase the cooling above\n200 hPa as well as warming the troposphere; however,\nas Turner et al. (2006) pointed out, this extra warm-\ning is not sufficient to explain the observed warming.\nAlthough the climate model runs reported here repro-\nduce the general pattern of the warming observed in\nERA-40, the exact position and size of the peaks differ.\nHowever, the agreement between the measurements\nand model is qualitatively good.\nSimilar results were obtained with optical depths\nranging from 0.3 to 0.7 (not shown here) and although\nthe pattern of warming observed in the different runs\nCopyright \uf8e9 2009 Royal Meteorological Society and Crown Copyright Atmos. Sci. Let. 10: 262\u2013266 (2009)\nDOI: 10.1002\/asl\n266 T. A. Lachlan-Cope et al.\nshowed a large variability, the warming does not seem\nto be very sensitive to the value of the optical depth.\n5. Conclusions\nThis work reported here shows that changes in PSC\nextent, consistent with the observed changes in strato-\nspheric temperatures, can have a significant effect\non mid-tropospheric temperatures, which, although\nsmaller, is similar to that observed in the radiosonde\nrecord. Unfortunately, measurements of PSCs over\nAntarctica during winter are sparse and those that exist\nare for recent years or have a limited duration and\nso cannot show how amounts of PSCs have changed.\nEspecially the spatial extent of optically thicker ice\nPSC is a crucial parameter for the present study.\nMore information on this subject is desirable and\nwill in future be available from composition analysis\nof multi-annual satellite observations like CALIPSO\n(Pitts et al., 2007) or MIPAS. This study suggests\nthat there are significant challenges to overcome in\nthe modelling and observation of PSCs if changes in\nthe Antarctic troposphere are to be correctly repre-\nsented within climate models. We do not, however,\nsuggest that changes in PSCs will explain the whole\nmid-tropospheric warming rather that they are likely\nto play a significant part in any explanation.\nAcknowledgements\nWilliam Ingram is partly funded by the Met Office\u2019s Integrated\nClimate Programme.\nReferences\nAdriani A, Massoli P, Di Donfrancesco G, Cairo F, Moriconi ML,\nSnels M. 2004.
