Its torsion-free rank equals the\nnumber of conjugacy classes of non-cyclic subgroups of P and it is conjectured that every non-\ntrivial element of its torsion subgroup Dt(P ) has order 2, (or also 4, in case p = 2). The group\nDt(P ) is closely related to the injectivity of the restriction map Res : T (P )\u2192\u220fE T (E) where\nE runs over elementary abelian subgroups of P and T (P ) denotes the group of equivalence\nclasses of endo-trivial modules, which is still unknown for (almost) extra-special groups (p\nodd). As metacyclic p-groups have no (almost) extra-special section, we can verify the above\nconjecture in this case. Finally, we compute the whole Dade group of a metacyclic p-group.\n1 Introduction\nIn the p-modular representation theory of finite groups, the family of endo-permutation modules\nseems to occupy a key position. These modules appear indeed as sources of simple modules for\np-solvable groups (cf. [Pu2]) and also in the local analysis of derived equivalences between blocks\n(cf. [Ri]).\nLet p be a prime, P a finite p-group and k a field of characteristic p (which we can suppose\nto be algebraically closed). All the kP -modules we consider are finitely generated. Recall that an\nendo-permutation kP -moduleM is a kP -module such that the P -algebra EndkM is a permutation\nkP -module (i.e. there exists a P -invariant k-basis). IfM is indecomposable, we say it has vertex P\nif M is not projective relative to any proper subgroup of P . If M is an endo-permutation module\nwith at least one indecomposable summandM0 with vertex P , then this summand is unique, up to\nisomorphism, and, following Dade, we call it the cap of M . This allows us to define an equivalence\nrelation on these modules:\nM \u223c N \u21d0\u21d2M0 \u223c= N0.\n\u2217This work is a part of a doctoral thesis in preparation at the University of Lausanne, under the supervision of\nProf. Jacques The\u00b4venaz\n1\nWe write D(P ) for the set of equivalence classes of such kP -modules. It is an abelian group\nfor the composition given by [M ] + [N ] = [M \u2297 N ]. The unit element is the class of the trivial\nkP -module k and the inverse of [M ] is \u2212[M ] = [M\u2217], where M\u2217 = Homk(M,k) is the dual of M .\nJ. Alperin proved recently that, for any P -set X, the relative syzygy \u21261X(k) of the trivial\nmodule, that is the kernel of the linear map from kX to k which sends each x \u2208 X to 1, is an\nendo-permutation kP -module. Moreover, if X is a transitive P -set, then \u21261X(k) is indecomposable\nwith vertex P (cf. [Al2]). To simplify the notations we write \u2126X for the class of \u21261X(k) in D(P ).\nWhen dealing with endo-permutation modules, we can\u2019t avoid the special family of endo-trivial\nmodules. Recall that these are precisely the kP -modules M such that EndkM \u223c= k \u2295 L, for\na free kP -module L. They all have an indecomposable direct summand with vertex P and are\nobviously endo-permutation modules. So we can consider the same relation as before and look at\nthe corresponding group T (P ), which turns out to be a subgroup of D(P ) (note that the classes\nin T (P ) contain, in general, less elements than the corresponding ones in D(P )). The following\ntheorem is due to Dade. It classifies all endo-permutation modules (up to equivalence) in the\nabelian case and shows that T (P ) is of relevant importance when studying D(P ).\nTheorem 1.1 [Dade, [Da]] Let P be an abelian p-group.\n1. T (P ) is generated by \u2126P . Thus T (P ) is trivial, if |P | \u2264 2, cyclic of order 2, if P is cyclic of\norder \u2265 3, and infinite cyclic otherwise.\n2. D(P ) is isomorphic to the direct sum of the groups T (P\/Q), where Q runs over the set of\nsubgroups of P .\nMore than 20 years after Dade\u2019s result, the question concerning an arbitrary finite p-group P is\nstill open. Only partial results have been obtained in the general case. First, L. Puig proved that\nD(P ) is always finitely generated (cf. [Pu1]). More recently, J. Alperin determined the torsion-free\nrank of T (P ) (cf. [Al2]) and S. Bouc and J. The\u00b4venaz calculated the torsion-free rank of D(P ) (cf.\n[BoTh]). Following [CaTh], the problem of determining the torsion subgroup Dt(P ) comes down\nto finding a detecting family F of groups for which the restriction map Res : T (P )\u2192\u220fE\u2208F T (E)\nis injective. That would then allow us to recover all torsion elements of D(P ) through restriction-\ndeflation maps to all sections of P belonging to F (see Theorem 10.1 in [CaTh]). By now, for an\nodd p, we have to take for F all elementary abelian groups of rank 1 or 2 and also all extraspecial\ngroups of exponent p. However, as it is hoped that we can take for F just the elementary abelian\ngroups of rank 1 or 2, we will discuss here the case of p-metacyclic groups for odd p, where no\nextraspecial group of exponent p appears in the set of all sections of P . The final aim is to prove\nthe following result.\nTheorem 1.2 Let p be an odd prime and P be a metacyclic p-group. Then we have an isomor-\nphism of abelian groups:\n\u03b1P : D(P ) \u2212\u2192\n\u220f\nH\u2208[X\/P ]\nT (H\/\u03a6(H)) \u223c= Zr \u00d7 (Z\/2Z)s,\nwhere \u03a6(H) is the Frattini subgroup of H, for all subgroup H of P , and where [X\/P ] = [S\/P ]\u222a[C\/P ]\nis a set of representatives of conjugacy classes of non trivial subgroups of P , divided into S\/P ,\n2\nthe set of conjugacy classes of non-cyclic subgroups of P , of cardinality r, and C\/P , the set of\nconjugacy classes of non-trivial cyclic subgroups of P , of cardinality s.\nMoreover, the set {\u2126P\/\u03a6(H), H \u2208 [S\/P ]} form a basis of the torsion-free part and the set\n{TeninfPH\/\u03a6(H) \u2126H\/\u03a6(H), H \u2208 [C\/P ]} a basis (over Z\/2Z) of the torsion subgroup Dt(P ) of D(P ).\nNote that it will also prove that the injection of Theorem 4.1 of [BoTh] is, in fact, a bijection.\nLet us finally recall some of the notions we are going to use. A group is called metacyclic if it\nis an extension of a cyclic group by a cyclic group. Let P be a finite p-group. We write Q \u2264 P , if\nQ is a subgroup of P , and we write Q \u2264P R, if Q and R are subgroups of P such that Q \u2264 gR, for\na g \u2208 P , and where gR = gRg\u22121. If Q \u2264 P , we have an obvious restriction map ResPQ, from D(P )\nto D(Q), and we can also consider the tensor induction TenPQ from D(Q) to D(P ). If, moreover,\nQ is normal in P , we have an inflation map InfPP\/Q from D(P\/Q) to D(P ) and a deflation map\nDefPP\/Q from D(P ) to D(P\/Q). This map is obtained as follows. If M is an endo-permutation\nkP -module, then we consider the Brauer construction A[Q] = AQ\/(\n\u2211\nR<QA\nQ\nR) of the P -algebra\nA = EndkM , where AQ = EndkQM is the set of fixed points of A under the action of Q, and\n\u2200R < Q, AQR denotes the image of the relative trace from AR to AQ. As P is a p-group, we\nknow that A[Q] \u223c= EndkN for a unique (up to isomorphism) endo-permutation k[P\/Q]-module\nN . So we define DefPP\/Q([M ]) = [N ] \u2208 D(P\/Q). If R \/ Q < P , we write DefresPQ\/R instead of\nDefQQ\/R \u25e6ResPQ, and TeninfPQ\/R instead of TenPQ \u25e6 InfQQ\/R. We assume the reader to be familiar with\nall the properties of these notions and with basic results of representation theory of finite groups.\n2 Structure of metacyclic p-groups\nLet P be a metacyclic p-group (p odd) such that the sequence 1\u2192 Cpn \u2192 P \u2192 Cpm \u2192 1 is exact.\nSo we can choose u, v \u2208 P such that upn = 1, vpm \u2208 <u> (including m = 0, in case P is cyclic)\nand vu = up\nl+1, for an integer l such that 0 < l \u2264 n (we have l = n if P is abelian) and where\nvu = vuv\u22121. So |P | = pm+n, <u> \/ P and any element of P can be expressed as uavb, with\n0 \u2264 a < pn and 0 \u2264 b < pm. It is easy to verify that <upn\u22121> \u2264 Z(P ). Indeed, this is the only\nsubgroup of <u> of order p. Moreover, since <u> \/ P , one has that <u> \u2229 Z(P ) 6= {1}. If P is\nnot cyclic, we have the following result.\nLemma 2.1 Let P be a non-cyclic metacyclic p-group for an odd prime p. Then P has a unique\nelementary abelian subgroup of rank 2.\nProof . Let E be an elementary abelian subgroup of P of rank 2. Then E \u2229<u> 6= {1}, because\nE\/E \u2229<u> is cyclic (it is isomorphic to the subgroup E<u>\/<u> of the cyclic group P\/<u>).\nThus, E contains up\nn\u22121\n. The image of E in P\/<u> is non-trivial, thus E contains an element of\nthe form uavp\nm\u22121\n, and in fact E = <up\nn\u22121\n, uavp\nm\u22121\n> (since <up\nn\u22121\n> < <up\nn\u22121\n, uavp\nm\u22121\n> \u2264 E).\nSet w = vp\nm\u22121\n. The action of w on <u> is given by wu = ur, where r = spn\u22121 + 1, for some\ninteger s > 0 : if w and u commute, take s = p. This will be the case in particular if n = 1, since\nthis implies that P is abelian.\n3\nMoreover, there is an integer d such that wp = ud, and d is a multiple of p if P is non-cyclic\n(otherwise d is prime to p and there exists an integer e, prime to p, such that de \u2261 1 (mod pn), but\nthen u = ude = wpe \u2208 <v>). Then\n(uaw)p = ua(wu)a(w\n2\nu)a \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (wp\u22121u)awp = ua(r+r2+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7+rp\u22121)+d = ua r\np\u22121\nr\u22121 +d.\nFinally,\nrp \u2212 1\nr \u2212 1 = (sp\nn\u22121)p\u22121 +\n(\np\n1\n)\n(spn\u22121)p\u22122 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+\n(\np\np\u2212 2\n)\nspn\u22121 +\n(\np\np\u2212 1\n)\n.\nSince (spn\u22121)p\u22121 \u2261 0 (mod pn) (even if n = 1, with the above convention on s), and since, for\np odd, the binomial coefficients are all multiple of p, it follows that r\np\u22121\nr\u22121 \u2261 p (mod pn). Hence,\n(uaw)p = uap+d and this is equal to 1 if and only if ap + d is a multiple of pn. Equivalently, a is\ncongruent to \u2212dp modulo pn\u22121, and E = <up\nn\u22121\n, u\u2212\nd\np vp\nm\u22121\n>. Conversely, the previous argument\nshows that the group E defined by this formula is elementary abelian of rank 2. Hence P has an\nelementary abelian subgroup of rank 2, and it is unique.\n\u0003\nWe can deduce immediately from Lemma 2.1 the following consequence, which is fundamental\nfor the motivation of this paper.\nCorollary 2.2 Let P and p be as in the previous lemma. Then P has no extraspecial section of\nexponent p.\nProof . Any non-trivial extraspecial p-group of exponent p has many elementary abelian subgroups\nof rank 2. As any subgroup and any quotient of a metacyclic group is still metacyclic, it follows\nthat any section of P is a metacyclic group and thus it cannot be an extraspecial group of exponent\np.\n\u0003\nRemark 2.3 Note that this lemma doesn\u2019t apply to metacyclic 2-groups, as, for instance, the\ndihedral group of order 8 is metacyclic but has 2 elementary abelian subgroups of rank 2.\nHere is another property of non-cyclic metacyclic p-groups which will be of relevant importance\nfor the proof of Theorem 1.2.\nLemma 2.4 Assume P to be non-cyclic and let H be a non-cyclic subgroup of P . Then H is\nuniquely determined by \u03a6(H). In other words, if H and K are two non-cyclic subgroups of P , with\n\u03a6(K) = \u03a6(H), then K = H.\nProof . Consider N = NP (\u03a6(H)). The quotient group N\/\u03a6(H) is also metacyclic and so has\na unique elementary abelian subgroup of rank 2, by the previous lemma and the fact that it is\nnon-cyclic (since it contains H\/\u03a6(H) \u223c= Cp \u00d7 Cp because H is metacyclic, hence generated by\ntwo elements, and non-cyclic). So N has a unique subgroup containing \u03a6(H) and such that the\nquotient is elementary abelian of rank 2. Thus H is unique.\n4\n\u0003We conclude this section with an immediate consequence of this lemma.\nCorollary 2.5 Under the same hypothesis of Lemma 2.4, we have NP (H) = NP (\u03a6(H)).\nProof . \u03a6(H) is a characteristic subgroup of NP (H). Thus we have NP (H) \u2264 NP (\u03a6(H)).\nConversely, if u \u2208 NP (\u03a6(H)), then \u03a6( uH) = u(\u03a6(H)) = \u03a6(H) implies H = uH by Lemma 2.4.\n\u0003\n3 The Dade group of a metacyclic p-group\nLet P be a metacyclic p-group (p odd) and consider the homomorphism of abelian groups\n\u03a8P =\n\u220f\nQ\u2208[X\/P ]\nDefresPQ\/\u03a6(Q) : D(P ) \u2212\u2192\n\u220f\nQ\u2208[X\/P ]\nD(Q\/\u03a6(Q)),\nwhere [X\/P ] is a set of representatives of the conjugacy classes of the non-trivial subgroups of\nP . We can write X\/P as the disjoint union of S\/P and C\/P , where S\/P is the set of conjugacy\nclasses of non-cyclic subgroups of P , and C\/P is the set of conjugacy classes of non-trivial cyclic\nsubgroups of P .\nProposition 3.1 The map \u03a8P is injective.\nProof . For allQ \u2208 [X\/P ], the quotientQ\/\u03a6(Q) is cyclic of order p, ifQ is cyclic, and elementary\nabelian of rank 2 otherwise. So we have respectively D(Q\/\u03a6(Q)) = T (Q\/\u03a6(Q)) \u223c= Z\/2Z or\nD(Q\/\u03a6(Q)) \u223c= \u2295R<Q T (Q\/R) \u223c= Z \u2295 (Z\/2Z)p+1. As P doesn\u2019t have any extraspecial section of\nexponent p (cf. Lemma 2.2), Theorem 10.1 of [CaTh] implies that the map\u220f\nH\/K\u2208[Y\/P ]\nDefresPH\/K : D(P ) \u2212\u2192\n\u220f\nH\/K\u2208[Y\/P ]\nD(H\/K) is injective,\nwhere Y denotes the set of all elementary abelian sections of P of rank 1 or 2. Let us prove the\nresult by induction on |P |. If |P | = p, then S = \u2205, C = {P} and so \u03a8P = IdD(P ) is injective.\nAssume |P | > p and let a \u2208 Ker(\u03a8P ). We must prove that DefresPH\/K(a) = 0, \u2200H\/K \u2208 Y.\nLet H < P . Then it is clear that ResPH(a) \u2208 Ker(\u03a8H). Thus, by induction hypothesis, we have\nResPH(a) = 0 and so Defres\nP\nH\/K(a) = 0. If H = P and K\/P is such that P\/K is elementary abelian\nof rank 1 or 2, then we must show that DefPP\/K(a) = 0. If P\/K is elementary abelian of rank 2,\nthen K = \u03a6(P ), and DefPP\/K(a) = 0 by assumption. Suppose |P : K| = p. Then \u03a6(P ) < K < P\nand we have DefPP\/K(a) = Def\nP\/\u03a6(P )\nP\/K\n(\nDefPP\/\u03a6(P )(a)\n)\n= DefP\/\u03a6(P )P\/K (0) = 0, by hypothesis on a.\n\u0003\nIn order to prove the injectivity of the map given in Theorem 1.2, we first need two more\nlemmas.\n5\nLemma 3.2 Let P be a non-cyclic metacyclic p-group (p odd). Then, the map\u220f\n1<Q<P\nResPQ : D\nt(P ) \u2212\u2192\n\u220f\n1<Q<P\nDt(Q) is injective.\nProof . Proposition 3.1 implies that\n\u220f\n1<Q\u2264P Defres\nP\nQ\/\u03a6(Q) : D\nt(P ) \u2212\u2192 \u220f1<Q\u2264P Dt(Q\/\u03a6(Q))\nis injective. Moreover,\n\u220f\n\u03a6(Q)<R<QRes\nQ\/\u03a6(Q)\nR\/\u03a6(Q) : D\nt(Q\/\u03a6(Q)) \u2212\u2192 \u220f\u03a6(Q)<R<QDt(R\/\u03a6(Q)) is\ninjective for any non-cyclic subgroup Q of P , by Lemma 6.1 of [BoTh]. So, there is a commutative\nsquare\nDt(P ) \u2212\u2192 \u220f1<S<P Dt(S)\n\u2193 \u2193\u220f\n1<Q\u2264P D\nt(Q\/\u03a6(Q)) \u2212\u2192 \u220f\u03a6(Q)<R<QDt(R\/\u03a6(Q)),\nwhere the upper horizontal map is\n\u220f\n1<S<P Res\nP\nS , the bottom map is\n\u220f\n\u03a6(Q)<R<QRes\nQ\/\u03a6(Q)\nR\/\u03a6(Q), which\nis injective by Lemma 6.1 of [BoTh], and the left vertical map is\n\u220f\n1<Q\u2264P Defres\nP\nQ\/\u03a6(Q), which is\ninjective by the previous proposition. Hence the top map is injective.\n\u0003\nLemma 3.3 Let P be a metacyclic p-group (p odd) and C the set of all non-trivial cyclic subgroups\nof P . Then, the map\n\u220f\n[C\u2208C\/P ]Defres\nP\nC\/\u03a6(C) : D\nt(P ) \u2212\u2192\u220fC\u2208[C\/P ] T (C\/\u03a6(C)) is injective.\nProof . Note that this map is well defined, as C\/\u03a6(C) is cyclic of order p and so D(C\/\u03a6(C)) =\nT (C\/\u03a6(C)) is cyclic of order 2, for all C \u2208 C. Let us proceed by induction on |P | and start with\n|P | = p. Then C = {P} and the above map is the identity map. Assume now |P | > p. If P is\ncyclic, then, the lemma coincides with Proposition 3.1, and so there is nothing to prove. If P is not\ncyclic, then, by induction and the above lemma, it follows that\n\u220f\nC\u2208C Defres\nP\nC\/\u03a6(C) maps D\nt(P )\ninto\n\u220f\nC\u2208C T (C\/\u03a6(C)). As Ker\n(\nDefresPQ\/\u03a6(Q)\n)\n= Ker\n(\nDefresPgQ\/\u03a6( gQ)\n)\n, \u2200Q \u2264 P , we can restrict\nthis map to the conjugacy classes of non-trivial cyclic subgroups without loosing the injectivity\nand so the lemma is proved.\n\u0003\nNotice that this lemma gives us an upper bound for the rank of the torsion subgroup of D(P ).\nWe will show later that this rank is, in fact, equal to this upper bound. Let us turn back now to\nthe injectivity question. The result of Proposition 3.1 can be improved in the following sense. If\nP is an abelian group, we can consider the \u201cprojection\u201d \u03c1P : D(P )\u0010T (P ), defined thanks to the\nisomorphism given in Theorem 1.1, where the reverse isomorphism is equal to\u2295\nQ<P\nInfPP\/Q :\n\u2295\nQ<P\nT (P\/Q) \u2212\u2192 D(P ).\nLet P be a metacyclic p-group (p odd) and let \u03b1P be the homomorphism of abelian groups defined\nas the composition\n(\u220f\nQ\u2208[X\/P ] \u03c1Q\/\u03a6(Q)\n)\n\u25e6\u03a8P .\nTheorem 3.4 The map \u03b1P : D(P ) \u2212\u2192\n\u220f\nQ\u2208[X\/P ] T (Q\/\u03a6(Q)) is injective.\n6\nProof . \u03a8P composed with the isomorphism in Theorem 1.1 gives an injective map\n\u03a8\u2032P : D(P ) \u2212\u2192\n\u220f\nQ\u2208[S\/P ]\n(\u2295\u03a6(Q)\u2264R<QT (R\/\u03a6(Q)))\u00d7 \u220f\nC\u2208[C\/P ]\nT\n(\nC\/\u03a6(C)\n)\n.\nLet x \u2208 Ker(\u03b1P ). Then we have \u03a8\u2032P (x) = (xQ)Q\u2208[X\/P ], with xQ = 0, if Q is cyclic, or xQ \u2208\n\u2295\u03a6(Q)<R<QT (R\/\u03a6(Q)), otherwise. Thus we have 2x \u2208 Ker(\u03a8\u2032P ) = Ker(\u03a8P ) and so x \u2208 Dt(P ),\nsince \u03a8P is injective.\nThe previous Lemma implies that the product of deflation-restriction maps from Dt(P ) to\u220f\nC\u2208[C\/P ] T\n(\nC\/\u03a6(C)\n)\nis injective. But this map coincide with the restriction of \u03b1P to Dt(P ), and,\nby hypothesis, x \u2208 Ker(\u03b1P ). Hence, x = 0. Thus, the map \u03b1P is injective.\n\u0003\nTo prove the surjectivity of \u03b1P , we are going to choose a subset of D(P ) which is mapped onto\na set of generators of the target. In order to do this, we must first define an order on the set [X\/P ]\nof representatives of the conjugacy classes of the non-trivial subgroups of P . Consider separately\nthe representatives [C\/P ] of the conjugacy classes of non-trivial cyclic subgroups and [S\/P ] of the\nnon-cyclic subgroups. Note that S = \u2205 iff P is cyclic, and C 6= \u2205, \u2200P 6= {1}. On both sets, there is\na \u201cnatural\u201d order \u0016, induced by the inclusion (that is H \u0016 K, if H \u2264P K, and H and K are both\nin C, or both in S) and we can extend them to total orders, still denoted by \u0016, on [C\/P ] and on\n[S\/P ]. Let now H and K be in [X\/P ] and write H \u0016 K if exactly one of the following condition\nis satisfied:\n1. H \u2208 [C\/P ] and K \u2208 [S\/P ].\n2. H,K \u2208 [C\/P ] and H \u0016 K.\n3. H,K \u2208 [S\/P ] and H \u0016 K.\nConsider the following set of elements of D(P ) and order it according to the increasing order of\nthe subgroups which appear in the subscripts.\nB =\n{\nTeninfPC\/\u03a6(C) \u2126C\/\u03a6(C), C \u2208 [C\/P ]\n}\u22c3{\n\u2126P\/\u03a6(Q), Q \u2208 [S\/P ]\n}\n.\nLet us prove that B form a basis of the abelian group D(P ), viewed as the direct sum of a\nfree Z-module of rank |[S\/P ]| and a F2-vector space of dimension |[C\/P ]|. Let C \u2208 [C\/P ] and\nconsider TeninfPC\/\u03a6(C) \u2126C\/\u03a6(C). It is a torsion element so the component of its image by \u03b1P in\nany T (Q\/\u03a6(Q)) for Q \u2208 [S\/P ] must be zero as T (Q\/\u03a6(Q)) \u223c= Z. Moreover, in Theorem 6.2 of\n[BoTh], it is proved that DefresPC\u2032\/\u03a6(C\u2032)(Teninf\nP\nC\/\u03a6(C) \u2126C\/\u03a6(C)) = \u03b4C,C\u2032\u2126C\/\u03a6(C), \u2200C,C \u2032 \u2208 [C\/P ].\nLet H \u2208 [S\/P ] (and hence assume that P is not cyclic, i.e. S is not empty) and prove that for\nall K \u2208 [X\/P ] such that H \u0016 K we have DefresPK\/\u03a6(K) \u2126P\/\u03a6(H) = \u03b4H,K\u2126H\/\u03a6(H). By definition\nof the order, the condition H \u0016 K implies K \u2208 [S\/P ]. We have DefresPK\/\u03a6(K)\n(\n\u2126P\/\u03a6(H)\n)\n=\nDefKK\/\u03a6(K)\n(\nResPK\n(\n\u2126P\/\u03a6(H)\n))\n. Let us recall some useful results of [Bo]: if X is a finite P -set, K\nand N two subgroups of P with N \/ P , then DefPP\/N \u2126X = \u2126XN , where X\nN denotes the set of\n7\nfixed point of X under the action of N . We also have ResPK \u2126X = \u2126ResPK X . Then, using Mackey\u2019s\nformula and the isomorphism of P -sets IndPK{\u2217} \u223c= P\/K, it follows that\nResPK(P\/\u03a6(H)) =\n( \u2210\ng\u2208[K\\P\/\u03a6(H)], g\u2208N\nK\/(K \u2229 \u03a6(H))\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\n(I)\n)\u2210( \u2210\ng\u2208[K\\P\/\u03a6(H)], g 6\u2208N\nK\/(K \u2229 g\u03a6(H))\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\n(II)\n)\n,\nwhere N = NP (\u03a6(H)) = NP (H). If H = K, then all the elements of (I) are fixed by \u03a6(H). But\nthere is no fixed point in (II). Indeed, if\nx(H \u2229 g\u03a6(H)) \u2208 (H\/H \u2229 g\u03a6(H))\u03a6(H) = {x(H \u2229 g\u03a6(H)) | yx \u2208 H \u2229 g\u03a6(H), \u2200 y \u2208 \u03a6(H)},\nthen \u03a6(H) = \u03a6(H)x \u2264 H \u2229 g\u03a6(H) \u2264 g\u03a6(H). Thus \u03a6(H) = g\u03a6(H), i.e. g \u2208 N . It follows that\nDefresPH\/\u03a6(H) \u2126P\/\u03a6(H) = \u2126H\/\u03a6(H) \u2208 D(H\/\u03a6(H)), as \u21261H\/\u03a6(H)(k) is a direct summand of the kernel\nof the map\n(\u2295\ng\u2208[N\/H] k[H\/\u03a6(H)]\u2192 k\n)\n(and so is \u201cthe\u201d cap of this kernel). If |H| < |K|, then\nthere is no fixed point at all and so DefresPK\/\u03a6(K) \u2126P\/\u03a6(K) = 0. If |H| = |K|, then H and K\nare two non conjugate non-cyclic subgroups of P having the same order. That implies \u03a6(H) and\n\u03a6(K) have same order, but are not conjugate, by Lemma 2.4. It follows that X\u03a6(K) = \u2205 and so\nDefresPK\/\u03a6(K) \u2126P\/\u03a6(H) = 0. Let us sum up all these calculations: we proved that \u03b1P maps B onto a\nset of generators of the target group and in terms of matrix, taking the set {\u2126H\/\u03a6(H), H \u2208 [X\/P ]}\nas basis for the target and B for the source, we get an upper triangular matrix with ones on the\ndiagonal. So we have proved the following result.\nTheorem 3.5 Let P be a metacyclic p-group (p odd). Then,\n\u03b1P =\n\u220f\nH\u2208[X\/P ]\n(\n\u03c1H\/\u03a6(H) \u25e6DefresPH\/\u03a6(H)\n)\n: D(P ) \u2212\u2192\n\u220f\nH\u2208[X\/P ]\nT (H\/\u03a6(H))\nis an isomorphism of abelian groups.\nMoreover, the set {\u2126P\/\u03a6(H), H \u2208 [S\/P ]} forms a basis of the torsion-free part and the set\n{TeninfPH\/\u03a6(H) \u2126H\/\u03a6(H), H \u2208 [C\/P ]} a basis (over Z\/2Z) of Dt(P ).\nRemark 3.6 Finally some remarks on endo-permutation modules.\n1. If P is a metacyclic p-group (p odd), it is immediate, from Lemma 2.1, that T (P ) = <\u2126P>\nand so it is cyclic of order 2, if P is cyclic, and infinite cyclic, otherwise.\n2. Take the same notations as in Theorem 3.5. The matrix of the map \u03b1P , in the given ordered\nbasis, is upper triangular with 1 on the diagonal. But, in general, it is not the identity\nmatrix. Indeed, consider for instance a non-cyclic metacyclic p-group P of order \u2265 p3 and\nE < P the unique elementary abelian subgroup of P . Then \u03a6(E) = {1} and we have\n\u03b1P (\u2126P\/\u03a6(E)) = \u2126E +\n\u2211\nC\u2208[C\/P ](\u2126C).\n3. Let us finish with a remark about splendid equivalences between blocks. Recall that a kP -\nmodule M has an endo-split permutation resolution XM if there exists a bounded complex\nXM of permutation kP -modules and an isomorphism M \u223c= H0(XM ), such that Hn(XM ) =\n8\n0, \u2200n 6= 0 and the complex Endk(XM ) is split. It follows from Theorem 3.5, using Lemma\n2.3.7 of [Bo] and Lemma 7.3 of [Ri], that if P is a metacyclic p-group (p odd), then every\nendo-permutation kP -module M with a direct summand of vertex P has an endo-split permu-\ntation resolution XM . Thus, Theorem 7.8 of [Ri] can be applied to p-nilpotent groups G with\na metacyclic p-Sylow subgroup P . In other words (assume k to be a splitting field for G), if\nkB is the principal block of kG, M an endo-permutation module belonging to kB and XM\nan endo-split permutation resolution of M , then XM is a splendid tilting complex inducing\na splendid derived equivalence between the derived categories Db(kP ) and Db(kB).\nReferences\n[Al1] J.
