This paper discusses these issues in the context of 25 \nthe EU Water Framework Directive, drawing on data from recent experimental work 26 \nand a new model (INCA-Chalk) that allows the impacts of different land use 27 \nmanagement practices to be explored. Results strongly imply that timelines for water 28 \nquality improvement demanded by the Water Framework directive are not realistic for 29 \nthe Chalk, and give an indication of timescales over which improvements might be 30 \nachieved. However, important unresolved scientific issues remain, and further 31 \nmonitoring and targeted data collection is recommended to reduce prediction 32 \nuncertainties and allow cost effective strategies for mitigation to be designed and 33 \nimplemented. 34 \n 35 \nIntroduction 36 \nNitrate is one of the most problematic and widespread of potential groundwater 37 \ncontaminants. It is (indirectly) toxic to humans, as post-ingestion reduction to nitrite 38 \ncauses a form of oxygen starvation that in extreme cases leads to death (Canter, 39 \n1997). There is also evidence linking nitrate ingestion with increased risk of gastric 40 \ncancer (Sandor et al., 2001). Livestock, crops and industrial processes can be 41 \nseriously affected by excessive levels of nitrate in groundwater (Canter, 1997), while 42 \nelevated nitrate levels in surface water systems have a detrimental impact on river 43 \necology (Hayes and Greene, 1984). Due to these hazards, conservative legislation 44 \nexists regarding allowable nitrate levels in groundwater and water supplies. Satisfying 45 \nthis legislation is becoming increasingly difficult due to the rising upward trend in 46 \nnitrate concentrations observed in both surface waters and groundwater over the last 47 \ndecades. Nitrate levels in Cretaceous Chalk aquifers within southern and eastern 48 \nEngland are of particular concern, as these aquifers provide 20% of all national water 49 \n 2\nsupplies, and up to 60% of the groundwater supply (Downing, 1998). In some 50 \nsystems, concentrations are now hugely above inferred values in pristine conditions; 51 \ntypical baseline nitrate concentrations in UK Chalk groundwaters are thought to be 52 \nbetween 2 and 4 mg l-1, with an absolute maximum of 5 mg l-1 (Buss et al, 2005) but 53 \nconcentrations in excess of 50 mg l-1 (the maximum legal limit) have been recorded in 54 \nChalk groundwaters since the early 1970\u2019s (Foster & Crease, 1974).  55 \nIt is generally accepted that these increases are in main due to intensification of 56 \nagricultural practices (Foster & Crease, 1974, Limbrick, 2003, Wade et al., 2004). 57 \nWhile such a link implies that, with appropriate farm management, a reversal of this 58 \ntrend is possible, there have been increasing concerns regarding the short-to-medium 59 \nterm prognosis of such a reversal in the Chalk. Growing consensus that the Chalk 60 \nunsaturated zone highly retards a variety of chemicals (Foster, 1993; Mathias et al., 61 \n2006, Gooddy et al., 2006, Jackson et al., 2007) suggests that much of the historical 62 \nagricultural loading is still en route to the groundwater within this unsaturated zone. It 63 \nis likely that this retardation is currently masking the extent of the water quality 64 \nproblem, with negative impacts of present-day practices partially buffered by the less 65 \nintensive land management earlier within the 20th century.  66 \n   67 \nThis paper discusses the above issues, and explains why conventional water quality 68 \nmodels fail to represent adequately the important unsaturated zone processes and the 69 \ncomplexity of the groundwater response.  Recent work has extended an established 70 \ncatchment-scale nitrogen model (INCA-N, Wade et al., 2002) to provide an 71 \nappropriate representation of these processes for the Chalk to evaluate nutrient 72 \nmanagement options (INCA-Chalk, Jackson et al., 2007). Land use management 73 \nscenario predictions from this model suggest that the timescales demanded by the 74 \nincoming EU Water Framework Directive are not achievable for many Chalk systems, 75 \nand provide information on what deadlines and management strategies may be 76 \nappropriate. However, considerable prediction uncertainties remain due to sparse data, 77 \nspatial heterogeneity observed in subsurface profiles, and unresolved hypotheses of 78 \nprocess response. An evaluation of available data in two Chalk catchments (the Pang 79 \nand Lambourn, UK) is used to interrogate performance of individual components of 80 \nthe INCA-Chalk model, and suggest where further effort might best be directed to 81 \nimprove understanding and better inform policy.   82 \n 83 \nNitrate legislation in the United Kingdom 84 \nThe main directives controlling nitrogen levels in water bodies and drinking supplies 85 \nin the United Kingdom are the European Union Drinking Water Directive 86 \n(98\/83\/EEC), Groundwater Directive (80\/68\/EEC), and the Nitrates Directive. In the 87 \nUK, the first two apply nationwide, while the Nitrates directive applies only to 88 \ndesignated Nitrate Vulnerable Zones (NVZs). These are integrated through the EU 89 \nWater Framework Directive (WFD) which came into force in December 2000 to 90 \nexpand the scope of water protection to all water bodies: surface water and 91 \ngroundwater; and to achieve \u2018good\u2019 status in all by 2015.  92 \nThe Drinking Water Directive sets guide and maximum admissible concentrations of 93 \n25 and 50 mg NO3 l-1 respectively for public supply water; these correspond with the 94 \n1993 WHO guidelines (DEFRA, 2000). There is already a degree of non-compliance: 95 \n 3\nin 1989, about 1% of the UK population was receiving water with nitrate levels above 96 \nthe maximum legal limit of 50 mg l-1 and over 200 public supply sources exceeded the 97 \nlimit at some time (UK Groundwater Forum, 2004). In other cases, treatment and 98 \ndilution have been used in order to reduce the concentration in abstracted groundwater 99 \nbefore distribution. The economic cost of this is significant (Buss et al, 2005); Dalton 100 \nand Brand-Hardy (2003) estimated an annual cost to the UK water industry of \u00a316.4 101 \nmillion for the period 1992-1997 incurred through treatment alone. Additional 102 \nexpenses are incurred as boreholes with excessive nitrate concentrations are 103 \nabandoned (Knapp, 2005).  104 \nThe current Groundwater Directive was conceived in a context of point source control 105 \nof a limited range of substances only (Skinner, 1999), however the WFD provides for 106 \nthe production of a new directive which will go far beyond this. One major advance 107 \nwill be the introduction of regulatory control on diffuse pollution. More generally 108 \n\u2018good\u2019 groundwater status will require that a balance is maintained between 109 \nabstraction and recharge, the groundwater body does not exhibit effects of saline or 110 \nother intrusions, does not exceed the Community quality standards and would not 111 \nresult in failure to achieve environmental objectives of associated surface water or 112 \nterrestrial ecosystems (UK Groundwater Forum, 2004).  113 \nThe Nitrates Directive (91\/676\/EC) deals explicitly and exclusively with pollution 114 \nresulting from agricultural activities (direct or indirect). It has a dual objective \u2013 the 115 \nreduction of water \u2018pollution caused or induced by nitrates from agricultural sources\u2019, 116 \nand \u2018preventing further such pollution\u2019 (Environmental Resources Management, 117 \n1999). Nitrate polluted waters are identified under the Nitrates Directive as: 118 \n\u2022 Surface freshwaters or groundwaters which contain or could contain, if 119 \npreventative action is not taken, nitrate concentrations greater than 50 mg l-1 120 \n(11.3 NO3-N mg l-1). 121 \n\u2022 Natural freshwater lakes, or other freshwater bodies, estuaries, coastal waters 122 \nand marine waters which are eutrophic or may become so in the near future if 123 \nprotective action is not taken. 124 \nNitrate Vulnerable Zones (NVZs) are identified as all known areas of land draining 125 \ninto nitrate polluted waters (Osborn & Cook, 1997), which are identified through 126 \nmonitoring data. The Nitrate Directive currently states these designations and 127 \nassociated action programmes should be reviewed on a 4 year cycle. Farmers within 128 \nthese zones are required to adhere to an action programme of measures in order to 129 \nreduce the amount of nitrate lost from their land to polluted waters. These action 130 \nprogrammes are mandatory and uncompensated; DEFRA estimates a net cost to the 131 \nagricultural industry of \u00a320 million per year and admits that intensive dairy and 132 \nlivestock farmers in NVZs can be particularly economically disadvantaged. The 133 \noriginal NVZ designations in 1996 covered 8% of England. Since October 2002 55% 134 \nof England is categorised as lying within a NVZ and a review of these designations is 135 \nexpected imminently (mid-2007). In April 2006, the Catchment Sensitive Farming 136 \nInitiative began in forty priority catchments in England. Advisers in these catchments 137 \nprovide dedicated support to farmers, assisting mitigation of diffuse water pollution 138 \nthrough promotion of best practice in the use of fertilisers, manures and pesticides, 139 \n 4\nreduced stocking density, maintained or improved soil structure and reduced soil 140 \nerosion.   141 \nNitrate level predictions in Chalk catchments 142 \nCatchment-scale nitrogen models can be broadly classified into metric, conceptual 143 \nand physics-based models (Wheater et al., 1993). Models in all categories have utility 144 \nfor aspects of nitrogen management (Quinn, 2004; Lacriox et al., 2006); however 145 \ndiscussion here is restricted to consideration of their predictive capacity. Metric 146 \nmodels are essentially statistical relationships between existing input and output data-147 \nsets with rudimentary, if any, physical basis; extrapolation of predictions to conditions 148 \nfor which data has not been collected is generally meaningless and they are not 149 \nconsidered further here. Conceptual models involve specifying a model structure a 150 \npriori, normally on the basis of a system of conceptual stores (which may be spatially 151 \nlumped or semi-distributed); where these are derived through simplification of 152 \nphysical processes they are often referred to as \u201cphysically-based\u201d. Physics-based 153 \nfully distributed models seek to capture a system's response by incorporating 154 \nsignificant processes through fundamental physical equations. The distinction 155 \nbetween physically based semi-distributed conceptual models and fully distributed 156 \nphysics-based models can become blurred depending on the level of simplification 157 \nand abstraction from reality, spatial resolution, and number of non-measurable or 158 \nempirical parameters.  Strong trade offs also exist between the level of complexity 159 \nrepresented and the cost and technical expertise needed for implementation.  160 \n 161 \nPhysics-based distributed nitrogen models at the catchment scale include adaptions of 162 \nMikeShe (Refsgaard et al., 1999), NPSM (Carruba, 2000) and SHETRAN 163 \n(Birkinshaw and Ewen, 2000). Particularly complex site specific models also exist 164 \n(e.g. Wriedt and Rode, 2006). Nitrogen implementations of the well-established 165 \nSWAT model (e.g. Santhi et al., 2001 and Chu et al., 2004) lie somewhat at the 166 \ninterface between physics-based and conceptual. Fully dynamic conceptual models 167 \ninclude SWIM (Krysanova and Becker, 2000), INCA-N (Wade et al., 2002) and 168 \nHBV-N (Andersson and Arheimer, 2003); other established distributed or conceptual 169 \nmodels such as PolFlow (de Wit, 2001), MONERIS (Behrendt et al., 2000), 170 \nTOPCAT-N (Quinn, 2004), and RIVERSTRAHLER (Billen and Garnier, 2000) 171 \ninclude static (time-invariant) and\/or metric based representations of important 172 \nprocesses and have limited applicability for scenario impact assessments (Andersson 173 \net al.,  2005). Although it has been contested that the fully distributed physics-based 174 \nmodels are most suitable for predictions of the effects of land use changes (Abbot et 175 \nal., 1986), appropriate measurable parameters are rarely obtainable, and extensive 176 \ncalibration is generally required (Beven, 2001). Such calibration can lead to a similar 177 \nproblem to that seen with the metric models: extrapolation to situations not covered 178 \nby the calibration period is misleading. Although they have great potential for 179 \nscientific exploration and understanding, the calibration issue and the costs of 180 \nimplementation limit their potential as management tools. As a result, the 181 \ncomputationally and parametrically cheaper dynamic conceptual models are 182 \nincreasingly used for predictive modelling (Wade et al., 2004, Andersson et al., 2005, 183 \nLacroix et al. (2006). These retain the flexibility to represent process response 184 \nexplicitly and to deal with sub-annual time scales (Jackson et al., 2007). 185 \nImplementation is also less resource-intensive. SWAT, SWIM, INCA-N and HBV-N 186 \n 5\nhave been noted specifically as having the level of process description considered 187 \nmost appropriate for general management scenarios (Andersson et al., 2005). 188 \n 189 \nAlthough the appropriateness of using such a level of process description for 190 \npredictive modelling of nitrate levels at catchment scales seems apparent, problems 191 \narise when attempting to use current conceptual models to predict the impact of 192 \nchanges in systems such as the Chalk. This is a particularly complex medium, 193 \ncharacterised by a fine-pored matrix and the presence of (spatially heterogeneous) 194 \nfracture networks. Although fractures are the dominant transport pathway within 195 \nChalk groundwaters, they are only activated within the unsaturated zone under intense 196 \ninfiltration conditions; indeed flux calculations from experimental data suggest most 197 \nrainfall events are almost completely accommodated by the Chalk matrix rather than 198 \ncausing fracture flow due to attenuation of infiltrating water within the topsoil 199 \n(Cooper et al., 1990; Ireson et al., 2006). Water table response is strongly correlated 200 \nto major infiltration episodes, with a lag time of the order of days to weeks over tens 201 \nof metres (Headworth, 1972; Ireson et al., 2006). Conversely, contaminants including 202 \ntritium, nitrate and chlorine migrate slowly downward at rates below 1m per year 203 \n(Smith et al., 1970; Wellings & Bell, 1980; Oakes et al., 1981; Barraclough et al., 204 \n1994). Profiles also generally show strong peak preservation consistent with the 205 \nassumption that matrix flow dominates and dispersion is low (Foster and Smith-206 \nCarington, 1980; Geake and Foster, 1989; Mathias et al., 2005), although there are 207 \nexceptions to this which appear to be correlated to particularly small pore sizes 208 \n(Geake and Foster, 1989).  It is generally assumed that in the deep unsaturated zone 209 \nand unconfined groundwater, nitrate is effectively conservative (Brouyere et al., 2004; 210 \nPrice et al., 1993), although there is some evidence that this is not true under some 211 \ngeochemical conditions (Buss et al., 2005) and further research on this is required. It 212 \nhas historically been difficult to reconcile the rapid response of the water table with 213 \nthe absence of fracture flow and slow contaminant migration rates due to the 214 \nlimitations in hydraulic conductivity and storage within the Chalk under specific 215 \npressure conditions. Headworth (1972) interpreted the recharge mechanism as a 216 \nsystem of displacement, with \u201cnew water\u201d entering the top of the partially saturated 217 \nChalk displacing a similar quantity of \u201cold water\u201d at the bottom. This explanation is 218 \nnow well-supported by both experimental and modelling studies (Brouyere et al., 219 \n2004, Mathias et al., 2006, Brouyere, 2006, Ireson et al., 2006).  220 \n 221 \nThe depths within the Chalk unsaturated zone vary significantly over both space and 222 \ntime, dependant on distance from rivers and streams and on season; but are typically 223 \nof the order of tens of metres. Interfluvial values approaching one hundred metres are 224 \nnot uncommon, see for example the depth distribution of the Lambourn catchment 225 \n(Figure 1). As a result of the slow travel times and the spatial variation in vertical 226 \ndistance of the unsaturated zones, water exiting from the unsaturated zone is of 227 \nvarying age, with a corresponding mixed history of nutrient loading. Adequate 228 \nrepresentation in models of both this distribution of travel times and the contrasting 229 \nslow nutrient\/ fast water table response is necessary for meaningful consideration of 230 \nthe implications of previous loadings on future concentrations, and to allow estimates 231 \nof the time-scales over which future changes in land use change might impact 232 \n(Jackson et al., 2006). Representing such effects in fully distributed physics-based 233 \nmodels, where pressure and gravity drive water transport, is possible (although 234 \ndifficult to calibrate appropriately). However, conceptual models, typically consisting 235 \n 6\nof a limited number of linear stores which act as \u201cbuckets\u201d releasing water, are unable 236 \nto represent both the fast water response and the slow chemical transport in an 237 \nintegrated manner. Accordingly, Jackson et al. (2006) draw on insights from data and 238 \nthe physically based modelling described in Mathias et al. (2006) to present a simple 239 \nmethodology for representing the unsaturated zone, appropriate for large scale 240 \nmodels. To account for the different periods over which responses occur, transport of 241 \nsolute and water is treated separately within the unsaturated zone and combined at the 242 \nwater table. The history of application is accounted for through routing solutes 243 \nthrough a distribution of travel times, obtained through combining digital elevation 244 \nand groundwater maps and scaling the resultant distribution of unsaturated zone 245 \ndepths by the rate of average vertical nitrate movement. The approach is both 246 \nconsistent with current understanding of the dominant processes, and simple to 247 \nimplement within most catchment scale hydrological models. The only significant 248 \nmodifications required are the addition of a single difference equation and storage of 249 \nthe history of soil concentrations accumulated as a simulation progresses (see Jackson 250 \net al., 2006 for a full description of the algorithm). It is also parsimonious; assuming 251 \ndigital elevation data and sufficient information on groundwater levels is available, 252 \nonly one additional parameter (travel time within the unsaturated zone) is required. 253 \nAlthough it might initially seem reasonable to relate this rate of movement to 254 \nhydrologically effective rainfall and rock porosity rather than defining it directly, such 255 \nan approach is not appropriate in the Chalk, due to its fine-pored matrix which drains 256 \nnegligibly under typical field pressure conditions. It is better characterised through 257 \ndata from the isotope and other tracer studies described previously. 258 \n 259 \nA well-established semi-distributed catchment-scale model of nitrogen (INCA-N, 260 \ndescribed in Wade et al., 2002) was extended to include this representation. The 261 \nrevised model (INCA-Chalk) takes account of the retardation caused by the 262 \nunsaturated zone in addition to the biogeochemical transformations and spatially 263 \ndistributed hydrological routing included within the original INCA model. Jackson et 264 \nal. (2007) used this model to examine historical and predict future nitrate 265 \nconcentrations under different land management scenarios using existing and 266 \nprojected data within a predominantly agricultural Chalk catchment in Southern 267 \nEngland (the Lambourn). This and an adjacent catchment (the Pang) have been a 268 \nfocus for extensive multi-disciplinary research within the UK (Neal et al., 2004b; 269 \nWheater and Neal, 2006). Sixteen subcatchments, with six land use types, were 270 \nconsidered. A travel time of 1m year-1 was assumed, and fifty pathways used to 271 \nrepresent the unsaturated zone depth distribution (corresponding exactly to that 272 \npresented in Figure 1); note this implies that, given constant agricultural inputs, over 273 \n80 years are needed to reach anything close to an equilibrium level within 274 \ngroundwater and rivers.   275 \nDespite the relative wealth of available data due to the research focus on this 276 \ncatchment, obtaining reliable historical land use and fertiliser application data was 277 \nproblematic. National land use records and livestock numbers are based on 278 \ninfrequently collected census data; only six sets of data are available over the last 100 279 \nyears and  periods where rapid land use changes occurred are often not covered (e.g. 280 \naround the 1939-1945 war). Spatial resolution is also poor, with public domain data 281 \naveraged over large areas (2km or more) due to privacy laws. Information on fertiliser 282 \napplication rates does not even extend to this level of resolution. In the absence of 283 \ncatchment-specific information, fertiliser application rates for each period and for 284 \neach of the six land uses for all sixteen subcatchments were taken from Johnes et al. 285 \n 7\n(1998), where application rates are differentiated by geo-climatic region. The timing 286 \nof the fertiliser applications was assumed to be the same as those observed in a survey 287 \nof fertiliser practice from the River Ant (Johnes et al., 2003). Under these 288 \nassumptions, the derived current-day annual nitrogen inputs from fertiliser for both 289 \ncereal and other arable land uses were approximately constant for each sub-catchment 290 \nat 175 kg N ha-1 year-1, while subcatchment input rates to \u2018grassland\u2019 varied between 291 \n90 and 170 kg N ha-1 year-1 depending on the ratio of permanent and temporary 292 \ngrassland, and rough grazing (Wade et al., 2006). Inputs from livestock were highly 293 \nvariable between subcatchments, between 60 and 350 kg N ha-1 year-1. Table 1 294 \npresents available census dates, along with associated proportions of the two 295 \ndominant land use classes within the Lambourn (arable and grassland), and 296 \ncatchment-averaged agricultural inputs shown as a proportion of current-day 297 \napplication rates. The majority of the census data is applied from the beginning of the 298 \nyear it is collected until the end of the year previous to the next collection. To account 299 \nfor post-war increase in fertiliser use, the census data from 1931 is used from the start 300 \nof the period of interest, 1920, until the end of 1944. The 1969 census data is then 301 \napplied to 1945-1975, the post-war period. The model was calibrated over the entire 302 \nperiod of available data (1920 to 2003) using the Monte Carlo procedures presented in 303 \nMcintyre et al. (2005) and least squares measures of fit; the resultant parameterisation 304 \nprovides a visually excellent fit to available flow and nitrate concentration data (see 305 \nJackson et al., 2007). To examine the time-scales over which effects from land 306 \nmanagement changes might take place, two fertiliser application scenarios were 307 \nconsidered, the first with current-day practices continuing until 2100, and the second 308 \nwith all agricultural nitrate loading cut from 2003. Further details of the model setup 309 \nand data used are in Jackson et al. (2007); note that projected data utilises 310 \nB2HADCM3; a relatively conservative climate change scenario assuming slow 311 \npopulation growth and technological advances moderating human emissions.  312 \n 313 \nFigure 2 shows groundwater and in-river nitrate concentrations in the Lambourn 314 \nunder the two nutrient loading scenarios; note that the simulation with future loading 315 \ncut to zero, which can be considered a \u201cbetter than best case\u201d scenario, has serious 316 \nimplications for the timescale over which improvements in groundwater quality can 317 \nreasonably be expected, and hence for compliance with the EU Water Framework 318 \nDirective. Reversal in the in-river nitrate concentration trend is not appreciable until 319 \naround 2040, while the groundwater problem is even more severe, with significant 320 \ndecreases not occuring until past 2060. This suggests that historical loading of 321 \ncatchments such as the Lambourn will dominate groundwater quality decades into the 322 \nfuture, and its impacts must be considered in any predictions and corresponding 323 \npolicy decisions. The implications of doing nothing are much worse; if current 324 \nnitrogen loading levels continue a steady increase in both mean in-river and 325 \ngroundwater concentrations can be expected for most of the remainder of the century.  326 \nThe implications of the above results for policy are of great concern, as they suggest 327 \nthat increasing trends in nitrate concentrations in groundwater sources may be 328 \nimpossible to reverse through land management alone in the next few years, and that 329 \nachievement of \u2018good\u2019 chemical status by 2015, as required by the Water Framework 330 \nDirective, may not be feasible. There is minimal flexibility in nitrate legislation where 331 \ndrinking water is concerned; it is probable that reduction of nitrate levels via 332 \ngroundwater treatment will be increasingly necessary. This may require considerable 333 \ninvestment in technology, as current methods for reducing nitrate concentrations are 334 \nexpensive and difficult to implement on large scales (Canter, 1997). In-situ biological 335 \n 8\ndenitrification, induced either through the injection of a carbon source (Tomkins et 336 \nal., 2001) or through constructed wetlands to remove nitrate (Prior and Johnes, 2002), 337 \nis particularly desirable as infrastructure costs are likely to be reduced and the 338 \npotential exists to satisfy ecological as well as drinking supply purposes. For either of 339 \nthese to be effective, some knowledge on appropriate placement within a catchment is 340 \nrequired; implementation of any in-situ system in a position by-passed by the great 341 \nmajority of water would have negligible effect regardless of its efficiency at the site 342 \nitself. 343 \nWhere water is not taken directly for human consumption, more flexibility exists: 344 \nthere is provision for setting less stringent objectives for specific water bodies where 345 \nit would be unfeasibly or disproportionately expensive to achieve \u2018good\u2019 status (due 346 \nto human activity or otherwise), and the 2015 target date can be extended where there 347 \nare reasonable grounds (UK Groundwater Forum, 2004). To establish what targets 348 \nmight be reasonable will however require considerable further work. Although INCA-349 \nChalk has been shown to be capable of good reproduction of observed in-river nitrate 350 \nconcentrations, and some confidence in the overall system analysis appears 351 \nreasonable, considerable prediction uncertainties remain due to sparse data, spatial 352 \nheterogeneity, and unresolved hypotheses of process response. It is possible that 353 \ncomponents of the model where limited or no data have been available for calibration 354 \npossess compensatory errors; indeed Wade et al. (2006) note an equifinality problem 355 \nin the Lambourn catchment, with data insufficient to determine the relative 356 \ncontribution of subsurface or in-river nitrate losses or transformations.  It is therefore 357 \nstrongly recommended that further work to discriminate between differing process 358 \nhypotheses is carried out to improve the predictive capabilities of models such as 359 \nINCA-Chalk. To provide preliminary guidance on this, we now use an evaluation of 360 \nsubsurface data in two Chalk catchments within the United Kingdom (the Pang and 361 \nLambourn) to interrogate individual components of the Chalk system response, and 362 \nsuggest where further effort might best be directed to improve understanding and 363 \nbetter inform policy.  364 \n 365 \nSubsurface data on nitrates in the Chalk  366 \nData from the Pang and Lambourn catchments were obtained and an analysis of solute 367 \nprofile data, land use data, fertiliser application data, groundwater level data and 368 \nclimate data performed. Correlations between features in solute profiles and other data 369 \nsets were investigated with a view to establishing the source of solute peaks and other 370 \ncharacteristics. Recent porewater chemistry profiles collected as part of the LOCAR 371 \nresearch initiative described in Wheater and Peach (2004) and Wheater et al. (2007) 372 \nwere available from a number of boreholes at five sites located within the Pang and 373 \nLambourn catchments (Adams et al., 2003). In addition, a selection of profiles from 374 \nBritish Geological Survey (BGS) borehole monitoring during the late 1980s at an 375 \nadditional seven sites within the Pang\/Lambourn area was acquired. TON (Total 376 \nOxidisable Nitrogen) and NO3-N data were considered in the context of the hydrology 377 \nand geology of the area. Difficulties in obtaining agricultural loading data at the 378 \ncatchment scale have already been noted. Attempts to obtain detailed records from 379 \nspecific sites were only partially successful, although some application records and 380 \nland use information were kindly provided by managers of the land containing the 381 \nLOCAR boreholes, allowing associated solute profiles to be analysed in the context of 382 \nlocalised land use and N applications.  Farms within NVZs are now required to hold 383 \n 9\nfertiliser application data for 5 years, however more generally few farmers have kept 384 \nwritten records of land use or fertiliser applications and tacit knowledge disappears 385 \nwith time and when changes in land ownership occur. Without such data, it is difficult 386 \nto define trends in application inputs, and extremes or localised effects cannot be 387 \nidentified. These effects can be significant: although data from Geake and Foster 388 \n(1989) and predictions from the leaching model SUNDIAL (Goulding et al., 1998), 389 \nsuggest that average annual leaching losses below Chalk are close to half the rate of 390 \nnitrogen fertiliser application, differences in soil management methods (e.g. drainage, 391 \ncultivation systems, rotations, type of fertilizer\/sludge applied) cause significant 392 \ndeviations from this at any specific location (Dowdell and Mian, 1982). Andrews et 393 \nal. (1997) demonstrate a significant link between application methodology and rate of 394 \nnitrate leaching from topsoil to Chalk; data also shows the most substantial peaks 395 \nbeing associated with large sludge applications and ploughing of grass crops. 396 \nAddiscott (1996) also notes the potential contribution of ploughing to large nitrate 397 \npeaks within the Chalk based on cores taken twenty years after the ploughing of  old 398 \npermanent grassland. 399 \nThe porewater TON profiles from each of the five LOCAR sites (presented in Figure 400 \n3) indicate that significant variation can exist in TON concentration with depth, with 401 \nthe largest variations occurring within the unsaturated zone. Large peaks in TON 402 \nconcentration were present at three sites; PL10A, PL13A and PL26 at around 17 m, 403 \n25 m and 10 m respectively. These peaks were all within the unsaturated zone, 404 \naccording to water table locations taken at the time of drilling. Borehole PL11 was 405 \nlocated near the river and hence the profile was, in the main, located within the 406 \nsaturated zone. Low TON concentrations exist throughout this profile, with only 407 \nrelatively small variations. Borehole PL14 is located near the interfluve, and the entire 408 \ncore was within the unsaturated zone at the time of drilling. All profiles exhibited 409 \nlower TON concentrations in the saturated zone. This is in agreement with current 410 \nunderstanding and is presumed to be, in general, due to groundwater mixing, dilution 411 \nand dispersion. If oxygen is limited in this saturated region (this is currently 412 \nunknown), the reduction of NO3-N to N2 via denitrification may also contribute. At 413 \npresent, TON concentrations within the saturated zone in all boreholes are within the 414 \nnitrate level limit set by the Water Framework Directive (11.3 mg l-1 N, which 415 \ncorresponds to 50 mg l-1 of nitrate).  416 \nThe origin of the LOCAR data peaks within the unsaturated zone are unknown, 417 \nhowever examination of soil moisture deficit time series led to speculation that the 418 \npeaks could be related to high recharge events coinciding with nitrate applications. 419 \nLithological information provided an explanation for the low concentrations observed 420 \nwithin PL14. Unlike the other sites, where chalk was predominately present within the 421 \nentire profile, the chalk in PL14 was overlain by 33 metres of Palaeogene deposits. 422 \nThe low concentrations observed in this profile are almost certainly due to a 423 \nsignificant reduction in nitrate leaching into the subsurface due to these relatively 424 \nimpermeable deposits. Considering peaks, the lithological borehole logs for PL26 425 \nshowed \u2018putty\u2019 chalk near the zone of increased concentration, with a band between 426 \n4.5m and 5.5m, and some localised \u2018putty\u2019 chalk around 9.5 m -10.1 m (more 427 \ngenerally Seaford Chalk was present from the surface to a depth of around 67m). It 428 \nmay be possible that the \u2018putty\u2019 chalk retards flow and thus solute accumulates 429 \nlocally. However, no previous association between putty chalk and high 430 \nconcentrations is known, and it seems unlikely that this would cause such a significant 431 \n 10\nincrease as that evident from the TON profile. Unfortunately lithological information 432 \nwas not available for sites PL10A and PL13A and thus a comparison between 433 \ngeological features and TON concentration could not be carried out for these sites. 434 \nData from non-LOCAR sites is also illuminating; showing large spatial variability 435 \nwithin profiles within a few hundred metres of each other and with similar histories of 436 \nfertiliser applications. Figure 4 shows NO3-N profiles obtained from four boreholes to 437 \n21m depth at one site within the Lambourn during the winter of 1988\/1999. The water 438 \ntable depth at this site is between 30 m and 40 m below ground level; hence all 439 \nprofiles are fully within the unsaturated zone. Boreholes BE01A and BE02A are 440 \nlocated in land with a history of permanent pasture for more than 25 years previous to 441 \nsampling, while boreholes BE03A and BE04A are located in land that has been under 442 \npermanent pasture since 1981 and  possessed a kale crop during 1979 and 1980. The 443 \nland use prior to this is unknown. At all four sites, the history of nitrogen fertiliser 444 \napplications is 166 kg ha-1 yr-1 (nitrogen) from 1979-1989. All profiles show 445 \nextremely high NO3-N concentrations at some point, but peak depths between the 446 \nprofiles do not correspond, either with ordnance datum elevation or depth below 447 \nground level. Given the close proximity of the boreholes and their similar land use 448 \nhistories, these differences do not appear to be due to changes in meteorological or 449 \ncropping conditions. The differences may be caused by a variation in soil types or 450 \nvery local scale agricultural effects (e.g. stock preferences for particular locations, 451 \nimpacts of drainage or farm machinery); it is also possible that there is a geological 452 \nexplanation. Variation in peak depths has important implications for predictive 453 \nscenarios. 454 \nA pressing question given the ambiguities present in the above data is to what degree 455 \nmodels like INCA-Chalk can represent nitrate leaching to the unsaturated zone at any 456 \nparticular point in the catchment. Direct comparisons were difficult, due to the very 457 \nsparse fertiliser input data available. Nitrate profiles from INCA-Chalk (derived 458 \nthrough taking the nitrate mass entering the unsaturated zone from the soil and 459 \nassuming a travel time of 1m per year), for both grassland and cereal, are shown in 460 \nFigure 5. However model outputs and experimental data were not comparable, 461 \nperhaps in average magnitude but certainly not in form; the INCA-Chalk profiles had 462 \nclearly defined annual peaks present in most years along with substantial intra-annual 463 \nvariability, although the magnitude of these peaks vary according to atmospheric 464 \nconditions around the time of fertiliser applications. The discrepancy may be in main 465 \ndue to poor nutrient loading data quality but also raises questions as to the adequacy 466 \nof current soil representations for systems such as the Chalk.  INCA-Chalk follows 467 \nthe hydrological representation of INCA-N (Wade et al., 2002), a classic hydrological 468 \nconceptualisation in which contributions from the soil component are partitioned 469 \nbetween the deeper subsurface (percolation) and the river (through-flow) using a 470 \nbaseflow index. Hence concentrations entering the deeper subsurface and exiting to 471 \nthe river are equal at any one time. Data does not necessarily support this assumption. 472 \nSoil concentrations near the surface are very variable due to biogeochemical 473 \ninfluences and temporal variation in surface applications (e.g. fertilisers and 474 \natmospheric deposition), and the effect of this is seen in in-river concentration data. 475 \nHowever most of the variation observed in deeper subsurface data appears to be a 476 \nconsequence of changes over longer time periods; there is little obvious seasonal 477 \nvariation. This may partially be an artefact of the sampling process, which necessarily 478 \nintegrates water taken over tens of centimetres within each discrete measurement; 479 \n 11\nhowever a smoothing effect on concentrations in the deeper part of the soil would be 480 \nconsistent with the advection dispersion processes governing the transport of nitrate in 481 \nsoils. Some form of differentiation between the two output concentrations may be 482 \nrequired to improve subsurface representation. However, experimental data 483 \nexamining variations in nitrogen transport and speciation with depth in Chalk soils 484 \nand associated physically based modelling studies would be required to achieve this 485 \nsatisfactorily.   486 \nAlthough it is evident that the soil exerts a strong control on nitrate levels in the 487 \nChalk, there are also questions regarding a \u201cdeeper\u201d subsurface effect; i.e. that caused 488 \nby variations in water table level within the Chalk aquifer. Analysis of groundwater 489 \nlevel data in the Pang and Lambourn over a thirty year period showed groundwater 490 \nheads to vary significantly within the catchment, with strong seasonal fluctuations but 491 \nalso substantial intra-annual variability. Figure 6 presents three example timeseries. 492 \nGroundwater heads generally increase with distance from the river, as well as distance 493 \nupstream within the catchment. Fluctuations tend to be small close to the river, and 494 \nlarge close to the interfluve, although small fluctuation magnitudes also exist close to 495 \ndry valleys and tributaries, perhaps due to increased permeability, or in some cases, 496 \nimpeding layers. In locations towards the interfluve, fluctuations of over 35m were 497 \nobserved; this is consistent with data from other Chalk catchments where fluctuations 498 \nas great as 40m have been noted (Price et al., 1993). As the effective aquifer is 499 \ngenerally only the upper 50-60 m of saturated chalk due to a decrease in permeability 500 \nwith depth (Price et. al, 1993), this \u201cseasonally unsaturated zone\u201d can be a significant 501 \ncomponent of the total aquifer thickness. It has been shown by examination of the 502 \neffect of fluctuating water table on solute concentrations in mobile fissures and solute 503 \ndistribution in matrix pore-water that the scale of water table fluctuations can be the 504 \ndominant control on solute concentration in mobile groundwater (Fretwell et. al, 505 \n2000). At two of the three cores containing the high peaks, nearby groundwater levels 506 \nwere spatially similar and temporal water table variations (around 8m near PL26 and 507 \n13m near PL13) were superimposed. Both showed some indication that a decrease in 508 \nconcentration is occurring with depth over this range of fluctuation. It is important to 509 \nestablish whether the effects of this fluctuating region on solute transfer have 510 \nsignificant consequences for future timescales of trend reversal or absolute 511 \nmagnitudes of concentrations reached.  512 \nWhile the causes of the distinct peaks in the obtained profiles could not be 513 \nsatisfactorily resolved given data limitations, it is clear that they will result in an 514 \nincrease of nutrient input to groundwater some time in the future. It is unclear how 515 \nlarge an impact this will have on overall groundwater concentration, due to unknown 516 \nspatial variability as well as the possibility of diffusion in the seasonally unsaturated 517 \nzone which may attenuate the effects.  In order to better explore the causes and long 518 \nterm effects of solute profile peaks and other characteristics, a long record of historic 519 \nland use and nitrate applications is desired in addition to climatic data such as 520 \nprecipitation and soil moisture deficit and detailed geological data. 521 \nConclusions 522 \nMore than half of UK groundwater supplies are abstracted from the Chalk aquifers of 523 \neastern and southern England, many of which are becoming nitrate polluted as a 524 \nconsequence of UK agricultural practices. While changes in land use management are 525 \narguably the most effective long term means of controlling this, there are well-526 \n 12\nfounded concerns that the unsaturated zone in lowland Chalk will prevent control of 527 \nnitrogen levels being achieved within the timescales demanded by incoming European 528 \nand UK legislation. Chalk catchments, in the UK and elsewhere in Europe, will 529 \nrequire detailed assessment to confirm whether they will be in breach of the EU Water 530 \nFramework Directive\u2019s target for \u201cgood\u201d status by 2015 and well beyond, and assess 531 \nthe timescales in which \u201cgood\u201d status may be achievable. Until very recently, no 532 \ncatchment-scale models capable of treating the complexities of the Chalk were 533 \navailable; a suitable management tool has only recently been developed.                                                     534 \nAlthough this represents a significant advance in predictive capabilities of nitrates in 535 \nChalk systems, INCA-Chalk or subsequent models require further data support and 536 \nrefinement to better inform strategies to contain nitrate pollution.  Key areas for 537 \nfurther work include improving the spatio-temporal resolution of nutrient loading 538 \ninput data and information on topsoil nitrogen speciation and leaching, as well as the 539 \nrepresentation of diffusion in the seasonally unsaturated zone.  Collection of spatially 540 \nrepresentative porewater and groundwater nitrate concentration samples to allow 541 \nfurther subsurface calibration would also reduce the equifinality problem outlined in 542 \nWade et al. (2006). It is clear that although INCA-Chalk provides an effective tool for 543 \ncatchment-scale simulation, an improved understanding of nitrogen movement 544 \nthrough the soil-unsaturated chalk-groundwater continuum (through targeted studies 545 \nexamining nitrogen transport and transformations within Chalk topsoils, further 546 \nsubsurface data analysis and process modelling) is required before further notable 547 \nprogress in nitrate modelling of Chalk catchments can be achieved.  548 \n 549 \nAcknowledgements 550 \n 551 \nThe authors thank Dan Butterfield from Reading University for data preparation and 552 \ncoding of the INCA-Chalk model, Tabitha Sudworth and the rest of the Data Centre 553 \nteam at CEH Wallingford for providing LOCAR data, and Brian Adams at the British 554 \nGeological Survey (BGS) for providing additional Pang and Lambourn solute profile 555 \ndata.
