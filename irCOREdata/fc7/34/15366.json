The\ndephasing times ( 2) and the fluorescent lifetimes ( 1) of the\nmaterials are determined. The critical bit rate ( crit) for\nultra-high-speed population density control is discussed. The\nfeasibility of using the materials for ultra-high-speed, all-optical\nswitching devices is presented.\nIndex Terms\u2014All-optical switching, coherent control, dephasing\ntime, lifetime, rare earth material.\nCOHERENT optical control in semiconductor quantumwells (QW) for ultra-high-speed, all-optical switching\nhas attracted a great deal of research attention in recent years\n[1], [2]. Nevertheless, real world application of the QW for\nthe ultra-high-speed switching has not yet been possible due\nto the restrictions imposed by the exciton\u2019s long population\nrecovering time ( ) [subnanosecond to nanosecond] and low\nworking temperature (4 K) requirement. Various methods\nhave now been proposed, including use of microcavity [3], or\nuse of semiconductors with reduced quantum dimension [2].\nAlthough limited success has been achieved, it will be of great\nimportance to search for new types of materials suitable for\nultra-high-speed switching operating at room temperature or\nat liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K). The trivalent rare earth\n(RE) ions in a solid is shown to be a suitable material for the\npurpose of optical switching.\nAn important parameter for ultra-high-speed optical\nswitching for coherent control, the critical bit rate, , is\ngiven by [4]\ncrit (1)\nwith the dephasing time of the material, the population\nrecovery time, and the optical pulse width used for coherent\ncontrol. To obtain a significant contrast ratio, is re-\nquired. For example, 0.1. In this case, the switching\noperative speed should be 0.1 .

As\nthe population recovery rate can by definition never exceed the\ndephasing rate, a so-called \u201cstrong\u201d collision system, where col-\nlision can simultaneously destroy the coherence as well as pop-\nulations in the excited state, is most desirable.\nRE ions show sharp intra-4f electronic spectral lines even in\nthe room temperature, as their 4f electrons are very well shielded\nby the outside 5s5p electrons. As a result, individual RE ions\ncan be regarded as single quantum dot, presenting large suit-\nable for coherent control [5]. On the other hand, RE ions gen-\nerally present long lifetimes in metastable states ranging from\nmillisecond to microsecond [6]. Substantial reduction of the\nmetastable states lifetimes is then essential to achieve ultra-\nhigh-speed population density control [4], [5].\nIt is now known that the energy transfer from the excited en-\nergy levels of RE ions to other RE ions or to optical traps can\ndramatically decrease their lifetimes [6], [7], which is gener-\nally called fluorescence quenching (FQ). The FQ of RE ions by\nthe 3d-transition metal ions were investigated by Sakamoto [8]\nand Piguet [9]. The FQ of RE ions was also studied in super-\nconductors by Flores [10]. In those works, no information was\nprovided on the and of the RE ions\u2019 energy levels. Here\nwe will report the results of spectroscopic properties of Nd\nions in RE-iron compounds. We estimate the values of and\nand demonstrate the feasibility of using the materials as a\nhigh-speed, all-optical switching device.\nThe materials KNdFe(CN) 3H O (KNFCN),\nNdFe(CN) 4H O (NFCN) and NdFeO (NFO) are studied in\nthis work with the reflectance spectra and the fluorescence\nspectra with continuous-wave excitation, pulse excitations with\nnanosecond (ns) and picosecond (ps) resolutions, respectively.\nThe fluorescence spectra is studied with a Ti : sapphire\nlaser (Spectra-Physics Co.). The fluorescence lifetime for\nthe metastable state ( ) of Nd ion is measured at the\nemission wavelength 860 nm with an excimer laser pumped\ndye laser (FL2002, Lambda Physik Co.) at 580 nm, which is\nin resonance with , transition of Nd\nion. The temporal resolution of the measurement system with a\nPMT (Hamamatsu R928) and a BOXCAR system is 10 ns. For\nps time-resolved fluorescence spectrum, the experiment setup\nis the same as that described in [11].\nFig. 1 shows the typical reflectance absorption spectrum for\nNFO. The clear transition lines at about 880, 800, and 750 nm\nare correspondent to the , ,\nand , transitions of Nd ions, respectively.\nThe intra-4f transitions multiplets of Nd ions located at wave-\nlength shorter than 560 nm are covered by strong d-d transition\nbands of iron ions.\n1041\u20131135\/00$10.00 \u00a9 2000 IEEE\nDAI et al.: RARE EARTH MATERIALS FOR POPULATION DENSITY CONTROL 1035\nFig. 1. Reflectance absorption spectrum of NFO.\nThe dephasing time of the excited levels of Nd ions can be\nestimated for a homogeneously broadened two-level system by\n[12]\n(2)\nwhere and are the full-width at half maximum (FWHM)\nand the center wavelength of the absorption transition lines, re-\nspectively, is the speed of light in the vacuum. The estimated\nof Nd ions in these materials are shown in Table I. The\naccuracy of this estimation is proved by our recent femtosecond\n(fs) experimental measurement on rare earth ions [13].\nThe fluorescence spectra of Nd ions in these materials are\nshown in Fig. 2. Weak fluorescent emission is observed with\nKNFCN and NFCN, but no fluorescence could be detected for\nNFO with the maximum sensitivity of our experiment system.\nThe lifetimes of Nd ions in NFCN and NFO are too short to\nbe resolved by the ns dye laser and PMT system. However, it is\npossible to estimate the lifetimes through the measurement of\nfluorescence quantum yield, , given by\n(3)\nwhere is the spontaneous emission rate and is the col-\nlision quenching rate [14]. The radiation lifetime is\n(4)\nThus, the yield can also be presented as\n(5)\nUsing KNFCN as a reference, it is possible to estimate the\npopulation lifetime as\n(6)\nwhere represents the samples of interest, NFCN or NFO.\nWith (6), we assume that the absorption cross sections by\neach Nd ion in different host are in the same order of magni-\ntude, which can be estimated from the reflectivity measurement\nand from material structure analyses. As a result, the population\nTABLE I\nDEPHASING TIME, FLUORESCENT LIFETIME\nAND BIT RATE FOR OPTICAL SWITCHING IN KNFCN, NFCN, AND NFO.\n* INDICATES THE LIFETIME ESTIMATED WITH FLUORESCENT QUANTUM\nYIELD EFFICIENCY\nFig. 2. Typical fluorescence spectra of Nd ions in the materials. (a)\nKNFCN. (b) NFCN. (c) NFO. (d) The fluorescence decaying curve of Nd\nion in KNFCN.\nlifetimes of Nd ions for NFCN and NFO can be estimated\nwith (5), as shown in Table I.\nUnder the same experiment conditions, the integrated lumi-\nnescence intensity is 100 : 10 : ( ) for KNFCN, NFCN,\nand NFO. The measured lifetime of Nd ion in KNFCN is 80\nns [shown in Fig. 2(d)]. Table I shows the estimated values of\nand as well as the values of and for each material.\nWe conclude that 2.5\u2013GHz coherent population density control\nis possible for the material NFO at room temperature.\nFor the material working at 77 K, the can be increased to\nup to 4 ps. In this case, the critical bit rate of these materials,\n, can be increased to 100 GHz for NFO, which is also\nshown in Table I.\nThe mechanism of energy transfer in RE solids was discussed\nin earlier work [6]. The FQ is due to the efficient energy transfer\nfrom RE ions to iron ions through the bridge in KNFCN\nand NFCN, in which the d electrons of iron ions are delocalized\nthrough the group even up to the outer electron orbitals\nof Nd ions. The delocalization of electron reduces the actual\ninteraction distance between the Nd ion and Fe ion, and\nthen strengthens the exchange interaction and the dipole-dipole\n1036 IEEE PHOTONICS TECHNOLOGY LETTERS, VOL. 12, NO. 8, AUGUST 2000\ninteraction, which are based on the spatial overlap of the elec-\ntronic wavefunction of Nd ion and Fe ions [15]. As a result,\nthe ultrafast energy transfer occurs efficiently, and the fluores-\ncence of Nd ions is quenched dramatically [15], [16]. The\nmechanism of FQ for Nd ion in NFO is believed to be caused\nby the efficient energy transfer from Nd to Fe through\nO \u2013bridge providing delocalized electronic pair, as the actual\ndistance between Nd and Fe in NFO is smaller than NFCN\nand KNFCN.\nThe interesting results appear for the excitation wavelength\nat 580 nm measured with a ps dye laser and a streak camera.\nIt is shown that the population relaxation time is as short as 44\nps for KNFCN, which is shown to be determined by the relax-\nation time of [Fe(CN) [5]. Using the 0.4 ps dephasing time\nat room temperature, we estimate using (1) that 100\nGHz. For the material working in a liquid nitrogen region, the\ndephasing time can be an order of magnitude larger, giving rise\nto the 1000 GHz. The practical working rate for\npopulation density control can be as high as 100 GHz.\nThe materials described in this work can be prepared either\nas thin films or as optical crystals. Optical switching can be\nimplemented with an experimental configuration similar to that\ndescribed in [2].\nIn conclusion, we demonstrate the dramatic decrease of the\nRE ion lifetimes in synthesized RE-iron compounds, which is\nuseful for population density control using ultra-high-speed op-\ntical pulses.\nREFERENCES\n[1] P.
