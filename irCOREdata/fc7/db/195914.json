Although the pathogenic events that trigger PWMI \nremain controversial, the late precursor cells and immature oligodendrocytes \nthat predominate in developing periventricular white matter are particularly \nsusceptible to isch mia. These cells suffer rapid necrotic death when exposed to \nischemic conditions in cell culture (Fern and Moller 2000), and in isolated optic \nnerve (Wilke S et al. 2004), and are selectively lost following ischemia in vivo \n(Back et al. 2002a; Follett et al. 2000; Lin et al. 2004; Liu et al. 2002); (Ness et \nal. 2001). The sensitivity of late precursor cells (pre-oligodendrocytes) and \nimmature oligodendrocytes to ischemic injury is associated with a limited \ncapacity to resist oxidative stress (Back et al. 1998; Back et al. 2005; Baud et al. \n2004a; Bernardo et al. 2003; Haynes et al. 2003), and with the expression of \nCa2+-permeable non-NMDA type glutamate receptors on the somata (Fern and \nMoller 2000; Follett et al. 2000; Wilke S et al. 2004). Recent findings have \nrevealed that the processes of immature oligodendrocytes also express NMDA-\ntype glutamate receptors that mediate early disintegration of these structures \nunder ischemic conditions (K\u00e1rad\u00f3ttir et al. 2005; Salter and Fern 2005). The \ncentral role of ionotropic glutamate receptors in injury of these cells places the \nmechanism underlying ischemic glutamate release in developing white matter \nnear the top of an important excitotoxic cascade.  \n Activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors on oligodendroglial cells \nduring ischemia requires an elevation in extracellular glutamate that must be \nassociated with net glutamate loss from at least one cellular compartment. The \npotential sources of cellular glutamate available for release during ischemia \nPage 3 of 42\nOregon Health & Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Rd, L335, Portland, OR 97239-3098, 503-494-7483\nJournal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nConfidential: For Review Only\n4\ninclude astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, axons and cells from neighboring \nstructures such as the choroid plexus. Of these sources, ischemic glutamate \nrelease from astrocytes has been well characterized in gray matter where it may \ninvolve reverse uptake, swelling-mediated release, vesicular release or release \nvia hemi-channels (Anderson and Swanson 2000; Bezzi et al. 2004; Ye et al. \n2003). While there is evidence for significant release of astrocyte glutamate in \nisolated white matter during modeled ischemia (Wilke S et al. 2004), it is not \nknown how glutamate levels change in these cells during hypoxia-ischemia in \nvivo. Little is known about the role of oligodendroglial cells in glutamate \nhomeostasis, but there is evidence from cell culture and whole-mount \npreparations for both release and uptake of glutamate during ischemic \nconditions (Fern and Moller 2000; Wilke S et al. 2004).  The fate of axonal \nglutamate during ischemia is also unclear, although the significance of this pool \nhas been emphasized in various reviews (Volpe 2001) and there is recent \nevidence for some loss from axons during ischemia in isolated optic nerve \n(Wilke S et al. 2004).  \n In order to define cellular glutamate depletion under pathophysiological \nconditions in vivo, we have probed the relative levels of intracellular glutamate \nin various cell compartments in postnatal day 7 (P7) rat periventricular white \nmatter, using immuno-EM. By comparing changes before and after perinatal \nhypoxia-ischemia we have determined which compartments are glutamate-\ndepleted by these conditions.  At P7, rat periventricular white matter is rich in \noligodendrocytes (Craig et al. 2003) and sustains degenerative changes related \nto excitotoxic injury (Follett et al. 2000).  Glutamate stores were detected in \nimmature oligodendrocytes, axons and astrocytes under control conditions and \nhypoxia-ischemia triggered a depletion of glutamate that was most pronounced \nin oligodendrocytes and axons.

We employed a modification of the widely \nstudied Rice-Vannucci model of perinatal hypoxia-ischemia where the common \ncarotid artery is p rmanently ligated prior to exposure to hypoxic conditions \n(Vannucci et al. 1999)  Since we found that ligation of the carotid artery can \nresult in suboptimal fixation of the ischemic cerebral hemisphere, the left \ncommon carotid artery was reversibly ligated in Sprague-Dawley rat pups at P7 \noperated under isoflurane anesthesia. Post-natal day 0 was counted as the first \nday of life and a total of four animals were examined. After a 2 h recovery \nperiod from the carotid ligation, pups were placed for 1.5 h or 2.5 h in \ncontainers (submerged in a 37\u00b0C water bath to maintain normothermia) through \nwhich flowed humidified 8% O2\/ 92% N2.  In order to restore flow in the \ncarotid artery, reversible ligation was achieved by arterial occlusion with a \nsilastic ligature that was released under deep anesthesia immediately prior to \nperfusion of the animal with EM fixative for glutamate localization (below).  \nRestoration of flow was verified by visual inspection with a dissecting \nmicroscope and was consistently achieved up to 6 hours after the ligature was \nreleased. \nImmuno-Electron-Microcopy for Glutamate Localization.   \nAt the conclusion of the exposure to hypoxia, animals were deeply \nanesthetized for transcardiac perfusion, 0.05 cc of heparin (10,000 units\/ml; \nElkin-Sinn, Inc., NDC 0641-2470-41) was injected into the left ventricle and \nwas followed by 50 ml of freshly made 3% glutaraldehyde (Electron \nPage 5 of 42\nOregon Health & Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Rd, L335, Portland, OR 97239-3098, 503-494-7483\nJournal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nConfidential: For Review Only\n6\nMicroscopy Sciences, #16320, Glutaraldehyde 50% Solution, EM Grade) in \n0.01 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4.

Since 2.5 h of hypoxia-ischemia \nproduces significant cerebral injury in the P7 rat after a seven day survival \n(Vannucci et al., 1999), we, thus, analyzed the response to a relatively brief \nperiod of hypoxia-ischemia (1.5 h).  Figure 1A confirmed that 1.5 h of hypoxia-\nischemia did not produce overt cerebral injury, whereas 2.5 h of hypoxia-\nischemia generated a spectrum of mild to severe cerebral injury (Fig. 1 B, C) \nsimilar to that which we have previously reported (Back et al., 2002a).  Staining \nfor glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) confirmed that 1.5 h of hypoxia-\nischemia did not stimulate a reactive gial response (Fig. 1 D).  By contrast, 2.5 \nh of hypoxia-ischemia elicited a spectrum of reactive gliosis that coincided with \nthe degree of overt cerebral injury (Fig. 1 E, F). \n \nFig 1 near here \n \nUltrastructural features of O4(+) cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage  \nIn order to define perturbations in glutamate content in early stages of the \noligodendrocyte lineage relative to other classes of cellular elements in \nischemic periventricular white matter, we localized glutamate-like reactivity \n(GLR) in four classes of cellular elements in the cerebral white matter of the P7 \nrat: oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, choroid epithelia and ependymal cells; in \naddition to axonal regions. Axon regions were chosen to largely avoid glial \nprocesses but contained a significant proportion of extracellular space that will \nmake GLR values in these regions an underestimation of true axonal GLR.  \nSince there has been limited analysis of the ultrastructural features of immuno-\nPage 9 of 42\nOregon Health & Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Rd, L335, Portland, OR 97239-3098, 503-494-7483\nJournal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nConfidential: For Review Only\n10\nhistochemically verified early oligodendrocyte cells (LeVine and Goldman \n1988), we first defined the ultrastructural features of these cells by immuno-EM \nwith the O4 monoclonal-antibody (see Materials and Methods), which labels \nboth pre-oligodendrocytes and immature oligodendrocytes.  In P7 rat cerebral \nwhite matter, greater than 90% of the cells labeled by the O4 antibody are \nimmature oligodendrocytes and the remainder are pre-oligodendrocytes (Craig \net al. 2003).   \n \nFig 2 near here \n \nConsistent with the distribution of the O4 antibody by light microscopy, \ncell labeling localized to the plasma membrane of the somata (Fig 2 A-C) and \nprocesses (Fig 2 D, E).  Typically, the nucleus was eccentrically positioned in \nthe cell with a mass of cytoplasm at the opposing pole.  The nucleus of the \nO4(+) cells varied in overall intensity, which was related to the distribution and \nextent of clumping of the electron-dense chromatin.  Three general categories \nof nuclear intensity were distinguished that wer  similar to those previously \ndefined for oligodendrocytes (Mori and Leblond 1970).  The overall intensity of \none population of nuclei was light in appearance and contained very evenly \ndispersed chromatin (Fig 2 A).  The chromatin of a second population of \nmedium-intensity nuclei displayed greater marginalization at the nuclear \nmembrane and more clumping of the chromatin (Fig 2 B).  The third population \nof dark-intensity nuclei contained distinct clumps of chromatin at the margin \nand interior of the nucleus.  A survey of 24 O4(+) cells indicated that the \nmajority was medium-intensity cells (54%), whereas light (29%) and dark \n(17%) oligodendroglia were the minority. \nPage 10 of 42\nOregon Health & Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Rd, L335, Portland, OR 97239-3098, 503-494-7483\nJournal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nConfidential: For Review Only\n11\nThe cytoplasm of all three classes of O4(+) cells contained many \nmitochondria, the endoplasmic reticulum was studded with ribosomes and \nmicrotubules were common, but fibrils and glycogen particles were not \ndetected.  O4-labeling was also localized along segments of adjacent axons (Fig \n2 D, E).  Consistent with the early ensheathment of axons, the axon labeling \nlocalized to a single outer membrane that was closely apposed to the axonal \nmembrane. In some instances, O4-labeled processes were visualized in contact \nwith axons.  No distinct multi-lamellar or compact myelin sheaths were seen.  \n \nLocalization of GLR to early cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage \n We found that tissue preserved for ultrastructural localization of GLR \nwas not compatible with the co-localization of O4-antibody label.  Hence, early \ncells of the oligodendrocyte lineage were identified in tissue processed for GLR \nby criteria defined for O4-labeled cells. We identified a population of early cells \nof the oligodendrocyte lineage that consistently showed intense cytoplasmic \nGLR staining (2.13 \u00b10.25 counts\/Gm2; Fig 3).  Staining was completely absent \nfrom sections when the primary antibody was omitted from the staining \nprotocol (Fig 3 A, B), and when the glutamate antibody was pre-incubated with \n100 GM glutamate (see also Wilke et al 2004). Both light, medium (Fig 3 E), \nand dark (Fig 3 A-F) oligodendroglial cells were found in the periventricular \nwhite matter, with a larger proportion of dark cells observed in these sections \nthan was found in those described above. The similarities between the \noligodendroglial cells and the O4(+) cells included numerous mitochondria, a \nnarrow bore endoplasmic reticulum that was usually studded with ribosomes \nand the characteristic nature of the chromatin distribution in the medium and \ndark cells (compare Figs 2 and 3).

In these GLR studies very little reactivity was observed in the \nextracellular space and gold particles were only occasionally seen on the outer \naspect of cell membranes, indicating that extracellular glutamate levels did not \napproach those found within cell. \n \nFig 3 near here \n \nImmature oligodendroglial cells in post-ischemic periventricular white \nmatter could be reliably identified on the basis of the morphological features \nseen in the healthy cells, and tended to have low levels of GLR (0.93 \u00b10.15; \nP<0.001 vs. control; Fig 4). Dark oligodendroglial cells retained their typical \nclustered chromatin, dark cytoplasm and numerous mitochondria, while the \nnarrow-bore endoplasmic reticulum was often absent (Fig 4 A). Occasionally, \nthe processes of larger dark cells could be traced out to contact-points with \nlarge axons (Fig 4 A). The dark oligodendroglial cells contained numerous \nvacuoles (v) that presumably represent to some xtent endoplasmic reticulum \nthat has swollen beyond recognition. In cells that had formed immature \nprocesses, these structures were particularly affected by vacuoles and in many \ncases appeared to be disintegrating (Fig 4 A). Intermediate (Fig 4 B, C, E) and \nlight (Fig 4 D) oligodendroglial cells showed a similar range of morphological \nchanges to those seen in the dark cells. Necrotic changes and loss of cell \nmembrane integrity was not seen in any of the classes of oligodendroglial cell, \nincluding those with immature morphological features.  The mitochondria \nwithin the oligodendroglial cells in general appeared normal, although damaged \nmitochondria were occasionally observed (Fig 4 C, arrow head). The extent of \nmitochondrial damage was significantly less than that seen in astrocytes (Fig 4 \nPage 12 of 42\nOregon Health & Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Rd, L335, Portland, OR 97239-3098, 503-494-7483\nJournal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nConfidential: For Review Only\n13\nA and Fig 6).  \n \nFig 4 near here \n \nProbably the most striking feature of the post-ischemic oligodendroglial \ncells was the presence of large membrane-delineated profiles within the regions \nsurrounding these cells (\"p\" in Fig 4 A-E). These profiles were always \napproximately round, varied in diameter from ~1 to 5Gm and were either empty \nof electron-dense material or were filled with a grainy debris and sometimes \ncontained smaller membrane-delineated profiles. In several instances in Fig 4 it \nappears that structures with the features of large axons are degenerating into \nforms similar to these profiles and more details of this feature are given when \naxonal changes are addressed below. \n \nLocalization of GLR to axons \nAxons within the white matter layer adjacent to the subventricular zone \nwere generally small in diameter and were closely packed and aligned together \n(Fig 5 A).  In this region, glial cells were scarce and often appeared immature, \nwhile glial processes were virtually absent.  Axons in the white matter adjacent \nto the deep cortex were more randomly aligned with larger axons (2-3 Gm in \ndiameter) interspersed among smaller axons (Fig 5 B).  In this region, glial cells \nwere more developed and oligodendroglial cells extended processes to contact \naxons, but ensheathment and myelination were not apparent.  Long, dark \nmitochondria were common in both large and small axons, which had \ncharacteristic microtubules and neurofilaments. In both of the regions described \nabove, marked GLR was found within the axoplasm of large and small axons  \nand mean GLR in axonal regions was 1.84 \u00b10.20 counts\/Gm2. Axoplasmic GLR \nin post-ischemic white matter was greatly reduced in both the shallow and deep \nPage 13 of 42\nOregon Health & Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Rd, L335, Portland, OR 97239-3098, 503-494-7483\nJournal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nConfidential: For Review Only\n14\nwhite matter regions (Fig 5 C-E), and GLR in axonal regions fell to 0.72 \u00b10.20 \ncounts\/Gm2 (P<0.001).  \nWhile apparent axons surrounding oligodendrocytes had frequently \ndegenerated into swollen and empty membrane profiles (Fig 4), axons that were \nnot in close proximity to oligodendrocytes were largely intact following H-I. In \nthese regions some axon damage was apparent in the form of occasional \nswollen axons containing lacunae that were membrane bound with one or more \nmembrane profiles present, in particular within larger axons (Fig 5 C-D).  In \nregions where axons run in close apposition and that did not contain glial \nsomata, the proportion of axons with evident pathological changes such as loss \nof microtubules, axolemma distortion or mitochondrial swelling increased from \n1.9 \u00b1 .08 % (n=19) in control white matter to 7.7 \u00b1 1.9 % (n=10) in H-I white \nmatter (P<0.001). These changes did not generally include frank loss of \naxolemma integrity, even in the apparently grossly swollen axons neighboring \noligodendroglia (Figs 4 and 5). Potential sources of the membrane profiles \nwithin axonal lacunae include mitochondria. Indeed, axons caught in \nlongitudinal-section sometimes had vacuolated mitochondria (Fig 5 E), \nalthough normal mitochondrial profiles were also seen within evolving lacunae \n(Fig 5 C, arrowhead). Alternatively these profiles might be derived from \nendoplasmic reticulum, since small vacuoles of apparent distended endoplasmic \nreticulum were sometimes seen (Fig 5 E, arrows). Despite the presence of these \naxon vacuoles, the majority of axons retained a normal appearance with the \nusual compliment of microtubules.  \n \nFig 5 hear here \n \nLocalization of GLR to Astroglia \nPage 14 of 42\nOregon Health & Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Rd, L335, Portland, OR 97239-3098, 503-494-7483\nJournal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nConfidential: For Review Only\n15\n Astrocytes could be clearly identified in the deeper periventricular white \nmatter (Fig 6). Features of these cells included an electron-lucent cytoplasm \ncontaining glial filaments and many small particles previously described as \nglycogen beta particles, dark bodies in the cytoplasm, a characteristic wide-bore \nendoplasmic reticulum that was sometimes studded with ribosomes, and a large \nnucleus of dispersed hetero-chromatin with no nucleolus (Mori and Leblond \n1969; Vaughn 1969).

As can be seen in Figure 6, GLR levels in astrocytes in non-ischemic white \nmatter were generally lower than in oligodendroglial cells or axons (0.7 \u00b10.07 \ncounts\/Gm2).  \n \nFigure 6 near here \n \nIn periventricular white matter subject to hypoxia-ischemia, astrocytes \nretained an electron-lucent cytoplasm and the presence of glial filaments, \nallowing the cells to be reliably identified (Fig 6). Wide bore endoplasmic \nreticulum was also common, although the cisternae were often severely \ndistended (Fig 6 B'), as previously reported for astrocytes in post-ischemic \nimmature white matter (Thomas et al. 2004). Glycogen particles were either \ngreatly depleted in the cytoplasm (Fig 6 C', D') or absent (Fig 6 A', B'). \nMitochondria were swollen and showed disruption of the internal architecture. \nSome astrocytes that had lost cell membrane integrity were present (Fig 6 A', \nB'), and in general astrocytes showed more ischemic damage than was apparent \nin oligodendroglial cells (Fig 4). As can be seen in Figure 6 A'-D', the GLR \nlevel in the post-ischemic astrocytes was low (mean 0.57 \u00b10.15 counts\/Gm2). \n \nPage 15 of 42\nOregon Health & Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Rd, L335, Portland, OR 97239-3098, 503-494-7483\nJournal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nConfidential: For Review Only\n16\nLocalization of GLR to ependymal and choroid epithelial cells \nGLR labeling was present in both choroid epithelial and ependymal cells \n(Figure 7 A, B).  In non-ischemic brain, the choroid epithelial cells extended a \ndense layer of microvilli, which intermingled with cilia and sparse microvilli \nprojecting from ependymal cells (see (Gabrion et al. 1998). The ependymal \ncells formed a single cell layer covering the small diameter axons that course in \nparallel next to the ventricular surface, or they formed a multi-cell layer (not \nshown).

Early cells of the human oligodendroglial lineage are a primary \ntarget of injury in PWMI (Back et al. 2005; Haynes et al. 2003).  Major features \nof the early degeneration of these cells have been replicated in perinatal rodent \nmodels of acute hypoxia-ischemia (Back et al. 2002a; Follett et al. 2000; Lin et \nal. 2004; Liu et al. 2002; Ness et al. 2004; Ness and Wood 2002).  The evidence \nlinking glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity to degeneration of early cells of the \noligodendrocyte lineage is strong, and we have now defined the potential \ncellular pools of glutamate that are available for release in perinatal rat \nperiventricular white matter, and have assayed how these sources of glutamate \nare affected by a relatively brief period of hypoxia-ischemia.   \nGlutamate was depleted from oligodendroglial cells, astrocytes and axons \nin periventricular white matter at the termination of a 90 min period of hypoxia-\nischemia.  This relatively short insult was suffici nt to produce some glial and \naxonal pathology, but did not result in the widespread degeneration of early \ncells of the oligodendrocyte lineage that is observed following longer periods of \nhypoxia-ischemia and in human PWMI. The glutamate changes we observed in \nthis study therefore reflect relatively early events that are likely to have \nsignificance for cellular injury. Mechanisms of glutamate release from axons \n(Kriegler and Chiu 1993), and astrocytes (Anderson and Swanson 2000; Bezzi \net al. 2004; Ye et al. 2003), include reversal of Na-dependent uptake in both \ncases. Oligodendroglia express Na-dependent glutamate transporters and a Xc-\ntransporter which are both potentials sources of glutamate release during \nhypoxia-ischemia (Deng et al. 2003; Domercq et al. 1999; Fern and Moller \nPage 18 of 42\nOregon Health & Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Rd, L335, Portland, OR 97239-3098, 503-494-7483\nJournal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nConfidential: For Review Only\n19\n2000; Oka et al. 1993).  Unexpectedly, a significant depletion of glutamate \noccurred in the immature oligodendroglial cells, suggesting that PWMI may be \nrelated to an enhanced early release of glutamate in these particularly \noligodendroglial-rich regions. \nWe have recently shown that 40 min of oxygen-glucose deprivation in \nthe isolated P10 rat optic nerve is associated with an accumulation rather than a \ndepletion of glutamate in oligodendroglial cells (Wilke S et al. 2004), the \ndiametrical opposite to that found in P7 cortical white matter subject to 90 min \nof hypoxia-ischemia in the current study.  The oligodendroglial population of \nP7 periventricular white matter is less mature than that of the P10 optic nerve, \nwhich initiates myelination at ~P6 (Hildebrand and Waxman 1984). Indeed, the \ncells studied using immuno-EM by Wilke et al., (2004) were identified as \noligodendrocytes partly on the basis of having compact myelin profiles within \ntheir processes, a phenomenon not seen in the P7 cortical oligodendrocytes \nstudied here. Since different developmental stages of the oligodendroglial \nlineage exhibit rather different sensitivities to ischemic-type injury (Fern and \nMoller 2000; Follett et al. 2000), this developmental factor may explain the \ndifference in glutamate handling in the two populations of oligodendroglial \ncells. This would be consistent with the findings of Fern and Moller (2000) who \nfound evidence for significant glutamate release during 40 min of oxygen-\nglucose deprivation in cultured O4(+) oligodendroglial cells, which correspond \ndevelopmentally to those examined in the current study.  This indicates that \ndevelopmental factors that affect glutamate handling in cells of the \noligodendrocyte lineage may be of key importance to the pathogenesis of \nPWMI. \nPage 19 of 42\nOregon Health & Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Rd, L335, Portland, OR 97239-3098, 503-494-7483\nJournal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nConfidential: For Review Only\n20\n \nUltrastructural Identification of Perinatal Oligodendrocytes \nAlthough the ultrastructural features of mature myelinating \noligodendrocytes have been extensively studied, definition of the features of \nearlier stages in the oligodendrocyte lineage has been limited due to the \ntechnical limitations of preserving perinatal brain for immuno-EM studies.  To \noptimize the i entification of O4(+) cells, we focused on white matter \ndevelopment at P7, when rat pups are sufficiently large to optimize preservation \nof cerebral ultrastructure.  At P7, the white matter is populated mostly by \nimmature oligodendrocytes that label with both the O4 and O1 antibodies \n(Craig et al. 2003).  The enzyme CNPase is also specifically expressed on \nimmature oligodendrocytes, and immuno-EM localization of rat CNPase at P6 \nidentified a population of oligodendrocytes that was similar to that defined with \nthe O4 antibody (Braun et al. 1988).  Taken together, these findings indicate \nthat immature oligodendrocytes can be reliably distinguished from other glia in \npremyelinating white matter.  \nWe distinguished three types of O4(+) cells in P7 rat corpus callosum \nbased upon the density and distribution of nuclear chromatin.  Our findings are \nconsistent with those from adolescent rats (60-80g) in which three types of \noligodendrocytes, light, medium and dark, were defined in corpus callosum \naccording to their nuclear density (Mori and Leblond 1970).  The \noligodendrocyte lineage stages corresponding to these three types of \noligodendrocytes were not defined, but may be retrospectively predicted on the \nbasis of their tritiated thymidine studies.  Light oligodendrocytes were markedly \nmore proliferative than medium oligodendrocytes and dark oligodendrocytes \nwere post-mitotic.  Since medium density cells were the most common in our \npreparation, these are likely to be a mixed population of pre-myelinating and \nPage 20 of 42\nOregon Health & Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Rd, L335, Portland, OR 97239-3098, 503-494-7483\nJournal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nConfidential: For Review Only\n21\nearly myelinating immature oligodendrocytes that predominate in the corpus \ncallosum at P7 (Craig et al. 2003). Interestingly, we also infrequently detected \nlight oligodendrocytes, consistent with the notion that they are mitotically \nactive pre-oligodendrocytes, which are present at low density at P7 (Craig et al. \n2003).  To confirm that the light oligodendrocytes are pre-oligodendrocytes, \nfuture immuno-EM studies are needed to determine whether they immuno-label \nwith the O4, but not the O1 antibody. \n \nDifferential Susceptibility of Perinatal Neural Cells to hypoxia-ischemia \nPerinatal rat astrocytes are susceptible to even brief exposure to oxygen-\nglucose deprivation, as previously observed (Fern 1998; Thomas et al. 2004).  \nInterestingly, degenerating human astrocytes were not commonly seen in \nassociation with degenerating oligodendroglial cells in preterm human white \nmatter lesions (Back et al. 2005).  This suggests either that astroglial \ndegeneration is less pronounced in human white matter, or that it is an early \nevent that does not persist in later stages of ischemic injury.  Indeed, the \ndelayed reactive astrocytosis that follows CNS injury is likely to hide any early \nastrocyte injury (Fern 2001), and early damage of astrocytes was found in the \ncurrent study. In contrast to astrocytes, early cells of the oligodendroglial \nlineage typically displayed limited changes that included cytoplasmic \nvacuolization apparently of endoplasmic reticulum origin and occasionally \nmitochondrial swelling.  \nAxonal injury was focused in the regions adjacent to immature \noligodendroglial cells, zones that will presumably accumulate the glutamate \nreleased from the oligodendroglial cell during hypoxia-ischemia. The \nmechanisms of axonal injury in immature white matter are not understood, but a \nrole for glutamate receptor activation in injury has been shown in mature \nPage 21 of 42\nOregon Health & Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Rd, L335, Portland, OR 97239-3098, 503-494-7483\nJournal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nConfidential: For Review Only\n22\ncentral axons (e.g., (Tekkok and Goldberg 2001). We have recently \ndemonstrated that the processes of immature oligodendrocytes are damaged \nduring ischemic conditions following activation of NMDA-type glutamate \nreceptors that are clustered along processes (Salter and Fern 2005). The P7 \ncortical white matter oligodendroglia examined in the current study are at a less \nmature stage than the P10 mouse optic nerve cells studied by Salter and Fern \n(2005), and in general did not have extensive processes. However, \nvacuolization and partial degeneration of processes was observed, and may be \nassociated with the release of factors such as reactive oxygen species. Such \ndamaging elements may also be released by the oligodendroglial somata, and a \nmechanism of this type has been suggested to mediate axonal injury in central \nwhite matter in the adult (Tekkok and Goldberg 2001). \nAxon damage was most commonly seen in the larger diameter axons.  \nAxons undergo a rapid increase in diameter just prior to the onset of \nmyelination (Hildebrand and Waxman 1984), and these larger axons will be \nmore advanced in forming a relationship with the myelinating processes of \noligodendrocytes. Indeed in the P7 rat we have identified apparent pre-myelin \nsheaths that appear prior to the immunohistochemical detection of myelin basic \nprotein (Craig et al. 2003).  The immature nature of these glial-axonal units is \nshown by the presence of O4-labeled partial segments of single membranous \nsheaths that were closely apposed to the axonal outer membrane.  We have \npreviously identified a developmental window in early human myelinogenesis \nwhen the periventricular white matter also contains mostly immature \noligodendrocytes and pre-myelin sheaths that preceded the generation of mature \nmyelin (Back et al. 2002b).   \n \nClinico-pathological Correlations \nPage 22 of 42\nOregon Health & Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Rd, L335, Portland, OR 97239-3098, 503-494-7483\nJournal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nConfidential: For Review Only\n23\n Emerging evidence indicates that the timing of glutamate receptor \nexpression during human and rat white matter development coincides with the \nwindow of cerebral white matter vulnerability.  Until recently, evidence \nsuggested that non-NMDA ionotropic glutamate receptors were central to \nischemic injury of cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage. Increased expression of \nthe GluR4 subunit on O4(+) cells occurs between 23-32 weeks gestation in \nhuman parietal white matter and P7 rat corpus callosum (Follett et al. 2004).  \nGluR4 is expressed on pre-oligodendrocytes and immature oligodendrocytes, \nand O4(+) cells also express calcium permeable AMPA receptors (Fern and \nMoller 2000; Follett et al. 2004; Ong et al. 1996; Sanchez-Gomez and Matute \n1999).  Hence, functional glutamate receptors localize to oligodendrocyte \nlineage cells during a developmental window that coincides with the propensity \nfor glutamate release from immature oligodendrocytes during acute hypoxia-\nischemia.  Recent studies have shown the focal expression of NMDA receptors \non immature oligodendrocyte processes. These receptors mediate the rapid, \nCa2+-dependent, disintegration of the oligodendrocyte processes under ischemic \nconditions (Salter and Fern 2005; K\u00e1rad\u00f3ttir et al 2005). Taken together, these \nfindings suggest a mechanism whereby glutamate release from cells of the \noligodendrocyte lineage and axons in response to hypoxia-ischemia can activate \nreceptors on adjacent oligodendrocytes, leading to injury. The observation that \nastrocytes show only a small loss of glutamate during hypoxia-ischemia may \nindicate that these cells are neither a significant source nor sink for glutamate in \ndeveloping white matter. Caution is required however when correlating changes \nin cell glutamate levels with changes in glutamate uptake, in particular in \nastrocytes which are believed to retain to some degree an ability to convert \nglutamate to glutamine during ischemic conditions (Pascual et al. 1998).  \nPage 23 of 42\nOregon Health & Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Rd, L335, Portland, OR 97239-3098, 503-494-7483\nJournal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nConfidential: For Review Only\n24\n There is currently little information regarding the potential mechanisms \nof glutamate re-uptake following release into ischemic perinatal cerebral white \nmatter.  The Xc- transporter exchanges glutamate for cystine across the plasma \nmembrane (Sato et al. 1999; Sato et al. 2002), and in the presence of high \nextracellular glutamate this antiporter mediates the intracellular depletion of \nglutathione in both pre-oligodendrocytes and mature oligodendrocytes in vitro \n(Back et al. 1998; Oka et al. 1993). The relative resistance of mature \noligodendrocytes to this form of oxidative stress and to hypoxia-ischemia, in \ngeneral, suggests that other mechanisms may compensate for the downstream \nsequelae of extracellular glutamate release.  These include the maturation of \nanti-oxidant enzyme systems (Baud et al. 2004a; Baud et al. 2004b; Folkerth et \nal. 2004) and potentially glutamate re-uptake mechanisms.  The pronounced \ndepletion of glutamate that we observed in oligodendroglial cells and astrocytes \nsuggests that re-uptake mechanisms may be immature in the perinatal brain or \ndysfunctional during perinatal hypoxia-ischemia. Indeed, glutamate transport \ninhibition in the adult optic nerve in vivo resulted in excitotoxic degeneration of \nboth oligodendrocytes and axons mediated by AMPA and kainate receptor \nover-activation (Domercq et al. 2005). \n The timing of hypoxia-ischemia during development appears to \ndetermine the extent of white matter damage and the cell types that degenerate.  \nThe cerebral white matter of normal term infants is generally more resistant to \ninjury than that of preterm infants (Volpe 2001).
