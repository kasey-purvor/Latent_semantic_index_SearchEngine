Introduction \n \nThe insect vector borne protozoan parasites of the family Kinetoplastidae cause a range of \nhuman diseases, including the leishmaniases and African Sleeping Sickness. These \ninfections are of increasing prevalence, particularly in developing countries, and have \nbeen classified by the World Health Organisation as Category I emerging or uncontrolled \ndiseases (Remme, et al. 2002). For example, the Leishmania spp. (the causative agents of \nthe leishmaniases) infect more than 12 million people in five continents and are endemic in \n88 nation states putting over 350 million people at risk, with instances of leishmaniasis not \nuncommon in certain regions of North America and southern Europe. Moreover, the \nspread and severity of disease is exacerbated by its status as an important co-infection in \nAIDS patients and the overlap in prevalence of HIV and Leishmania (Alvar, et al. 2008). In \nthe absence of effective vaccines, the treatment of kinetoplastid infections is difficult with \nthe most serious visceral form of leishmaniasis often requiring a long, costly course of drug \ntherapy. In addition, available drugs often exhibit serious side-effects and resistance is \nrapidly emerging (Remme, et al. 2002). These facts make the discovery and validation of \nnew therapeutic agents a priority. \nThe diverse, amphipathic sphingolipids consist of a sphingoside backbone with long-chain \nbase and polar alcohol attachments. These essential lipid species are found in all \neukaryotic cells, as well as in some prokaryotic organisms and viruses (Smith and Merrill \n2002). In eukaryotes, the unmodified sphingolipid, ceramide, is a precursor for the \nsynthesis of complex sphingolipids in the Golgi apparatus. The resultant lipid species are \nsubsequently concentrated in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. Here, together \nwith sterols, they form the microdomains known as lipid rafts (Futerman and Hannun \n2004). Such domains have been suggested to be central to a wide array of cellular \nprocesses, including the formation of signal transduction complexes (Magee, et al. 2002; \nPierce 2002) and the polarized trafficking of lipid-modified proteins (Brown and London \n1998). Importantly, sphingolipid metabolites such as ceramide and phosphorylated \nsphingosine (sphingosine-1-phosphate), are also involved in the intracellular signal \ntransduction processes that regulate cell growth, differentiation and programmed cell \ndeath (apoptosis) (Futerman and Hannun 2004). \nSphingolipids demonstrate structural divergence in evolution. Whilst sphingomyelin (SM) is \nthe predominant phosphosphingolipid (PSL) of mammalian cells, inositol \nphosphorylceramide (IPC) is found in the fungi, plants and some protozoa but not in \n 4 \nmammals (Lester and Dickson 1993; Sperling and Heinz 2003). SM is formed by the \ntransfer of the phosphorylcholine head group from the phospholipid phosphatidylcholine \n(PC) to ceramide, a reaction catalyzed by SM synthase (Huitema, et al. 2004). The related \nenzyme, IPC synthase, mediates the formation of IPC in fungi, plants and the pathogenic \nkinetoplastid protozoa (e.g. Leishmania spp.) by catalyzing the transfer of \nphosphorylinositol from phosphatidylinositol (PI) to ceramide or phytoceramide (Becker \nand Lester 1980; Bromley, et al. 2003; Denny, et al. 2006). In the fungi this enzyme activity \nhas been attributed to the AUR1p protein first identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and \nsubsequently in several fungal pathogens (Heidler and Radding 1995; Heidler and \nRadding 2000). We have isolated a functional orthologue of this protein in the \nkinetoplastid, protozoan parasite Leishmania major (LmjIPCS) (Denny, et al. 2006). \nLmjIPCS is encoded by a single gene (GeneDB, LmjF35.4990), and closely related \northologues are found in the complete genome sequences of the related kinetoplastid \npathogens, Trypanosoma brucei (the causative agent of African Sleeping Sickness) and T. \ncruzi (Chagas Disease) (Denny, et al. 2006). IPC synthase activity is evident in both the \ninsect and mammalian stages of the L. major lifecycle, however in the intra-macrophage \nform the parasite is predicted to scavenge host cell ceramide for use as substrate by \nLmjIPCS (Zhang, et al. 2005; Zhang, et al. 2009). \nAs an essential activity with no mammalian equivalent the fungal IPC synthase has \nbecome a recognized and well studied drug target (Georgopapadakou 2000; Nagiec, et al. \n1997). The discovery of functional orthologues in the kinetoplastid pathogenic protozoa \nhas led to its further consideration as an anti-protozoal target (Suzuki, et al. 2008). It is \nknown that LmjIPCS activity is susceptible to the established fungal inhibitor aureobasidin \nA (Denny, et al. 2006). In addition, this compound has been demonstrated to inhibit the \ngrowth and infectivity of L. amazonensis (Tanaka, et al. 2007). Furthermore, recent work in \nour laboratory (Mina, et al. 2009) and elsewhere (Sutterwala, et al. 2008) has both \ngenetically and pharmacologically validated the kinetoplastid enzyme as a target in T. \nbrucei. Therefore, further study of the LmjIPCS (and other kinetoplastid orthologues) is \nvital in moving towards the ultimate goal of identifying compounds with the potential for \ndevelopment into much needed, pharmacologically active anti-protozoals. Herein we \nreport the establishment of a robust 96-well plate based assay system that uses easily \nobtainable, transgenic yeast-derived material, together with its application to detail the \nkinetic parameters of LmjIPCS and demonstrate the inhibitory effects of several substrate \nanalogues.  \n \n 5 \n2. Materials and Methods \n \n2.1. Materials \nPhosphatidylinositol (bovine liver PI; predominant species 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-\nglycero-3-phospho-1'-myo-inositol sodium salt) was from Avanti Polar Lipids. D-erythro-\nsphingosine (d18:1; sphing-4-enine, (2S,3R,E)-2-aminooctadec-4-ene-1,3-diol) and N-\nacetyl-D-erythro sphingosine (d18:1\/2:0; N-acetyl-sphing-4-enine, (2S,3R,4E)-N-acetyl-2-\naminooctadec-4-ene-1,3-diol) were from TOCRIS BioScience. C18-Ceramide (d18:1\/18:0; \nN-stearoyl-D-erythro-sphingosine, (2S,3R,4E) N-stearoyl-2-aminooctadec-4-ene-1,3-diol) \nand diacylglycerol (1-octadecanoyl-2-(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z-eicosatetraenoyl)-sn-glycerol) were \nfrom Sigma Aldrich. NBD-C6-ceramide (N-[6-[(7-nitro-2-1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-\nyl)amino]hexanoyl]-D-erythro-sphingosine) was from Invitrogen. \n \n2.2. Preparation of LmjIPCS microsomal material \nAuxotrophic AUR1 mutant Saccharomyces cerevisiae was complemented by the \nexpression of the L. major IPC synthase to create YPH499\u2013HIS\u2013GAL\u2013AUR1 pRS246 \nLmjIPCS (Denny, et al. 2006). These cells were propagated in SD medium (0.17% Bacto \nyeast nitrogen base, 0.5% ammonium sulphate and 2% dextrose) containing the \nappropriate nutritional supplements, and microsomes prepared from an exponentially \ngrowing culture (Fischl et al., 2000). Briefly, approximately 8.0 g of wet cell mass was \nsuspended in STE buffer (25 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4, 250 mM sucrose and 1 mM EDTA) \ncontaining Complete\u00ae EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche Applied Science) and \nthe yeast disrupted by vortex mixing with pre-chilled acid-washed glass beads (425-600 \n\u00b5m, Sigma Aldrich). After the removal of the glass beads, unbroken cells and cell-wall \ndebris by centrifugation (1500g, 4\u00b0C and 15 minutes), the microsomal membrane fraction \nwas isolated by differential centrifugation. Subsequently the large granular fraction was \nremoved (27000 g, 4 \u00b0C and 30 minutes) and the microsomal membrane fraction isolated \n(150000 g, 4 \u00b0C and 90 minutes). The microsomes were re-suspended at a concentration \nof 10 mg.ml-1 in storage buffer (50 mM Tris\/HCl pH 7.4, 20% (v\/v) glycerol, 5 mM MgCl2) \ncontaining protease inhibitor. As required, the microsomal membranes were washed in \n2.5% CHAPS (Sigma Aldrich; 4 \u00b0C, 60 minutes), isolated by centrifugation (150000 g, 4\u00b0C \nand 90 minutes), assayed for protein content (CBQCA, Invitrogen) and re-suspended in \nstorage buffer. A second wash inactivated the enzyme. \nDifferent preparations of microsomal membranes were utilized in this study and these \nvaried in specific LmjIPCS enzyme activity. Therefore, to standardise the assay material \n 6 \nsamples were normalized with respect to active enzyme content ensuring consistency \nacross experiments. Although the standardised unit for enzymatic activity is the katal \nwhere 1 kat = 1 mol(product).s\u22121 (International Union of Biochemistry, 1979), for the range \nof substrates concentrations used in the work presented here a more practical value is \nenzyme unit (U). One unit (U) of enzyme is defined as that which converts 1 pmol of \nsubstrate per minute under the conditions described (1 U = 1 pmol(product).min\u22121), where \n1 U corresponds to 16.67 femtokats (Fischl et al., 2000). The conversion of the fluorescent \nacceptor substrate NBD-C6-ceramide to the product NBD-C6-IPC was measured and \nquantified with respect to known concentrations of NBD-C6-ceramide, activity calculated as \nU.\u00b5l-1 and the samples were stored at -80 \u00b0C until use. Enzyme turnover was calculated \nper milligrams of total protein in the sample (U.mg-1). \n \n2.3. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) based LmjIPCS synthase assay \nBoth unwashed and CHAPS-washed (1 \u00b5g) microsomal membranes were used in a 50 \u00b5l \nassay mix containing 1 mM PI, 100 mM Tris HCl (pH7.4) and 200 \u00b5M NBD-C6-ceramide \n(Figueiredo et al., 2005). The reaction was pre-incubated before the addition of the NBD-\nC6-ceramide at 30 \u00b0C (the established optimum temperature in the assay) for 30 minutes \nand subsequently for a further hour before quenching with 150 \u00b5l of \nchloroform:methanol:water (10:10:3). After biphasic separation the organic layer was \nremoved, dried in a rotavapor (Eppendorf Concentrator 5301) and re-suspended in 20 \u00b5l of \n10:10:3. The reaction products were fractionated using HPTLC silica plates (Merck) and \nthe eluent system chloroform:methanol:aqueous 0.25% KCl (55:45:10). The Rf values for \nthe substrate, NBD-C6-ceramide, and the product, NBD-C6-IPC were 0.96 and 0.57 \nrespectively. Quantification was carried out using a FLA3000 scanner (Fujifilm) and AIDA \nImage Analyzer\u00ae software (version 3.52). \n  \n2.4. 96-well plate-based LmjIPCS synthase assay for kinetic analyses \nCHAPS-washed membranes (Aeed, et al. 2004), 0.6 U or as described, were used in a \nreaction mix containing 100 \u00b5M (or as indicated) PI, 50 mM KH2PO4 (pH7.0) and 5 \u00b5M (or \nas indicated) NBD-C6-ceramide. Following pre-incubation at 30\u00b0C for 30 minutes, the \nreaction was initiated by the addition of the NBD-C6-ceramide (5 \u00b5M or as indicated) and \n2.4 mM CHAPS. The reaction was incubated for the specified period of time and \nsubsequently quenched by the addition of 200 \u00b5l of methanol. Separation of the reaction \nproduct, NBD-C6-IPC, from the substrate NBD-C6-ceramide was achieved by applying the \n 7 \nreaction mix to 100 \u00b5l (sedimented gel volume) of AG4-X4 resin (BioRad), formate form, in \n96-well Multiscreen\uf8e8 Solvinert filter plates (Millipore) using a vacuum manifold (Millipore). \nThe resin was washed 5 times with 200 \u00b5l methanol, the product was eluted into \nOptiPlate\uf8ea 96-F plates (Perkin Elmer) using 200 \u00b5l of 1 M potassium formate in methanol \nand quantified using a fluorescence plate reader (FLx800\u2122, BioTek) - excitation \u03bb = 485 \nnm; emission \u03bb = 528 nm. Assays used were carried out in triplicate and results analysed \nusing Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad) and Excel\u00ae Solver Add-in (Microsoft Office). The \nseparation protocol was validated by collecting fractions from a 5-fold scale up of the \nprocess and fractionating them by TLC as above (figure 1). \nSubstrate analogues were employed in inhibition studies and added with the fluorescent \nsubstrate NBD-C6-ceramide in the quantities indicated. \nThe assay system was validated as excellent for screening purposes with a Z\u2019 value of \n0.58  (Zhang, et al. 1999). Calculation of this value utilized 2 bespoke inhibitors, (4E) N-\n(phenylacetyl)-1-deoxy-sphing-4-enine and (2R,4E) N-phenylacetyl2-aminooctadec-4-en-\n1-ol whose synthesis and screening will be subsequently reported. \n \n2.5. Mass spectrometry \nAnalyses were performed on an LTQFT (ThermoFinnigan Corp); an FTICR MS instrument \nequipped with a 7.0 T magnet.  Chloroform extracts were introduced into the electrospray \nion source by direct infusion from a syringe at a flow rate of 3 \u00b5l.min-1.  Positive ion \nmeasurements were made with the source voltage at 4.0 kV and negative ion \nmeasurements were made with the source voltage at 3.5 kV. The tube lens was kept at \n100 V and the source temperature at 275 \u00b0C for all experiments. \n \n2.6. Cytotoxicity screening \nL. major (MHOM\/IL\/81\/Friedlin)\u2029 and L. mexicana (MNYC\/BZ\/62\/M379)\u2029 parasites were \nmaintained at 26 \u00b0C in Schneider\u2019s Drosophila media (Sigma Aldrich) supplemented with \nheat inactivated foetal bovine sera (15% for promastigotes and 20% for amastigotes; \nBiosera). L. mexicana promastigotes were transformed into axenic amastigotes by a pH \nand temperature shift as previously described (Bates, 1994). In 96-well plates (Nunc) \nparasites at 105ml-1 were incubated with compounds in triplicate (including miltefosine \n(Cayman Chemical) as a positive control, and untreated parasites and media as negative \ncontrols) for 24 hours before incubation with Alamar Blue (Invitrogen) for 4 hours prior to \nassessing cell viability using a fluorescent plate reader (Biotek; 560EX nm\/600EM nm). \n 8 \nLD50 was calculated after plotting cell viability (as % of untreated control) against log \ncompound concentration (\u00b5M). \n \n \n \n 9 \n3. Results and Discussion  \n \n3.1. Assay of LmjIPCS microsomal material \nThe high levels of endogenous PI present in yeast microsomes (Aeed, et al. 2004) \nrendered establishing the kinetic parameters of LmjIPCS with respect to this donor \nsubstrate problematic. Initial assay experiments using unrefined material derived from \nLmjIPCS complemented HIS-GAL-AUR1 auxotrophic yeast IPCS mutants (Denny, et al. \n2006) demonstrated that endogenous, microsomal PI accounted for approximately 25% of \nthe measured LmjIPCS turnover (figure 2A), making accurate determination of the enzyme \nkinetic parameters impossible. A similar problem has previously been identified with the \nuse of Trypanosoma cruzi derived microsomes in an assay of TcIPCS turnover \n(Figueiredo, et al. 2005 ). However, it has been demonstrated that washing microsomal \nmembranes derived from the pathogenic yeast, Candida albicans with a zwitterionic \ndetergent (CHAPS) removed endogenous substrate lipids without affecting IPCS activity \n(Aeed, et al. 2004). Adopting this approach and employing microsomes from LmjIPCS \ncomplemented HIS-GAL-AUR1 yeast, washed with CHAPS as described, the parasite \nenzyme assay proved to be dependent not only on the addition of the fluorescent acceptor \nsubstrate, NBD-C6-ceramide, but now also more than 90% dependent on the addition of \nthe donor substrate (bovine liver PI; figure 2A). It has previously been demonstrated that \nthe S. cerevisiae orthologous enzyme, AUR1p, is unable to utilise bovine liver PI (Mina, et \nal. 2009). In the present assay system, the CHAPS-washed microsomes also \ndemonstrated an approximately 2-fold higher level of enzyme turnover than equivalent \nquantities of crude material (figure 2B). This increase is most likely due to enrichment of \nthe sample for LmjIPCS as other proteins are washed away from the detergent insoluble \nmaterial. However, the removal of microsomal proteins and lipids may also reduce the \nspatial volume of the washed material leading to more rapid diffusion of applied \nexogenous substrates into the membranes. Taken together these data indicate that \nwashing the microsomes with CHAPS depletes them of PI, and perhaps (phyto)ceramide, \nthereby facilitating more accurate determination of the kinetics of LmjIPCS. Moreover, the \nfact that LmjIPCS remained highly active within a detergent resistant lipid environment \nsuggests that the enzyme may reside within CHAPS-resistant lipid microdomains in vivo \n(Rouvinski, et al. 2003). \n \n 10 \n3.2. Determination of LmjIPCS assay parameters \nUsing the 96-well plate formatted system described, reproducible, quantitative kinetic data \ncould be obtained for the enzyme from CHAPS-washed LmjIPCS yeast microsomes. In \nthe first instance the formation of product (IPC) over time was determined. The results \ndemonstrated that the reaction rate is linear for 30 minutes before it decreases over time \n(figure 3A). As a consequence all subsequent assays were performed with a 15 minute \nreaction time to ensure linearity under the specified conditions, turnover was assumed to \nbe equivalent to initial velocity (v0).  \nSince both substrates are in excess and only approximately 12 % of the limiting acceptor \nsubstrate, NBD-C6-ceramide, is consumed after 1 hour, the reasons for the decrease in \nreaction rate above 30 minutes are unclear. The IPC product may be localised around the \nenzyme affecting a change in the diffusion rate of the substrates to the active site. It is also \npossible that LmjIPCS activity is modulated by inhibitory feedback from the synthesized \nNBD-C6-IPC or diacylglycerol (DAG) which is formed as a by-product of IPC synthase \nturnover (Denny, et al. 2006).  Analysis of the inhibitory affect of DAG indicated a logIC50 \nvalue of 0.92\u00b10.8 and an IC50 of 8.3 \u00b5M (figure 3B) supporting the latter hypothesis. \nProduct (NBD-C6-IPC) formation also increased in a linear manner with increasing enzyme \nconcentration up to 0.8 U\/assay (figure 3C). However, the linear relationship deviated \nbeyond this point (data not shown). Notably, increasing the concentration of enzyme also \nleads to a change in the protein : lipid : detergent (CHAPS) ratio and hence modulates the \nsubstrate concentration at the active site of LmIPCS. Taking this observation into account \n0.6 U of LmIPCS (within the linear range) was employed in all subsequent analyses.  \n 11 \n3.3 Determination of LmjIPCS kinetic parameters \nHaving established a standardized set of conditions that gave a linear response, and in \nwhich endogenous interfering substrate was minimized by detergent washing, the kinetic \nparameters of LmjIPCS with respect to both the acceptor (NBD-C6-ceramide) and donor \n(PI) substrates were determined. Initially, the data obtained were tested against the \nMichaelis-Menten model and with respect to increasing concentrations of NBD-C6-\nceramide gave a curve of good fit (R2 = 0.97; figure 4A). The apparent Km for the acceptor \nsubstrate was 3.5\u00b10.35 \u00b5M and the apparent Vmax 2.1\u00b10.07 pmol.min\u22121.U\u22121. However, \ndetermination of the Hill constant revealed a Hill slope of 2.7 that indicated co-operative \nbinding of substrates was occurring (Hill 1910). \nIn contrast, with [NBD-C6-ceramide] fixed at 5 \u00b5M, the data with respect to the PI showed \na poor fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation (R2 = 0.82; figure 4B), with considerable \ndeviation at high concentrations of donor substrate. The enzyme orthologue from the \npathogenic yeast C. albicans has previously been shown to behave in a similar manner, a \nphenomenon which was described as being caused by substrate inhibition (Aeed, et al. \n2004). However, at a higher, saturating concentration of the acceptor substrate, [NBD-C6-\nceramide] = 20 \u00b5M (> 5x apparent Km), no apparent inhibition at high [PI] could be \ndetected (figure 4C). This strongly suggested that activity is dependent on the substrate \nmolar ratio, with a dilution effect being observed with low NBD-C6-ceramide (5 \u00b5M) and \nhigh PI (>150 \u00b5M). The % molar concentration of NBD-C6-ceramide dropped 30% from \n0.82% at 12.5 \u00b5M PI and 600 \u00b5M CHAPS to 0.58% 250 \u00b5M PI and 600 \u00b5M CHAPS. In \ncontrast a change in concentration of the acceptor substrate has little affect on the % \nmolar concentration of PI (14.3% at 1 \u00b5M NBD-C6-ceramide and 600 \u00b5M CHAPS to 13.9% \n20 \u00b5M NBD-C6-ceramide NBD-C6-ceramide and 600 \u00b5M CHAPS) and CHAPS \nconcentration. \nPI vesicles can be solubilised by CHAPS far below the CMC of this detergent at 0.27 mM \n([Dw]c : critical concentration of free detergent; Sch\u00fcrholz 1996). Therefore under the \nexperimental conditions employed (0.6mM CHAPS) in the assay system PI\/CHAPS mixed \nmicelles are formed. The molar detergent to lipid ration of these micelles (Rc) is 0.17, \nmeaning that CHAPS is a minor component, approximately 15% of the total molar \nconcentration in micelles (Sch\u00fcrholz 1996). Based on these data the [Dw]c in the assay \nsystem employed can be calculated using Equation 1 (Sch\u00fcrholz 1996). \n 12 \n \n \nEquation 1 \nAt [DT]c= 600 \u00b5M in the reaction mix the [Dw]c (270\u00b5M) is exceeded under all conditions \nemployed in this study and CHAPS exists primarily in a monomeric form with a minor \nproportion associated with PI in micelles (2.8% at 100\u00b5M PI).  \nGiven the fact in this complex system the LmjIPCS is a membrane enzyme acting on lipid \nsubstrates within mixed micelles the deviation from Michaelis-Mention kinetics observed is \nunsurprising. To facilitate further analyses a number of assumptions were made, namely: \nthe kinetic parameters would be determined using the steady state approach; initial rate \nassumptions are applied; PI\/CHAPS micelles have a low molar % of CHAPS \n(approximately 15%); all lipids and detergent molecules have the same surface area; all \nlipids and detergent molecules have equal accessibility to the enzyme active site. All \nconcentrations are expressed as molar fractions of total lipid plus detergent \nSubsequently a series of assay reactions were carried out with varying acceptor substrate \nconcentrations, [NBD-C6-ceramide], at different fixed [PI] (12.5 \u2212 100 \u00b5M). A global \nanalysis of the data points (56 mean points of 168 replicates) employing the surface \ndilution kinetic model, which considers the surface concentration of lipids ([PI] and [Cer] \nexpressed as mol% in PI\/CHAPS micelles; Deems, et al. 1975), resulted in non-\nconvergent results. However, given that LmjIPCS is an integral membrane protein within \nmicrosomal membranes the enzyme can fuse with PI\/CHAPS micelles, or maintain its \nintegrity and bounce between micelles whilst interacting with the bulk monomeric \nCHAPS\/NBD-C6-ceramide in the assay buffer. Both cases would confer bulk concentration \ndependence to the kinetics (Carman, et al. 1995).  \nLineweaver-Burk analyses of the data set gave a near parallel pattern (figure 5A), with a \nplot of the intercepts demonstrating a linear correlation to 1 \/ [PI] molar % (figure 5B). A \nsubsequent global analysis of these data in terms of a generalised form of a bi-bi substrate \nkinetic equation (Engel 1977; Equation 2) provided a solution for the values of the \nequation parameters, where \u00d80 = 0.26, \u00d8A = 0.82, \u00d8B = 0.14, \u00d8AB = 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22125. From these \nVmax  = 2.31 pmol.min-1.min-1, Km [PI] = 3.15 molar % and Km [NBD-C6-ceramide] = 0.54 \nmolar %.  \n 13 \n \n \nEquation 2 \nNotably, the relatively high affinity of the acceptor substrate for LmjIPCS compared with \nthat of the donor PI was consistent with the proposal that ceramide, a highly bioactive \nmolecule, is the rate-limiting substrate in the in situ IPC synthase reaction. In contrast PI is \na relatively abundant substrate in most membraneous environments (Aeed, et al. 2004; \nDickson 1998; Leber, et al. 1995). \nBased on these data the value \u00d8AB was assumed to be zero thereby reducing Equation 2 \nto that describing double displacement kinetics (Equation 3). Details of the factors of \u00d80, \n\u00d8A , \u00d8B is detailed in supplementary data (S1). \n \n \nEquation 3 \nThese analyses provide strong support for the notion that LmjIPCS functions via a double \ndisplacement model. This is further evidenced by the close correlation of experimental \ndata with simulations derived from Equation 3 (figure 5C and D). \nWith this in mind, the apparent fit to the Michaelis-Menton model with respect to ceramide \ninitially observed was most likely due to pre-incubation with saturating levels of PI leaving \nthe majority of the enzyme in an intermediate phosphorylated state. In this state it is \npredicted that LmjIPCS has mediated the transfer of the phosphorylinositol group of PI to \nthe reactive histidine within the identified catalytic triad (Denny, et al. 2006) with the \nconcomitant release of DAG. Notably mutation of His-294 within the yeast AUR1p triad \nhas been shown to result in non-viable haploid cells (Levine, et al. 2000) and the \nequivalent mutation (His-264) in LmjIPCS rendered it unable to complement auxotrophic \nAUR1p mutant yeast (Mina and Denny, unpublished). The second step in the reaction is \nthen initiated by the addition of acceptor substrate (ceramide) when the phosphorylated \nintermediate is subjected to nucleophilic attack by the oxygen of the ceramide hydroxyl \ngroup, resulting in phosphoryl group transfer to the sphingoid base thus forming IPC.  \n  \n 14 \n \n3.4. Substrate analogues as competitive inhibitors \nThe delineation of the kinetic parameters of LmjIPCS also provided the opportunity to \nbegin to further understand the mode of action of this enzyme and perhaps, via a rational \napproach, to design specific inhibitors. Given the high affinity of the acceptor substrate for \nLmjIPCS, the ability of natural ceramide (Cer; 18:1\/18:0; N-stearoyl-D-erythro-sphingosine) \nand the ceramide analogues D-erythro-sphingosine and N-acetyl-D-erythro-sphingosine to \ncompete with fluorescent NBD-C6-ceramide was analyzed, with variation in the quantity of \nthe product (NBD-C6-IPC) reflecting the effect of the substrate competitors on enzyme \nturnover. \nUnlike N-acetyl-D-erythro-sphingosine and D-erythro-sphingosine, N-stearoyl-D-erythro-\nsphingosine was insufficiently soluble in the phosphate-based buffer employed for the \nmicrotitre plate assay, curtailing analysis. This problem could be circumvented by using a \nTris-based buffer system containing defatted-BSA. Here N-stearoyl-D-erythro-sphingosine \nwas soluble and the results indicated that NBD-C6-ceramide exhibited an affinity for \nLmjIPCS equivalent to that of the natural substrate (data not shown). Analyses of the more \nsoluble synthetic analogues, N-acetyl-D-erythro-sphingosine and D-erythro-sphingosine, \nusing the phosphate-based buffer system in the 96-well plate based assay demonstrated \nthat they are, as expected, competitive with respect to NBD-C6-ceramide: IC50 values of 16 \n\u00b5M and 52 \u00b5M respectively (figure 6A and B). Subsequent MS-ES+\/ES\u2212 analyses of the \nreaction product profiles (figure 7) revealed the presence of a mass of 582.3 \ncorresponding to IP-N-acetyl-D-erythro-sphingosine confirming that N-acetyl-D-erythro-\nsphingosine had been turned over by LmjIPCS. This was expected as this ceramide \nanalogue has previously been shown to act as a substrate for the yeast enzyme (Nagiec, \net al. 1997). Conversely, no IP-D-erythro-sphingosine could be detected in the MS spectra \neither in positive or negative ion mode, which indicated that D-erythro-sphingosine is not a \nsubstrate for LmjIPCS, rather it is acting as a true inhibitor (data not shown). Screening \nthis inhibitor against L. major and L. mexicana promastigotes (insect stage) and L. \nmexicana amastigotes (mammalian stage) demonstrated its efficacy against both species \nand lifecycle stages (LD50 of 6.5\u00b5M, 8.2 \u00b5M and 13.3\u00b5M respectively; table 1). It should be \nnoted that it is unclear whether this was a target specific effect, however the substrate \nanalogue N-acetyl-sphingosine was considerably less cytotoxic such that it was not \npossible to determine its LD50 versus L. mexicana amastigotes (table 1). \n 15 \nIn structure-function terms these data indicated that the free-amino group present in D-\nerythro-sphingosine abolishes enzyme activity, whilst masking this group with even a \nminimal acyl moiety (N-acetyl-D-erythro-sphingosine) restored it. Similarly, sphingosine \nanalogues have demonstrated an inhibitory effort on the S. cerevisiae phosphatidate \nphosphatase (Wu, et al. 1993), a member of the LPP enzyme superfamily which are \nbelieved to share a mechanism of action with the sphingolipid synthases (Huitema, et al. \n2004). Taken together it may be hypothesized that the protonated free-amino group of D-\nerythro-sphingosine electrostatically interferes with the active site of these enzymes, an \nobservation which may potentially be exploited in the rational design of specific enzyme \ninhibitors. \n \n4. Summary \n \nUsing the multi-well format assay established in this work we have deduced the kinetic \nparameters of LmjIPCS with respect to both the donor (PI) and acceptor (NBD-C6-\nceramide) substrates, and provided evidence that the enzyme functions through a bi-bi \n(ping-pong) substrate kinetic model. These data provide the first direct indication of the \nmechanism of action of the sphingolipid synthase family. Such analyses would not have \nbeen possible using a conventional assay system such as that previously employed for the \nT. cruzi orthologue (Figueiredo, et al. 2005). However, by employing a complemented \nyeast system, large quantities of active LmjIPCS could be isolated in a cost effective \nmanner avoiding the handling of pathogenic material. Furthermore washing the \nmicrosomal starting material with CHAPS removed endogenous, contaminating donor \nsubstrate (PI) leaving an environment in which the enzyme exhibited not only a \ndependency on exogenous PI, but also a higher level of specific activity.  \nWith a Z\u2019 value of 0.58 (Zhang, et al. 1999), the assay system described lends itself to \nhigh-throughput screening for inhibitors of a protozoal enzyme activity that has been \ndemonstrated to be essential for kinetoplastid pathogens (Mina, et al. 2009; Sutterwala, et \nal. 2008). The assay of ceramide analogues demonstrated this potential and provides the \nbackbone for consideration of rationally designed enzyme inhibitors. In the longer term, it \nis hoped that it will assist in the discovery of new, much needed therapies for \nleishmaniasis and African sleeping sickness. \n \n 16 \nAcknowledgements \n \nThis work was funded by Biotechnology and Biological Research Council (BB\/D52396X\/1) \nand Royal Society (2005\/R1) grants to PWD and a British Council\/Deutscher \nAkademischer Austausch Dienst Academic Research Collaboration Award to PWD and \nRTS.
