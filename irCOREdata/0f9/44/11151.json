A quantitative analysis is presented of the FAST\nsatellite electric field and particle flux data during an EISCAT\nheating experiment run on 8 October 1998. Radio frequency\nheating, modulated at 3 Hz, launched ULF waves from the\nionosphere into the lower magnetosphere. The ULF waves\nwere observed in FAST data and constituted the first satellite\ndetection of artificially excited Alfve\u00b4nic ULF waves. The\ndownward electron flux data for this event contain the first\nobservations of electrons undergoing acceleration within the\nIonospheric Alfve\u00b4n Resonator (IAR) due to parallel electric\nfields associated with an artificially stimulated Alfve\u00b4n wave.\nThe time history and spectral content of the observed down-\nward electron fluxes is investigated by considering the ef-\nfects of a localised parallel electric field. Furthermore, it\nis demonstrated that a power law electron energy distribu-\ntion describes the time-variable observed fluxes better than a\nMaxwellian distribution.\nKey words. Ionosphere (active experiments; particle accel-\neration) \u2013 Magnetospheric physics (electric fields)\n1 Introduction\nIt is increasingly understood that Alfve\u00b4n waves play an im-\nportant role in coupling the magnetosphere and the iono-\nsphere. In particular, observations from auroral sounding\nrockets and various satellites have established Alfve\u00b4n waves\nas being responsible for the acceleration of charged particles\nalong geomagnetic field lines, which results in auroral pre-\ncipitation. For example, Ivchenko et al. (1999) reported a\nquasi-periodic structure in magnetic field, electric field and\nparticle flux data from the Auroral Turbulence II sounding\nrocket as it crossed the border of an auroral arc. Their anal-\nysis indicated that an Alfve\u00b4n wave of small transverse scale\nhad caused field-aligned precipitation. Furthermore, Chaston\net al. (1999, 2000) found that Alfve\u00b4n waves observed by the\nCorrespondence to: S. R. Cash (srcash@ion.le.ac.uk)\nFAST satellite were directly associated with dispersed elec-\ntron signatures in the dayside auroral oval.\nRecently, an ionospheric heating experiment utilising the\nEuropean Incoherent SCATter radar (EISCAT) high power\nfacility at Troms\u00f8, Norway, was run in order to investigate\nthe link between Alfve\u00b4n waves and the acceleration of pre-\ncipitating field-aligned particles in an active manner. Results\nfrom this experiment have been reported in papers by Robin-\nson et al. (2000) and Kolesnikova et al. (2002). In these\nreports, the particle acceleration process was explained by\nconsideration of the properties of Alfve\u00b4n waves within the\nIonospheric Alfve\u00b4n Resonator (IAR). The IAR is the term\ngiven to the vertical structure associated with the decay in\nplasma density going from the ionosphere into the magne-\ntosphere, causing trapping of shear Alfve\u00b4n waves due to the\nresulting large Alfve\u00b4n velocity gradient. The lower bound-\nary of the IAR in the ionosphere can be taken as the altitude\nwhere the angular frequency of the Alfve\u00b4n wave matches the\nion-neutral collision frequency (Borisov and Stubbe, 1997),\nwhereas the upper boundary corresponds to where the Alfve\u00b4n\nwaves of interest undergo partial reflection. This occurs at an\naltitude somewhat below that where the Alfve\u00b4n velocity max-\nimises. Due to electron inertial effects, an Alfve\u00b4n wave ac-\nquires a significant parallel electric field component near the\nupper IAR boundary (Lysak, 1993; Robinson et al., 2000).\nThis electric field may effectively accelerate suprathermal\nelectrons.\nThe EISCAT high power facility (heater) at Troms\u00f8, Nor-\nway has been used since 1980 to generate artificial mag-\nnetic pulsations via modulated HF heating of the ionosphere\n(Stubbe et al., 1977, 1982). There have also been obser-\nvations of heater-induced electromagnetic VLF waves by\nspacecraft (James et al., 1990; Kimura et al., 1994). How-\never, the results from an experiment on 8 October 1998 re-\nported by Robinson et al. (2000) represent the first spacecraft\ndetection of artificially excited ULF waves. Furthermore, the\nobserved downward electron fluxes constitute the first direct\nevidence for electron acceleration in the IAR by an artifi-\ncially stimulated Alfve\u00b4n wave.\n1500 S. R.

Schematic showing the EISCAT heater modulating the con-\nductivity in the E-region ionosphere where naturally occurring cur-\nrents such as the electrojet are modulated by the heating modulation\nfrequency of 3 Hz. This launches a 3 Hz ULF wave along the geo-\nmagnetic field lines that is detected directly by the FAST satellite.\nAt the IAR the wave acquires a significant parallel electric field,\nwhich accelerates the downward moving electrons that are detected\nby FAST at each edge of the wave propagation region (after Robin-\nson et al. 2000).\nFollowing on from the initial report by Robinson et\nal. (2000), in a second paper, Kolesnikova et al. (2002) mod-\nelled the Alfve\u00b4n wave field in the inhomogeneous plasma\nalong a field line from the lower ionosphere, where the mod-\nulated heating takes place, up into the magnetosphere, be-\nyond the altitude of the FAST satellite. Using the modelled\nwave fields, Kolesnikova et al. (2002) also made a prelimi-\nnary attempt to account for the observed electron flux oscil-\nlations by assuming Maxwellian particle distributions. This\nwas only partially successful. In the present paper, attention\nis focused on examining the spectral components in the data,\nand explaining the time history of the observed downward\nelectron fluxes in further detail. We use the values of the\nmodelled electric field in Kolesnikova et al. (2002) to inves-\ntigate the effects of a localised parallel electric field on the\nelectron energy distribution. Furthermore, it is demonstrated\nthat a power law electron energy distribution describes the\ntime-variable observed fluxes better than a Maxwellian dis-\ntribution.\nFAST mapped footprint: orbit 8426\n18.90 19.00 19.10 19.20 19.30 19.40 19.50 19.60\nGeographic latitude\n69.40\n69.50\n69.60\n69.70\nG\ne\no\ngr\na\nph\nic\n \nlo\nn\ngi\ntu\nde Heated region in ionosphere \n         at 100 km altitude\n20:16:19\n20:16:22\nFig.2.\nFig. 2.

The\nticks mark each second of data; the arrows show times when a 3 Hz\nsignal was observed in the FAST data shown in Fig. 3.\n2 Experimental conditions\nOn 8 October 1998, between 20:15 UT and 20:45 UT, the\nEISCAT heater transmitted 4.04 MHz X-mode polarised ra-\ndio waves into a cone of half-width 7\u25e6 (at 3 dB level), centred\nalong the direction of the local magnetic field. The HF sig-\nnal was modulated by a square wave with a fundamental fre-\nquency of 3 Hz and an effective radiated power of 144 MW.\nThis produced a heated layer a few km thick with an approxi-\nmately circular cross section of 25 km diameter at an altitude\nof about 80 km. This layer acted as the source for the ULF\nwaves (Robinson et al., 2000; Kolesnikova et al., 2002). This\nexperimental arrangement forms part of the schematic illus-\ntration in Fig. 1. The location of Troms\u00f8 (69.6\u25e6 N, 19.2\u25e6 E in\ngeographic coordinates) is within the auroral oval, and EIS-\nCAT UHF data during this experiment (see below for further\ndetails) indicated the presence of a significant electrojet cur-\nrent within the heated volume. The modulation of the heater\npower caused a modulation in the electrical conductivity at\nthe same frequency. Thus, natural electrojet currents were\nmodulated and acted as a source of ULF waves, which prop-\nagated up the magnetic field line. The heated region in the\nionosphere defines the spatial extent of the flux tube which\ncarries the ULF wave energy.\nThe FAST (Fast Auroral SnapshoT) satellite orbits the\nEarth at altitudes between 350 km and 4175 km at 83\u25e6 in-\nclination (Carlson et al., 1998). It has proved ideal for inves-\ntigating the low altitude auroral acceleration region due to\nits high spatial and temporal resolution. Just after 20:16 UT,\nFAST passed over Troms\u00f8 at an altitude of approximately\n2550 km. Figure 2 shows the spacecraft\u2019s mapped magnetic\nfootprint (using the IGRF model) down to 100 km altitude.\nThe two arrows indicate approximately the start and end of\nthe period during which the FAST electric field sensors reg-\nistered the signature of the ULF wave excited by the EISCAT\nheater.

The electric field compo-\nnent measured by the FAST instrument was oriented nearly\nperpendicular to the magnetic field (Carlson et al., 1998;\nRobinson et al., 2000) and exhibits 3 Hz oscillations (see be-\nlow for further details) from about 20:16:20 to 20:16:23 UT,\nwith an amplitude of approximately 2\u20135 mV m\u22121. These\ndata are shown in panel (a) of Fig. 3. The interval of ap-\nproximately 3\u20134 s in which 3 Hz oscillations were observed\nin the FAST instrument data is remarkably consistent with\nthe expected size and location of the flux tube generated by\nthe modulated heating regime. It should be noted that the\nagreement originally reported by Robinson et al. (2000) was\nsomewhat less good than that described here. This was due\nto a slight error in the original mapping calculation that has\nsince been rectified. It is also clear from Fig. 3 that lower\n(than 3 Hz) frequency oscillations of significant amplitude\nwere present outside the interval of the artificial event. These\noscillations are almost certainly natural in origin and are not\nconnected with the EISCAT heater.\nThe differential electron energy flux (DEF) data shown\nin panels (b) and (c) of Fig. 3 are from FAST\u2019s Stepped\nElectrostatic Analyser (SESA) instruments, which operate\nas spectrographs to take high time resolution (1.7 ms) elec-\ntron measurements in 16 pitch-angle bins (Carlson et al.,\n1998). Panel (b) contains the downward fluxes, while the\ncorresponding upward fluxes are displayed in panel (c). The\nDEF energy channels shown are those from the three lowest\nenergies, which have central energies of 32.3, 64.7 and 129.4\neV. These differential energy fluxes originated from parti-\ncles with trajectories in directions that were within 30\u25e6 of the\nmagnetic field direction. Clear signatures of 3 Hz oscillations\nin the downward fluxes are present, within roughly the same\ninterval when 3 Hz electric field oscillations appear. How-\never, crucially, no significant 3 Hz oscillations appear in the\nupward fluxes. These data provide unambiguous evidence\nfor electron acceleration from above the FAST spacecraft in\nthe flux tube, which maps to the heated volume, as discussed\nin detail by Robinson et al. (2000). However, the tempo-\nral structure of the 3 Hz signatures is somewhat complicated\nand will be discussed in more detail in the next section. In\norder to facilitate this more detailed discussion, the time se-\nries has been divided into two specific time intervals, which\n1502 S. R.

Power Profile from EISCAT UHF radar for 8 October 1998, 3.1 km resolution with 10 s integration.\nare indicated by coloured strips in Fig. 3. The yellow strip\nmarks interval 1, which is from 20:16:19 to 20:16:20 UT; the\npink strip marks interval 2, from 20:16:20 to 20:16:22 UT.\nThe whole time interval corresponding to the combination\nof intervals 1 and 2 is identical to the time between the ar-\nrows in Fig. 2. Interval 2 contains the clearest signature of\nthe 3 Hz oscillations in the downward electron flux (panel b).\nThe 3 Hz signature in the electric field extends throughout\nintervals 1 and 2. Interval 1 does contain a signature of a dis-\nturbance in the downward flux, but it is difficult to discern a\nclear oscillatory pattern. One important feature of the down-\nward flux data which is clearly exhibited in Fig. 3, and which\nhas played an essential feature in the interpretation of the\nevent, is the energy dispersion. These data exhibit time shifts\nbetween the peaks in the separate energy channels for both\nintervals 1 and 2. This feature strongly suggests that both\nof these enhanced flux features originate in acceleration pro-\ncesses above the satellite. Robinson et al. (2000) explained\nthe origin of the two separated flux enhancement events in\nterms of cross-field gradients in the region of enhanced con-\nductivity (see also the schematic illustration in Fig. 1). If\nthis region were a Gaussian, intervals 1 and 2 should be rea-\nsonably similar. The reason for their asymmetry is not well\nunderstood at present. A possible explanation may be that\nthe gradients first encountered by the FAST spacecraft (in-\nterval 1) may be steeper than those encountered during the\nexit from the heated region (interval 2). This might be due,\nfor example, to the field-aligned geometry of the heater beam\nwhich gives rise to a narrower intersection region between\nthe northern edge of the beam and the heated ionospheric\nlayer than that at the southern edge where the spacecraft exits\n(see Fig. 1). This is consistent with the relatively shorter du-\nration of interval 1 and would explain why no clear 3 Hz sig-\nnature was identifiable, since it lasted for a time shorter than\na wave period. It is also instructive to note that the strong\nburst of flux activity prior to interval 1 exhibits no energy\ndispersion and consequently, is not attributable to spatially\nand temporally localised acceleration from above the space-\ncraft.\nSupporting ground-based observations during the heating\nexperiment were also made by the EISCAT UHF radar (Rish-\nbeth and Williams, 1985). The SP-UK-HEAT experiment\non 8 October 1998 included UHF radar operation, with the\ntransmit\/receive antenna at Troms\u00f8 aligned along the local\nmagnetic field direction (geographic azimuth: 183.2\u25e6, ele-\nvation: 77.2\u25e6) and the remote site UHF receivers at Kiruna,\nSweden (67.9\u25e6 N, 20.4\u25e6 E) and Sodankyla\u00a8, Finland (67.4\u25e6 N,\n26.6\u25e6 E), intersecting the transmitter beam at the F-region al-\ntitude of 250 km. Four pulse schemes were transmitted: a\nlong pulse, an alternating code and two short pulse schemes.\nThe estimates of raw electron density as a function of alti-\ntude shown in Fig. 4 were obtained from one of the short\npulse schemes. The spatial resolution is 3.1 km and the time\nresolution is 10 s. The enhancements in electron density in\nthe EISCAT data in Fig. 4 provide clear evidence of electron\nprecipitation. This, together with magnetic fluctuations and\nPI2 waves seen by the IMAGE and SAMNET chains of mag-\nnetometers, indicates that a substorm onset occurred around\n20:00 UT, about 15 min before the FAST overhead pass of\nTroms\u00f8. In particular, the electron density data in Fig. 4\nexhibits bursts of precipitation associated with substorm on-\nset, starting from 20:13 UT. The electron density values dur-\ning these bursts are persistantly above 5 \u00b7 1011 m\u22123, with the\nhighest electron density reaching 2 \u00b7 1012 m\u22123. Kolesnikova\net al. (2002) suggested that this was important in making the\nartificial Alfve\u00b4n wave amplitudes large enough to be detected\nby FAST.\nFinally, analysis of the ground-based Kilpisjarvi Pulsation\nMagnetometer data during the period of modulated heating\nindicated that a strong 3 Hz wave was present in all compo-\nS.

These observations are all\nconsistent with an interpretation suggested by Robinson at al.\n(2000) that field-guided Alfve\u00b4nic ULF waves were launched\nby the modulated currents in the E-region heated layer.\n3 Time series analysis of the FAST data\nAlthough a 3 Hz signature has been referred to by Robin-\nson et al. (2000) and also in the previous section, no attempt\nhas yet been made to establish the precise spectral content\nof the data in Fig. 3. In order to achieve this, a Fast Fourier\nTransform (FFT) was applied to a sliding window for each\nof the time series. This produced an estimate of the time\ndependence of the amplitude of the 3 Hz signals. The re-\nsults for electric field, where a 4.0 s window was utilised,\nare displayed in Fig. 5 and those for the downward differ-\nential electron energy flux, where a 2.0 s window was used,\nare displayed in Fig. 6. A standard Hanning window (Lynn,\n1984) was used to minimize the number of terms in the fre-\nquency response of the window. This is effectively a raised\ncosine bell function applied to 10% of the data points at each\nedge of the window. The window was moved along the time\nseries by 0.05 s increments. In Fig. 5, the data time series\n1504 S. R.

Reciprocal velocity corresponding to each electron channel\nagainst lag time for interval 2 shown in pink on Fig. 3.\nfor the electric field is plotted in the upper panel, and in the\nlower panel the power (in arbitrary units) at the point in the\nfrequency spectrum corresponding to the 3 Hz peak (binned\nwith bandwidth of 0.5 Hz) is plotted against the time of the\nassociated sliding window midpoint. Time is measured in\nseconds after 20:16:10 UT in each case. A similar procedure\nis carried out for the electron flux data in Fig. 6, except that\nthe 3 Hz power is plotted in separate panels for each energy\nchannel.\nThe results in Fig. 5 (lower panel) indicate that the am-\nplitude of the 3 Hz component in the electric field spectrum\nwas only enhanced during the 4 s interval already identified\nabove. Of course, due to the usual compromise between\nspectral and temporal resolution inherent in Fourier meth-\nods, the time resolution of this data is limited by the 4-s time\nwindow used. This was chosen, somewhat arbitrarily, to pro-\nvide a frequency resolution of slightly better than 10% of\nthe centre frequency, giving (3.0 \u00b1 0.25) Hz. However, the\nmethod does provide convincing evidence for the onset of the\nstimulated 3 Hz signal in the electric field, which constitutes\nthe local detection of the upward propagating 3 Hz Alfve\u00b4n\nwave by the FAST satellite. Similar evidence for 3 Hz sig-\nnals in the 3 energy channels of the upward electron fluxes is\nalso exhibited in the lower 3 panels of Fig. 6. However, the\nsituation is far more complicated, because the data is more\n\u201cburst-like\u201d than the electric field data and will inevitably\nbe broader band. Consequently, any strong short duration\nfeature will contribute to the 3 Hz spectral component. The\nclearest evidence for the 3 Hz artificial oscillations is seen in\nthe 32.3 eV channel. The 3 Hz amplitude is high in interval 2\nof the artificial event. There is also a strong 3 Hz component\nin the natural event prior to interval 1, as expected. The other\nTable 1.

However, there is\nalso evidence of an increase in 3 Hz power with increasing\nenergy for the artificial burst in interval 1. The origin of this\nrelationship for interval 1 is not yet clear.\nThe broadband (or otherwise) nature of the frequency\nspectra for the above events was also investigated. This was\ndone by examining more bins in the frequency spectrum. As\na result, it was found that the signals associated with the elec-\ntric field oscillations throughout intervals 1 and 2 (see Fig. 3),\ntogether with the downward fluxes during interval 2, were all\nessentially narrow band with a peak at 3 Hz. On the other\nhand, the downward flux burst seen in interval 1 was broader\nband, as might be expected from its shorter duration. The\nnatural wave signals detected by FAST prior to the intervals\n1 and 2 (for example, the burst of up-going and down-going\nelectrons at 20:16:17 UT, which shows no velocity disper-\nsion) tended to be broader band than artificial heating events.\nFinally, the time lags between the oscillations in the dif-\nferent energy channels have been estimated. This was done\nby taking the cross-correlations of sections of the filtered\ntime series. These are shown in Table 1. The lags ob-\ntained are similar to those found by Kolesnikova et al. (2002),\nwho reported the lags between different channels to each be\n\u223c0.05 s, by taking single peaks in the signal. A simple ide-\nalised way of interpreting this dispersion is to assume that\nthe acceleration region is localised at a single point at a fixed\ndistance above the spacecraft. A plot of the time lags as a\nfunction of the reciprocal of the particle velocities for the\nenergy channels involved should then give a straight line,\nwhose slope yields the distance from the acceleration. Fig-\nure 7 illustrates such a plot and indeed it provides a good\nstraight-line fit. However, as is clear, the straight-line fit is\nnot perfect, and a range of distances lie within the error bars\nof the data. The results are consistent with an acceleration\nregion location and spread of (3400 \u00b1 150) km altitude.\n4 Interpretation of the downward electron flux data\nAccording to ideal MHD theory, Alfve\u00b4nic ULF waves prop-\nagate along the field lines with negligible lateral dispersion;\nhence, the perpendicular electric field oscillations seen by\nFAST may be interpreted as the direct detection of the 3 Hz\nshear Alfve\u00b4n wave.

Peaks in the downward differential electron energy flux data from the FAST satellite (dashed least-squares regression lines) compare\nwell to the theoretical energy shift 1E that electrons would have after travelling through a region of localised parallel electric field (solid\ncolour lines) for a power law energy distribution. Panel (a) shows data points for each peak in the signal, with the log of the phase space\ndensity plotted against the log of the electron energy, with the associated least-squares regression line (dashed lines). Uncertainty in the base\nflux data points (black triangles), due to the signal noise amplitude, are shown as error bars on panel (a). Panels (b)\u2013(d) show the phase space\ndensity expected by shifting the power law particle distribution from the base level (black solid line) by the 1E displayed above each panel\n(solid coloured lines). Uncertainty in the peak phase space density data points (coloured diamonds), are shown on panels (b), (c), and (d) for\npeaks 1, 2 and 3, respectively.\nward electron flux energy channels require careful mod-\nelling, since their velocity dispersion suggests that the elec-\ntrons were not energised near the satellite but from a region\nhundreds of km above it. A magnetic field-aligned electric\nfield that causes an increase in velocity for downward pre-\ncipitating electrons can be obtained when electron inertia ef-\nfects are included in the ideal MHD theory for Alfve\u00b4n waves\n(Robinson, 2000). It is this parallel electric field that oscil-\nlates with the passing of the ULF wave, which can accel-\nerate the electrons from low energies to higher energy and\nless populated positions in the particle distribution. This is\nseen in the FAST electron flux data as amplitude increases\nand decreases at a frequency of 3 Hz as the Alfve\u00b4n wave cy-\ncle progresses. This process is illustrated schematically in\nFig. 1. However, the nature of the parallel electric field and\nthe resulting potential drop along the field line need to be\nconsidered. Kolesnikova et al. (2002) assumed an idealized\nexponentially increasing field-aligned electric potential with\naltitude, obtained by solving the differential equation for an\nAlfve\u00b4n wave propagating in an inhomogeneous plasma. The\nelectric potential \u03d5 is assumed to vary with altitude z above\naltitude z1 (altitude of FAST at 2550 km), and time t , accord-\ning to the expression\n\u03d5(z, t) = \u03d5(z1) exp\n(\nz\u2212 z1\nH\n)\ncos \u03c9t, (1)\nwhere H is the characteristic scale height of the plasma den-\nsity inhomogeneity (520 km), and \u03c9 is the angular frequency\nof the 3 Hz Alfve\u00b4n wave. \u03d5(z1), the potential amplitude at\naltitude z1, varies across the flux tube as the satellite passes\nthough the (approximately Gaussian-shaped) cross field dis-\ntributions in the upper IAR. This produces the different en-\nergy changes, as a function of time or horizontal position,\nobserved in the FAST electron flux data. The exponential\ngrowth holds up to an altitude of about 4000 km when the\nhot plasma population starts to dominate the density varia-\ntion with height. This forms the upper boundary of the IAR.\nThis picture is consistent with our result, as mentioned previ-\nously in Sect. 3, that the region where the majority of the ac-\nceleration effect occurs is effectively localised within a nar-\n1506 S. R. Cash et al.: Electron acceleration observed by the FAST satellite\nrow height range, with a width along the field line of about\n300 km. This is comparable to the scale length of the plasma\ndensity inhomogeneity in the exponential model. Thus, sig-\nnificant acceleration only occurs as electrons pass through\na region whose width is 300\u2013500 km at the upper boundary\nof the IAR. Since the particles observed by the FAST in-\nstruments have energies of 32 eV and above, the time taken\nto pass through this narrow region is much shorter than the\nwave period. This allows for a further simplification in that\nthe explicit time dependence in \u03d5 can be ignored for the short\ntransit period of the main acceleration region.\nThe interpretation of the differential electron energy flux\noscillations observed in the FAST data, in terms of this lo-\ncalized upward parallel electric field, will now be considered.\nThe basic idea is as follows. When downward moving elec-\ntrons pass through a quasi-static potential drop, the particle\nenergy distribution is shifted according to\nf (E)\u2192 f (E +1E), (2)\nwhere f (E) is the phase space density and 1E is the energy\ngained in crossing the potential drop across the acceleration\nregion. f (E) was obtained by dividing the DEF amplitude\nby the square of the channel central energy.\nKolesnikova et al. (2002) estimated the effect of the mod-\nulated parallel electric fields on the electron fluxes for the\nabove events by assuming the electron distribution at the\nacceleration height to be a drifting Maxwellian. These au-\nthors fitted the background flux levels for the lowest 2 energy\nchannels in the upward and downward electron fluxes to an\nisotropic Maxwellian with density 1.6 \u00b7 106 m\u22123 and tem-\nperature 18.5 eV. However, the Maxwellian distribution that\nKolesnikova et al. (2002) obtained using just 4 points from\nthe background flux levels does not yield consistent results\nfor the peaks in the flux data for all of the peaks in all of the\nelectron energy channels. In particular, it is found that the\namplitude of the flux oscillations in the lowest energy chan-\nnel are significantly higher than would be consistent with the\nMaxwellian distribution. In the present study, the electron\nenergy distribution was investigated by considering the base\nfluxes for all 6 upward and downward electron energy chan-\nnels available from FAST (12 data points used at multiple\npoints in the time series). This showed that a power law\nprovides a significantly better fit to the data. Furthermore,\nthe energy shift associated with the potential drops have a\nmuch greater effect on the fluxes in the lowest energy chan-\nnels than Maxwellians do, and it was found that the flux vari-\nations across all of the energy channels were well predicted\nby the power law distribution. Details of the power law fits\nare given below.\nIf the particle distribution follows a power law as\nf (E)\nf (E0)\n=\n(\nE\nE0\n)n\n, (3)\nwhere E0 is a constant, then the observed fluxes can be\nobtained by shifting the power law particle distribution by\n1E given in Eq. (2). Figure 8 illustrates how the power\nlaw particle distribution can be used to obtain a consistent\nfit to all of the peaks in all of the electron energy chan-\nnels. The peaks are denoted by numbers 1 to 3, going left\nto right in Fig. 3; the times for peaks 1, 2 and 3 are approx-\nimately 20:16:21:20, 20:16:21:60 and 20:16:21:90, respec-\ntively. Panel (a) of Fig. 8 is a log-log plot of the least-squares\nregression lines through the energy distribution functions of\nthe base and peak fluxes (peaks 1, 2 and 3 coloured green,\nyellow and red, respectively) as a function of electron chan-\nnel energy observed in the lowest 3 electron energy chan-\nnels. The base flux is the mean flux level in each channel\nat the time of the 3Hz oscillation. The value of n for the\nbase flux regression line gradient is \u20132.8. The y-error bars in\neach panel arise from estimates of the noise amplitude in the\nflux signals. Panel (b) shows the data points (triangles) for\nthe base flux downward, and the least-squares regression line\n(coloured black). The data points for peak 1 are shown in\ngreen diamonds, with a green dashed least-squares regres-\nsion line. The base flux energies were then increased by\nincrements in 1E until the constructed particle distribution\n(solid green line) most closely matched the data regression\nline (dotted green line) for peak 1. The same method was\nused to obtain 1E for peaks 2 and 3 shown in panels (c)\nand (d), respectively. The 1E values (see Eq. 2) obtained\nwere 11, 7.5 and 2.2 eV for peaks 1, 2 and 3, respectively,\nshown in Fig. 8. The 1E values vary across the flux tube\ntraversed by FAST in a manner which is consistent with a\nGaussian function of width \u223c10 km, with r-squared value of\n0.989. This is particularly encouraging because this validates\nthe theory outlined in Robinson et al. (2000) that the par-\nallel electric field distribution across the outgoing edge of\nthe heated flux tube is Gaussian-like. These potential drops\nacross the 300 km acceleration region indicate that the paral-\nlel electric field strengths were of the order of 10\u22122 mVm\u22121.\n5 Conclusion\nIn this paper the electric field and electron flux data from in-\nstruments on board the FAST satellite that captured an artifi-\ncial ULF wave injection event have been analysed. Spectral\nanalysis has shown that a coherent 3 Hz signature was de-\ntected in the above data time series, within a flux tube that\nmapped back to the artificial ionospheric source produced by\nthe Troms\u00f8 heater. The energy dispersed downward flux data\nwas also analysed in detail and was found to be consistent\nwith the existence of a localised region of oscillating paral-\nlel electric fields associated with the up-going artificial ULF\nwave. The acceleration region was located at around 850 km\nabove the spacecraft (at around 3400 km) and extended ap-\nproximately 300 km along the field line. This had the ef-\nfect of periodically accelerating the suprathermal electrons\ntowards the ionosphere. It was also found that the energy dis-\ntribution function that best fit the mean flux data and the os-\ncillating component was, in contrast to a previously assumed\nMaxwellian, a power law. The electric field amplitudes\nfound from fitting this simple model to the measured flux\nS. R.
