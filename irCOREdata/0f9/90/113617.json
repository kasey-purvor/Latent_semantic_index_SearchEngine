A\nconference held at the Tavistock Centre,\n17\u000118 October 2008\nReports from Katy Dearnley and Lydia Hartland-Rowe, compiled by\nLisa Miller\n\u2018From Baby to Boardroom\u2019 was the arresting title of a conference held at the\nTavistock Centre in October 2008. The idea for the gathering had evolved from\na discussion between two people investigating the application of the Esther Bick\nmethod of Infant Observation to organisations and consultancy, David\nArmstrong (UK) and Ross A. Lazar (Germany). While Bick\u2019s focus, as the\nprogramme acknowledged, was on the interplay between the child, its mother\nand its family, her \u2018method and conceptualisation\u2019 has \u2018influenced ways of\nframing and understanding the use and practice of observation in a much wider\nvariety of settings, including those afforded by institutional life\u2019. Keynote\nspeakers were Ross A. Lazar himself, Robert D. Hinshelwood (UK), Anton\nObholzer (UK) and Margot Waddell (UK).\nKaty Dearnley reports that Anton Obholzer began with a provocative\nfairytale about all the great psychoanalytic thinkers getting on famously and\ndeveloping a coherent view. He used this to illustrate the difficulty of cross-\nfertilisation, noting how long it took Bick to get other disciplines to consider\nInfant Observation. Then Margot Waddell gave a paper bringing the conference\nback to the centrality of the transference, with the idea that preconceptions block\nobservation being a key theme. Katy Dearnley also tells us that Robert\nHinshelwood \u2018gave fascinating examples of the unconscious at work in\norganisations and drew attention to the complexities of relationships and group\nprocesses in organisations which are different from Infant Observation\u2019.\nA variety of international presenters offered workshop opportunities for\ndiscussion, and one of these presentations, \u2018An exploration of \u2018\u2018quality of life\u2019\u2019 in\nISSN 1369-8036 print\/ISSN 1745-8943\n# 2009 Tavistock Clinic Foundation\nDOI: 10.1080\/13698030902764957\nhttp:\/\/www.informaworld.com\nInfant Observation\nVol. 12, No. 1, April 2009, 117\u0001127\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n8:4\n7 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \nnursing homes\u2019 is published in the present issue of this Journal. Online observers\nwere present, and Lydia Hartland-Rowe writes a contribution for us from the\npoint of view of one of them.\nAn observer observing observers: a review by a \u2018virtual delegate\u2019\nThe recent conference held at the Tavistock and Portman Clinic NHS Trust,\n\u2018From baby to boardroom\u2019, focused on the relevance and usefulness of both the\npractice of Infant Observation and on an observational stance in understanding\nhuman activity. A pilot attempt by the Tavistock at providing \u2018virtual\u2019\nconference membership through relaying the conference live online meant\nthat for the first time a limited number of \u2018online delegates\u2019 had access to the\nconference from a distance, via the Internet.\nAs one of these \u2018virtual\u2019 delegates, my experience was both rich and\nfrustrating. There was the obvious attraction of being able to have access to\nsome of the content of the conference, and there was something particularly\nappealing about the idea that a conference about Infant Observation, in which\nthe observation of organisations would be a central theme, would itself be\nobserved, and I would find myself an observer.\nAs with all observers, my view of the conference was inevitably a partial one; I\nwas never properly a member of the conference family or organisation, but was\nstill allowed to watch it at work. Some of the proceedings of the conference\nremained off-limits to the online observer, as only the main papers were\nrelayed*but similarly, as an observer rather than a conference member, I could\nswitch off or take myself away more easily than those committed to the event\nwith their physical presence.\nThe virtual community connected to the event had its own group life. The\nconference organisers had ensured that, once logged on to the event, online\ndelegates had access to the full programme and to the delegate list. There was\nalso a list of online delegates which included a precise account of the amount of\ntime each delegate had spent logged on; a strangely intimate detailing of one\u2019s\nattentiveness or propensity for woolgathering, both of which tend to remain a\nmore private matter at a conference attended in the real rather than virtual world!\nThe possibility of moving in and out of contact with a conference is of course\none of the attractions of online access in a world where time to invest properly in\nfull attendance at such an event is hard-won. It is, of course, also one of the main\ndisadvantages, because it means that the understanding and impact of the event\nis too quickly made partial and disjointed, and it is also simply too easy not to\nstay involved with what might be more difficult or less appealing. It is much\neasier to start doing the ironing or even just gazing out of the window in a\n118 News and Events\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n8:4\n7 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \nsituation where there are no witnesses beyond one\u2019s own superego than it is to\ndrift off or march out of a paper that bores, irritates or disturbs one too much.\nWhat the experience lacked, for all it offered, was a sense of the containment\nthat a live group event can provide, as much as such an event can also provoke. It\nwas too easy to hear only what there was time for (in my case, only one main\npaper and one plenary discussion) perhaps intensified by the feeling that online\ndelegates were already partly excluded by not having access to the parallel papers.\nBoth Robert Hinshelwood\u2019s paper and the lunchtime plenary discussion on\nthe second day of the conference certainly gave a sense of the themes that were\nbeing discussed: the meaning of the role of observer in organisational settings;\nthe distinctions, hard to define, between observer and consultant; the purpose of\nobservation as a training model or a mode of intervention in organisational\nsettings. Perhaps there was also an undercurrent of uncertainty or disagreement\nabout where the practice of observing organisations had come from, and to\nwhom it \u2018belonged\u2019. One of the effects of being outside of the group looking in\nwas that some of the group discussions about the nature of the conference itself,\nand to which institutions it did or didn\u2019t belong, seemed much less important or\ninteresting than they might have had I been physically present. At these\nmoments the group seemed to be rather preoccupied with itself, and it is hard to\nknow whether distance gave perspective and made this helpfully visible (in the\nway of some aspects of observation), or whether absence meant a lack of contact\nwith a live and meaningful emotional event. I understood from colleagues who\nhad attended the conference in person that the whole question of the \u2018virtual\ndelegates\u2019 was the subject of much discussion and the source of not a little\npersecutory anxiety*ironically, I missed all this because of being a virtual\ndelegate.\nThere is no doubt that online streaming of conferences is an important and\ncreative way to ease access to these kinds of events, especially where geography\nmight make the difference between being able to attend in person or not. As with\nall families or organisations who take the brave step of allowing an observer to\njoin their lives, however partially, attention needs to be paid, by both observer\nand observed, to the risks and benefits of this involvement. If a contract has been\nmade to include virtual delegates, then they need to be made as welcome as\npossible given the inevitably partial nature of the connection, and this was largely\ndone very well for this conference. On the part of the virtual delegate, perhaps\nthere is a responsibility to know the limits of one\u2019s participation in the event, and\nto hold on to the awareness, as one does as an observer, that what is seen is\ninevitably only a snapshot of family or organisational life, and not to expect\nmore.\nInfant Observation 119\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n8:4\n7 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \n"}
