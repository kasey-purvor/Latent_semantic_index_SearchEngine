Meanwhile, the need for more edu-\ncation and training, especially in relation to symp-\ntom control, communication and caring for patients\nwith nonmalignant conditions remains a continuing\ntheme in the primary care literature (Boyd, 1995;\nRobbins, 1998; Seamark and Thorne, 1993). Yet,\neducational programmes have often met with\nlimited GP support (Grande, 1997; Shipman et al.,\n2001b), possibly due to lack of awareness of gaps\nin their own training. That said, recent studies\n(Barclay et al., 1999; Boyd, 1995; Field, 1998;\nRobbins, 1998) suggest that primary healthcare\nteam members regard palliative care as a high pri-\nority and recognise their frontline position in being\nthe most likely source of support and help for\npeople with palliative care needs.

This\npaper presents some of the \u008e ndings from the \u008e rst\nphase of an evaluation of one such GP facilitator\nscheme in the Welsh county of Powys and takes\nthe perspective of the GP facilitator post-holders.\nWe describe the origins of the model of facilitator\nintervention, as well as that adopted in Powys, and\nthen explore the perceptions and expectations of\npost-holders during the \u008e rst year of the facilitator\nscheme, based upon data gathered from qualitative\ninterviews conducted on three separate occasions.\nThe development and evaluation of GP\nfacilitator schemes in the UK\nThe impetus for the establishment of cancer and\npalliative care facilitator schemes in the early\n1990s grew from a realization by Macmillan and\nthe RCGP that community-based palliative care\nplaces considerable demands upon general prac-\ntitioners and other members of the primary\nhealthcare team in meeting the needs of this parti-\ncular client group (Cox et al., 1995). Little was\nknown of the involvement of general practitioners\nin the management of the dying patient, yet it was\nrecognized that with a signi\u008e cant number of people\ndying at home, general practitioners and their\nteams must regularly be in contact with such\npatients (RCGP and CRMF, 1995). At the time, it\nwas unclear whether general practitioners were\nable to provide an effective and high quality palli-\native care service in the community (Blyth, 1990;\nCartwright, 1990). Consequently, initial work,\nunder the auspices of the RCGP, considered a\nmodel of facilitation for improving care by the use\nof facilitators to provide advice and support in a\ncontext where general practitioners share the\nexpertise developed within their own \u008e eld to\naddress these issues.\nSubsequently, a rolling programme of GP palli-\native and cancer care facilitator appointments has\nbeen developed with the following aim:\nTo enhance the continuity and quality of\ncancer and palliative care in the community\nby providing experienced general prac-\ntitioners to work as educational facilitators\nPrimary Health Care Research and Development 2003; 4: 177\u2013186\nwith primary health care teams to help mobil-\nise, enhance and develop existing pro-\nfessional skills.\nThere are currently around 60 Macmillan facilit-\nators in post (Thomas and Millar, 2001) in which\nthe charity works in partnership with a local \u2018host\u2019\norganization which adds its own distinctive aims\nto local projects. However, with a few notable\nexceptions (Cox et al., 1995; Munday et al., 1999;\nShipman et al., 2001a), evaluations of such\nschemes have been sparse in both number and\ncritical orientation.\nDeveloping a model of facilitation for\nPowys\nThree problems were thought to exist when con-\nsidering the development of a suitable model of\ncancer and palliative care facilitator intervention in\nPowys. First, local GPs held varying perspectives\non how the role of facilitator might be oper-\nationalized in practice. Second, GPs were either\nunable or unwilling to give \u2018protected\u2019 time to the\nfacilitation role. Third, many GPs were uncertain\nabout how additional money from Macmillan\ncould usefully be spent, given that GPs were\nalready providing palliative care to patients in their\nown homes and in local community hospitals. For\nthese reasons, the standard model of GP facili-\ntation, whereby GPs implement educational inter-\nventions in other practices was dismissed as\nunworkable and undesirable in the Powys context.\nThe \u008e rst appointments to the facilitator role in\nPowys were made in February 1999 and by June\n1999, 12 facilitators had taken up post. Employed\nfor one session per week, these facilitators are\ntaking part in a 3-year intervention project which\nhas the following aims:\n\u00b7 To provide extended clinical care (see Box 1)\nin palliative care to both cancer and noncancer\npatients by agreement of all doctors in practices\nin the designated areas;\n\u00b7 To provide an educational intervention to raise\nthe standards of generalist palliative care in\npractices in the designated areas;\n\u00b7 To work with the health authority to ensure a\nco-ordinated and integrated framework for the\ncommissioning and provision of specialist\ncancer and palliative care for the county.\nEvaluation of a Macmillan GP clinical facilitator project 179\nWe undertook an evaluation of this scheme,\ncommissioned by Macmillan Cancer Relief, in\npartnership with Powys Health Care NHS Trust,\nproceeding in two phases. Phase 1 of the evalu-\nation (1999\u20132000) would be essentially explora-\ntory in nature and focus on the experiences, percep-\ntions and activities of the GP facilitators. Phase 2\n(2000\u20132002) would then focus on measuring the\neffectiveness and impact of the facilitator inter-\nvention. In this paper, we present \u008e ndings from\nphase 1 of the evaluation.\nLocal context\nPowys is the largest of the Welsh counties, as well\nas the most sparsely populated and its general prac-\ntices often cover wide geographical areas. It is\nmade up of several independent communities with\nsigni\u008e cant distances between them. It has neither\na district general hospital within its boundaries, nor\ndesignated specialist palliative care beds, though\nthere are some designated GP palliative care beds.\nConsiderable use is therefore made of the 10 com-\nmunity hospitals and the majority of patients\nrequiring inpatient palliative care remain under the\ncare of their GPs. All of the Powys general prac-\ntices make use of community hospital beds. Cancer\ndeaths in Powys average 361 per annum, compared\nwith average annual deaths from all causes in\nPowys (1995\u20131997) of 1404 (Department of Public\nHealth, Dyfed Powys Health Authority, 1999).\nMethod and sample\nPrevious experience (Billings, 2000; Ingleton\net al., 1998; Pawson and Tilley, 1997) in con-\nducting evaluation studies of new service develop-\nments has revealed the dif\u008e culties which can\narise: low up-take of the service in the early\nstages; initial setbacks and \u2018teething\u2019 problems;\nanxieties among those being \u2018evaluated\u2019; and\nchanges to initial project aims. Accordingly, the\nevaluation team (comprising expertise in the\nsocial sciences, nursing and medicine) adopted a\nparticipatory and consultative mode of working,\ndesigned to both minimize disruption and press-\nure on those involved and to place a strong\nemphasis upon appropriate feedback and dis-\nsemination of \u008e ndings.\nPrimary Health Care Research and Development 2003; 4: 177\u2013186\nA range of data collection methods was used,\ntaking into account the perspectives of a full range\nof stakeholders, and drawing upon a variety of data\nsources. The methods employed for phase 1 of the\nstudy are set out in Box 2. This paper draws upon\nthe data from interviews with facilitators. Data\nrelated to other aspects of the study are reported\nelsewhere (Noble et al., 2001).\nBox 1 Categorisation of palliative care\nservices and settings\nCharacteristics and care setting\nLevel 1 The use of palliative care prin-\nciples or an \u2018approach\u2019 which may\nbe discerned within general prac-\ntitioner services or within long-\nterm institutions, such as nursing\nhomes.\nLevel 2 The presence of trained and\naccredited specialist practitioners\nwho use their skills to provide\nextended clinical care in a range of\nnonspecialist settings.\nLevel 3 A high concentration of trained\nstaff with access to a range of spe-\ncialized expertise and in which ser-\nvices are provided either at home\nor in a specialist setting.\nSource: Clark and Seymour (1999)\nThe sample comprised all GP facilitators\nappointed to the project across Powys (n = 12).\nThere are 18 general practices and 10 community\nhospitals in Powys. Facilitators were initially\nappointed to eight practices, linked to eight of the\n10 community hospitals. Six of the facilitators\nwere female and six were male, and two facilitators\nheld a university diploma in palliative care.\nInterviews were semistructured and were carried\nout at the start of the evaluation, approximately 6\nmonths later, and at the conclusion of the \u008e rst year\nof the project. An aide-memoire was used to guide\n180 Christine Ingleton et al.\ninterviews, focussing broadly on four main\nsections (see Box 3).\nBox 2 Data collection methods employed\nin phase 1 of the evaluation\nDiary records completed by clinical facilit-\nators\nSemistructured interviews with (at three\npoints during phase 1) GP clinical facilitators\nSemistructured interviews with specialist\nproviders in Powys and beyond\nDocumentary analysis (including demo-\ngraphic and epidemiological records)\nPostal questionnaire survey of all general\npractitioners and district nurses, and a pur-\nposive sample of community hospital Staff\nBox 3 Topics areas covered in interviews\nwith facilitators\n(1) Interest in palliative care, expectations\nand perceptions of the facilitator role\nand how it could be developed\n(2) Relationships with nonspecialist and\nspecialist providers of palliative care\n(3) Main barriers to delivering palliative\ncare in Powys\n(4) SWOT analysis (strengths, weaknesses,\nopportunities and threats) of the facilit-\nator project\nQuestions in the preliminary interview were the\nsame for all participants but in subsequent\ninterviews the focus and content was guided by\ninformation from diary material, as well as com-\nments made in previous interviews.\nAll initial interviews (12) and the majority of\nthe second interviews (10) were carried out face-\nPrimary Health Care Research and Development 2003; 4: 177\u2013186\nto-face. A few of the second interviews (two) and\nall of the third interviews were conducted by tele-\nphone to reduce the amount of travelling required\non the part of the researchers, and to allow greater\n\u008f exibility for both parties in choosing time and\nplace. Several studies (Bariball et al., 1996;\nSibbald et al., 1994) have demonstrated that tele-\nphone interviewing has particular bene\u008e ts when\nthe sample is geographically spread, or when\nworking within a continually changing environ-\nment, as was the case in this study. Two inter-\nviewers (CI and PH) carried out the interviews,\nwhich typically lasted between 30 and 40 min. All\ninterviews were tape-recorded with consent using\nhigh quality, specialized recording equipment. The\nuse of this type of equipment was a necessary pre-\nrequisite to conducting successful interviews via\nthe telephone.\nAnalysis of data\nAll interview data were fully transcribed and two\nresearchers (CI and PH) read all transcriptions.\nData were open coded (Strauss and Corbin, 1990),\nthat is, data were broken down into discrete parts,\nclosely re-examined and compared for similarities\nand differences. This process achieved a series of\ncategories and themes and these were written and\ndiscussed with members of the research team and\ncon\u008e rmed by examination of transcript excerpts.\nEach piece of data that related to a theme was\n\u2018lifted\u2019 from the interview transcripts and regular\nmeetings were held to con\u008e rm coding decisions,\ncompare analyses and agree on conclusions.\nFindings from this analysis were presented to\nparticipants, not only as a \u2018check on validity\u2019, but\nas a means of collecting additional data, stimulat-\ning further analysis, involving participants in the\nevaluation, and stimulating action on \u008e ndings\nand recommendations.\nFindings\nFour major themes emerged from the analysis:\n\u00b7 Starting out\n\u00b7 Role boundaries\nEvaluation of a Macmillan GP clinical facilitator project 181\n\u00b7 Gaining and maintaining credibility\n\u00b7 Quantity versus quality.\nStarting out\nThere was considerable enthusiasm among all\nfacilitators at the start of the project, with \u2018excit-\ning\u2019 a frequently used descriptor. The project\u2019s\nstrengths were perceived as two-fold. First, it was\nan opportunity both to focus attention on palliative\ncare issues within general practice locally and to\ndevelop a model of service provision which could\nhave relevance outside Powys. Second, it was\nperceived as a possible route for facilitators\u2019 own\nprofessional clinical development, which might, in\nturn, offer the potential for improvement in care\nand better communication between GPs. The\nfollowing excerpt encapsulates the views of most\nof the post-holders:\nStrengths, I mean you know it\u2019s enormously\nexciting, but there are all sorts of potential\nstrengths of it, its going to raise awareness,\nits going to I think raise standards. I think\nit\u2019s going to improve communication among\nGPs which is quite important here and at the\nend of the day be very good for the GPs and\nthe patients really % (8\/1)\nWhilst there was widespread acknowledgement\nof the potential value of the role, this was tempered\nby some degree of apprehension about the magni-\ntude of the task, matched by a concern over the\namount of time which could be allocated to it:\nIt\u2019s at the stage of having opened that door\nand looking through and being aware of the\nhuge subject of palliative care locally \u2026 and\nof course \u008e nding the time \u2026 (1\/1)\nThis group of GPs were self-selected for the posts,\nall (except one) by means of noncompetitive\ninterviews. This was seen as being of signi\u008e cance\nand, in some instances, crucial to the success of\nthe project:\nI think that the strength of the project is that\nit\u2019s using people who are already in post and\nwho in many ways are self selected because\nthey want to live in a rural area which poss-\nibly has greater responsibility, challenges\nbecause of the distances from the DGH. So\nI think that, the GPs are, are of a good calibre\nto begin with. So I think that\u2019s one of its\nmain strengths. (3\/1)\nPrimary Health Care Research and Development 2003; 4: 177\u2013186\nOne post holder put it more emphatically:\nIt often stands or falls on the quality of the\nfacilitator you\u2019ve got (4\/1)\nThere was a range of reasons for interest in the\nclinical facilitator posts. Post-holders felt they and\ntheir colleagues generally, regarded palliative care\nas an integral and satisfying part of their practice.\nAs one facilitator explained:\nIt\u2019s been a kind of interest in the practice,\nand we\u2019ve all done \u2013 we all become involved\nin palliative care, I think the vast majority of\npatients with cancer choose to die at home in\nthis area, and it\u2019s \u2013 it is something that can\nusually be achieved, because families are\nvery supportive on the whole and they have\nthe \u2013 the community hospital as well to pro-\nvide backup \u2026 (1\/1)\nAlthough work with dying patients was seen as\nimportant and rewarding it was not usually seen as\nbeing particularly different from the rest of a\ngeneral practitioner\u2019s work. Similarly, palliative\ncare was often spoken of as a concern and\nresponsibility of all GPs in the practices, though\nthere were also instances where existing structures\nwithin a practice might lend themselves to one\npartner developing a particular \u2018clinical niche\u2019 in\npalliative care \u2013 this could occur for example in\ngroup practices where special interests were\nalready evident. A facilitator in one such practice\nexplained:\nI thought \u2018right, for the practice this would\nbe good, not just for us personally, but for\nthe whole area and we, the partners within\nthe practice have different specialties, two of\nthem are general surgeons, two are anaesthe-\ntists, so it was felt there was an area lacking,\nand we can help the others like they\u2019re\nhelping us with our other problems \u2026 (2\/1)\nRole boundaries\nFacilitators were asked about their relationships\nwith members of the primary healthcare team.\nThey pointed out that the different circumstances\nof general practice in Powys required an alternative\nmodel from that adopted for facilitators in England.\nGPs in Powys had often chosen to work there\nbecause of the independence required of them, the\nopportunity for an extended role, particularly in the\n182 Christine Ingleton et al.\ncommunity hospitals, and the possibilities for\ncontinued care of patients through many stages of\ntheir lives:\nSpeaking for the partners they\u2019re afraid that\nwe are gonna take over their terminally ill\npatients; and after all some have been GPs\nfor 30 odd years and don\u2019t want that, they\nwant to look after them to the end; and we\nkeep saying well we won\u2019t be taking them\nover, we\u2019ll be there in an advisory role only\nif you want us \u2026 (6\/2)\nSuch GPs, it was suggested, were likely to be self-\nreliant, to have considerable experience in looking\nafter patients with palliative care needs and their fam-\nilies, and to have a commitment to close involvement\nwith their care, often continuing to visit personally\ntowards the end of a patient\u2019s life, rather than \u2018hand-\ning over\u2019 to colleagues. Moreover, such care was\nseen as embedded in family and community relation-\nships because of a rural context in which GPs were\nlikely to have built up a relationship prior to the onset\nof their terminal illness.\nContact with partners in connection with the fac-\nilitator project was seen by some post-holders as a\ndelicate area, with a concern not to be heavy-\nhanded in the approach to colleagues already\nexperienced in delivering palliative care:\nThe partners are all very experienced and\nhave been doing palliative care for longer\nthan myself \u2026 I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve got a very\nmajor problem \u2026 they\u2019re not afraid of using\nmorphine, for example, \u2026 but the other thing\nis, maybe we should have more of an interest\nin their patients. I think at the beginning X\nand I thought that \u2026 let\u2019s not interfere with\nwhat other people are doing with their\npatients, because it\u2019s a bit intimidating to\nthem, however I think now in order to \u008e nd\nout exactly what they are doing, maybe we\nshould be looking at the notes, or perhaps\ndiscussing more with the nurses \u2026 (9\/3)\nMoreover, facilitators were keenly aware that\nnot holding a recognized quali\u008e cation in palliative\ncare could leave them in a vulnerable position:\nI think one of the weaknesses at the start was\nthat the GPs are all at different levels, those\nwho\u2019ve got a diploma already have a much\nclearer understanding of the way things\nPrimary Health Care Research and Development 2003; 4: 177\u2013186\nshould be taken forward. Those who haven\u2019t\nclearly, have to get themselves up to speed.\n(4\/3)\nThis situation was a signi\u008e cant issue in the\nPowys scheme where facilitators could feel vulner-\nable and somewhat exposed when carrying out\ntheir educative role with other members of their\npeer group:\n\u2026 I think the problem is trying to educate\nour partners when really speaking we haven\u2019t\nhad any more education in palliative care\n(than they have). (10\/2)\nAll facilitators were clear that they did not wish\nto adopt an \u2018expert\u2019 or specialist role but did recog-\nnize the paradoxical pressures from other stake-\nholders who had expectations that post-holders\nwould act as a resource for advice and information,\nrelieving some of the pressures on specialist pro-\nviders.\nSometimes attempts to involve partners did not\nyield much success and nine months into the project,\nthis remained an unresolved issue for some post-hold-\ners. Facilitators were therefore thinking carefully\nabout what approach they might adopt next:\nI\u2019ve got nowhere at all with the medical staff\n\u2026 within the practice \u2026 I haven\u2019t really\nexplored very much why the other partners\naren\u2019t interested, although I\u2019ve a good idea\nwhy they\u2019re not interested; they just feel basi-\ncally that they\u2019ve got other things going \u2026\nI think they rather feel that me taking on this\nis \u2026 me becoming a palliative care specialist\n\u2026 (5\/3)\nSuch remarks illustrate some of the dif\u008e culties that\nnewly established facilitators face in gaining credi-\nbility and legitimacy in the eyes of established\nsystems of care where territorial boundaries may\nbe jealously guarded. Although the establishment\nof a new role was not intended to supersede exist-\ning provision, it does by de\u008e nition suggest some\ninadequacies within it. For this reason, careful\nconsideration was given to how best to approach\nGP colleagues, with some facilitators using one of\nthe project tasks (setting up a cancer register) as a\nmeans of chipping away at traditional role\nboundaries:\nthis [the cancer register] is a useful way of\ninteracting with my colleagues without feel-\nEvaluation of a Macmillan GP clinical facilitator project 183\ning that I\u2019m taking any of their clinical\nresponsibilities. (2\/2)\nGaining and maintaining credibility\nMaintaining credibility among their GP partners\nwas especially important and central to the \u2018suc-\ncess\u2019 or otherwise of the facilitators\u2019 work on the\nproject: without this they could not hope to in\u008f u-\nence the culture, direction or implementation of\nevidence-based palliative care. The completion of\na university diploma in palliative care was viewed\nas an important means to gaining such credibility.\nAll facilitators expressed high levels of commit-\nment to continuing professional education. Yet,\nbalancing the competing demands of their every-\nday work-load with those of undertaking study for\na diploma in palliative care sometimes resulted in\na sense of overload. Information relating to all\naspects of palliative care was readily available\n(often because of involvement in the facilitator\nproject), but perhaps in quantities greater than\ncould easily be absorbed, requiring some selection\nto make this information manageable. A particular\nconcern for a number of facilitators was the\nmechanism for enhancing and improving their own\npalliative care skills, and the standards against\nwhich the care could then be measured:\nwe\u2019ve got to be sure that our knowledge is\nsuf\u008e cient. One way of course is by doing this\ndiploma course. The other thing I would like\nto do \u2026 is to go to Holme Towers (inpatient\nhospice out of county) \u2026 and maybe have\ntwo or three study days \u2026 if we had more\ncontact \u2026 we\u2019d have a better idea of what\nwas expected by today\u2019s standards. (11\/1)\nThis close clinical contact of the so-called \u2018sitting\nwith Nellie\u2019 type of clinical teaching was an inte-\ngral part of learning about contemporary practice\nfor many of the post-holders. Similarly, informal\nand \u2018unplanned\u2019 discussions with specialist col-\nleagues based around patient referrals were the pre-\nferred method of acquiring up-to-date knowledge.\nMost facilitators valued this as an opportunity for\ntwo-way learning. It may, however, be less popular\nwith specialists chie\u008f y because it is so time-\nconsuming.\nQuantity versus quality\nA theme emerging from all the interviews con-\ncerned the complex balance between the quality\nPrimary Health Care Research and Development 2003; 4: 177\u2013186\nand quantity dimensions of the facilitator role, in\nother words, the perceived dif\u008e culties associated\nwith ful\u008e lling the role in a context where time is\nlimited and priorities were often competing. On the\nquantity side, several facilitators identi\u008e ed work-\nload variations:\nIt\u2019s bursts of activity \u2026 nothing seems to be\nhappening for a while, and every now and\nthen it\u2019s palliative care \u2026 let\u2019s get on with\nit. (8\/2)\nI got to a point when I wonder if I am doing\nanything, but things over the last two or three\nweeks have hotted up \u2026 (4\/2)\nThe reasons for these feelings of \u2018not doing\nenough\u2019 varied, although there was consensus that\nfacilitators were rarely able to set aside a regular\ndesignated session each week for their Macmillan\nwork, so their activities were necessarily intermit-\ntent. Allied to this, work of facilitators involves\nopportunistic networking and developing the con-\nsultative and educational aspects of the role with\nother professionals. This is somewhat atypical in\nthe context of general practice, where work is usu-\nally much more planned and tangible. Neverthe-\nless, we found that the level of activity recorded\nin the diaries completed by facilitators appeared to\nindicate a commitment over and above the normal\none session per week, although precise quanti\u008e -\ncation of these data was not possible due to in-\ncomplete records.\nMoreover, it should be borne in mind that this\nstudy took place against a backdrop of unparalleled\nchange as primary care entered yet another un-\ncertain phase of far reaching reorganization. This\nmeant further demands upon time, as GPs were\nexpected to take on an increasingly wide range of\ntasks. The start of the facilitator project coincided\nwith the impact of New Labour reforms to health\nservices in Wales, in the context of a devolved\nregional assembly. These included the abolition of\nfund-holding and the introduction of local health\ncare groups (LHCGs) in Wales. Each of these\ngroups operates at four levels of complexity, from\nan advisory role in health authority commissioning\nto commissioning care for their population on the\nbasis of a public health function for the locality\n(Barclay et al., 1999). Unlike the groups in\nEngland, those in Wales have no budgetary\ncontrol, at least initially. General practitioners are\n184 Christine Ingleton et al.\nrequired to run the boards of primary care groups,\nin conjunction with nurses and other primary care\nstaff (Oldham and Rutter, 1999). A key feature is\nthe concept of clinical governance, which, for the\n\u008e rst time, requires explicit clinical standards\nincluding clinical audit, use of evidence-based\npractice and processes to pick up and address\nunderperformance (Lipman, 2000). Further, the\nformation of these groups has added responsibility\nfor commissioning services to the GPs\u2019 role as\nservice provider and gatekeeper of secondary care.\nOne facilitator recognised the magnitude and rami-\n\u008e cations of these changes and summarized the\nissue clearly:\nThreats to the project possibly time con-\nstraints, and with the re-organisation of gen-\neral practice and the formation of a local\nhealth group, and the amount of commitment\nthat will involve, that\u2019s a threat on the way\ngeneral practice will be working and the\nwhole pressures we\u2019ll be put under, person-\nally I\u2019d much rather be involved with the\npalliative care project than all the re-\narrangement, but there\u2019s no way of avoiding\nsome commitment to the local health care\ngroup \u2026 the changes are coming and they\nwill have a massive impact on the whole way\ngeneral practice is seen and functions \u2026\n(12\/1)\nWhilst there were reservations about work-load\nand time constraints, there were no such worries\nconcerning the quality of palliative care offered,\nalthough it was acknowledged that there were\nalways areas which could be improved:\nthere is perhaps a feeling I could do better,\nthere\u2019s always been, and you read about it\nand you hear about it, the feeling because of\nthat sense of failure that you should be curing\npeople \u2026 (2\/3)\nCommunity hospitals were seen as having a cen-\ntral role in the delivery of good quality palliative\ncare. Some facilitators described the community\nhospitals as more comparable with care at home\nthan with care in acute hospitals, although it should\nbe noted that community hospitals within the\nregion vary considerably in terms of bed numbers\nand the range of treatments and services available.\nThe hospitals were seen as an extension of primary\ncare insofar as they enable GPs and primary\nPrimary Health Care Research and Development 2003; 4: 177\u2013186\nhealthcare teams to support people within their\nown communities and provide intermediate care:\nIt\u2019s [community hospital] an extension of\ntheir home and it is part of the community\nso kids pop in and out on their way to school\nand it\u2019s, I mean it\u2019s enviable because it, it\nworks. (4\/2)\nRural communities were spoken of as tending to\nbe self-reliant, so people are more likely to put up\nwith symptoms for longer without seeking advice.\nCommunity hospitals were therefore very signi\u008e -\ncant in the provision of in-patient care, and the role\nof the GP was considered different from most other\nareas in the UK because of their responsibilities\nfor community hospital beds. The decision, then,\nto reduce the number of beds in the community\nhospital of Powys from 415 to 289 (Powys Health\nCare NHS Trust, 1999) was viewed by many GPs\nas a retrograde step and one which could poten-\ntially have a major impact on care provision in\nthe future:\nFor our patients it would be devastating \u2026\nfor example, needing respite would have to\ntry and get them in a hospice, there\u2019s a wait-\ning list, they\u2019d just have to go to the district\ngeneral hospital. (1\/3)\nDiscussion\nFor most facilitators, the overarching concern was\nto carve a \u2018niche\u2019 that would complement and aug-\nment rather than supplant any existing provision.\nIt was acknowledged that this could be a slow and\nincremental process and one that would require\ncareful negotiation, trust building and a \u2018light\ntouch\u2019 before new post-holders were able to fully\nintegrate their work within an established network\nof providers.\nThis study also underlines a fundamental, yet\nfrequently overlooked premise that any role is\ninvariably a re\u008f ection of the individual assuming\nthe direction, scope and responsibilities of that\nrole. Dombeck (1997) describes this phenomenon\nin terms of \u2018professional personhood\u2019. In other\nwords, the individual is de\u008e ned by a capacity for\ncognition and communication, possession of\nknowledge and skills, emotional and experiential\ncapabilities, as well as by membership of a pro-\nfessional group. In these terms, the establishment\nEvaluation of a Macmillan GP clinical facilitator project 185\nof a group of GPs with an interest in and commit-\nment to improving palliative care provision is a\nmajor strength of the project. This commitment is\ndemonstrated in their self-selection to the project\nand in their motivation to undertake continuing\nprofessional development. The personal strengths\nof the individual post-holders in terms of their\n\u008f exibility and willingness and ability to work in a\nmultidisciplinary way were also crucial to the\nsuccess of the project.\nIt should be noted that this study took place\nagainst a backcloth of huge change in the organis-\nation of general practice as a whole. In the light of\ncontinued reorganizations, attempts are being made\nto de\u008e ne the nature of \u2018general practice\u2019 and its\n\u2018core values\u2019 have themselves become contentious\nissues (Kumar, 2000). On the one hand, there is\nresistance to relinquishing the ideal of GPs as\nautonomous providers of integrated, and generalist\nmedical care; while on the other there a desire to\ndevelop the more recent role as providers of\nincreasingly specialized care. The GPs in this study\nappeared to view the changing landscape as an\nopportunity for developing and extending inter-\nmediate skills within general practice and forging\nlinks with other providers of primary and second-\nary care (c.f. Kendrick and Hilton, 1997).\nThere are two enduring strengths of general\npractice. The \u008e rst is the continuous longitudinal\nrelationship with patients and family members\nwhich produces \u2018personal knowledge\u2019 that may\nenable the general practitioner to match appropri-\nate services to the particular needs of the client\ngroup. The second is the particular expertise of the\nGP whose clinical skills, it could be argued, are\nadapted to the undifferentiated nature of clinical\nproblems presented in primary care in the context\nof a \u2018low technology\u2019 setting (Fugeli and Heath,\n1996). For many of the facilitators we interviewed,\nthe community hospital was viewed as one of the\nvehicles for affording opportunity to provide this\nlocally accessible, longitudinal and integrated care.\nCommunity hospitals have an important role in the\nprovision of palliative care and have been shown\nto deliver very good standards of care (Seamark\net al., 2001). Yet at a time when community hospi-\ntals are being expanded in the UK, Powys, where\nthe present study was conducted, is reducing the\nnumber of available beds, albeit on a more limited\nbasis than \u008e rst believed. Nevertheless there\nremains a concern that the planned bed closures\nPrimary Health Care Research and Development 2003; 4: 177\u2013186\nwill place an increasing burden on an already over-\nstretched service. Crisis admissions during busy\nwinter months and the paucity of nursing home\nbeds in Powys may further add to the concerns.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the picture that emerges from the\n\u008e rst year of this facilitator project is broadly a posi-\ntive one. The very existence of palliative care facil-\nitator in the region brings the issue of palliative\ncare into the spotlight. Facilitators have tailored\ntheir roles to \u008e t in with and augment the practices\nwith which they deal. Their attitudes vary, but their\ngoals of facilitation and education appear similar.\nPost-holders regard palliative care as an integral\nand satisfying part of their practice and the project\nwas viewed as an opportunity to raise the pro\u008e le\nof palliative care both locally and nationally. The\nfocus from the outset has been on the importance\nof shaping the \u2018intervention\u2019 in a variety of ways,\naccording to local need, and in a rapidly changing\ncontext where the magnitude of that change rep-\nresents a major challenge to all involved in primary\ncare. This \u008f exible approach appears to be enabling\nfacilitators to adapt readily to changing situations,\nwhilst also allowing greater scope for other col-\nleagues to exercise their own autonomous expertise\nand judgement. However, the main challenge\nfacing post-holders is that of being aware of the\npossible existence of professional rivalries, whilst\nhaving to develop their role in ways that do not\nencroach upon the territories of long-established\ncolleagues. This has to be reconciled with the poss-\nible paradoxical tensions from other stakeholders\nin the initiative who have expectations that facilita-\ntors will act as a resource and thus relieve some\nof the pressures on specialist providers. These\nissues will need constant attention if post-holders\nin the Powys project are to become effective\n\u2018facilitators\u2019 of palliative care in their local\ncommunities.\nAcknowledgements\nThe study was commissioned and funded by\nMacmillan Cancer Relief.
