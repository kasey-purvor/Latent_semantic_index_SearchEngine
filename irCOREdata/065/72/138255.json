Introduction\nWhen considering what leaders really do, Kotter (1990) observed that management is about\ncoping with complexity. Good management brings a degree of order and consistency to key\ndimensions like quality and profitability of products. Management, according to Kotter (1990), is\nenacted through an organisation\u2019s formal structure. Greenleaf (1977: 59) comments that an\norganisation\u2019s formal structure consists of more or less definite arrangements and ways of working\nthat are spelled out in statutes and rules or established practices. These take care of routine\noperations, specifying lines of reporting and authority for certain actions and expenditure, and\noutline steps to be taken in certain anticipated circumstances. Morgan (1997: 11) analogises the\nformal structure of the organisation as a machine.\nIn contrast to management, Kotter (1990) considered leadership to be more about coping\nwith change. When contemplating the structure of organisations Greenleaf (1977: 59) identified two\nmain parts, formal and informal, concluding that the informal structure responds more to leadership.\nKnowles (2002: 97) analogised organisations informal structures as a living system, observing that\npeople in them tend to self organise around the work, forming patterns and networks.\nLeadership research may be broadly characterised by the continued development and testing\nof generalisable theoretical frameworks to explain the effects of pre-existing executive and senior\nmanagement team characteristics on an organisation\u2019s performance (Gupta & Govindarajan, 1984;\nEisenhardt & Schoonhoven, 1990; Miller, 1991; Wiersema & Bantel, 1992). Some researchers\nfocus on the use of historical documentation when establishing a link between characteristics and\nperformance (Finkelstein & Hambrick, 1990; Hambrick et al, 1996) whist others have used quasi-\nexperimental methods to link characteristics and performance (Boon et al, 1998; Carpenter &\nGolden, 1997). Few studies have considered organisational outcomes in terms of psychological\ninfluences, however Miller et al (1982) and Boone & De Bradander (1996) have considered\nA Role Based Perspective on Leadership as a Network of Relationships, As Sent to Print\nPage 4 of 37\nexecutive\u2019s locus of control and Kets de Vries & Miller (1984) have contemplated executives\nneuroses.\nA further branch of leadership research has been that of identifying relationships between the\ncharacteristics of executives and the effectiveness of the organisation, while at the same time being\ncriticised (Boal & Hooijberg, 2001; Cannella & Monroe, 1997) for its positivist form. Positivism\nassumes that the researcher is a sort of \u201cspectator\u201d of the object of enquiry (Chia, 2002; 7). Reality\nis assumed to unproblematically exist \u201cout there\u201d independent of the perceptions, beliefs and biases\nof the researcher. For positivists, sound research consists of the \u201cundistorted\u201d recording of\nobservations obtained through efficiency driven methods of investigation and the use of precise\nterminologies and classification in the process of documentation (Kakabadse & Kakabadse, 2005).\nExplanations regarding the observed pattern of regularities connecting one set of phenomena with\nanother can then be systematically developed and empirically verified.\nThe research described in this article addresses the question of the extent to which a role\nbased perspective can provide insight into the distributed and networked form of leadership. The\napproach adopted focuses on the creation of shared meaning amongst those executives participating,\nand from this creation of new knowledge. In so doing the author\u2019s intent is to explain how the roles\navailable to executives whilst discharging their leadership responsibilities are related. To address\nthis question the authors adopted a collaborative inquiry approach (Heron, 1981; Kakabadse &\nKakabadse, 2005), in contrast to a positivist approach. Collaborative inquiry focuses on creation of\nshared meaning amongst co-inquirers via the co-creation of group knowledge, and as a consequence\nof new knowledge, change through learning, and in so doing helps to explain how characteristics of\nexecutives are related.\nA Role Based Perspective on Leadership as a Network of Relationships, As Sent to Print\nPage 5 of 37\nIn this article the authors first examine the literature on leadership that supports a distributed\nand networked perspective. A methodology section that explains and justifies the data gathering\nstrategy follows. The theoretical model that emerges from the gathered data is then described. The\nmodel highlights practical steps individual executives can take to identify and develop the groups of\nwhich they are a part. Mapping networks of relationships within informal and temporary groups\nwas found to facilitate improvement in each executive\u2019s ability to discharge their leadership\nresponsibilities within the wider formal senior management team. The article concludes with a\nconsideration of the implications for both leadership theory and the practicing executive.\nA Role Based Perspective on Leadership as a Network of Relationships, As Sent to Print\nPage 6 of 37\n2. A Network Based Perspective on Leadership\nThe notion that leadership can exist in a distributed form may seem to be at odds with the\ndefinitions of leadership most commonly accepted. Many definitions of leadership (Rost, 1993)\nimply that leadership is a disproportionate social influence process. From this perspective, there is\nno leadership without leaders \u2013 that is individuals who exert more influence on the group then others\ndo. When influence is equally shared amongst members of a group and there are no individuals who\nexert disproportionate influence, the group is leaderless and therefore we cannot talk about\nleadership. It has been argued by Shamir (1999) that the term leadership should be reserved for\ncases in which a single individual or small group of individuals exerts disproportionate influence on\na larger group.\nOther researchers view leadership in terms of functions that are important for the survival of\nthe group and the accomplishment of its goals. From this perspective leadership may be performed\nby a single individual, two individuals, divided amongst group members or performed by the entire\ngroup (Avolio et al, 1996; Bowers & Seashore, 1966; Manz & Sims, 1993; Pearce & Sims, 2000).\nVarious leadership functions may be carried out by different people who influence what the group\ndoes, how it is done, and the way people in the group relate to each other (Yukl, 1998: 3). The\ndistribution of leadership amongst group members promotes participative decision making (Vroom\n& Jago, 1988). Important decisions about what to do and how to do it were observed by Yukl\n(1998) to be made in groups through the use of an interactive process that involves many different\npeople who influence each other. Leadership in this context is a reciprocal process amongst group\nmembers (Yukl, 1998). This perspective is supported by Northouse\u2019s (2004) observation that\nleadership is a process, and secondly that leadership is not a linear, one-way event but rather an\ninteractive event.\nA Role Based Perspective on Leadership as a Network of Relationships, As Sent to Print\nPage 7 of 37\nThe origin of a distributed perspective on leadership can be found in the changing nature of\nwork. The rise of the knowledge worker was observed by Drucker (1959) to be both a symptom and\ncause of changing patterns of organisational structure and leadership. For Drucker (1995), the shift\nfrom mostly manual labour performing repetitive tasks to educated workers applying theoretical and\nanalytical knowledge is the process of putting knowledge to work. This Drucker (1995) concluded\nhas had a profound impact on philosophies of leadership and the structure of organisations. When\nconsidering the implications of the shift to knowledge based working, Hooker & Csikszentmihalyi\n(2003) concluded that more work within organisations would become flexible and varied. This in\nturn will require teamwork of a new kind, one that is conducive to the expression of creativity and\ninnovation. Hooker & Csikszentmihalyi (2003) specifically considered the implication for the\nleadership organisations will increasingly require, concluding that decentralised forms of leadership\nwill become more necessary and so will shared forms of leadership.\nThe shift in the conceptualisation of leadership from a single person to a team model requires\nnew concepts and methods to capture the nature and structure of leadership. Yukl (1998: 459) states\nthat:\nViewing leadership in terms of reciprocal, recursive influence processes among multiple parties\nin a systems context is very different from studying unidirectional effects of a single leader on\nsubordinates, and new research methods may be needed to describe and analyse the complex\nnature of leadership processes in social systems.\nThe social network approach is one perspective that Mayo et al (2003) considered might help\nprovide the conceptual framework and methodological tools. The most distinguishing feature of a\nsocial network perspective is its emphasis on relationships amongst social actors and the patterns\nand implications of these relationships (Wasserman & Faust, 1994). Cartwright & Harary (1977)\noutlined the basic idea of representing groups as a collection of points connected by lines. The\nA Role Based Perspective on Leadership as a Network of Relationships, As Sent to Print\nPage 8 of 37\nresulting \u201csociogram\u201d represents the network of relationships amongst group members that can be\nanalysed.\nThe link or tie is the basic building block of a social network. As observed by Mayo et al\n(2003) a link is not the property of any single individual; rather it is a relational entity that exists\nonly if two individuals are connected together. Some common ties examined in the literature are\ncommunication networks (Danowski, 1980), friendship and instrumental relations (Ibarra &\nAndrews, 1993), and help and advice relations (Krackhardt & Porter, 1986). A task network\ndevelops around work-role performance and is directly associated with the prescribed objectives of\nthe task (Mayo et al, 2003). A friendship network is defined as organisational members\u2019 exchanging\npersonal information and developing close friendships (Ibarra & Andrews, 1993). An advice\nnetwork develops as individuals seek advice from others in the network; it serves to identify the\nexperts in a social system (Krackhardt & Porter, 1986). A conclusion of Mayo et al (2003) is that\nsocial influence is at the core of the leadership process.\nA Role Based Perspective on Leadership as a Network of Relationships, As Sent to Print\nPage 9 of 37\n3. Leadership Roles\nThe theoretical roots of role making were reviewed by Seers et al (2003: 82) who observed\nthat over decades of research the basic process of role differentiation has been documented. With\nrespect to leadership, Bass\u2019s (1949) analysis noted that two individual group members often\nemerged into complementary roles. One of these leaders was generally the member most respected\nfor his contributions to the accomplishment of tasks within the group. The other was generally the\nbest-liked member, who was most respected for his contribution and support of friendly interaction\namongst members. Similar results were reported by Carter (1954), Slater (1955), Borgatta & Blaes\n(1956), Bales & Slater (1955) and Bales (1958).\nThe above early studies are focused on role differentiation, however it is important to note\nthat not all of these studies consistently showed the same emergence of two high-status leadership\nroles and resulting follower roles for the remaining group members. Bales & Slater (1955) found\nthat member roles were also differentiated by member activity, with Slater (1955) observing that the\ndegree of group consensus in the identification of the status hierarchy was related to the pattern of\nrole differentiation. The strongest consensus was generally achieved when the two most active\nindividuals emerged into the task specialist and relationship specialist roles. Consensus was lowest\nwhen the most active member did not score highly in either task or relationship dimensions,\nindicating that group level conflict reduced when active group members emerged into a distinct\nleadership role.\nA theoretical framework for organisational role theory was developed by Katz & Kahn\n(1966, 1978) that is particularly useful for providing insight into the task functions of groups and\ntheir members simultaneously with the psychological and social facets of group behaviour. Katz &\nKahn (1978) considered roles to constitute patterns of behaviour established by interaction of\nmembers of a social unit. These roles allow individuals to know both what others expect of them\nA Role Based Perspective on Leadership as a Network of Relationships, As Sent to Print\nPage 10 of 37\nand what to expect from others. Roles evolve over time as group members exchange interactions\nand thus construct meaningful relationships. An important implication of roles for the members of a\ngroup is that members know what they will need to do and how interdependent others will react. As\nobserved by Sarbin & Allen (1968) this results in less communication being required for the\ncoordination of activity resulting in fewer misunderstandings, less wasted effort and associated\npsychological tensions. As such, time may be used more effectively, and therefore the group is able\nto accomplish its task more rapidly.\nMoreland & Levine (1984) studied the role making process within groups, concluding that\nwhen role-making takes place in a newly formed group, it simultaneously constitutes the group\ndevelopment process. As members come to conform to their role expectations, those expectations\nshared in common amongst members become the norms of the group. As observed by Festinger\n(1950) and Weick (1979), acting together these norms consensually validate the group\u2019s social\nreality. A group that is generally successful in gaining productive contributions from its members\nthrough effective roles and positive norms will be better placed to achieve organisational goals.\nFrom this perspective the group owes not only its identity to how its members perceive it, but also\nthe entirety of its performance.\nIn terms of discrete roles Sheard & Kakabadse (2002) developed a perspective on leadership\nusing an ethnographic methodology whereby the roles of leaders were defined in terms of four\ndistinct categories legitimate, social, task and macro. Sheard & Kakabadse (2002) concluded that it\nwas entirely possible for every individual within a group to occupy one of the four leadership roles.\nFurther, the ability of individual executives to adopt complementary leadership roles to other group\nmembers was closely correlated to their own individual effectiveness as a leader.\nA Role Based Perspective on Leadership as a Network of Relationships, As Sent to Print\nPage 11 of 37\nThe legitimate leader was defined by Sheard & Kakabadse (2002) as the publicly appointed\nleader of the group who is accountable for delivery of the team\u2019s objectives. The social leader was\ndefined as the individual who undertakes to build a network of relationships with other group\nmembers. Sheard & Kakabadse (2002) regarded task leaders as deriving their legitimacy to lead\nother group members from the formal allocation of responsibility for delivering a specific task by\nthe group\u2019s legitimate leader. The macro leadership role was defined as the leadership role played\nby a senior executive when interacting with the group. The senior executive brings a \u201cmacro\u201d view\nof the organisation to the group, and whilst Sheard & Kakabadse (2002) observed that the time the\norganisation\u2019s senior executives spent interacting with any one group was relatively small, the\nimpact that this had on the group was found to be great.\nThe research of Sheard & Kakabadse (2002) was primarily concerned with the identification\nof leadership issues associated with the creation of high performing task orientated project teams.\nSheard & Kakabadse (2002) identified five \u201ccritical points\u201d in the development of individuals\nmeeting for the first time into a high performing task orientated project team. At each of the five\ncritical points, the relative importance of the four leadership roles was characterised, highlighting\nthe changing nature of the leadership required as a group develops.\nA Role Based Perspective on Leadership as a Network of Relationships, As Sent to Print\nPage 12 of 37\n4. Methodology\nIn the inquiry that is the subject of this article, the authors studied the extent to which a role-\nbased perspective can provide insight into the distributed and networked form of leadership. To\nexamine this issue the authors selected a number of individuals who were used for the basis of the\ninquiry. The individuals were drawn from the senior management teams of three organisations of\nsimilar demographic profiles, utilising a collaborative inquiry methodology.\nThe term \u201ccollaborative inquiry\u201d refers to a form of qualitative research which, broadly,\nresults from an involvement by the researcher with members of an organisation over a matter that is\nof genuine concern to them and in which there is an intent by the organisation\u2019s members to take\naction based on the intervention. Qualitative research tends to emphasise individual\u2019s\ninterpretations of their environment and of their own and other\u2019s behaviour. Sensitivity to what\npeople say and to the context in which their actions take place is a primary consideration of\ncollaborative inquiry.\nCollaborative inquiry as a research methodology was first proposed by Heron (1981) who\nargued that traditional social science inquiry methods were neither adequate nor appropriate for the\nstudy of persons who are, in themselves, self determining. Collaborative inquiry starts with the\nassumption that people \u201care the authors of their own actions \u2013 to some degree actually and to a\ngreater degree potentially\u201d (Heron, 1981: 84). Reality is understood through experiential knowledge\nthat is gained through participation with others. Understanding emerges through four modes of\nknowledge:\n(1) Propositional; theoretical ideas about things.\n(2) Practical; action related knowledge.\n(3) Experiential; as actually experienced.\n(4) Presentational; images, stories, dreams or some form of creative output.\nA Role Based Perspective on Leadership as a Network of Relationships, As Sent to Print\nPage 13 of 37\nThe generation of knowledge is based on Heorn\u2019s (1981) cycle of enquiry, Figure One.\nPropositional knowledge was considered by Reason (1994: 326) to be \u201crouted in and derived from\nthe experience and practical knowledge of the subject of inquiry\u201d. An individual\u2019s experience and\npractical knowledge has implications for practice, as it is this that constitutes individual\u2019s skills,\ncompetences and capabilities to confront and propose solutions to the issues they face. Through the\ncontinued application of skills, competences and capabilities, experiential knowledge is gained\nabout the nature of contact with people and events (Heron, 1981).\nAs new knowledge is created, by the nature of the collaborative inquiry process it is tacit.\nThe transfer of tacit knowledge requires time and effort to surface and share experiential knowledge\nthrough democratically conducted dialogue, which is often of a dialectic nature (Guba, 1990).\nDialectic disclosure unearths assumptions leading to intellectual discovery and new presentational\nknowledge. The new presentational knowledge emerges through the distillation of individual\nexperience and its representation in concepts and assumed attitudes and behaviours. The overall aim\nis to construct a context within which \u201cknowledge is developed and put to use, while results, which\nwould have been traditionally characterised as applied, fuel further theoretical advances\u201d (Gibbons\net al, 1994:19).\nTake in Figure One\nThe collaborative inquiry process aims to produce knowledge and action directly useful to\ngroups, and to empower people to examine and construct models that meaningfully utilise their own\nknowledge. The scientific merits of collaborative inquiry have, however, been a contentious issue.\nThe seminal work of Susman & Evered (1978: 589) addresses the issue of validity within qualitative\nresearch, of which collaborative inquiry is one branch. For Susman & Evered (1978) action based\nA Role Based Perspective on Leadership as a Network of Relationships, As Sent to Print\nPage 14 of 37\nresearch is \u201ccorrective to the deficiencies of positive science\u201d. Some researchers have argued that\nvalidity is a tool of the positivists, and not applicable to qualitative research (Watling cited in Simco\n& Warin, 1997), and that understanding is more important then validity. Validity in collaborative\ninquiry is built into the inquiry process through the inquiry cycle of action and reflection and as such\nis of a consensual nature that is achieved through (Heron, 1988; Reason, 1994):\n\uf0b7 Congruence of propositional, practical, experiential and presentational\nknowledge.\n\uf0b7 Iterative inquiry cycles of action and reflection.\n\uf0b7 Participants\u2019 capacity to build, test and enact their propositions.\n\uf0b7 Enactment of outcomes or intra-group validation.\nA Role Based Perspective on Leadership as a Network of Relationships, As Sent to Print\nPage 15 of 37\n5. Theory Building Through CI\nEach collaborative inquiry cycle of learning consists of propositional knowledge, practical\nknowledge, experiential knowledge and presentational knowledge. In particular, propositional\nknowledge can be derived from a tacit understanding of context such as assumed social structure\nand observation of participant\u2019s behaviour. Similarly, practical knowledge is gleaned from\nobservable inquirer\u2019s actions. Experiential knowledge, however, involves greater complexity.\nInterpretation of events, and how those participating in the collaborative inquiry, the inquirers,\nevolved their frame of implementation, forms the substance of this knowledge mode (Berger &\nLuckmann, 1966). At the completion of each cycle, new presentational knowledge constitutes the\ngeneration of a deeper level of insight into the nature of the social structure in which inquirers are\nembedded, and consequently a higher level of understanding (Kakabadse & Kakabadse, 2005).\nEach cycle of learning as inquirers journeyed through the four stages from propositional to\npresentational knowledge was represented by the documentation of deliberations experienced as the\ninquirers collaborated in writing a summary report. Record keeping serves multiple purposes,\nparticularly tracking that the viewpoints of inquirers are fairly represented and logged, and the\ndegree to which inquirers demonstrate growth evidenced by each person\u2019s awareness of the\nalterative views raised through the inquiry process. The inquirers collaborated during the report\nwriting process, drawing on different sources of data from each of the four collaborative inquiry\nstages, Table One.\nTake in Table One.\nEach summary was structured around three sections. Firstly, a description of the theory\ncomprising the propositional knowledge. Secondly, a description of the new presentational\nknowledge. Thirdly, implications of the new knowledge for both leadership theory and practice.\nA Role Based Perspective on Leadership as a Network of Relationships, As Sent to Print\nPage 16 of 37\nThe summary document always closed with the inquirers agreeing on the main points, nature of the\nemergent ideas and areas for further deliberation. An example extract from the summary document\nproduced after the fifth collaborative inquiry cycle, Table Two, provides an insight into the applied\nnature of the conclusions reached during the early cycles of the collaborative inquiry process. It\nbecame practice for the inquirers to begin each new learning cycle with a discussion of the main\nconclusions and learning points from the previous cycle\u2019s summary document, and implications of\nthe emergent theory for action during the next learning cycle.\nTake in Table Two.\nThe inquirers produced a new summary document every one to three months. Over a five-\nyear period (the beginning of 2000 to the end of 2004) twenty-six summary documents were\nproduced, averaging approximately one every two and a half months. The extended time scale of\nthe collaborative inquiry resulted in inquirers joining, contributing and leaving the collaborative\ninquiry group. Membership of the collaborative inquiry group always included the authors, and\nbetween four and six other inquirers. The other inquirers would typically join as a consequence of a\nspecific organisational issue that the collaborative inquiry group was addressing and then leave\nwhen that specific issue was resolved. With the exception of the authors who were involved\ncontinuously four five years, no other inquirer was involved for more then two years, with the\naverage being closer to eighteen months.\nMembership of the collaborative inquiry group was stable as each organisational issue was\naddressed, and then would change as an issue was resolved and the group moved onto a new issue.\nEach collaborative inquiry group was, however, a relatively small sub-set of the managers who were\ninvolved in resolving a particular issue. The managers involved in the larger group changed over\nA Role Based Perspective on Leadership as a Network of Relationships, As Sent to Print\nPage 17 of 37\ntime, resulting in each collaborative inquiry group working with a shifting population of managers.\nA shifting population assisted the collaborative inquiry process, as each collaborative inquiry group\nhad a regularly changing population of managers with whom new theory could be tested. Each new\ngroup of managers would receive a slightly different version of theory developed by the\ncollaborative inquiry group. Early attempts to involve those outside a collaborative inquiry group in\ntheory development were unsuccessful, and therefore a shifting population of managers was found\nto be essential to provide a new audience for theory developed as a consequence of experience with\na previous group of managers.\nParticipation in the collaborative inquiry group was on a voluntary basis. Early attempts to\nencourage those who were less predisposed to the role of inquirer were unsuccessful, with the\nindividuals concerned leaving the collaborative inquiry group typically after only one meeting. By\nmaking participation voluntary, the authors found that group members were more likely to engage\nwhen adopting a spirit of openness enabling them to listen to others points of view and to question\ntheir own frame of reference in a non-defensive manner. The authors concluded that actualising\nsharing is a much more demanding task then was envisaged prior to establishing the collaborative\ninquiry group. Through such insights cycle five was a turning point for the collaborative inquiry\ngroup as the inquirers developed the confidence to formalise the theory developed to date in the\nform of a training course for the wider organisation\u2019s senior and middle management. The theory\ndeveloped by cycle five related to group development, and the action those in leadership roles could\ntake to ensure that individuals meeting for the first time transformed into a high performing team in\nthe minimum of time.\nThe training course itself was a tangible output of the collaborative inquiry process, however\nit was not the only benefit to the organisation and its managers. A feature of any theory is that it\nA Role Based Perspective on Leadership as a Network of Relationships, As Sent to Print\nPage 18 of 37\ntends to draw attention away from those factors that are not included within the theory. The training\ncourse focused on the need to adopt a small-group approach to solving organisational problems,\nutilising goal planning to define each small group\u2019s tasks and how they inter-linked to deliver an\noverall solution to the problem being addressed. The training course offered theoretical insights into\nthe best way to ensure that small groups transformed into high performing teams in the minimum of\ntime. Whist it would not be true to say that efficient organisation of group work was the\norganisation\u2019s only problem, it was an endemic issue that seriously undermined ability to deliver\nnew product development programs on time, budget and to specification. The collaborative inquiry\ngroup estimated that research and development productivity, for example, increased by 30% within\na year of rolling out the training course across the organisation.\nSuccess of the training course gave the inquirers confidence in the value of their work and\nconsequentially they became progressively more reflexive and to more readily share experiences.\nAs a consequence cycles six to ten were completed in only nine months, with cycle ten constituting\na turning point with emergent theory again being formalised by the inquirers. The theory developed\nat cycle ten was documented by Sheard & Kakabadse (2002), describing the changing relative\nimportance of four leadership roles as a group of individuals meeting for the first time transforms\ninto a high performing team.\nThe capturing of new knowledge at cycle five and ten constituted the collaborative inquiry\ngroup transforming knowledge from tacit (experiential) to explicit (presentational) knowledge. Each\ninquirer gradually developed the social-cognitive skills to deal with the transition of knowledge\ntransformation. Furthermore, once each inquirer gained confidence in themselves and the process of\ninquiry, they started to think beyond the immediate confines of the group. This was evident by\ncycle fifteen, with the inquirers constructing a synopsis of the contribution of theory generated\nA Role Based Perspective on Leadership as a Network of Relationships, As Sent to Print\nPage 19 of 37\nduring cycles one to five and cycles six to ten, and implications of the theory for the practicing\nexecutive elucidated during cycles eleven to fifteen. The group disseminated fifty copies of the\nsynopsis through the organisation\u2019s senior management team, with the Human Relations director\nchampioning the dissemination process.\nThe synopsis was well received, confirming the value of the collaborative inquiry process\nitself. The inquirers recognised that whilst the theory development process was of little interest to\nthose outside the collaborative inquiry group, the theory resulting from the development process was\nregarded as both relevant and useful to the organisation by the senior managers to whom the\nsynopsis was distributed. The inquirers recognised that it was not necessary to explain in detail the\nprocess by which they had reached a theoretical position. It was enough, for example, to simply\npresent goal planning and methods for effective small-group working as the solution to the problem\nof low research and development productivity. That these insights had been created as a\nconsequence of a collaborative inquiry process was a matter of supreme indifference to the majority\nof those managers involved. It appeared to be enough that managers had been involved, and that\nthose to whom they reported were enthusiastic and positive about the inquirer\u2019s output.\nDissemination of a synopsis was a high point for the inquirers, which they entered with\nenthusiasm and motivation. The inquirers gathered feedback from those to whom the synopsis had\nbeen circulated, and then participated in brain storming sessions in order to identify aspects of the\ntheory in need of further development. An area that emerged from the brain storming sessions as\nimportant was the linkage between action executives could take and the development of a supportive\ngroup social structure within those groups of which they were a part. A further eleven cycles\nhowever (cycles sixteen to twenty-six) were needed before emergent theory would again be\nformalised.\nA Role Based Perspective on Leadership as a Network of Relationships, As Sent to Print\nPage 20 of 37\nAfter the first of these cycles (cycle sixteen) the inquirers identified a need to characterise\nthe four leadership roles further if they were to gain greater insight into the linkage between\nexecutive action and development of a group social system. The approach adopted during cycle\nseventeen to characterising the four leadership roles was for inquirers to identify approximately one\nhundred separate groups responsible for the mobilisation of organisational resources. The relational\nties between group members were then identified. The process used to identify relational ties was to\nlook for evidence that two group members were engaging in dialogue for the duration of the time a\ngroup was addressing the issue that had prompted its formation. The inquirers then discussed the\nresulting sociograms, and the leadership role that most closely matched group member\u2019s actions\nassigned to each group member.\nThe next three cycles (cycle eighteen, nineteen and twenty) were associated with progressive\nattempts to provide structure to the sociograms that had been generated. During cycle eighteen the\ninquirers reviewed the sociograms, concluding that those ascribed social or task leadership roles\nwere predominately associated with activity internal to the group. This was in contrast to those\nascribed legitimate or macro leadership roles that were predominantly associated with the gathering\nof data from other groups, the communication of the groups intended action to other groups and the\nreceiving of feedback regarding the consequence of such action if carried out. The output of cycle\neighteen was, therefore, consideration of leadership roles in terms of intra and inter-group processes.\nDuring cycle nineteen the inquirers refined the sociograms, eliminating those individuals\nfrom them who could be considered to be members of other groups, with whom those in legitimate\nand macro leadership roles were conducting inter-group exchanges. The resulting sociograms\ncontained fewer individuals, but still many relational ties with no obvious pattern emerging at a\nA Role Based Perspective on Leadership as a Network of Relationships, As Sent to Print\nPage 21 of 37\ndetail level. At a general level, however, the inquirers agreed that the relational ties associated with\nthose occupying social or legitimate leadership roles were primarily associated with relationship\nbuilding within the group. In contrast those occupying macro or task leadership roles built relational\nties more closely associated with goal attainment within the group. The output of cycle nineteen\nwas, therefore, consideration of leadership roles in terms of relationship building and goal\nattainment.\nTaken together cycle eighteen and nineteen facilitated creation of a distributed model of\nleadership, Figure Two. The four leadership roles are modelled in terms of their goal attainment and\nrelationship building plus intra and inter-group orientation. The model may be considered to be a\ndistributed model of leadership as the four leadership roles were conceptualised by Sheard &\nKakabadse (2002) as collectively embodying every aspect of leadership required of those who\npresume to step into leadership.\nTake in Figure Two\nCycle twenty continued the process of adding structure to the sociograms by identifying the\nmost important relational ties between those occupying each leadership role. The process of\ndefining leadership roles in terms of relationship building and goal attainment enabled the inquirers\nto contemplate relational ties between individuals occupying different leadership roles in terms of\nrelationship building and goal attainment. Specifically the inquirers identified networks amongst\ngroup members that could be considered to be associated with friendship, advice and task\naccomplishment.\nA Role Based Perspective on Leadership as a Network of Relationships, As Sent to Print\nPage 22 of 37\nWhen inquirers focused on those relational ties between groups members associated with the\ngroup\u2019s task accomplishment network, each leadership role was discovered to be associated with\nonly one or two task related relational ties. Specifically, the individual occupying the task\nleadership roles was characteristically associated with a relational tie to the individual occupying the\nsocial leadership role. When contemplating the social leadership role, relational ties to those\noccupying task and legitimate leadership roles were identified. Those occupying legitimate\nleadership roles had characteristic relational ties to those occupying social and macro leadership\nroles. Lastly, those occupying macro leadership roles had characteristic relational ties with those\noccupying legitimate leadership roles, Figure Three.\nTake in Figure Three.\nDuring cycle twenty-one the inquirers reviewed their sociograms, considering each in turn\nand contemplated the appropriateness of relational ties between individuals occupying each\nleadership role identified as part of the group\u2019s task accomplishment network. It was with mounting\nexcitement that the inquirers realised that whilst advice and friendship networks varied randomly\nfrom one sociogram to another, the task accomplishment relational ties between leadership role\nholders appeared to be generically applicable to all sociograms. The exact form of the task\naccomplishment network varied from one sociogram to another as the number of task leaders linking\nto a social leader varied between one and seven and the number of social leaders linking to a\nlegitimate leader varied between one and three. This gave a theoretical lower limit of four, and\nupper limit of twenty six group members. In practice the smallest sociogram contained five\nindividuals (one macro, one legitimate, one social and two task leaders) and the largest nineteen\nindividuals (one macro, one legitimate, one social with three task, one social with four task and\nlastly, one social with seven task leaders.\nA Role Based Perspective on Leadership as a Network of Relationships, As Sent to Print\nPage 23 of 37\nThe authors recognised that by defining the leadership roles to which each leadership role\ncould link when forming a task accomplishment network, a mechanism had been created that\nenabled a generic task accomplishment network to form within a group, without being prescriptive\nas to how many individuals would comprise the group or what leadership role any specific\nindividual must adopt. As such relatively complex task accomplishment networks could emerge in\nlarger groups whist each individual within the group followed simple guide lines as to their primary\nrelational ties given the leadership role they were contemplating adopting.\nCycles twenty-two and twenty-three were associated with progressively more focused effort\non the part of inquirers to encourage group members to adopt one of the four leadership roles (cycle\ntwenty-two) and to form relational ties with the those occupying other leadership roles of primary\nimportance to the group\u2019s task accomplishment network (cycle twenty-three). The authors observed\nthat in larger groups where more then seven task leaders were attempting to establish relational ties\nto one social leader, invariably a new social leader would emerge from amongst the task leaders\nenabling both the task and the group to be split such that no social leader was maintaining relational\nties with more then seven task leaders. Within the sociograms, only one occurrence of a social\nleader sustaining relational ties with seven task leaders was observed. Over ninety percent of social\nleaders established relational ties with two, three or four task leaders.\nCycles twenty-four and twenty-five were associated with progressively more assertive effort\non the part of inquirers to define the action needed from each group member in terms of the goal\nattainment and relationship building orientation appropriate to the leadership roles group members\nwere occupying at the time; and secondly the intra and inter-group orientation of each leadership\nrole.\nA Role Based Perspective on Leadership as a Network of Relationships, As Sent to Print\nPage 24 of 37\nBy the twenty-sixth cycle, group members were able to associate themselves and others with\nappropriate leadership roles and pro-actively initiate dialogue with those other leadership role\nholders associated with the group\u2019s task accomplishment network. Further, group members were\naware of the goal attainment and relationship building plus intra and inter-group orientation of each\nrole, and were able to conceive the action required of them in such terms. The group associated with\ncycle twenty-six was characterised by gaining rapid productive contributions from its members plus\nlow individual and group level conflict. The inquirers considered the time taken for the group\nassociated with cycle twenty-six to complete its task, estimating that this had been achieved in\napproximately twenty percent of the time that would have been considered typical during cycles one\nto ten.\nA Role Based Perspective on Leadership as a Network of Relationships, As Sent to Print\nPage 25 of 37\n6. Networked Leadership \u2013 A Framework\nThe last eleven cycles of the collaborative inquiry process were characterised by the authors\u2019\ninvolvement in informal and temporary group discussions with inquirers and other group members\nas they contemplated the networked and distributed nature of the leadership required of them. By\nthe end of cycle nineteen, definition of leadership roles in terms of goal attainment and relationship\nbuilding plus intra and inter-group processes facilitated development of a distributed model of\nleadership. Leadership is distributed as the tasks of leadership are distributed amongst all members\nof a group. Each group member occupies one of four leadership roles, with each leadership role\nbeing defined in terms of its goal attainment and relationship building plus intra and inter-group\norientation. Further, definition of leadership roles in terms of intra and inter-group processes helped\nto define the boundary around groups clarifying who was indeed a part of any given group, and who\nwas actually part of a different group with whom inter-group exchanges needed to take place.\nMany of those outside the collaborative inquiry group regarded leadership exclusively in\nterms of activity associated with task accomplishment. The introduction of a social dimension into\nthe distributed model of leadership helped to raise awareness of the need for social networking. The\nmanagers involved had little explicit vocabulary for the social arena, and did not feel comfortable\ndiscussing social aspects of their role as managers explicitly. The distributed leadership model\u2019s\ninclusion of a social dimension effectively transformed discussion of social aspects of role, with\nwhich managers were not comfortable, into a more general discussion about leadership, with which\nthey were.\nThe conceptualisation of leadership in terms of goal attainment and relationship building\nenabled the relationships observed between group members to be contemplated in such terms. By\ncycle twenty the concept of a characteristic and generic task accomplishment network had emerged,\ndefined by specific task orientated relational ties between each leadership role holder and the\nA Role Based Perspective on Leadership as a Network of Relationships, As Sent to Print\nPage 26 of 37\nremaining group members occupying other leadership roles. The existence of specific task\naccomplishment relational ties between group members could be used to identify a task\naccomplishment network within a group\u2019s overall network of relationships.\nMoreland & Levine (1984) studied the role making process within groups, concluding that\nwhen role making takes place in a newly formed group, it simultaneously constitutes the group\ndevelopment process. The adoption of leadership roles by group members and crystallisation of a\ntask accomplishment network within the group may be considered to be a role making process that\ncan be contemplated in terms of group development. When meeting for the first time, group\nmembers would be no more then a collection of individuals, Figure 4a. Over time each individual\nwould develop relational ties with other group members who they liked personally (friendship\nnetworks) and whose opinion they respected (advice networks), Figure 4b.\nAs the group developed an embryonic social system, group members learnt to adopt one of\nthe four available leadership roles. This phase in the group development was marked by agreement\nbetween group members that the group contained the right individuals to occupy the leadership\nroles, with new members joining, and others leaving to be considered members of different groups\nwith whom inter-group exchanges needed to take place. This development phase could be\nconsidered complete when group members agreed each had adopted a leadership role appropriate to\nthe needs of the group, given the specific goal the group was tasked with achieving, Figure 4c.\nThe final phase in the group development was marked by crystallisation of a task\naccomplishment network. Emergence of the task relational ties as dominant amongst group\nmembers corresponded with the group first gaining productive contributions from its members,\nFigure 4d. Whilst the task accomplishment network is embedded in a constellation of relationships\nA Role Based Perspective on Leadership as a Network of Relationships, As Sent to Print\nPage 27 of 37\nwithin the group (Figure 4d), if examined it becomes apparent that it is has the same form as a\ngeneric task accomplishment network (illustrated in Figure 3) based on the defined relational ties\nassociated with each leadership role.\nTake in Figure Four.\nAmongst the first to chart a group\u2019s development was Tuckman (1965) who identified four\nstages in the development of a group, forming, storming, norming and performing. The four stages\nof group development identified by the inquirers can be analogised to the four stages identified by\nTuckman (1965). The forming, norming and performing stages are analogous to the first, third and\nfourth stage (Figure 4a, c & d). The second stage of Tuckman (1965) group development sequence,\nstorming, is associated with conflict, however the inquirers observed little overt conflict. The\nsecond group development stage identified by the inquirers (Figure 4b) is, nevertheless, associated\nwith conflict. The inquirers concluded that as the social skills of the executives involved were good,\nconflict was seldom expressed overtly. The process of establishing friendship and advice networks\nwas the process of identifying those with whom executives could relate, and it would seem that\nrather then expressing conflict overtly executives simply chose to ignore those who they felt unable\nto cooperate and collaborate with.\nA contribution of the distributed model of leadership was to provide a mechanism for\nreducing covert conflict associated with the underlying dislike of managers for one another. The\nprocess of adopting a leadership role and then specifically seeking out other managers who were\nadopting leadership roles with which they must form task based relational ties assisted in\novercoming blocks to communication. That relational ties were task accomplishment relational ties\nrather then friendship or advice relational ties helped managers who would otherwise not have\nA Role Based Perspective on Leadership as a Network of Relationships, As Sent to Print\nPage 28 of 37\nchosen to work together to do so. The effort made to establish relational ties resulted in managers\nbehaving differently to the way they had done previously, helping those involved to overcome their\npreconceptions about other managers and in so doing reduce group level conflict.\nTaken together, the distributed model of leadership and task relational ties between\nleadership roles provide structure to the leadership role theory first advocated by Sheard &\nKakabadse (2002). Executives are provided with a framework for action by:\n(1) Identifying themselves and others with specific leadership roles in a new group\nsituation, providing a vocabulary to discuss aspects of leadership needed in a new\nsituation.\n(2) Providing structure to the focus of each group member by defining leadership roles\nin terms of goal attainment and relationship building plus intra and inter-group\nprocess orientation.\n(3) Defining the primary relational ties group members must endeavour to establish and\ndevelop within a group, given the leadership role they choose to adopt.\n(4) Providing a mechanism for individual and group level conflict management by\ndefining an individual\u2019s contributing in terms of role, and in so doing helping to\nspecify the limit of each group member\u2019s authority and responsibility.\nA Role Based Perspective on Leadership as a Network of Relationships, As Sent to Print\nPage 29 of 37\n7. Concluding Comments\nThe process of familiarising executives with the leadership roles available to them\nconstitutes a form of role analysis. Role analysis is an intervention strategy, helping to define limits\nof responsibility and authority amongst executives who must work together if an organisation\u2019s\nsenior management team is to effectively address those issues with which it is faced. An\nunderstanding of the roles an individual can adopt, and those available to others within a group in\nwhich they must work, helps individuals to interpret a range of events in similar ways, and in so\ndoing adoption of leadership roles helps build supportive work-based relationships.\nThe existence of generic task accomplishment relational ties between leadership roles\ncomplements the previous work of Sheard & Kakabadse (2002) who initially conceptualised all\ntasks associated with leadership as being distributed amongst four separate and distinct leadership\nroles. The distributed leadership model helps group members to consider leadership roles in terms\nof goal attainment and relationship building plus intra and inter-group processes. This further\ncharacterisation of leadership roles is helpful during the process of defining the boundary around a\ngroup, identifying those individuals who should be a part of the group, and those outside the group\nwith whom inter-group exchanges need to take place.\nThe authors conclude that during the current study in many situations focus of the executives\ninvolved was excessively biased towards either goal attainment or relationship building. When the\nfocus was biased towards goal attainment, mobilisation of organisational resources was\ncompromised as poor inter-personal relationships acted as a block to raising and discussing sensitive\nissues. Further, when the focus was biased towards relationship building the executives involved\nhad a tendency to lose sight of the urgent business issue that required resolution, resulting in a lack\nof focus on goal attainment and a resulting failure of the groups of which they were a part to deploy\norganisational resources optimally.\nA Role Based Perspective on Leadership as a Network of Relationships, As Sent to Print\nPage 30 of 37\nThe existence of informal and temporary groups within the wider formal senior management\nteam was found to be a primary issue when contemplating the limits of authority and responsibility\nof executives occupying one of the four leadership roles. In many situations executive\u2019s focus\nwould be excessively biased towards either issues internal to the group of which they were a part, or\nalternatively excessively biased towards issues external to the group associated with the practical\ndifficulty of working with other groups within the senior management team. When the focus was\nbiased towards internal group processes, goal attainment was compromised due to an inability to\neffectively gather data and feedback from other groups within the senior management team. When\nfocus was biased towards inter-group processes, goal attainment was compromised by a failure to\nprovide the necessary structure and drive internally within the group.\nWhen contemplating the impact of the current study, the authors concluded that those\nexecutives who were consistently associated with groups that effectively attained their goal were\nable to:\n(1) Adopt the leadership role most appropriate when joining a new group.\n(2) Encourage other group members to adopt complementary leadership\nroles.\n(3) Identify when no individual was able to adopt a particular role and pro-\nactively seek a new group member to fulfil the role.\n(4) Identify when an individual was actually a member of another group\nwith whom inter-group exchanges needed to take place, and encourage\nother group members to regard them in this way and not as a member\nof the group.\n(5) Focus on pro-actively developing the task network relational ties\nassociated with the leadership role they had chosen to adopt, and by\nencouraging others to do the same help catalyse crystallisation of the\ngroup\u2019s task accomplishment network.\nA Role Based Perspective on Leadership as a Network of Relationships, As Sent to Print\nPage 31 of 37\nThe authors conclude that effective executives help to ensure everyone within a group adopts\none of the four leadership roles, that all roles are adequately represented and that appropriate inter-\ngroup relational ties are established. The process of adopting complementary leadership roles was\nthe process of defining limits of authority and responsibility. The process of ensuring that a group\ncontained members who collectively possessed the skills and knowledge to ensure every leadership\nrole was represented was the process of ensuring a group was able to effectively discharge its\nleadership responsibility. The process of establishing appropriate inter-group relational ties was the\nprocess of ensuring that the group communicated with other groups, gathering feedback on the result\nof proposed action and also information as to the changing nature of the organisational environment\ninto which the group\u2019s output would have to be accepted. The process of crystallising a task\naccomplishment network was the process of formalising how individuals would work together, and\nin so doing gain productive contributions from them.\nA Role Based Perspective on Leadership as a Network of Relationships, As Sent to Print\nPage 32 of 37\nReferences\nAvolio, B.J., Jung, D.I., Murry, W. & Sivasubramaniam, N.

This gives team members an insight into the context\nwithin which they are undertaking a specific sub-goal, and is an excellent form of communication.\n2 As a part of the goal planning exercise, the point at which external reviews will be conducted should be defined, and then\nreviews conducted as planned when these critical milestones are reached.\n3 Significance of good quality team leadership is such that the organisation should put in place a selection process that\nidentifies potential team leaders according to key professional criteria, followed by a personal development program for\nthem.\n4 The optimum team size and duration equates to a team objective requiring approximately two man-years of effort to\ndeliver. At present the organisation breaks down its top-level product development strategy into approximately six man-\nyear work packages. By defining its product development strategy in terms of two man-year work packages, the\norganisation would define it in optimal terms for a team-based approach to its implementation.\n5 An effective mechanism for load \/ capacity balancing is required. This is vital if the organisation is to adequately resource\nthose tasks that are undertaken, and prevent it from committing to undertake work that it does not have the capacity to\ndeliver.\nTable 2: Example Extract From Collaborative Inquiry Cycle #005 Conclusions.\nA Role Based Perspective on Leadership as a Network of Relationships, As Sent to Print\nPage 35 of 37\nSource: Adapted from Heron (1981), Heron and Reason (1981) and Kakabadse and Kakabadse (2003)\nFigure 1: The Collaborative Inquiry Cycle.\n4.
