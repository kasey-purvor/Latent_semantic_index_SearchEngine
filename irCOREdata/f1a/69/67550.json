statistical approach to identifying outliers: \nWave, spike and trough (WST) method\nTwo current approaches in diachronic CL studies\n\u2022 Focus on the statistical significance of trends over time.\n\u2013 Time points and the frequencies recorded at each point are \ntreated as variables -- regression analyses establish the extent \nof correlation between the variables. \n\u2013 E.g., Baayen & Renouf (1996), Millar (2009).\n\u2022 Focus on the statistical significance of frequency differences \nbetween two time points.\n\u2013 E.g. Leech & Smith (2006), Leech et al. (2009), Mair et al. \n(2003). \n\u2022 Regression analyses and pairwise frequency differences seem to \nbe adopted in studies of high and low granularity respectively.\nWST method: Nature and calculations\n\u2022 Combines the focus of current approaches.\n\u2022 Successive pairwise frequency comparisons.\n\u2013 Similar to keyword comparison: The frequency of each sampling \npoint is compared to that of the previous one .\n\u2013 Logarithm of frequency difference.\n\u2022 Spikes starting from troughs are more significant than those \nstarting from average-level or low-level spikes.\n\u2022 Statistical significance established through a non-parametric \nregression model: Y(t) = s(t) + Z(t)\n\u2013 s(t): function of time to be estimated.\n\u2013 Z(t): a sequence of independent error terms. \n\u2013 The model was fitted using the mgcv package (Wood, 2006) within R.\n\u2022 Two levels of statistical significance: 99%, 95%.\nWST method: Findings (1)\n\u2022 Statistically significant spikes and individual trigger events \nwere a subset of those identified manually.\n\u2022 Only two spikes (trigger events) characterise UK national press \nas a whole: 9\/11 and (to a lesser extent) 7\/7.\n\u2022 One significant spike unidentified by manual examination.\n\u2022 One trigger event misidentified by the manual method \n(different newspaper).\nManual WST\nSpikes 74 29\nTrigger events 19 9\nComparison of approaches: spikes in Islam corpus\n# Spike date bu ex gd in ml mr ob pp st su tg tm\n1 1998, Nov.-Dec.\n2 1999, January \uf0fc\n3 2000, June-July \uf0fc\n4 2000, Sept.-Oct. \uf0fc\n5 2001, Sept-Oct. \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc\n6 2002, March-April \uf0fc\n7 2003, March-April \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc\n8 2004, March-April \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc\n9 2005, July-Aug. \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc\n10 2005, October \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc\n11 2006, Jan-Feb. \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc\n12 2006,Oct.(-Dec) \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc\n13 2007, Jan.-Feb. \uf0fc \uf0fc\n14 2007, July \uf0fc \uf0fc\n15 2007, Oct.-Dec. \uf0fc \uf0fc\n16 2008, Feb. - March \uf0fc \uf0fc\n17 2008, July \uf0fc\n18 2009, March-April \uf0fc \uf0fc\n19 2009, June \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc\n20 2009, August \uf0fc\n050\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n1998            1999               2000               2001         2002 2003         2004         2005     2006         2007        2008            2009\n9\/11\n7\/7\nVeil\nC2\nSun\n???\nIraq\ninv.\nC\nprotests\nArchbi\nshop ???\nO in T\nIran\nelect.\n9\/11 7\/7\nSun\n050\n100\n150\n200\nObserver\n9\/11\nIraq\ninv.\n7\/7\nVeil\nC2\nC\nprotests\n1998             1999             2000           2001 2002             2003        2004           2005          2006       2007            2008         2009\nArchbi\nshop\nFlogging\nThailand\nSomalia\nObserver\nWST method: findings (2)\nInfluential events raise the bar for subsequent candidate spikes.\n\u2022 It will take an event of the same, if not greater, magnitude for \na statistically significant spike to be established later, ...\n\u2022 ... unless troughs in due course reduce the height of that \nnotional bar. \nAssessing the salience of contextual elements\nThree complementary ways:\n\u2022 The p-value of a given spike. \n\u2013 For example, spikes at the 99% level of confidence can be treated as \nmore salient than those at the 95% level.\n\u2022 The proportion of newspapers in which a particular event has \nregistered a spike. \n\u2013 For example, in our study, 9\/11 registered a spike in all newspapers.\n\u2022 The number of spikes that a particular event registers, either \noverall in the corpus, or in particular newspapers. \n\u2013 E.g., events registering multiple spikes can be treated as more salient \nthan those registering only one. \n\u2013 Clear example from our study are 9\/11 and 7\/7.\nSummary\n\u2022 Granularity is important for diachronic corpus studies.\n\u2022 Corpus trends need to be compared to trends in sub-corpora.\n\u2022 Identification of peaks points towards ...\n\u2013 time periods to be examined more closely.\n\u2013 time periods for CDA downsampling.\n\u2013 salient contextual elements to inform conclusions.\n\u2022 The WST method establishes ...\n\u2013 statistically significant peaks and troughs,\n\u2013 diachronic frequency trends.\n\u2013 a much lower number of spikes and trigger events.\nReferences\nBaayen, R.H. & Renouf, A.
