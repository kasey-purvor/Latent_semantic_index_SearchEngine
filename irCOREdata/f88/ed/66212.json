INTRODUCTION \n \nFacial masculinity is due to the sexual dimorphism in facial features which emerges at puberty when \nboys\u2019 cranial bones grow, producing heavier brow-ridges and larger jaws, while girls\u2019 faces grow less \nand retain small brows (leading to a perception of larger eyes), jaws and noses (Enlow & Hans, 1996; \nPenton-Voak, Jones, Little, Baker, Tiddeman, Burt & Perrett, 2001).  Research has shown varying \npreferences for masculinity in male faces, with some studies finding a female preference for feminine \nlooking males (e.g. Perrett, Lee, Rowland, Yoshikawa, Burt, Henzi, Castle & Akamatsu, 1998; Rhodes, \nHickford & Jeffery, 2000) and some a preference for masculine looking males (e.g. Johnston, Hagel, \nFranklin, Fink, & Grammer, 2001).  Rather than being arbitrary, however, women\u2019s preferences for \nmasculinity in male faces vary systematically as a result of their own attractiveness (Little, Burt, Penton-\nVoak & Perrett, 2001; Penton-Voak, Little, Jones, Burt, Tiddeman & Perrett, 2003), the phase of their \nmenstrual cycle (Penton-Voak, Perrett, Castles, Kobayashi, Burt, Murray & Minimasawa, 1999; \nJohnston et al, 2001), and whether or not they have a partner (Little, Jones, Penton-Voak, Burt & Perrett, \n2002). \n \nTwo different explanations for the possible benefits of masculinity and femininity in male faces have \nbeen proposed.  The \u2018immunocompetence\u2019 explanation, rests on a possible direct link between sex \nhormones and facial features, while the \u2018neoteny\u2019 explanation rests upon the link between facial growth \nand age. \n \n1.1 IMMUNOCOMPETENCE \nFolstad & Karter\u2019s (1992) Immunocompetence Hypothesis proposes that secondary sexual features \n(those resulting from sex hormones) are honest signals of genetic quality because sex hormones, \nspecifically testosterone, are deleterious to the immune system (Angele & Faist, 2000; Messingham, \nShirazi, Duffner, Emanuele & Kovacs, 2001).  Only high quality, healthy males may be able to tolerate \nthe immunosuppressive effects of testosterone and develop exaggerated secondary sexual traits.  \nTestosterone injections cause increased cranio-facial growth (Verdonck, Gaethofs, Carels & de Zegher, \n 4\n1999) and jaw size and perceived facial masculinity are positively related to circulating testosterone \nlevels in adult males (Chen, 2002; Penton-Voak & Chen, 2004).  Attraction to masculine proportions in \nmale faces may, therefore, reflect preferences for men displaying cues associated with immunity to \ninfectious disease.  This explanation has been widely adopted within facial attraction research (e.g. \nThornhill & Gangestad, 1999; Rhodes et al, 2000; Penton-Voak et al, 1999; Johnston et al., 2001).  \nRatings of men\u2019s facial masculinity are also related to their rated apparent health (Rhodes, Chan, \nZebrowitz & Simmons, 2003; Johnston et al, 2001) as well as actual medical health (Rhodes et al, 2003) \nwhich would seem to support an immunocompetence explanation.  It should be noted however, that in \nthe wider literature, whether greater testosterone is associated with greater apparent health or reduced \nparasite load across individuals (as opposed to within individuals) is unclear, with mixed findings across \ndifferent species (see Getty, 2002, for a review and possible reasons for this). \n \n1.2 NEOTENY \nManipulating sexually dimorphic characteristics in faces influences attributions of age, in addition to \nattributions of masculinity. Increasing feminine traits in faces decreases apparent age (i.e. increases \nattributions of youth; see e.g. Berry & McArthur, 1985, Perrett et al, 1998).  Several researchers have \nemphasised neoteny, or \u2018baby-facedness\u2019, rather than sexual dimorphism per se in their accounts of face \npreferences.  For example, in a series of studies, Cunningham and various co-workers (Cunningham, \nBarbee & Pike, 1990; Cunningham, Druen & Barbee, 1997) suggested that \u2018neotenous\u2019 facial features \ndenote youth versus maturity and do not discuss neotenous features in terms of characteristics associated \nwith femininity (see also Jones, 1995; Berry & McArthur, 1985).  The \u2018Multiple Fitness Model\u2019 \n(Cunningham et al, 1997) proposes that women prefer men with neotenous features because these \nfeatures evoke feelings of nurturance and youthful men are perceived as having the vigour required to \nraise children.  In light of this, it is plausible that variation in preferences for sexual dimorphism in faces \nis a by-product of variation in preferences for facial cues associated with youth. \n \n1.3 RATIONALE \nThe purpose of Study 1 was to investigate the possible links between masculinity (face shape \n 5\ndimorphism, sensu Perrett et al., 1998; Penton-Voak et al, 1999) and age and apparent health (sensu \nJones et al., 2001) in female preferences for male faces.  Doing so allows assessment of the functional \nsimilarity between masculinity and health\/age (i.e. are they used in the same way for mate choice \ndecisions), which is perhaps more informative to attraction research than assessing purely perceptual \nrelationships.  Apparent health in male faces is associated with indices of men\u2019s genotypic health (MHC \nheterozygosity: Roberts, Petrie, Gosling, Perrett, Little, Jones, Penton-Voak, & Carter, 2003) and also \nrelated to putative indices of men\u2019s immune system strength (e.g. facial symmetry: Rhodes et al., 2001; \nJones et al., 2001; Penton-Voak et al., 2001) and is therefore an appropriate trait to compare with \nmasculinity when testing the immunocompetence explanation.  If masculinity preferences are positively \nrelated to preferences for apparent health (but not preferences for older faces), this would support the \nmodels of variation in face preferences derived from the immunocompetence hypothesis.  Alternatively, \nif masculinity preferences are positively related to preferences for older faces (but not preferences for \napparent health), this would support the neoteny explanation of variation in face preferences. \n \nStudy 2 directly assessed the perceptual relationships between these characteristics in facial stimuli by \nexamining the effects of manipulating masculinity on perceptions of health and age, and vice versa.  \nEvidence that facial masculinity is associated with health (but not age) would support the \nimmunocompetence explanation. By contrast, evidence that facial masculinity is associated with age \n(but not apparent health) would support the neoteny explanation.  \n \nParticipants in Studies 1a and 2a were members of the public recruited for online studies of face \npreferences. Participants in Studies 1b and 2b were undergraduate students recruited for a laboratory \nstudy of face preferences. Two sets of stimuli were used, which were manufactured from independent \nsamples of face images, to establish if our findings were consistent across independent samples of faces \n(Studies 1a and 2a use Set A, while Studies 1b and 2b used Set B). \n \n 6\n2. STUDY 1 \n \nThis study investigated how variation in female preferences for facial masculinity relates to variation in \npreferences for health and age.  If masculinity is a proxy for immunocompetence then masculinity \npreferences should covary with preferences for apparent health.  By contrast, the neoteny explanation \npredicts that masculinity preference should covary with age preference but does not predict a link \nbetween masculinity preference and health preference. \n \n2.1 STUDY 1A \n \n2.1.1 Participants \n \nThere were 645 female participants (mean age=26.7\u00b16.7 years, range=16-45) recruited through the \nlaboratory website and the media.  The majority of participants reported being of Western origin (42.0% \nBritish, 25.5% European, 22.2% North American) and 84.7% reported being Caucasian.  All participants \nreported being heterosexual. \n \n2.1.2 Stimuli (Set A) \n \nThree textured composite male base faces were created using the face processing package \n\u2018Psychomorph\u2019 (for explanation of methods, see Tiddeman, Burt & Perrett, 2001).  The base faces are \ndepicted in Figure 1. \n \nFIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE. \n \n\u2018Transforms\u2019 were then applied to the base faces to alter apparent masculinity, age and health.  The \ntransformation process involved calculating the differences in skin colour, face shape and skin texture \nbetween a prototype \u2018source\u2019 face (e.g. a younger face) and a prototype \u2018destination\u2019 face (e.g. an older \n 7\nface) and applying a proportion of that difference to the base face.  The difference could be both \u2018added \nto\u2019 the base face (a positive transform, e.g. aging the face) or \u2018subtracted from\u2019 the base face (a negative \ntransform, e.g. making the face look younger).  After transformation, all images were masked so that \nonly the faces were visible (i.e. hair, neck and ears were excluded) and were standardised to a size of \n400x533 pixels, with inter-pupillary distance being approximately 150 pixels.   \n2.1.2.1 Age \nThe prototype faces used for the age transforms were a composite of 19 males aged 8-12 years versus a \ncomposite of 15 males aged 45-55 years.  All faces used in the transform composites were Caucasian \nwith no facial hair.  The base faces were transformed by adding and subtracting 15% of the difference \nbetween the 2 prototypes (see Figure 2 for an example); colour, shape and texture were all manipulated.   \n \nFIGURE 2 ABOUT HERE \n2.1.2.2 Masculinity \nThe prototypes used for the masculinity transform were a composite of 40 Caucasian females and a \ncomposite of 21 Caucasian males.  Both prototypes consisted of individuals of the same age (mean 21.0 \nyears) in order to manipulate masculinity without affecting apparent age.  The shape of the faces was \ntransformed 50% in each direction (see Figure 2).  Colour and texture were not changed as this produces \nunrealistic changes to feminised images (e.g. abnormally light skin in the place of stubble).   \n \n2.1.2.3 Health \nThe prototypes used for the health transforms were composites of the faces judged most and least \nhealthy from a set of 96 Caucasian male faces (healthy: n=15, mean rated health=5.0, mean age=20.5; \nunhealthy, n=15, mean rated health=3.2, mean age=22.2) all of whom had been rated by 8 males and 7 \nfemales for apparent general health on a Likert scale from 1 to 7 (where 1= very unhealthy and 7=very \nhealthy).  The 3 base faces were transformed 50% in each direction (see Figure 2); colour, shape and \ntexture were all manipulated.  \n  \n 8\n2.1.3 Stimulus Validation \n \nUsing their own computers, a voluntary sample of 35 women (mean age=26.4\u00b19.4) participated via the \ntest website.  After being asked their age, participants began the test.  A pair of faces was presented \nusing a Java applet, taking up most of the screen.  Participants were asked to indicate which face was \nmore masculine (when judging the 3 masculinity pairs) or healthy (when judging the 3 health pairs) on a \nscale underneath the faces which had the following points from left to right: \u2018much more (left), \u2018more\u2019, \n\u2018slightly more\u2019, \u2018guess (left)\u2019, \u2018guess (right)\u2019, \u2018slightly more\u2019, \u2018more\u2019, much more (right)\u2019 (see Figure 3 \nfor the face preference version of the applet).  The results were recorded as an 8-point scale in which 0 \nrepresented a very confident choice for the \u2018incorrect\u2019 face and 7 represented a very confident choice for \nthe \u2018correct\u2019 face.  Thus a mean rating of 3.5 represented no perceived difference between the faces. \n \nDuring presentation, the order of face pairs and the left\/right position of each face within the pairs were \nboth randomised.  Judgement order was fixed as health followed by masculinity and finally age.  For \nassessment of age, all 6 faces were presented at one time.  Above each face was a box in which \nparticipants were asked to type the age they estimated that face to be. \n \nThe mean ratings by each participant for health and masculinity were calculated for each set of 3 pairs.  \nParticipants correctly identified the more masculine and healthy faces in that mean scores were \nsignificantly above 3.5 on both traits (masculinity: mean=4.39, t34=5.73, p<0.001; health: mean=5.04, \nt34=7.93, p<0.001).  Estimated ages of age stimuli were averaged for all \u2018old\u2019 faces and for all \u2018young\u2019 \nfaces and compared using matched t-tests; \u2018older\u2019 faces were judged to be significantly older than the \n\u2018younger\u2019 faces (mean perceived age gap=2.16 years, t34=5.12, p<0.001).   \n \n2.1.4 Face Preference Test \nPairs were presented side by side in the same Java applet as was used for the stimulus validation (see \nFigure 3).  Results were recorded on an 8 point scale where 0 represented a preference for \nfeminine\/young\/unhealthy faces and 7 represented a preference for masculine\/old\/healthy faces.  In the \n 9\ninitial instructions participants were told first to decide which of each pair \u201cyou find more attractive\u201d \nand then to indicate the strength of that preference on the scale below the faces.  The reminder \u201cPlease \nindicate which face you prefer and how much you prefer it, by clicking a point below\u201d ran at the top of \nthe screen throughout the test.  \n \nFIGURE 3 ABOUT HERE \n \n2.1.5 Results \nMean scores were calculated for the participants\u2019 rated preference (0-7) averaged across all three pairs \nwithin each transform set (overall preference means: health mean=5.03\u00b11.08; age mean=3.82\u00b11.42; \nmasculinity mean=3.24\u00b11.25).  Age preferences correlated significantly with masculinity preferences \n(rs=0.23, n=645, p<0.001), but there was no significant correlation between masculinity preferences and \nhealth preferences (rs=0.02, n=645).  There was no effect of participant\u2019s age on their preferences \n(masculinity rs=0.02, age rs=-0.05, health rs=0.04, n=645) and correlations between preferences for \nmasculinity, health, and age were equivalent when participant\u2019s age was partialled out. \n \n2.2 STUDY 1B \nIn order to assess the replicability of Study 1a, Study 1b used an independent set of stimuli and a \ndifferent participant group.  It had the same design as Study 1a but was carried out within the University \nof St Andrews on laboratory computers, rather than with the public via the internet. \n \n2.2.1 Participants \nThere were 160 heterosexual female participants (mean age=20.73\u00b11.97 years, range=17-30) who were \nundergraduate students and completed the study in the laboratory.   \n \n2.2.2 Stimuli (Set B) \n18 base faces were constructed by averaging 10 randomly chosen faces.  6 of these base faces were then \ntransformed along the dimensions of masculinity (sexual dimorphism) and 6 were transformed on \n 10\napparent health using the same methodology as in Stimuli Set A but with new independent composites \nbeing used for the transforms.  The masculinity and health stimuli have previously been reported by \nCornwell et al (2004) and Jones (2004) respectively.  The only departure from the methodology used in \nStudy 1a was in the age transforms applied to the remaining 6 base faces.  The prototype faces used for \nthe age transforms were a composite of 15 males aged 15-18 years versus a composite of 15 males aged \n25-29 years.  The base faces were transformed by adding and subtracting 30% of the difference between \nthe 2 prototypes; as before, colour, shape and texture were all manipulated.   \n \n2.2.3 Stimulus Validation \n11 women (mean age=23.3\u00b16.1) assessed the health and masculinity of the health and masculinity \nstimuli respectively.  Testing took place in the laboratory on computers.  The participants were \npresented with the face pairs and asked, within each pair, which looked more masculine\/healthy.  Face \npairs were presented in a random order within each judgement-block and the order of judging \nmasculinity and health was randomised.  The computer returned the data as a dichotomous result in \nwhich 0 indicated a choice for the feminine or unhealthy face and 1 indicated a choice for the masculine \nor healthy face.  For each subject the proportion of masculine faces chosen over feminine faces, and \nproportion of healthy faces chosen versus unhealthy was calculated.  Proportions were compared against \nchance (0.5) using one-sample t-tests.  Subjects selected the correct faces significantly more than chance \nfor both masculinity (mean=0.89, t10=8.48, p<0.001) and health (mean=0.92, t10=9.04, p<0.001).   \n \nThe age stimuli were validated by 16 women (mean age=21.9\u00b12.8).  Testing took place in the laboratory \non computers.  The faces were presented individually in a random order.  Beside each face was a box in \nwhich participants were asked to type the age they estimated that face to be.  \u2018Older\u2019 faces were judged \nto be significantly older than the \u2018younger\u2019 faces (mean perceived age gap=2.28 years, t15=4.54, \np<0.001).   \n \n2.2.4 Face Preference Test \nThe face preference test was the same as used in Study 1a.  However, this time participants were given \n 11\nthe test twice: once with the instruction to make the attractiveness judgement based on choosing a \npotential long term partner and once based on choosing a potential short term partner.  The order of long \nand short term judgements was randomised. \n \n2.2.5 Results \nMasculinity preference correlated significantly with age preference for short term preferences (rs=0.22, \nn=160, p=0.005) but not for long term (rs=0.05).  There was no correlation between masculinity and \nhealth preferences (short term: rs=0.03; long term: rs=0.004).  Participant\u2019s age did not correlate with \nany short term preferences or with long term masculinity preferences (all rs<0.13), although younger \nwomen preferred younger (rs=0.18, p<0.05) and healthier (rs=0.18, p<0.05) long term partners \n(correlations between preferences for masculinity, health, and age were equivalent when participant\u2019s \nage was partialled out). \n \n2.3 DISCUSSION \nStudies 1a and 1b found a link between preference for masculinity and preference for age in male faces, \nbut no link between preference for masculinity and preference for health in male faces.   \n \nThe positive relationship between masculinity preference and age preference supports Cunningham et \nal\u2019s (1997) discussion of youth and maturity related traits as a basis for attractiveness of adult male \nfeatures.  The absence of a link between preference for health and masculinity in male faces, however, \nsuggests that facial masculinity is not utilised in female mate choice as a proxy for health.  Although this \ncontrasts with Johnston et al\u2019s (2001) and Rhodes et al\u2019s (2003) findings regarding the perceptual \nsimilarity of health and masculinity, it is consistent with Rhodes et al\u2019s observation that the link between \nperceived masculinity and perceived health did not explain the correlation between attractiveness and \nmasculinity.     \n 12\n3. STUDY 2 \n \nIn order to investigate further the relationship between masculinity, health and age, the stimuli from \nStudies 1a and b were cross-rated on masculinity, health and age in Studies 2a and 2b respectively.  The \nmasculinity stimuli were assessed for apparent age and health, and the health and age stimuli were \nassessed for apparent masculinity.   \n \nIn light of the results of study 1, it was hypothesised that increasing masculinity would increase the \nperceived age of faces (and vice versa) but that increasing masculinity would not influence attributions \nof health and that increasing apparent health would not influence attributions of masculinity. \n \nBy contrast, the Immunocompetence explanation might predict that increasing sexual dimorphism in \nfacial shape should increase perceived health, and vice versa, but makes no specific prediction regarding \nattributions\/manipulations of age. \n \n3.1 STUDY 2A \n \n3.1.1 Participants \nA volunteer sample of 47 females (mean age=28.4\u00b110.2 years, range 18-46) was recruited through the \nlaboratory website.   \n \n3.1.2 Stimuli (Set A) \nThe same stimuli were used as in Study 1a; i.e. 3 base faces transformed to create 3 masculinity pairs, 3 \nage pairs and 3 health pairs. \n \n3.1.3 Procedure \n \nParticipants completed the experiment on their own computers.  They were asked to estimate the ages of \n 13\nthe 6 health (3 healthy, 3 unhealthy) and 6 masculinity (3 masculine, 3 feminine) stimuli in the same \nway as the participants in Study 1.  They were then asked to decide which face of each age and health \npair looked the most masculine, and which of each masculinity pair looked the healthiest using the same \n8-point scale as in Study 1.  All participants judged age, followed by masculinity and then health.  Inter-\nrater agreement was high for both masculinity and health ratings and for age estimates (all Cronbach\u2019s \nalphas >0.85). \n \n3.1.4 Results \n \nEach participant\u2019s age estimates were combined for the 3 high masculinity and 3 low masculinity faces \nseparately.  Similarly, pairs of age estimates were derived for the 3 high health and the 3 low health \nfaces.  Masculinity and health ratings for the 3 pairs were averaged into single composite scores \nseparately for each judgement.   \n3.1.4.1 Age and Masculinisation \nA repeated measures t-test showed that masculinised faces were perceived as significantly older than \nfeminised faces (mean perceived age gap=1.72 years, t46=4.00, p<0.001).  One-sample t-tests showed \nthat there was also a significant effect of manipulating facial age on perception of masculinity.  As in \nStudy 1, mean scores were compared against 3.5, which would indicate no perceived difference between \nthe two faces.  Mean scores for the age pairs were significantly above 3.5 (mean=5.10, t46=9.94, \np<0.001) showing that participants perceived the older faces as being more masculine.   \n3.1.4.2 Health and masculinisation \nThere was a significant effect of manipulating facial health on perception of masculinity and also an \neffect of manipulating masculinity on perception of health.  Mean scores for masculinity ratings of \nhealth pairs were significantly above 3.5 (mean=4.59, t46=5.82, p<0.001), showing that participants \nperceived the healthier males as more masculine.  In contrast, mean scores for health ratings of \nmasculinity pairs were significantly below 3.5 (mean=2.87, t46=4.26, p<0.001) showing that participants \nperceived the more feminine faces as being healthier than the masculine faces.   \n 14\n \n3.2 STUDY 2B \n \n3.2.1 Participants \nThere was a sample of 30 female undergraduate students (age range 21 to 50 years). \n \n3.2.2 Stimuli (Set B) \nThe same stimuli were used as in Study 1b: i.e. 6 masculinity pairs, 6 health pairs and 6 age pairs. \n \n3.2.3 Procedure \nThe participants completed the task on computers in departmental laboratories.  They rated the \nmasculinity and health of the stimuli as in Study 2a.  However, rather than guessing the ages of the \nstimuli they compared each pair and rated which of the faces appeared older, using the same method as \nfor the masculinity and health ratings.  Order of rating health, masculinity and age was randomised. \n \n3.2.4 Results \n3.2.4.1 Age and Masculinisation \nMean scores for the age ratings of the masculinity pairs did not differ significantly from 3.5 (mean=3.71, \nt29=1.01) showing that participants perceived neither face as being older.  Mean scores for the \nmasculinity ratings of the age pairs were significantly above 3.5 (mean=5.04, t29=11.12, p<0.001) \nshowing that participants perceived the older faces as being more masculine.   \n \n3.2.4.2 Health and masculinisation \nMean scores for masculinity ratings of health pairs were significantly above the indifference point of 3.5 \n(mean=3.99, t29=2.24, p<0.05) showing that participants perceived the healthier males as more \nmasculine.  Mean scores for health ratings of masculinity pairs did not differ from 3.5 (mean=3.51, \nt29=0.06) showing that neither face appeared healthier.   \n 15\n \nTable 1. gives a summary of the results of Study 2.   TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE \n \n3.3 DISCUSSION \n \nThe purpose of Study 2 was to assess the degree to which masculinity is associated with perceptions of \nage and health.  It was found that masculinity and age in faces are perceptually related.  Artificially \n\u2018aging\u2019 a face caused increased attributions of masculinity in both stimulus sets, while masculinising the \nshape of a face led to an increase in perceived age in Study 2a.  As the composites used in the \nmasculinity transformation were of males and females of the same age, this demonstrates that \nmasculinisation has an effect on perceived age independent of actual age.  The lack of effect in Study 2b \ncould be due to the different rating method: in Study 2b participants rated which face within each pair \nlooked older, while in Study 2a they estimated the ages of each face separately.   \n \nWhen participants rated health and masculinity, increasing masculinity of a face shape either decreased \nperceptions of health (Study 2a) or had no effect at all (Study 2b). In contrast, increasing perceived \nhealth increased perceived masculinity in both Studies 2a and 2b.  While this ambiguous result does not \nnecessarily contradict the Immunocompetence Hypothesis (since the signal need not represent actual \n\u2018parasite load\u2019, nor be consciously perceivable), it does contrast with the findings of Rhodes et al\u2019s \n(2003) correlational study and Johnston et al\u2019s (2001) computer graphic study.  This contradiction and \nthe ambiguity in the current results may be because the health transforms manipulated shape, colour and \ntexture, while the masculinity transform changed only the shape of the faces and features.  Thus healthy, \ndark skin might suggest masculinity, while the lack of change in skin texture in masculinity transforms \ncould obscure an apparent health difference.  However, in previous work suggesting that masculinity is \nlinked to genotype quality (e.g. Penton-Voak et al, 1999), researchers also manipulated only sexual \ndimorphism of face shape.  Therefore, while the masculinity stimuli may lack a degree of ecological \nvalidity, the current result (that masculinisation has no clear effect on perceived health) is still important \nwhen considering previous mate choice studies. \n 16\n4. GENERAL DISCUSSION \n \nThese studies investigated the proposal that attraction to facial masculinity could be due to either an \nattraction to advertised immunocompetence or a by-product of attraction to maturity.  Study 1 showed, \nusing two independent stimulus sets, that masculinity and age have a similar impact on attraction but \nthat apparent facial health affects attraction independently of facial masculinity.  While the association \nbetween masculinity and age preferences does not mean that facial age and facial masculinity are the \nsame, these findings do suggest that the two traits are used in similar ways when judging faces; indeed, \nStudy 2 suggests that perceptions of age and masculinity relate to similar features in the face.   \n \nThere is little evidence in this study to support an Immunocompetence explanation of female attraction \nto facial masculinity.  Neither stimulus set showed any correlation between masculinity preferences and \npreferences for apparent health, and increasing facial masculinity did not increase perceived health \n(although healthier faces did look more masculine).  This does not rule out a link between masculinity \nand real or underlying health but these results suggest apparent health is of limited importance in \nmasculinity preferences with regard to facial shape. \n \nGiven these results, the question is then raised as to the validity of theories relying on \u2018good-genes\u2019 \nexplanations of attraction to facial masculinity.  Cunningham et al (1997) did not rely on \u2018good-genes\u2019 \nin that they suggested that women trade-off the virility, strength and status of mature males with the fact \nthat neotenous faces trigger the nurturance instinct.  This does not, however, explain why women who \nconsider themselves to be unattractive would be more drawn to neoteny more than other women (Little \net al, 2001) or why women would require a stronger partner at peak fertility points in their menstrual \ncycle (Penton-Voak et al, 1999).  It may be that maturity and\/or masculinity is associated with some \nother feature which is both heritable and associated with greater reproductive success in offspring \npossessing that feature.  For instance, dominance and status may be heritable and may be associated with \nhigher potential or real reproductive success (e.g. P\u00e9russe, 1993; Mueller & Mazur, 1997).  If this is the \ncase, masculine men could still be attractive in short term contexts for their \u2018good\u2019, high status genes \n 17\nwhich they would pass on to \u2018sexy sons\u2019 (sensu Weatherhead & Robertson. 1979), but would remain \nless attractive in long term contexts because their high reproductive success comes at the expense of \npotentially reduced paternal investment in offspring.  As has been previously shown, facial masculinity \nis perceived as being associated with increased dominance but decreased suitability to be a father \n(Perrett et al, 1998).  Alternatively, a simple \u2018Fisherian\u2019 female bias in favour of masculinity could \nproduce a similar pattern (for avian evidence of the impacts of arbitrary attractiveness on sexual strategy \nand paternal care see Burley, Parker & Lundy, 1996; Magrath & Elgar, 1997). \n \nCollectively our findings suggest that the assumption that a preference for masculinity in males is due to \na preference for immunocompetence should be treated cautiously; the present data fail to support this \nview.  Indeed, there is also a lack of strong evidence for a link between testosterone and immune \nfunction in humans (Angele & Faist, 2000) and mammals in general (Roberts, Buchanan & Evans, \n2004).  Facial attraction researchers should perhaps consider alternative advantages and disadvantages \nof facial masculinity, such as dominance and sexy-sons versus paternal investment. \n \n \nREFERENCES \n \nAngele, M.K. & Faist, E.
