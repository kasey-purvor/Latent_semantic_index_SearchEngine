Introduction \n \nThere are now a number of models\/software tools available for use in \nenvironmental impact assessments to estimate the exposure of non-human biota (i.e. \nwildlife) to radioactivity (Beresford et al., in-press). It has been suggested that, when \nassessing radiation impacts on non-human biota, estimated dose rates due to \nanthropogenically released radionuclides should be put in context by comparison to dose \nrates from natural background radiation normally experienced by animals and plants \n(Pentreath, 1999; 2002). This concept is being considered further by the International \nCommission on Radiation Protection (ICRP, 2005). The use of background exposure \nrates to put results of assessments into context is also recommended in the interpretation \nof results from the ERICA Tool (Beresford et al., 2007a; Brown et al., this issue). \nIn order to make these comparisons, we need comprehensive data on the activity \nconcentrations of naturally occurring radionuclides in environmental media (i.e. soil, \nwater and sediments) and organisms of interest. Brown et al. (2004) presented a review \nof such data for European marine organisms concluding that, whilst information for a \nfew organisms (namely marine mammals and seabirds) were lacking, the ranges in dose \nrates from natural radionuclides to most marine organisms could be readily estimated. \nHowever, the same authors reported that there were insufficient data to conduct \nassessments for many freshwater organisms of interest. There is also an acknowledged \nlack of data for naturally occurring radionuclides concentrations in terrestrial wildlife \n(e.g. Jones et al., 2003). In their assessment of the exposure of terrestrial organisms to \nnaturally occurring radionuclides G\u00f3mez-Ros et al. (2004) used no data for wild \nterrestrial species, instead their assessment was based upon reported activity \nconcentrations in agricultural crops and livestock. \nThis paper presents the results of a study to determine the exposure of terrestrial \norganisms in England and Wales to naturally occurring radionuclides, specifically \n40\nK, \n238\nU series and \n232\nTh series (see Table 1). This suite of radionuclides includes the \nprincipal contributors to background radiation exposure. Initial results from this work \n(Beresford et al., 2007b) were used to estimate the background dose rates to terrestrial \norganisms for inclusion within the ERICA Tool (available from \nwww.project.facilia.se\/erica\/download.html).  \n \n2. Materials and Methods \n2.1 Proposed ICRP reference animal and plants \nThe ICRP has recently suggested a set of reference animals and plants (RAPs) as \npoints of reference for assessing radiation effects in non-human species (ICRP, 2005). \nWith respect to terrestrial ecosystems, the proposed list of reference animals and plants \ncomprises: Reference Deer; Reference Rat; Reference Duck; Reference Frog; Reference \nBee; Reference Earthworm; Reference Pine Tree; Reference Wild Grass. An objective \nof the work described in this paper was to categorise available data for naturally \noccurring radionuclides in England and Wales on the basis of these RAPs. \n2.2 Review of available data \nThe first stage of the study was to determine the availability of data on natural \nradionuclide activity concentrations in terrestrial RAPs. Whilst the focus of this review \n 4 \nwas England and Wales, available data for all of the United Kingdom were collated as it \nsoon became evident that there would be few data if the review was restricted to \nEngland and Wales alone.  Available sources of data for natural radionuclide activity \nconcentrations in biota included: (i) \u2018grey\u2019 literature; (ii) refereed journal papers; (iii) in-\nhouse databases. \nThe RIFE (Radioactivity in Food and the Environment) reports are published \nannually by UK agencies and report radionuclide activity concentrations throughout the \nUnited Kingdom (predominantly close to sites discharging radionuclides to the \nenvironment).  These reports provided activity concentrations for some naturally \noccurring radionuclides in relevant biota such as game and plant species. With the \nexception of grass, sampled biota are the edible components of species eaten by man. \nData were compiled from RIFE reports presenting the results of sampling conducted \nbetween 1995 and 2004 (MAFF, 1996; MAFF and SEPA, 1997; 1998; 1999; FSA and \nSEPA, 2000; 2001; 2002; EA et al., 2003; 2004; 2005).  \nTo review the refereed literature, 88 variations of keyword searches were \nperformed using Web of Knowledge (http:\/\/wok.mimas.ac.uk\/) and in house \nradioecological bibliographical databases. Whilst this identified a large number of \nreferences (>7,000 references) to review, only 5 yielded usable data (more details of the \nliterature review can be found in Beresford et al., 2007b).  \nThe Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH) has previously conducted many \nanalyses of relevant biota types for anthropogenic radionuclides. These samples were \nobtained from studies conducted into the deposition and behaviour of radiocaesium \ndeposited following the 1986 Chernobyl accident, and assessments of the transfer of \nradioactivity discharged from the Sellafield reprocessing plant (Horrill et al., 1988; \nHorrill and Mudge, 1990). Whilst previously not always reported, the gamma analysis \nof these samples yielded results for \n40\nK and these data were collated from existing \ndatabases, or the original analytical reports.  \nIn the preliminary stages of the work it was recognised that much of the available \ndata were not specific to the proposed ICRP RAPs. Therefore, available data were \nattributed to appropriate RAPs as follows: \n Reference Duck \u2013 any species of wild bird \n Reference Frog \u2013 any species of amphibian \n Reference Bee \u2013 any species of flying insect \n Reference Earthworm \u2013 any species of earthworm \n Reference Pine Tree \u2013 any species of tree \n Reference Wild Grass \u2013 any species of wild grass or herb, and any data \nrecorded as \u2018grass\u2019 \nBecause the ICRP recommend two mammalian RAPs, data were collated for \u2018any \nwild mammalian species\u2019 and separately for deer (data for any species of wild deer) and \nrat. Although this categorisation has been used to attribute data to RAPs the availability \nof data specifically for the RAP as defined by ICRP is also briefly discussed. \n2.2.1 Availability of data \n 5 \nTable 2 summarises the availability of data by RAP and radionuclide (data sources \nare also identified). The most abundant data were available for \n40\nK; the majority of \nwhich was sourced from available CEH databases; no data were identified for \n228\nTh. \nMany of the data for mammals and birds were from Scotland reflecting the focus of post \nChernobyl studies; little data originated from Wales. No data were available for: Frog, \nBee or Earthworm nor specifically for the proposed Reference Rat.  All of the data \nallocated to Pine Tree were predominantly for edible fruits of deciduous trees.  \n2.3 Sampling and analyses  \nOn the basis of the comparative lack of available data, a targeted sampling and \nmeasurement campaign to provide data for Duck, Bee, Earthworm, Pine Tree and Frog \nwas conducted. Where possible, existing sample archives available to CEH were utilised \nin combination with targeted sampling. Samples obtained comprised:  \n A mixed sample (1-2 g dry weight) of flying insects (predominantly moths) \nfrom each of the eight terrestrial Environmental Change Network sites in \nEngland and Wales (see www.ecn.ac.uk) \n Five samples of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) trunk \n 20 samples of grey heron liver (Ardea cinerea) obtained from CEH\u2019s \nPredatory Birds Monitoring Scheme sample archive (see  \nhttp:\/\/pbms.ceh.ac.uk\/)  \n Six earthworm samples \n Four rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) \n One toad (Bufo spp.) obtained from CEH sample archives \n Five mallards (Anas platyrhynchos)  \nBecause of the paucity of existing data from Wales all rabbit samples, four \nmallards, three samples of lodgepole pine and two earthworm samples were obtained \nfrom the principality; nine of the heron liver samples selected for analyses had also been \ncollected from Wales.  \n2.3.1 Sample preparation and analyses \nSamples of lodgepole pine trunk were first washed before being ashed at 450\no\nC.  \nEarthworm were kept on wet tissue paper for circa 2 days to allow evacuation of \ntheir guts. Samples were freeze dried and homogenised prior to analyses. Insect samples \nwere supplied dry, these were homogenised prior to analyses. \nMallards were plucked and their gastrointestinal tract removed; the liver was \nremoved for separate analyses.  Rabbits were skinned and their claws and \ngastrointestinal tract removed. Both rabbit and mallard carcasses were washed prior to \nashing at 450\no\nC. Herons and mallard liver samples were freeze dried before \nhomogenisation. \nDepending upon sample size, ashed and dried samples were accurately weighed \ninto either 25 ml petri dishes or 150 ml plastic containers. These were sealed and stored \nfor 25 days to allow secular equilibrium to be established. They were subsequently \nanalysed by gamma spectrometry on hyper-pure germanium detectors to determine \n 6 \ngamma-emitting radionuclide activity concentrations; two day count times were used \nfor all samples and resultant spectra were analysed using Canberra Genie-VMS. The \ndetectors were calibrated for the energy range 59.5 to 1836 keV using certified \nreference solutions added to materials of various densities (samples in this study were \nanalysed using a dried ground vegetation efficiency calibration). Due to the small \nsample size, the toad sample was homogenised and analysed fresh (using an aqueous \nsolution efficiency calibration); the sample was then ashed prior to determination of \ntotal U and Th concentrations.  \nAll samples were finely powdered prior to analyses to determine total U and Th \nactivity concentrations. Where available, 0.5 g of sample was digested with 10 ml of \nconcentrated HNO3 and 2 drops of HF in a microwave oven, dried down and taken up \nso that the final digest was in 10 ml of 10% HNO3. Samples were analysed using ICP-\nMS (detection limits for samples analysed were typically of the order 10\n-2\n mg kg\n-1\n FW \nfor Th and 10\n-3\n mg kg\n-1\n FW for U). Specific activities of 4.07 Bq \n232\nTh mg\n-1\n Th  and \n12.21 Bq \n238\nU mg\n-1\n U respectively were used to estimate radionuclide activity \nconcentrations from total U and Th determinations. An assumption of secular \nequilibrium between \n238\nU and \n234\nU would appear to be valid for biological samples (see \ndata presented by Eisenbud and Gessel, 1997) enabling \n234\nU activity concentrations to \nbe estimated. Equilibrium between the parents and other members of the two decay \nchains could not be assumed for biological samples because of differing environmental \nand biological behaviours. \n2.4 Derivation of soil activity concentrations \nFor over 35 years the British Geological Survey (BGS) have been conducting \ngeochemical surveys of the UK. This work (referred to as the G-BASE project (Johnson \nand Breward, 2004; Johnson, 2005)) includes determinations of K, U and Th \nconcentrations in soils. The estimates of \n40\nK, \n238\nU and \n232\nTh series radionuclides in soils \nin England and Wales have been based upon this extensive data source supplemented \nwith data from other BGS projects. The derivations of soil activity concentrations are \nbriefly described here; full details can be found in Beresford et al. (2007b) (which also \ndescribes derivation of stream sediment and water activity concentrations using data \nfrom the G-BASE project). \nThe G-BASE sampling procedures are detailed in Johnson et al. (2005). Soil \nsamples are collected at an optimum density of one every 2 km\n2\n; each sample represents \na composite of material taken from five holes distributed within an area of \napproximately 20 m x 20 m. The extent of available data is illustrated for K in Figure 1; \ncoverage for K is similar to that for U and slightly better than that for Th (the total \nnumber of samples which have been analysed is: K \u2013 28694, U \u2013 33627, Th - 24567).  \nAs the G-BASE survey has been on-going for many years there have been \nchanges in both analytical procedures and sampling (either surface (5-20 cm) or \nsubsurface (35-50 cm) soils have been analysed in different areas). Both these issues \nhave required the database to be normalised for the purposes of this work. This \nprocess is fully described in Beresford et al. (2007b).  Where data existed for both \nsurface and subsurface soils the values were compared. This demonstrated a good \nlinear relationship between surface and subsurface K data (R\n2\n=0.67), the subsurface \nvalues being generally higher and the regression between the two was used to convert \nthe surface soils to equivalent subsurface values where needed. For U data the two \n 7 \nvalues were so close to a 1:1 relationship that the data could be combined without \ntransformation. In the case of Th there was a lack of appropriate data for comparison. \nAs a result, we did not feel that transformation of the Th data was justified and it was \nassumed that, as for U, Th concentrations were essentially comparable at both depths. \nAs can be seen in Figure 1 coverage of England and Wales by the G-BASE \nsurvey is not yet complete. To provide a more complete coverage geological \nextrapolation utilising the strong link between soil geochemistry and geology was \napplied. Simplified bedrock and superficial geology codes based on BGS 1: 50 000 \nscale digital geological maps (see Appleton, 2005) were attributed to each soil \nsample location. Geometric means for each element were calculated for each 1 km \ngrid square and parent material (bedrock plus superficial geology) polygon from the \nnearest 5 soil sample values for that parent. These data were then used to compute \ngeometric means for each 25 km\n2 \n(5 x 5 km) grid square using area-weighted \ngeometric mean values for each parent material found in the square (Figure 1 \npresents data on this basis). This involved summing the products of the mean element \ncontent for each 1 km grid square\/parent material polygon (derived from the 5 nearest \ndata points on that parent material) and the area of that polygon and dividing the sum \nof those products by the total area of the 25 km\n2 \ngrid\n \nsquare:  \nGM5km =\nn\nn\nkm\nnAreaXAreaXAreaX\n1\n2\n2211\n25\n)...()()(\n \nWhere X  is the geometric mean (GM) for a 1 km grid square\/parent material \npolygon. \nFigure 2 presents an example (Th) of the resultant extrapolated surface. Specific \nactivities of \n40\nK, \n232\nTh and \n238\nU of 31.6 Bq g\n-1\n K, 4.07 Bq mg\n-1\n Th and 12.21 Bq mg\n-1\n \nU respectively were used to estimate the activity concentrations of the three \nradionuclides in soil from stable element concentrations.  \n \n3. Results \n3.1 Biota \nPotassium-40 was detectable in the majority of samples. The activity \nconcentrations of \n238\nU and \n232\nTh series gamma-emitting radionuclides were generally \nbelow detection limits (typically of the order 10\n2\n Bq kg\n-1\n for isotopes of interest) or had \nlarge analytical errors. Consequently, these results and have not been used in the \nsubsequent analyses presented below (N.B. all data identified within the initial data \nreview stage of this work had been determined by radiochemical separation and \nsubsequent alpha-spectroscopy). Approximately 50% of the 75 samples analysed by \nICP-MS had total U concentrations in excess of detection limits; only 20 % of samples \nhad measurable total Th concentrations. \nTable 3 summarises activity concentrations of naturally occurring radionuclides in \nbiota in the United Kingdom, combining data from the literature review with those \nobtained during this study. The data are presented as fresh weight (FW) whole-body \nactivity concentrations as these are required for subsequent dose estimations. Some of \nthe compiled data were for specific tissues (e.g. much of the collated data were available \n 8 \nfor tissues relevant to the human foodchain) rather than whole-body. To estimate whole-\nbody activity concentrations from tissue-specific values, the assumptions used to derive \ndefault transfer databases for the ERICA Tool (see Beresford et al., this issue) were used \nas described below.  \nPotassium is relatively uniformly distributed within organisms and tissue specific \n40\nK values can therefore be taken to be representative of whole-body activity \nconcentrations. To convert \n210\nPb and \n210\nPo activity concentrations reported in the meat \nof mammals it was been assumed that: meat concentrations are representative of all soft-\ntissues; soft tissues comprise 90 % of whole-body live-weight; and 10 % and 40 % of \nthe whole-body burdens of Pb and Po respectively will be in soft tissues. Activity \nconcentrations of U and Th isotopes in meat are assumed to be representative of whole-\nbody concentrations. There was no relationship between either Th or U concentrations \nin the liver of ducks analysed within this study and those in the remainder of the carcass. \nTherefore, concentrations determined in the liver of heron samples were taken to be \nrepresentative of whole-body concentrations. A dry matter content of 25% was assumed \nto convert collated dry matter activity concentrations in both flying insects and plant \nmaterials to fresh weight values; for all other dry or ash to fresh weight conversion \nsample specific measurements were available. To estimate the mean values presented in \nTable 3, a value of half the minimum detectable activity was assumed for those samples \ndetermined to below detection limits. \nThe most abundant data are for \n40\nK followed by \n232\nTh, \n234\nU and \n238\nU (Table 3); \nthere are relatively few data for \n210\nPb, \n210\nPo and \n226\nRa for some RAPs.   \nEstimated uranium isotopes and \n232\nTh activity concentrations are comparatively \nhigh in earthworms compared to the other animals considered. This may be the \nconsequence of residual soil within the gut. The summary values for Wild Grass in \nTable 3 do not include data from the vicinity of the Springfields plant (north-west \nEngland) which manufactures reactor fuel elements and produces uranium hexafluoride. \nUranium-234 and \n238\nU activity concentrations in grass samples from around \nSpringfields (EA, 2003) were up to 50 Bq kg\n-1 \n(FW) (i.e. approximately two-orders of \nmagnitude greater than the mean of the remaining data). Because of the nature of the \navailable data many are from monitoring activities close to sites discharging \nradionuclides. The database was inspected to investigate if sites other than Springfields \nskew the data, but no evidence of this was found. \n3.2 Soil \nTable 4 presents a summary of \n40\nK, \n238\nU and \n232\nTh soil activity concentrations in \nEngland and Wales. The summary statistics are for all of the 25 km\n2\n grid squares for \nwhich we have predicted values (circa 6200 depending on the extent of coverage for \neach element). Where values based on data are available these have been used to derive \nthe summary values, otherwise predictions from the geological interpolation described \nabove have been used. \n \n4. Estimation of dose rates \nTo estimate the exposure of the selected organisms to naturally occurring \nradionuclides in England and Wales, the probabilistic routines within the ERICA Tool \nwere used (Brown et al., this issue). Dimensions for RAPs have been proposed for \n 9 \nphantom dose modelling assuming solid ellipsoids (ICRP, 2005). The ERICA Tool \nincludes dose conversion coefficients (DCCs) for geometries corresponding to adult \nstages of all of the ICRP\u2019s proposed RAPs. The DCCs relate whole-body activity \nconcentrations in biota, or media (soil in the case of terrestrial assessments), to absorbed \ndose (\u03bcGy h-1 \/ Bq kg-1 fresh weight) (see Ulanovsky et al., this issue for description of \nthe derivation of DCC values). Daughter products with a physical half-life of less than \n10 days are assumed to be in secular equilibrium with the parent radionuclide (e.g. the \nDCC for \n228\nTh includes contributions from \n222\nRn, \n218\nPo, \n214\nPb, \n214\nBi and \n214\nPo (see Table \n1) and inputs for these short-lived radionuclides are not required).  \nIn the case of \n238\nU series radionuclides it can be assumed that activity \nconcentrations of \n234\nU, and the intervening decay products (see Table 1), are in \nequilibrium with those of \n238\nU in soils to provide estimates of soil activity \nconcentrations. Thereafter, assumptions of equilibrium may not be valid because of \nthe different chemical properties and environmental behaviours of the different \nelements. Consequently in order to be able to conduct a complete assessment of dose \nrates activity concentrations of \n230\nTh, \n226\nRa, \n210\nPb and \n210\nPo needed to be derived.  A \nlimited number of values (n=18-80 depending upon radionuclide) are available for \nUK soils from predominantly routine monitoring data (Green et al., 2002; Ham et al., \n1998; MAFF, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996; MAFF and SEPA, 1997, 1998, 1999; FSA \nand SEPA, 2000, 2001, 2002; EA et al., 2003, 2004, 2005). As some of these data are \nreported with values for \n238\nU, it was possible to estimate ratios of the four \nradionuclides to \n238\nU of: 1.5 for \n230\nTh, 1.3 for \n226\nRa, 2.0 for \n210\nPb and 1.9 for \n210\nPo. \nThese ratios have been used to estimate soil activity concentrations in England and \nWales for the four radionuclides from the \n238\nU values we have derived (values are \npresented in Table 4). All \n232\nTh series radionuclides are likely to be in approximate \nequilibrium (Olley et al., 1996). \nTo enable probabilistic estimation of dose rates using the ERICA Tool the mean \nand standard deviations as presented in Tables 3 and 4 were entered for biota and soil \nactivity concentrations respectively; log-normal distributions were assumed for all \ninput data. It was assumed that the dry matter content of soil was 100 % as \ninformation on soil moisture content was not available from G-BASE. If activity \nconcentrations for a given organism-radionuclide were not available they were \nestimated from input soil concentrations using the ERICA Tool\u2019s default transfer \nparameters. The ERICA Tool uses concentration ratios, defined as the ratio of the \nwhole-body activity concentration (Bq kg\n-1\n fresh weight) to the activity concentration \nin soil (Bq kg\n-1\n dry weight) to estimate activity concentrations in biota if data are \nunavailable (see Beresford et al., this issue). As data were limited for Frog (one \nsample only), whole-body activity concentrations were estimated from soil \nconcentrations; the ERICA Tool does not contain transfer values for \n40\nK hence the \nsame activity concentration as for Duck (Table 3) was assumed (this being the \nhighest of the two available mean values for vertebrate RAPs). Given the lack of data \nspecific to the proposed RAPs Deer and Rat, data for all terrestrial mammals \n(predominantly rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus)) were used for both organisms. \nBoth unweighted and weighted absorbed whole-body dose rates have been \nestimated, weighted values were derived using the default radiation weighting factors \nprovided in the ERICA Tool of 3 and 10 for low beta and alpha radiations \nrespectively. For the purpose of estimating external dose rates it was assumed that: \n 10 \nEarthworms spend 100 % of their time in soil; Rat and Frog spend 50 % of their time \nin soil and 50% on the soil surface; all other animals spend 100 % of their time on the \nsoil surface. Tables 5-7 present estimated external, weighted internal and unweighted \ninternal, absorbed doses rates for each RAP-radionuclide combination; Table 8 \ncompares total weighted and unweighted absorbed dose rates for each RAP.  \nFor all organisms \n40\nK, \n226\nRa, \n228\nTh and \n228\nRa (in descending order) dominated \nthe external dose rates (Table 5); dose rates from the other radionuclides were \ntypically at least two orders of magnitude lower than from these four. In the case of \nthe animal RAPs, external dose rates were highest, although of the same order, for \nthose organisms modelled as spending some time underground (Earthworm, Rat and \nFrog).  \nPotassium-40 was consistently one of the most important contributors to \ninternal absorbed dose rates (Table 6). Variation in the relative contribution of other \nradionuclides appeared to be dependent on the origin of the biota activity \nconcentrations used in the dose assessment, (i.e. if actual whole-body activity \nconcentration had been used or if activity concentrations had been estimated using \nthe ERICA Tool default concentration ratios (indicated on Table 6)). This is most \nnoticeable for \n226\nRa which was predicted to be a major contributor to the internal \ndose for Duck, Frog, Bee and Earthworm based on whole-body activity \nconcentrations estimated using concentration ratios. For Rat and Deer, for which data \nwere available (Table 3), the estimated dose rates due to \n226\nRa were more than one-\norder of magnitude lower than those estimated for \n40\nK. For some organisms \n228\nTh \nwas predicted to be the major contributor to internal weighted dose rate, all \ncalculations for this radionuclide were based on whole-body activity concentrations \nestimated using the ERICA Tool default concentration ratios. Weighted internal dose \nrates to Earthworms estimated from U-isotopes were comparatively high compared to \nmost other RAPs.  \nThe estimated unweighted absorbed whole-body dose rates (Table 7) resulting \nfrom those radionuclides with \u03b1-emissions (see Table 1) were approximately an order \nof magnitude lower than the weighted dose rate estimates (Table 6). This difference \nwas to be expected given that an \u03b1-radiation weighting factor of 10 was used to \nestimate the weighted dose rates. \n \n5. Discussion \n5.1 Soil activity concentrations  \nThe concentrations of naturally occurring radionuclides determined from the G-\nBASE dataset (Table 4) are in agreement with more limited datasets available for \nEngland and Wales (Green et al., 2002; Ham et al., 1998; MAFF, 1996; MAFF and \nSEPA, 1997, 1998, 1999; FSA and SEPA, 2000, 2001, 2002; EA et al., 2003, 2004, \n2005). The comprehensive geospatial datasets derived here for soil activity \nconcentrations in England and Wales are within the ranges of reported values for other \nEuropean countries (The Radiation Protection Authorities in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, \nNorway and Sweden, 2000; Anagnostakis et al., 2005; UNSCEAR, 2000; Uyttenhove, \n2005). For instance, data presented in UNSCEAR (2000) for European soils gives \nmedian activity concentrations of: 465 Bq \n40\nK kg\n-1\n, 32 Bq \n238\nU kg\n-1\n, 34 Bq \n226\nRa kg\n-1\n \n 11 \nand 30 Bq \n232\nTh kg\n-1\n(UNSCEAR present fresh weight activity concentrations assuming \nan 81 % dry matter content of soil). However, the extremes of ranges reported in most \nlarge scale surveys are greater than reported here for England and Wales. This will, to a \nlarge extent, be a consequence of using spatial averaging over 5x5 km\n2\n rather than \nresults for individual sample points. \nActivity concentrations of \n230\nTh, \n226\nRa, \n210\nPb and \n210\nPo had to be estimated using \nrelatively small datasets to define ratios of the isotopes to \n238\nU in UK soils. \nConsequently, there is a greater uncertainty associated with these estimates than for the \nother radionuclides. However, as noted above the estimated values appear to be realistic \ncompared to other data available for the UK and Europe. \n5.2 Estimated dose rates \nThe external dose rates presented in this paper are likely to be conservative as a \nconsequence of having assumed 100% dry matter content for soil. However, the impact \nof this on the overall estimate of total absorbed dose rate is unlikely to be large because \nthe assumption of 100% dry matter content for soil will only affect the calculation of \nexternal dose rates. The input parameter for the ERICA Tool is soil dry weight activity \nconcentrations and the concentration ratios used within the Tool relate dry weight \nactivity concentrations in soil to fresh weight activity concentrations in biota.  As a \nresult, the whole-body activity concentrations estimated using the ERICA Tool and \nresultant internal dose rates will not be overestimated. \nThe mean total weighted whole-body absorbed dose rate estimated for selected \nterrestrial organisms was in the range 6.9x10\n-2\n to 6.1x10\n-1\n \u00b5Gy h\n-1\n (Table 8). This is at \nleast an order of magnitude lower than any benchmark dose rate currently being used in \nenvironmental assessments (Hingston et al., 2007).  They are however, similar to dose \nrates estimated in an assessment of a terrestrial ecosystem close to the Sellafield \nreprocessing plant (Wood et al., this issue). \nUranium isotopes and \n232\nTh activity concentrations determined in earthworms \nwere comparatively high (Table 3) resulting in the highest internal dose rates estimated \nfor any RAP for these radionuclides (Tables 7-8). This may have been the consequence \nof residual soil within the gut. Similarly, it is likely that a component of the activity \nconcentrations reported for both plant RAPs will have been associated with external \ncontamination (a number of the radionuclides considered have low soil-plant transfers \nand adherent soil is likely to contribute to the measured activity concentration). \nAs noted above, the contributions of \n226\nRa and \n228\nTh to the estimated internal \ndose rate appear to be comparatively high for some organisms when whole-body \nactivity concentrations are calculated using the ERICA Tool concentration ratios. \nEstimated dose rates for those organisms for which data are available for \n226\nRa \nappear to indicate that some of the higher estimates for other organisms are likely to \nbe overestimated (\n226\nRa is a relatively minor contributor to the total internal dose rate \nestimated for both mammal RAPs for which data are available). The majority of the \ndefault concentration ratios available in the ERICA Tool for radionuclides of U, Th \nand Ra either originate from studies in North America or the former Soviet Union, or \nare based upon a guidance methodology used to select default values when specific \norganism-radionuclide concentration ratios are not available (see Beresford et al. (this \nissue) for details). \n 12 \nAs yet there is no consensus on radiation weighting factors to apply for \nassessments of biota. A comparison of unweighted dose rates with those estimated using \na weighting factor for \u03b1-emissions of 10 (Table 8) gives an indication of the influence of \nthe weighting factor used to the overall dose rate predicted.   \nA potential route of exposure we have not considered is inhalation of \n222\nRn by \nburrowing animals. Macdonald and Laverlock (1998) suggest that dose rates to the lung \nof burrowing animals may be in excess of 57 \u00b5Gy h\n-1\n in southeastern Manitoba \n(Canada). The soil gas concentrations these authors quote are in the range of those \nreported for typical soils in some European countries (The Radiation Protection \nAuthorities in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden, 2000). \n5.3 Applicability of data to European terrestrial ecosystems \nAs noted above the ERICA Tool contains data derived from the initial report of \nthis work (Beresford et al., 2007b) to enable users to put results of their assessments of \nanthropogenic activities into context with natural exposure rates (Brown et al., this \nissue). We therefore need to consider if these data derived for the United Kingdom are \nof value for assessments in Europe. \nThere is an acknowledged lack of data for naturally occurring radionuclides and \nterrestrial wildlife (e.g. Jones et al., 2003) especially from ecosystems subject to typical \nexposure rates (i.e. not the result of studies of sites impacted as a result of (e.g.) uranium \nmining activities). Given that potassium is an essential element under homeostatic \ncontrol, the \n40\nK activity concentrations reported here should be similar to other areas \nwithin Europe. Similarly, as the soil activity concentrations for \n238\nU and \n232\nTh series \nradionuclides estimated here for England and Wales are broadly comparable to those of \nother European countries it could be anticipated that whole-body activity concentrations \n(and consequently estimated absorbed dose rates) may be generally applicable to most \nof Europe. An exception may be reindeer which can ingest lichen with comparatively \nhigh concentrations of \n210\nPo and \n210\nPb (G\u00f3mez-Ros et al., 2004; Beresford et al., this \nissue). However, if assessments of this species were required, data tend to be available \n(e.g. Beresford et al., 2005).  Given the lack of other data, the data presented here should \ngive an indicative estimate of natural background exposure to wildlife in most European \ncountries with the exception of those areas known to have enhanced levels of naturally \noccurring radionuclides.   It is however worth noting that much of the data compiled \nhere for wildlife in the United Kingdom originated in the grey literature (e.g. routine \nmonitoring reports); it is possible that data for other European countries exists in similar \npublications. \nThe absorbed dose rates reported in Beresford et al. (2007b) and currently \n(December 2007) quoted within the ERICA Tool as typical of terrestrial ecosystems are \nnot the same as those reported here. The earlier work did not estimate absorbed dose \nrates probabilistically and reported values are averages for different administrative areas \nof England and Wales. Furthermore, dose rate estimates were based upon available biota \nactivity concentrations (i.e. concentration ratios and soil activity concentrations were not \nused to provide missing values) and soil activity concentrations for \n40\nK and those \nradionuclides of the \n238\nU and \n232\nTh series which could be considered in equilibrium with \nthe series parent (i.e. soil concentrations of \n210\nPb, \n210\nPo, \n230\nTh, or \n226\nRa were not \nestimated). We recommend that, if the ERICA Tool is to continue to rely upon this work \n(at the moment there appears to be little alternative) to provide estimates of natural \n 13 \nexposure rates to wildlife, the existing values are replaced with those reported here. \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThis work described in this paper was largely funded by the England and Wales \nEnvironment Agency (Science Project Number SC030283).
