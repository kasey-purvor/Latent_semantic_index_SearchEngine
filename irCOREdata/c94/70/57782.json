The affect of temperature on invertebrate \nmitochondria is essentially unknown.  A comparison of two articulate brachiopod species, Liothyrella \nuva collected from Rothera Station, Antarctic in summer 2007, and Liothyrella neozelanica from \nFiordland New Zealand collected in winter 2007 and summer 2008, revealed a higher Vv(mt,mf) in the \nAntarctic brachiopod.  The Sv(im,mt) was however, significantly lower, indicating the Antarctic \nbrachiopods have more less reactive, mitochondria.  Liothyrella uva, from the colder environment, had \nlarger adductor muscles in both absolute and relative terms than the temperate L. neozelanica.  \nFurthermore, a seasonal comparison (winter Vs. summer) in L. neozelanica showed that the absolute \nand relative size of the adductor increased in winter, Vv(mt,mf) was unchanged, however Sv(im,mt) \nwas significantly increased.  Thus, seasonal acclimatization to the cold resulted in the same number of \nmore reactive mitochondria.  Liothyrella neozelanica was clearly able to adapt to seasonal changes \nusing a different mechanism, i.e. primarily through regulation of cristae surface area as opposed to \nmitochondrial volume density.    Furthermore, given the evolutionary age of these living fossils (i.e. \napproximately 550 million years), this suggests that mitochondrial plasticity has roots that extend far \nback into evolutionary history. \n \n \n \n \nDear Sir \n \nFirstly, thank you very much for your positive reply regarding our manuscript \n\u201cMitochondrial plasticity in brachiopod (Liothyrella sp.) smooth adductor muscle as a \nresult of season and latitude\u201d (MABI-D-09-00514).  We have carefully read through \nyour and the reviewer\u2019s comments on our manuscript and considered them \naccordingly.  Below is our response to some of the points made. \n \nTo date, mitochondrial cold proliferation has only been described in one group of \nectotherms, fish.  As such, this is the logical departure point for this study.  Our study \nis the first to look at mitochondrial characteristics as a function of temperature in \ninvertebrates in both a long-term (adaptational) and short-term (seasonal) sense.  \nTherefore we are forced to compare our data with those from fish as there are no other \ndata to compare with.  Nevertheless, we do agree that fishes and brachiopods are \nvastly different animals, and any comparison has its\u2019 limitations.  Consequently we \nhave reined in our discussion and eliminated many of the comparisons with fish, \nexcept where we think appropriate. \n \nThe section regarding the two different forms of mitochondrial plasticity has also \nbeen condensed and is hopefully less convoluted as a result. \n \nSpring, i.e. September to November, is the time of the largest planktonic bloom in \nDoubtful Sound as indicated by the greatest chlorophyll concentrations (Goebel, \n2005), however there is a second, smaller bloom that usually occurs between January \nand March, which was the time we collected our brachiopods. \n \nFigures 2A and B are now supplemental figures and the data from figures 3-6 are \npresented in two tables. \n \nAll other comments have been duly noted and the manuscript changed accordingly. \n \nReviewer 2 raised a valid concern with respect to scaling of organs in brachiopods.  \nEvidence from mammals indicates that the relationship between muscle\/organ mass \nand size is isometric (Hoppeler & Weibel 2000, Acta Phys Scan 168, 445-56, Mathieu \net al 1981, Resp Physiol 41, 113-125).  Obviously, extending this directly to \nbrachiopods would be tenuous at best, and we concede that the relationship between \nthe length of the brachiopods and the adductor muscle wet weight may not necessarily \nbe isometric.  But in the absence of any data of our own, or in the literature on organ \nscaling in invertebrates, we feel that our attempt to correct for size effects is valid.  \nDeriving scaling exponents from our data are precluded, primarily by the very narrow \nsize range we used in order to avoid this problem, i.e. 37-54mm for L. neozelanica.  \nFurthermore, we consider the differences seen here to be of sufficient magnitude (i.e. \na 27% larger absolute muscle mass in brachiopods that are 16% smaller) to \nsufficiently qualify as evidence of cold-induced muscular hypertrophy.  Nevertheless, \nwe have reined in our speculative discussion in accordance with reviewer 2\u2019s wishes.  \n \nWe do not have data for other tissues as this was not the focus of the study.  As a \nconsequence, we are not able to give a condition index.  We do not think this would \nhave any major impact on our findings.  As pointed out in the discussion, if \nauthors' response to reviewers' comments\nClick here to download authors' response to reviewers' comments: Reviewer_Response.doc\ncondition\/nutritional state were to have an effect, it would be much more likely to be \nseen in the digestive organs than the adductor muscle. \n \nReviewer 2\u2019s specific comments: \n1) The referee is correct in that these brachiopods do lay down stored reserves in the \nsummer and convert these to cell division and increase in structural materials in \nwinter.  However, unlike many other groups (that do store lipids and carbohydrates), \nthese stores are proteins or glycoproteins (James et al 1992), and thus, although they \nare almost certainly transformed form storage to structural, they are not transformed \nfrom lipids and CHO to protein.  Liothyrella uva increases in shell length in the \nwinter more than the summer (about 4 times as much growth in winter than summer, \n(Peck et al 1997, Phil Trans R. Soc 352, 851-858), and this cycle in increase in linear \ndimension occurs completely out of phase with changes in mass. \n \nHopefully we have made this clearer with the following alteration in the third \nparagraph of the discussion: Secondly, although the quantity of food in winter is \ndrastically reduced, such that it is insufficient to met the basal metabolic requirements \n(Peck et al. 1987), the unchanged basal metabolic rate indicates that L. uva decouple \ngrowth from feeding, growing in size in winter on stored protein\/glycoprotein \nreserves from summer (Peck et al. 1989, James et al. 1992), i.e. total animal mass is \nconverted into increased size (Peck et al. 1997). \n \n2) Although evidence in mammals indicates that there is a direct linear relationship \nbetween mitochondrial volume density and oxygen consumption (Mathieu et al 1981, \nResp Physiol 41, 113-125), we are aware that there may not necessarily be a linear \nrelationship between volume density, cristae surface density and the myocyte aerobic \ncapacity in brachiopods.  Our simple assertion is that if either volume density or \ncristae surface density increase then an increase in the myocyte aerobic capacity will \nfollow. \n \n3) Giving the mitochondrial volume (\u00b5m\n3\n) is essential as this is a parameter that could \naffect not only the aerobic capacity of the muscle, but ultimately the respiration rate \nof the whole animal.  This parameter demonstrates that although the winter \nbrachiopods were smaller, they had larger adductor muscles.  A larger muscle mass \nmeans they had more mitochondria, which would have an affect on the metabolic rate.  \nThis is a fact that has no dependence on whether the increase in adductor weight \nscales isometrically, or was the result of cold induced hypertrophy. \n \n4) Through shortening and condensing the discussion we were able to reduce the \nnumber of references from 55 to 38. \n \n5) The discussion has also been shortened by halving the section on hypertrophy to \none paragraph.  Nevertheless we still think it is important to point out the significance \nof the differences in shell length and adductor muscle wet weight between the \nanimals, and that if not conclusive evidence, then it is very suggestive of cold-induced \nhypertrophy. \n \nWe hope you consider our remarks favourably.  I look forward to another speedy and \npositive reply, and the possibility of publishing in your illustrious journal. \n \nYours sincerely \nGlenn Lurman \n \nMitochondrial plasticity in brachiopod (Liothyrella sp.) smooth adductor muscle as a \nresult of season and latitude. \n \nGlenn J.

The affect of temperature on \ninvertebrate mitochondria is essentially unknown.  A comparison of two articulate brachiopod \nspecies, Liothyrella uva collected from Rothera Station, Antarctic in summer 2007, and \nLiothyrella neozelanica from Fiordland New Zealand collected in winter 2007 and summer \n2008, revealed a higher Vv(mt,mf) in the Antarctic brachiopod.  The Sv(im,mt) was however, \nsignificantly lower, indicating the Antarctic brachiopods have more less reactive, \nmitochondria.  Liothyrella uva, from the colder environment, had larger adductor muscles in \nboth absolute and relative terms than the temperate L. neozelanica.  Furthermore, a seasonal \ncomparison (winter Vs. summer) in L. neozelanica showed that the absolute and relative size \nof the adductor increased in winter, Vv(mt,mf) was unchanged, however Sv(im,mt) was \nsignificantly increased.  Thus, seasonal acclimatization to the cold resulted in the same \nnumber of more reactive mitochondria.  Liothyrella neozelanica was clearly able to adapt to \nseasonal changes using a different mechanism, i.e. primarily through regulation of cristae \nsurface area as opposed to mitochondrial volume density.    Furthermore, given the \nevolutionary age of these living fossils (i.e. approximately 550 million years), this suggests \nthat mitochondrial plasticity has roots that extend far back into evolutionary history. \n \nIntroduction \n \nTemperature has significant effects on the physiology of ectotherms and is often seen as a \nmaster regulator affecting the whole animal on a number of levels including muscle function.  \nMuscle is a highly plastic tissue and a host of compensatory mechanisms on a number of \nlevels ranging from molecular through to organelles are employed to maintain function \n(Egginton and Sidell 1989; Johnston 1993; S\u00e4nger 1993; Watabe 2002).  In fish, mitochondria \nare subject to reductions in efficiency as temperature decreases because increased unsaturated \nfatty acids, are needed to maintain mitochondrial membrane fluidity at low temperatures \n(Logue et al. 2000; Guderley 2004b), which leads to increased proton leak across the \nmembrane (Brand et al. 1991; Guderley 2004a).  The thermodynamic effects of reduced \ntemperature also lead to a reduction in enzyme activity (S\u00e4nger 1993; Guderley 2004b). \nCompensatory mechanisms include improved catalytic efficiency by the expression of \n 3 \ndifferent enzyme isoforms (Crockett and Sidell 1990; Guderley 2004b), increasing the \nmitochondrial volume density (S\u00e4nger 1993; Johnston et al. 1998) and in one study, the \nmitochondrial cristae surface density, i.e. the \u201camount\u201d of cristae packed within a \nmitochondrion also increased in the cold (St-Pierre et al. 1998). \nAlthough this is well characterised in fish, it is largely unknown whether the effects \nand mechanisms are the same in invertebrates.  At best, only a handful of studies exist that \nhave looked at the effects of temperature on mitochondrial plasticity in invertebrates.  One \nlaboratory based study looked at mitochondrial density in different populations of the same \nspecies of marine mud worm (Arenicola marina) from different latitudes, i.e. the North Sea \nand the White Sea in response to thermal acclimation.  An increase of 2.4-fold was found in \nthe mitochondrial volume density in the White Sea A. marina compared to the North Sea A. \nmarina (Sommer and P\u00f6rtner 2002).  The cristae surface density was not measured in their \nstudy and is seldom measured in the majority of studies concerning temperature. Therefore \nthe possibility that annelids also increase the cristae surface density in their mitochondria in \nthe cold cannot be excluded. \nMore recent work has investigated mitochondrial volume density in the Antarctic \nlimpet Nacella concinna from different latitudes within the Southern Ocean (Morley et al. \n2009).  There was evidence of mitochondrial plasticity in the foot muscle. However, there was \nno evidence for the expected change in mitochondrial volume density and the key response \nreported was through a change in mitochondrial cristae surface area (Morley et al. 2009).  \nWhile the results of this study are interesting, in particular because they demonstrated that \neven stenothermal Antarctic invertebrates can exhibit a certain degree of mitochondrial \nplasticity, they are limited precisely because they come from a stenothermal invertebrates \n(although it can be argued that being intertidal, N. concinna are one of the more eurythermal \nAntarctic invertebrates). \nTo see whether the paradigm of mitochondrial plasticity in response to temperature \nchange is applicable to an even broader group of invertebrates, a completely different animal \nphylum was selected, the Brachiopoda.  Furthermore, the present study provided the \nopportunity to investigate whether these invertebrates are capable of adaptation on both \nevolutionary and\/or seasonal scales.  This was possible because two species from the same \ngenus, Liothyrella uva from the Antarctic Peninsula and Liothyrella neozelanica from \nFiordland, New Zealand were studied.  Articulate brachiopods such as Liothyrella are filter \nfeeders predominantly living off phytoplankton (Rhodes & Thayer 1991, Peck et al. 2005).  \nThey are traditionally described as common in polar regions, the deep sea and fiordic \n 4 \nenvironments (James et al. 1992).  In Fiordland, New Zealand, they occur at depths of 15-50 \nm.  Liothyrella neozelanica experience a broad range of temperatures in Fiordland, where \nwinter temperatures may drop to 9\u00b0C and summer maxima climb to 18\u00b0C, although this varies \nwith depth, and there is even greater variation close to the surface (Cornelisen and Goodwin \n2008).  The Antarctic L. uva near Rothera, on the other hand, experience very stable but \nextremely cold seawater temperatures of -1.8 - +1.0\u00b0C. \n \nMethods \n \nSpecimen Collection \n \nAntarctic Liothyrella uva (Fig. 1) were collected by SCUBA diving near Rothera Station, \nAdelaide Island (67\u00b034.25\u2019S, 68\u00b008.00\u2019W) from 20 m depth in February 2007 (N = 8).  \nBrachiopods were then transported back to the UK where they were held for 3 months in a re-\ncirculating seawater aquarium maintained at 0\u00b0C and a 16:8 light:dark photoperiod. \nBiological filtration and regular water changes maintained seawater quality whilst the addition \nof an algal solution (Nannochloropsis, Instant Algae \u00ae) supplemented the natural food in the \nseawater. \nTemperate Liothyrella neozelanica (Fig. 1) were collected by SCUBA divers also \nfrom approximately 20-30 m depth in Doubtful Sound, New Zealand (167\u00b002.91\u2019E, \n45\u00b020.92\u2019S).  Collections were made both in winter (July 2007, N=8) when the seawater \ntemperature was 11\u00b0C, and in summer (February 2008, N=8) when the water temperature was \n17\u00b0C.  Collected Liothyrella neozelanica were kept in a bucket of seawater for a maximum of \n2 hours before they could be prepared for tissue fixation on shore at the University of Otago \nDeep Cove field station in Doubtful Sound. \n \nBrachiopod Tissue preparation \n \nShell length was measured (\u00b10.01 mm) with vernier callipers and wet weight (\u00b10.01 g) were \ndetermined both when the mantle was full of seawater and when empty.  The anterior portions \nof both valves were cut away with scissors exposing the mantle cavity but leaving the \nmajority of the two valves, the hinge and consequently the muscles intact and attached to both \nvalves.  This allowed in situ fixation of all muscles at their normal contracted length.  \nBrachiopods were fixed for 24 hours in 3% glutaraldehyde containing 0.05 M PIPES pH 7.6, \n 5 \n0.3 mM calcium chloride, 7 mM sucrose and 0.77 mM sodium azide.  The osmolality was \nsimilar to that of seawater (800 mOsm kg\n-1\n).  After primary fixation, the brachiopods were \nwashed three times with, and stored for 5 weeks in the same solution as above, without the \nglutaraldehyde and sodium azide. \nSmooth adductor muscles were dissected free from their attachment points and care \nwas taken not to destroy the natural form.  Muscles were dried with tissue paper and weighed \n(\u00b1 2 mg) and then weighed again in fixative to determine the tissue density (1.018).  Care was \nagain taken to ensure the tissue did not dry out significantly.  Drying and weighing took \napproximately 15-20 sec.  Muscles were secondary fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide for 2 hrs, \nwashed 3 times in the same storage buffer used above and left overnight.  They were bulk \nstained in 0.05 M maleate buffered (pH 5.2) uranyl acetate for 2 hrs.  Muscles were then \nserially dehydrated in 70, 90 and 100% ethanol solutions before being embedded in Quetol \n651 and cured at 60\u00b0C for 48hrs (Ellis 2002).  Blocks were selected at random for semithin \n(0.5 \u00b5m) sectioning. One block, containing a whole adductor muscle was sectioned \ntransversely at approximately half the length of the adductor muscle using a Reichert \nultramicrotome.  Sections were stained with methylene blue.  Ultrathin sections (80 nm) were \nplaced on copper grids (200 mesh). Grids were then stained for 5 min in uranyl acetate \nsaturated 50% methanol and then for 5 min in lead citrate. \n \nMorphometry \n \nMethylene blue stained semi-thin sections were analysed using a Zeiss Axioskop at 100x \nmagnification fitted with an Olympus DP70 digital camera that was connected to a computer.  \nFrames were selected randomly by starting in the top left corner and sampling every 5th frame \nwith ten frames sampled, i.e. 250 myocytes.  The maximum cell diameter (\u00b5m) was \ndetermined to be the distance between the two most distant myocyte edges perpendicular to \nthe longitudinal axis of the cell and was measured using the arbitrary distance function in the \nOlympus DP software, version 3.2. \nThe relative mitochondrial volume density (Vv(mt,mf)), given as a proportion of muscle \nfibre volume, was determined was determined as per Morley et al. (2009).  Briefly, point \ncounting (Weibel 1979) at 4400x magnification on a Zeiss EM902 transmission electron \nmicroscope, with a 2.12 \u00b5m spaced 16 point grid was used. For each animal 120 fields of \nview were analysed (Supplemental Fig. 2).  Electron micrographs of individual mitochondria \n(8 to 15 per animal, Fig 2 supplementary material) at a magnification of 32000x were taken \n 6 \nfor the estimation of the surface density of the inner mitochondrial membrane (Sv(im, mt)), \nwhich was determined using line-intercept measurements (Weibel 1979).  Absolute \nmitochondrial volume (per adductor muscle) was calculated by multiplying the adductor \nmuscle weight by the proportion of mitochondria.  The absolute inner mitochondrial \nmembrane surface area (per adductor muscle) was calculated by multiplying the absolute \nmitochondrial volume by the relative surface area. \n \nStatistics \n \nStatistical analysis was performed using SigmaStat 3.5.  All data were checked for normality \nusing Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (with Lilliefor\u2019s correction) and equal variances.  For the \ndata were normal and had equal variances, a one-way ANOVAs were used to test for \nsignificant species effects, while post-hoc Holm-Sidak tests were used to determine \nsignificant between groups.  Normal data with unequal variances (i.e. absolute volume density \nand absolute cristae surface area) were tested for significance (without transformation) using a \nKruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA on ranks and Tukey tests to test for differences between \ngroups.  All values are given as the mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SE). \n \nResults \n \nSignificant differences existed between the sizes (measured as shell length) of the Liothyrella \nsampled (p < 0.05, F = 18.5, d.f. = 2). The Antarctic L. uva were smaller than L. neozelanica \nsampled in winter, and both of these were smaller than L. neozelanica sample collected in the \nsummer (Table 1).  Opposite to this, adductor wet weight was significantly greater in L. uva \nthan summer L. neozelanica (p< 0.05), while winter L. neozelanica was intermediary and not \nsignificantly different to either (Table 1).  As a consequence, there were significant difference \nbetween all groups in the adductor muscle wet weight relative to the size (p < 0.05, F = 12.3, \nd.f. = 2) of the brachiopod (Table 1), which declined from L. uva through winter L. \nneozelanica to the smallest ratio in summer L. neozelanica.  The Antarctic L. uva myocyte \ndiameter was 27% greater than winter L. neozelanica (p < 0.05) and 18% larger than summer \nL. neozelanica (p < 0.05).  No significant differences were seen between the diameter of \nmyocytes from winter or summer L. neozelanica, indicating no cellular hypertrophy as a \nresult of seasonal acclimatization (Table 1). \n 7 \n A significant difference was seen in the muscle fibre mitochondrial volume density (p \n< 0.05, F = 4.2, d.f. = 2), which was significantly higher in L. uva, than summer L. \nneozelanica (Table 2).  The winter L. neozelanica Vv(mt,mf) was intermediate between the two \nand not significantly different from either group, but much closer to the summer L. \nneozelanica value.  Absolute mitochondrial volume was also significantly different between \nthe groups (p < 0.05, H = 15.3, d.f. = 2), highest in L. uva and lowest in summer L. \nneozelanica. The winter L. neozelanica was again intermediate (Table 2).  This was due \nmainly to L. uva having larger adductor muscles than L. neozelanica, indicating increased \nmyocyte size in the cold (Table 1). \nThe cristae surface density differed significantly between groups (p < 0.05, F = 8.97, \nd.f. = 2).  Although Sv(im,mt) was approximately the same in L. uva and summer L. \nneozelanica, the winter L. neozelanica had significantly greater relative cristae density than \neither of these (Table 2).  The absolute cristae surface area was also significantly different \nbetween groups (p < 0.05, H = 11.7, d.f. = 2), with it being significantly higher in L. uva, than \nsummer L. neozelanica again due principally to the greater adductor muscle wet weight \n(Table 1), and intermediary in winter L. neozelanica (Table 2).  The surface area of \nmitochondrial cristae per unit muscle fibre volume can be used as an estimate of relative \naerobic capacity (see Johnston et al. 1998). This measure found no significant differences \nbetween the groups (p = 0.07, F = 3.0, d.f. = 2), i.e. it was similar to L. uva and winter L. \nneozelanica, but it tended to be lower (p = 0.06) in summer L. neozelanica (Table 2). \n \nDiscussion \n \nThe sizes of the brachiopods differed significantly between the groups studied here.  In the \nabsence of any data on the relationship between muscle size and shell size, differences were \ncorrected for using the adductor wet weight to shell length ratio.  On this measure the \nAntarctic L. uva had 21% larger adductor muscles than the winter L. neozelanica, although \nthey were 13% smaller.  This could be the result of cold-induced muscular hypertrophy or \nmechanical and\/or other species differences.  There was, however, an even greater seasonal \nchange in adductor muscle size in L. neozelanica, with summer specimens having 26% \nsmaller adductor muscles than winter samples although they were 16% larger.  The seasonal \nincrease in adductor wet weight observed here in L. neozelanica was due primarily to an \nincrease in the number of myocytes (cellular hyperplasia), as opposed to increased myocyte \nsize (cellular hypertrophy).  Although seasonal hypertrophy of muscle fibres in ectotherms \n 8 \nhas been investigated only rarely, for example in halibut (Haugen et al. 2006), cold-induced \nhypertrophy is not an entirely new phenomenon, having been previously documented in fish \nand mammals (Sidell 1980, Sidell and Moerland 1989).  Cold-induced hypertrophy \ncompensates for a reduction in the contraction rate at low temperatures by increasing the \nmuscle fibre number (Rome 1990). \nThe relative mitochondrial volume density in both L. uva and L. neozelanica was low \n(0.9-1.3%) compared to more active animals such as squid mantel muscle (50%, Moon and \nHulbert 1975), and fish red skeletal muscle (8-50%, Johnston et al. 1998).  It was in a similar \nrange to the volume density of mitochondria previously recorded in slower moving or sessile \ninvertebrates, e.g. 1.8-4.5% in polychaete body wall musculature (Arenicola marina, Sommer \nand P\u00f6rtner, 2002), 0.9-1.3% in scallops (Aequipecten opecularis, Philipp et al. 2008), and \n1.3-2.2% in limpets (Nacella concinna) and mud clams (Laternula elliptica, Morley et al. \n2009).  Analogous to previous findings in polychaete worms, the evidence suggests that con-\ngeneric brachiopods increase their mitochondrial volume density in response to the extreme \ncold of the Antarctic.  Whether this trend is consistent across the phylum Brachiopoda, \nremains to be examined.  Nevertheless, it seems reasonable to conclude that temperature is the \nprincipal factor affecting the mitochondrial density as these two species are from the same \ngenus, which eliminates many differences in phylogeny.  They share also essentially the same \nhabitat and lifestyle (Peck 2001). \nThe Antarctic L. uva shows only very small seasonal changes in basal metabolic rate \n(Peck et al. 1987).  However, feeding raises metabolic rate in this species by 1.6 fold (Peck \n1996), and this means summer L. uva might be expected to increase mitochondrial densities to \nmeet the extra activity costs associated with increased feeding. Several pieces of evidence \nargue against this.  First and foremost, any changes in mitochondrial volume density \nassociated with feeding would be expected to take place in the gut and digestive gland, not in \nmuscle.  Secondly, although the quantity of food in winter is drastically reduced, such that it \nis insufficient to met the basal metabolic requirements (Peck et al. 1987), the unchanged basal \nmetabolic rate indicates that L. uva decouple growth from feeding, growing in size in winter \non stored protein\/glycoprotein reserves from summer (Peck and Holmes 1989; James et al. \n1992), i.e. total animal mass is converted into increased animal size (Peck et al. 1997).  \nThirdly, applying the same principle that metabolic rate is up-regulated in the summer in \nresponse to enhanced food supply would mean that L. neozelanica, collected in the summer \nshould have higher densities as that is the primary time of feeding for this species too, as \nreflected by the higher chlorophyll concentrations seen in summer (Goebel et al. 2005).  \n 9 \nThere were, however, no differences seen in the density of winter and summer L. neozelanica.  \nThus, it is most likely that temperature is the primary determinant of mitochondrial volume \ndensity, only when comparing different Liothyrella species. \nEvidence of two different strategies for preserving similar myocyte aerobic capacities \nin the cold was evident in the current study.  Evolutionary adaptation of mitochondria to \nchanges in habitat temperature was marked by increased mitochondrial volume while the \namount of cristae packed within the mitochondria was maintained (L. uva Vs. L neozelanica).  \nSeasonal changes in habitat temperature were countered by increased cristae packing within \nthe mitochondria while the mitochondrial volume stayed the same.  The results concerning \nseasonal changes are similar to recent findings in the Antarctic limpet Nacella concinna \n(Morley et al. 2009).  In that study limpets acclimated to 0\u00b0C showed only minor changes in \nmitochondrial volume density compared to 3\u00b0C acclimated limpets.  However, significant \nchanges in the mitochondrial cristae surface density were observed in response to an \nacclimation difference of only 3\u00b0C (Morley et al. 2009).  The temperature difference in the \ncurrent study was twice as large, but still modest.  A larger temperature difference may reveal \neven greater differences in the cristae surface density, or indeed differences in the volume \ndensity. \nThe different forms of plasticity, i.e. volume density and cristae surface density, may \nhave different costs associated with them in the different thermal habitats.  Changes in cristae \nsurface density due to seasonal acclimatization in L. neozelanica may be a more efficient way \nof up-regulating the reactive surface for oxidative phosphorylation in individual mitochondria, \neliminating some of the costs associated with making mitochondria de novo.  Furthermore, \nthis strategy also prevents a loss in volume of the contractile apparatus if the size of the \nmyocytes is to stay the same, as indeed it appears to in L. neozelanica, analogous to the \noptimal fibre size hypothesis (Johnston et al. 2003).  The costs associated with this strategy \nmay be an increase in the basal energy requirements and an increase in the oxidative stress \nassociated with these more reactive mitochondria (Guderley 2004a). However, brachiopods \nhave been described as employing low energy, high efficiency energy utilisation strategies \n(James et al. 1992).  Changing cristae density may ultimately be a less costly mechanism than \nmitochondrial biogenesis. \nSimply increasing the number (i.e. volume density) of mitochondria, but not their \nreactive surface may mitigate oxidative stress problems, and this may be of importance in an \nanimal (L. uva) that inhabits an area of high ambient oxygen levels and recognised high \noxidative stress in some species (Abele and Puntarulo 2004).  Another hypothesis put forward \n 10 \nstates that mitochondrial proliferation in the cold may be the result of diffusional limitations \n(Sidell and Hazel 1987; Guderley 2004a; Kinsey et al. 2007).  As temperature decreases, so \ntoo does the rate of diffusion of substrates and metabolites within the intracellular milieu.  \nProliferation in the cold means that more less-efficient mitochondria compensate for this \nlimitation as the mitochondria are closer to the point of ATP demand.  This would be \nparticularly advantageous for the Antarctic L. uva where diffusion of ATP will not only be \nslower, but L. uva also have myocytes 20% greater in diameter and 40-60% greater in \nvolume. \nThis study is the first to find evidence of mitochondrial plasticity in articulate \nbrachiopods, and this is a phylum that has representatives that appear to have existed on Earth \nwith unchanged morphology for over 550 million years, stretching back to the early Cambrian \n(James et al. 1992).  The Brachopoda, Mollusca, Annelida and Vertebrata therefore, have all \nbeen shown to exhibit some degree of mitochondrial plasticity and three of the four phyla \nhave ancestors reaching back to the Cambrian\/Pre-Cambrian.  This obviously has \nevolutionary implications and indicates that mitochondrial flexibility probably has deep \nevolutionary roots, stretching back to the Pre-Cambrian.  Just how the volume density and \ncristae surface density are regulated at a molecular level in response to temperature is still \nlargely unknown.  The recent finding that PGC-1\u03b1 is a master regulator of mitochondrial \nbiogenesis in mammalian and fish muscle (Urschel and O'Brien 2008, Houten and Auwerx \n2004) makes it a prime candidate for examining the effects of temperature on mitochondrial \nproliferation in brachiopods. Irrespective of the regulation mechanisms this study has \ndemonstrated different seasonal and evolutionary mechanisms of compensation of \nmitochondrial function to low temperature in brachiopod adductor muscle. \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThanks to Mike Barker and Paul Meredith, Stephanie Martin and Melody Clark for help \ncollecting brachiopods in New Zealand.
