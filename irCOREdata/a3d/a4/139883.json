TBCs have been continually developed and the subject of\nnumerous research papers since they were first tested on turbine blades 30 years ago [3], although Pratt\nand Whitney were using MgO stabilised zirconia TBCs on burner cans in 1963 [4]. In these early days of\nTBC use they were generally applied to static gas turbine components by plasma spraying and by the\n1980\u2019s 7wt% YSZ emerged as the industry standard ceramic top coat for TBC systems [4]. In the late\n1980\u2019s electron beam physical vapour deposition techniques were being used to deposit the top coat onto\nrotating blades. This deposition method resulted in a columnar microstructure which imparted a high\ndegree of strain tolerance making them ideal for applications involving frequent thermal cycles [4,5].\nDuring the early years of TBC use in gas turbine engines oxidation of the bond coat was typically\naccepted as the primary cause of failure, and has thus been extensively researched, specifically issues\nassociated with thermal cycling of the TBC [6-9]. Erosion of TBCs while acknowledged as a problem\n[10,11] has until recently been considered a secondary problem, however with the use of EB PVD TBCs\non turbine blades erosion has become more of an issue and has received more attention with numerous\npapers covering the topic of TBC erosion. Early work concentrated on the effect of variables like\nvelocity, impact angle and erodent properties [12-15], while more recent work has examined erosion\nmechanisms [16-18] and the effects of aging and dopent additions [19].\n2However, as the ceramic top coat and the processing have developed the temperatures at which TBCs\nhave operated has increased significantly resulting in oxidation issues with the bond coat and more\nrecently, with the surface of the TBC reaching temperatures greater than 1240\u00b0C, CMAS attack. CMAS,\nor calcium magnesium alumina silicates, is a low melting point flux which can form deposits on the\nsurface of the TBC. When the surface temperature is greater than 1240\u00b0C, the CMAS melting\ntemperature [20] CMAS will infiltrate the TBC resulting in extensive degradation of the columnar\nmicrostructure and \u2018locking\u2019 the tops of the columns together on cooling resulting in a loss of strain\ntolerance.\nThe schematic in Figure 1 illustrates the various degradation mechanisms that can occur to thermal\nbarrier coatings during service in gas turbine engines. During laboratory testing most of these issues are\ninvestigated independently, whereas in reality a number of these mechanisms are normally occurring\nsimultaneously. This paper briefly discusses the various degradation mechanisms before examining the\ninteractions between some of the mechanisms specifically CMAS attack and erosion (i.e. erosion-\ncorrosion).\n2 Erosion Mechanisms\nThe erosion mechanisms of EB PVD TBCs have been discussed in numerous papers [16-18] the last few\nyears and have been broadly divided into three different mechanisms relating to both the damage\nmorphology and degree of damage caused to the coatings. Briefly, these consist of:\n\uf0b7 Erosion - the gradual chipping away of the coating with damage confined to the top 30\u00b5m of the\ncoating. This mechanism operates during impact by small particles travelling at high velocities\nand cracks are initiated in individual columns. A number of neighbouring columns need to be\ncracked before material is lost from the coating, cracks do not propagate across columns.\n\uf0b7 Compaction Damage \u2013 the densification of the top of the coating without either cracking or gross\ndeformation of the coating. This is an intermediate transition mechanism between erosion and\nFOD.\n\uf0b7 Foreign Object Damage - the gross deformation of the coating, often through to the bond coat,\nwith associated regions of densification, cracking and kink bands, Type I FOD. Under FOD\nconditions the contact area is significantly larger than the average column diameter and occurs\nover a significant number of columns. Under high temperature conditions it is possible for the EB\nPVD columns to deform plastically in the form of \u2018S\u2019 bends without the associated cracking and\nkink band formation, Type II FOD, as a means of adsorbing the impact energy.\nThese different erosion mechanisms, illustrated in Figure 2, can also be described in terms of the ratio\nbetween the contact diameter of the impacting particle and the column diameter. This is a similar\nprinciple to the measured decrease in TBC hardness with increasing load [21], which relates to the number\nof columns with which the indenter interacts as illustrated in Figure 3. This effect is due to the fact that at\nlow loads the indenter is interacting with only one column and hence is measuring the hardness of a single\ncolumn, however as the load increases the number of columns with which the indenter interacts increases\nresulting in greater system compliance and hence a lower measured hardness. As the load in increased the\npoint is reached where the system compliance is no longer increasing and the hardness of the coating is\nbeing measured.\nIt was this observation that initially led to the concept of the D\/d ratio, where D is the contact footprint\ndiameter and d is the column diameter. This dimensionless ratio takes into account a number of otherwise\ndifficult to resolve variables, including coating and particle mechanical properties, particle size and\nparticle velocity. The graph in Figure 4 shows that the D\/d ratio allows one to clearly determine the\ndamage mechanism that is operating under particle impact conditions. Further work needs to be\nconducted to couple the D\/d ratio with the strain rate in order to generate a new type of erosion map. As\n3can be seen from the graph in Figure 4 a D\/d ratio of less than 2 indicates an erosion mechanism, while a\nratio of 2-12 indicates a compaction mechanism and greater than 12 a foreign object damage mechanism.\nFor the measured results so far it appears as though this ratio is independent of temperature.\nRecently Steenbakker et al [22] identified a new erosion mechanism while examining the effects of\ngadolinia additions on the erosion of EB PVD TBCs, where, due to the effect of the extremely narrow\ncolumns, 3-5\u00b5m diameter, the coating behaved more as a continuum than as a discreet columns. As can\nbe seen in Figure 5a lateral cracks appear to propagate across the column boundaries without any\ndifficulty. However, under the high temperature (825\u00b0C) test conditions the erosion mechanism changed\nto a FOD mechanism, as illustrated in Figure 5b, with the associated cracking and kink bands. This\nchange in mechanism was partly attributed to the increase in velocity of the 825\u00b0C tests over the room\ntemperature tests and the associated increase in contact area, further illustrating the effect of the D\/d ratio\non the erosion of EB PVD TBCs.\nThe dimensionless ratio D\/d has a number of advantages in determining the erosion regime for EB PVD\nTBCs and if coupled with strain rates during impact could be used to generate useful erosion maps. The\ncolumn diameter of EB PVD TBCs is fairly standard for a given deposition process and can also be easily\nmeasured. While the contact footprint diameter includes a large number of important variables into one\nparameter, these variables include particle velocity, density size and mechanical properties as well as the\nmechanical properties of the EB PVD TBC. Although more difficult to measure than the column\ndiameter, the contact footprint diameter can be calculated to a first approximation using Hertzian contact\nprinciples [16].\n3 Corrosion (CMAS Attack)\nUntil recently the maximum surface temperatures of TBCs during peak operation conditions was lower\nthan 1240\u00b0C and hence attack of the TBC by molten CMAS (calcium-magnesium-alumina-silicates) was\nnot an issue. However, as the drive to more efficient engines continues and the reliability and\nperformance of EB PVD TBCs improves, TBC surface temperatures of 1240\u00b0C and greater can occur\nduring normal operating conditions. This is the temperature at which CMAS melts and, as it has excellent\nwetting properties, it can easily penetrate into the structure of the TBC. Since the TBC is in a thermal\ngradient the depth of penetration of the CMAS is limited to the point at which the TBC temperature is\nequal to the melting temperature of the CMAS. The SEM micrograph in Figure 6 shows how CMAS\nattack causes degradation of the TBC columnar microstructure.\nCMAS attack not only degrades the columnar microstructure but also the crystal structure and resulted in\na transformation from the metastable tetragonal phase (t\u2019) to monoclinic (m) after only 24hrs at 1500\u00b0C as\nillustrated by the Raman spectra in Figure 7 an effect that has been noted by other researchers in the\nliterature [23]. However, this chemical attack is not the only problem associated with CMAS damage of\nEB PVD TBCs, delamination of the regions infiltrated by the CMAS via a cold shock mechanism can\ncause significant and rapid loss of the TBC [20]. Upon cooling of the TBC to below 1240\u00b0C the CMAS\nwill solidify and \u2018lock\u2019 the infiltrated columns together thus affecting the strain tolerance of the TBC.\nDuring shut down of the engine with its associated rapid cooling of the TBC high stresses will develop in\nthe surface region which can initiate cracking parallel to the surface of the TBC. Future engine cycles will\nresult in the spallation of the TBC exposing \u2018fresh\u2019 TBC to CMAS attack. This mechanism can result in\nthe rapid loss of the TBC in regions subjected to CMAS attack. Furthermore, depending on the degree of\npenetration of the CMAS into the coating, the effect of particle impact on rate of material loss can vary\nsignificantly as discussed in the following section under erosion corrosion.\n44 Erosion Corrosion\nOne of the fundamental points about the erosion of EB PVD TBCs is that cracks, initiated by particle\nimpact in the erosion regime, do not propagate across the column boundaries, which accounts for their\nrelatively low erosion rate. However, under erosion conditions, once the column has cracked material is\nthen relatively easily removed from the surface once a number of its nearest neighbours have also been\ncracked 24. It has been shown [19] that sintering of the columns results in an increase in the erosion rate of\nEB PVD TBCs due to the fact that cracks can propagate into neighboring columns resulting in a greater\nmaterial loss per impact. The graph in Figure 8 shows that even though the sample that suffered from\nCMAS degradation was aged for 24hrs at 1500\u00b0C its erosion rate was marginally lower than that of the\nstandard TBC, while other samples aged for 24hrs at 1500\u00b0C in the absence of CMAS showed a\nsignificant increase in erosion rate due to sintering effects.\nIn the same way that metals show various different responses to particle impact under erosion corrosion\nconditions, which is dependent on both the thickness of the oxide relative to the depth of damage caused\nby the impact, resulting in different erosion-corrosion or erosion oxidation regimes [25-28], the response\nof TBCs to impact will depend on the depth of CMAS penetration relative to the depth of damage caused\nby an impacting particle. When the CMAS has penetrated into the whole coating as shown in Figure 6 a\n\u2018corrosion dominated\u2019 erosion regime will prevail. In this case the erosion properties of the CMAS\ninfiltrated TBC will determine the rate of material removal, which under room temperature erosion\nconditions is slightly lower than a standard EB PVD TBC, as illustrated in Figure 8. This is attributed to\nthe fact that the infiltrated CMAS has solidified and that the system is now behaving as a continuum and\ncracks initiated in the surface propagate as in a solid and since there are no free edges material is only lost\nwhen these cracks intersect with the surface. This is illustrated in Figure 9 where a high degree of\ncracking can be seen in the near surface region and the associated formation of long lateral cracks.\nOn the other hand if instead of infiltrating the whole coating the CMAS only penetrates a small degree\ninto the coating (in the region of 30\u00b5m), as would be expected in an operational environment due to the\nthermal gradient, it is likely that a \u2018corrosion modified\u2019 regime will operate. This is when the impact\ndepth is of a similar size to the depth of CMAS penetration (oxide thickness in metals). Such studies have\nyet to be performed, however, it is expected that in such a situation the impacting particles would initiate\ncracks in the TBC parallel to the surface thus facilitating the cold shock mechanism and accelerating the\nrate of TBC degradation. If however the CMAS penetration was only a few microns into the surface of\nthe TBC it is likely that a different mechanism will operate, \u2018corrosion enhanced\u2019 erosion, which would\naccelerate the rate of material loss.\nSince, under normal operating conditions, particle flux in an engine is low, the erosion rate is also low.\nThus even on a long flight erosion-corrosion rates will not be high and it is thus the frequency of engine\ncycling which becomes important making the cold shock mechanism described in section 3 the dominant\ndegradation mechanism. For CMAS erosion the D\/d ratio could still be an effective means of determining\nthe erosion regime except that d would have to equate to the depth of CMAS penetration. These\nmechanisms will be highly dependent on the surface temperature of the TBC, however since CMAS\ninfiltration is only likely to occur during peak operation of the engine, i.e. take off, it is reasonable to\nassume that under \u2018normal\u2019 cruising conditions the CMAS solidifies.\n5. Conclusions\nIt has been shown that the D\/d ratio can be used to determine the erosion regime for EB PVD TBCs:\n\uf0b7 A ratio less than 2 indicates an erosion mechanism with near surface cracking.\n5\uf0b7 A ratio of between 2 and 12 indicates a compaction damage mechanism.\n\uf0b7 A ratio of greater than 12 indicates a FOD damage mechanism with the associated regions of\ncompaction damage near the surface and kink bands that can propagate to the interface.\nCMAS attack has been shown to degrade EB PVD TBC via a number of different mechanisms:\n\uf0b7 Degrades the columnar microstructure.\n\uf0b7 Facilitates the t\u2019 to monoclinic phase transformation.\n\uf0b7 On cooling the system to below the CMAS melting point the TBC loses its strain tolerance and\nbecomes susceptible to a cold shock delamination degradation mechanism.\nHowever, the current study has also shown that under conditions of total CMAS penetration into the\ncoating the erosion rate is slightly lower than that for as received EB PVD TBCs due to the fact that the\nsystem behaves more like a continuum than discreet columns. In order to fully understand the effects of\nCMAS on the erosion resistance of EB PVD TBCs it will be necessary to examine the effects of the depth\nof penetration and temperature on the erosion resistance, a program of work is currently being developed\nto assess these issues.\n6.
