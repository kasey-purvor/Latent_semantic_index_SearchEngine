INTRODUCTION \nIt is hard to overstate the explosive growth in popularity that \nOnline Social Networks (OSNs) have experienced in the last few \nyears. In the UK, connections to OSNs account for nearly 10% of \nall web requests and in both the UK and the USA, social \nnetworking sites are the most popular class of website except for \nsearch [4].The two most popular OSNs, MySpace and Facebook \n[4], both reach out to 3rd party developers by exposing interfaces \n(via OpenSocial [7] and the Facebook API [3]) that can be used to \ndevelop applications that integrate with the social graph \nmaintained by each service. This has allowed thousands of \ndevelopers to create applications that take advantage of a \u201cready-\nmade\" community. The platforms handle necessary services such \nas user management and verification, and in return the developers \ncan provide highly integrated and socially useful applications that \nseamlessly integrate with the user experience on the site. \nFor Facebook, games are the most popular class of application \nthat is available on the platform. The top games include \napplications such as \u201cPet Society\u201d, \u201cTexas HoldEM Poker\u201d and \n\u201cMafia Wars\u201d, where each attracts over 1.6M daily active users \n[1]. The massive success of these games is arguably due to them \ntaking full advantage of the social nature of the platform \u2013 playing \nwith friends rather than strangers adds a compelling social \ndimension to what are otherwise fairly pedestrian games. \n1.1 Application Classification \nSharabi [9] proposes that applications built on social network \nplatforms such as Facebook can be classified based on their social \npurpose. \nPhatic Communication Tools are about maintaining social \ncontact through small one-way interactions, such as sending gifts, \nhugs and pokes. This is a form of social touch that reinforces the \nimportance of a relationship in a small but meaningful way. It \nisn\u2019t a grand intervention like a phone call, but rather a small \nreminder that the relationship has value. \nSelf Presentation Tools allow people to define their identities \nfrom their perspective. This includes applications that allow \npeople to post their current mood, and also applications such as \niLike that allow users to post lists of movies or bands that they \nlike. The act of choosing these artefacts and displaying them \npublicly on their profile is used as a way to present aspects of \ntheir personality to friends. \nCollective Identity Formation applications are those that ask \nother people to define a person's identity \u2013 For example, ``Hot or \nNot\" style games or applications that ask users to pick adjectives \n \n. \n \nto describe their friends. These are used to find out what other \npeople think about them as a person in a playful way. \nIn this paper we explore applications used for identity \npresentation, but autonomously based on behaviour in addition to \npeer-review. \n1.2 Identity Presentation Games \nThe Facebook API exposes a wealth of social information about \napplication users that can be used to create powerful social tools. \nThe main issue is with presentation \u2013 there is so much interesting \ndata on the social behaviour of the user, but how can we present \nthis complex data in an intuitive and meaningful way? \nSo far, there have been very few automated presentation tools, \nincluding the \u201cFriend Wheel\u201d application1, which shows the \nconnections between your friends and the mutual acquaintances \nwithin a person\u2019s immediate social network. There have also been \nmany simple quiz applications of the sort \u201cWhat kind of X are \nyou\u201d, where players fill out short questionnaires which are used in \nsimple calculations to work out which character from the cartoon \nHe-Man or the TV series The Wire your answers most closely \nmatch.  \n By developing \nFamiliars the intention \nwas to create an identity \npresentation tool that \nreflects the real social \nactivity of the players on \nFacebook in a simple and \nmeaningful way. \nFamiliars takes great \nadvantage of the \ncapabilities of the \nFacebook Developers \nAPI and uses analysis \ntechniques from many \nfields, including facial \nexpression recognition \nand social network \nanalysis, to build a \ncomplex multi-faceted picture of the status of the player. This is \nthen distilled and represented to the user as a holistic reflection of \ntheir current socio-emotional state. \n2. FAMILIARS \nFamiliars is based around the concept of each player owning a \ncompanion animal \u2013a virtual sprite or creature similar in concept \nto Pullman\u2019s d\u00e6mons [8] \u2013 which take an animal form that \nrepresents the personality of the owner. The pattern of a players \ninteractions and behaviour in the social network of the game and \nFacebook itself is used to directly decide what animal form a \nplayer\u2019s familiar should take. For example, a player who has \nmany friends and is very active in the social environment of \nFacebook, the familiar may choose to take the form of a highly \nsocial animal (e.g. a Rabbit) to reflect this aspect of their \npersonality. Similarly a relatively less socially active player\u2019s \nfamiliar may choose to be a solitary creature such as a Bear. \n                                                                  \n1 http:\/\/apps.facebook.com\/friendwheel \nIn terms of Sharabi\u2019s classifications [9], Familiars can be \nconsidered a self-presentation tool. The key difference is that the \nplayer has very little direct impact on the form the familiar will \nchoose, since analysing the actual behaviour of the owner makes \nthis decision. For example, allowed to define their own identity, \nplayers may choose to represent themselves as highly social. \nHowever, in Familiars, by analysing the observed social activity \nof the player, this may not prove to be an accurate representation. \nThe Familiars application was developed on the Facebook \nDeveloper\u2019s Platform [3] and made available to all Facebook \nusers to install on their \u201cprofile\u201d2. By agreeing to install the \napplication, a small box would appear on their profile page \nshowing the current animal form of the familiar and a link to show \nmore details. \nWithin the application itself, users can see the current familiar \n(and the reasons why it has chosen this form), the social status of \nany groups the player is a part of, and may also suggest the \nfamiliar runs facial expression recognition on specific \nphotographs in order to learn more about their owner. \n2.1 Autonomous Behaviour Analysis \nThe primary method a familiar uses to determine an appropriate \nform to take is through a process of automated behaviour analysis \nbased on data provided by the Facebook Developer\u2019s API. \nWhen a Facebook user installs an application, they must accept an \nagreement that permits Facebook to pass on details about personal \nbehaviour and status to the application. It is through this process \nthat Familiars collects behaviour data for analysis.  \n \nFigure 2 - Using Photographs, Social Network Analysis and \nActivity to determine form \n \n                                                                  \n2 Available at http:\/\/apps.facebook.com\/familiar \n \nFigure 1 - \"Friend Wheel\" \nVisualisation \n \nFrom the data provided by Facebook, we classify behaviour based \non three dimensions: Sociability, Attitude and Activity.The data \nis collected from all these sources and combined in order to \ndetermine the type of animal the familiar should be.  \n2.1.1 PASION Augmentation Services \nFamiliars is a part of the EU PASION project (Psychologically \nAugmented Social Interaction Over Networks), and uses several \nPASION technologies [2] in order to facilitate the analysis of \nsocial and emotional data. \nThe main technology used is in the analysis of social behaviour \nusing Social Network Analysis (SNA). PASION offers a remote \nsoftware component that is able to calculate social indices for both \nindividuals (Degree Centrality, In and Out-degree Centrality, \nReciprocity) and groups (Centralization, Group Reciprocity, \nDensity) based on interaction data provided by an application \nsuch as Familiars [6] [11]. \nSecondly, Familiars uses a Facial Expression Recognition service \n(FER) to distil emotion from the input of static images [10]. These \nare harvested from Facebook by the game and passed on to the \nremote FER service for analysis. \n2.1.2 Sociability \nThe sociability measure is based on the social activity of the \nplayer within their peer group and the application itself.  \nFacebook provides powerful tools for analyzing the \u201csocial graph\u201d \nthat is built around the activity of the user. Familiars accesses \ndata on the number of friends a player has, and whether they \nthemselves are Familiars players. The group membership data is \nanalysed in terms of the number of groups a player is a member \nof, the shared group membership with friends and the changes in \nthis data over time. The value for sociability is normalised across \nthe player community in order to provide a wider range of values \nfor sociability. \nFamiliars uses PASION Social Network Analysis (SNA) tools to \nanalyse the relationships between players in Facebook groups. \nThe two main calculations are for player Centrality (how central \nthey are in the community) and Reciprocity (how likely a player is \nto reciprocate any social interaction). The combined factors \nprovided by the SNA calculations and the normalised social \nactivity of the player within Facebook provide a rich set of inputs \nthat are used to calculate the dimension for sociability. \n2.1.3 Attitude \nThe attitude measure is a vale that represents the current \ntemperament of the owner.  The main method that attitude is \ncalculated is through analysis of the facial expressions of the \nphotographs of the player. \nFacebook gives application developers access to image data for \nevery photograph that has been tagged with an application user. \nThis provides a powerful capability so that any photograph \ncontaining that person can be accessed by the system so long as \nthey have been tagged as appearing in the photograph using the \nnormal Facebook photograph tagging mechanism. For example, a \nphoto containing person X could have been uploaded by person \nY, and tagged by person Z, and the application could have access \nto this photo regardless of whether persons Y or Z are application \nusers or not. \nThe photograph data is analysed using a remote Facial Expression \nRecognition (FER) engine (provided by PASION) that is able to \nextract the facial features found in the picture. Based on the \nmeasurements between the various facial features, the engine is \ncapable of associating an expression and a value for confidence. \nThis in turn is distilled into a positive or negative value for \n\u201cvalence\u201d or temperament, which is used to adjust the value for \nattitude for the Familiar.  \n \nFigure 3 - Analysing Facial Expressions on Facebook \nPhotographs \n2.1.4 Activity \nThe activity measure is calculated based on the recent activity of a \nplayer within the application and to an extent within Facebook \nitself. Any page view within the Familiars application and each \naction taken within the game is recorded as part of the player \nactivity.  Also, activity with Facebook such as numbers of wall \nposts, and group membership changes are recorded as activity. \nThe activity dimension is time-based so only activity that \noccurred within the past 7 days is considered.  \n2.2 Voting \nThe Familiars application is capable of analysing personality in a \ncompletely autonomous manner. However, a facility for voting is \nprovided so that players are able to adjust the form an animal \ntakes manually if they don\u2019t feel it is appropriate. \nAn owner of a familiar, or a friend of an owner, may suggest that \na familiar changes form to a different animal. This suggestion is \ngiven by simply clicking the animal form they think it should \ntake.  At the point of voting, a player is able to see the various \nattributes for Sociability, Attitude and Activity in order to make \nan informed choice about the most suitable animal that should be \npicked. \nWhen a vote is received by the game, the appropriate adjustment \nis calculated based on the current profile of the owner, the \nsuggested form and the number of suggestions a player has made. \nA vector is calculated between the current emotional profile of the \nplayer as understood by the game and the suggested form. The \ncurrent emotional profile is adjusted based on the angle of this \nvector and weighted by the number of recent interactions. The \nweighting prevents people from \u201cspamming\u201d the system by \nrepeatedly making a suggestion in order to force the familiar to \nchange form. \nPlayers are permitted to suggest their own familiar changes form, \nalthough the weighting for this change is very low to ensure that \ntheir friends always have the biggest input into the type of animal \nthat the familiar chooses. \nVoting as an additional input to the system adds a level of user \npower into the mix \u2013 while the familiar is for the most part \nautonomous, players still have the ability to use the voting system \nto \u201cnudge\u201d the decision in a different direction. This also allows \nfor the familiar to take into account more nebulous feelings from \nfriends that cannot be captured automatically. For instance social \nactivity outside Facebook is invisible to the familiar, so having \nthis data provided in a coarse way by friends through voting helps \nsmooth over this limitation. \nThe voting process also allows players a manual mechanism with \nwhich they can correct perceived errors in the familiar\u2019s analysis. \nFor example, if the Facial Expression Recognition service gives \nan inaccurate response, the error can be corrected by an \nappropriate vote.  \nSuggesting a form for a familiar is also used in the viral spread of \nthe game.  Rather than inviting people to use the application as is \nnormal for Facebook games, players may send an invitation via a \nvote for friends that do not have familiars yet. The recipient \nreceives an invitation message along with text such as \u201cJoe \nBloggs thinks your familiar should be a Wolf!\u201d Should the player \nthen install the application, their new familiar uses this initial vote \nas a baseline for it\u2019s initial calculations.  \n \nFigure 4 - Familiar Voting Interface \n \n2.3 Facebook Group Analysis \nThe Facebook Developers API exposes a wealth of information \nabout the groups of which an application user is a member. These \ndata are used extensively in the calculation of the Sociability \ndimension, but are interesting enough to present to the users in it\u2019s \nown right. \nUsers within Facebook are able to create and join arbitrary groups \nwithin the website. These are usually used for social groups, clubs \nand common interests, but also for fun reasons (e.g. \u201cWhen I was \nyour age, Pluto was a planet\u201d). As such, the group feature is very \nmuch a part of the Facebook user experience. \nBy collecting information about the groups a player is a member \nof, and the group membership of friends, we are able to generate \ninteresting visualisations that expose the social behaviour within \nthe groups in a way that is not available through the normal \nFacebook group interface. \nUsing Social Network Analysis, the PASION services can \ncalculate indices for the groups and members to expose the nature \nof the social interactions that occur within the group.  \nIndices calculated for groups include Centralisation, which shows \nhow tightly knit the members of a group are, Density that shows \nthe volume of intra-group interactions and Group Reciprocity that \nshows how likely group members are to reciprocate social \ninteractions within that group [6][11].  \nIndices calculated for individual members within a group include \npersonal Reciprocity that shows how likely an individual is to \nreciprocate social interactions, and In-degree and Out-degree \nCentrality that shows how important a member is to a group based \non interactions initiated and received.  Figure 5 shows the \ninterface within Familiars that shows connections between users \nwithin a Facebook group. \n \nFigure 5 - Interactions in Facebook Groups \nOf particular interest is the Familiars group connection \nvisualisation, which shows users the group memberships in the \ncontext of their peers \u2013 it is easy to see which of their friends \nbelong to different groups and how the memberships of these \ngroups overlap in the social network. This creates a powerful \ndiscovery and exploration tool for finding new groups a player \nmay wish to join.  \n3. ANIMAL REPRESENTATION \nBetween the autonomous behaviour analysis engine and votes or \nsuggestions gathered from application users and their friends, \nthere is a huge amount of data gathered. The main objective of the \nFamiliars application is to provide a simple, playful experience \nthat reflects the complicated behaviour data in an intuitive way. \nIn the case of Familiars, we chose to use animals as the way to \npresent this information to the users since the concept of animal \npersonalities is simple and easily understood. Recent literature \nsuch as the \u201cDark Materials\u201d trilogy from Philip Pullman [8] rely \nheavily on the idea of animal companions that take different forms \nbased on the personality and emotional state of the owner. \nObviously the choice to use animal representations for the game \nwas only one of many possibilities. It would be trivial to \u201cre-\ntheme\u201d the game with any other presentation layer, for example \n\u201ctypes of car\u201d or even \u201ccharacters from The Simpsons\u201d. \nThe decision of which animals should actually be used in the \napplication was a difficult one and took several brainstorming \nsessions to decide. \nThe three dimensions of sociability, activity and attitude define a \n3D space in which the different types of animal should reside. We \ndecided that there should be a limit of 12 types of animal in order \nto not confuse players with variety, yet provide enough different \ntypes to show clear changes between positions. \nThis enabled us to build a coordinate system with 12 items evenly \nspread around the 3D space, which were filled with animals of an \nappropriate type. \nThe 12 animals we settled on (Wolf, Bear, Fox, Rabbit, Lobster, \nLion, Flamingo, Dolphin, Sea Lion, Lemur, Koala and Owl) were \nchosen based on our own cultural associations and assumptions \nabout the personalities of the creatures.  \n \nFigure 6 - Familiar appearance on Facebook Profile Page \nIt is very important that the animal representations meet the \ncultural values associated with their position within the 3D \npersonality-space we had constructed for familiars. For example, \neven though a Fox may be a highly social creature in reality, the \ncommon conception of the fox is as a solitary scavenger, therefore \nthe personality within the game was recorded as such. After all, \nthe aim of the game is to provide representations of human \npersonalities rather than those of the animals themselves. \nBased on our initial list of animals and personality associations, \nwe conducted a short user study in order to validate our \nassumptions.  \n4. PILOT STUDY \nA short study was conducted ahead of the release of the game to \ninvestigate people\u2019s perception of different species of animals and \nspecifically the 12 animals used in Familiars (bear, wolf, fox, \nrabbit, dolphin, owl, sea lion, lemur, lion, flamingo, koala and \nlobster) with a view to informing the descriptions of Familiars \nand the basis for assigning them to users. \nThe game engine describes each familiar as a point in the 3D \nspace of the game. The 12 animals used in the game were \ninvestigated in order to select those animals for which there is the \ngreatest consensus. The association between the animal and the \npoint in 3-D space was then modified to reflect the opinions of the \nparticipants. \n4.1 Methodology \nA questionnaire was developed in order to understand how people \ndescribe animals in terms of specific characteristics related to the \nPASION augmentation data and the Familiars game.  \nThe questionnaire was composed of five sections, each containing \nboth open\/free response and closed questions. In order to make \nthe study more complete, the investigation involved not just the \n12 animals already used and implemented in Familiars, but also \nanimal species more widely.  \nThe first section of the questionnaire, in fact, elicited free-\nresponses about the animal species most associated with activity, \ncommunication style, positive and negative emotions aroused, and \nsociability. \nThe second section was the most important one as it focused on \nthe 12 animals already used in Familiars, investigating how they \nare seen in terms of activity, attitude and sociability, the three \nmeasures that determine the personality type of each animal. The \nfirst dimension, \u2018Activity\u2019, was investigated using questions \nassessing the level of activity and passivity attributed to various \nanimal species. For \u2018Attitude\u2019, questions were developed in order \nto measure the positive and negative emotions commonly \nassociated with each type of animal. The third dimension, \n\u2018Sociability\u2019, was the most complex to analyze, firstly because the \ntwo SNA indices taken into account (reciprocity and centrality) \nare calculated together in a single algorithm and secondly because \nit would be difficult for people to answer questions about \n\u2018reciprocity\u2019 or \u2018centrality\u2019 in animals. However, because both \nreciprocity and centrality concern the level of involvement that \nthe user has in the game with the other players, and because of the \nplayers\u2019 social aspects taken into account in this measure (number \nof friends, views or suggestions for other friends\u2019 familiars, etc.) \nquestions were asked in order to understand the extend to which \neach animal was described as social or passive.  \nThe third section, aimed to identify people\u2019s preferences among \nthe 12 Familiars. The data collected could complete those coming \nfrom the previous section, giving more information about peoples\u2019 \nwillingness and preferences to be labelled as specific animals. \nThe fourth section looked at which words\/adjectives people use to \ndescribe the 12 animals from Familiars. Findings from this \nsection could be used to inform the description provided in the \ngame given for each type of Familiar, but results will not be \nbroadened in this article. \nThe fifth and final section collected participants\u2019 background \ninformation. \n4.1.1 Participants \nThe questionnaire was distributed to 14 people, 9 females and 5 \nmales with an age between 24 and 44 years old. Participants \nincluded European (English, Scottish, Italian, Spanish, German) \nand African (Nigerian) nationalities. This is significant as \nassociations with different animals are likely to vary from culture \nto culture and Familiars is available on the Web.  \n4.2 Findings \nFor the purposes of clarity, only results coming from the second \nand third section of the questionnaire will be explained, these \nsections being critical for the deciding the assignation of the \nanimals to the 3D space. \n4.2.1 Animal Classification \nThis section investigated attitudes towards the activity level of \neach animal, on a scale from \u2018Very Active\u2019 (5) to \u2018Very Passive\u2019 \n(1). We found that wolves were the animal people described most \nfrequently as very active, followed closely by rabbits, dolphins \nand lions. Lemurs and lobsters obtained a score of just over 3, \nwhile Koalas and owls obtained the lowest score, equal to 2.6, \nwhich places them between \u2018Neither active nor passive\u2019 and \n\u2018Passive\u2019 on the rating scale. \nDolphins were indicated as the happiest animals among the 12 \nlisted, followed by rabbits, both obtaining a score that places them \nbetween \u2018Active\u2019 and \u2018Very active\u2019 on the rating scale. Koalas are \nat the third place followed closely by flamingos. Owls were again \nat the bottom of the list, obtaining the only score lower than 3 \u2013 \nwhich places them between \u2018Neither happy nor unhappy\u2019 and \n\u2018Unhappy\u2019 on the rating scale.  \nDolphins emerged as not only the happiest but also the most \nsocial animal. Together with rabbits, their score places them \nbetween \u2018Social\u2019 and \u2018Very social\u2019 on the rating scale. Flamingo, \nwolf, koala, sea lion, lemur and lion obtained, in order, a score \nthat places them between \u2018Social\u2019 and \u2018Neither social nor \nisolated\u2019. The owl was again at the bottom of the list with a score \nequal to 2.23, the lowest rating for any animal on all the \nquestions.  \n4.2.2 Animal Preference \nThe third section of the questionnaire investigates participants\u2019 \npreference to be labelled as one of the 12 animals, with first, \nsecond and third choice responses (scored as 3, 2 and 1 point \nrespectively). The top-scoring animal was the dolphin, with a \nscore of 17, followed by the lion and the fox, both scoring 12. \nKoalas also obtained a noteworthy score, 9, as did wolves, 7. In \nthe middle of the list were rabbits and sea lions, followed by bears \nand owls.  Very few participants chose flamingos and lemurs as \nthe animal they would like to be labelled as, while no preferences \nfor the lobster were registered.  \nIf you were labelled as an animal, which of the \nfollowing would you like to be?\n0.00\n2.00\n4.00\n6.00\n8.00\n10.00\n12.00\n14.00\n16.00\n18.00\nw\nol\nf\nbe\nar fo\nx\nra\nbb\nit\ndo\nlp\nhi\nn\now\nl\nse\na \nlio\nn\nle\nm\nur\nlio\nn\nfla\nm\nin\ngo\nko\nal\na\nlo\nbs\nte\nr\n \nFigure 7 - Animal Preferences \n4.3 Study Conclusion \nThe results reported above allow us to map the 12 Familiars onto \neach of the 3 dimensions considered in the game. The layout of \nthe 3D space is a 3x2x2 matrix, with Attitude along the axis with \nthree points, while Sociability and Activity have 2 points each. \nThe level of activity, happiness and sociability that the study \nattributed to each animal was here translated to a specific location \nin the 3D space.  In order to follow this structure, 6 animals were \nassigned to the \u2018social\u2019 part of the 3D space and 6 to the \u2018non \nsocial\u2019. Within each of those 6, three animals had to be described \nas \u2018active\u2019, three as \u2018non active\u2019, all distributed along the 3 points \nof the attitude axe. Assigning the animals to a specific cell in the \ntable was mainly based on the results obtained from the second \nsection of the questionnaire. In order to make this selection closer \nto people\u2019s preferences, we also exploited the data collected from \nthe third section of the questionnaire that sampled the animals for \nwhich people prefer to be labelled. \n \nTable 1 - Animal Coordinates \nSOCIAL  \nActivity\\Attitude 0 1 2 \n0 Sea lion Flamingo Koala \n1 Wolf Rabbit Dolphin \nNON SOCIAL  \nActivity\\Attitude 0 1 2 \n0 Owl Bear Lobster \n1 Lion Fox Lemur \nThis study aimed to improve the game by ensuring that active \nplayers are rewarded in the game. Specifically: knowing what \nanimal people prefer to be labelled as allows us to assign these \nanimals (dolphin, fox, koala, etc.) to a social or active position \nwhile taking into consideration how these animals are commonly \nperceived. By doing so, the more actively people play the game, \nthe more likely it will be that the image represented by their \nFamiliar is an animal seen as active and also one that they like \nbeing identified with. \nBased on the personality analysis, a player is assigned a point \nwithin the continuous 3D volume delineated by the extremes of \nthe animal types. The familiar takes the form of the animal whose \ncoordinates are nearest within the space. Thus, while it is possible \nyour familiar takes one form and stays that way (your coordinate \nfirmly close to the coordinate of that type), it is also possible for a \nplayer to be halfway between two animal coordinates and \n \nFigure 8 - Animals in 3D Space \n \ntherefore have a familiar that flips between the two types based on \nsmall changes in behaviour.  \nFigure 8 shows the distribution of the 12 animals in the 3D space \nresulting from our analysis. For the reasons explained above, we \ncan not say this is the only structure possible, but we are confident \nto say that it is the one that can better answer our research \nobjectives.  \n5. SUMMATIVE EVALUATION \nFamiliars was trialled in a two month long study between April \nand June 2009. The game was made open to the public on \nFacebook and added to the Facebook application directory so it \nwould appear as any other Facebook application does within the \nsite. Invitations were sent out to acquaintances and colleagues \nboth in the UK and in Italy, with the expectation that there would \nbe some natural viral growth through Facebook itself.  \nFigure 10 shows the growth of the player-base (n=268) over the \nsummative evaluation in comparison with the players removing \nthe application. The growth of the game community is \ncharacterised by the \u201cstepped\u201d appearance of sharp increases in \nregistrations followed by periods of slower spread. This is perhaps \na result of the underlying nature of the social graph upon which \nthe game is built. Periods of rapid growth indicate the spread into \nnew groups of friends via mutual acquaintances. Due to the data \nprotection policy of Facebook, it is not possible to gather detailed \ninformation on the relationships between players so it is not \npossible to confirm this observation. \nFigure 9 shows how the voting system was used by players to \nsuggest forms for each others\u2019 familiars. The interactions are split \nby degrees, which is the number of distinct players a vote was \nmade for, or received by, against the frequency of that number \namongst the whole player base. As can be seen, a small minority \nof players interacted with a large number of different players and \nwere responsible for most voting interactions within the game, \nwhich follows with previous work that suggests that social games \nare held together by this minority of highly active \u201chardcore\u201d \nplayers [5]. \n5.1 Player Feedback \nAs part of the summative evaluation, an online questionnaire has \nbeen developed and launched during the last week of the trial in \norder to collect peoples\u2019 opinion about the game. \nAs part of a larger questionnaire,, including questions that give a \ngeneral overview of the population, the questions investigate: ease \nof play, \u201cenjoyability\u201d and privacy issues of Familiars. \n5.1.1 Methodology and participants \nAll those that took part in the trial were invited to fill in the \nquestionnaire. A notification message was sent them through \nFacebook, with the direct link to the questionnaire. \n16 people took part in it, 7 males and 9 females. The majority of \nthe participants (14) were equally distributed between 18 and 35 \nyears old, while only 2 were between 36 and 60: a sample that \nseems representative of the Facebook population. \nThe educational background was also quite differentiated, \nincluding participants representing all levels of education, from \nsecondary school to doctorate degree. \nAs regards the Nationality, the majority of the sample (9) resulted \nto be English, while 2 of them were Irish. \n5.1.2 Results \nA 1-5 Likert scale from \u2018Disagree\u2019 to \u2018Agree\u2019 was used to collect \nthe data for the first 2 questions, while the third provided a \nyes\/no\/don\u2019t know answer modality.  Data from an open question \non how to better protect the privacy of the users were also \ncollected. \nThe first research question that we investigated regards the ease \nof play of Familiars. Results show how the 37% of the subjects \nagreed that Familiars was easy to play, 44% of them somewhat \nagreed, while the remaining 19% chose the middle option \n \nFigure 10 - Growth of Player-base \n \n \n \n \nFigure 9 - Distribution of Interactions (log-log) \n \n\u2018Neither agree nor disagree\u2019, showing a rather shared opinion \nabout the simplicity of the game. \nThe second question investigated the \u201cenjoyability\u201d of the game. \nWhen asked to indicate their level of agreement with the \nstatement \u2018I enjoyed playing Familiars\u2019, the majority of the \nsubjects agreed or somewhat agreed with it, the 19% disagreed or \nsomewhat disagreed, while the remaining 12,5% chose the middle \noption. Despite being less positive that the previous question, with \nalmost a fifth of the subjects giving a negative opinion, the results \nshow again a general appreciation of the game, with almost the \n70% that claimed to enjoy playing Familiars. \nThe important last question concerned the level of privacy \nprotection that players perceived felt was given them by the game. \nThe 69% of participants answered positively, 12% felt a lack of \nprivacy protection, while the remaining 19% wasn\u2019t sure. When \nasked which changes participants would suggest to better protect \nthe privacy of users, the use of a username rather than the actual \nname of the player was mentioned. Another participant recognised \nthat the insecurity was due to lack of privacy protection in \nFacebook platform rather than in the game. \n6. DISCUSSION \nIn this paper we have presented the social game Familiars, which \nwe have developed to explore the opportunities and limits of \ndeveloping social games on top of a social platform such as \nFacebook. Traditionally, social games have been self-standing \nsocial experiences between strangers, but OSNs such as Facebook \nallow developers to take advantage of the real social links \nbetween people to enhance their games. \nSpecifically, Familiars is an example of an identity presentation \ntool \u2013 rather than being a self-contained experience, it is directly \nlinked to the identity of the player and how they present \nthemselves to their friends within the social network. \nFamiliars uses the capabilities of the Facebook platform to a great \nextent, and gathers a wide range of information about the social \nbehaviour, activity and attitude of the user within their normal \nusage of the site. This information is distilled and presented to the \nuser in the form of an animal companion, whose animal form is \nbased directly on their personal behaviour. \nPresenting the rich social and behavioural information about the \nplayer in the form of an animal companion is intended to create a \nplayful interface to the complex underlying data.  The types of \nfamiliars available within the game were carefully studied to \nmake sure the cultural associations fit with the personalities each \ntype represented, even across different cultures. \nWhile each individual player may not agree with the distinctions \nbetween the different animal types available in the application and \ntheir relation to the players, it does provide a contained and \nconsistent \u201cgame world\u201d that invites players to see how changing \ntheir real behaviour within Facebook as a whole can be reflected \nin a playful way through the form of their familiar. \nOne of the strengths of the application is the ease with which it \ncan be repurposed for other player-types who may not be \ncomfortable or interested in the animal theme of the game. For \nexample it would be easy to replace animals with types of cars or \ncharacters from films or television. \n6.1 Limitations of Social Network Platform \nDespite the power available to developers using an OSN as a \nplatform for an application, it must be noted that by choosing to \nrely on a third party so heavily has its issues. \nMainly there is the issue of lack of control \u2013 for most applications, \nall game interface elements need to be presented within the \ninterface of the OSN itself \u2013 this is handled transparently but the \ndeveloper doesn\u2019t have control over what advertisements, etc. are \nshown and your design must carefully match that of the OSN \nitself. \nAccess to data is also highly restricted for good reason, for \nexample spam is prevented by disallowing access to users\u2019 email \naddresses. Even where data access is granted it is with limitations \n\u2013 Facebook allows you to access a user\u2019s real name, but it is \nforbidden to store this on your server.  There are many such \npitfalls and conditions that developers must be aware of. \n7.
