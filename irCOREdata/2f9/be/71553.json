We investigate classical and semiclassical aspects of codimension-two bifurcations\nof periodic orbits in Hamiltonian systems. A classification of these bifurcations in autonomous\nsystems with two degrees of freedom or time-periodic systems with one degree of freedom is\npresented. We derive uniform approximations to be used in semiclassical trace formulae and\ndetermine also certain global bifurcations in conjunction with Stokes transitions that become\nimportant in the ensuing diffraction catastrophe integrals.\n1. Introduction\nPeriodic-orbit theory aims at the semiclassical evaluation of energy levels of quantum\nsystems and relates their spectral properties to periodic orbits of the corresponding classical\nsystem. For autonomous systems one considers the trace of the Green function G.E\/ which\ndetermines also the density of states d.E\/. For periodically driven systems the objects of\ninterest are the traces trFn of the stroboscopic time-evolution operator over n periods;\nthey encode the so-called quasienergies of states that are stationary in the stroboscopic\ndescription. Both types of traces can be written as a sum of individual contributions\nof periodic orbits for chaotic (hyperbolic) systems [1\u20134] or a sum over rational tori for\nintegrable motion [5, 6].\nRecent semiclassical studies [7\u201312] based on periodic-orbit theory were devoted to the\nneighbourhood, in the space of control parameters, of classical bifurcations. These are\ninstances in which periodic orbits coalesce and are the mechanism how orbits are born or\ndisappear, or change their configuration when the energy or an external parameter is varied.\nBifurcations are ubiquitous in systems with a mixed phase space and pave the path from\nintegrable to chaotic motion.\nA collective treatment of the bifurcating orbits was found necessary, and even more the\ninclusion of predecessors of such orbits which live in complexified phase space and were\ncalled ghosts. A collective contribution comes from an orbit cluster; only when far away\nfrom the bifurcation can it be written as a sum of individual contributions. Both types of\ncontributions are an additive term in the periodic-orbit expansion of the trace in question.\nThe existing semiclassical (and most of the classical) studies focus on the generic\nbifurcations in the classification of Meyer and Bruno [13\u201315] (see also [8]). These are the\nbifurcations that are typically encountered when one has only a single parameter at hand\nto steer the system through parameter space, or, equivalently, when one investigates the\nperiodic-orbit families in a given autonomous system as a function of energy. In general\none assigns a codimension to each type of bifurcation by counting the number of parameters\n0305-4470\/98\/184167+30$19.50 c\u00a9 1998 IOP Publishing Ltd 4167\n4168 H Schomerus\nto be controlled in order to encounter it in a general setting. (The class of bifurcations of a\ngiven codimension is enlarged when symmetries are imposed on the system [16\u201320].) The\ngeneric bifurcations are accordingly the bifurcations of codimension one. In each of these\nbifurcations there is a central orbit of period n, surrounded by one or two satellite orbits of\nperiod nm. The cases m D 1; 2; 3; 4 are the tangent, period-doubling, period-tripling, and\nperiod-quadrupling bifurcations, respectively. There are two types of period-quadrupling\nbifurcations (island chain and touch-and-go), but only one for all other m. All period-m\nbifurcations with m > 5 follow the island chain pattern.\nIn [7\u20139] transitional approximations for the collective contributions were derived that\nare only valid close to the (generic) bifurcation; far away from the bifurcation they give\nrise to individual contributions with the wrong amplitudes. See [10\u201312] for uniform\napproximations that are valid even far away from the bifurcation, where they asymptotically\nsplit into individual contributions with the correct amplitudes. Both types of approximations\ninvolve integrals with a phase function 8 and an amplitude function 9.\nIt was demonstrated in [21] that bifurcations of codimension two are frequently felt\nsemiclassically and necessitate a collective treatment even when one steers the system\nthrough control space with less than two parameters. This implies that collective\ncontributions of this kind will constitute a basic element in a semiclassical trace formula for\nsystems with a mixed phase space. They indeed played an essential role in the semiclassical\ndetermination of the quasienergies of the kicked top [22].\nThis work is devoted to these bifurcations of codimension two in autonomous\nHamiltonian systems with two degrees of freedom or time-periodic Hamiltonian systems\nwith one degree of freedom. The bifurcations are classified and their impact on semiclassical\nperiodic-orbit theory is studied in detail. We derive uniform approximations of collective\ncontributions to the semiclassical traces and discuss certain global bifurcations in conjunction\nwith so-called Stokes transition.\nBifurcations of codimension two manifest themselves in one-parameter studies in\ncertain sequences of generic bifurcations. Sadovski\u0131\u00b4 and coworkers [23, 24] found that\nsuch sequences can be explained by normal-form theory [25\u201328], but did not attempt a\nclassification with respect to the codimension. The classical part of the present study is\nvery much inspired by these works. (Bibliographic notes on multiparametric bifurcations\ncan be found in [29].) The derivation of uniform approximations follows the ideas of\n[10\u201312].\nThis paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we present normal forms for\nthe Hamiltonian that describe the bifurcations of codimension two, they are derived in\nappendix A. The classification is a straightforward extension of the results for codimension\none and is simply achieved by including higher-order terms in an expansion in the canonical\nvariables around the bifurcating orbits. We find that they are again organized by the\nmultiplicity m in analogy to the situation for codimension one. The case m D 3 is an\nexception, since no bifurcation of codimension two exists. The codimension-three case,\nalready studied in [21], bears the qualitative features of the other scenarios and is discussed\ninstead.\nThe corresponding sequences of codimension-one bifurcations involve a tangent\nbifurcation of period nm, followed by a period-m bifurcation that involves another orbit of\nperiod n.\nThe normal forms and the sequences of codimension-one bifurcations in the\nneighbourhood of the codimension-two point in control space (technically speaking, the\nunfolding of the normal forms) are discussed and illustrated in section 3.\nWith section 4 we turn to aspects within semiclassical periodic-orbit theory and\nPeriodic orbits near bifurcations of codimension two 4169\npresent the starting point for the derivation of collective contributions of bifurcating orbits,\nconsisting of a two-dimensional integral over phase space or a Poincare\u00b4 surface of section\nthat involves the generating function OS of the classical stroboscopic map.\nThe derivation of transitional expressions is a simple task in view of the works of Ozorio\nde Almeida and Hannay [7, 8]. The uniform expressions, however, require more effort. We\npresent normal forms of the phase function 8 and the amplitude function 9.\nThe details of the derivation are given in appendix B. Specifically, investigating the\ninfluence from higher-order terms in the phase function 8 equips us with a sufficient number\nof coefficients to guarantee the right stationary-phase limit of the expressions, which are\ntherefore truly uniform. This technique was developed for codimension one by Sieber [10]\nand subsequently used by Sieber and the present author in [11, 12]. While the transitional\nand the uniform expressions only differ in the amplitude function for codimension one,\nit turns out that the phase function is also sometimes modified in the present situation.\n(The cases m D 1; 2 lead to standard diffraction integrals connected to the cusp and\nbutterfly catastrophes, respectively. Among the large number of applications, the transitional\napproximations have been investigated in connection to bifurcations of closed orbits in [30].\nUniform approximations have not been derived there, however, and the canonically invariant\ndetermination of coefficients as well as Stokes transitions are also not discussed.)\nIn section 5 we discuss certain global bifurcations that become important in the\nensuing diffraction catastrophe integrals. They give rise to Stokes transitions in which\nthe contribution of a ghost satellite is switched on or off. The ghosts and transitions arise\nwhen the integrals are analysed using the method of steepest descent [31\u201333]. Stokes\ntransitions have been investigated in the context of diffraction integrals and asymptotic\nexpansions before. A uniform approximation for an isolated transition is given in [34]\nand has been applied for perturbed cat maps in [35], which is the only treatment of this\nphenomenon in semiclassics that we know of. The Stokes transitions investigated there,\nhowever, occur far away from any other bifurcation and can be regarded as isolated. A\ntransition requires special treatment when it occurs in the immediate neighbourhood of\na usual \u2018local\u2019 bifurcation, a situation that is often encountered in mixed systems. The\nuniform approximations and normal forms derived here can also be employed to describe\nthe Stokes transition of a period-nm ghost prior to a tangent bifurcation when the so-called\n\u2018dominant\u2019 orbit involved is real and of period n. The complete sequence of local and\nglobal bifurcations that we can handle consists of the period-m bifurcation at the central\norbit and tangent bifurcations of satellites, followed by Stokes transitions in which ghost\nsatellites once more interact with the central orbit.\nWe conclude and point out open questions in section 6.\n2. Normal forms of the Hamiltonian for bifurcations of codimension two\n2.1. Objective\nThe local bifurcations to be discussed are instances in which periodic orbits coalesce as\nparameters are varied. The types of bifurcations generically encountered in a given class of\nsystems depends on the number of parameters varied, and the number of parameters typically\nneeded to be controlled in order to find a particular type is called its codimension. Here\nwe investigate bifurcations of codimension two in the class of periodically time-dependent\nHamiltonian systems with one degree of freedom. In other words, we study families of\nHamiltonians\nH.q; p; tI \"; a\/ (1)\n4170 H Schomerus\nthat depend on the two parameters \" and a and obey H.t\/ D H.t C 1\/, where the period\nis set to unity for convenience. In general these systems have no time-reversal nor any\ngeometric symmetry. The discussion directly carries over to autonomous systems with two\ndegrees of freedom since these can be reduced to one-parameter families of periodic systems\nwith one degree of freedom by a standard procedure described for example in [8].\n2.2. The bifurcation condition\nThe periodic orbits are seen as fixed points in iterations of the so-called stroboscopic map\n.q; p\/ ! .q 0; p0\/ which is induced by the evolution over one period. This map is area\npreserving. Its linearized version\nM D\n0@ @q 0@q\n\f\f\f\np\n@q 0\n@p\n\f\f\f\nq\n@p0\n@q\n\f\f\f\np\n@p0\n@p\n\f\f\f\nq\n1A (2)\n(corresponding to a 2 \u0002 2 matrix) hence obeys detM D 1. Orbits that appear for the first\ntime in the n0th iteration are said to be of primitive period n0. Such an orbit gives rise to\nn0 fixed points in each n-step map with n D rn0, where r is an integer counting repetitions.\nThe eigenvalues \u00151;2 of the linearized n0-step map M.n0\/ are reciprocal to each other. A\nstable orbit has unimodular eigenvalues and hence trM.n0\/ D 2 cos! with the real stability\nangle !. An orbit is instable if the eigenvalues are real. There are two cases depending on\nthe sign of the eigenvalues, trM.n0\/ D \u00062 cosh!0, with the real and by convention positive\ninstability exponent !0.\nIn general, an orbit bifurcates whenever the linearized n-step map M.n\/ (with again\nn D rn0) acts at the locus of the orbit in phase space in at least one direction as the identity\nmap and hence obeys\ntrM.rn0\/ D tr.M.n0\/\/r D 2 (3)\nor, equivalently,\ntrMn0 D 2 cos.2\u0019l=m\/ (4)\nwhere the integers l, m are taken as relatively prime. This bifurcation condition implies\na discrete m-fold rotational symmetry Cm in the flow pattern around the bifurcating orbit.\nFor m > 2 the orbit in question is a \u2018central\u2019 orbit on which \u2018satellite\u2019 orbits of primitive\nperiod n0m contract at the bifurcation. For m D 1 there are two possibilities, the orbit is\neither involved as a satellite in a bifurcation with an orbit of smaller primitive period, or\nit takes part in an isochronous bifurcation with other orbits of same period. Turning these\nobservations around, there is always a central periodic orbit of smallest primitive period n0\namong the bifurcating orbits which coalesces with satellites of period n0m. For that reason\nm is called the multiplicity.\nThe bifurcations of codimension one have been classified by Meyer and Bruno [13\u201315]\n(see section 1). They constitute the building blocks of the scenarios of higher codimension\nand will be illustrated together with those of codimension two in the next section. Recall\nthat for each m there is exactly one type with the exception of m D 4 which allows for two\nvariants.\n2.3. Classification of normal forms\nThe bifurcation condition (4) is reflected by the Hamiltonian flow around the central orbit;\naccordingly, the bifurcations can be investigated by studying the general form of the\nPeriodic orbits near bifurcations of codimension two 4171\nHamiltonian in the vicinity of this orbit. Following [7, 8, 23, 24, 36], we aim at the\nreduction of the general expressions to certain simple normal forms by suitable canonical\ntransformations. In that way one can identify the parameters that govern the distance to the\nbifurcation. They can be chosen such that \" D 0 brings us on a codimension-one bifurcation\nand the codimension-two scenario is encountered if in addition a D 0.\nFor codimension one the construction (that is carried out for that case in detail e.g. in\n[8] and is recapitulated in appendix A) leads to the Birkhoff normal forms\nm h.m\/.q; p\/\u2212H0\n1 \"q C aq3 C \u001b2p2\n2 \"q2 C aq4 C \u001b2p2\n3 \"I C aI 3=2 cos 3\u001e C bI 2\n4 \"I C aI 2.1C cos 4\u001e\/C bI 2.1\u2212 cos 4\u001e\/\n> 5 \"I C aI 2 CP[m=2]lD3 blI l C cIm=2 cosm\u001e\n: (5)\nFor m > 3 they have been expressed in canonical polar coordinates I , \u001e with\nq D\np\n2I sin\u001e p D\np\n2I cos\u001e: (6)\nThe quantity H0 is a constant.\nThese expressions are autonomous and display the m-fold symmetry even globally.\nThe periodic orbits are mapped onto fixed points @H=@q D 0, @H=@p D 0 and are thus\ndetermined as roots of polynomials in p and q. From Vieta\u2019s relations between these roots\n(or locations of satellites) and the coefficients of the polynomials it follows that orbits\ncollapse on the centre as the lowest-order terms \u0018 \" (and \u0018 a for codimension two) of the\nfixed-point equations are steered to zero.\nTo describe the codimension-two variants we simply have to include higher-order terms\ninto the normal forms to account for additional satellites that approach the centre. This is\ncarried out in appendix A and leads to the extended normal forms\nm H.m\/.q; p\/\u2212H0\n1 \"q C aq3 C bq4 C \u001b2p2\n2 \"q2 C aq4 C bq6 C \u001b2p2\n3 \"I C aI 3=2 cos 3\u001e C bI 2\n4 \"I C aI 2.1C cos 4\u001e\/C bI 2.1\u2212 cos 4\u001e\/C cI 3.1C cos 4\u001e\/\n5 \"I C aI 2 C bI 5=2 cos 5\u001e\n6 \"I C aI 2 C bI 3 C cI 3 cos 6\u001e\n> 7 \"I C aI 2 CP[m=2]lD3 blI l C cIm=2 cosm\u001e\n: (7)\nThe normal forms for m > 5 are the usual Birkhoff normal forms; they will, however, be\ninvestigated not only for small \" but also for small a. The expressions for m 6 4 go exactly\none order beyond the Birkhoff normal forms. The expression for m D 3 actually describes\na scenario of codimension three, since two parameters have to be controlled in order to\nachieve a D 0 (see section A.4).\n3. Local bifurcation scenarios\nWe now discuss in detail the bifurcations of codimension two that are described by the\nnormal forms given in the preceding section. In each case the location of the periodic\npoints, given as the solutions of the fixed-point equations\n@H\n@q\nD 0 @H\n@p\nD 0 (8)\n4172 H Schomerus\nare investigated as the parameters are varied. Sequences of codimension-one bifurcations\nare encountered if only one parameter is varied close to a codimension-two point [23, 24].\nIn principle, all coefficients of the normal form vary with this parameter. Since we are\nonly interested in the qualitative features it suffices to choose \" as the parameter, taking\nfixed values for the others (including a, which we take finite). Representative scenarios\nwill be illustrated by contour plots of the normal forms. Unstable orbits appear there as\nsaddles while stable orbits correspond to maxima or minima. In all these sequences there\nis a period-m bifurcation at \" D 0 and a tangent bifurcation of satellites at the parameter\ncombinations\nm Tangent bifurcation of satellites\n1 \" D \u2212 14 a\n3\nb2\n2 \" D 13 a\n2\nb\n3 \" D 932 a\n2\nb\n4 \" D 23 a\n2\nc\n5 \" D \u2212 128675 a\n3\nb2\n6 \" D \u2212 13 a\n2\nb\u0006c\n> 7 \" \u0019 13 a\n2\nb\n: (9)\nIncidentally, global bifurcations that are of particular interest in the context of uniform\napproximations are discussed in section 5.\n3.1. Tangent bifurcations (m D 1)\nWe begin with the discussion of the individual bifurcation sequences and start with the case\nm D 1.\nIn a tangent bifurcation two orbits of the same primitive period coalesce. On one side\nof the bifurcation both orbits are ghosts, i.e. complex solutions of the fixed-point equations,\nand their coordinates and other characteristic quantities are related by complex conjugation.\nOn the other side of the bifurcation both orbits are real, one of them being initially stable\nand the other unstable. The scenario is described by the normal form h.1\/ which accounts\nfor two periodic orbits \u0006 at coordinates p\u0006 D 0 and\nq\u0006 D \u0006\nr\n\u22121\n3\n\"\na\n: (10)\nOne often encounters a third orbit of identical period in close neighbourhood (in phase\nspace) to the bifurcating orbits. This orbit must be taken into account, for instance, to\nobtain a reasonable semiclassical approximation. One then has to work with the extended\nnormal form H.1\/. The fixed-point equation @H=@q D 0 is a real cubic polynomial in q\nand has three solutions. The number of real solutions is determined by the sign of the\ndiscriminant\nD D\n\u0012\n1\n8\n\"\nb\n\u00132\nC 1\n4\n\"\nb\n\u0012\n1\n4\na\nb\n\u00133\n: (11)\nThere are three real solutions for D < 0 and only one for D > 0 which is then accompanied\nby two complex ones. Tangent bifurcations are encountered at D D 0, that is \" D 0 or\n\" D \u2212a3=.4b2\/.\nA sequence of these two tangent bifurcations is depicted in figure 1. The codimension-\ntwo bifurcation is obtained when \" and a pass zero simultaneously. If this is done in such\na way that the discriminant changes sign then the number of solutions changes from one\nPeriodic orbits near bifurcations of codimension two 4173\nFigure 1. Contour plots of the normal form H.1\/ as the parameters are steered to cross two\ntangent bifurcations close to the bifurcation point of codimension two. Initially, only one orbit\nis present. Two new orbits are born in a tangent bifurcation. One of them approaches the first\norbit, and both annihilate in an inverse tangent bifurcation. A similar scenario exists in which\nstable orbits are unstable and vice versa; it is obtained by reversing the sign of \u001b .\nFigure 2. The typical sequence for m D 2 of a tangent bifurcation of period-two satellites\nand a period-doubling bifurcation is illustrated by contour plots of H.2\/. As for m D 1 there\nexists a similar scenario for the opposite sign of \u001b in which the stability of orbits is changed.\nThe tangent bifurcation would not be encountered in real phase space if the satellites meet at a\nnegative value of I .\nto three in a pitchfork bifurcation. Such a bifurcation is even of codimension one if the\nsystem is time-reversal symmetric or has a reflection symmetry [16\u201320].\n3.2. Period-doubling bifurcation (m D 2) and tangent bifurcation of satellites\nIn a period-doubling bifurcation the central orbit changes its stability by absorbing or\nemitting a satellite of double period.

The contour plots of the normal form H.3\/ display a sequence of a tangent bifurcation\nof satellites and a period-tripling bifurcation.\n3.3. Period-tripling bifurcation (m D 3) and tangent bifurcation of satellites\nThe situation for the period tripling is visualized in the sequence of contour plots in figure 3.\nInitially, a stable periodic orbit of period one is surrounded by its stability island. At a\ncertain value of the control parameter two satellites of triple period come into existence\nvia a tangent bifurcation. Then the inner (unstable) satellite approaches the central orbit,\ncollides with it in the period tripling, and finally re-emerges on the other side. This scenario\nhas been investigated, for instance, in the diamagnetic Kepler problem [37] and for the\nkicked top [21].\nThe Birkhoff normal form h.3\/ describes the central orbit at I D 0 and the unstable\nsatellite that is involved in the tripling. The \u001e-coordinate of the satellite obeys @h.3\/=@\u001e D\n\u22123aI 3=2 sin 3\u001e D 0. Since a threefold symmetry is implied by this equation it suffices\nto consider the second equation @h.3\/=@I D 0 on the p-axis after switching back to the\ncoordinates p; q, yielding \"p C 3p8ap2 D 0. Hence the canonical radial coordinate of the\nsatellite is I D p2=2 D 4\"2=.9a2\/.\nIn the extended normal form H.3\/ the \u001e-coordinates of the satellites again obey\n\u22123aI 3=2 sin 3\u001e D 0. On the p-axis they now satisfy \"pC 3p8ap2 C bp3 D 0. This equation\nhas three solutions,\np0 D 0 p\u0006 D \u2212 3\n4\np\n2\na\nb\n\u0006\nr\n9\n32\na2\nb2\n\u2212 \"\nb\n:\nOne in fact sees that the inclusion of the next-order term implies the existence of a\nfurther satellite. At \" D 9a2=.32b\/ the satellites undergo a tangent bifurcation and for\n\"=b > 9a2=.32b2\/ both satellites are ghosts. For 0 < \"=b < 9a2=.32b2\/ both satellites are\non the same side of the central orbit, while after the period tripling (\" D 0) they lie opposite\nto each other. In the limit \"=b ! \u22121 the satellites form a broken torus, well separated\nfrom the central orbit. Three parameters have to be varied in order to achieve a D \" D 0,\nas explained in section A.4. Both satellites are then contracted onto the central orbit in a\ncodimension-three bifurcation.\n3.4. Period-quadrupling bifurcation (m D 4) and tangent bifurcations of satellites\nThere are two variants of generic period-quadrupling bifurcations depending on the\nmagnitude of the coefficients a and b in the normal form h.4\/. In both cases there are\ntwo satellites of quadruple period involved that lie at sin 4\u001e D 0 and are distinguished\nby the quantity cos 4\u001e D \u00061 \u0011 \u001b . Their radial distance is given by I .\u001bD1\/ D \u2212\"=.4a\/\nand I .\u001bD\u22121\/ D \u2212\"=.4b\/. In the touch-and-go case sign a D \u2212 sign b an unstable satellite\nbecomes a ghost while in turn a ghost solution becomes real and emerges from the central\norbit. In the island-chain scenario sign a D sign b there are two ghost satellites on one side\nPeriodic orbits near bifurcations of codimension two 4175\nFigure 4. The two sequences of contour plots of H.4\/ display a tangent bifurcation of satellites\nfollowed by a period-quadrupling bifurcation. The latter is encountered in its island-chain version\nabove; below we have the touch-and-go scenario.\nof the bifurcation and two real satellites on the other, one of them being stable and the other\nunstable.\nThe next-order terms in the extended normal form QH.4\/ equation (A5) involve three\nnew parameters c, d and e and give rise to six satellites. For e D 0 there are two satellites\non the lines cos 4\u001e D 1 and two on the lines cos 4\u001e D \u22121 as well as the two satellites\ndiscussed in the derivation of the normal form H.4\/. There is a tangent bifurcation at\n2a2 D 3\"c where the satellites on cos 4\u001e D 1 coalesce, and another one at 2b2 D 3\"d\nthat involves the satellites on cos 4\u001e D \u22121. A great variety of possible configurations of\nall six satellites exists. Here, however, we are only concerned with the codimension-two\nbifurcation, described by H.4\/ and encountered for \" D a D 0. It involves only three\nsatellites, those on the lines cos 4\u001e D 1 with radial coordinates\nI\n.1\/\n\u0006 D \u2212\n1\n3\na\nc\n\u0006\ns\n1\n9\na2\nc2\n\u2212 1\n6\n\"\nc\n(15)\nand that satellite with cos 4\u001e D \u22121 which is closer to the centre and lies with H.4\/ at\nI .\u22121\/ D \u2212\"=.4b\/. Compared with the situation described by QH.4\/ the second satellite on the\nline cos 4\u001e D \u22121 is shifted to infinity; the two satellites at I D .b\u2212a\/=d have now angular\ncoordinates cos 4\u001e \u0019 \u22125 and are therefore ghosts. (Certainly they may eventually become\nreal at finite values of \" and a, far away from the codimension-two bifurcation and therefore\nout of the scope of this work.) A tangent bifurcation is met at \" D 2a2=.3c\/ provided that\nI D \u2212a=.3c\/ > 0, since the Cartesian coordinates (6) are otherwise imaginary. Sequences\nof a tangent bifurcation at positive I and the two variants of quadrupling bifurcations are\nshown in figure 4.\n3.5. Period-m bifurcation with m > 5 and tangent bifurcations of satellites\nThe codimension-one bifurcations for m > 5 follow the island-chain pattern already\nencountered for m D 4. There are two satellites that are ghosts on one side of the\n4176 H Schomerus\nFigure 5.

The\nstable and unstable periodic points form a chain similar to the broken rational tori that\nappear in almost integrable systems. Indeed, the \u001e-dependent terms in the normal forms\nare of the form of a small perturbation in that situation.\nFor m > 5 the usual Birkhoff normal forms describe even the codimension-\ntwo bifurcations: in addition to the orbits participating in the period-m bifurcation of\ncodimension one they also account for the satellites that are involved in the subsequent\ntangent bifurcations. In the case m D 5 one obtains three satellites at sin 5\u001e D 0 that satisfy\non the p-axis\n\" C ap2 C 5\n4\np\n2\nbp3 D 0: (16)\nAs for m D 1 it is the discriminant\nD D 2\n\u0012\n2\n5\n\"\nb\n\u00132\nC 2\n5\n\"\nb\n\u0012\n8\n15\na\nb\n\u00133\n(17)\nof the equation that governs the number of real solutions. There is the period-5 bifurcation\nat \" D 0 and a tangent bifurcation at \" D \u2212128a3=.675b2\/. That sequence is depicted in\nfigure 5.\nIn the case m D 6 one finds four satellites, two on each of the lines cos 6\u001e D \u00061 \u0011 \u001b\nat\nI\n.\u001b\/\n\u0006 D \u2212\n1\n3\na\nb C \u001bc \u0006\ns\n1\n9\na2\n.b C \u001bc\/2 \u2212\n1\n3\n\"\nb C \u001bc : (18)\nTangent bifurcations take place at independent parameter combinations \" D a2=[3.bC \u001bc\/]\n(provided that the I -coordinate is not negative). A sequence with two tangent bifurcations\nat positive values of I is shown in figure 6. All four satellites approach the centre in the\ncodimension-two bifurcation as \" and a are sent to zero.\nFor m > 7 there are even more satellites in the Birkhoff normal form than the four that\nparticipate in the codimension-two scenario. In first order, the relevant satellites lie on the\nlines cosm\u001e D \u00061 \u0011 \u001b at a radial distance\nI\n.\u001b\/\n\u0006 D \u2212\n1\n3\na\nb\n\u0006\ns\n1\n9\na2\nb2\n\u2212 1\n3\n\"\nb\n(19)\nwhich is independent of \u001b . The \u001e-dependent term induces a small correction of order\n\u001bIm=2\u22122. Before the tangent bifurcations, which are encountered at almost identical values\n\" \u0019 a2=.3b\/, both satellite pairs have complex I . After the bifurcation both the inner as\nwell as the outer orbits form island chains that are visible in phase space if the I -coordinate\nis positive. The corresponding sequence is shown in figure 7.\nPeriodic orbits near bifurcations of codimension two 4177\nFigure 6. Varying a parameter close to the codimension-two point with m D 6, one might\nobserve two pairs of satellites being born in a tangent bifurcation at positive I , as displayed\nhere; the satellites closer to the centre disappear in a subsequent period-6 bifurcation. The island\nchain that is left over here could be also steered to the centre by letting a, and then again \"\nchanges its sign.\nFigure 7. For m > 7 the resonant \u001e-dependence of the normal form is weak, and tangent\nbifurcations of satellite pairs occur at almost identical values. Subsequently the inner island\nchain collapses onto the centre and disappears. The remaining chain might follow, as explained\nfor m D 6.\n3.6. Absence of alternative bifurcation sequences\nIt is an interesting observation that no sequences of period-m bifurcations followed by\nnontangent bifurcations are encountered in the unfoldings. A prominent example would be\ntaken from a period-doubling cascade, where an orbit of period n0 appears as a satellite in\na period-doubling bifurcation and has initially trM.n0\/ D 2; subsequently it coalesces with\na satellite of twice its period at trM.n0\/ D \u22122. However, we see immediately that both\nbifurcations cannot be contracted on a single point in control space, since this would lead\nto a singular change of trM.n0\/, i.e. the stability properties of the orbit in question.\nThis reasoning also carries over to other alternative variants of sequences\u2014the\nbifurcations cannot be contracted in control space on a bifurcation of higher codimension\u2014\nthis again would entail a singular change in the stability properties of the orbits.\nAs we explain now in general, only the scenarios with a single central orbit and one\nkind of satellites are admissible: since we consider here unfoldings, there is a certain point\nin parameter space where all bifurcations happen simultaneously. This fixes trM.rn0\/ at\nthe bifurcations in the sequence for each orbit and its repetitions. Specifically, the central\norbit of primitive period n0 has trM.n0\/ D 2 cos.2\u0019l=m\/ with l and m relatively prime and\ncan therefore only coalesce with satellites of period mn0. These satellites, on the other\nhand, have trM.mn0\/ D 2 at the period-m bifurcation in the unfolding, which only allows\nfor tangent bifurcations with orbits of identical length as an alternative to the period-m\nbifurcation with the central orbit.\nHow would one then deal with cascades? Observe that the various bifurcations will\nappear at different iterations of the map. We find that the most important scenarios can\nbe studied by iterating the normal-form maps of codimension one, but leave this for future\ninvestigations.\n4178 H Schomerus\n4. Semiclassical approximations\nWe investigate now the impact of bifurcations on semiclassical trace formulae. For\nautonomous systems with Hamiltonian H we study the trace of the retarded Green function\nG.E\/ D 1\nE C i0C \u2212H (20)\nwhich provides the density of states by\nd.E\/ D \u2212 1\n\u0019\nIm trG.E\/: (21)\nPeriodically driven systems are described stroboscopically by a time-evolution operator F .\nFor convenience we set the stroboscopic period to unity. F represents in general the unitary\noperator of a quantum map with a classical limit. The eigenstates of F are stroboscopically\nstationary, and the phases of the unimodular eigenvalues are called quasienergies. The\nquasienergy spectrum is encoded in the traces trFn.\nIt is convenient to consider in the following trFn and ih\u00af trG.E\/, the factor being\nintroduced to facilitate a parallel investigation of both cases.\n4.1. Periodic orbits in semiclassical approximations\nA semiclassical link between these traces and isolated periodic orbits is provided\nby Gutzwiller\u2019s trace formula [1\u20134]. The expression is regained from the uniform\napproximations to be derived in the limit h\u00af! 0 and is therefore of fundamental importance.\nThe traces are given as a sum over the periodic orbits of given energy E or stroboscopic\nperiod n, where each orbit contributes\nC.sp\/ D T0\nexp[ i\nh\u00af\nS.n0r\/ \u2212 i\u00192\u0016]\nj2\u2212 trM.n0r\/j1=2 : (22)\nIn the periodically driven case, T0 D n0 is the primitive stroboscopic period that was\nintroduced in section 2. (Recall that we set the stroboscopic period to unity.) For\nautonomous systems, the orbits show up as fixed points in the Poincare\u00b4 map on a surface\nof section. The primitive period T0 is then the time T after which one first comes back to\nthe initial point when starting somewhere on the trajectory of the periodic orbit. The orbit\nshows up as a fixed point in all n-step maps on the surface of section where, as before,\nn D rn0, and r D T=T0 is an integer counting repetitions.\nBesides the period, three canonical invariant characteristic quantities of periodic points\nenter, the action S.n\/, the stability factor trM.n\/, and the Maslov index \u0016. They will also\ndetermine the uniform approximations.\nThe action S is given by the value of\n8.q; p\/ D OS.n\/.q; p\/\u2212 qp (23)\nat the periodic point, where OS.n\/.qn; p0\/ is the generating function of the n-step map\n.q0; p0\/! .qn; pn\/,\n@ OS.n\/\n@qn\nD pn @\nOS.n\/\n@p0\nD q0 (24)\nwith in addition @ OS.n\/\n@E\nD T in the autonomous case (in which we refer to the nth iterate of\nthe Poincare\u00b4 map). The linearized n-step map M.n\/ was likewise introduced in section 2.\nPeriodic orbits near bifurcations of codimension two 4179\nIt is connected to the second derivatives of OS.n\/ and involved in the expression through its\ntrace\ntrM.n\/ D\n1C\n\u0010\n@2 OS.n\/\n@qn@p0\n\u00112\n\u2212 @2 OS.n\/\n@q2n\n@2 OS.n\/\n@p20\n@2 OS.n\/\n@qn@p0\n: (25)\nFinally, there is the Maslov index \u0016 D \u0017 \u2212 12 sign800 where \u0017 is the Morse index and\nsign800 denotes the difference in the number of positive and negative eigenvalues of the\nmatrix\n800 D\n \n@28\n@q2n\n@28\n@qn@p0\n@28\n@qn@p0\n@28\n@p20\n!\n(26)\ninvolving second derivatives of 8.\nThe isolated contribution (22) may be derived via a stationary-phase approximation from\nthe integral (see [8, 10])\nC0 D 12\u0019h\u00af\nZ\n0\ndq 0 dp9.q 0; p\/ exp\n\u0014\ni\nh\u00af\n8.q 0; p\/\u2212 i\u0019\n2\n\u0017\n\u0015\n(27)\nwhich gives the semiclassical contribution of an arbitrarily chosen region 0 on the surface\nof section or phase space. This integral will serve as a starting point for the derivation of\ncollective contributions of bifurcating periodic orbits.

In the two-\nparameter family of Hamiltonians (1) the stationary-phase approximation is in danger close\n4180 H Schomerus\nto bifurcations of codimension one and two. In practical applications with small but finite\nvalues of h\u00af, bifurcations are felt in a finite range in parameter space. Even bifurcations of\ncodimension two or higher are typically felt when only a single parameter (frequently, none\nat all) is varied. This observation (see for example [30, 21, 22]) is indeed our principal\nincentive.\nCollective contributions of orbits which yield regular expressions close to bifurcations\nof codimension one as a substitute for the stationary-phase result (22) have been investigated\nin [7\u201312]. For the derivation of collective contributions of codimension two we proceed\nanalogous to these previous works.\nThe starting point is provided by the integral (27). Normal forms for the phase\nfunction 8 and the amplitude function 9 that supersede the quadratic form (32) are then\nderived by demanding that they lead to uniform collective contributions when inserted\ninto the integral (27). As mentioned in the introduction, besides being regular close\nto the bifurcation, such approximations split asymptotically into the sum of individual\ncontributions (22) of the bifurcating orbits with the correct phases and amplitudes.\nIn section 2 we observed that the Hamiltonian normal forms describe in some cases\nadditional orbits that do not participate in the bifurcations of codimension two. In addition\nthey do not provide enough coefficients to yield independent actions and semiclassical\namplitudes in the stationary-phase approximation. Sieber [10], partly in collaboration with\nthis author [11, 12], has shown for codimension-one bifurcations how to overcome these\nrestrictions in a systematic way. One has to consider the influence of higher-order terms in\nthe normal forms on the classical properties of the orbits. These terms can be eliminated in\nthe region of almost stationary phase by noncanonical transformations. Such transformations\ncan also be used to get rid of the additional nonbifurcating orbits described by the original\nnormal form. The Jacobian of the transformation enters the amplitude function 9, which\ncan be simplified further by partial integrations. The procedure is carried out in appendix B.\nIt results in the following normal forms for 8 and 9,\nm 8.m\/.q 0; p\/\u2212 S0\n1 \u2212\"q 02 \u2212 aq 03 \u2212 bq 04 \u2212 \u001b2p2\n2 \u2212\"q 02 \u2212 aq 04 \u2212 bq 06 \u2212 \u001b2p2\n3 \u2212\"I \u2212 aI 3=2 cos 3\u001e \u2212 bI 2\n4 \u2212\"I \u2212 aI 2.1C cos 4\u001e\/\u2212 bI 2.1\u2212 cos 4\u001e\/\u2212 cI 3.1C cos 4\u001e\/\n5 \u2212\"I \u2212 aI 2 \u2212 bI 5=2 cos 5\u001e \u2212 \"cI 3=2 cos 5\u001e\n6 \u2212\"I \u2212 aI 2 \u2212 bI 3 \u2212 cI 3 cos 6\u001e \u2212 \"dI 2 cos 6\u001e\n> 7; odd \u2212\"I \u2212 aI 2 \u2212 bI 3 \u2212 I 3=2.cI C \"d\/ cosm\u001e\n> 8; even \u2212\"I \u2212 aI 2 \u2212 bI 3 \u2212 I 2.cI C \"d\/ cosm\u001e\n(33)\nm 9.m\/.q 0; p\/\n1 1C \u000bq 0 C \fq 02\n2 1C \u000bq 02 C \fq 04\n3 1C \u000bI C \fI 3=2 cos 3\u001e\n4 1C \u000bI C \fI 2 C \u03b3 I 2 cos 4\u001e C \u000eI 3\n5 1C .\u000b C \fI\/I 1=2 cos 5\u001e C \u03b3 I C \u000eI 2\n6 1C .\u000b C \fI\/I cos 6\u001e C \u03b3 I C \u000eI 2 C \u0018I 3\n> 7; odd 1C .\u000b C \fI\/I 1=2 cosm\u001e C \u03b3 I C \u000eI 2 C \u0018I 3\n> 8; even 1C .\u000b C \fI\/I cosm\u001e C \u03b3 I C \u000eI 2 C \u0018I 3\n: (34)\nIn 8.1;2\/ we may choose j\u001b j D 1. The normal forms for m > 3 are expressed in canonical\npolar coordinates I , \u001e defined in equation (6).\nPeriodic orbits near bifurcations of codimension two 4181\nThat these normal forms, in contrast to the Hamiltonian ones, indeed provide just the\nright number of coefficients to account for independent periodic orbits is demonstrated in\nthe following section. Let us already note here that, for instances, a term as \"cI 3=2 cos 5\u001e in\n8.5\/ for m D 5 takes care for independent actions of the four bifurcating orbits. Reviewing\nthe derivation in appendix B we see that it cannot be transformed away within the accuracy\nrequired of a uniform approximation without introducing other terms (like I 3). That this\nterm scales as \" provides additional insight in the expected quality of the approximation: if\nit becomes too large, this hints unduly large influence of higher-order terms, which are in\nturn related to additional satellite orbits. (More stationary points show up when the degree\nof the polynomial increases.) It is then likely required to work with normal forms of even\nhigher codimension.\nNote that some of the extra terms in the normal forms for m > 5 cannot be expressed\n\u2018perturbatively\u2019 as q 0lpk in Cartesian coordinates (6). The substitutions m\u001e D 2 for m\neven and m\u001e D  for m odd provide a potentially useful regularization. The appearance\nof such terms in the phase function 8 is in contrast to the situation of codimension one,\nwhere the higher-order terms can be transformed away completely.\n(Numerically useful expressions for some of the resulting integrals in terms of Taylor\nseries can be found in [30] (m D 1; 2) and [21] (m D 3). The integrals for m D 1; 2\ncan also be easily evaluated by the method of steepest descent (cf section 5) since they\nare essentially one-dimensional. For m > 3, however, a two-dimensional steepest-descent\nmanifold might be quite difficult to construct. It is perhaps more convenient to deform only\nthe I coordinate into the complex, yielding a simple steepest-descent contour for each fixed,\nreal \u001e, and then to perform the \u001e-integral of finite range.)\n4.3. Determination of coefficients\nIn order to obtain uniform collective contributions that split in the stationary-phase limit\ninto a sum of isolated contributions of Gutzwiller type (22) with correct amplitudes and\nphases, one has to express the coefficients in the normal forms by the classical quantities S,\ntrM of the orbits. This is achieved by comparing the individual contributions (22) to (31)\nand described in detail below. Incidentally, also complex solutions of the stationary-phase\ncondition (30) have to be considered in order to obtain enough classical information. These\n\u2018ghost orbits\u2019 are investigated in detail in section 5. The resulting expressions are then\ninvariant under canonical transformations [10\u201312, 38, 39] and are applicable not only in the\nimmediate neighbourhood of the bifurcation, but also far away. (Transitional approximations\nof the type mentioned in the introduction are obtained if one uses9 D 1 instead, and discards\nthe nonperturbative terms in the phase for m > 5.)\nIn detail, the properties of the central orbit determine \" and S0, since the stationary\npoint in the origin gives C.sp\/ D exp[iS0=h\u00af \u2212 i\u00192 .\u0017 C 12 .\u001b C sign \"\/\/]=\npj2\"j for m D 1; 2\n(recall that j\u001b j D 1) and C.sp\/ D exp[iS0=h\u00af\u2212 i\u00192 .\u0017 C sign \"\/]=j\"j for m > 3. The remaining\ncoefficients of the phase function are uniquely determined by the actions of the satellites.\nIt turns out to be helpful to use an ansatz where the coefficients are expressed by scaled\npositions on a radial line connecting the satellites with the central orbit. For even m with\ntwo real satellites on such a line, for instance, we put them on scaled positions at x1 D \u00061,\nx2 D \u0006y, corresponding to\nd8\ndx\nD Ax.x2 \u2212 1\/.x2 \u2212 y2\/ (35)\n4182 H Schomerus\nintegrate to obtain 8.x\/ and determine y from the (scale invariant) ratio\nS1 \u2212 S0\nS2 \u2212 S0 D\n1\u2212 3y2\ny4.y2 \u2212 3\/ : (36)\nWithout restriction we can demand 0 6 y 6 1; then there is exactly one solution.

The right choice takes\ninto consideration whether the ghost with Im S > 0 lies on the steepest-descent contour\nconnecting the integration boundaries or not; see section 5.\nThe approach presented here to obtain the coefficients of 8 works also for the other\nnormal forms. Moreover, the stationary-phase result is a linear combination of the\ncoefficients of the amplitude function 9, which are therefore easily obtained by comparison\nwith the semiclassical amplitudes in (22). For m > 5 there is a symmetry-related pair\nof \u2018spurious\u2019 ghost satellites (analogous to those already discussed for m D 4), which are\nnegligible not only since they do not lie on a steepest-descent contour (see again section 5),\nbut also because a \u2018magic\u2019 cancellation in course of the derivation (see section B.7) entails\n9 D 0 at their positions. Fortunately, exactly one extra term in 9 shows up in these\ncases which can be used to achieve this suppression. It seems reasonable that one uses this\napproach also in the case m D 4, where an extra coefficient is also at one\u2019s disposal.\n5. Stokes transitions\n5.1. Preliminary remarks\nIn the evaluation of the integral representation (27) of contributions to ih\u00af trG.E\/ and trFn,\nthe regions around stationary points come naturally into focus when one uses the steepest-\ndescent method [31\u201333] to find the leading-order term of an asymptotic expansion of the\nintegral in h\u00af. To achieve this goal the integration variables are complexified and the initial\ncontour is deformed such that the maxima lie at the solutions of (30), i.e. the periodic points.\nFrom the maxima one follows paths of steepest descent of the integrand.\nThe new contour has to originate from the original one by a continuous deformation\nwithout crossing singularities. In order to construct a contour that connects the original\nintegration boundaries one automatically visits also some complex \u2018ghost\u2019 solutions of (30).\nThe steepest-descent contour constructed so consists of different sheets of constant phase\nRe8 in the exponent of the integrand, which is given by the real part of the action of the\nperiodic point. For general combinations of the control parameters (codimension zero) there\nwill be only one orbit lying on each sheet, though it is possible that it does so with more\nthan one of the points along its trajectory.\nIn the stationary-phase limit, only contributions of ghosts that lie on the deformed\ncontour survive. We shall investigate which ghosts do contribute for the collective\ncontributions derived in the preceding section. Specifically, we examine how ghosts become\nor cease to be relevant as parameters are changed.\nTo this end, imagine that for one combination of the parameters a ghost lies on the\nsteepest-descent contour while for another one it does not. The ghost is denoted by C in\nthe following and sometimes called \u2018subdominant\u2019 orbit. Its complex conjugate partner is\nPeriodic orbits near bifurcations of codimension two 4183\ndenoted by \u2212. Somewhere on a path connecting both parameter combinations the contour\nchanges its form qualitatively in a so-called Stokes transition: The sheet of the ghost merges\nwith the sheet of another orbit, which is called the \u2018dominant orbit\u2019 and denoted by 0. On\nboth sides of the transition the sheets of the two orbits will connect different zeroes of\nthe integrand. In the transition the contour changes in such a way that the sheet of the\nsubdominant orbit is no longer needed to connect the original integration boundaries.\nA necessary condition that the sheets of two orbits merge is that the real part of their\nactions are identical,\nRe S0 D Re SC: (38)\nIn general, this condition is not sufficient since both sheets could be separated by others.\n(Investigating energies of real orbits, the analogous condition H0 D HC is necessary to find\na heteroclinic orbit; again, additional insight is needed to decide whether an equipotential\ncontour joining both orbits indeed exists. These two global bifurcation types are therefore\nintimately related and constitute, in the language of catastrophe theory, instances of saddle\nconnections.)\n5.2. Stokes transitions in the diffraction integrals\nIn the neighbourhood of codimension-two bifurcations one encounters tangent bifurcations\nin which satellites become ghosts, as was demonstrated in section 3. Subsequently the\nghosts may undergo Stokes transitions with the central orbit. We analyse the transitions by\ninvestigating the expressions for the actions of the central orbit and the ghosts and using\nthe condition (38).\nBesides the tangent bifurcations of the satellites, the unfoldings display also period-\nm bifurcations of codimension one. Let us first demonstrate that no connection can exist\nbetween the sheet of the central orbit and ghosts that are born in such a period-m bifurcations\nof codimension one with m > 2. A helpful rule in that respect is that only ghosts with\nIm8 > 0 can lie on the steepest-descent contour. Moreover, satellites that disappear in\nperiod-m bifurcations of codimension one with even m are afterwards \u2018self-conjugated\u2019\nghosts, that is, map onto themselves under complex conjugation, and have therefore real\nclassical quantities (in canonical polar coordinates they have real \u001e and I < 0); accordingly,\nthey do not contribute. Ghosts immediately beyond a period-m bifurcation of codimension\none with odd m > 5 have almost real action, a small imaginary part only being introduced\nfrom higher orders, and also do not contribute: in the vicinity of these bifurcations, the\nghosts are practically self-conjugated, since the \u001e-dependent terms in the normal forms of\n8 act only as a small perturbation (see for example, the expressions for the actions in\n[10]); their presence results only in a slight distortion of the contours, but does not change\nthe situation qualitatively. Since no ghosts are involved in period-tripling bifurcations,\nwe conclude that indeed it suffices to concentrate on ghosts which are born at tangent\nbifurcations of satellites.\nFor these ghosts, however, it cannot be avoided to construct the contour in order to find\nout whether they are relevant or not. (In practical calculations, though, one may be guided\nby the observation that the majority of relevant ghosts will be close to reality, i.e. about to\nbifurcate.) Fortunately, it is not difficult to realize that the condition (38) is indeed sufficient\nfor ghosts beyond tangent bifurcations. The reasoning is facilitated by the observation that\nthe problem can be reduced in all cases to one dimension by considering the I -lines (or, to\nbe precise, the complex I -planes) \u001e mod \u0019 D const that connect the central orbit and the\nghost satellites radially.\n4184 H Schomerus\nFigure 8. Path of steepest descent Re8.1\/.q; 0\/ D S0 (heavy curve). The\nparameters are chosen to fulfill the condition for a Stokes transition. The\ntransition indeed takes place since the contour connects the subdominant ghost\nwith the dominant central orbit. The light curves are the equipotential lines of\nj exp[i8]j (or Im8).\n5.2.1. The cases m D 1, m D 3. For m D 1 and m D 3 the situation is simple since there\nare no other orbits than the two satellites (which are the ghosts in question) and the central\norbit. Actually, the functional form of 8.3\/ on the radial line is identical to that of 8.1\/\non the line p D 0, which allows a parallel treatment. The diffraction integral for m D 1\ninvolves Pearcey\u2019s integral (and its derivatives) for which the Stokes transitions have been\nstudied by Wright [40]. In the construction of 8.1\/ the real solution has been placed in the\norigin, q 00 D p0 D 0.

The case of even m. For even m, all normal forms are an even polynomial of degree\nsix in the distance \u0018 I 1=2 on the radial line, and the problem is mapped onto the case\nm D 2. We already determined the locations (13) of the orbits for the Hamiltonian normal\nform H.2\/. By convention, coefficients changed sign in the definition of 8.2\/, but this does\nnot affect the coordinates of the orbits.

Dashed lines indicate steepest-descent paths that\nare not needed to connect the integration boundaries. A trick can be played with these pictures\nto envision the situation for the tangent bifurcation at negative I : the plots are rotated by 90\ndegrees (which corresponds to inverting the sign of a), and the contour is picked that originally\nconnects \u0006i1 (see also figure 10).\nFigure 10.

The Stokes transition at a D 0 involves a ghost with a nonvanishing imaginary\npart of the action. Figure 9 shows how the integration contour changes in the complex q 0-\nplane due to the tangent bifurcation and the Stokes transition. The plots prove the existence\nof a path that connects both sheets at constant Re8.\nDifferent situations with Re S\u0006 D S0 appear, however, for \" D 14 a\n2\nb\n. No Stokes transition\noccurs there because the satellite involved is real for ab < 0 and a ghost with real action\nand real I < 0 for ab > 0. Figure 10 confirms that indeed the contours are separated by\nanother \u2018real ghost\u2019 (broken contour).\n5.2.3. The case m D 5. For m D 5 the phase function on the p-axis is a polynomial\nof degree five. It initially appears that the three satellites could be arranged in such a\nway that the sheet of the ghost C is separated from the sheet of the central orbit 0 by the\nremaining real satellite 1. One easily finds, however, that the sheets are separated for the\nparticular phase function only if the real parts of the three roots p\u0006, p1 of equation (16)\nall have the same sign, which in turn can be ruled out by a careful inspection of equation\n(16): from Vieta\u2019s relations it follows that otherwise the coefficient of the linear term\n\u0018 [pCp\u2212 C .pC Cp\u2212\/p1] would not vanish. Note that the order I 3=2 in 8.5\/ indeed results\nin a nonvanishing coefficient but is considered, as usually, only as a perturbation and does\nnot alter the situation qualitatively. The existence of a steepest-descent connection of the\nghost and the central orbit at the Stokes transition is then guaranteed also for m D 5. The\ntransition takes place at the value of t \u0011 75\"b2=.4a3\/ that is the solution of\n640C 1520t\n3\nC 925t\n2\n9\nC t3 D 0 (43)\n4186 H Schomerus\nclose to t D \u221297:6566. To derive this equation we first reduce the expression for Re S\u2212S0\nwith help of the fixed-point equation\n8t C 75r2.4C 5r\/ D 0 (44)\nfor the scaled variable r \u0018 p to the form Re [300r2 C t .8\u2212 10r C 75r2\/] D 0. Introducing\nr D .x C iy\/ here and in the fixed-point equation and splitting the latter into real and\nimaginary part, one can solve then for y2 D 8x=5C 3x2 and t D 15x.2C 5x\/2 and obtains\nthe cubic equation 8C 60x C 125x2 C 75x3 D 0. Its roots give three values for t which all\nsolve (44). Only one of the roots, however, fulfils y2 D 8x=5C 3 > 0; this is the one that\ncorresponds to the approximate value of t given above.\n5.2.4. The case of odd m > 7. For odd m > 7 there are four different satellites on each\nline. They are generically grouped in pairs that lie on opposite sides of the centre, and the\nsituation is similar to m D 2 with slightly broken reflection symmetry. The actions of orbits\nwhich lie opposite to each other deviate only due to the influence of the \u001e-dependent terms\nin the phase function. These are for m > 7 of higher order than the leading-order terms\n\u2212\"I \u2212 aI 2\u2212 bI 3. The symmetry breaking is therefore neglegible for small \" (and even for\nsmall a); the results for m D 2 are then directly applicable to this case.\n6. Conclusions\nWe studied bifurcations of codimension two in Hamiltonian systems that are either\nautonomous and have two degrees of freedom or periodic with one degree of freedom.\nThe normal forms presented in section 2 and discussed in section 3 show that the typical\nsequence of codimension-one bifurcations in the neighbourhood (in parameter space) of the\nbifurcation of codimension two consists of a period-m bifurcation at a central orbit followed\nby a tangent bifurcation in which satellites become ghosts.\nAdditional generic scenarios are encountered in the presence of symmetries [16\u201320].\nIsochronous pitchfork bifurcations are the most important addition of codimension one in the\ncase of time-reversal or reflection symmetries; they will also show up in the neighbourhood\nof codimension-two bifurcations in these systems.\nOnly a small number of the bifurcations of codimension one and two correspond to\n(special cases of) a so-called elementary catastrophe due to Thom (see e.g. [41, 42]). These\nappear in many different contexts and describe, for instance, bifurcations of codimension\nup to four in maps that are not restricted by area preservation. We use the usual names\nand symbols and further denote each Hamiltonian bifurcation type by .mk\/, where m is\nthe multiplicity and k D 1; 2 the codimension. The fold A2 corresponds to the tangent\nbifurcation .11\/. The cusp A3 is .12\/, and .21\/ is a cusp with a reflection symmetry. .22\/\nis a butterfly A5 with reflection symmetry. The period-tripling bifurcation .31\/ corresponds\nto a version of the elliptic umbilic D\u22124 . All other normal forms describe catastrophes\nthat would be of much higher codimension without area preservation. Especially for the\ncases m > 3 one has to rely on higher-order perturbation theory. It implies that (i) for a\ngiven codimension the class of bifurcations in Hamiltonian systems is considerably larger\nand (ii) although this can be circumvented by considering a normal form of much higher\ncodimension from ordinary catastrophe theory, these normal forms have then again to be\nrestricted: points that correspond to the trajectory of one and the same orbit lie on the same\nheight (energy or action). The classical perturbation theory takes care of this and in addition\ngives the right codimension.\nPeriodic orbits near bifurcations of codimension two 4187\nCollective contributions to semiclassical traces were derived that involve normal forms\nfor a phase function 8 and an amplitude function 9. The expressions involve just as\nmany coefficients as are determined by the actions and stability properties of the bifurcating\norbits, including a suppression of certain unwanted ghosts for m > 4. The expressions\nconstitute uniform approximations: they are also valid far away from the bifurcation and\nasymptotically take the form of a sum of isolated contributions (22).\nThe validity of the approximations given here is limited if additional orbits become\nimportant or \u2018unwanted\u2019 ghosts become real; bifurcations of even higher codimension are\nthen to be studied. The basic steps would be the same as in the present study: derivation\nof Hamiltonian normal forms that account for all bifurcating orbits; reduction of normal\nforms to get rid of nonbifurcating orbits and to account for independent stabilities and\nactions. An important open question is concerned with the complexity of periodic-orbit\nclusters typically encountered in the quest of resolving spectra when one approaches the\nsemiclassical limit. This requires knowledge of the dynamics up to the Heisenberg time\n\u0018 1=h\u00af and involves a competition of increasing resolution in phase space and proliferation\nof periodic orbits.\nOne might also be concerned about cascades, which are sequences of bifurcations of a\ncertain orbit of period n at differing values of trM.n\/ D 2 cos! (cf sections 2.2 and 3.6). The\nmost prominent example is the basic building block of period-doubling cascades: an orbit of\nperiod 2n is born at an orbit of period n in a period-doubling bifurcation (trM.2n\/ D 2) and\nperiod doubles itself at trM.2n\/ D \u22122. A huge variety of cascades exists, however, since\nbifurcations happen whenever the stability angle ! is a rational multiple of 2\u0019 . We argued\nin section 3.6 that bifurcations in such a cascade cannot be encountered simultaneously in\nparameter space, since this would imply a singular change in the linearized map. For that\nreason cascades cannot be regarded as unfoldings of bifurcations of higher codimension.\nThe bifurcations in an unfolding show up simultaneously in a given iteration of the map;\nthe cascades involve bifurcations that appear in distinct iterations. One could study, for\ninstance, those cascades that arise from the iteration of the map generated by a normal\nform, and ask the question whether situations exist in which the orbits in the cascade must\nbe treated collectively; it would be indeed nice to see that one can do without. An argument\nin favour of this expectation has been given in [7].\nThe uniform approximations derived here display Stokes transitions in which ghost\nsatellites interact once more with the central orbit and leave the steepest-descent integration\ncontour. Stokes transitions are of great practical importance, since they determine the\nrelevance of ghosts in the semiclassical limit. The ghosts which can undergo Stokes\ntransitions originate from the tangent bifurcations of the unfoldings. Ghost satellites are\nalso born in the period-m bifurcations of the unfoldings, but for m > 2 these ghosts do not\nlie on the steepest-descent contour already directly beyond the bifurcation.\nFrom the experience with the kicked top [22] one can conclude that a reasonable\nsemiclassical quantization scheme for mixed systems has to rely on uniform approximations\nof codimension two, and that Stokes transitions have to be taken into consideration. It is\nwell possible, however, that much more effort is required when the semiclassical limit\nis pushed further; periodic-orbit clusters of higher codimension might come into focus as\nthe number of periodic orbits with length up to the relevant time scale (Heisenberg time)\nincreases drastically.\n4188 H Schomerus\nAcknowledgments\nThe author thanks F Haake, C Howls, J Keating, D Sadovski\u0131\u00b4 and M Sieber for helpful\ndiscussions.

Derivation of normal forms of the Hamiltonian\nWe derive here the Hamiltonian normal forms (7) for the codimension-two bifurcations.\nThe procedure is due to Birkhoff [26] and is nicely exposed for example in [8, 24]. In the\ncase of codimension one, it leads to the normal forms (5). In this situation, care has only\nto be taken in identifying the relevant terms in the expansion for a complete, but simple\ndescription of the slightly more complicated bifurcation scenarios in question.\nIn the derivation of the normal forms (5) and (7) the central orbit is placed into the\norigin of a local coordinate system .q; p\/ by a time-dependent canonical transformation.\nThis is done in such a way that a Taylor expansion in q and p yields\nH.q; p; t\/ D H0 C !2 q\n2 C \u001b\n2\np2 CO.3\/ (A1)\nwith time-independent ! and \u001b . The remainder in the expansion indicates third and higher\norders in q and p. The new Hamiltonian will be n0-periodic but otherwise as general as\nthe one we started with. Hence it suffices to study the case n0 D 1.\nOne passes to a rotating coordinate system, where the angular frequency 2\u0019l=m is\nadopted to the motion around the centre at the bifurcation, and examines the expansion of\nthe Hamiltonian in a Taylor series in q and p as well as a Fourier series in t . Most terms\nin the expansion can be removed by canonical transformations (specified below) up to a\ncertain order in p, q and the deviations of the parameters \", a that govern the distance\nto the bifurcation. The expansion is carried out up to a certain degree, requiring that no\nbifurcating orbits are added or qualitatively affected by the omitted higher-order terms.\nA.1. The cases m D 1; 2\nThe linearized map M has degenerate eigenvalues 1 for m D 1 and \u22121 for m D 2.\nThis entails that the corresponding bifurcation scenarios of codimension one and two\nare essentially one-dimensional. The reason is that the linearized map is in these cases\ngenerically not diagonalizable: otherwise one would have located the matrix M D \u00061 in\nthe three-dimensional manifold Sp.2;R\/ of real 2\u0002 2 matrices with detM D 1 [36]. With\nonly two parameters at one\u2019s disposal, however, one generically finds only such matrices\nwith trM D \u00062 for which the eigenspace is one-dimensional. The linearized map describes\nthen a shear transformation and acts as the identity in only one direction.\nThe reasoning can be put onto another footing by resolving the apparent paradox\nthat we can cast the second-order terms into a diagonal form !q2=2 C \u001bp2=2 in the\nimmediate neighbourhood of the bifurcation, which involves only two parameters. This\ndiagonalization, however, depends in a singular way on the parameters of the original\nexpansion a1q2 C a2p2 C a3qp. (Note that all three terms are C1- and C2-invariant.)\nAccordingly, three coefficients ai are to be controlled in order to let the second order\nvanish. Such an argumentation will be used again for m D 4.\nWe choose the q-axis as the line on which orbits approach each other at the bifurcation.\nIn the p-direction it is only the quadratic term which effectively influences the characteristic\nPeriodic orbits near bifurcations of codimension two 4189\nproperties of the orbits (energy and stability; subsequently also action). This reduction\nparallels the famous splitting lemma of catastrophe theory.\nWith a suitable scaling transformation one can achieve j\u001b j D 1. The normal form for\nm D 2 is symmetric in q since in that case the coordinate system rotates by \u0019 in each\nperiod.\nA.2. The cases m > 3\nFor m > 3 the central orbit is stable close to the bifurcation so that we can achieve \u001b D !\nin (A1), entailing trM D 2 cos!. It is then convenient to use canonical polar coordinates\n(6). In the rotating coordinate system the leading-order term in I takes the form \"I with\n\" D !\u22122\u0019 l\nm\nin agreement with the bifurcation condition (4).

The coefficient\nGkl0m0 diverges at the bifurcation if the resonance condition l0 D l m0m is met. This affects,\nfor instance, all t- and \u001e-independent terms (l0 D m0 D 0). The remaining \u001e-dependent\nterms are of type I k=2 cos.nm\u001e \u2212 Q\u001ekn\/. Here n D 1; 2; 3; : : : is an integer since l and m\nare relatively prime, and k > nm as before.

A shift of \u001e eliminates the constant in the cosine.\nIf the coefficient of this term is not small then one can get rid of constants Q\u001ek1 in higher\norders k > m by a transformation of the form \u001e D \u0012 CP1k0D1 gk0I k0 with suitably chosen\ncoefficients.\nA.3. Further reduction for m D 4\nAdditional considerations are needed for m D 4. The most general expression that goes one\norder beyond the Birkhoff normal form reads\nQH.4\/H0 C \"I C aI 2.1C cos 4\u001e\/C bI 2.1\u2212 cos 4\u001e\/\nC.c C d\/I 3 C .c \u2212 d\/I 3 cos 4\u001e C eI 3 sin 4\u001e: (A5)\nThe codimension-two bifurcation is approached for vanishing \" and a (or b), while the other\nsecond-order coefficient b (or a) is finite. Both cases are equivalent and mapped onto each\nother by a rotation about \u0019=4. The normal form H.4\/ has been written down for small a.\nSince b is finite we can eliminate two of the three third-order terms in (A5) by a canonical\n4190 H Schomerus\ntransformation and achieve d D e D 0. (The corresponding generating function is of the\nsimple form G D \u0012I \u2212 .dI 2 sin 4\u0012\/=.8b\/ \u2212 eI 2=.8b\/ if corrections involving \" and a are\nneglected; the complete form is slightly more complicated.)\nThe fine-print in the derivation for m D 4 is that two orbits pretend to bifurcate also as\nwe send a! b. We identify now these orbits and show that for codimension two they are\nactually ghosts (complex solutions of the fixed-point equations) at a finite distance to the\ncentre. For simplicity we set e D 0; this does not affect the general line of reasoning. The\nsatellites that concern us solve the fixed-point equation\n@ QH.4\/\n@\u001e\nD \u22124I 2[a \u2212 b C .c \u2212 d\/I ] sin 4\u001e D 0 (A6)\nby I D I .0\/ \u0011 .b \u2212 a\/=.c \u2212 d\/.

The symmetry is broken if e 6D 0.) For reasons similar to those\nput forward for m D 1; 2, two parameters have to be controlled in order achieve I .0\/ D 0,\ni.e. a D b. For the given parameter combination there is no \u001e dependence in the second\norder of I . However, actually there are two independent terms involving \u001e, namely cos 4\u001e\nand sin 4\u001e\u2014one of them had been eliminated by a diagonalization that is again sensible\nonly if the other has a nonvanishing coefficient. We already used two parameters, then, such\nthat we must assume \" and a \u0019 b to be finite. This gives j cos 4\u001ej \u0018 .a \u2212 b\/\u22122 \u001d 1 and\ncos\u001e \u0018 .a \u2212 b\/\u22121=2 D O.I .0\/\u22121=2\/, and the Cartesian coordinates (6) indeed remain finite.\nAs announced this shows that the orbits that appeared to bifurcate are complex solutions\n(with real p and imaginary q) of the fixed-point equations and stay away from the centre.\nA.4. Codimension of the m D 3 scenario\nWe wish to point out here that the bifurcation scenario a D \" D 0 for m D 3 is actually\nof codimension three. The reasoning is similar to considerations for m D 1; 2; 4 in the\npreceding paragraphs. We argue that actually two external parameters have to be controlled\nin order to achieve a D 0. This eliminates simultaneously all \u001e-dependent terms of order\nI 3=2, of which two exist, I 3=2 sin 3\u001e and I 3=2 cos 3\u001e. The bifurcation sequence in the\nunfolding has nevertheless the qualitative features of the codimension-two cases with m 6D 3.\nAppendix B. Derivation of normal forms for phase and amplitude\nIn section 4.2 we presented normal forms for the phase function 8 and the amplitude\nfunction 9. In section 4.3 we demonstrated that these normal forms lead to uniform\ncollective contributions of bifurcating orbits when inserted into the integral (27); the\ncoefficients can be determined unambiguously from the classical properties of the orbits.\nHere we turn to the derivation of the normal forms.\nB.1. From Hamiltonian normal forms to the phase function\nFirst we have to establish the connection between the Hamiltonian normal forms and the\nphase function8, since the expansion in canonical polar coordinates I , \u001e is originally carried\nout in the Hamiltonian. To each normal form of the Hamiltonian there is a corresponding\nPeriodic orbits near bifurcations of codimension two 4191\nexpression for the generating function which carries over to the phase function 8. This\nfunction has as many stationary points as the Hamiltonian. The simplest functional form\nthat can be achieved is identical to the normal form of the Hamiltonian, but with altered\ncoefficients. (Observe, however, that although this form of 8.q 0; p\/, when expressed by\ncanonical polar coordinates, obeys again rotational symmetries Cm, this is no longer the case\nfor the map generated by it.) To illustrate this identification we note that the normal forms\neffectively describe the integrable dynamics of an autonomous system with one degree of\nfreedom. In action-angle variables J ,  the evolution over a time interval of duration one\nis generated by\nOS.J;  0\/ D S0 C . 0 C 2\u0019n\/J \u2212H.J \/ (B1)\nsuch that J D J 0 and  D  0 \u2212 !.J \/ mod 2\u0019 with the torus frequency !.J \/ D dH=dJ .\nThe action variable J is quantized since the angle  is only given modulo 2\u0019 ; this gives\nrise to branches of the generating function that are here enumerated by n. We circumvent\nthis obstacle by considering the map in Cartesian coordinates, generated by OS.q 0; p\/, and\nappealing to the canonical invariance of the leading-order term in the h\u00af-expansion that\nwe are looking for. (This does not affect the option to shift finally to canonical polar\ncoordinates in the integral expression (27).) The transformation to these variables yields\nnew coefficients: for instance, while the second derivatives of H around a stable orbit\ninvolve the bare stability angle !, we are led for the generating function to the relation (25)\nwith trM D 2 cos!. The coefficients in 8 are therefore related, but not identical to those\nin the normal forms of the Hamiltonian, although we will not reflect this in a change of\nnotation; however, minus signs will be introduced following a convention that is motivated\nby equation (B1).\nB.2. Reduction of extended phase functions to normal form\nFollowing [10\u201312] on codimension-one bifurcations, we introduce higher-order terms into\nthe phase function 8 in order to equip ourselves with enough coefficients such that classical\nproperties of the orbits become independent. These terms are then eliminated in the region\nof almost stationary phase by noncanonical transformations. Such transformations can also\nbe used to get rid of the additional nonbifurcating orbits described by the original normal\nform. The Jacobian of the transformation enters the amplitude function 9, which can be\nsimplified further by partial integrations.\nThe remainder in the phase and amplitude consists of higher orders in I as well as\na, \". We will invoke Vieta\u2019s relations to regard the coefficients as certain orders of the\ntypical distance of the satellites to the central orbit. The coefficient \" is usually the product\nof such distances, while a is a sum. We will also use that the original normal forms\nentail 9 D constant plus corrections of the form q 0lpk . In most cases the precise form\nof coefficients in the transformations is of no particular interest and therefore only given\nwhere this illustrates the method; the expressions are easily obtained, for instance, with the\nassistance of symbolic mathematical programmes. Only the feasibility of reduction counts.\nFinally all coefficients in 9 and 8 are not to be determined from explicit expansions of\nHamiltonians or generating functions but rather from the actions and stability properties of\nthe orbits as explained in section 4.3.\nB.3. Reduction for m D 1\nFor m D 1; 2; 3 all the periodic points described by the original normal forms are indeed\ninvolved in the bifurcation. For m D 1 there is at least one real orbit which we place into\n4192 H Schomerus\nthe origin by a shift of q 0. This results in the normal form 8.1\/. The three coefficients \",\na, and b as well as the value S0 D 8.1\/.0; 0\/ are fixed by the three actions of the orbits\nand one of the stability factors. From the normal form follows 9 D 1; the other stability\nfactors are therefore not yet independent. At a little distance to the bifurcation, however,\nhigher-order terms in the Hamiltonian or the phase function act as a perturbation, and the\nimplied relations between the classical quantities of the orbits are no longer valid. For\nm D 1 we consider terms of type cq 05 and dq 06, i.e.\n8.q 0; p\/ D S0 \u2212 \"q 02 \u2212 aq 03 \u2212 bq 04 \u2212 cq 05 \u2212 dq 06 \u2212 \u001b2 p\n2: (B2)\nHigher-order terms involving p effectively do not alter the final expression and can be\ndiscarded. In the region of almost stationary phase the higher-order terms act as a\nperturbation and can be eliminated by substituting q 0 D Q C AQ2 C BQ3 with suitably\nchosen coefficients. (The coefficients can be found in general, but are of no interest here.\nSimple expressions are obtained if we regard \" D O.q\u00032\/ and a D O.q\u0003\/, where q\u0003 is the\ntypical distance between the orbits. These orders are justified by Vieta\u2019s relations for the\nstationary-point equation\nd8\ndq 0\n\f\f\f\f\npD0\nD \u2212q 0.2\" C 3aq 0 C 4bq 02\/CO.q 04\/ D 0: (B3)\nTo the required order, we find then A D \u2212c=.4b\/ \u2212 27ac2=.128b3\/ C 3ad=.16b2\/ and\nB D 7c2=.32b2\/\u2212 d=.4b\/.)\nThe Jacobian of the transformation involves, in general, dq 0 D dQ.1C 2AQC 3BQ2\/\nand gives the normal form 9.1\/.q 0; p\/ announced above. The two additional coefficients\nare determined by the remaining stability factors trM of the satellites. Corrections to 8 of\neven higher order would carry over to higher-order terms in 9. They involve additional\ncoefficients and on first sight allow for ambiguities, but can be eliminated by successive\npartial integrations. The term of highest order is written as\nQl \u0018 Ql\u22123 d8\n.1\/\ndQ\nC terms of order l \u2212 1, l \u2212 2: (B4)\nThe partial integration of the first term gives an order h\u00afQl\u22124 and a boundary contribution\nthat vanishes for l > 4. In the course of this procedure the constant 1 and the coefficients\n\u000b and \f in 9.1\/ acquire next-to-leading order corrections in h\u00af that can be discarded and\nreflect canonically noninvariant properties of the orbits.\nB.4. Reduction for m D 2\nFor m D 2 the higher-order terms have to obey the reflection symmetry q 0 ! \u2212q 0 and are\non the q 0-axis of the form dq 08 and eq 010. They are eliminated by q2 D Q2 CAQ4 CBQ6.\nThe Jacobian involves only even orders of Q. Terms of order l > 6 can be eliminated in\n9 by writing\nQl \u0018 Ql\u22125 d8\n.2\/\ndQ\nC terms of order l \u2212 2, l \u2212 4 (B5)\nand performing a partial integration of the first term that yields a term \u0018 h\u00afQl\u22126. This\nreduces the amplitude function to its normal form 9.2\/.\nPeriodic orbits near bifurcations of codimension two 4193\nB.5. Reduction for m D 3\nWe use the case m D 3 to illustrate in detail the reduction procedure in canonical polar\ncoordinates and consider the extended normal form\n8.q 0; p\/ D S0 \u2212 \"I \u2212 aI 3=2 cos 3\u001e \u2212 bI 2 \u2212 cI 5=2 cos 3\u001e \u2212 dI 3 \u2212 eI 3 cos 6\u001e: (B6)\nWe can safely use \" D O.I \u0003\/ and a D O.I \u00031=2\/ as upper bounds in orders of the typical\ndistance I \u0003 of the satellites to the centre, which is in turn connected with the size of\nthe region of almost stationary phase. Note that this does not impose a restriction on\nthe relative order of these parameters as long as they are small enough. In order to be\nconsistent, however, we have to assume \"=a D O.I \u00031=2\/, since otherwise the order I 5=2\nwould be dominant over I 3=2, in contradiction to our initial assumption that higher orders\nin I can be treated as a perturbation.

Reduction for m D 4\nOnly three of the six satellites described by QH.4\/ (A5) are involved in the codimension-two\nbifurcation with m D 4. The normal form 8.4\/ has been given a deeper foundation in the\ndiscussion of the corresponding Hamiltonian H.4\/ in section A.3, where some (canonical)\ntransformations have been performed. The outer satellite on the lines cos 4 D \u22121 is\nshifted to infinity and is infinitely unstable, j trMj D 1. The two satellites at radial\ndistance I D .b\u2212 a\/=c have cos 4 \u0019 \u22125. They are consequently ghosts with real actions\nand do not contribute in the stationary-phase limit (for a deeper foundation see section 5);\nmoreover, they are quite far away from the bifurcating orbits. We assume for that reason\nthat their influence is negligible. This leaves us with a normal form that is again completely\ndetermined by the actions and one stability factor. We assume that the three non-bifurcating\nsatellites remain negligible even under the influence of higher-order terms.\nThe reduction of the extended normal form is then carried out in the same way as for\nm D 3. The corresponding amplitude normal form 9.4\/ is irreducible under further partial\nintegrations, but has one more coefficient than needed to account for independent stability\nfactors of the satellites. In analogy to the situation to be discussed for m > 5 we can\nuse this coefficient to yield 9 D 0 at the position of the unwanted ghosts in favour of an\nadditional suppression.\nPeriodic orbits near bifurcations of codimension two 4195\nB.7. Reduction for m D 5; 6\nFor m D 5 there are three bifurcating satellites but not enough coefficients in the original\nnormal form to account for independent actions. Observe that a scaling transformation\nI D AJ does not affect the values of the phase function at the stationary points. Only the\ntwo combinations \"2=a and \"5=2=b enter these values which have to match the three actions\nof the satellites. (The coefficients are determined uniquely if one takes the stability factors\ninto consideration.) Independent actions are admissible after allowing for higher-order terms\nwhich are once more removed by a transformation in order to yield no spurious additional\nstationary points. The next-order term, for instance, conveniently expressed as C5bc=2I 3,\ncan be eliminated by a transformation\nI D J C cJ 3=2 cos 5 (B16)\n\u001e D  \u2212 c\n2\nJ 1=2 sin 5 (B17)\nwhich is similar to the one for m D 3, but now the order J 1=2 survives in the Jacobian,\n9 D 1\u2212 cJ 1=2 cos 5 CO.J \/: (B18)\nThe transformation gives rise to the term \u2212\"cJ 3=2 cos 5 in 8 and provides us with the\nadditional coefficient c. (The coefficient \"c in 8 can be treated as O.J \u00033=2\/, where J \u0003\ngives the order of the distance of the satellites to the central orbit. This order is related to\nthe coefficients \" and a by application of Vieta\u2019s relations to the stationary-point equation\n@8=@I D 0.) The next-order corrections to 8 give even one coefficient more in 9 than\nnecessary for independent stability factors of the bifurcating orbits. There is, however,\nan extra pair of satellites at I D I .0\/ \u0011 \u2212\"c=b that even approaches the centre as\n\" ! 0. The angular coordinate, however, obtains a large imaginary part since it obeys\n.I .0\/\/1=2c cos 5\u001e D 1, where a term of order a has been dropped. Indeed this yields\nin leading order (B18) a vanishing 9 and encourages us to use the extra coefficient to\naccomplish suppression of the unwanted ghosts.\nA similar situation is encountered for m D 6: only three independent actions of four\nbifurcating satellites can be modelled with the original normal form, but higher-order terms\ngive rise to corrections that lead to the given normal forms of phase and amplitude. An\nextra coefficient is again present to suppress the ghost pair at I D \u2212\"d=c, and the Jacobian\nof the transformation turns out to be once more in favour of such a strategy.\nB.8. Reduction for m > 7\nEnough coefficients for the actions are present in the original normal form of 8 for m > 7,\nbut the expression yields more stationary points than desired. The \u001e-dependent terms of\nhighest order in I can be eliminated in favour of terms of lower order by successive\nsubstitutions I D J C AJ l cosm\u001e. This procedure can be carried out in parallel to\nsubstitutions I D J C BJ l that aim at the elimination of \u001e-independent terms. The\ncoefficients of the remaining terms reflect the values at the stationary point up to the order\nthat yields them as independent from each other and allows also for independent stability\nfactors through the expression for 9. In the derivation one encounters again a Jacobian that\nvanishes at the location of the unwanted ghost pair at I D \u2212\"d=c. We should note that the\ncoefficient c is here of order a, or, equivalently, \"1=2.\nReferences\n[1] Gutzwiller M C 1971 J. Math.
