We present examples and statistical analysis of\nthe events with statistically significant correlation between\nthe cosmic noise absorption (CNA) and the signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR) of the VHF coherent echo intensity in the area\nmonitored simultaneously by an imaging riometer and two\noblique-sounding coherent VHF radars in Northern Scandi-\nnavia. By only considering the observations from the nar-\nrow riometer beams comparable (in terms of the intersection\nwith the ionosphere) with the VHF radar cells, we identify\n\u223c200 one-hour high correlation periods (HCPs) for 2 years\nnear the solar cycle maximum, 2000\u20132001. The HCP oc-\ncurrence is maximized in the afternoon (12:00\u201317:00 UT,\nMLT\u223c=UT+3), with the secondary peak near the midnight\n(21:00\u201302:00 UT). Relative to the VHF echo occurrence,\nHCPs occur more frequently from 11:00 to 20:00 UT. The\ndiurnal variation of HCP occurrence is similar to that of the\n1-h intervals with the lowest mean absorption A<0.25 dB.\nThe HCPs are observed more frequently during the winter\nmonths, which, combined with the fact that VHF echoes ob-\nserved during HCPs exhibit features typical for field-aligned\nE-region irregularities, makes their association with the po-\nlar mesospheric echoes (for which some positive CNA\/SNR\ncorrelation has been reported in the past) very unlikely. In-\nstead, we attribute the high positive CNA\/SNR correlation\nto the synchronous, to a first approximation, variation of the\nparticle fluxes for two different but close sets of energies.\nBy considering the dependence of the CNA\/SNR correla-\ntion coefficients for both VHF radars (CA1 and CA2) upon\nthe correlation between SNRs for two radars (C12), we show\nthat both coefficients, CA1 and CA2, and the agreement be-\ntween them decrease drastically with a C12 decrease, which\nwe interpreted through the progressively increasing role of\nthe spatial inhomogeneity of the processes leading to the en-\nhanced CNA and SNR. In this situation, a similarity between\nthe radio signal collection areas should become important,\nand we demonstrate that the HCP occurrence and mean cor-\nCorrespondence to: R. A.

Ionosphere (Auroral ionosphere; Particle pre-\ncipitation; Instruments and techniques)\n1 Introduction\nSince the introduction of relative ionospheric opacity meters\n(riometers) in the late 1950s, cosmic noise absorption (CNA)\nmeasurements have been routinely used for studies of the\nEarth\u2019s ionosphere as a proxy for energetic particle precip-\nitation at D-region altitudes (60\u201390 km), as well as at higher\nE- and F-region altitudes (see, for example, review papers by\nHargreaves, 1969; Stauning, 1996a,b).\nStudies have identified several types of absorption events\naccording to the time of observations, event duration, shape\nof absorption intensity variation with time, accompanying\nphenomena and associated mechanisms. Thus, both mid-\nnight and morning auroral absorption have been attributed to\nthe energetic (10\u2013100 keV) electrons injected into the region\nof closed field lines that either immediately precipitate in the\nmidnight sector or drift and precipitate further in the morn-\ning sector (Ansari, 1964). The same mechanism has been\napplied later to the daytime absorption (e.g. Nishino et al.,\n1999; Kavanagh et al., 2002).\nPre- and post-midnight auroral absorption have been found\nto exhibit some association with various optical auroral\nforms (see Hargreaves, 1969, and references therein), with\nthe correlation coefficient between optical intensity and\nCNA maximized in the midnight sector and decreasing with\ntime (Ansari, 1964).

The experimental setup in Northern Scandinavia showing\nthe central positions of IRIS beams at 90 km by black circles, pro-\njections of the 3-dB IRIS beams by contours filled with horizontal\nlines, STARE Finland radar cells near the IRIS FoV by dotted con-\ntours, and STARE Finland (grey) and Norway (black) radar cells\nclosest to the selected IRIS beams with digits nearby indicating the\nIRIS beam number.\ncorrelation has been reported between the CNA and Polar\nMesospheric Summer Echo (PMSE) intensity (Czechowsky\net al., 1989; Kirkwood et al., 1995; Klostermeyer, 1999;\nBarabash et al., 2002) as observed by VHF radars, al-\nthough statistically the correlation appears to be rather weak\n(Czechowsky et al., 1989; Bremer et al., 2000; Barabash\net al., 2002).\nIn this paper we attempt to advance our knowledge of the\nprocesses leading to the enhanced cosmic noise absorption\nby exploring the relationship between the riometer absorp-\ntion and backscatter power of auroral echoes detected by a\nVHF coherent radar. We consider the correlation between\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the VHF echoes and the CNA,\nand identify the periods of statistically significant high cor-\nrelation or high correlation periods (HCPs) with correlation\ncoefficients above 0.4 for 1-min resolution data. We also\nidentify the extended periods (over 3 h) of very high corre-\nlation (>0.8) and analyze statistically the HCP occurrence\nfor a 2-year observational period. By employing the data\nfrom several close but spatially separated locations (beams\nof an imaging riometer), we study the effects on the correla-\ntion arising from the differences in collecting areas between\nriometer and VHF radar.\n2 Experiment setup\nThe Lancaster University Imaging Riometer for Ionospheric\nStudies (IRIS) at Kilpisja\u00a8rvi, Finland (69.1\u25e6 N, 20.8\u25e6 E,\n\u223c66\u25e6 MLAT) has been providing the data on the CNA at\n38.2 MHz for 49 directions since September 1994 (Browne\net al., 1995). The riometer is analogous technically and\noperationally to other imaging riometers developed in the\nlate 1980s by the University of Maryland group (see Det-\nrick and Rosenberg, 1990, for details on imaging riometer\ntechniques). Figure 1 shows the central positions or foci of\nthe 49 beams and 3-dB contours at 90 km (the corner beam\ncontours are not shown) of the IRIS by black dots and areas\nfilled with horizontal lines, respectively.\nThe IRIS facility is conveniently located within the view-\ning areas of several other facilities in Northern Scandi-\nnavia, including the Scandinavian Twin Auroral Radar Ex-\nperiment (STARE) Norway and Finland VHF radars (\u223c140\nand \u223c144 MHz) located in Midtsandan, Norway (63.7\u25e6 N,\n10.73\u25e6 E) and Hankasalmi, Finland (62.3\u25e6 N, 26.6\u25e6 E), look-\ning roughly towards magnetic east and north, respectively.\nThe E-region echoes are monitored in 8 beams separated by\n3.6\u25e6 in azimuth (3.2\u25e6 half-power beam width) from 495 to\n1245 km at 15-km resolution. The data are integrated over\n20 s. We show in Fig. 1, by dotted lines, the STARE Finland\nradar cells closest to the IRIS field of view (FoV). In the stan-\ndard STARE mode (we only use such data), the single-pulse\ndata are used to determine the power of the echoes and the\ndouble-pulse data are used to determine the Doppler velocity\n(Greenwald et al., 1978; Nielsen, 1982). The STARE echoes\nthat had low power (<1 dB) were not considered.\nIn this study we only used the data from those IRIS beams\nwhose half-power collection areas are comparable to the\nSTARE radar cells (we thus did not consider either the cen-\ntral or the corner IRIS beams) and we show in Fig. 1 the\nradar cells closest to the selected IRIS beams for both Nor-\nway and Finland radars by black and grey areas, respectively,\nwith digits showing the IRIS beam number.\n3 Observations\nOne can easily notice from Fig. 1 that the degree of similar-\nity between the IRIS and STARE collection areas depends\nnot only on their size but also on the relative orientation\nand the distances between the points of maximum sensitiv-\nity\/foci. The latter are simply the centers of the radar cells\nfor STARE, while for IRIS these are the central positions of\nthe riometer beams shown by large black dots. For example,\nIRIS beam 41 is very similar to the closest STARE Norway\nradar cell both in terms of orientation and distance between\nthe foci. Both the STARE Finland focus and the centre of the\nintersection area of the STARE Norway and Finland radar\ncells are also close to the IRIS focus point. One can con-\nclude that a comparison between the CNA intensity and the\nSTARE backscatter powers would be more meaningful for\nIRIS beam 41 than, say, for beam 9, for which all three foci\nare somewhat apart from each other, so that the measure-\nments refer to different (although close) locations.\nIn the following two sections (Sects. 3.1 and 3.2) we per-\nform a statistical analysis of the CNA\/SNR correlation using\nR. A. Makarevitch and F. Honary: Correlation between cosmic noise absorption and VHF coherent echo intensity 1545\nthe data from the IRIS beam 41 and corresponding STARE\ncells for a 2-year period of high solar activity, from January\n2000 to December 2001, during which the STARE radars\nregularly observed the ionospheric echoes. Our aim is to\nexplore diurnal and seasonal (if any) variations of the peri-\nods with statistically significant correlation. In this study we\nused the data that have been post-integrated with a period of\n1 min. This has been done simply to reduce the database size\nand computation time. It was found that the use of 20-s res-\nolution data does not change the results of analysis in any\nsignificant way, with exception of slightly lower (by \u223c10%)\nresulting correlation coefficients.\nFor each 1-h period in 2000\u20132001, the linear Pearson cor-\nrelation coefficients were computed between the IRIS ab-\nsorption A in dB and backscatter powers (SNRs, also in dB)\nrecorded by the STARE Norway and Finland radars (Cna and\nCf a , respectively), as well as the correlation between the\nSTARE Norway and Finland powers (Cnf ). The correlation\ncoefficients were entered into the database only if all three\nparameters had finite values (data were available) for at least\n60% of the time within a given 1-h period.\nFigure 2 shows two examples of events with very high\ncorrelation (Cna>0.8 for over three hours) for (a) 12 and\n(b) 14 February 2000. The CNA intensity A is shown by\nthe red line, while the STARE Norway (Finland) backscat-\nter power variation is shown by the blue (green) line. The\ncorrelation levels Cna and Cf a for each 1-h period of con-\ntinuous (60% or more) observations are shown by the blue\nand green horizontal lines, respectively, with the correlation\nvalues shown by digits above the lines and by heights from\nthe bottom of each panel (100%-correlation period would be\nat the top; negative correlation periods are of the same height\nas the positive ones). Also shown in Fig. 2, by the dotted hor-\nizontal line, are the 0.4 correlation levels, comfortably above\n99% confidence levels for both 60- and 36-point (60%*60)\ntime series (0.27 and 0.35).\nOne can notice that during the first event (a) the correlation\nis high (Cna, Cf a>0.4) for 6 h (11:00\u201317:00 UT) and it is\nvery high (Cf a>0.67, Cna>0.84) for 3 h (14:00\u201317:00 UT).\nA similar pattern is observed for the second event (b), ex-\ncept that the very high correlation period is observed ear-\nlier (12:00\u201315:00 UT). Interestingly, the correlation with the\nNorway power appears to be generally greater. This can be\nseen not only from the correlation coefficients themselves but\nalso from the simple comparison of the line plots, thus at\n\u223c12:30 UT on 14 February 2000 the Norway SNR peaks al-\nmost simultaneously with the CNA, while Finland SNR vari-\nation only shows a broad maximum around this time.\n3.1 High correlation periods occurrence\nThe correlation coefficients computed, as described above,\nare used in this section to investigate the diurnal and sea-\nsonal dependencies of the high correlation period (HCP) oc-\ncurrence.

Both\nSTARE echo occurrences are comparable in these two sec-\ntors, whereas the HCP occurrence is at least 2 times higher\nin the afternoon (15% versus 6%).\nA similar feature is also present if one considers not only\nthe total number of echoes versus the time of the observa-\ntions, as in Fig. 3, but also the total number of 1-h periods\nwith at least 60% echo occurrence, which is perhaps a more\nproper measure for the STARE echo occurrence, since this\nwas the criterium for the correlation coefficient calculations.\nFigure 4 shows the 60% STARE echo occurrence (black his-\ntogram) and the relative HCP occurrence (grey thick line).\nTo obtain the latter we divided the HCP occurrence (white\nline in Fig. 4) if the latter was above a critical value of 2,\nby the STARE occurrence and normalized it, so that the total\narea under the grey line is equal to 100%. The STARE echo\ndistribution in Fig. 4 is very similar to that in Fig. 3, with the\nmaximum at 14:00\u201316:00 UT. The relative HCP occurrence\nis maximized somewhat earlier, at 12:00\u201315:00 UT. One can\nconclude that the maximum of the HCP occurrence in the\nafternoon sector is not purely due to the bias in the STARE\necho occurrence but rather suggestive of a general pattern.\nGiven this pattern for the diurnal variation of HCP occur-\nrence it is instructive to compare it with the diurnal varia-\ntion for various absorption intensity levels, in attempt to re-\nveal the typical absorption intensities during the periods with\n \n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24\nUT\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n200\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\nO\ncc\nur\nre\nnc\ne, \n%\nNF\nFig. 4.

The absorption levels shown in\nFig. 5 are computed for 1-h average absorption. The white\nlines in Fig. 5 are the HCP occurrence and the black lines are\nthe relative occurrence of the 0.25<A<0.50 dB level with re-\nspect to the one of 0.00<A<0.25 dB. The latter was plotted\nin panel (b) only when the HCP occurrence exceeded 10%.\nLet us first discuss the features of panel (a). Only the first\ndistribution (0.00<A<0.25) exhibits similar variation to the\nHCP occurrence, all other diurnal variations are rather an-\nticorrelated with that of the HCPs. The relative occurrence\nbetween the two absorption levels also shows some anticor-\nrelation, although its minimum is not exactly simultaneous\nwith the maximum of the HCP variation but shifted by 1\u2013\n2 h. Overall, absorption between 0.00\u20130.25 dB is observed\nmore frequently in the afternoon, both in absolute terms and\nrelative to the absorption between 0.25\u20130.50 dB. During 111\ndays with HCPs, panel (b), the absorption is predominantly\nbetween 0.00\u20130.25 dB with some contribution from the 0.25\u2013\n0.50 dB level. The trends are similar to the HCP occurrence.\nThe relative occurrence of 0.25\u20130.50 dB level is, however,\nsomewhat greater than that for all 731 days.\nIn summary, the absorption was predominantly in the\nrange 0.00\u20130.25 dB in the afternoon when the HCP occur-\nrence was at maximum, which suggests that HCPs are asso-\nciated with the low absorption intensities.\n3.2 Scatter plots of CNA\/SNR correlation\nThe question of what are the typical conditions for the HCPs\nto be observed is a fundamental one, and in this section we\naddress the issue by plotting the correlation coefficients Cna\nR.

Interest-\ningly, when the discrepancies are large, for example, when\nCna and Cf a are of the opposite sign, Cnf is predominantly\nnegative (diamonds). The points also tend to be closer to the\nideal coincidence line when Cnf is larger. This point is made\nclearer in panel (b) which shows only the points with Cnf>\n0.8. The mean correlation coefficients (Cna, Cf a) shown by\nthe large black dot in panels (a) and (b) are also greater in\npanel (b) and so is the percentage of HCPs, Nhc. The latter\nare calculated by dividing the number of HCPs (points in the\nright top corners nhc, Cna, Cf a>0.4) by the total number of\npoints nall . The points with greater Cnf are associated with\ngreater Cna, Cf a (red points concentrate in the top-right cor-\nner).

It is also noteworthy that Figs. 6a\nand b do not have any noticeable bias towards either of the\nSTARE radars; the scatter plots are fairly symmetric with re-\nspect to the ideal coincidence line and the mean correlation\ncoefficient is only slightly larger for Norway radar. The dis-\ncrepancy is larger for allCnf , Fig. 6a (meanCna=0.35 versus\nmean Cf a=0.23), but this is almost entirely due to the points\nwith negative Cnf and Cf a and positive Cna (cluster of di-\namonds in the bottom-right quadrant), so that for Cnf>0.8\n(Fig. 6b) the discrepancy becomes smaller (0.43 versus 0.40).\nPanels (c) and (d) present the same data as panels (a) and\n(b), except that colour-coding has been done in absorption\nintensity. There is no clear trend in the absorption in pan-\nels (c); all points are rather mixed. The points with larger\nabsorption tend to appear farther from the ideal coincidence\nline, so that in panel (d) the points near it predominantly have\nsmall absorption, with exception of the top-right corner.\n3.3 CNA\/SNR correlation and spatial effects\nIn the beginning of Sect. 3 we noted that the observations at\nthe IRIS beam 41 had a better opportunity to show high cor-\nrelation than the ones at beam 9, simply because of the spatial\n1548 R.

The IRIS beam numbers\nare shown by digits near each point.\ndifferences in observational areas. In this section we explore\nthe spatial effects by employing the data from all considered\nIRIS beams and corresponding STARE radar cells. To char-\nacterize the differences in observational areas we introduce\na simple quantitative measure, namely for each of the eight\nIRIS beams we consider the total distance between the points\nof maximum sensitivity, that is the perimeter of the triangle\nformed by the centers of the two radar cells and by the cen-\ntral position of the IRIS beam. This parameter describes the\ndegree of similarity between the observational areas, both in\nterms of the orientation and foci closeness; the closer it is to\nzero, the larger the similarity. Figure 7 shows the (a) occur-\nrence of HCPs and (b) the mean correlation coefficient Cna\nas functions of the total distance. The occurrence Nhc and\nmean coefficient Cna are computed as described in the pre-\nvious section. The IRIS beam number is indicated near each\npoint.\nAs one would expect, point 41 is the highest in both pan-\nels having the largest HCP occurrence and mean correlation,\nwhile point 9 is the lowest. Overall, there is a decrease in\nboth HCP occurrence and mean correlation with total dis-\ntance increase, which indicates that the spatial effects con-\ntribute strongly to the amount of correlation observed.\nOne can argue that Fig. 7 is biased towards IRIS beam\n41, since the event selection was based entirely on the data\nfrom this direction. We therefore repeated the HCP occur-\nrence calculations seven more times (by taking as the \u201cbase\u201d\ndirection IRIS beams 4, 28, 46, 37, 13, 22, and 9, selecting\ncorresponding event databases, and computing Nhc for each\nof these directions) and found only marginal differences as\ncompared to the results presented in Fig. 7. Thus, the HCP\nrespective occurrences were 36, 27, 29, 26, 25, 28, 26, and\n21%, where the first value refers to the HCP occurrence at\nbeam 41 from Fig. 7a.\n4 Discussion\nThe observations of high positive correlation between the ri-\nometer absorption and the VHF echo power reported in this\npaper are the first observations of this kind, which neces-\nsitates the consideration of this phenomenon in the context\nof other auroral phenomena, as outlined in Sect. 1. In this\nsense of special importance is the fact that a vast majority\nof high correlation events occur in the afternoon sector, be-\ntween 12:00 and 19:00 UT, Fig. 3. On a case-by-case basis,\nthe events of very long duration and high correlation were\nalso observed between 12:00 and 17:00 UT, Fig. 2. The\nabsorption events in this time sector are significantly less\nunderstood than other absorption types such as, for exam-\nple, midnight and morning absorption, both linked to the\nsubstorm activity on the nightside (Stauning, 1996a). It is,\ntherefore, not surprising that the high correlation was ob-\nserved away from the midnight meridian, in sharp contrast\nwith the results for the correlation with the optical intensity\n(Ansari, 1964) and magnetic disturbance (Brown and Camp-\nbell, 1962), since the physical mechanism responsible for the\nenhanced CNA levels could easily be different for the after-\nnoon events.\nIt is well accepted that the bulk of the absorption events\nis associated with the enhanced ionization (ambient elec-\ntron density Ne) at D-\/lower E-region altitudes caused by the\nprecipitating electrons (Hargreaves, 1969; Stauning, 1996a).\nSome of the absorption events observed with riometers in\nthe polar cap, however, have been also associated in the past\nwith an increase in the E-region collision frequencies caused\nby electron heating (Stauning, 1984; Stauning and Olesen,\n1989) and with an increase in F-region densities (Rosenberg\net al., 1993; Wang et al., 1994).\nThe power of coherent echoes is, on the other hand, a com-\nplex function, depending upon the electric field intensity E\n(through the fractional electron density fluctuation amplitude\n\u03b4Ne\/Ne), ambient electron density Ne, angle between the di-\nrection of propagation k and that of the magnetic field B (as-\npect angle \u03b1), angle between k and the plasma drift vector\nVd (flow angle \u03b8 ), and distance from the radar site to the\nbackscatter region r (e.g. Haldoupis, 1989). In this study, we\nconsider observations at essentially one observational point\n(one beam of IRIS and closest STARE cells), which greatly\nsimplifies the problem, as both r and \u03b1 can be assumed to\nbe constants with refraction negligible at 140 MHz. Even\nthough r and \u03b1 are different for the two radars, this is not\nan issue since we consider the correlations. The flow an-\ngle effects, in principle, could be present in the SNR data,\nas the echo power is known to decrease with the deviation\nfrom the plasma drift direction (Andre\u00b4, 1983). We are not in\na position to estimate the flow angles and to study these ef-\nfects rigourously, since this would require the information on\nthe electric field at the locations of the selected IRIS beams\nduring the entire period under investigation. Given that the\ninterpretation of the STARE velocity data is far from straight-\nforward, in particular, during the intervals of strong plasma\nflow (Uspensky et al., 2004), we focused on the echo power\ndata. First of all, we were interested in the fact of a high\nCNA\/SNR correlation itself and were confident that the us-\nage of the relatively short 1-h intervals minimized the flow\nangle effects in the correlation analysis. In addition, the\nR. A. Makarevitch and F. Honary: Correlation between cosmic noise absorption and VHF coherent echo intensity 1549\nmagnetic perturbation data from the International Monitor\nfor Auroral Geomagnetic Effects (IMAGE) and Sub-Auroral\nMagnetometer Network (SAMNET) fluxgate magnetometers\nfor individual events showed that the electrojet flow was rel-\natively stable in terms of direction. We think, therefore, that\nthe most important parameters in the context of this study are\nthe electric field intensity E and the electron density Ne. The\nrelative contribution of E and Ne to the power of coherent\nechoes is still not well understood though, with some studies\nshowing a strong electric field control (e.g. Haldoupis et al.,\n1984) and others suggesting that power is proportional to N2e\n(Uspensky et al., 1983; Starkov et al., 1983; Haldoupis et al.,\n1990).\nThe combination of high electric fields and electron densi-\nties thus may be the reason for the enhancements in both au-\nroral absorption and VHF echo power, which can explain our\nobservations of high correlation. There is one drawback in\nthis interpretation though, namely that the principal absorp-\ntion layer is somewhat lower than the typical altitude range\nwhere VHF radars detect irregularities (85\u201395 km for absorp-\ntion versus 105\u2013110 km for irregularities). This is not a prob-\nlem if the densities vary to a large degree synchronously for\nthe altitude range in question (85\u2013110 km), which could be\nthe case if the spectra of the precipitating electrons are far\nfrom being monoenergetic. The wealth of existing obser-\nvational evidence on the correlation between optical inten-\nsity and CNA seems to support this hypothesis, since optical\nmeasurements typically refer to higher altitudes than those of\nabsorption (e.g. Holt and Omholt, 1962; Ansari, 1964).\nTo check whether the electrons precipitating at two\nset of heights (around 90 and 110 km) belong to the\nsame population, one would need to compare the elec-\ntron flux measurements for two corresponding energy\nranges. The empirical formula for the effective altitude of\nthe energy deposition derived by del Pozo et al. (1997),\n\u03b5(H)=4\u00d7105exp(\u22120.101H), gives electron energies of 45\nand 6 keV, respectively. Unfortunately, the electron flux mea-\nsurements in both energy ranges are difficult to obtain; the\ninstruments on board of the geostationary satellites, such as\nLos Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) satellites, mea-\nsure the fluxes of the electrons in the inner magnetosphere\nwith \u03b5>50 keV, whereas ionospheric satellites, such as De-\nfense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP), can provide\nthe fluxes of precipitating electrons with \u03b5<32 keV. The for-\nmer give temporal variation at several points in the region\nof closed field lines (6.6 RE , where RE is the Earth\u2019s radius)\nwhile the latter provide spatial variation along several satel-\nlite paths (Sun-synchronous orbits at\u223c830-km altitude). The\ntwo lowest electron energy channels for a Synchronous Or-\nbit Particle Analyzer (SOPA) instrument (Belian et al., 1992)\non board of the presently operational LANL satellites are\n50\u201375 and 75\u2013105 keV. Although these energies are some-\nwhat greater than those of interest, one can check whether\nthe electron fluxes were synchronous, and in Fig. 8 we show\nthe electron flux measurements from these two energy chan-\nnels from the LANL satellite 1994\u2013084, the satellite closest\nin magnetic local time (MLT\u223cUT+10) to the IRIS viewing\n \n         \n \n \n101\n102\n103\n104\n105\n106\n107\nD\niff\n.

The periods of very high CNA\/SNR correlation\nfrom Fig. 2 (highlighted in Fig. 8) correspond to the intervals\nduring which the correlation between fluxes was very high\n(above 0.9). One can conclude that the electron flux data\nfrom the LANL satellite is consistent with the idea that the\nCNA\/SNR correlation is due to the electrons whose fluxes\nvary synchronously, to a first approximation, within a range\nof altitudes (90\u2013110 km).\nAnother possibility is that the CNA\/SNR correlation is as-\nsociated with the electrons precipitating at essentially the\nsame altitude range, since the division between the typical\naltitudes for CNA and SNR measurements is by no means\nwell defined. The thickness of the principal absorption layer\n(vertical distance between points where absorption is half\nthat at the peak) can be as high as 15\u201320 km (e.g. Jespersen\net al., 1968) and the absorption layer peak can be well above\n90 km (e.g. Terkildsen et al., 2004). The VHF backscatter\nsignal, on the other hand, can come from the wide range of\nheights with the altitude range which contributes the most\nto the backscatter power that is dependent upon the back-\nground density Ne(h) and fractional density fluctuation am-\nplitude (\u03b4Ne\/Ne)(h) profiles, as described recently by Us-\npensky et al. (2003).\n1550 R. A. Makarevitch and F. Honary: Correlation between cosmic noise absorption and VHF coherent echo intensity\nOne particular issue needs to be discussed in this context,\nnamely the nature of VHF echoes observed during the HCPs\nor, more specifically, whether these echoes were in fact polar\nmesospheric echoes, since in the past a positive CNA\/SNR\ncorrelation has been reported for PMSE observations (e.g.\nCzechowsky et al., 1989; Kirkwood et al., 1995; Barabash\net al., 2002). One should bear in mind, however, that\nthe vast majority of the PMSE observations have been per-\nformed with vertical incidence VHF radars at frequencies\nnear 50 MHz, while our measurements were carried out\nwith an oblique-sounding 144-MHz radar, sensitive to field-\naligned irregularities in the E region. For a similar experi-\nment geometry, the short-duration (<20 min) PMSE echoes\ndetected by the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (Su-\nperDARN) Syowa East radar, at very short ranges (180\u2013\n315 km), have been reported recently by Hosokawa et al.\n(2004). In our observations the ranges were much larger\n(>700 km) and the VHF backscatter was typically observed\nas wide (\u223c400 km) and relatively stable (1\u20132 h) bands of\nechoes; these features are typical for the E-region echoes as\nopposed to the polar mesospheric echoes.\nThe results on the diurnal\/seasonal variation presented in\nthis study also disagree with the PMSE hypothesis. The\nHCP occurrence was clearly maximized in the winter, while\nPMSEs are observed from May to August in the North-\nern Hemisphere (Bremer et al., 2003). Mesospheric echoes\nare observed also in the winter but these echoes are signif-\nicantly less frequent and are typically associated with the\nenhanced particle precipitation (Czechowsky et al., 1989).\nOur result on the HCP diurnal variation differs from that of\nBarabash et al. (2002), who reported a significant correla-\ntion between the square of CNA and PMSE intensities in the\n20:00\u201306:00 UT sector. We conclude, therefore, that VHF\nechoes in our observations are unlikely to originate from the\nD-region.\nDiurnal variation of HCP was similar to that of the low-\nest absorption level (0.0\u20130.25 dB) and different from other\nhigher levels of absorption, Fig. 5a. For days with at least\none HCP, the CNA at the highest levels (>0.5 dB) was virtu-\nally negligible, Fig. 5b. These features suggest that HCPs are\nassociated with the softer electrons that precipitate at higher\nE-region altitudes and produce relatively small (though still\nnoticeable) absorption enhancements. The lower the elec-\ntron energy, the larger the altitude of maximum ionization\nand hence the better the chances for high correlation with the\nbackscatter power. If so, one would expect the absorption\nintensity to decrease with a correlation coefficient increase.\nIndeed, for individual events this was often the case, for ex-\nample, in Fig. 2 the highest correlation was observed when\nCNA was at maximum. Statistically, however, the effect was\nnot obvious; in Figs. 6c and d points with larger absorption\nwere scattered in a seemingly random fashion. We believe\nthat the reason can be that, apart from the physical conditions\n(e.g. particle energy which stipulates the maximum ioniza-\ntion height) at a specific point of measurement, the amount\nof correlation is strongly controlled by the degree of spatial\nhomogeneity, as discussed below.\nThe question that we address is: How much of the cor-\nrelation is \u201clost\u201d due to the differences in observational ar-\neas, as very often riometer absorption and other parameters\nare compared at locations that are somewhat apart from each\nother? In this study we specifically looked at the problem\nby exploiting a unique opportunity stemming from the ex-\nperiment geometry in Northern Scandinavia, where riometer\nabsorption measurements with high spatial resolution can be\ncombined with the stereoscopic measurements by two VHF\nradars.\nWe first looked at the effects of the correlation between\necho powers measured by two radars which can be consid-\nered as a measure of spatial homogeneity\/inhomogeneity, as\nexplained below. The radars monitor slightly different lo-\ncations and, in addition, collect a backscatter signal from\nslightly different areas (radar cells), Fig. 1. In a situa-\ntion when the correlation Cnf is high, the effects arising\nfrom these differences are not significant because of the gen-\neral spatial homogeneity of processes associated with the\nbackscatter signal formation. Thus, if the generation of irreg-\nularities is spatially homogeneous in the common area that\nincludes both Norway and Finland radar cells, one can ex-\npect that the echo power would be the same for both radars\nas well, and so would the correlation between some other\nparameter (CNA in our case) and SNR, in agreement with\nFig. 6b. For events with sufficiently high correlation coef-\nficients Cnf , the agreement between CNA\/SNR correlation\ncoefficients is greatly improved. The increases in the mean\ncorrelation coefficients, Cna and Cf a , and in the HCP per-\ncentage, Nhc, were also significant, Fig. 6. We hence con-\nclude that the CNA\/SNR correlation is dependent upon the\nspatial homogeneity of the processes associated with cosmic\nnoise absorption and backscatter power formation.\nThe data presented in Fig. 6, however, also indicate that\nthe percentage of the events with high correlation Cnf is\nrather low (yellow\/red dots in Fig. 6 are less frequent than\nblack\/blue\/green ones) and that very often it is negative, so\nthat more often than not the backscatter signal formation pro-\ncess is inhomogeneous. In this situation a similarity between\nthe collection areas becomes an important factor which can\nsignificantly affect the amount of CNA\/SNR correlation ob-\nserved. Indeed, Fig. 7 shows that this is exactly the case.\nBoth the HCP occurrence Nhc and the mean correlation Cna\nare reduced if the distances between the collection area foci\nare large, which we interpret as a decrease associated with\ndifferences in observational areas, combined with consider-\nable spatial inhomogeneity.\nIn our discussion of the factors responsible for the\nCNA\/SNR correlation we emphasized the importance of both\nelectric field intensity and ambient electron density but left\nunaddressed the issue of the dominant factor, since no direct\nmeasurements of these two parameters were available. The\nHCPs were predominantly observed in the afternoon sector\nin between 15 and 20 MLT, Fig. 3. Given the latitude of the\ncommon FoV (\u223c66\u25e6 MLAT), the observations in this sector\npredominantly refer to the eastward electrojet or to the earth-\nward flow region in the magnetospheric plasma sheet. In this\nR. A. Makarevitch and F. Honary: Correlation between cosmic noise absorption and VHF coherent echo intensity 1551\nregion, the electrons could be accelerated by the earthward\nconvection to sufficiently high energies to be detected by a\nriometer on the Earth\u2019s surface. If so, one can expect a cer-\ntain amount of correlation between riometer absorption and\nplasma drift velocity. Even though the derivation of the full\nplasma drift vector from the STARE Doppler velocity mea-\nsurements could be quite challenging, as demonstrated re-\ncently by Uspensky et al. (2003, 2004), one can still attempt\nto identify the effect sought in the Doppler velocity data.\nFigure 9 shows the results of the analysis analogous to that\nof Fig. 6, except that the points are colour-coded in corre-\nlation coefficient between the STARE Norway velocity and\nIRIS absorption, Cvna . One can recognize in Fig. 9a that, in-\ndeed, green and yellow points cluster in the top-right corner,\nmeaning that the periods with very high Cna> 0.8 also have\nhigh Cvna=0.6\u20130.8. The same is true for Fig. 9b (Cnf>0.8,\n\u201chomogenous case\u201d), which, together with the fact that in\nFigs. 6a and b and Figs. 9a and b points with high Cnf and\nCvna belong to two different (although intersecting) popula-\ntions, suggests that there are two different factors involved.\nOne can also see from Fig. 9 that not all HCPs are associ-\nated with a high correlation between CNA and the STARE\nvelocity, and that the amount of correlation for velocity is\nlower than that for power. One can conclude that for some\nHCP events, especially for ones that exhibit a very high cor-\nrelation, the electric field seems to dominate, which is con-\nsistent with the \u201celectron acceleration by a convection\u201d sce-\nnario proposed. More studies are needed, however, in or-\nder to make a more definite conclusion, in particular, those\nthat would utilize the in-situ observations of the magneto-\nspheric particle dynamics and ground-based measurements\nof the electron density.\n5 Summary\nThe analysis of the data collected during 2 years of operation\nin the common area between 7\u00d77-beam imaging riometer\nand two VHF coherent radars in Northern Scandinavia has\nrevealed \u223c200 one-hour intervals (during 111 days) of sta-\ntistically significant correlation between the cosmic noise ab-\nsorption and the signal-to-noise ratio. During several events\nthe CNA\/SNR correlation was particularly high (>0.8) for\nup to 3 h. The high correlation periods are observed predom-\ninantly in the afternoon sector and in the winter, with the\nsecondary peaks near midnight and in the summer. The di-\nurnal variation of HCPs is similar to that for events with 1-h\nmean absorption between 0.0 and 0.25 dB. Consideration of\nall 1-h intervals for 111 days with HCPs present, on the other\nhand, did not reveal any trend in the correlation coefficient\ndependence upon the absorption intensity. The CNA\/SNR\ncorrelation at a given observational point was found to de-\npend strongly upon the correlation between the coherent echo\nintensities measured by two VHF radars at the same loca-\ntion; both the CNA\/SNR correlation and agreement between\nthe CNA\/SNR correlation for the two radars was greatly re-\nduced when the correlation between the echo powers mea-\n \n-1.0 -0.5 0.0 0.5  \nCna\n-1.0\n-0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\nC\nfa\n \n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nCvna\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n    \n \na)\n \n \n-1.0 -0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0\nCna\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n   \n \nb)\nCnf > 0.8\nFig. 9. The same as Figs. 6a and b but colour-coded in correlation\ncoefficient between the STARE Norway velocity and IRIS absorp-\ntion, Cvna .\nsured by the two radars was smaller. From a comparison be-\ntween measurements at 8 observational directions, the HCP\noccurrence and mean correlation coefficients decrease as the\ntotal distance between points of maximum sensitivity (foci)\nincreases; both parameters are maximized for measurements\nat a direction for which the intersection of the riometer beam\nwith the ionosphere and radar cell are most comparable in\nterms of spatial coverage, orientation, and proximity between\nthe collection area foci.\n6 Conclusions\nThe events that exhibit a statistically significant correlation\nbetween the cosmic noise absorption and the VHF coherent\necho intensity, while being relatively rare, show consistent\nfeatures in their occurrence and correlation amount, from\nwhich the following conclusions can be drawn.\n1. There is evidence that high correlation periods are as-\nsociated with the electrons in the lower end of the en-\nergy spectrum precipitating at the E-region bottom side\nas opposed to more energetic particles with the maxi-\nmum ionization altitude in the D-region. The echoes de-\ntected by an oblique-sounding VHF radar during HCPs\nare unlikely to be mesospheric echoes. These echoes\nrepresent the scatter from the E-region field-aligned ir-\nregularities. Highly correlated variations in CNA and\nSNR are likely to be related to variation in ionization\nat two sets of heights caused by the precipitating elec-\ntrons at two close sets of energies whose fluxes are well\ncorrelated.\n2. The amount of correlation between riometer absorption\nand VHF echo power is strongly controlled by the de-\ngree of spatial homogeneity of the processes leading to\nenhanced CNA and SNR.\n3. For riometer beams and radar cells comparable in ar-\neas and shapes, the correlation is reduced as the areas\nbecome less overlapped (e.g. due to rotation) and as\nthe distance between points of maximum sensitivity in-\ncreases. It is therefore imperative to employ the CNA\n1552 R. A. Makarevitch and F.
