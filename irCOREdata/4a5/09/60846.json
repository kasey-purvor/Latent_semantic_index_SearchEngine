Introduction \n \n1.1 National Geological Surveys as knowledge-based organisations \n \nGeological survey organisations (GSOs), including the British Geological Survey \n(BGS), are established by most nations to provide a geoscience knowledge base that \nenables effective decision-making on mitigating the impacts of natural hazards and \nglobal environmental change, and on sustainable management of mineral, energy, \nwater and land resources. The knowledge base held by GSOs typically comprises a \nrange of data and information gathered by strategic geoscientific survey programmes, \nand may also include datasets obtained from (or held on behalf of) industry, \ngovernment and the academic community. The knowledge base may be held by a \nsingle, national GSO or, in some countries, may be distributed among several \nregionally-based agencies that, together with an \u2018umbrella\u2019 federal agency, \ncollectively provide the national GSO function. \n \nWhile GSOs usually have responsibility for managing the knowledge base and \nmaking it widely accessible, knowledge of the context, application and relevance of \nthat data and information extends way beyond the boundaries of the GSOs to a broad \ncommunity of users and stakeholders in education, research, industry and \ngovernment. The value of the knowledge base as a national asset is continually \nenhanced by exchange of knowledge between GSOs as data and information \nproviders and the stakeholder community as knowledge \u2018users and exploiters\u2019. \nConsultancy work, information and advisory services, outreach programmes and \ncollaborative research projects are highly effective methods of knowledge exchange, \nand are carried out by many GSOs as part of their remit. Such GSOs are therefore \n\u2018knowledge based\u2019 organisations that not only acquire and manage geo-environmental \ndata and information, but also understand its context, application, value and \nlimitations and can communicate these to users and stakeholders. Effective \nknowledge management - the creation and subsequent management of an environment \nthat encourages knowledge to be created, shared, learned, enhanced, organized and \nutilized for the benefit of the organisation and its customers - is therefore essential in \nGSOs to enable them to fulfil their national capability role. This paper presents a case \nstudy of how the BGS has implemented a workflow-based cyber-infrastructure to \nenhance its knowledge management and exchange capabilities, and places this \nprogress in the context of international efforts to develop collaborative cyber-\ninfrastructures and ontologies to discover, exchange and exploit geoscientific \nknowledge. \n \n2. Geoscience knowledge: definitions and requirements from the BGS \nperspective \n \nMany definitions of what is meant by data, information and knowledge have been \npublished within the last decade. The consensus has been summarised by Schreiber \n(2000) and more recently by Nickols (2000). In this paper, we refer to three types of \nknowledge: \n \n\uf0b7 Explicit - knowledge that has been recorded, communicated or articulated in \nsome tangible way; \n\uf0b7 Implicit \u2013 knowledge that is capable of being communicated or articulated, but \nis yet to be made explicit; \n\uf0b7 Tacit \u2013 knowledge that cannot be articulated, but is acquired and exchanged \nby experience-based learning.  \n \nFigure 1 expands on these definitions and provides some geoscientific examples (see \nalso Jones et al., 2004).  \n \nAs the United Kingdom\u2019s GSO, the BGS operates a \u2018mixed economy\u2019 business \nmodel, with approximately half of its income derived directly from government for a \n\u2018national capability\u2019 programme of strategic surveying, monitoring and information \nmanagement, and the other half from commissioned research contracts and from the \nsale or licensing of data and information. Collectively, these activities establish the \nBGS at the centre of the UK\u2019s national geoscience knowledge infrastructure (Figure \n2). \n \nIn 2000, the BGS implemented a new organisational strategy to enhance its \ncapabilities and national value as a knowledge-based organisation. This involved a \nmajor re-engineering of the organisational structure and human resource management \nfunctions in BGS to improve inter-disciplinary sharing of knowledge, and \ndevelopment of a workflow based cyber-infrastructure to enhance geoscience \nknowledge management and engender a more business-like approach to project \nmanagement. The cyber-infrastructure has not only focussed on identifying and \ncapturing implicit knowledge assets, but also elements of spatial knowledge, know-\nhow and experience that have conventionally been regarded as tacit, stored in the \ngeoscientists\u2019 minds, and difficult to articulate.   \n \nAs a brief checklist to guide the infrastructure design, BGS adopted the following \napproach to identify and capture the more implicit and tacit forms of its knowledge \nassets, along the lines described by Al-Hawamdeh et al. (2000):   \n \n\uf0b7 Recognise why the business model requires such a knowledge base; \n \n\uf0b7 Identify core functions along its geoscientific workflow and ensure that \ncollaborative knowledge gathering and interpretative procedures are in place; \n \n\uf0b7 Encourage innovation to flourish and new best practice to be captured in an \norganised and timely manner.  \n \nThe following section describes key components parts of the BGS cyber-\ninfrastructure, relating specifically to management of knowledge acquired by \ngeological survey programmes, and discusses some of the lessons learned and future \ndevelopments. \n \n3. Geological surveying and knowledge management \n \n3.1 Geological maps as explicit knowledge \n \nSince the first national examples produced by William Smith (1815), geological maps \nhave been used to synthesise and communicate explicit knowledge on the \nstratigraphy, structure and composition of the Earth\u2019s surface and shallow subsurface. \nTogether with the map marginalia, which typically include a scale cross-section and a \ngeneralised vertical section of the stratigraphy, a geological map provides a 2 \ndimensional representation of a 4 dimensional domain (considering geological time as \nthe 4th dimension). In the hands of a trained geologist, the third and fourth dimension \ncan be partially reconstructed from the stratigraphical and structural information \npresented on the map and marginalia, without reference to other information.  \n \nGeological maps, together with associated narrative publications, have therefore been \nthe principal form of explicit knowledge output of GSOs, and form the core of a \nnational geoscience evidence base. However, basic differences in national geology \nand socio-economic drivers have led to different approaches to national geological \nsurvey programmes, especially in terms of priorities, resolution and the downstream \ndeliverables. In the UK, factors such as the highly varied geology, high degree of \nurbanisation, long legacy of industrial development and a complex regulatory and \nplanning framework combine to create a demand for high-resolution geological \nmapping at 1:10,000 scale. From the late 1970s onwards, demand increased in the UK \nto produce thematic geological maps, mainly based on 1:10 000 scale mapping, aimed \nspecifically at planners and developers (Smith and Ellison, 1999). The objective of \nthese products was to unlock and communicate some of the additional, implicit \nknowledge on resources, hazards and constraints that are \u2018hidden\u2019 on a standard \ngeological map. Initially these demands were met by providing packages of \nenvironmental geology maps and associated guidance reports but, in the 1990s, GIS \nand decision-support systems began to replace these products (Culshaw, 2005). This \nhas driven the development in BGS of cartographic production systems designed to \ndigitally capture information from pre-existing paper geological maps, including both \npre-existing published maps and geologists\u2019 hand-drawn draft maps created by new \nsurveys. This stimulated major investments in digital capture of the entire dataset of \n1:50 000 scale geological maps (DiGMapGB50) of Great Britain, which was \ncompleted in 1999 (Jackson and Green, 2003), and the subsequent capture of 1:10 000 \nmaps, currently in progress.  \n \nAlthough geological and thematic maps have served the geoscience user community \neffectively for nearly 200 years, they have some basic deficiencies as a \ncommunication medium for explicit, spatially located 3D geological information \n(Loudon, 2000). In particular, the knowledge they convey is explicit in 2D, but \nlargely implicit in 3 and 4D. The most serious knowledge gaps are in shallow \nsuperficial deposits, and at depth in the bedrock below major unconformities. \nSuperficial deposits, especially those of glacigenic origin, can be highly complex \nstratigraphically and geometrically, and are characterised by the presence of many \ndisconformities and high lenticularity of individual depositional units. Much of the \nUK is covered with such deposits, which vary in thickness from less than 1 metre to \nseveral tens of metres. Geological maps conventionally show the superficial deposits \nmapped at surface but may provide a very unreliable prediction of the subsurface, \neven at depths of only one or two metres. Similarly, typical bedrock geology maps do \nnot indicate the subsurface geology below major unconformities. For example, below \nthe south-eastern part of Great Britain and adjacent offshore areas, the published \ngeological maps provide little, spatially located information on the geology below the \nunconformable base of Permian and Triassic rocks, despite the considerable amount \nof interpreted information available on the underlying Carboniferous rocks available \nfrom borehole and seismic data. The latter information is published in narrative \nmemoirs and generalised subsurface geology maps at much lower resolutions. \n \nUnfortunately, these information gaps coincide with those parts of the subsurface \nwhere information is in greatest demand from the user community (Walton and Lee, \n2001). Shallow (less than 20 metre depth) 3D geological knowledge, associated with a \nholistic understanding of processes, is required by a diverse community of users, \nincluding engineering, waste management, environmental assessment, planning and \nenvironmental regulation and aggregate mineral exploration and exploitation (Fookes, \n1997; Culshaw, 2005). Deeper, spatially accurate geological information, once mainly \nrequired for exploration and management of hydrocarbon, coal, groundwater and \nmetalliferous mineral resources, is now in increasing demand for implementation of \nnewer technologies such as clean coal, underground gas storage, nuclear waste \ncontainment, and deep storage of carbon dioxide. For all these applications of \ngeological knowledge, an indication of the level of confidence in the 3D interpretation \nis required to enable users to make appropriate \u2018risk-informed\u2019 decisions, but is \ncommonly not available except in the most rudimentary of forms. \n \n \n3.2 Geological mapping and knowledge capture \n \nThe capability to visualise subsurface geology in 3 and 4 dimensions is an essential \nskill for a mapping geologist. Geological mapping involves an iterative process of \nobservation, recording, conceptualisation and interpretation (Loudon and Laxton, \n2007). From the first moment of fieldwork, a geologist assembles a mental 3 and 4 \ndimensional model of stratigraphy and structure, and this is then iteratively adjusted \nas more observational evidence is accumulated (Jones et al., 2004; Kastens and \nIshikawa, 2006). As this model develops, the geologist continues to test and refine \ntheir interpretation against the available prior information, including his or her own \nknowledge and understanding of geological processes and concepts (Loudon and \nLaxton, 2007). The mapping geologist will also develop an appreciation of the \ninterdependencies (and inconsistencies) between data and interpretation, and will also \nevolve an impression of their confidence (or degree of certainty) in their model, \nthough this may be highly subjective, dependent on previous experience or bias, and \nmay even be influenced by pressures to conform with fashionable concepts and \nscientific trends (Jones et al., 2004; Bowden, 2004; Baddeley et al., 2004). While in \nthe field, the geologist will also acquire, though not necessarily formally record, a \nrange of other contextual geoscience knowledge including relationships between \ngeology and the built environment, hazards, land use, ecology and heritage. In the \nBGS, much of this contextual knowledge is developed by experience of working on \nother knowledge exchange activities elsewhere in the BGS programme (see above). \n \nFigure 3 illustrates a generic workflow for a typical geological survey project in BGS \nand the explicit knowledge captured at each stage. Traditionally, knowledge \nmanagement in the workflow has typically focussed on the archiving of all data and \ninformation that contributes directly to the delivery of the published or released, \ndigital and analogue map and text outputs, but this has left much implicit knowledge \nremaining in the minds of the geologist (Figure 4).  \n \nDuring the last 5 years BGS has invested heavily in its IT infrastructure and data \ndigitisation, investing capital to upgrade its storage area networks (SANs) and \nincreasing the bandwith for its internal communications between itself and with other \nnodes on  JANET, the UK\u2019s Joint Academic NETwork that links universities, \nresearch centres and other higher education establishments.   In parallel, three major \nnew components of the BGS cyber-infrastructure have been developed and \nimplemented that help make explicit much of the implicit knowledge acquired by new \ngeological surveys. These are: \n \n\uf0b7 BGS Project Management System \n\uf0b7 SIGMA (System for Integrated Geoscience MApping) \n\uf0b7 DGSM (Digital Geoscience Spatial Model) \n \nThese systems were originally developed with separate, specific objectives in mind, \nbut are gradually converging, though continual development, into an integrated \nknowledge management system with the following main objectives (cf. McCaffrey et \nal., 2006): \n \n\uf0b7 Capture and communicate geologists\u2019 3 and 4D perception of subsurface \ngeology acquired by geological survey projects \n\uf0b7 Ensure all data and knowledge is recorded using common, documented \nstandards to promote wider interoperability and data and knowledge exchange \n\uf0b7 Speed up the process of data and knowledge capture and delivery \n\uf0b7 Ensure knowledge capture is carried out in the context of prior information, \ni.e. it builds on and augments prior information, without re-inventing it \n\uf0b7 Ensure that the data and knowledge capture process is verifiable, repeatable \nand auditable \n\uf0b7 Record a greater proportion of implicit knowledge \n\uf0b7 Differentiate observation from interpretation, as far as practically possible \n\uf0b7 Record and communicate the sources of information and uncertainty involved \nin the interpretation process. \n \nFigure 4 illustrates the implicit knowledge captured by the main components of the \ninfrastructure, which are described in the following section. \n \n \n \n4. BGS Cyber-infrastructure for geological survey knowledge management \n \n4.1 BGS Project Management System (PMS) \n \nThis was developed and implemented in 2003 as a workflow-based information \nsystem to help formalise the approach to project management in BGS, and manage the \nassociated project information. It holds information on business case, project \ninitiation, aims and objectives, project plans, financial information, and project \nreview. The PMS workflow leads project teams through the key steps in the life cycle \nof a project based on the PRINCE2 project management method, which is now widely \nrecognised as the de facto standard for project management in the UK1.  The PMS \nwas designed around an Oracle 9 instance and customised using ColdFusion. \n \nWhile the PMS might appear peripheral, at first sight, to the objective of geoscience \nknowledge management, it contains project planning information on the approach, \nmethodologies, resources and expertise deployed that is critical for understanding the \nvalue, limitations and certainty of the geological interpretations delivered by a BGS \nsurvey project. In particular, all objects (e.g. field observations, geological \nboundaries, outcrop polygons, geological surfaces) captured in BGS digital maps and \nmodels using the SIGMA and DGSM systems (see below), are linked to the \nknowledge held in the PMS by a unique project code attribute. It is therefore possible, \nfor example, to interrogate individual objects in the BGS digital map and model \ndatabases and determine, through cross-reference to the PMS, whether the object was \nrecorded by a field geological survey, an air photo reconnaissance, or by a desk \nrevision carried out as part of an applied geoscientific project commissioned by a \nspecific client. The PMS also stores knowledge of lessons learned and new methods \nadopted by the survey project that contribute to the upgrade of procedures and best \npractice in the SIGMA and DGSM systems. A major upgrade to the PMS in 2008 will \nstrengthen its integration with these other cyber-infrastructure systems. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1 PRINCE2 \u2013 Projects In a Controlled Environment  - \nhttp:\/\/www.ogc.gov.uk\/methods_prince_2__overview.asp \n4.2 System for Integrated Geoscience MApping (SIGMA) \n \nSIGMA is a Geographic Information System (GIS) application that links spatial \nsearch and assembly, digital field data recording, digital geological map compilation \nand map production2. The system was designed around the geological survey \nworkflow (Figures 3 and 4) and integrates with the PMS and the 3D modeling \nsystems in the DGSM. The system is built around the ESRI ArcGIS 9.x software \nsuite, and captures geological data and knowledge into a relational, feature\/attribute \ndata model implemented in an ArcGIS geodatabase.  Following validation at key \nstages in the workflow, the geodatabase is uploaded and managed in the corporate \nBGS Oracle relational database, and provides the data for subsequent production of \nboth digital and printed BGS geological maps and a range of other, derived \ninformation services and products. Customisation of the ArcGIS desktop was \nperformed using ArcObjects (the ArcGIS software component library), mainly with \nVBA and vb.NET development tools.  Within this system application, most parts of \nArcGIS suite are used in the workflow development (ArcMap, ArcCatalog, ArcGlobe \nand ArcSDE).  Corporate data from Oracle and other sources are loaded to and from \nthe BGS SAN as shapefiles, grids, SDE feature classes and SDE raster datasets and \ncatalogues.  \n \nSIGMA is designed for use by all BGS survey geologists and replaces the former \npaper-based map and notebook systems for recording field data and compiling \ngeological maps. The digital field data capture component (MIDAS \u2013 Mobile \nIntegrated Data Acquisition System), which operates on a ruggedized Tablet PC, has \nbeen deployed to 66 individual mapping geologists, with an equipment \u2018pool\u2019 of 20 \nfurther systems available for other uses (e.g. landslide surveys, field sample \nrecording). All BGS mapping geologists now use SIGMA on their desktop for map \ncompilation and, at the delivery end of the workflow, the system is used by GIS \nspecialists, data managers and cartographers for data quality control and map \nproduction. MIDAS uses a \u2018digital field map\u2019 interface linked to a \u2018digital field \nnotebook\u2019 application consisting of data recording forms, freeform notes, sketches \nand photograph annotation (Figure 5) to encompass the full range of structured and \n                                                 \n2 SIGMA - http:\/\/www.bgs.ac.uk\/science\/3dmodelling\/sigma.html \ncontextual data and knowledge captured by fieldwork (Jordan et al., 2005). The \n\u2018digital field map\u2019 uses a customised ArcMap interface to enable geological notes, \nfeatures and boundaries to be recorded against a range of backdrop reference data \nincluding existing geological maps (raster and vector), aerial photographs, digital \nterrain models and topographic maps. A simple sketch tool enables rapid drawing of \nfreeform sketch objects (e.g. topographic features), which are subsequently converted \nto attributed geodatabase objects by selecting a single icon on the customised digital \nfield map interface. The \u2018digital field notebook\u2019 application is launched from the field \nmap window by selecting from a set of icons,  each of which represents a specific \nnotebook \u2018page\u2019 for recording data such as structural measurements, section logs, \nsketches,  or sample metadata records. Each notebook record is positioned either by \nselecting a map location or by a Global Positioning System (GPS) location.  A \nrelational data model enables multiple entries to be recorded at a specific site and also \nallows explicit links between objects, for example one or more photographs or \nsketches of a logged section. Earlier versions of the system implemented on a palmtop \nPDA (Personal Digital Assistant) platform did not provide the geologist with a large \nenough screen for map-based observations or the capability for creating relational \nlinks between the diverse data and knowledge types captured during fieldwork \n(Jordan et al., 2005; see also Clegg et al., 2006). \n \nAll objects in the SIGMA data model have a unique identifier constructed from the \ndate, time and the user\u2019s identifier code. Each object can also be attributed with \ninformation on certainty, information sources, and freeform contextual notes, so that \nexplicit knowledge on lineage of interpretations can be captured. The system enables \nobservations and interpretations made in the field \u2013 \u2018in full view of the geology\u2019- to \nbe distinguished from interpretations made at the field base or on return to the office, \nbased on other geological data. This distinction can commonly be blurred on paper-\nbased systems (Jones et al., 2004). Prior information imported into the system and \nconsidered in the interpretation process is also recorded in the ArcGIS .mxd project \nworkspace file. Hierarchical classification schemes and nomenclature for key \nattributes of stratigraphy3 and lithology4 used in the system are published on the BGS \n                                                 \n3 BGS Lexicon of Named rock units - http:\/\/www.bgs.ac.uk\/lexicon\/lexicon_intro.html \n4 BGS Rock Classification Scheme - http:\/\/www.bgs.ac.uk\/bgsrcs\/home.html \nwebsite, and documentation of the other standards used is currently in progress for \neventual release. \n \nSIGMA was initially designed to support knowledge capture for 2D geological \nmapping, but will continue to be adapted and integrated with the 3D modeling \nsystems in the DGSM to augment its capability for 3D and 4D knowledge capture in \nthe fieldwork environment. At present, the 3D geological model is not captured until \nthe geologists have returned from the field and recorded the bulk of their conceptual \nmodel in 2D form, resulting in some loss of knowledge and potential inconsistencies \nwith observations made in the field. While 3D field data capture methods such as \nterrestrial laser scanning (Hodgetts et al., 2004; McCaffrey et al., 2005) are advancing \nrapidly, capture of geologists\u2019 implicit 3D knowledge in the field remains a \nsignificant challenge and is likely to await the development of more effective, \nportable 3D and augmented reality visualisation systems (McCaffrey et al., 2005) \n \n4.3 Digital Geoscience Spatial Model (DGSM) \n \nProficient mapping geologists will always have some kind of 3D representation in \ntheir mind as they develop an understanding of an area they are investigating (Kastens \nand Ishikawa, 2006).  During the last 25 years, computing technology and the cyber-\ninfrastructure that goes hand in hand with its development have progressed to allow \nthe geologist to encode this implicit mental image, along with the tacit \u2018experience \nand know-how\u2019 that constructed it, into an explicit information product.  Although \nmany commercial companies in the petroleum and mining industries have developed \ntheir own 3D cyber-spaces, GSO organisations have taken only limited steps towards \nthe construction of national scale 3D frameworks.  It was clear that a leap of faith was \nrequired to build such a national scale knowledge base, and incorporate forms of \nknowledge that have conventionally been regarded as tacit. \n \nThe DGSM was originally mooted in BGS in the late 1970s in an unpublished internal \nreport by Vic Loudon, and conceived as a hypermedia repository for 3D geological \nknowledge of the UK. However, it has taken well over a quarter of a century for the \nnecessary information technology to become available and affordable, and the \nunderstanding of human computer interactions to become sufficiently mature, to make \nthis vision a practical proposition (Loudon, 2000). In 2005, BGS published a strategy \nfor development of a National Geoscience Framework (British Geological Survey, \n2005), which will eventually establish 3D spatial models or \u2018LithoFrames\u2019 (Smith, \n2005) at the core of the evidence base for UK geology, replacing the geological map. \nThe DGSM research and development project commenced in 2000 to establish the \nmodeling methodology and cyber-infrastructure required to begin work on this long-\nterm objective, with deployment of the completed system in 2005. \n \nThe knowledge framework of the DGSM has 7 main components, summarised below \nand described in more detail by Smith (2005). Figure 6 illustrates the flow of \ninformation between various parts of the system. \n \nData portal. This provides an essential bridge between the BGS corporate databases \nand the modeling software used by the geologists. The portal utilizes web-based GIS \nsystems to interrogate, preview, download and convert data such as terrain models \nand borehole data into the formats required for use in specific 3D modeling software \npackages. \n \nInformation and software standards.  Geoscientific data standards, dictionaries and \nthesauri for geoscientific description, classification and mark-up of the spatial models \nand associated texts, and for the software used in the modeling process, are an \nessential part of the DGSM knowledge framework. Many of these standards have \nbeen in place in BGS for over two decades, and have been updated and adapted to \nmeet the DGSM requirement. The standards allow the knowledge content of the \nspatial models to be attributed, communicated and reproduced in a consistent way, \nand facilitate its wider interoperability. Mark-up standards have contributed to the \ninternational collaboration to develop a generic XML schema called GeoSciML \n(Geoscientific Mark-up Language) (Cox et al., 2005, see also section 6 below). \n \nGeoscience large object store. The GLOS provides storage for 3D models, \nvisualizations and associated metadata in their individual proprietary software format. \nDepending on the software used, the modle may consist of a single file or (as in \nGoCAD) a number of separate files, each representing a single object or groups of \nsimilar objects in the model. Metadata for each object (see below and Figure 7) is \nstored alongside the model in the GLOS. \n \nGeoscience spatial framework \u2014 The GSF provides a non-propriety data store for \nmodels to ensure that their geometric form and geoscientific properties are shareable \nand preserved. It is a relational database that stores the complete set of 3D points \ncontained in each model, linked where applicable to the geological surface identifier \nand, via the standard BGS dictionaries, to their geoscientific attributes (Hatton et al., \n2005). Although it is recognized that storage in the GSF can result in loss of some \ninformation and knowledge, it provides secure long term storage and delivery of \ninformation in software independent format. \n \nMetadata. DGSM metadata is the key component of the DGSM that captures the \nexperts\u2019 implicit knowledge about the source and lineage of the spatial interpretation \nembodied in the model (Figure 7). In the survey and modeling workflow, geologists \nexamine data from many external sources; this is recorded in the metadata, together \nwith the associated reasoning and reconciliation processes. The resulting knowledge \nbase can be filtered for relevant material, and searched with a variety of spatial or \ntext-based queries. The metadata system has four main components. \u2018Data\u2019 metadata \ndescribes the data subset used to create the model, its derivation and the criteria for \nincluding or excluding data items. \u2018Model\u2019 metadata provides information describing \nthe model, and the purpose for which it was constructed. This is also linked via a \nproject code identifier to knowledge about the objectives, conduct and purpose of the \nproject held in the PMS (see above). \u2018Inference\u2019 metadata describes how particular \ndata was interpreted and interpolated to create the model, and a qualitative assessment \nof the fitness of the data for that purpose. All three metadata types have been mapped \nonto the ISO 19115 international metadata standard, and implemented in a relational \ndatabase structure. Finally, \u2018keywords\u2019 provide a simple way of finding the model and \ndescribing its content. A Geoscience Thesaurus, based on that of the Australian \nMineral Foundation, is under continued development in BGS to enable the knowledge \nembedded in models to be linked semantically to its wider scientific and \nenvironmental context (see section 6 below).  \n \nUncertainty. The DGSM system for communicating the inherent uncertainty in a 3D \nmodel focuses on a combination of geostatistical analysis methods and capture of \nqualitative, implicit knowledge from the geological and technical experts who built \nthe model. Work is continuing on methods of communicating knowledge about \nuncertainty to the model user. Qualitative uncertainty assessment involves an initial \nbrainstorming meeting of the survey and modeling project team to exchange \nknowledge and catalogue the sources of uncertainty feeding into the modeling \nprocess, involving construction of a \u2018fishbone\u2019 or Ishikawa diagram. A fuzzy logic \nrule set analyses the components of uncertainty derived from the Ishikawa analysis to \ncharacterise every point or object in the model with a numerical value, which can then \nbe visualised in 3D alongside the model. Since the risks associated with geological \nuncertainty vary from user to user, the outputs of the DGSM uncertainty system will \nbe evaluated by users of BGS models to provide feedback on their suitability for input \ninto their risk assessment procedures. \n \nBest practice. The DGSM best practice system enables procedures adopted by the \ntechnical experts in building models to be documented, shared, and where \nappropriate, flagged as \u2018best practice\u2019. In the present system, documents are captured \nconventionally by word processor and held in a text database linked to a web-based \nsearch and retrieval system, which also enables model outputs to be linked to the \u2018best \npractices\u2019 used to create them. Wiki-type systems are currently being trialled to \ndevelop a more consensus based-approach to developing and documenting best \npractice. \n \nThe DGSM is adaptable to inter-operate with a range of commercially available \nsoftware for 3D modeling. Software was evaluated extensively at the start of the \nDGSM development project and has been kept under review since then. To facilitate \n3D knowledge capture and delivery, BGS has sought to implement software that is \nsimple and intuitive enough for deployment to its entire complement of survey \ngeologists. A key requirement is that the software must allow the geologist to remain \nin control of the spatial interpretation by easily combining input of interpolations \nbased on their own knowledge and experience with the more rapid mathematical \ninterpolation provided by the software. In this way, the tacit knowledge of the \ngeologist and the computational power of the software can combine cost effectively \nand harmoniously to capture and communicate the spatial geological model. The \nDGSM knowledge management system enables the manual and computerised \ninterpolations to be clearly distinguished. At present, the BGS has deployed Insight \nGmBH GSI3D (Geological Surveying and Investigations in 3D) software for 3D \nmodeling to meet the above requirements. GSI3D\u2019s current limitations to geological \ndomains of low structural complexity are being addressed with a major software \nupgrade, due for completion and deployment in BGS from 2010. GoCAD software is \ncurrently used in BGS for 3D modeling of regional extensional basins and structurally \ncomplex areas, and for specialised volumetric and properties modeling applications. \n \nTo draw the DGSM knowledge capture components together into a coherent system, a \nworkflow based application has been developed that leads the user through the spatial \nmodeling process, via a series of key steps (Figure 8). These ensure contextual and \ntimely capture of metadata and information about uncertainty and best practices. \nChecklists built into the workflow system enable repeatability and audit of the \nmodeling and knowledge capture process. The DGSM workflow system and its \nvarious components were deployed in 2005 and have been used routinely since then \non all BGS 3D modeling projects for a variety of clients. \n \nAs population of the BGS 3D knowledge base proceeds, the technologies developed \nby DGSM will, with continual development, enable the BGS to offer a more \ncomprehensive spatial geoscientific interpretation, linked to more relevant and \naccurate contextual knowledge. DGSM extends the national geoscience knowledge \nbase, ready for the next wave of technology. The internet is evolving into the grid \u2014 a \nubiquitous knowledge infrastructure, supporting web services that hide complexity \nfrom the users, but to be shared by all and increasingly taken for granted. Geological \nsurvey knowledge management may evolve in parallel, to occupy a future niche as a \nset of web services integrated within the mainstream standards of the global \nknowledge system. Taken together, the DGSM, SIGMA and related components of \nthe BGS cyber-infrastructure provide an example of the initial steps that GSOs will \nneed to take to enhance their knowledge management capabilities and prepare for this \nrevolution.  \n \n \n5 Cyber-infrastructures for geoscience knowledge exchange and management \n \nFrom its position as a single national GSO, BGS has focused on developing, capturing \nand exploiting its implicit and tacit knowledge assets. Other countries with regional \nGSOs have needed to respond to additional challenges to exchange and utilize their \ncollective datasets and knowledge bases.  \n \nThe national organisational model of regional GSOs, with or without an over-arching \nfederal GSO, has tended to develop in countries with more distributed regional \ngovernance and regulatory systems, and where the large size of the country presents \nmajor logistical challenges for execution of national survey programmes. In these \ncountries, a more diverse range of standards, practices and data models have emerged, \nover decades of systematic survey and data collection, that have constrained the \npotential for collaborative knowledge management. It is therefore not surprising that \nthese countries are now leading the way in the development of inter-agency cyber-\ninfrastructures, common standards and vocabularies for geoscience knowledge \ndiscovery and exchange. \n \nIn the last decade, large geoscientific organisations such as the national, state and \nprovincial GSOs in Canada (Canadian Geoscience Knowledge Network, CKGN6) and \nAustralia (Solid Earth and Environment GRID, SEEGRID7) have been developing \ntheir knowledge networks with notable success.  National, state and provincial \nsurveys in North America have joined forces to develop the North American Geologic \nMap Data Model, with the goals of standardizing methodologies for the management \nand distribution of digital geologic-map information, and developing common \nvocabularies, data standards and interchange formats to make the knowledge \ncontained in these maps accessible and useable by all. Globally, a number of GSOs \nhave also adopted a collaborative approach to attempt to identify and codify their \nknowledge bases in a logical and consistent manner.  To achieve this, much \ninternational, collaborative effort has gone into standardizing geological data \ninterchange models, using the IUGS Commission for the Management and \n                                                 \n6 The Canadian Geoscience Knowledge Network. - http:\/\/cgkn.net\/cur\/index_e.html \n7 Solid Earth and Environment GRID, SEEGRID - \nhttps:\/\/www.seegrid.csiro.au\/twiki\/bin\/view\/Main\/WebHome \nApplication of Geoscience Information8 initiative as a major driver (Cox et al., 2005).  \nThe work completed by the CKGN, the CGI and other international geoscience \nnetworks has enhanced the capture and sharing of explicit and implicit knowledge \nwithin the geoscience realm and its accessibility to more diverse scientific \ncollaborators and the wider stakeholder community. \n \nAgain in North America, the Geosciences Network (GEON)9 project illustrates how \ncollaborative geoscience knowledge cyber-infrastructures may evolve in future, and \ndemonstrates their exciting potential for the eventual globalisation of geoscience \nknowledge exchange. GEON is led mainly by a consortium of universities in the \nUnited States, but is gradually broadening its associations with national and regional \nGSOs, other agencies and industry across North America. GEON\u2019s aim is to drive a \nmore quantitative understanding of the 4D evolution of the North American \nlithosphere by using advanced information technologies to support \u201cintelligent\u201d \nsearch, semantic data integration, and visualization of multidisciplinary information \nand 4D earth science data. Currently, GEON offers a range of resources including 3D \nand 4D geoscience data and software tools for interpretation and visualisation. In the \nfuture, it will provide controlled vocabularies, hierarchical classifications and \nontologies for knowledge representation, discovery and exchange. \n \n6 An ontology-based knowledge management future for the geosciences \n \nDiscovering and exploiting the wealth of knowledge available on the World Wide \nWeb, whether offered by GSOs, formal geoscience knowledge networks or the wider \ngeological research and user community, involves extending the role of ontologies \n(Agarwal, 2005).  Ontology development focuses on representing concepts or objects \nand their properties, relationships and hierarchies, and typically expresses explicit and \nstable or uncontested knowledge.  As already discussed, there is considerable value to \nbe gained from capture of implicit knowledge, and new types of geoscience products \nsuch as digital 3D models can tease out and crystallize some of the tacit, experience-\nbased knowledge formerly hidden in conventional outputs such as geological maps.  \n                                                 \n8 IUGS Commission for the Management and Application of Geoscience Information -  \nhttp:\/\/www.cgi-iugs.org\/welcome.html \n9 The Geosciences Network (GEON) - http:\/\/www.geongrid.org\/ \nIf this implicit knowledge can be captured by effective knowledge management, and \nexchanged in collaborative cyber-infrastructures, the future of geoscience may see \nontology-based, computational agents discovering new emergent knowledge from \nthese ever-expanding oceans of information, crossing disciplinary boundaries and \nreasoning with competing knowledge sources.  \n \nLoudon and Laxton (2007) provide a roadmap of how ontologies can be implemented \nby GSOs to help capture and exploit knowledge assets, and develop 3D digital \nknowledge bases. Ontologies can also help with automated processes to discover and \nharness knowledge locked within the often huge archives of paper records and \npublications held by GSOs. The National Borehole Information Capture (NBIC) \nproject in BGS is deploying ontologies to assist with conversion of paper borehole \nrecords into digital formats that can be used for 3D Modeling applications. BGS holds \nin excess of 1.5 million paper borehole records donated by third parties and drilled for \nvarious purposes, such as geotechnical investigations and exploration for mineral \nresources, groundwater, coal and oil. Major investment has already been made to scan \nthese data, but use in 3D modeling projects still requires time-consuming, manual \ncoding of each record into a structured data format that is useable by modeling \nsoftware. For NBIC, the scanned data is first converted into machine-readable format \nusing Optical Character Recognition. A domain-specific ontology is being developed \nto support the capture of lithological information from these boreholes and codify the \noutput, together with depth, into the BGS Borehole Geology digital downhole \ndatabase. The original paper databases contain records accumulated over many \ndecades, with highly variable lithological terminology and, in some cases, use of \nobscure, vernacular terms. The ontology is being developed from the hierarchical \nBGS Rock Classification Scheme and the BGS Geoscience Thesaurus (see above), \naugmented by translations of older vernacular terminology. The project is in its early \nstages, but it is expected that the ontology will develop and grow to enable wider, \nenvironmental data and knowledge to be discovered and captured from a wider set of \nhistorical text-based datasets held by BGS, and allow information to be codified for \nweb delivery and for downloads to BGS clients in various industry-standard digital \nformats. More widely, BGS is participating with many other GSOs in the \ndevelopment of GeoSciML10 (Geoscientific Mark-up Language). This is a major \ninternational initiative, led by the IUGS Commission for the Management and \nApplication of Geoscience Information, to develop and codify agreed concept \ndefinitions for the geosciences.  The semantics of these definitions are not yet being \nformalised, however the objective of this work is that it will lead eventually to the \ndevelopment of formal geoscience ontologies, and support the discovery and use of \nobjects referenced with those ontologies within and across agencies. \n \nKnowledge gains value when it can be used in some way, such as in a scientific \nworkflow that supports decision-making by a client.  There is much knowledge about \nhow to analyse, manage, visualise and apply geological information that either lies \nlatent in a scientist\u2019s mind or is expressed in a software specific language.  Being able \nto express the semantics of that knowledge in ontologies is critical to support the \nfuture of geological research in a grid environment (Loudon and Laxton, 2007).  \nResearch into expressing the semantics of scientific workflows provides the first steps \nto converting this type of knowledge into a form that can enhance scientific research, \nfacilitate interoperability and provide cross-disciplinary access to new data and new \nservices (Berkley et al.,  2005).  \n \nRecent developments in the World Wide Web community have raised the question of \nknowledge reliability.  In a Web 2.0 world, where users of the web are also providers \nof information and knowledge, we see the emergence of unregulated knowledge bases \nthat are likely to compete with those provided by authoritative sources, including \nGSOs. Nevertheless, knowledge of this sort can be of huge value, and applications \nsuch as Wikipedia illustrate how a neutral and authoritative point of view can emerge \norganically from a wide community of knowledge contributors. An ontology-based \nframework that takes into account issues of trust, reputation and authority may \nprovide a way for supporting the integration of this distributed, community-based \nknowledge with institutional knowledge in order to exploit their complementary \nattributes and enhance knowledge use in a scientific context.  Collaborative research \ntools such as Wikis and virtual environments also support this new approach towards \nknowledge creation for geographically distributed participants (Page et al., 2005), and \n                                                 \n10 GeoSciML - https:\/\/www.seegrid.csiro.au\/twiki\/bin\/view\/CGIModel\/WebHome \ncan be assimilated into a knowledge base when their content attains an appropriate \nlevel of confidence. \n \nOntologies will form the basis for grid-based scientific research, from service \ndiscovery (Klien et al., 2006) to model component composition (Reitsma and \nAlbrecht, 2005), and also advance the automation of menial scientific research \nactivities. The vision of ontology-based knowledge management and use is that we \nwill be able to pose complex queries or research tasks to a software environment or \nWeb Service, and rapidly get sensible results that help us answer our questions or \ncomplete our research.   \n \nBut how do we automatically integrate such information in an emergency scenario, \nrequiring rapid and informed decisions utilising resources of variable and possibly \nquestionable reliability, provided by different service and knowledge providers?  \nKnowledge becomes more powerful when interconnecting threads can be pursued, \ndeveloped and applied by innovative, creative and lateral thinking. Such queries and \ntasks will involve connecting independently developed knowledge repositories or \nservices without requiring global agreement of terms and concepts (Berners-Lee et al., \n2006). Knowledge-based decision-making at all levels of society requires the \naccessibility, reliability and usability of knowledge to be enhanced in a grid-based \nworld. Effective knowledge capture, management and exchange will ensure that \nGSOs, as geoscience knowledge-based organisations, can make their contribution to \nthis wider goal. \n \nConclusions  \n \nAssembling the national geoscientific knowledge base, and exchange of its content \nwith stakeholders to support decision-making, are key roles of national geoscience \nsurveys. Effective knowledge management and exchange require not only effective \ndata and information management, but also an analysis of those \u2018missing\u2019 implicit and \ntacit knowledge assets that need new methods to capture and exploit. These assets \ninclude knowledge of the 3D geology, approach, inferences, uncertainty, wider \ncontext and best practice acquired during the process of geological mapping. \n \nA coherent and well-designed corporate cyber-infrastructure, linked to a familiar \nworkflow of core functions in the geological mapping and modeling process, together \nwith software that enables the geologists to easily transfer their experience and know-\nhow into 3D interpretations, enables capture of the key elements of this implicit and \ntacit knowledge. Effective management of this knowledge within GSOs will prepare \nthem for the knowledge revolution of collaborative cyber-infrastructures and grid-\nbased technologies. \n \nParticipation of GSOs in wider, national and international geoscience cyber-\ninfrastructures enables discovery, exchange and exploitation of this implicit \nknowledge and is driving the development of common data standards, interchange \nformats, best practices, workflows and scientific vocabularies that will lead eventually \nto development of geoscience ontologies. \n \nAn ontology-based future for the World Wide Web will enable greater access to tacit \nand implicit knowledge in shared geoscience knowledge bases and the wider web \ncommunity. By automating data discovery and conditioning tasks, ontologies will also \nhelp GSOs to unlock and harness the considerable knowledge assets within their \ntraditional paper records and archives. Sustained investment and international \ncollaboration is needed to capture this valuable intellectual capital and to continue \ndevelopment of the cyber-infrastructures required for wider knowledge exchange and \nexploitation. \n \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nWe thank our many colleagues at the BGS who have been involved in the \ndevelopment, testing and deployment of the DGSM and SIGMA systems since 2000. \nIn particular, Vic Loudon and Ian Smith are acknowledged for their clearly articulated \nvision and management in converting these systems from a tacit mental image to \nexplicit reality.
