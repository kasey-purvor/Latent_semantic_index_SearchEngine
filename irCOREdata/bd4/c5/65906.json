Do the dots\nconnect or are they mostly what they appear to be \u2013 just dots? Reality, according to\nBertrand Russell\u2019s famous aphorism, is either a bowl of connected jelly or a bucket\nof disconnected shot. It all depends on the observer, who, of course, is also part of\nthe reality being considered.\nAll the books under review attempt to produce some species of connective jelly to\ndescribe \u2013 even to explain \u2013 political change in the United States. Questions of\nperspective are explicitly raised in Byron Shafer\u2019s fine essay collection, The Two\nMajorities and the Puzzle of Modern American Politics. Shafer, currently housed at the\nUniversity of Wisconsin, describes the collection as the product of his time as\nAndrew W. Mellon Professor of American Government at Oxford University.\nJohn Dumbrell is Professor of Politics at the University of Leicester, Leicester LE1 7RH.\nJournal of American Studies, 38 (2004), 3, 489\u2013495 f 2004 Cambridge University Press\nDOI : 10.1017\/S002187580400876X Printed in the United Kingdom\nAccording to Shafer, his transatlantic sojourn enabled him to discern \u2018\u2018patterned\nrelationships \u2019\u2019 between American political phenomena more clearly : \u2018\u2018 some things\njust look different from a distance \u2019\u2019 (2). He also acknowledges the influence of\nOxford political history. Shafer\u2019s search is for sociological and comparative\napproaches to understanding political change, thereby gaining entry to what he\ndescribes as \u2018\u2018 the hallowed land of \u2018middle-level theory. \u2019 \u2019\u2019\nThe book\u2019s argument is complex, but may be summarized as follows : the New\nDeal era persisted until 1968, and was characterized by a national preoccupation\nwith social welfare issues. The social basis for the politics of the period was provided\nby blue-collar unionism on the Democratic side, and small business on the\nRepublican. By the 1950s, despite President Eisenhower\u2019s willingness to continue as\na custodian of the New Deal, the system was under severe strain. By 1956, a white-\ncollar, middle-class majority had emerged. Giant corporations were also gaining\nground over small business, though Shafer considers \u2018\u2018corporate gigantism\u2019\u2019 \u2013 and\nits political expression, the \u2018\u2018Modern, \u2019\u2019 Liberal Republicanism of Senator Hugh\nScott (and, indeed, of Senator Prescott Bush) \u2013 to have peaked by 1959. By the\n1960s, liberal Republicans were losing ground, while the Democratic Party was\ndominated by graduate activists, concerned with cultural, national and \u2018\u2018post-in-\ndustrial \u2019\u2019 (not Shafer\u2019s term) issues. By 1968, the \u2018\u2018era of divided government \u2019\u2019 had\nemerged, though the New Deal era party forms endured. The new period saw major\nintra-party tensions, as issue activists clashed with rank and filers. \u2018\u2018At bottom, \u2019\u2019\nwrites Shafer (59), \u2018\u2018 there were now two opposing majorities simultaneously present\nin the mass public : more liberal than the active Republican Party on economics and\nsocial welfare, more conservative than the active Democratic Party on culture and\nforeign affairs. \u2019\u2019 One majority \u2018\u2018 colonized \u2019\u2019 Congress, the other the White House.\nNeither Bill Clinton and the \u2018\u2018New Democrats \u2019\u2019 nor Newt Gingrich and the\n\u2018\u2018Republican revolutionaries \u2019\u2019 of the mid-1990s could solve the problem of cross-\ncutting majorities. George W. Bush\u2019s rhetorical 2000 \u2018\u2018compassionate conservatism\u2019\u2019\nis seen by Shafer as yet another effort to solve the puzzle of the two majorities, as\nchanging social conditions again struggled to express themselves in the \u2018\u2018old \u2019\u2019 New\nDeal party clothes.\nThe later essays in Shafer\u2019s collection provide extensive, and comparative com-\nmentary on the author\u2019s underlying \u2018\u2018 social basis \u2019\u2019 analysis. One essay is developed\nas a gloss on Vilfredo Pareto\u2019s theory of elite circulation. (Shafer discusses organized\nlabour, \u2018\u2018Modern Republicans, \u2019\u2019 the \u2018\u2018new politics \u2019\u2019 Democrats (prosperous \u2018\u2018baby\nboomers \u2019\u2019), and evangelical Protestants.) The book concludes by considering par-\nallel social\/political shifts in the UK and in the G-7 countries.\nByron\u2019s Shafer\u2019s prose is lucid \u2013 a model of clear political scientific ex-\nposition \u2013 and his insights many. Weaknesses includes a failure to treat, as an issue\nof explanatory importance, the rise of the \u2018\u2018party of non-voters, \u2019\u2019 as well as a tend-\nency to lay too much expository weight on the rather flimsy shoulders of \u2018\u2018Modern\nRepublicanism\u2019\u2019.\nH. W. Brands\u2019 The Strange Death of American Liberalism inhabits a very different\nexplanatory world. The politics of foreign policy, not the engines of social change,\noccupy centre stage. Brands sees American liberalism as \u2018\u2018 indubitably dead \u2019\u2019 and sets\nabout a hunt for the killer. The culprit \u2013 Brands\u2019 connective, explanatory jelly \u2013 is\nidentified as the ending of the Cold War, or at least the end of the Cold War\n490 Review Essay\nconsensus associated with the crisis years of the Vietnam conflict. (Brands tends\nto view the Nixon\u2013Kissinger detente as effectively terminating the Cold War.\nAccording to Brands, Americans never really accepted the return to Cold War after\n1979.)\nBrands\u2019 argument is provocative and absorbing, even if more than a little over-\nstated. Much hinges, of course, on how \u2018\u2018 liberalism\u2019\u2019 is defined. Brands has little\ntime for political philosophy. He defines \u2018\u2018 liberalism\u2019\u2019 in terms of public faith in the\nFederal Government and especially in the Presidency : \u2018\u2018whatever else it entails,\nliberalism is premised on a prevailing confidence in the ability of govern-\nment \u2013 preeminently the Federal Government \u2013 to accomplish substantial good on\nbehalf of the American people \u2019\u2019 (viii). National mobilization for the Cold War\ncaused Americans to abandon their traditional scepticism about the efficacy and\ndesirability of strong governmental activism. Domestic reform and devel-\nopment \u2013 the clearest example is President Eisenhower\u2019s Federal highway pro-\ngramme \u2013 were drawn into the \u2018\u2018national security \u2019\u2019 orbit. (Brands agrees with Shafer\nthat Ike was an entrencher of the New Deal. After 1995, Bill Clinton is seen by\nBrands as transforming into the Democratic version of Eisenhower.) During the\nCold War, progressive domestic reform served the need to present American society\nas an attractive alternative to communism. There was also a spillover effect for\npublic attitudes : \u2018\u2018 if government could be trusted on apocalyptic issues like war and\npeace in the nuclear age, it ought to be able to handle lunches for school kids and\nhealth care for old folks \u2019\u2019 (125). By the 1980s, however, the game was up. Reagan\u2019s\nposition \u2013 \u2018\u2018distrust of government at home, faith in government abroad \u2019\u2019 \u2013 was\ncontradictory, and exposed the excruciating agony of liberalism at near-death. The\nfall of the Berlin Wall put the ailing patient out of its misery. One of the book\u2019s\nstrongest sections involves a discussion of the immediate post-Cold War era, with\nhopes for a liberal \u2018\u2018peace dividend \u2019\u2019 expiring amid Federal deficits and the rise and\nrise of anti-governmentalism.\nWhile engaging in its directness, Brands\u2019 argument does lead him towards an\nunsustainable monocausalism, as well as rather cavalier treatment of phenomena\nwhich do not readily fit the Cold War template. His historical scheme causes him to\ndownplay the significance of the Progressive era \u2013 Progressives, we are told, had no\nconception of positive government \u2013 and indeed of the New Deal. For Brands, the\nsurprising feature of the 1930s was precisely how limited and restrained was the\nFederal response to the Great Depression. (It is interesting that Aaron Friedberg,\ncontra Brands and Michael Sherry, has made exactly the same argument about the\nfederal government in the era of the Cold War.1) At times, Brands is forced to\nconcede that he may be bending the explanatory stick a little too far : \u2018\u2018By no stretch\nof the imagination was the Cold War the single, or even the primary, cause of the\ncivil rights movement or the War on Poverty \u2019\u2019 (68). Some of his generalizations are\nquestionable. Contrary to Brands\u2019 opinion, President Johnson was consciously\npursuing detente before 1968. Did the Carter Presidency really accomplish \u2018\u2018 little\n1 Aaron L. Friedberg, In the Shadow of the Garrison State ; America\u2019s Anti-Statism and its Cold War\nGrand Strategy (Princeton NJ: Princeton University Press, 2000) ; Michael S. Sherry, In the\nShadow of War : the United States since the 1930s (New Haven and London: Yale University\nPress, 1995).\nReview Essay 491\nbeyond allowing conservatives time to regroup \u2019\u2019 (127)? Brands also blithely ignores\nthe mass of empirical political science literature on public attitudes towards\ngovernment. He does make the persuasive point, on the book\u2019s final page, that the\n\u2018\u2018 conservatism\u2019\u2019 of Americans (defined in terms of scepticism towards government)\nis \u2018\u2018pragmatic rather than ideological \u2019\u2019 ; the problem, however, is that this conclusion\ntends to undermine much of the preceding argument. Brands conspicuously fails to\ndiscuss a key issue raised in the Shafer essays : the rift, in both parties, between\nideological activists and pragmatic rank and file. A less important, though (so to\nspeak) strange, omission involves the failure of Brands\u2019 Strange Death to cite the work\nof George Dangerfield, who presumably gave the book its title.2\nThe original, hardback edition of The Strange Death of American Liberalism was\npublished in 2001, before the 11 September terror attacks. Brands does, however,\nraise the possibility of a major, new threat to US security causing a revival of the\nliberal faith. His rather jejune definitions of \u2018\u2018 liberalism\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018conservatism\u2019\u2019 pre-\nvent him from allowing the possibility of a \u2018\u2018conservative authoritarian \u2019\u2019 response to\nthreat. Brands\u2019 book, it must nonetheless be emphasized, is hugely enjoyable and\nstimulating.\nWilliam Howell\u2019s Power without Persuasion is less concerned to explain political\nchange than to effect a change in how we perceive Presidential power : away from\nRichard Neustadt\u2019s \u2018\u2018bargaining \u2019\u2019 model3 and towards a paradigm focussed more on\nunilateral authority. Howell actually begins his book with a reference to President\nGeorge W. Bush\u2019s post-9\/11 \u2018\u2018flurry of unilateral directives to combat terrorism. \u2019\u2019\nBesides dethroning the Neustadt \u2018\u2018bargaining \u2019\u2019 model \u2013 Howell argues that con-\nsensus views on the Presidency tend to overestimate the importance of personal\nskills and qualities \u2013 Power without Persuasion has two other main objectives. Howell\nseeks to clarify the muddy waters of unilateral authority : the world of executive\norders, national security directives and proclamations. He also develops a formal,\nrational choice model of Presidential direct action. Presidential discretion depends\non the ability of Congress, and the inclination of the courts, to challenge the uni-\nlateral action. Howell emphasizes that, in the real political world, Congress fre-\nquently has neither the time, the information, nor any real incentive to check the\nPresident. Here he challenges not merely the Neustadt thesis, but also familiarly\ncomforting notions of executive \u2013 legislative mutual balancing over time. Howell\nnevertheless certainly does see Congress as a key constraint. He notes, for example,\nthe re-emergence of such constraint after the initial period of unilateral White House\nresponse to 9\/11. He also maintains that judges are only rarely inclined to review\ninstances of unilateral Presidential discretion, and even more rarely inclined to find\nagainst Presidents. The 1952 \u2018\u2018Steel Seizure \u2019\u2019 decision was not typical, and in any\ncase, according to Howell, is compatible with some very generous interpretations of\nthe limits of Presidential discretion.\nHowell is also concerned with explaining political change \u2013 notably with ac-\ncounting for the vast increase in President direct action since the middle years of\nthe twentieth century. He suggests that the explanation lies in a combination of\nbroadened public expectations, Congressional fragmentation, judicial insouciance\n2 George Dangerfield, The Strange Death of Liberal England (London: Constable, 1936).\n3 Richard E. Neustadt, Presidential Power : the Politics of Leadership (New York : Wiley, 1960).\n492 Review Essay\nand \u2018\u2018 the steady growth of the administrative state \u2019\u2019 (180). Many of Howell\u2019s points\nare very convincing. He is emphatically not arguing that Presidents can do, and get\naway with, whatever they want. It is correct to emphasize that unilateral action \u2013\nfrom FDR\u2019s internment of Japanese Americans in World War Two to Bill Clinton\u2019s\nuse of executive orders partially to circumvent legislative stances on health care\nand tobacco control \u2013 is of great substantive importance. Direct action enables\nPresidents to seize the initiative, exploiting the informational and collective action\nproblems attaching to Congressional retaliation. Textbooks on the Presidency, which\nfocus to a large extent on legislation, do not accord enough space to direct action.\nHowever, like Brands, Howell has a tendency to overstatement. Unilateral ac-\ntions \u2013 especially, but not entirely, executive orders \u2013 have not been ignored by\nPresidential specialists. As Howell himself shows, direct action has generated its own\nliterature ; (oddly, Howell does not cite the work of Charles Tiefer on efforts to\nbypass Congress under President George H. W. Bush).4 Howell\u2019s eagerness to usurp\nNeustadt\u2019s \u2018\u2018power to persuade \u2019\u2019 model is a little disconcerting. Are reconciliation\nand mutual adjustment between the two approaches entirely inconceivable, par-\nticularly given Howell\u2019s repeated assertions that he is still concerned to emphasize\nconstraints on executive authority? At the very least, much further investigation is\nneeded into the association \u2013 recently commented on by Richard Pious5 \u2013 between\nPresidential command and the failure to persuade.\nThe relatively narrow scope of Howell\u2019s empirical survey further calls into ques-\ntion his claim to have achieved Neustadtian regicide. Power without Persuasion does not\ntreat issues of implementation or of Federalism. National security directives, prob-\nably the most potent of all unilateralist tools available to a President, are deemed too\nimprecise and shrouded in secrecy to be susceptible to sustained political scientific\nexamination. Howell accurately details the legislature\u2019s formidable array of budget-\nary authority, but \u2013 strangely, given his focus on Presidential command \u2013 mentions\nreprogramming of funds by executive fiat only very briefly, and President Nixon\u2019s\nimpoundments of appropriated funds not at all. Expanded treatment of such issues\nwould have strengthened Howell\u2019s case (although examination of the Nixon im-\npoundments, culminating in the 1974 passage of the Congressional Budget and\nImpoundment Control Act, might also have given more weight to a more orthodox\naction\/reaction model of executive-legislative relations). Nevertheless, as it stands,\nHowell\u2019s post-Neustadtian paradigm does rest on quite a narrow base of empirical\ndata, mainly on executive orders. It must here be admitted that parts of Howell\u2019s\nexegesis \u2013 development of the formal model, pages of algebra \u2013 go beyond the in-\ntellectual competence of this reviewer. What may be concluded is that this is a work\nof high academic intelligence. It draws attention to a key facet of Presidential\nauthority, as well as making important empirical discoveries. (Howell finds, for\nexample, that executive orders are more likely to be issued under conditions of\nunified rather than divided government.)\n4 Charles Tiefer, The Semi-Sovereign Presidency : the Bush Administration\u2019s Strategy for Governing\nwithout Congress (Boulder : Westview Press, 1994).\n5 Richard Pious, \u2018\u2018Constitutional Perogatives and Presidential Power, \u2019\u2019 in George C.\nEdwards III and Philip Davies, eds., New Challenges for the American Presidency (New York:\nLongman, 2004), 211\u201328.\nReview Essay 493\nDrew Noble Lanier\u2019s Of Time and Judicial Behavior is based on a massive, and largely\noriginal, data set of Supreme Court agenda-setting and individual Justices\u2019 decisions\nbetween 1888 and 1997. Here are buckets and buckets of Russellian shot. The book\nwill be enormously valuable to historians of the Supreme Court, especially for the\npre-World War Two era, where such organized data have been scarce. Beyond the\ndiligent accumulation and codification of complex data, Lanier\u2019s approach is that of\nan institutionally oriented rational choicer : \u2018\u2018political outcomes result from indi-\nvidual, goal-oriented behavior that is determined by the limitations and oppor-\ntunities that institutions afford the political actors who function within them\u2019\u2019 (177).\nThe author\u2019s scientistic exposition does not make for lively reading. His expla-\nnations for, and discussion of, political change, such as the rise of civil liberties cases,\ncry out for the historian\u2019s understanding of social context and flux. Lanier com-\nments : \u2018\u2018 the results suggest that the behavior of the Court is not simply a function of\nthe members\u2019 unmediated policy views_ \u2019\u2019 Decisions, rather unsurprisingly, are\n\u2018\u2018 also dependent on events outside the Court building_ \u2019\u2019 (207). Not all Lanier\u2019s\nconclusions are banal. He demonstrates that \u2018\u2018 exogenous shocks \u2019\u2019 \u2013 like the Panic of\n1893 and the Great Depression \u2013 reverberate on judges\u2019 decisions for decades. He\nfinds the Fuller, White and Taft Court decisions (1888\u20131930) more liberal, at least on\neconomic issues, than often presumed. (Interestingly, Lanier takes a more expansive\nview of \u2018\u2018 liberalism\u2019\u2019 than does Brands.6)\nThe author already of a major historical and constitutional study of the Federal\nimpeachment process, Michael Gerhardt wears his considerable learning very lightly.\nHis style is lively and often partisan. Though he sees \u2018\u2018historical institutionalism\u2019\u2019 as\na way to avoid the common view that \u2018\u2018 current crises are worse than those experi-\nenced at other times, \u2019\u2019 he is clearly out of sympathy with the appointments strategy\nof the George W. Bush Administration. The Federal Appointments Process covers ju-\ndicial and executive branch nomination and confirmation, set against the dynamics\nof \u2018\u2018historical institutionalist \u2019\u2019 development. Such development is seen to be affected\nby factors such as the changing fortunes of political parties and interest groups, and\nmedia coverage of the process. Gerhardt also has light to shed on William Howell\u2019s\n\u2018\u2018direct action\u2019\u2019 thesis. Michael Gerhardt shows how Presidents can act as instigative\n\u2018\u2018norm entrepreneurs, \u2019\u2019 effecting change in the conventions of the appointments\nprocess. George W. Bush, for example, abandoned the norm of allowing the\nAmerican Bar Association to pre-screen judicial nominees. Clinton and G. W. Bush\nalso used \u2018\u2018 recess \u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018 acting \u2019\u2019\/\u2018\u2018 temporary \u2019\u2019 appointments to subcabinet posts \u2013\nevoking memories of Richard Nixon\u2019s \u2018\u2018 imperial Presidency \u2019\u2019 \u2013 in order to evade\nSenatorial \u2018\u2018 advice and consent. \u2019\u2019 Gerhardt\u2019s study, however, is located firmly within\na Neustadtian \u2018\u2018bargaining \u2019\u2019 framework. Clinton\u2019s \u2018\u2018 recess \u2019\u2019 appointments were a\nresponse to the intense hostility of key Republican committee chairmen: essentially,\n\u2018\u2018bargaining \u2019\u2019 by other means. In Gerhardt\u2019s world, actions have their reactions, and\nPresidents share power with interest groups and with Congress. Some of Clinton\u2019s\nnon-confirmed figures, notably his six chief White House counsels, were subjected\nto severe \u2013 \u2018\u2018 frequently unpleasant \u2019\u2019 \u2013 legislative scrutiny, with a consequently high\ncasualty rate.\n6 Lanier follows a definition that includes support for \u2018\u2018underdogs \u2019\u2019 in American society : Of\nTime and Judicial Behavior, 131.\n494 Review Essay\nWhat conclusions should we draw?
