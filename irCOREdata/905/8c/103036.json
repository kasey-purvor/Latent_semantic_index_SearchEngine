INTRODUCTION\nCalculation of the channel capacity for multiple-input\nmultiple-output (MIMO) system over the Rayleigh fading\nchannel has attracted considerable research interests in the past\ndecades [1]\u2013[3]. Recently, it has been shown by various au-\nthors using different methods that the mutual information (MI),\nalso known as instantaneous capacity, of the MIMO Rayleigh\nfading channel is equivalent to a Gaussian random variable\n(RV) [4]\u2013[7]. This result has been theoretically obtained for a\nlarge number of inputs and outputs of the MIMO channel and\nhas been confirmed by simulations for even a small number of\ninputs and outputs [5], [6], [8]. Moreover, this result has been\nused to obtain an approximation of the outage probability for\nMIMO system in [7]. As far as distributed MIMO (DMIMO)\nsystem is concerned, its MI has a similar formulation as the\nMI of MIMO system over the semicorrelated Rayleigh fading\nchannel when the system model for DMIMO in [9] or [10] is\nassumed. An exact computable formula of the characteristic\nfunction has been derived for this type of channel in [11]\nand the equivalence of the MI with a Gaussian RV has\nbeen suggested for a large number of antennas but has only\nbeen shown numerically. Then in [10], the equivalence has\nbeen stated and closed-form approximations of the mean and\nvariance of the MI have been derived at high signal-to-noise\nratios (SNRs) for DMIMO systems having a large number of\nnodes and antennas.\nBased on the system model presented in Section II [9],\n[10], we first prove in Section III that the MI of a m-nodes\nDMIMO system is asymptotically equivalent to a Gaussian\nF. He\u00b4liot, R. Hoshyar, and R. Tafazolli are with the Centre for Communica-\ntion Systems Research, Faculty of Electronics & Physical Sciences, University\nof Surrey, Guildford, GU2 7XH, UK (phone: +44 1483 689 492; fax: +44 1483\n686 011; E-mail: F.Heliot@Surrey.ac.uk). This work has been performed in\nthe framework of the FP7 project ROCKET IST-215282 STP, which is funded\nby the European Commission.\nRV by using random matrix theory [12] and the multiple\nsaddle point integration technique [13]. We derive the moment\ngenerating function (MGF) of the MI for a large number of\nnodes and antennas, and we show that its formulation is the\nsame as the MGF of a Gaussian RV. We obtain the moments\nof the MI by identifying them with the moments of a Gaussian\nRV. Next, we derive a closed-form approximation of the outage\nprobability for DMIMO system, which becomes tighter as the\nnumber of nodes and antennas of the system increases, by\nusing the mean and variance of the MI. Our mean and variance\nexpressions are given in terms of the roots of a polynomial\nof degree m + 1. In Section IV, we first prove that the root\nselection is unique for m = 1, we then generalize the proof for\nany m values and, hence, demonstrate the uniqueness of our\nclosed-form approximation. Accuracy of our approximation is\ndiscussed in Section V and is shown for even a small number\nof nodes and antennas. Several applications for our analysis\nare presented in Section V and, finally, conclusions are drawn\nin Section VI.\nIn comparison with the work in [11], we prove the Gaussian\nbehavior of the MI and provide an accurate closed-form\napproximation of the MI MGF that can be used for any\nconfiguration of rows and columns of the channel matrix.\nWhereas the case where the number of rows is greater than\nthe number of columns has not been tackled by the analysis\nin [11]. In addition, our approximation can be used for both\nDMIMO downlink and uplink scenarios and for any SNR\nsettings. Whereas the approximation in [10] has been designed\nfor high SNR values only. Some preliminary results of this\nwork have been presented in [14].\nII. SYSTEM MODEL\nWe consider a DMIMO communication system composed of\nseveral nodes, which are in different locations, where m base\nstations (BSs) equipped of p antennas cooperate to transmit\/\nreceive data to\/from a mobile station (MS) equipped with q\nantennas, as it is illustrated in Fig. 1. We also assume as in\n[9] and [10] that all mp antennas have a separate feeder to the\ncentral unit where all signal processing is done. The matrices\n\u03a3i and Hi represent the average path loss\/shadowing and the\nMIMO Rayleigh fading channel, respectively, between the i-\nth BS and the MS, i \u2208 {1, . . . ,m}. The equivalent channel\nmodel of the system depicted in Fig. 1 is then defined as\nH\u02dc = \u03a3 \u2299 H, where H = [H\u20201,H\u20202, . . . ,H\u2020m]\u2020, (.)\u2020 is the\nHermitian transpose operator, \u2299 is the entry-wise product\nbetween any two matrices, H\u02dc \u2208 CNr\u00d7Nt , H \u2208 CNr\u00d7Nt\nand \u03a3 \u2208 RNr\u00d7Nt+ with R+ = {x \u2208 R|x \u2265 0}. Moreover,\n2BS1\nBS2\nBS3 BSm\nMS\n      Wired or  \nwireless feeders\nCentral unit\nH3\u03a33\n.\nH2\u03a32\n.\nH1\u03a31\n.\nH\nm\n\u03a3\nm\n.\nFig. 1. Distributed MIMO system model.\n\u03a3 = \u0393 , [\u0393\u20201,\u0393\n\u2020\n2, . . . ,\u0393\n\u2020\nm]\n\u2020 and \u03a3 = \u0393\u2020 in the uplink and\ndownlink cases, respectively, with \u0393i \u2208 Rp\u00d7q+ . Furthermore,\nthe total number of transmit and receive antennas of the\nDMIMO system is defined as Nt and Nr, respectively. In the\nuplink case Nt = n = q and Nr = mp, whereas in the\ndownlink case Nt = mp, Nr = q and n = p, where n is the\nnumber of transmit antenna per node. Accordingly, the receive\nsignal r \u2208 CNr\u00d71 can be expressed as\nr = H\u02dcs+ n, (1)\nwhere s \u2208 CNt\u00d71 is the transmit signal with average transmit\npower P and n \u2208 CNr\u00d71 is the noise vector containing\nthe random noise samples from each receiver with average\nnoise power N . We assume that H is a random matrix having\nindependent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) complex circular\nGaussian entries with zero-mean and unit variance. The MI of\nthe composite channel H\u02dc, C(H\u02dc), can then be defined as\nC(H\u02dc) , \u03bb ln\n\u2223\u2223\u2223INr + \u03b3nH\u02dcH\u02dc\u2020\u2223\u2223\u2223 , (2)\nwhere \u03b3 , P\/N , \u03b3 \u2208 R+, is the average SNR, INr is a Nr\u00d7\nNr identity matrix and \u03bb = 1 if the capacity is expressed in\nnats\/s\/Hz or \u03bb = 1ln(2) if the capacity is expressed in bits\/s\/Hz.\nNotice that if p = 1 and \u0393i =\n\u221a\n\u03b3i1\n1\u00d7q, \u03b3i \u2208 R+, where 11\u00d7q\nis a 1\u00d7 q vector with all its elements equal to one, then (2) is\nthe expression of the MIMO semicorrelated Rayleigh fading\nMI [11].\nIII. CLOSED-FORM APPROXIMATION OF THE DMIMO\nOUTAGE PROBABILITY\nFollowing a similar approach as in [4] and [5], we first prove\nthat C(H\u02dc) is asymptotically equivalent to a Gaussian RV and\nthen derive its mean and variance for large values of m, p and\nq.\nThe MGF of the RV C(H\u02dc) can be expressed as\nMC(H\u02dc)(\u2212u\/\u03bb) , EH{exp[(\u2212u\/\u03bb)C(H\u02dc)]}\n= \u03c0\u2212NrNt\n\u222b\nCNr\u00d7Nt\ne(\u2212\u2016H\u2016\n2\nF )\u03c6(H\u02dc)\u2212udH,\n= \u03c0\u2212NrNt\n\u222b\nCNr\u00d7Nt\n\u222b\nCNr\u00d7u\n\u222b\nCNt\u00d7u\ne\u2212\u03c0 tr[(X\n\u2020X+Y\u2020Y)]\u03c8(H)\n\u00d7dHdXdY,\n(3)\nwhere EH{.} is the expectation over H, \u2016.\u2016F denotes\nthe Frobenius norm, tr[.] is the trace of a matrix\nand \u03c6(H\u02dc) =\n\u2223\u2223\u2223INr + \u03b3nH\u02dcH\u02dc\u2020\u2223\u2223\u2223. In addition, \u03c8(H) =\nexp\n(\n\u2212 tr\n[\nj\n(\nH\u02dcB\u2020 +BH\u02dc\u2020\n)\n+HH\u2020\n])\n, B = \u03c0\n\u221a\n\u03b3\/nXY\u2020,\nB \u2208 CNr\u00d7Nt , X \u2208 CNr\u00d7u, Y \u2208 CNt\u00d7u and u is a dummy\nvariable used in the replica method [15]. By integrating \u03c8(H)\nwith respect to H, (3) can be rewritten as\nMC(H\u02dc)(\u2212u\/\u03bb) =\n\u222b\nCNr\u00d7u\n\u222b\nCNt\u00d7u\ne\u2212\u03c0 tr[(X\n\u2020X+Y\u2020Y)]\n\u00d7 e\u2212\u03c02 \u03b3n tr[(\u03a3\u2299XY\u2020)(\u03a3\u2299XY\u2020)\u2020]dXdY.\n(4)\nLet \u0393i =\n\u221a\n\u03b3i1\np\u00d7v\n, then the following equalities (\u0393 \u2299\nXY\u2020) = (\u0393\u2299X)Y\u2020 and (\u0393\u2020\u2299XY\u2020) = X(\u0393\u2020\u2299Y\u2020) hold in\nthe uplink and downlink, respectively, with v = q in the left\nhand side and v = u in the right hand side of each equality.\nThus, (4) can be re-expressed in the uplink as\nMC(H\u02dc)(\u2212u\/\u03bb) =\n\u222b\nCNr\u00d7u\n\u222b\nCNt\u00d7u\ne\u2212\u03c0 tr[(X\n\u2020X+Y\u2020Y)]\n\u00d7 e\u2212\u03c02 \u03b3n tr[WY\u2020YW\u2020]dXdY,\n(5)\nwhere W , (\u0393\u2299X). Following some simplifications, (5) is\nmodified as\nMC(H\u02dc)(\u2212u\/\u03bb) =exp\n(\nun\n[\n(m\u03b1+ \u03b2) ln(\u03c9)+\u03b1\nm\u2211\ni=1\nln(\u03c5i)\n])\n\u00d7\n(\nn\nj2\u03c0\n)u2 \u222b\nDj\nd\n\u222b\nDg\nexp(n\u03d5(D,G))dDdG,\n(6)\nwhere \u03b1 , p\/n, \u03b2 , q\/n, \u03c5i , 1\/\u03b3i and \u03c9 ,\n1\/\n\u221a\n\u03b3. In addition, Djd , D0 + (jRu\u00d7u), Dg , G0 +\n(Ru\u00d7u), D,G,D0,G0 \u2208 Cu\u00d7u and \u03d5(D,G) , tr(DG) \u2212\n\u03b1\n\u2211m\ni=1 ln |\u03c9\u03c5iIu + D| \u2212 \u03b2 ln |\u03c9Iu + G|. At this stage, we\napply the multidimensional saddle point integration method\nin [13] for integrating the integral part of (6). After further\nderivation steps and simplifications, we obtain\nMC(H\u02dc)(\u2212u\/\u03bb)\u2192 exp\n(\nun\n[\n\u03b2 ln\n(\n\u03c9d0\n\u03b2\n)\n+\u03b1\nm\u2211\ni=1\nd0\nd0 + \u03c9\u03c5i\n+\u03b1\nm\u2211\ni=1\nln\n(\n\u03c9\u03c5i\nd0 + \u03c9\u03c5i\n)]\n+\nu2\n2\n[\n\u2212 ln\n(\n1\u2212 d\u03020g\u03020\n)])\n,\n(7)\nwhere d\u03020 = \u03b1\n\u2211m\ni=1(d0 + \u03c9\u03c5i)\n\u22122\n, g\u03020 = d\n2\n0\/\u03b2 and d0 is one\nof the m+ 1 roots of the following degree-m polynomial\nPm(d)=(d\u03c9\u2212\u03b2)\nm\u220f\ni=1\n(d+\u03c9\u03c5i)+d\u03b1\nm\u2211\ni=1\n\uf8ee\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0 m\u220f\nk=1\nk 6=i\n(d+ \u03c9\u03c5k)\n\uf8f9\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb .

Hence, the outage proba-\nbility of DMIMO system is well approximated by\nPout \u2248 Q\n(\n[\u00b5C(H\u02dc) \u2212R]\/\u03c3C(H\u02dc)\n)\n(10)\nfor large values of p, q and m > 1, since C(H\u02dc) is equivalent\nto a Gaussian RV in this case.\nIV. UNIQUENESS OF THE SELECTION OF d0\nThe mean and variance of C(H\u02dc) in (9) are both expressed\nin terms of d0. The root d0 can be selected amongst the\nm + 1 roots of Pm(d), and hence Pout in (10) would have\na unique expression only if the selection of d0 is unique for\nany given m \u2265 2. The mean \u00b5C(H\u02dc) and variance \u03c32C(H\u02dc) are\nconstrained such that \u00b5C(H\u02dc) \u2208 R and \u03c32C(H\u02dc) \u2208 R\u22c6+ with\nR\n\u22c6\n+ = {x \u2208 R+|x 6= 0}.

In addition, we simply obtain\n\u00b5C(H\u02dc) \u2208 R \u21d4 ln (\u03c9d0\/\u03b2) \u2208 R \u21d4 d0 \u2265 0. (12)\nby applying \u00b5C(H\u02dc) \u2208 R in (9). Finally, using the results in\n(11) and (12), d0 is such that\nd0 \u2208 R+ if q \u2265 pm, or d0 \u2208 [0, da) if q < pm. (13)\nThus, d0 should be appropriately selected to fulfill the con-\nstraint set in (13).\nA. MIMO case (m = 1) [7]\nIn the case of m = 1, the polynomial in (8) can be re-\nexpressed as P1(d) = d2\u03c9+ d(\u03c92\u03c51 +\u03b1\u2212 \u03b2)\u2212 \u03b2\u03c9\u03c51. Then,\nthe two roots of P1(d) are directly obtained by solving the\nquadratic equation P2(d) = 0 such that\nd1,n =\n\u2212s+ (\u22121)n\n\u221a\ns2 + 4\u03b2\u03c92\u03c51\n2\u03c9\n, (14)\nwhere s = (\u03c92\u03c51+\u03b1\u2212\u03b2). Clearly, d1,0 \u2265 0 and d1,1 \u2264 0 for\nany \u03c9, \u03c51 \u2265 0 and \u03b1, \u03b2 > 0. Therefore, the polynomial P1(d)\nhas a unique real nonnegative root, i.e. d1,0, which fulfils the\nconstraint set in (13). Furthermore, the polynomial P1(d) is\nclearly such that\nP1(d)\n{ \u2264 0 , for d \u2208 [d1,1, d1,0],\n\u2265 0 , for d \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, d1,1] \u222a [d1,0,+\u221e).\n(15)\nSince P1(\u2212\u03c9\u03c51) = \u2212\u03b1\u03c9\u03c51 \u2264 0, hence, \u2212\u03c9\u03c51 \u2208 [d1,1, d1,0].\nMoreover we know that \u2212\u03c9\u03c51 \u2264 0, it then implies that\n\u2212\u221e < d1,1 \u2264 \u2212\u03c9\u03c51 \u2264 0 \u2264 d1,0 < +\u221e. (16)\nB. DMIMO case (m \u2265 2)\nFrom the definition of Pm(d) in (8), we can express Pm(d)\nas a sequence where the initial term is P1(d) and the general\nterm is given by\nPm(d) = (d+ \u03c9\u03c5m)Pm\u22121(d) + \u03b1d\nm\u22121\u220f\nk=1\n(d+ \u03c9\u03c5k), (17)\nfor m \u2265 2. We denote \u03a5 = [\u03c51, . . . , \u03c5m] and \u03a5 =\n[\u03c51, . . . , \u03c5m], where \u03a5 is the ordered version of the vector\n\u03a5 such that 0 \u2264 \u03c51 \u2264 . . . \u2264 \u03c5m, i.e. \u03c51 = mini{\u03a5} and\n\u03c5m = maxi{\u03a5} for i \u2208 {1,m}. The values of Pm(d = \u2212\u03c9\u03c5i)\ncan be obtained by using (17), as follows, Pm(\u2212\u03c9\u03c5i)\n= \u03b1\u03c9m\u03c5i\nm\u22121\u220f\nk=1\n(\u03c5i \u2212 \u03c5k)\n\uf8f1\uf8f2\uf8f3\n= 0 , if \u03c5i = \u03c5k, i \u2208 {1,m},\n> 0 , if \u03c5i 6= \u03c5k, i \u2208 S1,\n< 0 , if \u03c5i 6= \u03c5k, i \u2208 S2, (18)\nwhere the sets S1 and S2 are defined as S1 = {m \u2212 2l| l \u2208\n{0, \u230a(m \u2212 1)\/2\u230b}} and S2 = {m \u2212 (2l + 1)| l \u2208 {0, \u230a(m \u2212\n1)\/2\u230b}, i 6= 0}, respectively, and \u230a.\u230b is the integral floor\noperator. Moreover, we consider that the polynomial Pm(d)\nhas m+1 roots denoted dm,k, k \u2208 {0,m}, which are ordered\nas follows dm,m \u2264 dm,m\u22121 \u2264 . . . \u2264 dm,0.\nIn the case that m = 2, \u03c9, \u03c51, \u03c52 > 0, \u03c51 6= \u03c52 and d1,0 >\n0, we obtain by evaluating P2(d) at d = \u2212\u03c9\u03c52, d = \u2212\u03c9\u03c51 in\n(18), and d = 0, d = d1,0 in (17), the following inequalities\nP2(\u2212\u03c9\u03c52) > 0, P2(\u2212\u03c9\u03c51) < 0, P2(0) < 0, P2(d1,0) > 0.\n(19)\nKnowing that lim\nd\u2192\u2212\u221e\nP2(d) = \u2212\u221e, \u2212\u03c9\u03c52 < \u2212\u03c9\u03c51, and\n\u2212\u03c9\u03c51 < 0 < d1,0 according to (16), it implies that the roots\nd2,2, d2,1 and d2,0 of P2(d) belong to the following intervals\n(\u2212\u221e,\u2212\u03c9\u03c52), (\u2212\u03c9\u03c52,\u2212\u03c9\u03c51) and (0, d1,0), respectively. As a\nresult, the inequality\n\u2212\u221e< d2,2\u2264 \u2212\u03c9\u03c52\u2264 d2,1\u2264 \u2212\u03c9\u03c51\u2264 0\u2264 d2,0\u2264 d1,0< +\u221e\n(20)\n45 10 15 20 25\n10\u22124\n10\u22123\n10\u22122\n10\u22121\n100\nP\no\nu\nt\n \n \nR (bits\/s\/Hz)\nPAN, \u03b3=0 dB, m=2, [\u03b31=0,\u03b32=5]\ndB, p=q=3\nPMC, ditto\nPAN, \u03b3=0 dB, m=2, [0,15] dB,\np=q=3\nPMC, ditto\nPAN, \u03b3=10 dB, m=2, [0,5] dB,\np=q=3\nPMC, ditto\nPAN, \u03b3=0 dB, m=2, [0,5] dB,\np=8, q=4\nPMC, ditto\nPAN, \u03b3=0 dB, m=2, [0,5] dB,\np=q=8\nPMC, ditto\nPAN, \u03b3=0 dB, m=4, [\u22125,0,5,10]\ndB, p=q=3\nPMC, ditto\nFig. 2.

Hence, (20) indicates\nthat, like P1(d), P2(d) has a unique nonnegative root, i.e.\nd2,0. This result has also been proved by employing a more\nformal approach in [14] and the expression of d2,0 is given\nthere. Consequently, it can be shown that Pm(d) has a unique\nnonnegative root dm,0 such that dm,0 = maxk{dm,k}, k \u2208\n{0,m}, and 0 \u2264 dm,0 \u2264 dm\u22121,0 \u2264 . . . \u2264 d2,0 \u2264 d1,0 by\nextending the same reasoning for larger m values [16]. Finally,\nd0 = dm,0 must be set in (9) for evaluating \u00b5C(H\u02dc), \u03c32C(H\u02dc)\nand eventually Pout.

NUMERICAL RESULTS AND APPLICATIONS\nOur closed-form approximation in (10) can be used to\naccurately evaluate and compare the outage probability of\nDMIMO system faster than Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations,\ne.g. 10,000 times faster when 106 channel realizations are used\nin MC.

Accuracy of our closed-form approximation in (10)\nThe accuracy of our closed-form approximation is first\ndisplayed in Fig. 2, where the outage probability which has\nbeen computed by using (10), i.e. PAN, is compared against the\noutage probability that has been obtained via MC simulation\nby considering 106 channel realizations, i.e. PMC, as a function\nof the rate R and for various SNR values, numbers of nodes\nand transmit antennas. The graph shows a tight fitness between\nPAN and PMC for the various considered settings and, hence, it\nindicates graphically the accuracy of our proposed closed-form\napproximation in (10).\nIn order to quantify the accuracy of (10) and to assess its\ndependency to the values of \u03b3, \u03b3i, m, p, q, R, we use the\nmetric \u03b5\u03b3(dB) , |\u03b3AN(dB)\u2212\u03b3MC(dB)|. It provides the absolute\n52\n4\n6\n8\n10\n1\n3\n5\n7\n9\n10\u22125\n10\u22124\n10\u22123\n10\u22122\n10\u22121\n100\nmp\n\u01eb \u03b3\n(d\nB\n)\nFig. 5. Accuracy of our closed-form approximation in (10) against the\nnumber of antennas p and number of nodes m for a m-BSs DMIMO system\nand R = 4.\ndifference in dB between the analytical SNR \u03b3AN and the SNR\nobtained via MC simulation \u03b3MC that are required to achieve a\ncertain rate R for a given outage probability Pout. The lower is\n\u03b5\u03b3(dB), the more accurate is (10). In Fig. 3 the metric \u03b5\u03b3(dB)\nis plotted as a function of p and R with \u2206\u03b3 = 5 dB for Pout =\n0.01, \u03b3 = 0 dB, m = 2, \u03b2 = 1, i.e. p = q, and considering the\ndownlink case. Notice that \u2206\u03b3(dB) , \u03b32(dB)\u2212\u03b31(dB) is the\nSNR offset between the two BSs. This graph clearly points out\nthat the accuracy of (10) increases as the number of antennas\np increases, for any rate R. In Fig. 4, \u03b5\u03b3(dB) is plotted as a\nfunction of p and \u2206\u03b3 with R = 4 and the same other settings\nas in Fig. 3. The results show that (10) is more accurate for\nlower \u2206\u03b3 values and confirm the increase of accuracy for\nlarger numbers of antennas p. Finally in Fig. 5, \u03b5\u03b3(dB) is\nplotted as a function of p and m with R = 4 for Pout = 0.01,\n\u03b3 = 0 dB, \u03b3i = 5(i \u2212 1 \u2212 \u230am\u221212 \u230b), \u03b2 = 1, i.e. p = q, and\nconsidering the downlink case. The graph indicates that the\naccuracy of (10) also increases with the number of nodes m\nbut at a lower rate than with the number of antennas p. Overall,\nwe can notice that a sufficient accuracy, i.e. \u03b5\u03b3 < 0.1 dB, is\nreached for p \u2265 2 regardless of m, R and \u2206\u03b3 . Notice that\nsimilar results have been obtained for the uplink case.\nB. Other Applications\nThe theoretical throughput of communication system can\nbe expressed as T = (1\u2212Pout)R when an unlimited backhaul\nbetween each BS and the central unit is assumed. An upper\nbound on the achievable throughput for DMIMO system can\nthen be easily obtained by using (10) in the previous equation.\nFor instance, we plot in Fig. 6 the difference \u2206T between the\ntheoretical throughput of MIMO and 2-BSs DMIMO systems\nas a function of the rate R and SNR \u03b32(dB) for the downlink\ncase when p = q = 4 and \u03b3 = 1. Moreover, we fixed \u03b31 = 1\nfor the DMIMO system and we considered an aggregate SNR\n\u03b32+1 for the MIMO system, as it is indicated in the top right\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n\u221210\n\u22125\n0\n5\n10\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\nR (bits\/s\/Hz)\n\u03b32 (dB)\n\u2206\nT\n(b\nit\ns\/\ns\/\nH\nz)\nMS1\nMS1BS1\nBS2\nBS1DMIMO:\nMIMO:\n\u03b32\n\u03b31+\u03b32\n\u03b31=1\nFig. 6. Theoretical throughput comparison between MIMO and 2-BSs\nDMIMO systems against the rate R and SNR \u03b32 (dB).\ncorner of Fig. 6, in order to fairly compare the two systems\nfor the same total amount of power. Results in Fig. 6 show\nthat a throughput gain can be achieved by using a DMIMO\nsystem instead of a MIMO system. However, this gain is quite\nlocalized; if the SNR is low, high rate cannot be supported\nand, hence, both systems are in outage, i.e. Pout = 1 and\nT = 0 for both systems (null plan on the right side of curve).\nFor low rate and high SNR, both systems are saturated and\nachieved the same throughput (null plan on the left side of\ncurve). Since, the DMIMO system saturates faster than the\nMIMO system by taking advantage of the spatial diversity, a\ngain is obtained in-between the two null regions. However, it\nshould be mentioned that DMIMO system will induce extra\ncosts in terms of backhaul load and signal processing as m\nincreases.\nThe expression \u00b5C(H\u02dc) in (9) can be used to evaluate\nEH {C(H)} for any MIMO communication systems where\nthe MI can be expressed as C(H) = \u03bb ln\n\u2223\u2223I+H\u2206H\u2020\u2223\u2223 with\n\u2206 = diag([\u03b41, \u03b42, . . . , \u03b4Nt ]) being a Nt\u00d7Nt diagonal matrix,\ni.e. the MI of a MIMO system over a semicorrelated Rayleigh\nfading channel. Especially, in the case where Nr > Nt, which\ncannot be evaluated with the computable formula in [11] and\nis likely to happen in the DMIMO uplink. In the context of\ncooperative communication [18], we designed a novel amplify-\nand-forward scheme in [19], which outperforms any other\nexisting schemes when only receive knowledge is available at\nthe relay node, by using our result in (9). In addition, (10) can\nbe used for evaluating the outage probability of the cooperative\nrelay channel, i.e. when both source and relay nodes transmit\nto the destination node.\nFollowing a similar approach as in [10], the mean and\nvariance of the MI in (9) can be used to analyze the spectral\nefficiency of DMIMO cellular system with a similar accuracy\ncompared to [10] but over a wider range of SNRs, since our\napproximations in (9) has been derived without considering\nany SNR restrictions.\n6VI. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, the MI of DMIMO system has been proved\nto be asymptotically equivalent to a Gaussian RV and its cor-\nresponding mean and variance have been derived. Both these\nterms are expressed as a function of a root of a polynomial\nwith degree m + 1. Consequently, a proof of the uniqueness\nof the selection of the root for any m values has been given.\nThen, a closed-form approximation of the outage probability\nfor DMIMO system has been derived for both downlink and\nuplink scenarios by employing the mean and variance of\nthe MI. Numerical results have shown the accuracy of our\napproximation for even low values of m, p and q, and have\nindicated that the accuracy increases mainly with the number\nof nodes and antennas of the system. In addition, several appli-\ncations for our analysis have been suggested: computation of\ntheoretical throughput, design of cooperative communication\nscheme, evaluation of the cooperative relay channel outage\nprobability and analysis of the spectral efficiency of DMIMO\nsystem.\nAPPENDIX\nDERIVATION INSIGHTS:\nA.

Then,\nMC(H\u02dc)(\u2212u\/\u03bb) can be formulated as in (6) by using |A|\u22121 =\u222b\nCNr\ne\u2212\u03c0x\n\u2020Axdx for integrating the integrand with respect to\nX and Y in (26).\n7D. From equation (6) to (7)\nIn order to asymptotically compute the integral in (6), i.e.\nfor mp, q \u2192 \u221e, we apply the multidimensional saddle point\nintegration method [13]. First, we expand the Taylor series of\n\u03d5(D,G) for D = D0 + \u03b4D and G = G0 + \u03b4G to its second\norder, and we obtain\n\u03d5(D,G)\u2248\u03d5(D0,G0)+tr[(G0\u2212\u03b1\u03a3mi=1(\u03c9\u03c5iIu +D0)\u22121)\u03b4D\n+(D0 \u2212 \u03b2(\u03c9Iu +G0)\u22121)\u03b4G+ 1\n2\n{\u03b1\u03a3mi=1(\u03c9\u03c5iIu +D0)\u22122\n\u00d7(\u03b4D)2 + 2\u03b4D\u03b4G+ \u03b2(\u03c9Iu +G0)\u22122(\u03b4G)2}]. (27)\nAccording to (27), we obtain two critical points as follows\nG0=\u03b1\nm\u2211\ni=1\n(\u03c9\u03c5iIu+D0)\n\u22121 and D0=\u03b2(\u03c9Iu+G0)\u22121. (28)\nThe matrix D0 is invariant in replica space and is thus\nproportional to the identity matrix Iu [5]. Consequently, we\nset D0 = dIu and assume that the absolute maximum of\n\u211c\u03d5(D,G) occurs for \u211c\u03d5(D0,G0). Inserting the first equation\ninto the second equation of (28) and considering that D0 =\ndIu, we obtain the polynomial equation in (8). We select one\nroot amongst the m + 1 roots of Pm(d) in (8) and denote it\nd0. We then set D0 = d0Iu and get G0 by using the first\nequation of (28). Next, we obtain\n\u03d5(D,G)\u2248\u03d5(D0,G0)+ 1\n2\ntr\n[\nd\u03020(\u03b4D)\n2+2\u03b4D\u03b4G+g\u03020(\u03b4G)\n2\n]\n(29)\nby applying D0 and G0 in (27). Inserting (29) into (6) and in-\ntegrating\n\u222b\nDj\nd\n\u222b\nDg exp\n(\nn\n2 tr\n[\nd\u03020(\u03b4D)\n2+2\u03b4D\u03b4G+g\u03020(\u03b4G)\n2\n])\n\u00d7d(\u03b4D)d(\u03b4G) along the steepest descent paths for \u03b4D and\n\u03b4G, we finally obtain the expression in (7).\nE. Equation (11)\nLet \u03c32Z \u2208 R\u22c6+, i.e. 0 < \u2212\u03bb2 ln\n(\n1\u2212 \u03b1\u03b2\n\u2211m\ni=1\n(\nd0\nd0+\u03c9\u03c5i\n)2)\n< +\u221e with (7), it implies that\n\u03c32Z \u2208 R\u22c6+ \u21d4 1 > 1\u2212\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\nm\u2211\ni=1\n(\nd0\nd0 + \u03c9\u03c5i\n)2\n> 0,\n\u21d4 0 <\nm\u2211\ni=1\n(\nd0\nd0 + \u03c9\u03c5i\n)2\n<\nq\np\n,\n(30)\nknowing that \u03b2\/\u03b1 = q\/p. Moreover, the inequality(\nd0\nd0+\u03c9\u03c5\u0302\n)2\n\u2264\n(\nd0\nd0+\u03c9\u03c5i\n)2\nholds for any i \u2208 {1,m}, with\n\u03c5\u0302 = maxi{\u03c5i}. Thus, we can write\nm\n(\nd0\nd0 + \u03c9\u03c5\u0302\n)2\n\u2264\nm\u2211\ni=1\n(\nd0\nd0 + \u03c9\u03c5i\n)2\n<\nq\np\n\u21d4 m\n(\n1\u2212 \u03c9\u03c5\u0302(2d0 + \u03c9\u03c5\u0302)\n(d0 + \u03c9\u03c5\u0302)2\n)\n<\nq\np\n\u21d4 Q(d0)=d20+2\n(\nq\nq \u2212 pm\n)\n\u03c9\u03c5\u0302d0+\n(\nq\nq \u2212 pm\n)\n\u03c92\u03c5\u03022 > 0.\n(31)\nThe two roots of the polynomial Q(d0) are then given by\nda = \u03c9\u03c5\u0302\n[\nq\npm\u2212 q +\n\u221a\npmq\n|pm\u2212 q|\n]\nand\ndb = \u03c9\u03c5\u0302\n[\nq\npm\u2212 q \u2212\n\u221a\npmq\n|pm\u2212 q|\n]\n, (32)\nrespectively, where db \u2264 da. In the case that q = pm, then\n\u03c9\u03c5\u0302(2d0 + \u03c9\u03c5\u0302) > 0 in the third line of (31) and, hence, d0 >\n\u2212\u03c9\u03c5\u0302\/2. In the case that q > pm then\n(\nq\npm \u2212 1\n)\n> 0 and,\nhence, Q(d0) is positive outside the interval [db, da]. In the\ncase that q < pm then\n(\nq\npm \u2212 1\n)\n< 0 and, hence, Q(d0) is\npositive inside the interval [db, da].\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe first author wish to thank his beloved wife for her\nsupport and helpful comments in preparing this paper.\nREFERENCES\n[1] G.
