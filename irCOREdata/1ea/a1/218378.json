P52\nThis paper sets out to integrate the role of informal institutions into the debate about\n\u201cgood\u201d governance infrastructure and corporate governance for Brazil, Russia, India,\nand China, often referred to as the BRIC economies (Goldman Sachs, 2003). We use\na case study approach to contrast the interaction of formal with informal institutions\nfor two key aspects of corporate governance: ownership structures and property\nrights; and relations between the firm and external investors. We build on the\nHelmke and Levitsky (2003) typology of informal institutions which considers the\nrelationship between formal and informal institutions to be dependent on whether\nformal institutions are effective and on how compatible are the goals of agents in\nformal and informal institutions. This interaction of formal with informal institutions\nis argued to condition these key aspects of corporate governance.\nResearch on emerging economies has emphasized the connection between\ncorporate governance structures and institutional development. Thus Steier (2009)\nargues that in emerging and developing market economies, family ownership is the\npredominant mode of governance combined with the remnants of state ownership\nand financial industrial groupings. The weakness of markets and legal and judicial\ninfrastructure make family ties highly significant and the state can also play an\nimportant role in firms\u2019 governance. Similarly in transition economies such as\nRussia, there remains poor definition and enforcement of ownership rights:\n\u201cchanging the law on the books does not guarantee corporate governance\nimprovement\u201d (Licht, Goldschmidt, and Schwartz, 2005: 230, in Steier, 2009).\nSteier emphasizes the role of corruption and black or grey markets and family or\nethnic ties to maneuver through complex and corrupt institutions.\nGloberman and Shapiro (2003) argue that the strength of governance infrastruc-\nture, such as the functioning of a range of formal institutions including property\nrights, regulation, transparency of information, and accountability, are important in\nattracting foreign direct investment (FDI) to developing and transition countries. By\ngovernance infrastructure, they mean attributes of legislation, regulation, and\ntransparency of government and legal processes that determine the security of property\nrights and transparency of government and legal processes. Numerous other papers have\nidentified the importance of national governance infrastructure for growth, investment,\nand new firm entry (e.g., Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson, 2001, Acemoglu,\nJohnson, and Robinson, 2002; Acemoglu, Johnson, Robinson, & Thaicharoen, 2003;\nAcemoglu & Robinson, 2000; Djankov, La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, & Shleifer, 2002;\nLa Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, & Vishny, 1999). These studies are largely based\non formal measures of institutions, for example the number of procedures necessary to\nstart a business, which are necessarily coarse as a consequence of the need for\ncomparability across more than 80 countries. Thus, while considerable insight has\nbeen derived from this approach, it tends to understate the role of informal institutions\nand the ways they interact with and may either improve or undermine formal\ninstitutions. Yet informal institutions are of especial significance in emerging\neconomies where the functioning of formal corporate governance institutions, such\nas corporate ownership rights or relations with external investors, are not transparent\nnor well-enforced. Aguilera, Filatotchev, Gospel, and Jackson (2008) recognize the\n42 S. Estrin, M. Prevezer\nneed, in order to understand the effects of corporate governance on the performance of\nfirms, to contextualize and specify the linkages in their open systems perspective\nbetween different aspects of the organizational environment. They do not include,\nhowever, specifically \u201cinformal institutions\u201d in their consideration of costs, contin-\ngencies, and complementarities. Peng and Heath (1996) emphasize the larger role that\ninformal constraints play in emerging economies where formal institutions are weak.\nPeng (2002) also recognizes the importance of the interaction between formal\nconstraints and informal constraints and their effects on organizations in the context of\nemerging economies in Asia.\nIn this paper, we develop a framework to model explicitly the ways in which\nformal and informal institutions interact and to highlight two aspects of institutions:\nwhether formal institutions are effective in what they claim to do; and whether the\ngoals of agents in the formal and informal institutions are compatible and mutually\nreinforcing or incompatible and in conflict with each other. We follow Helmke and\nLevitsky (2003) in placing informal institutions center-stage; these range from\nbureaucratic and legislative norms to various forms of clientelism or reliance on\nbusiness or familial networks rather than formal access to banks. In neglecting these\ninformal institutions, one risks ignoring many of the real incentives and constraints\nthat underlie the functioning of firms in emerging economies. We use the Helmke\nand Levitsky framework to classify the way in which informal institutions relating to\ncorporate governance function in China and India as compared with Russia and\nBrazil and to contrast the effects of these informal-formal institutional interactions\non corporate governance.\nThe main contribution of this paper is to provide a sharper theoretical\nframework, which has formerly been applied in the area of political science, to\neconomic theorizing on formal and informal institutions with specific theorizing\non how informal institutions work. It is a first step in the process of making the\nboundary between the formal and informal institutions theoretically and\nempirically sharper, to address the question of how the interactions of informal\nand formal institutions have been beneficial in some contexts and detrimental in\nothers. This paper provides a preliminary framework through which to address\nthis question. It provides an understanding in terms of the consistency between\nthe formal objectives of the governance institutions and how those institutions\noperate in practice.\nOur work provides a useful first step in organizing the disparate literature on\nformal and informal institutions, and clarifies some of the contrasting relationships\nfound in emerging economies as to how these institutions interact and affect\ngovernance. However we acknowledge that there are also some limitations to this\nframework. The first is that it is essentially static, and one needs to think about\nmechanisms to explain movements from one state to another. The second is that one\nneeds to build on the framework in order to make the hypotheses that arise from this\nanalysis empirically measurable. The third is the lack of clarity as to the level of\nanalysis which the framework should employ. However, our analysis leads us to\nbelieve that the framework nonetheless yields considerable insights and that these\nlimitations should therefore be regarded primarily as a stimulus for further research.\nTo that end, we revisit these issues at greater length in the concluding section,\nalongside how future work might address them.\nThe role of informal institutions in corporate governance 43\nIn The Helmke-Levitsky typology of informal institutions we outline the\nframework and classification of different types of informal institutions, before\ndiscussing Formal institutions of corporate governance. The role of informal\ninstitutions in corporate governance structures in the BRIC countries assesses the\neffectiveness of formal corporate governance institutions and examines the role of\ninformal institutions in corporate governance and contrasts their functioning between\nChina, India, Brazil, and Russia. Conclusions summarizes our findings on a grid that\nplaces the BRIC countries\u2019 institutions according to the role of their informal\ninstitutions in corporate governance. We go on to discuss how stable these positions\nare and the possible directions of movement following institutional reform.\nThe Helmke-Levitsky typology of informal institutions\nHelmke and Levitsky (2003) build on the ideas of Douglass North (1991) and\ndescribe informal institutions as \u201cthe actual rules that are being followed,\u201d unwritten\nrules that often shape incentives in systematic ways. Informal rules have long been\nof interest but have not been rigorously conceptualized or theorized into mainstream\nstudies of institutions which have focused rather on the formal rules of the game.\nFormal institutions refer to state bodies such as courts, legislatures, bureaucracies,\nand state-enforced rules such as constitutions, laws, and regulations. They are openly\ncodified in that they are established and known through official channels. Informal\ninstitutions are usually unwritten and are created and enforced outside the official\nchannels.\nThey argue that informal institutions can work either positively or negatively to\nboost or constrain formal institutions. For example in the sphere of political science,\ninformal institutions may limit presidential power; despite Chile\u2019s 1980 Constitution\ncreating one of the most powerful presidencies in the world, in practice Chilean\npresidents have been constrained by a complex network of informal institutions that\npush for executive consultation and power-sharing. Informal devices in Costa Rica\nlead legislators to perform constituency services that parties need for electoral\ncampaigns. Informal institutions can also undermine formal regimes: clan networks\nand politics in the Kyrgyz Republic and Uzbekistan subverted formal institutions in\nthe post-Soviet era after 1990 such that \u201cinformal mechanisms of network-controlled\nexchange and norms \u2026 became the rules of the game.\u201d We are therefore grouping\nunder informal institutions a variety of structures which have significance in the\neconomy but whose power does not stem from de jure rights.\nThe focus of the Helmke-Levitsky framework is on the interaction between\nformal and informal institutions. There are two strands of the literature. In the first,\ninformal institutions have a problem-solving role in assisting social interaction and\ncoordination and improving the efficiency or performance of complex formal\ninstitutions. In the other, informal institutions have a problem-creating role, for\nexample via corruption, clientelism, or clan politics that undermine markets, states,\nand democratic regimes. Peng (2001) stresses the role of institutional frameworks\nrather than national cultures and specifically the positive role of market-supporting\ninstitutions, both formal and informal, in giving rise to entrepreneurship in China.\nMorck (2005), Morck and Steier (2005), and Steier (2009) highlight the rent-seeking\n44 S. Estrin, M. Prevezer\nbehavior and stifling of new entrants that can occur when large family business\ngroups entrench themselves, particularly in emerging economies.\nHelmke-Levitsky provides a systematic framework to model how under certain\nconditions informal institutions will reinforce failing formal institutions whereas under\nothers informal institutions will undermine formal institutions. They identify four distinct\ntypes of informal institutions in terms of the way they interact with the formal:\ncomplementary, accommodating, competing, and substitutive. This typology is based on\ntwo characteristics. The first is the effectiveness of formal institutions, with two aspects:\nwhether there are laws and codes of governance which exist de jure and are market-\nsupporting and whether these de jure laws and codes of conduct are enforced. If, due to\njudicial inefficiency or corruption, formal rights are not matched by enforcement, then\nthose formal institutions are said to be ineffective. Informal institutions can operate in a\ncontext of effective formal institutions where good rules exist and are enforced, or\ninformal institutions can work in a context of non-existence of clear rules or rules which\nare not enforced. Only when legal rights on paper are matched by de facto enforcement,\nwhich can come about through formal or informal institutional means, can we argue that\nthose formal institutions are effective.\nThe second characteristic of informal institutions concerns the degree of compatibility\nbetween the goals of the actors relevant to formal and informal institutions. Goals are\ncompatible at a particular level of analysis if the aims of the formal laws and the agents\nworking within informal institutions\u2014be they business groups, familial networks, the\nstate through the local party, bureaucratic elites\u2014are working towards the same ends, for\nexample, the financing of companies or the reinforcement of corporate ownership rights.\nIncompatible goals means that the aims of formal and informal agents at that level of\nanalysis are hostile or, more weakly, are not mutually reinforcing. To give an example,\nwhere shareholder rights are contested by the state or where minority investor rights are\nthreatened by expropriation, the goals of investors or shareholders are pitted against those\nagents in informal institutions such as the state or local party or oligarchic shareholder\nwhich are threatening expropriation.\nThe Helmke-Levitsky typology of informal institutions is shown in Table 1 where\ncomplementary informal institutions are defined by having a context of effective\nformal institutions and compatible goals between formal and informal. Informal\ninstitutions fill in the gaps left by formal institutions, are compatible and\ncomplementary to them, and assist them in functioning more effectively; they\naddress problems not dealt with by formal rules yet without violating them. Hence\nthey tend to enhance the performance or efficacy of the formal institutions. Helmke\nTable 1 Typology of informal institutions.\nIneffective formal\ninstitutions\nEffective formal\ninstitutions\nCompatible goals between actors in formal and\ninformal institutions\nSubstitutive Complementary\nConflicting goals between actors in formal\nand informal institutions\nCompeting Accommodating\nHelmke and Levitsky (2003).\nThe role of informal institutions in corporate governance 45\nand Levitsky give examples of such complementary informal institutions in the\nvariety of norms and routines that allow bureaucracies to function efficiently such as\nthe folkways of the US Senate. They are most commonly found in OECD countries\nwhere formal institutions function effectively. This is in some ways similar to the\n\u201cVarieties of Asian Capitalism\u201d literature (Carney, Gedajlovic, & Yang, 2009a)\nwhich discusses institutional complementarities depending on the extent to which\ninstitutions (in several sectors) are compatible with one another. Liberal market\neconomies and coordinated market economies are characterized as having high\nlevels of complementarity with mutually supportive interconnected institutions. In\ncontrast, hybridized or mixed models of capitalism, such as more nearly describe\nthose in emerging economies in Asia, have non-cohesive institutions that work\nagainst one another.\nAccommodating informal institutions arise in situations where formal institutions\nare effective but the goals of formal and informal actors are in conflict. Such\ninformal institutions act to reconcile the interests of the key actors with the formal\narrangements, getting around formal rules when they are not in line with the aims of\nall actors. Thus, they violate the spirit rather than the letter of formal rules and\nprovide a second-best solution where the rules cannot be challenged directly. They\ndo not necessarily enhance performance but they can create stability and enable the\nfunctioning of the formal institutions. Examples might include the operation of a\nlarge scale shadow economy in countries with a well-developed property rights\nsystems but also high levels of business taxation and regulation.\nSubstitutive informal institutions occur where formal institutions are ineffective\nbut goals between formal and informal are compatible. Thus they subvert the formal\nrules and there is connivance between actors in formal and informal institutions in\ngetting around what are commonly perceived to be inadequate or inappropriate\nformal institutions providing alternative methods of institutional functioning. In\ndoing so, they can improve performance and create vested interests in those\nsubstitutive informal institutions. Again parallels can be drawn with the \u201cVarieties of\nCapitalism\u201d literature; Carney and colleagues (2009a), Carney, Shapiro, and Tang\n(2009b) argue that the organization of firms into business groups in many Asian\ncountries is due to the absence of formal institutions that can assure business\ntransactions; business groups trading repeatedly with one another establish quasi\nmarkets for capital, talent, technology, and other resources that are costly or\ninaccessible through market contracting. These groups are acting as substitutes for\nmarket institutions and their actions fill these institutional voids.\nCompeting informal institutions exist where there are ineffective formal institutions\nand conflicting goals between formal and informal actors. Here the informal institutions\nactually challenge formal institutional structures; those acting through informal\ninstitutions have differing goals from the actors within the formal institutions. These\nkinds of informal institutions can include corruption networks such as mafias,\nclientelism, or various forms of clan-like networks, arbitrary inspection teams which\ncan extort rents and work on a differently functioning system of power and incentives\nfrom those actors operating within formal institutional frameworks. In doing so they can\nundermine those formal institutions and could tend to diminish or reduce measures of\nperformance such as entry of new firms or levels of FDI, measures which rely on a level\nplaying field between incumbent firms and new firms or between domestic\n46 S. Estrin, M. Prevezer\nentrepreneurship and foreign entrepreneurship. Carney and colleagues (2009a, b) and\nSteier (2009) also point to the scenarios of oligarchic capitalism where business\ngroups may become so large and powerful within their national economies that they\ninhibit the ability of new firms to form or independent firms to grow. This would\nconstitute an example where the informal institution of the business group is replacing\nthe ineffective formal institution (capital markets which are insufficiently developed to\ngive firms access to finance) but where the goals of the large and powerful business\ngroups are incompatible with the formal institutional goals of providing access to all\nfirms, small as well as large and new as well as incumbent ones. Steier (2009)\ncontrasts the characteristics of an oligarchies-dominated system, with little entrepre-\nneurship, wealth preservation, and rent-seeking and the perpetuation of weak\ninstitutions, with an entrepreneurial-dominated system where business groups act for\nwealth creation and where institutional voids are bridged by such groups and the\ninstitutional environment is developing. As Steier (2009: 531) says, \u201cwhether familial\ncapitalism contributes to or inhibits the prosperity of an economy depends largely on\nthe institutional context,\u201d and \u201cwe need to develop better theories of how\norganizations, institutions and economies co-evolve.\u201d\nIdentifying relevant informal institutions in the BRIC countries\nThe informal institutions that we identify as relevant to our discussion of the\nfunctioning of corporate governance institutions are specific to each country and are\nidentified from the literatures on the histories and legacies of each country. A strong\ncomponent of the story is that the interactions between formal and informal\ninstitutions in the economic sphere are path dependent, arising out of the modes of\ndevelopment that are characteristic of that country.\nIn China, we focus on the role that the state plays in legitimizing private property\nand entrepreneurship in the absence of effective formal legal rights as a key informal\ninstitution. This heralds back to Sachs and Woo (1994), who contrast the paths of\nreform in China and Russia emphasizing the very different starting points when\ntransition from planning occurred. Specifically, Chinese liberalization was a process\nthat continually involved the local state. Property ownership involved quasi-\ncontracts with the state to deliver a negotiated amount of taxes, leaving incentives\nto produce more which could be retained by the enterprise. The reforms were not\nconceived as an integrated strategy to create a market, still less a capitalist economy,\nat best perhaps a socialist market economy from 1992. The formal legal institutions\nwere not therefore conceived or designed as those to support a capitalist market\neconomy. Nevertheless the process of gradual reform (Laffont & Qian, 1999) placed\nemphasis on engineering an accommodation to reform, to reduce constraints to\nenterprise, and to reinforce the market processes without formally having to forego\nthe political ideology of state control.\nIn Russia, the informal institution that is central to the operation of governance, as\nin other workings of the economy, is the tradition of \u201cblat\u201d (Andvig, 2006; Ellman,\n1978; Ledeneva, 1996), with its elaborate code of gift-giving and obligation, sliding\ninto corruption. In practice, this has so far proved more continuous and stronger than\nthe institutions of the more formal market-based governance arrangements. It is\nargued (Sachs & Woo, 1994) that in part this has to do with the more deeply\nThe role of informal institutions in corporate governance 47\nentrenched roots of the planning economy in Russia than in China and therefore of\nways of dealing with its constraints. The blat system has endured well beyond the\ncollapse of the Soviet system and it is on this that we focus below.\nIn Brazil, the shadow (informal) institution that we identify is the operation of\nthe informal economy. This emerges out of the analyses following de Soto and\nLlosa (1989) that stresses the response to the \u201cbureaucratized and law-ridden state\u201d\nin Latin America through the informal institution of the shadow economy which\nworks around formal rules in a parallel economy that is freer and unregulated. We\nfollow this literature in looking specifically at how the informal economy operates\nin the realm of corporate governance in its interaction with formal governance\ninstitutions.\nFinally, for India, the key informal institution that we have identified again is\nidentified from the literature in which informal institutions are most significant. In\nIndia\u2019s case, the role of business groups in economic and business development has\nbeen particularly highlighted (Carney, 2008; Douma, George, & Kabir, 2006;\nKhanna & Palepu, 2000), historically arising when licensing and state restrictions\nwere the norm (Shiba & Masahiro, 1997). The role of diversified (conglomerate)\nbusiness groups, usually family owned and closely held, is a persistent characteristic\nof Indian growth (Chacar & Vissa, 2005).\nFormal institutions of corporate governance\nShleifer and Vishny (1997), in their survey of corporate governance, propose the\nmain issues for corporate governance in emerging economies to be: (1) the nature of\nlegal protection for investors, particularly small minority investors where they exist,\nand (2) the concentrated ownership of firms and the presence of large investors in\nfirms that are the norm for developing country ownership structures and the\nconsequences of concentrated ownership and influence of large investors. As\nBroadman (1999) argues, we need a broader prism to assess control and corporate\ngovernance in emerging economies than simply the relationship between providers\nof equity capital and those running firms; the Berle and Means (1932) model of\nentrenched management and weak dispersed shareholders is not the issue. In\nemerging economies there is frequently concentrated ownership and a dominant\nshareholder, be they an individual, family, institutional investor, or a bank. The\nproblem for closely held firms is not one of shareholder protection and boards of\ndirectors but of cross-shareholdings, holding companies, and pyramid mechanisms\nwhich the dominant shareholders use to exercise control, namely the principal-\nprincipal issue, (Young, Peng, Ahlstrom, Bruton, & Jiang, 2008). In other words the\ndominant shareholder is often over-powerful and exploits the other stakeholders in\nthe firm. Broadman (1999) has termed this for Russia \u201cunchecked insider control\u201d in\na corporate governance vacuum without well-protected property rights. The related\nproblem of insider control is that of transparency of information\u2014it is often highly\nunclear who are the ultimate owners of, for instance, Russian corporate shares in the\nrise of the closely held firm. This is true also for China. As Peng (2002) points out,\nfirm boundaries in many Asian economies (as well as in Russia) are often blurred by\nthe existence of large conglomerates, permeated by personal connections, partial\n48 S. Estrin, M. Prevezer\nownerships, and board interlocks. The ownership patterns of such business groups\nare therefore more opaque than in Western firms.\nThe BRIC countries, as most emerging economies, are characterized by corporate\ngovernance structures with high concentration of ownership and inside investors (Gerlach,\n1992; Heugens, van Essen, & van Oosterhout, 2009). The consequences of the potential\nprincipal-principal problems that follow from concentrated ownership depend largely on\nthe way the key institutions, formal and informal, in the country work. In particular, as\ndiscussed above, the formal legal protection of minority shareholders is critical in\nprotecting against self-dealing by dominant shareholder-executives. It is also a question\nof the extent, in practice, that the country\u2019s institutions allow dominant shareholders to\nextract benefits from the firms that they own and control. As Heugens and colleagues\n(2009) argue, there are three ways that inside investors who combine a substantial\nownership stake with direct managerial control over a company might adversely affect\nfirm performance. They might be more risk averse than more diversified investors and\nhence less profit-generating; they might appoint family members whom they trust or can\nexert influence over rather than outsiders with more managerial experience and talent;\nand they may exploit minority shareholders by tunneling funds out of the corporation.\nThe quality of a country\u2019s institutions, formal and informal, will affect the extent to\nwhich these problems occur; both the formal legal protection of minority shareholders\nand also the extent to which dominant shareholders are able to extract benefits from the\nfirm in practice.\nThe Helmke-Levitsky framework can be applied at the level of particular institutions\nand agents within those institutions. When analyzing ownership structures of firms, the\nappropriate level of analysis is the security of property rights for those owners in each\nparticular country, for example owners of firms in the context of an Indian family-held\nbusiness group, or a Russian financial-industrial group, or a Chinese formerly state-\nowned firm. When looking at the assurance of returns to investors and its interplay with\naccess to finance, the appropriate level of analysis is that of the firms themselves and the\ninstitutional mechanisms that are available to ensure those returns and thereby to raise\ncapital. In other words, how do capital markets and banks operate in each country, which\nkinds of firms have access to them, what are the alternative informal institutions that\nfunction to provide such finance, and what is their relationship to the formal institutions,\nas looked at from the perspective of those firms in each country. In each case, we specify\nwho those agents are, how the goals of agents in the specific formal and informal\ninstitutions are compatible or incompatible, and whether the formal institutions are\neffective or ineffective in relation to the goals of those formal institutions. We find some\nbut not complete consistency within countries in terms of the way informal and formal\ninstitutions interact.\nFormal corporate governance structures in BRIC countries\nChina\u2019s formal legal corporate governance structures are ineffective as market-\nsupporting institutions in several ways. In fact, private ownership of property only\nbecame legally permissible relatively recently: In 1977 private firms were illegal and\nnegligible in numbers, by 2005 there were 29.3 million private businesses, employing\nover 200 million people and accounting for almost 50% of GDP (China Daily, 2005, in\nTsai, 2006). This is despite the fact that property rights in China were not formally\nThe role of informal institutions in corporate governance 49\nrecognized until 2004 and legal independence of the judiciary has been poor (New\nYork Times, 2005). There is a lack of legal infrastructure, shaky intellectual property\nrights (IPR), and weak contract enforcement (Cao, 2004). There also remains\nconsiderable state ownership of privately listed companies and the state or its agents\ncarry out shareholder functions which would otherwise be performed by private\nowners in market economies (Estrin & Tian, 2008; Tian & Lau, 2001). There are\nvarious studies of the state\u2019s incapability as a shareholder (Broadman, 1999; Chen,\n1997) Corporate governance codes do not conform to those of the West in a variety of\nways: there is frequent CEO-chairman duality with no independent chairman of\nboards of directors and directors on boards tend to be affiliated and not independent of\nmanagement. Overall, formal ownership governance structures are not particularly\nconducive to effective corporate governance (see Table 2).\nIndia\u2019s formal corporate governance institutions were very poor post-independence but\nhave improved somewhat since the 1991 liberalization: capital markets have been\nliberalized, a takeover code adopted in 1994 paving the way for a rudimentary market in\ncorporate control, and steps have been taken to improve corporate governance norms and\ndisclosure practices. Foreign capital has increased (see Goldman Sachs, 2003). Following\nLa Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny (1998), we can classify India\naccording to its formal codes of legal\/regulatory institutions and different levels of\ninvestor protection; these are formal measures of investor protection (Table 2). We can\nconclude that India\u2019s formal shareholder and creditor rights are relatively well\nformulated within a well-established legal framework.\nHowever, as noted above, a distinctive feature is the prevalence of conglomerate\nbusiness groups entailing common ownership and management by family members;\nfirms are separate legal entities, listed separately with their own set of shareholders, but\nthe family controls the strategic direction and regulates firm transfers (Douma et al.,\n2006). It has been widely argued that business groups have filled institutional voids\nsuch as imperfections in markets for capital, products, and managerial talent (Khanna\n& Palepu, 2000). Peng and Jiang (2006) provide evidence that concentrated ownership\nis beneficial for firm performance in cases where there are weaker or less developed\nlegal and regulatory institutions to protect shareholders.\nTable 2 Formal shareholder rights and creditor rights.\nShareholder rights Creditor rights\nIndex Index\nIndia 5 4\nBrazil 3 1\nUS 5 1\nAverage across sample 3 2.3\nChina Lowa Lowa\nRussia Higha Higha\nLa Porta and colleagues (1998).\na Author estimation (Estrin & Prevezer, 2010).\n50 S. Estrin, M. Prevezer\nMoreover, India has marked differences between regions. Although national legal\nstructures and policies apply in all states, there are marked variations in the\nimplementation of the legal system at the state level. Thus high-performing states\nsuch as Gujarat or Maharashtra have 8% per annum growth rates in state GDP\ncompared with 4% per annum and lower rates in Bihar or Orissa. In poorly-\nperforming states, security of property, ownership rights, and enforcement of the rule\nof law are poor and formal legal codes are ineffective.\nRussian laws on corporate governance and property rights were constructed from\nscratch in the late 1980s. Puffer and McCarthy (2003) list the laws affecting corporate\ngovernance including the legalization of private companies (1986), through to the\n1991 Law on Property and 1992 Law on Privatization of State Enterprises, the 1996\nJoint Stock Company Law strengthening shareholder rights, the 1996 Law on the\nSecurities Market strengthening corporate governance including the protection of\nminority shareholders and the separate roles for the CEO and Chairman. However,\nserious issues remained in practice because of lax enforcement and failure to protect\nminority shareholder rights, creditor rights, and the balance between debtors and\ncreditors in bankruptcy hearings, plus a lack of transparency in bankruptcy and\ncompany law (Puffer & McCarthy, 2003). A new Russian Bankruptcy Law was\nintroduced in 1998. Reforms in 2000 led to improvement in transparency and the\nimplementation of international accounting standards for many firms, and competition\nlaw in 2002 strengthened norms and rules governing contracts (McCarthy, Puffer, &\nNaumov, 2000). The independence of the judiciary was strengthened through a law of\n2001 on the status of judges removing judicial appointments from control by regional\nlegislatures, and there was a new Criminal Procedure Code of 2002 increasing the\npower of judges. The security of property rights was scrutinized by parliament in 2003\nand minority shareholder rights were strengthened in 2004 (Granville & Leonard,\n2007). The Russian Federation is now classified as a \u201chigh compliance country\u201d in\nterms of level of compliance with international standards for corporate governance,\nindicating a sound legal framework in line with OECD principles (EBRD, 2005). As\nTable 2 shows, formal institutions for corporate governance in Russia can now be\nregarded as good.\nIn Brazil, formal corporate governance structures have improved markedly since\n2000 (Lubrano, 2007). The negative consequences of poor governance (noted in\nTable 2) were apparent with considerable legal uncertainty and an overhang of non-\nvoting shares and poor company performance. There was a legal reform initiative, a\nWorld Bank and IFC study, and an Investor Task Force in 2000. Since then there have\nbeen some milestones: an OECD Roundtable launch, a companies\/investors meeting,\nand the launch of the Novo Mercado all in 2000, approval of legal reforms in 2001,\nthe taking off of the Novo Mercado in 2004, an International Corporate Governance\nmeeting in 2004, a Banco Real Corporate Governance Credit Line also in 2004, a\nCompanies Circle in 2005, and the 100th Novo Mercado listing in 2007. By 2007\nthere were demonstrable consequences of improved corporate governance: most new\nshares now go out on the Novo Mercado and there is greater legal certainty in changes\nof control but some obstacles to takeovers. There are public and private sector\nchampions for good governance and leadership in most elements of the private sector\namong companies and investors. The legal framework including enforcement\ninfrastructure is in place and there is also the private infrastructure in terms of\nThe role of informal institutions in corporate governance 51\neducation and monitoring; more recent offerings by restructured firms would not have\nbeen possible without these reforms (Lubrano, 2007).\nFormal institutions for external investment\nAccess to equity markets is relatively low across all the BRIC countries, with a greater\nreliance on internal funds and insider investment than on external investors. Reliance on\nequity markets is particularly low in Brazil at around 3\u20134% of firms compared with 12\u2013\n16% of firms in India and China, and access to long-term finance through international\ncapital markets is restricted to larger firms. This is the consequence of the\nunderdeveloped nature of capital markets as much as poor governance structures.\nThe greatest sources of external finance are from banks through overdraft facilities or\nbank loans, with much greater access for larger firms than small- to medium-sized\nenterprises (SMEs). In Brazil in particular, terms are more severe for SMEs with low\nvolumes of credit given, higher interest rates, and high default rates and terms are more\nfavorable to incumbent, established firms in older industries than newly created firms\n(Campos & Iootty, 2007). More than half of Brazilian firms that need loans do not\napply, according to a World Bank (2003a, b, c) report because of the complex\nrequirements, compared with a figure of 32% for China and 16% for India. The\nproblem is particularly severe for micro firms where the Brazilian level is three times\nthat of Chinese or Indian firms (see Appendix Table A1).\nIn China, state-owned firms have preferential access to finance from state-owned\nbanks compared with private firms; there are severe restrictions to bank loans for certain\ntypes of businesses, especially privately owned and riskier enterprises. In India, the\nposition is more favorable for smaller firms, with over half of small businesses having\nactive bank credit lines or overdraft facilities and a lower reliance on retained earnings\nthan in China or Brazil. Russia\u2019s position on formal access to finance is poor. Russian\ncompanies in the early 2000s obtained only 3\u20135% of capital from banks, compared with\n15\u201330% in more advanced market-based countries. The reason is that banks controlled\nvery little of the country\u2019s banking deposits, with Alfa Bank for example holding only\n2\u20133% of Russia\u2019s ruble deposits. Sberbank, owned by the Central Bank, controlled 72%\nof the country\u2019s ruble deposits in 2002 and favored larger and state-owned firms (Puffer\n& McCarthy, 2003). Use of external finance for SMEs is low: the OPORA survey of\nSMEs stated that only 16% of small businesses across Russia use bank loans\n(OPORA, 2005). Formal external investor rights in the BRIC countries are therefore\nweaker than in the West because of less reliance on external investment. This in turn is\ndue to the historical legacy of state-owned banks which do not themselves have a\nmarket-supporting legacy as institutions.\nThe role of informal institutions in corporate governance structures\nin the BRIC countries\nThis paper develops a framework to analyze consequences of the fact that informal\ninstitutions play a greater role in corporate governance in emerging economies than in\nOECD economies (Peng & Heath, 1996). This role is ambiguous however: informal\ninstitutions can improve the functioning of corporate governance or they can undermine\n52 S. Estrin, M. Prevezer\nthe formal corporate governance institutions, and we see both patterns across the BRIC\neconomies. In contrast, the bulk of informal institutions are probably usually\ncomplementary in most OECD economies.\nWe will argue below that in China and India, the informal institutions for\ncorporate governance are largely substitutive in that they compensate for ineffective\nformal corporate governance institutions but the goals are not in conflict with those\nof the formal institutions. However, Russia has competing informal institutions for\ncorporate governance in that the effectiveness of the formal institutions is\nundermined through corruption and lack of enforcement and the goals of the agents\nin informal institutions conflict with the goals of formal institutions. Interestingly\nBrazil has accommodating informal institutions for corporate governance in that the\neffectiveness of the formal institutions is largely good, but informal institutions have\ndifferent goals from the formal institutions and are used to get around what are seen\nto be overly restrictive formal institutions.\nIn terms of overall effectiveness of their formal corporate governance institutions,\nwe see, in Table 3, a distinction between India, China, and Russia where\neffectiveness is low due to weak rule of law, poor enforcement, and high corruption,\nand Brazil where effectiveness overall is high, apart from the inefficiency of its\njudiciary, with a strong rule of law, strict enforcement, medium levels of corruption,\nand a low risk of expropriation.\nChina\nA favorable environment for firms and creating supportive goals between owners and\nlocal states and government officials (Ahlstrom, Bruton, & Yeh, 2008) has been\nconstructed in China via informal institutions in a variety of ways. The informal\ninstitutions that compensate for unclear corporate ownership and rights of investors are\nthose that build the legitimacy of private firms in the face of uncertain legal rights\n(Ahlstrom et al., 2008). As Ahlstrom and colleagues quote \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to keep the\n[Chinese] Government from taking those private assets back \u2026 One year things are\nopen and everyone can prosper; the next year the Government decides to collect\neverything for the state\u201d Cao Si-yuan, senior adviser to former People\u2019s Republic of\nChina General Secretary Zhao Ziyang. The perceived governance danger in China is\nTable 3 How effective are formal corporate governance institutions.\nEnforcement measures Judiciary Rule of law Corruption Risk of expropriation\nIndia 8 4.17 4.58 7.75\nBrazil 5.75 6.32 6.32 7.62\nChina weaka weaka poora lowa\nRussia weaka weaka poora higha\nUS 10 10 8.63 9.98\nAverage of sample 7.67 6.85 6.90 8.05\nLa Porta and colleagues (1998).\na Author estimation (Estrin & Prevezer, 2010).\nThe role of informal institutions in corporate governance 53\ntherefore not misappropriation or tunneling by concentrated owners vis \u00e1 vis minority\nshareholders (although this may be an issue). Instead it is establishing private ownership\nrights as against the state, where the default position is that the state may assume\nownership and control of all assets. For instance, many private businesses in China were\nfounded before it was legal to possess private property, or when it was legal but bypassed\nmany of the bureaucratic regulations for such businesses, combining state and private\nassets. The owners of private companies fear that the government might challenge their\nright to exist and appropriate assets. In the light of this, Ahlstrom and colleagues (2008)\nemphasize the various types of informal institutions that are used to establish legitimacy\nand to protect the firm in the light of unclear or ineffective formal institutions. These\ninclude cultivating relations with government officials, taking over ailing state-owned\nenterprises, donating services to the local community, and concealing the private nature\nof ownership (Ahlstrom et al., 2008).\nTipton (2009) argues that the Chinese state since the 1980s has the attributes of\nfairly high state direction (although lower than in the earlier period) alongside low\nstate capacity and the ability to enforce the legal regime. According to Wang\nHongying (2000) Chinese legal institutions have been either ineffective or irrelevant.\nPrivate ownership of companies has only relatively recently been made legal and has\nremained politically less favored than state or collective ownership and there remain\nambiguities in enforcement of private ownership rights, which are susceptible to\ngovernment intervention and expropriation. As Heugens and colleagues (2009)\nargue, China combines a situation of weak ownership protection and weak rule of\nlaw, in which concentrated ownership ceases to substitute and be an effective\ncorporate governance strategy.\nHowever, informal institutions can neutralize or compensate for these weaknesses in\nshareholder protection and rule of law. Tsai (2006) emphasizes \u201cadaptive informal\ninstitutions and endogenous institutional change in China\u201d in the area of private\nownership of companies. Informal interactions between the local state and private\nentrepreneurs have underpinned and legitimized formal institutional reforms in favor of\nprivate property rights. The formal institution of state ownership has remained in place\nin many cases while the substantive role has changed dramatically. There has been\n\u201cinstitutional conversion\u201d where actors \u201cquietly appropriate formal institutions to serve\ntheir own ends\u201d (Tsai, 2006) when there is a gap between the original intentions of the\nformal institutions and the aims of local actors. This institutional adaptation or\nconversion can only occur when there is a convergence of aims and incentives between\nthe enforcers of formal institutions and the creators of informal adaptations, in this case\nthe local state and private owners of companies. Both local state and private owners\nmutually benefit from arrangements that transgress the formal institutional rules, and\nhave ignored or not enforced those rules, creating substitutive institutions of private\ncompany ownership. For example, this has been done through disguising private\nownership\u2014wearing a red hat (dai hongmaozi)\u2014where a business is registered as a\ncollective enterprise whereas in practice it is privately owned and managed; or\nregistering a private enterprise as an appendage to a state-owned one, a so called hang-\non enterprises (guahu qiye). Red hat enterprises were particularly prevalent in the first\ndecade of reform when privately-owned enterprises with more than eight employees\nwere illegal. In many localities over 90% of collective enterprises were privately-owned\nbut with disguises of red hats. Local party officials have been complicit in sanctioning\n54 S. Estrin, M. Prevezer\nthis arrangement. In the Eastern provinces of Fujian and Zhejiang, large numbers of\nprivate firms were registered as collectives to avoid stifling regulations and have\nremained registered as such (Huang, 2005; Wank, 1996), whereas in Guangdong\nprovince, with its longer acceptance of private enterprise, these concealment strategies\nhave not been so necessary.\nFormal regulation of private enterprise has adapted to these informal arrange-\nments by legalizing their existence. From 2001, private entrepreneurs were invited to\njoin the Chinese Communist Party. However, Party members continued to use the\ndisguise of wearing a red hat as there remained political criticism of private\nentrepreneurs\u2019 \u201cspiritual pollution\u201d and \u201cbourgeois liberalization\u201d and harassment by\ntax collectors and bureaucrats. Tsai (2006) gives an example of a furniture\nmanufacturer in Hebei province that had run a state-owned enterprise as a\nCommunist Party member for 12 years; he set up his own business in 1991 under\nthe disguise of a red hat, registering it as a collective enterprise. He continued in the\nlocal People\u2019s Congress and was heralded as an \u201cupstanding red capitalist.\u201d\nOther strategies that firms have taken to build the legitimacy of their private enterprise\ninclude choosing geographical localities where it is known that private enterprise is more\nacceptable; by taking over ailing state-owned enterprises especially in poorer regions of\nthe country in order to gain approval from both the provincial government and from the\ncentral government; through using very long-standing relations or clan ties which confer\nlegitimacy; through reciprocal relation-building including giving gifts and holding\nreceptions (Peng & Luo, 2000); allying with foreign firms whose legitimacy was\nalready accepted and whose presence was welcomed; through establishing guanxi with\nlocal officials, party cadres, village committees, and the judiciary (Ahlstrom et al.,\n2008). For example, visits by senior government officials have been seen as conferring\napproval and have lead to preferential terms for bank loans and government support.\nIn terms of relationships between investors more generally and the firm, Chinese\ncapital markets are under-developed and banks continue to be state-owned and\ndominated by local state funding priorities. Chinese family-owned firms rely heavily\non informal sources of finance such as family networks (Appendix Table A1),\nparticularly small private firms with lack of access to bank finance. Entrepreneurs go\nto unofficial and illegal credit institutions, not qualifying for credit from state-owned\nbanks which favor strategically important firms at the expense of SMEs. Private\ncredit and underground credit institutions have flourished, relying on personal\nconnections and reputation and SMEs have to borrow from such illegal institutions\nat very high rates (Tian, 2007). Again these informal institutions are countenanced\nofficially and are seen not to conflict with the aims of formal legal institutions.\nIndia\nIn India, despite shareholder and creditor rights formally having been well set up, there are\nissues in terms of how effectively these rights are enforced. We noted that in part this is a\nregional issue, with some states having effective legal rights and in others (such as Bihar)\nthe rule of law not being well established. Overall, as Table 3 shows, in terms of\neffectiveness, India fares poorly on the rule of law and corruption indices compared with\nthe average in the sample, although the efficiency of the judiciary is good and the risk of\nexpropriation is low. Lee and Oh (2007) distinguish between the pervasiveness and\nThe role of informal institutions in corporate governance 55\narbitrariness of corruption, arguing that pervasive corruption without arbitrariness does\nnot detract from growth and investment, in that it is predictable and can be built into\nfirms\u2019 calculations of cost. Arbitrary corruption on the other hand, even with fairly low\nlevels of pervasiveness, is off-putting to investors, especially foreign investors, in that its\nuncertainty and unpredictability make dealings more hazardous. They place China and\nIndia as both having pervasive corruption, but India having arbitrary corruption in\naddition, which would tend to undermine formal institutions and place greater onus on\nthe role of the informal institutions in the governance of firms.\nIn India, we would argue that the most important informal institutions, to interact with\nthese formal governance institutions, are those associated with business groups. We\ndiscussed above the extensive ownership and control of firms by families and business\ngroups in many Asian countries, including India. The issue for this paper concerns what\nrole these groups play\u2014do they fill an institutional void by giving access to resources\nthrough informal, private networks, or do family-controlled firms discriminate against\noutside shareholders, have more difficult agency conflicts within the family, and lead to\nworse performance of firms from the point of view of shareholders? Douma and\ncolleagues (2006) find positive effects on performance of concentrated corporate\nownership by foreign and domestic corporations (as distinct from foreign or domestic\nfinancial institutions), in particular when affiliated to a business group. Peng and Jiang\n(2006) find that the net balance of benefits and costs of family ownership and control in\nlarge firms depends on the legal and regulatory institutions for investor protection: that\nhigh family ownership concentration is beneficial when formal legal institutions are\nweak. Heugens and colleagues (2009) supports this finding\u2014that when there is less\nthan perfect legal protection of minority shareholders, ownership concentration is an\nefficient corporate governance strategy. But they also find that a certain threshold level\nof institutional development is necessary to make concentrated ownership effective.\nWhere owners can extract private benefits from the corporations they control, then such\nconcentration is not beneficial to firm performance.\nLi, Ramaswamy, and P\u00e9cherot Petitt (2006) argue that the business group\nstructure is a horizontal strategy of diversification that is particularly suited for\ndealing with the market failures associated with failures in capital markets and in the\nmanagerial labor market. Capital markets in India fail because they are weak and\nshallow and limit any company\u2019s potential to obtain money to fuel expansion and\ngrowth (Khanna & Palepu, 2005; Khanna & Yafeh, 2005). In most emerging\neconomies, equity is a small part of capital raised and access to debt capital is\ncontrolled by a handful of banks which act according to government priorities in the\nindustrial sector. Usually access to foreign capital is relatively limited as well, due to\nweak governance norms (Li et al., 2006). Large business groups overcome financing\nobstacles, creating an internal capital market and enabling the different firms within\nit to compete for funds.\nThis summary of the literature as well as our cases (Estrin & Prevezer, 2010) lead\nus to conclude that the informal institutions of corporate governance in India are\nsubstitutive\u2014that they replace the largely ineffective formal legal framework and\ncapital markets but have non-conflicting aims or goals with those of formal\ninstitutions. This applies mainly in those states where the rule of law, crime, and\ncorruption are not so arbitrary as to create conflicting goals between the business\ngroups and the formal legal framework.\n56 S. Estrin, M. Prevezer\nRussia\nAlthough Russia\u2019s formal corporate governance codes on paper are comparable to OECD\nstandards, its formal institutions are ineffective due to lack of enforcement and a gap\nbetween the \u201cvirtual economy\u201d (Maddy & Ickes, 1998) reflected in official statistics and\ncompany reports and reality. In practice, the concentrated financial industrial groups\n(FIGs) owned by so-called \u201coligarchs\u201d (Estrin, Poukiakova, & Shapiro, 2009) have been\nrent-seeking and stifling of entrepreneurship (Aidis, Estrin, & Mickiewicz, 2008) and\nhave conflicting aims with the formal rules of the legal framework and institutions.\nAs Heugens and colleagues (2009) argue, for ownership concentration to be\nbeneficial for the performance of firms, there needs to be a certain degree of institutional\ndevelopment as measured by the rule of law in the absence of strong legal protection of\nminority shareholders. In the case of Russia, the formal rule of law and protection of\nminority shareholders is undermined by lack of enforcement and arbitrary corruption.\nThe identity of the concentrated shareholder also matters; Heugens and colleagues\n(2009) distinguish between market (arm\u2019s-length) investors, stable investors such as\naffiliated firms or banks with multiple ties to the firm, and inside investors who combine\nconcentrated ownership with managerial control. They find that different kinds of\nconcentrated owners have different effects on performance. If there are strong formal\ninstitutions in the form of effective rule of law, then even if there is low protection for\nminority investors, there is a spread of returns between market and other investors as\nmarket investors can nevertheless rely on recourse to the courts to enforce their rights\nagainst tunneling. This is not the case in Russia, with insider investors, ineffective rule\nof law, and a weak judiciary. It is argued that even with a clear legal claim, there is a\ndanger of losing assets through the corruption of the judicial system and administration.\nThe Yukos affair illustrated the selectiveness of the application of the law and insecurity\nof shareholding rights (Luo, 2007).\nThe private benefits (tunneling) of concentrated shareownership and control can come\nin various ways: formal legal protection can be circumvented by dominant shareholders\nthrough the lack of capacity or willingness to monitor corporate governance. There may\nbe opportunities for tunneling through corruption in enforcement of codes, in the\nrecognition of formal ownership rights, in the operation of the courts, in the ability of the\ngovernment to take on the dominant owners, or through transfer prices of assets being\nnegotiable, or providers of assets or products being negotiable (Heugens et al., 2009).\nRussian companies are characterized by inside investors, combining concentrated\nownership with managerial control in part as a result of the way in which privatization\noccurred.\nThe failure of the rule of law in the 1990s, primarily due to non-enforcement, gave rise\nto enormous freedom for enterprise managers to conduct business. This allowedmanagers\nto enrich themselves by legitimate but also illegitimate means\u2014through dishonesty,\nmanipulation, and criminality (Puffer & McCarthy, 2003). Accountability for enterprise\ndirectors broke down in the 1990s and excesses and abuses have stemmed from that\nperiod. Privatization was carried out in 1993 and 1994\u2014initially through a voucher\nsystem that was manipulated in favor of existing enterprise directors (Estrin & Wright,\n1999) and managers were able to buy shares from workers and others at low prices\nwhich did not reflect the potential value of such ownership. Newly entrenched manager-\nowners were able to use their concentrated ownership to abuse minority shareholder\nThe role of informal institutions in corporate governance 57\nrights and rights of joint venture partners through asset stripping and capital flight.\nThese managers combined dominant ownership positions with managerial control and\nhence no constraints either on managerial behavior or on dominant inside shareholder\npower existed. There was privatization but with no supporting institutions to create a\nculture or mentality of accountability (Earle, Estrin, & Leshchenko, 1996). What Puffer\nand McCarthy (2003) call the nomenklatura stage in the late 1990s depicts the control\nover the economy going to the business-government elite with a number of privileged\nplayers enriching themselves and the emergence of a number of leading oligarchs. This\nconsisted in a reciprocally lucrative alliance between bureaucrats and businessmen and\nthe creation of powerful financial industrial groups including Menatep, Onexim,\nInkombank, and Alfa (see Estrin et al., 2009).\nCore shareholders have disproportionate influence on management and both are\nable to take advantage of minority shareholders. The abuses of shareholder rights\nhave occurred in primitive ways such as not allowing shareholders to come to\nmeetings, taking shareholders\u2019 names off registers, and forcing them to fight it out in\nthe Russian courts (Fyodorov, 2001), diluting capital by issuing stock to majority\nshareholders, non-compliance with disclosure requirements, unfair transfer pricing,\nunlawful transactions, and fictitious bankruptcies (Puffer & McCarthy, 2003). The\nloans-for-shares scheme in 1995 was a further abuse whereby leading oligarchs\ngained further shareholder power in exchange for supporting Yeltsin\u2019s reelection.\nThis is described as an incestuous relationship between top businessmen and\ngovernment officials with no transparency, accountability, or disclosure (Puffer &\nMcCarthy, 2003). Since the crisis of 1998, there has been increasing state\ninvolvement in business affairs. It is argued by Buck (2003) that this marks a\nreturn to centuries-old involvement and direction by the state in Russian business\naffairs and that the hostility to outside investors, especially foreign investors, also\nhas long historical roots. It is rare for any company to have more than 20% of its\nshares in free float and available for purchase. State influence has consisted in strong\npersonal links between private owners of the blue-chip mainly non-manufacturing\ncompanies and the government; the Ministry of State Property still remained a\nmajority shareholder in over 12,000 state-owned enterprises and a minority\nshareholder in over 3,800 companies in 2002; the state held 38% of shares in\nGazprom, valued at 8% of Russia\u2019s GDP in 2002, and assets are managed via state\nboards composed of members of ministries and agencies (Buck, 2003).\nDespite some signs of Putin attempting to restore greater accountability and protection\nof minority shareholders, since the early 2000s there has been a movement of additional\ngovernment involvement as a solution to corporate governance abuses. However,\ngovernment involvement in business affairs, despite passing a new code of corporate\nconduct in 2002, has led to further abuses of power and lack of independence of the\njudiciary from the state. The entanglement between the government and Yukos has\nincreased the impression of corruption in corporate governance.\nThe distinctive similarity between China and Russia lies in the role of the state\nconsidered in both cases as a type of informal institution in the sense that the state\u2019s rules\nare not clear, stable, codified, nor transparent in either case. But the difference between\nthem lies in the non-conflicting complementary goals that the state has vis \u00e1 vis company\nowners, in China\u2014both company owners and local states are more interested in\nfostering economic growth and both will do or not do whatever is necessary to gain\n58 S. Estrin, M. Prevezer\nlegitimacy to achieve this. This in large part means a de facto enforcement of ownership\nrights and various types of regulation. The Russian state does not have mutually\ncomplementary goals with most large concentrated owners of firms\u2014its enforcement of\nlaws is seen as arbitrary and hostile to the independent running of companies; there is a\nsometimes antagonistic relationship between the government and oligarchs and\ncorruption takes the form of arbitrary inspections, asset stripping, lack of independence\nof the courts and their use for going after business leaders out of line with government\npolicies. Moreover, large concentrated owners do not have complementary goals with\nminority shareholders. Corporate governance abuses therefore come from both the\nconcentrated inside ownership with abuse of minority shareholders through asset\nstripping, capital flight, tunneling of benefits out of the firm, and through abuses by the\nRussian government in its involvement in business affairs and in its use of the rule of\nlaw vis \u00e1 vis large oligarchic shareholders.\nBrazil\nTables 2 and 3 indicate good formal corporate governance indices for Brazil\ncomprising quite good shareholder rights, strong rule of law, and low risk of\nexpropriation and there has been an improvement in corporate governance codes.\nHowever, there is a weak judiciary and weaker investor rights than the average for\nthe sample. Nevertheless, corruption is not arbitrary (Appendix Table A3) although\nthe judiciary is inefficient: Brazil\u2019s laws allow many appeals so that even fairly\ntrivial cases end up in high courts, with enormous backlogs and huge delays. Life is\ndifficult for companies that pay taxes and comply with labor laws so Brazil has a\nlarge black economy. Companies in the formal economy are forced to abide by\nexpensive and enforced rules (Economist, 2009).\nAll measures of regulation of firms and its enforcement place Brazilian firms as very\nhighly regulated in the formal economy (Appendix Table A2), especially with regard to\nregulations over hiring and firing labor. This forms part of a wider corporate governance\npicture of tightly enforced formal laws and regulations leading to the rise of the informal\neconomy with the aim of getting around those rules. The World Bank Doing Business\nsurvey ranked Brazil 150th out of 183 countries in ease of paying taxes, hiring and firing\nis complicated, and on ease of starting and closing a business Brazil placed 37 out of 43\ncountries surveyed by the World Bank (World Bank, 2005). Dyck and Zingales (2004)\nestimate the value of private benefits extracted by dominant shareholders across a\nsample of countries. Their estimates range from close to zero for most OECD countries\n(but not all) to 65% of firm equity in Brazil.\nWe conclude that the effectiveness of formal institutions in corporate governance in\nBrazil is high in that the rules are good and enforced. Our argument is that they are too\ntightly enforced and that this gives rise to the pervasive informal institution of the shadow\neconomy\u2014both companies opting out of formal legal obligations and entering the black\neconomy and tunneling out of formal companies by shareholders in a position to do so.\nThus the character of Brazil\u2019s informal institutions derives from its large black economy\nand the role of informal institutions is to get around formal rules. Brazil therefore has\naccommodating informal institutions in that there are effective formal but incompatible\ngoals between formal and informal institutions. What we mean by this is that informal\ninstitutions\u2014of corruption, of the black economy\u2014are engaged in getting around the\nThe role of informal institutions in corporate governance 59\nformal rules that are perceived to be overly enforced and over-tight. They do not undermine\nthe formal rules but findways of reconciling the conflicting aims of one groupwith another.\nConclusions\nCorporate governance structures in the BRIC countries are complex. In all four countries,\nwe find relatively concentrated ownership structures and not much in the way of\nprotection of minority shareholders. In Brazil and Russia however, the legal framework\nfor corporate governance looks quite good on paper whereas in China and India the legal\nframework does not look clear-cut. Ownership rights in China particularly are neither\nprotected nor especially transparent; it is advantageous to disguise an enterprise\u2019s\nownership as being state-owned or collectively-owned when in fact there is a private\nentrepreneur or family behind the scenes. India\u2019s formal legal framework is more\ntransparent, but less so in terms of where actual control resides because of pervasive\nfamily or group control. The implications of this diversity in corporate governance\nownership-control structures is also varied, and here the role of informal mechanisms\ncomes to the fore. In practice, ownership structures function fairly well in China due to the\ncompensating wayswhereby there is de facto recognition of ownership rights by the state\nand government, and particularly in China, encouragement to foreign investors and\nassurance that ownership rights will be respected. In India, control by business groups\nsubstitutes to some extent for theweak formal arrangements In contrast, in Russia, despite\nformal legal protection for all shareholders, including minority ones, in practice there is\npoor law enforcement, arbitrary corruption, and undermining of minority rights, in\nparticular by leading shareholders and managers, and an unclear relationship between\nlarge corporate owners and the government. This means that there is fear of expropriation,\nof arbitrary enactment of laws in retrospect, and of no redress for grievances through the\ncourts and it is unclear what mechanisms exist to control managerial behavior.\nWe summarize the relationship between the formal and informal institutions in\nterms of their effects on these aspects of corporate governance in the following way.\nFigure 1 indicates where we would place these corporate governance institutions of\nthe BRIC countries in terms of type of informal institutions they possess. China and\nsome states in India, despite ineffective formal institutions, have informal mechanisms\nthat compensate and replace them\u2014substitutive informal institutions\u2014that promote\npositive investment outcomes both domestically in terms of entrepreneurship and in\nrelation to foreigners leading to strong flows of FDI, particularly in China. We have\nplaced emphasis on the differing types of substitutive informal institutions that operate\nin India compared with China\u2014the role of business groups in India and that of the\nrelationship with the state and local government in China. Business groups operate\nas well in China (Carney et al., 2009b), but the role of the state in organizing them\naround state-owned enterprises and the role of government policy in promoting them\nas substitutive institutions, brings out the state role in China as the most important\ntype of substitutive institution in this period. In contrast Brazil, with largely effective\nformal institutions, has an accommodating informal framework that works in parallel,\nbut with incompatible goals, to the formal institutions and acts to subvert the nature of\nregulation as upheld by the formal rules. Finally, Russia is in the worst position as\nregards investment outcomes, despite formal institutions and governance codes being\n60 S. Estrin, M. Prevezer\nrespectable on paper, because in practice informal institutions of networks (blat)\nbetween leading shareholders, the business groups, and the State compete with the\nformal arrangements.\nContribution of this study and its limitations\nOur main contribution lies in the potential of this framework for theoretical and\nempirical research which brings to the forefront the analysis of informal institutions\nand how their interaction with particular formal rules and institutions can have\nprofound effects on governance, company performance, and business environment.\nOur approach highlights the tensions in thinking about how corporate governance\npractices may affect economic performance, both in emerging economies receiving FDI\nfrom companies headquartered in developed countries and in host countries receiving\nFDI from firms whose headquarters are in emerging economies. How exportable or\nintrinsic to the operation of these companies are the corporate governance practices that\nare formed in their home countries? Does the influence of these informal institutions in\nour BRIC emerging economies carry through to companies headquartered in developed\ncountries, or to companies undertaking FDI outside these particular emerging\neconomies? In other words how intrinsic to the particular country are these interactions\nbetween informal and formal institutions or to what extent are they embodied within\npractices within companies that may not remain rootedwithin those particular countries?\nThis gets to the nub of some of the problems in developing our thinking about the\ninfluence of this interaction between informal and formal institutions, in the sphere of\nIncompatible goals \nbetween formal and \ninformal institutions \nfor corporate \ngovernance \nEffective formal \ninstitutions for corporate\ngovernance \nIneffective formal institutions for \ncorporate governance \nCompatible goals \nbetween formal and \ninformal institutions \nfor corporate \ngovernance \nSubstitutive \ninformal  \nChina \nIndia (good \nstates)\nCompeting informal \nRussia \nIndia (bad states) \nAccommodating informal \nBrazil  \nFigure 1 Corporate governance institutions in BRIC countries in the Helmke-Levitsky framework\nThe role of informal institutions in corporate governance 61\ngovernance and the limitations of this framework for doing so. The framework provides a\nfirst step in bringing together informal and formal institutions and it organizes the\ninteraction along the dimensions of effectiveness and compatibility. What it does not yet\ndo is provide a systematic formulation of which is the applicable perspective or lens\u2014\nwhether policy-maker, manager, labor, creditor, consumer, or shareholder\u2014through\nwhich to view these interactions. Indeed, our analysis of the BRIC countries suggests that\nthere is no single appropriate perspective through which to view these interactions. We\nwould argue that the particular informal institutions relevant to governance measures\nshould be identified through reference to the histories and literatures relating to each\nparticular country. Hence the perspective to be adopted in each case has to be identified in\nrelation to the particular impact that these informal institutions have in different\ngovernance areas, in turn related to where the particular weaknesses lie in effectiveness\nof formal institutions. So for example in China, the literature suggests that security of\nownership has been the governance area most requiring mediation through the informal\ninstitution of the state. Hence the appropriate perspective or level of analysis is through the\nowners of companies\u2014shareholders, those owning and controlling enterprises, be they\ndomestic or foreign owners. The question to ask through this perspective is what\ndifference does the stance of the local state make to company owners in terms of their\nsecurity of tenure from expropriation, security in the face of legalistic uncertainty. For\nRussia, where the key informal institution has been identified as the operation of blat\nnetworks, the perspective and level of analysis should be through an analysis of those\nnetworks and how they intersect with ownership and control arrangements. So for an\nunderstanding of the working of governance in Russia and how formal rules interact\nwith informal, it would be important to pinpoint empirically who shareholders of\ncompanies are, the extent of their interlocks across companies, the composition of\nnetworks, and to get some handle on how these networks cut across formal rules and\nhow they compete with official institutions. In similar fashion for India, the relevant\nperspective for understanding the interaction of formal and informal would be that of\nhow the business group intersects with the formal company shareholder, to understand\nits influence in terms of structure of ownership\u2014how large are business group\nshareholdings, how extensive across companies, how extensive internationally, what\naccess to financial resources do they bring, and many other similar questions which\nwould enrich our understanding of how governance works in that country. For Brazil the\nperspective would need to have a lens to how access to the informal economy operates\non companies\u2014empirically, do companies use the informal economy and for what\nkinds of work, how is the use of informal unregulated resources viewed by the official\nauthorities, how restrictive on performance is using informal resources.\nOur framework can also be used to think about some of the wider issues of\nconvergence or divergence of corporate governance arrangements. This requires\nrecognizing and integrating the influence of these particular informal institutions on more\ndynamic and recent aspects of governance. So for example thinking about inward or\noutward FDI and the transferability of governance arrangements requires analysis of\nwhether those informal institutions are rooted in the host economy or travel with the\ninvesting companies. Again, this will vary and will require empirical research. For\nexample, the influence of business groups on governance arrangements is likely to be\nmore mobile and transferable than the influence of the local Chinese state on Chinese\noutward investment, although the influence of the local state on companies undertaking\n62 S. Estrin, M. Prevezer\ninward FDI from developed countries is likely to be strong and would need to be\nunderstood as part of governance arrangements and its impact on company performance.\nAnalysis of the potential for takeovers or minority investments in Asian business would\nneed to take account of how the informal institutions of business groups, blat, or the state\nwill affect\u2014reinforce, invalidate, or replace\u2014the formal ownership stakes in companies\nand will in turn affect performance of those companies. We emphasize that it is a\ndimension that will need to be incorporated and taken into account with sensitivity as to\nwhich appropriate perspective will be required.\nThe value of our contribution lies in its organizing framework and its inclusion of\ninformal institutions through their interaction with the formal institutional framework. We\ntransfer the Helmke-Levitsky approach, which was applied in an ad hoc way to the\npolitical science sphere, to the economic institutional setting and apply it in a more\nsystematic way to the existing debates about informal institutions and corporate\ngovernance in emerging economies. We emphasize that the relevant perspectives will\nvary according to the mode and on whom the informal institutions operate in each\ncountry. This opens up a huge research theoretical and empirical agenda as to how to\noperationalize the measurement of effects of the interaction of informal institutions on\nformal institutions and as to how to conceive the boundary conditions between the\ndifferent types of informal institutions. Is there movement from one state to another;\nwhen do substitutive informal institutions become accommodating ones; is there a\nconvergence process and through which agents does this operate; which are the more\npermanent fixtures in the informal institutional governance procedures and which may\nbe more transient? We have made a few suggestions as to how one might begin to\nintegrate the influence of informal institutions into the empirical measurement of\ngovernance arrangements, but this is the tip of the iceberg of a much broader research\nagenda that recognizes the penetrative influence and heterogeneity but historical\nspecificity of the informal institutional effect on such arrangements.\nAppendix\nTable 4 Access to finance measures (proportion of firms with access to that type of finance 2003).\nBrazil India China Russia\nAccess to\noverdraft or\nbank credit\nlines or bank\nloans\n35\u201375%\naverage\n35\u201358%\naverage\n25\u201330%\naverage\n42% large\nfirms\nHigh end of\nspectrum for\nlarger firms\n76% SMEs 14% SMEs 16% SMEs\n60% micro\nfirms\n6% micro\nfirms\nReliance on\ninternal funds\nor retained\nearnings\n43\u201353% 30% 53% n.a.\nReliance\non equity\n3\u20134% 16% 11\u201312% n.a.\nThe role of informal institutions in corporate governance 63\nBrazil India China Russia\nInformal\nsources of\nfinance\n2\u20134.5% 15\u201317% 15\u201327% n.a.\n8% large\nfirms\nExternal finance\nas severe obstacle\n85% 27% 29% n.a\nInterest rate spreads 45% n.a. 3.3% 8.5%\nVarious World Bank ICAs and EBRD transition reports.\nTable 5 Various regulation measures (2002).\nBrazil India China Russia\nManagement time spent dealing with regulation 8.1% 14.2% 8.1% 9.5%\nLabor regulations perceived as obstacle to growth 57% 17% 19% n.a.\nOverstaffing (i.e., exit restrictions) 3% 11% 19% n.a.\nNumber of inspections per year 7.8 6.7 26.7 n.a.\nHiring indices 67 33 11 0\nFiring indices 70 90 40 2\nWorld Bank Doing Business data and ICAs.\nTable 6 Corruption measures (2003\u20132004).\nBrazil India China Russia\n% of sales given to secure government contract 12.2% n.a. 2.2% 1.5%\nLosses due to crime as share of sales 0.6% n.a. 0.3% 3%\n% firms seeing corruption as obstacle to growth 67% 38% 27% n.a.\nTransparency International 2004 corruption perception index rank 59 90 71 90\nVarious World Bank ICAs and EBRD transition reports.\nReferences\nAcemoglu, D., & Robinson, J. 2000.
