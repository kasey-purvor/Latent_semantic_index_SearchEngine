However, little is known about the distribution of variation in the most\nconserved functional regions of the human genome. We examined whether different subsets of the\nconserved human genome have been subjected to similar levels of selective constraint within the\nhuman population. We used set theory and high performance computing to carry out an analysis of\nthe density of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) within the evolutionary conserved human\ngenome, at three different selective stringencies, intersected with exonic, intronic and intergenic\ncoordinates.\nResults: We demonstrate that SNP density across the genome is significantly reduced in\nconserved human sequences. Unexpectedly, we further demonstrate that, despite being conserved\nto the same degree, SNP density differs significantly between conserved subsets. Thus, both the\nconserved exonic and intronic genomes contain a significantly reduced density of SNPs compared\nto the conserved intergenic component. Furthermore the intronic and exonic subsets contain\nalmost identical densities of SNPs indicating that they have been constrained to the same degree.\nConclusion: Our findings suggest the presence of a selective linkage between the exonic and\nintronic subsets and ascribes increased significance to the role of introns in human health. In\naddition, the identification of increased plasticity within the conserved intergenic subset suggests an\nimportant role for this subset in the adaptation and diversification of the human population.\nBackground\nAlthough it is widely accepted that genome changes\nhave driven evolution, there is still a lack of consensus\nas to what aspect of genome function are most affected\nto bring about phenotypic change. Many conjecture\nthat changes within exonic coding regions are most\nimportant [1,2] whilst others suggest changes within\nregulatory regions as the driving force of adaptive and\nevolutionary change [3]. While the majority of changes\nproduce no phenotypic effects a small number produce\nthe characteristics that define individuals and popula-\ntions of humans [4]. These functional polymorphisms\nare subject to selection by influences such as environ-\nment (climate, food availability, predation or disease)\nand sexual selection [5]. However, functional poly-\nmorphisms also contain a sub group of polymorphisms\nthat reduce fitness and may increase disease suscept-\nibility [6].\nPage 1 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBioMed Central\nOpen Access\nOne method to address the question of where the\nmajority of functional polymorphisms lie within the\nhuman genome is to examine the densities of poly-\nmorphisms within the different functional components\nof the conserved human genome. Thus, functional\nportions of the genome under the strongest selective\npressure will contain less polymorphisms due to\nremoval of less fit individuals from the population at\nan early age. The advantages of examining the conserved\ngenome to select for functional importance is that\nmechanistic bias towards particular subsets is removed\nand the importance of a particular sequence to survival is\ndefined by its retention through evolution. Once these\nconserved sequences have been identified they can be\ndivided into functional subsets and densities of poly-\nmorphisms within these subsets can be compared. Thus,\nif one portion of the conserved genome contains a lesser\ndensity of polymorphisms, despite being conserved to an\nidentical degree, it can be assumed that this portion has\nbeen subjected to a higher degree of purifying selection\nwithin the human population and is consequently more\nimportant in maintaining species fitness and conferring\ndisease susceptibility prior to reproductive age if\ncompromised.\nIn order to determine the densities of polymorphisms, in\nthe form of SNPs [7] across the entire coding or non-\ncoding portions of the conserved human genome we\nused a novel approach that allows each nucleotide base\nwithin a chromosome to be viewed as a member of a set.\nUsing this set theory approach we were able to further\ngroup these nucleotide sets into defined subsets (exonic,\nintronic or intergenic) and have intersected these subsets\nwith further definitions of the genome i.e. whether the\nnucleotide base is polymorphic or not. Extending this\napproach, comparative analysis of these subsets allows\nus to examine SNP density intersected with the evolu-\ntionary conserved regions (ECRs) of nine other species\nwith the human genome at three different conservation\nlevels, or stringencies, of conservation.\nUsing this simple but unique set theory approach we have\nbeen able to demonstrate that, in keeping with the current\nunderstanding of its importance in evolution and health,\nthe conserved exonic subset has a significantly reduced\ndensity of SNPs and has therefore been subjected to\ngreater selective pressures than other areas of the genome.\nUnexpectedly, comparison of the SNP densities between\nthe intergenic and intronic components, both previously\nconsidered \u201cjunk DNA\u201d, demonstrated significant differ-\nences in SNP densities, such that the intronic portion had\na statistically identical SNP density to the exonic\ncomponent and the intergenic component contained a\nsignificantly higher SNP density. These observations\ndemonstrate that the conserved intronic subset of the\nhuman genome has been subjected to identical levels of\npurifying selection as the exonic component within the\nhuman population. These novel and far reaching obser-\nvations point to a critical role for conserved intronic\nsequences in the maintenance of species fitness and\nhuman health and give added weight to the analysis of\nintronic polymorphisms in the search for the causes of\nhuman genetic disease. In addition, the higher SNP\ndensity within the intergenic subset is indicative of its\nimportant role in driving the adaptive changes that reflect\ndiversity within the human population.\nMethods\nThe genomic data of chromosomal positions for\ntranscripts and the positions of exons within those\ntranscripts were downloaded from the UCSC genome\nbrowser through the table browser portal [8] from the\nUCSC genes table [9]. Chromosomal positions of repeat\nelements were taken from the UCSC genome browser\nfrom the repeat-masker table [10]. SNP data for this\nanalysis was based on the NCBI repository for SNPs;\ndbSNP version 129 (dbSNPv.129), that holds 12,\n483,371 true SNPs. 6, 726,791 of these SNPs currently\nhold validated status, and 6, 406,772 of these lay within\nthe autosomal chromosomes [11]. Coordinates of\npairwise alignments to the human genome were taken\nfrom the ECR Browser through the ECRBase portal [12].\nThe species aligned to human were Pt; Pan troglodytes,\nRm; Macaca mulatta (Rhesus Macaque), Cf; Canis\nfamiliaris, Mm; Mus musculus, Rn; Rattus novergicus,\nMd; Monodelphis domestica, Gg; Gallus gallus, Xt\nXenopus tropicalis and Dr; Danio rerio.\nThese data were held on a MySQL database implemented\non a 56 node High Performance Cluster (HPC) IBM\nblade array operated by Microsoft compute cluster server\n2003. All programs were written in Visual Basic .net on\nthe Microsoft .net 3.5 framework, in a parallel design\nusing the database to pass messages and data to the\nworker nodes. The database was designed so that the\nqueries were optimized during the analysis process, and\nalso to optimize subsequent analysis of the results. In\nutilizing set theory, each chromosome was considered as\na set with its members being its base pairs. Each\nchromosome was considered separately as an entity of\nDNA of independent evolutionary path. The bases of\neach chromosome were categorized according to their\nposition with respect to the different annotation\ninformation gathered.\nAll autosomal chromosomes were analysed (2,\n867,732,772 bases), although the \u00d7 and Y chromosomes\nwere removed from the analysis due to being under\ndifferent selective pressures and being represented\nBMC Genomics 2009, 10:614 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/10\/614\nPage 2 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\ndifferently within the population. The mitochondrial\ngenome was also removed from the analysis. We also\nremoved repetitive regions (1, 288,883,792 bases) as the\nrepetition, frequency and random nature of these repeat\nregions present problems when using pairwise alignment\nanalyses. Un-sequenced regions of the genome, such as\ncentromere regions of each chromosome were also\nremoved from the analysis as no alignments or SNPs\ncan be mapped to these regions (185, 443,999 bases).\nFrom the starting genomic annotations, set algebra was\nused to define subsets for further investigation, as\ndescribed in Table 1. The use of set theory in this\nmanner exploited the data currently available for\npolymorphisms (SNPs) and also the intronic, exonic\nand intergenic regions of the genome. The total number\nof bases within each region type was calculated. Using\nthe chromosomal coordinates of the SNPs, the number\nof SNPs within each region type was also calculated. This\nallowed a basic description of SNP density within each\nregion type to be calculated as:\nSNP density No. of SNPs No. of kilobases= ( \/ )\nThe analysis was carried out on each chromosome with\npairwise alignments of each species aforementioned at\nthree different selective \u201cstringencies\u201d of 70%, 80% and\n90% over 100 base pairs. However at the higher level of\nstringencies the size of conserved genome for large\nevolutionary depth was small and the number of SNPs\nreduces to a very small number. Therefore, in order to\nkeep the analysis statistically valid across all species the\n70% data was selected for the majority of the analysis in\nthis paper although the 80% and 90% data demon-\nstrated a similar trend. Statistical analyses of the results\nwere carried out in MATLAB version 7.1 (Mathworks)\nand Microsoft Excel 2003. Tests of normality were\nundertaken using the Jarque-Bera test (JB test) on the\nmean SNP density counts for all regions as described in\nTable 1 for each chromosome and the null hypothesis of\nnormality could not be rejected[13]. Thus, the average\nchromosomal SNP density is a fair method of represent-\ning the data across the chromosomes and allows the\nANOVA statistical test to be used for comparison\nbetween the subsets at a 95% confidence level. The\naverage validated SNP density per kilo base (kb) of the\ntotal genomic sequence, based on the most current\ndbSNP database (dbSNPv.129), is approximately 2.6.\nResults\nEvaluating bias within the dbSNP dataset\nIt has been recognised in the past that due to the\nmethodology used in discovering SNPs within the\nhuman genome, there has been a bias within dbSNP to\nhold SNPs that are found within protein coding regions\n[14]. In undertaking an investigation of SNP density\nwithin the conserved human genome, it was necessary to\nunderstand the extent of bias within the present dbSNP\ndatabase (dbSNP129). Using the figures given by Zhao,\net al. we have compared SNP data from 2003 to that held\nwithin dbSNP in 2009 (figure 1) [14]. It can be seen that\nthe 48% bias in exonic SNPs has been diluted to\nnegligible levels due to the genome wide SNP discovery\nanalysis of projects such as HAPMAP [15,16].\nConfirmation of the normal distribution of SNP density\nacross the human nuclear genome and between different\nTable 1: Set theory algebra of genomic regions from annotation\ndata\nGenomic Region Set Algebra\nChromosome Chromosome\\Repeats\nTranscripts Transcripts\\Repeats\nExons Exons\\Repeats\nIntrons Transcripts\\Exons\nIntergenic Chromosome\\Transcripts\nConserved Alignments\\Repeats\nConserved Exonic Exons\u2229Alignments\nNon-Conserved Exonic Exons\\Alignments\nConserved Intronic Introns\u2229Alignments\nNon-Conserved Intronic Introns\\Alignments\nConserved Intergenic Intergenic\u2229Alignments\nNon-Conserved Intergenic Intergenic\\Alignments\n\\ denotes set difference, \u2229 denotes set intersection.\nFigure 1\nBar Chart displaying SNP density for 2003 study [14],\ncompared to the present study (2009).\nBMC Genomics 2009, 10:614 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/10\/614\nPage 3 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nchromosomes was undertaken to detect any possibility\nof chromosomal bias density of SNPs that might harm\nthe validity of the ANOVA analysis to be used later in the\ncurrent study. However, using a JB test we found that\nmean chromosomal SNP density followed a normal\ndistribution. While we accept that other types of\nvariation such as CNVs and tandem repeats are also\nimportant in inducing phenotypic variation and con-\nferring disease susceptibility [17] we were unable to\ninclude these in the current analysis as there is currently\ninsufficient information as to the distribution and\ndensity of these variants within the human population\nalthough this situation may change soon[18].\nSNP density with increasing evolutionary depth\nWe defined a chromosomal baseline for SNP density\n(2.6 per kb; based on the dbSNP 129 database), and\nhave determined that the major reservoirs of human SNP\nvariation within the human genome conserved at three\ndifferent stringencies within amniotes are to be found\nwithin the non-coding portion of the genome (the\nintergenic and intronic subsets) (Table 2). For example,\nthe conserved sequence between human and common\nchimpanzee has only 4.4% of all SNPs occurring within\nthe exonic sequence region, the remaining 95.6% is\nwithin the intronic and intergenic regions (Table 2).\nWe sought to determine if there was a relationship\nbetween SNP density and evolutionary depth as it has\nbeen shown that highly conserved sequences in the\nhuman genome are indicative of functionally important\nsequences within genes [19], introns [20], and within\nintergenic regions [21,22]. An examination of the SNP\ndensity within non-conserved regions of the human\ngenome shows that the density does not differ signifi-\ncantly from the chromosomal average (Figure 2A).\nConversely, if we examine SNP densities in portions of\nthe genome that have been conserved we are able to see a\nsignificant reduction of SNP density both with increased\nconserved stringencies and with evolutionary depth\n(Figure 2B). At a conservation stringency of 70% over\n100 bp, we can see a significant reduction of SNP density\nin parts of the genome conserved between human and\nchicken or earlier. At an 80% and 90% conservation\nstringency we are able to see significant reductions in\nSNP density in parts of the genome conserved between\nrodents and humans. The 90% conservation stringency\nat the conservation between Frog - human (Xt) and\nZebrafish - Human (Dr) (conservation over 350-\n450 million years) looses consistency (Figure 2B)\nbecause at the 90% conservation stringency over 100\nbase pairs, many chromosomes are excluded from the\nanalysis as they do not contain sequences conserved to\nthis degree. However, this does not detract from the SNP\ndensity figures provided for Opossum - Human (Md)\nand Chicken - Human (Gg) from the 90% conservation\nthat show conservation up to 300 million years follow-\ning the trend displayed in the 70 and 80% conservation\nstringencies.\nThe results of this analysis demonstrated that SNPs occur\nat a significantly lower rate in the most highly conserved\nregions, conserved since the common ancestors of\nhumans and birds, amphibians and fish, as confirmed\nby one-way ANOVA analysis [23]. The observation that\nmore highly conserved sequences are less polymorphic is\nconsistent with the hypothesis that evolutionary\nTable 2: Numbers of SNPs within the conserved human genome at evolutionary stringency of 70%\n% Identity Species Subset\nExonic Intronic Intergenic\nCount % of Total Count % of Total Count % of Total\n70 Pt 142762 4.4 1412208 43.3 1704439 52.3\nRm 123594 4.4 1224725 43.4 1471048 52.2\nCf 132676 4.5 1289667 43.5 1539598 52.0\nMm 90324 14.4 263730 42.1 272453 43.5\nRn 85933 15.1 236673 41.6 246717 43.3\nMd 59425 27.1 75357 34.4 84128 38.4\nGg 34459 44.3 21368 27.5 21962 28.2\nXt 18291 58.1 6935 22.0 6281 19.9\nDr 9947 62.3 3145 19.7 2886 18.1\nBMC Genomics 2009, 10:614 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/10\/614\nPage 4 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nconservation highlights functionally important sequences.\nThus, genetic lesions within these regions may reduce\nspecies fitness prior to, and during, reproductive age. As a\nresult, these genetic lesions will not be so likely to be seen\nas polymorphisms within the human population. Con-\nversely, polymorphisms within regions that are less\nfunctionally important are less likely to reduce species\nfitness in ability to reproduce and as a result can be\nmaintained within the population.\nComparisons of SNP density between conserved subsets\nBecause they had been conserved to the same degree we\ninitially hypothesised that SNPs would occur with equal\ndensity throughout the conserved genome, irrespective\nof the identity of the conserved subset. We carried out\nANOVA analysis to determine whether there were\nsignificant differences in the densities of SNPs within\nthe intergenic, intronic or exonic subsets at three\ndifferent comparative stringencies. However, compari-\nsons between the SNP densities for the exonic and\nintergenic subsets demonstrate significant differences in\nthe SNP distribution between these subsets (Table 3 and\nillustrated in Figure 3).\nThese data suggest that, despite selecting on the basis of\nconservation, conserved intergenic and conserved exonic\nsequences appear to be subjected to different strengths of\nselective pressure within the human population. We\nconsidered the possibility that the differences observed in\nSNP density between the conserved exonic set and the\nconserved intergenic set reflects differences in the func-\ntional mechanism of these sets. The exonic sequences are\nfunctionally dependent on a mechanism involving the\nthree base pair codon usage required for coding proteins,\nwhilst intergenic regions and intronic regions are non-\ncoding. Interestingly, comparison of the exonic and\nintronic subset by ANOVA analysis (Table 3 and\nillustrated in Figure 3) shows that their SNP densities\nare not significantly different at any depth of conserva-\ntion. This observation indicates that intronic and exonic\nregions in the conserved human genome have been under\nsimilar strengths of selective pressure within the human\npopulation and have accrued SNPs at very similar rates\ndespite differences in their functionalities.\nFigure 2\nBar charts demonstrating SNP densities with the\nconserved (A) and non-conserved (B) regions of the\nhuman genome as determined by pairwise alignment\nwith nine other species (Pt; Pan troglodytes, Rm;\nRhesus Macaque, Cn; Canis familiaris, Mm; Mus\nmusculus, Rn; Rattus novergicus, Md; Monodelphis\ndomestica, Gg; Gallus gallus, Xt Xenopus tropicalis,\nDr; Danio rerio) at three different selective\nstringencies (70%; black bars, 80% grey bars; 90%;\nwhite bars over 100 base pairs) showing the number\nof SNPs per kilobase (y-axis) plotted against species\n(x-axis) that increases in evolutionary \u201cdepth\u201d from\nleft to right.\nTable 3: Mean chromosomal SNP density within the subsets of\nthe conserved genome, at 70% stringency, and statistical\ncomparison of means\nMeans Anova p-value\nSpecies E I IG I v E IG v E IG v I\nPt 2.49 2.50 2.72 0.9022 0.0152 0.0158\nRm 2.49 2.50 2.71 0.8698 0.0177 0.0190\nCf 2.43 2.69 2.69 0.8739 0.0144 0.0160\nMm 2.23 2.23 2.40 0.9491 0.0227 0.0218\nRn 2.23 2.24 2.42 0.8837 0.0176 0.0214\nMd 2.10 2.13 2.37 0.6664 0.0061 0.0141\nGg 1.94 1.94 2.26 0.9396 0.0026 0.0042\nXt 1.79 1.75 2.17 0.5955 0.0083 0.0050\nDr 1.80 1.94 2.36 0.1258 0.0002 0.0085\nE = conserved Exonic, I = conserved Intronic, IG = conserved\nIntergenic.\nBMC Genomics 2009, 10:614 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/10\/614\nPage 5 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBy contrast, the SNP density within the conserved\nintergenic subset is consistently higher than in either\nthe conserved coding or intronic subsets irrespective of\nthe species under comparison (see Table 3 and Figure 3).\nTaking human-chicken conserved regions as an example,\nthe intergenic conserved regions common to chicken and\nhuman have an approximately 16% higher SNP density\nin the human genome than conserved intronic regions\nconserved to the same degree despite both subsets\nrepresenting non-coding DNA.\nDiscussion\nA number of large scale bioinformatic studies have\npreviously explored SNP densities throughout the\nhuman genome [[16,24], and [25]]. However, these\nstudies did not compare SNP densities in portions of the\ngenome that had been conserved. The current study has\nused a whole genome analysis approach using recently\npublished datasets to compare SNP densities within\nmechanistically different portions of the conserved\nhuman genome using a novel set theory approach. We\nhave shown that SNP density decreases throughout the\nentire conserved genome with increased evolutionary\nconservation and that the conserved exonic portion\ncontains a significantly reduced SNP density compared\nto the conserved intergenic region. These results confirm\nprevious hypotheses on a pan-genomic basis and\ndemonstrate that our novel approach is entirely valid.\nHowever, the most exciting and novel discovery of the\ncurrent study is that the intronic portion of the conserved\nhuman genome has been subjected to almost exactly the\nsame degree of selective pressure as the exonic\ncomponent. From a human evolutionary perspective\nthe similarity of selective pressures on the conserved\nintronic and exonic regions make sense if we consider\nthat, in addition to being properly translated, the\nprimary transcripts also require to be properly spliced.\nThus, it has been known for some time that the primary\ntranscripts of as much as 60% of the genome show high\nlevels of tissue specificity in the way that they are\nalternatively spliced [26-29]. This level of sophistication\nrequires that robust mechanisms be in place to control\nthese processes and these appear to have conserved to\nthe same degrees as exonic sequence and demonstrate\nidentical levels of selective pressure [30]. These observa-\ntions contradict the previously perceived view of intronic\nsequences as consisting largely of \u201cjunk\u201d DNA, and place\nthe conserved intronic portion of the human genome on\na similar level of functional importance in the human\npopulation as the conserved exonic genome. Indeed,\nrecent studies have recognised the conservation of\nsplicing regulatory motifs during evolution [31]. The\ncurrent study supports these conclusions and further\nsuggests that, in addition to being highly conserved,\nsplicing signals within introns have been subjected to\nproportionately higher selective constraint than inter-\ngenic regions within the human population.\nThe current study also poses a fascinating contradiction.\nBefore the start of this study we predicted that subsets of\nthe genome that had been conserved to the same degree\nmust contain similar densities of SNPs. However, we\ndemonstrate that SNP density between the three subsets\nanalysed is not the same and the intergenic subset\ncontains significantly higher SNP density to either the\nintronic or exonic subset. This fascinating observation\nsuggests that the variation seen within extant human\npopulations has been selected for in a different way to\nthe variation that has driven vertebrate evolution.\nWe suggest two alternative hypotheses that might\nexplain why the conserved human intergenic genome\ncontains a higher SNP density than either the exonic or\nintronic genome. The first hypothesis is that the majority\nof the sequence within the conserved intergenic genome\nconsists of \u201cjunk\"; DNA that plays little or no functional\nrole and has been conserved by chance. However, a\nnumber of recent studies demonstrating the important\nrole played by conserved intergenic sequence in gene\nregulation argue against this hypothesis [32]. A second\npossibility is that the functional mechanisms controlled\nby the intergenic subset are much more plastic than\nthose of the exonic and intronic subset. Therefore,\nadaptation to changing selective pressures might be\naddressed more rapidly and efficiently as a result of\nregulatory plasticity within the intergenic genome than\nthrough possibly deleterious changes in exonic\/intronic\nFigure 3\nBar chart demonstrating mean SNP densities within\ndifferent subsets of the conserved genome as\ndetermined using pairwise analysis at 70%\nconservation with nine different species.

Thus, mutations of functional exonic or\nintronic sequences would be selected against as they\nare more likely to reduce the fitness of the individual.\nHowever, adaptive change would be more likely to be\nregulatory as the \u201cregulatory genome\u201d mostly repre-\nsented within the intergenic genome appears to be much\nmore plastic and mutations occurring in this part of the\ngenome can be supported. This second explanation goes\nsome way to supporting the case made by those\nindividuals who believe that phenotypic diversity is\nprimarily driven by non-coding regulatory changes [3].\nConclusions\nThe present study suggests the presence of a selective\nlinkage between the exonic and intergenic subsets and\nascribes increased significance to the role of introns in\nhuman health. In addition, the identification of\nincreased plasticity within the conserved intergenic\nsubset suggests an important role for this subset in the\nadaptation and diversification of the human population.\nAuthors\u2019 contributions\nSD undertook the design, computer analysis and\nstatistical analysis of the study.
