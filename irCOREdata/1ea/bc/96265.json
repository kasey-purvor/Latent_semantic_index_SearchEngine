In Dutch this group is known as\nKOPP-children (Kinderen van Ouders met Psychia-\ntrische Problemen). In English these children are often\nreferred to as COPMI (Children of Parents with Mental\nIllness). Even in their adulthood, COPMI-children are\nregarded as a vulnerable.\nThe prevalence of mental illness is increasing, world-\nwide [1]. Accordingly, some of the newly diagnosed\npatients are parents. Although international statistics\nabout global prevalence are not yet available, the subject\nof mentally ill parents is gaining attention [1]. In the\nNetherlands every year about 864,000 parents meet the\ncriteria for a DSM III (Axis one) mental illness diagnosis\n[2]. In 2006 about 1.6 million COPMI-children, younger\nthan 22 years, were living in the Netherlands [3], among\na total Dutch population of 16 million. More than\n700,000 of these children are adolescents between 16 and\n25 years old, living with at least one parent who suffers\nfrom a mental health or substance use disorder. Interna-\ntionally, the prevalence and incidence of COPMI is\nstill unknown. The problems encountered by COPMI-\nchildren have a large impact on their lives, their social\nenvironment and on society as a whole. COPMI-children\nhave, overall, a lower quality of life, and are likely to use\nhealth care and social care facilities frequently. In addi-\ntion participation in school and work can be a problem\n[4]. Previous studies in this field showed that COPMI-\nchildren have 50% likelihood of developing mental health\nproblems themselves throughout life [5]. If a child has\ntwo (biological) parents with mental health or substance\nuse disorders, the likelihood rises to 66% [3]. During\ntheir adolescence, two out of three COPMI-children\nexperience serious problems in coping with a parental\nmanifestation of mental or substance use disorder [4].\nThere is a growing interest in COPMI children, both\nnationally, as well as internationally. Recently, an interna-\ntional conference about the forgotten child, stressed the\nimportance of children of parents with mental illness [1].\nCOPMI have also come to the attention of politicians. In\nMay 2009, for example, members of the Dutch parlia-\nment asked formal questions in the House of Representa-\ntives about the increasing prevalence of COPMI-children,\nthe consequences of their situation and what solutions\nwere needed. Thus, societal impact and political interest\nis growing nationally and internationally.\nTo date, only two studies have examined the effective-\nness of COPMI interventions. As a consequence most of\nthe interventions developed for this group have not yet\nbeen evaluated and there is no evidence relating their\ncost-effectiveness [6].\nTwo COPMI interventions used on a large scale in the\nNetherlands and elsewhere are based on face-to face\npsycho-educative family intervention. Literature shows\nthat these psycho-educative interventions are effective in\nterms of protective factors [7,8].\nIn spite the elevated risks, only a few prevention pro-\ngrams are offered for COPMI-children and these reach\nonly part of the target population. One of the options\nfor improving accessibility is providing internet-based\ninterventions (E-programs). In the Netherlands an\nE-program called Kopstoring has recently been\ndeveloped.\nIn brief the Kopstoring intervention is an online\n8-week educative course which strengthens the coping\nskills of COPMI-children, and provides knowledge\nabout their parents\u2019 mental illness. In a secure chat box\nCOPMI-children work through the themes of the\ncourse. Kopstoring is an online intervention for COPMI\nchildren aged 16 to 25 years.\nIn this study we will examine the (cost-) effectiveness\nof the Kopstoring E-program for COPMI-children. To\nour knowledge this is the first study to assess the (cost-)\neffectiveness of E-programs for COPMI-children. Besides\nthe information regarding cost-effectiveness, this study\nwill also yield information about COPMI-children\u2019s use\nof healthcare resources.\nThis study builds on an existing COPMI pilot study\nwhich assesses the effects of the online intervention [9].\nE-mental health is a relatively new method for delivering\ninterventions in the health care sector at affordable\ncosts. A series of recent studies [10] have demonstrated\nthe positive effects of E-mental health interventions and\nhighlighted features such as therapists being able to\ndelegate routine aspects of their work to computers,\nthus freeing scarce resources for those patients most in\nneed of it, and delivering interventions in a well struc-\ntured way based on the best available evidence [11]. Sev-\neral systematic reviews [12,13] have identified the\neffectiveness of E-mental health interventions. Despite a\npromising trend several authors stresses that both the\neffectiveness as well as the costs-effectiveness of E-\nmental health interventions need to be assessed [12,14].\nIn brief, the current study aims to examine the benefi-\ncial effects of online intervention for COPMI-children,\nweighing these against health and societal costs. Poten-\ntially, a preventive Kopstoring program will reduce\nsymptoms, behavioural and serious psychological pro-\nblems, strengthen the COPMI-children\u2019s emotional and\nsocial functioning and coping skills, and improve their\nrelationship with the ill parent. A decrease in the con-\nsumption of health care may follow. Production losses,\nWoolderink et al.

This study will lead to\nmore solid evidence-based information about the\nKopstoring program. This study will be the first to pro-\nvide insight into the cost-effectiveness of a preventive\nE-program for COPMI-children.\nMethods\/Design\nThe design will be a multi-centered RCT. The project\nwill consist of an effectiveness study, an economic eva-\nluation, and a process evaluation.\nObjective and research questions\nThe main study objective is to evaluate the effects, cost-\neffectiveness and the process of providing an internet-\nbased preventive intervention for COPMI-children from\n16-25 years old.\nThe main research question is as follows: From a soci-\netal perspective, is the online psycho-educative preven-\ntion program Kopstoring a cost-effective program for\nreducing the symptoms of children of parents with men-\ntal or substance use disorders? In addition, is the inter-\nvention delivered in time and according to prevailing\nstandards, according to the protocol and does it meet\nthe expectations of caregivers and participants involved?\nThe following sub-questions can be indentified for the\neffectiveness study, the economic evaluation study and\nprocess evaluation:\nEffectiveness study\n1. Does the preventive online intervention reduce the\nchild\u2019s internalizing and externalizing symptoms and\nprevent behavioural and coping problems which are due\nto the parent\u2019s mental illness?\n2. Does the preventive online intervention strengthen\nthe child\u2019s emotional and social functioning and coping\nskills?\n3. Does the preventive online intervention establish a\nhigher quality of life for COPMI-children?\nEconomic evaluation study\n1. From a societal perspective, is the delivery of the\nKopstoring intervention, in comparison with waiting-list\ncare as usual, preferable in terms of costs, effects and\nutilities?\nProcess evaluation\n1. Is the intervention delivered in time and does it meet\naccepted standards, according protocol?\n2. Is the protocol being followed?\n3. What do participants expect from the intervention\nand what do they believe about the effect of the inter-\nvention (credibility and expectancy)?\nDesign\nThis study will consist of an effectiveness study, an eco-\nnomic evaluation study and a process evaluation.\nThe basis of the effectiveness study will be a prag-\nmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT), in which the\nKopstoring program will be compared with a waiting list\ncontrol condition which reflects care as usual (CAU).\nThe interventions last 8 consecutive weeks with a ninth\nmeeting after a month. Figure 1 presents the flow chart\nfor the study. Cost and outcome measures will be taken\nat baseline and at 3 months and 6 months after baseline\nin both conditions. An extended follow-up at 12 months\nwill be conducted in the intervention arm of the trial, to\nmonitor the long-term costs and effects of the\nintervention.\nIn the economic evaluation we will compare incre-\nmental costs and incremental outcomes of the\nKopstoring intervention in relation to care as usual.\nThis economic evaluation will involve both a cost-\neffectiveness analysis (CEA) and a cost-utility analysis\n(CUA). The primary outcome measure for the eco-\nnomic evaluation will be the prevention of the devel-\nopment of symptoms over the 6 months of follow-up.\nWithin the cost-utility analysis, outcomes will be mea-\nsured by means of the standard Dutch version of the\nEuroQol. In the CEA, the incremental cost-effective-\nness ratio (ICER) will be expressed as the incremental\ncosts per point improvement on the Youth Self Report\nQuestionnaire. The primary outcomes measured for\nthe cost-utility analysis will be QALYs, based on the\nEuroQol utility scores [15,16]. In the CUA, the ICER\nwill be expressed as the incremental cost per QALY.\nThis economic evaluation will take a societal perspec-\ntive, including all relevant costs and outcomes.\nProcess evaluation\nDuring the study we will include a process evaluation in\nwhich we assess several aspects concerning the process\nof the execution of the intervention and how it is per-\nceived by caregivers and the recipients. We want to\nidentify whether the execution of the RCT is going\naccording to protocol and if so, whether the interven-\ntion is meeting accepted standards [17]. We will\nuse qualitative methods to derive this information. We\nwill interview the experts (caregivers) who are involved\nin the delivery of the Kopstoring program to gain\nknowledge about the factors which harm or stimulate\nworking according to protocol. The recipients will\nreceive a short questionnaire with items about aspects\nof the intervention.\nCredibility and expectations about internet interventions\nand specifically the Kopstoring intervention will be mea-\nsured at baseline and after receiving the internet interven-\ntion. These results will be used for the process evaluation\nWoolderink et al. BMC Public Health 2010, 10:470\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/10\/470\nPage 3 of 9\nto gain knowledge about what respondents expect from\nthis internet therapy and how they rate it in terms of cred-\nits. Caregivers will also be asked to fill in the Credibility\nand Expectancy Questionnaire. In addition the statistics\nlinked to the database system can be useful in determining\nwhether the protocol was followed\nTarget population\nThe target group is defined as young people aged\nbetween 16 and 25 years who have at least one parent\nsuffering from a psychiatric disorder, multiple psycholo-\ngical disorders or an addiction problem. For inclusion in\nour study, young people have no internalizing and exter-\nnalising problems. This will be defined using the Youth\nSelf report List (YSR); the cutoff scores for girls will be\na score of 21 and for boys a score of 16. If the young\nperson has a score above the cutoff score, they will be\nreferred for treatment or other services. In addition, the\nyoung person has to be sufficiently fluent in the Dutch\nlanguage, have access to the internet and be able to use\na chat box - to participate actively and be able to listen\nto other participants. For young people aged 16-17\ninformed consent from the parent is also required. For\nthose aged 18 and over, informed consent of the adoles-\ncent is sufficient. Those who are younger than 16 years\nor older than 25 years are excluded from our study.\nRecruitment\nCOPMI-children will be recruited in several ways. First,\nthey can be recruited through, the online Kopstoring pro-\ngram (http:\/\/www.kopstoring.nl). This open website has\ninformation about the study and its objectives. Second,\nthe mental health institutions who are cooperating in this\nproject and provide the online program give information\nabout the Kopstoring program to potential respondents\nand can recruit young people through their websites,\ndatabases, networks and contacts. General practitioners\n(GPs) will be informed about the study so they can also\npreselect eligible respondents. There will also be banners\nand links created for the internet. Public Relations (PR)\nwill be led by the Trimbos Institute which has experts\nand experience in the field of recruitment and PR.\nFigure 1 Flow chart study design.\nWoolderink et al. BMC Public Health 2010, 10:470\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/10\/470\nPage 4 of 9\nIntervention\nThe Kopstoring program consists of 8 consecutive\nonline weekly chat group meetings and a ninth evalua-\ntion meeting in a chat box at the website http:\/\/www.\nkopstoring.nl. The aim of the intervention is to\nstrengthen protective factors, such as self-management\nskills and psychological well-being, and prevent the\ndevelopment of psychological disorders. The experts\n(prevention workers and psychologists from mental\nhealth care institutions) involved in the delivery of\nthe intervention are specialized in the field of COPMI-\nproblems and in the prevention of mental health\nproblems in young people. The intervention is protocol-\ndriven and well-structured. There are 8 themes, so each\nweek there is a new theme. The themes are; getting\nacquainted with the home situation, roles in families,\nthoughts and feelings, questions about addiction and\nmental problems, different styles of behaviour, social\nnetworks, leading your own life in relation to social net-\nworks and what is coming up in the future. The partici-\npants are required to carry out homework assignments\nbefore entering the chat box (chat room) meeting [18].\nThe Kopstoring program is part of an informative web-\nsite which also provides an e-mail service and chat\noptions, alongside the Kopstoring program.\nCare as usual in the Netherlands\nThe control condition in this trial is a waiting list with\nunrestricted access to care as usual. Usual care in the\nNetherlands is a mix of several services. In this study,\ncare as usual is not standardized and there are no proto-\ncols. Young people can request a lot of services: for\nexample, a general practitioner, a psychologist, or men-\ntal health or institutional services such as counselling\nsessions.\nSample Size calculation\nThe sample size calculation is based on the ability to\ndetect a medium size or larger clinical effect. This corre-\nsponds to a standardized mean difference (Cohen\u2019s d) of\nd > 0.45 [19]. We will test the hypotheses at a conven-\ntional power of (1 - beta) = 0.80 and alpha = 0.05, 2-\ntailed (cf. Friedman et al., 1996). For this n = 78 is\nrequired per condition, therefore a total of 156 partici-\npants. Finally we want to compensate for possible drop-\nout during the trial. The drop-out rate from the pilot\nstudy was 28% [9]. We therefore need to enrol 156\/(1-\n0.28) = 214 participants during the trial.\nCost and outcome measurement\nI) Effectiveness study\nClinical outcomes will be measured using various ques-\ntionnaires. The primary outcome of the clinical effect\nstudy is the symptoms, complaints and well-being of the\nyoung person measured with three questionnaires, each\nfocussing on a different aspect of symptoms, complaints\nand well-being.\nYouth Self Report List (YSR) of the Children Behaviour\nChecklist\nThe Youth Self Report List will be used to measure each\nsubject\u2019s competencies and behavioural problems. The\ninstrument is proven to be valid and has a good internal\nconsistency [20,21]. The Youth Self Report List (YSR) is\npart of the Child Behaviour Checklist which is a ques-\ntionnaire measuring internalizing and externalizing\npsychological problems in young people [20,21]. The\nSelf-Report List has three versions: one each for parents,\nteachers and young people. For this study we use the\nyoung person\u2019s version.\nSecondary clinical outcome\nThe Effect Evaluation List (EEVL) is a Dutch question-\nnaire tailor-made for the online Kopstoring program: it\nmeasures several aspects of coping skills and function-\ning. The instrument consists of 8 items in two main\ndimensions: biographical information about the respon-\ndent (19 items) and the effect of the COPMI interven-\ntion (61 Items). The EEVL has been proven to be valid\nand has good reliability [22].\nQuality of Life (EuroQol 5D)\nThe EQ-5D is a self-administered questionnaire. Both\ngeneric quality of life, as well as utilities, will be derived\nby means of the EQ-5D, which will be completed by the\nyoung people. The EQ-5D has been chosen because it is\na widely used quality of life instrument (nationally and\ninternationally) and its reliability and validity is well\nestablished [23]. The EQ-5D contains 5 dimensions of\nhealth-related quality of life: mobility, self-care, daily\nactivities, pain\/discomfort and depression\/anxiety. Each\ndimension can be rated on three levels: no problems,\nsome problems and major problems. In addition, the\nEQ-5D consists of a visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging\nfrom zero (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best\nimaginable health state).\nUtilities\nUtilities will be derived from the EQ-5D using the fol-\nlowing steps. The 5 dimensions will be summarized into\na health state. Utility values will be calculated for these\nhealth states, using preferences elicited from a general\npopulation, the so-called algorithms. One algorithm has\nbeen established using a general population from the\nUK, the Dolan tariff [24]. For the sensitivity analysis the\nDutch algorithm will be used [25]. The utility values\nderived will be used to compute Quality Adjusted Life\nYears (QALYs). A QALY combines survival and utilities.\nWoolderink et al. BMC Public Health 2010, 10:470\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/10\/470\nPage 5 of 9\nThe utilities at the three time points will be used to\ncompute the Quality Adjusted Life Years gained\n(QALY) using of the area under the curve method.\nSymptom Checklist (SCL-90)\nThe Symptom Checklist has 90 items, each answered\nusing 5 options covering 8 dimensions. These dimen-\nsions are: phobia, anxiety, depression, physical com-\nplaints, insufficient acting and thinking, distrust and\ninterpersonal sensitivity, hostility and sleeping problems.\nThe SCL-90 is a psychopathology-indicator and covers\nboth somatic and psychological symptoms. It takes\nabout 20 minutes to complete and has been tested and\nappears to be a valid instrument [26].\nII) Economic evaluation study\nIn this economic evaluation we collect data on service\nuse to derive the costs of using these services.\nCollecting data on service use:\nResource use questionnaire The use of the Kopstoring\nprogram will be measured as well as the use of other\nresources both within and outside the healthcare sector.\nA questionnaire will be developed to measure the use of\nresources.\nProductivity losses (PRODISQ) Production losses will\nbe measured using the PROductivity losses and DISabil-\nity Questionnaire (PRODISQ), a module-based question-\nnaire. This questionnaire will be used only for those\nwith a paid job. Three modules will be used for this\nstudy to gather data on absenteeism and presenteeism.\nProduction costs will be calculated by using the friction\ncost method [27,28].\nProductivity losses (PRODISQ) and School absentee-\nism For the young people who go to school, we adjusted\nthe same three modules from the PRODISQ as we did\nto measure absentieesm and presenteeism among the\nworking young persons.\nIII) Process evaluation\nQualitative Interviews Interviews will be conducted\nwith the caregivers of the mental health services who\nprovide the online Kopstoring program. We will ask\nthem questions about offering the program as described\nin the protocol and about the process of enrolment. In\naddition to conducting these qualitative interviews with\ncaregivers, we will send a short online questionnaire to\nthe program respondents.\nCredibility\/Expectations Questionnaire (CEQ) The\ncredibility and expectations questionnaire, a 6-item list,\nis used to determine what the respondents expect from\nthe online program and how many credits they give the\nintervention.\nCredibility and Expectations will be measured by the\nCredibility\/Expectations Questionnaire (CEQ) which\nconsists of 6 items using a 9- or sometimes 10-point\nLikert scale. This instrument is meant to measure the\nexpectations and credibility a person has about the\nreceived intervention [29]. The questionnaire can be\nused at baseline and during follow-up to compute the\ndifferent scores in expectation and credits one gives to a\nparticular therapy. In their article Borkovec et al show\nthat the instrument has proven to be valid and that the\npsychometric properties are of good quality[30]. It will\ntake around five minutes to complete the 6 items of this\ninstrument.\nAnalyses\nData will be analysed according to the intention-to-treat\nprinciple, which means including data from all partici-\npants irregardless of whether they received the interven-\ntion or not. Missing data on the item level will be\nhandled using SPSS missing values analysis. Completely\nmissing measurements will be handled using multiple\nimputation. A baseline analysis will be performed to\nexamine the comparability of groups at baseline for\nboth costs and outcomes. Differences in baseline will be\ncontrolled using applied methods to correct these differ-\nences [31]. Losses to follow-up will be described.\nThe analysis consists of comparing the assessments\nand scores of the respondents on the questionnaires.\nClinical outcomes after the intervention (8 weeks), at\nthree months, six months and twelve months will be\ncompared between groups and within groups, which\nmeans we want to compare the effect of the intervention\nin respondents in the intervention and control groups\nand assess the additional effects before and after receiv-\ning the intervention.\nII) Economic evaluation study\nThe economic analysis will also be performed according\nto the intention-to-treat principle. Handling of missing\ndata will be similar to the effectiveness study. A baseline\nanalysis for the economic evaluation will also be per-\nformed to examine the comparability of groups at base-\nline for both costs and outcomes. If necessary methods\nwill be applied to control for differences in baseline\n[31]. Despite the usual skewness in the distribution of\ncosts, the arithmetic means are generally considered to\nbe the most appropriate measures to describe cost data\n[32]. Therefore arithmetic means (and standard devia-\ntions) will be presented. Non-parametric bootstrapping\nwill be used to test for statistical differences in\ncosts between the intervention and control group. Non-\nparametric bootstrapping is a method based on random\nsampling with replacement based on the participants\u2019\nindividual data [33]. The bootstrap replications will\nbe used to calculate 95% confidence intervals around\nthe costs (95% CI), based on the 2.5th and 97.5th\npercentiles.\nThe incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) will be\ndetermined on the basis of incremental costs and the\nWoolderink et al. BMC Public Health 2010, 10:470\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/10\/470\nPage 6 of 9\neffects of the Kopstoring program in comparison with\ncare as usual. The cost-effectiveness ratio will be stated\nin terms of costs per unit of outcome; the cost-utility\nratio will focus on the incremental cost per QALY\ngained. The ICER will be calculated as follows. ICER =\n(Ci - Cc)\/(Ei - Ec), where Ci is the annual total cost of\nthe Kopstoring group, Cc is the annual total cost of the\ncare as usual group, Ei is the effects at the 6-month\nfollow-up for the Kopstoring group and Ec is the effect at\nthe 6-month follow-up for the care as usual group.\nThe robustness of the ICER will be checked by non-\nparametric bootstrapping. Bootstrap simulations will also\nbe conducted in order to quantify the uncertainty around\nthe ICER, yielding information about the joint distribu-\ntion of cost and effect differences. The bootstrapped cost-\neffectiveness ratios will be plotted subsequently in a cost\neffectiveness plane, in which the vertical line reflects the\ndifference in costs and the horizontal line reflects the dif-\nference in effectiveness. The choice of treatment depends\non the maximum amount of money that society is pre-\npared to pay for a gain in effectiveness. Therefore, the\nbootstrapped ICERs will also be depicted in a cost-effec-\ntiveness acceptability curve, showing the probability that\nKopstoring is cost-effective using a range of ceiling ratios.\nTo demonstrate the robustness of our base-case findings\na multi-way sensitivity analyses will be performed in\nwhich assumptions in the base case analysis will be recal-\nculated to assess whether they have influenced the incre-\nmental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), for example by\nvarying unit costs and volumes between minimum and\nmaximum [33]. The bootstrap replications will be used to\ncalculate 95% confidence intervals around the median\ncosts, while the 95% CI will be based on the 2.5th and\n97.5th percentiles.\nIII) Process evaluation\nWe will monitor whether certain aspects are going\naccording to protocol and on schedule by qualitative\ninterviews, data assessment and the use of the Credibil-\nity and Expectancy questionnaire.\nThe analysis will consist of the following steps:\n1) Analyzing the qualitative interviews\n2) Comparing the results of the analysis with the stan-\ndards and requirements in the protocol\n3) Identifying factors where the delivery of the inter-\nvention deviates from protocol (factors that harm work-\ning according protocol) and factors that stimulate\nworking according to protocol (success factors)\n4) Analyzing the participants\u2019 expectations and beliefs\nin the effects of the intervention according the C&E\nquestionnaire.\nCollaboration\nThe initiative for this study came from Maastricht Uni-\nversity working together with Trimbos Institute. This\nstudy will be conducted with support from professionals\nfrom several disciplines. The London School of Eco-\nnomics will be involved in the academic part of the\nstudy. Mental health institutions in the Netherlands will\nbe involved in the delivery of the online preventative\nintervention, including Dimence (Deventer), GGNet\n(Warnsveld), De Gelderse Roos (Wolfheze), GGNet\nApeldoorn, Dimence Almelo, GGZ Oost Brabant, De\nGrote Rivieren and GGZ Zuid Holland. The Trimbos\nInstitute will be responsible for developing a PR-strategy\nand will be involved with the recruitment of\nparticipants.\nThis study is registered in the Netherlands Trial Reg-\nister, part of the Dutch Cochrane Centre (NTR1982).\nThe ethical committee from Maastricht University Aca-\ndemic Hospital has given ethical approval for perform-\ning the experiment.\nDiscussion\nThe field of E-mental health and internet therapies is\ngrowing. Many new therapies have been developed, but\nfew have been evaluated. A lot of them are preventative,\nso there will be no direct harm if effectiveness is not\nestablished. The implementation of evidence-based med-\nicine means that the effectiveness and costs of new\ntherapies and interventions should be established. This\nstudy will provide information about E-interventions in\nDutch society in general, but will also yield specific\ninformation about a vulnerable group of young people\nin society. In the event that we can show effectiveness\nand cost-effectiveness, the aim will be to implement this\nintervention as standard care in the Netherlands.\nMethodological considerations\nInterventions in the field of COPMI-problems are rela-\ntively new and internet interventions have scarcely been\nevaluated. Internet-driven research has the advantage of\nbeing anonymous, but it can be hard to keep partici-\npants in the study because there is no face-to face con-\ntact with the participants. The participants in this study\nare 16-25 years old. When a minor is involved in scien-\ntific research, the informed consent of the parents as\nwell as of the minor is needed according to Dutch Law\n(WMO art. 4). This requirement for extended consent\nmight lead to the under representation of younger parti-\ncipants, as they might not want to inform their parents\nabout participating in the study and therefore be unable\nto get their consent.\nFeasibility\nFeasibility was a very important key point in writing the\nproposal for the study. To establish effectiveness 214\nrespondents are needed. To ensure we could recruit suf-\nficient young people we devised a PR-strategy including\nWoolderink et al. BMC Public Health 2010, 10:470\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/10\/470\nPage 7 of 9\nhigh quality advertisements. Links banners and other\nmethods for reaching the target population, will be\nused. A special budget has been reserved for this\npurpose.\nConclusion\nRecent developments show the pressing need for study-\ning the effectiveness of interventions for children of par-\nents with a mental illness or substance use disorder. In\na meeting of the House of Representatives in May 2009,\ncritical questions were asked about the growing preva-\nlence of COPMI-children and the lack of good interven-\ntions [34]. While E-mental health interventions are\nlikely to be easily accessed by young people, there is a\npressing need to study the (cost)-effectiveness of these\nrecent developments in health care. There is hardly any\nevidence, but what exists is promising [12]. This study\nbuilds on this evidence and provides a unique opportu-\nnity for developing research techniques in this new area,\nas well as supporting the provision of better services for\nCOPMI.\nAcknowledgements\nThe study is financed by the ZonMW prevention programme.
