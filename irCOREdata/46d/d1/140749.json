Introduction\nThe patterning of a material\u2019s surface is a generic tool for altering its physical and\nchemical characteristics i.e. texture, optical and electromagnetic properties,\nrecognition abilities and responsiveness to the environment (Chailapakul and Crooks,\n1993; Appell, 2002; Assender et al., 2002). Thus considerable effort has been\nexpended in the development of methods for the deposition of materials encoding\ntwo- and three-dimensional information on the nanoscale level (Liu and Amro, 2002;\nZhang, 2003). Methods for molecular patterning include: ordered deposition of\nnucleic acids, fusion proteins and self-assembled monolayers (Seeman, 1999;\nNiemeyer, 2000; Moll et al., 2002; Ulman, 2001; Jerome et al., 1987);\nmicrolithography and microcontact printing technology (Whitesides et al., 1991;\nWhitesides et al., 2001; Kumar and Whitesides, 1993; Kumar et al., 1994; Chou et al.,\n2005). Here we present a different approach to the nano-patterning of metal surfaces\nwhich does not involve the physical transfer of material from the template to the\npatterned surface. Instead, the pattern, in the form of molecular imprints, has been\ncreated by solidifying molten gallium in the presence of immobilised protein\ntemplates. The template is mechanically removed from the gallium leaving cavities\nresembling \u201cnegative\u201d mirror images of the template proteins, capable of their\nselective rebinding. The approach resembles molecular imprinting in organic polymer\nand inorganic sol-gel matrices in the sense that molecular templates determine the\nshape of the cavities created (Wulff, 1995; Mosbach and Ramstrom, 1996) but opens\nup an entirely new class of material for electronic sensor design due to conductive\nnature of material used.\n52 Materials and Methods\n2.1. Surface preparation.\nTemplate surfaces were prepared by physical adsorption of the following proteins\nonto freshly cleaved ruby mica: horseradish peroxidase (HRP), purified bovine serum\nalbumin (BSA), RNA polymerase, urease from Jack Bean, Dps (DNA-binding\nproteins from starved cells) from E. coli. All proteins were deposited onto mica from\na 6 nM solution in deposition buffer (4 mM Hepes, 10 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2 pH\n7.4). The deposition drop was incubated onto the surface for 3 minutes, rinsed with\nwater milli-Q and dried in a nitrogen stream.\n2.2. Casting of the metal surfaces.\nCassettes for casting the metal surfaces were prepared from a borosilicate glass slide\nand a mica slide, separated with a Teflon spacer of 50 mm thickness. Pure molten\ngallium (T = 37 0C) was poured into the cassette, and left to solidify at room\ntemperature for 30 min in a humid controlled chamber. Finally the metal surface was\npeeled off the template.\n2.3. Atomic force microscopy analysis.\nAtomic force microscopy imaging was performed with a Nanoscope IIIA (Veeco\nInstruments), equipped with a type E scanner and operating in a \u201ctapping mode\u201d,\nusing diving-board cantilevers mounted with a pyramidal tip (Veeco Instruments). All\nimages were acquired \u201cin air\u201d on dried samples with a scan rate of ~3 lines\/s and a\n6scan size of 2 mm. Image inspection and analysis was carried out with the Nanoscope\nsoftware.\n2.4. Dissociation constant calculation.\nMetal surfaces printed with HRP, albumin printed metal surfaces and control gallium\nfoils were cut into circles of 4 mm diameter, each placed into a microtiter plate well.\nGallium foils were incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes with protein at a\nrange of concentrations, varying from 0.23 nM to 23 mM, dissolved in 50 mM MES\nbuffer (pH 6.0). Non-specifically bound protein was removed by a double washing\nwith Milli-Q water followed by a washing step in MES buffer containing 0.05 %\nTween-20. Gallium surfaces were dried in a nitrogen stream. The quantity of adsorbed\nprotein was measured using 3,3\u2019,5,5\u2019-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) assay according to\nPorstman and Kiessig (1992). Dissociation constants were calculated from data\nlinearised with a Scatchard-Rosenthal plot. Replica printing was tested by repeating\nthe process of solidifying gallium on the same mica slide with immobilised HRP.\nBinding analysis was performed as described previously.\n3. Results and discussion\nGallium was selected for investigation as a printable material due to its low melting\ntemperature (\uf07e30\uf0b0C), which seems particularly convenient for the imprinting of\nbiological molecules. Several proteins, varying in molecular mass from 44 to 500\nkDa, were immobilised on the surface of mica slides for use as templates. The molten\nmetal was brought into contact with the template-coated surface and allowed to\nsolidify between two slides at room temperature (Gilfillan and Bent Jr., 1934). Mica\n7slides were peeled from the gallium films to reveal flat foils bearing imprints on the\nsurface. The morphology of the printed metal surfaces, analysed by atomic force\nmicroscopy (AFM), showed indentations of nanometre dimensions, complementary in\naverage density distribution and size to the template (see AFM images in Figures 1a,\n1b and Figure 2). The control metal foil, formed between two mica slides in the\nabsence of protein template had a very flat surface without any structural features\n(Figure 1c). Atomic unevenness of the gallium surface manifested itself at a scale\nbelow 2 nm. As a result it was difficult to visualise relatively small imprints (\uf07e 5 nm)\nformed by the templates with molecular masses below 60 kDa.\nNo protein molecules were detected by AFM on the printed surfaces which indicated\nthat the mechanical separation procedure for removal of the template had been\nsuccessfully achieved. The non-transfer of template material onto the printed surface\nwas confirmed independently by an assay for enzymatic activity performed on\ngallium foils printed with horseradish peroxidase (HRP), which showed no activity.\nThe printing of metal surfaces resulted in mirror images of the template molecules,\nwith consistent reproduction of the template pattern. There was a correlation between\nthe size of the template and the size of the imprints formed (Table 1). Thus, printed\nmetal surfaces have the potential to mirror nano-scale templates such proteins, fibrils\nor synthetic motifs in a desired two dimensional geometry, as suggested by Liu and\nAmro (2002). Despite a full understanding of the nature of the metal printing process\nis still to be found, it seems that casting nano-sized impressions on gallium foils has\nstriking resemblance to the molecular imprinting process, thus suggesting the term\n\u2018metal imprinting\u2019 for the observed phenomenon.\n8An important question was whether the prints created in gallium would recognise\ntheir respective molecular templates in a similar way to imprints formed in\nmolecularly imprinted organic polymers (Bossi et al., 2001). This possibility was\ninvestigated by an analysis of the binding properties of gallium surfaces to HRP. The\ndissociation constants were calculated for the printed and non-printed surfaces. The\nHRP-printed metal surface possesses more than ten times higher affinity to the\ntemplate protein HRP compared with a non-printed surface or surface printed with\nalbumin (see Table 2). Printed surfaces also possessed a significantly greater quantity\nof binding sites, compared with their non-printed counterparts. The enhanced binding\nof template protein to printed metal surfaces supports the hypothesis that shape-\ncontrolled recognition, generally associated with imprinted polymers (Wulff, 1995;\nMosbach and Ramstrom, 1996; Bossi et al., 2001) and synthetic hosts (Rebek, 1985)\nis responsible for the increased affinity of the templated metal surfaces. A greater\nnumber of binding sites was observed in case of albumin printed gallium challenged\nwith HRP, due probably to an increase in the roughness of the surface, respect the\ncontrol gallium.\nThe printing process can be repeated using the same parent template layer with the\nrecognition ability of the second replica surface being very similar to the first. The\nprocess however becomes progressively less efficient after the third and subsequent\nprinting cycles, presumably due to the denaturation of protein templates as a result of\nmechanical and thermal stresses.\n4. Conclusions\nThe casting of structures in metal, as coins or bronze statues, is an ancient art, but can\nmetals be used to replicate molecular-scale objects, a million times smaller than the\n9average coin? Results here proposed with the low melting point metal (gallium) just\nsupport that, using protein molecules fixed to a surface as the \"mould\". The metallic\nprints not only replicate the shape and size of the proteins used as template; they also\nshow specific binding for the template species. In our view this is the first successful\ndemonstration of the creation of molecular imprints, using a microcontact method,\nand a material that differs significantly from the traditional approaches, involving\norganic or inorganic polymers. The conditions for metal printing could be further\noptimised using alloys with different composition and melting points. Apart from\ntheir academic interest \u201cmolecular mirrors\u201d, which combine conductive properties\nwith molecular selectivity, may open new avenues in optical and electronic sensor\ndesign. In particular it is possible to envisage the development of electrochemical\nsensors based on imprinted metal surfaces.\n5.
