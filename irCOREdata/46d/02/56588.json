The microfossil technique has wide \n\u201eforensic\u201f application as even very small samples of rock (10s of grams) can yield \n100s of fossil specimens. The technique can be used to provenance building \nmaterials from classical contexts through to the present (e.g. Wilkinson et al., 2008). \nHere we apply techniques of microfossil biostratigraphy to establish the age of \nmaterials used in the construction of an enigmatic (English Civil War?) defensive \nbuttress at Wallingford Castle in south Oxfordshire, a feature excavated as part of a \nmajor archaeological programme at the town - the Wallingford Burh to Borough \nResearch Project. \nThe town of Wallingford lies adjacent the river Thames to the west of London. \nAlthough the town has its origins in Saxon times, the history of the area (see Airs et \nal., 1975) suggests that the ford, attested to in the town\u201fs name, has been in use \nsince at least the Bronze Age. Finds of Roman coins are known from the general \narea, and an Anglo-Saxon cemetery dating from the 5th to 6th century AD lies to the \nsouthwest of the town. In the late 9th century, as part of a wider strategy to counter \nthe Danish threat, ramparts were raised by the army of King Alfred the Great around \nthe town. After the Norman invasion a castle was built in Wallingford\u201fs north-eastern \n3 \n \nWallingford October 2009 \ncorner in the late 11th century. Further banks and ditches were created around the \ncastle thereby obscuring the line of the nearby section of the earlier town rampart, \nperhaps during the Anarchy of 1139-1153 when Stephen and Matilda were at war, or \nwhen the castle was extended in the 13th century. The castle\u201fs last major role was \nduring the First English Civil War, the last gasp of which came with the Royalist \nsurrender on 27th July 1646, after a siege of 65 days by Parliamentary forces.  \nCastle Meadows now contain the extensive surviving earthworks of the once \nmagnificent Castle, demolished after the Civil War. Figure 1 shows the location of \nthe castle earthworks in relation to the wider town and recent archaeological \nexcavations (the trench under discussion here is marked as \u201e4\u201f on the map). A \nresistivity and magnetometer survey in April 2008 covered the northern part of the \ncastle ramparts and the adjacent low-lying alluvial-deposits bordering the west bank \nof the Thames (Fig. 2), all just outside the outer moat of the castle. Among other \nfeatures, the survey revealed an area (\u201ebastion\u201f) projecting northwards from the \ncastle ramparts to the west of a larger such promontory popularly referred to as \u201cthe \nCivil War bastion\u201d, although this latter is undated. It is the material from the newly-\nidentified bastion that we have analysed using micropalaeontological techniques to \nestablish its provenance.  \n \nARCHAEOLOGICAL CONTEXT OF THE BASTION \nA trench was excavated across the platform of the bastion during the summer of \n2008 (http:\/\/www2.le.ac.uk\/projects\/wallingford_dig_2008). Figure 2 shows the \nlocation of the trench in relation to the results obtained from resistivity survey. The \n4 \n \nWallingford October 2009 \npartially excavated platform was found to be composed of light, variably olive, grey \nfine sandy silt that is very strong and weakly cemented, with some sandy gravel \npreparation layers below. Surrounding the platform was a large artificial depression, \nnow mostly filled in, and thought to be a defensive ditch (though only the near side of \nthe ditch has been revealed through excavation). The top of the platform created a \nlevel floor with some sandy preparation below. The material collected for microfossil \nexamination was from this platform surfacing, which was itself buried under a \nshallow layer of topsoil.  \nApart from tree-root holes and rabbit burrows, no features were found cutting the \nsurface of the platform. Box sections were cut through the platform along the \nnorthern and eastern sides of the trench, revealing it to be about 0.5 metres in depth \nand clearly of artificial construction. Beneath both the platform and the base of the \nditch was a uniform layer of dark brown sandy loam containing mediaeval pottery \n(Fig. 3). This probably represents \u201emade ground\u201f which may have been formed by \nup-cast from the digging of the outer moat of the castle during the mediaeval period.  \nFinds overlying the layer sampled for microfossils were mixed, of 17th- to 19th-\ncentury date with a number of fragments of clay pipes from the earlier to middle part \nof this range. Finds of pottery from the layer underlying the platform have been dated \nas mediaeval. If the platform is taken to have served a military function, which seems \nplausible, then that is assumed to relate to the Civil War siege already mentioned. \nInterpretation of the levelling layer is speculative; but a level defensive platform, \nperhaps a gunnery position, would make sense. Strategically this \u201ebastion\u201f fits \ntopographically with that to the east, and with features of similar appearance \ndetected in the 2009 geophysical survey to the west, towards the town\u201fs north gate, \na focus of assault during the Civil War. \n5 \n \nWallingford October 2009 \nSampling of the bastion construction material was for routine analysis to \ninvestigate the presence of any inclusions such as carbonised cereals, wood \ncharcoal, molluscs, small bone, etc. A two-litre pilot sub-sample was washed-over \nand floated (Kenward et al., 1980) and the residue sifted and allowed to dry before \nexamination under stereoscopic zoom magnification and fossils picked out. Much of \nthe matrix failed to disaggregate, and prolonged soaking in water and then hydrogen \nperoxide was used.  \nSmall quantities of bone, molluscs, a trace of wood charcoal, a few worm ova and \ninsect parts, molluscs, and seeds were recovered. Normally from this type of site un-\ncharred decomposable organic remains such as seeds and insects would be \ndismissed as intrusive. Given the cementation, it seems quite possible that at least \nsome of these finds were trapped at the time of deposition of the sediment. The \nseeds and small fruits were fragile, but identifications were achieved using published \nillustrations (e.g. Cappers et al., 2006) and the botanical reference collection in the \nSchool of Archaeology and Ancient History, University of Leicester. Species \nidentified include: hazel nut, Corylus avellana L.; unidentified thistle, cf. Cirsium sp.; \nblack nightshade, Solanum nigrum L.; fat-hen, Chenopodium album L.; poppy, \nPapaver sp.; unidentified dock, Rumex sp. All were single finds except for fat-hen \nwhich was represented by three seeds.  \nThe presence of seeds and fruits may indicate summer or autumn as the time of \nyear when the sediment was laid down. Although hazel ripens in late August, it can \nbe stored well beyond then for later consumption. The other species are ruderals \nand weeds so their occurrence should be natural.  \n \n6 \n \nWallingford October 2009 \nBIOSTRATIGRAPHIC AGE OF SEDIMENT FROM THE BASTION \nMaterial from the platform has been further examined for its microfossil-content in an \nattempt to provenance its source. The sediment sample from the bastion contained a \nrich microfossil assemblage of ostracods and foraminifera (Plate1 and Appendix). \nThe foraminifera indicate the sediment sample to be of Cretaceous, Cenomanian \nage (Fig. 4). Gavelinella baltica, G. intermedia, G. cenomanica and Hagenowina \nadvena first evolved at the base of the Cenomanian and ranged throughout that \nstage. Hagenowina anglica became extinct in the T. costatus macrofaunal Subzone \n(basal M. rhotomagense macrofaunal Biozone) in the middle Cenomanian. The \nstratigraphically restricted index species Flourensina intermedia is confined to \nforaminiferal Biozone BGS1 (equivalent to the N. carcitanense macrofaunal \nSubzone, basal M. mantelli Biozone). It was accompanied by a single fragment \ntentatively assigned to Bulbophragmium aequale cf. aequale, which supported this \nage determination.  \nA number of the ostracod species present (e.g. Schuleridea jonesiana, Cytherella \novata, Bairdoppilata pseudoseptentrionalis, Homocythere harrisiana, Neocythere \nvanveenae) are biostratigraphically long-ranging taxa of mid-Albian to mid \nCenomanian age. However, others have a more restricted temporal distribution and \nsupport the age assignment established by the foraminifera. Cythereis hirsuta and C. \nthoernensis are known to occur in the Albian in France, but in the UK are found only \nin the latest Albian (perinflatum macrofaunal Biozone) and were more common in the \nlower Cenomanian. Neocythere steghausi also evolved in the Albian, but its \nextinction in the basal part of the N. carcitanense Subzone of the M. mantelli \n7 \n \nWallingford October 2009 \nmacrofaunal Biozone was an important bioevent and useful in dating the sediment \nfrom Wallingford Castle. \n \nPROVENANCE OF THE BASTION MATERIAL \nCenomanian age geological deposits in the neighbourhood of Wallingford comprise \nthe West Melbury Chalk Formation, including the Glauconitic Marl Member at its \nbase (Fig. 4). The Castle site is located on the Glauconitic Marl and materials used \nto construct the platform may have been quarried on site or \u2013 more likely perhaps \u2013 \nto the east of the river where the Glauconitic Marl and West Melbury Chalk form an \nextensive outcrop in the Crowmarsh Gifford area. However, the Glauconitic Marl is \nobscured beneath more recent superficial deposits (Summertown-Radley Sand and \nGravel Member, Northmoor Sand and Gravel Member and the river alluvium) in the \nWallingford area, so that quarrying would have been required. The only place shown \non the geological map for this area where superficial deposits do not cover the \nGlauconitic Marl is to the north of Wallingford Castle (approximately National Grid \nReference SU 608 905). \nAlthough the precise function of the bastion remains uncertain, its stratigraphical \ncontext supports attribution to activity during the English Civil War in the mid-17th \ncentury when the castle was besieged, captured and subsequently destroyed by \nParliamentary forces. During this conflict the defenders of the castle would have \nneeded a reliable and nearby source of sediment to construct durable defensive \nplatforms, some of which may have been used as gun emplacements. The Royalist \noccupiers of Wallingford Castle were fortunate that outcrops of the Glauconitic Marl \n8 \n \nWallingford October 2009 \nwere available nearby and material could have been ferried to the construction site \nfairly easily. When compacted, the Glauconitic Marl forms a durable, almost \u201eroad \nbase\u201f-like medium, making it eminently suitable for defensive works. However, the \nactions of the Royalist \u201egeologists\u201f were ultimately to no avail, as the castle fell to \nParliamentary forces. Indeed, whatever military advantage was intended through \nconstruction of the bastion, there is no clear archaeological evidence that it actually \nplayed a part in any military action.  \nSubsequently, in the 2009 excavation season, more marly deposits used in \nconstruction have been identified (http:\/\/wallingforddig.pbworks.com\/): first \nextensively capping an embankment set back from the original site in Castle \nMeadows; and secondly on the School Playing Field site on the west side of the \nnorth-south running Castle Street, just north of the town ramparts, but here to a \nmuch greater thickness of at least 1.5 metres, apparently used for levelling uneven \nground. The extent of mediaeval and post-mediaeval usage of the Glauconitic Marl \nmay therefore have been much more substantial than the original discovery \nsuggests, and may be illuminated by further investigation.  \n \nCONCLUSIONS \nMicrofossils identify the geological provenance of building materials used in the \nconstruction of a putative Civil War bastion at Wallingford Castle, south Oxfordshire. \nA ready supply of this material, the Glauconitic Marl Member of the West Melbury \nMarly Chalk Formation, was used widely in the area for agriculture and its properties \nmay have been well known locally. The microfossil technique used here has great \n9 \n \nWallingford October 2009 \npotential for establishing the provenance of a range of building materials from \nclassical to early modern contexts. \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  \nExcavations were conducted in Wallingford, south Oxfordshire, in the summer of \n2008 as part of the Wallingford Burh to Borough Research Project run from the \nUniversities of Exeter, Leicester and Oxford supported by an Arts and Humanities \nResearch Council grant.
