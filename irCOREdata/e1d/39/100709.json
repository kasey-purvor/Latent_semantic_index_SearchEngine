Two relaxation times are\ngenerally measured in these 1H NMR experiments: T1, the\nspin-lattice relaxation time, and T2, the spin-spin relaxation\ntime. The T1 is associated with dissipation processes from\nthe spin system through all the other degrees of freedom\n\u0001lattice\u0002. The T2 controls the dephasing within the spin sys-\ntem. These times differ widely for chemically bound hydro-\ngen, hydrogen adsorbed onto surfaces, and hydrogen in wa-\nter confined to small pores. Additionally, the times are\nstrongly influenced by the diffusion of water through large\ninternal magnetic field gradients arising from discontinuities\nin magnetic susceptibilities at pore wall interfaces. The inter-\npretation of relaxation measurements is further complicated\nby paramagnetic species present to some degree in every\ntype of cement.\nThe standard model of relaxation in porous media is de-\nveloped from original work by Brownstein and Tarr \u00031\u0004. Hy-\ndrogen protons diffusing in the pore water occasionally en-\ncounter a pore surface. At the pore surface they are able to\nundergo relaxation. If the rate of diffusion across the pore is\nfast compared to the surface relaxivity, then a single aver-\naged relaxation rate is observed proportional to the pore sur-\nface to volume ratio. If the diffusion rate is slower, and the\nsurface relaxivity is very high, then separate modes are ob-\nserved. In general, for a 3D bulk liquid, the models lead to\nthe prediction that T1=T2.\nThere are already several studies to be found in the litera-\nture that report 1H measurements of T1 and T2 relaxation\nduring the hydration of cements. Multiple relaxation modes\nare normally found. Schreiner et al. \u00032\u0004 discussed a simple\n3-phase model that is been widely adapted to interpret re-\nsults. The three phases are bound water, gel water and cap-\nillary water. Bound water, i.e., water that has chemically\ncombined in calcium silicate hydrate \u0001CSH\u0002 gel, has almost\nno mobility and exhibits long 1H T1 \u0001\u0002100 ms\u0002 and ex-\ntremely short T2 \u0001\u000510 \u0003s\u0002 relaxation times. Water in the\ngel pores is more mobile but the relaxation is heavily domi-\nnated by surface interactions, and so both T1 and T2 are short\n\u00010.5\u20131.0 ms\u0002. The relaxation times of 1H in water in the\nlarger capillary pores are longer but still limited to approxi-\nmately 5\u201310 ms, much less than the bulk liquid times\n\u0001\u00021 s\u0002. Schreiner et al. attributed this to the water being\nsaturated with paramagnetic iron oxides. However, it is now\nmore widely accepted that the capillary water relaxation\ntimes are also dominated by surface interactions. Conse-\nquently, the relaxation times depend on the surface-to-\nvolume ratio of the pores and can therefore reveal the pore\nsize. More complicated 5-phase \u00033\u0004 and 7-phase \u00034\u0004 models\nthat incorporate surface layers of water in the pore structure\nhave also been proposed.\nRecently Korb and co-workers \u00035,6\u0004 considered more\ncarefully the mechanism of the T1 surface relaxivity. They\nproposed that motion of a water molecule across the surface\nconsists of a two-dimensional random walk between binding\nsites characterized by a hopping time \u0004m. The water stays in\nthe vicinity of the surface for a characteristic time \u0004s after\nwhich it leaves the surface and reenters the pore liquid only\nto be replaced by another. Necessarily for the model, \u0004s\n\u0005\u0004m. While the water is near the surface, it undergoes re-\npeated encounters with paramagnetic ions. The resultant\nmodulation of the local dipolar magnetic field created by the\nparamagnetic ions and experienced by the hydrogen nuclei is\nthe primary source of spin relaxation. It is found that the\nrelaxation is strongly frequency dependent at low frequen-\ncies. The strong frequency dependence arises from the very\ndifferent probability of a return to the origin for a random\nwalk in two dimensions compared to a walk in three dimen-\nsions. Korb et al. tested the model by measuring the very low\nfrequency dependence \u0001down to 10 kHz\u0002 of the spin lattice\nrelaxation rate \u0001R1=1\/T1\u0002 using field cycling methods \u00037\u0004.\nIn this work, we use the much easier methodology of\ntwo-dimensional \u00012D\u0002 T1-T2 correlation experiments to fur-\nPHYSICAL REVIEW E 72, 011409 \u00012005\u0002\n1539-3755\/2005\/72\u00011\u0002\/011409\u00019\u0002\/$23.00 \u00a92005 The American Physical Society011409-1\nther test the model and to provide us with additional infor-\nmation on the hydrogen dynamics. These methods are af-\nforded to us through the recent establishment by\nVenkataramanan and co-workers \u00038,9\u0004 of a robust means of\nmaking a two-dimensional inverse Laplace transform; a no-\ntoriously ill-posed problem. These correlation experiments,\nwhich can couple nuclear spin relaxation occurring during\none time period with relaxation or self-diffusion occurring in\na subsequent time period have previously been applied to\noil-bearing rocks \u000310\u201312\u0004, complex fluids \u000313,14\u0004, and food-\nstuffs \u000315\u0004. In oil bearing rocks they are used for the most\npart as an improved means of differentiating between oil and\nwater. In other systems they are used for detailed analysis of\nmicrostructure.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that 2D\nrelaxation correlation methods have been applied to cement.\nAs well as providing further evidence for the verity of the\nsurface diffusion mechanism of relaxation in cements, the\nexperiments yield the first strong evidence of chemical ex-\nchange of hydrogen between pores of different size, critically\nbetween gel pores and capillary pores. The former, although\nnot chemically bound into the solid structure of the cement,\nis nonetheless an integral part of the CSH. Its removal is\ngenerally associated with damage to the delicate CSH struc-\nture. The latter is readily evaporable water in the pore struc-\nture created by shrinkage of the CSH during chemical cure\nand hydration. The objective of much advanced cementitious\nmaterials design is control of the permeability, and hence\ndurability, of the cement by control of the pore structure.\nThat hydrogen can move between the gel and the capillary\npore systems has important implications for developments of\nthis kind. Until now, however, evidence for it has been lack-\ning and it has remained a contested issue in the cement com-\nmunity.\nTHEORY\nSpectral density and T1 \/T2 ratio\nThe observed spin lattice relaxation rate, R1=1\/T1, of\nspins \u0001molecules\u0002 in a liquid filling a porous medium with a\nlarge surface-to-volume ratio, S \/V, is dramatically enhanced\ncompared to the bulk liquid rate by biphasic fast exchange of\nmolecules between pore surface sites and the pore bulk liq-\nuid according to \u00031\u0004\n1\nT1\u0001\u0006\u0002\n=\n1\nT1,bulk\n+\n\u0007S\nV\n1\nT1,Surface\u0001\u0006\u0002\n, \u00011\u0002\nwhere \u0007 is the thickness of the surface layer, assumed to be\nabout the size of a single water molecule and \u0006 \/2\b is the\nNMR frequency. The principal contribution to the overall\nrate comes from the surface term 1\/T1,surface. The problem\ntherefore reduces to evaluating T1,surface, a problem for which\nwe have previously proposed a theory \u00035,6\u0004. The theoretical\nmodel supposes that a large number of proton \u0001spin I\u0002 bear-\ning molecules such as water are diffusing at or close to a\nsolid surface with a surface density \t of fixed paramagnetic\nimpurities \u0001Fe3+\u0002. The proton spin relaxation is primarily due\nto the modulation of the dipole-dipole interactions between\nthe I and S spins brought about by the translational diffusion\nof the I spins past the fixed relaxation sinks, S. This is pos-\nsible first because the gyromagnetic ratio of the electron, \nS,\nis much larger than that of the proton, \nI \u0001\nS=658.21\nI\u0002, and\nsecond because there are numerous molecular reencounters\nbetween the I and S spins under conditions of a two-\ndimensional random walk. There are far fewer reencounters\nin three dimensions. The model develops two correlation\ntimes associated with the probe molecule dynamics at the\nsurface. One is the surface residence time, \u0004s, for probe mol-\necules encountering the surface. It depends upon the exis-\ntence of bonding sites for the probe molecule on the surface\nand is limited by molecular desorption. The other is the\ntranslational correlation time, \u0004m, associated with individual\nmolecular jumps of adsorbed molecules which diffuse across\nthe surface. A schematic visualization of the molecular sur-\nface motion is presented in Fig. 1.\nThese considerations lead, after some lengthy calculations\nfully detailed elsewhere \u00035,6\u0004, to expressions for the spectral\ndensity functions for the motion JL\n0,1,2\u0001\u0006\u0002 and thence to an\nexpression for T1,surface\u0001\u0006\u0002. The theory predicts that the 1H\nspin-lattice relaxation rate is linear in two parts when plotted\nas a function of the logarithm of the magnetic field strength\nand the slopes of these distinct linear regions should be in the\nratio of \u000110\/3\u0002. The theoretical predictions follow closely the\nexperimental frequency dependencies of 1 \/T1 observed with\nfield cycling proton relaxometry of various liquids confined\nin calibrated porous media \u00035\u20137\u0004. These theoretical predic-\ntions have also been observed in cementitious materials dur-\ning progressive hydration \u000316\u0004.\nUsing the notation of our previous work \u00035,6\u0004, we now\ntake the general expression for the transverse and longitudi-\nnal relaxation rates \u000317\u0004,\n1\nT1,surface\n=\n2\n9\n\nI\n2\nS\n2\u000b2S\u0001S + 1\u0002\u0003JL\n0\u0001\u0006I \u2212 \u0006S\u0002 + 3JL\n1\u0001\u0006I\u0002\n+ 6JL\n2\u0001\u0006I + \u0006S\u0002\u0004 \u00012\u0002\nand\nFIG. 1.

In particular it is independent of all\nparameters such as the surface density of paramagnetic spe-\ncies \u0001\t\u0002 and the distance of minimum approach \u0001\f\u0002 used in\nthe derivation of Eq. \u00013\u0002.\nFigure 2 shows a plot of the calculated dependence of the\nratio of the two relaxation times as a function of the dimen-\nsionless variable \u0006I\u0004m for three different values of the ratio\n\u0004m \/\u0004s from 10\u22122 to 10\u22124. It is worthwhile to note that the\ninverse ratio \u0004s \/\u0004m describes the number of molecular steps\nat the solid surface. The figure clarifies how the relaxation\ntime ratio decreases dramatically from unity for two-\ndimensional diffusion. In our experiments, \u0006I \/2\b\n=20\r106 Hz and previous estimates suggest \u0004m\u000e1.3\n\r10\u22129 s16, thus giving a value \u0006I\u0004m\u000e0.16. Hence, from Fig.\n2, we can predict a range from 0.25 to 0.50 for the expected\nvalue of the ratio T2 \/T1 as shown by the vertical dotted line.\nCross relaxation\nIn the absence of exchange, the time dependence of the\nmagnetization data arising from a T1-T2 correlation experi-\nment is described by\nM\u0001t1,t2\u0002 = M0\u000f \u000f P\u0001T1,T2\u0002\u00101 \u2212 2 exp\u0006\u2212 t1T1 \u0007\u0011\n\rexp\u0006\u2212 t2T2 \u0007dT1dT2, \u00016\u0002\nwhere P\u0001T1 ,T2\u0002 is the required T1-T2 distribution that is\nfound by the two-dimensional inverse Laplace transform.\nNuclear spin cross relaxation can occur as a result of chemi-\ncal exchange, spin-diffusion and dipolar interactions. It\nmodifies the observed relaxation rates. The general argu-\nments have been well rehearsed in the literature.

We have\nthen inverted this data. In general, it leads to four peaks in\nthe 2D relaxation correlation spectrum. These are expected at\nlocations \u0001s1\n+\n,s2\n+\u0002, \u0001s1\n+\n,s2\n\u2212\u0002, \u0001s1\n\u2212\n,s2\n+\u0002, and \u0001s1\n\u2212\n,s2\n\u2212\u0002. In practice the\ndiagonal peaks occur where expected although the off-\ndiagonal peaks are slightly shifted. We attribute this to the\ninverse Laplace transform and note that the one-dimensional\nsimulated data presented by Hills et al. shows a similar small\ndiscrepancy. Notwithstanding this limitation, under realistic\nconditions, one of the peaks is generally of negligible inten-\nsity, that at \u0001s1\n\u2212\n,s2\n+\u0002. Under conditions of slow exchange \u0001R\n\u0005k\u0002, just two peaks are observed, at \u0001s1+ ,s2+\u0002 and \u0001s1\u2212 ,s2\u2212\u0002\nwhile under conditions of very rapid exchange \u0001k\u0005R\u0002 a\nsingle peak is observed at a weighted average location.\nIn the case of a T2-T2 experiment, Eqs. \u00018\u0002\u2013\u000111\u0002 still apply\nexcept that Ra2=1\/T2a, Rb2=1\/T2b, ka2 and kb2 all act in both\nthe first and second encoding periods so that\nma\u0001t1\u0002 =\n\u0001s2\n\u2212 + Ra2 + ka2\u0002Ma\n0\n\u2212 kb2Mb\n0\ns2\n\u2212\n\u2212 s2\n+ exp\u0001s2\n+t1\u0002\n+\n\u0001s2\n+ + Ra2 + ka2\u0002Ma\n0\n\u2212 kb2Mb\n0\ns2\n+\n\u2212 s2\n\u2212\nexp\u0001s2\n\u2212t1\u0002 \u000112\u0002\n\u0001with a complementary equation for reservoir b\u0002.The inher-\nent symmetry of the T2-T2 experiment ensures that the two\noff-diagonal exchange peaks have equal intensity. However,\nin a practical implementation of the experiment as described\nin the next section, a longitudinal storage period may be\nintroduced between the two T2 encoding intervals. This pe-\nriod, \u0004delay, serves to clearly demarcate between the two en-\ncoding intervals. During the storage, T1 relaxation with ex-\nchange occurs. The introduction of \u0004delay serves to break the\nsymmetry of the experiment so that the two off-diagonal\npeaks are no longer necessarily equal. The relevant equations\ncan be written down by extension of the foregoing analysis\nto three exchange periods leading to Ma\u0001t1 ,\u0004delay , t2\u0002 and so\nforth although this is not done here as the expressions\nquickly become unwieldy.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nKetton white cement, obtained from Castle Cement,1 was\nused in all the samples. Small, carefully measured amounts\nwere mixed in the water to cement ratio of 0.4 and cast in\ncylindrical moulds 10 mm in diameter and 20 mm deep. The\nsamples were cured for 24 h in a high humidity environment\nbefore being removed from the moulds and placed in stan-\ndard 10 mm NMR tubes. The first measurement \u0001day 1\u0002 was\nmade immediately. Thereafter, a small quantity of water was\nadded so as to just cover the samples allowing them to cure\nunderwater. They were stored at 20 \u00b0C. Prior to subsequent\nmeasurements the added water was removed, the outside of\nthe sample gently dried with absorbent paper and the sample\nreturned to a clean, dry NMR tube. The excess water was\nreplaced after the measurement. Several repeats of the\nsamples were prepared. A second series of samples with\nadded silica fume was also made. These samples incorpo-\nrated microsilica obtained from Elkem2 equal to 10% by\nmass of the cement.\nThe ESR spectrum of a white cement sample was ac-\nquired using a Bruker spectrometer operating at 9.6 GHz in\norder to confirm the presence at low level of residual Fe3+\nand Mn2+ paramagnetic ions. In order to quantify the ion\ncontent of the cement using the spectrum, a small single\ncrystal of CuSO4 with a precisely measured mass was incor-\nporated into the dry sample.\nThe basic 2D NMR relaxation correlation method is well\ndocumented in the literature \u000310,11,13\u201315\u0004 although there are\nnumerous variants upon it. The experiment consists of two\nparts during which the two dimensions are encoded.

The index i, the power to which the constant \u000e is\nraised, is increased from 0 to n\u22121 over the n repeats of the\nprimary sequence enclosed in square brackets. Similarly, the\nindex j is increased from 0 to m\u22121 over the m repeats of the\necho sequence part of the sequence in round brackets. The\ninversion recovery interval and the echo pulse gap are there-\nfore both increased logarithmically so as to span a very wide\nrange of time intervals. The complex data sets are rotated to\nprovide the T1 inversion recovery in the \u201creal\u201d channel and\nthe echo intensities from the CPMG measurements are re-\ncorded. In this way the experiment yields a two-dimensional\nn\rm data set encoding T1 in the first dimension and T2 in\nthe second. The time \u0004RD is the repetition interval delay to\nallow full recovery of the magnetization between measure-\nments.\nIn the experiments reported here, n=50 and m=64. The\ntiming parameters are \u00041=100 \u0003s, \u00042=34 \u0003s, and \u0004RD\n=1.0 s, with \u000e=1.2068 and \u000f=1.1351. Accordingly, t1i\n=\u000ei\u00041, t2j =\u0012k=0\nj 2\u000fk\u00042. Hence the inversion recovery interval\nspans 0.1 to 1000 ms and the echo decay spans\n0.068 to 1680 ms. Each data set was averaged 128 times re-\nsulting in a total acquisition time of 5 h.

The interval \u0004delay\ndescribes a period of longitudinal storage of the magnetiza-\ntion which serves to clearly separate the first and second\nencoding period.\nThe Laplace inversion was performed using the method\ndevised by Venkataramanan, Song, and Hurlimann \u00038\u0004 with\nsoftware made available to us by Song. Others have made\ngrowing use of this method in recent years and there is now\na sufficient body of literature experience that gives us con-\nsiderable confidence in it. Nonetheless, we have performed\ninversions of simulated data with varying amounts of added\nwhite noise. Our experimental data has a signal-to-noise ratio\nat least equal to 400 to 1. Analysis of simulated data of\nsimilar form to that recorded experimentally suggests that\nthis is entirely adequate to have confidence in the features\nobserved and conclusions reached even if, as already noted,\nsome of the off-diagonal features are slightly shifted. In ana-\nlyzing the intensity of the smaller features, white noise was\nrepeatedly added to the real data at a similar level to the\nexperimentally observed noise. The inversion was repeated\neach time and the average and standard deviation of the re-\nsultant parameters evaluated.\nRESULTS\nFigure 3 shows an ESR spectrum recorded from a white\ncement sample at room temperature. It confirms the presence\nnot only of Fe3+ ions, but also a small quantity of Mn2+ ions.\nUsing the CuSO4 crystal, we estimate 4.46\r1018 Fe3+ ions\/g\nand a negligible quantity of Mn2+. The surface area of the\nwell resolved hyperfine structure of Mn2+ is in fact very low\ncompared to the large surface area of the nonresolved ESR\nspectra of Fe3+. Moreover, these results have been confirmed\nby chemical analysis that gives 95 and 5% relative contribu-\ntions for Fe3+ and Mn2+, respectively.\nFigure 4 shows the raw NMR T1-T2 data set recorded\nfrom a sample of white cement that had been allowed to\nFIG. 3.

The manner in which the T1 inversion\nrecovery and the T2 decay are encoded in the first and second\ndimension is readily apparent. The plot demonstrates the ex-\ncellent signal to noise ratio\u2014in excess of 400 to 1\u2014obtained\nin this experiment, a fact that greatly improves the stability\nof the inverse Laplace transform. Figure 5 shows the result\nof the 2D inverse Laplace transformation of this data set. The\nprincipal features are as follows: there is a series of five\npeaks aligned along a diagonal. The two of these with the\nshortest relaxation times, of the order of 200 \u0003s and 2 ms,\nrespectively, account for most of the intensity in the distri-\nbutions; the other three are at longer relaxation times and are\nconsiderably smaller. All the peaks, but particularly the\nsmaller ones, are well separated and discrete with approxi-\nmately 1 order of magnitude in relaxation time between\nthem. The second observation is that the diagonal features\nare, in fact, shifted slightly down from the principal diago-\nnal, T1=T2, aligned instead along T1=4T2. There is a single\noff-diagonal feature. Its position is close to that expected of a\ncross-peak connecting the two principal diagonal features. It\nis of low intensity but is highly reproducible having been\nseen in many experiments. Finally in regard to this data, we\nnote that of course there is no symmetric feature above the\ndiagonal.\nFigure 6 contains a time series of plots that show the\nevolution of the T1-T2 correlations over the first 14 days of\nhydration for both the white cement paste \u0001the same series\nfrom which Fig. 5 is extracted\u0002 and the cement paste with\nadded silica fume. The plots shown are for the samples after\n1, 2, 7, and 14 days of curing. Three observations are made.\nFirst, the diagonal peaks in the silica fume paste are not as\ndiscrete as they are in the white cement paste. By day 14,\nthey form an almost continuous ridge across the plot. Sec-\nond, the off-diagonal peak drifts noticeably toward longer T1\ntimes as the reaction proceeds. The vertical dotted lines\nacross the plots are at T1=10 ms and provide a good guide\nagainst which this phenomenon can be seen. Third, and in so\nmuch as this can be gauged from the plots, the reaction pro-\nceeds more quickly in the silica fume paste compared to the\nwhite cement paste. For instance, the shift in the off-diagonal\nfeature already noted is not fully apparent until day 14 in the\nwhite cement. However, in the silica fume paste, the shift is\nalready starting to occur on day 2. Equally, the smaller diag-\nonal features appear for the first time at day 4 in the white\ncement paste \u0001Fig. 5\u0002 but are already apparent on day 2 in the\nsilica fume paste.\nThe final correlations discussed here are shown in Figs. 7\nand 8. These are the results of T2-T2 correlation experiments\nwith delay interval of \u0004delay=2 and 10 ms between the two\nhalves of the experiment, respectively. The former \u0001Fig. 7\u0002 is\nrecorded from a white cement paste after just one day of\nhydration, the latter \u0001Fig. 8\u0002 after 4 days. The most important\nfeatures of Fig. 7 are the two off-diagonal features placed\nsymmetrically about the true diagonal, T2\n1\n=T2\n2\n, together with\nthe two associated diagonal features completing a \u201csquare\u201d\nin the lower left of the figure. This is consistent with expec-\ntation for a T2-T2 correlation experiment with a short \u0001ideally\nzero\u0002 longitudinal storage interval. The peak at longest T2 in\nthis plot, in the upper right, is surprisingly displaced above\nthe diagonal. One possible reason for this is diffusion of\nwater through magnetic susceptibility field gradients as dis-\ncussed in the next section. Turning to Fig. 8, three diagonal\nfeatures are seen. Continuing a trend begun in Fig. 7, the\nupper two are now strongest, the lower one relatively weak.\nFIG. 5. The T1-T2 correlation spectrum of a white cement\nsample cured for 4 days.

PHYSICAL REVIEW E 72, 011409 \u00012005\u0002\n011409-6\nThis is due to the interval \u0004delay, which filters short T1 com-\nponents. The effect is accentuated because the sample is\nolder, the average T1 is decreasing. Nonetheless, all three are\nagain well centered on the true diagonal T2\n1\n=T2\n2 rather than\non a line parallel to the diagonal. A small but reproducible\nsingle off-diagonal peak remains at the position of a lower\ncross peak for the lower two diagonal peaks. There is no\nsymmetric peak on the upper side of the diagonal, presum-\nably due to the storage interval breaking the symmetry of the\nexperiment.\nDISCUSSION\nEach of the discrete features along the diagonal of plots\nsuch as those in Figs. 5\u20138 corresponds to water in a different\npore size environment. The existence of gel pores on a scale\nof some 20 \u00c5 is well known in cement. The relaxation of\nwater within these is assigned to the primary feature with the\nlowest relaxation time. The T1 of circa 200 \u0003s is consistent\nwith previous \u00011D\u0002 measurements of T1 in similar cement\npastes at similar NMR frequencies \u000318\u0004. All the other fea-\ntures \u0001with the exception of that at the longest T1 relaxation\ntime on the order of 3 s which is seen in some measure-\nments\u0002, are attributed to the relaxation of water in capillary\npores of increasing size as one moves up the diagonal.\nClearly, the largest fraction is associated with a T1 some 10\ntimes longer than that of the relaxation time associated with\ngel water. This, too, is consistent with previous analyses.\nMultiple discrete modes have been observed previously in\none-dimensional relaxation experiments, this analysis makes\nthem particularly clear. The small component with the very\nlong relaxation time is attributed to a layer of residual bulk\nwater \u0001used to prevent water loss during storage\u0002 remaining\non the sample surface after they have been dabbed dry. In-\nterestingly, it lies on T1=4T2.\nAt first sight, the fact that multiple discrete capillary pore\nsize modes can be distinguished is somewhat surprising as\nmost conventional analyses, e.g., by mercury intrusion poro-\nsimetry, suggest a continuous distribution in cement. How-\never, detailed atomic force microscopy studies of hydrating\ncements do offer supportive evidence of structure at different\ndiscrete length scales \u000319\u0004 as does an alternative NMR based\nmethod of measuring pore size distributions, NMR cry-\noporometry \u000320\u0004. According to the Gibbs-Thompson equa-\ntion, the melting point of liquids confined to small pores is\ndepressed compared to that of the bulk liquid by an amount\ninversely proportional to the pore size. Milia et al. also\nshowed that the freezing point of water in cements is depen-\ndent on the pore size \u000321\u0004. Valckenborg et al. \u000322\u0004 measured\nthe pore size distributions in mortar samples via both cry-\noporometry and relaxometry. The measurements indicated\nthree nominal pore sizes, although the shape of the distribu-\ntions was different in the two techniques. It now seems clear\nthat NMR methods that directly probe pore water, albeit in\nvery different ways, repeatedly report a distribution of dis-\ncrete pore sizes in hydrating cement whereas other more con-\nventional analyses report a continuous distribution. These\nother techniques\u2014not least mercury porosimetry\u2014are gen-\nerally more invasive than NMR and may be destroying the\nfiner details of the structure in the course of the analysis.\nEqually, most of them are sensitive to the size of the pore\nthroat rather than the pore itself and these dimensions are\nunlikely to be the same.\nAll the experimental evidence in this study suggests that\nT1\u000e4T2 in the cement pastes studied.

The T2-T2 correlation spectrum of the white cement\nsample cured for 1 day recorded with a longitudinal storage interval\nof 2 ms. The spectrum is very similar to the T1-T2 spectra except\nthat the primary features now all lie along the principal diagonal:\nT2\n1\n=T2\n2\n. Also, off-diagonal peaks are now seen symmetrically placed\nboth above and below the diagonal so forming a \u201csquare\u201d in the\nlower left of the plot. This is the primary evidence presented that\nthe off-diagonal feature in the previous plots is due to exchange of\nmagnetisation between different environments rather than, e.g., due\nto chemically bound water. The fact that the peak at longest T2 in\nthe top right is above the diagonal is likely an artefact, perhaps\nassociated with diffusion of water through susceptibility gradients.\nThe intensity contours \u0001arbitrary units\u0002 are equally spaced up from a\nzero base.\nFIG. 8.

This observation is offered as strong sup-\nportive evidence for the validity of the surface diffusion\nmodel of relaxation. We note that, reviewing the literature,\nother earlier results can now be explained. In particular,\nHurlimann and Venkataramanan \u000310\u0004 reported 2D T1-T2\nmeasurements for Indiana limestone and showed a long di-\nagonal feature spanning more than 2 orders of magnitude in\nrelaxation time which was interpreted as a broad and con-\ntinuous distribution of pore sizes. A detailed examination\nshows that this distribution is shifted down from the T1=T2\nline to nearer T1=2T2. Such a result is explicable in terms of\nsurface diffusion dominated relaxation. Also, Korb et al. \u000323\u0004\npreviously made measurements of the \u00011D\u0002 relaxation times\nof simple liquids confined to model microporous systems.\nT1 \/T2 ratios as great as a factor of 10 were observed.\nThe existence of an off-diagonal feature in T1-T2 correla-\ntions could be attributed to hydrogen in a solidlike environ-\nment, for instance hydrogen chemically combined into the\ncement, especially as T1\u0005T2 for the experimentally ob-\nserved feature. We discount this possibility for two reasons.\nFirst, the observed T2 of the off-diagonal peak is substan-\ntially longer, by almost an order of magnitude, than that nor-\nmally reported for bound hydrogen in cement. Second, and\nmore fundamentally, we see the off-diagonal peaks also in\nthe T2-T2 correlations. Bound hydrogen along with all the\nrest would give rise to a diagonal feature in this experiment\nin the absence of any exchange mechanism. Rather, we at-\ntribute the off-diagonal peaks to a chemical exchange of hy-\ndrogen \u0001water?\u0002 between pores of different sizes. An off-\ndiagonal peak corresponds to hydrogen magnetization in the\npore environment associated with the T1 \u0001or T2\u0002 of the verti-\ncally connected diagonal feature exchanging with hydrogen\nmagnetization in an environment associated with the T2 of\nthe horizontally connected diagonal feature. Such a situation\narises if the proton moves between two pore sizes on the\ntimescale of the measurement: chemical exchange. Since the\noff-diagonal features link diagonal peaks corresponding to\ncapillary and gel pore water, we infer transfer of hydrogen\n\u0001water?\u0002 between the capillaries and the gel. We believe that\nthis is the first time that evidence for such a capillary-gel\ninteraction has been presented. The fact that corresponding\npeaks indicative of transfer the other way \u0001gel to capillary\u0002\nare not seen the other side of the diagonal in the T1-T2 ex-\nperiments is reassuring, but is not evidence that it does not\noccur. Such a peak would require T1\u0010T2 which is not physi-\ncally possible. The magnetization coherence required for a\nlong T2 cannot be maintained once magnetization has re-\nturned to the longitudinal direction and once it has already\ndephased in a small pore environment. Additionally, since\none might expect transform artefacts to be symmetrically\ndispersed around the diagonal, the absence of a cross peak on\nthe upper diagonal side further suggests that the observed\npeaks are genuine.\nFigure 9 shows the intensity \u0001integrated peak volume\u0002 ra-\ntio of the off-diagonal feature compared to the principal two\ndiagonal features. In the case of the white cement there is no\nclear trend in this ratio, it remains largely constant through-\nout. In the case of the silica fume paste it decreases system-\natically during the first few days of curing. This likely re-\nflects detailed differences in the evolving microstructure and\nperhaps that there is less water available for exchange in the\ncapillary pore reservoir in the silica fume paste.\nThe experiments using white cement with added silica\nfume show an earlier onset of features than those with pure\nwhite cement. The silica fume vastly increases the available\nsurface area on which the cement hydration reactions can\noccur and consumes the lime produced in those same reac-\ntions that normally inhibits the production of the CSH gel.\nThis results in an acceleration of the curing. The NMR evi-\ndence from this study is that it disrupts the pore size distri-\nbution of the developing larger pores so as to create a more\ncontinuous distribution. It also appears to reduce the ex-\nchange of water between gel and capillary pores appreciably\nas curing proceeds. This could well be a consequence of the\nmodified pore structure.\nA careful study of the principal diagonal features shows\nan evolution of shape as the sample cure proceeds. Presum-\nably changing shape reflects a changing pore structure envi-\nronment and evolving \u0004m, although this has not yet been fully\ninterpreted. Features to be explained include the fact that the\ndiagonal gel pore peak is slightly angled across the T1=4T2\ndiagonal and that it has a tendency to fall slightly above this\ndiagonal, perhaps at T1=2T2. One possibility is that this is a\ndirect result of the more regular, better defined two dimen-\nsional lamellar structure of the gel pores compared to the\nmore irregular capillary pores.\nOur analysis so far has ignored the effects of attenuation\nof magnetisation coherence during T2 encoding by diffusion\nof water through the internal magnetic field gradients of the\nporous structure. Such gradients necessarily exist due to the\ndifferent magnetic susceptibilities of the matrix and pore wa-\nter. For a CPMG experiment with constant pulse gap \u0004 ap-\nplied in a constant magnetic field gradient, the effective T2 is\ngiven by \u000324\u0004\nFIG. 9. The ratio of the exchange peak intensity to the total\ndiagonal intensity as measured from T1-T2 correlation spectra such\nas those in Fig. 6 as a function of sample curing time for both a\nwhite cement sample \u0001solid squares\u0002 and a white cement sample\nwith added silica fume \u0001open circles\u0002.\nMCDONALD et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW E 72, 011409 \u00012005\u0002\n011409-8\n1\nT2\n*\n=\n1\nT2\n+\n1\n3\n\n2G2\u00042D \u000113\u0002\nwhich in the limit of small \u0004 or G tends to the \u201ctrue\u201d value.\nMitigating against this being a serious problem more widely\nin our experiments is the fact that we use a relatively low\nNMR frequency and hence applied magnetic field. Suscepti-\nbility gradients scale with field strength and the attenuation\ndepends on the square of the gradient strength. Also, we use\nwhite cement: the paramagnetic impurity density is relatively\nlow limiting the susceptibility difference across the pore wall\ninterface. Elsewhere \u000310\u0004, in studies of rock, others have\nused very many echoes with a small constant pulse gap.\nHowever, the \u0004 used was not that small and would not have\naccessed the gel water as we have done with a minimum \u0004 of\n30 \u0003s. Also, there are problems with recording a very large\nnumber of echoes. First, the magnetization can spin-lock\nalong the applied pulse field direction so that the measured\nT2 is closer to the spin lattice relaxation time in the rotating\nframe Second the applied radio frequency energy can heat\nthe sample and hence accelerate curing in a long experiment.\nThird, the volume of data recorded can become exceedingly\nlarge. For all of these reasons we chose to systematically\nincrease the pulse gap throughout the echo train. Exactly\nhow this impacts on the data is unclear although it may have\na bearing on some of the finer details of the experimental\nresults. For instance, one manifestation may be the position\nof the peak in the upper right of Fig. 7, the peak is noticeably\ndisplaced from the diagonal to a position above the diagonal.\nThe fact that this is a T2-T2 experiment on a young sample\nmay be relevant as diffusion selectively affects T2 and the\nsample is less mature and therefore has more mobile water.\nCONCLUSION\nWe have made the first T1-T2 and T2-T2 2D nuclear spin\nrelaxation correlation measurements of cement pastes. These\nexperiments have provided the first clear evidence for chemi-\ncal exchange of water protons between gel and capillary\npores and have also provided further evidence in support of\nthe two-dimensional surface diffusion model of spin relax-\nation in cements. Differences between white cement paste\nand white cement paste with added silica fume have been\nobserved which reflect current understanding of the different\nmicrostructures.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors thank Y.-Q.
