Introduction 1 \nOn site ex situ techniques such as windrow turning and biopiling rely on the management 2 \nof the biodegradative potential of microorganisms to render hydrocarbons less toxic 3 \nthrough mineralisation, biotransformation and assimilation (Barr, 2002). A benefit of 4 \nbioremediation is the broad scope of petroleum fuel compounds amenable to the process, 5 \nincluding branched and unbranched chain aliphatic and aromatic compounds (Chatterjee 6 \net al., 2008). Using windrow turning, a site contaminated with high concentrations of 7 \ndiesel range organics (DRO, C6-C24) was remediated from an initial TPH concentration of 8 \n10,000 mg kg\n-1\n to less than 1,000 mg kg\n-1\n within six months (Barr, 2002).  9 \n 10 \nIn this study the petroleum hydrocarbon was No. 6 fuel oil (referred to as bunker C fuel 11 \noil) a grade of residual fuel for marine engines. Bunker C has been reported to be the 12 \nleast susceptible to biodegradation in a study carried out by Walker et al., (1976) where 13 \nthe biodegradation of two crude and two fuel oils were compared. However in a large-14 \nscale study, Comeau et al. (1991) reported the successful biological treatment of 21,475 15 \nm\n3\n of bunker fuel contaminated soil within 12 to 14 weeks under active management. 16 \nInitial TPH concentrations of 6,000 mg kg\n-1\n decreased to less than 1,000 mg kg\n-1\n during 17 \nthat study. This observation is in contrast with Song et al., (1990) who reported that 18 \nbioremediation of bunker C was very slow and incomplete and that the initial steady rate 19 \nof degradation ceased after 8 weeks. It was concluded that some bunker C constituents 20 \nwere structurally resistant to biodegradation. 21 \n 22 \n 4 \nWindrows require the frequent turning of soil to enhance aeration, homogenise pollutant 1 \nsources, nutrients and degraders and to accelerate bioremediation. Biopiles require forced 2 \naeration and often use complementary suction of soil gas to feed air to the microbial 3 \ncommunity. Both are managed under similar regulatory frameworks and can be 4 \nconducted on site but they require careful water management to optimise the degradation 5 \nrate. Continuous monitoring of soil hydrocarbon concentration, oxygen level and 6 \nqualitative and quantitative microbial community changes commonly complement 7 \nmanagement strategies (Chatterjee et al., 2008). To assess bioremediation as an active 8 \nprocess, a measure of the number of hydrocarbon degraders present in a sample is 9 \nrequired. Despite moving towards molecular approaches, there is still a great reliance 10 \nupon culture based techniques including most probable number (MPN) and simple colony 11 \nforming unit enumeration (CFU) (Coulon et al., 2004; Masak et al., 2003). Larger 12 \nmicrobial populations have been correlated with enhanced rates of bioremediation 13 \n(Lindstrom et al., 1991).    14 \n 15 \nSoil ecotoxicity assays are based upon direct measurements of soil attributes and enable a 16 \nrapid and real-time assessment of changes in the soil processes as a function of remedial 17 \ntreatment adopted (Paton et al., 2006). Microbial assays commonly used as indicators of 18 \nhydrocarbon contamination include microbial biomass measurements (CFU, MPN, 19 \nPLFA), microbial community diversity, function, size species response, and soil 20 \nrespiration (Delistraty, 1984; Van Beelen and Doelman, 1997; Phillips et al., 2000; 21 \nCoulon et al., 2004). Such measurements serve to complement the enumeration of 22 \nhydrocarbon degraders. 23 \n 5 \n 1 \nTo monitor changes in the hazard of remediating soils, plant bioassays have been 2 \ncommonly adopted either for plant growth or seed germination (Molina-Barahona et al., 3 \n2005). When considering soil organisms, earthworms are used because they are sentinel 4 \nsoil test organisms (Callahan et al., 1991; Dorn and Salanitro, 2000). Ecological 5 \nmeasurements enable an empirical evaluation of hazard assessment and the interpreted 6 \nresponse indicates the cumulative impact of potential harm in the soil (Dawson et al., 7 \n2007). Dawson et al (2007) acknowledged the complexity of interpreting the response of 8 \na battery of assays and proposed a ranked approach to selecting the most suitable method. 9 \nIn the UK, and increasingly across the world the end-point of remedial activity is defined 10 \nnot by the total concentration of the chemical of concern but by the concentration likely 11 \nto pose significant risk. The use of human derived risk-derived approaches can be related 12 \nto the intended end use of a given site and the target concentration to protect the target 13 \nreceptor is adopted accordingly (Khan and Hussain, 2001).  14 \n 15 \nFor this study, risk assessment of each hydrocarbon fraction was carried out using the risk 16 \nbased corrective action model: RISC4. The default parameters used were for a toddler 17 \n(residential) and adult (workplace) receptors and criteria were defined as pass or fail for 18 \neach fraction. There are three approaches that are often adopted in defining the remedial 19 \ntargets for a site. These are: general action concentrations (GAC) soil clean-up target 20 \nlevels (SCTL) and site specific assessment criteria (SSAC). GAC are derived using 21 \nlargely generic assumptions about the characteristics and behaviour of contaminants, 22 \npathways and receptors and apply to a range of sites. SCTL are back calculated risk 23 \n 6 \nacceptable concentrations, but often generic. Where circumstances relevant to a specific 1 \nsite scenario and receptor behaviour define the SSAC.  2 \n 3 \nThe aim of this work was to compare the performance of two bioremediation techniques 4 \n(windrows and biopiling) on bunker C Fuel oil impacted soils at the field scale. 5 \nIndividual treatments were compared and assessed using hazard and risk criteria 6 \nassociated with the soil. Furthermore the aim was to consider at what point soil may be 7 \ndeemed to be remediated and how different clean-up treatments compared in meeting 8 \nthese end-points. 9 \n 10 \n2. Material and Methods  11 \n2.1. Regularly applied techniques 12 \n2.1.1. Site set up, sampling and sample preparation 13 \nSoil (40 tonnes) was collected from a contaminated Bunker fuel site located at a former 14 \ndockyard in eastern Scotland. Soil was pre-screened through a >20mm sieve and field 15 \nscreening was conducted to ensure that there was no co-contamination with heavy metals 16 \nand metalloids (with a Niton 700 XRF multi-element analyser). Basic  soil 17 \ncharacterisation was performed (pH, bulk density loss on ignition, extractable N and P 18 \nconcentration) as Guicharnaud et al., 2009. For the experiment, duplicate 3 tonne masses 19 \nof soil were set up as either windrows or biopiles. These were constructed to have a 2.5 20 \nm\n2\n base and were tapered in a pyramidal shape to a peak ogf 1.4 m.  Bulked amendments 21 \nwere applied (nutrients and inocula, nutrients alone or no enhancement) using a six tonne 22 \ncapacity hybrid agricultural silage mixer hydraulically powered by a tractor. Nutrients 23 \n 7 \nwere added in the form of ammonium nitrate and potassium orthophosphate to obtain a 1 \nC: N: P ratio of 100: 20: 2. The inocula, supplied by Remedios Limited (Aberdeen), was 2 \nan attenuated enrichment culture from No.6 oil impacted soil and the cell concentration 3 \nadded was such as to give 5x10\n7\n CFU g\n-1\n soil. After further mixing by a Bobcat 4 \nexcavator, the treatments were split into two replicates. A control soil was set up which 5 \nwas left fallow with no enhancement or physical remedial action. The windrows were 6 \nturned twice a week. All treatments and the fallow soil were maintained at between 70 % 7 \nand 80 % of their maximum water holding capacity. Air was pumped into the biopiles in 8 \na 48 hour cycle to prevent oxygen limitation. Samples were collected from each windrow 9 \ntreatment every two weeks for a period of 28 weeks. Microbial counts were made after 0, 10 \n4, 10, 16, 22 and 28 weeks. A strict sampling protocol was adhered to: five replicate 11 \nsamples were taken from across each soil treatment, each of these individual replicates 12 \nbeing composed of homogenised composite bulked 500 g samples.  Prior to analysis 13 \nsamples were stored at 4 \n\u00ba\nC and analysis were performed on representative soils after the 14 \nbulked replicates had been coned and quartered. Analysis was always carried out within 15 \neight days of sampling. For other analysis, the samples were collected and bulked at the 16 \nstart, mid-point (12 weeks) and end of the experiment (28 weeks).  All biological and 17 \nchemical analysis was performed on the five independent replicates for each biopile or 18 \nwindrow at each sample time described. 19 \n 20 \n2.1.2. Total hydrocarbon determination 21 \nHomogenised soil (5 g) was ground with anhydrous Na2SO4 and the sample placed in a 22 \n50 ml glass centrifuge tube. Dichloromethane (DCM)\/acetone solution (1:1, 20 ml) was 23 \n 8 \nadded to the sample and sonicated for 30 minutes (applied energy on soil 1 \nsuspension=1200 J ml\n\u22121\n). Samples were then placed on an end-over-end shaker for 16 2 \nhours at 60 rpm then centrifuged at 1750 x g at 4\n \u00ba\nC for 20 min. After phase separation 3 \nwith water to remove the polar fraction, a 10 ml aliquot of DCM\/acetone extract was 4 \ncollected and added to 40 ml glass Wheaton vials and the sample concentrated under N2 5 \ngas. The sample was then suspended in 4.9 ml of hexane and sonicated for 2 minutes. 6 \nAfter the addition of copper turning (0.5 g), a squalane standard was added as an internal 7 \nstandard. Analysis was performed by GC-FID as described by Dawson et al. (2007). 8 \n 9 \n2.1.3. Basal respiration 10 \nBasal respiration was determined as described by Paton et al. (2006). Briefly, 2 g of 11 \nhomogenised soil were weighed into gas vacuettes and allowed to stand for 6 hours in an 12 \nincubator at 25\n \u00ba\nC. A sample of headspace from the vial was injected into the GC 13 \ninjection loop (250 \u03bcl) system with a nitrogen carrier gas (20 ml min\u22121) onto a 80\/100 14 \nmesh Poropak Q column (2 m \u00d7 1\/8\u2033OD\u00d72 mm). The oven temperature (Chrompack CP 15 \n9001) remained constant at 100 \n\u00ba\nC and the FID temperature was set at 250\n \u00ba\nC. Respiration 16 \nvalues were determined on a mg CO2 g soil\n-1\nday\n-1\n basis following subtraction of a blank 17 \nvial containing atmospheric CO2 only. 18 \n 19 \n2.1.4. Determination of culturable heterotrophs and hydrocarbon-degraders  20 \nHomogenised soil (2 g) was weighed into a glass Universal bottle and 20 ml of \u00bc 21 \nstrength Ringer\u2019s solution was added. Samples were then vortexed for 30 seconds and 22 \nsonicated for 1 minute and allowed to stand for a further 2 minutes. A 100 \uf06dl aliquot of 23 \n 9 \nsoil suspension was removed and serially diluted in \u00bc strength Ringer\u2019s solution to the 1 \nappropriate dilution factor (10\n-5\n or 10\n-4\n dilution factor). An aliquot of 10 \uf06dl of each 2 \ndilution series was added in triplicate to \u00bc strength Luria Bertani medium to determine 3 \nheterotrophs and Bushnell-Hass with 1 % diesel as the sole carbon source for 4 \nhydrocarbon-degraders. No 6 Fuel oil was unsuited as a substrate due to the viscous 5 \nnature of the material. Samples were incubated at 25 \n\u00ba\nC for 24 - 48 hours thereafter and 6 \ncolony-forming units (CFUs) enumerated. Results are expressed as CFU g\n-1 \nof dry soil. 7 \n 8 \n  9 \n 10 \n2.2. Techniques conducted at the start, mid-point and termination of the experiment 1 \n2.2.1. Fractionated hydrocarbon (H-C) analysis 2 \nThe extraction procedure and GC-FID analysis settings for fractionated hydrocarbon 3 \nfractions have been previously described by Risdon et al. (2008). Briefly, 5 g of soil was 4 \ndried with 5g of anhydrous sodium sulphate (Na2SO4) and spiked with 1 mL of a solution 5 \ncontaining o-terphenyl (oTP), squalane (Sq), heptamethylnonane (HMN) and 2-6 \nfluororbiphenyl (2-Fb) at a concentration of 200 \u00b5g ml\n-1 \neach in acetone. Soil samples 7 \nwere extracted with 4 ml of acetone and sonicated for 2 minutes at 20\u02daC. Hexane and 8 \nacetone were added to the samples to achieve a 1:1 ratio. The samples were sonicated for 9 \na further 10 minutes followed by manual shaking (twice) then followed by centrifugation 10 \nfor 5 minutes at 1000 x g. After passing the supernatant through a filter column, a 11 \nsequential step series (including resuspension of samples in 10 ml of acetone: hexane 12 \n(1:1), sonication for 15 minutes at 20 \u02daC, centrifugation for 5 minutes at 1000 x g and 13 \nthen decanted into a filter column, this was performed and repeated twice). The final 14 \nextract volume was adjusted to 40 ml with a mixture of acetone: hexane (1:1) before 15 \nanalysis. A silica gel column was used to separate the aliphatic and aromatic fractions. 16 \nApproximately 80 ml of RO water and a spatula of sodium chloride (baked at 400\u02daC for 4 17 \nhours) were added to the extracts partitioning out any acetone into the water and ensuring 18 \nthe removal of the non-polar content. The split of the aliphatic\/aromatic fractions was 19 \nachieved by eluting with 3 ml of hexane followed by 3 ml of DCM, respectively.  20 \n 21 \nH-C content was quantified using a gas chromatograph fitted with a flame ionization 22 \ndetector (GC-FID Agilent 7890). Quantification of H-C and sub-ranges of hydrocarbons 23 \n 11 \n(Table 1) was made by integrating peak areas using Agilent Chemstation Software 1 \nRevision B.01.01 (164) SR1 (2001-2005), and by comparison against refined mineral oil 2 \nstandards. External multilevel calibrations were carried out for both diesel\/mineral oil 3 \nfractions and surrogates, quantification ranging from 0.5 to 2500 \u00b5g ml\n-1\n and from 1 to 5 4 \n\u00b5g ml\n-1\n, respectively.  5 \n 6 \n2.2.2. Bioluminescence microbial biosensor assay 7 \nA methanol extract was used to extract bioavailable H\u2013C for use in the bacterial 8 \nbiosensor assays; 2 g of soil (dry weight) was extracted with 4 ml methanol (Bundy et al., 9 \n2004). The biosensor Escherichia coli HMS174 (Selifonova & Eaton, 1996) was used to 10 \nmeasure the change in concentration of inducible hydrocarbon (as reflected by 11 \nisopropylbenzene, (Selifonova and Eaton, 1996). The toxicity of the soil extracts was 12 \ndetermined using 2 constitutively marked biosensors Pseudomonas putida F1 Tn5 and 13 \nEscherichia coli HB101 pUCD607 (Paton et al., 2006).  14 \n 15 \nCells for each of the assays were previously freeze-dried using standard procedures 16 \n(Bundy et al., 2001) and stored at -20 \n\u00ba\nC.  All standards and extracts were diluted to 5 % 17 \nmethanol prior to analysis (Paton et al, 2009). Cells were resuscitated in 10 mL 0.1 M 18 \nKCl between 30-60 minutes on an orbital shaker at 200 rpm and 25 \n\u00ba\nC before being 19 \nsequentially aliquotted (0.1 ml cell suspension) into 0.9 ml of test sample. All procedures 20 \nwere carried out in 1.5 ml covered glass cuvettes and time exposure for the constitutive 21 \npromoted sensors and inducible sensor was 30 and 120 minutes, respectively. A reference 22 \ncontrol for Escherichia coli HMS174 was prepared by adding 2.8 \uf06dl of isopropylbenzene  23 \n 12 \nIPB) to 100 ml deionised water containing 0.4 ml methanol. All bioassays were carried 1 \nout in triplicate, with a total volume of 1 ml and light output was measured using a Jade 2 \n(Bio orbit 1251) portable luminometer. Results were expressed as a percentage of this 3 \npostitve reagent control. 4 \n 5 \n2.2.3. Seed germination assay 6 \nFor this assay, 10 mustard seeds (Brassica alba) were added separately in 5 replicates to 7 \n120 ml wide mouth glass jars containing 20 g of soil re-wetted to 75% WHC. Lids were 8 \nloosely screwed on to reduce evaporation but allow aeration and the seeds were left to 9 \ngerminate at 25 \n\u00ba\nC, 80 % humidity and no light for 4 days. The number of seeds 10 \ngerminated was recorded after 4 days. A non-contaminated control soil (Boyndie), 11 \nmaintained at 44% (v\/w), was used as the baseline to obtain a 100 % recovery in the 12 \nassays.  13 \n 14 \n2.2.4. Earthworm assays 15 \nLumbricus terrestris were obtained from worms direct. Five replicate earthworms were 16 \nexposed to 50 g of soil sample in 120 ml wide mouth glass bottles for 14 days (Dawson et 17 \nal., 2007; Shakir Hanna & Weaver, 2002). Before and after exposure, the earthworms 18 \nwere washed in tap water and placed in a plastic container lined with moist tissue paper 19 \nto depurate overnight. Individual earthworms were then rinsed, dried, weighed and placed 20 \nin a glass jar containing 50 g of soil re-wetted to 80% WHC.  Earthworms were incubated 21 \nindividually for 14 days at 15 \n\u00ba\nC, 80 % humidity and no light. Lids were fitted loosely to 22 \nminimise evaporation but allow aeration. The control soil was Boyndie. Earthworms were 23 \n 13 \nexamined on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10 and 14 for lethality. Sublethal effects were assessed by 1 \nmeasuring the mass of the earthworms after exposure and then depuriating using standard 2 \ntechniques as per Callahan et al (1991.) 3 \n 4 \n2.3. Risk assessment derived remedial targets 5 \nFractionated H-C measurements were interpreted in a risk derived framework using the 6 \nrisk based corrective action model: RISC4 to compare the estimated and the obtained 7 \nvalues (RISC4 Manual). Default parameters were used for toddler (residential) and adult 8 \n(workplace) receptors. 9 \n 10 \n2.4. Data analysis  11 \nData analysis was performed using the five independent replicates for each biopile or 12 \nwindrow at the stated timepoints described. Analysis of the treatments however were only 13 \nassessed by considering the duplicate treatment data which represents the replication at 14 \nthe field scale. The H-C concentration, culturable heterotroph and degrader numbers were 15 \nanalysed by one-way ANOVA (following where appropriate log transformation of data) a 16 \nnon-parametric Mood median test was used as the alternative. Pearson correlation 17 \ncoefficients and where appropriate multiple linear regression equations were calculated to 18 \ndetermine which parameters explained the most variation in the chemical and biological 19 \nresponses (i.e. H-C concentration, heterotroph number, degrader number and ecotoxicity 20 \ntests). Results in this study represent mean and standard error of two independent 21 \nreplicates (for treatments) but for individual determinants and corresponding bioassays 22 \nfive replicates for comparative evaluation of techniques was performed. A multiple linear 23 \n 14 \nregression was performed to assess the relationship between hydrocarbon fractions, time, 1 \ntreatments and toxicity response.  Significance is expressed at p < 0.05. All analyses were 2 \nconducted using MINITAB (Release 15). 3 \n 15 \n 1 \n3. Results   2 \n 3 \n3.1 General soil attributes 4 \nThe pH range of the soil remained between 6.0 and 7.0 for (optimal range for H-C 5 \ndegradation (Vidali, 2001) the duration of the experiment regardless of the treatment 6 \n(data not shown) and this is amenable to an active hydrocarbon degrading microbial 7 \npopulation (Atlas, 1981).  The bulk density of the biopile treatments remained constant 8 \nthroughout the duration of the study (0.93 g cm\n-3\n) but was significant reduced for the 9 \nwindrow treatments (0.78 g cm\n-3\n) (further data not shown). 10 \n 11 \n3.2 Total hydrocarbon determination 12 \nAfter 30 weeks, the total extractable petroleum hydrocarbon content in windrow 13 \ntreatments, including windrow, windrow with nutrients and windrow with nutrients and 14 \ninocula, were reduced to 4%, 3% and 2%, respectively of their initial value (Figure 1). In 15 \ncontrast, extractable TPH in biopile treatments were only reduced to 22% of their initial 16 \nvalues (Figure 2). The results reveal that biostimulation and bioaugmentation enhanced 17 \nthe decrease in TPH concentration throughout the duration of the experiment.  The 18 \ncontrol values as represented by the fallow treatment decreased  by only 19% during the 19 \nfield scale experiment. 20 \n 21 \n 16 \n3.3 Basal Respiration  1 \nRespiration values collected throughout the experiment for the windrow and biopile 2 \nremediation study are shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4, respectively. Relative to the other 3 \ntreatments, the control had a significantly lower respiration value throughout the 4 \nexperiment. However, both the nutrient alone and nutrient and inocula treatments with 5 \nboth windrow and biopile management resulted in a significant increase (p < 0.05) in 6 \nrespiration. The highest CO2 production was reached during the first the first 5 and 12 7 \ndays in windrow and biopile treatments, respectively. Throughout the study the windrow 8 \ntreatments had significantly higher respiration values (up to 0.8 mg CO2 g\n-1\n soil) than the 9 \nbiopile ones (up to 0.4 mg CO2 g\n-1\n soil). 10 \n 11 \n3.4 Total culturable heterotroph and degrader numbers 12 \nThe number of culturable heterotrophs in both windrows and biopile treatments generally 13 \ndecreased by one order of magnitude with time (Table 1). In contrast, the number of 14 \nhydrocarbon degraders increased at least by one order of magnitude regardless the type of 15 \ntreatments (Table 2). 16 \n 17 \n3.5 Fractionated hydrocarbons analysis 18 \nFractionation of the oil residues showed that the most prominent aliphatic and aromatic 19 \nfractions were C12 - C35 and C16 - C35, respectively (Tables 3). Overall, windrow 20 \ntreatments out competed biopile treatments. Degradation of the aliphatic and aromatic 21 \nfractions in windrows was 6 and 4 times higher respectively than the biopile ones after 6 22 \nweek of treatment. Nutrient addition and bioaugmentation of the biostimulated windrows 23 \n 17 \nled to a 2 fold higher degradation rate of the aliphatic fraction whereas the aromatic one 1 \nwas barely enhanced by the treatments (Table 3). Higher degradation rates were 2 \nregistered for the aliphatic fraction followed by the aromatics. The mass fraction of 3 \naromatics relative to aliphatic hydrocarbons increased by more than 20% in windrows 4 \nwhereas in biopile the mass fraction remained nearly the same. 5 \n 6 \n3.6 Bioluminescence microbial biosensor assay 7 \nResponse of the constitutive biosensor Escherichia coli HB101 pUCD607 in both 8 \nwindrow and biopile treatments increased by more than 40% and 55%, respectively 9 \nduring the experiment (Table 4a). This trend was also observed for Pseudomonas putida 10 \nF1 Tn5 and the controls. In contrast, response of the inducible sensor, Escherichia coli 11 \nHMS174 (Table 4b), showed that the luminescence decreased over time, indicating a 12 \nreduction in the concentration of the target analyte or metabolites to this biosensor. The 13 \nresults are expressed as the percentage of the maximum inducible luminescence from a 14 \nsaturated sample of isopropyl benzene. It has been shown that this biosensor is responsive 15 \nto a wide range of analogues of this compound and these results do not reflect a reduction 16 \nin the concentration of this specific analyte. In general, the results ranged between 15 \u2013 17 \n20% luminescence at the start of the experiment to 1.4% or less luminescence at the end 18 \nof the experimental time. 19 \n 20 \n3.7 Seed germination assays 21 \nThe control sample germination rate at the start of the experiment increased to double 22 \nthat rate at the end of the experimental time (Table 5). Windrow control and windrow 23 \n 18 \nwith nutrients had a similar increased germination rate as the control, while windrow with 1 \nnutrients and inocula had about triple the increase in germination rate of the control. For 2 \nthe biopile treatments, a lower increase in seed germination rate was observed for both 3 \nbiopile and biopile with nutrients. Biopile with nutrients and inocula had tripled in 4 \ngermination rate at the end of the experiment. 5 \n 6 \n3.8 Earthworm assays 7 \nAt the end of the experiment, there was significantly greater survival than at the start of 8 \nthe treatment or the mid point (Table 6). The windrow treatments resulted in a lower 9 \nsurvival counts compared with the control with the windrow with nutrients and inocula 10 \nhaving the lowest results. For the biopile treatments, the survival rate was different from 11 \nthe windrow treatments compared with the control. Biopile and biopile with nutrients had 12 \na significant increase in survival counts. The biopile with nutrients and inocula also had a 13 \nsmall increase in survival at the end of the experiment. 14 \n 15 \n3.9 Risk assessment derived remedial targets 16 \nBy the end of the experiment, the results obtained from the fractionated analysis in the 17 \nsoil (Table 3) were compared to that in the RISC 4 criteria and a pass \/ fail mark was 18 \ngiven to each fraction and treatment. An overall risk assessment (RA) mark was awarded 19 \nto indicate if the site had passed the criteria at that time point (Table 7). 20 \n 21 \n4. Discussion 22 \n 19 \nSong et al. (1990) in a study of the biodegradation of bunker oil reported that it took 48 1 \nweeks of incubation to degrade fifty percent of TPH even under optimal nutrient 2 \nconditions. It was reported that most of the bunker oil components were structurally 3 \nresistant to biodegradation and they concluded that \u201cbioremediation has only very limited 4 \nbeneficial effects on bunker oil elimination from soil\u201d.  5 \nIn this study, the amendment of treatments with nutrients increased significantly the 6 \nhydrocarbon degradation at the initial stages of the experiment.  This was further 7 \nincreased at the initial stages by the addition of the inocula. It may be inferred, as many 8 \npapers report, that the microbial population in the control soils was nutrient limited but 9 \nthat there was a capable microbial population present (Atlas, 1981; Coulon et al. 2004; 10 \nBamforth and Singleton, 2005; Delille and Coulon, 2008). 11 \n  12 \nIn the control soil, the indigenous population was capable of degrading the available 13 \nhydrocarbon without any further treatment, but the rate was slower and hence there is a 14 \nrequirement for the remediation management team to relate the need for speed of 15 \ndegradation with the cost of amendment (Khan et al, 2004). Throughout the study the 16 \ndegrader numbers were higher than the total heterotrophic numbers. This is contrary to 17 \nthe observation of Adako and Orugbani (2007) who reported a corresponding increase in 18 \nheterotrophic and petroleum degrading bacteria during hydrocarbon degradation. 19 \nHowever, the effective remediation management (aeration, sieving and nutrients) could 20 \nhave liberated additional substrates (mainly hydrocarbons) and resulted in an increase in 21 \nthe total bacterial population (Townsend et al., 2000). It has been documented that 22 \nculturable heterotrophic numbers can decrease in fuel oil amended soils (Turco et al., 23 \n 20 \n1995) as a response to physical and chemical changes to the soil which may affect 1 \naeration and nutrient diffusion.  2 \n 3 \nRespiration has been identified as a key indicator of bioremediative activity (Diplock et 4 \nal., 2009). In this study, by week 28, the nutrient treatment for both the windrow and 5 \nbiopile techniques was observed to have the highest respiration rate corresponding with 6 \nan increased number of hydrocarbon degraders. This could be a result of a shift in the 7 \nassimilation efficiency of the cells due to the addition of nutrients and hence the change 8 \nof the metabolic quotient. Alternatively, it could be simply that a higher cell number 9 \ncorrelates with increased degradation (Coulon et al., 2004; Margesin et al., 2007). 10 \n 11 \nA measure of the luminescence of biosensors is a surrogate for metabolic activity of soil 12 \nbacteria (Steinberg et al., 1985; Bundy et al., 2004). This may be used to assess the 13 \nburden of pollution on the potential metabolic activity of key soil organisms and this may 14 \nin turn aid in decision making for bioremediation (Trott et al., 2006; Dawson et al., 15 \n2007). Dawson et al. (2008) compared the response of a constitutive and monoaromatic 16 \nhydrocarbons induced biosensor in a site contaminated with benzene, toluene, ethyl 17 \nbenzene and xylenes. The results are similar to those in this study, in that the decline in 18 \nhydrocarbon concentration caused a reduction in bioluminescence of the induced sensor 19 \nwhile the constitutive sensor increased in bioluminescence. Bundy et al. (2001) also 20 \nnoted that at the start of the remediation activity, the presence of more water soluble 21 \nintermediates caused an increase in toxicity and this was also evident in this study.  22 \n 23 \n 21 \nThe other ecotoxicity assays suggest recovery as the total hydrocarbon concentration 1 \ndeclines. This finding is supported by previous studies including Dawson et al., (2007) 2 \nwho reported the indicators that differentiated the extent of soil remediation were 3 \nrespiration, earthworm toxicity and mustard seed germination. Salanitro et al. (1997) 4 \nreported that bioremediated soils were neither toxic to earthworms, inhibitory in the 5 \nMicrotox assay, nor deleterious to seed germination after months of treatment.  6 \n 7 \nAlthough the response of the biosensor correlated both with that of the earthworms and 8 \nseed germination there was little linkage to the human risk assessment criteria. One of the 9 \nkey problems is determining the point at which recovery has been met or where hazard is 10 \ndeemed acceptable and then relating this to risk derived criteria. While LD50 and EC50 11 \nvalues are often used, these may be insensitive to predicting ecological protection. 12 \nFurthermore NOEC and LOEC values require considerable data sets for accurate 13 \nestimations and in light of the nature of these experiments this may not be practicable 14 \n(Dawson et al., 2007). In the case of the most effective treatments (as assessed by 15 \ndegradation) there was a considerable improvement on the recovery of the ecotoxicity 16 \nassays (Dawson et al., 2007; Salanitro et al., 1997). This could be interpreted, in the 17 \ncontext of this study, to mean that the hazard assessment criteria were such that the soils 18 \nwere all acceptable (regardless of treatment) at the end time point.  19 \n 20 \nThere is no doubt that a measure of the TPH could be misleading as it is the component 21 \nfractions of the hydrocarbon that will pose a hazard or potential risk to defined receptors. 22 \nIn the case of this study, despite exhaustive regression analysis no single fraction could 23 \n 22 \nbe deemed as the causal agent for the measured ecotoxicological response (TPHCWG. 1 \n1998). In part this could be because the adopted banding may not reflect the relative 2 \nsensitivity of the receptors under investigation (TPHCWG. 1998). These fractions are not 3 \nindividual compounds and there is very limited dose response characterisation of these 4 \nreceptors used to the fractions measured. Furthermore, these fractions do not occur in 5 \nisolation and it is difficult to factor out the relative impact of these grouped compounds. 6 \nThe discipline as a whole will benefit from consideration of fractions and their dose 7 \ndependency responses to relevant soil ecotoxicity assays. It should also be remembered 8 \nthat polar metabolites that may be more bioassimilable and potentially more toxic than 9 \nthe non polar hydrocarbons particular are likely to remain undetected in this study 10 \n(TPHCWG. 1998). 11 \n 12 \nHydrocarbon fractions are however, widely used in human risk assessment. Placed in the 13 \ncontext of human risk assessment, fractionation quantification reveals an interesting 14 \npattern relative to treatment adopted. At the end-point for GAC only WN passes while for 15 \nSSAC values W, WN and WNI all pass the criteria (Table 7). This means perhaps that 16 \ndepending on the selection of an ecotoxicity acceptable dose factor, the risk to a toddler 17 \nfrom ingesting soil is greater than the hazard derived from earthworm, seed germination 18 \nand biosensor applications to the soil itself. Each receptor has a different response to the 19 \nsubstance of interest.  20 \n 21 \nIn the future, comparative evaluations of defined receptors will become more important, 22 \nbecause although the risk assessment models exist to protect humans and water courses 23 \n 23 \nunder a range of different conditions, this is not the case with ecological receptors. There 1 \nis currently a need to carry out empirical assays to quantify the response and then 2 \nconsider using these data to derive ecologically protective doses. 3 \n 4 \nHazard and risk approaches are key in defining the status of soil in the context of being 5 \n\u201cfit for purpose\u201d. Such approaches are of more meaning than a total hydrocarbon 6 \nmeasurement and may also place the relative potency of fractions in a suitable context.  7 \n 8 \n5. Conclusion 9 \nActive management enhanced the biodegradation of bunker fuel oil in soil in a controlled 10 \nfield-scale trial. The addition of nutrient and inocula accelerated the degradation rate for 11 \nthe period of the study. Microbial measurements used in conjunction with chemical 12 \nanalysis increased our understanding of field-based bioremediation. For this heavily 13 \ntextured soil, windrow turning was more effective than biopiling because the resultant 14 \nsoil was more friable. For coarser textured soils, biopiling may perform better. The likely 15 \ndecision as to which technique to adopt would be determined by remediation managers. 16 \nThe end-point of remediation needs to be defined relative to the receptor that requires 17 \nprotection. In this study, soil that showed a significant ecological recovery was still 18 \nimpaired with respect to human risk criteria and visa versa. There is a need to carry out 19 \nmore comparative studies to better assess the relationship and relative sensitivity of 20 \nreceptor-based end-points. 21 \n 22 \n 24 \nAcknowledgements This work was supported by the LINK Bioremediation programme 1 \n(BIOREM_35) and funded by the Department for Business Innovation and Skills (BIS) 2 \n(formerly the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR) and previously the Department 3 \nof Trade and Industry (DTI)), the Environment Agency of England and Wales (EA) and 4 \nthe Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council BBSRC (Grant 5 \nBB\/B512432\/1). 6 \n 7 \n  8 \n 25 \nReferences 1 \nAdoki, A., Orugbani, T., 2007.
