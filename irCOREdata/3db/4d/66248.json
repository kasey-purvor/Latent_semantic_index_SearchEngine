Tailoring wave packets in Rydberg systems [1],\nproducing single photons on demand [2], creating coherent\nsuperpositions of macroscopic persistent-current states [3],\nand controlling the production of multiparticle entangle-\nment [4], are prominent examples of \u2018\u2018quantum state en-\ngineering.\u2019\u2019 Although almost perfect control has been\nachieved over these systems, this can rapidly lose effi-\nciency when influenced by decoherence or noise. Addition-\nally, generic features of strongly coupled quantum systems\nallow for novel and often robust strategies of quantum\ncontrol. In such cases, studied in much detail in the area\nof quantum chaos, peculiar eigenstates emerge which ex-\nhibit unexpected localization properties and dynamics, and\nare remarkably inert with respect to uncontrolled perturba-\ntions. Prominent examples are nondispersive wave packets\nin periodically driven quantum systems [5], quantum reso-\nnances [6,7], and stochastic web states [8,9]. These \u2018\u2018strong\ncoupling\u2019\u2019 quantum control schemes rely on underlying\nclassical dynamics, which in general is mixed regular\nchaotic [10]. For such a picture to be meaningful it is in\ngeneral necessary to approach the semiclassical limit\nwhere the classical actions accumulated along typical\neigenmodes of the system are large compared to @. The\nquantum system can then \u2018\u2018resolve\u2019\u2019 the intricate phase\nspace structure of classically mixed regular-chaotic dy-\nnamics, and classical nonlinear stabilization phenomena\nemerge on microscopic scales.\nOne of the most ubiquitous of such stabilization phe-\nnomena in nonlinear classical dynamics is mode locking.\nEigenmodes of a periodically driven dissipative system are\nlocked in their time evolution onto the phase of an external\ndrive through a nonlinear resonance phenomenon. It occurs\nin applications ranging from frequency-stabilized lasers\n[11] to plasma confinement in fusion reactors [12]. An\nimportant question is: is this necessarily strictly a classi-\ncal\/semiclassical effect? We report that features of mode\nlocking occur at the quantum level even far from the\nsemiclassical limit. This was achieved using quantum ac-\ncelerator modes (QAMs) of cold atoms kicked by a pulsed\nstanding wave of light orientated along the Earth\u2019s gravi-\ntational field [13]. In this Letter we show that the modes\nobserved in these experiments can be classified according\nto a number-theoretic construction known as the Farey tree\n[14].\nWe commence by describing the experimental system\nwhich forms the basis of our analysis [13]. To create\nquantum accelerator modes in the laboratory, laser cooled\ncesium atoms are exposed to a sequence of equally spaced\npulses from a standing wave of light which is far detuned\nfrom the nearest atomic transition. Because of the ac Stark\neffect, the atoms experience each \u0001-function like pulse as a\nsinusoidal potential (spatial period \u0002=2) proportional to the\nintensity of the light. A QAM is characterized by a mo-\nmentum transfer, to a substantial fraction of the atoms,\nwhich increases linearly with the number of pulses.\nFigure 1 shows the momentum of the atomic ensemble as\na function of pulse period T with the accelerator modes\nhighlighted by the labeled curves [13]. The inset plots the\nmomentum distribution of a \u00011; 0\u0002 QAM as a function of\nthe number of pulses. Note how the width and amplitude of\nthe accelerator mode (the peak which moves to the left)\nremain relatively unchanged and the center momentum\nincreases linearly with pulse number. This can be con-\ntrasted with the peak near zero momentum which broadens\nPRL 96, 164101 (2006) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending28 APRIL 2006\n0031-9007=06=96(16)=164101(4)$23.00 164101-1 \u00a9 2006 The American Physical Society\nas pulses are applied. Although the stability of the accel-\nerator mode from pulse-to-pulse is already somewhat remi-\nniscent of mode locking behavior, there are other reasons\nto think of the accelerator mode in this way.\nTo see this, we examine the atomic center-of-mass dy-\nnamics using the one-dimensional \u0001-kicked accelerator\nHamiltonian H^ \u0003 p^2=2m\u0004mgz^\u0005 @\u0003d\u00061\u0004 cos\u0001Gz^\u0002\u0007 \bP\nn\u0001\u0001t\u0005 nT\u0002 [15]. Here z^ is the vertical position, p^ the\nmomentum, m the atomic mass, g the gravitational accel-\neration, t the time, G \u0003 4\u0004=\u0002 [16], and \u0003d \u0003 U0tp=2@,\nwhere U0 is the maximum ac Stark shift in the standing\nwave and tp is the pulse duration. The special resonant\nvalues of T in the vicinity of which QAMs occur experi-\nmentally are Tl \u0003 2\u0004lm=\u0001@G2\u0002 \u0003 l\b 66:7 \u0005s, with l any\nnon-negative integer. Hence, \u0006 \u0003 2\u0004l\u0001T=Tl \u0005 1\u0002 is a small\nparameter. Translating to a frame accelerating with g, to\nremove the linear potential, and taking the limit \u0006 ! 0 the\nquantum dynamics of the kicked atoms can be modeled by\nthe classical map [17]:\nJn\u00041 \u0003 Jn \u0005 K sin\u0001\u0007n\u0002 \u0005 sgn\u0001\u0006\u00022\u0004\u0001; (1a)\n\u0007n\u00041 \u0003 \u0007n \u0004 sgn\u0001\u0006\u0002Jn\u00041 mod\u00012\u0004\u0002; (1b)\nwhere sgn\u0001\u0006\u0002 is positive (negative) if the pulse interval T is\ngreater (smaller) than Tl, and\n\u0007 \u0003 Gzmod\u00012\u0004\u0002; (2a)\nJn \u0003 In \u0004 sgn\u0001\u0006\u0002\u0006\u0004l\u0004 \b\t\u0005 2\u0004\u0001\u0001n\u0004 1=2\u0002\u0007; (2b)\nwith p=@G \u0003 I=j\u0006j \u0004 \b, K \u0003 \u0003dj\u0006j, \u0001 \u0003 gGT2=2\u0004, and\n\t \u0003 2\u0004lT=Tl. Note that the deeply quantum mechanical\ncharacter of the atomic dynamics remains hidden in the\nparametrization of Eqs. (1) and (2) through the quasimo-\nmentum \b, 0 \t \b< 1, since the limit \u0006 ! 0 leading to the\nclassical Eqs. (1) leaves the finite value of @ unaffected. By\nBloch theory, subspaces of different quasimomenta are\ndecoupled.\nMode locking enters the theory of QAMs via Eq. (1)\nwhich also describes the deterministic motion of a periodi-\ncally kicked classical particle on a circle. In this case \u0007n\nand Jn are the angle and angular momentum just before the\nnth kick, K is the kicking strength, and \u0001 the unperturbed\nwinding number. If the classical particle is additionally\nsubject to dissipative forces, the accessible phase space\nshrinks, and Eq. (1) reduces (in the long-time limit) to the\nsine-circle map [18]: \u0007n\u00041 \u0003 \u0007n \u0005 K sin\u0001\u0007n\u0002 \u0005 2\u0004\u0001, a\nparadigm in the study of mode locking. If K \u0003 0 and \u0001\nis a rational number m=p, any trajectory of the sine-circle\nmap returns to its initial value (modulo 2\u0004) after p iter-\nations. For 0<K < 1, mode locking is observed; over a\nrange of \u0001 values aroundm=p (the mode locking interval)\na periodic trajectory with rational winding number m=p\npersists. This orbit attracts all other orbits asymptotically\nin time, such that finally all have this winding number. The\nwidths of the mode locking intervals are exponentially\nsmall in p, and increase with increasing K up until K \u0003\n1. The regions thus formed in (\u0001; K) parameter space,\nterminating at K \u0003 0, \u0001 \u0003 m=p, are known as Arnol\u2019d\ntongues [19].\nUsing this formalism, it is now possible to analyze the\ndynamics of the QAM in the \u0006 ! 0 limit. To begin we look\nfor stable periodic orbits in Eq. (1) such that, if (J0; \u00070) is\non an order p orbit, after p pulses Jpmod\u00012\u0004\u0002 \u0003 J0. If the\norbit is stable, then each of the p points it is composed of is\nsurrounded by a nonlinear resonance island, set in a chaotic\nsea, where the motion is predominantly regular; the motion\nin the island system approximates that of the periodic orbit.\nIf the orbit has winding number m=p, then Jp \u0003\nJ0 \u0004 2\u0004m. Thus, from Eq. (2), In (and therefore pn) grows\nlinearly with time. The islands travel in momentum, result-\ning in acceleration. If a wave packet is launched within an\nisland surrounding a stable periodic orbit, the acceleration\nof the corresponding QAM obeys\npn \u2019 p0 \u0004 n 2\u0004j\u0006j\n\u0001\n\u0001\u0005m\np\n\u0002\n@G; (3)\nprecisely as observed in the inset of Fig. 1. Hence, we can\nidentify QAMs with nonlinear resonance islands in the\nclassical phase space generated by Eq. (1). This is just\nanother manifestation of the general mode locking phe-\nnomenon we are describing here. These islands are robust\nstructures, as guaranteed by the Kolmogorov-Arnol\u2019d-\nMoser (KAM) theorem [20]. A quantum wave packet\ninitially prepared in the island travels with it, and decays\nonly slowly by tunneling into the chaotic surroundings. For\nsufficiently small \u0006, this tunneling is exponentially weak,\n126 130 134 138 142\n\u221260\n\u221240\n\u221220\n0\n20\n40\n60\nPulse Period    (\u00b5s)\nM\nom\nen\ntu\nm\n (2\n ph\noto\nn r\nec\noil\ns)\n(c)\n(a)\n(c) 0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n\u221250 0 50\n0\n10\n20\n30\nmomentum (2 photon recoils)\nn\nu\nm\nbe\nr o\nf p\nul\nse\ns\n(d)(e)\nT\n(b)\nFIG. 1 (color online).

More importantly, due to the\nKAM theorem the island itself is rather inert with respect\nto perturbations of the Hamiltonian generating the map\nEq. (1). This robustness is inherited by the QAMs and\nshields them against experimental noise [5].\nIn Fig. 2 we plot a \u2018\u2018phase diagram\u2019\u2019 to represent the\nregions (tongues) where stable periodic orbits with differ-\nent values of (p;m) are numerically observed in the (\u0001; K)\nparameter plane. This plot contains the parameter space\nexplored experimentally [13] using values of T in the\nvicinity of T2 \u0003 133:3 \u0005s. Close to K \u0003 0, each of the\nstable periodic orbit regions is wedge-shaped, with its\nvertex at \u0001 \u0003 m=p, K \u0003 0. Moving to higher K inside a\ntongue, the periodic orbit eventually turns unstable. A\nsequence of bifurcations follows, which breaks the tongue\ninto fragments. Fragments of different tongues intertwine\nand overlap in complicated ways. A tongue may be over-\nlapped by others even before breaking, and such overlaps\npersist even at quite small values of K.\nUsing a canonical perturbation theory [20\u201322] to deter-\nmine an existence condition for a stable periodic orbit for\nEq. (1) with a given (p;m), one obtains, jKj> 2\u0004 \u0003\u0003\u0003pp j\u0001\u0005\nm=pj. In the form of an equality, this equation accurately\nbounds the wedge-shaped (p;m) tongue near its vertex.\nThis is shown for the \u000121; 8\u0002 and \u00015; 2\u0002 periodic orbits by\ndashed lines in Fig. 2. Numerical computation and scaling\nconsiderations reveal the \u2018\u2018critical region\u2019\u2019 where a tongue\nbreaks to be roughly located at kicking strengths K \n\n2\u0004p\u00053=2 [22]. Thus, the higher the period of an orbit, the\nnarrower the corresponding tongue, and the lower the\n\u2018\u2018critical value\u2019\u2019 of K at which the tongue begins to break.\nThe parameters corresponding to a specific experiment\ndetermine a point in the phase diagram. If this point is\ninside a tongue then a QAM may be observed. At fixed\npulse number n, Eq. (3) defines a curve of enhanced\npopulation in the (T; p) plot (seen in the data of [13]\npresented in Fig. 1), due to the presence of the (p;m)\nQAM. We explore the phase diagram of Fig. 2, keeping\nboth \u0003d and n constant, while varying T. This procedure\nvaries \u0006, K and \u0001. The results of such an experiment are\nshown in Fig. 1. The locus of the experimentally explored\npoints in the phase diagram is a curve shown by the dotted\nline in Figs. 2 and 3. This curve hits the K \u0003 0 axis at \u00010 \u0003\ngGT2l =2\u0004, the value of \u0001 corresponding to the exactly-\nresonant value of the kicking period T \u0003 Tl. This is 0.3902\nwhen l \u0003 2.\nPerhaps most remarkably, the values of m and p corre-\nsponding to experimentally observable QAM are deter-\nmined by the Farey hierarchy of rational numbers [14].\nThis representation of rational numbers is a generic feature\nof mode locking phenomena normally observed in systems\nFIG. 2 (color online).

The labels correspond to those\nused in Fig. 1.\nPRL 96, 164101 (2006) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending28 APRIL 2006\n164101-3\nwith dissipation. In this hierarchy all rational numbers in\n\u00060; 1\u0007 are constructed as follows: Start from the pair \u000101 ; 11\u0002.\nAt the second level the fraction 12 \u0003 0\u000411\u00041 is introduced so\nthat the series consists of \u000101 ; 12 ; 11\u0002. On the next level the\nfractions 13 \u0003 0\u000411\u00042 and 23 \u0003 1\u000412\u00041 are added. This process is\ncontinued so that if r1 \u0003 m1p1 and r2 \u0003\nm2\np2\nare adjacent\nirreducible fractions at some level, the first rational to be\nadded between them at the next level is their Farey mediant\nr \u0003 m1\u0004m2p1\u0004p2 . At no level can a rational with a denominator\nsmaller than p1 \u0004 p2 be found between r1 and r2. At each\nlevel the interval \u00060; 1\u0007 is thus divided by the Farey frac-\ntions into Farey subintervals. As the experimental line\napproaches \u00010 in Fig. 3, it successively intersects tongues\nspecified by values of (p;m); these values determine the\nobserved QAM. The ratios m=p are increasingly close\napproximations to \u00010.\nTo determine the tongues (and hence QAMs) appearing\nin the experiment, we start from orbits with small p. In\nFig. 3(a) the \u00011; 0\u0002 and \u00011; 1\u0002 tongues are presented (their\nvertices, at K \u0003 0, are outside the boundaries of Fig. 2).\nThese correspond to the first numbers in the Farey hier-\narchy. The dotted line marking the experimental points\nintersects (within the boundaries of the figure) the \u00011; 0\u0002\ntongue. In the region of intersection the stable orbit \u00011; 0\u0002 is\nfound. The corresponding QAMs exhibit rapid accelera-\ntion, and at n \u0003 30 pulses they move beyond the experi-\nmental window shown in Fig. 1. For higher-order QAMs,\nhigher orders of the Farey hierarchy are required. At the\nsecond level the \u00012; 1\u0002 tongue, shown in Fig. 3(b), is\nintroduced, and \u00010 is in the interval \u000601 ; 12\u0007. The experimen-\ntal line intersects the \u00012; 1\u0002 tongue, so a \u00012; 1\u0002 orbit (and\nQAM) is found. Corresponding points are marked by (a) in\nFigs. 1 and 3(b). The third level [Fig. 3(c)] introduces the\n\u00013; 1\u0002 and \u00013; 2\u0002 tongues. The experimental line intersects\nboth these tongues, yet only the \u00013; 1\u0002 QAM is observed\n[intersection region marked by (b) in Figs. 1 and 3(c)]. This\nis because 23 is further than\n1\n3 from \u0001\n0\n, and so the inter-\nsection with the \u00013; 2\u0002 tongue takes place in a region where\nK > 2\u0004p\u00053=2. There are only narrow remnants of the\ntongue, and the corresponding stable island is too small\nfor a QAM to be observable. The relevant Farey subin-\nterval is now 13 to\n1\n2 . The construction can be continued in\nsimilar fashion. In Fig. 3(d) the \u00015; 2\u0002 and \u00015; 3\u0002 tongues are\nintroduced. Since both lines have a large overlap with the\n\u00015; 2\u0002 tongue [regions marked with (c)], the corresponding\nQAM appears on both sides of the resonance. Proceeding\nwould ideally produce all the Farey subintervals in which\n\u00010 belongs. Faint traces of QAMs that lie outside this\nrecursion may also be detected, e.g., the white curve (d)\nin Fig. 1 corresponds to a \u00017; 3\u0002 mode. Note how in the\nexperimental data it is disfavored in comparison with the\n\u00018; 3\u0002 mode [curve (e)], as 38 is closer than 37 to \u00010.\nThis construction demonstrates how the Farey tree clas-\nsifies the complex structure of overlapping tongues accord-\ning to those that are most important for the description of\nQAMs observed for a specific value of \u00010. Furthermore, as\nK ! 0, the value of mp for the QAMs seen in the experiment\nconverges to \u00010. As \u00010 is determined by the local value of\ngravity, we obtain systematically improving rational ap-\nproximants of g. The underlying classical mode locking\nmechanism thus renders quantum accelerator modes a\nrobust tool for efficient quantum state control, deep in\nthe quantum realm.\nWe acknowledge support from the Royal Society, the\nLindemann Trust, the US-Israel BSF, the Minerva Centre\nof Nonlinear Physics of Complex Systems, NASA, the\nClarendon Bursary, the UK EPSRC, the Israel Science\nFoundation, and the EU TMR \u2018\u2018Cold Quantum Gases\u2019\u2019\nNetwork.\n*Present address: Department of War Studies, King\u2019s\nCollege London, London WC2R 2LS, United Kingdom.\n\u2020Present address: Department of Physics, Durham\nUniversity, Durham DH1 3LE, United Kingdom.\n[1] T.
