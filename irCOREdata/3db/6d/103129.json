In Germany, any moves away from separate gen-\ndered spheres in terms of either wives\u2019 relative earnings or husbands\u2019\nrelative participation in housework increase the risk of divorce. In\nthe United States, however, the more stable couples are those that\nadapt by displaying greater gender equity. These results highlight\nthat policy shapes how gender gets done in the intimate sphere, and\nthat reinforcement of a gendered division of labor may be detri-\nmental to marital stability.\nA growing body of evidence indicates that the rules of economic exchange\ndo not predict who does the housework once wives\u2019 relative earnings\nexceed their husbands\u2019. Although the division of housework tends to be-\ncome more equitable as wives\u2019 relative household earnings increase from\nnone to about half, it then reverts to a more traditional division as wives\nbecome the primary breadwinner (Bittman et al. 2003; Brines 1994; Green-\n1 Earlier versions of these analyses were presented at the International Sociological\nAssociation RC28 semiannual meeting in Neuchatel, Switzerland, May 7\u20139, 2004, and\nthe annual meeting of the American Sociological Association in Atlanta, August 16\u2013\n19, 2003.

This latter phenomenon has been attributed to couples\u2019 \u201cdo-\ning\u201d gender in their marital relationship (Bittman et al. 2003; Brines 1994).\nBy doing gender, people actively manage social interactions in light of\nnormative expectations (Fenstermaker Berk 1985; West and Zimmerman\n1987). The division of housework in particular reflects the \u201cmaterial em-\nbodiment of wifely and husbandly roles, and derivatively, of womanly\nand manly conduct\u201d (West and Zimmerman 1987, p. 144). Consequently,\nhousework produces both a material and symbolic product of marriage\nso that what would seem the fairest division under the rules of exchange\ndoes not necessarily occur within the home (Fenstermaker Berk 1985; see\nalso Hochschild 1989).\nThe first contribution of this article is to turn attention to the \u201cSo what?\u201d\nIf the division of housework reflects couples\u2019 negotiation of intimate life,\nwhat is the effect of these negotiations on marital stability? To date re-\nsearch has focused on the effects of the division of paid labor on marital\nstability; little is known about effects resulting from the division of unpaid\nlabor. Two schools of thought theorize the impact of the household division\nof labor on marital stability, and these offer competing hypotheses. The\nfirst is that gender specialization benefits family solidarity because it in-\ncreases couples\u2019 mutual dependence (Becker 1981; Parsons 1942, 1953).\nUnder this specialization and trading model (Oppenheimer 1997),\nwomen\u2019s employment poses a threat to the benefits of specialization be-\ncause it reduces women\u2019s economic dependence upon men, in turn pre-\ndicting a greater risk of divorce (Becker 1985). By extension, although\nnever assessed, husbands\u2019 greater domestic participation also threatens\nthe mutual dependence created by specialization, and so should also in-\ncrease the risk of divorce.\nThe second school of thought evolves from social exchange and bar-\ngaining models (Blau 1960; England and Farkas 1986; McElroy and Hor-\nney 1981). Couples negotiate the division of paid and unpaid labor to a\nunique equitable distribution within the family based on relative wages,\npreferences, and so on. These models hold that alternatives to the marriage\nare important determinants of relative bargaining power that influence\npossible divisions (McElroy and Horney 1981). In these models, women\u2019s\nemployment and economic independence more generally increase their\nability to invoke a credible threat of divorce if a more favorable division\nof domestic labor cannot be negotiated. Under this dynamic, husbands\u2019\ngreater domestic participation should decrease the risk of divorce (Breen\nand Cooke 2005).\nTo explore which of these competing hypotheses reflects reality, we first\nassess whether husbands\u2019 share of unpaid, domestic tasks increases the\nrisk of divorce as would be predicted by the specialization and trading\nmodel, or decreases the risk of divorce as predicted by social exchange\nAmerican Journal of Sociology\n444\nand bargaining models. We then explore the effect of any compensatory\nactions that suggest doing gender in the domestic sphere as women\u2019s\nrelative earnings rise, which falls outside of either model\u2019s prediction.\nWith the arguments to date, however, we are left with another set of\ncompeting hypotheses. If doing gender in this way represents a process\nby which dual-earning couples neutralize gender deviance (Bittman et al.\n2003; Greenstein 2000), and doing so is beneficial to marital relations, it\nshould decrease the risk of divorce. If, instead, wives taking on a greater\nshare of domestic tasks as their relative earnings exceed their husbands\u2019\nreflects a display of relative gender power running counter to what is\nperceived as fair under notions of distributive justice, it should increase\nthe risk of divorce.\nDoing gender, however, is an active process reflecting the institutional\nshaping of gender relations. Structural and ideological incompatibilities\nbetween the home and workplace limit women\u2019s ability to achieve equity\nin either sphere (Ferree 1990; Hartmann 1981). The degree to which\ninstitutional factors reinforce more or less traditional divisions of labor\nvaries across industrialized societies (Lewis 1992). The second contribution\nof this article is to explore how household divisions of labor and any\nassociated risks of divorce vary in the sociopolitical context. To do so, I\nuse the U.S. Panel Study of Income Dynamics and the German\nSocioEconomic Panel to compare the risk of divorce among couples as\nthey marry and negotiate the household division of labor in the United\nStates, where there is less institutional support for the traditional male\nbreadwinner model, with West Germany, where there has been strong\ninstitutional support for the traditional gendered division of labor. Panel\ndata are used, as they are most suitable for assessing the dynamic process\nof couple negotiations of the division of labor (Kalleberg and Rosenfeld\n1990) as well as the risk of life transitions such as divorce (Allison 1984).\nTHE HOUSEHOLD DIVISION OF LABOR IN CONTEXT\nThe desirability of the gendered division of labor\u2014when husbands spe-\ncialize in economic production while wives specialize in domestic\n(re)production\u2014is judged differently depending upon whether one is the-\norizing about household versus individual outcomes. At the household\nlevel, the specialization and trading model (Oppenheimer 1997) holds that\nmutual dependence (Becker 1981) and family solidarity (Parsons 1953)\nare created when partners specialize, then trade the fruits of their spe-\ncialties. When women are instead economically independent, marriage is\nless advantageous to them, and divorce rates are predicted to rise (Becker\n1981, 1985).\n\u201cDoing\u201d Gender\n445\nEmpirical evidence of the direct relationship between women\u2019s em-\nployment and marital instability, however, is mixed (see Rogers 2004).\nWhile some studies report a positive relationship (Becker, Landes, and\nMichael 1977; Brines and Joyner 1999; Ruggles 1997; South 2001), others\nfind that the positive relationship stems from changes in the pool of avail-\nable partners (Aberg 2003; South and Lloyd 1995) or only when the mar-\nriage is an unhappy one (Schoen et al. 2002). Still other research finds no\nsignificant relationship (Bumpass, Martin, and Sweet 1991; Hoffman and\nDuncan 1995; Greenstein 1990, 1995). Consequently, it is not clear that\nwomen\u2019s participation in the employment sphere is directly harmful to\nfamily stability and raises questions about the desirability of specialization\n(see also Oppenheimer 1988, 1997).\nFrom an individual perspective, specialization is problematic because\nthe mutual dependence is not a marker for equality within the marriage\n(Goldscheider and Waite 1991). As argued within the social exchange or\nbargaining literature, dominant power is held by the person who is less\ndependent on the relationship in terms of having attractive alternatives\n(Blau 1960; Emerson 1962; Thibaut and Kelley 1959), with economic\nresources a primary source of power (Blood and Wolfe 1960; Weber 1958).\nEconomic resources are more transferable than an investment in a par-\nticular relationship and children, so a woman\u2019s specialization in the do-\nmestic sphere reduces her outside alternatives to a given marriage (En-\ngland and Farkas 1986). In addition, having children by a prior\nrelationship is not advantageous to women seeking a new partner, es-\npecially if she requires that the new partner contribute his own resources\nto support these children.\nConsequently, the gendered division of labor ex ante favors husbands\nby giving them direct access to economic resources and superior alter-\nnatives to the marriage (England 1993). This enables them to negotiate\nsolutions more favorable to themselves in terms of leisure time and their\nassistance with the amount or type of domestic tasks (Blau, Ferber, and\nWinkler 2002). There is also evidence that husbands expropriate more of\nthe family economic resources for their own behalf (Blau et al. 2002),\neven those transfers specifically intended for other family members (Lund-\nberg, Pollak, and Wales 1997). Further, a wife\u2019s economic dependency\nleaves her vulnerable to a husband\u2019s exploitation or abuse and, in the\ncase of his death or desertion, poverty.\nIt is not surprising, therefore, that as female wage rates rose after World\nWar II, women joined the labor force in increasing numbers. About two-\nthirds of women ages 15 to 64 across industrialized countries are in the\nlabor force, although this rate varies from a low of less than 50% in\nsouthern European countries to a high of over 75% in Scandinavian\ncountries (OECD 2000), with married women\u2019s participation rates even\nAmerican Journal of Sociology\n446\nmore varied (Jaumotte 2003). Under social exchange and bargaining mod-\nels, the rising female employment was expected to lead to a revolution in\nthe gendered division of domestic labor. In the late 1980s, however, Hochs-\nchild (1989) deemed the revolution \u201cstalled.\u201d Controlling for employment\nor earnings, time in domestic tasks changes as women and men move\ninto and out of different familial states, with women increasing their\nhousework hours when in unions while men decrease theirs (Gupta 1999a;\nSouth and Spitze 1994).\nTo explain the anomaly, Fenstermaker Berk (1985) argues that the home\nis a \u201cgender factory,\u201d producing and reproducing intimate identities of\nmasculinity and femininity. \u201cSimultaneously, members \u2018do\u2019 gender, as they\n\u2018do\u2019 housework and child care, and what [has] been called the division\nof labor . . . is the mechanism by which both the material and symbolic\nproducts of the household are realized\u201d (Fenstermaker Berk 1985, p. 201).\nThe home is just one arena in which we do gender, but it is the primary\nsite of our intimate identities and therefore an important one.\nThe concept of \u201cdoing\u201d gender reflects that we are not simply born into\na sex or gender identity or merely functioning in a gender role, but that\ngender is a \u201croutine, methodical, and recurring accomplishment\u201d (West\nand Zimmerman 1987, p. 126). Social interactions provide the context for\nreinforcing the proscribed essentialness of gender. These interactions do\nnot express natural differences between women and men, but produce\nthe differences (Goffman 1977). By doing gender, we reflect the social\nstructure as well as derive relative power consequences of gender category\nmembership (West and Zimmerman 1987). In this way, as individual\nmembers of society, we actively replicate gender hierarchies in social\ninteractions.\nHistorically, the division of labor within industrialized societies pro-\nduces and reproduces gender hierarchies (Ferree 1990; Hartmann 1981).\nEarly in industrialization, policies supporting family wages for men and\nmarriage bars for women, along with protective legislation limiting\nwomen\u2019s work activities, locations, and hours, all further reinforced men\u2019s\ndominance in paid labor (Goldin 1990; Lewis 1992). Despite the elimi-\nnation of such explicitly gendered labor force policies across many coun-\ntries, gender differences in employment persist, including both horizontal\nand vertical segregation and a gender wage gap even after controlling for\neducation and experience (Blau et al. 2002; Harkness and Waldfogel 1999).\nOne argument is that women\u2019s continued responsibility for the domestic\nsphere inhibits their ability to attain employment equality with men (Fer-\nree 1990; Hartmann 1981; Hobson 1990). So as an interlocking system,\nthe gendered nature of both paid and unpaid work blocks the ability to\nachieve gender equality in either domain (Ferree 1990, p. 874).\nAs evidence, contrary to the \u201clogic of the pocketbook\u201d (Hochschild\n\u201cDoing\u201d Gender\n447\n1989), as women\u2019s earnings exceed those of men, an even more traditional\ndivision of domestic tasks emerges (Bittman et al. 2003; Brines 1994;\nFenstermaker Berk 1985; Greenstein 2000; Hochschild 1989). Brines\n(1994) finds that as U.S. wives\u2019 relative earnings increase, they decrease\ntheir hours of domestic tasks in a linear fashion predicted under exchange\nmodels, but their husbands decrease their own as well. She interprets this\nas men\u2019s need for \u201cgender display,\u201d with manhood an achieved status put\nunder threat when wives take on the traditionally male economic role in\nthe household. Greenstein (2000) finds similar results when using absolute\nhours of housework, but when using proportional measures, finds that\nboth husbands and wives adjust their behavior to more normative di-\nvisions. He claims that proportional measures are more appropriate, as\nthey \u201care more likely to capture the distributive justice or equity aspects\nof the division of housework\u201d (Greenstein 2000, p. 325).\nBittman et al. (2003) also find that Australian and U.S. couples do\ngender in terms of compensating behavior in the division of domestic\ntasks as wives\u2019 earnings exceed their husbands\u2019, but in Australia, it is the\nwomen who compensate by increasing their domestic hours. The authors\noffer the explanation that Australian women\u2019s corrective response is larger\nthan that found for U.S. women because institutional differences make\nwomen\u2019s primary breadwinning more anomalous in Australia than in the\nUnited States. The \u201cfamily wage\u201d central to strong male breadwinner\nnation-states was part of Australian governmental wage setting\n(O\u2019Connor, Orloff, and Shaver 1999).\nConsequently, while \u201cdoing\u201d gender occurs in interactions at the indi-\nvidual level, its patois derives from the institutional setting, with correc-\ntive action more pronounced where more traditional gender roles have\nbeen reinforced by policy. This proposition that policy alters the ways in\nwhich couples negotiate the household division of labor bears elaboration\nand further testing.\nDoing Gender in Its Policy Context\nJane Lewis (1992) suggests classifying countries as ranging from \u201cstrong\u201d\nto \u201cweak\u201d male breadwinner states by the extent to which policy reinforces\nmen\u2019s preferential access to employment and women\u2019s responsibility for\nthe unpaid care work in the private sphere. Germany is the ideal-typical\nstrong male breadwinner state (Lewis 1992). At the end of World War II,\nWest Germany founded a new political system based on \u201cnatural law\u201d\n(Naturrecht), stemming from a \u201cpre-political\u201d patriarchal order ordained\nby God (Moeller 1993). Strengthening the patriarchal family as an insti-\ntution dominated West German federal policy under Konrad Adenauer\nduring the 1950s and 1960s, with social provisions favoring male bread-\nAmerican Journal of Sociology\n448\nwinners with nonworking wives (Gerhard 1992; Ostner 1992; Zimmerman\n1993). Income splitting for taxation purposes, particularly beneficial to\nhigh-income, single-earner families, was introduced in 1958. In 1961,\nmothers were deemed the only satisfactory educators of their children, so\nthat schools were subsequently set up to finish after two hours on one\nday, six the next, and were closed over the lunch hour (Ostner 1993; von\nOertzen 1999). A 1966 federal report highlighted gender disparities in\neducational attainment and concluded that women were failing to exploit\nfully their right of education\u2014to the detriment of the education of the\nnext generation (von Oertzen 1999). Until 1977, domestic responsibilities\ncontinued to be recognized as West German women\u2019s legal duty (Hantrais\n1994).\nWest German women\u2019s educational attainment and employment lagged\nduring this time. Fewer West German women than men graduated from\nthe highest secondary school tracks and went on to university, and there\nare clear gender differences in the type of occupational training selected\n(Geschka 1990). At the time of economic unification with East Germany\nin 1990, only 44% of West German married women were employed, and\nonly half of this percentage were employed full-time (Ostner 1993).\nIn contrast, U.S. policy since World War II has primarily reflected the\nliberal tradition and addressed women\u2019s ability to compete in the labor\nmarket.2 Employment, training, and education discrimination on the basis\nof gender became illegal under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\nDuring the 1970s, laws expanded enforcement of this legislation, pro-\nmoting equal educational opportunities and job training. U.S. women\u2019s\nsecondary completion rates have historically been higher than those of\ntheir male counterparts. Since 1982, more bachelor\u2019s degrees have been\nconferred on U.S. women than men, women earn more associate and\nmaster\u2019s degrees than men, and they are coming close to parity in first-\nprofessional and doctoral degrees (U.S. Department of Education 2000).\nThese policies also encourage U.S. women\u2019s labor force participation, with\ntwo-thirds of U.S. married women with children ages 6 to 17 employed,\nas are almost 60% of married women with children under the age of 6\n(U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 2004). Unlike West German policy, U.S.\npolicy remains silent regarding who is responsible for the private sphere\n(Leibfried and Ostner 1991). This is not to say that gender equality is a\ngiven with liberal market economies (see Hartmann 1981), just that a\ngendered division of domestic labor is not specifically reinforced by U.S.\npolicy.\n2 Feminist or reformer concerns for women as mothers also play a key role in U.S.\npolicy, particularly at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century. Orloff\n(1996) provides a review of the scholarship documenting this era.\n\u201cDoing\u201d Gender\n449\nFrom these divergent policy paths, the institutional framework defining\nwhere gender should be \u201cdone\u201d vis-a`-vis the division of labor varies across\nthe countries. Not surprisingly, on attitudinal surveys West Germans ex-\npress greater support for the traditional gendered division of labor than\ndo U.S. persons (Breen and Cooke 2005). Analyzed here is the extent to\nwhich these more traditional attitudes translate into more traditional\nhousehold divisions of labor within West German as compared with U.S.\ncouples, and whether different divisions of labor alter the risk of divorce\nfor couples in either country.\nTHE DIVISION OF LABOR AND MARITAL STABILITY\nThe specialization and trading model relates women\u2019s rising employment\nto rising risk of divorce but has not explicitly predicted effects of husbands\u2019\ngreater domestic contribution. If specialization creates an essential mutual\ndependence, it can be deduced within this framework that men\u2019s increas-\ning domestic contribution undermines specialization and so would also\nbe predicted to increase the risk of divorce.\nIn contrast, social exchange (Blau 1960), contract (England and Farkas\n1986), and game theoretic bargaining models (Manser and Brown 1980;\nMcElroy and Horney 1981) view the observed household division of labor\nas the result of couple negotiations that reflect each person\u2019s relative power\nand resources. Divorce is not the given outcome but forms the lower bound\nof an acceptable outcome, a person\u2019s threat point, or BATNA (best al-\nternative to a negotiated agreement). If women find themselves unable to\nnegotiate a favorable division of domestic tasks, economically independent\nwomen are able to then leave the marriage. As more women gain economic\nindependence, more are able to threaten divorce (Breen and Cooke 2005).\nThis suggests that the higher divorce rates since World War II are not\nreflecting just effects of women\u2019s rising employment; they reflect men\u2019s\nresistance to changing their domestic behavior in response to women\u2019s\nrising employment. Lennon and Rosenfeld (1994) find that women with\nmore alternatives to the marriage perceive unequal divisions of domestic\ntasks as unfair, whereas women with fewer alternatives report greater\nacceptance of the situation. Schoen et al. (2002) find that U.S. women\u2019s\nemployment only increases the risk of divorce when the marriage is an\nunhappy one. More than two decades ago, Huber and Spitze (1980) found\nthat while wives\u2019 thoughts of divorce increase with their own employment,\nthey decrease with husbands\u2019 increasing housework contribution. To date,\nhowever, analyses of the effect of wives\u2019 employment on divorce have\nnot controlled for possible countervailing effects of husbands\u2019 domestic\ncontribution. If the social exchange and bargaining predictions are correct,\nAmerican Journal of Sociology\n450\nhusbands\u2019 greater share of domestic tasks should decrease the risk of\ndivorce.\nIt should be noted that Lundberg and Pollak (1993, 1994) question\nwhether divorce is the true threat point in family bargaining. They argue\nthat even if couples cannot reach agreement, there are still benefits such\nas shared living economies and enjoyment of the children that make\ndivorce a less desirable alternative. They suggest that failing agreement,\ncouples first revert to a noncooperative strategy reflecting the traditional\nroles under the gendered division of labor. The absence of cooperation in\nmarriage, however, results in either a poorly maintained home or fewer\nchildren, since a woman will only produce what she can manage on her\nown (Lundberg and Pollak 1993). There is evidence of these dynamics\nacross countries. Couples in which the husband contributes less to house-\nwork or childcare have a lower risk of second children in Germany (Cooke\n2004), Hungary, Sweden (Ola\u00b4h 2003), and, depending on wives\u2019 employ-\nment status, the United States (Torr and Short 2004). Consequently, only\nthe effects of the division of housework on likelihood of divorce shall be\nanalyzed here.\nNeither the specialization and trading nor social exchange and bar-\ngaining models offer predictions for the effects of compensating behavior\non the risk of divorce. For this we link the hypothesized reasons for doing\ngender in the household division of labor to possible family effects. Bitt-\nman et al. (2003) and Greenstein (2000) argue that the compensating\nbehavior in the form of a woman\u2019s greater domestic share when she is\nalso the primary breadwinner neutralizes gender deviance in a marriage.\nIf minimizing this deviance is essential not only to intimate identities but\nto relationship stability, doing gender in this way should decrease the risk\nof divorce. If, instead, the rules of exchange and distributive justice dom-\ninate in successful couples, female breadwinners compensating by taking\non a greater share of domestic tasks might be performing a stop-gap\nmeasure within an inherently unfair situation. If so, the risk of divorce\nshould be higher in couples exhibiting the compensating division of do-\nmestic tasks than in couples where there is gender equity. By gender equity\nwe refer to when wives\u2019 relative contribution to earnings is the same as\nhusbands\u2019 relative contribution to housework, ranging from zero, where\nwives contribute nothing to earnings and husbands contribute nothing to\nhousework, to 100, indicating women are the breadwinners while hus-\nbands assume all domestic tasks.\nThe effects of the household divisions of paid and unpaid labor on\ncouples\u2019 risk of divorce are compared in the United States and the former\nWest Germany to see whether they vary as policy support for the male\nbreadwinner model has varied. For this to be a meaningful comparison,\nthe propensity to divorce in each country must be similar, so we observe\n\u201cDoing\u201d Gender\n451\ndifferences in effects, not differences in overall likelihood of divorce. Dur-\ning the 1980s, the divorce rate in West Germany was just 30% as compared\nwith the U.S. rate at nearly 50%, but the West German rate has been\nrising. More recent statistics suggest that the current incidence of divorce\nis quite similar in the two countries, at 49.1 divorces per 100 marriages\nin the United States (U.S. Census Bureau 2000) as compared with 46.0\ndivorces per 100 marriages in unified Germany (EUROSTAT 2000).3\nAs illustrated in figure 1, attitudes toward marriage and divorce are\nalso highly similar in the two countries. The figure displays the mean\nreports by country for three questions from the 1994 International Social\nSurvey Program that assess attitudes about marriage and divorce: (1)\nmarried people are generally happier than single people, (2) a bad marriage\nis better than being single, and (3) divorce is the best solution to a bad\nmarriage. In both countries, the samples tend not to agree that married\npeople are happier, strongly disagree that a bad marriage is preferable to\nbeing single, and moderately agree that divorce is the best solution to a\nbad marriage, with West Germans slightly more likely to agree than U.S.\nrespondents.\nDATA\nWives\u2019 relative earnings, work hours, husbands\u2019 share of domestic tasks,\nnumber of children, and the risk of divorce vary across the marital life\ncourse. The most suitable way to assess these dynamic relationships is\nwith event-history analysis (Allison 1984; Yamaguchi 1991), which re-\nquires longitudinal data. The German SocioEconomic Panel (GSOEP)\nand the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) are selected for the\nanalyses.\nThe GSOEP is a longitudinal study of private German households\nwhere all household members over the age of 16 are interviewed annually\nfor data on the preceding year. The first wave occurred in 1984 with a\nrepresentative sample of 12,290 people in 5,921 households in the former\nWest Germany. In June 1990, sampling extended into the former East\nGermany, but East Germans shall not be included in this analysis as the\nmale breadwinner model was not institutionally reinforced in that region.\n3 Part of the current divorce rate in unified Germany might be attributable to the\nhigher historical rate in the former East Germany. Yet following the economic uncer-\ntainty of unification, East Germans were less likely for a time either to marry or divorce\nthan were West Germans (Mu\u00a8nz and Ulrich 1995). The most recent statistics available\nsuggest that the number of divorces as compared with number of marriages is now\nhigher in the former West La\u00a8nder than in the former East (http:\/\/www.statistik-\nportal.de\/Statistik-Portal\/en\/en_jb01_jahrtab3.asp).\nAmerican Journal of Sociology\n452\nFig. 1.\u2014West German (left column) and U.S. (right column) attitudes toward divorce.\nBased on 1994 International Social Survey Program data, reflecting mean country scores\non the questions ranging from 1, strongly agree, to 5, strongly disagree.\nThe constitution adopted by East Germany in 1949 enforced women\u2019s\nright and obligation to work, supported by extensive policy provisions\nenabling women to combine work and having children (Moeller 1993;\nOstner 1993; Zimmerman 1993). After unification, economic constraints\ndramatically increased unemployment in East Germany and made East\nGermans less likely to make any family transition\u2014into or out of marriage\n(Mu\u00a8nz and Ulrich 1995; Witte and Wagner 1995). Too few East German\ncouples in the sample married (69) and divorced (21) during the obser-\nvation window to conduct separate East German analyses.\nThe PSID is a longitudinal study of U.S. individuals and the family\nunits in which they reside, beginning in 1968 with a representative sample\nof 4,800 families in which the head only is normally interviewed. Although\ntwo thousand Latino households were added to the panel in 1990, they\nwere subsequently dropped in 1995 and a new, much smaller immigrant\nsample added. Consequently, the only ethnic differentiation possible in\nthe analysis here is when respondents are black. Historically, the rate of\nmarital dissolution has been greater for black couples (Hoffman and Dun-\ncan 1995; Ruggles 1997).\nFrom each data set, we select couples marrying for the first time be-\ntween 1985 and 1995 for which there is at least one year of data following\nthe marriage. These couples are followed through 1997 in the United\n\u201cDoing\u201d Gender\n453\nStates and 2000 in Germany.4 The year 1985 is selected for the beginning\nof the observation window, as it is the second year of GSOEP data col-\nlection. The same year is selected for the PSID data in order to follow\ncouples in both countries during the same historical time period. Couples\nalready married as of 1985 are excluded from analysis, since their inclusion\nbiases results with marriages of longer duration and would not provide\nan accurate portrayal of family dynamics affecting the risk of divorce for\nall couples from the beginning of their marriage. For example, in Green-\nstein\u2019s (2000, p. 327) sample drawn from the National Survey of Families\nand Households, the average marriage duration was 17 years, whereas\nin 1990, the median U.S. first-marriage duration was approximately eight\nyears (National Center for Health Statistics 1995).\nIn both panels, new members marrying into the sample can be assigned\na weight of zero if they are not within the original sampling frame. For\nthis reason, unweighted data are used for the analysis, although a com-\nparison of weighted and unweighted sample descriptive statistics indicates\nthat the two are highly similar. As a result, the analytical samples appear\nrepresentative of German and U.S. couples marrying during the time\nperiod.\nThe West German sample includes 559 couples, yielding an analytic\nsample of 4,483 couple-years, reduced to 3,524 due to listwise deletion of\nmissing data primarily because information on a couple was not available\nin all years. Subsequent analysis using indicator variables for when data\nare missing indicates robustness of key effects. While 1,122 Caucasian\nand 368 black U.S. persons in the panel married during the observation\nwindow, many did not continue reporting in subsequent years, so the\nanalytical sample is compsed of 506 couples (388 Caucasian and 118\nblack), or 4,204 couple-years. When indicator variables are included for\nthe missing data, key U.S. effects remain robust, although the significance\nlevels of some control variables change. Further, Lillard and Panis (1994)\nreport that biases from sample attrition in the PSID when analyzing\nmarital dissolution are generally mild. Also, demographics and the divi-\nsion of labor derived from the PSID sample used here have been compared\nwith cross sections of other more recently fielded surveys (National Survey\nof Families and Households and the International Social Survey Program)\nand appear similarly representative.\nIn the data set, each year of a couple\u2019s marriage is a distinct observation,\nbeginning with the first year of marriage and concluding with either\ndivorce or separation (which are not distinguished in this analysis given\n4 The PSID changed in 1997 to be conducted biannually, and the core sample was\nreduced by almost 30%. This created substantial missing data in the 1999 and inbe-\ntween waves, so I decided to end the U.S. observation window in 1997.\nAmerican Journal of Sociology\n454\nthe variation in required waiting periods between separation and divorce),\nor the final observation year in the panel. Constructing couple-years in\nthis way automatically incorporates the time-varying aspects of the in-\ndependent variables, but also violates the assumption that error terms\nnot be correlated. Consequently, robust standard errors clustering on a\nunique couple identification number are used.\nVariables\nTable 1 contains the descriptive statistics for the variables used in the\nanalyses. These statistics are based on the couple-year files constructed\nfor the event-history analyses, so the values of the time-varying variables\nrepresent averages over the observed years of marriage, not a snapshot\nof couples in any given year of marriage.\nDependent variable.\u2014The dependent variable is a binary variable in-\ndicating whether a couple reports a divorce or separation in a given year.\nOnce a divorce occurs, the couple is removed from analysis as they are\nno longer at risk of divorce. During the time period, 201 West German\ncouples reported divorcing, and 223 U.S. couples (153 white and 90 black)\nreported divorcing. These aggregate figures suggest the divorce rate in\nGermany is higher than in the United States, when as noted earlier it is\nroughly similar in the two countries. The U.S. couples, however, are being\nfollowed for three years less than their German counterparts. As the event-\nhistory models control for the effect of time on the risk of divorce, it will\nbe possible to see whether the shorter U.S. observation window is the\nreason the observed U.S. sample divorce rates appear lower.\nIndependent variables: Women\u2019s employment.\u2014In both panels, partic-\nipants are interviewed in a given year to ascertain information about their\nlives over the past 12 months. To ensure that causes of divorce are dif-\nferentiated from effects, values of the time-varying independent variables\nare lagged by one year. For example, if a woman is in the process of\nestablishing her own household, her share of household earnings would\nrise, leading to the erroneous conclusion that her greater earnings caused\nthe transition rather than resulted from it. Similarly, total household in-\ncome would decrease as dual-earner couples become single heads of house-\nhold. In a troubled marriage, both partners may also reduce their time\nspent in household tasks as commitment to the marital home declines.5\n5 Comparing models using lagged versus unlagged independent variables, these sorts\nof differences are borne out (results available from the author). The substantive effect\nof U.S. wives\u2019 relative earnings is larger when using unlagged variables, the effect of\nU.S. husbands\u2019 share of housework is smaller and becomes statistically insignificant,\nand the prophylactic effect of total household income is much larger in both countries.\n\u201cDoing\u201d Gender\n455\nTABLE 1\nMeans and Standard Deviations for West German and U.S. Couple\nIndependent and Control Variables Used in Event-History Models of\nDivorce\nWest Germany United States\nWife\u2019s share of labor earnings (0\u2013100) . . . . . . . . . . . 18.24 32.18\n(25.71) (24.12)\nHusband\u2019s share of housework (0\u2013100) . . . . . . . . . . 28.47 33.05\n(18.82) (24.58)\nHusband\u2019s share of housework, squared . . . . . . . . . 1,165 1,697\n(1,340) (2,349)\nWife\u2019s weekly work hours . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13.63 28.15\n(18.15) (15.74)\nWife\u2019s weekly hours of housework . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 28.80 17.40\n(15.05) (14.78)\nTotal household income (000) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 74.96 48.85\n(40.66) (44.84)\nLength of marriage . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5.39 4.57\n(3.43) (2.91)\nHusband\u2019s weekly work hours . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 39.74 41.59\n(14.47) (13.35)\nWife\u2019s age . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 30.25 30.23\n(5.13) (5.98)\nNumber of children . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.65 1.00\n(.94) (1.01)\nWife out of labor force (1 p yes) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .58 .09\nWife with university (1 p yes) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .10 .25\nHusband with university (1 p yes) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .19 .27\nOwn home (1 p yes) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .35 .53\nWife earns 1 50%#husband does \u2264 50%\nhousework (1 p yes) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .07 .08\nEquitable division (1 p yes) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .04 .14\nHusband black (1 p yes) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Total household income is in the local currency.\nMost analyses of women\u2019s employment on the likelihood of divorce\nassume that effects are linear by using a single continuous measure of\nwomen\u2019s hours of employment or wages. It is possible, however, that\nbeing a housewife is a fundamentally different state than being a part-\nor full-time working wife, particularly when comparing two countries\nwith varying support for the traditional division of paid labor. The tra-\nditional family might also, in turn, carry different risks of divorce. To\nassess these effects, a binary variable is included for when the wife is out\nAmerican Journal of Sociology\n456\nof the labor force, against a referent of wives who are employed.6 If\nspecialization is optimal for marital stability, these traditional couples\nshould have a lower risk of divorce than dual-earner couples. Further, as\nthe male breadwinner model has been reinforced more in Germany than\nin the United States, there should be more of these couples in Germany.\nAs displayed in table 1, over half of West German wives are out of the\nlabor force at some time during the observed years of marriage, as com-\npared with less than 10% of U.S. wives.\nTo keep the metrics for the division of paid and unpaid labor com-\nmensurate, a wife\u2019s contribution to the family labor earnings is measured\nas a percentage (0\u2013100) of the combined labor earnings of the wife and\nhusband. This measure is perfectly correlated with the relative depen-\ndency measure developed by Sorensen and McLanahan (1987) used in\nother analyses predicting the division of housework (Brines 1994; Green-\nstein 2000). As shown in table 1, across all couples, the average household\nearnings contribution of U.S. wives is almost twice that of West German\nwives: 32% versus 18%, respectively.\nWives\u2019 hours of paid work are included to control for the time demands\nemployment places on them that are theorized to alter the division of\nhousework separately from the effects of their relative earnings (Blood\nand Wolfe 1960; South and Spitze 1994). Other things being equal, the\nmore hours worked in the market, the fewer available for housework.\nTime constraints have proven important in predicting second births\namong German couples, an effect in addition to women\u2019s earnings\u2019 effects\n(Cooke 2004).7\nDivision of housework.\u2014The German data have variables for each\npartner\u2019s reported weekly domestic hours, including housework, running\nerrands, yard work and repairs, and child care, both during the week\nand the average hours on Saturday and on Sunday. The measure of house-\nwork used here is calculated as the time spent in all tasks with the ex-\nception of child care throughout the week. Child care is excluded as there\nis no similar measure within the PSID, but Cooke (2004) finds that German\nfathers\u2019 relative contribution to child care proves insignificant in altering\nthe risk of divorce.\nThe PSID measure of housework is more limited in two ways. First,\nin contrast to the GSOEP, the PSID normally relies on a single primary\n6 Doing so proves important to ascertaining true effects, for when not differentiating\nfor when women are out of the labor force, the effect of women\u2019s relative earnings\nappears much smaller because it is camouflaging the higher risk of divorce among\nU.S. couples where the wife is out of the labor force.\n7 The models were run with and without women\u2019s work hours with no substantive or\nsignificant changes in other effects or the fit of the model, but were left in for the\ntheoretical reasons stated above.\n\u201cDoing\u201d Gender\n457\nadult\u2014usually the male adult head if there is one\u2014to provide information\nfor all family members. Most evidence indicates that respondents over-\nestimate their own housework time and underestimate the time contri-\nbution of others (Shelton and John 1996), with Press and Townsley (1998)\nfinding that husbands\u2019 reports are less accurate than wives\u2019. The extent\nof the possible U.S. husband-only reporting bias was analyzed by com-\nparing a cross section of the longitudinal sample with a sample from one\nof the few PSID dual-respondent surveys (1985; results available from\nthe author). That analysis indicates that while U.S. husbands do tend to\nunderestimate their wives\u2019 housework hours, the relative division of\nhousework is fairly represented in the data once controlling for husbands\u2019\nreports of wives\u2019 estimated weekly housework hours, so there are no\nsignificant biases introduced in the model used here.\nThe second limitation of the PSID is that it contains a single question\nasking the respondent to estimate how many hours are spent in \u201chouse-\nwork, excluding child care\u201d each week. These data were used in the\nanalyses by both Brines (1994) and Gupta (1999b) to reveal that at the\nextreme of a husband\u2019s dependence on his wife, there is evidence of gender\ndisplay. A single measure does not provide the detail of the German data,\nnor is it as rich as the series of questions asked of U.S. respondents on\nthe National Survey of Families and Households and analyzed by Green-\nstein (2000).8 None of these are as precise as the time diary data used by\nBittman et al. (2003) in their analysis of Australian couples. But despite\nthe wide range in the crudeness of the housework measure, results are\nremarkably consistent in terms of the extent of equity or compensatory\nbehavior made evident with them. Consequently, concern for the quality\nof the housework measure appears more philosophical than applicable to\nthe analysis.\nHusbands\u2019 relative domestic participation is measured by dividing their\nweekly hours in housework by the combined household hours of the wife\nand husband, yielding their percentage share of domestic tasks ranging\nfrom 0 to 100. Also included is the square of this term to test for nonlin-\nearity. If the squared term is positive and significant, this indicates that\nhusbands\u2019 greater relative housework contribution at some point begins\nto increase the risk of divorce. A relative rather than absolute housework\nmeasure is used because of Greenstein\u2019s (2000) evidence that compensating\nbehavior is more evident when controlling for the relative rather than the\nabsolute housework contribution of each. As also noted by Greenstein\n8 Although the National Survey of Families and Households collects more detailed\ninformation on household tasks for each family member, it has only conducted three\nwaves several years apart (1987\u201388, 1992\u201394, and 2001\u20132002), which makes it less\nsuitable than the PSID for conducting event-history analyses of divorce.\nAmerican Journal of Sociology\n458\n(2000), perceptions of fairness and distributive justice are related to the\nrelative, not total amount.\nWomen\u2019s reported housework hours are included to control for the\nhusband-only reporting bias in the PSID, as well as to control for when\nmen\u2019s share of housework is greater because women\u2019s own housework\nhours decline when they are employed (Bianchi et al. 2000; Goldscheider\nand Waite 1991; Shelton and John 1996). Including this measure does not\ncreate a problem of multicollinearity with women\u2019s hours of employment,\nhowever, because while employed women\u2019s housework hours adjust to\nreflect competing time demands, the sharpest drop in housework hours\nsince the 1960s has been among women who are out of the labor force\n(Gershuny 2000).9\nAs evident in table 1, German wives spend more hours in housework\non average than their U.S. counterparts (29 and 17 hours, respectively),\nalthough this could be due to the higher proportion of housewives in the\nGerman sample. Overall, the gendered division of housework appears\nroughly similar in the two countries, with husbands in each country per-\nforming about one-third of the housework as has been found in other\ncross-national studies (Gershuny 2000). Husbands\u2019 share of housework\nwhen wives are employed is less similar in the two countries, with U.S.\nhusbands claiming to perform 44% as compared with German husbands\nperforming 38%.10\nThe above measures enable us to assess the economic exchange rela-\ntionship between the household division of labor and risk of divorce\npredicted by bargaining models, but not whether compensatory behavior\nin the division of domestic tasks reduces the risk of divorce when the\nwife\u2019s earnings exceed her husband\u2019s. To assess this, an interaction in-\ndicator variable is created for when wives\u2019 relative earnings exceed 50%\nand husbands\u2019 share of housework does not exceed 50%. In Germany,\nonly 13% of wives earn more than their husbands, compared with 24%\nof U.S. wives. As can be seen in table 1, roughly half of these German\nfemale-breadwinning couples but just one-third of U.S. female-bread-\nwinning couples compensate for wives\u2019 higher earnings by doing gender\nin this way (7% of the German and 8% of the U.S. samples). This is\nconsistent with Bittman et al.\u2019s (2003) Australian evidence that compen-\nsating behavior in the domestic sphere is more common in strong male\nbreadwinner states.\n9 Including women\u2019s housework hours significantly improves the fit of the model, but\ndoes not substantively or significantly alter effects of other variables.\n10 Disability or poor health can also alter the household division of labor, but only one\nor two of these younger first-married couples report that one of the partners is in ill\nhealth or is disabled in any given year.\n\u201cDoing\u201d Gender\n459\nControl variables.\u2014Controls for a wife\u2019s age, number of children, total\nfamily income, home ownership, and college or university attainment are\nincluded in the models. According to models of assortative mating, people\nwho are older at marriage are less likely to divorce because of a decrease\nin possible future marital partners (Becker et al. 1977). But culturally\ndefined bargaining disadvantages specific to women at older ages also\nexist. In many industrialized societies, youth and beauty prove valued\ncharacteristics of women and less important for the marriage prospects\nof men (England and Farkas 1986; Parsons 1942). Youth by definition\ndisappears with age, so women lose their bargaining advantage over time\nregardless of any other factors. A variable is included here to control for\nwomen\u2019s age. In both country samples, wives are, on average, 30 years\nold.\nPersons with higher-valued characteristics such as university education\nor wealth gain more from marriage and are therefore less likely to divorce\nnet of other factors (Becker et al. 1977). The log of total household income\nis included to control for wealth of the family. Men\u2019s education level is\npositively associated with their domestic participation (South and Spitze\n1994), whereas other studies find no association (Kamo 1991; McAllister\n1990), or that the effect disappears once gender ideology is included (Kamo\n1994). Women\u2019s greater educational attainment is associated with less time\nin domestic tasks (Blair and Lichter 1991; South and Spitze 1994), and\nis normally interpreted as an education effect on ideology. There is some\nU.S. evidence that the historical effect of wife\u2019s greater educational at-\ntainment lowering the risk of divorce is attenuating in younger cohorts\n(South 2001). A binary variable is created for women or men with college\nor university education, against a referent of less than college.\nIn neoclassical economic models of marriage, children and home own-\nership represent accrued \u201cmarital goods,\u201d so they predict a lower risk of\ndivorce (Becker 1981). One might also argue that more stable couples are\nmore willing to purchase a home together or have additional children,\nsuggesting these might reflect a selection bias. Number of children in the\nfamily in a given year is entered into the models as a continuous variable.\nHome ownership is measured with a binary variable indicating when a\ncouple owns their home, against a referent of renting.\nThe risk of divorce can change as a function of time, irrespective of\nthe independent variables, so a variable is included for years since mar-\nriage. This also enables assessment of whether the observed country dif-\nferences in the incidence of divorce relative to sample size reported earlier\nare a function of time. A piecewise constant model including a series of\nyear binary variables representing two to three, three to four, four to five,\nand five or more years from year of marriage was also tried, but any\nAmerican Journal of Sociology\n460\nsignificant time effects in the respective countries proved to be essentially\nlinear during the observed years of marriage.\nIn the U.S. model, a binary variable is also included indicating when\nthe husband is black, against a referent of when the husband is Caucasian.\nRacial marital homogamy is high: 95% of black women are married to\nblack men and 99% of Caucasian women are married to Caucasian men.\nFINDINGS: THE DIVISION OF LABOR AND RISK OF DIVORCE\nThe changes in the log odds that a West German or U.S. couple will\ndivorce are presented in table 2. Discussion focuses on effects of the\nvariables measuring the household division of labor. Two models are\npresented: one modeling the effects of the household division of labor\nusing continuous measures, and the second adding the indicator term for\nwhen husbands perform half or less of domestic tasks when wives earn\nmore than half of the couple\u2019s labor income.\nEffects of the Household Division of Labor\nResults for model 1 indicate specialization is optimal for marital stability\nin West Germany, but not in the United States. While male breadwinner\ncouples in both countries are more likely to divorce, the effect only reaches\nstatistical significance in the United States. Women\u2019s rising relative earn-\nings also predict a rising risk of divorce, with the effect twice the mag-\nnitude in the United States as in Germany. Each percentage point increase\nin a wife\u2019s earnings as a percentage of her and her husband\u2019s total labor\nearnings increases the log odds of divorce by 1% in West Germany and\n2% in the United States. Together these results suggest that the male\nbreadwinner couples reinforced by policy are the most stable in West\nGermany, whereas dual-earner couples are the most stable in the United\nStates provided a woman\u2019s earnings do not exceed her husband\u2019s. In the\nUnited States, being a male breadwinner couple increases the log odds\nof divorce by 0.83, comparable to the increase in risk when a wife is\nearning more than 41% of the family\u2019s labor income ( wife\u2019s41# 0.02\nearnings effect). So reliance on a primary breadwinner of either gender\namong U.S. couples proves more precarious than when there are two\nmore equal earners in the family.\nThese relative employment effects, however, do not take into account\npossible countervailing effects of the division of housework, for which\nthere are also marked country differences.

But the U.S.\nquadratic term is also significant, so once U.S. husbands\u2019 housework and\nwives\u2019 earnings contributions exceed about 30%, the risk of divorce again\nbegins to increase. Yet the net effect of husbands\u2019 housework contributions\nequaling wives\u2019 relative earnings still predicts lower log odds of divorce\nuntil both exceed 83%, which is an extremely nontraditional division of\npaid and unpaid labor.\nThese effects are depicted in figure 2, which plots changes in the log\nodds of divorce for percentage point changes in wives\u2019 relative earnings\nmatched by identical changes in husbands\u2019 share of housework (i.e., when\nwives contribute 10% of earnings, husbands\u2019 share of housework is also\n10%; when wives contribute half to earnings, husbands are doing 50%\nof the housework, etc.), controlling for other significant effects related to\nthe division of labor. In other words, it plots changes in the predicted risk\nof divorce when couples negotiate a division of paid and unpaid labor\nreflecting distributive justice. At the origin, indicating male breadwinner\ncouples, the single black diamond is the U.S. coefficient, which is slightly\nabove the gray circle indicating the German coefficient for risk of divorce.\nOnly here, comparing male breadwinner couples, is the relative risk of\ndivorce lower in West Germany than in the United States. All other more\negalitarian divisions of paid and unpaid labor increase the risk of divorce\nin West Germany whereas they reduce the risk of divorce in the United\nStates.\nThe second model in table 2 displays effects of compensatory domestic\nbehavior attributed to couples doing gender to neutralize gender deviance\nwhen wives become the primary breadwinner (Bittman et al. 2003; Brines\n1994). For the German couples, when wives perform a greater share of\nhousework as their relative earnings exceed 50%, the negative effects\nassociated with her greater relative earnings remain unaltered. For U.S.\ncouples, this compensatory behavior at the extreme nontraditional divi-\nsion of paid labor predicts a much lower risk of divorce. This suggests\nthat there are positive effects for gender equity in the U.S. household\ndivision of labor until parity is reached, but neutralizing gender deviance\nhas a prophylactic effect among those few women who are primary bread-\nwinners. Yet even under this compensating scenario, the remaining sig-\nnificance of the effect for husbands\u2019 housework share indicates that these\nnontraditional couples are most stable when husbands perform some share\nof the housework.11\n11 From coefficients in table 2, model 2: U.S. female breadwinner, husband contributes\nhalf to domestic tasks p [(100#0.02 wife\u2019s earnings) \u0002 (\u00010.04#50 husband\u2019s share\nof domestic)\u0002 (\u00010.03#13.50 employed wife\u2019s mean housework hours)\u0002\u00012.25 wives\u2019\n\u201cDoing\u201d Gender\n463\nFig. 2.\u2014Effect of earnings and housework exchange on U.S. and West German couples\u2019\nlog odds of divorce.

Any other divisions of paid\nand unpaid labor, even compensatory ones wherein a female breadwinner\nwould retain responsibility for domestic tasks, increases the risk of divorce.\nIn contrast, the rules of distributive justice appear to dominate among\nthese first-married U.S. couples until relative earnings approach a non-\ntraditional extreme. When wives\u2019 relative earnings exceed their hus-\nbands\u2019, couples can reduce the risk of divorce if wives continue to perform\na share of the housework. Further, when controlling for other significant\neffects related to the division of labor, U.S. female breadwinner families\nwhere the woman does half the housework have a lower risk of divorce\nthan German male breadwinner couples.12\ncompensatory domestic share effect in that the husband does no more than half] p\n\u00012.66.

These institutional\ndifferences, however, can manifest indirectly as well, reflecting other gen-\nder differences in relative bargaining power. As noted earlier, if wives\nhave not accrued work experience because they have been reliant on a\nmale breadwinner, having children increases their dependence and in-\nability to leave the marriage. In West Germany, where the majority of\nhouseholds are male breadwinner households, the presence of children\nsignificantly reduces the risk of divorce. The effect is linear, so each ad-\nditional German child further reduces the risk of divorce. In contrast, in\nthe United States, where the vast majority of couples have two earners\nso that the vast majority of wives have some accrued work experience,\nthe number of children does not alter the risk of divorce, a result also\nfound by others (South 2001; Waite and Lillard 1991).\nAnother difference in effects that might stem from the difference in the\ndegree to which policy encourages couples\u2019 economic interdependence\nversus wives\u2019 dependence is that of home ownership. In the United States,\nthe interest paid on home mortgages or loans secured with one\u2019s home is\ntax deductible. This provides U.S. married women with an incentive to\njoin the labor force, enabling the family to afford a larger home in a better\nneighborhood, which enhances a husband\u2019s status as well. There are some\ndeductions related to home ownership in Germany, but they are capped\nto a very modest level. As evident in table 2, home ownership reduces\nthe log odds of divorce in both countries. The effect, however, is more\nthan five times as great in the United States as in Germany (\u00011.23 vs.\n\u00010.23, respectively) and is only statistically significant in the United States\nfor these young couples. While other differences, such as the desirability\nof the rental sectors in the two countries, might account for part of this\ndifference, it is also possible that the economic interdependence within\ncouples created by the U.S. home mortgage tax provisions is a significant\nfactor. Future research might explore the effect of policies promoting\ngreater couple economic interdependence, as an antidote to the negative\neffects found here of policy reinforcement of the traditional male bread-\nwinner model and women\u2019s economic dependence.\nhousework hours) \u0002 \u00012.25 interaction effect that the husband does no more than half\nof domestic tasks] p \u00012.66).

Consequently, gender relations vary across insti-\ntutional contexts, with the hierarchy evident in and replicated by the\ngendered division of labor in society (Hartmann 1981; Lewis 1992). Only\nrecently, however, have policy influences and resultant divisions been\ncompared across societies (Baxter 1997; Bittman et al. 2003; Davis and\nGreenstein 2004; Fuwa 2004), and none of these analyses compared effects\nof varying household divisions of paid and unpaid labor on marital sta-\nbility. The specialization and trading model claims the traditional gen-\ndered division of labor reinforced in some sociopolitical contexts is optimal\nfor marital stability. Social exchange and bargaining models contend that\nwomen\u2019s rising economic equality with men alters the credibility of threat\npoints such as divorce through which more equitable distributions of\nhousehold labor can be negotiated. Under these models, equitable divi-\nsions of household paid and unpaid labor reflect distributive justice that\nshould enhance marital stability.\nHere, the household division of labor and its effects on marital stability\nof couples first married between 1985 and 1995 are compared in the United\nStates and the former West Germany. U.S. liberal policy encourages female\nlabor force participation while remaining silent on the private sphere,\nwhereas West Germany implemented policies after World War II rein-\nforcing women\u2019s legal responsibility for the home and economic depen-\ndence on a male breadwinner. With this historical reinforcement of the\ngendered division of labor, more West German couples report the wife is\nout of the labor force as compared with U.S. couples, where dual-earner\ncouples are the norm. When a West German wife is employed, she per-\nforms more domestic tasks, displaying more compensating domestic be-\nhavior for her nontraditional economic role than do U.S. wives. This is\nsimilar to evidence for couples in Australia, another strong male bread-\nwinner country relative to the United States (Bittman et al. 2003), and\nthe variation in individual effects across countries found by Fuwa (2004).\nTogether these findings highlight that it is not sufficient to look at indi-\nvidual resources in making predictions regarding the household division\nof labor; we must situate effects within the institutional setting, partic-\nularly the extent to which policy reinforces the gendered division of labor.\nThis determines the extent to which a gendered division of labor is done\nwithin the intimate sphere of the home.\nAs a counterargument, one might assert that other cultural differences\nexplain both the traditional policies and effects found for West Germany\nas compared with the United States. Yet the former East Germany shares\nAmerican Journal of Sociology\n466\na common cultural past with West Germany while the people were so-\ncialized for two generations under divergent policies affecting the division\nof labor. After World War II, East Germany adopted a Stalinist consti-\ntution that enforced women\u2019s obligation to work (Moeller 1993). To sup-\nport maternal employment, East Germany passed the 1950 Mother and\nChild Care and Women\u2019s Rights Acts, establishing a network of public\nchild care centers, kindergartens, and facilities for free school meals, and\nmaternity leave and days off to tend sick children (Ostner 1993; Zim-\nmerman 1993). The state also mandated developing women\u2019s skill cre-\ndentials through education and vocational training, and a larger propor-\ntion of East German women attended professional colleges and university\nthan in West Germany (Budde 1999). Recent evidence indicates that even\nafter economic reunification, the division of housework is significantly\nmore egalitarian in the former East than in West Germany (Cooke 2004),\nand is similar to the division reported here for U.S. couples. These dif-\nferences within Germany suggest it is not just culture reflected in the\ndivergent household divisions of labor in West Germany as compared\nwith the United States, but also state policy.\nThe institutional context shapes more than the household division of\nlabor; it also varies the effects of different divisions of paid and unpaid\nlabor on marital stability. Gender specialization proves optimal for marital\nstability in the country with institutional support for this model: West\nGerman male breadwinner couples are the most stable in that country,\nand any movement away from this in terms of wives\u2019 relative earnings\nor husbands\u2019 relative housework increases the risk of divorce. In contrast,\nequitable distributions of the household division of labor predicted under\nsocial exchange models appear optimal in the United States where policy\nremains silent on the private sphere and market effects meander their\nlaissez-faire course. At the extremes, however, both U.S. male and female\nbreadwinner couples are at greater risk of divorce. Yet female breadwin-\nner couples neutralizing gender deviance by having wives perform an\nequal share of domestic tasks are more stable than traditional male bread-\nwinner couples in either country.\nThese results suggest important extensions of our understanding of\ngender relations. First, the competing theories of effects of the household\ndivision of labor both hold true; which holds true depends upon the degree\nto which theorized dynamics are supported by institutional factors such\nas policies. This suggests that the slow evolution in the division of domestic\ntasks observed over the past half century may not result from persistent\ngender differences, but from continuing institutional reinforcement of the\ngendered division of labor (see also Breen and Cooke 2005). Change is\nnot revolutionary as initially predicted by Hochschild (1989); policies af-\nfect the progress of the evolution toward greater gender equity.\n\u201cDoing\u201d Gender\n467\nSecond, where the evolution is not thwarted by policies reinforcing\ntraditional gender hierarchies, men\u2019s greater participation in domestic\ntasks results in more stable marriages regardless of women\u2019s employment.\nThis finding raises questions regarding the wisdom of calls from conser-\nvative quarters to reinforce the traditional male breadwinner family to\nturn the tide of increasing family instability. Further, a gendered division\nof labor leaves women and their children economically vulnerable under\nmacroeconomic conditions that are more volatile than those of the 1960s.\nFor example, unemployment in West Germany was just 0.5% in 1965,\nrising during the 1980s and 1990s to 7% or 8% (OECD 1978, 2000). Most\nvulnerable during periods of high unemployment are persons with low\nskills and little experience, such as traditional housewives. Single female\nheads of household are more likely to be poor and reliant on state transfers\n(Daly and Rake 2003). Consequently, reinforcement of the male bread-\nwinner model appears of little benefit to women, children, or the state.\nOne might lament that U.S. female breadwinners must carry a one-\nand-one-half burden of paid and unpaid labor to ensure marital stability.\nWomen employed full-time, however, reduce their domestic hours, so such\nwomen\u2019s greater domestic share is based upon fewer total housework\nhours to be divided between the wife and husband. In addition, we cannot\ntell with these data the extent to which performing the remaining house-\nhold tasks represents an expression of love and caring rather than a burden\n(Ferree 1990). Future research needs to decipher, however, what U.S.\nhusbands that contribute little to either paid or unpaid labor do contribute\nto marriage to make them more successful than traditional ones.\nMore generally, the results shed no light on the process by which the\nhousehold division of labor might lead to marital instability. Does the\nhousehold division of labor alter marital quality, or do different divisions\nonly alter the risk of divorce within unhappy marriages as found by\nSchoen and his colleagues (2002)? There is also a tacit assumption within\nboth models that women initiate divorce, either because they no longer\neconomically require men (specialization and trading model), or because\nmen fail to take on more equitable divisions of domestic tasks (social\nexchange model). Given that different household divisions of labor appear\noptimal in different countries, our understanding of gender relations\nwould deepen with exploration into which partner under what circum-\nstances terminates the relationship under different policy configurations.\nWe remain somewhat cautious in our conclusions, however, because\neven among the more recent group of first-married couples analyzed here,\nfemale primary breadwinning couples are still outliers. Wives earned more\nthan 75% of the income in only 13% of U.S. and 7% of West German\ncouples in the sample. Still, the results highlight the idea that distributive\njustice prevails where gender hierarchies are not reinforced. Policy is\nAmerican Journal of Sociology\n468\ninstrumental in setting gender hierarchies, with the evidence here indi-\ncating that policy encouraging gender equity encourages family economic\nflexibility and marital stability. In other words, gender equity represents\nmore than a feminist ideal; it proves essential for sustaining healthy post-\nindustrial societies. Neither the United States nor Germany, however, has\npolicy provisions actively supporting maternal employment and encour-\naging men\u2019s participation in the domestic sphere, particularly in child\ncare, such as those found in Scandinavian countries (Gauthier 2005; Gor-\nnick and Meyers 2003). Future comparative research needs to look at the\nhousehold divisions of labor and effects of these on family outcomes across\na wider array of state, market, and gender relations.\nREFERENCES\nAberg, Yvonne. 2003. \u201cSocial Interactions: Studies of Contextual Effects and\nEndogenous Processes.\u201d PhD dissertation.
