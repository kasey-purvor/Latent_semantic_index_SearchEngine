The present study aimed to identify dietary\npatterns in school-aged children from the survey and investigate associations with socio-economic factors, obesity and physical activity. Habitual\ndiet was assessed using the Scottish Collaborative Group FFQ. Height and weight were measured by trained fieldworkers. A total of 1233 FFQ were\navailable for analysis. Dietary patterns were identified by age (5\u201311 and 12\u201317 years) and sex using principal components analysis. Associations\nbetween factor scores and socio-economic status, education level of the main food provider, physical activity levels and BMI category (based on\nUK 1990 charts) were examined. Three dietary patterns were identified in each age and sex group. \u2018Healthier\u2019 patterns loading highly for fruit and\nvegetables were significantly associated with higher socio-economic status and higher education levels of the main food provider whereas more\n\u2018unhealthy\u2019 patterns (\u2018snacks\u2019 and \u2018puddings\u2019) were associated with lower socio-economic status and lower education levels of the main food pro-\nvider. There was no consistent association between dietary patterns and BMI group or time spent in physical activity. However, inactivity (screen\ntime) was inversely associated with \u2018healthier\u2019 patterns in all age and sex groups and positively associated with \u2018puddings\u2019 and \u2018snacks\u2019 in girls aged\n5\u201311 years. Clear dietary patterns can be identified in school-age children in Scotland, which are consistently related to socio-economic factors and\ninactivity. This has implications for targeting health promotion at subgroups in terms of lifestyle changes required.\nDietary patterns: Principal components analysis: Children: Inactivity: Overweight\nTraditionally research on diet and health has focused on\nintakes of individual nutrients and\/or foods or food\ngroups. However, diet is complex and intake of individual\nnutrients or foods is not independent of intakes of other\nnutrients or foods. More recently a number of statistical\nmethods have been used to identify patterns of dietary beha-\nviour. The most popular of these is principal components\nanalysis (PCA)(1), a data-driven method which identifies\nfoods that are frequently eaten together by aggregating\nitems based on the degree to which the amounts consumed\nare correlated with one another. The aim of PCA is to\nidentify groups of food that account for the largest\namount of variation in overall diet between individuals.\nThis method has been mainly used in studies of diet in\nadult populations but has also been used previously to\nexplore dietary patterns in British, Spanish, Australian,\nKorean and Finnish children(2 \u2013 11).\nIn 2005, the Food Standards Agency Scotland commissioned\nthe \u2018Survey of Sugar Intake among Children in Scotland\u2019(12)\nto provide information on the diet of children in Scotland,\nwith a particular focus on the intake of non-milk extrinsic\nsugars and sugar-containing foods. The aims of the present\nstudy were to identify dietary patterns in school-age children\nfrom the survey and investigate associations with socio-\neconomic factors, physical activity and obesity.\nMethods\nA named sample of 2800 Scottish children aged between\n3 and 16 years on 1 May 2006 was drawn from eighty post-\ncode sectors across Scotland using the Department of Work\nand Pensions Child Benefit records. Only one child per house-\nhold was selected. After exclusions and an initial opt-out\nperiod, a FFQ (see below) was sent to the remaining sample\n*Corresponding author: Dr Leone Craig, fax \u00fe44 1224 559348, email l.craig@abdn.ac.uk\nAbbreviations: ALSPAC, Avon Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood; PCA, principal components analysis; SIMD, Scottish Index of Multiple\nDeprivation.\nBritish Journal of Nutrition (2010), 103, 319\u2013334 doi:10.1017\/S0007114509991942\nq The Authors 2009\nB\nri\nti\nsh\nJo\nu\nrn\nal\no\nf\nN\nu\ntr\nit\nio\nn\nof 2352 children, of whom a further sixty-five opted out and\nthe address was found to be incorrect for forty-two. Completed\nFFQ were collected by trained fieldworkers when they\nconducted a face-to-face interview in which information\non sociodemographic factors and physical activity levels was\ncollected and the child\u2019s height and weight measured.\nA total of 1700 interviews were carried out between May\nand September 2006 and 1512 FFQ were returned, giving a\ncombined response rate of 66 %.\nThe survey used two new versions of the Scottish Colla-\nborative Group FFQ, which has been widely used in epidemio-\nlogical studies in Scotland (http:\/\/www.foodfrequency.org.uk).\nVersion C2 for children aged 3\u201311 years was designed for\ncompletion by a parent or guardian with help from the child\nand version C3 for young people aged 12\u201317 years for com-\npletion by the young person with help from their parent or\nguardian. Version C2 lists 140 foods or drinks with a measure\ndefined for each item. Version C3 includes an additional six\nitems covering intake of coffee and alcoholic drinks.\nSocio-economic status was assessed using the 2006 Scottish\nIndex of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) based on postcode(13).\nData were analysed according to fifths of the distribution\n(quintiles). Respondents in the first quintile live in one of\nthe 20 % least deprived areas in Scotland while those in the\nfifth quintile live in one of the 20 % most deprived areas in\nScotland. Data were also analysed by quintiles of equivalised\nincome (a measure of household income adjusted for the\nnumber of individuals living in the household) and education\nlevel of the main food provider (based on the highest level of\nrecognised qualifications).\nThe questions on physical activity were the same as those\nused in the 1998 and 2003 Scottish Health Surveys(14 \u2013 15).\nInformation was collected on the number of days and the\ntime spent each day on the four different types of physical\nactivity thought to account for the largest part of children\u2019s\ntotal physical activity (sport\/exercise, active play, walking\nand housework\/gardening) over the previous 7 d. The physical\nactivity questions did not include any activity undertaken as\npart of the school curriculum. There was no lower time limit\nfor the inclusion of sport\/exercise or active play but only\nepisodes of housework\/gardening which lasted for at least\n15 min and walks of at least 5 min duration were included.\nAs a measure of physical inactivity, children were asked\nabout the average number of hours spent sitting in front of a\ntelevision or computer screen (other than at school) on an\naverage week day and on an average weekend day.\nBMI was calculated from measured height and weight.\nRespondents were classified using UK 1990 reference\ndata(16) as neither overweight nor obese (BMI , 85th centile\n(z-score , 1\u00b704)), overweight (BMI $ 85th centile and\n,95th centile (z-score $ 1\u00b704 and ,1\u00b764)) and obese\n(BMI $ 95th centile (z-score $ 1\u00b764)).\nThe study did not require the approval of a National Health\nService research ethics committee but was carried out in\naccordance with the research governance and quality-assur-\nance policies of the Scottish Centre for Social Research and\nthe Institute of Applied Health Sciences at the University of\nAberdeen (http:\/\/www.abdn.ac.uk\/iahs\/research-governance\/\ngovernance.shtml). After an initial opt out, consent was\nimplied by completion of the FFQ and written consent\nobtained for the interview and measurements.\nStatistical analysis\nIn line with standard operating procedures for the Scottish\nCollaborative Group FFQ, questionnaires with more than ten\nmissed lines were excluded from analysis (n 51 (3 %)).\nRespondents with extreme values of total energy intake\nbelow the 2\u00b75th centile or above the 97\u00b75th centile for age\ngroup (3\u20137, 8\u201311 or 12\u201317 years) were also excluded from\nthe analysis (n 70). Analysis of dietary patterns was carried\nout for school-age children; therefore children aged 3\u20134\nyears were excluded. After exclusion of outliers, incomplete\nquestionnaires and 3- to 4-year-old children, 1233 FFQ were\navailable for analysis.\nStatistical analysis was carried out using SPSS (version\n15.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA)(17). Data were weighted\nso that the estimates generated from the responding sample\nmore accurately reflected the characteristics of the population\nof children aged 3\u201316 years on 1 May 2006 in Scotland.\nWeights were calculated to take account of selection probabil-\nities and non-response bias and then combined to create a cali-\nbration weight which was applied in analyses. Further details\ncan be found in Appendix A of the survey report(12).\nPCA was carried out separately by age group (5\u201311 and\n12\u201317 years) and sex. The decision was made to explore\nthe dietary patterns separately by age group due to the ques-\ntionnaires differing slightly by age with an additional six\nitems in the older children\u2019s questionnaire and some differ-\nences in portion sizes for certain foods. In addition, dietary\npatterns were explored separately by sex within each age\ngroup due to an a priori assumption that patterns may be\ndifferent between the sexes.\nThe weight (g\/d) consumed for each item on the FFQ was\ncalculated by multiplying the frequency of consumption by\nthe portion weight. Missing lines were recoded as 0 g\/d for\nchildren with # ten missing lines.\nIn order to minimise the number of subjective decisions in\ndetermining the dietary patterns and retain the full detail of the\ndiet as assessed by the FFQ we chose to retain the majority of\nitems as they appeared on the FFQ. Food items consumed by\n,5 % of the sample were excluded (soya milk for all respon-\ndents and some alcoholic beverages and Marmite for 12- to\n17-year-olds). PCA was carried out using the weight (g\/d) of\nall remaining food items; 139 food items for 5- to 11-year-\nolds and 141 items for 12- to 17-year-olds. The number of\ncomponents was selected primarily by examination of scree\nplots(18), but the interpretability of the components was also\nconsidered. Where the number of components to choose was\nunclear from the scree plot, the effect of removing or adding\ncomponents on the content of the components and therefore\nease of interpretation was assessed. Rotation was carried out\nusing Varimax orthogonal rotation(19). Factor loadings\n,20\u00b73 and .0\u00b73 were used to define the patterns. The\nfactor scores for each component for each child were used\nin subsequent analyses.\nTests of association were carried out using the Complex\nSamples option in SPSS to take account of sample design\nand response weighting variables. Associations between\nfactor scores and SIMD quintile, income quintile and edu-\ncation level of the main food provider were assessed using\nComplex Samples general linear model (ANOVA) for\nindividual associations and Complex Samples general linear\nL.

The associ-\nations between factor scores and physical activity and BMI\nclassification were assessed using Complex Samples general\nlinear model (analysis of covariance) adjusting for age at\ninterview and SIMD, again looking at the linear trend across\nthe groups.\nResults\nPCA identified three dietary patterns in each age and sex\ngroup (Table 1 and Appendix 1). The three patterns accounted\nfor 11\u00b76 and 13\u00b70 % of the variance, respectively, in boys and\ngirls aged 5\u201311 years, and 14\u00b74 and 15\u00b71 % of the variance,\nrespectively, in boys and girls aged 12\u201317 years.\nThe first component accounted for 5\u00b71\u20136\u00b72 % of the\nvariance in the separate groups; for girls aged 12\u201317 years\neach of the three factors accounted for approximately the\nsame amount of variance (5 %), whereas in the other groups\nthe second and third factors accounted for progressively less\nof the variance.\nThe components were assigned labels based on the\nfoods with high loadings within that component. For boys\nand girls aged 5\u201311 years and boys aged 12\u201317 years\nthe first component was characterised by high intakes of\n\u2018healthier\u2019 foods such as fruit and vegetables; however,\nfor girls aged 12\u201317 years the first component was character-\nised by high intakes of more \u2018unhealthy\u2019 foods such\nas puddings.\nFor most of the groups at least one of the other two patterns\nidentified was a more \u2018unhealthy\u2019 \u2018snacks\u2019 or \u2018puddings\u2019\npattern. For 5- to 11-year-old boys a third \u2018fish and\nsauce\u2019 pattern was identified and for 12- to 17-year-old boys\na third pattern loading highly for \u2018starchy food and drinks\u2019\nwas identified.\nFor boys and girls aged 5\u201311 years and boys aged\n12\u201317 years fruit and vegetables loaded highly within\nthe same component (component 1), although for 12- to\n17-year-old boys there was a predominance of vegetables;\nhowever, for girls aged 12\u201317 years fruit and vegetables\nloaded highly in separate components (components 2 and 3,\nrespectively).\nAssociation between dietary patterns and socio-economic\nindicators\nTable 2 shows the relationship between the dietary\ncomponents and SIMD by age and sex group.\nIn boys and girls aged 5\u201311 years the \u2018fruit and vegetables\u2019\ncomponent was associated with lower levels of deprivation\nand the \u2018snacks\u2019 component was associated with higher\nlevels of deprivation. In girls aged 5\u201311 years the \u2018puddings\u2019\ncomponent was also associated with higher levels of depri-\nvation. In boys and girls aged 12\u201317 years the \u2018vegetables\u2019\ncomponent was associated with lower levels of deprivation\nand the \u2018puddings\u2019 component was associated with higher\nlevels of deprivation.\nAn almost identical relationship was found between the\ndietary patterns and quintiles of household income (data not\nshown), with income positively associated with the \u2018fruit\nand vegetables\u2019 component in 5- to 11-year-olds (P for\nlinear trend 0\u00b7008 boys and 0\u00b7014 girls) and the \u2018vegetables\u2019\ncomponent in 12- to 17-year-olds (P for linear trend ,0\u00b7001\nboys and 0\u00b7008 girls) and inversely associated with the\n\u2018puddings\u2019 component in girls of both ages and 12- to\n17-year-old boys (P for linear trend 0\u00b7002 5- to 11-year-old\ngirls, ,0\u00b7001 12- to 17-year-old girls and 0\u00b7001 12- to\n17-year-old boys) and the \u2018snacks\u2019 component in 5- to\n11-year-old boys (P for linear trend ,0\u00b7001).\nAgain a similar relationship was found with education level\nof the main food provider (Table 3). The \u2018fruit and vegetables\u2019\npattern in 5- to 11-year-old girls and the \u2018vegetables\u2019 pattern\nin 12- to 17-year-olds were most likely to be followed by\nchildren whose main food provider was educated to degree\nlevel. In contrast, the \u2018snacks\u2019 and \u2018puddings\u2019 patterns were\nmost likely to be followed by children whose main food\nprovider had no qualification.\nThe \u2018fish and sauce\u2019 component in 5- to 11-year-old boys,\nthe \u2018starchy food and drinks\u2019 component in 12- to 17-year-\nold boys and the \u2018fruit\u2019 component in 12- to 17-year-old\ngirls showed no significant association with any of the\nsocio-economic indicators.\nIn order to assess any independent associations, all three\nsocio-economic indicators were entered into the same model\n(data not shown). In younger children aged 5\u201311 years the\neducation level of the main food provider seemed to be the\nsocio-economic indicator most associated with dietary patterns\nafter adjustment for the other indicators. It remained signifi-\ncantly related to the \u2018fruit and vegetables\u2019 patterns in boys\nand girls (P for linear trend 0\u00b7001 boys and 0\u00b7013 girls) and\nthe \u2018snacks\u2019 and \u2018puddings\u2019 patterns in girls (P for linear\ntrend 0\u00b7020 and 0\u00b7027, respectively). However, household\nincome was significantly related to the \u2018snacks\u2019 pattern in\nboys (P for linear trend 0\u00b7025) and SIMD to the \u2018snacks\u2019 pat-\ntern in girls (P for linear trend 0\u00b7012). In older children aged\n12\u201317 years, however, household income was the only indi-\ncator which remained significant after adjustment for the\nother indicators, with the \u2018vegetables\u2019 component in 12- to\n17-year-old boys (P for linear trend 0\u00b7003) and the \u2018puddings\u2019\ncomponent in 12- to 17-year-old boys and girls (P for linear\ntrend 0\u00b7024 boys and 0\u00b7041 girls) remaining significantly\nassociated with income.\nTable 1.

In all age and sex\ngroups, components loading highly for fruit and\/or vegetables\nwere inversely associated with time spent in front of a\nscreen. In girls aged 5\u201311 years the \u2018puddings\u2019 and \u2018snacks\u2019\ncomponents were positively associated with more time spent\nin front of a screen.\nAssociation between dietary patterns and overweight and\nobesity\nThe only significant association between BMI group and diet-\nary patterns was found in boys aged 5\u201311 years, in whom\nthere was a significant linear association between \u2018snacks\u2019\nand BMI group, with the lowest factor score in obese children,\ni.e. obese children ate less of the snack foods associated with\nthis component (P for linear trend 0\u00b7047). There was also a\nsignificant linear association between \u2018fish and sauce\u2019 and\nBMI group, with the highest factor score in obese children\n(P for linear trend 0\u00b7023).\nDiscussion\nFor most of the age and sex groups, one \u2018healthy\u2019 dietary pat-\ntern characterised by high intakes of foods such as fruit and\nvegetables was identified and this was usually the first pattern\nexplaining the greatest variance. At least one of the other\ntwo patterns identified was a more \u2018unhealthy\u2019 \u2018snacks\u2019 or\n\u2018puddings\u2019 pattern consisting mainly of high-fat and\/or high-\nsugar energy-dense foods. For younger boys a third \u2018fish\nand sauce\u2019 pattern was identified and for older boys a third\n\u2018starchy food and drinks\u2019 pattern was identified.\nOlder girls (aged 12\u201317 years) differed from the other\ngroups with respect to the dietary patterns identified in that\nthe first component was a more \u2018unhealthy\u2019 pattern loading\nhighly for puddings, although the percentage variance\nexplained did not differ much from the second and third com-\nponents. Each of the three factors in older girls accounted for\napproximately the same amount of variance (5 %), whereas for\nthe other groups the first component accounted for 5\u00b72\u20136\u00b72 %\nof the variance, with the other components accounting for less.\nAlso for older girls fruit and vegetables loaded highly in\nseparate components, whereas for the other groups fruit and\nvegetables loaded highly within the same component,\nalthough for 12- to 17-year-old boys there was a predomi-\nnance of vegetables.\nThe three dietary patterns identified for each age and sex\ngroup only accounted for 12\u201315 % of the variance; however,\nthe low variance explained is not unique to the present study,\nas dietary patterns derived using PCA generally tend to\naccount for only a small amount of the total variance of diet\nin a dataset(1). Therefore, results should be interpreted with\ncaution, as other patterns exist within the data which may indi-\nvidually explain less of the variance but jointly account for a\nsubstantial proportion of the variation between individuals.\nThe variance explained in the present study was very slightly\nlower than that of three factors identified at 4, 7 and 9 years of\nage in the ALSPAC Study children (17\u00b77 % at 4 years, 18\u00b71 %\nat 7 years and 19\u00b72 % at 9 years)(4) and three factors identified\nin an Australian study of 12- to 18-year-olds which accounted\nfor 21\u00b77 % of the variance(7). However, this is most probably\ndue to the larger number of food items used in the PCA\nin the present study, as it has been shown that with\nmore items the lower the proportion of variance explained;\nhowever, prior grouping of foods may attenuate relationships\nbetween derived patterns and outcome variables(20). As we\nchose not to pre-group the foods before analysis there were\napproximately 140 input variables, whereas the Australian\nstudy had eighty-six items(7) and the ALSPAC Study approxi-\nmately forty(4).\nThe dietary patterns found by the ALSPAC Study at age 4,\n7 and 9 years of age were \u2018processed\u2019 (originally named\n\u2018junk\u2019), \u2018health conscious\u2019 and \u2018traditional\u2019(4). At age\n3 years a fourth \u2018snacks\u2019 pattern was found(2). The foods\nthat made up the \u2018processed\u2019 pattern are similar to those in\nthe \u2018snacks\u2019 and \u2018puddings\u2019 patterns in the present study.\nThe \u2018traditional\u2019 pattern contained meat, poultry, potato and\nvegetables whilst the \u2018health conscious\u2019 pattern loaded\nhighly for fruit, vegetables, fish, pasta and rice at ages 3, 4\nand 7 and inversely with meats at 9 years. The three dietary\npatterns identified in the Australian study of 12- to 18-year-\nolds were a \u2018fruit, salad, cereals and fish\u2019 pattern, a \u2018high\nfat and sugar\u2019 pattern and a \u2018vegetables\u2019 pattern(7). The\nresults from these two studies and the present one suggest\nthat intake of vegetables may be highly correlated with the\nintake of fruit in younger children but not necessarily in\nolder children.\nThe present study found significant relationships between\ndietary patterns and socio-economic indicators. In general,\n\u2018healthier\u2019 dietary patterns (\u2018fruit and vegetables\u2019) were\nassociated with lower levels of deprivation, higher incomes\nand higher education levels of the main food provider whereas\nmore \u2018unhealthy\u2019 dietary patterns (\u2018snacks\u2019 and \u2018puddings\u2019)\nshowed the opposite association. It should be noted, however,\nthat although there were clear associations between dietary\npatterns and socio-economic status, the survey did not find\nas clear an association between socio-economic status and\nnutrient intakes, with a small increase in non-milk extrinsic\nsugars intake with increasing deprivation measured by SIMD\nand no difference in total fat or SFA intakes(12) which is\nalso consistent with data from other surveys(21).\nIn older girls, where fruit and vegetables loaded highly in\nseparate components, socio-economic factors were related\nto \u2018vegetables\u2019 but not \u2018fruit\u2019, suggesting that intake of\nvegetables may be more influenced by socio-economic factors\nthan intake of fruit. Very few other studies have investigated\nfruit and vegetables separately and most other studies of diet-\nary patterns have found that fruit and vegetables aggregate\ntogether in the same component, similar to most of the sub-\ngroups in the present study. However, the results from the\nmain analysis of the survey looking at individual food\ngroups showed a stronger socio-economic gradient for\nvegetables than fruit in these children(12).\nL. C. A.

The\nALSPAC Study(2 \u2013 3) found that their \u2018junk\u2019 (renamed \u2018pro-\ncessed\u2019) pattern was related to socially disadvantaged house-\nholds (council housing, financial difficulties, lower levels of\nmaternal education), whereas their \u2018healthy\u2019 component was\nassociated with higher maternal education levels. A Spanish\nstudy of 2-to 24-year-olds found similar associations with\nmaternal education levels(6). Those children whose mother\nhad a lower education level were more likely to have a\n\u2018snacky\u2019 pattern and less likely to have a \u2018healthy\u2019 pattern.\nHowever, the Australian study of 12- to 18-year-olds failed\nto find an association between the three dietary patterns ident-\nified in their sample and socio-economic indicators(7).\nIn younger children education level of the main food provi-\nder seemed to be the socio-economic indicator most associated\nwith dietary patterns after adjustment for the other indicators;\nhowever, in older children household income was the only\nindicator which remained significant after adjustment for the\nother socio-economic indicators. It is conceivable that as\nchildren age and become more independent and make more\nof their own food choices the amount of money available to\nthem may become more of an issue and perhaps their own\neducation level becomes more important than that of a\nparent. Most other studies have considered only one age\ngroup, focusing either on younger or older children and\noften considering different socio-economic indicators\nseparately; therefore it is difficult to compare these findings.\nHowever, as highlighted earlier, the ALSPAC Study(2 \u2013 3)\nfound that maternal education levels in particular were associ-\nated with dietary patterns in children up to 7 years of age\nand the enKid Study found that maternal education levels\nwere associated with dietary patterns in 2- to 24-year-olds\nin Spain(6).\nThe present study found significant linear relationships\nbetween dietary patterns and physical activity and inactivity,\nwith associations being more consistent with inactivity.\n\u2018Healthier\u2019 dietary patterns were consistently associated\nwith less time spent in front of a screen for all age and\nsex groups whereas more \u2018unhealthy\u2019 dietary patterns were\nassociated with more time spent in front of a screen for\ngirls aged 5\u201311 years. However, time spent in physical\nactivity was positively related to the \u2018snacks\u2019 component in\n5- to 11-year-olds of both sexes and the \u2018fruit and vegetables\u2019\ncomponent in 5- to 11-year-old girls.\nFew studies have examined associations between dietary\npatterns identified by PCA and physical activity. The Spanish\nstudy of 2- to 24-year-olds(6) found that their \u2018snacky\u2019 pattern\nwas positively associated with time spent watching television\nin all ages and their \u2018healthy\u2019 pattern inversely associated with\ntime spent watching television in 2- to 13-year-olds. Similar to\nthe present study, the Australian study of adolescents(7) failed\nto find a consistent association between dietary patterns and\nphysical activity in 15- to 18-year-olds, with only their \u2018high\nfat and sugar\u2019 pattern being associated with higher levels of\nphysical activity. In general, other studies have concentrated\non the relationship between diet and inactivity (usually\nmeasured by television viewing), with few looking at the\nrelationship with physical activity. More \u2018unhealthy\u2019 diets\nhave been found to be associated with greater time spent\nwatching television(22 \u2013 25).\nThere was little association between dietary patterns and\noverweight and obesity. The only significant relationships\nwere in boys aged 5\u201311 years, with the lowest intake of\n\u2018snacks\u2019 and the highest intake of \u2018fish and sauce\u2019 in obese\nchildren. The few other studies that have looked at dietary pat-\nterns identified by PCA in relation to obesity in children have\nalso failed to find significant associations(5 \u2013 7) apart from one\nwhich found a positive association between an \u2018animal foods\u2019\npattern and overweight in Korean preschool children(9).\nAnother study utilising cluster analysis also failed to find a\nsignificant association between dietary patterns and BMI in\nGerman children(26). The lack of an association between diet\nand BMI could be due to the fact that the data are cross-\nsectional. The results could be influenced by dieting and\/or\nunder-reporting, particularly in the overweight and obese chil-\ndren, but as no information was collected on dieting behaviour\nand no adjustment of the data has been made for possible\nunder-reporting, the results should be interpreted with caution.\nHowever, in general there is a lack of consistent association\nbetween diet and BMI in children in the literature(27 \u2013 28).\nThere are several strengths and limitations of PCA which\nare discussed in detail by other authors(1,29). One of its main\nlimitations is that it involves several subjective decisions, in\nparticular choosing the number of components to retain and\nnaming them and, also, grouping of foods if researchers\nchoose to do so. As mentioned earlier, in order to minimise\nthe number of subjective decisions we chose not to pre-\ngroup the foods before analysis. However, PCA requires a\nlarge sample size due to the fact that the analysis is based\non a correlation matrix of the variables, and correlations\nusually need a large sample size before they stabilize. It has\nbeen suggested that a sample size of 200 is fair and 300 is\ngood(30), but it has also been suggested that the ratio\nof sample size to the number of variables is important, with\nanything from two to ten subjects per variable being\nrecommended(31). The sample sizes for the various age and\nsex groups in the present study ranged from 250 to 381, mean-\ning that they were fair to good by the first definition; however,\nas there were approximately 140 items on the FFQ this would\nneed 280\u20131400 subjects to fulfill the second criteria for\nsample size. The minimum number of 280 was achieved in\nthe younger age groups but not quite in the older children.\nPre-grouping the foods may have meant that some of these\nnew groups would have contributed more to components\nthan individual items; however, it would not be clear which\nof the foods within these new groupings were most important.\nThe main advantage of PCA is that it combines information\nacross the diet based on food intakes, taking into account\nthe complexity of the diet and revealing underlying food\nconsumption patterns, meaning that it may be more relevant\nto dietary choices than analyses based on individual foods\nand\/or nutrients.\nThere are two main approaches to dietary patterns,\neither a hypothesis-driven a priori approach, or an\nempirical a posteriori approach(1,29,32). In the hypothesis-\ndriven a priori approach, the diet is given a score based on\nthe degree to which it conforms to dietary recommendations\nsuch as the Healthy Eating Index(33), the Diet Quality\nIndex(34) or the Mediterranean Diet Score(35) and this score\nis used as an exposure variable. The score does not reflect\noverall diet, but rather specific aspects of it that are thought\nDietary patterns in children in Scotland 327\nB\nri\nti\nsh\nJo\nu\nrn\nal\no\nf\nN\nu\ntr\nit\nio\nn\nto represent a healthy diet. This method, however, is limited\nby current knowledge of diet\u2013disease relationships and the\nchoice of which foods and\/or nutrients to include in the\nscore and what cut-off points to apply. The empirical approach\nrelies entirely on data, and patterns are derived using statistical\ntechniques. PCA is the most popular of these approaches\nbut cluster analysis is also commonly used. Cluster analysis\ndiffers from PCA in that it aggregates individuals into\nmutually exclusive subgroups or clusters with similar diets\nrather than grouping foods that are consumed together.\nIndividuals can only belong to one cluster; therefore, there\ncan be a risk of misclassification which does not exist\nfor PCA. Further analysis such as comparing profiles across\nclusters is required to interpret these patterns, whereas in PCA\nthe patterns are directly interpretable. A more recent addition\nto dietary pattern methodology is reduced rank regression(36).\nThis is of most use when studying diet\u2013disease relationships,\nas it takes account of biological pathways by identifying\npatterns associated with biomarkers of disease. It is therefore\nconsidered a combination of a priori and a posteriori methods.\nHowever, it requires information on disease biomarkers.\nUsing PCA to generate dietary patterns shows which foods\ntend to be eaten together, and relating these patterns to other\nfactors such as demographics, lifestyle and health helps to\ntailor and set priorities for health promotion and also to\nbetter understand the role of diet in relation to disease risk.\nIn conclusion, distinct dietary patterns could be identified in\nschool-age children, which differed slightly between age and\nsex groups. The predominant dietary pattern seemed to be a\n\u2018healthy\u2019 one containing vegetables, in combination with fruit\nfor the younger children. This pattern was consistently associ-\nated with higher socio-economic status (less deprivation, higher\nincome and higher education level of the main food provider)\nand less time spent in inactivity. Although clear associations\nwere found between dietary patterns and socio-economic fac-\ntors, it should be noted that this does not necessarily translate\ninto large differences in nutrient intakes between socio-econ-\nomic groups; therefore analyses of dietary patterns should be\ncombined with analyses of nutrients, as studying either one\nalone could be misleading. This may have important impli-\ncations for targeting health promotion messages at subgroups\nin terms of changes required to current food intakes. Clear\nassociations between \u2018unhealthy\u2019 dietary patterns and inactivity\nwere found but there were no consistent associations between\ndietary patterns and physical activity except for the suggestion\nin younger children that more unhealthy \u2018snacks\u2019 patterns were\npositively associated with physical activity. This suggests that\n\u2018healthy\u2019 lifestyle factors do not necessarily cluster together\nin the same children but \u2018unhealthy\u2019 ones do tend to cluster\ntogether. This also has implications for health promotion strat-\negies in children which should focus on \u2018healthy\u2019 lifestyles\nincluding both diet and physical activity messages.\nAcknowledgements\nThe original study and secondary analysis were funded by the\nFood Standards Agency Scotland (contracts S14029 and\nS14039).\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the statistical advice\nfrom Dr Andrea Sherriff, University of Glasgow and Dr Lorna\nAucott, University of Aberdeen.\nG.
