INTRODUCTION\nMesoscopic systems exhibit variations in their phase-\ncoherent electronic transport properties that are con-\nveniently characterized via statistical approaches. Ge-\nometries that classically give rise to chaotic motion typ-\nically display universal fluctuations which can be cap-\ntured using ensembles of random scattering matrices [1].\nFor normal conductors the universal properties fall into\nDyson\u2019s three universality classes with symmetry index\n\u03b2 = 1, 2, 4 [2], while a further seven universality classes\ncan be identified in the presence of superconducting or\nchiral particle-hole symmetries [3]. A powerful tool to\ndistinguish these ensembles is the amount of level re-\npulsion between the transmission eigenvalues Tn. These\neigenvalues determine fundamental transport properties\nsuch as the conductance G or the shot-noise Fano fac-\ntor F [1, 4]. In the Dyson ensembles, the probability\ndensity to find two closely spaced adjacent transmission\neigenvalues with small distance s = Tn+1 \u2212 Tn is sup-\npressed as P (s) \u221d s\u03b2 [5, 6]. This introduces a stiffness\nin the transmission-eigenvalue sequence which suppresses\nthe fluctuations of the conductance and of the Fano factor\nwhen compared to the case of uncorrelated transmission\neigenvalues (the latter being characteristic for classically\nintegrable systems with a complete set of good quantum\nnumbers) [1, 4].\nFrom the investigation of closed systems it is well\nknown that discrete symmetries result in a reduction of\nlevel repulsion. In such systems, desymmetrization deliv-\ners independent variants of the system which differ by the\nboundary conditions on the symmetry lines (e.g., Dirich-\nlet and Neumann boundary conditions for eigenfunctions\nof odd and even parity, respectively). The statistics of the\ndesymmetrized versions can depend on the dimensional-\nity of the irreducible representation [7], but still remain\nwithin the conventional universality classes. The com-\nbined level statistics is then built by superimposing the\nindependent level sequences of the desymmetrized vari-\nants [5]. In open systems, this concept of desymmetriza-\ntion can be directly applied as long as the symmetry in\nquestion preserves the shape and position of the leads\n[8, 9].\nThis paper is motivated by the observation that sys-\ntems with a lead-transposing symmetry (which maps dif-\nferent openings onto each other while leaving the dynam-\nics in the system unchanged) exhibit transport properties\nthat can only be understood as collective features of the\ndesymmetrized variants of the system [8, 9]. An obvi-\nous indication of this complication is the fact that the\nsymmetry-reduced variants only possess a reduced num-\nber of leads (we concentrate on systems with two leads,\nfor which the desymmetrized variants only possess a sin-\ngle lead). We demonstrate that such systems exhibit nev-\nertheless a reduced repulsion of transmission eigenvalues\nwhich is similar to that for systems with a lead-preserving\nsymmetry. For a large number N of transport chan-\nnels, the local statistical fluctuations in the eigenvalue\nsequence indeed become indistinguishable for both types\nof symmetry. However, for a small numbers of channels,\nthe statistics differ from each other, which can be traced\nback to the absence or presence of 1\/N corrections in\nthese ensembles.\nIn the specific case of \u03b2 = 1, we derive exact closed ex-\npressions for the joint probability density of transmission\neigenvalues thereby gaining detailed insight into these\nstatistical features. In particular, we find for both the\nlead-preserving and the lead-transposing symmetry class\nthat level repulsion occurs only between every second\ntransmission eigenvalue. The fluctuations in the trans-\nmission eigenvalue sequence hence find their most natu-\nral statistical interpretation in a staggered superposition\n2of two independent level sequences. In such a superposi-\ntion, the transmission eigenvalues alternate between the\ntwo sequences when they are ordered by magnitude.\nThe exact expressions for the joint probability density\nwith \u03b2 = 1 are different for the two types of symme-\ntry. Hence, the details of the transport statistics for a\nlead-transposing symmetry deviate from those for a lead-\npreserving symmetry. We show that these deviations are\nmost significant for a small number of channels, while for\na large number of channels the local eigenvalue statistics\ndo indeed converge onto each other.\nPrevious studies of open systems with lead-transposing\nor lead-preserving symmetries have derived the distri-\nbution of transmission eigenvalues for one or two open\nchannels and the one-point density for arbitrary numbers\nof channels [8\u201311]. For time-reversal symmetric systems\nwith \u03b2 = 1, a key observation of these works was an\nenhancement of universal fluctuations for both types of\nsymmetry (when compared to asymmetric systems). For\nsystems with a lead-transposing symmetry it was found\nthat the weak localization correction is vanishing, lead-\ning to ensemble averaged expressions for the conductance\nand for the shot noise Fano factor which are entirely in-\ndependent of the channel number N [11]. The underlying\nstaggered level statistics embodied in the joint distribu-\ntion of transmission eigenvalues provides a unifying ex-\nplanation for all of these observations. We verify our\npredictions by numerical computations for quantum bil-\nliards [12, 13] and for the open kicked rotator [14\u201316].\nThis paper is organized as follows. Section II provides\nbackground information on the scattering approach to\ntransport and on standard random-matrix theory. In Sec.\nIII we revisit the case of systems with a lead-preserving\nsymmetry and provide the exact reformulation of the\neigenvalue statistics in the orthogonal symmetry class\n(\u03b2 = 1) as a staggered superposition of two eigenvalue\nsequences. Section IV concerns systems with a lead-\ntransposing symmetry. In particular, for \u03b2 = 1 we derive\nthe exact joint probability density of transmission eigen-\nvalues for arbitrary N , and show that this again takes the\nform of a staggered eigenvalue sequence. We also describe\nthe convergence of the local statistics for both types of\nsymmetry, which emerges in the limit N \u2192 \u221e. Section\nV provides numerical results that illustrate the similari-\nties and differences of the random-matrix ensembles for\nthe two symmetry classes. This section also contains the\ncomparison to specific model systems. Section VI pro-\nvides a summary and discussion of our main results.\nII. BASIC CONCEPTS\nA. Scattering approach to transport\nFigure 1 depicts open two-dimensional quantum bil-\nliards representing mesoscopic systems with two attached\nleads (L \u2013 left and R \u2013 right), each carrying N in-\ncoming and N outgoing modes. The systems in Fig.\n( a ) ( b )\n( e ) ( f )\n( d )( c )\nL R\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Sketches of quantum billiards (a,b)\nwithout any spatial symmetry, (c) with a lead-preserving\nsymmetry, (d) with both a lead-preserving as well as a lead-\ntransposing symmetry, (e) with a lead-transposing reflection\nsymmetry, and (f) with a lead-transposing inversion symme-\ntry. The inversion symmetry in panel (f) survives in the pres-\nence of a finite magnetic field, as is indicated by a symmetric\npair of trajectories.\n1(a,b) are asymmetric while those in Fig. 1(e,f) possess\na lead-transposing reflection or inversion symmetry, re-\nspectively. In the middle panels, Fig. 1(c) shows a system\nwith a lead-preserving symmetry, and Fig. 1(d) shows a\nsystem which possesses both a lead-preserving (up-down)\nand a lead-transposing (right-left) symmetry.\nIn order to describe the phase-coherent transport\nthrough these systems for small bias voltage V , one solves\nthe Schro\u00a8dinger equation for fixed values of the 2N am-\nplitudes a = [a(L)n , a\n(R)\nn ]T in the incoming modes. This\nresults in linear relations b = Sa for the 2N amplitudes\nb = [b(L)n , b\n(R)\nn ]T in the outgoing modes, which delivers a\n2N \u00d7 2N -dimensional scattering matrix of the form\nS =\n(\nr t\u2032\nt r\u2032\n)\n. (1)\nHere r, r\u2032, t, t\u2032 are N\u00d7N -dimensional matrices describing\nreflection at each lead and transmission from one lead to\nthe other, respectively.\nThe scattering matrix is unitary, and its structure is\nfurther constrained by symmetries of the system. The\nthree main universality classes arise for systems with\ntime-reversal and spin-rotation symmetry (orthogonal\nsymmetry class with S = ST , symmetry index \u03b2 = 1),\nsystems without time-reversal symmetry (unitary sym-\nmetry class with no constraints on S, \u03b2 = 2), and sys-\ntems with time-reversal but broken spin-rotation sym-\nmetry (symplectic symmetry class composed of self-dual\nmatrices S = SR, \u03b2 = 4). Spatial symmetries entail ad-\nditional constraints on the scattering matrix, which are\ndetailed in Secs. III and IV.\n3The transmission eigenvalues Tn are defined as the\neigenvalues of the hermitian matrix tt\u2020. In the case of\nspin-independent transport or Kramers degeneracy (the\nlatter occurs for \u03b2 = 4), the transmission eigenvalues are\ntwofold degenerate. We then only account for each pair\nof eigenvalues once and introduce a spin-degeneracy fac-\ntor \u03b1 = 2. When the two-fold degeneracy is lifted then\n\u03b1 = 1. From here on, N refers to the number of distinct\ntransmission eigenvalues (ignoring accidental degenera-\ncies). Furthermore we will assume that the transmission\neigenvalues are ordered by magnitude,\nT1 \u2264 T2 \u2264 T3 \u2264 . . . \u2264 TN , (2)\nas this results in a number of technical simplifications.\nThe conductance quantum is defined as G0 = \u03b1e2\/h.\nWith these conventions, the transmission eigenvalues\ndetermine fundamental transport properties such as the\nconductance via\nG = G0\nN\u2211\nn=1\nTn (3)\nand the shot-noise power via\nP = 2G0eV\nN\u2211\nn=1\nTn(1\u2212 Tn). (4)\nHere V is the bias voltage, which is assumed to be small.\nB. Dyson\u2019s circular ensembles\nRandom-matrix theory delivers a statistical descrip-\ntion of transport by drawing the scattering matrices from\nensembles of unitary matrices which obey the constraints\nof the given universality class. For the three main univer-\nsality classes with \u03b2 = 1, 2, or 4, random-matrix theory\nis based on Dyson\u2019s circular ensembles, for which the\nprobability measure is given by the Haar measure of uni-\ntary symmetric, unitary, or unitary self-dual matrices,\nrespectively. The joint probability density of transmis-\nsion eigenvalues then takes the form [1]\nP ({Tn}) \u221d\n\u220f\nm>n\n(Tm \u2212 Tn)\u03b2\n\u220f\nl\nT\n\u22121+\u03b2\/2\nl . (5)\nThe first product in Eq. (5) involves pairs of transmis-\nsion eigenvalues and favors sequences in which neighbor-\ning transmission eigenvalues do not approach each other\nclosely. (As we have ordered the transmission eigenval-\nues by magnitude, all differences Tm \u2212 Tn are positive.)\nThis suppresses fluctuations in the eigenvalue sequence\nand ultimately results in conductance fluctuations of the\norder of a single conductance quantum, which for large\nN approach the asymptotic value\nvarG\/G0 =\n1\n8\u03b2\n. (6)\nFor large N , the one-point probability density of trans-\nmission eigenvalues approaches\nP (T ) =\n1\npi\n\u221a\nT (1\u2212 T ) . (7)\nThe second product in Eq. (5) induces an asymmetry into\nthis bi-modal distribution, which for large N results in\nthe weak-localization correction\n\u3008G\u3009 \u2212 N\n2\nG0 = G0\n(\n1\n4\n\u2212 1\n2\u03b2\n)\n(8)\nof the ensemble-averaged conductance.\nAn insightful quantity derived from the joint proba-\nbility density P ({Tn}) is the distribution P (s) of spac-\nings s = Tn+1 \u2212 Tn between neighboring transmission\neigenvalues. For uncorrelated eigenvalues with average\nspacing s\u00af one would expect a Poisson distribution,\nP (s) = s\u00af\u22121e\u2212s\/s\u00af, (9)\nwhile for the circular ensembles and N \u00c0 1, the spac-\ning distribution can be well approximated by the Wigner\ndistributions [5, 6],\nP (s) =\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\npi\n2s\u00af2 s exp\n(\n\u2212pis24s\u00af2\n)\n\u03b2 = 1\n32\npi2s\u00af3 s\n2 exp\n(\n\u2212 4s2pis\u00af2\n)\n\u03b2 = 2\n218\n36pi3s\u00af5 s\n4 exp\n(\n\u2212 64s29pis\u00af2\n)\n\u03b2 = 4\n. (10)\nLead-preserving and lead-transposing symmetries en-\ntail further constraints on the scattering matrix. The\nconsequences of these constraints for the transmission\neigenvalue statistics are explored in the remainder of this\npaper.\nIII. LEAD-PRESERVING SYMMETRIES\nA useful reference point for our subsequent investiga-\ntion of systems with a lead-transposing symmetry (in Sec.\nIV) are open systems with a lead-preserving symmetry,\nto which one can directly apply the standard ideas of\ndesymmetrization. The goal of the present section is to\nreformulate the resulting random-matrix statistics for the\ncase of a lead-preserving symmetry with \u03b2 = 1 as a stag-\ngered level repulsion, as this will allow us to establish a\nconnection to the case of a lead-transposing symmetry.\nA. Constraints on the scattering matrix\nAn example of a system with a lead-preserving reflec-\ntion symmetry is shown in Fig. 1 (c). Figure 2 (a,b)\nshows the desymmetrized version of the system, which\nis halved at the symmetry line. Dirichlet boundary con-\nditions on the line of symmetry select scattering wave\nfunctions with an odd parity, while Neumann boundary\n4( a ) ( b )\nD i r i c h l e t N e u m a n n\n( c )\n( d )\nT n\nT n\no d d  p a r i t y\ne v e n  p a r i t y\ne v e n  i n d e x\no d d  i n d e x\nFIG. 2: (Color online) (a,b) Desymmetrization of the quan-\ntum billiard with a lead-preserving reflection symmetry,\nshown in Fig. 1(c). (c) Sketch of the individual transmis-\nsion eigenvalue sequences of fixed parity. (d) Reorganization\nas a staggered level sequence, where transmission eigenvalues\nalternate after ordering by magnitude.\nconditions yield even parity. Consequently, the transmis-\nsion matrix t assumes a block structure where each block\ncorresponds to a given parity. As dictated by the one-\ndimensional transverse-mode quantization in the leads,\nthe block of even parity has dimension N1 \u2261 [(N +1)\/2],\nwhile the block of odd parity has dimension N2 \u2261 [N\/2]\n(here [\u00b7] denotes the integer part of a number). Hence,\nboth blocks have either the same size (when N = N1+N2\nis even), or the block with even parity is by one larger\nthan the block with odd parity (when N is odd).\nThe total transmission-eigenvalue sequence is therefore\nobtained from a superposition of two sequences of size\nN1 and N2 [for illustration see Fig. 2(c)]. In order to\nfix the way we address the elements of this superposi-\ntion, we impose the ordering of Eq. (2) and denote by\nP the set of all strictly increasing sequences of indices\nIn \u2208 {1, 2, 3, . . . , N}, where each sequence is of length\nN1. Such sequences are of the form I = (I1, I2, . . . , IN1),\nwhere 1 \u2264 I1 < I2 < I3 < . . . < IN1 \u2264 N . For\neach sequence we also define a complementary sequence\nI\u00af = (I\u00af1, I\u00af2, I\u00af3, . . . , I\u00afN2), which consists of the indices\n1 \u2264 I\u00af1 < I\u00af2 < I\u00af3 < . . . < I\u00afN2 \u2264 N not contained in\nI. This partition delivers two ordered subsequences TIn\nand TI\u00afn .\nB. Conventional random-matrix theory\nWithin random-matrix theory, the joint probability\ndistribution of the total transmission-eigenvalue sequence\nis the sum of the corresponding probabilities for each way\nto distribute the transmission eigenvalues into two sets\ncontaining N1 and N2 eigenvalues. With each sequence\nobeying the statistics of the appropriate Dyson ensemble\none finds with Eq. (5)\nP ({Tn}) \u221d\n\u2211\nI\u2208P\n\u220f\nm>n\n(TIm \u2212 TIn)\u03b2\n\u220f\nm>n\n(\nTI\u00afm \u2212 TI\u00afn\n)\u03b2\n\u00d7\nN\u220f\nl=1\nT\n\u22121+\u03b2\/2\nl . (11)\nFor large N , the separation into two effectively inde-\npendent systems with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary\nconditions naturally results in a doubling of the con-\nductance fluctuations (6) and a doubling of the weak-\nlocalization correction (8). Moreover, level repulsion is\nonly effective for transmission eigenvalues which are part\nof the same sequence. This modifies the spacing proba-\nbility density, which can be calculated from the general\nexpression [5]\nP (s) =\nd2\nds2\n\u220f\ni\n\u222b \u221e\n0\n\u222b \u221e\n0\npi(\n\u03c1i\n\u03c1\ns+ y + z)dydz (12)\nfor multiple sequences i, where pi(s) is the spacing proba-\nbility densities of each sequence, while \u03c1i\u03c1 is the associated\nfractional eigenvalue density.\nFor two sequences following the Wigner distribution\n(10), the resulting spacing probability densities is (s\u00af \u2261 1)\nP\u03b2=1(s) =\ne\u22122x\n2\n2\n+\n\u221a\npi\n2\nxe\u2212x\n2E(x), x =\n\u221a\npis\n4\n(13a)\nP\u03b2=2(s) =\n6x2e\u22122x\n2\npi\n+ 2\nx\u2212 x3\u221a\npi\ne\u2212x\n2E(x) + E\n2(x)\n2\n,\nx =\ns\u221a\npi\n(13b)\nP\u03b2=4(s) =\nx\n3\n\u221a\npi\n(6 + 4x2 \u2212 4x4)e\u2212x2E(x) + E\n2(x)\n2\n+\n2x2\n9pi\n(9 + 28x2 + 8x4)e\u22122x\n2\n, x =\n4s\n3\n\u221a\npi\n, (13c)\nwhere E(x) = erfc (x) denotes the complementary error\nfunction.\nC. \u03b2 = 1: Reformulation as a staggered eigenvalue\nsequence\nIn most situations encountered in random-matrix the-\nory, the combinatorial sum over partitions involved in the\nsuperposition of eigenvalue sequences ([as in Eq. (11)]\ncannot be performed explicitly. For the specific case\n\u03b2 = 1, however, the combinatorial sum over I in Eq.\n(11) can be carried out (see below), which then yields a\nclosed-form expression\nP ({Tn}) \u221d\n\u220f\nm>n,\nboth odd\n(Tm \u2212 Tn)\n\u220f\nm>n,\nboth even\n(Tm \u2212 Tn)\n\u220f\nl\n1\u221a\nTl\n.\n(14)\n5(A similar simplification does not present itself in the\ncases \u03b2 = 2 and \u03b2 = 4.) This result finds its nat-\nural statistical interpretation as a staggered superposi-\ntion of two sequences, which is illustrated in Fig. 2(d).\nIn such a superposition, the transmission eigenvalues in\neach sequence are not distinguished by the parity of\nthe associated wavefunction under the symmetry oper-\nation. Instead, the transmission eigenvalues are ordered\nby magnitude (irrespective of parity), and one sequence\nis composed of all odd-indexed transmission eigenvalues\n(of which there are N1) while the other sequence is com-\nposed of all even-indexed transmission eigenvalues (of\nwhich there are N2). Compared to the original super-\nposition of two independent sequences, this differs by the\nadditional constraint\nTI1 \u2264 TI\u00af1 \u2264 TI2 \u2264 TI\u00af2 \u2264 TI3 \u2264 TI\u00af3 . . . (15)\n(which is satisfied when all the ordered indices In are odd\nwhile the indices I\u00afn are all even).\nIn order to demonstrate the equivalence of Eq. (11)\n(for \u03b2 = 1) and Eq. (14) we have to show that the level-\nrepulsion terms are proportional to each other (both ex-\npressions share the same product of one-point weights\u220f\nl T\n\u22121\/2\nl , and the proportionality constant is fixed by\nnormalization). We set out to work towards this goal by\ndefining a matrix\nM =\n( \u2212v1 v2 \u2212v3 v4 \u2212v5 v6 . . . (\u22121)NvN\nw1 w2 w3 w4 w5 w6 . . . wN\n)\n,\n(16)\nwhich is composed of column vectors\nvn = (1, Tn, T 2n , . . . , T\nN1\u22121\nn )\nT , (17)\nwn = (1, Tn, T 2n , . . . , T\nN2\u22121\nn )\nT . (18)\nThe determinant detM can be evaluated in two dif-\nferent ways. In the first way, we expand it in terms of\nsubdeterminants with N1 vectors vn from the first N1\nrows and N2 vectors wm from the remaining rows. In\nother words, we sum over all determinants of the form\ndet\n( \u2212v1 v2 0 v4 0 0 . . .\n0 0 w3 0 w5 w6 . . .\n)\n, (19)\netc., where the indices of the vectors vIn form an or-\ndered subsequence I and the indices of the vectors wI\u00afn\nare given by the complementary subsequence I\u00af. The al-\nternating signs in front of the vectors vIn can be pulled\nout of the determinant at the cost of an overall fac-\ntor (\u22121)I1+I2+...+IN1 . Next, we use permutations of\nneighboring rows to bring all vectors vIn to the left\n(into row n). This results in an additional sign factor\n(\u22121)(I1\u22121)+(I2\u22122)+...+(IN1\u2212N1). The determinant of the\nresulting block matrix factorizes. Overall, this expansion\nyields\ndetM = (\u22121)N1(N1+1)\/2\n\u00d7\n\u2211\nI\u2208P\ndet(vI1 ,vI2 , . . . ,vIN1 ) det(wI\u00af1 ,wI\u00af2 , . . . ,wI\u00afN2 ).\n(20)\nEach subdeterminant is of the form of a Vandermonde\ndeterminant, and therefore\ndetM = (\u22121)N1(N1+1)\/2\n\u00d7\n\u2211\nI\u2208P\n\u220f\nm>n\n(TIm \u2212 TIn)\n\u220f\nm>n\n(\nTI\u00afm \u2212 TI\u00afn\n)\n.\n(21)\nSecondly, the determinant detM can be evaluated by\nadding in Eq. (16) the first N2 rows to the last N2 rows.\nThis yields\ndetM = det\n( \u2212v1 v2 \u2212v3 v4 \u2212v5 v6 . . .\n0 2w2 0 2w4 0 2w6 . . .\n)\n.\n(22)\nProceeding again with the evaluation of subdeterminants\nwe are left with a single choice, namely, to select vectors\nvn with odd index and vectors wn with even index. Ac-\ncounting for all signs and now also factors of two, this\nresults in\ndetM = (\u22121)N1(N1+1)\/2 2N2\n\u00d7det(v1,v3,v5, . . .) det(w2,w4,w6, . . .). (23)\nAs this again involves Vandermonde determinants, we\nfind\ndetM = (\u22121)N1(N1+1)\/2 2N2\n\u00d7\n\u220f\nm>n,\nboth odd\n(Tm \u2212 Tn)\n\u220f\nm>n,\nboth even\n(Tm \u2212 Tn). (24)\nThe two results Eqs. (21) and (24) deliver the remark-\nable identity\u2211\nI\u2208P\n\u220f\nm>n\n(TIm \u2212 TIn)\n\u220f\nm>n\n(\nTI\u00afm \u2212 TI\u00afn\n)\n= 2N2\n\u220f\nm>n,\nboth odd\n(Tm \u2212 Tn)\n\u220f\nm>n,\nboth even\n(Tm \u2212 Tn), (25)\nwhich shows that the level-repulsion term in Eq. (11)\nis indeed proportional to the level-repulsion term in\nEq. (14). As already mentioned, the one-point prod-\nuct\n\u220f\nl T\n\u22121\/2\nl in both expressions is identical, and the\nproportionality constant is fixed by normalization. It\nfollows that for \u03b2 = 1, the independent superposition\nof two transmission-eigenvalue sequences with N1 and\nN2 levels (with N1 and N2 constrained to differ at most\nby one) is identical to a staggered superposition of two\ntransmission-eigenvalue sequences with N1 and N2 levels,\nwhich are correlated by the ordering requirement (15).\nIV. LEAD-TRANSPOSING SYMMETRIES\nSystems with a lead-transposing symmetry require a\nseparate treatment since the symmetry operation only\ncommutes with the Hamiltonian, but not with the cur-\nrent operator (which changes its sign).

(c,d) Eigenphases \u0398n of the matrix Q\non the unit circle, and their projection Eq. (28) which deliv-\ners the transmission eigenvalues.\nof an applied bias, the symmetry operation exchanges\nthe electronic source and drain reservoirs. An obvious\nsymptom of this complication is the fact that the desym-\nmetrized system only possesses a single lead (see Fig.\n3). Mathematically, the transmission matrix does not\nassume a block structure but remains full. We will first\nadapt the concept of desymmetrization to derive the con-\nstraints of the scattering matrix, and then turn to the\njoint probability density of the transmission eigenvalues\nin random-matrix theory. Just as in the previous section,\nwe then focus on the orthogonal symmetry class (\u03b2 = 1)\nand derive a closed expression for the joint probability\ndensity, which again assumes the form of a staggered level\nrepulsion.\nA. Constraints on the scattering matrix\nThe presence of a lead-transposing symmetry immedi-\nately results in the constraint r = r\u2032, t = t\u2032 (when time-\nreversal symmetry is broken by a magnetic field, this can\nbe achieved by an inversion symmetry but not by a re-\nflection symmetry). In order to further exploit the con-\nsequences of the symmetry, let us inspect a time-reversal\nsymmetric system with a reflection symmetry, as shown\nin Fig. 1(e). As shown in Fig. 3(a,b), the desymmetrized\nversions are cut at the symmetry line, where they are\nequipped with Dirichlet or Neumann boundary condi-\ntions for wavefunctions of odd (\u2212) or even parity (+),\nrespectively. Such wave functions are readily constructed\nstarting from the original system when one chooses in-\ncoming amplitudes of the form a(R) = \u00b1a(L). The outgo-\ning amplitudes are then given by b(L) = (r\u00b1t)a(L). Con-\nsequently, the scattering matrices of the desymmetrized\nsystems are given by\nS\u00b1 = r \u00b1 t. (26)\nThe desymmetrized systems only possess a single open-\ning. In order to revert to the scattering matrix of the\noriginal system we invert Eq. (26). The transport in the\noriginal system is therefore described by the transmission\nmatrix t = 12 (S+ \u2212 S\u2212), which gives\ntt\u2020 =\n1\n4\n(2\u2212 S+S\u2020\u2212 \u2212 S\u2212S\u2020+). (27)\nThe properties of this matrix\u2014and especially, of its\neigenvalues Tn\u2014are not separable and depend on the in-\nterplay of both desymmetrized variants.\nB. Conventional random-matrix theory\nRandom-matrix ensembles for systems with lead-\ntransposing symmetry can be obtained by assuming\nthat the scattering matrices S+ and S\u2212 of the desym-\nmetrized variants are statistically independent realiza-\ntions of the appropriate standard circular ensemble. The\nresulting ensembles are identical to those introduced by\nBaranger and Mello [9], who based their considerations\non a maximal-entropy principle.\nEarlier works have addressed isolated aspects of these\nensembles, but not the complete transmission-eigenvalue\nstatistics. For instance, it has been observed that a lead-\ntransposing symmetry increases the conductance fluctu-\nations [8, 11] but eliminates the weak-localization cor-\nrection [11]. For large N , the conductance fluctuations\ndouble, just as is the case for lead-preserving symmetries.\nWe now provide a complete explanation of these observa-\ntions on the basis of the joint probability density of the\ntransmission eigenvalues.\nThe starting point of these considerations is the rela-\ntion\nTn = sin2(\u0398n\/2) =\n1\n2\n(1\u2212 cos\u0398n) (28)\nbetween the transmission eigenvalues Tn and the eigen-\nphases \u0398n of the unitary matrix Q \u2261 S+S\u2020\u2212, which fol-\nlows from Eq. (27). As illustrated in Fig. 3(c,d), the\nstatistics of transmission eigenvalues is hence directly im-\nposed by the statistics of the real parts cos\u0398n of the\nunimodular eigenvalues ei\u0398n of Q.\nIn random-matrix theory, the eigenphases \u0398n follow\nthe statistics of the associated circular ensemble. This\nis evident for the unitary ensemble (\u03b2 = 2), which is in-\nvariant under the multiplication of an arbitrary fixed ma-\ntrix (it hence suffices, e.g., to assume that S+ is random\nwhile S\u2212 is fixed, or vice versa). In the orthogonal case\n(\u03b2 = 1), the unitary transformation Q\u2032 = S\u22121\/2\u2212 QS\n1\/2\n\u2212 =\nS\n\u22121\/2\n\u2212 S+S\n\u22121\/2\n\u2212 results in a symmetric matrix with identi-\ncal eigenvalues. Their circular statistics then follows from\n7the fact that the circular orthogonal ensemble is invariant\nunder the symmetric involution with any fixed symmet-\nric matrix (here, S\u22121\/2\u2212 ). The same transformation also\nsucceeds in the case of self-dual matrices (\u03b2 = 4).\nBecause of the uniform distribution of eigenphases in\nthe circular ensemble [5], the one-point probability den-\nsity P (Tn) is given by Eq. (7) for any finite N (i.e., not\nonly in the limit N \u2192 \u221e) [11]. The joint probability\ndensity of the eigenphases \u0398n is given by [5]\nP\u0398({\u0398n}) \u221d\n\u220f\nm>n\n[\n\u03c3m sin\n\u0398m \u2212\u0398n\n2\n]\u03b2\n. (29)\nHere we ordered the eigenphases by their moduli,\n0 \u2264 |\u03981| \u2264 |\u03982| \u2264 |\u03983| \u2264 . . . \u2264 |\u0398N | \u2264 pi, (30)\nand denoted \u03c3n = sgn\u0398n. Since Eq. (28) does not dis-\ncriminate the sign of \u0398n we proceed to the distribution\nof the moduli \u03b8n = |\u0398n|,\nP\u03b8({\u03b8n}) =\n\u2211\n{\u03c3n}\nP\u0398({\u03c3n\u03b8n}). (31)\nWith the help of the relations\nsin(\u03b8n\/2) =\n\u221a\nTn, cos(\u03b8n\/2) =\n\u221a\n1\u2212 Tn, (32)\nand also accounting for the Jacobian\nd\u03b8n\ndTn\n=\n1\u221a\nTn(1\u2212 Tn)\n, (33)\nthis yields the joint probability density [11]\nP ({Tn}) \u221d\n\u220f\nl\n1\u221a\nTl(1\u2212 Tl)\n\u00d7\n\u2211\n{\u03c3n}\n\u220f\nm>n\n[\u221a\nTn(1\u2212 Tm)\u2212 \u03c3m\u03c3n\n\u221a\nTm(1\u2212 Tn)\n]\u03b2\n.\n(34)\nThis expression is symmetric under the replacement\nTn \u2192 1 \u2212 Tn, which explains the absence of weak-\nlocalization corrections to the conductance. Moreover,\ntransmission eigenvalues do not repel each other when\n\u03c3n = \u2212\u03c3m, i.e., when the underlying eigenphases \u0398n lie\non the opposite (upper and lower) arcs of the unit cir-\ncle [see again Fig. 3(c)]. As the sets of eigenphases on\nboth arcs is only weakly cross-correlated, this explains\nthe doubling of the conductance fluctuations for large N .\nC. Staggered level repulsion for \u03b2 = 1\nWhile the general conclusions of the previous section\ncan be drawn for any \u03b2, it should be noted that Eq.\n(34) still involves a combinatorial sum, and hence is sim-\nilar in status as expression (11) for systems with a lead-\npreserving symmetry. We now show that a much more\ndetailed insight is possible for the orthogonal symmetry\nclass (\u03b2 = 1), where the combinatorial sum in Eq. (34)\ncan be carried out explicitly (see below). The result-\ning statistics again assume the form of a staggered level\nrepulsion, but are not identical to Eq. (14) (which was\nderived from the superposition of two independent level\nsequences): For N an odd integer, we find\nP ({Tn}) \u221d\n\u220f\nm>n, both odd\n(Tm \u2212 Tn)\n\u220f\nl odd\n1\u221a\nTl(1\u2212 Tl)\n\u00d7\n\u220f\nm>n, both even\n(Tm \u2212 Tn), (35a)\nwhile for even N\nP ({Tn}) \u221d\n\u220f\nm>n, both odd\n(Tm \u2212 Tn)\n\u220f\nl odd\n1\u221a\nTl\n\u00d7\n\u220f\nm>n, both even\n(Tm \u2212 Tn)\n\u220f\nl even\n1\u221a\n1\u2212 Tl\n. (35b)\nSimilar to Eq. (14), the joint probability density again\nseparates into two factors, each involving only every sec-\nond eigenvalue. In particular, neighboring levels are not\nprohibited to approach each other closely, and statisti-\ncal fluctuations of observables are enhanced, as has been\nearlier observed for the conductance and the Fano factor\n[8\u201311]. The correlation between the two level sequences\nis again imposed only indirectly by the requirement that\nthe sequences are staggered. This ordering requirement is\nindependent of the parity of the wave function \u2013 indeed,\nin the present case, parity is not well defined as the trans-\nmission eigenvalues arise from the combined properties of\nS+ and S\u2212.\nIn order to derive Eq. (35), let us first inspect Eq. (29).\nBecause of the ordering (30), each factor \u03c3m appearsm\u2212\n1 times, and therefore\nP\u0398({\u0398n}) \u221d\n\u220f\nl even\n\u03c3l\n\u220f\nm>n\nsin\n\u0398m \u2212\u0398n\n2\n. (36)\nWe next pass over to the joint distribution of moduli\n(31). In order to evaluate the combinatorial sum over the\n\u03c3n we express the factor of sine functions in Eq. (36) as\na Vandermonde determinant,\u220f\nm>n\nsin\n\u0398m \u2212\u0398n\n2\n= (\u2212i)N(N\u22121)\/2 detB({\u03c3n\u03b8n}), (37)\nwhere Bml({\u0398n}) = exp(i\u0398ml),m = 1, 2, 3, . . . , N , while\nthe index l runs in integer steps from \u2212(N \u2212 1)\/2 to\n(N \u2212 1)\/2. The multilinearity of the determinant then\nyields\nP\u03b8({\u03b8n}) \u221d (\u2212i\/2)N(N\u22121)\/2 detC, (38)\nwhere Cml = 2 cos(\u03b8ml) for odd m and Cml = 2i sin(\u03b8ml)\nfor even m.\n8For every l > 0 we now add the lth column in C to the\n\u2212lth column, which cancels all sine terms in the latter\ncolumns. The determinant detC = detD detE then fac-\ntorizes, where Dml = cos \u03b8ml, m odd, and Eml = sin \u03b8ml,\nm even. If N is even, the index l is now restricted to\nl = 1\/2, 3\/2, . . . , (N \u2212 1)\/2. For odd N , this index is\nrestricted to l = 0, 1, 2, . . . , (N \u2212 1)\/2 for the matrix D,\nand to l = 1, 2, . . . , (N \u2212 1)\/2 for the matrix E.\nFor odd N we can write Dml as a polynomial of de-\ngree l in cos \u03b8m, and Eml as sin \u03b8m times a polynomial of\ndegree l \u2212 1 in cos \u03b8m. We only need to keep the high-\nest monomial, as the other terms are linear combinations\nof the rows of lower index l. This leaves us again with\nVandermonde determinants,\ndetD \u221d\n\u220f\nm>n, both odd\n(cos \u03b8n \u2212 cos \u03b8m), (39)\ndetE \u221d\n\u220f\nl even\nsin \u03b8l\n\u220f\nm>n, both even\n(cos \u03b8n \u2212 cos \u03b8m). (40)\nFor evenN , the index l is half-integer, and the elements\nof D can now be written as cos(\u03b8m\/2) times a polynomial\nin cos(\u03b8m), while those of E can be written as sin(\u03b8m\/2)\ntimes such a polynomial. This yields\ndetD \u221d\n\u220f\nl odd\ncos(\u03b8l\/2)\n\u220f\nm>n, both odd\n(cos \u03b8n \u2212 cos \u03b8m), (41)\ndetE \u221d\n\u220f\nl even\nsin(\u03b8l\/2)\n\u220f\nm>n, both even\n(cos \u03b8n \u2212 cos \u03b8m). (42)\nThe joint probability density (35) follows by transforming\nfrom \u03b8n to Tn, where the Jacobian is given by Eq. (33),\nwhile the factors in the expressions for D and E can\nbe rewritten with the help of Eq. (32) and the relation\ncos \u03b8n \u2212 cos \u03b8m = 2(Tm \u2212 Tn).\nD. Large-N asymptotics\nIt is natural to ask whether the similarity of Eq. (35)\nto Eq. (14) indicates a possible interpretation as a super-\nposition of two independent level sequences [from which\nEq. (14) was derived]. In Eq. (35), however, this inter-\npretation is prevented by the different one-point weight\nterms associated to the even and odd indexed eigenval-\nues. A symptom of this difference is the fact that Eq.\n(14) implies finite-N weak-localization corrections to the\nconductance, while Eq. (35) delivers the absence of such\ncorrections, in agreement with the general conclusions in\nSec. IVB. Hence, the statistics of systems with a lead-\ntransposing and a lead-preserving symmetry (with \u03b2 = 1)\nonly find a common ground when both are interpreted as\na staggered level sequence.\nFor the case of a lead-preserving symmetry, the frame-\nwork of superpositions of independent level sequences\nof course provides a powerful tool for the derivation of\nlow-point correlation functions and local statistics [such\nas the two-point correlation function, or the level spac-\ning distribution (13)]. We now argue that in the limit\nN \u2192\u221e, this framework can also be adopted for systems\nwith a lead-transposing symmetry.\nIn this limit, the transmission eigenvalues form a quasi-\ncontinuum, and the asymptotical statistics follow from\nthe formal analogy to the statistics of coordinates of\na dense set of parallel line charges in one dimension\n(the Coulomb gas), which exhibit a logarithmic repul-\nsion [1, 5]. In leading order, the weight terms enter the\nanalysis of the statistical fluctuations only via the one-\npoint function P (T ): For fixed index n, the transmis-\nsion eigenvalue Tn are confined to a small neighborhood\naround a nominal equilibrium position T\u00afn, which is given\nby the implicit equation n\u2212 1\/2 = N \u222b T\u00afn\n0\nP (T )dT . Sub-\nsequently, the weight terms can be approximated by a\nconstant (with all the Tn fixed to T\u00afn), while the fluc-\ntuations are exclusively governed by the level-repulsion\nfactors of the joint probability distribution. As the level-\nrepulsion factors are identical in Eqs. (14) and (35) one\nconcludes that the local statistics in both ensembles be-\ncome indistinguishable in the limit of N \u2192\u221e.\nWe therefore obtain the following remarkable result of\npurely statistical origin: For a lead-transposing symme-\ntry, as N is sent to infinity the local statistics (embodied\nin low-point correlation functions) converges to that of a\nsuperposition of two independent level sequences. This\nis the case even though a classification of transmission\neigenvalues by parity is not possible. In particular, we ar-\nrive at the prediction that in this limit, the level-spacing\ndistribution is well approximated by Eq. (13).\nV. NUMERICAL INVESTIGATIONS\nFor the three standard Dyson ensembles of random-\nmatrix theory, the joint probability density (5) manifests\nthe celebrated repulsion between neighboring eigenval-\nues, since the probability to find two closely spaced ad-\njacent eigenvalues is suppressed as (Tn+1\u2212Tn)\u03b2 . In con-\ntrast, the joint densities (14) and (35) (both derived for\n\u03b2 = 1) describe sequences of reduced stiffness, where only\nevery second level is subject to mutual level repulsion. As\nargued before, as long as N takes on moderate values,\nthe latter joint densities imply quantitative differences in\nthe transmission eigenvalue statistics for lead-preserving\nand lead-transposing symmetries, while for large N these\nstatistics should converge onto each other.\nIn this section we illustrate the differences and simi-\nlarities between these scenarios for all three main sym-\nmetry classes (\u03b2 = 1, 2, 4) via numerical sampling of the\nrandom-matrix ensembles, and also compare to realis-\ntic model systems. For convenient characterization of\nthe eigenvalue repulsion we employ the nearest-neighbor\nspacing distribution P (s), as well as spacing distribu-\ntions to more distant neighbors. As we will see, the lo-\ncal statistics of systems with a lead-transposing symme-\ntry actually show a much weaker N dependence than for\n9 0\n 0.2\n 0.4\n 0.6\n 0.8\n 0  1  2  3  4\nP(\ns)\ns\n\u03b2=1\n\u03b2=2\n\u03b2=4\n 0\n 1\n 0  1  2  3\nPoisson\n\u03b2=1\n\u03b2=2\n\u03b2=4\nFIG. 4: (Color online) Probability density P (s) of\ntransmission-eigenvalue spacings for systems with a lead-\ntransposing symmetry, obtained from 104 random matrices\nwith N = 50.

This feature\ncould be anticipated by (but also goes beyond) the ab-\nsence of weak localization corrections in the one-point\nfunction (discussed in Sec. IVB).\nA. Random-matrix theory\nWe start with the characterization of the level statistics\nwithin the various random-matrix ensembles. Let us first\nconsider the case of a lead-transposing symmetry with a\nrelatively large number of transport channels, for which\nwe expect that the local statistics is close to that of a su-\nperposition of two independent level sequences. Starting\npoint of the numerical computations is Eq. (27), where\nthe matrix Q = S+S\n\u2020\n\u2212 is drawn from the appropriate\nDyson ensemble. In order to obtain the nearest-neighbor\nspacing distribution P (s), we unfold the eigenvalue se-\nquences to a mean local spacing s\u00af \u2261 1 [5, 6]. Figure 4\nshows the resulting spacing distributions for N = 50. For\nthis large number of open channels we find that the nu-\nmerical histograms indeed match the predictions from the\nsuperposition of two independent level sequences [solid\ncurves; see Eq. (13)].\nFor comparison, the inset in Fig. 4 shows the stan-\ndard Wigner distributions (10), as well as the Poisson\ndistribution (9). In the Poisson distribution the eigen-\nvalue spacing density is maximal at s = 0; for larger s\nthe probability density decreases monotonically. For the\nWigner distributions the most likely eigenvalue spacing\noccurs at a finite value of s; for s \u2192 0, the distributions\ndecay algebraically\u221d s\u03b2 , while for s\u2192\u221e they decay as a\nGaussian.

In this case, the results for\na lead-transposing symmetry are distinctively different\nfrom those for a lead-preserving symmetry. Interest-\ningly, the nearest-neighbor spacing distribution for a\nlead-transposing symmetry is very similar for small and\nlarge N ; the distribution for N = 4 is already well ap-\nproximated by Eq. (13). In comparison, the nearest-\nneighbor spacing distribution for a lead-preserving sym-\nmetry shows a much stronger N -dependence.\nB. Comparison to model systems\nIn order to validate that realistic quantum systems can\nindeed be described by random matrix theory (on which\nall previous considerations are based), we compare our\npredictions with numerical results for such systems. In\nparticular, we present results of numerical computations\nfor quantum billiards, which model a lateral quantum\ndot, and for the open kicked rotator, which is based on\nan efficient quantum map. We focus on systems in the\northogonal symmetry class (\u03b2 = 1) and contrast sys-\ntems with a lead-transposing symmetry to systems with-\nout any spatial symmetry.\nThe quantum billiards are derived from the stadium\ngeometry, with leads positioned to either break or con-\nserve the reflection symmetry about the vertical center\nline [see Figs. 1(b,e)]. The computations are performed\nusing a modular recursive Green\u2019s function method [12,\n13], with energies that permit 5 \u2264 N \u2264 14 open chan-\nnels in each of the two leads. As shown in Fig. 6(a), the\neigenvalue spacing distribution agrees well with the pre-\ndictions of random-matrix theory, both in presence and\nin absence of a lead-transposing symmetry.\nThe open quantum kicked rotator [14\u201316] is defined by\nthe scattering matrix\nS = P [e\u2212i\u03b5 \u2212 F (1\u2212 PTP )]\u22121FPT , (43)\nwhere \u03b5 is the quasi-energy,\nFnm = (iM)\u22121\/2e\nipi\nM (m\u2212n)2\u2212 iMK4pi (cos 2pinM +cos 2pimM ) (44)\nis theM\u00d7M -dimensional Floquet operator of the kicked\nrotator, and P is an 2N \u00d7M -dimensional matrix which\nprojects the internal Hilbert space onto the openings.\nWe assume that M is even and M \u00c0 N . The reflec-\ntion symmetry of the closed system is manifested in the\nsymmetry Fnm = FM\u2212n,M\u2212m, and the lead-transposing\nsymmetry of the open system is present when in addition\nPnm = P2N\u2212n,M\u2212m.\nFigure 6(b) shows the spacing distributions obtained\nfor kicked rotators with symmetrical and asymmetrical\nlead placement andN = 12. The data represents 6600 re-\nalizations which are generated by varying the quasienergy\n\u03b5 \u2208 [0, 2pi), the kicking strength K \u2208 [10, 15], and the in-\nternal dimension M \u2208 [498, 502]. Again, we find good\nagreement with random-matrix theory, including the re-\nduced eigenvalue repulsion in the lead-symmetric case.\nThe results in this section reveal clear signatures of\nstaggered level repulsion in realistic systems with a lead-\ntransposing symmetry (and \u03b2 = 1). It is worth emphasiz-\ning that the applicability of this statistical concept [em-\nbodied in the random-matrix results Eq. (35)] does not\nrely on any pre- or postprocessing or -selection of the\ntransmission eigenvalues in the model systems (as there\nis no intrinsic property of the transmission eigenvalues\nor their associated scattering wave functions \u2013 such as a\nparity \u2013 that could be used to divide these eigenvalues\ninto two sets).\nVI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\nWe analyzed the transport in open systems with a lead-\ntransposing or a lead-preserving symmetry via the com-\nplete joint probability density of transmission eigenval-\nues, obtained in random-matrix theory.\nFor a lead-preserving symmetry, the standard concept\nof desymmetrization reduces the problem to the inves-\ntigation of independent non-symmetric variants of the\nsystem. For a lead-transposing symmetry, however, the\ntransport characteristics only arise as a collective prop-\nerty of the symmetry-reduced variants of the system. We\nstill found that both types of symmetry result in a similar\nreduction of level repulsion, so that transmission eigen-\nvalues can approach each other closely. For a large num-\nber of transport channels N , the local eigenvalue statis-\ntics for both types of symmetry indeed become indistin-\nguishable.\n11\nOur main analytical results concern a detailed expla-\nnation of these features for systems which also exhibit\ntime-reversal and spin-rotation invariance (the orthogo-\nnal symmetry class, with symmetry index \u03b2 = 1). In\nthis case, the transmission eigenvalue statistics of sys-\ntems with a lead-transposing or lead-preserving symme-\ntry find a common natural interpretation as a staggered\nsuperposition of two independent level sequences. In such\na superposition the eigenvalues alternate between the se-\nquences when they are ordered by magnitude. The joint\nprobability densities for the two types of symmetry only\ndiffer in one-point weight factors. For lead-preserving\nsymmetries these weight factor incorporate 1\/N correc-\ntions for quantities such as the ensemble-averaged con-\nductance, while these corrections are absent for a lead-\ntransposing symmetry. This results in differences of the\nlocal eigenvalue statistics when N is small, but becomes\ninsignificant when N is large.\nWhile we concentrated on systems with discrete spatial\nsymmetries, our results can also be applied for discrete\nsymmetries of different origin (e.g., arising from internal\ndegrees of freedom) that yield equivalent constraints on\nthe scattering matrix.\nAcknowledgments\nWe gratefully acknowledge assistance with the billiard\ncomputations by Florian Aigner, as well as useful dis-\ncussions with Eugene Bogomolny, Piet Brouwer, Vic-\ntor Gopar, Jon Keating, and Martin Zirnbauer.
