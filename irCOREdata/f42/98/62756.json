We test these calculated values against other records in the same region, firstly with other lake \nrecords in Anatolia, the Konya basin and Lake Van, and secondly, with isotope-inferred palaeo-precipitation \ndata from Soreq cave in Israel. This reveals a contrast between pre- and post-LGM precipitation values in \nTurkey (wetter and drier, respectively), and also suggests that during the last glacial-interglacial transition \nthere was a more marked precipitation gradient than at present between northern\/interior and \nsouthern\/coastal parts of the East Mediterranean region.  \n \nKeywords: Oxygen isotope, last glacial maximum, precipitation, Turkey, lakes\n   \n3 \nIntroduction \n \nLate Quaternary lake levels have been shown to vary significantly through time in the circum-Mediterranean \nregion (Robinson et al., 2006; Roberts and Wright, 1993; Harrison and Digerfeldt, 1993). Stein (2001), for \nexample, showed that cold periods in northern latitudes are correlated with high-stands of Lake Lisan, Israel, \nalthough lake level falls are associated with shorter term cold (Heinrich) events, possibly due to the reduction \nin precipitation from a cold Mediterranean Sea (Bartov et al., 2003). There has been debate (e.g. El-\nMoslimany, 1984; Prentice et al. 1992) about the relative contributions of changes in temperature - and \nhence evaporation - versus precipitation and other factors to the last glacial age lake expansion. There is \ncomparable debate for the Early Holocene period, for which evidence from deep-sea cores, speleothems and \nat least some lakes supports a more positive water balance than at the present-day (Ariztegui et al., 2000; \nBar-Matthews et al., 1997; Fontugne et al., 1994), but conflicts with palaeo-botanical data showing a delayed \nrate of postglacial forest re-advance in the eastern Mediterranean (van Zeist and Bottema, 1991; \nWasylikowa, 2005). Reconstructing past climate from lake palaeohydrology requires a good understanding \nof which climatic parameters control lake-level change, primarily the relative contribution of evaporation \nand precipitation. There is need for a more rigorous quantification of palaeolimnological data from the \neastern Mediterranean region in terms of climate, and precipitation in particular. \n \nHere we quantify changes in climate through the last glacial interglacial transition (LGIT) and Holocene \nusing \u03b418O values recorded in a high-resolution lake sedimentary archive from Eski Ac\u0131g\u00f6l, central Turkey, \nby means of coupled hydrological and isotope mass balance modelling. The palaeohydrology of this crater \nlake is relatively simple and we use this lake system to calculate changes in climatic conditions through the \nlast ~20,000 years, before going on to compare these results with those from other climatically calibrated \narchives in the wider East Mediterranean region. \n \nStudy Site  \n \nEski Ac\u0131g\u00f6l (1270 masl; 38\u00ba33\u201901\u2019\u2019N, 34\u00ba32\u201941\u2019\u2019E) is a former crater lake lying within a larger caldera in \nthe Cappadocian region of central Turkey (Figure 1). The caldera, which exposes thick tuffs, volcanic ash, \nobsidian, ignimbrites and basaltic cones, was formed in the mid-Pleistocene (Druitt et al., 1995). The \nformerly brackish lake was drained in 1972. The historic lake had no surface inflows or outflows and the \nsurface catchment was never very much larger than the lake itself. Inputs into the lake would have therefore \nbeen dominated by direct precipitation and ground water inflows and output by evaporation and ground \nwater seepage. A multi-proxy study of change in the lake system over the last ~20 kyr was carried out on \ncores taken from the crater (Roberts et al., 2001). A 16 m core sequence from parallel, overlapping cores \n(ESK96A\/B and ESK97A\/B) recovered non-laminated carbonate-rich lake sediments in the upper 6.5 m \nspanning the second half of the Holocene, underlain by annually-laminated lake deposits that were formed \nunder relatively deepwater conditions, back to the last glacial maximum (LGM) (Figure 2). \n   \n4 \n \nLake isotope mass balance \n \nThe hydrological budget of a lake can be explained by the sum of the inflows and outflows from the system \n(e.g. Gibson et al., 1999; Ricketts and Johnson, 1996), for example: \n \ndV\/dt = P + Si + Gi \u2212 E  \u2212 So  \u2212 Go      (1) \n \nwhere V is lake volume; t, time; P, precipitation on the lake surface; Si, surface inflow from rivers and\/ or \noverland runoff; Gi, ground water inflow; E, evaporation from the lake surface; So, surface outflow; Go, \nground water outflow. (V, P, Si, Gi, E, So and Go are measured in the same units).  \n \nAs well as the water balance equation above (equation 1), the stable isotope values of the lake hydrological \nsystem must also balance such that: \n \ndV\u03b4l\/dt = P\u03b4P + Si\u03b4Si + Gi\u03b4Gi \u2212 E\u03b4E  \u2212So\u03b4So  \u2212 Go\u03b4Go    (2) \n \nwhere the values \u03b4l, \u03b4p, \u03b4Si, \u03b4Gi, \u03b4E, \u03b4So, \u03b4Go are the isotope values (either \u03b418O or \u03b4D) of the lake waters, lake \nsurface precipitation, surface inflow, ground water inflow, lake surface evaporation, surface outflow and \nground water outflow respectively (e.g. Benson and Paillet, 2002; Gibson et al., 1999).  \n \nMethods \n \nAnalytical  methods \n \nStable isotope measurements were determined (relative to PDB) on CO2 liberated from 10 mg bulk sediment \nsamples of calcium carbonate, reacted in phosphoric acid overnight at 25\u00b0C, using a VG Optima mass \nspectrometer with analytical errors of \u00b1 0.1\u2030. The mineralogical content of the samples was identified using \nX-ray diffractometry by infrared spectroscopy on a Perkin-Elmer IR-TF\/16 PC spectrometer at UMR 8501. \nFull details of the methods used can be found in Roberts et al. (2001).  \n \nNumerical methods \n \nFor any given time period it can be assumed that a lake is at hydrological steady-state, such that equation 2 \ncan be written: \n \nP\u03b4P + Si\u03b4Si + Gi\u03b4Gi = E\u03b4E + So\u03b4So + Go\u03b4Go      (3) \n   \n5 \nHere we take five periods (designated as Late Holocene, Early Holocene, Late Glacial Stade, Late Glacial \nInterstade, and Glacial) within the overall Eski Ac\u0131g\u00f6l isotope stratigraphy where recorded \u03b418O values from \ncalcium carbonate (\u03b418Orecorded) are relatively constant (Figure 2, Table 1). The two gaps is the \u03b418O record at \n~7 m and ~8 m are periods of negative isotope excursions (shown in Figure 3 of Roberts et al., 2001) \nassociated with local tephra horizons. These excursions may be due to reactivation of ground waters in the \nsystem during periods of volcanic activity and are therefore not included in discussion of climate change. \nFor each time period we attempt to balance equation 3 and therefore quantitatively understand how climate \nhas changed in central Turkey over the last ~20 kyr. This analysis is intended to quantify mean steady-state \nconditions for different times in the past  and not to test for sub-millennial climate variability or for rates of \nchange across major climate transitions. The Glacial period in this sequence is dated between 16 and ~23 ka, \nand probably does not overlap substantially with the period of highest lake levels immediately prior to the \nLGM in the East Mediterranean region (Bartov et al, 2002; Fontugne et al, 1999; Roberts and Wright, 1993). \nHere the term Late Glacial Stade refers to the period of time (~12.5 ka) where \u03b418Orecorded values return to \nvalues similar to those during Glacial times, following a late glacial interstadial period when \u03b418Orecorded \nvalues were close to those of the early Holocene. These shifts in the lake system occurred at approximately \nthe same time as the Younger Dryas and B\u00f6lling-Aller\u00f6d events in Northern Europe and are likely to be \nconnected to Northern Hemisphere climate shifts at these times. However, due to the U-series dating \nuncertainties for the Eski Ac\u0131g\u00f6l sequence, it is not currently possible to demonstrate climatic synchroneity \nor formal stage equivalence. \n \nValues for the Eski Ac\u0131g\u00f6l calculations \n \nTo understand quantitatively each of the five time periods defined above, as many of the parameters as \npossible in equation 3 must be known. Below each is discussed and values for each time period are \nprescribed.  \n \nTemperature (T): temperature is a key control on many of these parameters and an independent control on \ntemperature is required for input into these calculations. Present-day temperatures in the Cappadocian region \nare coherent between meteorological stations (Figure 3). Average annual temperatures are between +9 and \n+11\u00baC, summer maximum values are around +28 to +30\u00baC and winter minimum temperatures around \u22126 to \n\u22128\u00baC (based on the two years values shown in Figure 3).  It has been proposed elsewhere (Bar-Matthews et \nal., 2003) that temperature changes in the eastern Mediterranean are coherent on land and at sea. Emeis et al. \n(2000) reconstruct sea-surface temperatures (SST) for two sites in the Eastern Mediterranean basin through \nthe time period under investigation based on alkenones (Table 1). For the Ionian Sea the total SST difference \nbetween glacial and interglacial times was 8\u00baC, whereas in the Levantine basin there was an inferred \ntemperature change of 6\u00baC. Hayes et al. (2005) give values for glacial sea-surface temperatures ranging from \n   \n6 \n2 to 6\u00baC cooler than present day in the Eastern Mediterranean based on planktonic foraminifera assemblages. \nAverage annual temperatures at Eski Ac\u0131g\u00f6l for the five time periods are based largely on the magnitude of \nchange from the Levantine basin (Table 1) as it is closer to Eski Ac\u0131g\u00f6l. The changes for the Late Glacial \nStade and Late Glacial Interstade, where there are no data from the Levantine basin, are kept within the \nmaximum range from this study as the changes in Ionian Sea SST are considerably larger. \n \nPrecipitation (P): modern average annual precipitation (p) in Cappadocia is about 0.36 m yr-1 (Figure 3) and \nthis will therefore be taken as the value for the Late Holocene period. Although there is variability through \nall the time periods discussed, within each period the average \u03b418Orecorded value remains relatively constant. A \ndetailed record of the last 2000 years (i.e. the Late Holocene) from a nearby analogous lake, Nar G\u00f6l\u00fc, \nshows that mean \u03b418Orecorded for the last 2000 years are close to the mean values for the last 80 years (Jones et \nal., 2006), suggesting that modern meteorological values and stable isotope hydrological records are \nprobably typical of the late Holocene. Values for the other four time periods are unknown. The amount of \nprecipitation entering the lake is also dependent on lake area.  \n \nLake area (A): the exact lake area for any of the time periods under investigation is unknown. However, \nsimple relationships between lake depth, lake area and lake volume can be developed from the crater \nmorphology (Figure 1). The cores bottomed out in volcanics so a reasonable picture of the basin shape can \nbe established.  During the Glacial through to the Early Holocene the lake sediments were laminated and the \nlake must therefore have been stratified, with anoxic bottom waters. Nearby Nar G\u00f6l\u00fc is 26 m deep at its \ndeepest and waters are anoxic below ~ 10 m. Cores were taken in Nar in the deepest part of the basin and are \nlaminated throughout the last 2000 years (Jones et al., 2006). Cores taken in 15 m water depth are also \nlaminated throughout this time period, suggesting that the chemocline is permanently above 15 m water \ndepth in lakes of this type and size. Therefore, we assume that Eski Ac\u0131g\u00f6l must have been at least 10 m deep \nduring the Glacial to Early Holocene period. The maximum possible water depth for Eski Ac\u0131g\u00f6l would be \n~30 m as the lake basin rim is at 1285 metres above sea level (masl) and the lake would have begun to \noverflow at this point. During the mid-Holocene the lake sediments cease to be laminated indicating that lake \nlevels were significantly reduced. However, lake area may have changed less dramatically as part of this \nreduction in lake depth is due to sediment infilling the crater. From the core stratigraphy (Figure 2) it is \npossible to assess the elevation of the lake bed during each of the time periods under investigation. Diatom \nevidence shows that the Late Glacial water level at Eski Ac\u0131g\u00f6l was not as high as during the Early Holocene \n(Roberts et al. 2001) and Late Holocene lake levels were lower than either of these periods. A range of \npossible lake water depths for each of the time periods can therefore be obtained (Table 2). \n \nIsotopic composition of rainfall (\u03b4P): There is a classic Dansgaard relationship between temperature and \u03b4P \nfor contemporary rain waters on the Anatolian Plateau, with temperature positively correlated with \u03b4P values \nin Ankara (\u03b418OP [SMOW] = 0.31Tmax \u2212 13.2; r2 = 0.64; IAEA\/WMO, 2001). If this relationship holds back \nthrough time, then \u03b4P values would have been more negative during glacial times. For example, a shift of 6\u00baC \n   \n7 \nwould decrease \u03b418OP by 1.8\u2030 compared to today, based on the equation above. However, there would have \nbeen additional changes in \u03b4P as glacial ocean waters, from which rain\/snowfall is derived, would have been \nsubstantially more positive than during interglacial times due to the preferential storage of 16O in the ice \ncaps. Emeis et al. (2000) show that \u03b418O values from planktonic foraminifera were 2.9\u2030 more positive \nduring glacial times in the Ionian Sea and 3.8\u2030 more positive in the Levantine basin. However, because \nthese values are also dependent on temperature changes, the values must be corrected by 0.2\u2030\/\u00b0C (Emeis et \nal., 2000). Corrected values of change between glacial and interglacial times for \u03b418O values of the \nMediterranean Sea waters would therefore be approximately +1.3\u2030 for the Ionian Sea and +2.8\u2030 for the \nLevantine Basin. The combined effect of the temperature and source water effect would therefore be \nbetween \u22120.5 and +1\u2030 for the difference between Late Glacial and Holocene \u03b4P values. \u03b418O values of \nMediterranean Sea water decrease incrementally between the Glacial and Holocene (Emeis et al., 2000) and \nprescribed values for Late Glacial Interstade and Stade \u03b4P therefore change accordingly (Table 4).    \n \nSurface inflow (Si): Due to the small area of the catchment compared to lake area, surface inflow is assumed \nto be 0.  \n \nGround water inflow (Gi): The amount of ground water inflow into the lake is unknown for any of the time \nperiods. \n \nIsotopic composition of ground water inflow (\u03b4Gi):  Ground waters entering the lake are taken to have the \nsame isotope value as mean weighted precipitation because contemporary ground waters in the region have \nbeen shown to be meteoric (Jones et al., 2005; Roberts et al., 2001). \n \nEvaporation (E): Evaporation can be calculated, for example, using equation 4 (Linacre, 1992): \n \nE = [0.015 + 4 x 10-4 Ta + 10-6z] x [480 (Ta + 0.006z)\/ (84 \u2212 Lat) \u2013 40 + 2.3 u (Ta \u2212 Td)]  (4)  \n \nwhere E = Evaporation (mm day-1), Ta = average air temperature (\u00b0C), z = altitude (m), Lat = latitude, u = \nwind speed (m s-1) and Td = dew point temperature = 0.52 Tmin + 0.60 Tmax \u2212 0.009 (Tmax)2 \u2212 2 \u00b0C, Tmin = \nminimum temperature, Tmax = maximum temperature. Minimum and maximum temperatures are assumed to \nshift by the same magnitude as Ta (Table 1). Late Holocene values are Ta = 10, Tmin = 5, Tmax = 15.5 (Figure \n3). \n \nEquation 4 has been used to calculate evaporation for the five time periods investigated here, since this \nequation has been shown to produce values close to contemporary measured evaporation across Turkey \n(Jones et al., 2005). Based on colder temperatures, evaporation would have been much lower during glacial \ntimes; however, there is no way of calculating wind speeds. Contemporary wind speeds on the Anatolian \nPlateau average about 3 m s-1 during the year (Meteoroloji B\u00fclteni, 1974; field observations). If wind speeds \n   \n8 \nwere higher during glacial times, which has been suggested (e.g. Wyputta and Grieger, 1999), evaporation \nwould increase. However, sensitivity analysis of evaporation with changing wind speed (Figure 4a) shows \nthat average glacial wind speeds would have to be greater than 26.5 m s-1 for evaporation to be higher during \nthe late glacial compared to the late Holocene. For the Holocene and Late Glacial Interstadial periods wind \nspeeds are taken to be 3 m s-1, and wind speeds are arbitrarily taken to be twice as strong (6 m s-1) during the \nLate Glacial and Late Glacial Stadial periods. With these values of wind speed and the given values of \ntemperature Late Holocene evaporation is taken to be 1.08 m yr-1 which is within the range of recorded \nevaporation across Turkey (Meteoroloji B\u00fclteni, 1974), compared to values of 0.40 m yr-1 during the Glacial. \n \nIsotopic composition of Evaporation (\u03b4E): An equation for calculating \u03b4E was obtained from observations \nat Pyramid Lake, Nevada (Benson and White, 1994), and has been used by other authors for modelling other \nsites (e.g. Ricketts and Johnson, 1996). It states that: \n \nRevap = [(Rlake\/\u03b1eq) \u2212 (RHfadRat)]\/ [((1\u2212RH)\/\u03b1kin) +RH(1\u2212fad)]    (5) \n \nwhere \u03b4i = (Ri \u2212 1)103, Rat is the isotope ratio of the free atmospheric water vapour, fad is the fraction of \natmospheric water vapour in the boundary layer over the lake (if all the atmospheric water overlying the lake \nis derived from evaporation, then fad = 0), RH is the relative humidity, and \u03b1eq (1\/\u03b1*) and \u03b1kin are \nfractionation factors.  \n \nFractionation factors (\u03b1eq and \u03b1kin): the equilibrium fractionation factor, \u03b1eq, can be calculated \n \n  \u03b1eq = exp(1137 T-2 \u2212 0.4156 T-1 \u2212 2.0667 x 10-3) = 1\/\u03b1*     (6) \n \nwhere T is the temperature of the lake surface water in degrees Kelvin. The kinetic fractionation factor, \u03b1kin, \nis dependent on wind speed and for wind speeds less than 6.8 m s-1, \u03b1kin = 0.994 (Majoube, 1971). \n \nFraction of atmospheric water vapour (fad): Benson and White (1994) suggest that fad should always be \ntaken as 0 as the water vapour immediately overlying the liquid surface will be the dominant control on \u03b4E \nand will be almost entirely made up of evaporated water. This assumption will be used here.   \n \nIsotope value of atmospheric water vapour (\u03b418Oat): because fad is assumed to be 0 the value of \u03b418Oat does \nnot influence \u03b4E and is therefore not required. \n \nRelative humidity (RH): relative humidity has a strong relationship with temperature and rainfall in \ncontemporary Cappadocia (Jones et al., 2005) with increasing RH associated with decreased temperatures, as \nthe volume of air holding a given mass of water decreases, and increased rainfall. However, over glacial-\ninterglacial time scales it has been suggested that increases in temperature have been associated with \n   \n9 \nincreases in relative humidity as more moisture becomes available and more is evaporated (Lemke and \nSturm, 1997). Previous work in Eastern Turkey (Lemcke and Sturm, 1997) suggests that glacial relative \nhumidity was around 35 to 40% during the last glaciation rising to around 60% in the Early Holocene. In this \nstudy Holocene values for RH are taken as 68%, based on annual average values for Cappadocia (Figure 3). \nGlacial values are taken to be 40% based on the work of Lemcke and Sturm (1997). Instrumental records \nshow that RH values in Van and Cappadocia are similar at the present day (Meteoroloji B\u00fclteni, 1974). \n \nSurface outflow (So): Surface outflow from the lake would occur only if the lake level rose by more than \n~30 m, at which point it would overflow. \n \nGround water outflow (Go): Ground water output from the lake is unknown. \n \nIsotopic value of ground water (\u03b4Go): Ground water leaving the lake is taken to be isotopically the same as \nlake water values (\u03b4l). \n \nIsotopic value of lake water (\u03b4l): Figure 2 shows the \u03b418Orecorded data from the Eski Ac\u0131g\u00f6l core sequence. \nBefore these values can be used in the calculations they must be corrected for fractionation differences due to \nthe different types of calcium carbonate precipitated and converted to values of \u03b4l. Taking the mineralogy \ndata from Figure 2, Early Holocene carbonates are predominantly calcite and therefore \u03b418Orecorded can remain \nunchanged. Glacial isotope values are recorded from sediments comprised largely of aragonite and a \ncorrection factor of \u22120.6\u2030 (Tarutani et al., 1965) must therefore be applied. In addition some of the Late \nHolocene sediments comprise authigenic dolomite which is ~ 3\u2030 more positive relative to calcite \nprecipitated under the same conditions (Land, 1980). Some of these Late Holocene sediments also contain \naragonite. The Late Holocene values can be corrected to calcite if the amount of the three different \ncarbonates is known as: \n \n \u03b418Orecorded =  fcalcite\u03b418\u039fcalcite + faragonite(\u03b418\u039fcalcite+ 0.6) + fdolomite(\u03b418\u039fcalcite+ 3)  (7) \n \nwhere fcalcite, faragonite, fdolomite, are the fraction of each mineral phase in the sediment. However, it is unlikely \nthat all the dolomite is reacted during the isotope analysis procedure used here and that the real calcite-\nequivalent value of the analysed sediments is therefore somewhere between the recorded value and that \ncalculated from equation 7. (For the sensitivity of the Late Holocene calculations to these different values see \nbelow). Initially a correction of \u22120.6\u2030 will be used to account for some of the difference due to dolomite \nand the part of the Late Holocene curve where aragonite is present. \n \nCarbonates are generally precipitated in the summer months (Saarnisto, 1986; Jones et al., 2005) and \nsummer temperature is therefore used to calculate the \u03b4l values from which the carbonates were precipitated. \nNar G\u00f6l\u00fc, a contemporary analogue for Eski Ac\u0131g\u00f6l, has lake water temperatures that lie between the \n   \n10 \nmonthly average and maximum values, and therefore an average of these values are used to calculate the \nlake water temperatures from which the carbonates are precipitated, using the equation of Kim and O'Neil \n(1997) modified by Leng and Marshall (2004) (equation 8). It has been suggested (Leng and Marshall, 2004) \nthat this equation be used for all calculations although temperatures calculated from it are lower than those \nusing some other palaeotemperature equations (e.g. Anderson and Arthur, 1983) and the validity of the Kim \nand O\u2019Neil equation has been questioned (Zhou and Zheng, 2003).  \n \n T = 13.8 \u2013 4.58 (\u03b4c \u2212 \u03b4w) + 0.08 (\u03b4c \u2212 \u03b4w)2     (8) \n \nwhere T is the lake water temperature (\u00baC), \u03b4c is the calcite equivalent \u03b418O  value relative to VPDB and \u03b4w \nis the unknown isotope value of the lake water relative to VSMOW. Changes in summer temperatures are \nbased on the magnitude of change for average temperatures in Table 1. Late Holocene values for Eski Ac\u0131g\u00f6l \nare 17\u00baC for average summer temperature and 24.5\u00baC for maximum summer temperatures (Figure 3). Based \non these values lake water isotope values can be calculated for the time periods under investigation (Table \n3). \n \nModel sensitivity \n \nSensitivity tests look at the possible variability and errors that may have occurred in the original calculations. \nFor this a range of lake depths are used (Table 2). Three other input variables can be easily changed, values \nfor relative humidity, wind speed and temperature have been prescribed for all times periods except the Late \nHolocene. By changing these values it is possible to observe if the initial values, and relative states, are \nrobust or sensitive to changes in these parameters. \n \nThe effect of changing values of wind speed (Figure 4a) have been discussed above and make very little \ndifference to the ranges of values calculated relative to changes in temperature. Temperature values were \nchanged by \u00b1 1\u00b0C for each of the time periods to see how sensitive the equations are to changes in \ntemperature and to allow for errors in the temperature estimates. Relative humidity controls changes in \u03b4E, \nand it is taken into account in calculations of E in the form of Td which is estimated from Tmin and Tmax. \nFigure 4b shows the sensitivity of \u03b4E to changing RH at different values of \u03b4l. Given the large differences in \n\u03b4l prescribed by \u03b418Orecorded, \u03b4E is not sensitive enough to changing RH to have a large impact on the model \noutput. \n \nResults \n \nBased on the values above, equation 3 can be balanced for the five time periods of interest; Late Holocene, \nEarly Holocene, Late Glacial Stade, Late Glacial Interstade, Glacial (Table 4). Unknowns in equation 3 can \nbe investigated by simultaneously solving isotope mass balance equations (i.e. equation 3) with a steady-\n   \n11 \nstate water mass balance version of equation 1. This results in all values being known for the Late Holocene, \nas there are only two unknowns, Gi and Go. For the four other time periods there are three unknowns. \nHowever, equation 3 can be expressed: \n \n \u03b4P(P+ Gi) = E\u03b4E + Go\u03b4l        (9) \n \nwhere if (P+Gi) = Qi, the total influx into the lake, there are again only two unknowns (Qi and Go), which \ncan therefore be calculated.  \n \nAs discussed above the exact calcite-equivalent isotope value for the Late Holocene is unknown due to the \npresence of dolomite in the sediment. The actual value will lie somewhere between the value used and the \nvalue calculated using equation 6; that is, between +1 and +2\u2030. As the calculations from equation 3 show \nthat ground water outflow from the lake must be 0 at this time the lake hydrological budget is simply Qi = E \nwhere P and E are both known. Gi can therefore be easily calculated. It therefore makes no difference to the \ncalculation which value of \u03b4l is used, as neither \u03b4l nor \u03b4E are used in the calculation. \n \nFrom the five solutions to equation 9 it can be shown that there is larger water input into the lake during the \nEarly Holocene and the Late Glacial Interstade than at any other times during the record (5.2-7.2 and 4.2-6.4 \nx 105 m3 respectively, table 4), with the Glacial being the time of least water input into the lake system (<2.7 \nx 105 m3).  \n \nCalculating precipitation \n \nThere are clear differences between the values for total water influx (Qi) between the five time periods \n(Table 4). Investigating the controls on this value can lead to an understanding of how precipitation may \nhave varied in the past. The amount of precipitation (p) will be important in controlling Qi, as well as \nparameters controlling the fraction of water falling in the lake catchment which reaches the lake as \ngroundwater inflow. However, apart from p there are only a few factors that could significantly change the \namount of water reaching the lake through ground water in this small catchment. Pollen evidence from the \nregion shows that arboreal vegetation re-established itself relatively slowly in central and eastern Turkey \nduring the Holocene (Wick et al., 2003; Woldring and Bottema, 2003), so it is unlikely that Early Holocene \nand glacial-age woody vegetation made a major difference to evapotranspiration rates. Although it was \nsignificantly colder in Turkey during glacial times, and the lake is likely to have frozen in winter, it is \nunlikely that there was significant freezing of the ground water system throughout the year. The main \ncontrolling factor on the volume of water entering the lake must therefore have been p. \n \nFrom these calculations it is possible to conclude that precipitation was lower in central Turkey at, and after, \nthe LGM compared to the Early Holocene, and that the latter period was wetter than the present day. \n   \n12 \nAdditionally, it is possible to refine further the data and investigate how these changes in water balance may \nreflect changes in climate conditions. \n \nThe value of p is known for the Late Holocene; however, modelled values of Qi vary with different \nprescribed lake areas and temperatures. To calculate precipitation in the past a relationship for p as a function \nof Qi needs to be established. From the late Holocene model solved for a range of temperature and lake area \nconditions: \n \n  p = Qi \/ 3.4A         (10) \n \nEquation 10 gives a value of 0.32 \u00b1 0.04 m yr-1 for Late Holocene precipitation, consistent with \ninstrumentally recorded p in the region (Figure 3). From equation 10 and the calculations of Qi precipitation \nduring the Early Holocene was 0.39 \u00b1 0.06 m yr-1 and precipitation values were 0.24 \u00b1 0.06 m yr-1 during the \nLate Glacial Stade, 0.45 \u00b1 0.05 m yr-1 during the Late Glacial Interstade and 0.20 \u00b1 0.07 m yr-1 during the \nGlacial (Figure 5). \n \nControls on regional lake isotope values \n \nThese calculations also allow investigation of the controls on \u03b4l values in the East Mediterranean region. The \nEski Ac\u0131g\u00f6l record was initially interpreted to reflect a change in the precipitation: evaporation (P:E) ratio \n(Roberts et al., 2001). Using values from these five time periods it can be shown that the interpretation \ncannot be this simple. Although for the two Holocene periods more negative \u03b418Orecorded values are associated \nwith a higher P:E ratio, the highest P:E ratio occurred during the Glacial which has intermediate \u03b418Orecorded \nvalues. Other possible controls on the lake system can be investigated by comparing the calcite equivalent \ncarbonate isotope value (\u03b418Ocalcite = \u03b418Orecorded corrected for changes in mineralogy) with other parameters \n(Table 5). From this it can be shown that the strongest correlation is between \u03b418Ocalcite and lake depth \n(r2=0.63) or water volume (r2=0.65). Go also has a strong correlation with \u03b418Orecorded (r2=0.57). This suggests \nthat it is the volumetric flux of water passing through the lake that controls \u03b4l rather than P:E per se, and that \nthe amount of ground water outflow relative to E may also be significant.  \n \nRegional comparisons \n \nFurther evidence of Late Quaternary hydrological variability on the Anatolian plateau comes from studies of \npast lake levels on the Konya plain ~150 km to the southwest of Cappadocia (Figure 1). Palaeo-lake Konya \ncontrasts sharply with the Eski Ac\u0131g\u00f6l crater lake in having been large and shallow relative to its surface \narea, and dominated by runoff and direct precipitation. Lake-level reconstructions show that a mega-lake \nexisted at and prior to the LGM (Roberts, 1983) and also show that the Late Glacial Interstade was probably \nthe only time when substantial permanent standing water bodies existed on the Konya plain after ~20 ka. \n   \n13 \nDuring the post-LGM Glacial, Late Glacial Stade and Holocene the Konya basin was generally dry with the \nestablishment and re-activation of aeolian dune systems (Kuzucuo\u011flu et al., 1998; Fontugne et al., 1999). \nThese data are consistent with the sequence of precipitation changes inferred from the Eski Ac\u0131g\u00f6l isotope \nrecord. As the last major lake high-stand in the Konya basin occurred at and prior to ~21 ka (Roberts, 1983), \nprecipitation must therefore have been higher at that time than between 21-16 ka, unless temperatures, and \ntherefore evaporation rates, were also significantly lower. There were, therefore, cold and wet periods (> 21 \nka), as well and cold and dry periods (21 \u2013 16 ka) in the Eastern Mediterranean during the last glaciation. \nGiven that the calculations from Eski Ac\u0131g\u00f6l show warm and dry as well as warm and wet Holocene \nconditions, there can be no simple relationship between changes in temperature and moisture in the region \nover glacial-interglacial timescales. \n  \nThe lake-level record from Lake Van in eastern Anatolia (Figure 1) also shows impressive variations through \nthe time frame under investigation here, with evident similarities to the sequences from Eski Ac\u0131g\u00f6l and \nKonya. Landmann et al. (1996) showed that, as in Konya, the pre-LGM (< 21ka) was a period of lake high-\nstand. The maximum high-stands in the lakes of the Jordan rift valley similarly preceded the LGM (Hazan et \nal., 2005; Bartov et al., 2002) with lake levels apparently falling before the main LGIT temperature \namelioration (c. 14 ka). In Van, there was a drop in lake level of >200 m during the post-LGM Glacial when \nmuch of the lake bed was dry. As at Konya and Eski Ac\u0131g\u00f6l, lake levels rose here during the Late Glacial \nInterstade, before falling again during the Late Glacial Stade. Maximum postglacial lake levels were reached \nduring the first half of the Holocene, although later than the apparent precipitation maximum in the lake sites \nof west-central Anatolia.  \n \nFurther south, Bar-Matthews et al. (1997; 2003) have reconstructed precipitation variability over the same \ntime period covered by the Eski Ac\u0131g\u00f6l record from Soreq Cave in Israel. The stable isotope data from the \nSoreq speleothems provides an obvious point of comparison with the climatically calibrated lake isotope \nrecord from central Anatolia. For comparison between the two data sets, we have calculated the values of \npalaeo-precipitation at Soreq using the same amplitude temperature changes prescribed in the Eski Ac\u0131g\u00f6l \ntime frames, and for similar time periods where \u03b418Orecorded values from the Soreq Cave are generally \nconstant, assuming that major isotope changes were broadly synchronous between the two sites.  Late \nHolocene average \u03b418Orecorded values at Soreq are \u22125.3\u2030, compared to \u22126.1\u2030 for the Early Holocene, \u22124.3\u2030 \nfor the Late Glacial Stade, \u22125.8\u2030 for the Late Glacial Interstade and \u22123.1\u2030 for the Glacial (McGarry et al., \n2004). The isotope values of cave waters, which are 1\u2030 enriched in 18O compared to rainfall (Bar-Matthews \net al., 2003), appear to be controlled by the amount of precipitation with more positive isotope values \nassociated with reduced rainfall. Past values of cave waters are calculated from the values of speleothem \ncarbonate and the same amplitude temperature shifts used for the Eski Ac\u0131g\u00f6l calculations, using equation 7.   \n \nAs shown in Figure 5, the long-term trends of precipitation in both central Turkey and northern Israel are \nremarkably similar. Being located in what is today a wetter climatic region, reconstructed precipitation \n   \n14 \nvalues at Soreq Cave are, not surprisingly, consistently higher than those at Eski Ac\u0131g\u00f6l. Additionally, these \nresults suggest that the effect of the Late Glacial Stade was felt more strongly in the interior location of Eski \nAc\u0131g\u00f6l than at Soreq Cave, near to the Mediterranean coast, with either a greater reduction in precipitation or \ntemperature changes of different amplitude at the two sites during this time period, or both.  \n \nDuring the Late Glacial Stade, Lake Van showed a shift in \u03b418Orecorded values even larger (~5\u2030) than that at \nEski Ac\u0131g\u00f6l (2.5\u2030) (Wick et al., 2003). As Van is a much larger lake than Eski Ac\u0131g\u00f6l, and with more \nevaporated lake waters, the same climatic forcing would be expected to produce a smaller isotopic response \nat Van (Leng and Marshall, 2004). The larger shift in \u03b418Orecorded at Van therefore suggests that the Late \nGlacial Stade was more pronounced here than in central Anatolia, which in turn was more marked than in the \nsouthern Levant.  This implies that a steeper moisture gradient may have existed between coastal and interior \nparts of the East Mediterranean during Late Glacial Stadial times than at the present day. \n \nConclusions \n \nA \u03b418Orecorded record from Eski Ac\u0131g\u00f6l crater lake confirms that the post-LGM Glacial period was \ncharacterised by lower precipitation as well as having lower temperatures than today, and that the Early \nHolocene was wetter than at present. Through isotope and hydrological mass balance modelling we have \nbeen able to quantify this change in terms of specific climate variables for the first time in Turkey. Post-\nLGM Glacial precipitation in central Turkey was ~ 60% lower than the present day value, but ~ 20% higher \nduring the Early Holocene. These long-term trends are similar to those recorded at Soreq Cave in central \nIsrael, suggesting a coherency in climate across this region. Palaeo-precipitation values are dependent on \nprescribed temperature values and may therefore change with improved future understanding, particularly of \nspatial variability in terrestrial temperature trends across the Eastern Mediterranean. Importantly, we have \nshown that there were periods of cold-dry climate and cold-moist climate within the last glacial, as well as \nperiods of warm-wet and warm-dry climate during the Holocene.   \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThis work was carried out whilst MDJ was funded by the Leverhulme Trust (F\/00568\/1).
