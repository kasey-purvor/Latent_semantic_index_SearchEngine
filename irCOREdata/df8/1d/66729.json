First we compute\nan approximation of the diffraction pattern that will produce the desired light-intensity distribution on the\nsubstrate to be patterned. This pattern is then digitized and converted into a format suitable for manufac-\nture by a direct-write method.

The technique has many potential applications in\nthe packaging of microelectronics and microelectromechanical systems. \u00a9 2005 Optical Society of America\nOCIS codes: 090.1760, 110.5220, 110.3960.\nPhotolithography is generally performed on a nomi-\nnally flat substrate, such as a silicon wafer or a\nprinted circuit board. The growth of microelectrome-\nchanical systems and the search for higher-density\nelectronics packaging solutions has led, however, to\nthe requirement to pattern fine features onto nonpla-\nnar substrates. These substrates cannot be placed in\nclose proximity to the (planar) masks. As a result, dif-\nfraction occurs between the mask and the substrate,\ncausing distortions to the shapes of the required\nfeatures.\nA number of resolution enhancement techniques\nexist that can be used to compensate for such distor-\ntions, but these have been developed primarily for\nuse with planar substrates.1 These techniques were\nrecently used to enhance the patterning of nonplanar\nsubstrates, for example, to facilitate the photolitho-\ngraphic patterning of 100-\u0002m-pitch features over\n500-\u0002m-high steps.2 An extension of this approach\nleads to the concept of holographic photolithography,\na technique that was developed by Holtronic SA. The\nHoltronic approach is to generate a total-internal-\nreflection holographic mask from a real master,\nwhich permits the high-yield patterning of submi-\ncrometer features onto large flat-panel displays.3 In\nthis Letter we present a method for making masks\ncomposed of computer-generated holographic (CGH)\npatterns, which replace the master holograms.4 We\nthen examine the use of the CGH masks to pattern\ngrossly nonplanar substrates.\nThe diffraction pattern in the CGH plane \u0002X ,Y\u0003\nthat results from a line in space characterized as\nshown in Fig. 1 is given in Ref. 5 as\nH\u0002X,Y\u0003 = exp\u0004j \u0003\n\u0004zx\ny2\u0005 , \u00021\u0003\nwhere \u0004 is the wavelength of the light source and zx\n=z0\u2212x tan\u0002\u0005\u0003, where \u0005 is the angle between the line\nsegment and the plane of the CGH. Translation of the\nline segment in the x and y directions can be accom-\nplished by the introduction of a linear phase factor,\nwhile the orientation of the line with respect to the\nCGH axes \u0002X ,Y\u0003 is accounted for by a coordinate\ntransform:\nx = X cos\u0002\u0006\u0003 \u2212 Y sin\u0002\u0006\u0003, y = X sin\u0002\u0006\u0003 + Y cos\u0002\u0006\u0003.\n\u00022\u0003\nOne can control the length of a line segment by trun-\ncating Eq. (1) in the x direction, in which case the re-\nsultant distribution in the image plane when \u0005=0 is\ngiven by\n\u0006U\u0002u,v\u0003\u0006 = \u0006f\u0002u\u0003\u0006a\u0007\u0004z sinc\u0002av\/\u0004z\u0003, \u00023\u0003\nwhere f\u0002u\u0003 is the complex Fresnel integral, z is the\nseparation of the mask and the image plane, and a is\nthe extent of the CGH in the y direction. It can be\nshown experimentally that this result also applies\napproximately to lines when \u0005 \u0007 80\u00b0.\nThe intensity of the line segment therefore varies\nas sinc2 in the v direction, and in the u direction it\nmay be approximated by a rect function:\nFig. 1. Line geometry.\n1300 OPTICS LETTERS \/ Vol. 30, No. 11 \/ June 1, 2005\n0146-9592\/05\/111300-3\/$15.00 \u00a9 2005 Optical Society of America\nf\u0002u\u0003 \b \t1 \u0006u\u0006\u0007 b\/20 \u0006u\u0006\b b\/2\n , \u00024\u0003\nwhere b is the extent of the line-segment representa-\ntion in the x direction of the CGH. Superposition of\nseveral diffraction patterns defined in this way can\nbe used to produce a CGH that forms an image com-\nposed of line segments. However, use of a CGH of this\ntype as a lithographic mask is limited by the ex-\ntremely high resolution required for imaging a fine\nline segment at a small distance from the mask, be-\ncause the high-frequency fringes that are present at\nthe extremities of the line-segment representation\nmust be sampled without aliasing. We propose a\nmodified version of Eq. (1) in which the diffraction\npattern generated by each line segment is limited in\nboth the x and the y directions to a finite area of the\nmask. The offset of a reconstructed line segment is\nachieved by an appropriate translation of this local-\nized diffraction pattern:\nH\u0002X,Y\u0003 = exp\u000bj \u0003\n\u0004zx\n\u0002y \u2212 y0\u00032\frect\u0004x \u2212 x0b , y \u2212 y0a\u0002 \u0005 ,\n\u00025\u0003\nwhere a\u0002 is the localized limit of the line-segment\nrepresentation in the y direction of the CGH and x0\nand y0 are the offsets of the line from the optical axis\nin the x and y directions, respectively. This distribu-\ntion reduces resolution requirements in the CGH.\nFor the CGH to be written by use of a conventional\nplotting device it is necessary for a sampled version\nof the distribution in Eq. (5) to be converted to a bi-\nnary format; this can be achieved in a number of\nways.6,7 For the example described in this Letter, a\nsimple thresholding method was used in which the\nreal part of Eq. (5) was sampled on a pixel grid and\nthose pixels with a positive value were set to 1 (trans-\nparent) whereas all others were set to 0 (opaque).\nOne can find the image that results from a line-\nsegment CGH of this type by expressing the binary\npattern as a Fourier series and summing the images\nformed by each of the Fourier components. In this\nway, a good approximation to the resultant line-\nsegment amplitude in the v direction after insignifi-\ncant terms are dropped and with small phase varia-\ntions neglected is\n\u0006U\u0002v\u0003\u0006 \r\na\u0002\n\u0003\nsinc\u0004a\u0002v\n\u0004z\n\u0005 + \u0007\u0004z\n2\nrect\u0004 v\na\u0002\n\u0005\n+\n\u0007\u0004z\n\u0003\nrect\u0004 v\n2a\u0002\n\u0005 . \u00026\u0003\nA three-segment line CGH produced with this ap-\nproximation is shown in Fig. 2; Fig. 3 shows the ap-\nproximate and measured intensity distributions pro-\nduced at the focal distance of a line segment. The\ndistribution can be seen to consist of the required\nsinc2 profile, combined with a broad spread of back-\nground noise. Constructing the CGH as a binary\nphase mask would eliminate the second term in rela-\ntion (6) and improve the signal-to-noise ratio.\nIn a conventional CGH, the multiple images that\nresult from sampling must be spatially separated if\nthe primary image is not to be distorted, leading to\nthe requirement for a minimum mask\u2013substrate\nseparation for a given mask resolution. However, in\nthe case of a CGH composed of line-segment diffrac-\ntion patterns as in Eq. (5) and represented by a bi-\nnary amplitude distribution, these aliasing con-\nstraints can be relaxed because there are no multiple\nimages formed by the line segments in either the u\ndirection, in which the CGH representation is simply\na series of long rectangular apertures, or the v direc-\ntion, where the image plane amplitude distribution is\nas outlined above. Parallel line segments can there-\nfore be imaged at a relatively fine pitch, provided\nthat the background noise components that are\npresent in relation (6) are taken into account. If the\nextent of each line-diffraction pattern in the y direc-\ntion is taken as being the largest possible for the\ngiven pixel spacing, such that aliasing does not occur,\nthen it can be shown that the full width at half-\nheight of the sinc2 line profile becomes approximately\nequal to the pixel spacing in the mask, regardless of\nmask\u2013substrate separation z.\nFor grossly nonplanar surfaces, application of a\nuniform layer of photoresist can be problematic.\nSpray nozzles have been developed that allow modest\ntopographies to be covered uniformly, but for complex\nsubstrate shapes the preferred method is to use an\nelectrodepositable photoresist8; in our experiments\nwe used a positive-acting electrodepositable photore-\nsist (PEPR 2400). With careful control of the photo-\nresist\u2019s composition9 a bias voltage of 175 V at room\nFig. 2. Thresholded CGH representation of a stepped line\nsegment.\nFig. 3.

A custom-built alignment\ntool was used to expose the photoresist-coated sub-\nstrate through the CGH mask. The light source was\nthe beam-expanded spot from a Coherent I304 Ar-ion\nlaser, producing 100 mW of TEM00 power at 355 nm.\nUsing the approach detailed above, we wrote a\n40-\u0002m-resolution CGH mask (Fig. 2) consisting of\nthree line segments that recreates a line tracing a\npath over a 4-cm step at 10 cm from the mask. A sty-\nlus depth profiler was used to record a depth profile\nacross the imaged line segment, and further data\nwere captured from a CCD camera. These results are\ncompared with the approximation in relation (6) in\nFig. 3. Accurate control of exposure and developing\nconditions has enabled us to image a reasonably con-\nsistent 100-\u0002m-wide line along the length of the sub-\nstrate (Fig. 4).\nIn conclusion, we have shown that computer-\ngenerated holographic masks consisting of thresh-\nolded line segments can be used to pattern lines onto\na grossly nonplanar substrate. We have also shown\nthat the linewidth can be controlled over these sur-\nfaces and that the minimum feature size is approxi-\nmately equal to the resolution of the computer-\ngenerated mask, regardless of substrate\u2013mask\nseparation.\nRepresentations of the CGH other than the simple\nbinary format used here are currently being investi-\ngated, together with modified versions of the distri-\nbution in Eq. (5) that will permit better control of the\nwidth and length of line segments. Masks consisting\nof several parallel line segments are being tested to\ndetermine the resolution limits imposed on these pat-\nterns by the background noise, and the effect on the\nexposed photoresist of intersecting lines is also being\nconsidered.\nThis research has been funded by the Engineering\nand Physical Sciences Research Council through the\nElectronic and Photonic Packaging and Interconnect\nFaraday Partnership and a Higher Education Fund-\ning Council equipment grant.
