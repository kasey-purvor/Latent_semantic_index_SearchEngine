INTRODUCTION\nOVER THE last three decades, the broadband helixtraveling-wave tube (TWT) has gained ascendancy in\nradar, electronic countermeasures, and other warfare sys-\ntems [1]. Increases in output power and bandwidth of the device\nare essential to meet the ever-increasing demands for these\napplications.\nHigh dispersion of the slow-wave structure (SWS) is one of\nthe limiting factors in achieving high efficiency over a multi-\noctave band [2]\u2013[4]. Other criticalities involve low interaction\nimpedance and high RF loss at the higher end of the operating\nfrequency band [5]\u2013[8]. Considerable efforts have been made in\nthe past to overcome these limitations. A major area of research\nwas to investigate the effects of different shapes of metal vanes\nand dielectric support rods in controlling the dispersion [9]\u2013[11].\nIn other attempts, the optimization of vane radius to achieve a\npotentially dispersion-free characteristic while maintaining the\ninteraction impedance at the higher end of the frequency band\nwas carried out [12], [13]. Studies on semivane structure and\ndielectric constant of the material used for the support rods have\nshown their effectiveness in shaping the phase velocity to obtain\na nearly flat dispersion [14], [15]. However, it is the phase lag of\nthe RF current wave with respect to the circuit wave toward the\nend of the SWS that restricts the amount of energy being trans-\nManuscript received August 14, 2007; revised October 25, 2007.

The loss of synchronism\nbetween the wave and the beam limits the output power, and\nhence, the efficiency of the TWTs. In a narrow-band TWT, a\nhelix pitch profile, which incorporates a section with a positive\nphase velocity followed by a negative phase velocity taper, can\nbe used at the output section of the SWS to resynchronize the\nwave with the beam, and thereby, achieve high efficiency [16].\nAn alternative pitch profile, a positively tapered helix, which was\nfirst conceived in the 1960s, can also be used for this purpose\n[17]. In a recent work, a theoretical study on its usefulness in im-\nproving the wideband performance was carried out [18]. The ex-\nperimental performance of a multioctave band positively tapered\nhelix mini-TWT was first demonstrated by Ghosh et al. [19].\nIn this paper, the design strategy of such devices is elaborated\nupon and supported by further experimental results. An exten-\nsive literature survey is also included in the introduction.\nII. LARGE-SIGNAL MODEL VALIDATION\nTo design and accurately predict the performance of a pos-\nitively tapered TWT, it is useful to have a validated model of\na baseline TWT such as the one with uniform pitch. For this\npurpose, an existing two-section 4.5\u201318 GHz helix mini-TWT,\ndesignated TWT1, with uniform pitch was used as the starting\npoint of the design. The tube was fitted with a two-stage collec-\ntor and subminiature A (SMA) connectors on both the input and\noutput ports. The operating voltage and beam current of TWT1\nare 4.5 kV and 200 mA, respectively.\nA large-signal interaction code [21] was initially used to vali-\ndate the model of TWT1 and later used to design positive tapers.\nTo generate a set of values for Pierce impedance and propagation\nconstant at different frequencies of the operating band, which\nwere taken as input to the code, a model of the SWS similar\nto Fig. 1 was simulated using the 3-D electromagnetic field\n0018-9383\/$25.00 \u00a9 2008 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

Comparison between simulated and experimental output of TWT1.\nsimulator Microwave Studio.1 This model consists of a single-\nturn helix with finite tape thickness, dielectric support rods,\nT-shaped metallic vanes, and body tube. The dielectric constant\nof the materials were defined to ensure accurate computation of\nthe impedance and phase velocity of the wave. Periodic bound-\nary conditions were applied at both ends of the structure along\nthe axial direction of the helix. Once the steady state was reached\nin the eigenmode solver, the values of Pierce impedance and\npropagation constant at different frequencies were calculated\nusing the postprocessor, as shown in Fig. 2. As expected, the\nPierce impedance decreases and propagation constant increases\nwith the increase in frequency. Other than these two parameters,\nthe dimensions of the SWS, basic electrical parameters (beam\nvoltage, beam current, and beam radius), return loss, and cold\nloss (attenuator, sever, and helix) were used as input to perform\nthe large-signal analysis of TWT1. To achieve the beam pa-\nrameters, the electron gun and the periodic permanent magnet\n(PPM) focusing system were modeled assuming uniform cur-\nrent density in the beam and validated against the experimental\nresults. The good agreement between the simulated and the ex-\nperimental values of saturated output power and saturated gain\nin Fig. 3 validates the large-signal model. The slight mismatch\nin the output power may be attributed to the approximation of\n1Supplied by Computer Simulation Technologies (CST).\nFig. 4. Different pitch profiles.\nFig. 5.

An-\nother parameter that may have contributed to the mismatch is a\nslightly higher helix cold loss [7].\nIII. POSITIVE TAPER DESIGN\nTo optimize the performance, a number of TWTs were de-\nsigned and developed to have different taper dimensions [20],\nthree of which are discussed here. In a positively tapered helix,\nthe pitch remains constant over a length and gradually increases\ntoward the end, as shown in Fig. 4. The length of the taper is a\nsmall fraction of the total length of the helix between the input\nand output ports, and is determined from the Applegate diagram,\nas shown in Fig. 5. The validated model of TWT1 in the large-\nsignal interaction code was used to generate the relative phase of\nthe electrons against the normalized axial length of the helix at\n18 GHz. It was intended to use the calculations at 18 GHz as\nthe basis for the design, because the output power in TWT1\ndecreases at the higher end of the operating frequency band (see\nFig. 3). It is evident from the plot in Fig. 5 that the electron\nbunches start to disperse and the main group of electrons drifts\nupward near saturation. In any bunch, the trajectories with posi-\ntive slope indicate that the electrons are fast moving in an upward\ndirection and tend to reach the accelerating phase.

Effect of final pitch variation on the electronic efficiency of the TWT\nwith positive taper 2.\nFig. 7. Applegate diagram of the TWT with positive taper 2 and final taper\npitch 1.098 (normalized) at 18 GHz.\nelectrons with negative slope reach the decelerating phase at sat-\nuration (normalized axial length 1.0) and transfer their energy\nto the RF wave. Clearly, the intention is for the majority of the\ntrajectories to move downward so that they give up their energy\nto the wave. Based on the location of the bunch, two different\nstarting positions along the axis were chosen as taper 1 and\ntaper 2. Both tapers have the same initial and final pitch but\ndifferent lengths. In both the cases, the initial pitch was kept\nthe same as that of TWT1 and the final pitch was optimized\nthrough a number of iterations to achieve maximum efficiency.\nTo show the effect of final pitch variation, the values of simu-\nlated electronic efficiency versus frequency are plotted in Fig. 6\nfor a number of different pitch values. For all computations, the\ntaper length is the same as positive taper 2, and pitch values\nare normalized with respect to the uniform pitch. None of the\npitch values in the plot result in the highest electronic efficiency\nat both ends of the operating band. As a compromise, the bold\nline in the plot for normalized pitch value of 1.098 was cho-\nsen as optimized. The computed efficiency of this optimized\npositive pitch taper shows significant improvement over TWT1\nthroughout the band. To examine the nature of electron trajec-\ntories in the optimized configuration, an Applegate diagram at\n18 GHz is shown in Fig. 7. A comparison between Figs. 5 and\n7 reveals that the bunch center is tending to move upward to-\nward saturation in the former case, whereas in the latter case,\nFig. 8. Comparison of saturated fundamental output power.\nFig. 9. Comparison of saturated gain.\nit tends to move downward. The positive taper increases the\nphase velocity of the wave to resynchronize it with the velocity\nof those electrons, which are tending to be accelerated. This\nmakes it possible to transfer more energy from the beam to the\nRF wave. Comparisons at other frequencies result in similar\nobservations [20].\nIV. EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION\nBased on the positive taper designs, three different tubes,\nTWT2, TWT3, and TWT4, were developed in sequential order.\nAfter every iteration, the experimental results were analyzed\nand necessary design modifications were incorporated in the\nnext iteration for further improvements in the performance. This\nstrategy resulted in the need for fewer design iterations, facilitat-\ning lower cost and reduced time for development. Experimental\nresults of saturated fundamental output power, saturated gain,\nand second harmonic content for all the four TWTs are plotted\nin Figs. 8, 9, and 10, respectively.\nThe salient points of these plots along with the configurations\nof the TWTs are discussed later.\nA. Comparison Between TWT1 and TWT2\nAll components of TWT2 were the same as TWT1 other\nthan the helix, which had a pitch profile similar to taper 1.

Restrictions apply. \nGHOSH et al.: Improvements in Performance of Broadband Helix TWTs 671\nFig. 10. Comparison of second harmonic power.\ncomparison between these two tubes shows that the saturated\noutput power of TWT2 improves significantly in the frequency\nrange 6\u201318 GHz with very little or no change at the lower end of\nthe operating band. The maximum and minimum improvements\nin this band are 42 W (1.3 dB) at 8 GHz and 11 W (0.35 dB)\nat 10 GHz, respectively. However, the saturated gain of the tube\ndecreases up to 5 dB in the frequency range 8\u201318 GHz and\nremains unchanged at the lower end of the band. The second\nharmonic content of the device is lower at frequencies higher\nthan 5 GHz, and it is lowest of all the four TWTs at frequencies\nhigher than 6.5 GHz.\nB. Comparison Between TWT2 and TWT3\nTo increase the output power over the entire operating band,\nespecially at the lower end of the band, the helix pitch profile\nin TWT3 was changed to taper 2. To compensate for the loss\nof gain as observed in TWT2, the length of the attenuator was\nreduced. The new active length was calculated from the gain\nper unit length, where the gain includes the small-signal gain,\nand total loss. The rest of the components were kept the same as\nTWT2. A comparison between the two tubes shows a significant\nimprovement in the output power throughout the band other\nthan 7\u201310 GHz in TWT3. The saturated gain is also increased\nthroughout the band. However, the second harmonic content\nbecomes higher at the frequency range 6.5\u20139 GHz, though it is\nlower at the lower end of the operating band.\nC. Comparison Between TWT3 and TWT4\nTWT4 was developed with all components similar to TWT3\nother than the electron gun, which was replaced with a new gun\nof larger cathode diameter. This reduces the cathode emission\ncurrent density by nearly 45%, and hence, increases the TWT\noperating life. The first three magnets of the periodic permanent\nmagnet focusing structure were changed for profiling the mag-\nnetic field near the gun region to achieve optimized beam launch-\ning conditions. In comparison with TWT3, TWT4 shows slight\nimprovement in the output power and second harmonic content\nover the entire band, while the saturated gain remains the same.\nThe improvements are attributed to better beam laminarity, and\nhence, better beam-wave interaction.

Comparison of overall efficiency.\nTABLE I\nCOMPARISON BETWEEN EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS OF TWT1 AND TWT4\ntion currents measured with RF are 13 and 10 mA for TWT3\nand TWT4, respectively. In the case of dc operation, the beam\ntransmission is better than 99% in both tubes. The consistency\nbetween the performance of TWT3 and TWT4 demonstrates the\nrepeatability of the TWT manufacturing process.\nThe effectiveness of the positive phase velocity tapering in\nimproving the electronic efficiency is demonstrated in Fig. 11.\nIt is evident from the plot that all three positively tapered TWTs\nshow significant improvement in performance over the TWT\nwith uniform pitch. The overall efficiencies for all positively ta-\npered TWTs were also improved by approximately 5% points,\nas shown in Fig. 12. To summarize the experimental results,\na comparison between the best performing tube, TWT4, and\nTWT1 is made in Table I, which is self-explanatory. Improve-\nments up to 50 W (1.7 dB) in output power and 5.2% points in\nelectronic efficiency have been achieved.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

CONCLUSION\nTo improve broadband performance, a number of TWTs were\ndesigned and developed with helices of different taper lengths.\nThe performance of three of these TWTs, which had shown sig-\nnificant improvements in output power and electronic efficiency\nover the entire operating band, was discussed. These three TWTs\nemployed two different pitch taper lengths. Improvement in\noutput power up to 1.7 dB and electronic efficiency up to 5.2%\npoints were achieved. A close correlation between the exper-\nimental results of TWT3 and TWT4 proves that repeatability\nwas maintained during the development. Future work will in-\nclude the design and development of an optimized three-stage\ncollector to improve the overall efficiency.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank Dr. W. L.
