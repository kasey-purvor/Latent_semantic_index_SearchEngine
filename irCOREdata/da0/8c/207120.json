Today, the elevation of\nethnic and cultural hybridity as both an approximate return to primordial hu-\nman unity and an emancipatory moral high ground renders socio-cultural dif-\nference at once the presumed telos of many social practices and a scandal to be\novercome. Whereas the older anthropological cosmology uncovered by Sahlins\nposited progress from atomistic privation to social solidarity, this new cosmol-\nogy posits the politically motivated splintering of essential human unity by the\nconstruction of ethnicity and culture. Although I iterate the caution that this\nemergent paradigm too has the potential to reproduce itself as ethnography, I\nemphasize as more important its promising and troubling potential to revalorize\nanthropological thinking on cosmology. Specifically, ownership of the meta-\ncosmology encoded in hybridity theory ought to prompt anthropologists to\nquestion our recently acquired aversion to the idea that cosmologies inform hu-\nman action. At the same time, however, we need to scrutinize our fascination\nwith hybridity for signs of an unintentionally Nietzschean glorification of dis-\nsolution or aestheticization of periodic destruction as the necessary foundation\nfor political and moral renovation.1\nUnlike the older anthropological cosmology analyzed by Sahlins, the current\none to which I refer has been developed by academics from diverse and mixed\nintellectual and cultural backgrounds, some of whom point out that all anthro-\npologists embody what I take to be the key metaphor of this cosmology: hy-\nbridity (Moore 1997:131\u201334).2 Many of the themes and arguments in which I\ndiscern this latent cosmology are by now familiar. They are legible in the dis-\ncourses on modernity and globalization, postmodernity, colonialism, postcolo-\nniality, the social construction of space, and the critique of the culture concept.\nDrawing on the work of some of the most widely cited authors on these subjects,\nI argue that these discourses promote the metaphor of hybridity as representa-\ntive of a universal default condition of chaos, understood in the limited sense of\na re-integrative confusion of categories. Over against this particular model of\nchaos, diverse forms of socio-cultural practice are found to be incomplete and\nimpermanent efforts toward differentiation, classification, and hierarchization.3\nThe narratives and values embedded in these discourses furthermore paral-\nlel those found in two structurally analogous but morally inverse mythic mod-\nhybridity, vacuity, and blockage 191\n1 Although contributors to the cosmology I am describing regularly indict Romanticism as the\nsource of the morally suspect culture concept, the cosmology they implicitly construct entails new\nversions, not only of the Romantic (or at least Rousseauean) theme of a naturally free and happy\nhumanity constrained and corrupted by civilization, but also of the theme of an antinomian, even\nviolent, impulse toward dissolution into elemental forces (on these themes see Berlin 1999).\n2 Accordingly, unlike Sahlins, I do not attempt to identify a particular religious or philosophi-\ncal tradition behind the new cosmology. To do so would, in fact, be an essentializing endeavor.\nMoreover, as indicated in notes 4 and 5, below, variations on the basic cosmological paradigm in\nquestion are too widely attested for this trend in theory to be attributable to one tradition more\nthan another.\n3 I am identifying a general trend and do not intend to imply that every contribution to these dis-\ncourses displays this tendency.\nels of cosmogony. Critics of regimes of difference often follow a logic compa-\nrable to that of emanationist cosmogonies: they value chaos, figured as an orig-\ninal undivided whole, positively, but value order, seen as dependent on frag-\nmentation, negatively.4 Accordingly, these critiques tend to privilege processes\nof hybridization that erode socio-cultural differences and approximate a return\nto underlying human unity. But they also regularly present these same re-blend-\ning processes as conducive to new forms of segmentation. At the same time,\nanalysts that read regimes of difference as attempts to classify, rationalize, and\ncontrol describe a logic comparable to that of dismemberment cosmogonies:\nthe social agents analyzed are found to value the categories they construct pos-\nitively as the means to order, but value the lack or breakdown of such rational-\nizations negatively as chaotic confusion to be kept at bay by constant category\nmaintenance.5 Accordingly, such analyses often represent the practices under\nstudy as schemes of repartition and recalibration necessitated by the intolera-\nble inroads of hybridization. Clearly, these are two sides of the same coin. The\nrelative moral values assigned to chaos and order may invert according to the\npoint of view of the analyst or the outlook imputed to the agents analyzed, but\nthe structure is constant: there is an ongoing oscillation between differentiation\nand integration.\nAfter excavating this cyclical paradigm from recent anthropological theo-\nrizing, I compare two ethnographic examples in order to demonstrate why it is\nimportant to bring this paradigm to the surface and identify it as a cosmologi-\ncal one. The first example stems from my own field research on conflicting ma-\ntrilineal identities and land claims among the Arosi of Makira, Solomon Islands.\nThe second, dependent on the work of Arjun Appadurai and Christopher Tay-\nlor, pertains to the late twentieth-century ethnic violence in Burundi and Rwan-\nda. Through these examples, I explore the relationship between cosmology at\nthe meta-level of theory and cosmologies \u201cin flux\u201d (Appadurai 1998:231) in\nethnographic situations.\nAppadurai (1996:180) suggests that to characterize particular practices as\ncosmological is to \u201ccreate the dubious impression of mechanical reproduction.\u201d\nDespite such hostility to cosmology, present-day social scientific discourses are\nnot innocent of similar deterministic tendencies, originating at the level of the-\nory as meta-cosmology.6 Bearing the latent claim that human beings every-\n192 michael w. scott\n4 Myths of emanation depict the universe as coming into being through processes of sponta-\nneous differentiation within an original unity that contains all things in potentia. Examples of this\nmodel are widespread and include the Hawaiian Kumulipo (Valeri 1985:215), some Hindu myths\nof ultimate origins (Smith 1989:54\u201369), and a variety of pre-Socratic, neo-Platonic, and Gnostic\nphilosophies.\n5 Myths of cosmogonic dismemberment depict the universe as coming into being through the\nviolent death and division of a primordial sacrifice, the body of which provides the materials from\nwhich the cosmos is constructed. Examples include the Babylonian Enuma Elish and the Vedic\nmyth of Purus\n\u00b7\na (Lincoln 1986; Valeri 1995).\n6 Although some anthropologists continue to find cosmology a useful concept (e.g., Feuchtwang\nwhere make order out of chaos by first creating and then reaffirming differ-\nences, contemporary anthropological theory is no less\u2014and no more\u2014mech-\nanistic a template through which to view human agency than any other cosmo-\nlogical system. Although some would see this as a delegitimating flaw in\ncurrent theory, I argue instead that, as structures that inform human agency, the\nuniversal impetus to order identified in anthropological meta-cosmology and\nthe visions of chaos and order production embedded in particular cosmologies\nshould be analyzed together in the hermeneutics of practice. As my ethno-\ngraphic examples show, however, such a methodology reveals the need to\ndestabilize hybridity, or any preconceived image, as the regnant model of what\nconstitutes chaos. Whereas the meta-cosmology of theory posits that all people\nseek to impose ordering distinctions on chaos\u2014understood exclusively as in-\nsufficient differentiation\u2014attention to the cosmologies in flux in lived situa-\ntions indicates that not all people conceptualize chaos in terms of the absence\nor admixture of categories. This means broadening our received notions of what\nchaos might mean to accommodate any possible vision of what preceded or is\nantithetical to proper order. Once this general and open-ended definition of\nchaos is granted, comparative study shows that visions of chaos other than con-\nfusion entail methods of order production other than the marking of difference.\nThus, for Arosi, chaos\u2014the condition inimical to order\u2014takes the form of so-\ncially and morally evacuated space that provokes conflicting reordering acts of\nmatrilineal emplacement. In Burundi and Rwanda, however, it appears that a\ncondition opposite to order can take the form of \u201cblocked beings\u201d that must be\npurged from the body politic. What is required analytically, then, is a nexus be-\ntween the universal impulse to order and the particular understandings of chaos\nthat can inform the practical manifestations of that impulse. I conclude, there-\nfore, with a proposal for developing a pluralized notion of chaos as a potentially\nproductive comparative category for anthropological theorizing and ethno-\ngraphic analysis.\nchaos as hybridity and the production of difference \nin anthropological cosmology\nA defining feature of the cosmology implicit in much of current anthropologi-\ncal theory is a tendency to highlight and even celebrate hybridity in ways that\nhybridity, vacuity, and blockage 193\n2004; Gow 2001; Herzfeld 1992; Kapferer 1997), ethnographic analyses of praxis that appeal to\ncosmology increasingly risk critique as cultural determinism. This stigmatization of cosmology is\ntraceable, in part, to criticisms of Sahlins\u2019 interpretations of colonial history in Hawaii, but is also\nbound up with the larger critique of the culture concept (e.g., Kuper 1999). Regarded as culture or\nstructure by another name, cosmology can be cast as an intellectualist, objectivist, mechanistic con-\nstruct that over-systematizes local knowledge and robs people of agency. Thus, Taylor, writing a\nchapter entitled \u201cThe Cosmology of Terror\u201d in which he argues that \u201csomething cultural happened\u201d\nin Rwanda, devotes four pages to preemptive deflection of such criticisms (1999:99\u2013102; cf.\nKapferer 1997:19), and the Comaroffs (1991:152) distance themselves from the term with invert-\ned commas.\nrender this condition comparable to a return to the generative state of chaos, en-\nvisioned as the plenitude of primordial unity (cf. Friedman 2002:131). This fea-\nture is most apparent in discussions of how multiple processes and phenome-\nna, such as greater and accelerated mobility, transnational communities and\ncommerce, and the technologies of mass communication, combine to erode\nspatial, political, and social boundaries while expanding imagined possibilities\nfor identity production and relationships. The globalizing era is one in which\nthe formerly naturalized limits of nations, cultures, and ethnicities have become\nblurred under forms and spaces of hybridity, flux, liminality, and uncertainty.\nThis is to say that we live increasingly in a state of chaos, understood as the re-\ncombination of the constituent elements of order within a new creative vortex\n(cf. Brightman 1995:517, 540; Friedman 1999:2\u20133).7\nConcretizing this hybridity, anthropologists are privileging interstitial zones\nof migration, displacement, and deterritorialization\u2014such as roads, border-\nlands, and contested spaces\u2014not only as revelatory sites for ethnographic in-\nquiry, but as emblematic of the liminality of the globalizing, postmodern, or\npostcolonial condition (Ballinger 2004:31; Gupta and Ferguson 1997:48; cf.\nAggarwal 2001; Clifford 1997; Hern\u00e1ndez 2001; Masquelier 2002; Thomas\n2002). As the matrix of new formations, the chaotic hybridity that these tropes\nspatialize is deeply ambivalent, however. For many thinkers (Abu-Lughod\n1991; Bhabha 1989; Gupta and Ferguson 1997:47\u201350; Young 1995:22\u201325), the\nfigurative borderland where dichotomies between Self and Other disintegrate\nprovides the standpoint for prophetic critique of old orders and the subversion\nof inequalities; whereas, for Appadurai (1998), uncertain boundaries between\nethnic identities become the likely sites of \u201cvivisectionist violence\u201d as a means\nof identity and order reconfiguration.\nAlthough some theorists suggest that the present contingency, permeability,\nand overlap of spaces and subjectivities constitutes something new, many tend\nalso to normalize chaotic confusion as a more or less permanent feature of hu-\nman history. The present hybridity is thus \u201cbusiness as usual, only more so\u201d\n(Moore 1997:141): an acute intensification of the hybridity that has always re-\nsulted from \u201cthe historical processes of a socially and spatially interconnected\nworld\u201d (Gupta and Ferguson 1997:45). Once recognized as constant, these\nprocesses reveal the \u201cassumed isomorphism of space, place, and culture\u201d to\nhave been a \u201cfiction\u201d (Gupta and Ferguson 1997:34). Cultures, furthermore,\n194 michael w. scott\n7 I am not claiming that anthropologists have explicitly defined hybridity as chaos; neverthe-\nless, I find support for my analysis that current anthropological theory entails a cyclical cosmolo-\ngy according to which the postcolonial or globalizing era constitutes the return of a chaos-like con-\ndition, often described as hybridity, in statements such as the following: \u201cthe chaos of the garage\nsale . . . provides a precise image for the postcolonial situation where cultural artifacts flow be-\ntween unlikely places, and nothing is sacred, permanent, or sealed off\u201d (Rosaldo 1989:44); \u201cDe-\nspite decolonization, certain destinies and identities seem fixed, while others seem chaotic, disor-\nderly, unfixed\u201d (Dirks 1992:23); \u201cour current theories of cultural chaos are insufficiently\ndeveloped\u201d (Appadurai 1996:47).\nhave never been discrete, homogenous, wholes; rather, the processes of socio-\nspatial differentiation and the material and symbolic representations they pro-\nduce are inherently aspirational, complex, and dynamic (see Brightman 1995).\nIt is easily overlooked, however, that to generalize relative degrees of chaot-\nic hybridity to all times and contexts is to posit a processual model of cultural\nformation, erosion, and reformation. Even as incipient cultural configurations\nemerge at multiple and shifting sites, they are ruptured by flows of intercon-\nnection that, in turn, stimulate transformative redefinitions. This processual\nmodel, I submit, entails a cosmological paradigm according to which an origi-\nnal state of chaos, understood as unbroken human unity, gives rise to projects\nof order production, understood as projects of socio-cultural differentiation.\nThe central conundrum that an anthropology informed by this cosmology\nseeks to explain is how the ontologically unitary category Homo sapiens seg-\nments itself into \u201ca difference-producing set of relations\u201d (Gupta and Ferguson\n1997:46).\nFormulated as a reaction against a supposed anthropological \u201cpremise of\ndiscontinuity\u201d that views ethnographic others as \u201cpreexisting ontological en-\ntit[ies]\u201d (Gupta and Ferguson 1997:33, 44), this cosmology reaffirms universal\nhumanity as the necessary moral and intellectual starting point for anthropo-\nlogical inquiry.8 Less obvious, however, are the ways in which the processual\nmodel described above can position this clearly non-negotiable premise with-\nin unacknowledged value-laden mythic scenarios. With respect to the critique\nof the culture concept, Sahlins (2000:162) identifies what he terms a \u201cpseudo-\nhistory of the original-sin variety\u201d according to which \u201cculture\u201d was, in Dirks\u2019\nwords, \u201cinvented\u201d as a tool of Western colonial discrimination and domination\n(1992:3). Similarly, I suggest, the processual model evident in anthropological\ncosmology today evokes a vision of the development of socio-cultural varia-\ntion as a kind of fall from unity and equality of the Tower of Babel or emana-\ntionist variety. The necessary subtext to the pseudohistory of the colonial in-\nvention of \u201cculture\u201d seems, in fact, to be an implicit myth of the primordial\ninvention of difference in an analogous primeval power struggle. This sub-\ntext surfaces when Dirks concedes that colonialism itself \u201ccan be seen as a cul-\ntural formation\u201d emerging from and reinforcing the \u201cprocesses that spawned\nnations in the first place\u201d (1992:3). Such a back-step from colonial to earlier\nEuropean history is the first in an infinite regress to a primordial paradox: re-\nlations of power and difference generate and presuppose one another. They\nmust be imagined as having come into being simultaneously when mythic an-\ncestors first forged and wielded prototypes of the \u201ccultural technologies\u201d of\ncolonialism (Dirks 1992:3) to sacrifice human unity. But note how these myth-\nic \u201cculture heroes\u201d have become culture culprits, high priests of power who pre-\nhybridity, vacuity, and blockage 195\n8 For the disputable claim that anthropology has operated with a model of human races and cul-\ntures as essentially distinct species, see, for example, Abu-Lughod 1991; Kuper 1999; Thomas\n1994: ch. 3; Young 1995: ch. 2.\nside over the dismemberment and hierarchical distribution of humanity. The\nmoral implications of this latent just-so-story are uncompromising: only the ar-\nchitects of order, who almost always have blood on their hands, can ever find\nit good.\nThis is a truly pessimistic view, not only of culture, but of difference at all.\nDifference at almost every level is an illusion to be denaturalized as the super-\nficial yet scarring artifact of power relations. Difference is an offense to be de-\nnied as ultimately unreal; but, as in emanationist views of the phenomenal\nworld, there is hope that the sufferings and injustices it brings may be mitigat-\ned through enlightened awareness of its unreality. It is this hope that animates\nat least some of the turn to hybridity in anthropological theory. More than a\nmetaphor for the globalizing, postmodern, or postcolonial condition, hybridity\nis embraced as the historical approximation of, and means of moral reconnec-\ntion with, an ideal of human unity that lifts us \u201cbeyond \u2018culture\u2019\u201d (Gupta and\nFerguson 1997:48) and unmasks all differences as constructed, negotiable, and\ntransient (but see Friedman 2003:25).\nKey theorists of hybridity have, nevertheless, resisted the potential world-\nrejecting or Gnostic implications of their negativity and sought a realist orien-\ntation to the inequalities and structures of domination in which difference is im-\nplicated. Avoiding the temptation to \u201csublate\u201d hybridity \u201cinto some utopian\nsense of liberation or return\u201d (Bhabha 1989:67, in Gupta and Ferguson 1997:48;\ncf. Bhabha 1994:38\u201339), and cautioning that postcolonial hybridity is not a\ntrope that \u201cresolves or provides solutions\u201d to the rhythms of coalescence and\nre-division (Moore 1997:142), these theorists challenge anthropology to en-\ngage with a world in which difference will always be with us. They take the role\nof subversive trickster who speaks from the margins to question all projects that\nrely on and reify difference, especially the master dichotomy between Self and\nOther. Given the impossibility of permanent liberation from regimes of differ-\nence, hybridity reveals and promotes the mutability of all categories.\nThe flip-side to this normalization and ethical privileging of hybridity is the\nacknowledgment that the fluidity of hybridity, however morally appealing, is\nnot practically sustainable. To the extent that hybridization is also homoge-\nnization, it may induce reactionary re-differentiation in the forms of \u201cregional-\nization, nationalism, retribalism, and reinforced or newly constructed ethnici-\nty\u201d (Lewellen 2002:77). With the recognition of this dynamic, the formulation\nof a universal human condition emerges: we cannot not differentiate. We can-\nnot eradicate our proclivity to make order out of chaos by constructing cate-\ngories and prescribing relations among them. Surprisingly, in fact, despite its\ndevelopment within the critical response to structuralism, the new anthropo-\nlogical cosmology promotes a view of human ontology that is consonant with\na central assertion of L\u00e9vi-Strauss. We make meaning by making order and or-\nder by cognizing and associating categories, and it is because of this propensi-\nty to make order via opposition that, however many socio-cultural worlds col-\n196 michael w. scott\nlapse, new ones\u2014aspirational, incomplete, multiplex, and competing\u2014will be\nconstructed from selected old and new elements.\nIn sum, the cyclical cosmology written into current theory assumes that hu-\nman agency is driven by a universal inclination to achieve order by precipitat-\ning categories out of a resurgent chaotic confusion for which hybridity has be-\ncome a typifying metaphor. The interpretation of actual histories and practices\nin light of this meta-cosmology involves, therefore, a degree of cosmological\ndeterminism: \u201chistory everywhere is actively made in a dialectic of order and\ndisorder, consensus and contest\u201d (Comaroff and Comaroff 1991:18). But this\ndoes not mean that history is ever, as Eliade (1954) claimed, abolished. Rather,\nit suggests that we are constantly negotiating a cosmological transition from\nchaos to order, and that\u2014precisely because history interrupts and impedes our\nprogress\u2014we continually modify the terms of this negotiation. As the follow-\ning ethnographic examples demonstrate, for anthropology, this means that the-\noretical acceptance of a universal impetus to order ought to redirect attention\nto how this impetus is manifested under the particular forms of lived cosmolo-\ngies. Such a renewed approach to the anthropology of cosmology argues that\npersons are not prisoners of cosmological mandates; rather, cosmologies make\nimages and models available to persons engaged in the common human project\nof making order out of chaos. Furthermore, such redirected attention to the ac-\ntual ways in which people make order out of chaos soon discovers that this com-\nmon human project is carried out with reference to multiple understandings of\nwhat constitutes a condition contrary to order and what ordering activities most\neffectively banish those particular visions of chaos.\nchaos as vacuity and matrilineal place-making in arosi\nA recent colonial and postcolonial history of broadening and proliferating in-\nterconnections has intensified the normal chaotic hybridity of the Melanesian\ncontext known as Arosi on the island of Makira.9 The island first entered Eu-\nropean awareness in 1568 with the arrival of the Spanish explorer \u00c1lvaro de\nMenda\u00f1a, who named it San Cristoval. Following whalers and traders, Angli-\ncan missionaries arrived in the mid nineteenth century, regularly taking island\nyouths back to their school in New Zealand. Labor recruitment to Queensland\nand Fiji between 1870 and 1911 also placed Arosi people in new Pacific set-\ntings from which they brought back a variety of foreign goods and new \u201ccon-\ntext-generative\u201d (Appadurai 1996:182\u201388) ideas about their relationship to\nother parts of the world. In 1893 Britain declared the Solomon Islands a Pro-\ntectorate, and colonial administrators, together with Christian missionaries, in-\ntroduced sweeping changes that included pacification, socio-spatial reorgani-\nzation, and the appointment of village headmen in lieu of ritually anointed\nhybridity, vacuity, and blockage 197\n9 The archaeological record of Pacific diasporas (see Spriggs 1997), as well as oral accounts of\ninter-island exchange and marriage that I collected, reinforce a methodological presupposition that\nprecolonial Arosi took shape through extensive processes of migration and interconnection.\nchiefs. These changes helped to localize \u201cthe Arosi\u201d as a category of people\nregulated in a place called Arosi (Fox 1924:3\u20135). Today the electoral districts\nof Arosi I and II at the northwest end of Makira are nested within the larger\nprovincial and central political order of a nation-state independent since 1978\nand known simply as Solomon Islands. Virtually every aspect of Arosi life has\nbeen transformed: Arosi no longer speak, worship, dress, construct houses,\ncultivate gardens, cook food, or organize communal work in the ways they\nused to do.\nIn the midst of this compounded hybridity, many Arosi are negotiating what\nAppadurai (1996:188) identifies as \u201cthe special problems that beset the pro-\nduction of locality in a world that has become deterritorialized, diasporic, and\ntransnational.\u201d Despite his concern that to cast the production of locality in\nterms of cosmology is to mask its \u201cactive, intentional, and productive charac-\nter\u201d (1996:180), Appadurai resorts to the language of chaos and order. He points\nout that \u201cneighborhoods\u201d\u2014lived social contexts\u2014come into being, not only\nvis-\u00e0-vis one another, but as projects of asserting \u201cpower over places and set-\ntings that are viewed as potentially chaotic or rebellious\u201d (1996:184). The pro-\nduction of locality is, in fact, one of the most tangible registers in which peo-\nple strive to bring order out of chaos. Read in this way as cosmogonic,\ntechniques of locality production may be seen as valuable indicators of what\nconstitutes chaos in a given context. Although encompassed within the chaos\nof postcolonial hybridity, the techniques of locality production prevalent in\nArosi today indicate that the vision of chaos to which these techniques most di-\nrectly respond is not hybridity but semantically empty land. Depopulation and\ndeterritorialization have made coastal land in Arosi a virtual primordial land-\nscape devoid of putatively autochthonous matrilineal landholders. Experienc-\ning this vacuity as both an obstacle and an incentive to the reproduction of their\nlocality, representatives of various Arosi matrilineages are emplacing them-\nselves along the coast in irreconcilable ways.\nHenrietta Moore (1999:16) has observed that, \u201chowever globalized and frag-\nmented the contemporary world is or is said to be, individuals and collectivi-\nties still . . . remain committed to various projects and relationships.\u201d Most peo-\nple, she reminds us, \u201cremain in some relation to integratory concepts and\npractices that help to make life meaningful.\u201d With respect to Arosi, virtually all\nadults clearly articulate what they hold to be the principles of Arosi socio-spa-\ntial order, even though they aver that this \u201ccustom\u201d (Solomon Islands Pijin: kas-\ntom) is no longer practicable. Arosi teach their children that areas of land on\nMakira are held by autochthonous matrilineages, known in Arosi as the auhen-\nua.10 Theoretically, only one matrilineage can be auhenua in any particular\n198 michael w. scott\n10 Although Arosi are familiar with the idea of private property, they have not adopted it. Rare\ninstances in which people have attempted to sell small parcels of matrilineal land or buy the few\nsmall tracts of land previously taken by European planters have resulted in unresolved ambiguities\nof ownership owing to the persistent privileging of matrilineal land tenure.\narea. The matrilineages are exogamous, and the Arosi model of an ideal social\npolity is a multi-lineal community gathered around representatives of an auhen-\nua matrilineage in its ancestral territory. This socio-spatial ideal is, furthermore,\nassociated with an ethical ideal incumbent on the auhenua in their land. As hosts\nto in-marrying women, their children, and other strangers, members of the\nauhenua matrilineage at the center of a polity should be gracious and generous.\nThis means promoting inter-lineage \u201centanglement\u201d (haikawikawi) by permit-\nting non-lineage residents to use land for house construction and subsistence\ngardening, granting access to fruit and nut trees, bestowing exclusively held lin-\neage personal names on non-lineage children, and contributing to feasts or oth-\ner forms of exchange on behalf of such non-lineage persons. The auhenua\nshould foster what one man summed up as \u201clove, peace, and unity.\u201d\nTo sustain their auhenua-based polities, Arosi have always had to contend\nwith the \u201cconditions of anxiety, entropy, social wear and flux, ecological un-\ncertainty and cosmic volatility\u201d that are everywhere inimical to the repro-\nduction of locality (Appadurai 1996:181, 185; cf. Scott 2000:65 \u2013 66). For\nexample, because women usually go to reside and raise children where their\nhusbands are living, matrilineages must work to bring the children back to their\nancestral land to perpetuate their unique lineage-cum-land identities as social\nmagnets. Drawing a contrast between \u201colden times\u201d (\u2018oha bwani) and the pre-\nsent, Arosi say that chiefs, specially anointed to represent the auhenua, formerly\nserved to recruit the auhenua back to their land and mediate the integration of\nothers within their orbit. But beyond the loss of these chiefs, which Arosi spec-\nulate has undermined their ability to live together in clearly grounded polities,\nthree additional concomitants of colonialism\u2014depopulation, dislocation, and\nthe acceptance of Christianity\u2014have compounded the normal chaos of hy-\nbridity, and with it, the usual challenges to locality reproduction.\nFrom the mid-nineteenth century, introduced diseases decimated many Arosi\nvillages (Scott 2001:85\u201391), and assertions that the auhenua matrilineage of a\ngiven place is extinct are now common. Indeed, many Arosi told me that the\nauhenua matrilineages of the coastal land had all been wiped out in these epi-\ndemics. Partly in response to this crisis of disease and depopulation, mission-\naries and Protectorate officials encouraged the resettlement of Arosi living in\nthe bush to the coast in the early twentieth century. Narratives of this period \nof relocation inform a current Arosi discourse through which many people on\nthe coast describe themselves\u2014but more frequently their neighbors\u2014as sae\nboboi, \u201cpeople who have come from elsewhere.\u201d Arosi Anglican Christianity\nhas furthermore rendered attitudes toward the physical markers of matrilineal\nconnection to land highly ambivalent. Although Arosi no longer sacrifice at the\nossuaries and ancestral shrines known as hera, or at the spirit-shark shrines\nknown as birubiru, these sacred sites, collectively designated dora maea, re-\nmain as indices of unique auhenua identities in the land and as the loci of en-\nduring ancestral powers. Most Arosi assume that the spirits of the dead, called\nhybridity, vacuity, and blockage 199\nadaro, are still present and potentially dangerous at several types of dora maea,\nregardless of whether Christian exorcisms have been performed at them. Sev-\neral of my consultants vividly likened the spirits resident at hera and other such\nsites to a radar system: adaro observe everyone in the vicinity and protect those\nwhom they recognize as their descendents but punish unknown interlopers.11\nOwing to differing ideas regarding the relationship between the Christian God\nand the agency of adaro, however, the degree and manner in which adaro con-\ntinue to influence events is subject to differing Arosi interpretations. There are\neven a few people who condemn the reckoning of relationship to land through\ndora maea as \u201carguing from the time of darkness,\u201d the time before Christianity\n(cf. White 1991).\nThese interdependent influences have fostered a general uncertainty among\nArosi regarding the history and nature of the coastal land where nearly every-\none is now concentrated. Many acknowledge that they know neither which ma-\ntrilineages established local shrines nor the names of the dead placed in the hera\nthat still punctuate the coast. After disturbing one such ossuary, one young man\ntold me: \u201cI had a dream after visiting that hera. I didn\u2019t sleep well. I dreamt that\nsomeone was coming toward me with a strong light like a flashlight. Then I\nwoke up.\u201d This dream captures the ambivalence many Arosi feel about their re-\nlationship to the places where they live. They endow the land with keen eyes\nthat scrutinize them, as if under an intense beam of light, but they may not know\nwho sees them and whether they have been seen as a relative or a stranger.\nMoreover, villages, which comprise up to 550 people, cannot be assumed to\nsubsist within the territories of recognizable auhenua matrilineages. Instead,\nwhen Arosi males explain their relationship to the places where they and their\nfamilies live, garden, or collect naturally occurring foods, they regularly say\nthat they \u201ceat through the father\u201d (ngau suri ama), meaning that they enjoy sus-\ntenance from a piece of land because that is where their fathers and grandfa-\nthers previously lived and worked. In contrast, to \u201ceat through the mother\u201d is\nto share prerogatives of land use where one\u2019s matrilineage is auhenua. Many\nArosi explain the prevalence of eating through the father today with reference\nto the extinction of the matrilineages that once were auhenua in the villages.\nWhen one elderly man showed me where he gardened in the land above his vil-\nlage, I inquired whether he had asked permission to garden there. \u201cNo,\u201d he\nreplied, \u201cwhom would I ask? The auhenua lineage is dead. In this village we\nare all people who have come.\u201d On the surface of things, then, there is a con-\nsensus that no one in the coastal villages could justifiably claim to be auhenua;\nthe land ostensibly lies empty of original landholding lineages.\n200 michael w. scott\n11 According to Arosi, adaro are not partial to matrilineal descendents only. Those who might\nfeel comfortable visiting an ancestral site would include the children of lineage males as well as\nmembers of the matrilineage. However, after a number of generations, often said to be five, de-\nscendents of lineage males are no longer thought to be related to the matrilineage. Such people are\nlikely to avoid going to the dora maea in question.\nBut just when the possibility of reproducing Arosi locality in terms of auhen-\nua-centered polities seems most remote, the ordinary ordering impetus to do so\nhas been enhanced by \u201ccontingencies of history, environment, and imagina-\ntion\u201d (Appadurai 1996:185) that have positioned Arosi within a wider inter-\ncontextuality. Specifically, Arosi anxiety that their current disposition on the\nland is incoherent and superficial is exacerbated by fears that insecure coastal\nland may be taken by outsiders or that an imagined diaspora of genuine coastal\nauhenua may return to displace them. In 1896 the British Solomon Islands Pro-\ntectorate introduced the category of \u201cwaste land,\u201d defined as land \u201cvacant by\nreason of the extinction of the original native owners and their descendants\u201d\n(Allan 1957:37). Such land was presumed available for government requisition\nand sale. Although this waste land policy terminated in 1912 (Bennett 2000:41\u2013\n42), some Arosi speculate that, in pursuit of development initiatives, the pre-\nsent government may appropriate land deemed unencumbered by customary\nowners. Thus, one man, formulating his understanding of the Protectorate gov-\nernment\u2019s settlement of Tikopians east of Arosi in the 1960s, observed: \u201cThat\u2019s\nwhat happened at Wairaraha. The lineage of the land was finished and the land\nwas neglected, so the government took it and it became Tikopian land.\u201d He rec-\nognized a possibility that this could happen in his village as well, because, as\nhe said, repeating the regular refrain, \u201cwe are all people who have come from\nelsewhere.\u201d12\nSome Arosi additionally experience their coastal context as part of a global\ncontext of dispersed Arosi matrilineages, representatives of which may return\nto the island to assume their rightful places in the land. Several Arosi confided\nto me their belief that women from their coastal villages had been taken away\nto America and elsewhere, either by the explorer Menda\u00f1a or during the forced\nlabor recruitment of the nineteenth century. These women, they said, had mar-\nried and perpetuated the old coastal matrilineages abroad. The prospect of the\nreturn of their descendants is, for some people, cause for concern. As one old-\ner consultant put it: \u201cIf the lineage of the woman of our village who married at\nAmerica returns, what will we people of the village now say, we who have all\ncome [here]? In our custom there is nothing we could say.\u201d\nGiven these added pressures to reproduce neighborhoods in terms of territo-\nries firmly occupied by auhenua matrilineages, it is not surprising that, despite\nthe apparent consensus that there are no extant coastal auhenua, many Arosi\nmatrilineages are working to emplace themselves as the auhenua of their lit-\ntoral villages with contradictory results. They are doing so unobtrusively, how-\nhybridity, vacuity, and blockage 201\n12 Hviding (1993) presents compelling reasons for thinking that representations of landholding\nunilineal groups in Marovo Lagoon (Western Province, Solomon Islands) are recent \u201cindigenous\nessentialisms\u201d formulated primarily for the consumption of outsiders. As I elucidate below, how-\never, the primacy Arosi grant to matrilineal identity and connection to place is not only a central\nvalue among Arosi themselves but is also integral to a historically engaged but culturally persistent\nArosi model of cosmogony as a constant process.\never, inhibited from openly articulating their identity and land claims by the\nethical dimension of what it means to be auhenua. The expectation that the gen-\nuine auhenua of a place should be open-handed also compels them to humili-\nty toward the dependent guests on their land and discourages unvarnished as-\nsertions of auhenua identity and its prerogatives as incompatible with a true\nauhenua nature. The current processes of coastal auhenua emplacement thus\ncame to my attention as lineage representatives secretly divulged to me ge-\nnealogical narratives according to which their matrilineages alone were the\noriginal autochthonous people where they resided.13 I quickly realized, more-\nover, that different matrilineages were telling me different narratives involving\nmany of the same sacred sites and geographical spaces, making the present-day\nArosi coastline an example of what Foucault (1986:25) termed a \u201cheterotopia,\u201d\na context \u201ccapable of juxtaposing in a single real place several spaces, several\nsites that are in themselves incompatible.\u201d Constituted by diverse matrilineal\npoints of view on the same terrain, this heterotopia is the inadvertent result of\nArosi attempts to order the chaos of a socially depleted landscape through re-\nnewed relationships of mutual generation among matrilineages, places, and the\nancestral subjectivities said to inhabit them (Scott 2001).\nFor the most part, the dynamic of becoming auhenua along the coast today\nimpinges only on each matrilineage\u2019s closely guarded narrative construction of\nthe landscape without altering the land or the disposition of objects within it.\nNevertheless, Arosi reported to me a few anomalous cases of conflict involv-\ning the surreptitious construction of new \u201cancestral\u201d sites and the physical ma-\nnipulation of existing shrines (cf. Guidieri 1980:63\u201364). These new or modi-\nfied structures are the work of those seeking to convince others that the sites\nare evidence of their long-term ancestral presence in the land. The portable\n\u201cshark stones\u201d used in the construction of the shrines known as birubiru appear\nto be especially susceptible to relocation, as all the incidents about which I\nlearned involved these carved rock forms. In fact, without ever pursuing the\nmatter in court, people complained to me that they could have pointed to evi-\ndence of their lineage\u2019s ancient presence in a particular area if interloping pre-\ntenders had not absconded with elements of their ancestral shrines. Long-term\nlack of resolution is typical of such accusations, which tend to remain at the lev-\nel of grumbled grievances in the absence of proof.14\nMore typical than the physical manipulation and creation of new shrines is\n202 michael w. scott\n13 One function of the old anointed chiefs, who frequently were not members of the matrilin-\neages they represented, may have been to articulate these claims on behalf of the requisitely mod-\nest auhenua. It occurs to me that some people may have been eager to repose their self-under-\nstandings with me in the hope that I would likewise express and validate their claims without their\nhaving to do so. \n14 The ethic of the auhenua discussed above also contributes to a general reluctance to make the\nopen identity and land claims that a court hearing would demand. That said, although I was not\naware of any contemporaneous court hearings regarding land during my residence in Arosi, I\nlearned of a few exceptional cases from the past. \nthe intangible process of incorporating existing shrines into lineage narratives.\nOne of the clearest examples of this narrative reformation of ancestral sites oc-\ncurs in an area of land that stretches along the Arosi coast for about seven kilo-\nmeters and extends up into the bush for about eight kilometers. Although the\nextent of the land implicated varies among their accounts, three lineages are in-\ndependently and inconspicuously emplacing themselves in this area in over-\nlapping ways. Each narrative describes specific shrines that are also featured in\nthe other two narratives, but contextualizes these contested shrines within dif-\nferent multifocal systems. At the same time, each narrative populates the con-\ntested shrines with different spirit-sharks and associates them with the deeds of\ndifferent ancestral figures. All of the lineages concerned additionally assume\nthe same lineage name, and each regards the others as upstart impostors. When\nI interviewed them, representatives of each lineage made a point of divulging\nand contradicting aspects of the other lineages\u2019 narratives, of which they were\noften partially aware, in order to alert me that their rivals were \u201ctelling lies.\u201d\nUnderstandably, therefore, all were concerned not to broadcast their narratives\noutside their lineages, lest elements of their accounts be similarly used against\nthem. Accusations presented to me by each lineage about the others included:\nthat the others had come from distant places where they were known by other\nnames; that the interlopers had stolen elements of their shrines and narratives;\nor, that \u201cthey were just telling stories\u201d that were patently untrue.15\nAlong with shrine and narrative elements, lineage personal names are like-\nwise amenable to assimilation by competing lineages. Each matrilineage recy-\ncles an exclusive set of ancestral names, many of which have acquired the pow-\ner to mediate agency respecting certain areas of lineage land. The name of an\nancestor who once lived at a locale becomes connected to that area, often be-\ncause that ancestor is said to have established a shrine there or invested the place\nwith tabus. A child to whom the name of such an ancestor is reassigned literal-\nly \u201ceats food on account of the name\u201d (ngau suri marahu); he or she is em-\npowered to make decisions about the area of land and nut trees that the deceased\nnamesake oversaw. By reusing their personal names, lineages ensure that liv-\ning people continue to look after all of the different areas and local powers that\nconstitute their territories. Often a child is given a name with a view to eventu-\nally bringing that child to live at the place associated with a namesake. There\nis, however, no prohibition against bestowing lineage names on non-matrilin-\neal descendants, and Arosi have regularly followed this practice as a means of\nactivating a child\u2019s affinities with a related matrilineage. This use of names to\nbuild ties across matrilineages easily leads to dissension regarding the origin\nhybridity, vacuity, and blockage 203\n15 In other conflicts that I studied, competing lineages attempted to invalidate each other\u2019s nar-\nrative constructions of the land, not only at the piecemeal level of details regarding specific ances-\ntral sites, but also at the level of the framing of whole lineage narratives. For strikingly similar forms\nof intrigue via genealogical narrative in a very different cultural and political context, see Shryock\n1997.\nand ownership of particular names, and people sometimes bemoan that their\nlineage has lost control of land due to naming: \u201cOur old people named differ-\nent [i.e., non-lineage] people with our lineage\u2019s personal names, and [now these\npeople] have taken our land.\u201d But, a situation that members of one lineage char-\nacterize as name theft, another portrays as the rightful return of a name to their\nland.\nSeeking to secure ties to coastal lands through naming, Arosi matrilineages\nare making concerted efforts to recoup their personal names. This means of lin-\neage emplacement takes two forms: conservation and premature distribution of\nnames. Fearing that others will appropriate their names, lineages increasingly\n\u201chold firmly\u201d (dau babau) onto those names that are not currently in circula-\ntion and warn against disclosing them to others. This strategy creates secret\nstores of unused names and carries the disadvantage of allowing the links be-\ntween names and places to attenuate. A second strategy avoids this problem but\nappears to be at odds with previous Arosi practice. The missionary ethnogra-\npher Charles E. Fox (1924:179) noted, and older Arosi likewise stated to me,\nthat in the past names could only be re-used when no living person bore them.\nNow, however, lineages are attempting \u201cto bring back\u201d their personal names by\nbestowing them on their children even when non-lineage relatives with those\nnames are still living. As a result, Arosi are occasionally puzzled why other peo-\nple have given a child a name already in use, and such situations lead them to\nsuppose that there is no logic governing the way others are naming their chil-\ndren. Rather than a sign of the breakdown of Arosi logic, however, this abro-\ngation of naming convention is, I suggest\u2014together with the physical and nar-\nrative manipulation of sacred sites\u2014part of a cosmologically informed Arosi\nresponse to a socially and morally evacuated postcolonial landscape.\nEthnographers and historians have observed that the arrival of European ex-\nplorers, missionaries, and structures of domination in colonial spaces can pre-\ncipitate a perceived return to an imagined primordial condition or state of chaos\n(Bonnemaison 1994; Lattas 1998; Noyes 1992; Williams 1986:chs. 7\u20139). This\ninsight may be brought into productive correlation with the anthropological\nmeta-cosmology outlined above. Colonial and postcolonial contexts, according\nto this meta-cosmology, are particularly radical, concentrated, and far-reaching\ninstances of the processes of movement, exchange, domination, and coopera-\ntion that continuously shape human relations and sustain the normal chaos of\nhybridity. As such, colonial and postcolonial situations (or conditions of glob-\nalization) highlight a potential practical nexus between the normal chaos of hy-\nbridity and the\u2014often very different\u2014models of chaos prevalent in particular\nneighborhoods. In this conjuncture of chaoses, differences between chaos as the\nconfusion of categories and the situationally available models of chaos with\nwhich historical processes of hybridization may engage are necessarily relevant\nto analyses of any ensuing reordering activities.\nThe forms of renewed matrilineal place-making in Arosi today clearly illus-\n204 michael w. scott\ntrate this principle. A long-term effect of colonialism has been a perceived re-\nturn of Arosi coastal land to a chaotic primordial state antithetical to order, fig-\nured in a variety of Arosi idioms as empty space. It is this perception of an un-\nderlying problematic spatial vacuity that, despite the physical presence of\npeople on the land, is inspiring the activities that are quietly configuring mul-\ntiple incompatible matrilineal territories along the Arosi coastline. Although ac-\ncurately understood as redoubled efforts at order reproduction, these activities\ndo not aim to redefine confused categories. Rather, they reference Arosi rep-\nresentations of an ongoing transition between two contrastive aspects of pri-\nmordiality: one pertaining to ultimate ancestral origins in separate previously\nuninhabited spaces, the other pertaining to the generation of truly human ma-\ntrilineages through processes of place-making.\nAn Arosi vision of primordial spatial vacuity may be inferred from a variety\nof narratives that describe how the mythic progenitors of Arosi matrilineages\narose autochthonously and independently around the island of Makira. Some\nmatrilineages, for example, claim that their ancestors were animate rocks\nformed with the island; others say that they originated from the daughters of\nsnakes; another narrates descent from a female wondrously born from a dead\nmother; another sees itself as the progeny of a supernatural female that emerged\nfrom a well; and two lineages trace themselves to different instances of con-\ngress between two species of quasi-human island beings. Arosi say that these\nearliest ancestors were not yet \u201ctrue people\u201d (inoni mora). True people, orga-\nnized into true matrilineages, came into being only when the different types of\nancestral beings entered into reproductive relations that prefigured matrilineage\nexogamy. Prior to their connections, these pre-human categories anticipated in\ntheir heterogeneity the essential diversity of Arosi matrilineages. But unlike the\nmatrilineages to which they gave rise, these categories first came into being in\nstatic asocial purity at sites that, although discrete from one another, were so-\ncial vacuums.\nJust as these pre-matrilineal categories did not yet enjoy productive relations\nwith one another, they were likewise not yet connected to the specific domains\nthat would become their descendants\u2019 lineage territories. Although understood\nto have been somewhere on Makira\u2014such as a well in the bush or a village of\nrock people\u2014at the moment of spontaneous ancestral emergence, each point\nof ultimate origin was not yet a true place. Spatial analogues to the pre-matri-\nlineal categories, these primordial no-places\u2014not yet situated in a history of\nancestral words and deeds\u2014were merely potential places. They became actu-\nal named places, incorporated within distinct lineage territories, only when the\nforebears of incipient matrilineages moved out from them, shaping extents of\nland around and beyond them through actions that brought both the matrilin-\neages and their specific territories into being.\nDistinct in style and content from tales of ultimate origins, genealogically or-\ndered accounts of first advent in a particular area of land also present a vision\nhybridity, vacuity, and blockage 205\nof primordial chaos as vacuity. Such accounts emphasize that, prior to the time\nof initial incursion, the land in question was empty and had no identity as a\nplace. A commonly held principle of first occupancy, according to which \u201cthe\nland is the land of the lineage that arrived first,\u201d presupposes a pre-social ge-\nography that has not been transformed by the place-making activities of any\nother agents. In the words of some Arosi, this pre-social state is the unsettled\nand unused \u201cvirgin forest\u201d (wabu) that their lineage ancestors were the first to\nclear (cf. Fox 1924:301).16\nThe place-making aspect of Arosi primordiality is, by contrast, a dynamic as-\npect consisting in practices that fuse matrilineages with unique territories and\npromote inter-lineage relations. Genealogical lineage narratives recount how\nthe children in each generation of a nascent matrilineage spread out from the\nabodes of their parents, extending their presence over terrain that thereby be-\ncame their lineage territory. As these ancestors moved into the land, they en-\ngaged in a repertoire of place-making activities: they founded new settlements,\nenshrined their dead, invested the land with tabus, innovated and recycled per-\nsonal names attached to locales, and planted nut trees and gardens. They be-\ncame one with their land, shaping it and being shaped in return into a true ma-\ntrilineage with an exclusively emplaced past (cf. Coppet 1985). Because of this\nmutually constitutive relationship among a lineage, its land, and its dead, land\nthat is unmodified and has received no dead is like a void or black hole that\nthreatens to consume a lineage\u2019s identity (cf. Guidieri 1980:62). Empty space\nmust, therefore, be claimed from this pre-social condition and made into hu-\nmanized places. To humanize a space in this way is to become auhenua there.\nAt the same time, place-making primordiality encompasses the earliest inter-\nactions among emergent matrilineages. As a necessary component of becom-\ning auhenua in their territories, lineage forebears welcomed in-marrying\nwomen, granted the use of gardening land, nut trees, and even lineage-owned\npersonal names to non-lineage relatives, and settled strangers in their midst.\nArosi society is thus envisioned as having taken shape within place-making pri-\nmordiality as a series of spatially discrete multi-lineage aggregates, each bound\ntogether \u201cunder the ruling shadow\u201d (marungi) of an auhenua lineage in its land.\nIn sum, a transition from the primordiality of ultimate origins to place-mak-\ning primordiality is necessary for the construction of a socio-cosmic totality.\nThis transition, in fact, inheres in multiple simultaneous cosmogonic process-\nes that, by their nature, cannot be definitively accomplished but must be pur-\nsued continuously for their ordering benefits to remain in effect. These process-\nes graph perpendicular axes of generative relationships that intersect at, bring\ninto being, and come to depend on, matrilineage territories. The processes that\nanchor matrilineages in particular places constitute a vertical axis, while the\n206 michael w. scott\n16 For similar ideas from the neighboring island of Malaita and in other Austronesian-speaking\ncontexts, see, for example, Burt 1994:24\u201325; Coppet 1985:80; J. Fox 1997; Keesing 1992:\n23\u201325.\nconcurrent processes that forge productive and reproductive relations among\nthem constitute a horizontal axis. Moreover, the structure of this dual-axis Arosi\ncosmogony yields practical consequences: the vertical grounding of matrilin-\neages in their lands is indispensable to the formation of auhenua lineage iden-\ntities, and auhenua lineage identities are the necessary preconditions for viable\nsocial relations among matrilineages. There is a problematic tension, however,\nbetween the two aspects of Arosi primordiality. Whereas the logic of ultimate\norigins allows multiple matrilineages to claim autochthonous status by virtue\nof spontaneous appearance at separate potential places without coming into\nconflict, the logic of place-making introduces the possibility that more than one\nmatrilineage will claim to have moved into and established a relationship with\nthe same geographical space, situating a single shrine, nut tree, or name-gov-\nerned locale in different matrilineal territories and narratives. The potential for\nmutually disqualifying constructions of space, it seems, accompanies this way\nof coming into being in the land as a form of cosmologically ordered socio-spa-\ntial disorder.\nOnce discerned, the Arosi cosmogonic transition from one aspect of primor-\ndiality to another renders the motivation behind the present efflorescence of\ncoastal auhenua identities apparent. Without grounded auhenua matrilineages,\nArosi socio-cosmic order reverts to a chaos of vacuity. But, wherever land is\nseen to be empty of auhenua, Arosi cosmic and social order abhors such a vac-\nuum and seeks to fill it. Matrilineages cannot easily maintain their identities\nwithout ancestral emplacement, and they struggle to find a foundation for prop-\ner relations with one another without the center of gravity that an auhenua ma-\ntrilineage in its land provides. At any given place, someone has to be auhenua\nin order for Arosi to achieve satisfactory cosmos and society there.\nIt thus transpires that, even as the postcolonial intensification of chaos as hy-\nbridity undermines the anchored auhenua identities necessary for locality re-\nproduction, it precipitates an experience of chaos as vacuity that is, by contrast,\nespecially conducive to the formation of such identities. The attitudes and as-\nsumptions prevalent in everyday Arosi discourse\u2014the frequent assertion that\nthe auhenua of the coast are dead, the reiteration that the present coastal Arosi\nhave come from elsewhere, the ambiguous nature of ancestral powers in a\nChristian context, and uncertainty regarding the history of the coastal land\u2014\nconverge to foster a virtual return to the condition of ultimate origins in which\nland is conceptualized as empty and available to be shaped and socialized by\nthe activities of latter-day matrilineage ancestors.17\nhybridity, vacuity, and blockage 207\n17 Rhys Jones\u2019 (1985:207) representation of the reaction of Frank Gurrmanamana, an Australian\nAborigine from Arnhem Land, to the city of Canberra provides a parallel case. To the eyes of Gurr-\nmanamana, \u201c[h]ere was a land empty of religious affiliation; there were no wells, no names of the\ntotemic ancestors, no immutable links between land, people and the rest of the natural and super-\nnatural worlds. Here was just a vast tabula rasa, cauterised of meaning . . . in his own words \u2018this\ncountry bin lose \u2018im Dreaming.\u2019 . . . This land and its people therefore were analogous to the state\nThe coexistence of competing matrilineal constructions of space in Arosi re-\nmains out of focus in its lived details, however, if regarded only from the ana-\nlytical distance of an anthropological cosmology that sees it primarily as the re-\nsult of attempts to reinvent difference under conditions of normal or intensified\nhybridity. When grounded also in an appreciation of what constitutes a condi-\ntion contrary to order among Arosi, the methods of matrilineal place-making\nand their conflicting results come into relief as processes of order production\nspecific to a colonially mediated realization of a particular vision of chaos\u2014\nthat of primordial vacuity. If postcolonial hybridity is the encompassing con-\ntext of conflicting Arosi efforts at place-making, hybridity itself is not the im-\nmediate problem. It is not the case that uncertainty resides at the level of who\nbelongs to which matrilineage. The matrilineal categories are clear, but empty\nland cannot embody them as such and give them agency as the social and spa-\ntial centers of neighborhoods. Rather than employing techniques of differ-\nentiation to sort out their lineage-cum-land identities, therefore, Arosi are re-\nsponding to the perceived reversion of their coastal land to primordial vacuity\nwith a variety of practices and discourses informed by the actions of ancestral\npioneers. The construction of shrines, the incorporation of existing shrines into\nlineage narratives, and the reclamation of lineage-specific personal names are\nonly three of several possible renewals of ancestral activity through which pre-\nsent-day lineage representatives are anchoring themselves in otherwise lifeless,\nmeaningless, and potentially alienable land. Experience of one type of chaos\n(hybridity) has activated representations of another (vacuity) and proliferated\nnew transformations of the order-promoting practices appropriate to the latter.\nchaos as obstruction and the sacrifice \nof \u201cblocked bodies\u201d in burundi and rwanda\nI have presented an analysis of chaotic vacuity in Arosi in support of the pro-\nposal that the meta-cosmology embedded in current anthropological theory\nshould be coordinated with attention to the models of chaos and order produc-\ntion available to the imaginations of subjects in their distinctive situations. To\nreinforce this point with reference to another model of chaos\u2014that of physical\nobstruction\u2014I juxtapose two independent analyses of late twentieth-century\nviolence in Burundi and Rwanda. Applying the meta-cosmology of anthropo-\nlogical theory to the 1972 massacres of Hutu by Tutsi in Burundi, Appadurai\n(1998) offers a reading of these atrocities that, I suggest, casts them as acts of\nneo-cosmogonic dismemberment in response to hybridity. Tracing out the sym-\nbolism of a cosmology shared by Hutu and Tutsi in both Burundi and Rwanda,\nTaylor (1999) interprets the comparable Rwandan Hutu on Tutsi killings of\n208 michael w. scott\nof all the world once in some time before the Dreaming, before the great totemic Ancestral Beings\nstrode across it, naming the places and giving it meaning. Viewed from this perspective, the Can-\nberra of the geometric streets, and the paddocks of the six-wire fences were places not of domesti-\ncated order, but rather a wilderness of primordial chaos.\u201d\n1994, as well as the earlier Burundi massacres, as the sacrifice of \u201cblocked bod-\nies\u201d designed to restore the orderly flow of life-giving forces and substances\nwithin the body politic. Neither author appears aware of the other\u2019s interpreta-\ntion, but they are complementary rather than competing. Together they shed\nmaximum light on the meaning of violence in this central African context and\nshow how the universal impetus to order presumed in the meta-cosmology of\ntheory can be mediated in practice through the symbolism of a particular cos-\nmology.\nIn a comparative study of \u201cvivisectionist violence\u201d among former intimates\nunder conditions of globalization, Appadurai (1998) tests a hypothesis that\nthere is a correlation between increased uncertainty regarding ethnic identities\nand an upsurge in ethnic violence. He takes as one test case the violence per-\npetrated by Tutsi against Hutu in Burundi during the early 1970s as described\nin survivors\u2019 oral testimonies and analyzed by Liisa Malkki (1995). Hutu and\nTutsi share what Malkki (1995:78\u201395) terms \u201cbody maps,\u201d sets of physical\nmarkers that enable them to identify each other (e.g., Hutu bear an \u201cM\u201d in the\nlines on their palms; Tutsi have straight calves while Hutu have rounded ones;\nTutsi have black gums while Hutu have pink; Tutsi are tall, etc.). Drawing on\nMary Douglas\u2019 thesis that the body is universally a microcosm of the categor-\nical distinctions relevant to particular cosmologies, Appadurai (1998:231) ar-\ngues that the violence enacted on Hutu bodies by Tutsi was, in part, an enraged\nresponse to the failure of real bodies accurately to display these marks of dis-\ntinction. Under the conditions of postcoloniality, the dividing lines between\nthese ethnic categories had become intolerably blurred and could be restored\nonly by opening ambiguous bodies up to exploratory light and gaze. Conform-\ning to a logic that may, Appadurai (1998:232, 233) speculates, be operative in\nwidely different contexts, the chaos of hybridity manifested in uncertain ethnic\nidentities inspired acts of dismemberment as the means \u201cto stabilize,\u201d \u201cto elim-\ninate flux,\u201d and \u201cto establish the parameters\u201d of otherness. Butchery served the\nneo-cosmogonic function of restoring order by separating pure categories out\nof a chaotic mix.\nAppadurai\u2019s analysis is compelling as far as it goes, but he is aware that it\ndoes not account for \u201cthe quasi-ritual order, the attention to detail, the speci-\nficity of bodily violation, the systematicity of the forms of degradation\u201d\n(1998:243) that Malkki\u2019s consultants describe. Although seeming to credit\nMalkki\u2019s \u201cbody maps\u201d with the power to explain \u201cthe specific ways in which\nHutu men and women were killed\u201d\u2014including methods involving impalement\nalong the anus to head or vagina to head axis, forced incest, and forced endo-\ncannibalism between mother and fetus\u2014Appadurai (1998:230\u201331) concedes\nthat \u201c[i]t remains to draw out the link between the mapped body of the ethnic\nother and the peculiar and specific brutalities\u201d in question. \u201c[A]n additional in-\nterpretive frame\u201d is required, he concludes, but offers only \u201csurplus rage\u201d as the\nmissing ingredient that somehow \u201cmakes sense\u201d of these details (1998:243). At\nhybridity, vacuity, and blockage 209\nmost, Appadurai\u2019s correlation of uncertainty with vivisectionist violence makes\nsense of the Burundi massacres only at the grossest level of cutting open and\napart as techniques for achieving distinctions with \u201cdead certainty.\u201d\nTaylor\u2019s work provides the additional interpretive frame capable of supple-\nmenting Appadurai\u2019s contribution with a clearer focus on the \u201croutinized sym-\nbolic schemes of nightmarish cruelty\u201d (Malkki 1995:92) encountered in Bu-\nrundi and Rwanda. Citing Malkki, Taylor (1999:104\u20135) points out that, despite\ngestures toward the need for symbolic analysis of the \u201ctechniques of cruelty\u201d\nthat were \u201calready meaningful, already mythico-historical\u201d to Tutsi and Hutu\n(Malkki 1995:94), she attempts no such analysis, and the \u201cbody maps\u201d she iden-\ntifies give little hermeneutic purchase on these techniques. What is needed, Tay-\nlor argues, is attention to the recursive symbolism of a Rwanda-Burundian cos-\nmology according to which all things depend on the continuous circulation of\nlife-giving forces and substances mediated by relationships of reciprocal ex-\nchange. Central to this symbolism is the microcosmic body, assimilated at once\nto the natural order and the body politic as a conduit of vitality equally suscep-\ntible to states of ordered flow and chaotic blockage. It is this \u201cflow\/blockage\ndialectic\u201d played out on the microcosmic body that best accounts, according to\nTaylor, for some of the techniques of cruelty employed by Hutu and Tutsi in\ntheir reciprocal exchanges of violence.\nReturning to analyses elaborated in an earlier ethnography of the transfor-\nmation of popular medicine in Rwanda, Taylor (1992; 1999) rehearses the mul-\ntiple registers in which the symbolism of flow and blockage is legible: disease\nand healing; sacral kingship and its rituals; a gift economy, especially as in-\nstantiated by asymmetrical exchanges between patrons and clients; and con-\nceptualizations of local topography. Each of these registers represents forms of\ncontinuous flow as conditions of life-giving order and forms of obstruction as\nlife-threatening chaos. Signs of order include bodily orifices and internal tracts\nthat are open, clear, and successfully engaged in ingestive, evacuative, and re-\nproductive functions; freely moving watercourses and navigable pathways; pa-\ntron-client reciprocity; timely and adequate rainfall understood as celestial vi-\ntality mediated to earth by the king. Conversely, signs of chaos include closed\nbodily orifices and blocked internal tracts producing sickness and infertility;\nclogged rivers and roadblocks; exploitation of patrons by clients; and drought\nor famine indicative of a weak or corrupt ruler. This cosmology furthermore\ncomprehends the category of \u201cblocked beings,\u201d agents perceived to embody the\ncondition of chaotic obstruction. Among this class of beings are sorcerers who\ninflict illness by causing blockages in other people\u2019s bodies; enemies of the king\nor even the king himself as an ambivalent figure able to control both flow and\nblockage; and young girls who, although old enough for child bearing, lack de-\nveloped breasts or have not yet begun to menstruate. In precolonial times, the\nlatter two exemplars of the blocked being category might be ritually sacrificed\nfor the health of the physical realm and the community. Such a being was not\n210 michael w. scott\nonly blocked but blocking and needed to be eliminated like an internal ob-\nstruction from the social body.\nTaylor\u2019s study of Rwandan royal ideology and healing practices during the\n1980s equipped him with a symbolic literacy that made the messages inscribed\non Tutsi bodies by Hutu in the 1990s decipherable. As several of the most hor-\nrific techniques of cruelty perpetrated in Rwanda replicated those described by\nMalkki\u2019s Hutu consultants, Taylor (1999:146) also applies his interpretations\nretrospectively to the 1972 violence in Burundi. In both contexts, the perpetra-\ntors of genocide were casting their victims as blocked and blocking beings\nwhose existence threatened the body politic with the chaos of obstruction. Act-\ning in ways that made them analogous to the ancient king or popular healer, the\ng\u00e9nocidaires appropriated the power to control and intervene in the processes\nof flow and blockage through manipulation of their victims\u2019bodies. Several no-\ntorious techniques of cruelty objectify a process whereby the victimizers first\ncontained their victims and inscribed on their bodies their blocked and block-\ning natures before killing them in order to remove this blockage and restore or-\ndered flow. Impalement along the vertical axis of the digestive or reproductive\ntract, for example, constitutes total occlusion of these conduits of vitality, ren-\ndering the victim not only physically dead but symbolic of death as a state of\nself-contained closure. Forced endo-cannibalism of an aborted fetus by its\nmother likewise graphically displays the idea of a closed-circuit exchange, a\ndead end. In cases of forced incest as well, the victims become icons of \u201cmis-\ndirected flows\u201d (Taylor 1999:141) that are internal to one family rather than ex-\nternal and interconnecting among many.\nThis hermeneutic of flow and blockage also enables Taylor to read addition-\nal modes of atrocity documented only in Rwanda. Emasculation and debreast-\ning of Tutsi by Hutu in the Rwandan genocide emerge as further techniques for\nthe sacrificial representation of blocked beings whose life-giving fluids have\nbeen stopped up. Perhaps the most pervasive techniques to which Taylor ap-\nplies this hermeneutic, however, are the multiple modes of immobilization,\nranging from a superabundance of roadblocks in excess of the number required\nto contain the fleeing Tutsi, to the cutting off of legs and feet, and the system-\natic slashing of Achilles tendons\u2014even on the already infirm incapable of\nflight. These forms of immobilization imposed a collective stasis on the whole\nTutsi category within the borders of Rwanda as a prelude to purging them from\nthe nation-state.\nThat the analyses of Taylor and Appadurai are not incompatible is evident\nfrom Taylor\u2019s recognition that, inasmuch as the conditions of flow and block-\nage became assimilated, in the nationalism of the Hutu g\u00e9nocidaires of Rwan-\nda, to the ethnicized categories Hutu and Tutsi, the chaos of hybridity between\nthese valorized categories was also at play, motivating \u201cgenocide aimed at re-\nasserting the cosmic order of the Hutu state\u201d (Taylor 1999:154). Clearly, in or-\nder to purge the blocked and blocking category Tutsi from the body politic one\nhybridity, vacuity, and blockage 211\nmust be able to separate Tutsi from Hutu, and Taylor acknowledges that the\n\u201cbody maps\u201d identified by Malkki were employed by Hutu against Tutsi in\nRwanda just as they had been by Tutsi against Hutu in Burundi. But the pri-\nmary targets of the rage inspired by recalcitrant bodies and the chaos of hy-\nbridity in Rwanda were, according to Taylor (1999:ch. 4), Tutsi women. Being\nfrequently the wives and mistresses of Hutu men and the \u201cpotential mothers of\nethnically anomalous children,\u201d Tutsi women were \u201climinoid beings.\u201d They\nwere doubly chaotic, simultaneously embodying the chaos of obstruction as\nTutsi and the chaos of hybridity as partners in miscegenation. Taylor reports\nthat, in addition to suffering the tortures already discussed, many Tutsi women\nwere also subjected to rape and sexual captivity, acts which Appadurai\n(1998:239\u201340) suggests may be methods \u201cto expose, penetrate, and occupy the\nmaterial form\u2014the body\u2014of the ethnic other\u201d as part of a program of \u201cpro-\nducing persons\u201d as tokens of clear-cut ontological types. When brought to-\ngether in this way, the meta-cosmological analysis of Appadurai and the cos-\nmological analysis of Taylor bring the position of the Tutsi woman into its\nfullest appalling focus. By a variety of symbolic means, the body of a Tutsi\nwoman was good to control, for to do so was to fight chaos on two fronts.\nconclusion: comparative chaos and the uses of cosmology\nAdvocating a return to \u201cGrand Theory\u201d in anthropology \u201caccompanied by a\ncritical politics,\u201d Moore (1997) has forwarded postcolonialism as a useful com-\nparative \u201cconcept-metaphor\u201d in the pursuit of these allied objectives. Concept-\nmetaphors, she explains, are the necessary rubrics for cross-cultural study\u2014\nsuch as \u201cthe body,\u201d \u201cthe self,\u201d and \u201cgender\u201d\u2014that can provide a nexus between\nthe universal and the particular and facilitate the linked production of theory\nand ethnography. These rubrics are serviceable to this task because their mean-\nings are at once taken for granted and unspecifiable. As ideal constructs they\nare \u201cmetaphors which have no adequate referents\u201d (Moore 1997:140), and it is\ntherefore not possible to define them either univocally or exhaustively. An-\nthropological understanding of particularities and the refinement of theoretical\nmodels take place precisely when the gaps and misfits between these metaphors\nand their referents are pried open and scrutinized. In adding postcolonialism to\nthe list of potential concept-metaphors, Moore advances a trope that asserts the\nuniversality of hybridity in a globalizing world while acknowledging a spec-\ntrum of relative degrees of hybridity in actual experience. The concept-\nmetaphor postcolonialism thus seems to bear a trope within a trope, for its\nsalient characteristic, Moore (1997:132, 141\u201342) implies, is hybridity. This hy-\nbridity is furthermore a species of chaos with a built-in praxis of order repro-\nduction: \u201cIn order to know who I am, you must be different from me. We all\nneed histories, and their violent making and remaking is one consequence of\nthe kind of postcolonial space we inhabit\u201d (1997:142). Building on the ratio-\nnale and content of Moore\u2019s proposal, I conclude with the suggestion that the\n212 michael w. scott\nethnographic cases I have presented indicate an instructive gap between the\nconcept-metaphor postcolonialism\u2014understood as the chaos of hybridity\u2014\nand the plurality of conceptualizations of chaos that inform practical order pro-\nduction in particular contexts.\nThe methods of matrilineal emplacement in Arosi and the techniques of cru-\nelty in Burundi and Rwanda warrant the promotion of chaos itself, which en-\ncompasses hybridity as one among many possible visions of disorder, as a com-\nparative concept-metaphor in anthropological theorizing and the interpretation\nof social practices. With its privileging of hybridity as the universal condition\nof chaos, the meta-cosmology of contemporary theory fosters analyses of prac-\ntices as responses to the disconcerting mixing and blurring of categories. \nAlthough Appadurai\u2019s work on vivisectionist violence demonstrates the ex-\nplanatory benefits this specification of chaos can have, these benefits can be\nenhanced, I submit, by also asking: with what other visions of chaos does the\nchaos of hybridity articulate in history? Even within the wider context of chaot-\nic hybridity, glossed as postcoloniality, postmodernity, or globalization, people\ncontinue to experience chaos as they know it. Hybridity is not the only model\nof chaos, and re-parsing is not the only technique for order making. Further-\nmore, as in Rwanda, social agents may be drawing on more than one model of\nchaos as they struggle to refashion order. Accordingly, we need to allow a less\nprescriptive meta-cosmology of the universal, ongoing, and multiple transitions\nfrom chaos to order to elicit this plurality of chaoses, not obscure it under a sin-\ngle master trope. But the existence of a significant gap or misfit between hy-\nbridity and the other models of chaos evident in contexts such as Arosi and\nRwanda-Burundi need not lead to a particularist paralysis that leaves these\nmodels of chaos incommensurable (cf. Moore 1997:134\u201335). Rather, the sub-\nstitution of a more polysemous notion of chaos in place of hybridity in current\nanthropological cosmology strengthens its universalist claims while mandating\na comparative study of chaos that seeks to understand how particular models\nof primordiality or the breakdown of order represent both disorder and its like-\nly remedies. This is only to take history seriously as having produced different\nvisions of chaos that are, after all, still obstacles to mutual transparency but nev-\nertheless comprehensible as manifestations of a universal dialectic.\nAnd here, a final issue obtrudes on this discussion. If anthropological meta-\ncosmology claims that human ontology predisposes us to engage in multiple,\ncontinuous, and imperfect strategies for bringing order out of chaos, it needs\nalso to assert that this recognition of the eternal return of chaos is not a fatalis-\ntic acceptance that some modes of order production will be violent. Recently,\ninfluential interpreters of religious cosmologies have been criticized for aes-\ntheticizing visions of life born out of death and cosmic cycles of periodic de-\nstruction and rebirth as necessary to a supra-moral dialectic (Wasserstrom\n1999). Another reason, then, to acknowledge that anthropological theory en-\ntails a meta-cosmology that encrypts pseudo-mythic narratives is to guard\nhybridity, vacuity, and blockage 213\nagainst a similar tendency, or even its inadvertent appearance. When reckoning\nwith models of chaos and their possible practical ramifications, social scientists\nmust be clear that forms of order production are not morally neutral, and our\nflirtations with the renovative potentialities of hybridity must reject any implicit\nnihilistic attraction to order dissolution. All visions of chaos raise serious ethi-\ncal questions about what ought to constitute proper order, and many seem to\nencode praxes susceptible to abhorrent deformation.18 While order production\nmay be necessary, not all forms of order production are acceptable and none is\ninevitable. A return to Grand Theory in anthropology accompanied by a criti-\ncal politics enjoins, therefore, not only the breakdown of essentialized di-\nchotomies between Self and Other, but a project of imagining cosmologically\nsatisfying alternatives to order by atrocity.\nreferences\nAbu-Lughod, Lila. 1991.
