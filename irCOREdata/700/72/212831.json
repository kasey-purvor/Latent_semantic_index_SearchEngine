If financial incentives improve adherence and lead to better health and\nsocial outcomes, they may be recommended as one option to improve the treatment of non-\nadherent patients with psychotic disorders.\nTrial Registration: Current controlled trials ISRCTN77769281.\nBackground\nVarious clinical interventions have been tested to achieve\nadherence in non-adherent patients with psychotic disor-\nders, including compliance therapy, psychotherapy, fam-\nily education, telephone prompting and psycho\neducation. A review focusing on studies involving patients\nwith chronic health problems [1] and a meta-analysis of\nstudies to enhance adherence in psychiatric patients [2]\nfound a modest effect of some interventions (effect size of\n.36 in psychiatric patients). Yet, there is no consistent evi-\ndence for any intervention to significantly improve medi-\ncation adherence in non-adherent community patients\nwith psychotic disorders.\nGuiffrida and Togerson, 1997 [3] conducted a systematic\nreview on financial incentives to increase adherence to\nhealth care treatments. They identified 11 randomised\ncontrolled trials, all from the USA. In 10 studies financial\nincentives enhanced adherence to anti-tuberculosis drugs,\ndental care, a weight reduction programme, substance\ndependency treatment, and anti hypertensive medication\nwith odds ratios of up to 7 for anti-tuberculosis treatment.\nOnly one study in the review addressed a mental health\nissue, i.e. adherence to cocaine dependency treatment.\nOne non-randomised study of patients with dual diagno-\nsis found that modest rewards enhanced attendance to the\nprogramme [4].\nSince there is no published review specifically on studies\nin patients with mental health problems, we conducted\nour own review. The following databases were searched\nfor studies: AMED, EBM, EMBASE, MEDLINE and Psy-\ncINFO. The following keywords were combined simulta-\nneously to identify studies: medication, therapy,\nappointment, compliance, adherence, mental health,\nmental illness and psychiatr, with the terms incentive,\ncompliance, money, payment, contingency management,\nvoucher and material. We found 13 USA based studies [4-\n16] where incentives have been used to encourage adher-\nence to treatment in people with mental health problems,\n10 of which included people with substance misuse and\nmental health problems. One study was carried out in the\nUK [17]. Treatment included attendance of therapeutic\nsessions and out-patient clinics, and abstinence from\nsmoking or substance abuse. Incentives offered were in\nthe form of a direct payment of vouchers, money or\ntokens. Nine out of the fourteen studies were within-sub-\njects designs and four studies were controlled trials. Two\ncontrolled trials examined the effect of offering incentives\nto promote abstinence from substances, one studied\nactive involvement in inpatient group meetings and one\ncombined attendance at compensated work therapy and\nabstinence from substances. In all of the studies, the indi-\nviduals' adherence\/abstinence was significantly improved\nwhen incentives were offered. In half of the studies, the\nimprovement in outcome was maintained even when the\nincentive had been taken away. None of these studies\nreferred to any problems or concerns raised in offering\nincentives. Yet, we did not find a single controlled study\ntesting financial incentives to improve medication adher-\nence in patients with mental health disorders.\nA recent publication from the UK reported the use of\nfinancial incentives in non-adherent patients in Assertive\nOutreach Teams (AOTs) [17]. Four out of 5 patients who\nwere offered the scheme accepted. All had improved\nadherence to medication and three remained without\nhospital admissions throughout the observation period\nalthough they had been frequently admitted before the\nscheme. No wider research has so far been published.\nThe use of financial incentives to increase adherence to\nanti-psychotic medication also raises ethical concerns as\nshown in a survey of AOT managers in England [18]. A\nrecent study (Priebe et al, in preparation) explored the\nviews and attitudes of different stakeholder groups related\nto the use of financial incentives in mental health care.\nPractically all stakeholder groups identified the issue of\neffectiveness as critical for their view of the intervention\nand asked for systematic research to establish its effective-\nness.\nA clinical trial on the effectiveness of financial incentives\nwill inform the ethical debate on the principle of provid-\ning such an intervention [18]. One of four categories for\njudging the ethical dimension of medical interventions is\ntheir beneficence [19]. Beneficence is closely linked to\neffectiveness, and identifying effectiveness requires a ran-\ndomised controlled trial. Although there may be various\nindications that financial incentives are likely to increasePage 2 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Psychiatry 2009, 9:61 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-244X\/9\/61adherence to anti-psychotic maintenance medication in\npreviously non-adherent patients, the effectiveness and\ncost-effectiveness of the intervention has never been\nestablished in a randomised design, and a randomised\ncontrolled trial is required before the wider use of the\nintervention should be recommended.\nMethods\nDesign\nIn a cluster randomised controlled trial, community\nteams caring for patients with psychotic disorders in the\ncommunity, currently AOTs, will be randomly allocated\nto the intervention group or control condition. The allo-\ncation of teams, and not individual patients, will prevent\ncontamination of practice within teams and facilitate the\nassessment of overall experiences in teams with the prac-\ntice. It will also make it possible for teams in the experi-\nmental group to offer financial incentives to further\npatients outside the study, without compromising the\nstudy design. Teams might consider this to avoid a sense\nof unfairness among patients cared for by the same team\nor simply to have more patients benefiting from the inter-\nvention. Outcomes will be analysed on the level of indi-\nvidual patients. The effect of clustering of patients within\nteams will be controlled for in a mixed effects model. The\ntrial will not be 'blind', as masking of patients and clini-\ncians is impossible. Yet, the primary outcome criterion\n(percentage of injections taken) and secondary outcomes,\nwith the exceptions of global clinical improvement which\nis rated by clinicians and subjective quality of life and\ntreatment satisfaction which is rated by patients, can be\nobtained objectively and are taken from the medical\nrecords, and should therefore not be influenced by lack of\nmasking.\nAOTs will first be approached and informed about the\nstudy through the National Forum for Assertive Outreach\nand local collaborators at study centres in London,\nOxford and Liverpool. We will approach around 100\nAOTs that are based within reasonable distance of the\nstudy sites so that regular travelling to the teams is realis-\ntic. AOTs will receive information about the study on\nregional and national meetings of AOTs and material cir-\nculated through email. This will be followed up by direct\ntelephone calls of the director of the National Forum for\nAssertive Outreach and other members of the research\nteam including the research assistants. Although we\nexpect that a number of teams will object to either the\npractice of offering financial incentives or being randomly\nallocated within a research design or both, informal con-\nsultations showed that we can expect more than 36 teams\nto volunteer for participation in the study. To include an\nAOT in the pool of eligible teams we will ask for prelimi-\nnary informed consent by the team manager. AOTs\nalready practising a financial incentive scheme will be\nexcluded. Yet, a survey conducted in 2006 [18] identified\nonly one AOT in England using financial incentives at the\ntime, and this number is unlikely to have increased sub-\nstantially since. We will then randomly select 36 teams\nout of the pool of volunteering teams, allowing for two\nteams to drop out in the further procedure before the trial\nbegins.\nAll recruited teams will be visited by a member of the\nresearch team to explain the nature of the intervention\nand the study. Clinicians and managers in all teams will\nreceive a structured presentation addressing the research\nbackground, the design of the trial, and ethical as well as\npractical issues of implementation. Written informed con-\nsent to participate will then be obtained from team man-\nagers and psychiatrist consultants.\nThe next step will be to identify patients in each team ful-\nfilling the inclusion criteria. We expect the number of\npatients in most teams to vary between 5 and 8. We expect\nto recruit 4 patients per team and will randomly select\npatients if required. These patients will be informed about\nthe study by a clinician and then approached by a\nresearcher for written informed consent for their data to\nbe used in research and for participating in a trial, in\nwhich patients in some but not all teams are offered finan-\ncial incentives to improve medication adherence. If\npatients cannot be contacted initially or do not provide\nwritten informed consent, further patients fulfilling the\ninclusion criteria will be recruited from the participating\nteams until the total sample size is reached. Selecting and\nrecruiting patients before randomisation is essential to\navoid a possible bias in the selection and recruitment pro-\ncedures based on awareness of whether patients will be in\nthe experimental or control group. After this one-off con-\ntact between the patient and a research assistant, there will\nbe no requirement for further contacts between research\nassistants and patients in either group. Following the ini-\ntial interview, patients are not required to participate in\nany research interviews or assessments at any point of\ntime. This simple and non-intrusive procedure is meant to\nminimise the number of non-consenting patients (which\nalways is a problem with research in challenging patients\nin AOTs) and avoid a selection bias as far as possible.\nOnly if patients volunteer to be contacted at the end of the\ntrial again, a researcher will attempt such contact (possi-\nbly via telephone) to ask 11 questions on patient reported\noutcomes.\nAfter the recruitment of patients, 34 AOTs will be ran-\ndomly allocated to the intervention or control condition\nstratifying for the type of catchment area (i.e. inner city,\nsuburban or rural).Page 3 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Psychiatry 2009, 9:61 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-244X\/9\/61Planned interventions\nPatients in the AOTs that have been allocated to the inter-\nvention will be offered a financial incentive for each depot\ninjection of anti-psychotic medication for a 12 month\nperiod. Patients will receive \u00a315 for one injection with the\ntotal sum not exceeding \u00a360 for a four-week period (the\nmaximum number of injections is 4 per month). The\nadministering clinician will give the money in cash\ndirectly after the injection. Patients will sign a receipt.\nThere are several reasons to set a standard sum of \u00a315 for\neach depot injection:\n\u2022 A fixed sum per injection simplifies the practice and\nmakes it transparent for all clinicians and patients\ninvolved.\n\u2022 The sum of \u00a315 is in line with the successful open pilot\nstudy in East London.\n\u2022 The sum is below the limit of \u00a320 per week which would\ninterfere with patients' disability benefits. Most patients\neligible for the study receive Disability Living Allowance,\nIncome Support with Disability Premium, or Incapacity\nBenefit. In all of these cases, patients are not entitled to\nhave a separate income of more than \u00a320 (including ther-\napeutic earnings and income through research participa-\ntion) without having their benefits reduced.\n\u2022 \u00a315 per injection is intended to be an incentive helping\npersuade otherwise ambivalent patients. Yet, it is impor-\ntant to limit the total sum to a maximum of \u00a360 per four\nweeks so that patients do not become financially depend-\nent on the additional income. The money is intended to\nprovide an incentive, but not lead to financial dependence\non the scheme.\nOtherwise all patients will receive treatment as usual. The\ntype, frequency and dosage medication and all other\ninterventions will not be affected by participation in the\nstudy.\nMembers of the research team will attend meetings of\neach AOT in the intervention group and discuss again the\npractice of offering financial incentives and the nature of\nthe study. Following that there will be a brief training pro-\ngramme on the exact procedure. The procedure of the\nintervention will also be outlined in a written manual. All\nteams will then be regularly visited by the research assist-\nants and, if required, also by members of the team of\napplicants. A discussion of the practice at a team meeting\nwill be repeated after 6 months of the intervention period.\nInclusion criteria\nThe only inclusion criterion for teams is that they care for\npatients with psychotic disorders who have problems\nadhering to antipsychotic maintenance medication. These\nare currently dedicated AOTs with a corresponding policy.\nThe only exclusion criteria are lack of willingness to par-\nticipate and an already existing practice of offering finan-\ncial incentives to patients with problematic medication\nadherence.\nFor patients in the AOTs there are the following inclusion\ncriteria:\n\u2022 being cared for in the AOT for at least 4 months,\n\u2022 between 18 and 65 years of age,\n\u2022 capacity to give informed consent to participate in the\nstudy and actual written informed consent,\n\u2022 an established diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizo-affec-\ntive psychosis, or bipolar illness according to ICD-10,\n\u2022 being prescribed depot injections of anti-psychotic med-\nication,\n\u2022 poor adherence to anti-psychotic medication, i.e. missed\n50% or more of prescribed depot injections over the last 4\nmonths (so that the percentage of taken depots is based\non a minimum of 4 prescribed depots), and\n\u2022 failure of all other methods available to the team to\nensure adherence to medication.\nExclusion criteria\nExclusion criteria are:\n\u2022 learning difficulty\n\u2022 poor command of English so that clinical communica-\ntion and discussion of agreements is impaired\nOutcome measures\nThe primary outcome is adherence to anti-psychotic\nmaintenance medication during the 12 month trial\nperiod. Adherence will be measured, objectively, as the\npercentage of prescribed depot injections actually taken.\nAs the primary outcome, the percentage will be used as a\ncontinuous variable. However, we will also analyse the\npercentage in a dichotomised way, comparing the ratio of\npatients with 'good' adherence (i.e. =80% of prescribed\ndepots taken [20]) in the two conditions.\nFurther secondary outcomes are:\na) The time 'slippage' of taking depots, defined as the per-\ncentage of the prescribed time interval that has expired\nbefore the depot is taken;Page 4 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Psychiatry 2009, 9:61 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-244X\/9\/61b) Clinical improvement as assessed on the Clinical Glo-\nbal Impression Scale (CGI) [21] by the treating consultant\npsychiatrist at the end of the 12 month period;\nb) Number of involuntary and voluntary hospital admis-\nsions during the trial period;\nc) Costs of care: data on the use and frequency of use of\ninpatient care, outpatient care (including home visits,\nhome treatment), and other health services during the 12\nmonth treatment period will be obtained from case notes\nand electronic administrative data bases. Costs for the\nintervention will be estimated for each participating team\nfrom information provided by staff. Established national\nunit costs will be used to estimate direct health care.\nd) The number of attempted and completed suicides, inci-\ndences of physical violence, police arrests and days spent\nat work\/training\/education will also be recorded over the\n12 month trial period.\ne) Subjective quality of life and satisfaction with medica-\ntion which will be assessed at the beginning and end of\nthe intervention period using the 11 item scale estab-\nlished in the DIALOG trial [22]. The scale contains 11\nitems asking patients to rate their satisfaction with 8 life\ndomains and 3 treatment aspects, one of which is medica-\ntion, on a scale ranging from 1 (lowest satisfaction) to 7\n(highest satisfaction).\nf) Continuation with financial incentives (in intervention\ngroup only) and adherence during a 6 month follow up\nperiod will be taken from the medical records.\ng) Teams in the intervention group will be asked after 6\nmonths, 12 months and 18 months about all aspects of\nexperiences with the scheme including whether patients\non the scheme asked for an increase of the incentive, and\nwhether other patients with hitherto good adherence also\nasked for financial incentives and\/or became poorly\nadherent in order to be eligible for the incentives. This will\nbe done using open questions with a written documenta-\ntion of the answers.\nSimple measures of subjective quality of life and satisfac-\ntion with medication are the only patient reported out-\ncome criteria used in the study. They have been included\nto obtain a subjective outcome that reflects the user per-\nspective. However, this will be an element that patients\ncan participate in or not. If they do not consent to be con-\ntacted for completing the scale at the end of the interven-\ntion period, they will still participate in the trial, and there\nare no mandatory patient rated or interview based criteria.\nThe patients to be recruited for the trial have been 'diffi-\ncult to engage' in care, and many may refuse participating\nbecause they do not want to be interviewed by a\nresearcher or complete questionnaires. This would result\nin difficulties to recruit and - more importantly - a signifi-\ncant selection bias.\nRisks and anticipated benefits for trial participants and \nsociety including how benefits justify risks\nThere are potential risks linked to offering financial incen-\ntives for patients in the intervention group. These include\nthat patients a) become financially dependent on the\nincentive, b) demand more money over time, c) will not\nwant to terminate the scheme although they might be pre-\npared to adhere to medication even without the incentive,\nand d) spend the additional income on illegal drugs. Also,\nother patients who have been adherent so far might ask to\nbe offered financial incentives as well and\/or decrease\ntheir adherence to become eligible. Based on 5 years expe-\nrience with the intervention in the AOT in the East Lon-\ndon Borough of Newham, one can expect most of these\nrisks to be limited. No patient with good adherence has\never asked to receive financial incentives as well (and to\nour knowledge none has ever become poorly adherent in\norder to be eligible for the scheme). One patient receiving\nthe intervention has once asked for the money to be\nincreased which was declined without any negative conse-\nquences. The financial dependence is difficult to judge,\nbut the maximum overall amount of \u00a360 per 4 week\nperiod is rather small to induce dependence. We cannot\nguarantee whether patients spend the additional income\non illegal drugs, but all patients have civil rights and the\ncapacity to decide on what they want to spend their\nmoney and, on a practical level, the amount of incentives\nis not sufficient to fund a significant use of illegal drugs.\nThe anticipated benefits for the patient include a much\nbetter quality of life with reduced distress, lower suicide\nrisk, fewer problems with the justice system, lower rate of\ncompulsory treatment and less time spent in psychiatric\nin-patient units. Some patients may see the benefit of the\nmedication, change their attitude towards it and later take\nit without financial incentives [23].\nThe potential benefits to society include a reduced risk of\npatients to harm others and much lower costs in terms of\ninput of health services and other services in the society\nincluding the police and the justice system.\nFor patients in the control group there are no discernible\nrisks or benefits. They will only be asked whether they\nconsent to their data being used for research and would\nconsider in principle an offer of financial incentives to\ntake their medication. Their care will not be altered at all.\nFor patients in either group there are a maximum of\neleven satisfaction ratings on one scale, but no potentially\ndistressing interviews or assessments. In the interventionPage 5 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Psychiatry 2009, 9:61 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-244X\/9\/61group, patients get offered financial incentives, but can\nrefuse further financial incentives and medication itself at\nany point of time.\nTrial Steering Committee and Data Monitoring \nCommittee\nA trial steering committee (TSC) will be established with\nan independent chair, a user representative, and at least\ntwo further independent experts.\nAlthough the amount of data collection is limited in the\ntrial, we will also establish a Data Monitoring and Ethics\nCommittee (DMEC) because of the ethically sensitive\nnature of the intervention. The DMEC will be independ-\nent of the applicants and report to the TSC. It is suggested\nto have a joint TSC\/DMEC meeting at the beginning of the\nstudy, and subsequently arrange DMEC meetings before\nthe TSC meetings. The meetings of both groups will be\nscheduled for times immediately following the expected\ndelivery of major milestones, i.e. in month 6, 12 and 25\nof the study\nEthical approval\nThe study has been approved by Ealing and West London\nResearch Ethics Committee (REC reference number: 09\/\nH0710\/35). All data will be anonymised and stored\nsecurely in line with the Data Protection Act. No pub-\nlished data will contain patient identifiable information.\nStatistical analysis\nFor analysis, we will use generalized linear models as\nappropriate to the outcome, with random effects for\ngroups, and sensitivity analyses to explore the impact for\nmissing data. A detailed Statistical Analysis Plan will be\nagreed by the TSC prior to analysis of un-blinded data.\nEconomic analysis\nA cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted from an\nNHS perspective, using data on health service use,\nnational unit cost figures and the main outcomes in turn\n(adherence, time 'slippage' of taking depots, CGI). Incre-\nmental cost-effectiveness ratios and cost-effectiveness\nacceptability curves will be estimated and employed as\nnecessary, generated from the net benefit approach and\nusing bootstrap regression for a range of values of willing-\nness to pay for incremental outcome changes. Sensitivity\nanalyses will examine the impact of altering key assump-\ntions and parameter values. It is usual in any trial to find\ndifferences in service access, treatment adherence, base-\nline characteristics, changes in outcome dimensions over\ntime, cost and cost-effectiveness. In the present study,\nthese variations would be of particular interest, and we\ntherefore plan to analyse patterns within the samples in\norder to examine whether there are identifiable patterns of\ninequity with respect to need, socioeconomic group, and\nkey demographic characteristics. The concentration index\napproach, now quite widely used in health economics for\nexample, offers a robust and informative methodology\n[24].\nProposed sample size\nWe will recruit 34 AOTs in England (initially 36 to allow\nfor two teams to drop out between recruitment and begin-\nning of trial), and 4 patients within each team. Seventeen\nteams each will be randomly allocated to the experimen-\ntal group and the control intervention, i.e. 'treatment as\nusual'. We aim to have 68 patients in each arm of the trial,\nallowing for one patient per team to be lost between\nrecruitment and one year follow up. This estimate of a loss\nof one patient per team may be rather pessimistic, but\nenables us to have a minimum of 52 patients per arm\n(assuming that in at least one team per arm there will be\nno loss to follow up) included in the intention-to-treat\nanalysis. Dropping out of the study and the intention-to-\ntreat analysis will occur only because of a) death, b) long-\nterm imprisonment, c) long-term hospitalisation, d)\nunknown whereabouts with no chance to obtain outcome\ndata, or e) withdrawal of consent for the data to be used\nfor research. Patients in the intervention group may dis-\ncontinue with the intervention within the one year study\nperiod, because their clinicians think that maintenance\nmedication is not appropriate anymore or patients them-\nselves decide to come off the scheme. Such patients will\nstill be included in the intention to treat analysis, and dis-\ncontinuing with the scheme will not compromise the\navailability of outcome data. Refer to Figure 1. CONSORT\nFlow Diagram for details.\nAccording to the definition of good adherence as taking at\nleast 80% of prescribed medication, the study is powered\nto detect a difference in adherence from 25% in the TAU\narm to 65% in the experimental arm with 90% power for\n5% significance. To convert this to a continuous measure\nrequires an estimate of the standard deviation of the per-\ncentage of medication taken: Remington et al 2007 [20]\nestimate this as 31%. This estimate may appear high,\nwhich makes our power calculation rather conservative.\nAssuming the 31% standard deviation pertains to both\narms, the original assumptions are then equivalent to\nassumed means of 60% of prescribed medicine on TAU,\nand 92% on treatment. In fact, the mean in Remington et\nal [20] was 66%, so the revised sample size calculations\non the continuous measure are powered for a more mod-\nest increase from 65% to 85% (an absolute difference of\n20%). This would require 47 per group in an individually\nrandomised study. This then has to be inflated to allow for\nclustering. Assuming an ICC of 0.05 and an average of 3\npatients per team gives an inflation factor of 1.1 [25] or 52Page 6 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Psychiatry 2009, 9:61 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-244X\/9\/61\nPage 7 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nThis figure displays the CONSORT Flow DiagramFigure 1\nThis figure displays the CONSORT Flow Diagram.\nExcluded\n64 AOTs not consenting to \nparticipate or already using \nfinancial incentives \nAllocated to intervention: M4M \n17 AOTs, 68 participants\naverage cluster size = 4 \nApproached for  par ticipation:\n100 Assertive Outreach Teams (AOTs) \nEnrollment Teams \n36 AOTs \nAllocated to control condition \n17 AOTs, 68 participants\naverage cluster size = 4 \nRandomisation at cluster  level:  \n34 AOTs with 4 patients each \nAssessed for  eligibility and potentially \napproached for  recruitment:\nca. 240 patients to achieve recruitment \nof 4 patients per AOT \nExcluded\nCa. 96 participants who  \ncannot be contacted, do not meet \ninclusion criteria or do not \nprovide informed consent \nDrop out    \n2 AOTs with 4 patients each, \nwithdrawing consent to \nparticipate \nRecruited to study:\n144 Participants \u2013 4 patients per AOT \n        Allocation\nLost to one year  follow-up: \n 0 AOT \n16 participants  \nPossible reasons of individual \nloss to follow up:     \nLong term hospitalisation \nLong term imprisonment \nCommunity treatment order \nUnknown whereabouts \nWithdrawal of consent \nDeath\nLost to one year  follow-up: \n 0 AOT \n16 participants  \nPossible reasons of individual \nloss to follow up:     \nLong term hospitalisation \nLong term imprisonment \nCommunity treatment order \nUnknown whereabouts \nWithdrawal of consent \nDeath\nOne year  follow-up \nClusters analysed: \n17 AOTs \nPar ticipants analysed:  \n52 patients \nClusters analysed: \n17 AOTs \nPar ticipants analysed:  \n52 patients \nAnalysis \n25\nBMC Psychiatry 2009, 9:61 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-244X\/9\/61per group. We will therefore aim to have one year follow\nup data from at least 3 patients each from 17 teams per\narm (and for 4 patients in one team in each arm). To allow\nfor potential dropout we will actually recruit 4 per team.\nWe do not propose a correction for variable group size.\nThe numbers recruited per team are under our control and\nthe loss to follow-up rate is likely to be low with small dif-\nferences between teams. Thus, the coefficient of variation\nof the group sizes is unlikely to exceed 23% [26].\nDiscussion\nThe trial aims to establish the effectiveness and cost effec-\ntiveness of offering financial incentives to improve adher-\nence to antipsychotic maintenance medication. The target\ngroup are patients with psychotic disorders who do not\nadhere to medication, although they are likely to benefit\nfrom it. The primary outcome is adherence to medication.\nWe assume that an improved adherence to medication\nwill be associated with significant health and social gains\nfor the patients concerned. However, the aim of this trial\nis only to test an intervention to improve adherence and\nnot whether antipsychotic maintenance medication is\nindeed effective or not. We therefore decided to use health\nand social outcomes only as secondary criteria, although\nimproving them is the ultimate objective of the whole\nintervention.\nIt would also have been desirable to have patient reported\nmeasures, e.g. on their attitude to treatment in general and\nto medication in particular, as a central outcome. How-\never, the target group of this study are very difficult to\nengage in care and often even more difficult to engage in\nresearch trials. Requiring patients to attend interviews or\nfill in questionnaires may have limited recruitment and\nlead to substantial drop out rates. Thus, the ideal research\ndesign cannot be implemented because patients are likely\nnot to comply.\nWe plan to conduct the study with and in AOTs. Yet, given\nthe possible organisational changes in the NHS which can\nbe difficult to anticipate, we may have to deal with teams\nthat are re-configured during the duration of the trial. The\nresearch team will try and implement the study protocol\ndespite such changes. We will aim to ensure that the allo-\ncation of patients to teams in the experimental arm or\ncontrol group throughout the study period is not compro-\nmised. This may be a challenge since the research team\nhas no managerial or clinical control over the participat-\ning clinical teams. We will also aim to assess the general\nexperiences of teams with the practice, e.g. whether other\nhitherto adherent patients also asked for financial incen-\ntives and whether teams continue with offering financial\nincentives to the study patients after the end of the trial.\nThese general experiences may be highly relevant for a\npotential wider implementation of the intervention.\nIf the trial shows that offering financial incentives is effec-\ntive and cost-effective, it may be recommended as an\noption in the treatment of patients with psychotic disor-\nders who are non-adherent to medication. The measure is\nnot coercive and requires patients to have full capacity to\nmake the decision to both taking the medication and\naccepting a financial incentive. There is no reliable data on\nthe exact size of that group of patients. One may estimate\nthat between 1000 and a maximum of 5000 patients in\nthe UK may fall into this category at one point of time.\nHowever, the implications of a positive finding may go\nbeyond the UK and also affect treatment of similar\npatients in other countries.\nList of abbreviations used\nAOT: Assertive Outreach Team; CMHT: Community Men-\ntal Health Team; DMEC: Data Monitoring and Ethics\nCommittee; FIAT: Financial Incentives (for) Adherence\nTrial; ICC: Intracluster Correlation Coefficient; NHS:\nNational Health Service; TAU: Treatment As Usual; TSC:\nTrial Steering Committee.\nCompeting interests\nSP is principal investigator (and RA and MF are co-inves-\ntigators) on a qualitative study on ethical concerns related\nto the use of financial incentives to improve adherence to\nantipsychotic maintenance medication in patients with\npoor adherence (funded by the Wellcome Trust.
