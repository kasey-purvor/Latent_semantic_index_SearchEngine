For all diagnostic groups identified, first-ever patients were found to be less costly to\nsupport than longer-term patients, even after adjustment for various factors, including whether\npatients were single consulters. When multivariate analyses were employed, between 20% and 69%\nof the cost variation for first-ever patients could be explained by patient and other characteristics,\nand the effect of the contact (first or subsequent) variable was reduced.\nConclusion. This study considered only the costs to the specialist psychiatric services but the\nmethodology allows the likely annual resource implications of supporting new patients to be\npredicted from data collected at first contact. Such information can help ensure that services are\nadequately funded and that the resources are deployed appropriately between client groups.\nINTRODUCTION\nIn most Western countries the focus of psy-\nchiatric care is moving from psychiatric hospitals\nto community-based services. Community-based\npsychiatric care can be defined as a highly\ndifferentiated system of care devoted to a defined\npopulation, comprising a wide spectrum of\nfacilities, including out-patient and day-patient\nservices, general hospital psychiatric wards, and\nresidential services away from the hospital. A\n\" Address for correspondence: Dr Francesco Amaddeo, Servizio\ndi Psicologia Medica, Istituto di Psichiatria, Ospedale Policlinico,\n37134 Verona, Italy.\ngood mental health system should ensure early\ndiagnosis, prompt treatment in response to\nemergencies, and close liaison with other health\nand social services (Tansella, 1991).\nThe pros and cons of community psychiatric\ncare have been widely discussed in the literature\n(Hoult, 1986; Kiesler & Sibulkin, 1987; Lamb,\n1993). The results of randomized controlled\ntrials, conducted to compare the outcomes of\ntreatment in hospital-based and community-\nbased services, can be synthesized as follows:\nwhen considering either clinical or social out-\ncome, community-based services are as effective\nas hospital-based services and provide easier\naccess to care, decrease the number of hospital\n173\n174 F. Amaddeo and others\ndays and promote greater satisfaction in patients\nand relatives (Fenton et al. 1979; Stein & Test,\n1980; Test & Stein, 1980; Weisbrod et al. 1980;\nHoult et al. 1983; Muijen et al. 1992a, b ; Burns\net al. 1993; Dean et al. 1993; Marks et al. 1994;\nLeff, 1997). Burns & Santos (1995) reviewed the\nliterature on randomized clinical trials of inter-\nventions using treatment principles and practices\nconsistent with the Program for Assertive Com-\nmunity Treatment (PACT) model, and reached\nsimilar conclusions. More recently, community-\nbased services were found to provide better\ncontinuity of care to patients resident in their\ncatchment area when compared to traditional\nservices based in hospital (Goldberg et al. 1996;\nSytema et al. 1997).\nStudies that have compared costs of treatment\nby hospital and community services have shown\nthat the latter can be cost-effective alternatives\nto the former (Burns et al. 1993; McCrone et al.\n1994; Knapp et al. 1994, 1997; Quinlivan et al.\n1995; Goldberg et al. 1996; Merson et al. 1996;\nBeecham et al. 1997). Other studies attempted to\nidentify the variables that predict higher or\nlower costs (Knapp et al. 1995; Salize & Ro$ ssler,\n1996; Knapp, 1997). One of the main variables\naccounting for differences in costs between\npatients is previous psychiatric history: patients\nwith a longer history of illness have higher costs\n(Beecham et al. 1997). In areas where a shift has\ntaken place from a hospital-based to a com-\nmunity-based system of psychiatric care it is\nimportant for policy, planning and management,\nas well as for clinical work, to evaluate the costs\nof treating new patients.\nTo our knowledge no studies to date have\nanalysed the costs of first-ever patients. Thus,\nthe first aim of this paper is to provide\npreliminary, descriptive information on which\nservices these patients use in the first year after\ntheir initial contact, with what associated costs,\nand how these costs relate to diagnosis and\npersonal characteristics. If there is a difference\nbetween first-ever and longer-term patients, a\nmore accurate prediction of future resource\nrequirements for psychiatric services that are\nfully community-based, or moving in that\ndirection, could be generated for periods beyond\n1 year.\nCase register research has concentrated so far\non the analyses of inception and prevalence\nrates over time and on comparing patterns of\ncare over different periods of time within the\nsame area as well as between different areas. For\nmaking these comparisons, indicators such as\nthe number of in-patient admissions, day-\nhospital or day-centre attendances, or out-\npatient contacts have been used. The second aim\nof this paper is to propose an additional indicator\nfor case register studies on patterns of care: a\nsingle economic index of costs that summarizes\nthe complex information on the amount of\ndirect care received by first-ever and longer-term\npatients over a specified period of time.\nThe epidemiologically-based research de-\nscribed in this paper concentrated on all first-\never patients in contact with psychiatric services\nof South-Verona over a 2-year period. Four\nspecific hypotheses were tested: (1) it is feasible\nto add unit cost measures to case register data in\norder to describe the cost implications of\ntreatment and to calculate a cost index which\nsummarizes all information on the amount of\ncare received over a specified period; (2) the\ncosts of care and treatment for first-ever patients\nare lower than the corresponding costs for\nlonger-term patients ; (3) the costs of treatment\nof first-ever patients vary between individuals in\nresponse to patient characteristics, including\ndiagnostic group, age, gender, education, marital\nstatus, accommodation, employment status and\nreferral source; (4) the direct costs of mental\nhealth care for patients in the year after their\nfirst-ever contact can be predicted from patient\ndata collected at the point of first contact.\nMETHOD\nThe psychiatric services\nThe South-Verona area includes part of Verona\n(a city of about 260000 inhabitants in the\nVeneto region in North-East Italy) and two\nneighbouring small towns (Castel d\u2019Azzano and\nButtapietra). South-Verona is a mainly urban\narea (population density 988}km#) with a pre-\ndominance of service and manufacturing in-\ndustries.\nThe South-Verona Community Psychiatric\nService (CPS), is run by the Institute of\nPsychiatry, University of Verona, and is the\nmain provider of psychiatric care for the adult\npopulation. The CPS offers a range of well-\nCosts of community-based psychiatric care 175\nintegrated hospital and community services,\nincluding a 15-bed in-patient ward at the\nUniversity General Hospital, a Community\nMental Health Centre (CMHC) providing day-\ncare and rehabilitation, out-patient departments,\nscheduled domiciliary visits, a liaison service for\npsychiatric and psychological consultations for\nother departments of the General Hospital, a\n24-hour accident and emergency department, a\n24-hour staffed hostel, and sheltered apartments.\nThe South-Verona CPS is divided into three\nmulti-disciplinary teams, each serving a sub-\nsector of the catchment area.\nWith the exception of hospital nurses, all staff\n(psychiatrists, psychologists, community nurses,\nsocial workers, etc.) work both inside and\noutside hospital ensuring continuity of care\nthrough different phases of treatment and the\ndifferent components of the service (Tansella,\n1991). Close integration between hospital and\ncommunity components allows early discharge\nfrom hospital and is associated with a shorter\nlength of stay (Amaddeo et al. 1995a ; Gater et\nal. 1995). In addition to the South-Verona CPS,\npsychiatric care may be provided to South-\nVerona residents in two private inpatient units\n(with a total of 220 beds), an out-patient\naddiction service and a few general hospital\nneurological wards. In accordance with the\nItalian psychiatric reform there have been no\nnew admissions to the state psychiatric hospitals\nsince 1978, and no admissions at all to those\ninstitutions since January 1982. The hospitals\ncontinue to provide care for only a few very old\nlong-stay patients : there were eleven such people\nfrom South-Verona on 31 December 1994.\nThe psychiatric case register\nThe South-Verona PCR started on 31 December\n1978 with a prevalence count and has been\noperating ever since. At first contact with the\npsychiatric service, sociodemographic inform-\nation, past psychiatric and medical history, and\nclinical data are routinely collected for people\naged 14 years and over. Contacts with psychi-\natrists, psychologists, social workers and psy-\nchiatric nurses are recorded. Each attendance at\nan out-patient clinic and each domiciliary visit is\ncounted as a contact. The time spent for out-\npatient and domiciliary visits is routinely re-\ncorded but not linked to named staff members,\nthus minimizing the possibility that time spent\nwith patients would be over-estimated. Each\nextramural contact is recorded as \u2018planned\u2019 or\n\u2018unplanned\u2019, according to whether or not an\nappointment was previously arranged.\nDiagnoses are assigned according to ICD-10\n(ICD-9 until 1991) and are routinely reviewed\nby the director of the case register (Professor\nM. Tansella). Diagnosis and sociodemographic\ndata may be updated at successive contacts, if\nnecessary. All psychiatric services in South-\nVerona and the larger province of Verona\nprovide data for South-Verona residents. Psy-\nchiatrists and psychologists in private practice\nand general practitioners (GPs) do not report to\nthe register.\nPatients\nAll patients who had at least one contact between\n1 January 1992 and 31 December 1993 with\nservices which report to the psychiatric case\nregister and received an ICD diagnosis were\nincluded in this study, some of whom were first-\nepisode cases (people for whom this was their\nfirst life-time psychiatric contact). Patients with\na diagnosis of drug dependence were excluded as\nthey are cared for by an independent specialist\nservice outside psychiatric system. The costs of\ncare provided in the 365 days following the\nindex contact were assessed for first-ever patients\n(N\u00af 299) and for 768 longer-term patients.\nFor the purposes of the present study, ICD\ndiagnoses were collapsed into four diagnostic\ngroups: affective disorders (ICD-10 codes F30\nthrough F33; F34.1, .8, .9, F38; F39; F41.2;\nF43.20, .21, .22), neurotic and somatoform\ndisorders (ICD-10 codes F40; F41.0, .1, .3, .8,\n.9 ; F42; F44; F45; F48; F54), schizophrenia and\nrelated disorders (ICD-10 codes F20 through\nF29; F84), other diagnoses (including organic\npsychoses, alcohol dependence, disorders of\nadult personality and behaviour, etc.).\nUnit costs\nCosts were attached to each service recorded on\nthe PCR so as to give the best local estimates a\nlong-run marginal opportunity costs (Amaddeo\net al. 1995b ; 1997). This is the appropriate base\nfor economic evaluations of this kind, and\nensures that both capital and running costs are\nincluded, and that the long-term resource conse-\nquences of any changes to service utilization\npatterns are explicitly identified and measured\n176 F. Amaddeo and others\n(Beecham, 1995). The costs of GPs, other\nmedical care, private psychiatrists and psycholo-\ngists, medication payments by patients, and all\nindirect costs were excluded from this study\nbecause data on the use of these services were\nnot available from the PCR. Costs are expressed\nin lire at 1993 price levels.\nThe costs of support and treatment provided\nby the South-Verona CPS were estimated by\ndividing the total expenditure in 1993 for each\nservice component by the number of items of\ncare in the same year ; and included the costs of\npersonnel (including time spent in clinical or\nplanning meetings), administration, medication,\nexaminations and accommodation (including\ncapital costs). The cost of out-patient contacts\nwas calculated taking into account the total cost\nof a working minute for the different profes-\nsionals (psychiatrists, psychologists, social work-\ners, nurses, etc.) and multiplying this value by\nthe estimated time spent in each contact. For the\nin-patient services the cost per daywas calculated\nand for the rehabilitation groups and the day-\nhospital a cost per contact was estimated. The\ncosts of private in-patient clinics were based on\nthe prices paid by the Italian National Health\nService. The support and treatment services\nlisted here are mainly delivered, coordinated,\nand funded by the public sector health service.\nCosts per year\nThe total 1-year cost per patient was calculated\nusing PCR data, the unit cost list and a bespoke\nsoftware package, linked to the case register and\ndesigned in Verona by our research group\n(Amaddeo et al. 1997). For each patient, costs\nwere grouped by service type: in-patient costs,\nincluded all days spent in a public or private\nsector hospital for psychiatric care; sheltered\naccommodation costs, included all days spent in\npublic sector specialized accommodation; day-\npatient costs, included all contacts at day-\nhospitals or at the rehabilitation groups; out-\npatient costs, included all contacts at the out-\npatient department, the community psychiatric\nclinics, the accident and emergency department\nand for general hospital liaison; and community\ncosts, included visits made to patients\u2019 or\nrelatives\u2019 homes, visits to patients temporarily\nsupported by other agencies, or visits by clinical\nstaff to voluntary organizations or social services\npremises.\nHypothesis testing\nAll statistical analyses were conducted at the\nlevel of the individual patient. Chi-square tests\nwere used to test the significance of association\nbetween sample and demographic charac-\nteristics. Analyses of variance were conducted,\ntesting for cost differences by diagnosis (affective\ndisorders ; neurotic and somatoform disorders ;\nschizophrenia and related disorders ; other diag-\nnoses), gender, age (14\u201324; 25\u201344; 45\u201364; & 65),\nmarital status, accommodation, educational at-\ntainment, employment status, job status, referral\nsource, characteristics of the first contact with\npsychiatric services (planned or unplanned cases)\nand single or multiple consultation cases.\nMultiple regression analyses were conducted to\ntest for associations between yearly costs and\nthese patient characteristics. Separate equations\nwere estimated using ordinary least squares\nregression for each of the four diagnostic groups,\ntaking the logarithms of total costs as dependent\nvariables (because of non-normality of residuals,\nand hence mispecifications of the equations\nwithout the transformation). The final version\nof each equation was selected on the con-\nventional criteria of parsimony, statistical signifi-\ncance interpretability.\nRESULTS\nIn 1992, 137 first-ever South-Verona patients\ncontacted the services reporting to the South-\nVerona PCR (2\u00b109 per 1000 adult inhabitants).\nIn 1993, the figure rose to 162 (2\u00b146 per 1000).\nThey represent 19% and 18% of the total 1-year\nprevalence in 1992 and 1993 respectively. (In the\ncalculation of yearly prevalence rates people\nwith a diagnosis of drug dependence were\nexcluded.)\nFirst-ever and longer-term patients\nThe total and component costs of 1 year\u2019s\ntreatment for first-ever and longer-term patients\nare summarized in Table 1, distinguishing the\nfour diagnostic groups. For all four diagnostic\ngroups, the total costs of treatment for longer-\nterm patients are higher than for treatment of\nthose with first life-time contact (P\u00af 0\u00b1031 for\npeople with schizophrenia and related disorders,\nP! 0\u00b1001 for the other three groups).

They are more\nlikely to be under 25 years of age, and less likely\nto be aged 45 to 64. It should be noted that the\nanalyses found no significant differences between\nthe cases whose first-ever contact was recorded\nin 1992 or 1993, except for accommodation\nwhere a very much higher proportion of the\n1993 patients were living with relatives or in\ncommunal accommodation.\nA further series of ANOVAs were performed\nto explore whether the treatment costs of first-\never patients vary between individuals in re-\nsponse to their characteristics (Table 4). There\nwere no significant differences in total costs by\nany of the demographic characteristics recorded\non the PCR; gender, age, marital status,\naccommodation type, educational attainment,\nemployment status and job status. The costs of\npatients with an unplanned first-ever contact\nwere significantly higher than the costs of those\npatients who made an appointment before their\ninitial contact. The results of the multivariate\nanalyses which examine these potential associ-\nations simultaneously are reported below.\nCost predictions\nFour series of regression equations were esti-\nmated for first-ever patients only, separating the\ndiagnostic groups. A single equation across all\nfour diagnostic groups was also fitted but\nperformed much less well statistically than these\nseparate equations. The estimation procedure,\ndescribed above, produced the \u2018final \u2019 equations\nsummarized in Table 5.\nThe first thing to notice from Table 5 is the\nvery reasonable degree of statistical fit obtained\nby each of the first-ever case analyses (not-\nwithstanding the small sample size for the\nschizophrenia diagnostic group) : between 20%\n180 F. Amaddeo and others\nand 69% of the observed inter-patient costs\nvariations is \u2018explained\u2019 statistically by the\nincluded patient characteristics and the referral\nsource.\nThese results suggest a number of inter-\nrelationships. Older patients with neurotic and\nsomatoform disorders or with affective dis-\norders, cost less, but there are no other age\neffects. There are gender differences, males with\naffective disorders and single males with neurosis\ncosting more than females. Marital status has\nlittle effect, except that single patients, with a\ndiagnosis of schizophrenia, are more costly than\nothers, as are single males with neurosis. The\nlevel of education attained also has a positive\neffect on costs, but only for people with affective\ndisorders (those with primary education cost\nmore) and with schizophrenia (those with sec-\nondary education cost more). Unemployed\npeople with neurotic and somatoform disorders\nare more costly, yet if they are male, being\nunemployed reduces cost. As far as the referral\nsource is concerned, significant effects were\nfound only in two groups: among patients with\naffective disorders (those referred by doctors\nfrom medical and surgical department were less\ncostly) and among neurotic patients (those\nreferred by relatives were mostly costly).\nFinally, cost differences were tested by type of\nfirst ever contact (planned or unplanned). Using\nthe bivariate analysis, the mean cost for un-\nplanned contacts was found to be nearly twice\nthat for planned contacts (P\u00af 0\u00b1018, see Table\n4). However, the findings from the multivariate\nanalyses, which are more reliable and more\nrelevant, showed no cost differences between\nplanned and unplanned cases, except for people\nin the \u2018other diagnoses \u2019 group, where those\npatients whose first contact was unplanned cost,\non average, 1\u00b11 million lire more per annum\n(P\u00af 0\u00b1005) than planned cases.\nDISCUSSION\nIn many countries today, as in Italy, it is\nincreasingly being recognized that information\non the costs of care can help to achieve a more\ncost-effective deployment of scarce resources\n(Amaddeo et al. 1995b ; Knapp, 1995a, b ;\nPercudani et al. 1995; Gray et al. 1997).\nImproving the cost-effectiveness of a health care\nsystem means that available resources can serve\na larger number of people and}or improve the\nquantity and quality of care for individual\npatients.\nThe present study has concentrated on sub-\njects who contacted a psychiatric service for the\nfirst time in their lives, a group of patients about\nwhom no cost studies appear to have been\npublished so far and little is known, particularly\nin relation to service utilization. Scanning the\nliterature of the last 5 years we have been able to\nidentify only one large sample study on service\nuse by first-ever patients. Tansella et al. (1995)\nused case register data to study the care episodes\nof 1423 first-ever psychiatric patients. The\nsurvival analyses showed that the duration of\ncare episodes increased consistently from the\nfirst to the fifth episodes, and that the probability\nof opening a new episode of care after the first\nincreased consistently from the second to the\nsixth episode. More recently, patterns of care\nover 2 years for a cohort of 1056 first-ever\npatients have been evaluated (Tansella & Mic-\nciolo, 1998).\nThe use of a case register for calculating costs\nA unit cost list was developed and used to\ncalculate the direct costs of all patients in contact\nwith psychiatric services reporting to the South-\nVerona PCR in the years 1992\u20131993. Although\nthe unit costs for each service need to be\ncalculated carefully, and this can be quite time-\nconsuming, it is clear that PCR data can be\nsupplemented with cost indicators with which\nthe financial implications of the varying service\nutilization patterns can be calculated. The\nsoftware prepared for the South-Verona case\nregister facilitates the aggregation of costs data\nby type of treatment or for different groups of\npatients, making routinely collected data more\nuseful to planners and practitioners. Cost studies\nshould, of course, be repeated periodically to\nreflect the evolution of psychiatric care but the\ndevelopmental work described above shows that\nthe first hypothesis can be accepted. Local case\nregisters are increasingly being used to monitor\nthe psychiatric care provided by different, often\noverlapping, services to residents in a geo-\ngraphically defined area. The approach de-\nscribed in this paper is an efficient and powerful\nmethod for assessing the cost of psychiatric care\nfor large numbers of patients. It also provides a\nsingle economic index which summarizes the\nCosts of community-based psychiatric care 181\ncomplex information on the amount of care\nreceived over a specified period of time, which\ncan usefully supplement other descriptive indices\nof service use.\nComparing costs of first-ever and longer-term\npatients\nThe results of the present study show that first-\never patients, in the first year after the index\ncontact, were significantly less costly than the\nlonger-term patients in contact with the same\nservices during the same period of time. Closer\nexamination of the first ever patients revealed\nthat 34% were \u2018single consulters \u2019, that is they\nwere seen only once in the 365-day period. This\npercentage is similar to that found in previous\nstudies (43% in the 1-year follow-up study by\nTansella & Micciolo, 1998; and a very similar\nproportion in the study by Tansella et al. 1995,\nreferring to all first-ever patients seen the years\n1982\u20131991). Many \u2018single consulters \u2019 were re-\nferred to the CPS by general practitioners (GPs)\nfor screening and assessment and then referred\nback to GPs. The percentage of single consulters\namong longer-term patients was only 14%.\nHowever, after adjusting for the different pro-\nportions of single consulters there are still\nsignificant cost differences between first-ever\nand other patients.\nThe cost difference is confirmed for all\ndiagnostic groups identified in our research.\nHowever, when total costs are disaggregated in\ntheir component parts (in-patient care or day-\npatient care, for example) the difference is no\nlonger significant for in-patient and community\ncare for patients with a diagnosis of schizo-\nphrenia, for day-patient care of patients with a\ndiagnosis of neurotic and somatoform disorders,\nor for out-patient care in all four diagnostic\ngroups.\nThe second hypothesis was therefore con-\nfirmed in all diagnostic groups for the total costs\nof psychiatric support as well as for the costs of\nday care and community care. The result for in-\npatient care in the subgroup of patients with a\ndiagnosis of schizophrenia and related disorders\n(no significant cost difference) is not surprising.\nIn South-Verona these patients are promptly\nadmitted to hospital as needed, at the beginning\nof their illness as well as later on and patients are\nsupported by the same team inside and outside\nhospital. Such continuity of care is particularly\nadvantageous for the most severely disabled and\ndisturbed patients and has been shown to result\nin shorter in-patient stays for patients known to\nthe service (Gater et al. 1995).\nSimilar amounts of out-patient care were\nrequired by longer-term and first-ever patients,\nbut more (and more expensive) day care and\ncommunity care (which includes home visits by\nall team members including psychiatrists) were\nused by the patients already known to the CPS.\nThese data could be seen as being consistent\nwith the experience of clinical practice. For\npatients with a previous psychiatric history, not\nonly out-patient care, but all components of a\ncommunity-based system of care are important ;\ndomiciliary visits, day-care and rehabilitation\nprogrammes are key service delivery modes. One\nimplication of these results for service organ-\nisation is that resources should be dedicated to\nensure sufficient provision of these types of care,\nalongside services provided in more traditional\nout-patient departments.\nOur data also show that in the specialist\npublic sector services, there are cost differences\nbetween the diagnoses, although diagnosis alone\nis a rather limited cost predictor. Costs are\nhighest for patients with schizophrenia and\nrelated disorders and lowest for those with\nneurotic and somatoform disorders. This latter\ngroup are more likely to receive care from\nprivate psychiatrists and psychologists who do\nnot report to the case register.\nThe predictive power of individual\ncharacteristics\nThe results of the bivariate analyses showed that\nno significant differences in cost were found by\nany of the demographic characteristics recorded\non the PCR. However, these analyses ignore the\nmore complex interrelationships which might\noccur between the variables. Differences do exist\nand they do have an impact on costs : hypothesis\nthree was confirmed when multivariate analyses\nwere conducted.\nAmong the many challenges of implementing\na policy of community-based care is the pre-\ndiction of service use (and, to some extent, of\nservice needs) and the associated cost conse-\nquences. The costs of community mental health\ncare will rarely be identical for different patients,\nso that the prediction of resource requirements\nfor individual people is useful for service\n182 F. Amaddeo and others\nplanners, budget holders, purchasers and pro-\nviders.\nBetween 20% and 69% of the observed inter-\npatient cost variation can be obtained stat-\nistically by the individual characteristics included\nin the cost functions reported above. The lowest\npercentage of the variance explained was found\nin the \u2018other diagnoses \u2019 group, which includes\npatients with a miscellany of diagnoses. The\nproportion of variance explained by individual\ncharacteristics in the more homogeneous groups,\nfor example schizophrenia and related disorders,\nis higher.\nAmong patients who contacted the specialist\npsychiatric service for the first time in their lives,\na number of variables were shown to be\nassociated with costs : age; gender; marital\nstatus ; unemployment; and referral source.\nWhile the effects of age and gender are difficult\nto explain and are probably related to ac-\ncessibility of services, distance from home, etc.,\nthose of marital status and unemployment\nsuggest that people who do not receive support\nfrom partners or within a work environment\nneed more support and care from community-\nbased public services. Where such services do\nnot exist or are insufficiently developed a greater\npart of the cost burden would fall to patients\nand their families or needs would remain unmet.\nWe would, therefore, have expected more signifi-\ncant effects to have come from the variable\nindicating that people lived alone as the formal\nservices compensate for the reduced availability\nof care from family members or friends.\nThose patients with affective disorders re-\nferred by non-psychiatric specialists had lower\ncosts in the year following their first-ever visit.\nAgain, a direct link can be made with CPS\nworking practices. Most of these patients are\nreferred by the general hospital liaison psy-\nchiatric service. After a few out-patient visits,\ngeneral practitioners continue their care and\ntreatment. The finding that neurotic patients\nreferred by relatives were more costly is difficult\nto interpret. One possibility is that these patients\nrepresent a selected group of people, highly\nmotivated to remain in continuous psychiatric\ncare.\nPrevious analyses of the PCR (Tansella &\nMicciolo, 1998) showed that patients with a\nfirst-ever unplanned contact used considerably\nmore community care services and in-patient\ncare when compared to other patients on the\nregister. The bivariate analyses undertaken in\nthe current study appeared to confirm this\nfinding with higher yearly costs for those people\nwhose index contact was unplanned. However,\nwhen multivariate analyses were performed,\nhigher costs were confirmed only in the mixed\n\u2018other diagnoses \u2019 group. The need to use\nmultivariate statistical methods in this field of\nresearch to tease out the interrelationships\nbetween influencing factors is again confirmed\n(Beecham et al. 1991; Knapp, 1997).\nThe fourth hypothesis can be accepted: it is\npossible to explain statistically some of the cost\nvariations between new patients by reference to\ndifferences in patient characteristics, using in-\nformation collected at the first contact with\nspecialist services.\nAs a final point, two limitations of the present\nstudy should be mentioned. First, as this is a\ncase register study, only the costs of care\nprovided by the specialist psychiatric system\nwere estimated; the total societal costs would be\nhigher, although it is likely that the major areas\nof care and treatment have been included.\nSecondly, the cost evaluation was limited to the\nfirst year following the index contact. While it\nwould be easy to solve the second problem by\nusing the present methodology for a selected\ncohort over a longer period of time, the first\nlimitation can be addressed only using ap-\npropriate instruments and a prospective research\ndesign. These studies are currently underway in\nSouth-Verona.\nMany thanks are due to Dr Franco Rossi (Instituto di\nEconomia Sanitaria, Milano) for his invaluable help\nin the development of the unit cost list and for many\nstimulating comments and suggestions.
