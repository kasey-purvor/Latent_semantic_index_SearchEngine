The paper presents an \nempirical analysis of bank industry M&As within the EU between 1993-2004 and identifies \npossible explanations for the patterns of consolidation. \nFindings \u2013 The analysis provides evidence that M&As predominantly take place at the \nnational level and that two main strategies have emerged, namely the consolidation of \ncommercial banking and the creation of universal banking groups. \nResearch limitations\/implications \u2013 Ten countries joined the EU in 2004 and are excluded \nfrom the analysis, due to data limitations. \n 2 \nPractical implications \u2013 More cross-border mergers should be encouraged if EU countries \nare to continue to integrate their financial markets. Moreover, if universal banking groups do \nnot succeed in exploiting the economies of scope on which they are founded, divestment of \nnon-core activities may follow, thus providing acquisition opportunities for others, with the \nresulting more focused organisations wishing to diversify geographically, via cross-border \nM&A. \nOriginality\/value \u2013The study suggests that the limited cross-border M&A activity observed \nmay be due to the existence of non-legislative barriers, such as internal control issues raised \nby geographic diversity and, more specifically, the perceived cultural barriers to pan-\nEuropean operation. \n \n \n 3 \nIntroduction \nOver the last two decades, the structure of the banking industry with the European Union \n(EU) has undergone significant re-shaping.  This has been driven by a number of factors \nincluding the integration and globalisation of financial markets, the proliferation of new \nfinancial products and services, the innovative processes by which they are delivered \n(particularly e-commerce), as well as the 1986 European Commission\u2019s programme aimed at \nthe establishment of a single market (Nellis et al., 2000). As a result, banks face important \nchallenges in order to survive and remain competitive, not only in their home markets, but \nalso more and more, internationally. Among the trends that have been emerging in the \nEuropean banking industry, evidence suggests that the industry is going through an \nintensified phase of Mergers and Acquisitions (M&As) activity (Lindblom and von Koch, \n2002). Nevertheless, as demonstrated by Hamoir et al. (2002), Europe\u2019s banking system is \nstill notably fragmented and consists of approximately 15,000 institutions. These \ndevelopments have raised considerable debate among policy makers, academic strategists and \npractitioners as to what should be the way forward and the role played by M&As in the \nrestructuring of European banking (Dermine, 2000). \nThis paper investigates the extent of consolidation in the banking industry that has taken \nplace across the European Union, the patterns that have emerged from the M&As and the \nregulatory framework that underpins these processes. The structure of the paper is as follows: \nin section 2, we briefly highlight the dynamics driving the developments of the EU bank \nindustry. Section 3 describes the process of consolidation in the EU and the reasons that have \nled some financial institutions to merge. Section 4 discusses the developments that have taken \nplace in the economic and political environment, as well as the changes in the legal \nframework, which have been crucial in providing the basis for deregulation and integration of \n 4 \nbanking systems. Section 5 concentrates on the discussion of the differences between \ndomestic M&As and their cross-border counterparts, as well as the motives that lead \ninstitutions to embark on international activities. Section 6 analyses the data on banking \nindustry M&As within the European Union over the period 1993-2004. The paper concludes \nwith a discussion of the main findings and possible explanations for the observed patterns of \nconsolidation.  \n \nDynamics of the EU bank industry \nThe EU bank industry finds itself in a mature phase of its life cycle with implications for \ngrowth and pressures on margins. The process of consolidation through M&A activity is one \nresponse of the industry to such challenges. However, before examining this process in some \ndetail, it is important to recognise that other opportunities for growth and improved margins \nexist. These include strategic alliances and organic growth (Johnson et al., 2005). While these \nare not the focus of this paper, it is important to acknowledge their significance with respect \nto the dynamics of the industry. We comment briefly on these alternative developments \nroutes below. \nStrategic alliances are a well-recognised route to growth and, for some organisations, may be \nmore attractive than one based on an acquisition strategy (Dyer et al., 2004). In the context of \nEU banking, strategic alliances are becoming increasingly important as a response to \ncompetition from traditional players (i.e. existing banks) and from non-traditional providers \nof credit (such as retailers ranging from grocery multiples to furniture stores). Such \npartnerships with some non-traditional players have become an important source of revenue \ngrowth in recent years. One of the most publicised alliances has been that between Tesco, the \nleading UK supermarket chain, and the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS). This alliance has \n 5 \ncreated a range of new business opportunities, in terms of growth and profitability, for both \npartners and has helped to support the diversification strategy of the supermarket chain. \nAlliances of this nature have been widely adopted between banking and a number of \ncomplementary industries (other examples are BNP Paribas and Carrefour, Bank of Scotland \nand Sainsbury\u2019s, to name but a few). \nAn alternative route to development is that based on organic growth (Ghoshal et al., 2000), \nembracing a range of internal developments within individual banks, which tend to focus on \nthe cost side of operations (Johnson et al., 2005). Such developments include improvements \nin the accuracy of information flowing between frontline and back office staff, the use of \nshared services such as the establishment of call centres and centralised administrative \nsupport units, as well as greater emphasis on improved risk management on the lending side. \nThe efficacy of these measures is evidenced by the significant reduction in banks\u2019 cost-to-\nincome ratios\n1\n. \nIn addition to these alternative growth routes, it should be appreciated that there are other \ndynamics taking place within the EU, with direct implications for the banking industry. These \ninclude the aging of the population, which can be expected to generate opportunities for new \nproduct and service developments. In addition, the greater mobility of people within Europe, \nresulting directly from the establishment of the Single European Market and the expansion of \nthe EU itself, will also enable banks to expand their customer base. Finally, the scale of the \n\u201cunbanked\u201d section of the EU population has been recognised as a key strategic issue for \nbanks. Responses to this have been catalysed by the growth in electronic payment systems \nand the need to minimise the cost of service provision. (Hogarth et al., 2005) \nHaving briefly reviewed alternative routes of development, we now concentrate on the causes \nand consequences of M&A activity within the EU banking industry.  \n 6 \n \nThe process of consolidation in the EU banking industry \nFollowing the wave of M&As in the USA in the 1980s, the European banking system has \nbeen experiencing an intensified phase of consolidation, particularly since the early 1990s \n(Lindblom and von Koch, 2002). The number and volume of M&As has increased \nsignificantly with the establishment of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) (Altunbas and \nIb\u00e1\u00f1ez, 2004). While cross-border mergers are still relatively infrequent, with the exception \nof Scandinavia and the Benelux countries (Boot, 2003), within-country mergers have taken a \nprominent role in the banking system and have generally involved large universal banks, such \nas the cases of: the Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corporation, National \nWestminster Bank with Royal Bank of Scotland and Paribas with Banque National de Paris. \n \nReasons for M&A activity \nIn a constantly changing competitive environment, which results from the increasing depth of \nintegration and globalisation of financial markets, financial institutions turn more and more to \nmergers and acquisitions to ensure the survival and\/or growth of their businesses. The \ndecision to consolidate should, in principle, be motivated by the desire to increase \nshareholder value, however agency conflicts between shareholders and managers can give \nrise to opposing motives for M&As (Berger et al., 1999). As suggested by Brouthers et al. \n(1998), the reasons for consolidation can be underpinned by economic, strategic and personal \nmotives. The interaction and the potential for conflict between these motives are highlighted \nin Figure 1 below. \n[Take in Figure 1] \n 7 \nThe desire to improve the financial performance of an institution is central to the economic \nargument for M&As. Specifically, this can be usually translated into measures taken which \naim at reducing costs, through rationalisation and taking advantage of economies of scale, or \nincreasing revenues and profitability, through economies of scope or the transfer of particular \nvalue creating capabilities (Walter and Barney, 1990). \nThe second purpose for the M&A decision is undoubtedly related to the particular strategic \nvision of the individual players involved. Hence, a firm may undertake an acquisition in order \nto enter a new geographical market, or to diversity away from its core business by entering a \nnew product sector, or to increase its penetration of an existing market or product sector.  In \nthe latter case, acquisition of an existing competitor may serve to increase the firm\u2019s overall \nmarket power, as well as to create entry barriers (Ingham et al., 1992). Companies may also \nbe strategically motivated to undertake an acquisition because they wish to strengthen their \nexisting resource base in a specific area, or because they lack a particular competence that \nwould be needed to develop their strategy by internal means. \nFinally, personal motives may also be one of the driving forces for the unification of some \nbanks. Mergers have often been associated with the possibility that managers may disregard, \nto a certain extent, the interests of stakeholders, as suggested by Lev (1983). According to \nRoll (1986), managers perceive mergers as an opportunity for their salaries to increase as a \nresult of the potential increase in sales.  Moreover, the fact that managers will then need to \noversee the operations of a larger company can also represent a new challenge for them, with \nthe opportunity to boost their personal career and status (Berkovitch and Narayanan, 1993). \nEven when one or more of the above motives are strong, the M&A decision may be \nconstrained by external influences, as highlighted in Figure 1. The economic environment \nand regulatory framework need to be conducive to the creation and operation of the resultant \n 8 \nentity. To place these external factors in context, we describe below the developments that \nhave taken place in the EU in recent decades. \n \nDevelopments in the economic and regulatory environment \nSince the 1957 Treaty of Rome, the need to transform a highly segmented Europe into an \nintegrated one has been recognised. Since then, several steps have been taken towards \nderegulation and harmonisation of banking regulations. In 1973, the Council of Ministers \nadopted a directive on the abolition of restrictions on freedom of establishment and freedom \nto provide services for self-employed activities of banks and other financial institutions \n(Directive 73\/183, EEC). In 1977, the first banking directive on the coordination of laws, \nregulations and administrative provisions relating to the taking up and pursuit of credit \ninstitutions was also adopted (Directive 77\/780\/EEC). However, it was the principle of \nfreedom of circulation of goods, services, people and capital, formalised by the completion of \nthe European Single Market in 1993, that made it possible for all financial institutions in the \nEU to establish branches and to offer cross-border services in other member countries, as \nlong as they were authorised to do so in their home country. This provided the basis for what \nis nowadays known as the universal banking model (Nellis et al., 2000), thus transforming \nthe way in which banking activities have since been conducted. \nAnother important step towards European integration within the EU has been the adoption by \n12 EU members of the Euro and therefore, their adherence to EMU. This has had a number of \nimportant implications for the banking industry. For example, it has changed the structure of \nthe corporate bond and equity markets because savers were now able to diversify their \nportfolio across EMU members, without having to consider exchange rate risk. In addition, it \nhas also changed the approach by institutions to the management of credit risk. Potential \n 9 \nasymmetric shocks may affect economies differently and the policies of the European Central \nBank may not always suit all member countries. Therefore, this potentially requires the need \nfor international diversification of loan portfolios. \nAt the national level, the regulatory framework is generally regarded as well-developed, \nproviding the necessary tools to assess M&As. However, cross-border M&As often require \nthe accommodation of differences in accounting rules and in taxation policy. Further \nconsideration also needs to be given to prudential rules and practices (Hamoir et al., 2002). \nThe Financial Services Action Plan was adopted in 1999 by the European Commission as an \nattempt to deal with such issues. The intention of this plan is the development of the \nlegislative and non-legislative frameworks in order to foster an optimal single financial \nmarket, underpinned by up-to-date prudential rules and adequate supervision.  \nFurthermore, the 2004 Basel II Accord, which is aimed at international convergence of \ncapital measurement and capital standards, set out new minimum regulatory capital \nrequirements for banks (Kanbay, 2005). These requirements have been established in an \nattempt to minimise potential risks faced by the financial system in periods of economic \nturbulence (Caruana, 2005; Claessens et al., 2005). The new standards may promote mergers \nbetween banks in an attempt to strengthen the capital adequacy of the participants. \n \nIssues confronting cross-border M&As  \nDespite the range of measures that have been put in place to facilitate the integration of EU \nfinancial markets and the efforts to diminish the difficulties that financial institutions face \nwhen opting for cross-border business, there remain crucial differences in the establishment \nof within-country and cross-border M&As. In this context, it is important to highlight the \n 10 \nsignificance of regulatory and management issues, as well as the motivational aspects that \ngive rise to cross-border M&As. \n \nThe regulatory context \nThe progressive harmonisation of banking legislation across EU countries has been an \nimportant step towards the facilitation of deals between financial groups of different countries \n(Flier et al., 2001). However there still remains the risk of supervisory arbitrage and therefore \nthe process of M&As across borders requires continuous monitoring to ensure a level \nplaying-field. \nAnother point to take into account is the need for supervisory authorities to monitor capital \nadequacy, as sometimes this may be relaxed in order to focus on the needs of shareholders, \nwhich may lower the merger\u2019s capacity to withstand financial difficulties. \nMoreover, in many cross-border M&As, it is common practice that the main institution \noperates in the other countries in the form of subsidiaries (Rangan, 2000). It is therefore \nimportant that the \u201dhost\u201d authority supervises the subsidiaries on a consolidated basis and is \ngoverned by general rules. \n \nManagement issues  \nRelated to these regulatory issues, cross-border M&As also raise a number of internal \nmanagement matters. These are related to control, to the understanding of new national \ncultures, necessary for the enhancement of market know-how, and to the internal cultural \n 11 \ncompatibility compounded by national cultural differences. We comment on each of these \nbelow. \nIn terms of managerial control, mergers and acquisitions, particularly across borders, increase \nthe complexity of a firm\u2019s operations through the enlarged scale and scope of its activities. \nThis complexity makes the management of a bank\u2019s financial and operational risk more \ndifficult and calls for increasingly sophisticated internal control mechanisms. Related to the \nissue of managerial control is the selection of appropriate organisational structure. For \nexample, a centralised structure may facilitate the monitoring of internal risk and the capture \nof scale economies, but, relative to a decentralised form, may fail to provide the necessary \nawareness of and responsiveness to local market conditions. \nIn addition, the understanding of national cultural contexts is also crucial to the success of \ncross-border M&As. National diversity remains a notable feature of the European business \nenvironment, where differing national cultures and heritages have produced business \npractices and consumer characteristics that vary considerably from one nation to another \n(Nicoll and Schoenberg, 1999). These differences in national contexts may make it difficult \nto capture revenue enhancement from cross-selling opportunities and, furthermore, may limit \nthe ability of managers from one national market to understand the precise elements \nnecessary for successful operation in another national market (Newman and Nollen, 1996). \nFinally, it is important to consider how the corporate cultures and the employees of the two \nfinancial institutions will partner to create synergies (Olian, 2002). Research on domestic \nacquisitions has highlighted that differences in organisational culture and managerial \napproach between the two combining firms can result in increased employee stress, reduced \nwork performance and other integration difficulties, which may ultimately lead to an inferior  \nacquisition outcomes. These issues may be compounded in cross-border acquisitions, which, \n 12 \nin addition to possible differences in organisational culture, may also involve the combination \nof personnel and capabilities that are characterised by differences in language, national \nculture, and institutional contexts. Indeed, a number of empirical studies have found that the \ngreater the national cultural distance between the acquiring and acquired firms, the lower the \nsubsequent financial performance of the cross-border acquisition (Schoenberg, 2000). \nSo, what motivates financial institutions to embark on cross-border business? The following \nsub-section discusses the main reasons for going international. \n \nMotivation for cross-border M&As \nWe have discussed earlier the reasons that underpin the merging of financial institutions. \nThere are certain circumstances however, that lead banks to opt for foreign partners. Most \ncross-border mergers can be explained by one or more motives involving size, scale, scope \nand legislative context. \nThe first motive for cross-border mergers is size, which provides the opportunity for the \ngroup to compete not only at the national, but also regional or even global level. Size is \nimportant from two aspects: in terms of the resultant size of the bank and also in terms of the \nsize of the clients it is able to attract. Large, international banks are generally better \npositioned to respond to the needs of multinational clients, especially where they share a \ncommon geographic footprint. \nThe second motive which attracts banks to cross-border mergers is scale, particularly on the \nrevenue side. A large, international bank can take advantage of a greater customer base and a \nlarger market and can therefore enjoy economies of scale related to the increase in revenue \n(Boot, 2003). It should be noted that in contrast to scale economies on the revenue side, the \n 13 \npotential benefits with respect to cost reductions are likely to be less in the case of cross-\nborder mergers than those that can be expected to exist in the case of within-country \nmergers(Altunbas et al., 1997). \nThe physical scale of the customer base resultant from cross-border merger can also be \nexpected to provide opportunities for the new organisation in terms of  economies of scope, \nsince an enlarged bank may make it viable to offer certain services such as asset management \nand cross-selling of strong brands (Giovanni, 2005). \nThe final motivation for cross-border concentration is related to the fact that further M&A \nactivity of large banks within a country may sometimes face opposition stemming from \ndomestic legislation concerning market dominance. Thus, going international may be seen as \na practical and appropriate response to the potential restriction confronting banks across the \nEU. It is an empirical matter as to whether or not banks have or will respond to anti-trust \nlegislation. Bearing these points in mind, we now turn to the investigation of the M&As that \nhave taken place across EU countries since 1993. \n \nThe patterns of M&A activity \u2013 1993 to 2004 \nWe investigate the patterns of bank industry M&As in the EU over the period 1993 to 2004. \nThis covers a total of 975 deals which have resulted in either a merger or an acquisition. The \ndata have been drawn from two sources, namely SDC Platinum and Datastream. The \nstatistical analysis reported below concentrates on M&As in which the target is a financial \ninstitution which is based in one of the 15 member countries of the EU\n2\n. It is important to \npoint out that the acquiring institution can be of non-EU origin. The analysis reported here \nonly considers M&As which have been completed by the end of 2004 and where the value of \n 14 \nthe M&A has been disclosed. All of the target institutions included in the analysis are from \nwithin the financial sector and fall  into one of the following United States Standard \nIndustrial Classification (SIC) categories: 60, 61 and 62. These SIC categories include \ncommercial banks, savings banks, real estate and mortgage banks as well as investment \nbanks. \n \nThe overall scale of M&As \nFigures 2 and 3 show the total number and value of M&As that have taken place in the EU \nbanking industry in the period chosen (1993-2004). As can be seen from Figure 2, the total \nnumber of bank M&As has increased significantly from a total of 41 M&As in 1993 to 83 in \n2004, peaking in 2001 when 111 M&As took place. From this figure, we can also see that a \nconsiderable amount of M&A activity has taken place in the UK (for instance, in 2001, 57% \nof all EU banking sector M&As took place there). For practical reasons, the M&As in the \nremaining countries are grouped into four other categories: the first one includes the main \neconomies of the EU (excluding the UK), comprising France, Germany, Italy and Spain\n3\n. The \nsecond category includes the Benelux countries (Belgium, The Netherlands and \nLuxembourg). Collectively, Greece, Ireland and Portugal constitute the third category. The \ncountries that joined the EU in 1995 (Austria, Finland and Sweden), together with Denmark \nrepresent the last category. \n[Take in Figure 2] \nTurning to Figure 3, the value of total M&A activity increased significantly between 1994 \nand 1999 for some country groups and 2000 for others. There has been a notable decline in \nthe value of bank M&A activity generally since then, following a similar pattern to the \n 15 \nnumber of deals completed. Furthermore, while the annual average number of M&As over \nthe period considered has increased by approximately 11%, the annual amount of money \ninvolved in M&A activity has expanded by 58% over the same period, indicating that the \naverage transaction value has increased. The contrast between the number and value of \nM&As may be due to one or more reasons \u2013reflecting, perhaps, the desire by acquirers to \ntake over larger financial institutions, or the decline in the availability of smaller targets\n4\n. \nIt is also worth noting that the number of M&As exhibits less volatility than the value of \ndeals - see Figures 2 and 3. For example, there are pronounced peaks in terms of value in the \nUK in 1995, 2000 and 2004, in the other \u2018core\u2019 countries in 1999 and in the Benelux in 1998.  \nInspection of the underlying data indicates that these peaks are due to major M&A deals \nwhich were completed in these years. Such large deals have important implications for the \nbanking structure in the respective nations and for the European banking industry more \ngenerally. A brief description of these major M&As is provided in Table I. It is significant \nthat only one of these seven major deals were cross-border in nature - namely the takeover of \nAbbey National plc by Banco Santander Central Hispano in 2004\n5\n. \n[Take in Figure 3] \n[Take in Table I] \nFigure 4 shows the magnitude of M&A activity in the EU banking system over the period, \nexpressed as a percentage of the total market value of the EU banking sector. The figure \nshows that excluding two years, 1995 and 2000, the value of the M&A activity each year was \nless than 10% of the market value of the banking system. It will also be seen that, after a \nbuoyant period of M&A deals, the relative scale of consolidation within the industry (as \nM&A activity itself is still up in terms of absolute number and value) has now faded to levels \nsimilar to those experienced at the beginning of the 1990s. \n 16 \n[Take in Figure 4] \nThis could be due to two main reasons: on the one hand, financial groups may now find \nthemselves in a position where it is believed that there are limited opportunities for \neconomies of scale from which they could benefit by merging with another group or, perhaps \na more assertive reason, is the fact that most of the M&A activity has so far been \nconcentrated in domestic markets \u2013 suggesting that EU and domestic regulations or non-\nregulatory obstacles may have discouraged cross-border deals. The following subsection \nanalyses the levels of M&A activity both within-country and cross-border. \n \nWithin-country versus cross-border M&As \nFigure 5 presents M&A activity (in terms of value), by classifying the deals into four \ncategories:  \n\u2022 within-country M&As involving financial groups which operate in the same sector\n6\n \n(intra-sector, intra-nation),  \n\u2022 within-country M&As involving groups which operate in different sectors (inter-\nsector, intra-nation),  \n\u2022 cross-border M&As from within the same sector (intra-sector, inter-nation) and  \n\u2022 cross-border M&As between groups from different sectors (inter-sector, inter-nation). \n[Take in Figure 5] \nFrom the figure, it is clear that, in most years, the majority of M&A activity takes place \nwithin countries rather than across borders (with the exceptions of 1993 and 2004). The year \n 17 \n1993 corresponds to the completion of the agreement on the free movement of capital within \nthe EU, creating therefore an incentive (at least in the short run) for deals to be made across \nfrontiers. In 2004, one of the few big cross-border mergers took place - between Abbey \nNational (UK) and Santander Central Hispano (Spain). The fact that there have been so few \ncross-border M&As raises a question concerning the impact of the Single European Market \nlegislation, the introduction of the Euro and the regulatory reforms in promoting an \nenvironment conducive to European integration, as evidenced by cross-border M&A activity. \nTable II highlights the sharp distinction shown in Figure 5 between within-country and cross-\nborder deals.  \n[Take in Table II] \nFinally, Tables III and IV present M&As disaggregated by type of bank, expressed in terms \nof value and number of deals respectively. Table III provides evidence to show that intra-\nsector M&As have dominated consolidation activity for 8 of the 12 years studied.  It also \nshows that, in terms of value, the majority of M&As involved at least one commercial bank \nand, in most years over half of all M&A activity has involved intra-sector mergers between \ncommercial banks \n[Take in Table III] \nHowever, when M&As are distributed by type of bank in terms of the number of deals \ncompleted, Table IV reveals that a growing percentage of mergers has involved institutions \nthat concentrate on investment activities. In fact, mergers solely between investment banks or \nwhere at least one of the partners is an investment bank, have been growing in relative terms, \npeaking in 2001, when more than half of the total number of mergers in the EU included an \ninvestment institution. \n 18 \n[Take in Table IV] \nIt also appears from Table IV that around half of all transactions are inter-sector. In fact, \ninter-sector M&As accounted for the majority of activity by number in 7 out of the 12 years. \nThis suggests that, while consolidation of the commercial banking sector accounts for a large \nproportion of the value of M&A activity, there is a significant number of inter-sector deals \nreflecting the building of universal banking groups.  \nThe information reported in Tables III and IV would seem to support the argument that there \nare two strategic trends emerging in the European banking industry \u2013 one of consolidation of \ncommercial banks and the other of growth in universal banks. \n \nConclusions \nThis paper has looked at the pattern of M&As in the EU banking system. Using data for the \nperiod 1993 to 2004, two conclusions emerge. First, the evidence suggests that the \npredominant strategies driving M&A activity have been the consolidation of commercial \nbanking at the national level and the creation of universal banking groups. Secondly, it is \nnotable that M&As continue to take place largely within national borders.   \nThere have been some cross-border M&As, mainly in the late 1990s and in the earlier part of \nthe current decade. These have been small in number but have tended to involve major \nfinancial groups. This appears to be mainly due to the fact that the large financial institutions \nhave the resources to assess better the risk (and also the return) involved in operating in a \nforeign country than smaller players. This is further illustrated by the fact that the \nacquisitions that have taken place in the new members of the EU (Central and Eastern \n 19 \nEuropean countries) have usually involved a major Western financial group (Figueira et al., \n2005). \nThere has been considerable change in the political, regulatory, social and economic \nenvironment within the EU in the last decade. There have been a number of drivers of change \ninvolving, for example, the establishment of the European Single Market, the expansion of \nEU membership, the creation of the Euro and the introduction of the Financial Services Act \nPlan. These have all played a role in supporting the integration of Europe\u2019s banking and \ncapital markets. Therefore, it can be argued that significant progress has been made towards \nthe establishment of a legislative environment that is conducive to cross-border M&As. At \nthe same time, changes in the global regulatory framework (based on the Basel Accords) also \nhave implications for decisions relating to bank consolidation in many countries, not least in \nEurope. Nevertheless, the empirical evidence reported in this paper indicates that cross-\nborder M&As remain limited in number \u2013 more cross-border mergers must be encouraged \nand facilitated if EU countries are to continue to integrate their financial markets. \nThe cause of limited cross-border M&A activity may be explained by the existence of non-\nlegislative barriers, such as the internal control issues raised by geographic diversity and, \nmore especially, the perceived cultural barriers to pan-European operation. As we have \nindicated earlier, the latter include both national differences in consumer preferences and \nattitudes, which maintain the need to tailor products for individual national markets, as well \nas differences in national institutional contexts, which may constrain the opportunities for \ncommon operating practices. \nIt may be that we will see an increase in cross-border M&A over the coming years. It is \nreasonable to assume that it will take a number of years before the full effect of regulatory \nreforms is felt (such as the reforms based on the Financial Services Act Plan and the Basel \n 20 \nAccords). There is also a widely held perception that national cultures and the associated \nconsumer preferences may be slowly converging across Europe. Indeed, the industry has seen \nsome notable examples of successful pan-European product innovation in recent years (for \nexample, ING Direct savings).  \nA further boost for cross-border activity may also result from the two corporate strategies that \nour data suggest have driven M&A activity over the past decade. The consolidation of \ncommercial banking at the national level will, at some point, become constrained by anti-trust \nconsiderations, perhaps prompting these banks to look beyond their traditional national \nborders and begin the building of pan-European positions. The second strategy evident within \nour data is the creation of universal banking groups. At present, it appears unclear as to \nwhether such diversified groups will succeed in exploiting the economies of scope on which \nthey are founded. If they do not achieve their promise, divestment of non-core activities may \nfollow, as these groups concentrate their business within a single sector. Not only would this \nprovide acquisition opportunities for others, but the resulting more focused organisations may \nthen wish to diversify geographically, via cross-border M&A, rather than by sector as in the \npast. Both of these possibilities are consistent with, and would be promoted by, cultural and \nregulatory convergence. \nOverall, the prospect of further bank industry M&A appears high. This is not to say that \nM&A activity will necessarily lead to profitable growth. It is well documented that M&As \nare high risk, with almost half of all cross-border acquisitions failing to meet their original \nobjectives or destroying shareholder value (Schoenberg, 2006). M&As may give institutions \naccess to more clients but, for example, they do not always improve profit margins or the \nquality of the loan portfolio. Successful growth through acquisition will still require banks to \n 21 \npay careful attention to maintaining a strong and differentiated customer proposition together \nwith a competitive cost structure. \n \n 22 \nReferences \nAltunbas, Y. and Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez, D.M.

However, we have \ngrouped it here to reflect the significant developments that have taken place in Spain over the last decade, \nboth in terms of the banking sector and the economy in general. \n4\n The underlying motives of acquirers constitutes an important research question in the context of M&A activity. \nHowever this question is not the purpose of this paper since we are concerned with the overall pattern and \nscale of activity in this sector. \n5\n The takeover of Belgian bank Generale de Banque SA by Fortis AG could be seen as cross-border nature, \nsince in 1998 Fortis AG was a Dutch-Belgian banking and insurance group (European Commission, 1998). \n6\n The sector of a bank was defined by the SIC code of its primary activity. \n"}
