Commercial jet transport MRO market during 2001 will reach\na worldwide total revenue of about US$42.2 billion. This value is expected to grow to a value\nbetween US$52.9 and US$65.7 billion (before inflation) in the next ten years [1]. Aircraft\nmodification and heavy maintenance is to account for about a third of the work, and this does not\ninclude military aircraft.\nThird party aircraft modification companies work on a wide range of aeroplanes and modification\ntypes. Aircraft modifications range from small changes in cabin d\u00e9cor to complete passenger to\nfreight conversions for any type of aircraft, in both civil and military aviation. Modifications are\ncarried out for many different reasons; such as extend aircraft life, change aircraft functionality,\ncomply with new safety and environmental regulations, and improve reliability, mission capability,\nor passenger comfort [2,3]. Modification contracts may cover a number of aircraft or just a one-of-\na-kind job. Short runs to carry out very specialised type of jobs are very common and most\nmodifications are carried out on a make-to-order basis.\nContract bidding is an important process for any aircraft modification contractors. After a customer\nrequests a bid proposal, the job has to be evaluated, information collected and an initial assessment\nof the job is done. This analysis is the basis of the \u2018bid\/no bid\u2019 decision. If the decision is to bid,\nthen some resources will be committed to the project definition stage. In the competitive aircraft\nmodification market, only about 15% to 30% of the bids result in successful contracts. It is\ntherefore important to minimise the costs incurred during the bidding phase. Cost estimating relies\n5heavily on in-house expertise, as no published data is generally available.\nAs there are very few jobs that are exactly the same. It is rare to be able to exactly copy\ninformation from a previous project. If the information is structured into the appropriate packages\nrequired by the different departments, it might be possible to reuse elements of information from\nprevious projects. Past information could then be used as a basis to extrapolate to the needs of the\nnew proposal.\nDetail bid analysis information is normally archived by the individuals and seldom shared. A Work\nBreakdown Structure (WBS) that could be used as the basis for information collection and reuse\ncould enhance knowledge sharing. A unified process and the use of a common WBS forms the\nbasis for estimates to be compared with historical estimation data [4,5]. Information reuse can\nreduce the resources and lead times required for creating bids.\nThe first part of the paper presents aircraft modification characteristics from a contractor point of\nview. The second part shows the way project scope changes through the life stages. The final part\nexplains the integrated WBS concept.\n2 Research approach\nAn action research approach was used for the development of this study. The need for a\ncontribution to knowledge and the applicability of the research were the main aspects considered.\nThe research could be broadly divided into three stages or cycles: The starting point for the\nresearch was the interest in improving cost estimating for aircraft modification. The first cycle of\n6the research concentrated in analysing the bid preparation processes and developing an\nunderstanding of the aircraft modification characteristics. The second research cycle studied the\nevolution of aircraft modification project through its life cycle, with main interest in understanding\nthe link between scope and cost and providing a solution to the need for different views of the cost\nthrough project life cycle and the reuse of the cost information such as for cost estimating. The last\nstage of the research was carried out to refine the model and improve its usability. After each cycle\nthe findings were implemented in the collaborating company. Observing the results of the\nimplementation carried out after each cycle led to the following research cycle [1].\nThe research used qualitative collection methods and six case studies. It was carried out only in\none collaborating company due to the commercial implications of accessing confidential cost\ninformation. However, the collaborating company is a well established enterprise and results are\nconsidered representative for the whole business. The models developed during the research are\nconsidered generic and should be applicable to other aircraft modification businesses. The research\nwas validated through the presentation of small steps to the different personnel within the\ncollaborating company, where more than fifty people were interviewed. The agreement and\nvalidation of the steps within the action research approach confirmed the validity and applicability\nof the research results progress.\n73 The aircraft modification life cycle\nAircraft modifications usually involve one or more of the following tasks: design, manufacturing,\ninstallation and support.\nThe aircraft modification life cycle can be divided into the following typical stages: feasibility\nstudy, definition, execution, termination\/completion and operation. The first four stages are the\nmain stages of the aircraft modification project. Since most of the aircraft modification projects are\nmake-to-order, it is useful to group these stages into two phases depending on the time when the\ncontract is awarded. The first is the bid preparation phase, covering the feasibility study and the\ndefinition stages. The second is the project execution (realisation) phase, which covers the\nexecution and termination stages. The aircraft modification life cycle is presented in Figure 1. This\ncan also be considered as a typical aircraft modification project plan, with the product support as\nadditional activity after the project is completed. This model presents the different activities that\nare required to specify and complete the modification product.\nAfter the bid is presented to the customer, there may be some contract negotiations. If the bid is\naccepted, the project moves into the execution phase. In the aircraft modification business, contract\naward and project execution may take place months or years after the bid was presented. A\ndifferent team rather than the one that prepare the bid may have to be assembled to carry out the\nproject. If the project information is compiled in a standard way, then anyone within the company\ncan rapidly understand and reuse the invested efforts.\n8The first activity after the project is awarded is detail design. This includes the planning for all the\ndesign activities, the creation of production drawings and all the documentation to support the\ndesign. The detail design stage follows the preliminary design and the information generated in bid\npreparation is a useful input for this process.\nAfter the design drawings and information are released, plans for manufacturing, installation and\nprocurement are defined. Estimates are revised and budgets are assigned to each activity. The\ndetailed tasks and activities to be carried out by the shop operators are further defined and\nschedules for them created. The procurement plan is also defined and integrated with the\nmanufacturing and installation plans.\nTest design and certification plans are also done at the same time as the installation and\nmanufacturing plan and detail design. Test engineers have to design the tests that demonstrate to\nthe customer that the aircraft can perform to the expectation. The tests have to demonstrate to the\naviation authorities that the modifications carried out comply with the regulations. A detailed plan\nhas to be developed for the tests to be carried out. All the relevant documentation has to be issued\nand submitted to the aviation authorities to obtain the necessary approval before the tests are\ncarried out. Depending on the type of modification, test and certification can be very expensive.\nManufacturing fabricates the different parts required for a modification and assembles them into\nsub-assemblies and modification kits that are to be installed in the aircraft, for example a cargo\ndoor. In some cases, the partial sub-assembly of the modification kits is not necessary, the parts\nwill be installed directly into the aircraft. One characteristic of the modification manufacturing and\n9sub-assembly is that it is carried out before the aircraft is actually on the ground. Aircraft\ndowntime has to be minimised, as the aircraft is not generating revenue when it is on the ground.\nThis means that the modification kits or parts are actually finished before it is possible to see the\naircraft.\nAs the modification organisation is a third party organisation and not the Original Equipment\nManufacturer (OEM), it is necessary to obtain drawings from the OEM. The drawings available\nmay be from a different version of the aircraft. For example the aircraft concerned may be thirty\nyears old but the drawings from that old version may not be available and it is only possible to\nhave drawings of a later version. Also the aircraft may have had previous work that is not known to\nthe modification organisation. All this means that deviations to the original drawings, which are\nused as the basis for the modification design and manufacturing, may only be identified when the\naircraft is in the hangars and has been stripped down. Deviations may also be caused by particular\noperating environment and service history. These situations differentiate aircraft modification from\nnew aircraft manufacturing. New aircraft parts are manufactured to drawings and assembled to\nplans. Deviations discovered on old aircraft may require costly additional work.\nIf the modification is to be introduced to a series of aircraft, the first one is used as a trial. The trial\naircraft installation is carried out before the production series to ensure that installation problems\nare identified and corrected before work starts in the rest of the series. Testing and certification are\ncarried out using this aircraft to demonstrate compliance with the customer and certification\nrequirements. If additional work is necessary, they could be identified before the production run\nstarts. Trial aircraft installation, testing & certification should not overlap or have only a minimum\n10\noverlap with the production aircraft.\nConcurrent with the trial aircraft installation, testing & certification, the product support package is\ndesigned. The task is to document the effects that the modification has in the operation of the\naircraft. The technical publications department updates the aircraft manuals including the flight\nmanual and the weight balance manual. The Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) is defined and\nfuture maintenance, training, spares and rotables required are identified. The product support\ndesign are finalised after the results from the testing & certification are known.\nOnce the product has been tested and certified the production run is carried out according to the\nfinal configuration achieved. The production modification may be applied to an entire fleet of\naircraft or just to a few aircraft. It is also possible that there are no production runs as the\nmodification is one-of-a-kind. In many cases short runs are commissioned. It is very important to\nkeep non-recurring costs as low as possible as it is unlikely to amortise the cost over a long\nproduction run.\nAfter the last production aircraft is delivered the aircraft modification project finishes. However,\nsometimes product support is provided by the aircraft modification organisation such as 24hr on-\nline support or spares and rotables provision.\n4 The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)\nThe use of the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) concept for project management was first\nformalised by the US Department of Defense and NASA in 1962 [7].\n11\nAccording to reference [8]: \u201cA work breakdown structure is a product-oriented family tree\ncomposed of hardware, services and data which result from project engineering efforts during the\ndevelopment and production of a defence material item, and which completely defines the\nproject\/program. A WBS displays and defines the product(s) to be developed or produced and\nrelates the elements of work to be accomplish to each other and to the end product.\u201d\nThe WBS provides a way of decomposing the work required to achieve the final project\ndeliverable. This is done in a hierarchical fashion, decomposing the work from major tasks to\nsmaller ones. By doing so, the complexity of the project tasks is reduced as the tasks are broken\ndown until they reach a manageable size. The lowest level elements of the WBS used for project\nmanagement are usually called work packages.\nThe WBS defines the project tasks and therefore it defines the scope for the work required for the\nproject. The correct use of a WBS contributes significantly to the probability of project completion\n[9]. The capability to identify all the tasks required for a project has a big impact in the project.\nMissing tasks is critical and may have disastrous consequences. In the aircraft modification\nbusiness most contracts are fixed price, thus the modification organisation bears the risk of the\nproject. If tasks are missed during the bid preparation phase, the organisation has to pay for the\nmissed tasks. The profitability of the project will be affected.\nThe way a WBS is constructed and therefore a project is defined can be done in many different\nways. The different possibilities reflect the preference of the people creating the WBS. Globerson\n12\n[9] showed how the WBS of a project could be developed in different ways depending on the view\ntaken. Different approaches to the hierarchical decomposition of a project could be taken. The\nfollowing approaches or views may be considered:\n\uf0b7 Product-oriented\n\uf0b7 Process or functional\n\uf0b7 Organisational\n\uf0b7 Logistics\n\uf0b7 Timing or project life cycle\n\uf0b7 Geographic location of people or divisional organisations\n\uf0b7 Economic benefit, type of cost\n\uf0b7 Project management style (centralised, etc..)\n\uf0b7 Location of work in the product\nThe way the WBS is constructed depends on the view used. The view or views used usually\ndepend on the business of the organisation carrying out the job, such as manufacturing, services,\nconstruction, city council, etc. and the characteristics of the specific organisation. At the lowest\nlevels the work packages may be the same work. However, depending on the view, the higher\nlevels are different and this has an influence in the way the project is managed.\nThe concept of what is considered the WBS is defined in different ways in the literature. The key is\nwhat should be included in the second level of the WBS, starting with the first level being the total\nproject. Sometimes the WBS is considered to be the Product Breakdown Structure (PBS). In most\ncases the WBS is considered to be the combination of the PBS together with the major tasks that\n13\nmust be performed to create the product, such as project management, which is not part of the\nproduct but an essential process required to create the product. Some authors call this the Project\nBreakdown Structure [10] to emphasise that it is the combination of product and process or tasks.\nOther views are used to break down projects that use different elements in the top levels. These\nviews are given other names such as Organisation Breakdown Structure (OBS), Cost Breakdown\nStructure (CBS), Contract Breakdown Structure, Location Breakdown Structure and Project Life\nCycle Structure. To represent the different views or approaches to project structuring and\nmanagement, the WBS defined previously is usually combined with other views such as the OBS\nor the CBS, thus obtaining a multidimensional approach [11].\nThe WBS structure has an integrative role in the project, as lower level tasks are associated and\nintegrated into the higher level ones. Different persons within the organisation can use it to obtain\nthe information that they need. For example top management is interested in the top levels to gain\nan overall project perspective while middle level managers use the information to manage the\nitems they are responsible for. The WBS also provides a holistic view of the project so that\neveryone can have a total picture of the project and what the other people within the organisation\nare doing.\nThe WBS is probably the most single valuable tool for project management. The WBS defines the\nscope and structure of the project and establishes the foundation for:\n\uf0b7 Planning (cost estimating, scheduling)\n\uf0b7 Budgeting\n14\n\uf0b7 Responsibility assignment\n\uf0b7 Project control\n\uf0b7 Information management (technical and others)\nAny project information, such as cost, schedules, people, technical documents or any other type of\ninformation can be stored using the WBS structure. The WBS usually works with a numbering\nsystem to identify the different elements in it. The integration of the tasks into different levels is\nfacilitated by the numbering system. Project information is collated and processed according to the\nnumbering system. The number of levels in the WBS varies depending on the needs to divide the\ntasks into smaller ones, but not all the elements will have the same number of sub-levels. The WBS\ncan be presented in two different ways:\n\uf0b7 Charts with tree structure\n\uf0b7 Indented text with a numerical classification\n5 The aircraft modification work scope and its different views and steps\nThe scope of a project can be defined in many different ways. Depending on the person and the\npersonal needs, the tasks are defined in one way or another. As Kliem and Ludin [12] explained,\nwhen building a WBS people tend to perceive tasks in different ways, depending on their\nperspective such as client, project manager, senior management and project team members. The\ndifferent perceptions of how the WBS should be built could create conflicts and seeking consensus\nis a cumbersome process. One consequence is that the different disciplines and persons may end up\nworking with different WBS\u2019s. For instance, each department within an organisation may end up\nworking with a different WBS that suits the needs of that department very well but loses the\n15\nintegrative picture that the WBS should provide. In this section, the different people that should\ncontribute to the definition of the WBS for an aircraft modification project are analysed.\nTherefore, managing the way a WBS is defined is not easy. Different languages are used by people\nthat carry out different activities. Also, different expertises may need different levels of detail.\nThere is a need for cooperation when building a bid and it is difficult because of the contradictory\nrequirements that exist sometimes. When the project requires many different types of expertise this\nbecomes more complicated.s The main existing approach to building the WBS is to collate the\npeople from the different trades during the planning of the project and then agree a WBS. This\nneeds to be done each time a project is carried out. In this way, the cost element structure is co-\nbuilt with a sort of neutral language. In terms of the reuse of information, the most common\napproach is to use past projects or project templates for producing new WBS\u2019s. However, if the\nvariation in projects is very large this is difficult. These approaches do not solve the problem of\nconsidering the different views and needs.\nWhen looking at the need to close the loop and reuse cost information to compare with estimates,\nso that learning and corrections can be applied, there are many difficulties in make-to-order\ncompanies. There are different reasons for this, disjoints in data formats between cost estimating\nand execution of projects appear to be the main problem. Data collections do not comply with\nestimating formats, changes during production, intermediate estimates or different people\ninvolvement are some of the reasons that difficult this link [13].\nA WBS is not a static structure. In the aircraft modification process it is extremely important to\n16\nconsider the dynamic nature of the WBS with the project life cycle. There are many uncertainties\nthat are implicit within the process of aircraft modification. For example in a newly manufactured\naircraft all the parts to be manufactured and assembled are known. A template or standard that\ndefines the different parts and systems of an aircraft can be defined and used throughout the\naircraft construction. That is, however, not as straight forward in the aircraft modification business.\nFor example in the modification of an avionics system, the tasks required are different depending\non the aircraft make, model, version and other factors. Depending on the aircraft design some parts\nmay have to be removed, but because each aircraft is different the parts to be removed may be\ndifferent for each aircraft. Modifying one part in some cases may affect a certain system and\nsometimes may affect a different one, again depending on the aircraft design. Therefore the same\ntask at the high level work scope may require different sub-tasks for different aircraft. To illustrate\nthis further, imagine that a car garage needs to make a modification to the carburettor of a classic\ncar, and a bigger one is to be installed. Depending on the position of the carburettor in the car and\nthe space available, the parts next to the carburettor may need to be moved or a more substantial\nre-design is needed. In some cars the engine may need to be moved, in other cars it may be a\ndifferent part. Also, in some cases the existing pipes may be suitable for the new carburettor, in\nothers a redesign could be required. This depends on the specific car. The exact work definition\ncannot be defined until some design work has been completed. In the aircraft modification\nbusiness, all this is done without actually seeing the aircraft, decisions have to be made based on\nthe drawings that are available. Thus, trying to completely scope a modification job at the very\nbeginning before detailed information is available is not possible. At different stages of the project,\ndifferent information is available to increase the accuracy of the WBS definition.\n17\nThe WBS and the project work scope life cycle of an aircraft modification project is analysed in\nthis section. The different people and the different views that they have of the tasks are brought\ntogether with the stages of the aircraft modification life cycle. Figure 2 shows the integration of\nthese two perspectives. The differences and changes in the WBS and the inputs required through\nthe life cycle of the modification project are studied. The people involved in the development of\nthe WBS are divided into the departments to which they belong and it reflects the structure of the\ncollaborating company. To help in understanding this model it is necessary to clarify that\nestimations for design activities are usually carried out by the designers while the estimations for\nmanufacturing and installation are carried out by the estimating department.\n5.1 Job description\nThe first activity to define the scope of a project is to collect all the information about the product\nto be developed and the project. The WBS does not exist yet but it is vital to be able to capture all\nthe information necessary to create one. The result is a descriptive list with the characteristics of\nthe modification product and the tasks required to complete it. The information includes type of\nmodification, equipment to be installed, type of certification or testing required, etc. The collection\nof this information occurs during the feasibility study of the project. This activity is carried out\nprimarily by the marketing department, although commercial, engineering and other departments\nmay also participate.\n5.2 Bid scope\nThe bid scope stage of the project life cycle is to create the bid proposal. The output is the WBS\nthat is used for the bid. The building of this WBS involves people from different departments and\n18\nis an iterative process that requires continuous refinement.\nWithout an integrated WBS, each department develops its own WBS to match its viewpoint on the\njob to be carried out. From a whole organisation point of view, the highest level of the WBS thus\nconsists of those of engineering, manufacturing and installation. In this way, the WBS is\neffectively taking a functional point of view using the OBS in the top levels, and the work tasks as\nthe lower level elements. This WBS design is effective for the department carrying out the task, but\nit is difficult to visualise the project as a whole and relate its work elements to the deliverable\nitems. Typically, during the scope definition, three different functional views can be identified:\nengineering design, manufacturing and installation plus the additional view for commercial. The\nWBS is made up of the design, manufacturing and installation tasks and the deliverables are not\nvisible from a customer viewpoint. The commercial view is oriented towards customer identifiable\ndeliverables, as this is the basis to negotiate the project price. As an example, let us consider a\nmodification job that involves the installation of a certain avionics system. The designer could\nstructure the work as the relocation of antennas and integration of the avionics system with the\nexisting system. The installation estimator may just consider the system to be installed together\nwith another avionics system that has to be installed in the same area. This provides the optimum\nbreakdown for the design and installation tasks. However, the commercial manager has to consider\nthe installation of the specific avionics systems separately as it is the viewpoint for him\/her to sell\nor negotiate the price with the customer. In order to make the first two WBS to converge with the\nlast one, the designer has to add the tasks for the antenna design with the integration task to obtain\nthe price in the view of the commercial manager. Also, the installation estimator has to break-down\nhis tasks to ensure that he can attribute the proportional part of the cost to the specific avionics\n19\nsystems. This way of creating the WBS does not provide the best structured view of the project.\nThe authors have developed an integrated WBS for aircraft modification that could be used from\nthe beginning of the scope definition through to the end of the project life cycle. The integrated\nWBS uses typical aircraft modification deliverables as the top level structure. The design,\nmanufacture and installation tasks make up the lower level elements. The system depicted in this\npaper is being implemented into a cost estimating and control system in the collaborating\ncompany. With networked information technology, everyone working on the same project can\nwork to the same WBS, which can be updated as required throughout the project life cycle. The\nsteps for the bid scope definition are as follows:\n\uf0b7 Initial WBS: The bid manager first creates an initial WBS. This is based on the understanding\nof the project collected during the job description activity. Using his experience, the bid manager\nselects the tasks that are required for the project from the integrated WBS. He can then identify if\nany archived information exists from previous similar projects, so that the same elements can be\nselected for the new WBS. The integrated WBS works as a checklist when selecting the different\nWBS elements. The elements selected at this stage are at the higher levels of the WBS. These\nelements are the starting point for the designers and estimators to understand the type of job and\nthe tasks required.\n\uf0b7 WBS definition: Once the initial scope has been created with the initial WBS, the design\nengineers can then work in creating the concept of the technical solution. This solution concept\nprovides more information about the tasks to be carried out. The designers can then define further\ndetails in the WBS. Elements may be added to the initial WBS at the higher levels. As more details\nabout the previously scoped tasks are known, additional sublevels to these ones can be added. The\n20\nWBS provides a project level integrated view for all the different design tasks. After the WBS is\ndefined the design activities are usually broke down to a greater level of detail to manage the\nengineering efforts.\n\uf0b7 WBS update: The update occurs when the technical solution is fully developed. At this point\ndesign information such as schemes, design specification or Statement of Work (SoW) are\navailable. Based on this information the manufacturing and installation estimators can scope the\ntasks required to deliver the design. The estimators add the WBS elements required for\nmanufacturing and installation and specify the lower levels of detail for these activities. They may\nalso identify activities that may have been missed by design. This WBS update mainly includes the\nmanufacturing and installation views of the tasks.\n\uf0b7 WBS contract update: Normally, only the top levels of the WBS are presented to the\ncustomer, unless further decomposition is explicitly asked for. After the bid is submitted, it is\npossible that changes are required during contract negotiations. These changes may be related to\nthe cost, schedule, technical solution, or other factors. If the changes are related to the scope of the\nproject, such as the customer wanting to add new items or dropping some of the existing ones, then\nthe information about the changes have to be reflected to design, manufacturing or installation. The\nprocess of defining the work scope is then repeated to incorporate these changes.\nIt is important to note that there are many iterations before the WBS is stable for the final bid\nproposal. This is because the design and estimation processes are happening concurrently and\ndesign information is being generated while the estimation is going on. The looping of these\nprocesses is dependent on the information available. As more design decisions are made, more\nitems are added or a greater level of detail is defined. The verification and approval of the final\n21\nversion of the WBS happens at the last stages of design and estimation checks and the bid review.\n5.3 Execution scope\nThe bid preparation WBS created at the bid scope definition stage is to support the cost and\nschedule estimating activities. When the contract is awarded, a WBS has to be defined to support\nthe execution of the project. This is the basis for detailed work planning and forms the baseline for\nperformance measurement and control. The tasks defined during the bid proposal are the basis to\ndefine the ones to execute the modification project.\nTo deliver the project to schedule and cost, it is necessary to carry out the planning and budgeting\nof the different activities to the necessary level of detail. A post-contract estimate (the estimate\nafter the contract is awarded) is usually carried out as the first step for budgeting. Based on this\nestimate, the tasks are budgeted and responsibilities are assigned. Although the work package level\nis sufficient for management control, the work scope has to be broken down into lower levels\nduring the manufacturing and installation planning to define the job cards. The definition of the\nexecution WBS can be divided into two stages:\n\uf0b7 Project WBS: The exact modification is determined by the engineering design of the job.\nEngineering design is an expensive, non-recurring activity and has to be carefully controlled.\nDesign activities are planned and budgeted to a low level of detail and the work packages are\ndefined. The WBS for the execution of the project is defined to the same level of detail. The tasks\nin the bid proposal WBS are further broken down and are defined usually to the fifth level of\ndetail. These tasks would include activities such as the creation of specific drawings, with their\nnumbers obtained from the Drawing Control List (DCL).\n22\n\uf0b7 Project WBS update: The estimators use the engineering solution to define the manufacturing\nand installation estimates. The WBS is broken down as more design information is available. This\nbreakdown may or may not be necessary depending on the level of detail completed during bid\npreparation. If the size of the project is large, it is usual to carry out a further decomposition of the\nWBS. If the project had been specified to enough level of detail during bid preparation, as it would\nusually happen with small projects, it may not be necessary to further define the scope of the job.\nOnce the project WBS is defined, the project plan is derived from it. Scheduling and performance\nmanagement is carried out using the baseline WBS. The execution scope and WBS are defined\nwith the additional information and act as a check to ensure that all activities are budgeted for.\nThere may be tasks that are not included in the proposal WBS but identified at this stage. Although\nthe profitability of the project is affected as the price has already been agreed in the contract,\ncorrection actions to minimise the impact can still be taken. If those tasks are not identified until\nthe work is in progress, the opportunities for corrective actions are more limited.\n5.4 Scope control\nThe scope of the project is a critical issue and has to be controlled continuously. It is the nature of\nplanning that projects will deviate from the original plans. These deviations can be in scope, cost or\nschedule and need to be recognised as soon as they occur. Changes in the aircraft modification\nproject can be generated through three different sources: request for engineering modification,\nadditional work either identified by the people executing the work or requested by the customer.\nThe request for engineering modification should not have an effect on the scope of the project as\nthis activity was known, although it may need a budget or schedule change. If the customer\n23\nrequests additional work, then the extra work is estimated, authorised and added to the project\nWBS. In the case when additional work is identified and within the contract boundaries, the scope\nneeds to be changed and the tasks should be included in the WBS and identified as additional tasks.\nSo if there is a similar task in the future it will not be missed. The additional elements of the WBS\nidentified should be included in the WBS at the level that corresponds to that task.\n5.5 Scope analysis\nThe final stage in the scope life cycle is the analysis that is carried out at the end of the project. The\nWBS used in the bid, the project baseline scope and the final scope of the project are compared and\nthe reasons for the changes, if any, analysed and documented. Recommendations may be suggested\nfor activities of the scope or alternative tasks. The customer acceptance of the work carried out is\nalso part of this process.\n6 The integrated WBS\nAs it has been highlighted in the previous sections of the paper, the construction of a project WBS\ndepends on many different factors. Different views and requirements at different project stages by\ndifferent people will produce different WBS\u2019s. The optimal WBS representation for one purpose\nmay create inefficiencies for other uses. The integrated WBS developed by the authors contains the\nelements that are required by the different perspectives in an aircraft modification project. The fact\nthat different individuals with the same background, or furthermore the same individual depending\non the circumstances, will construct the WBS in different ways is a problem for knowledge reuse.\nThe diverse nature of the aircraft modification business with so many uncertainties and varieties\nmakes it difficult to create a structured approach to manage projects and the WBS. The integrated\n24\nWBS has been designed as a template that can be used in any type of aircraft modification project.\nThe concept of the integrated WBS is that the top levels of the WBS are fixed elements selected\nfrom a generic aircraft modification project template. The lower elements are then introduced for\nthe different stakeholders of the project. Thus there are two sections in the structure. A rigid part at\nthe top and a flexible one attached to the bottom that is specific to each project (Figure 3). In this\nway, the holistic view of the project is represented by the rigid part of the WBS which provides the\ncomplete picture of the project. This part also provides the basis for knowledge reuse. Information\ncan be attached to the different elements of the WBS. When a project in the future requires an\nelement of the WBS, it is possible to retrieve the information that is stored from previous projects\nunder that same element. This information can then be analysed and extrapolated to the new\nproject.\nThe elements of the WBS have been defined in the WBS dictionary to be used by all the people in\nthe organisation. This dictionary also contains a numbering system to uniquely identify each\nelement. The top elements of the integrated WBS are presented in Figure 4.\nInformation across the organisation can then be shared through the use of the WBS. Cost, schedule\nand technical information can be attached to the different elements of the WBS. In this way people\ncan better understand the work that other people are doing and the constraints that they have,\ntherefore improve communication and maintain the complete scope of the project. For example a\ndrawing location or a schedule can be attached to the WBS element to which it belongs. An\nestimator can then access this information by going to the WBS element.\n25\nThe integrated WBS has two integrative functions. The WBS has been developed in an integrative\nmanner with the views of people from different departments collated, integrated and agreed. The\nsecond integration is its design to be used in all the activities across the complete life cycle process\nof the aircraft modification project.\n7 Conclusion\nAircraft modification business covers a wide variety of project types. Many uncertainties are\nassociated to this business. It is therefore essential to reuse as much information as possible to plan\nfor and manage these uncertainties in projects. The WBS defines the scope of an aircraft\nmodification project. Identifying the right scope of a project is essential as it can have a significant\nprofit impact if is not done correctly. The WBS is also the backbone to attach information such as\ncost and schedules for project planning and control. The different views and perceptions of the job\nby the different stakeholders make it difficult to have a holistic view of the project and to reuse\ninformation. The WBS is also dynamic and it evolves during the project changing to meet the\nneeds of the people involved.\nThis paper has contributed to understand the dynamic nature of the WBS through a project life\ncycle. A concurrent engineering approach for information generation and sharing has been taken\nand an agreed integrated WBS has been developed that incorporates the different views and needs\nof the people involved in an aircraft modification project. This integrated WBS has also been\ndesigned to fulfil the changing information availability of the different stages of the project life\ncycle. The integrated WBS concept provides the base for the integration of views, while it offers\n26\nthe possibility to develop the different views required in a project by the use of the lower flexible\npart of the integrated WBS.\nThe integrated WBS has been implemented in a networked computing system that can be used\nsimultaneously across the collaborating company and ensures that everybody is working according\nto the same scope at any point in time and provides visibility of the different tasks of the project.\n8 Acknowledgement\nThis research has been carried out within the EPSRC IMI Aerospace project GR\/M43470 DREAM\n(Defining knowledge models for reconfiguration and modification processes in aerospace).
