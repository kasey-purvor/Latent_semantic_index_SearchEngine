Resveratrol can also retard parameters \nlinked to aging and acts as a calorie restriction-mimetic in mice (3,4), \nimportant findings in the light of emerging evidence of a possible association \nbetween calorie restriction and anticarcinogenesis (5). The abundance of \ninformation on biochemical effects of resveratrol in cultured cells potentially \nlinked to anticarcinogenesis (6) contrasts with a scarcity of studies in humans. \nPublished human studies typically employed single doses of up to 25mg \nresveratrol, mostly as a constituent of wine, grape fruit juice or grape extract \n(7). Reports on trials of resveratrol in humans after single (8,9) or multiple \ndaily doses of up to 600 mg per day administered over two or three days \n(10,11) suggest that it is safe under the tested conditions. Pharmacodynamic \nproperties of resveratrol after repeated dosing in humans have hitherto not \nbeen described. \nThe insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signalling system, which consists of \nIGFs, IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs) and IGF receptors, crucially influences \nmalignant development. IGFs possess potent antiapoptotic and mitogenic \nproperties (12,13) and affect cell differentiation, neoplastic transformation and \nmetastasis (13-15). The IGF system is regulated by IGFBPs, prominently \nIGFBP-3, which bind IGFs in the extracellular milieu with high affinity and \nspecificity, thus reducing circulating levels of IGFs. Several studies suggest a \ndirect relationship between levels of IGF-1, and an inverse relationship \nbetween levels of IGFBP-3, and risk of colorectal, prostate, breast or lung \n4 \n \ncancer (16). Individuals suffering from acromegaly, a somatic disease \nassociated with increased IGF-1, have an elevated risk of colorectal cancer \n(17). IGF-1 has also been suggested to contribute to the development of \nadenomatous polyps (18). The anti-carcinogenic activity of dietary restriction \nin preclinical models of carcinogenicity is thought to be mediated, at least in \npart, via reduction of circulating IGF-1 (19). Modulation of the IGF system has \nbeen proposed as a mechanism by which certain agents, for example 9-cis-\nretinoic acid, may prevent cancer (20). Resveratrol lowered circulating IGF-1 \nin diabetic mice on a high calorie diet (3) and in prostate tumor tissue of \nTRAMP mice (21), a genetic model of prostate carcinogenesis. Information on \nthe effect of resveratrol on IGFBP-3 has not been provided in these two \nstudies.  \nThe potential of resveratrol as a cancer chemopreventive agent and\/or \ncalorie restriction mimetic in humans is a topic of considerable interest (2,5), \nbut potential biomarkers of its efficacy, such as levels of components of the \nIGF signalling pathway, in humans are virtually unknown. We conducted a \ntrial of repeat high dose resveratrol in healthy volunteers with the aim to \nexplore its safety, the pharmacokinetics of parent agent and its major \nmetabolites and the effect of resveratrol on circulating levels of IGF-1 and \nIGFBP-3.     \n \n \n \n \n \n5 \n \nMaterials and Methods \nVolunteers \nHealthy volunteers (55% male, 65% Caucasian, 15% Asian, 12.5% \nAfro-Caribbean or biracial, 7.5% Hispanic) were recruited into the study at \neither the Universities of Leicester (UK) or Michigan (USA) and gave written \ninformed consent. Eligibility criteria included willingness to abstain from \ningestion of large quantities of resveratrol-containing foods. Exclusion criteria \nincluded chronic medications including vitamins (except for oral or depot \ncontraceptives and hormone replacement therapy). The study is registered at \nClinicalTrials.gov (website address: http:\/\/www.clinicaltrials.gov) as NCT \n00098969. It was reviewed and approved by the Leicestershire, \nNorthamptonshire & Rutland Research Ethics Committee (UK) and the \nUniversity of Michigan Institutional Review Board (IRBMED, US) and \nconducted in accordance with the applicable guidelines on Good Clinical \nPractice. At the pre-dosing screening visit, the volunteer\u2019s medical history was \nrecorded including regular\/occasional use of medication and vitamins. Four \nsubjects, who terminated intervention prematurely, were replaced, so that \noverall 40 individuals, 10 per dose level, completed the intervention. Mean \nand range (in brackets) of ages and body mass indices for the 4 different \ndosing groups were as follows: Age (in years): 0.5g: 35 (20-49), 1.0g: 36 (20-\n58), 2.5g: 37 (24-51), 5.0g: 42 (21-73); body mass index (in kg\/m2): 0.5g: 27.5 \n(20.0-42.4), 1.0g: 25.2 (18.6-39.4), 2.5g: 26.3 (19.3-39.0), 5.0g: 25.4 (19.2-\n32.8). The values did not differ significantly between dose groups. \n \n \n6 \n \nStudy design and resveratrol dose  \nStudy participants ingested uncoated immediate-release caplets \nmanufactured to GMP standards by Pharmascience Inc, Montreal, Quebec \n(Canada). Caplets contained 500mg chemically synthesized resveratrol. The \nstability of the formulation was tested according to GMP stipulations. \nParticipants were recruited sequentially to 4 dose levels of resveratrol (0.5, \n1.0, 2.5 and 5.0g) and instructed to ingest the appropriate dose between 7 \nand 9 am daily for 29 days. Participants completed a form after each dose \nand were evaluated for adverse events and compliance with dosing on a \nweekly basis. An adverse event according to the National Cancer Institute \nCommon Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 was \nattributed to resveratrol by the site study team on the basis of detailed \ndescription of symptoms, their duration and other pertinent factors \n(medication, food intake). Volunteers were recruited to the next dose level \nwhen absence of unacceptable toxicity in the final participant on the previous \ndose level had been established within a 14-day waiting period.  \n  \nSample preparation and HPLC analysis  \nBlood samples for PK analysis of resveratrol and its metabolites were \ncollected prior to resveratrol administration (pre-dose) on day 1 and at pre-\ndose and 0.25, 1.0, 1.5, 5, 12 and 24h post-dose on a day between the 21st \nand the 28th day of dosing. Blood samples were collected into lithium \nheparinized tubes from which plasma was obtained and stored at -800C until \nanalysis.  \n7 \n \nSample preparation, which entailed extraction of acidified plasma with \nmethanol, and HPLC-UV analysis for quantification of resveratrol and its \nmetabolites were performed as described previously (9, 22). Separation was \nachieved on a Waters Atlantis C18 column (4.6mmx150mm 3\u00b5m, Waters, \nElstree, UK) in combination with a Waters Atlantic C18 guard column \n(4.6mmx20mm, 3\u00b5m). Quantitation of resveratrol using a gradient HPLC-UV \nsystem (Waters Alliance 2695; Waters Corp., Manchester, UK) was \nperformed as described before, and the method has been validated in terms \nof inter- and intra-day variability, recovery, accuracy and precision (22). The \nretention time of resveratrol was 18.6min, its lower limit of detection 5ng\/mL. \nAs authentic resveratrol metabolites were not available in sufficient quantities \nas reference materials, metabolite amounts were calculated as \u201cresveratrol \nequivalents\u201d, on the assumption that recovery characteristics and relationship \nbetween peak area ratio and concentration were the same as for parent \nresveratrol. Authentic resveratrol-3-O-sulfate (also provided by \nPharmascience, Montreal), resveratrol-4'-O-sulfate, resveratrol-3-O-\nglucuronide and resveratrol-4'-O-glucuronide became available during the \ncourse of the study by in-house synthesis, permitting HPLC peak \nidentification, so that resveratrol metabolites could be identified by co-\nchromatography. Metabolite identity was confirmed by liquid chromatography-\ntandem mass spectrometry (LC\/MS\/MS) with selected reaction monitoring \n(SRM), operated in negative ion mode using an Agilent 1100 series HPLC \nwith in-line Applied Biosystems\/MDS SCIEX API 2000 ion spray triple \nquadrupole mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) under \nchromatographic conditions described previously (9, 22). Definitive isomer \n8 \n \nidentification was not possible for resveratrol disulfate and resveratrol sulfate \nglucuronide.  \n \nDetermination of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 \nBlood samples to assay IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 were obtained, following \novernight fasting, before the first dose and before the last dose of resveratrol \non day 29, or in the case of three individuals on days 30 or 31, who ingested \nresveratrol for the additional day or two. IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 concentrations in \nserum were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) \nkits DG100 and BAF675, respectively (R&D Systems, Oxon, UK), with pre- \nand post-dosing samples from each person analysed on the same 96 well \nplate. Assays for both species were performed in parallel, and serum samples \nwere analyzed in triplicate, standards in duplicate. The IGF-1 assay includes a \nstep which releases IGF-1 from binding proteins. Assays were performed \naccording to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and blinded with respect to \nsubject. Samples were stable over the period elapsing between collection of \npre and post dose blood when stored at -80\u00b0C, as illustrated by comparing \nsamples analyzed fresh and after 3 months storage, which showed a variation \nof <5%. \n \nPharmacokinetic parameters \nThe following pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated for \nresveratrol and its metabolites using a non-compartmental approach: Cmax= \nmaximal plasma concentration over the collection period; Cav= average \nplasma concentration over the collection period; Tmax= time of Cmax; T\u00bd= \n9 \n \napparent first-order elimination half-life calculated as ln(2)\/\u03bbz (\u03bbz = apparent \nfirst order elimination constant calculated from semi-log plot of plasma \nconcentration vs time curve); AUClast = area under the plasma concentration \nversus time curve from time 0 to the last measurable concentration above the \nlimit of quantitation, as calculated by the linear trapezoidal method. Apparent \ntotal body clearance (CL\/F) and apparent volume of distribution (V\/F) for \nresveratrol were calculated as dose\/AUC and dose\/(\u03bbzxAUC), respectively. \n \nStatistical analysis \n Descriptive statistics (mean, SD, coefficient of variation [CV], median) \nwere calculated for plasma concentrations of resveratrol and its metabolites. \nGeometric mean and CV values were calculated for concentrations and \nderived pharmacokinetic parameters using R v.2.9.2 (open source \nimplementation of S statistical programming language, Bell Laboratories, \nMurray Hill, NJ) on MS Windows and Linux. The proportionality between Cmax \nor AUC and dose for resveratrol was evaluated using the power model and \nconfidence interval approaches as described by Chow and Liu (23) omitting \nresults for the 0.5g dose, as many of the plasma concentration values at this \ndose were near or below the limit of quantitation. \nDifferences between pre- and post-intervention IGF protein levels in \nstudy volunteers (pre- minus post-intervention level) were subjected to \nstatistical evaluation using Student\u2019s paired t test with the \u201cStatistical Package \nfor the Social Sciences\u201d (SPSS) software. The test compares the mean of the \ndifferences between pre- and post-intervention values with zero; P values \n10 \n \nbelow 0.05 indicate that the difference between pre- and post-intervention \nvalues was significantly different from zero. \n \nResults \nSafety of resveratrol \nHealthy volunteers received resveratrol daily for 29 days at daily doses \nof 0.5, 1.0, 2.5 or 5.0g. Resveratrol was safe, as borne out by the lack of \nserious adverse reactions detected by clinical, biochemical or hematological \nanalyses during the study and study follow-up. Of the in total 44 volunteers \nwho received resveratrol, including those who terminated the intervention  \nprematurely, 28 reported one or more adverse events whilst on study. Seven \nof these individuals were on the 0.5g, four on the 1.0g, eight on the 2.5g and \nnine on the 5.0g doses. Table 1 describes the nature of only those adverse \nevents deemed to be possibly or probably associated with resveratrol intake. \nThe majority of events reported by the volunteers on the two highest dose \nlevels (2.5 and 5.0g) were gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, \nflatulence, abdominal discomfort and diarrhoea. Most of these events were \nmild (severity grade 1, NCI CTCAE v.4.0), although 4 participants on the 2.5g \nand 5.0g doses presented with nausea and\/or diarrhoea of moderate severity \n(grade 2). The gastrointestinal side effects commenced after 2-4 days of the \nintervention and occurred half to one hour after resveratrol ingestion. \nSymptoms, which tended to improve throughout the day and return after the \nfollowing dose, resolved within 2 days of completing the 29-day course. There \nwas no weight loss in any participant, and all volunteers maintained normal \nperformance status throughout the study period.  \n11 \n \nPharmacokinetics of resveratrol and its metabolites \nPlasma from 40 volunteers was collected at multiple time points after \nresveratrol ingestion on a day between the 21st and the 28th day of \nintervention, and analyzed for presence of parent agent and metabolites. As \nreported before in volunteers after a single dose of resveratrol (9), parent \nresveratrol and six metabolic conjugates, resveratrol-3-O-sulfate, resveratrol-\n4'-O-sulfate, resveratrol disulfate, resveratrol-3-O-glucuronide, resveratrol-4'-\nO-glucuronide and a resveratrol sulfate glucuronide, were identified by HPLC-\nUV co-chromatography with authentic reference material and\/or HPLC-\ntandem mass spectrometry in volunteers\u2019 plasma (result not shown). The \nmost abundant circulating resveratrol metabolite was resveratrol-3-O-sulfate.  \nPlasma concentrations of resveratrol and its three major metabolites \nresveratrol-3-O-sulfate, resveratrol-4'-O-glucuronide and resveratrol-3-O-\nglucuronide were measured by HPLC-UV, and plasma concentration versus \ntime curves are shown in Fig. 1. Pharmacokinetic parameters derived from \nthese plots are summarized in Table 2. Resveratrol was rapidly absorbed \nyielding peak concentrations (Cmax) at 1h post-dose. The mean average \nplasma concentration (Cav) and Cmax values of parent resveratrol across the \nfour dose levels ranged from 0.04 to 0.55nmol\/mL and 0.19 to 4.24nmol\/mL, \nrespectively. The corresponding concentrations of the major resveratrol \nconjugates exceeded those of their parent molecule by factors of between 3.8 \nand 16.5 for Cav and between 2.4 and 12.9 for Cmax. Of the metabolites, \nresveratrol-3-O-sulfate displayed the greatest Cav and Cmax values, ranging \nfrom 0.5 to 6.1nmol\/mL and from 2.5 to 18.3nmol\/mL, respectively, across the \n4 doses. The plasma elimination half-lives varied between 4.77 and 9.70h for \n12 \n \nresveratrol and between 3.09 and 8.14h for the major metabolites. The mean \nvalues for the areas under the plasma concentration versus time curve \n(AUClast) for resveratrol were 175ngxh\/mL at the lowest, and 4097ngxh\/mL at \nthe highest dose. The respective AUClast values at these doses for \nresveratrol-3-O-sulfate were 20.3- and 9.49-fold higher, those for resveratrol-\n4'-O-glucuronide 7.61- and 4.88-fold higher, and those for resveratrol-3-O-\nglucuronide 5.00- and 5.39-fold higher, than the AUCs for resveratrol (Table \n2). The apparent total body clearances and apparent volumes of distribution \nfor resveratrol are consistent with its rapid metabolism and low bioavailability \n(Table 3). When plotted versus dose, mean Cmax and AUC values for \nresveratrol and its metabolites increased with dose in a manner grossly \nproportional to dose (Fig. 2). This relationship was analyzed statistically (23) \nfor parent resveratrol, and the analysis supported dose proportionality for Cmax \nand AUC at the 1.0 to 5.0 g dose levels.  \n \nEffect of resveratrol on circulating IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 \n IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels in plasma samples obtained on day 29 were \ncompared with those taken just prior to the first dose of resveratrol. \nConsumption of resveratrol reduced IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels weakly, albeit \nsignificantly, when results from all trial participants were combined. Mean \ndifferences between pre- and post-intervention levels, 95% confidence \nintervals (both in ng\/mL) and P values emanating from the paired t-test were \n8.1(0.7-15.4), P=0.04 for IGF-1 and 109 (10-208), P=0.04 for IGFBP-3. Fig. 3 \nshows the effect of resveratrol on circulating levels of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 in \nthe individual volunteers. In those on the 2.5g dose, levels of IGF-1 were most \n13 \n \nprominently and consistently reduced (Fig. 3), with a difference between pre- \nand post-intervention IGF-1 levels (in ng\/mL) of 29.6 (95% confidence interval \n21.5-37.8, P<0.001). IGF-1 levels were not significantly affected in volunteers \non the 0.5 or 1.0g doses. Mean IGFBP-3 concentrations in individuals on 1.0 \nor 2.5g resveratrol were also significantly reduced by resveratrol. The \ndifferences between pre- and post intervention IGFBP-3 levels with 95% \nconfidence intervals (both in ng\/mL) and P values were 279 (62\u2013496, P=0.03) \nfor the 1.0g dose and 210 (49\u2013372, P=0.03) for the 2.5g dose (Fig. 3). The \nratio IGF-1\/IGFBP-3 for the 2.5g dose cohort was also strongly reduced (not \nshown). At 5g, resveratrol failed to affect the IGF system significantly.  \n \nDiscussion \nIn this report we describe the pharmacokinetics of resveratrol after \nrepeated oral administration of high doses and define potential \npharmacodynamic endpoints pertinent to optimise future long-term \nintervention studies of resveratrol. Doses of up to 5g given daily for 29 days \nwere safe, although the two highest doses used here (2.5 and 5g) caused \ngastrointestinal symptoms of mild to moderate severity. On the basis of these \nfindings we would tentatively recommend that in future intervention studies of \nresveratrol the daily dose should perhaps not exceed 1.0g. The highest dose \ngenerated circulating peak levels of parent agent which approached \nconcentrations reported to cause pharmacological activity in cells in vitro (24). \nCirculating levels of its major metabolites, resveratrol-3-O-sulfate, resveratrol-\n4'-O-glucuronide and resveratrol-3-O-glucuronide, were much higher, in the \ncase of the sulfate the highest dose yielded a mean Cmax of 18.3\u00b5M. These \n14 \n \nresults are important in the light of the suspicion that resveratrol metabolites \nmay contribute to the pharmacological activity of the parent agent (2). \nExperimental evidence to support this notion is scarce, but recent publications \nsuggests that resveratrol sulfate conjugates can induce quinone reductase \nand inhibit cyclooxygenase enzymes, nitric oxide production and NF\u03baB \ninduction in cells in vitro (25,26). It is not known whether resveratrol \nmetabolites can engage estrogenic effects, a property which the parent agent \nis suspected to possess (27), although this notion has been disputed (28). \nWhilst the Cmax and AUC values described here for resveratrol and its \nmetabolites after multiple resveratrol doses are similar to those reported \npreviously after single dose resveratrol at levels identical to those used here \n(9), there are subtle differences (Fig. 4). In the case of the 0.5g dose, the Cmax \nvalues for resveratrol-3-O-sulfate and the two monoglucuronides after repeat \nresveratrol were 50 to 60% of those after a single dose, consistent with \nmultiple administration of resveratrol at this dose causing inhibition of its \nmetabolic conjugation or augmentation of metabolite elimination. In contrast, \nafter the 5g dose, the Cmax values for parent resveratrol and the two \nresveratrol glucuronides after multiple dosing were approximately double \nthose after single dose resveratrol, indicative of accumulation of parent and \nglucuronides. After multiple administration of the 5g dose, the AUC values for \nresveratrol and its metabolites were higher than those observed after single \ndosing, however these differences did not reach significance levels (result not \nshown). Although the design of the study does not allow delineation of steady \nstate, it is conceivable that steady state was achieved. Given that the time to \nsteady state is 3-5 half-lives, and the half-life of resveratrol administered once \n15 \n \ndaily was 4.8-9.7h, approximately 15h to 2 days would be required to attain \nsteady-state. It needs to be stressed that the dosing regime was not optimized \nin this study, and a shorter dosing interval might have been used to increase \nthe steady state concentrations and maintain levels within a narrower range. \nLikewise, sustained release formulations of resveratrol might possess \npharmacokinetic properties superior to those of the caplet formulation used in \nthis study. However it is pertinent to point out that in a recent phase 1 study in \ncolorectal cancer patients who ingested 0.5 or 1.0g of the same resveratrol \nformulation used here daily for 7 days, resveratrol was still present at \nconcentrations of between 8.3 and 674nmol\/g tissue in surgically resected \ncolon tissue beyond ~6 h after the last dose (29). This means that for \nprevention of colorectal malignancies by resveratrol the once-daily dosing \nschedule used in the present investigation might well be sufficient.  \n The results suggest that repeated consumption of resveratrol may \ndecrease circulating levels of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3. These observations render \nIGF proteins potential biomarkers of pharmacological activity of resveratrol in \nhumans. The reduction of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 by resveratrol did not follow a \nlinear dose-response relationship at the dose range tested here. Whilst the \neffect of resveratrol was not significant at the lowest (0.5g) or highest (5.0g) \ndoses, significant decreases were observed at the medium dose of 2.5g. \nUnconventional dose\u2013pharmacological response relationships have been \ndescribed for resveratrol before. For example, in a murine model of aorta \nrepair in vivo, resveratrol at 10mg\/kg increased both endothelial nitric oxide \nsynthase expression in injured arteries and the number of endothelial \nprogenitor cells in the circulation, whilst such responses were not elicited by \n16 \n \n50 mg\/kg (30). It needs to be emphasized that the current study only hints at \nthe possibility that high-dose resveratrol can depress circulating levels of IGF \nproteins, and these observations need to be corroborated in long-term studies \nwith larger numbers of participants. If IGF protein modulation is indeed found \nto be a genuine property of resveratrol, its consumption for years - rather than \nweeks - may profoundly affect IGF axis signalling. The findings reported here \nfor resveratrol have to be interpreted in the light of the importance of the IGF \nsystem for the development of malignancies. High levels of IGF-1 have been \ncausally associated with risk of several cancers (16), so that the ability to \ndecrease IGF-1, which we have shown here may be achieved in humans by \nresveratrol, constitutes an anti-carcinogenic mechanism. Intervention with 9-\ncis-retinoic acid for 3 months decreased circulating IGF-1 in former smokers \n(20). Reduction in IGF-1 is often the corollary of elevation of IGFBP-3 \nconcentrations, which sequester IGF-1 and decrease its bioavailability and \nthus its interaction with IGF receptors by which it engages mitogenic and anti-\napoptotic actions. The results presented here show that exposure to \nresveratrol did not elevate IGFBP-3 levels in humans, rather there was some \nreduction. It is difficult to interpret this finding in terms of contribution to the \nmechanisms by which resveratrol may exert chemoprevention. Circulating \nlevels of IGFBP-3 are now thought to be directly associated with an increased \nrisk of common cancers, albeit associations are modest and vary between \nsites (31,32). On the basis of these insights one may argue that the \nresveratrol-induced decrease in circulating IGFBP-3, like the decrease in IGF-\n1, may constitute an anti-carcinogenic event. \n17 \n \n Importantly, ingestion of resveratrol for 29 days did neither significantly \naffect circulating levels of prostaglandin E-2 (PGE-2), reflecting perturbation of \nthe arachidonic acid cascade, nor influence leukocyte levels of the \nmalondialdehyde-DNA adduct M1dG, reflecting DNA oxidation, in a plausible \nand consistent fashion (results not shown). Effects of resveratrol on levels of \nIGF-1, IGFBP-3, PGE-2 or M1dG in individuals were not correlated with any of \nthe pharmacokinetic parameters. \n In summary, resveratrol has been shown here to be safe after 29 daily \ndoses of 0.5 to 5g. There was a hint of pharmacodynamic activity in terms of \neffect on circulating IGF protein levels at the 2.5g dose level, which \nengendered a mean plasma peak level of 1.45\u00b5M. Future studies should \nestablish whether resveratrol can modulate the IGF axis also when given for \nperiods exceeding 29 days at doses below those eliciting gastrointestinal \nsymptoms, and elucidate mechanisms involved. Resveratrol is representative \nof a group of diet-derived putative cancer chemopreventive agents \nencompassing, among others, curcumin, tea polyphenols and apigenin, which \nhave attracted a lot of interest in the cancer chemoprevention community. The \ninterest stems from the fact that these agents can engage a plethora of \nintriguing anticarcinogenic mechanisms in cellular studies in vitro, although \nhardly any of these processes have hitherto been explored as potential \nefficacy biomarkers in humans. The indication described here that resveratrol \naffects the IGF axis hints at the possibility that IGF-1 and\/or IGFBP-3 may \nserve as potential markers of chemopreventive efficacy when these dietary \nagents are eventually evaluated in definitive clinical chemoprevention studies.  \nUT \n18 \n \nDisclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interests \nTDB and GP are employees of Pharmascience Inc.
