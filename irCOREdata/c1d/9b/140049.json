However, recent research\nhas indicated that, for many organisations, a high proportion of customers is unprofitable.\nThis raises a question about the retention proposition. Increasing the retention of unprofitable\ncustomers may be damaging, not beneficial, to organisations. This paper discusses some\ncommon data analysis techniques used to identify the most and least profitable customers so\nthat marketing managers can develop effective, appropriately targeted customer management\nstrategies.\nKey words: customer profitability, data mining, customer risk, relationship marketing.\nRelationship Marketing: the value of Lifetime Relationships with Customers\nThe emergence of Relationship Marketing has seen an increased emphasis on customer\nretention1,2 Influential voices have insisted that the relationship with the customer is a\nfundamental driver of business success and that companies need to trade-off their investment\nin creating value for customers with the shareholder value that those customer relationships\ncreate for the company.3 What is, or has become, controversial is the role that customer\nretention may play in the creation of shareholder value.\nOne reason that this is a contentious topic is the growing criticism of marketing for its lack of\nmeasurement and, by implication, of tangible returns. In particular, an undue emphasis on\ncustomer satisfaction may result in strategies that do nothing to generate shareholder value.4\nDoyle and others5 argue that the key role of marketing is to create shareholder value.\nTargeted marketing and relationship management have an important role to play in creating\nshareholder value6, 7\nThe early position of Relationship Marketing was to argue that increasing overall customer\nretention will improve corporate performance.8 This position was exemplified by Reichheld\u2019s\nmuch-cited 1996 book with its statistics for the impact of a 5% increase in customer retention\non the lifetime value of those customers.9 In Reichheld\u2019s examples, the reason that customer\nretention increases customer lifetime value is because customer acquisition costs are high,\nmaking new customers unprofitable, whereas there are underlying profits from these\ncustomers in future years. Therefore, increasing customer retention will allow these\ncustomers to mature into profitability; as Reichheld says:\n\u201cIn most businesses, the profit earned from each individual customer grows as the customer\nstays with the company\u201d (10p.37).\n2If customers are profitable once acquisition costs are disregarded then it is a truism that\nincreasing customer retention will increase customer lifetime value. Adding an extra year of\nprofit to the lifetime value of a customer will of course increase the lifetime value of that\ncustomer. Unfortunately, there is a growing body of research showing that a high proportion\nof customers are unprofitable and the reasons are not to do with customer acquisition costs.11,\n12,13 These customers are unprofitable because the company\u2019s cost of servicing them is too\nhigh or the prices that it charges are too low, or both.14,15,16,17 No amount of increased\nretention will make these customers profitable; in fact, increasing the retention of\nunprofitable customers may actually destroy shareholder value. This more recent research\ndemonstrates that Reichheld errs in recommending retention across the board; the real\npayback is in targeting marketing efforts to attracting and retaining those customers who are\nmore profitable.18\nThis paper argues that, to be effective at creating value for the company, relationship\nmanagement must focus on attracting and retaining those customers that are most profitable\nfor the organisation. So relationship management has three objectives: to develop strategies\nthat increase customer value and, hence, satisfaction; to identify the most valuable customers\nor segments and target them successfully with retention strategies; and to reduce the risk that\nvaluable customers defect to competitors. In all three objectives, customer information is key.\nThis is where the magic of data mining comes in.\nMagic trick 1: Finding the penny behind the ear - Identifying the sources of customer\nvalue\nThe first task for relationship management is to identify offers that create value for\ncustomers. One technique for identifying what customers really want is cross-buying\nanalysis. Cross-buying analysis identifies which products or services tend to be bought\ntogether.19 A simple form of cross-buying analysis is cross tabulation (\u2018cross tabs\u2019). Cross\ntabs can be used to analyse purchase data from groups of like customers to search for\npurchasing patterns that may suggest new strategies. One application of cross tabs is in\ndeveloping promotions. Cross tabs can suggest what offers may be more likely to succeed\nwith certain customer groups, thereby increasing multiple product holding which is known to\nbe linked with customer retention.20 Knowing what combinations of products customers are\nmore likely to buy can also prevent companies discontinuing products with low sales that are\nan important part of the purchasing mix from the customer\u2019s point of view. This can be\nparticularly important when combined with customer lifetime value analysis: one\nsupermarket that was considering dropping an expensive, low sales cheese found that many\nof its most profitable customers bought the product. It might well be that the exclusive cheese\nwas an important reason for these valuable shoppers to shop there; more research would be\nneeded to ensure that dropping this product line would not jeopardise the entire relationship.\nA step on from cross tabs is collaborative filtering. The premise underlying collaborative\nfiltering is that customers who have similar purchasing patterns will share similar tastes.\nThus, if one customer starts buying a new product, it is likely that other customers with\nsimilar previous purchasing patterns will also be attracted to the new product. Perhaps the\nmost well-known user of collaborative filters is Amazon (\u201cOther customers who bought this\nproduct also bought\u2026.\u201d).\n3Another powerful way in which customer information can be mined to help develop CRM\nstrategies uses a combination of trade-off and cluster analysis. Trade-off analysis is a form of\nanalysis that has its origins in mathematical psychology.21 The idea is that purchasers have to\nmake trade-offs in their purchasing decisions between the availability and the cost of certain\nproduct or service offerings. The results of a trade-off exercise allow managers to identify\nwhere there are clusters of customer preferences around certain combinations of factors.22\nThese can be used as the basis for developing value propositions and tailored relationship\nstrategies for customer segments.\nThe marketing managers for a direct insurance company had always believed that motor\ninsurance was sold overwhelmingly on price. In fact, their trade-off exercise revealed that the\npurely price-sensitive segment comprised just 14% of the customer base. Using customer\ndata the insurer profiled this so-called \u2018Economy\u2019 segment and found that customers in this\nsegment were willing to buy other products, resulting in a cross-selling programme. A large\nsegment of \u2018Security Seekers\u2019 revealed by the analysis preferred to buy from a reputable\ncompany which had been recommended to them; this finding led to brand advertising in\ntargeted publications, and member-get-member promotions to increase positive word of\nmouth.23\nMagic trick 2: Vanishing and reappearing customers \u2013 predicting customer relationship\nlifetimes and defection probabilities\nHenry Ford may have thought that history was bunk but, for most organisations, the history\nof a customer relationship is the best guideline to its future. This principle applies not only to\npurchasing behaviour but also to customer relationship lifetimes. Reasonable estimates of a\ncustomer relationship lifetime can be obtained from data analysis. Grouping customers\naccording to their length of relationship lifetime and then cross-analysing the results by\ncustomer profile may reveal indicators of long (or short) relationship lifetimes. One bank, for\nexample, found that although younger customers had theoretically longer relationship\nlifetimes they were, in fact, more likely to defect so that certain older customers had longer\nactual relationship lifetimes.24 Information about which customers are most likely to vanish\nearly can be used to calculate the net present value of customer acquisition campaigns.\nA problem that has received far less attention than it merits is that of calculating the\nrelationship lifetime of customers who vanish and then reappear, sometimes months or years\nlater. A personal loans organisation suspected that it had customers who might take out a loan\nfor a car, perhaps, and then return months or years later to take out another loan when they\nwanted to change their car again. Unfortunately, the loan company identified loans by the\nloan number, not by customer, so returning customers were issued with a new loan number\nand treated as though they had never before done business with the company. Data managers\nused a sophisticated tool, fuzzy logic, to deal with this problem. Fuzzy logic works by\nmatching qualitative concepts (such as \u2018young, female\u2019) and language concepts (such as\nslightly differently spelled names that are in fact the same person) and indicating how\nprobable it is that a match has been found. The loan company discovered that many of its\ncustomers did apparently return for additional loans, making them substantially more\nvaluable than one-time customers. The fuzzy matching process identified one customer who\nhad taken out no fewer than nine loans over the course of her relationship lifetime with this\norganisation, each loan larger and hence more profitable than the one before! 25 This\n4demonstrated to the personal loans organisation that its current method of calculating\ncustomer lifetime value based purely on existing product holdings was inaccurate. An\nadditional implication was that it was worth keeping customer details on the database for\nlonger and trying to match them to incoming \u2018new\u2019 customers; in this way, the service to\nreturning customers could be improved. Finally, it would be possible to profile the returning\ncustomers and compare their characteristics with those of other, similar but non-returning\ncustomers; in this way, the company would be able to spot higher-potential customers earlier\nand ensure that the received follow-up loan offers.\nCustomers also vanish because they are dissatisfied or attracted by the offer of a competitor.\nThe magic of data mining can identify customer behaviour patterns that warn of imminent\ndefection. Using a technique called micro pattern matching, historic data about customers\nwho have defected are compared with a control group of retained customers to identify the\ndistinctive behaviours of the defectors (for example, taking longer to pay their bills; buying\nless often; buying fewer products). Then, the analysis is applied to the existing customer\ndatabase to identify customers with defecting behaviour patterns. Wesleyan Insurance is an\ninnovator in this field. Its customer database is continually searched for patterns of behaviour\nthat indicate that the customer may be considering leaving. These accounts are flagged as \u2018in\ndanger\u2019, and the customer records transferred automatically to a relationship management\nteam tasked to find out what the problem is and to rescue the relationship.26\nMagic trick 3: How many rabbits in the hat? Forecasting Revenues and Costs over the\nRelationship Lifetime\nRevenues and direct product or service costs will depend on the product mix. Selling more\nproducts to existing customers is the first rabbit out of the data mining hat. Best practice\ncompanies are using predictive modelling techniques to help their marketing people forecast\nlikely product mix and purchasing levels at various points in a customer\u2019s lifecycle stage. A\nmajor UK bank uses neural networks to try to identify what products it would expect its\ncustomers to buy at a given stage in their lives; the bank then matches this to the products it\nknows its customers hold. The resulting gaps may mean that the customer does not have\nproducts that they might need or want, which is an immediate opportunity for cross-selling;\nor perhaps that the customer does own these products, but through a competitor. In the latter\ncase the bank may decide to try to win the customer over to its own producti.\nA truly startling finding from recent research has been the impact of indirect costs, the costs\nof serving customers, on the relative profitability of different customers. Some customers are\nfar more expensive to serve than others. One study 27 found that:\n\u201cAt the individual customer level, the service costs vary from 3.6% to 306.5% of revenues,\nand the customer profitability varies from -251.7% to 59.6% of sales revenue.\" (28, p8)\nUsing traditional tools such as activity-based costing to identify indirect costs, customer by\ncustomer, can be an expensive and time-consuming exercise. Even apparently small matters\nsuch as customer-specific packaging can mean extra resources and costs: higher wastage\nrates, the need for specialised warehousing and transport etc. Fortunately, there are IT tools\ni Private conversation between the Marketing Director of this bank and the author.\n5that help companies to collect, analyse and understand the costs of doing business with their\ncustomers. For example, sales time can be estimated, costed and shown against the specific\ncustomer using sales force automation software. New call centre systems may also\nautomatically identify time spent, customer-by-customer.\nCustomer-specific costs can differ significantly between different customers or segments, yet\nmanagers may fail to take these costs into account. The information may be used for pricing\nor to adjust service levels. A high-tech company began to itemise the notional costs of service\nto some of its more costly customers on their monthly statement. Although it continued to\nprovide the service for free, customers\u2019 perception of the value they received was enhanced.\nThe company found that this practice reduced the focus on price during contract renewal\nnegotiations. Zurich London insurance used information about customer-specific costs to\nidentify where account managers were \u2018giving away free\u2019 valuable services. 29\nMagic trick 4: Sawing the Customer [Risk] in half.\nRisk scoring is a standard procedure in the sale of consumer durables such as mobile phones,\nfurniture, household appliances or cars where credit is to be given, as well as in retail\nfinancial services when customers apply for a mortgage, loan or credit card. Risk scoring is\nan effective way of evaluating certain specific types of customer risk, normally the risk of\ndefault. Traditionally, risk scoring has been done on application. However, the risk of the\ncustomer may change dramatically over the course of the relationship. An individual\u2019s ability\nto meet repayments might be dramatically influenced, for example, by a promotion or a\nredundancy. Data manipulation can cut the risk associated with these changes by monitoring\nrisk on an ongoing basis. At least one leading UK bank has developed a dynamic risk\nevaluation process that enables it to view the changing risk of its customers and adjust its risk\nexposure accordingly. Other banks, like Virgin, use their total view of the customer to offer\ncombined current account and mortgage products. Detailed management of individual\ncustomer risk in this way allows Virgin to offer its customers convenient products at very\ncompetitive prices.30 Dynamic risk monitoring is also used by MBNA to adjust its pricing.31\nDiscussion\nThis paper has argued that a key role of marketing is to identify the customers or segments\nwith the greatest value-creating potential and target them successfully with retention\nstrategies to reduce the risk of these high lifetime value customers defecting to competitors.\nThe managerial implications are extremely interesting. Firstly, managers have to recognise\nthat some customers or segments are more valuable than others. Failing to carry out the kind\nof analysis outlined above could lead a company to overvalue certain customers or segments\nand perhaps to invest disproportionate time and resources in them whilst other, more\nprofitable or less risky segments are neglected. Second, companies will do better by learning\nabout their customers through transactional data than through satisfaction surveys that reflect\nattitudes not actual purchasing behaviours.\nThird, managers must understand that there are certain customers who can never create value\nfor that organisation \u2013 in other words, customers that the firm would be better off without, or\nbetter off not attracting in the first place. It can be hard for some organisations to recognise\nthat not all customers are a good thing. Both acquisition and retention activities should be\nfocused on the more valuable customers.\n6The fourth managerial implication concerns risk. New data analysis techniques allow\ncompanies to understand the risk in their customer relationships. All other things being equal,\nif two customers or segments have the same level of expected future returns but one is more\nrisky, the riskier segment will be less valuable to the company. If they understand risk,\nmanagers can develop new strategies to manage it.\nBest practice demands that marketers develop their understanding of new data mining and\nanalysis techniques and use the output to develop marketing strategies creatively to maximise\nshareholder value.\nReferences\n1 Reichheld, F.
