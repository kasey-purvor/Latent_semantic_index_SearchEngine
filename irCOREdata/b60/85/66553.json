Introduction\n[2] The present-day Aegean Sea (Figure 1) is an important\nsource of deep water for the eastern Mediterranean [Lacombe et\nal., 1958; Miller, 1963; Roether et al., 1996; Lascaratos et al.,\n1999]. Aegean Intermediate Water (AEIW) is derived from Levan-\ntine Intermediate Water (LIW), with its source in the Rhodes Gyre.\nAs this travels north along the Turkish Coast, prevailing offshore\nwinds allow upwelling of the intermediate water to the surface\n[Lascaratos, 1989; Yu\u00a8ce, 1995]. In these shallow eastern shelf\nareas the AEIW consequently forms a single uniform water mass\nfrom the surface to the seafloor. As the upwelled AEIW progresses\nnorthward, its salinity continues to increase due to evaporation.\nWinter winds across the Athos Basin (Figure 1) in the far north\nfurther enhance the salinity of AEIW, and this together with winter\ncooling increases its density. This buoyancy loss drives the\nformation of Aegean Deep Water (AEDW) [Bruce and Charnock,\n1965; Burman and Oren, 1970; Theocharis, 1989; Yu\u00a8ce, 1995].\nToday, AEDW settles in the deeper parts of the Aegean Basin,\nbelow 300 m. Traditionally, AEDW formation was considered of\nminor importance to the deep water ventilation of the open eastern\nMediterranean [Wu\u00a8st, 1961]. However, recent studies show that\nspecific (cold) climatic forcing over the Aegean has throughout the\n1990s caused AEDW to replace Adriatic Deep Water (ADW) as\nthe main deep water in the open eastern Mediterranean [Roether et\nal., 1996; Samuel et al., 1999]. The Aegean\u2019s rapid response to\natmospheric forcing makes it an ideal case study for the analysis of\ndeep water formation and its relationship with climatic change.\n[3] Dramatic deep water ventilation changes on longer time-\nscales are also witnessed in the sedimentary record of the Medi-\nterranean by the presence of sapropels. These dark organic-rich\nlayers are found throughout the eastern Mediterranean. Sapropel\nformation is related to slowing down of deep water ventilation in\nresponse to climate related reductions in buoyancy loss [Rossignol-\nStrick et al., 1982; Jenkins and Wiliams, 1983; Rossignol-Strick,\n1983, 1985, 1987; Parisi, 1987; Cramp and Collins, 1988; Cramp\net al., 1988; Perissoratis and Piper, 1992; Rohling, 1994]. These\nreductions are thought to be caused by changes to much wetter\nclimatic conditions at times of increased Northern Hemisphere\ninsolation (precession cycle minima) [Rossignol-Strick et al., 1982;\nRossignol-Strick, 1983, 1985; Rohling and Hilgen, 1991; Hilgen,\n1991; Lourens et al., 1996]. In addition to suppression of deep\nwater production, sapropel formation has also been associated with\nincreases in export productivity [Rohling and Gieskes, 1989; De\nLange et al., 1990; Rohling, 1994; Rohling and Hilgen, 1991;\nThomson et al., 1995; Cramp and O\u2019Sullivan, 1999].\n[4] Modeling of circulation during deposition of the most recent,\nHolocene, sapropel (S1) has suggested that relatively small\nincreases in surface buoyancy can lead to suppression of deep\nwater circulation in the eastern Mediterranean. An increase of 20\u2013\n30% in the freshwater budget is thought to be enough to allow\ninterruption of deep water production [Myers et al., 1998; Rohling\nand De Rijk, 1999; Rohling, 1999b]. Using the Myers [Myers et\nal., 1998] circulation model, the biogeochemical implications of\nPALEOCEANOGRAPHY, VOL. 17, NO. 2, 1024, 10.1029\/2000PA000601, 2002\n1Southampton Oceanography Centre, Southampton, UK.\n2Now at Department of Geophysical Science, University of Bristol,\nBristol, UK.\n3Department of Geology and Oceanography, Bordeaux University,\nUMR 58-05,Talence, France.\n4Natural Environment Research Council Isotope Geoscience Labora-\ntory, Keyworth, UK.\n5National Centre for Marine Research, Athens, Greece.\nCopyright 2002 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0883-8305\/02\/2000PA000601$12.00\n14 - 1\nsapropel formation have been assessed [Stratford et al., 2000].\nPreserving the antiestuarine circulation of the eastern Mediterra-\nnean and using a threefold increase in river inputs [after Kallel et\nal., 1997], organic fluxes in coastal regions and marginal basins\nwere found to approach the required levels for sapropel deposition\n[Stratford et al., 2000].\n[5] The model of Stratford et al. [2000] highlights a common\nproblem recognized in all current models for sapropel formation,\nwith emphasis on the much studied and well-dated S1: \u2018\u2018Where did\nthe nutrients come from to sustain organic matter burial over the\n\u00013 kyr of S1 deposition in the eastern Mediterranean?\u2019\u2019 It appears\nthat steady state models cannot import sufficient nutrients into the\nbasin, outside of the coastal regions and marginal seas, to sustain\nthis accumulation. The steady state models assume that nutrients\nlost via Corg burial are continuously balanced by fluvial\/aeolian\ninfluxes. We here present evidence to suggest that the steady state\napproach is seriously flawed in that a significant period of potential\nnutrient accumulation in a stagnant basin may have preceded the\nactual sapropel deposition.\n[6] We use abundance variations of planktonic foraminifera\ntogether with species-specific oxygen and carbon stable isotope\nratios in these forams to derive a picture of the oceanographic\nprocesses leading up to, during, and after the most recent sapropel\ndeposition in the Aegean. We observe a conspicuous change in\nhydrography, starting \u00016 kyr prior to S1. We validate our observa-\ntions with a simple bioturbation model and use the validated records\nto suggest that long-term (1.5 kyr) storage of nutrients may have\noccurred in the Aegean Basin. When this reservoir became available\nfor production, the formation of S1 commenced.\n2. Methods and Materials\n[7] We present results for two gravity cores from the Northern\nAegean Basin (SL-21 and SL-31) and an additional gravity core\n(SLA-9) together with one piston core (LC-21) from the southern\nAegean (Figure 1). All four cores are comprised of microfossil-rich\nhemipelagic ooze, with a clearly defined darker band of sapropelic\nmaterial.\n[8] Each core was sampled in a continuous sequence: SL-21,\nSL-31, and SLA-9 were sampled at 0.5 cm intervals, and LC-21\nwas sampled at 1 cm intervals. The samples were freeze-dried and\nweighed, and selected (weighed) subsamples were disaggregated\nand wet sieved using demineralized water. The sieved fractions\nwere collected on 600, 150, 125, and 63 mm mesh sizes. The >150\nmm fractions were subdivided using a random splitter to provide an\naliquot of \u0001200 individual planktonic foraminifera. These were\nthen determined and sorted on Chapman slides and counted.\nResults were obtained as numbers g\u00021 and as percentages\n(Figure 2).\n[9] Several AMS radiocarbon dates were obtained for cores LC-\n21, SLA-9, and SL-31 using only hand-picked clean planktonic\nforaminiferal tests with no evidence of pyritization or overgrowth.\nThe samples were too small for monospecific dating, but no\nsystematic differences would be expected for such dates relative\nto our results (see Jorissen et al.\u2019s [1993] comparison of planktonic\nversus benthic dating). The picked material was submitted for\nanalysis at the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)\nradiocarbon laboratory at SURRC (LC-21) and at the Leibniz AMS\nLaboratory at Kiel (Germany) (SLA-9 and SL-31). Radiocarbon\nconvention ages obtained were calibrated using the marine mode of\nthe program Calib 4.2 [Stuiver and Reimer, 1993]. A reservoir age\ncorrection of 149 \u00b1 30 years for the Aegean was used [Facorellis et\nal., 1998]. The results are listed in Table 1. All ages in this paper\nare reported in calibrated kyr B.P. unless otherwise stated.\n[10] Detailed stable oxygen and carbon isotope records have\nbeen constructed for individual planktonic foraminiferal species\nin cores LC-21, SLA-9, SL-21, and SL-31, with resolutions on\nthe order of 1 cm (Figure 3). The species chosen were the very\nshallow, surface-dwelling Globigerinoides ruber; the deeper-\ndwelling Globorotalia inflata associated with deep (winter)\nmixing, and the deep-living species Neogloboquadrina pachy-\nderma, which has been associated with the deep chlorophyll\nmaximum at the base of the euphotic layer. This selection\nfollows global and specific Mediterranean habitat descriptions\nby Hemleben et al. [1989], Pujol and Vergnaud-Grazzini [1995],\nRohling et al. [1993a, 1995, 1997], De Rijk et al. [1999], and\nHayes et al. [1999]. The analyses were performed at two separate\nintercalibrated facilities: the Europa Geo 20\u201320, with individual\nacid bath preparation, at the Southampton Oceanography Centre\n(SOC), and the VG-Optima with a common acid bath preparation\nat NERC Isotope Geoscience Laboratory (NIGL), Keyworth.\nFigure 1.

The shaded area represents the approximate area of\nAEIW upwelling to the surface. This water mass extends from the\nsurface to \u0001200 m depth in the shallow shelf areas off the Turkish\ncoast [Theocharis, 1989; Yu\u00a8ce, 1995; Poulos et al., 1997].\n14 - 2 CASFORD ET AL.: CIRCULATION CHANGES AND NUTRIENT CONCENTRATIONS\nFigure 2.

The main boundaries equate well with the previously\nidentified biozonal boundary II\/III, and biozonal boundary I\/II\n[Jorissen et al., 1993] and this nomennclameture is used. The three\nremaining assemblages consist of subdivisions of biozone I of\nJorissen et al. [1993]. Relevant Mediterranean habitat character-\nistics have been summarized by Rohling et al. [1993a, 1993b,\n1995], Pujol and Vergnaud-Grazzini [1995], De Rijk et al. [1999],\nand Hayes et al. [1999]. From old to young we identify the\nfollowing five assemblages. (1) Assemblage III is an assemblage\ndominated by N. pachyderma and Turborotalita quinqueloba, with\nlower densities of Globorotalia scitula and Globigerinita glutinata,\nand a generally low to very low abundance of G. ruber. This fauna\ndominates the cool \u2018\u2018glacial\u2019\u2019 intervals. (2) Assemblage II is an\nintermediate assemblage characterized by presence of T. quinque-\nloba, somewhat enhanced numbers of N. pachyderma and G.\nglutinata, especially in the central Aegean cores, and the presence\nof G. ruber and G. inflata. (3) Assemblage I is an assemblage\ndominated by the warm subtropical species G. ruber and the\nSPRUDTS group (including but not requiring Globigerinella\nsiphonifera, Hastigerina pelagica (absent in the Aegean), Globo-\nturborotalita rubescens, Orbulina universa, Globigerinella digi-\ntata, Globoturborotalita tenella, and Globigerinoides sacculifer\n[see Rohling et al., 1993a, 1993b]. In addition it includes abundant\nGlobigerina bulloides and somewhat increased T. quinqueloba\ncompared with the preceding assemblage II. (4) Assemblage Ic is\ncharacterized by elevated absolute and relative abundances of the\npink morphotype, G. ruber rosa. A peak in G. inflata is also present\nat the base of this assemblage, followed by a marked absence in this\nspecies in the remainder of Ic. Core LC-21 shows an interruption in\nassemblage Ic with a return to a fauna resembling assemblage II,\nwhich corresponds to an \u2018\u2018interruption\u2019\u2019 of the darker-colored\nsapropel [Hayes et al., 1999; De Rijk et al., 1999; Mercone et\nal., 2000]. (5) Assemblages Ib and Ia are diverse assemblages\ndominated by G. ruber and G. bulloides, with SPRUDTS, G.\ninflata, and G. glutinata. Ib is characterized by elevated numbers of\nG. inflata and appears to be of short duration. Ia shows a fauna\nsimilar to that seen in the present-day Mediterranean (core top data\nof Thunell [1978]). Assemblage Ia shows slightly lower abundan-\nces of \u2018\u2018warm\u2019\u2019 preferring species than assemblage Ic.\n3.2. Stable Isotopes\n[12] Combination plots of the monospecific isotopic profiles of\nd18Oruber, d\n18Oinflata, and d\n18Opachyderma (Figure 3) show several\ndistinct, previously unreported features: Oxygen isotopes initially\nshow a high degree of synchronicity, being similar in value and\nvariation. This is followed by a depletion in d18Oruber that separates\nit from of the unaffected signal of N. pachyderma. This first\nseparation between d18Oruber and d\n18Opachyderma coincides with\nthe biozonal boundary III\/II and corresponds in age with glacial\ntermination T1a. After a short interval of little change, d18Oruber\nshows a second rapid depletion to its typical Holocene values,\nwhile d18Opachyderma remains at pre-Holocene values or even shows\nan enrichment. This enrichment, while generally small, is well\nwithin the sensitivity of our equipment and must be regarded as\nreal. It is most obvious in cores SLA-9 (0.8% over five samples),\nSL-21 (0.5% over 10 samples), and SL-31 (0.4% over four\nsamples), while the available resolution leaves the signal in LC-\n21 inconclusive in this respect. The d18O signal of G. inflata shows\nan inflection to lighter values at the same time as this second\ndepletion in d18Oruber, while the absolute d\n18Oinflata values remain\nTable 1.

This\nsecond sharp depletion in d18Oruber equates with termination T1b.\nFinally, after a period on the order of \u00011 kyr, the values of\nd18Opachyderma also start depleting to this species\u2019 Holocene values.\n[13] Shortly after the start of the depletion in d18Opachyderma to\nHolocene values, we observe a general depletion in d13C. The d13C\nrecords show an initial synchronous drop in both d13Cruber and\nd13Cpachyderma, which is followed in SL-21, SL-31, and SLA-9 by a\nseparation of values as d13Cpachyderma continues to deplete after\nd13Cruber has leveled out. This separation in the d\n13C records\ncoincides with the onset of sapropel deposition.\n3.3. Bioturbation Model\n[14] The offset in the isotopic responses for d18Oruber and\nd18Opachyderma around T1b is conspicuous, and we need to assess\nwhether this is a genuine feature or the result of bioturbation. Owing\nto the rapid fall in numbers of N. pachyderma before the depletion,\nbioturbation might mix a relatively large proportion of undepleted\nforaminifera with the comparatively few depleted forams. This\ncould potentially shift the resultant isotopic composition to less\ndepleted values. To test whether such processes could explain the\nobserved trends, we developed a simple model, which assumes a\nhypothetical step change in the isotopic compositions of both G.\nruber and N. pachyderma at the same point in time. The model then\nsimulates a progressive homogenization (bioturbation) of each\nsuccessive 0.5 cm of deposited sediment with the previous 5 or 10\ncm (separate model runs). Two versions of this simulation were run.\nAn extreme version based on a large step change in numbers of both\nG. ruber and N. pachyderma at the same point as the isotopic shift\nand a run based on the actual numbers observed for these species.\nThe results of the bioturbation model are shown in Figure 4.\n[15] All simulations smoothed the imposed step-like d18O\nchange into more gradual depletions similar to those seen in the\nsedimentary record, with differences in the profiles for the two\nspecies. However, in all cases the inflection point for the d18O\nvalues of both species is the same, with both values start to deplete\nat the same point. This differs markedly from the observed data\nwith a separation in the inflection points of these species by up to\n>15 cm. Only in our most extreme scenario do we approach the\nreal data, with a lag on the order of 5\u201310 cm, although even here\nthe infection points are synchronous on closer observation. The\nmodels also totally failed to reproduce the enrichment trend in N.\npachyderma (5\u201310 data points) that is seen in the actual data\nduring the major depletion in G. ruber (this is most clearly seen in\ncores SL-21, SL-31, and SLA-9).\n[16] The bioturbation model leads us to suggest that the actual\nd18O depletion may have been more step-like than is preserved in\nthe sedimentary record. We also deduce that the offset in inflection\npoints seen in our cores reflects a real change in isotopic gradients\nwithin the water column during this period.\n[17] Interestingly, the signal from G. inflata does appear to\nparallel the N. pachyderma signal shape seen in our model. It too\nsees a marked decline in numbers over the period of isotopic\ndepletion. This signal may therefore provide an indication of the\nstrength of bioturbation below the sapropel, suggesting that homog-\nenization of foraminiferal sized particles due to bioturbation was <5\ncm. This would agree with observations in the faunal counts where\nspecies N. pachyderma, G. inflata, and G. glutinata fall abruptly to\nzero in between consecutive samples at 2.5 cm spacing.\n4. Discussion\n[18] Changes in stable isotope composition have led to consid-\nerable speculation on the variability of Mediterranean freshwater\nbudgets [Huang and Stanley, 1972; Cita et al., 1977; Ryan and\nCita, 1977; Williams et al., 1978; Rossignol-Strick et al., 1982;\nThunell and Williams, 1989; Kallel et al., 1997; Rohling and De\nRijk, 1999]. Recent work points out that oxygen isotopic ratios\nfrom planktonic foraminifera cannot be used to determine absolute\nsalinities in any straightforward way on geological timescales.\nRather, they show responses to hydrographic changes that may\nbe several times greater than the corresponding changes in con-\nservative properties, i.e., salinity [Rohling and De Rijk, 1999;\nRohling, 1999a, 1999b]. Such problems associated with temporal\ngradients are avoided in comparisons of isotopic compositions of\ndifferent species within an individual sample since foraminifera are\nthen analyzed from an area in a single hydrological regime. Thus\ndifferences in the signal between species will reflect real, contem-\nporaneous differences between their preferred habitats.\n[19] We propose that our multiproxy records are best interpreted\nin combination with the foraminiferal abundance records, as a\nseries of successive changing, climatically driven, dynamic\nregimes. These are illustrated as a series of transitory states\ntogether with a schematic summary of the main isotopic and faunal\nchanges recognized in our Aegean records (Figures 5 and 6). Each\nstate represents a single point in time, which may be considered\nFigure 3. Stable isotope data, showing d18O and d13C versus\ndepth, for G. ruber (thick shaded line with triangles), N.\npachyderma (thin solid line with squares) and G. inflata (dashed\nline with circles) in cores SLA-9, SL-21, SL-31, and LC-21. The\nsuperimposed lines represent a 10 cm running Gaussian smoothing\nof the data. The shaded boxes represent the extent of the sapropel\nas defined by the switch from oxygen-requiring benthic forami-\nnifera to the presence of low-oxygen fauna orm in the case of LC-\n21, the total absence of benthic forams.

These transi-\ntory states are described in detail below.\n4.1. State A\n[20] State A is interpreted as typical of the glacial Aegean Sea.\nThis state is characterized by the absence of warm mixed\nlayer species. We observe coinciding values of d18Oruber and\nd18Opachyderma as well as d\n13Cruber and d\n13Cpachyderma, suggesting\nthat there were no isotopic gradients between these shallow- and\nsubsurface-living species. Thus it is deduced that the water column\nduring state A comprised of a single homogenized water mass,\nwith intermediate water undistinguished from surface water. The\npresence of G. inflata is regarded as indicative of deep seasonal\nmixing and is hence shown in association with winter mixing\n[Hemleben et al., 1989; Rohling et al., 1995; Pujol and Vergnaud-\nGrazzini, 1995] (summarized by Rohling et al. [1993a] and Reiss et\nal. [2000]). The faunal assemblage comprised of predominantly\ncool-water species, with only very rare occurrences of the warm\ndweller G. ruber. T. quinqueloba is shown as the principal surface\ndweller [cf. Rohling et al., 1993a]. G. scitula and N. pachyderma\nare shown living at depth. N. pachyderma is known to thrive at or\njust above the base of the euphotic zone and generally prefers\nstable stratified environments [Hemleben et al., 1989; Rohling and\nGieskes, 1989; Rohling et al., 1993a, 1995; Reiss et al., 2000]. G.\nscitula in particular is tolerant of low temperatures [Hemleben et\nal., 1989], and we therefore shown it as present exclusively in\nwinter, although we cannot exclude its possible presence from\nother seasons on the basis of the data available.\n4.2. State B\n[21] This state is typical of the regime we believe marks\nthe appearance of distinct seasonal stratification in the post-\nglacial Aegean. The earliest depletion in d18Oruber represents\ntermination 1a. The onset of a separation between the d18Oruber\nand d18Opachyderma records suggests that G. ruber lived in an\nisotopically different water mass than N. pachyderma. Where\navailable, the d18Oinflata values clearly follow the d\n18Opachyderma\nrecord. Therefore we show these two species in state B as\ninhabiting the same water mass: G. inflata in the deep winter\nmixed season and N. pachyderma below the seasonal thermocline\nin the previous winter\u2019s water. The increased abundance of G. ruber\nover termination 1a itself also indicates the development of sea-\nsonal stratification with a warm mixed layer since G. ruber has a\nminimum temperature requirement of \u000114\u0003C [Hemleben et al.,\n1989; Bijma et al., 1990a, 1990b; Reiss et al., 2000]. Hence we\ninfer that termination 1a was associated with significant develop-\nment\/strengthening of the summer thermocline. This is further\ncorroborated by the increase in N. pachyderma abundances since\nthis species is known to prevail in stable stratified settings with a\nwell-developed deep chlorophyll maximum [Hemleben et al., 1989;\nRohling and Gieskes, 1989; Rohling et al., 1993a, 1993b; Reiss et\nal., 2000]. Plankton tows from the modern NW Mediterranean\nclearly illustrate N. pachyderma\u2019s preference for such hydrographic\nconditions [Rohling et al., 1995]. The continued presence of the G.\ninflata and its peak in abundance toward the end of biozone II\nstrongly suggests the persistence of seasonal mixing to considerable\ndepth. The shallower-living (\u000175 m) species G. glutinata [Reiss et\nal., 2000] also occurs in state B. This species is a specialist diatom\nfeeder [Hemleben et al., 1989] and is normally associated with the\nspring bloom, triggered by the newly available nutrients at the end\nof winter mixing and increased solar irradiation. Thus we interpret\nthe overall evidence for state B as indicative of seasonal, thermal\nstratification, alternating with vigorous seasonal overturn of the\nwater column in the colder months.\n4.3. State C\n[22] State C in particular represents a transitory phase, marking a\n\u2018\u2018snapshot\u2019\u2019 within the changing conditions from the start of\ntermination 1b to the onset of sapropel production. This regime\nsees the first occurrence of O. universa and other members of the\nFigure 4. Bioturbation model, which illustrates the smoothing of a hypothetical stepped change in isotopic values\n(left panel) with a progressive homogenization to simulate bioturbation effects. This includes two runs of the model:\none based on the actual numbers per gram of G. ruber (thick shaded line) and N. pachyderma (thin solid line) found\nin core SL-21 and another based on a hypothetical extreme step change in numbers per gram, with this change taking\nplace at the same point as the step change in isotopic value. Each version was run with a 5 and a 10 cm\nhomogenization, and these are plotted adjacent to each other for comparison. The horizontal tie lines (dotted lines)\nhighlight the timing of the inflections in the derived d18O records.\n14 - 6 CASFORD ET AL.: CIRCULATION CHANGES AND NUTRIENT CONCENTRATIONS\nSPRUDTS group. These taxa prefer warm conditions and are\nshown in Figure 5 above the thermocline. O. universa lives in a\ntemperature range of 12\u0003\u201331\u0003C, and although its photosynthetic\nsymbionts show a dominant habitat in shallower waters, with\nsufficient light penetration, it can be found down to 250 m,\n[Hemleben et al., 1989]. We interpret the increase in SPRUDTS\nand of G. ruber as indicative of an increase in depth and extent of\nthe thermocline. The regime in state C is also characterized by the\ndistinct decoupling of the d18Oruber and d\n18Opachyderma signals at the\nbiozone I\/II boundary, marking an increasing (isotopic) isolation of\nintermediate\/bottom waters from the surface system. There is a\nsynchronous onset of depletions in d18Oruber and d\n18Oinflata, but\nd18Opachyderma, on the contrary, responds initially with a small\nenrichment. As d18Oinflata inflects with d\n18Oruber, we deduce that\nthe winter water (d18Oinflata) responded to the same climatic trend\nas the summer water (d18Oruber). This is what would be expected\nfor a substantial perturbation: the effect is seen first and strongest\nin the shallow summer mixed layer and subsequently passed on to\nthe more voluminous winter mixed layer. Any species living below\nthe summer mixed layer effectively lives in the previous year\u2019s\nwinter water, and hence even subsurface summer species should\nreflect the main isotopic change. However, as d18Opachyderma shows\na completely independent and opposite response, we infer that N.\npachyderma lived in a water mass \u2018\u2018isolated\u2019\u2019 from the surface\nwater system. For this reason, we indicate N. pachyderma in an\nintermediate water mass (IW) that was strongly differentiated from\nthe surface system, with the mixing indicators restricted to levels\nabove the IW boundary. Such a condition could have resulted from\nan invasion of intermediate water from a remote source. Despite\nthe presence of a physically stable environment for N. pachyderma\nwe see a rapid reduction in this species\u2019 abundance, suggesting that\nits habitat underwent rapid deterioration. This would fit with our\nproposal of remotely derived intermediate water since an increase\nin the pathway from its source relative to the previous locally\nproduced AEIW would result in poorer oxygenation for intermedi-\nate water masses in the Aegean. State C also shows a marked\nreduction in numbers of G. inflata, implying that seasonal water\ncolumn homogenization became inhibited. Shortly following state\nC, G. inflata numbers dwindle into insignificance. The only\nspecies showing a real increase is G. glutinata. G. glutinata may\nrequire less dramatic vertical mixing and may hence have replaced\nG. inflata. However, as G. glutinata has a short reproductive cycle\n[Hemleben et al., 1989] it\u2019s occurrence may also be an opportun-\nistic response to any increase in nutrient availability. We also\nidentify an increase in numbers of the eutrophic species G.\nbulloides. On the basis of its year-round occurrence in the area\ntoday [Pujol and Vergnaud-Grazzini, 1995] we have represented it\nwith a year-round occurrence. State C therefore represents a\nprogressive warming of climate and a resulting reduction in local\nintermediate and deep water production. This allows the increasing\nisolation of the intermediate water, which in turn allows the\nFigure 5. Summary of major changes in isotopic signals d18O\nand d13C.

Schematic reconstruction of the history of Aegean\ncirculation. The states illustrated are transitory, and this schematic\nrepresents the typical changes in deep water mixing and faunal\ndistribution in the Aegean since the last glaciation. The timing of\nthese transitions and placement of these typical assemblages are\nsummarized in Figure 5.\nCASFORD ET AL.: CIRCULATION CHANGES AND NUTRIENT CONCENTRATIONS 14 - 7\nmineralization products resultant from surface productivity to\naccumulate in more or less isolated deeper waters.\n4.4. State D\n[23] This represents the deposition of sapropel S1 and is the\nculmination of the sequence of changes that started with termi-\nnation 1b. Roughly 1 kyr after the start of the T1b depletion in\nd18Oruber, a similar depletion begins to show up in d\n18Opachyderma.\nThe long time lag suggests that diffusive mixing was the major\nmechanism for transfer of the isotopic depletion from the surface\n(G. ruber) to the deeper environments (N. pachyderma) since\nconvective mixing would have caused a virtually instantaneous\nresponse between the two species (see, for example, the coinci-\ndence between the onsets of depletion in d18Oruber and d\n18Oinflata).\nThe anomalous response of d18Opachyderma led us to conclude that it\nwas living subsurface in a water mass unaffected by the local\nseasonal homogenization (see state C). The d13Cpachyderma in state\nD becomes strongly depleted relative to d13Cinflata and d\n13Cruber,\nsuggesting that the strongly reduced N. pachyderma population\nthat could survive did so subsurface in an \u2018\u2018isolated\u2019\u2019 poorly\nventilated water mass with accumulation of 12C-rich remineraliza-\ntion products. We therefore contend that the eventual depletion in\nd18Opachyderma resulted from a slow diffusive mixing process. Our\ninference of a halt in convective mixing is supported by the\npresence of dysoxic indicators in the benthic foraminiferal fauna\nwithin S1 since a lack of convective overturn results in poor\nventilation and consequently dysoxia in bottom waters. For some\nintervals, at depth (LC-21, 1500 m), no benthic species survive at\nall, suggesting that bottom waters became totally anoxic. In the\nplanktonic foraminifera, assemblage Ic dominates, which consists\nof predominately warm-water species with a notable absence of\nfall\/winter\/spring mixing indicators. Hence we infer that there was\na strongly developed, possibly year-round, thermocline\/halocline.\nDuring this regime we see depletion in d13C for all species\nrecorded. This may be the effect of influx of terrestrial dissolved\norganic carbon (DOC) [Asku et al., 1999] since this period is\nknown to coincide with a widespread increase in humidity. This is\nalso evidenced by high North African lake levels, high abundance\nof humidity markers in the local palynological records, and the\nisotopic anomalies in speleothem data [Rossignol-Strick, 1995;\nEdmunds et al., 1999; Bar-Matthews et al., 1999; Tzedakis,\n1999; deMenocal et al., 2000]. The resultant increase in freshwater\ninput is schematically represented by a rainfall symbol in state D,\neven though much of the fresh water would have arrived in the\nform of river runoff rather than direct precipitation [Jenkins and\nWiliams, 1983; Shaw and Evans, 1984; Thunell and Williams,\n1989; Rohling and Hilgen, 1991; Rohling, 1994, 1999b]. As\nmentioned previously, d13Cpachyderma depletes more than d\n13Cruber\nand d13Cinflata, which suggests that such any DOC explanation\nneeds to be combined with the concept that N. pachyderma\nsurvived in an ageing water mass. With the intermediate water\nisolated and (virtually) stagnating, it would accumulate an excess\nof 12C from remineralization. In contrast, the shallow d13Cruber\nsignal is continually being equilibrated by contact with the atmos-\nphere. Note that the separation in d13C signals coincides with the\nonset of sapropel formation and therefore with the appearance of\nbenthic markers for very poor bottom water oxygenation, suggest-\ning a culmination of subsurface\/deep water stagnation.\n4.5. State E\n[24] Here we recognize the establishment of a modern circu-\nlation regime. The d18Opachyderma and d\n18Oinflata signals have come\nback together, suggesting that both live in isotopically undiffer-\nentiated winter water. The d18Oruber is also similar to d\n18Opachyderma\nand d18Oinflata in SL-21 but is slightly more depleted in the\nremaining cores.

This may indicate\nthat (1) intermediate waters are upwelling to the surface and\/or (2)\nsurface waters directly contribute to intermediate water formation.\nSlight d13C differentiation between N. pachyderma and G. ruber\/\nG. inflata suggests that N. pachyderma continued to live subsur-\nface at levels more affected by remineralization than the surface\/\nmixed layer environments preferred by G. ruber and G. inflata.\nThe return of deep mixing indicator G. inflata and the presence of\nthe spring bloom indicator G. glutinata suggests that seasonal\nmixing is again well developed. In addition, we see a dominance of\nG. bulloides, giving an overall faunal aspect that is very similar to\nthat seen in modern records [Thunell, 1978; Pujol and Vergnaud-\nGrazzini, 1995].\n4.6. Deductions on Mechanism and Timing of\nCirculation Change\n[25] Having identified a general trend of reduced potential for\ndeep overturn in the circulatory system during the 6 kyr leading up\nto sapropel production, we now consider the mechanism and\ntiming of these changes. The trend starts from a glacial environ-\nment characterized by a single well-mixed water mass with strong\naccordance between isotopic signals in all species analyzed. This\nsuggests little density contrast in the water column, while the\npresence of deep mixing species like G. inflata points to regular\nhomogenization\/overturn. We have interpreted this as indicative of\nyear-round mixing. This glacial circulation appears to alter with the\nstart of termination 1a. At that time, a shift in environment is\nclearly indicated in both the fauna and the isotopic data. Our\ninterpolated dates suggest the onset of this change at \u000115.9 ka\n(Table 2). This change associated with T1a appears to have\noccurred very rapidly, within a few hundred years.\n[26] The subsequent regime is characterized by the start\/\nstrengthening of summer stratification. We believe this change in\ncirculation was driven by the combination of climatic warming and\nrising sea levels at the onset of the Bo\u00a8lling-Aller\u00f8d. During that\ninterval we see the first substantial occurrence of warm mixed layer\nspecies, suggesting a general sea surface warming. Together with\nthe increase in N. pachyderma, this leads us to suggest the\ndevelopment\/strengthening of a stable summer thermocline in a\ngenerally well oxygenated environment. Studies of African lake\nlevels and aeolian dust influxes [Edmunds et al., 1999; deMenocal\net al., 2000] suggest that this period also saw the start of a regional\nhumidity increase (African humid phase (AHP)). Any increase in\nfreshwater budget would have increased surface buoyancy, helping\nto establish (seasonal) stratification. This state persisted until the\nonset of the Younger Dryas (YD) at \u000112.5 ka.\n[27] In common with many Mediterranean records, the YD is\nrepresented in this study by a plateau in the d18O records. The\nfauna shows increases in the mixing indicator G. inflata and a\ndecrease in relative abundance of the warm mixed layer species.\nThis suggests a strengthening of winter convection during this\nperiod. The YD has also been identified as an interruption in the\nAHP [deMenocal et al., 2000], and probably represented a cool\narid climatic event [Rossignol-Strick, 1993, 1995, 1999]. The YD\nconditions continue until the start of termination 1b marked at\n\u000111.3 ka in our records.\n[28] The start of T1b marks a clear dissociation between\nd18Opachyderma and d\n18Oruber\/d\n18Oinflata, from which we deduce that\nthe (intermediate) water mass in which N. pachyderma lived was\nno longer locally connected to the surface system. In addition, we\nargue that the major source region of intermediate water at this\ntime was somewhere outside of the Aegean. Adriatic intermediate\nwater would be one possible source of our proposed \u2018\u2018foreign\u2019\u2019\nintermediate water in the Aegean. This agrees with suggestions of\nMyers et al. [1998] that, the Adriatic Sea was a major source of\nintermediate water to the eastern Mediterranean during sapropel\nformation and that this under certain circumstances could enter the\nAegean Sea [Myers and Rohling, 2000]. This introduction of\nforeign intermediate water also has implications for the dating of\nforaminiferal material, a proportion of which will be living in this\nolder water. Correlation between the LC-21 timescale and the GISP\nII data suggests we see the start of a 350 year offset in LC-21 dates\nwithin the anoxic phase. This offset appears to be largely finished\nby the time of the deposition of the Santorini ash layer [Rohling et\nal., 2002]. T1b marked the end of the peak in G. inflata abundance\nand a shift toward the dominance of the shallower-living species\nG. glutinata and of warm mixed layer species. This signals the\ninhibition of deep mixing and the isolation of intermediate waters,\ncorroborating our interpretation of the separation between d18Oruber\nand d18Opachyderma. From this point on, remineralization products\nwere able to build up in the subsurface to deep waters.\n[29] With the ending of the Younger Dryas, the AHP recom-\nmenced and persisted until 5.5 ka [deMenocal et al., 2000]. In the\nAegean cores we note a depletion in d13C for all species\nanalyzed, starting at \u000110.5 ka, which we interpret as a possibly\nthe result of increasing humidity in the Aegean Sea. Coinciding\nwith this depletion in d13C, G. glutinata replaces G. inflata. This\nmay be tentatively explained in terms of increased freshwater\ninput, which reduced surface buoyancy loss and hence suppressed\nmixing.\n[30] With the suppression of convective mixing in the Aegean,\ndiffusion-type processes become the main driver for property\nexchange through the water column. At \u000110.2 ka, we identify an\ninflection in d18Opachyderma, which seems to mark the start of the\nconveyance of the termination 1b signal to the isolated intermedi-\nate water. This allows us to determine a timescale of diffusive\nmixing. By assessing the time between the maximum d18Oruber-\nd18Opachyderma gradient and its 1\/e-fold reduction we can roughly\nestimate the diffusive timescale for the basin in its stratified\nsapropel mode. We calculate this to be \u0001450 years (Table 2).\n[31] By \u00019.8 ka, deposition of sapropel S1 has commenced\n(Table 2). This is \u0001400 years after the total suppression of mixing\ninferred from the start of the overall d13C depletion and the faunal\nshift to a virtually complete dominance of mixed layer species. The\nstart of sapropel production also occurs \u00011500 years after the\nisolation of the deep\/intermediate waters, inferred from the sepa-\nration of d18Oruber and d\n18Opachyderma. The isolation of subsurface\nwaters would have allowed subsurface accumulation of reminer-\nalization products over a period of up to 1.5 kyr before these\nproducts became available for production in the euphotic zone. We\nsuggest that this long-term accumulation provided a major source\nof excess nutrients that could sustain enhanced productivity during\nsapropel deposition.\n[32] On the basis of benthic foraminiferal indicators, S1 per-\nsisted until 6.5 ka (Table 2). At its termination the return of G.\ninflata indicates the restart of seasonal mixing. The warm\/cold\nplots (Figure 2) suggest this may have been a cooling event. In LC-\n21 the end of the benthic sapropel is marked in the planktonic\nrecord by the occurrence of G. glutinata first rather than G. inflata.\nThis may be related to the proximity of the northern Aegean cores\n(SL-21 and SL-31) to the area of deep water production in the\nAthos Basin [Yu\u00a8ce, 1995], While the more remote position of LC-\n21 from the region of water column overturn, would have resulted\nin a more gradual increase in seasonal mixing, with a correspond-\ningly different progression in the fauna. The general d13C depletion\nmay reflect terrestrial DOC influx due to increased humidity\npersisted until \u00014.9 ka. However, the timing of the d13C depletion,\nsome 400 years after suppression of mixing, is of the same order as\nour e-fold diffusive timescale, suggesting that the carbon depletion\nmaybe in part due to the upward advective-diffusive transport of\n13C-depleted dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). This DIC would be\nsupplied from deeper waters, depleted in 13C by remineralization.\nCASFORD ET AL.: CIRCULATION CHANGES AND NUTRIENT CONCENTRATIONS 14 - 9\nAround that time the fauna also settled into its modern abundance\ndistributions (Ib-Ia transition, Table 2).\n5. Conclusions\n[33] There is a clear link between the Aegean hydrographic\nregime and the global deglaciation phases. Seasonal stratification\nis weak to nonexistent before the onset of termination 1a, while\nintermediate water was virtually indistinguishable from shallow\nwaters. After the onset of termination 1a, we identify a distinct\nseasonal stratification alternating with vigorous overturning sea-\nsons. This resulted in a winter mixed layer of similar characteristics\nto the intermediate water and a summer mixed layer that was\ndistinguished from this by a marked seasonal thermocline. T1b\nmarks the next distinct hydrographic change when intermediate\nwater became dissociated from the summer\/winter mixed layers in\nthe study area. This noncommunication between the surface and\nintermediate system indicates reduced\/curtailed ventilation of inter-\nmediate and deeper waters. This implies that property exchanges\nwould have become dominated by slow (diffusive) mixing, and we\nestimate a 1\/e-fold diffusive mixing timescale of \u0001450 years. This\ngives the first ever observation-based quantitative estimate of this\ntimescale in the stratified (sapropel mode) Mediterranean.\n[34] Furthermore, the dissociation of surface and intermediate\nsystems allowed remineralization products to accumulate in\nintermediate and deep waters, over a period of up to \u00011.5 kyr\nprior to sapropel deposition. Meanwhile, the isolated intermediate\nwater would have become progressively more dysoxic, a process\naugmented by the observed increase in (year-round?) stratifica-\ntion. The sapropel therefore appears to represent the culmination\nof a dynamic nonsteady state process. This has important con-\nsequences for the currently accepted steady state approach to\ncirculation and property budget calculations for the eastern\nMediterranean in sapropel mode. The sapropel mode ended with\nthe reoccurrence of winter mixing indicative species at \u00016.5 ka,\nwhile the return to a modern faunal assemblage was completed\nby \u00014.9 ka.\n[35] Acknowledgments.
