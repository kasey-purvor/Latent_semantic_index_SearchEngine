Introduction\nWith the globalisation of all the commercial and industrial activities, one of the key issues\nat the forefront of any chief executive's mind has been the question \"How to create and\nsustain competitive advantage at a global scale through collaboration\".\nIn this context collaboration means partnering with suppliers, customers, designers,\nresearch institutes, and so on to integrate their individual competencies to create a level\nof competency that is unmatched and difficult to copy and develop.\nOver the last decade, concepts such as supply chain management, extended\nenterprises and virtual enterprises have emerged, each describing a different level or\nformat of strategic collaboration. Out of these concepts, supply chain management has\ngained significant acceptance in industry whereas others, such as extended enterprises\nand virtual enterprises, have remained as academic concepts with no real industrial and\ncommercial application.\nIt is now an accepted fact that in the 21st century, competition will be between value-\nchains, which efficiently and effectively integrate their competencies and resources to\ncompete in a global economy. The European Unions research and development\nobjectives under the 6th Framework Programme make it clear that, as yet, we do not\nunderstand how to manage a collaborative\/extended enterprise.\nThis paper will develop the argument that our limited understanding of how to measure\nand manage performance in extended and virtual enterprises is one of the main barriers\nto wide scale acceptance and practical use of these concepts by industry and\ncommerce. It will also demonstrate, through empirical evidence, that the systems\nrequired to measure and manage the performance of extended enterprises, whilst being\nbased upon existing performance measurement frameworks and models, would be\nstructurally and operationally different.\nBititci U S, Mendibil K, Albores P, Martinez M, 2005, \"Measuring and Managing Performance in Collaborative Enterprises\", International\nJournal of Operations and Production Management vol 25, no. 4 , pp 333-353, (ISSN 0144-3577).\n4\nIn tackling these issues, the paper integrates a number of existing concepts and it\ndemonstrates that like all businesses, extended enterprises also have a common,\ncybernetic, structure upon which a performance measurement and management model\ncould be developed.\nIn the following sections the paper will first present the methodological basis of the\nresearch presented in this paper. It will then describe the background to the research\nprogramme emphasising the relevant literature and go on to developing and validating\nthe common cybernetic structure for extended enterprises. It will then develop and\ndemonstrate the performance measurement model necessary to measure and manage\nthe performance of an extended enterprise. The paper concludes with an in-depth\ndiscussion on the relative merits and limitations of the work done, emphasising the new\nknowledge emerging from the research.\n2. Methodology\nFrom a methodological perspective this research is based on innovative constructivism\n(Kaplan 1998, Kasanen et al 1993). Here, the researcher starts with an observation of\nthe limitations of the current knowledge and practices and goes on to develop innovative\nideas to address these limitations either through documentation of innovative practices\n(Kaplan 1998) or through logical deduction from the existing literature. The researcher\nthen collects cases, teaches and speaks about the innovation, writes articles and books,\nand then implements the new concept. The researcher goes through this loop (Figure 1)\nseveral times to achieve initial, intermediate and advanced implementations, which\ncontinuously informs theory (Meredith, 1993). This approach was used to develop the\nBalanced Score Card (Kaplan and Norton, 1992 - 1996 - 2000a -2000b).\nBititci U S, Mendibil K, Albores P, Martinez M, 2005, \"Measuring and Managing Performance in Collaborative Enterprises\", International\nJournal of Operations and Production Management vol 25, no. 4 , pp 333-353, (ISSN 0144-3577).\n5\nFigure 1. Meredith's research process.\nThe research presented in this paper can be seen as:\n\uf0b7 An initial observation of the limitations of the current knowledge in performance\nmeasurement in the context of extended enterprises.\n\uf0b7 An initial deduction, from literature, and explanation of a model for performance\nmeasurement and management in extended enterprises.\n\uf0b7 Initial testing and description of the validity of this model.\nThe validity of the model built was tested through a single, but in depth, case study. The\ncase data was collected through a series of semi-structured interviews and workshops\nwith the management team of the case study organisation.\n3. Background\nThe research presented in this paper has been conducted as part of a EU 5th Framework\nIST programme on Advanced Methodologies and Tools for Knowledge Management\nwithin Extended Manufacturing Enterprises (K-Flow: G1RD-2001-00665). The authors of\nthis paper were specifically responsible for investigating the performance measurement\nand management issues in extended enterprises, which is the focus of this paper.\nT H E O R Y\n(Source: Meredith, 1993)\nBititci U S, Mendibil K, Albores P, Martinez M, 2005, \"Measuring and Managing Performance in Collaborative Enterprises\", International\nJournal of Operations and Production Management vol 25, no. 4 , pp 333-353, (ISSN 0144-3577).\n6\nThis section first looks at the literature on performance measurement and then goes on\nto look at literature on extended enterprises with specific emphasis on performance\nmeasurement in extended enterprises.\n3.1 Performance Measurement\nThe background to this research extends back to the mid 1980s when the need for\nbetter-integrated performance measurement systems was identified (Johnson and\nKaplan, 1987, McNair and Masconi, 1987, Kaplan, 1990, Druker, 1990 and Russell,\n1992). Since then, there have been numerous publications emphasising the need for\nmore relevant, integrated, balanced, strategic and improvement-oriented performance\nmeasurement systems.\nIn terms of frameworks and models, the SMART model (Cross and Lynch 1988-1989)\nand the Performance Measurement Questionnaire (Dixon et al 1990) were developed in\nthe late 80s. In the 90s the Balanced Scorecard (Kaplan and Norton, 1996) made a\nsignificant impact by creating a simple, but effective, framework for performance\nmeasurement. During the 90s, the European Business Excellence Model (EFQM, 1998)\nalso made a significant impact on what measures companies used and what they did\nwith these measures. The EPSRC funded research on Integrated Performance\nMeasurement Systems tested the feasibility of developing an auditable reference model\nfrom three different view points - Structures (Bititci and Carrie 1998), Information (Kehoe\nand Little 1998) and People Behaviour (Burns and Backhouse, 1998). This work built\nupon the Balanced Scorecard and EFQM Models, using the Viable Systems Structure\n(Beer, 1985) and resulted in the development of the Integrated Performance\nMeasurement Systems Reference Model.\nOther research programmes, and to a certain extent consultancy organisations, also\ndeveloped approaches, procedures and guidelines for developing and designing\neffective performance measurement systems (Doumeingts et al, 1995, Krause 1999).\nThe Performance Measurement Workbook (Neely et al 1996) and more recently the\nPerformance Prism (Neely and Adams, 2001) encapsulates the contents of the previous\nmodels. Both of these are now widely published and used.\nThere have been several other initiatives for developing and defining performance\nmeasures for various business areas and processes, including performance measures\nBititci U S, Mendibil K, Albores P, Martinez M, 2005, \"Measuring and Managing Performance in Collaborative Enterprises\", International\nJournal of Operations and Production Management vol 25, no. 4 , pp 333-353, (ISSN 0144-3577).\n7\nfor production planning and control (Kochhar et al 1996, Oliver Wight inc 1993),\nperformance measures for the product development process (Oliver 1996, O'Donnel and\nDuffy 2002), performance measurement for Human Resources (Kelly & Gennard 2001,\nGibb 2002) performance measurement for service management (Wilson 2000,\nFitzgerald et al 1991), and so on.\nAll this work has led to significant developments in the field of performance\nmeasurement and management but from a single enterprise point of view. An important\nfinding of this research is that none of the above works consider performance\nmeasurement from an extended enterprise perspective. However, they do provide a\nplatform to inform further research into performance measurement in extended\nenterprises. Common themes emerging from the literature on performance\nmeasurement relevant to this research are:\nPerformance measurement systems should:\n\uf0b7 be balanced - i.e. the requirements of various stakeholders (shareholders,\ncustomers, employees, society, environment) need to be included (Kaplan and\nNorton 1996, Dixon et al 1990, Russel 1992, EFQM 1998, Bititci 1998, Neely 2001)\n\uf0b7 be integrated - i.e. relationships between various measures need to be understood\n(Dixon et al 1990, Russel 1992, Suwignjo et al 2000, Neely et al 1996).\n\uf0b7 inform strategy - i.e. not be driven by strategy but provide an input to strategy (Bititci\n1998 and 2000, Neely and Adams 2001)\n\uf0b7 deploy strategy - i.e. propagate and translate strategic objectives throughout the\norganisation to the critical parts of the organisation (Kaplan and Norton 2000a and\n2000b, Bititci et al 1997 and 2000, Neely et al 1996).\n\uf0b7 focus on business processes that deliver value (EFQM 1998, Bititci et al 1997, Neely\nand Adams 2001)\n\uf0b7 be specific to business units (Kaplan and Norton 2000a and 2000b, Neely et al 1996,\nBititci et al 1997)\nBititci U S, Mendibil K, Albores P, Martinez M, 2005, \"Measuring and Managing Performance in Collaborative Enterprises\", International\nJournal of Operations and Production Management vol 25, no. 4 , pp 333-353, (ISSN 0144-3577).\n8\n\uf0b7 include competencies - i.e. capabilities and competencies that determine how value\nis created and sustained (Kaplan and Norton 2000a and 2000b, Neely and Adams\n2001)\n\uf0b7 include stakeholder contribution - i.e. the role of the stakeholders and the\ncontribution they can make to the success and failure of a business (Neely and\nAdams 2001)\n3.2 Extended Enterprises\nAccording to Browne et al (1995) the EE concept is close to what Christopher (1992)\ncalls \u201cCo-makership\u201d, \u201ca long-term relationship with a limited number of suppliers on the\nbase of mutual confidence\u201d. This co-makership allows the partners to work together on\nengineering the value of their product, besides developing simplified means of ordering\nand invoicing which improve quality and reduce costs for all parties (Childe, 1998).\nChilde (1998) defines an extended enterprise as \"a conceptual business unit or system\nthat consists of a purchasing company and suppliers who collaborate closely in such a\nway as to maximise the returns to each partner \".\nFrom the literature on extended enterprises the following pertinent points have been\nextracted as being of relevance to the research presented in this paper:\n\uf0b7 External forces, such as economical situations, social values, political constraints\nand available technology, affect strategic aspects of the extended enterprise (O\u2019Neill\nand Sackett 1994 and Martinez et al. 2001).\n\uf0b7 The extended enterprise is a philosophy where member organisations (EE Actors)\nstrategically combine their core competencies and capabilities to create a unique\ncompetency. A facet of this approach is the development of products and services\nthat best fit the physical and intellectual characteristic of the individual markets\n(Martinez et al. 2001, Kochhar and Zhang 2002).\n\uf0b7 In extended enterprises people across a number of organisations participate in the\ndecision-making process. This demands knowledge integration. It also means a\nBititci U S, Mendibil K, Albores P, Martinez M, 2005, \"Measuring and Managing Performance in Collaborative Enterprises\", International\nJournal of Operations and Production Management vol 25, no. 4 , pp 333-353, (ISSN 0144-3577).\n9\ndeep change in the power structures in the organisations concerned. Therefore, the\nimprovement in education levels and the development of stronger civic attitudes,\nincreased participation and improved communications are prerequisites for effective\noperation of extended enterprises (O\u2019Neill and Sackett 1994).\n\uf0b7 In an extended enterprise each company is self-organised, while the extended\nenterprise imposes a federal structure for communication and synchronisation\nbetween individual enterprises (Martinez et al. 2001).\n\uf0b7 The Extended Enterprise is a knowledge-based organisation that uses the distributed\nintellectual strengths of its members, suppliers and customers. Knowledge and trust\nare key resources in an extended enterprise (O\u2019Neill and Sackett 1994).\n\uf0b7 The Extended Enterprise business strategy formulation is an incremental process;\nplanning, implementation, evaluation and revision represent small steps, done\nalmost simultaneously (Martinez et al. 2001, Lillehagen and Karlsen 2001).\n\uf0b7 Senior management\u2019s main strategic role is setting purpose, promoting change and\ndefining generic procedures. Moreover, management is deeply involved in tactical\nand operational decisions. The managerial hierarchy is flat and decision-making is\nwidely distributed (O\u2019Neill and Sackett 1994, Ip-Shing et al 2000).\n\uf0b7 For an Extended Enterprise, the operations strategy is a natural outcome of the\nbusiness strategy. Operations is seen as a specialised form of service, where the\nintegration of competencies of all those involved in the operations process achieves\neconomies of scope (Eneroth and Malm 2001, Lillehagen and Karlsen 2001).\n\uf0b7 The operations of extended enterprises needs to be carefully coordinated and\nsynchronised as it is a process within a single enterprise. This will involve multi-\nskilled and multi-cultural people working in different enterprises. The use of\nappropriate planning and coordination systems and tools, supporting communication\nfacilities, that will enable the team members to share information and to synchronise\nthe activities, are also critical prerequisites (O\u2019Neill and Sackett 1994).\n\uf0b7 It is also essential that learning (i.e. new knowledge) is shared across the extended\nenterprise (Coscia 2002, Preiss 1999).\nBititci U S, Mendibil K, Albores P, Martinez M, 2005, \"Measuring and Managing Performance in Collaborative Enterprises\", International\nJournal of Operations and Production Management vol 25, no. 4 , pp 333-353, (ISSN 0144-3577).\n10\nThe literature review led the researchers to develop a particular understanding of an\nextended enterprise and its difference from a supply chain. In the context of this\nresearch a supply chain is a customer-supplier chain of individual enterprises, each\noperating as an individual enterprise trying to maximise its own corporate goals, thus\nsub-optimising the overall performance. Whereas an extended enterprise is a chain of\nenterprises, which essentially behave as a single enterprise trying to maximise the\ncorporate goals of the extended enterprise, thus optimising the performance of each\nindividual enterprise. This difference is illustrated in Figure 2.\nFigure 2. Extended enterprise v. supply chain\nBased on the literature and the above difference between the supply chain and extended\nenterprise this research adopted the following definition for extended enterprise:\nExtended Enterprise is a knowledge-based organisation which uses the\ndistributed capabilities, competencies and intellectual strengths of its members to\ngain competitive advantage to maximise the performance of the overall extended\nenterprise.\nEE\nS\nu\np\np\nly\nC\nh\nai\nn\nV\nie\nw\nE1\nsupplier\nMax.\nPerform.\nE2\ncust\/supp\nMax.\nPerform.\nE3\ncustomer\nMax.\nPerform\nE1\nsupplier\nE2\ncust\/supp\nMax.\nPerform\nE3\ncustomerE\nxt\nen\nd\ned\nE\nn\nte\nrp\nri\nse\nV\nie\nw\nMax. individual\nperformance\nSub-optimised overall\nperformance\nOptimised individual\nperformance\nMax. overall performance\nwhere gains are shared\nbetween enterprises\nOpt.\nPerform\nOpt.\nPerform\nOpt.\nPerform\nS\nu\np\np\nly\nC\nh\nai\nn\nV\nie\nw\nE\nxt\nen\nd\ned\nE\nn\nte\nrp\nri\nse\nV\nie\nw\nBititci U S, Mendibil K, Albores P, Martinez M, 2005, \"Measuring and Managing Performance in Collaborative Enterprises\", International\nJournal of Operations and Production Management vol 25, no. 4 , pp 333-353, (ISSN 0144-3577).\n11\n3.3 Performance Measurement in Extended Enterprises\nIn order to identify the most appropriate performance measurement system for extended\nenterprises, a review of performance measurement systems in Supply Chains, Extended\nEnterprises and Virtual Enterprises were conducted.\nGunasekaran et al (2001) propose a series of performance metrics for performance\nevaluation of supply chains. The measures and metrics are arranged in three levels\n(strategic, tactical and operational) and along the five elements of an integrated supply\nchain: Plan performance, source performance, production performance, deliver\nperformance and customer satisfaction. This is rather similar to the hierarchical\nperformance measurement structure used within version 5 of SCOR model (Supply\nChain Operations Reference model - www.supply-chain.org) which views a supply chain\nas six key processes (Plan, Source, Make, Deliver, Return and Enablers) and presents a\nset of performance measures which can be broken down from the entire supply chain\n(Level) down in to individual processes (Level 2) and into specific activities within each\nprocess (Level 3).\nBeamon (1999) proposes an alternative framework, comprising of three types of\nperformance measures: resource measure, output measures and flexibility measures.\nShe argues that supply chain performance measurement system must contain at least\none individual measure from each of the identified types.\nKochhar and Zhang (2002) in studying the performance measurement systems of virtual\nenterprises identified that each individual enterprise has its own performance\nmeasurement system part of which relates to its activities related to the virtual\nenterprise, which tends to be coordinating type measures to ensure that the necessary\nlevel of coordination and synchronisation is achieved between individual enterprises.\nIn fact all four works (Gunasekaran et al 2001, SCOR v5, Beamon 1999, and Kochhar\nand Zhang 2002) propose a range a performance measures that may be appropriate in\nsupply chains, extended enterprises and virtual enterprises. Closer study of these works\nreveal that the majority of the measures proposed are not any different from measures\ntraditionally used in a single enterprise, but they are organised in a fashion to\ncorrespond to the supply chain (i.e. plan, source, make, deliver, etc). The exception to\nthis is the works by Gunasekaran et al (2001 and Kochhar and Zhang (2002) who\nBititci U S, Mendibil K, Albores P, Martinez M, 2005, \"Measuring and Managing Performance in Collaborative Enterprises\", International\nJournal of Operations and Production Management vol 25, no. 4 , pp 333-353, (ISSN 0144-3577).\n12\nidentified the need for Supply Chain Partnership Measures and Coordinating Measures\nrespectively.\nThis background study into performance measurement in extended enterprises\nconcluded that:\n\uf0b7 Extended Enterprise is a knowledge-based organisation, which uses the distributed\ncapabilities, competencies and intellectual strengths of its members to gain\ncompetitive advantage to maximise the performance of the overall extended\nenterprise.\n\uf0b7 None of the current strategic models and frameworks for performance measurement,\nsuch as Balanced Scorecard, Performance Prism, IPMS, Smart Pyramid etc\nconsider performance measurement and management from an extended enterprise\nperspective.\n\uf0b7 Other works into performance measurement in supply chains, extended enterprises\nand virtual enterprises specify a range of performance measures, which should be\nused in managing supply chains and virtual organisations but fail to integrate these\nwithin a strategic performance measurement framework.\n\uf0b7 Inter-enterprise coordinating (or partnership) measures are essential to ensure that\nvarious partners within an extended enterprise coordinate effectively and efficiently\nto ensure that the performance of the extended enterprise is maximised.\n\uf0b7 None of the current strategic models and frameworks for performance measurement\n(such as balanced scorecard, performance prism, IPMS and so on) explicitly\nconsiders the need for inter-enterprise coordinating measures.\n4. The Collaborative Architecture of an Extended Enterprise\nEarlier, the paper identified that performance measurement should be specific to\nbusiness units (Kaplan and Norton 2000a and 2000b, Neely et al 1996, Bititci et al\n1997).\nBititci U S, Mendibil K, Albores P, Martinez M, 2005, \"Measuring and Managing Performance in Collaborative Enterprises\", International\nJournal of Operations and Production Management vol 25, no. 4 , pp 333-353, (ISSN 0144-3577).\n13\nIn their work into developing a generic architecture for an integrated performance\nmeasurement system Bititci and Carrie (1998) adopted Beer's (1985) viable systems\nmodel and identified a cybernetic structure for a business (see also Bititci and Turner\n1999).\nIn essence, this work has described the competitive structure of any business that needs\nto be managed. This structure, which is illustrated in Figure 3b, may be summarised as:\n\uf0b7 The business exists to create wealth for its shareholder (or satisfy expectations of its\nkey stakeholders).\n\uf0b7 It achieves this by operating one or more business units that need to remain\ncompetitive in their selected markets to satisfy the needs of the business. Here a\nBusiness Unit is defined as the logical part of the business, which exists to\nservice a particular market sector with specific competitive requirements.\nBusiness Units may be product oriented or market oriented. In a product-oriented\nbusiness unit, it is the design characteristic of the product or product group that\ndetermines how the product competes in that market sector. In a market-oriented\nbusiness unit the same product may be subjected to different competitive pressures\nin different markets.\n\uf0b7 Each business unit competes by operating a number of value-add (operate)\nprocesses supported by the support processes. The efficiency and effectiveness of\nthese processes determines the competitiveness of the business units.\n\uf0b7 The efficiency and effectiveness of each business process is determined by the\ncombined performance of its critical activities.\nBititci U S, Mendibil K, Albores P, Martinez M, 2005, \"Measuring and Managing Performance in Collaborative Enterprises\", International\nJournal of Operations and Production Management vol 25, no. 4 , pp 333-353, (ISSN 0144-3577).\n14\nFigure 3. The competitive structure of a business.\nEarlier, the paper also identified that performance measurement systems should focus\non business processes that deliver value (EFQM 1998, Bititci et al 1997, Neely and\nAdams 2001). But in an extended enterprise these value-adding processes of each\nenterprise need to be joined end-to-end in a coordinated and synchronised manner. In\nshort, they need to behave as a single process end to end as depicted in Figure 4 below.\nThis concept is also strongly supported by other authors, such as Eloranta (1999) and\nHammer (2001).\nFigure. 4. The extended business processes.\nIn fact, Figure 4 simplifies the complexity of the environment within which an extended\nenterprise operates.

Although, at a superficial level, collaboration between firms may\nappear to take place at enterprise level, it is our hypothesis that;\n1. In reality, collaboration takes place at business unit level.\n2. In complex organisations, which may have several business units, each business\nunit may be part of a different collaborative system. Figure 5 illustrates this concept\nwhere enterprise E1 has three business units (BU1, BU2 and BU3). Each business\nunit is part of a different extended enterprise - depicted by arrows with different\npatterns.\nFigure 5. Architecture of extended enterprises.\nWithin the architecture presented in Figure 5, any one extended enterprise has to ensure\nthat the operate processes are extended across the enterprises within that extended\nenterprise, i.e. the extended business process model (Figure 4) arises at business unit\nlevel.\nFigure 6 illustrates the business process architecture of two separate extended\nenterprises comprising of five individual enterprises. This architecture is further\nexplained below:\n\uf0b7 All enterprises have two business units, with the exception of Enterprise 2, which has\nthree business units.\nE1\nBU1\nBU3\nBU2\nE2\nBU1\nBU3\nBU2\nE3\nBU1\nBU3\nBU2\nE4\nBU1\nBU3\nBU2\nE6\nBU1\nBU3\nBU2\nE5\nBU1\nBU3\nBU2\nBititci U S, Mendibil K, Albores P, Martinez M, 2005, \"Measuring and Managing Performance in Collaborative Enterprises\", International\nJournal of Operations and Production Management vol 25, no. 4 , pp 333-353, (ISSN 0144-3577).\n16\n\uf0b7 Business units 1.1 (Business Unit of Enterprise 1), 2.1 and 3.1 are joined together\nwith extended operate processes to form the Extended Enterprise 1.\n\uf0b7 Similarly, business units 5.1, 2.3 and 4.2 are joined together with extended operate\nprocesses to form the Extended Enterprise 2.\n\uf0b7 Enterprise 2 is playing a role in two different extended enterprises and is supporting\ntwo sets of extended operate processes.\n\uf0b7 The performance measurement literature suggests that each enterprise deploys its\nstrategic objectives to its business units and internal business processes - illustrated\nby arrows in Figure 6.\n\uf0b7 If we are to treat the extended enterprise as a single competitive entity under its own\nright as the extended enterprise literature suggests, then each extended enterprise\nshould have clearly defined strategic and performance objectives and that these\nneed to be deployed to its business units and extended processes.\n\uf0b7 Because the strategy of each business unit is deployed from two different sources,\ni.e. enterprise and extended enterprise, there is a potential source of conflict that\nneeds to be managed.\nFigure 6.

A meta-level manage process is required that links the strategy and performance\nobjectives to ensure that any potential conflicts between enterprise objectives and\nthe objectives of the extended enterprise are managed and, if possible, eliminated.\n4. A new performance measurement framework needs to be developed to facilitate this\nmeta-manage process by modifying the existing performance measurement\nframeworks to accommodate the architecture of the extended enterprise.\n5. CASE STUDY: Daks Simpson Limited\nSo far this paper demonstrates, through literature, that an extended enterprise is\nstructurally different and more complex compared to a single enterprise. It also\nconcluded that a strategic framework for measuring and managing performance in\nextended enterprises does not exist. The purpose of this case study is two fold. First, it\ndemonstrates the validity of the collaborative architecture developed, above, for\nextended enterprises. Then, the case study is used to develop a conceptual framework\nfor measuring and managing performance in extended enterprises.\nThe case data presented in this section was collected through a series of semi-\nstructured interviews and workshops with the management team of the case study\norganisation.\nDaks Simpson is an apparel manufacturer specialising in ladies' and gents' suits, jackets\nand trousers. The manufacturing facilities are based in Scotland with product design\nbased in London. The products are sold in a global market. Daks is a globally\nrecognised brand name with a significance presence in the Far-East market, particularly\nin Japan.\nIn practice, Daks has two business units, these are:\n\uf0b7 Brand Business, which specialises in the design, manufacture and sales of\nproducts under the Daks brand. These products are tailored garments produced to\nhigh specifications in limited quantities. Typically, a gent's suit may sell at \u00a3400 -\nBititci U S, Mendibil K, Albores P, Martinez M, 2005, \"Measuring and Managing Performance in Collaborative Enterprises\", International\nJournal of Operations and Production Management vol 25, no. 4 , pp 333-353, (ISSN 0144-3577).\n18\n\u00a3600 in one of Daks' stores or through one of their retailers, such as Fraser, Slater or\nHarrods in the UK and through Nordstrom in the US.\n\uf0b7 Contract Business which specialises in the design, manufacture and sales of\nproducts either under customers own labels, such as the St Michael label for Marks\nand Spencer, or for corporate wear under a customers name such as Bank of\nScotland. Compared to the garments produced for the Daks brand, these are much\nsimpler products sold in larger volumes. These are mass-produced rather than\ntailored in contrast to the Daks product range.\nTable 2 below illustrates the nature of the extended enterprise for each one of the\nbusiness units. The empirical data presented in this Table confirms the existence of two\ndifferent extended enterprises (or collaborative systems) within one enterprise.\nBititci U S, Mendibil K, Albores P, Martinez M, 2005, \"Measuring and Managing Performance in Collaborative Enterprises\", International\nJournal of Operations and Production Management vol 25, no. 4 , pp 333-353, (ISSN 0144-3577).\n19\nSuppliers Daks Simpson Customers Overall\nValue\nProposition\nDaks\nBusiness\nFashion designers\nand design\nhouses.\nInnovation in\nmaterials and new\ndesigns in\nmaterials (i.e.\npatterns)\nFlexibility of\nsupply, quality of\nmaterials.\nFlexibility of\nsupply, quality of\nproducts.\nFlexibility of supply\nDesigner-led product design\nwith emphasis on style, look\nand feel.

Here, for\nboth Extended Business Units, the two processes have been mapped in their extended\nforms to illustrate the value chain of each extended process, whilst the details of the\nprocesses internal to Daks have been suppressed. Figure 8 shows that the two\nextended processes have enterprises\/organisations that are both specific and common\nto both processes. For example, cloth suppliers, such as Arthur Bell, Nobles, Moon, etc.,\nhave a role to play in both the Product Development process and the Order fulfilment\nprocess. Whereas catwalks are specifically part of the extended product development\nprocess, the equipment suppliers and subcontractors are specifically part of the\nextended order fulfilment process.\nFigure 9 illustrates a much simpler picture for the Extended Contract Business Unit; this\nis not a surprise as this is a much simpler business unit where product variety is low and\nvolumes are high with relatively low product development activity. Although this is a\nmuch simpler extended business unit, structurally it demonstrates the same\ncharacteristics as the Extended Daks Business Unit.\nHowever, further analysis (not illustrated in Figures 8 and 9) also revealed that the\norganisations common to both extended processes are split internally. For example, in\nthe case of the extended Daks Business Unit, in one of the cloth suppliers (Nobles) there\nis a team of people who work closely with the designers in Daks on product development\nwhilst another team in Nobles is working closely with the order fulfilment team in Daks.\nFurthermore, the product development and the order fulfilment teams in Nobles are in\ncontinuous communication with their counterparts in Daks but they rarely communicate\nwith each other within Nobles. Our research established that this was a common\noccurrence in all those suppliers and customer who are involved in both order fulfilment\nand product development processes. That is the extended business processes seems to\nbe better integrated horizontally, i.e. between enterprises, then vertically, i.e. between\nprocesses within the same enterprise.\nBititci U S, Mendibil K, Albores P, Martinez M, 2005, \"Measuring and Managing Performance in Collaborative Enterprises\", International\nJournal of Operations and Production Management vol 25, no. 4 , pp 333-353, (ISSN 0144-3577).\n21\nFigure 8.

Measuring and Managing Performance in Extended Enterprises: A Model\nBased on the architecture of the extended enterprise as presented in Section 4 of this\npaper the research team developed the Extended Enterprise Performance Measurement\nModel, which is illustrated in Figure 10.\nFigure 10. The extended enterprise performance measurement model.\nIn Figure 10 the extended enterprise consists of a number of enterprises (three in this\ncase), which are collaborating. The readers should note that the extended enterprise\nemerges at the business unit level by linking the business units of number of different\nenterprises. The extended enterprise then comprises a number of extended business\nprocesses. Each extended business process is the integration of the business processes\nof individual enterprises.\nThe Extended Enterprise Performance Measurement Model (EEPMM) comprises of a\nseries of scorecards. These are:\nOperational\ncoordinating\nmeasures\nStrategic\ncoordinating\nmeasures\n1\n3\n2\n11\n3\n3\n3\nBititci U S, Mendibil K, Albores P, Martinez M, 2005, \"Measuring and Managing Performance in Collaborative Enterprises\", International\nJournal of Operations and Production Management vol 25, no. 4 , pp 333-353, (ISSN 0144-3577).\n24\n\uf0b7 Enterprise Scorecards, which are specific to each enterprise collaborating in the\nextended enterprise. Essentially, these are conventional strategic scorecards.\n\uf0b7 Business Unit Scorecard, corresponding to the collaborating business unit of an\nenterprise.\n\uf0b7 Business Process Scorecards (EB Sub-Process Scorecard), these are operational\nscorecards internal to each enterprise.\n\uf0b7 Extended Enterprise or Meta Level Scorecard, which includes strategic inter-\nenterprise coordinating measures\n\uf0b7 Extended Business Process Scorecards (EBP Scorecard), which includes\noperational inter-enterprise coordinating measures\nIn managing the performance of each enterprise the management team will be required\nto deploy the strategic objectives of the enterprise to it\u2019s own business units and\nbusiness processes (deployment path 1 in Figure 10).\nThe strategic objectives of extended enterprise will also be deployed to the business\nunits, which make up the extended enterprise (deployment path 2). This will be\nconsolidated with the objectives received from the enterprise and deployed through path\n1 to individual business processes.\nSimilarly, the strategic objectives of the extended enterprise would be deployed to its\nextended business processes and then to the sub-processes (i.e. part of the process\nthat is specific to an enterprise), as illustrated in deployment path 3.\nThis presents a complex structure for performance measurement and management in\nextended enterprises. In order to understand the consequences and practicality of such\na structure the research team applied this measurement model in the Extended Contract\nbusiness of Daks Simpson Plc. The results are as illustrated in Figure 11.\nBititci U S, Mendibil K, Albores P, Martinez M, 2005, \"Measuring and Managing Performance in Collaborative Enterprises\", International Journal of Operations and Production Management vol 25, no. 4 , pp\n333-353, (ISSN 0144-3577).\n25\nFigure 11.

Discussion and Conclusions\n7.1 Research Results and Lessons\nThis paper started with the argument that our limited understanding of how to measure\nand manage performance in extended enterprises is one of the main barriers to wide\nscale acceptance and practical use of the concept by industry and commerce.\nThe literature demonstrated that, although there is useful information on how Extended\nEnterprises should approach their business and operations strategy, planning and\ncontrol, performance measurement and so on, the guidance given remains either at a\nvery operational level (e.g. lists of performance measures that could be used in extended\nenterprises) or at a very generic level (e.g. under business strategy the compatibility of\nmembers are discussed) without providing a strategic framework on how the\nperformance and strategy of an external enterprise could be or should be managed.\nThe research, having developed a model for the collaborative architecture of the\nextended enterprise (Figure 6), demonstrated through a single case study, that an\nExtended Enterprise is structurally different than a single enterprise. That is:\n\uf0b7 Extended Enterprises functions at business unit level by connecting the business\nunits of number of different enterprises.\n\uf0b7 In an Extended Enterprise the business units are interdependent. In a single\nenterprise that has several business units, the business units are mutually exclusive,\ni.e. operationally they do not depend on one another and they are viable operations\nin their own right. In an extended enterprise the picture is quite different, here the\nbusiness units are depended upon each other, i.e. each business unit has to operate\nin strategic and operational synchrony with the other business units in the extended\nenterprise.\n\uf0b7 The Extended Enterprise comprises a number of Extended Operate Processes.\n\uf0b7 A meta-level manage process is required to manage the performance of the\nextended enterprise. This process would need to closely integrate with the manage\nprocesses of each enterprise.\nBititci U S, Mendibil K, Albores P, Martinez M, 2005, \"Measuring and Managing Performance in Collaborative Enterprises\", International\nJournal of Operations and Production Management vol 25, no. 4 , pp 333-353, (ISSN 0144-3577).\n28\nThe research concluded that, due to the above structural differences, the systems\nrequired to measure and manage the performance of extended enterprises, whilst being\nbased upon existing performance measurement frameworks and models, would be\nstructurally and operationally different.\nBased on the above conclusion, a model for measuring and managing performance in\nExtended Enterprises is proposed (Figure 10). The practical application of this model in\nthe Daks case study (Figure 11) led to the conclusions that, although complicated, it is\npossible to create a performance measurement framework to facilitate integrated\nmanagement of the extended enterprise, participating enterprises and their business\nunits and business processes. And that this framework leads to development of\ncoordinating measures that are:\n\uf0b7 Intrinsic as a result of deployment, e.g. profit measures along the Extended\nEnterprise or lead-time measures along the order fulfilment process relate to inter-\npartner lead-time measures proposed by Kochhar and Zhang (2002).\n\uf0b7 Extrinsic, such as \u201cnumber of inter-partner strategic conflicts\u201d (Kochhar and Zhang\n2002), which require to be consciously designed into the measurement system.\n7.2 Limitations and Further Research\nThe key limitations of the research described in this paper are:\n\uf0b7 The empirical evidence presented is based on a single case; further cases need to\nbe studied to establish the generalisibility of the above results.\n\uf0b7 The practical application of the EE performance measurement model was a paper\nbase exercise. To establish its practical limitations and usability an action research\nproject of longitudinal nature is required.\nDuring the research, the question whether Daks case study represented a typical\nExtended Enterprise was considered. As demonstrated earlier in this paper, there are\nvarious definitions of Extended Enterprise and there is indeed some confusion between\nSupply Chains, Extended Enterprises, Virtual Organisations and Collaborative\nEnterprises. In this paper our definition of en extended enterprise was based around\nbusiness processes that extend across a number of organisations. In this context we are\nBititci U S, Mendibil K, Albores P, Martinez M, 2005, \"Measuring and Managing Performance in Collaborative Enterprises\", International\nJournal of Operations and Production Management vol 25, no. 4 , pp 333-353, (ISSN 0144-3577).\n29\nconfidant that Daks case study represents a typical extended enterprise, as\ndemonstrated earlier the extended processes are better integrated horizontally then\nvertically.\nThe research teams appreciates that the findings presented in this paper are at the early\nstages of Meredith\u2019s (1993) research process, and the results should be seen as:\n\uf0b7 An initial observation of the limitations of the current knowledge in performance\nmeasurement in the context of extended enterprises.\n\uf0b7 An initial deduction, from literature, and explanation of a model for performance\nmeasurement and management in extended enterprises.\n\uf0b7 Initial testing and description of the validity of this model.\nReferences\nBeamon M., (1999): Measuring supply chain performance.
