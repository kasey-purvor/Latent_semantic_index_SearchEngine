Data from the Imaging Riometer for Ionospheric\nStudies (IRIS) at Kilpisja\u00a8rvi, Finland, have been compiled\nto form statistics of auroral absorption based on seven years\nof observations. In a previous study a linear relationship be-\ntween the logarithm of the absorption and the Kp index pro-\nvided a link between the observations of precipitation with\nthe level of geomagnetic activity. A better fit to the absorp-\ntion data is found in the form of a quadratic in Kp for eight\nmagnetic local time sectors. Past statistical investigations of\nabsorption have hinted at the possibility of using the solar\nwind velocity as a proxy for the auroral absorption, although\nthe lack of available satellite data made such an investigation\ndifficult. Here we employ data from the solar wind monitors,\nWIND and ACE, and derive a linear relationship between the\nsolar wind velocity and the cosmic noise absorption at IRIS\nfor the same eight magnetic local time sectors. As far as the\nauthors are aware this is the first time that in situ measure-\nments of the solar wind velocity have been used to create a di-\nrect link with absorption on a statistical basis. The results are\npromising although, it is clear that some other factor is neces-\nsary in providing reliable absorption predictions. Due to the\nsubstorm related nature of auroral absorption, this is likely\nformed by the recent time history of the geomagnetic activ-\nity, or by some other indicator of the energy stored within the\nmagnetotail. For example, a dependence on the southward\nIMF (interplanetary magnetic field) is demonstrated with ab-\nsorption increasing with successive decreases in Bz; a north-\nward IMF appears to have little effect and neither does the\neastward component, By .\nKey words.

Kavanagh\n(kavanagh@ucar.edu)\n1 Introduction\nUnderstanding the variation of High Frequency (HF) radio\nabsorption in the auroral zone is of great importance for de-\ntermining HF radio propagation conditions. Linking the ab-\nsorption to parameters measured in real time, such as the\nsolar wind velocity or interplanetary magnetic field (IMF)\norientation, can lead to improved prediction models. Many\nworkers have performed statistical studies of riometer ab-\nsorption in the past (e.g. Holt et al., 1961; Hartz et al., 1963;\nDriatsky, 1966; Hargreaves and Cowley, 1967) and the re-\nsults tend to confirm a diurnal variation in the absorption\npattern. Differences have arisen depending on the method\nof compiling the statistics (Hargreaves, 1969); by sampling\nabsorption at regular intervals a maximum in the morning\nsector is emphasized, whereas through identification of dis-\ncrete events a peak before magnetic midnight is highlighted.\nAbsorption sampled at too low a frequency will also de-\nemphasise the midnight peak. Similarly, different parameters\nhave been chosen to reproduce the morphology of the ab-\nsorption oval; these include the mean and median of the dis-\ntributions and the occurrence of absorption above a threshold\nlevel (e.g. 1 dB at a given riometer frequency) (Hargreaves,\n1966; Hargreaves and Cowley, 1967; Foppiano and Bradley,\n1985).\nIdentification of the occurrence of absorption has led to\nthe development of prediction models (e.g. Foppiano and\nBradley, 1983 and 1984) that depend both on MLT (magnetic\nlocal time) and the level of geomagnetic activity. Hargreaves\n(1966) examined quantitive relationships between observed\nabsorption and theKp andAp geomagnetic indices, and used\nthe limited available data to link the energy deposition to the\nsolar wind speed. This highlighted the dependence of ab-\nsorption on the solar wind speed, demonstrating an important\neffect in the coupling of interplanetary space phenomena to\nthe ionosphere.\nIn recent years regular monitoring of the solar wind con-\nditions has become available from the ACE (Advanced\n878 A.

In this\nstudy we use the in situ solar wind observations to consider\nthe link between cosmic noise absorption (CNA) and vari-\nations in the solar wind velocity and IMF orientation. The\ndependence of CNA on Kp is investigated with a new data\nset of seven years worth of narrow beam riometer observa-\ntions. An improvement over previous relationships is found,\nalthough the variation of absorption within a three-hour inter-\nval limits the use of such a relationship. As far as the authors\nare aware, for the first time direct satellite measurements are\nused to determine an empirical relationship between the ab-\nsorption and solar wind velocity. There is also a an unex-\npected general increase in CNA during southward IMF con-\nditions.\n2 Instrumentation\nThe Imaging Riometer for Ionospheric Studies (IRIS) at\nKilpisja\u00a8rvi, Finland (69.05\u25e6 N, 20.79\u25e6 E), began operations\nin September 1994, (Browne et al., 1995), based on a con-\ncept introduced by the University of Maryland (Detrick and\nRosenberg, 1990) of using a single phased array to generate\nimaging beams. Consisting of an array of 64 dipoles, the in-\nstrument produces 49 beams at various angles to the zenith\n(Fig. 1), as well as a single wide beam. Beam widths in the\nD-layer are of the order of 20 km wide near the zenith, be-\ncoming progressively wider with decreasing elevation angle.\nAll of the beams are sampled every second, although in the\nfollowing study the data are at averages greater than or equal\nto 10 min.\nFor this study the zenithal beam has been used to provide\ndata; the centre of this beam lies at 66.06\u25e6 magnetic latitude\nand 104.32\u25e6 magnetic longitude (altitude adjusted corrected\ngeomagnetic coordinate system (Baker and Wing, 1989)) in\na plane at 90 km altitude. The position has been calculated\nfor 1998 using the IGRF-2000 (International Geomagnetic\nReference Field) model. Data from the zenithal beam of the\nimaging riometer has an advantage over wide beam riome-\nters in that the integrated absorption is from a significantly\nsmaller portion of the sky (compare 12.6\u25e6 beam width with\n>60\u25e6) and thus giving a truer measure of the vertical absorp-\ntion.\nData from both the ACE (1998\u20132001) (McComas et al.,\n1998; Smith et al., 1998) and WIND (1995\u20131998) (Lep-\nping et al., 1995; Ogilivie et al., 1995) spacecraft have been\nused to provide measurements of the solar wind and inter-\nplanetary magnetic field. ACE was positioned at the first\nLagrangian point (L1), whereas WIND was performing a\nmore complicated orbit. A simple method of dividing the\nbowshock-spacecraft distance (in the GSM X-direction) by\nthe solar wind velocity to determine the delay time to the\nionosphere has been employed due to the large quantity of\ndata. From the bowshock (considered to be at 15RE) a fur-\nther 5 min is added to account for the propagation time to\nthe magnetopause and transmission into the magnetosphere.\nOccasions when high-speed streams overlap with slower so-\nlar wind have been removed from the data set rather than\nattempting to compute the complicated interactions.\n3 Observations\nIRIS data have been taken from the epoch 1995 to 2001 in-\nclusive, providing a maximum of 2557 days with 144 data\npoints (10-min. averages) in each. In practice data is lost due\nto maintenance time and hardware failures, accounting for\nless than 1% of the epoch. The most significant loss of data\nis due to contamination from solar radio emission (SRE) at\n38.2 MHz; this increases the received signal in the riometer\nabove the cosmic radio noise level. The absorption is calcu-\nlated by subtracting the received power from the quiet day\ncurve (QDC), representing the received cosmic noise power\non a day when there are no contributions to absorption from\nparticle precipitation. A percentile method (Browne et al.,\n1995) is used based on a minimum of 14 days of data to gen-\nerate QDC for IRIS, though this has been refined to work\nat higher resolutions and to remove the effects of SRE from\nthe QDC. For periods when the received power is boosted\nabove the quiet day level negative absorption values are cal-\nculated which are unrealistic. To combat the effects of this\nphenomenon data have been removed when absorption is\n<\u22120.2 dB in any beam; a level of \u22120.2 dB is implemented\nto account for uncertainties in the quiet day curves.\nFigure 2 displays the variation of median absorption for\nall magnetic local times calculated over 2000 days.

A distinct diurnal variation is immediately ap-\nparent with a peak in the pre-noon sector (09:00\u201310:00 MLT)\nand a deep minimum in the afternoon, close to dusk. The in-\nterquartile range is significantly higher at the maximum, with\nan increase in the upper quartile, indicative of a larger occur-\nrence of higher absorption.\nThe values depicted in Fig. 2 represent the whole span of\ndata; however, we are interested in understanding how that\ndiurnal variation changes with geomagnetic activity. By con-\nsidering the distribution of absorption at each level of Kp, in-\nformation on the dependence of absorption on geomagnetic\nactivity can be discerned. Figure 3 is composed of eight im-\nages displaying absorption against Kp for each local time in-\nterval. Occurrence is colour coded as a percentage of the total\nnumber of points in each time sector, with red being the high-\nest (4.5%) and black indicating zero; percentages are plotted\nto 0.1% accuracy. The white lines show the mean of the dis-\ntribution across the Kp bins in each time sector. Absorption\nhas been sorted into 0.1 dB bins and the data are plotted from\n0.1 to 2 dB, since all absorption higher than this falls well\nbelow the 0.1% occurrence level. In every case the highest\npercentage is at the lowKp values and close to 0 dB; negative\nvalues make up less than 4% of the total number of points at\neach local time. The 00:00\u201303:00 MLT plot indicates a tilt in\nthe data to higher absorption at higher Kp, but the absorption\nis lower than 0.7 dB. By 03:00\u201306:00 MLT the absorption has\nextended to 1 dB at the top end of the Kp range, though the\nmajority of absorption is within 0 to 0.4 dB. Absorption lev-\nels continue to increase until 09:00\u201312:00 MLT, when a max-\nimum of 1.7 dB at the 0.1% level is recorded.

From the 12:00\u201315:00 MLT time range the peak ab-\nsorption begins to shrink, but at 0.5 dB there is a broad spread\nof Kp values represented (1\u2212 to 6\u2212). At 15:00\u201318:00 MLT\nthe majority of absorption is below 0.5 dB, but by 21:00\u2013\n24:00 MLT there is a recovery in the expansion of the distri-\nbution. So with each successive time step from 00:00 MLT\nthe distribution extends to increasing absorption until 09:00\u2013\n12:00 MLT. After this the peak absorption recedes such that\nby 18:00\u201321:00 MLT the absorption is restricted to 0.5 dB\nacross the range of Kp. The absorption displays the greatest\ndynamic range at 09:00\u201312:00 MLT, and is most restricted\nat 18:00\u201321:00 MLT. The plotted mean values clearly show\nthe diurnal variation, particularly in the range 1+<KP<5\u2212.\nAbove this range the number of data points drops such that\nthe mean varies significantly with successive Kp bins instead\nof the smooth progression observed below KP=5\u2212.

The occurrence ranges from 0.01 to\n10% on a logarithmic colour scale. At each time interval the\nhighest occurrence is for low VSW and CNA <0.5 dB (down\nto the 1% occurrence level).

After midday (12:00\u201315:00 MLT) the ab-\nsorption distribution recedes, continuing this trend into the\nlate afternoon (16:00\u201318:00 MLT) where most of the absorp-\ntion is confined within 1.1 dB at all solar wind speeds.

Kp bins that contain less than 50 data points have been ex-\ncluded from contributing to the curve fitting.\n4 Discussion\n4.1 Diurnal variation\nThe local time dependence of absorption is a well-known\nphenomenon (e.g. Hartz et al., 1963). Previous studies found\nthat the strongest absorption occurs in the morning sector\nextending back towards midnight and slightly beyond. In-\nvestigations by Driatsky (1966) and Hargreaves and Cow-\nley (1967) demonstrated that the absorption close to mid-\nnight showed a peak rather than the smooth decay into the\nevening sector indicated by other studies. The relative size\nand appearance of the maxima (pre-noon and pre-midnight)\ndepends on the method by which the statistics are compiled\n(Hargreaves, 1969). Absorption in the pre-midnight sector is\nattributed to the precipitation of electrons directly associated\nwith substorm activity (e.g. Ansari, 1964; Ranta et al., 1981),\nand the precipitation in the morning sector has often been as-\nsociated with the eastward drift of electrons (Kavanagh et al.,\n2002 and references therein) following substorm injection.\nThus, it is the absorption around midnight that is considered\nTable 1.

Since the current study uses\n10-min resolution data to determine the mean values at each\nmagnetic local time, it is less sensitive to the short duration\n(\u22481\u20135 min) spikes, thus de-emphasizing the midnight peak.\nFigure 2 clearly demonstrates the diurnal variation observed\nin the central beam of IRIS; a strong morning peak following\na smooth rise from the pre-midnight sector. Gross features\nin the distributions should correlate well between individual\nstudies, however, any comparisons between the different sta-\ntistical studies must take into account the method by which\nthe data were collected.\n4.2 Geomagnetic control\nMagnetospheric influence on auroral absorption was estab-\nlished in the early days of riometry (e.g. Parthasarathy and\nReid, 1967). Figure 3 shows how with increasing MLT the\ndistribution spreads to higher absorption values at lower Kp\nuntil the afternoon when a recovery occurs. A relationship\nlinking geomagnetic activity with absorption for a given lo-\ncal time and latitude is desirable for prediction purposes. Past\nauthors have attempted to predict auroral radio absorption\nbased upon statistical measurements (e.g. Agy, 1972; Her-\nman and Vargas-Villa, 1972; Foppiano, 1975; Vondrak et\nal., 1978 and Foppiano and Bradley, 1984), including terms\nbased upon sunspot number, linking the absorption to the so-\nlar activity cycle. Hargreaves (1966) determined relation-\nships between the absorption and the Kp and Ap indices,\nand later works (Hargreaves et al., 1985, 1987) confirmed\nthis reliance on geomagnetic activity, suggesting that a geo-\nmagnetic term should replace the sunspot dependence in any\nprediction model.\nThe investigation by Hargreaves suggested a linear rela-\ntionship between the log of the median auroral absorption\nand Kp that was dependent on the time of day:\nlog10 Am = I + S.Kp (1)\nHargreaves used data from three riometers in the North-\nern Hemisphere: Great Whale River (55.03\u25e6, \u221277.83\u25e6\n882 A. J. Kavanagh et al.: The statistical dependence of auroral absorption\ngeographic), Baie St. Paul (47.37\u25e6, \u221270.55\u25e6) and Frobisher\nBay (63.80\u25e6, \u221268.70\u25e6) operating at 29.85 MHz. The two\nlower latitude stations are separated by 38 min of magnetic\nlocal time (Baie St. Paul leads Great Whale River), and the\ndata were binned into four ranges of universal time with val-\nues of the slope and intercept computed.\nFor this study magnetic local time (MLT) bins have been\nused rather than UT. This makes future comparisons with\ndata from other stations at different locations much simpler,\nand since absorption is related to substorm activity MLT de-\npendence is more likely than UT dependence. As shown in\nFig. 3 eight bands of magnetic local time have been chosen\nto bin the data, corresponding to those intervals over which\nKp is calculated. This demonstrated that there is a changing\ndistribution in the absorption at different levels of Kp in each\nmagnetic local time, with the scatter of absorption occupying\ndifferent ranges. Higher absorption is more likely at some\nmagnetic local times for a given Kp than at other intervals.\nFigure 6 plots the logarithm of the median and mean absorp-\ntion values for each Kp level for each MLT interval. The two\ncolour-coded lines display linear fits to the data for the mean\n(blue) and median (red) values, and the corresponding coeffi-\ncients are presented in Table 1. For Kp levels when less than\n50 data points occur in each local time bin, the mean and me-\ndian values are excluded from the fit. On either side of the\nmean values, the two dashed black lines show the positions\nof one standard deviation from the mean value; these give an\nindication of the spread of the data in each of the bins. The\ndifferences between the curves in successive time bins sug-\ngest that the local time dependence is very significant and so\nusing large temporal ranges (e.g. 6 h) is inadvisable. When\ncompared with the results of the investigation by Hargreaves\n(1966) the gradients of the fit appear reasonable (see Table 2).\nIRIS is positioned at a latitude between two of the riometers\nused in the previous study, tending towards the north end of\nthe separation and the gradients (when combined over 6 h)\ntend towards the northernmost values. Interestingly, the point\nwhere the values are markedly different is when the riometers\npass through the minimum in the diurnal variation. The ear-\nlier study used a time bin (18:00\u201324:00 UT) that spans the\nrapid decline to, and slow rise from, the minimum (13:00\u2013\n19:00 MLT). By weighting the latter half of the time period\nmore than the former, in combining the three-hour bins of\nthe present study, the gradients come into agreement. The\ndominance of the minimum is unsurprising considering the\nsmall effect that geomagnetic activity has on this recurring\nphenomenon, and it is a clear example of how careful selec-\ntion of temporal bins is essential to avoid smearing across\nvery different characteristics.\nIn order to test the accuracy of the fit the empirical equa-\ntions for the eight time sectors are applied to the Kp data\nfrom 1995 to 2001. Correlation coefficients are determined\nfor the observed and estimated absorption for both the mean\n(r=0.39) and median (r=0.36) cases, and the residuals are\nalso computed. The means of the residuals are both close to\nzero, with the median absorption lying closer (\u22120.002 dB)\nthan the mean (\u22120.017 dB). However, the standard devia-\ntions of the residuals in both cases demonstrate a wide vari-\nability between the observed and calculated CNA (0.238 dB\n(mean) and 0.263 dB (median)). At times the estimated ab-\nsorption is >1.7 times the observed value; for an observation\nof 0.5 dB this produces an error of 0.3 dB at 38.2 MHz. For\nlower frequencies the error becomes much greater (absorp-\ntion is approximately inversely proportional to the square\nof the observing frequency). Restricting the comparison to\nthose data that contribute to determining the empirical equa-\ntions further tests the correlation. For the range of data rep-\nresented by the well-defined mean and median values (>50\npoints in each bin), the correlation is much improved and the\nspread of the residuals reduces (s.d. \u22480.16 in both cases),\nsuggesting a better representation. The correlation coeffi-\ncient is still only 0.53, and more observations during periods\nof high activity should lead to a better fit of the data; how-\never, it should be considered that the variability of absorption\nin the Kp bins suggests that the statistical mean and median\nare poor predictors of auroral absorption. The dynamic range\nof the absorption distribution with Kp that is demonstrated in\nFig. 3 has already been mentioned, and this can be seen in the\nplots of Fig. 6 as well. To address the uncertainty associated\nwith the logarithmic relationship of the absorption, a differ-\nent empirical relationship is now suggested; a quadratic is\nfitted to the Kp:\nAm = aKp2 + bKp + c, (2)\nwhere a, b and c are constants listed in Table 3 for both the\nmean and median absorption. Figure 7 displays the local\ntime results of this fit to the data with good results over the\nrange of available data. The black dashed lines are the \u00b11\nstandard deviation from the mean for each Kp bin. 15:00\u2013\n18:00 MLT is at the minimum in the diurnal variation, and\nthe range of absorption values hardly increases as the ac-\ntivity level rises where the distribution of points suggests a\nlinear fit (e.g. A=bKp+c) that would be more appropriate\nthan the quadratic, and this has been implemented. When a\nquadratic form is used in this time sector it results in an un-\nphysical variation with rapidly decreasing absorption above\nKp=3. Neither the linear nor the squared term dominate to\na significant degree in each of the other time ranges, except\nin the 00:00\u201303:00 MLT and 12:00\u201315:00 MLT sectors. At\nthese times it is clear that the relationship is mostly linear\nwith a small nonlinear contribution at high Kp. Once again,\nthe fit will be improved when more data at the highest and\nlowest Kp values become available.\nTesting the relationship in the same manner as for the pre-\nvious example results in a notably higher correlation between\nthe observed and the calculated data (r=0.51). Also, the\nstandard deviation of the residuals decreases (s.d.\u00af0.18 dB).\nRestricting the comparisons to the data that contribute to the\nfit leads to a slight improvement (r=0.54, s.d. \u22480.16 dB).\nThus, the logarithmic fit seems to represent the absorption\nthat contributes to the fit almost as well as the quadratic fit,\nalthough we can speculate that the quadratic may be closer\nto the true relationship as it has more success in calculating\nthe CNA beyond the range of fitting.\nA.

This does not\nexclude high absorption events by any means, but even with\nhigh values of Kp there will be many occasions when ab-\nsorption is low; similar geomagnetic conditions will not nec-\nessarily return similar absorption levels. When the nature of\nauroral absorption is considered this becomes less surpris-\ning; radio absorption at high latitudes is principally due to\nthe precipitation of energetic particles (electrons of energy\n>15 keV), and if no such particle population exists on the\nappropriate magnetic field lines, then no absorption will be\nobserved. Thus, for periods of high geomagnetic activity in\nclose succession the high-energy particle population may be\ndepleted for a time, leading to a significantly reduced absorp-\ntion level. Alternatively, a lack of absorption may be a local\neffect due to an equatorward displacement of the absorption\noval as a consequence of an expanded polar cap. In order to\nmake reliable absorption predictions, some term dependent\non the recent time history of the magnetic activity must be\nincluded in any empirical relationship. This is not included\nwithin this paper and instead will be the subject of a future\nstudy.\nAnother important point to note is the variability of ab-\nsorption on small time scales, especially in the night side\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n00\u221203 MLT\nKp\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n03\u221206 MLT\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n06\u221209 MLT\nKp\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n09\u221212 MLT\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n12\u221215 MLT\nKp\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n15\u221218 MLT\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n18\u221221 MLT\nKp\nAbsorption (dB)\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n21\u221224 MLT\nAbsorption (dB)\nFig. 7.

(2001) noted that long after the passage of in-\nterplanetary shocks in two separate events, there was an ap-\npreciable aurora at dawn, dusk and midnight, recorded by the\nUltra Violet Imager carried by the Polar spacecraft. This was\nattributed to a viscous interaction between the solar wind and\nthe flanks of the magnetosphere, producing either a Kelvin\nHelmholtz instability (Rostoker et al., 1992) or cross-field\ndiffusion of magnetosheath plasma via ELF\/VLF boundary\nlayer wave interactions (Lakhina et al., 2000; Tsurutani and\nLakhina, 1997). Either way, small changes in the dynamic\npressure, brought about through slight variations in the so-\nlar wind speed, could result in increased precipitation; this\nis demonstrated in Fig. 4, where the increased level of solar\nwind velocity produces large changes in the mean absorp-\ntion in the morning and midnight sectors, though the major-\nity of absorption clusters about 0.1 dB. Once again, there is a\nstrong minimum of the mean CNA in the afternoon\/evening\nsector (15:00\u201321:00 MLT), and it is unaffected by the in-\ncreasing solar wind velocity. At high VSW the distribution\nappears to narrow again, but this is an artfact created by low\nnumbers of data points at the greater speeds. Since the solar\nwind is credited as being the driving force behind geomag-\nnetic activity, it seems reasonable to link the absorption to\nthe energy input from the solar wind. The study by Harg-\nreaves (1966) attempted to estimate the total energy of pre-\ncipitated particles. This relied on the empirical relationship\nderived by Hargreaves and Sharp (1965), linking the absorp-\ntion to the square root of the total energy of the precipitated\nelectrons, combined with an expression for the solar wind\nvelocity based on Kp and Ap. Measurements of the solar\nwind were made by the Mariner 2 space probe to derive this\nrelationship (Snyder et al., 1963). With the data available\nfrom the ACE and WIND spacecraft it is possible to attempt\nto link auroral absorption directly with the solar wind veloc-\nity. By compiling mean and median absorption values from\n50 km\/s wide bins, a similar method to the previously imple-\nmented procedure can be applied to the data. Figure 8 shows\nthe results of the binning with a linear fit to the data of the\nform:\nAm = aVSW + b (3)\nValues for the coefficients a and b are presented in Table 4.\nThe data distribution in the pre-noon sector shows some non-\nlinearity, but this is not repeated to any notable effect in the\nother local time bins and does not compare with that recorded\nfor the Kp bins. The correlation coefficients (r=0.48) sug-\ngest a better result than for the original Kp fit, and the stan-\ndard deviation of the residuals (0.19 dB) is comparable with\nthose of the quadratic relationship in Kp. When the relation-\nship is computed for only those velocities where more than\n50 data points are used to calculate mean and median val-\nues, there is no discernable difference in the correlation. The\ncurrent Eq. (3) will produce unrealistic values for low solar\nwind velocities (<200 km\/s) in most cases; however, in the\nprevious half solar cycle there have been no occurrences of\nthe solar wind dropping below\u2248250 km\/s. Values of absorp-\ntion calculated for a solar wind velocity less than 250 km\/s\nshould be discounted as extremely unreliable as should val-\nues in excess of 800 km\/s. It is highly likely that at large\nvelocity, other mechanisms of absorption, such as the sud-\nden commencement absorption (SCA) and sudden impulse\nabsorption (SIA) (Brown et al., 1961; Brown and Driatsky,\n1973), will dominate.\nBy fitting a quadratic equation as with the Kp the correla-\ntion changes by only a small amount, and similar results are\nobtained from comparing the logarithm of the speed and the\nabsorption (e.g. r=0.49). Thus, the simple linear fit to the\nsolar wind data seems to be the best that can be achieved but\nresults in a relatively weak correlation. It is believed that the\nimportant factor that is necessary to improve upon these re-\nsults is to combine the effects of the IMF (discussed below)\nwith that of the solar wind and to include some term that\ntakes account the recent time history of the solar wind\/IMF.\nThis \u201cpriming\u201d factor would be related to the storing of en-\nergy in the magnetotail prior to release during substorm on-\nset. Much further work is needed before a reliable prediction\nmodel for auroral absorption can be created based on a so-\nlar wind parameter, though existing absorption models (e.g.\nFoppiano and Bradley, 1983; Greenberg and La Belle, 2002)\nhave changed from using a solar cycle related term (usually\nsunspot number) to a geomagnetic dependent value.\n4.4 IMF contributions\nAnother factor is the role played by the IMF. Figure 5 showed\nthat a southward IMF affects the absorption, which is unsur-\nprising given that this has a general effect on the geomag-\nnetic activity. A southward IMF leads to absorption increases\nin the morning and midnight, sectors whereas it once again\nA. J.

A westward IMF ap-\npears to favour an increase in absorption over midnight and\ninto the morning sector, perhaps due to the skewing of the\nfield lines (Cowley et al., 1991), leading particles to precip-\nitate at an earlier local time. To determine whether this is\nsignificant on a statistical level the data are subjected to the\nKolmogorov-Smirnov significance test (Von Mises, 1964),\nwhich tests the hypothesis that two samples are drawn from\nthe same distribution. A significance probability, SP, <0.01\nsuggests that the samples come from significantly different\ndistributions. For positiveBy , north and southward IMF have\nbeen compared. The results show a SP <0.01 from 20:00 to\n12:00 MLT, suggesting that the data in this band are from\nvery different distributions. Midnight and morning absorp-\ntion is highly dependent on the IMF, and the low absorption\nvalues in the afternoon\/evening are not; this reinforces the\nobservations that the minimum does not change with either\nKp or VSW.

A north-\nward IMF does not affect the absorption, whereas increasingly neg-\nativeBz increases the level of absorption during the night and morn-\ning sectors.\nity of By having an effect on the absorption. Discarding the\nBy parameter as insignificant for these purposes, the zenithal\nabsorption can be binned by Bz, in order to further investi-\ngate the dependence. Figure 9 shows that when the mean\nabsorption is binned by Bz there is a definite effect for nega-\ntive values, both around midnight and in the morning sector.\nOnce again the field strength does not affect the level of the\nminimum. In addition a northward IMF does not seem to\nradically affect the absorption as southward does; the curves\nfor positive Bz cluster below a 0.25 dB maximum, with lit-\ntle difference between each range. Those curves for Bz<0\ndisplay a definite trend with increasingly higher values of ab-\nsorption for successively negative values of Bz. Thus, the ab-\nsorption distribution is obviously dependent on theZ compo-\nnent of the IMF, just as should be expected, since absorption\nis substorm dependant. This approach does not account for\ntransient effects in the absorption, such as those reported by\nNishino et al. (1999) for a rectified response to north\/south\nturnings in the IMF. That example was related to increases\nin field-aligned currents close to the open\/closed field line\nboundary, whereas the general increase here is likely related\nto the occurrence of substorm activity for negative IMF.\nAn inspection of the IMF Bz versus the solar wind speed\n(data not shown) shows no bias in the data, so high velocities\noccur for both positive and negative Bz. It should be possible\nto develop a relationship for the dependence of absorption\non the IMF that could further be improved by separating the\neffects of the solar wind speed. This would go a long way\nto establishing a more accurate model for predicting auroral\nabsorption and will be the subject of a future study.\n4.5 The diurnal minimum\nA recurring and intriguing phenomenon in the statistical au-\nroral absorption is the presence of the diurnal minimum.\n886 A. J. Kavanagh et al.: The statistical dependence of auroral absorption\nFigure 2 demonstrated the large decrease in absorption at\naround 18:00 MLT. Similarly, when the data are binned by\nKp the minimum is recurring, always reaching down to\n\u223c0.15 dB. In fact, this occurs for every level of solar wind\nspeed (e.g. Fig. 4) and also the for IMF (Fig. 5). There is no\nsignificant difference between the distributions at the mini-\nmum when comparing north and south-directed IMF; quite\nobviously, the minimum is unaffected by geomagnetic, solar\nwind or IMF activity. The exact mechanics behind the diur-\nnal minimum are beyond the scope of this study; suffice to\nsay that the minimum is a recurring statistical phenomenon\nthat is likely related to a combination of the loss of drift-\ning electrons (through earlier precipitation and radial diffu-\nsion) and the remaining population becoming stably trapped\nin the magnetosphere. For this study it is only necessary to\nacknowledge the existence of the minimum as a limiting case\non the local time dependence of the relationship between ab-\nsorption and Kp and the solar wind velocity.\n5 Conclusions\nData have been combined from 7 years of continuous ob-\nservations of the auroral absorption from a single imaging\nriometer (IRIS) using the narrow zenithal beam to investi-\ngate the dependence of absorption on geomagnetic and solar\nwind parameters. 1995 to 2001 covers the ascending phase\nof solar cycle 23. The narrow beam offers a better estimate\nof the height-integrated absorption over broad beam riome-\nter observations, since it integrates over a smaller portion of\nthe sky. Through the sorting of absorption into bins of corre-\nsponding Kp a quadratic empirical relationship between the\ntwo parameters is derived and provides a better correlation of\ncalculated and observed absorption than the linear fit based\non the logarithm of the absorption. The local time depen-\ndence of absorption is so clear that the possibility that differ-\nent types of fits to the data in each MLT bracket should not\nbe discounted. Any future investigation of this nature should\ntake this into account.\nFor the first time a linear relationship between the solar\nwind velocity and the auroral absorption has been derived.\nThis is based upon direct solar wind observations rather than\nestimates based on the Kp index. Combining the observa-\ntions results in a reasonable correlation; however, it is clear\nthat some other factor must play a role in the relationship.\nIt appears that a southward-orientated IMF plays a signifi-\ncant role in precipitation in the auroral zone, but the eastward\ncomponent does not have a statistical effect on the mean ab-\nsorption. Deriving a relationship between Bz and absorption\nafter the effects of the solar wind speed have been removed\nwill be the focus of a future study.\nThe afternoon\/evening minimum in the diurnal vari-\nation of absorption appears to be a strongly consis-\ntent phenomenon. Absorption virtually disappears around\n18:00 MLT regardless of the geomagnetic, solar wind or IMF\nactivity. This is likely related to the loss of the bulk of drifting\nparticles. The remaining flux of electrons is probably lower\nthan the critical flux necessary for whistler-mode instability\nthat drives enhanced precipitation in the dayside magneto-\nsphere (Kennel and Petschek, 1966; Coroniti and Kennel,\n1970). The mechanisms of this effect are beyond the scope of\nthe current study, and for the purposes of prediction it is only\nnecessary to acknowledge the fact that the minimum occurs.\nAlthough apparently reasonable fits to the mean and me-\ndian absorption can be found for both Kp and the solar wind\nspeed, the variability of the absorption still leads to prob-\nlems. Low absorption is still likely even when geophysical\nactivity is high, since absorption is highly dependent on the\npopulation of energetic particles in the magnetosphere; with-\nout fluxes of electrons (energies >15 keV) no appreciable\nabsorption is possible. Thus current, global models of ab-\nsorption based on only Kp values are somewhat unreliable.\nMethods to improve such a model must take into account past\nlevels of geomagnetic activity, absorption and some other\nmeasure of the energy stored in the magnetotail (e.g. Bz). A\ndetailed study of how absorption responds during geomag-\nnetic storms would be especially useful, linking the observa-\ntions to past levels of activity, as indicated not only by Kp\nand Dst but also by the IMF and solar wind speed. If this is\ndone then with the large array of riometers available in both\nhemispheres and the catalogue of data, a suitable global em-\npirical prediction model could be defined.\nAcknowledgements.
