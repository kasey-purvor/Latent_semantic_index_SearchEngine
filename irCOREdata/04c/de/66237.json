During the Second World War,it came to play a significant role in defining the new social positioning\nresultant from the cultural construct of the \u201cpeople\u2019s war.\u201d At a time when British\npropagandists concentrated on the image of the \u201cordinary\u201d man and woman and,\nin particular, their integration within the organic whole, the problem of social\nidentity was brought into sharp focus, representing the nation reconfigured. In\nattempting to connect the wider populace with the war effort and the drive for\nunity, propagandists knew that representations of the \u201cordinary\u201d had to be realistic,\ncreating an individualized, personal identification with the role of the \u201ceveryman\u201d\nand foregrounding \u201chis\u201d experience. Naturally, accent and language played a key\nrole in this process, featuring prominently in appeals set within the \u201cpeople\u2019s\nJo Fox is a senior lecturer in modern history at the University of Durham.

While much scholarly work has dealt with the image of the\n\u201cpeople\u2019s war\u201d in British cinema from 1939 to 1945 and beyond, little comment\nhas been made on the pervasive role of dialect, accent, and scripting.\nThis article seeks to redress this omission by analyzing some of the ways in\nwhich cinema explored the ordinary, seizing upon the importance of accent and\nlanguage in attempting to create a realistic portrait of Britain at war. Rather than\ntesting the authenticity of the images presented to the British public, it analyzes\nthe motives of the filmmakers, examining the ways in which dialogue was used in\ndocumentary and fictional film productions. It also explores how filmmakers used\nlinguistic methods in cinema portraits of the \u201caverage hero\u201d and the problems\nthat producers encountered in trying to do so. The study reveals the development\nof the image of the ordinary within the master narrative of the people\u2019s war and\nhighlights the innate connection between the cinematic documentary movement\nand its commercial counterpart.\nSome studies contend that both the nontheatrical and theatrical documentary\nand the fictional feature operated within parallel contexts but on separate paths.\nHowever, by viewing the two forms of cinema as interconnected, this article seeks\nto challenge the view that \u201cthe real propaganda war was carried out in the com-\nmercial cinema [and] . . . not in any significant way by the documentary film.\u201d3\nIt was the documentary movement that gave cinematic identity to the popular\nconception of class, regional, and gender constructs. In turn, this profoundly\ninfluenced the development of images of the ordinary and the people\u2019s war artic-\nulated within the fictional feature. Although the documentary film, on the whole,\nreached far fewer viewers than fictional studio productions, the adoption of doc-\numentary principles by commercial filmmakers demonstrated a willingness to adapt\nto the fluctuating needs of a society at war. Contrary to Nicholas Pronay\u2019s view\nthat \u201cas far as the war effort was concerned,\u201d the documentary film \u201ccould have\n[been] dispensed with . . . without an iota of difference,\u201d the basic cultural codes\nit reflected, specifically in the representation of social identifiers, laid the foun-\ndations for the most popular cinematic expressions of the ordinary within British\nfictional wartime cinema.4 The use of accent and language was one of the most\nimportant devices in the formation of both the collective experience and individual\nidentities, and this article seeks to examine first the construction of accented lan-\nguage within the documentary form and then to demonstrate how basic principles\nof this process were integrated into mainstream cinema.\nIt is difficult to judge precisely the success of this development in cinematic\ntrends in creating a cultural environment for social change and the internalization\nof new forms of collective identity. In 1940, Tom Harrisson, one of the founders\nof Mass-Observation, an organization dedicated to analyzing the popular voice,\nidentified three levels of opinion prevalent in modern societies: published, public,\nand private. Although, as Harrisson recognized, private opinion is the most desired\nby observers and historians, it is also the most difficult to access. It is improbable\nthat, as Harrisson claimed, Mass-Observation could get close to penetrating the\nprivate world of the cinemagoer: \u201cWatching audience responses,\u201d he contended,\n3 Nicholas Pronay, \u201c\u2018The Land of Promise\u2019: The Projection of Peace Aims in Britain,\u201d in Film and\nRadio Propaganda in World War II, ed. K. R. M. Short (London, 1983), 72.\n4 Ibid.\nMILLIONS LIKE US? \u0002 821\n\u201cgives the same sort of information about what is really going on in people\u2019s minds\nas we get from intimate war diaries, or dream studies.\u201d5 Nonetheless, the \u201cdark-\nness\u201d of the theater undoubtedly provided \u201cthe privacy in which people could\nreact as individual[s]\u201d as well as within a group. Films themselves revealed \u201can\nimmense range of human [situations, presenting] to the audience a great variety\nof emotional problems\u201d to which reactions could be noted and analyzed.6 Such\nanalysis was conducted by Mass-Observation, whose archives contain both broader\nresponses to the film program and more specific reactions, such as the pattern of\ncoughing or laughter in theaters.\nAlthough Mass-Observation has been subject to continued scrutiny as to the\nreliability of its materials for the modern scholar, it should be remembered that\nits reports were not meant to be read as quantitative data. Rather, they were\nobservations of everyday life.7 That Mass-Observers were recording life not nec-\nessarily as it was but rather as they and their subjects perceived it to be is helpful\nto the scholar attempting to understand popular attitudes to film and to propa-\nganda constructs such as the image of the collective or the ordinary. Historians\nof Britain in the Second World War have seen this as the primary advantage of\nthe collection, since the depth of its material \u201cwith its concurrent ambiguities,\nnuances and contradictions, [provides] a far richer account than the snap reaction\nto an opinion poll question.\u201d8 This undercurrent of tensions within prevailing\npopular opinions is particularly relevant to the study of film, pointing to multiple\ndesires on the part of the average cinemagoer and the complexities of patterns of\naudience response.\nIn addition, published information from trade newspapers, such as Kinemato-\ngraph Weekly and Today\u2019s Cinema, gives the historian an insight into the perceptions\nof trends in the industry from within. Of these publications, Documentary News\nLetter is the most controversial but also the most valuable for the historian seeking\na window into the minds of those leading the documentary movement. Appearing\nfor the first time in January 1940, this periodical clamored for recognition of film\nas an art form above the commercial product. Its writers consistently pressured\nthe Ministry of Information and its Films Division to view film as a force in social\neducation, and they complained that the trade press had erected artificial bound-\naries between entertainment and propaganda. This attitude began to erode the\nfalse distinction placed upon these two cinematic forms and led to what Andrew\nHigson terms \u201cthe wartime wedding\u201d between the documentary and the fictional\nfeature.9 Nowhere was this marriage more keenly observed than in the represen-\ntation of the ordinary and in the use of authentic accented language.\n5 M-O A: File Report (hereafter FR) 446, Tom Harrisson, \u201cSocial Research and the Film,\u201d November\n1940.

In the cinema, accent and\nlanguage came to signify social status, just as much as sets, milieus, and costumes\ndid. Class was no longer codified solely by visual clues, for authentic speech placed\ncharacters \u201cboth geographically and socially.\u201d Accent, syntax, and \u201crestricted [and\nelaborate] speech codes\u201d created collective recognition of a character\u2019s status\nwithin a particular film and became an important tool for the filmmaker in the\nfashioning of a class- or region-specific scenario.11 Significantly, sound also opened\nup broader distinctions between nations. The sound film highlighted the percep-\ntion among the British public that accented language in American feature films\nrepresented a significant difference between American and British attitudes toward\nclass.12 Although the American accent would have potentially indicated status to\ncinemagoers in the United States, British audiences had little experience of cultural\nand social nuance within the American idiom. As George Perry observed of British\nfilms of the 1930s, \u201cThe British cinema had become a middle-class institution: it\nwas the \u2018cultured\u2019 West-End accent that was heard and it was the mores of the\ncountry drawing room that were being observed. In Middlesbrough and Smeth-\nwick they opted for the classless accents of America, just as they preferred the\nslicker pace and the glossier technique.\u201d13 In short, throughout the 1930s, the\nmost popular accent in film was \u201cAmerican.\u201d As Winifred Holtby\u2019s fictional piece\nSouth Riding (1936) suggested, there was a growing awareness of language and\nits relationship to cinematic and broader cultural change. She wrote of her pro-\ntagonist that \u201clike most of her generation and locality, Elsie was trilingual. She\ntalked BBC English to her employer, Cinema American to her companions and\nYorkshire dialect to old milkmen.\u201d14\nHowever, Tony Aldgate has pointed to evidence from the early 1930s that\nimplies that \u201cthe public at first found . . . American accents bewildering,\u201d causing\nthem to miss much of the dialogue.15 This problem was particularly acute among\nworking-class and northern cinemagoers, who \u201cexercised a strong suspicion, not\nto say hatred, of the American idiom.\u201d16 Nevertheless, as audiences became ac-\n10 John Ellis, \u201cVictory of the Voice?\u201d Screen 22, no. 2 (1981): 69\u201372, 70.\n11 Philip Gillett, The British Working Class in Post-war Film (Manchester, 2003), 19\u201320.\n12 Sue Harper and Vincent Porter, British Cinema of the 1950s: The Decline of Deference (Oxford,\n2003), 251.\n13 George Perry cited in Charles Barr, Ealing Studios, 3rd ed.

As McKibbin commented, \u201cMost widely dis-\nliked [among audiences] was the accent of the actors and, even more, the actresses.\nThe talkie had cruelly exposed the British film. There were almost immediate\ncomplaints about the \u2018prissiness\u2019 and the \u2018stageyness\u2019 of the diction, of \u2018by joves\u2019\nand \u2018I says\u2019, \u2018Oxford accents\u2019 and \u2018BBC voices\u2019.\u201d17 With the voice of the stage\nrather than the screen came an awareness among the cinemagoing public that\nBritish film actors were less realistic than American actors and that their dialogue\nwas \u201c\u2018on a scale and tempo\u2019 that might be acceptable in the theatre but not in\nthe cinema.\u201d18 Moreover, accented language exposed a gulf between the \u201cOxford\u201d\ncharacters on screen and the largely working-class cinemagoers in the United\nKingdom.19\nIn this new environment, working-class regional accents in film were well re-\nceived by the British public, as demonstrated by the fact that Lancashire legends\nGeorge Formby and Gracie Fields were among the most popular stars of stage\nand screen from about 1937 to 1943.20 Throughout their film careers, their accents\nremained \u201cas thick and strong as hotpot.\u201d The popular songs drawn from film\nand other performances were \u201cbuilt around dialect expressions\u201d; \u201cA Lad fra Lan-\ncashire,\u201d \u201cEee by Gum,\u201d and \u201cOwt about Nowt\u201d are but a few examples.21 Formby\nand Fields\u2019s heavy regional accent in part fulfilled the public\u2019s desire to hear a\nvariety of dialects that grounded both character and plot and also tapped into the\ngeneral public\u2019s fondness for the music hall style. Formby and Fields performed\na specific function within the United Kingdom in providing a focal point for\nidentity and a comfort to audiences in the 1930s and 1940s. Film critic C. A.\nLejeune noted that \u201cour George, like our Gracie, stands for something strong and\ntough and homely in a jittery world.\u201d22 In this sense, their appeal went far beyond\nthe northwest of England: \u201cFields and Formby were more than simply Lancashire\nstars. They became national stars . . . [and] symbols of the people.\u201d23 Given that\n\u201ceach individual has a multiple set of identities which operate at different times\nand under different circumstances,\u201d it was entirely conceivable that cinemagoers\ncould \u201cassociate with local, regional, national, social, class, ethnic, religious and\ngender identities . . . and yet hold common British affiliation,\u201d the most popular\nstars achieving \u201ctheir popularity by appealing to all of these multiple identities.\u201d24\n17 McKibbin, Classes and Cultures, 433.\n18 Ibid.\n19 The National Archives: Public Record Office (hereafter TNA: PRO) RG 23\/44, Wartime Social\nSurvey, DC 48532\/1.\n20 Cinema, 1 January 1941, 5.

It was in this environment that linguistic devices within\ncinematic productions came to be a key means of constructing the image of\npeople\u2019s war.28 This appeal across class and regional divides overturned trends in\nthe use of accented language within film. The experiments with sound in the 1930s\nled to a polarization of representation on the screen. Although \u201cOxford-English\u201d\nwas preferred by the studios because of its audibility and perceived classlessness,\nit was still the accent of the \u201cmetropolitan urban upper-middle class,\u201d with its\n\u201cextra inflection towards clarity and enunciation.\u201d Such \u201cclass-bound\u201d accents\nwere consistently used for \u201cserious dramatic material, for light comedy, for newsreel\ncommentaries, for documentary voice-overs,\u201d whereas the music hall, regional\nvoice was reserved for \u201clow-budget\u201d low comedy.29 In this way, \u201cregional and\nclass differences were deviations measured from the basis of stage standard English,\nand could only appear in the guise of minor and\/or comic characterizations.\u201d30\nThe result was that, during the 1930s, \u201ca hierarchy of voice was instituted: stage\nstandard English could speak facts and emotions, anything serious and of impor-\ntance; the various representations of regional accents (themselves tempered by the\nneed for universal intelligibility) could speak only that which revealed a limited\nunderstanding.\u201d31 The Second World War, and specifically the cultural construct\nof the people\u2019s war, necessitated a change, demanding the dominance of \u201cau-\nthenticity\u201d over \u201cclarity\u201d and foregrounding regional and class identities. During\nthe Second World War, both the media and the propaganda service used more\nvaried accents in their attempt to create a culture applicable to all. The British\nBroadcasting Corporation (BBC) was the key innovator in this respect. The war-\ntime broadcasting service \u201cmade a conscious effort to broadcast nationally a com-\n25 Sedgwick, Popular Filmgoing, 111\u201312, 119.\n26 For comments on the popularity of Formby, see ibid., 192\u201393.\n27 Richards, Films and British National Identity, 261.\n28 TNA: PRO INF 1\/724, memorandum by the International Broadcasting and Propaganda En-\nquiry, 21 June 1939.

E. M. Joad, panelist for the Brains Trust, commented in April 1942.33 The\nmost popular broadcasters of the day, such as J. B. Priestley and Wilfred Pickles,\nhad soft regional accents and proved to be extremely popular with audiences\nlooking for representations of the ordinary. Despite some complications, such as\nthe English and Welsh being unable to understand some regional dialects such as\nHighland Scottish, the BBC became adept at \u201cletting the people speak for them-\nselves,\u201d or, at the very least, creating the appearance of such. This challenged both\nthe traditional \u201cBBC English\u201d that had become standard fare before the outbreak\nof war and the dominance of the intellectual elites. As W. E. Williams, director of\nthe Army Bureau of Current Affairs, commented, \u201cThe Brahmins who bother\ntheir heads about the morale of the working classes could learn confidence and\npossible humility if they listened now and then, on the air and off it, to the authentic\nVoice of the People.\u201d34\nBy 1942, realism and the ordinary had become a key method of communicating,\nin a meaningful way, with the \u201ceveryman.\u201d The BBC recognized that \u201cit is the\nman who has an accent who carries conviction.\u201d35 Accent was increasingly used\nby the BBC as a means of creating a sense of inclusivity, an indication that broad-\ncasts were intended to convey the sense of \u201cour\u201d war. Broadcasters were conscious\nof the need to explore and accept class and regional diversity, tapping into the\npublic desire to identify with the messages they received from the media and official\norgans of publicity. In attempting to diversify the range of dialects on the radio,\nthe BBC conformed to government objectives relating to the propaganda of the\npeople\u2019s war. In April 1941, the Home Publicity Sub-committee of the Ministry\nof Information, Britain\u2019s wartime propaganda agency, recognized that it was nec-\nessary to \u201cinspire and sustain a feeling of close identity between people and gov-\nernment in order to avoid the danger of sections of the home public getting into\nthe habit of thinking in terms of \u2018their\u2019 war instead of \u2018our\u2019 war.\u201d36 They rec-\nommended that home publicity should mount a \u201cpropaganda offensive,\u201d using\nthe idea of the people\u2019s war as a central theme.37\nFilm was viewed as an essential medium for this purpose. As it was one of the\nmost popular forms of entertainment and communication among the wider masses,\nit had a good chance of reaching those that the ministry wished to target. The\nWartime Social Survey of 1943 found that \u201cin the lower economic group the\nproportion of frequent cinema goers is higher.\u201d Cinema was specifically adept at\nattracting \u201chigh proportions of workers in light manufacturing and in the clerical,\ndistributive and miscellaneous groups [who] go to the cinema once a week or\n32 Nicholas, The Echo of War, 239.\n33 C.

Cinema was also a good means\nof communicating to regional audiences, with the survey concluding that \u201cthe\nNorth region . . . shows a high proportion of frequent cinema goers.\u201d38 Docu-\nmentary News Letter proclaimed in November 1940: \u201cFilm has a special capability\nto provide a long-term vision by rendering in visual form the basic ideas and needs\nof a generation.\u201d Film, it claimed, could \u201cdo an immense amount to bridge the\nlong-criticized gap between bureaucracy and democracy\u201d and put an end to the\nperception that \u201cpoliticians, Whitehall-ites, public relations officers, local govern-\nment officials and Bloomsbury googies . . . are completely out of touch with real\npeople.\u201d39\nAlthough Documentary News Letter was primarily concerned with promoting\nrealism in film and the Griersonian style of representation, the view that the gov-\nernment had to use film to reconnect with its citizenry was confirmed by Mass-\nObservation.40 Comparing two early Ministry productions, Channel Incident (An-\nthony Asquith, 1940) and The Front Line (Harry Watt, 1940), Documentary News\nLetter urged filmmakers to present images that were \u201cboth truthful and decent\u201d\nand that allowed \u201cthe people [to] speak for themselves.\u201d Films had a duty to be\nabout \u201cus,\u201d they claimed, \u201cfrom the bowler-hatted Mayor standing on the prom-\nenade and saying \u2018Dover\u2019s all right\u2019 to the housewife with her story of the electric\nlight which turned itself on when a shell burst; from the nonchalant look-out man\ncounting the seconds between the Calais gun-flash and the ruination of a Dover\nchurch, to the Doric enthusiasm of the successful A.A. gun team,\u201d and not \u201cthem,\u201d\nthat \u201cmiserable section of the citizenry\u201d castigated by Priestley in his Sunday-night\nbroadcasts.41\nThe cinematic shift to depicting the ordinary relied on the creation of convincing\nportraits of the average man and woman at war, and accent and authentic dialogue\nwere key devices in this process. The Boulting brothers, Roy and John, fore-\ngrounded accent and dialogue in their 1940 film Dawn Guard, a touching story\nof a conversation between an old and a young man of the Home Guard, set in\nsouthwest England.42 Building upon their utopian visions, the protagonist\u2019s so-\nliloquy underlined the promise of the future. His accent, colloquial phraseology,\nand syntax carefully attempted to identify with the target audience and give a\nspecific, recognizable voice to the hopes for the postwar world:\n38 TNA: PRO RG 23\/44, Wartime Social Survey, DC 48532\/1, 1943.

The Griersonian style is the particular\nform of documentary associated with the filmmaker John Grierson. Grierson was adamant that the\ndocumentary should be as realistic as possible in its representation of the ordinary. For Grierson, film\nwas not so much about aesthetics as observation.

Failing to include the\n\u201cBritish\u201d in its vision of the people\u2019s war, it was poorly received in Scotland, the\nsolidly English focus and accented language obviating the broader task of forging\na credible image.43 Film had to respond, as Geoff Eley has observed, to \u201ca complex\nof democratic traditions stressing decency, liberalism, and the importance of ev-\neryone pulling together, in a way that honored the value and values of ordinary\nworking people.\u201d44\nIn this atmosphere and spirit the British public began to embrace, as Dilys Powell\nobserved, \u201cthemes which would once have been thought too serious or contro-\nversial for the ordinary spectator . . . [becoming] receptive to the imaginative\ninterpretation of everyday life.\u201d45 These interpretations needed a realistic medium\nto fulfill their aim of convincing the public that the war would promise a better\nfuture, that even during the war, as the Ministry of Information claimed in 1941,\n\u201cschisms and party distinctions have largely disappeared,\u201d and that \u201cclass distinc-\ntions . . . have also greatly declined.\u201d46 After all, the ministry believed that all\ndistinction in terms of locality, region, and class had been replaced by \u201ca new sense\nof purpose in life with a clear-cut objective in view\u2014winning the war,\u201d and it was\nfilm\u2019s task to reflect this idea of newfound unity.47 Films such as the Ministry of\nInformation short Ordinary People of 1941 (J. B. Holmes) began to give cinematic\nprominence to individuals \u201cwho secure no fame and who have no place in the\nheadlines.\u201d48 Filmmakers defined their contribution to the war effort as attempting\nto convince the British public that the central role in the war was reserved for\nordinary people.

The impact of a particular piece, at times,\nwas dependent upon whether the characters were believable to those they were\nattempting to represent, and accent played a central role in this process. The\nministry recognized not only that accents had to be real but also that it was essential\nthat films avoided patronizing \u201cthose whose patronage they [were seeking],\u201d for\nthe public \u201calways spots if it is being talked down to, and it is most suspicious of\nthe \u2018high fallutin\u2019.\u201d51 The ministry was keen to avoid \u201ctoo much lecturing\u201d and\nnoted that its \u201cpropaganda has so often borne the hallmark of aloofness and it is\nthat particular stigma that [it is] eager to remove.\u201d52 Mass-Observation confirmed\nin 1940 that the public reacted badly to films with \u201ca preachy tone,\u201d noting that\naudiences preferred realistic films as long as \u201cthey reflect the situation without the\nbias of intellectual better-off condescension about less educated people, a bias which\nhas reduced the mass potential of much documentary [production].\u201d53 This bias\nwas heightened by accent and, of course, by language. Documentary News Letter\nadvised the ministry that \u201cthe best way to carry on the work is to get in touch\nwith the people direct.\u201d54\nIn attempting to fulfill this function, filmmakers sought to foster national unity\nby presenting individuals and groups from different regional and class back-\ngrounds, \u201cthe typical British citizens themselves,\u201d in a sympathetic manner.55 In\nendeavoring to persuade the film industry to embrace the ordinary man or woman\nas the central character in shorts and features, Documentary News Letter com-\nmented that \u201cthe public is growing rapidly aware that the screen may entertain,\nnot only by providing relaxation and escape, but by presenting the wartime drama\nof the common people\u201d and that film could play a significant role in interpreting\n\u201cto the nation a new, bewildering, yet real, world at war.\u201d56 Documentary News\nLetter regretted that \u201cin the British film industry the belief still persists that it is\nhighbrowism or bolshevism to wonder if people who go to the cinema might not\n49 Harry Watt, quoted in \u201cGeorge Formby Wins the War,\u201d Times Higher Education Supplement, 20\nJuly 1973.

Filmgoers complained of \u201cthe frightfully Oxford accents\u201d\nthat permeated British film production, observing that this was, in itself, sufficient\nto destroy \u201cthe possibility of the audience associating themselves with the people\nin the film.\u201d58 This chimed in with clamors from the documentarists who called\nfor the recognition of the social function of film in wartime and beyond. Com-\nmenting on Workers and Jobs, a 1934 film depicting the daily routine of a labor\nexchange, they stressed how \u201cprofoundly moving\u201d the ordinary could be, the key\ningredient to the film\u2019s success being the fact that the \u201cdialogue was composed\nof conversations which pass every day across the counter . . . spoken by the actual\nmen for whom the routine of questioning or listening or just waiting had become\na part of everyday life.\u201d59 It was also in the filmmakers\u2019 financial interests to include\na wider variety of accents in their work, demonstrating \u201chow rarely the voice of\nthe people is heard in the cinema and [yet] how eloquent it can be.\u201d60 In the light\nof these observations, producers of short and feature films gradually began to\nincorporate some documentary techniques into fictional portraits on screen.\nFrom the advent of the sound picture, film producers made little \u201cattempt to\ncreate a specific cinematic form of enunciation,\u201d preferring instead to \u201cadopt the\nforms current in theatre and music hall.\u201d With the studios not recognizing the\nuniqueness of the cinema, \u201cthe wealth of West End theatrical talent was put forward\nas a component of Britain\u2019s potential for film production.\u201d61 By 1940, commen-\ntators began to notice that this was an inappropriate judgment. Documentary News\nLetter noted that \u201cit has long been the convention of the British stage and screen\nthat the more admirable human qualities can be associated only with the \u2018West-\nEnd\u2019 manner and accent. Middle-class, working-class and dialect-speaking char-\nacters are conventionally endowed with comic or criminal traits, or they are por-\ntrayed with the improbable eccentricity of the \u2018character\u2019 actor.\u201d62\nAs this suggests, a shift had to occur: cinema \u201cwould demand, if not different\nactors, then certainly different skills from those of the theatres.\u201d63 This was par-\nticularly true of dialogue. Film had already established its cultural codes and forms\nof address, which had become familiar to audiences. Consequently, filmmakers\nfaced considerable challenges in reconfiguring the language of the cinema to reflect\na broader social base. First, they faced a challenge in finding actors who could\ncarry off authentic portraits of working-class or regional characters.

If we are to\nmake such films on a wide scale the problem becomes a serious one.\u201d64 Filmmakers\ndiscovered that one solution to the problem of unconvincing performances was\nto cast \u201c\u2018real\u2019 people without previous acting experience.\u201d After all, they claimed,\nit was \u201ceasier to teach a glass-blower to act than to teach an actor to blow glass.\u201d65\nSuch an approach facilitated attempts to depict authenticity through a specific\ndialect, for contemporaries commented that accent was an essential component\nin fashioning a realistic feel to a film. However, producers found that \u201cthe con-\nditions of studio production, nerves, and camera consciousness [destroyed] the\nspontaneity of the ordinary person\u201d that they so wished to capture.66 This self-\nconsciousness revealed itself to the audience. One letter to Picture Goer in 1940\ncomplained that ministry shorts employing the ordinary person were \u201cboring,\u201d\nas \u201c\u2018the man in the street\u2019. . . however admirable as an individual, is a horribly\ninexperienced actor at any time and . . . falters, embarrassed, before the . . .\ncamera.\u201d67 Adverse reaction to realism was also confirmed by Roger Manvell, a\nfilm critic writing for Documentary News Letter in March 1943, who observed:\nAfter the slick and polished winner, the real people who play unpaid parts . . . look\ngarish and awkward, like persons who bat and shy before a press photographer at\nsome local function, or stare hollowly out of the pages of the illustrated society\nweeklies. . . . The pits and hollows of their unsmooth faces, accentuated by lighting\nand camera angle, were a new pictorial idiom. . . . And so these faces from the street\nand the factory, enlarged in close-up, smiling, self-conscious, real, were a shock to\nthe people themselves, and caused the same laughter as the curate gets when he\nappears in a farce at some parish theatricals.68\nThe audience\u2019s laughter revealed their discomfort at the unfamiliar sight of\neveryday people on screen, distracting from their acceptance of the message con-\nveyed by the film. This represented \u201ca new translation of what was too familiar\nin daily experience to . . . the screen so long devoted to the strange glamour of\nthe stars.\u201d Filmmakers, when attempting to recreate the ordinary, had to learn to\nwork within the \u201cpeculiar channels of screen idiom along which the public has\nlearnt to receive its emotional impulses.\u201d69 Producers also had to understand and\nwork around the tensions between, on the one hand, the audiences\u2019 desire to\nbroaden the social base of cinematic representation and, on the other, their dis-\ncomfort with the process of changing the forms of cinematic address. It was for\nthese reasons that the Home Publicity Sub-committee recommended that, al-\nthough they remained committed to representations of the ordinary on film, Min-\nistry of Information shorts needed to be produced in a studio with \u201cpopular artists\u201d\nin the leading roles, as the films would inevitably have \u201cgreater propaganda value.\u201d\n64 \u201cThe Man on the Screen,\u201d 3.\n65 Ibid.\n66 Ibid.\n67 M-O A: TC 17\/5\/A, letters to Picture Goer Weekly, 1940 report.

Directed by John Paddy Carstairs in 1940, All Hands,\nDangerous Comment, and Now You\u2019re Talking highlighted some of the difficulties\nproducers faced in attempting to connect with the average Briton and, in particular,\nthe working classes.71 The shorts were carefully scripted, shot in a studio, and used\nthe ministry\u2019s \u201cgilded pill\u201d tactic of casting well-known stars such as John Mills,\nall of which undermined the overall impact of the films.72 Ultimately, the films\nfailed to \u201cmove [their] audience[s] to a full appreciation of the dangers of gossip\nbecause the gossipers . . . never cease to be actors in the studio,\u201d Documentary\nNews Letter complained.73 The public found little identification with \u201cthe old\nfamiliar faces playing the old familiar parts.\u201d74 Len England, chief film reporter\nfor Mass-Observation, advised that \u201cit is essential with the Ministry propaganda\nshorts that a \u2018real\u2019 atmosphere should be produced and this is sacrificed if the\naudience regard themselves as watching John Mills and not any sailor.\u201d75 Where\nthe films appeared to be particularly wanting was in their failure to engage suf-\nficiently with realistic accent and dialogue, reaffirming the fictional aspect of the\nfilm and adding to the lack of identification of the audience with the on-screen\nevents. Mass-Observers in Donnington remarked on the Oxford or caricatured\naccents of the key characters, which, they stated, detracted from the overall impact\nof the film on the ordinary cinemagoer.76 Commenting on another careless talk\nfilm, Paul Rotha\u2019s You\u2019re Telling Me, produced in 1941, the audience noted that\n\u201cmen don\u2019t talk like that\u201d and that \u201cthe dialogue . . . is unreal,\u201d further lin-\nguistically distancing the viewer from the intended message of the piece.77\nThe films\u2019 failure to convince the public of their authenticity was compounded\nby a more serious outcome. The scenarios, accent, and characterization served\nto accentuate class difference, undermining the ministry\u2019s claim that class division\nhad been eradicated by the unity of a nation at war.78 Mass-Observation noted\n70 TNA: PRO INF 1\/251, \u201cFive minute shorts,\u201d Home Publicity Committee minutes, 13 November\n1940.

He noted that the most\nsuccessful ministry short in this respect had been Britain at Bay (Harry Watt,\n1940), which \u201cprovide[d] a bridge [between] middle and working classes.\u201d81\nSignificantly, the film was narrated by J. B. Priestley, further underpinning the\nBBC\u2019s belief that accent intensified the bond between presenter and audience.\nThe short film program provided by the ministry was not only considered un-\npopular by some cinema owners;82 it also led to the belief that the Films Division\nof the Ministry of Information was out of touch with the public, particularly with\nthose in the regions. As Mass-Observation noted in November 1940, \u201cThe Films\nDivision with its highly intelligent personnel, in its very high building, tends to\nbe easily out of touch with the rather simpler reactions of industrial Lancashire\nand rural Somerset,\u201d adding that it was obviously \u201cdifficult for any \u2018high-ups\u2019 to\nkeep in close or sympathetic touch with \u2018low-downs.\u2019\u201d83 Although the ministry\nand the film industry continued to make similar errors, they recognized that they\nneeded to find new ways of bringing an authentic image of the ordinary to the\nscreen that would contribute to their aspiration that cinema could both create\nand, to some extent, reflect the perception of a united nation at war.84 They\naccepted that they needed to craft an effective portrayal of class and region, cel-\nebrating difference and yet emphasizing unity. Their early experiments demon-\nstrated that in not offering authentic portraits, they were actually accentuating\ndifference rather than eliminating it.\nWhile short informational films failed to capture the popular imagination, feature\nfilms proved to be the staple entertainment for the masses at war.

In the earlier report on the \u2018careless talk\u2019 films, I emphasized strongly the point that the\nworking class were shown as the careless talkers, and the workers as spies.

Significantly, both\nWatt and Jennings injected the concept of the people\u2019s war into their productions,\nspecifically using dialogue, syntax, and accent to denote individual identity against\nthe backdrop of common purpose. Contemporary observers hailed Target for\nTonight as a \u201cmilestone in British film making . . . the real thing . . . actuality\u2014\ngrim, fascinating and engrossing with drama and chuckling humour both as spon-\ntaneous and real as the scenes inside Bomber Headquarters.\u201d85 By employing the\nmen of Bomber Command as the central protagonists, the film\u2019s producer, Ian\nDalrymple, recognized that \u201cin the pleasing projection of these fellows\u2019 person-\nalities lies 50% of our propaganda value.\u201d86 Watt deliberately inserted accented\ndialogue into the script to underpin the image of the collective: he recalled that\nhe had specifically requested the inclusion of a Canadian dialect, as \u201cafter all, it\nwas an Empire war,\u201d and a broad Scots accent to \u201cgive the impression of the\nmixture that was in the Services.\u201d87 Here, as in other productions of the same\ngenre and notably in Jennings\u2019s films, the various personalities and their \u201cexploits\nand experiences\u201d were located \u201cwithin the narrative of a general process,\u201d with\nits focus on \u201can operation requiring the interdependence of many people\u2014met-\naphorically at least, situating the individual within the national, exploring the place\nof the individual within the nation.\u201d88 Moreover, the scripted dialogue in Target\nfor Tonight highlighted marked contrasts between the language of the democracies\nand their authoritarian opponents. As historian David Welch has noted, the impact\nof the \u201cstilted dialogue\u201d of the Nazi \u201cdocumentaries of intimidation,\u201d such as\nFeuertaufe (Baptism of fire; Hans Bertram, 1940) and Sieg im Westen (Victory in\nthe west; Svend Noldan, 1941), was limited when compared to the human touch\nof British films such as Target for Tonight, \u201cwhere aviators, soldiers, and civilians\nspeak frankly about their feelings towards the war and the enemy.\u201d89 Such distin-\nguishing characteristics were also observed by Watt\u2019s contemporaries. Graham\nGreene commented that \u201ceverything is natural; there is none of the bombastic\nlanguage, the bragging and the threats that characterize the German film Baptism\nof Fire.\u201d90\nBy 1943, Watt\u2019s film contributed to Crown Film Unit\u2019s reputation for \u201cits genius\nin interpreting the services to the world without undue emotionalism, vain glory\nor false modesty.\u201d91 Fires Were Started was very much a part of the same tradition.\nLike Target for Tonight, the film employed dialect and authentic dialogue to un-\nderpin the notion of the people\u2019s war. Jennings, its director, in particular, was a\nstudent of national and regional distinctions, as demonstrated by his 1943 short\nfilm The Silent Village, in which the director celebrated localized Welsh customs\n85 Today\u2019s Cinema, 25 July 1941, 5.\n86 TNA: PRO INF 1\/210, Ian Dalrymple to Mr. Mercier, 15 May 1941.\n87 IWMS 5367\/11, interview with Harry Watt, October 1981, reel 4.\n88 Higson, Waving the Flag, 208.\n89 David Welch, Propaganda and the German Cinema, 1933\u201345 (London, 2001), 181\u201382.\n90 Graham Greene, quoted in K.

In Jennings\u2019s imaginary world in which a Welsh mining village, Cym-\ngiedd, is overrun by the soldiers of the Reich and suffers the same fate as the\nCzech town of Lidice, his protagonists use language to resist occupation. The\npress book for the production stressed the \u201cbeautiful character study of the school-\nmistress, when she makes her moving appeal to the children under her care not\nto forget their native tongue, even if their language is henceforth forbidden at\nschool.\u201d92 The striking contrast between the passionate, localized, and individual\ndialogue and the pervasive and conformist \u201cvoice of authority\u201d pumped through\nthe Nazi loudspeaker suggests the importance of the linguistic device to an un-\nderstanding of the function of the film. Reaffirming the sense of the ordinary,\nJennings chose to enlist the villagers of Cymgiedd as the \u201cstars\u201d of the film, its\ninhabitants living \u201cthe parts before the cameras just as they would had the events\ndepicted really happened to them.\u201d93 Given this particular mode of representation\nand the connection between expression, dialect, and the ordinary, it is unsurprising\nthat Jennings paid close attention to the diction of his characters in his depiction\nof the auxiliary fire service in Fires Were Started.\nAlthough Dalrymple, Jennings\u2019s producer, claimed that the director worked\nwithout a script, careful inspection of the treatments for Fires Were Started reveal\na detailed record of Jennings\u2019s intention for the use of specific dialogue and ac-\ncented language.94 The dialects of Jennings\u2019s subjects were clearly marked in the\ntext, from Johnny Daniels\u2019s cockney accent to \u201cB. A. Brown, Liverpool-Irish\u201d to\nthe \u201ctough little Scots fireman (name of Rumbold).\u201d95 Jennings illustrated the\npeople\u2019s war by depicting the firemen \u201ceach independent of the rest, though linked\nby reinforcement.\u201d96 A fusion of image and sound brought this vision to life on\nthe screen, reflecting Jennings\u2019s \u201celaborate interest in technical experiment in the\nrelationship between the visual and sound\u201d as characterized by his earlier works\nsuch as Listen to Britain (1942).97 In the fifth treatment of the film in January\n1942, the sample passages of dialogue use syntax and colloquialisms to indicate\nindividual characters\u2019 social background, adding to the grainy authenticity that\nJennings hoped to achieve:\nJacko.

Historian\nKevin Jackson has pointed out that throughout the film, \u201clines are thrown away\nor muted,\u201d and the nonprofessional actors can be distinguished by their \u201cslightly\nunnatural rhythms of speech and movement.\u201d101 Although he omitted the \u201cfoul\nlanguage which was in everybody\u2019s mouth at the time,\u201d Jennings captured the\nessence of the people\u2019s war and the ordinary man\u2019s role in it.102 The stilted and\nrough diction and speech patterns presented authentic characters with which the\naudience could identify. This was specifically a propagandistic construct. For, as\nDaniel Millar observed, \u201cthough the people in the film are virtually playing them-\nselves, neither is the characterization realistic. The personalities and their inter-\nactions are examined in detail; but the inevitable pettiness and squabbles in a small\ngroup of highly disparate people are not allowed to emerge,\u201d pointing to the\npseudoreality that finally surfaces from Jennings\u2019s cinematic text, more a \u201cblend\nof naturalism and classicism\u201d than an authentic portrait of the nation at war.103 In\nthis respect, Fires Were Started fitted neatly into the overall vision of unity promoted\nby the ministry in its wider persuasive campaigns.\nAlthough critics lauded Jennings\u2019s 1943 production, audiences found the film\nto be \u201cdeplorably slow\u201d in places, the tedium of the everyday life of the firemen\nproving to be unpopular.104 Once again, this pointed to the tension between\nprofessed desires to depict the ordinary and the deeper needs of the filmgoer. It\nwas increasingly apparent that cinematic styles had to be adapted to take such\npressures into consideration. In order to tap into public desires, films needed to\ncombine an element of the ordinary, notably by concentrating on individual char-\nacters, without making the subsequent representation overly dull. As the war pro-\ngressed, producers of fictional film came to recognize that \u201ceveryday life does not\nlack drama,\u201d and the cinema could just as easily reflect \u201cthe values and the ideals\nwhich make life worth living.\u201d105 Documentary News Letter had noted in May\n1940, \u201cOnly the documentary makers have so far looked habitually beyond the\nlay figures of screen romance for their characters. It now becomes the task of the\nfiction film producer to people his world, not with synthetic aristocrats, outrageous\neccentrics and the music-hall\u2019s conception of the proletariat, but with the inhab-\nitants of this country.\u201d106\nIn many ways, the feature film was the perfect vehicle for engaging popular\n99 Kevin Jackson, Humphrey Jennings (Basingstoke, 2004), 255.\n100 British press book for Fires Were Started.

It was, after all, the\npeople\u2019s medium, the projector of their fantasies as well as their conscience, and,\nas such, it had a far better chance of appealing to the masses than the short film:\nas Mass-Observation noted, producers of short films and documentaries were\nperceived to be \u201cin a world of their own,\u201d divorced from popular trends.107 Al-\nthough some filmmakers believed that feature and nonfiction films were entirely\ndistinct in their aim and purpose, documentary techniques were increasingly in-\ntegrated into mainstream fictional productions, fusing the real and the imaginary.108\nThree contemporary feature films thought to be the most poignant and effective\nrepresentations of the people\u2019s war\u2014Noel Coward\u2019s In Which We Serve (1943),\nFrank Launder and Sidney Gilliat\u2019s Millions Like Us (1943), and Carol Reed\u2019s The\nWay Ahead (1944)\u2014drew inspiration from the documentary form. Indeed, doc-\numentarist Paul Rotha claimed the initial idea for Millions Like Us as his own,\ncontending that his film Night Shift (Jack Chambers, 1942) formed the basis for\nLaunder and Gilliat\u2019s production.109 Moreover, as filmmaker Basil Wright recog-\nnized, features had begun to involve themselves in the social issues spearheaded\nby the documentary movement, notably by short films dealing with the postwar\nworld and plans for education, housing, and employment, such as Dawn Guard,\nPost 23 (Ralph Bond, 1941), and ABCA (Ronald Riley, 1943). Moreover, by\n1942, feature and documentary teams often shared personnel, Michael Balcon\nrecruiting distinguished documentarists such as Alberto Cavalcanti and Harry Watt\nto work at Ealing Studios.110\nMillions Like Us, like the documentaries, carved social identity through accented\nlanguage, for the experiences of its characters underline regional and class as well\nas gender distinctions. The press book proudly announced that, in her experience\nas a factory girl, Celia, the central female protagonist, meets \u201cevery type, rich and\npoor alike . . . Gwen, a Welsh girl whose wise-cracking remarks hide a kind heart;\nAnnie, who comes from Lancashire; and Jennifer, a rich society girl who finds her\nchanged life difficult.\u201d111 The film revealed a complex picture of the people\u2019s war\nthat was full of tensions and uncertainty, one in tune with the audiences\u2019 contem-\nporary understanding of national unity.112 On the one hand, coming from very\ndifferent backgrounds, the factory girls find companionship. On the other hand,\nsocial and regional difference drives a permanent wedge between Jennifer and the\nobject of her affections, Charlie, the factory foreman. Significantly, in the closing\nscene in which Charlie and Jennifer resolve to go their separate ways after the war,\nclass distinction is driven home through the use of accent:\n107 M-O A: \u201cHome Propaganda: A Report Prepared by Mass-Observation for the Advertising Service\nGuild,\u201d Bulletin of the Advertising Service Guild, no. 2 (1942): 31.\n108 Basil Wright, The Long View: A Personal Perspective on World Cinema (London, 1974), 109.\n109 Interview with Rotha in Elizabeth Sussex, The Rise and Fall of British Documentary (Berkeley,\n1975), 140\u201341.\n110 Aldgate and Richards, Britain Can Take It, 219.\n111 British press book for Millions Like Us (1943).

I\u2019m turning you down without even asking you. D\u2019you understand?\nJennifer. [Mocking his accent] Aye. Oh aye.\nThis sequence, in which social barriers could not be overcome, would have had\na particular resonance with contemporary audiences, reflecting the view that the\npeople\u2019s war had been exposed for \u201cthe sham that it always was.\u201d113 In this sense,\nMillions Like Us, in its tensions and contradictions, could be said to be the con-\ntemporary \u201cmirror of modern life as it may well be so known by many families\nthroughout the land.\u201d The Cinema contended that this was \u201cthe secret of the\npicture\u2019s certain appeal.\u201d114\nNevertheless, other films took a more optimistic view of the potential social\noutcomes of national unity in times of crisis. Like Millions Like Us, The Way Ahead\nhad been developed out of the documentary form as a fictional extension of an\narmy instruction film, The New Lot (Carol Reed, 1943). Reed\u2019s production created\nan image of a fighting force, its officers and men, drawn from all walks of life,\nfused by the common experience of the draft and battle. Reed\u2019s film, like Millions\nLike Us and In Which We Serve, did not deny class and regional tensions. Rather,\nit set them within the context of a redefined concept of the people\u2019s war, in which\ndivision was not denied but a collective goal allowed a temporal suspension of the\nprewar world, aptly demonstrated in the scene in which the conscripts meet for\nthe first time. Here, as in other productions of this genre, social status is indicated\nthrough accented language and class-specific dialogue and forms of address. This\nis seen in the exchange between the upper-middle-class Herbert Davenport (Ray-\nmond Huntley) and the working-class Ted Brewer (Stanley Holloway) that em-\nphasized individual identities:\nDavenport.

[Davenport raises an eyebrow disapprovingly]\nIn praising the film\u2019s characterization and authenticity, critics frequently made\nreference to the \u201cflick and flippancy of the dialogue,\u201d which added to the realism\nof the production, its characters presented without condescending \u201ccaricature,\naffectation or facetiousness.\u201d115 Indeed, critics recognized that the film reflected\nthe public\u2019s perception of themselves; C. A. Lejeune concluded that \u201cas an account\nof British speech and behaviour . . . [The Way Ahead] scarcely puts a foot\nwrong.\u201d116\nSuch realistic dialogue and speech patterns opened up a market for British feature\nfilms; British productions appealed to nations concerned about the prevalence of\nmodern American \u201cslang and accent\u201d distorting the English language and \u201chas-\ntening\u201d the process of \u201cAmericanisation.\u201d117 Moreover, as historian Mark Glancy\nhas suggested, \u201cHollywood\u2019s Britain was seldom an average or ordinary Britain.\u201d118\nFilms such as Waterloo Bridge (Mervyn LeRoy, 1940), Random Harvest (Mervyn\nLeRoy, 1942), and Mrs. Miniver (William Wyler, 1942) hardly reflected the \u201cgrey\ndrabness\u201d of the British city or the ordinary experience.119 Although Mrs. Miniver\nwas a popular success in both Britain and the United States, it also presented a\nskewed portrait of the British class system, despite its attempts to redress Holly-\nwood\u2019s vision of British society. Naturally, the documentarists responded most\nvehemently. Edgar Anstey, writing for The Spectator, went as far as to suggest that\nthe film was \u201cunconsciously pro-fascist propaganda\u201d in its suggestion that the\nmiddle class were \u201cthe backbone of Britain\u201d and denying the average Briton a\nrespected place in the people\u2019s war.120 As the Sunday Pictorial pointed out, \u201cMrs.\nMiniver\u2019s maid was \u2018a giggling half-wit\u2019, the maid\u2019s boyfriend \u2018an imbecile\u2019 and\nthe station master \u2018an amiable fool.\u2019\u201d Did \u201cthese ghastly caricatures honestly rep-\nresent the workers of Britain\u201d? Within the film, accent performed a dislocating\nfunction. For while Wyler elicited convincing accents from the majority of his cast,\nKay Miniver\u2019s husband, Clem (Walter Pidgeon), is distinctive in his use of the\nAmerican idiom.121 Nevertheless, the unrealistic aspects of Mrs. Miniver did not\ndetract from its popularity either in the United States or, significantly, in Britain.\nThis exposes a seemingly explicit tension between popular desires, patterns of\nconsumption, and critical acclaim, stressing the multiple needs of a population at\n115 The Times, 7 June 1944, 8.\n116 C.

Escapism, documentary, and realism could coexist, a point that is highlighted\nby a study of Coward\u2019s In Which We Serve.\nLike Millions Like Us and The Way Ahead, Coward\u2019s film, the most successful\nBritish film of 1943 and voted the eighth most popular film of the war years,\nfound contemporary popularity mainly because of the public\u2019s perception that he\nhad managed to create a realistic depiction of the ordinary set within the fictional\ntale of the HMS Torrin.122 Although the opening sequence saw Leslie Howard\nproclaim that \u201cthis film is about a ship,\u201d the real interest lay in the ship\u2019s occupants,\nand specifically in the film\u2019s central characters, Captain Kinross (Noel Coward),\nChief Petty Officer Hardy (Bernard Miles), Ordinary Seaman Blake (John Mills),\nand their families. In bringing these characters to life on the screen and denoting\ntheir social status, Coward relied partly on the set and costume but also on lan-\nguage, dialogue, and accent, and this played an important role in affirming the\naudiences\u2019 identification with the Kinrosses, Hardys, and Blakes, who represented\ntheir class and region but who were presented as individuals set within the whole.\nGiven that, in preparing for the film, Coward studied documentaries \u201cwith close\nattention,\u201d it is unsurprising to find a range of class and regional dialects within\nIn Which We Serve, especially as its central aim was to convince the public of the\nnecessity to set aside, but not to ignore, conventional British differences and to\nwork together for the war effort.123 As Mass-Observation noted, the public ap-\npreciated the fact that \u201cthe characters [in the film] were very true to life, each\nwas representative of a class type,\u201d recognizing that the film depicted \u201cpatterns\nof different classes united in common loyalty.\u201d124 In this way, In Which We Serve\nintended to reflect the stratification of society as understood by the British people.\nBernard Miles, who played Hardy in the film, recalled that \u201cthere were three decks\nin British society. There was a top deck and they\u2019d been through Eton and won-\nderful schools, and then there was a lower deck. Of course, they were all cockneys\nand they didn\u2019t know much . . . and then there was a middle deck and that was\nhow the film worked out.\u201d125 Miles detailed that the actors were fitted to the roles\nthe public associated them with in order to accurately represent each class: from\nCelia Johnson as the upper-class wife of Kinross to John Mills as Shorty Blake,\n\u201cevery inch the true blue, wise cracking cockney,\u201d each \u201cfitting the three decker\nsociety of which [they] were products.\u201d126\nMiles confirmed that Coward \u201cwas wonderful at . . . understanding the class\nsystem.\u201d127 As Aldgate and Richards point out, although In Which We Serve en-\ndorsed preexisting social structures, in contemporary terms this did not \u201cinvalidate\nthe emotional truth of the film,\u201d especially as the concepts that underpinned it,\nas well as wider governmental propaganda, were concerned with establishing a\n122 Aldgate and Richards, Britain Can Take It, 206.\n123 Wright, The Long View, 109.\n124 M-O A: 1943, directive replies on favorite films, in Sheridan and Richards, Mass-Observation at\nthe Movies.

This point must not be misunderstood, because Coward is one of the first\npeople to put across with truth and realism the character and behaviour of the\nthree different income groups.\u201d129 This was ultimately the key reason behind the\nfilm\u2019s success.\nNowhere are these distinctions more apparent than in the Christmas scene, and\nnotably in the toasts to the HMS Torrin over lunch, where the three tiers of\nCoward\u2019s society are juxtaposed. Their dialogue, syntax, and accent further stressed\nindividual and distinct class identities. The sequence begins in the working-class\nhome of \u201cShorty Blake.\u201d The linguistic form denotes the social status of the family,\nphrases such as \u201cthem kids,\u201d \u201cit don\u2019t do no such thing,\u201d and \u201cwe was in the\nRed Sea\u201d reaffirming delineated identities. In the middle-class home of Petty-\nOfficer Hardy, class identity is also reaffirmed through language or, more specif-\nically, the challenge to language:\nHardy. [Having leave at Christmas] is little short of a bloody miracle.\nKath. Walter! How can you? You know I don\u2019t like you using that word!\nHardy. Be that as it may, that\u2019s a mighty expressive word. What\u2019s more it\u2019s been\nbound up with naval tradition since times immemorial.\nGuest. I have heard it whispered in the R.A.F.\nThe sequence concludes in the home of Captain Kinross, where his wife makes\nan eloquent and heavily accented toast to her \u201cpermanent and undefeated rival,\u201d\nthe HMS Torrin, commenting that \u201cit is extraordinary that anyone could be so\nfond and so proud of their most implacable enemy, this ship\u201d and adding, rather\nregally, \u201cGod bless her and all who sail in her.\u201d Despite the suggested class dif-\nferences, the celebration of the ship and observance of national traditions sur-\nrounding the holiday unite all the characters. However, each man appears within\nhis own familial and class contexts.\nAudiences of 1942 could easily identify with this approach. As an accounts clerk\nfrom the Royal Air Force at Orkney said, \u201cIt was obviously a film of things as\nthey are, and not just a string of hashed up ideas from the back-room boys of the\nfilm world with false heroics and sentiment.\u201d A civil servant from Morecombe\nadded that there was \u201cpathos, tragedy, strong emotion in it, but no exaggerated\nsentiment and no glamorous film stars stepping out of its story to show off their\n\u2018charms.\u2019\u201d130 This confirmed Kinematograph Weekly\u2019s view that the film did not\nneed to resort to \u201cblondes or other synthetic subterfuges\u201d to be a popular suc-\ncess.131 The audience could identify with the characters\u2019 \u201cheroism in times of special\n128 Quotation from Aldgate and Richards, Britain Can Take It, 208.\n129 Documentary News Letter, October 1942, 143\u201344.

As associate producer Anthony\nHavelock Allen recalled of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger\u2019s 1946 pro-\nduction A Matter of Life and Death, many films focused on the officer class:\n\u201cNobody in heaven talked with cockney accents, all the angels were clearly upper-\nclass.\u201d134 The fact that In Which We Serve broke from that mold featured heavily\nin the film\u2019s promotional literature. The press book, distributed to journalists and\ncinema owners, stressed that the film had captured \u201cthe mood and manners of\nthe English people in their everyday lives . . . with no suspicion of caricature or\nexaggeration.\u201d Drawing attention to the mannerisms and accents of the protag-\nonists, it commented that \u201cthe distinction between the smoother, and perhaps\nmore superficial, behavior of the upper-class officers and their wives, and the less\nmannered talk and actions of the ordinary seamen is brought out clearly, but\nwithout distortion.\u201d Special attention was given to Miles\u2019s southwest accent, with\nthe press book urging the press and cinema owners to remind the audience of\n\u201chis . . . rustic monologues,\u201d emphasizing that Miles had long been \u201ca keen\nstudent of English dialects.\u201d135 Noncaricatured accents added to the film\u2019s realistic\nfeel. The film\u2019s producers and actors knew that in order for the story of the HMS\nTorrin to be convincing, characters and their mannerisms had to be accurate. In\nthis respect, In Which We Serve proved to be a considerable success. The perfor-\nmances of the principal actors, in particular Miles and Mills, were thought to be\nso realistic that The Times warned that they were \u201cin danger of getting themselves\ntaken for granted,\u201d blending seamlessly into the sense of the ordinary cultivated\nby the producers.136 Miles emphasized that the film crew recognized that \u201cthe\nBritish people were aware of these things\u201d and that the cameramen were inspired\nby the Griersonian style of documentary, as evidenced by the opening sequence\nof the film that focuses on the shipyard.137 The producers went to considerable\nlengths to make the film look and sound authentic, drawing on the expertise of\nthe documentarists.138 They also brought in navy men on \u201csurvivors\u2019 leave\u201d to fill\nthe parts of extras.139\nHaving \u201creal men\u201d on the set also helped Coward perfect the dialogue and\nspeech patterns in the film.

At times, realistic depictions required some\n\u201ccommon language\u201d or swearing: Miles used the word \u201cbloody,\u201d and at another\npoint in the film the line \u201chere come the bastards back again\u201d is used. In 1940,\nKinematograph Weekly encouraged the use of common language, impressing upon\nfilmmakers that \u201cthe message to be delivered must be direct and not obscured by\n\u2018arty\u2019 fussiness. . . . Symbolism may make its appeal to the few cultured minds\nbut propaganda, to have its widest and strongest appeal, must speak what a former\ngeneration called \u2018the vulgar tongue.\u2019\u201d141 In this way, realism, accent, and language\nbecame synonymous.\nAlthough the film\u2019s use of swearing undoubtedly added to the realistic feel of\nthe film, this decision created some problems with both home and foreign au-\ndiences, even leading to comment in the House of Commons.142 For some con-\ntemporary observers, such as Manvell, the language used by the sailors in the film\nwas not realistic enough, although he admitted that such realism caused uncom-\nfortable reactions among the audience at times:\nThe language used by the men on the raft whilst the Jerries of In Which We Serve\nshoot them up is mild compared with what a voluble man would use in the actual\ncircumstances. Yet an unsophisticated audience knowing full well the peril and stress\nof the situation will laugh at words like \u201cbastard\u201d and \u201cbloody.\u201d Why? Because they\ncome from an artificial medium, a screen, a speaker, and they are magnified, are heard\nin a packed hall. Such words heard by anyone with two ears alert, in any place where\npeople congregate, are none the less secret words, taboo words for half-private use\nonly. . . . Result, laughter due to mild shock. . . . Swearing is a continuous mild\njoke. . . . It is irritating to hear the laughter, but it is ten to one that the average\nprovincial British audience will produce it.143\nIt became apparent, then, that the film\u2019s greatest achievement in providing con-\nvincing characters and dialogue also proved to be its greatest problem and attests\nto the sensitivity of language within film.\nAccent and realistic dialogue added to the authenticity of a film at a time when\naudiences wanted to find figures on the screen with which they could identify,\nnotably from the outbreak of war until 1942. In short, the media during the war\n\u201copened up to people\u2019s voices.\u201d144 This was integral to the accommodation of the\neveryday within British wartime cinema.

At best, films merely\nreinforced existing class distinctions while stressing the need for unity rather than\n\u201csameness,\u201d corroborating Sonya Rose\u2019s conclusion that portraits of Britain at war\n\u201ccelebrated diversity, implicitly advocated tolerance and recognized Britain as a\nclass- and gender-divided society but denied that it mattered to national unity\u2014\nto the image of the British as essentially one people.\u201d145 At worst, as in the case\nof the Ministry of Information\u2019s \u201ccareless talk\u201d shorts, class division was accen-\ntuated rather than subordinated. As historian John Blaxendale has contended, \u201cany\nattempt to define\u201d class, regional, and even national collective identity \u201csimply\nrevealed the depth of historical class divisions and the difficulty of communicating\nacross them.\u201d He concluded that \u201cin the end, the \u2018we\u2019 who vainly resolved to\nhang out the washing on the Siegfried Line were simply, as Priestley optimistically\nput it, \u2018you and I\u2014all of us ordinary people.\u2019\u201d146 In short, as Rose observed, \u201cthe\npull to unity was haunted by the specter of division and difference.\u201d147 War did\nnot \u201cerode all those prejudices deriving from differences of class, gender and\nethnicity.\u201d148 Equally, film did not and could not reflect \u201cwhat people were actually\ndoing, saying and feeling,\u201d preferring instead to create an imagined popular opin-\nion within which the people\u2019s war was little more than a cultural construct, albeit\na powerful one.149 It follows that images of the people\u2019s war should not be read\nas realistic depictions of the national spirit. After all, \u201ccinema, radio, war artists,\nPathe News and Picture Post were not passive recording angels but active agents\nfor promoting a certain frame of citizen mind.\u201d150 To be successful in this task,\nthe portrait of the people\u2019s war had to reinforce existing social values and fractures\nrather than seek to revolutionize them.\nHowever, for all the realism presented in films relating to the people\u2019s war, the\npopularity of the Hollywood escapist film and the Gainsborough melodramas\nseemingly created a tension between images of \u201cus ordinary people\u201d and the desire\nto escape the mundane.151 Did the average factory girl want to be more like Gwen\nPrice, Annie Earnshaw, and Jennifer Knowles of Launder and Gilliat\u2019s film Millions\nLike Us or did they want to be like the Hollywood stars of the silver screen? After\nall, Mass-Observation reported in 1940 that \u201cJoan Crawford was the fourth most\nimportant factor in determining the headwear of Cockney and Lancashire girls.\u201d152\nGlamour was increasingly popular throughout the war years, and it was the glamour\nof Hollywood that appealed to British audiences. As one cinemagoer recalled, \u201cI\npreferred Hollywood stars in the forties. It had mostly to do with glamour.

By the end of 1942, as\nthe toll of war increased the demand for more escapist cinema, it was no longer\nenough for the Ministry of Information to assume that identification only took\nplace where audiences were confronted with themselves. A more powerful iden-\ntification could be felt when the ordinary was placed within the extraordinary, for\ninstance, the popularity of the Gainsborough melodrama, which drew high box\noffice figures throughout 1943 and beyond, affirming the cinema\u2019s place as a\n\u201cdream palace.\u201d Mass-Observation noted that \u201cit seems reasonable to believe that\nthe reason for [the popularity of Cinderella stories] is that in the opening sequences\nthe audience can identify itself with the hero or heroine, and follow them more\neasily in the imagination in their subsequent adventures.\u201d156 It is unsurprising,\ntherefore, to find that, in the early 1940s, audiences turned to the Hollywood\n\u201cdream factory\u201d or to the British Gainsborough melodramas to escape the mo-\nnotony of the everyday.\nTo what extent is the distinction between realism and escapism a false dichotomy?\nDespite all the publicity surrounding the authenticity of In Which We Serve, Cow-\nard viewed the film rather differently, resisting categorization by the film press.\nCommenting that modern entertainment should not be seen as either escapist or\nrealist, as such divisions were \u201cfoolish,\u201d he noted that he considered \u201call enter-\ntainments in essence escapism because they practically always are concerned with\nsomething people don\u2019t themselves do in their everyday lives.\u201d \u201cIn Which We\nServe,\u201d he continued, \u201cwas just as escapist in its way as Blithe Spirit.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d he\ninformed C.

Distinct pro-\nductions, such as the fictional and documentary genres, could coexist within the\nwartime film program, providing for fluctuating and individual needs of the pop-\nulation at war. Moreover, films could simultaneously be read as escapist and realist\nand could respond to fantasies even in the depiction of the real, drawing on the\nmultifaceted popular interpretations of the people\u2019s war and, significantly, its re-\nlationship to the postwar world. Moreover, accent and language played a funda-\nmental role in this process of both representing the \u201cordinary\u201d and the \u201cextraor-\ndinary.\u201d For not only could it affirm the identity of the familiar; it could also\nintroduce the unfamiliar, whether regional or international, through dialect.\nIn addition, confronting the meaning of national unity in relation to the \u201cnew\nJerusalem\u201d was, in many senses, engaging with \u201cordinariness\u201d whilst exploring a\nfantasy that countered the memory of the Depression and the social inequalities\nof the 1930s. For all the conceptual problems that the \u201cpeople\u2019s war\u201d raised within\ncontemporary British society, in which division was recognized and embedded,\nthe ideal of national unity became a prominent aspect of the hopes for a postwar\nconsensus and featured heavily in the cinematic discourse, functioning as a means\nnot only of reinvigorating the nation in its final push for victory but also of\nreinventing Britain as the \u201cLand of Promise\u201d in the popular imagination. At this\nlevel, the concept of the people\u2019s war became a hugely powerful force. In rep-\nresenting acceptable visions of the collective, within which individual and multiple\nidentities were allowed to operate, film not only offered an eloquent and persuasive\nargument for wartime unity but also tapped into the popular desire for a new\npostwar social structure that built upon the war experience. By doing so, the cinema\nprovided \u201ca screen for contemporary anxieties and dilemmas, where particular\nrepresentations and representational repertoires are also specifically produced and\nshaped.\u201d158 In every sense, wartime cinema provided a space in which the com-\nplexities of defining identities could be worked out, in which fantasy and the\n\u201cordinary\u201d combined to allow the everyman to become a hero, paving the way\nfor the distinctive master narratives that dominated the British cinema of the\npostwar world.\n157 Noel Coward, interviewed by C.
