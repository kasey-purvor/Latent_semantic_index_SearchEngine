Direct measurements are difficult and\n1\nnot yet conclusive, owing to the large uncertainties caused by the bright foreground emission associ-\nated with zodiacal light1. An alternative approach2\u20135 is to study the absorption features imprinted\non the \u03b3-ray spectra of distant extragalactic objects by interactions of those photons with the back-\nground light photons6. Here we report the discovery of \u03b3-ray emission from the blazars7 H 2356\u2212309\nand 1ES 1101\u2212232, at redshifts z=0.165 and z=0.186, respectively. Their unexpectedly hard spectra\nprovide an upper limit on the background light at optical\/near-infrared wavelengths that appears to\nbe very close to the lower limit given by the integrated light of resolved galaxies8. The background\nflux at these wavelengths accordingly seems to be strongly dominated by the direct starlight from\ngalaxies, thus excluding a large contribution from other sources \u2013 in particular from the first stars\nformed9. This result also indicates that intergalactic space is more transparent to \u03b3-rays than previ-\nously thought.\nThe observations were carried out with the High Energy Stereoscopic System10 (H.E.S.S. ), a system\nof four imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes operating at energies E \u2265 0.1 TeV. These two blazars\nare at present the most distant sources for which spectra have been measured at these energies (Tab. 1).\nIntergalactic absorption is caused by the process of photon-photon collision and pair production. The\noriginal spectrum emitted by the source (which we call \u201cintrinsic\u201d) is modified such that the observed flux\nFobs(E) = Fint(E) \u00b7 e\n\u2212\u03c4(E)\n, where the optical depth \u03c4(E) depends on the Spectral Energy Distribution\n(SED) of the Extragalactic Background Light (EBL) (Fig. 1). Details are provided in the Supplementary\nNotes and Figures. For any reasonable range of fluxes at ultraviolet (UV) and optical\/near-infrared wave-\nlengths (O\u2013NIR), \u03c4(E) \u2013 and thus absorption \u2013 is larger at 1 TeV with respect to 0.2 TeV. This difference\nmakes the observed spectrum steeper (that is, \u0393obs > \u0393int, for a power-law model dN\/dE \u221d E\u2212\u0393) The\nspectral change \u2206\u0393=\u0393obs\u2212\u0393int scales linearly with the EBL normalization, and becomes more pronounced\nat larger redshifts. Thus more distant objects provide a more sensitive diagnostic tool.\nIn general, if the intrinsic spectrum were sufficiently well known, \u03c4(E) \u2013 and thus the EBL SED \u2013\ncould be effectively measured by comparing intrinsic with observed spectra. Blazars, however, are char-\nacterized by a wide range of possible spectra, and the present understanding of their radiation processes is\nnot yet complete enough to reliably predict their intrinsic \u03b3-ray spectra. But for these two sources, with\nO\u2013NIR fluxes at the level of the \u201cdirect\u201d estimates, the intrinsic spectra needed to reproduce the H.E.S.S.\ndata become extremely hard (that is, they have small values of \u0393), at odds with the currently known blazar\nphysics and phenomenology. This can be avoided by reducing the energy dependence of the optical depth,\nassuming either very low O\u2013NIR fluxes (reducing \u03c4 at 1 TeV) or very high UV\u2013O fluxes (increasing \u03c4 at\n0.2 TeV). The latter case, however, would require unreasonably high UV fluxes (as discussed later). We can\nthen derive an upper limit on the EBL by requiring the intrinsic spectrum to be compatible with the present\nknowledge of blazars.\nTo determine such a limit, a plausible shape for the EBL SED is assumed. As a reference shape in\nthe 0.1-10 \u00b5m range we adopted the phenomenological curve used in refs6, 11, which is designed to be in\ngeneral agreement with the EBL spectrum expected from galaxy emission12, 13. This curve, labelled P1.0 in\nFigs 1 and 2, was originally normalized to match the \u201cdirect\u201d estimates at 2.2 and 3.5\u00b5m (refs1, 14, 15). Here\nwe leave its normalization as a free parameter, scaling P1.0 by different factors P (labelled accordingly, the\ncurve scaled by 0.45\u00d7 is \u201cP0.45\u201d) down to the lower limit obtained by the resolved galaxy counts8 (\u223cP0.4).\nTo reproduce the excess around 1.5 \u00b5m claimed from the Infrared Telescope in Space (IRTS) data16 (also\nargued by ref17), an additional ad hoc component was considered, labelled \u201cENIR\u201d. This feature is not\nexpected from standard galaxy evolution models, and could be the spectral signature of radiation produced\n2\nin the early universe, for example by the first stars formed (metal-free massive stars, called \u2018Population III\u2019;\nsee e.g. refs9, 18).\nThe intrinsic source spectra (Fig. 2) have been reconstructed directly from the observed ones using\nthe assumed EBL, without a priori assumptions on the blazar spectrum. EBL evolution effects (e.g. due to\ngalaxy evolution) were not included: these effects, negligible at low redshifts, become important as redshift\nincreases, but for the range considered here (z = 0.165 \u2212 0.186) their impact is still limited to a factor of\n. 10% (\u2206P < 0.1; see Supplementary Information). The reconstructed spectra are generally compatible\nwith a power-law (dN\/dE \u221d E\u2212\u0393), but the EBL densities P1.0+ENIR and P1.0 both yield extremely hard\nphoton indices (\u0393int < 0, see Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. SI-2), implying a pile-up or line-like feature\nin the blazars\u2019 SED around 1\u20133 TeV. We obtain the same result by considering the NIR excess added to the\ngalaxy counts limits (e.g. P0.4+ENIR, see Supplementary Fig. SI-3). This is because a lower EBL flux only\nin the UV\u2013O band decreases the absolute values of \u03c4 but increases the contrast between 0.2 and 1 TeV.\nSuch hard spectra have never been seen in the closest, less absorbed TeV blazars such as Mkn 421 and\nMkn 50119\u201321 (z \u223c 0.03, \u0393int \u2248 1.5 \u2212 2.8 using the same EBL SEDs), and are difficult to explain within\nthe present standard leptonic or hadronic scenarios6 for blazar emission. In shock acceleration models,\nthe hardest index obtained for the accelerated particles is s = 1.5 (see e.g. ref22). In the case of protons\ninteracting with ambient plasma, the resulting \u03b3-ray spectrum has the same slope, \u0393int = 1.5. In the\ncase of electrons, the spectrum of the \u03b3-rays emitted through inverse Compton scattering is expected to\nbe steeper than \u0393int = 1.5 under most circumstances. Only if radiative cooling is not effective and the\nblazar Compton emission is wholly within the Thomson limit \u2013 unlikely at such high energies \u2013 one finds\n\u0393int = (s+1)\/2 = 1.25. We thus assume in the following discussion that the true average intrinsic spectrum\nwas not harder than \u0393int = 1.5, although later we also address the possibility of harder spectra.\nTo be compatible with \u0393int \u2265 1.5, the EBL flux has to be scaled down to P0.45 to explain both\nobjects\u2019 data, with 1ES 1101\u2212232 providing the most stringent constraints thanks to the better statistics at\nhigh energies and the larger redshift. With a fixed EBL shape, there is a direct link between the normalization\nP and \u0393int. The one-sigma statistical and systematic uncertainties on the H.E.S.S. spectral measurement can\nthen be translated to an equivalent uncertainty on P, \u2206P \u2243 \u00b10.15 (see Supplementary Information).\nThis limit (P0.45) is robust with respect to a different EBL spectral shape, as long as it maintains an\noverall maximum around 1\u20132 \u00b5m. Below 1\u00b5m, lower fluxes than our template tend to harden the intrinsic\nspectrum more, while even a flat slope from 1.4\u00b5m down to 0.1\u00b5m would soften it by only \u2206\u0393 \u223c0.1.\nAbove 2\u00b5m, the slope cannot be much flatter than our template \u2013 a flatter slope could explain in part the\n\u201cdirect\u201d measurements at 3.5\u00b5m (Supplementary Fig. SI-4) \u2013 because this would again imply a new, very\nhard component (\u0393int < 0) in the intrinsic spectrum, rising at a few TeV (Supplementary Fig. SI-5). In this\nrespect, this H.E.S.S. dataset gives the same indication as the HEGRA data11 on H 1426+428 (z=0.129),\nwhich show a flattening feature above 1 TeV naturally provided by a starlight EBL between 3 and 10 \u00b5m\n(SED \u221d \u03bb\u22121).\nTherefore, the conservative and self-consistent assumptions of both not unusual blazar spectra (\u0393int \u2265\n1.5) and a galaxy-like EBL spectrum allow the EBL flux around 1\u20132\u00b5m to be constrained at the level of\n. (14 \u00b1 4) nW m\u22122 sr\u22121(that is, \u2264 0.55 \u00b1 0.15 \u00d7P1.0). This corresponds to P(0.45+0.1) to allow for\ngalaxy evolution effects. Coupled with the lower limits derived from galaxy counts given by the Hubble\nSpace Telescope8 (\u223c9.0\u20139.7+3.0\n\u22121.9 nW m\u22122 sr\u22121), the H.E.S.S. spectra lead to conclude that more than 2\/3\nof the EBL in the O\u2013NIR band is resolved into single sources. This result is completely independent of\nany \u201cdirect\u201d measurement of the EBL. Remarkably, it is in severe conflict with the claims of high EBL flux\n3\nat NIR wavelengths16, 17 and, to a lesser extent, with the reported detections at 2.2 and 3.5\u00b5m1, 15. The\nH.E.S.S. upper limits agree instead with the most recent theoretical calculations23 of the EBL, as well as\nwith recent theoretical arguments24, 25 against high EBL fluxes due to Pop III stars.\nThis result is also rather insensitive to small changes in the assumed intrinsic slope. A different value,\nif proved more likely by future results, will shift the limit accordingly, but only strong spectral differences\nwould qualitatively change our conclusion: even a value of \u0393int = 1.0 would loosen the 0.55\u00d7 limit only to\n\u2264 0.7\u00d7P1.0.\nAlternative scenarios which could reconcile the measured spectra with high O\u2013NIR fluxes formally\nexist, and would represent a major discovery in their own right, but we consider them very unlikely, given\ntheir exotic implications. Higher UV fluxes would make the intrinsic spectra softer, but the huge values\nrequired (> 300 nW m\u22122 sr\u22121, see Fig. 1, for example) are not supported by other measurements1, 26, and\ncould not be accomodated within any reasonable cosmological model.\nA more viable alternative is that such hard spectra are a real, new feature of the TeV blazar emission.\nPossible mechanisms have already been envisaged6 . For example, the inverse Compton scattering of mono-\nenergetic electrons (E0, such as cold plasma with very large bulk motion Lorentz factor), interacting in deep\nKlein-Nishina regime with a narrow-band photon field (such as a Planck-type distribution) may lead to very\nflat \u03b3-ray spectra with a sharp pile-up at \u01eb\u03b3 \u223c E0, reproducing spectra like the ones in Fig. 2. However, such\nfeatures should become directly visible in the observed spectra of the closer, less absorbed objects of the\nsame type, like the well-studied Mkn 421 and Mkn 501 (if \u0393int was\u2248 0, they should show \u0393obs . 0.5). This\nis in contrast with observations19\u201321, unless we assume a dependence of the source parameters on redshift\nsuch that the corresponding features always disappear due to EBL absorption. It is difficult to justify such a\nfine-tuning on a relatively small redshift range, although more objects and observations are needed to settle\nthis issue definitively, given the still-limited sample.\nOther possibilities include the non-cosmological origin of blazars\u2019 redshifts and the violation of\nLorentz invariance (see e.g. ref27). However, both scenarios imply dramatic revisions of modern physics\nand astrophysics, which we do not consider to be justified by these data alone.\nA low EBL level, in agreement with the expectations from standard galaxy evolution models, is the\nsimplest and most likely explanation of the H.E.S.S. data.\n1.

The systematic uncertainty on the flux and photon index are estimated\nto be \u223c15% and \u223c0.1, respectively. Details of these observations will be published elsewhere;\nhere we have focused on the cosmological implications of the measured spectra. Compared to\nthe previous observations of TeV blazars, these H.E.S.S. spectra provide significantly stronger\nconstraints on the EBL because of the combination of a hard spectrum and relatively high redshift\n(see Supplementary Information).\n6\nFigure 1 Spectral Energy Distribution of the EBL in the wavelength band most affecting these\nH.E.S.S. data (0.1\u201310 \u00b5m). The EBL data are from a review compilation1 (errors 1\u03c3), unless other-\nwise stated. Open symbols correspond to the integrated light from galaxy counts, and thus must\nbe considered lower limits for the EBL: in the UV\u2013O range, from Hubble data (green, red8); in\nthe NIR, from Spitzer (blue28) and ISO data. Note that these data are also lower limits for the\ntotal emission from galaxies, because of various observational and selection effects in the detec-\ntion and counting of faint galaxies. The possible missed light in the the UV\u2013O band has been\nestimated29 to be . (2\u20133) nW m\u22122 sr\u22121. The upper limits (purple) are 2\u03c3 estimates1. Direct mea-\nsurements are shown as filled symbols: IRTS data from the NIR Spectrometer16 (blue), and data\nfrom COBE\/DIRBE (green15, magenta17 and red triangles). Red squares correspond to tentative\ndetections in the optical26 with corrections according to ref30. The curves show the EBL shapes\nused to reconstruct the intrinsic spectra. P1.0 gives 26, 23 and 14 nW m\u22122 sr\u22121at 1.25, 2.2 and\n3.5 \u00b5m, respectively. The thick line shows the range most effectively constrained by the H.E.S.S.\ndata. In the long-dashed regions, higher fluxes than P0.55 would not be in conflict, as long as the\nflux in the 1-3\u00b5m range is within or around the limit. The short dashed line shows the additional\nUV component needed by P1.0 to soften the intrinsic spectrum down to \u0393 = 1.5 (see Supplemen-\ntary Fig. SI-5; ENIR would require even higher fluxes). This example is the most energetically\neconomic solution, limited to the narrow range \u223c 0.2 \u2212 0.4\u00b5m to have the maximum effect on the\n\u03b3-ray spectrum with the minimum UV flux and the minimum impact on the overall attenuation.\n7\nFigure 2 The H.E.S.S. spectra of 1ES 1101\u2212232, corrected for absorption with three different\nEBL SEDs, as labelled in Fig. 1. Red: observed data. Blue: absorption-corrected data. The\ndata points are at the average photon energy in each bin, also used to calculate the optical\ndepth for reconstruction. For the calculation, a flat \u039b-dominated cosmology was adopted, with\nH0 = 70 km\/s\/Mpc, \u2126m = 0.3, \u2126\u039b = 0.7. Error bars are 1\u03c3, statistical errors only. Between\n1.3 and 3.3 TeV, the overall detection is 4\u03c3. The lines show the best-fit power laws to the recon-\nstructed spectrum (dN\/dE = N0(E\/TeV)\u2212\u0393int), and the corresponding shapes after absorption.\nThe \u03c72red\/d.o.f. (calculated by integrating the absorbed power-law model over each observed data\nbin) are (from left to right): 1.20\/11, 0.54\/11, 0.47\/11. We note that possible spectral variability\ndoes not weaken our conclusions because it would imply states with even harder spectra than the\naverage one (by definition). Note also that the X-ray spectrum (which in blazars usually samples\nthe synchrotron emission of TeV electrons) measured during simultaneous observations in June\n2004 and March 2005 does not show such hard slopes, but is similar to the historical values (Aha-\nronian et al. 2006, in preparation). For H 2356\u2212309, the same EBL SEDs yield \u0393int = \u22120.6, 0.7\nand 2.0, respectively (Suppl. Fig. SI-2). The NIR excess onto the galaxy counts limits (P0.4+ENIR)\nyields \u0393int \u2248 \u22120.7 and \u22120.4 for the two objects, respectively (see Suppl. Fig. SI-3).\n8\nSupplementary Information\nIn this paper we have derived an upper limit on the Extragalactic Background Light (EBL) in the optical to\nnear infrared band (O\u2013NIR). This is done by examining the effect of absorption, caused by interaction with\nEBL in this band, on the \u03b3-ray spectra of two newly-detected distant blazars: 1ES 1101\u2212232 (z=0.186) and\nH 2356\u2212309 (z=0.165). Here we provide additional details on the manner in which EBL absorption modifies\nthe source spectrum, and on the impact on the derived limit of the uncertainties in the \u03b3-ray measurements\nand of galaxy evolution effects. We also explain why previous TeV blazar detections did not provide a\ncomparably strong limit, and present supplementary figures to better illustrate the cases described in the\npaper. At the end, we provide a table with the H.E.S.S. spectral data for the two sources.\n1 Supplementary Notes\nEBL absorption\nAbsorption modifies the intrinsic source spectrum according to Fobs(E) = Fint(E) \u00b7 e\u2212\u03c4(E). The optical\ndepth \u03c4(E) is obtained by convolving the EBL photon density distribution n(\u01eb) with the pair production\ncross-section \u03c3(E, \u01eb), and integrating over the \u03b3-ray photon path from the source to the observer:\n\u03c4(E) =\n\u222b z\n0\ndl(z)\n\u222b\n\u221e\n\u01ebthr\nn(\u01eb)\u03c3(E, \u01eb)d\u01eb, (1)\n(where dl(z) = cdt(z) is the proper line element, \u03c3(E, \u01eb) is already integrated over angles for an isotropic\nfield of background photons, and the photon density and energies depend on redshift). The energy depen-\ndence of \u03c4(E) strongly depends on the spectrum of the background photons (see e.g. ref[19]). For example,\nif n(\u03b5) \u221d \u03b5\u22121 (or equivalently the EBL SED \u03bdI\u03bd \u221d \u03bb\u22121), the optical depth appears constant with energy,\nwhile for n(\u03b5) \u221d \u03b5\u22122 (i.e., \u03bdI\u03bd = constant), the optical depth \u03c4(E) \u221d E. Note that in the first case, the\nobserved spectrum simply reproduces the spectrum emitted by the source, attenuated by a constant factor.\nThe energy dependence of the optical depth translates to strong modifications of the source spectrum even\nwith relatively small differences in \u03c4 , due to the exponential dependence. For example, given an intrinsic\npower-law spectrum dN\/dE \u221d E\u2212\u0393int , a difference of only one unit in \u03c4 between 0.2 and 1 TeV increases\nthe spectral index by \u2206\u0393 = \u0393obs \u2212 \u0393int = 0.62. Figure SI-1 shows the attenuation factor as a function of\nenergy in four relevant cases (P1.0, P0.4, P0.4+ENIR, P1.0+UV).\nFor a \u03b3-ray photon of a given energy E, because of the threshold effect (E\u01eb \u2265 (mec2)2), only EBL pho-\ntons of energy above threshold (i.e., \u03bb < \u03bbthr) contribute to the absorption. Also, because of the relative\nnarrowness of the \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 e+e\u2212 cross-section, for broad-band EBL spectra more than half of the interactions\noccur with a narrow interval of target photons \u2206\u03bb \u223c (1\u00b1 1\/2)\u03bb\u2217 (ref[6,19]) around the cross-section peak,\nwhere \u03bb\u2217 \u2248 1.4 (E\u03b3\/ 1TeV)\u00b5m (this relation is illustrated on the upper axis in Fig. SI-3 and SI-4, as a\nguideline). Thus, the optical depth at \u223c 0.2 TeV is controlled only by the EBL fluxes at UV\u2013O wavelengths\n(below 1 micron), since NIR photons are below the energy threshold, while the optical depth at \u223c 1 TeV is\ncontrolled mainly by the NIR flux. The UV\u2013O band has a more limited impact on\u223c 1 TeV photons since the\ninteractions occur far from the cross-section peak. An increase or decrease of the UV\u2013O flux alone changes\nthe optical depth at 0.2 TeV much more than at 1 TeV.\nTherefore, it is possible to reduce the energy dependence of the optical depth (and thus to avoid the hard\nreconstructed spectra) by assuming either very low O\u2013NIR fluxes (reducing \u03c4 at TeV energies) or very high\nUV\u2013O fluxes (increasing \u03c4 at sub-TeV energies; e.g., see Fig. SI-1, right panel).\n9\nComparison with earlier observations\nThese two new objects provide significantly stronger constraints on the EBL than any previous TeV blazar\nbecause of a favourable combination of hard observed spectrum and relatively high redshift. For sources at\nsmaller redshifts \u2206\u0393 is smaller, while at the same redshift a softer spectrum can be misinterpreted as a hard\nspectrum which has been more heavily absorbed. Both cases allow the EBL to have a wider range of possible\nfluxes without yielding implausible values in the reconstructed blazar spectrum. This is the reason why the\nTeV spectra of the two previous most distant objects, 1ES 1426+428 [11] (z=0.129, \u0393obs \u2243 3.5 \u00b1 0.4)\nand PKS 2155\u2212304 [10] (z=0.116, \u0393obs \u2243 3.3 \u2212 3.4 \u00b1 0.06), did not provide such strong constraints as\nthese two new sources, even when measured with much higher signal-to-noise ratio (PKS 2155\u2212304). The\nintrinsic spectra of H 1426+428 and PKS 2155\u2212304 start to become very hard (\u0393 < 1) for EBL fluxes\naround P1.0+ENIR and above.\nStatistical and systematics errors\nThe determination of an EBL limit from gamma-ray spectra needs to take into account the statistical and\nsystematic errors of the spectral determination, which amount for these data \u2013 at the 1\u03c3 level \u2013 to \u2206\u0393 \u2243 0.2\nand 0.1, respectively. In addition, the absolute energy scale of Cherenkov telescopes is only determined\nto \u223c 15%. The EBL limit can be different, therefore, because for example the true blazar spectrum can\nbe softer than the H.E.S.S. value, and the photon energies lower. Using the same \u0393int = 1.5 limit on the\nintrinsic spectrum, these errors can be translated into an equivalent uncertainty for the scaling factor P:\nnamely, by finding the values for which \u0393int \u00b1 \u2206\u0393int,stat \u00b1 \u2206\u0393int,sys = 1.5, and shifting the bin energies\n\u00b115%. For the 1ES 1101\u2212232 spectrum, which provides the most stringent constraints, the errors in \u0393\ntranslate to \u2206P \u2243 \u00b10.1 (the relation is linear, and is approximately \u2206P \u2243 0.34\u2206\u0393), and the energy scale\nerror into \u2206P \u2243 \u00b10.05. All three contributions (\u00b11\u03c3 statistical, \u00b10.1 systematic, \u00b115% energy scale\nuncertainty) combined yield \u2206P \u2243 \u00b10.15.\nGalaxy evolution effects\nIn the calculation of the optical depth, we have not included the effects of galaxy evolution between z=0 and\nz = 0.165 to 0.186. That is, we assume a constant (rather than decreasing with redshift) EBL co-moving\nenergy density. This corresponds to the assumption that all the background photons seen today were already\nin place at the source redshift. To estimate the impact of this approximation in the redshift range considered\nhere, we used the model by Primack [12] in 2001, interpolating a set of EBL SEDs as a function of redshift\n(kindly provided by the authors). Including galaxy evolution, the intrinsic spectra become \u2206\u0393 . 0.2 softer\nthan without evolution, thus loosening the limit on the scaling factor P by less than 0.1. Note, however,\nthat this effect can still be safely ignored when testing scenarios where the EBL is dominated by additional\nradiation produced in the early universe (for which our assumption fully holds).\n10\nFigure SI-1 Attenuation factor e\u2212\u03c4 for the redshift of 1ES 1101-232 (z=0.186), assuming different EBL\nSEDs. Left panel: P1.0, P0.4, P0.4 with ENIR added on (Fig. SI-3). Right panel: P1.0 and P1.0+UV.\nThese curves would correspond to the observed TeV spectrum for a source with a flat power-law emission\nspectrum (e.g., for a source spectral energy distribution E2dN\/dE with \u0393int = 2). Above 0.2 TeV, the\nincrease of \u03c4 with E steepens the spectrum, up to 1\u20132 TeV. Left panel: the thick lines (corresponding\nto P0.4, P1.0) show how an increase of the EBL normalization steepens the 0.2\u20131 TeV spectrum. The\ndashed line (P0.4+ENIR) shows how the addition of a NIR excess around \u223c 1\u00b5m dramatically steepens the\nspectrum, due to the increase of \u03c4 for 0.8\u20131 TeV photons, while photons at 0.1\u20130.3 TeV remain unaffected.\nAbove 2 TeV, the absorption curve corresponding to P0.4+ENIR even hardens with energy since P0.4+ENIR\nis characterized by a slope steeper than \u03bb\u22121 between 2 and 6\u00b5m. The right panel shows how an increase\nin the UV flux reduces the energy dependence of the optical depth, at the price of a higher attenuation\noverall.\n11\nFigure SI-2 The H.E.S.S. time-averaged spectrum of H 2356\u2212309 (green), and the absorption-corrected\ndata (blue) with the same EBL SEDs as for 1ES 1101\u2212232 (Fig. 1 and 2). The data points and the 99%\nupper limit are at the average photon energy for each bin, also used to calculate the optical depth for recon-\nstruction. Error bars are 1\u03c3 statistical errors. The lines show the best-fit power laws to the reconstructed\nspectrum (dN\/dE = N0(E\/TeV)\u2212\u0393int ), and the corresponding shapes including absorption.

The full line shows the EBL shape with the NIR excess added on to P0.4, while the right\npanel shows the corresponding absorption-corrected \u03b3-ray spectrum for 1ES 1101\u2212232. Also, for this EBL\nSED, the intrinsic spectrum is extremely hard (\u0393int = \u22120.7 between 0.1 and 2 TeV), with a very sharp rise\nbetween 0.3 and 1.5 TeV where the intrinsic slope becomes as hard as \u0393int = \u22121.2. This is due to the\nstrong difference in optical depths at these two energies, because the gamma-ray photons below 0.3 TeV\nare insensitive to the NIR excess > 1\u00b5m (since they are below the energy threshold for the \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 e+e\u2212\nprocess), whereas \u223c 1TeV photons are fully affected since the interaction takes place near the peak of\nthe \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 e+e\u2212 cross-section. The exclusion of the the IRTS data points between 1.4 and 2.2 \u00b5m (dashed\nline) is not enough to avoid very hard spectra (\u0393int \u2248 0.2): significantly lower NIR fluxes are needed, as\ndescribed in the main text. We note that ref[25] argues that the shape of the NIR excess between 1 and\n4\u00b5m is almost identical to the spectrum of the zodiacal light, and could therefore be of local instead of\nextragalactic origin.\n13\nFigure SI-4 Effect of modifications to the EBL SED in the UV and IR bands, for the same data as\nFig. SI-2. The short dashed line shows the additional UV component needed by P1.0 to soften the intrinsic\nspectrum down to \u0393int = 1.5, as shown in Fig. SI-2. This is the most energetically-economic solution, limited\nto the narrow range \u223c 0.2\u20130.4\u00b5m to have the maximum effect on the \u03b3-ray spectrum with the minimum UV\nflux and overall attenuation. The inclusion of ENIR would require even higher UV fluxes, in the case of both\nP1.0+ENIR and P0.4+ENIR. Above 2\u00b5m, a slope much flatter than our template (e.g. +IR, dot-dashed line)\nis not supported by either the H.E.S.S. (see Fig. SI-5) or HEGRA results [11], which instead suggest an\nEBL spectrum around \u221d \u03bb\u22121. If this is the case, it would constrain the EBL to be near the recent Spitzer\nsource counts [28], meaning that we are close to resolving the diffuse background also up to \u223c 8\u00b5m.\nFigure SI-5 The H.E.S.S. spectrum of 1ES 1101\u2212232, corrected for absorption with the EBL SED shown\nin Fig. SI-4. The P1.0+UV panel shows the spectral softening given by the additional UV component, at\nthe price of increased energetic requirements: the intrinsic TeV flux would be 3 orders of magnitude higher\nthan that observed, and \u223c 1.5\u20132 orders of magnitude above the blazar synchrotron peak, as indicated by\nsimultaneous X-ray data (Aharonian et al. 2006, in preparation). The P0.55+IR panel shows the hardening\ngiven by an EBL spectrum above 2\u00b5m which is flatter than our template (Fig. SI-4, dot-dashed line).\n14\nTable SI-1: H.E.S.S. spectral data.
