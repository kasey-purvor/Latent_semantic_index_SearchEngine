For intravascular brachytherapy with catheter-based systems, AAPM Task Group 60 has\nrecommended measurements that should be made to characterize the sources. Beta emitters, including\n90Sr\/90Y are ideal for intravascular brachytherapy, but problems arise in measuring dose distributions in the\nhigh dose gradient region at short distances from the source. In this paper, measurements of radial and\northogonal dose distributions and dose profiles for a 90Sr\/90Y source train using polyacrylamide gel (PAG)\ndosimetry and a high-field 4.7 Tesla MRI scanner are presented and compared with measurements made with\ntwo types of radiochromic film, MD-55 and HD-810. For the PAG system, the dose distributions were\ndetermined with in-plane resolutions of 0.4 mm and 0.2 mm. The measurements of absorbed dose distributions\nboth orthogonal and parallel to the source axis show good agreement between the PAG and radiochromic film.\nThe absolute dose at a radial distance of 2 mm in the central 32 mm of a line parallel to the axis was measured.\nFor the PAG the measured absorbed dose was 1.25% lower, for MD-55 4% higher and for the HD-810 1.6%\nhigher when compared with the value given by the source calibration. These results confirm that both absorbed\ndose and dose distributions for high gradient vascular brachytherapy sources can be measured using PAG but\nthe disadvantages of gel manufacture and the need for access to a high resolution scanner suggests that the use\nof radiochromic film is the method of choice.\nRecently, there has been much interest in the prevention\nof restenosis following angioplasty using intravascular\nirradiation. Different types of source are used for vascular\ntherapy, for example 90Sr\/90Y and 192Ir as a chain of seeds,\n90Y, and 32P as a metallic wire and 188Re as a liquid\nsource. Fox [1] has recently given a comprehensive review\nof intravascular brachytherapy of coronary arteries. The\nAmerican Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM)\nTask Group 60 [2] recommends that for sources used for\nintravascular brachytherapy the dose rate should be mea-\nsured 2 mm radially distant from the centre of the source\nand that the dose rate should be uniform to within \u00a110%\nover the central two-thirds of the treated length. In addi-\ntion, the relative dose should be measured from 0.5 mm to\nthe distance where 90% of the energy from a point source\nhas been absorbed at intervals of 0.5 mm in the plane\nperpendicular to the catheter axis through the centre of the\nsource. Compliance with these recommendations requires\na high-resolution dosimeter capable of making accurate\nmeasurements in regions with a high dose gradient.\nRadiochromic film is one method that has been used for\nthe dosimetry of vascular brachytherapy sources [3], but it\nis restricted to measurements in two dimensions, as are\nmeasurements with scintillator devices [4]. Polyacylamide\ngel (PAG) dosimetry has been used for measurements of\nseveral brachytherapy sources [5\u201310], and relies on\nradiation-induced cross-linking of the polymer, which\nalters both the optical density of the gel and the nuclear\nrelaxation behaviour of the gel water. Changes in optical\ndensity may be used in optical dosimetry [11, 12] but will\nnot be discussed further in this paper. In MRI dosimetry,\nthe changes in the nuclear transverse relaxation rate (R2)\n(the inverse of the relaxation time (T2)) with dose are\nexploited. Using PAG as a dosimeter has the advantages\nthat the distributions can be measured in three dimensions,\nthe gel is both dosimeter and phantom, and the gel is\ntissue equivalent [7]. To date, in-plane resolution for the\ndose distributions from gel dosimeters has been reported in\nthe range from 0.1 mm to 1.5 mm for MRI [6, 7, 13\u201315].\nIn principle, the spatial resolution achievable in MRI is\ndetermined by the strength of the magnetic field gradient\nthat is applied to achieve spatial discrimination. However,\nin practice, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) depends\ninversely on the third power of the spatial resolution, so\nthat the resolution that is achievable in practice is limited\nby SNR, which in turn depends on the strength of the\nstatic polarising magnetic field and on the time available\nfor scanning [13, 16]. Using a high-field MRI system, the\nresolution achievable may be sufficient for the needs of\nvascular brachytherapy dosimetry.\nThe purpose of this paper is to compare radiochromic\nfilm dosimetry with PAG in meeting the requirements of\nAAPM Task Group 60 [2].\nMaterials and methods\nSources\nThe radiation source used in this investigation was a\nhigh doserate 90Sr\/90Y source train from a BetacathTM\nReceived 4 December 2002 and in revised form 18 June 2003, accepted\n24 July 2003.\nAddress correspondence to D E Bonnett.\nThe British Journal of Radiology, 76 (2003), 824\u2013831 E 2003 The British Institute of Radiology\nDOI: 10.1259\/bjr\/25639755\n824 The British Journal of Radiology, November 2003\ndevice (Novoste, Norcross, CA). The source consisted of a\ntrain of 16 90Sr\/90Y pellets encapsulated in a strontium\ntitanate ceramic. 90Sr\/90Y is a high-energy beta emitter\nwith maximum energy of 2.28 MeV. Each pellet had an\nouter diameter of 0.65 mm and a length of 2.5 mm. The\nsources were transported hydraulically from the source\ncontainer in the BetacathTM using a catheter of 1.6 mm\ndiameter with three lumen: one for the sources, one for the\nreturn fluid, and one for the guide wire. A syringe filled\nwith sterile water drove the hydraulic delivery system.\nGel preparation and irradiation\nThe polymer gels employed in this study were prepared\nin a glove box using the method described by Farajollahi\net al [7] with modifications to the phantom filling system\ndeveloped De Deene et al [17] and Love [18]. The oxygen\nconcentration inside the glove box was monitored, and\nwas always less than 0.2%. As an additional precaution,\nthe preparation was carried out in a dark room to\nminimize any polymerization brought about by ultraviolet\nlight. All polymer gel preparations used gelatine of type A\n(acid derived), approximately 300 Bloom (Sigma Aldrich,\nDorset, UK), electrophoresis-grade acrylamide monomer\nand N,N9-methylene-bis-acrylamide cross-linker (ICN\nBiomedical Ltd, Basingstoke, UK); de-ionised water was\nused as the solvent. Oxygen free nitrogen gas was used to\nremove dissolved oxygen from the de-ionised water and gel\nsolution. Typically, the gas was bubbled through the water\nfor a period of up to 30 min, depending on the volume of\nwater and flow-rate of the nitrogen. It was found that the\ntime for deoxygenation was proportional to the volume\nand inversely proportional to the flow-rate of the nitrogen,\nas would be expected. The gel was prepared in a reaction\nflask and transferred to different calibration tubes and\nphantoms inside the glove box. The composition of the\npolymer gel used was 5% gelatin, 3.5% acrylamide and\n3.5% N,N9-methylene-bis-acrylamide by weight.\nThe gel samples used for calibration were irradiated in\nglass tubes approximately 100 mm long and 25 mm in\ndiameter closed at one end. The phantoms used for the\nbrachytherapy sources had either an insert of BarexTM (BP\nChemicals, London, UK) with a 2 mm inner diameter and\n4 mm outer diameter, or a glass insert with a 2 mm inner\ndiameter and 3 mm outer diameter. Both types of insert\nwere closed at one end. The dimensions of brachytherapy\nphantoms were 143 mm long and 28 mm outer diameter\nfor phantom with the glass insert and 150 mm long and\n25 mm outer diameter for phantom with the BarexTM\ninsert. BarexTM has the advantage of having a relatively\nlow density of 1.156103 kg?m23, with high oxygen barrier\nproperties [19]. The insert was positioned along the central\naxis of the glass tube, and held in position with a rubber\nstopper as shown in Figure 1. This initial design of\nphantom was limited by the inability of the rubber stopper\nto keep the insert supported centrally in the glass tube and\ndifficulties were experienced in manufacturing BarexTM\ninserts from sheet material. An improved design of\nphantom was also constructed using a glass tube with\nglass thickness of 0.5 mm. This tube was also closed at one\nend and sealed with quartz quick-fit stopper (Figure 1).\nGlass is more rigid with higher density (2.336103 kg?m23)\nand may perturb the beta radiation but gave more\naccurate positioning of the sources. Figure 1 also shows\nthe areas of radiation-induced polymerization caused by\nthe 90Sr\/90Y source train. Another phantom was made\nwhich simulated a curved coronary artery. For this\nphantom, a glass tube 115 mm long with 2 mm inner\nand 3 mm outer diameter was bent through an angle of\n100\u02da (angle of arc) and was open at both ends. The tube\nwas then inserted into a rectangular BarexTM phantommea-\nsuring 40 mm640 mm6125 mm. The rectangular phantom\nwas then filled with gel.\nCalibration vials were irradiated to doses of 0 Gy, 2 Gy,\n4 Gy, 6 Gy and 8 Gy using a 6 MV photon beam with a\n150 mm6150 mm field. The response of PAG based on\nthe formulations given by Maryanski et al [5, 6] has been\nreported to be independent of energy for a wide range of\nphoton and electron beams by several authors [6\u20138]. More\nrecently, some energy dependence has been reported [20]\nfor the formulation based on acrylic acid and N,N9-\nmethylene-bis-acrylamide [6]. This investigation related to\nthe energy dependence of gel sensitivity, which can depend\non many factors. The calibration tubes were irradiated\nFigure 1. Polyacrylamide gel (PAG) phantom with a glass\n(left) and a BarexTM (right) insert after an irradiation of 8 Gy\nwith 90Sr\/90Y sources.\nA comparison of polyacrylamide gel and radiochromic film\n825The British Journal of Radiology, November 2003\n5 cm deep in a Perspex holder and were rotated through\n180\u02da halfway through the irradiation to give a uniform\ndose distribution. The phantoms were irradiated using\n90Sr\/90Y sources to doses of 8 Gy and 10 Gy at 2 mm\nradial distance from the source centre. Previous work\nhas shown that the linearity of the gel response to\nabsorbed dose using this formulation and method of\nmanufacture extends to 12 Gy [7]. The absorbed doses\nwere calculated using source calibration data traceable to\nNIST (USA).\nMRI\nHigh-resolution images were obtained using a 4.7\nTesla MR imaging spectrometer (Varian, Palo Alto,\nCA), with a corresponding proton resonance frequency\nof 200 MHz. A quadrature receiver coil with a 60 mm\ndiameter was used for radiofrequency pulse transmission,\nand for reception of the NMR signal. The straight inserts\nthat had contained the catheter were air filled and the\ncurved insert was filled with water for the imaging process.\nWater was added to the curved insert to reduce the\npossibility of magnetic susceptibility artefacts that have\nbeen reported for air filled catheters [9]. The straight\ninserts were closed at one end and the small bore did not\npermit air to escape when attempts were made to fill them\nwith water.\nMRI measurements of the transverse relaxation rate\n(R2) of the polyacrylamide gels took place between 20 days\nand 30 days after irradiation, at which time the degree of\npolymerization has been shown to be stable [21]. This time\nwas longer than usually used and was governed by the\navailability of the spectrometer. MRI scanning was\nperformed at room temperature using a single echo spin-\necho sequence, repeated with echo times (TE) of 25 ms,\n150 ms and 300 ms. The repetition time (TR) was 3000 ms\nand the in-plane image resolution was either 0.2 mm or\n0.4 mm. Slice thicknesses were 1 mm and 0.5 mm for the\n0.4 mm and 0.2 mm in-plane resolutions, respectively. The\nk-space data matrix was 2566256 in all cases, and data\nwere acquired at least twice and signal averaged in order\nto improve the SNR, and to enable phase cycling of the\nradiofrequency pulses, thus reducing image artefacts.\nImaging times were of the order of 1 h for 0.4 mm\nresolution, while for 0.2 mm resolution, imaging times of\n10 h were used in order to reduce the standard error in the\nR2 readings to less than \u00a13%.\nIt has been observed that change in R2 is proportional\nto the radiation dose over a limited region, typically\n0\u201312 Gy, (e.g. [5, 7]) and so by measuring R2, the absorbed\ndose can be estimated in this region. Neglecting any effect\nof diffusion through the magnetic field gradients used for\nimaging, in a single-echo spin-echo MRI, the signal\nintensity varies according to:\nS~S0e{TE\n.R2 \u00f01\u00de\nTE is the echo time, and S0 is the signal intensity at zero\necho time. R2 was estimated on a pixel-by-pixel basis from\nthe signal intensities of the three images at the different\necho times, by non-linear regression using the Levenberg-\nMarquardt algorithm [22]. The relationship between R2\nand radiation dose was established by measuring the R2 of\nthe calibration samples, and then fitting a straight line of\nthe form:\nR2~R2bzo.D \u00f02\u00de\nwhere R2b is value of R2 for the background (unirradiated)\ngel; D is the radiation dose; and r is the dose\u2013response\nof the gel. Having established R2b and r, subsequent\nestimation of R2 as part of a dosimetric measurement\nallows an image of radiation dose to be computed.\nRadiochromic film dosimetry\nTwo types of radiochromic film were used for film\ndosimetry. The first type, known as HD-810 (Nuclear\nAssociates, Hicksville, NY) consists of a single layer of\nradiation sensitive emulsion, approximately 7 mm thick, on a\n0.22 mm polyester base. The second type of film is known as\nMD-55 (Nuclear Associates). This is a laminated film\ncomposed of two pieces of 0.27 mm polyester base, each\nwith a nominal 15 mm thick coating. Recommendations\non the use of radiochromic film have been given in the\nliterature [23]. The films were read with a manual\nRadiochromic Densitometer (Model 37-443, Nuclear\nAssociates) with an ultra bright LED light source with a\npeak wavelength of 660 nm. To improve the resolution of\nthis device, the aperture of 2 mm was reduced to 0.3 mm\nby the addition of an annular insert. Initial work was\ncarried out to investigate the energy dependence for MD-\n55 and HD-810 film for a range of electron energies from\n1.3 MeV to 4 MeV and for 300 kV photons and 6 MV\nphotons. A calibration curve of optical density versus\nabsorbed dose was determined between 0 and 32 Gy for\nthe MD-55 and between 0 and 120 Gy for the HD-810 film\nusing 6 MV X-rays. Electrons in the range 1.3 MeV to\n3.8 MeV were obtained from a Betatron (model CMB10\nmanufactured by the Tomsk Polytechnical University,\nRussia) and the 4 MeV electrons from a linear accelerator\n(Elekta, UK).\nA solid, water equivalent phantom (WTe, St\nBartholomew\u2019s Hospital, London) was designed for\nirradiating the film using the 90Sr\/90Y source train. The\nrectangular phantom was constructed in two halves to\nform a block 38 mm638 mm650 mm with a 1.8 mm hole\ndrilled down the central axis of the phantom into which\nthe catheter was inserted. For each film type, two pieces of\nfilm, measuring 20 mm660 mm were carefully placed on\neither side of the central hole. The MD-55 film was\nnominally exposed to 20 Gy at 2 mm and the HD-810 was\nnominally exposed to 32 Gy at 2 mm. The AAPM\nrecommendations for radiochromic film dosimetry were\nfollowed [23].\nResults\nAn R2 image in a coronal plane is shown in Figure 2\nand a sagittal view is shown in Figure 3 together with an\nimage of the curved phantom. There was no evidence of\nartefacts due to magnetic susceptibility variations within\nthe phantom for either the straight insert, which could not\nbe filled with water, or for the curved insert, which was\nwater-filled.\nA calibration curve for the PAG is shown in Figure 4;\nthe number of calibration points was limited by the\navailable scanner time. The parameters of the linear fit to\nM N Amin, M A Horsfield, D E Bonnett et al\n826 The British Journal of Radiology, November 2003\nthe calibration data for the 4.7 T MRI scanner were\nR251.58+0.27D, where D is the absorbed dose.\nThe measurement of the response of radiochromic MD-\n55 and radiochromic HD-810 film to a range of electron\nenergies from 1.3 MeV to 4 MeV and for 300 kV photons\nand 6 MV photons are shown in Figure 5. The results\nindicate little or no dependence on energy. Calibration\ncurves for both types for 6 MV X-rays are shown in\nFigure 6. For MD-55 and HD-810, the linear fit\nparameters were optical density50.014+0.046D and optical\ndensity50.029+0.009D, respectively, where D is the\nabsorbed dose.\nThe variation in absorbed dose with distance orthogonal\nto the axis of the source train for both glass (0.2 mm in-\nplane resolution) and BarexTM inserts (0.25 mm in-plane\nresolution) together with the results obtained using radio-\nchromic film is shown in Figure 7. The achievable\nresolution was constrained by the available scan time.\nThe data from the curved insert was found to be identical\nwith that from the straight insert. There was no evidence\nof dose overestimation in the high dose area due to\nmonomer diffusion during irradiation [10]. The irradiation\ntimes in this experiment were quite short compared with\nthe long iradiation times (1024 s) reported by De Deene\net al [10]. Profiles parallel to the catheter axis at a radial\ndistance of 2 mm from the source centre for PAG with a\nglass insert compared with measurements using radio-\nchromic film are shown in Figure 8. In Figure 9, a\nmeasurement with 0.2 mm in-plane resolution with a\nglass insert is compared with measurements with both\nBarexTM and glass inserts with 0.4 mm in-plane resolution.\nA radial plot of uniformity of R2 measured using PAG is\nshown in Figure 10.\nThe absorbed doses measured 2 mm from the centre of\nthe source chain in the plane perpendicular to the catheter\naxis through the centre of the source using PAG, MD-55\nand HD-810 films are given in Table 1.\nDiscussion\nThe measurements of absorbed dose orthogonal to the\nsource axis (Figure 7) show good agreement between the\nFigure 2.

The error bars represent the\nstandard error in the mean of several measurements made at\ndifferent positions inside the calibration tubes, and the errors\nare a result of not only random noise but also image artefacts,\nthe magnitude of which depended on the position of the cali-\nbration tube inside the receiver coil.\nA comparison of polyacrylamide gel and radiochromic film\n827The British Journal of Radiology, November 2003\nFigure 5.

Results are normalized to 2 mm from the\ncentre of the source train. The error bars for the gel data were\nomitted for the sake of clarity. Errors for the PAG data were\nestimated to be \u00a15.6% (1 standard deviation) based on the\nvariation in dose in the low dose region.\nFigure 8. A comparison of profiles measured using polyacryla-\nmide gel and radiochromic film parallel to the catheter axis at\na radial distance of 2 mm from the source centre.\nFigure 9. Measured profiles using polyacrylamide gel (PAG)\nand imaged with in-plane resolutions of 0.4 mm compared with\nPAG with a glass insert imaged with 0.2 mm in-plane resolution.\nM N Amin, M A Horsfield, D E Bonnett et al\n828 The British Journal of Radiology, November 2003\nPAG and MD-55 radiochromic film. The HD-810 gives\nsome slightly higher measured absorbed doses. The thin\nglass-walled insert does not appear to make a significant\ndifference compared with the tissue equivalent BarexTM\ninsert. Normalized dose versus radial distance from the\nsource centre at three different positions (left, middle and\nright) of the curve phantom were also compared with the\ndepth dose curve of the cardiovascular glass phantom; no\nsignificant differences were observed except the fall off in\ndose at the end of the middle position.\nFor the profiles parallel to the source axis there is good\nagreement between the PAG with a glass insert (in-plane\nresolution 0.4 mm) and the two measurements with\nradiochromic film (Figure 8) with the exception of the\nfall off in dose at the end of the train. Similar distributions\nwere measured with the BarexTM insert. The profiles\nmeasured with the highest resolution (0.2 mm) with a glass\ninsert (Figure 9) show much more variation in the profile\nthan the other measurements, with the exception of the\nmeasurements with the BarexTM insert (Figure 9).\nUndulations were also observed for all profiles, for\nwhich there are several possible explanations. First is\nthat the outer diameter of the source train was 0.64 mm\nwhile the inner diameter of the catheter was 0.81 mm, so it\ncould be that the sources were slightly displaced from the\ncatheter axis with different source positions for each\nirradiation. Second, it is possible that the catheter was\nbent inside the phantom; however special care was taken\nto keep the catheter straight, at least in the vicinity of the\nsources. Finally, there might have been variations in\nsource position giving rise to small gaps between one seed\nand the next. The radial plot of R2 values (Figure 10)\nshows the angular variation to be within\u00a15% of the mean\nvalue. It was not possible to measure this distribution\nusing radiochromic film and the current setup.\nThe ability of PAG gels to measure absolute doses\naccurately has been the cause of much debate, and large\ndifferences have been recorded [7, 24, 25]. It is possible\nthat the difference in size between the main phantom and\ncalibration tubes is a contributory factor. Farajollahi and\nBonnett [26] reported that the slope of the gel dose\nresponse had been measured as 0.24\u00a10.01 s21 Gy21 for\nsmall calibration vials, and 0.33\u00a10.003 s21 Gy21 for a\nlarge phantom. Another possible contributory factor is the\ntemperature difference between the phantoms and calibra-\ntion vials at the time of scanning, since R2 is strongly\ndependent on the temperature. McJury et al [9] commen-\nted on this effect in the context of heating inside the\nradiofrequency coil. In addition, variations in the manu-\nfacturing process [27] or the thermal history of the samples\n[28] may cause differences between calibration samples and\nphantoms. In this present set of experiments, calibration\nvials and phantoms had almost identical dimensions, so\ntemperature and size difference should not have affected\nthe results to any significant degree.\nThe absorbed dose along the source axis at 2 mm\ndistance from the source centre was measured (Table 1).\nUncertainty in the given dose was 1.6% (0.13 Gy for 8 Gy)\naccording to the source calibration data. In addition, since\nwe used a manual transportation system, there are also\npotential timing errors. Estimated timing errors are of the\norder of 2 s, giving a further error in dose of \u00a10.24 Gy at\n2 mm radial distance. Thus, the total uncertainty for the\nerrors summed in quadrature for a dose of 8 Gy was\n\u00a10.3 Gy (4%), and the measured dose is not significantly\ndifferent from the given dose (1.25%). Both phantoms and\ncalibration vials were measured on the same day.\nAdditional measurements indicated that if all measure-\nments were not carried out at the same time then the\ndifference between the given and measured absorbed doses\ncould be of the order of 7%. Within a region 36.4 mm\nalong the source axis, the maximum dose recorded was\n8.5 Gy, which is 6.8% higher than mean dose and the\nminimum dose recorded was 7.3 Gy, 7.5% lower than\nthe mean. One possible cause of the difference between\nthe maximum and minimum doses was the bending of the\ncatheter within the tube, since the inner diameter of the\nphantom tube was approximately 2 mm, while the outer\ndiameter of the catheter is around 1.6 mm. Some of the\nsources may also have been slightly displaced from the\ncatheter axis.\nIn both experiments the measured absorbed dose was\nslightly lower than the given dose, which could be because\nof extra absorption by the glass insert, which is denser\nthan tissue. The BarexTM tube was neither uniformly\ncircular, nor perfectly straight, so it was difficult to mea-\nsure absolute dose accurately and this was not attempted.\nFor the MD-55 film, the dose was measured along a line\nparallel to the catheter axis, 33 mm in length, at a radial\ndistance of 2 mm from the axis. In this experiment the\nmeasured dose was only 4% higher than that prescribed.\nAlong the treated length the highest recorded value was\n22.5 Gy, which is 8.2% higher than the mean value, and\nthe lowest value was 18.8 Gy, 9.6% lower than the mean.\nThe standard deviation was \u00a14.2% for the dose measured\nalong the central 33 mm, 2 mm from the catheter axis. For\nFigure 10. Radial plot of R2 measured at 2 mm radial distance\nfrom the source centre at 15\u02da intervals.\nTable 1.

The mean mea-\nsured dose was 1.6% higher than that prescribed. Along\nthe treated length, the differences between the highest and\nlowest values and the mean value were 9.9% and 7.6%,\nrespectively. The standard deviation was \u00a15.2% for the\ndose measured 2 mm from the catheter axis. It should be\nnoted that in these experiments the source train met all the\nAAPM Task Group 60 acceptance criteria.\nWith the relatively high field strength used in our study,\nwe were able to achieve in-plane resolution of down to\n0.2 mm, with slice thicknesses of 0.5 mm. However, this\nrequired long scan times in order to achieve good SNR.\nThe strength of the relationship between resolution and\nscan time shows, however, that with only slightly poorer\nresolution, more acceptable scan times of around 1 h\nwould give adequate resolution for scanning intravascular\nbrachytherapy dosimeters.\nConclusion\nThese results indicate that PAG dosimeters can be used\nto measure the dose distributions specified by the AAPM\n[2] for vascular brachytherapy sources with high resolution\nMRI, and that more complex geometries can be investi-\ngated in future. If a higher resolution of 0.2 mm is used,\nthen the results show more variation in the absorbed dose\nprofiles and this requires further investigation. This\ntechnique is, however, restricted to centres with access\nto high resolution MRI, which is an obvious disadvantage.\nA further disadvantage is that stringent procedures must\nbe followed to exclude oxygen during the gel manufactur-\ning process, although this can now be avoided since\ncommercially-prepared gels are now available for pur-\nchase, e.g. BANGTM gels, MGS Inc., USA. Alternatively,\nit may be possible to use new types of gel that are\ncurrently under investigation, and which are claimed to be\nless affected by dissolved oxygen (the so-called \u2018\u2018MAGIC\u2019\u2019\ngels [29]). On the other hand, radiochromic film is readily\navailable and only requires the use of a relatively\ninexpensive densitometer. These investigations indicate\nthat, whilst it would be difficult to measure radial\ndistributions, the use of radiochromic film would be the\nmethod of choice for the measurements of absorbed dose\ndistributions parallel and orthogonal to a source train used\nfor intravascular brachytherapy.\nAcknowledgments\nWe wish to thank Dr John Mills for the use of the\nBetatron at the Walsgrave Hospital, Coventry; Dr Andrew\nGlendinning for his help with the external beam irradia-\ntions; Dr Charlie Deehan for his support and encourage-\nment; Dr Paul Kinchesh of Queen Mary and Westfield\nCollege, London, for his expertise and use of the MRI\nfacility; and Mike Squires and the mechanical workshop at\nthe Department of Medical Physics, University Hospitals\nof Leicester for his help in constructing some of the\napparatus.\nReferences\n1.
