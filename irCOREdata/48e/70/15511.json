Here we discuss the findings of a small-scale, qualitative\nstudy which mapped the impacts of a multi-intervention programme on participants\u2019\nhealth, wellbeing and employability. Each of the 13 interventions was independently\nappraised through focus groups or semi-structured interviews. Thematic analyses revealed\nthat participants from all interventions reported increased self-confidence, with several\nindividuals suggesting that project involvement had facilitated their movement into the\nlabour market. While the findings illustrate some positive outcomes, we argue that\ngovernment policy needs to consider more carefully strategies that also address the\ndemand side of the labour market.\nI n t roduct ion\nIn this article, we consider the impact of employability initiatives on health, wellbeing\nand attachment to the labour market by exploring the experiences of participants using\nqualitative methods. In the UK, the government has announced a new wave of welfare\nreform targeting what is described as a \u2018culture of worklessness\u2019. For example, in the\n2008 Green Paper on Welfare Reform, substantial changes to Incapacity Benefit (IB)\nwere announced (Bambra, 2008). From October 2008, IB was replaced with a new, and\nsupposedly simplified, two tier system of Employment and Support Allowance (payable\nat the same rate as Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance) supplemented by an additional support\ncomponent for those judged incapable of working by a medically administered test\n(DWP, 2008). However, those individuals deemed sick but able to work are compelled to\nundertake some form of work-related activity (e.g. Pathways to Work) in order to receive\nadditional support. The conditionality attached to ESA is more complex than simply a\nrequirement to participate in an employability scheme and includes (depending on the\nindividual claimant): participation in a work capability assessment and work focussed\ninterviews; completion of a work action plan; engaging with advisors and other support\nmechanisms where necessary and co-ownership of the return to work process (Gregg,\n2008). The ESA was brought into effect for new claimants from October 2008 and existing\n337\nJoyce, K. E. et al.\nclaimants will be moved onto ESA from 2010 onwards. For a more detailed discussion of\nthe implications arising from the introduction of ESA see Bambra and Smith (in press).\nGiven this new conditionality with regards to health-related benefits, as well as the\nannouncement of further conditionality amongst JSA claimants (e.g. community work\nafter two years unemployment), it is important to examine how participants experience\nemployability programmes and draw attention to any tensions or problems concerning\nthese programmes. Here we explore the impacts of some short-term projects and draw\nparticular attention to the absence of interventions which tackle structural barriers to\nemployment. In conclusion, the article calls on policymakers to refocus their approach\nto worklessness by instead considering a longer-term, multi-pronged response which will\ntackle both demand and supply-side factors.\nWor k l e s s n e s s an d h e a l t h\nAlthough often criticised for its ambiguity, \u2018worklessness\u2019 has emerged as a prominent\ngovernment discourse and as an important focus for policy interventions (Danson, 2005).\nGroups disproportionately affected by worklessness include lone parents, minority ethnic\ngroups, people with a disability or chronic health condition, over 50s, offenders\/ex-\noffenders and drug users (Ritchie et al., 2005). Individuals may face multiple barriers to\nemployment, such as a lack of job-relevant skills and experience and problems accessing\nthe work environment (often relating to transport and carer costs) (Danziger et al., 2002).\nThese often overlapping difficulties mean that helping individuals move from welfare into\nwork may not easily be addressed by single, linear interventions (Gardiner, 1997; Bambra\net al., 2005; Ritchie et al., 2005). This is particularly likely to be the case where changes\nin local economies have restricted employment options.\nAs has been well documented (Campbell, 2000; Danson, 2005), there have been\nsignificant changes in the UK\u2019s labour market over the past few decades, particularly in\nrelation to a declining manufacturing and heavy industry sector. This has contributed to\nincreased rates of worklessness, especially in areas where employment was previously\ndominated by heavy industries, such as County Durham. One consequence of these\nlabour market changes, as, McDonald and Marsh (2000) describe, is that the transition into\nemployment for many young people has altered from a simple transition into and between\ntrade\/manual jobs to what they describe as cyclical movement between unemployment,\ngovernment schemes and jobs at the bottom end of the labour market. Individuals\ncaught in this \u2018low pay, no pay\u2019 cycle are a key target for policymakers interested in\ntackling worklessness. Moreover, Beatty and Fothergill (2005: 838) describe the problem\nof hidden unemployment in former industrial areas and argue that \u2018large scale joblessness\u2019\nis camouflaged by increasing numbers of incapacity claimants. Importantly, the authors\nnote that \u2018this diversion [from unemployment to sickness benefits] has happened\npredominantly in the older industrial areas of the North, Scotland and Wales\u2019 (Beatty\nand Fothergill, 2005: 852) and is likely to be as a consequence of deindustrialisation.\nIn an attempt to tackle worklessness, government schemes, such as New Deal and\nPathways to Work, have been developed and targeted at specific groups across England\nand Wales, including unemployed people who are both young (16\u201325) and over-50, and\ngroups considered to be particularly vulnerable to social exclusion, such as lone parents\nand people experiencing disability or chronic illness (Martin et al., 2003). However, the\n338\nMost of industry\u2019s shutting down up here. . .\neffectiveness of such programmes is unclear. For example, recent systematic reviews of\nwelfare to work programmes targeted at people with a disability or chronic illness by\nBambra et al. (2005) and Hillage et al. (2008) were both inconclusive. Similarly, although\nthere is a rich qualitative literature on this topic, much of this is dominated by a focus on\nthe employment experiences of participants and it does not tend to examine the wider\nimpacts of the interventions or the contexts in which they operate. It is therefore uncertain\nwhether the UK government\u2019s attempts to reduce the number of people workless and in\nreceipt of benefits by focusing on labour supply (Turok and Webster, 1998) have been\neffective. It is also unclear whether the introduction of sanctions is likely to increase\nmovement back to employment, especially since it is based on the presumption that\nunemployed groups require further incentives to look for work when, in fact, research (in\nthe UK and elsewhere in Europe) suggests that many people who are out of work are keen\nto increase their involvement in the labour market (Easterlow and Smith, 2003; Fletcher,\n2007; Hyggen, 2007). The study presented here attempts to address these gaps by drawing\ntogether interpretive data on individuals\u2019 contextual accounts of their participation in one\nof 13 different employability interventions (see Table 1). The overarching aim of the\nevaluation was to examine the effects of this multi-intervention programme (detailed in\nTable 1) on participants\u2019 health, wellbeing and employability. The discussion inspired\nby these questions is then broadened out to reflect on what this research suggests about\npolicy responses to worklessness in the UK more generally. It should be noted, however,\nthat this is not a discursive piece on the dynamics of worklessness rather the aim of\nthe paper is to report on participants\u2019 views and experiences regarding a number of\ndifferent employability projects implemented in a defined study context, which will now\nbe described.\nCon tex t : Sedgefie ld , Coun t y Du rham\nSedgefield is an area (and until April 2009 a district council) in south eastern County\nDurham in the North East of England. Between April and June 2009 the North East had\nthe highest workless household rate at 23.2 per cent compared with other government\noffice regions. Sedgefield continues to be affected by the legacy of changing labour\nmarkets and the decline of manufacturing industries and the coalfields. Accordingly, the\neffects of the current global recession are heightened for the former mining villages and\nrural towns in the area. In Sedgefield, 21 of 56 (37.5 per cent) super output areas (SOAs)\nare ranked within the most deprived 20 per cent of SOAs nationally and three SOAs (5.4\nper cent) are ranked within the most deprived 10 per cent SOAs (Government Office\nfor the North East, 2007). Unemployment rates in Sedgefield are well above the national\naverage (6.9 per cent between January and December 2008 versus 5.7 per cent nationally\n(ONS, 2009a)) and incapacity benefit claims in the working age population are amongst\nthe highest in the country (12 per cent as of August 2007 \u2013 ONS, 2009b).\nIn terms of health indicators, the area is known to suffer a disproportionate burden\nof disease: incidence rates of coronary heart disease between 2003 and 2005 were\ncalculated as 113.5 cases per 100,000 population compared with 90.5 cases per 100,000\nin the UK over the same period (Communities and Local Government, 2007). Equally, the\nrate of cancer mortality between 2003 and 2005 was 146.4 per 100,000 population\nin Sedgefield compared with 119 per 100,000 population nationally (Communities\n339\nJoyce, K.

There is also a gap in life expectancy associated with\nsocioeconomic deprivation, with women and men in the least deprived areas living on\naverage three and four (respectively) years longer than women and men in the most\ndeprived SOAs (APHO and DoH, 2008).\nMethodo logy\nThe aim of the qualitative approach to the study was to gain some insights into the worlds,\nbeliefs and views of those involved in the employability interventions (Jowett and O\u2019Toole,\n2006; Kvale, 1996). Focus groups (one per project) were used to explore the views of\n340\nMost of industry\u2019s shutting down up here. . .\nparticipants involved in 11 of the projects, but, due to the sensitivity of some of the\nissues involved, it was deemed more appropriate to employ face-to-face interviews with\nparticipants in the Young Parent\u2019s Outreach Worker project and the Counselling Service.\nAltogether 84 individuals participated in the focus groups\/interviews, all of which were\nundertaken shortly after (i.e. within 1\u20132 months) the intervention had been delivered.\nThe research was approved in advance by Durham University School for Health Ethics\nCommittee.\nParticipants were recruited through the intervention leaders who adopted a\n\u2018gatekeeping\u2019 role. Although asked to recruit participants offering a broad range of views,\nthis method is clearly not without bias, as gatekeepers are likely \u2013 either wittingly or\nunwittingly \u2013 to recruit individuals who regularly attended and engaged most fully with\nthe programme, which may lead to more positive responses. Further, it is important to note\nhere that the sample of participants is inevitably self-selecting, given that participation in\nthe employability schemes was voluntary (in contrast to the conditionality imposed by\nthe new ESA). Consequently, the participants in our research may well have been closer\nto the labour market than other incapacity benefit claimants in the area who did not\nengage in these kinds of initiatives. Nevertheless, the data reveal a range of concerns with\nboth barriers to work in the local labour market and with the programme itself, providing\nuseful and policy-relevant insights to those interested in welfare to work schemes.\nThe focus group sessions varied in length, lasting between 30 and 60 minutes, with\nfour to six participants in each. Two members of the research team were present at\neach focus group: one to facilitate the discussion, the other to take field notes and to\nensure all topics had been addressed. Semi-structured interviews ranged from 15 to\n53 minutes in length and were either conducted on a face-to-face basis or by telephone.\nWith the exception of the Young People\u2019s Outreach Worker programmes, focus groups\nand interviews were conducted at venues where the programmes had been delivered. A\nthematic topic guide for the focus groups (and adapted for the semi-structured interviews)\nwas informed by the existing literature-base relating to return-to-work schemes and\nby the experiences of the research team and included questions relating to: barriers\nexperienced to employment; advantages and disadvantages of the intervention; impacts\nof the intervention on physical and psychosocial health as well as attachment to the\nlabour market; ways in which the intervention addressed or failed to address barriers to\nemployment; ways in which the intervention could be improved; remaining problems or\nbarriers to employment.\nBoth focus group and interview discussions were audio-recorded and transcribed\nverbatim before being coded using Atlas.Ti (a qualitative analysis software package) by\nKJ and KS. The coding framework for analysis was derived abductively by analysing the\ndata, transcript by transcript, to identify emergent themes (Miles and Huberman, 1994).\nTo resolve any inconsistencies, data interpretations and emergent themes were discussed\nby all members of the research team until a consensus was reached. All extracts from the\ndata have been fully anonymised and the codes accompanying quotations refer to the\nacronyms of the different interventions being appraised (see Table 1).\nF ind ings\nThe following account of the data is divided into sections that focus on the impacts (from\nparticipants\u2019 perspectives) of the various projects on health, wellbeing and employability,\n341\nJoyce, K. E. et al.\nFigure 1. Interconnected themes relating to participants\u2019 experiences of the employability interventions.\nbut it should be recognised that each of these areas inter-links with the others (see Figure 1).\nThe paper then turns its attention to exploring some of the concerns participants expressed\nabout the short-term nature and supply-side focus of the interventions. Figure 1 illustrates\nthe overlapping nature of the outcomes relating to the different intervention types. Most\nnoteworthy is the finding that participants from all intervention types reported some\nkind of benefit relating to wellbeing. The lines encompassing health-related programmes\nand volunteering and placements are not meant to imply that these intervention types\ncaused health or employment effects exclusively. Rather the outcomes relating to health\nwere reported throughout many of the intervention types, but especially by participants\nof the health-related programmes. Likewise, employment outcomes were reported by\nindividuals in several intervention types but were most commonly by individuals on\nvolunteering or work placement programmes.\nHea l t h\nMost of the impacts that participants discussed directly with respect to their \u2018health\u2019\nwere associated either with pain management or lifestyle-behaviours. For example, some\nparticipants in four of the health-related programmes (all except Counselling, which\nfocused on mental, rather than physical health) reported that they were adapting their\nlifestyle-behaviours as a result of their participation in the programme. For some, this\ninvolved learning about and adopting preventative measures such as taking more exercise\n342\nMost of industry\u2019s shutting down up here. . .\nand eating a healthier diet. For others, the benefits included learning relaxation or exercise\ntechniques that enabled them to better manage existing conditions. Participants in the\nLower Back Pain service placed a particular emphasis on the way in which the intervention\nhad aided their pain management abilities:\n\u2018The programme of exercise and particularly relaxation has helped considerably. To such an\nextent I reduced my medication and then I\u2019ve stopped it.\u2019 (LBP)\n\u2018I\u2019ve changed my lifestyle, the way I eat, drink. I used to go at the weekend, five pints, no\nproblem.\u2019 (CR)\n\u2018I\u2019ve Angina and I just wanted to keep myself fit . . . Yes it\u2019s delivering yes. Being in a group like\nthis makes you do the exercise that you wouldn\u2019t do at home.\u2019 (GPR)\nAlthough changes in lifestyle-behaviours are not examples of direct health benefits\nin themselves, but rather strategies to help promote health, many of the participants who\nreported changing their lifestyle-behaviours as a result of participating in the interventions\nfelt that they were already experiencing benefits, such as improved feelings of fitness and\nmobility.\nWe l l b e i n g\n\u2018Wellbeing\u2019 is a widely used, if somewhat vague, concept, but it is helpful in capturing\nthe extensive range of data relating to psychosocial issues uncovered in this research.\nWe employ it here to refer to psychosocial outcomes, such as increased confidence\nand self-esteem, or accounts of increased opportunities for social interaction. As well as\nbeing linked to some of the physical health issues described in the above section, all of\nthese factors are known to impact on an individual\u2019s \u2018job readiness\u2019, which is defined\nas being ready \u2018physically, mentally or emotionally to sustain paid employment\u2019 (Dean,\n2003: 455). Thematic analyses reveal that participants reported experiencing psychosocial\nbenefits as a result of their involvement in the projects more frequently than any other\nkind of benefit. The most commonly cited effect was a sense of increased self-confidence\n(see Table 2).\nThe issue of increased confidence did not appear to be noticeably gendered. Indeed,\nthis theme was expressed in different guises by participants from all of the intervention\ntypes, but it was most notable amongst participants in the vocational advice and\nsupport programmes. These findings support the conclusions of a recent study of women\nencountering multiple barriers to employment (Heggie et al., 2007), where the related\nissues of increased confidence, self-esteem and employment aspirations were shown to\nbe central to the outcomes of a personal development programme.\nAs Table 2 demonstrates, however, not all impacts on confidence and empowerment\nwere positive. For example, participants in the Placing People First highlighted that the\nconfidence gained through employability initiatives had the potential to work as a \u2018double-\nedged sword\u2019 (see Table 2). So, while there was a consensus that the interventions did\nindeed boost self-confidence and reaffirm self-belief, there was also a concern amongst\nindividuals that, if they were subsequently unable to secure long-term paid employment,\nor achieve other ambitions nurtured by the intervention, that when the programme ended,\ntheir confidence could potentially dip further. This underlines the fact that participants\n343\nJoyce, K. E. et al.\nTable 2 Positive and negative aspects of confidence\nImpact on\nconfidence Sub-theme Illustrative quotation\nPositive Self-esteem \u2018. . .it\u2019s just getting that experience and making you\nfeel a little bit better about yourself as well.\u2019 (PPF)\nSense of\npride\/Satisfaction\n\u2018Do you know we were the first dads in the North\nEast to do childcare?. . .

Consequently, some participants stressed that projects which\naddressed these issues without also addressing some of the other barriers they faced, had\nthe potential to leave them feeling apathetic, frustrated and with lower self-worth than\nwhen they began the intervention.\nOne psychosocial impact talked about in consistently positive terms was the\nenhanced opportunities for social interaction that participation in many of the\nemployability projects appeared to bring. As illustrated in Table 3, some participants\nfelt they had benefited from being able to share their problems with people experiencing\nsimilar difficulties. By building up relationships and support networks, participants from\nmany of the interventions (particularly those interventions involving regular meetings)\nreported that participation had helped to reduce feelings of isolation.

Again, this was an effect\nthat was always talked about in positive terms. It was often related to the ability to provide\nadvice to others, or exchange information, but participants in some of the projects also\nfelt that the interventions had helped to break down social barriers between communities\nand had, therefore, helped to promote a broader kind of social inclusion (see Table 3).\nOn a more practical level, several participants (notably those participating in Positive\nSteps) regarded their experiences as a means of giving structure and \u2018meaning\u2019 to their\nday. In other words, the void left by the absence of employment is filled with participation\non an employability programme (a finding which echoes Baines and Hardill\u2019s (2008)\nrecent account of volunteering by participants in communities beset by worklessness).\nThe following section moves on to focus more directly on the issue of employability and\nattachment to the labour market.\nEmployment\nThe data relating to employment are grouped into two key areas: perceived barriers to\nemployment and employability, each of which is discussed in turn.\nPe rce i ved ba r r i e r s to e mp loymen t\nThe most frequently cited barriers to employment were psychosocial in nature and\nincluded low confidence and limited self\u2013esteem (see Table 4). It is these kinds of\npsychosocial barriers which the above data suggests many of the projects were successful\nin beginning to address. Importantly, however, structural factors were also frequently\n345\nJoyce, K. E. et al.\nTable 4 Barriers to employment\nTheme Illustrative quotations\nHealth \u2018I can\u2019t be doing it.

For example,\nseveral participants, who each participated in different types of intervention, reported\nbeing restricted by the poor reliability and\/or high expense of transport services in their\narea. These concerns were especially pertinent for those individuals living in rural areas,\naway from larger towns with more regular bus services.\nAccounts of the difficulties in accessing appropriate (in terms of matching individuals\u2019\nskills) and desirable or meaningful (in terms of both the salary and the stimulation\nprovided) jobs were widespread amongst the participants who were actively searching\nfor employment at the time of the research. Moreover, a strong feeling was expressed\nby participants in many of the interventions that the availability of jobs was extremely\nlimited, especially away from the main economic centres. Where jobs were available,\nthey often failed to offer participants the quality and security that they were looking for\n(see Table 4).\nThe extracts in Table 4 align with a considerable body of evidence which suggests that\ndespite central government\u2019s continued focus on supply-side issues and work activation\npolicies, there remain large disparities across the country in terms of employment\nopportunities (Turok and Webster, 1998; Peck, 1999; Martin et al., 2003; Beatty and\nFothergill, 2005; Theodore 2007). For example, Theodore (2007) focuses on the North\u2013\nSouth divide, with areas of the North accounting for over 75 per cent of the jobs deficit, and\ndraws attention to particular gaps in the bottom quarter of the labour market. Likewise,\nTurok and Webster (1998) highlight how the uneven geography of unemployment in\nthe UK is likely to have a significant influence on the effectiveness of employability\ninitiatives such as the New Deal. As the final quotation in Table 4 illustrates, the absence\nof adequately paid, secure and permanent jobs can result in individuals taking up\nunsatisfactory employment, which has the potential to be detrimental to their health\nand wellbeing. A cross-sectional study (Broom et al., 2006) showed that low-quality jobs,\ncharacterised by high strain and low security and marketability, were associated with\npoor mental and physical health effects, which were comparable to those reported by\nthe unemployed. This issue should not be ignored by interventions that aim to tackle\n346\nMost of industry\u2019s shutting down up here. . .\nworklessness effectively, particularly those which construct employment as a route to\nbetter health, for it raises questions about whether having a job with high psychosocial\nstressors is necessarily better than being unemployed.\nEmp loyab i l i t y\nDue to the varied nature of the interventions appraised and the range of individuals\nwho participated, it is no surprise that differences in employability outcomes (defined\nas movement into work, return from\/avoid probable sickness absence, movement into\neducation\/training or increased work-related aspirations) were observed for the 13\ndifferent projects. Feedback from the health-related programmes showed that several\nof the participants had successfully retained employment, or had returned to employment\nafter a period of sickness absence, following their participation in the intervention.\nIn contrast, participants in the education\/training, work placement\/volunteering and\nvocational advice\/support programmes had usually entered the projects due to their lack\nof employment. Although, fewer of the participants in these types of projects were in\nsecure employment at the time of the focus groups, many reported that the intervention\nhad been effective in increasing their work-relevant skills, experience and\/or aspirations,\nand at least two people recounted that they had secured full-time, permanent employment\nas a result of participation in these projects:\n\u2018Well they\u2019ve already said, when the six months is up, they\u2019ll keep us as long as I go to college.\u2019\n(PPF)\n\u2018I started off volunteering and that has led to a job . . . that\u2019s directly led to a job, so that\u2019s a\nsuccess.\u2019 (V)\nPerhaps the relative success of the work placement\/volunteering interventions was related\nto the \u2018job readiness\u2019 of these participants compared with those individuals who had\njoined the education\/training or vocational advice\/support programmes in order to\ndevelop skills or confidence in relation to the labour market.\nThere was less evidence of successful employment outcomes for participants in\nthe vocational advice\/support projects and the education\/training project. Reasons for\nthese differences are likely to be related to the complexity of barriers experienced by\nindividuals participating in these interventions. In many cases, participants reported a\nplethora of barriers impeding their movement into the labour market, such as chronic\nhealth conditions, lacking work-relevant skills and experience, low self-confidence and\nissues relating to being a full-time carer. This again highlights how simple short-term linear\ninterventions are unlikely to help individuals with complex needs.\nPerce ived prob lems wi th the in te rven t ions\nFor the most part, research participants were extremely supportive of the interventions they\nhad been involved in. It is perhaps partly as a consequence of this that there was a recurring\nconcern about the short-term nature of many of the projects. As the quotations below\n347\nJoyce, K. E. et al.\nillustrate, participants from all intervention types were keen to express their concerns\nabout the need for project continuity and the maintenance of funding:\n\u2018When the funding runs out all the good work comes to an end, and you\u2019ve maybe built people\u2019s\nconfidence and capacity and then they\u2019re left with nothing, and that is maybe leaving them in\na worse state than they were before the funding was actually there.\u2019 (V)\n\u2018They do it with everywhere you know, they give subsidies but they expect places to be self\nsufficient after a certain amount of time, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening though. I know there\u2019s\npetitions and . . .\u2019 (PS)\n\u2018Like I say I\u2019d hate to think they stop doing them you know because then we\u2019re just going back\nto square one.\u2019 (SIW)\nThe short duration of projects was a real concern to participants with many feeling\nthat such a myopic stance could limit the potential success of the interventions and\npossibly unravel the progress they had already made. In particular, participants voiced\nthe need for consideration to be given to the support mechanisms available to participants\nonce projects have ended.\nDiscuss ion\nThe interventions considered here set out to tackle the complex issue of worklessness\nby drawing on a multifaceted approach, which included projects focusing on physical,\npsychological and social determinants. Overall, this strategy appears to have achieved\nsome successes: health-related projects were reported to have helped participants tackle\nmental and physical ill health problems, while education\/training interventions and\nvolunteering\/work placement schemes appeared to have supported participants in dealing\nwith more practical barriers, such as lack of work skills and experience. It should be\nemphasised here that these patterns were not rigid, and different types of interventions\nwere felt by participants to have multiple, inter-related benefits (see Figure 1). A number\nof participants reported that the intervention had helped them return from, or avoid\nprobable, absences from work as a result of poor health. Of those participants who were\nout of work, several suggested that their attachment to the labour market had increased,\nparticularly those participants in the volunteering\/work placement interventions who\ncould also, perhaps, be described as more \u2018job ready\u2019. All of this suggests the programme\nof interventions being studied in County Durham was relatively successful. However, this\n\u2018success\u2019 story is accompanied by some important caveats, from which lessons can (and,\nwe argue, should) be learnt, as the following sections explore.\nNeed fo r i nd i v i dua l i s ed suppo r t\nAs Stafford et al. (2008) argue, those individuals with more financial and human capital are\nlikely to be at an advantage in terms of accessing information, using services and feeding\nback on their experiences relating to the labour market. There is a need, therefore, to\nequalise the routes into employability interventions and, perhaps more importantly, to\nprovide tailored support for individuals facing multiple barriers to employment. Indeed,\n348\nMost of industry\u2019s shutting down up here. . .\nArksey (2003) suggests that a pilot employment project (People into Employment \u2013\nPIE) implemented in the north-east of England achieved success due to the highly\nindividualised support it provided, which was characterised by one-to-one support, tailor-\nmade job searching and training, flexibility in responding to different needs and related\nadjustments in expectations with regards to the pace of the return to work journey.\nSimilarly, Lindsay et al. (2008) contest that it is not enough for policymakers simply to\nacknowledge the complex and multifaceted barriers faced by job seekers, rather there is an\nimpetus to commit to flexible and innovative approaches promoting employability which,\nthey argue, are hallmarked by cooperation and mutualism in both design and delivery. We\ntherefore endorse the adaptive and multi-faceted approach to worklessness advocated by\nDean (2003), who argues that a \u2018life-first\u2019 model of welfare to work should be encouraged\nin future initiatives. This could conceivably incorporate projects that support individuals\nin maintaining employment (e.g. health-related programmes), alongside those that aim\nto overcome skills and psychosocial barriers to work. The emphasis, as Dean (2003)\nmaintains, should be placed on the individual and their life needs so that employability\ninitiatives are adaptive and, crucially, responsive to the varying requirements of all\nparticipants involved.\nSho r t - t e r m focus\nMany of the interventions discussed in this study involved individuals facing multiple inter-\nrelated barriers to employment and, whilst the interventions appeared to have helped most\nof these individuals to make some progress on a journey towards employment, it is likely\nthat ongoing support is necessary. Indeed, participants on many of the programmes high-\nlighted the short duration of the projects as a key concern and potential barrier to success.\nIt is clear that short-term employability projects do not usually have the scope and\nresources to deliver appropriate support to individuals facing some of the multiple and\ncomplex problems described here (Dean, 2003; Lindsay et al., 2007). Furthermore, it has\npreviously been noted from the perspective of those involved in implementing local inter-\nventions that the short-term nature of some projects can be damaging to those involved:\nOnce people\u2019s energies and hopes have been engaged there is a danger of achieving less than\nnothing if the support cannot be sustained, as they are likely to become disillusioned and\ncynical about any opportunities that might be offered in the future. (Matka et al., 2002: 103)\nThe above extract focuses on the comments of a project organiser, but the data presented\nin this paper suggest that participants in short-term interventions often share such a\nperception. Although these concerns are not new, they further underline the need for\npolicymakers (and researchers) to consider more carefully the long-term impacts of short-\nterm projects.\nN e e d f o r de m a n d - s i d e i n t e r v e n t i o n s\nLike many employability projects in the UK, each of the 13 interventions focussed\non the supply side of the labour market in providing training, advice and support\nand paid scant, if any, attention to demand-side factors (Beatty and Fothergill, 2005;\nDevins and Hogarth, 2005; Bambra, 2006; Grover, 2007). This is particularly important\n349\nJoyce, K. E. et al.\ngiven that participants reported facing persistent structural barriers to employment,\nsuch as a low availability of accessible, high-quality, suitable employment or training\nopportunities. These observations parallel several commentators\u2019 assertions that policy\ninitiatives continue to conceptualise worklessness as a labour supply problem despite\nconvincing evidence to the contrary, especially in (former) industrial areas (Turok and\nWebster, 1998; Martin et al., 2003; Beatty and Fothergill, 2005). For example, Martin\net al. (2003: 203) argue that the need to integrate active labour market policies with mea-\nsures to stimulate labour demand is often \u2018overlooked by an orthodoxy which separates a\nnotion of equality of opportunity from the geographical conditions and disparities which\nstructure its realisation\u2019. In the context of the delivery of the New Deal programme, they\nargue that an overly simplistic focus on either the demand or supply side of the problem\nin isolation is insufficient and a closer understanding of small-scale contextual factors is\nnecessary to build success in depressed regional and local labour markets.\nThe need to address demand-side issues is also highlighted by an increasing\nrecognition that not all forms of employment are beneficial to health and wellbeing\n(Waddell and Burton, 2006). For example, Bartley et al. (2006) draws attention to the\nincrease of low-skilled service sector jobs which offer little security and can incur similar\ncosts to mental wellbeing and physical health as unemployment. In addressing demand-\nside issues, there is clearly a need, therefore, to consider the quality of employment\nopportunities, as well as the quantity. Although arguments around the neglect of structural\nbarriers in employment initiatives have been well rehearsed (e.g. Beatty and Fothergill,\n2005; Devins and Hogarth, 2005; Grover, 2007), this study provides empirical evidence to\nshow that these challenges have not yet been responded to by policymakers. It should be\nnoted that this paper focuses exclusively on the perceptions and experiences of individuals\nwho participated in employability schemes and does not attempt to deal with employers\u2019\nviews or assess supply-side issues (issues which have not been significantly examined in\nrelation to recent employability schemes in the UK and which warrant further research).\nWhilst it could be argued, from a policy perspective, that it is unlikely that everyone\nwith diverse and complex needs can secure a meaningful and rewarding employment, in\ndesigning future welfare to work interventions it is nevertheless crucial to consider how\nindividuals perceive their needs and desires in relation to work.\nConc lus ion\nIn summary, this paper demonstrates some of the benefits of participation in employability\nprojects, such as positive effects on lifestyle-behavioural factors and wellbeing, whilst also\ndrawing attention to participants\u2019 concerns regarding the short-term nature of projects\nand the possible negative consequences associated with projects that focus on increasing\nindividuals\u2019 sense of empowerment in environments offering few meaningful employment\nopportunities. While the programme of interventions appears to have helped address some\nof the barriers to employment cited by participants (such as low self-confidence and\nlimited skills\/experience), structural barriers continue to persist, most notably a paucity\nof accessible and desirable jobs, and there is little evidence to suggest policymakers are\neffectively addressing these more daunting barriers. Nevertheless, given that movement\nback into employment is likely to be characterised by a series of small but important\nsteps, rather than one straightforward, linear pathway into work (Hoggart et al., 2006),\nthe perceived benefits of participation in the employability programmes should not be\nundermined.\n350\nMost of industry\u2019s shutting down up here. . .\nThe findings also suggest that the synergy between various interventions could\npotentially be exploited further in subsequent employability initiatives, by incorporating\nshort-term projects into longer-term strategies and by strengthening the links between\nprojects. Finally, it needs to be acknowledged that the data drawn upon in this study only\nprovide a short-term insight into the participants\u2019 experiences of the interventions, as they\nwere collected from individuals who were either still involved, or who had only recently\ncompleted participation. Future research might consider how individuals\u2019 experiences\nand perceived barriers to the labour market change over time by adopting life history or\nbiographical type methods (see for example Holland et al., 2006 or Corden and Nice,\n2007).\nAuthorsh ip cont r ibu t ion s ta tement\nKerry Joyce undertook data collection and analysis and was lead author of the paper.\nKatherine Smith undertook data collection and analysis and contributed to writing-up.\nClaire Sullivan contributed to writing up.
