INTRODUCTION \n 2\n Fuzzy control approach offers a powerful and systematical control methodology \nto handle nonlinear systems.  Due to the superior approximation and reasoning abilities of \nthe fuzzy controller, fuzzy control approach has been applied in different applications.  \nOne of the most common issues of the fuzzy control systems is the system stability which \nhas drawn the attention of researchers for many years.  In the early stage, the fuzzy \ncontrollers have been designed heuristically.  However, the fuzzy controllers designed \nbased on the heuristic techniques come with no guarantee on the system stability.  With \nthe extensive efforts of the researchers working on the fuzzy control discipline, fruitful \nstability analysis results have been obtained to aid the design of stable fuzzy controllers. \n The most popular method to study the stability of the fuzzy control systems is the \nLyapunov-based approach.  In [1]-[2], a T-S fuzzy model was employed to represent the \nsystem dynamics of the nonlinear system.  The T-S fuzzy model represents the nonlinear \nsystem as a weighted sum of some linear sub-systems.  This particular structure offers a \ngeneral framework to represent the nonlinear system which is favourable for system \nanalysis.  A fuzzy controller [3]-[4] was proposed to handle the nonlinear system \nrepresented the fuzzy model.  The fuzzy control system is guaranteed to be \nasymptotically stable if there exists a solution to a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) \n[5] which can be solved efficiently and numerically using some convex programming \ntechniques.  In [4], a parallel distributed compensation (PDC) design approach was \nproposed to design the feedback gains of the fuzzy controllers.  It was proposed in [4], [6] \nthat the fuzzy controller shares the same premises as those of the fuzzy model.  Under \nsuch a design criterion, it was reported in [6] that relaxed stability conditions can be \nobtained.  Further relaxed stability results were reported in [7]-[11]. \n 3\n In most of the work on the stability analysis of fuzzy control systems, both \ncontinuous-time and discrete-time fuzzy control system have been studied.  However, \nfuzzy controllers with sampled-data control rules are seldom concerned.  The sampled-\ndata control rules can be easily implemented by some microcontrollers or digital \ncomputers to lower the implementation cost and time.  However, the system dynamics of \nthe closed-loop system will become more complex due to the sampling activity \nintroducing discontinuity to the system which increases the analysis difficulty.  As a \nresult, the stability analysis approach proposed in pure continuous-time or discrete-time \nfuzzy controller system cannot be applied.  In [12], the sampled-data fuzzy control \nsystem was represented by an equivalent jump system.  In this approach, the system is \nseparated to continuous and dis-continuous parts.  The system stability is implied by the \nstabilities of both parts.  In [13], the system stability of a linear sampled-data control \nsystem was analyzed.  By representing the sampling time as a time-varying delay, \nstability conditions were derived using Lyapunov-based approach.  However when \nnonlinear systems are considered, the system analysis will become more complicated.  In \n[14], we have extended the approach for linear system in [13] to time-delay sampled-data \nfuzzy control systems.  As the membership functions depending on the sampled system \nstates, which leads to the favourable property relaxing the stability conditions, vanishes, a \nconservative stability analysis result were obtained.  Furthermore, it leads to a more \nnumber of stability conditions. \n In this paper, fuzzy controller with sampled-data control rules is proposed to \nhandle the nonlinear plant represented by a fuzzy model.  In the proposed fuzzy \ncontroller, it shares the same membership functions as those of the fuzzy model to relax \n 4\nthe stability conditions.  In the consequent part, the fuzzy controller employs sampled-\ndata linear sub-controllers.  The sampled-data linear sub-controller is formed by a \nsampler with sampling period h, a discrete-time linear controller and a zero-order-hold \n(ZOH) unit.  In this paper, the system stability of this kind of fuzzy control system is \ninvestigated using Lyapunov-based approach.  LMI-stability conditions are derived to \nguarantee the system stability.  In order to guarantee the system performance, LMI-based \nperformance conditions are derived as well.  The stability and performance conditions \nwill serve as a mathematical tool to aid the design of a stable and well-performed fuzzy \ncontroller for nonlinear system. \n This paper is organized as follows.  In section II, the fuzzy model and the fuzzy \ncontroller with sampled-data control rules are presented.  In section III, the LMI-based \nstability and performance conditions of the fuzzy control systems are derived.  In section \nIV, an application example is presented to illustrate the design procedure and the merits \nof the proposed approach.  A conclusion is drawn in section V. \n \nII.  FUZZY MODEL AND FUZZY CONTROLLER WITH SAMPLED-DATA CONTROL RULES \n A fuzzy control system, formed by a nonlinear plant represented by a fuzzy model \nand a fuzzy controller with sampled-data control rules, is considered. \n \nA.

Fuzzy Controller with Sampled-Data Control Rules \n A p-rule fuzzy controller is designed based on the fuzzy model of the nonlinear \nplant.  The j-th rule of the fuzzy controller is of the following format: \nRule j: IF ))((1 tf x  is \nj\n1M  AND \u2026 AND ))(( tf x\u03a8  is j\u03a8M  \n           THEN )()( \u03b3tt j xGu = , t B\u03b3 B < t \u2264 tB\u03b3+1 B (5) \nwhere G j\nm n\u2208\u211c \u00d7  is  the feedback gain of rule j to be designed.  tB\u03b3 B = \u03b3h, \u03b3 = 0, 1, 2, ..., \u221e; \ndenotes a time instant; h = tB\u03b3+1B \u2212 tB\u03b3 B denotes the constant sampling period.

STABILITY ANALYSIS AND PERFORMANCE DESIGN \n In this section, the system stability of the fuzzy control system formed by (2) and \n(7) is investigated based on the Lyapunov-based approach.  Stability conditions are \nderived to guarantee the system stability.  Based on the stability conditions, the feedback \ngains GBj B, j = 1, 2, ..., p, can be determined to achieve the system stability.  LMI-based \nperformance conditions will be derived to serve as design constraints for the feedback \ngains to achieve the system performance. \n \nA.  Stability Analysis \n The system stability of the fuzzy control system is investigated.  In the following \nanalysis, wBi B(x(t)) is denoted by wBi B for short.  Furthermore, the equality of \u2211p\ni=\niw\n1\n = \n\u2211\u2211\n=\np\ni=\np\nj\njiww\n1 1\n = 1 is used.

The fuzzy controller with \n\u23a5\u23a5\n\u23a5\u23a5\n\u23a6\n\u23a4\n\u23a2\u23a2\n\u23a2\u23a2\n\u23a3\n\u23a1\n=\n1000\n010000\n0010\n0001\n1J , which \nplaces heavier weight on xB3 B(t), offers better system responses in terms of faster settling \ntime for x B3 B(t).  Referring to this figure, it can be seen that the control signals are \ncontinuous during the sampling period due to the grade of the membership is continuous \nchanging and there is a jump at the sampling instant in which the control signals of the \nsampled-data linear sub-controllers change.  In this example, the proposed LMI-based \nstability and performance conditions offer a systematic tool to help achieve a stable and \nwell-performed fuzzy controller with sampled-data sub-control rules. \n \nV.  CONCLUSION \n 18\n The stability of the fuzzy control system formed by a nonlinear plant and a fuzzy \ncontroller with sampled-data sub-control rules has been investigated.  Stability conditions \nin terms of linear matrix inequalities have been derived based on Lyapunov-based \napproach.  LMI-based performance conditions have been derived to guarantee the system \nperformance.  With the LMI-based stability and performance conditions, a stable and \nwell-performed fuzzy controller with sampled-data sub-control rules can be designed for \na nonlinear system.  An application example has been given to illustrate the effectiveness \nof the proposed approach. \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \n The work described in this paper was supported by the Division of Engineering, \nKing\u2019s College London. \n \nREFERENCES \n1 Takagi T. and Sugeno M.: \u2018Fuzzy identification of systems and its applications to \nmodeling and control\u2019 IEEE Trans.
