INTRODUCTION\nThe study of nanometer-sized semiconductors is an ac-\ntive field of research because of applications in advanced\nelectronic and optoelectronic devices and photovoltaic cells.\nThe major advantage of using nanometer-sized semiconduc-\ntors is that their optical and electrical properties can be tai-\nlored simply by size alteration without changing the chemi-\ncal composition of the materials. Si is dominant in\nmicroelectronics but, as an indirect-bandgap semiconductor,\nit is not an efficient light emitter. This causes a serious prob-\nlem of optoelectronic integration that, however, may be\nsolved when the dimension of Si is reduced to the\nnanometer-sized regime. Recently, optical gain has been\nachieved in nanocrystalline Si ~nc-Si!,1,2 opening a route to\nthe fabrication of a Si laser on a microelectronic chip. While\nit is generally accepted that the bandgap of Si widens as a\nresult of quantum confinement, which causes the blueshift of\nphotoluminescence ~PL! for Si crystallite size below 5 nm,3\nit is also believed that the interface between nc-Si and SiO2\nplays a role in the radiative emission of nc-Si, especially\nwhen its size is smaller than 3 nm.4 Therefore, it is desirable\nto pay close attention to the interfaces associated with nc-Si.\nPositron annihilation spectroscopy ~PAS! with a slow\npositron beam has demonstrated its power in the investiga-\ntion of the interface between SiO2 and Si substrates.5,6 It is\nknown that positrons can be easily trapped at open-volume\ndefects as a result of the missing positive-ion cores at these\ndefects. This trapping usually gives rise to a narrowing of the\nannihilation gamma energy spectrum ~centered at 511 keV!\ncompared with that for positron annihilation in defect-free\nsites. This narrowing is characterized by an increase in the\nparameter S, defined as the central fraction of the annihila-\ntion spectrum.7 However, S is also sensitive to impurities\nsuch as hydrogen,8\u201311 oxygen,12,13 fluorine,14,15 and\nnitrogen;6 when they decorate the open-volume defects in\nsemiconductors, a decrease in measured S values is generally\nobserved. In this work, PAS and PL are employed to study\nthe interface between nc-Si and SiO2 . Changes of the inter-\nface region during the agglomeration of nc-Si in SiO2 in\ndifferent atmospheres are elucidated.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE\nSi ions of 150 keV were implanted to a dose of\n1.631017 cm22 into a 500-nm-thick layer of SiO2 thermally\ngrown in dry oxygen on ~100! Czochralski Si ~p-type, 10\nV cm!. The sample was then annealed at 1100 \u00b0C for 1 h in\nnitrogen to produce nc-Si dispersed in SiO2 . The nanocrys-\ntals are ;3 nm in diameter on average, with a concentration\nof 231019 cm23 in a region centered at a depth of ;200 nm\nfrom the SiO2 surface. The PL spectrum of the as-formed\nnanocrystals has a peak at 800 nm, demonstrating the simi-\nlarity of the present nanocrystals to those in Ref. 1. Further\nannealing of this sample was carried out between 400 and\n900 \u00b0C for 30 min in nitrogen, oxygen, and vacuum. In the\nformer two, a furnace with flowing gas was used, and in thea!Electronic mail: p.g.coleman@bath.ac.uk\nJOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS VOLUME 95, NUMBER 12 15 JUNE 2004\n81550021-8979\/2004\/95(12)\/8155\/5\/$22.00 \u00a9 2004 American Institute of Physics\nDownloaded 31 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132.

Beam-based PAS16 and PL were used to measure\nthese annealed samples. Depth-sensitive PAS was performed\nby implanting positrons with controllable energies in the\nrange 0.5\u201330 keV, corresponding to mean depths from 6 nm\nto 4 mm. PL measurements were made at room temperature\nusing a photomultiplier detector; excitation was via the 514\nnm line of an argon laser at a power ;100 mW and a beam\ndiameter ;0.5 mm. The luminescence was measured with a\nSpex spectrometer with a slit width of 600 mm in the range\n580\u2013910 nm. Experimental conditions such as laser power\nand orientation with respect to the laser beam and spectrom-\neter were kept constant as far as possible. A correction was\nnecessary to account for the wavelength-dependent response\nof the system. This was done by measuring spectra of a\nconstant-power tungsten lamp and comparing the measured\nspectra with its calculated spectra.17 The apparent tempera-\nture of the tungsten lamp was measured using a pyrometer\nwith a red filter.\nIII. RESULTS\nA. Annealing in nitrogen\nFigures 1~a! and 1~b! show the change of the PL spectra\nfrom these nanocrystals after annealing at 700 and 900 \u00b0C in\nnitrogen, respectively. The PL spectrum of the sample after\n400 \u00b0C annealing is essentially the same as that of the as-\nformed sample, and thus is not shown. After 700 \u00b0C anneal-\ning, the position of the PL peak remains the same, but the\nshort-wavelength side becomes wider. A small redshift is ob-\nserved after 900 \u00b0C annealing. It is assumed that the lumi-\nnescence from the as-formed sample derives from both quan-\ntum confinement and interface state radiation because the\nsizes of nanocrystals are not uniform and their average size\n~3 nm! is on the boundary between the two mechanisms.4\nPAS results for the samples annealed in nitrogen are\nshown in Fig. 2. The S curves for the virgin SiO2 \/Si and\nhigh-temperature annealed SiO2 \/Si ~1100 \u00b0C, N2) are also\nincluded for comparison. All the S values presented here\nhave been normalized with respect to that for the defect-free\nSi bulk. The interface between SiO2 and Si substrate is indi-\ncated by a dip at ;7 keV in the S curve for the virgin\nSiO2 \/Si, which corresponds to a mean depth of ;400 nm.\nThe dip can be explained by the residual hydrogen at the\ninterface region.18 Here, the apparent position of the inter-\nface is slightly shallower than the expected 500 nm because\nof the smearing caused by the broad annihilation profile and\npositron diffusion effects.5 It is seen that S values ~from now\non S values refer to those for the SiO2 layer if not stated! for\nthe as-formed sample are significantly smaller than those for\nthe annealed virgin sample ~1100 \u00b0C, N2). After the sample\nis annealed at 400 \u00b0C, S values decrease, and then remain\nunchanged after annealing at 550 ~not shown! and 700 \u00b0C.\nFrom 800 \u00b0C ~not shown!, S values begin to recover, becom-\ning even larger than those for the as-formed sample after\n900 \u00b0C annealing.\nB. Annealing in oxygen\nFigure 3 shows the PAS results for the samples annealed\nin oxygen. As in nitrogen, S values decrease after 400 \u00b0C\nannealing. With temperature, they continue to fall until a\nminimum is met at 700 \u00b0C. As in nitrogen, S values then rise\nfrom 800 \u00b0C and, after annealing at 900 \u00b0C they become\nnearly the same as those for the as-formed sample.\nAfter annealing in oxygen at 400 \u00b0C, the PL spectrum\nshows no change, as in nitrogen. However, the clear PL red-\nshifts for the samples annealed at 700 and 900 \u00b0C in oxygen\nare illustrated in Fig. 1~c!.\nFIG. 1.

Annealing in vacuum\nThe PAS results for the samples annealed in vacuum are\nshown in Fig. 4. After 400 \u00b0C annealing, S values do not\nchange in the SiO2 layer. The S values for the region around\nSiO2\/substrate ~500 nm mean depth! are, however, reduced\nsignificantly. When the temperature is increased to 500 \u00b0C,\nthese values become slightly smaller than those for the as-\nformed sample, and the change in S for the SiO2 layer is still\nnegligible. The data for the annealing at 700 \u00b0C are similar to\nthose for the as-formed sample, and are not shown. The\nchange in the SiO2\/substrate region during the present an-\nnealing is consistent with a model of the decoration of inter-\nface defects by hydrogen.9 No change in the SiO2 layer in-\ndicates that the decoration of the defects at the nc-Si\/SiO2\ninterface is negligible. This implies that hydrogen mainly\nenters the normal SiO2 structure during the high-temperature\nformation process of nc-Si ~see Sec. IV!. In addition, we find\nthat S values for both SiO2 layer and SiO2\/substrate decrease\nif the sample is washed with acetone shortly before 400 \u00b0C\nannealing in vacuum.\nNo change in PL after 400 \u00b0C annealing in vacuum is\nobserved. However, the additional acetone washing induces a\nsmall redshift of the PL peak, illustrated in Fig. 1~d!. Also\nshown is the clear redshift after 700 \u00b0C annealing in vacuum\n@Fig. 1~e!#.\nIV. DISCUSSION\nAccording to the work of Brauer et al.,19 it is certain that\nthe annealing in this work does not change the structure of\nvirgin SiO2 . As mentioned in Sec. III C, there is a high\nconcentration of residual hydrogen in the SiO2 \/Si interface\nregion although the sample is grown in a dry oxygen\natmosphere.18 During post-growth annealing, hydrogen dif-\nfuses towards the surface of SiO2 so that it is nearly uni-\nformly distributed in the SiO2 layer.18 Because hydrogen in-\ntroduces low S values in SiO2 by reducing the positronium\nformation probability,20,21 we see a clear decrease in S after\nthe virgin SiO2 \/Si sample is annealed at 1100 \u00b0C in nitrogen\n~Figs. 2\u20134!.\nWhen nc-Si is formed in SiO2 after the same annealing,\nthe S values are further reduced ~Figs. 2\u20134!. This is not due\nto the implantation-induced defects, which can be annealed\nout at 600 \u00b0C.22 The Si nanocrystals themselves cannot ac-\ncount for this decrease, either. The diffusion length of posi-\ntrons in defect-free Si is usually 215\u2013250 nm,23 which is\nsignificantly larger than the sizes of nc-Si in our sample.\nMoreover, it is known that many interfaces are normally in-\ntroduced between the SiO2 matrix and nc-Si. The mismatch\nbetween them leaves open-volume spaces ~voids! in the in-\nterface regions. They naturally have a better ability to trap\npositrons than both the normal SiO2 structure and Si, inhib-\niting the quantum confinement of positrons in nc-Si no mat-\nter how different their positron affinities are.24 Hence, the\nprobability of positron annihilation inside nc-Si is\nFIG. 2.

The presence of nitrogen in a system of Si\nclusters embedded in SiO2 has been identified by x-ray pho-\ntoelectron spectroscopy.26 There is also the possibility that\nsome oxygen atoms could decorate the interfacial voids,\nsimilarly lowering the S parameter. We should be also aware\nof the implantation-induced volume compaction in the struc-\nture of SiO2 . This leads to the suppression of the formation\nof positronium, also contributing to the decrease of S.22 After\n400 \u00b0C annealing in nitrogen, the trapping of nitrogen in the\ninterface regions is saturated. This explains why S values\ndecrease and then hardly change until 700 \u00b0C ~Fig. 2!.\nAs in nitrogen, 400 \u00b0C annealing in oxygen introduces\noxygen into the voids around nc-Si. This causes the decrease\nof S ~Fig. 3!, which continues until 700 \u00b0C. In contrast,\n400 \u00b0C annealing in vacuum introduces no impurities. The\nsubstantial decrease in the value of S suggests that the de-\nfects at the nc-Si\/SiO2 interface have already been decorated\nby nitrogen from the atmosphere or\/and oxygen from the\nimplantation-induced oxygen interstitials during the forma-\ntion of nc-Si. It is supposed that the voids around nc-Si do\nnot then trap hydrogen, but instead provide excellent diffu-\nsion channels. Consequently, whereas hydrogen in the nor-\nmal SiO2 structure is not trapped in the nc-Si\/SiO2 interface\nregions during 400 \u00b0C annealing in vacuum, it can diffuse to\nthe SiO2\/substrate interface and is trapped by the interface\ndefects there. The change of hydrogen concentration in the\nSiO2 layer is small so that S values remain nearly the same\nas the as-formed sample ~Fig. 4!. The concentration of hy-\ndrogen in the SiO2\/substrate interface, however, is consider-\nably increased because of its relatively small width ~1\u20132 nm!\n8 compared with that of the SiO2 layer ~500 nm!. Positrons\nare sensitive to the presence of hydrogen in the interface\nregion because of their propensity for localization in that\nregion; this explains the decrease of S around 7 keV ~Fig. 4!.\nIt is proposed that the absence of the decrease in S at around\n7 keV after annealing at 400 \u00b0C in nitrogen or oxygen ~Figs.\n2 and 3! results from the suppression of hydrogen diffusion\nin the SiO2 layer by nitrogen and\/or oxygen blocking its\ndiffusion channels.\nAfter washing the sample with acetone, the residual ac-\netone may dissociate into H, O\u2013H, and CvO during anneal-\ning at 400 \u00b0C in vacuum. It is supposed that H diffuses to the\nSiO2\/substrate interface, inducing a further decrease in S\naround 8 keV ~Fig. 4!. O\u2013H and CvO could enter the nor-\nmal structure of SiO2 or the voids around nc-Si, giving rise\nto the decrease in S for the SiO2 layer. The dip at 8 keV is\ncloser to its \u2018\u2018expected\u2019\u2019 value ~i.e., corresponding to an in-\nterface depth of 500 nm! because it is more pronounced and\nbecause diffusion effects have a weaker smearing effect on\nthe raw data. At temperatures higher than 400 \u00b0C hydrogen\nbecomes mobile and its presence at the interface is no longer\nsignificant enough to be seen in the raw positron data.\nIt is reasonable to assume that the trapping of oxygen in\nthe voids increases with annealing temperature. After anneal-\ning at 700 \u00b0C in oxygen the PL peak is broadened @Fig. 1~c!#.\nThis indicates inhomogeneous oxidation of nc-Si.27 Oxida-\ntion means that additional oxygen is incorporated in addition\nto that in the voids; both contribute to the decrease of S after\n700 \u00b0C annealing ~Fig. 3!.\nThe average size of nc-Si increases after the annealing at\n700 \u00b0C in oxygen, as indicated by the redshift of the PL peak\n@Fig. 1~c!#. The agglomeration of nanocrystals and the vol-\nume increase induced by their oxidation both make smaller\ninterface regions, and thus smaller void volume. This weak-\nens the trapping of oxygen, but its effect on the positron\nmeasurements is not enough to counter the response to the\ntwo factors just discussed.\nAgglomeration during annealing at 700 \u00b0C in nitrogen is\nnegligible, as evidenced by the negligible shift of the PL\npeak @Fig. 1~a!#. The widening of the short-wavelength side\nof the PL peak, however, indicates that more small nanocrys-\ntals are produced. The average distance between nanocrystals\nin the as-formed sample is estimated to be ;0.68 nm. As-\nsuming an activation energy of 1.9 eV and a pre-exponential\nfactor of 1.2931019 cm2 s21 for the diffusion of Si in SiO2\nin a nitrogen atmosphere,28 we find that a Si atom only trav-\nels ;0.18 nm at 700 \u00b0C in 30 min. It is supposed that via the\nOstwald ripening mechanism,29 Si atoms dissociated from\nsmall nanocrystals do not move far enough to reach larger\nones after 700 \u00b0C annealing in nitrogen. This causes a de-\ncrease in the size of small nanocrystals without any growth\nof the neighboring ones. Apparently, the increase of the void\nvolume induced by this process is not significant enough to\nenhance the trapping of nitrogen and to thus reduce S values.\nThe difference in the agglomeration between nitrogen and\noxygen atmospheres implies that the diffusion of Si in SiO2\nis slower in a nitrogen atmosphere.\nWe now turn to the PL results for annealing in vacuum.\nIt is interesting that a small redshift of the PL peak appears\neven at 400 \u00b0C after washing with acetone @Fig. 1~d!#, in\ncontrast to the annealing in nitrogen, oxygen, and vacuum.\nThe unique element introduced by acetone is carbon com-\npared with the others, which all involve the unintentionally\nincorporated hydrogen. Hence, we believe that carbon may\nenhance Si diffusion in SiO2 , resulting in the agglomeration\nof nc-Si at low annealing temperatures. The redshift of the\nPL peak after 700 \u00b0C annealing in vacuum is clearly larger\nthan in nitrogen @Figs. 1~a! and 1~e!#, again implying the\nslow Si diffusion in SiO2 in a nitrogen atmosphere. The un-\nderlying mechanism for these different diffusion phenomena\nneeds further study.\nAbove 700 \u00b0C in nitrogen, Si atoms can move farther so\nthat the agglomeration of nc-Si takes place. This is evidenced\nby the small redshift of the PL peak after the annealing at\n900 \u00b0C in nitrogen @Fig. 1~b!#. As in oxygen, the broadening\nof the PL peak may be due to a nitridation process of nc-Si at\nhigh temperature. Both the size increase and nitridation re-\nduce the interface regions and thus the volume of voids.\nAssuming that the trapping rate of nitrogen in voids is nearly\nthe same as at low temperatures, the resultant decrease in the\namount of nitrogen gives rise to the recovery of S. The re-\nduction of positron trapping in the interface regions is com-\npensated by the increase in the intrinsic open volume of the\nSiO2 matrix. The latter is characterized by high S values\nbecause of the probable formation of positronium.30 After\n8158 J. Appl. Phys., Vol. 95, No. 12, 15 June 2004 Pi et al.\nDownloaded 31 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132. Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/jap\/copyright.jsp\n900 \u00b0C annealing in nitrogen, the fraction of positrons anni-\nhilated in the SiO2 matrix becomes high enough to increase\nmeasured S values to above those for the as-formed sample\n~Fig. 2!.\nOn annealing at high temperature in oxygen, the en-\nhanced Si diffusion in SiO2 results in more effective agglom-\neration of nc-Si. This is illustrated by the considerable red-\nshift of PL peak after 900 \u00b0C annealing in oxygen @Fig. 1~c!#.\nThe more significant size increase, together with the oxida-\ntion process, introduces a larger shrinkage of the interface\nregions and the volume of associated voids than on annealing\nin nitrogen. The resultant decrease of positron trapping in the\ninterface regions should have led to a larger recovery of S;\nhowever, S values just recover to the level for the as-formed\nsample after 900 \u00b0C annealing in oxygen ~Fig. 3!, clearly\nlower than those for the sample annealed at the same tem-\nperature in nitrogen.\nDuring oxidation the oxidized Si can introduce a volume\nincrease by up to 100%, which is ;4 times larger than that\nduring nitridation. We believe that the volume increase of\nnc-Si ~including their oxide shells! during the oxidation at\n900 \u00b0C is so large that the intrinsic open volume of the SiO2\nmatrix shrinks to relax the stress induced by it. This shrink-\nage suppresses the formation of positronium in spite of the\nincrease of the fraction of positrons annihilated in SiO2 as\nhappens in the annealing at 900 \u00b0C in nitrogen, and the in-\ncrease in S is weakened.\nV. SUMMARY\nWe find that nitrogen and oxygen are trapped in the\nvoids around nc-Si at low annealing temperatures. It appears\nthat the defects at the nc-Si\/SiO2 interface have already been\ncompletely passivated by nitrogen and\/or oxygen in the as-\nformed nc-Si sample. High-temperature annealing during the\nformation of nc-Si causes hydrogen to enter the SiO2 struc-\nture, which originally resides in the SiO2\/substrate region.\nHydrogen diffuses back to the SiO2\/substrate region in\nvacuum at 400 \u00b0C because no other impurities block its dif-\nfusion channels. At temperatures above 700 \u00b0C, both nitrogen\nand oxygen react with nc-Si, resulting in a volume increase.\nThis introduces stress in the SiO2 matrix, which is relaxed by\nthe shrinkage of its intrinsic open volume. Moreover, it is\nproposed that nitrogen suppresses Si diffusion in SiO2 , so\nthat the agglomeration of nc-Si is slower during annealing in\nnitrogen than in oxygen or vacuum.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work is supported by EPSRC Grants GR\/M51895\nand GR\/M54001.
