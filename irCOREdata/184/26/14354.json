Edwards and Robert I. Akroyd\nAston Business School, Aston University\nThis paper describes continuing work in using information technology (IT) to help Business\nstudents learn about contract law. The approach adopted uses a model of the contracting process\nas being one of negotiation, where the decisions made by the parties involve the acceptance or\nrejection of certain risks. Normal discussion tutorials are therefore replaced by a role-play\nexercise in which students learn by taking part in simulated negotiations, each interested party\nbeing represented by a team of students. IT is being introduced into the learning process, both to\nprovide decision-support for the student teams, and to improve the mechanics of the exercise.\nIntroduction\nAlmost all business students study law. However, business students have a different\nperspective on law from that of law students. A common problem, therefore, in legal\ncourses for business students is how to provide a sufficiently wide-ranging, practically\nrelevant programme without the sacrifice of intellectual depth. At Aston Business School,\none approach adopted has been to supplement lectures with role-play exercises, rather\nthan conventional tutorials.\nThis paper concentrates on contract law, which also forms a key part of the commercial\nlaw module. The principal exercise, Wheeler-dealer, involves the negotiation of contracts,\nlegal relationships and disputes. It has been in use at Aston for several years, originally in\npaper-based form. Students are divided into two or more teams. Each team is given a\nparticular (real or imaginary) scenario, but is prevented from knowing the full scenario of\nthe opposing team(s). Initially, the teams negotiate a contract or other legal relationship\nand then, when eventually the deal goes wrong, handle the resulting dispute. The role of\nthe tutor is no longer that of teacher, as it would be in a conventional tutorial. Instead it\nis to act as referee of the role-play, to advise on the law, and to play the role(s) of any\npublic officials, such as the judge in court proceedings. A more detailed description may\nbe found in Akroyd and Edwards (1994).\n103\nJohn S. Edwards and Robert I. Akmyd Using information technology to help Business students\nThis paper describes the introduction of information technology (IT) into this learning\nprocess. Other technology has been incorporated from the beginning, parts of the exercise\nbeing video-recorded to enhance the student participants' learning of legal skills.\nIT support for role-play exercises in negotiation\nThere are two ways in which IT can help students learn from Wheeler-dealer and similar\nrole-play exercises: supporting the student groups in their decision-making (decision\nsupport), and supporting the administration of the exercise and the process of negotiation\n(mechanical support). Our work so far has concentrated on the former.\nDecision support\nThe field of decision-support systems is only some twenty years old, and many of its\nproblems have not yet been satisfactorily resolved (see, for example, Silver, 1991).\nProviding decision support which enhances learning is a harder problem still. Fortunately,\nthis task is made feasible because Wheeler-dealer is based on a model of the contracting\nprocess, developed by Akroyd (1987). This characterizes the process in terms of negotiation\nand risk, and thereby provides an appropriate theoretical framework for activities\nrevolving around the practical application of legal principles. A typical Wheeler-dealer role-\nplay takes place in four phases, two for the Relationship stage and two for the Dispute\nstage, as shown in Table 1. They are described further in Akroyd and Edwards (1995a).\nTable 1: The stages and phases in the negotiating process\nStage\nPreliminary\n1. Relationship\n2. Dispute\nPhase\nIntroduction\nla\nlb\n2a\n2b\nTitle\nIntroduction to the exercise\nNegotiation\nFulfilment\nLitigation\nEnforcement\nActivity\nCreation of legal interests and risks\n(Non-)fulfilment interests\n(Non-)avoidance of risks\nResolution of disputes\nEnforcement of awards or judgements\nInitial scenarios are given to student teams at the start of each phase, supplemented as\nnecessary in accordance with a developing situation. Student teams respond by carrying\nout five functions:\n\u2022 allocate individual roles;\n\u2022 research legal and factual information;\n\u2022 develop a plan to maximize legal interests with a minimum of legal risk;\n104\nALT-] Volume 3 Number I\n\u2022 implement the plan in role-play;\n\u2022 review the outcome of the plan strategically.\nAs well as giving and receiving evidence of transactions in accordance with the applicable\nlaw, play includes the obtaining of any registration, consent, sanction or adjudication\nfrom the relevant public authorities (all of which will be role-played by a tutor) in the\ncorrect manner. This necessitates accurate prior identification of such bodies and careful\nappraisal of the process involved.\nOne system (Sales Contractor) to provide decision support for the players has been\ndeveloped, and another (Contract Negotiator) is in the process of construction. Sales\nContractor is written in the expert system shell Xi Plus, and advises on drawing up a\ncontract for the sale of goods (see Akroyd and Edwards, 1995b). Its function is that of a\ndecision-support system rather than that of the classic expert system, since the final choice\nis always left with the user. This is particularly satisfactory for learning purposes. In\nWheeler-dealer, it is most useful in helping to draft documentary evidence of sales\ncontract terms and conditions of trade. The detailed wording of clauses or advice was\nbased on Akroyd (1984).\nOne screen from Sales Contractor, regarding provisions for checking the goods, is shown\nin Figure 1.\nApplication: Sales Contractor U. 0.3\nKnowledaebase: core knowledge\n\u00abXt\u00ab5Hi*tiwe clwrce* r\u00ab9\u00abf\u00e2lins provision for <?3wckii\u00bbs the\nfifi*\u00ab*: ciboos\u00ab the ottft Irfhitk \u00a36tt f ee l Is propri\u00e2t*\nthft\nare\nClaused\nUpon receipt of the goods, the Buyer will inspect then and uill lodge\nIt is expressif; aijreed. that the Buyer will be entitled to inspect and test\n;\u00eeie \u00aboods dupincr manufacture.

It\nconsists of a series of 36 questions, each relating to a set of legal issues, running through\nphases la, lb, 2a and 2b (see Table 1). This main structure is supported by:\n\u2022 a Research Menu, allowing access to a digest of legal advice, the online database\nLEXIS, and databases of contract and procedural forms;\n\u2022 a Risk Advisor, in the event of the user wishing to proceed without sufficient proof of\nrelevant legal principle or fact;\n\u2022 an Action Pad, allowing access to Sales Contractor, a word-processing package,\nelectronic mail, and in principle also telephone or fax.\nContract Negotiator is at present in prototype form. An example of a question from phase\nla is shown in Figure 2.\n^ ^\n2; >An example of a question from Contract Negotiator\nFor each question, the only possible answers are Don't know, No or Yes. Figure 3 shows\nthe relationship between these answers and the parts of Contract Negotiator, and how\nthese relate to the functions in the negotiating process.\nThe current (third) prototype of Contract Negotiator is the first networked version,\nadding access to LEXIS and electronic mail to the capabilities of the second prototype.\n106\nVolume 3 Number I\nFigure 4: The structure of\nContract Negotiator and\nits relationship to the\nnegotiating process\nCan you discharge your party's burden of proof for Issue k?\nRISK ADVISOR\nOptions (n order\nof increasing\nrisk, ending in\nadvice to stop\n- user may stil l\nchoose to go on\nACTION PAD\n\u2022 Word\nprocessor\n\u2022 Electronic\nmail\n\u2022 SALES\nCONTRACTOR\n\u2022 Goto\nIssue (k+1)\nRESEARCH MENL\nDigest\nLEXIS\nLegal forms\n\u2022 Return to\nmain menu\n(still on\nissue k)\nThere is no significant software problem in including links to further applications\npackages, or to communications media such as telephone and fax in the Action Pad - only\nthe hardware problem of ensuring that suitable connections, such as fax modems, exist.\nMechanical support\nThe use of networked systems to enable file transfer and electronic mail between\nparticipants has been technologically feasible for some years, and has now reached the\nstage where the use of such facilities is sufficiently familiar as to impose no extra burden\non business students. However, two related issues remain. The first is that replacing\nphysical paper delivery of documents and face-to-face contact by electronic means may\nreduce the opportunity for feedback between tutor and student. We believe that an\napplication such as Fujitsu's DTC (DeskTop Conferencing) software, enabling tutor and\nstudent to work on the same display while in different locations, may avoid this. We hope\n107\nJohn S. Edwards and Robert I. Akruyd Using information technology to help Business students\nstudent to work on the same display while in different locations, may avoid this. We hope\nto experiment with this in the coming year. The second problem is less easily dealt with.\nUnder English law, the legal status of a document stored only as a file on a computer is\nnot the same as that of a printed one. It would thus be both unwise and unrealistic to\nreplace paper with electronic 'documents' in Wheeler-dealer to any greater extent than is\nalready done in the real world (for example, the use of a word processor to produce\nstandard contracts).\nEvaluation\nTrials of Sales Contractor have been carried out with commercial law students, who used\nthe system to produce contracts as part of their coursework. This meant that a fully\ncontrolled experiment was not possible; it would not have been fair, in academic terms, to\nhave a control group. Comparisons are therefore at a broad level, and on an indirect\nbasis, against students undertaking the module in previous years.\nSales Contractor has proved easy to use and robust. Specific advantages are:\n\u2022 The production of a contract is very much quicker, taking about five minutes for a user\nmoderately familiar with the choices offered. This compares with a typical time period\npreviously of between one and three hours, often spread over more than one day.\n\u2022 The contracts produced are, in the tutors' judgement, inherently better than those\nproduced previously, even with access to standard practitioners' works such as the\nEncyclopaedia of Forms and Precedents (1985). This is because the system facilitates the\nchoice of suitable, well drafted provisions, and militates against total omission of\nprovisions, previously a common fault.\n\u2022 The students find the on-screen legal advice more digestible than the textbook format,\nfor two reasons. The first is that it comes in relatively small and manageable chunks,\nand the second is the use of colour to distinguish references to legal authority and cases\nfrom the text of the advice.\n\u2022 The system can be used to produce alternative contract versions for comparison.\nA number of limitations and weaknesses have also become apparent:\n\u2022 The present system has no facility for the user to modify the provisions. Such a facility\nwould have to allow change while preventing the introduction of errors, which is\ndifficult to achieve without compromising the normative effect of the system, since the\nusers, by definition, have little legal expertise.\n\u2022 It is still possible for a user to produce a wilfully or recklessly inappropriate contract.\n\u2022 As a learning aid, the full range of potential clauses on each point has been curtailed.\n\u2022 The suggested clauses are often too long to fit into the fields available. This is because\nwe have been using Xi Plus running under DOS. An implementation based on\nWindows or another graphical user-interface which allowed more flexible scrolling and\n108\nALT-J Volume 3 Number I\nresizing would minimize this problem. We intend to try the version of Xi Plus for\nWindows which has recently become available.\nConclusion\nSales Contractor is designed for a specific task, namely producing contracts for the sale of\ngoods, and has already proved useful to business students studying law. Contract\nNegotiator will provide more general support for the negotiation of contracts, legal\nrelationships and disputes. More than just a stand-alone system, it is also a structure\nlinking several other applications, including Sales Contractor (it is due to be tested with\nstudents during the academic year 1994\/95). The suitability of these two systems for\nstudent learning, although they are decision-support systems, arises because they are\nstructured around the relevant legal principles.\nReferences\nAkroyd, R.I.
