Scope: textbook. Level: advanced\nundergraduate and postgraduate.\nThe natural world is full of patterns, many of which are strikingly beautiful. An intriguing\nfeature is that remarkably similar-looking patterns can arise in entirely different contexts.\nFor example, sand ripples created by the desert wind take much the same form as the\nstripes on a zebra\u2019s flanks; and both resemble convection rolls and the stripe patterns that\ndevelop by aggregation in a thin layer of small particles on a horizontally-shaken substrate.\nIn each case there is a pattern of stripes incorporating defects such as dislocations. A\nstrong implication of such correspondences is that the underlying mathematics in each of\nthese examples must also be very similar. A vigorous research activity is in progress to\ntry to understand the formation and evolution of patterns, and the reasons why one kind\nof pattern is preferred over another in any particular case.\nRebecca Hoyle\u2019s book originated in a lecture course that she gave in Cambridge. It is\nintended to provide an introduction to the range of methods now available for the analysis\nof natural patterns, at level suitable for postgraduates or final year undergraduates. Her\nemphasis is on using symmetries to describe universal classes of pattern, rather than in\ntreating particular physical examples.\nThe book opens with introductory remarks about what is meant by a pattern \u2013 struc-\ntures that strike the eye as being regular in some way, often being spatially periodic,\nat least locally. The introductory chapter gives a short survey of the kinds of natural\npatterns that occur. In addition to stripes, there are e.g. squares and hexagons, rotating\nspirals and pulsating target patterns. The author offers several examples including irreg-\nular hexagonal patterns on giraffes and in convecting cooking oil (and provides a recipe\nfor the latter experiment), spiral patterns in the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction, Turing\npatterns in reaction-diffusion systems, and Faraday waves (standing wave patterns on the\nsurface of a vertically vibrated layer of fluid). The rest of the book is devoted to a more\ndetailed and rigorous devlopment of these initial ideas.\nChapters 2 and 3 provide the necessary background in bifurcation theory and group\ntheory, respectively, both of which are needed for analysis of the patterns. Chapters 4\u201311\nare the real meat of the book. They bring together a number of different methods. The\n1\nPublished in Contemp. Phys. 47, 235 (2006).\ntopics covered include bifurcations with symmetry, simple lattice patterns, superlattices\nand hidden symmetries, spatial modulation, instabilities of stripes, travelling plane waves,\nspirals, large-aspect-ratio systems and the Cross-Newell equation. The treatment is nec-\nessarily detailed and mathematical, but the author goes to considerable lengths to explain\nwhat is going on as clearly as possible.\nThe book is attractively produced and well-written in an engaging style. There are\nexercises for the student at the ends of chapters 2\u201311, an extensive bibliography, and\na good index. I suspect that general physics undergraduates, even in their final year,\nwill find the main part of the text quite demanding; it is more for mathematicians and\ntheoretical physicists. However, any physicist should be able to read the first chapeter\nwith interest and enjoyment, and he or she can then dip into the sections of chapters\n2\u201311 relevant to his or her particular interests. The author is to be congratulated on\nproducing a fine book that promises to be of continuing value to the diverse group of\nscientists and mathematicians interested in pattern formation and, in particular, to PhD\nstudents entering this fascinating area of interdisciplinary investigation.\nPeter V.
