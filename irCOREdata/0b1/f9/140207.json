Introduction\nIn today\u2019s global economy, companies are trying to re-invent their businesses and\nmaintain their competitive advantage through collaboration. Collaborative practices such\nas supply chains, value chains, extended enterprises, virtual enterprises and clusters are\nbecoming commonplace. However, collaboration for collaboration sake is not enough; if\nbusinesses are to maintain their competitive advantage and continue to sustain their\nperformance, collaboration should result in creation of new and unique value propositions\nbased on a unified approach to value creation.\nThe proposition underpinning the work presented in this paper is that value creation in\ncollaborative organisations should be a win-win-win situation for all parties concerned.\nTo this end, the purpose of this paper is to develop a better understanding of value\ncreation and the role of value propositions in collaborative networks such as supply\nchains, extended\/virtual enterprises and clusters. This is achieved by examining the\ntheory behind value creation and value propositions in the context of different\ncollaborative enterprises\/networks. As a conclusion a comparison of different\ncollaborative enterprises\/networks is presented with particular emphasis on the different\nvalue transactions and their relationship with individual and collective capabilities and\ncompetencies.\n2. Value\nBititci, Martinez, Albores and Parung, 2004, Creating and Managing Value in Collaborative Networks,\nInternational Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, issue 3\/4, 2004.\nToday, the concept of value is of increasing interest to both academics and practitioners\nin different fields such as economics, operations management, marketing, construction\nmanagement and so on. As a result there are a large number of definitions for the term\n\u201cvalue\u201d.\nIn order to have a better understanding of value in the context of collaboration, we have\nto link two perspectives of value (Martinez, 2003). These are:\n\uf0a7 Internal value, i.e. shareholder perspective, where value = wealth\n\uf0a7 External value, i.e. customer perspective, where value = satisfaction\nAccording to Martinez (2003) \u201cValue resides in the satisfaction and fulfilment of\ncustomers\u2019 expectations, at the same time, generating wealth for organisations.\u201d\nIn other words, an organisation in satisfying it\u2019s customers\u2019 expectations, should be\ncreating wealth for its shareholders; hence creating value for both parties. Accordingly,\nvalue creation in collaborative organisations should be a win-win-win situation for all\nparties concerned. The partners should each benefit from collaboration by increasing\ninternal value to their shareholders as well as delivering better value (external) to the end-\ncustomer.\nThe generic value propositions presented in the Value Matrix (Martinez and Bititci,\n2001) have shown a focused way to guide organisations for creating unique value. This is\nbecause the value proposition differentiates from the traditional view of value (internal-\nBititci, Martinez, Albores and Parung, 2004, Creating and Managing Value in Collaborative Networks,\nInternational Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, issue 3\/4, 2004.\noriented view) by looking at the business from a customer perspective (external oriented\nview).\n3. Value Propositions\nThe value proposition is defined as \u201can implicit promise a company makes to its\ncustomers to deliver a particular combination of values\u201d (Martinez, 2003). Each\nproposition searches for a unique value that can be delivered to a chosen market.\nSuccessful companies do not just add value, they re-invent it.\nThe application of this concept has changed the focus of operations in many businesses\nby redefining their competencies and capabilities (e.g. IBM, DELL, ICI, Federal\nExpress). In doing so, these companies have also made some fundamental decisions on\ncustomer segmentation, competencies, culture, infrastructure, technology, resources and\nstrategies (O\u2019Dell and Grayson, 1999).\nThe Value Matrix (Martinez and Bititci, 2001), illustrated in Figure 1, proposes six\ngeneric value propositions. These value propositions are an extension of the three original\nvalue propositions proposed by Treacy and Wiersema (1996) by introduction of the new\nvalue dimension, i.e Hard Value and Soft Value. Table 1 explains each value proposition\nfrom the customer perspective as \u201cCustomers get\u201d and company perspective as\n\u201cCompany needs to do\u201d.\nBititci, Martinez, Albores and Parung, 2004, Creating and Managing Value in Collaborative Networks,\nInternational Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, issue 3\/4, 2004.\nFigure 1.

However, if collaboration is to\nresult in creation of new and unique value propositions based on a unified approach to\nvalue creation, then the role of value propositions in collaborative networks needs to be\nbetter understood.\n4. Collaboration\nCollaboration literally means working-together (Huxham, 1996, Jordan Jr. and Michel,\n2000). The term is often used when individuals or organisations work together towards a\ncommon aim. The other terms that are used to describe this situation are relationships,\npartnerships or alliances.\nBititci, Martinez, Albores and Parung, 2004, Creating and Managing Value in Collaborative Networks,\nInternational Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, issue 3\/4, 2004.\nCollaboration has been discussed as a way forward for organisations in situations in\nwhich working alone is not sufficient to achieve the desired ends (Huxham, 1996). Most\ndefinitions of collaboration are based on this assumption as follows. Collaboration is:\n\uf0a7 taken to imply a very positive form of working in association with others for some\nform of mutual benefit (Huxham, 1996).\n\uf0a7 a distinct mode of organising, implies a positive, purposeful relationship between\norganisations that retain autonomy, integrity and distinct identity, and thus, the\npotential to withdraw from the relationship (Huxham, 1996).\n\uf0a7 a number of companies linked to create and support a service or product for its\nservice life including final disposal (Jordan and Michel, 2000).\n\uf0a7 a focus on joint planning, coordination and process integration between supplier,\ncustomers and others partners in a supply chain. Also involves strategic joint decision\nmaking about partnership and network design (McLaren et al, 2002).\n\uf0a7 a process in which organizations exchange information, alter activities, share\nresources and enhance each other\u2019s capacity for mutual benefit and a common\npurpose by sharing risks, responsibilities and rewards\u2019 (Himmelman, 1992 in\nHuxham, 1996).\n5. Collaboration: Motives and Benefits\nThe literature on collaboration suggests that implementation of collaborative initiatives\nhas inherited difficulties; therefore the amount of effort involved in integrating\noperational, tactical or strategic levels of separate companies is usually large. However,\nthe same literature also reports that the benefits of such collaboration are considered to be\nBititci, Martinez, Albores and Parung, 2004, Creating and Managing Value in Collaborative Networks,\nInternational Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, issue 3\/4, 2004.\nsignificant. Some motives and benefits associated with inter-enterprise collaboration\nhave been identified as:\n\uf0a7 To increase their market share (Lewis, 1990).\n\uf0a7 To increase asset utilization (Lewis, 1990).\n\uf0a7 To enhance customer service \u2013 reduction in lead times, customer complaints, etc.\n(Lewis, 1990).\n\uf0a7 To share and reduce the cost of product development (Lewis, 1990; Parker,2000;\nHorvarth, 2001; McLaren et al., 2002)\n\uf0a7 To reduce time in product development (Lewis, 1990; Parker, 2000; McCarthy and\nGolicic, 2002,McLaren et al., 2002;)\n\uf0a7 To decrease risk of failure of product development (Parker,2000)\n\uf0a7 To increase quality of product (Lewis, 1990)\n\uf0a7 To enhance skill and knowledge (Lewis, 1990)\n\uf0a7 To have technological gain as participating firm (Lewis, 1990; Parker, 2000)\n\uf0a7 To achieve economies of scale in production (Lewis, 1990)\n\uf0a7 To reduce inventory - in the face of increasing technological complexity and rapid\nrate product development and obsolescence (Parker, 2000, Holton,2001)\n\uf0a7 To gain rapid access to markets (Parker, 2000; McCarthy and Golicic, 2002)\nIn context of the research proposition that underpins this paper, collaboration should lead\nto a win-win-win situation for all parties concerned ( i.e participating partners as well as\nthe end-customer). There is no doubt that the motivation for each individual enterprise\ncomes not from the fact that they want to collaborate but from the fact that there are\nBititci, Martinez, Albores and Parung, 2004, Creating and Managing Value in Collaborative Networks,\nInternational Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, issue 3\/4, 2004.\neconomic advantages to be gained through collaboration. But what about the end\ncustomer? How does or should the combined competencies of participating partners\naffect the value proposition of the collaborative enterprise to the end-customer?\nIn order to provide logical answers to these questions it is necessary to understand the\nliterature relating to collaborative networks such as supply chains, extended enterprises,\nvirtual enterprises and clusters.\n6. Collaborative Networks and Value Propositions\nIn this paper, we argue that the type of value created and obtained by a specific\ncollaboration is dependent on the degree of maturity of that collaboration. A framework\nto describe the maturity of the collaboration is proposed by Childerhouse et al (2003),\nwhich presents five stages of maturity: Ad hoc, Defined, Linked, Integrated and\nExtended. Although this model is focused primarily on supply chains, the different\nstages of maturity for collaborative enterprises may be categorised as:\n\uf0a7 Ad hoc \u2013 collaboration does not go beyond the traditional customer supplier\nrelationship.\n\uf0a7 Defined and Linked \u2013 collaboration focuses on operational issues and limited to\ncollaborative planning, forecasting and replenishment of materials and capacities, i.e.\nSupply Chain Management.\n\uf0a7 Integrated + Extended\u2013 collaboration at a strategic level where integrated and\ncoordinated strategies lead to strategic synergy, i.e. Extended and Virtual Enterprises.\nBititci, Martinez, Albores and Parung, 2004, Creating and Managing Value in Collaborative Networks,\nInternational Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, issue 3\/4, 2004.\n\uf0a7 To this spectrum of maturity, we would also add Clusters, which represent integrated\ncollaborations which also include supporting infrastructures.\nThe following sections provide a more detailed discussion on how the combined\ncompetencies of participating partners can affect and shape the value proposition of\ntypical collaborative networks, such as supply chains, extended enterprises, virtual\nenterprises and clusters. In doing so, the \u201cvalue transactions\u201d across the network, in\nwhich value is promised, planned, managed and delivered, are identified as well as\nhighlighting the differences that this has for companies working in different collaborative\nnetworks.\n6.1 Supply Chains\nDuring the last decade, companies have started to have awareness of the need to take into\naccount their suppliers and customers. Traditionally, the focus has been on the supply\nchain in order to manage the movement of materials from suppliers to end customer\nefficiently and effectively. Supply chain management models such as SCOR (Supply\nChain Operations Reference model - www.supply-chain.org) identify the need for\nexternal integration between the supply chain partners. But this integration remains at an\noperational level. At best, supply chains are about collaborative planning, fulfilment and\nreplenishment (CPFR), but do not achieve the level of strategic collaboration and synergy\nalong the supply chain.\nBititci, Martinez, Albores and Parung, 2004, Creating and Managing Value in Collaborative Networks,\nInternational Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, issue 3\/4, 2004.\nEssentially, in supply chains, each company plans its operations according to the orders\nreceived and forecasted and commits capacities and delivery dates according to their\nindividual loads and capacities. Accordingly, strategy for companies in the supply chain\nis formulated at the enterprise level, not at the supply chain level. Generally, the analysis\nof supply chains has taken place from the point of view of one of the members of the\nsupply chain and not for the supply chain as a whole, trying to improve the \u201csupply chain\nrelated processes\u201d of a single company, rather than really optimising the whole of the\nsupply chain. This issue is found repeatedly in the literature, e.g. Darroch et al., (2002)\nand Rudberg and Olhager (2003) present studies of value and strategy from the point of\nview of different partners in the SC, but do not consider the collaborative system as a\nwhole.\nSome authors have described the need to align the members of the supply chain in order\nto gain better performance (e.g. Carbo, 2002). Childerhouse et al, (2002) and Eloranta\n(1999) propose the analysis of demand chains in order to achieve better performance in\nthe demand chain. However, the approach is still centred on the individual company,\nrather than on the SC as a whole.\nTaking the view of supply chain management as simply the management of the logistics\noperations of a company, both upstream and downstream, we can see that the value\npropositions of the supply chain members are disjointed, focusing on delivering value to\nthe next member in the chain, and not worrying about the overall value proposition that is\nimportant to the end customer.\nBititci, Martinez, Albores and Parung, 2004, Creating and Managing Value in Collaborative Networks,\nInternational Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, issue 3\/4, 2004.\nFigure 2 illustrates the value propositions that emerge in supply chain type collaborations\nwhere the companies in the supply chain select their individual value proposition,\naligning it to the next member of the supply chain. In this case, the value proposition of\nthe overall supply chain is the same as that of the company that is facing the end\ncustomer (E3 in Figure 2) \u2013 that is the value proposition is a function (\uf0a6) of the\ncompetences and capabilities of that last company in the chain.\nVPSC = VPE3= \uf0a6 (CCE3)\nVPSC \u2013 Value proposition of the supply chain\nVPE3 \u2013 Value proposition of Enterprise #3\nCCE3 \u2013 Competencies and capabilities of Enterprise #3\nFigure 2. Value propositions (VP) in supply chains\n6.2 Extended and Virtual Enterprises\nAccording to Childe (1998) an extended enterprise is \u2018a conceptual business unit or\nsystem that consists of a purchasing company and suppliers who collaborate closely in\nsuch a way as to maximise the returns to each partner\u2019.\nIn this paper, the virtual enterprise is considered as a temporal case of an extended\nenterprise. I.e. the virtual enterprise is a dynamic partnership among companies that can\nE1 E3E2 EndCustomer\nE 4\nVP\nVP\nOperational integration\nalong the SC\nVPE2 VPE1\nE 5\nVPE3=VPSC\nThe Supply Chain\nBititci, Martinez, Albores and Parung, 2004, Creating and Managing Value in Collaborative Networks,\nInternational Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, issue 3\/4, 2004.\nbring together complementary competencies needed to achieve a particular business task,\nwithin a certain period of time (Kochhar and Zang, 2002).\nFrom the literature on extended and virtual enterprises the following pertinent points have\nbeen extracted as being of relevance to the research presented in this paper:\n\uf0b7 The extended enterprise is a philosophy where member organisations strategically\ncombine their core competencies and capabilities to create a unique competency. A\nfacet of this approach is the development of products and services that best fit the\nphysical and intellectual characteristic of the individual markets (Martinez et al.\n2001, Kochhar and Zhang 2002).\n\uf0b7 In extended enterprises, people across a number of organisations participate in the\ndecision-making process. This demands knowledge and resource integration (O\u2019Neill\nand Sackett 1994).\n\uf0b7 In an extended enterprise each company is self-organised, while the extended\nenterprise imposes a federal structure for communication and synchronisation\nbetween individual enterprises (Martinez et al. 2001).\n\uf0b7 The Extended Enterprise business strategy formulation is an incremental process;\nplanning, implementation, evaluation and revision represent small steps, done almost\nsimultaneously (Martinez et al. 2001, Lillehagen and Karlsen 2001).\nBititci, Martinez, Albores and Parung, 2004, Creating and Managing Value in Collaborative Networks,\nInternational Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, issue 3\/4, 2004.\nIn a supply chain, each participating company operating as an individual enterprise tries\nto maximise its own corporate goals, thus sub-optimising the overall performance. An\nextended enterprise is a chain of enterprises, which essentially behave as a single\nenterprise trying to maximise the corporate goals of the extended enterprise, thus\noptimising the performance of each individual enterprise (Bititci et al, 2003). This\ndifference is illustrated in Figure 3. The serial and parallel configuration of the extended\nenterprise is determined by its needs, i.e. competencies, capabilities and resources.\nFigure 3.

The whole extended\/virtual enterprise follows a common value proposition\nthat is focused on the delivery of a specific value for a selected market (end customer). It\nis characterised by its strategic and operational collaboration.\nThe integration of the value proposition\u2019s actors implies that the individual competencies\nand capabilities (CC) are integrated and complement each other, thus they are aligned to\n\u2018the overall value proposition of the extended\/virtual enterprise\u2019 to create a particular\nvalue for the end customers.\nVPEE = \uf0a6(CCEE)\uf0b3 [ CCE1 + CCE2 + CCE3 +\u2026.+ CCEn ]\nBititci, Martinez, Albores and Parung, 2004, Creating and Managing Value in Collaborative Networks,\nInternational Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, issue 3\/4, 2004.\nVPEE = Value Proposition of the extended\/virtual enterprise\nCCEE = Collective competencies and capabilities of the extended\/virtual enterprise\nCCEn = Individual competencies and capabilities of the participating companies\nIn the literature the basic assumption is that collaboration takes place between individual\ncompanies\/enterprises. However, according to the empirical evidence provided by Bititci\net al (2003), the architecture of the extended enterprise is somewhat more complex then\nthe one illustrated in Figure 3. The critical points are that:\n\uf0a7 Extended\/virtual enterprises emerge as a result of collaboration between business\nunits of companies, rather than whole companies.\n\uf0a7 One company could be participating in more than one extended enterprise\nThe extended enterprise shown in Figure 4 is formed by the business units of three\nenterprises, i.e. BU1, BU2 and BU3 (illustrated with the solid-white arrows). This figure\nshows the value proposition of the EE (VPEE)at the top of the EE triangle, it is supported\nby the value propositions of its actors (VP1, VP2 and VP3).\nThe value proposition of the extended enterprise is determined by a meta-level\nmanagement process, which plans, co-ordinates and reviews the value creation process of\nthe entire extended enterprise to achieve strategic and operational synergy. A function of\nthis meta-manage process is to ensure that strategic synergy is maintained between the\nmembers of the extended enterprise by ensuring the individual capabilities and\ncompetencies (therefore the individual value propositions) of each business unit is\naligned with the value proposition of the extended enterprise. In achieving this strategic\nBititci, Martinez, Albores and Parung, 2004, Creating and Managing Value in Collaborative Networks,\nInternational Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, issue 3\/4, 2004.\nsynergy, the value proposition of each business unit is likely to be different but\ncomplimentary to one another.\nFigure 4.

Essentially this represents the value a\nsingle member adds to the overall extended enterprise. This is a function of its core\ncompetencies and capabilities (CCEn) - i.e. VPEn = \uf0a6(CCEn)\n\uf0a7 Extended-enterprise value proposition (VPEE) - the value proposition of the extended\nenterprise to its end-customers. This is a function of the combined competencies and\ncapabilities (CCEE) of the extended enterprise, which is equal or bigger than the sum\nof the individual members competencies and capabilities (CCEn)\nBititci, Martinez, Albores and Parung, 2004, Creating and Managing Value in Collaborative Networks,\nInternational Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, issue 3\/4, 2004.\nVPEE = \uf0a6(CCEE) \uf0b3 [CCE1 + CCE2 + CCE3]\n6.3 Clusters\nA cluster could be define as a network of companies, their customers and suppliers of all\nthe relevant factors, including materials and components, equipment, training, finance\nand so on (Carrie, 1999). Furthermore, Jones (2002) describes clusters as networks of\ninterdependent firms, knowledge producing institutions, technology providing firms,\nbridging institutions and customers, linked in a value creating production chain. Clusters\nare also defined as geographic concentrations of interconnected companies and\ninstitutions in a particular field. Clusters encompass an array of linked industries and\nother entities important to competition. They include, for example, supplier of specialised\ninputs such as components, machinery, and services, and provides of specialised\ninfrastructure (Porter, 1998).\nIn clusters, facilitators assist and encourage companies, educational institutes\n(universities, colleges, etc), consultants, vocational training providers and trade\nassociation to collaborate and create more value. Facilitators could be government\nagencies (as in the Scottish model), volunteers (as in the Arizona model) or executives of\nthe participants (as in the Basque model). The participants such as educational\ninstitutions (universities, colleges), consultants, vocational training providers and trade\nassociations, provide specialised training, education, information, research, and technical\nsupport to a core group of companies which create value for the entire cluster. The\ncompanies collaborate in the cluster with each other by sharing information and\nBititci, Martinez, Albores and Parung, 2004, Creating and Managing Value in Collaborative Networks,\nInternational Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, issue 3\/4, 2004.\nintegrating similar activities (such as research, education, marketing, IT) in order to\nachieve better competitive advantages for the members and to support the economic\nregion. These competitive advantages could be:\n\uf0a7 Reduce the unit cost by providing technical services to clustered businesses (Porter,\n1998; Nolan, 2002)\n\uf0a7 Reduced transaction cost because firms and their supplier operate near each other\n(Nolan, 2002;)\n\uf0a7 Integrated research (Bititci and Carrie, 1999; Porter, 1998; Arbonies and Moso, 2002)\n\uf0a7 Economies of scale (Carrie, 2000; Nolan, 2002)\n\uf0a7 Attractive innovation (Arbonies and Moso, 2002; Scheel, 2002)\n\uf0a7 Improved customer service e.g. shorter delivery time because of mutual\nunderstanding to help each other between members of the cluster (Carrie, 2000)\n\uf0a7 Improved time to market of new products (Carrie, 2000)\n\uf0a7 Stronger bargaining power in all respects, including suppliers, government (e.g. built\ninfrastructure, tax incentive) and other relevant bodies (Scheel, 2002)\n\uf0a7 Greater scale and presence without sacrificing flexibility (Porter, 1998).\nFigure 5 provides a pictorial illustration of a cluster.\nBititci, Martinez, Albores and Parung, 2004, Creating and Managing Value in Collaborative Networks,\nInternational Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, issue 3\/4, 2004.\nFigure 5. The cluster\nBased on the literature on clusters we have at the following conclusions:\n\uf0a7 In an extended enterprise there is a higher degree of strategic and operational\nintegration between the members. In a cluster there is a degree of strategic integration\nwithin the core-network in order to leverage the support functions but the focus is still\non the creation of competitive advantage for each individual enterprise. Therefore\nstrategic synergy and operational integration are not necessary.\n\uf0a7 In a cluster each member can leverage the advantages of being a member of the\ncluster to develop its own competitive advantage by enhancing its competencies and\nThe Supporting\nInfrastructure\nSustainable\nCompetitive\nAdvantage\nSuppliers DistributorsManufacturers\nFi\nna\nnc\nia\nl\nIn\nst\nitu\ntio\nns\nG\nov\ner\nnm\nen\nt\nde\npa\nrt\nm\nen\nts\nE\ndu\nca\ntio\nn\nan\nd\nT\nra\nin\nin\ng\nin\nst\n.\nR\nes\nea\nrc\nh\nIn\nst\nitu\ntio\nns\nEquipm\nent\nM\nanufacturers\nR\nD\nA\ns\nTrade\nA\nssociations\nThe Core-Network\nE\nE\nE\nE\nE\nE\nE\nE\nE\nE E\nE\nFi\nna\nnc\nia\nl\nIn\nst\nitu\ntio\nns\nG\nov\ner\nnm\nen\nt\nde\npa\nrt\nm\nen\nts\nE\ndu\nca\ntio\nn\nan\nd\nT\nra\nin\nin\ng\nin\nst\n.\nR\nes\nea\nrc\nh\nIn\nst\nitu\ntio\nns\nEquipm\nent\nM\nanufacturers\nR\nD\nA\ns\nTrade\nA\nssociations\nBititci, Martinez, Albores and Parung, 2004, Creating and Managing Value in Collaborative Networks,\nInternational Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, issue 3\/4, 2004.\ncapabilities to develop a unique value propositions for its own target customers and\nmarkets.\n\uf0a7 Clusters may provide the ideal environment within which extended\/virtual enterprises\nmay emerge.\nThus we have identified the following value transactions within a cluster:\n\uf0a7 Shareholder value \u2013 the value proposition of each member (enterprise or support\ninstitution) to its shareholders \u2013 this is essentially equivalent to internal value as\ndefined in the value creation literature\n\uf0a7 Intra-cluster value proposition (VPICn) \u2013 the value proposition of each member to the\noverall cluster. Essentially this represents the value a single member adds to the\noverall cluster. This is a function of its members core competencies and capabilities\n(CCMn) - i.e. VPICn = \uf0a6(CCMn)\n\uf0a7 Cluster value proposition (VPC) - the value proposition of the cluster to external\nmarkets. This is a function of the combined competencies and capabilities of the\ncluster (CCC), which is the sum of the individual members competencies and\ncapabilities (CCMn) \u2013 i.e. VPC = \uf0a6CCC \uf0b3 [CCM1 + CCM2 + CCM3]. Although, on the\nsurface this sounds similar to the external value proposition for the extended\nenterprise, it is inherently different. The value proposition of the cluster to its external\nmarkets is a structural and infrastructural proposition (e.g. an OEM may wish to form\npartnerships to purchase its components from an SME which is operating within a\ngood cluster because this structural and infrastructural support available to the SME.\nSimilarly an external investor may be more likely to invest in a venture which is\nBititci, Martinez, Albores and Parung, 2004, Creating and Managing Value in Collaborative Networks,\nInternational Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, issue 3\/4, 2004.\nsupported by a good cluster). Where as the external-enterprise value proposition is\nmore likely to be a combination of the generic value propositions presented in Figure\n1.\n\uf0a7 Individual value proposition (VPM) \u2013 This is the value proposition of each member to\nits own customers\/markets. This is a function of its own competencies and\ncapabilities (CCMn) as well as the value proposition of the entire cluster (VPC) \u2013 i.e.\nVPM= \uf0a6[CCMn+ VPC].\n7. Discussion and Conclusions\nCompanies working together are commonly known as collaborative enterprises. From a\nnetwork point of view, collaborative enterprise or network could be define as: a distinct\nmode of organisation in which participant organisations work together in equity,\ncommitment and trust exchanging information, sharing activities and resources and\ncomplimenting and enhancing each other\u2019s capacity for mutual benefit and a common\npurpose by sharing risks, responsibilities and rewards\u2019.\nThe research has identified different levels of collaboration and categorised each one of\nthe existing collaborative enterprise models according to the level of collaboration\ninherent within the network\/enterprise, i.e. supply chains, extended and virtual enterprises\nand clusters. This led us to analyse and identify the value transactions in case of each\ncollaborative enterprise model.\nBititci, Martinez, Albores and Parung, 2004, Creating and Managing Value in Collaborative Networks,\nInternational Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, issue 3\/4, 2004.\nAccording to Jagdev and Thoben (2001), it is not possible to define a single criterion or\ndemarcation to distinguish collaboration in Supply chain, Extended Enterprise and\nVirtual Enterprise. The same applies to a lesser extend to a cluster. Therefore it is\nimportant to identify the key characteristics for each type of collaborative\nenterprise\/network. Table 2 is represents a first attempt at identifying these characteristics\nand associated value transactions as discussed in greater detail in the paper.\nAlthough the original literature on value creation identified two types of value transaction\n(Shareholder Value and Customer Value - i.e. the value proposition), in the case of\ncollaborative enterprises\/networks, this research has identified additional value\ntransactions. These may be summarised under four different headings as follows:\n\uf0a7 Shareholder value - the value proposition of each member to its shareholders \u2013 this is\nessentially equivalent to internal value as defined in the value creation literature.\n\uf0a7 Individual value proposition - the value proposition of each member to its end-\ncustomers. This is generally a function of each members\u2019 own competencies and\ncapabilities, except in the case of a cluster where members can leverage the\ncapabilities and competencies available in the cluster to enhance their own value\npropositions to their customers and markets.\n\uf0a7 Intra-network value proposition - the value proposition of each member to the overall\nnetwork. Essentially this represents the value a single member adds (or contribution it\nBititci, Martinez, Albores and Parung, 2004, Creating and Managing Value in Collaborative Networks,\nInternational Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, issue 3\/4, 2004.\nmakes) to the overall network. This is a function of its core competencies and\ncapabilities.\n\uf0a7 Network value proposition - the value proposition of the network to external markets.\nThis is a function of the combined competencies and capabilities of the network but it\nmay be a combination of traditional value propositions in the case of virtual and\nextended enterprises and a structural and infrastructural value proposition in the case\nof a supply chain.\nThis research highlighted the diverse and complicated nature of the value transactions in\ndifferent types of collaborative enterprises\/networks. It is demonstrated that network\ncollaborative enterprises\/networks can create a new and unique value propositions by\ncomplementing, integrating and leveraging each other\u2019s capabilities and competencies.\nFrom a methodological perspective, this is a theoretical paper, which deduced from\nliterature a specific understanding of the interplay between capabilities and competencies\nand value transactions in collaborative environments. This has resulted in a first-cut\nmodel \u2013 represented in the form of four value transactions and Table 2 \u2013 which should\nprovide a platform for further research in this area.\nBititci, Martinez, Albores and Parung, 2004, Creating and Managing Value in Collaborative Networks,\nInternational Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, issue 3\/4, 2004.\nTable 2.
