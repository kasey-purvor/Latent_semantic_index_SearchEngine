At that time\nthe main issues identified were those of 'partial credit' and communication between the\nstudent and the computer.

Background information on other features in Interactive\nPastPapers is also included to provide context for the discussion.\nIntroduction\nThe CALM Project for Computer Aided Learning in Mathematics started at Heriot-Watt\nUniversity in 1985. hi the first phase of the project CAL materials were created in calculus with\neach topic structured around Theory, Worked Examples, Motivating Examples and a Test.\nStudents chose most readily to work through the Test section questions, welcoming the chance\nto assess their own progress. In addition, the teachers could view class progress. The weekly\ntests were designed from banks of questions with randomized parameters in each question.\nThese questions prompted students for a mathematical answer and asked them to type in the\nresponse on one line using a style similar to computer languages such as Pascal. Students of\nengineering and science took only a short time to adjust to this approach. The routines\ndeveloped in those early stages of CALM meant that testing could be more meaningful and did\nnot rely on the more usual multiple-choice format favoured by so many computer projects. Over\n26\nALT-J Volume 7 Number I\nthe years 1989-1992 CALM developed techniques to trap predictable wrong answers and this\nform of self-testing proved to be a powerful learning aid for students. Nevertheless, some\nproblems which are discussed in greater detail in later sections remained.\nDespite these problems the assessment template which CALM created was used as a testing\nmechanism in collaborative projects such as the TLTP project, called Mathwise, and the\nSUMSMAN project. For further details see Harding and Quinney (1996), Beevers, Maciocia,\nPrince and Scott (1996), Beevers and Scott (1998) and Beevers, Bishop and Quinney (1998).\nMeanwhile the CALM project focused on the production of a commercial project, Interactive\nPastPapers (IPP), aided by the award of a Higher Education Tercentenary prize from the Bank\nof Scotland. Based on the work of Wild (1995) the CALM Group were able to investigate the\nsolutions to problems such as:\n\u2022 providing partial credit where students receive recognition for partly-correct or\nidiosyncratically expressed answers;\n\u2022 coping with difficulties students experience when they input answers.\nSee Wild, Beevers, Fiddes, McGuire, and Youngson (1997) and McGuire, Wild, Beevers,\nFiddes, and Youngson (1998) for further details.\nThe features of IPP relating to these issues will be described later after a discussion of some of\nthe educational issues raised by using computer assessment. The paper concludes with a\nsummary of the way ahead in this area.\nEducational discussion\nStudents of mathematics can be assessed in a number of ways. The computer can play a role in\nat least four types of assessment:\n\u2022 diagnostic tests where the emphasis is on helping students discover their strengths and\nweaknesses;\n\u2022 self-tests in which the emphasis is on rapid feedback and which can be used to pick out\npredictable wrong answers;\n\u2022 continuous assessment in which students and teachers alike can see how mathematical\ntopics are being absorbed;\n\u2022 grading assessment in which the computer is used in the setting and marking of\nexaminations.\nOver the years there has been much work in the area of diagnostic testing with examples like\nDiagnosis (Appleby, Samuels and Treasure-Jones, 1997). Diagnostic testing using student\nprofiling has been studied by Bridges and Hibberd (1994). This latter work is forming the basis\nof some current work on Web delivery of diagnostic tests.\nSelf-testing is a feature of the work of Harding, Lay, Moule, and Quinney (1995) in the\nRenaissance Project. CALM used this approach too in its pre-university mathematics\ncourseware units, where predictable wrong answers were trapped and fast feedback helped\nstudents consolidate their learning. Self-tests are also a feature of the many Mathwise modules\ndeveloped during the TLTP initiative.\n27\nC. E. Beevers et 0\/ Issues of partial credit in mathematical assessment by computer\nContinuous assessment was the driving force in the first CALM Project with weekly tests\nhelping the students assess their own progress through the material. Brunei, Portsmouth and\nGlasgow Caledonian Universities have used a similar approach with QuestionMark software\nand the CALMAT units (McCabe, 1995; Tabor, 1993).\nGrading assessment by computer has been pioneered at Heriot-Watt University initially using\nthe Mathwise assessment mechanism but latterly with the IPP assessment engine delivered over\nthe Web. Napier University under the SUMSMAN Project are employing Mathwise to assess\ntheir students and this is starting in other Scottish universities (Ashworth, 1998).\nThe commercial implementation of IPP has a number of features that help with the different\ntypes of assessment described above. For example, diagnostic tests can be set up using the\nmultiple-choice type of question. The marks recording service offered by IPP is then able to\nsupply information on the strengths and weaknesses of individual students.\nIPP has three modes of delivery:\n1. Help mode where students can reveal answers if they are stuck on a particular part;\n2. Practice mode in which the users are given visible feedback on the correctness of answers as\nthey proceed through a question;\n3. Examination mode in which the computer marks the question but no visible sign is shown\non screen.\nThese three modes simulate self-test, continuous assessment and grading assessment respect-\nively.\nQuestions can be chosen from banks of typical examples randomly, by topic or by particular\nquestion, thus providing different forms of testing at different times of the learning cycle. When\na test has been chosen the student can browse the questions as in a conventionally written\nexamination before moving on to answer a question. In the following section those aspects of\nIPP which deal with problems of partial credit and student input difficulties are considered.\nPartial credit\nWhen a student gets the same answer as the examiner to a mathematical question, assigning\nmarks for the answer is simple both for a human and a computer. However, deciding how to\nassign marks to other answers for which there is not a one-to-one correspondence may be\ntackled differently by humans and computers.\nAspects of partial credit\nA lack of confidence in the software's ability to assess answers has led to some student anxiety\nabout whether their results in a computer examination accurately reflect their knowledge.\nParticular issues of greatest concern are:\n\u2022 the computer input of a mathematical answer being interpreted by the computer in a\ndifferent manner from that which the student intended;\n\u2022 an answer being correct but in the wrong format;\n\u2022 recognition of a numerical approximation to the correct answer;\n28\nALT-J Volume 7 Number I\n\u2022 provision for a student giving one of a pair of answers correctly;\n\u2022 provision for a student answering a part of the question but not all of it.\nThe first of these has been tackled in IPP by the use of an Input Tool. This device shows the\nstudent how a one-line mathematical entry typed in by a student is being interpreted by the\ncomputer as the typing proceeds. For example, the student may wish the answer to b e ^ . The\nstudent types in l\/2x and the Input Tool window shows this as \u00a3.\nThis shows that the computer has interpreted this in a different way from that which the student\nintended, so it is possible to correct the input to 1\/(2*) which appears in the Input Tool window\na s l .\nIn addition, the Input Tool provides feedback on the syntax of expressions such as missing\nbrackets and the misuse of operands.\nTurning to the second of these items, answers which are close to the correct one but do not take\nthe approved form can be awarded partial credit as in the following example. If the answer to a\nproblem is 1\/2 and the student types 0.5 then the message can be displayed:\nYour answer is correct but in the wrong format, give your answer as a fraction - 50% partial\ncredit.\nIPP tries to capture good mathematical practice by looking for answers in a compact form. So, a\nmaximum length can be specified and students awarded partial credit for their answer if it is\nclose to the correct answer but not in the most compact form.\nA similar approach works for the third of these topics in which partial credit is given for\nanswers which contain a numerical approximation to the correct answer. If desired a warning\nmessage can be issued as in the following example. If the correct answer to a question is ^2 the\nstudent who types in the numerical approximation 1.414 (which is correct to three decimal\nplaces) might receive the message:\nYour answer should contain a square root - 75% partial credit.\nFrom the last two examples it can be seen that the percentage of partial credit given can vary at\nthe examiner's discretion.\nConcerning the fourth of these topics, many questions in IPP require answers in the form of\nunordered and ordered linked pairs (or triples). Examples of such questions are:\nWhat are the factors of x2 - 5x + 6 ?\nFind the co-ordinates of the y-intercept of the line,y = 3x + 7.\nThe first question has answers x - 2 and x - 3 which can be given in any order, whereas the\nsecond question has the answer (0,7) in which the order is important. If one of these answers is\ncorrect then appropriate partial credit can be awarded.\nA similar approach can deal with questions which require answers in scientific notation of the\nform a* 10b with a and b as an ordered linked pair and algebraic fractions x\/y with x andy again\nas an ordered pair.\n29\nC. \u00a3 Beevers et al Issues of partial credit in mathematical assessment by computer\nThe last issue is perhaps the most difficult to deal with. As an example of this type consider the\nquestion:\nFind the derivative of cos^c2)\nTo do this question (whose correct answer is -2xsin(3?)), the student needs to know the correct\nrule of differentiation to apply and the derivative of two simpler functions. If a student were to\nanswer 2xsin(x2) in which the correct rule has been identified and the derivative of one of the\ntwo functions has been correctly obtained, most human examiners would consider this answer\nworthy of some credit. CALM used a device in the self-assessment part of the pre-universiry\nCALM units in which predictable wrong answers were programmed into trapped errors so that\nsuch predictable answers could carry appropriate learning messages. However it could prove\ndifficult to list all the possible wrong answers which the student came up with!\nKey-steps and partial credit\nIPP has questions which have been set using key-steps. These key-steps have been broken down\ninto further sub-sets. It is up to the students to decide whether they wish to answer these sub-\nsets. A less confident student can tackle a question by asking for the sub-sets which would\npossibly enable some marks to be picked up. However in such cases the student will take\nlonger to answer the question but in Help or Practice mode this can aid the learning process. In\nExam mode a student has to decide whether the extra tune is worthwhile compared with the\npartial credit on offer in that question. This method of awarding partial credit has been steadily\nevolving over the last few years since the original experiment in 1994 was reported by Beevers,\nMcGuire, Stirling and Wild (1995). Whatever the mode, this extra flexibility has proved\npopular with students and has been introduced after much student feedback on earlier versions\nof the CALM test.\nIPP also provides an opportunity to deliver tests over the Web. So, in the winter term of 1997, two\nclasses with in excess of 350 undergraduates were introduced to tests using IPP. Of the two classes\nusing the IPP delivery over the Web the syllabus for the first class of over 200 students covered\ntopics in differentiation including hyperbolic equations, parametric equations, the McLaurin and\nTaylor series and integration topics including standard integrals, application to differential\nequations, area under curves, methods of substitution and integration by parts. Two tests were\nplanned with each one carrying a mark of 10 per cent. It was decided to give the students the use\nof the program in Practice mode so that they could see if they had errors as they went along.\nThe second class of about 150 science and engineering undergraduates took a course which\ncovers topics in the theory and application of differentiation and aspects of complex numbers.\nIn this second class only one computer test was set carrying a credit of 10 per cent of the\nmodule mark. Questions were set with one, two or three key steps. A student who could answer\nthe question in the required number of steps could do so and move to the next question.\nHowever, each key step could be broken down into at most a further three sub-steps and the\nstudent who chose to tackle the question by answering every sub-step could score partial credit\nas the part answers are supplied. However, this had to be balanced in a timed summative test\nwhen the overall time to complete the examination is fixed. Clearly the design of the key-steps\nand sub-sets was critical in ensuring that students who could not tackle the entire question could\nget as much credit as they deserved for the parts they could do.\n30\nALT-J Volume 7 Number I\nTowards an online examination for mathematics\nIt is now possible in a mathematical test to resolve the main difficulties of examining a student\nusing the computer to set and mark the test. The use of random parameters in each question\nensures that each student receives a test of similar standard, but cheating is impractical since\nneighbouring screens will carry different versions of the same question and hence will have\ndifferent answers.\nThe design of the Input Tool has minimized the misinterpretation between student and\ncomputer. Moreover, the Input Tool carries an excellent syntax checker so that students are\nguided to form meaningful expressions. The Input Tool creates a dynamic display which\nprovides immediate visual feedback on how the computer is understanding the student's input.\nAs in many other testing situations if the student has practised with the use of the Input Tool\nthen the questions asked on the day of the test hold little fear.\nIt is in the area of partial credit that most advances have been made. Through the design of\nquestions and the introduction of key-steps, the less confident students can choose to take the\nquestion in smaller steps whereas the confident, careful student can move through a question\nmore rapidly. Partial answers in the wrong format can carry some credit and some correct\nanswers from a list can also be rewarded in part. Finally, the ability to deal with answers which\nare not correct can to some extent be done using key-steps and sub-steps.\nSo what remains to stop the creation of an on-line test remotely on demand? The assurance that\nthe person sitting the test is the person they say they are! Such security issues remain the major\nstumbling-block to the setting and marking of a test remotely by computer. Some progress in\ndealing electronically with the issue of security is possible. Students can be screened by name,\nlocation and machine and, provided there is some validation of an individual's identity by a\nhuman checker, then an examination can be delivered. Answers can be recorded and updated at\nevery input to prevent loss of results by electronic breakdown and results can be encrypted if\nnecessary. It may be that the use of a video camera together with image\u00abprocessing techniques\ncan combine to remove even this restriction in the future (Daugman, 1997).\nReferences\nAppleby, J., Samuels P. and Treasure-Jones, T.
