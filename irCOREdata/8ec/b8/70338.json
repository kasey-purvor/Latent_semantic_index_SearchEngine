Though the common conception of human-computer interfaces is one \nof screens and keyboards, the emergence of ubiquitous computing envisions \ninterfaces that will spread from the desktop into our environments. This gives \nrise to the development of novel interaction devices and the augmentation of \ncommon everyday objects to serve as interfaces between the physical and the \nvirtual. Previous work has provided exemplars of such everyday objects \naugmented with interactive behaviour. We propose that richer opportunities \narise when collections of everyday objects are considered as substrate for \ninterfaces. In an initial case study we have taken clothes hangers as an example \nand augmented them to collectively function as an information display. \n1 Introduction \nThe graphical user interface, commonplace on desktops and mobile computers, has \nbeen criticized as being too detached from the architectural spaces and physical \nartefacts around which people\u2019s activities evolve. Under headings such as ubiquitous \ncomputing, pervasive computing, and ambient intelligence, alternative approaches are \ninvestigated that move the interface from the desktop into the environment. One \nemerging possibility is to augment physical artefacts that already surround us so that \nthey become the interface to an otherwise invisible computing infrastructure. Previous \nwork has produced a range of examples in which everyday artefacts have been \naugmented with interactive behaviour while retaining their original purpose. These \ninclude a picture frame augmented as a context display [1], a table enabled as pointing \ndevice [2], and a chest of drawers affording digital lookup of physical content [3]. \nIn this paper, we go beyond the consideration of individual artefacts as interface \nobjects and propose a new type of interface that is based on sets of everyday, physical \nartefacts that collectively provide interactive behaviour. There are two main reasons \nto explore this approach. First, many artefacts naturally exist in collections (e.g., CDs, \ncutlery) and in arrangements (e.g., chairs around a table, pictures on a mantel), a fact \nthat can be taken advantage of for composing interfaces. Second, collections afford \nadditional interactions such as adding, removing, and arranging component artefacts.  \nInterfaces composed of individual physical entities are of course not a new \nconsideration \u2013 interfaces spanning multiple devices have been studied widely in \ntraditional user interface research, and there is also a range of examples of tangible \ninterfaces that use the arrangement of physical components as an interaction \nmechanism (e.g. Triangles [4] and the Urp interface [5]). However, the distinct \nnovelty in considering collections of everyday artefacts as interfaces is that the \ncomponent artefacts are individually meaningful entities to start with. This gives rise \nto a host of questions, such as when is an artefact part of an interface and when not, \nand how can an interface be made robust against any changes in composition that may \nresult from everyday use of component artefacts. \nTo explore this new interface concept we have focussed on a concrete case study as \na starting point. Our approach was to go through the complete process of designing an \nexample interface, of implementing the design as working prototype, and of engaging \nusers with the built prototype to collect formative feedback in addition to our design \nexperience. The example that we have investigated is a Hanger Display. We learned \nsome lessons designing and formatively evaluating the Hanger Display: that existing \nstructures can be useful in defining the interface scope of collections, and that \ninterfaces composed of everyday artefacts must be resilient to change. \n2 Design and Implementation of the Hanger Display  \nThe Hanger Display is a generic system for portraying information at the periphery of \nattention. As shown in Figure 1, the Hanger Display consists of a row of hangers, \neach augmented with a display element (e.g. a light emitting diode, LED), placed on a \nrod (e.g. in a wardrobe). Collectively the hangers function as a simple display defined \nby the array of display elements arranged along the rod. The hangers have individual \nmeaning in everyday activity, in the sense that individual hangers are used \nindependently of the state of other hangers (e.g. to hang up a coat, or to move it from \none wardrobe to another). But as display elements, they are only meaningful as part of \nthe collection of hangers placed together on the rod. \nFrom an interaction design perspective we think of the Hanger Display as being \nuseful for portraying information that may be relevant to the activities involving \nhangers (such as hanging and selecting clothes, morning rituals, and getting ready for \nthe day). For example, the hanger display could portray a sense of the day\u2019s expected \nhigh temperature: given a 0 \u2013 100\u00b0 F range, if 7 of 10 hangers were lit this would \nrepresent 70\u00b0 F. However, the Hanger Display does not prescribe how information is \nmapped onto the variable collection of display elements; it is entirely open-ended for \ndifferent display purposes. For instance, the hangers may convey any relative \nquantities (as in the temperature example), progress over time (e.g. in a reminder \nFigure 1: Desi  \ndisplay elemen \ngn Sketch of the Hanger Display. Each of the hangers is augmented with a\nt, and all hangers arranged on the rod together function as a coherent display.   \ndisplay that counts down days before an important event), or trend information (e.g. \nanalogous to how a barometer displays trends in weather conditions).  \nWe have implemented a working prototype of the Hanger Display based on the \nfollowing set of components: \n\u2022 Ordinary hangers augmented with very low-cost embedded hardware \n(an LED, and a switch to control the LED). \n\u2022 Hanger rods augmented with a physical network medium to provide \nconnectivity to the hangers. \n\u2022 Software to manage the display system, i.e. determining which hangers \nare present on a rod and controlling communication in the system. \n\u2022 Software mapping an input to the LED output of the Hanger Display, \ni.e. determining which hangers to turn on and sending commands. \nTwo aspects are particularly noteworthy in this implementation. First, rods have a \ndistinct role in the design as defining the scope of a display (i.e. determining which \nartefacts are part of the display and which are not). This is directly reflected in the \nimplementation by foreseeing rods as a connection medium for hangers, in which \nphysical arrangement is overlaid with digital connectivity. Second, the \nimplementation allows the display to be dynamic. Hangers can be removed or inserted \nwithout causing the display to break. Instead, the displayed information is re-mapped \nwhen the physical composition of the display changes. \nFigure 2 shows a photo of the implemented prototype and an illustration of its \nhardware components. The rod has two strips of aluminium along its length that act as \ntwo wires, enabling its use as a network medium. One strip serves as ground and the \nother provides data and power transmission, using the MicroLAN protocol [6] and a \nsimilar networking concept as presented by the Pin&Play project [7]. In order to \nconnect a hanger to this medium, we put two loops of wire around its hook so that \nseparate contacts are made to the two aluminium strips on the rod. The balance of a \nhanger, with or without clothing, generally causes it to naturally fall into the correct \nplace on the rod to make these contacts. The hardware on each hanger includes a \nswitch that can be controlled over MicroLAN, an LED whose output is directly \nconnected to the state of the switch, and a resistor to achieve brighter output. The               \nFigure 2: A wardrobe augmented with two built-in Hanger Displays (the top and bottom\nrods). As detailed on the right, hangers have two wires added that contact the rod through\nwhich data and power is provided to the LED and the switch (hidden under black tape). \nHanger Display software is written in Java. Based on the MicroLAN protocol, it \nprovides core functionality to control the display system, such as detecting which \nhangers are present on the rod and addressing hangers in order to control the LEDs. \nNote that the hardware components are all very small and do not compromise the \nform-factor of the hangers in any significant way. In addition, despite the fact that \nonly very simple and inexpensive hardware is used for each hanger, the collection of \nhangers is quite expressive in the way it conveys information. \n3 Formative User Study and Discussion \nIn order to obtain formative user feedback we implemented two basic application \nscenarios in which weather-related information was displayed on the Hanger Display. \nThe applications mapped temperature forecast and the probability of rain to the two \nrods of our prototype, based on local weather data parsed from the weather.com web \nsite. The intent of this application setup was not to evaluate how effective weather \ninformation might be conveyed by such a display, but to engage users in a more \ngeneral discussion on the use of multiple everyday artefacts as an interface. \nTo this end, we conducted a formative, in-lab user study with the two applications. \nWe set up a wardrobe as in Figure 2: the top rod displaying the predicted high \ntemperature (the range is 0 \u2013 30\u00b0 C and the figure shows 4 of 8 hangers are lit, so it \nwill be 15\u00b0 C), and the bottom rod showing the chance of rain (2 of 3 hangers lit, \nindicating a 66% chance of rain). Seven researchers from other groups at our \ndepartment came to the lab for one individual evaluation session each with one of the \nauthors. Participants were given a brief description of the applications and asked to \nexplore and interact with the interface with no specific task. An interview followed, in \nwhich the participants were asked for qualitative feedback on the interface. Although \nfeedback was influenced by the participants\u2019 previous computing experience, \ndiscussions primarily centred on domestic rather than work experience. \nThe feedback from the formative evaluation showed that there is a realistic use for \ndisplays and more generally interfaces composed of multiple everyday, physical \nartefacts. Every user had ideas for other applications that they would find useful in \ntheir own homes. For example, a collection of CDs could be augmented to give you a \nsense of which CDs you have not listened to recently. When you pick out music, you \nThe exciting prospect for examples like these is that they point to new, creative, \nand useful applications of ubiquitous computing that support activities in situ. Several \nusers pointed out the benefit of an everyday object like hangers displaying additional \ninformation: \u201cI like having information in the place where it is useful, so it is nice to \nget weather information when you are picking out clothes.\u201d With further exploration, \nother collections of everyday objects might suggest new ways to provide the benefits \nof technology without sacrificing the ease and naturalness of everyday activities. \nThe formative feedback also helped confirm some design considerations for \ninterfaces composed of multiple everyday, physical artefacts. The first consideration \nis that existing structures can be useful in defining interface scope. For the Hanger \nDisplay, the natural affordances of the rod made it easy for users to understand the \ninterface and to determine which hangers were part of it.  \nThe second consideration is that interfaces composed of everyday artefacts must be \nresilient to change. Aside from some problems with the prototype implementation \n(e.g., hangers not always making a connection with the rod), the users asserted that \nthe embedded technology did not interfere with natural interaction. The Hangers show \nwe can design to deal with physical re-composition, but future work is needed to \ninvestigate how this can be supported in a general way. \n4 Conclusion \nIn this paper, we have presented a case study of an interface composed of a \ncollection of everyday artefacts, which attempts to provide information in the context \nof everyday activities and environments. The design of and formative feedback on the \nHanger Display shows that this approach is interesting for two main reasons: many \nartefacts naturally exist in collections; and collections afford additional interactions \nsuch as adding, removing, and arranging of component artefacts. When designing \nsuch interfaces, we learned that existing structures can be useful in defining interface \nscope, and that interfaces composed of everyday artefacts must be resilient to change.  \nReferences \n1.
