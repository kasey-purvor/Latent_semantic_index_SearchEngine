The paper discusses the need for\nimprovement in UK local government children\u2019s services and then offers a review of the\ndialogue based inquiry approaches. In so doing, the paper highlights the Socratic mode of\ninquiry, emphasising the dual strategies of penetrative questioning, elenchus, and the process of\nfounding new knowledge through working through confusion, aporia. This paper then reports\nhow a London borough realised sustained change through the adoption of deliberative inquiry.\nThe study achieved successful integration through the penetrating and contextually sensitive\ndialogue the inquiry participants generated, allowing them to develop the capability for realising\neffective organisational change. The paper concludes that deliberative inquiry facilitates\nindividuals to speak their concerns in a manner that prompts \u2018consensually accepted beliefs\u2019 to\nemerge through paying equal attention to the motivation of the inquiry participants, as well as to\nthe reality of the contextual demands they need to confront.\nKey Words: Deliberative inquiry, Children\u2019s services, Socratic deliberation, Integrated ways of\nworking\nIntroduction\n3Local government within the UK has experienced considerable fluctuation concerning its role,\nmission structure and organisation (McEldowney, 2003). Yet, in embracing the challenge of\nchange, public service strategies have been predominately evolutionary rather than revolutionary,\nas their focus has been on improving the quality of existing services rather than expanding the\nservice and channel to market\/citizen offering (Ajay, 2010). Despite its evolutionary nature, the\nneed for flexibility within the public services is as strong as ever. From the expansion of service\ndelivery channels, to changes in internal working practices, to integrated ways of working across\nthe agencies, to partnerships with private-sector organisations, the focus has shifted from what\npublic sector agencies do to how the organisation should run for the benefit of multiple\nstakeholders. Further, bottom-line objectives increasingly drive decisions that departments and\nagencies and their administration make, with problem-solving officials increasingly replacing the\npublic servant bureaucrat (Kakabadse and Kakabadse, 2007). Research shows that numerous\nchange initiatives such as privatisation, downsizing and fundamental reorganisation, spawning a\n\u2018more for less\u2019 culture, have also seriously damaged the employment relationship between public\nsector employees and their employers, resulting in a loss of trust between managers and staff and\nlow levels of motivation, job satisfaction and morale (van Ruitenbeck and Makin, 1999; KPMG,\n2010). Hence, finding new and more effective ways of managing change are mandatory if\norganisations are to avoid further damage to public sector employees\u2019 morale and ultimately, to\nthe services that they deliver (van Ruitenbeck and Makin, 1999). \u2018Against a backdrop of low\nmorale, reduced budgets, growing complexity and underlying change\u2019 (KPMG, 2010: 8), public\nservices are now facing new challenges such as short-term cost reduction and efficiency\nimprovement and in the long-term, redefining the role of the public sector. \u2018What it (public\nservice agencies) should be doing and what it should stop doing because it is no longer\n4affordable\u2019 (KPMG, 2010: 8) is the mantra of today, implying not only the cutting of expenses,\nimproving efficiency, but also initiating strategic or radical transformation that includes\nidentifying new funding sources (an initiative agencies have not yet realised).\nChange has been a perennial organisational theme dating back to the ancient Greeks, and perhaps\nearlier. Some 2500 years ago, Heraclitus (1991) coined the maxim that \"there is nothing\npermanent except change\u201d, holding that there is no permanent reality beyond that of change. The\nChinese reflect their understanding of change in the term for \"crisis\", in Mandarin, \u201cwei-ji \u201c,\nwhich comprises the characters for \"danger\" (\u201cwei\u201d) and \"opportunity\" (\u201cji\u201d), (Ming-Jer Chen,\n2002). In more modern times, change has become the management mantra, and since the mid-\n1980s a myriad of books and bourgeoning academic and popular literature (Kakabadse et al,\n2007) reflect this. Public service has adopted numerous theories of organisational change for the\npublic sector under the umbrella of new public management (NPM), (CAPAM, 2005; Bertucci,\n2006; Siegel and Rasmussen, 2008).\nEffective communication (Kakabadse et al 2009) is critical to the effective adoption of change\nmethodologies. Organisational leaders are in constant search mode for the best communication\npractices within and across shifting organizational boundaries. Collaboration and integrated ways\nof service delivery, now more than ever, require that we collect and seek information and\nopinion in order to ensure that we make the most appropriate decisions that are aligned with the\nvision and direction that we are already pursuing. In support, Gergen, (1994: 264) for example\nargues that \u2018it is human interchange that gives language its capacity to mean, and it must stand as\nthe critical locus of concern\u2019. It is through human utterances that issues, biases and sentiments\n5are surfaced, examined, confronted and dissolved which in so doing surface new issues.\nKakabadse at al. (2007) posited that within collaborative inquiring groups, personal (concrete)\nlevels of experience are lived and continuously re-negotiated (Kakabadse at al., 2007). Thus\ncommunication that engages is particularly relevant in sensitive public service sectors, such as\nchildren\u2019s services, where the free flow of information is crucial to ensure that agencies take\ncorrect actions.\nIn fact, the urgency for change and improved communication practice across organisational\nboundaries is a particular concern for children\u2019s services in the UK. Over the last two decades,\nthe government has intensely scrutinised the protection of vulnerable children within the UK due\nto the number of child abuse cases and loss of child life which have been documented in a\nnumber of public inquiries into the perceived failure of public organisations (SSSS, 1974; DHSS,\n1982; DH, 2002; DfES, 2003; Laming, 2003). Such scrutiny has also highlighted a particular\nconcern over the increasingly prescriptive managerial approaches and the increasing incidence of\napparent child care failures (Buttrick, 2000). With the publication of the green paper, Every\nChild Matters (DfES, 2003; HMSO, 2004), the government countered prescriptive\nmanagerialism with a requirement for the more flexible multi-agency cooperation. The green\npaper stated that each local authority should appoint a children\u2019s service director to lead the\nintegration of multi agency children\u2019s services, as well as the development of the new trust\norganisation which will take over the chief education officers\u2019 and the social services directors\u2019\nstatutory responsibilities. It also required that a local authority must also appoint a lead\ncouncillor to take political responsibility for children\u2019s services.\n6Although since the 1980s the government has encouraged professionals in local authorities, such\nas schools and health services, to collaborate (Davies, 1999), it has recognised the failure of\nformal collaboration across local authority institutions charged with the protection of children.\nThe failure between agencies and professionals to build crucial links concerning information\nflows and complimentary actions is unsatisfactory, and leads to notably high profile cases of\nchild abuse (Laming, 2003; Milburn, 2002; Clode, 2004). In response to the public outcry,\ngovernment introduced an initiative, The Children\u2019s Trust, with the mandate to enforce the\nintegration of professions into a single accountable organisation (HMSO, 2004).\nAgainst this backdrop, this paper presents the case of how one London borough embraced the\nchallenge of integration and change through a multi-agency deliberative inquiry process.\nReflecting back, an assumption was made, namely that \u201cprofessionals\u201d in local authorities, such\nas local councils, schools and health services, hold the potential to drive through meaningful\nchange in children-services practice, because of their capacity to both act upon their professional\njudgement, as well as their self-discipline and courage. However, other stakeholders such as\nchildren, parents or taxpayers in general,, were not called upon to participate in this inquiry. As\nthis was an internally determined inquiry, driven by the objective of realising organisational\nintegration, it was recognised that instrumental reasoning (or the applying of general principles)\nhad to be subsumed by practical reasoning (phronesis), or common sense\/prudence in order to\nprovide for a service of high intrinsic value. Hence, the concern was to go beyond epistemic or\n\"scientific\" (Aristotle\u2019s episteme) inquiry with its focus on knowledge, belief, acceptance,\nverification, justification, and perspective, to \u201cphronetic\u201d (Aristotle's phronesis or practical\n7wisdom) inquiry with a focus on deliberation particulalryparticularly concerning which social\nactions can be judged good or bad (Flyvbjerg, 2001), which in this case was the actions to be\ntaken by the professionals in the provisions of children services. Thus, the borough in question\nadopted the Socratic approach to change as the most appropriate mode of action-based inquiry\nmethod. The reason for this is that the Socratic notion of deliberative dialogue serves as a sound\nframework for in vivo enhancement of learning, thus nurturing meaningful change. With such in\nmind tThis paper provides the background to the notion of integrated ways of working within\nUK children\u2019s services. The paper next presents a detailed account of the Socratic, deliberative\ndialogue mode of action inquiry. Highlighting the suitability of adopting Socratic philosophy to\nexamine the organisational integration requirements within children\u2019s services, the paper offers\ncomparative scrutiny of dialogue based inquiry approaches. It next presents a case study inquiry\ninto a London borough children\u2019s services department. The paper concludes with the authors\u2019\nfindings that the Socratic interpretation of deliberative inquiry assisted the inquiry participants to\nembrace consensually accepted beliefs concerning professional practice, as the inquiry\nparticipants found the confidence and skill to speak as individuals, and as a result, clarified\npathways through dialectical contrast.\nThe Socratic Method of Inquiry\nSocratic dialogue has invoked inspiration and guidance for many contemporary scholars, not\nonly those in philosophy and politics, but also from other disciplines such as education and\npsychology, irrespective of whether their aim has been to find the truth (i.e. truth seekers) or\npursue open inquiry about their world (Table 1). Socrates drew on deliberative dialogue as the\nmethod of inquiry, positing that the inquirer was enabled to seek truth above all things. The\n8essence of the Socratic argument is that deliberative dialogue deploys a consistent pedagogical\napproach by means of two particular strategies - the elenchus, or questioning method, and\ninspiring aporia, or confusion (Seeskin, 1986; Vlastos, 1991; 1993). His questioning technique,\nor the elenchus (i.e. refute or cross-examine), drew Socrates' interlocutors into common inquiry \u2013\nthe process that led to the recognition that the interlocutors\u2019 beliefs required revision. Socrates\nalleged that knowing oneself to be uninformed is a far better state of affairs than possessing\nuntrue beliefs. Recognition of being uniformed allows the person to release oneself of false\nbeliefs that constrain reason and prevent learning. By probing each response of an interlocutor,\nexamining whether one\u2019s entire set of beliefs are mutually consistent, the elenchus questioning\nbreaks down old assumptions in order to build up new insights (Robinson, 1971; Vlastos, 1993).\nThus, although the natural outcome of the elenchus is aporia, or confusion, more importantly,\naporia arouses curiosity in the Socratic interlocutor who, being robbed of the certainty of his\/her\nprevious beliefs, recognises that he\/she must begin searching anew. New learning can then take\nplace as once one reaches a state of aporia, Socrates and his fellow inquirers stood on common\nground, not pretending to possess ultimate knowledge or truth, but ready to engage in a\ncollective search through further dialogue. In a similar vein, Schleiermacher (1998) argued that\nmethods of natural science cannot accomplish the interpretation of human action as we must\nunderstand the human act as the act of a free subject, motivated by reason, and understood\nthrough dialogue.\nMany scholars have valued dialogue that invokes both high energy and levels of learning\n(Habermas, 1979; Forester, 1983; Jaworski, 1996). However, dialogue and discussion crucially\ndiffer. Within discussion participants hold relatively fixed positions and argue in favour of their\n9view, trying to convince others to change. In contrast, dialogue primarily requires the suspension\nof thought, impulse and judgment until a meaningful shared set of assumptions and insights\nemerge (Bohem, 1996).\nHowever, deliberative inquiry is only one mode of learning through deliberation. Many\napproaches within the action learning umbrella exist (Reason and Bradbury, 2006; Kakabadse et\nal, 2007), such as action learning (Revans, 1997), action research (Toulmin and Gustavsen, 1996;\nGustavsen, 2003; Flyvbjerg, 2001), action inquiry (Torbert, 2001), appreciative inquiry\n(Cooperrider and Whitney, 2005), and deliberative dialogue (Forester, 1999; Yankelovich, 2001;\nLondon, 2005), amongst other possibilities. The UK Civil Service, for example, has effectively\nused collaborative inquiry (CI) (Bray et al, 2000), (Kakabadse and Kakabadse, 2002) and the\nBritish National Health Service (NHS; Childerstone et al, 2004) has tried \u2018reflection in action\u2019\n(Reynolds, 1999; Raelin, 2001; 2002) with success.\nOn the basis that not knowing what one does not know limits understanding and increases error,\nby entering into an exercise where one tries to find out what one doesn\u2019t know, one builds\nfoundations for a better informed understanding and by implication, allows one to make more\n\u2018effective\u2019 decisions. Towards this end, Yankelovich (2001:41) championed Socratic dialogue\nas the way to migrate from discussion to dialogue, as in discussion, participants usually shy away\nfrom other participants\u2019 innermost assumptions in order not to violate unwritten rules of civility.\nHowever, in dialogue, participants uninhibitedly bring their own and other participants'\nassumptions into the open, \u2018as in the safe confines of dialogue others can respond without\nreacting judgmentally\u2019. Although deliberative dialogue is a form of discourse aimed at finding\n10\nthe best course of action (Yankelovich, 2001; London, 2005), Yankelovich recognised that\nindividuals and groups need to develop the capability for dialogue. In Ancient Greece, although\nsociety viewed deliberation as the process of establishing intent and resolve before settling on a\nspecific course of action, they also recognised that interlocutions needed to mature into more\nsophisticated forms of conversation (Yankelovich, 2001). Since then, generations of scholars\nhave affirmed the gain that can be realised through adopting Socratic dialogue as long as\nparticipants are allowed to actively develop.

Rather, he searches for it through inquiry along with his interlocutors (Socrates,\n1961: Apology, 21b; Euthyphro, 5a-c; Gorgias, 506a; 508e; Republic I, 337e). For example, in\nCharmides, Socrates (1961: 165b) replies to the astonished Critias, \u201cYou come to me as though I\nprofessed to know about the questions which I ask, as though I could, if I only would, agree with\nyou. Whereas the fact is that I am inquiring with you into the truth of that which is advanced\nfrom time to time, just because I do not know\u201d.\nSocratic inquiry powerfully illustrates the ideal of constant openness and eagerness to enter into\ndeliberation with others, whilst simultaneously holding expectations that from such dialogue,\nparticipants will not establish the final truth. Rather, emergent learning will provide the\nopportunity for a common consensus amongst the inquiring participants (Seeskin, 1986). In\neffect, Socratic reflexive praxis provides a meaningful way for participants to gain genuine\nunderstanding through processes that \u201cinvolves first, a state of doubt, hesitation, perplexity and\nmental difficulty from which thinking originates, and second, an act of searching, hunting, and\ninquiring to find material that will resolve the doubt and settle and dispose perplexity\u201d (Dewey,\n1933: 12), whilst still allowing participants to evaluate the significance of their experiences\nwithin their context (Gustavsen, 1992). That is, \u201conly when people can communicate on free and\n12\nequal terms can they achieve the deep self-understanding that we have hankered after since the\nenlightenment\u201d (Dewey, 1933: 12).\nThus, Socratic dialogue is attractive for the purposes of modelling common inquiry and for\naligning group and civic participation. The Socratic method offers both the pedagogical potency\nto develop analytical skills and the inquiring habit that is invaluable for engagement to achieve\nmeaningful change (Seeskin, 1986). Reich (1998: 222) argues that the \u201cSocratic method is\nimportant less for its drive at \u2018moral education\u2019 than for its capacity to further \u2018civic education\u2019\u201d.\nAlthough , the Socratic dialogue ideal is not always achievable, the Socratic, Maieutics\nprinciple., (definition and induction) of penetrating interchange between individuals with\nopposing viewpoints through the asking and answering of questions to stimulate critical thinking\nin order to search fortease out commonly held truths that shape opinion, encourages an enduring\nscrutiny. Through engaging in Socratic discussions, the individual can become more adept at\ncritical thinking, improve their listening skills, learn to better articulate thoughts and ideas, and,\nas a result become more tolerant of diverse opinions (Ronald, 1992).\nOverall, one can argue that all epistemologies fall in one of the two basic categories, namely\nSocratic or Aristotelian. One can interpret the Aristotelian approach towards deliberative\ndialogue as too theoretical in an effort to try to neutralise emotions, passions and identities in the\nname of rational reasoning and the enabling of logic for better argument (Fischer, 2009:82:272-\n94). Aristotelian epistemology takes a teleological position, emphasising cause and end or goals,\nand as such, is motivated towards the discovery of truth and knowledge, through the search for\n13\nunderlying principles. In this sense, Aristotelian epistemology relies on a shared rationality and\nobjectivity, leading to \u201cscientific\u201d knowledge rather than \u201cpractical\u201d knowledge.\nDeliberative Inquiry\nBy embracing the Socratic principles of facilitating self audit and self development, deliberative\ninquiry is a dynamic process which sets out to accommodate participants holding different\nperspectives. Deliberation played an important role in ancient Athens because it was\ninstrumental to the exercise of democracy. Some 2400 years ago, Socrates used deliberation as a\nmethod for seeking deeper understanding - a way of seeking the truth through inquiry. Even at\nhis trial in 399 B.C., Socrates (Plato, 1997: 38a) urged his fellow citizens to examine their lives\nin elenchic conversations (elenchos-from the Greek term for refutation), maintaining that, \u201cthe\nunexamined life was not worth living\u201d. Such enthusiastic and vigorous debating became diluted\nover time and led to the rise of modern \u2018empiricism\u2019, championed by Francis Bacon. Philosphers\nfavoured rational empiricism and experimentation over deliberation, which currently dominate in\nour search for knowledge in world science. Francis Bacon expounded scientific\nexperimentalism, believing that we must force Nature to answer the questions put to her as\n\u201cNature exposes herself more rapidly when she is tortured than when she is free \u2026 Nature needs\nto be constrained, tortured, forced out of her natural state by the hand of man, squeezed and\nmoulded\u201d (Sir Francis Bacon quoted in Merchant, 1982: 169). Seventeenth century Baconian\nmethods still dominate much of modern scientific research. Bacon\u2019s ideas set in the\nAdvancement of Learning in 1605, propagated his description of science as a four-stage process\nof observation, induction, deduction and experimentation, a platform that has dominated science\nfor the last 400 years.\n14\nUnder such onslaught, deliberative inquiry faded. However, the Socratic art of dialogue and\nPlato\u2019s dialectical logic (Cooper and Hutchinson, 1997) resurfaced in the 18th century, first\nresuscitated by Kant (1929), then expanded on by Hegel (1806\/1975) and ultimately, the German\nscientists Von Goethe and Naydler (1996) revived the Socratic method of inquiry. Better known\nas a poet (author of Faust), Goethe (1987) was also a scientist who practiced a method he named\n\u2018zarte empirie\u2019 (delicate empiricism). More than a century later it reemerged as existential\nphenomenology (Van Manen, 1990). Existential phenomenology holds that the individual needs to\n\u2018stay with\u2019 the experience, which acts as the basis for generalisation and interpretation. Goethe's\ninterpretation of science moved away from quantitative, materialist approaches to life as nature and\nemphasised intimate firsthand encounters between the inquirer and the subject.\nGoethe\u2019s (1987) contribution was a significant step in the reawakening of deliberative inquiry.\nWith the increased pace of automatisation, measurement and the further disintegration of the\nworkplace (Karoly and Panis, 2004), scholars once again recognised the value of Socratic\ndeliberation\u2019s deep discussion, particularly between the mid-1960s and mid-1970s, under the\numbrella of action-based research. Sometimes explicitly acknowledged and sometimes just\nimplicitly inferred, Socratic dialogue acted as the basis of \u201ccommunicative action\u201d (Habermas,\n1985) and the myriad of action based inquiries, such as \u201cparticipative action research (PAR)\u201d,\n\u201cco-operative inquiry (CoI)\u201d, \u201ccollaborative inquiry (CI)\u201d, \u201cappreciative inquiry (AI)\u201d, clinical\ninquiry, community-based research, diagnostic practice, and reflective practice (Table 2). As\nsuch, scholars position deliberative dialogue as a \u201cpractical discipline\u201d rather than a\nhomogeneous theory (Craig, 1989) Its multidisciplinary nature transcends many fields of\n15\nspecialisation: philosophy, linguistics, political science, organizational development, psychology,\nsociology, education, social work, public relations, conflict resolution, communication theory,\nand with its practical orientation, provides a continuous bridge between theory and praxis, thus\nforming \u201dconversational hybrids\u201d (Barge and Little, 2002: 379; Stewart and Zediker, 2000;\nStewart et al, 2004). Creating space for deliberative dialogue and in turn, dialogic\ncommunication, is an evolving craft rather than a fixed technique. Deliberative dialogue requires\ndiscipline, time, and a willingness to reflect on communication habits and patterns of power\nrelationships, and simultaneously enables participant inquirers to experience different ways of\nrelating to others (Craig, 1989; Ryfe, 2002; 2005). Within deliberative practice, we understand\ntruth and knowledge as \u201cconsensually accepted beliefs\u201d within evolving conversations (Fischer,\n2003:131) which are grounded within a normative validity (Linder, 2001). Despite its emphasis\non the participant inquirer, there remains a need for skilful facilitators who must invest\nconsiderable time and energy in enthusing participants to discover common ground and\novercome language barriers which are often steeped in the legacy style and specialised jargon\nof the \u201cshared vocabularies\u201d of their networks (Miller and Rose, 2008:34-5). Facilitators assist\nthe inquiring group in the \u201cproblematisation and exploration of their own concerns and interests\u201d\n(Fischer, 2003:216).\nTable 2: Dialogue based inquiry approaches\nCharacteristics Deliberative\nInquiry\nCollaborative (and\/or\nCooperative) Inquiry\nParticipatory Action\nResearch\nPurpose To expand the understanding of\neach inquirer\u2019s own experience\nby understanding of self and other\ninquirers, and together to develop\nnew understanding of shared\nphenomena under inquiry.\nCreating shared meaning\n(co-creation of group\nknowledge) and change\nthrough learning.\nSocial transformation (re-\naddressing power\nimbalances).\nAim Awaking from dogmatic slumbers\ninto genuine curiosity and creation\nKnowledge co-creation for change within context.\n16\nof shared meaning (or consensus)\namongst all participants.\nOntological\nassumptions\nReality of the world of external\nnature and internally and socially\nconstructed interactions.\nReality is a unity of the natural and social world\n(objectively given), in which humans are participatory and\nself-determining (inter-subjectively interpreted).\nEpistemological\npositioning\nFocus on attainment of\nconsistency rather than certainty\n(i.e. epistemological humility).\nGenerative dance between four types of knowledge \u2013\nprepositional, practical, experimental and presentational.\nParadigm Perpetual learning (i.e. deliberative\ndiscovery).\nParticipatory (critical engagement).\nFocus Group of equal participants.

In so doing, it creates opportunities for participants to constantly reflect on their\nexperiences and learn. Whilst deliberative inquiry emphasises the process of deliberation itself, it\nis also concerned with examining and comparing different settings and procedures as well as the\nproblems and constraints that one cannot always anticipate by conceptual argument alone.\nFundamental to deliberative inquiry is democratic Socratic dialogue which, in addition to\nproviding a forum to cast issues \u2018in the open\u2019 or \u2018out there\u2019 into a public space, provides a forum\nto further explore their relational nature within a \u2018relational landscape\u2019, or in a \u2018dialogical space\nof possibilities\u2019 (Shotter and Katz, 1996) that we evoke in order to examine existing assumptions\nand create new and shared meanings. It is an ongoing flow of activity constituting new inquiring\ncycles based on mutual involvement from which participants emerge with a new understanding\nof what Wittgenstein (1980: 26) terms a \u201cproper synopsis\".\nDeliberative Inquiry\u2019s Background to the Integrated Ways of Working in Children\nServices\nAware of the pitfalls of previous government initiatives concerning prescribed change and\ncognisant of the literature that suggests that defensiveness (Mazen, 2002) and mistrust (Jaques,\n1976) prevail in inhibiting change, a London borough CEO embarked on a journey of change.\nFaced with task of establishing a children\u2019s trust (HMSO, 2004), and the responsibility to ensure\nthat the local council fulfils it statutory obligations and delivers appropriate service, the CEO\nconsidered a route to change through participatory action-based inquiry into how professionals in\nthe newly structured agency should work together. The CEO had long professional experience\nwithin the public sector and the informed assumption that ownership of change is essential for\nsuccess (Bazerman, 1986). He also knew, from his painful experience, that prescribed change\n18\ncan have a negative impact on the professional actor (Hunter, 1992). This CEO knew that\nnobody could take for granted the success of a collaborative team implementing change and\nemerging from a legacy local situation (King et al, 1993: 445). To assist with the inquiry\nprocess, the CEO enlisted two academics in the role of inquiring advisors. At the first meeting\nwith the advisors present, the inquiring CEO voiced his concern regarding the perceived\nchallenges he faced:\n\u201cThis is not a small change; it also implies a merger or a fusion of professional roles,\nresponsibilities and goals. \u2026 It also may imply removal, duplication or separate\naccountability, which may lead to some sort of re-codification of the way the job, is\nactually done. In addition, there is the issue of the skills and competencies needed to\nenable the new system to be put in place. My 30 years experience in the public sector has\ntaught me that a managerialistc prescriptive formula of change will not work. It never\nhas. I need to do something different, to engage people in a meaningful way, even if that\nis the last thing I do.\u201d\nSocratic deliberative inquiry appeared as a fitting approach for this project, bearing in mind the\nvarious inquiry methods within the action inquiry paradigm (Table 2). The Socratic method\nappeared the most relevant to the inquiry participants because they considered it sufficiently\nflexible to accommodate the participant inquierers\u2019 variety of views and contrasting\nphilosophies. Wilmot\u2019s (1995) study of clinical teams in hospitals revealed that \u2018dialogue\u2019\ninfluences success at hand. He found that \u201cdialogue facilitates discussion of team philosophy,\nvalues and shared approach to quality service provisions\u201d (Wilmot, 1995: 157). Similarly,\n19\nMcCallin\u2019s (2001: 281) research emphasised that when team members do not \u201cwell establish\ndialogue, service provisions deteriorate because they are unwilling to discuss and work through\ntheir differences and put clients into the centre\u201d. The CEO purposely embraced the decision to\nadopt deliberative inquiry as the mode of engagement for the inquiry group on the basis that they\n\u2018needed to step back and go back to basics\u2019 (Participant, 2). As an organisation, the agency had\nexperienced many upheavals, \u2018unsuccessfully\u2019 drawing on numerous methodologies and\nconsultant models. This time they were determined to use something \u2018very basic that works\u2019,\nwhich they concluded to be Socratic \"dialogue\u201d. A member\u2019s reading of Bohem (1996) further\naffirmed the group\u2019s decision, with the conclusion that dialogue is essentially a conversation\nbetween equals and that Socratic dialogue is an invitation for learning.\nOnce the group adopted deliberative inquiry, the CEO \u201cblended\u201d into the group\u2019s background\nand became one inquiring participant. This emerged as an important factor for the deliberative\nprocess and perhaps, a critical factor in the group\u2019s success. Experienced, charismatic, well\nknown and politically astute, the CEO had the \u2018gravitas\u2019 to take the group in any direction.\nHowever, his natural curiosity and will for learning had him position himself as a co-inquirer.\nThe Inquiry\nIn order to gain the participation of the relevant agencies for the inquiry, the CEO sent a letter of\ninvitation to a range of professionals involved in meeting children\u2019s needs in a particular\ngeographic part of London. Entitled \u201cNew Children\u2019s Service: Help us get it right\u201d, the letter\nexplained the inquiry\u2019s aim, namely, how to effectively integrate professional judgment and\ndecisions on behalf of improving services for children. The host inquiring group sought to elicit\n20\nparticipation across education, social care and health service, as well as the borough council\nconcerned and approached a vertical cross-section of staff \u2013 from strategic management to senior\noperational officers. Some 29 professionals responded positively and the CEO invited 15\nvolunteers to form a steering team, with the intention that they would, overtime, involve other\nservices, such as police, probation services and the voluntary sector in the project\u2019s second\nphase. The CEO initiated the inquiry in 2005, and it is still ongoing. In order to capture the\nexperience and possible benefit of drawing on deliberative inquiry as a mode for facilitating\nchange, this paper only touches upon issues which involve more complex ongoing changes in\none local authority and its related agencies.\nAt the first meeting, and in the spirit of forming a platform from which evaluative opinion would\nemerge, discussion focused on whether inquiring participants clearly understood deliberative\ninquiry. This first gathering enabled participants to \u2018get to know each other\u2019 and to explore the\nmeanings they attached to the current integrated ways of working.\nFour key themes emerged as requiring greatest attention for deliberation, namely, the meaning of\nintegration, recognition of the need for change, expectations from integrated ways of working\nand the \u2018real\u2019 issues.\nMeaning of Integration\nThe inquiring participant across the participating agencies concerning integration held a \u2018means\nrather than ends\u2019 interpretation.\n21\n\u201cIntegration is not the goal, but rather a means for achieving better services for children\nand their families.\u201d\nChild Care Unit Practice Manager, Social Services\n\u201cThere is a huge gap between the way in which we, as professionals, now work and\ncollaborate and the stated government vision for integrated service \u2013 realistically\nintegration means improving current ways of working.\u201d\nCommunity Paediatrician, Health Services\n\u201cIntegration means being able to help the child with the difficulties it faces when the time\nis right. It means a completely new way of working together and not focusing on meeting\ntargets for the sake of it.\u201d\nEducation Welfare Officer, Primary School\n\u201cFor me, integration means working as a real team.\u201d\nFinancial Manager, Borough Council\nThe inquiry participants expressed a shared vision of end user benefit from their greater\npursuit of integration of effort and collaboration across the relevant agencies. Notably, the\ncomment on targets reveals the nature of the underlying problems of how things were before\nand suggests that personal idiosyncrasies influencing performance may have, at one time,\nover taken real purpose.\n22\nAlso, each member held different views concerning the nature of integration but all agreed\nthat the agencies needed improvement.\nRecognition of Need for Change\nRequired to respond to an ever greater number of government initiatives for change, the inquiry\nparticipants expressed varying awareness levels to the unique nature of this particular\nprogramme of change, or the need for change in the first place. Only after some discussion, the\nparticipants started to verbalise their appreciation of the need for change to improve service\ndelivery.\n\u201cChildren\u2019s bill or not, sharing information amongst fellow professionals must happen,\nespecially between health and social services colleagues if we are to achieve\nimprovement on the current situation.\u201d\nSenior Social Worker, Social Services\n\u201cWe really need a much better way of working together, where we feel that we all have\nan equal say in the way decisions are taken.\u201d\nFinancial Manager, Borough Council\n23\n\u201cImprovements to the current service are necessary, but improvements through combined\nservices will not happen overnight \u2026 Changing people\u2019s ways of working, responding to\ncontinuous government initiatives and cutting costs are challenging tasks.\u201d\nHead Teacher, Secondary School\nSome two and a half months into the inquiry the collaborators were \u2018struck\u2019 by their increased\nawareness that their current practice required improvement and that their agency was considering\nnew ways of integrated practice.\nExpectations from Integrated Ways of Working\nBy reflecting on their existing practices and identifying areas of improvement, the inquiry\nparticipants shared their expectations for new ways of working, as well as their forming of\nhealthy doubts of the value of the inquiry.\n\u201cI am hoping for better outcomes for children, improved care and teamwork but, based\non my experience, I\u2019m not holding my breath.\u201d\nChild Care Unit Practice Manager, Social Services\n\u201cIntegration must achieve maximising resources, sharing information, a more cohesive\napproach, challenging, less political and more services responding to the actual needs.\u201d\nCommunity Paediatrician, Health Services\n24\n\u201cI hope that this process will reduce the number of complaints we receive, as well as help\nus quickly pinpoint problem areas.\u201d\nOfficer, Borough Council\nThe comments suggest that the inquiry participants were taking responsibility for service\nintegration across the relevant agencies. Their desire for a successful collaboration was\nbecoming embedded in the inquiry team\u2019s thinking.\nOne significant factor of deliberative inquiry is that once participants start sharing their thoughts\nand doubts, they become inquiry subjects themselves that others can examine. Once the issues\nare 'out there' in the common space between group members, these inquiry participants also\nfunction as a shared resource of already established topics, or shared common places that group\nmembers can draw upon and refer to in their deliberation. Thus, in addition to providing a forum\nto get issues \u2018in the open\u2019, dialogue also provides the space to further explore their relational\nnature within a \u2018relational landscape\u2019, in a \u201cdialogical space of possibilities\u201d (Shotter and Katz,\n1996) of experiential events, that participants evoke in order to create a shared knowledge.\nThe \u201cReal\u201d Issues\nBy nature, deliberative inquiry is an iterative process and as such the \u2018real\u2019 issues merged as a\ntopic of deliberation only during the 11th cycle. All discussed issues were important to the\nparticipants, as they formed an elaborative common platform for sharing. Wittgenstein (1980:\n26) terms this as \"a synopsis of trivialities\" that get enriched at each meeting, whereby the depth\nand openness of sharing became more evident cycle by cycle. The inquiry participants drew on a\n25\ncommunal \u201cspace of resources\u201d, creating what Taylor (1985: 264) refers to as \u201centre nous\u201d, a\nspace distinctive before them.\n\u201cIn a way this is a humbling experience, learning how to seek support and advice from\nmy peers. It both assures me, but at the same time it questions my professional\nconfidence.\u201d\nTeacher, Special Needs School\nDuring deliberative inquiry, participants create a common ground in which they recognise,\naccept and value each contributions\u2019 uniqueness. The diversity in perspectives, identities and\npotential contribution ensures a broad problem definition, creativity and completeness in\ngenerating solution alternatives. This legitimises the chosen strategy, and creates the energy and\ncommitment for implementation and finally, the governance of the deliberative system.\nAfter the first year of the inquiry, the group not only formed a blueprint identifying how the\nprofessionals themselves saw the new interaction patterns within the Trust, but were also acting\nas an integrated team. In fact, the participating members of one of the 37 local authorities in the\npilot wave assessing integrated ways of working, felt confident that government would positively\nassess their effort during spring 2006. Whilst one can fabricate target results that others set (Ball,\n2003), the participants felt that they had achieved their aim by considerably reducing, if not\neliminating, the defensiveness (Mazen, 2002) and mistrust (Jaques, 1976) that often prevails and\n26\ninhibits change initiatives. Based on reasoned, open, reciprocal and deliberated communication,\nthe inquiry participants reached an understanding on how to coordinate their future activities\nthrough normative commitments. Their normative agreement served as a social building block,\nbased on deliberated communication rather than manipulation or coercion.\n\u201cPerhaps we are not the most innovative group of people, but our new way of working is\ngrounded in the needs of the service users - children and their family. We now have\ncreated a model of information exchange that will enable us to make informed and timely\ndecisions. Most importantly, we know how to work with each other.\u201d\nEducation Welfare Officer, Education\nDiscussion\nAlthough deliberative inquiry cannot claim universal truth, deliberative inquiry results hold\ncontextual and ecological validity because its strength of pluralism in a multi-cultural society,\nwith widely varying accounts of work and life issues, enables individuals and groups to confront\nand act upon their reality. Considering that no one conclusively possesses the best ways of\ndealing with an issue, then only a systematic deliberation of all participants may lead the way in\nfinding discovering the best and most beneficial way forward within each context. Thus,\ndeliberative inquiry offers critical examination of beliefs and emotions so as to discover\nappropriate pathways through constant openness and eagerness to enter into dialogue with others\n(Reich, 1998). The Socratic method does not offer an inversely valid solution or generalisable\n27\nresults, but rather can powerfully help practitioners acquire the critical thinking skills and habits\nnecessary for active involvement in a pluralist and multi-faceted work context.\nThe inquiry participants in the children services study evolved to discover the benefits of\ninvesting in this wider accommodation of views. It did not happen instantly, but developed over\na number of cycles, as participants established trust and familiarity. Participants did not \u201cbattle\nout\u201d different agendas and even different understandings of integration. Instead, they shared\nviews and experiences and this resulted in reaching a collective direction to improve the service\nfor the end user rather than abuse the arena to strengthen individual member cause. Through\nactive involvement, collaborative interaction subsumed potential power relationships (Kakabadse\nand Parker, 1984). Further, the qualitative data the inquirers gathered fresh from the collective\nenvironment could not accurately represent any scientific gain in detail. Rather, it provided an\nindication of events and intentions on a cumulative basis and noted the pluralist evolution. Luke\nand White (1985: 25) suggest that \u201ccommunicatively competent actors have the capacity not\nonly to dispose reflectively \u2026.. but also to raise the respective types of validity claims in their\nown speech acts as well as to evaluate critically the claims made in the speech acts of others\u201d, in\nrelation to truth or success (i.e. assertions about a world of objects and states of affairs),\nlegitimacy (i.e. a world of social norms) and truthfulness or authenticity (i.e. a world of\nsubjectivity). Being accessible, easily grasped and linked to commonly understood truthful\nnorms appeals to those who desire to improve practice (Sutton, 2001). This spirit was clearly\npresent in the study where participants showed the benefits of pursuing this line of working\ntogether, both as a whole benefit and as an individual gain.\n28\nThe desire to improve practise has to be a key element in the portfolio of skills and attitudes of\nthe modern leader. The chief executive of the local authority in question had that desire and was\nwilling to risk putting the practise into place to improve matters in children services. In pursuit of\nthe highest levels of effectiveness in order to furnish their overall strategic aims, leaders in the\ncurrent competitive markets would benefit from ensuring that they are in a position to make the\nmost appropriate decisions at ground level through designing their strategic aims to suit the\ncurrent environment. The further the leader is from the front line of his\/her service or business,\nthe harder it is for them to make accurate decisions from the management information he\/she\nreceives. The free flow of current and actual experience is essential from those who are more\nfront facing. They must merge the quality data with the strategic minds that decide the way\nforward, as well as the methods of arriving there.\nIn addition to making the organisation responsive to its end users, there are positive by-products\nof the process in human terms. If leaders are more willing to allow the time to design a forum for\ndebate, they not only perpetually enlighten themselves, but also the participants, as this inquiry\nstudy reports. Further, the self continuity of the process accelerates in that once the culture\naccommodates this manner of cross organisational dialogue and importantly, the accompanying\nmutual respect for all inputs and the constant questioning and review of practise, the organisation\nis reinvigorated from its core. This gives the whole entity the proactive, perceptive power to\nsucceed in the long term and reduces the need for the panic reactivity for short term survival, as\nwell as the end user\u2019s risk of the agency short changing him\/her of a vital service.\n29\nRyfe\u2019s (2002:369) analysis of sixteen cases of deliberative discourse illustrates that \u2018there is no\nsuch thing as one form or format of good discourse. Deliberation is inherently rooted in context,\nand different kinds of contexts demand different kinds of conversations\u2019. Within the children\nservices context, deliberative dialogue helped participants speak not only as individuals, but as\nmembers of their own organisations, not only as groups with competing interests, but also as a\ncommunity with shared interests, shared concerns and shared goals for children within their\nresponsibility. The \u201cconsensually accepted beliefs\u201d that evolve through inquiry conversations are\nsteeped in normative validity that allow us, for the time, to identify ways forward through\nincreasingly developing commitment for a deliberately chosen course of action. In the children\u2019s\nservice\u2019s case, deliberative dialogue redefined the role of technical expertise within each\nindividual service provider organisation by counterbalancing it with a simultaneous reliance on\nthe experience and the local knowledge of the individuals involved in service delivery. With the\nbenefit of post hock reflection, the inquiry process could have taken any turn and could have\nderailed at any time, in particular, during the first few months of the inquiry. The inquiry\nparticipants\u2019 dedication and the CEO\u2019s maturity enabled the inquiry to take the direction that it\ndid. Overall, the inquiry facilitators\u2019 input and contribution was not critical to the process. Even\nthe most skilful facilitator can derail an inquiry if there is insufficient desire amongst the\nparticipants to see the process through. In effect, one needs to counterbalance the pursuit of\ndeliberative theory with equal attention to the motivation of the inquiry participants engaged in\nthe process (Chambers, 2003:307).\n30\nReferences\nAdler, M.
