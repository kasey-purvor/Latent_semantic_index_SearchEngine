This has the action of preventing splashing, ensures repeatable \nmachining conditions and allows control of liquid flow velocity. To investigate the impact of \nthis technique on ablation threshold, bisphenol A polycarbonate samples have been machined \nusing KrF excimer laser radiation passing through a medium of filtered water flowing at a \nnumber of  flow velocities, that are controllable by modifying the liquid flow rates. An \naverage decrease in ablation threshold of 7.5% when using turbulent flow velocity regime \nclosed thick film filtered water immersed ablation, compared to ablation using a similar beam \nin ambient air; however, the use of laminar flow velocities resulted in negligible differences \nbetween closed flowing thick film filtered water immersion and ambient air. Plotting the \nrecorded threshold fluence achieved with varying flow velocity showed that an optimum flow \nvelocity of 3.00 m\/s existed which yeilded a minimum ablation threshold of 112 mJ\/cm\n2\n. This \nis attributed to the distortion of the ablation plume effected by the flowing immersion fluid \nchanging the ablation mechanism: at laminar flow velocities Bremsstrahlung attenuation \ndecreases etch rate, at excessive flow velocities the plume is completely destroyed, removing \nthe effect of plume etching. Laminar flow velocity regime ablation is limited by slow \nremoval of debris causing a non-linear etch rate over \u201en\u201f pulses which is a result of debris \nproduced by one pulse remaining suspended over the feature for the next pulse. The impact of \nclosed thick film filtered water immersed ablation is dependant upon beam fluence: high \nfluence beams achieved greater etch efficiency at high flow velocities as the effect of \nBremsstrahlung attenuation is removed by the action of the fluid on the plume; low fluences \nloose efficiency as the beam makes proportionally large fluence losses at it passes through the \nchamber window and immersion medium.  \nIntroduction \nLaser ablation is at the vanguard of the micro and nano manufacturing industries [1-3]. This \ntechnology has been continuously refined and improved upon in terms of laser fluence, \noptical resolution and production speed since the emergence of the technique in the late \n1970s [3]. However, one area has continued to plague the laser ablation pattern machining \nsector: laser ablation generated debris [4]. Debris can contribute to beam attenuation after \nejection but before deposition [5]. Debris can be generated in a mode that coats unimportant \nareas, areas still to be machined or worse still, features that have already been machined [6]. \nThus, debris poses a direct threat of lowering manufacturing yield by these means. To \ncompound matters, debris can coat machinery, requiring costly downtime for cleaning and \nservicing [7], or the debris can become airborne in the working environment of tool users, \nposing potential respiratory health issues [8]. The use a technique involving closed flowing \nthick film filtered water immersion of the sample during laser ablation has shown promise as \na plausible solution for such problems [9, 10]; however, the impact of such techniques on the \nbasic laser machining characteristics are not extensively documented; only the effect of thin \nfilm open immersion on ablation rate and threshold having been previously detailed [11, 12]. \nThis work will explore the impact of closed flowing thick film filtered water immersion laser \nablation machining using KrF excimer laser radiation on the ablation threshold of bisphenol \nA polycarbonate in comparison to the machining properties of the same material in ambient \nair and, furthermore, the importance of liquid flow velocity, V, to the ablation threshold will \nalso be explored in detail in this work. \nThe threshold fluence of laser ablation is useful in assessing the efficiency of a laser \nmachining system at material removal. Losses in equipment or media surrounding the \nsubstrate will be most evidently be evidenced by use of this measureand, as it describes the \nminimum energy required from the laser for material ablation to commence []. The threshold \nis measured as a Beers law relationship, and thus a predicted threshold value (where surface \nmodification ends and ablation commences) can be interpolated []. \nIn gaseous or vacuum media, various mechanisms such as phase explosion and surface \nevaporation [15, 16], photothermal effects [17, 18] or photomechanical and acoustic \ninteractions [19] act individually or in a combination thereof, as discussed in the review of \nGeorgiou and Koubenakis [20]; moreover, Prasad et al. have conducted extensive effort into \nmodelling such interactions [21]. The introduction of a liquid to this system poses a \nsignificant modification to the interaction typical in gaseous or vacuum environments \nnormally used for machining [22, 23, 24-27]. A technique for delivering a long wavelength \nlaser wavelength by use of a fine jet of water proves that use of such mediums do not pose \nunacceptable attenuation of the beam [28]. When using liquid as a media for laser ablation, \nZhu et al. [23] demonstrated that a threshold film thickness for immersing liquids exists, \nlying at 1.1 mm. using a closed flowing thick film filtered water immersion depth below this \nvalue significantly reduces the ablation rate compared to that of ablation in ambient air. Use \nof an immersing liquid depth greater than the 1.1 mm value and the opposite is true. The \ncause of this is identified and explained by Dowding and Lawrence [11], where splashing is \nwitnessed when using thin film regime flowing open immersion \u2013 thus signifying the \nexplosive rupture of the immersing thin film of liquid by the ablation plume, which negated \nall action of ablation plume etching. Simultaneously, the immersing liquid film contained the \nplume long enough to significantly reduce laser etching by Bremstrahlung attenuation. This \ntheory relies on the principle of acoustic type surface etching as described by Dyer et al. [29], \nwhere violent excitation of the substrate surface layers results in shear cracking and then \nejection of solid species from the surface; application of a confined ablation plume, as can be \nproduced by closed flowing thick film filtered water immersion will amplify such acoustic \neffects. Also, the ejection of surface melt and advent of surface evaporation, generated by \nablation plume heating, a probable phenomenon in gaseous media [14], will be amplified by \nthe action of thermodynamic compression of the ablation plume by the confining liquid \nmedia. The existence and efficacy of ablation plume etching can be proven by the example of \nlaser induced backside wet etching (LIBWE), pioneered by Wang et al. [30] LIBWE has been \nshown to reduce laser ablation threshold fluence for wavelength transparent materials, such \nas Quartz for excimer laser applications, by more than an order of magnitude [31, 32]. Work \nhas been conducted to investigate the effect of open immersion on the ablation rate of \nexcimer laser ablation of bisphenol a polycarbonate [27, 11, 12,]. A number of limitations \nwere observed and causes diagnosed. Splashing was a common occurrence during machining. \nThis was attributed to irregular but broadly increased plume pressure, which significantly \nattenuates the laser beam en-route to the sample surface [12]. In a thick film regime, the \nvolume of liquid above the ablation plume confines the plume expansion and prevents it from \nfree expansion in the manner allowed by the less viscous medium of ambient air, thus the \ncompressed, high pressure ablation plume attacks the surface of the sample to be machined \ncausing a high etch rate due to the plume which more than compensates for the loss of laser \netching due to inverse Bremstrahlung attenuation [23, 24, 25, 12]. When using open thin film \nimmersion, the same volume of liquid is not available to confine the ablation plume pressure, \ncausing a threshold pressure exists in this condition; once exceeded, rupture occurs and \nplume gas escapes violently from the covering liquid film into the ambient air above, \nproducing liquid splashing as a by-product [12]. The action of turbulence, instigated by the \nnon-symmetrical drag profile, combined with the strong contribution of meniscus instability \nsuch as inertial, capillary and viscous effects, described schematically in Figure 1(a), of a \nflow running across a flat plate in the open flow immersion technique allowed surface ripple \nto occur and thence the depth of liquid above the plume varied with respect to time and \nposition above the sample, this results in an irregular and non-repeatable plume etch-rate. \nThis is witnessed by the fluctuation between ablation depths with increasing numbers of laser \npulses that should have produced a linear relationship in a regular, repeatable surrounding \nmedium. \nThe use of a closed ablation chamber has removed the variance of the flow geometry both \nwith respect to time and position above the sample to be machined by ensuring the drag on \nthe boundaries of the flow symmetrical about the centre of the flow, as described \nschematically in Figure 1(b), and removes the meniscus that dominates flow characteristics in \nopen flows. These two factors combined result in reduced eddy generation. A drawback of \nhaving a sealed flow is that thin film regimes (less than 1.1mm in thickness [23]) could allow \nthe compressed ablation plume to extend through the flowing liquid from the sample surface \nto the bottom surface of the chamber window, potentially plume etching the window and \npermanently damaging a critical component in the optical path of the beam. Hence, the \nexperiments conducted in this work are of the thick film regime to prolong the life of the \nchamber window. Nevertheless, the use of a closed flow chamber guarantees optical \ngeometry of the final medium before the sample and maintains a repeatable and regular \ncontainment of the ablation plume during and after laser pulses. Because of this, the closed \nflow geometry equipment allows the authors to directly investigate the importance and action \nof liquid flow velocity, a parameter that is controllable by modifying the flow rate, Q, on the \nfundamental ablation characteristics of closed flowing thick film filtered water immersion. \nExperimental Procedures \nMaterial Details \nBisphenol A polycarbonate (Holbourne Plastics, Ltd), was as received in 1200 x 1000 mm\n2\n \nsheets of 0.5 mm thickness. Prior to excimer laser processing, the bisphenol A polycarbonate \nsheet was cut into rectangular sections of 8 x 12 mm\n2\n using scissors - a shear cutting \ntechnique which avoids production of debris. Protective cover sheets were then peeled off \neach sample. \nLaser Details and Experimental Set-Up. \nFor both closed flowing thick film filtered water immersion and ambient air processing, an \nexcimer laser (LPX200; Lambda Physique, GmbH) using KrF as the excitation medium was \nused to produce a beam with a wavelength of 248 nm. Thereafter, the beam was supplied to a \nlaser micromachining centre (M8000; Exitech, Ltd), where it was passed through a stainless \nsteel mask to produce a 201 x 203 \u00b5m\n2\n rectangular image. The masked beam was then \ndemagnified through a 4x optic (Francis Goodhall, Ltd) to produce an ablation spot with a \ndepth of focus (DoF) of 6 \u03bcm. A profile of the masked beam was obtained using a beam \nprofiler (SP620U; Spiricon, Ltd), which showed that the beam shape had an even distribution, \nwith only a slight positive skew across the y-axis; demonstrating good positioning of the \nmask in the raw beam. \nA sample included six machined sites, each produced using 50 pulses in the same machine \nrun with uninterrupted filtered water flow over the sample during machining. The system \nattenuator was used to change pulse energy by a repeatable amount between sites. Attenuator \npositions used were: 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9 and 1.0; Figure 2 shows the corresponding fluence \nvalues measured using this mask, for ablation in ambient air and under filtered water \nimmersion respectively, that produced features of 203 x 205 \u00b5m\n2\n. This fluence data was \ncalculated from pulse energy data taken using a pulse energy head (J50LP-2, Molectron \nDetector, Inc.) positioned above the focal point of the laser, and enumerated by a laser energy \nmeter (EM400, Molectron Detector, Inc.). The fluence was calculated using the mean beam \nenergy measured (averaging techniques were employed for experimental rigour: beam pulse \nenergy was recorded five times before and after machining each sample, every value recorded \nwas the mean value measured over 100 pulses - between readings the attenuator was reset to \naccount for attenuator position errors) so that any changes in laser output over time were \naccounted for. \nAmbient Air Laser Processing \nSamples machined in ambient air were produced, using the same laser and micromachining \nequipment as the closed flowing thick film filtered water immersion ablation samples. The \nbisphenol A polycarbonate samples were mounted directly to the vacuum chuck inside the \nmicromachining station (M8000, Exitech, Ltd). After lasing ended the sample was removed \nand placed into the cell of a sealed sample tray to protect them from atmospheric dust. \nClosed Thick Film Filtered Water Immersion Laser Processing Procedure \nFigure 3(a) describes the critical experimental layout of the sample once clamped inside the \nflow rig, which was mounted to the side of the sample vacuum chuck of the laser micro-\nprocessing centre (M8000; Exitech, Ltd.). The sample was positioned in the centre of the flat \naluminium table between the water supply and exit holes. The sample was retained by a \nrecess in a spacer plate (to provide a 1.5 mm thick water film) that lay in contact with the \naluminium sample table. An O-ring cord, located by a rectangular groove in the sample table, \nprovided a seal between the sample table and the spacer plate. On the top of the spacer plate a \nsecond oval O-ring groove was machined to located another O-ring cord. This acted as a \ngasket between the spacer plate and the beam window \u2013 a 25 x 25 x 5 mm3 ultra-violet grade \nfused silica sheet (Comar Instruments, Ltd). The beam window was retained by a diamond \nshaped recess in a third aluminium plate, 8 mm in thickness to provide stiffness to the whole \nsandwich.  \nFigure 3(b) shows the water filtering and supply system. Water originated from normal mains \nsupply by wall tap. The water was poured into a domestic water filter (Britta, Inc.) situated at \nthe top the water supply assembly to remove typical corrosive elements present in mains \nwater. The water was then retained in a header tank located above the pump and, under the \naction of gravity, was forced into the 700 W pump chamber (CPE100P, Clarke Power \nProducts, Ltd.). The pump forced the water through a water flow rate meter (FR4500, Key \nInstruments, Inc.) and then along a 3 m distance through a 6 mm outer diameter nylon tube to \nthe inlet push-in elbow fitting on the bottom of the sample table. Last, the water was returned \nalong a further 3 m through a 6 mm outer diameter nylon tube to a collection bucket. The \npump was capable of producing 4.2 bar at the outlet, equating to a maximum flow velocity \nthrough the ablation chamber of 3.89 m\/s, given losses along the supply and return tubing. \nPrecise control of the flow velocity was provided by a variable valve of the flow-meter. Flow \nvelocities of 0.03, 0.11, 1,39, 1.85, 2.31, 2.78, 3.24 and 3.70 m\/s were used for this work; the \nflow rates used to achieve these flow velocity values are given in Table 1.  \nSample Analysis Techniques \nThe ablation depths were measured using a dragged needle profiler (CM300 Talysurf; \nTaylor-Hobson, Ltd). Five passes were made across the surface of the sample and into each \nfeature at 50\u00b5m intervals. To minimize the possibility of profile error, the mean average \ndepth of each sample feature was then calculated from a selection of three profiles for each \nsample feature. To guard against outlier samples being produced and effect the ablation \nthreshold measurements taken, all data plotted for interpretation in these results are mean \naverage values taken from the data produced by three sample features machined using each \nflow velocity.  \nImpact of closed thick film filtered water immersion on ablation threshold. \nAblation threshold is a useful tool for measuring the effectiveness of a technique at etching a \nmaterial: low threshold fluence indicates that minimal laser energy is required to remove \nmaterial from a substrate. Figure 4 shows two plots describing the feature depth machined \nagainst the natural log of the laser fluence required. In the standard way, each plot has been \nfitted with a linear trend line that has been extended to predict the natural log of the minimum \nlaser fluence required to etch the material. The solid trend line in Figure 4 is the etching trend \nfor 248 nm laser radiation in ambient air of bisphenol A polycarbonate; The dashed linear \ntrend line in Figure 4 is an average of the ablation etching trend of 248 nm laser radiation of \nbisphenol A polycarbonate that has been immersed in a closed filtered water layer (1.5 mm \nthick) flowing at a number of velocities from 1.39 m\/s to 3.70 m\/s. This demonstrates that \nturbulent flow velocity closed thick film filtered water immersion ablation has an average \nthreshold fluence taken from all turbulent flow velocity samples) of 116.6 mJ\/cm\n2\n, compared \nthe higher value required in ambient air of 126.1 mJ\/cm\n2\n. Turbulent flow velocity thick film \nclosed filtered water immersion is 7.5% more efficient at etching bisphenol A polycarbonate \nthan laser ablation in ambient air. This is a result that agrees with the previous work of others \n[22-27], who collectively determined that the increased etching efficiency with respect to \nlaser fluence is due to the action of plume etching. Plume etching occurs when the ablation \nplume is prevented from expanding by a viscous surrounding medium [22]. Under \ncompression, the gaseous species, initially generated by photonic interaction with the sample, \nhave increased temperature when compared to similar gases inside an ablation plume, it is \ntherefore able to expand with ease. These gasses aggressively attack the surface of the \nsample, so, restricted plume expansion by use of a viscous surrounding media gives rise to \nplume etching. This is in contrast to the effects of laser ablation machining under open thin \nfilm immersion [11], where the loss in ablation efficiency was accredited to the action a \nplume motivated rupture. Here, the high pressures initially generated inside the plume, that \nwas initially restricted in growth by the surrounding thin film of de ionized water, rapidly \nbecome too high for the thin film of water to contain; resulting in explosive escape of gases \nfrom the immersing film. This scenario results in loss of plume etching action, but the \nexistence of the plume during the laser pulse decreased the magnitude of laser energy arriving \nat the substrate by the action of Bremsstrahlung attenuation; thus both etch mechanisms \navailable are limited by use of an open immersion technique [12]. \nImpact of turbulent flow thick film filtered water immersion on ablation threshold \nIn Figure 5(a) the etch depth achieved using 248 nm excimer laser ablation on bisphenol A \npolycarbonate under closed thick film filtered water at six flow velocities ranging from 1.39 \nm\/s to 3.7 m\/s in increments of 0.46 m\/s, is plotted with respect to the natural logarithm of \nlaser fluence. This allows for the ablation threshold fluence at each flow velocity to be \ncalculated. Table 1 lists the calculated ablation threshold fluences which are plotted in Figure \n5(b). All of these samples were produced in a turbulent flow velocity regime (Q > 0.88 m\/s), \nwhere the filter water flowing over the bisphenol A polycarbonate sample was travelling at \nsufficient velocity to have a Reynolds number above 4000; thus having a turbulent flow. As \ncan be seen in the plots shown in Figure 5(a), the gradient and x-intercept of all the samples \nare similar, as confirmed numerically by the trend line gradients offered in the top left of \nFigure 5(a). This repetition of etch efficiency confirms that the experimental procedure is \nrobust and the closed flowing thick film filtered water immersion technique provided a \nrepeatable and stable medium that ablation can occur within. Despite the apparent similarity \nof all these plots, the resulting threshold fluence values demonstrate a flow velocity \ndependent trend that may be explained by interaction between the flowing filtered water and \nthe ablation plume. The plot given in Figure 5(b) shows the threshold fluence of the six \nsamples plotted with respect to the flow in which they were machined. This indicates that \nachieving minimum threshold fluence requires an optimum flow velocity. Turbulent flows \nbeneath this do not significantly distort the ablation plume, as given in Figure 6(b), causing \nmaximum compression of the plume and maximum traverse distance for the beam through \nthe plume resulting in increased Bremsstrahlung attenuation. The optimum flow velocity for \nbisphenol A polycarbonate according to the results plotted in Figure 5(b) lies at 3.00 M\/s, \nwhere the situation drawn in Figure 6(c) occurs, where the flow causes distortion of the \nplume to reduce traverse distance for the beam through the plume and therefore minimized \nBremsstrahlung attenuation whilst allowing the existence and action of plume etching by the \nstill compressed ablation plume. Above the optimum flow velocity, the plume is blown away \nbefore it can become fully developed, as is the case in figure 6(d), reducing or negating the \nplume etching effect, leaving only the laser beam, that now has minimal obstacles for \npossible attenuation to pass through, to etch the material. The small changes to threshold \nfluence made across this broad range of flow velocities (which corresponds to an increase in \nflow velocity of 166% from the lowest value plotted in the turbulent flow velocity regime) \nmeans that the laser ablation threshold is not critically sensitive to the use of a non-optimum \nflow velocity.  \nImpact of laminar flow closed thick film filtered water immersion on ablation \nthreshold. \nFigure 7 plots the etch depth of the mean average of all the turbulent flow velocity regime \nsamples with respect to the natural logarithm of the fluence along with plots for two samples \nmachined using laminar flow velocity regime closed filter water immersed ablation that both \nhad flow velocities low enough to ensure laminar flow are also given. Threshold fluence \nvalues for the laminar flow velocity regime samples are given in Table 1. As has been stated \nabove, the ablation threshold value of the average turbulent flow velocity regime samples has \nbeen calculated to be 116.6 mJ\/cm\n2\n. The sample produced at the highest laminar flow \nvelocity had a threshold fluence of 125.7 mJ\/cm\n2\n, a value similar to that of the lowest \nvelocity turbulent closed thick film filtered water immersion flow velocity sample, which had \nan ablation threshold measured at 126.52 mJ\/cm\n2\n. This result supports the proposal that \nlaminar flow velocities allow the ablation plume to become fully developed inside the liquid \nvolume, as shown in Figure 6(b), producing maximum Bremsstrahlung attenuation of the \nlaser beam. Losses in laser etching due to Bremsstrahlung attenuation are then partially \ncompensated for by the action of plume etching being unaffected by the action of the \nturbulent flow velocity. The samples produced using the slowest flow velocity of all those \nlisted in this work show a very poor correlation. This poor correlation appears to support the \nidea described schematically in Figure 6(a), where the flow velocity did not have a magnitude \nsufficient to remove debris produced by one pulse from above the feature before the arrival of \nthe next pulse, resulting in an unreliable laser fluence at the feature. \nFlow \u2013 plume interaction states. \nA more detailed explanation of the impact of increasing flow velocity on the ablation \nthreshold under closed thick film flowing filtered water immersion is made clear by Figure 6. \nThe premise of the closed flowing thick film filtered water immersion technique is to entirely \nclear the image area of debris produced by a laser pulse before the following pulse arrives, \nthus the velocity of the flow with respect to the pulse frequency is critical. Whereas very low \nflow velocities do not remove debris reliably between pulses, resulting in unreliable laser \nfluence at the sample surface (see Figure 6(a)); using a flow velocity that is sufficiently high \nto fully and reliably clear debris from above the feature, but lower than the optimum flow \nvelocity, causes total etch rate loss due to the Bremsstrahlung attenuation of the fully \ndeveloped compressed ablation plume, (see Figure 6(b)). But, this loss is compensated for by \nthe etching action of the plume (see Figure 6(b)). The optimum flow velocity is achieved \nwhen the immersing liquid washes a proportion of the ablation plume away during the laser \npulse, not allowing excessive Bremsstrahlung attenuation, but simultaneously not completely \ndestroying the ablation plume, thereby preserving the action of plume etching, a state \nillustrated by Figure 6(c). When greater than optimum flow velocities are used they allow \nmaximum laser etching, the high viscosity of a liquid medium will deform the ablation plume \nduring the laser pulse, reducing the plume etching mechanism described in the literature [24-\n27] by removing the ablation plume before it has fully developed (see Figure 6(d)). These \nfour states are described in terms of etching contribution by laser and plume by the \nhypothetical plot in Figure 8. The data generated in this work shows that direct laser ablation \netching is still the dominant factor in this interaction, as the curve in Figure 5(b) describes. \nWhen the plume becomes fully developed, Bremsstrahlung attenuation has a far greater \nlimiting effect on the ablation threshold than high flow velocities washing away the \ncompressed ablation plume. The optimal flow velocity for achieving minimal threshold \nfluence is achieved by a compromise, indicated by the dashed vertical line in Figure 8, where \nthe combination of laser etching and compressed plume etching result in an increased etch \nrate greater than the maximum etch rate achievable by either of the component etch \nmechanisms alone. This plot shows the dependence of plume etching on the existence of \nsignificant laser etching, as laser etching is required to develop an ablation plume that can \nthen go on to become compressed and begin etching itself. The plume etch rate declines as \nthe immersing liquid flow velocity begins to wash the ablation plume away at higher \nvelocities, leaving just the action of laser etching, at mechanism that relies on mechanical and \nchemical interactions [19, 20]. \nThe average ablation threshold fluence can be plotted with respect to the closed thick film \nfiltered water immersion fluid flow velocity (see Figure 9). Initial inspection of Figure 8 \nsupports the states described in detail above. Sub optimum turbulent flow produced a \nmaximum threshold, measured to be 126.52 mJ\/cm\n2\n,  denoting poor etching efficiency, where \nhigh Bremsstrahlung attenuation limited laser etching, the size of the plume and therefore the \naggressive etching action of the compressed hot gasses inside a water immersed plume, as \ndescribed to the left of Figure 8. As the flow velocity is increased towards the optimum \nthreshold value of 111.76 mJ\/cm\n2\n, the ablation threshold fluence drops. This is what one \nwould expect to happen as the magnitude of laser etching and plume etching increased \ntogether. As the flow velocity rises beyond 3.24 m\/s to the maximum magnitude tested, the \nthreshold fluence begins to rise slightly again to 115.71 mJ\/cm\n2\n, where the ablation plume \nwas beginning to be washed away before it was able to become fully developed, leaving only \nthe action of laser etching to remove material. \nImportance of fluence on ablation threshold under closed thick film filtered water \nimmersion.  \nThe previous discussions only take into account the average ablation threshold measured \nacross all laser fluences. If the data is split to high fluence data and low fluence data, two \nplots can be generated; these show a clear contrast to each other. In Figure 10(a) high laser \npulse fluence data is plotted. This data shows the turbulent flow velocity regime samples had \nsignificantly lower threshold fluences than high fluence ambient air samples. The threshold \nfluence increased drastically to a value of 399.16 mJ\/cm\n2\n for the lowest flow velocity. In \ncontrast, the low laser pulse fluence data, plotted in Figure 10(b), had significantly reduced \nthreshold fluence for the very low flow velocity and greatly increased threshold fluences for \nthe turbulent flow velocity regime data. The two filter water plots appear to be mirror images \nof each other about the threshold fluence of bisphenol A polycarbonate in ambient air. This \ncan be explained by returning to the theory of confined ablation plumes [22] and the drag \nimparted onto it by the liquid flowing over it. At laminar flow velocities the plume generated \nwas not removed, it was able to become fully developed and etch the sample as it lay under \ncompression. High fluence resulted in significant Bremsstrahlung attenuation, hence a high \nthreshold fluence. Low fluence laser pulses always perform well for etch efficacy in ambient \nair because they do not produce large plumes and waste energy with heating via multi photon \ninteractions [14] a fact demonstrated by the magnitude of the threshold fluence in ambient air \nin Figure 10(b). Any etching provided by the plume to supplement this efficient removal by \nlow fluence pulses significantly increased the etch rate with respect to the laser energy \nsupplied, causing the low threshold fluence recorded for the lowest flow velocity. As the flow \nvelocity increased to the turbulent flow velocity regime, the ablation plume was removed, \nallowing maximum laser etching without any Bremsstrahlung attenuation that limits high \nfluence pulse efficiency in air. This was of no aide to power pulses, that lost the \nsupplementary action of plume etching with the deletion of the ablation plume, removing any \nadvantage over ablation in ambient air. Losses due to attenuation of the equipment, such as \nthe flow chamber window, which was 5 mm thick and the immersing filtered water itself, \nresulted in the increased recorded threshold fluence for turbulent flow velocity closed filtered \nwater immersion ablation evident in Figure 10(b). \nConclusions \nThe use of  turbulent flow velocity regime closed thick film filtered water immersion ablation \nresults in an average decrease in ablation threshold of 7.5%, compared to ablation using a \nsimilar beam in ambient air. This is the result of the combined action of laser etching and \nablation plume etching, which is a symptom of the plume pressure being increased as the \nexpansion of the plume is restricted by viscous surrounding liquid medium. \nConversely, laminar flow velocity regime closed thick film filtered water immersion ablation \nresults in a decrease in ablation threshold of just 0.3% compared to ablation using a similar \nbeam in ambient air; thus, it can be likened to a negligible gain. This is interesting as it \nsuggests a shift in ablation mechanism. \nTo investigate this theory, the effect of flow velocity on the ablation threshold has been \nrecorded. All plots of the feature depth machined into bisphenol A polycarbonate using 50 \npulses of KrF excimer laser radiation under turbulent flow velocity closed thick film filtered \nwater immersed ablation with respect to the natural log of the laser fluence display similar \ngradients. Plotting the threshold fluence values projected from this data against the flow \nvelocity they were produced with results in a plot trend of subtle but interesting significance: \nto achieve minimum threshold fluence, an optimum flow velocity exists: measured in this \nwork to be 3.00 m\/s. This effect is credited to a flow velocity dependent shift in ablation \nmechanism relating to the distortion of the ablation plume by the flowing volume of \nimmersion liquid. At lower flow velocities the ablation plume remained directly above the \nfeature during the entirety of the pulse, thus generating maximum Bremsstrahlung attenuation \nand limiting laser etching (and as a result plume etching). As the flow velocity climbed, an \noptimum condition was found where the ablation plume geometry was distorted by the \nflowing immersion fluid in a manner that simultaneously allowed lower Bremsstrahlung \nattenuation and maximum plume etching, that combine to produce increased etch efficiency \nthan the laser beam alone. With further increase of the flow velocity the ablation plume was \ncompletely destroyed by the flowing immersion fluid, negating Bremsstrahlung attenuation \nand allowing unimpeded laser etching coupled with negligible plume etching. \nLaminar flow velocity immersion was limited by another factor: suspended debris beam \nattenuation. The flow was slow enough to cause debris produced by one pulse to remain \nsuspended over the site of the feature as the following pulse arrived; therefore, intercepting \nthe beam en route to the feature. This gave rise to the scenario of non linear etch rate over \u201en\u201f \npulses. \nThe effect of closed thick film filtered water immersion on ablation threshold has been shown \nto vary with respect to beam fluence. For high fluence beams, the ablation threshold was \nsignificantly reduced when compared to ablation in ambient air at turbulent flow velocities. \nConversely, for low fluence beams all but the lowest flow velocity tested showed significant \nincrease in ablation threshold over a similar beam in ambient air. This is attributed to the \naction of plume etching being flow velocity dependant. For high fluence beams, the removal \nof the plume allows maximum laser etching, but when using low fluence beams, the \nsignificant relative attenuation posed by the closed flowing thick film filtered water \nimmersion equipment became a serious disadvantage when compared to ablation in ambient \nair. \nReferences \n1.

Values plotted in \nFigure 4(b). \n \nList of Figures \nFigure 1(a): open flow \u2013 causes an uneven drag profile, generating rolling turbulence in the \nmanor described by the black vectors. Generation of turbulence always occurs after a \ncharacteristic flow displacement, dependant upon fluid properties. Figure 1(b): closed flow \u2013 \nsymmetrical drag profile, generating a flow velocity profile similar to that described by the \ngrey arrows. The generation of turbulence is dependent upon flow velocity; laminar flow-\nrates do not generate turbulent flow. \n \nFigure 2: A comparison of beam fluence  generated at various attenuator positions recorded \nfor both the filtered water samples and the ambient air samples \n \nFigure 3(a): the closed immersion ablation assembly: 1) sample; 2) base plate; 3) sample \nclamp and flow chamber spacer; 4) U.V. grade fused silica window for laser beam; 5) \nwindow clamp; 6) clamping bolts that squeeze components together. Figure 3(b): the fluid \nsupply unit: 1) source water; 2) filtering; 3) filtered water storage; 4) centrifugal pump; 5) \nflow-rate control valve; 6) high pressure flow-rate controlled filtered water outlet to flow-rate \nablation chamber. \n  \nFigure 4: Two plots describing the etch depth achieved using 50 pulses of varying laser beam \nfluence in ambient air and the average etch depth achieved using 50 pulses of varying laser \nbeam fluence across all turbulent flow velocities tested under closed thick film filtered water  \n Figure 5(a): a detailed set of plots describing the ablation threshold of six different samples \nmachined under turbulent velocity regime closed thick film filtered water immersion. Figure \n5(b): a plot of the etch depth dependency on flow velocity of bisphenol A polycarbonate \nimmersed by filtered water. \n \nFigure 6(a): when the flow-rate is laminar and the laser pulse frequency is high, the liquid \nflow may not remove all of the debris before the next pulse arrives, thus the suspended debris \nmay obscure the pulse, effecting the machined profile; Figure 6(b): a flow velocity lying \nbelow the optimum allows the ablation plume to fully develop, maximizing Bremsstrahlung \nattenuation and near compensating by uninhibited plume etching; Figure 6(c): the optimum \ncondition occurs when the flowing liquid distorts the ablation plume to minimize \nBremsstrahlung attenuation, without removing the action of plume etching; Figure 6(d) when \nusing a very high flow velocity with respect to the pulse width of the laser the ablation plume \nmay become distorted by the viscosity of the fluid. This may have an impact on plume etch \nrate. \n \nFigure 7: a graph comparing the average ablation threshold achieved using turbulent flow \nvelocity regime thick film closed immersion ablation and two laminar flow velocity regime \nthick film closed immersion machined samples. \n \nFigure 8: a schematic plot showing the action and combination of plume etching and laser \netching and the flow velocity dependence of both. An optimum point exists and is depicted \nby the dashed vertical line, where the summation of both etching mechanisms combines to \nmaximum effect. \n Figure 9: a comparison of average threshold fluence measured at all thick film closed \nimmersion flow velocities against the ablation threshold in ambient air. \n \nFigure 10(a): a comparison of the average threshold fluence measured for high fluence pulses \nat all thick film closed immersion flow velocities against the ablation threshold in ambient \nair. Figure 10(b): a comparison of the average threshold fluence measured for low fluence \npulses at all thick film closed immersion flow velocities against the ablation threshold in \nambient air. \nTable 1 \nFlow Rate \n(l\/min) \nFlow Rate \n(l\/s) \nFlow Velocity \n(m\/s) \nThreshold Fluence \n(mJ\/cm\n2\n) \n2.00 0.033 3.70 115.7 \n1.75 0.029 3.24 111.8 \n1.50 0.025 2.78 114.1 \n1.25 0.021 2.31 113.0 \n1.00 0.017 1.85 118.6 \n0.75 0.013 1.39 126.5 \n0.06 0.001 0.11 125.7 \n0.015 0.00025 0.03 See text \nFigure 1 \n \nb) a) \nFigure 2 \n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n700\n800\n900\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\nAttenuator Position\nB\ne\na\nm\n F\nlu\ne\nn\nc\ne\n (\nm\nJ\n.c\nm\n-2\n)\nAmbient Air\nFiltered Water\n \nFigure 3 \n \n \n5 \n4 \n3 \n2 \n1 \n6 \na) \n1 \n2 3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \nb) \nFigure 4 \ny = 6.6167x - 32.005\ny = 5.523x - 26.44\n-2\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nLn FLUENCE (mJ)\nF\nE\nA\nT\nU\nR\nE\n D\nE\nP\nT\nH\n (\nu\nm\n)\nAMBIENT AIR\nIMMERSION\nLinear (AMBIENT AIR)\nLinear (IMMERSION)\n \nFigure 5(a) \ny = 6.3779x - 30.213\ny = 6.1777x - 29.136\ny = 6.7782x - 32.81\ny = 6.3028x - 30.1\ny = 6.1411x - 29.029\ny = 6.3084x - 29.972\n-2\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n4.5 4.6 4.7 4.8 4.9 5 5.1 5.2 5.3 5.4 5.5 5.6 5.7 5.8 5.9 6 6.1 6.2 6.3 6.4 6.5 6.6\nLN FLUENCE (mJ\/cm^2)\nF\nE\nA\nT\nU\nR\nE\n D\nE\nP\nT\nH\n (\nu\nm\n)\n3.70 m\/s\n3.24 m\/s\n2.78 m\/s\n2.31 m\/s\n1.85 m\/s\n1.39 m\/s\nLinear (2.78 m\/s)\nLinear (3.24 m\/s)\nLinear (1.39 m\/s)\nLinear (1.85 m\/s)\nLinear (2.31 m\/s)\nLinear (3.70 m\/s)\n(a)\n110\n112\n114\n116\n118\n120\n122\n124\n126\n128\n0.00 0.50 1.00 1.50 2.00 2.50 3.00 3.50 4.00\nFlow Velocity (m\/s)\nT\nh\nre\ns\nh\no\nld\n F\nlu\ne\nn\nc\ne\n (\nm\nJ\n\/c\nm\n2\n)\n(b)\nFigure 6 \na) \nshutter \nspeed = 1\/2  \nFrequency \nb) \nshutter \nspeed = 2 x  \nFrequency \nc) \nshutter \nspeed = 5x  \nPulse Width \nd) \nshutter \nspeed = 1\/10  \nPulse Width \nFigure 7 \ny = 3.2602x - 15.049\ny = 5.7508x - 27.8\ny = 5.523x - 26.44\n-2\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nLn FLUENCE (mJ)\nD\nE\nP\nT\nH\n (\nu\nm\n)\nAVERAGE HIGH FLOWRATE\n0.11 m\/s\n0.03 m\/s\nFigure 8 \nL\nas\ner\n E\ntc\nh\nin\ng\n \nP\nlu\nm\ne \nE\ntc\nh\nin\ng\n \n7.5% of \nmax \nFlow Rate \nDebris not removed   \nbetween pulses (Figure 7(a)) \nHigh Bremsstrahlung \nattenuation by low plume \ndeformation (Figure 7(b)) \nOptimum: laser etching + \nplume etching (Figure 7(c)) \nPlume blown away (Figure \n7(d)) \nMaximum laser             \nEtching (Figure 7(d)) \nToo little plume generated by \nlaser etching to instigate plume \netching (Figure 7(a and b)) \nFigure 9 \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\n0.00 0.50 1.00 1.50 2.00 2.50 3.00 3.50\nFlow Velocity (m\/s)\nF\nL\nU\nE\nN\nC\nE\n (\nm\nJ\n\/c\nm\n^\n2\n)\nFILTER WATER\nAMBIENT AIR\n \nFigure 10 \n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n350\n400\n450\n0.00 0.50 1.00 1.50 2.00 2.50 3.00 3.50\nFlow Velocity (m\/s)\nT\nH\nR\nE\nS\nH\nO\nL\nD\n F\nL\nU\nE\nN\nC\nE\n (\nm\nJ\n\/c\nm\n^\n2\n)\nFILTER WATER\nAMBIENT AIR\nNOTE:\nAttenuator = 0.7 value disregarded for \n0.015L\/min plot as error.\n \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\n0.00 0.50 1.00 1.50 2.00 2.50 3.00 3.50\nFlow Velocity (m\/s)\nT\nH\nR\nE\nS\nH\nO\nL\nD\n F\nL\nU\nE\nN\nC\nE\n (\nm\nJ\n\/c\nm\n^\n2\n)\nFILTER WATER\nAMBIENT AIR\nNote: Attenuator = MAX reading \ndisregarded for 0.06L\/min plot as error.\n \n \n"}
