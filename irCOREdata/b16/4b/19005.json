A modi\ufb01cation\nencompassing both systems was described by\nTauber et al,1 who proposed that counting the\nnumber of, and percentage horizontal obliteration\nof the lower fornix by symblephara could potentially\nimprove detection of disease progression.\nWe have previously shown that lower fornix\nshortening is documented either subjectively or\nsemi-objectively by utilising a slit-light beam, the\ndegree of upper forniceal obliteration is seldom\nquanti\ufb01ed.5 Furthermore, we have shown that, at\nthe initial visit to tertiary referral centres, Foster \u2019s\nstaging of disease is undertaken in 100% of\npatients\u2019 lower fornix, but only 78% of patients had\nquanti\ufb01cation of forniceal shrinkage. This is prob-\nably related to the dif\ufb01culty in assessing lower\nfornix depth accurately without the aid of a made-\nfor-purpose tool.6\nMeasurement of the fornices using devices such\nas the fornix depth measurer (FDM) has previously\nbeen described, but their design restricts accurate\nupper fornix measurements.7 8 Speci\ufb01cally, the\ndepth and curvature of the upper fornix dictates\nthat the ideal FDM must be suf\ufb01ciently long and\ncurved to enable comfortable and accurate assess-\nment of it. We previously used in routine clinical\npractice an FDM based on that designed by Schwab\net al,7 but its design was suboptimal (\ufb01gure 1). In\n2004, a modi\ufb01cation of the Schwab FDM was\ndesigned at Moor\ufb01elds Eye Hospital for a clinical\ntrial9 and is currently being used in an epidemio-\nlogical study. In 2007, we wanted to redesign and\nevaluate a bespoke comfortable prototype that\ncould provide an accurate tool for improving\nforniceal sac documentation in the outpatient clinic\nsetting, with potential for wider-scale commercial\nmanufacture. In this study we describe this\ncustom-designed FDM constructed speci\ufb01cally to\nfacilitate evaluation of the depth of the upper\nconjunctival fornix, and we assess intraobserver\nand interobserver variability in gauging the extent\nof the upper and lower fornices by validating the\nFDM and comparing it with subjective assessment\nof fornix shrinkage.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nDesign of a bespoke FDM\nApolymethylmethacrylate FDMwasdesignedusing\nindustry-standard jewellery computer software\n(CAD V5, 3Design, Brussieu, France, 2007).

This design feature enables\nmeasurement of the fornix in the context of multiple symble-\nphara, which could potentially hinder the smooth passage of the\nFDM to the limits of the conjunctival sac. The FDM measured\n25 mm3 5 mm and was moulded to a biconcave shape to ensure\nease of insertion and comfort (\ufb01gures 1C and 2B).\nPatients\nAn evaluation of the bespoke FDM was undertaken through\na prospective, masked, independent assessment of central lower\nfornix depth by two observers (GPW, TS), following the Tenets\nof the Declaration of Helsinki. This was undertaken as a service\nevaluation at the Birmingham and Midland Eye Centre (BMEC).\nThe validation of the FDM was conducted on a heterogeneous\ngroup of patients comprising clinically normal and abnormal\nconjunctival fornices presenting to BMEC. This heterogeneity\nenabled a wide range of fornix depths to be tested with the\nbespoke FDM.\nThe cohort consisted of 51 eyes of 26 patientswith amedian age\nof 64 years (range 42e100), of whom 65% (17\/26; 33\/51 eyes) had\nan identi\ufb01able cause of cicatrising conjunctivitis (OcMMP, 10; dry\neyes, \ufb01ve (including three with Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome); Stevense\nJohnson syndrome, two) and 35% (18\/51) had no evidence of\nconjunctival scarring (age-related macular degeneration, four;\nuveitis, three; peripheral ulcerative sclerokeratitis, two).\nAfter instillation of one drop of 0.4% oxybuprocaine hydro-\nchloride, patients were asked to look in the opposite direction to\nthe placement of the FDM (upper fornix, down-gaze; lower\nfornix, up-gaze) in order to protect the cornea, ensure consis-\ntency in readings, and circumvent variability in the eyelid\nposition in primary gaze. The central conjunctival fornix was\nmeasured to the eyelid margin, de\ufb01ned as the posterior lip of the\nmeibomian gland ori\ufb01ce (\ufb01gure 1C). All FDM readings were\ntaken in triplicate, with the \ufb01rst measurement taken used for\ninterobserver comparison. A semi-objective estimation of lower\nfornix conjunctival shrinkage was also performed by gauging the\ncentral lower fornix depth, measured from the inferior fornix to\nthe eyelid margin with the aid of a vertical 1 mm wide slit-lamp\nbeamwith illumination and observation axes in a coaxial position\n(NB a subjective assessment of the upper fornix is impossible).\nThe FDM was sterilised by soaking the device in 0.05% sodium\ndichloroisocyanurate solution for 5 min between patients (as per\nthe BMEC infection control policy for reusable tonometer heads).\nPatients were also asked about their tolerance to the FDM.\nCalculations and statistical analyses\nThe percentage loss of lower fornix for both methods of\nmeasurement (subjective and objective) was calculated using the\nequation:\nf\u00bdfornix depth \u00f0FD\u00de age \u0001 FDM measurement\u0003=FD ageg 3100\n\u00bc % loss of fornix\nA correction factor for age was implemented, as the lower\nforniceal depth is known to progressively shorten with age.7 The\n\u2018FD age\u2019 values were derived from published age-speci\ufb01c lower\nfornix depths in normal eyes detailed in table 1.7 For example,\nFigure 1 Colour photographs\nillustrating the evolution of the fornix\ndepth measurer (FDM).

This is an elongated,\nbiconcave design with engraved\nmarkings to a precision of 2 mm\/step,\nand increments expressed at 2 mm\nintervals on both the main body of the\nFDM and the narrower \u2018handle\u2019. The\nmarkings on the handle facilitate upper\nfornix measurement and the ability to\nmeasure the fornix in the presence of\nsymblephara (D).

A\ncontinuity correction was applied to the 95% limits of agree-\nment to take account of the fact that BlandeAltman plots\nassume that the variables measured are continuous.\nA 10% threshold or \u2018tolerance\u2019 was chosen as an allowance for\nintraobserver variation. Agreement was also evaluated by\ndetermining the percentage of observations that agreed to\nwithin the 10% \u2018allowance\u2019 for both observers.\nRESULTS\nLower fornix assessment\nIntraobserver variation\nTriplicate measurements of FDM readings of the same\nanatomical position by each observer (central lower fornix)\nshowed exact agreement of 86% (42\/49) and 89% (41\/46) of\nmeasurements within observer 1 and observer 2, respectively.\nWhen allowing for 1 mm \u2018tolerance\u2019 (approximating to 10% of\nthe normal lower fornix, see table 1), 100% of intraobserver\nobservations fell within 1 mm for both observers.\nInterobserver variation\nInterobserver variation between the subjective and objective\nmeasurements of the central lower fornix by the two observers\nwas also assessed. Assessment of the lower fornix shrinkage was\nexpressed as a percentage for both subjective and objective\nestimations, the latter using the age correction factor described\nin the methods.7\nFigure 2 (A) A\npolymethylmethacrylate fornix depth\nmeasurer (FDM) was constructed using\nindustry-standard jewellery software\nand machinery.

The interobserver agreement\nwithin the 10% allowance (ie, approximately 61 mm) of total\nlower fornix depth was 86% (44\/51) (\ufb01gure 4).\nIn contrast, the interobserver mean difference in subjective\nestimation of percentage fornix depth was \u00011.86%, and, with\na continuity correction, the 95% limits of agreements (62 SD)\nwere between \u000130% and +25% (\ufb01gure 3). Only 63% (32\/51)\nof the subjective measurements taken by the two observers\nagreed to within a 10% allowance of total lower fornix depth\n(\ufb01gure 4).\nThese data highlight that the FDM afforded greater consis-\ntency in fornix depth measurement by each observer (intra-\nobserver variation) and between observers (interobserver\nvariation).\nUpper fornix assessment\nIntraobserver variation\nTriplicate measurements (to assess intraobserver variation) of\nFDM readings of the same anatomical position of the central\nupper fornix by each observer showed minimal variation (ie,\nidentical objective measurements) in 88% (45\/51) and 70%\n(33\/47) of measurements by observer 1 and observer 2, respec-\ntively. There are no data regarding normal upper fornix depth in\nthe published literature, preventing calculations for age-based\ncorrections and percentage fornix depth foreshortening and\ntolerance threshold.\nInterobserver variation\nInterobserver variation of the upper fornix showed a mean\ndifference in fornix depth measurement using the FDM for\nobserver 1 and 2 of 0.57 mm, with 95% limits of agreement\n(62SD) of \u00012 and + 3 mm (\ufb01gure 5). The absence of normal\nupper fornix values precludes evaluation of the 10% allowance;\nhowever, 84.3% (43\/51) of upper fornix measurements were\nwithin 1SD of the mean difference of 0.57 mm (+2 to \u00011 mm of\nthe mean with a continuity correction).\nPatient comfort and tolerance\nThe FDM was well tolerated by patients, with only a few\n(three) experiencing mild discomfort during upper fornix\nmeasurement, despite repeated measurements. None of these\npatients reported prolonged discomfort or pain.\nDISCUSSION\nPCC comprises a group of disorders characterised by progressive\nscar formation in response to conjunctival in\ufb02ammation\naffecting the stromal layers of the conjunctiva.12 These include\nocular immunobullous diseases such as OcMMP, Stevense\nJohnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, lichen planus,\nlinear IgA disease, paraneoplastic pemphigus and epidermolysis\nbullosa. Other causes include graft-versus-host disease, Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s\nsyndrome, acne rosacea and those associated with topical\ntherapy where progression is reported to be more insidious with\nless destructive clinical sequelae.\nBecause of the sight-threatening consequences of OcMMP, the\nocular phenotype of MMP is regarded as \u2018high risk\u2019,13 particu-\nlarly as disease progression is more aggressive in younger\nFigure 3 BlandeAltman plots showing\ninterobserver variation in lower fornix\nassessment ((A) objective and (C)\nsubjective). Some data points are\nidentical and therefore overlay each\nother on the figures. The percentage\ndifference in assessment between\nobserver 1 and 2 is plotted against the\nmean percentage loss of fornix for each\neye. If there was a completely normal\nfornix, this is represented as 0% loss of\nfornix on the x axis. Note the increase in\nthe 95% limits of agreement (62SD) for\nsubjective assessment (arrowed),\ndemonstrated also by the histograms\n(B,D).\n4 of 6 Williams GP, Saw VPJ, Saeed T, et al.

When considering OcMMP, for example,\nthe most common of the acquired immunobullous diseases that\ncause PCC,12 16 progression may occur at any stage of disease,2 17\nwhich can be aggressive early in the disease course,14 but,\nimportantly, is often independent of clinically identi\ufb01able\nin\ufb02ammation.15 Determining disease progression in the cica-\ntrising conjunctivitides therefore relies upon accurate docu-\nmentation of disease, in particular conjunctival shrinkage of the\nfornices. Although the Mondino staging system is considered to\nbe more sensitive than Foster \u2019s staging system15 and is inte-\ngrated into the system proposed by Tauber et al,1 Mondino\nfornix depth measurement is reported to be undertaken in only\n78% of new patients in tertiary referral centres compared with\n100% documentation of the Foster \u2019s system.\nVigilant assessment, quanti\ufb01cation and documentation of\nforniceal foreshortening is mandatory for enabling accurate\npatient follow-up, currently not achieved by subjective or semi-\nobjective assessments of the fornix. These approaches are\nlimited by inconsistency and poor reproducibility and reliability,\nbut are overcome by the development and implementation of\nfornix depth measuring devices for the assessment and\nprogression of diseases that cause conjunctival scarring.7 8 18 Our\naim was to design an FDM based upon the original concept of\nSchwab et al,7 but with additional upper fornix depth capability.\nSpeci\ufb01cally, our custom-made FDM was found to be comfort-\nable and accurate. Designed and made using industry-standard\ncomputer software and machinery, this FDM prototype was\nmodelled mathematically taking into account the curvature of\nthe globe necessary for comfortable measurement of the upper\nfornix. We tested our bespoke FDM on patients with a range of\nfornix depths in the presence or absence of conjunctival \ufb01brosis.\nOur \ufb01ndings showed low intraobserver and interobserver vari-\nability, enabling repeatable and reproducible measurements of\nboth upper and lower fornix depths, highlighting its potential in\nfacilitating both accurate and robust clinical documentation of\ndisease stage. This FDM prototype is currently being optimised\nwith further modi\ufb01cations to improve comfort and \ufb01t.\nCrucially, the conjunctival cicatrising process is not con\ufb01ned\nto the lower fornix, and sight-threatening sequelae secondary to\nsubtarsal \ufb01brosis, upper lid entropion or lash trauma commonly\nensue. These clinicopathological processes are not taken into\nFigure 4 Difference in objective (A) and subjective (B) lower fornix\nassessment between observer 1 and 2. The number of individuals that\nagree to within a 10% \u2018allowance\u2019 are boxed and are higher for objective\nmeasurements (86% (44\/51)) than for subjective measurements (63%\n(32\/51)).\nFigure 5 (A) BlandeAltman plot showing interobserver variation in upper fornix assessment. As there are no defined limits for the upper fornix, the\ncalculations are in mm. The mm difference in assessment between observer 1 and 2 is plotted against mean mm measurement for each patient. The\n95% limits of agreement are vertically arrowed and also represented by a histogram (B). (C) Difference in upper fornix assessment between observer 1\nand 2; the 10% allowance cannot be calculated in the absence of normal upper fornix values, but 71% (36\/51) of measurements were within 1 mm, and\n92% (47\/51) of observations were within 2 mm of each other.\nWilliams GP, Saw VPJ, Saeed T, et al. Br J Ophthalmol (2010). doi:10.1136\/bjo.2010.188011 5 of 6\nClinical science\n group.bmj.com on February 10, 2011 - Published by bjo.bmj.comDownloaded from \nconsideration by ocular staging systems that calculate\npercentage obliteration of the lower fornix,1 2 4 although are\nre\ufb02ected in the staging system described by Foster where fornix\nshortening or symblephara of any degree throughout the\nconjunctival surface are thought to be important.3 The\ndecreased sensitivity in relying solely upon this system, or those\nthat include direct measurement of the lower fornix alone,\nincrease the risk of type 2 errors (false negatives) in determining\ndisease progression, which are considerably rescinded by the use\nof fornix depth measuring devices for the upper fornix.\nThe larger depth of the upper fornix and dif\ufb01culty of access\nexplains the omission of detailed upper fornix pathology in\ncurrently recognised scoring systems.1 2 4 Perhaps not surpris-\ningly therefore, there appear to be few data in the ophthalmic\nliterature regarding the anthropology and normal depth of the\nupper fornix. Kawakita and colleagues8 have recently discussed\nthe use of a non-curved 15032 mm FDM in Japanese patients\nwith StevenseJohnson syndrome and healthy volunteers. They\nfound that the mean superotemporal and superonasal upper\nfornix depths were 14.162.5 mm in normal people. Our \ufb01ndings\nshow a median central upper fornix depth of 16 mm in\na caucasian group of patients, even in the presence of recognised\ncases of cicatrising conjunctivitis. The variation in central upper\nfornix depth among healthy populations using anthropological\nethnography together with differences in age remains unre-\nsolved. This has recently been highlighted in the context of\nother diseases affecting the size of the upper fornix such as the\ngiant fornix syndrome described by Rose.19 These data illustrate\nthe need for population-based studies of normal age-based upper\nfornix depths to facilitate calculations of percentage shrinkage in\nconjunctival scarring diseases. Such studies are currently being\nundertaken at BMEC and Moor\ufb01elds Eye Hospital.\nIn summary, our custom-designed FDM was well tolerated by\npatients in this study, with only three experiencing short-lived\nmild discomfort during assessment of the upper fornix. This\nFDM shows low intraobserver and interobserver variability,\nenabling repeatable and reproducible measurements of lower\nfornix depths. We believe that the custom design of an FDM\nusing industry-standard jewellery software and machinery,\ncurved to \ufb01t the globe, provides an accurate and comfortable\nmeans of assessing lower fornix depth. Furthermore, it offers the\npotential to measure upper fornix depth, currently not routinely\ncarried out in clinical practice, thereby improving both the\ndetection and monitoring of progressive conjunctival \ufb01brosis in\nthis group of devastating disorders.\nAcknowledgements GPW is a Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Fellow (London,\nUK).
