The importance of skills is increasing even at the bottom end of the skill distribution, \nand apprenticeships are seen as one way to create high skill levels for non-college bound youths \n(Nickell and Bell, 1996, and Freeman and Schettkat, 2001, provide evidence for comparatively high \nskill levels at the bottom end of the German skill distribution). The apprenticeship systems in \nGermany, Austria and Switzerland are also believed to deliver relatively low youth unemployment \nrates because they facilitate an orderly school-to-work transition (OECD 1998, Ryan, 2001, \nB\u00fcchtemann, Schupp and Soloff, 1994). \nThe apprenticeship system is not just regarded as exemplary because of its role in the overall economy \nbut also because it delivers desirable results for those who participate: a well paying, interesting job, \nadequate job security, and possibilities for advancement.  This suggests that the private returns to such \ntraining must be high.  While the benefits of the apprenticeship system are often alleged, there are few \nexisting studies of the returns to apprenticeship training. Krueger and Pischke (1995) and Winkelmann \n(1996) present OLS estimates of the returns to apprenticeship training in Germany in the order of 15 to \n20 percent, and Fersterer and Winter-Ebmer (2003a) find returns of 15 percent for Austria \u2013 as return \nto a training period of three to four years.  \nEstimating the returns to apprenticeship training is not straightforward.  Soskice (1994) argues that \nthere is a lot of heterogeneity in the quality of apprenticeships, and firms select apprenticeship \ncandidates extensively among secondary school leavers. This selection would bias any OLS estimates \nof the returns to training but there is virtually no empirical evidence on the degree of selection. Much \nof the heterogeneity identified by Soskice is related to firm size, and the wages for apprenticeship-\ntrained workers indeed increases strongly in the size of the training firm (see, for example, Acemoglu \nand Pischke, 1998 or Franz et al., 2000, for results for Germany). \n2 \nIn this paper, we try to obtain estimates of the return to apprenticeship training which are free from \nthis selection bias. In order to overcome the selection, we will focus on failed firms.  When a firm \nfails, current apprentices cannot complete their training in this firm.  Because apprentices will be at \ndifferent stages in their apprenticeship at that time, the failure of a firm will manipulate the length of \nthe apprenticeship period completed for some apprentices, as long as not all of them complete the \napprenticeship elsewhere after their firm fails.  The time from entering a failing firm to the actual exit \nof the firm therefore serves as an instrument for the length of the apprenticeship completed both at the \noriginal firm and at other firms. \nThe empirical work is based on the universe of social security records for Austria from 1975 to 1998.  \nThis allows us to identify a large number of apprentices in failing firms.  The comparisons we make \nare limited to workers who started an apprenticeship in failing firms, because these firms will be \ndifferent from firms that continue.  Moreover, all the apprentices analyzed will have to find new \nemployment during or soon after their apprenticeship.  We analyze the wages of these workers once \nthey have taken a post-apprenticeship job.   \nOur analysis of the data suggests that apprentices are typically hired every year until the eventual \nclosure of the firm.  The maintained assumption in the identification of the returns is therefore that \napprentices hired about one to four years before a firm fails will be very similar.   We believe that this \nassumption is most defensible in firms where the failure is rather sudden.  We therefore limit the \nanalysis to small firms.  We also exclude firms where much of the decline in employment occurs \nalready before the eventual firm exit.  Controlling for age rather than experience, we find instrumental \nvariables estimates of the returns to training between 2.5 and 4 percent per year, which are similar or \nabove our OLS estimates. It is important to keep in mind that our sample is a fairly selected subsample \nof training firms.  Our main conclusion is that there seems to be little selection bias in the OLS \nestimates of the returns to training. \nNo previous instrumental variables studies of the returns to apprenticeship training exist so far. A \nspecific instrument typically picks out variation in a particular range of the endogenous variable.  The \nonly existing IV studies of the returns to schooling for Austria by Ichino and Winter-Ebmer (2004) \nand Fersterer and Winter-Ebmer (2003b) focus on secondary schooling. In Austria, differences in \n3 \nsecondary schooling eventually tend to imply that an individual either obtains lower secondary \nschooling plus an apprenticeship or other vocational training, or a higher secondary degree plus \nacademic education. This is not the relevant return for the marginal apprentice (i.e. someone at the \nborderline between undertaking an apprenticeship or no post-junior-high-school training at all).  The \nsame is true for IV studies of the returns to schooling in Germany by Ichino and Winter-Ebmer (1999, \n2004) and Becker and Siebern-Thomas (2004).   \nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows.  The next section describes the Austrian schooling \nand training system.  The following section discusses the estimation strategy and section 4 describes \nthe data set we use.  Section 5 presents the results.  Section 6 offers some concluding remarks. \n \n2 The Austrian Schooling and Training System \nThe Austrian school system tends to be relatively complex, with a multitude of different educational \nroutes at a particular age.  Children start school at age six and attend a four-year primary school.  After \ngrade four, the school system tracks students into two types of secondary schools.  Academic \nsecondary schools lead to a university entrance exam (Matura) after grade 12. School leavers from this \ntype of school typically enter universities, polytechnics (Fachhochschule), or other tertiary academies.  \nGeneral secondary school (Hauptschule) lasts for 4 years, and offers an academically less challenging \ncurriculum than academic secondary schools.    The school is supposed to prepare students for further \nvocational training at the end of the compulsory schooling age.  Students who intend to pursue an \napprenticeship supplement it with a one year pre-vocational school before leaving full-time schooling \nat age 15.  Alternatively, students can enter a full-time vocational school, either an intermediate \nvocational school, which intends to prepare students primarily for a profession, or an upper vocational \nschool, which supplements training for a profession with the preparation for the university entrance \nexam.   \nSelection into the different types of secondary school depends on a combination of primary school \ngrades and the recommendations by the primary school, a formal entrance exam, and parental choice.  \n4 \nThere are also rules based on grades and exams, which allow students to transit from lower secondary \nschools to the academic secondary schools. \nAbout 40 percent of a cohort complete an apprenticeship, mostly after leaving general secondary \nschool.  23 percent leave school at 15 without any formal qualifications (Hauptschulabschlu\u00df) and \nstart work as an unqualified laborer. Apprentices will receive training in a particular occupation in a \nfirm.  In addition, the apprentice will attend a part-time vocational school (Berufschule), either one or \ntwo days a week or in block courses at certain times during the year.  The firm provides both the \npractical component of the training as well as on-the-job experience. The vocational school \nsupplements the training by more theoretical components tailored to the chosen occupation, as well as \nproviding further liberal arts education. In addition to learning at the firm and in vocational school, \nsome training firms organize joint courses or send their apprentices to external training centers for \ncertain aspects of the training. This happens more frequently in small firms, for example, because they \nlack certain machines, which are supposed to be part of the training curriculum.  \nThe apprenticeship training is highly regulated. There are currently 275 apprenticeship occupations, \nwith nationally legislated curricula.  Each training firm has to satisfy certain requirements in order to \nbe allowed to take on apprentices.  In particular, there has to be a qualified trainer at the firm.  The \noversight of the training firms is done by the Apprenticeship Offices of the regional chambers of \ncommerce. They also carry out the graduation exams for the apprentices.  Apprentices obtain an \nallowance, negotiated in union contracts, which differs by occupation.  The remuneration of \napprentices starts out very low in the first year, and may rise up to about 80 percent of a skilled \nworker\u2019s wage in the last year. \nApprenticeships are not at all homogeneous, and the content and quality of training will vary greatly \nbetween occupations and training firms.  Apprenticeships last between two and four years. Durations \nof two and two and a half years are rare (1 percent of all apprenticeships), while durations of three (62 \npercent) and three and a half years (26 percent) are the most common (see Schneeberger and \nKastenhuber, 1996, Table 16).  The duration of the apprenticeship may be reduced if the apprentice \nhas prior relevant skills or a higher level of schooling, like a Matura.  About 10 percent of apprentices \n5 \npursue combination apprenticeships in two related occupations at the same time (Doppellehren).  \nWhere the content of the trades overlaps substantially, these combination apprenticeships can be \ncompleted in a much shorter time span than two individual apprenticeships.  Examples are vehicle \nmechanic\/vehicle electrician, plumber for water and gas\/plumber for central heating systems, or \ncook\/waiter.  11 percent of apprenticeship contracts last 4 years, and almost all of these are \ncombination apprenticeships. \nThe same occupation (say vehicle mechanic) may be learnt either in a small crafts firm, or in a large \nindustrial enterprise. In the small firm, the training will be largely on-the-job, and apprentices are well \nintegrated into the business activity of the firm.  In the large firm, the first year of training may be \nspent entirely in an internal training workshop with full-time trainers.  Afterwards, apprentices may \nrotate to different types of jobs within the firm. \nApprentices can obtain additional credentials after accumulating some experience in their chosen \ntrade.  Additional training and exams may lead to the master craftsman credential (Meister) or an \nequivalent qualification, which allows the degree holder to train apprentices and is often the \nprerequisite for self-employment in a certain profession. \nThe vocational training system in Austria encompasses a wide variety of occupations. An \napprenticeship may be in a traditional crafts profession (baker, cook, mechanic, hair dresser), in \nadministrative and clerical occupations, sales, or in technical professions (machinery electrician, \nchemical laboratory technician).  Vocational training may lead to a qualification, which would be \nconsidered a fairly low skilled occupation in most countries (waiter or sales clerk). But it may also \nlead to an occupation, which would require at least some college education in other countries, \nparticularly when it combines an apprenticeship with more advanced school based training (technician \nor middle manager). \nNot all apprentices complete their apprenticeship.  Some apprentices will leave their apprenticeship \nearly for a variety of reasons.  Many of them will continue their apprenticeship in another firm and\/or \noccupation.  About 18 percent of apprentices dropped out of the apprenticeship system completely in \n6 \nthe 1980s.  About one fifth of apprentices had two apprenticeship contracts, and one tenth had three or \nmore (Schneeberger et al., no date).    \nApprentices may also leave the apprenticeship without the resulting skilled worker credential because \nthey fail the final examination.  About 85 percent of exam entrants pass.  The exam can be repeated \nafter three months if the candidate was unsuccessful.  Roughly 70 percent of failed candidates attempt \nthe exam again within a year and about 75 percent of repeaters pass (Schneeberger et al., no date).  \nThis suggests that more than 90 percent of apprentices pass the final exam eventually.  \n \n3 Empirical Framework \nThe following is a simple framework to think about the behavior of apprentices.  Let L* be the latent \napprenticeship duration for a particular apprentice.  An apprentice, who does not train at a failing firm \nwill realize that duration, so that the actual duration of the apprenticeship is L = L*.  This may be \ncompleted in a single firm, or the apprentice may quit the original training firm and complete the \napprenticeship elsewhere.  Variation in L* combines the fact that different apprenticeship occupations \nrequire a different duration, as well as the fact that some apprentices quit early.  L* is likely related to \nthe ability and motivation of an apprentice, apart from the fact that individuals with different levels of \nL* will have accumulated different amounts of human capital. \nWe only consider failures in the first firm an apprentice joins.  Let K be the time from the entry of the \napprentice into this firm until the firm fails.  This is not necessarily the same as the time an apprentice \nspends in the failing firm.  For example, the apprentice may leave the firm early, either because L* < \nK, or because the apprentice decides to complete the apprenticeship in another firm.  The random \nvariable K will be independent of L* as long as the distribution of L* does not vary among the \napprentices who join the failing firm at different times before the failure.  In other words, the last \napprentices to join a failing firm have to have similar (observable and unobservable) characteristics as \nthose who joined earlier.  This is our key identifying assumption, and we will discuss the \nconsequences of its violation below.  It is important to note that the actual time spent by an apprentice \n7 \nin the failing firm is not independent of L*.  In order to see this, note that apprentices who actually \nstay in the failing firm for time K will by definition have L* \u2265 K, so that these apprentices now come \nfrom a truncated distribution of L*.   \nApprentices in failed firms will realize a total apprenticeship duration L = L(K).  The realized length of \nthe apprenticeship for an apprentice in a failed firm may be equal to L*, it may be shorter, or it may be \nlonger.  An apprentice in a failing firm may leave and complete the apprenticeship elsewhere in the \noriginal time.  However, it is plausible that apprentices, who leave their original training firm, may \ntake longer than originally anticipated to complete their training, maybe because the change of firms \nnecessitates a change in occupation.  Alternatively, an apprentice, whose firm fails, may decide not to \ncomplete their training or simply might not find a suitable training firm, although the apprentice would \nhave completed it otherwise, i.e. L(K) < L*. \nAn important assumption of our approach is that E(L(K)) < E(L*), i.e. being subject to the failure of \nthe training firm on average reduces the completed training of the affected apprentices.  This is similar \nto the existence of a first stage when estimating a system of equations by two stage least squares, and \nit can easily be verified in our data.  If all or most apprentices affected by firm failures took as long or \nlonger to complete their apprenticeship as did those not affected, then there would be no useful \nvariation in L(K) for us to exploit.  This assumption can be checked in our data since we observe L = \nL* among those apprentices whose firm fails after they completed their apprenticeship.   \nFinally, we want to estimate the relationship \nititiit xLw \u03b5\u03b3\u03b2\u03b1 +++= '  (1)\nwhere wit is the log of the post-apprenticeship wage for individual i in year t, xit are other covariates \nlike age, and \u03b5it is an error term.  The standard problem is that Li is related to Li*, which may be \ncorrelated with the error term.  Hence, our approach is to instrument Li by Ki in the sample of \napprentices for whom Ki is four years or less, i.e. who are potentially affected by the failure of their \ntraining firm.  It is important to point out that the controls in xit include age rather than experience.  \nConditional on age, a change in Li affects both apprenticeship duration and experience.  Hence, we \n8 \nwill only estimate the net effect of these.  This is a standard problem in IV studies of the returns to \nschooling where it is common to control for age instead of experience (e.g. Angrist and Krueger, \n1991). \nIf the returns to training differ by individual, and\/or by the stage of training, instrumental variables \nestimation will identify a local average treatment effect (Imbens and Angrist, 1994, Angrist and \nImbens, 1995, and Angrist, Imbens and Rubin, 1996) for the individuals, whose behavior is affected \nby the firm failure (this group is often labeled \u201ccompliers\u201d).  For this interpretation to be correct, it is \nnecessary that a monotonicity assumption holds.  In our case, this means that a firm failure will not \ninduce any individual to stay in the apprenticeship longer than they would have otherwise, or Li \u2264 Li*.  \nWe cannot rule out the failure of monotonicity in our case a priori, but we will discuss below whether \nthere is evidence in our data that some individuals affected by firm failures have longer apprenticeship \ndurations than the control group.  We find that the fraction of individuals with particularly long \ndurations is not higher among those affected by firm failures.  This suggests that the monotonicity \nassumption seems to be satisfied in our data.  \nThe group of compliers in our case, i.e. the apprentices for whom Li(Ki) < Li*, are  likely to be \nindividuals who are closer to the margin of dropping out of the apprenticeship anyway.  In addition, \nwe are not able to measure the return to the entire apprenticeship period, since everybody in the \nsample will have completed some part of training in the failing firm.  Hence, we measure the return to \npartial apprenticeships, and in particular, the later years of the training period.  There may be \nimportant non-linearities in the returns to apprenticeship training, for example due to credential effects \nof receiving the skilled worker certificate.  In estimating equation (1) by instrumental variables we \nmay mistakenly attribute these returns to the part of the apprenticeship period not completed by \ncompliers.1 \n                                                     \n \n1 Unfortunately, we lack information on the receipt of the actual apprenticeship credential, so we are not able to address this \nproblem directly. In addition, our first stage is not powerful enough to use the instrument to separately identify a linear return \nto apprenticeship length and a credential effect. \n9 \nThe failure of a firm is not an event that will be completely unanticipated.  It is well known from other \nstudies that some workers tend to leave firms before the eventual failure (Hamermesh and Pfann, \n2001).  Some apprentices may leave their training firm because they expect the eventual failure of the \nfirm, and the early leavers may not be selected from all apprentices at random.2  This is not directly a \nproblem for our approach.  This behavior may affect who is in the group of compliers, but it does not \naffect the interpretation of the results for that group. \nNotice that the variation in K comes from the fact that some apprentices joined a failing firm just \nbefore the failure, while others joined the firm at an earlier time.  As noted above, our key identifying \nassumption is that apprentices joining within the last four years before the failure of the firm are \ncomparable.  For example, we will overestimate the returns to training if the quality of the apprentices, \nwho are hired before the firm fails, is declining over time because K is positively correlated with \nworker quality in this case.  In order to avoid this, we focus our analysis on a subsample of small \ntraining firms, who fail suddenly, and on apprentices who joined these firms one year before the \nfailure or earlier. We expect our identifying assumption to be satisfied most easily in this subsample. \nAnother issue arises in estimating equation (1).  We have seen that Li can be less than, equal to, or \ngreater than the statutory length for an apprenticeship in the chosen occupation.  It is common in the \nliterature on returns to schooling to use the statutory length of an educational program.  Typically, the \nendogenous regressor will be a variable like \u201chighest grade completed.\u201d  If a student repeats a grade, \nand hence spends additional time in school to reach the same grade level, this additional time is not \ncounted.  Therefore, it seems sensible for our purposes not to count time spent beyond the statutory \nlength of the apprenticeship.  Unfortunately, we do not know what the statutory length is for a \nparticular apprentice.  Hence, we truncate Li at four years, the maximum length of an apprenticeship, \nand use the variable )4,min(~ ii LL = instead.3   \n \n                                                     \n \n2 Such voluntary quits of apprentices may be very unlikely, unlike those of regular workers, because apprentices enjoy a very \nstrict dismissal protection in their training contract. \n3 Results do not change if we use the original durations. \n10 \n4 The Data \nWe use employment records from the Austrian Social Security Administration.  The data set includes \nthe universe of private sector workers in Austria, including apprentices, covered by the social security \nsystem.  It excludes public sector workers and the self-employed.  This is a drawback, since about 10 \npercent of apprenticeship trained workers are self-employed, and self-employment is frequently a \nsuccessful outcome for an apprentice.  For each employment relationship, beginning and end dates are \nrecorded and the establishment in which the worker is employed can be identified.  The data set covers \nthe years 1972 to 1998 but we only use records from 1975 onwards, because the employer level \ninformation is frequently inaccurate in the earlier years.  \nEach establishment has an employer social security number.  Hence, an exit of an establishment in the \ndata occurs when the employer identifier ceases to exist.  While it is possible in principle to build a \nmatched employer-employee panel at a daily frequency this is neither computationally feasible nor all \nthat valuable for our purpose.  To define firm failures, we record the employment status and firm \naffiliation for each individual four times a year, on February 10, May 20, August 10, and November \n10.  We therefore attribute a firm exit to the last quarter before we do not observe individuals with the \nfirm identifier anymore (and the firm does not reappear again later, for example, because it is in a \nseasonal industry).  Hence, firm exits are defined at a quarterly frequency in our analysis.  However, \nsome of these cases may not be true firm exits, and (most of) the employees continue under a new \nidentifier. We use a common strategy in this literature (e.g. Bender et al. 2003 for France) to \nconcentrate our analysis only on cases where we can be sure about firm exit status: If more than 70% \nof the employees continue under a new employer identification number we do not consider this a \nfailure of the establishment.  In some cases, the employer id may refer to the employees in multiple \nsites; in other cases, multiple plants in a single firm may have separate numbers. This is not a \nparticular problem for us, but it may weaken our first stage relationship.   \nFurthermore, we limit our analysis to the subsample of failing firms where the loss in employment in \nthe six months before the quarter of the failure is less than 25 percent.  It is important for our \nidentification strategy to analyze firms that exit suddenly, rather than ones which have a protracted \n11 \nprocess of failing.  In particular, firms which shed workers for a while before the eventual failure will \nlikely have different hiring practices than those who fail rather suddenly.  Hence, we are more \nconfident that apprentices hired relatively close to the failure of the firm are similar to those hired \nearlier in this more limited sample.   \nWe also limit the sample to small training firms with less than 10 employees. This is an interesting \nsubsector, as these firms cover most of apprenticeship positions in the crafts sector.  Our \ninstrumentation strategy of using failed firms does not explain eventual apprenticeship durations very \nwell in the case of apprentices from large firms; this may be due to concerted actions of the local \nchamber of commerce to place apprentices from big failed firms.   \nWe identify firms who fail according to the definition above.  We then begin by recording all workers \nwho received some apprenticeship training in the data set, and who worked in one of these failing \nfirms during some time in their career.  For each worker, we record the exact number of days spent in \napprenticeship training.  Where this training takes place in multiple firms we sum the durations over \nall firms.  Unfortunately, we only know whether a particular employment relationship is an \napprenticeship but not whether training was successfully completed with a formal certificate.  For each \nindividual, we can then track at what time the failure occurred after the worker first entered the firm \n(this is our instrument K).  We only retain those individuals, whose firm fails within 16 quarters from \nthe original entry date.  This should include all apprentices who spent up to four years in the failing \nfirm, and therefore up to the maximum length of an apprenticeship.  Finally, we restrict our estimation \nsample further to those individuals hired within 4 to 15 quarters of failure.  We do this because we \nbelieve that the very last hires of the firm before it exits may be of different quality, something we \ndiscuss further below. \nWe only consider men in the analysis.  In the social security administration records monthly gross \nearnings are measured in May each year. Since some individuals are not employed the full month, we \nstandardize these earnings to give a daily wage for a typical day in employment. We neglect the \nproblem of top-coding of earnings due to social security regulations, because it is largely irrelevant for \napprenticeship trained workers in their first years on the job.   \n12 \n \n5 Results \nOur results are exploiting the fact that some apprentices do not complete their apprenticeship if it gets \ncut short by the failure of their firm.  Failing firms are not a random sample of all firms.  Table 1 \ncompares the population characteristics of apprentices and their training firms with various samples.  \nColumn (4) shows the full population of apprentices.  Comparing columns (2) and (3) in the table to \ncolumn (4) demonstrates that firms who fail are smaller than the average training firm.  Firm sizes for \napprentices who are potentially affected by the firm failure (those joining the failing firms in the last \n15 quarters before failure, column 2) are not very different from those for apprentices who work in \nfirms, which fail after their apprenticeship (column 3).  This is comforting, since it suggests that there \nis not much selection on the firm side on who hires apprentices until close to the time of failure. The \nbiggest difference in the firm size distribution \u2013 as well as in other characteristics \u2013 is between \napprentices who train in ever failing firms, and all apprentices. Only 24 percent of all apprentices train \nin firms with less than 10 employees compared to 40 percent in column (3). Other characteristics of \nthe apprentices and apprenticeship firms are not strongly affected by our sample selection. \nTable 2 presents evidence on the relationship between the potential maximum duration of an \napprentice in the failing firm, K, and the eventual length of the apprenticeship, L.  Apprentices in our \nsample are grouped by the potential duration K, which is broken up into quarters. Each quarter of K is \na column in the table.  In addition, means for everybody unaffected by the failure of their firm are \nsummarized in the last column, labeled 16+.  The first five rows of the table tabulate the distribution of \nthe length of the apprenticeship L, also in quarters, into five categories: L < K, L = K, K < L < 11 \nquarters, L = 11 to 13 quarters, L is 14 quarters or longer. The second category, L = K, also includes \nall apprentices who left the firm within one quarter before failure and did not continue elsewhere.  \nExits from a failing firm rarely happen all at once, even in relatively small firms, and there seemed to \nbe some piling up of individuals also in the category L = K-1.  The third category, K < L < 11 \nquarters, should contain incomplete apprenticeships, but those that are longer than the duration in the \nfailed firm.  The fourth and fifth categories most likely contain completed apprenticeships.  In fact, \n13 \nmost apprenticeships in our data ended after 11 to 13 quarters, and this coincides with the most \ncommon contractual durations.  Some apprenticeships last longer, or apprentices might have done \ncombination apprenticeships.  Hence, individuals in the fifth category (14 or 15 quarters) may have \nlegitimately taken as long to complete an apprenticeship, or they could have taken longer to complete \ntheir apprenticeship, for example because they had to switch training firms.  \nIn considering table 2, start by looking at the distribution for those apprentices who joined a failing \nfirm 16 or more quarters before failure.  These apprentices were not affected by the firm failure during \ntheir apprenticeship (and are not used in our analysis below).  59 percent of them completed their \napprenticeship within the standard time (11 to 13 quarters), and another 27 percent took longer than \nthat.  About 14 percent dropped out early, and most likely did not complete their apprenticeship.4   \nCompare this distribution to those who joined the failing firm within 10 quarters or less to failure.  \nOnly around 48 to 55 percent of apprentices finish within 11 to 13 quarters in this group.  18-25 \npercent of apprentices take longer. There is no evidence that any apprentices affected by the firm \nfailure during the apprenticeship took longer to complete their training than those not affected.  This \nsuggests that the monotonicity assumption is likely satisfied in our sample. On the flip side, 26 percent \nof affected apprentices left their apprenticeship early.  This means that early termination in this group \nis about 12 percentage points larger than among those who trained in firms failing after 16 or more \nquarters.  This difference is statistically highly significant and economically large.  \nThis suggests that the failure of a firm induces some apprentices to leave the apprenticeship earlier \nthan they would have otherwise.  In fact, among apprentices who joined firms within 10 months of \nfailure, about 14 percent of early terminations occur in the categories L < K and K < L < 11, matching \nearly terminations among those who joined 16 or more quarters before failure closely.  About 12 \npercent are found in the category where L = K, indicating that the additional early terminations \n                                                     \n \n4 It has to be taken into account that we do not observe formal completion of the apprenticeship contract which \nrequires a successful completion of an exam.  \n14 \nbasically all occur right around the time of the firm failure.5  Hence, it seems like much of the \ndropping out induced by the failure of the firm seems to be coming from apprentices, who would have \notherwise completed their apprenticeship. \nTable 2 also displays the mean duration of the apprenticeship for each potential duration group.  This \nis around 1000 days, slightly less than 3 years or 12 quarters.  Apprentices, who joined the failing \nfirms 16 quarters or more before failure have an average duration of 1078 days which is 80 days more \nthan those who joined closer to the failure.  Since quarter to failure is our instrument, this gives a \nbroad indication for the magnitude of the first stage effects.6   \nFinally, the table also displays the number of observations in each quarter to failure group.  This \nnumber is relatively small for the apprentices, who joined very close to failure.  It becomes somewhat \nmore stable for those apprentices joining before 5 quarters to failure, although the numbers are highest \nfor those joining 12 to 14 quarters to failure.  This indicates that within the last year before the failure \nof the firm it may be clear that the failure is imminent or possible.  Therefore, fewer apprentices are \nhired at that stage.  This makes us worried that there may also be more selection among the group of \napprentices who are still hired, or among the firms who still hire apprentices at that stage.  Hence, we \nrestrict the estimation sample to those apprentices who join the firm within 4 quarters to failure or \nmore. \nThe relatively large number of apprentices, who have been in the failing firm for 12 to 14 quarters, \nmight indicate that firms delay their exit behavior when they have an apprentice whose completion of \nthe apprenticeship is imminent.  This behavior by firms would only impact our instrumental variables \nestimates if it were correlated with unobserved determinants of the later earnings of the apprentices \n                                                     \n \n5 If one looks at the full cross tab with quarterly information for every category of L instead of aggregating rows \nas in Table 2, the quarter where K= L is always the one with the highest cell percentage except for quarter 12, \nwhich is the regular apprenticeship duration. \n6 It is straightforward to decompose the total duration of apprenticeships into complete and incomplete durations \naccording to E(L) = E(L|incomplete)P(incomplete) + E(L|complete)(1 - P(incomplete)), where we treat any \nduration up to 10 quarters as incomplete.  For the group who joined firms within 10 quarters of failure average \nincomplete durations are 562 days compared to 569 days among unaffected apprentices.  For completed \ndurations the means are 1147 and 1162. These means are rather similar, also indicating that almost all the \ndifference in durations is accounted for by the higher probability not to complete the apprenticeship among those \nwho were affected by firm failure. \n15 \naffected.7  However, it may also explain the relatively small number of apprentices who join 15 \nquarters to failure, and the fact that many of those who are observed tend to have relatively long \napprenticeships.  They may simply be apprentices in occupations with long apprenticeship duration. \nBefore proceeding, we merged the data on apprentices analyzed in the previous tables with the wages \nthe apprentices earn later.  There are up to 23 wage observations per apprentice, and the average \nnumber of observations per individual is 8.5.  The resulting panel data set has 47,881 observations.  \nWe account for the repeated observations on individuals in the following regressions by clustering \nstandard errors at the level of individuals, using the \u201ccluster\u201d option in Stata 10.   \nWe use two versions of the instrument.  The first is a series of dummy variables for each quarter until \nthe firm failure.  Alternatively, we use a variable that is linear in the quarters until failure.  The single \nlinear instrument is more robust to weak instruments problems, and it produces somewhat different \nresults.  Table 3 displays the corresponding first stage regressions.8 The other regressors in the model \nare age and age squared, a dummy for individuals without Austrian nationality, and dummies for 22 \nsurvey years and eight regions.  The length of the apprenticeship is measured in days, but is scaled in \nterms of years, so that our estimates are easily comparable to standard estimates of returns to \neducation.  The coefficients on potential duration bounce around and are often insignificant for the \nfirst five quarters.  Between 9 and 12 quarters, the eventual length of the apprenticeship rises, and \nfinally reaches a plateau of more than a quarter of a year in the range from 12 to 15 quarters.  Not \nsurprisingly, this pattern mirrors the one we already found in table 3 above.   \nThe individual coefficients for quarters 10 and higher are highly significant.  The F-statistic for the \njoint significance of the excluded dummy instruments is 80.  This suggests that the correlation of our \ninstruments with the endogenous regressor is high enough that \u201cweak instrument\u201d problems are \nunlikely. Stock, Wright and Yogo (2002) consider first-stage F-values below 10 to 20 to be \n                                                     \n \n7 This would be the case, for example, if a firm decided to delay its exit when it has a particularly able apprentice but close \nearly with a weak apprentice.   \n8 We have also regressed the linear version of the instrument on the few pre-apprenticeship covariates available in our data: \nage at the start of the apprenticeship, whether the individual is a foreigner, and education (which is only available for \nindividuals who claim unemployment benefits at some stage during the observation period).  These variables were neither \nindividually nor jointly significant in our estimation sample.  \n16 \nproblematic.  Our F-statistic clearly exceeds these thresholds.   F-statistics with the linear instrument \nare even higher.  Not surprisingly, when we estimate our models with LIML we obtain identical \nresults to standard 2SLS.  \nTable 4 displays our main results.  Column (1) displays a relatively standard log wage regression on \nthe length of the apprenticeship, controlling for potential labor market experience.  The return to an \nadditional year of apprenticeship is about 5 percent.  This is consistent with earlier work by Fersterer \nand Winter-Ebmer (2003a), who find returns to apprenticeship training of around 15 percent for the \nentire apprenticeship period.  Given that an apprenticeship lasts on average about 3 years, this implies \na return of about 5 percent a year.   \nColumn (2) displays OLS estimates where we replace labor market experience with age.  Labor \nmarket experience is correlated with the length of the apprenticeship, and hence also endogenous.  \nControlling for age rather than experience is therefore common in many IV studies of the returns to \nschooling.  The return controlling for age is 2.7 percent now, much lower than controlling for \nexperience.  It is common to find lower returns to education in regression models controlling for age \nrather than potential experience.  In our sample of young workers, additional apprenticeship training \nreplaces experience which is also quite valuable, so the difference in the estimates is large. \nThe IV estimates are shown in columns (3) and (4).  The estimate of 2.3 percent in column (3) using \nthe dummy instruments is practically the same as the OLS estimate.  The return is now less precisely \nestimated, and is not significantly different from zero.  This imprecision is a natural consequence of \nthe fact that IV estimation removes much of the variance in the length of the apprenticeship variable.  \nThe magnitude of our standard errors is similar as those in other IV studies of the returns to schooling, \nfor example, Angrist and Krueger (1991).  Column (4) shows the results using the linear version of the \ninstrument.  The point estimate is higher than in column (3) but this estimate is still not significantly \ndifferent from the OLS estimate.  Our IV estimates therefore suggest returns which are similar or \nsomewhat larger than the OLS returns. \n17 \nIt is important to remember that our approach identifies the joint effect of apprenticeship training and \nany commensurate change in experience.  Since the identifying firm closures take place during the \napprenticeship period, any change in experience necessarily involves post-layoff experience.  One \nworry about our study is therefore that some other variable, for example \u201ctime since layoff,\u201d rather \nthan apprenticeship duration drives our results (as in von Wachter and Bender, 2006).  As a check on \nour approach, we have therefore computed similar estimates on a sample of apprenticeship trained \nworkers, who experienced a layoff due to firm closure in their first job after rather than during the \napprenticeship.  \nIn this sample, everybody got to complete their apprenticeship but experienced a layoff within the first \n16 quarters in the first post-apprenticeship job.  This job may or may not be in the training firm, \ndepending on whether and how long apprentices stayed at that firm.  Like before, workers in this \nsample also have to find a new job after the layoff, and we only consider wages after workers find jobs \nin new firms.  The sample for this robustness check is slightly smaller (31,040 observations) since we \nhave fewer post-layoff periods on the wage now. \nIn order to create results that are most closely comparable, we focus on the reduced form regression, \nwhich corresponds to our IV model in column (4) of Table 5.  The reduced form involves a regression \nof the wage on Ki, the potential duration in the firm where the layoff occurs.  For simplicity, we focus \non the specification with the linear potential duration.  The reduced form coefficient corresponding to \ncolumn (4) of Table 5 is 0.0044 (with a standard error of 0.0021).  In our sample for post-\napprenticeship layoffs, the corresponding coefficient is -0.00014 (with a standard error of 0.0012).  \nHence, given our setup, the timing of layoffs in the first post-apprenticeship job does not affect later \nwages at all.9 This is comforting since it suggests that it is unlikely that it is the dynamics of wages \nsubsequent to a layoff which drives our results. \n                                                     \n \n9 This is not necessarily inconsistent with the literature on wages losses and subsequent recoveries associated \nwith layoffs, for example von Wachter and Bender (2006).  Our key regressor does not measure time since \ndisplacement but rather potential time to displacement in the layoff firm. \n18 \nIn summary, we find the IV estimates of the wage returns to apprenticeship training to be as high as or \nhigher than the OLS estimates.  We have taken care in selecting a sample where biases in the IV \nestimates due to a potential correlation of the instrument with apprentice quality are less likely.  As a \nresult, our estimates are restricted to a specific set of apprentices who trained in a narrow set of firms.  \nTherefore, we do not think that the actual magnitude of the results is as interesting as the relative \nsimilarity of the OLS and IV estimates, although the basic OLS results are not very different from \nearlier findings on a broader set of training establishments. \n \n6 Conclusion \nApprentices and non-apprentices differ in many dimensions, and there is anecdotal evidence that better \ntraining providers tend to select the best school leavers.  This suggests that standard OLS returns to \napprenticeship training may be biased upward because of the selection.  This is the first study to use an \nexogenous event to attempt to estimate returns which are free from selection bias.   \nOur focus on failed firms necessarily implies that we are not able to estimate returns for a very \nrepresentative sample of apprentices.  We focus on small firms.  Both small firms and firms that fail in \ngeneral may be relatively poor training providers, particularly in the final phase of their existence. \nMoreover, we estimate returns to partially completed apprenticeships, which is different from the \nreturn to the entire apprenticeship.  In particular, we estimate primarily returns to the latter part of the \napprenticeship, which may consist mainly of work experience rather than formal training, and \ntherefore have lower returns.  But it also includes any credential effects, which may raise returns.  Our \nsample also excludes individuals who become self-employed, which may be associated with greater \nsuccess and hence higher wages.  Finally, we observe wages for workers when they are relatively \nyoung (26 years on average).  For all these reasons one might expect that our return estimates differ \nfrom those in a more representative sample.  Nevertheless, our basic OLS estimates are similar to \nearlier findings. \n19 \nOur main result is that the estimated returns for apprentices affected by the firm failure are not very \ndifferent from the OLS returns in the same sample.  This suggests that selection in the drop-out \nbehavior of apprentices is not particularly important.  OLS returns to apprenticeship training have \npreviously been found to be of similar magnitudes to other forms of education.  From this we conclude \nthat apprenticeship training does not seem to be superior to other forms of school based education, say \nin colleges or vocational schools.  This conclusion, of course, rests on the premise that we can \nextrapolate the degree of selection bias in our highly selected sample to the general population of \napprentices.  One drawback of our focus on small firms is that an important degree of selection may be \ndue to the size of the training firm, with larger firms recruiting better apprentices. \nThere are some other important limitations to our study.  We only estimate wage returns.  Some of the \nbenefits of apprenticeship training may be in the form of higher employment probabilities and a \nreduced incidence of unemployment.  Our data set is not well suited for analyzing this possibility since \nit only covers private sector employment.  Hence, we cannot distinguish unemployment from \nemployment in the public sector or self-employment.  Apprenticeship training is often regarded as \nfacilitating an easier school-to-work transition than is the case in purely school based education \nsystems.  This is difficult for us to ascertain, because all of our apprentices have had their ties to the \noriginal training firm severed because of the firm failure.  This makes it difficult to draw conclusions \nabout the attachment to the firm and the labor force from this particular group.  In addition, we only \nlook at wage returns for apprentices while they are still relatively young.  Some of the returns to \napprenticeship training may be accruing later on, for example, when some trained workers go on to \nbecome master craftsmen. \n20 \nReferences \nAcemoglu, Daron and J\u00f6rn-Steffen Pischke (1998) \u201cWhy Do Firms Train?
