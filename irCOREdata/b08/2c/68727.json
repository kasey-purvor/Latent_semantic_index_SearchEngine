The fastest potential consumption of N2O occurred under anoxic conditions 26 \nwith little soil nitrate and under elevated headspace N2O concentration. Potential N2O 27 \nconsumption rates were fastest in organic soils under hemlock and beech trees (111 and 28 \n75 ng N2O-N g\n-1\n d\n-1\n, respectively) compared to mineral soils under beech and maple trees 29 \n(45 and 41 ng N2O-N g\n-1\n d\n-1\n). Organic soils showed faster N2O consumption rates than 30 \nmineral soils, possibly due to larger organic C levels and higher C:N ratios. Acetylene 31 \ntreatment confirmed that denitrification was the process underlying N2O consumption. 32 \nThese results suggest that soils regularly consume N2O with varying magnitude, most 33 \nlikely in anoxic microsites throughout the soil profile and that the potential for N2O 34 \nconsumption is larger in organic than in mineral forest soils. 35 \n36 \n 3 \nINTRODUCTION 37 \nSoils emit nitrous oxide (N2O), a greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere and account 38 \nfor 10 of the 16 Tg nitrogen (N) of the total N2O released into the atmosphere each year 39 \n(IPCC 2001; IPCC 2007). Approximately 4 Tg comes from agricultural soils, thus of 40 \nanthropogenic origin, while the remaining 6 Tg are attributed to emissions from soils 41 \nunder natural ecosystems (IPCC 2001; IPCC 2007). Although forest soils are net sources 42 \nof N2O to the atmosphere, there is evidence that soils may also consume atmospheric 43 \nN2O (Arah et al. 1991).   44 \nThe capacity of soils to act as sources or sinks of N2O is the result of dynamic 45 \nmicrobial processes of consumption and production occurring within the soil profile 46 \n(Chapuis-Lardy et al. 2007). Denitrification and nitrification are the two dominant 47 \nmechanisms of N2O production; other biological and abiological processes (such as 48 \nassimilatory and dissimilatory nitrate reduction and chemodenitrification) are thought to 49 \ncontribute < 1% of N2O emissions (Chapuis-Lardy et al. 2007). The mechanisms of N2O 50 \nconsumption in soils are less well studied and both atmospheric N2O and locally 51 \nproduced N2O can be taken up by soils and reduced to N2 as the last step in the 52 \ndenitrification process, owing to the N2O reductase enzyme (named Nos; Chapuis-Lardy 53 \net al. 2007). Nitrifiers have also been shown to play a role in N2O consumption by 54 \nreducing NO2 to N2, a process called nitrifier denitrification (Megonigal et al. 2004).  55 \nAlternative processes of consumption have also been suggested, including aerobic 56 \ndenitrification and assimilatory reduction to ammonia (NH3) (Chapuis-Lardy et al. 2007, 57 \nVieten et al. 2008). 58 \nThere is a lack of knowledge of the potential for and the controllers of N2O 59 \nconsumption in forest soils, though mechanisms have been identified. Few studies have 60 \ninvestigated N2O consumption directly, yet many focusing on emissions have 61 \nnevertheless cited negative fluxes (from the atmosphere to the soil), which have often 62 \ngone unexplained (Chapuis-Lardy et al. 2007). Additionally, even where net emission is 63 \nobserved, consumption processes can exert a significant effect on its magnitude (Arah et 64 \nal. 1991). Much of the uncertainty leading to the large range in estimated forest soil 65 \nemissions is related to the possibility of an underestimation of the potential for N2O 66 \nconsumption, which could depress estimated emissions (Ullah et al. 2008).  67 \n 4 \nIn other work complementary to the present study, at two deciduous forest sites in 68 \nsouthern Quebec, Mont St. Hilaire (MSH) and Morgan Arboretum (MA), we measured 69 \nsoil N2O fluxes along hill slope catenas. While overall N2O emission has been observed 70 \nfrom the forest soils over the growing season, net consumption of N2O was observed 71 \nfrom well-drained soils at both sites during several summer sampling dates in 2006, 72 \nparticularly in June and July, though the rates remained small (Unpublished data). N2O 73 \nconsumption rates ranged from 3.1 \u00b1 1 to 6.0 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b5g N2O-N m\n-2\n h\n-1\n in well-drained 74 \nsoils under American beech (Fagus grandifolia) and sugar maple (Acer saccharum) at the 75 \nMSH and MA sites, ranging from 0.1 to 22 \u00b5g N2O-N m\n-2\n h\n-1\n in these soils. Overall, there 76 \nwas a net emission of N2O to the atmosphere from well-drained soils under American 77 \nbeech and sugar maple, averaging 3.0 \u00b1 0.7 and 5.4\u00b1 0.3 \u00b5g N2O-N m\n-2\n h\n-1\n, respectively, 78 \nwhen N2O consumption rates were included in the calculation. When consumption rates 79 \nwere excluded from the calculation, net emissions rates averaged 5.5 \u00b1 0.5 and 6.5 \u00b1 0.6 80 \n\u00b5g N2O-N m\n-2\n h\n-1\n, respectively (Unpublished data). Chapuis-Lardy et al. (2007) cited two 81 \nstudies in which N2O consumption was observed in temperate deciduous forests, with 82 \nrates ranging from 0.6 to 66 \u00b5g N2O-N m\n-2\n h\n-1\n (Dong et al. 1998, Goossens et al. 2001). 83 \nThis suggests that N2O consumption through denitrification is occurring within soils and 84 \ncan have significant impacts on net and average fluxes of N2O from the soils. 85 \nThe range of environmental factors influencing N2O fluxes from these soils is 86 \nbroad, including both biogeochemical factors, such as NO3, NH4, and organic C 87 \navailability, as well as physical factors such as soil texture, porosity, moisture, and 88 \ntemperature (Megonigal et al. 2004, Chapuis-Lardy et al. 2007, Ullah et al. 2008). These 89 \nfactors may affect the soil microbial populations, favoring certain functional groups and 90 \nprocesses over others (Megonigal et al. 2004), as well as differences among topographic 91 \nposition and forest type (Ullah et al. 2008). Knowledge of the ways in which these 92 \nfactors control N2O fluxes in different soils is incomplete, particularly as related to 93 \nconsumption processes (Chapuis-Lardy et al. 2007); in general, factors that limit N2O 94 \ndiffusion appear to encourage consumption, including low mineral N levels and high 95 \nmoisture contents, suggesting denitrification as a principal mechanism for this 96 \nconsumption (Bandibas et al. 1994, Megonigal et al. 2004). In addition, the enzyme 97 \nresponsible for N2O reduction in denitrifiers (Nos) is known to be particularly sensitive to 98 \n 5 \npH and oxygen (O2) (Chapuis-Lardy et al. 2007).   99 \nWe hypothesized that a) wet soil conditions and anaerobic processes impose N2O 100 \nconsumption in these forest soils through denitrification; b) that soils with low available    101 \nmineral N as substrate for N2O production during denitrification under anoxic conditions 102 \nmay force full reduction and uptake of atmospheric N2O; and c) that high organic C 103 \ncontents in the soil may increase microbially available energy stores and encourage 104 \natmospheric N2O consumption, when soils undergo NO3 limitation. To test these 105 \nhypotheses, we measured potential N2O consumption rates in sixteen soil samples 106 \ncollected from 4 soil types [two organic and two mineral] in the MSH and MA sites in 107 \nlaboratory incubations under elevated headspace N2O concentrations to establish their 108 \npotentials for N2O consumption and to identify key conditions that favor this 109 \nconsumption.  110 \n 111 \nMATERIALS AND METHODS 112 \nStudy Sites 113 \nThe two sites used in this study are representative of southern Qu\u00e9bec mixed 114 \ndeciduous forest with a combination of tree species: American beech, sugar maple, 115 \nyellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis), striped maple (Acer pensylvanicum), white ash 116 \n(Fraxinus americana) and eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis). The Mont St. Hilaire site 117 \nis located within an old growth forest occurring on one of the Monteregian hills, 118 \napproximately 30 km east of Montreal. Two types of well-drained soils were sampled at 119 \nthis site: a sandy loam Brunisol underlying beech-dominated stands and a Podzol 120 \nunderlying hemlock-dominated stands, referred to as \u2018beech\u2019 and \u2018hemlock\u2019, respectively. 121 \nThe Morgan Arboretum site occurs in semi-managed forest located on the western tip of 122 \nthe island of Montreal. Sugar maple is the dominant tree species at this site, overlying 123 \nwell-drained, sandy loam soils referred to as \u2018maple\u2019. 124 \n 125 \nSoil collection and preparation 126 \nFour plots (1 m\n2\n each) were randomly selected for each of the three soils. In 127 \nNovember 2007, soil cores (10 cm diameter) were taken randomly from each of four 128 \nplots to a depth of 10 cm and bulked, transferred to the laboratory and refrigerated until 129 \n 6 \nfurther analysis. While the upper 10 cm of the maple (mineral) and hemlock (organic) 130 \nsoils showed no soil horizon change, the beech soils contained an organic horizon (O-131 \nhorizon) overlying the mineral soil horizon (A-horizon). For these beech cores, the soil 132 \nwas separated into the organic (0 to 5 cm) and mineral (5 to 10 cm) horizons for separate 133 \nanalysis. The four resulting soils used in this study are: beech mineral, beech organic, 134 \nhemlock organic and maple mineral. Each of the 16 soil samples (4 plots each for 4 soil 135 \ntypes) was homogenized manually and sieved (< 2 mm), then analyzed for soil moisture 136 \nand pH in water and extracted and analyzed for total dissolved N (TDN), dissolved 137 \norganic C (DOC), NO3 and NH4 contents, as described in Ullah et al. (2008). Samples 138 \ncollected from 4 sampling points in each plot for N2O consumption incubation and soil 139 \nanalysis incorporated the spatial variability within each plot. 140 \n 141 \nSoil Leaching and Pre-incubations  142 \nSoil leaching and pre-incubations were performed in January 2008 on field moist 143 \nsoil samples collected from the four locations in the two watersheds to create conditions 144 \nthat favor N2O consumption hypothesized above, including NO3 limitation and anoxic 145 \nconditions, before testing individual hypotheses under 8 treatments. To leach NO3, 30 g 146 \nof a soil at a time was leached by gravity in 60 ml syringes with the plungers removed 147 \nand a Whatman GF\/D filter placed at the tip. Three sequential washes of 15 ml de-ionized 148 \nwater (DI) were passed through the soils before returning them to field moisture 149 \nconditions by applying pressure with the syringe plungers. Leachates were collected to 150 \nensure that soils were returned to field moisture conditions; these leachates were 151 \nsubsequently acidified and analyzed for DOC and TDN contents. After leaching, 15 g of 152 \nsoils was weighed into 150 ml serum bottles and 20 ml of DI was added. The bottles were 153 \ncapped tight, flushed with oxygen-free N2 gas for 1 hour to induce anoxic conditions and 154 \nincubated at room temperature for 5 days to further exhaust soil NO3 through 155 \ndenitrification. Gas samples for N2O concentration determination were collected from the 156 \nheadspace of the pre-incubated leached soil samples at 0, 24, 72 and 120 hours for one set 157 \nof incubations, to test for the expected NO3-depletion process occurring in the soils. 158 \nAfter leaching and pre-incubation, soils were incubated under 8 treatments, 159 \nincluding 6 treatments applied to the leached and pre-incubated soil samples, 1 treatment 160 \n 7 \nto unleached but pre-incubated samples and 1 treatment to unleached and not pre-161 \nincubated soil. A brief description and rationale of each treatment follows, with the 162 \nprocedures used: 163 \n1 Baseline 164 \nThis treatment involved incubation of leached and pre-incubated soils under 165 \nelevated headspace N2O concentrations to investigate if NO3 limitation and anoxic 166 \nconditions would result in larger potential N2O consumption rates. 15 g of leached and 167 \npre-incubated soil was weighed into a 150 ml serum bottle, followed by the addition of 168 \n20 ml of DI water. The bottles were capped with a gas-tight septa, flushed with oxygen-169 \nfree N2 gas for 1 hour to induce anoxic condition. After flushing, the headspace N2O 170 \nconcentration in the bottles was raised to 2 ppm to ensure unlimited supply of N2O and be 171 \nable to quantify potential N2O consumption rates. The incubation was performed on soil 172 \nslurries on a rotary shaker at 75 rpm to encourage equilibrium solubility of the headspace 173 \ngases. The incubation period lasted 24 hours, with 5 cm\n3\n gas samples taken at 0, 6, 12 174 \nand 24 hours, stored in pre-evacuated glass vials until analysis for N2O concentration on 175 \na Shimadzu 14-A gas chromatograph  equipped with a 6 m long porapack Q column and 176 \nan electron capture detector. The end of the the GC  column had a 4 valve electronic 177 \nValco Valve attached to it, which was timed to vent off  separated O2 coming out of 178 \ncolumn to avoid loss in the dector sensitivity for N2O detection. Once the O2  was vented 179 \noff, the valve swiched back and directed the subsequently separated N2O in the column 180 \ninto the detector. The column temperature was adjusted to 60 \no\nC and that of the detector 181 \nto 310 \no\nC. Rate of N2O consumption or emission was calculated from the change in 182 \nconcentration over the sampling duration using a linear equation obtained through a 183 \ncalibration curve of  known N2O standards. 184 \n2 Glucose-amended 185 \nThis treatment repeats the baseline conditions, with an additional amendment of 186 \nglucose (approx. 0.8 mg C\/g dry soil) to identify the effects of increased C availability, 187 \ndelivered through a needle-fitted syringe to distribute the solution evenly throughout the 188 \nsoil slurry.   189 \n3 NO3-amended 190 \nThis treatment repeats the baseline conditions, with an additional amendment of KNO3 191 \n 8 \nsolution (approx. 15 \u00b5g NO3-N \/g dry soil), delivered through a needle-fitted syringe. 192 \nThis treatment is a test of whether N2O consumption is reduced when inorganic N is 193 \nreadily available. 194 \n4 Unleached 195 \nThis treatment repeats the baseline conditions on soils, which were unleached, but pre-196 \nincubated to isolate the effects of this method of N-limitation. 197 \n5 No N2O amendment 198 \nThis treatment repeats the baseline conditions, excluding amendment of bottle 199 \nheadspaces with N2O, with headspace composed entirely of N2 gas. 200 \n6 Field moisture, aerobic 201 \nThis treatment is designed to remove the gas diffusion limitation imposed in the baseline 202 \nincubation. This was done by incubating the soils at field moisture instead of under slurry 203 \nconditions and under aerobic headspace conditions (but still amended with N2O). Soils in 204 \nthis treatment were unleached and not pre-incubated. 205 \n7 Unleached, field moisture, no N2O amendment 206 \nThis treatment represents field conditions, with unleached soils incubated at field 207 \nmoisture under aerobic and unamended conditions with ambient air headspace. 208 \n8 Acetylene-amended 209 \nThis treatment repeats the baseline conditions but with the additional amendment of 10% 210 \nacetylene in the headspace to inhibit the reduction of N2O to N2 and block nitrification, 211 \nthereby isolating the role of denitrification and confirming that N2O consumption 212 \noccurred through denitrification and not nitrification. 213 \n 214 \nStatistical analysis 215 \nThe gas flux from each bottle was calculated as the slope of the linear regression 216 \nline best fitting the sample points over 24 hours. Average consumption or emission rates 217 \nand standard errors were calculated based on the four replicates for each soil type and 218 \ntreatment. A small constant (the value of the largest emission) was added to each one to 219 \nrender all values positive; values were then log-transformed to meet the assumption of 220 \nnormality. These values were compared by ANOVA and Fisher LSD using Statistica 6, 221 \nboth for differences in fluxes within soil type, by treatment, and among soil types, for 222 \n 9 \neach treatment. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated in SAS 9.1. 223 \n 224 \nRESULTS 225 \nThe hemlock organic soil sample had the highest DOC content (321 \u00b5g C g\n-1\n dry 226 \nsoil), followed by beech organic (180 \u00b5g C g\n-1\n dry soil), with beech and maple mineral 227 \nsamples having the lowest DOC content (49 and 41 \u00b5g C g\n-1\n dry soil, respectively; Table 228 \n1). The same trend is observed for TDN, with the hemlock organic soil having the highest 229 \ncontent (17.8 \u00b5g N g\n-1\n dry soil) and maple the lowest (5.7 \u00b5g N g\n-1\n dry soil). In terms of 230 \nNO3 and NH4 contents, however, the hemlock organic soil had the lowest values (0.9 and 231 \n3.1 \u00b5g N g\n-1\n dry soil, respectively), with beech mineral (3.7 and 5.9 \u00b5g N g\n-1\n dry soil) and 232 \norganic (3.4 and 5.6 \u00b5g N g\n-1\n dry soil) exhibiting the highest contents of both ions, trailed 233 \nby maple mineral, which showed slightly lower contents (2.7 and 5.0 \u00b5g N g\n-1\n dry soil).  234 \nLeaching slightly reduced DOC and TDN contents for all soils, though the hemlock 235 \norganic soil showed a large reduction in DOC content (80 \u00b5g C g\n-1\n dry soil) with leaching 236 \n(Table 1).   237 \nN2O exchange from pre-incubated soils was low, ranging from a net emission of 238 \n0.22 ng N2O-N g\n-1\n d\n-1\n from the hemlock soil to a net consumption of 1.8 ng N2O-N g\n-1\n d\n-1\n 239 \nfrom the beech mineral soil. Pre-incubated leached soils showed significantly smaller 240 \nN2O fluxes than those incubated under elevated headspace N2O (Fig. 1). Substantial net 241 \nN2O consumption was observed in the soils under the conditions hypothesized to 242 \nfacilitate N2O reduction: treatment 1 with anoxic conditions and with 2 ppm N2O-243 \namended headspace (Fig. 1). The greatest potential for N2O consumption was found in 244 \nthe hemlock organic soil, with a consumption of 111 ng N2O-N g\n-1\n d\n-1\n (Fig. 1c), 245 \nsignificantly larger (p < 0.05) than the beech organic soil with 74.5 ng N2O-N g\n-1\n d\n-1\n (Fig. 246 \n1 b). The N2O consumption rate was significantly slower in the two mineral soils: beech 247 \n(45.2 ng N2O-N g\n-1\n d\n-1\n) and maple (40.7 ng N2O-N g\n-1\n d\n-1\n, Fig. 1a, d). 248 \nWhen soils were incubated at field moisture or under aerobic conditions, the N2O 249 \nconsumption rate decreased greatly in all soils, even in the presence of high 250 \nconcentrations of N2O in the headspace (treatments 6 and 7, Fig. 1). When the headspace 251 \nremained unamended with N2O, most soils switched to slow rates of N2O emission, 252 \ndespite saturated and anoxic conditions (Treatment 5).  For the incubation at field 253 \n 10 \nmoisture, under aerobic, unamended conditions, the average fluxes were near-zero for all 254 \nsoils (Incubation 7). Leaching with H2O appeared to slightly increase the potential for 255 \nN2O consumption for most soils, but the average flux was significantly different from 256 \nthat of the unleached soils only for the beech mineral soil (Treatment 4, Fig. 1a).  257 \nThe addition of organic C in the form of glucose (treatment 2) yielded a slightly 258 \nfaster N2O consumption rate in the two beech soils, but was statistically indistinguishable 259 \nfrom the baseline treatment 1 for all soils (Fig. 1). The addition of NO3 solution to the 260 \nsoils clearly decreased the N2O consumption rate for all soils, though not significantly 261 \n(treatment 3). The addition of headspace acetylene (treatment 8) resulted in near-zero 262 \nN2O fluxes in all soils, canceling the strong consumption observed in treatment 1 and was 263 \nstatistically significant (p < 0.05) in all cases. 264 \nThere were few significant differences in N2O fluxes among the four soils for 265 \neach treatment: significant (p < 0.05) differences occurred only in treatments 1, 2 and 4, 266 \nwith the hemlock and beech organic soils generally with the largest potential 267 \nconsumption rates (Fig. 1). 268 \nA correlation analysis revealed that the potential N2O consumption rates under 269 \ntreatment 1 are significantly and negatively correlated with both DOC and original soil 270 \nmoisture, suggesting that soils with higher C contents and field moisture levels have a 271 \ngreater capacity to consume N2O (Table 2). In addition, TDN showed a similar negative 272 \ncorrelation with N2O fluxes, though only significant at the 10% level. 273 \n 274 \nDISCUSSION 275 \nThe strong potential N2O consumption rates obtained from the baseline incubation 276 \nreveal that these well-drained forest soils have a significant capacity for N2O reduction 277 \nunder conditions of anoxia and N limitation. Though conditions in this laboratory study 278 \nare incomparable in many ways to field conditions, the occurrence of potential N2O 279 \nconsumption rates at such magnitude suggests that these processes could play a 280 \nsignificant role in determining net fluxes of N2O from the soils, even though these soils 281 \nare weak net sources of N2O throughout most of the growing season. This result suggest a 282 \nneed for in situ N2O consumption studies and the inclusion of N2O reduction processes in 283 \nthe consideration of N cycling and gas fluxes in these soils, and forest soils in general. 284 \n 11 \nThe conditions which facilitated N2O reduction in this study included: a) the 285 \nimposition of enhanced N2O consumption, through anaerobiosis and soil water 286 \nsaturation; b) low availability of electron acceptors, notably NO3, achieved by leaching 287 \nand pre-incubating soils; and c) high organic C contents to encourage reduction of N2O as 288 \nan alternate electron acceptor. The baseline incubation (treatment 1) showed that the 289 \ncombination of these factors yielded significant consumption in all four soils, both 290 \nmineral and organic. The near-zero N2O fluxes obtained under conditions similar to those 291 \nin the field (treatment 7) represented a clear contrast to the baseline incubation. The 292 \nremaining six treatments served to identify the effect of the different variables on 293 \npotential N2O consumption. 294 \nThe glucose addition (treatment 2) increased N2O consumption levels only (and 295 \nthen not statistically significant) in the beech soils, both organic and mineral. Soil C:N 296 \nratios (Table 1) influenced N2O consumption, where beech and hemlock showed faster 297 \nconsumption rates and their C:N ratios were larger than those of soils under sugar maple. 298 \nCavigelli and Robertson (2001) also noted that the Nos enzyme is particularly sensitive to 299 \na low C:N ratio and stated that the organic C level in a soil is an important factor for soil 300 \ndenitrifier populations. This might explain the low baseline N2O consumption of the 301 \nmaple mineral soil, as well as the absence of an increase in consumption upon glucose 302 \namendment. The hemlock organic soil may not have shown increased N2O consumption 303 \nupon glucose addition, owing to the high DOC levels of organic C in these soils. Larger 304 \nnitrification rates in soils under the sugar maple compared to those under American beech 305 \nand hemlock in these plots may have led to the evolution of denitrifiers with low affinity 306 \nfor N2O consumption in soils under sugar maple trees (Ullah and Moore, 2009). 307 \nAdditionally, in situ N2O consumption rates in soils under American beech were 2 times 308 \nlarger than under sugar maple in these sites (Ullah and Moore, in prep). We hypothesize 309 \nthat soils with larger soil C content and C:N ratio in deciduous forests consume more 310 \nN2O than soils under smaller C:N ratios. We suggest further microbial studies to validate 311 \nthis hypothesis under field conditions. 312 \nOur strong correlation between N2O consumption and extractable DOC 313 \nconcentration, within the limited range of soils, is consistent with reports on the 314 \nimportance of organic C (as well as moisture, oxygen, disturbance and pH levels) in 315 \n 12 \ndetermining N2O consumption potentials, which may also reflect differences in microbial 316 \ncommunities among soil types (Parkin 1987, Cavigelli and Robertson 2001, Wallenstein 317 \net al. 2006). Given the limited, non-significant increases in N2O consumption upon 318 \nglucose amendment in the beech soils, further experiments are needed to determine 319 \nwhether different and larger organic C amendments would have a significant effect, or 320 \nwhether the microbial populations present in the soils limit the response over the 24-hour 321 \nincubation period. 322 \nThe addition of NO3 (treatment 3) and the incubation of unleached soils 323 \n(treatment 4) were performed to contrast N2O consumption with those of the baseline 324 \nincubation (treatment 1), where an effort was made to eliminate as much NO3 from the 325 \nsoils as possible. This was to test whether denitrifiers will turn to an alternate, though less 326 \nenergetically favorable electron acceptor, the N2O provided through headspace 327 \namendment (Bandibas et al. 1994), a technique of limiting the availability of electron 328 \nacceptors successfully employed in other studies (e.g. Firestone et al. 1980, Holtan-329 \nHartwig et al. 2000). This hypothesis was supported by our results, showing a decreasing 330 \ntrend, although not statistically significant at p < 0.05, in treatments 3 and 4 (Figure 1).  331 \nThe near-zero N2O fluxes in pre-incubation conditions support the hypothesis that this 332 \ntreatment lowered NO3 in the soil, allowing the uptake and reduction of N2O as an 333 \nalternate electron acceptor in the following treatments. Leaching the soils clearly 334 \ndepressed total N levels in all cases (Table 1). The differences in N2O consumption 335 \nbetween the leached, pre-incubated soils and the same soils with NO3 added, reflect the 336 \ncontrol of NO3-availability: adding NO3 after leaching and pre-incubating the soils 337 \neffectively cancels out the effect of the initial leaching. There was a decrease in N2O 338 \nconsumption by about one third upon NO3 addition in the beech soils, whereas the effect 339 \nwas less pronounced in the hemlock and maple soils.   340 \n  Thus, while NO3 availability is significant, other conditions such as anaerobiosis, 341 \nmoisture and N2O play key roles in determining whether N2O consumption will occur. 342 \nThe correlation between low NO3 levels and N2O consumption is widely cited, but most 343 \nstudies go on to describe the conditions of anaerobiosis and saturation as predominantly 344 \nimportant (Blackmer and Bremner 1976, Firestone et al. 1980, Bandibas et al. 1994, 345 \nHoltan-Hartwig et al. 2000, Rosenkranz et al. 2006, Wallenstein et al. 2006). A possible 346 \n 13 \nreason why a major decrease in N2O consumption was not observed in treatments 3 and 4 347 \nis that the NO3 was quickly exhausted, leading to a NO3-limitation similar to that of the 348 \nbaseline and creating larger N2O consumption later during the 24-hour incubation. 349 \nFirestone et al. (1980) suggested that Nos enzyme could be sequentially produced during 350 \nthe incubation, resulting first in an increase and then a decrease in headspace N2O 351 \nconcentration. We recommend further studies with \n15\nN tracers to validate this hypothesis. 352 \nExcess N2O appears to be critical in its consumption as an alternate electron 353 \nreceptor upon NO3-limitation (Mei et al. 2004). This is reflected in treatment 5, without 354 \nthe N2O headspace amendment, where, for all but the hemlock soil, there was a small 355 \nN2O production (Fig. 1) indicating that, all other conditions being equal, when N2O is not 356 \nabundantly available in the soil pore spaces, N2O consumption will likely be small, or is 357 \nseverely limited. The leaching and pre-incubation is effective at reducing available NO3 358 \nas a substrate for denitrification but the small rates of N2O indicate that complete 359 \nreduction to N2 (and thus N2O consumption) may be limited due to lower soil pore space 360 \nN2O concentrations. Indeed, the lack of substrates for denitrifiers under treatment 5 likely 361 \nlimited their activity in either the production or consumption, resulting in the fluxes. For 362 \nthe hemlock soil, the large standard error makes the interpretation of the small 363 \nconsumption rates for this incubation ambiguous, but perhaps suggests that complete 364 \nreduction can occur under these circumstances, if enough organic C is available to 365 \nencourage microbial activity, but this is variable and ephemeral. Fast denitrification rates 366 \nare often associated with high organic C in soils (Parkin 1987, Wrage et al. 2001) and 367 \nmore work could be done to establish the effect of varying the headspace N2O 368 \nconcentrations, from 2 ppm (treatment 1) to ambient. 369 \nIn treatment 6, soils were incubated aerobically and at field moisture to identify 370 \nthe effect of anoxic conditions, resulting in a significant decrease in N2O consumption. 371 \nAnoxic conditions play a critical role in N2O consumption in soils, for which there is 372 \nsupport in the literature: 373 \na) When oxygen is allowed to diffuse into the soil, denitrifier activity and Nos activity in 374 \nparticular are impeded and restricted to microsites of anoxia (Firestone et al. 1979, 375 \nBandibas et al. 1994, Cavigelli and Robertson 2001). 376 \nb) Low moisture allows greater gas diffusion into and out of the soil profile and any 377 \n 14 \nremaining NO3 reduced to N2O is able to diffuse out of the soil without further reduction 378 \nto N2, whereas higher moisture content facilitates N2O entrapment and reduction to N2 379 \n(Clough et al. 2005; Ullah et al. 2005). 380 \nc) N2O present in the headspace diffuses into the soil profile more easily under low 381 \nmoisture conditions, which paradoxically may tend to encourage consumption in the drier 382 \nsoils by increasing the availability of the N2O as a substrate in the redox chain (Bandibas 383 \net al. 2004). This could be the reason why N2O fluxes remained negative, though reduced 384 \nin magnitude, in treatment 6. This effect is evidenced further in treatment 7, where in 385 \naddition to the removal of the gas diffusion limitation, the N2O headspace amendment is 386 \nremoved (as well as leaching), and fluxes diminish to near-zero or slight production. 387 \nClough et al. (2005) suggest that this is due to the decreased time in which potential 388 \nreduction can occur under low moisture conditions because of increased gas diffusion and 389 \nprevalence of oxic conditions in soil profile. 390 \nd) Though the presence of anoxic conditions appears to exert a stronger control over N2O 391 \nconsumption than NO3 availability, the NO3-limitation is likely required initially to 392 \nencourage N2O consumption as the predominant denitrifier activity in anoxic, saturated 393 \nconditions, as suggested in treatments 3 and 4. The two controls are interdependent, and 394 \ntheir importance can both be traced to the availability of the various reactants in the 395 \ndenitrification redox chain, which in all cases is concentration and diffusion-dependent. 396 \nThe addition of acetylene in treatment 8 inhibited the reduction of N2O to N2 and 397 \nremoved the strong N2O consumption under treatment 1 (Schuster and Conrad 1992).  398 \nThis eliminates the possibility that other factors, such as simple diffusion into soil water, 399 \nis causing the decrease in concentration of N2O in the headspace over the incubation 400 \nperiod, confirming that the N2O is in fact being reduced to N2 through denitrification.  401 \nDenitrification is clearly implicated as the process by which this reduction occurs under 402 \nbaseline conditions since the acetylene amendment also inhibits nitrification processes. 403 \nN2O is not accumulating in the headspace, implying that the N2O being reduced in 404 \ntreatment 1 was primarily amended headspace N2O through denitrification. 405 \nThese well-drained soils are capable of consuming N2O, so the summer field 406 \nconsumption that first motivated this study are likely not anomalous. Although great care 407 \nneeds to be taken in extrapolating these results to field conditions, the potential for N2O 408 \n 15 \nconsumption in the field likely results from denitrification processes occurring in isolated 409 \nanoxic, wet microsites within the soil, where locally produced N2O can be retained and 410 \nreduced to N2. This N2O consumption is usually not detectable in the field as emission 411 \nrates are slow emissions, though the emission rate may be decreased by N2O 412 \nconsumption (Ullah et al. in prep.). Net field N2O consumption could be anticipated after 413 \nheavy rainfall, where soils are strongly NO3-limited and with large organic C contents 414 \n(Seitzinger et al. 2006).   415 \n 416 \nCONCLUSIONS 417 \nWell-drained forest soils in southern Qu\u00e9bec exhibited potential N2O 418 \nconsumption through denitrification when incubated under anoxic and saturated moisture 419 \nconditions, and when amended with high levels of atmospheric N2O. Mineral N 420 \nlimitation within the soils likely stimulated the reduction of N2O to N2. Organic soils 421 \nshowed generally greater N2O consumption potentials than mineral soils. Conditions 422 \nfavoring N2O consumption may occur in wet, anaerobic microsites within the soil profile, 423 \nand such consumption processes could bear significantly on the net flux of N2O from 424 \nthese soils. Our results also suggest that soil with larger soil C:N ratios exhibiting lower 425 \nnitrification rates may possess higher affinity for N2O consumption than soils with 426 \nsmaller ratios. 427 \n 428 \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 429 \nMany thanks to Mike Dalva and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Lalande for laboratory assistance and to 430 \nDr. M.
