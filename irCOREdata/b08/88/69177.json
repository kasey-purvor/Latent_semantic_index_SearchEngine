Introduction\n[2] Radio tomography is a relatively new experimental\ntechnique, developed in recent years to image structures\nin the electron density of the ionized atmosphere. The\nparticular application of the method used here involves\nthe monitoring of signals from satellites in low Earth\norbit at a linear chain of stations to measure the total\nelectron content along the intersecting ray paths. The\nresultant data set is then inverted in a reconstruction\nalgorithm to create an image in two dimensions of the\nspatial structures in the ionospheric electron density.\nProgress in the development of the technique can be\nfollowed in a number of review papers [Kersley and\nPryse, 1994; Leitinger, 1999; Pryse, 2003]. Radio\ntomography has been demonstrated to have relevance\nboth to the study of the geophysical processes control-\nling the ionized atmosphere and to radio science appli-\ncations of propagation effects on practical radio\nsystems. Several of the former studies have been at\nhigh latitudes where the images of signatures in the\nionized atmosphere have been used to investigate\neffects of space weather on the terrestrial environment.\nRecently, the efforts of individual research groups\nworking in the field have been coordinated through\nthe auspices of the International Ionospheric Tomogra-\nphy Community (IITC).

Experiment and Analysis\n[3] Most of the current activity in the field of exper-\nimental radio tomography makes use of radio trans-\nmissions from satellites in the Navy Ionospheric\nMonitoring System, a constellation of six satellites in\npolar orbits at altitudes of about 1100 km. Monitoring of\nthe signals on 150 and 400 MHz enables measurement of\nthe electron content along the ionospheric ray paths by\nmeans of the differential carrier phase technique. During\nthe IITC campaign, three groups operated the chains of\nground receiving stations at northern high latitudes\nshown in the map of Figure 1. The University of Wales,\nAberystwyth (UWA) were responsible for four receiving\nsystems located in the European sector at sites in\nnorthern Scandinavia, ranging from Tromso (70\u0001N)\npoleward to Ny Alesund (79\u0001N). The Applied Research\nLaboratories (ARL) of the University of Texas at Austin\noperated a chain of four stations in western Greenland,\ncovering geographic latitudes from 61\u0001N to 69\u0001N, to\nwhich have been added data from a station operated at\nQaanaaq (77\u0001N) by NorthWest Research Associates Inc.\n(NWRA). The third chain, in Alaska with five receivers\nbetween about 61\u0001N and 70\u0001N, was established and\nmaintained by NWRA in collaboration with the Geo-\nphysical Institute of the University of Alaska, Fairbanks.\n[4] The dates 19 and 20 September 2001 were chosen\nfor the first campaign to coincide with internationally\ncoordinated World Days, when observations from differ-\nent instruments monitoring a wide range of geophysical\nparameters were likely to be available to aid interpreta-\ntion of the tomographic results. The receiving systems at\nall of the sites operated automatically to make measure-\nments using a random selection of satellite passes, giving\nwide temporal coverage of conditions in the ionosphere\nat each of the geographic sectors throughout the period\nof interest. The analysis of the observations from the\ndifferent station chains was carried out by each of the\ngroups concerned. Tomographic images of the electron\ndensity in a height versus latitude plane in the longitude\nsector of the station chain were generated for each of\nthe passes recorded. Using well-established techniques,\ninformation about the spatial distribution of the ioniza-\ntion can be obtained for a latitudinal range that extends\nsome 5\u0001 to 7\u0001 wider than that of the stations, beyond\nwhich the fidelity of the image degrades gradually.\nWhile there were some differences in detail to the\nprocedures used, the reconstruction algorithms were\nall based essentially on the discrete inverse theory\n(DIT) method described by Fremouw et al. [1992].\n3. Results\n[5] The procedure outlined above produced a wealth of\ninformation about spatial structures seen in the electron\ndensity in different sectors of the high-latitude iono-\nsphere on the days in question. A limited selection of\nobservations is presented here to demonstrate the poten-\ntial of such coordinated semiglobal measurements using\nthe radio tomographic technique. The results are related\nto those from an independent experimental technique and\nalso to model studies of the high-latitude ionosphere.\n[6] Tomographic images obtained from the three\nreceiver chains just after 0800 UT on 20 September\n2001 are presented in Figures 2a\u20132c. The ionosphere\nover northern Europe, imaged from a satellite pass at\nabout 0806 UT (Figure 2a), shows a horizontally\nstratified structure with a broad minimum in electron\ndensity at the layer peak centered at about 68\u0001N\ngeomagnetic latitude. Farther to the north, the densities\nmaximize around 75\u0001N, the peak value being about\n1012 m\u00013, with a second minimum to be seen at about\n79\u0001N. The tomographic image from western Greenland\nat about 0815 UT (Figure 2b) shows an ionosphere of\ndifferent character. Electron densities to the south are\nlow in a horizontally stratified ionosphere with a peak\nbetween 350 km and 400 km altitude. A broad trough\ncan be seen, culminating in a steep poleward wall at\nFigure 1. Map showing the locations of the three\nchains of satellite receiving stations making the measure-\nments used for the radio tomographic studies.\nRS5003 KERSLEY ET AL.: RADIO TOMOGRAPHIC IMAGING OF IONOSPHERE\n2 of 9\nRS5003\nabout 79\u0001N geomagnetic latitude and a marked enhance-\nment near the northern extremity of the image. The\nelectron densities found in the image from the Alaskan\nsector (Figure 2c), obtained around 0809 UT using\nobservations monitored at the southern stations of the\nchain, reveal a stratified ionosphere to the south, with a\nvery narrow trough of depleted densities near 67\u0001N\ngeomagnetic latitude a localized enhancement near 68\u0001,\nanother depletion near 70\u0001, and denser plasma to the\nnorth.\n[7] Interpretation of these results, made at essentially\nthe same universal time but widely separated in geo-\ngraphic locations, requires understanding of their context\nin the frame of the physical processes controlling the\ndynamics of the ionosphere at high latitudes. Plasma\nconvection, driven by the interaction of the solar wind\nwith the magnetosphere, is one such key mechanism.\nMeasurements of the interplanetary magnetic field by the\nACE satellite, upstream in the solar wind, confirmed that\nBz was weakly negative (\u00021 nT) at the time of the\nobservations, after allowing for an appropriate time delay\nbetween the ACE location and the ionospheric response.\nIt is thus likely that a two-cell convection pattern was\nestablished, drawing plasma from the dayside for subse-\nquent transport across the polar cap in the antisunward\nflow. By was also weakly negative (\u00021 nT), so the\nresultant asymmetry of the convection pattern would be\nexpected to rotate the throat region slightly to earlier\nlocal magnetic times [Cowley, 1997]. Figure 3 shows a\npolar plot, in geomagnetic coordinates, of the equipo-\ntentials of the convection pattern at northern high\nlatitudes, obtained from the model by Weimer [1996]\nfor conditions appropriate to the present study. The\napproximate tracks of the ionospheric intersections of\nthe ray paths from the satellites to the three receiver\nchains are also shown. While caution must be exercised\nin examination of the detailed features of the modeled\npattern, particularly at latitudes lower than those of the\ntwin cells at polar latitudes, nevertheless the pattern can\nbe used on a large scale to interpret the tomographic\nimages. It should be noted that experimental observa-\ntions to provide confirmation of the convection pattern\nwould have been useful. However, actual measurements\nof plasma drifts at high latitudes from the SuperDARN\nradars were not available for the time of interest here.\n[8] It can be seen from Figure 3 that the observations\nin the European sector represent a transect through the\ndayside cusp ionosphere just before magnetic noon. In\nGreenland, the image corresponds to a section through\nthe dawn convection cell in the morning sector. The\nAlaskan observations are at earlier local times, with\nthe southern part of the image plane cutting across the\nFigure 2a. Tomographic images of electron density obtained from satellite passes just after\n0800 UT on 20 September 2001 from the station chains in the European sector.\nRS5003 KERSLEY ET AL.: RADIO TOMOGRAPHIC IMAGING OF IONOSPHERE\n3 of 9\nRS5003\nauroral zone at the edge of the afternoon convection cell\nin the late evening. Using this understanding of the\ngeometry of the sections in relation to physical processes\noperating in the high-latitude ionosphere, it can be\ninferred that the image from the European stations\n(Figure 2a) shows a broad trough about 68\u0001N geomag-\nnetic latitude in the region where the flux tubes are likely\nto be returning from the nightside near the edge of the\ndawn cell of the high-latitude convection pattern. The\ndensity enhancement, between about 70\u0001N and 77\u0001N,\nwith a maximum near 75\u0001N, may well correspond to a\nsection through a tongue of ionization from the dayside\nafternoon sector being drawn into the throat region of\nthe high-latitude convective flow.\n[9] The image from the Greenland stations (Figure 2b)\nshows low densities in a trough with a poleward wall\nsurmounted by an enhancement. Figure 3 confirms that\nthe section imaged here intersects the dawn cell of the\nconvection pattern. It is thus possible that the depleted\ndensities at latitudes less than about 76\u0001N geomagnetic\nlatitude relate to flux tubes returning from the nightside\nin darkness within the dawn cell. Farther to the north, the\nenhanced densities seen in the image may be linked to a\ntongue or possibly a patch of high-density plasma that\nhas been caught in the antisunward flow of the central\npolar cap. It can be noted that the height of the layer peak\nis greater than 300 km, so the lifetime of the plasma\ncould be many tens of minutes.\n[10] The image from the stations in Alaska (Figure 2c)\nalso shows a trough extending from near 67\u0001N to about\n71\u0001N geomagnetic latitude, albeit containing a localized\nenhancement. Figure 3 confirms that this image is of the\nionosphere at the auroral zone edge of the dusk convec-\ntion cell. In this sector, the sunward return convection at\nhigh latitudes and corotation to the south combine to\nproduce counterstreaming flows where the plasma on\nslow-moving flux tubes depletes in darkness enabling the\nformation of the main trough in the nightside ionosphere.\nThe latitudinally narrow enhancement residing in the\ntrough region is characteristic of structures observed\nrather frequently in this premidnight sector of the auroral\nzone.\n[11] Further interpretation of the tomographic observa-\ntions can be aided by model studies. The Sheffield\nUniversity version of the coupled thermosphere iono-\nsphere plasmasphere model (CTIP) model has been used\nto estimate the electron densities for conditions appro-\npriate to the present experimental tomographic observa-\ntions. CTIP is a \u2018\u2018first- principles\u2019\u2019 global model of the\ncoupled thermosphere-ionosphere-plasmasphere system,\ndetails of which can be found in papers by Millward et\nal. [1996] and Fuller-Rowell et al. [1996]. In the model,\nFigure 2b.

The resolution is 2\u0001 in latitude, 18\u0001 in\nlongitude and one scale height, from a lower boundary\nfixed at 80 km and 1 Pa.\n[12] The results of the CTIP model runs, appropriate to\nthe conditions of the current study, are presented as polar\nplots of electron densities at 350 km for northern high\nlatitudes. The universal time corresponds to 0800 UT,\nwith Figure 4a plotted for the geographic\/LT frame,\nwhile Figure 4b gives the same results in a geomagnetic\nlatitude\/MLT reference frame. It is beyond the purposes\nof the present initial study to compare details or to\ndiscuss the ability of the model to give precise replica-\ntion of the experimental observations; nevertheless, the\ngeneral form of the model plots can be used to aid\ninterpretation of the tomographic images.\n[13] Figure 4a shows that, in the European sector, the\nsection of the image cuts through the morningside of the\ndaytime sunlit ionosphere at lower latitudes and inter-\nsects a region of high-density plasma extending west-\nward at high latitude. The corresponding plot in the\ngeomagnetic reference frame shows that this feature is\nindeed the tongue of ionization of solar-produced plasma\nfrom the dayside being carried in the cross-polar flow by\nthe high-latitude convection. For Greenland, the model\nresults of Figure 4a suggest that the section being imaged\nis effectively through the auroral oval into the enhanced\ndensities at higher latitudes, consistent with the tomo-\ngraphic observations.\n[14] The situation over Alaska is more complex. The\nmodel results indicate that the convective flow is that of\nthe dusk cell just before the Harang discontinuity, with\nthe scan along the edge of depleted densities in the\nmiddle of the image and somewhat higher densities at\nthe highest latitudes. The experimental results show\nmidlatitude densities decreasing poleward near midpass\nto a trough containing an isolated blob-like enhancement\nand then densities increasing at the highest latitudes.\nWhile detailed comparisons are beyond the current\ncapabilities of the model, a possible interpretation is that\nthe isolated enhancement represents a polar cap patch of\nhigh-density plasma that has been transported across\nfrom the European sector in the antisunward convection,\nalthough the image suggests a structure linked to local\nsoft precipitation as a possible mechanism.\n[15] Another comparison can be made between the\ntomographic results and maps of total electron content\n(TEC) for the northern polar sector, created from mea-\nFigure 2c.

The observational data\nwere provided by the growing global network of GPS\nground stations of the International GPS Service (IGS).\nAfter determining the total electron content along a\nnumber of ray paths, using a Kalman filter technique\nfor calibrating the ionospheric delay of GPS signals\n[Sardo\u00b4n et al., 1994], the slant TEC is mapped to the\nvertical by a single-layer approximation for the iono-\nsphere at 400 km altitude. Using the GPS ground stations\nof the European and northern high-latitude IGS network,\nbetween 60 and 200 data points of TEC are obtained,\ncovering the northern polar cap at latitudes greater than\n50\u0001N. To map the TEC, a preliminary model for the polar\nTEC has been established, in a similar way to the one\ndeveloped earlier for the European area [Jakowski,\n1996]. Using this procedure, polar maps of vertical\nTEC were derived for a grid consisting of 768 points\nwithin the range 50\u0001N to 90\u0001N. It is estimated that the\nerrors in the mapping should be less than some 3 TEC\nunits, enabling the study of large-scale ionospheric\nphenomena [Jakowski et al., 2002].\n[16] Figure 5a shows such a map, contoured from GPS\nTEC observations made at 0800 UT on 20 September\n2001. The plot has similarities to the general form of the\nFigure 3.

The latitude ranges from\n57\u0001N to the pole.\nFigure 4.

Higher\ndensities correspond to the lighter gray scale shadings.\nRS5003 KERSLEY ET AL.: RADIO TOMOGRAPHIC IMAGING OF IONOSPHERE\n6 of 9\nRS5003\nelectron densities seen in the model output, with high\nTECs on the sunlit dayside and depleted values on the\nnightside. However, an interesting detail is evidence for\nthe onset of a tongue of enhanced plasma extending\npoleward from the western Russian sector. This obser-\nvation confirms the interpretation of the increased den-\nsities seen in the tomographic image to the north of\nSvalbard as being related to plasma created by solar\nEUV radiation on the dayside that is being entrained by\nconvection into the polar cap. The GPS measurements\nsuggest that the lowest electron contents are found to the\nwest of Greenland, a result broadly confirmed by the\ndensities seen in the respective images. However, it can\nbe noted that the GPS mapping technique from observa-\ntions at a limited number of widely separate stations is\nnot able to replicate detailed structures like the blobs\nimaged in the northern sectors of the observations from\nboth the Greenland and Alaskan chains.\n[17] It is of interest to note that there was no evidence\nof a tongue of ionization in an earlier GPS map for\n0700 UT, but in subsequent hourly plots the feature can\nbe seen to advance across the polar cap, becoming\nclearly detached in the form of a patch on the dawnside\nof the magnetic pole by 1100 UT (Figure 5b). A later\ntomographic image from the European chain shows\ngreatly depleted densities to the north with no evidence\nfor intersection with a tongue of ionization, in keeping\nwith the GPS observations. By contrast, images from\nGreenland for several passes between 0900 UT and\n1100 UT all show very high densities to the north, as\ndoes one from Alaska somewhat after 1400 UT. The\nGreenland image from the pass at 1045 UT illustrates\nthis feature as a discrete structure at the northern edge,\nwith high densities and a layer peak at a high altitude,\nseparated by a depletion from the plasma building up in\nthe sunlit morning ionosphere to the south.\n4. Discussion\n[18] Radio tomographic imaging of the ionized atmo-\nsphere to date has been confined in the main to inves-\ntigations using observations made at a single chain of\nstations. The present paper represents a first attempt to\nrelate the tomographic images obtained at essentially the\nsame universal time from three station chains giving\ncoverage of a wide sector of the northern polar region.\nThe results from this first coordinated study shown\nhere demonstrate the potential of the tomographic\ntechnique to investigate large-scale structures in widely\nseparate sectors of the high-latitude ionosphere. It is\nclear that tomographic imaging opens up the possibility\nof identifying characteristic features in the plasma\ndistribution, like the depleted troughs, enhanced blobs\nand ionization tongues, of the complex structures that\nFigure 5.

Boundaries between differ-\nent plasma regimes in flux tubes linked to vastly\nseparate regions of space can be identified in tomo-\ngraphic images [e.g., Walker et al., 1998; Pryse et al.,\n1999] so that use of observations from several chains\nof stations opens up the possibility of relating bound-\naries seen in the different geomagnetic sectors at the\nsame time. A later study concerns the important topic\nof the structure of the polar ionosphere under north-\nward IMF [Middleton et al., 2005].\n[19] It has been shown that radio tomography has an\nimportant role to play in the validation of ionospheric\nmodels, not only the empirical and parameterized types\nused for the mitigation of propagation effects on practical\nradio systems [Dabas and Kersley, 2003], but also the\nfirst-principles models based on solution of the underly-\ning physical equations of the coupled ionosphere and\nthermosphere [Idenden et al., 1998]. While the earlier\nstudy was confined to comparisons with observations\nfrom a single chain of stations, the results presented here\ndemonstrate the potential of using observations from\nmultiple stations in the validation of the wider geo-\ngraphic aspects of the model behavior. At the current\nstage of development little is known about the detailed\nability of even the best available physical models\nfaithfully to replicate actual conditions. However, it is\nclear from the present work that the tomographic results\nrepresent a powerful tool in the verification of the\ndevelopment of global ionospheric models, not only\nthe physical model (CTIP) used here, but also the\nassimilative models that are currently under develop-\nment [Bust et al., 2004].\n[20] Another encouraging aspect of the current study is\nthe successful validation of the GPS mapping technique\nto give information on the basic features of the high-\nlatitude ionosphere. The method is based on the use of\nobservational data from a limited number of stations in\nthe inhospitable environment of the high Arctic. Never-\ntheless, the comparisons with the actual tomographic\nresults provide confirmatory evidence for the ability of\nthe GPS technique to replicate the large-scale structures,\nthough details are beyond the current state of develop-\nment. Such comparisons are of importance since the\nmapping of TEC from GPS observations is playing an\nincreasing role in the provision of corrections for prop-\nagation effects in radio systems applications.\n5. Conclusions\n[21] The study reported here represents the first\nattempt to try to relate radio tomographic observations\nfrom widely separate regions of the northern high-\nlatitude ionosphere. The experimental observations\nshow characteristic features that have been interpreted\nwith the aid of a coupled thermosphere ionosphere\nmodel and also linked to maps of TEC obtained from\nGPS observations. They demonstrate the potential of\nsuch wider use of tomographic imaging to understand\nthe origins and dynamics of large-scale structures in the\ncomplex polar ionosphere.\n[22] Acknowledgments.
