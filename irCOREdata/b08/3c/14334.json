The STILE Project uses hypermedia to provide greater opportunities\nfor independent and flexible modes of learning both in a campus situation and for\ndistance learning. The approach is resource-based. STILE provides a mechanism for both\ntutors and learners to discover and access relevant resources when they need them,\ntogether with facilities that enable users readily to use and re-use existing materials, to\nintegrate them together, and to add further materials of their own in a way that seems\nnatural to them (see Ruggles et al, 1995). The result is not a closed and finished product,\n40\nALT-J Volume 4 Number 2\nbut a set of tools and services and a continually developing resource base. The effect is to\nease the load on academic staff in maintaining and supporting student access to resources,\nand to enrich the set of resources available to both staff and students.\nOne such resource is an expanding database of beetles (insects of the coleopterous order).\nThis paper presents an investigation of the effectiveness of a specific use of that database,\nas a visual representation of a biological key for the identification palaeo-ecological\nfragments. We would emphasize, however, that this type of resource could be developed,\nand is being developed, across a range of subject domains.\nThe problem\nThe final year of undergraduate courses in the UK is generally one of increasing\nspecialization leading to an individual long study or dissertation. The reconstruction of\npast environments using palaeo-ecological field data is typical of such specialist studies.\nThese studies have high academic credibility but are also resource-hungry in both tutor\nand student time, and as such are increasingly threatened by the need to reduce unit costs.\nThis need for efficiency gains was the initial stimulus for the development of the beetles\ndatabase. Specifically, our task was to ease the load on academic staff by providing easy\naccess to resources for these and other students.\nAs part of our brief, we completed a task analysis from the collection of the field data to\nthe final reconstruction of the past environment. From this we noted that while some 40%\nof the students' project time was spent on the core activities such as the collecting and\npreparation of field samples, analysis and report writing, 60% was spent on identification\nof field specimens. We felt that a disproportionately large amount of time was being\nconsumed by this conceptually low-level task. It became apparent that there was scope\nnot only for efficiency gains in staff time, and therefore costs, but that it might also prove\npossible to reduce the workload of students. This in turn would lead to benefits by\nreleasing scarce laboratory time.\nThe resources\nThe task of identification is a subset of the overall skill of categorization. Categorization\nskills are the key to both the organization and retrieval of data. They allow the reduction\nof environmental data into a hierarchy of classes by discrimination, abstraction,\ngeneralization and organization of common elements or crucial aspects of stimuli. It has\nbeen argued that the organization of knowledge is the key to problem-solving and thus to\nthe individual's successful adaptation to the world. This research emphasis on knowledge\nstructures is underpinned by an extensive literature that has supported two main models\nof semantic memory: network models, based on the relationship between elements; and\nfeature models, in which memory is organized by the identification and grouping of\nfeatures (see Underwood, 1976; Solso, 1988; Anderson, 1995).\nThe two identification tools evaluated here, the paper-based key and the computer-based\nvisual key, have different organizational structures as well as different modes of\npresentation. The former is strictly hierarchical, but the latter, although having a\nhierarchical overstructure, focuses on feature identification.\n41\nJean Underwood et a\\. A STILE Project case study: the evaluation of a computer-based visual key for fossil identification\nThe paper-based key\nThere is only one current guide to British beetles (Joy, 1976), and this is the core text for\nspecimen identification using a traditional paper-based key as shown in Figure 1. It has\nan overall hierarchical structure, in that within the hierarchy information is differentiated,\nand the properties at one level apply to all related units at the next lower level. For\nexample, the description of the family Donacia supersedes and applies to the specific case\nof Donacia Cinerea. Membership of a category is not a matter of degree but is all or\nnothing.\nDONAOA\nStrongly metallic, several very variable in colour: l\u00a3J is generally\nmore narrowed behind thanlzJ; on Ike leaves and stems of water\nplants, chiefly Catex; from May to August.\n-\/-\n1 (2).

The terminology consists of a\nmixture of English and Latin names, and abbreviations are frequently employed. In\naddition, there is no use of visual information. Students at the start of their entomological\nstudies may be excused for finding this key difficult to use.\nThe computer-based visual key\nThe beetles database has a topic net structure (Ruggles et al, 1995) which allows great\nflexibility in its use and focuses on the relationships between objects. For the specific\npurpose of specimen identification, a hierarchical structure was laid over the net with a\nfocus on specific features or objects. The key starts at the level of families, and is further\nsubdivided into orders. Within each order, each insect has a file consisting of one or more\nwhole-specimen images, images of key body fragments, and information about the\ninsect's food preferences and habitat (see FitzPatrick and Greenwood, 1996).\nThe trial\nThe development of the beetles database was a response to the perceived need to reduce\ntime spent on the low-level skill of specimen identification, and to re-focus students'\nefforts on the significance of their field data. It was hypothesized that for moderately\nexperienced users, use of the visual key would lead to faster identification of specimens.

The two experienced subjects had a\nworking knowledge of paper keys and of computers. The inexperienced users had no\nknowledge of paper keys and very little experience of using this technology.\nMaterials\nAll the target specimens were elytra or wingcases - the most commonly found\nfield fragment - from members of the Chrysomelidae family. Subjects inspected the\nspecimens using a microscope with a video camera, linked to a screen. Identification was\ncompleted either using the visual key, presented on a Macintosh LCIII computer through\nthe Netscape World Wide Web browser, or using a traditional paper-based key (Joy,\n1976).\nProcedure\nBefore the trial began, each subject was introduced to the identification tools. They were\nreassured that the trial was an assessment of the tools (that is, the computer database and\npaper key), and that they should at no time feel that this was a test of their own\nperformance. Following this familiarization, the subjects were asked to identify four\nspecimens. They were allowed up to 15 minutes with each specimen. To further aid our\n43\nJean Underwood et al. A STILE Project case study: the evaluation of a computer-based visual key for fossil identification\nevaluation of the visual key, they.were asked to provide a concurrent dialogue as they\nworked through the task. Again, reassurance of the focus of the research was provided.\nA within-subject design with counterbalancing of factors was used. Each subject used the\nvisual and the paper key for the identification of two of the specimens. The order of use of\nkeys was counterbalanced, using an ABBA design, to reduce the effects of learning during\nthe trial itself. Performance measures were task time and success rates. All subjects'\ncomments were recorded. Post-trial interviews were conducted.\nResults\nSubjects attempted to complete the specimen identification in only 14 of the 16 trials. Two\nsubjects, one experienced user (D) and one novice user (A), each identified one of the\nspecimens correctly, and the second experienced user (C) produced a close match judged\nby our expert to be an acceptable answer; that is, user C had successfully negotiated the\nhigher levels of the identification hierarchy, but had failed to distinguish between closely\nrelated samples. In all three of these cases the subjects were using the visual computer-\nbased key. The second inexperienced user (B) failed to identify any of the specimens.\nThe use of the visual key was not without problems, however. Students seemed very\ndisturbed by what they saw as disparities in the colour match between specimens and the\nimages in the key. Secondly, two of the four students had navigational problems in\nrecovering from an abortive trail.\nNo acceptable answers were recorded for subjects using the paper-based key. This was\nsurprising, as Subject C was an experienced user of this tool although he had not worked\nwith the Danacia family. One subject refused to complete the identification process when\nusing the paper-based key. The following statements are typical of users' comments of the\npaper-based key:\nI reckon it's virtually impossible to tell from the key really. (Subject D) \u2022\n\/ think I'm going to find this impossible. (Subject A)\nYeah, I'm going to have to give up again. I couldn't do it. (Subject B)\nThere was no discernible difference in the overall mean time on task between trials using\nthe computer key (mean of 390.6 seconds) and the paper key (mean of 382.5 seconds).The\nshortest time was recorded for a non-computer trial when the subject had actively\ncurtailed the trial (Table 1).\nThere was an interaction between type of tool used and level of experience, however.\nFigure 3 shows that the more experienced users spent longer with the paper-based key\nthan the inexperienced users but that the position was reversed for the visual key. This\nsmall pilot study suggests that whereas the visual-based key enables the student to take\npart in the identification process, the paper-based key acts as a barrier. This barrier can\nbe so great that the student effectively gives up. More experienced subjects were able to\ncome to a conclusion more rapidly using the visual key with a success rate of 50% (two\nout of the four specimens). They were more willing to persevere with the paper-based key\nthan the inexperienced users, and struggled to complete the task, hence the increase in\n44\nVolume 4 Number 2\nVisual\nKey\nPapa-\nKey\nInexperienced\nSubject\nA\n586*\n500\n265\n490\nSubject\nB\n496\n284\n257 \u2022\n327*\nExperienced\nSubject\nc@\n540\n254**\n554\n505\nSubject\nD\n243*\n222\n459\n203\nTable I: Time taken to complete an identification using the two keys by the four subjects.\nKey\n* Correct identification\n** Close identification\n\u2022 Curtailed task\n@ This subject has mild colour-blindness, but the problem was not identified until the end of the\nproject.\n600 -\n4S0 -\n400 -\nn\n\"g 390 -\ne\na> 300 -\nSreconds\n5 250 -\no>\nE 200 -\n150 -\n100 -\nSO -\n0 -_\u2022\u2022___\nlne>perienced\nU\u00aben\u00ab\n\u2022\nExper'enced\nU\u00aber\u00bb\n\u2022 Visual Key\nD Paper Key\n\u20141\nSubjects\nFigure 3: Mean time taken to complete an identification using the two keys by level of experience.\n45\nJean Underwood et al.

This perseverance was not met by success,\nhowever. Even the small shift from one family of beetles to another made the use of the\npaper key extremely difficult for Subject C.\nPost-trial interviews confirmed that the visual database was both the preferred and the\nmore effective way of operating for all students. Subject A, inexperienced but with one\nsuccessful identification using the visual key, admitted that she struggled with the paper-\nbased key but found the visual key easy to use. She was most impressed by the low level\nof computer skills required to operate the software effectively. Subject B, also\ninexperienced, had found the paper-based key impossible but appreciated the facility to\nquickly browse through the visual key. Subject C, experienced, felt the visual key was\npotentially very useful and very easy to use but he had some problems because of his mild\ncolour-blindness. Subject D, experienced, was convinced that the visual key would save\nhim time.\nConclusion\nWhile the small sample size for this pilot study necessarily means that the results should\nbe viewed with caution, they are nevertheless encouraging. Our initial hypotheses were\nthat moderately experienced users would identify the specimens more quickly using the\nvisual key but at first sight the data does not support our hypothesis. Mean times for the\nuse of the two keys are indistinguishable. This result can be explained, however, by the\ntendency of one inexperienced student to curtail sessions when working with the paper\nkey and by other students' willingness to continue using the computer key after a\npreliminary identification had been made (Subjects A and C) to confirm a decision. Long\nsearch times with the paper-based key did not lead to success, and the shorter times were\nassociated with a refusal to continue the trial. The efficiency gains that were apparent\nderive from the differential success rate for students when using the visual key compared\nto the paper key\nIn addition, it was hypothesized that the use of the visual key would reduce the level of\nskills required by the novice or inexperienced researcher when first encountering the\nidentification task. This was certainly confirmed. This initial simple measure of\nperformance - correct identification - showed one novice user performing at a similar\nlevel to more experienced counterparts, and the second novice at least completing the\ntask.\nReferences\nAnderson, J.R.
