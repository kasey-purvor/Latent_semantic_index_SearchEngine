WHY TRADE OPENNESS MIGHT PROMOTE MULTILATERAL \nENVIRONMENTAL COOPERATION \nThis article examines whether trade openness promotes multilateral environmental \ncooperation. The reader might wonder what one has to do with the other, but the \nliberal, functionalist and neo-functionalist schools of international relations (IR) \nhave long since argued that openness to trade might foster cooperation and \ndisperse confrontation in other policy areas. Most prominently, the suggestion that \ntrading states might be less prone to go to war against each other dates back to at \nleast Em\u00e9ric Cruc\u00e9 (1623 [1909]). Many of the classical liberal economists in the \nwake of Adam Smith (1776 [1979]) shared the same belief, most notably John \nStuart Mill who saw \u2018the great extent and rapid increase of international trade\u2019 as \nthe \u2018principal guarantee of the peace of the world\u2019 (Mill, 1852 [1965], p. 594). \nThe case for a \u201cliberal peace\u201d,2 as comprehensively put forward in Rosecrance \n(1986), rests on both substantive self-interest as well as more idealistic grounds. \nAs concerns the substantive self-interest, the major argument is that states with \nsubstantial mutual trading links have more to lose in terms of welfare if these links \nbecome interrupted by violent conflict. Also, the exploitation of trading \nopportunities can serve as a substitute and alternative for acquiring natural \nresources and markets by force. The more idealistic grounds suggest that \ninternational trade might foster a spirit of community and cooperation. Against \nthis, proponents of the realistic school of IR have long since argued that trade is \nirrelevant as traditional political and military considerations dominate the decision \nto enter into violent conflict. The empirical evidence is somewhat indeterminate, \n4 \nwith the majority of studies supporting the idea of a liberal peace (see, for \nexample, Oneal et al., 1996; Hegre, 2000; for conflicting evidence see, for \nexample, Barbieri, 1996; Beck, Katz and Trucker, 1998). \nA combination of self-interest and idealistic grounds could also suggest a case \nfor trade openness promoting multilateral environmental cooperation. To start \nwith, countries open to trade have a reputation to defend. In a world where \nimports of foreign goods are still regarded as mainly benefiting the exporter, \nexporting countries are always at the risk of being blamed for exploiting their \ngood economic fortunes. To participate, and possibly to lead, in multilateral \ncooperation, environmental or not, can provide a mechanism to disperse these \nconcerns to some extent. This incentive will be the stronger the more a country is \na net exporter of goods and services. It will also be particularly strong in the \nenvironmental field if the country is engaging in economic activity that contributes \nto trans-boundary and possibly global negative environmental externalities.3 It will \nbe strongest if these economic activities are connected to the goods and services \nexported by a country. \nConnected to the last point, if countries more open to trade have a more \nsubstantial interest in future trade agreements in order to expand trading \nopportunities, then their participation in multilateral cooperation, environmental \n                                                                                                                                     \n2\n Thus called in tradition of the \u201cdemocratic peace\u201d, which suggests that democracies rarely fight \nagainst each other. \n3\n Note that the negative externality need not accrue in a physical form, but can be psychological as \nwell. For example, cruel treatment to animals within the national boundaries of one country can \nhave spill-over effects as individuals in other countries suffer from knowing about this cruel \ntreatment. \n5 \nor not, might serve as a signalling device. The signal sent out to other countries is \nthat the country wants to be seen as serious about multilateral cooperation in \ngeneral and therefore fit for multilateral cooperation concerning trade agreements \nin particular (Fredriksson and Gaston, 1999, 2000). Hoel and Schneider (1997, p. \n155) go as far as arguing that a country might become excluded from a future \ntrade agreement if it refuses to participate in multilateral environmental \ncooperation efforts. While there is little evidence that a country might become \nexcluded from a trade agreement merely because of its refusal to participate in \nmultilateral environmental cooperation, countries are in a constant process of \n\u201cgive\u201d and \u201ctake\u201d in multilateral negotiations where willingness to cooperate in \nthe environmental arena might be necessary to achieve the country\u2019s objective in \nanother policy field. A country that has not much to gain from multilateral \nenvironmental cooperation might still participate in order to reap the benefits of \ncooperation in other areas, particularly trade, where it has more to gain. \nEnvironmental concessions might therefore be the quid pro quo necessary to strike \na deal in other areas of multilateral cooperation. \nAs another reason grounded in self interest consider the fact that often \nmultilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) contain trade restrictive measures. \nIn as much as countries more open to trade are bound to be more affected by these \nrestrictive measures than more closed countries, they have an incentive to \nparticipate in these MEAs in order to have a voice in the negotiations and \ninfluence the result according to their interest. To abstain carries the risk of being \nconfronted with a fait accompli that might very well damage the trading interest of \nthe abstaining country. \n6 \nSelf-interest can potentially deter countries open to trade from participating in \nMEAs as well, however. Participation in MEAs usually implies incurring real \neconomic costs to achieve the environmental objectives. Countries open to trade \nmight be particularly concerned about losses to their economy\u2019s \u201ccompetitiveness\u201d \nif they were to incur these costs (Stewart, 1993; Esty and Geradin, 1997). In \nparticular, if a MEA is likely to contain trade restrictive measures that would \nconsiderably damage the economic prospects of a country, then specific export \ninterests might deter rather than promote multilateral environmental cooperation. \nIf a country perceives that in spite of participation it cannot exert enough influence \nto alter the trade and other restrictions contained in a MEA sufficiently towards its \nown interests, then this country might find it more attractive to stay outside the \nMEA. In particular, big and important countries might stand a chance to endanger \nthe whole process of multilateral environmental cooperation if they perceive that \nthe benefits are not worth the costs they incur and therefore boycott the MEA. \nWitness the United States opposition to the Kyoto Protocol, which puts the treaty \nitself in danger. \nAs concerns more idealistic grounds, the major argument is that people living \nin countries open to trade are not only exposed to foreign goods and services, but \nalso to new ideas and information about the environmental and other conditions \noutside their own countries. Trade openness might thus foster an appreciation of \nthe problems generated by trans-boundary and global negative environmental \nexternalities, which might put pressure on a country\u2019s policy makers to participate \nin multilateral efforts to solve these problems. This incentive is likely to be \nstronger if a country actually imports significant amounts of goods and services \nand not just merely exports them. \n7 \nTrade liberalisation and environmental protection are often, rightly or wrongly, \nclaimed to be conflicting objectives. It would be beyond the scope of this paper to \nanalyse and evaluate these claims (see Neumayer, 2001). What is important here is \nthat since countries are bound to become increasingly open towards trade, \nenvironmentally grounded resistance to this trend is likely to become stronger. If, \nhowever, trade openness promoted multilateral environmental cooperation, then \none important argument could be made in favour of a synergy, rather than conflict, \nbetween trade liberalisation and environmental protection.  \n \n2. RESEARCH DESIGN \na. Methodology \nThere are basically two methods available for analysing systematically whether \ntrade openness promotes multilateral environmental cooperation. One is to \nexamine whether countries open to trade are more likely to sign or ratify MEAs \nthan closed countries. The dependent variable is therefore a dichotomous one: the \ncountry either signs\/ratifies or not. The appropriate estimation technique for this \nmethod is probit or logit. The second method is to examine whether countries \nopen to trade are more likely to ratify MEAs or otherwise become a party to the \nMEA earlier than closed countries. The dependent variable is therefore a \ncontinuous time variable. One possible estimation technique for this method is the \nCox proportional hazards model, also known as a survival model. It assumes that \nthere is a time-variant underlying base hazard of ratification at any point of time \nthat depends on unobserved variables. Observed control variables increase or \nlower this base hazard by a constant proportional amount. \n8 \nBoth methods have their respective advantages and disadvantages. The first \nmethod is conceptually clear: a country failing to sign or ratify a MEA clearly fails \nto cooperate. Also, probit and logit are widely used estimation techniques. Its \nmajor disadvantage is that it cannot deal with MEAs that have a quasi-universal \nmembership since the lack of variation would inhibit statistical testing. It might \nactually be advantageous to be forced to look at MEAs open to all, but without \nvirtually global membership, however. This is because it is exactly these MEAs \nwhere environmental commitment is needed on behalf of countries to join. Global \nmembership MEAs, on the other hand, are often agreements that can be joined \nwithout commitment to incurring any costs. It is doubtful whether they represent \nmuch gain in relation to the non-cooperative outcome. \nThe second method is conceptually less clear. Fredriksson and Gaston (1999, \n2000) argue that early ratification can function as a proxy for a country\u2019s intensity \nof preference for multilateral environmental cooperation. They regard ratification \ndelay as a clear sign for lack of commitment: \n \nThose countries that delay their ratification of treaty do so, either \nbecause they perceive the treaty provisions as too costly and severe, \nor lacking net benefits (or that it may be strategically worthwhile to \n\u201chold-out\u201d, in which case they risk non-implementation of the \nagreement). (Fredriksson and Gaston, 2000, p. 347). \n \nIn support of their argument they refer to Sand who argues that \n \n9 \n...possibly the most serious drawback of the treaty method [for \ndealing with multilateral environmental problems, E.N.] is the time \nlag between the drafting, adoption and entry into force of standards. \nSand (1991, p. 250). \n \nHowever, while early ratification might show commitment to the \nenvironmental cause of the MEA, a delay in ratification can be caused by many \nfactors other than lack of commitment. For example, some countries might find it \ndifficult to achieve early ratification due to the peculiarities of their political \nsystem. Also, in the case of the Kyoto Protocol, for example, ratification by \nalmost all countries with binding emission restrictions is delayed due to conflict \nabout the specifics of some of the provisions contained in the Protocol. \nThe second method\u2019s great advantage is that it allows for greater variation \namong countries since the dependent variable is not simply a dichotomous one. \nConnected to this point, it can examine MEAs with quasi-universal membership \nsince countries will still differ with respect to the time of their ratification. This \nmethod\u2019s disadvantages are that the estimation technique used is far less familiar \nto readers. More importantly, this method cannot deal with very recent MEAs that \nhave not been ratified by many countries yet since MEAs are usually signed at the \nsame time by most prospective parties. For these cases only the first method is \nsuitable. There is a disadvantage connected to analysing signature rather than \nratification, however. This is because a country is not bound to a treaty unless it \nhas ratified it. Signature is not a formal commitment. A good example for this is \nthe de facto withdrawal of the United States from the Kyoto Protocol, which is of \ncourse easily possible since the country has not yet ratified the treaty. \n10 \n \nb. The dependent variables \nIn this paper we will use both methods. We use the first method for three MEAs \nthat do not have quasi-universal membership and are too recent to having been \nratified by many countries: \n \n\u2022 the Kyoto Protocol (84 signatures as of 26 October 2001; www.unfccc.org). It \nis a protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change \n(FCCC). It sets up restrictions for so-called Annex 1 countries (OECD-\ncountries plus the economies in transition in Eastern Europe including the \nRussian Federation) on their emission of greenhouse gases. In its current form \nit does not contain any substantive trade restrictive measures, but it is expected \nto do so in the future (Neumayer, 2001). \n\u2022 the Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain \nHazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade (Rotterdam \nConvention) (73 signatures as of 1 September 2001; www.chem.unep.ch). It is \na MEA in pursuance of chapter 19 of the Agenda 21 on \u2018Environmentally \nsound management of toxic chemicals, including prevention of illegal \ninternational traffic in toxic and dangerous products\u2019. Its objective is \u2018to \npromote shared responsibility and cooperative efforts among Parties in the \ninternational trade of certain hazardous chemicals in order to protect human \nhealth and the environment from potential harm and to contribute to their \nenvironmentally sound use\u2019 (Art. 1). Annex III of the Convention specifies the \nchemicals which are subject to the Prior Informed Consent (PIC) procedure \n(initially, Annex III encompasses 30 chemicals). This means, that a country \n11 \nmay only export one of these chemicals to another country if it has sought and \nreceived the PIC of the importing country. Furthermore, the exporting country \nhas the duty to provide for \u2018labelling requirements that ensure adequate \navailability of information with regard to risks and\/or hazards to human health \nor the environment, taking into account relevant international standards\u2019 (Art. \n13:2). This applies to all chemicals listed in Annex III, all chemicals banned or \nseverely restricted in the exporting country\u2019s territory (Art. 13:2) as well as to \nall chemicals subject to environmental or health labelling requirements (Art. \n13:3). Exports of chemicals, the use of which is banned or severely restricted \nin the exporting country\u2019s territory, are subject to laborious information \nrequirements for export notification as laid down in Annex V of the \nConvention. \n\u2022 the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity \n(103 signatures as of 12 September 2001; www.biodiv.org). This Biosafety \nProtocol controls the use of living modified organisms, better known as \ngenetically modified organisms (GMOs), which pose a threat to biodiversity as \nthey represent an exogenously introduced disturbance of existing ecosystems \nand, in some cases at least, can mutate, migrate and procreate. It is a Protocol \nof the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). Art. 19:3 of the CBD calls \nupon parties to consider \u2018the need for and modalities of a protocol setting out \nappropriate procedures, including, in particular, advance informed agreement, \nin the field of the safe transfer, handling and use of any living modified \norganism resulting from biotechnology that may have adverse effect on the \nconservation and sustainable use of biological diversity\u2019. The Biosafety \nProtocol does just that. The single most important trade restrictive element of \n12 \nthe Protocol is an advance informed agreement procedure similar to the prior \ninformed consent mechanism of the Rotterdam Convention. The country of \npotential import can put conditions on the import or even ban the import. \nHowever, many types of GMOs are not subject to this procedure. \n \nWe use the second method for another three MEAs that have quasi-universal \nmembership:4 \n \n\u2022 the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna \nand Flora (CITES) (155 parties as of 14 November 2001; www.cites.org). It \nrestricts the trade in endangered species listed in its appendix I and II. \nAppendix I contains species (around 600 animals and 300 plant species), \nwhich are threatened with extinction and whose trade for commercial purposes \nis generally prohibited with few exceptions (Article III). Appendix II contains \na further 4000 animals and 25,000 plants species, which might become \nthreatened with extinction if their trade was not regulated. Their export is only \nallowed if the exporter has acquired an export permit from the state of export, \ntestifying that the export will not be detrimental to the survival of that species, \nthat the specimen were not obtained in contravention of protection laws of the \nexporting state and that any living specimen will be so prepared for transport \nthat risk of injury, damage to health or cruel treatment is minimised (Art. IV). \n\u2022 the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (180 \nparties as of 29 August 2001; www.unep.ch\/ozone). The aim of the Montreal \n13 \nProtocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer is to phase out ozone \ndepleting substances (ODS): substances responsible for the thinning of the \nozone layer in the stratosphere, which filters out ultraviolet radiation. The \nProtocol\u2019s major trade provisions are contained in its Art. 4. It bans imports \n(Art. 4.1) and exports (Art. 4.2) of controlled substances between parties and \nnon-parties of the Protocol, unless non-parties can demonstrate that in spite of \nnot being formally a party to the Protocol they nevertheless comply with its \nobligations (Art. 4.8). Art. 4.3 also bans the import of products containing \ncontrolled substances from non-parties. \n\u2022 the Convention on Biological Diversity (182 parties as of 12 September 2001; \nwww.biodiv.org). The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), which was \none of the few tangible results of the United Nations Conference on Trade and \nthe Environment (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, has as its objectives \n\u2018the conservation of biological diversity, the sustainable use of its components \nand the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the utilization \nof genetic resources\u2019 (Art. 1). It does not explicitly provide for trade measures. \n \nData on the status of signature and the date of ratification, acceptance, \napproval or accession are from the homepages of the respective MEAs.5 Together \nthese six MEAs cover a broad range of environmental concern: from climate \n                                                                                                                                     \n4\n We do not look at ratification of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change \n(FCCC), which has been analysed by Fredriksson and Gaston (1999, 2000). \n5\n Note that none of the results reported further below changes substantially if all ratifications, \nacceptances, approvals and accessions before the agreed conditional date of entry into force are \ntreated as equivalent. \n14 \nchange, ozone layer depletion, trade in hazardous chemicals and pesticides to \ngenetically modified organisms, biodiversity and wildlife conservation. Because \nratification is open to all countries at the same time, in principle left censoring is \nnot a problem. However, some countries gained their independence only after the \nMEA was opened for ratification. In these cases, ratification delay was counted \nfrom the date of their independence, which was established with the help of CIA \n(2000). Belarus and the Ukraine are exceptions to this rule. They had a seat in the \nUnited Nations and the right to sign and ratify international agreements before \ntheir independence from the former Soviet Union. \n \nc. The independent variables \nThere is no uniformly agreed measure of trade openness, our main independent \nvariable of interest. We will use a range of proxy variables here. The first one is a \nsimple dichotomous variable, which is set to 1 if a country is a member of the \nWorld Trade Organization (WTO), and 0 otherwise (information taken from \nwww.wto.org). The idea is that WTO members have revealed a commitment to \ntrade openness in participating in a multilateral regime whose objective is the \nliberalisation and expansion of trade. \nThe next two proxies are commonly used rather simple measures: one is the \nnatural log of the sum of exports and imports divided by gross domestic product \n(GDP). The other consists of the natural log of exports divided by GDP as well as, \nseparately, the natural log of imports divided by GDP.6 Since the amount of goods \nand services traded can change quite a bit from year to year, the simple average of \n15 \nthe relevant data over the period 1994 to 1998 was taken (data from World Bank, \n2000). The other proxies are more complex. The fourth variable is an index of \ntrade openness published by the Fraser Institute (2000), as part of their 1997 \nEconomic Freedom of the World index. It is a composite measure of taxes levied \non international trade as percent of exports plus imports, the difference between \nthe official exchange rate and the black market rate, the actual size of the trade \nsector compared to the expected size as well as restrictions on the freedom of \ncitizens to engage in capital transactions with foreigners. It ranges from 0 (least \ntrade open) to 10 (most trade open). The last proxy variable is an index of trade \nopenness published by the Heritage Foundation (2001). Similar to the Fraser \nInstitute index, it is part of their 2001 Index of Economic Freedom. It is a \ncomposite measure of a country\u2019s average tariff rate, existing non-tariff barriers \nand perceived corruption in a country\u2019s customs services. This index ranges from \n1 (most trade open) to 5 (least trade open). In order to facilitate understanding it \nhas been reversed for the estimations reported further below, such that 1 means \nleast and 5 means most trade open. \nIn addition to these general trade openness variables, we also include a number \nof specific export interest variables for five out of the six MEAs looked at. For the \nKyoto Protocol, a dummy is used for countries that export fossil fuels (data taken \nfrom World Bank, 2001). For the Biosafety Protocol, a dummy is used for \ncountries with plantations of genetically modified crops in excess of 100,000 \nhectares (data taken from James, 2000). For the Rotterdam Convention a logged \nvariable measuring the share of the value of chemical to all exports is used. \n                                                                                                                                     \n6\n We log some variables if their distribution is skewed in order to reduce potential problems with \n16 \nChemical exports are taken from UNCTAD (2000), general export data from \nWorld Bank (2000). For the Montreal Protocol, a variable measures the log of net \nexports (production minus consumption) of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in tons of \nozone depleting potential averaged over the period 1986 to 1989, with data \ncompiled from UNEP (1999). For the Convention on International Trade in \nEndangered Species a variable is used that measures the ratio of threatened species \nto all species, with data compiled from WCMC (1994). No trade related specific \nvariable could be found for the Convention on Biological Diversity, which \ncontains only few directly trade relevant provisions. However, we included as a \ngeneral interest variable the logged total number of species estimated to be located \nwithin a country, with data compiled from WCMC (1994). \nApart from the variables for trade openness, three other general control \nvariables are used throughout. In addition to theoretical justification they have also \nproven to be significant factors explaining environmental commitment in \nNeumayer (2002). The first is per capita income, which is expected to have a \npositive effect on a country\u2019s willingness to participate in multilateral \nenvironmental cooperation efforts. In economic terms this would mean that this \nwillingness is a luxury good with an income elasticity greater than one. Note that \nthis need not imply that poor countries care less about trans-boundary and global \nenvironmental problems per se. Rather, because of their poverty they might \nprioritise issues other than these. Income per capita is measured as GDP per capita \nin purchasing power parity (PPP) in US$ in 1998, taken from UNDP (2000). \nSecond, big and \u201cimportant\u201d countries should be more environmentally committed \n                                                                                                                                     \nheteroscedasticity. \n17 \nthan small and \u201cunimportant\u201d ones. As a proxy for this variable one could either \ntake a country\u2019s total income or population since both economic power and \npopulation size should be positively correlated with \u201cimportance\u201d. The natural log \nof total population size is used as a proxy for a country\u2019s importance here (data \ntaken from World Bank, 2000).7 Note that more important countries might show \nsigns of stronger willingness to participate in multilateral environmental \ncooperation efforts not necessarily due to stronger environmental concern per se. \nRather, we hypothesise here that these countries will find it in their interest to \ndemonstrate stronger willingness to participate in these cooperation efforts in \norder to demonstrate their importance in world politics, of which environment \nrepresents one part. In other words, important countries want to be seen as good \ncitizens and leaders in world environmental affairs. Another incentive for these \ncountries to participate in multilateral cooperation might be that it allows them to \ninternalise part of the benefits generated by cooperation. The third and final \ncontrol variable is a measure for \u201cdemocracy\u201d taken from Freedom House (2000), \nbased on 1998 data. Their measure is derived from expert assessments of the \nextent to which a country effectively provides for political rights and civil \nliberties, both measured on a 1 to 7 scale (Karatnycky, 1999, pp. 546-553). \nPolitical rights refer to, for example, the existence and fairness of elections, \nexistence of opposition and the possibility to take over power via elections. Civil \nliberties refer to, for example, the freedom of assembly, the right to open and free \ndiscussion, the independence of media, protection from political terror and the \nprevalence of the rule of law. For the estimations used below the two indices have \n                                                 \n7\n The reader should note that total income and population cannot be used simultaneously as this \n18 \nbeen added and reversed in sign, such that 2 means lowest and 14 means highest \nmeasure of \u201cdemocracy\u201d. \n \n3. RESULTS \nTable 1 reports the probit estimation results for the Kyoto Protocol, the Biosafety \nProtocol and the Rotterdam Convention.8 Note that the reported coefficients are \nalready changes in the probability for a one unit increase of a variable at the mean \nof all variables, not the non-transformed probit coefficients.9 There are five \ndifferent estimations for each MEA depending on which of our proxy for trade \nopenness enters the estimated equation in addition to the three control variables \nincluded throughout. A more detailed discussion and interpretation of the \nestimated coefficients for the trade variables is presented in the next section. \nStarting with the Kyoto Protocol, all our non-trade related control variables are \nstatistically significant in all estimations: Richer, more democratic and more \npopulous countries are more likely to have signed the Kyoto Protocol. As \nconcerns our proxy variables for general trade openness, only the Fraser Institute \nindex shows some statistical significance. Fuel exporters are less likely to have \nsigned the Protocol and significantly so in four out of the five cases. \n \n< INSERT TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE > \n                                                                                                                                     \nwould lead to perfect multicollinearity given that per capita income is another explanatory variable. \n8\n Alternatively, logit estimates could have been undertaken. The two techniques generally provide \nvery similar results (Verbeek, 2000). \n9\n For a dummy variable, it represents the change in probability due to a change in the dummy from \n0 to 1. \n19 \n \nTurning to the Biosafety Protocol it can be seen that almost without exception \ndemocracy and the population size of a country have a positive impact upon the \npredicted probability of having signed this Protocol. The income variable, on the \nother hand, is insignificant throughout. The explanation for this is that Biosafety is \nof substantial environmental concern to developing countries as well and there are \nvery limited costs in their participation. WTO membership and the Fraser Institute \nindex are the only statistically significant proxy variables for general trade \nopenness, both with a positive sign. Countries with substantial production of \ngenetically modified crops are statistically significantly less likely to have signed \nthe Protocol in four out of the five models tested. Note, however, that this variable \nneeds to be treated with care. There are only six countries with substantial \nproduction, namely, the United States, Argentina, Canada and \u2013 albeit on a much \nsmaller scale \u2013 China, South Africa and Australia. Due to the little variation in \nthis dummy variable, the estimated coefficient is highly sensitive to any single one \nof these country\u2019s decision to sign or not. Argentina, Canada and China have \nsigned the Protocol, Australia, South Africa and the United States have not. \nAs concerns the Rotterdam Convention, neither income nor population size is \nconsistently estimated as having a positive significant effect on signature. WTO \nmembership again assumes statistical significance. As before, trade openness as \nmeasured by the sum of exports and imports per GDP is insignificant, but note \nthat in the case of the Rotterdam Convention this is triggered by the opposing \neffects export and import openness have: countries with a high exports to GDP \nratio are statistically significantly more likely, countries with a high imports to \nGDP ratio are less likely to have signed the Convention. A greater share of \n20 \nchemical among all exports does not have a statistically significant influence \nthroughout. \nTurning to the remaining three MEAs for which the second method was used, \nTable 2 reports estimated results from a Cox proportional hazards model for the \nMontreal Protocol, the Biodiversity Convention and CITES. Note that the reported \ncoefficients are hazard ratios. A coefficient greater than one means that the \ncorresponding variable has a positive impact upon the speed of ratification and a \nnegative impact for a coefficient smaller than one. Starting with the Montreal \nProtocol, both income and population size speed up ratification. The clear \nsignificance of the income variable was to be expected as ozone layer depletion \nwas strongly considered to be a \u201crich man\u2019s concern\u201d at the time. Note that the \nonly proxy for general trade openness statistically significant are the sum of \nexports and imports per GDP as well as exports per GDP, separately. Also, higher \nexports of CFCs result in a more rapid ratification of the Montreal Protocol. \n \n< INSERT TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE > \n \nIn case of the CBD, all non-trade related control variables are significant \nthroughout. Note that the income variable is smaller than one throughout and \nsignificantly so in all but one case. This is triggered by the fact that the CBD with \nits promise of a \u2018fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the \nutilization of genetic resources\u2019 (Art. 1) soon became an MEA favoured by \ndeveloping countries. As concerns the general trade openness variables, WTO \nmembership, export openness and the Fraser Institute index are estimated to have \na positive significant effect on ratification speed. Import openness has the opposite \n21 \neffect. Greater biodiversity results in ratification delay. This can be explained with \nthe fact that biodiversity-rich countries were for a long time sceptical about the \nCBD as they feared it would encroach into what they perceived as their sovereign \nright over the genetic resources within their territory. \nFor CITES, democracy and population size have a positive impact upon \nratification speed, whereas income has a significantly negative impact in two \nestimations. WTO membership, the Fraser Institute index as well as exports per \nGDP exert a statistically significantly positive impact upon ratification speed. \nNote that, again, imports per GDP are statistically significant with the opposite \nsign.10 A higher ratio of threatened to all species on a country\u2019s territory speeds up \nratification. \n \n4. DISCUSSION OF THE EFFECT OF TRADE OPENNESS \nThe results reported above provide some evidence for trade openness promoting \nmultilateral environmental cooperation. None of the proxies for trade openness \nconsistently appears to be a statistically significant explanatory factor. \nNonetheless, it is interesting to note that WTO membership assumes statistical \nsignificance for four out of the six MEAs under investigation. Note that causality \nis not necessarily claimed here. But it suggests that being accustomed to cooperate \nin multilateral trade affairs goes, to some extent at least, hand in hand with \ncountries\u2019 willingness to cooperate in multilateral environmental affairs as well. \nThis is a good message because a WTO dispute over some trade restrictive \n                                                 \n10\n The latter result mirrors a finding by Fredriksson and Gaston (1999), where export openness \nproved to have a positive and import openness a negative effect on ratification speed for the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC). \n22 \nmeasure contained in a MEA is most likely to break out between two WTO \nmembers, where one is and the other is not a party to the MEA (Neumayer 2000). \nHence, if WTO membership tends to promote a country\u2019s willingness to cooperate \nin multilateral environmental affairs, there is less danger of such a dispute. \nHow strong is the effect? After controlling for other variables, WTO members \nare estimated to have a 30 per cent higher likelihood to have signed the Biosafety \nProtocol and a 26 per cent higher likelihood to have signed the Rotterdam \nConvention than non-members, which is certainly not negligible. Interpretation of \nthe relevant coefficient in the case of the Convention on Biological Diversity and \nthe CITES is not quite as straightforward. Note that the coefficients signify the \nhazard ratio of becoming a party to the MEA at any point of time associated with a \none-unit change in the variable or a change from 0 to 1 for a dummy variable, \nconditional on all other variables remaining constant and given a certain \nunderlying time-dependent baseline hazard that represents exogenous unobserved \nvariables. The effect of WTO membership is estimated to increase this hazard by \nabout 64 per cent for the Convention on Biological Diversity and by about 95 per \ncent for the CITES. \nGeneral export openness also assumes statistical significance in four out of the \nsix cases. It is striking that export openness assumes statistical significance in all \nthree MEAs that contain quite elaborate trade restrictive measures (Rotterdam \nConvention, Montreal Protocol and CITES). One could interpret this as evidence \nin favour of the theoretical proposition that countries with a large export sector \nwant to be seen as taking on responsibility in multilateral environmental affairs \nand want to have a voice and vote in negotiations of MEAs that contain trade \nrestrictive measures that potentially affect their trading interests. \n23 \nGeneral import openness, contrary to general export openness, is irrelevant in \nmost cases and has a negative impact on multilateral environmental cooperation in \ntwo cases. One plausible explanation for this is that these countries do not have as \nmuch interest in multilateral environmental cooperation because they are less \nvulnerable to critique if they fail to cooperate and are less vulnerable to any \npotential trade restrictive measures as well, which usually tend to affect exports \nstronger than imports. As an example, consider the Montreal Protocol, which went \nas far as threatening to ban or restrict imports from non-parties of goods made \nwith, but not containing, controlled substances (Article 4.4), which poses a \nsignificant and clear threat to exporting countries. The finding also invalidates the \ntheoretical suggestion that import openness promotes multilateral environmental \ncooperation via an influx of ideas and an appreciation of environmental problems \nbeyond the nation\u2019s borders. \nHow strong is the effect of general export and import openness? A one point \nincrease at the mean of the logged export to GDP ratio variable, ln(EXP), leads to \n31 per cent greater likelihood of having signed the Rotterdam Convention. The \nsame increase in the logged imports to GDP ratio, ln(IMP), leads to 44 per cent \nless likelihood of having signed the Convention, which is certainly not negligible \neven if one considers that the standard deviations are 0.66 for ln(EXP) and 0.57 \nfor ln(IMP), respectively. A one-unit increase in ln(EXP) raises the hazard by 40 \nper cent in the case of the Montreal Protocol, by 61 per cent in the case of the \nConvention on Biological Diversity and by 113 per cent in the case of CITES. \nAs concerns the composite measures of trade openness, the Heritage \nFoundation index tests insignificant throughout. The Fraser Institute index \nassumes statistical significance in the case of four MEAs. However, one cannot be \n24 \nsure whether the significance is not spurious. This is because of the high \ncollinearity of this measure of trade openness with the income and democracy \ncontrol variables (partial Pearson correlation coefficients greater than 0.6). High \ncorrelation with the control variables is much less a problem for the other proxies \nof general trade openness, which suggests that one can be more confident that they \ndo not merely artificially assume some explanatory power that rightly belongs to \none of the other control variables. \nContrary to general export openness, specific export interests do not play a \nconsistent role. Fossil fuel exporters are less likely to have signed the Kyoto \nProtocol. The same is true for countries growing crops that are genetically \nmodified in the case of the Biosafety Protocol. For the Rotterdam Convention a \nhigher ratio of chemicals exports to all exports does not have a statistically \nsignificant effect on countries\u2019 willingness to cooperate. On the other hand, for the \nMontreal Protocol countries with greater exports of CFCs are estimated to have \nratified the Protocol earlier on. The same is true for countries with a higher ratio \nof threatened to total species for CITES. The explanation for these differences \nprobably lies in the nature of the MEAs. Fossil fuel exporters have much to lose \nfrom a MEA such as the Kyoto Protocol that tries to curb greenhouse gas \nemissions, which mainly stem from fossil fuel consumption. Countries growing \ncrops that are genetically modified might resist a treaty that regulates and in many \ninstances restricts trade in these crops.11 For the Rotterdam Convention, it is \nunclear whether chemical exporters have more to gain from participating and \ninfluencing the treaty process or abstaining, which is reflected in the \n25 \ninsignificance of the chemical exports variable. For CITES, countries with a high \nratio of threatened species to total species were presumably better off cooperating \nand influencing the decision making process than facing potential trade boycotts \nby Western countries outside their control. As concerns the Montreal Protocol, \nMurdoch and Sandler (1994) argue that the major producers (and therefore \nexporters) had enough incentives to reduce their emissions out of their own self-\ninterest. The Montreal Protocol might merely have codified the non-cooperative \nNash strategies of the major players who would have undertaken the emission \nreductions in any case. Given that the same industries that produced CFCs before \nwere also the prime candidates for producing substitutes, the major exporters had \na strong incentive to bring the Montreal Protocol into force early on. \n \n5. CONCLUSION \nAll in all, similar to Fredriksson and Gaston (1999, 2000), but based on a much \nwider sample of MEAs and a broader set of proxies for trade openness, this article \nfinds some evidence that general trade openness promotes multilateral \nenvironmental cooperation. As countries are likely to become more and more open \nto trade this could have a positive effect on multilateral environmental \ncooperation. However, one cannot rely on increased trade openness having a \nstrong positive effect on multilateral environmental cooperation efforts. Looking \nacross the MEAs it is striking that general export openness plays most of a role in \nexactly those treaties that contain elaborate trade restrictive measures, namely the \nRotterdam Convention, the Montreal Protocol and CITES. General export \n                                                                                                                                     \n11\n As explained in the last section, this variable needs to be treated with caution, however, due to its \n26 \nopenness might therefore only promote multilateral environmental cooperation in \nthose cases were significant trade-relevant provisions are at stake. Whether \nspecific trade interests promote or hinder countries\u2019 willingness to cooperate in \nMEAs depends on whether the MEA under consideration is likely to threaten or \naccommodate the interests of exporters. Fossil fuel exporters have much to lose \nfrom the Kyoto Protocol, hence they are less likely to have signed it. The same is \npossibly true for countries producing crops that are genetically modified in the \ncase of the Biosafety Protocol. For the Montreal Protocol and CITES, however, \nspecific export interests might have helped to bring about multilateral \nenvironmental cooperation. \nFor successful MEAs to be negotiated, signed and speedily ratified political \ncommitment by the community of nation states is necessary. Trade openness \nmight help as this article has tried to demonstrate. Clearly, however, more \nresearch is warranted on this important issue. Questions worth investigating \ninclude whether this paper\u2019s results remain valid for other MEAs and for other \nindicators or proxy variables for multilateral environmental cooperation, however \ndifficult finding these might be. \n \n \nREFERENCES \nBarbieri, Katherine (1996), \u2018Economic Interdependence: A Path to Peace or a \nSource of Interstate Conflict?\u2019, Journal of Peace Research, 33, 1, 29-49. \n                                                                                                                                     \nlow variation (only six countries grow crops on a large scale that are genetically modified). \n27 \nBeck, Nathaniel, Jonathan N.
