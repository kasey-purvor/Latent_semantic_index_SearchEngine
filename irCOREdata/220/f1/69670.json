INTRODUCTION \nWhilst mobile phones have become more sophisticated in terms of \nadditional functionality and hardware features, their user \ninterfaces have remained largely unchanged and are optimized for \nnumber entry rather than intensive interaction with on-board \napplications. This limitation has proved a significant factor for \nmobile games which have failed to produce the large volume sales \noriginally predicted [7].  Similarly, the view that 3D games would \nbe the dominant force in the mobile games market [7], as in the \nconsole and pc games market, has also failed to materialize, and \nthe dominant genre is in fact casual gaming [1]. Despite the \ngrowth in support for 3D graphics on mobile phones [1] the lack \nof evolution of the mobile interface [2] is arguably part of the \nreason why 3D games in particular have failed to make a \nsignificant impact on the market. Indeed as the one button game \ncontrol is seen as the ideal interface for mobile games [5] it has \nbeen hard to imagine how a 3D action game could possibly \nmatched to this concept. \nHaving said that the mobile phone interface has remained largely \nstatic does not mean that there has not been some innovation most \nnotablyis probably Apples iPhone multi-touch display. Another \nfeature on the iPhone which certainly eases the users experience is \nthe use of an accelerometer sensor to detect \u2018tilt\u2019 i.e. the \norientation of the phone and then display visual content (images, \nwebsites, text or videos) in the appropriate orientation. However, \nthis functionality was not new or unique to the iPhone and a \nnumber of commercial mobile phones models have appeared with \naccelerometers [8]which are accessible through software running \non open mobile platforms. This functionality therefore presents a \nnew opportunity for game developers and is the concern of this \nresearch. \nWhilst some use of accelerometers in mobile games has occurred \nin relation to using tilt control for games running on the phones \n[4] or utilizing the phone as a Wii like controller for games \nrunning on large  public screens [8] they have limited the control \nto the 2-D visual plane of screen allowing movement  horizontally \n(left and right) or vertically (front and back). Whilst this is an \nacceptable approach for 2-D games it tends to limit the range of \napplicable 3D games which often require full 3D navigation \ncapabilities in their 3D environments.  \nTo this end the Mirage-X Application Programming Interface \n(API) has been created [2] was created to allow instinctive 3D \nnavigation capabilities through 3D augmented reality worlds. In \nthis paper we discuss its extension for use in games in relation to \nthe design and implementation of a novel motion controlled 3D \nmultiplayer space combat game we have called \u2018Mirage Space\u201d \ntogether with the results from the first user experience trials. \n2. GAME API \n2.1 Overview \nWhilst there are is range of possible software environments for the \nproduction of 3D games on mobile phones [1] the Symbian \nOperating System (OS)  was chosen as it is not only the most \nprevalent Smartphone OS [3] it also incorporates OpenGL \nEmbedded Systems (ES) which is a 3D graphics library targeted \nat resource constrained devices such as mobile phones. The \nadvantage of OpenGL ES is that is a lightweight well-defined \nsubset of desktop OpenGL which is widely used console and pc \ngames industry. \nThe API is designed to provide Symbian games developers with \nan intuitive means of providing navigation through 3D worlds \nallowing players to control this navigation simply by moving the \nphone. The accelerometer sensors therefore detects the players \nmovement of the phone in the physical world relays this as \norientation information to OpenGL ES which then generates the \nrelative 3D view directions and renders it on screen.  \n \nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for \npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are \nnot made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that \ncopies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

The advantage \nto the games developer is that the API hides all the orientation and \nrendering details by presenting a set of functions that facilitate the \nintegration of motion sensitivity into their applications. \n \n \nFigure 1. Motion Navigation of 3D Environment \nOne of the major benefits that the API provides is that helps \nmaintain the players\u2019 line-of-sight direction to always be \nperpendicular to the phone\u2019s screen as demonstrated in Figure 2.a. \nThe player tends to naturally follow the phone as it moves in the \nphysical world to follow the move in the 3D game world. For \ninstance, the user raises their head up when tilting the phone \nupwards in order to incline in the virtual world as illustrated in \nFigure 2. This consistency of line-of-sight gives full view of the \nscreen display at all times without it being skewed away as can \nhappen in other sensor-controlled interfaces where the user tilts \nthe phone independently from their eye sight direction giving as a \nresult narrower screen surface projection on the eyes and poorer \ninteraction experience [4] as demonstrated for Figure 2.c \n3. MULTIPLAYER GAME \n3.1 Overview \nTo illustrate the use of the API and examine the use of this novel \ninteraction on the user experience of the game play it is illustrated \nthrough an innovative  mobile game which has be called Mirage \nSpace and is a motion controlled 3D space battle game in which \nplayers compete with opponents via Bluetooth to save the galaxy.  \nThe trial version discussed in this paper is for two players \nalthough the game itself has been designed to accommodate up to \nfour.  \n3.2 Controls \nThe game is initiated from the main screen from which players \nneed to select start and then choose a space ship in one of four \ncolors. The game then initiates the procedure for Bluetooth \nconnection and it requires at least one of players phone to act as \nthe game server and the other 3 players act as client. Once the \nserver phone has found all phones in client mode running the \ngame each client player then needs to accept the request from the \nserver to start the game. \n \n \nFigure 2. Player Screen View \nOnce the game is started the players is presented with the game \nview and controls shown in Figure 3. The movement of the ship \nup\/down and left\/right is controlled by the player through \nmovement of the phone as previously illustrated in Figure 1, \nwhilst the speed of the ship is controlled using up\/down on the \nphone joy pad and the fire button is the centre of the joy pad.. The \nspeed is displayed by a variable height bar of the left of the screen \nas shown, and the player damage\/health meter is shown as a \nvariable length bar on the top right. The players can sustain \ndamage by either being shot by an opposing player or colliding \nwith asteroids or opponents all of which are indicated to the \nplayer using the sound of an explosion and the phone vibrating. At \nthe centre of the screen is the users gun sight which changes from \nwhite to red when an enemy is within range of the gun. The final \nelement indicated on the screen is a enemy targeting sight which \nis used as part of the navigation which will be discussed in the \nfollowing section. \n \nFigure 3. Player Controls and Information Assets \n3.3 Navigation \nThe navigation for this game proved to be one of the more \nchallenging aspects of the game than originally envisaged. As \nplayers are flying around a \u2018large\u2019 game world at speed, battling \ntheir opponents, some means of identifying their opponents \nposition relative to their own is required otherwise it is easy to \nbecome separated within the game world. This was much more \nevident than in our previous games [2, 4] were the natural division \nbetween either land and sky or game objects provided a frame of \nreference. The final solution used within the user experience \ntesting was to incorporate a smaller targeting cursor as shown in \nFigure 3 and 4. For each enemy ship a cursor shows the relative \ndirection of that opponent to position of the player. The cursor \nchanges from white to blue when the opponent is behind the \nplayer as show in the left screen shot of Figure 4. In this way \nplayers can combat their opponents much more effectively. \n \nFigure 4. Enemy Targeting Indicator used for Navigation \n4. USER EXPERIENCE \nWhilst a number of early tests were carried out during the \ndevelopment phase, particularly in relation to control and \nnavigation, the following results are from the first user experience \ntrials held in Infolab21 at Lancaster University in July 2008 and \nwas obtained through a short questionnaire and observation.  \nIn total sixteen volunteers were recruited of which eleven were \nmale and five were female. There ages ranged from 17 to 47 with \nthe average age being 28. Although the ultimate aim for the game \nis to support up to four players in each game, for this trial we \nrestricted the games to two players with each pair asked to play at \nleast two games ( although in end most pairs played four or more \ngames) before answering a short questionnaire. In this section we \nwill present the results from this first trial. \n4.1 Subject Gaming Habits \nAll of the subjects in the user trial owned a PC and a phone and \nten also owned a games console. In relation to computer game \nplaying habits four described themselves as regular game players \nand of the rest, seven described themselves as occasional player \nwith the remaining saying they never played computer games. \nWhen asked the same question in relation to mobile games only \none person described themselves as regular player with eight \nplaying occasionally and seven never playing mobile games \ndespite all players having a game of some form on their phone. \nThirteen of the group had never played a 3D mobile game and the \nremaining three had played a 3D game but in all cases this turned \nout to be the 3D version of Snake which comes as part of the \nsoftware build on many Nokia phones. \n4.2 Control \nAt the start of the trials we briefly introduced the players to the \nbasic game controls previously illustrated in Figure 3 and it \nquickly became evident that motion control was a much more \nwidely understood concept that evident in earlier research [4] no \ndoubt due in part to the considerable success of the Nintendo Wii .  \nIn terms of the general control of the ship we asked the users how \neasy it was to control the space ship and amongst the players two \nsaid they found it \u2018easy from the start\u2019 and two said it was \n\u2018difficult\u2019, although both the players who found it difficult had \ndescribed themselves as non game players, and the rest said it was \n\u2018easy once they had got used to it\u2019.  \nIn terms of comparing the interface to a traditional joystick \ncontrolled game, twelve said it was harder than on a PC or \nconsole but all found it easier than using the joy pad on the phone.  \nThe players were also queried about the speed of the game, which \nin essence was controlled by the users, as it was felt useful to \nobtain a general perception of whether the game should provide a \ngreater range of settings. Although fourteen of the players found \nthe speed to be \u2018about right\u2019, and only two said it was \u2018too fast\u2019, a \nnumber of the players said that they had difficulty perceiving the \nspeed of the ship when going forward in a straight line. This result \nwas interesting as it had not been evident in the other single player \n3D games produced in the course of the research [2]. In the single \nplayer game, termed Mirage Money [2], users collected spinning \ncoins in a virtual or augmented (using the phone camera) space by \nflying towards the coins. In essence the coins were replaced by \nasteroids in Mirage Space but it seemed that because of their \nirregular shape the players did not get the same sense of speed \nwhen moving towards them. To overcome this problem we \npropose to either make the asteroid shape more regular in future \nversions of the game or to introduce a motion effect of possibly \nblurred lines to indicate differences in speed. \n4.3 Navigation \nDespite navigation proving a problem during the development of \nthe game the final solution appeared to be very successful with \ntwelve players finding it \u2018good once they got used to it\u2019 with the \nremaining four split equally between finding it \u2018easy from the \nstart\u2019 or \u2018somewhat confusing\u2019 overall. As in the case of difficulty \nwith the interface the players who found it hard to navigate both \ndescribed themselves as non game players. This is not to say that \nthis result is not important but rather highlights that a level of \nunderstanding of general game play mechanics [6] has been \nassumed that possibly indicates the need for a stronger tutorial \nelement to the game should be provided in order to reach a wider \naudience.  \nOne common request amongst players again related to having a \nframe of reference within in the game world to ease navigation as \nhighlighted previously when discussing the perception of game \nspeed. One possible solution would be to introduce a more \nregimented sky box with easily identifiable planets or star \nconstellations to provide reference points. \n4.4 Player Interaction \nAs the game was designed specifically for multiplayer operation \none of the elements keenly observed within the trial group was \nhow the players interacted during the game experience. This \ninteraction manifested itself in a number of ways such as shouts of \ntriumph, such as \u2018YES\u2019, or groans of loss, for example \u2018NOOOO\u2019, \ntogether with more general taunting, such as \u2018Loser\u2019, of bragging \nlike \u2018GOTCHA\u2019 during the game play.  \nIt was noticeable that despite the fact that Bluetooth connectivity \nwould allow the players to operate the game anywhere up to 10 \nmeters apart they always aligned themselves in close proximity. \nThis was evidently in order to facilitate the afore mentioned \nverbal interaction. In fact the users generally either stood face to \nface (only observed between pairs of men) in a slightly \nconfrontational relationship as shown on the right of  Figure 5 or \nmore commonly side by side as shown on the  left of Figure 5 \nduring which players regularly glanced across to each other as if \nto affirm the interaction. \nOverall the experience of the users seemed extremely positive \nwith a great deal of laughter and delight evident throughout the \nprocess. All the users rated the game a great fun to play and were \nhighly interested in seeing more motion controlled games and \nwould definitely play this type of game again.  \n \nFigure 5. Player Positioning \n5. FURTHER WORK \nThere are a number of requirements for extending this research \nand whilst some preliminary alteration of the navigation and \nenvironment to facilitate easier reference within the game are \nrequired the general perception of control and navigation seemed \nvery positive. In the next round of trials, after some of the \naforementioned modifications, games of four players will be \nconsidered   to ascertain whether increasing the number players \nchanges the user experience dramatically or whether it is a simple \nscaling process particularly in relation to the interaction between \nindividuals. For instance it will be interesting to observe whether \nusers tend to play as individuals or whether alliances are formed \nand broken dynamically during game play. \nOne development under consideration is whether to provide an \nopen release of the game on a file sharing site to get a wider and \nmore extensive trial experience. The only drawback to this would \nbe that without a single player option, which would mean \ndeveloping a suitable Artificial Intelligence opponent the game \nmight not playable by sufficient numbers of people. This could be \novercome by replacing the Bluetooth connectivity with 3G \nconnectivity. The drawback to this would be that you would lose \nthe high levels social interaction evident during the trials and thus \nradically alter the general game experience.   \nIn terms of the overall game API a number of extensions are being \ndeveloped to allow greater incorporation of augmented reality \nusing the camera [2] and the on-board GPS on the phone so actual \nplayer movement through space could form a game element \nalthough this would obviously restrict the game play to outdoors. \n6. CONCLUSIONS \nWith the huge impact the Wii\u2122 has made in the traditional \nconsole market it is evident that a fun and appealing interface can \nenable games to engage a much broader game playing \ndemographic and encourage greater social interaction within the \ngames themselves. As mobile phones, and mobile games, are \nalready impacting on new game playing audiences it seems \nnatural to explore new interface mechanisms on a device where \nthe traditional keypad input limits the opportunity for game play. \nIn this research project, we explored the use of in-built 3D \naccelerometers appearing in many new mobile phones as an \ninterface for a multiplayer mobile phone games. In particular we \nexplored its use in a graphics intensive 3D multi-player space \n\u2018shoot-em-up game\u2019. The overall response was extremely positive \nand the strong social interaction gives us reason to explore the \ninterface further across a broader range of games and in particular \naddress a much broader age range of players which was not \nrepresented by this initial study.  \nOverall, we believe that this research clearly illustrates that 3D \naccelerometers in phones offers a wealth of new interaction \npossibilities beyond the current keyboard restrictions and free not \nonly game developers but all mobile application developers to \nexplore new interaction paradigms on mobile phones. \n7.
