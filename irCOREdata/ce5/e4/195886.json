Identification of specific \nsub-phenotypes may further our understanding of pathophysiology, treatment response, \nprognosis and the underlying genetic basis for the disease. An accurate and \ncomprehensive system of classification therefore remains an important priority for \nasthma research despite the effort of many clinicians over several generations. \n \nA review of the phenotypic characterisation of asthma was published in this journal in \n2007 [1]. In brief, we covered the eosinophilic versus neutrophilic pathological \nphenotypes, discussed refractory asthma as a distinct inflammatory phenotype, with \nparticular focus on the role of TNF  in severe disease, and discussed phenotype-specific \nasthma management.  The purpose of this review is to discuss recent data of relevance to \nthis field and the previous text will not be repeated. \n \nMulti-dimensional phenotyping \nThere are numerous classifications of asthma based on proposed aetiology (allergic, non-\nallergic, occupational), pathology (eosinophilic, non-eosinophilic), severity and \nphysiological parameters (type I brittle, type II brittle) [1]. In an attempt to provide a \nmore integrated classification of asthma taking into account multidimensional \nparameters, we undertook k-means cluster analysis in three populations of asthmatic \npatients [2]\u2022\u2022. The first group of patients were identified in primary care (n=184), and had \npredominantly mild to moderate asthma. The second group (n=187) were recruited from \nthe Glenfield Hospital Difficult Asthma Clinic with predominantly refractory asthma, \n 4 \nwhile the third group (n=68) had been studied previously with respect to targeting the \nsputum eosinophil count to reduce asthma exacerbations [3] .  \n \nTo determine the most appropriate variables for cluster modelling, we first performed \nprincipal components analysis of 16 common clinical measurements and identified \nfactors representative of symptoms, atopy\/allergy, eosinophilic inflammation, \npsychological status, and variable airflow obstruction. So that the cluster analysis was not \nweighted, only one parameter that was representative of each factor was included in the \nmodel. These were: atopic status (allergy domain), peak expiratory flow variability \nmeasured as amplitude percent mean of the lowest and highest readings over 2 weeks \n(variable airflow obstruction domain), induced sputum eosinophil count (airway \ninflammation domain),  and a modified Juniper Asthma Control Score to represent \nsymptoms alone (symptoms domain). Psychological status was considered a consequence \nof the disease and therefore not included as an input parameter. However, performing the \ncluster analysis with the inclusion of the anxiety score (the parameter with the higher \nloading coefficient in the principal components analysis) did not alter the structure of the \nclusters. Gender, age and body mass index did not load significantly on the factor model \nbut were considered significant determinants of the asthma phenotype and were also \nincluded. Methacholine PC20, measured using the tidal breathing method was included \nfor the primary care population only, as it had only been measured in 10% of the \nrefractory patients in cases of diagnostic doubt.  \n \n 5 \nThe results of the study are summarised in figure 1 (need permission). In the primary care \npopulation there were three distinct clusters. The first cluster described a subgroup with \nearly-onset atopic asthma, with evidence of airway dysfunction, symptoms, and \neosinophilic airway inflammation. Clinically, this cohort was associated with a \nsignificantly greater number of previous hospital attendances and asthma exacerbations \nrequiring oral corticosteroids when compared with the other primary-care subgroups. \nCluster 2 described an obese subgroup with a female preponderance, evidence of asthma \nsymptoms, and an absence of eosinophilic airway inflammation. The third cluster had \nvery little evidence of active asthma, a low rate of asthma exacerbations, and it is likely \nthat a proportion of these patients did not have asthma at all. This cluster was labelled as \n\u201cbenign asthma\u201d.   \n \nIn the difficult asthma population, 4 distinct clusters were identified (figure 1).  \nTwo of these were similar to those in the primary care population, i.e the early-onset \natopic asthma cluster and the obese, non-eosinophilic cluster. The main difference \nbetween patients in these clusters in primary versus secondary care was that patients in \nsecondary care had more severe objective markers of disease. In addition, patients in the \nearly-onset atopic group in secondary care had a higher rate of failed clinic appointments \ncompared to the other refractory clusters, suggesting that perhaps with improved \nconcordance, they could be better controlled.  \n \nTwo further clusters in the severe asthma cohort were specific for severe disease. One of \nthese was a group of patients with refractory eosinophilic disease, with recurrent \n 6 \nexacerbations, but relatively few symptoms. These patients were described as \ninflammation predominant although eosinophilic inflammation predominant would be \nmore accurate to remove any confusion with neutrophilic inflammation. The other \nsevere-specific cluster was a group of patients with early onset atopic disease with \nvirtually no eosinophilic inflammation but very high symptom expression.  \n \nThe importance of identifying these clusters in severe disease with respect to treatment \napproaches was highlighted by further analysis of a group of refractory asthmatic \npatients. These patients had been entered previously into a prospective randomised \nclinical trial comparing standard care versus treatment guided by the sputum eosinophil \ncount on the rate of asthma exacerbations [3]. This study demonstrated that when \ncorticosteroid treatment is guided by the sputum eosinophil count, there is a 60% \nreduction in severe asthma exacerbations and a significant reduction in hospital \nadmissions.  When cluster analysis was applied to the patients in this study, three distinct \nclusters matching those described above were identified (eosinophilic inflammation \npredominant, obese female, early-onset symptom predominant). Cluster-specific analysis \nrevealed that all of the benefit for preventing exacerbations occurred in the eosinophilic \ninflammation-predominant cohort (3.53 [SD, 1.18] vs. 0.38 [SD, 0.13] \nexacerbation\/patient\/yr, p=0.002). In addition, sputum-guided therapy allowed successful \ndowntitration of corticosteroid therapy in early-onset symptom-predominant asthma \n(mean difference, 1,829 g beclomethasone equivalent\/d [95% confidence interval, 307\u2013\n349 g]; p= 0.02), without compromising asthma control. \n \n 7 \nThe identification of these clusters is the first major advance in the complex \nclinicopathological phenotyping of asthma. It will contribute to the tailored treatment of \npatients with appropriate therapies, and help to avoid the overuse of corticosteroids in \npatients who do not have corticosteroid responsive disease. The authors believe that this \nstudy is a landmark study in the phenotyping of clinical asthma. The challenge now is to \nidentify the factors which lead to the development and sustained expression of these \ndifferent phenotypes, and to develop novel phenotype-specific therapies. \n \nMolecular Phenotyping \nGene arrays are a powerful tool for the unbiased examination of gene expression \nprogrammes in tissues, and are now being used to examine the gene expression profiles \nin asthmatic airways.  In an initial study, Woodruff and colleagues identified periostin \n(POSTN), chloride channel regulator 1 (CLCA1), and serpin peptidase inhibitor, clade B, \nmember 2 (SERPINB2) as epithelial genes that were specifically induced in asthma (as \ncompared to both healthy controls and smokers with mild-moderate COPD), and directly \nregulated by IL-13 in vitro [4]. In a further study, they therefore used this gene \nexpression signature as a surrogate marker of the IL-13 inflammatory pathway [5]\u2022\u2022. \nThey hypothesised that this could be used to identify subsets of patients with asthma who \ndiffer in terms of the molecular mechanisms underlying their airway pathology, and that \nthese subsets would constitute distinct inflammatory, pathological and clinical \nphenotypes.  \n \n 8 \nFor the analysis, the researchers used microarray and PCR analyses of airway epithelial \nbrushings from 42 mild-to moderate corticosteroid-na\u00efve asthmatics and 28 healthy \ncontrols. Using unsupervised hierarchical clustering, they identified that approximately \n50% (n=22) of the asthmatic subjects had consistently high expression of Th2 cytokine-\ninduced genes, while the remaining 20 asthmatic subjects were not distinguishable from \nnormal controls [5]\u2022\u2022.  These observations were validated on bronchial biopsies using \nquantitiative PCR to detect Th2 cytokine mRNA. IL-5 and IL-13 mRNA expression was \nmarkedly increased in the Th2-high cluster compared to the Th2-low cluster or healthy \ncontrols. The Th2-low group of asthmatics did not differ from normal controls in their \nexpression of IL-5 or IL-13 mRNA. IL-4 expression was low across all groups which \nmay relate to the instability of IL-4 gene expression as IL-4 mRNA and protein \nexpression is consistently increased in situ in steroid-na\u00efve asthma [6,7].  IL-5 and IL-13 \nexpression were highly correlated. In keeping with the reciprocal balance hypothesis \nregarding Th1 versus Th2 expression, Th1 cytokine expression was significantly lower in \nthe Th2-high group. These findings were highly reproducible when re-analysed in \nbronchial biopsy material obtained from a second bronchoscopy a week later. These \nfindings support earlier work looking at IL-13 protein expression bronchial biopsies and \ninduced sputum, with IL-13 detectable in about 50% of steroid na\u00efve patients [8]. \n \nWith respect to clinical features, Th2-high and -low asthma were indistinguishable in \nterms of demographic characteristics, lung function and bronchodilator reversibility. Both \ngroups were atopic, but the Th2 group had more extensive sensitisation. Interestingly, the \nTh2-high group had significantly worse bronchial hyperesponsiveness, higher serum IgE, \n 9 \ngreater eosinophilia (blood and BAL). The Th2-high group also had evidence of \nsubepithelial fibrosis, a feature of eosinophilic asthma [9], whereas this was not present \nin Th2-low asthma. Epithelial mucin stores were also significantly increased in Th2-high \nasthma.  \n \nA very important finding was that only the Th2-high group responded clinically to a \ncourse of inhaled corticosteroids, with significant improvements in FEV1. These findings \nare therefore entirely consistent with earlier work showing that patients with non-\neosinophilic asthma defined by sputum eosinophil count do not respond to inhaled \nsteroids [9,10], and suggests that the Th2-low group identified here, equates to the non-\neosinophilic phenotype, and the early-onset symptom predominant non-eosinophilic \ncluster in the study from Haldar and colleagues. This Th2-low, non eosinophilic group \ntherefore defines a group of asthmatics with an unmet clinical need. It also suggests that \npatients with Th2-low asthma are unlikely to respond to Th2-specific therapy (vide infra). \n \nAnother study sought to discriminate asthma phenotypes on the basis of cytokine profiles \nin bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in samples from patients with mild-moderate and \nsevere asthma [11]\u2022. Out of 25 cytokines measured in the BAL samples \nof 84 patients (41 severe, 43 mild-moderate) using bead-based multiplex immunoassays, \n18 were detectable and included in the analysis. Initial unsupervised agglomerative \nhierarchical clustering delineated four subgroups of asthma that were independent of \ntreatment. One group was said to be enriched for patients with severe asthma, although \nthese only accounted for 60% of this group compared to ~50% of the total cohort. This \n 10 \ncluster had high concentrations of BAL IL-2 and reduced FEV1, FVC and bronchodilator \nresponse compared to the other clusters. Classification methods for predicting \nmethacholine sensitivity were also developed, and identified 3 distinct hyperresponder \nclasses that varied in BAL eosinophil count and PC20 methacholine. This study \ndemonstrates that BAL cytokine profiles have potential to identify subgroups of asthma \npatients, but at this stage raises more questions that it answers.   \n \nPhenotype-specific treatment: Anti-IL-5 therapy. \nBecause it is clear that not all asthma is the same, it is essential that new treatments for \nasthma are tested in those patients most likely to respond. In the past this has occurred \nfortuitously for 2-agonists, as nearly all clinical trials of asthma have required beta-\nagonist reversibility as an entry criteria, and thus beta-agonist trials are usually \nfavourable. In practice however, FEV1 reversibility of  >12%, a common entry \nrequirement, is only present in 30% of our difficult asthma patients, and so it is still \nunclear how much benefit long-acting beta-agonists for example give to patients with \npoor bronchodilator responses.  \n \nFor newer immunomodulators, it unlikely that a therapy such as anti-IL-5 which targets \neosinophilic inflammation, will be effective in non-eosinophilic disease. The first \npublished trials of anti-IL-5 treatment were disappointing [12-15], but took \u201call-comers\u201d \nwith asthma, which will have included patients with both eosinophilic and non-\neosinophilic disease. Anti-IL-5 antibodies were very effective at reducing sputum and \nblood eosinophil counts, and reduced tissue eosinophils by approximately 60% [16], but \n 11 \nasthma symptoms continued unabated, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness did not \nimprove. Furthermore, there was no attenuation of the airway response to experimental \nallergen challenge, suggesting that eosinophils are also not important for this [13]. It has \nbeen argued that a 60% reduction in eosinophils within the tissue may not be adequate to \nreduce their pathological effects, but this seems unlikely because the reduction in \neosinophils correlates strongly with a reduction in the deposition of tenascin, lumican, \nand procollagen III in the lamina reticularis [16]. \n \nThese results with anti-IL-5 suggested that eosinophils do not play an important role in \nday-to-day asthma symptoms, variable airflow obstruction or hyperresponsiveness. \nHowever, it is known that eosinophils represent an excellent biomarker for predicting \nwhether patients will respond to corticosteroids [9,10], predicting which patients are at \nrisk of exacerbations, and for guiding steroid therapy with a view to preventing these \nevents [3]. This suggested that eosinophils might play a role in the pathophysiology of \nacute exacerbations but the early anti-IL-5 studies were not powered or designed to test \nthis. There was a non-significant trend towards reduced asthma exacerbations in one anti-\nIL-5 trial [15].  \n \nIn view of these data, we undertook a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind \nparallel group study of anti-IL-5 treatment (Mepolizumab) in patients with severe asthma \nwith evidence of eosinophilic inflammation and at least 2 severe exacerbations in the \nprevious 12 months [17]\u2022\u2022. The primary outcome was the number of severe exacerbations \nover the 12 month treatment phase.  \n 12 \n \nPatients were eligible if they met the ATS definition of refractory asthma, had a sputum \neosinophil count of  >3% on at least one occasion in the previous 2 years in spite of high \ndose inhaled or oral corticosteroid therapy, and at least 2 severe asthma exacerbations in \nthe preceding 12 months. Out of 449 patients in our refractory asthma clinic database, \n149 (33%) were potentially eligible. Out of 110 patients approached, 63 were assessed \nfor eligibility, and 61 underwent randomisation.  \n \nWith respect to the primary outcome, there was a marked reduction in the number of \nexacerbations in the patients receiving anti-IL-5 (2.0 per patient) compared to those \nreceiving placebo (3.4 per patient, p=0.02) (figure 2) (need permission). Furthermore, we \nsaw a significant improvement in quality of life score, suggesting that exacerbations have \na significant impact of quality of life. Interestingly, there were no differences in lung \nfunction, airway hyperresponsiveness or symptoms between the active treatment group \nand controls. Also of great interest, treatment with oral prednisolone at the end of the \nstudy, led to improvements in lung function and symptoms in both the placebo and anti-\nIL-5 groups. This suggests that symptoms and lung function can be disassociated from \neosinophilic inflammation, and are improved by corticosteroids through another \nmechanism. This work therefore indicates that in patients with eosinophilic asthma, \neosinophils contribute to the pathophysiology of exacerbations, but not day-to-day \nasthma. \n \n 13 \nA second smaller study of Mepolizumab therapy in patients with persisting sputum \neosinophilia in spite of oral steroid therapy was also published at the same time [18]\u2022\u2022. \nAgain, this study demonstrated a marked reduction in exacerbations in the anti-IL-5 \ngroup, at the same time as extensive steroid tapering. These studies were the subject of \nrather negative editorial in the same issue of the N Engl J Med [19]. The editorialist \nsuggested that the patients studied represented a minority of asthma patients, and \ntherefore that anti-IL-5 will be of limited use. We disagree strongly. Thirty three percent \nof our difficult asthma clinic population were eliglible, and the results were remarkable.  \n \nSince anti-IL-5 targets exacerbations but not symptoms or lung function, it will be \ninteresting to see if dual therapy with anti-IL-5 and IL-13 targets a broader aspect of \nclinical features in patients with Th2-driven eosinophilic asthma \n \nMacrolide therapy \nAs shown in figure 1, a proportion of patients with severe asthma have non-eosinophilic \ndisease, and it is known that a proportion of these have evidence of neutrophilic \ninflammation [20]. Using standard clinical measurements such as spirometry and airway \nchallenges, it is not possible to separate eosinophilic from non-eosinophilic asthma. \nPatients with non-eosinophilic disease do not respond clinically to inhaled \ncorticosteroids, and do not appear to respond well to oral corticosteroids [2,9].  \n \nMacrolide antibiotics are of interest as they are known to have anti-neutrophilic \nproperties [21]. Simpson and colleagues therefore performed a randomised double-blind \n 14 \nplacebo controlled trial of clarithromycin therapy for 8 weeks in 46 patients with severe \nasthma [22]\u2022\u2022. In the treated group there were significant reductions in the number of \nsputum neutrophils and IL-8 concentrations, and a significant improvement in quality of \nlife. When the data were analysed in subgroups with eosinophilic versus non-eosinophilic \ndisease, the benefit was confined to those with non-eosinophilic disease. This supports \nthe view that an anti-neutrophil approach may be beneficial in in non-eosinophilic \nasthma, and the results of a larger randomised controlled trial of macrolide therapy in \nsevere non-eosinophilic asthma are awaited.  \n \nConclusion \nThese studies carry a very important message for the investigation of new therapies. It is \nclearly essential to choose an outcome that is likely to be responsive to the intervention, \nand to chose an intervention for an appropriate patient group. For example, in severe \nasthma, IL-13 is only present in the airways in about 50% of subjects [23]\u2022 . Treating \npatients with anti-IL-13 when it is already suppressed might be predicted to fail. There is \nan obsession with using bronchodilator reversibility of >12% as an entry criteria in \nclinical trials of asthma. In our mepolizumab study, mean bronchodilator reversibility \nwas only 9%. Importantly, post hoc analysis of the Mepolizumab group showed that the \npatients who received the greatest benefit from treatment, were those with an FEV1 \nbronchodilator response of <50 ml [24]\u2022. So while reversibility is a potentially useful \ndiagnostic marker of asthma, using it as an essential entry criteria leads to recruitment of \na highly specific subset of asthmatics, which will doom some treatments to failure. So for \n 15 \nfuture trials of Mepolizumab, we would urge that bronchodilator reversibility is not an \nessential entry requirement.  \n \nIn summary, the clinical and molecular phenotyping approaches discussed in this article \nare a significant advance in our understanding of the pathophysiology of asthma, \nrevealing several distinct subclinical phenotypes, driven by different pathophysiological \nmechanisms. Clustering methodology to describe phenotypes is likely to become \nincreasingly popular both clinically and at a molecular level, and we envisage that the \ntwo types of research will converge so that phenotypes defined rigorously by both \nclinical and molecular parameters will be achieved. This should help identify reliable \nbiomarkers as well. The challenge now is to target these subphenotypes with appropriate \nexisting and novel therapies. It is no longer helpful to think of asthma as a single disease \nentity for which one treatment will treat all patients.  \n 16 \n  \nReference List \n \n 1.  Green RH, Brightling CE, Bradding P.
