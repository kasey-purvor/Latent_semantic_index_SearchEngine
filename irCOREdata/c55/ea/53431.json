It has been successfully applied in various applications.  Recently, fuzzy-model-based control \napproach has been employed to synchronize chaotic systems, which is a useful application in \ncommunication system to ensure a secure communication. \n In fuzzy-model-based control approach, generally, T-S fuzzy model [1] is employed to describe \nthe dynamical behaviors of the response and drive chaotic systems.  It was shown in [2] that most \ncommon chaotic systems can be represented by T-S fuzzy models with simple rules.  Based on the T-S \nfuzzy model, a fuzzy state-feedback controller [3] is then designed to realize the synchronization.  Under \na design criterion that the grades of membership of both response and drive chaotic system are known, \nLMI-based exact linearization conditions were given to design a fuzzy state-feedback controller to \nsynchronize two identical chaotic systems.  In [2], this design criterion was alleviated by using the H\uf0a5 \ntracking control approach.  Under the approach in [2], the grades of membership of the drive chaotic \nsystem are not necessarily known and the tracking performance is guaranteed by an H\uf0a5 tracking \nperformance index.  The fuzzy-model-based control approach has combined with adaptive ability [3]-[4] \nto deal with chaotic systems subject to parameter uncertainties.  With the outstanding approximation \nability of the fuzzy system, the uncertain parameter values of the chaotic systems can be estimated in an \nonline manner according to some update rules.  A fuzzy controller can generate an appropriate control \naction based on the estimated parameters.  The adaptive fuzzy approach offers a superior robustness \nproperty, however, computational demand and structural complexity of the controller are increased.  In \nsome operating environment, the system state information of the drive chaotic system reaches the \nresponses system with time delay owing to the long-distance transmission.  Under such a situation, the \ncurrent state information of the drive chaotic system cannot be obtained to realize the synchronization.  \nSynchronization using time-delayed feedback control was also investigated.  Linear controller using \nconstant time-delayed system state information of both drive and response chaotic system, and the current \nsystem state information of response chaotic system was proposed to realize the synchronization.  Both \ntime-delay independent and dependent stability conditions were derived using the Lyapunov-Krasovksii \nfunction.  This delayed-feedback control approach was extended to adaptive fuzzy framework [5]. \n \nNOVELTY AND METHOD \n In this paper, a fuzzy controller is proposed to synchronize two chaotic systems.  The fuzzy \ncontroller makes use of current system state information of the response chaotic system and the time-\ndelayed system state information of the drive chaotic system to realize the synchronization.  The time \ndelay to be considered is time varying and uncertain in value.  It is due to this reason, the proposed fuzzy \nstate-feedback controller cannot use the time-delayed system state information of the response chaotic \nsystem compared with the linear control and the adaptive fuzzy control [5] approaches of which constant \ntime delay was considered.  To cope with the time-varying delay, the boundedness property of the system \nstates of the drive chaotic system is taken advantage to investigate system stability.  Furthermore, the \nPreferred for of presentation:  Oral, Category Code:  1.1 Synchronization and control of chaos \n 2 \nparameter uncertainties of the chaotic systems eliminate the favourable properties of the fuzzy-model-\nbased control approach to facilitate the stability analysis and produce relaxed stability conditions [3], [5].  \nTo alleviate the difficulties introduced by parameter uncertainties, membership functions of both fuzzy \nmodel and fuzzy controller are considered.  Consequently, some free matrices are allowed to be \nintroduced to the stability conditions to ease the stability analysis and produce less conservative stability \nconditions.  LMI-based stability conditions are derived to aid the design of a fuzzy controller to realize \nthe synchronization. \n \n LMI-based stability conditions governing the system stability of the fuzzy-model-based chaotic \nsystems with time-delay fuzzy controller have been obtained.  The system performance of the chaotic \nsynchronization of two chaotic systems is guaranteed by an H\uf0a5 performance function.  The following \nfigure 1 shows the system state responses of the response (dotted lines) and drive (solid lines) R\u00f6ssler \nsystems with u(t) = 0 for 0 \uf0a3 t < 50s and the proposed fuzzy controller applied for t \uf0b3 50s with the time \ndelay of \uf028 \uf029\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6 \uf02b\n\uf02b\uf03d\n4\n)sin(1101.0)( ttd\uf074 .  Both the chaotic system are subject to parameter uncertainties.  Fig. \n2 shows the tracking error.  It can be seen that the proposed fuzzy controller is able to synchronize both \nthe response and drive chaotic systems subject to parameter uncertainties and time-varying delay. \n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\n-10\n0\n10\n20\nx 1\n(t)\n a\nnd\n x\n1^(\nt)\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\n-20\n-10\n0\n10\nx 2\n(t)\n a\nnd\n x\n2^(\nt)\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\n-100\n-50\n0\n50\nTime (sec)\nx 3\n(t)\n a\nnd\n x\n3^(\nt)\n \n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\n-20\n0\n20\ne 1\n(t)\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\n-20\n0\n20\ne 2\n(t)\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\n-50\n0\n50\n100\nTime (sec)\ne 3\n(t)\n \nFig. 1      Fig. 2 \n \n The synchronization of chaotic systems subject to parameter uncertainties using timed-delayed \nfuzzy state-feedback controller has been investigated.  The fuzzy state-feedback controller using the \nsystem state of the response chaotic system and the time-delayed system state of the drive chaotic system \nhas been proposed to realize the synchronization.  To overcome the analysis difficulties introduced by the \nsystem time delay and parameter uncertainties, first, T-S fuzzy has been employed to represent the \nchaotic systems subject to parameter uncertainties.  Then, the membership functions of both fuzzy model \nand fuzzy controller have been considered to facilitate the stability analysis and produce less conservative \nstability analysis result.  LMI-based stability conditions have been derived using Lyapunov-based \napproach to guarantee the system stability and aid the design of the time-delayed fuzzy controller.  A \nsimulation example has been given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. \n \nREFERENCES \n[1] T. Takagi and M.
