Introduction \nStudies of the effects of laser wavelength variation for medical and surgical applications are \nnumerous [1-7], and have shown clear differences in the performance and effectiveness of \nmany different lasers for such applications. Comparisons of the differences in the beam \ninteraction characteristics with various materials of the predominant materials processing \nlasers, the CO2, the Nd:YAG and the excimer laser, are limited. Previously Dausinger [8] \ncompared CO, CO2 and Nd:YAG lasers for a number of materials processing applications, \nnoting the main fundamental differences resulting from wavelength variations. From work \nusing CO2 and excimer lasers to examine the effect of laser wavelength on the ablation of soda-\nlime-silica glass, Shuttleworth [9] observed distinct differences in the performance of the lasers \nin terms of process effectiveness. Similarly, from work investigating alternative routes to the \nlaser ablation-deposition (LAD) of Al2O3 and Ti:saphire using CO2 and excimer radiation, Dyer \net al [10] found that laser wavelength was a major influence in determining the likelihood of \nsuccessful deposition. A study conducted by Chen et al [11] using Nd:YAG and excimer lasers \nfound that the quality of laser drilled holes was significantly influenced by laser wavelength.  \nLikewise such practical comparisons between these traditional materials processing lasers and \nthe more contemporary high power diode laser (HPDL) are even fewer in number. Previously \nSchmidt et al [12] compared the performance of CO2, excimer and HPDL in the removal of \nchlorinated rubber coatings from concrete surfaces, particularly in terms of removal rate. From \nthe work, wavelength dependant differences in process performance were observed. \nAdditionally, Bradley et al [13] compared the CO2 and HPDL for the treatment of Al2O3-based \nrefractory materials in terms of microstructure, observing wavelength dependant \nmicrostructural characteristics unique to each laser. \nThis paper reports on work conducted to determine the differences in the beam interaction \ncharacteristics of an Al2O3\/SiO2 based ceramic material and a commercially available vitreous \nenamel with a 1 kW CO2 laser, a 400 W Nd:YAG laser, a 5 W KrF excimer laser and a                \n60 W-cw HPDL, with particular emphasis on the laser effected modification of the wettability \ncharacteristics.  \nWetting is often the primary factor governing whether a coating will adhere and bond to a \nsubstrate in practical applications such as enamelling, painting, etc. In this present study the \nAl2O3\/SiO2 based ceramic used is a newly developed ceramic tile grout material (an \namalgamated oxide compound grout (AOCG)), which in practice is sealed by firing the enamel \n frit onto it using a HPDL, thus creating an impervious surface glaze [14-16]. As such, it is most \nimportant to understand the fundamental behaviour and the mechanisms involved in the laser \nfiring of the enamel on to the AOCG.  \nBoth scientists and engineers alike have a great interest in understanding the interfacial \nphenomena between vitreous enamels and ceramic materials, since in many practical \napplications where vitreous enamels are fired onto ceramic substrates, the performance of the \narticle is directly linked to the nature of the enamel-ceramic interface. At present, very little \nwork has been published with regard to the use of lasers for altering the surface properties of \nmaterials in order to improve their wettability characteristics. Notwithstanding this, it is \nrecognised within the currently published work that laser irradiation of material surfaces can \neffect its wettability characteristics. Previously Zhou et al [17, 18] have carried out work on \nlaser coating of aluminium alloys with ceramic materials (SiO2, Al2O3, etc.), reporting on the \nwell documented fact that generated oxide layers often promote metal\/oxide wetting. Bahners et \nal [19, 20], have observed and comprehensively detailed the changes in technical properties of \nvarious textile fibres, including adhesion and wetting properties, with a view to developing an \nalternative to the conventional methods of chemical agents addition or wet-chemical pre-\nprocessing. Also, Heitz et al [21] and Olfert et al [22] have found that excimer laser treatment \nof metals results in improved coating adhesion. The improvements in adhesion were ascribed to \nthe fact that the excimer laser treatment resulted in a smoother surface and as such enhanced \nthe action of wetting. However, the reasons for these changes with regard to changes in the \nmaterial\u2019s surface morphology, surface composition and surface energy are not reported. \nWork on HPDL modification of the wettability characteristics of a number of different ceramic \nmaterials [23] has shown that the wettability performance is affected by changes in the surface \nroughness, the surface O2 content and the surface energy. This paper reports specifically on the \ninteraction characteristics of the beams of all four lasers with the AOCG and the enamel in \nterms of resultant changes in the wettability characteristics. These incorporate chiefly: contact \nangle variations, the differences in morphological features, the surface composition, the \nmicrostructural changes and the surface energy changes. \n2. Experimental procedure \n2.1. Material preparation and application procedure \nThe ceramic material consisted of mixed vitrifiable oxide powders such as chamotte (mainly \nSiO2 (53wt%) and Al2O3 (42wt%)), Fe2O3, MgO, ZrO2 and ZnO was produced. The oxide \npowders were sieved to ensure a particle size of less than 75\u00b5m, then thoroughly mixed \n together to ensure homogeneity, along with approximately 50wt% diluted sodium silicate \nsolution so as to form a manageable paste. The AOCG was then pasted on to an ordinary \nPortland cement (OPC) substrate to a thickness of 2mm and allowed to cure at room \ntemperature for 12 hours. The composition of the enamel consisted mainly of the following; \nSiO2, B2O3, Na2O, Mn, F and small quantities of Ba, Al2O3 and Ni, whilst the powder size was \nless than 75\u00b5m. The enamel frit paste was allowed to cure at room temperature for one to two \nhours and then irradiated immediately with the HPDL beam. \n2.2. Laser processing procedures \nFigure 1 schematically illustrates the general laser processing experimental arrangement, where \nthe defocused beams of the lasers were fired back and forth across the surfaces of the AOCG by \ntraversing the samples beneath the laser beam using the x- and y-axis of the CNC gantry table. \nThe general operating characteristics of the lasers used in the study are detailed in Table1. Both \npulsed and CW lasers were used in the study, therefore, both the average power and the peak \npower of each laser will differ. So, in order to reasonably compare the effects of each laser on \nthe wettability characteristics of the AOCG, the laser energy density (fluence) of each laser \nbeam incident on the AOCG surface was set by manipulating the laser power densities and \ntraverse speeds such that the energy density of each of the four lasers incident upon the AOCG \nsurface was around 165 J\/cm2. \n2.3. Contact angle and surface energy analysis procedure \nTo investigate the effects of laser radiation on the wetting and surface energy characteristics of \nthe AOCG, two sets of wetting experiments were conducted. The first set of experiments were \nto simply determine the contact angle between the enamel and the AOCG before and after \ninteraction with the selected industrial lasers. The second set of experiments were control \nexperiments carried out using the sessile drop technique with a variety of test liquids with \nknown surface energy properties in order to quantify any surface energy changes in the AOCG \nresulting from laser interaction. \nThe enamel-AOCG wetting experiments were carried out in atmospheric conditions with \nmolten droplets of the enamel (6000C). The temperature of the enamel throughout the \nexperiments was measured using a Cyclops infrared pyrometer. The droplets were released in a \ncontrolled manner onto the surface of the AOCG (laser treated and untreated) from the tip of a \nmicropipette, with the resultant volume of the drops being approximately 15 x 10-3 cm3. Profile \nphotographs of the sessile enamel drop were obtained for every 600C fall in temperature of the \nmolten enamel drop, with the contact angle subsequently being measured, and a mean value \nbeing obtained.  \n The sessile drop control experiments were carried out, using human blood, human blood \nplasma, glycerol and 4-octanol. The test liquids, along with their total surface energy ( \u03b3 2 ), \ndispersive (\u03b3 lv\nd\n) and polar (\u03b3 lv\np\n) component values are detailed in Table 2. The experiments \nwere conducted in atmospheric conditions at a temperature of 200C. The droplets were released \nin a controlled manner onto the surface of the test substrate materials (laser treated and \nuntreated) from the tip of a micropipette, with the resultant volume of the drops being \napproximately 6 x 10-3 cm3. Each experiment lasted for three minutes with profile photographs \nof the sessile drops being obtained every minute. The contact angles were then subsequently \nmeasured. A mean value was subsequently determined.  \nIt was observed during the wetting experiments conducted with both the enamel and the control \nliquids that, throughout the period of the experiments, no discernible change in the magnitude \nof the contact angle was observed, indicating that thermodynamic equilibrium was established \nat the solid-liquid interface at the outset of the experiments. This is perhaps surprising when \none considers the temperature effect on surface tension as described by Mayers [25]. However, \nresults similar to those observed in this study have been described by Agathopoulos et al [26]. \n3. Effects of laser radiation on contact angle characteristics \nPrior to laser treatment of the AOCG surface it was not possible to fire the enamel onto the \nsurface of the AOCG. This was found to be due to the fact that the contact angle between the \nenamel and the untreated AOCG surface was measured as being 1180, consequently preventing \nthe enamel from wetting the AOCG surface.  \nUnder the experimental laser parameters, interaction with the CO2 laser, the Nd:YAG laser and \nthe HPDL beams resulted in the contact angle between the enamel and the AOCG reducing \nfrom 1180 to 310, 340 and 330 respectively. In contrast, interaction of the AOCG with excimer \nlaser radiation effected an increase in the contact angle to 1210.  \nSimilarly, as Table 3 shows, with all the control liquids used the AOCG experienced a \nsignificant reduction in contact angle as a result of interaction with the CO2 laser, the Nd:YAG \nlaser and the HPDL beams, whilst interaction with the excimer laser beam again resulted in an \nincrease in the contact angle. \n \n \n \n 3.1. Variations in surface roughness characteristics \nAccording to Neumann [27, 28], a model similar to that for heterogeneous solid surfaces can be \ndeveloped in order to account for surface irregularities, being given by a rearrangement of \nWenzel\u2019s equation: \n \u03b3 \u03b3\n\u03b3 \u03b8\nsl sv\nlv w\nr\n= \u2212\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f7\ncos\n (1) \nwhere, r is the roughness factor defined as the ratio of the real and apparent surface areas and \n\u03b8w is the contact angle for the wetting of a rough surface. Equation (1) shows clearly that if the \nroughness factor, r, is large, that is the solid surface is smooth, then \u03b3sl will become small, thus, \na reduction in the contact angle will be inherently realised by the liquid if \u03b8<900. In contrast, if \n\u03b8>900 then the opposite will be observed. \nIndeed, considerable reductions in the surface roughness of the AOCG were observed after \ninteraction with the CO2 laser, the Nd:YAG laser and the HPDL beams, reducing from an initial \nRa value of 25.85\u00b5m to 5.88\u00b5m, 6.56\u00b5m and 6.27\u00b5m respectively. In contrast, interaction of \nthe AOCG with excimer laser radiation resulted in a roughening of the AOCG surface, causing \nthe surface roughness to increase to an Ra value of 36.22\u00b5m. \nThe smoothing effects of CO2 laser, Nd:YAG laser and HPDL irradiation on the surface of the \nAOCG in comparison with the roughening effects of excimer laser irradiation are clearly \ndiscernible from Figure 2. \n3.2. Variations in surface oxygen content \nThe O2 content of a material\u2019s surface is most certainly an influential factor effecting the \nwetting performance of the material [29, 30]. Wetting is governed by the first atomic layers of \nthe surface of a material. Thus, in order to determine element content of O2 at the surface of the \nAOCG, it was necessary to examine the surface using x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS). \nSignificant differences in the surface O2 content of the AOCG after interaction with all the \nselected lasers were observed. Increases in the surface O2 content were experienced by the \nAOCG after interaction with CO2 laser, the Nd:YAG laser and the HPDL beams, increasing \nfrom an initial value of 37.6at.% to 43.1at.%, 41.4at.% and 42.8at.% respectively. Conversely, \ninteraction of the AOCG with excimer laser radiation resulted in the surface O2 content of the \nAOCG decreasing slightly to 33.4at.%. \n \n 4. Surface energy and the dispersive\/polar characteristics \nThe intermolecular attraction which is responsible for surface energy, \u03b3, results from a variety \nof intermolecular forces whose contribution to the total surface energy is additive [31]. The \nmajority of these forces are functions of the particular chemical nature of a certain material, and \nas such the total surface energy comprises of \u03b3p (polar or non-dispersive interaction) and \u03b3d \n(dispersive component; since van der Waals forces are present in all systems regardless of their \nchemical nature). Therefore, the surface energy of any system can be described by [31] \n \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3= +d p  (2) \nSimilarly, Wad can be expressed as the sum of the different intermolecular forces that act at the \ninterface [31]: \n ( ) ( )W W Wad add adp svd lvd svp lvp= + = +2 2\n1 2 1 2\n\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3\n\/ \/\n (3) \nBy equating Equation (3) with the Young-Dupre Equation: \n ( )Wad lv= +\u03b3 \u03b81 cos  (4) \nThen the contact angle for solid-liquid systems can be related to the surface energies of the \nrespective liquid and solid by \n   \n( ) ( )\ncos\n\/ \/\n\u03b8\n\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3\n\u03b3\n=\n+\n\u2212\n2 2\n1\n1 2 1 2\nsv\nd\nlv\nd\nsv\np\nlv\np\nlv\n (5) \nIn accordance with studies conducted by Fowkes [31] and Agathopoulos [26], it is possible to \nestimate reasonably accurately the dispersive component of the AOCG surface energy, \u03b3 sv\nd\n, by \nplotting the graph of cos \u03b8 against (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)1\/2\/\u03b3lv in accordance with Equation (5) [31], with the \nvalue of \u03b3 sv\nd\n being estimated by the gradient (=2(\u03b3 sv\nd\n)1\/2) of the line which connects the origin \n(cos \u03b8 = -1) with the intercept point of the straight line (cos \u03b8 against (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)1\/2\/\u03b3lv) correlating the \ndata point with the abscissa at cos \u03b8 = 1. Figure 3 shows the best-fit plot of cos \u03b8 against \n(\u03b3 lv\nd\n)1\/2\/\u03b3lv for the untreated and laser treated AOCG-experimental control liquids system.  \nA comparison of the ordinate intercept points of the untreated and laser treated AOCG-liquid \nsystems, shown in Figure 3, shows clearly that for the untreated and excimer laser treated \nAOCG-liquid systems, the best-fit straight line intercepts the ordinate relatively close to the \n origin. In contrast, Figure 3 shows that the best-fit straight line for the AOCG-liquid systems of \nthe CO2, Nd:YAG and HPDL treated samples intercept the ordinate considerably higher above \nthe origin. This is of great importance since interception of the ordinate close to the origin is \ncharacteristic of the dominance of dispersion forces acting at the AOCG-liquid interfaces of the \nuntreated and excimer laser treated samples, resulting in poor adhesion [31, 32]. While an \ninterception of the ordinate well above the origin is indicative of the action of polar forces \nacross the interface, in addition to dispersion forces, hence improved wettability and adhesion \nis promoted [31, 32]. Furthermore, because none of the best-fit straight lines intercept below \nthe origin, then it can be said that the development of an equilibrium film pressure of adsorbed \nvapour on the AOCG surface (untreated and laser treated) did not occur [31, 32]. \nAgain, in accordance with studies conducted by Fowkes [31] and Agathopoulos [26], it is not \npossible to determine the value of the polar component of the AOCG surface energy,\u03b3 sv\np\n, \ndirectly from Figure 3. This is because the intercept of the straight line (cos \u03b8 against \n(\u03b3 lv\nd\n)1\/2\/\u03b3lv) is at ( )2 1 2\u03b3 \u03b3svp lvp\n\/\n\/\u03b3lv, and thus only refers to individual control liquids and not the \ncontrol liquid system as a whole. However, it has been established that the entire amount of the \nsurface energies due to dispersion forces either of the solids or the liquids are active in the \nwettability performance [31, 33]. As such, it is possible to calculate the dispersive component \nof the work of adhesion, Wad\nd\n,  using only the relevant part of equation (3) thus \n ( )Wadd svd lvd= 2\n1 2\n\u03b3 \u03b3\n\/\n (6) \nThe results reveal that for each particular control liquid in contact with both the untreated and \nlaser treated AOCG surfaces, bothWad  and Wad\nd\n are related by the straight line relationship \n  W aW bad ad\nd= +  (7) \nwhere a and b are constants unique to each control liquid system. Also, for the control test \nliquids used, a linear relationship between the dispersive and polar components of the control \ntest liquids surface energies has been deduced which satisfies the equation \n  ( ) ( )\u03b3 \u03b3lvp lvd\n1 2 1 2\n13 115\n\/ \/\n. .= +  (8) \nBy introducing Equation (7) into Equation (3) and rearranging, then \n  ( )W a W badp add= \u2212 +1  (9) \n By combining Equation (9) with Equation (3) and differentiating with respect to ( )\u03b3 lvd\n1 2\/\n, then \nthe following can be derived: \n  ( ) ( )\n( )\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\nsv\np sv\nd a1 2\n1 2\n1\n13\n\/\n\/\n.\n=\n\u2212\n (10) \nThus, from the best-fit straight line plots of Wad  against Wad\nd\n for the AOCG when it is both \nuntreated and laser treated, it is possible to determine the constants a and b for each separate \ncondition of the AOCG, as shown in Table 4. Since \u03b3 sv\nd\n has already been determined for the \nuntreated and laser treated AOCG from Figure 3, then it is possible to calculate \u03b3 sv\np\n for \nuntreated and laser treated AOCG using Equation (10). \nAs one can see from Table 5, CO2 laser, Nd:YAG laser and HPDL treatment of the surface of \nthe AOCG result in an overall increase in the total surface energy \u03b3sv, whilst significantly \nincreasing also the polar component of the surface energy \u03b3 sv\np\n. Such increases in the surface \nenergy of the AOCG, in particular the increase in \u03b3 sv\np\n, have a positive effect upon the action of \nwetting and adhesion. Again, these changes in the surface energy of the AOCG after treatment \nwith these lasers is primarily due to the fact that the treatment of the AOCG surface results in \nthe melting and partial vitrification of the surface; a transition that is known to effect an \nincrease in \u03b3 sv\np\n [26], consequently causing a decrease in the contact angle. \n5. Discussion of laser effected wettability characteristics modification \nThe results detailed previously show clearly that interaction of the AOCG with selected \nindustrial lasers has resulted in the contact angle formed between the enamel and the control \nliquids altering to various degrees depending upon the laser type. Under the selected \nexperimental laser operating parameters, interaction of the AOCG typically with the CO2 laser, \nthe Nd:YAG laser and the HPDL beams resulted in decrease of similar proportion in the \ncontact angle, whilst interaction of the AOCG with excimer laser radiation resulted in an \nincrease in the contact angle. Such changes in the value of the contact angle are influenced, \ndepending upon the laser used, primarily by:  \n1. Surface Melting and Partial Vitrification - Laser induced melting and vitrification \nresults in the occurrence of two main changes in the surface condition of the AOCG. \nThese are: \n i. Surface Smoothing resulting from the laser melting of the AOCG surface which \nconsequently results in a reduction of the surface roughness, thus directly \nreducing the contact angle, \u03b8. \nii. Increase in the Polar Component,\u03b3 sv\np\n, of the Surface Energy resulting from the \nmelting and partial laser vitrification of the glass forming elements within the \nAOCG composition, thus improving the action of wetting and adhesion by \ngenerating a surface with a more vitreous surface microstructure. \n2. Surface Roughening - An increase in the AOCG surface roughness resulting from \nlaser ablation of the AOCG surface in turn results directly in an increase in the \ncontact angle, \u03b8. \n3. Surface O2 Content - An increase in the surface O2 content of the AOCG resulting \nfrom laser treatment is an influential factor in the promotion of the action of wetting, \nsince an increase in surface O2 content  inherently effects a decrease in the contact \nangle, and vice versa. \nIt is highly likely that the resultant contact angle between the AOCG-enamel and the AOCG-\nliquid systems of the CO2, Nd:YAG and the HPDL treated samples are all similar in value due \nto the fact that interaction with these lasers caused surface melting (see Figure 2), resulting in a \nsignificantly smoother surface. This, combined with the fact that vitrification of the AOCG \nsurface results in an increase in the polar component of the surface energy, \u03b3 sv\np\n, as a result of \nthe surface becoming less crystalline in nature, thus promoting wetting, would influence a \nreduction in the contact angle. From Table 5 it can be seen that interaction of the AOCG with \nCO2, Nd:YAG and the HPDL radiation resulted in similar increases in \u03b3 sv\np\n. However, \nabsorption of CO2 radiation by the AOCG is higher than that of the Nd:YAG or the HPDL [34], \nand, since contact angle reduction is a function of surface melting and vitrification [34], then \nsurface melting and vitrification will occur to a greater extent with the CO2 laser, thus resulting \nin a marginally greater decrease in the contact angle.  \nIn contrast, as Figure 2(e) shows, interaction of the AOCG with excimer laser radiation did not \ncause melting of the surface, but instead induced surface ablation which consequently resulted \nin a slightly rougher surface. Thus an increase in the contact angle was effected. Additionally, \nKokai et al [35] have concluded that, with excimer laser parameters which are conducive to the \nproduction of plasma, as was the case with the AOCG, then the surface roughness is increased \nas a result of plasma induced debris redepositing on the surface and excessive thermally \ninduced surface fractures and porosities. Clearly, since plasma generation was observed, then \nsurface roughening after excimer laser irradiation was perhaps to be expected. However, both \n Liu et al [36] and Nicolas et al [37] have reported that irradiating ZrO2 with excimer laser \nradiation with energy densities in excess of 2.7 J\/cm2, resulted in a reduction in surface \nroughness. Such reductions were attributed to the fact that at these levels of energy density, \nmelting of the ZrO2 surface occurred.  \nIt was found that the depth of the laser melting, and in the case of the excimer laser, the \nablation region, varied significantly according to laser type. Table 6 shows the differences in \nlaser melt\/ablation depth determined for each laser by means of cross-sectional SEM analysis. \nAs Table 6 shows, the differences in laser melt\/ablation depth obtained with the Nd:YAG and \nexcimer lasers was an order of magnitude smaller than those of the CO2 laser or HPDL. The \nmain reason for these large differences are thought to be due to the pulsed nature of the beams \nof the Nd:YAG and excimer lasers, as opposed to the CW nature of the CO2 laser or HPDL \nbeams. Since the interaction time of a pulsed beam with a material is much shorter than that of \na CW beam, then consequently the depth of the laser melt\/ablation region will be much smaller \ndue to the reduced time afforded for heat transfer. \nIt is also of great importance to consider the surface O2 content of the AOCG before and after \ntreatment with the selected lasers. Increases in the surface O2 content were experienced by the \nAOCG after interaction with CO2 laser, the Nd:YAG laser and the HPDL beams, whilst \ninteraction of the AOCG with excimer laser radiation resulted in the surface O2 content of the \nAOCG decreasing. Such a result is in agreement with the findings of a number of workers [38, \n39], who have noted that for many ceramic materials, irradiation with an excimer laser beam \ncreates defective energy levels, in particular the formation of O2 vacancies.     \nSince roughening of the surface does not necessarily create a surface with a more crystalline \nstructure, then it is reasonable to assume that the increase in the surface roughness after \nexcimer laser irradiation, along with the associated reduction on the surface O2 content, are the \nprincipal reasons for the observed decrease in the contact angle.  \n6. Conclusion \nInteraction of CO2, Nd:YAG, excimer and high power diode laser (HPDL) radiation with the \nsurface of the AOCG was found to effect significant changes in the wettability characteristics \nof the material. It was observed that interaction with CO2, Nd:YAG and HPDL radiation \nreduced the enamel contact angle from 1180 to 310, 340 and 330 respectively. In contrast, \ninteraction with excimer laser radiation resulted an increase in the contact angle to 1210. Such \nchanges were identified as being primarily due to: (i) the melting and partial vitrification of the \nAOCG surface as a result of interaction with CO2, Nd:YAG HPDL radiation. This in turn \ngenerated a smoother surface and increased the polar component of the AOCG surface energy. \n (ii) the surface roughness of the AOCG increasing after interaction with excimer laser radiation \ndue to ablation of the surface which in turn resulted directly in an increase in the contact angle. \n(iii) the surface O2 content of the AOCG increasing after interaction with CO2, Nd:YAG and \nHPDL radiation due to surface melting. Whilst conversely, the surface O2 content of the AOCG \ndecreased after interaction with the excimer laser due to the creation of defective energy levels. \nA wavelength dependance of the change of the wetting properties can not be deduced from the \nfindings of this work. This is apparent from the very similar properties of the surfaces irradiated \nwith the CO2 laser, the Nd:YAG laser and the HPDL, the wavelengths of which vary by more \nthan an order of magnitude. Nonetheless, the work has shown that under the chosen \nexperimental laser operating parameters, changes in the wettability characteristics of the AOCG \nwere seen to vary depending upon the laser type. In particular, whether the laser radiation had \nthe propensity to cause surface melting. Similar effects of laser surface treatment have been \nobserved for other ceramic materials when treated with a HPDL [23]. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n References \n1.
