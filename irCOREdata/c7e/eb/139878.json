This paper provides observations on the erosion\ndamage of EB PVD TBCs and discusses the type of damage caused by erosion as well as proposing a possible\nmechanism of erosion. The aim of the project as a whole was to model the erosion of EB PVD TBCs, but before\nmodelling could begin it was necessary to determine the erosion mechanism of these coatings.\nIt was found that in all cases examined the erosion of the coatings proceeds through the accumulation of damage in\nthe form of horizontal cracks in the columns of the coating and subsequent removal of the fractured sections. Since\nit appears as though the contact radius is important in the erosion process, the affect of varying the elastic\nproperties of the erodent and the target on the contact radius was assessed.\nKeywords: Erosion mechanisms, Thermal Barrier Coatings\nIntroduction\nSince the advent of thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) more than three decades ago they have received a lot of\nattention with their promise of higher operating temperatures and more efficient turbine engines. However, most of\n2the research carried out in the field of TBCs has concentrated on the thermal cyclic life of the coatings [1-4], the\nprocessing of the coatings [5-7] or the thermal conductivity of the coatings [8,9]. This is quite understandable since\nspalling due to oxide growth at the bond coat TBC interface and thermal stresses associated with engine operating\ncycles were the primary cause of failure in the early days of TBCs. However, with the introduction of electron\nbeam (EB) physical vapour deposition (PVD) TBCs and their application to moving components in the hot gas\nstream erosion has become a prime concern. EB PVD TBCs, due to their unique columnar microstructure are far\nmore strain tolerant than their plasma sprayed (PS) counter parts and can thus be used under more exacting\noperating conditions. It is under these operating conditions that erosion of the coated components is of primary\nimportance. With blade tip velocities approaching mach 1 the impact of small-ingested particles can cause\nsignificant damage to the coatings. Thus more recently some researchers have studied the erosion of both PS and\nEB PVD TBCs [10-12].\nThese papers generally report the erosion rates of various TBCs under a range of erosion conditions in some cases\ngiving results as normalised erosion rates. But generally there is very little information on the actual erosion\nmechanism except in recent papers by Nicholls et al [11,13].\nThe primary aim of this study was to formulate a computer model that would predict the erosion rate of EB PVD\nTBCs in order to provide design engineers with a usable tool for predicting component life. But before a computer\nprogram can be written the erosion mechanism of the system to be modelled must be fully understood. Thus, the\nfirst stage of this project has been involved in determining the erosion mechanism of EB PVD TBCs, the findings\nof which are outlined in this paper.\nIt is perhaps necessary at this stage to mention the difference between foreign object damage (FOD) and erosion.\nAlthough FOD is strictly speaking still erosion, more and more it is falling under its own classification, the\nmechanisms of material removal are vastly different and as such need to be differentiated. Microstructurally, the\ndifference between the two are really quite straight forward; in FOD there is gross deformation of the TBC with the\nformation of a crater and the bending and cracking of a number of columns on a single impact [13]. Whereas with\nerosion there is much less large-scale mechanical damage and plastic deformation is confined to the top of the\n3columnar microstructure. Cracking of the TBC and an accumulation of damage are necessary before material is\nremoved and there is no gross deformation of the coating.\nUnfortunately due to the unique columnar microstructure of the EB PVD TBCs the classical brittle erosion\nmechanisms proposed by Lawn et al and Tilly [14-17], with which all are familiar, can not be used in modelling the\nerosion of EB PVD TBCs. This meant that a thorough investigation into the erosion mechanism of the coatings\nwas necessary before it would be possible to write a computer program to predict material wastage.\nErosion of TBCs\nOf the papers on the erosion of TBCs only a few comment on the actual erosion mechanism as opposed to merely\nreporting the measured erosion rates under various conditions. Previous studies of brittle erosion have shown that\nmaterial removal occurs via the formation, propagation and intersection of cracks with other crack and the surface.\nHowever, in EB PVD TBCs due to the columnar microstructure the cracks formed during erosion neither intersects\nwith each other or indeed the surface. Which, as stated earlier, means that established erosion mechanisms can not\nbe used to model the erosion of EB PVD TBCs. The erosion of these coatings appears to be via the formation of\ncracks in the columns and subsequent removal of the section of the material above the cracks. It has been noted in\nthe literature that on particle impact the cracks propagate through the columns perpendicular to the direction of\ncolumn growth and that under most conditions the coatings exhibit a brittle type of response to erosion.\nHowever, Nicholls et al [11] noted that at high temperatures, temperatures above the softening point of the erodent,\nthe coatings exhibited a ductile response to erosion. Maximum erosion rate was observed at 30\u00b0 impact with the\nrates at 90\u00b0 less than that at room temperature. This pseudo-ductile response was attributed to the softening of the\nerodent, silica, which appears to facilitate the removal of fractured section at low impact angles. This trend was not\nobserved when eroding with alumina.\n4The Microstructure of EB PVD TBCs\nThe importance of EB PVD TBCs lies in their far greater ability to accommodate strain than their PS counterparts\nwhich is due to their columnar microstructure. Thus EB PVD TBCs are gaining increased prominence in strain\ncritical applications over their PS counter parts even though the later is a more mature process and widely used.\nWhen discussing the effect of microstructure on erosion rate for most engineering materials grain size is an\nimportant factor. This is especially significant for brittle materials and dual phase materials.\nWhen dealing with TBCs one has to consider two very distinctive and very different microstructures, which can not\nbe treated in the same way as conventional engineering materials or indeed in the same way as each other. The\nvery nature of the microstructure of these two processes necessitates the definition of two new erosion mechanisms.\nOr at the very least major modifications to classical erosion mechanisms. The following two micrographs indicate\nthe difference in microstructure of EB PVD and PS TBCs.\nIt is the columnar microstructure of the EB PVD coatings, which gives them their high strain tolerance due to the\nfact that under mechanical load or thermal cycling the ceramic columns can move thus accommodating the strain\n[18]. This option is not available to the PS coatings, although research effort is focused on microcracking the splat\nnetwork to improve the degree of strain tolerance.\nSince the microstructure of a material has a great influence on the erosion rate and mechanism one must have a\ngood understanding of the microstructure before attempting to determine an erosion mechanism. Most authors\nadequately describe the microstructure of EB PVD TBCs as a tapered columnar structure due to the three\ndimensional growth which can result in inhibiting the growth of neighbouring columns.\nThe above description only adequately describes the structure of the coatings on a macroscopic level, but what of\nthe structure of the columns themselves? Are they single grains or a number of grains, is there directionality in the\n5column and what degree of porosity is there? These are all important factors which can affect both the erosion rate\nand the mechanism.\nOn examining back scattered SEM micrographs of the cross section of EB PVD TBCs it becomes apparent that\nthere are three microstructural features of the columns in the EB PVD coatings which could be important. The\nmost obvious and the easiest to see is the fern leaf dendritic type structure on the edge of the columns which appear\nto indicate a 45\u00b0 growth angle of the columns. These are probably related to the mobility of the atoms on\ncondensation onto the column and appear to be similar to solidification dendrites, but are formed directly from the\nvapour phase. The second feature, which is not immediately apparent, is the concentric striations fanning\nhorizontally across the individual columns. These are due to the rotation of the sample during the coating process,\nwith the thickness of the bands being directly related to the rotation speed and local vapour deposition rate. The\nthird feature, which is very difficult to see, is that the columns of the coating are made up of numerous smaller\ncolumnar crystallites, which are extremely closely packed. This feature is more easily visible when looking at the\ntop surface of a coating.\nOther factors which are likely to affect the erosion rate of EB PVD TBCs are the size of the columns and the\norientation of the columns with respect to the substrate. However, these issues will not be discussed in this paper,\nbut are to be examined further in a future paper.\nExperimental Test Sample Preparation\nIn order to determine the erosion mechanism of the EB PVD TBCs eroded samples were sectioned, mounted in\nresin, polished and examined under the scanning electron microscope (SEM). The samples had all been eroded\nunder various impact conditions in the Cranfield erosion rig a description of which can be found in a previous\npublication by Nicholls et al [13]. The samples were all ZrO2-8wt% Y2O3 EB PVD TBCs and were eroded at room\ntemperature and 910\u00b0C using 60 \u00b5m silica and 100 \u00b5m alumina as the erodent at velocities between 140m\/s and\n300 m\/s. the coatings were all 200-300\u00b5m thick. The results of the erosion tests can also be found in the literature\n[11].\n6Results\nExamination of the eroded TBC samples showed that there was little visible plastic deformation and there were a\nnumber of cracked columns indicating a brittle type of erosion mechanism as was expected from what was\nobserved in the literature. A number of samples were examined under the SEM and micrographs taken at various\npoints in order to facilitate the measuring and counting of cracks in the columns.\nMost of the cracks were perpendicular to the direction of column growth, which implies that tensile stresses were\nresponsible for the initiation and propagation of the fracture rather than compressive stresses. It must be noted that\nthese types of cracks were not observed in regions of the coating, which had not been eroded, and are thus a direct\nresult of the erosion process. In nearly all cases the cracks propagated across the whole diameter of the column,\nfurthermore no indications were found of cracks propagating into neighbouring columns.\nThe micrographs were used to measure the width of the column at the point of fracture, the distance of the fracture\nfrom the top surface and, where possible, the distance from the bottom surface of the coating. Analysis of fracture\nsize and position in the coatings led to a number of pertinent observations being made:\n\uf0b7 There appears to be no correlation between the column diameter and the depth at which it fractures.\n\uf0b7 The cracks are all perpendicular to the direction of column growth.\n\uf0b7 The cracks appear not to propagate into neighbouring columns.\n\uf0b7 80% of fractures occurred in the top 20 \u00b5m of the coating.\n\uf0b7 Most of the fractured columns have only one fracture.\n\uf0b7 The number of adjacent columns with cracks never exceeds nine but in the majority of cases is five or less.\nThese observations allow a number of hypotheses to be proposed on the erosion mechanism of the EB PVD TBCs:\n7\uf0b7 Fracture depth is independent of column diameter, as can be seen from graph 5.\n\uf0b7 Cracking is caused by tensile rather than compressive stresses, evidenced by the lack of shear cracking in the\neroded coatings.\n\uf0b7 It is expected that by reducing column diameter the erosion resistance would increase, experimental work is\ncurrently underway to validate this hypothesis.\n\uf0b7 Under the experimental conditions used material removal is likely to occur after five adjacent columns have\nfractured, it is expected that this would change under different erosion conditions.\n\uf0b7 There is a degree of damage accumulation before material is removed.\nFrom this information one can perhaps propose an erosion mechanism which would be similar to the Radial\/Lateral\nmodel proposed by Lawn and Swain[16]. A fracture is produced in the column, a certain distance beneath the\nsurface impact region, which then propagates parallel to the surface of the coating until it reaches the edge of the\ncolumn in which it was initiated and can thus travel no further. Due to the complexity of the situation this problem\nis currently being analysed by the use of finite element modelling (FEM) and will be the subject of a paper in the\nnear future. It is hoped that the FEM will enable the depth of cracks to be predicted with a fair degree of accuracy\nas this is directly related to the erosion rate of the coatings.\nThe following graph shows the distribution of crack depth in a sample that has been eroded at 90\u00b0 impact at room\ntemperature with 100 \u00b5m rounded silica particles. An analysis of the distribution shows that it fits a lognormal\ntype. The cracks up to a depth of 30 \u00b5m are all considered to be due to particle impact while the origin of the\ncracks at the greater depths are not fully understood and are believed to be caused by other factors.\nApart from analysing the depth of the cracks, the number of adjacent columns with cracks at some depth was also\ndetermined. It was found that in the majority of cases no more than 5 columns in a row would be cracked.\n8Effect of Elastic Properties on the Contact Radius\nMost of the equations proposed in the literature to predict erosion rate make use of the material properties of both\nthe target and the erodent. Although these properties are available for the bulk materials they are not the same for\nthe coatings and the bulk values can only be used as guide lines in determining the properties of the coatings.\nFurther, FEM also requires the use of these properties. It was thus decided to determine how sensitive the size of\nthe Hertzian contact radius was to certain material properties under Hertzian contact conditions.\nThe problem of relating the contact forces to the momentum of impacting forces for spherical projectiles has\nalready been solved [19]. The solution gives the maximum force generated during impact between a projectile and\na planar surface as:\nWhere V, m and R are the velocity , mass and radius of the projectile and k1 and k2 are the constants relating to the\nelastic properties of the target and projectile.\nSince this equation also applies when limited plastic deformation occurs at the point of impact it can be used for\n\uf028 \uf029\uf028 \uf029\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf0291\n9\n16\n14.1max\n5\n1\n2\n21\n63\n2\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n\uf02b\n\uf03d\nkk\nRVm\nF \uf070\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf02921\n1\n2\n1\n1 E\nv\nk\n\uf070\n\uf02d\uf03d\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf02931\n2\n2\n2\n2 E\nv\nk\n\uf070\n\uf02d\uf03d\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029452.1max\n5\n1\n2\n21\n36\n2\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf02b\n\uf03d\nkk\nV\nRF\n\uf072\uf070\n9ceramic-ceramic impact problems. By inserting m = 4\/3\uf070R3\uf072 (where \uf072 is the particle density) the equation can be\nreduced to:\nThis equation was substituted in to the Hertz equation and the contact radius was calculated for various values of\nthe Poisson\u2019s ratio and Young\u2019s Modulus of the coating at various velocities and for different radii of the impacting\nparticles at various velocities.\nAs can be seen from the above 3 graphs it appears as though velocity and the radius of the impacting particle have\nthe greatest effect on the contact radius, which is to be expected. However, it also shows that relatively large\nvariations in the Poisson\u2019s ratio and Young\u2019s modulus of the target has a negligible effect on the contact radius.\nThis means that one can use the elastic properties of the bulk ceramic for modelling the erosion of the coatings. A\nsimilar effect was noted for variations in the Poisson\u2019s ratio and Young\u2019s modulus of the projectile.\nErosion Mechanisms of EB PVD TBCs\nDue to the columnar morphology of TBCs, Hertzian ring cracks and cone cracks are highly unlikely to occur and\nthe analysis of the samples shows no evidence of Hertzian type cracking.\nAfter studying the micrographs of the cross sections of eroded TBCs it became evident that there were a number of\ndifferent fracture mechanisms operating during the erosion of TBCs. The different mechanisms appear to operate\nin different regions of the coating and each of these shall be discussed separately.\nSHEAR CRACKING\nDuring all the analyses only one instance of shear cracking was observed and is mentioned here purely for the sake\nof completeness. The shear crack occurred on a sample that had been eroded at 910\u00b0 C with alumina. From the\nmicrograph one can see that a particle managed to form a wedge between two columns forcing them apart and\ninitiating a shear crack. Since this was the only case of shear cracking in all the samples examined it was felt that\n10\nthis was not a mechanism that would affect the erosion rate to any great extent and would not be taken into account\nin the erosion model.\nNEAR SURFACE CRACKING\nNear surface cracking is defined as cracking that occurs within the first 20 \u00b5m of the coating. This is the region,\nwhich accounts for the majority of the material removal during the erosion process. In this region there appears to\nbe two mechanisms operating one of which is similar to the median lateral mechanism. As can be seen from the\nfollowing micrograph the centre column shows evidence of classical median and lateral type cracking. One can\nassume that the impact centred on the middle of the column and it appears as though the median crack propagated\nalong a sub grain boundary. This is consistent with classical median crack formation during point loading.\nHowever, it must be noted that the majority of fractured columns show no evidence of median cracks. So what is\nthe mechanism of the other cracks in this region of the coating?\nThe question of inelastic deformation occurring in the TBC on impact is a difficult one to ascertain. Since the TBC\nhas an average density of approximately 50% of the theoretical density, inelastic deformation is most likely to take\nplace in the form of densification of the impacted column. It has not been possible yet to ascertain whether or not\nthis occurs. As an increase in density would increase the local hardness, nanoindentation could possibly be used to\ndetermine whether densification occurs, a route that is currently being investigated.\nIt is proposed that the cracks in the columns are produced during the unloading part of the impact cycle, due to\ntensile stresses produced beneath the region of inelastic (plastic) deformation on unloading.\nOn initial loading of the impacted column a region of inelastic deformation is formed (possibly densification), this\narea is surrounded by a region of elastic deformation. On unloading of the sample the region of elastic deformation\nis prevented from relaxing as a result of the constraint provided by the region of inelastic deformation. This results\nin a tensile stress beneath the point of indentation in the direction of column growth and can initiate cracks parallel\nto the surface.\n11\nIt is assumed that the depth at which cracking will occur is directly related to the force of the impacting particle and\nthe radius of the particle. Since these two factors will determine the size of the region of inelastic deformation they\nwill also determine the depth at which cracking will occur.\nDENDRITE INITIATED CRACKING\nDendrite initiated cracking typically occurs deeper that 20 \u00b5m into the coating and is initiated from the \u2018base\u2019 of the\ndendritic column edge structure, rather than from the centre of the column. What causes these cracks and exactly\nhow they are initiated has not yet been ascertained, but it is believed that the dendritic structure acts like a critical\ncircumferential notch in a given column.\nMATERIAL REMOVAL\nUp until now the discussion has been about the different mechanisms by which cracking occurs in TBCs due to\nsolid particle impact, now it is time to consider actual material removal. From the micrographs examined it is\nobvious that an accumulation of damage in the form of cracks is needed before material is removed. A single\nimpact on an EB PVD TBCs will not necessarily result in material removal even though it might have fractured the\ncolumn it impacted. This is attributed to the constraint of neighbouring columns \u2018holding\u2019 the fractured section in\nplace. Only once a number of adjacent columns have been fractured can a subsequent impact result in material\nremoval. When this does occur the fractured sections of a number of columns will be removed together.\nFrom the analyses of both cross sectioned samples and the eroded surface of samples it seems reasonable to\npropose that material removal occurs when one column and all its first order neighbours have been cracked this\nwould require removal from some seven columns simultaneously. This behaviour can be seen in figure 14.\nConclusions\nEB PVD TBCs crack under solid particle impact via a number of different mechanisms of which two appear to be\npredominant. These are:-\n\uf0b7 Near Surface Cracking (Modified Median Lateral cracking)\n12\n\uf0b7 Dendrite Initiated Cracking\nThe erosion of EB PVD TBCs proceeds via the accumulation of damage in a number of adjacent columns before\nmaterial is lost.\nFuture Work\nIt is quite possible that the diameter of the columns could affect the erosion rate of the TBCs with a reduction in\ncolumn diameter resulting in a reduction in wear rate. Since this will result in less material volume being removed\nper impact for smaller columns. A limit on this effect of column diameter is expected to exist. This limit will be\ndetermined by the column diameter at which one particle impact causes damage to more than one column.\nThere are four main sections of work, which need to be pursued for the continuation of this project:\n1. The determination of the extent of plastic deformation occurring on impact of the TBC. This can possibly be\nachieved through the use of nanohardness tests.\n2. The determination of crack depth on impact through the use of FEM.\n3. Bringing all the information together in the form of a computer programme that can predict the erosion rate of\nEB PVD TBCs under various conditions.\n4. Determine the effect of column diameter on the erosion rate of EB PVD TBCs.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors wish to thank EPSRC for their financial support of this work, under the RoPA award scheme.\n13\nThanks are also due to Mr Ken Lawson, Manager of Coating Services at Cranfield University, for the discussions\non the vapour deposition process and its influence on the morphology of EB PVD coatings.\nReference List\n1 T.A Cruse, S.E Stewart, and M Ortiz.
