Introduction \nPrimarily because of their superb mechanical, chemical and physical characteristics, glazed ceramic \ntiles command an extremely broad applications base. Ceramic tiles are typically applied to walls and \nfloors using either tile grouts or adhesive, with tile grout (typically epoxy based) or silicon resin \nbeing used to fill the void between adjoining tiles. The most intractable problem associated with tiled \nsurfaces is that contaminants can enter into, and exit a space via a tiled surface, through the tile \ngrouts used to fill the void between adjoining tiles [1]. In addition, commercially available tile grouts \nare extremely difficult to clean and over time they consequently become contaminated and have to be \nremoved physically or mechanically. In view of these inherent problems, however, only a moderate \namount of research has been conducted in an attempt to ameliorate these attendant problems. Even \nfewer studies have been carried out to investigate the possibility of using lasers to provide a solution. \nLawrence et al. [2-4] have exclusively pioneered the use of the high power diode laser (HPDL) to \ndevise a two- stage ceramic tile grout sealing process. The process uses a new grout material which \ncomprises of two distinct components: an amalgamated oxide compound grout (AOCG) substrate and \na glazed enamel surface. The HPDL two-stage ceramic tile grout sealing technique was shown to \nyield seals that exhibited no discernible cracks or porosities. An examination of the mechanical, \nchemical and physical characteristics of the seals showed that the generation of the enamel surface \nglaze resulted in a seal with improved mechanical and chemical properties over those of conventional \nepoxy tile grouts. \nOn the other hand, much work has previously been carried to investigate the sealing of engineering \nceramic surfaces using lasers. The remelting of ZrO2-based protective ceramic layers using a CO2 \nlaser [5] was shown to result in a marked decrease the level of structural defects. Further, the CO2 \nlaser remelting of a number of oxide ceramic coatings has been found to effect significant \nimprovements in corrosion resistance [6], whilst the CO2 laser remelting of Al2O3 and Al2O3-TiO2 \ncoatings yielded an increase in hardness and wear resistance [7]. The remelting of ZrO2-based \nprotective ceramic layers plasma sprayed onto a variety of bond coats using continuous wave (CW) \nand pulsed CO2 lasers [8, 9] revealed that the pulsed laser produced less cracking. The laser melting \nof plasma sprayed ceramic coatings based on Al2O3, TiO2 and ZrO2 using CW and pulsed CO2 lasers \n[10] revealed that the extent of cracking was a function of the total energy input to the surface and the \nthermophysical properties of the ceramic coatings. It was therefore concluded that to avoid cracking \nin such materials when remelting using the CO2 laser, it was essential to pre-heat the workpieces to \naround 800\n0\nC and thereby reduce the thermal gradient [10]. Similarly, the CO2 laser treatment of \nAl2O3 ZrO2 and TiC [11-13] cladded layers on a variety of alloys has been shown to be a viable \ntechnique. What is more, Bourban et al. [14] found that the quality of CO2 laser treated Al2O3-ZrO2 \ncladded layers on mild steel was highly dependant on the thickness of the clad layer itself. The \n 4 \nsurface modification ceramics with other industrial lasers besides the CO2 laser has proved \nsuccessful. After excimer laser treatment of the surface of Al2O3, Cappelli et al. [15] noted changes in \nthe surface chemistry and morphology of the material, whilst Wu et al. [16] found that excimer laser \ntreatment of Al2O3-SiC occasioned surface smoothing and an increase in the toughness of the \nmaterial. The surface glazing of mullite with a HPDL by Schmidt and Li [17] resulted in a glaze that \nexhibited good adherence to the bulk ceramic but was severely cracked. The firing of vitreous enamel \nfrits onto steel substrates using CW CO2 laser irradiation has proved successful [18, 19]. In both \nstudies, however, pre-heating in a furnace of the steel substrate to 200\n0\nC was necessary in order to \navoid microcracking. The firing of vitreous enamel frits onto glass substrates using CO2 lasers has \nalso been studied [20]. Owing to the localised heating nature of laser radiation, temperatures in \nexcess of 1000\n0\nC could be achieved without causing any deformation of the substrate glass. As such, \nit proved possible to fire PbO-free enamel frits [21]. Moreover, the gloss and the smoothness of the \nlaser fired enamel were comparable to those of conventional furnace fired enamels. However, in both \nstudies, pre- and post-heating of the enamels in a furnace to temperatures in the range of the enamel \nmelting temperature was necessary in order to relieve thermal stresses. \nThis paper presents a new technique whereby ceramic tiles are sealed together using a HPDL without \nthe need for pre-heating or special atmospheric conditions. The seals generated between adjoining \nvitrified ceramic tiles described in this paper were found to be tough and inexpensive, as well as \nproviding an amorphous, crack-free surface glaze. In this way the tiles were sealed together \npermanently, preventing any further contamination activity. Because such a seal would be an integral \na part of the surface as the tiles themselves, the requirement to remove old or contaminated grout \nfrom the void between the tiles would be eliminated. In addition, this paper reports on the \ndevelopment of a hand-held HPDL beam delivery unit and the related procedures necessary to lead to \nthe commercialisation of the single-stage ceramic tile grout sealing process. Along with this are \nincluded an appraisal of the potential hazards associated with the use of the HPDL in an industrial \nenvironment and the solutions implemented to ensure that the system complies with the relevant \nsafety standards. \n2. Single-stage tile grout material development \nCommercially available epoxy tile grout is currently formulated from four main components: acrylic \nemulsion; limestone; dolomite and a cellulose substance. The limestone and dolomite act as fillers \nand the cellulose substance is added basically to thicken the grout. It is well established that glazing \ncan only be achieved using materials containing at least some of the essential glass network forming \ncompounds such as SiO2 and BO3, along with some glass network modifying and intermediate \ncompounds such as Na2O, Al2O and MgO [22]. As such, it proved impossible to directly glaze epoxy \n 5 \ntile grouts. Also, the coating of epoxy tile grout with a vitrifiable substance was not possible since the \nactual bonding mechanism by which the grout adheres to surfaces to which it is applied is \nmechanical, or more precisely hydraulic, and is achieved as a result of the acrylic emulsion \nhydraulically bonding to the surface [23]. Since the grout does not bond to surfaces chemically, it is \nunable to withstand elevated temperatures. Indeed, at temperatures above 200\n0\nC the grout will \nactually de-bond from the surface it is applied to [24], a temperature well below the softening point \nof commercial vitreous coating materials. \nBased on the findings of previous work conducted by Lawrence et al. [2, 4], nine different oxide \ncompounds and three types of enamel frit were chosen as the materials with which to develop the \nsingle-stage seal. The selected oxide compounds were: pozzolana; chamotte; Al2O3; SiO2; Fe2O3; \nFeS2; Zn; MgO and ZrO2. The selected oxide compounds were obtained in powder form with various \nparticle sizes. To ensure particle size consistency the powders were in turn fine ground with a pestle \nand mortar and then sieved through a 45 \u00b5m mesh. The enamel frits are commercially available and \nwere obtained from Ferro Group (UK) Ltd. The compositions of the enamel frits consisted mainly of \nthe following: SiO2; B2O3; Na2O; Mn and small quantities of Ba; Al2O3 and Ni, whilst the powder \nsize was approximately 20 \u00b5m. The selected compounds and the selected enamel frits were then \nthoroughly mixed together in various compositions to ensure homogeneity, along with approximately \n50% diluted sodium-silicate-solution so as to form a manageable paste. The single-stage grout \nmixtures in this paste form were then immediately applied to ordinary Portland cement (OPC) \nsubstrates (50 x 50 x 10 mm\n3\n) and, according to the findings of cursory trials conducted to determine \nthe optimum settling time, allowed to cure for 24 h prior to the HPDL treatment. The thickness of the \nmaterials on the OPC substrate was monitored and kept at approximately 3 mm across the whole of \nthe surface. Unfortunately it proved impossible to generate satisfactory glazes using any of these \nmixes; microcracking and porosity generation to varying degrees, as well as inconsistent glazing were \never present features (see Discussion). Consequently a new approach was adopted. Whereas \npreviously the compounds and the enamel frit were combined together to form a single amalgamated \nmixture, the new approach specifically kept the compounds and the enamel frit apart. However, \nprevious work by Lawrence et al. [2-4, 25, 26] revealed that in order for the enamel frit to wet and \nbond to the compound mixtures, HPDL surface treatment of the compound mixtures was necessary \n(so as to generate a vitrified surface) prior to the application of the enamel frit. This resulted in a two-\nstage HPDL sealing process. The solution found for this problem was to use crushed vitrified ceramic \ntiles as a bulk filler, since the enamel frit will readily wet this material without the need for prior \nHPDL surface treatment, with the enamel frit placed directly on top as shown in Fig. 1. In this way a \nsingle-stage HPDL sealing process could be achieved as theoretically the materials could be applied \nin a single action and only one pass of the HPDL would be required. \n 6 \n3. Experimental procedures \n3.1. Materials preparation and application \nUK standard 150 x 150 x 5 mm\n3\n vitrified ceramic tiles were cut into smaller pieces, 20 x 20 mm\n2\n, for \nexperimental purposes and applied in pairs to an OPC substrate using standard epoxy tile grout \n(Vallance Ltd). The spacing between the vitrified edges of each tile pair was the industry \nrecommended 1.5 mm. The fixed ceramic tile pieces were then allowed to set for the standard setting \ntime of 24 h. Vitrified ceramic tiles were crushed and fine ground using a pestle and mortar and then \nsieved to ensure a particle size of less than 30 \u00b5m. So as to form a manageable paste, the vitrified \nceramic tile powder was mixed with approximately 50wt% water diluted sodium silicate solution. \nThe vitrified ceramic tile paste was then placed into the void, flush to the surface of the tiles and \nallowed to cure for 8 h. The set mixture was then overlaid directly with a thin layer (500 \u00b5m) of \nenamel frit which, in order to form a manageable paste, was mixed with 20wt% white spirit. The \ncomposition of the enamel consisted mainly of the following: SiO2; B2O3; Na2O; Mn and small \nquantities of Ba; Al2O3 and Ni, whilst the powder size was less than 25 \u00b5m. The enamel frit paste was \nallowed to cure for 1 h and then irradiated immediately with the defocused HPDL beam. \n3.2. Laser processing arrangement \nThe laser used in the study was a surgical HPDL (Diomed Ltd.), emitting at 810nm \u00b120nm and \noperating in the CW mode with rated optical powers ranging from 0-60 W. The HPDL beam was \ndelivered to the work area by means of a 4 m long, 600 \u00b5m core diameter optical fibre, the end of \nwhich was connected to a 2:1 focusing lens assembly mounted on the z-axis of a 3-axis CNC gantry \ntable. The single-stage ceramic tile grout was irradiated using the defocused high order mode HPDL \nbeam with a beam spot diameter of 1.75 mm and HPDL powers (measured at the workpiece after \nfibre and optics losses using a Power Wizard power meter) of 10-45 W. Fig. 1 illustrates the laser \nprocessing experimental arrangement, wherein the defocused HPDL beam was fired along the \nvitrifiable enamel frit placed in the void between adjoining vitrified ceramic tiles by traversing the \nsamples beneath the HPDL beam using the x- and y-axis of the CNC gantry table at speeds ranging \nfrom 1-20 mm\/s. In order to study the possible effects of different process gasses, 3 l\/min of coaxially \nblown O2 assist gas was used to shield the HPDL optics, whilst the fumes produced were removed \nwith an extraction system. In order to analyse the HPDL treated specimens, they were sectioned with \na Struers cutting machine using a diamond rimmed cutting blade and then polished using cloths and \ndiamond suspension pastes. The sectioned samples were then examined using optical microscopy, \nscanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) \ntechniques. \n 7 \n4. High power diode laser processing characteristics \n4.1. Effect of laser operating parameters \nCeramic tiles were successfully sealed with power densities as low as 200 kW\/mm2 and at rates of up \nto 100-600 mm\/min. Within these conditions good quality surface glazes displaying neither \ndiscernible microcracks nor porosities could be generated. A typical example of a glaze generated \nwithin these laser operating parameters is shown in Fig. 2. \nVariations in the laser power density were seen to have a significant effect upon the surface \nmorphology of the enamel glazes. A minimum power density level of around 100 kW\/mm\n2\n was \nobserved, below which incomplete glazing of the enamel occurred, regardless of the traverse speed. \nHPDL interaction at this level resulted in a seal which appeared only partially vitrified. At a \nrelatively medium power density (200 kW\/mm\n2\n), however, the quality of the enamel surface glaze on \nthe enamel was much improved. Here complete vitrification of the enamel occurred, with the surface \ndisplaying very few microcracks and no porosities. When glazing with a relatively high power \ndensity (300 kW\/mm\n2\n), the quality of the enamel surface glaze was extremely poor, displaying many \nlarge microcracks and porosities.  \nAs with power density variations, changes to the traverse speed had a significant effect upon the \nsurface morphology of the enamel glaze. From the experiments it was observed that at relatively low \n(<120 mm\/min) and high (>480 mm\/min) traverse speeds, the surface condition of the enamel glazes \nwere unacceptable. In such instances the glazed surfaces displayed many large porosities and \nmicrocracks. At medium traverse speeds in the range of 180-420 mm\/min, however, good quality \nsurface glazes on the enamel could be generated which displayed neither porosities nor microcracks. \n4.2. Glazing\/melting characteristics \nExposure of the crushed ceramic tile mix to rapid heating as a result of HPDL vitrification of the \nenamel frit results in further densification of the upper section of the crushed ceramic tile mix. This \nessentially entails the removal of the pores between the starting particles of the mix, combined with \ngrowth together and strong bonding between adjacent particles [27]. As the microscopic cross-\nsectional examination of the single-stage seal shown in Fig. 3 reveals, the crushed ceramic tile mix \nexhibits an upper densified layer, with a gradual decrease in the amount of densification as the depth \nincreases. In addition, an XRD analysis of the crushed ceramic tile mix after HPDL vitrification of \nthe enamel frit revealed that the structure was mainly polycrystalline in nature, with only partial \nvitrification taking place. This indicates that the densification of the upper sections of the crushed \nceramic tile mix is achieved primarily by solid-state material transport, driven by differences in free-\nenergy or chemical potential [27]. However, the fact that partial vitrification of upper section of the \n 8 \ncrushed ceramic tile mix was observed suggests that the formation of a liquid glass phase was \ninduced, which is often the case with ceramic materials [27]. \n4.3. Bonding characteristics \nThe typical bond region between the enamel glaze and the crushed ceramic tile is shown in Fig. 4. As \nis evident from Fig. 4, there is no dendritic growth in bond region which is characteristic of enamels \nfired onto substrates containing Fe, Si and in particular, Co [28]. However, as one can see from Fig. \n4, it appears that an interface region in which some of the base crushed ceramic tile mix had \ndissolved into the enamel exists. Indeed, an EDX analysis of the bond region between the enamel seal \nand the crushed ceramic tile mix revealed that within this interface region, elements unique to both \ncomponents of the single-stage ceramic tile grout seal were present. \n5. Mechanical, chemical and physical characteristics of the single-stage ceramic tile \ngrout seal \nExisting British and international standards in relation to tile grout are concerned only with water \nabsorption and compressive strength, whilst for actual ceramic tiles, standard tests exist for the \ndetermination of water absorption and chemical resistance. As such it was not possible to test the \nHPDL generated seals according to, and strictly adhering to, established tests. Consequently, \nwherever possible, tests based on current standards were developed to investigate specific aspects of \nparticular relevance to the HPDL generated seals, namely the pull-off strength, the surface roughness, \nthe rupture\/impact strength, the wear resistance, the permeability characteristics (water) and the \ncorrosion resistance. Details of these actual tests can be found elsewhere [3] \nMarked variations in the results with changes in the laser operating parameters were observed. But \nlittle variation within the optimum laser operating parameters was observed, thus implying that \nneither the power density nor the traverse speed influenced the bond strength of the enamel glaze. \nThe average strength of the bond between the enamel glaze and the crushed ceramic tile mix was \nrecorded as 79 MPa, whilst the strength of the bond between the enamel glaze and the borosilicate \nglass surface of the ceramic tiles was found to be 52 MPa. A post-test analysis of the samples showed \nthat in both cases, bond failure occurred at the interface between the enamel glaze and the materials. \nFurther, an optical analysis of the detached surfaces showed that the enamel had detached cleanly and \ncompletely from the crushed ceramic tile mix and the borosilicate glass surface of the ceramic tiles. \nThe surface roughness of the enamel glaze is one of the most important features of the single-stage \nceramic tile grout seal, for it is this that determines the cleanability of the tiled surface as a whole. \nUsing the Taylor-Hobson Surtonic 3+ surface texture measuring instrument, a series of measurements \n 9 \nwere taken on the surface of a layer of an epoxy grout (polished to ensure a measurement could be \ntaken), the vitrified surface of a ceramic tile and the surface of the enamel glaze. On each sample, \nfour measurements were taken in different positions and in different directions on the surface, with \nan average being taken. Table 1 summarises the surface roughness (Ra) measurement results. As is \nevident from Table 1, the surface roughness of the enamel seal is many times less than that of a \nconventional epoxy grout, even when polished. In ordinary operating conditions where the surface \nroughness of the epoxy grout is not polished, but is determined by the means of application, the \nsurface roughness was measured to be in excess of 30 \u00b5m. Clearly, in this situation the surface \nroughness, and hence the cleanability, of the single-stage ceramic tile grout seal will be considerably \nbetter. \nTests were conducted to determine the rupture strength of the enamel glaze when comprising a \ncomplete single-stage ceramic tile grout seal and the vitreous glaze on the surface of a ceramic tile. \nThe results of the experiments revealed that there was little variation between the average rupture \nstrength of the enamel seal and the vitreous tile glaze, 2.8 J and 3.0 J, with the enamel seal ranging \nfrom 2.5-3.0 J, whilst the vitreous tile glaze ranged from only 2.9-3.0 J. It is interesting to note that \nbecause of the shape of the tile edges, the enamel glaze when HPDL fired naturally assumes a \nconcave surface geometry. As such, the strains within the enamel layer are higher, therefore reducing \nthe strength (if the enamel glaze assumed a flat surface profile) by some 40-50% [29]. Additionally, it \nis well established that substrate thickness has a significant effect upon the rupture strength of an \nenamel coating [29]. As such, because the thickness of the single-stage ceramic tile grout seal as a \nwhole was not controlled as accurately as the thickness of the bulk ceramic tile material, then slight \nvariations in the recorded rupture strength are perhaps to be expected. \nThe wear resistance of a material is generally determined by the hardness of the material in \ncomparison with the hardness of other materials with which it comes into contact [30]. Hence the \ngreater hardness of the compositional components of the enamel glaze on the single-stage ceramic tile \ngrout (principally SiO2, B2O3, Na2O and Mn) in comparison with the epoxy tile grout (principally \nCaCO3 and dolomite) probably results in improved wear resistance. However, wear resistance does \nnot always increase with hardness [31]. Tests were therefore to determine the exact difference in \nwear resistance between the conventional epoxy tile grout and the glazed enamel surface of the \nsingle-stage ceramic tile grout. Fig. 8 shows the relationship between weight loss and the friction \ntime for the test pieces. As one can see, the wear resistance of the glazed enamel seal is considerably \ngreater than the epoxy tile grout, with the weight loss being 9 times lower than for the epoxy tile \ngrout after 4 h, and 14 times lower after 8 h. \nPerhaps the most important function of the single-stage ceramic tile grout is its propensity for \npreventing harmful agents from permeating through it. In order to test the permeability of the single-\n 10 \nstage ceramic tile grout seal, in particular the glazed enamel surface, comparison experiments with \nconventional epoxy tile grout were conducted in terms of water permeability. The tests were based on \nBS 6906 [32]. From the tests it was found that the conventional epoxy tile grout had an average water \npermeability of approximately 4.18 x 10\n-3\n mg\/h.cm\n2\n, whilst the single-stage ceramic tile grout seal \nexhibited no measurable permeability. Such a result confirms that not only is the enamel seal fully \namorphous, but that since there are no cracks or porosities in the enamel glaze or the interface \nbetween the enamel glaze and the borosilicate glass tile surface, it is reasonable to assume that a \ncontinuous impervious surface has therefore been created across the surface of the tiles and the seal.  \nTiled surfaces are often subjected to corrosive substances, either as part of the normal service \nenvironment and\/or as a result of routine cleaning. Consequently, corrosion resistance tests based \nupon BS 6431 [33] were conducted using nitric acid (HNO3), sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and a \ndetergent cleaner (MP9, Premier Products). The experiments were carried out by dropping small \namounts of the corrosive agents in the concentration ratios of 80%, 60%, 40%, 20% and 10% on to \nthe surface of the epoxy tile grout and the glazed enamel surface of the single-stage tile grout at \nhourly intervals for 4 h. The samples were then examined optically and mechanically tested in terms \nof compressive strength and wear. High concentrations of the various corrosive agents were used \nprincipally to accelerate the tests. However, in practice 60% HNO3 is used within the nuclear \nprocessing industry as a solvent for nuclear fuels [34], whilst within the food processing and brewing \nindustries, tiled surfaces are washed repeatedly many times a day with detergent cleaners [35]. All \nthree substances in the concentrations 80%, 60% and 40% were seen to immediately attack the epoxy \ntile grout surface, with the HNO3 and NaOH attacking with greater severity than the detergent. In \ncontrast, the glazed enamel displayed no discernible microstructural changes or signs of \ndevitrification due to corrosion. Tests conducted according to ASTM C579-91 [36] revealed that \nexposure of the epoxy tile grout to the reagents had a significant effect upon the compressive strength \nand the wear resistance of the epoxy grout. Exposure of the epoxy grout to HNO3 and NaOH in the \nconcentrations 40-80% resulted in an average loss of compressive strength of approximately 35-71%. \nIn the case of the detergent, a significant loss in compressive strength only occurred with \nconcentrations above 40%. Here the average loss in compressive strength for concentrations in the \nrange 60-80% was approximately 15-30%. This compares with no discernible difference in either the \nwear resistance or the compressive strength single-stage ceramic tile grout. Likewise, the wear \nresistance of the epoxy grout was significantly affected, particularly through interaction with the \nHNO3 and the NaOH. Here the weight loss was approximately 5 times higher than for the unexposed \nepoxy tile grout after 4 h, and approximately 10 times higher after 8 h for both reagents. In the case of \nthe detergent, the weight loss was twice as high as that recorded for the unexposed epoxy tile grout \nafter 4 h, and 5 times higher after 8 h. \n 11 \n6. Discussion of single-stage ceramic tile grout seal characteristics \nThe failure to generate complete glazes with the initial tile grout combinations detailed previously \nalong the full length and breadth of the HPDL interaction zone can be attributed almost entirely to the \nwettability and bonding characteristics of the molten optimum single-stage tile grout. The bonding of \nparticles takes place by means of localised laser induced heating. The duration of the laser beam \nincident on any one particle is short, typically between 0.5 and 25 ms. Therefore the thermally-\ninduced bonding reactions must be kinetically rapid. Two such mechanisms are viscous flow when \nthe powder has the appropriate temperature dependant viscosity and melting. \nMaterials with strongly temperature-dependent viscosities (or low activation energy for viscous flow) \nhave been readily processed using laser radiation. Such materials include a number of thermoplastic \npolymers and rubber. Even at temperatures approaching the melting point, metals and ceramics are \norders of magnitude more viscous than polymeric materials. For this reason, solid-state bonding \nmechanisms are not applicable for laser sintering. Thus a melting\/solidification approach has been \ndeveloped [27]. Attempts to laser sinter a number of metals [38, 39] and ceramic materials [2, 4, 26, \n27] have revealed the phenomena of \u2018balling\u2019. Here, when melting has been induced by the laser \nbeam, the molten powder consolidates rapidly into a spheres approximately equal to the laser beam \ndiameter rather than consolidating into a continuous layer. Such an occurrence was observed after \nHPDL interaction with the initial single-stage tile grout mixtures. It is believed that balling of the \ninitial single-stage tile grout compounds was caused by the material possessing a low melt viscosity \nwhich in turn allows surface energy effects to determine the final geometry. As such, since the molten \nmaterial is often completely contained by loose powder rather than a fully dense material, then this \npowder is unable to exert tensile traction on the liquid to confine the melt to a layerwise geometry.  \nAs mentioned previously, within the optimum operating parameters, the HPDL fired enamel glazes \non the surface of the single-stage tile grout seals generally displayed neither porosities nor \nmicrocracks. The major reason for this highly beneficial occurrence is the value of the thermal \ngradient, \u2206T, induced in the enamel during HPDL irradiation. This is due partly to the fact that the \nsoftening point of the enamel powder is around 500\n0\nC, hence the tensile stresses that result from the \nunrelieved elastic stresses that occur due to the contraction of the material between the softening \npoint (500\n0\nC) and ambient temperature (20\n0\nC) are reduced to a value well below that of the fracture \nstrength of the enamel. The thermal stress, \u03c3, induced by a thermal gradient can be calculated using \nthe Kingery equation: \n  \u03c3\n\u03b1\n\u03c5\n=\n\u2212\nE T\u2206\n1\n  (1) \n 12 \nwhere, E is Young\u2019s modulus, \u03b1 is the coefficient of thermal expansion and \u03bd is Poisson\u2019s ratio. \u2206T is \nthe difference between the critical temperature (below which stresses can no longer be relieved) and \nambient temperature. For the enamel used this is the difference between the softening point, 500\n0\nC \nand ambient temperature 20\n0\nC. Since the softening point of the enamel is 500\n0\nC, that is the enamel \ncan be plastically deformed at temperatures above 500\n0\nC, then the thermal stresses arising during \ncooling from above 500\n0\nC are relieved by plastic deformation. But unrelieved elastic stresses result \ndue to contraction occurring between 500\n0\nC and ambient temperature. Thus for the enamel used \n\u2206T=480\n0\nC. So, by using the following values for the enamel: E=6.25 x 10\n4\n MN\/m\n2\n, \u03b1=33 x 10\n-7\n K\n-1\n \nand \u03bd=0.162 [40] and introducing them into Eq. (1), the thermal stress induced in the enamel during \nHPDL irradiation is calculated to be 118 MN\/m2. This value is below that of the fracture strength of \nthe enamel, 135 MN\/m2 [40], and as such cracking will not occur, thus rendering any pre- or post-\nheating of the enamel completely unnecessary. \nAccording to the types of materials used, complex combinations of the various bonding mechanisms \nactually come into play [41]. For the crushed ceramic tile mix and the enamel, the mechanisms \ninvolved in ceramic-glass bonding are reasonably applicable. These principally include: physical \nbonding (van der Waals forces), chemical bonding (oxide transformation and O2 bridging) and on a \nvery small scale, electrochemical reactions such as the electrolytic effect (redox reaction) due to the \npresence of ferric oxides within the crushed ceramic tile mix reacting with other oxides in the enamel \n[41]. However, in the case of the crushed ceramic tile mix and the enamel, the predominant bonding \nmechanism results from physical forces; since adhesion between many materials is assured by \nelectron transfer and is, therefore, related to bandgap energy [42]. Thus for non-conducting materials, \nsuch as the crushed ceramic tile mix, with large bandgaps, there will be practically no free charges \ninside the ceramic crystals, even at elevated temperatures. In this case the electron transfer at the \ninterface will not take place since the electron transfer depends exclusively on the concentration of \nfree charges in the ceramic crystal [42]. As a result, the chemical contribution to the work of \nadhesion is negligible [42]. Nevertheless, the bonding mechanism between the HPDL treated crushed \nceramic tile mix and the enamel may not be entirely due to physical forces owing to the fact that \nenamel glazes on ceramic materials such as the crushed ceramic tile mix are typically bonded as a \nresult of some of the base material dissolving into the glaze [42]. Indeed, it is well known that Na\n+\n is \nextremely mobile and can, therefore, diffuse to create an interfacial zone of intermediate \ncomposition. However, such an interfacial zone was not observed during a cross-sectional analysis of \nthe bond region. \n \n 13 \n7. Development of the portable high power diode laser-based single-stage ceramic tile \ngrout sealing system \nThe design requirements for the single-stage ceramic tile grout sealing system can be categorised into \nthree different groups: the process supply system; process control and the waste removal system. The \nprocess supply system encompasses the laser, the optics system, the gas supply and any chemicals \nthat may be required. Process control includes the monitoring and control of the operation, any \npossible logging requirements, and the main safety circuit. The waste removal system includes the \nextraction system for gaseous and particulate matter. Filtration systems for these waste materials can \nbe added as their generation from the process becomes manifest. To lend the system the ability to be \nportable, as well as providing the system as much commercial application flexibility as possible, a \nsystem based on a hand-held device was decided upon. This subsequently generates a number of \nprerequisite requirements which define the capabilities of the intended system. These are principally: \n1. Process Specifications - Scanning speeds between 100 and 600 mm\/s, irradiance levels of between \n100 and 300 kW\/mm\n2\n, variable spot sizes between 1 and 5 mm diameter (expected to lie in the \nregion of 1.5 mm) and a flexible power delivery system, i.e. fibre optic beam delivery system. \n2. Safety Requirements - A reasonable flow of process gas to shift any particulate matter generated, \nClass 1 laser safety standard through the incorporation of interlock systems, guards etc. and \nfiltration and gas absorption devices to be added as required \nIn Fig 6 a rendered solid model of the hand-held HPDL beam delivery system is shown. The basic \nspecification envelope is approximately 170 x 130 x 130 mm\n3\n. The main housing unit of the device is \nmachined from a solid aluminium block, with the additional components such as the handle, screen, \noptics core, extraction piping, optical fibre units, etc. being manufactured individually and then \nattached around the main housing unit. The basic design of the main housing unit holds the optics \ncore and nozzle along the central axis, with the tip of the nozzle being just above the intended \ninteraction spot. The end of the nozzle is surrounded by a reflective dome, cut into the main block, \nwith its centre on the interaction spot. This will ensure that any reflected radiation is returned straight \nback to the interaction spot, thus allowing for a more efficient process. The supply of process gas is \nprovided through the optics core and is therefore coaxial with the laser radiation. To monitor the \nprocess and to ensure good validation of the parameters, the speed is taken on one of the interlock \nwheels and displayed on top of the handle. An endoscope camera in the dome allows for monitoring \nof the interaction zone and ensures that the operator has good control over the alignment of the beam. \nThe lower edge of the central block is approximately 1 mm above the tile surface. This gap, although \nsmall, must be closed for safety reasons. \n 14 \nThe 1 mm gap corresponds to a 2 degree opening angle, seen from the centre of the dome. Assuming \na lambertian body as the target material, 0.06 % of the reflected radiation would escape through this \ngap (integrated over all directions). The gap area of the sphere can be approximated at 1.9 cm\n2\n. \nAssuming the laser system operates at 110 W output power, this will result in a leakage power of \n0.066 W, and therefore in a leakage power density of 3.5 W\/mm\n2\n. Although this figure is very small, \nfor safety reasons this must be blocked also. To this end, a row of carbon brushes will be attached to \nthe edges of the main block, in effect optically sealing the interaction area and ensuring Class 1 laser \noperation, in conjunction with the wheel interlocks, which interrupt the laser should the system be \nlifted off the processing surface. \nParticulate extraction is handled by four 10 mm diameter extraction pipes, which are set in even gaps \naround the edges of the dome. Previous designs for a paint stripping processes [43], utilising three     \n6 mm pipes have proven very successful, and the additional capacity may come in useful for grout \nremoval applications [44]. The extraction system will remove the material through the handle into a \nparticulate filter. Gas absorption filtration can be added when necessary. Extraction and supply of \ngas, command signals, as well as the laser fibre will be run through an umbilical line which enters the \nhand-piece through the handle. This has the added advantage of allowing for a protective sleeve \naround all utility lines, which can be included in the interlock chain. Any damage to this unit, and \npotentially the fibre, will prohibit the use of the laser system. Naturally, the operation switch will be \nconfigured in \u201chold-to-run\u201d mode so as to avoid accidental operation. \n8. Associated safety aspects of the high power diode laser-based single-stage ceramic tile \ngrout sealing system \nAs specified in ISO 11553 [45], it is a requirement that no human exposure to radiation exceeding \nlevels of Class 1, according to BS EN 608251-1 [46], is possible during production (normal or \notherwise). In practice, this requires that no access to a danger zone is possible during operation. Any \nlaser system for production use will in effect have to be a Class 1 system, hence any design will      \nhave to take this issue into account. The maximum permissible exposure (MPE) is defined in           \nBS EN 60825-1 [45] and is subject to the laser intensity, spectral distribution and temporal \nparameters of the radiation system, as well as the type of exposure, i.e. ocular or skin exposure. If one \nassumes a 10 s exposure time limit, then the ocular and skin exposure limits are defined as: \n Ocular exposure limit = 18 0 75 4 6\u22c5 \u22c5t C C\n.\n (J\/m\n2\n) (2) \n     Skin exposure limit = 11 104 0 25 4.\n.\u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5t C  (J\/m2) (3) \n 15 \nwhere t is time, C4 is a correction factor defined as 10\n0 002 700. ( )\u22c5 \u2212\u03bb\n, which for our case (since \u03bb = 810 \nnm) results in C4 = 1.659 and C6 can be assumed to be 1, even if the exposure limit should be \nincreased for diffuse viewing. So, the resulting MPE values determined with assumed exposure times \nof 10 s, 1 s and 10\n-3\n s are given in Table 3. \nThe MPE equivalent power density values are relevant for exposure times from 10\n-3\n s to 10 s, which \nit is believed cover all instances of the single-stage ceramic tile grout sealing processes. Additionally, \nblink reflexes, as well as pain reactions can be assumed to ensure a sufficient limitation in exposure \ntimes [47, 48]. It can be seen that the leakage power density that would be generated from the hand-\npiece without a lower edge beam guard is some way over the MPE irradiance for ocular exposure. It \nshould, however, be noted that the MPE calculated in this case is a worst case scenario, assuming the \nunlikely occurrence of 100% reflection from the interaction zone. The value also does not account for \nthe expanded angular effects through the diffuse radiation. That is, it assumes the exposure occurs \ndirectly at the edge of the handpiece. It can be said with a reasonable amount of confidence that the \nsystem would adequately fulfil the requirements for a Class 1 system, as long as the interlock chain \nensures that there is no irradiation, if the system is not on a process surface. \n9. Conclusions \nOrdinary vitrified ceramic tiles have been successfully sealed using a 60 W high power diode laser \n(HPDL) with power densities as low as 200 kW\/mm\n2\n and at rates as high as 600 mm\/min. A single-\nstage process has been devised using a crushed ceramic tile mix and a commercially available \nvitreous enamel. The crushed ceramic tile mix provides a tough, inexpensive bulk substrate which \nsimply acts a filler for the void between adjoining tiles, whilst the enamel provides an impervious \nsurface glaze.  \nIt is believed that the failure to generate complete glazes with the initial single-stage ceramic tile \ngrout compounds or an amalgamation of the crushed ceramic tile mix and the enamel frit, regardless \nof the ratios used, can be attributed to the wettability and bonding characteristics of the materials. \nMore specifically, because the molten material is often completely contained by loose powder rather \nthan a fully dense material, then this powder is unable to exert tensile traction on the liquid to confine \nthe melt to a layerwise geometry. Hence attempts to seal these initial single-stage grout mixtures with \nthe HPDL resulted in the formation of solid spheres approximately equal in diameter to the width of \nthe HPDL beam, a phenomena known more commonly as \u2018balling\u2019. Bonding of the enamel to the \ncrushed ceramic tile mix was identified as being mainly due to van der Waals forces (dispersion \nforces) and, on a very small scale, slight microstructural changes occurring at the interface between \nthe crushed ceramic tile mix and the molten enamel resulting in some of the crushed ceramic tile mix \n 16 \nmaterial dissolving into the glaze. Optical inspection and water permeability tests revealed that a \ncomplete bond was achieved between the enamel glaze and the crushed ceramic tile mix, as well as \nbetween the enamel glaze and the vitrified surface of the ceramic tiles themselves.  \nThe single-stage ceramic tile grout sealing process has been characterised and has in turn evolved to \nsuch an extent that the development of a hand-held HPDL beam delivery unit and the related \nprocedures necessary to lead to the commercialisation of the process have been successfully carried \nout. Furthermore, an appraisal of the potential hazards associated with the use of the HPDL in an \nindustrial environment has been conducted, with the solutions derived being implemented to ensure \nthat the system complies with the relevant safety standards. \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors would like to express their gratitude to the EPSRC: Process Engineering Group (Grant \nNo. GR\/M46068) for their financial support of this work.
