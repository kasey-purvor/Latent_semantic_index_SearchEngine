INTRODUCTION \n The extent to which large scale forcing of meteorological or barotropic tidal origin is \nconverted to small scale mixing (e.g. Rippeth et al 2005, Zhai et al 2005, Xing and Davies \n2005) is an important topic in physical oceanography as it influences various vertical \nexchange processes.  In addition the problem of determining the extent to which topography \nin stratified regions influences the degree to which barotropic tidal energy is partitioned \nbetween internal waves and mixing has recently been recognised as an important issue in \nlarge scale ocean circulation modelling (Saenko 2006, Saenko and Merrifield 2005, Spall, \n2001).  In shelf edge regions where the density surfaces intersect the shelf slope and there is \nan appreciable barotropic tide, then a significant baroclinic tide with associated mixing is \ngenerated (e.g. New and Pingree 1990, Legg and Adcroft 2003, Baines 1995, Vlasenko et al. \n2005, Xing and Davies 1998, 1999, Van Haren 2006).  Since the shelf edge is the lateral \nboundary of the ocean, enhanced mixing in this region might be expected to influence the \noceanic circulation and hence climate (Saenko and Merrifield 2005).  Recently ocean model \nsimulations have been performed with enhanced mixing in the lateral boundary and have \nshown that shelf edge mixing has an important influence on the ocean circulation (Spall \n2001).  Consequently a detailed knowledge of the conversion of barotropic tidal energy into \nmixing in regions of steep topography and how this is influenced by both large-scale \ntopographic features and small-scale roughness (namely small scale undulations \u201cripples\u201d on \nlarger scale topography) is important in determining what controls boundary layer mixing. \n In parallel with shelf edge work, the extent to which sill topography at the entrance to \nfjords (e.g.  Stigebrandt 1999, Stigebrandt and Aure 1989, Vlasenko et al. 2002) or Lochs \n(Inall et al. 2004, 2005, Stashchuk et al. 2007) gives rise to mixing in the sill region has been \na recent research topic.  In these environments the geographical extent of the problem is \nsignificantly reduced compared with the shelf edge region.  Consequently more detailed \n 3\nmeasurements and finer scale modelling is possible.  By this means the role of small-scale \ntopographic variations (\u201cripples\u201d) in sill regions (e.g. Klymak and Gregg 2001) can be \nexamined in detail giving insight as to the importance of small-scale topography in seabank \nareas (e.g. Nash and Moum 2001, Dewey et al. 2005) and shelf edge regions (e.g. Jeans and \nSherwin 2001). \n Previous high resolution numerical modelling and measurements of the Loch Etive \nsill region (Inall et al. 2004, 2005) showed (Xing and Davies 2007, hereafter XD07) that it \nwas essential to retain the non-hydrostatic effects within these models in order to calculate \nvertical mixing. Subsequently, Davies and Xing (2007)(hereafter DX07) showed that a cross \nsectional model could reproduce the major features of the observed flow and lee wave \nactivity in the region. In addition a cross-sectionally averaged model of Loch Etive, \nincorporating realistic topography was shown (Stashchuk et al., 2007) to reproduce the \ninternal wave field and flow in the region. Although these cross sectional models cannot \ninclude horizontal vortices which contribute to the mixing, these earlier calculations suggest \nthat they can account for mixing produced by non-linear and non-hydrostatic effects.  In \ntheory by using turbulence energy models (Mellor and Yamada 1982) to compute sub-grid \nscale mixing then coarse grid hydrostatic models including such a parameterisation will take \naccount of some of the small scale non-hydrostatic processes that are responsible for mixing.  \nHowever, in order to avoid such parameterizations, and approximations that can give \nerroneous mixing, fully non-linear, non-hydrostatic models such as the one used here are \nrequired.  In addition in order to ensure that such models can accurately reproduce small scale \nmixing, direct numerical simulations on extremely fine grids (resolutions of order 0.001 m or \nless) with values of molecular viscosity and diffusivity are required.  In practice with present \ncomputing power such calculations would be restricted to very small domains (of order tens \nof metres).  Even if such calculations were possible detailed topography on this scale is not \n 4\nknown, and as will be shown here is required if mixing is to be accurately computed. \nRecently Afanasyev and Peltier (2001) carried out some detailed simulations of flow in \nKnight Inlet using a mesh of order 1m. Although this grid is fine it is significantly larger than \nthe grids of order 0.001m commonly used in direct simulations of tank experiments, but is the \nhighest resolution that is practical in oceanographic calculations. However such simulations \nand those presented here cannot resolve Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities which have to be \nparameterized together with any other unresolved motion by using background values of \nviscosity and diffusivity. The assumption here is that a sufficiently fine grid non-hydrostatic \nmodel should contain sufficient physics to examine to what extent changes in topography \ninfluence the internal wave field and mixing. However, as suggested by Cummins (2000) and \ndiscussed in Farmer and Armi (2001), a model that aims to simulate flow in a sill region must \nbe able to accuately represent the bottom boundary layer. As our aim is not to simulate flows \nin sill regions since this would require a very high resolution three dimensional model, but \nrather to examine the influence of topography, we think the present model is adequate for this \nmore limited problem. \nIn view of this earlier work, in order to examine how small and large scale topography \ninfluences the flow, the associated internal wave field together with mixing in the region of a \nsill, it is necessary to use as fine a grid as possible with small background viscosities and \ndiffusivities in order to obtain a stable solution.  Calculations (Berntsen et al. 2008) showed \nthat for the problems considered here, and the grid resolution used in the model (see next \nsection) the solution had converged with respect to the grid.  However, this does not mean \nthat the model can accurately reproduce the mixing, but that it can give insight as to how this \nmixing is influenced by changes in both large and small scale topography, that can be \naccurately resolved on the grid.  As the calculations will show, small scale topography does \nsignificantly influence the mixing, and hence in any model aimed at accurately reproducing \n 5\nthe mixing it is essential to include this small scale topography which at present is ignored in \nmodels of mixing in sill regions.  In addition since this small scale topography has an \nimportant influence on mixing, it needs to be measured in addition to measuring mixing, if \ncomprehensive data sets for modal validation are to become available.  One problem here is \nthat mixing in the region of sills is truly three dimensional, with horizontal vortices and \nacross channel variations in topography playing an important role. This suggests that in any \nmodel validation exercise it will be necessary to collect comprehensive data sets in three \ndimensions rather than just the along channel detailed surveys that are presently performed. \nIn addition calculations will have to be performed using fully three dimensional models using \nvery fine grids, with the associated computational overhead. \nAlthough high resolution models were used by XD07 to examine the influence of sill \nwidth upon non hydrostatic effects, no attempt was made to examine in detail its effect or the \ninfluence of small scale topography upon this mixing.  In short papers, Xing and Davies \n2006a, 2006b (hereafter XD06a,b) briefly examined the effect of one form of small scale \ntopography upon sill mixing.  Here this earlier work is extended to examine in a more \ncomprehensive way, and bring together these preliminary results. In particular the focus is the \nrole of large and small scale topography in particular the location of small scale topography \nrelative to the sill crest (an effect that has never previously been examined) upon mixing in \nsill regions.  As previously calculations are performed with a non-hydrostatic model in \nvertical cross sectional form, in essence a two dimensional slice model, with idealized sill \ntopography.  A range of sill widths are examined, using initially smooth topography on the \nlee side of the sill.  Subsequently small scale topography with a range of ripple heights and \nwavelengths is added to the lee side of the topography.  In addition the influence of the \nlocation of this topography upon mixing is considered. The objective of these calculations is \nto determine the extent to which large scale and small scale topography influence tidal flow, \n 6\nthe associated internal wave field and mixing in sill regions.  By using idealized topography \nthe role of different topographic length scales can be identified. \nIn terms of the Loch Etive sill, and comparable sills at the entrance to lochs and \nfjords, the tidal velocity amplitude (Uo) is typically of order 0.5 m s-1, namely an order of \nmagnitude larger than found in the deep ocean.  In addition the tidal excursion is about 10km \nwhich is substantially larger than sill widths which are usually about 1 to 3 km wide.  Typical \nwater depths (h), of order 100 m, are appreciably shallower than those found in the ocean \n(depths of order 4,000 m), with sill heights (ho) of order 85 m, occupying a large fraction of \nthe water column, compared to the ocean case.  As discussed by Legg and Huijts (2006) there \nare a number of key parameters which control stratified flow over topography.  In particular \nthe Froude number Fr given in Legg and Huijts (2006) as Uo\/Nho with N buoyancy frequency \nwhich as will be shown is significantly larger in the present calculations than in the deep \nocean.  In addition the relative height of topography ho\/h is again larger than in the ocean.  In \nparticular the tidal excursion parameter (RL = Uo\/\u03c9L) with \u03c9 tidal frequency and L \ntopographic length scale is appreciably greater than in the deep ocean, due to the larger Uo \nand smaller L.  As RL increases, so does the non-linearity in the problem, with an increasing \ntendency for higher harmonics of the tide and unsteady lee waves to be generated.  Although \nLegg and Huijts (2006) examined flow over small scale topography in the deep ocean their \nparameter range (large h, small ho\/h, and small Uo) is very different to those considered here.   \nAlso in the case of other sills such as Knight Inlet, the tidal excursion is comparable \nto the sill width (of order 3 km) and hence RL is significantly lower than the cases considered \nhere where the response to a narrow sill (width of order 1 km) is considered.  In essence the \npresent calculations, in particular those with \u201csmall scale topography\u201d superimposed on a \nnarrow sill, extends the parameter range beyond that previously considered, and show the \nimportance of small scale topography in enhancing mixing in sill regions. \n 7\n2. NUMERICAL MODEL \nAlthough a number of non-hydrostatic models exist in the literature (e.g. Lamb \n(1994), Gerkema (2002), Berntsen and Furnes (2005), Heggelund et al. (2004) as in earlier \nwork (XD06a,b, XD07) calculations were performed using the MIT code, which employs a \nvertical z coordinate together with a partial cell and a finite volume discretization at the \nbottom boundary.  In the calculations described here, the free surface form of the model was \nused.  As details are given in Marshall et al. 1997a,b, they are not repeated here.  In all \ncalculations the model was used in two dimensional (x, z) cross sectional form initially with \nidealized topography and water depths representing the sill at the entrance to Loch Etive, the \nlocation of recent measurements (Inall et al. 2004, 2005).  In all calculations motion was \ninduced by barotropic tidal forcing of M2 tidal period (namely 12.42 hrs) at the western open \nboundary and a time step dt = 2 s.  A Flather type radiation condition was applied for the \nbarotropic tidal input at the open boundary.  For the baroclinic motion a flow relaxation zone \nwas used, with the temperature relaxed to its initial value.  Such a condition is similar to the \nsponge layer used by Nakamura et al. (2000).  Unfortunately this boundary condition is not \nideal, and in limited area domains if long term calculations are performed, some weakly \nreflected waves can propagate back into the region of interest.  For this reason since the \ndomain of the Loch Etive model is small, only short term calculations can be performed \nbefore internal wave reflection from the boundaries influence the solution near the sill.  \nAlthough in the Loch Etive case a detailed study of the generation of internal waves in \nhydrostatic and non-hydrostatic models has been performed previously (XD07) with DX07, \nlooking at the internal wavefield in the region and a brief indication of the role of small scale \ntopography has been given (XD06a), a more rigorous presentation of the influence of small \nscale topography upon the internal wave field has never been considered and is given here. \nAlso its role upon the mixing which was not presented in XD06a is given here and discussed \n 8\nin detail.  However, in order to examine these processes in more detail and to perform power \nspectral analysis in subsequent calculations symmetric sills of varying width and including \nsmall scale topographic effects were used.  In addition to examine the energy cascade from \nlong period to short period motion, longer time integrations were performed requiring the use \nof a larger domain.  Although some of this work was briefly presented in a short note \n(XD06b), a more comprehensive report, including new results, particularly those that show \nhow small scale topography near the sill top influence Richardson number distribution and \nmixing for the first time are given here. \nConsidering initially the loch problem, where water depths, loch length and sill width \n(Fig. 1) were taken to approximate those of Loch Etive.  However, the topography was much \nsimpler than in Loch Etive where there were a number of sills within the Loch which \nnarrowed towards its head.  As details of the Loch Etive topography are shown in Inall et al. \n2004, 2005, they will not be repeated here.  Since in this paper the main focus is to examine \nhow small scale features of the topography that are often not measured with any degree of \naccuracy influence the solution, both idealized large scale and small scale topography will be \nused to gain insight as to the role of the topography.  Consequently no direct comparison with \nInall et al 2004, 2005 can be made.  In addition no detailed discussion of the time evolution \nof the flow, or how the internal wave field compares with measurements will be presented \nhere, as these topics are covered in XD07. Here the focus is on the role of how topography \naffects mixing, and as such, the dimensions of the large and small scale topographic features \n(\u201cripples\u201d) used in the calculations are relevant to modelling loch and fjord regions and \nmeasurements within them.   \nIn all calculations, a fine uniform grid resolution dz = 1 m was used in the vertical \nwith the horizontal grid gradually varying from dx = 10 m in the sill region to 100 m outside \nthis area.  These grid resolutions were chosen based upon a convergence study of the \n 9\ninfluence of grid resolution upon model accuracy (Berntsen et al. 2008).  This study showed \nthat the dominant features of the internal flow and wave field could be accurately resolved \nwith such a grid.  In addition the grid could accurately represent small scale changes in \ntopography which are usually measured with a coarser resolution.  By using such a high \nresolution grid, artificial\/numerical viscosity and diffusion could be kept to a minimum, \nunlike in conventional shallow sea models with grids of order kilometres.  Obviously this \ncould not remove all artificial viscosity and diffusion which arises due to the finite difference \nform of the equations used to represent the hydrodynamic equations. To effectively remove \nthese, as discussed previously grid scales of the order of 0.001m would be required, or the \nhydrodynamic equations solved using a spectral approach with a large (of order 1000) \nnumber of functions.  Naturally both of these approaches would yield a computationally \nimpractical calculation.  However by using the present high resolution grid it is possible to \nminimise artificial viscosity and diffusivity and to examine to what extent changes in \ntopography, in particular the addition of \u201cripple topography\u201d changes small scale features of \nthe flow and influences mixing.  However, as discussed previously mixing is in reality a three \ndimensional process, and hence cross channel variations in topography will also have a \ncontribution.  Hence with such a fine grid in order to avoid artificial smoothing of the \nsolution by using high background diffusion and viscosity coefficients, the coefficients of \nvertical and horizontal viscosity were set at AV = 10-3 m2 s-1, Ah = 10-1 m2 s-1, with \ncorresponding diffusivities of KV = Kh = 10-7 m2 s-1 in essence set at molecular levels.  \nAlthough the choice of these coefficients is to a certain extent arbitrary, they are significantly \nsmaller than those used in conventional coarser grid oceanographic models.  Also by using \nthe same coefficients in the calculations without and with \u201cripple topography\u201d, the influence \nof this change in topography can be assessed independently of that due to viscosity and \ndiffusivity. \n 10\n As shown recently (Scotti et al., (2007), Scotti and Mitran (2008)) if the ratio \nof horizontal grid size to water depth is of the order of (h\/10) then the horizontal grid is \nsufficiently fine to represent non-hydrostatic flow.  In the present case in the sill region \nnamely -2000m to +2000m, dx=10m with h varying from 15m to 100m.  Hence near the sill \ntop where there is no slope this criterion is not exactly satisfied, although elsewhere it is. In \nthe \u201cfar field\u201d where dx=100m this criterion is violated, but in this region there is no slope \nand non-hydrostatic effects are not important.  In addition in the present calculations the full \nnon-linear, non-hydrostatic equations are being solved in the presence of \u201crippled \ntopography\u201d a situation more complex than that considered by Scotti and Mitran (2008).  \nHowever, resolution is an important issue and as discussed above, as fine a grid as possible is \nreally required, and the Scotti et al., (2007) and Scotti and Mitran (2008) criterion is valuable \nin choosing this grid, although as shown by the convergence study of Berntsen et al (2009) \nthe present grid is sufficiently fine for the problem considered. \n A no heat flux boundary condition was applied at sea surface and sea bed, together \nwith a zero surface stress condition and a quadratic friction law at the sea bed, with drag \ncoefficient k = 0.0025, a typical shallow sea value.  \n3. INFLUENCE OF TOPOGRAPHY (LOCH ETIVE SILL) \nThe topography of the region (Fig. 1) is characterized by a constant water depth at the \nwestern end of the domain (h = 50 m) with an open boundary at x = -6500 m.  The sill is \nsituated at x = 0, with a sill water depth hs = 15 m, with water depths increasing to h = 100 m \non the eastern side of the sill, corresponding to a constant depth basin closed at its eastern end \n(x = 15000 m).  Initial conditions consisted of a horizontal uniform temperature field, with a \nlinear vertical temperature gradient giving a constant buoyancy frequency (N).  Initial \nconditions at time t = 0, of zero horizontal along loch velocity (u) and vertical (w) velocity \nwere specified.  Motion was induced by barotropic tidal forcing of the form \n 11\n     U = Uo sin (\u03c9t), \napplied at the open boundary.  Here Uo is the specified amplitude of the tidal current, at the \nM2 frequency \u03c9.  At the open boundary the temperature field was relaxed to its initial value.  \nThe Coriolis parameter f was fixed at 1.2 x 10-4 s-1, an appropriate value for Loch Etive.  As \nin all cross sectional models with non zero f, a cross loch velocity v which is initially zero is \ngenerated.  However, the two dimensional cross sectional form means that all derivatives in y \ndirection are set to zero. This form of the model is common to all vertical slice models of \nlochs and fjords (see Vlasenko et al. (2005), Stashchuk et al. (2007) and references therein for \nmore detail).  To determine the influence of small scale topography upon mixing in the sill \nregion, calculations were performed initially (Calc 1, Table 1) with the smooth topography \nshown in Fig. 1, and subsequently with additional rough\/rippled small scale topography (Calc \n2, Table 1), on the steep side of the sill.  By placing rippled small scale topography on one \nside of the sill rather than both, its local effect (namely changes in the region of topography) \ncan be separated from its \u201cfar field\u201d effect, namely changes on the other side of the sill. \n3.1 Solution with smooth topography (Calc 1) \n As the dominant aspects of the tidal flow over the sill are discussed in XD07 and \nXD06a, they will not be presented here. Rather we will concentrate on the new aspects of the \nwork, namely, the influence of both the short (first tidal cycle) (not considered in XD07, \nXD06a,b, although as we will show important in determining how small scale topography \ninfluences the solution) and longer (subsequent cycle) term effects of topography. These \neffects were examined in an initial series of calculations (Calcs 1 and 2) Table 1.  In these \ncalculations Uo = 0.3 m s-1 and a constant vertical temperature gradient chosen such that N = \n0.01 s-1 were used. \n Initially t = 1\/8T (where T is the M2 tidal period) as the flow over the sill increases, \ndownwelling occurs on the lee side and lee waves are generated (see XD07 for a detailed \n 12\ndiscussion of the generation of these lee waves). These lee waves are advected downstream \nby the tidal current as shown in the temperature contours at t = 2\/8T, (Fig. 2a).  Associated \nwith these lee waves are small scale changes in vertical (w) and horizontal (u) velocity (Fig. \n2a) and density inversion cells due to internal wave breaking in the surface layer (Fig. 2a), \nwhich subsequently produce significant vertical mixing in the upper part of the water column.  \nIn addition there is a downslope jet on the right hand side of the sill which also produces \nenhanced mixing on the lee side of the sill.  (see XD07 for a detailed discussion of the \nphysics of this jet separation).  Shear instabilities associated with this jet and the downslope \ndensity field together with regions of density inversion give rise to mixing in the sill region at \ndepth.  During the flood stage the local Froude number on top of the sill given by U\u03c0\/Nh is \nabout 12.5, based on local velocity of 0.6 m s-1, N = 0.01 s-1 and local depth h = 15 m, and \nwave breaking and mixing occur (Nakamura et al. 2000, Nakamura and Awaji (2001)).  The \nflow in this region is supercritical.  However away from the sill top where the water is \ndeeper, h = 100 m, and velocity U is of order 0.1 m s-1, taking N = 0.01 s-1 gives a Froud \nnumber away from the sill of order 0.3 which is sub-critical.  The two regions are separated \nby an hydraulic transition.   \n  At the end of a full tidal cycle (t = T) substantial mixing has taken place in the \nsurface layer (Fig. 2b).  The extent of this mixing will be quantified at the end of the third \ntidal cycle.  In addition at depth on the right hand side of the sill where the flow separation \noccurs there is evidence of enhanced mixing at about z = -40 m.  Since the second tidal cycle \ndoes not start from the same initial conditions as the first then there will be some differences \nin the solution.  However, as will be shown, the basic physical processes in the second cycle \nare identical to those in the first.  As discussed in XD07, and briefly mentioned in XD06a, a \nqualitative comparison shows that the model can reproduce the main features of the flow and \nassociated mixing found in Loch Etive measurements (Inall et al. 2004, 2005).  \n 13\nConsequently, although a rigorous model validation is not possible, the fact that the model \ncan reproduce the main features of the observed flow and mixing, suggests that changes \nproduced by adding small scale topography will be valid. \n At t = 10\/8T, namely t = 2\/8T into the second tidal cycle, there are differences in the \nsolution (Fig. 3a) compared to the first tidal cycle (Fig. 2a).  This arises because some mixing \nhas occurred during the first tidal cycle.  Since the initial density field is weaker than before, \nthe lee wave distribution has been modified giving rise to a slightly different u-current field \nalthough the major features are comparable. At depth (z = -60 m) the temperature field (Fig. \n3a) shows vertical displacements of the isotherms due to lee wave activity.  The magnitude of \nthis displacement is about 18 m, and is in good agreement with the 20 m reported by Inall et \nal. (2004).  However, as we will show this is sensitive to small scale features of the \ntopography since the lee wave distribution depends upon the Fourier transform of the \ntopography.   \n At t = 14\/8T there are no substantial differences in the cross sill velocity compared to \nt = 6\/8T, showing that a sinusoidal barotropic tide had been established.  However, the well-\nmixed region on the right hand side of the sill was more extensive than that at t = 6\/8T.  The \nenhanced mixing is due to the additional mixing that occurred during the first cycle.  At the \nend of the second cycle it is clear from the temperature contours (Fig. 3b) that the region of \nenhanced mixing that occurred on the right hand side of the sill at t = 14\/8T, has now been \nadvected over the top of the sill.  This gives rise to the enhanced well mixed region on the top \nof the sill (Fig. 3b) compared to previously (Fig. 2b).  Similarly at depth in the region of the \nseparation point (z = -40 m) there is increased mixing at t = 16\/8T (the end of the second \ncycle) compared to previously (namely t = T the end of the first cycle) (compare temperature \ncontours in Figs. 2b and 3b).  In order to quantify the mixing over the first three tidal cycles \nthe parameter 2o\n2 NNDN \u2212=  was computed, with No the initial buoyancy frequency and 2N  \n 14\nits average value over a tidal cycle centred at t = 2.5T.  By averaging over a tidal cycle, \nchanges in density due to tidal advection were removed.  Contours of DN (Fig. 3c) clearly \nshow that significant mixing has occurred during the first three tidal cycles.  This leads to a \ndecrease in the temperature gradient in the upper part of the water column, centred at about z \n= -40 m.  A slight increase in temperature gradient centred at about z = -70 m is apparent.  \nThese changes in temperature gradient are indicative of mid-water mixing, occurring at about \nz = -40 m. \n This comparison over three tidal cycles illustrates that mixing in the first two-cycle \ninfluences the density distribution at the end of the third.  In reality freshwater inflow from \nthe head of the loch will tend to re-stratify the region, although it is doubtful if a truly \nperiodic solution in the baroclinic field can be achieved. \n3.2 Influence of small-scale (rough\/ripple) topography (Calc 2) \n In the previous calculation smoothly varying topography was assumed.  In reality \nsmall-scale undulations in topography will occur both along slopes and the sill crest.  Such \nsmall scale variations in topography have been observed on a range of sills, banks and shelf \nslopes (e.g. Inall et al. 2004, 2005, Moum et al. (2007), Klymak and Gregg 2001, Nash and \nMoum (2001), New and Pingree (1990)).  To examine to what extent these influence lee \nwave generation and subsequent mixing a calculation was performed with the same \ntopography but with the addition of small-scale features along the right hand sill slope (Calc \n2, Table 1).  By including small-scale topography along just one slope, the extent to which it \ninfluences the solution on the sill top and along the other slope can be determined.  In \nessence, \u201clocal\u201d and \u201cfar field\u201d effects can be separated.  In reality a range of small scale \ntopographic features exist in sill regions.  Here a typical length scale of 100 m and height of 5 \nm (Fig. 4a) was chosen to illustrate the effect of small scale topography. Although XD06a, \nvery briefly showed that small scale topography influenced lee waves near the Loch Etive \n 15\nsill, that was presented in terms of a \u201csnapshot\u201d of lee wave activity and no significant \ndiscussion was given.  In the present calculation that work is extended to examine the time \nvariability of the flow due to the presence of \u201csmall scale ripples\u201d, and how the tidally \naveraged mixing is influenced by the presence of these \u201cripples\u201d.  In addition discussion of \nthe importance of the influence of ripple topography upon measured diffusivities and those \nused in larger scale models has been added. \n Comparison of a \u201csnap shot\u201d of temperature, u- and w-components of velocity at t = \n2\/8T (Fig. 4a) with previous results (Fig. 2a) shows that the main effect of the small scale \n\u201cripple\u201d topography upon the temperature and u-velocity fields is confined to the near bed \nregion on the right side of the sill.  However, in terms of lee wave generation and hence the \nvertical component of velocity on the lee side of the sill there is an appreciable difference.  \nPreviously (Fig. 2a) at t = 2\/8T, lee waves were primarily confined to the slope region \nextending to x = 1000 m (Fig. 2a).  The effect of the small-scale topography is to increase \nthis region to x = 1500 m (Fig. 4a).  Similarly the region of temperature inversions and \npatches of increased u-surface current that were confined to the area between x = 0 and 1000 \nm, now extends to 1300 m.  Later in time (t = 4\/8T) a well mixed region on the right hand \nside of the sill comparable to that found without ripples has developed.  This suggests that the \nmain features of the mixing in the upper part of the water column close to the sill are not \nparticularly sensitive to small scale topography.  However, at t = 6\/8T as the flow reverses \nand the well mixed region is advected towards the sill, Calc 2 shows that the weakly stratified \nregion at z = -30 m has a larger horizontal extent than previously (Calc 1).  This suggests that \nthe generation of lee waves over a larger section of the sill than previously together with their \nenhanced downstream transport increases the region over which vertical mixing occurs.  On \nthe left side of the sill the density field is not appreciably different to previously, suggesting \nthat small scale topographic effects on one side do not influence the other.  This difference in \n 16\ndownstream and near sill mixing due to small-scale topography is apparent in the temperature \nsurfaces at the end of the first cycle (compare Figs. 4b and 2b).  In addition the u-velocity jet \nat t = T computed with small-scale topography was found to be stronger and extend from the \nsill top out to x = 1500 m, as a continuous flow. \n As in the first calculation, at t = 10\/8T there are appreciable differences in the solution \ncompared to the same time namely t = 2\/8T in the first cycle.  However these differences are \nlarger (compare Figs. 5a and 3a) than in the first calculation.  Also at this time there are \nsubstantial differences in the lee wave distribution, as can be seen in the vertical velocity \ncontours (Fig. 5a compared with 3a).  Despite these differences in lee wave distribution, the \nlarge scale features of the density field in the region of the sill at the end of the second cycle  \n(Fig. 5b) are comparable to those found previously (Fig. 3b).  Comparison of DN \ndistributions (Figs. 3c and 5c) also confirms that away from the sill and the bottom boundary \nlayer the large scale features of the mixing are comparable to those found previously.  \nHowever, the detailed vertical distribution of the temperature and DN field at points in the \nvicinity of the sill even away from the near bed region but particularly in the lower half of the \nwater column (Fig. 5c) are different.  Consequently conclusion concerning eddy diffusivity \nparameterizations derived by vertically sampling this temperature field will be different from \nthose derived by sampling the temperature field computed with smooth topography and \ncannot be simply related to local values of water depth, velocity and initial temperature field \nbut must account for enhanced lee wave activity and resulting mixing produced by small \nscale features.  These calculations suggest that the problem of how to parameterize small \nscale topography, and the associated lee waves to give accurate diffusivities in models that \ncannot resolve small scale topographic features, will be very difficult. \n4. INFLUENCE OF TOPOGRAPHY (SYMMETRIC SILL) \n4.1 Smooth topography (Calc 3) \n 17\n As discussed previously the advantage of using topography representative of Loch \nEtive is that limited qualitative comparisons of lee wave generation and flow separation can \nbe made with published observations. In addition how these results are changed by the \naddition of \u201csmall scale ripple\u201d topography can be assessed in a \u201creal world\u201d situation.  \nHowever, the major disadvantage was the short term nature of the calculations.  In order to \nexamine the longer term influence of topography upon mixing and the transfer of energy \nacross the internal wave spectrum, a larger domain with more idealized topography is \nrequired.  Consequently to examine in more detail the influence of small scale (ripple) \ntopography in particular that on the upper part or lower part of the sill slope, and sill width \n(large scale topography) upon mixing, the previous calculations were repeated using a \nsymmetric sill.  \nAlthough some early results in terms of \u201csnap shots\u201d of the temperature and vertical \nvelocity field were presented in a short paper (XD06b), not attempt was made in that paper to \nassess how changes in topography influenced the time evolution of the flow, and shear \ninstabilities as shown by the Richardson number (Ri) plots presented here.  These problems \nare considered here, as is the influence of a more extensive range of topography than \nconsidered in XD06b. In addition the influence of the initial buoyancy frequency upon the \ntidally averaged mixing is examined. In essence the work presented here extends and \nelaborates that given in XD06b.  In initial calculations (Calcs 3 to 6 in Table 1) both sides of \nthe sill had the same profile as the right hand side of the Loch Etive sill (Fig. 1).  Namely the \nsill depth hs = 15 m, half width ao = 1500 m, with water depth on each side fixed at 100 m.  In \nthese calculations a larger domain than previously was used so that the longer term effects of \nsill mixing could be examined without baroclinic waves being reflected from the boundaries.  \nTo this end the open boundary was placed at x = -40km, with the closed boundary at x = \n40km.  In initial calculations (Table 1) the vertical temperature gradient was as previously, \n 18\ncorresponding to N = 0.01 s-1.  A detailed analysis of the flow in the Loch Etive calculations \n(not presented) showed that the sin (\u03c9t) forcing produced a weak long term residual flow.  \nAlthough this was not significant in short (2 tidal cycle) calculations to avoid it in the long \nterm calculations with the symmetric sill, the forcing was of the form \nU = F(t)Uo cos\u03c9t. \nHere the ramping function F(t) was used to increase tidal forcing at the open boundary.  In \nessence F(t) increased exponentially from 0 to 1 over a tidal period, after which it was \nconstant at F(t) = 1. \n Considering initially Clac 3 (Table 1), as in the Loch Etive calculation during the first \ntidal cycle, as the tidal velocity above the sill increases, isotherms on the left hand side of the \nsill upwell, (as in Fig. 2a) and there is advection over the sill.  This upwelling and advection \nof the temperature field over the sill is evident in the time series at x = 0 (centre of the sill) \ngiven in Fig. 6a.  On the lee side of the sill, the cross sill flow impinges on a water body at \nrest, and flows down the lee side of the sill with an associated depression of the isotherms.  \nAs the flow reverses at about t = 0.3T (Fig. 6a), this depression of the isotherms is swept back \nover the sill although the isotherms over the sill remain elevated from their initial position.  \nFollowing an initial \u201cspin up\u201d period of one tidal cycle, a nearly uniform barotropic tidal \ncycle is established with rapid fluctuations of the isotherms at x = 0 at times following tidal \nreverse (see temperature time series in Fig. 6a).  These fluctuations are associated with \nhydraulic transitions which occur at about x = \u00b1400 m (as in Fig. 2a) and are subsequently \nadvected onto the sill as the tide reverses.  With the present topography and tidal forcing the \nM2 component of the tidal velocity at x = 0, is a maximum at t = nT, with n an integer.  In \naddition higher harmonics of the tide are generated, leading to an increase in tidal velocity \nprior to t = nT , and decrease just after (Fig. 6a).  However, in order to examine the influence \nof small scale topography upon the flow and temperature distributions we will examine them \n 19\nat two times namely, at t = 8\/8T (namely t = T, the end of the first tidal cycle) (short time \nscale mixing) and 7T (the end of the seventh tidal cycle) (longer time scale), namely at times \nclose to maximum cross sill velocity.  By considering t = 7T, the longer term influence of \nsmall scale topography upon the solution can be determined. \n Temperature contours at t = T, show (Fig. 7a) the presence of density inversions and \nenhanced mixing in the region of the sill.  These are due to the hydraulic transition that \noccurs on the lee side of the sill  with associated wave breaking and shear instabilities \nproduced by the jet that separates from the sill.  As previously (Fig. 2a) in the lower half of \nthe water column the flow is near zero.  Close to the sill the u-current amplitude shows \nregions of surface intensification associated with lee waves that are evident in the vertical \nvelocity field (Fig. 7a).  The time series at x = 500 m (Fig. 6b) reveals the generation and \npropagation of lee waves at this point during times of maximum tidal current.  Based on the \nlocal water depth h = 60 m with N = 0.01 s-1, Fr = \u03c0U\/hN \u2248 3 for U of order 0.6 m s \u20131 \ncorresponding to the maximum cross sill velocity.  This shows that Fr exceeds 1 as far as \n\u00b1500 m away from the sill crest, although as water depth increases and tidal velocity \ndecreases Fr falls below unity.  Hence the flow changes from super-critical to sub-critical via \nthe hydraulic transition in the region of the sill.  However, lee waves and the hydraulic \ntransition give rise to temperature spikes that can be advected beyond the sill region into \nareas where the flow is sub-critical.  Consequently the temperature time series at x = 500 m, \nwhere the flow is sub-critical (Fig. 6b) has similar characteristics to that given in Fig. 6a, \nalthough the vertical displacement and \u201cbounce back\u201d in the upper layers of the water column \nare not as strong and occur later in time.  This later occurrence suggests the displacement was \ngenerated upstream, near the sill break, and advected into the region.  In addition there is \nmore high frequency variation in the temperature record at times of flood tide due to the \npresence of lee waves (see u and w time series in Fig. 6b).  These were not present over the \n 20\nsill crest.  At ebb tide, lee waves were absent and isotherms in the surface layer showed little \ntime variation. \n The Richardson number plot at t = T, reveals (Fig. 8a) unstable regions (Ri < 0.25), on \nthe leeside of the sill where the u velocity \u201cjet\u201d Fig. 7a separates from it.  In addition away \nfrom the sill there are regions of convective overturning due to wave breaking and the \nassociated temperature inversions in the surface layer shown in Fig. 7a.  Also beyond this \nregion, from x = 800 m to 1500 m, there is an area of unstable Ri, (Ri < 0.25) at a depth of \nabout z = -30 m associated with the jet shown in Fig. 7a. \n On the longer time scale, namely at t = 7T, temperature contours (Fig. 7b) show that \nthere has been appreciable mixing in the sill region and at the depth of the jet (compare \ntemperature contours in Figs. 7a and 7b).  The extent of the mixing compared with the initial \nconditions is quantified in the DN distribution (Fig. 7c).  The presence of mid-water mixing \noutside the sill region leads to a weak vertical temperature gradient between z = -10 to \u201340 m, \nalthough a sharper gradient in the surface layer and below this mid-water region is present.  \nThis mid-water mixing is an example of \u201cinternal mixing\u201d as defined by Van Haren and \nHowarth (2004).  The weaker vertical density gradient in the sill region reduces N, giving for \nthe same U value an increase in Fr, and hence stronger lee waves than found previously \n(compare w in Figs. 7a and 7b).  In addition the intensity of the current jet increases, \ncompared to previously (see Figs. 7a,b).  This increase in current together with the change in \nvertical stratification gives rise to two unstable regions (Ri < 0.25) on either side of the \nweakly stratified layer centred at about z = -40 m between x = 700 m and 1500 m (Fig. 8b).  \nThese two unstable regions led to enhanced mixing in the central region of the water column \nas time progresses. \n Time series of temperature and u velocity (Calc 3, Table 1) over tidal cycles 6 to 8 \n(namely t = 6T and 8T) at x = 0 (Fig. 6c), exhibit similar features to those found in the first \n 21\ntwo tidal cycles (compare Figs. 6a and 6c).  In particular there is a rapid vertical displacement \nof the near surface isotherms very close to the start of flood and ebb tide.  In essence the \ndisplacement occurs at about 0.05T after the start of flood or ebb tide.  However, except for \nthe near bed region, the water column is well mixed below this surface layer.  The u velocity \nexhibits a sinusoidal variation with no indication of lee waves, which were also absent in the \nvertical velocity time series.  The cross sill velocity had a shorter flood than ebb time, \nindicating the presence of higher harmonics generated at the sill.  This is consistent with the \nobservations of Inall et al. (2004, 2005) who reported finding higher harmonics.  By using the \nfree surface form of the MIT model, the sea surface elevation over the sill can respond to \nconvergences and divergences in the flow field in regions of changing topography.  These \nconvergences\/divergences give rise to increases\/decreases in sea surface elevation.  At x = \n500 m, time series (Fig. 6d) show significantly stronger lee waves reflecting the reduced \nstratification found at mid-depth (see temperature time series) and associated increase in Fr \ncompared to initially (Fig. 6b).  This arises because reducing N, diminishes the buoyancy \nrestoring force, thereby allowing for an increase in lee wave amplitude.  The effect of \nchanges in buoyancy is considered later in the paper. \n This calculation (Calc 3, Table 1) clearly shows that the mixing produced in the \nvicinity of the symmetric sill is comparable to that found with idealized Loch Etive \ntopography.  In addition the calculations reveal that on the longer time scale the internal \nmixing leads to an appreciable reduction in stratification in the region where flow separation \noccurs, and downstream of the separation point.  In the next series of calculations (namely \nCalcs 4 to 6, Table 1) the influence of small-scale topography upon this is examined.  As \npreviously this topography had a length scale of 100 m and height of order 5m.  In essence by \nadding small scale topography the local tidal excursion parameter RL taken as the ratio of \ntidal excursion (of order 10 km) to local small scale topography (of order 100 m) is \n 22\nsignificantly increased compared to the \u201csmooth\u201d sill case.  As RL is a measure of the non-\nlinearity of the solution, then some change in local lee wave generation is to be expected. \n4.2 Additional of small scale (rippled) topography to the upper part of the sill slope (Calc \n 4) \n The addition of small scale rippled topography (Calc 4, Table 1, see Fig. 9a) as often \nfound on sills or banks (e.g. Klymak and Gregg 2001, Nash and Moum 2001) initially (t = 0 \nto 0.4 T), has little influence on the temperature or velocity time series at x = 0 (compare \nFigs. 10a and 6a).  However, after about 0.4 T (5 hrs) when the tidal flow has reversed, the \ntemperature signal (Fig. 10a) shows small-scale ripples.  Based on a background barotropic \ntidal velocity of on average 10 cm s-1, by this time the temperature field from the left side of \nthe sill has been advected over the sill and back to x = 0.  Consequently any effect of the \nsmall-scale topography on either side of the sill will appear in the x = 0 time series.  In \nsubsequent cycles, particularly the ebb tide cycle between t = 1.2T and 1.8T there is a \nsignificant departure of the isotherms from those found previously (compare Figs. 10a and \n6a), suggesting an increase in mixing due to the presence of small scale topography.  This \nincrease in mixing on the lee side of the sill is evident in the spatial distribution of upper \nwater column isotherms (compare Figs. 7a and 9a).  The enhanced mixing leads to a \nreduction in N in the sill region, with an associated increase in Fr, based on local sill velocity, \nwater depth and value of N.  In addition an enhancement in lee wave amplitude compared to \npreviously occurs, as shown in the vertical velocity contours (Figs. 7a and 9a).  Also the near \nsurface current velocity increases, with regions of enhanced u velocity due to the presence of \nlee waves (Fig. 9a).  This increase in lee wave activity is evident in the time series at x = 500 \nm (Fig. 10b).  Compared to previously (Fig. 6b) it is apparent (Fig. 10b), that the lee waves \nare more energetic (note differences in scales between Figs. 6b and 10b) and have a shorter \nperiod, reflecting the enhanced mixing due to the presence of small scale topography.  In \n 23\naddition the reduction in N gives rise to an increase in Fr.  This increases in lee wave and \ncurrent velocity amplitude increases the lateral extent of the surface layer of unstable Ri \nnumber (compare Figs. 11 and 8a). \n The enhancement of mixing in the sill region produced by the small scale rippled \ntopography, on the longer time scale (t = 7T) gives rise in the sill region to a well mixed \nupper water column (Fig.9b,c).  Away from the sill, enhanced mid-water mixing gives rise to \na homogeneous water column, centred at about z = \u201320 m, approximately the depth at which \nthe u current jet leaves the sill (Fig. 9b).  In the surface layer, this mid-water mixing produces \na thin stratified near surface layer.  It is clearly evident from a comparison of DN \ndistributions (Fig. 7c and 9c) on the long term (t = 8T) that the presence of ripples on the \nupper part of the slope has substantially increased mixing in the upper half of the water \ncolumn.  However at depth, away from the slope there is no substantial difference in \nstratification.  In addition the effect of the ripples is to increase lee wave intensity and the \nextent of their downstream distribution (compare Figs. 7b and 9b). \n This calculation (Calc 4, Table 1) suggests that small scale topography in the upper \npart of the sill, where the current separates from the sill, will appreciably enhance vertical \nmixing.  The extent to which topography at depth influences mixing is examined in a \nsubsequent calculation. \n4.3 Addition of small scale (rippled) topography to the lower part of the sill slope (Calc 5) \n The presence of ripples on the lower sill slope region (Calc 5, Table 1) only had a \nsmall effect upon the near surface temperature distribution, compared to the smooth \ntopography solution (Fig. 7a).  However, at depth in the region of the topography some small-\nscale displacements of the isotherms not found previously occurred. \n4.4 Influence of small-scale variations in upper sill slope small-scale topography (Calc 6) \n 24\n To examine to what extent the mixing on the lee side of the sill was influenced by \nsmall changes in upper slope topography Calc 4 was repeated using the same sinusoidal \ndistribution of topography, but shifted in space by 180\u00b0 (Clac 6, Table 1).  By this means a \nsmall \u201cbump\u201d rather than \u201cdip\u201d (Fig. 9a) appeared on the upper part of the slope.   \n At t = 7T both calculations 4 and 6 show a well-mixed surface layer on the lee side of \nthe sill, extending to x = 1300 m, where there is a surface front (Fig. 9b).  Beyond this there \nis mid-water mixing below a stratified surface layer.  Stratification at depth is comparable in \nboth cases.  In addition the u current distributions at t = 7T, are not substantially different. \n This and previous calculations clearly show that small-scale topography on the upper \npart of the slope significantly influences mixing on the lee side of the sill.  However the exact \ndistribution of the small scale topography does not have an appreciable influence on the \nsolution. \n5. INFLUENCE OF SILL WIDTH \n5.1 Constant N (Calc 7) \n In the previous series of calculations the symmetric sill\u2019s width corresponded to that \nof Loch Etive.  In addition the influence of small-scale rippled topography upon sill mixing \nwas examined.  This section considers the extent to which sill width, and hence larger scale \ntopography influences mixing.  The model domain, tidal forcing, sill depth and water depth \nwere as previously, although the sill width was reduced from 1500 m to 500 m (Fig. 12a).  In \nan initial calculation (Calc 7, Table 1) with this reduced sill width, N = 0.01 s-1, as in the \nwider sill calculations.  Since the tidal forcing velocity remained as previously, then the tidal \nexcursion remained at 10 km, but the tidal excursion parameter RL increased by a factor of \nthree.  Also the sill slope is increased significantly. Therefore the combination of these two \nfactors increases the non-linearity and  an increase of lee waves is to be expected. \n 25\n Although a narrow sill case, and the influence of stratification upon the internal wave \nfield was briefly considered in XD06b, this was only in terms of a \u201csnap shot\u201d of the \ntemperature and vertical velocity field. Here, that work is extended to examine changes in the \ninternal wave field on both the short and long time scale. In addition time series are presented \ntogether with Richardson number distributions in order to examine to what extent sill width \nand vertical stratification influences the internal wave field and associated mixing. \nOn the short time scale, namely first tidal cycle, the temperature and velocity time \nseries on the top of the sill (x = 0), (Fig. 13a) are in close agreement with those found for the \nwide sill (Fig. 6a).  However, the smaller lateral extent of the sill means that the sill\u2019s slope is \nenhanced, giving rise to a more rapid temporal and spatial fluctuation of the temperature \nfield, as the flow accelerates over the sill.  This is evident in the rapid time variation of the \n12\u00b0 isotherm in Fig. 13a as the tide reverses.  Also the smaller extent of the sill width, leads \nto a more rapid downwelling of the density surfaces, and stronger hydraulic transition on the \nlee side of the sill.  This stronger transition produces the near vertical temperature profile at t \n= T at x = 900 m on the right hand side of the sill (Fig. 12a).  On the sill side of this, namely \nbetween x = 0 and 900 m, is a region of intense mid-water mixing produced by convective \noverturning and associated wave breaking.  Additional mixing is produced by shear \ninstability due to the jet that separates from the top of the sill (Fig. 12a).  Although the mid-\nwater mixing produces a near homogeneous water column between z = -10 m and \u201340 m, \nbetween x = 500 and 800 m, it leads to a significantly stronger near surface temperature \ngradient.  The intensity of this mixing, the associated lee waves and current jet are enhanced \ncompared to previously (compare Figs. 7a and 12a).  The increased intensity and shorter \nperiod of the lee waves produced with the narrow sill are evident in the time series at x = 500 \nm (Fig. 13b) compared to the wider sill (Fig. 6b).  The spatial extent of the region of \nenhanced mixing is clearly evident from the Ri number distribution, with Ri < 0 implying \n 26\nconvective instability.  A region of unstable Ri number (Ri < 0.25) extending from the sill, up \nto x = 800 m, and from z = -10 m to \u2013 30 m on the lee side of the sill occurs at t = T (Fig. \n14a).  In this area there is intense vertical mixing, which is appreciably larger than in the wide \nsill case (compare Figs. 8a and 14a). \n The enhanced mixing, increased intensity of the u current jet, and enhanced lee wave \ndistribution on the lee side of the narrow sill, on the longer time scale (t = 7T) compared with \nthe wide sill is evident from a comparison of Figs. 7b and 12b.  On this longer time scale it is \napparent that the more abrupt transition from super-critical to sub-critical flow across the \nnarrow sill produces an enhanced hydraulic transition compared with the wide sill case.  This \nenhanced transition arises from the larger \u2202h\/\u2202x term, with the corresponding increased non-\nlinearity giving rise to a stronger lee wave signal, and current jet.  Associated with the \nhydraulic transition and current jet is an increase in convective overturning and shear \ninstability giving enhanced internal mixing compared to the wide sill case.  The appreciable \nincrease in mixing between the two sill cases (narrow and wide) at t =7T, is evident from a \ncomparison of Figs. 8b and 14b.  This increased mixing, reduces N, leading to an increase in \nFr and amplitude of lee waves.  In this calculation N was constant in the vertical.  However, \nin many loch and fjord systems there is a layer of freshwater at the surface (Inall et al. 2004, \n2005), giving in essence a two-layer system.  The extent to which this influences mixing in \nthe narrow sill case is examined in the next calculation. \n5.2 Vertically varying N. \n5.2.1 N1 = 0.02 s-1, N2 = 0.01 s-1 (Calc 8) \n To examine the influence of adding a strongly stratified surface layer with buoyancy \nfrequency N1 = 0.02 s-1, and thickness h1 = 20 m the previous calculation was repeated (Calc \n8, Table 1) with this additional layer.  At depth, the same stratification as previously, namely \nN2 = 0.01 s-1 was applied.  The effect of increasing the buoyancy in the surface layer which \n 27\nintersects the top of the sill, is to oppose the displacement of the temperature surfaces on the \nlee of the sill.  In addition the Fr number on the top of the sill is reduced to half that when N = \n0.01 s-1. Consequently the hydraulic transition is reduced with an associated reduction in \nconvective overturning and mixing in the upper part of the water column compared to \npreviously (compare Figs. 15a and 12b).  In addition the amplitude and lateral extent of the \nlee waves formed on the downstream side of the sill are reduced compared to those found \npreviously, as shown by the vertical velocity distributions in Figs. 15a and 12b. \n However, on the lee side of the sill, a current jet and flow separation still occurs but at \nz = -40 m (deeper than previously) and about the position of the transition between the two \nlayers (Fig. 15a).  Associated with this jet is a downstream region of shear instability with Ri \n< 0.25 and enhanced mixing (Fig. 15b).  The width of this mixing region, and the intensity of \nthe mixing within it, is appreciably smaller than previously (compare Figs. 15b and 14b).  \nThis mixing leads to a reduction in temperature gradient near the base of the surface layer in \nthe sill region, but to an increase in temperature gradient in the interface region between top \nand bottom layers.  Vertical velocity contours and time series at various locations did not \nshow any appreciable lee wave signal away from the top of the sill. \n This suggests that the N value in the layer which intersects the upper part of the sill \ncontrols the magnitude of the hydraulic transition and associated convective mixing.  \nIncreasing this value, decreases Fr in the upper water column with an associated decrease in \nlee waves.  However the shear instability due to the jet that separates from the sill remains \nand enhances mixing at depth, downstream from the sill. \n5.2.2 N1 = 0.01 s-1, N2 = 0.005 s-1 (Calc9) \n Repeating the calculation with N1 = 0.01 s-1 and N2 = 0.005 s-1 (Calc 9, Table 1), \ngives a surface distribution of temperature on the lee side of the sill comparable to that found \n 28\nwith constant N = 0.01 s-1 (compare Figs. 12b and 16a).  Similarly the u current distribution, \nshows a jet leaving the upper part of the sill as found previously with N = 0.01 s-1. \n This confirms, as found previously, that the buoyancy in the surface layer is the \nprimary factor controlling the downstream hydraulic transition, current jet and hence mixing.  \nThis suggests that a local sill Froude number based on sill velocity, water depth and \nstratification is more critical than one computed with total water depth and mean buoyancy.  \nThe reduced value of N at depth does have some effect on the lee wave distribution, the \namplitude and downstream propagation of which increases as N2 is reduced.  The reduced \nbuoyancy frequency in the lower part of the water column, together with the enhanced lee \nwave amplitude, leads on the longer time scale to a reduction in Ri number in the lower half \nof the water column compare to N = 0.01 s-1.  However, the Richardson number distribution \nin the upper part of the water column (compare Figs. 14b and 16b) is comparable to that \nfound with N = 0.01 s-1. \n6. CONCLUDING REMARKS \n A non-hydrostatic model of tidal flow over idealized topography representing the sill \nat the entrance to a loch or fjord has been used to investigate the influence of small scale \nrippled topography upon internal waves in the sill region.  In addition the effect of sill width \nand hence sill slope upon the generation of the internal tide and its higher harmonics was also \nexamined.  In a final series of calculations the extent to which the profile of buoyancy \ninfluences the mixing was considered. \n Initially tidal flow over idealized smooth topography representing the sill at the \nentrance to Loch Etive was used.  Short time scale calculations (of the order of two tidal \ncycles) showed that the model could reproduce the major observed (Inall et al. 2004, 2005) \nfeatures of the flow, internal lee wave generation and mixing in the region.  Hence, although \nidealized topography and a cross section model were used, it could account for the major \n 29\nobserved processes in sill regions.  In a subsequent series of calculations, small scale \ntopographic \u201cripples\u201d were added to the steeper side of the sill, where observations had been \nmade (Inall et al. 2004, 2005).  This had the effect of appreciably influencing mixing on the \nlee side of the sill.  Since this mixing occurs at the level of the thermocline, in essence \n\u201cinternal mixing\u201d (Van Haren and Howarth 2004) rather than \u201cexternal mixing\u201d as in wind \nforced surface turbulence it has an appreciable influence upon across thermocline exchange. \n The main problem with these initial calculations was that the model domain was \nsmall, since it had been chosen to represent Loch Etive.  To enable a more detailed analysis \nof longer term mixing and energy distribution to be performed the model domain was \nextended.  In addition a symmetric sill was used so that the influence of sill width could be \nconsidered.  Calculations using a wide sill, initially without and subsequently with various \nsmall scale topographic ripples, showed that small scale topography on the upper slope of the \nsill enhanced the long term mixing.  Small scale topography on the lower half of the slope \nhad a marginal effect upon the mixing.  As the sill width was reduced, mixing below the \nsurface layer significantly increased above that found with the wide sill.  These calculations \nshowed that not only did sill width control the mixing, but small scale ripples on a wide sill \nappreciably enhanced the local mixing. \n Subsequent calculations with the narrow sill and vertical stratification representing a \ntwo layer situation (e.g. a fresh surface layer above a stratified bottom layer), showed that \nupper layer buoyancy had a major effect upon the intensity of the hydraulic transition.  In \naddition it influenced the magnitude of lee waves.  This reduction in hydraulic transition \nintensity and lee wave magnitude as N increased in the surface layer led to a decrease in \nmixing in the lee of the sill. \n These calculations which are summarised in Table 1 clearly show that sill width as \ndemonstrated from the comparison of Calcs 3 and 7 (Table 1), on both the short and long \n 30\ntime scale, influences mixing on the lee side of the sill. This arises because as sill width is \ndecreased then for a given across sill velocity Us, the ratio of tidal excursion to topographic \nlength scale increases. As shown this leads to an increase in the non-linear nature of the \nproblem with a corresponding increase in mixing. For a given sill half width (Calc 3), the \naddition of rippled topography to the upper part of the sill (Calc 4) clearly influences \nmidwater mixing on the lee side of the sill. This is because small scale topography in this \nregion, where flow separation occurs and lee waves are generated, influences the lateral \nextent of the region of unstable Ri number. This change in the area of unstable Ri number \nleads to enhanced vertical mixing. For the case in which the small scale topography is added \nto the lower part of the sill (Calc 5, Table 1), because this is well removed from the area of \ncurrent separation or lee wave generation it has no significant influence upon the mixing. In \naddition from a detailed comparison of Calcs 4 and 6, the exact form of the topography on the \nupper part of the sill does not appreciable influence mixing. Additional calculations with a \nsmooth narrow sill (Calcs 7 to 9, Table 1) clearly show that stratification in the upper layer \nhas a greater influence upon mixing than that at depth.   \nThis series of calculations clearly shows that if a model has a coarse grig in the region \nof a narrow sill such as that used here in calculations 7 to 9, then the ratio of tidal excursion \nto topographic length scale will be artificially reduced resulting in a decrease in vertical \nmixing. This suggests that to compensate for this it will be necessary to enhance vertical \nmixing in such models on the lee side of sills. \nEven when the grid is sufficiently fine to resolve the sill, calculations 3 to 6, suggest \nthat if such a grid cannot resolve small scale topography on the sill sides, particularly that on \nthe upper part of the sill slope, then again vertical mixing will have to be enhanced in the sill \nregion.  Besides having implications for the development of numerical models, these results \nhave some implications for the design of experimental programmes. In particular they \n 31\nsuggest that besides precise current and mixing measurements of the form made by Inall et al. \n(2004, 2005) on the lee side of Loch Etive, detailed measurements of small scale topography \nand stratification in the upper part of the sill and the adjacent water column are required for \nrigorous model validation.  In essence, existing data sets are not sufficiently comprehensive \nto allow for a rigorous skill assessment of simulation models to be performed.  To permit \nsuch quantitative comparisons more comprehensive data sets need to be collected, which will \ncontain details of the small scale variations in bottom topography. \nAcknowledgements \n The authors are indebted to the reviewers for their constructive comments and L Parry \nand E.
