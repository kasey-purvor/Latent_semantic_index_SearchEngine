The results are used to test two shell-model frameworks with different pictures\nof the evolution of single-proton energies along the N = 28 isotones near the neutron dripline. We observe\na concentration of d5\/2 proton hole strength near 1 MeV in excitation energy. This result favors the recent\nshell-model interaction of Utsuno et al. [Eur. Phys. J. Spec. Top. 150, 187 (2007)] and provides additional\nevidence for an oblate shape for 42Si.\nDOI: 10.1103\/PhysRevC.78.011303 PACS number(s): 24.50.+g, 21.10.Jx, 25.60.Gc, 27.40.+z\nThe nuclei in the vicinity of 42Si have served as both\na frontier for our understanding of the evolution of shell\nstructure near the neutron dripline and a proving ground for the\nexperimental techniques that will be used at the next generation\nof radioactive beam facilities. Whether major shell closures\nand magic numbers change at the neutron dripline and affect\nnuclear deformation is an open question that has generated\na great deal of activity, and 42Si has both N = 28\u2014a major\nshell closure in stable nuclei\u2014and a proton subshell closure\n(Z = 14) [1\u20133]. In addition to the N = 28 major shell closure\nbeing the lightest caused by the spin-orbit interaction, nuclei\nin the vicinity of 42Si are among the heaviest isotopes near the\nneutron dripline that are accessible by the present generation\nof radioactive beam facilities, making them the best currently\navailable subjects for the study of changing shell structure near\nthe neutron dripline.\nWith new radioactive beam facilities being planned and\nconstructed, there has been a tremendous effort to develop\nexperimental tools that will allow detailed spectroscopic study\nof exotic isotopes produced at these new facilities. One of these\ntools is the one-nucleon knockout reaction with intermediate-\nenergy beams. An effort to correlate cross sections measured\nwith this reaction with theoretical cross sections, combining\nshell-model spectroscopic factors and single-particle cross\nsections from eikonal theory, is underway [4,5]. Analysis of\nthe reaction presented here contributes to this effort. In the\npresent Rapid Communication, we report on the use of the\none-proton knockout reaction from 44S to locate and quantify\nproton spectroscopic strength from the d5\/2 orbit in 43P, which\nis one proton heavier than 42Si. We find a concentration\nof d5\/2 proton hole strength near 1 MeV in excitation\nenergy. This observation is reproduced by using shell-model\ncalculations performed with the recently developed interaction\nof Utsuno et al. [6], which in turn supports an oblate shape for\n42Si.\nThe experiment was performed at the Coupled-Cyclotron\nFacility of the National Superconducting Cyclotron Labora-\ntory at Michigan State University. The 44S beam was produced\nby fragmentation of a 140 MeV\/nucleon 48Ca primary beam\nincident on a 705 mg\/cm2 9Be fragmentation target. The\nfragmentation products were separated in the A1900 fragment\nseparator [7]. The secondary 44S beam, with a purity of 81%\nand primary contaminant 45Cl, was incident on a 376 mg\/cm2\nthick 9Be reaction target mounted at the target position of the\nS800 magnetic spectrograph [8]. The mid-target beam energy\nwas 91.7 MeV\/nucleon. A total of 9.3 \u00d7 108 incoming 44S\nparticles were well separated from contaminants by time of\nflight in scintillators mounted at the extended focal plane\nof the A1900 and at the object of the S800 analysis line.\nProjectile-like reaction products were identified by time of\nflight at the focal plane of the S800 and energy loss in the\nS800 ion chamber. The Segmented Germanium Array (SeGA)\n[9] of 32-fold segmented high-purity germanium detectors was\nused to detect \u03b3 rays emitted by excited reaction products.\nThe projectile-frame energy spectrum of \u03b3 rays measured in\ncoincidence with 44S beam particles and outgoing 43P particles\nis shown in Fig. 1. A source velocity of \u03b2 = 0.405 was used\nin the event-by-event Doppler correction of \u03b3 -ray energies\nmeasured in the laboratory frame. GEANT3 [10] simulations\nof the response of SeGA to \u03b3 rays were used to extract\ntotal \u03b3 -ray intensities from the measured spectrum. The\nmeasured spectrum was fitted with a linear combination of the\nsimulated responseof the observed \u03b3 rays, the measured room\nbackground, and two exponential functions by using a log-\nlikelihood maximization procedure. The exponential functions\nwere included to account for the empirically observed prompt\n0556-2813\/2008\/78(1)\/011303(5) 011303-1 \u00a92008 The American Physical Society\nRAPID COMMUNICATIONS\nL.

In addition to the known [2,3] 184(1)-keV\n\u03b3 ray de-exciting the J\u03c0 = 32\n+ first excited state, six other \u03b3\nrays are prominent in the spectrum at 661(4), 765(6), 825(5),\n911(6), 1018(6), and 1851(11) keV. The 825- and 911-keV\n\u03b3 rays likely correspond to the 789(29)- and 918(26)-keV \u03b3\nrays seen in the fragmentation study of Ref. [3]. In addition, the\nfitting process revealed that the peak at 825 keV is a doublet,\ncontaining a weak 845(4)-keV component.\nGamma-ray spectra measured in coincidence with the 184-\nand 825-keV \u03b3 rays are shown in the top and bottom panels\nFIG. 2.

The 661-, 825-, 911-, and 1851-keV \u03b3 rays appear\nin the 184-keV gate spectrum. We observe no coincidences\nbetween these \u03b3 rays, so we place them directly atop the\n184-keV J\u03c0 = 32\n+ first excited state in the proposed level\nscheme in Fig. 3. Although the apparent photopeak at 1018 keV\nin the 825-keV gate spectrum is not statistically significant, we\ntentatively place the 1018-keV transition above the 1009-keV\nstate based on the energy difference between the 1009- and\n2035-keV levels.\nAn inclusive single-proton knockout cross section \u03c3inc =\n9.6(8) mb to bound final states of 43P was determined from\nthe number of outgoing 43P reaction products relative to the\nnumber of incoming 44S beam particles and the particle density\nof the reaction target. The uncertainty in the inclusive cross\nsection includes the stability of the incoming beam (8%),\nthe correction for the momentum acceptance of the S800\n(3%), and the software gates used to select the reaction of\ninterest (1%).

The curves are theoretical distribu-\ntions, described in the text, for l = 0 (dashed)\nand l = 2 (solid).\nsection from the present experiment is in agreement with that\nobtained in the earlier one-proton knockout measurement of\nFridmann et al. [2]. The prior measurement was made with\na reaction target of the same thickness but with a factor of\n85 fewer beam particles. In the prior work, only the 184-keV\ntransition was observed at a level of 75(15)% of the inclusive\ncross section. If we do not correct for feeding from higher\nlying states, the knockout branching ratio of the 184-keV level\nfrom the present work is 73(4)%, in excellent agreement with\nthe earlier result.\nParallel momentum distributions of 43P reaction residues in\nthe ground state and the strongly populated excited states at\n184, 1009, and 1095 keV are shown in Fig. 4. The excited-state\ndistributions were obtained by gating on the de-excitation \u03b3\nrays identified at the upper right in each panel in the figure.\nThe distribution of the first excited state was corrected for\nfeeding by the 825- and 911-keV transitions based on the\nmeasured \u03b3 -ray intensities. The ground-state distribution was\nobtained with a linear combination of distributions measured\nin coincidence and in anticoincidence with \u03b3 rays as described\nin Ref. [11].\nThe curves in Fig. 4 are eikonal-model calculations pro-\nduced by using the method described in Ref. [5]. The incoming\nbeam was not monoenergetic, so the measured momentum\ndistribution of the unreacted 44S beam has been folded into\nthe theoretical distributions. In addition, the incoming 44S\nbeam particles lose more energy per unit target thickness than\nthe 43P reaction products. In our measurement, the different\nenergy losses of incoming and outgoing particles contributed\n\u0005p\np\n= 0.8% to the momentum spread of the 43P particles. A\nrectangular distribution of this width has also been folded into\nthe theoretical distributions.\nThe dashed curves in Fig. 4 correspond to removal of a\nproton with orbital angular momentum l = 0 and separation\nenergy 22.2 MeV, and the solid curves correspond to l = 2.\nThe measured distributions show a small asymmetry, having\nlow momentum \u201ctails.\u201d This phenomenon has been observed\nin several cases [11\u201314]. Except for very weakly bound\nsystems [15], it is not well understood, but it is thought to\narise from a dissipative mechanism not accounted for by\neikonal theory [13]. To avoid bias from the low-momentum\ntails, we have fitted the theoretical distributions in Fig. 4\nto the measured cross sections above 17.4 GeV\/c. Above\nthis value, the momentum distributions of the three excited\nstates are compatible with l = 2 and the ground state with\nl = 0 distributions. These l assignments suggest a \u03c0s1\/2\nconfiguration in the ground state and \u03c0d3\/2 configuration for\nthe first excited state, compatible with prior J\u03c0 assignments\nof 1\/2+ and 3\/2+ to these states. The assignment of l = 2 to\nthe excited states at 1009 and 1095 keV, along with energies\nsignificantly above the first excited state, is consistent with\ntheir interpretation as arising from the removal of a proton\nfrom the more deeply bound d5\/2 proton orbital in 44S.\nAs described in Ref.

These experiments demonstrate that the classical\nsingle-particle model picture of fully occupied, deeply bound\nsingle-particle states requires modification because of several\ncorrelation effects. These correlation effects are quantified\nwith a \u201creduction factor\u201d Rs obtained from experimental and\ntheoretical inclusive knockout cross sections via [4]\nRs =\n\u03c3 incexp\u2211\nnJ\u03c0\n\u03c3th(nJ\u03c0 )\n, (2)\nwhere the sum includes all shell-model states below the\nnucleon separation energy. Single-nucleon knockout studies\nhave mapped the systematics of the dependence of the required\nreduction on the difference between the energies of the\nneutron and proton Fermi surfaces. In a recent article, Gade\net al. [17] present a plot of reduction factors from several\nsingle-nucleon knockout studies versus the difference \u0005S in\nproton and neutron separation energies; their plot shows a\nwell-defined systematic dependence. In short, the reduction\nfactor is small (with observed values as low as 0.25) when the\nknocked-out nucleon is tightly bound and large (approaching\n1.0) when the knocked-out nucleon is loosely bound. For\n44S, the incident exotic nucleus in the present study, \u0005S is\n17(1) MeV. A weighted least-squares fit to the reduction factor\nplot in Ref. [17] with this difference in binding energies gives\nRs = 0.33(3) for the present proton knockout reaction. This\nis identical to the result reported in the following, which we\nobtain from Eq. (2).\nIn the upper left panel of Fig. 5, measured cross sections\nfor the states in 43P observed here, and believed to have J\u03c0 =\n5\/2+, are shown in bins corresponding to 250-keV intervals\nin excitation energy. Two sets of shell-model calculations [18]\nwere combined with the eikonal single-particle cross sections\nvia Eq. (1) to calculate the theoretical cross sections shown in\nthe two lower right panels of the figure. The first set, labeled\nNowacki-01 (lower panel), is performed with the interaction\nused in Ref. [19] in which the effective spin-orbit \u03c0d3\/2-\u03c0d5\/2\nsplitting is 5.9 MeV in 48Ca and 6.6 MeV in 42Si. In the second\nset, labeled Utsuno-08 (center panel), we show results based\non a new effective interaction for this mass region, described\nin Refs. [20] and [6], that takes into account some empirical\ntrends observed for the effective central and tensor components\nof the interactions for the sd [21] and pf [22,23] shells.\nFor Utsuno-08 the effective \u03c0d3\/2-\u03c0d5\/2 spin-orbit splitting is\n5.2 MeV in 48Ca and 6.5 MeV in 42Si.

The\nplots on the left show spectroscopic factors summed as a function of\nexcitation energy up to 6 MeV for each spin.\nhave been scaled by the reduction factorRs = 0.33(3) obtained\nby using Eq. (2) when using the theoretical cross sections\nbased on the shell-model calculations with the Utsuno-08\ninteraction. The error bars on the theoretical cross sections\nin the figure reflect the uncertainty in the reduction factor. The\nmain difference between the calculations based on the two\nshell-model interactions is that the Utsuno-08 gives more d5\/2\nstrength near 1.1 MeV, in better agreement with experiment.\nThe strength near 2 MeV is too large with both interactions.\nThis shows the sensitivity of these measurements to the\ninteractions. The right side of the figure shows the shell-model\nspectroscopic factors summed as a function of excitation\nenergy up to 6 MeV for each spin (which requires about\n50 states for each spin). The present experiment is sensitive\nto the strength below 3 MeV, which contains 51% (45%) of\nthe total sd-shell sum-rule strength of 8 with the Nowacki-01\n(Utsuno-08) interaction. The fraction of the sum rule up to\n6 MeV is 82% (76%). These results nicely show the large\nfractionation of spectroscopic strength that occurs in mid-shell\nnuclei and how its distribution reflects both the single-particle\nand collective properties of the nucleus.\nThe shape of 42Si has been the subject of considerable\ndiscussion during the past several years. At first, it was\nexpected that this nucleus would be spherical because of its\nneutron number, 28, which is magic along the line of stability,\nand its Z = 14 subshell closure. However, shell structure is\nmuch less certain near the neutron dripline, and the shape of\n42Si has been the topic of debate. Much of the discussion has\nbeen centered on the role of the neutron orbits in determining\nthe shape of 42Si and its neighbors. It was predicted [24,25]\n011303-4\nRAPID COMMUNICATIONS\nd5\/2 PROTON HOLE STRENGTH IN NEUTRON-RICH . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW C 78, 011303(R) (2008)\nthat the spin-orbit force affecting neutron orbits weakens close\nto the neutron dripline because of both the weak binding of\nneutrons and the role of the continuum. More specifically,\na number of authors have predicted that the N = 28 shell\nclosure narrows or even collapses as protons are removed\nfrom the doubly-magic nucleus 48Ca [26\u201333], causing the\ndeformation of 42Si. In contrast, it was argued in Ref. [34]\nthat the proton-subshell closure at Z = 14 would be a strong\nstabilizing influence, hindering deformation and maintaining\na spherical shape.\nThe accumulating experimental evidence on 42Si has\nnot yet fully clarified the situation. A measurement of the\n\u03b2 decay of 42Si was used to argue for a deformed shape for this\nnucleus [1], as was the observation that 43Si is bound [35]. The\nmeasurement of a small cross section for two-proton knockout\nfrom 44S was interpreted as evidence for the persistence of the\nZ = 14 subshell closure in 42Si, which would favor a spherical\nshape [2]. Mass measurements of Cl, S, and P isotopes in\nthe region [36] indicate a weakening of the N = 28 shell for\nZ > 14, but the mass measurement of 42Si [37] is inconclusive,\nthe result being consistent with either a spherical or deformed\nshape. Most recently, the fragmentation study of Bastin et al.\n[3] revealed a low-lying excited state of 42Si (presumed to\nhave J\u03c0 = 2+) at 770(19) keV, and inverse kinematics proton\nscattering from 40Si [38] showed a low 2+1 energy and enhanced\ncollectivity relative to mid-shell, both strongly suggestive\nof a reduced N = 28 shell gap and a deformed shape at\nZ = 14. The lowering of \u03c0d5\/2 strength is correlated with\na lowering of the 2+ energy in 42Si from 1.49 MeV with\nNowacki-01 to 0.87 MeV with Utsuno-08, to be compared\nwith the recent experimental value of 0.77 MeV [3]. The result\nreported here for the distribution of d5\/2 proton hole strength\nin 43P, with its agreement with the shell-model calculation of\nRef. [6], adds to the supporting evidence for an oblate shape in\n42Si.\nIn summary, we have reported on the use of the one-proton\nknockout reaction from 44S to identify d5\/2 proton hole strength\nin neutron-rich 43P. The results have been used to test two shell-\nmodel interactions, of which only one\u2014that of Ref. [6]\u2014can\nreproduce the concentration of d5\/2 strength near 1 MeV. This\nlends support to the growing evidence that 42Si has an oblate\nshape.\nThis work was supported by the National Science Founda-\ntion under Grant Nos.
