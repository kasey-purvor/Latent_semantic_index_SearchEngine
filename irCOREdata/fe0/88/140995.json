Introduction\nThe use of composite materials in aerospace structures is on the increase. One of their main\nweaknesses is low impact resistance and significant reduction of compressive strength caused by impact\nrelated damage. To develop simulation tools capable of modelling high velocity impacts (characteristic\nloading rates between 3 11 10 s\uf02d\uf0b4 and 8 11 10 s\uf02d\uf0b4 ) on composites it is necessary to understand the formation\nand propagation of shock waves in composite materials. This problem is complicated by the complexity\nof the composite material structure and by the fact that mechanical properties of composite materials are\ndependent on loading rates and material orientation2-4. The consequence of this is that the shock wave\nvelocity and state of stress behind the wave differ with material direction for identical impact cases.\nConstitutive models developed for modelling of shock wave propagation in solids comprise two\nparts, an equation of state (EOS) which defines the response of the material to uniform compression\n(change of volume) and a deviatoric model which defines the response of the material to shear\ndeformation (change of shape). The EOS controls the response of the material to shock loading. This\nseparation of material response into volumetric and deviatoric strain components is well suited for\nisotropic materials, where the spherical part of the stress tensor \/ 3ij ijkl kl ppP C\uf064 \uf064 \uf065\uf02d \uf03d , is a function only of\nthe spherical part of the strain tensor. Furthermore, the principal axes of the stress and strain tensors are\nco-linear. In other words, components of stress and strain are proportional to each other and\northogonality between the volumetric and deviatoric components of strain is reflected in orthogonality\n2between the volumetric and deviatoric components of stress. It is simple to show that the definition of\npressure as the average normal stress is the consequence of this orthogonality, i.e.\n\/ 3\n0\nij ij ij\nij ij kl kl\nij ij\nii\nkl kl\nij ij\nP S\nP\nP P\nS\n\uf073 \uf064\n\uf073 \uf064 \uf064 \uf064\n\uf073 \uf064 \uf073\n\uf064 \uf064\n\uf064\n\uf03d \uf02d \uf02b\n\uf03d \uf02d\n\uf03d \uf02d \uf0ae \uf03d \uf02d\n\uf03d\n(1)\nUsing this definition of pressure Hooke\u2019s law for isotropic materials can be expressed as\n2\n2 2\n3\nd\nij kk ij ij ij kk ij ij ijP S\uf073 \uf06c\uf065 \uf064 \uf06d\uf065 \uf06c \uf06d \uf064 \uf065 \uf06d\uf065 \uf064\n\uf0e6 \uf0f6\uf03d \uf02b \uf03d \uf02b \uf02b \uf03d \uf02d \uf02b\uf0e7 \uf0f7\uf0e8 \uf0f8\n(2)\nwhere ijS and\nd\nij\uf065 are the deviatoric parts of the stress and strain tensor respectively and,\uf06c and \uf06d\nare Lame parameters.\nThe conventional decomposition, equation (2) does not hold for orthotropic materials as both the\nspherical and deviatoric parts of the stress tensor each induce volumetric and deviatoric strain. Using this\nstandard decomposition to model shock propagation in orthotropic materials does not accurately predict\nthe material behaviour. The method for improvement of the relation between EOS and the isotropic state\nof strain for orthotropic materials proposed by Anderson1, who derived an expression for pressure as a\nfunction of the volumetric and deviatoric components of the strain tensor has been frequently used in\nhydrocodes.\nThis paper investigates two different stress decompositions for orthotropic materials applied to the\nmodelling of the propagation of shock waves in composite materials. In deriving the decompositions, one\nconstraint was that the proposed constitutive model would use existing types of shock equations of state\nand related material data derived from plate impact tests, e.g. 2-5. The proposed procedure is developed\nfor an incremental strain formulation within explicit time integration scheme. It is applicable to either\nfinite difference or finite element semi-discretisation.\n2. Constitutive stress - strain relationship for orthotropic materials\nThe relative simplicity in modelling the elastic behaviour in isotropic materials is a consequence\nof the fact that the material is fully characterized by two parameters. In the case of elastic orthotropic\nmaterials, nine parameters are required to define the stress strain relationship using either stiffness,\nequation (3), or compliance matrices - equation (4).\nij ijkl klC\uf073 \uf065\uf03d (3)\n1\nij ijkl kl ijkl klC B\uf065 \uf073 \uf073\uf02d\uf03d \uf03d (4)\nEquations (3,4) can be rewritten using Voigt notation as p pq qC\uf073 \uf065\uf03d and 1q pq p qp pC B\uf065 \uf073 \uf073\uf02d\uf03d \uf03d\nwhere (2 )q kl kl\uf065 \uf064 \uf065\uf03d \uf02d .

Alternative decomposition of stress tensor for orthotropic materials\nThe issue of the stress decomposition was considered by Anderson1 in relation to wave\npropagation in anisotropic materials. He demonstrates that for an anisotropic material pressure depends\nnot only on volumetric strain but also on the deviatoric strain components, therefore the decomposition\nused for isotropic materials is not applicable.\n\uf07b\n\uf05b \uf05d\uf07d\n\uf07b \uf07d\n\uf07b \uf07d\n1 23 32 2 13 31 3 12 21\n1 21 31 23 1 31 21 32 2 32 31 12\n1 23 32 1 21 31 23 1 31 21 32 11\n2 21 31 23 2 13 31 2 32 12 31 22\n1\n(1 ) (1 ) (1 )\n9\n2 ( ) ( ) ( )\n1\n(1 ) ( ) ( )\n3\n1\n( ) (1 ) ( )\n3\n1\n3\nd\nd\nP E E E\nE E E\nE E E\nE E E\nE\n\uf06e \uf06e \uf06e \uf06e \uf06e \uf06e\n\uf062\n\uf06e \uf06e \uf06e \uf06e \uf06e \uf06e \uf06e \uf06e \uf06e \uf065\n\uf06e \uf06e \uf06e \uf06e \uf06e \uf06e \uf06e \uf06e \uf065\n\uf062\n\uf06e \uf06e \uf06e \uf06e \uf06e \uf06e \uf06e \uf06e \uf065\n\uf062\n\uf062\n\uf03d\uf02d \uf02d \uf02b \uf02d \uf02b \uf02d \uf02b\n\uf02b \uf02b \uf02b \uf02b \uf02b \uf02b \uf02b\n\uf02b \uf02d \uf02b \uf02b \uf02b \uf02b \uf02b\n\uf02b \uf02b \uf02b \uf02d \uf02b \uf02b \uf02b\n\uf02b \uf07b \uf07d3 31 21 32 3 32 12 31 3 12 21 33( ) ( ) (1 ) dE E\uf06e \uf06e \uf06e \uf06e \uf06e \uf06e \uf06e \uf06e \uf065\uf02b \uf02b \uf02b \uf02b \uf02d\n(7)\nwhere 3221133123123223311321121 \uf06e\uf06e\uf06e\uf06e\uf06e\uf06e\uf06e\uf06e\uf06e\uf06e\uf06e\uf06e\uf062 \uf02d\uf02d\uf02d\uf02d\uf02d\uf03d and 11 22 33\uf065 \uf065 \uf065 \uf065\uf03d \uf02b \uf02b .\nThis approach does not accurately predict levels of stress behind a shock wave when modelling\northotropic materials when a shock equation of state is used. An example of this can be seen in the results\nshown in section 5.\nAs already stated, in the case of isotropic materials isotropic states of strain induce isotropic states\nof stress (pressure) and they are directly related through bulk modulus. An equivalent relationship cannot\nbe defined for orthotropic materials. If one maintains the assumption that pressure is the state of stress\ninduced by volumetric strain (uniform compression or expansion) then a more general definition of\npressure is required. This leads to a number of possible definitions of pressure as a vector in the principal\nstress space which, for orthotropic materials, does not coincide with the hydrostat. To explore this\nstatement further one can consider the following two possibilities.\n3.1 Decomposition 1 or \uf079 decomposition\nStress due to the isotropic component of strain (or isotropic strain pressure) is defined as\n\u02c6 \/ 3ij ijkl kl ss ijkk vP C C\uf079 \uf064 \uf065 \uf065\uf02d \uf03d \uf03d (8)\nWhere: 0 , 0ij iji j i j\uf079 \uf079\uf03d \uf022 \uf0b9 \uf0b9 \uf022 \uf03d , \/ 3v ss\uf065 \uf065\uf03d .\nFrom equation (8) parameter P\u02c6 and tensor ij\uf079 can be expressed as\n1\u02c6\nv ijkk ijll\nst st\nP C C\uf065\n\uf079 \uf079\n\uf02d \uf03d (9)\n\u02c6\/\n1\nijkk\nij ijkk v\nprkk prll\nst st\nC\nC P\nC C\n\uf079 \uf065\n\uf079 \uf079\n\uf03d \uf02d \uf03d (10)\nTo uniquely define P\u02c6 and tensor ij\uf079 it is necessary to define the double contraction st st\uf079 \uf079 .

The full source code for LLNL-DYNA3D is available at Cranfield through a\ncollaboration agreement with LLNL.\n4. Coupling of EOS with the proposed stress decompositions\nTo mathematically describe the propagation of strong shock waves in solids it is necessary to use\nan EOS in addition to the conservation laws. Basically, an EOS provides a relationship between pressure,\ndensity and internal energy. Hence, EOS represents a closure equation, which completes the relationships\nbetween the state variables in front of and behind a shockwave. The internal energy is a function of the\nwork done by the stresses. This has as a consequence the coupling of internal energy, pressure, and\ndeviatoric stresses resulting in a nonlinear problem.\nIn contemporary hydrocodes available EOS\u2019s are either of an analytical or a tabulated type. In\nthis paper the Mie-Gruneisen EOS7,8 implemented in LLNL--DYNA3D was used, this an analytic EOS\nfrequently used when modelling solid materials.

Experimental validation\nTwo plate impact tests on composite targets2-4, manufactured from woven carbon fibre-epoxy\nplies, have been used for model validation. One plate impact test was an impact normal to the fibre\ndirection where shock wave propagated through the thickness of the composite material. The other test\nwas an impact parallel to the one of the fibre directions, where shock waves propagated in the\nlongitudinal direction. In both cases, the carbon fibre composite target plate was modelled as a quasi-\northotropic material. The equivalent material properties of the woven composite plate were determined\nfrom the layer macro mechanical properties given in Table 1. for the lay up [0\/90, \u00b145]4. The longitudinal\nspeed of sound was 10 3020C ms -= for the initial material density 30 1500 \/kg mr = .\nTable 1.

The FE Model used to simulate plate impact through thickness of the composite plate\nFIGURE 3. The FE Model used to simulate plate impact in the longitudinal direction\nThe tests involved metal flyer plates impacting a target with a surface metal cover of the same\nmaterial as the flyer and a rear, thick polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) backing. The plate impact tests\nwere modelled using a uniaxial strain state under the assumption that the deformation process is adiabatic.\nSymmetry boundary conditions were applied to all free surfaces parallel to the impact direction and a\nnon-reflective boundary was applied to the back of PMMA-block. The material and velocities of the flyer\nplate, dimensions of the flyer and target plates as well as the mesh resolution differed between the two\ntarget\nflyer\ncover plate\nPMMA\nflyer\ncover plate\ntarget\nPMMA\n11\nsimulations and will be separately defined for each case. A surface to surface contact algorithm was used\nat the flyer target interface.\n5.1 Through Thickness Impact\nThe aluminium alloy flyer plate was assigned the initial velocity of 504 m\/s, as measured in the\nexperiment2,3. The flyer plate was 5 mm thick and it was modelled with 30 elements while the test\nspecimen was modelled with 142 elements along the impact axis. This mesh resolution was sufficient to\nmodel formation and propagation of the shockwaves. In the experiment the front gauge was covered with\na 1 mm aluminium alloy plate while the rear gauge was backed with 12 mm of PMMA. The thickness of\nthe composite plate specimen was 3.8mm.\nAluminium was modelled using an elastic-plastic hydrodynamic model (material 10) with\nmaterial properties: initial density 30 2703 \/kg mr = , shear modulus, 27.6G GPa\uf03d and yield strength\n290Y MPa\uf03d . The parameters for the Mie-Gr\u00fcneisen EOS had the following values: 5240 mc\ns\n\uf03d , 1 1.4S \uf03d ,\n2 0S \uf03d , 3 0S \uf03d , 0 1.97\uf067 \uf03d , 0.48a \uf03d . The data for PMMA was taken from the literature\n7. The carbon fibre\nepoxy target plate was modelled as a quasi-orthotropic material with the properties given in Table 1. The\nEOS data for the composite material used in the model was: 3230 \/c m s\uf03d , 1 0.92S \uf03d , 2 0S \uf03d , 3 0S \uf03d ,\n0 0.84\uf067 \uf03d , 0.50a \uf03d (must add an explanation of the source of these figures).\nStress along the axis of impact (the Z axis) obtained by decomposition 1 (\uf079 ) and decomposition 2\n(\uf07a ) as well as the results obtained using Anderson\u2019s model9 are shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5. Stress in the Z\ndirection at the front surface of the composite material is compared with the stress history from the front\ngauge whilst stress in PMMA is compared with the measurements from the rear gauge. The results\nobtained using decomposition 1 show a good agreement of the stress magnitude and the pulse length with\ncorresponding experimental measurements. Decomposition 2 significantly overestimates the stress in the\ncomposite material. Furthermore the simulation based on the decomposition 2 incorrectly predicts\nseparation of the flyer plate from the cover plate, while the decomposition 1 agrees with the experiment,\ni.e. the flyer plate stays in contact with the cover plate. In Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 it can be clearly seen that\nAnderson\u2019s model overestimates the longitudinal stress level as well as predicting separation of the flyer\nfrom the cover plate.\n12\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n3.5\n0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5\nTime [\u00b5s]\nZ\nst\nre\nss\n[G\nP\na]\nDecomposition 1_Composite front gauge\nDecomposition 2_Composite Anderson's model\nFIGURE 4.

Longitudinal Impact\nThe FE model used for simulations of the plate impacts in plane of fibre reinforcement is shown\n13\nin Fig. 3. This model corresponds to the experimental setup used by Millet3. For these simulations only\ndecomposition 1 was used, following the good agreement with the experimental data seen in the through\nthickness simulations.\nTwo further tests using different flyer plate materials were performed; one with a copper flyer\nplate and the other with a tungsten flyer plate. Furthermore, two different composite specimen\nthicknesses, 6 mm and 10 mm, were tested with the copper flyer plate. In all these experiments, 12 mm\nthick PMMA backing plates and 1 mm thick cover plates on the specimen were used.\nThe initial velocity of the copper flyer plate was 940 m\/s, for both specimen thicknesses, as\nreported for the experiments3. The flyer plate was 5mm thick and modelled with 10 elements along the\nimpact axes. The 10 mm composite was modelled with 48 elements while the 6mm specimen was\nmodelled with 40 elements along the impact axis. The tungsten flyer plate had an initial velocity of 927\nm\/s as reported for the experiments3. The flyer plate was 5mm thick and it was modelled with 10\nelements while the test specimen was modelled with 48 elements along the impact axis.

The EOS data for the composite material used in the model was: 3230 \/c m s\uf03d ,\n1 0.92S \uf03d , 2 0S \uf03d , 3 0S \uf03d , 0 0.84\uf067 \uf03d , 0.50a \uf03d .\nIn the case of the through thickness test and simulation, the shock front is planar and parallel to\nthe composite plies. Consequently the stress measured by the gauge and the stress in the corresponding\nfinite elements is directly comparable. In the case of longitudinal impact the shock front is not planar due\nto the different ply orientations. Consequently the gauge measures averaged stresses over a number of\nplies. Each composite ply was 0.475mm thick, while the gauges were 5mm long and at 45\u00ba relative to the\nplies. Therefore it was necessary to average the stress at the gauge locations in the simulations to allow\nfor comparison with the experimental data. Here only the results from the back of the specimens are\nshown because of uncertainty in the experimental results from the front gauge.\nThe stress along the axis of impact (Z axes) at the back of the specimen was obtained for the\nimpact of a copper flyer plate on 6 mm and 10 mm specimens, shown in Fig. 6. These results are\ncompared to the experimental rear surface gauge histories3. The results show good agreement in the\nstress magnitude and the pulse length with the corresponding experimental measurements. There are\nclear differences in the rising part of the curves, especially for the 10 mm specimen, which are not fully\nunderstood. They could be due to the measurement technique used in the experiments and some physical\nprocesses occurring in the composite that are not captured by the model. The end of the numerically\nobtained pulse differs from the experiment, likely due to the fact that material damage, observed in the\nexperiments is not considered in the simulations. An additional source of the discrepancy could be the\ndifference in averaging of the stress in the gauges and in the numerical simulations along with loss of\nuniaxial strain at late times.\nNumerical results and a rear surface gauge history for the impact of the tungsten alloy flyer plate\nare shown in Fig. 7. This result shows better agreement in the stress magnitude and in the pulse length\nwith the experimental curves compared to the results for the copper plate impact. There is still difference\nin the rising part of the slopes, but the magnitude of the pulse seems the same.\n15\n-0.5\n0.5\n1.5\n2.5\n3.5\n4.5\n5.5\n1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5\nTime [\u00b5s]\nZ\nst\nre\nss\n[G\nP\na]\nnumerical results 10mm\nnumerical results 6mm\nexperimental results 6mm\nexperimental results 10mm\nFIGURE 6.

Summary\nAs observed by Anderson1 the shock response of an orthotropic material can not be accurately\npredicted using the conventional decomposition of the stress tensor into isotropic and deviatoric parts.\nThis paper presents two different stress decompositions based on the assumption that the stress tensor is\n16\nsplit into two components; one component due to volumetric strain and the other due to deviatoric strain,\ninstead of volumetric stress and deviatoric stress. Both decompositions are rigorously derived. In order\nto test their ability to describe shock propagation in orthotropic materials, both algorithms were\nimplemented in a hydrocode and their predictions compared with experimental plate impact data. The\nmaterial considered was a carbon fibre reinforced epoxy material which was tested in both the through-\nthickness and longitudinal directions.\nThe two decompositions were validated against the through thickness experimental data. The \uf079\ndecomposition showed good agreement with the physical behaviour of the considered material while the\n\uf07a decomposition significantly overestimated the longitudinal stresses. The experimental curves were\nalso compared with predictions made using the decomposition proposed by Anderson, which significantly\noverestimated the longitudinal stress.\nThe \uf079 decomposition was then used to simulate three plate impact tests in the longitudinal\ndirection. The simulation results showed good agreement with the experimental data. Differences\nbetween the experimental traces and numerical results in these test cases could be a consequence of the\norientation and position of the gauges related to the lay up of the composite material as well as the gauge\naveraging the recorded stress across its area. Thus an important feature of further validation would be to\nsuch simulations should be to improve the understanding of the experimental averaging occurring in the\ngauge so that it can be replicated in the simulation.\nAcknowledgment\nThe authors would like to acknowledge that this work was part-funded by the UK Engineering and\nPhysical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) Grant Reference: GR\/S33956\/01\nThe authors would like to thank Professor Stephan Hiermaier, Ernst Mach Institute, Freiburg, for his\nconstructive comments and suggestions during this work.\n7.
