INTRODUCTION\nThe development of radioa\rtive nu\rlear beam fa\rili-\nties has allowed the study of nu\rlei far from the line\nof stability, bringing to the fore new nu\rlear stru\rture\nproblems. A signi\u001c\rant topi\r in re\rent years has been\nthe study of halo nu\rlei [1, 2, 3\u2104. These are weakly\nbound, spatially extended systems, typi\rally \romprising\na \rore and one or two valen\re nu\rleons. Parti\rularly in-\nteresting examples of su\rh systems are Borromean nu-\n\rlei, i.e., three-body \romposite systems with no binary\nbound states. These nu\rlei have attra\rted spe\rial atten-\ntion be\rause their loosely bound nature re\u001de\rts a deli\rate\ninterplay between two- and three-body for\res, \ronstitut-\ning a \rhallenge to existing theories, and a motivation for\nthe development of new ones. The detailed stru\rture of\nthe \rontinuum spe\rtrum of these systems is still not fully\nunderstood, partially due to the ambiguities asso\riated\nwith the underlying for\res between the \ronstituents. Due\nto their low binding energy, halo nu\rlei are easily broken\nup in the nu\rlear and Coulomb \u001celd of the target nu-\n\rleus. Therefore few-body rea\rtion theories, developed\nto extra\rt reliable information from experimental data\nof rea\rtions involving loosely bound systems, have to in-\n\rlude, as an essential ingredient, a realisti\r des\rription of\n\roupling to the \rontinuum part of the spe\rtrum.\nFrom the theoreti\ral point of view, the treatment of re-\na\rtions involving loosely bound systems must deal with\nthe \rompli\ration that these \rontinuum breakup states\nare not square-normalizable. A \ronvenient method to\n\rir\rumvent this problem is to repla\re the states in the\n\rontinuum by a \u001cnite set of normalized states, thus pro-\nviding a dis\rrete basis that, hopefully, \ran be trun\rated\nto a small number of states and yet provide a reliable\ndes\rription of the \rontinuum. Several pres\rriptions to\n\ronstru\rt su\rh a dis\rrete basis have been proposed. For\ntwo-body \romposite systems, where the \rontinuum states\nare easily \ral\rulated, one \ran use a dis\rretization pro\re-\ndure in whi\rh the \rontinuum spe\rtrum is trun\rated at a\nmaximum ex\ritation energy and divided into energy in-\ntervals. For ea\rh interval, or bin, a normalizable state is\n\ronstru\rted by superposition of s\rattering states within\nthat bin interval. The method, normally used in the\n\rontinuum-dis\rretized \roupled-\rhannels (CDCC) frame-\nwork [4, 5\u2104, has been very useful in the des\rription of elas-\nti\r and breakup observables in rea\rtions involving weakly\nbound two-body proje\rtiles.\nAn alternative to the binning pro\redure is to represent\nthe \rontinuum spe\rtrum by the eigenstates of the internal\nHamiltonian in a basis of square integrable (or L2) fun\r-\ntions, su\rh as Laguerre [6, 7, 8\u2104, Gaussian [9, 10\u2104 or Stur-\nmian [11, 12, 13, 14\u2104 fun\rtions. In pra\rti\re, the diagonal-\nization is performed in a \u001cnite (trun\rated) set of states\nand the resulting eigenstates, also known as pseudo-states\n(PS), are regarded as a \u001cnite and dis\rrete representation\nof the spe\rtrum of the system. The pseudo-states are\nthen used within a \roupled-\rhannels \ral\rulation in the\nsame way as the \rontinuum bins.\nThe PS method has the appealing feature of being\nreadily appli\rable also to des\rribe the spe\rtrum of three-\nbody systems, in whi\rh \rase the Hamiltonian is diagonal-\nized in a \romplete set of square-integrable fun\rtions for\nthe three-body Hilbert spa\re. Several appli\rations of this\nmethod \ran be found in the literature, for both stru\rture\n[15\u2104 and rea\rtion problems [16\u2104. In the latter \rase, the\nmethod is an extension of the CDCC formalism to re-\na\rtions with three-body proje\rtiles, using a pseudo-state\nmodel for the \rontinuum.\nOne su\rh PS method proposed re\rently is the Trans-\nformed Harmoni\r Os\rillator (THO) method [17, 18\u2104.\nGiven the ground-state wave fun\rtion of the system, the\nTHO method performs a Lo\ral S\rale Transformation\n2(LST) [19\u2104 that \ronverts the bound ground-state wave\nfun\rtion of the system into the ground-state wave fun\r-\ntion of a Harmoni\r Os\rillator (HO). On\re the LST is\nobtained, the HO basis \ran be transformed, by the in-\nverse LST, to a dis\rrete basis in the physi\ral spa\re. The\nTHO basis fun\rtions are not eigenfun\rtions of the Hamil-\ntonian (ex\rept for the ground state) but the Hamiltonian\n\ran be diagonalized in an appropriate trun\rated basis\nto produ\re approximate eigenvalues and eigenfun\rtions.\nThis method has been shown to be useful for des\rribing\nthe two-body \rontinuum in both stru\rture [17, 18, 20\u2104\nand s\rattering [21, 22, 23\u2104 problems. In a re\rent work\n[24\u2104 the THO method was generalized to des\rribe \rontin-\nuum states of three-body systems, based on expansion\nin Hyperspheri\ral Harmoni\rs (HH) [25\u2104. In parti\rular\nthe method was applied to the Borromean nu\rleus\n6\nHe,\nfor whi\rh several strength fun\rtions, in\rluding the dipole\nand quadrupole Coulomb transition strengths, were \ral-\n\rulated. These observables are found to \ronverge qui\rkly\nwith respe\rt to the number of THO basis states in\rluded.\nFurthermore, the \ral\rulated strength distributions are in\nvery good agreement with those obtained using three-\nbody s\rattering wave fun\rtions [26\u2104.\nMost of our knowledge of\n6\nHe \romes from the analy-\nsis of rea\rtions where se\rondary beams \rollide with sta-\nble nu\rlei. These experiments have been performed with\nboth light [27, 28\u2104 and heavy targets [29, 30, 31, 32, 33\u2104,\nand at low and high energies, providing a body of data\nwhi\rh \ran be used to ben\rhmark rea\rtion and stru\rture\nmodels. The theoreti\ral understanding of rea\rtions in-\nvolving a three-body proje\rtile, su\rh as\n6\nHe, is a \rompli-\n\rated task be\rause it requires the solution of a four-body\ns\rattering problem. At high energies, a variety of approx-\nimations have been used su\rh as semi\rlassi\ral approxima-\ntions [34, 35, 36\u2104, frozen halo or adiabati\r approximations\n[37, 38\u2104, Multiple S\rattering expansions [39, 40, 41\u2104, four-\nbody DWBA [42, 43\u2104, among others. However, at ener-\ngies of a few MeV per nu\rleon, some of these approxima-\ntions are not justi\u001ced. Then the use of the CDCCmethod\nis an alternative to solve these problems. For a four-body\nproblem (three-body proje\rtile) this method has already\nbeen applied using a PS basis based on Gaussian fun\r-\ntions. The s\rattering of\n6\nHe by\n12\nC [16\u2104 and\n209\nBi [44\u2104\nhave been studied. In both \rases a good agreement was\nobtained with the experimental data of Refs. [45, 46\u2104 and\n[31\u2104, respe\rtively.\nIn this work, we study the s\rattering of a three-body\nproje\rtile by a target using the CDCC formalism. The\nnovel feature of the present approa\rh is the use of the\nTHO PS basis to represent the states of the proje\rtile.\nThese states are then used to generate the proje\rtile-\ntarget \roupling potentials that enter the system of \rou-\npled equations. Furthermore, we have developed a new\npro\redure to \ral\rulate these \roupling potentials making\nuse of an expansion of the wave fun\rtions of the proje\rtile\ninternal states in a HH basis.\nThis paper is stru\rtured as follows. In Se\rtion II the\nthree-body dis\rretization method is presented. In Se\r-\ntion III the multipole expansion of the intera\rtion poten-\ntial between the proje\rtile and the target is addressed.\nIn Se\rtion IV we des\rribe the three-body model for the\nBorromean nu\rleus\n6\nHe. In Se\rtion V we apply the for-\nmalism to the rea\rtions\n6\nHe+12C at Elab=229.8 MeV,\n6\nHe+64Zn at Elab=13.6 and 10 MeV, and\n6\nHe+208Pb at\nElab=22 MeV. Finally, Se\rtion VI summarizes and draws\n\ron\rlusions.\nII. THREE-BODY CONTINUUM\nDISCRETIZATION METHOD\nThe THO dis\rretization method applied to a three-\nbody system is des\rribed in detail in Ref. [24\u2104. For \rom-\npleteness, in this Se\rtion we outline the main features of\nthe formalism. In the three-body \rase, it is \ronvenient\nto work with the hyperspheri\ral \roordinates {\u03c1, \u03b1, x\u0302, y\u0302}.\nThey are obtained from the Ja\robi \roordinates {x,y}\nthat are illustrated in Fig. 1. The variable x is propor-\ntional to the relative \roordinate between two of the parti-\n\rles, with a s\raling fa\rtor depending on their masses [20\u2104\nand y is proportional to the \roordinate from the \renter\nof mass of these two parti\rles to the third parti\rle, again\nwith a s\raling fa\rtor depending on their masses. From\nthese \roordinates, the hyperradius (\u03c1) and the hyperan-\ngle (\u03b1) are de\u001cned as \u03c1 =\n\u221a\nx2 + y2 and tan\u03b1 = x\/y.\nObviously there are three di\u001berent Ja\robi sets but \u03c1 is\nthe same for all of them.\nFor a three-body system the dis\rretization method has\ntwo parts. First, the wave fun\rtions of the system are\nexpanded in Hyperspheri\ral Harmoni\rs (HH) [25\u2104. We\nde\u001cne states of good total angular momentum as\nY\u03b2j\u00b5(\u2126) =\n\u2211\n\u03bd\u03b9\n\u3008jab\u03bdI\u03b9|j\u00b5\u3009\u03c7\n\u03b9\nI\n\u00d7\n\u2211\nml\u03c3\n\u3008lmlSx\u03c3|jab\u03bd\u3009\u03a5\nlxly\nKlml\n(\u2126)\u03c7\u03c3Sx , (1)\nwhere \u03a5\nlxly\nKlm(\u2126) are the hyperspheri\ral harmoni\rs that\ndepend on the angular variables \u2126 \u2261 {\u03b1, x\u0302, y\u0302}, \u03c7\u03c3Sx is\nthe spin wave fun\rtion of the two parti\rles related by\nthe \roordinate x, and \u03c7\u03b9I is the spin fun\rtion of the\nthird parti\rle. Ea\rh \romponent of the wavefun\rtion\n(or \rhannel) is de\u001cned by the set of quantum numbers\n\u03b2 \u2261 {K, lx, ly, l, Sx, jab}. Here, K is the hypermomen-\ntum, lx and ly are the orbital angular momenta asso\ri-\nated with the Ja\robi \roordinates x and y, l = lx + ly is\nthe total orbital angular momentum, Sx is the spin of the\nparti\rles related by the \roordinate x, and jab = l + Sx.\nFinally, j = jab+I is the total angular momentum, with\nI the spin of the third parti\rle, whi\rh we assume \u001cxed.\nThe physi\ral states of the system \ran now be expressed\nas a linear \rombination of the states given by Eq. (1) as\n\u03c8j\u00b5(\u03c1,\u2126) =\n\u2211\n\u03b2\nR\u03b2j(\u03c1)Y\u03b2j\u00b5(\u2126), (2)\nwhere {R\u03b2j} are the hyperradial wave fun\rtions.\n3Se\rondly, the THO method is used to obtain the fun\r-\ntions R\u03b2j(\u03c1). Writing the ground-state wave fun\rtion in\nthe form of Eq. (2), the equation that de\u001cnes the LST\nfor ea\rh \rhannel \u03b2 is\n|NB\u03b2|\n2\n\u222b \u03c1\n0\nd\u03c1\u2032\u03c1\u20325|RB\u03b2(\u03c1\n\u2032)|2 =\n\u222b s\n0\nds\u2032s\u20325|RHO0K (s\n\u2032)|2, (3)\nwhere RB\u03b2(\u03c1) is the bound ground-state hyperradial\nwave fun\rtion for the \rhannel \u03b2, with NB\u03b2 the normal-\nization fa\rtor, and RHO0K (s) is the ground-state hyperra-\ndial wave fun\rtion of the HO for the hypermomentum\nK, that is already normalized. Finally, the THO basis is\n\ronstru\rted for ea\rh \rhannel by applying the LST, s\u03b2(\u03c1),\nto the HO basis\nRTHOi\u03b2 (\u03c1) =\nNiK\nN0K\nNB\u03b2RB\u03b2(\u03c1)L\nK+2\ni (s\u03b2(\u03c1)\n2), (4)\n\u03c8THOi\u03b2j\u00b5 (\u03c1,\u2126) = R\nTHO\ni\u03b2 (\u03c1)Y\u03b2j\u00b5(\u2126) (5)\nwhere the L\u03bbi (t) are generalized Laguerre polynomials\nand NiK is the normalization \ronstant of the HO basis.\nHere the index i denotes the number of hyperradial ex\ri-\ntations. Note that as i in\rreases, the fun\rtions RTHOi\u03b2 (\u03c1)\nbe\rome more os\rillatory and explore larger distan\res.\nFor \rhannels with quantum numbers that do not \ron-\ntribute to the ground-state wave fun\rtion, the (ground\nstate) \rhannel with the \rlosest quantum labels to the\n\rhannel of interest is used to \ronstru\rt the LST. One im-\nportant point \ron\rerns the label K whi\rh governs the \u03c1K\nbehavior of the hyperradial wave fun\rtion \rlose to the\norigin. To guarantee the \rorre\rt behavior of the wave-\nfun\rtion, we sele\rt a \rhannel from the ground-state wave\nfun\rtion with the same K. If this is not possible, a \rhan-\nnel with K\u22121 is used and the \rorresponding hyperradial\nwave fun\rtion is then multiplied by \u03c1.\nThe required dis\rrete eigenstates are now \ral\rulated by\ndiagonalizing the three-body Hamiltonian of the proje\r-\ntile in a \u001cnite THO basis up to nb hyperradial ex\ritations\nin ea\rh \rhannel,\n\u03c6THOnj\u00b5 (x,y) =\n\u2211\n\u03b2\nnb\u2211\ni=0\nCi\u03b2jn \u03c8\nTHO\ni\u03b2j\u00b5 (\u03c1,\u2126), (6)\nwhere n labels the eigenstates for a given angular momen-\ntum j and \u03b5nj will be the asso\riated energy. Repla\ring in\nthis expression the fun\rtions \u03c8THOi\u03b2j\u00b5 (\u03c1,\u2126) by their expli\rit\nexpansion in terms of the HH, Eq. (5), and performing\nthe sum in the index i for i = 0, . . . , nb, we \ran express\nthe PS basis states as\n\u03c6THOnj\u00b5 (x,y) =\n\u2211\n\u03b2\nRTHOn\u03b2j (\u03c1)Y\u03b2j\u00b5(\u2126). (7)\nNote that the \rhoi\re of the HO parameter has no in-\n\u001duen\re in the \ral\rulation of the LST sin\re \rhanges to\nthis parameter are equivalent to making a linear trans-\nformation in the os\rillator variable s. This gives the same\nresult for the right part of Eq. (3).\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001x\nr\ny\nr\nr\nR2\n1\n3 target\nprojectile\nFigure 1: (Color online) Relevant \roordinates for the s\ratter-\ning of a three-body proje\rtile by a stru\rtureless target.\nIII. MULTIPOLE EXPANSION OF THE\nPROJECTILE-TARGET POTENTIAL\nThe eigenstates given in Eq. (7) are a dis\rrete repre-\nsentation of the states of the three-body proje\rtile.

The \roupling potentials V JLnj,L\u2032n\u2032j\u2032(R) are then\nV JLnj,L\u2032n\u2032j\u2032 (R) = \u3008LnjJM |V\u0302pt(r1, r2, r3)|L\n\u2032n\u2032j\u2032JM\u3009,\n(10)\nwhere the ket |LnjJM\u3009 denotes the fun\rtion\n\u03a6JMLnj(R\u0302,x,y) given by\n\u03a6JMLnj(R\u0302,x,y) =\n\u2211\n\u00b5ML\n\u03c6THOnj\u00b5 (x,y)\u3008LMLj\u00b5|JM\u3009YLML(R\u0302).\n(11)\nTo \ral\rulate these \roupling potentials, a multipole ex-\npansion of the proje\rtile-target intera\rtion is developed.\nThe pro\redure is analogous to that for a three-body\nproblem reported in Ref. [47\u2104. In that work the tradi-\ntional method of bin averaging was used as dis\rretization\nmethod instead of the THO method. We assume that the\nproje\rtile-target intera\rtion is the sum of the intera\rtions\nof ea\rh parti\rle of the proje\rtile with the target, Vkt(rk)\nwith k = 1, 2, 3. For ea\rh pair potential, an appropriate\n4Ja\robi set is \rhosen so that the \rorresponding \roordinate\nrk depends only on the ve\rtors R and yk. Assuming that\nthe potentials are \rentral, the \roe\u001e\rients of the multipole\nexpansion are generated as\nVkQ(R, yk) =\n1\n2\n\u222b +1\n\u22121\nV k(rk)PQ(zk)dzk, (12)\nwhere PQ(zk) is a Legendre polynomial, Q is the mul-\ntipole order and zk = y\u0302k \u00b7 R\u0302 is the \rosine of the angle\nbetween yk and R. So, the \roupling potential \ran be\nexpressed as\nV JLnj,L\u2032n\u2032j\u2032(R) =\n\u2211\nQ\n(\u22121)J\u2212jL\u02c6L\u02c6\u2032\n(\nL Q L\u2032\n0 0 0\n)\nW (LL\u2032jj\u2032, QJ)FQnj,n\u2032j\u2032(R), (13)\nwhere the radial form fa\rtor FQnj,n\u2032j\u2032 (R) is\nFQnj,n\u2032j\u2032(R) = (\u22121)\nQ+2j\u2212j\u2032 j\u02c6j\u02c6\u2032(2Q+ 1)\n\u2211\n\u03b2\u03b2\u2032\n3\u2211\nk=1\n\u2211\n\u03b2k\u03b2\n\u2032\nk\nN\u03b2\u03b2kN\u03b2\u2032\u03b2\u2032k\n\u00d7 (\u22121)lxk+Sxk+j\n\u2032\nabk\u2212jabk\u2212Ik\u03b4lxkl\u2032xk\u03b4SxkS\n\u2032\nxk\nl\u02c6yk l\u02c6\n\u2032\nyk l\u02c6k l\u02c6\n\u2032\nk j\u02c6abk j\u02c6\n\u2032\nabk\n(\nlyk Q l\n\u2032\nyk\n0 0 0\n)\n\u00d7 W (lkl\n\u2032\nklykl\n\u2032\nyk;Qlxk)W (jabkj\n\u2032\nabklkl\n\u2032\nk;QSxk)W (jj\n\u2032jabkj\n\u2032\nabk;QIk)\n\u00d7\n\u222b \u222b\n(sin\u03b1k)\n2(cos\u03b1k)\n2d\u03b1k \u03c1\n5d\u03c1 RTHOn\u03b2j (\u03c1)\u03d5\nlxklyk\nKk\n(\u03b1k)V\nk\nQ(R, yk)\u03d5\nlxkl\n\u2032\nyk\nK\u2032\nk\n(\u03b1k)R\nTHO\nn\u2032\u03b2\u2032j\u2032 (\u03c1), (14)\nwith \u03b2k being the set of quantum numbers in the k'th\nJa\robi system where the potential depends on xk, and\n\u03b2 being the set in the Ja\robi system in whi\rh the states\nof the proje\rtile are \ral\rulated. The matrix elements\nN\u03b2\u03b2k transform the hyperangular, angular and spin part\nof the wave fun\rtions from one Ja\robi set to another.\nTheir expli\rit expression as a fun\rtion of the Raynal-\nRevai \roe\u001e\rients is developed in Ref. [48\u2104. Note that\nEqs. (13) and (14) are \rompletely general, and do not\ndepend on the nature of the basis.\nIV. STRUCTURE MODEL FOR\n6\nHE\nThe\n6\nHe nu\rleus is treated here as a three-body sys-\ntem, \romprising an inert \u03b1 \rore and two valen\re neu-\ntrons. The ground state has total angular momentum\njpi = 0+ with experimental binding energy of 0.973 MeV.\nThe ground state wave fun\rtion was obtained by solv-\ning the S\rhr\u00f6dinger equation in hyperspheri\ral \roordi-\nnates, following the pro\redure des\rribed in [25, 48\u2104, and\nmaking use of the \rodes fa\re [48\u2104+ sturmxx [49\u2104. In\nthese \ral\rulations, the n-4He potential was taken from\nRef. [50\u2104. It \ronsists of an energy independent Woods-\nSaxon potential, supplemented by a spin-orbit term with\na Woods-Saxon derivative radial shape. This potential\nreprodu\res the low-energy s- and p-phase shifts up to 10\nMeV. For the NN intera\rtion we used the potential pro-\nposed by Gogny, Pires and Tourreil (GPT) [51\u2104, whi\rh\n\rontains \rentral, spin-orbit and tensor \romponents. This\nintera\rtion was developed to give simultaneously an a\r-\n\reptable \u001ct to two nu\rleon s\rattering data up to 300 MeV\nand to des\rribe reasonably the properties for \u001cnite nu-\n\rlei, parti\rularly the radii, within the Hartree-Fo\rk ap-\nproximation. Besides the two-body (n \u2212 n and n \u2212 \u03b1)\npotentials, the model Hamiltonian also in\rludes a simple\nphenomenologi\ral three-body for\re, depending only on\nthe hyperradius, a\r\rording to the following power form\nv3b(\u03c1) = \u2212\na\n1 + (\u03c1\/b)c\n, (15)\nwhere a, b, and c are adjustable parameters. This po-\ntential is introdu\red to \rorre\rt the under-binding \raused\nby our negle\rt of other \ron\u001cgurations, su\rh as the t+t\n\rhannel.\nWe have performed di\u001berent \ral\rulations that trun\rate\nthe maximum hypermomentum at Kmax = 2, 4, 6, 8, and\n10, respe\rtively. For ea\rh value of Kmax, the three-body\npotential has been adjusted to give the same binding en-\nergy and mean square radius (for jpi = 0+ states) and the\nsame position for the 2+ resonan\re (for jpi = 2+ states).\nThe latter value was also used for the jpi = 1\u2212 states.\n50\n10\n20\n30\n\u03b5(M\neV\n)\n0+ 1- 2+\nFigure 2: Energy spe\rtrum of the states with jpi = 0+, jpi =\n1\n\u2212\n, and jpi = 2+ up to 30 MeV ex\ritation, obtained for a\nTHO basis with Kmax = 8 and nb = 4.\nThe parameter a varies with Kmax and j, being of the\norder of 4 MeV for jpi = 0+ and 3 MeV for jpi = 1\u2212, 2+.\nThe parameter b varies with Kmax, within the range 4-6\nfm. The parameter c was \u001cxed to 3 in all \rases.\nThe number of \rhannels \u03b2 for ea\rh \ral\rulation in-\n\rreases drasti\rally with Kmax, making the \ral\rulations\nmu\rh more demanding \romputationally. In the follow-\ning, unless stated otherwise, the \ral\rulations presented\nuse the basis with Kmax = 8. As we will show below,\nthis basis provides \ronverged results with respe\rt to the\nhypermomentum for all the rea\rtions \ronsidered in this\nwork. For this \rase, the number of \rhannels \u03b2 is 15 for\njpi = 0+, 26 for jpi = 1\u2212 and 46 for jpi = 2+. The \ral-\n\rulated three-body wave fun\rtion has a binding energy\nof 0.95372 MeV and a rms point nu\rleon matter radius\nof 2.46 fm when assuming an alpha-parti\rle rms matter\nradius of 1.47 fm.\nThe Ja\robi set in whi\rh the two neutrons are related\nby the \roordinate x is \rhosen to generate the THO ba-\nsis. Applying the THO method and diagonalizing the\nHamiltonian in a \u001cnite THO basis, a set of eigenstates\nis obtained. For j = 0+, the diagonalization produ\res\na state with negative energy, that \rorresponds to the\nground state of the system. The remaining eigenvalues\nappear at positive energy, and are then asso\riated with\na dis\rrete representation of the \rontinuum spe\rtrum. As\nan example, in Fig. 2 we present the distribution of eigen-\nvalues obtained for a basis with nb = 4, for the states\nj = 0+, j = 1\u2212, and j = 2+ up to 30 MeV.\nV. APPLICATION TO REACTIONS\nIn this Se\rtion we apply the formalism developed in\nSe\r. III to di\u001berent rea\rtions indu\red by\n6\nHe, taking\nthe eigenstates obtained with the THO basis to repre-\nsent the proje\rtile states. We note that, even for a small\nvalue of nb, the THO method will produ\re eigenstates\nat very high ex\ritation energies. States above a \rertain\nex\ritation energy will not be relevant for the des\rription\nof the \rollision pro\ress, sin\re they will be very weakly\n\roupled. For this reason, in these \ral\rulations the basis\nis trun\rated at a maximum ex\ritation energy, and only\nthose eigenstates below this value were in\rluded in the\n\roupled-\rhannels \ral\rulation. The maximum energy is\n\rhosen independently for ea\rh rea\rtion and ea\rh nb, in\norder to a\rhieve \ronvergen\re of the results with respe\rt\nto this energy.\nIn the present \ral\rulations, only the\n6\nHe states with\nj = 0+, 1\u2212, 2+ are \ronsidered. Previous CDCC \ral\rula-\ntions for the rea\rtions studied in this work [16, 44, 52\u2104\nhave shown that using these partial waves is su\u001e\rient\nto obtain \ronverged results and to des\rribe satisfa\rtorily\nthe existing data for su\rh rea\rtions. We did not attempt\nto in\rlude higher partial waves, sin\re this would make\nthe \ral\rulations very demanding \romputationally .\nFor these in\rluded jpi states the \roupling potentials\ngiven by Eq. (13) are \ral\rulated for multipolarities Q =\n0, 1, 2. Both Coulomb and nu\rlear intera\rtions were in-\n\rluded. We emphasize that \rontinuum-\rontinuum \rou-\nplings were also in\rluded. The diagonal as well as non-\ndiagonal \roupling potentials were generated by folding\nthe neutron-target and \u03b1-target intera\rtions a\r\rording\nto Eq. (10). These intera\rtions are represented by phe-\nnomenologi\ral opti\ral potentials at the relevant proje\r-\ntile in\rident energy per nu\rleon [53\u2104. Then, the \roupled\nequations (9) are solved with the \rode fres\ro [54\u2104, that\nreads the \roupling potentials from external \u001cles. In most\n\rases, the Numerov method was used to solve the \roupled\nequations. However, in some \rases, parti\rularly when\nex\ritation energies \rlose to the total kineti\r energy are\ninvolved, this method was found to be numeri\rally un-\nstable, and the R-matrix method [55\u2104 was used instead.\nThis method is more time \ronsuming but has the advan-\ntage of being numeri\rally more stable. In the following,\nwe present the results for di\u001berent rea\rtions for whi\rh\nexperimental data exist.\n6\nHe+12C. We study this rea\rtion at 229.8 MeV, for\n\romparison with the experimental data of Lapoux et\nal. [45\u2104. The n+12C potential was taken from the global\nparametrization of Watson et al. [56\u2104. The \u03b1+12C poten-\ntial was represented in terms of a standard Woods-Saxon\nshape with the parameters adjusted in order to reprodu\re\nthe elasti\r data for this system at 34.75 MeV per nu\rleon\n[57\u2104. The parameters for these potentials are listed in\nTable I.\nThe \roupled equations were solved up to J = 70 and\nthe solutions were mat\rhed to their asymptoti\r form at\nthe radius Rm = 200 fm. In Fig. 3 we present the an-\ngular distribution of the elasti\r di\u001berential \rross se\rtion\nrelative to Rutherford. The thi\rk solid line is the full\nCDCC result for a basis with nb=4. This \ral\rulation re-\nprodu\res the data fairly well (open \rir\rles) up to 10\n\u25e6\n,\nbut it \rlearly underestimates the data points at larger\nangles. Interestingly, this e\u001be\rt was also found in the\nphenomenologi\ral analysis of Lapoux et al. [45\u2104, as well\n6Table I: Opti\ral model parameters used in this work.

We also show the analo-\ngous \ral\rulation when omitting all the \rouplings to the\n\rontinuum (one \rhannel \ral\rulation) with a dashed line.\nFor the rea\rtion at 229.8MeV we \ron\rlude that the e\u001be\rt\nof \roupling to the \rontinuum is a redu\rtion of the \rross\nse\rtion for angles beyond 5\n\u25e6\n. This e\u001be\rt has also been\nobserved in the s\rattering of\n11\nBe+\n12\nC at E \u2243 49 MeV\nper nu\rleon [37\u2104, and is probably present in other rea\r-\ntions indu\red by weakly bound proje\rtiles at energies of\na few tens of MeV per nu\rleon. That the no-\rontinuum\n\roupling \ral\rulation reprodu\res the data reasonably well\nat the larger angles is probably fortuitous, and \rannot be\nattributed to the adequa\ry of this approximation. As we\nhave shown, \rontinuum \rouplings are very important in\nthis rea\rtion.\nWe also show in Fig. 3 the full CDCC \ral\rulation for\nnb=2 (dotted line). This \ral\rulation is pra\rti\rally undis-\ntinguishable from the \ral\rulation with nb=4, indi\rating\nthat it is not ne\ressary in this \rase to have a very pre-\n\rise dis\rretization of the \rontinuum in terms of ex\ritation\nenergy. We found that a maximum ex\ritation energy of\n\u03b5max =30 MeV provided good \ronvergen\re for all the val-\nues of nb presented.\n6\nHe+64Zn. We have studied this rea\rtion at two dif-\nferent energies, namely, 13.6 MeV and 10 MeV, for whi\rh\nexperimental data exist [58\u2104. The n+64Zn potential was\ntaken from the global parametrization of Koning and De-\nlaro\rhe [59\u2104. For the \u03b1+64Zn system, we took the opti-\n\ral potential derived in Ref. [58\u2104. The parameters are\nlisted in Table I. The \roupled equations were solved up\nto J = 60 and 40, respe\rtively, and for proje\rtile-target\nseparations up to Rm = 100 fm.\nIn Figs. 4 and 5 we present the experimental and \ral\ru-\nlated angular distributions of the elasti\r \rross se\rtion for\nthese two rea\rtions.

In the same \u001cgure, we also show the full\nCDCC \ral\rulation for a basis with nb=2 (dotted) and\n6 (dot-dashed). These two \ral\rulations are very \rlose\nto nb=4 showing a very good \ronvergen\re with respe\rt\nnb. The maximum ex\ritation energy required for \ron-\nvergen\re depended somewhat on the value of nb, ranging\nfrom \u03b5max=7 MeV (for nb=2) to \u03b5max=6 MeV (for nb=6)\nAt Elab=10 MeV (Fig. 5), the full CDCC \ral\rulation\nalso improves the agreement with the data at ba\rkward\nangles, although some underestimation remains. Inter-\nestingly, the data suggests the presen\re of a rainbow at\naround 50\n\u25e6\n, whi\rh is not present in our \ral\rulation. It\nshould be noted that the experimental error bars are large\nat this energy, so more a\r\rurate measurements would be\nneeded to make more de\u001cnite \ron\rlusions about this ap-\nparent dis\rrepan\ry.

In this \rase, we \u001cnd that the \ronver-\ngen\re with respe\rt nb is slower. However the \ral\rulations\nwith nb=4 and 6 are quite \rlose and give a reasonable\n\ronvergen\re.

For a meaningful \romparison,\nin all these \rases the three-body potential was adjusted\nin order to give the same binding energy and rms radius,\nfor j = 0+ and the same position for the resonan\re, for\nj = 2+. We found a relatively fast \ronvergen\re with re-\nspe\rt to this parameter. In parti\rular, the \ral\rulations\nwith Kmax = 6,8 and 10 are very similar (for \rlarity,\nthe latter has been omitted from the \u001cgure).

For \rlarity, we show only the re-\nsults for even values of nb. Unlike the previous \rases,\nthe \ronvergen\re rate found in this \rase was rather slow.\nAlthough the di\u001beren\res in the \ral\rulated \rross se\rtions\nare less than 5%, the os\rillatory pattern at the rainbow\nregion \rhanges from one value of nb to another. A pos-\nsible explanation for this slow \ronvergen\re rate is given\nbelow.\nIn Fig. 8 we \rompare the experimental and \ral\rulated\nangular distributions of the elasti\r \rross se\rtion. The\ndashed line is the one \rhannel \ral\rulation and the thi\rk\nsolid line the full CDCC \ral\rulation in\rluding the \rontin-\nuum. The latter uses Kmax = 8, \u03b5max = 8 MeV, nb = 4.\nThe one \rhannel \ral\rulation shows a rainbow that disap-\npears in the full \ral\rulation, in agreement with the data.\n80 30 60 90 120 150 180\n\u03b8\nc.m.\n (deg)\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n\u03c3\n\/\u03c3\nR\nut\nh\nnb=2 \u03b5max=10 MeV\nnb=4 \u03b5max=8 MeV\nnb=6 \u03b5max=8 MeV\nFigure 7: Convergen\re of the di\u001berential elasti\r \rross se\rtion\nwith respe\rt to nb, for the rea\rtion\n6\nHe+\n208\nPb at Elab=22\nMeV.\nAt ba\rkward angles, the agreement with the data is im-\nproved when we in\rlude the \roupling to the \rontinuum.\nIn order to show the \rontribution of the \rouplings to ea\rh\nj, we also in\rlude in this \u001cgure the \ral\rulation in\rluding\nonly j = 0+ states (dotted line) and the \ral\rulation with\nj = 0+, 1\u2212 states (thin solid line). From these \ral\rula-\ntions we \ran \ron\rlude that dipole \rouplings are the main\nresponsible for the \rhara\rteristi\r redu\rtion of the \rross\nse\rtion at the angles around the rainbow. The strong\nin\u001duen\re of dipole \rouplings might explain the slow \ron-\nvergen\re with respe\rt to the parameter nb found for this\nrea\rtion. These \rouplings are very sensitive to the ex\ri-\ntation energy of dipole states, whi\rh appear at di\u001berent\npositions in our dis\rrete representation of the\n6\nHe \rontin-\nuum, as we vary the number of hyperradial ex\ritations,\nnb. By \rontrast, in the\n6\nHe+\n12\nC \rase, dipole ex\ritations\nare very small, and this might explain the fast \ronver-\ngen\re with respe\rt to nb in that \rase.\nMoreover, we \u001cnd that the range of the form fa\rtors\n[Eq. (14)\u2104 \rhanges signi\u001c\rantly for the di\u001berent pseudo-\nstates as nb is \rhanged. This \rould also \rontribute to\nthe slow \ronvergen\re at s\rattering energies \rlose to the\nCoulomb barrier.\nVI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\nThe \rollision of a loosely bound three-body proje\rtile\nwith a target nu\rleus has been studied in the framework\nof the \rontinuum-dis\rretized \roupled-\rhannels (CDCC)\nmethod. A set of normalizable states, also known as\npseudo-states, is used to represent the three-body \rontin-\nuum of the proje\rtile. In parti\rular we took the Trans-\n0 30 60 90 120 150 180\n\u03b8\nc.m.\n (deg)\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n\u03c3\n\/\u03c3\nR\nut\nh\nexperimental data\none channel \nj=0+\nj=0+,1-\nj=0+,1-,2+\nFigure 8: (Color online) Elasti\r di\u001berential \rross se\rtion rela-\ntive to Rutherford as a fun\rtion of the s\rattering angle in the\nproje\rtile-target \renter of mass for the rea\rtion\n6\nHe+\n208\nPb\nat Elab=22 MeV. The full CDCC \ral\rulations uses nb =4 and\n\u03b5max = 8 MeV. Experimental data are from Ref. [60\u2104.\nformed Harmoni\r Os\rillator (THO) basis, whi\rh is \ron-\nstru\rted from the ground state of the system. Within\nthe spirit of the CDCC approa\rh, a multipole expansion\nof the \roupling potentials has been developed for a four-\nbody system (three-body proje\rtile plus a target).\nThe formalism has been applied to the rea\rtions\n6\nHe+12C at 229.8 MeV, 6He+64Zn at 13.6 and 10 MeV,\nand\n6\nHe+208Pb at 22 MeV, taking into a\r\rount both the\nCoulomb and nu\rlear intera\rtions.\nOverall, we \u001cnd good agreement between the \ral\ru-\nlated and the experimental elasti\r s\rattering angular dis-\ntributions. However, for the\n6\nHe+12C rea\rtion at 229.8\nMeV the \ral\rulations underestimate the experimental\ndata for \r.m. s\rattering angles beyond 10\n\u25e6\n. The fa\rt\nthat this e\u001be\rt was also found in previous analyses of\nthis rea\rtion [16, 45\u2104 suggests that the dis\rrepan\ry is not\nrelated to the parti\rular features of our approa\rh.\nFor the rea\rtion\n6\nHe+64Zn at 13.6 and 10 MeV the\n\ral\rulations are in fair agreement with the data, the re-\nprodu\rtion being better in the higher energy \rase. At 10\nMeV our \ral\rulations do not predi\rt a rainbow at around\n50\u25e6, a hint of whi\rh is seen in the data, but is broadly\n\ronsistent with the data within the stated experimental\nerrors.\nIn a\rtual \roupled-\rhannels \ral\rulations, the dis\rrete\nbasis has to be trun\rated in the ex\ritation energy (\u03b5max),\nthe maximum hypermomentum (Kmax), and the maxi-\nmum number of hyperradial ex\ritations (nb). In all the\n\rases under study, we have found a good \ronvergen\re of\nthe \ral\rulated observables with respe\rt to the parame-\nters \u03b5max and Kmax. However, the rate of \ronvergen\re\n9with respe\rt to nb was found to depend very mu\rh on\nthe spe\ri\u001c\r rea\rtion. For the rea\rtion\n6\nHe+12C at 229.8\nMeV the \ronvergen\re was found to be very fast, with\nnb = 2 providing fully \ronverged results. For\n6\nHe+64Zn\nat near-barrier energies, we required nb \u2248 4 for an a\r-\n\reptable \ronvergen\re. Finally, for\n6\nHe+208Pb at 22 MeV,\nthe \ronvergen\re was found to be slow and os\rillatory. In\nfa\rt, our biggest \ral\rulation, \rorresponding to nb = 6,\nis still not fully \ronverged. Be\rause of \romputational\nlimitations we have not explored this question further,\nas required to study the \ronvergen\re of the \ral\rulations\nwith respe\rt to the basis size.\nThis work shows that the use of the transformed har-\nmoni\r os\rillator basis, developed in previous works, \rom-\nbined with the standard CDCC method, provides a re-\nliable pro\redure for the treatment of the s\rattering of a\nloosely bound three-body proje\rtile by a target. It will\nbe interesting to \rompare this method with other repre-\nsentations of the \rontinuum, in\rluding the standard dis-\n\rretization pro\redure in terms of \rontinuum bins whi\rh,\nin the \rase of three-body proje\rtiles, requires the \ral\ru-\nlation of the three-body s\rattering states. This work is\nunderway and the results will be published elsewhere.\nA\rknowledgments\nThis work was supported in part by the DGICYT\nunder proje\rts FIS2005-01105 and FPA 2006-13807-\nC02-01, and in part by the FCT under the grants\nPOCTI\/ISFL\/2\/275 and POCTI\/FIS\/43421\/2001.
