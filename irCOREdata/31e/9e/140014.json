Introduction\nSol-gel deposition is a popular method of producing ferroelectric films such as\nlead zirconate titanate, PZT. It offers low-capital costs, large-scale coating capability\nand the potential for good control of chemical composition and homogeneity.\nGurkovich and Blum [1] were the first to demonstrate a metal alkoxide approach for\npreparing bulk gels in this system; the procedures formed the basis for later sol-gel\nthin film deposition work [2,3]. The majority of thin-film publications on sol-gel PZT\nyield ~0.1 \u00b5m ceramic layers after pyrolysis and crystallisation at temperatures up to\n~600 \u02daC. This thickness is suitable for applications such as FRAM\u2019s where\npolarisation switching can be achieved at a few volts. However thicker films, up to a\n** Corresponding author.

Unfortunately, coatings from the early sol-\ngel routes crack when thickness exceeds ~0.1-0.2 \u00b5m. The film structure cannot\nwithstand the stresses arising from the gel to ceramic conversion, and any thermal\nexpansion mismatch between the film and substrate. Multiple deposition of ~0.1 \u00b5m\nlayers with repetitive heat-treatments can be used to build up layer thickness [4] but it\nis a lengthy process and increases the total thermal input which can be detrimental to\nthe electrical and mechanical properties of the film and\/or component.\n Sayer et al. demonstrated that a hybrid particle\u2013gel approach can be applied to\nproduce PZT films a few tens of microns in thickness [5]. Particles are mixed with the\nsol before spin coating onto a substrate in a technique which has similarities to other\nslurry-based thick-film methods such as screen-printing or tape-casting. Porosity is a\nfeature of this approach but it has been shown that sol infiltration together with\nsintering aids can minimise porosity in PZT films ranging from a few micrometers to\n50 \u00b5m in thickness on platinised silicon substrates [6]; however some porosity\nremains.\n The possibility of increasing the thickness of the standard sol-gel process\nwithout adding a particulate component has also been investigated. It has been shown\nthat by moving from the hydrolysis-condensation gelation mechanism involving Ti\nand Zr isopropoxides, which underpinned the early PZT sol-gel routes, to gelation by\nmolecular bridging using a bi-functional alcohol, 1,3 propanediol, it was possible to\nproduce films with a single-layer, crack-free thickness of  ~ 1 \u00b5m [7,8]. Later a triol\nroute was developed which could also produce ~1 \u00b5m single-layers [9, 10]. The diol\nroute has been demonstrated for  multi-layer films up to 10 \u00b5m, and the triol route for\nfilms up to 3 \u00b5m [11,12], both requiring many fewer repetitions than for sols based on\nhydrolysis of metal alkoxides. Although surface and fracture sections appeared to be\ndense by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), subsequently transmission electron\nmicroscopy revealed that the films possessed nanoscale porosity, with most pores\nfalling in the range 20-30 nm [10,13].\nThe addition of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) to standard sols has also been\nshown to allow the crack-free thickness of PZT to be increased. Layers in the range\n0.5\u20132 \u00b5m have been reported [14, 15]. The thicker films contain a high pore fraction,\nwith pore sizes of ~ 100 nm clearly visible in SEM micrographs. Burnout of the high\nmolecular weight PVP is the probable cause of the relatively large pores. Single-layer,\ncrack-free films , 0.7 \u00b5m in thickness, have been  produced by adding ethylene glycol\nand ethanolamine to standard sols for the purpose of suppressing crack formation\n[16]; porosity levels were similar to those of films made with the PVP additive.\nThe thermal instability of the silicon substrates, which are used because of\ntheir technological relevance, precludes the use of high-temperature sintering which\notherwise could be used to densify the porous films. Excessive porosity is detrimental\nin terms of its effect in dissipating piezoelectric strains. However some porosity in the\nfilms may be beneficial in terms of providing a toughening mechanism making the\ncoatings more resistant to crack formation during heat-treatments.\nThis paper demonstrates a novel means of reducing porosity in thick sol-gel\nfilms by inserting a pressing step between the pyrolysis and crystallisation heat-\ntreatments. The film selected for this proof-of-principle demonstration is a 0.7 \u00b5m\nsingle-layer film in which pore sizes are ~ 100 nm, Fig 1.\n2. Experimental\nThe Pb(Zr0.3Ti 0.7) precursor sols were prepared by dissolving Pb(OAc)2.3H2O\nin methanol with gentle warming and stirring for 2h. The Zr(OnPr)4.nPrOH and\nTi(OnBu)4 reagents were mixed together, and an equal volume of acetic acid, and\nmethanol was added to the Zr\/Ti solution. The solution was stirred at room\ntemperature for 1h.  The Pb solution was added to the Zr\/Ti solution and the mixture\nwas further heated under reflux for 2h. After the solution was cooled to room\ntemperature, ethylene glycol (EG) was added in the ratio of 1 ml of EG per 1 g of sol.\nThe concentration of the stock solution was 0.6M. The solution used for coating films\nwas prepared by adding 2 ml of ethanolamine and 2 ml of distilled water to 30 ml of\nthe stock solution. Further details of the synthesis route are presented in reference 16\nFilms were made by spin-coating the sol onto a Pt\/Ti\/SiO2\/Si substrate at 1000\nrpm for 1 min. The coating was then heated at 350 \u00baC for 5 min on a hot-plate. For a\n\u2018standard\u2019 film, crystallisation was carried out at 550 \u00baC. Films for compaction were\nheat-treated at 350 \u00baC and 450 \u00baC for 5 min prior to isopressing at 200 MPa for 1 min\n(Stanstead Fluid Power, Stanstead, England); samples were protected by a double\nlayer of latex during pressing. Films were then heat-treated at 550 \u00baC for 5 min to\ninduce crystallisation.\n Polished sections were obtained by gluing two films face-to face and\nmounting vertically in a resin block; polishing was carried out using a range of\nabrasives with a final polish using colloidal silica. Microstructures were examined\nusing field emission scanning electron microscopy (LEO Model 1530, Oberkochen,\nGermany).\n3. Results and Discussion\n Our new approach to the densification of \u2018thick\u2019 sol-gel films is based on a\nrecognition that the porosity in the final films stems from physical disruption to the\nfilms during organic pyrolysis and the elimination of volatile species which occurs\nduring the hot-plate heat-treatment at temperatures of ~ 300-400 \u00baC. Therefore by\nphysically compacting the porous amorphous film after the pyrolysis stage, in\nprinciple it should be possible to produce a dense amorphous structure which can then\nbe heated in the normal manner at \u2265 550 \u00baC to produce a dense crystalline film. To\nensure complete elimination of organics and decomposition of any  carbonates, the\nfilms were subjected to a second pyrolysis heat-treatment at a slightly higher\ntemperature than normal, 450 \u00baC. Isopressing was used as the means of compaction\nbut because of the strong bonding between film and substrate, the compaction will be\nmost effective normal to the substrate.\n Examination of fracture surfaces can underestimate the amount of porosity in\na film, therefore samples were mounted in resin and carefully polished to expose any\nporosity. The cross-section of such a sample which had been isopressed and at 200\nMPa (and  crystallised at 550 \u00baC), Fig 2, clearly reveals the PZT film, the 100 nm Pt\nelectrode layer and the underlying SiO2\/Si substrate; SEM-EDX elemental analysis\nconfirmed this identification. The layer of glue used to bond the films face-to-face has\nbecome abraded during polishing and appears as a porous layer between the PZT\nfilms in Fig 2.\nCompared to the standard film (Fig 1) the PZT film fabricated by the\npyrolysis-compaction-crystallisation process is substantially more dense, and much\nthinner. The 100 nm pores prevalent in the standard film have disappeared and the\nfilm thickness has reduced from ~ 0.7 \u00b5m to ~0.2 \u00b5m, which is close to the maximum\nreported thickness of films made by the basic metal alkoxide-acetic acid sol-gel route.\nThe corresponding surface microstructure is shown in Fig 3; some regions\ncontained a pattern of 10-20 nm wide features; similarly sized features could also be\nobserved running normal to the substrate in cross-sections viewed at higher\nmagnifications, Fig 2b. This form of localised nanoscale cracking may be a form of\nstress relief in dense films. Indeed  surface microstructures of  films made by other\nsol-gel routes, although not exhibiting macroscale cracking,  often show a secondary\nstructure of ~ 50 nm wide grain boundaries between more densely packed features [8,\n12]; these are likely to be analogous to the fine features displayed in Figs 2b and 3.\nIn future it will be important to determine the optimum pressing pressures and\nheat-treatments for producing maximum density films; simple die-pressing akin to\nthat used for laminating tape-cast layers may also be effective. Varying the applied\npressures may permit added control of porosity which could be useful for pyroelectric\napplications where controlled  porosity can help increase figures of merit (because of\nthe lower permittivity of porous films) [17 ].\nIt will be informative to extend the method to other \u2018thick\u2019 PZT film sol-gel\nroutes which are increasingly being reported because of the technological importance\nof producing films which are a few microns in thickness for micro-transducer and\nother applications. This would provide a comparison of \u2018equivalent dense thickness\u2019\nfor films made by different routes, and indicate the extent to which differences in\nreported headline thickness values are simply a consequence of differing levels of\nporosity.\n4. Conclusions\n A pyrolysis-compaction-crystallisation procedure has successfully been\ndemonstrated as an effective means of sol-gel film densification. The results provide\nan indication as to the extent to which a relatively high value of thickness of a single-\nlayer film may simply be a consequence of its high porosity levels. The porosity is\ncaused by physical disruption to the film structure during pyrolysis and the escape of\norganic decomposition vapours. Sol-gel routes with high  contents of organics present\nafter the initial drying stage are prone to such \u2018bloating\u2019 and increase in film\nthickness. This  porosity also inhibits cracking. The pyrolysis-compaction-\ncrystallisation technique will be a valuable tool in formulating an \u2018equivalent-dense-\nthickness\u2019 scale for evaluating the growing number of sol-gel routes reported to yield\nsingle-layer thickness values \u2265 1 \u00b5m.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors wish to thank R Marshall for his expertise in polishing film sections, and\nJ Earl for assistance with preliminary SEM studies.\nReferences\n1.
