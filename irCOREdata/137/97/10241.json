J. SHERWIN1 AND H. M. BLACKBURN2\n1Department of Aeronautics, Imperial College London, South Kensington Campus,\nLondon SW7 2AZ, UK\n2CSIRO Manufacturing and Infrastructure Technology, PO Box 56, Highett, Vic 3190, Australia\n(Received 2 August 2004 and in revised form 13 December 2004)\nA straight tube with a smooth axisymmetric constriction is an idealized representation\nof a stenosed artery. We examine the three-dimensional instabilities and transition to\nturbulence of steady flow, steady flow plus an oscillatory component, and an idealized\nvascular pulsatile flow in a tube with a smooth 75% stenosis using both linear stability\nanalysis and direct numerical simulation. Steady flow undergoes a weak Coanda-type\nwall attachment and turbulent transition through a subcritical bifurcation, leading\nto hysteretic behaviour with respect to changes in Reynolds number. The pulsatile\nflows become unstable through a subcritical period-doubling bifurcation involving\nalternating tilting of the vortex rings that are ejected from the throat with each pulse.\nThese tilted vortex rings rapidly break down through a self-induction mechanism\nwithin the confines of the tube. While the linear instability modes for pulsatile flow\nhave maximum energy well downstream of the stenosis, we have established using\ndirect numerical simulation that breakdown can gradually propagate upstream\nuntil it occurs within a few tube diameters of the constriction, in agreement with\nprevious experimental observations. At the Reynolds numbers employed in the present\nstudy, transition is localized, with relaminarization occurring further downstream. A\nnon-exhaustive investigation has also been undertaken into the receptivity of the\naxisymmetric shear layer in the idealized physiological pulsatile flow, with the results\nsuggesting it has localized convective instability over part of the pulse cycle.\n1. Introduction\nThe association of arterial disease with flow-related mechanisms has motivated the\nstudy of steady and pulsatile flow within both model and anatomically correct arterial\nmodel stenoses (Berger & Jou 2000). Atherosclerosis and thrombosis are extremely\nimportant and closely linked diseases of the cardiovascular system: atherosclerosis\npredisposes arteries to thrombosis, and the genesis of both is intimately related to wall\nshear rates in the arterial flow. Atherosclerosis involves an accumulation of low-density\nlipoprotein (e.g. cholesterol) in the walls of the large arteries, typically where the local\nwall shear rate is low, and oscillatory (Caro, Fitz-Gerald & Schroter 1971; Wootton &\nKu 1999). The process can be considered as a long-period nonlinear instability of\nthe geometry of the arterial wall, wherein a local constriction can grow through\npromotion of flow separation. The increased pressure losses associated with flow\nseparation can reduce the flow rate and produce ischemia (localized anoxia\/absence\nof oxygen) which is typically used as an indicator for surgical interventions such as\nstenting, angioplasty and bypass operations. Over the past three to four decades there\n298 S. J. Sherwin and H. M. Blackburn\nhave been a number of published works on the topic of flow within stenotic pipes,\nbeginning with experimental studies of flows in idealized axisymmetric stenotic tubes\n(Cassanova & Giddens 1978; Khalifa & Giddens 1981; Ahmed & Giddens 1983,\n1984; Ojha et al. 1989; Ahmed 1998). More recently, computational fluid dynamics\nhas begun to have an impact, through numerical simulations in idealized stenoses, both\naxisymmetric and non-axisymmetric (Long et al. 2001; Mallinger & Drikakis 2002),\nand of stenotic flows with two-dimensional planar geometries derived from MRI\nmeasurements of individual patient geometries (Stroud, Berger & Saloner 2002).\u2020\nFlow instability and transition to turbulence has been a common factor in these\nstudies. Under standard physiological flow conditions, arterial flows are usually consi-\ndered to be laminar, although always unsteady and often with separation. However, in\nthe case of a stenotic pipe flow, the introduction of an inflection point into the velocity\nprofile downstream of the contraction can lead to transition. This typically occurs\nin the present application for Reynolds numbers in the range of a few hundreds to\na few thousands (based on upstream conditions), coinciding with those particularly\nrelevant to physiological conditions.\nThe onset of turbulence has been observed in the laboratory studies, and has led to\ndescription of the flows in statistical terms. While obviously important, the descriptions\nhave arguably not greatly aided physical understanding of the underlying fluid mech-\nanics. This understanding could potentially be derived from numerical simulations;\nhowever, the wide variation in length and time scales involved in transitional and\nturbulent flows makes their numerical simulation quite demanding. This is especially\ntrue when accompanied in the present case by geometrical complexity and the need\nfor description in terms of a number of dimensionless parameters. While the past\nnumerical works have aided our understanding of stenotic flows, nowhere in the\nliterature can be found a fundamental study that examines the stability of the flows,\neven in the simplest case of axisymmetric flow through a smooth constriction, and the\nnature of the subsequent transition. This is our current contribution. Having under-\nstanding of the simplest cases, we will then be in a position to provide perspective on\nand explain the relevance of these mechanisms in more complex configurations.\nIn the present work, we turn our attention to the stability of steady and pulsatile\nflows in an axisymmetric stenotic tube. The approach adopted is to analyse the global\nlinear stability of the axisymmetric flows, both steady and pulsatile, to arbitrary\nthree-dimensional perturbations. As the problem has rotational symmetry about the\ncylindrical axis, it is natural to use Fourier decomposition in the azimuthal direction in\norder to break the general three-dimensional linear stability problem into a set of two-\ndimensional ones, dramatically reducing the size of each individual problem. Once we\nhave the most unstable mode for each flow, we then use full three-dimensional direct\nnumerical simulation (DNS) in order to examine the evolution of their instability\nmodes, onset of turbulence and nonlinear dynamics.\nAs is commonly justified in many works on blood flows in the major arteries,\nNewtonian rheology has been assumed. While the effect of artery wall compliance\nis potentially important, it is often taken to be of secondary significance, and has\nbeen ignored in the present work. For discussion of these assumptions and reviews of\nrecent work on blood flow in arteries, see Ku (1997), Wootton & Ku (1999), Berger &\nJou (2000) and Taylor & Draney (2004).\n\u2020 For purely oscillatory flows in unconstricted straight tubes, instability mechanisms different to\nthose reported in the current paper arise: these have been investigated by Yang & Yih (1977) and\nAkhavan, Kamm & Shapiro (1991).\nThree-dimensional instability and transition of stenotic flow 299\nD Dmin\nL\nr\nz\nFigure 1. Geometrical parameters that define the axisymmetric sinusoidal stenosis.\nThe kinematic and dynamical parameters of the problem are introduced in \u00a7 2. In\norder to keep the study to a reasonable size, our focus is restricted to a single smooth\nstenosis with 75% occlusion and to three simple flows: one steady, two pulsatile.\nIn \u00a7 3, we then discuss the governing equations and concepts of stability analysis\nadopted within this paper. In \u00a7 4, we detail the numerical techniques and resolution\nstudies undertaken to validate the results. In \u00a7 5, we consider instability of steady flow,\nprior to introducing flow pulsatility. Section 6 covers the central topic, instability and\ntransition in our two selected types of pulsatile flow. In that section, we also briefly\nexamine the susceptibility of one of the pulsatile flows to axisymmetric convective\nshear-layer instability, using two-dimensional DNS.\n2. Problem definition: dimensionless groups\nWe consider the steady and pulsatile Newtonian flow through a rigid axisymmetric\nstenosis described by a sinusoidal axial variation where the radius at the minimum\nconstriction is half that of the maximum radius. For the axisymmetric geometry a\n50% reduction in radius necessarily corresponds to a 75% reduction in area. This\nreduction has been chosen for our study based upon medical practice, where a 50%\nreduction in radius is typically given as the level at which a constriction can be\nconfidently identified using medical imaging techniques such as ultrasound. Further, a\n75% occlusion has also been used in many of the previous laboratory and numerical\ninvestigations.\n2.1. Geometrical parameters\nAs shown in figure 1, we consider a pipe of internal diameter D with an axisymmetric\nstenotic region with a radius r(z) that varies over an axial length L, according to the\nform\nr(z) = 0.5Dmin + 0.5(D \u2212 Dmin) sin2(\u03c0z\/L) (\u22120.5\u0001 (z\/L)\u0001 0.5),\nwhere z is centred on the middle of the stenosis. Given this geometry, there are\ntwo independent dimensionless geometric parameters we can define which are the\ndiameter ratio Dmin\/D and the stenosis length \u03bb=L\/D. In the clinical environment\nthe stenosis degree, S, is more commonly used than the diameter ratio and is defined\nas the ratio of the reduction in cross-sectional area to the original area, i.e.\nS = 1 \u2212 (Dmin\/D)2 ,\nIn the following, we have considered a single geometry defined by S =0.75 and \u03bb=2.\n2.2. Flow parameters\nTo complement the geometric factors we must also consider the physiological flow\nparameters which describe our problem. We start by defining an axisymmetric inflow\n300 S. J.

For fully developed laminar\nperiodic flow in a circular tube, the velocity profile components at each temporal\nharmonic can be obtained in an analytic closed form provided by Womersley (1955).\nEach harmonic n has an associated circular frequency \u03c9n =2n\u03c0\/T , with the velocity\ndistribution given through Womersley\u2019s solution in terms of a complex Bessel function\nas\nun(r, t) = Re\n[\nAni\n\u03c1\u03c9n\n(\nJ0\n(\ni3\/2\u03b1 2r\/D\n)\nJ0\n(\ni3\/2\u03b1\n) \u2212 1) exp i\u03c9nt\n]\n, (2.1)\nwhere i= (\u22121)1\/2, \u03c1 is the fluid density and \u03b1=(\u03c9n\/\u03bd)1\/2D\/2 is the Womersley number.\nA further input in the above expression is the value of An which is a complex number\nrepresenting the driving pressure gradient \u2202zp=An exp i\u03c9nt and can be determined\nfrom a specified sectional-average velocity u\u00af(t) at a given harmonic. When n=0, (2.1)\nreduces to the standard parabolic Hagen\u2013Poiseuille profile for steady flow.\nA wide variety of pulsatile flow waveforms are observed in arteries (see e.g. Mills\net al. 1970; McDonald 1974); these vary with position in the arterial system, in\nresponse to exertion, and from individual to individual. We assume that u\u00af(t) is\ndescribed by the mean and two harmonic terms in the form\nu\u00af(t) = u\u00afm[1 + a1 sin(2\u03c0t\/T ) + a2 cos(4\u03c0t\/T )], (2.2)\nand for two cases of non-reversing flow: (a1 = 0.75, a2 = 0) and (a1 = 0.75, a2 =\u22120.75),\nas shown in figure 2. The first is a simple pulsatile waveform of the type considered in\nmany laboratory experiments (Cassanova & Giddens 1978; Ahmed & Giddens 1984;\nOjha et al. 1989), and has Upm =1.75. The second, a more realistic approximation\nof physiologic waveforms since it has a higher peak-to-mean ratio, is obtained using\nThree-dimensional instability and transition of stenotic flow 301\ntwo harmonics and with a1 =\u2212a2 = 0.75. We note that if the magnitude of the two\nharmonics is fixed at 0.75, the phase relationship between them, as defined by (2.2),\nleads to the highest possible peak-to-mean flow ratio, Upm =2.5.\nThe Womersley number, \u03b1, can be interpreted as the ratio of the diameter (or\nradius) to the viscous laminar boundary-layer growth (\u03bdT )1\/2 in time period T . It is\ntherefore the ratio of two sectional length scales and is a commonly used parameter\nin pulsatile flows of biomedical interest. We note, however, that for our problem\nthere is also an axial length scale, associated with the stenosis shape, in the flow\ndirection. The reduced velocity Ured = u\u00afmT \/D can be interpreted as the convective\nlength in diameters that the mean flow moves in time T and therefore introduces an\naxial scale into the parameter. In the following work, we will typically adopt reduced\nvelocity, Ured, in preference to Womersley number, \u03b1, but note that Ured and \u03b1 are\ndependent parameters related by the Reynolds number according to the relation\nUred =\u03c0Re\/(2\u03b1\n2).\nWithin this paper, we consider steady flow (i.e. a1 = a2 = 0) in the Reynolds-\nnumber regime 400\u0001Re\u0001 800. The pulsatile flow given the most attention is the case\n(a1 = 0.75, a2 = 0) for which we have considered the parametric region 2.5\u0001Ured\u0001 7.5\nand 250\u0001Re\u0001 550. For the case (a1 = 0.75, a2 =\u22120.75) we have examined a single\nreduced velocity, Ured =5, over the range 500\u0001Re\u0001 550.\nThe Reynolds-number regime was dictated by the onset of linear instability of\nthe steady and pulsatile flows. In terms of physiological conditions, we note that the\nReynolds-number regime considered for steady flow is relatively high. For pulsatile\nflow, the Reynolds numbers considered are slightly high, although plausible. The\nWomersley numbers for the pulsatile waveforms range from \u03b1=7.2 to 18.6, which is\nalso physiologically reasonable; however, the peak-to-mean flow ratios are somewhat\nlow since physiological waveforms can achieve a value of Upm \u2248 4 (McDonald 1974).\n3. Equations, stability and symmetry\nAssuming the fluid to be Newtonian and the flow incompressible, the relevant\nequations of motion for the primitive (velocity, pressure) variables are the\nincompressible Navier\u2013Stokes equations\n\u2202t u = \u2212A(u) \u2212 \u2207P + \u03bd\u22072u with \u2207 \u00b7 u = 0, (3.1)\nwhere u = u(z, r, \u03b8, t)= (u, v,w)(t) is the velocity field, A(u) represents nonlinear\nadvection terms, P =p\/\u03c1 is the modified pressure and \u03bd is the fluid\u2019s kinematic\nviscosity. The variables z, r , \u03b8 and t are, respectively, the axial, radial, azimuthal\nand time coordinates and u, v and w are the velocity components in the axial,\nradial and azimuthal directions. We can consider the nonlinear terms either in\nconvective form A(u)= u \u00b7 \u2207u, conservative form A(u)=\u2207 \u00b7 uu, or skew-symmetric\nform A(u)= (u \u00b7 \u2207u + \u2207 \u00b7 uu)\/2, which are all equivalent in a continuum setting.\nTaking the pressure to represent the solution of a Poisson equation that has the\ndivergence of the advection terms as forcing, we can consider the Navier\u2013Stokes\nequations in symbolic form as\n\u2202t u = \u2212(I \u2212 \u2207\u2207\u22122\u2207\u00b7)A(u) + \u03bd\u22072u = N(u) + L(u), (3.2)\nwhere the nonlinear operator N contains contributions from both pressure and\nadvection terms, while the linear operator L corresponds to viscous diffusion.\nWhen analysing the linear stability of a flow in terms of its normal modes, we\ndecompose the velocity u into a base flow U and perturbation flow u\u2032: u = U + u\u2032,\nand examine the stability of the perturbation linearized about the base flow. In\n302 S. J. Sherwin and H. M. Blackburn\nthis decomposition, the original nonlinear advection terms are replaced with their\nlinearized equivalent (here for the convective form) \u2202U A(u\u2032)= U \u00b7 \u2207u\u2032 + u\u2032\u00b7\u2207U and in\nsymbolic form we write\n\u2202t u\n\u2032 = \u2202U N(u\u2032) + L(u\u2032) (3.3)\nfor the evolution of the linear perturbation.\nIf the base flow is steady in time, then so is the nonlinear operator \u2202U N . Under the\nassumption of normal modes, u\u2032(t) \u2261 u\u02dc exp \u03b3 t , (3.3) becomes an eigenproblem\n\u03b3 u\u02dc = (\u2202U N + L)u\u02dc, (3.4)\nwhere \u03b3 is an eigenvalue and u\u02dc an eigenfunction, both, in general, appearing in\ncomplex-conjugate pairs. For a finite time increment \u03c4 we have\nu\u2032(t0 + \u03c4 ) = exp[(\u2202U N + L)\u03c4 ]u\u2032(t0), (3.5)\nand we usually try to extract the eigenpairs {\u0393 , u\u02dc} of operator exp [(\u2202U N + L)\u03c4 ]. This\nis because the numerical method to be used, extracts dominant eigenvalues, i.e. those\nof largest modulus, whereas for the steady flow we are ultimately interested in values\nof \u03b3 with the largest real part, i.e. the most unstable. There is a direct correspondence\nbetween the dominant values of \u0393 and the most unstable values of \u03b3 through the\nrelation \u0393 = exp \u03b3\nt .\nIf, on the other hand, the base flow is time-periodic with period T , \u2202U N is still\nlinear but now time-periodic, and\nu\u2032(t0 + T ) = exp\n[\u222b t0+T\nt0\n(\u2202U N + L) dt\n]\nu\u2032(t0). (3.6)\nThe eigenpairs of this Floquet problem are {\u00b5, u\u02dc(t0)} where \u00b5 is a (constant) Floquet\nmultiplier and u\u02dc(t0) is the T -periodic Floquet eigenfunction, evaluated at phase t0. The\nequivalent to the eigenvalues \u03b3 of the time-invariant case are the Floquet exponents\n\u03c3 , related to the multipliers by \u00b5= exp \u03c3T . Floquet modes are unstable for |\u00b5| > 1,\ni.e. when Floquet multipliers leave the unit circle in the complex plane. Again, in\ngeneral, the Floquet multipliers\/exponents and eigenfunctions occur in complex-\nconjugate pairs. Three primary instability scenarios can be identified: (i ) the critical\nFloquet multiplier \u00b5c = + 1, giving a synchronous instability with period T at onset;\n(ii ) \u00b5c =\u22121, giving a period-doubling bifurcation; (iii ) \u00b5c = exp\u00b1i\u03c6, a Neimark\u2013\nSacker bifurcation, which introduces a new secondary period and gives quasi-periodic\nsolutions.\nIt is readily apparent that the structure of (3.5) and (3.6) is the same, except that\nin the former case the time-invariant operators have been taken outside the integral.\nThe conceptual difficulties of numerically constructing the exponential operators are\nreduced once it is appreciated that the action of these operators can be evaluated\nby standard time-integration techniques applied to the linearized evolution equa-\ntion (3.3).\nSince the geometry is axisymmetric, the velocity must be 2\u03c0-periodic in \u03b8 and can\nbe projected exactly onto a set of two-dimensional complex Fourier modes by\nu\u02c6k(z, r, t) =\n1\n2\u03c0\n\u222b 2\u03c0\n0\nu(z, r, \u03b8, t) exp(\u2212ik\u03b8) d\u03b8, (3.7)\nThree-dimensional instability and transition of stenotic flow 303\nwhere k is an integer wavenumber. This projection has the Fourier series recon-\nstruction\nu(z, r, \u03b8, t) =\n\u221e\u2211\nk=\u2212\u221e\nu\u02c6k(z, r, t) exp(ik\u03b8). (3.8)\nThe Fourier-transformed equations of motion and axial boundary conditions for\nthe velocity and pressure (and their perturbations) in cylindrical coordinates are\ndescribed in detail by Blackburn (2002) and Blackburn & Sherwin (2004). Our base\nflows are both axisymmetric\/two-dimensional, i.e. U\u0302k = 0, k \u0007= 0, and two-component,\ni.e. U \u2261 (U,V, 0). In the numerical stability analysis, we take advantage of linearity,\nwhich decouples the stability problem for each u\u02c6\u2032k .\nThe axisymmetric base flows have rotational symmetry about the z-coordinate axis,\ni.e. the spatial symmetry group of the base flows is O(2), broken by any three-\ndimensional instability. This has consequences for the possible forms of three-\ndimensional instabilities. If the eigenvalues\/Floquet multipliers of the instability\nmodes are real, then the bifurcations occur through a pitchfork of revolution,\ni.e. the mode shapes are aligned at arbitrary, but fixed, azimuthal coordinate in\nthe tube; an azimuthal traverse corresponds to a revolution of the pitchfork. For\ncomplex-conjugate pair eigenvalues there are two cases to consider: standing-wave\ntype solutions, which again bifurcate through a pitchfork of revolution, producing\nmode shapes at arbitrary, but fixed, azimuthal coordinates, and travelling-wave (or,\nin this system, rotating-wave) type solutions that bifurcate in \u03b8-conjugate pairs, one\nrotating in a +\u03b8 sense, the other in a \u2212\u03b8 sense: only one of the pairs will be observed\nin practice. In this case, the imaginary part of the eigenvalue\/multiplier is associated\nwith the precession speed of the rotating wave. At linear onset, the eigenvalues for\nthe standing- and rotating-wave solutions are identical, and the mode shapes of the\nstanding waves are symmetric combinations of those for the rotating waves. Under\nnonlinear evolution (i.e. DNS), however, the standing and rotating wave solution\nbranches are distinct, and at most one has stable solutions.\nIn order to account for the various possibilities, we initially use perturbation\nvelocities with restricted symmetry, and also arbitrarily align the mode shape at\n\u03b8 =0:\n(u\u2032, v\u2032, w\u2032)(z, r, \u03b8, t) = (u\u2032 cos k\u03b8, v\u2032 cos k\u03b8,w\u2032 sin k\u03b8)(z, r, t), (3.9)\nwhich corresponds to taking u\u02c6\u2032k , v\u02c6\u2032k purely real and w\u02c6\u2032k purely imaginary. This\ncombination passes unaltered through the linearized Navier\u2013Stokes equation when the\nbase flow is two-component, and is sufficient except when the eigenvalues are complex-\nconjugate pairs, in which case full-complex perturbations must also be introduced, in\norder to capture the shape of the travelling-wave modes (see e.g. Blackburn & Lopez\n2003a, b). In fact, for the present problem, we have so far only observed instability\nmodes with real eigenvalues, so the above form is adequate. When carrying out\nDNS studies, the full complex structure of all modes is used, removing the symmetry\nconstraint implicit in (3.9).\n4. Numerical techniques\nThe same underlying spatial and temporal discretizations were applied both to\nintegrate the Navier\u2013Stokes equations (3.1) in direct numerical simulation (DNS),\nand their linearized equivalents used to evolve perturbation velocities (3.3). These\nnumerical methods are outlined in \u00a7 4.1 and this is followed in \u00a7 4.3 by those relevant\nto stability analysis techniques.\n304 S. J. Sherwin and H. M.

Treatment of the evolution equations\nFor time evolution of both the full and linearized Navier\u2013Stokes equations, we rely\non standard (nodal-Gauss\u2013Lobatto\u2013Legendre) spectral elements in (z, r) and Fourier\nexpansions if required in the azimuthal \u03b8-direction. This spatial discretization was\ncoupled with a second-order-time velocity correction time-integration scheme. The\ndevelopment of this numerical method for DNS has been described in detail by\nBlackburn & Sherwin (2004), where full spectral convergence in both the meridional\nsemi-plane and in azimuth was demonstrated. The application of the method to\nlinearized Navier\u2013Stokes evolution, including appropriate boundary conditions, has\nalso previously been described by Blackburn (2002). As a consequence, we refer\nthe interested reader to these other publications for more detail on the numerical\nsimulation techniques employed.\nOne aspect we highlight here concerns the discrete formulation of the advection\nterms. We have found that for three-dimensional cylindrical-coordinate DNS, the\nskew-symmetric form A(u)= (u \u00b7 \u2207u + \u2207 \u00b7 uu)\/2 provides superior numerical stability\nto the convective form A(u)= u \u00b7 \u2207u, and have used it exclusively in that application.\nOn the other hand, we use the convective form and its linearized equivalent\nfor computing two-dimensional\/axisymmetric flows and evolution of linearized\nperturbations for stability analysis. The use of convective form in the stability analysis\nis consistent with the work of Wilhelm & Kleiser (2001) who found that this form\ndoes not lead to numerical linear instability in spectral element type discretizations.\n4.2. Mesh layout and resolution\nThe computational meshes used in the following numerical calculations are shown\nin figure 3. The first domain used for the majority of calculations is shown in\nThree-dimensional instability and transition of stenotic flow 305\nfigure 3(a) and consists of 743 elemental regions. In each element two-dimensional\nmapped tensor-product Lagrange-interpolant shape functions based on the Gauss\u2013\nLobatto\u2013Legendre nodes were applied. At polynomial order Np =7, this elemental\ndiscretization corresponds to approximately 38 000 local degrees of freedom in each\nmeridional semiplane. The domain extended 5D upstream and 45D downstream of\nthe throat. As shown in figure 3(b), a fine radial mesh spacing was adopted in\nthe region of the stenosis where two layers each of 5% of the local radius were\napplied. At z\/D \u2248 7, the radial mesh spacing was coarsened to allow a uniform axial\nspacing of 0.5D to be applied to the outflow. For the two harmonic waveforms\nwhere a1 = 0.75, a2 =\u22120.75 in (2.2), we required a domain with a longer outflow as\nshown in figure 3(c). This mesh contains 915 elemental regions and when Np =9\nthis corresponds to approximately 91 000 local degrees of freedom in each meridional\nsemiplane. The two meshes are similar up to z\/D \u2248 7, the second mesh then has radial\ntransitions at z\/D \u2248 11, 15 and 20.\nThe long outflow lengths of both meshes were found to be necessary primarily to\nobtain satisfactory convergence of the pulsatile flow stability analyses. As will be seen\nlater, the linear instability modes for both steady and pulsatile flows are significantly\nextensive in the axial direction. The need for this apparently extreme domain length\ncan be understood heuristically by considering a case where Ured =7.5 with a stenosis\nof S =0.75. For this problem there is a fourfold increase in the sectionally averaged\nvelocity at the throat of the stenosis and so in the absence of any resistive force\nthis flow could theoretically propagate through a length of order 4\u00d7 7.5D=30D in\none pulsatile cycle. A further significant feature of the mesh design was the need to\nadequately resolve shear layers, both next to the wall of the stenosis, and as they\npropagate in the elongated separation zone further downstream. The fine resolution\naround the stenosis where the highest sectional flow rates are observed, results in\na reasonably restrictive time step dictated by CFL stability considerations. This\nrestriction arises owing to the explicit treatment of advection terms adopted in the\nnumerical integration of the Navier\u2013Stokes equations (Blackburn & Sherwin 2004).\nUltimately the spectral element layout and polynomial order adopted in the\nmeridional semiplane was decided on the basis of satisfactory convergence of stability\nanalysis results. We have found in past work (e.g. Blackburn 2002; Blackburn & Lopez\n2003 b) that mesh designs which deliver adequate convergence in stability analyses\nalso do so for DNS studies, consistent with points made by Zang (1991). Typical\nresolution results will be provided in the following section. However, prior to carrying\nout these studies, and all other stability analyses, it was always necessary to ascertain\nthat the base flows in question were either sufficiently close to an asymptotic state (for\nsteady flows) or a periodic one (for pulsatile flows). In all the base-flow calculations,\nflow time series data were extracted at z\/D=0, 1, 22, 43 and r\/D=0.25. For steady\nflows, the base flow was considered to be close enough to an asymptotic state when\nthe velocities converged to the local steady-state value within a relative error of order\n1\u00d7 10\u22124. In practice, this typically required a total run time of order t u\u00afm\/D=75\nafter any parameter change. For the pulsatile computations, the base flow was run\nfor a sufficient number of cycles so that the mean flow had time to convect through\nthe entire computational domain. For example at Ured =5.0, the flow was run for\n10 cycles after any parameter change. Phase-plane plots of the z-component versus\nr-component velocities at each extraction point were then checked for the final two\ncycles to ensure time periodicity of the flow within visual limits, again to a typical\nrelative accuracy of order 1\u00d7 10\u22124 or better. It should be noted that through these\nmethods of computing and checking the base flows, we have established that none\n306 S. J. Sherwin and H. M.

In\n\u00a7 6.4.3, it will be demonstrated that a convective shear-layer instability is possible\nwhen high-frequency forcing is introduced into the inflow.\n4.3. Stability analysis methodology\nThe numerical methods employed for stability analysis of both steady and pulsatile\nflow follow those outlined in Tuckerman & Barkley (2000), and previously described\nand used in other works (e.g. Barkley & Henderson 1996). The code used in the present\nstudy has been validated against the circular cylinder wake secondary stability analysis\nof Barkley & Henderson, see Blackburn & Lopez (2003a), and against experimental\nand DNS results for oscillatory swirling flows (Blackburn 2002). For both steady and\ntime-periodic flows, the analysis is based on a Krylov-subspace iteration of successive\nfinite increments of (initially random) perturbations through the linearized equa-\ntions (3.5) and (3.6) using an Arnoldi method to extract the dominant eigenpairs of the\nexponential operators in the equations. For Floquet analysis, the data used to supply\nthe T -periodic base flow are approximated through Fourier-series reconstruction from\na limited number (typically 256) of time-slices obtained from two-dimensional DNS.\nThis number of time-slices is somewhat higher than employed in previous applications\n(typically 32 or 64), as the dimensionless frequency content of the base flows here is\nsomewhat broader.\n4.4. Resolution studies\nAn identical spectral element mesh to that adopted for computing base flows (see\nfigure 3a) was used for the steady and Floquet stability analysis with a single harmonic\nwaveform. The tolerance placed on the Arnoldi iteration residual (see e.g. Saad 1992)\nas a stopping criterion was 1\u00d7 10\u22126. To determine the appropriate polynomial order\nfor the base flow and also our stability analyses a series of convergence tests were\nperformed. In table 1, we show the results of a polynomial-order convergence test\nfor the three-dimensional instability in the k=1 azimuthal Fourier modes. Two cases\nare considered. The first involved the sensitivity of the leading eigenvalue in the\nsteady-flow stability analysis at Re =800. The second demonstrates the sensitivity of\nthe Floquet multiplier for analysis at Ured =2.5 and Re=400. Both these test cases\nare quite close to the onset of instability for the relevant flows. From this table,\nwe observe that for a polynomial order of Np =7, the variation of the eigenvalue\nobtained by incrementing the polynomial degree by one is of order 1\u00d7 10\u22124 and\nthe variation of the multiplier is of order 1\u00d7 10\u22123.

As a result, Np =7 was chosen for all sub-\nsequent investigations, except for the two-harmonic case, where we have used Np =9.\nFinally, time-step independence checks were also performed at Ured =2.5, Re =400,\nNp =7 and k=1, by considering values of \ntu\u00af\/D=1\/7168, 1\/9216 and 1\/12 288;\nchanging the time step had no effect on the computed value of \u00b5 to four-figure\naccuracy.\n5. Steady inlet flow\n5.1. Base flow characteristics\nThe main characteristics of the steady base flow are indicated in figure 4 where we\nshow streamlines, vorticity contours and representative velocity profiles for the flow\nat Re=750. From mass flow considerations in the 75% stenosis, it is evident that\nthe sectionally averaged velocity at the throat of the stenosis reaches a values of 4 u\u00afm.\nThe flow is unable to remain attached during the stenosis expansion and a constrained\nlaminar jet is formed in the centre of the pipe, as highlighted by the vorticity contours\nin figure 4(b). The axisymmetric jet establishes a recirculation region immediately past\nthe stenosis, as indicated by the streamlines, which extends downstream to approx-\nimately z\/D=16.2. Under the action of viscous diffusion, the central core of the jet\nthen decays back to the Hagen\u2013Poiseuille solution. The velocity profiles of figure 4(c)\nshow the axial velocity distribution as a function of the radius at fixed axial locations\nof z\/D=1, 7, 15, 23 and 39. From this plot we observe that even at z\/D=39 the\nPoiseuille solution is not fully re-established, as the centreline velocity is 20% higher\nthan its asymptotic value of 2u\u00afm.\n5.2.

The critical Reynolds number,\nRec =722, is established by interpolation (inset).\nReynolds number for growth of the linearized perturbation is found to be Rec =722,\nwhich is based on a cubic spline fit through the data.\n5.3. Direct numerical simulation\nIn order to study the nonlinear behaviour of the instability, a small perturbation flow\ncomponent derived from the leading instability mode is added to an unstable base flow,\nand the combination is evolved to saturation. Results for Re =750, approximately\n4% greater than Rec, are shown in figure 6. The diagnostic used in this plot is the\ndimensionless amount of flow kinetic energy contained in each azimuthal Fourier\nmode k:\nEk =\n1\n2A u\u00af2m\n\u222b\nA\nu\u02c6k\u00b7u\u02c6\u2217k r dA, (5.1)\nwhere A is the area of the two-dimensional meridional semiplane and u\u02c6\u2217k denotes\nthe complex conjugate of the velocity data in the kth Fourier mode. The number of\nazimuthal Fourier modes chosen for this calculation was Nk =32 (64 planes of data\nin azimuth), which is considered to be adequate on the basis that after saturation,\nthe energies in the non-axisymmetric modes span approximately three orders of\nmagnitude. The total number of mesh points for this simulation is approximately\n2.4 million.\nThe dotted line in figure 6 indicates the exponential growth rate for k=1, predicted\nfrom the linear stability analysis and is in close agreement with the DNS results. Note\nthat while the initial growth in the three-dimensional perturbation is exponential, for\nt u\u00afm\/D\u0002 400 it becomes faster than exponential prior to saturation, indicating that\nthe bifurcation is of subcritical type. We will return to this point in \u00a7 \u00a7 5.4.2 and 5.4.3.\n5.4. Discussion\n5.4.1. Characteristics of the linear instability mode\nIn figure 7, we see features of the most unstable eigenmode (at k=1) for Re =750.\nThe eigenmode arises downstream of the throat of the stenosis, and is elongated in\nThree-dimensional instability and transition of stenotic flow 309\n0\n\u20132\n\u20134\n\u20136lo\ng \nE\nk\n\u20138\n\u201310\n0 200 400\ntum\/D\n600 800\n\u2013\nk = 0\n1\n2\n3\nFigure 6.

The perturbation axial velocity (figure 7a) is positive at the top of\nthe tube and negative at the bottom, which is accompanied by much weaker cross-\nflow perturbation velocities, shown at z\/D=5 (figure 7c). Isosurfaces of streamwise\nperturbation vorticity (figure 7b) reveal a quadrupole arrangement that reaches\nupstream to the throat of the stenosis, where the base flow separates from the wall.\nFinally, figure 7(d ) shows an isosurface of azimuthal vorticity of a linear combination\nof the base flow and the most unstable eigenmode.\nWhile the strongest perturbation pressures (not shown) produce a downward force\njust past the separation line within the stenosis which mainly affects flow in the\nrecirculation region, further downstream, the axial perturbation velocities induce a\nweak cross-flow pressure gradient and flow, as demonstrated in figure 7(c). Therefore\nthe perturbation flow tends to deflect the centreline of the enclosed jet away from the\ntube\u2019s axis of symmetry, promoting a mild Coanda-type attachment. Although the\nfirst symmetry-breaking transition in a two-dimensional expansion or constriction is\nalso of a Coanda-type instability, see Sobey & Drazin (1986), in the two-dimensional\nchannel, the instability occurs at far lower Reynolds number (O(10)) and is far\nstronger in its deflection.\nWe also recall that the azimuthal orientation of the mode is driven by the use of\na particular expansion basis (3.9), and that the mode shown is one instance of the\nazimuthally symmetric pitchfork of bifurcating modes.\n5.4.2. Nonlinear saturation\nAs observed in \u00a7 5.3, the growth to saturation in the three-dimensional modes (see\nfigure 6) is initially faster than exponential, which becomes increasingly apparent for\nt u\u00afm\/D \u0002 400. The implication is that the normal form for the bifurcation is (to fifth\norder) of type\nD\nu\u00afm\nd\u03c8\ndt\n= \u03b3\u03c8 + \u03b21|\u03c8 |2\u03c8 \u2212 \u03b22|\u03c8 |4\u03c8, (5.2)\nwhere \u03c8 represents the amplitude of the instability mode, \u03b3 is the linear growth rate,\n\u03b2i are positive constants, and that the bifurcation is subcritical. We can therefore\nexpect hysteretic behaviour with respect to changes in Reynolds number near the\ncritical value.\nThe non-axisymmetric modal energies in figure 6 are related to the squared\namplitude of the perturbation \u03c8 . In figure 8, the growth in E1\/21 is plotted as\nrepresenting \u03c8 , together with the exponential growth corresponding to the leading\neigenvalue derived from the linear stability analysis, and that of a nonlinear model\nof form (5.2), with fitted values of \u03b21 and \u03b22. It is seen that up until the onset of\ntransition, the normal form for the bifurcation represents the perturbation growth\nwell. Using (5.2), the computed Re-dependence of \u03b3 (see inset, figure 5), and the\nfitted values of \u03b21 and \u03b22 (taken to be Re-independent), an approximate bifurcation\ndiagram can be computed \u2013 this is shown as an inset to figure 8.\n5.4.3. Turbulent flow\nFollowing saturation, the flow becomes highly unsteady and undergoes local\ntransition to turbulence. This is indicated by the variation in the axisymmetric\ncomponent of kinetic energy (which on a linear scale has a variation of approximately\n\u00b15% about the mean value), and also in the the non-axisymmetric components, which\nhave proportionately much larger fluctuations: all non-axisymmetric modes exhibit\nlarge fluctuations on a time scale \nt u\u00afm\/D \u223c 35.\nThree-dimensional instability and transition of stenotic flow 311\n0.1\n\u03c8\n\u03c8\n0 200 400\ntum\/D\n600 800\n\u2013\n0.1\n0\n400\nDNS data (mode 1)\nexponential growth\nthree-term model\n600 800\nRec\nRe\nFigure 8.

The three-term model fit is for (5.2). Inset: approximate bifurcation diagram, with observed\nRe-range of turbulent solutions indicated by hatching.\nIn order to illustrate the nature of the final state of the flow and the mechanics\nof these long time-scale fluctuations, we show in figure 9 a set of visualizations\nof instantaneous vorticity isosurfaces, computed at equal time intervals over\n\nt u\u00afm\/D=35, together with a plot indicating the time series of energy in azimuthal\nmodes k=0 and k=1. The elongated isosurfaces that reach upstream into the stenosis\nare of azimuthal vorticity: these serve to indicate the location and structure of the\njet\u2019s shear layer. At the initial time (figure 9a), the jet is deflected towards the top\nof the tube. At approximately 5D downstream of the stenosis (i.e. at z\/D \u2248 5), there\nare signs of shear-layer oscillation; at z\/D \u2248 10 there is a turbulent breakdown. From\nthe time series, it can be seen that the energy in the k=1 mode is about to reach\na maximum at this instant. In figure 9(b), the turbulent breakdown has progressed\nupstream to lie at z\/D \u2248 4, and the time series shows that the energy in the k=1 mode\nis falling. In figures 9(c)\u20139(f ), the turbulent patch washes downstream. At figure 9(g),\nthe energy in the k=1 mode is again near a maximum, the turbulent burst begins at\nz\/D \u2248 10, and shear-layer oscillations are evident. However, the jet\u2019s deflection is now\ntowards the bottom of the tube. Thus the long time-scale oscillations are associated\nwith a flapping of the jet, accompanied by cyclic axial movements in the location of\nits turbulent breakdown.\nAs we have mentioned above, the nature of growth to saturation in the non-\naxisymmetric modes at Re =750 indicates that the bifurcation to three-dimensional\nbehaviour is subcritical, and we can then expect there to be hysteretic behaviour with\nrespect to changes in Reynolds number near the critical value 722. Additional DNS\nruns have been made, commencing with the asymptotic\/turbulent state at Re =750,\nin which the Reynolds number is decremented in steps, followed at each level by\npassage of sufficient simulation time for the flow state to be assessed. Following\nthis method, we have found that the flow remains three-dimensional and turbulent\ndown to Re \u2248 688, less than the linear critical value, confirming the presence of\nhysteresis \u2013 the lower limit is indicated by the hatched region at the top of the inset\nin figure 8.

Eventually with reducing\nReynolds numbers, these decreases become terminal and the flow re-laminarizes.\n5.4.4. Comparison to previous experimental studies\nOur observations are consistent with the experimental results obtained for steady\nflow by Cassanova & Giddens (1978) and Ahmed & Giddens (1983). Cassanova &\nGiddens considered both \u2018contoured\u2019 and \u2018sharp edged\u2019 stenoses. Their inflow\ncondition was provided by a smoothly converging inlet which created a \u2018velocity\nprofile entering the occlusion [which] was flat over 80% of the tube diameter\u2019 (i.e.\ninconsistent with fully developed Poiseuille flow), and the contours of the stenoses were\ncomposed of intersecting circular arcs. They report flow disturbances downstream\nof a 75%-occlusion smooth stenosis at Re =635, although in their figure 3 the\n\u2018disturbances\u2019 shown in the first few diameters downstream of the stenosis appear to\nbe more consistent with shear-layer oscillations than with developed turbulence.\nThe experiments with steady flow in Ahmed & Giddens (1983) employed smooth\nstenoses with fully developed Poiseuille inflow. When considering a 75%-occlusion\ncosine stenosis with a stenosis length of \u03bb=2 (i.e. the same as considered here),\nnarrowband discrete frequency oscillations were noted at Re =500.

As for Cassanova & Giddens (1978), critical Reynolds numbers\nare not recorded.\nA reasonable interpretation of these results, taken as a whole, is that for stenotic\ngeometries similar to or the same as those that we have employed, the onset of\nturbulence occurred between Re =500 and Re =1000, and could propagate upstream\nto z\/D \u2248 4, consistent with our results. Examination of the visualization data suggests\nthat the \u2018discrete frequencies\u2019 are very likely associated with shear-layer oscillations,\nwhich may have been triggered by upstream noise, and which of course is absent in\nour simulations.\n6. Pulsatile flow\nHaving dealt with instability of the steady flow, we now turn to consider single-\nand two-harmonic pulsatile flows (see figure 2).\n6.1. Base flow characteristics\n6.1.1. Single harmonic waveform\nFor a single harmonic pulsatile waveform, within the Reynolds number and reduced\nvelocity range considered, the base flow characteristics were similar to those shown\nin figure 10. In this figure we plot the streamwise velocity and azimuthal vorticity\ncontours over the same range at four instants in the sinusoidal cycle. The figure\nincludes the axial range \u22121\u0001 z\/D\u0001 7.5 and is at a Reynolds number of Re=400\nand reduced velocity of Ured =2.5 (\u03b1=15.9). As indicated by the time trace on the\nright-hand side of figure 10, the instants considered correspond to the maximum, mean\n314 S. J. Sherwin and H. M.

Azimuthal vorticity in the meridional plane of the axisymmetric base flow at the\nmaximum point of the puslatile cycle for (a) Re =400, Ured =2.5, (\u03b1=15.9) and (b) Re =415,\nUred =5.0, (\u03b1=11.4).\ndeceleration, minimum and mean acceleration instances of the sectionally averaged\npulsatile velocity waveform.\nThe primary feature of the base flow is a plug-like jet which develops at the stenosis\nduring the accelerating part of the cycle. At the front of this jet, a vorticity ring is\ngenerated that initially propagates down the pipe at a relatively constant speed despite\nthe subsequent deceleration of the average flow.\nIn figure 10(a), we observe the early development of the plug-like jet, and the\nvorticity ring associated with the strong gradient in the axial flow at the front of the jet.\nAt this point in the pulsatile cycle, the sectionally averaged velocity away from the\nstenosis is u\u00af\/u\u00afm =1.75. This can be compared with the flow immediately downstream\nof the emerging jet at z\/D=5 in figure 10(a), where there is a centreline velocity of\nuc\/u\u00afm \u2248 3, while in the core of the jet at z\/D=1.5 the velocity is uc\/u\u00afm \u2248 7.8. These\nvalues are consistent with the centreline velocities of the straight pipe solution which\nfrom equation (2.1) is uc\/u\u00afm =2.8 and the peak throat velocity which from mass\nconservation considerations is 4\u00d7 1.75u\u00afm =7u\u00afm. From divergence considerations, we\nknow that a high spatial gradient of the axial flow at the front of the jet is associated\nwith a strong radial flow. The maximum magnitude of the radial flow is approximately\ntwice u\u00afm and occurs at z\/D \u2248 5.\nFrom the vorticity plot of figure 10(a) we observe that the strong secondary flow\ndue to the axial spatial gradient in velocity is associated with role up of the jet shear\nlayer into a vortex ring. As the sectionally averaged flow decelerates and reaches\nits minimum (figures 10c and d ) the jet at the stenosis dies away, but the vortex\nring continues to propagate down the pipe. An indication of the vortex ring strength\ncan be implied by the centreline axial velocity at the location of the ring. The peak\ncentreline axial velocity relative to the mean flow, u\u00afm, in the vicinity of the vortex\nring is approximately 7.8, 8.3, 7.3 and 7.4 in figures 10(a) to 10(d), respectively. Note\nthat the mean sectional velocity ranges over 0.25\u0001 u\u00afm\u0001 1.75.\nThe subsequent cycles generate similar vortex rings which continue to advect down\nthe tube.

From this figure we observe that the intial separation\nbetween two sequential vortex rings is approximately 7D. In figure 11(b), we show\nthe azimuthal vorticity at Re =415, Ured =5, (\u03b1=11.4) using the same contour levels.\nFor these parameters we observe that the separation between two sequential vortex\nrings has increased to approximately 14D, which is consistent with the doubling\nof the period of the base flow cycle at this reduced velocity (all other parameters\nbeing held constant). Analogously, the separation at Re =500, Ured =7.5 (\u03b1=10.2)\nwas observed to be approximately z\/D=20. Although the separation of the vortices\nseems to approximately scale with reduced velocity, the strength of the first vortex ring\nis notably higher when Ured =2.5. At Ured =2.5, the local peak vorticity in the vortex\nring shown in figure 11(a) is approximately 60u\u00afm\/D as compared to approximately\n45u\u00afm\/D when Ured =7.5 at the same point in the pulsatile cycle.\n6.1.2. Two-harmonic waveform\nFor the two-harmonic waveform with \u03b11 = 0.75, \u03b12 =\u22120.75 in equation (2.2) the\nbase flow axial velocity and vorticity is shown in figure 12 at Re =425, Ured =5\n(\u03b1=11.5). In this figure we have plotted the same time instances as a function of the\ntime period previously considered in figure 10. As indicated on the right-hand side of\nthis figure, the two-harmonic waveform could as an approximation be considered as\ntwo single-harmonic waveforms, the first having a peak magnitude of u\u00af\/u\u00afm =2.5 and\nthe second having a peak of u\u00af\/u\u00afm =1.\nThe reduced velocity considered in figure 12 is double that of the case in figure 10.\nAll other constants being held fixed, a doubling of the reduced velocity can be\n316 S.

(a\u2013d ) correspond to the instants shown in figure 12 (a\u2013d ), respectively.\nconsidered as a doubling of the time period T between figure 10 and figure 12. It\nis therefore possible to draw an analogy between each half-period of the waveform\nin figure 12 and the single harmonic waveform considered in figure 10. Under this\nanalogy, it is appropriate to compare figure 12(a and b) with figure 10(a and c)\nsince they represent the maximum and minimum time instances of the sectionally\naveraged velocity waveforms. However, in the two-harmonic waveform, the strength\nof the peak is now u\u00afmax =2.5 as opposed to 1.75, and the peak centreline velocity\nat z\/D=2.5 for the flow in figure 12(a) is uc\/u\u00afm =10.6. This increase in velocity\nnaturally increases the strength of the vortex ring generated at the front of the jet.\nFurther, this is consistent with the peak sectional velocity at the throat of the stenosis\nof 4\u00d7 2.5\u00d7 u\u00afm =10u\u00afm. As shown in figure 12(c and d ) the smaller peak in the second\nhalf of the two-harmonic pulsatile cycle produces a second weaker vortex ring. The\ncentreline velocity at z\/D=0.75 at the instant of figure 12(c) is 4.5u\u00afm. Consistent\nwith our previous comments, we observe that the reduced strength of the second\nvortex leads to a slower propagation down the pipe compared to the first vortex ring\ngenerated by the primary peak in the flow waveform.\nFigure 13 shows the azimuthal vorticity in the meridional plane at the same phases\nas for figure 12, but over the extended region \u22121\u0001 z\/D\u0001 15. In figure 13(a) at z\/D=2\nand figure 13(b) at z\/D=6.5 we observe the primary vortex ring corresponding to the\ndominant peak in the velocity waveform, propagating down the pipe. Also evident in\nthese figures is the secondary vortex (z\/D=6.5 in figure 13a) generated by the second\npeak in the waveform from the previous cycle. In figure 13(c), we subsequently see\nthe generation of a new secondary vortex ring at the stenosis throat associated with\nthe second peak in the velocity waveform. However, at z\/D=11, we also observe the\namalgamation of the primary vortex ring from the current cycle with the secondary\nvortex ring from the previous cycle. The amalgamation leads to a weaker combined\nvortex ring in figure 13(d ) where the maximum centreline velocity has decreased from\n9.4 at z\/D=11 in figure 13(c) to 7.7 at z\/D=13.5 in figure 13(d ).\n6.2. Floquet analysis\nIn figure 14, we present summary results of Floquet stability analyses for a range of\ndifferent pulsatile flows.

In all cases,\nthe leading Floquet multipliers are real and negative.\ncase. Also indicated by the inset plots within this figure are the corresponding pulsatile\nwaveforms. It should be noted that for all the cases we have considered, the largest\nmultipliers are real and negative: the leading modes all arise through period-doubling\nbifurcations with \u00b5c =\u22121. Also, as was the case for the instability of the steady flow,\nthe most unstable eigenmode always corresponds to the first azimuthal Fourier mode,\nk=1.\n6.3. Direct numerical simulation\nFollowing the Floquet analysis, we initiated DNS at Re =400, Ured =2.5 with a linear\ncombination of the base flow and the most unstable eigenmode, projected to Nk =16\n(32 planes of data in azimuth); figure 15 shows the evolution of kinetic energies in\nthe azimuthal Fourier modes, analogous to figure 6 for the steady flow. Following\nan equilibration of energies at early times, there is an initial exponential growth\nphase (indicated by the dotted line based upon the Floquet analysis in the figure)\nthat lasts until t\/T \u2248 30, after which the energy grows faster than exponentially\nuntil an initial nonlinear saturation takes place at t\/T \u2248 40. As was the case for\nthe steady flow at Re =750, this faster-than-exponential growth indicates that the\nbifurcation is subcritical, although we have not followed this matter up in detail\nhere. Succeeding this initial saturation, there follows a much longer transition to the\nasymptotic state at t\/T \u223c 280. In this state, the energies in the non-axisymmetric\nmodes span approximately three orders of magnitude, as was the case for the steady\nflow DNS, but here the number of gridpoints is half, approximately 1.2 million.\n6.4. Discussion\n6.4.1. Characteristics of linear instability modes\nIn figure 16 we illustrate the characteristics of the base flow and leading eigenmode\nfor the single-harmonic flow at Re =400, Ured =2.5, at a single phase (t0 = 0) in the\npulse cycle.

Within the length of tube represented, five base flow pulses can\nbe discerned (the peak of the first pulse occurs at z\/D \u2248 6.5, while the last pulse is\nvery weak).\nAs seen previously, the magnitude of the velocity pulse in the base flow falls with\ndistance down the tube, as the flow re-adjusts to the Womersley flow conditions\nthat would be found without the stenosis. For the first three base flow pulses, the\nseparation remains relatively constant; however, after this point (z\/D \u2248 20), the speed\nof propagation falls and the pulses become closer together. The strength of the\nFloquet mode initially increases with distance downstream, reaching a maximum at\nz\/D \u2248 20, before falling back as the strength of the pulses in the base flow decays.\nIt can be seen that the sign of the perturbation velocity alternates on any axial\ntraverse at a fixed radius: this is directly related to the period-doubling nature of the\ninstability.\nAs highlighted in figure 16(e), the perturbation acts to provide an overturning\nmoment on each velocity pulse of the base flow \u2013 and the sign of this moment\nalternates on successive pulses. The overturning flow can be seen in the perturbation\nvelocity vectors. In terms of vorticity, the perturbation tends to alternately tilt the\nvortex rings that are ejected from the stenosis during each successive pulse: the down-\nwash from the tail of the instability that grows on any one ring induces the opposite\ntilt in its successor. The influence of this alternating tilting will also be seen in the\nDNS results to be presented in figure 17, as will be discussed in \u00a7 6.4.2. We note\nthat this type of instability is distinct from those relevant to flows in constricted\ntwo-dimensional channels, where \u2018vorticity waves\u2019 and shear-layer instabilities are\nobserved (Sobey 1985; Pedley 2000). However, the nature of the instability does bear\nsome similarity to the bifurcation of free jets observed by Glezer (see Saffman 1981)\nand Reynolds et al. (2003).\nAs the reduced velocity for the single-harmonic waveform is increased from\nUred =2.5 to 5 and then 7.5, we recall that the pulse separations in the base flows\nalso increase. However, in the latter two cases the peak eigenmode magnitude is\nassociated with the second rather than the third pulse, as occurs when Ured =2.5.\nWe recall that the initial strength of the first vortex ring grows weaker as Ured\nis increased. In contrast, for the two-harmonic waveform where Ured =5 the peak\neigenmode levels are associated with the third pulse from the stenosis. Although\nthe pulse separations for the single- and double-harmonic waveforms are similar\nwhen Ured =5 (see figures 11 and 13), the initial vortex is much stronger, having\napproximately double the peak vorticity in the two-harmonic waveform case. We\ntherefore observe that the initial strength of the vortex ring may dictate how far the\nvortex ring must propagate while decaying in strength before the period doubling\ninstability dominates. The alignment of the peak eigenmode energy with the third\nrather than the second pulse-front in the case of the two-harmonic inflow waveform\nalso explains the need for the longer-outflow domain (figure 3c) for this investigation.\nFinally we note that, with all other parameters fixed, the shorter the time period\nof the oscillation, the smaller the reduced velocity. Equivalently, the higher the\nWomersley number, then the lower will be the critical Reynolds number, as is\nindicated by the values presented in figure 14. If the instability is promoted by an\ninteraction between subsequent pulses, then the increased separation at higher Ured\nmay require higher Reynolds numbers in order to overcome viscous damping on the\nvelocity induced by one vortex ring at the location of another, and allow unstable\ngrowth to occur. The trend of higher reduced velocity leading to a lower critical\n320 S. J. Sherwin and H. M.

Downstream of the stenosis, the first group of structures\nshows a ring deforming during the final stages of the tilting process, while the second group\nshows the decaying breakdown of the previous ring.\nReynolds number is contrary to the experimental observation of Nerem, Seed &\nWood (1972) who studied the transition to turbulence in the aorta of a dog, in the\nabsence of a stenosis. Significant differences between the two studies occur in the\ngeometric and inflow conditions which could reasonably lead to the alternative trends\nin critical Reynolds number with reduced velocity.\n6.4.2. Nonlinear saturation and transition\nFigure 17 illustrates the flow at various stages of the growth indicated in figure 15.\nThe instantaneous isosurfaces show a negative contour of \u03bb2, the intermediate\neigenvalue of the symmetric tensor S2 + \u21262, with S and \u2126 being, respectively, the\nThree-dimensional instability and transition of stenotic flow 321\nsymmetric and anti-symmetric parts of the velocity gradient tensor \u2207u \u2013 this measure\nwas introduced by Jeong & Hussain (1995) for identification of vortical structures in\nthree-dimensional flows.\nThe two initial panels of figure 17(a) show top and side views of the isosurface at\ntime instant t =40T (see figure 15 for the time base). We find a number of groups of\nstructures (each of which, near to the stenosis, can be thought of as being associated\nwith a vortex ring) that correspond to the evolution of individual velocity pulses. The\nfollowing eight panels show snap-shots at T\/8 phases up to t =41T : taken together,\nthese panels represent the evolution over time interval T of the flow following the\ninitial saturation in figure 15. The relative coherence of the structures shows that\nat this time, the flow is still quite well-organized, and (as evidenced by comparison\nof the top and side views) retains the symmetry of the initial condition. Looking\nat the side views in this sequence, we can observe how, travelling downstream, a\nvortex-ring structure first acquires a small tilt (corresponding to perturbation by the\nFloquet eigenmode), then, presumably through a process of self-induction and wall\ninteraction, is rapidly torn apart until it appears as a packet of lambda-vortices. Note\nthat at t =41T , we see almost exactly a vertical reflection of the structures seen in side\nview at t =40T ; this is a consequence of the fact that the instability arises through a\nperiod-doubling bifurcation.\nThe two panels of figure 17(b) show the flow at t =132T and t =280T , respectively,\nin the midst of and at the end of the slow final growth in energies of the non-\naxisymmetric modes observed in figure 15. We find that this slow transition has come\nabout as the vortex-ring breakdown, seen near the end of the field of view in the initial\npanels, moves progressively further upstream. In the asymptotic state, this breakdown\ntakes place almost immediately after ring formation, and is highly turbulent.\nAt t =280T , the flow still has the symmetry of the initial conditions, as expressed in\n(3.9). Before proceeding with further evolution, the real and imaginary parts of the first\nazimuthal mode were perturbed with Gaussian-distributed noise, at O(10\u22124), which,\nduring further evolution to t =300T , led to the redistribution of energy between the\nreal and imaginary components of the modes, and destruction of symmetry. However,\nthis redistribution scarcely affected the asymptotic distribution of energies between\nthe modes observed near t =280T in figure 15. Also, when the nature of the flow\nis considered at the largest length scales and over a moderate number of cycles, it\ndoes not substantially perturb the period-doubling mechanism, indicating that it is\ncomparatively robust.\nFigure 17(c) shows a perspective view of structures near the stenosis, part-way\nthrough the cycle following t =300T , again visualized using an isosurface of \u03bb2. In\nthe parallel section of the tube downstream of the stenosis, there are two groups of\nstructures. The upstream group shows a single vortex ring in the late stages of its\ntilting deformation; it is evident that this is a complex three-dimensional event. The\nsecond group of structures represents the decaying breakdown of the previous vortex\nring. Note that the streamwise spacing of successive breakdowns is much reduced\ncompared to those seen at earlier times t\/T =41, 132, in figure 17.\nThe process of ring breakdown is highly dissipative, and will lead to high levels\nof wall shear stress, as well as of its temporal and spatial gradients, all of which are\nnow thought to be relevant to development of atheroma and thrombi. It is interesting\nthat, even though the linear stability analysis and the initial nonlinear saturation\ncondition (t \u2248 40T ) shows the breakdown to occur far downstream of the stenosis\nin our idealized geometry, it subsequently progresses upstream to occur only a few\ndiameters downstream of the stenosis. It should also be pointed out, however, that the\n322 S. J. Sherwin and H. M. Blackburn\nhighest wall shear stresses (while perhaps not their highest spatio-temporal gradients)\nwill almost certainly occur in the throat of the stenosis itself.\n6.4.3. Shear-layer instability\nIn experimental investigations of stenotic flow with geometries similar to those\nconsidered in this paper (Cassanova & Giddens 1978; Ahmed & Giddens 1983), the\nbreakdown in the post-stenotic region has been accompanied by finer-scale shear-\nlayer-type instabilities, as was discussed in relation to steady inlet flows in \u00a7 5.4.4.\nIn the saturated nonlinear state with a steady inflow, we have observed shear-layer\ninstabilities as shown in figure 9. During our DNS study of the single-harmonic\npulsatile flow, on the other hand, we did not observe signs of shear-layer instabilities.\nNevertheless, during our resolution studies for computing pulsatile base flows to\nbe used in Floquet analysis, shear-layer oscillations were often noted when the flows\nwere under-resolved. Localized oscillations produced high-frequency signals, readily\nobserved in pressure time series at sampling points remote from the instability site.\nThese instabilities were usually found to be triggered at times when a pulsatile\nvelocity front propagated through a region of low resolution. The oscillations always\ndisappeared when mesh resolution was sufficient \u2013 in fact, oscillations became one of\nour key diagnostics, indicative of poor mesh design or under-resolution.\nThe physical experiments, our experience in computing base flows, and some of\nthe DNS results described here all suggest that in this problem, jet shear layers may\nbe subject to convective instability (Huerre & Monkewitz 1985, 1990). While this\nis not our main theme, and difficulties of analysis (particularly considering that we\nare confronted with pulsatile flows) preclude a rigorous examination, we describe in\nthis section a brief heuristic study of shear-layer oscillations for the axisymmetric\ntwo-harmonic base flow at Ured =5, Re =550. Of all the cases dealt with, this was\nthe most susceptible to oscillation, probably because of its elevated Reynolds number\nand peak-to-mean ratio, the combination of which results in thin shear layers.\nThe investigation was computed at Np =9 on the mesh shown in figure 3(c); at\nthis resolution, and with inlet flows of the form (2.2), oscillations in the flow are not\nobserved. We then added a small high-frequency component to the inlet flow, now\ndescribed by\nu\u00af(t) = 1 + 0.75 sin(2\u03c0 t\/T ) \u2212 0.75 cos(4\u03c0 t\/T ) + Amp sin(nf 2\u03c0 t\/T ), (6.1)\nand where we have taken Amp =0.001, i.e. a maximum perturbation amplitude which\nis 1\/1000 of the mean base flow velocity, and nf is an adjustable integer harmonic.\nFigure 18(a) illustrates the periodic time series of perturbation axial velocity, \nu,\ndownstream of the stenosis (z\/D=1, r\/D=0.25) for different values of the harmonic\nnf . The perturbation velocity, \nu, was evaluated by subtracting the time history of the\nunforced inflow solution (Amp =0) from the forced inflow (Amp =0.001). Figure 18(b)\nshows the amplification of inflow forcing, evaluated by the maximum perturbation\nvelocity, |\nu|max at a fixed point defined as\n|\nu|max(z, r) = max\n0\u0001t < T\n|\nu(z, r, t)|,\nnormalized by the forcing amplitude Amp . Here we observe that the maximum\namplification of the inflow forcing occurs at a frequency corresponding to nf =65,\nwhere we have an amplification of |\nu|max =272Amp .

(The last panel uses a different isocontour scaling to the previous two.)\nvortex ring clearly display a Kelvin\u2013Helmholtz-type instability which also, at this level\nof Amp , appears to disrupt the primary vortex. However, further downstream at z\/D=\n20, where the Floquet mode is at its most energetic, we observe that the shear-layer\noscillations have decayed, leaving a vorticity pattern similar to the unforced case.\nThe oscillations bear the classic hallmarks of convective instability: they are highly\nreceptive in a well-defined frequency band, and do not develop in the absence of\nforcing. In animations, they are clearly seen to grow as they propagate downstream.\nOn the other hand, here at least, the instability exists only over part of the base flow\ncycle, and does not survive into the region where the three-dimensional instabilities\ndevelop. The question of how much influence convective instability might ultimately\nhave on large-scale flow structures produced by the primary absolute instability in\n324 S. J. Sherwin and H. M. Blackburn\nthese flows remains an open one. This point also depends on the size and nature of\nany perturbation. However, we have calculated the Floquet multiplier at a Reynolds\nnumber of Re =550 and a polynomial order of Np =9 for a base flow with inflow\nforcing at a frequency of nf =65 and amplitude Amp =0.001 (as for the base flow\nillustrated in figure 18). For this case, we again obtained period doubling, with\na multiplier of \u00b5=\u22121.180 as opposed to \u00b5=\u22121.174 for the case with no high-\nfrequency forcing.\n6.4.4. Comparison to previous studies\nThe most relevant works for comparison purposes are the flow visualization and\nlaser Doppler measurements of Ahmed & Giddens (1983, 1984) and Ahmed (1998),\nand the flow visualization results of Ojha et al. (1989). Ahmed & Giddens have\nRe =600, Upm \u2248 1.7 and \u03b1=7.5, and the parameters of Ojha et al. are similar, with\nRe =575, Upm \u2248 1.6 and \u03b1=7.5. Both sets of experiments used an approximation\nto a single-harmonic pulsatile waveform. Both works employ (at least in part) a\nconvergent\/divergent axisymmetric stenosis with 75% occlusion, but that of Ojha\net al. is sharp-edged while Ahmed & Giddens\u2019s is smooth. For 75% stenosis,\nhighly unsteady but transient fluctuations were observed downstream of the tube\nconstrictions in both experiments.\nThe lowest Womersley number investigated for the onset of linear instability in the\npresent work is \u03b1=10.2 (Ured =7.5) where Rec =500, and we would expect that the\nlower value of \u03b1=7.5 used by the other workers would result in a higher critical\nReynolds number, probably of order 600 or above. On the other hand, it appears\nquite possible (on the basis of the DNS investigations for the steady flow and for the\nUred =2.5 pulsatile flow) that the bifurcation would be subcritical in all cases, so we\nmight also expect that three-dimensional unsteadiness could be sustained down to\nthe Reynolds numbers found in the above experiments.\nIn Ahmed & Giddens (1984) it is stated that \u2018turbulence was found only for the 75%\nstenosis and was created only during part of the cycle\u2019, whereas in Ahmed (1998) these\nfluctuations, which are strongest for 2.5<z\/D\u0001 6, are characterized as non-turbulent\nowing to the presence in the conditional velocity spectra of a band of dominant\nfrequencies associated with \u2018vortex shedding and a turbulent front\u2019. These findings\nare in quite good agreement with the dye-front flow visualization and interpretation\nprovided by Ojha et al. (1989). For the 75% stenosis, they found four post-stenotic\nzones: Zone I, reaching to z\/D=3, is called the \u2018stable jet region\u2019, although some\nindication of (apparently axisymmetric) wavy structure can be observed on the jet\nfront in this region; Zone II, 3<z\/D\u0001 4.5 is called the \u2018transition region\u2019, where the\nwaves become larger; in Zone III, the \u2018turbulent region\u2019, 4.5<z\/D\u0001 7.5, the front\nrapidly distorts; Zone IV, z\/D > 7.5 is labelled \u2018relaminarization\u2019.\nThese experimental results are thus in reasonable agreement with the kind of\nasymptotic behaviour we have observed in DNS, for Re =400 and \u03b1=15.9, as can\nbe seen in figure 17(b, c): a rapid distortion of a vortex ring becoming evident a\nfew diameters downstream of the stenosis, leading to a highly unsteady\/transitional\nbreakdown at z\/D \u223c 6, following which, relaminarization takes place further\ndownstream.\n7. Conclusions\nWe have studied steady and pulsatile flow in a smooth axisymmetric 75% stenotic\ntube, using a combination of three-dimensional stability analysis and direct numerical\nThree-dimensional instability and transition of stenotic flow 325\nsimulation. Our objective here has been to establish stability characteristics and overall\nflow behaviour, rather than to provide detailed statistics.\nFor steady inflow, we have observed a linear instability at Rec =722, where the\nReynolds number is based upon the sectionally and time-averaged flow, u\u00afm and the\nfull pipe diameter, D. The instability arises in the k=1 azimuthal Fourier mode and\nhas the character of a Coanda-type wall attachment, where the axisymmetric shear\nlayer of the base flow generated in the post-stenotic region is perturbed towards the\npipe wall. The nature of the initial nonlinear saturation observed in DNS Re =750\nindicates that the instability is subcritical and therefore hysteretic in nature. On further\nevolution, the flow becomes turbulent downstream of the stenosis. Taking this state as\nan initial condition and reducing the Reynolds number, we have observed turbulent\nflow down to Re =688, confirming the presence of hysteresis. The asymptotic state\nof the flow at Re =750 contains long-period fluctuations on a time scale of 35D\/u\u00afm.\nThese fluctuations are associated with a slow flapping of the jet, and coupled axial\nmovement of a region of localized turbulent breakdown, the spatial onset of which\noscillates between approximately 4D and 10D from the throat of the stenosis. The cri-\ntical Reynolds numbers observed through this numerical analysis are consistent with\nthe experimental work of Cassanova & Giddens (1978) and Ahmed & Giddens (1983).\nFor pulsatile inflows, we have considered two types of non-reversing pulsatile\nwaveforms which satisfy the Womersley solution for straight tubes. The first waveform\ncontained a mean and single harmonic with a peak to mean ratio of Upm =1.75 and\nwhere we have used three different pulse periods T , as expressed by reduced velocities\nof Ured = u\u00afmT \/D=2.5, 5 and 7.5. A further waveform of a mean and two harmonics\nwas also considered, with a peak-to-mean ratio of Upm =2.5 and at a reduced\nvelocity of Ured =5. Floquet stability analysis was undertaken for these four inlet-flow\nwaveforms. For the single-harmonic inflows with Ured =2.5, 5 and 7.5, Rec =389, 417\nand 500 (giving critical Womersley numbers of 15.6, 11.4 and 10.2), respectively. The\ncritical Reynolds number for the two-harmonic waveform at Ured =5 was found to\nbe Rec =535. Waveforms with a shorter time period (and reduced velocity) are more\nunstable. Somewhat unexpectedly, the two-harmonic waveform, which had a higher\npeak-to-mean ratio, was found to be more stable than the single-harmonic waveform\nat the same reduced velocity. An interesting feature of the two-harmonic flow is\namalgamation of the two vortex rings of different initial strength that are generated\nin one pulse cycle. For all the pulsatile cases considered, instability occurred through\na period-doubling bifurcation, and the nature of the instability was identified as\nalternating tilting of vortex rings generated during sequential pulsatile cyclic ejections\nfrom the stenotic constriction. This behaviour appears to bear some similarity to the\nbifurcations of free jets observed by Glezer (see Saffman 1981) and Reynolds et al.\n(2003), although here constrained by the presence of tube walls.\nDirect numerical simulation was also performed for the single harmonic waveform\nat Ured =2.5 and Re =400. This simulation demonstrated that the instability was\nagain subcritical and that after a linear instability phase which tilts the vortex ring\nejected from the stenosis, it rapidly breaks down into finer-scale components. After a\nrelatively long period (O(200T )) the nonlinear saturated state develops to produce a\nlocalized turbulent breakdown which occurs at approximately 4D downstream of the\nstenosis. Although this characteristic is similar to the final state of the steady flow,\nwe note that the instability and transition mechanisms are very different and occur\nat a lower average Reynolds number in the pulsatile flows.\nWhile computing axisymmetric base flow for the two-harmonic waveform, shear-\nlayer instabilities were observed when the simulations were under-resolved. Motivated\n326 S. J. Sherwin and H. M. Blackburn\nby this observation and evidence of shear-layer oscillations in some of the available\nexperiments, we have also performed a non-exhaustive investigation of shear-layer\ninstability by perturbing the fully resolved axisymmetric base flow on the inflow\nboundary with high-frequency components of amplitude 1\/1000 that of the mean\nflow speed. A maximum amplification of approximately 275 was observed at a fixed\npoint in the shear layer just downstream of the stenosis when the forcing frequency\nwas on the 65th harmonic of the base flow fundamental frequency. However, at\nthis level of perturbation the shear-layer oscillations, while of moderate magnitude,\nremain spatially localized enough to not greatly influence Floquet instability.\nThe motivation for this study derives from interest in the flows of the human\narterial system. For this idealized geometry, the steady and puslatile flow critical\nReynolds numbers predicted here are relatively high for physiological conditions in\nthe systemic or coronary arteries, although the reduced velocities of the pulsatile flows\nare reasonable. However, in an axisymmetric stenosis, the sectional Reynolds number\nincreases as the inverse of the local diameter. We might therefore expect that higher\ndegrees of stenosis (i.e. greater reduction of diameter) would lead to a reduction of the\ncritical Reynolds number. Further, the subcritical nature of the instabilities implies\nthat they are hysteretic and so turbulent flow can persist at lower Reynolds numbers\nthan the critical value as demonstrated by the direct numerical simulations. The final\nsaturated states of the nonlinear breakdown of both the steady and pulsatile flows\nstudies also indicate regions of strong localized turbulence which are associated with\nstrong temporal and spatial shear stress gradients that have been implicated in the\nonset of arterial disease such as atherosclerosis.\nThis work was supported through the Merit Allocation Scheme of the Australian\nPartnership for Advanced Computing.
