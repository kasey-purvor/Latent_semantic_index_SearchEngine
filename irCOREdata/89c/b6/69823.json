Drawing on a nine-month ethnographic study of \nthree residential services, it outlines a range of obstacles to the promotion of choice \nand control that were routinely observed in the culture and working practices of the \nservices. Issues discussed include conflicting service values and agendas, inspection \nregimes, an attention to the bigger decisions in a person\u2019s life when empowerment \ncould more quickly and effectively be promoted at the level of everyday practice, \nproblems of communication and interpretation, and the pervasiveness of teaching. We \noffer a range of suggestions as to how these obstacles might be tackled.\nPromoting choice and control.. \n 2 \n \nPromoting choice and control in residential services for people with learning \ndisabilities \n \n In the UK, recent government policy places the promotion of choice, control and \nempowerment as a central value for social care services (eg Department of Health, \n2005; HM Government, 2005; Prime Minister\u2019s Strategy Unit, 2005; Social Exclusion \nUnit, 2005). In services for people with learning disabilities, for example, policies \nhave been put in place to encourage empowerment through person-centred planning, \ndirect payments and individual budgets, including service-users in Partnership \nBoards, increases in the number of advocates, and making sure information is \npresented in a variety of formats.  \n \nHowever, there are still barriers to the promotion of empowerment in services. The \nrecent report Improving the Life Chances of Disabled People (Prime Minister\u2019s \nStrategy Unit, 2005) discusses two main barriers: supports are often not fitted to the \nindividual, rather disabled people are expected to fit into existing services; and \nservices tend to focus on incapacity, inability and risk, with the result that dependency \nis created. Indeed, this report identifies a \u2018culture of care and dependency\u2019 (p73) in \nhealth and social care services, in which those with \u2018significant cognitive and\/or \ncommunication impairments are particularly at risk of being denied choice and \ncontrol in their lives\u2019 (p78). The difficulties of translating policy goals of choice and \nautonomy into practice for people with learning disabilities have been examined by \nmany writers in the field (eg Beamer & Brookes, 2001; Dowson, 1997; Edge, 2001; \nGuess, Benson & Siegel-Causey, 1985; Harris, 2003; Jenkinson, 1993; Jenkinson et \nal, 1992; Kinsella, 2000; Stalker & Harris, 1998; Thompson, 2003). This paper \ndiscusses obstacles to the promotion of choice and control, drawing on examples from \nan ethnographic study of three residential services, and offers recommendations as to \nhow these might be overcome. \n \nInteraction as central to empowerment and disempowerment \nImproving Services, Improving Lives recognizes that the interactions between \n\u2018disadvantaged people and frontline staff are crucial to how successful services are in \nmeeting people\u2019s needs\u2019 (Social Exclusion Unit, 2005, p57). This is particularly the \nPromoting choice and control.. \n 3 \ncase for those with multiple, complex support needs, who reports have identified as \nbenefiting least from current policy initiatives (HM Government, 2005; Learning \nDisability Task Force, 2004). Empowerment is not just about choosing to take this \ntype of support rather than that, or providing input into the evaluation and practices of \na service in structured situations, but is about what happens between people moment-\nby-moment, in the mundane details of everyday interaction. Power permeates \neveryday life; it is exercised in the way people talk to each other, in what utterances \nare taken up and what are ignored, in how and what options are offered, in how \ninformation is presented, how spaces are opened up for people to express preferences \nand how spaces are shut down (Jenkinson, 1993). This is recognized in recent models \nof supported decision-making, which point out that for many people with learning \ndisabilities, dynamic models of choice which acknowledge the role of sensitive \nsupporters are the most appropriate (eg Beamer & Brooks, 2001; Edge, 2001; Harris, \n2003).  \n \nUnfortunately, the ways people have of talking, and the concerns they orient to when \nthey talk to people with learning disabilities, often act counter to the values of choice \nand control. This is even found in situations in which supporters are attempting to \npromote empowerment. Our research to date illustrates how power is a dominant \nfeature of interactions between people with learning disabilities and those employed \nto support them, to such an extent that even in forums set up to provide opportunities \nfor service-users to speak out, subtle interactional dynamics may act to disempower \nthem (e.g., Antaki, Finlay, Sheridan, Jingree & Walton, 2006; Jingree, Finlay & \nAntaki, 2006; Antaki, Young & Finlay, 2002).  \n \nThis is acknowledged in official reports: Improving Services, Improving Lives states \nthat disabled people can feel \u2018steered towards choices made by other people\u2019 (Social \nExclusion Unit, 2005, p64), in particular, that sometimes staff, managers and parents \ntry to control the lives of people with learning disabilities (Learning Disability \nTaskforce, 2004). Among other reasons, this is because of imbalances in the skills, \nknowledge and resources available to the various parties, but also because much \ninformation brought to bear on discussions and decisions is mediated by supporters \n(eg which options are presented as possible, how different outcomes are framed, how \npractical issues might or might not be overcome).  \nPromoting choice and control.. \n 4 \n \nWe have just completed an intensive, nine-month study of three residential units for \npeople with learning disabilities in which we conducted extended observations, and \nvideo-recorded everyday practice. What we find in all of these settings is that what \ncounts as choice and control, when translated into behaviour in real situations, is a \ncomplex issue, and staff regularly face difficult dilemmas when attempting to promote \nthese goals. The abstract level of official discourse is not always, or easily, translated \ninto the concrete level of questioning, encouraging, commanding, chiding or coercing \n(among other ways that staff engage with residents). Empowerment does not flow in \nany straightforward way from changes in service values, structures, planning or \ninspection regimes. Certainly there are examples of when staff do promote \nempowerment, but attention to the details of interaction show us also many ways, \noften barely even noticed by the actors, in which disempowerment occurs. In some \nservices the obstacles are so widespread as to provide a pervasive climate which \nfrustrates the choice and control agenda. We have grouped these under four main \nheadings: conflicting agendas and inspection regimes; attending to the small things; \ncommunication difficulties; and the pervasiveness of teaching.  \n \n1) Conflicting Agendas and Inspection Regimes \nLipsky (1980, described in Hudson, 1993), writing on the dilemmas faced by those at \n\u2018street-level\u2019 who deliver public services, notes that such workers often have to \nexercise discretion over how to allocate resources and which service objectives should \ntake priority where they are seen to be conflicting. The decisions and routines of \nworkers, says Lipsky, effectively \u2018become the public policies they carry out\u2019 (1993, p. \n382). In services for people with learning disabilities, while choice and control are \nnow put centre stage in government discourse, there are other values and concerns to \nwhich staff also orient in their work (Beamer & Brooks, 2001; Jenkinson et al, 1992). \nThe values promoted through inspection regimes, Care Plans, Health Care and Risk \nAssessments are often, in practice, contrary to those promoted by the choice agenda. \nAs Beamer and Brooks put it: \u201cServices are important in the lives of many people \nwith high support needs and yet how they are structured and provided is often also \npart of the problem\u201d (p77; see also Cocks & Cockram, 1997; Dowson, 1997; Kinsella, \n2000; Swift, 2005). While some of these obstacles are the result of informal routines \nand cultures of working in particular sites (Harris, 2003; Rawlings, Dowse & \nPromoting choice and control.. \n 5 \nShaddock, 1995), others are due to regulatory frameworks, local organisational \npolicy, resources and the existing structure of services (Bannerman et al, 1990; \nDowson, 1997; Stancliffe et al, 2000). In both cases, staff are held accountable; in the \nfirst case to fellow workers, in the second to management. \n \nThis conflict is recognized in the recent Green Paper on social care, Independence, \nWell-Being and Choice, which acknowledges the need for a debate about managing \nissues of choice against the protection of vulnerable adults such that choice is not \ninvariably sacrificed to the goal of protecting individuals from risk (DH, 2005; see \nBeamer & Brooks, 2001 and Guess et al, 1985 for discussions of this issue). But risk \nis not the only agenda that might conflict with goals of choice and empowerment, and \nthe Green Paper recognizes that staff can be under pressure from several different \ndirections.  \n \nConflicting values are linked to the different roles staff manage. For example, in one \nservice for people with multiple and profound impairments in our study, being a \ncompetent team-member seemed to involve making sure the residents had all eaten \nand gone to the toilet before the next shift came on, and making sure the house was \nclean and the laundry done. These priorities are not difficult to understand if we \nrecognize that an unannounced visit by a relative or manager is more likely to lead to \na complaint about lack of cleanliness than to a challenge over whether residents\u2019 \npreferences had been respected earlier in the day. The former is immediately visible; \nthe latter is not. In this service, cleanliness and routine seemed to be the primary \nconcerns for the staff, even taking precedence over engaging with the residents in \neither a social or task-based manner (see Puddicombe, 1995, for a discussion of this \nissue). In this home, most staff members would also not routinely encourage residents \nto participate in the preparation of their meals; in part because of fears over food \n\u2018hygiene\u2019 and in part because they saw the residents as lacking the skills required.   \n \nThere are other role conflicts, of course. Being a good keyworker may involve liasing \nwith family members, who have their own views which might run contrary to the \npreference of the person with learning disabilities. Being a good employee may \ninvolve making sure an agenda is pursued in a meeting in a reasonable amount of \ntime, making sure other residents are not disturbed, making sure a person adheres to \nPromoting choice and control.. \n 6 \nhealth or dietary plans, making sure the rules (or routines) of the house are upheld, the \nhealth and safety procedures not violated, and so on. Staff are also representatives of \ntheir profession or employing organisation, and, in line with this, we have observed \nstaff deflecting criticism of other workers or service structures by offering residents \nrationalizations or by simply ignoring such complaints (eg Antaki et al, 2002). For \nexample, in one assessment unit we observed a man repeatedly complain about the \nlength of time his care manager was taking to arrange a new residential placement, \nand the difficulty he faced when trying to contact the person, who rarely returned his \ncalls. This was a real source of frustration since the man was not only effectively \nexcluded from the process of searching for a new home, but he had no idea of the time \nhe would have to wait in the assessment unit. Though members of staff did \nsympathize with the man\u2019s frustration and did challenge the care manager, over time \nthey gradually began to \u2018screen out\u2019 the resident\u2019s complaints, thereby adding to his \nfrustration and anger. Since the man had been referred to the assessment unit for \nproblems with anger and violent outbursts, this was not only profoundly \ndisempowering, but clinically counter-productive. \n \nIn health services, discourses of \u2018clinical needs\u2019 often take precedence over a person\u2019s \nimmediate desires (eg van Hooren, Widdershoven, van den Borne & Curfs, 2002), \nand it takes some semantic juggling to bring this into line with recent Department of \nHealth guidance on implementing person-centred planning which suggests that choice \nshould be the primary goal, or that the two agendas should be combined, as in the \nintegration of Person-Centred Planning with Care Programme Approach assessments \nfor those with challenging behaviour and mental health needs (Routledge & \nSanderson, 2001) . This is difficult to achieve given the grey area where treatment and \nassessment currently reside in services for people with learning disabilities, in which \nbehavioural regimes, drug treatment and intellectual assessments are administered \nwith a little real consideration paid to issues of informed consent (see Edge, 2001, for \na discussion of the legality of carrying out medical procedures without consent). \nServices charged with protecting and acting in the best interests of people with \nlearning disabilities, by their very nature, rely upon the institutional capacity to over-\nrule and act contrary to the wishes of the individual. Examples we observed included \nthe promotion of continence in Care Plans, which in one service resulted in staff \nphysically compelling residents to visit the toilet even when they protested, and more-\nPromoting choice and control.. \n 7 \nor-less formal \u2018locked door\u2019 policies, which for the protection of service users limit \ntheir access to the world outside the units despite there being no legal basis for this. \n \nWe have also observed a range of preventive practices which were routinely carried \nout because staff believed they were necessary for good quality care, but which often \nwere not. For example, in one unit residents were weighed monthly. Although some \nclearly did not want to be weighed, and made their resistance (and sometimes distress) \nclear, staff were observed to repeatedly encourage them onto the scales (Finlay, \nAntaki & Walton, in press). When we discussed this with the staff team later, it \nappeared that none of them felt it was necessary for the health of the residents, but \nthey did it \u2018because there\u2019s a chart\u2019. Although no one knew who had originally \ndevised the chart, they believed the Commision for Social Care Inspection (CSCI \u2013 \nthe organisation responsible for inspection of Social Care homes in the UK) \ninspections checked it, therefore it had to be filled in.  \n \nInspection regimes are an important factor in the way in which services carry out their \nbusiness. As Cocks and Cockram (1997) point out in their discussion of \ncontradictions in legislation, health and safety rules with a protective focus \u2018may turn \nhomes for people with learning disabilities into work places\u2019 (p237; see also Dowson, \n1997). In one example from our research, a recent CSCI report on one residential \nhome required that cleaning materials be stored in a locked cupboard, and noted that \nfoods were put in the fridge without their contents and opening dates being properly \nlabelled. Although residents were often responsible for doing their own laundry and \npreparing food, this meant they must now seek staff assistance to gain access to the \nwashing powder and to properly label food before putting it in the fridge. In the same \nhouse there were five differently-coloured chopping boards, each one for a different \ntype of food, and residents had to be supervised to ensure they choose the correct \nboard. Clearly these requirements put obstacles in the way of the residents\u2019 \nindependence which none of us face in our own homes. By complying with relevant \nregulations and procedures, the staff are compelled to follow procedures and practices \nthat actively disempower the users of that service (for another example see Stancliffe \net al, 2000).  \n \nPromoting choice and control.. \n 8 \nThe problem with inspections from CSCI is that they encourage defensive practices \nby staff in the knowledge that the safety of the buildings, the health of the residents, \nthe proper completion of \u2018paper trails\u2019, plans and charts are going to be checked. \nAssessing how much the residents are disempowered is a far more difficult business, \nand is approached only partially by checking whether people have \u2018person-centred \nplans\u2019 and by collecting verbal evidence from residents, families and staff. In many \nplaces, where residents are not able to report verbally and where families may be less \nconcerned with choice than health and hygiene, CSCI inspections simply cannot \nassess this aspect of the quality of a service. The level of choice and control people in \nthese services have can only be assessed by observing what goes on over a period of \ntime in the mundane details of a person\u2019s life: can they choose to eat later?; can they \ndecide to go to bed when they want?; can they help themselves to more tea?; do staff \nrespond to them when they approach them for social interaction? Asking the staff \nwhether this is generally the case, in our experience, does not necessarily provide \nreliable evidence. \n \nTo take this argument one step further, we have studied service-user meetings in a \nvariety of residential and day services and found that when facilitated by a staff \nmember these can be just as disempowering as other aspects of a person\u2019s life (Antaki \net al, 2006; Jingree et al, 2006). Not only have we seen staff directing who can speak \nand when, what topics are appropriate for discussion, and which complaints and \nsuggestions get taken seriously, but we have also seen how meetings can make \ndecision-making far more difficult for some people who find it difficult to concentrate \nand respond in such settings. The irony is that the existence and minutes of such \nmeetings are often produced as evidence by a service that it is listening to the voices \nof the service-users, and promoting self-advocacy. Other ways of promoting choice \nand control, which might be far more suitable for some people, such as talking to \nthem over a period of days in a quiet place, do not produce such hard evidence of \ngood practice, yet may be considerably more effective in achieving policy goals for \nsome people. \n \n2) Attending to the small things \nWhen discussing choice and control, there is a danger of focusing on the bigger \nchoices in a person\u2019s life: choosing a holiday, choosing where and with whom one \nPromoting choice and control.. \n 9 \nlives; choosing activities or clubs outside the home, and so on. We might then neglect \nthe much more frequent, everyday areas in which a person can experience \nempowerment and disempowerment. Although this is particularly important for \npeople with multiple and severe impairments, it applies to all people with learning \ndisabilities.  \n \nLet us consider one man who participated in our study. He did not communicate \nverbally, required assistance to walk, and had effective use of only one hand. For \nmost of the day he would sit in a chair or a sofa in the group home in which he lived, \nwatching what occurred around him. There appeared to be very little in his life over \nwhich he exercised control, except to cooperate or resist getting up when staff \nencouraged him, to offer his hand so that someone might hold it, or to choose what to \nlook at in his immediate environment. Because he had extremely limited \ncommunication and needed assistance for almost every task of daily living, the staff \ndid not think that there was much they could do to increase the level of control he had \nover his life. However, it was apparent from observation that the day was full of \nopportunities for him to exercise control, but they were so small and banal they were \nnot seen by the staff as choice situations \u2013 they were seen instead as care situations. \nFor example, we filmed one episode where he was sitting at a table with a small jug of \ncoffee in front of him. He would pour a bit into his cup, drink, pour a bit more in, and \nso on. Although all staff knew he could do this himself, they did not routinely give \nhim a jug; instead they would give him a full cup of coffee, and when he was finished \nthey would take his cup from him. By simply providing him with a jug, and allowing \nhim to take his own time, the amount of control he was able to exercise over drinking \nhis coffee increased greatly. He could decide how full his cup was, when to refill, how \nmany cups to drink. This type of control is crucial to a person with severe and \nmultiple impairments, and if we pay attention to these types of details we have the \nopportunity of increasing people\u2019s levels of choice and control greatly without any \nextra resources.  \n \nIn the same house, staff would routinely dish the food onto residents\u2019 plates at meat-\ntimes. One day they tried putting the food in serving bowls in the middle of the tables \nand allowing the residents to serve themselves. Suddenly the residents could decide \nthe quantity of food they wanted, when they wanted to put it on their plates, what \nPromoting choice and control.. \n 10 \nparts of a meal they did not want on their plates, and whether to have second-\nhelpings. Again, a simple change in practice allowed the residents to exercise a great \ndeal more control over their lives. The reason staff gave for not doing it before was \nthat the residents were not used to doing it; they feared people would take too much \nfor themselves, would not know when to stop, or would break crockery. Rather than \nseeing this as an opportunity for empowerment, they saw it in terms of a perceived \nlack of competence. The staff needed to be reassured by the management and their \ncolleagues that the benefits in terms of choice and independence were greater than the \nproblems of a more uncontrolled dinner-time. Empowerment can be a messy business \n\u2013 we cannot fixate on goals of efficiency, \u2018good\u2019 sense, and tidiness if we really want \nto extend people\u2019s opportunities to exert themselves on the world.  \n \nWe have given only two examples, but a day is filled with areas in which, with a \nsmall change in practice, a great deal of control can be given back to a person with \nsevere learning disabilities without it actually costing anything. It just requires staff to \nrecognize the opportunities when they arise. \n \n3) Communication difficulties \nIt is acknowledged that in general we do not know enough about people with high \nsupport needs and how to offer them services which provide opportunities for choice \nand control (Learning Disabilities Taskforce, 2004). Staff face practical problems in \noffering or understanding preferences when people have limited language or \ncomprehension (Edge, 2001; Grove, Bunning, Porter & Olsson, 1999; Harris, 2003; \nJenkinson, 1993; Puddicombe, 1995). For example, when understanding is uncertain \nand verbal communication limited, staff have to decide whether that person is really \nexercising a choice, is simply choosing what they know, or is responding to some \nfeature of the options or context irrelevant to the choice being offered. When people \nhave severe communication difficulties, there may be disagreement among supporters \nregarding how to interpret behaviours such as facial expressions, body movements, \nposture and vocalisations (Edge, 2001; Grove, Bunning, Porter & Olsson, 1999).  \nIn contrast, policy guidance tends to present the expression of preference as \nunproblematic; the difficulties are thought to lie after the expression of preference \u2013 in \nthe translation of preference into action. It is vital for policy to acknowledge that the \npromotion of choice and control is often characterized by uncertainty and \nPromoting choice and control.. \n 11 \ncommunicative obstacles (Beamer & Brooks, 2001; Edge, 2001; Puddicombe, 1995; \nsee also Grove et al, 1999, 2000).   \n \nSuggestions for overcoming these sorts of problems do appear in the literature in the \nform of carefully controlled behavioural experiments in which people learn to use \nsymbols, objects or microswitches to express preferences (eg Cooper & Browder, \n1998; Guess et al, 1985; Lancioni et al, 1998; Nozaki & Mochizuki, 1995), or in \nrecommendations to supporters to gather evidence to support interpretations (Edge, \n2001; Grove et al, 2000; Puddicombe, 1995), and to treat behaviours as having \nmeaning using developmental models (eg Grove et al, 1999). However, these \nstrategies require either a degree of specialist knowledge or a culture of consistency, \ndebate and evaluation which may be lacking in many services for people with severe \ncommunication difficulties. Such procedures were notably absent from some of the \nsettings involved in our research.  \n \nWe observed many situations in which staff found it difficult to ascertain what the \nperson wanted. In a good number of cases, it appeared that aspects of the staff\u2019s \nbehaviour created added confusion. For example, we observed one staff member open \na multi-pack of crisps, remove two differently-flavoured packets and hold them out to \na person, asking \u2018Which one do you want?\u2019. The person being asked to decide could \nnot read and did not speak, and, after a long pause, eventually took the packet that \nwas held nearest to her. Given that the researchers did not recognize the flavours from \nthe colours on the pack (one was \u2018lamb and mint\u2019), it seemed likely that the woman \nchoosing also did not. For this to really work as choice, more thought would have \nbeen required: for example by opening the packets so the person could sample each \ntype, or, as a longer term strategy, teaching the person what each coloured packet \ntasted like. But at a glance it seemed as if a real choice had been offered. \n \nIn another home, in which the residents were more verbally able, staff went to great \nlengths to elicit preferences from those they supported. They suspected that a number \nof residents would habitually choose the last option offered them, and others would \nagree to suggestions without really understanding or attending to the content of the \nsuggestion. As a result, the staff spent a lot of time checking people\u2019s answers: they \nwould often rephrase questions several times before answers were finally accepted. \nPromoting choice and control.. \n 12 \nAlthough this appeared to be an effective strategy for some residents, it led others to \nchange their answers several times, suggesting that they took the follow-up questions \nas meaning their original answer was unsatisfactory. \n \nA further pervasive practice in several homes was the reliance (and sometimes \ninsistence) on verbal communication, much of which appeared too complex for the \nresidents (for examples of this in other services see Bradshaw, 2001; Markova, 1991; \nMcConkey, Morris & Purcell, 1999; McConkey, Purcell & Morris, 1999; Purcell, \nMcConkey & Morris, 2000). In one home in which the residents rarely communicated \nverbally, staff nevertheless used speech as their primary mode of interacting with \nthem, often asking them questions and giving them options to which there was no \nevidence they could respond. Although this seemed a respectful way of offering \nsupport (after all, no one was sure quite how much the residents did understand), it \nwould have been interesting to see how much easier life would have become for the \nresidents if staff had had to think of non-verbal ways of interacting. Becoming used to \ndeveloping interactions without speech (for example using Intensive Interaction \u2013 \nNind & Hewitt, 2001 \u2013 or training staff in more sensitive communication \u2013 Dobson, \nUpadhyaya & Stanley, 2002; Purcell et al, 2000) is a profoundly empowering way of \nworking. In another home, staff would often miss relevant contributions that were \nmade non-verbally because they were more \u2018tuned-in\u2019 to noticing verbal utterances, \nand would often ask resident questions verbally (for example about food) when it \nwould have been just as easy (and much less confusing) to ascertain their preferences \nwithout speaking at all. All of these practices, we would argue, are disempowering \nsince they put additional obstacles in the way of people with learning disabilities in \ntheir attempts to exert control over their environments.  \n  \n4) The pervasiveness of teaching \nThere is a tension in service agendas which needs to be articulated \u2013 on the one hand \nservices are to be person-centred (ie support designed around the preferences and \nneeds of the individual) with the individual exercising choice and control, and on the \nother services are increasingly being encouraged to help develop the \u2018capacity\u2019 in \ntheir users to exercise control (e.g., SEU, 2005). Of course, services for people with \nlearning disabilities have for many years been aiming to increase the independence \nand skills of those they support. The problem is that while both goals are laudable, in \nPromoting choice and control.. \n 13 \npractice they often conflict: \u201cthe emphasis on instructional goals and objectives \nidentified by staff is likely to be at the expense of client-initiated behaviours, \nincluding expression of choice and preferences\u201d (Jenkinson, 1993, p370-1 ; see also \nBannerman, Sheldon, Sherman & Harchik, 1990). There is a particular danger that \npeople with learning disabilities will always be seen as individuals who fall short on \n\u2018capacity\u2019 and therefore will always be put in the position of needing further training \nin some aspect of their lives. Supporters take on the role of teachers, and carrying out \nthe daily tasks of living become teaching sessions.  \n \nPositioning a person with learning disabilities as someone to be instructed involves \nnot only teaching practical skills, but also engaging in discussions about values and \nrisks with the goal of \u2018developing\u2019 the person\u2019s understanding of the situation. The \nimplicit goal may often be to bring the views or goals of a person into line with those \nfavoured by their supporters, but through a dialogue about consequences rather than \nthe supporter imposing a set of rules (e.g., van Hooren et al, 2002). Although this is \nan extremely difficult area, the potential for the supporter to exert their influence in \nsubtle ways and make it appear as if the person with learning disabilities has made the \nchoice themselves is enormous and must be acknowledged. In our research, \ninstructional talk was a dominant feature of  interactions between staff and residents \nwhen the latter had a reasonable degree of verbal ability (see Purcell et al, 2000 for a \ndiscussion of this issue), with supporters both testing the person\u2019s knowledge (eg \nplans; safety procedures; facts) as well as exerting influence through discussing \nobstacles and positive and negative outcomes of certain courses of action (eg Antaki \net al, 2006, 2002; Jingree et al, 2006; Rapley, 2004) \n \nHowever, conceiving of a person with learning disabilities as having a fixed identity \ncan also be disempowering. In one of the units in our study, staff argued against \nchanging their own practice on the basis that the residents\u2019 abilities were static. This \nincluded the (in)ability to do things for themselves and the (in)ability to exercise and \nunderstand choice. In one sense, this is a respectful way of operating, and conforms to \nBeamer and Brooks\u2019 (2001) suggestion \u2018that all people should be valued for who they \nare now, rather than what they might achieve, and support should be offered on that \nbasis.\u201d (p33). However, since support was then offered around these identities, and \nevents arranged on a static conception of the residents\u2019 preferences, the result was that \nPromoting choice and control.. \n 14 \nmany opportunities in which residents could exercise choice or control were missed \nbecause routines and patterns of interaction were so well-established (for discussions \nof this issue see Edge, 2001, Puddicombe, 1995). \n \nRecommendations \nThere has already been good work done in the literature on supported decision-\nmaking and person-centred approaches concerning how people can have their \npreferences registered and acted upon, and we will not reiterate these in detail here. \nBriefly, they include: having a range of people from outside the service engaged in \nsupporting decision making (eg Beamer & Brookes, 2001; Thompson, 2003); the \nimportance of long-term knowledge concerning a person\u2019s subtle behaviours and how \nthey reacted to the options on previous occasions (Beamer and Brooks, 2001; Edge, \n2001; Puddicombe, 1995; Routledge & Sanderson, 2001); the importance of \ncollecting observations from a range of settings and supporters in order to ascertain \nthe preferences of people with limited communicative abilities (eg Beamer & Brooks, \n2001; Edge, 2001; Grove et al, 1999, 2000; Sanderson, 1998); and of course the self-\nadvocacy movement (eg Aspis, 1997; Goodley, 2000).  \n \nWe will restrict our recommendations to some things that can done to change \ndisempowering cultures within individual services. While many organisations have \ndecent programmes in which they take service-workers out of their place of work in \norder to provide them with training in person-centred approaches, we suggest that \nmore immediate effects might be achieved by putting an independent observer into \nresidential services, and allowing them to observe everyday life over a period of days \n(e.g. Dobson et al, 2002; Purcell et al, 2000). Because so much of what disempowers \npeople with learning disabilities happens in the small, routine details of life, it can be \nhard for workers who have been immersed in the culture of a service to see it until it \nis pointed out to them. Since interactional practices are also central to empowerment \nand disempowerment, the use of video recording (with the appropriate attention to \nconfidentiality and consent) can be invaluable in pointing out how ways of speaking \ncan place obstacles in the way of a person\u2019s attempts to exert control over their lives. \nOf course, negotiation with staff over the role of the observer and the process is \ncrucial for it to work effectively. \n \nPromoting choice and control.. \n 15 \nIn many cases, disempowering practices are rationalized with reference to the other \nagendas to which staff believe they have to orient (eg health and safety, provision of \nhard evidence for management\/inspection); that is, disempowering practices can be \ndefensive reactions to other service standards and agendas. In many cases, however, \nthe \u2018good reasons\u2019 staff think they have for doing things in certain ways, or the rules \nthey think are in operation, might actually be incorrect \u2013 but only when the practices \nare identified and discussed openly with senior staff can the process of \u2018myth-busting\u2019 \ntake place. The same is true for rationalizations which prevent people from \nparticipation because their skills are deficient \u2013 it needs to be stressed (to both staff \nand families) that untidiness and a little bit of chaos are the natural results of services \nwhich promote empowerment and participation. Again, this type of process is best \ndone inside the individual service working with the whole team around what actually \nhappens from day-to-day, rather than taking individuals out of the service for training. \nIn services which are chronically, profoundly disempowering, and there are still more \nof these around than there should be, often with long-established staff, strong (but not \nhostile) management is crucial to ensure that changes to routine practice are \nmaintained.  \n \nThis type of intervention encourages people to look at the small things in a person\u2019s \nlife, moving services away from seeing choice and control as located primarily in the \nbigger decisions. This is an important issue for those responsible for inspecting \nresidential services. Much of what we saw was oriented towards judgements that \nothers might make of the home: was it clean? were food hygiene procedures in place? \nwas there evidence that meetings had been held to ascertain residents\u2019 views? etc. \nCSCI inspections, while extremely important in maintaining standards, are currently \npoor at assessing whether choice and control are being promoted, and they should \nacknowledge that the ways services adjust to the inspections and reports might \nactually act against empowerment. The truth is that in many services we can only \nreally judge whether residents have choice and control over their lives by spending a \nfew days observing what happens. The answers are not in the filing system or the \nphysical properties of the house, and the desire of services to provide evidence that \nchoices have been offered might sometimes lead to situations which are not optimal \nfor some residents\u2019 participation (eg service-user meetings).  \n \nPromoting choice and control.. \n 16 \nOur final recommendation concerns the reliance on the vocal register that we see in \nresidential services. For people with limited communicative abilities, or who prefer \nnot to speak because their production of sound is indistinct, the natural inclination of \nstaff to do their business verbally, and to celebrate and notice verbal utterances more \nthan non-verbal utterances on the part of residents, can be extremely disempowering. \nThis problem requires a more profound change to services but we believe it is \nnecessary. This issue has already been flagged in a number of studies of staff \ncommunication (eg Bradshaw, 2001; Markova, 1991; McConkey, Morris & Purcell, \n1999; McConkey, Purcell & Morris, 1999) and is admirably addressed by those \nadvocating Intensive Interaction (eg Nind & Hewitt, 2001), \u2018supported decision \nmaking\u2019 (eg Beamer & Brooks, 2001), staff training in communication (e.g. Dobson \net al, 2002; Purcell et al, 2000), and Goode\u2019s (1994) work with deaf-blind children. \nHowever, the translation of these understandings into standard practice seems a long \nway off. \n \nConclusions \nWe need to recognize the difficulties poorly paid and often poorly trained staff face \nwhen we present choice and control as if they were straightforward goals. For the \npeople in the units participating in our research, they were usually not. They often \nconflict with the many other values and goals of the services, and conflict with the \nways in which staff \u2018do\u2019 being competent workers. Promoting empowerment is about \nchanging what it means to be a good worker, changing what it means to have a well-\nrun day-service or home, and having the skills and strategies available to workers in \norder to realistically offer choice in situations where understandings and \ncommunication are at issue. \n \nWe should not underestimate the challenge. Disempowering discourses of care have \nbeen with us for a long time, and are bound up with layer upon layer of practice, \npolicy, patterns of relationships, ways of speaking. Disempowerment is woven into \nthe fabric of social care. The problem is that staff usually have the advantage when \nthey interact with people with learning disabilities: the extra bit of knowledge, the \nprivileged access to the organisation and its priorities, the suspicions about other \nviews which might be brought to bear on the issue, the vocabulary and verbal fluency, \nand as a result it is hard not to dominate. It requires reining in their instinctive ways of \nPromoting choice and control.. \n 17 \ninteracting. Pointing out these problems is not to say there are not good and creative \nthings being done in services. There certainly are. There are also bad things \nhappening which are simply bad practice. But we need to recognize the gulf between \nthe general goals of choice and empowerment at the policy level and the translation of \nthis on the ground. Staff who support the choice agenda continually face practical, \nsocial and philosophical dilemmas and obstacles which they are not sure how to \nmanage, and that this is not recognized at upper management and government levels \ncan be a source or frustration and disillusionment. It is not enough to say services \nshould be based around what service-users want. Staff know there is more at stake \nand that they are answerable to other agendas which often conflict with the choice \nagenda.  \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe research for this article was funded by ESRC grant number RES-148-25-0002. \nThanks to the NHS trust in which the research took place, and the staff and residents \ninvolved \n \n \nReferences \nAntaki, C., Finlay, W.M.L., Sheridan, E., Jingree, T. & Walton, C.
