Our regressions control for fixed-effects in prior \nachievement and residential postcode to compare pupils who are close residential neighbours and \nhave identical observable ability. We also use information on future school choices to control for \npreferences for Faith schooling. Results show that pupils progress faster in Faith primary schools, \nbut all of this advantage is explained by sorting into Faith schools according to pre-existing \ncharacteristics and preferences.  \n \n \n \n 1\n1. Introduction \nQuality of childhood schooling is increasingly seen as important for life chances, because adults\u2019 \nsuccess in the labour market is closely linked to early educational attainments (Carneiro et al., 2007, \nCunha et al., 2006, Cunha and Heckman, 2008 and Heckman, 2000). However, economic and \neducational research has had little success in identifying resource-based interventions that are \neffective in raising school standards (Hanushek, 2003 and 2006). Government policy in many \ncountries now favours reforms based on incentives, governance, increased choice and competition1. \nIn England, this idea has become linked with the expansion of the state-funded Faith-school sector \nbecause it symbolises choice and diversity in the education system and embodies the kind of practice \nin governance that policy makers wish to promote, and \u2013 crucially \u2013 because it is claimed that Faith \nschools offer higher educational standards (DfES White Paper, 2005; DfES Education Bill, 2006). \nThis case is, however, a difficult one to assess, because pupils that choose and get chosen by Faith \nschools differ from the population of pupils in ways that are correlated with their educational \nachievement.  \nMost of the existing research into the effectiveness of Faith schools is based on US Catholic \nschools, which are all private. Therefore previous studies do not distinguish the specific effects of \nreligious affiliation on academic achievement from the effects of a private education. In contrast, \nmost Faith schools in England are state funded and part of the mainstream state system. This makes \nEngland a more attractive setting for studying the specific effects of religious affiliation. In addition, \nit makes this country an interesting framework for assessing the effectiveness of polices aimed at \nimproving state-funded education through the expansion of choice and alternative institutional \narrangements. However, there is almost no evidence for England that makes any attempts to separate \n                                                 \n1\n See LeGrand (1991), Le Grand and Bartlett (1993), and Machin and Vignoles (2005) for a review of the English \nexperience, and Hoxby (2004) for an analysis of US based evidence. \n 2\nout the causal effect of attending a Faith school on educational achievement from pure sorting and \nselection.  \nIn this paper we present new evidence on this issue and tackle estimation of the impact of \nreligious education under conditions in which the process of selection into Faith schools is uncertain \nand complex. We provide insights into whether the performance gap between Faith and Secular \nschools is driven by better schooling in the Faith sector, or by the fact that Faith schools admit \n\u2018better\u2019 pupils to start with. The ultimate aim of the empirical work is to compare standard national \ntest scores at age-11 for students who attended Faith primary schools with near-identical students in \nthe Secular (non-Faith) primary sector. To do so, we use data from an administrative census of \nprimary school pupils in England which contains longitudinal detail on their tests at various ages, \nhistory of schools attended, and places of residence. \nPrevious (mainly US) research has made use of instruments for Faith school attendance such as \nfamily religion, neighbours\u2019 religion and other characteristics of place of residence. However, we \nagree with claims that these instruments are not credible when the point of the exercise is to purge \nestimates of family background and ability-related effects (Altonji et al. 2005a, 2005b). We argue \nthat these instruments are generally inappropriate, because family religion is correlated with other \nbackground characteristics, and because families choose where to live for reasons often related to the \nschool they wish their children to attend. In our context there are no credible instruments for Faith \nschool attendance and it is difficult to draw firm conclusions about a unique parameter capturing the \naverage causal effect of religious schooling. Instead, we use a variety of empirical strategies to bound \nthe magnitude of the causal effect of attending a Faith primary school on educational attainment at \nthe end of primary schooling (age 11). These strategies are based on our knowledge of the \ninstitutional and admissions arrangements in English schools.  \nTo assist in reading the paper, we present next a brief \u2018road map\u2019 of the methods and results, \nwhich proceed in the following sequential fashion: \n 3\n(a) We first exploit the sheer size and high level of detail in our dataset to control for prior, age-\n7 achievement and family background using prior subject-by-achievement-level fixed-effects \nand home-postcode fixed-effects (plus other control variables). \n(b) We next take advantage of the fact that selection into Faith schooling occurs twice, once at \nthe primary phase and again at the secondary phase. We therefore go on to include secondary-\ntype-by-postcode fixed-effects (where \u2018type\u2019 is Faith or Secular schooling) or secondary-school-\nby-postcode fixed-effects in our regressions. This will be an effective strategy if there is \ncomparable selection into both primary and secondary Faith schooling based solely on \nadvantageous pupil and family background characteristics. By this method, we mitigate as much \nas possible the influence of confounding unobservables on pupil attainment at age 11. When we \nfollow this route, we find only a small advantage from Faith primary schooling, worth about 1 \npercentile on age-11 test scores. \n(c) However, controlling for secondary-school or secondary-school-type fixed-effects is \nproblematic if there is selection into Faith secondary schooling according to Faith primary \nattendance, or on the academic outputs of primary schooling, in conjunction with selection on \nunobserved pupil and family background characteristics. Therefore, we go on to present a \nbounding exercise in which we estimate the Faith-primary school effect in two pupil sub-groups, \nnamely: (i) the stayers, who attend the same school type in both the primary and secondary \nphases; and (ii) the switchers, who attend different school types in each of these phases. For the \nstayers, we compare the primary school achievements of pupils who attend both a Faith primary \nand Faith secondary with the primary school achievements of those who attend a Secular school \nin both phases. In the switchers\u2019 case, we compare the primary school achievements of students \nwho attend a Faith primary school but a Secular secondary, with the primary school \nachievements of pupils who attend a Secular primary and Faith secondary school. Under the \nassumption that there is positive selection into Faith-secondary schools based on pupil and \nfamily background, there will be more positive sorting into Faith-primary schools in the sample \nof stayers than in the sample of switchers. Thus regression estimates based on stayers provide an \n 4\nupper bound to the Faith-primary school effect, whilst regression estimates based on switchers \nprovide a lower bound or a close-to-unbiased estimate of the causal effect of Faith primary \nschooling. Following the reasoning in Altonji et al. (2005b) \u2013 who suggest that the amount of \nselection on observables provides guidance on the amount of selection on unobservables \u2013 we \nassess the credibility of these arguments by looking at the degree of sorting on observable \ncharacteristics for these two sub-groups. We find that Faith-sector stayers have very different \nobservable characteristics from Secular-sector stayers, whereas switchers exhibit much less \nobservable sorting into Faith-primary schooling. In parallel, we find that Faith school stayers \nhave an age-11 test score advantage of up to 2.7 percentiles, while Faith school switchers \nexperience zero or negative gains. In practice, estimates based on switchers are likely to be a \nmuch better guide to the causal effects of primary Faith schooling than the estimates based on \nstayers, given that sorting into Faith primary schooling is much lower in the switchers\u2019 group. \n(d) To formalize these intuitions, we conclude our analysis using the method developed in \nAltonji et al. (2005b) to explicitly assess the robustness of our findings to varying degrees of \nselection on unobservables. Our findings suggest that with moderate degrees of selection on \nunobservables the estimated advantage of attending a Faith school vanishes. More importantly, \nwe find that when we constrain the amount of selection on unbservables to equal the amount of \nselection on observables, our estimates become zero or negative-insignificant. This is true for \npupils in our full sample, as well as for the subgroups of stayers and switchers. In a nutshell, our \nresults suggest that all of the advantage of Faith schooling can be explained by differences \nbetween pupils who attend Faith schools and those who do not. \nThe rest of paper has the following structure. The next section critically reviews the literature on \nthe topic and its methods. Section 3 explains the different types of schools that exist in England and \nthe data that we use. Section 4 sets out our empirical methods in more detail, and Section 5 discusses \nthe results that arise from these approaches. Section 6 concludes. \n \n 5\n2. A review of the methods used in previous studies \nEvidence on the academic impact of Faith schools in England is limited and based on shaky \nfoundations. Schagen et al. (2002) show that pupils in Faith secondary schools progress faster in \nEnglish (but not in Maths and Science), and also seem to pass more subjects overall in their age-16 \nexams. Benton et al. (2003) report that pupils in schools affiliated with non-mainstream Christian \n(i.e. not Catholic or Church of England) and Jewish denominations show faster progress between age \n11 and 16. Finally, in a study of two London boroughs with only 7 religious schools, Prais (2005) \nfinds quite strong Faith school advantages in Maths, particularly amongst weakest pupils. However, \nnone of these studies takes any steps to control for pupil background or otherwise deal with selection \non unobservable characteristics that influence educational progress. \nIn contrast, a fairly large literature on the topic has emerged in the US and has focussed on \nprivate Catholic schools \u2013 largely springing from the influential work of Coleman (1982)2. Overall, \nthis research finds that attendance at a Catholic school raises students\u2019 graduation rates and test \nscores, though there is variation across different demographic and geographical groups, and across \nsubject areas. The following discussion will focus on whether there is anything we can learn from the \nmethodological approaches used in the US and international literature, rather than the results per-se. \nAs noted above, an important difference between the US and England is that Faith schools in the US \n\u2013 mainly Catholic \u2013 are private-sector schools whereas Faith schools in England \u2013 mainly Catholic \nand Church of England \u2013 are part of the state-school system. Nevertheless, we face the same \nempirical issue as US researchers, namely that there is non-random sorting of pupils into Faith \nschools, such that religious school attendance is correlated with educationally-advantageous pupil \nand family characteristics. Therefore, researchers interested in the causal effect of religious education \nhave to look for a source of random variation in the probability of Faith school attendance that can be \nused as an instrument. Disappointingly, many of the instrument choices do not seem credible, and the \n                                                 \n2\n See Dronkers (2004) for a review of the European evidence on educational and behavioural effects of attending a Faith \nschool, and a detailed analysis of the historical and institutional determinants of religious education in Europe. \n 6\nevidence in Altonji et al. (2005a) and (2005b) is not supportive of any of those that are commonly \nused. \nOne commonly used instrument is family religion, because being Catholic is a strong \ndeterminant of attendance at a Catholic school (see Noell, 1982, Evans and Schwab, 1995 and in part \nof Neal, 1997). However, a priori, it is hard to believe that \u2018religiosity\u2019 is randomly assigned so that \nit does not correlate with unobservables that affect family attitudes towards education, school \nachievements and economic outcomes. In fact, recent studies show that a wide range of outcomes are \ncorrelated with religiosity, including income, disability, marriage, divorce (Gruber, 2005), economic \ngrowth (Weber, 1905, Barro and McCleary, 2003), and attitudes that are conducive to positive \neconomic outcomes (Guiso et al., 2003). On balance, we are not convinced that family religion is a \nuseful instrument for Faith school attendance.  \nOther instruments exploit information on the local \u2018supply\u2019 of Faith schooling based on the \ngeographical density of Catholic schools (Neal, 1997, Figlio and Stone, 1999, Grogger and Neal, \n2000). We find this idea unconvincing theoretically. Families surely decide to live near Catholic \nschools in part because they want their children to go to Catholic schools. In fact, a lot of existing \nevidence highlights the role of schools in housing choices (Black, 1999, Gibbons and Machin, 2006, \nKain, Staiger and Reigg, 2005). Therefore, instrumenting religious school attendance with distance \nto\/density of Catholic schools is unlikely to fix problems related to the endogeneity of Catholic \nschool choice. For similar reasons, local demographic characteristics, such as the proportion of \nCatholics in the neighbourhood, are inappropriate instruments if families have made the choice to \nlive in this type of community. Others have tried to use interactions of these variables as instruments, \nwhilst controlling for their levels (e.g. Sander, 1996), but the testing in Altonji et al. (2005a) suggests \nthis approach is not fully satisfactory. \nIn short, our argument is that previous research has neglected the problem of sorting induced by \nresidential choice, which implies that many geographical variables are inappropriate instruments for \nschool choice. To evaluate our critique, we partly replicated this type of empirical strategy on our \n 7\nEnglish data (described later) using instruments similar to those in Neal (1997).3 Although the \ninstruments are powerful in the first-stage equation, they are also significantly related to a variety of \nneighbourhood characteristics, including local average house prices, local unemployment rates and \nthe fraction of adults with higher levels of education in the local population. Additionally, the IV \ncoefficients are always above OLS estimates implying strong negative selection into Faith schools \nsuch that pupils with educationally disadvantageous characteristics choose Faith schooling. This \nnegative sorting is implausible in the English school system, as we show later. In conclusion, these \ninstruments are likely to be invalid and simply magnify the effect of unobservable parental \npreferences and school-side selection in our context. \nGiven the weaknesses in the IV approach, other researchers have tried alternative methods. \nJepsen (2003) uses value-added models to control for pupil background characteristics and finds no \nimpact of Catholic schools on test scores. In a different approach, Altonji et al. (2005a) and (2005b) \ninfer the degree of selection bias in the Catholic school effect from the extent of selection on \nobservable pupil characteristics, and conclude that whilst there is an impact on high school and \ncollege graduation rates, there is no influence on test scores. Our approach is closer to these more \nrecent US studies, but we have the advantage of a dataset on the population of students in England, \ncontaining information on pupil\u2019s prior attainments, demographics and details on precise \ngeographical location. Before discussing our methods, we outline the institutional context for Faith \nschooling in England, and the details of the dataset we will use. \n3. Institutional context and data \n3.1. School governance \nPrimary schools in the state-sector in England fall into four categories that differ in terms of \ngovernance, ownership of the school buildings, employment of teaching staff and control over pupil \n                                                 \n3\n Results are not tabulated for space reasons. However, a selection of our findings and some further discussions are \npresented in the on-line appendix. \n 8\nadmissions4. The key differences between these school types \u2013 Community, Foundation, Voluntary \nAided and Voluntary Controlled \u2013 are set out in Table 1. The most relevant distinctions for our \nanalysis relate to the composition of the governing board and to pupil admissions. \nState schools receive nearly all their funding from central government, through Local \nAuthorities (LAs) that are responsible for schools in their geographical domain. Schools, other than \nCommunity schools, are linked to a Faith or other local charitable organisation. All schools are run \nby a Governing Body composed of members elected from amongst parents and staff (Parent \nGovernors and Staff Governors), appointed by the LA (Representative Governors), appointed by the \nFaith or charitable organization that owns the school premises (Foundation\/Partnership Governors), \nand appointed from the community (e.g. local businesses) by the Governing Body. The Governing \nBody sets the strategic direction of the school, draws up school policies, sets targets and monitors \nperformance, although the day-to-day running is down to the head-teacher and his or her leadership \nteam. The constitution of the Governing Body is important because it determines how much \ninfluence various \u2018stakeholders\u2019 have in the way the school is run \u2013 in particular, the balance of \ninfluence by the LA and by the Faith or charitable foundation\/partnership. \n3.2. Pupil admissions  \nIn principle, admission to schools is based on parental preference, but in practice demand often \noutstrips the supply of places in popular schools and places are rationed on the basis of various \nschool-specific oversubscription criteria. For the period covered by this research, these criteria \nconformed to a central government Code of Practice on Admissions (and today, these criteria are \nregulated by law). According to these rules, primary schools should not select by aptitude. Instead, \nfor Faith-based schools, one of the overriding considerations for admission is typically attendance at \na local church or a recommendation from a local minister. For Secular schools, the distance between \n                                                 \n4\n In addition there is a small private, fee-paying sector, which we do not consider here. This educates around 6-7% of \npupils in England as a whole (even though they tend to be over-represented at the leading universities in the UK). \n 9\na child\u2019s home and school is one of the key considerations. Because of these criteria and the \nconstraints of travel costs, residential choice and school choice decisions are very closely linked. \nEven so, most households can choose between two or more schools from where they live, and have a \nchoice between a Secular and Faith school. \nAn important distinction relevant to our study is that Voluntary Aided and Foundation schools \nare responsible for their own pupil admissions and hence have more flexibility in deciding which \npupils will be enrolled when the school is oversubscribed. In fact, during the period under analysis, \nsome Faith schools and other schools that we class as \u2018autonomous\u2019 (see Section 3.1 below), were \nallowed to interview or otherwise screen families \u2013 ostensibly to determine their religious or other \nethical convictions. However, it has long been suspected that this resulted in covert selection based \non parental and pupil characteristics that are correlated with pupil ability5. In other school types, the \nLA is the admissions authority, which will apply much more mechanical rules when deciding which \npupils go to which schools. \n3.3. School classifications in our empirical work  \nGiven our emphasis on religious education and the heterogeneity in terms of governance and \nadmissions arrangements, we re-arrange schools into four categories. The breakdown is as follows: \n\u2022 Secular-non-autonomous: includes schools that have no religious affiliation and are \nCommunity or Voluntary Controlled. \n\u2022 Secular-autonomous: includes schools that have no religious affiliation but are \nFoundation or Voluntary Aided. \n\u2022 Faith-non-autonomous: includes schools that have a religious affiliation and are \nVoluntary Controlled. \n                                                 \n5\n West (2005) and West and Hind (2003) present detailed qualitative evidence on this issue, while Allen (2007) provides \nsome statistical analysis. Even recent news investigations have reported that Faith schools implicitly make admissions \nconditional on \u2018voluntary\u2019 church donations (The Times, 2008) \n 10 \n\u2022 Faith-autonomous: includes schools that have a religious affiliation and which are \nFoundation or Voluntary Aided. \nNote that the aim of this breakdown is twofold. On the one hand, we want to highlight the \nreligious affiliation of some state-sector schools in England. On the other hand, we want to \nemphasize the fact that some religious school, as well as some Secular schools, have more \nindependent governance structure and control over their admissions. These \u2018autonomous\u2019 \narrangements might: (i) affect the way in which schools admit pupils; and (ii) affect the way in which \nthe \u2018ethos\u2019 of the religious (or other) charity influences their daily functioning and strategic \nleadership. Our empirical work will explore differences in achievements of pupils in these schools, \nand consider to what extent these are caused by their religious character, as opposed to their \nautonomous arrangements6. First, however, we explain the way attainment is assessed in English \nprimary schools, and describe the data we will use. \n3.4. National curriculum and assessment \nCompulsory education in England is organised into five stages referred to as Key Stages. In the \nprimary phase, pupils enter school at age 4-5 in the Foundation Stage and then move on to Key Stage \n1 (ks1), spanning ages 5-6 and 6-7. At age 7-8 pupils move to Keys Stage 2 (ks2), sometimes \u2013 but \nnot usually \u2013 with a change of school7. At the end of ks2, when they are 10-11, children leave the \nprimary phase and go on to secondary school where they progress through Key Stages 3 and 4. At \nthe end of each Key Stage, pupils are assessed on the basis of standard national tests, and progress \n                                                 \n6\n Almost all Faith schools in England are either Church of England or Catholic schools. Only a minority of schools \n(enrolling less than 1% of pupils) is associated with other Faiths (e.g. Jewish or Muslim). Catholic schools account for \n53% of the Faith-autonomous sector, while nearly all schools in the Faith-non-autonomous sector are affiliated to the \nChurch of England. In earlier versions of this work, we studied whether there is any heterogeneity in our conclusions \nalong the dimensions of different religious affiliation, but failed to find any. Results are available from the authors. \n7\n In few cases there are separate Infants and Junior schools (covering Key Stage 1 and 2 respectively) and a few LAs \noperate a Middle School system (bridging the primary and secondary phases). We do not consider these schools here. \n 11 \nthrough the phases is measured in terms of Key Stage Levels. A point system is applied to convert \nthese levels into scores that represent about one term\u2019s (10-12 weeks) progress. \n3.5. The data \nThe UK\u2019s Department for Children, Families and Schools (DCSF) collects various data on school \nand pupils for funding and administrative purposes and to compile school performance tables. This \nNational Pupil Database (NPD) holds information on each pupil\u2019s assessment record in the Key \nStage tests throughout their school career. Since 2002, the data also includes information on pupils\u2019 \nschool, gender, age, ethnicity, language skills, special educational needs or disabilities, entitlement to \nfree school meals and other characteristics. Importantly, the data also includes home-postcode, which \ntypically encompasses 15 contiguous housing units, allowing us to control very carefully for \nresidential location. The NPD therefore provides us with a uniquely large and detailed dataset on \npupil characteristics and their test histories with details on the Levels reached in Maths, English and \nScience (although Science is not tested at ks1 so we do not make use of it). Additionally, for ks2 and \nbeyond, the data also contain raw scores in the various component tests.  \nIn our analysis, we use information on two cohorts: those aged 10-11 and sitting their ks2 tests \nin 2002 and 2003, who took their ks1 tests in 1998 and 1999 respectively. We can further observe \nwhich school these pupils go to when they move on to secondary school in 2003 and 2004. Various \nother data sources can also be merged in at school level \u2013 in particular each school\u2019s religious \naffiliation and the institutional types described above in Section 3.1. We will use this large and \ncomplex combined data set \u2013 which gives us information on around 1 million pupils in over 14,000 \nprimary schools in England \u2013 to estimate the influence of Faith schools on pupil achievement at the \nend of ks2 (age 11), conditional on achievement at ks1 (age 7). In the next section we set out the \nempirical strategy more precisely. \n \n \n 12 \n4. Empirical Model and Strategy \n4.1. Basic model \nAs discussed above (see Section 2 and 3.2), Faith school choice is potentially endogenous to pupil \nachievement. Firstly, families with a preference for religious schools may have characteristics that \ndirectly influence academic progress in their children. This pupil-side \u2018selection\u2019 (sorting) into Faith \nschooling is the main threat to the identification of the causal effect of Faith schooling relative to \nSecular schooling. Secondly, in the English context, Faith schools at both primary and secondary \nlevel have much greater control over their own pupil admissions than do Secular schools. Hence, \nadmission to a Faith school may be partly determined by educationally relevant attributes that \nschools can observe \u2013 but which we cannot \u2013 which adds to the identification problems8. As outlined \nin Section 2, we do not believe there are any credible instruments that would solve this identification \nproblem. Nevertheless, we do have a wealth of information on pupil characteristics, records of \nachievement, residential location and history of school attendance which can be used to bound the \nestimates of the effect of attending a Faith primary school.  \nThe basic model that we estimate is a standard pupil-level value-added model of achievement, \nwhich measures the association of various pupil and school characteristics with test scores at ks2, \nconditional on test scores at ks1. In our two-period empirical setup, the subscript 2 denotes the Key \nStage 2 phase, and achievement of pupil i  in Maths and English at ks2 ( 2iks ) builds on prior \nattainment in these subjects at ks1 ( 1iks ), and is modified by school-type factors ( 2j\u03b2 , a school effect \nthat is identical for different pupils in school type j  at Key Stage 2), observable personal\/family \n                                                 \n8\n In the US private Catholic school setting, these factors are theoretically related to the benefits of choosing a Faith \nschool, since attendance at a private school rather than a pubic school imposes financial costs. In England, conditional on \nplace of residence, admission to a state Faith school does not incur high additional costs relative to a non-Faith school. \nThe only likely cost is the effort of demonstrating some religious commitment through church attendance. \n 13 \ncharacteristics ( ix\u2032 , mainly ethnicity, free meal entitlement, gender, language) and unobserved \npupil\/family characteristics ( i\u03b7 , with 0)( =iE \u03b7 ): \n2 2 1 2( )i j i i i iks x g ks\u03b2 \u03b3 \u03b7 \u03b5\u2032= + + + +         (1) \nNote that ix\u2032 , itks  and 2i\u03b5  (other unobservables) all include school and school-type specific \ncomponents, but for simplicity we suppress any school or school-type subscripts on these variables. \nThe parameter of interest is 2j\u03b2 , i.e. the primary school-type effect for the various school types \ndiscussed in Section 3.3. The essential empirical problem is that family-side selection of schools and \nschool-side selection of pupils before ks2 imply that primary school choice is endogenous to the \nunobserved pupil\/family characteristics i\u03b7 : the unobservables that influence the rate of progress \nduring ks2 also influence school choice probabilities, so that 1( | , , ) 0i i iE ks x j k\u03b7 = \u2260 . Estimates of \n2j\u03b2  that do not control for [ ]|iE j\u03b7  are biased estimates of the expected impact of Faith school \nattendance. \n4.2. Prior achievement and home-postcode fixed-effects \nMost previous research on Faith school effects had to make-do without information on prior \nachievement. In contrast, we can control for prior achievements in a highly flexible fashion by \nadding to our specifications a large number of fixed-effects (183 dummies) for combinations of the \nlevels in Reading, Writing and Maths in ks1 tests. Even so, conditioning on prior test scores and \nobservable pupil characteristics is most likely an incomplete way of controlling for pupil selection \ninto different school types (see Manning and Pischke, 2006). So we must take further steps to control \nfor sorting into Faith schooling. \nPrevious literature has used geography-based instruments to deal with the problem of selection \non unobservables into Faith schooling. However, basic theories of urban economics suggest that \nhouseholds with different incomes and preferences sort into communities according to the benefit \nthey can derive from local amenities and the income available to pay for housing or taxes (Tiebout, \n1956). Given that residential choice and school choice decisions are closely linked, we believe it \n 14 \nmust be preferable to use place of residence to control for the endogeneity (via i\u03b7 ) of school choice, \nrather than use it as an instrument. Our data is ideal for this purpose, because the geographical detail \nand density of pupils means we can identify groups of pupils who live in the same postcode \n(typically 15 contiguous housing units), but attend different schools. We therefore include home-\npostcode fixed-effects in our models to partially condition out i\u03b7 , i.e. unobservable family income, \nbackground and preferences-related factors that are linked to residential choice. \n4.3. Secondary school-type and school fixed-effects \nControlling for place of residence will still not be enough to eliminate selection into Faith schooling \non the basis of unobservable factors in (1) if Faith school attendance is linked to different preferences \nor unobserved attributes even amongst pupils living in the same postcode. To tackle this issue, we \ntake advantage of the fact the selection into Faith schools occurs twice \u2013 once at primary and once at \nsecondary school \u2013 and assume that choice of secondary school conveys information about selection \nat the primary stage, including family preferences for Faith schooling and school preferences for \ndifferent types of family. In practise, the same types of school found at the primary phase (Table 1) \nare also found in the secondary phase, and we exploit this fact to control for components of i\u03b7  that \njointly influence primary and secondary school choices. We implement this idea by adding \nsecondary-school-type \u00d7 home-postcode fixed-effects or secondary-school \u00d7 home-postcode fixed-\neffects to our value-added model of equation (1)9. Identification comes from the comparison of \npupils who attend a different primary school type, but are otherwise \u2018matched\u2019 in the sense that they \nlive in the same postcode and attend the same secondary school\/type. Put simply, our argument is \n                                                 \n9\n The use future information to control for unobservables is similar to Grogger (1995) on the effects of arrest on labour \nmarket outcomes. The author compares the pre-1984 earnings of a sample of individual arrested in 1984 or earlier \u2013 the \n\u2018treated\u2019 group \u2013 to the pre-1984 earnings of a sample of individuals whose first arrest occurred after 1984 \u2013 the \u2018control\u2019 \ngroup. \n 15 \nthat pupils from Secular-primary schools are likely to be better comparators for pupils from Faith-\nprimary schools when they are in the same secondary school\/type.10 \nUnder plausible assumptions, estimates of the Faith-primary effect that control for secondary-\nschool\/type will be less biased than those that only control for prior achievement and home-postcode \nfixed-effects (plus other controls). Specifically, these assumptions are that: (i) selection into primary \nand secondary school depends on the same unobservable pupil\/family attributes i\u03b7 , and selection on \ni\u03b7  operates in the same direction at both phases; and (ii) other unobservable factors that determine \nFaith-school attendance at either primary or secondary phase are uncorrelated with i\u03b7 , or otherwise \nwith ks2 achievement (conditional on observable pupil attributes). \nHowever, controlling for secondary school\/type will not reduce the bias in our estimates of 2j\u03b2  \nif there is only weak correlation between the unobservables that influence Faith-primary attendance \nand the assignment to secondary school. In this case, secondary school choice conveys no \ninformation about selection into primary schools.  \nMore importantly, there are scenarios where controlling for secondary school\/type fixed-effects \ncould make our estimates more biased than they would be without these controls. These arise when \nthere is differential selection at the secondary level between pupils coming from Faith primary and \nthose coming from Secular primary schools, and this differential selection is strong relative to \nselection into Faith primary schooling. One such case occurs when there is positive selection on \nunobservables i\u03b7  into Faith-secondary schools, but Faith-secondary schools prefer pupils coming \nfrom Faith-primary schools (i.e. they set a lower threshold for i\u03b7 ), conditional on all other \ncharacteristics. A second possibility is that Faith-primary schools tend to raise student achievement, \n                                                 \n10\n Note that controlling for secondary-school fixed-effects might be problematic because of what Angrist and Pischke \n(2009) call the \u2018bad controls\u2019 problem (pp. 64-68). For example, if faith primary schooling is not endogenous in the first \nplace, then controlling for a characteristic (secondary schooling) that is potentially determined by faith primary schooling \nand correlated with achievements will make the bias worse than if the control had not been included. See further \ndiscussions in the body text and Appendix A for details. \n 16 \nand Faith-secondary schools screen pupils on the basis of value-added (i.e. pupil ks2 scores, \nconditional on background and ks1 scores). Both these cases involve negative selection of Faith-\nprimary pupils by i\u03b7  within secondary schools and secondary school types. This negative selection \noccurs because only the highest- i\u03b7  pupils from Secular primary schools are selected into Faith \nsecondary schools, whilst middle-to-high- i\u03b7  pupils from Faith primary schools are selected into \nFaith secondary schools. At the same time, the lowest- i\u03b7  pupils from Faith secondary schools are \nselected into Secular secondary schools, whilst the low-to-middle- i\u03b7  pupils from Secular primary \nschools end up in Secular secondary schools. As a consequence, Secular-primary pupils could be bad \ncomparators for Faith-primary pupils in the same secondary school\/type leading to a downward bias \nin the estimate of the effect of attending a Faith primary school.  \nNote however, that this is the case only if selection into Faith primary schools is relatively weak. \nOn the other hand, if there is strong positive selection into Faith primary schooling \u2013 as we claim \u2013 \nthis potential differential selection into Faith secondary schools that favours Faith primary pupils \ntends to work in our favour, and including secondary school\/type fixed-effects reduces the bias. This \nis because the low- i\u03b7  pupils from Faith primary schools who are forced out into the state secondary \nsector are better comparators for the low-to-middle- i\u03b7  pupils from the distribution in the Secular \nprimary sector. Similarly the high- i\u03b7  pupils drawn into the Faith sector from Secular primary schools \nwill be better compartors for the middle-high- i\u03b7  pupils from Faith primary schools who stay in the \nFaith sector (more details are provided in Appendix A). \nIn conclusion, the institutional arrangements in England mean that models with secondary \nschool\/type fixed-effects are likely to improve on OLS or specifications with postcode of residence \nfixed-effects. This is so for a number of reasons. Firstly, casual observation and the results we \npresent later indicate that there is strong positive selection into Faith schooling at both phases, and \nthat the main determinants of Faith school attendance at both education phases are persistent aspects \nof family background and preference. Indeed, one of the main criteria for admission into Faith \n 17 \nschools is some demonstration of religious commitment, which is unlikely to change between \nprimary and secondary phases. Similarly, it is unlikely that there is any differential selection at the \nsecondary phase by primary school-type of origin, because secondary schools do not screen either on \nprimary school attendance or on ks2 achievements. In fact, neither primary nor secondary schools \nhave any reliable measure of pupils\u2019 prior academic progress at the time when they admit them. \nPrimary schools admit pupils before any testing has taken place, whereas pupils apply to and receive \nadmission offers from secondary schools before they have taken their ks2 tests. In addition, formal \nlinks between primary and secondary schools are rare in England. Finally, West (2005) and West and \nHind (2003), report that the vast majority of (covertly) selective schools screened their pupils on the \nbasis of background criteria such as: children of employees; children of former pupils; children with \nfamily connections to the school; children with specific talents in music, dance or arts. The authors \ndo not report any evidence of selection based on general academic progress during primary \neducation, or on the type of primary school attended. \n4.4. Bounding the effects using switchers and stayers \nThe possibility of differential selection into secondary schools according to Faith primary status \nleads us to devise a bounding exercise that exploits the movements in and out of Faith schooling at \nthe transition between primary and secondary phases. To implement this exercise, we estimate the \nprimary school-type effects 2j\u03b2  in two pupil sub-groups, namely: (i) the stayers, who attend the \nsame school type in both the primary and secondary phases; and (ii) the switchers, who attend \ndifferent school types in each of these phases. As we illustrate in Appendix A, regression estimates \nbased on the comparison of Faith-primary-Faith-secondary stayers with Secular-primary-Secular-\nsecondary stayers provide an upper bound to the impact of Faith-primary schools on achievement. In \ncontrast, estimates based on the comparison of Faith-primary-Secular-secondary switchers with \n 18 \nSecular-primary-Faith-secondary switchers provide a lower bound.11 These claims hold true if: (i) \nthere is positive selection into Faith-secondary schools on the basis of pupil\/family background i\u03b7 ; \nand (ii) Faith secondary schools do not discriminate in favour of Secular primary pupils, i.e. Faith \nsecondary schools either do not discriminate on the basis of the primary school-type, or they are \nmore likely to admit Faith primary pupils than Secular primary ones, conditional on i\u03b7 . \nThe explanation for these claims about the bounds provided by the stayers and switchers is as \nfollows. Suppose that Faith secondary schools admit Faith primary school pupils whose i\u03b7  falls \nabove some threshold \u03c4 , whereas they only admit Secular primary pupils above a higher threshold \n\u03c4 \u2032 . The distribution of i\u03b7  amongst Secular-primary-Secular-secondary pupils is right truncated at \u03c4 \u2032 , \nwhereas the distribution of i\u03b7  amongst Faith-primary-Faith-secondary pupils is left truncated at \n\u03c4 \u03c4 \u2032< . The difference in mean i\u03b7  between Faith-primary-Faith-secondary pupils and Secular-\nprimary-Secular-secondary pupils in these truncated distributions is therefore necessarily greater than \nthe difference in means between the un-truncated distributions of Faith-primary and Secular-primary \npupils. As a consequence, the stayers\u2019 comparison provides an upward biased estimate of the effect \nof Faith schooling. In contrast, the distribution of i\u03b7  amongst Secular-primary-Faith-secondary \nswitchers is left truncated at \u03c4 \u2032 , whereas the distribution of i\u03b7  for Faith-primary-Secular-secondary \npupils is right truncated at \u03c4 . Thus, the difference in mean i\u03b7  between Faith-primary-Secular-\nsecondary pupils and Secular-primary-Faith-secondary pupils in these truncated distributions is \nnecessarily negative (even if \u03c4 \u03c4 \u2032= ), so that the switchers\u2019 comparison provides a downward biased \nestimate of the effect of Faith schooling. \nBefore moving on, two further cases are worth discussing. Firstly, if switching in and out of \nFaith schooling during the primary-to-secondary transition is random (conditional on i\u03b7 ), then the \ncomparison of Faith-primary-Secular-secondary pupils with Secular-primary-Faith-secondary pupils \n                                                 \n11\n In practise, when applying this method, we have four school types (two Faith and two Secular), but label as stayers \npupils who stay in the same school type in both phases, and as switchers those moving between any of these four types. \n 19 \nprovides an unbiased estimate of the causal Faith-primary effect on achievement. This is because in \nthis case switchers-in and switchers-out of Faith schooling are likely to be well matched in terms of \nunobservable characteristics that are relevant to primary school achievements, since they are simply \n\u2018marginal participants\u2019 in Faith education. As detailed in Section 4.3, we argue that this is the most \nlikely scenario: Faith-school selection is based mainly on persistent pupil\/family background \ncharacteristics i\u03b7 , but for \u2018marginal participants\u2019 the decision to exit or enter Faith schooling on \ntransition from primary to secondary school is more likely to be related to the quality of local \nsecondary schools or to changes in family circumstances, neither of which affects ks2 achievements. \nIn our empirical evidence below, we will back up this claim by showing that switchers exhibit much \nless sorting into Faith-primary schooling by observable characteristics than do pupils in the whole \npopulation or in the stayers\u2019 group. Secondly, families might choose secondary school type taking \ninto account the \u2018quality of the match\u2019 between the child and the sector in the primary stage as \nrepresented by 2i\u03b5  in equation (1), with a low realisation of 2i\u03b5  inducing families to switch school \ntypes. The rationale for doing so is not self-evident because families cannot observe the \ncounterfactual match in the sector they did not attend, and the transition from primary to secondary \nschool involves leaving the school that disappointed them in any case. Nevertheless, even under this \nscenario, the stayers\u2019 comparison provides an upper bound to the causal effect of Faith primary \nschooling, whereas the switchers\u2019 analysis yields estimates that are always less biased than in the full \npopulation of pupils and \u2013 under the most plausible assumptions \u2013 close to unbiased. Full details are \nprovided in Appendix A. \nIn conclusion, it is useful to summarise our arguments about estimating the causal effect of \nFaith-primary schooling using either specifications that include secondary school\/type fixed-effects, \nor exploiting the switchers\u2019 and the stayers\u2019 comparisons. We have argued that: \n(a) Secondary school\/type fixed-effects reduce the bias in our estimates if there is no \ndifferential selection by family\/pupil background ( i\u03b7 ) into Faith secondary schools according to \nFaith primary status; or if any differential selection by family\/pupil background into Faith \n 20 \nsecondary schools according to Faith primary status is weak relative to selection by family\/pupil \nbackground into Faith primary schools. \n(b) Under all plausible scenarios, the stayers\u2019 comparison provides an upper bound, and the \nswitchers\u2019 comparison either a lower bound or a close-to-unbiased estimate of the parameter of \ninterest. This is so unless Faith secondary schools discriminate against Faith primaries and\/or \nconsiderations about \u2018quality of the match\u2019 at primary school ( 2i\u03b5 ) are paramount when \nchoosing secondary school type, which we believe is very unlikely. \n(c) Under the conditions which we believe prevail in England, results based on the sample of \nswitchers yield close-to-unbiased estimates of 2j\u03b2 . \nAlthough we cannot directly test these conjectures relating to unobservable selection, we draw \non Altonji et al. (2005b) who suggest that it is likely that the amount of selection on unobservables \n\u2018tracks\u2019 the amount of selection on observables. Therefore the degree of selection on unobservable \ncharacteristics i\u03b7  across pupil sub-groups can be explored by looking at the degree of selection on \nobservable characteristics 1iks  and ix\u2032 . In practice, this means that we study how the estimates 2\u02c6 j\u03b2  \nchange as we move from the whole population of pupils to the subgroups of stayers and switchers, \nand that we compare these changes with the degree of sorting on observable characteristics 1[ | ]iE ks j  \nand 2[ | ]iE x j  as we move across the groups. By this method, we can gauge the extent to which \ndifferences in 2\u02c6 j\u03b2  in these sub-samples might arise through differences in selection on unobservable \nfactors [ | ]iE j\u03b7 . \n4.5. Calibrating selection on unobservables to selection on observables \nTo formalize these intuitions, we conclude our analysis using the methods in Altonji et al. (2005b) to \nexplicitly assess the robustness of our estimates to varying degrees of selection on unobservables. In \nparticular, we investigate: (i) how much positive selection on unobservables we need in order to \ndrive our estimates of the Faith primary effect to zero; and (ii) how robust our estimates are to the \n 21 \nassumption that there is an equal amount of selection on observables and unobservables. Once again, \nthis exercise is carried out for all pupils in the sample, as well as separately for switchers and stayers.  \nThe results from this investigation will serve two purposes. First, we will use them to show that \nthe estimated Faith-primary advantage vanishes when we constrain the amount of selection on \nobservables to equal the amount of selection on observables. Secondly, we will use this method to \ndirectly validate our intuition that Faith school stayers are more positively sorted into religious \nschools in terms of both their observables and unobservables, than switchers. This will further lend \nsupport to our claims that estimates of the effect of attending a Faith primary school for switchers \nand stayers help us bound the causal impact of religious education, and that estimates based on the \nsample of switchers are closer to what the \u2018true\u2019 causal impact of Faith schooling would be in the \nabsence of sorting and selection. Full details of our implementation of the Altonji et al. (2005b) \nmethodology are provided in Appendix B.  \n5. Results and discussion \n5.1. Descriptive statistics \nThe basic facts about the association of pupil ks2 attainments and the type of primary school attended \nare summarised in Table 2. The school categories were explained in Section 3 above. The table \nshows the means and standard deviations of pupil ks2 test scores, where the raw test scores are \nconverted into percentiles. Notice that in all the empirical analysis that follows we will work with the \naverage of one pupil\u2019s percentile in the Maths and English distribution because we found no \ninteresting differences between these two subjects. Summary statistics are shown in Row 1 for the \nwhole sample, and then split by broad school type. The figures show the key feature that we wish to \nanalyse: pupils emerging from primary schools that are classified as Faith schools under our \ndefinitions have higher levels of attainment than those emerging from Secular schools. The \ndifference is about 4.75 percentiles in the pupil test score distribution. \nSplitting this gap into the finer school classifications defined above, we see that the apparent \nFaith-primary effect in Row 2 is more specifically associated with Faith schools that we classify as \n 22 \nautonomous. Secular schools with comparable institutional arrangements similarly show higher \naverage test scores than other Secular-non-autonomous schools. Next we consider to what extent \nthese higher scores are attributable to differences in the characteristics between pupils who enter \nthese schools and those who do not. \n5.2. Regression estimates of sorting on pupil background and ks1 scores \nFirstly, we show that there are important and significant differences between school types in terms of \nthe observable characteristics of pupils at the beginning of the Key Stage 2, i.e. the age 7-11 phase. \nTable 3, Row 1 reports overall means and standard deviations of ks1 attainment and background \ncharacteristics. Table 3, Rows 2-5 report results from regressions of these characteristics on school-\ntype dummies (with Secular-non-autonomous schools as the baseline). The pupil characteristics \nincluded in our analysis are: ks1 level points (here averaged across Reading, Writing and Maths); \neligibility for free school meals; special educational need status (SEN); White ethnic origin; and \nEnglish as a first language.  \nIt is evident from this table that autonomous types of schools (Faith and Secular) are at an \nadvantage over standard non-autonomous Secular primary schools, both in terms of ks1 achievement \nand background characteristics usually associated with educational disadvantage. Pupils start off in \nautonomous schools in Key Stage 2 with ks1 test scores that are, on average, 1.2 to 1.7 Level points \n(1 Level point is equivalent to one term) ahead of their counterparts in Secular-non-autonomous \nschools. This is around 15% of one standard deviation and about the same as the advantage in terms \nof final scores at age-11 reported in Table 2. Certainly, this difference in ks1 between pupils in \ndifferent school types may partly emerge because some pupils have already gained or lost out from \nthe time spent in their respective primary schools. However, pupils in Faith-autonomous schools are \nalso much less likely to be on a low income that entitles them to free school meals, more likely to be \nWhite and more likely to have English as their first language. The advantage of these schools in \nterms of lower free school meal entitlement also amounts to 15-20% of one standard deviation, and it \nis impossible that these differences in background can be a consequence of Faith school attendance.  \n 23 \nSome of these disparities can be explained by differences in geographical setting, but not all: \nColumns 6-10 report the same regressions once we include home-postcode fixed-effects, and show \nthat many differences persist even across pupils who live in the same postcode, but attend different \ntypes of school. These differences are less marked in terms of ethnicity and languages, but still \nstrong in terms of free school meal entitlement and prior attainment. Pupils in Secular-autonomous \nand Faith-autonomous schools still start the Key Stage 2 phase with ks1 scores that are 0.7 to 1.2 \npoints ahead of Secular-non-autonomous pupils who live in the postcode, and are between 2.5 and 4 \npercentage points less likely to be eligible for free meals (on a base of 20 percent). \n5.3. Regression estimates of progress between ks1 and ks2 \nNext we turn to regression estimates of the model in equation (1). Results from our first set of \nexercises are shown in Table 4. The dependent variable is the pupil-mean of the Maths and English \ntest percentile scores described in Table 2. Column (1) provides information on the raw differences \nbetween school types (similar to those in Table 2) by regressing ks2 test scores on school-type \ndummies (and academic year dummies).  \nIn Column (2) we control for ks1 achievement using 183 dummies for combinations of levels in \nMaths, Reading and Writing attainment groups. Adding these controls more than halves the \ndifferences between mean ks2 scores of pupils attending different types of school. Even then, pupils \nin Faith schools and autonomous schools still appear to do better despite starting from the same ks1 \nbase. By the time they take their ks2 tests, students in Faith-autonomous schools are nearly 2.5 \npercentiles above pupils in non-autonomous Secular schools who were in the same ks1 achievement \ngroup12. \n                                                 \n12\n Note that we have tried other specifications of the value-added model. A common alternative approach assumes that \n( ' )it j i iks x t\u03b2 \u03b3 \u03b5= + + , so that 2 1 'i i j i iks ks x\u03b2 \u03b3 \u03b5\u2212 = + + , in which case we can just regress the difference between \npupil\u2019s ks2 and ks1 point scores on school type dummies and other background characteristics. The results from this \nexercise convey a similar message to that in Table 4. They are available upon request. \n 24 \nColumn (3) introduces the school and pupil level controls detailed in Appendix Table A1 \nalongside home-postcode fixed-effects to control for unobserved family\/pupil background effects \nthat are common to close neighbours. The gap between Secular-non-autonomous schools and other \nschool types closes.13 We now find no evidence of an advantage for pupils in non-autonomous Faith \nschools over Secular schools. However, pupils emerge with a slightly higher ks2 scores from \nautonomous schools \u2013 both Faith and Secular \u2013 than they do from non-autonomous schools. We \nsuspect that this advantage has still in part to do with selection on pupil characteristics that are \ncorrelated with progress between ks1 and ks2 since the evidence in Table 3 suggests that pupils \nattending different school types from the same postcode are still not balanced on observables. \nHowever, we cannot rule out real academic advantages from the more autonomous governance \nstructures of Faith-autonomous (Voluntary-Aided) and Secular-autonomous (Foundation) schools. \nWe next estimate equation (1) allowing for secondary-school-type \u00d7 home-postcode fixed-\neffects (Column (4)) or secondary-school \u00d7 home-postcode fixed-effects (Column (5)), following the \nstrategy described in Section 4.3. The results in both specifications reveal a very small residual gap \nbetween pupils emerging from autonomous primaries and those from baseline schools \u2013 at around \n0.8-1 percentile of the pupil distribution or 0.02-0.04 of the standard deviation in test scores. A \nstriking finding emerging from the results so far is that Faith affiliation is not, in itself, an indicator \nof higher educational standards. Faith-autonomous schools have mean attainments that are only 0.15 \npercentiles higher than Secular-autonomous schools (in Column (5)), and not significantly so (the F-\ntest for equality of the two parameters has a p-value of 0.7236). Moreover, pupils from Faith schools \n                                                 \n13\n Identification with home-postcode fixed-effects requires multiple school types per postcode, so we restrict the sample \nto postcodes where this condition holds, leaving us with a much smaller sample. Note that we have re-estimated the \nspecification of Column (2) on the sample of Column (3) to check that the documented attenuation in the coefficients is \nnot attributable to a change in the pupil composition arising from the reduced sample. We found this was not the case. \nFor example, the effect of attending a Faith-autonomous school was estimated to be 2.107 (s.e. 0.182) when using the \nspecification in Column (2) on the sample of Column (3). \n 25 \nseem to do slightly worse than pupils from Secular schools when admissions are not under their \ncontrol14. This indicates that religious character is not, on its own, linked to better school \nperformance. \nNote that although the estimated ks2 Faith-primary effect is very modest compared to some of \nthe previous findings in the literature, it could still be upward biased by selection into Faith-primary \nschools amongst pupils who live in the same postcode and go on to attend the same secondary \nschool: the last five columns of Table 3 suggest that, even conditional on secondary-school \u00d7 home-\npostcode fixed-effects, pupils attending autonomous primary schools are associated with \neducationally advantageous observable characteristics. However, in Section 4.3, we have also \nemphasised that estimates using secondary-type or secondary-school fixed-effects could be \ndownward biased by differential selection into secondary schools on the basis of Faith-primary \nattendance or ks1-to-ks2 value added. We therefore next proceed to bound our estimates using the \nstrategy described in Section 4.4. \n5.4. Regression estimates on sub-samples of stayers and switchers \nIn this section, we implement the strategy described in Section 4.4 that compares estimates for two \nsubgroups of pupils, namely: (i) the stayers, who attend the same school type in both the primary and \nsecondary phases; and (ii) the switchers, who attend different school types in each of these phases. \nAs outlined in Section 4.4, under plausible conditions the stayers\u2019 estimates will provide an upper \nbound, and the switchers\u2019 estimates a lower bound to the causal effect of Faith-primary schooling on \nachievement. However, we also argued that estimates based on the switchers\u2019 group are much more \nlikely to be close to the causal Faith-primary effect than those based on the sample of stayers or on \nthe population of pupils, since we expect sorting to be much weaker among switchers. To support \nthis conjecture, we begin by presenting estimates of the degree of selection into Faith-primary \n                                                 \n14\n The null hypothesis that the coefficients for Faith-autonomous schools and Secular-autonomous schools are equal to \nthe parameter for Faith-non-autonomous schools is rejected with p-values of 0.000 and 0.037 p-value, respectively. \n 26 \nschools based on observable characteristics in the stayers\u2019 and switchers\u2019 groups separately. We then \ngo on to estimate the Faith-primary effect on ks2 in these two groups separately. \nDescriptive statistics on school type transitions between primary and secondary phases are \nshown in Appendix Table A2. About 77.5% of pupils in Secular-non-autonomous primary schools \ntransits to Secular-non-autonomous secondary schools. Similarly, 54.8% of those attending a \nSecular-autonomous primary transit to a Secular-autonomous school for their secondary education. \nTogether, this implies that 54% of our sample stays in the same type of Secular school in both \nphases, with just over half (52%) in Community schools controlled by the Local Education Authority \n(and approximately 66% staying in the Secular sector overall). Looking at Faith-school pupils, more \nthan 50% of pupils in Faith-autonomous primary schools (about 10% of our sample) stay within the \nFaith-autonomous sector during secondary education (while only 2% stay in the Faith-non-\nautonomous sector in both phases). On the other hand, some 170,000 pupils (18%) switch out of the \nFaith sector at the secondary phase, and around 39,000 (4.2%) switch into it. If our conjectures about \nthe relationship between school choice and family background are correct, we would expect to find \nvery different estimates of the Faith-autonomous primary school effect amongst these different \ngroups, and very different patterns of sorting along observable lines into Faith-autonomous schools. \nEstimates of the degree of observable sorting into Faith-primary schools within the stayers\u2019 and \nswitchers\u2019 sub-samples are presented in Table 5. In the top panel, we present the results from \nregressions of individual observable characteristics on school-type dummies and home-postcode \nfixed-effects for the sub-sample of stayers (i.e. pupils in all the diagonal cells of Appendix Table \nA2). This exercise is similar to the one presented in Table 3. Individuals who stay in Faith-\nautonomous and Secular-autonomous schools over both phases of education have higher ks1 \nachievement than pupils in Secular-non-autonomous schools. They are also less likely to be eligible \nfor free school meals and to have special education needs. They are more likely to be of White origin \nand to speak English as their first language. Importantly, the differences are larger for the sub-sample \nof stayers considered here than for the population as a whole (compare with Columns 6 to 10 of \nTable 3). \n 27 \nConsider now the sample of switchers (i.e. we exclude from our sample pupils in the diagonal \ncells of the transition matrix of Appendix Table A2). Results about observable sorting within this \ngroup are presented in the lower panel of Table 5. Although there are still some significant \ndifferences between pupils attending Faith-autonomous schools and those attending Secular-non-\nautonomous schools in the primary phase, these are much lower in magnitude than we found in the \npopulation (Table 3), or in the stayers\u2019 sample (Table 5, top panel). More generally, the differences \nin background characteristics between Faith-primary and Secular-primary pupils in the switchers\u2019 \ngroup are much smaller than differences for pupils in the population or the sample of stayers.  \nThese findings support our conjecture that there is much less sorting into Faith-primary schools \nwithin the switchers\u2019 group than among the stayers. Under the assumption that the amount of \nselection on observable characteristics is a guide to the amount of selection on unobservables \n(Altonji et al., 2005b), this evidence also supports our argument that stayers and switchers can be \nused to bound the estimates of the Faith-primary effect on achievement at ks2. Moreover, the low \nlevel of sorting in the switchers\u2019 group relative to the stayers implies that estimates based on the \nformer will be much closer to the unbiased causal impact of Faith-primary schooling. \nOur results on the effect of primary school types on ks2 achievement for stayers and switchers \nare presented in Table 6. The regressions use the same specification as in Table 4, Column (3), i.e. \nthey are conditional on highly flexible controls for ks1 scores, home-postcode fixed-effects and other \ncontrol variables (see note to the table for details). We focus our discussion on the estimated effect of \nautonomous schools, since we have already shown that it is only in these schools that there appear to \nbe significant educational advantages.  \nFor the sample of stayers, attending Faith-autonomous schools in both phases, we find a ks2 test \nscores advantage of 2.7 percentiles, relative to pupils attending Secular-non-autonomous schools in \nboth phases; for Secular-autonomous school pupils this figure is around 2.2 percentiles. These \nestimates are 60-100% higher than those found for the full sample in Table 4. On the other hand, we \nfind that the ks2 performance gap of Faith-autonomous schools for the sub-sample of switchers is \nbelow zero, although not significant. Stated differently, pupils who attended a Faith-autonomous \n 28 \nschool up to age 11, but move to a Faith non-autonomous or a Secular secondary school, perform no \nbetter \u2013 if not marginally worse \u2013 at ks2 than pupils who attend a Secular-non-autonomous primary \nschool up to age-11, but go on to attend either an autonomous or a Faith secondary school thereafter. \nA similar pattern emerges when considering the effect of attending a Secular-autonomous primary \nschool for the sample of switchers. These findings count against better quality in either Faith-\nautonomous or Secular-autonomous schools being the driving factor behind the better test results \npresented earlier: the estimated advantage of Faith- and Secular-autonomous school attendance \nclosely tracks the degree of selection on observable characteristics, which makes pupil sorting a more \nplausible explanation for any difference in average pupil performance15. \nWe can further see this by considering a few simple descriptive statistics. Consider first the full \nsample of pupils. Looking at Table 3 (Columns (6) to (10)), it can be seen that pupils in Faith-\nautonomous schools are about 11-12% of one standard deviation above pupils in Secular-non-\nautonomous schools in terms of observable characteristics that are associated to higher ks2 test \nscores (e.g. ks1 test scores and free-meal eligibility). In turn, they have a value-added advantage of \naround 6% of one standard deviation (see Table 4, Column (3)), about half the advantage in terms of \npredetermined observable characteristics. Next, for the sub-sample of stayers, the advantage in terms \nof observable characteristics is up to 20% of one standard deviation (see top panel of Table 5), while \nthe advantage in value-added is about 10% (as from Column (1) of Table 6). On the other hand, for \nthe sample of switchers, the disadvantage in ks1 attainments and free-meal entitlement (the most \nimportant drivers of ks2 test scores in our models) is about 2.5% of one-standard deviation (see Panel \nB of Table 5), while the disadvantage in value-added, although insignificant, is about 1% of one-\nstandard deviation (Column (2) of Table 6). There is clearly a close relationship between selection on \nobservables into Faith-autonomous schools and the magnitude of our estimates of their ks2 \n                                                 \n15\n Incidentally, our evidence does not point to any beneficial impact of attending a Faith primary school for more \ndisadvantaged pupils, like those eligible for free school meals. This is at odds with most of the US-based evidence. \n 29 \nadvantage, which once again suggests that most of the documented effects of Faith-autonomous \nschooling are likely to be driven by pupil sorting and school-side selection. \n5.5. Robustness to varying degrees of selection on unobservables \nTo conclude our analysis, we formalize the arguments presented above using a variant of the Altonji \net al. (2005b) procedure outlined in Section 4 and Appendix B. In particular, we investigate: (a) how \nmuch positive selection on unobservables we need in order to drive our estimates to zero; and (b) \nhow robust our estimates are to the assumption that there is an equal amount of selection on \nobservables and unobservables. We study these issues for all our pupils in the sample, and separately \nfor stayers and switchers. Note that, for computational feasibility, we use regression specifications in \nwhich we replace home-postcode fixed-effects with 150 LA dummies, so our baseline estimates are \nhigher than the comparable specifications in Table 4 and Table 616. We also consider only pupils \nchoosing Faith-autonomous or Secular-non-autonomous schools, since we need a dichotomous \n\u2018treatment\u2019 variable. Our estimates are presented in Table 7, where \u03c1  in the column heading shows \nthe constraint that we impose on the \u2018strength\u2019 of selection on unobservables (see Appendix B for \ndetails). \nThe top panel of the table reports our findings for the full sample of pupils. In the first column \nwe present results when we constrain our model to have no selection on unobservables. This estimate \nis used as a benchmark and is comparable to that in Column (3) of Table 4. As soon as we allow for \nsome selection on unobservables, the positive effect of attending a Faith-autonomous primary school \nis eroded. For example, with 060.0=\u03c1 , the effect is about 0.6 of a percentile, while it turns \ncompletely insignificant and very small (0.06 of a percentile) when 080.0=\u03c1 . Importantly, the \nvalue of 080.0=\u03c1  also corresponds to the point at which the amount of selection on unobservables \nequals the amount of selection on observables in the full sample. Given the importance of selection \n                                                 \n16\n We use a modified version of the two-step treatreg command in Stata 11. We need to exclude the postcode fixed-\neffects, because the model requires a probit first-stage and there are too many postcodes for feasible estimation. \n 30 \non observables (note the R-squared\u2019s in Table 4), the value of 080.0=\u03c1  is arguably an upper limit \nto the amount of selection on unobservables in our setting. If this is the case, then the estimate \nreported in the last column of Table 7 can be interpreted as a lower bound to the effect of attending a \nFaith-autonomous primary school17. On the other hand, we have not controlled as well for other \naspects of family background here as we did in our main regressions, because it was infeasible to \ninclude home-postcode fixed-effects. As a result, our findings might still overstate the benefits of \nattending a religious autonomous primary school.  \nNext we repeat this analysis for the sample of stayers. Results are presented in Panel B of Table \n7. Once again we find that the estimates of the effect of attending a Faith-autonomous primary school \nare very sensitive to sorting on unobservables. The estimated coefficient becomes statistically \ninsignificant as we raise selection on unobservables to 100.0=\u03c1 . Further, when we impose an equal \namount of selection on observables and unobservables )123.0( =\u03c1 , the estimated Faith-primary \nschool effect becomes negative at -0.379, although statistically insignificant.  \nFinally, in Panel C of Table 7, we present our findings for the sub-group of switchers. In this \ncase, even with extremely small degrees of selection on unobservables )020.0( =\u03c1  or with equal \nselection on observables and unobservables )019.0( =\u03c1 , our estimate becomes statistically \ninsignificant and very close to zero (0.230-0.254 of a percentile). \nAll in all, this analysis reveals some patterns that support our previous intuitions and evidence \nabout sorting for the sub-samples of switchers and stayers. Firstly, we confirm that the sample of \nstayers is significantly more positively selected into Faith-primary schools than other groups \n)123.0( =\u03c1 . However, an equal amount of selection on observables and unobservables drives our \nestimates of the Faith-primary effect down below zero. This finding squares well with our simple \n                                                 \n17\n Obviously, if we forced \u03c1  to assume negative values, i.e. if we assumed negative selection on unobservables, then we \nwould find estimates that lie above those documented in Table 4 and Table 6. However, negative sorting is unlikely in \nEngland given the structure of the school system and the evidence provided above.  \n 31 \naccount presented above, where we highlighted that the positive gap in achievements at ks2 for \nstayers in Faith-autonomous schools is in fact smaller than the gap in their educationally \nadvantageous characteristics. Secondly, and more importantly, for the sub-sample of switchers, we \nfind a very small degree of selection into religious schooling )019.0( =\u03c1  based on observable \ncharacteristics, which we argue is likely to provide an upper bound to the amount of selection on \nunobservables for this group too. This provides strong support for our claim that we are more likely \nto identify the causal effect of attending a Faith primary school in the absence of selection and \nsorting by focussing on the sample of switchers. To reiterate, in our richest specifications in Column \n2 of Table 6 we find that the effect of Faith-primary schooling for switchers is not statistically \ndifferent from zero. \nOne concern over the application of the Altonji et al. (2005b) methodology in our context is the \nuse of prior achievements (ks1) in the selection equation. This is because ks1 test scores are very \nhighly correlated with ks2 achievements, and so tend to dominate the set of explanatory factors in the \nachievement equation (1). As a robustness check, we replicated our analysis using an alternative \nvalue-added specification in which we replace the dependent variable with the outcome (ks2 \u2013 ks1), \nand exclude ks1 from both the main and selection equations (but otherwise keep the same set of \ncontrols as in Table 7; see footnote 12 for more details about this alternative specification). Results \nobtained following this approach confirm our previous conclusions: we still find that the sample of \nstayers is more positively selected ( 085.0=\u03c1 ) than the sample of switchers ( 006.0=\u03c1 ), and that \nfor both groups of pupils the effect of attending a Faith-autonomous school is no longer positive and \nsignificant once we impose an equal amount of selection on observables and unobservables. In \nparticular, for the group of switchers this effect stands at 0.51 with a standard error of 0.25. \n6. Conclusions \nWe have provided a number of estimates of the effect of attending a Faith school in England on \npupils\u2019 educational progress between ages 7 and 11. Our approach has deliberately avoided \ninstrumental variable strategies adopted by previous work in the field, because we do not believe (at \n 32 \nleast for the English setting) that there are any credible instruments for Faith school attendance that \nare uncorrelated with family background, either directly or through residential sorting. Instead we \nhave exploited the fact that we have around one million pupils in our database, which, in conjunction \nwith precise details about place of residence, academic record and future school choice, allows us to \ncarefully control for factors that influence the propensity to attend Faith schools. \nWe make no claim to have put a precise number on the causal impact of Faith school attendance \nand have demonstrated that the magnitude of any difference between Faith school pupils and Secular \nschool pupils depends substantially on the way we cut the sample. What then are we to make of these \nresults? One thing that seems clear is that, Faith schools \u2013 and other schools that have autonomous \nadmissions and governance arrangements \u2013 tend to admit \u2018better\u2019 pupils, and there is no \nunambiguous performance advantage that cannot be attributed purely to pupil-side sorting into these \nschools, or to school-side selection of pupils likely to show the fastest progress. Pupils who attended \nFaith or autonomous schools at primary phase, but not at the secondary phase, do no better in \nprimary school than pupils who attend Faith or autonomous schools at the secondary phase, but not \nat the primary phase. The Faith or autonomous-school gap in attainments at primary phase seems \nlargely attributable to differences between those pupils who choose to attend such schools at any \nstage in their educational careers, and those who choose never to do so or are excluded from doing so \nby school selection procedures. \nIn any case, we find no evidence that Faith affiliation lies behind the test-score advantage \ncommonly attributed to Faith schools in England. A generous reading of the results suggests that \npupils in schools that have more autonomous governance and admissions structures \u2013 a set that \nincludes Faith schools \u2013 do progress marginally faster. A pupil starting in an autonomous school at \nage 7 could expect to be one percentile higher in the distribution of pupil attainments by age 11 than \na comparable pupil attending a standard Secular-non-autonomous school, even when these two \npupils live in the same postcode and go on to choose the same secondary school. Our upper bound \nestimates put this figure at 2.7 percentiles.  \n 33 \nTo put this in perspective, we draw on the results in Machin and McNally (2004) that report \nlabour market returns to age-10 reading tests, based on the 1970 British Cohort Study18. Their figures \n(reported in their Table 7) indicate that the labour market return to a one percentile move up the \nattainment distribution at age 10 was around 0.0042%, conditional on family background. In other \nwords, the labour market impact of these small school quality differences seems very slight. \nCertainly, the cumulative effect over 12 years of compulsory schooling could be more substantial \nthan this would suggest, and there may be other impacts from schooling of religious ethos \u2013 on \nstaying on rates and child wellbeing for example \u2013 that are outside the scope of this study. However, \npupils in Faith schools that are under close Local Authority control do not progress any faster than \nsimilar pupils in comparable Secular schools. Any performance impact from \u2018Faith\u2019 schools in \nEngland seems to be closely linked to their autonomous governance and admissions arrangements, \nand not to religious character.  \n                                                 \n18\n The 1970 British Cohort Study follows a cohort of children born in one week in 1970 through to adulthood.

A simple model of selection \nSuppose attainments at Key Stage 2 are determined by the type of school attended (j), unobserved \nfamily characteristics i\u03b7  and a random error term 2i\u03b5  as in equation (1) in the main text: \n( )2 2 1 2i j i i i iks x g ks\u03b2 \u03b3 \u03b7 \u03b5\u2032= + + + +             (A1) \nConsider two school types, Secular (j = 0) and Faith (j = 1) schools, and denote the primary \nphase by t = 2, and the secondary phase by t = 3. Selection into school type in the primary phase is \ndetermined family background and preferences i\u03b7 , with a parameter \u03b4  that takes on positive values: \n( ) ( )2 2Pr 1 Pr 0i ij \u03b4\u03b7 \u03c5= = \u2212 >               (A2) \nWhere 2i\u03c5  is a finite variance, random shock that is uncorrelated with i\u03b7  or 2i\u03b5 , and affects \nchoice over school type. At the secondary stage, we assume that i\u03b7  remains the dominant factor \ndetermining Faith school choice. However, families may also take into account the quality of the \nmatch between the child and the sector in the primary stage as represented by 2i\u03b5 , with a low \nrealisation of 2i\u03b5  inducing families to switch school types. Further, Faith secondary schools may \nengage in covert selection that favours children from the Faith primary sector, which we model as a \ndifferential \u2018switching\u2019 threshold for children from the Faith as opposed to children from the Secular \nsector. These considerations imply the following selection probabilities at the secondary stage: \n)0Pr()0|1Pr( 3223 >\u2212\u2212\u2212=== \u03c4\u03c5\u03c3\u03b5\u03b4\u03b7 iiijj           (A3) \n3 2 2 3Pr( 1| 1) Pr( 0)i i ij j \u03b4\u03b7 \u03c3\u03b5 \u03c5 \u03c4= = = + \u2212 + >  \nIn these expressions 3i\u03c5  is another shock\n19\n uncorrelated with i\u03b7  or 2i\u03b5 , and \u03c3  is a parameter \nrepresenting the strength of (self-) selection on the revealed sector-pupil match. Note that 2i\u03c3\u03b5  enters \n                                                 \n19\n This might include random events such as unforeseen home moves, emerging travel constraints, changes in preferences, \nunexpected changes to school capacity (limiting place availability), or changes to aspects of teaching practices of a given \nsector that are uncorrelated with KS2 achievements (e.g. too much or too little religious education). \n 37 \ninto the selection equations for Secular primary pupils with the opposite sign to Faith primary pupils, \nbecause a revealed high quality match (high 2i\u03b5 ) discourages switching to the Faith sector. Finally, \n\u03c4\u00b1  is a selection threshold above which Faith secondary schools admit pupils, with preference for \nFaith primary pupils (threshold \u03c4\u2212 ) against Secular primary students (threshold \u03c4 ). In reality, in the \nEnglish institutional context, both \u03c3  and \u03c4  are likely to negligible (see discussion in Section 4.3), but \nwe introduce them here in order to consider their potential implications. In particular, there is little \nrationale for switching on 2i\u03b5  because families cannot observe the counterfactual match in the sector \nthey did not attend, and the transition from primary to secondary school involves leaving the school \nthat disappointed them in any case. \nOLS estimation of the school-type effect 2j\u03b2  in Equation (A1) is biased, with the bias in the \nestimate of 0212 \u03b2\u03b2 \u2212  in the population determined by: \n2 2 2 2[ | ] [ | ] 0i i i i i i i iE E\u03b7 \u03b5 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03c5 \u03b7 \u03b5 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03c5 \u00b5+ > \u2212 + \u2264 = >          (A4) \nHowever, we argue that the Faith-Secular primary school comparison within various secondary \nschool groups is informative about the size of this bias, and that some within-group comparisons \nprovide less biased estimates. Specifically, the comparisons we consider and the associated biases are:  \n\u2022 Within Faith secondary schools :- \n2 2 2 3 2 2 2 3[ | , ] [ | , ]i i i i i i i i i i i i i iE E\u03b7 \u03b5 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03c5 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03c3\u03b5 \u03c4 \u03c5 \u03b7 \u03b5 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03c5 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03c3\u03b5 \u03c4 \u03c5+ > + + > \u2212 + \u2264 \u2212 \u2212 >     (A5) \n\u2022 Within Secular secondary schools :- \n2 2 2 3 2 2 2 3[ | , ] [ | , ]i i i i i i i i i i i i i iE E\u03b7 \u03b5 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03c5 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03c3\u03b5 \u03c4 \u03c5 \u03b7 \u03b5 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03c5 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03c3\u03b5 \u03c4 \u03c5+ > + + \u2264 \u2212 + \u2264 \u2212 \u2212 \u2264     (A6) \n\u2022 Within-switchers:- \n2 2 2 3 2 2 2 3[ | , ] [ | , ]i i i i i i i i i i i i i iE E\u03b7 \u03b5 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03c5 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03c3\u03b5 \u03c4 \u03c5 \u03b7 \u03b5 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03c5 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03c3\u03b5 \u03c4 \u03c5+ > + + \u2264 \u2212 + \u2264 \u2212 \u2212 >     (A7) \n\u2022 Within-stayers:- \n2 2 2 3 2 2 2 3[ | , ] [ | , ]i i i i i i i i i i i i i iE E\u03b7 \u03b5 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03c5 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03c3\u03b5 \u03c4 \u03c5 \u03b7 \u03b5 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03c5 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03c3\u03b5 \u03c4 \u03c5+ > + + > \u2212 + \u2264 \u2212 \u2212 \u2264     (A8) \nOur main claims regarding the bias in the estimate of the impact of attending a Faith primary \nschool for these groups are made on the basis of empirical observations on the degree of sorting along \n 38 \nthe lines of family background within these groups in conjunction with our knowledge of current \nEnglish educational context. However, it is worth highlighting some theoretical considerations which \nsupport our claims. \n6.2. Analytical results when \u03c3  and \u03c4  are equal to zero \nAssume first that \u03c3  and \u03c4  are zero \u2013 or small relative to the selection on i\u03b7 . In this case, the bias \nterms in (A5) and (A6) are likely to be less than or equal to the bias in the population (A4), whereas \n(A7) is unbiased and (A8) is upward biased.  \nTo see this, consider first (A7). Assuming it\u03c5  are random variables with identical distributions, \nthe selection process on i\u03b7  at both phases is identical in the Faith-Secular group and the Secular-Faith \ngroup (just in a different order), and the bias in (A7) is zero, i.e.: \n[ ] [ ]2 3 2 3| 1, 0 | 0, 1i i i i i iE j j E j j\u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b7= = = = =           (A9) \nIn contrast, the stayers\u2019 group comparison (A8) yields an upward biased estimate, given that the \nFaith-Faith stayers are those for whom i\u03b7  is sufficiently high such that 2i i\u03b4\u03b7 \u03c5> and 3i i\u03b4\u03b7 \u03c5> , \nwhereas the Secular-Secular stayers are those for whom i\u03b7  is sufficiently low so that both 2i i\u03b4\u03b7 \u03c5\u2264  \nand 3i i\u03b4\u03b7 \u03c5\u2264 .The within-Faith-secondary and within-Faith-primary biases are harder to determine in \nthe general case, but our conjecture is that they will generally be less than the population bias \u00b5  in \n(A4), and this can be shown by simulation.  \nFor one analytical example, consider the symmetric case when: (i) the probability p>0.5 of \nattending a Faith secondary school, conditional on attending a Faith primary school, equals the \nprobability of attending a Secular secondary school, conditional on attending a Secular primary \nschool; and (ii) the within-Faith-secondary and within-Faith-primary biases are equal, i.e.: \n[ ] [ ]{ }\n[ ] [ ]{ }\n2 3 2 3\n2 3 2 3\n| 1, 1 | 0, 1\n| 1, 0 | 0, 0\ni i i i i i\ni i i i i i\nE j j E j j\nE j j E j j\n\u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b7\n\u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b7\n= = \u2212 = =\n= = = \u2212 = =\n         (A10) \nIn this case: \n 39 \n[ ] [ ]\n[ ] [ ]{ }\n( ) [ ] [ ]{ }\n2 2\n2 3 2 3\n2 3 2 3\n| 1 | 0\n| 1, 1 | 0, 0\n1 | 1, 0 | 0, 1\ni i i i\ni i i i i i\ni i i i i i\nE j E j\np E j j E j j\np E j j E j j\n\u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b7\n\u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b7\n\u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b7\n= \u2212 =\n= = = \u2212 = =\n+ \u2212 = = \u2212 = =\n        (A11) \nNote also that, given (A9): \n[ ] [ ]{ }\n[ ] [ ]{ }\n[ ] [ ]{ }\n2 3 2 3\n2 3 2 3\n2 3 2 3\n| 1, 1 | 0, 0\n| 1, 1 | 0, 1\n| 1, 0 | 0, 0\ni i i i i i\ni i i i i i\ni i i i i i\nE j j E j j\nE j j E j j\nE j j E j j\n\u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b7\n\u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b7\n\u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b7\n= = \u2212 = =\n= = = \u2212 = =\n+ = = \u2212 = =\n         (A12) \nFrom (A11) and (A12), and using (A4), (A9) and (A10) it follows that the within-Secular-\nsecondary bias and the within-Faith-secondary bias are equal to: \n[ ] [ ]{ }\n[ ] [ ]{ }\n2 3 2 3\n2 3 2 3\n| 1, 0 | 0, 0\n| 1, 1 | 0, 1\n2\ni i i i i i\ni i i i i i\nE j j E j j\nE j j E j j\np\n\u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b7\n\u00b5\u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b7\n= = \u2212 = = =\n= = \u2212 = = =\n         (A13) \nGiven the assumption p>0.5, the within-secondary bias is less than that in the population (A4). \nFurther insights can be gained by looking at the effects of truncating the distributions of i\u03b4\u03b7  for \npupils originating in Faith primaries, ( )2| 1i if j\u03b4\u03b7 = , and in Secular primaries, ( )2| 0i if j\u03b4\u03b7 = , \nassuming these distributions are of similar shape and variance, but mean-shifted with \n[ ] [ ]2 2| 1 | 0 0i i i iE j E j\u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b7 \u00b5= \u2212 = = > . For simplicity of notation, assume that [ ]2| 0 0i iE j\u03b4\u03b7 = =  \nand consider that for any realisation of 3i\u03c5  we have:  \n[ ] [ ]2 3 2 3| 1, | 0,i i i i i i i iE j E j\u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03c5 \u00b5 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03c5 \u00b5= > = + = > \u2212        (A14) \n[ ] [ ]2 3 2 3| 1, | 0,i i i i i i i iE j E j\u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03c5 \u00b5 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03c5 \u00b5= \u2264 = + = \u2264 \u2212        (A15) \nTherefore, for given 3i\u03c5 , the biases are as follows: \n\u2022 Within-Faith-secondary :- \n[ ] [ ]2 3 2 30 | 0, | 0,i i i i i i i iE j E j\u00b5 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03c5 \u00b5 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03c5 \u00b5\u2264 + = > \u2212 \u2212 = > \u2264       (A16) \n\u2022 Within-Secular-secondary :- \n[ ] [ ]2 3 2 30 | 0, | 0,i i i i i i i iE j E j\u00b5 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03c5 \u00b5 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03c5 \u00b5\u2264 + = \u2264 \u2212 \u2212 = \u2264 \u2264      (A17) \n \n 40 \n\u2022 Within-switchers :- \n[ ] [ ]2 3 2 3| 0, | 0, 0i i i i i i i iE j E j\u00b5 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03c5 \u00b5 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03c5+ = \u2264 \u2212 \u2212 = > <       (A18) \n\u2022 Within-stayers :- \n[ ] [ ]2 3 2 3| 0, | 0,i i i i i i i iE j E j\u00b5 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03c5 \u00b5 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03c5 \u00b5+ = > \u2212 \u2212 = \u2264 >       (A19) \nNote that (A16) and (A17) follow because the difference between the second two terms is less \nthan zero, but greater than \u00b5\u2212 . Also, (A18) holds because the difference between the second two \nterms is less than \u00b5\u2212 , and (A19) holds because the difference between the second two terms is \ngreater than zero. \nThe assumption that the distributions ( ) ( )2 2| 1 , | 0i i i if j f j\u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b7= =  differ only in their means \nfollows from (A2) (assuming [ ]2 0iE \u03c5 = ). However, in our empirical work, only 30% of pupils are \nenrolled in the Faith primary sector so it might be argued that the two distributions differ in their \nvariance, with [ ] [ ]2 2| 0 | 1i i i iVar j Var j\u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b7= > = . This difference in variance reduces the bias \nimplied by (A16) and increases the bias implied by (A17). Assuming for simplicity that 0\u00b5 = , then: \n[ ] [ ]2 3 2 3| 1, | 0, 0i i i i i i i iE j E j\u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03c5 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03c5= > \u2212 = > <   if [ ] [ ]2 2| 0 | 1i i i iVar j Var j\u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b7= > =\n  \n (A20) \n[ ] [ ]2 3 2 3| 1, | 0, 0i i i i i i i iE j E j\u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03c5 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03c5= \u2264 \u2212 = \u2264 >   if [ ] [ ]2 2| 0 | 1i i i iVar j Var j\u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b7= > =     (A21) \nClearly there is no way to determine the precise outcome of the within-secondary-school \ncomparison without making specific distributional assumptions, although under the hypothesis \nspecified here above, the potential biases in the within-Faith (A20) and within-Secular (A21) \ncomparisons tend to cancel out. \nOn the other hand, even with [ ] [ ]2 2| 0 | 1i i i iVar j Var j\u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b7= > = , the switchers\u2019 comparison in \n(A18) remains downward biased (for given 3i\u03c5 ) because [ ]2 3| 0,i i i iE j\u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03c5= >  increases with \n[ ]2| 0i iVar j\u03b4\u03b7 =\n \nand [ ]2 3| 1,i i i iE j\u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03c5 \u00b5= \u2264 \u2212  decreases with [ ]2| 1i iVar j\u03b4\u03b7 = . Similarly, the \nupward bias in the stayers\u2019 comparison (A19) also holds because [ ]2 3| 0,i i i iE j\u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03c5= \u2264  decreases \nwith [ ]2| 0i iVar j\u03b4\u03b7 =  and [ ]2 3| 1,i i i iE j\u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03c5 \u00b5= > \u2212  increases with [ ]2| 1i iVar j\u03b4\u03b7 = .  \n 41 \nAs it turns out, comparing the Faith-primary and Secular-primary sectors, we find similar \nstandard deviations of the ks2 test scores in the two school types (s.d.=26.17 and 26.66, respectively). \nSimilarly, we find negligible differences across the two groups when we look at ks2 predictions based \non a regression of test scores on pupil and family characteristics (s.d.=21.01 and 21.26), as well as \nwhen focussing on the residuals from this regression (s.d.= 15.80 and 16.10). This suggests that the \nequal variance assumption that underlies the expressions for the biases in (A16) to (A19) may be quite \nreasonable in practice. \n6.3. Analytical results with \u03c3  and \u03c4  different from zero \nNote however that if \u03c3  and \u03c4  are non-zero, the bias from the within-secondary-school-type \ncomparisons (A5) and (A6) could be larger or smaller than the bias from the Faith-Secular primary \nschool comparison in the population in (A4). \nTo begin with, consider the case when 0\u03c3 >\n \n(and 0\u03c4 = ). The within-Faith-secondary-schools \nestimator now compares very-high i\u03b4\u03b7 \/high 2i\u03c3\u03b5\n \npupils from Faith primaries with mid-range i\u03b4\u03b7 \/low \n2i\u03c3\u03b5  pupils from Secular primaries so the bias is positive. The within-Secular-secondary school \nestimator compares mid-range i\u03b4\u03b7 \/low 2i\u03c3\u03b5  pupils from Faith primaries with very-low i\u03b4\u03b7 \/high 2i\u03c3\u03b5  \nfrom Secular primaries, so the bias is ambiguous. On the other hand, the within-switchers\u2019 estimator \ncompares mid-range i\u03b4\u03b7 \/low- 2i\u03b5  Faith-Secular switchers with mid-range i\u03b4\u03b7 \/low- 2i\u03b5  Secular-Faith \nswitchers, while the within-stayers estimator compares very high i\u03b4\u03b7 \/high 2i\u03c3\u03b5\n \nFaith-Faith stayers \nwith very low i\u03b4\u03b7 \/high 2i\u03b5  Secular-Secular stayers. Therefore the within-switchers comparison is still \nless biased, and the within-stayers comparison more biased than the population comparison in (A4). \nConsider finally the case when 0\u03c4 >\n \n(and 0\u03c3 = ). The within-secondary biases implied by (A5) \nand (A6) are attenuated, because 0\u03c4 >  implies that Faith primary pupils have relatively low i\u03b4\u03b7  when \ncompared with their Secular primary counterparts in the same secondary school type. However, for \nthe within-switchers estimate, the additional truncation from \u03c4  implies a further downward bias, \n 42 \nwhile the within-stayers estimate is further upward biased. This can be seen easily (ignoring 3i\u03c5 ) in \nthe case when ( ) ( )2 2| 1 , | 0i i i if j f j\u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b7= =\n \nhave similar shapes, but are mean-shifted: \n\u2022 Within-switchers :- \n[ ] [ ]\n[ ] [ ]\n2 2\n2 2\n| 1, | 0,\n| 0, | 0, 0\ni i i i i i\ni i i i i i\nE j E j\nE j E j\n\u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03c4 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03c4\n\u00b5 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03c4 \u00b5 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03c4\n= \u2264 \u2212 \u2212 = >\n= + = \u2264 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 = > <\n      (A22) \n\u2022 Within-stayers :- \n[ ] [ ]\n[ ] [ ]\n2 2\n2 2\n| 1, | 0,\n| 0, | 0,\ni i i i i i\ni i i i i i\nE j E j\nE j E j\n\u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03c4 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03c4\n\u00b5 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03c4 \u00b5 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03c4 \u00b5\n= > \u2212 \u2212 = \u2264 =\n+ = > \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 = \u2264 >\n        (A23) \nWhere (A22) holds because [ ] [ ]2 2| 0, | 0,i i i i i ij E j\u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03c4 \u00b5 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b7 \u03c4 \u00b5= \u2264 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 = > < \u2212 , and (A23) \nholds because the mean of a left truncated distribution can never be less than the mean in the same \ndistribution when right truncated. \nIn summary, whilst the within-secondary comparison provides ambiguous biases, the direction of \nthe biases in the within-switchers and within-stayers comparisons are unambiguous. The comparison \nof Faith-Secular switchers with Secular-Faith switchers is never \u2013 under any of these assumptions \u2013 \nmore upward biased than the estimate based on comparing Faith primary with Secular primary pupils \nin the population, and is under the most likely scenarios either downward biased or unbiased. The \ncomparison of Faith-Faith stayers with Secular-Secular stayers instead is always upward biased. These \narguments underlie our claims that: (i) the stayers\u2019 comparison provides an upper bound to the effect \nof Faith primary schooling; and (ii) that by focussing on the group of switchers, we either estimate a \nlower bound to the causal effect of attending a Faith primary school or a close-to-unbiased estimate of \nthis effect. The results in Section 5 suggest the latter is the most likely scenario. \nOf course, if ( ) ( )2 2| 1 , | 0i i i if j f j\u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b7= =  have completely different shapes, it will be hard to \nprove anything definite about the biases induced by the within-secondary or the switchers\/stayers \ncomparisons. However, it is hard to imagine likely scenarios where this outcome could arise given the \ncontext in which we apply our analysis, and given that the evidence provided in the paper supports the \nassumptions and intuitions discussed here above. \n 43 \nNevertheless, we have carried out various simulations which further convince us that the \nconjectures described above hold under very general scenarios. In Figure A1, we report the findings \nfrom one of these exercises diagrammatically using simulations of the distributions of 2ii \u03b5\u03b7 +  under \nsome of the conditions described above. In the graphs, we assume i\u03b7 , 2i\u03b5 , 2i\u03c5 and 3i\u03c5  to be normally \ndistributed, with 25.0)var()var()var(,1)var( 322 ==== iiii \u03c5\u03c5\u03b5\u03b7 . The first panel illustrates the case \nwhere all selection into Faith schools is based on family\/pupil background ( 1, 0\u03b4 \u03c3 \u03c4= = = ). By \nconstruction, the difference in mean 2ii \u03b5\u03b7 +  between the Faith primary and Secular primary \ndistributions is 1.4. However, the difference in mean unobservables 2ii \u03b5\u03b7 +  between the Faith-Faith \nand Secular-Secular stayers is larger than this, while the difference in mean unobsevables between the \nFaith-Secular and Secular-Faith switchers is zero. Next, in the central panel we allow for covert \nselection at the secondary level in favour of Faith primary pupils by setting 0.5\u03c4 = . As a \nconsequence, the distributions in Faith secondary schooling are shifted leftwards and the distributions \nin Secular schooling are shifted rightwards, such that the switchers\u2019 comparison becomes downward \nbiased (mean 2ii \u03b5\u03b7 +  in the Secular-Faith group is above that in the Faith-Secular group) providing a \nlower bound estimate, while the stayers\u2019 comparison remains upward biased. The last panel adds in \nselection by 2i\u03b5  by setting 1\u03c3 =  (plus the other assumptions as above). This shifts the stayers\u2019 \ndistributions rightwards, because students with high 2i\u03b5  stay in the same sector, whereas the \nswitchers\u2019 distributions shift leftwards. Nevertheless, the stayers\u2019 comparison remains upward biased, \nwhile the bias in the switchers\u2019 sample is small under reasonable assumptions, and always less than \nthat in the population. \n 44 \n \n \nFigure A1: Diagrammatic illustration of distributions of 2ii \u03b5\u03b7 +  arising from the switching process \nFaith and secular primary pupils in Faith and Secular secondary schools: selection based on family background\/preferences only \n \n...plus differential selection into Faith secondary schools in favour of Faith primary pupils \n \n... plus self-selection into secondary type based on primary-type match quality  \n \n \n \n 45 \nAppendix B: Calibrating selection on unobservables to selection on observables \nIn this appendix section we describe our implementation of the Altonji et al. (2005b) methodology. In \nour case, the outcome of interest is a continuous indicator (test scores), rather than a binary variable, \nand we want to investigate: (a) how much positive selection on unobservables we need in order to \ndrive our estimates to zero; and (b) how robust our estimates are to the assumption of an equal amount \nof selection on observables and unobservables. Note that this exercise is carried out first on all pupils \nin the sample, and then separately for the groups of stayers and switchers. \nThe foundation of this analysis is a Heckman-type selection model of the form:  \n2 2 1 2\n2 1 1\n' ( )\n( ' ( ) 0)\ni j i i i\nij i i i\nks x g ks\nd I x h ks\n\u03b2 \u03b3 \u03be\n\u03bb \u03d1\n= + + +\n= + + >\n             (B1) \nIn which 2ijd  indicates Faith-primary school attendance at Key Stage 2\n20; (.)I is an indicator \nfunction taking value one if its argument is above zero; and the error terms 2i\u03be and 1i\u03d1 are jointly \nnormally distributed with: 0)E( i2 =\u03be , 2i2 )Var( \u03c3\u03be = , 0)E( i1 =\u03d1 , 1)Var( i1 =\u03d1  and \u03c1\u03d1\u03be =),Corr( 1i2 i . \nThe parameter \u03c1  measures the correlation between unobservables in the Faith school selection \nequation and in the value-added equation. Stated differently, this parameter captures the degree to \nwhich unobserved family\/pupil characteristics i\u03b7  in equation (1) (in the main text) influence selection \ninto Faith schooling. For both the objectives (a) and (b) here above, we are interested in assessing how \nestimates of 2j\u03b2  change as we restrict the parameter \u03c1  to different values.  \nAs shown by Heckman (1979), the model in (B1) can be estimated by maximum likelihood or \nusing a two-step method. The two-step method first estimates the probability of attending a Faith \nschool ( 2 1)ijd =  parametrically using a probit model 2 1 1Pr( 1| , ) ( ' ( ))ij i i i id x ks x h ks\u03bb= = \u03a6 + , and then \nestimates the following equation: \n                                                 \n20\n In the empirical work we restrict attention to attendance at Faith-autonomous primary schools. \n 46 \n2 2 1 2\n1\n1\n' ( ) *\n\u02c6\u02c6( ' ( ))\n\u02c6\u02c6( ' ( ))\ni j i i i i\ni i\ni\ni i\nks x g ks MillsRatio\nx h ksMillsRatio\nx h ks\n\u03b2 \u03b3 \u03b8 \u03c2\n\u03d5 \u03bb\n\u03bb\n= + + + +\n+\n=\n\u03a6 +\n         (B2) \nWhere 2i\u03c2  is a new error term, (.)\u03c6  indicates the normal density distribution, (.)\u03a6  represents the \nnormal cumulative distribution, \u03bb\u02c6  and \u02c6(.)h  are estimated using the probit first-stage and \u03c3\u03c1\u03b8 = . The \nparameter \u03c1  is only parametrically identified without exclusion restrictions on \u03b3  (i.e. non-parametric \nidentification requires a valid instrument for selection). However, \u03c1  can be constrained to predefined \nvalues in the estimation of system (B2) by imposing a constraint on \u03c3\u03c1\u03b8 =  once an estimate for \u03c3  is \nobtained (and maintained as \u03c1  changes). We obtain this estimate of \u03c3  from unconstrained version of \nsystem (B2), where parametric identification is achieved exploiting the non-linearities in the Mills \nratio. By setting \u03c1  to different values, we can explore the sensitivity of 2\u02c6 j\u03b2  to different assumptions \nabout the degree of selection on unobservables into Faith schooling and find the value of \u03c1  that is \nnecessary to drive estimates of 2\u02c6 j\u03b2  to zero. This allows us to answer question (a) spelled out above.  \nAdditionally, Altonji et al. (2005b) discuss how to use this set-up to identify the value of \u03c1  \nwhich implies an equal amount of selection on observables and unobservables. They argue that, if a \nlarge number of observable characteristics are available for the investigation, the extent of selection \non observables provides an upper bound for the amount selection on unobservables. To see how this \napplies to our case, consider the latent variable 2 1 1* ' ( )ij i i id x h ks\u03bb \u03d1= + +  and assume we could run the \nfollowing \u2018thought\u2019 regression: \n2 0 1 1 2 2\u02c6 \u02c6* [ ( )]ij i i id x g ks\u03b4 \u03b4 \u03b3 \u03b4 \u03be\u2032= + + +             (B3) \nIn the Altonij et al. (2005b) sense, equal selection on observables and unobservables is obtained \nwhen 21 \u03b4\u03b4 = . Note now that in our case, where the outcome is a continuous variable and the term \n2i\u03be does not have unit variance, we have that: \n 47 \n\u03c3\n\u03c1\n\u03be\n\u03be\u03d1\u03b4\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\u03bb\u03b4\n==\n+\n++\n=\n)(\n),(\n))(\u02c6\u02c6'(\n))(\u02c6\u02c6'),(\u02c6\u02c6'(\n2\n21\n2\n1\n11\n1\ni\nii\nii\niijii\nVar\nCov\nksgxVar\nksgxkshxCov\n           (B4) \nThe constraint 21 \u03b4\u03b4 =  is therefore equivalent to the constraint 1\/ \u03b4\u03c3\u03c1 =  or 12\u03b4\u03c3\u03c3\u03c1 = . Hence, in \nthe estimation of system (B2), \u2018selection on observables equals selection on unobservables\u2019 implies \nthe following constraint: \n))(\u02c6\u02c6'(\n))(\u02c6\u02c6'),(\u02c6\u02c6'(\n1\n112\nii\niijiiES\nksgxVar\nksgxkshxCov\n+\n++\n=\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\u03bb\n\u03c3\u03b8           (B5) \nWhere the superscript ES denotes \u2018equal selection\u2019. Note that we do not estimate ES\u03b8  and all the \nparameters in equation (B1) simultaneously subject to the constraint (B5). Rather we use an iterative \ngrid-search numerical method to estimate ES\u03b8  that operates as follows: \n(i) Estimate the first-stage probit model in the two-step Heckman system in (B2). \n(ii) Estimate the second-stage of the Heckman selection model imposing a chosen value of \n*\nr\n\u03b8 \u03b8= . \n(iii) Calculate \u02c6\nr\n\u03c1 = ))(\u02c6\u02c6'(\n))(\u02c6\u02c6'),(\u02c6\u02c6'(\n\u02c6\n1\n11\nii\niijii\nksgxVar\nksgxkshxCov\n+\n++\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\u03bb\n\u03c3\n from the estimated parameters in steps (i) \nand (ii). \n(iv) Repeat (ii) and (iii) for pre-defined, incrementally different values of *\nr\n\u03b8 . \n(v) Plot the values \u02c6\nr\n\u03c1  thus obtained against the values of * \u02c6\nr\n\u03b8 \u03c3 . As already mentioned, an \nestimate of the parameter \u03c3  is obtained from the unconstrained model and assumed \nconstant, so changing values of *\nr\n\u03b8 can be mapped into corresponding values for \u02c6\nr\n\u03c1 . \n(vi) Find the point where \u02c6\nr\n\u03c1 = * \u02c6\nr\n\u03b8 \u03c3  (i.e. the intersection of the plot in (v) with the 45-degree \nline) within a predefined tolerance (0.0005). This can be achieved by progressively \ndecreasing the size of the increments in step (iv). The point where \u02c6\nr\n\u03c1 = * \u02c6\nr\n\u03b8 \u03c3  is the point at \n 48 \nwhich the amount of selection on observables is equal to the amount of selection on \nunobservables. \nAs discussed in Altonji et al. (2005b), the point at which selection on observables is as sizeable as \nselection on unobservables identifies an upper bound for the amount of selection on unobservables \nthat one should expect provided that: (a) a sufficient number of controls can be included in the \nempirical models; (b) these controls can account for a substantial amount of the variation in the \noutcomes (as captured by the R-squared\u2019s of the models); (c) the set of controls is sufficiently broad to \ncapture most of the factors that determine the outcomes. It follows that estimates of the impact of \nattending a Faith school where we impose an equal amount of selection on observables and \nunobservables provide a lower bound to what the effect of attending a religious school would be in the \nabsence of sorting on unobservables. This helps us establishing how robust our estimates are to the \n\u2018most conservative\u2019 assumptions about sorting based on unobservables, and answers our question (b) \nset out above. \n \n 49 \n \n \nTable 1: Institutional characteristics of primary schools in England \nType Faith Governors (approximately) Admissions \nauthority \nAssets owned \nby \nEmployer \nCommunity Secular Parents >30%, Staff <30%, LEA \n20%, Community 20% \nLEA LEA LEA \nFoundation Mostly Secular, \nsome C. of E., \nParents >30%, Staff <30%, \nFoundation\/Partnership <25%, LEA \n<20%, Community 10% \nGovernors Foundation or \nGovernors  \nGovernors \nVoluntary \nAided \nMostly C. of E. or \nCatholic, some other Faith, \nsome Secular \nFoundation >50%, Parents >30%, \nLEA <10%, Staff <30% \nGovernors Foundation Governors \nVoluntary \nControlled \nMostly C. of E., some \nother Faith, some Secular \nParents >30%, Staff <30%,  \nFoundation <25%, LEA <20%, \nCommunity 10% \nLEA LEA LEA \nNote: C. of E. means Church of England. \n \n 50 \n \nTable 2: Ks2 (age-11) achievement by school type; descriptive statistics \nVariable Mean Std.Dev.
