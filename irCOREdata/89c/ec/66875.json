J.  LOWE\nAt one time, it was popular to argue against interactionist dualism\nby appeal to the conservation laws of physics, such as the laws of the\nconservation of energy and momentum. However, those laws are\nnot sacrosanct and there need be nothing unscientific about ques-\ntioning them\u2014indeed they have been questioned from time to time\nby cosmologists and other physicists. Think, for instance, of Bondi\nand Gold\u2019s steady-state model of the universe, which postulated the\ncontinuous creation of matter and hence of energy.1 In an y case,\nappeal to those laws can at best only be used to attack dualist mod-\nels of psychophysical causation which attribute to the non-physical\nmind an ability to affect the energy or momentum of a physical sys-\ntem. I say \u2018at best\u2019 because some interactionist dualists, such as W.\nD. Hart, have postulated the existence of \u2018psychic energy\u2019, which is\nconvertible into physical energy in accordance with the conservation\nlaws.2 It w on\u2019t do simply to object that energy is by definition a\nphysical quantity, as this threatens to turn the dispute into a purely\nverbal one. In view of these and other limitations, it would serve\nphysicalists well if they could frame a more general argument\nagainst interactionist dualism, which did not make specific appeal to\nthe conservation laws.3 Man y modern physicalists think that they\nhave an argument of just this sort to hand, in the form of the causal\nclosure argument.4\nIn fact, this is not so much a single argument as a family of argu-\nments. A \u2018causal closure argument\u2019, as I shall be interpreting that\nPhilosophy 75 2000 571\n1See H. Bondi, Cosmology, 2nd edn (Cambridge University Press,\n1961), Ch. XII. \n2See W. D. Hart, The Engines of the Soul (Cambridge University Press,\n1988), Ch. 9.\n3F or further discussion of the (ir)relevance of physical conservation\nlaws to the problem of psychophysical causation, see my Subjects of\nExperience (Cambridge University Press, 1996), pp. 56\u201363. \n4 A r elatively early version of this form of argument may be found in\nChristopher Peacocke, Holistic Explanation: Action, Space, Interpretation\n(Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1979), pp. 134\u201343, though Peacocke\u2019s version\ndoes not exactly conform to the pattern I specify below. I raise an objec-\ntion to Peacocke\u2019s argument in my \u2018Against an Argument for Token\nIdentity\u2019, Mind 90 (1981), pp. 120\u20131.\nphrase, has three premises: first, a physical causal closure principle;\nsecond, the claim\u2014to which interactionist dualists are themselves\ncommitted\u2014that at least some mental events are causes of physical\nevents; and third, the claim that the physical effects of mental caus-\nes are not, in general, causally overdetermined.5 T he conclusion of\nsuch an argument is that at least some mental events are identical\nwith physical events. Incidentally, I am assuming for the time being\nthat the relata of causal relations are events, broadly conceived to\ninclude both processes and states, but not too much turns on this\nassumption at the moment. Later on, however, I shall introduce a\ndistinction between event-causation and fact-causation which may\nhave a significant bearing on the issues under discussion.6\nAs we shall see shortly, physicalists espousing causal closure argu-\nments do not always agree on the way to formulate their causal clo-\nsure principles. What is crucial to the success of such an argument\nis that the causal closure principle appealed to should be neither too\nstrong nor too weak. If the principle is so strong, for instance, as to\nrender redundant the third premise of the argument\u2014the non-\noverdetermination claim\u2014then the argument will become simply\nquestion-begging, because it will amount to an argument from two\npremises, one of which is accepted by the dualist, to a conclusion\nwhich is not accepted by the dualist: and in these circumstances the\ndualist may justly urge that his opponent is, in effect, merely assert-\ning what he is denying. Moreover, to have any persuasive force, the\ncausal closure principle must be one for which some measure of\nempirical support can plausibly be mustered, and this places limits\non how strong it can be. On the other hand, the causal closure prin-\nciple must, obviously, not be so weak that the argument in which it\nis deployed turns out to be invalid. What I shall try to show in this\npaper is that it is in fact very difficult, if not impossible, for the\nphysicalist to formulate a causal closure principle which is neither\ntoo strong nor too weak by these standards. In particular, I shall\nargue that there are various forms of naturalistic dualism, of an\nemergentist character, which are perfectly consistent with the\nE. J. Lowe\n572\n5 W hy should systematic causal overdetermination be ruled out where\npsychophysical causation is concerned? Perhaps it shouldn\u2019t be, and this\nwould be a quick way to dispose of causal closure arguments: see further\nEugene Mills, \u2018Interactionism and Ove rd e t e r m i n a t i o n\u2019, A m e r i c a n\nPhilosophical Quarterly 33 (1996), pp. 105\u201317. But I take it that most inter-\nactionist dualists would not wish to resort to this strategy if possible, as it\nlooks suspiciously ad hoc.\n6 For more on the distinction between event-causation and fact-causa-\ntion, see Jonathan Bennett, Events and their Names (Oxford: Clarendon\nPress, 1988), pp. 21ff.\nstrongest physical causal closure principles that can plausibly be\nadvocated. If that is correct, then it means that causal closure argu-\nments against interactionist dualism do not, after all, provide a\nsuperior alternative to the discredited arguments which appeal to\nthe conservation laws of physics.\nI mentioned a moment ago the variety of causal closure principles\nappealed to by physicalists. Let me briefly illustrate this variety by\nsome examples. In a recent paper, David Papineau appeals to the\nfollowing principle, which he calls the principle of \u2018the complete-\nness of physics\u2019:7\n(1A) All physical effects have sufficient physical causes.\nBut in an earlier book, he appeals instead to a somewhat different\nprinciple, which he calls by the same title, namely:8\n(1B) All physical effects have complete physical causes.\nPapineau explains that by \u2018complete\u2019 here he means \u2018\u201ccomplete\u201d in\nthe sense that those causes on their own suffice by physical law to\nfix the chances of those effects\u2019. However, he does also advert to the\nlatter formulation in a footnote to the more recent paper, remarking\nthat \u2018a stricter version ... would say that the chances of physical\neffects are always fixed by sufficient physical causes\u2019.9\nIn another recent contribution to the literature on causal closure,\nScott Sturgeon states what he too calls the principle of the com-\npleteness of physics as follows:10\n(1C) Every physical effect has a fully revealing, purely physical\nhistory.\nHowever, Sturgeon himself glosses this in terms reminiscent of\nPapineau\u2019s, as meaning that \u2018physical effects have their chances fully\ndetermined by physical events alone\u2019. In a paper commenting on\nSturgeon\u2019s, Paul Noordhof seizes upon this gloss, remarking that it\n\u2018seems more perspicuous\u2019 than Sturgeon\u2019s official formulation.11\nCausal Closure Principles and Emer gentism\n573\n7 David Papineau, \u2018Mind the Gap\u2019, in J ames E. Tomberlin (ed.),\nPhilosophical Perspectives, 12: Language, Mind and Ontology (Oxford:\nBlackwell, 1998), pp. 373\u201388: see p. 375.\n8 David Papineau, Philosophical Naturalism (Oxford: Blackwell, 1993),\np. 22.\n9 Papineau, \u2018Mind the Gap\u2019, p. 386, n. 4.\n10 Scott Stur geon, \u2018Physicalism and Overdetermination\u2019, Mind 107\n(1998), pp. 411\u201332: see p. 413.\n1 1  Paul Noord h o f, \u2018The Ove rdetermination Argument ve rsus the\nCause-and-Essence Principle\u2014No Contest\u2019, M i n d  108 (1999), pp.\n367\u201375: see p. 367.\nAccordingly, Noordhof advances the following as his own preferred\nversion of the causal closure principle:\n(1D) Every physical effect has its chance fully determined by\nphysical events alone.\nIt is worth mentioning, however, that in a further gloss on his ver-\nsion of the principle, Sturgeon asserts that \u2018physics does not admit\nthat physical effects have non-physical causes\u2019,12 and this suggests\nyet another formulation, namely:\n(1E) No physical effect has a non-physical cause.\nPretty clearly, principles (1A) to (1E) are not all equivalent to one\nanother, whatever one makes of the various glosses supplied by their\nadvocates. And these by no means exhaust the variety of formula-\ntions to be found in the literature. One might have hoped for more\nexactitude and agreement amongst physicalists when it comes to the\nformulation of a principle so central to their position.\nOne thing we should notice immediately is that the last version\njust cited, (1E), is too strong by the standards laid down earlier,\nbecause it is bound to render redundant the non-overdetermination\npremise of any causal closure argument in which it is deployed. To\nsee this clearly, let me now state explicitly what the remaining\npremises and the conclusion of such an argument are supposed to\nbe. Obviously, these premises and the conclusion are themselves\nsusceptible to some variation in their formulation, but I shall utilize\nwhat I hope can be agreed to be uncontentious versions of them.\nThe second premise, maintaining the existence of psychophysical\ncausation, may be stated thus:\n(2) At least some mental events are causes of physical events.\nThe third premise, excluding the possibility of systematic causal\noverdetermination, may be expressed as follows:\n(3) The physical effects of mental causes are not, in general,\nc a u s a l l y overdetermined. \nAnd the anti-dualist conclusion of the argument is supposed to be\nthis:\n(4) At least some mental events are identical with physical events.\nHowever, it is quite evident that (1E) and (2) together entail (4),\nwithout the help of (3), so that (1E) can fairly be dismissed by the\ninteractionist dualist as question-begging\u2014as I am sure it would be.\nE. J. Lowe\n574\n12 Stur geon, \u2018Physicalism and Overdetermination\u2019, p. 413.\nIn what follows, I am not going to consider probabilistic versions\nof the causal closure principle, such as (1D), because they introduce\ncomplications which are not relevant to the main thrust of what I\nhave to say. Evidently, the chief reason why probabilistic versions\nhave some favour amongst physicalists is that they do not want it to\nbe objected against their argument that it presupposes a determin-\nistic physics which is at odds with modern quantum theory. But\nsince many dualists and physicalists could agree that quantum-level\nphenomena are quite probably irrelevant to the problem of psy-\nchophysical causation, perhaps we can sidestep the complications\nraised by probabilistic causation without unduly oversimplifying\nthe debate. It is true, of course, that some interactionist dualists,\nsuch as Popper and Eccles, have maintained that quantum-level\nphenomena are very much relevant to the problem of psychophysi-\ncal causation, but they are an unrepresentative minority whom we\ncan perhaps afford to ignore for present purposes.13 And, after all,\nif interactionist dualism can be rendered consistent with a deter-\nministic version of the causal closure principle that is not exces-\nsively strong by the standards laid down earlier, it can hardly be\nmore problematic to render it consistent with a probabilistic ver-\nsion. \nWith this restriction in mind, let us look next at a version of the\ncausal closure principle which is very close to Papineau\u2019s version\n(1A) above, namely:\n(1F) Every physical event which has a cause has a sufficient phys-\nical cause.\nHere I should say that I understand a sufficient physical cause of a\ngiven event to be a non-empty set of physical events, each of which\nis a cause of the given event and all of which jointly causally neces-\nsitate the occurrence of the given event. Note that I have included\nthe clause \u2018which has a cause\u2019 in (1F) to allow for the possibility of\nuncaused physical events, such as, perhaps, a putative \u2018first\u2019 physi-\ncal event like the so-called \u2018Big Bang\u2019. \nNow, the trouble with (1F) is that it is too weak by the standards\nlaid down earlier, because it does not serve to entail, when conjoined\nwith premises (2) and (3), the anti-dualist conclusion (4). This, in\nbrief, is because (1F) fails to take into account the transitivity of cau-\nsation. To see this, suppose that a certain non-physical mental event\nMis a cause of a physical event P, such as a certain bodily move-\nment. But suppose also that M itself has a sufficient physical cause.\nThen, clearly, Pmay hav e a sufficient physical cause, in accordance\nCausal Closure Principles and Emer gentism\n575\n13 See , e.g., John C. Eccles, The Evolution of the Brain: Creation of the\nSelf (London: Routledge, 1989), pp. 187\u201392.\nwith principle (1F), namely, a set of p hysical events wh i ch incl u d e s\nthe postulated sufficient physical cause of M. This is perfectly com-\np a t i ble with the non-ove rdetermination pre m i s e, (3), because when a\ns u fficient physical cause of an event P causes P by means, inter alia,\no f causing an intervening event M w h i ch is in turn a cause of P, that\ns u fficient cause and M do not thereby causally ove rdetermine P.\nM o re generally, an interactionist dualist who espouses some ve rs i o n\no f e m e rgentism can happily endorse principle (1F). Such a dualist\nmay consistently maintain that the unive rse has evo l ved (without\n\u2018outside\u2019 influence by supernatural powe rs) from a condition in\nwh i ch only physical events existed to one in wh i ch both physical and\nmental events exist\u2014the latter conceived as non-phy s i c a l \u2014 wh i l e\nalso espousing causal determinism for all eve n t s. On such a view, if\nwe trace back the causal history of e a ch mental event, we eve n t u a l l y\nre a ch a time at wh i ch all of its causal antecedents we re wholly phy s-\nical eve n t s, because on this view it is the physical wh i ch has ulti-\nmately brought the non-physical realm of the mental into being. A\nlittle later on, I shall look in more detail at how psych o p hysical cau-\nsation might operate in a dualistic wo rld go ve rned by principle (1F).\nThe physicalist needs, then, a causal closure principle which is\nstronger that (1F). One likely candidate would be the following,\nwhich seems to avoid the problem created by the transitivity of cau-\nsation:14\n(1G) At every time at which any physical event has a cause, it has\na sufficient physical cause.\nWith (1G) in place, it might seem, we cannot postulate that a phys-\nical event Phas a non-ph ysical cause M existing at a time t1 in addi-\ntion to the sufficient physical cause which, according to (1G), must\nexist at t1, without violating the non-overdetermination premise (3).\nBut in point of fact that is not so, because this neglects the possibil-\nity of simultaneous causation. Suppose that P occurs at t2 and that\nthe postulated sufficient physical cause of P which exists at t1 caus-\nes P in part by means of causing M, which also exists at t1. In that\ncase, P is not causally overdetermined by M and the physical caus-\nes of P that exist at t1. A situation of this sort is illustrated by the\nfollowing diagram, in which an arrow between events represents the\nfact that the event at the tail of the arrow is an immediate cause of\nthe event at the head of the arrow:\nE. J. Lowe\n576\n14 (1G) is v ery near to a version of the causal closure principle advanced\nJaegwon Kim, namely, \u2018Any physical event which has a cause at time t has\na physical cause at t\u2019: see his S u p e r venience and Mind: Selected\nPhilosophical Essays (Cambridge University Press, 1993), p. 280 and, for a\nslightly different wording, p. 360.\nP01 P02 t0\nP11 P12 M t1\nP t2\nFig. 1\nIn the situation depicted in Fig. 1, P has a sufficient physical cause\nat time t1, namely, the set of physical events {P11, P12}. But P also has\nas a cause at t1 the non-physical event M. P is not causally overde-\ntermined by {P11, P12} and M, because it is not the case that in the\nabsence of either one of them P would still have occurred. In par-\nticular, since P is caused by both P11 and P12, if {P11, P12} had been\nabsent, P would not have occurred. Equally, if M had been absent,\nP would not have occurred, for want of a sufficient cause: for we are\nsupposing that {P11, P12} would not have been a sufficient cause of\nP if P12 had not caused P in part by means of M. Of course, the\nphysicalist may well want to deny the possibility of simultaneous\ncausation, but it should be acknowledged that this is a further sub-\nstantive claim, without which the causal closure principle (1G) can-\nnot be used to mount an attack on interactionist dualism.\nH e re I pause to re m a rk that, in his own ve rsion of the causal cl o s u re\na rgument, Christopher Peacocke considers the possibility of a sce-\nnario ve ry similar to the one depicted in Fig. 1, but contends that it is\na l re a dy ruled out by the prohibition on causal ove rd e t e r m i n a t i o n .1 5\nThis is what he says, replacing his labelling of e vents by my own:\nCausal Closure Principles and Emer gentism\n577\n1 5 See Peacock e, Holistic Explanat i o n, pp. 136\u20137. Peacock e \u2019s scenario dif-\nfe rs from that of F i g. 1 in that, in his, P1 2 on its own is a sufficient cause of\nP, but this diffe rence is irre l e vant for present purp o s e s. It must be observe d ,\nh o we ve r, that Peacocke also makes the following assumption about P1 2 and P\n( again replacing his labelling by mine): \u2018[W]e have a complete and wh o l l y\np hysical account of ... the causal route from P1 2 to P in neurophy s i o l o g i c a l\nterms [and] this account completely explains how the event P1 2 causes P\u2019 (p.\n134). Clearl y, this assumption is mu ch stronger than anything that can be\nd e r ived from the causal cl o s u re principle (1G). Indeed, on the most natural\ni n t e rp retation of P e a c o ck e \u2019s assumption it simply rules out by definition the\ns o rt of situation depicted in Fig. 1, because in the latter there is a n o n- p hy s-\nical causal route from P1 2 to P in addition to a physical one. But then one\nwo n d e rs why Peacocke bothered to discuss this sort of situation and object\nto it on the grounds that it invo l ves ove rdetermination. \nEven if P12 causes M, and so it is true ... that if P12 had not\noccurred, then M would not have occurred, the argument stands.\nFor still there is a causal route from M to P, one that evidently\ncannot pass through P12 given the asymmetry of the causation\nrelation; and so overdetermination of P remains the case. The\nfact that it is true that if P12 had not occurred, then M would not\nhave occurred, does not show that there is not overdetermination.\nWe can show this by considering another example. Your pressing\na button to light a bonfire electrically may be a signal to me to put\na lighted match to the bonfire at the same time; then it is true that\nif you had not pressed the button, I would not have put the light-\ned match to the bonfire, but this cannot show that the resulting\nfire was not overdetermined. \nHowever, it is not enough for Peacocke to establish, by means of\nsuch an example, that \u2018The fact that it is true that if P12 had not\noccurred, then M would not have occurred, does not show that there\nis not overdetermination\u2019. Rather, it is incumbent upon him to\nestablish that in the envisaged psychophysical scenario there is\no ve rdetermination. Now, the bonfire example obviously d o e s\ninvolve overdetermination, because your pressing the button would\nhave sufficed to light the bonfire even if it hadn\u2019t caused me to light\nit with a match. But in the situation depicted in Fig. 1, as I am inter-\npreting it, {P11, P12} would not have sufficed to cause P if P12 had not\ncaused M.\nSuppose one were to add to a causal closure argument invoking\nthe causal closure principle (1G) a further premise ruling out simul-\ntaneous causation: would (1G) be strong enough to deliver the anti-\ndualist conclusion (4) in that case? The answer, as we shall see in\ndue course, is that it would not. But before we examine that issue,\nlet us consider whether (1G) is not already too strong by the stan-\ndards laid down earlier. According to those standards, a causal clo-\nsure principle should not be so strong that empirical support for it\ncannot plausibly be mu s t e red. The weaker principle (1F) is cert a i n l y\nnot too strong by these standards, since it is empirically plausible to\nsuppose that the universe contained only physical events at an ear-\nlier epoch and that latterday mental events are the ultimate effects\nof causal chains traceable back to events occurring at that earlier\nepoch. But when we consider that temporal ordering is dense, such\nthat between any two times there is another time, (1G) appears\nunreasonably strong. Suppose that a physical event P, such as a\nbodily movement, is known on good empirical grounds to have a\nsufficient physical cause in a person\u2019s brain at a time 100 millisec-\nonds before the occurrence of P. And suppose it is further postu-\nE. J. Lowe\n578\nlated that that sufficient physical cause causes P in part by causing\nan intermediate mental event M which occurs at a time 90 millisec-\nonds before the occurrence of P. It cannot be illegitimate in princi-\nple to postulate something like this, given that temporal ordering is\ndense, and empirical evidence could quite conceivably support the\nclaim that M occurred at the postulated time. However, principle\n(1G) then requires us to suppose that there is a sufficient physical\ncause of P existing at a time 90 milliseconds before the occurrence\nof P, in advance of any empirical evidence in support of this sup-\nposition. That seems extravagant, especially when we consider that\n(1G) imposes the same requirement with regard to any intervening\ntime between 100 and zero milliseconds before the occurrence of P.\nLet me now return to the weaker causal closure principle (1F)\nand consider how dualistic interaction might operate in a world gov-\nerned by that principle. What I want to suggest is that, in such a\nworld, mental events might serve to render non-coincidental certain\nphysical events which, from a purely physical perspective, might\nappear to occur by coincidence.16 F or present purposes (and sim-\nplifying somewhat for ease of exposition), I take an event to be one\nwhich \u2018occurs by coincidence\u2019 if its immediate causes are the ulti-\nmate effects of independent causal chains. (One complication which\nI shall sidestep is the question of what is to count as an \u2018immediate\ncause\u2019 of a given event, to which different answers might be given\naccording to more or less fine-grained ways of individuating\nevents.) A classic example is this. A man walks to the well from his\nhouse one day, following his usual route, but as he passes by a neigh-\nbour\u2019s house, a gust of wind dislodges a slate which falls on his\nhead, killing him. In this case, the man\u2019s death occurred by coinci-\ndence, because the causal chain leading to his being where he was\nwhen the slate fell was independent of the causal chain leading to\nthe slate\u2019s being where it was when the man passed by. We can eas-\nily imagine, however, another scenario in which the man\u2019s death did\nnot occur by coincidence: for example, a scenario in which a trip-\nwire installed by a jealous neighbour is touched by the approaching\nman, dislodging the slate so that it falls just as he arrives beneath it. \nChanging now to an example involving psychophysical causation,\nsuppose that a physical event P\u2014such as a bodily movement, or a\nneural event which is a direct causal antecedent of such a bodily\nmovement\u2014has as its immediate causes two physical events, P21 and\nP22, occurring at a time t2, and that these physical events are the ulti-\nCausal Closure Principles and Emer gentism\n579\n16 I explor e this proposal in more detail and with a slightly different\nfocus in my \u2018Self, Agency, and Mental Causation\u2019, Journal of Consciousness\nStudies 6 (1999), pp. 225\u201339.\nmate effects of two distinct physical causal chains. From a purely\nphysical perspective, these chains might appear to be independent,\nwith the consequence that P might appear to occur by coincidence.\nBut the truth might be that a mental event M served to link those\ntwo physical causal chains, rendering P non-coincidental\u2014as is\ndepicted in the following diagram:\nP01 P02 t0\nP11 M P12 t1\nP21 P22 t2\nP t3\nFig. 2\nIn the situation depicted in Fig. 2, P has a sufficient physical cause\nat times t0 and t2, namely, {P01, P02} and {P21, P22} respectively, but P\ndoes not have a sufficient physical cause at time t1. This makes the\nsituation consistent with principle (1F), which requires only that a\nphysical event should have a sufficient physical cause at sometime at\nwhich it has a cause, not at every time at which it has a cause\u2014the\nlatter requirement only being imposed by the stronger principle\n(1G). \nIn a world containing the situation depicted in Fig. 2, a physical\nscientist might be able to discover all the physical events depicted\nthere, correctly identify each of them as a cause of P, and correctly\nclaim that certain combinations of them are sufficient causes of P.\nIn a sense, he would be in possession of a complete physical expla-\nnation of the occurrence of P, for he would have an explanation\nwhich correctly identifies all of P\u2019s physical causes up to a certain\ntime before the occurrence of P and a time (in fact, more than one\ntime) at which a subset of those causes is wholly sufficient for P.\nAnd yet, because the mental event M would be, as it were, invisible\nto him as a purely physical scientist, his explanation would be, in\nE. J. Lowe\n580\nanother sense, incomplete and would falsely represent the occur-\nrence of P as being coincidental. My suggestion is that the world of\nFig. 2 may in fact be our world. If it is our world, physical science\ncan present us with the semblance of a complete explanation of our\nbodily movements, and yet it will be an explanation which leaves\nsomething out, giving our bodily movements the appearance of\nbeing coincidental events arising from independent causal chains of\nevents in our brains and nervous systems. But isn\u2019t that precisely\nwhat current physical science does appear to do? As it traces back the\np hysical causes of our bodily movements into the maze of\nantecedent neural events, it seems to lose sight of any unifying fac-\ntor explaining why those apparently independent causal chains of\nneural events should have converged upon the bodily movements in\nquestion. In short, it leaves us with a kind of \u2018binding\u2019 problem, not\nunlike the \u2018binding\u2019 problem associated with conscious perceptual\nexperience (the problem of explaining how widely distributed and\napparently unrelated neural events in the cortex can support the\nexistence of unified perceptual experiences).17\nWhat I want to show next is that the relatively weak physical\ncausal closure principle (1F) is far from being the strongest such\nprinciple that is compatible with dualistic interactionism. In fact,\ndualistic interactionism is even consistent with a causal closure\nprinciple that is stronger in some ways than principle (1G), the\nstrongest principle that we have examined so far, apart from the\nquestion-begging principle (1E). The principle I have in mind is\nthe following:18\n(1H) Every physical event contains only other physical events in\nits transitive causal closure.\nBy the \u2018transitive causal closure\u2019 of an event P, I mean the set of\nevents consisting of the immediate causes of P, the immediate caus-\nCausal Closure Principles and Emer gentism\n581\n17 F or a description of the more familiar \u2018binding\u2019 problem, see Valerie\nGray Hard c a s t l e, \u2018Psych o l o gy \u2019s Binding Problem and Possibl e\nNeurobiological Solutions\u2019, Journal of Consciousness Studies 1 (1994), pp .\n66\u201390.\n18 Something like (IH) is suggested by the following recent remark of\nJaegwon Kim\u2019s: \u2018One way of stating the principle of physical causal clo-\nsure is this: If you pick any physical event and trace out its causal ancestry\nor posterity, that will never take you outside the physical domain. That is,\nno causal chain will ever cross the boundary between the physical and the\nnonphysical\u2019. See Jaegwon Kim, Mind in a Physical World: An Essay on the\nMind-Body Problem and Mental Causation (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press,\n1998), p. 40. Of course, another reading of this remark might equate it\nwith the excessively strong principle (1E).\nes of those causes, the immediate causes of those causes ... and so on:\nin short, the set which includes every event which stands in the\nancestral of the \u2018immediate cause\u2019 relation to P. The implication of\n(1H), then, is that the immediate causes of all physical events are\nalways and only other physical events. Principle (1H) clearly pro-\nhibits the situations depicted earlier in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 (remem-\nbering that an arrow between events depicted there signifies imme-\ndiate causation). Indeed, there is a clear sense in which principle\n(1H) is stronger than principle (1G)\u2014even when the latter is sup-\nplemented by a prohibition on simultaneous causation\u2014though it is\ntrue that (1H) is weaker in that it does not imply that any physical\nevent has a sufficient physical cause. However, in this respect (1H)\nhas an empirical advantage over (1G), inasmuch as it is compatible\nwith the claim, which is plausible in the light of quantum mechan-\nics, that at least some physical causation is irreducibly probabilistic.\nHow could dualistic interaction be compatible with principle\n(1H)? For the following reason. It could conceivably be the case\nthat, even though (1H) is true, sometimes a non-physical mental\nevent M causes it to be the case that certain physical events, P1, P2,\n... Pn, have a certain physical effect, P.\n19W hat this would involve is\nthe causation by a mental event of a physical causal fact. So I am\nassuming now a distinction between event-causation and fact-cau-\nsation. In a case of fact-causation, what is brought about is not an\nevent, but a fact or state of affairs. Some facts are causal facts, such\nas the fact that certain physical events, P1, P2, ... Pn, are causes of\nanother physical event, P. There is no reason in principle why such\na causal fact should not have a causal explanation and, indeed, there\nmay be a positive reason for seeking such an explanation, as I shall\nexplain later. Now, if a mental event M causes it to be the case that\ncertain physical events, P1, P2, ... Pn, have a certain physical effect,\nP, then, it seems clear, M is itself a cause of P\u2014but not an imme-\ndiate cause of P, nor an immediate cause of any of the physical\nevents P1, P2, ... Pn. In fact, it seems clear that M is not included in\nP\u2019s transitive causal closure and hence that M can be non-physical\nwithout violating principle (1H).\nThere is nothing unintelligible in principle about the notion of a\nmental event causing a physical causal fact, as the following theo-\nlogical example shows. Suppose that principle (1H) is true in a\nE. J. Lowe\n582\n19 F or an earlier development of this conception of mental causation,\nsee my Subjects of Experience, pp. 64\u201371 and 82ff. There are some resem-\nblances between my proposal and one made by Fred Dretske: see his\n\u2018Mental Events as Structuring Causes of Behavior\u2019, in J. Heil and A. R.\nMele (eds), Mental Causation (Oxf ord: Clarendon Press, 1993).\nworld in which every physical event has a sufficient physical cause\nand no physical causation is either simultaneous or backward. Such\na world can have no beginning in time, because it can have no first\nphysical event. (Suppose it did have a first physical event. By\nhypothesis, that event would have a sufficient physical cause, which\nwould have to be an earlier physical event or conjunction of such\nevents, contradicting the supposition just made.) And yet we could\nstill ask of this world why it should exist or be actual rather than any\nother. One intelligible answer would be to say that this world was\nactual because God had chosen it to be actual. God\u2019s choice, then,\nwould have caused it to be the case that a world containing certain\nphysical causal facts was actual\u2014and this would be mental causation\nof physical causal facts.\nWhat is envisaged here, it must be emphasised, is not God\u2019s caus-\ning certain initial physical events, which then go on to cause other\nphysical events in accordance with causal laws chosen by God\u2014 for\nin the envisaged world there are no \u2018initial\u2019 physical events, as the\nworld has no beginning in time. Now, of course, it may be asked\nwhen God\u2019s choice was made. If it was made at any time, it would\nseemingly have to have been made earlier than the occurrence of\nany physical event. That is not impossible, however, since a physi-\ncal world which has no beginning in time\u2014no first physical event\u2014\nneed not have a past of infinite duration, any more than a line of\nfinite length need have a first or last point. On the other hand, if\nGod\u2019s choice was not made at any time, because He is conceived to\nbe eternal or timeless, then it is true we cannot say that His choice\nwas an event\u2014but that in no way detracts from the fact that the\nexample demonstrates the intelligibility of mental causation of\nphysical causal facts.\nBut how could anything like this model of mental causation be\nenvisaged as applying in cases of ordinary human behaviour? How,\nfor instance, could a mental event, such as a choice of mine, cause it\nto be the case that certain physical events in my brain cause a cer-\ntain bodily movement of mine? But what is being requested here? If\nwhat is being requested is a demonstration that causation of this\nkind\u2014the causation of a physical causal fact by a mental event\u2014is\nintelligible, then we have already provided it by means of the fore-\ngoing theological example. If, on the other hand, what is being\nrequested is some account of the \u2018mechanism\u2019 that would be\ninvolved in such causation, in the human case, then it may be\nprotested that the request is perhaps unreasonable\u2014first of all\nbecause the term \u2018mechanism\u2019 is suggestive of purely physical cau-\nsation, which is precisely not being envisaged here, and secondly\nbecause supplying more detail about the possible nature of such\nCausal Closure Principles and Emer gentism\n583\ncausation in the human case may not properly be a matter for arm-\nchair philosophical speculation. My aim has only been to show that\ndualistic interactionism is compatible with a surprisingly strong\nform of physical causal closure principle, not to help the would-be\ninteractionist to construct a detailed model of psychophysical\ncausation. \nThis reply may seem unduly evasive. Is it not an unacceptable\nimplication of the proposed form of mental causation that the mind\nwould have to have the power to affect physical causal laws? Not\nnecessarily, for we need not assume that all causal relations between\nphysical events are subsumable under laws.20 There may be irre-\nducibly singular causation between physical events, in which case a\nmental event could cause a physical causal fact without necessarily\ncausing a change in physical laws. But if the real thought behind the\nobjection is that mental causation of the kind envisaged would\nsomehow inevitably conflict with the conservation laws of physics,\nthen I can only say, first, that the burden of proof in this matter lies\nwith my opponent and, second, that if, after all, the physicalist must\nfall back on an appeal to the conservation laws in an attempt to\ndefeat the dualist, then all the apparent advantages of appealing to\ncausal closure principles have fallen away and we have returned to\nthe tired old debate of earlier times.\nBut why, it may be asked, should we feel any need to invoke men-\ntal causation of the kind just proposed? The answer, once again,\nmight be that only by invoking such mental causation could we rep-\nresent the physical effect of certain physical causes\u2014such as a bod-\nily movement produced by a large number of apparently indepen-\ndent neural events in the brain\u2014as being non-coincidental, since\nthere might be no identifiable physical event(s) which could be seen\nto link the chains of physical causation involved in an appropriate\nway. At the same time, there might be strong empirical evidence\nthat a mentalev ent was playing precisely such a role, and a strong\nintuition that the bodily movement in question was not an event\nwhich occurred \u2018by coincidence\u2019. All of this would be perfectly\ncompatible with a naturalistic form of emergentism, moreover,\nsince we could still suppose that every mental event ultimately has\na sufficient physical cause. Of course, a physicalist might object that\nif empirical evidence did confirm that a mental event was playing\nthe kind of causal role now being mooted, we would have to con-\nE. J.

But why would we have to\nconclude this, in the absence of any direct empirical evidence for the\nexistence of such a physical event?
