Whitty \n& \nDr. Adrian N.

This paper builds on the current \nresearch by exploring theoretical explanations for how individuals might rationalise their \nonline affairs. Drawing from Klein\u2019s object-relations theory we suggest that while on one \nlevel individuals might perceive their online interactions to be \u2018unreal\u2019 and hence not \n\u2018breaking the rules\u2019 in respect to the offline relationship, on another level energy is being \ntaken away from the relationship and given to another, which is indeed \u2018breaking the rules\u2019. \n \n \nKeywords: cyber-cheating, Internet infidelity, Klein, splitting, object-relations, Winnicott \n \nTaking the Good with the Bad \n \n2 \nTaking the Good with the Bad: Applying Klein\u2019s Work to further our Understandings \nof Cyber-Cheating \n \nCyber-cheating is still a relatively under-researched and under-theorised topic in the \nsocial sciences. Atwood (2002) asserts that \u201chealthcare professionals are often unfamiliar with \nthe dynamics associated with the relatively new concept of cyber-affairs and the electronic \nprocess of \u2018virtual cheating\u2019 and thus often do not consider the behaviour as infidelity\u201d (p. \n37). Given this claim, it would seem that there is an urgent need to consider whether online \ninteractions and erotic activities online are considered to be real acts of betrayal by \nindividuals and their offline partners, and if this behaviour needs to be considered more \nseriously by healthcare professionals (e.g., relationship counsellors). The research, to date, \nsuggests that cyber-affairs can have a real and possibly serious impact on the offline \nrelationship. Whitty (2003a), for instance, found that individuals do perceive that some \ninteractions that occur online can be considered as acts of betrayal. The study identified three \nmain components of infidelity: sexual; emotional; and, porn. Moreover, it was found that \nsome acts, such as sexual acts pose a greater threat than other acts, such as viewing \npornography. \nIn this paper, we would like to extend on current work in the field by considering \ntheoretically the processes that might take place when people do have cyber-affairs. While we \ndo not subscribe to the view that all online relationships and erotic acts ought to be considered \nacts of infidelity to all people, we are limiting this paper to considerations to the \npsychological processes that might take place when these are considered to be acts of \nbetrayal. We firstly consider here, drawing from Winnicott\u2019s (1971\/1997) work on potential \nspace, how cyberspace might be seen as an attractive place to play at love and that in many \ninstances this can be therapeutic for individuals. We then turn to considerations raised by \nTaking the Good with the Bad \n \n3 \ntheorists, such as Civin (2000), that cyberspace can also be debilitating. We examine how \nonline infidelities might be perceived by some to be \u2018unreal\u2019 acts and focus on justifications \nand excuses perpetrators might use to explain away these encounters. The taken-for-granted \nrules of a relationship are also focused on here. Drawing from the foundational object-\nrelations work of Melanie Klein (1986), in relation to the process of splitting, we argue that \npeople are more easily able to justify their online affairs when compared to their offline \naffairs. To illustrate our argument we provide examples, from a recent study, where \nindividuals were asked to respond to a hypothetical scenario on cyber-cheating (Whitty, \n2003c). It is noteworthy that while we would also argue that cyberspace is not limited to \nInternet interactions, we have restricted this paper to considerations of Internet affairs. We are \nof the view that attempting to understand, in greater detail, the psychological processes that \ntake place when individuals cyber-cheat may lead to improved treatments for Internet \ninfidelity. The paper goes some way in contributing to raising awareness of some of the more \nserious consequences of cyber-affairs. \n \nPlaying at love: Object-relations \nPreviously we have argued, when read through the optic of Winnicott\u2019s (1971\/1997) \nobject-relations theory, that cyberspace has potential therapeutic benefits to offer. We have \nsuggested that cyberspace is a safe and imaginative place to play at flirting and love (Whitty, \n2003b; Whitty & Carr, 2003). \nWinnicott was very interested in what he called the potential space \u2014 a space \nbetween the mother and the infant. He contrasted this \"potential space (a) with the inner world \n(which is related to the psychosomatic partnership) and (b) with actual, or external reality\" \n(Winnicott, 1971\/1997, p. 41). Winnicott understood \u2018potential spaces\u2019 to be an area of \nintermediate experiencing that is between inner and outer worlds, \u201cbetween the subjective \nTaking the Good with the Bad \n \n4 \nobject and the object objectively perceived\u201d (Winnicott, 1971\/1997, p. 100). Winnicott \n(1971\/1997) argued that the potential space is: \nthe hypothetical area that exists (but cannot exist) between the baby and the object (mother \nof part of mother) during the phase of the repudiation of the object as not-me, that is, at the \nend of being merged in with the object. (p. 107) \n \nWinnicott noticed, for example, how an infant would suck and hug a doll or blanket. \nHe suggested that the doll or blanket did not represent a doll or blanket as such, but is rather \nan as-if object. The infant makes use of the illusion that although this is not the breast, \ntreating it as such will allow an appreciation of what is \u201cme\u201d and what is \u201cnot-me\u201d \n(Winnicott, 1971\/1997, p. 41). Although referred to as a transitional object, \u201cit is not the \nobject, of course that is transitional\u201d (Winnicott, 1971\/1997, p. 14). The object is the initial \nmanifestation of a different positioning of the infant in the world. The doll or blanket, thus, \nconnects to subjective experience, but is in the objective world. \nWhile the notions of transitional objects and potential space are raised within a context \nof an infant, Winnicott (1971\/1997) insists, however, they are not simply confined to the \ninfants\u2019 experience, but is something that \u201cthroughout life is retained in the intense \nexperiencing that belongs to the arts and to religion and to imaginative living, and to creative \nscientific work\u201d (p. 24). We come to rely upon our own resources to experience culture to \nexpand our understanding of the world. In his expanded views on mental health and \ncreativity, Winnicott argues that a person who lives in a realm of subjective omnipotence, \nwith no bridge to objective reality, is self-absorbed and autistic. A person who lived only in \nthe realm of objective reality, with no roots in subjective omnipotence, was viewed by \nWinnicott as superficially adjusted, but lacking passion and originality. This realm provides \nrelief \u201cfrom the strain of relating inner and outer reality \u2026 that no human is free from\u201d \n(Winnicott, 1971\/1997, p. 24). The tension and strain between inner and outer worlds is not \nTaking the Good with the Bad \n \n5 \neliminated, but is bound in this space. Culture and cultural activity, in this context, is an \nexpression of the \u201cinter-play between separateness and union\u201d (Winnicott, 1971\/1997, p. 24). \nThe potential space is not pure fantasy, nor is it pure reality. \u201cIn the absence of \npotential space, there is only fantasy; within potential space imagination can develop\u201d \n(Ogden, 1985, p. 133). Winnicott believed that given a \u2018good enough\u2019 environment the \ninterplay of the inner world and external reality promotes the development of self and \nfacilitates growth. It is a space where we can develop psychologically, to integrate love and \nhate and to create, destroy and re-create ourselves (see Winnicott, 1971\/1997, p. 41). \nIn line with Winnicott\u2019s object-relations theory, we have suggested that cyberspace is \na potential space (Whitty, 2003b, Whitty & Carr, 2003). Cyberspace, like Winnicott\u2019s \npotential space is perhaps a space somewhere outside the individual, but is still not the \nexternal world. The participants and their transitional objects: the computers, monitors, \nkeyboards, mice, software, modems, text, cables, telephone lines, and so forth; all occupy this \npotential space \u2014 a space between the 'real individuals' and the 'fantasy individuals'. \nWe have argued that flirting is a type of play that can occur in this potential space \u2014 \ncyberspace. Cyber-flirting, although akin in some ways with offline flirting, is characterised \nhere as a unique activity that is a form of play. Of course it can be argued, with justification, \nthat offline flirting is also a form of play. That said, cyberspace seems to offer more \nopportunities for the type of play that Winnicott described. Similarly, cyberspace offers \nopportunities for this play to be transformational. We have expressed this view given that \noffline flirting requires that another be physically present. In face-to-face interactions \nrejection is more possible and probably more damaging to one\u2019s self concept. Cyberspace, in \ncontrast, gives to many the appearance of a safer environment; a safer space to play and \nexperiment at flirting. Moreover, rejection is less likely to cause distress when you can \nTaking the Good with the Bad \n \n6 \ndisconnect at any time, and the chances are remarkably decreased as to the likelihood of ever \nhaving a chance meeting with one\u2019s cyber-playmate. \n \nA darker side of the Internet \nWhile contending that cyberspace can be potentially a therapeutic place to play at love \nwe have also acknowledged that cyberspace also has its dark side (Whitty & Carr, 2003). We \nwould also not dismiss the notion that engaging in intimate relationships or erotic acts online \nmight even have a positive effect (at least for the person engaging in these activities). \nHowever, in the context of this paper, like Civin (2000), we would like to propose that \u201cJust \nas cyberspace may potentiate, it may also thwart and debilitate\u201d (p. 40). \nCivin (2000) proposes that cyberspace is not as transitional and facilitative as it was \nfirst considered by academics. Perhaps this is because of the changing nature of this space, or \npossibly this is because the darker aspects of cyberspace were not taken into account by early \nresearchers. Civin (2000) has brought to our attention that \u201c\u2026 that no object or process, the \ncyber system included is essentially transitional\u201d (p. 39). Continuing this line of argument, he \nreminds the reader that Winnicott was not suggesting that all teddy bears and blankets are \nessentially transitional! Likewise, not all cyber systems will act as transitional objects! He \nadds that, in stark contrast, cyber systems are potentially invasive, so much so that they can \nfoster persecutory anxiety. Civin states, that for some, \u201cthe computer system seems a far cry \n(in all meanings) from the teddy bear or favorite blanket, and the breach between the cyber \nsystem and the transitional or potential looms unnegotiably vast\u201d (2000, p. 51). \nCivin (2000) presents the reader with case studies to illustrate how the cyber system \ncan foster persecutory anxiety. For example, in his presentation of the online experiences of a \nperson he calls Jeannette, Civin demonstrates how she was eventually forced off the net after \nshe angered someone for sharing software he had sent to her. This rage changed to jealousy \nTaking the Good with the Bad \n \n7 \nand Jeannette found she was being emailed more frequently than she could cope with and, in \naddition, feared her husband would eventually discover her online relationships. Other \nexamples of deleterious effects of cyberspace might include, harassment, cyberstalking, and \naddiction. This paper, however, examines the problems that arise when individuals engage in \ncyber-affairs. \n \nMelanie Klein: \u2018Good\u2019 and \u2018Bad\u2019 objects \nWe would like to suggest here, that while the motivations for an online affair might be \nsimilar to why individuals seek affairs offline (e.g., problems encountered in the relationships, \npersonality factors) the appeal and the way the online relationship is perceived can be \npotentially different. We would argue that online affairs may appear to be in some ways more \nseductive than offline affairs.  \nTo explain this we would like to draw from Melanie Klein\u2019s work on splitting. \nSplitting, she believed, was one of the most primitive or basic defence mechanisms against \nanxiety. According to Klein (1986) the ego prevents the \u2018bad\u2019 part of the object from \ncontaminating the \u2018good\u2019 part of the object by splitting it off and disowning a part of itself. \nAn infant in its relationship with the mother\u2019s breast conceives it as both a good and bad \nobject. The breast gratifies and frustrates and the infant will simultaneously project both love \nand hate on to it. On the one hand the infant idealises this \u2018good\u2019 object, but on the other \nhand, the \u2018bad\u2019 object is seen as terrifying, frustrating and a persecutor threatening to destroy \nboth the infant and the \u2018good\u2019 object (Carr, 1997). The infant projects love and idealizes the \ngood object but goes beyond mere projection in trying to induce in the mother feelings toward \nthe bad object for which she must take responsibility (that is, a process of projective \nidentification). This stage of development Klein termed the paranoid-schizoid position. The \ninfant may, as another defence mechanism for this less developed ego, seek to deny the reality \nTaking the Good with the Bad \n \n8 \nof the persecutory object. While in the normal development we pass through this phase, this \nprimitive defence against anxiety is a regressive reaction that, in a sense of always being \navailable to us, is never transcended. The \u2018good\u2019 objects in the developed super-ego come to \nrepresent the fantasized ego-ideal and thus \u201cthe possibility of a return to narcissism\u201d \n(Schwartz, 1999, p. 18). \n In line with Klein\u2019s object-relations theory it might be useful to understand the \nindividual one is having an online affair to be the \u2018good object\u2019. Given that the interactions \nthat take place in cyberspace can be seen as separate to the outside world it is potentially \neasier to split an online affair off from the rest of the individuals\u2019 world. As we will elaborate \non further in this paper, the online relationship can potentially cater to an unfettered, impotent \nfantasy this is difficult to measure up to in reality. Hence, the online affair can potentially lead \nto a narcissistic withdrawal. \n \nRelationship scripts \nEngaging in extra-dyadic relationships is considered by most individuals, at least in \nWestern countries, to be an act of betrayal. It is generally taken-for-granted by heterosexual \ncouples that engaging in an intimate relationship with someone other than one\u2019s partner, \nespecially in respect to sexual activities, is unacceptable and a breach of the rules of the \nrelationship. Research has found that sexual infidelity is one of the most common causes of \nmarital break-ups (e.g., Betzig, 1989; Pittman & Wagers, 1995). In fact, Pittman and Wagers \n(1995) found that, in their clinical experience, more than 90% of divorces were attributed to \nsexual infidelity. \nWhile heterosexuals might have scripts available to them as to what are acceptable \nface-to-face interactions with the opposite sex while still maintaining a romantic relationship, \ngiven the nature and the newness of the Internet, the rules are yet to be clearly established as \nTaking the Good with the Bad \n \n9 \nto what are acceptable online encounters. Although it has been found that individuals hold \nsimilar attitudes towards online and offline infidelities (Whitty, 2003a), more recent work has \nfound that when presented with a hypothetical scenario of a partner potentially cheating \nonline, that not all participants were convinced that this was \u2018real\u2019 betrayal (Whitty, 2003c). \nIn the study referred to here, participants were given one of two versions of a story-\ncompletion task based on a task devised about traditional offline infidelity by Kitzinger and \nPowell (1995). They were presented with one of the versions presented below: \nVersion A: Mark and Jennifer have been going out for over a year. Then Mark realises \nthat Jennifer has developed a relationship with someone else over the Internet\u2026; \nVersion B: Jennifer and Mark have been going out for over a year. Then Jennifer \nrealises that Mark has developed a relationship with someone else over the Internet\u2026 \n \nWhile Kitzinger and Powell (1995) found that 90% of their sample interpreted their \ncue story, which was developed in respect to offline infidelity, to be an act of sexual \ninvolvement, this was not the case in this particular study. While all of the participants \nunderstood this to be a dilemma about infidelity, some were divided as to whether the \nbetrayer believed they were committing an act of infidelity, while others wrote that the \npartner was not certain that they had been betrayed. Moreover, unlike Kitzinger and Powell\u2019s \nstudy, when participants interpreted the cue story as a story about sexual involvement, this \nwas not necessarily about a sexual relationship, but in many cases was exclusively an \nemotional involvement. \nAlthough the majority of the participants (86%) wrote in their stories that the \naggrieved felt that they had been betrayed, and 51% wrote that the betrayer believed that they \nhad been unfaithful, a number of participants were uncertain that this was a scenario about \ninfidelity. Explanations given as to why the scenario should not be considered as infidelity \nwere that: \n\u2022 the interaction was \u2018just a friendship\u2019; \n\u2022 the interaction was merely flirtation or fun; \nTaking the Good with the Bad \n \n10 \n\u2022 the relationship was with an object (computer) in virtual space, rather than \nwith a real human being; \n\u2022 the interaction was with two people who had never met and did not ever intend \nto meet; and,  \n\u2022 it could not be infidelity as there was no physical sex taking place. \n \nGiven that the results from this study present somewhat different results to the \nKitzinger and Powell\u2019s study on offline infidelity, this suggests that there is something \ndifferent about the relationships we form online. This can be partly attributed to some \npeople\u2019s beliefs that these relationships are not completely real. As illustrated in the following \nquote elicited from the study mentioned above: \nMark at first brushes it off thinking that its \u201conly the Internet, no harm in having fun.\u201d \n(12MM) \n \nFitness (2001) has pointed out that the key to defining betrayal lies in \u201crelationship \nknowledge structures\u201d; for example, individuals\u2019 theories, beliefs and expectations about how \nrelationships should normally work and how their own relationships should work. Given that \nthe types of interactions that take place online are somewhat different and perhaps in some \nways feel less real than offline relationships, it might be that virtual sex and developing close \nemotional bonds with someone online might be perceived by some as not breaking the rules \nof the offline relationship. However, in saying this, we would like to suggest that acts of \ninfidelity are not necessarily limited to sexual acts, such as sexual intercourse, kissing and so \nforth. Rather, part of the expectations of a relationship can be both \u2018mental exclusivity\u2019 as well \nas \u2018sexual exclusivity\u2019 (Yarab, Sensibaugh & Allgeier, 1998). As Fitness (2001) also \ncontends:  \nEssentially, betrayal means that one party in a relationship acts in a way that favours his or \nher own interests at the expense of the other party\u2019s interests. In one sense, this behaviour \nimplies that the betrayer regards his or her needs as more important than that needs of the \npartner in or the relationship. In a deeper sense, however, betrayal sends an ominous signal \nabout how little the betrayer cares about, or values his or her relationship with, the \nbetrayed partner. (p. 73) \n \nTaking the Good with the Bad \n \n11 \nHence, if acts of betrayal are not limited to \u2018real\u2019 sexual acts then it is quite plausible to \nconsider various types of online relating to be construed as acts of infidelity by the offline \ncouple. \nThis notion that online acts can be considered as acts of betrayal is nicely summarised \nin the following extract: \n\u201cIt is cheating.\u201d She said rather calmly. \n\u201cNo I\u2019m not cheating. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m bonking her anyway. You\u2019re the one I\u2019m with \nand like I said I have NO intentions of meeting her.\u201d He hopped into bed. \n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2018emotional\u2019 cheating.\u201d She said getting annoyed. \n\u201cHow so?\u201d He asked, amusement showing in his eyes. \n\u201cCheating isn\u2019t necessarily physical. That\u2019s one side of it \u2026\u201d H e pulled the sheets \nover him and rolled over. \n\u201cWell\u2026 I know you have not met her yet that\u2019s why, but I\u2019m still a little annoyed, \nMark.\u201d She sat on the edge of the bed. \n\u201cDon\u2019t be mad. You\u2019re the one I love. So how is it emotional cheating.\u201d He sat up. \n\u201cYou\u2019re keeping stuff from me. Relationships are about trust! How can I trust you if \nyou keep stuff from me about the \u2018Internet\u2019 girl\u2019?\u201d (51FM) \n \nOnline relationships: Fantasy or reality? \nIf we are to take on the argument that cyberspace can be perceived in a similar way to \nWinnicott\u2019s understanding of potential space (see Whitty, 2003b; Whitty & Carr, 2003) then \nwhile potential space does offer greater opportunities to flirt and play at love, these \nrelationships are not complete fantasy. We would like to suggest here that given the lack of \nscripts currently available as to what is acceptable behaviour online and given the nature of \ncyberspace, some individuals might find it easier to justify or rationalise engaging in an \nonline affair. On one level the relationship or sexual encounter can be seen as fantasy and not \nreal. However, at another level, the relationship or sexual encounter can be understood as \nhurting the offline relationship. Therefore, in line with Melanie Klein\u2019s work, we would like \nto propose that splitting is easier to do in respect to online infidelity than offline infidelity. \nFitness (2001) contends that there are four main ways that individuals account for \ntheir betrayal: a) conceding that an offence has been committed accompanied by remorse and \nTaking the Good with the Bad \n \n12 \npossibly an attempt to re-establish the relationship; b) an admittance of the offence together \nwith excuses of extenuating circumstances, such as alcohol, stress, and illness; c) in a more \ndefensive account where the offence is admitted, however, the offender minimizes its \nwrongness or seriousness; and, d) denials of having committed any offence or refusals to take \nany responsibility for it. \nWhile the stories in Whitty\u2019s study (2003c) demonstrated examples of each of these \naccounts, a unique finding that emerged was that when excuses were made, they were \ntypically along the lines of the relationship not being real. However, when confronted with \nthis excuse the aggrieved would still see that an act of betrayal had occurred and as a \nconsequence trust had been broken. This is exemplified in the following extracts: \n\u201cWhen she confronts him about it one night over dinner, he denies everything saying that they \nwere just friends. And that she should not take it so seriously and worry about it because it \nwas not a real relationship, but a net relationship. That net relationships mean nothing \nbecause everyone lives in virtual reality. Jennifer accepts his theory, but decides to leave him \nin the end, her departing words are, \u201cI\u2019m sorry Mark, but I can\u2019t be with someone who wants \nto live in virtual reality with someone, and in reality with me.\u201d (6FM) \n \n\u201cShe tried to explain that he was just a faithful companion and the only feelings he had were \nnot real as this man was just words on a screen, but he couldn\u2019t understand the relationship \nand why she would need to tell others of their private lives.\u201d (55FJ) \n \nInterestingly, the second extract raises another expectation of an offline relationship; that \nthere are some aspects of the offline relationship that ought to remain private and not shared \nwith others. Part of the objection the aggrieved seems to have here is that the perpetrator has \ninverted priorities. \nIt has been argued that offline infidelity occurs because there are problems in the \nrelationship, or because of certain personality characteristics (see Fitness, 2001). Buss and \nShackelford (1997) have identified some key reasons why people betray their partners, \nincluding: complaints that one\u2019s partner sexualizes others; exhibits of high levels of jealousy \nand possessiveness; is condescending; sexual withholding; and, abuses alcohol. Of greater \ninterest to this paper is that Buss and Shackelford found a strong link between narcissism and \nTaking the Good with the Bad \n \n13 \nsusceptibility to infidelity. These are perhaps the same reasons why individuals are motivated \nto initiate online affairs. However, drawing from Klein\u2019s theory, we would like to suggest that \nthese relationships are perhaps easier to maintain than an offline affair. We contend that the \nonline relationship can become idealised through the process of splitting, while \nsimultaneously, denying the \u2018bad\u2019 aspects of the person they are having the affair with and at \nthe same time the bad aspects in themselves. It is possibly easier to idealise an individual \nonline (the \u2018good\u2019 object) when you can more easily filter out the potential negative aspects of \nthe relationship (the \u2018bad\u2019 object). The relationship can be turned on or off at one\u2019s leisure \nand the communication content, to some extent, can be more easily controlled. Moreover, the \nInternet does provide an environment where it is easier to construct a more positive view of \nthe self and avoid presenting the negative aspects of the self. In contrast, it is not so easy to \nindulge in one\u2019s fantasies of perfection in an offline affair as one has to still deal with the \n\u2018real\u2019 person.  \nThe work of Christopher Bollas is also useful to consider here. Bollas (1987) \ndescribed how the search for the idealised lover can be a quest to compensate for a deficiency \nin the ego. As he states: \nSome forms of erotomania may be efforts to establish the other as the transformational \nobject. The search for the perfect crime or the perfect woman is not only a quest for an \nidealized object. It also constitutes some recognition in the subject of a deficiency in ego \nexperience. The search, even though it serves to split the bad experience from the subject\u2019s \ncognitive knowledge, is nonetheless a semiological act that signifies the person\u2019s search \nfor a particular object relation that is associated with ego transformation and repair of the \n\u2018basic fault\u2019. (Bollas, 1987, p. 18) \n \nIn line with Bollas\u2019s thinking, cyberspace provides more radical opportunities to find \nthat perfect object, the object that resonates with the good aspects of oneself and that allows \none to disregard the \u2018bad\u2019 objects that perhaps the offline lover is more inclined to bring to \none\u2019s attention. Also, given the potential anonymous nature of the Internet, one is less likely \nto be caught out engaging in online infidelities. Hence, as argued earlier, cyberspace does in \nTaking the Good with the Bad \n \n14 \nmany ways provide one with a safer place to play at love. Moreover, as Cooper (1998) \ncontends, three factors that make the Internet such a powerful medium for online sexual \nactivities, include \u2018access\u2019, \u2018affordability\u2019 and \u2018anonymity\u2019. Taken together these aspects \nsuggests that cyberspace is not only a different place for infidelities to be acted out but \npossibly a more attractive space to engage in such activities \u2013 in spite of that absence of \u2018real\u2019 \nphysical sex. \nIn conclusion, we believe that despite the lack of real bodies in cyberspace, online \naffairs can have a real impact on the offline relationship. We have raised the notion here that, \ngiven the nature of cyberspace, individuals might be more easily able to rationalise their \nonline betrayals, however, this does not necessarily make the betrayal any less severe. \nMoreover, online relationships have a certain seductive appeal which in some ways could be \npotentially more damaging to an offline relationship than an offline affair. Drawing from \nKlein\u2019s work we have made the claim here that splitting is easier with an online affair \ncompared to an offline affair, where the object of one\u2019s affections in face-to face encounters \nare more real are apparent. \n \nReferences \nAtwood, J.
