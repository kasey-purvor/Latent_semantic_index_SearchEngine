These may give rise in the researcher to\nconfusion, anxiety and doubt about who is who and what is what; but also to the possibility\nof real emotional and relational depth in the research process. Using illustrations from three\nsocial work doctoral research projects undertaken by students at the Tavistock Clinic and the\nUniversity of East London the paper examines four themes that seem to the author to be\ncentral to meaningful practice-near research undertaken in a spirit of true emotional and\nepistemological open-mindedness: the smell of the real; losing our minds; the inevitability of\npersonal change; and the discovery of complex particulars.\nKeywords research; qualitative; ethnography; epistemology; emotional\nexperience; transformation\nIn this job you have to talk to people about things that really no one should ever be\nmade to talk about.\n(Child protection social worker)\n22 corpses\nI am a fan, or I should really say an addict, of the American TV series The Wire. Set in\nthe city of Baltimore, the five seasons of The Wire explore the complex inter-\nrelationships between the police department, the drug dealers, suppliers and addicts of\nthe streets and corners \u2014 many of whom are children \u2014 and the politicians and the\nmedia. Part of what engrossed me from the beginning about The Wire is that it is like\nwatching ethnography on TV, and if a really good TV series were ever made about\nsocial work I think it would necessarily have some of the characteristics of The Wire.\nTerrible things happen in the course of the narrative that unfolds.

These are the corpses of various people executed by Marlo,\nthe dominant West Side drug dealer, and his hit man and hit woman, because they\nbecame inconvenient; they snitched, they were rivals, and so on.\nThe promotional statement on the Season 5 DVD box begins by saying: \u2018In a city\nthat can no longer even recognise its problems, much less begin to solve them, police\ndetectives attempt to bring in one last worthy case against a violent crew of narcotics\ntraffickers\u2019 (HBO, 2008). This idea \u2014 of a city that can no longer recognise its\nproblems \u2014 intrigued me. A few years ago I wrote a book with a colleague about the\nchanging nature of the welfare state project in Britain, in which we proposed that one of\nthe functions of an organised welfare state was to enable society to recognise, tolerate\nthe knowledge of, and act upon its own problems (Cooper & Lousada, 2005). In one\nchapter, I used the example of the Cleveland sexual abuse crisis of the late 1980s to\nexplore how our social and professional capacity to tolerate new \u2018dangerous\nknowledge\u2019 about ourselves and the society we inhabit cannot be taken for granted. The\noutcome of that crisis was broadly that we accepted the much greater prevalence of\nsexual abuse in our midst, but at the time it was a tremendous contest with an uncertain\nresolution. Powerful groupings fought hard in the public domain to deny that there was\nany validity to what was being uncovered. At the time many of us did not know what to\nbelieve or think. This was partly because we did not have a proper conceptual apparatus\nat either a personal or social level with which to think the difficult thoughts about the\nunwelcome realities that were emerging into the light of the public day.\nJust down the street\nIn 2008 and 2009 I think something of the same climate has been evident in the wake of\nthe trial of Baby Peter\u2019s1 killers, their sentencing, and the eventual disclosure of their\nidentities. The climate during the weeks when this tragic case was at the forefront of\nmedia and political attention in Britain felt very different to that which surrounded the\nlast big \u2018child abuse scandal\u2019 in Britain \u2014 the death of Victoria Climbie\u00b4 and the Public\nInquiry that ensued. At the height of the \u2018Baby P\u2019 crisis the public domain felt unusually\nvolatile, as though there was a chance that government might do something truly panic-\nstricken and damaging to the social work profession, or that the vigilante climate might\nresult in the murder or suicide of one of the social work staff involved, although by the\nend of the most acute period there was also a sense of a better realisation in\ngovernment and in the public sphere of what the realities of child protection work\nentail. At the height of this period of anxiety I wrote an article in a national newspaper\n(Cooper, 2008), saying that some people who abuse and torture children need to carry\non doing this. They are expelling something intolerable, dangerous, and murderous\nin themselves into someone else, and might be severely destabilised in themselves if\nstopped. They also usually know what they are doing, and that it is a dreadful\ncrime. For them, the stakes could not be higher in relation to those people \u2014 social\nworkers \u2014 charged with recognising and naming what is happening.\nWhen social work is accused of \u2018failing\u2019, I tend to think that the charge is really that\nwe have failed at a certain point to shield the general public from awareness of those very\nrealities that we do succeed, most of the time, in protecting people from having to\ncontemplate. But maybe a bigger proportion of the public understand this than we\nJOURNAL OF SOC IAL WORK PRACT ICE43 0\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n7:2\n1 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \nimagine is the case. During the week when the Baby P crisis was at its height, the most\nintelligent conversation I felt I had was with a London cab driver who said, \u2018I can\u2019t read\nabout that case in the papers \u2014 it\u2019s too distressing . . . I couldn\u2019t do that job,\nI wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep at night\u2019. He laughed a little nervously and looked at me in\nthe mirror, and said \u2018I suppose I wouldn\u2019t have been a very good social worker\u2019. This is\none thing social workers do at a societal level \u2014 help people sleep at night, not because\nwe are defending the realm against communists, terrorists or insurgents, but because\nwe are protecting people from the emotional impact of knowing about the torture of\nbabies that may be happening just down the street.\nUgly facts\nResearch is about generating \u2018new knowledge\u2019 but in my view it is also about enlarging\nthe scope of our self-knowledge in the personal, professional and societal domains. We\nneed sound methodologies for conducting research of any kind, but actually we can\nonly hope to generate new knowledge in so far as we are emotionally and ideologically\nopen to the possibility of discovering something new, including things we really did not\nwant to know. If we are blind to or defended against this possibility then the best\nmethodologies may not help us much, although we should recognise that the formal\nproperties of many research methodologies exist precisely in order to ensure\nsystematic open-mindedness. Charles Darwin apparently referred to the necessity of\nfirst collecting the \u2018ugly facts\u2019 if we were to hope to build a beautiful theory; but we\nknow from the work of Kuhn and others on paradigm shifts (Kuhn, 1962) that even the\ncollection of \u2018ugly\u2019 or inconvenient facts may not disturb a settled world view, until\nthat world view is ready to be disturbed or until someone proposes an alternative\ntheory that embraces everything explained by the old one, as well as the inconvenient\nfacts it couldn\u2019t account for. This is so much more the case in psycho-social research\nand social life than it is in the material or life sciences, because the world we are\ninvestigating is our world \u2014 a construct of meanings, affects, relationships etc. that can\nnever be fully independent of the researcher, or the knowing subject with his or her\ntheoretical commitments.\nThis view of research in social work, and I will shortly come to the question of\n\u2018practice-near\u2019 research, sets it decisively apart from other views of research which try\nto keep faith with something I will call \u2018proper science\u2019 for short \u2014 the proponents of\nthe possibility of \u2018objective knowledge\u2019 to be acquired through \u2018proper\u2019 scientific\nmethod. I think that practice-near social work research is, or should be, part of a total\nworld view of sufficient power and legitimacy to rival that which the \u2018proper scientists\u2019\nhave the privilege and security of occupying. We are some way from achieving this in\nrelation to practice-near research, if it is even a goal to which we would aspire \u2014 since\nit may be that many proponents of qualitative social research think the idea of a single,\nstable, secure and settled epistemological world view with respect to psycho-social\nworlds is a rather dangerous illusion.\nSo what does practice-near research involve? What does it give us? What is its\nimplied world view, if any? My thoughts about this are based partly on the kinds of\nthings I believe it should be and should deliver, but also on the kinds of things it is\ndelivering in my experience\u2014 though in truth this is mostly not based on my first hand\nEMOT IONAL AND EP ISTEMOLOG ICAL CHALLENGES 4 31\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n7:2\n1 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \nexperience but on that of doctoral students who I\u2019ve been privileged to work with in\nrecent years. \u2018Practice\u2019 is about people, relationships, and organisations and social\nsystems such as teams and networks made up of people and relationships. If we want to\nask what it might mean to get \u2018near\u2019 to practice then we might rephrase the question as\n\u2018what happens when we get close, emotionally or physically, to people?\u2019. Here are a few\nof the possible answers I can think of, which I will try to illustrate with examples from\nrecent research. Each item is in fact inter-twined with all the others.\n(1) The smell of the real \u2014 practice-near research will bring us close to people in a\nvisceral, bodily, and therefore live emotional way. This can be exciting, or\nperturbing, or both, but whichever it is likely to be hard to stay \u2018objective\u2019 or\n\u2018dispassionate\u2019 in research endeavours of this kind. Practice-near research will be\npassionate research about passions, in which the boundaries of the researcher\u2019s self\nare likely to become fluid and uncertain. Consequently, we need methodologies\nthat can help us with the intensity and epistemological uncertainties that arise from\nsuch research encounters.\n(2) Losing our minds\u2014 the closer we come to other people the greater the likelihood\nthat we will become psychically mixed up with them. This could be because we\nfall in love with them, because we hate or despise them with inexplicable\nintensity, or we swing between the two, or any of a thousand other ways we have\nof entangling ourselves one with another. We all need other people to project\ninto, and so of course others are doing this with us, and often we accept these\nprojections without realising that they are not \u2018us\u2019. We lose parts of ourselves in\nothers, and find ourselves inhabited by the lost parts of others. You can deny that\nall this is so, and that is your perfect right, but if you accept it, or something like it,\nthen you will need a theoretical account of how such processes operate in order to\nsuccessfully manage the research act, and extricate yourself from potential\nconfusion.\n(3) The inevitability of personal change\u2014 the psychological intensity of these kinds of\nencounters changes us, whether we wish for this or not. Thus, I have come to the\nconclusion that a test of whether something really is \u2018practice-near\u2019 research might\nbe whether or not the researcher felt themselves to be changed as a person in the\ncourse of the work.\n(4) The discovery of \u2018complex particulars\u2019 \u2014 if you are close enough to your research\nsubject for all the above to be happening then you won\u2019t be engaged with large\npopulations of research subjects, but just because you are studying specific cases or a\nsmall range of particulars does not mean the research has no wider or even universal\nsignificance. The closer one comes to a single case, the more its uniqueness and\nparticularity demands to be understood; but equally the more its value for the\nillumination of all other cases with which there is a family resemblance becomes\nevident. This view of matters poses, in my view, a fundamental challenge to the\ncontinuing dominance of a positivist world view.\n(1) The smell of the real\nWhen we come close to people we become directly aware of their bodies, and they of\nours \u2014 we smell them, even if we aren\u2019t touching them. We may like what we smell\nJOURNAL OF SOC IAL WORK PRACT ICE43 2\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n7:2\n1 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \nand be attracted to them, or we may be repulsed by their bad breath or body odour.\nProbably we find it difficult to be emotionally neutral about being so near to someone,\nbut if, let\u2019s say, we encounter an unpleasant smell, we may reflect that it is difficult for\npeople to smell themselves. If people were aware of their powerful bad breath for\nexample, they would presumably take steps to prevent it more often than they seem to;\nbut such reflections may mean we start to wonder anxiously about our own body\nodours . . . or, perturbed by these thoughts, we may try not to think them. This of\ncourse is the kind of territory that Isabel Menzies Lyth was disclosing to us in her classic\n1959 paper \u2018A case study of the functioning of social systems as a defence against\nanxiety\u2019 (Menzies Lyth, 1959) in which she theorised about the impact on hospital\norganisational life of the daily experience of nurses in close emotional and physical\ncontact with patients.\nIn her study of the dynamics and processes that underlie critical incidents in high\nsecurity settings such as special hospitals, Jude Deacon (2009) recorded and analysed a\nvariety of long-term consultations and supervisory processes with workers who are\nsubject to the kinds of emotional and organisational pressures likely to be encountered\non a daily basis by staff working in high security settings with very disturbed and\ndangerous people. As with many of the public inquiries into health and welfare\n\u2018failures\u2019 and critical incidents, the prominent ones from high security settings signally\nfail to really show us how the \u2018failure\u2019 occurred or the process by which a breakdown in\nprofessional functioning developed. Jude Deacon\u2019s research aims to fill this gap in\nunderstanding, working from the assumption that the processes which explain such\nincidents are more likely everyday ones, than exceptional or aberrant.\nHere she presents data from a research participant in the institution where she\nworked at the time, to whom at the outset she was offering clinical supervision, but for\nwhom she later had also line management responsibility.\nMs A from 23 May 2005:\nMs A said that she had \u2018an issue\u2019 she would like to raise with me about a member of\nthe team. She named one of the men \u2014 a music therapist \u2014 and said that she\nthought he \u2018might have a problem with alcohol\u2019. He had been noted by various\nmembers of the team, clearly for some time, to be smelling of alcohol. She said\n\u2018I\u2019ve thought about saying to him\u2014 you regularly smell of alcohol but I thought it\nseemed confrontational. And yet, role-playing saying it to you just then, I can see\nthat it\u2019s not confrontational\u2019.\nShe confirmed that he had had a lot of sickness absence and also had appalling\ntimekeeping. In the past, before she was acting-up, \u2018we used to joke about it all the\ntime\u2014 \u201cwhere\u2019s Z?\u201d\u2019 He would not turn in for work and not contact the dept. She\nknew that he was living in N. London and would always get held up in traffic \u2014\narrive at lunchtime. She used to think \u2018why doesn\u2019t he just leave earlier?\u2019 She also\nknows that he works as a jazz musician at nights. There have been occasions when\nhe has come to work smelling of alcohol and has clearly not been to bed. The\ntimekeeping has improved somewhat since he got a room in the nurses hostel on\nsite. But there are still issues. One of the other men had recently refused to share\nan office with him \u2018because he always stinks\u2019. Although the colleague had not\nspecified alcohol, she knew that was what he meant.\nEMOT IONAL AND EP ISTEMOLOG ICAL CHALLENGES 4 33\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n7:2\n1 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \nMs A from 22 June 2005\n. . . Ms A was also proposing to the team that she be enabled to contact tutors to\nconfirm their attendance when they attended external courses for Continuing\nProfessional Development. One team member (Z) had claimed regular TOIL for\nattendance at a course. However, a colleague, on the same course, had alerted Ms\nA to the fact that Z\u2019s attendance had been poor. This person had passed with flying\ncolours but Z had been granted a year\u2019s extension on his final assignment . . .\n. . . She spoke again of Z\u2019s absences, saying that it was funny that the rest of the\nteam spoke so little to her about these absences now. In the past, before she was\nacting head of the dept, the subject of Z\u2019s absences was \u2018a standing joke\u2019 \u2014 they\nwere always joking about the fact that Z \u2018was never there \u2014 \u201cwhere\u2019s Z? Don\u2019t\nknow!\u201d\u2019 She recalled a time, when he had only recently joined the team, and he\nwas found asleep in the music therapy room. Her predecessor had dealt with it . . .\nA small section of the researcher\u2019s analysis of these data reads as follows:\nIt is clear from her descriptions that over a substantial period of time the team had\ngrown accustomed to colluding with Z\u2019s behaviour. In a collective denial of the\nseriousness and potential consequences of such behaviour, they \u2018used to joke about it\nall the time\u2019. Indeed it had become \u2018a standing joke\u2019 that they are collectively holding\nas a secret: a dangerous secret. The risk and ethical implications of the member of\nstaff smelling of alcohol and indeed quite possibly being intoxicated or otherwise\nincapable of effective work were completely absent from the material as were any\nreferences to the clear breaches of trust policies or the code of conduct required by\nthe Health Professions Council with whom arts therapists maintain professional\nregistration. Similarly, she does not acknowledge the aggression and denial of\nreality implicit in his behaviour. It would seem that Z\u2019s potential risk is not taken\nseriously. In response (see below) I felt it necessary to introduce this framework of\nboundaries into the sessions, to clarify her role in this regard and to be prescriptive\nwith her as to what actions she should take in order to avoid the service being\nfurther compromised by this man both in the short and long terms.\nDeacon (2009)\n(2) Losing our minds\nIn research that is truly \u2018practice near\u2019, we risk losing a clear sense of where the\nboundary lies between ourselves and other people. We also see this in our observations\nof research subjects \u2014 for example, that they may often appear to be ensnared in\nrepetitive, destructive dynamics with one another in which it\u2019s clear that individuals\nare actually parts of a psychic or psycho-social system, or they may be lost in some kind\nof mutual idealisation in which each is needed by the other to sustain the illusion of\nadmiration; but we too will experience it in our relationship as researchers to our\nresearch subjects. An apparently stray, unbidden but powerful thought or memory\nsuddenly enters our awareness, related to what we are observing or discussing in an\ninterview, but also clearly our thought. Or is it so clear? Why, at that precise moment,\nJOURNAL OF SOC IAL WORK PRACT ICE43 4\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n7:2\n1 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \nthat particular thought? Here we are in the territory explored by the psychoanalyst\nThomas Ogden in his work on the nature, experience, and meaning of the therapist\u2019s\n\u2018reverie\u2019 in clinical sessions (Ogden, 1999). Ultimately he evokes an idea of the\npatient\u2013analyst pair creating a kind of \u2018psychic field\u2019 both unconscious and conscious,\nbetween them. Thus, particular \u2018reveries\u2019 do have a meaning that extends beyond the\nindividual, and can in Ogden\u2019s view be used to access aspects of unconscious\nexperience in the patient.\nIn her study of three front line social work teams, Judy Foster (2009) makes use of\nthis kind of recording and interpretation of her own emotional experience; but she also\ncites a cautionary passage from Christopher Bollas (1987) about the status of \u2018counter-\ntransference experiences\u2019:\nCounter-transference readiness creates an internal space which allows for a more\ncomplete and articulate expression of the patient\u2019s transference speech than if I\nwere to close down this internal space and replace it with some ideal notion of\nabsolute mental neutrality or scientific detachment (p. 202) . . . This inevitable,\never-present, and necessary uncertainty about why we feel as we do gives to our\nprivate ongoing consideration of the counter-transference a certain humility and\nresponsibility (p. 203).\nIn her presentation and discussion of her lengthy series of observations and interviews\nwith a hospital social work team, there are the following passages:\nDesolation and despair\nThere was one old lady like a little sparrow who had pushed her chair out so as to\ncatch people as they walked by the end of her bed, repeating \u2018Are you the Doctor? I\nwant to go home\u2019 in the most distressing way. Her cotton robe was hanging open at\nthe chest and I felt very confused as to whether to stop and straighten it for her. But\nwhat would I do when she clung to me? And would that make it worse? I walked on\nto the meeting room, disturbed by the scene and my feelings (Visit 5H).\nOn the following day I returned with Gail (one of the social workers) to a ward\nwith twenty eight beds for older people who had suffered strokes. I was assailed by\nthe sense of desolation and despair. The meeting did nothing to alleviate this since\nonly the consultant and the ward doctor spoke. The other nine participants sat\nsilently for two hours. Therewas no attempt to develop a rapport between staff or to\nuse the meeting to explore problems and dilemmas. The oppressive attitude of the\nconsultant seemed to mirror the repression of any life and individuality in the\npatients. Perhaps signs of life would lead to more despair by patients, which staff\nwere not equipped to tolerate. Perhaps the staff\u2019s confusion on the best way forward\nwould be the same as mine? I spent the time preoccupied, worried that my father-in-\nlawwas in a similar ward. My notes were as monosyllabic and lifeless as themeeting.\nA personal interlude\nMy personal situation was entwined with the placement and influenced my\nperceptions of it. My elderly parents-in-law were reaching the end of their long\nEMOT IONAL AND EP ISTEMOLOG ICAL CHALLENGES 4 35\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n7:2\n1 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \nlives. They lived in their own home with some daily help for my father-in-law.\nWhen he could no longer climb the stairs, he was admitted to the local hospital for\nassessment. After the second MDT meeting referred to above, I visited him the\nnext day. We had a remarkable talk. This consoled us when he died suddenly the\nfollowing morning. I stopped my placement for two weeks for the funeral and\nreturned for the month of February, conscious of another break in relation to the\nteam. In my last week, my mother-in-law was living alone for the first time in her\nlife, with the prospect of all her children being out of contact for the following\nweek. We were all preoccupied and anxious as to how we could help her \u2018hold it\ntogether\u2019.\nOn my penultimate day there I had an unpleasant sense of vertigo as I left the\noffice. It was as if I was on the edge of a cliff or volcano and everything was falling\naway around me. Was it too much pressure and rush? Or was it my mother-in-\nlaw\u2019s situation? I did not know. I wanted to distance myself from the hospital and\nall that it stood for. The next day I learnt that the last remaining manager was not\nreturning from sick leave. My sense of vertigo had related to the team \u2014 its\nmanagement really was falling apart.\n(Foster, 2009)\n(3) The inevitability of change\nPractice-near research changes the researcher, and may change or transform research\nsubjects. In so far as the research act is itself an interpretive one, in which the \u2018truth\u2019 of\nthe data is in part dependent on the interpretive framework of the researcher, there can\neven be a meaningful sense in which \u2018reality itself\u2019 is transformed in the process of the\nresearch; but for this to happen, the researcher herself may (no, will . . . ) have to\nundergo a parallel transformation.\nIn her paper \u2018Projective processes on the front line\u2019, Sylvia Smith (2007) describes\na research consultation interview, her subsequent research journal reflections on this\ninterview, and then a process in which she suddenly \u2018saw the data differently\u2019. She\nlikens this to what the psychoanalyst Wilfred Bion called a shift in \u2018vertex\u2019.\nThe data episode in question is dense, but I will do my best to encapsulate it.\nIt concerns an account given in a research consultation session by two social work\nmanagers of a children\u2019s centre, a sequence of events involving (a) a black male service\nuser who was the father of (b) a baby girl with whom he has \u2018contact sessions\u2019 at the\ncentre where the research was undertaken. During contact session 1, (c) a white social\nworker and (d) a white deputy project manager are reported to have found the service\nuser angry and intimidating and as a result his contact is terminated. His contact is\nlater re-instated by (e) the black project manager and (f) a new black deputy project\nmanager.\nAt contact session 2, a centre worker (g) challenged the service user because he\npersistently removed the bottle from his daughter\u2019s mouth as she was feeding; during\nthis contact session (h) the baby\u2019s black Children\u2019s Guardian arrived (seemingly\nunexpectedly) and at more or less the same time the black deputy project manager (f)\nalso entered the room. Later the Guardian reportedly commented to the deputy\nJOURNAL OF SOC IAL WORK PRACT ICE43 6\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n7:2\n1 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \nmanager that \u2018had she been alone in the room with the service user, he would have\nprobably attacked her\u2019 (2007, p. 211).\nFollowing contact session 1, the deputy manager had (i) met the service user who\nseems to have acknowledged that he had been \u2018intimidating\u2019 to centre staff; however,\n(ii) the deputy manager had suggested to him that he had not been intimidating or\naggressive but merely disputed the arrangements in some way; and (iii) had\nsubsequently talked to the white centre worker who had agreed that \u2018with hindsight the\nservice user had not in fact been hostile or aggressive, but that perhaps with hindsight\nthe worker\u2019s anxiety and hysteria about what could potentially have happened had\nbeen fuelled by the service user\u2019s non-responsiveness to centre staff on that day . . . \u2019\n(2007, p. 210).\nIn her commentary, Smith describes how in the research consultation\nAs a black person hearing this account from another black person, I strongly\nidentified with all the thoughts and feelings of the service user about being\nmisunderstood as a race of people by white professionals. As the Deputy manager\nshared this account there was a shared \u2018understanding\u2019 among the three of us as\nblack people, in terms of the ease with which we are often perceived as \u2018aggressive\nand intimidating\u2019.\n(Smith, 2007, p. 211)\nHowever, as she reviews her written data record, Smith begins to see the\n\u2018interpretation\u2019 of events implied in the above commentary in a different light. She\nwonders whether it might not be quite plausible that the service user became angry; she\nwonders whether the centre worker might have found it difficult to challenge the\ndeputy manager\u2019s interpretation of events at contact session 1 \u2018for fear of being accused\nof racism\u2019; and she suggests that in contact session 2 the Guardian \u2018could clearly see the\ndanger, but we (deputy manager, project manager and I) were more preoccupied with\nthe Guardian\u2019s remarks and how misunderstood this service user was and how unjustly\nhe had been perceived\u2019 (2007, p. 211).\nBut this \u2018shift of perspective\u2019 is not a consequence just of \u2018rational reflection\u2019, or\nsystematic \u2018reanalysis\u2019 of the data. Something else intervenes, and Smith says:\nI recalled an incident which took place some time ago when I was a team manager\n. . . During a very busy day I had joined a member of staff to support her with a\nvery angry client and his partner in an interview room. They were a black couple.\nThe service user was a black man who had become very verbally abusive in the\nmeeting and seemed to channel most of his anger towards me. I remained quite\ncalm as he shouted and \u2018ranted\u2019 on for several minutes . . . I later met with my line\nmanager to debrief about what had taken place. She immediately felt the danger in\nthe incident . . . It was only during this discussion with my line manager that it\nbegan to dawn on me the potential danger this incident presented.\n(Smith, 2007, pp. 212\u2013213)\nThis piece of analysis and reflection captures in a complex fashion several inter-\nrelated aspects of the research process. First, the data decisively does not speak for\nitself; when the researcher is in identification with her research subjects and their view\nEMOT IONAL AND EP ISTEMOLOG ICAL CHALLENGES 4 37\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n7:2\n1 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \nof the world, reality is one thing; when she questions her identifications, then the\nwhole pattern of interpretation shifts and in some respects inverts. All the evidence for\nthis revised interpretation was available first time round, but some of the facts were,\nlet\u2019s say, \u2018inconvenient\u2019; but the shift of perspective seems to be enabled or supported\nby an internal process in the researcher, a kind of \u2018reverie\u2019 in fact, that comes to her aid\nin the form of a memory of another shift in perspective involving questions of race,\naggression and dangerousness. Perhaps it is significant that the recollected incident\ninvolves a seemingly trusted black manager; but whatever the case this figure is the one\nthe researcher now identifies with, and who represents the capacity for her to \u2018observe\nher own research ego\u2019 and take up a \u2018third position\u2019 with respect to the data.\nAnalysis like this brings me closer to an understanding of some of the most often\nquoted lines in English literature, from T.S. Eliot\u2019s Four Quartets: \u2018Time present and\ntime past \/ are both perhaps present in time future \/ and time future contained in time\npast\u2019 (Eliot, 1962). This is a view of the nature of reality far from compatible with\n\u2018proper science\u2019 and its methods and assumptions about linear causality. The only\nquestion for me is how seriously do we take this more mysterious conception of social\nreality? And do we have the courage to really fight for its legitimacy in our professional\ndealings?\nMaybe this is also the right point to note something that has been implicit\nthroughout most of what I have said so far \u2014 emotional experience and epistemology\nseem to me to be inextricably entangled in this kind of research. I think the\nconventional view about sound research methodology is that it protects the\nresearch(er) from the distorting influence of his or her subjectivity and emotional\nresponses; good practice-near research seems to me to depend upon subjectivity and\nemotional engagement with the object of research. What then can safeguard us against\nthe prejudices and distortions of the researcher\u2019s passions? I think it can only be the\nkind of mental and emotional flexibility that Sylvia Smith\u2019s example illustrates, and\nwhich convinces us because of the depth of analysis it supports.\nCertain kinds of research \u2014 notably action research \u2014 set out to effect change in\nthe subjects being researched, but there is a good deal of evidence that the kind of work\nI have been presenting may create change in ways that cannot be planned, anticipated\nor contracted for.\nAnother of Jude Deacon\u2019s research participants was a police child protection\nofficer, who volunteered to engage in a series of consultative interviews about his\nwork. The hope was that this might provide depth insight into the kinds of\npsychological pressures exerted by suspects with a great deal to lose, on someone\ncarrying authority and responsibility for getting at the truth of their actions. And so it\nproved I think, but over the months we realised that another process was at work, in\nwhich the meaning of the consultations for the research participant seemed to involve a\ngradual awareness or acceptance that he found this work intolerable.\nDC B from 26 July 2005:\nHe said that it had been a \u2018really strange\u2019 few weeks. He thought that things had\n\u2018been getting on top\u2019 of him \u2014 then he had been ill for 2 weeks \u2014 he had been to\na barbeque & got food poisoning followed by an infection \u2014 and then he had had a\nweek\u2019s pre-booked leave. He spoke of the nature of our work, saying that he felt\nJOURNAL OF SOC IAL WORK PRACT ICE43 8\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n7:2\n1 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \n\u2018relatively comfortable\u2019 talking to sex offenders but that there were other aspects\nof the work that were more difficult. One of his colleagues had told him about a\njob she was working on. It was a case of neglect of a young baby. The child had\nbeen so badly neglected that it had resorted to eating its own faeces. DC B had\nfound this very difficult to deal with. Again he said that things seemed to have got\non top of him a little . . .\nDC B from 6 December 2005:\nHe had been speaking to a female colleague in their office when something she said\n(either he didn\u2019t tell me or, as I write this up, I cannot recall what it was that she\nsaid) made him \u2018blub\u2019, tears streaming down his face. \u2018You bitch\u2019, he said to her. I\nasked him where that had come from (\u2018you bitch\u2019) \u2014 was it not entirely\nunderstandable that he would be moved by such a perverse crime? He said that he\nthought it might have been because it was in front of all their team. He then moved\nvery swiftly on saying \u2018and then I got a job that really did make me cry\u2019 . . .\n. . . DC B had then gone home. He was sitting with his young son whom he said\nis \u2018not usually a very demonstrative child\u2019. His son had suddenly flung his arms\naround him and DC B had found himself moved to tears. He had excused himself\nfrom his son saying he would go and get him a drink. He then went outside until he\ncould compose himself. He said that he didn\u2019t want to have to explain to his son\nwhy he was crying.\nDC B from 6 December 2005:\nDC B then said he felt he\u2019d had enough and couldn\u2019t take any more. He laughed as\nhe said it but said that he thought if he \u2018had to hear one more thing about\nsomeone\u2019s willy or someone\u2019s bum . . . \u2019 He had to get away from it for a bit. \u2018So I\nwent off on my mountain bike. Actually, no . . . I went surfing for a couple of\ndays.\u2019\n(Deacon, 2009)\nNot long afterwards this man asked to be transferred to another kind of police work.\nBoth the researcher and I had a strong feeling that the research sessions played a part in\nallowing his defences against the disturbing and painful impact of this work to slowly\nbreak down. Perhaps he volunteered for the research because he sensed he needed a\ncontext to help him work this through. Whatever, the data from the sessions provide a\nrich picture of a worker poised on a kind of knife edge \u2014 on the one hand almost\nalways in touch with the emotional realities and forensic significance of what he is\nhearing \u2014 the denial, contradictions, deceit, self-deceit, the sudden effort to throw an\ninterviewer off the scent \u2014 and on the other a man suffering from the damaging\nexposure to too much perversity and malevolence.\n(4) The complexity of particulars\nThe closer we come to the raw emotional, relationship-based, turbulent, messy visceral\ndata of practice, the more I think that the fact of the \u2018complexity of particulars\u2019 forces\nEMOT IONAL AND EP ISTEMOLOG ICAL CHALLENGES 4 39\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n7:2\n1 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \nitself on our attention. To really understand and capture in adequate concepts and\nformulations the character, meaning and broader significance of the very specific,\nparticular people, families, organisational processes we are studying requires a terrific\neffort of emotional and methodological will-power. I have a special aversion to\nqualitative research in which lots of people are interviewed, and then the research is\nwritten in up in loosely themed groupings of quotations from the research subjects. Any\neffort to interrogate the meaning of these utterances further is usually met with a\ndefensive insistence that \u2018What we have presented is what these people are telling us\u2019\u2014\nthe unspoken part of the communication being \u2018So, bugger off with your clever\ninterpretations, that are in fact your own oppressive distortions of these people\u2019s real\nexperience they have so generously shared\u2019.\nOf course, there are very real and serious questions about how the research act can\nauthentically capture the experience and meanings of the \u2018other\u2019 without as it were\nengaging in an act of \u2018othering\u2019; but I am clear that we desperately need our social work\nresearch to provide us with in-depth understanding of our complex psycho-social world.\nA key lesson from doing practice-near research is thus that each and every situation or context\nis unique and particular, and must be understood \u2014 \u2018apprehended\u2019 in its own terms. Its character\nor meaning cannot be \u2018read off\u2019, or deduced from some set of abstract principles.\nI can now say a bit more about the bigger world view I suggest practice-near\nresearch partakes of; the dynamics shaping the everyday psycho-social world are\ncreative, constantly combining elements of human capacities and functioning in original,\nnew, unfamiliar ways to produce \u2018complex particulars\u2019. Sometimes, this \u2018creativity\u2019 is\nin the service of deadly and destructive ends \u2014 no two children are abused in exactly\nthe same way. But of course this is not the end of the story \u2014 the strong family\nresemblances, or ingrained and repetitive patterns in human individual, group,\norganisational or social life are not just the additive result of particulars that resemble\none another being subsequently grouped by minds that recognise similarity. Patterns\nand resemblances must be the product of structuring, or patterning, or law-like\nprinciples at work somewhere, but these are what I think we have less idea about \u2014\nthough again it is possible to indicate where others have explored the territory.\nAnthony Giddens\u2019 theoretical work on how society is constituted and reproduces\nitself tried to create a space between sociological determinism and sociological\nindividualism; neither absolute free \u2018agency\u2019 of the social subject, nor total social\nstructuring of the subject either. This resulted in his profound if clumsily named theory\nof \u2018structuration\u2019 (Giddens, 1979, 1984). The critical realist post-Marxist philosophical\ntradition led by the work of Roy Bhaskar is another theoretical resource (Archer et al.,\n1998), articulating a kind of surface and depth model of social processes in which\nknowable social phenomena are produced by generative deep structural principles.\nHearing the grass grow\nIf we had a keen vision and feeling of all ordinary human life, it would be like\nhearing the grass grow and the squirrel\u2019s heart beat and we should die of that roar\nwhich lies on the other side of silence.\n(George Eliot, Middlemarch, p. 226)\nJOURNAL OF SOC IAL WORK PRACT ICE44 0\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n7:2\n1 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \nThe police constable presented earlier appeared to be gradually overcome by the roar\nthat lies on the other side of silence. As for him, the dilemma of practice-near research\nreflects the predicament of social work in society \u2014 how much reality can we bear to\nknow about? I suggested at the outset that a central social function of social work is\nboth to disclose forms of suffering to society via engagement with them, and\nsimultaneously to protect society from too much painful awareness of the ugly facts\nthat are constantly in our midst. I suppose someone might object that not all social\nwork is as concerned with painful, ugly, perverse, toxic, intractable realities as I have\npainted it to be. This could be right, but my response would be that the easier bits of\nsocial work are perhaps not the ones that really need our urgent attention. If as\nresearchers we don\u2019t have the courage to try to engage with the most unwelcome\naspects of our professional task, then I think we are failing in our responsibilities to our\npractitioner colleagues. This reflects a more general conviction of mine that is no doubt\nrecognisably psychoanalytic \u2014 that the power of the destructive and the negative is\nreduced or attenuated through fearless engagement with it and recognition of its\nnature; thereby we can be released into greater freedom, creativity and even happiness.\nOften we can\u2019t find the resources or courage to manage this, and so we tend to be\ncondemned to repeat or hand on our miseries. Progress in human affairs may be slow\nbut that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t real, and that it doesn\u2019t need all our renewed efforts to\nsustain it. Good practice-near research is a contribution to this effort.\nAcknowledgements\nI would like to acknowledge my gratitude to the three doctoral students who gave\npermission to have their work cited in this paper. Some of this work is still in progress\nand therefore possibly subject to change before publication in the public domain.\nNote\n1 \u2018Baby P\u2019 or Baby Peter as he is now known, was a toddler who was tortured to death\nin his family home in North London in 2007. When details of the case became public\nknowledge in December 2008, it gave rise to a period of intense political and public\nreaction. Social work and social workers became the object of fierce criticism,\npublic interrogation and personal threats.\nReferences\nArcher, M., Bhaskar, R., Collier, A., Lawson, T. & Norrie, A.
