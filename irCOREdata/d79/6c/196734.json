In addition to performing a variety of functions \nduring mitotic growth, Exo1 is also important for the production of crossovers during \nmeiosis.  However, its precise molecular role has remained ambiguous and several \nmodels have been proposed to account for the crossover deficit observed in its \nabsence.  Here, we present physical evidence that the nuclease activity of Exo1 is \nessential for normal 5\uf0a2-3\uf0a2 resection at the Spo11-dependent HIS4 hotspot in otherwise \nwild-type cells.  This same activity was also required for normal levels of gene \nconversion at the locus.  However, gene conversions were frequently observed at a \ndistance beyond that at which resection was readily detectable arguing that it is not \nthe extent of the initial DNA end resection that limits heteroduplex formation.  In \naddition to these nuclease-dependent functions, we found that an exo1-D173A mutant \ndefective in nuclease activity is able to maintain crossing-over at wild-type levels in a \nnumber of genetic intervals, suggesting that Exo1 also plays a nuclease-independent \nrole in crossover promotion. \n \nKeywords: EXO1, meiosis, recombination, resection, double-strand break. \n \n \n1. Introduction \nDuring meiosis, recombination is initiated by the formation of DNA double-strand \nbreaks (DSBs) catalysed by the Spo11 protein [1].  Once DSB formation has been \nachieved, Spo11 must be removed from the DNA ends in order for repair to \ncommence.  This removal takes place via endonucleolytic cleavage of the DNA to \nrelease Spo11-oligonucleotide complexes [2].  Further DNA end resection then \nfollows resulting in longer 3\uf0a2 overhanging strands [3, 4].  These strands are bound by \nRad51 and Dmc1 to form the recombinogenic nucleoprotein filaments required to \ncatalyse strand-invasion [5]. \n \nDSBs may be repaired to yield either crossovers or non-crossovers and it is thought \nthat the decision as to which repair pathway is utilised is made at or around the point \nof strand invasion.  The stabilisation of a nascent D-loop to form a single-end \ninvasion (SEI) is the first molecularly measurable event that defines the major \ncrossover pathway [6].  Subsequently, double Holliday junctions (dHJs) are produced \n[7, 8], resolution of which by an as yet unidentified factor(s) yields a crossover.  A \nnumber of proteins are required for this process [9] including the Msh4\/Msh5 \nheterodimer [10, 11], which is believed to encircle and stabilise D-loop and Holliday \njunction structures [12] and the Mlh1\/Mlh3 heterodimer.  Mlh1\/Mlh3 are thought to \nfunction after Msh4\/Msh5 and may be required (either directly or indirectly) for \nHolliday junction resolution [13-17].  A minority of crossovers also form \nindependently of the Msh4\/Msh5 pathway, many of which are dependent upon the \nstructure-specific endonuclease complex Mus81\/Mms4 [18-20].  While physically \ndetectable intermediates specific to the non-crossover pathway have not been \nidentified, it is thought likely to proceed via synthesis-dependent strand-annealing \n[21, 22].  The initiating events in this pathway are similar to those in the crossover \npathway; however, a detectable SEI intermediate is not produced.  Instead, following \nDNA synthesis, the invading strand is displaced and anneals to the complementary \nsequence uncovered by resection on the opposite side of the DSB.  DNA synthesis \nthen acts to fill in the remaining gaps, followed by ligation of the DNA ends. \n \nExo1 (a member of the Rad2\/XPG family of nucleases) possesses both 5\uf0a2-3\uf0a2 \nexonuclease and 5\uf0a2 flap endonuclease activities [23] and has been shown to be \ninvolved in a wide variety of cellular processes during mitotic growth.  In yeasts [24-\n26], Drosophila [27] and mice [28], expression of Exo1 is strongly up-regulated in \ncells undergoing meiosis suggesting an important conserved role for Exo1 during the \nrecombination process.  To date, the most comprehensive analyses concerning the \nmeiotic role of Exo1 have been carried out in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  In \nthis organism, crossing-over was shown to be reduced 1.5-2 fold in exo1\uf044 strains \ncompared to wild type [25, 29, 30].  Consequently, increased levels of meiosis I non-\ndisjunction occurred resulting in the formation of aneuploid spores.  Compared to any \nsingle mutant, no further reduction in crossing-over was observed in exo1\uf044 msh4\uf044 or \nexo1\uf044 msh5\uf044 double mutants suggesting that Exo1 acts to promote inter-homologue \ncrossing-over via the Msh4\/Msh5 pathway [29, 30].   \n \nThese studies also indicated that deletion of EXO1 confers allele and\/or locus specific \neffects on gene conversion [29, 30].  While Tsubouchi et al. [25] were unable to \ndetect any reduction in gene conversion at ARG4 or the artificial HIS4:LEU2 hotspot \nusing recombination assays between heteroalleles, Khazanehdari & Borts [30] \nreported a significant two-fold reduction in gene conversion at all four alleles of HIS4 \nstudied.  They also noted an approximately two-fold reduction in conversion at two \nalleles of MET13 and at one of the three LEU2 alleles tested.  Conversely, Kirkpatrick \net al. [29] reported no effect on the gene conversion of markers at HIS4 but did \nobserve a significant reduction at ARG4.  As gene conversion requires the \nincorporation of allelic markers into heteroduplex DNA (hDNA) [31], Exo1 may \ntherefore be required for the formation or extension of hDNA tracts.  In view of these \nresults and the biochemical function of Exo1 as a nuclease, it has been suggested that \nExo1 functions in the resection of meiotic DSBs prior to strand invasion [25, 30].  \nThis has been demonstrated recently at mitotic DSBs [32, 33].   \n \nTo date, experiments designed to demonstrate a direct role for Exo1 in meiotic \nresection have relied upon deletion of DMC1 to aid the visualisation of resection \nintermediates on Southern blots [25, 34].  In the absence of DMC1, breaks are unable \nto undergo strand invasion and hyper-resected DSBs accumulate [35].  While these \nstudies demonstrated that Exo1 is partially responsible for the hyper-resection \nobserved, it remains unclear as to what extent this reflects normal patterns of \nresection.  Additionally, there is uncertainty as to how Exo1 acts to promote crossing-\nover.  It has been proposed that decreased resection following DSB formation may \nreduce the stability of initial strand invasion attempts, resulting in fewer SEIs being \nformed [30].  However, observations from mice indicate that when Exo1 is absent, \nmeiotic defects only become apparent at a later stage (after the crossover function of \nMsh4\/Msh5)[36, 37].  This argues that a reduction in resection may not account for \nthe crossover deficit observed and that Exo1 may have an alternative critical function \nduring meiosis. \n \nIn this work, we aimed to determine whether or not Exo1 is required for normal \nresection following Spo11-catalysed DSB formation in otherwise wild-type cells.  We \nfurther sought to test the hypothesis that resection tract length correlates with hDNA \nformation and ultimately determines the propensity with which a DSB is repaired to \nyield a crossover.  To do this we employed both physical and genetic methods of \nanalysis, focussing upon the natural HIS4 hotspot, where Exo1 has previously been \nimplicated in DSB processing [30]. \n \n2. Materials and Methods \n2.1 Yeast strains and media \nAll strains are derivatives of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae SK1 isolate [38].  The \nalleles used have been described previously [19, 39-43] and were introduced by \ntransformation or crossing to existing strains.  The EXO1 ORF was replaced with the \nkanMX4 cassette conferring resistance to geneticin as described by Wach et al. [44] \nusing the plasmid template pFA6-kanMX4.  The exo1-D173A mutation was \nintroduced via a PCR-based allele replacement method [45] using plasmid template \npEAM71 [46].  All alleles were confirmed by PCR, restriction digest and linkage \nanalysis where appropriate.  The exo1-D173A mutation was confirmed by DNA \nsequencing.  Full strain genotypes are listed in Tables 1 and 2.  The media used have \nbeen described previously [47]. \n \n2.2 Liquid sporulation \nFor tetrad analysis, haploid strains were mixed and allowed to mate for 4 hours on \nYPD at 30\uf0b0C before being replicated to minimal medium (supplemented with 240 \uf06dl \nof 0.5% (w\/v) adenine hemisulphate per plate) to select for diploids and grown \novernight at 30\uf0b0C.  For the physical analysis and random spore experiments, pure \ndiploid colonies were used.  Sporulation conditions were the same for all experiments.  \nCultures were grown to saturation in YPD, diluted 1:400 into SPS (supplemented with \n40mg\/ml adenine hemisulphate) and grown to a cell density of 5.5 x 10\n7\n cells\/ml.   \nCells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once in 2% (w\/v) potassium acetate \n(pH 7) and finally resuspended in 2% (w\/v) potassium acetate (pH 7) in 1.5 x the \nvolume of SPS used.  These cultures were transferred to a 2.8 L baffled flask and \nincubated with vigorous shaking at 23\uf0b0C.  23\uf0b0C was chosen as the sporulation \ntemperature as gene conversion and DSBs at the HIS4 hotspot have been shown to be \ntemperature-dependent, occurring at a higher frequency at lower temperatures [47, \n48].  For DNA analysis, aliquots were removed (25 ml up to 5 hours and 15 ml \nthereafter) and 10% (w\/v) sodium azide added to a final concentration of 0.1% (w\/v) \nbefore harvesting by centrifugation and storing of the cell pellets at -80\uf0b0C.  For tetrad \nand random spore analysis, cell samples were taken after 24 hours sporulation and \nprocessed immediately. \n \n2.3 Genetic analysis \nTetrad dissection and analysis was carried out as described previously [49].  Crossing-\nover and gene conversion (6:2, 2:6 segregation) was assessed in tetrads with four \nviable spores.  Tetrads exhibiting three or more non-Mendelian segregation events \n(any segregation pattern other than 4:4) were scored as false tetrads and excluded \nfrom further analysis.  Map distances in centiMorgans (cM) were calculated as \ndescribed by Perkins et al. [50].  Random spores were prepared according to the \nprotocol outlined by Jessop et al. [51] and appropriate dilutions were plated out onto \ntwo types of media: synthetic complete and synthetic complete lacking histidine, both \nof which were supplemented with 60 \uf06dg\/ml canavanine and 10 \uf06dg\/ml cyclohexamide.  \nThe double drug selection ensured that only haploid meiotic products were analysed.  \nSpores were incubated at 30\uf0b0C for 3 days before individual colonies were patched \nonto YPD.  Following growth overnight at 30\uf0b0C, the patches were replicated to YPD \nsupplemented with either 300 \uf06dg\/ml hygromycin B or 100 \uf06dg\/ml nourseothricin.  \nAfter a further overnight incubation at 30\uf0b0C, patches were scored for their ability to \ngrow on these plates.  Statistical comparisons were made using either the G-test of \nhomogeneity or the t-test as appropriate and the Dunn-Sidak correction for multiple \ntesting was applied [52].  This guards against type 1 errors but increases the \nprobability of type 2 errors. \n \n2.4 Loss of restriction site analysis by qPCR \nIn order to measure resection intermediates without having to rely upon the use of the \ndmc1\uf044 mutation or an artificial hotspot, we modified an assay developed by Hodgson \net al. [53] that measures single-stranded DNA (ssDNA).  This assay uses restriction \nenzyme digestion to cleave all double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) at a specific target \nsite, followed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) using a pair of oligonucleotide primers \ndesigned to anneal each side of the enzyme cut site.  Any DNA present at the target \nsite in single-stranded form (such as that produced by 5\uf0a2-3\uf0a2 resection) becomes \nrefractory to enzyme cleavage and is therefore able to be amplified in the subsequent \nPCR step.  A second qPCR reaction is directed to the rDNA array.  No target sites for \nany of the restriction enzymes used are present within the rDNA region chosen, \nenabling it to serve as an internal measure of the amount of DNA per reaction.  The \noligonucleotide sequences used for these experiments are given in Table 3. \n \nDNA was extracted from cells using a modified version of the CTAB method [54] in \nwhich hexamine cobalt chloride was omitted from all solutions and the DNA \nresuspended in 100-150 \uf06dl of 1x TE.  For each time point, approximately 750 ng of \ngenomic DNA was digested with 25 units of enzyme for 30 mins at 37\uf0b0C in a total \nvolume of 50 \uf06dl.  Following digestion, 20 \uf06dl of the digest was diluted into 80 \uf06dl of \nice-cold water, 2 \uf06dl of which was added to each qPCR reaction to give approximately \n6ng of template DNA per reaction.  The qPCR reactions were carried out in a total \nvolume of 10 \uf06dl using 1x SensiMix\uf0e4 SYBR (Bioline) and 400 nM forward and \nreverse oligonucleotides.  At each time point, qPCR was directed to both the target \nsite of interest and the rDNA region.  Thermocycling was carried out using a \nLightCycler\uf0e2 480 Real-Time PCR System (Roche).  PCR reactions were initiated by \nheat activation of the Taq polymerase at 95\uf0b0C for 10 mins, followed by 40 cycles of \n95\uf0b0C for 15 s and 60\uf0b0C for 1 min.  All reactions were performed in triplicate and \u201cno-\ntemplate\u201d controls for each oligonucleotide pair used were included in every run.  \nAmplicons were between 100 and 150 base pairs in length and primer specificity was \nvalidated by melt-curve analysis.  Standard curves were included on every plate and \nwere constructed from a five-point 1 in 10 serial dilution of DNA taken from the 0 \nhour time point of the time course being analysed (starting from approximately 25 ng \ntemplate DNA per reaction).  Crossing-point (Cp) values were calculated using the \nautomated Cp-calling algorithm provided by the LightCycler\uf0e2 Analysis Software \n(based on the second derivative maximum method).  In general, the mean Cp value of \nthe three replicates was used for subsequent analysis.  However, if a single reaction \ndiffered from its duplicates by more than one Cp value, it was discarded and the mean \nCp value of the remaining two reactions used instead. \n \nMean Cp values for each triplicate sample were imported into Microsoft Excel and \nstandard curves constructed for both the target site primer pair and rDNA primer pair \nby plotting the mean Cp values obtained against the log\n10\n of the dilution factor used.  \nA line of best fit was drawn and the slope (m) and y intercept (b) of the line \ncalculated.   For each experimental sample, a value for the amount of template DNA \npresent at the start of the PCR (x) at both the target and rDNA loci were obtained by \nreference to the appropriate standard curve using the formula:  \n \n\uf0a0\uf020\nx \uf03d10\nMeanCp\uf02db\nm  \n \nThe relative proportions of ssDNA and dsDNA in the sample were then calculated \nusing the equations: \n\uf0a0\uf020\n%ssDNAMEASURED \uf03d\nxTARGET\nxrDNA\n\uf0b4100  \n\uf0a0\uf020\n%dsDNAMEASURED \uf03d100\uf02d\nxTARGET\nxrDNA\n\uf0b4100\n\uf0e9\uf020\n\uf0eb\uf020\n\uf0ea\uf020\n\uf0f9\uf020\n\uf0fb\uf020\n\uf0fa\uf020 \n \nIn order to compare between different target sites and time courses, it was necessary \nto normalise the data from each experiment to take account of the efficiency with \nwhich digestion of dsDNA had occurred.  This was done by reference to the amount \nof ssDNA measured in the 0 hour time point of that time course (where 0 hour is \nassumed to represent 100% dsDNA) using the equation: \n \n\uf0a0\uf020\n%ssDNA \uf03d%ssDNAMEASUREDINSAMPLE \uf02d\n%dsDNAMEASUREDINSAMPLE\n%dsDNAMEASUREDAT 0hr\n\uf0b4%ssDNAMEASUREDAT 0hr\n\uf0e9\uf020\n\uf0eb\uf020\n\uf0ea\uf020\n\uf0ea\uf020\n\uf0f9\uf020\n\uf0fb\uf020\n\uf0fa\uf020\n\uf0fa\uf020\n \n \nThe ssDNA values calculated provided a conservative estimate of the overall \nproportion of chromatids resected as the resected strand was unable to serve as a \ntemplate for PCR in the first amplification cycle.  \n \n2.5 Southern blot analysis \nApproximately 3 \uf06dg of genomic DNA was digested with 25 units of BglII at 37\uf0b0C for \n3.5 hours in a total volume of 80 \uf06dl.  The DNA was separated on a 0.7% agarose gel \nbefore transfer to a nylon membrane in 20x SSC and probing with an \uf061-32P radio-\nlabelled HIS4 fragment (+523 to +1,547 base-pairs, relative to the HIS4 open reading \nframe).  Hybridisation and washing was carried out as described in Allers and Lichten \n[55].  Bands were quantified using a Typhoon Phosphorimager (GE Healthcare) and \nCellQuant software.  The percentage of DSBs present in each time point was \ncalculated using the formula:  \n\uf0a0\uf020\n%DSBs\uf03d\nDSB signal\nDSB\uf02b parental signal\n\uf0e9\uf020\n\uf0eb\uf020\n\uf0ea\uf020\n\uf0f9\uf020\n\uf0fb\uf020\n\uf0fa\uf020\uf0b4100 \n \n2.6 Cumulative curves \nIn order to convert the non-cumulative DSB frequencies into cumulative curves, the \nbackground DSB signal measured at 0 hours was subtracted from each time point.  \nThe DSB lifespan in each time course was then calculated as described by Padmore et \nal. [56] by dividing the area under the non-cumulative curve by the amount of DSB \nmeasured in rad50S strains.  Subsequently, the areas between each adjacent pair of \ntime points under the noncumulative curve were divided by the lifespan of the DSB \nand the resulting values describing the proportion of total DSBs present at each time \npoint summed to produce a cumulative curve.  Cumulative curves for ssDNA were \ncalculated in the same way.  For all time courses, the lifespan of each resection \nintermediate was assumed to be equivalent to the lifespan of the DSB in the same \ntime course. \n \n3.  Results \n3.1  Resection at the natural HIS4 hotspot requires the nuclease activity of Exo1 \nDSBs at the natural HIS4 hotspot are spread over an approximately 200 bp region \nwhich centres approximately 300 bp upstream of the HIS4 start codon [42, 57] \n(Supplemental Figure 1A).  In a rad50S strain where unresected DSBs accumulate \n[43], approximately 13% of all molecules receive a DSB at HIS4 when assessed by \nSouthern blotting and this is unaffected by the status of EXO1 (Methods 2.5 and \nSupplemental Figure 1A).  There are no other DSBs within 1.3 kb upstream or 5.9 kb \ndownstream of the HIS4 ORF (Supplemental Figure 1B).  We first characterised \nresection in a wild-type strain by measuring the amount of ssDNA produced at the \nNheI, ClaI, AatII and BglII restriction sites (situated approximately 0.5 kb, 0.8 kb, \n1.25 kb and 2 kb from the HIS4 hotspot respectively) at various time points \nthroughout meiosis (Figure 1A).  This was done using a qPCR-based assay that \nspecifically amplifies ssDNA (Methods 2.4).  Attempts to measure ssDNA closer to \nthe break site were unsuccessful, perhaps due to DSBs occurring within the amplicon \nor degradation of the 3\uf0a2 end.  DSB formation at the HIS4 locus was also measured \nfrom the same time courses using quantitative Southern blot analysis and the results \nfrom these experiments are presented in Figure 1B.  In contrast to previous reports \n(based on degree of DSB \u201csmearing\u201d) in which DSBs were purported to exhibit a \nconstant degree of resection at all time points [35, 58], we observed a slight delay in \nresection reaching the sites used in this study.  Thus, a greater proportion of the DSBs \npersisting at later time points were subject to detectable resection compared to those \nin earlier time points.  This suggests that the processivity of resection in these \nexperiments is slower than has been observed previously.  There are a number of \npotential explanations for this including differences in the assays used to estimate \nresection and the temperature of sporulation.  Additionally, if the DNA\/chromatin \ncontext affects resection [53], it may be the case that the natural HIS4 locus is less \namenable to processive resection than the loci used in previous studies.   \n \nIn order to estimate the overall proportion of DSBs resected as far as each target site \nover the entire time course, cumulative curves for both DSBs and ssDNA were \nconstructed (Figures 1C, Methods 2.6).  From this we demonstrate that there is a very \nsharp resection gradient in wild-type cells, with the vast majority of resection \nterminating before reaching the AatII site (955 bp from HIS4, approximately 1.25 kb \nfrom the DSB).  As can be seen in Figure 1D, when ssDNA was measured in exo1\uf044 \ncells there was considerably less resection than in the wild type (2.3x less at 500 bp \nfrom the DSB and 5x less at the site approximately 800 bp away).  This difference is \nentirely due to loss of the nuclease activity of EXO1 as DSBs in a strain containing an \nEXO1 allele that remains structurally intact but is defective in nucleolytic activity, \nexo1-D173A [23, 46], also underwent very little resection (Figure 1B). \n \n3.2. Resection tract length does not strictly correlate with frequency of gene \nconversion \nIt has previously been proposed that EXO1 is responsible for the 5\uf0a2-3\uf0a2 resection of \nmeiotic DSBs and that a gradient of resection could contribute to the formation of \ngene conversion gradients [4, 30, 31].  Therefore, we assessed the effect that deleting \nEXO1 had on the HIS4 gene conversion gradient by tetrad dissection of strains \ncontaining alleles both proximal and distal to the DSB.  Deletion of EXO1 \nsignificantly reduced the levels of gene conversion measured at both alleles (Figure 2; \np<0.0256, G-test).  While this was similar to the effect that EXO1 deletion had upon \nthe resection gradient, there did not appear to be a direct correlation between resection \nand conversion.  This was most clearly demonstrated in the wild-type strain in which \nover one third of the gene conversion tracts that were measured 96 bp from the start \ncodon (approximately 400 bp from the DSB) also extended as far as 1,688 bp away \n(approximately 2 kb from the DSB; Figure 2).  However, despite significant quantities \nof resection being observed 500 bp from the DSB, virtually no ssDNA was detected at \nthe site of the DSB distal allele even though considerable amounts of hDNA must \nhave formed there (Figures 1 and 2).  This argues that more hDNA is produced during \nmeiosis than can be accounted for by detectable resection of the DSB.  Accordingly, \nthe slopes of the resection gradients in the region assessed were approximately 3-fold \ngreater than the slopes of the conversion gradients in both wild-type and exo1\uf044 strains \n(Figures 1D and 2). \n \nIn order to rule out the possibility that the requirement for Exo1 in gene conversion at \nHIS4 was a locus-dependent effect, we also tested the effect of exo1\uf044 at 7 other \nalleles.  There was a significant reduction in gene conversion at two of these loci \n(Table 4) when compared to wild type.  At the five other loci, gene conversion was \nalso reduced but the frequencies measured were individually too low to obtain \nstatistically significant results.  However, the probability of observing the rates of \ngene conversion at all five loci changing in the same direction in exo1\uf044 cells (ie: less \nthan wild-type) if exo1\uf044 had no effect is p=0.031 (binomial exact probability).  If we \nenlarge the group to include the four other loci, then the probability of all 9 exhibiting \nlower conversion levels in exo1\uf044 is p<0.002.  Thus in the strains used here, deletion \nof EXO1 significantly reduces gene conversion.  Furthermore, the influence of Exo1 \non heteroduplex tract length appears to be dependent upon the nucleolytic activity of \nthe enzyme as gene conversion at the his4-xho and leu2-r alleles was also \nsignificantly reduced when measured in exo1-D173A.  However, there was no \nsignificant change in the frequency of gene conversion at the 7 remaining alleles in \nthis strain, perhaps due to the numbers of tetrads assessed.  \n \n3.3 Crossovers are maintained when the nuclease activity of Exo1 is absent \nWe next sought to determine if the reduced hDNA tracts and reduced resection \nobserved in the absence of the nuclease activity of Exo1 correlated with reduced \ncrossing-over.  To do this, we analysed recombination in a range of genetic intervals \non three chromosomes (Figure 3A) in wild type, exo1\uf044 and exo1-D173A tetrads.  \nConsistent with previous studies, deletion of EXO1 resulted in a statistically \nsignificant 1.5-2 fold reduction in crossing-over in all intervals examined (Figure 3C, \nSupplemental Table 1).  This reduction in crossing-over was accompanied by a \nsignificant decrease in spore viability (Figure 3B, Supplemental Table 2) from 95.8% \nto 60.4% and a significant alteration in the distribution of viable spore tetrad classes.  \nThe exo1\uf044 spore viability measured in this work was significantly lower than that \nreported previously in the SK1 background by Tsoubouchi et al. [25].  This can be \naccounted for by the difference in the temperature of sporulation used in each study as \nincreasing temperature in exo1\uf044 strains appears to improve homologue disjunction at \nmeiosis I (Supplemental Table 2).  An effect of temperature upon spore viability has \nbeen reported previously in msh4\uf044 [59] and pch2\uf044 [60] mutants.    \n \nSurprisingly, crossing-over in exo1-D173A tetrads was significantly higher than in \nexo1\uf044 cells in all but the HIS4-LEU2 and CEN8-ARG4 intervals.  The only interval \nwith significantly reduced crossing-over in exo1-D173A cells compared to wild type \nwas LEU2-MAT (Figure 3B, Supplemental Table 1).  As there is little crossover \ndeficit in exo1-D173A cells, the crossover defect observed in the exo1\uf044 strain is \nunlikely to be due to a defect in exonuclease activity.  Instead, Exo1 may also play a \nstructural role in promoting crossing-over. Consistent with the near wild-type levels \nof crossing-over in exo1-D173A meiosis, spore viability was significantly improved \ncompared to the exo1\uf044 strain and there were fewer meiosis I non-disjunctions \n(Figures 3B, 3D; Supplemental Table 3).  However, the pattern of spore viability was \ndifferent from wild type with more tetrads containing a single dead spore (Figure 3B, \nSupplemental Table 2).  A potential explanation for this effect is discussed in 4.4 and \nillustrated in Figure 5. \n \n3.4 The relationship between hDNA tract length and crossover formation \nIn order to further investigate the apparent discordance between hDNA tract length \nand crossing-over, we sought to measure the association of crossing-over with gene \nconversion at the HIS4 hotspot.  Ideally, one would use tetrad analysis to identify \ngene conversions at alleles placed varying distances from the DSB and determine the \nfrequency with which they are associated with crossing-over.  However, due to the \nrelatively low frequency of gene conversion at the distal allele used (his4-bgl) such an \napproach was not feasible.  In order to obtain sufficient gene conversions to \naccurately assess crossover association, we instead designed a random spore assay \nbased on his4 heteroalleles and selected His\n+\n prototrophic recombinants.  We \nconstructed two heteroallelic diploids: his4-xho\/his4-cla and his4-cla\/his4-bgl (Figure \n4).  In systems such as this one, the majority of His\n+\n prototrophs derive from \nrecombination events in which the hDNA tract or the mismatch repair tract terminates \nbetween the two alleles (Supplemental Figure 2).  Thus, His\n+\n prototrophs arising from \nthe his4-xho\/his4-cla heteroalleles require hDNA to extend past his4-xho but \nterminate prior to reaching the his4-cla allele and are therefore \u201eshort\u201f. In contrast, \nprototrophs from a his4-cla\/his4-bgl diploid come from \u201elong\u201f events terminating \nafter his4-cla but before his4-bgl.  \n \nWe selected 600 His\n+\n prototrophs from wild-type, exo1\uf044 and exo1-D173A strains \ncontaining these two pairs of heteroalleles.  The association of each event with \ncrossing-over was determined by the arrangement of the flanking markers.  Like all \nsuch assays (for example, that of Martini et al. [39]), one of the two possible \nrecombinants and one of the two potential parental configurations are favoured due to \nthe placement of the heteroalleles and the nature of the selection (Supplemental \nFigure 2).  For example, since the parental strand undergoing DSB formation is the \nrecipient of information, His\n+\n events in the his4-cla\/his4-bgl cross preferentially arise \nwhen the his4-cla strand is broken.  This leads to the selective recovery of His\n+\n Nat\nR\n-\nHyg\nR\n non-crossover recombinants and His\n+\n Nat\nR\n crossover recombinants. Similarly in \nthe his4-xho\/his4-cla cross, prototrophs arise predominantly when the his4-xho strand \nis broken resulting in His\n+\n non-crossovers that are drug sensitive and crossovers that \nare Nat\nS\n Hyg\nR\n (Table 5, Supplemental Figure 2). \n \nIn addition to the gene conversion events, the configuration of flanking markers was \nalso analysed in 600 spores without first selecting for histidine prototrophy in order to \nassess the overall rate of crossing-over in the interval. No statistically significant \ndifferences (G-test, p>0.0258) between strains were detected using this approach \nalthough the difference between the wild-type and the exo1\uf044 strain was p=0.03.   \nHowever, the pattern of crossing-over measured (Table 6) mirrored that observed by \ntetrad analysis in the HIS4-LEU2 interval and the adjacent LEU2-MAT interval where \nexo1-D173A cells exhibited a crossover frequency intermediate between the wild-type \nand exo1\uf044 strains.  This suggests that for recombination initiating at HIS4, both the \nnuclease-dependent and independent functions of Exo1 are required for crossing-over \nto proceed as normal.  We predicted that if exo1-D173A cells were able to maintain \ncrossing-over despite reduced hDNA formation, an increase in the association of gene \nconversions with crossing-over would be evident.  Consistent with this, crossing-over \nin exo1-D173A spores was significantly increased compared to wild-type when both \n\u201eshort\u201f and \u201elong\u201f hDNA tracts were selected for (Table 5).  Furthermore, a significant \nreduction in crossover association was observed in exo1\uf044 cells compared to exo1-\nD173A when \u201eshort\u201f hDNAs had been produced.  This suggests that the non-catalytic \nfunction of Exo1 is important for ensuring that shorter hDNA tracts undergo crossing-\nover.  When longer hDNA tracts were selected for, no such reduction in association \nwas observed, arguing that intermediates containing longer hDNA tracts do not \nrequire Exo1 to be resolved into crossovers. \n \n4. Discussion \n4.1 DSB end resection is reduced when EXO1 is absent \nIn exo1\uf044, the extent to which DSBs are resected is reduced. Furthermore, the data are \nconsistent with all DSBs being resected less, rather than a subset of DSBs being \nselectively processed by Exo1.  A more severe defect was observed when ssDNA was \nmeasured approximately 800bp from the DSB compared to 500 bp, suggesting that \nthe residual resection occurring in the absence of Exo1 is less processive.  This is \nconsistent with the data of Hodgson et al. [53] based on their analysis of resection at a \nbreak induced by the VMA1-derived endonuclease (VDE).  The identity of the \nprotein(s) responsible for this remaining resection is unclear.  A recent study \ndemonstrated a role for Sgs1 and Dna2 in producing the hyper-resected intermediates \nthat form during meiosis in dmc1\u0394 mutants [34].  This is reminiscent of the dual \nresection pathways mediated by Exo1 and the 5' single-stranded exonuclease Dna2 (in \nconjunction with the helicase Sgs1 to first unwind the DNA) at DSBs occurring \nduring mitotic growth [32, 33].  However, if these same enzymes are involved in \ncatalysing normal meiotic resection, they are noticeably less able to compensate for \nExo1 during meiosis than in other phases of the cell cycle.  Indeed, a recent study of \nmeiotic resection by Zakharyevich et al. [61] demonstrated that the absence of Sgs1 \ndoes not have any significant effect upon meiotic resection tract lengths.  Therefore, \nthe most likely candidates are the structure-specific endonuclease Mre11 and\/or Sae2 \n(both of which are required for the initial endonucleolytic cleavage event that releases \nSpo11 following DSB formation [62-68]).  In support of this idea, strains containing \nmutations in SAE2 and MRE11 have been shown to exhibit resection defects at a VDE \nbreak [53, 68, 69] \n \n4.2 DNA synthesis and Exo1 may collaborate in the creation of heteroduplex \nDNA \nWhile Exo1 was shown to contribute to both gene conversion and resection at HIS4 in \nthis study, there did not appear to be a one-to-one correlation.  Specifically, gene \nconversion tracts extended much further than resection tracts, implying that DNA \nsynthesis commonly takes place beyond the point reached by resection before the \ninitial strand invasion event.  Although this finding contradicts a previous study at the \nARG4 locus in which resection and gene conversion gradients were shown to be \nsimilar [4], it is in accord with the lengths of meiotic recombination-related DNA \nsynthesis observed by Terasawa et al. [70].  By monitoring the incorporation of \nthymidine analogues during meiosis, synthesis tracts associated with a crossover were \nmeasured at 1.5 kb-1.9 kb, lengths far in excess of those estimated to occur during \nresection [4, 35, 58; this study].  We cannot rule out the possibility that rapid turnover \nof longer resection tracts prevents these intermediates from being detected.  However, \nthe apparent disparity between the amount of DNA resected and DNA synthesised \nsupports previous observations implying that it is the extent of heteroduplex made by \nthe combination of DNA synthesis and second-end capture that determines the length \nof hDNA formed during meiosis, rather than the length of ssDNA in the first SEI [6, \n51, 71, 72] (Figure 5).  \n \nNonetheless, Exo1 evidently influences hDNA tract length in some manner as its \nabsence results in significantly reduced amounts of gene conversion.  If extensive \nsynthesis past the initial resection point occurs, this may result in the formation of \nDNA flaps following capture by the resected strand on the opposite side of the DSB.  \nWe suggest that Exo1 acts either to remove these flaps or to catalyse a second phase \nof resection as DNA synthesis proceeds (Figure 5).  Such a nucleolytic activity may \nnot be detectable using our assay because it would occur within the context of \ndsDNA.  This 5\uf0a2 end removal would allow the DNA synthesised using the \nhomologous chromosome as a template to be incorporated into heteroduplex DNA on \nthe chromatid that received the DSB, thereby enabling conversion tracts to extend \nbeyond the initial resection (Figure 5).  A similar role for Exo1 was previously \npostulated by Abdullah et al.[73] and such a function fits well with the hDNA \nextension model proposed by Maloisel et al.[72].  When Exo1 is absent, some limited \nsecondary resection may be catalysed by an alternative nuclease.  This alternative 5\uf0a2 \nprocessing mechanism may also account for the observation that exo1-D173A tetrads \nexhibited a lower level of non-Mendelian segregation at the his4-xho allele than was \nobserved in exo1\uf044 cells, as substrate binding by the nucleolytically defective protein \ncould reduce the ability of any substitute nuclease to access the DNA end.   \n \nIt remains to be determined whether this second phase of resection usually occurs co-\nordinately as DNA synthesis proceeds or later, following the displacement of the \nsynthesised DNA and partial strand annealing (Figure 5).  If synthesis and resection \nare generally coordinated, it may be that synthesis itself is reduced in the absence of \nExo1.  Alternatively, the same amount of nascent DNA may be produced but upon \ncapture of the second end, a 3\uf0a2 flap could form [73].  Removal of this 3\uf0a2 flap rather \nthan assimilation of the DNA into the heteroduplex would thus result in a reduced \nhDNA tract.  Similar 3\uf0a2 flapped substrates have been shown to be an ideal substrate \nfor the Mus81\/Mms4 complex [74] and indeed a minor role for Mms4 in the removal \nof such flaps has been proposed previously to account for the increased gene \nconversion observed in mms4\uf044 strains [18, 19].  Physical analysis has also implicated \nMus81\/Mms4 in resolving aberrant recombination intermediates during meiosis [75, \n76]. \n \n4.3 A structural role for Exo1 in crossover promotion \nThe maintenance of crossing-over in exo1-D173A meiosis compared to exo1\uf044, despite \nequivalent defects in resection and hDNA formation, argues that relatively short \nresection tracts remain largely proficient for strand invasion at most loci.  Similar \nobservations have been made previously at mitotic DSBs [32, 33].  Furthermore, it \ncan be argued that dHJ formation is also largely unaffected by the reduction in \nnucleolytic processing.  In light of this and the finding that the non-catalytic function \nof Exo1 appears to be most important when short hDNA tracts have occurred, we \nsuggest that Exo1 is required to stabilise either the strand invasion structure or the \ndHJ intermediate, allowing it to be resolved as a crossover (Figure 5).  A late role for \nExo1 fits well with observations from Exo1\n-\/- \nmice in which synapsis occurs normally \nbut chiasmata are not maintained [36, 37].  The finding that crossing-over is only \nmaintained at levels intermediate between wild-type and exo1\uf044 strains in some \nintervals suggests a locus-specific requirement for the nucleolytic activity of Exo1 in \nsome regions of the genome. The basis for this is unclear; perhaps at some loci, more \nextensive resection is essential to guarantee stable strand invasion.  Alternatively, \nthese sites may be more prone to unwinding of crossover-designated intermediates \nthan others, an activity which could be exacerbated by the shorter hDNA tracts seen \nin exo1-D173A cells.   \n \nExo1 has previously been suggested to act in a nuclease-independent manner during \nmitotic DNA mismatch repair (MMR).  This function requires Exo1 to physically \ninteract with Mlh1 [77].  A five amino acid motif R\/S-S-K-(Y\/F)-F known as the \nMlh1 interacting protein (MIP) box in Exo1 mediates this interaction by binding a \nconserved S2 motif in Mlh1 [77, 78].  The physical presence of Exo1 was proposed to \nbe important for the stabilisation of the Mlh1 and Pms1 heterodimer, thus supporting \nthe formation of a larger multi-protein complex involved in MMR [79].  It is therefore \ntempting to speculate that Exo1 may behave similarly during meiosis by supporting \nthe formation\/function of the Mlh1\/Mlh3 complex and a recent physical analysis of \ncrossing-over at the HIS4LEU2 hotspot by Zakharyevich et al. [61] supports such a \nconclusion.  However, in the Y55 strain background, a MIP box mutant exo1-S445A \nF447A F448A that is defective in Mlh1 binding was found to exhibit a wild-type \ncrossover phenotype in six genetic intervals when assessed genetically.  This resulted \nin a wild-type spore viability (V.E. Cotton & R.H. Borts, data not shown), arguing \nthat this same interaction motif may not be essential for the non-catalytic function of \nExo1 during crossover promotion. \n \n4.4 The nature of the spore death in the separation-of-function allele \nIn the exo1-D173A strain, an increased frequency of three-viable spore tetrads was \nobserved compared to both wild-type and exo1\uf044 (Figure 3).  We hypothesise that \nthese events could arise if the lengths of resection that occur are sufficient to enable \nstrand invasion but insufficient to allow strand capture.  If strand capture is \nunsuccessful, a half crossover and a single broken chromatid could result leading to \nthe death of the spore inheriting the broken chromatid (Figure 5).  Similar situations \nhave been suggested to occur in the absence of the strand annealing activity of Rad52 \n[80] and during heteroduplex rejection of the second-end capture during homeologous \nrecombination [81].  Given that such an event need only occur at a single DSB to \ncause the death of one spore within a tetrad and each cell is estimated to undergo \napproximately 150 DSBs per meiosis [82], only a very low frequency of these \naberrant events would be required to produce the viability pattern observed in exo1-\nD173A meiosis.   The differential ability of a break to undergo strand invasion and \nstrand capture could be explained either by differing amounts of resection either side \nof the DSB or if the length of resection required for strand capture is greater than that \nnecessary for strand invasion.  Broken chromatids may similarly arise in exo1\uf044 cells \nbut the high levels of meiosis I non-disjunction that occur may mask this phenotype.  \n \n4.5 Conclusions \nIn conclusion, Exo1 appears to perform at least three roles during meiotic DSB repair.  \nFirstly, it functions in the 5\uf0a2 to 3\uf0a2 end resection that takes place following DSB \nformation.  Secondly, it is required for the additional removal of DNA after strand \ninvasion which allows newly synthesised DNA to be incorporated into hDNA thus \nleading to gene conversion and finally, it plays a nuclease-independent role in the \nstabilisation of crossover-designated intermediates.  In contrast to earlier models \nproposed to explain the crossover deficit observed in exo1\uf044 strains, it appears to be \nthis nuclease-independent function that is the most important in terms of ensuring \ncrossing-over at the majority of loci. \n \nConflict of interest statement \nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest. \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis work was funded by a BBSRC doctoral training grant studentship to REK,  \nan MRC doctoral training grant studentship to VEC and a BBSRC grant to ASHG.  \nRHB holds a Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award.

PCR primer pairs were designed to \nanneal either side of these sites.  Amplification was only possible from these primers \nwhen the restriction site indicated was present in single-stranded form and thus \nprotected from restriction endonuclease cleavage.  Each pair was used in conjunction \nwith a second pair of primers at the rDNA locus that served to measure the total \namount of DNA within the reaction.  (B) Non-cumulative curves describing the \nformation of DSBs at HIS4 and the production of ssDNA at approximately 0.5 kb, 0.8 \nkb, 1.25 kb and 2 kb from the HIS4 hotspot in wild-type (RKD51), exo1\uf044 (RKD52) \nand exo1-D173A (RKD55) meiotic time course experiments.  Each data point plotted \nis the average of two independent time courses.  Bars indicate the range observed.  \n(C) The non-cumulative data for the wild-type and exo1\uf044 time courses presented were \nconverted to cumulative curves as described in Methods 2.6.  (D) The cumulative \namount of ssDNA produced by 12 hours was then divided by the total amount of \nDSBs formed in order to estimate the overall proportion of DSBs resected as far as \neach target site during the 12 hour period monitored.  The proportions observed are \nplotted with respect to the HIS4 start codon.  For each genotype, the data presented is \nthe mean of two independent time courses. Bars indicate the range observed. \n \nFigure 2 - The effect of EXO1 deletion on the HIS4 gene conversion gradient \nFollowing tetrad dissection, gene conversion was measured at two alleles situated 96 \nbp and 1,688 bp from the HIS4 start codon (approximately 0.4 kb and 2 kb from the \nHIS4 hotspot).  Gene conversions result from the presence of mismatches within \nheteroduplex DNA (hDNA) formed during recombination.  In fungi, the frequency of \ngene conversion is known to decrease with increasing distance from the DSB and this \nis termed a conversion gradient [31].  In the absence of EXO1, gene conversion is \nsignificantly reduced at both alleles. The wild-type data was derived from crosses \nRK358 x RK392 and RK385 x RK392.  The corresponding exo1\uf044 strains were \nRK359 x RK394 and RK387 x RK394. \n \nFigure 3 - Genetic analysis in wild-type, exo1\uf044 and exo1-D173A strains \n*Manuscript figure legends\nClick here to view linked References\n(A) Schematic diagram showing the approximate chromosomal locations of markers \nused in genetic analysis (drawings not to scale). (B) Patterns of spore viability \nobtained in wild-type (RK358 x RK392), exo1\uf044 (RK359 x RK394) and exo1-D173A \n(RK399 x RK425) indicating the proportions of viable spores per tetrad.  The total \nnumber of tetrads dissected for each strain is indicated and the overall viability given \nin parentheses. (C) Measurements of map distances in six intervals were calculated \nusing the formula of Perkins et al. [49].  Comparisons between recombination classes \nwere made by G-test and statistically significant differences (p<0.0256) are indicated \nby an asterisk. (D) Rates of chromosome III meiosis I non-disjunction were assessed \nby monitoring the proportion of non-mating spores produced.  Statistical comparisons \nwere made as above and significant differences are indicated by asterisks. \n \nFigure 4 - Schematic diagram of HIS4 marker configurations used in random \nspore analysis \nIn order to assess recombination associated with the HIS4 hotspot, two diploids (A \nand B) were used containing different pairs of his4 hetero-alleles.  The configurations \nof markers on the two parental chromosomes (P1 and P2) in these diploids are \nillustrated.  The positions of the his4-xho, his4-cla and his4-bgl alleles are given \nrelative to the HIS4 start codon and the orientations of the flanking nourseothricin \n(NAT) and hygromycin B (HPH) drug-resistance cassettes are shown.  The NAT and \nHPH cassettes are located 3,806 bp downstream and 5,130 bp upstream of the HIS4 \nstart codon respectively.  The HIS4 hotspot breakpoint is located approximately 300 \nbp upstream of the start codon and is indicated by the arrows.  The strains used were \nRKD62 to RKD79. \n \nFigure 5 \u2013 Model demonstrating multiple roles for Exo1 during meiotic \nrecombination. \n(A) Following DSB formation, Exo1 acts to resect the DNA ends in a 5\uf0a2 to 3\uf0a2 \ndirection.  When Exo1 nuclease activity is absent, limited resection may be catalysed \nby Mre11 and\/or Sae2. The overhanging 3\uf0a2 strands can then begin to interact with the \nhomologous chromosome and a D-loop is produced upon invasion.  If a break is to be \nrepaired as a non-crossover, DNA synthesis and strand displacement will follow.  (B) \nAlong the crossover pathway, the D-loop requires stabilisation by proteins such as \nMsh4\/Msh5 (shown in orange).  If Exo1 also performs an early stabilising function, \nits absence may lead to displacement of the SEI, collapsing the D-loop.  A non-\ncrossover can be formed by SDSA.  (C) With a stable SEI, extensive DNA synthesis \nthen takes place, which may or may not be coordinated with processive resection. (D) \nThe synthesised end is eventually displaced and attempts to anneal to the strand \nuncovered by resection on the opposite side of the break.  (E) If there is insufficient \nresection for this annealing to occur, a half crossover and a single broken chromatid \ncould result. (F) Upon successful annealing, if DNA synthesis and resection do not \noccur at the same rate, DNA flaps could be formed from displacement of the \nunresected region.  (G) These flaps normally require Exo1 for removal, allowing dHJ \nto form and undergo subsequent resolution as crossovers. (H) When Exo1 nuclease \nactivity is absent, 3\uf0a2 flaps could be produced that may serve as substrates for \nMus81\/Mms4 (indicated by green triangle). This would then permit ligation and \ncompletion of the dHJ.  (I) If instead of\/in addition to an early stabilising role, the \nnuclease-independent function of Exo1 (shown in purple) acts to stabilise the dHJ \nstructure, crossovers would form as normal in exo1-D173A.  (J) Without this \nstabilising activity in exo1\uf044, crossovers would not be produced. \n \nTable 1 \u2013 Haploid yeast strains \n  \nStrain Genotype\na\n \nRK358  his4-xho MAT\uf061 ade1-1 lys5-p cyh2-z CEN8:URA3 arg4-nsp \nRK359  his4-xho MAT\uf061 ade1-1 lys5-p cyh2-z CEN8:URA3 arg4-nsp exo1\uf044::KanMX4 \nRK385  his4-bgl MAT\uf061 ade1-1 lys5-p cyh2-z CEN8:URA3 arg4-nsp \nRK387  his4-bgl MAT\uf061 ade1-1 lys5-p cyh2-z CEN8:URA3 arg4-nsp exo1\uf044::KanMX4 \nRK392  leu2-r MATa ade1-1 met13-b trp5-s \nRK394  leu2-r MATa ade1-1 met13-b trp5-s exo1\uf044::KanMX4 \nRK399  his4-xho MAT\uf061 ade1-1 lys5-p cyh2-z CEN8:URA3 arg4-nsp exo1-D173A \nRK425  leu2-r MATa ade1-1 met13-b trp5-s exo1-D173A \n   \na\nAll strains are in the SK1 background and are also ho::LYS2 lys2 ura3 \n \nTable\nTable 2 \u2013 Diploid yeast strains \n \nStrain Genotype\na\n \nRKD51 his4-xho  LEU2    MAT\uf061   ade1-1    lys5-p MET13 cyh2-z TRP5   CEN8:URA3  arg4-nsp  \nHIS4       leu2-r    MATa    ade1-1    LYS5 met13-b CYH2 trp5-s    CEN8              ARG4 \nRKD52 his4-xho  LEU2    MAT\uf061   ade1-1    lys5-p MET13 cyh2-z TRP5   CEN8:URA3  arg4-nsp    exo1\uf044::KanMX4 \nHIS4       leu2-r    MATa    ade1-1    LYS5 met13-b CYH2 trp5-s    CEN8             ARG4        exo1\uf044::KanMX4 \nRKD55 his4-xho  LEU2    MAT\uf061   ade1-1    lys5-p MET13 cyh2-z TRP5   CEN8:URA3  arg4-nsp    exo1-D173A \nHIS4       leu2-r    MATa    ade1-1    LYS5 met13-b CYH2 trp5-s    CEN8              ARG4    exo1-D173A \nRKD80 his4-xho  LEU2    MAT\uf061   ade1-1    lys5-p MET13 cyh2-z TRP5     arg4-        rad50S::URA3 \nHIS4       leu2-r    MATa    ade1-1    LYS5 met13-b CYH2 trp5-s    ARG4        rad50S::URA3 \nRKD81 his4-xho  LEU2    MAT\uf061   ade1-1    lys5-p MET13 cyh2-z TRP5    arg4-        rad50S::URA3     exo1\uf044::KanMX4 \nHIS4       leu2-r    MATa    ade1-1    LYS5 met13-b CYH2 trp5-s    ARG4        rad50S::URA3    exo1\uf044::KanMX4 \nRKD62,63,64\n  \nRRP7                 his4-xho         FUS1               MAT\uf061          ade1-1    CAN1    cyh2-z \nRRP7-NatMX4  his4-cla     FUS1-HphMX4    MATa          ade1-1     can1      CYH2 \nRKD65,66,67\n  \nRRP7                  his4-xho         FUS1              MAT\uf061          ade1-1    CAN1    cyh2-z     exo1\uf044::KanMX4 \nRRP7-NatMX4   his4-cla     FUS1-HphMX4   MATa          ade1-1     can1      CYH2     exo1\uf044::KanMX4 \nRKD68,69,70 RRP7                  his4-xho         FUS1              MAT\uf061          ade1-1    CAN1    cyh2-z     exo1-D173A \nRRP7-NatMX4   his4-cla     FUS1-HphMX4   MATa          ade1-1     can1      CYH2     exo1-D173A \nRKD71, \n72,73 \nRRP7                 his4-bgl         FUS1               MAT\uf061          ade1-1    CAN1    cyh2-z \nRRP7-NatMX4  his4-cla     FUS1-HphMX4   MATa           ade1-1     can1      CYH2 \nRKD74, \n75,76 \nRRP7                 his4-bgl         FUS1               MAT\uf061          ade1-1    CAN1    cyh2-z    exo1\uf044::KanMX4 \nRRP7-NatMX4  his4-cla     FUS1-HphMX4   MATa           ade1-1     can1     CYH2    exo1\uf044::KanMX4 \nRKD77, \n78,79 \nRRP7                 his4-bgl         FUS1               MAT\uf061          ade1-1    CAN1    cyh2-z     exo1-D173A \nRRP7-NatMX4  his4-cla     FUS1-HphMX4   MATa           ade1-1     can1     CYH2     exo1-D173A \n  \na \nAll strains are in the SK1 strain background and are also ho::LYS2 lys2 ura3.

DNA was digested with BglII in order to estimate \nthe total amount of breaks formed and the position of the break with respect to the \nHIS4 start codon.  The mean amount of DSBs produced in wild-type cells (RKD80) \nwas 12.8%, 14.7% in an exo1\u2206 strain (RKD81) and 13.2% in exo1-D173A (RKD82). \nThese values were not significantly different from one another (p>0.7, t-test).  (B) \nDNA from a rad50S culture was digested with EcoRV to look for the presence of \nDSBs downstream of HIS4.  BstEII digested lambda DNA was used as a molecular \nweight standard and the size of each band is indicated.  The black boxes represent the \napproximate location of the probe used for DSB analysis. \n \nSupplemental Figure 2 \u2013 An example illustrating prototroph formation between \nheteroalleles \nIn this example, a his4-cla\/his4-bgl heteroallelic cross is presented.  Cassettes \nconferring resistance to nourseothricin and hygromycin B are inserted on the his4-cla \nchromosome.  (A) In such crosses, prototrophs most commonly arise when DSBs \noccur on the chromosome containing the mutant allele situated closest to the break \nsite (in this case, his4-cla).  (B) Following strand invasion, DNA synthesis then takes \nplace using the his4-bgl strand as a template.  If this synthesis terminates between the \nhis4-cla and his4-bgl sites, a HIS4 strand is produced.  (C) If the invading strand is \nthen displaced to form a non-crossover, a His+ spore may result depending upon the \ndirection of mismatch repair.  This spore will be both NatR and HygR (D) \nAlternatively, if the break is to be repaired as a crossover, a dHJ intermediate will be \nproduced.  (E) Resolution of this dHJ in one orientation (indicated by green triangles) \nwill yield a His+ spore (F). (G) Resolution in the alternative orientation may also \nproduce a His+ spore (H), depending upon the directionality of mismatch repair.  In \nboth cases, the His+ spore will by NatR HygS.  Boxes indicate potential sources of His+ \nspores.  \n"}
