His \nfinding that high unemployment rates are associated with lower mortality and vice versa \nstands in stark contrast to Brenner\u2019s earlier work, who found the opposite effect, \npossibly after a time lag. Ruhm controls for state-specific effects in a panel of US states \nover the period 1972 to 1991, whereas Brenner\u2019s work is based on time-series analysis. \nExtending and improving upon Ruhm\u2019s original analysis, we analyse the effect of state \nunemployment and economic growth rates on mortality in the states of Germany over \nthe period 1980 to 2000, both in a static and a dynamic econometric model. Controlling \nfor state-specific effects, we find evidence that aggregate mortality rates for all age \ngroups taken together as well as most specific age groups are lower in recessions. The \nsame is true for mortality from cardiovascular diseases, pneumonia and influenza, motor \nvehicle accidents and suicides, but not necessarily for other specific mortality causes. In \nparticular, there never is a statistically significant effect on homicides, other external \neffects and malignant neoplasms. There are also few differences apparent between the \neffect on male and female mortality. If we do not control for state-specific effects, then \nwe often arrive at the opposite result with higher unemployment being associated with \nhigher mortality. This suggests that a failure to control for time-invariant state-specific \neffects leads to omitted variable bias, which would erroneously suggest that mortality \nrates move counter-cyclically. Overall, we can confirm Ruhm\u2019s main finding for \n 2 \nanother country: recessions lower some, but not all, mortality rates in the case of \nGermany. \n \nKeywords: Unemployment, economic growth, recessions, mortality, health, fixed \neffects. \n \n \nIntroduction \nThe effect of short-term economic fluctuations on the state of health in general and \nmortality in particular has found the interest of scholars since Brenner\u2019s (1973, 1975, \n1979, 1987, 1995) path-breaking work. Brenner found with the help of time-series \nanalysis that recessions are associated with deteriorating health in the United States, \nEngland and Wales and Sweden. Others have failed to find analogous evidence in a \nreplication of his work on other countries or time-periods (Forbes and McGregor 1984; \nWagstaff 1985; Joyce and Mocan 1993). The major advantage of Ruhm\u2019s (2000) \nanalysis of the effect of unemployment rates on mortality rates in US states over the \nperiod 1972-1991 is the use of panel data. He finds that \u2018state unemployment rates are \nnegatively and significantly related to total mortality and eight of the ten specific causes \nof fatalities\u2019 (Ruhm 2000, p. 617, emphasis in original). In other words, mortality \nbehaves pro-cyclically as it moves with the business cycle. Panel data analysis has the \nadvantage over time-series analysis that it can control for time-invariant state-specific \neffects and thus control for a potentially important source of omitted variable bias. \nGerdtham and Ruhm (2002) find similar evidence to Ruhm (2000) in pooling data \nfrom OECD-countries. Ruhm (2001) himself has repeated his analysis on individual \nrather than aggregate data from the 1972-1981 US National Health Interview Surveys, \n 3 \ncoming to very similar conclusions as his analysis with aggregate data. In particular, he \nfinds that the number of medical problems, the prevalence of acute morbidities and the \nnumber of reported \u201cbed-days\u201d all fall in economic recessions. Gerdtham and \nJohannesson (2002), on the other hand, find in their analysis of individual data from \nSweden that some aspects of male mortality move counter-cyclically rather than pro-\ncyclically, whereas the business cycle is unrelated to female mortality. However, Tapia \nGranados (2003) in his analysis of the relationship between economic fluctuations and \naggregate mortality in the 19th and 20th century does find a pro-cyclical movement in \nSwedish mortality rates. Tapia Granados (2002) finds similar results pooling data from \nthe 50 Spanish provinces over the period 1980 to 1997. \nThe objective of this paper is to test the relationship between aggregate mortality \nand economic fluctuations for a different nation-state, namely Germany over the period \n1980 to 2000. For Germany, no comprehensive individual data are available. Germany \nis an obvious candidate for an analysis of aggregate data, however, since similar to the \nUS it is a federal nation-state, which allows panel data analysis, and as one nation-state, \nGermany is also more homogeneous in terms of population characteristics than a pool \nof nation-states, which helps to reduce omitted variable bias. We will show that \neconomic recessions lower aggregate and some specific mortality rates, thus providing \nmore support for Tapia Granados\u2019 (2002, p. 41) contention that \u2018the procyclical \ncharacter of mortality fluctuations is beginning to be a proven fact\u2019. \nLike Ruhm (2000) we also use fixed-effects estimation. At the same time, we \nimprove on his analysis in a number of ways. First, we use standard errors, which are \nrobust towards arbitrary heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation. Second, in sensitivity \nanalysis we additionally make standard errors robust towards clustering such that \nobservations are merely assumed to be independent across states, but not necessarily \n 4 \nwithin states. Third, we use a dynamic model, which does not require the researcher to \nspecify the number of time lags included in the model, a decision, which is always and \nby necessity somewhat arbitrary. Instead, we include the lagged dependent variable and \ncorrect for the correlation of the regressor with the error term with the help of Arellano \nand Bond\u2019s (1991) Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimator. Fourth, we look \nat gender-specific mortality rates to test for gender differences. \n \n \nThe impact of economic fluctuations on health \nThere are many theories of the impact of economic fluctuations on health conditions. \nHowever, one can perhaps distinguish between two main perspectives. As the main \nobjective of this paper is an empirical analysis, we will merely sketch the arguments \nhere. The reader is referred to Brenner and Mooney (1983), Watkins (1985), Ruhm \n(2000) and the many references cited therein for a more extensive discussion. One \nperspective focuses on the social and psychological aspects of the hardship caused by \neconomic downturns (see, for example, Watkins 1985). The material losses associated \nwith unemployment and the material insecurity for those who manage to stay in \nemployment, but are at risk of losing their job in recessions, lower personal health-\nrelated expenditures and possibly lead to unhealthy diets. The stress, anxiety and \npsychological hardship connected to loss of job or fear of loss of job are also \ndetrimental to health as affected individuals resort to medication, alcohol and other \ndrugs to alleviate their stress and hardship. Novo, Hammarstr\u00f6m and Janlert (2001) \nreport that employed young persons aged 21 report more somatic and psychological \nsymptoms during economic downturn than during economic upturn. Unemployed \npeople not only lose materially, they also potentially lose access to social networks, \n 5 \nself-esteem, self-confidence, a scheduled life structure, a sense of identity and possibly \na purpose for their lives (Brenner and Mooney 1983; Watkins 1985; Winkelmann and \nWinkelmann 1998). There is evidence that people who become unemployed suffer from \ndeteriorating mental and physical health and wellbeing (Warr 1987; Jahoda 1988; \nWadsworth, Montgomery and Bartley 1999; Flatau, Galea and Petridis 2000). \nThe other perspective is derived from an explicitly economic model of utility \nmaximization. In this model economic upturns can have negative and recessions can \nhave positive effects on health for at least four major reasons: First, in economic upturns \nthe opportunity costs of leisure time increase as individuals work more and gain more. \nAs a consequence, less time will be spent on health-preserving activities and routine \nmedical check-ups. Less time is available for cooking lower-calorie and better quality \nmeals at home and more calorie-rich prepared food will be consumed (Chou, Grossman \nand Saffer 2002). Second, job-related stress will increase during periods of economic \nupturn, particularly if hours of working and work pressure are increased due to \nexpanding economic activity. Whilst individuals might resort to increased tobacco use, \nalcohol, medication and drugs in times of economic downturn, they might equally well \nresort to the same means of seeming relief to cope with the stress of periods of \neconomic expansions. Third, work-related accidents increase in periods of economic \nexpansion (Tapia Granados 2002). Some sectors, which tend to move pro-cyclically \nsuch as construction works, are particularly prone to high accident rates (Ruhm 2002). \nFourth, temporary increases in income due to economic expansion might increase the \nconsumption of health-damaging goods such as alcohol and tobacco (Freeman 1999; \nRuhm 2002; Ruhm and Black 2002). \nNote that the two perspectives and the theories associated with them need not be \ninconsistent with each other. Instead, they could capture two different aspects of a \n 6 \ncomplex impact of economic fluctuations on health and mortality. If the two effects are \nof approximately equal strength, then our empirical analysis will fail to find any \nstatistically significant effect. If one effect is stronger than the other, then we will find \nan either positive or negative statistically significant effect. Even if this is the case, it \ndoes not imply that the other effect is non-existent. Instead, it merely means that one \neffect is so much stronger than the other that the overall effect goes into one direction. \n \n \nResearch Design \nThe dependent variables \nLike Ruhm (2000) we include total mortality for all age groups taken together as well as \ntotal mortality for three specific age groups (20-44, 45-64, older than 65) and ten \nspecific mortality causes: malignant neoplasms (ICD 140-208), cardiovascular diseases \n(ICD 390-459), pneumonia and influenza (ICD 480-487), chronic liver diseases (ICD \n571), motor vehicle accidents (E810-825), intentional self-damage (suicide) (E950-\n959), murder and manslaughter (homicide) (E960-969), other external effects (E800-\n809, E826-949), neonatal mortality (death within 28 days after birth) and infant \nmortality (death within the first year after birth). In extension to Ruhm (2000) we also \nlook at gender-specific mortality rates to see whether there are any differences between \nthe sexes. The data have been purchased from the German federal statistical office as a \nspecial analysis (\u201cSonderaufbereitung\u201d) of their health statistical database. They have \nbeen transformed into mortality rates with state population data taken from Statistisches \nBundesamt (various years). Codes refer to the ninth version of the International \nClassification of Diseases (ICD-9). Codes changed in the update to ICD-10, which took \neffect in the German health statistics in 1998, but the categories stayed the same. Our \n 7 \nperiod of analysis covers the years 1980 to 2000. The ten specific mortality causes are \nresponsible for between 73 and 88 percent of total mortality depending on the year, \nwhich is similar to the US case, where they account for around 80 percent of total \nmortality on average (Ruhm 2000, p. 622). \nOf course, as has been noted by many (Wagstaff 1985; McAvinchey 1988; Ruhm \n2000) it would be better if we could use morbidity rather than mortality data as \nmortality captures only the extreme fatal consequence of bad health. Unfortunately, \nhowever, no such data are available and we are therefore left with mortality data. \nSimilarly, in principle it would have also been better to use data of individuals rather \nthan aggregates due to the so-called \u2018ecological fallacy\u2019 problem. However, no such \ncomprehensive data are available for Germany. In its absence, aggregate data analysis is \nstill informative, even if one needs to be careful in drawing conclusions from the \naggregate level to individual behaviour (Gravelle, Wildman and Sutton 2002). \n \nThe independent variables \nLike Ruhm (2000) we take the state unemployment rate as our main indicator of \neconomic fluctuations. It is also the indicator most often used by researchers (Watkins \n1985). In sensitivity analysis, we use the growth rate in real GDP as an alternative \nindicator. As further control variables, we use personal available income per capita in \nreal prices of 1995.1 Presumably, health care is a normal good such that all other things \nequal mortality rates should go down if real incomes rise as individuals will spend more \nmoney on health-preserving investments. There is also substantial empirical evidence \nfor this (Pritchett and Summers 1996; Ettner 1996).2 On the other hand, many health-\ndamaging consumption expenditures such as drinking and smoking are also likely to be \nnormal goods (Freeman 1999; Ruhm and Black 2002). The effect of the average income \n 8 \nlevel on aggregate mortality rates is therefore ambiguous. Note that this does not \ncontradict the empirical evidence of cross-sectional studies showing that low-income \nsocial classes have higher mortality rates than high-income social classes at any \nmoment of time (see, for example, Townsend, Davidson and Whitehead 1992). \nBoth real GDP and nominal personally available income data are taken from \nStatistisches Landesamt Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg (2002), which were converted into real \nterms using the German GDP deflator. Like Ruhm (2000), in order to control for \ndifferences in age structure, we take the percentage of the population under 5 years as \nwell as those aged 65 or over as two further control variables. Ruhm (2000) further uses \nthe percentage of population that is black or Hispanic as these ethnic minorities are \nlikely to have higher mortality rates. The closest we can have in the German case is the \npercentage of foreigners among the total population. All these population characteristics \ndata are taken from Statistisches Bundesamt (various years). The only control variables \nincluded in Ruhm (2000), for which we have no equivalent, are the ones capturing the \nstatus of education. Whilst such data exist in principle for some years in the so-called \nGerman microcensus, they have been aggregated from the individual to state aggregates \nonly for the years 1999 and 2000. Whilst regrettable, the lack of such variables are \nlikely to cause concern only if we believe that the state unemployment rate is strongly \ncorrelated with the omitted variables of education status. We have no reason to believe \nthis is the case. Education status is relatively homogenous across German states due to \nfree access to public schools and universities, the quality of which varies only little \nacross states and time. \nAs a further control variable we include the Gini coefficient as a measure of income \ninequality. Such data are only available from 1985 onwards, which is why this variable \n 9 \nis included only in sensitivity analysis. Data were kindly provided by Peter Krause from \nthe German Institute for Economic Research, Berlin. \n \nThe estimation technique \nWe will estimate both a static model, with contemporaneous effects only, and a \ndynamic model, which allows for lagged effects of unemployment on mortality. In a \nstatic context, we estimate the following panel data model: \n \nyit = \u03bb + \u03b21xit + \u03b3tTt + \u03b5it , where \u03b5it = ui + vit. (1) \n \nwhere the subscript t stands for time and i for each state. The y is the (logged) mortality \nrate, the matrix x contains the explanatory variables, including the state unemployment \nrate. There are (t-1) year-specific dummy variables, which capture decreases in \nmortality rates over time due to, for example, improved health technology, healthier \nlifestyles and so on. The ui are unobserved state-specific time-invariant fixed effects and \nvit is a stochastic error term.  \nThere are basically two estimators available for estimating equation (1), namely the \nfixed-effects and random-effects estimator. The fixed-effects estimator subtracts from \nthe equation to be estimated the over-time average of the equation for each state. \nBecause of this so-called within transformation the individual state-specific fixed effects \nui are wiped out and the coefficients are estimated based on the time variation within \neach cross-sectional unit. The random-effects estimator, on the other hand, is based on \nthe assumption that the fixed effects are random effects such that they can be included \nin the stochastic error term. \n 10 \nThe big advantage of the fixed-effects estimator is that any potential correlation of \nthe explanatory variables with the fixed effects is avoided since the fixed effects and \ntherefore their correlation with the explanatory variables are wiped out from the \nequation to be estimated. As a consequence, the estimation is unbiased even if the \nexplanatory variables are correlated with the unobserved state-specific time-invariant \neffects as is likely to be the case here \u2013 one of the reasons to prefer fixed-effects over \nrandom-effects estimation. Also, given that our sample covers all states of a country \nrather than a random sample of it, the fixed-effects specification is the more natural one. \nWe therefore use the fixed-effects estimator. \nLike Ruhm (2000) we will weight observations by the square root of the state \npopulation in order to mitigate potential heteroscedasticity problems. In extension to \nRuhm (2000), we also employ standard errors, which are robust towards arbitrary \nautocorrelation (as well as heteroscedasticity). It is not quite clear, why Ruhm did not \nuse robust standard errors. Given that his panel is cross-sectionally dominated since his \ndata draw from many more states than our analysis, he is perhaps less concerned about \nautocorrelation than we are. \nAs a next step, we will allow for a lagged effect of unemployment on mortality as \nwell, using a dynamic econometric model. There are two basic ways to account for such \nlagged effects of the explanatory variable, namely via finite distributed lag (FDL) or \ninfinite distributed lag (IDL) models. The FDL model assumes that the explanatory \nvariable impacts upon the dependent variable over a finite time period. The simplest \nway to account for this is to include both the contemporaneous explanatory variable and \na number of lags of this variable. The problem with this approach is the high \nmulticollinearity amongst the lagged variables and the need to choose how many lags \nare included. Imposing a polynomial structure on the lagged variables such that the \n 11 \neffect is declining linearly (polynomial of order one) or non-linearly (polynomial of \nsecond order or higher) circumvents the multicollinearity problem (Hill, Griffiths and \nJudge 1997). It does leave the researcher with the problem of choosing the correct lag \nlength, however. Brenner (1979), for example, chose a ten-year lag. Ruhm (2000, p. \n634) uses a four-year lag because the coefficient on the fifth lag in the total mortality \nestimation was insignificant at the 95 percent level. Such a decision rule is of course \nessentially arbitrary and therefore problematic. \nIn the IDL model no lag length needs to be chosen as by definition an infinite \nnumber of lags is included. The IDL model can be written as: \n \nyt = \u03b1 + \u2211\n\u221e\n=0j\n\u03b2jxt-j + et  (2) \n \nNote that for simplicity and for the time being we ignore the fact that we have panel \ndata and we look at a pure time-series problem. Later on, we will revert back to our \npanel data context. Clearly, in its general form, equation (2) cannot be estimated as it \nimplies an infinite number of coefficients to be estimated. It turns out, however, that \nsimilar to the FDL model, the problem can be circumvented if some structure is \nimposed on the lags. Koyck (1954) showed that with a geometric lag structure, equation \n(2) can be transformed into the following model: \n \nyt = \u03bb + \u03b21yt-1 + \u03b22xt + \u03b5t  (3) \n \nIf we put equation (3) into a panel data context then it is written more generally as \nfollows: \n \n 12 \nyit = \u03bb + \u03b21yit-1 + \u03b22xit + \u03b3tTt + \u03b5it , where \u03b5it = ui + vit. (4) \n \nThe short-run or contemporaneous effect of the explanatory variable on the \ndependent variable is simply given by \u03b22, whereas the long-run effect can be computed \nas \u03b22\/(1-\u03b21). As equation (4) is estimated for each mortality cause, the lag with which \nunemployment affects mortality can of course differ from cause to cause. \nEstimation of equation (6) with either ordinary least squares (OLS) or a fixed-effects \nor a first-differenced panel estimator is problematic. This is because of the inclusion of \nthe lagged dependent variable as a regressor. Since yit is a function of ui, so is yit-1. The \ncorrelation of a regressor with the error term renders the OLS estimator both biased and \ninconsistent. The same is true for the fixed-effects or first-differenced estimator. Whilst \nin the process of estimation the ui are wiped out, biasedness and inconsistency is a \nconsequence of the correlation between yit-1 and vit-1 (Baltagi 1995, p. 126). \nThere are two ways to estimate equation (6) without bias and consistently. One is to \nfollow Anderson and Hsiao (1981) and to use a two-stage least squares (2SLS) first-\ndifferenced estimator, that is, a first differenced estimator with instrumental variables. \nFirst differencing wipes out the ui and using either yit-2 or \u2206yit-2 (that is, yit-2-yit-3) as an \ninstrument for yit-1 solves the problem since neither instrument is correlated with \u2206yit. In \naddition, further lags can be included. Alternatively, one can use the so-called Arellano \nand Bond (1991) Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimator. The basic idea of \nthis estimator is to use all prior dependent variables that are valid instruments, not just \nyit-2. We will use the Arellano and Bond dynamic panel estimator as it is more efficient \nthan the 2SLS first-differenced estimator together with heteroscedasticity-robust \nstandard errors. \n \n 13 \nThe sample \nThe sample consists of all eleven Western German states until 1990 and all sixteen \nGerman states from 1991 onwards, with Western Berlin becoming Berlin after re-\nunification. We thus have a sample of 281 observations. Note that in using Arellano and \nBond\u2019s (1991) GMM estimator, we lose the first two years of data as the lagged \ndependent variable is one of the explanatory variables and needs to be instrumented for \nwith a further lag. Ruhm (2000) provides estimates with and without year-specific \ndummy variables as well as with and without available income per capita included. \nThere is little justification for estimates without year-specific effects and without \nincome per capita. The year-specific effects capture exogenous changes in the mortality \nrate unrelated to our explanatory variables, e.g. progress in life-saving medical \ntechnology, and excluding income per capita might lead to omitted variable bias. Hence \nwe only report estimations with both included, but our results do not change much if we \napply one of the other specifications.3 We take the natural log of the dependent variable \nto render its distribution less skewed and to allow an easy to understand elasticity \ninterpretation of the results. However, our results do not change much if the estimate is \nin levels of the dependent variable, rather than in natural logs. \n \n \nResults \nWe start with the static model with contemporaneous effects only. Table 1 presents \nresults for aggregate mortality rates for all age groups, specific age groups as well as for \nboth sexes. Note that for simplicity, only the coefficients of the unemployment rate is \nshown, whereas the coefficients of the other control variables and the year-specific time \ndummies are suppressed. We will come back to the other control variables further \n 14 \nbelow. We can see that the unemployment rate is negatively and statistically \nsignificantly related to the overall mortality rate for all age groups taken together as well \nas to the mortality rate for all specific age groups and both sexes. Next, we look at \nspecific mortality causes. The unemployment rate is negatively associated with \nmortality from cardiovascular diseases as well as suicide for males, females and both \nsexes taken together. A similar effect is observable for mortality from motor vehicle \naccidents for both sexes taken together and females, but not for males. Combined sex as \nwell as male mortality from pneumonia and influenza is negatively associated to the \nunemployment rate, but not in the case of females. Similar to Ruhm (2000) we find no \nstatistically significant impact of unemployment on deaths from malignant neoplasms. \nContrary to Ruhm (2000), however, is our result that mortality from liver diseases, \nhomicide, other external effects as well as the infant and neonatal mortality rate are all \nstatistically independent from the unemployment rate.4 Contrary to Ruhm (2000) is also \nour result that mortality from suicide behaves pro-cyclically as this was the only \nmortality cause, for which he found a counter-cyclical behaviour. \n \n< Insert Table 1 about here > \n \nEstimates from the dynamic model, for which results are reported in Table 2, are \nrather similar to the results from the static model in terms of sign of coefficient and \nstatistical significance of the unemployment rate.5 The aggregate mortality rate for all \nage groups taken together is negatively associated with the unemployment rate as in the \nstatic model. The same is true for female mortality as well as mortality in the age groups \n20 to 45 and older than 65, but the unemployment rate is highly insignificant for the age \ngroup 45 to 65 and for male mortality. Note, however, that in the latter case the \n 15 \nunemployment rate remains statistically significant with a negative coefficient if the \ntotal male mortality is replaced by the sum of all specific mortality causes for males \nlooked at here. As concerns these specific mortality causes, cardiovascular diseases are \npro-cyclical for both sexes individually as well as taken together. The same is true for \nmortality from motor vehicle accidents, but as with the static model the unemployment \nrate is insignificant for males. Pneumonia and influenza as well as suicide are pro-\ncyclical for both sexes and females, but no longer for males. Deaths from malignant \nneoplasms, murder and manslaughter and other external effects as well as the infant and \nneonatal mortality rate are statistically independent from the unemployment rate. So is \nmortality from liver diseases for females and both sexes together, but in a dynamic \ncontext this mortality cause moves pro-cyclically for males.  \n \n< Insert Table 2 about here > \n \nWhat about the other control variables? Similar to Ruhm (2000), we find that the \nincome variable is sometimes estimated with a positive significant coefficient, \nsometimes with a significant negative coefficient and is often found to be insignificant.6 \nHigher income is associated with lower mortality from pneumonia and influenza, but \nhigher total mortality as well as mortality from cardiovascular diseases, malignant \nneoplasms and other external effects. For cardiovascular diseases, it seems likely that \nthe increased demand for health-damaging goods such as excessive food, tobacco, \nalcohol and drugs following income increases more than compensates the effect of \nhigher expenditures into health-preserving investments. In terms of aggregate mortality \nrates according to age groups, we find that higher income levels are not associated with \nmortality rates for the 20 to 45 year olds, are negatively associated with mortality rates \n 16 \nfor the 45 to 65 year olds and positively associated for mortality rates of those 65 years \nand older.7  \nThe population characteristics variables referring to age groups by and large test \naccording to expectation. For example, a higher share of old people increases mortality \nin the case of cardiovascular diseases, malignant neoplasms, but decreases mortality in \nthe case of other external effects and homicide. The share of foreigners is generally \ninsignificant, apart from mortality from other external effects, for which a higher share \nof foreigners is associated with higher mortality. This is different from Ruhm (2000) \nwho found more consistently significant effects for the share of blacks and hispanics. \nThe reason for this difference is likely to be found in Germany\u2019s universal health \ncoverage, which ensures that all foreigners also have full access to medication and \nmedical treatment similar to Germans, whereas the health of ethnic minorities in the US \noften suffers from their inadequate access to health insurance. \n \n \nSensitivity analysis \nWe will now test the sensitivity of our results with regards to model specification. For \nreasons of space, we will merely describe but not report detailed results, which are \navailable from the author upon request, however. To start with, we include the Gini \ncoefficient as a further control variable. As mentioned above, this variable is only \navailable from 1985 onwards. Our results are hardly affected. The coefficient of the \nincome inequality variable itself often has a positive sign, but it is never statistically \nsignificant. This is in accordance with other studies finding no robust evidence that \nincome inequality is statistically significantly related to aggregate health (Gravelle, \nWildman and Sutton 2002). \n 17 \nSo far, we have made standard errors merely robust towards arbitrary \nheteroscedasticity and autocorrelation. Going one step further, one can make standard \nerrors also robust towards the clustering of observations. That is, observations are \nmerely assumed to be independent across states, but not necessarily within states. One \nof the problems associated with making standards errors robust to clustering is the \nconsequent loss in degrees of freedom, which means that the standard errors typically \nbecome larger and our estimations less precise. The major differences are that the total \nmortality rate between the ages 45 and 65, the traffic mortality rate and the mortality \nrate from pneumonia and influenza for both sexes as well as the male suicide rate \nbecome insignificant. Still, our main results are upheld. In particular, total mortality as \nwell as mortality for other age groups, gender-specific mortality as well as the important \nmortality cause cardiovascular disease all move pro-cyclically. \nTo see whether German re-unification might represent a structural break causing \nproblems for our estimations, we simply repeated our analysis of table 1 for the post-\nreunification period only. Clearly, with a much shorter panel estimations become less \nprecise and standard errors become higher. And yet, we still find that overall mortality \nrates and mortality from cardiovascular disease move pro-cyclically. \nBrenner (1995, p. 227) emphasises that \u2018such variables as unemployment (\u2026) are \ntypically associated with increase in mortality rates two to three years following the \nlowest point in the business cycle\u2026\u2019. We have therefore replaced the contemporaneous \nunemployment variable in our static model with the unemployment rate lagged by three \nyears. No positive association between the unemployment rate and mortality rates as \nsuggested by Brenner is apparent. Indeed, in accordance with our dynamic estimation \nresults we find the unemployment rate lagged by three years often to be negatively \nassociated with mortality rates. \n 18 \nHow sensitive are our results towards the indicator of economic fluctuations used? If \nwe replace the unemployment rate with the growth rate in real GDP, then our results are \ngenerally rather similar. In particular, the aggregate mortality rate for all age groups \ntaken together, for all specific age groups as well as mortality from cardiovascular \ndiseases for both sexes are positively associated to changes in GDP.8 The major \ndifference is that pneumonia and influenza as well as suicide no longer react pro-\ncyclically. The infant and neonatal mortality rates, on the other hand, move pro-\ncyclically with changes in real GDP. \n \n \nDiscussion \nWe have seen that economic downturns are associated with lower mortality in German \nstates similar to the pattern observed by Ruhm (2000) for the states of the United States \nof America. The effect is statistically significant for aggregate mortality rates for all age \ngroups taken together, all specific age groups and for both males and females. This is by \nand large true independent of whether the static or dynamic model is estimated and \nindependent of whether the indicator for economic fluctuations is the unemployment \nrate or the real GDP growth rate. How strong is the effect? Table 3 summarises by how \nmany percent the mortality rate decreases following a one percentage point increase in \nthe unemployment rate in the static and the dynamic model.9 Like Ruhm (2000) we find \nthat the effect of unemployment on mortality is weakest in the age group 45 to 65. \nContrary to Ruhm (2000) who found the effect to be by far strongest for the age group \n20 to 44, both our static and dynamic effects show about the same effect for this and the \nage group 65 and older. It is not surprising that young adults are strongly affected by \neconomic conditions given their high labour force participation, but the strength of the \n 19 \neffect for the retired people is somewhat unexpected. With respect to the specific \nmortality causes, the effect of the unemployment rate is about three times stronger on \nmortality from pneumonia and influenza than for the other causes, whereas the size of \nthe effect for the other mortality causes is approximately similar. This is also contrary to \nRuhm (2000) who found the strongest effects with respect to traffic accidents, other \nexternal effects and homicides. What is comforting is that similar to Ruhm (2000) we \nfind no significant effect of the unemployment rate on mortality from malignant \nneoplasms. It would be extremely disturbing if short-run economic fluctuations would \nimpact significantly upon such a disease with a rather long-term determination. Looking \nacross the sexes, there are few differences apparent. \nNo sex is clearly more consistently or more strongly affected by economic \nfluctuations than the other one. Lastly, table 3 shows that the main effect of economic \nfluctuations on mortality seems to occur in the short run as the long-run effect is often \nnot that much bigger than the short-run effect. That the unemployment rate is less \nconsistently and often less clearly statistically significantly negatively related to \nmortality is a consequence of the relative inefficiency of the dynamic GMM estimator. \nWhilst instrumenting the lagged dependent variable avoids its correlation with the error \nterm, the estimation can be inefficient if the instruments are weak. In other words, \nestimation is inefficient if further lags are bad predictors of the lagged dependent \nvariables (Wooldridge 2002). In our case, further lags are actually quite good predictors, \nbut still some loss of efficiency is often unavoidable if instruments need to be used. \n \n< Insert Table 3 about here > \n \n 20 \nWhat is the reason why Ruhm (2000) and our own analysis find that mortality \nmoves pro-cyclically, whereas Brenner\u2019s analysis and those of others found a counter-\ncyclical movement? The main contribution of Ruhm (2000) to the topic was the use of a \nfixed effects estimator, which ensures that the estimations do not suffer from omitted \nvariable bias from variables, which are time-invariant. To see how a failure to control \nfor fixed effects can lead to misleading results, table 4 presents OLS estimates of \nequation (1) without state-specific fixed effects included. The effect of unemployment \nrates on mortality is completely reversed for aggregate mortality for all ages and all \nspecific age groups. A higher unemployment rate is now associated with higher \nmortality! The same is true for many specific mortality causes such as malignant \nneoplasms, liver diseases, homicides and the infant mortality rate. Only mortality from \npneumonia and influenza, suicides as well as motor vehicle accidents still moves pro-\ncyclically. We therefore see how a failure to control for state-specific effects can \nerroneously suggest that aggregate mortality as well as many specific mortality causes \nmove pro-cyclically. \n \n< Insert Table 4 about here > \n \n \nConclusion \nAll in all, we have found confirmation for Ruhm\u2019s (2000) general result in our analysis \nof German states: recessions tend to lower mortality rates. We find consistent and \nrobust evidence that recessions lower aggregate mortality rates for all age groups taken \ntogether as well as all specific age groups. We find less consistent evidence for specific \nmortality causes than Ruhm (2000) did. For both sexes taken together, we find the \n 21 \npredicted effect for cardiovascular diseases, pneumonia and influenza, motor vehicle \naccidents and suicides in both static and dynamic model estimations. These mortality \ncauses make up together between 43 and 66 per cent of total mortality, with \ncardiovascular diseases being by far the most important one. However, contrary to \nRuhm (2000) we find no statistically significant negative effect for liver diseases and \nother external effects. The same is true for infant and neonatal mortality, unless we \nreplace the unemployment rate with the real GDP growth rate as our indicator of \neconomic fluctuations. We also find that the size of the impact compared across age \ngroups and specific mortality causes differs from the ones found by Ruhm (2000). The \nreasons for these differences are not quite clear. It could be that our estimations are less \nefficient given that we have only data for eleven (from 1991 onwards: sixteen) states \navailable, whereas Ruhm (2000) can draw from a much bigger sample. Alternatively, \nthe relationship between economic fluctuations and mortality could also be different in \nGermany due to socio-economic or other factors not captured in our estimations. \nIt is important to be aware of the caveats in interpreting our results. Whilst we show \nthat overall mortality rates as well as some specific rates are counter-cyclical, this does \nnot automatically imply that the average health status is also counter-cyclical. It is \nperfectly possible that a recession lowers the mortality risk for some individuals whilst \nworsening the health status of the majority of other individuals, but short of increased \nmortality. One reason for this could be the negative health effects of recessions for the \nunemployed themselves. Ruhm\u2019s (2000) and our results as well as that of others \ntherefore need not contradict the evidence for the negative effects of unemployment on \nsome health aspects for at least some people. \nThis leads us to the policy implications of our result that economic upturns are \nassociated with greater population mortality and vice versa for economic downturns. As \n 22 \nTapia Granados (2002, p. 41) points out, Brenner\u2019s work is often invoked as additional \nevidence for expansionary economic policies. Surely, the implication of our opposite \nfindings cannot be that recessions are desirable even if, statistically speaking, they lower \nmortality rates. Instead, we need to focus on how the negative impact of economic \nupturns on mortality rates can be mitigated, if not avoided. There has been much focus \non the negative health implications of economic downturns and rightly so. Maybe what \nwe need is a similar focus on the negative health implications in terms of increased \nmortality rates in times of economic upturns. \nFor this we need to better understand the mechanisms that link economic upturns to \nhealth deterioration. Ruhm (2002) and Ruhm and Black (2002) could estimate the \nimpact of economic conditions on such health-relevant activities as smoking and \ndrinking habits, and physical exercise as well as various measures of height-adjusted \nweight from individual state-specific data. They show that lifestyles tend to become \nhealthier in recessions: individuals smoke and drink less, are less severely obese and are \nmore physically active. Unfortunately, for Germany no such individual data were \navailable. In any case, more research is needed into why the positive impacts of \nrecessions on mortality more than compensate the well documented negative health \neffects for certain sub-groups of the population, particularly the unemployed. \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nHelpful comments from Christopher Ruhm, Jos\u00e9 A. Tapia Granados, Stephen Birch and \ntwo anonymous referees are gratefully acknowledged. I would like to thank Peter \nKrause from the German Institute for Economic Research as well as many individuals \n 23 \nin the German Federal Statistical Office as well as in some state Statistical Offices for \nproviding the data required for the analysis. \n 24 \nEndnotes \n                                                 \n1\n Gravelle, Hutchinson and Stern (1981) argued against this variable, which was also used by Brenner \n(1979), saying that it ignores public health-relevant expenditure and that therefore gross domestic product \n(GDP) per capita might be the more relevant variable. Our results do not change if personal income is \nreplaced by GDP. \n2\n Note that this would not contradict the hypothesised negative impact of economic upturns on mortality \nas one needs to distinguish short-term perturbations from long-term income trends. \n3\n Contrary to Ruhm (2000) we do not include state-specific time trends in some estimations or run the \nestimations for certain sub-groups of states. The reason is that we have a much smaller panel than Ruhm \n(2000) who can draw upon data from 50 states and if we replicate such analysis for 11 to 16 states, not \nsurprisingly we get highly inefficient results. \n4\n Note that for the infant and neonatal mortality rate no gender-specific data are available. \n5\n To save space, we suppress the estimates of the lagged dependent variable, the other control variables as \nwell as the year-specific time dummies. For technical reasons, as explained in Arellano and Bond (1991, \n281f.), the GMM estimator becomes inconsistent in the presence of second-order autocorrelation. The \nrelevant test fails to reject the hypothesis of no second-order autocorrelation at the .05 level in all \nregressions but mortality of people 65 years and older, aggregate female mortality as well as male \nmortality from suicides. \n6\n Our main results do not change if, following Gravelle, Wildman and Sutton (2002), we add a squared \nincome term to account for a potentially non-linear effect of income on mortality. We find no evidence \nfor such a non-linear effect and the estimated coefficient of our unemployment variable is hardly affected. \n7\n Interestingly, Snyder and Evans (2002) also find that individuals with higher retirement benefits due to a \nslightly earlier date of birth have higher mortality than those with lower retirement benefits due to a \nslightly later date of birth in their analysis of the so-called \u201cnotch\u201d in US Social Security benefits based \nupon date of birth. \n8\n Only in the dynamic model, the change in GDP variable becomes marginally insignificant for the age \ngroup 65 and older. \n9\n Note that the estimated effect for the male mortality rate in dynamic estimation refers to the sum of \nspecific mortality rates looked at here as the total mortality rate tested insignificantly. \n 25 \nReferences \nAnderson, T.W., & Hsiao, C.
