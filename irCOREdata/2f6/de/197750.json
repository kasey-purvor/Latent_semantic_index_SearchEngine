INTRODUCTION \n \n  Because of the intrinsic breakdown strength of up to \n800kV\/mm and increased maximum operating temperature \nfrom 70\u00b0C to 90\u00b0C after cross linking [2], XLPE cables are the \nbest choice and dominating in power industry nowadays. \nSince the XLPE cables were introduced in the 1960s, \nnumerous tests on cables at all voltages have clearly shown \nthat the semiconductive screening layers play a very important \nrole in the successful operation of a power cable. The \nsemiconductive compounds have been the subject of \ntremendous development over the last two decades and have \nkept pace with the advances in cable technology. [1] \n \n  Research on semicon cable shields has been playing an \nimportant role in the development of electric power cables. \nSemiconducting materials are essential components of the \npower cable, because they are used for: \na. preventing partial discharge at the interfaces between \nthe insulation and conductor and between the \ninsulation and external shielding layer; \nb. moderating the electrical stress in the insulation layer \nby providing a uniform electric field around the cable \ninsulation with reduced potential gradient; \nc. providing protection during short-circuit against \ndamages caused by the heating of the conductor. \n \nIn power cables, conducting carbon black (CB)-filled ethylene \ncopolymers, such as ethylene-butyl acrylate, ethylene vinyl \nacetate and ethylene ethyl acrylate, are commonly used as a \nsemiconducting layer [2]. Different kinds of cables should \nhave different suitable shields. Shields that are designed for \nuse with XLPE dielectric are often not suitable for use with \nEPR dielectric, and vice versa. Likewise, the appropriate \nshield also depends on the configuration of the extrusion line \non which the cable is manufactured [3]. In this research \nproject specifically the semiconductinve materials used are  \nethylene-butyl acrylate copolymers \n \nFactors such as CB content, mixing quality and temperature \nthat affects CB network development, affect the properties of \nCB filled semiconductors. Based on previous research studies, \nincreasing CB loading and process temperature can decrease \nthe volume resistivity, which usually vary between 10 and 100 \n\u03a9 cm and should not exceed 104 \u03a9cm [5][6]. \n \nIt is known that the semiconductive layers can influence the \nloss tangent of power cables. This is surely related to the \nelectric conductivity of the semicon in the radial direction; if \nthe conductivity is too low, there will be losses not only in the \ninsulation but also in the semicons, especially at higher \nfrequencies [7]. The axial resistance of semicon layer will \ndominate the dielectric loss if it is not well grounded, as we \nfound in this paper. Recently there is more awareness of the \ninfluence of semicon shields on the dielectric loss of power \ncables [8]. Therefore, the study of electrical properties on \nXLPE cables must include the influence of semicon shields, \nbecause they are essential part of the insulation system for \npower cables. \n \nIn this study, the XLPE homopolymer cables with two types \nof semicon layers, standard and supersmooth semicon \nmaterials, were measured with dielectric spectroscopy \ntechnique in order to find the loss origins of power cables. \nConductivity measurement of the semicon materials was also \ncarried out for explaining the loss tangent measurement. The \ninfluence of semicon layers on the dielectric loss of the cables \nwas investigated with equivalent circuit modelling.  \n \nII.   Experiment Setup \n \nTransformer ratio bridge technique was utilized in this study, \nas it has two main advantages over Schering bridge technique \nfor low-loss dielectric measurement: 1, impedances between \nthe unknown and earth do not affect the bridge balance so that \nlong screened leads and guarded electrodes can be used; 2, the \nvoltage transformer can be tapped accurately to obtain decade \nratios so that only a few standards are required. The \nmeasurement system is shown in Figure 1. Wayne Kerr \nuniversal bridge B221 was used together with signal generator \nas external source for the inductive bridge. The oscilloscope \nwas used to monitor the bridge balance. A tuned amplifier was \ndesigned to extend the accuracy range down to 300Hz. DC \nbattery was used to replace the mains power supply to drive \nthe bridge with further improvement against noises. The \nsystem frequency range was maximized to 300Hz~10kHz and \nit has sensitivity of 10\n-5\n for loss tangent measurement. \n \nThe XLPE model cables were produced by Borealis. They all \nhave the same homopolymer insulation layer of 1.5mm and \ntwo different semicon materials, which are called standard \nsemicon (cable AAA) and supersmooth semicon (cable BAB). \nThe cable samples were prepared with 5m length. They are \ndegassed at 80C for 5 days and put in an oven for \nmeasurement under different temperatures. Before \nmeasurement, the system was calibrated to cancel out the lead \neffect and background noises. The capacitance and \nconductance were measured on the cable samples.  \n \nSi gnal  gener at or Tr ansf or mer\nr at i o br i dge\nTuned ampl i f i er\nOsci l l oscope\nOven\nCabl e sampl e\n \nFigure 1 Transformer ratio bridge system setup \n \nThe measuring electrode was prepared in two different ways. \nAs a traditional method, the outer semicon layer was treated as \nmeasuring electrode [9][10]. The current was measured at a \nrandom point of the outer semicon shield along the cable, \nneglecting its axial resistance. After it was found that the axial \nresistance of outer semicon layer dominated in dielectric loss \nat higher frequencies, the cable samples were prepared in a \nbetter way. They were fully wrapped with copper tapes \neliminate the influence of semicon shield\u2019s axial resistance. \nThe resistivity of different semicon materials were also \nmeasured in order to explain and confirm the loss origin of \nsemicon shield. \n \nIII.   Results and Discussion \n \n  The measurement results on standard semicon cable sample \n(AAA) are shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3. From Figure 2, the \ndielectric loss tangent has increased at higher frequencies for \nall temperatures. Under lower temperatures up to 60C, the \nspectra have decreasing slopes below 3kHz. This implies two \ndielectric loss behaviour are present, while the second one \nbecame dominant when the temperature was higher. The \ndielectric loss of the cable AAA is about 10\n-3\n at 300Hz and \nrose to 3\u00d710\n-2\n at maximum. The temperature spectra in Figure \n3 shows that there is a peak at 90C for all frequencies. \n \n \nFigure 2 Frequency spectra of cable AAA \n \n \nFigure 3 Temperature spectra of cable AAA \n \n10\n3\n10\n4\n10\n-4\n10\n-3\n10\n-2\n10\n-1\n \n \nFrequency (Hz)\nL\no\ns\ns\n t\na\nn\ng\ne\nn\nt\n15C\n30C\n40C\n50C\n60C\n70C\n80C\n90C\n100C\n110C\n120C\n20 40 60 80 100 120\n10\n-4\n10\n-3\n10\n-2\n10\n-1\nTemperature (C)\nL\no\ns\ns\n t\na\nn\ng\ne\nn\nt\n \n \n300Hz\n400Hz\n600Hz\n1kHz\n2kHz\n3kHz\n4kHz\n6kHz\n10kHz\n20kHz\nThe measurement results on supersmooth semicon cable \nsample (BAB) are shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5. The \nfrequency spectra are very similar with those of cable AAA. \nThe shapes of temperature spectra are also similar, except that \nthe temperature of maximum loss tangent is at 100C. \n \n \nFigure 4 Frequency spectra of cable BAB \n \n \nFigure 5 Temperature spectra of cable BAB \n \nIn order to find the reasons for the increasing dielectric loss \nand the difference of loss peak temperatures, the DC \nresistivity measurement was carried out on these two different \nsemicon materials under various temperatures. In Figure 6, in \ncomparison with the temperature spectra in Figure 3 and \nFigure 5, the resistivities of semicon materials are plotted in \nsolid lines, together with loss tangent spectra of the cable \nsamples in dotted lines. Both semicon materials have \nresistivity peaks at 90C and 100C respectively. Their \nresistivities are from 1\u2126m and 100\u2126m. From the curves, the \ndielectric loss peaks for both cables have the same shapes as \nthe resistivity peaks for both semicon materials. This implies \nthat the axial resistance is the main contribution of the loss \ntangent for both types of cables. \n \nFigure 6 Comparison between resistivity measurement  \nand loss tangent measurement \n \nEquivalent circuit modelling was used to study the effects of \nsemicon layers on the dielectric loss of power cables. Instead \ncomplicated circuit networks to describe the power cables, \nFigure 7 shows the simplified equivalent circuits with semicon \nlayers, with only inner semicon layer and without the semicon \nlayers.

The pure \nconduction loss of the insulation layer without any semicon \nlayers has monotonic decreasing slope of -1. This DC \nconduction loss is not measurable at higher frequencies. It can \nonly be measured at very low frequencies due to instrument \nmeasuring limit. The radial resistance of both semicon layers \ncan cause the dielectric loss to increase at 200Hz, but it is \nbeyond the measurement limit. There is not much difference \nwhen the outer semicon is removed. However, the loss tangent \nbecomes much higher if there is series resistance due to the \ncontribution of the axial resistance of outer semicon layer. \nBecause the axial resistance is much bigger than the radial \nresistance for the outer semicon layer, the dielectric loss \ncontribution of the axial resistance is bigger and detectable at \nlower frequencies. This modelling results agree with the \nmeasurement data shown in Figure 2. \n \n \nFigure 8 Modelling results on the effect of semicon shields \n \n \nFigure 9 Comparison of the results from different sample \npreparation methods. (copper electrode: solid lines, semicon \nelectrodes: dotted lines) \n \nThe influence of semicon shields was diminished by using \nconductive adhesive copper tapes to fully wrap the cable \nsample AAA. From Figure 9, the loss tangent is smaller with \ncopper tape electrode. There is a loss peak in the beginning \nand this is probably due to relaxation process, because the DC \nconduction loss is beyond the measurement limit, according to \nmodelling results in Figure 8. \n \nIV.   Conclusion \n \nExperiments of triple extruded XLPE model cables have \ndemonstrated the importance of semicon layers in loss tangent \nmeasurements. The semicon layers of the XLPE cables have \nbeen found dominant in the dielectric loss in the frequency \nrange of 200Hz~20kHz when the outer semicon layer was not \nin good contact with measuring electrode. Resistivity \nmeasurement and equivalent circuit modelling provided the \nexplanations for the influence of outer semicon axial \nresistance. With totally wrapped electrode, the true loss of the \ncable insulation can be measured and the radial resistance of \nsemicon layers gave rise to loss tangent only at higher  \nfrequencies under higher temperatures. The results imply that \nthe AC power cables have extra dielectric loss origin from \nsemicon layers, compare with DC power cables, especially if \nthe outer semicon layers are not well earthed. \n \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \n \n  The authors appreciate the help on producing the XLPE \nmodel cables and support on the publication of this paper. \n \nREFERENCES \n \n[1]   C Broman, L Lindbom & U Nilsson, The continuing evolution of \nsemiconductive screening materials for power cable applications, 6th \nInternational Conference on Insulated Power Cables, Paris, 2003. \n[2]  Vahdat Vahedy, \u201cPolymer Insulated High Voltage Cables\u201d, IEEE \nElectrical Insulation Magazine, Vol. 22, No. 3, 2006. \n[3]  W.
