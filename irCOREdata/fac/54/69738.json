Introduction \nMobile phone is a \u2018must\u2019 have technology for \neveryone in the 21st century.  It has revolutionized \nbeyond its initial development as a tool for voice \ncommunication to transmitting data services and \nrecently, engaging itself to become a tool of digital \nentertainment. The marriage of PC and telecom \nnetworks has allowed the combination of data and \nvoice services, offering more personalised and \nsophisticated services such as SMS text messaging, \nMMS or picture messaging, searching for real-time \ninformation, enabling a range of location-based \nservices and mobile Internet.  The most popular mobile \nservice is SMS with approximately 70 percent of \nmobile users adopted this service [2]. \nThe latest mobile services that are gaining interests \nfrom younger generation are digital music and mobile \ngaming.  It is argued that digital music represents \napproximately 6 percent of overall music sales [3].  In \n2005, the number of single tracks downloaded has \ndoubled from previous year to 420 million single tracks \nall around the world.  In the UK, 26.4 million single \ntracks were downloaded in 2005 as compared to only \n5.8 million in 2004.   In contrast, the sales of CD single \nand video games consoles are declining.  For example, \nin Japan, the use of i-mode mobile phones operating \nover the 3G networks has encouraged millions of \nsubscriber to download songs and videos directly to \ntheir mobile phone [4]. \nDue to the fact digital content like digital music is \neasily available and widely access through digital \ndevices including mobile phones, it becomes \nincreasingly vulnerable to illegal and unauthorised \nactivities.  This has raised the issue of Digital Right \nManagement (DRM).  It signifies the concern over the \nexploitation of content of digital files.  Indeed, security \nhas always been and will continue to be one of the \ngreatest challenges pose by mobile devices particularly \nfor content providers as digital media becomes \nincreasingly popular.  In Western Europe, \u00a37.6 billion \nwere generated from the premium content [5].  \nTherefore, it is crucial to address this issue in order to \nprotect interests of every component in the industry \nincluding mobile phone manufacturers, network \noperators, content providers and also consumers. \nThis paper presents an overview of existing \nSymbian version 8.0 DRM and TrustZone architecture. \nThen, it discusses how the two technologies can be \nemployed to improve security of mobile phone services \nand concludes with an application example of digital \nE-Pass solution. \n2. Symbian version 8 and DRM \nProceedings of the International Conference on Mobile Business (ICMB\u201906) \n0-7695-2595-4\/06 $20.00 \u00a9 2006 IEEE \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

With the demand for \ngrowth and success on mobile entertainment services, \nit is important to evaluate the existing DRM system.  \nDRM is an abbreviation for Digital Right Management \nthat defines the technical methods used to control or \nrestrict the use of digital media content on electronic \ndevices.  Due to the fact that the content of digital \nmedia can be easily duplicated and disseminated, it has \nthreatened the viability and profitability of the media \nindustry and has caused a serious breach of the \ncopyright law.  In order to strengthen security of \nmobile devices and reduce vulnerability of digital files, \nSymbian has incorporated the DRM system into its \noperating system. \nIn Symbian version 8 operating system, DRM \nLicense Manager is introduced to protect and allow the \nusage of rights enforcement for native applications. It \nconsists of functions assisting the installation of \nprotected applications and checking of usage rights. \nThe protections mechanisms for applications differ but \nthey share a common packaging process. The \nprotection is based on the standard Open Mobile \nAlliance (OMA) Digital Rights Management which \nprovides and establishes framework for content \npackaging, content distribution and rights management.  \nThis enables application developers to specify usage \nconditions for applications that are defined in the OMA \nDRM standard and can include count-based constraints \nand time-based usage constraints [6].  \nSymbian DRM License Manager is implemented \nbased on two principles namely application execution \nwhich is regulated through a license and protection of \nvital application data using encryption method.  The \nfirst principle works by executing an application \nthrough a license that must be presented and validated. \nThe second principle suggests that it should increase \nthe protection level due to encrypted application data \n[6]. \nFigure 1 shows how the application file is \nprotected by packaging files using Protected \nInstallation Package (PIP) that keeps all application \nfiles for the purpose of installation in DRM Container \nFile (DCF) format. It can have more than one Data \nFile, each contains vital program information and is \nencrypted upon installation zipped together with \nDefinition File and SIS File. Definition file is a file \ncontaining information about the data files to be \nprotected. DRM protection works in this scenario by \ntransferring PIP file to the terminal as an OMA DRM \nfile or as an OMA DRM message. This could be one of \nthe chosen content distribution models, for example \nOMA Forward Lock, Combined Delivery or Separate \nDelivery [6]. \nHowever, like many other software solutions, \nencrypted files are still possible to be unscrambled and \nmanipulated. Therefore, measures should be taken to \nimprove security of the application files to protect the \nrights of content owners.  \nIn Symbian version 9, it is said that ARM ABI \n(Application Binary Interface) will be used which \nmeans ARM core architecture will allow Symbian OS \nto utilize the speed advantages offered by ARM chips. \nIt will also support multimedia files, audio and video \n[6]. ARM microprocessor is capable of implementing \nTrustZone technology within the core hardware \narchitecture [8].\n3. ARM TrustZone technology \nOperating systems are by their very nature open \nand complex system and very difficult to secure. This \nmakes the devices used as part of the mobile \napplications infrastructure vulnerable to many forms of \nattack. TrustZone introduces security structure by \nproviding a separate secure domain to provide on-\ndevice security protection to ensure data integrity.

Restrictions apply.\nsystemize the implementation of secure systems, it uses \na hardware-enforced security domain to the core \narchitecture and memory system.  In other words, it \nisolates part of the chip architecture purely for secure \ninformation. It also disassociates system security from \ncomplex non-secure applications as illustrated in \nFigure 2 [8]. This means devices are capable of storing \nnon-secure data and sensitive information separately \nwithin the secure domain in the structure. This can be \ndeployed in the E-Pass employing DRM in Symbian v8 \nOS and TrustZone solution. The later part of this paper \nwill explain how TrustZone technology can be used to \nenhance security in mobile applications.\n4. Technical overview of proposed \nsolution \nIt is anticipated that the integration of Symbian \nDRM and TrustZone architecture on ARM devices will \nimprove security of mobile devices.  In this \nrecommendation, the application installation process \nwill be restricted.  Every time an application is \ninstalled, the DRM License Manager opens the \nprotected PIP file using license file (OMA DRM Right \nobject) that is stored in the TrustZone.  Then, it installs \nthe SIS file that is contained in PIP file.  Finally, the \nDRM License Manager encrypts and stores any data \nfile referenced properly in the PIP file in TrustZone. To \nensure that the installation process is transparent to the \nuser, the stages are integrated into the regular \ninstallation procedure.  \nFigure 3 illustrates the recommended solution.  \nBasically, the definition file, data file and the OMA\nDRM Rights License file are stored in the secure \nenvironment. Vital application data file contains \nsensitive data related to application, for example data \ncontrolling the application logic, media files, games \nlevels and many more. In the current Symbian DRM \nsolution, this data is available in files format to be \nencrypted and protected.   In the proposed solution, the \ndata is secured in the Trusted Code Base area adding \nsecondary security level and therefore, maintaining the \ncontent originality.  Any attempt to modify the files for \nduplication purposes will be impossible and installation \nprocess will be incomplete. \nAnother method of installing the application \nwithout having the right ownership and   license is by \nremoving the license file checker.  In order to restrict \nthis process, the license file checker is installed in the \nTrusted Code Base.  Any unauthorized activities will \nbe denied because the license file checker is not \naccessible.  Only manufacturer will have the rights to \nalter or delete this file. Indeed, TrustZone coupled with \nSymbian DRM creates another layer of securing \napplication on mobile phones. This will prevent such   \napplication to be copied and installed on other mobile \ndevices by unauthorized parties. Only authorized user \nis able to install applications on mobile phones and \nadditional installation of the application on multiple \ndevices will be restricted unless granted by the mobile \nphone\u2019s manufacturer and\/or network provider. This \nwill no doubt benefits the providers of digital media in \nmobile phones industry. \nFixed Entry \nPoints \nPrivileged \nNormal \nFixed Entry \nPoints \nMonitor\nTrusted Code base \nSecure Kernel \nPlatform \nOS \nA\np\np\nA\np\np\nA\np\np\nS\n-\nA\np\np\nS\n-\nA\np\np\nFigure 2.

The \npurpose of this solution is to give rights to user and \ntheme park operator to acknowledge one another by \nhaving a fully trusted E-Pass on mobile phone core \nhardware.  \nFigure 4. Structure of E-Pass system with Symbian \nDRM and TrustZone solution\nA user browses the internet using a Symbian v8 OS  \nmobile phone and selects a theme park and a preferred \ndate. The E-Pass is a date-based and only valid for a \nspecific date for a theme park visit therefore a proof of \npurchase must be easily identified for both user and \ntheme park operator.  \nOnce the user agreed with the terms and conditions, \nthe user then makes a payment using mobile phone. \nThe process of sending the user\u2019s information is done \nbased on standard Internet security protocol, Secure \nSocket Layer (SSL) that applies standard 128-bit \ndecryption over a wireless line. At this stage, the user \nsends the details to purchase the E-Pass to the theme \npark\u2019s operator terminal. The user can make payment \ndirectly to his credit\/debit card or billing the amount of \nthe ticket purchased to user\u2019s network provider or \ndeduct user\u2019s prepaid amount. \nUpon receiving the request of E-Pass from the user, \nthe theme park operator then sends an encrypted E-\nPass electronically to the user. Then, the encryption \nkey is sent to the operator by the user\u2019s mobile phone.\nThe theme park operator sends an encryption key to \nTrustZone on the user\u2019s mobile phone to enable the \nuser to open ticket details. The operator should have a \nlist of \u201ctrusted digital E-Pass(es)\u201c which is processed \nusing mobile phones with TrustZone technology. This \nenables the protection of on and off-chip memory and \nperipherals from software attack. The security elements \nof the system are designed into the core hardware, \ntherefore there is no issue of E-Pass being tampered \n[8]. Hence, E-Pass validity is undoubtedly original. \nBy using the encryption key stored in TrustZone, \nthe user can open and check the E-Pass details \nincluding unique E-Pass number, time and date of \npurchased, date of entrance and amount paid. Once the \nuser satisfies and agrees with the information, the user \nsends acknowledgement to the theme park operator. \nThe E-Pass details will be used in the encryption \nprocess in order for the merchant to create a new \nencryption key if required for validation. In this \nprocess, vital data such as unique E-Pass number is \nstored in the secure trusted code based TrustZone PIP \nfile while others can still remain in OS. This process \nseparates vital data and other application data. \nThe user then, passes the encrypted ticket to get \naccess into the theme park by connecting their mobile \nphone to the terminal available at the counter via \ninfrared or Bluetooth. This verifies the digital E-Pass \nstored in the TrustZone. The operator then prints out \nthe physical E-Pass\/receipt to the user or provides an \ninstant access to the E-Pass holder. \nE-Pass is maintained encrypted within the user\u2019s \nmobile phone. The ticket details are still available and \naccessible and will enable the merchant to verify the \nencrypted E-Pass should they lost the information from \ntheir system.  \n4.2 Potential benefits of proposed system\nWith the deployment of the TrustZone technology \nwithin a mobile phone, it is expected that the security \nof Symbian mobile phones will improve significantly \nparticularly in the Symbian DRM content protection.  \nAt the moment, the only security that protects the \nSymbian DRM solution is dependent on the present of \nlicense and data encryption method.  By introducing \nthe TrustZone technology within mobile phone \nhardware, it adds another layer of security that gives \non-device protection.

Unlike many encryptions security \nsoftware in the market, TrustZone will not allow \ninformation kept in a mobile phone to be attacked by \nviruses and intruders to falsify the information. \n The integration of Symbian DRM and Trustzone \nnot only adds another layer of security but also remains \ntransparent to the end user because the data is stored in \na secure domain within the operating system. As this \nsecurity protection happens in the background, user \nnever sees the add-on security and gives no different \nwhatsoever from user\u2019s point of view. In addition, it \nwill have no effect on the performance because the \nTrustZone works within the core hardware level.  \n5. Conclusion \nAs mobile phone penetration increases, mobile \nusers are demanding a wider range of mobile services.  \nAs a result, mobile phone has become not only a tool \nfor social communication but also as a device for \npersonal digital entertainment. This has raised the \nconcern over security of mobile services particularly, \nDRM.  This paper has discussed methods to provide \nbetter security in mobile devices by reviewing and \nimplementing Symbian DRM and TruztZone solution \nin a theme park entrance using secured E-Pass. The \nintegration of these two technologies will provide \nadded on-device security protection. It will also reduce \nsignificant amount of losses by preventing illegal \ndistribution and copies of digital media content. \nIndeed, the proposed solution will protect the rights of \ndigital content owners and at the same time bring \ntangible and intangible benefits to all parties involved \nincluding consumers, network providers and digital \nmedia suppliers and distributors.  \n6.
