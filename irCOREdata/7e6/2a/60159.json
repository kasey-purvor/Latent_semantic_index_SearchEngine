The majority of this dissolved organic carbon is likely  to  be  in  the  form  of  humic  and  fulvic\nacids.  These are complex, natural organic compounds that are responsible for much of the brown colour in\nnatural waters.\nLandfill leachate has a high content of DOC,  particularly  in  developing  countries  where  the  putrescible\ncontent of waste is high (Figure  1).   This  wastewater  gives  rise  to  a  complex  mixture  of  \u2018humic-like\u2019\norganic acids, together with  phenols,  aromatic  hydrocarbons,  terpenes,  proteins  and  lignins  originating\nfrom decomposing plant material (Reinhard et al., 1984; Weis  et  al.,  1989;  Lyngekilde  and  Christensen,\n1992). The high  molecular  weight  acids  are  yellow-brown  in  colour  and  have  acidic  functionality  of\nseveral ?mol mg-1 DOC (Weis et al, 1989). They differ from  soil  derived  humic  substances  in  generally\nhaving  lower  oxygen  content,  phenolic  group  content  and  molecular   weight.   Xenobiotics   are   also\nproduced, for example phthalates, by the decomposition of PVC (Mersiowsky et al, 1999).\nWastewater may contain a wide and variable range of identifiable organic compounds (BGS et  al,\n1998). But these  form  only  a  small  fraction  of  the  total  organic  loading  wastewater-affected\ngroundwater (Peters et al, 1994). This organic loading can be difficult to  quantify  reliably  where\nsites are remote from analytical facilities, especially taking into account the limited stability of the\nsample. A further  problem  is  that  the  DOC  measurement  is  frequently  difficult  to  reproduce\nbetween laboratories. An analogue indicator of DOC would therefore be of benefit.\nTrihalomethane formation\nDissolved organic material can react with chlorine during  water  disinfection  for  potable  supply  to  form\ntrihalomethanes (THMs, haloforms).  For  effective  disinfection  an  excess  of  chlorine  over  the  sample\nconsumption is needed and this free chlorine can react with organic compounds present in the water during\nstorage or distribution of the treated water.  The THM compounds most commonly formed are  chloroform,\nbromodichloromethane, chlorodibromomethane, and bromoform (Hutton and Chung, 1994).  Owing  to  its\nhigh reactivity, chlorine reacts very rapidly with many natural  organic  compounds  present  in  raw  water.\nThere is concern that the reuse of renovated water with an enhanced  organic  load  may  lead  to  increased\nhaloform production  during  chlorination.  However,  there  is  some  evidence  that  polar  high  molecular\nweight natural organic material, such as humic acids, rather than anthropogenic organic compounds are the\npreferred precursors (Alawi et al, 1994).  This agrees with the observed correlation of haloform  production\nwith fluorescence properties of water (Ibarluzea, 1994) and with its aromatic carbon content (Harrington  et\nal, 1996).\nThe type and relative amounts of chlorination by-products vary  with  chlorine  concentration,  the\nconcentration of organic precursor compounds, pH, temperature, and  contact  time  (Alawi  et  al,\n1994).  Bromide, often present in raw water, from either natural or anthropogenic  sources  has  an\nimportant effect  on  the  speciation  of  any  THMs  produced.   During  chlorination,  bromide  is\noxidized by chlorine to bromine and chlorination and bromination become  competitive  reactions.\nBromine appears to be more effective as a halogen-substituting agent and,  if  bromine  acts  as  an\noxidant, it will be reduced to the bromide ion, which may then be  re-oxidised  by  chlorine.   This\nresults in a high bromine incorporation into the THMs and may account for the mutagenic activity\nof chlorinated waters which cannot be solely ascribed to chloroform (Peters, 1994).  However  the\npresence of ammonia at concentrations as low as 1 mg l-1 inhibits haloform  formation  by  competing\nfor  reaction  sites  on  the  organic  molecules  (Denne,  1984).   Ammonia  is   generally   present   at   low\nconcentrations in unpolluted groundwater, but is high in domestic wastewater and  can  be  high  in  landfill\nleachates (Robinson, 1996; Stuart & Klinck, 1998).\nMiller et al (1993) considered the fate of THMs during the artificial recharge and recovery of treated water.\n THMs may be formed during  the  initial  treatment  process  and  then  not  completely  attenuated  during\nrecharge and storage, or during chlorination of recovered water.  For example Miller et al (1993) found that\nrecharge of the Las Vegas aquifer with  treated  water  from  the  Colorado  river  could  be  relied  upon  to\nabsorb either the chloro-organic components or the THM precursor materials from the treated water.\nMeasurement of trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP) is a  standard  test,  where  water  is\nbuffered at pH 7, dosed with an excess of chlorine and held  for  7  days  at  25\u00b0C  (APHA,  1992).\nTHMFP is expressed in terms of chloroform equivalents using the equation:\nTHMFP =  A + 0.728B + 0.574C + 0.472D\nwhere   A   =   chloroform   concentration,   B   =   dichlorobromomethane   concentration,    C    =\nchlorodibromomethane concentration and D = bromoform concentration (APHA, 1992).  THMFP\nhas been shown to be proportional to the 24-hour  test  used  to  simulate  THM  concentrations  in\nsupplied water (Hutton and Chung, 1987).\nFor sources with a uniform type of DOC, THM formation should be directly  related  to  the  DOC\nconcentration (Amy  et  al.,  1987).   This  paper  examines  the  potential  of  using  THMFP  as  a\nsurrogate test for organic loading of groundwater polluted by domestic wastes, landfill leachate  or\nwastewater. This would allow DOC concentration in various types of polluted groundwater  to  be\nestimated from a knowledge of the THMFP.\nSite descriptions\nThe  proposed  method  was  applied   to   groundwater   from   a   number   of   sites   from   three\nindustrialising countries where the groundwater  was  known  to  be  contaminated  by  infiltrating\nwastewater or landfill leachate (Table 1).  Sites were also selected on the basis  of  the  availability\nof nearby piezometers or shallow dug wells  suitable  for  taking  groundwater  samples.   Samples\nwere also taken from local potable supply boreholes, other  abstraction  points  and  from  the  raw\nwastewater but not generally from the raw leachate.\n1 Le\u00f3n, Mexico\nLeon is one of the most important centres in Latin America for leather processing and shoe  manufacturing.\nIt is situated in a semi-arid intermontane valley about 300 km northwest of  Mexico  City.   All  wastewater\nfrom the city is collected into six open channels and carried untreated into the adjacent irrigation area  by  a\ncomplex canal system. Some water is used  directly  for  irrigation  of  crops,  whilst  the  remainder  passes\nthrough one or more storage lagoons before being used.\nThis scheme has been operating for more than 40 years and infiltrating  wastewater  has  formed  a\nnew shallow aquifer, with very  poor  water  quality,  beneath  the  irrigation  area.   A  number  of\nshallow  irrigation  wells  draw  water  from  this   aquifer.   The   city   is   highly   dependent   on\ngroundwater for potable supply and one of the  main  wellfields  abstracts  from  a  deeper  aquifer\nwithin the complex volcanic and alluvial deposits below the  irrigation  area.   This  abstraction  is\ncausing poorer quality water to be drawn down and water supplied to the city  is  beginning  to  be\naffected.  This site is described in more detail in Stuart and Milne (1997), Chilton et al (1998)  and\nBGS (1998).\n2 Mezquital, Mexico\nThe  Mezquital  Valley  also  has  a  semi-arid  climate.   It  currently  receives  some  70%  of  the\nwastewater produced by Mexico City (about 40 m3 s-1).  This water is transported for more than 30 km\nin  tunnels  and  used  directly  to  irrigate  more  than  45,000  ha  of  previously  unproductive  land.    The\ndistribution scheme has been developed for over 100 years and is  now  very  complex  with  several  major\nimpoundments, and many interconnected main and lateral canals.\nWidespread and prolonged wastewater irrigation has completely modified the groundwater system\nwith water levels now being very close  to  the  surface  and  substantial  areas  of  land  subject  to\nwaterlogging.  In effect a new aquifer has been created within  the  valley  which  forms  the  main\nsource of potable water for some 500,000 residents in the valley. However  the  wastewater  origin\nof the groundwater means that many supplies do not meet  the  Mexican  Drinking  Water  Limits.\nWater quality appears  to  be  slowly  deteriorating  under  the  present  irrigation  regime.  Further\ndetails are given in CNA et al (1998) and BGS et al (1998).\n3 Wadi Dhuleil, Jordan\nThe Khirbet As Samra wastewater treatment plant serving  Amman  is  situated  in  Wadi  Dhuleil,\nsome  42  km  northeast  of  Amman.   This  plant  consists  of  a  series  of  ponds  (oxidation  and\nfacultative) with a combined area of 181 ha.  The treated water is discharged to Wadi Dhuleil  and\nis of poor quality since the organic loading of the wastewater exceeds  the  plant  design  capacity.\nThe climate is semi-arid so there is little wadi baseflow.\nWater is drawn off along the wadi down stream of the plant for small-scale irrigation and the wadi\nflow becomes progressively poorer and more saline due to irrigation returns.  Groundwater  in  the\nunderlying limestone aquifer has been affected by infiltration both from the treatment plant  ponds\nand leakage from the wadi bed.  The quality deterioration is exacerbated  by  over  abstraction  for\nirrigation with the  consequent  drawing  down  of  shallow  poor  quality  water  into  the  aquifer.\nFurther details are given in BGS et al (1998).\n4 Hat Yai, Thailand\nHat Yai is the third largest city in Thailand and is  situated  at  the  southern  end  of  the  Thailand\npeninsula.   The  climate  is  tropical-humid  with  high  but  strongly  seasonal  rainfall.   The  city\noccupies a low-lying valley underlain by  thick  Quaternary  and  Recent  sediments.   This  valley\ncontains a sequence of aquifers separated by clay semi-confining layers and Hat Yai obtains about\n55% of its urban water supply from groundwater.\nUrban wastewater is disposed directly to a canal which passes through the city centre. Because  of\nheavy abstraction of groundwater at depth in  the  city  centre,  a  cone  of  depression  has  formed\nbeneath the city.   This has lead to relatively poor quality water thought to originate from the canal\npenetrating the aquifer system.  Shallow water quality is now extremely poor with low  redox  and\nhigh concentrations of ammonium.  Further details are given in Gooddy et al (1997) and BGS et al\n(1998).\n5 Dzitya, Mexico\nThe village of Dzitya is situated to the northwest of the city of M\u00e9rida  in  the  Yucatan  peninsula,\nMexico.  In common with the city there is  no  mains  drainage,  and  wastewater  from  the  1,100\ninhabitants is disposed to the ground using septic tanks  and  cesspits.   The  Yucatan  peninsula  is\nformed from low-lying karst limestone with a shallow water table and groundwater  is  considered\nto be extremely vulnerable to pollution (Gonz\u00e1les Herrera, 1996).\nMost properties in the village have a dug well for irrigation of smallholdings and water for limited\nnumbers of stock. Some people also use this water for drinking after informal chlorination.   Piped\npotable water is provided from a borehole also in the village.\n6 Merida, Mexico\nUp until 1998 the city of M\u00e9rida was served by a single large landfill site situated to the northwest\nbetween the city  and  the  village  of  Dzitya.   This  accepted  municipal,  medical  and  industrial\nwastes, both solid and liquid.  The site was not engineered and consists of a series of waste  layers\ncovered with fine material derived from the waste.  The  climate  is  tropical-humid  and  therefore\nlarge amounts of leachate are generated from the waste.  It  was  calculated  that  13,000  m3  could\nhave been produced annually (Klinck & Stuart, 1999). There is no  provision  for  leachate  containment  or\ntreatment and all leachate infiltrates to the ground. A plume of contaminated groundwater can  be  detected\nunder the site and a few hundred metres to the northwest. Further  information  can  be  found  in  Gonz\u00e1les\nHerrera (1996, Klinck et al (1997) and Klinck & Stuart (1999).\n7 Tha Muang, Thailand\nSolid wastes  (some  3.5  tonnes  per  day)  from  the  small  town  of  Tha  Muang,  Kanchanaburi\nprovince, central Thailand, are disposed to a walled compound about 100 m square.  The  site  has\nbeen in use  for  about  30  years.  There  is  evidence  that  the  wastes,  which  have  a  very  high\nputrescible content, are burnt on a  regular  basis  to  reduce  waste  volume.   Pleistocene  gravels,\nsands and silts in the basin of the Mae Klong river underlie the site.\nThe site is surrounded by houses and irrigated fields.  Local groundwater from shallow  dug  wells\nis used for crop irrigation, fish farming and for informal  potable  supply.   Further  details  can  be\nfound in Klinck et al (1999) and Klinck & Stuart (1999).\n8 Mae Hia, Thailand\nThe Mae Hia waste disposal site served the major city of Chiang Mai  in  northern  Thailand  from\n1958 to 1989.   The  site  was  closed  after  complaints  from  local  residents  about  groundwater\npollution and vermin.  A mixture of filling, with soil  cover,  and  open  dumping  disposed  waste.\nThe site is now soil covered although a leachate lagoon  remains  within  the  original  dump  area.\nThe site is situated on a sequence of Quaternary colluvial deposits consisting  of  sand  and  gravel\nlayers interbedded with clayey units.\nApproximately 100 houses exist in the vicinity of the site.  Originally water supply was  from  dug\nwells into the colluvial aquifer.  The water level is shallow (between 0.5 and 10 metres).  Many of\nthese wells are only used  for  irrigation,  cleaning  and  cooking  because  of  poor  water  quality.\nKarnchanawong et al (1996) identified a persistent plume  of  contaminated  groundwater  moving\neastwards  from  the  site.   Further  details   can   be   found   in   Karnchanawong   et   al   (1996),\nKarnchanawong et al (1999), Klinck et al (1999) and Klinck & Stuart (1999).\nSample collection and analytical procedures\nSamples were collected directly in pre-cleaned amber glass  bottles  with  PTFE-lined  screw  caps\nfor THMFP and HDPE bottles for bromide and  ammonium,  and  filtered  through  0.45  (m  silver\nmembranes into chromic acid washed glass vials for DOC determination.\nFor THMFP determination the method uses  three  principal  reagents:  a  dosing  solution  (50  ml\nsodium hypochlorite solution  having  4-20%  available  chlorine  made  up  to  250  ml);  a  pH  7\nphosphate buffer (6.81 g potassium dihydrogen phosphate and 1.17 g sodium hydroxide dissolved\nin 100 ml); and a quenching solution (10% sodium  sulphite).   All  reagents  were  made  up  with\n\u2018Milli Q\u2019 grade water.  30 ml of the solution to be chlorinated was placed in  a  40-ml  vial  with  a\nPTFE septum and a screw cap.  1 ml of dosing solution and 1 ml of phosphate buffer  were  added\nand the sample stored at 25oC for 7 days.  1 ml of sodium sulphite was added to prevent further  reaction\nand the vials refrigerated until analysis.\nAnalyses for THMs were carried out using a gas  chromatograph  fitted  with  an  OV-101  packed\ncolumn and an electron capture detector.  The flow rate was adjusted to 25 ml\/min  of  nitrogen  to\nelute all compounds of interest within 10  minutes.   3  ml  of  sample  were  extracted  with  2  ml\npentane and a 3 (l aliquot injected onto the column.  Standards were prepared in the range  0-80  (g l-1  for\neach component using the EPA 601 trihalomethanes mix (200 (g\/ml in methanol). Procedural  and  method\nblanks were also run at regular intervals.\nDOC was analysed using a TOCSIN II aqueous organic  carbon  analyser.   Briefly,  the  inorganic\ncarbon is first purged with  nitric  acid,  before  pyrolysis  of  the  remaining  organic  carbon  in  a\nfurnace at 900\u00b0C.  The carbon dioxide produced is hydrogenated over a catalyst and  converted  to\nmethane which is then passed into a flame ionisation detector.  Calibration solutions  are  prepared\nusing a potassium hydrogen phthalate (KHP) stock solution and made using a  range  of  standards\nfrom 0-15 mg l-1 and cross checked with a 10 mg l-1 standard made from  a  glucose  stock  solution.   All\nsamples were diluted so as to fall in the calibration range, some samples needed to be diluted  by  up  to  20\ntimes.\nResults\n1 Dissolved Organic Carbon\nThe results for DOC in wastewater-affected areas clearly reflect the differences in  organic  content  of  the\ninfiltrating wastewaters and the local climate (Table  2).   In  Le\u00f3n,  where  the  wastewater  is  discharged\ndirectly to the cultivated area adjacent to the city boundaries, the carbon content of the water  is  extremely\nhigh (42 - 265 mg\/l).   This is probably due  both  to  the  semi-arid  climate  and  to  discharge  of  tannery\nwastes with a high organic content as well as domestic wastewater (Stuart  and  Milne,  1997).   The  mean\nconcentration is reduced slightly by the lower concentration  of  DOC  in  water  leaving  the  first  storage\nlagoon.\nThe organic carbon contents of  wastewater  reaching  Wadi  Dhuleil  and  Mezquital  are  similar.\nThese wastewaters both come from cities in relatively arid areas, which produce mainly  domestic\nwastes.  In both cases, wastewater is transported over a considerable distance before  reaching  the\ndischarge area.  In Hat Yai, Thailand where the climate is much wetter,  the  effluent  in  the  canal\nwater is much more dilute.  Since wastewater is discharged directly to the canals in the study  area\n(Gooddy et al, 1997), this low concentration must be due to dilution by storm water.\nOnce water has entered the subsurface, the differences  in  the  carbon  content  of  the  infiltrating\nwater appear to be less important.  The  results  of  this  study  indicate  that  the  DOC  content  of\ngroundwater affected by infiltrating wastewater is  surprisingly  uniform  and  is  generally  in  the\nrange 3  - 9 mg l-1.  This contrasts with \u2018natural\u2019 concentrations of <2 mg l-1.\nThe DOC does show some correlation with other components  of  the  wastewater.   For  example,\nFigure  2  shows  the  relationship  with  chloride  for  both  wastewaters  and  groundwaters  from\nwastewater infiltration sites.   The Le\u00f3n wastewaters have both the highest carbon and the  highest\nchloride content.  Wastewaters from Amman and the Rio Salado, Mezquital have a similar ratio to\nLe\u00f3n.  Le\u00f3n wastewater contains high concentrations of chloride derived from importation of salt-\ndressed hides for  tanning  (Stuart  &  Milne,  1997).   The  Rio  Salado  in  Mezquital  has  always\ncontained relatively saline water.  Amman wastewater may be saline due to  the  arid  climate  and\nthe relatively high chloride concentration in the city water supply.   Wastewater  from  the  Emisor\nCentral in Mezquital has much  lower  chloride  and  may  be  more  typical  of  domestic  effluent\n(CNA et al, 1998).\nAs these wastes infiltrate to groundwater, the  combined  impact  of  organic  degradation  and  evaporation\nchange the relationship completely.  Many of the groundwaters contain higher  chloride  contents  than  the\noriginal wastewater.  This is most extreme for Amman, where the groundwater chloride concentrations  are\nup to 5 times greater than the concentrations in the wastewater.\nFor leachate-impacted groundwaters the chloride concentrations detected in the groundwater are higher and\nrange from 6 to 24 mg l-1.  The highest concentrations were detected in  M\u00e9rida,  Mexico,  where  the  large\nwaste  disposal  site  is  situated  on  karstic  limestone  with  a  shallow   water   table.    Very   high   DOC\nconcentrations   were   found   in   groundwater   samples   from   within   the   landfill   boundary.    Lower\nconcentrations were found in Mae Hia, Thailand, where the disposal site had been closed and covered  with\nsoil for some eight years prior to this study.\n2 THM formation\nThe  rate  of  formation  of  THMs  was  measured  in  two  samples  taken   from   the   plume   of\ncontaminated groundwater close to the site at Mae Hia over a period of 10  days.   The  results  for\none of these are shown in  Figure  3.   THMs  were  formed  rapidly  under  the  chlorine-saturated\nconditions used.  After 1 day concentrations reached 60% and after 2 days reached 75% of the full\nTHMFP measurement (7 days).   This is more rapid  than  observed  by  Hutton  &  Chung  (1994)\nwho found the 1 day THM concentration to be only 30% of the THMFP, although  the  1  day  test\nwas performed under slightly different conditions.\nThe THMFP test is therefore likely to be reasonably  representative  of  the  informal  chlorination\nprocedures used by individual water users at these types of sites.  In these cases, drinking water  is\nsaturated with chlorine before  use,  either  in  jerrycans  or  from  a  container  of  chlorine  tablets\nsuspended in the well.  The results found here are therefore considered to be acceptable for use  in\na health risk assessment for drinking groundwater from these sites.\nThe dominant trihalomethane formed was chloroform, comprising the largest proportion of the total THMs\nin   85%   of   samples.    Chloroform   was   found   to   be   present   in   all   of    the    samples    as    was\nbromodichloromethane.  Bromoform was the least commonly detected THM (none was found in any of the\nsites in Hat Yai) and found in only 28 % of samples.  However, bromoform  was  detected  in  most  of  the\ngroundwaters tested around Amman, reflecting the high concentrations of bromide present.\nThe  results  for  the  THMFP  are  summarised   in   Table   3.    The   THMFP   is   very   low   in\nuncontaminated water  (<25 \u00b5g l-1), but is clearly increased in contaminated groundwater with most sites\nhaving mean concentrations of between 100 and 300 \u00b5g l-1.  The exceptions are the landfill sites of M\u00e9rida,\nwhere the THMFP is very high, and Tha Muang where the THMFP is scarcely  above  background.   These\nexceptions are discussed in section x.\n3 Relationship with DOC\nThere is a clear positive relationship between THMFP and DOC concentration for each site. As an\nexample, data from Mae Hia is shown in Figure 4.  The \u2018reactivity\u2019 of the DOC  can  be  estimated\nfrom  the  slope  of  the  relationship  between  THMFP  and  DOC.  Table 4  gives   the   differing\nreactivity of the DOC at the different sites.\nThere  are  definite  differences  between   the   groundwaters   and   wastewaters.    The   THMFP\ndetermination was not generally carried out for the leachates. Groundwater DOC tends  to  have  a\nreactivity of between 20 and 31 ?g mg-1. Exceptions to this are  Mezquital  (38  ?g mg-1),  Wadi  Dhuleil\n(45 ?g mg-1) and Tha Muang (about 2 ?g mg-1).\nDOC reactivity for the wastewaters was much more variable.  Wastewater from Le\u00f3n  has  a  very\nlow  reactivity  averaging  just  2.8 ?g mg-1  and  Wadi  Dhuleil   wastewaters   are   also   low   (around\n10 ?g mg-1). The single leachate measured was also very low (1.2   ?g mg-1).   Wastewater  from  Mezquital\nhas a very similar reactivity to the groundwater (27 ?g mg-1), whereas the wastewater in  Hat  Yai  is  much\nmore reactive than the groundwater with an average of 42 ?g mg-1. Some  explanation  can  be  found  from\nthe other components in the wastewaters or leachates.\nJiang et al (1998) showed that the  formation  of  the  individual  THMs  in  groundwater  used  for  potable\nsupply in Cincinnati could be  modelled  as  first  order  reactions  depending  only  on  TOC  concentration\nexcept for bromoform formation which  was  not  well  represented  by  this  approach.  Both  bromide  and\nammonium are known to affect the rate of THM formation from organic matter, in  addition  to  the  degree\nof humification.  Additionally ageing of the wastewater arrears to result in increased \u2018DOC reactivity\u2019.\nBromide\nHutton and Chung (1994) showed that bromine incorporation is rapid early on with the initial  rate\nrelated to the bromide concentration. The rate is  limited  at  high  bromine  concentrations  by  the\nnumber of available halogenation sites on the organic molecule.  Eventually  a  saturation  level  is\nreached with three bromine atoms being incorporated into each THM. This means that  bromide  can\nhave a catalytic effect on the overall THMFP, as well as producing enhanced concentrations of  brominated\nproducts (Peters et al, 1994).\nFormation of brominated THMs was related to the concentration of bromine in  the  groundwater  at  all  of\nthe sites studied (Figure 5). The largest bromide concentrations were found  in  the  groundwaters  of  Wadi\nDhuleil and Mezquital. This is reflected in the high percentage of brominated products (Table 4). \nAmmonium\nIn, contrast,  ammonium  inhibits  the  reaction  by  competing  for  reaction  sites  on  the  organic\nmaterial (Denne et al, 1984).  It may also react directly with chlorine, reducing the  concentrations\navailable to react with the organic matter.  Both the Le\u00f3n and Wadi  Dhuleil  wastewaters  contain\nhigh concentrations of ammonium (>70 mg l-1), as does the Merida leachate (511 mg l-1).   These  high\nconcentrations may contribute to the apparent lack of carbon  reactivity.   Concentrations  are  of  ammonia\nare lower in the canals of Hat Yai and Mezquital since they are well aerated and DOC reactivities are in the\nsame range as for groundwater DOC.\nAgeing of DOC\nThe wastewaters  in  Mezquital  and  Wadi  Dhuleil  had  been  transported  for  20-30  km  before\ndischarge and the ageing of the DOC during the period  of  transfer  may  have  contributed  to  an\nincreased \u2018reactivity\u2019 as compared to Le\u00f3n where discharge is directly from the city.\nOther factors\nThe very low reactivity of the DOC at Tha Muang is thought  to  be  due  to  an  entirely  different\nreason, that is the burning of  the  waste,  which  is  carried  out  at  this  site.   The  residual  DOC\nderived from the wastes appears to be lacking in the functional groups which  react  with  chlorine\nor bromine.\nNone of these factors described above account for the  high  rate  of  THM  formation  in  Hat  Yai\nwastewaters. The limited buffering capacity of the sediments and the low pH  of  the  groundwater\n(Gooddy et al, 1997) may be a factor, giving the effect of accelerated ageing.\n4 Correlations between parameters\nSelected interparameter correlations  are  shown  in  Table  5.   Tha  Muang  has  been  considered\nseparately from the other landfill sites due to its different behaviour and has been omitted from the\ncalculations for landfills.  These  show  the  correlation  between  THMFP  and  DOC  to  be  only\nmoderate  overall,  but  greater  at  landfill  sites  (0.87)  than  at  wastewater   sites   (0.82).    This\ncorrelation is much improved for wastewater sites when Dzitya is excluded.\nThe landfills also show  a  correlation  between  SEC  -  DOC  and  also  SEC  -  THMFP  but  the\nwastewater sites do not. For the wastewater sites where  the  linear  regression  of  bromine-related\nparameters  is  dominated  by  the  high  bromide  concentrations  in   Wadi   Dhuleil,   which   are\ncorrelated with SEC.\nNone of the sites shows the expected correlation between THMFP  and  bromide  and  indeed  only  at  Tha\nMuang is there is a positive relation between THMFP and percentage brominated products, although this is\nnot a strong linear relationship.\nHealth risks from chlorination of polluted water\nThe THMs have been shown to have both genotoxic and carcinogenic  effects  particularly  in  the\nliver and kidney. Because the four compounds usually occur together, it has  been  the  practice  to\nconsider these as a group and a number of countries have  set  potable  quality  guidelines  on  this\nbasis. However, the WHO guideline values for water disinfection products are now  set  separately\nat 200 (g l-1 for chloroform,  100  (g  l-1  for  bromoform  and  chlorodibromomethane,  and  60  (g  l-1  for\nbromodichloromethane (WHO, 1993).\nThe WHO estimate an overall GV by combining the individual components as follows:\nwhere C = concentration and GV = guideline value.  Applying this to the highest  of  the  result  from  Mae\nHia, shown in Figure 2, with a high bromine concentration gives the additive toxicity as  1.7,  almost  twice\nthe guideline value.\nA risk assessment has also been calculated for groundwater consumption by  the  local  population\nat Mae Hia using the USEPA approved Risk*Assistant model.  This estimates both  the  toxic  and\ncarcinogenic  risks.   The  toxic  risk  (expressed  as  the  hazard  quotient,  HQ)  is  based  on   the\ncomparison of actual exposure to a substance to a reference dose, as follows:\nHQ  =  total amount ingested\nbody weight ( exposure period ( reference dose\nThe reference dose,  the  dose  which  can  occur  over  a  prolonged  period  without  ill  effect,  is\nextrapolated from toxicological studies of exposure that demonstrate a  critical  effect.   Reference\ndoses are tabulated in the IRIS and HEAST databases maintained  by  the  USEPA.   It  is  general\npractice to assume that a toxic chemical has an effect below which toxic effects do not occur.\nCarcinogenic compounds differ from toxic  compounds  in  that  there  is  no  lower  limit  for  the\nexistence of risk.  Carcinogenic risks are statements of probability; for example  one  in  a  million\n(1:1,000,000) increased risk of cancer.  The risk is calculated by calculating  the  lifetime  average\ndaily dose (LADD) multiplied by a slope factor.   The LADD is calculated as:\n      LADD  =   total amount ingested\nbody weight ( lifetime\nThe slope factor is the gradient of the line of the dose \u2013  response  curve  derived  from  laboratory\ntoxicological studies.  Slope factors are available in the USEPA databases.\nThe difficulty with such risk assessments lies in the calculation  of  the  exposure  factors  used  to\nestimate the dose.  For a typical Thai population the exposure factors shown in Table 6 were used.\n Using these factors suggests that the  disinfection  of  groundwater  contaminated  by  leachate  at\nMae Hia does pose a health risk.  Taking the same result from Mae Hia as an example, the Hazard\nQuotient was 2.77,  i.e.  a  toxic  risk  due  to  chloroform  exists,  and  the  carcinogenic  risk  was\n3:10,000.  The USEPA range of concern is for an increased carcinogenic risk of 1:1,000,000.\nWe stress that great care needs to be taken in the interpretation of these results. The model is  very\nsensitive  to  uncertainty  in  the  parameterisation  of  the  exposure  factors,  especially   exposure\nduration and  ingestion  rates  and  conservative  estimates  were  used  here.   However,  what  the\nmodelling  does  demonstrate  that  there  are  indirect  health  effects  due  to  the  chlorination  of\nleachate contaminated groundwater. Additional risks may be associated with  the  consumption  of\nlocally grown fruit and vegetables.\nConclusions\nThe trihalomethane formation potential is  a  valuable  tool  for  quantifying  non-specific  organic\ncontamination of groundwater by urban wastes, landfill leachate and domestic wastewater.   It  has\nadvantages over measurement of dissolved organic carbon since specialised  sample  preservation,\na very rapid turnaround time or sophisticated  analytical  equipment  are  not  required.   It  is  also\nclosely related to one of the principal risk factors associated  with  enhanced  DOC  concentrations\nin drinking water\nThe reactivity of the dissolved organic carbon in groundwater was  consistently  in  the  range  20-\n38 (g trihalomethanes formed per mg carbon for the sites studied.   The  exceptions  were  at  Tha  Muang,\nThailand,  where  waste  was  burnt  during  disposal  and  in  Wadi  Dhuleil  where  groundwater   bromide\nconcentrations were very high.\nThe  trihalomethane  formation  potential  can  be  used   to   estimate   the   health   risk   to   local\ngroundwater users from the by-products of water chlorination.  This has shown that this  risk  may\nmake groundwater unsafe for drinking and therefore it is recommended that a  regular  monitoring\nprogramme  of  THM  formation  potential  in  chlorinated  water  is   instigated   in   areas   where\ngroundwater has been affected by wastewater.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors are  grateful  to  all  those  who  have  contributed  to  this  work:  in  Thailand,  Vachi\nRamnarong,  Somkid  Buapeng   and   Suchai   Sinpool-Anant   of   the   Department   of   Mineral\nResources, Somjai Karnchanawong of the Department of Environmental  Engineering,  University\nof Chiang Mai, and Proespichaya Kanatharana of Prince of Prince of Songkla University, Hat Yai;\nin Jordan, Raja Gedeon, Ahmed Ulimat and Randa Tuffaha of the Water  Authority  of  Jordan;  in\nMexico, Roger Gonz\u00e1les Herrera, Victor Coronada Pereza and Javier Frias  Tuyin  of  the  Faculty\nof Engineering, Autonomous  University  of  Yucat\u00e1n,  and  Oscar  Escolero,  Laura  Esparza  and\nAraceli Gonz\u00e1lez of the National Water Commission.
