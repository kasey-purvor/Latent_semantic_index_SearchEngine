INTRODUCTION\nFusarium culmorum (W.G.Sm.) Sacc. and Fusarium graminearum Schw. (Giberella zeae\n(Schein.) Petch are the two most important Fusaria responsible for wheat scab in Europe and\nNorth America and responsible for the contamination of cereal grain with trichothecenes,\nespecially deoxynivalenol (DON). This has resulted in legislative limits being set in raw and\nprocessed cereals for human food and animal feed for DON in many countries. Thus\nsignificant effort has gone into development of prevention strategies for minimising\ncontamination of such commodities with DON (Aldred & Magan 2004).\nThe key environmental factors which influence germination, growth and the\nbiosynthesis of DON and other trichothecenes have been demonstrated to include water\navailability and temperature (Magan et al. 2006). Indeed, detailed profiles have been\ndeveloped for the effect of aw, temperature and time on both DON and Nivalenol (NIV)\nproduction by strains of these species (Hope & Magan 2003; Hope et al. 2005). The\nJournal of the Royal Society INTERFACE 8, 117-126 (2011)\n2\nbiochemical and genetic control of the biosynthetic pathways for these trichothecenes have\nbeen studied (Dejardins 2007; Alexander et al. 2009). This suggests that some of the key\nregulatory and transcriptional genes involved in trichothecene biosynthesis includes Tri4 (a\ncytochrome P450 multifunctional monooxygenase which catalyses four steps in the\nconversion of trichodiene to isotrichodermin and trichothecene), TRI5 (trichodiene synthase\nwhich catalyses isomerisation of farnesyl pyrophosphate to form trichodiene), TRI6 (a zinc\nfinger protein which is a transcription factor and positive regulator of the trichothecene\npathway genes), TRI10 (regulates transcription of TRI6), TRI12 (trichothecene efflux pump\nwhich transports the metabolites out of the cell) and TRI13 (a cytochrome P450 oxygenase).\nWhile a significant amount of work has been done on examining the TRI5 gene in relation to\nbiotic and abiotic factors (Dejardins 2007) practically no information is available on the\neffect of environmental stress on these other key genes in F. culmorum and F. graminaerum.\nA systems approach to try and relate the different parameters from a molecular to a\nphenotypic production of the secondary metabolite in relation to environmental factors has\nnot been previously attempted.\nA few studies have examined the influence of some abiotic stress factors in relation\nto the actual biosynthetic genes involved in mycotoxin biosynthesis (Feng & Leonhard 1998;\nGeisen 2004; Llorens et al. 2004; O\u2019Brian et al. 2007; Schmidt-Heydt et al. 2007; Jurado et\nal. 2008; Schmidt-Heydt et al. 2008). These studies have confirmed that environmental\nfactors do have an influence on gene activation and transcription. Complex relationships\noccur between such abiotic environmental factors and mycotoxin biosynthesis at the\ntranscriptional level and that obtained when phenotypic mycotoxin production is quantified.\nThe recent development of a microarray which has sub-arrays for the gene clusters of\nkey mycotoxigenic fungi has provided an excellent tool for examining in more detail the\nimpact that changes in interacting environmental factors may have on relative expression of\nthese gene clusters and relating this to phenotypic mycotoxin production (Schmidt-Heydt\nand Geisen 2007; Gardiner et al. 2009). Thus, the objectives of this study were to (a)\nexamine the effect of aw x temperature interactions on growth, DON production and relative\ngene expression of six key genes (TRI4, TRI5, TRI6, TRI10, TRI12, TRI13) in the TRI gene\ncluster using a mycotoxin gene microarray and (b) attempt to model the relationship between\nthese TRI genes, environmental factors and DON production for represenatative strains of\ntwo species, F. culmorum and F. graminearum.\n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS\n2.1 Fungal strains\nThe strains used were from the culture collection of the Max Rubner-Institute, Karlsruhe,\nGermany. Fusarium culmorum strain BFE928 produces both DON and NIV and a strain of\nF. graminearum BFE1006, was a DON producer. They were both isolated from infected\nwheat grain. These were routinely maintained on a conducive yeast extract sucrose medium\n(YES, 20 g yeast extract l-1, 150 g sucrose l-l, 15 g agar l-1 in water) and incubated at 25oC\nfor seven days before use in experiments.\n2.2 Modification of water activity of media, incubation and growth assessment.\nThe YES medium (0.995 aw) was modified with glycerol\/water solutions to different water\nactivity levels (% w\/v of YES medium: 0.98\/13.1; 0.95\/19.9; 0.93\/24.5). The media were\nprepared in 9 cm Petri plates and allowed to cool. All treatments and replicate agar media\nwere overlayed with sterile cellophane sheets (8.5 cm, P400, Cannings Ltd., Bristol, U.K.)\nbefore inoculation with a 3 mm agar disc from the growing margin of 7 day old cultures of\nJournal of the Royal Society INTERFACE 8, 117-126 (2011)\n3\neach species. This facilitated both growth measurements and removal of the fungal biomass\nfor RNA extractions.\nFor measurement of the diametric mycelial growth rate, the diameter of the colony\nwas measured in two directions at right angles to each other. The temporal increase in colony\nradius was plotted and the linear regression lines for the linear phase were used to obtain the\nrelative growth rates (mm day-1).\nThe plates were incubated at 15, 20, 25 and 30\u00baC for 9 days, and the experiment\nconsisted of a fully replicated set of treatments with 3-4 replicates per treatment. The\nexperiments were carried out twice to confirm results and also to ensure that enough biomass\nwas available for RNA extraction and microarray analyses.\n2.3 Isolation of RNA from samples.\nTo perform microarray and real time PCR experiments RNA was isolated using the\nRNAeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). An amount of 1 g of the mycelium was\nground with a mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen. About 250 mg of the resulting powder\nwas used for isolation of total RNA. The powder was resuspended in 750 \u00b5l lysis buffer,\nmixed with 7.5 \u00b5l \u03b2-mercaptoethanol and 10 glass beads with a diameter of 1 mm (B. Braun\nBiotech International GmbH, Melsungen, Germany) in a 2 ml RNase free micro reaction\ntube. The extracts were mixed thoroughly and incubated for 15 min at 55 \u00b0C and 42 kHz in a\nS10H ultrasonic bath (Elma, Singen, Germany). All further procedures were essentially the\nsame as suggested by the manufacturer of the kit.\ncDNA synthesis. For cDNA synthesis 12 \u00b5l of the DNase I treated total RNA were\nused along with the Omniscript Reverse Transcription kit (Qiagen). The reaction mixture\nwas essentially as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and incubated\nat 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. The cDNA was stored at \u201320 \u00b0C.\nMicroarray experiments.The microarray used in this study has the mycotoxin genes\nfor a number of fungi and includes two sub-arrays with the TRI genes for Gibberella zeae\nand F. sporotrichoides. This has been recently described in detail by Schmidt-Heydt and\nGeisen (2007). For labelling of cDNA an amount of 10 - 50 \u00b5g of the DNase I treated total\nRNA was used according to the specifications of the manufacturer of the Micromax cDNA\nDirect Labeling kit (Perkin Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences, Inc. Boston, USA). After\ncDNA synthesis and labelling, the cDNA was purified with a QiaQuick MinElute-97 Kit\n(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The labelled and purified cDNA was brought to dryness in a\nSpeed Vac concentrator (Savant Instruments, Farmingdale, USA), suspended in 60 \u00b5l\nhybridization buffer (Scienion, Berlin, Germany), heated for 2 min. at 95 \u00b0C and hybridized\nfor 18 h at 42\u00b0C to the microarray by using an automatic hybridization station (Perkin\nElmer). After hybridization the array was scanned with a confocal laser scanner system\n(Scanarray lite, Perkin Elmer) at a resolution of 5 \u00b5m. The analysis of the results was\nperformed using the Scanarray software (Perkin Elmer, Boston, USA). The results were\nnormalized using the Lowess algorithm (locally weighted scatter plot smoothing) and the\nsubtraction of the background signal intensity. As control, the constitutively expressed\n\u03b2-tubulin gene was used.\n2.4 Quantitative determination of deoxynivalenol (DON) by HPLC.\nMycotoxin extraction and analyses was performed using a modified method of Cooney et al.\n(2001). Each sample (10 g) was homogenised and mixed well. The sample was extracted by\nmixing with acetonitrile\/methanol (14:1; 40 ml) shaken for 2 h and then filtered through\nWhatman No. 1 (Whatman International Ltd, Maidstone, U.K.) filter paper. For analysis a 2-\nJournal of the Royal Society INTERFACE 8, 117-126 (2011)\n4\nml aliquot was passed through a cleanup cartridge consisting of a 2-ml syringe (Fisher Ltd,\n3Loughborough) packed with a disc of Whatman filter paper No. 1;, a 5-ml luger of glass\nwool and 300 mg of alumina\/activated carbon (20:1, 500 mg). The column was washed with\nacetonitrile\/methanol\/water (80:5:15; 500 ml), and the combined eluate was evaporated\n(compressed air, 50oC) to dryness and then resuspended in methanol\/water (5:95; 500 \u00b5l).\nQuantification of DON was performed using a Luna C18 reversed phase column\n(100 x 4.6 mm; 5 \u00b5m particle size; Phenomenex, Macclesfield, UK) connected to a guard\ncolumn SecurityGuard (4 x 3 mm) filled with the same stationary phase. Separation was\nachieved using an isocratic mobile phase of methanol\/water (12:88, v\/v) at a flow rate of 1.5\nml min-1). Eluates (injection volume of 50 \u03bcl) were detected using a UV detector (Gilson\n117, Anachem, Luton, U.K.) set at 220 nm with an attenuation of 0.01 AUFS. The retention\ntime for DON was 13.3 min. Quantification was relative to external standards of 1 to 8 \u03bcg\nml-1) in methanol\/water (5:95). The quantification limit was 5 ng g-1.\n2.5 Multiple regression analyses and statistical analyses.\nThe analysis was performed using a multiple regression analysis for the expression of six\nkey TRI genes which are involved in the trichothecene biosynthetic pathway (TRI6, TRI10,\nTRI4, TRI5, TRI12 and TRI13), temperature and aw conditions with DON concentration\nconsidered as the selected dependent variable. The microarray expression data for each gene\nwere used to obtain a normalised relative expression value by dividing the actual copy\nnumber by the maximum recorded expression values for a particular gene (e.g. normalised\nTRI4 expression = actual TRI4\/maximum TRI4 over all conditions).\nThese were used to examine the relationship between several independent or\npredictor variables and the dependent variable, in this case, DON concentration. The analysis\nwhich was applied to predict DON concentration based on the independent factors was a\ngood tool to obtain vectors showing the significance of each factor on the independent\nvariables. The model was used to predict the dependent Y-variable or response as a function\nof n > 1 independent of X-variables or predictors. STATISTICA software (version 6.0,\nStatSoft Inc., Tulsa, USA) was used for response surface regression of the data obtained. The\nstatistical analysis of the model was performed in the form of an analysis of variance\n(ANOVA). This analysis included the Fisher\u2019s test (overall model significance), its\nassociated probability P(F), correlation coefficient R, and determination of the R2 coefficient\nmeasure the goodness of fit of the regression model. It also included the t-value for the\nestimated coefficients and associated probabilities. Non-linear models were examined but\nthey did not provide a good fit to the data. The use of less parametres, e.g. 2-5 gene\nexpression data were also evaluated and gave a worse fit.\n3. RESULTS\n3.1 Effect of water activity and temperature on growth\nFigure 1 shows the effect of aw on relative growth rates of F. culmorum (BFE928) and F.\ngraminearum (BFE1006) strains on a conducive YES medium modified with the non-ionic\nsolute glycerol. Overall, the highest growh was observed at 30oC and 0.98 aw for F.\nculmorum and 0.995 for F. graminearum. Similar growth was observed at 0.995 aw, but only\nfor F. culmorum at 25oC. A significantly slower growth was observed at 15oC for both strain\nover the aw spectrum tested. At 30oC the optimum aw was 0.98, while at all other\ntemperatures for both species this occurred when water was freely available (0.995 aw). The\nlimits for growth varied with temperature, but were between 0.93-0.95 aw. For both strains\nJournal of the Royal Society INTERFACE 8, 117-126 (2011)\n5\nsome growth was observed at 0.93 aw and temperatures >15oC, but not at 0.90 aw over the\nexperimental period.\n3.2 Phenotypic deoxynivalenol production and environmental factors\nThe effect of aw x temperature conditions on DON production showed that there were\ndifferences between the two strains over the 9 day time scale (Figure 2). F. culmorum\nproduced no DON at 15oC during this period but overall this strain produced significantly\nmore than the F. graminearum strain used. For the latter species, although less DON was\nproduced, the toxin was produced at 15oC and 0.995 aw. Optimum DON production was at\n20 and 25oC for F. culmorum and F. graminearum respectively. This was different from that\nfor growth.\n3.3 TRI gene expression in relation to environmental factors\nFigure 3 summarises the relative expression of the six genes (TRI4, TRI5, TRI6, TRI10,\nTRI12 and TRI13) under the different environmental treatments used. This shows that there\nwere different patterns of gene expression depending on abiotic conditions and species.\nFurthermore, the expression data for the strain of F. culmorum were relatively much higher\nthan for the F. graminearum one reflecting the lower DON levels produced by the latter\nstrain. The TRI5 gene, a key one in the biosynthetic pathway of trichothecenes, was\nexpressed over all the conditions examined. The expression data for all six key genes (TRI4,\nTRI5, TRI6, TRI10, TRI12, TRI13) were used for modelling the impact of environmental\ninteractions on phenotypic DON production.\n3.4 Modelling of the relationship between gene expression and DON production\n(i) F. culmorum strain: In order to find the statistically significant interactions between\nfactors, a model based on a polynomial equation fitting the experimental data for DON\nproduction in relation to the expression of the 6 TRI genes and the environmental parameters\nwas developed. The determination co-efficient (R2) was 0.9709. The regressed model is\npresented below:\n13Tri12Tri5Tri4Tri\n10Tri6TriC)T(a\n-1\n6.42X10.8X-X01.23.16X\nX03.4X5.21.1.216X085.5)ggDON( o\nw\n\uf02d\uf02b\n\uf02b\uf02d\uf02d\uf02b\uf03d X\uf06d\nEq. 1\nWhere X = coded factor and the subscript name the factor in each term of the model. For the\ngene expression a standardised value was used defined as\nvalueMaximum\nvalueActual\nX gen _\n_\uf03d\ntherefore the gene expression will be in the range of 0<X<1. The coded values for\ntemperature and water activiy are the coded levels tested from the lowest (1) to the higest (4)\nvalues.\n(ii) F. graminearum strain: The gene expression data for this species was also used for\ndevelopment of a model based on a polynomial equation which fitted the experimental data\nfor DON production by F. graminearum. This had a multiple correlation coefficient (R2) of\n0.9542 . The regressed model is presented below:\n13Tri12Tri5Tri4Tri\n10Tri6TriC)T(a\n-1\n8.22X-2.35X-11.0X11.28X\n7.8X0.283X1.054X1.262X-5.16)ggDON( o\nw\n\uf02b\uf02b\n\uf02d\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf03d\uf06d\nEq. 2\nJournal of the Royal Society INTERFACE 8, 117-126 (2011)\n6\nUsing these models the observed versus predicted DON concentration in relation to\nthe expression of the 6 genes and aw and temperature are shown in Figures 4a and b. This\nFigure suggests that while there is some under and over prediction the model does generally\nfit the experimental data, especially with the F. culmorum strain.\nTable 1 shows the overall statistical fit of the model and the significance of the\nfactors (TRI genes, aw, temperature) in relation to DON production for the F. culmorum\nstrain. This Table shows that DON production was statistically related to the experession of\na number of TRI genes (e.g. TRI5, TRI12, TRI13). For the F. graminearum strain there\nappeared to be a much more co-ordinated expression of these TRI genes with both aw and\ntemperature, and expression of TRI4, TRI5, TRI10 and TRI13 all being statistically\nsignificant factors (Table 2a, b).\nFigure 5 shows examples of two dimensional contour plots relating specific gene\nexpression and aw levels for both species to predicted DON production for TRI5, TRI6 and\nTRI13 as examples using the developed models. This shows clearly that under both aw\noptimum and minima there is an increased expression of these genes and this can be related\ndirectly to predicted DON production levels. This shows that environmental stress can result\nin increased gene expression which in turn relates to phenotypic secondary metabolite\nproduction. For the F. culmorum strain (Figure 5, a, b, c) this is clear while for the F.\ngraminearum one (Figure 5 d, e, f) less so, although there is a pattern for conditions\nconducive and non-conducive to DON production. The lower DON production by the strain\nof F. graminearum used in our experiments is reflected in the relationship between the\nexpression of these three genes used as examples and the predicted DON production. Similar\npatterns were obtained with regard to the other TRI genes and for temperature (data not\nshown).\nFigure 6 shows the predicted contour maps for relative DON production based on\nthe available data and the model in relation to the key environmental factors of temperature\nand aw. For both strains optimum was at 20-25oC and >0.98 aw.\n4. DISCUSSION\nThis study is one of the first to attempt to relate phenotypic mycotoxin production to key TRI\ncluster gene expression in relation to a matrix of interacting environmental factors for strains\nof mycotoxigenic fungi. The growth of both strains was shown to be optimum at 30oC and\nbetween 0.98-0.995 aw. However, DON production was optimum at 20-25oC over the 9 day\nexperimental period. This is consistent with some of the previous studies relating aw x\ntemperature effects to growth and DON production for F. culmorum amd F. graminearum\nstrains from Europe and Argentina (Hope & Magan 2003; Hope et al. 2005; Ramirez et al.\n2006). Marin et al. (2004) showed that the temperature x aw profiles for germination, growth\nand phenotypic fumonisin production by strains of F. verticillioides and F. proliferatum\nwere also different. Similarly, for mycotoxigenic fungi such as Aspergillus carbonarius and\nochratoxin A production differences were observed with optimum growth at 30-35oC and\n0.98 aw while toxin production was optimum at 15-20oC and 0.98-0.95 aw (Belli et al. 2004;\nMitchell et al. 2004). However, none of these previous studies attempted to relate specific\nexpression profiles of key genes involved in the biosynthesis of the toxins to growth or\nphenotypic mycotoxin production. The only studies of this type were those recently reported\nfor the effects of osmotic and matric potential on the kinetics of FUM1 gene expression by\nF. verticillioides (Jurado et al. 2008), on otapksPV expression by Penicillium verrucosum in\nrelation to suboptimal preservatives and environmental factors (Schmidt-Heydt et al. 2007)\nand the recent study which showed the effect of aw x temperature conditions on mycotoxin\nJournal of the Royal Society INTERFACE 8, 117-126 (2011)\n7\ngene cluster activities for P. nordicum, F. culmorum and A. parasiticus using the microarray\nused in the present study (Schmidt-Heydt et al. 2008).\nThis study has shown that some of the key genes in the biosynthetic pathway for\ntrichothecene production (TRI4, TRI5, TRI6, TRI10, TRI12 and TRI13) are markedly\nincreased and influenced by interacting environmental conditions of temperature x aw. The\nincreased activity of the TRI5 (sesquiterpene cyclase) and TRI4 (cytochrome P450) is\nparticularly important as they are key genes involved in the initial biosynthetic pathway for\ntrichodiene synthase and trichodiene oxygenase. Other important genes downstream from\nthese are those involved in regulation and transport (e.g. TRI6 transcription factor; TRI12,\nsuperfamily transporter; TRI10 regulatory gene) in both species (Desjardins 2007). Indeed,\nstudies by Peplow et al. (2003) showed that the TRI10 is a regulatory gene for four\ntrichothecene pathway-specific genes in F. sporotrichioides. This may also be relevant to the\nF. culmorum strain used in our study as it also produces nivalenol.\nIn the present study we have only focussed on these 6 genes although the data for all\nthe TRI genes were obtained using the microarray (data not shown). However, there are\ncomplex interactions between gene expression and phenotypic mycotoxin production when\none considers the whole cluster of genes involved. A lack of correlation between relative\ngene expression and toxin production for some genes has been observed previously. For\nexample, this has been found with the relationship for some genes involved in aflatoxin\nproduction (Scherm et al. 2005). They showed that expression of only a small number of\naflatoxin biosynthetic pathway genes were directly coupled with aflatoxin biosynthesis. This\ncomplexity was recently demonstrated in work with a mycotoxin microarray (Schmidt-Heydt\net al. 2009) which showed that there are two clusters of genes which were expressed in\nclusters and this was influenced by water availability. However, in the studies by Scherm et\nal. (2005) the effect of environmental factors was not considered.\nThe polynomial models were useful tools to try and unravel the complex correlations\nbetween these specific genes in the cluster and the range of interacting environmental\nparameters studied. The analysis showed that models can be developed to relate gene\nexpression to secondary metabolite production and subsequently used to successfully predict\nDON production. Moreover, the models show that there may well be strain and perhaps\nspecies differences in terms of the patterns of expression of these 6 genes in relation to\ninteracting environmental factors and phenotypic mycotoxin production. This would confirm\nthe differences previously found for both temporal growth and DON production by strains of\nF. culmorum and F. graminearum (Hope et al. 2004). The next step will be to try and\nvalidate this model by using RT-PCR data for these specific genes and relate their expression\nto the predicted DON production we have observed in this study and then use other data sets\nto test the model.\nBecause of the nature of this type of study samples were taken after a specific time of\n9 days as initial experiments suggested that this was the optimum for TRI5 gene expression\nat 0.98 aw. However, it may well be that as environmental stress is imposed there is a longer\nlag time before exponential growth occurs. Thus a wider time frame might need to be\nincluded for more detailed kinetic studies. Indeed, work with the FUM1 gene expression by\nF. verticillioides suggests that under ionic water stress there was a decrease in growth but a\nsignificant increase in gene expression as aw was reduced to 0.95 and 0.93 aw over a 15 day\nperiod (Jurado et al. 2008).\nWe believe that a systems approach by integrating related molecular, ecological and\nsecondary metabolite data can be a powerful tool for more targeted functional studies on the\nrelationship between gene expression and phenotypic mycotoxin production in relation to\ninteracting environmental conditions. Furthermore, it may enable more rapid studies to be\ncarried out in identifying anti-fungal compounds which may inhibit specific key biosynthetic\nJournal of the Royal Society INTERFACE 8, 117-126 (2011)\n8\nand regulatory genes in these clusters which can be used for the development of improved\nprevention strategies to minimise mycotoxins in the food chain.\nAcknowledgements: We are grateful to Mrs. E.S.
