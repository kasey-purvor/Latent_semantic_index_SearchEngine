Two key requirements for the active materials within these systems are the ability provide\nsufficiently high\/large activation forces\/displacements and the ability to integrate the material with the underlying\nsupport structure[4,5].\nLead zirconate titanate (PZT) is a favoured active material due to its high piezoelectric coefficients[6]. However, it is\ntypically processed at temperatures above 1200\u00baC making it unsuitable for direct integration with silicon based MEMS\ndevices[2]. Separate processing of PZT and subsequent grinding, polishing and bonding can be used to achieve an\nintegrated system but the large wastage, long processing times, and non-integrated processing may make this approach\nunattractive. Alternative approaches used to integrate the production of the PZT thick film with the silicon processing\ninclude screen printing[7], electrophoresis[8] and sol gel techniques[9]. Screen printing and electrophoresis require\nrelatively high temperatures for processing (>850\u00baC) while sol gel techniques are often limited to thicknesses below 10\n\u00b5m due to the increased risk of cracking[10] and the excessive time required to achieve thicker films[2].\nBarrow[11] adapted the sol gel method by mixing the sol with a PZT powder which allowed much thicker PZT films to be\ndeposited at low temperatures. This process was later modified by others who incorporated a low temperature sintering\naid[12] and intermediate sol infiltration\/pyrolysis steps[13] to produce high density PZT thick films.\nThe resultant films exhibit relative permittivities comparable to those of bulk ceramics. However the piezoelectric\ncoefficients recorded are typically much lower than those observed for bulk ceramic. This work aims to examine the\ndielectric, piezoelectric and polarisation behaviour of a series of these thick films to determine how the microstructure\nand the presence of the rigid substrate may affect the properties of the films. To this end, a series of samples with varying\nlevels of porosity have been made and their microstructure and dielectric\/piezoelectric properties assessed.\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE\nFilm preparation\nA sol, designed to yield a hard doped PZT when pyrolysed, was produced using lead acetate, zirconium isopropoxide and\ntitanium isopropoxide as precursors. 2-methoxyethanol was selected as the solvent due to its low viscosity and high\nsurface tension. A full description of the sol synthesis process is given in a previous article[12]. The PZT producing sol\nwas then mixed with PZT powder of comparable composition (PZ26 Ferroperm), a liquid phase sintering aid (0.8PbO-\n0.2Cu2O), and a dispersant (KR55, Kenrich Petrochemicals). The final compositional ratio of the composite slurry was\n1.5 g PZT powder : 1 ml sol : 4.7 wt% (relative to PZT powder) sintering aid : 2 wt% (relative to PZT powder)\ndispersant. Before use, the composite slurry was ball milled for 24 hours to ensure thorough dispersion of the\nconstituents.\nThe composite films were produced by spin coating the composite slurry onto a Ti\/Pt coated silicon wafer at 2000 rpm\nfor 30 seconds. Following spinning the films were dried at 200 \u00baC for 60 seconds and pyrolysed for 15 seconds at 450 \u00baC.\nThe final film thickness was increased by depositing further layers in an identical manner.\nR.A. Dorey & R.W. Whatmore\nFilms of higher density were produced by repeated sol infiltration and pyrolysis of each porous composite layer before\nthe next composite layer was deposited. Each composite\/sol infiltration was dried and pyrolysed before the next\ndeposition stage. The resultant films were described using the nomenclature (C+2S)4 which describes a 4 layer film\nwhere each layer is composed of a composite layer infiltrated with 2 sol treatments. Once the required film thickness had\nbeen obtained the film was subjected to a rapid thermal annealing treatment at 710 \u00baC for 30 minutes.\nFilm characterisation\nStructural and crystallographic analysis of the films were conducted using X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Siemens D-5005)\nand scanning electron microscopy (ABT-55) of fracture and polished cross-sections. 1 and 2 mm diameter gold\/chrome\nelectrodes were evaporated onto the surfaces of the films to allow their electrical properties to be assessed. Relative\npermittivity and dielectric loss were assessed at 1 kHz (Wayne Kerr Precision Component Analyser 6425B). Prior to\npiezoelectric measurements the films were poled at 130 \u00baC for 5 minutes using a field of 8 V\/\u00b5m. The piezoelectric\ncoefficients d33, f and e31, f were measured using flexural method[1] with a modified Berlincourt-type piezometer (Take\nControl PM25).\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nMicrostructure & Crystallography\nFigure 1 shows scanning electron microscope (SEM) photomicrographs of fracture surface cross-section of films with 0,\n2 and 4 sol infiltration\/pyrolysis steps.\nFigure 1 \u2013 SEM photomicrographs of fracture surfaces of films with different levels of sol infiltration\/pyrolysis\nIt can be seen that when low levels of intermediate sol infiltration are employed the resultant films exhibit a density\ngradient with the highest density regions present at the PZT\/wafer boundary. This is caused by the infiltration of sol from\nthe composite slurry into underlying porous layers as each new composite layer is deposited. By infiltrating each\ncomposite layer before the next is deposited the pores are filled and a homogenous microstructure is obtained. An added\nadvantage of this approach is that the surface quality of the films is greatly improved as each composite layer is\ndeposited onto a smooth surface. When no infiltration is used the surface finish of each successive composite layer is\nprogressively degraded due to the worsening surface finish of the previous layer.\nXRD results (figure 2) show the film to be fully perovskite with no evidence of the presence of pyrochlore phases.\nFigure 2 \u2013 XRD pattern for a (C+4S)4 film on silicon showing full perovskite phase development\nDielectric properties\nResults relating to relative permittivity are presented in figure 3. The relative permittivity can be seen to increase with\nincreasing sol infiltration steps due to the reduction in the level of porosity. The value of relative permittivity obtained\nfor the (C+4S)4 film is close to that measured for unpoled bulk PZ26 (1050). The dielectric loss was found to be\nindependent (~2%) of the number of intermediate sol infiltrations.\nApparent reduction in the value of the d33\nFigure 3 \u2013 Relative permittivity of the composite films as a function of intermediate sol infiltration steps\nPiezoelectric properties\nThe variation in d33, f and e31, f as functions of sol infiltration are presented in figures 4 and 5. It can be seen that d33, f is\ninitially lower when no infiltration steps are employed. If sol infiltration is used the d33, f piezoelectric coefficient\nincreased to a plateau value of approximately 60 pC\/N.\nFigure 4 \u2013 d33, f of the composite films as a function of intermediate sol infiltration steps\nFigure 5 \u2013 e31, f of the composite films as a function of intermediate sol infiltration steps\nThe initially low value of d33, f is thought to be due to the very high levels of porosity present in the films made with no\nsol infiltration steps. It is proposed that the structure is such that the application of the measurement stress would cause\nthe PZT film to deform in such a way as to cause bending and shearing of the bridges between particles which may\nreduce the net charge produced due to the generation of d31 and d51 charges and\/or the reduction in d33 generated charges.\nWith the application of sol infiltration steps during processing a more rigid structure is obtained where such deformation\ndoes not occur. The d33, f plateau value of approximately 60 pC\/N is significantly below the value of d33 quoted for bulk\nPZ26 (330 pC\/N). However, it should be noted that the d33 piezoelectric coefficient is reduced by the presence of a rigid\nsubstrate[14, 15] (equation 1). Conversely the e31 piezoelectric coefficient is increased in magnitude by clamping[16]\n(equation 2). This occurs because d33, d31 and e33 containing terms are positive while the e31 term is negative.\nR.A. Dorey & R.W. Whatmore\nEE\nE\nf SS\nS\nddd\n1211\n13\n3133,33 2 \uf02d\n\uf02d\uf03d Equation 1\nE\nE\nf C\nC\neee\n33\n13\n3331,31 \uf02d\uf03d Equation 2\nIf values for the bulk properties of a hard doped PZT comparable to PZ26[17] are substituted into equations 1 and 2 the\nd33, f and e31, f piezoelectric coefficient would be expected to be approximately 130 pC\/N and -16 C\/m2 respectively. Both\nof these predicted values are greater in magnitude to those observed for the high density thick films.\nOne of the underlying assumptions that must be considered when using equations 1 and 2 is that the PZT is considered to\nbe fully poled when bonded to the rigid substrate. However, the composite films are initially unpoled and must therefore\nbe poled while bonded to the rigid substrate. Trolier-McKinstry[18] et al. and Kholkin[19] showed that domain mobility is\nreduced in poled piezoelectric materials when they are constrained by a rigid substrate. It is hypothesised here that the\npresence of the rigid substrate would also reduce domain wall mobility during poling and would therefore have a further\ndeleterious effect on the observed value of d33, f by reducing the degree of poling attainable. To test this hypothesis, an\nXRD analysis was conducted on bulk PZT and the composite films before and after poling.\nLi et al.[20] showed that the relative intensities of the (200) and (002) diffraction peaks of the tetragonal phase changed\nduring poling such that the (002) diffraction planes were favoured. Figure 6 shows the XRD diffraction pattern for bulk\nPZ26, the composite film and a PZT compact containing 4.7 wt% sintering aid, infiltrated with sol and sintered at 710 \u00baC\n(nominally identical composition and thermal processing to that of composite films).\nThe diffraction peaks for the bulk PZT are narrower than those of the compact infiltrated with sol indicating that the\ngrain size of the PZ26 compact is much larger than that of the infiltrated compact. This was confirmed by observations of\nthe microstructures of the two bodies.\nThe XRD peaks for the composite film are wider, and shifted to higher angles, when compared to the peaks for the\ninfiltrated compact. It is unlikely that this extra broadening is due to the a difference in the grain size between the\ncomposite film and the infiltrated compact as the sintering regimes used for the two sample types were nominally\nidentical. The shift in position of the peaks is due to a change in the lattice spacing of the diffraction planes while the\nextra broadening is caused because this change in spacing is not uniform throughout the sample indicative of non-\nuniform stress. Due to the high X-ray attenuation within lead based materials the XRD analysis only obtains information\nabout the near surface material. A non-uniform stress within this region could arise due to local stress release in the\nvicinity of cracks.\nFigure 6 \u2013 XRD pattern of the (200)\/(002) region for poled and unpoled bulk PZ26, compact infiltrated with sol and\nsintered at 710\u00baC and composite film.\nThe shift of the mean peak position to higher diffraction angles (\uf071) is indicative of a reduction in the spacing of the\ndiffraction planes. This change could be caused by an increase in the spacing of the atomic planes perpendicular to the\ndiffraction plane. The action of tensile stresses within the plane of the film (perpendicular to the diffraction plane) would\nbe expected to cause such changes. These tensile stresses would be generated by sintering shrinkage and thermal\nexpansion mismatch between the PZT and the silicon substrate. Analysis of the curvature of the silicon wafer with a 10\n\u00b5m PZT film showed the wafers to be bowed with the PZT film on the inside radius of curvature. This is concurrent with\nthe PZT film being subjected to a tensile stress of approximately 120 MPa.\nThe deformation of the unit cells (and subsequently the domains) is unlikely to result in a net polarisation as stress is\nassumed to act uniformly within the plane of the film and hence any local domain polarisation should be cancelled by the\nrandom orientations of the domains within the plane of the film.\nFollowing poling, the XRD patterns of both the bulk PZ26 sample and the infiltrated compact show the (200)\/(002) peak\nto be shifted to lower diffraction angles indicating an increase in the spacing of the diffraction planes as would be\nexpected from the orientation of the domains. A similar, but much larger magnitude, change in diffraction angle (and\nhence d spacing) was observed for the composite thick film. However, there is still a significant diffraction signal present\nApparent reduction in the value of the d33\nat high diffraction angles indicating that the composite film has not been completely poled. Hysteresis loops obtained\nfrom the composite films show that polarisation similar to bulk PZ26 can be achieved but much higher (~ x 10) fields are\nrequired (figure 7).\nFigure 7 \u2013 Comparison of degree of polarisation bulk PZ26 and composite films\nThe results of the XRD analysis suggest that despite high levels of polarisation during poling, the presence of the tensile\nstress causes a significant proportion of the domains to reorientate once the poling voltage is removed. Similar depoling\nbehaviour has been observed in PZT[21] and BaTiO3[22] subjected to compressive stresses parallel to the poling direction.\nThe action of a compressive stress parallel to the poling direction would be expected to have a similar effect to that of a\ntensile stress perpendicular to the poling direction as the same type of crystallographic deformation would be expected to\noccur.\nThe in-plane tensile stresses will be further increased by domain\/grain shape changes during the poling process.\nCONCLUSIONS\nPZT composite films with a range of densities have been deposited onto silicon wafers at 710 \u00baC. The resulting films\nexhibit values of relative permittivity approximately 80% of those of bulk PZT of comparable composition.\nThe piezoelectric coefficients d33, f and e31, f were found to be approximatly 60 pC\/N and -4.5 C\/m2 respectively. These\nvalues are below those predicted for bulk ceramics bonded to rigid substrates (130 pC\/N and -16 C\/m2). This discrepancy\nwas attributed to the need to pole the thick films while bonded to the rigid substrate.\nThe change in position and width of the (200)\/(002) diffraction peak for bulk PZT indicated that poling increased the\nspacing of the diffraction planes perpendicular to the poling direction.\nAnalysis of the (200)\/(002) diffraction peaks for the composite film PZT and wafer bowing studies showed the film to be\nsubject to tensile stresses. These tensile stresses oppose the poling induced orientation of domains. The accompanying\nshape change during poling will result in further increases in the magnitude of the tensile stress.\nThe presence of the rigid substrate, and the subsequent tensile stresses generated by sintering, thermal expansion\nmismatch and poling, limits the maximum level of retained polarisation. Alternative processing conditions may reduce\nthe stresses generated by sintering. The stresses generated by thermal expansion mismatch and poling can not be altered\nand will affect all silicon-PZT thick film based technologies including those based on bonding bulk unpoled PZT to\nsilicon substrates.\nFinally, it should be noted that the d33 piezoelectric coefficients measured on thick films will always be lower that those\nquoted for bulk materials due to the clamping constraints. Hence, care should be taken when applying these values to\nfigure-of-merit calculations and modelling.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the European Commission and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research\nCouncil under grant GR\/N05970 for their financial support during this project.\nREFERENCES\n[1] J.E.A.
