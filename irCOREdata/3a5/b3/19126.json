INTRODUCTION\nThe mythology of the American West is shaped by liquor\nand Hollywood (Brown 1995). Inspired at least by the\nlatter, the Nobel laureate Niels Bohr considered why,\nduring a gunfight, the man who drew first was the one\nto get shot. He suggested that the intentional act of draw-\ning and shooting is slower to execute than the reactive\naction in response (Cline 1987), an idea grounded in\nthe everyday trade-off between stimulus-driven behaviour\nand intentional, planned actions.\nThis distinction between different classes of action is\nnot merely semantic: evidence for differential neural\nbases for intentional, as opposed to reactive, movements\nis provided by neurophysiology (Kurata & Tanji 1985;\nRomo & Schultz 1987; Mushiake et al. 1991; Maimon &\nAssad 2006), neurology (Laplane et al. 1977; Halsband\net al. 1993; Cunnington et al. 1995; Sumner et al.\n2007) and functional brain imaging (Deiber et al. 1999;\nJenkins et al. 2000; Cunnington et al. 2002). Further,\nbehavioural evidence points to a distinction between\ndifferent types of movement (Waszak et al. 2005), and\nswitching between these two modes of operation can\nresult in a cost (Obhi & Haggard 2004). However, here\nwe test whether there are benefits associated with reactive\nmovements, consistent with Bohr\u2019s intuition and\nthe gunslingers legend.\nTo effect \u2018laboratory gunfights\u2019, we devised a relatively\nsimple task of button pressing that required a stereotyped,r for correspondence (a.e.welchman@bham.ac.uk).\nic supplementary material is available at http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.\nb.2009.2123 or via http:\/\/rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org.\n20 November 2009\n14 January 2010 1multi-segment movement. In particular, naive participants\nmade a speeded sequence of three button presses that\nrequired a lateral movement of their hands (figure 1a).\nThe movement direction and sequence of button presses\nwas the same on every trial. Having become familiar with\nthis task, participants were paired with an opponent and\nplaced in competition (figure 1b). Opponents faced\neach other with their own set of buttons before them and\nheld down the central button (button 1, \u2018the home key\u2019)\nto start a trial. They were instructed that by executing\nthe movement and returning to their home key before\ntheir opponent, they would score points from their\nadversary.\nTo distinguish \u2018initiated\u2019 from \u2018reactive\u2019 movements,\nwe had to ensure that trials had no overt \u2018go\u2019 signal; other-\nwise, all subsequent movements could putatively be\n\u2018reactive\u2019. Therefore, participants were forced to wait a\nvariable, non-signalled delay before initiating the move-\nment. If participants released the home key too early, a\ntone sounded and the trial was aborted. The covert and\nrandom nature of the start delay, and competition\nbetween opponents, meant that each individual produced\nsome trials on which they initiated the movement\nsequence (\u2018initiated\u2019 movements) and other trials on\nwhich they reacted to their opponent (\u2018reactive\u2019\nmovements). Data analysis considered within-subject\ndifferences in movement execution times. That is, we\ncompared the response of each individual under initiative\nand reactive movement conditions, rather than consider-\ning the relative performance of different participants\nand\/or the outcome of interpersonal competitions. We\nreport results from three experiments. The first estab-\nlishes the effect; the second tests whether fasterThis journal is q 2010 The Royal Society\nbutton 3\nbutton 2\nbutton 2 press\nbutton 1\npl\nay\ner\n 2\nstart\nstart\nreaction time\nreaction time\ntime (ms)\ninitiate\nreact\nreaction time\ninitiate\nreact\npa\nrti\nci\npa\nnt\n S\npa\nrti\nci\npa\nnt\n K\nplayer 1\nplayer 2\nexecution\ntime\n213\n0\n0\n(a) (b)\n(c)\n200 400 600 800\n0 200\ntime from movement onset (ms)\n400 600 800\n300 600\nend\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\nend\nbutton 3\nbutton 3 press\nbutton 2\nbutton 1\nbutton 1 press\nlift off\nbutton 1\npl\nay\ner\n 1\nFigure 1. (a) An illustration of the button press sequence. Button 1 was referred to as the \u2018home key\u2019 and participants initiated a\ntrial by keeping this button depressed with their right hand. They then moved to the right to hit button 2, then all the way to the\nleft to hit button 3, before returning to button 1. Buttons were separated laterally by 35 cm (experiment 1) or 15 cm (exper-\niments 2, 3), meaning that arm movement was necessary. (b) An illustration of a single trial competition between two\nparticipants. Players had their own set of three buttons. The movement sequence starts by one player lifting their hand off\nbutton 1, and ends by pressing button 1 again having meanwhile pressed buttons 2 and 3. In this trial player 1 was the initiator\nand player 2 the reactor: player 1\u2019s button 1 is lifted up before player 2\u2019s. Player 1 completes the movement sequence first but\nplayer 2 executes the movement faster. Note that this difference in execution times could be spurious: player 2 might simply\nmake faster movements. Thus, we compared movement times from the same participant\u2014contrasting trials when they were the\ninitiator with those in which they were the reactor. (c) Distributions of button press times for two representative participants.\nBoxplots depict the median, interquartile range and the extreme values; outliers are shown as single points; notches show 95%\nCI for the median. The blue boxplots show the distribution of reaction times on \u2018reactive\u2019 trials. The green, orange and red\nboxplots show the times at which participants depressed buttons 2, 3 and 1, respectively. Separate series are used for reactive\nand initiative trials. All times are relative to releasing button 1. As expected for time data, distributions are positively skewed\n(Ratcliff 1993). The increasingly broad distributions for buttons 3 and 1 are expected as time is relative to button 1 being\nreleased, so variation is compounded at each subsequent stage.\n2 A. E. Welchman et al.

MATERIAL AND METHODS\n(a) Participants\nParticipants were able-bodied, naive individuals (aged 18\u201339)\nrecruited from subject pools in Tu\u00a8bingen and Birmingham.\nTen participants (four males, six females) were used for\nexperiment 1, 10 participants for experiment 2 (six males,\nfour females), and 14 for experiment 3 (one male, 13 females).\nFurther, groups of eight (six males, two females) and 12\n(seven males, five females) participants were used in additionalProc. R. Soc. Bexperiments. All gave written informed consent and local\nethics committees approved the experiments.\n(b) Equipment\nThe equipment consisted of two sets of three buttons inter-\nfaced with a PC through a data acquisition card\n(experiment 1) or the parallel port (experiments 2, 3).\nEach participant had a set of buttons attached to the table\non which they sat. The buttons were capacitor-based\nswitches encased in a rigid plastic of 4.5 cm diameter\n(Captronic Electronic GmbH), i.e. there were no moving\nparts and the buttons did not physically change when\ntouched. Custom-built electronics converted the button\noutput to a standard 5 V pulse. Button presses were detected\nReaction beats intention A. E. Welchman et al. 3\n on July 20, 2010rspb.royalsocietypublishing.orgDownloaded from reliably (s, 1.2 ms) with negligible lag. The centre-to-\ncentre spacing of the buttons was 35 cm (experiment 1) or\n15 cm (experiments 2, 3). Participants sat at either end of\na 140 cm long table. Only for experiment 3, a 20-inch\nLCD located 120 cm from the participant was used for the\nvisual display of symbolic button presses. In particular, a\nrow of three squares on a black background was presented\n(one for each button, spatially arranged to correspond to a\nreal opponent). The colour of these squares changed from\nred to white to depict the periods during which the opponent\nwas pressing the button. The behaviour of the opponent was\nthus marked in an abstract manner that reflected only the\nstate of the buttons (i.e. there was no movement and no\nschematic illustration of the opponent).\n(c) Procedure\nParticipants initially took part in a training session to familiar-\nize themselves with the task. They were instructed to start a\ntrial by resting their right-hand on the central button (the\n\u2018home key\u2019), then move to hit the button on their right, then\non their left, and then return to the central button and keep\nit depressed (figure 1a). Participants were informed that a\nvariable delay was imposed on each trial (no details given),\nso they had to wait for some time before starting their move-\nment. The random start delay was drawn from a normal\ndistribution (m \u00bc 2500 ms; s \u00bc 500 ms). Moving too early\ncaused a warning tone, indicating an early movement error.\nIf participants missed a button, or hit buttons out of sequence,\na different tone sounded. On the basis of either error type, the\ntrial was aborted and then repeated.\nIn competitive situations, participants sat facing another\nhuman player, or a display depicting their opponent\u2019s\nbutton presses. Testing sessions lasted approximately 1 h,\nyielding around 170 data points per condition per participant\nfor experiment 1, 100 for experiment 2 and 120 for exper-\niment 3. The relative number of initiated and reactive\nmovements within this total varied between participants\n(i.e. as a dynamic competition, this depended on the behav-\niour of individuals). In most situations, participants\ncompleted a side-to-side movement. However, experiment 2\nalso considered front\u2013back movements. Here, the board on\nwhich the buttons were mounted was rotated by 908 and\nre-attached to the table, aligned to the participant\u2019s midline.\n(d) Data analysis\nResponse times and movement execution times were calcu-\nlated using signals from the capacitive buttons. The\n\u2018reaction time\u2019 was defined as the time difference between\nthe first participant\u2019s centre button switching to an off\n(low) state, and their opponent\u2019s centre button switching to\nan off state (figure 1b). The \u2018execution time\u2019 for the first\nmovement phase was defined as the time between the\ncentre button being in a low (off) state and the right\nbutton being in a high (on) state. Subsequent movement\nphases were similarly calculated, with the total execution\ntime defined as the time between the centre button being\nlow (movement start) and high (movement end). Our use\nof capacitive buttons meant that downward force was not\nrequired\u2014rather light touch was sufficient to keep buttons\nin a high (on) state, thus movement onset was defined as\nthe moment at which the hand moved away from the buttons.\nData analysis considered the distribution of movement\nexecution times produced when participants moved before\n(initiated movements) or after (reactive movements) theirProc. R. Soc. Bopponents (figure 1c). Following Luce (1986), we quantified\nthese distributions using the harmonic mean to provide a\nrobust statistic suitable for non-Gaussian data (in fact,\nusing the arithmetic mean or the median made little differ-\nence). As participants could independently elect to initiate\na given trial at very similar times, some \u2018reactive\u2019 movements\nmight have in fact been \u2018initiated\u2019. We therefore discarded\ntrials on which a participant\u2019s reaction time was below\n100 ms (6.8% trials), reasoning that anything faster would\nbe unlikely to result from a reaction (note that this 100 ms\nexclusion criteria corresponds to the time difference between\nthe buttons being lifted, rather than any aspect of the\nopponent\u2019s behaviour that might signal their intention to\nmove). (We ensured that this 100 ms exclusion criterion\ndid not bias our findings by analysing our data without con-\nstraining the reaction time, and the results were unchanged.)\nWe used further criteria to deal with outliers in the movement\ntimes (Ratcliff 1993). One possibility was that a \u2018reactor\u2019\nwould miss their opponent\u2019s movement, responding with a\nconsiderable delay and thus in a non-competitive manner.\nTo avoid this possibility, data were excluded if the reaction\ntime exceeded 500 ms (3.5% of trials). Finally, on some\ntrials a participant would complete the sequence by correct-\ning for a missed button, producing a long, uncompetitive\nexecution time. Therefore, trials on which the execution\ntime exceeded 1000 ms (experiment 1) or 800 ms (experi-\nments 2, 3) were excluded (0.5% of trials). (Note that the\nlarger movement amplitude required in experiment 1 pro-\nduced longer execution times.) While error rates were\ngenerally low, some participants produced an unacceptably\nlarge number of errors, making their data unreliable. We\nexcluded one subject from experiment 2, and four subjects\nfrom experiment 3 because of a high proportion of slow reac-\ntion and slow execution errors (defined as more than 25%\nerrors in two or more conditions).3. RESULTS\n(a) Experiment 1\nTo investigate whether there was an advantage for reactive\nmovements, we considered within-subject differences in\nmovement execution times for trials on which partici-\npants initiated the movement sequence compared with\ntrials on which they reacted following the movement of\ntheir opponent (figure 1c). We found that execution\ntimes were quicker by an average of 21 ms when partici-\npants reacted to their opponent\u2019s movement (figure 2a;\nt9 \u00bc 4.406, p \u00bc 0.002), an improvement of around 9 per\ncent. This \u2018reactive advantage\u2019 was most pronounced for\nthe first movement of the three-button press sequence\n(figure 2b,c), quickening responses by around 14 per\ncent of the mean movement execution time. Moreover,\nthe advantage was maximal when participants moved\napproximately 200 ms after the opponent (electronic sup-\nplementary material). However, as the reactive advantage\nin movement execution (mean \u00bc 21 ms) was less than the\nparticipant\u2019s reaction time to the movement of their\nopponent (mean \u00bc 207 ms), reactors rarely beat initiators\n(e.g. compare the difference between the red boxplots for\na participant with the extent of their reaction time (blue\nboxplots) from figure 1c).\nThe proportion of failures to hit one of the buttons in\nthe sequence increased for reactive movements,\nsuggesting that increased speed is associated with reduced\n800(a) (b) (c)30 20\n18\n16\n14\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n\u20135 \u20132\n1st 2nd 3rd total\nmovement execution phase\n1st 2nd 3rd total\nmovement execution phase\n750\n700\nex\nec\nu\ntio\nn \ntim\ne \n(m\ns)\nre\nac\ntiv\ne \nad\nva\nn\nta\nge\n (m\ns)\nre\nac\ntiv\ne \nad\nva\nn\nta\nge\n (%\n)\n650\n600\n550\n500\ninitiate react\n450\nFigure 2.

Reaction beats intention\n on July 20, 2010rspb.royalsocietypublishing.orgDownloaded from accuracy (Woodworth 1899). This in and of itself does\nnot constitute a trivial explanation for our findings, as\nparticipants did not know a priori whether a reactive or\nintentional movement would be made. Had the roles of\ninitiator and reactor been predetermined at the start of\na trial, data interpretation would be complicated. In par-\nticular, if participants knew that they would react on a\ngiven trial, they could consciously elect to maximize\ntheir chances of winning the duel by producing faster\nand less accurate movements to compensate for the\ntime cost of reacting after their opponent. However, the\ndynamic nature of the competition meant that this was\nnot possible: both participants prepared to initiate the\nmovement sequence. Thus, like a quickening of execution\ntimes, a change in error rates suggests a dynamic compu-\ntation of movement influenced by the type of movement\nbeing produced. High-speed, low-accuracy movements\nmay constitute a characteristic of the neural systems\nresponsible for controlling reactive movements.\nA potentially trivial difference between movements\nexecuted under reactive and intentional conditions is that,\nwhen making a reactive movement, participants had been\nwaiting longer to move. Under some circumstances\npreparation time and movement speed are related\n(Rosenbaum et al. 1987; Bullock & Grossberg 1988),\npotentially suggesting a lurking variable between our two\nmovement classes. Our use of the covert random start\ndelay made this suggestion rather unlikely (the time from\nthe trial starting to the initiating participant\u2019s movement\nhad a between-trial standard deviation of 775 ms in contrast\nto typical reaction times of 200 ms). However, we tested\nthis idea by performing regressions of movement execution\ntime on the initiation time on a per subject basis, finding\nno evidence for the relationship between preparation and\nexecution times under our experimental paradigm.\nAn additional concern might relate to the warning tone\nthat indicated participants had moved before the end of the\ncovert delay period. In particular, the tone might effectively\nact as a \u2018penalty\u2019 that could change the movement strategyProc. R. Soc. Bso that participants were cautious, and thus slower, when\ninitiating the movement sequence. To test this idea, we\nran a control experiment on eight participants in which\nthe no intertrial delay was imposed. We found clear\nevidence for a reactive advantage (t7 \u00bc 8.426, p, 0.001)\nwhen there was no warning tone, ruling out this concern\nand suggesting that any penalizing effect of the warning\ntone was not responsible for faster reactive movements.\nThese data were also useful in allowing us to test for\nevidence of a speed-accuracy trade-off under our paradigm\n(we could not do this for the main experimental data as\nbutton press times were not recorded for error trials). In\nparticular, we considered the duration of the first move-\nment in the sequence of trials in which an error was\nsubsequently made (e.g. the participant missed button\n3 or 1 during subsequent movements). We compared the\nduration of these movements with those measured on\nsuccessful (non-error) trials, to test whether errors were\nassociated with faster movements. We found no evidence\nfor a difference between error and non-error movement\ntimes for either reactive (p \u00bc 0.27) or intentional\n(p \u00bc 0.80) movement sequences.\nFinally, our task requiring a movement sequence of\nthree distinct segments might be regarded as overly com-\nplex, with the necessity of reversing the direction of travel\nleading to uncertainty in hand position after the initial\nmovement has been made. In an additional control experi-\nment we asked participants to make a simple, single\nsegment movement (from button 3 to button 2) under\ncompetition. Consistent with our previous findings,\nwe observed clear evidence for a reactive advantage (t7 \u00bc\n3.852, p \u00bc 0.006) for this simple ballistic movement.(b) Experiment 2\nTo gain further insight into the reactive advantage, we\nasked whether the effect might accrue from having the\nopponent\u2019s movement as a model for one\u2019s own actions.\nIn particular, ventral premotor cortex is known to be\n20\n(a) (b)\n18\n16\n14\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\nplayer\nplayer 1\nplayer 2\n3\n3\n1\n1\n2\n2\nopponent\u2019s\nmove\nS-t-S\nsame different\nmovement condition\nphase 1 execution time total execution time\nre\nac\ntiv\ne \nad\nva\nn\nta\nge\n (%\n)\nF-B S-t-S F-B S-t-S\nsame different\nmovement condition\nF-B S-t-S F-B\nFigure 3.

Behaviourally,\nmovement production can be influenced by viewing an\naction that is either incongruent with one\u2019s own (Brass\net al. 2000) or a transformed version of what one has to\nperform (Craighero et al. 2002).\nTo investigate the possibility that the opponent\u2019s move-\nment facilitates movement production, we tested whether\nthe direction in which participants moved influenced the\nadvantage for reactive movements. In particular, partici-\npants performed the three-button press sequence when\nthe buttons were configured for side-to-side or front\u2013\nback movements (figure 3a). Thus, a player could see\ntheir opponent making a comparable movement that\ncould act as a model for their own movement (e.g. both\nplayers make a front\u2013back movement), or movement\northogonal to their own action that would be of less use\nin priming action preparation (e.g. one player moves\nfront\u2013back while the other moves side-to-side). Consist-\nent with our previous experiments, we observed a\nsignificant decrease in execution times for reactive move-\nments (F1,8 \u00bc 11.484, p \u00bc 0.01). However, there was no\nsignificant effect of viewing a different movement from\none\u2019s own (F1,8 \u00bc 3.273, p \u00bc 0.108) or any significant\ninteractions (figure 3b). Thus, the reactive advantage\ndoes not appear to be modulated by viewing the opponent\nmaking similar or dissimilar movements.\n(c) Experiment 3\nIn our final experiment, we tested whether the social con-\ntext within which the participants found themselves might\nbe responsible for their facilitated reactive movements.Proc. R. Soc. BPrevious work suggests differential performance when\nhumans believe they are interacting with another human\ncompared with a non-human agent such as a computer,\nbased on the notion that the mirror neuron system acts to\ndetermine the intentions of others (Kilner et al. 2003;\nStanley et al. 2007; Gowen et al. 2008). To examine the\nrole that might be played by cortical systems responsible\nfor encoding the intentions of others, we contrasted\nperformance when participants competed against another\nhuman (\u2018Person\u2019 condition) or a computer on whose\ndisplay movements were presented symbolically. In\ncomputer opponent conditions, participants were informed\neither (i) that they were competing against a computer\n(\u2018computer\u2019 condition), or (ii) that they were competing\nagainst another human located in a different testing room,\ninterfaced through the computer (\u2018virtual\u2019 condition). In\nactuality, the distribution of movement onset and move-\nment execution times produced by the computer was\ndetermined from data previously recorded from the partici-\npant, meaning that they were playing against a historical\nversion of themselves, and thus involved in a demanding\ncompetition. Debriefing participants at the end of the\nsession revealed this manipulation to have been successful,\nwith only one participant expressing doubts about the\nauthenticity of their computer-interfaced human opponent.\nConsistent with the previous experiments, faster move-\nments were observed under reactive conditions (F1,9 \u00bc\n26.689, p \u00bc 0.001). However, the type of opponent\nfaced by participants (human, computer, virtual\nhuman) neither had significant influence on execution\ntimes (F2,18 \u00bc 2.967, p \u00bc 0.077) nor was the interaction\nbetween the reactive advantage and the type of opponent\nsignificant (F2,18 \u00bc 1.650, p \u00bc 0.220). The statistical\nanalysis on the type of opponent might suggest a marginal\neffect.

E. Welchman et al. Reaction beats intention\n on July 20, 2010rspb.royalsocietypublishing.orgDownloaded from not suggest a pattern of results consistent with the\nhypothesis that the anthropomorphic nature of the\nopponent modulates the effect. In particular, if this\nhypothesis underlies the effect, we would expect the reac-\ntive advantage to be lowest for conditions in which the\nplayer believed they were competing with a computer.\nRather, the mean reactive advantage is lowest when par-\nticipants believed they were competing against another\nhuman interfaced through the computer.\nDespite this null result, the findings from this experi-\nment are useful in addressing concerns that might arise\nfrom the paradigm we have developed. In particular,\nunder conditions in which participants compete against\na computer, there is no visual motion and no auditory\ncues from the opponent, nor any cues of movement prep-\naration. A previous report suggests that movements are\nfaster when participants are able to see motion (Smeets &\nBrenner 1995), suggesting an alternative interpretation\nfor a benefit of viewing the opponent. However, this\ncannot explain our findings as the reactive advantage per-\nsists when there is no motion in the display (just three\nsimple illuminated squares). Moreover, auditory cues\nfrom the human opponent hitting their buttons could\nincrease arousal, or provide a movement-timing signal.\nHowever, such cues are not available when competing\nagainst a computer, as there was no physical movement\nor button pressing. Nevertheless, our findings were\nunchanged. Finally, in the context of bimanual reaching,\nit is known that participants slow down the easier of two\nmovements when reaching for two different targets, such\nthat both movements end simultaneously (Kelso et al.\n1979). Similar effects of movement coordination have\nbeen reported for social (two-person) movements\n(Georgiou et al. 2007). It could be argued that inten-\ntional movements are deliberately slowed to ensure\nsynchronous termination with an opponent\u2019s reactive\nmovement. The competition between participants and\nthe considerable delay imposed by reaction make this\nsuggestion unlikely. Moreover, the sparse display in com-\nputer-opponent conditions effectively rules out this\npossibility.Proc. R. Soc. B4. GENERAL DISCUSSION\nHere we consider the production of the same movement\nsequence under conditions in which participants initiate\nthe movement or react to an opponent. We demonstrate\nthat reactive movements are associated with faster\nexecution times, and that this quickening of movement\ndoes not appear to relate to having another human as a\nmodel for one\u2019s own action. We suggest different cortical\nprocessing routes for the control reactive versus inten-\ntional movements, and argue that faster movement\ndynamics may constitute a basic property of reactive\nmovement production.\nThe suggestion of a distinction between reactive versus\nintentional movements is consistent with a range of pre-\nvious studies that report changes in the balance of the\ninvolvement of a number of cortical and subcortical\nareas during the production of different classes of action\n(Laplane et al. 1977; Kurata & Tanji 1985; Romo &\nSchultz 1987; Mushiake et al. 1991; Halsband et al.\n1993; Cunnington et al. 1995, 2002; Deiber et al. 1999;\nJenkins et al. 2000; Maimon & Assad 2006; Sumner\net al. 2007). Previous behavioural work also supports\nthis distinction. For instance, countermanding the pro-\nduction of an intended movement to react to an\nexternal trigger can have a cost (Obhi & Haggard\n2004), suggesting a delay imposed by switching between\ndifferent modes of movement triggering (Obhi et al.\n2009b). Under our paradigm, participants could be pro-\nvoked to move sooner than they intended by seeing\ntheir opponent\u2019s actions. Based on Obhi and colleagues\u2019\nfindings, the initiation of such reactive movements may\nbe slower than the initiation of internally generated move-\nments. (This suggestion is, of course, untestable as we\nhave no access to the timing of participant\u2019s movement\ntriggering decisions.) Here, we assess a different aspect\nof movement production, demonstrating that reactive\nmovements can be advantageous in producing faster\nexecution times (albeit with increased error rates).\nIt is interesting to speculate about the neural circuits\nthat might be involved in the production of the movements\nwe have studied. One candidate region of importance is the\npre-supplementary motor area (SMA) region of the medial\nfrontal cortex that is implicated in the control of intentional\nactions. Moreover, it is thought to play a key role in\nswitching between different tasks (Rushworth et al. 2002)\nand selecting an intentional action over a reactive one\n(Isoda & Hikosaka 2007). It is possible that the pre-\nSMA functions to remove the inhibition of potential\nactions\u2014a function carried out by the SMA (Sumner\net al. 2007)\u2014thereby giving rise to the production of the\nintentional movement sequence. The production of reac-\ntive movements may involve an alternative route that\ndisinhibits the planned movement sequence via the parietal\ncortex (Cunnington et al. 2006). Our observation that the\nreactive advantage is focused on the initial, ballistic phase\nof movement is suggestive of an effect limited to movement\nonset rather than being general to the production of a\nsequence of arm movements. This suggests different\ntypes of disinhibition for reactive and intentional move-\nments. In particular, disinhibition designed to prevent\nearly movement (Sinclair & Hammond 2009; see Obhi\net al. 2009a for an excellent discussion) may be faster via\nthe parietal route, resulting in increased acceleration and\nreduced movement execution times.\nReaction beats intention A. E. Welchman et al. 7\n on July 20, 2010rspb.royalsocietypublishing.orgDownloaded from Faster movement speed for reactive movements has a\nparallel to known deficits in Parkinson\u2019s disease. In par-\nticular, Parkinson\u2019s patients are especially compromised\nin speed when making intentional, rather than reactive,\nreaching arm movements (Majsak et al. 1998). Differ-\nences between reactive and intentional movement\nsystems may thus become more apparent in Parkinson\u2019s\nas the basal ganglia makes a greater contribution to inten-\ntional actions (Roland et al. 1982; Jones 1987). Testing\nParkinson\u2019s patients with our paradigm would be of inter-\nest as concerns about high-level speed-accuracy decisions,\nor strategies for different experimental (i.e. self-paced\nversus stimulus-driven) conditions could be ruled out.\nWe interpret our results as reflecting the operation of\ndifferent processing routes for intentional versus reactive\nmovements; however, might the results rather reflect a\ndeliberate strategy by participants, and thus not imply\ndifferent neural architectures? In particular, perhaps\nparticipants deliberately change their movements according\nto whether a reactive or an intentional movement is\nrequired, optimizing their actions by speeding up on reac-\ntive trials when there is less chance of \u2018winning\u2019 the duel,\nand slowing down on intentional trials to minimize\nenergetic cost. This would be possible had participants\nknown ahead of time whether an intentional or a reactive\nmovement was required. However, under our paradigm,\nthe dynamic nature of the competition meant that\nparticipants have little opportunity to change their move-\nments deliberately, as on any given trial they might be the\ninitiator or the reactor, and reaction times were low\n(ca 200 ms).\nIt could also be argued that individuals learn about\ntheir opponent\u2019s behaviour across trials, thereby develop-\ning a strategy based on the probability of making an\nintentional or reactive movement on a particular trial.\nWe believe this is unlikely as there was no feedback at\nthe end of each trial and participants were thus very\nfrequently unaware of who had won the duel (detecting\nthe small temporal offsets between one\u2019s own actions\nand that of the opponent in the context of a rapid\ncompetition was not easy). Moreover, under some cir-\ncumstances (experiment 3), participants were effectively\nplaying against themselves, making it difficult to argue\nthat participants exploited differences between their own\nbehaviour and that of their opponent to maximize their\nchance of winning the duel. However, we tested whether\nthere was a systematic relationship between the prob-\nability of being a \u2018reactor\u2019 and the reactive advantage.\n(Data were pooled across experiments to maximize stat-\nistical power, and the reactive advantage was expressed\nas a percentage to minimize the influence of between-\nsubject differences in movement times.) We found no\nevidence of a relationship between the probability of\nreacting and the increased speed of reactive movements\n(r \u00bc 0.11, F1,39, 1, p \u00bc 0.485).\nAs a general survival strategy, the evolution of a move-\nment system capable of producing quick (and possibly\ndirtier) movements that support faster responses to the\nenvironment seems reasonable. However, within the con-\ntext of a gunfight, a strategy based purely on reaction\nseems unlikely to increase evolutionary fitness as the\nadvantage produced by reacting is far outweighed by the\ntime taken to react to the opponent. Anecdotal reports\nsuggest that Bohr tested his original idea with colleagueProc. R. Soc. BGeorge Gamow using toy pistols, with the \u2018reactive\u2019\nBohr apparently winning every duel (Cline 1987). Our\ndata make it unlikely that these victories can be ascribed\nto the benefits associated with reaction. Rather, they\nsuggest that Bohr was a crack shot, in addition to being\na brilliant physicist.All participants gave written informed consent and local\nethics committees approved the experiments.\nThis work was supported by grants from the Biotechnology\nand Biological Sciences Research Council (C520620,\nEO09565), the Wellcome Trust (069439), a post-doctoral\nstipend from the Max Planck Gesellschaft and the WCU\n(World Class University) programme through the\nNational Research Foundation of Korea funded by the\nMinistry of Education, Science and Technology (R31-\n2008-000-10008-0).
