Radioactive-decay studies, \neclipsed in the 1980\u2019s and 1990\u2019s by in-beam \u03b3-ray spectroscopy and heavy-ion \nfusion-evaporation reactions, are enjoying a revitalization as one of the most important \ntechniques to learn about nuclear structure, address questions in nuclear astrophysics, \nand explore physics beyond the current Standard Model. The advantages of modern \u03b2-\ndecay studies over those performed even a decade ago are the tremendous increases in \ninstrumental resolving powers, sensitivities, and data analysis with modern computers. \nIn the present paper, work involving \u03b2-decay spectroscopy at the Isotope Separator \nand Accelerator (ISAC) facility of the TRI-University Meson Facility (TRIUMF) is \nreported. Much effort has been devoted in the past five years to build a highly \nsensitive and versatile device for decay studies centered on the 8pi \u03b3-ray spectrometer \nand its auxiliary detectors. A wide and varied programme of nuclear structure, nuclear \nastrophysics, and weak-interaction studies is being pursued. \n \nINSTRUMENTAL CAPABILITIES \nThe 8pi spectrometer and its associated auxiliary detectors currently comprises 4 \ndifferent detector systems: Compton-suppressed Ge detectors (the 8pi spectrometer) \nfor \u03b3-ray detection, plastic scintillators (named the SCintillating Electron Positron \nTagging ARray \u2013 SCEPTAR) for detection of \u03b2 particles, BaF2 detectors (named the \nDipentagonal Array for Nuclear Timing Experiments \u2013 DANTE) for \u03b3-ray detection \nwith fast-timing measurements, and Si(Li) detectors (named the Pentagonal Array for \nConversion Electron Spectroscopy \u2013 PACES) for conversion electron studies. The \nISAC low-energy beam is focused on a segment of \u00bd\u2033 wide tape at the center of these \narrays. The Moving Tape Collector (MTC) can then be used to transport the deposited \nsample into a shielded tape box away from the detectors at predetermined time \nintervals using a computer-controlled stepping motor. The beam ON\/OFF times, and \ntape movement intervals, frequencies, and dwell times are all variable limited only by \nthe beam-pulsing response time (\u00ab10 ms), and tape movement speed. The MTC \nsystem allows separation of parent\/daughter\/granddaughter\/etc. decays of differing \nhalf-lives, an indispensable feature at an online isotope separator like the ISAC \nfacility. \nThe 8pi Spectrometer  \nThe 8pi spectrometer is based on a geometrical arrangement of 20 hexagonal and 12 \npentagonal shapes. The 20 Ge detectors, Ortec HPGe with a nominal relative \nefficiency of \u223c25%, occupy the hexagonal positions, with 4 rings of 5 detectors at \nangles of \u00b137\u00b0 and \u00b179\u00b0 with respect to the beam direction. The target-to-front-face \ndistance for the BGO suppression shields is 13 cm, and that for the Ge detectors is 14 \ncm. The absolute photopeak efficiency of the reconfigured array has been measured \nfor the 1332-keV 60Co line to be 1.5%, with a peak-to-total ratio of 0.41. To \ndemonstrate the sensitivity of the reconfigured 8pi array, shown in Fig. 1 are results \n250\nDownloaded 03 Oct 2006 to 130.202.94.161. Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright, see http:\/\/proceedings.aip.org\/proceedings\/cpcr.jsp\nfrom an experiment [1] using a 26Na beam of 106 ions\/s of 10-hour duration. A \nsensitivity on the relative \u03b2-decay branching on the order of 10\u22126 was achieved.   \n \n \nFIGURE 1.  Photograph (left) of the upstream portion of the SCEPTAR plastic scintillator array (the \npentagon shaped object in the center of the target chamber) and one hemisphere of the 8pi array. The \nSCEPTAR array covers ~80% of the solid angle, and each plastic scintillator shadows a particular Ge \ndetector. The partial spectrum (right) was obtained from a 10hr run with a beam of 106 26Na s\u22121 and \ndisplays the sensitivity of 10\u22126 for weak \u03b2 branches achieved.  \n \nSCEPTAR \nComplementing the Ge detectors are 20 plastic scintillators of SCEPTAR. Arranged \ninto 2 rings of 5 trapezoidal pieces and 2 rings of 5 rectangular pieces, the positioning \nis such that one plastic scintillator overlaps the solid angle of one Ge detector. This \npermits the rejection of bremsstrahlung events in a Ge detector due to the stopping of \nthe very-high-energy \u03b2 particles often encountered in far-from-stability radioactive \ndecays. The total solid angle coverage of SCEPTAR is approximately 80% of 4pi. The \nplastic scintillators are BC410 of thickness 1.6 mm. Light is collected from the edge of \nthe scintillators and transported via \u223c25 cm long light-guides to the phototubes located \noutside of the main frame of the array. Figure 1 contains a photo showing portions of \nthe 8pi and SCEPTAR arrays.   \nPACES \nThe most recent addition to the arsenal of detectors is PACES.  An array of 5 Si(Li) \ndetectors, PACES makes available both conversion-electron and internal-pair \nspectroscopy, the latter of which is advantageous far from stability where the Q-value \nis large.  Inclusion of conversion-electron data provides not only multipolarity \ninformation, but also reveals electric monopole (E0) transitions indicative of shape \ncoexistence. The Si(Li) detectors are approximately 5 mm in thickness and have a \ntypical resolution of 2.5 keV at 1 MeV. A close-up view of the PACES array is shown \nin Fig. 2. A recent experiment [2] using PACES investigated the decay of a newly \n6744 keV \nIrel=3.5(8)\u00d710-6 \n7370 keV s.e. \n251\nDownloaded 03 Oct 2006 to 130.202.94.161.

The 2.29(1) s isomer was first observed with the 8pi \nspectrometer only [3]; based on X-ray yields, it was suggested that the 100-keV and \n152-keV transitions observed were M1 in nature. However, it was not known if the \nfull decay intensity had been observed, making a spin assignment for the isomeric \nlevel uncertain. This experiment was recently repeated with the inclusion of PACES, \nwhere an E3 multipolarity for the 152-keV transition was determined based on \nconversion-electron sub-shell ratios as shown in Fig. 2. The spin-parity for the \nisomeric level is now suggested to be 0+ [2].  \n \nFIGURE 2.  Photograph (left) of the PACES array of Si(Li) detectors for conversion electrons, and the \nlow-energy portion of spectrum (right) collected with PACES gated on the 100-keV transition \nfollowing the isomer decay in 174Tm. \n \n \nDANTE \nThe ten BaF2 detectors of DANTE are being installed in the available open \npentagonal positions of the spectrometer for fast timing measurements. The BaF2 \nscintillator is the fastest known; one of its two scintillating-light components has a \ndecay constant of 0.6 ns and emits light in the UV region. The detectors are coupled to \nvery fast photomultiplier tubes, the Photonis XP2020\/URQ, having a quartz entrance \nwindow for maximum transmission of the fast-component UV light. An initial test \nexperiment [4] to accurately map the time response of the SCEPTAR plastic \nscintillators and test the feasibility of the DANTE array used 4 BaF2 detectors from \nthe University of Surrey. Using a 26Na radioactive beam, it was found that the \nindividual SCEPTAR detectors had timing resolutions (FWHM) in the range of 1\u22121.5 \nns. With BaF2-BaF2 coincidences, on the other hand, the timing FWHM of \u2248200 ps \nwas ultimately achieved. In addition to determining the timing resolution, a novel \nCompton-rejection scheme for the BaF2 detectors was also investigated. Since five \nBGO shields of neighbouring Ge detectors form a pentagonal ring around each BaF2 \ndetector, the BGO signals were used to form a BaF2 Compton veto. This reduced the \nbackground significantly, even though the geometry was not optimum. This test may \n252\nDownloaded 03 Oct 2006 to 130.202.94.161. Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright, see http:\/\/proceedings.aip.org\/proceedings\/cpcr.jsp\nbe the first time that such timing BaF2 detectors have been Compton suppressed [4]. \nThis will lead to a significant reduction in the systematic uncertainty assigned to the \nshort level lifetimes, since one of the dominating contributions arises from the \nCompton distribution under the peak of interest.    \nEXPERIMENTAL PROGRAMMES \nAs the 8pi spectrometer is such a versatile array, a widely varied set of experiments \nhave been proposed addressing nuclear structure, nuclear astrophysics, and Standard \nModel tests.  Studies to date have included: 1) the \u03b2 decay of 11Li, to study the \npossibility of neutron-halo \u201csurvival\u201d during the \u03b2 decay process [5], 2) 18Ne [6], 3) \n35Ar [7], and 4) 62Ga [8], as part of the super-allowed Fermi \u03b2-decay programme, 5) \n26Na [1], (our workhorse test beam), 6) 32Na to investigate the structure of 32Mg and \nthe island of inversion, 7) 156Ho and 8) 158Tm decay as part of the programme to study \nshape-phase transitions in the N=90 isotones, and isomeric states in 9) 174Tm [2\u20133], \n10) 178Hf [9], and 11) 178,179Lu [10]. There are a number of other accepted \nexperiments: search for seniority isomers in the mass 80 and 100 regions, structure of \nneutron-rich Cd and Pd isotopes in connection with r-process nucleosynthesis in the \nmass 120 region, additional experiments in the N=90 region, studies of 14Be, a study \nof the possible s-process branch point 115Cd, etc. This list will continue to grow as \nISAC develops more production targets and ion sources to provide a richer variety of \nradioactive beams. \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThis work has been supported by; the Natural Sciences and Research Council of \nCanada, the US Department of Energy, the Brookhaven Technology Group, the \nEngineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, and TRIUMF through the \nNational Research Council.
