Introduction\nRecent  advances  in  micro-electro-mechanical  systems  (MEMS)  technology,  wireless\ncommunications  and  digital electronics  have  enabled  the  development  of  low-cost,  low-power,\nmultifunctional smart sensor nodes. Smart sensor nodes are autonomous devices equipped with heavily\nintegrated  sensing,  processing,  and  communication capabilities.  When  these  nodes  are  networked\ntogether in an ad-hoc fashion, they form a sensor network. The nodes gather data via their sensors,\nprocess  it  locally or  coordinate  amongst neighbors and forward the information to  the user  or,  in\ngeneral, a data sink.\nSince these integrated sensor nodes have highly compact form factors and are wireless, they are\nhighly energy constrained. Furthermore, replenishing energy via replacing batteries on up to thousands\nof  nodes  (in  possibly  harsh  terrain)  is  infeasible.  Hence,  it  is  well  accepted  that  one  of  the  key\nchallenges in unlocking the potential of such data gathering sensor networks is conserving energy so as\nto  maximize their  post-deployment active  lifetime.  In  terms  of  energy  consumption,  the  wireless\nexchange  of  data  between  nodes  strongly  dominates  other  node  functions  such  as  sensing  and\nprocessing. Moreover, actual radios consume power not only when sending and receiving data, but also\nwhen listening. Stemm and Katz show idle:receive:transmit ratios are 1:1.05:1.4 by measurement [1],\nwhile more recent studies show ratios of 1:2:2.5 [2] and 1:1.2:1.7[3]. Significant energy savings are\nonly obtainable by putting as many nodes as possible to sleep. \nTopology management provides the distributed resources to the overlying applications in an energy\nefficient manner to achieve the service requirements for the maximum possible time. Taking advantage\nof high-density deployment, each node can assess its connectivity and adapts its participation in the\nmulti-hop network topology based  on local  measurements to extend overall  system lifetime. If  we\nincrease the radio range there are more nodes in the collaborative area, which can decide to go to sleep\nand therefore prolong the network\u2019s lifetime. So far, we have assumed that the energy demanded for\ntransmission is independent of the distance. In fact, airborne radio transmissions are attenuated by a\npath loss in a power-law with distance. Since the path loss of radio transmission scales with distance in\na greater-than-linear fashion [11],  the total  transmission energy can be reduced by dividing a long\ntransmission path into several shorter ones. Now the problem is how can we reach the optimal range for\nenergy  efficient  routing  that  uses  the  smallest  amount  of  energy  for  data  transmission  while\nsimultaneously allowing many nodes  to  be  put  into  the  sleep  state.  In  this  paper  we deduce  the\nrelationship between optimal radio range and traffic and find that half of the power can be saved if the\nradio range is adjusted according to the optimum strategy in a linear network compared with the best\ncase where equal radio ranges are used.\n2. Radio Power Model and Characteristic Distance\nFor a simplified power model of radio communication [4][5], the energy consumed per second in\ntransmission is:\n1 Corresponding author.

W. Marshall), x-h.peng@aston.ac.uk (X. H. Peng)\nE t=\ue09eet +ed r\nn \ue09fB (1)\nwhere  et is  the  energy\/bit  consumed by  the  transmitter  electronics  (including energy costs  of\nimperfect duty cycling due to finite startup time), and ed accounts for energy dissipated in the transmit\nop-amp (including op-amp inefficiencies). Both et and ed are properties of the transceiver used by the\nnodes, r is the transmission range used. The parameter n is the power index for the channel path loss of\nthe antenna. This factor depends on the RF environment and is generally between 2 and 4. B is the bit\nrate of the radio and is a fixed parameter in our study.\nOn the receiving side, a fixed amount of power is required to capture the incoming radio signal\nE r =er B\n(2)\nwhere er is the energy\/bit consumed by the receiver electronics used by the node. Typical numbers\nfor currently available radio tranceivers are et=50x10-9 J\/bit, er=50x10-9 J\/bit, ed=100x10-12 J\/bit\/m2 (for\nn=2) and B=1Mbit\/s [6].\nSince the path loss of radio transmission scales with distance in a greater-than-linear fashion, the\ntransmission energy can be reduced by dividing a long path into several shorter ones. However, if the\nnumber of intermediate nodes is very large then the energy consumption per node is dominated by the\nterm et in equation (1) and the receiving energy consumption hence an optimum exists. Intermediate\nnodes between a data source and destination can serve as relays that receive and rebroadcast data\nLet us consider multihop communication in a finite one dimensional network from the source to the\nbase station across a distance d using k hops. The source at x=d will generate traffic of A Erlang, so that\neach intermediate node receives and transmits the same traffic, A. The routing nodes are assumed to be\nregularly spaced and to consume no energy while idle. The power consumed by this communication is\nthen simply the sum of the transmit and receive energies multiplied by the effective bit rate, BA, and is\ngiven by\nP=\u2211\ni=1\nk\n\ue09eet +ed r in +e r \ue09fB A,\u2211\ni=1\nk\nr i =d\n(3)\nIn order to minimize P we note that it is strictly convex and use Jensen\u2019s inequality. Given d and k\nthen  P is  minimized when all  the  hop  distances  ri are  made  equal  to  d\/k.  The  minimum energy\nconsumption for a given distance d has either no intervening hops or kopt equidistant hops where kopt is\nalways one of,\nk opt=\ue09e dd char \ue09f  or k opt=\ue09e dd char \ue09f\n(4)\nThe distance dchar, called the characteristic distance, is independent of d and is given by,\nd char=\nn\ue08d et +ered \ue09en \u22121 \ue09f\n(5)\nThe characteristic distance depends only on the energy consumption of the hardware and the path\nloss coefficient (i.e. it is independent of the traffic); dchar alone determines the optimal number of hops.\nFor  typical  COTS  (commercial,  off-the-shelf)-based  sensor  nodes,  dchar is  about  35  meters.  The\nintroduction  of  relay  nodes  is  clearly  a  balancing  act  between  reduced  transmission energy  and\nincreased receive energy. Hops that are too short lead to excessive receive energy. Hops that are too\nlong lead to excessive path loss. In between these extremes is an optimum transmission distance that is\nthe characteristic distance.\n3. Topology Management\nThe traffic distribution through appropriate routing essentially exploits the macro-scale redundancy\nof possible routes between source and destination. However, on each route, there is also a micro-scale\nredundancy of  nodes  that  are  essentially equivalent  for  the  multi-hop path.  In  typical  deployment\nscenarios, a dense network is required to ensure adequate coverage of both the sensing and multi-hop\nrouting  functionality,  in  addition  to  improving network fault-tolerance.  Despite  the  inherent  node\nredundancy, these high densities do not immediately result in an increased network lifetime, as the radio\nenergy consumption in idle mode does not differ much from that in transmit or receive mode. Only\ntransitioning the radio into the sleep state can temporarily quiescent nodes to conserve battery energy.\nHowever, in this state, nodes cannot be communicated with, and have effectively retracted from the\nnetwork, thereby changing the active topology. Thus, the crucial issue is to intelligently manage the\nsleep state transitions while maintaining robust undisturbed operation.\nThis reasoning is the foundation for topology management approach, which explicitly leverages the\nfact that in high node density several nodes can be considered backups of each other with respect to\ntraffic forwarding. Achieving energy saving through activation of a limited subset of nodes in an ad-hoc\nwireless network has also been the goal of some recent research such as GAF [7], SPAN [3], ASCENT\n[8], CEC [9] and AFECA [10].\nIn SPAN, a limited set of nodes forms a multi-hop forwarding backbone, which tries to preserve the\noriginal  capacity  of  the  underlying  ad-hoc  network.  Other  nodes  transition  to  sleep  states  more\nfrequently, as they no longer carry the burden of forwarding data of other nodes. To balance out energy\nconsumption, the  backbone  functionality is  rotated  between nodes  and  therefore  there  is  a  strong\ninteraction with the routing layer.\nIn ASCENT, the decision for being active is the courtesy of the node. Passive nodes keep listening\nall the time and assess their course of actions; stay passive or become active.\nCluster-based Energy Conservation (CEC) and the Adaptive Fidelity Energy-Conserving Algorithm\n(AFECA) are two other proposed energy conserving topology management algorithms. CEC creates\nclusters and selects cluster-heads based on the highest advertised remaining energy. AFECA allows\neach node to sleep for randomized periods based on the number of (overheard) neighbors it has. \nThe GAF algorithm is based on a division of the sensor network in a number of virtual grids of size\nR by R, see Figure 1. The value of R is chosen such that all nodes in a grid are equivalent from a routing\nperspective. This means that any two nodes in adjacent grids should be able to communicate with each\nother.  By investigating the worst-case node locations depicted in Figure 1, we can calculate that  R\nshould satisfy\nR \u2264 r\n\ue08d5\n(6)\nFor the one dimension case, R should satisfy\nR \u2264r \/2 (7)\nr\nR\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nFigure 1: GAF virtual grid structure\nSince all nodes in a grid are equivalent from a routing perspective, we can use this redundancy to\nincrease the network lifetime. GAF only keeps one node awake in each grid, while the other nodes put\ntheir radio in the sleep mode. To balance out the energy consumption, the burden of traffic forwarding\nis  rotated  between  nodes.  For  simplicity, we ignore  the  unavoidable  time overlap  of  this  process\nassociated with handoff. If there are m nodes in a grid, the node will (ideally) only turn its radio on for a\nfraction 1\/m of the time and therefore will last  m times longer. If we increase the radio transmission\nrange,  r,  there will be more nodes within each grid and hence more redundant nodes can make the\ntransition into the sleep state and therefore a longer network lifetime can be achieved. Since the energy\nconsumption associated with transmission increases super-linearly with radio range, there will be an\noptimum range that provides the maximum energy saving. \nTopology management algorithms work well in high density sensor networks. They let redundant\nnodes go to sleep and network life is prolonged while the connection and capacity of the networks are\npreserved. For GAF there are many nodes in a grid section when densities are high and long lifetime\ncan be achieved. Furthermore in high-density networks if some nodes are transition into sleep state,\ncollisions can be reduced when several neighboring nodes compete to access the transmission medium.\nAnd overhearing energy waste can be reduced as well for topology management strategy.\n4. Relationship between Range and Traffic \nIn section 2 we introduced a simple energy model in which no energy was consumed while the node\nwas idle. This led to a characteristic distance that was independent of traffic. We now include the idle\nstate  energy and show how the characteristic  distance  is  modified.  On one  hand a  short  range  is\npreferred for energy efficient data transmission as a result of the nonlinear path loss ratio. On the other\nhand more redundant nodes can be put into the sleep state to prolong the network lifetime if a long\nrange is used in the topology management of sensor networks. So what is the optimal range from an\nenergy efficiency perspective? Again, we consider a linear network of length  d in which the traffic\ncarried from end to end is A Erlang. If the transmission route is divided into k grids and only one node\nwakes up in each grid as relay node, as in the GAF protocol, the total energy consumption per second\nby k hops is\nP=k [ er BA+et BA+ed \ue09e2\nd\nk\n\ue09fn BA+ce r \ue09e1\u22122 A \ue09fB ]\n(8)\nThe last term  cer(1-2A)B in the equation (8) represents the energy consumption when the radio\nneither receives nor transmits, i.e. it is in the idle state. The energy consumption in the idle state is\napproximately equal to that in the receiving state, so that the parameter c is close to 1. Note that we are\ncurrently assuming that nodes in the sleep state consume no energy. Also, we assume that the routing\nnode in each grid can be located anywhere within that section and so the radio range is now twice the\ngrid size. The energy efficient optimum size of the virtual grid can now be derived from equation (8)\nand is given by\nR opt =r opt \/2=\nn\ue08d \ue09eer +et \ue09fA+cer \ue09e1\u22122 A \ue09f2n A\ue09en \u22121 \ue09fed\n(9)\nThe minimum energy consumption characteristic range is no longer a constant and changes with the\namount of traffic. Figure 2 shows the relationship between the traffic A and the optimal range ropt. The\noptimal range is  decreasing as the loaded traffic increases. At the extreme point  A=0.5,  where the\ntransmitter spends 50% of the time transmitting and 50% receiving (we assume the node can only do\none or the other), there is no idle time and so the optimal range converges to dchar. Under conditions of\nlight  traffic  the  optimal  range  increases  sharply  as  the  loaded  traffic  decreases.  When  the  data\ntransferred in the sensor network is low, the idle state dominates the energy consumption and hence the\nradio range can be relatively large.\n0 0 . 0 5 0 . 1 0 . 1 5 0 . 2 0 . 2 5 0 . 3 0 . 3 5 0 . 4 0 . 4 5 0 . 5\n0\n5 0\n1 0 0\n1 5 0\n2 0 0\n2 5 0\nTraffic A(Erlang)\nOptimum\nrange, ropt (m)\nFigure 2: Optimum radio range as a function of the network traffic\n5. Transmission Range Adjustment\nSo far, we have only considered data in transit across a linear network of routing nodes. In a real\nsensor network, the data are generated internally.  In many applications of wireless sensor networks,\ndata is gathered by multiple sensors at different locations and transmitted to a single sink node (such as\na base station) where data can be stored and analyzed. If the relay node is close to the sink there is more\ntraffic to be forwarded than for that of the relay nodes far from the sink. For more energy efficient\ntransmission this node can use short range transmission according to the relationship between optimal\nrange and loaded traffic that we have deduced above for the transport network. However, nodes far\nfrom the sink have less data to forward and have longer idle times therefore they should use a longer\nradio range such that nodes not involved in routing can be put into the sleep state. Thus we are led to\nconsider a non-uniform grid covering the network.\nIn this section we consider a sensor network collecting data at all nodes and forwarding all the data\nto a base station. We will compare the normal uniform grid of the GAF protocol with non-uniform grids\nwhere the grid size is adjusted according to the local traffic level. We consider a linear network where\nthe density of nodes is uniform. The network contains a single sink on one edge at x=0. If each node\nproduces  a Erlang of data then the traffic to be forwarded at a point that is x meters away from base\nstation is\nA\ue09e x \ue09f=\ue09e d \u2212x \ue09fn d a\n(10)\nwhere  d is the size of the network and  nd is the node density. Figure 3 shows a network that is\ncovered by such a virtual grid.\nr1=R1\nd\nBase \nstation\nr2=R2+ R1\nr3=R3+R2\nR3 R2 R1\nx\nFigure 3: Linear network divided by virtual grids of different size\n We  consider  two heuristic  algorithms based  on  the  range-traffic relationship  (9).  In  the  first\nalgorithm, the grid sizes for grid section-specific traffic levels are calculated iteratively as follows \nR 1=R opt \ue09e x=R 1 \ue09f ,R 2 =R opt \ue09e x=R 2 +R 1 \ue09f ,\u22ef ,R i =R opt \ue09e x=\u2211\nj=1\ni\nR j \ue09f\n(11)\nwhere Ropt is the optimal grid size for the regular transport network derived in section 2, equation\n(9).  To guarantee any node in one grid section can connect to any node in the immediately adjacent\ndownstream grid section, the radio range in each section has been chosen as follows\nr 1 =R 1 ,r 2 =R 2 +R 1 ,\u22ef,r i =R i +R i\u22121\n(12)\nIn the case where the length of the linear network is d=600 m, node density nd=1\/6 per meter and\nevery node produces data at a rate a=0.003 Erlang, the energy efficient optimal grid sizes are shown in\ntable 1.\ni Ri(m)\n1 20.8\n2 21.2\n3 21.6\n4 22.0\n5 22.5\n6 23.1\n7 23.7\n8 24.4\n9 25.1\n10 26.0\n11 27.0\n12 28.2\n13 29.6\n14 31.4\n15 33.7\n16 37.0\n17 42.1\n18 53.7\n19 86.7\nTable 1.

The total power consumption due to receiving bits in the\ni\u2019th grid section is given by\nP r \ue09e i \ue09f=er \ue09e d \u2212R 1\u2212. . .\u2212R i \ue09fn d aB\n(13)\nRecall that the transmitted traffic in the ith grid,  At(i)=(d-R1-\u2026-Ri)nda,  is different to the received\ntraffic, At(i)=(d-R1-\u2026-Ri-1)nda, and so the power consumed by transmission in the ith grid is\nE t \ue09e i \ue09f={ \ue09eet +ed R 1n \ue09f dn d aB , i= 1[ e t +ed \ue09eR i +R i\u22121 \ue09fn ]\ue09e d \u2212R 1\u2212. . .\u2212r i\u22121 \ue09fn d aB , i> 1\n(14)\nThe energy consumption of the relay node during the fractional idle time Tidle(i)=1-2(d-R1-\u2026-Ri)nda\nis\nP idle \ue09e i \ue09f=e r [1\u22122\ue09e d \u2212R 1\u2212. . .\u2212R i \ue09fn d a ]B\n(15)\nHere we suppose the energy consumption in the idle state is the same as in the receiving state. The\ntotal power consumption of the whole network is\nP=\u2211\ni=1\nk\nP r \ue09e i \ue09f +P t \ue09e i \ue09f +P idle \ue09e i \ue09f\n(16)\n \nFor the specific case represented by the network grid in table 1 we find the total power consumption\nto be, P=9.51x10-4J\/s. \nHowever,  we can  improve  still  further  on  the total  power  consumption since  the  radio  range\nri=Ri+Ri+1, which we actually use in the i\u2019th grid, is not quite the same as the optimal range assumed in\ncalculating the grid size (ri=2Ri, see equation (9)). To save a little more power we should choose the\noptimal radio range instead of optimal grid size as we have done. The grid sizes and radio ranges can\nthen be calculated as follows\nR 1+R 2 =r opt \ue09e x=R 1 +R 2 \ue09f ,\nR 2 +R 3 =r opt \ue09e x=R 1 +R 2 +R 3 \ue09f ,\u22ef,R i\u22121 +R i =r opt \ue09e x=\u2211\nj=1\ni\nR j \ue09f (17)\nThe first grid, R1, is no longer specified by the algorithm (this is due to a boundary condition effect\nso  that  the  radio  range  required  in  the  first  and  second  grid  sections  is  determined  by  identical\nequations) and it can be chosen from the range 0\u2264R 1\u2264[R 1+R 2\u2261r opt \ue09e x=R 1+R 2 \ue09f] . The\nenergy consumption of the whole network is almost invariant to the value of R1 when R1 is chosen from\na large region around ropt(x=R1+R2)\/2. To ensure the grid sizes change evenly and also that there is a\nhigh probability of finding a node in the grids we adopt R1=ropt(x=R1+R2)\/2. The grid sizes calculated\naccording to algorithm 2 are shown in table 2 (note that the number of grids is one fewer in this case).\ni Ri(m)\n1 21.2\n2 21.2 \n3 22.0 \n4 22.1\n5 23.1\n6 23.2 \n7 24.3\n8 24.6 \n9 25.9\n10 26.4 \n11 28.0\n12 28.8\n13 31.1\n14 32.7 \n15 36.5 \n16 40.6 \n17 52.2 \n18 116\nTable 2. Grid sizes according to the algorithm of equations (17)\nThe total energy consumption is now  P=9.01x10-4J\/s which is slightly better than the result we\nobtained for algorithm 1. \nWe now compare our range adjustment GAF algorithm with the unmodified GAF protocol where a\nuniform grid solution is used as shown in Figure 4.\nr1=Rri=2R\nd\nBase \nstation\nFigure 4: Linear network divided by equal size virtual grids\nThe energy consumption in the transmission, receiving and idle states respectively are \nP t \ue09ei \ue09f={ \ue09ee t +ed R n \ue09f dn d aB, i= 1[et +ed \ue09e2R \ue09fn ] [ d \u2212\ue09ei \u22121 \ue09fR ]n d aB, i> 1 (18)\nP r \ue09e i \ue09f=e r \ue09e d \u2212iR \ue09fn d aB\n(19)\nP idle \ue09e i \ue09f=e r [1\u22122\ue09e d \u2212iR \ue09fn d a ]B\n(20)\nThe grid size  R is undetermined and is chosen from 0<R \u2264 d .  To obtain a more energy\nefficient GAF protocol,  R should be determined by some other methods. In Figure 5, the total energy\nconsumption is plotted versus the number of grids for equal grid division. The energy consumption for\nthe unequal grid division is also shown in Figure 5 as a single point since the number of grid sections is\nno longer a free parameter. We see that lower energy consumption has been achieved when the linear\nnetwork is divided into a virtual routing grid according to the new range-traffic relationship we have\nproposed rather than using equal grid division. In our specific case, 50% of the total power is saved\ncompared with the best case of equal grid division where the total energy consumption is 2.1x10-3J\/s. \n10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nx 10-3\nEnergy \nconsumption,\n P  (J\/s)\nNumber of grid sections, K \nEqual range\nRange adjustment: algorithm 1\nRange adjustment: algorithm 2\nFigure  5:  Total  energy  consumption  of  the  network  for  the\nstandard uniform grid and the new non-uniform grid. \n6. Conclusions\nIn wireless ad hoc sensor networks, energy use is in many cases the most important constraint since\nit corresponds directly to operational lifetime. Topology management such as GAF puts the nodes not\ninvolved in forwarding to sleep to save energy. The radio range will affect the number of neighbour\nnodes, which collaborate to forward data to the sink.  In this paper we have deduced the relationship\nbetween optimal radio range and traffic for a one dimensional network and find that half of the power\ncan be saved, if the radio range is adjusted, compared with the best case where equal radio ranges are\nused. This would translate into a doubling of the network lifetime. We also showed that dividing the\nnetwork into unequal grids according to the optimal range-traffic relationship can save a little more\nenergy than by using the optimal size-traffic relationship. The concept of radio range adjustment can\nclearly be applied in other topology management algorithms to save energy. \n7.
