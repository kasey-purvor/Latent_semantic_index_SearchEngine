Using \nmedium-range concepts such as \u2018social heat\u2019 and \u2018cultural intimacy\u2019 the article attempts to avoid \nthe pitfalls of totalizing approaches which explain popular gambling as consequence of or \nresistance to \u2018neoliberalism\u2019.  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n2 \n \nJust about two weeks after my arrival in Zhongba village, some young men offered to teach me \nzha jinhua. Zha jinhua \u2013 \u2018bash the golden flower\u2019 \u2013 is a card game similar to poker but with only \nthree cards for each player. The gamblers, usually half a dozen or more, take turns putting money \non the table, each betting on the combination of cards in front of him. Everyone must put in at \nleast one yuan1 as an ante, a basic amount at the beginning to enter the betting round. As in poker, \neach player has three options: to increase the highest previous bet, to match the highest previous \nbet and \u201ccall\u201d, or to give up his hand. Each game is worth an average of 50-100 yuan, and only \nlasts a couple of minutes.  \n \nI vividly remember the first evening I spent with these young men; notes of ten, fifty, and a \nhundred yuan were speedily handed over the low table. Most players placed their bills on the \ntable softly, but now and then someone would hit the table with his palm to underscore his \ndefiance of the others\u2019 bets. In the beginning I didn't understand why all the rustling heap of \nbanknotes constantly shifted from one player to the other. The action was taking place so fast that \nI couldn't keep up with the players or their bets. The ups and downs of the game were constantly \naccompanied by the jokes and swearwords of the gamblers, and commentary from the bystanders.  \n\u201cFive.\u201d \n\u201cTen.\u201d \n\u201cThat\u2019s it for me, I fold.\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019ll take this one.\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019ll do it. Double raise!\u201d \nAnd so it went on, until the next showdown, when either everyone had drawn level, or all save \none had given up their hands. Filled with cigarette smoke, the room resonated with the \nexclamations, the swearwords, and the comments of the players and the swift clapping of cards \nand banknotes. It was \u2018noisy and hot\u2019 (E. naore2), quite literally.  \n \nSitting there, I was surprised, almost shocked, at the amounts that these young men were \ngambling with \u2013 easily more than a week\u2019s income from a job in Beijing, Shanghai or Guangzhou, \nlet alone what they could earn in the odd jobs they could find locally. I thought of what I had read \n  \n \n \n3 \nbefore embarking on my fieldwork about the huge inequalities in wealth in China today, about \nneoliberal regimes and \u2018casino capitalism\u2019 (1986). Could it be that I had encountered here \nsomething akin to what the Comaroffs had called \u2018the occult economies\u2019 of \u2018millennial capitalism \nand the culture of neoliberalism\u2019 (1999; 2000)? \n \nIn the context of rural China, it seems that such an argument holds quite well: in fact most of the \nyoung people migrating to the cities to work in factories and other low-skill manual jobs are \nparticipating in a hugely unequal economy. According to official data, urban per capita incomes \nwere on average three times higher than rural incomes, and five to six times higher if the gap of \ngovernment spending on public services (health and education in particular) was taken into \naccount (UNDP 2008:33), but this does not fully reveal the realities that are so visible to most \npeople in the countryside. Both on TV and in their everyday lives in the city they are confronted \nwith glaring inequalities on a daily basis. It is in particular the young who are susceptible to \ndreams of incredible wealth, who want to \u201ctake the plunge\u201d (xiahai), leave the countryside and \nrisk a business enterprise, yet who in the majority of cases end up as wage labourers (da gong). \nHow would they explain it to themselves that some \u201cgot rich first\u201d, that some in this society are \nbuying cars and houses that they will be never able to buy in a lifetime, and that the countryside \nwhere they are from seems more and more stagnant, a place of boredom and dullness? Is not the \nmost obvious explanation simply \u201cluck\u201d or something like \u201cmagic\u201d, just what one would need in \ngambling? Is the gambling of the marginalized then not just a mirror of rising inequalities and \ndreams of easy money? A reflection of the frustrations and desires of \u2018millenial capitalism\u2019, and \nmaybe even a form of resistance against it?  \n \nSeveral authors have described contemporary Chinese society in general, and internal labour \nmigration in particular, in terms of \u2018neoliberalism\u2019 and \u2018millenial capitalism\u2019 (e.g. Yan 2003; Ngai \n2003; Lee 2006). And at least one article puts a particularly spectacular form of gambling in rural \nChina \u2013 the liuhecai underground lotteries \u2013 into the same framework (Bosco et al. 2009). But \nthis is not the direction I want to take here. Following Andrew Kipnis\u2019s recent critiques of \u2018tropes \nof neoliberalism\u2019 in China (Kipnis 2007; 2008), I argue that analysing popular gambling in rural \nChina in terms of \u2018neoliberalism\u2019 would mean positing an absolute and totalizing frame which \n  \n \n \n4 \nmisses out social action on the micro and medium range and obfuscating the interplay of local \nsociality, official discourse, and state control. \n \nAfter a short introduction about gambling in China, I will look at various forms of gambling in \nthe villages of Bashan Township3 in South-western Hubei Province, and try to delineate how they \nare inter-related with discourses of capability and fate in other areas of life. In gambling itself, \none can find certain local expressions around desired forms of sociality, which open up a \nsemantic field of vitality, heat and fire. But there are also many occasions where gambling goes \nbeyond the borders of the socially acceptable. Furthermore, the boundaries of the acceptable in \nexpressions of a vital and \u2018hot\u2019 sociality in general, and of gambling in particular, have changed \ngreatly in the last decades. The central section of this paper then deals with the different ways in \nwhich these boundaries are contested in local communities and in official ideology. In the \ndiscourses and practices of gambling, people negotiate the moving boundaries of acceptable \nsociality between young and old, between urban and rural, and between modernism and \ntraditionalism; this also implies a contestation of the boundaries between state control and market, \nand between local sociality and official representation in contemporary China.  \n \n \nGambling in China \nGambling in many different forms has a long history in China (cf. Gernet 1962:226; Wakeman \n1985:96, 625). There is even the probability that playing cards were first introduced to Europe \nfrom China (Wilkinson 1895). According to most accounts, gambling has been a part of rural life \nfor a very long time. C.F. Fitzgerald for example writes about Dali in Yunnan in the 1930s, that \nthe people there \u201care rather fond of gambling, card games being the favourite with adults, and \ndice with children\u201d (Fitzgerald 2005 [1941]:191).  \n \nWhile all gambling was forbidden during the Maoist era, since the 1980s many different forms of \ngambling and betting have become increasingly common. There are now various state sanctioned \nlotteries, of which the national sports and welfare lotteries are the biggest. Lottery sales are \n  \n \n \n5 \ngrowing rapidly, and the revenue from legal lottery sales in China was already ranked eight or \nninth largest in the world in 2006 (Schmittzehe & Partners 2006:9). The scope of illegal gambling \nand betting is even larger, with revenues up to tenfold that of legal lotteries, according to some \nestimates (ibid.:19). In recent years, the liuhecai underground lottery, for instance, has spread \nrapidly over many regions of central China (Bosco et al. 2009). In this paper, I will not deal with \nlegal or underground lotteries \u2013 none of which were common in the villages of Bashan at the time \nof fieldwork in 2007.4 Instead I focus on mahjong and various local card games which will be \ndescribed below. These forms of gambling have become the most frequent leisure activity in \nBashan in the last decades, and they are mostly condoned by local government.  \n \nThis surge of various forms of gambling \u2013 in particular the more spectacular illegal forms, such \nas the underground lotteries \u2013 invites explanation, and the context of a rapidly changing, \n\u2018neoliberal\u2019 economy seems to suggest itself. In a recent article, Bosco et al. describe in precisely \nthese terms the liuhecai underground lottery that has spread rapidly throughout most regions of \ncentral China during the last decade (Bosco et al. 2009). They first reject the argument about \n\u2018occult economies\u2019 made in other parts of the world, where people reacted to the sudden arrival of \ncommercialization and capitalism by viewing \u2018the growth of money as magical and open to \noccult manipulation\u2019 (ibid.:51). According to Bosco et al., this argument does not hold for the \ngrowth of underground lotteries in contemporary China, which has a long tradition of commerce \nand markets. In rural China, they suggest, \u2018it is not the lack of sophistication in the market \neconomy, but the accompanying frustrations and desires of consumer capitalism, and the growing \ngap in wealth, that underlies the lottery craze\u2019 (ibid.:53). At pains to find an alternative \ninterpretation for the apparent \u2018irrationality\u2019 of the underground lotteries, Bosco et al. conclude \nthat this \u2018irrationality\u2019 makes sense once seen \u2018in the context\u2019 of an economy where luck, \nspeculation, and corruption play a large role (ibid.:54). The lottery is \u2018remarkably similar\u2019 to \nspeculation, it \u2018captures the alchemy of neoliberalism: \u201cto yield wealth without production\u201d\u2019 \n(ibid.:56); in sum, the lottery is yet another example of \u2018millennial capitalism\u2019.  \n \nIt is this conclusion of an otherwise very rich ethnography with which I have problems. Bosco et \nal. yield to what Latour has called \u2018the temptation to jump to the \u201ccontext\u201d\u2019, providing the \n  \n \n \n6 \nabsolute scale of the \u2018Big Picture\u2019 or \u2018panorama\u2019 on which everything can be seen (Latour \n2005:184ff.). Various recent attempts at describing contemporary Chinese society in terms of \n\u2018neoliberalism\u2019 or \u2018millenial capitalism\u2019  (e.g. Yan 2003; Ngai 2003; Lee 2006) fall into the same \ntrap: framing their analyses in these big terms obscures broader differences between various \nforms of (neo-)liberal and anti-liberal governance, their implementation, and the ongoing political \nnegotiations of actors on the ground. By positing a social whole instead, the trope of \n\u2018neoliberalism\u2019 masks more than it reveals, as Andrew Kipnis has argued forcefully (Kipnis \n2007).5   \n \nMost ethnographies of gambling do map out some \u2018context\u2019, i.e. they provide some correlations \nand associations between gambling and the socialities in which it takes place. Several recent \nanthropological interpretations of gambling have done so, while avoiding the leap to a totalizing \npicture. Evthymios Papataxiarchis for instance has described the idioms of spendthrift behaviour \nand \u2018disinterested sociality\u2019 in gambling on Lesbos (Papataxiarchis 1999), and Thomas Malaby \nhas explored how people confront uncertainty and contingency in gambling on Crete (Malaby \n2003). Both Paptaxiarchis and Malaby argue that gambling reflects something else of the wider \nsocial context in which it takes place. Yet they are careful not to leap too many scales and not to \ngive a total panorama of Greek society.  \n \nEllen Oxfeld Basu (1991) and Paul Festa (2007) have offered analyses of gambling in Chinese \ncommunities which similarly privilege social action at the micro and medium range.6 While both \ndeal with mahjong in places far away from central China (the first in a Chinese community in \nCalcutta, and the second in Taiwan), several of the features they describe share some resemblance \nwith gambling in Bashan. \n \nEllen Oxfeld Basu starts from the apparent contradiction between the \u201centrepreneurial ethic\u201d of a \nChinese community of tanners in Calcutta and the propensity, in particular, of adult males for \nhigh-stakes gambling. In her words gambling \u201cmimics and re-enacts both the risks and possible \ngains of entrepreneurship, but it does so within an arena contained by both temporal and spatial \nrestrictions\u201d (Oxfeld Basu 1991:255). Drawing on Goffman\u2019s model of \u201cfateful action\u201d (Goffman \n  \n \n \n7 \n1967), Oxfeld Basu interprets mahjong gambling as an action that is \u201cproblematic\u201d, \n\u201cconsequential\u201d and \u201cdone for its own sake\u201d, and hence a great occasion for the display of \ncharacter; beyond that, it expresses wealth and status, and possibly \u201cthe central contradictions of \nthe community\u2019s ethos\u201d, in the sense of Geertz\u2019s \u201cdeep play\u201d (Oxfeld Basu 1991:256, quoting \nGeertz 1973). Even though there are certain similarities, the place and role of both the \n\u201centrepreneurial ethics\u201d and of gambling in rural China in 2007 differs from that of overseas \nChinese communities. Nonetheless, like Oxfeld Basu, I want to focus on the internal \ncontradiction between striving and luck\/fate that become apparent in gambling.  \n \nPaul Festa, in his analysis of mahjong gambling in Taiwan, also takes these two elements as \ndistinctive parts of the social imagery of gambling. Using the theoretical framework proposed by \nRoger Caillois (2001[1958]) for the study of play, Festa distinguishes four modes of play: agon \n(competition), alea (chance), mimesis (simulation) and ilinx (vertigo). Using Caillois\u2019s formal \ndistinctions, Festa then provides the cultural content of mahjong gambling in Taiwan. First, he \nargues that \u201cagon and alea animate dominant aspects of sociopolitical culture in Taiwan\u201d, as in \nthe \u2018martial agon\u2019 which men cultivate in politics and in the military. Festa connects the element \nof chance in gambling with certain images of the state, where both personal and national \naspirations are linked together, as in the official lotteries, or in the astounding ways in which the \nstate is also seen as an element of \u201cfate\u201d in individuals\u2019 lives. The third element of mimesis is a \n\u201cmartial imaginary\u201d that appears strikingly with his informants, who all took part in compulsory \nmilitary service in Taiwan. The militarization of the island of course has a lot to do with the \ncross-straits conflict and the perceived threat of the PRC. The mainland also shares a history of \nmilitarization that is, however, different in many respects: perhaps most importantly, there is no \ncompulsory military service, and for most men in Bashan, bodily movements at the mahjong \ntable would barely remind them of military drill. Festa concludes his article suggesting that there \nare elements of vertigo and possession (ilinx) in mahjong, which might contain possibilities of a \n\u2018sympathetic agonism\u2019 that is \u2018internalized and generalized\u2019 by \u2018mahjong mimesis\u2019. Such a \n\u2018sympathetic agonism\u2019 might in the end partake \u2018in the production of a public space marked by \ndemocratic plurality, progress, and change\u2019 (2007:117). That mahjong could mimic a \n\u2018sympathetic agonism\u2019 of democratic plurality in Taiwan seems a bold speculation to me. But be \n  \n \n \n8 \nthat as it may, the agonies of democratic development are surely very different across the Taiwan \nStrait. \n \nAs Festa argues, gambling animates certain \u2018imaginaries\u2019 intimately linked to the state. Yet these \nimaginaries are locally specific in Bashan, and they are linked to the state in different ways from \nthose Festa may have observed in Taiwan. Before coming back to what might be \u2018simulated\u2019 or \n\u2018mimicked\u2019 in ordinary gambling in Bashan, let us have a look at what is concretely produced in \ngambling, according to local folk theory: social heat. \n \nThe Ambiguities of Social Heat \nIn Bashan any notable social event should be \u2018noisy and hot\u2019 (E. naore, P. renao or honghuo). \nThe liveliness, noise, and heat implied in the word naore is the ideal characteristic of a festival, a \nbanquet, a market, and of gambling. Houses that are high up in the mountains and far away from \nroads are said to be \u2018lonely\u2019 and \u2018cold\u2019 in the vernacular. Contrasted to this is the \u2018liveliness\u2019 and \n\u2018hotness\u2019 of the street and the market. This is related to the cultural ideal of having a household \nthat is \u2018lively and hot\u2019 of which the most obvious sign would be many children crowded under \none roof.7 Coming together for any eventful gathering \u2013 temple fairs, banquets, or gambling for \ninstance \u2013 produces social heat and \u2018red-hot\u2019 exuberance according to a kind of \u2018sociothermic \ntheory of sociality\u2019 as Adam Chau has called it. Using examples such as men\u2019s drinking games \nand temple fairs, he has described this field of social heat as \u2018red-hot sociality\u2019 and a Chinese \nkind of \u2018folk event production\u2019 (Chau 2006: chapter 8; see also Chau 2008). Yet this kind of \u2018red-\nhot sociality\u2019 is not unequivocally evaluated positively: temple fairs had been prohibited for long \ntimes as feudal superstition and, for many urbanites, the drinking games which Chau cites as \nexamples of the production of \u2018red-hot sociality\u2019 (Chau 2008:493-94) are signs of coarse and \nuncivilized peasantness. The negotiation around the social heat produced in gambling and how it \nis evaluated differently by different actors is thus precisely the focus of this article.  \n \nIn the case of gambling, the ambivalence of social heat parallels the general distinction between \n\u2018social gambling\u2019 and \u2018problem gambling\u2019. In Chinese, this opposition is matched closely by the \n  \n \n \n9 \ntwo words that are most commonly used for \u2018gambling\u2019: wan and du. The first is more \nentertainment and play, whereas the second clearly denotes the involvement of money and betting. \nAs Pina-Cabral and Chan illustrate in their analysis of gambling in Macao, the decision whether a \ncertain game is better described as one or the other is certainly a question of perspective \u2013 \nfrequently the gamblers themselves will prefer to speak of wan (Pina-Cabral 2002:82ff). This \nwan side of gambling is also extremely important for the celebration of kinship, of friendship, \neven of relatedness in general. To \u2018play\u2019 (wan) together is the best way to cement a relationship. \nWan can involve gambling, but also many other social activities, such as playing games of any \nkind, eating, making an excursion, chatting, joking, etc. The social exchanges in these activities \nideally should be lively, hot, and noisy (E. naore), in short, they should produce \u2018social heat\u2019. It is \nthe other side of gambling \u2013 du \u2013 that is purely associated with betting and money. High-stakes \ncard games played by young men such as the one mentioned at the beginning of this article are \nalmost unequivocally called \u201cgambling\u201d (du). There are other games, in particular the pastimes of \nelders, which will be just as unequivocally called wan. But perhaps the larger part of these \npractices lies in between those two extremes, and there is a lot of ironic playing with the \npositioning of these forms of gambling with respect to what is socially acceptable and what not.   \n \nZha jinhua, the game mentioned at the beginning, is in fact not the most common one in Bashan, \nand it is reserved generally for young men.  The games most frequently played in the villages of \nBashan are mahjong and two card games: dou dizhu (\u201cstruggle against the landlord\u201d) and shaofo \n(P. shaohu, \u201cpull and win\u201d). These games are played in the most diverse occasions, during \nweddings, funerals, and other family celebration; and very often on rainy days at home. During \nthe \u2018idle\u2019 period of the peasant calendar (nongxian), and in particular at the time of the Spring \nFestival, many people will gamble all day with their families, or with relatives and neighbours. \nThe period of the Spring Festival is a time of permissiveness, of amusement in the home amongst \nrelatives and close friends that more often than not takes the form of gambling.8 Such forms of \ngambling will be unequivocally called \u2018wan\u2019 \u2013 which is more the \u2018play\u2019 side of gambling. \nSimilarly encouraged, if to a somewhat lesser extent, is the gambling at family celebrations like \nweddings, funerals and house inaugurations.  \n \n  \n \n \n10 \nSetting up a gambling table and providing guests with a set of mahjong tiles or playing cards \nbelongs to the proper ways of hosting a guest, together with offering cigarettes and a meal. This \nis particularly relevant for families of higher social standing, where guests are frequent and \nhosting is a sign of distinction; gambling equipment is a necessary household asset in such \nfamilies. Guests can include friends, business partners and officials; and to entertain guests \nspending some time together in \u201camusement\u201d and \u201cplay\u201d (wan) is the best \u2013 and often necessary \n\u2013 way to establish and maintain good relationships. Before exploring the intricacies of gambling \nfurther, it is necessary to make explicit the images of fate and luck that are very often associated \nwith such families as they play an important role in the social idiom in which gambling is viewed \nand evaluated.  \n \nFate and Fire \nIn an article on Chinese notions of happiness and self-fulfilment, Wang Mingming (1997 [1986]) \ndemonstrates how people in villages in Southern Fujian judge achievement and failure with the \noppositional pair of capability (nengli) and life\/fate (ming). Ming most basically means one\u2019s life, \nbut it also connotes someone\u2019s fate.9 Wang delineates this opposition as a local \u2018social ontology\u2019 \n(shehui bentilun), structurally similar to the opposition of \u2018structure\u2019 and \u2018agency\u2019 in the social \nsciences. The metaphorical relationship between \u2018capability\u2019 (nengli) and \u2018fate\u2019 (ming) can be \nparalleled in life histories, and also in the discourses on and the practice of gambling in rural \nChina. When asked about their life stories, and in particular, the reasons for success or failure in \ntheir lives, many people in Bashan would end either with stressing their capabilities (nengli or \nbenshi), or bluntly relating it to their good \u2018fate\u2019 (ming). Every time I insisted on this point, trying \nto force a decision on either of both, people would admit that it is in fact both elements, and the \nrelationship between them can never be finally determined.  \n \nBeyond that, it is also difficult to claim at any point in time that someone\u2019s life has been happy \nand successful. The criteria for happiness were traditionally sons, wealth, and long life, but sons \ncan become prodigal, wealth can invite jealousy, and old people can fall ill. Moreover, these \n  \n \n \n11 \ntraditional criteria have become highly ambiguous in recent decades, most obviously the \naspiration for many sons. Family planning is strictly enforced in Bashan, and government \npropaganda continuously repeats that \u2018girls are just as good as boys\u2019. The pursuit of material \nwealth was strongly condemned under Maoism, and though it is now again fully legitimized, to \nbecome a marker of happiness and success wealth also needs to be continuously exchanged in \nproper ways. Regarding all these measurements of \u2018happiness\u2019, it is crucially important to \ndemonstrate one\u2019s success to others at appropriate times and in appropriate ways. This display of \nhappiness and success invariably includes conspicuous consumption and the production of \u2018social \nheat\u2019, as for instance in banquets and family celebrations. Hence to be able to produce social heat \nis constitutive of living in a socially meaningful way, and showing one\u2019s life-fate (ming) to others \n\u2013 and perhaps constitutive of having a life-fate (ming) at all.10   \n \nIn this sense, it is not coincidental that the word for \u2018luck\u2019 that is commonly used in Bashan \u2013 \nhuoqi \u2013 is also related to warmth and fire. In a standard Mandarin dictionary huoqi means \u201canger, \ntemper; heat in human body; cold-resistant capacity; internal heat\u201d, but in the local dialect it is \ngenerally used in the sense of luck (P. yunqi). Another very similar word can also be used as an \nattribute signifying luck and good fate: huose. This is explained by locals as similar to saying that \nsomeone\u2019s \u2018flame\u2019 (P. huoyan) is \u2018high\u2019. There are at least two senses to this word. One is \nspiritual, meaning that one\u2019s \u2018life-force\u2019 is strong; thus, one could say that ghosts will not attack \nsomeone whose huose is good, because they would fear him, whereas they would attack someone \nwhose huose is not good. The other sense, which is much more commonly used by young people, \nmeans basically that someone is capable, tough, and impressive.11 \n \nThis semantic field of heat, vitality and success stretches from the proper warmth of a social \noccasion (E. naore), to luck (E. huoqi and huose), and can be also extended to how a business \nshould be: like fire (huo). Saying that a business goes like \u201cfire\u201d (huo) means that it is going \nexceptionally well. And, this relationship is certainly not only semantic: people who are \nsuccessful in business will have many reciprocal relationships (laiwang), to be seen in the fact \nthat they frequently receive guests and partake in the \u201cheat\u201d of celebrations, of commensality, and \nof amusement (wan), which in turn often means gambling together.  \n  \n \n \n12 \n \nCommensality in hosting a guest also reveals in particular ways the verticality and horizontality \nof the relationships between the people at the table: there will be a clear positioning of the seats at \nthe table according to criteria of age, rank, and power. Inferiors, sitting on the \u201clower seats\u201d \n(xiawei), will invite those at the \u201chigher seats\u201d (shangwei) to drink. (The \u2018lower seats\u2019 are \ngenerally closer to the doors and the \u2018higher seats\u2019 opposite the door, where the ancestral shrines \nwere placed in farm houses.) An important guest will invariably sit at such a higher seat. In these \ntoasts, one can clearly see an expression of homage on the one side (the inferior invites the \nsuperior), and of reciprocity on the other (both drink exactly the same amount).12 Just as when \ninviting someone to eat and to drink, there is a particular emphasis on formality and equal \nparticipation in gambling. Gambling means placing one\u2019s luck in the hands of that ruthless \narbitrator, the mahjong tiles or the cards. Everyone sticks to the rules, and there is an elaborate \nethics of proper behaviour and of paying one\u2019s gambling debts. But just as with commensality, \nhierarchical relationships are plainly visible in gambling. During gambling, the powerful and rich \ngenerally end up showing that the \u201cfire\u201d (E. huose) of their life is higher \u2013 by demonstrating \nindifference to the loss of huge sums, or by winning. Often the inferiors will let them win to \nmake the superior feel good, a form of indirect \u201cgift\u201d to them. If the social distance between the \nsuperior and the others is too great, the superior can also simply refuse an invitation to gamble, \nblocking the occasion for reciprocity and mutual indulgence in social heat all together.  \n \nThis element of \u201cfire\u201d is parallel to what is called yun in the standard Chinese expression for \n\u201cluck\u201d (P. yunqi). Both categories are more susceptible to human influence than is ming, which is \n\u201cfate\u201d, but also just simply \u201clife\u201d. Fire-like luck (P. yunqi, E. huoqi) stands more for the everyday \ncontingency, which can be manipulated by everyday means. It can be seen within gambling, and \nimmediately so, after every round. Ming (fate\/life), however, has to do with the outside limits of \ngambling, and its place in the wider social environment. One\u2019s ming will not be changed in one \nround of gambling, but it is still visible in the way one participates \u2013 or does not \u2013 in gambling \nrounds. Through participation in gambling, people show that they are ready to take risks; in \nparticular they take the risk of losing money at high stakes. The higher the stakes, the higher is \nthe possible prestige of the person who loses it. The propriety of such behaviour, in particular of \n  \n \n \n13 \nthe powerful, is much talked about. And so are the boundaries of gambling, of that which goes \nbeyond what is socially expected as \u201centertainment\u201d and mutual amusement (wan) in social \n\u201cheat\u201d and becomes unsocial gambling (du).  \n \nThe Boundaries of Gambling  \nBoundaries of Gambling I:  in Local Sociality \nThe contrary evaluation of the willingness to take high risks is crucial for the boundaries of \nsocially accepted gambling in local sociality. If participation in gambling shows that one\u2019s ming \nis really powerful, this is even more so the case if the stakes are high, and the respective games \nare \u2018based entirely on luck\u2019 (wanquan shi huoqi), as people sometimes said about mahjong and \nthe local card games dou dizhu and shaofo. When asked directly, most gamblers would say that in \nthese games the ratio of luck and capability is about 80% to 20%.13 But while some people \n(especially young men) would interpret this high risk as a display of strength and character, \nothers (especially older people) would condemn it as irrational and immoral.  \n \nAt least sometimes the risk taking of the young seemed to be excused as youthful folly, or even \npositively acknowledged as manly bravery.14 Several middle-aged men told me that they did not \ngamble much today but that when they were young, they were tremendous gamblers. So did one \nman in his thirties, when we were leaving the house where some neighbours had been gambling \nfor about ten days in a row during the \u201cidle months\u201d (nongxian) of the peasant calendar. On the \nway home he burst out \u201cmahjong, mahjong, mahjong; all the time mahjong. It is so boring and \nuseless.\u201d I asked him why then he gambled at all, if it was just boring? He answered that there is \njust nothing else to do. \u201cAnyway, it\u2019s just fun (hao wan), there are no big stakes in there.\u201d When \nhe was young, he went on, he gambled much more. And he would not lose tens or hundreds of \nyuan, like now, but tens of thousands of yuan in just one night. In this way, men often played \ndown their gambling now as mere \u201centertainment\u201d (wan), but still insisted that they had \nexperience with much riskier and hazardous gambling when they were young.  \n  \n \n \n14 \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \nContrary to this acknowledgment of risk taking in high-stakes gambling, many others condemned \nthe gambling attitudes of the young and described the belief that through gambling one could \nshow daring strength and power as erroneous and misguided.  If gamblers failed to fulfil social \nexpectations, in particular earning enough money to marry, they will face fierce criticism, both \nfrom their family and from outsiders. Even worse would be the case of a married man who \ngambled away all of his family\u2019s wealth. Such examples were often referred to as people who had \na bad \u2018fate\u2019 (ming), and so were their parents, who might have been hard-working people. \n \nA case in point in Zhongba was Hu Yanglong. His father Hu Xungao had been extremely hard \nworking, to the extent that the neighbours would often call him a \u201cmodel worker\u201d (laodong \nmofang). He had never been officially awarded this honorific title, however; to the contrary, \nduring the Maoist era, he had been classed as a \u201crich peasant\u201d and hence had suffered a lot in \n\u201cstruggle sessions\u201d and everyday humiliation. Against many odds, and with a lot of hard work, he \nhad built a huge tea factory in the 1980s. One of the first major tea factories in Zhongba when \nthere was less competition on the tea market, it yielded substantial profit for the family. Far from \nretiring, the model worker started several other enterprises, toiling day and night. He was one of \nthe first to grow his own tea shoots, and he also had a minor construction business. When there \nwas nothing else to do, he made chairs and tables at home, as he was also a skilled carpenter and \njoiner. At the time of Hu Yanglong\u2019s marriage, his father was building a huge new house for his \nson on the market street of Bashan, on land belonging to Hu Yanglong\u2019s father-in-law. This \nmarriage was considered an extremely good match, the father-in-law providing wealth and \nbuilding lots on the market place and Hu Xungao building two houses, one of which they sold \nlater to build the next tea factory.  \n \nHu Yanglong was the youngest son of three; his two older brothers got the tea factory at home \nand the house, whereas he inherited the house on the market street. With that, he was clearly the \nmost favoured one, a rather common pattern locally for the youngest son. His father had from \nearly on demanded too much of the other sons, and the oldest son had left the area some fifteen \nyears before to work in another province, while the second son had had several major fights with \n  \n \n \n15 \nhis own father. Being the most favoured and youngest son, Hu Yanglong had never worked much \nin his life. He got involved in some small tea business but preferred spending his time gambling \nmahjong and visiting brothels.  \n \nSoon after I had made his acquaintance, the village officials told me not to spend time with him: \n\u2018This guy is up to no good\u2019, they said. Yet some young men would also speak in awe of his \nexploits at the gambling table, and tell stories about him and his companions. In 2007, after \nseveral fights with his wife related to gambling debts, he divorced her, and the family had to sell \nthe house on the market. In local gossip he was then mostly described as a \u201cspendthrift\u201d and \n\u201cprodigal son\u201d (baijiazi), and not even the young men who had respected him before found many \ngood words for him. It was clear that he had transgressed the boundaries of what was acceptable. \nThe risks he had taken had been too high, and instead of displaying a mighty ming, he had shown \nnot only that he had no \u2018luck\u2019, but also that his ming was bad.  \n \nThis kind of condemnation by talk and gossip in the village community is well-documented in \nthe literature on rural China. 15  Citing cases like Hu Yanglong\u2019s, older people frequently \ncomplained about the morals of the day. Similar to corruption and prostitution, such gambling \nwas a kind of social heat which had became debauched and destructive. In comments such as this \ngambling was often linked with exploitation16 and speculation17 into a morality tale of social \ndecline.  \n \nLet me now introduce a form of gambling which stands at the opposite of high-stakes mahjong in \nall aspects: a local card game, played mostly by old men, and unequivocally accepted as pastime \nand entertainment (wan).  \n \nThe shaofo game \nMahjong is probably the most common form of gambling in the Chinese world, and is sometimes \nironically called a distinctive trait of Chinese civilisation. In Bashan, another form of gambling \nstands in just such an ironic relation to local belonging and tradition: a card game called shaofo \n  \n \n \n16 \nor changpai. In various forms, this game can be found in many areas of central and south-western \nChina, but each locality has its own rules and its own sets of cards. In Bashan the game consists \nof four sets of 24 long cards with one Chinese character painted in calligraphy on each of them.  \n \nThe calligraphy is rather intricate, and so at first it was impossible for me to decipher it. When I \nasked for the meaning of the characters on the cards, a twenty-year-old told me that it is \u2018Kong \nYiji, you know, the Kong Yiji of Lu Xun\u2019. That did not help me either, until an old man pointed \nout to me that this is the story of \u2018Kong the second brother (Kong Lao\u2019er). You know, in China \nwe have Kong the second.\u2019 And then he told me legends about this man Kong. It began to dawn \non me that this must be Kongzi, i.e. Confucius.   \n \nThe 24 characters form eight verses of three characters each, and make up a poem:  \n \nshang da ren His Greatness \nqiu yi ji Confucius \nhua san qian has taught three thousand students \nqi shi xian of which seventy became virtuous scholars. \ner xiao sheng A young student like you \nba jiu zi should study from eight or nine sages  \njia zuo ren should learn how to be benevolent  \nke zhi li and hence understand courtesy and manners. \n \nThe rules of the game are similar to mahjong; people pull cards from the stock in turn, and the \none who first reaches a full combination of all his cards in families of three, or sets of three or \nfour of the same card, wins. \n \nWhat is remarkable about shaofo, however, is the social confinement within which it takes place: \nit is exclusively elder men who play the game, and it is played mostly on occasions where it \nclearly does not conflict with other demands. The accusation of wasting time instead of doing \n  \n \n \n17 \nproductive work almost never appears here; people play shaofo only on the right occasions, that \nis, on rainy days when there is not much to do anyway, when visiting relatives or on holidays.  \n \nFurthermore, as if the ideals of Confucian ethics and propriety written on the playing cards \ndemanded it, this game almost never takes place with very high stakes, nor is it played all night. \nIt is primarily a pastime for elder men. This stands in stark contrast with high-stakes mahjong, \nplayed by the likes of Hu Yanglong. Whilst the latter is generally judged as \u201cgambling\u201d (du), \nshaofo obviously remains within the accepted boundaries of play and amusement (wan). Yet \nshaofo carries with it another kind of ambiguity, which is the ambiguity of a traditionalism which \nis an essential part of local sociality and at the same time a source of lingering embarrassment \nvis-\u00e0-vis outsiders and the modernist state discourse. \n \nBoundaries of Gambling II:  Cultural Intimacy and the State \nThe cards of the shaofo game, and the poem about Confucius on them, stand in an ambivalent \nrelationship to dominant and official orthodoxy. On the one hand, they stand for uprightness and \nconformity, invoking solemn verses and ideals, and the social confinement of gambling. But they \nalso represent parody of the archaism of the classical language of Confucian ethics \u2013 and of \nsentences that have been repeated countless times, and mostly only half understood.  \n \nThe verses on the shaofo game were commonly used in late imperial China to teach reading and \nwriting to boys, who had to copy the characters written with brushstrokes, and memorize the \nverse. By doing so, sons were supposed also to learn the good ways of \u2018benevolence\u2019 (ren) and \n\u2018propriety\u2019 (li). The stories that old men still tell about \u201cKong the second\u201d and his deeds fulfil a \nsimilar purpose: they generally have a clear moral which is invariably phrased in the Confucian \nidiom of filial piety (xiao), loyalty (zhong), benevolence (ren), and propriety (li).  \n \nWhat the young man first told me when I asked after the meaning of the characters on the cards is \nnonetheless intriguing: he simply referred to the \u201cKong Yiji of Lu Xun\u201d, and gave no further \nexplanation. The short story \u201cConfucius\u201d (Kong Yiji) by Lu Xun belongs to the canon of required \n  \n \n \n18 \nreading that any middle school student in the People\u2019s Republic has to study. In the short story a \nbedraggled Confucian scholar is mockingly called by the nickname \u201cConfucius\u201d (Kong Yiji). \nKong Yiji speaks the arcane language (zhi hu zhe ye) of the scholar-officials, but he is \nimpoverished and known as a thief and a drunkard. The narrator describes him at the inn, where \nhe usually gets drunk, whilst the other guests are poking fun at him. Written in 1918, the short \nstory is a parody on the anachronism and emptiness of the classical language of Confucian ethics, \nand with it of traditional China in its totality.18  \n \nThis short story became a core text of the radical critique of the Confucian tradition from the May \nFourth Movement in 1919 onwards. Its radical turn against tradition was rather limited to urban \nintellectuals during the first decades of the 20th century. Yet over the course of the century, the \nextraordinarily forceful rejection of tradition would become hegemonic discourse in China. \nSlogans such as \u201cDestroy the Shop of Confucius\u201d (dadao kongjia dian) and put \u201cScience and \nDemocracy\u201d (kexue yu minzhu) in its place were taken over by the Chinese Communist Party. \nDuring the Maoist era, similar slogans including the rejection of the Confucian tradition were \ntaught in school and endlessly repeated in \u201cclass struggle sessions\u201d, over radios, loudspeakers, \nand on wall newspapers (dazibao).  \n \nEven though much has changed regarding the public evaluation of Confucianism, the memory of \nthis past still renders elements of popular Confucianism into a lingering source of embarrassment. \nLet me quote now a description of shaofo that reflects a sense of embarrassment about the \nConfucian ethics of propriety, or li. The following is a blog entry on the internet written by a \nyoung man from the provincial capital Wuhan, probably an employee or government official, \nmusing on shaofo:  \n \nIn the evening some old people sat down next to the road in the shadow of the trees \nand played a card game together. [He went closer, and discovered, to his surprise, that \nthe poem of \u201cHis Greatness Confucius\u201d was written on the cards.] These 24 characters \noriginally had been the \u201ctextbooks\u201d used in feudal society to teach writing and educate \nchildren. [\u2026] Confucius had been the patron saint for which every feudal dynasty \n  \n \n \n19 \n(fengjian wangchao) since the Han was beating the drums; obviously these 24 \ncharacters refer to Confucius and the basics of his thought, and they are imbued with \nfeudal ritual and rules (fengjian lifa). But the fact that the vast masses of working \npeople made this poem into a card game for entertainment is really quite interesting. \nWho says that the rules and etiquette of Confucius chagrined the working people? \nYour emperor treated it as the highest doctrine, and used it as a \u201ctextbook\u201d to \ntyrannize students, you say? As for me, I play with this form, play with it in the same \nway I would play mahjong \u2013 what do you want to do about that? \n[\u2026]  \nThis is just a card game, why think so much?  \n(Guangming Shibei 2007) \n \nIt should be noted that this was written in 2007; the modernist condemnation of the Confucian \ndoctrine still had its grip on the mind of at least this blogger. This provides quite a glaring \ncontrast to the re-appropriation of Confucianism by the government and mainstream media that \nwas taking place at the same time in the cities and via academic circles. In recent years, the \nChinese government has installed Confucius Institutes all over the world, and the study of the \nConfucian classics is a declared priority. TV shows in which university professors discuss the \nworks of Confucius, Mencius, and other classics of Chinese philosophy, history, and literature, \nare hugely popular. The most popular of these is \u201cLecture Room\u201d (baijia jiangtan), a programme \nwhere intellectuals discuss the classics and relate them to issues of contemporary everyday life. \nThe most successful TV Confucians are Yu Dan and Yi Zhongtian. Their books, in particular Yu \nDan\u2019s comments on the Confucian Analects (Yu 2006), became huge bestsellers over the last \ncouple of years. Actually one of my neighbours in Zhongba, a farmer and retired village official, \nalso read one of Yi Zhongtian\u2019s books in the evenings after working in the fields. This all goes to \nshow that the modernist denial of the Confucian tradition has long ceased to be hegemonic. In \nfact, for many urban Chinese the kind of Cultural-Revolution style condemnation of \nConfucianism has become an embarrassment, a show of uncivilized peasant despotism.  \n \n  \n \n \n20 \nAs the Confucian morals represented by the characters on the shaofo cards have become highly \nambiguous, so have the Confucian morals represented by the rounds in which shaofo is actually \nplayed. It is in these rounds that the strongest judgements about the lack of morality of the young \ncan be heard. But for many of the young, the rounds and card games of the old men represent \nvillage-level gossip and peasant narrow-mindedness, exactly those things that have to be left \nbehind if one enters \u2018the big world\u2019 (da shijie) of the cities. Recalling the ambiguities of popular \nConfucianism and potentially representing peasant backwardness, these games are also \nsomething that is not strictly encouraged by officialdom. It is rather something that is tacitly \npermitted \u2013 but definitely not publicly displayed.19 After all, shaofo itself is also a form of \ngambling.  \n \nShaofo is also barely ever mentioned in the local media. The intricate ambiguities that come with \nit are more muted, especially when compared with high-stakes card games and mahjong. Every \nnow and then, high-stakes gambling is loudly condemned in the newspapers and on TV, and \nregularly, there are reports about businessmen and officials who were punished for taking part in \ngambling.20 In a similar vein, high-stakes gambling is often portrayed in the newspapers as the \npastime of thugs and shady elements in society. 21  In newspaper articles and political \nannouncements, \u2018gambling\u2019 (dubo) is not presented as the flip side of economic development, but \nas residual of \u2018backward\u2019 (luohou) peasant culture, in the same category as lack of hygiene and \n\u2018feudal superstition\u2019 (fengjian mixin).22  \n \nThe irony here is that it is precisely those who try hardest not to be peasants, that is, migrant \nworkers, rural businessmen and officials, who are the focus of such attacks. They themselves \nalways describe their actions as harmless \u201centertainment\u201d (wan), and yet the \u201cfire-like\u201d sociality \nthat is created in such entertainment is something that is frowned upon by the authorities. \nOfficials in particular are the targets of regular government campaigns against gambling. \nHowever, as everybody knows but no one can quite say publicly, there are good social reasons for \nthe fact that local officials are very often heavy gamblers. Besides individual propensities and the \nboredom of a life in the civil service, there is another reason for the frequency of gambling \namongst officials: it serves the function of establishing tight relationships to superiors, to peers \n  \n \n \n21 \nand to business partners, in the celebration of lively, vital and \u201chot\u201d sociality. Tight relationships \nwelded by social heat, however, are often necessary to be an effective official or businessman. \n \nOfficials, the businessmen who collaborate with them, and the migrant workers who aspire to \nbecome businessmen, all have to engage with the moving boundaries of socially acceptable \ngambling on an everyday basis. The official discourse of newspapers and TV is not yet very \nsophisticated here: gambling is either not mentioned at all, or strongly condemned. But elsewhere \nin China, gambling \u2013 mahjong at least \u2013 has already become the object of a normalizing discourse \nrelated to the government\u2019s aim to create frameworks of \u201ccivilized\u201d leisure activities. \n \nSo argues Paul Festa, for instance: with the example of a governmental and academic discourse \non mahjong, he exemplifies a normalizing framework and a \u2018moral regulation\u2019 of the emerging \nmass consumer culture in the People\u2019s Republic of China (Festa 2006). Dealing primarily with \nconsumption, these discourses also elaborate on notions of civility and national belonging. \nFesta\u2019s examples for these \u2018mahjong politics\u2019 are exclusively textual, mainly focusing on one \ntreatise entitled \u201cThe Study of Mahjong\u201d (majiangxue) by Sheng Qi, which suggests an academic \ninvestigation on mahjong, and gives recommendations for \u2018healthy mahjong\u2019 (jiankang majiang) \nthat would be a proper expression of Chinese culture, against degraded \u201cpopular mahjong\u201d which \nis simplified and mostly involves betting.23 Predictably, Festa concludes that there are countless \ncontestations around this discursive construction. He observes \u2018that popular mahjong and the \ngambling that accompanies it are alive and well\u2019 (2006:26), and that there is an \u2018official \nambivalence over whether or not to promote healthy mahjong\u2019, which, however, \u2018merely \nunderscores the party-state\u2019s unequivocal antipathy for popular mahjong, ensuring that playing \nmahjong in contemporary China will remain at once a personal and political act\u2019 (Festa 2006:28).  \n \nIn the countryside of Enshi, there is not (yet?) such a sophisticated \u2018moral regulation\u2019 of mahjong; \nthe promotion of \u201chealthy mahjong\u201d is unheard of here. In the official and government discourses \nin Bashan, there is simply no positive evaluation of gambling that would point towards the \nnormalizing moral framework Festa describes. This might arrive soon, but so far, gambling is \neither tacitly condoned (as is shaofo, mostly), or publicly denounced as corrupt practice.  \n  \n \n \n22 \n \nAs a practice that is both crucially important for local sociality and a potential source of external \nembarrassment, these forms of gambling are expressions of cultural intimacy in Michael \nHerzfeld\u2019s sense (2005). This sense of intimacy arises from the tension between a modernist \noutside representation (where gambling is continuously condemned) and the continuation of local \npractices, which partly contradict the former. Towards an outsider (an urbanite, a government \nofficial, or an anthropologist), people refer to something like shaofo with characteristic gestures \nof irony or embarrassment: such a game is presented as a curiosity, an oddity, and potentially a \ntroublesome relict of peasant traditionalism.  \n \nThe card games of the old men do not represent anything nearly as dangerous and unruly as the \ngames of the young. Yet in another way, the high-stakes games of the young, of officials, \nbusinessmen, and migrant workers, also reproduce vital and hot sociality \u2013 a sociality that is the \nmore intimate because it is frequently deplored in official discourse. The conflict between this \nlocal form of sociality and the ideological representation of gambling as a social pathology has to \nbe confronted continuously. In the everyday practice of \u2018social poetics\u2019 (Herzfeld 2005), people \ncreatively bring together outside representations and inside knowledge, and negotiate the moving \nboundaries of socially acceptable heat.  \n \n \nConclusion \nI started this article with the hunch about \u2018occult economies\u2019 and \u2018millenial capitalism\u2019 which \noccurred to me when I was watching young men gambling in Bashan. Admittedly, most of the \nother forms of gambling that I have described here are clearly less spectacular. But even for the \nhigh-stakes gambling of young men an explanation in terms of \u2018neoliberalism\u2019 would overlook \nthe everyday contention of the boundaries of social heat which I have described here.  \n \nOver time I had to realize that there were many aspects to the different forms of gambling \ncommon in Bashan which a description in such terms would miss. If the analyst imposes an \n  \n \n \n23 \nabsolute and objectivist interpretative framework such as \u2018neoliberalism\u2019 or \u2018millenial capitalism\u2019, \nsocial action at the micro and medium range (which is captured here in the concepts of \u2018social \nheat\u2019 and \u2018cultural intimacy\u2019) either gets completely lost from view or becomes a mere after-\nproduct of the posited whole. Instead of locating gambling in contemporary rural China \nsomewhere inside the \u2018bigger picture\u2019 of \u2018neoliberalism\u2019 or \u2018millennial capitalism\u2019, I have \nsuggested here that through the local idiom and practice of \u2018social heat\u2019 it could be understood \nbetter as a changing way of socializing and of displaying social success. Additionally, it \nepitomizes the contradictions between old and young, rural and urban, and local sociality and \nofficial\/state discourse.  \n \nIn this article I have described how local notions of capability, luck and fate relate to a kind of \n\u2018social heat\u2019 that is characterized by a certain ambiguity: while expected and necessary \nsometimes, it can also turn into deplored anti-social indulgence. From there I traced the \nboundaries of acceptable forms of \u201centertainment\u201d (wan) against that which should be \ncondemned as \u201cgambling\u201d (du), both in local sociality and vis-\u00e0-vis the local state. But the ways \nthe boundaries of socially acceptable gambling are drawn in local sociality and in official \ndiscourse are partly contradictory. Official discourse largely condemns gambling as backward \n\u2018peasant\u2019 activity, and extends its blanket condemnation to forms of gambling which are essential \nto local sociality (for which shaofo was a prime example). Yet on the other hand, official \ndiscourse misdescribes the high-stakes gambling which is popular precisely among those who try \nto be hardest not to be peasants, but assertively modern (local politicians, businessmen, and \nmigrant workers).  \n \nOlder people, when asked about the morals of the time, frequently named gambling, prostitution, \nand the lack of filial piety as the signs of the decline of public morality. As regards gambling, it \nseems to me that this does not refer to gambling per se \u2013 which has long existed in China \u2013 but to \nthe fact that gambling nowadays is increasingly expanding outside the confines within which it \nwas socially acceptable and even expected. The production of \u2018social heat\u2019 \u2013 the liveliness and \nwarmth that is good and proper on the one hand, but can turn over into corruption and chaos on \nthe other \u2013 is crucial to both the accepted norms of old, and to what belongs to market \n  \n \n \n24 \nrelationships now. The discourses and practices of gambling epitomize the moving boundaries of \nthis social heat, and with them the boundaries of the socially acceptable within local sociality, and \nthe outside boundaries of local sociality itself.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n25 \nReferences  \n Bosco, J., L.H.-M.

The exchange rate in 2006 and 2007 was approximately \n1 yuan to \u00a30.07 (\u20ac0.11). \n2 Throughout the text, Chinese words are written italicized in the standard pinyin form. Words in the Enshi dialect \nthat differ markedly in pronunciation and meaning from standard Mandarin Chinese I have marked with an \u201cE\u201d. All \nother Chinese words in italics are part of the vocabulary of standard Mandarin, and only marked with a \u201cP\u201d (for \nputonghua, i.e. standard Mandarin Chinese) if it was necessary to distinguish them from the Enshi dialect (e.g. \n\u201cstreet\u201d is \u201cE. gai\u201d and \u201cP. jie\u201d). \n3 All names of persons and of places below the prefectural level are pseudonyms. \n4 The welfare and sports lotteries are generally limited to urban regions and more common with people who have \nmiddle or high income; cf. Zeng and Zhang (2007) for a profile of lottery players in the city of Guangzhou. In \nBashan there existed one lottery station in 2007, which was generally frequented by older men from the township. I \nhave never seen anyone from the surrounding villages buy a lottery ticket there. The liuhecai underground lottery \nwas very common in the Yangzi plains of Hubei in 2007, but had not yet arrived in the mountains of this region.  \n5 A related problem is whether the society and economy of contemporary China is \u2018neoliberal\u2019 at all. Referring to its \noligarchic corporatist state and party, the strengthening of personalist ties, and the persistence of highly un-\negalitarian hierarchies, Kipnis (2008) and Nonini (2008) argue against using \u2018neoliberalism\u2019 to describe \ncontemporary China.  \n6 Many ethnographies mention the topic in passing (e.g. Kulp 1925:325-326; Hsu 1948:26,65; Watson 1975:168), but \nto my knowledge Oxfeld (1991), Festa (2007), and Bosco et al. (2009) are the only texts providing focused \nanthropological analyses of Chinese gambling. \n7 Since family planning has been enforced in the 1980s, most families have only one or two children.  \n8 \u201cBoth the New Year season and the Autumn Festival are times of increased licence. Gambling is sanctioned by \ncustom if not by law.\u201d (Feuchtwang 2001:104). \n9 Harrell has described the dilemmas of fate (ming) as a Chinese folk theory (Harrell 1987). For a general overview \nover different concepts of ming throughout Chinese history, see Brokaw (1991) and the contributions to Lupke \n(2005).   \n10 Adam Chao imagines that in contrast to the Cartesian cogito,  \u2018a Chinese peasant philosopher\u2019 might have said \u2018I \nmake social heat (honghuo), therefore I am\u2019 (2008:485). \n11 In standard Chinese the equivalent in this sense would be lihai. The character \u201cli\u201d means originally sharp, fierce, \nand dangerous; it can also mean \u201cevil ghost\u201d, as in \u201cligui\u201d.  \n12 Cf. Pharoah (2005: chapter 4). \n13 Festa\u2019s gambling partners in Taiwan gave the same ratio of skill and luck in mahjong (Festa 2007:109).  \n  \n \n \n31 \n                                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n14 It would be interesting to explore further the importance of risk taking for the performance of masculinity (as Paul \nFesta has done in his writing on Mahjong in Taiwan, see Festa 2007). Because I lack comparative data on women\u2019s \ngambling, and for reasons of space, I do not explore the issue of gender and gambling in this article.  \n15 See for instance Kulp 1925: 325-326. \n16 A teacher from the local primary school explained this to me with a saying: \u201cthe gentleman loves money, and he \nknows morally appropriate ways to get it\u201d (junzi ai qian, qude you dao). The good-for-nothing (xiaoren), however, \ndoes not have morals; he will use exploitation (boxue) and gambling (dubo) to accrue wealth. \n17 The real estate market in bigger Chinese cities has been exploding, and the prices for apartments rocketing in the \nlast three years; many people in the countryside, especially those who aspire to an apartment in a city, have been \nfollowing these development closely, and they also frequently mentioned that this boom is driven by speculation and \nprofiteering (touji daoba or touji maimai). Just like \u201cexploitation\u201d (boxue), \u201cspeculation\u201d (touji daoba), was an \nactivity the \u201cbad classes\u201d would engage in and be accused of under Maoism. I was told stories of neighbours that \nwere criticized in class struggle sessions for selling minor goods like chairs or vegetables on the black market; they \nwere said to have gone astray onto the \u201ccapitalist road\u201d and to want to engage in speculation and profiteering (touji \ndaoba). \n18 In his other classic short story Diaries of a Madman, Lu Xun had depicted the consequences of the Confucian \nteachings even more drastically: whilst studying extensively the four books and the five classics, the narrator sees the \nwords \u201cEat People!\u201d (chi ren) emerge between the lines of these texts. He falls into paranoia, increasingly convinced \nthat the people in his surroundings, including his doctor and his brother, are prepared to eat him. All these people are \nheartless and false, and bound to a tradition that is really cannibalistic. Shortly after its first publication, Wu Yu wrote \nan essay in which the message was further reduced to a simple equation between Confucianism and Cannibalism \n(Wu 1985[1919]). This argument was frequently cited by radical intellectuals, exemplifying the cruelty of \nConfucianism, the \u201cdoctrine of li\u201d (lijiao). Lu Xun\u2019s short stories are reprinted in Lu Xun (2002).  \n19 In summer 2007 I visited the neighbouring township Songtaiping, which is known locally to be the origin of \nshaofo, and where until now shaofo cards are printed. During this short visit, I was given several introductions to the \nlocal situation, mostly about local economy and culture. Even though local officials are nowadays often \u201cdigging \nout\u201d (wajue) anything that could count as \u201clocal culture\u201d, the shaofo game was never mentioned, only once as an \nanecdote and with a benign smile on the face of the official who told me about it.   \n20 E.g. Enshi Wanbao (Enshi Evening News) 2nd January 2007, \u2018wo zhou sanqi dangyuan ganbu canyu dubo anli bei \nquanshen tongbao\u2019 (The Case of Gambling of Three Cadres from Different Levels of Enshi Prefecture has been \nPublicized in the Whole Province); Enshi Wanbao (Enshi Evening News) 29th September 2007, \u2018guanyu Li Zeyu \n  \n \n \n32 \n                                                                                                                                                              \n \n \ndengren canyu dubo wenti de tongbao\u2019 (Report about the Problem of Li Zeyu and Several Others who Engaged in \nGambling).  \n21 E.g. Enshi Wanbao (Enshi Evening News) 28th March 2007, \u2018dubo shule qian toudao luo fawang\u2019 (Lost Money in \nGambling \u2013 Thief Caught in the Nets of the Law); Enshi Wanbao (Enshi Evening News) 29th October 2007, \u2018dubo \nshule qian xing qie bei zhuahuo\u2019 (Lost money in gambling \u2013 Delinquent was Caught). \n22 A report entitled \u201cFascination for Rural Construction and Forgetting Adversities\u201d (mizui wangfan xin nongcun) \ngives a stereotype of how the results of successful rural development should look like: \u201cNow the villagers and \nneighbours live together in solidarity and harmony, the villagers are actively devoted to rural construction; gambling \n(dubo) and playing cards (dapai), disputes over trifles (che pi la jin), heterodoxy and superstition (xiejiao mixin), do \nnot exist in this village, and instead development, construction and knowledge are quietly on the rise.\u201d (Songtaiping \nTownship 2006).  \n23 \u201cIdeally, then, to play healthy mahjong would involve the self-cultivation of civilizing norms and, at the same time, \nthe reproduction of Chineseness as a commercial value to be capitalized by the regime of accumulation\u201d (2006:26). \n \n"}
