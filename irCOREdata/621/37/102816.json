A disease spectrum, NAFLD progresses from simple steatosis to 3 \nsteatohepatitis, advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis.  An estimated 20-35% of the general population has 4 \nsteatosis and 10% of these will develop the more progressive non-alcoholic steatohepatitis 5 \nassociated with significant increased risk of cardiovascular- and liver-related mortality.  6 \nDevelopment of NAFLD is strongly linked to components of the metabolic syndrome including 7 \nobesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia and type 2 diabetes.  The recognition that NAFLD is an 8 \nindependent risk factor for cardiovascular disease is a major public health concern.  There is 9 \ntremendous need for a sensitive, non-invasive test for early detection and staging of NAFLD that 10 \ncould also be used to monitor response to treatment. The cellular and molecular aetiology of 11 \nNAFLD is multi-factorial; genetic polymorphisms influencing NAFLD have been identified and 12 \nnutrition is a modifiable environmental factor influencing NAFLD progression.  Weight loss 13 \nthrough diet and exercise is the primary recommendation in the clinical management of NAFLD. 14 \nThe application of systems biology to the identification of NAFLD biomarkers and factors involved 15 \nin NAFLD progression is an area of promising research. 16 \n 17 \n 18 \n 3\nIntroduction 1 \nNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease is the pathological accumulation of fat in the liver in the absence 2 \nof alcohol intake. Described initially only 30 years ago(1, 2), it is now the leading cause of liver 3 \ndisease in developed countries with an estimated prevalence of 20-30% in the general population. 4 \nThe occurrence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is strongly linked to obesity, insulin 5 \nresistance and other components of the metabolic syndrome. From a nutrition and public health 6 \nperspective, the two major concerns are the rising incidence of NAFLD in children, and the 7 \nconvincing evidence that NAFLD is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. 8 \nThe term NAFLD encompasses a spectrum of histologically defined liver disorders. Disease can 9 \nprogress from macrovesicular lipid accumulation in the hepatocyte known as steatosis, to non-10 \nalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), steatosis in the presence of inflammatory infiltrate possibly with 11 \nsome fibrosis, to outright fibrosis, cirrhosis and even hepatocellular carcinoma. A combination of 12 \nenvironmental and genetic factors determines individual risk of NAFLD development and 13 \nprogression, with a clear role for nutrition as a modifiable environmental risk factor. Pathogenesis 14 \nof NAFLD was initially envisaged as a \u201ctwo-hit process\u201d(3) with fat accumulation in hepatocyte 15 \nviewed as the primary insult and increased oxidative stress leading to inflammation being the 16 \nsecond \u201chit\u201d in progression to NASH and fibrosis.  At the cellular level however, mechanisms 17 \ninfluencing disease progression are clearly multi-factorial and dependent on numerous genetic and 18 \nenvironmental interactions. Future analysis and modeling of NAFLD progression must account for 19 \nthis complexity in a systems biology fashion. 20 \n 21 \nDiagnosis 22 \nThe majority of NAFLD cases are identified after an incidental finding of either elevated liver 23 \nenzymes on routine blood tests or suspected fatty liver on abdominal imaging in patients 24 \nconsuming little or no alcohol.(4)   After the exclusion of excessive alcohol consumption which is 25 \ngenerally defined as more than 20 g\/day in men and 10 g\/day in women, alternate causes of fatty 26 \nliver (nutritional, genetic, viral, metabolic, drug) must also be excluded prior to diagnosis of 27 \nNAFLD.  While liver enzymes such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and gamma glutamyl 28 \ntranspeptidase (GGT) levels may be found elevated, they are not specific to NAFLD and 29 \nfurthermore the full histological spectrum of NAFLD has been observed in patients with normal 30 \nALT levels.(5)  Non-invasive imaging techniques used for diagnosis of NAFLD include ultrasound, 31 \ncomputed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and proton magnetic resonance 32 \nspectroscopy (1H MRS), each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages.(6) While all these 33 \ntechniques yield information about fat distribution in the liver, MRI and 1H MRS can quantify the 34 \n 4\ntotal amount of fat in the liver.  In a population study using 1H MRS to assess liver fat, almost a 1 \nthird of subjects had hepatic steatosis and 79% of those with steatosis had normal ALT levels.(7)  2 \nThese data highlight the concern that NAFLD prevalence as assessed by liver enzyme alterations is 3 \ngrossly under estimated.   4 \nUltrasound-based transient elastography and magnetic resonance elastography are currently 5 \nbeing investigated for their ability to stage liver fibrosis.(8, 9)  However a BMI greater than 28 was 6 \nshown to cause transient elastography to fail(10), and  magnetic resonance elastography remains 7 \nexperimental.(11)   Although algorithms combining biochemical markers and patient parameters 8 \nhave been developed for predicting steatosis(12), steatohepatitis(13) and fibrosis(14) in NAFLD, these  9 \nrequire independent population validation and still lack sensitivity and specificity for widespread 10 \nuse. Histological assessment of liver biopsies remains the gold standard for diagnosing and staging 11 \nNASH.  However, liver biopsy is invasive and associated with significant morbidities(15) and rare 12 \ncases of mortality(16) precluding its routine use in screening for NAFLD or for repeated assessment 13 \nof either disease progression or response to therapy.  Furthermore, as histological lesions are not 14 \nevenly distributed in the liver, considerable sampling error and misdiagnosis exists.(17)  15 \nConsequently, the identification and validation of noninvasive biomarkers capable of diagnosing 16 \nand staging NAFLD is a research priority.(18)   17 \n 18 \nEpidemiology 19 \nThe lack of an inexpensive, noninvasive screening test for fatty liver disease means the true 20 \npopulation prevalence for NAFLD remains unknown.  Evidence from autopsy(19, 20) and imaging(7, 21 \n21, 22) studies demonstrates NAFLD prevalence in 20-35% of populations worldwide with 10% of 22 \nthese cases being NASH.  Prevalence is much higher among the obese(20, 23-27) and type 2 23 \ndiabetics(28-30) where NAFLD is found in 70-80% of patients, and advanced disease, NASH and 24 \nfibrosis, is found in 25-70% of these cases.  Distinct ethnic differences in the prevalence of NAFLD 25 \nexist.(7, 31)  The largest multiethnic population study to date with 2,287 subjects(7), found the highest 26 \nfrequency of NAFLD in Hispanics (45%) compared to whites (33%) and blacks (24%); a gender 27 \ndifference was only observed in Caucasians (42% men, 24% women). 28 \n Shockingly, NAFLD is now the most common cause of liver disease in children.   Incidence of 29 \npaediatric NAFLD has risen sharply in the last three decades corresponding with the worldwide 30 \nincrease in childhood obesity.   A retrospective review of paediatric autopsy reports in the United 31 \nStates found fatty liver in 13% of children and 38% of obese children between 2 and 19 years 32 \nold.(32)  Estimates of NAFLD prevalence in obese children using ultrasonography range from 45-33 \n60%(33-36), though no survey has been carried out in a UK population.  However, the International 34 \n 5\nObesity Task Force has concluded the lowest estimated prevalence of hepatic steatosis to be 27.9% 1 \namong obese children in the European Union.(37)  Of particular concern are very recent datasets 2 \nshowing that NAFLD in overweight and obese children is not only strongly associated with 3 \ncardiovascular risk factors(38), but also atherosclerosis as measured by carotid intima-media 4 \nthickness.(39) Since 7% of boys and 10% of girls aged 5-18 in the United Kingdom were obese in 5 \n2006(40) (28% and 36% overweight respectively), paediatric NAFLD warrants significant clinical 6 \nand research attention. 7 \n 8 \n 9 \nNAFLD development 10 \nThe pathogenesis of NAFLD begins with accumulation of lipid in the liver.  As only a minority of 11 \npatients with hepatic steatosis progress to the necroinflammatory steatohepatitis and develop 12 \nfibrosis, Day(3) originally conceptualized that a second \u201chit\u201d was required to induce cellular events 13 \n(e.g. oxidative stress) leading to inflammation, cell death and fibrosis.  As with all complex 14 \ndiseases, it is now recognized that the phenotypic expression of NAFLD depends on a myriad of 15 \ngenetic, behavioral and environmental interactions.(41)  16 \nWhile hepatic steatosis can be simplistically viewed as an imbalance between the processes of 17 \nlipid accumulation and lipid disposal, the cellular and molecular regulation of hepatic metabolism 18 \nis intricate and has been the subject of a recent extensive review.(42) Fat in the liver is acquired from 19 \nthe diet, de novo lipogenesis or circulating NEFA and removed through VLDL secretion or by \u03b2-20 \noxidation.  Derangements in each of these pathways have been associated with NAFLD.   21 \nTraditionally it appeared that lipid accumulation in the liver occurred in the context of obesity and 22 \nperipheral insulin resistance, with lipid coming from an elevated plasma NEFA pool caused by 23 \nincreased activity of hormone-sensitive lipase and increased lipolysis from engorged adipocytes. 24 \nMultiple lines of evidence suggest this explanation is likely to be too na\u00efve; indeed it has been 25 \npostulated that systemic insulin resistance might be secondary to NAFLD. (43) 26 \nStable isotope research in NAFLD patients has shown that, although 60% of the TAG in the 27 \nliver comes from the peripheral NEFA pool, elevations in fasting de novo lipogenesis also 28 \ncontribute significantly.(44) Additional work has observed both an increase in adipose lipolysis, and 29 \nincreased VLDL-TAG secretion from the liver in NAFLD patients. (45)  However, not only was the 30 \nincrease in VLDL-TAG secretion not sufficient enough to deal with the increase in hepatic TAG 31 \ncontent in these patients, the VLDL-TAG was derived predominantly from \u201cnonsystemic\u201d NEFA, 32 \neither from de novo lipogenesis or lipolysis of visceral fat.  This is interesting in the light of very 33 \n 6\nrecent 1H-MRS and MRI data showing that hepatic lipid content directly correlates to visceral fat 1 \nlevels.(46)   This study highlights ethnic differences in the manifestations of insulin resistance; 2 \nalthough Hispanics and African Americans have similar frequencies of insulin resistance, African 3 \nAmericans are less likely to have NAFLD, hypertriglyceridaemia and elevated visceral fat depots.  4 \nThese data, as well as data showing NAFLD in nonobese individuals with normal glucose and lipid 5 \nlevels(47), mean NAFLD can and does occur without the backdrop of insulin resistance. 6 \n Once steatosis is established, multiple mechanisms contribute to lipid-induced cellular injury.(48)  7 \nIncreased mitochondrial \u03b2-oxidation of NEFA leads to an increase in reactive oxygen species 8 \n(ROS). Mitochondrial defects have been observed in NAFLD patients and impairment of the 9 \nrespiratory chain also produces ROS and leads to extra-mitochondrial NEFA oxidation in the 10 \nperoxisomes and microsomes producing further ROS.  The overall increase in oxidative stress leads 11 \nto lipid peroxidation, DNA and protein damage and ultimately cell death.  In addition the aldehyde 12 \nbyproducts of lipid peroxidation increase production of proinflammatory cytokines and recruit 13 \ninflammatory cells into the liver.   Inflammation and the activation of hepatic stellate cells leads to 14 \ncollagen production and the initiation of fibrosis. 15 \n Lastly, the pathogenesis of NAFLD is also mediated by transcription factors such as the sterol 16 \nregulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP1), the carbohydrate responsive element-binding 17 \nprotein (ChREBP) and the PPARs which are reviewed elsewhere(49), and influenced by circulating 18 \ncytokines and adipokines.  Adding additional complexity, the levels of all these molecules will 19 \ndepend on both genetic polymorphisms and the presence or absence of disease (e.g. obesity or 20 \nimmune).  Clinical studies reviewed by Tsochatzis and colleagues(50) have shown low levels of the 21 \nanti-inflammatory adiponectin and high levels of the pro-inflammatory resistin, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 22 \ncytokines in NAFLD patients.  Genetic polymorphisms in these cytokines have also been 23 \ninvestigated in NAFLD patients as described later. 24 \n 25 \n 26 \nNAFLD progression and associated mortality 27 \nThe prognosis of patients with NAFLD depends on the histological stage of the disease.  Simple 28 \nsteatosis may have a relatively benign course with no increased risk of mortality, whereas NASH 29 \nmay progress quite rapidly and is associated with significant increased risk of mortality.(51-54)  30 \nProgression in NAFLD is difficult to assess, requiring years of follow up and repeat biopsies which 31 \nare prone to sampling errors.(17, 55)  The longest prospective study of the natural history of NAFLD 32 \nusing repeat biopsies had a mean follow-up of 13.7 years and 129 patients(54).  This study showed 33 \n 7\nthat 47% of patients presenting with steatosis progressed to NASH and 25-50% of patients 1 \npresenting with NASH developed advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis in 8-13 years (Fig. 1).  Although it 2 \nunderscores the fact that patients with steatosis can and do develop steatohepatitis, mortality was 3 \nnot changed in the group presenting with steatosis, whereas survival was significantly lower in 4 \npatients that had presented with NASH (70% versus 80% in reference population, P = 0.01).  5 \nPatients with NAFLD associated cirrhosis have been shown to have a very poor 10 year prognosis, 6 \nwith 50% needing a liver transplant, 20% dying from a liver-related cause and 7% developing 7 \nhepatocellular carcinoma.(56)   Bleakly, a very recent study on the natural history of NAFLD in 8 \nchildren demonstrates that paediatric NAFLD is also progressive and can result in end stage liver 9 \ndisease and death.(57)  In this cohort of 66 children followed over a mean of 6.4 years, 2 children 10 \nunderwent liver transplantation and 2 children died, while observed serial biopsies showed 11 \nprogression in 80% of patients.   12 \nMultiple risk factors have been associated with NAFLD progression including older age(23, 24, 58), 13 \nBMI(24, 53, 58), insulin resistance(54), diabetes(59, 60), metabolic syndrome(61) and histological NASH 14 \nupon diagnosis(52, 54, 62).  A current systematic review of ten studies examined risk factors for 15 \nprogression from NASH to advanced fibrosis.(63) Using multivariate analysis this study found only 16 \nage and presence of inflammation on initial biopsy to independently predict progression in 221 17 \npatients over a 5.3 year follow-up.  The well documented limitations associated with systematic 18 \nreviews(64), particularly the choice and heterogeneity of included studies in this case, likely explain 19 \nwhy obesity, BMI and diabetes were not statistically significant predictors in this analysis. 20 \n Data regarding the mortality risks associated with NAFLD are somewhat conflicting.  The first 21 \npopulation-based cohort study examining NAFLD and mortality determined survival among 420 22 \nNAFLD patients, identified through imaging or biopsy, after a mean follow-up of 7.6 years.(65)  In 23 \nagreement with case series from specialist clinics(52, 54, 60), NAFLD was found associated with 24 \nsignificantly lower survival and increased risk of mortality from liver disease.  After 10 years 25 \nfollow-up (n=161), survival was 77% versus 87% in the general population.    Subsequently 3 26 \nindependent groups have analyzed data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination 27 \nSurvey (NHANES III) of the United States for mortality risk among suspected NAFLD cases based 28 \non elevated ALT levels.(66-68)  While both Ong(66) and Dunn(67) found NAFLD associated with an 29 \nincrease in overall mortality, Ong found NAFLD associated with a huge increase in liver associated 30 \nmortality, whereas Dunn found NAFLD among 45-54 year olds dramatically linked to 31 \ncardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality.  Conversely, Ruhl(68) did not find elevated ALT levels 32 \nassociated with all-cause or CVD mortality but did find a significant association with liver related 33 \nmortality.  Differences are likely explained by variations in study design, patient selection strategy 34 \n 8\nand statistical analysis.  While these studies have the advantage of very large samples sizes from a 1 \nrepresentative sample of the general population, diagnosis of NAFLD is based on elevated ALT 2 \nlevels which do not differentiate between steatosis and steatohepatitis and, as previously 3 \nmentioned, are likely to severely under assess NAFLD incidence and therefore the magnitude of 4 \nmortality risk.  Regardless, the data in total show NAFLD is far from a benign diagnosis. 5 \n 6 \n 7 \nGenetic and environmental factors associated with NAFLD development and progression 8 \nThe development of NAFLD is strongly linked to obesity and insulin resistance.  However, as there 9 \nare obese and diabetic individuals who do not have NAFLD, and since NAFLD can occur in 10 \nnormal weight individuals with normal glucose and lipid levels(47), there are obviously multiple 11 \ngenetic and environmental factors determining NAFLD development and progression (Fig. 2).   12 \n Initial evidence for a genetic component to NAFLD comes from familial clustering studies(69, 70) 13 \nand the ethnic variation in NAFLD prevalence(7).  Various genetic single nucleotide polymorphisms 14 \n(SNPs) have been investigated in NAFLD including SNPs in the adiponectin(71, 72), IL-6(73), TNF-15 \n\u03b1(74), and apolipoprotein E(75) genes among others.  Investigated in a \u201ccandidate gene\u201d fashion in 16 \nsmall cohorts, these studies have yielded somewhat conflicting results in different populations.  In 17 \n2008 the first genome-wide association scan in a large multiethnic population targeting NAFLD, 18 \nidentified the PNPLA3 (Patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3, also known as 19 \nadiponutrin) gene strongly associated with hepatic triglyceride content.(76) Allele variants of the 20 \nPNPLA3 gene associated with high and low amounts of hepatic fat were found enriched in 21 \nHispanics and African-Americans respectively, correlating with the high and low prevalence of 22 \nNALFD in these populations.(7)  Remarkably, PNPLA3 was also independently identified in a 23 \nseparate population-based genome-wide scan as one of two genetic loci influencing plasma levels 24 \nof ALT.(77) Undoubtedly as genome sequencing continues to get cheaper and faster, studies of this 25 \ntype will reveal more genes causal in NAFLD pathogenesis. 26 \n Nutrition and physical activity are important environmental factors determining risk of NAFLD.  27 \nExcess food intake and lack of exercise contribute to weight gain which has been shown to 28 \ncontribute to the progression of liver fibrosis in NAFLD patients.(54)  Specific dietary factors may 29 \nalso play either protective or antagonistic roles in the development and progression of NAFLD.   30 \nAssessment of nutrient intakes in NAFLD has been done in Italian(78), Japanese(79), Israeli(80) and 31 \nUS(81) populations; no UK cohort has been assessed to date.    Increased consumption of meat and 32 \nsoft drinks and low consumption of fish were associated with NAFLD cases as opposed to control.  33 \n 9\nUnsurprisingly, low intakes of PUFA and high intakes of saturated fat and cholesterol were also 1 \nassociated with NAFLD.  Data from two randomised controlled trial have shown beneficial effects 2 \nfrom six months dietary supplementation with n-3 PUFA in NAFLD compared to dietary advice 3 \nalone. (82, 83)   Reductions in fatty liver observed by ultrasonography as well as improvements in 4 \nserum ALT and triglyceride levels were significantly greater in those supplemented with n-3 5 \nPUFA.  In both trials the patients receiving PUFA were more likely to have complete fatty liver 6 \nregression suggesting a beneficial therapeutic effect for n-3 PUFA supplementation in NAFLD.  7 \nOther studies have found higher carbohydrate and lower fat diets associated with more progressive 8 \ndisease.(84, 85) Conversely, very recent animal data alarmingly shows that, in both mice(86) and 9 \nnonhuman primates(87), exposure to a maternal high fat diet leads to development and progression 10 \nof NAFLD in the offspring.  11 \n Given the role of oxidative stress in NAFLD pathogenesis several studies have examined 12 \nantioxidant supplementation as an intervention in NAFLD.  A recent Cochrane review of six very 13 \nsmall and extremely diverse clinical trials did not find enough data to recommend either for or 14 \nagainst the use of antioxidant supplements in NAFLD patients.(88)  However, data from pilot 15 \nstudies(89, 90) and one double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial(91) have shown sufficient 16 \npositive effects with Vitamin E supplementation in NAFLD patients that this supplement is now the 17 \nsubject of two ongoing multicenter trials.  The \u201cPioglitazone versus Vitamin E versus Placebo for 18 \nthe Treatment of Non-diabetic Patients with Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis\u201d (PIVENS) trial(92) in 19 \nadults and the \u201cTreatment of Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Children\u201d (TONIC) trial(93) both 20 \ninvolve 96 weeks of treatment and will measure improvements in histology as well as ALT levels.  21 \nWhile the PIVENS trial has 3 arms and includes a placebo group, the TONIC trial in children will 22 \ncompare metformin treatment to Vitamin E supplementation.   Data from these trials, whether 23 \nnegative or positive, should end the debate on efficacy of Vitamin E supplementation in NAFLD. 24 \n Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) may be an additional environmental factor 25 \ninvolved in NAFLD pathogenesis where dietary supplements such as probiotics could have a 26 \nbeneficial effect.   Evidence from animal studies shows that SIBO increases gut permeability 27 \nleading to portal endotoxaemia and increased circulating inflammatory cytokines both of which 28 \nhave been implicated in the progression of NAFLD.(94)  Several reports have found SIBO 29 \nassociated with progressive NAFLD(95-97) and in one small human study, treatment with antibiotics 30 \nresulted in an increase in fasting insulin levels.(97)  Limited evidence from animal models and one 31 \npreliminary human study suggest supplementation with the probiotic VSL#3 may possibly be 32 \nbeneficial in NAFLD, but data is mixed.(98-100)  More research in this area is warranted. 33 \n 34 \n 10\n  1 \nNAFLD, the metabolic syndrome and CVD risk 2 \nThe metabolic syndrome was originally defined as a cluster of CVD risk factors with insulin 3 \nresistance considered the underlying pathogenic factor.(101)  The third report of the National 4 \nCholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High 5 \nBlood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel III [ATP III]) defines metabolic syndrome as 6 \nbeing any three or more of five variables: increased waist circumference,  hypertriglyceridaemia, 7 \nhypertension, low HDL cholesterol, and hyperglycaemia.(102)  Metabolic syndrome is highly 8 \nprevalent among NAFLD patients in multiple populations and is strongly associated with 9 \nprogressive disease.(61, 103-105)  Equally, a Japanese prospective study (N=3147) demonstrated that 10 \npatients with metabolic syndrome, as defined by ATP III, were 4 to 11 times (men and women 11 \nrespectively) more likely to have developed NAFLD upon follow-up.(106) Likewise, children with 12 \nmetabolic syndrome as defined by ATP III have been shown to be 5 times more likely to have 13 \nNAFLD.(38) This strong relationship between NAFLD and the metabolic syndrome has led to the 14 \ndescription of NAFLD as the hepatic component of the metabolic syndrome.   15 \n Indeed, in the last five years NAFLD has emerged as an independent risk factor for CVD.  16 \nSeveral studies have observed increased carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and carotid plaques 17 \nin NAFLD patients, including children.(39, 107-111) Although there has been some conflicting 18 \nwork(112), a systematic review found that carotid plaques were 2 to 3 times more likely to be 19 \nobserved in NAFLD patients and IMT was strongly associated with NAFLD.(113)  Furthermore, 20 \nmultiple population studies have observed increased CVD events in NAFLD patients diagnosed by 21 \nultrasonography and demonstrated that the increased risk for CVD in NAFLD is independent of 22 \nconventional risk factors and components of the metabolic syndrome.(114-116) These data add to 23 \npopulation data where elevated liver enzymes have also been associated with increased risk for 24 \nCVD.(67, 117)   25 \nEssentially as the treatment of NAFLD involves correcting the same metabolic factors involved 26 \nin CVD, it is prudent that all patients with NAFLD be evaluated for early atherosclerosis.  27 \nLikewise, patients presenting with the metabolic syndrome or a high Framingham risk score(118) 28 \nshould be evaluated for the presence of NAFLD.  Children identified with NAFLD or the metabolic 29 \nsyndrome should be strongly counseled to avoid smoking, increase their physical activity and 30 \nimprove their nutrition in order to prevent the development of cardiovascular disease. 31 \n 32 \n 33 \nThe potential of systems biology 34 \n 11\nSystems biology is the study of a biological system (cell, tissue, organism) viewed as an 1 \nintegrated and interacting network of genes, proteins and biochemical reactions.  This methodology 2 \ncombines computational modeling with experimental biology in order to discover emergent 3 \nproperties that arise from studying a system as a whole; it is these properties that ultimately 4 \ndetermine how a system is controlled or regulated.  In a systems approach one begins by 5 \nconstructing a predictive model from which a hypothesis is formed and then tested experimentally 6 \nby perturbing the system.  Experimental techniques are generally the global approaches of 7 \ngenomics, proteomics and metabolomics.  Data obtained from these multiple approaches are 8 \nintegrated and compared to the original model, which is refined in an iterative process.  In the 9 \ncontext of human health it is believed that systems biology is essential to future drug discovery and 10 \nindeed, to a future of personalized, predictive and preventative medicine.(119)  In this vision, drug 11 \ntargets would be rational and identified through the analysis of normal and disease perturbed 12 \nnetworks, while an individual could have their genome sequenced and in combination with 13 \nextensive blood analyses would be able to obtain a \u201cprobabilistic future health history\u201d.  Although 14 \nsystems biology is in its infancy and this vision still seems far off, global approaches have been 15 \napplied to NAFLD and these datasets are relevant to the future creation of an integrated \u201csystems\u201d 16 \nmodel of NAFLD. 17 \n Proteomic technologies are still evolving and analysis of a complete proteome, in the manner of 18 \nDNA microarray analysis of complete genomes, has yet to be realized.  However, as disease 19 \nbiomarkers and drug targets are most likely to be proteins, proteomics is viewed as central to 20 \nsystems biology and key to predictive medicine.(120)  In the context of NAFLD, proteomic 21 \ntechniques have been used to analyze adipose(121), liver(122) and most recently serum(123) samples in 22 \nNAFLD patients.  Ultimately it is most likely that a serum diagnostic or prognostic tool for 23 \nNAFLD would be comprised of a panel of proteins, and this research highlights the power of 24 \nsystems methodologies for identifying candidate protein biomarkers. Significantly in the study by 25 \nBell and colleagues(123) their \u201cpotential biomarker panel\u201d comprising of 6 proteins demonstrated 26 \ngreater diagnostic utility than ALT to differentiate between their patient groups. It is also 27 \nnoteworthy that Charlton(122) and Bell(123) independently identified lumican, a protein that activates 28 \ntransforming growth factor-beta and smooth muscle actin, elevated in both liver and serum from 29 \nNASH patients.  These studies have given insight into NAFLD pathogenesis and have identified 30 \ncandidate disease biomarkers worthy of prospective validation.   31 \n 32 \n 33 \nConclusion 34 \n 12\nNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease is highly prevalent with an estimated 20-30% of the UK 1 \npopulation effected.  Research on the natural history of NAFLD has demonstrated that even simple 2 \nsteatosis can not be considered benign as 47% of these patients will progress to NASH in 8-13 3 \nyears.  An estimated 25-50% of patients with NASH will progress to advanced fibrosis and 4 \ncirrhosis.  In real numbers this is 300,000 to 1.8 million cases in the UK, 50% of whom will require 5 \na liver transplant to avoid death.  It is clear that a diagnosis of NAFLD is associated with increased 6 \nrisk of mortality from liver- and cardiovascular-related events and the British Liver Trust has 7 \ndemonstrated that liver disease is the only major cause of death still increasing yearly in the 8 \nUK.(124)  An additional public health concern is the rising incidence of NAFLD in children who are 9 \nnot exempt from risk of cardiovascular disease, the need for liver transplants or early death.  Part of 10 \nthe challenge in assessing the burden of NAFLD in the population is the lack of a non-invasive 11 \nscreening test for NAFLD.   12 \nWhile NAFLD incidence is strongly linked to insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome, the 13 \ndevelopment and progression of NAFLD involves a myriad of molecular and cellular events that 14 \nare influenced by both genetic and environmental factors.  Determination of the critical factors 15 \ninvolved in disease progression will identify possible therapeutic targets for treatment of NAFLD 16 \nand may form the basis of prognostic tests. Proteomic studies are beginning to identify serum and 17 \nliver proteins found altered in NAFLD. The modeling of NAFLD protein and gene regulatory 18 \nnetworks in a systems biology fashion is most likely to yield diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic 19 \ntargets for NAFLD and more research of this type is urgently needed.   20 \n 21 \n 22 \nAcknowledgements 23 \nThe author thanks David J.
