All rights reserved.\nKeywords: Complexity theory; Geography; Networks; Inequalities; Spatial diffusionEvery PhD student in everything should get to grips\nwith the \u2018\u2018chaos\/complexity\u2019\u2019 programme, not for\nreasons of fashion or even legitimate career building\nbut because this is the way the world works and we\nneed to understand that (Byrne, 1998, p. 161).Introduction\nThis paper considers\u2014in a sympathetically critical\nway\u2014the rapidly expanding \u2018complexity turn\u2019 within the\nsocial sciences and, specifically, the relevance it has for\ngeographies of health (Gatrell, 2002).

Gatrell).emerged during the past 5 years as a potentially\nintegrating theme in contemporary social science (Byrne,\n1998; Urry, 2003). Urry (2003, p. 12) observes that\ncomplexity is \u2018a potential new paradigm for the social\nsciences, having transformed much of the physical and\nbiological sciences\u2019. He sees it as a means of dissolving\nsome of the binary divides (whether quantitative\/\nqualitative, environmental\/social, structure\/agency, or\nmedical\/sociocultural) within the academy. He even\nsuggests that complexity might help break down\ndivisions between the social and the natural sciences\n(Urry, 2003, pp. 12\u201313, p. 17).\nThe engagement of social geographers with the\ncomplexity agenda has, to date, been modest (though\nsee the important paper by Thrift, 1999). Manson (2001)\nhas offered a valuable critique of the relevance complex-\nity theory has for geographical research as a whole. Myd.\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nA.C. Gatrell \/ Social Science & Medicine 60 (2005) 2661\u201326712662aim here is to locate this critique within the narrower\nfield of health geography and to consider the extent to\nwhich complexity theory (hereafter, CT) \u2018adds value\u2019 to\nexisting relevant perspectives in health geography.\nI first consider briefly what complexity theory\namounts to; what are its key features? I then consider\nthe philosophical underpinnings of CT as an anti-\npositivist perspective, and its reliance on metaphor.\nNext, I review several broad areas of research in which\nhealth geographers are engaged and discuss and evaluate\nhow complexity theory has been used in each. I conclude\nwith an assessment of some of the missing elements in\nCT and suggest that while we should welcome any\nengagement with theory in health geography, we also\nneed sound empirical work to set alongside this.A simple look at complexity theory\nKey characteristics of complexity theory\nA system is \u2018complex\u2019 when it displays the character-\nistics outlined in Table 1 (based on Cilliers (1998) but\nsupplemented with a set of simple illustrations of what is\nmeant by each characteristic). In essence, a system\ndisplays complex behaviour when its elements interact in\na non-linear fashion, such that it is impossible to predict\nthe behaviour of the system as a whole from knowledge\nof the elements themselves. I focus on four key aspects\nof CT that are embedded in Table 1: relations and\nnetworks; non-linearity; emergence; and hybrids. I end theTable 1\nThe main features of complex systems (partly based on Cilliers, 1998\nCharacteristics of complex systems\nLarge number of elements, interacting dynamically (via flows\nof material or information) across networks\nInteraction is rich and may involve both human and non-\nhuman agents (hybrids) or elements\nInteractions may be short range but the richness of interactions\nor relations across networks means that \u2018influence\u2019 can be wide\nranging\nEach element is \u2018ignorant\u2019 of the behaviour of the system as a\nwhole; therefore, we cannot understand the system by\n\u2018summing\u2019 or \u2018averaging\u2019 the behaviour of individual\ncomponents; system-wide properties emerge\nInteractions are non-linear (which also implies that small causes\nhave large results).

In a biological setting this might be an\necosystem, comprising sets of plants and animals and\naccompanying soil\u2013climate sub-systems. In social\nscience it might be a transport network that moves\npeople and goods from one place to another, a system\nthat includes \u2018hybrids\u2019 of social and material elements.\nIn a health context it might be the set of elements that\npermit and constrain the spread of a virus within a local\ncommunity and beyond. These elements could comprise\nthe virus itself, infected and susceptible individuals,\nhealth-care resources, transport systems, and so on. It is\nthe relations between system components that are pre-\neminent\u2014how these links and connections bind together\nthe system elements (Capra, 1997).\nA considerable volume of material\u2014much of a quasi-\npopular nature (Baraba\u00b4si, 2002; Watts, 1999) is now\nemerging on networks. The relationship of this to\ncomplexity is well-expressed by Baraba\u00b4si (2002, p. 7):\n\u2018Most events and phenomena are connected, caused by,\nand interacting with a huge number of other pieces of a\ncomplex universal puzzle. We have come to see that we\nlive in a small world, where everything is linked to\neverything else. We are witnessing a revolution in the\nmaking as scientists from all disciplines discover that\ncomplexity has a strict architecture. We have come to\ngrasp the importance of networks\u2019 (my italics).

Gatrell \/ Social Science & Medicine 60 (2005) 2661\u20132671 2663Watts (1999) and Baraba\u00b4si (2002) document the\napparently complex structure and organisation of net-\nworks of various kinds, including the social networks\nthat link complete strangers anywhere in the world by\nabout six intermediaries. This is the so-called \u2018small-\nworld\u2019 problem first developed in detail in the late 1960s\nby the social psychologist Stanley Milgram. Buchanan\n(2002, p. 127) considers that \u2018the small-world discovery\nand other ideas now growing out of it represent one of\nthe first great successes of the theory of complexity\u2019.\nBy non-linearity we mean that small changes in one\ncomponent or element of the network do not lead to\ncorrespondingly small changes in others. A change in\none element is not directly proportional to change in\nanother; more prosaically, little changes can have big\neffects. By feedback is meant the arrangement of\nnetworked relationships such that one element affects\nothers which in turn can, ultimately, affect the original\nelement. A very simple example would be that vehicle\nexhaust emissions increase the burden of air pollution,\nwhich may in turn increase the incidence of asthma. A\ncontrol mechanism (and hence negative feedback) might\nbe to reduce traffic levels, thereby cutting exhaust\nemissions.\nThe emergence of new structures, via the interactions\nof system elements, and of new forms of behaviour, is\ncritical to the understanding of complex systems (Hol-\nland, 1998). Relationships \u2018shift and change, often as a\nresult of self-organisation\u2019 (Cilliers, 1998, p. viii\u2013ix), and\nnew system properties may emerge. \u2018The capacity for\nself-organisation is a property of complex systems which\nenables them to develop or change internal structure\nspontaneously and adaptively in order to cope with, or\nmanipulate, their environment\u2019 (Cilliers, 1998, p. 90).\nSelf-organisation does not imply some teleological\ncontrol mechanism; rather, it implies a process whereby\ncomplex structure emerges through simple, unstructured\nbeginnings. Others speak of autopoiesis (literally, self-\nmaking), where each system component aids the\ntransformation of other components; the network\nmakes itself. What might be examples of emergent\nproperties in the geography of health; what emerges at a\ncollective level that cannot be reduced to statements\nabout individuals? The \u2018health\u2019 of a neighbourhood or\ncommunity could be said to emerge from the activities\nand health profiles of the local population, as well as the\nnature of facilities (health-promoting and health-deny-\ning) located there. \u2018Social capital\u2019 would be another\nexample of an emergent property. Conversely, the\nmortality profile of such a neighbourhood is, in effect,\nthe summation of individual deaths and would not be\nsaid to be an emergent property.\nLast, we must note that complexity theory entails a\nfusing of the natural or material and the social. Urry\nnotes that \u2018the so-called social sciences now deal with\nhybrids of physical and social relations, with no purifiedsets of the physical or the social. Such hybrids include\nhealth, technologies, the environment, the internet,\nautomobility, extreme weather and so on\u2019 (Urry (2003,\np. 2). The recognition that complexity theory gives to\nconnectedness and hybridity, and to breaking down\ndivisions (whether the social and material, structure and\nagency, or macro\/micro) means that it has much in\ncommon with actor-network theory (Milligan, 2001;\nLaw & Moll, 2002), although as yet there seems little\ncoming together of actor-network and complexity\ntheorists.\nA brief comment is required on the relationship of CT\nto the better-known chaos theory. Reitsma (2003, p. 14)\nsees chaos theory as dealing with simple, deterministic,\nnon-linear, dynamic, closed systems that are sensitive to\ninitial conditions. Conversely, complexity theory focuses\non non-linear, open systems. These respond to perturba-\ntion by organising into emergent forms which cannot be\npredicted from knowledge only of the system parts. As\nSherden (cited in Thrift, 1999, p. 61) argues: \u2018Chaos\nrefers to turbulent behaviour in a system where the\nbehaviour is totally determined by non-linear laws which\namplify the smallest of errors in the initial conditions of\nthe system, making the system unpredictable beyond the\nshortest of periods. Complexity refers to the phenom-\nenon of order emerging from complex interactions\namong the components of a system influenced by one\nor more simple guiding principles\u2019.\nWhat methods do we have that allow us to visualise,\ndescribe, and analyse relational structure, without\ndecomposing the system into constituent elements?\nPossibilities here would include the \u2018rich pictures\u2019 of\nPeter Checkland\u2019s soft systems methodology (Check-\nland, 1981), qualitative mathematical approaches such\nas Q-analysis (Gould, 1981), or visual-exploratory forms\nof statistical analysis, such as correspondence analysis\n(used in Bourdieu\u2019s early work and championed by\nByrne (1998, pp. 86\u201387) as a means of exploring the\ndynamics of the social world; see Gatrell et al., 2004, for\nan application). In all of these methods, the emphasis is\nvery much to avoid imposing linear statistical models on\nreality. In the modelling of complex systems, Cilliers\n(1998) considers that connectionist models of complex\nsystems (such as those based on neural nets) are useful.\nNew wine in old bottles?\nSome characteristics of \u2018complex\u2019 systems (such as\nrelationality, networked connections, non-linearity and\nfeedback) are shared with systems approaches that have\nbeen in existence for 50 years or more. The concern with\nrelations is common to all systems-based approaches\n(including the General Systems Theory with which\ngeographers toyed in the mid-late1960s; Manson, 2001,\np. 406). Further, the argument that relations are more\nimportant than the objects or system parts is shared with\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nA.C. Gatrell \/ Social Science & Medicine 60 (2005) 2661\u201326712664other accounts in social science. For example, Bourdieu\n(and his predecessor Elias: see Shilling, 1993) sought to\nstress the \u2018profound relationality\u2019 of which Urry (2003,\np. 122) speaks (Bourdieu, 1984).\nFurther, the current pre-occupation of complexity\ntheorists with network structure resonates with one of\nthe archetypal areas of positivist spatial analysis, namely\nnetwork analysis (see, for example, Haggett & Chorley,\n1969). It is somewhat ironic to think that this might be\nreappearing (Baraba\u00b4si, 2002; Watts, 1999; Buchanan,\n2002) after being largely ignored by geographers for 25\nyears. This neglect was occasioned by the emphasis of\nspatial analysts on network description and spatial\nform, and the lack of any social content. However, the\nconsiderable contemporary effort expended on shedding\nlight on the structure of social networks (and particu-\nlarly the \u2018small-world\u2019 problem) seems little concerned\nwith the realities of social interaction. A Rwandan\nrefugee may be six steps away from the President of the\nUnited States, but the probability of them ever\ninteracting directly is vanishingly small. Comments such\nas \u2018[t] he global village we\u2019ve grown used to inhabiting is\na new reality for humans\u2019 (Baraba\u00b4si, 2002, p. 39) ring\nrather hollow for most of the billions living in the\nvillage. Moreover, a very respectable literature on social\nnetworks and health has built up (see, for example,\nCattell, 2001), without recourse to complexity theory.\nIs complexity theory therefore merely 1970s systems\ntheory by another name? To what extent is complexity\ntheory just new wine in the old bottle of a systems-based\napproach? One can read in Stafford Beer\u2019s iconoclastic\nsystems-based book, published over 25 years ago, many\nof the elements of a complexity account (Beer, 1975).\nHowever, while classical systems approaches emphasise\nproblem-solving, prediction and control, complexity\ntheorists undertake exploratory research that empha-\nsises explanation and understanding. Moreover, while\nrelations and networks are critical in complexity theory,\nas they were in classical approaches, CT foregrounds\nnotions of emergence and hybrids. It is these features\nthat perhaps provide \u2018added value\u2019 and which were\nmissing from classical systems-theoretic accounts. In\nreviewing health geography accounts that have invoked\nCT, we need therefore to be alert to the extent to which\nthey draw upon these features as well as more\nconventional system properties.\nPhilosophical underpinnings and the value of metaphor\nI want here to consider briefly the philosophical\nunderpinnings of CT and the extent to which it draws,\nproductively or otherwise, on metaphor.\nByrne (1998, p. 35) argues that complexity accounts\nare a part of the modernist programme and that\n\u2018Bhaskar\u2019s scientific realism provides a philosophical\nontology which fits pretty well exactly with the scientificontology underpinning the complexity programme\u2019.\nComplex accounts are \u2018absolutely not reductionist and\npositivist\u2019. Like Urry, Byrne sees complexity theory as a\nway of relating macro and micro, agency and structure.\nIn contrast, Cilliers (1998) identifies complexity as a\npostmodern enterprise. For him, postmodern (perhaps,\nbetter, post-structuralist) means a sensitivity to complex-\nity. This is roundly endorsed by Henrickson and\nMcKelvey (2002), who suggest that the ontology of\npostmodernism parallels that of complexity scientists.\n\u2018The lesson from complexity science is that natural\nscientists have begun finding ways to practice normal\nscience without assuming away the activities of hetero-\ngeneous autonomous agents. There is no reason, now,\nwhy social scientists cannot combine \u2018\u2018new\u2019\u2019 normal\nscience epistemology with postmodernist ontology. Yet\nvery few have done so\u2019 (Henrickson & McKelvey, 2002,\np. 7293). Stewart sees complexity theory as \u2018a child of\nthe enlightenment\u2019 (Stewart, 2001, p. 334) although he\nalso notes its use as an argument against positivism and\ninstrumentalism in social science.\nStewart is highly critical of the use of metaphor in\ncomplexity theory. \u2018The concepts and the poetic imagery\nof complexity theories may indeed throw light on social\nprocess; however [whether there is] a universal social\nattractor must be determined by social debates and\nresearch rather than by complexity metatheory\u2019 (Stew-\nart, 2001, p. 332). For Stewart, \u2018the application of\nmetatheoretical organismic models to society and its\nsubsystems seems highly pre-mature; and physicalistic\naccounts of non-linearity in society that exclude the\nsymbolic systems of classification are dabbling with the\nedges of social structure and systematic features\u2019\n(Stewart, 2001, p. 351). We therefore need to consider\nbriefly the value, or otherwise, of the metaphors that are\npart of the currency of CT.\nWhile imploring us to consider the relevance of the\nphysics of complexity for contemporary social science,\nUrry argues that physical science models should not be\ndirectly transplanted into the social sciences. Rather, he\nwishes to \u2018consider whether complexity could generate\nproductive metaphors for the social analysis of various\n\u2018\u2018post-societal\u2019\u2019 material worlds\u2019 (2003, p. 121). Thrift,\nlike Urry, considers CT to be \u2018deeply metaphorical\u2019\n(Thrift, 1999, p. 36), but, interestingly, the metaphors\n\u2018nearly all strongly depend upon the visual register\u2019\n(Thrift, 1999, p. 37). Thrift further notes (1999, p. 49)\nthat \u2018the use of \u2018\u2018scientific\u2019\u2019 metaphors adds a touch of\nlegitimacy\u2019 for some knowledge networks (such as New\nAge practices)\u2014echoing the more trenchant (and con-\ntroversial) critique of Sokal and Bricmont (1998). These\nauthors consider that \u2018examples of scientism can be\nfound in the alleged \u2018\u2018applications\u2019\u2019 of the theories of\nchaos, complexity and self-organisation to sociology,\nhistory and business management\u2019 (Sokal & Bricmont,\n1998, p. 181). They are not against \u2018extrapolating\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nA.C. Gatrell \/ Social Science & Medicine 60 (2005) 2661\u20132671 2665concepts from one field to another, but only against\nextrapolations made without argument\u2014or throwing\naround scientific jargon in front ofynon-scientist read-\ners without any regard for its relevance or even its\nmeaning\u2019 (Sokal & Bricmont, 1998, pp. ix\u2013x). The\nimporting of concepts must have some conceptual or\nempirical justification. They observe that \u2018a metaphor is\nusually employed to clarify an unfamiliar concept by\nrelating it to a more familiar one, not the reverse\u2019 (Sokal\n& Bricmont, 1998, p. 9). Further, \u2018The natural sciences\nare not a mere reservoir of metaphors ready to be used\nin the human sciencesyin a scientific context these\nwords (chaos, non-linearity, for example) have specific\nmeanings\u2019 (Sokal & Bricmont, 1998, p. 177). They seek\ntheorising that is supported by empirical evidence if it is\nto be taken seriously and not simply an opportunity to\nborrow uncritically from the physical sciences.\nWhile, therefore, metaphors are appealing and, in\nsome cases, essential to the development of social\nscience, we need to be wary of those who seek to dress\nup what might be rather ordinary accounts with the\nsomewhat casual use of concepts drawn from complex-\nity theory.Complex geographies of health?\nWhy might complexity theory appeal to health\ngeographers? There are several reasons. First, CT is\ntransdisciplinary (Albrecht et al., 1998); many of the\nleading exponents are those with training in the physical\nsciences but who are now working across the physical\nand social sciences. Traditionally, health geographers\nhave drawn upon many disciplines (including epidemiol-\nogy, statistics, sociology, ecology, cultural studies) to\ninform their work and so any post-disciplinary perspec-\ntive that applauds this fuzziness of boundaries is\nsomething to which we might be expected to warm.\nSecond, according to Urry (2003, p. 111) CT subverts\nthe distinction between agency and structure; if we want\nto gain some understanding of the emergence of\nstructure, we need to understand the behaviours of the\nagents that form part of the system. However, while this\nhas obvious appeal across much of the social sciences,\nnot exclusively the geography of health, it is a feature\nshared with other perspectives (for example, the\nstructurationist accounts of Giddens, or Bourdieu\u2019s\nrelational sociology).\nThird, the metaphors, and some of the methods, used\nin complexity theory are essentially visual. Despite the\ndisappearance of the graphical and the carto-graphical\nfrom much of the research literature, the \u2018seeing eye\u2019 and\nthe ability to detect and describe pattern remains at the\nforefront of many research methods, including health\ngeography (see, for example, MacKian, 2000). Fourth,\nthere is an attraction to moving away from reductionistaccounts. \u2018Far too often attempts at the development of\na quantitatively founded causal account in sociology\nhave been relatively trivial models of the determinants of\noutcome for individuals or other entities within a social\nsystem. What is required is a return to the concern with\nthe nature of the social system as a wholey\u2019 (Byrne,\n1998, p. 56, my emphasis). I find this characteristic\nparticularly persuasive, since far too much epidemiology\nis of the \u2018risk-factor\u2019 type in which particular factors are\ncontrolled in order to reveal the independent effects of\nothers; context and relationship are often marginalised.\nLast, Urry\u2019s recent landmark text (2003) is entitled\n\u2018Global Complexity\u2019. If we still claim to be geographers,\nstudents of the earth, it seems more than a little odd for\nmany of us (but not all: see Mayer, 2000, for example) to\nbe ignoring the \u2018big\u2019 questions of global inequality,\nglobal disease burdens, and the large-scale social and\neconomic processes that create patterns of health at the\nglobal scale. Might we not seek to use complexity theory\nto do less work at very fine spatial scales and more at the\nglobal scale?\nI consider below some areas of research in which a\ncomplexity \u2018take\u2019 has been adopted, and, briefly, areas\nwhere it might prove productive.\nHealth inequalities\nBrown and Moon (2002, pp. 362\u2013363) note that the\nnew public health has \u2018advocated a multi-causal\napproach that saw infectious and chronic, degenerative\ndisorders as being the result of a complex interaction\nbetween biophysical, social or psychological factors\u2019 (my\nitalics). Complexity is about relationships that cannot be\nreduced to simple linear models or their variants (such as\nlogistic regression). It counters much traditional (geo-\ngraphical and environmental) epidemiology and public\nhealth that relates health outcomes to determinants at\nthe individual level. Even the now widely used multi-\nlevel modelling (MLM) is cast within the same mould,\nsince it fails to capture connection, relationship and\ncontext in an adequate way. While Byrne (1998, p. 68)\nsays that \u2018the world does consist of things which contain\nthingsythe hierarchical character of data is real\u2019, and\nKrieger (1994) also applauds the use of MLM as a\ndevice for capturing the often-missed contextual factors,\nit is doubtful that MLM offers an adequate methodol-\nogy for capturing the complexity of context. It is not just\nthe individuals or a simple aggregation thereof that\nmatter\u2014the containing social system matters too.\nInterestingly, Byrne goes on to mention Richard\nWilkinson\u2019s work, in which death rates (from the\naggregation of individuals) are related to inequality\n(\u2018an emergent property of the relationship between\nindividual incomes and wealth\u2019\u2014Byrne, 1998, p. 70).\nUnemployment rates, tenure patterns, mortality are\nexamples of system properties with social significance\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nA.C. Gatrell \/ Social Science & Medicine 60 (2005) 2661\u201326712666and system effects; to this list we could add residential\nsegregation and social capital.\nKrieger (1994) discusses the metaphorical \u2018web\u2019 of\ncausative factors and disease outcomes in epidemiology,\n\u2018an elegantly linked network of delicate strandsysym-\nbolising diverse causal pathways\u2019 (Krieger, 1994, p. 890).\nBut, as she notes, the \u2018web\u2019 was \u2018spiderless\u2019, positing a\nbiomedical model in which the orientation was indivi-\ndualistic rather than population-focused and reflecting a\nconcern less with epidemiological theory and more with\nepidemiological methods. One alternative to a web-\nbased approach would be a political economy perspec-\ntive in which the health status of different social groups\n(women versus men, gays versus straights, black versus\nwhite, poor versus rich) are compared in terms of the\nrelations between such groups. Krieger, however, prefers\nan \u2018ecosocial\u2019 epidemiological theory in which popula-\ntion-level approaches are combined with biological\nthinking. She would replace the web metaphor with a\n\u2018fractal\u2019 metaphor in which biological and social factors\nare linked at every level or scale. Admittedly, \u2018this is not\na developed metaphor\u2019 (Krieger, 1994, p. 899); none-\ntheless, at a very broad scale it is very much in keeping\nwith a complexity agenda in which there are no sharp\nboundaries between global social relations and the\nenvironment (Urry, 2003, p. 46).\nRod and Deborah Wallace have traced the dynamics\nof socially and physically disintegrating inner-city\nneighbourhoods in the US, particularly the Bronx\ndistrict of New York City during the 1970s. They see\nthe links between these processes (or urban desertifica-\ntion) and health-related outcomes (AIDS, TB, violence)\nin explicitly systems terms, speaking of their coming\ntogether in a \u2018mutually reinforcing nexus\u2019 (Wallace &\nWallace, 1997, p. 789; see also Wallace et al., 1999).\nElsewhere, \u2018the physical decay of community increases\nsocial disorganisation leading to behavioural pathology\nwhich triggers yet more physical destruction and so on\nin a destabilising positive feedback loop\u2019 (Wallace &\nWallace, 1997, p. 798). There is a tipping point at work\nhere: \u2018We will suggest that relatively \u2018\u2018small\u2019\u2019 perturba-\ntions of public policy or socioeconomic structure can be\namplified by stressed human ecosystemsyso as literally\nto shatter community structures\u2019 (Wallace & Wallace,\n1997, p. 791). This is particularly so where the\ncommunity is stressed already or marginalised.\nThere is a clear and direct link between the Wallaces\u2019\nwork and that emerging from those exploring social\ncapital in public health contexts. For the Wallaces, local\ncommunities and neighbourhoods are a complex system\nof friendship, kinship and acquaintance networks,\ntogether with associational ties (churches, social clubs\nand so on). Disruption of these networks has health\nconsequences: \u2018public policies of disinvestment in urban\nminority communitiesywill, through a variety of inter-\nacting and self-reinforcing mechanisms, slowly erode theprobability of effective interaction between individuals\nor extended families within those communities. At some\npoint those policies will reduce that probability below\nthreshold, causing a sudden fragmentation of pre-\nexisting community structures\u2019 (Wallace & Wallace,\n1997, p. 798, my italics).\nNeighbourhood deterioration has severe impacts on\nall social networks that are health sustaining. Thus, they\nsuggest, deteriorating local environmental context may\ntrigger sudden disruption of social networks, which will\nfragment communities and enable the emergence of a\nsocial context in which disease and unhealthy beha-\nviours emerge. These system shocks, they argue, get\ntransmitted from place to place\u2014from the worst-\naffected central cities into surrounding suburbs, via\ncommuting fields: \u2018Ultimate endemic levels of emerging\nor reemerging infectious disease within the most\ndevastated neighbourhoods of the largest citiesywill\nstrongly drive endemic levels in counties and metropo-\nlitan regions connected to them by the socioeconomi-\ncally determined travel patterns which structure the\nUSA at regional and national scales (Wallace &\nWallace, 1999, p. 1800). So, at a national scale the\nprevalence of AIDS in the USA is accounted for by\nsocial proximity to (contact with) New York City, as\nwell as a measure of social disintegration (violent crime)\nand manufacturing employment. Using methods from\nthe study of ecosystem dynamics, the authors show how\nwe might estimate the impact, on the system, of external\nperturbations such as economic decline, population\nturnover, or welfare reform. The system resilience is\nquantifiable. The response is to reconstruct communities\nand community infrastructure.\nIn another work (Wallace & Fullilove, 1999), Wallace\nconsiders the \u2018drivers\u2019 behind community instability.\nThese include the size of the marginalised community\nand the level of community resources (aggregate\nincome). The authors warn that: \u2018batter the vulnerable\nand generate murder, AIDS, and multiple-drug-resistant\ntuberculosis, often in far more than proportion to that\nbattering, because phase changeyis highly non-linear\nand sensitive to external perturbation\u2019 (Wallace &\nFullilove, 1999, p. 733, my italics). In his care-\nful overview of the Wallaces\u2019 work, Gould (1993,\npp. 124\u2013135) draws explicitly on complexity ideas, using\na phase diagram that helps scientists to visualise how\na complex system changes over time by tracing\nits trajectory (Gould, 1993, p. 128; see especially his\nFig. 10.1).\nI consider that the Wallaces\u2019 research is among the\nmost persuasive CT-based accounts in health geogra-\nphy, not least because it rises above metaphor to draw\nupon the literal basis of systems theory, but also it\nforegrounds issues of emergence that underpin complex-\nity theory. Further, one important conclusion we take\nfrom the Wallaces\u2019 work is that we neglect spatial\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nA.C. Gatrell \/ Social Science & Medicine 60 (2005) 2661\u20132671 2667diffusion at our peril\u2014this brings it back centre-stage\nand is considered next.\nSpatial diffusion of disease\nIf we consider disease diffusion at the global scale we\ncan see clearly the impacts that disease outbreaks in one\npart of the world have, very rapidly, on social life both\nclose by and at some distance. The complexity theorist\nBuchanan (2002) refers to the sudden break-out of HIV\ninfection from its likely hearth in Lake Victoria. We\ncould also note the Ebola and Lassa fever outbreaks in\nEuropean countries and, most recently, the SARS\n(severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreaks in Hong\nKong and mainland China, leading rapidly to infection\nin parts of Toronto, wholly as a result of air travel. This\nis dramatic evidence of globalisation, or a borderless\nworld of global relations. It is also a good example of\nnon-linearity and the ability of a small event to trigger\ndisruption on a global scale.\nFurther, there is, quite literally, non-linearity occa-\nsioned by the doubling of airline capacity (doubling the\nnumber of seats means a four-fold increase in opportu-\nnities for disease spread: Haggett, 2001, p. 646). Perhaps\ntoo we can see the change from classical \u2018contagious\u2019 to\n\u2018hierarchical\u2019 to \u2018network\u2019 diffusion in which disease\nspread is both rapid and web-like? Buchanan (2002,\np. 181) notes that some \u2018aristocratic\u2019 networks (where\nthere are a few highly connected people) do not need a\nthreshold or tipping point. Such networks \u2018do not\npossess an epidemic threshold below which diseases\ncannot produce a major epidemic outbreak or the onset\nof an endemic state. [These] networks are therefore\nprone to the spreading and the persistence of infections,\nwhatever virulence the infective agent might possess\u2019.\nThe implication is that the \u2018connectors\u2019 have to be\ntargeted. In other words, change the structure of the\nnetwork and the spread is halted. This was very much\nthe argument in Peter Gould\u2019s work on HIV\/AIDS\n(1993). Gould shows very clearly how HIV is \u2018traffic\u2019 on\na structure or \u2018backcloth\u2019 formed by relations among\nhuman actors; \u2018to stop the HIV traffic transmission you\nhave to break the connections and so fragment the\nbackcloth\u2019 (Gould, 1993, p. 33; see also Baraba\u00b4si, 2002,\npp. 123\u2013142; Buchanan, 2002, pp. 170\u2013183).\nAt a regional and local scale, the existence of a\n\u2018tipping point\u2019 is crucial in whether a disease becomes an\nepidemic. For example, Buchanan (2002, p. 163) refers\nto the epidemic of syphilis in Baltimore in 1995. \u2018One\ninfection may have been triggering, on average, just less\nthan one other infection, and so the disease was keeping\nitself in check. But then crack cocaine, a few less\ndoctors, and the dislocation of a localised community\nout into the larger city pushed the disease over the\nedge\u2014it tipped, and these little factors made a very big\ndifference\u2019. However, surely we need to understandbetter the \u2018upstream\u2019 factors\u2014why the doctors were cut,\nwhy crack cocaine was being used, why people were\nremoved from their homes, and so on; surely some\nfurther social theorising is required? This is provided in\nthe Wallaces\u2019 accounts and suggests some potentially\nfruitful integration between spatial diffusion and health\ninequalities research trajectories.\nDisease ecology and \u2018re-emerging diseases\u2019\nAlbrecht et al. (1998, p. 73) argue, in their \u2018pitch\u2019 for\ncomplexity, that: \u2018The interaction of host and parasite,\nthe role of vectors, the host\u2019s state of health, genetic\npredisposition, standards of hospital infection control,\nthe way humans produce food and a multitude of social\nfactors will all have some influence on disease out-\ncomes\u2019. They refer to a study of Japanese encephalitis in\nnorthern Thailand, which illustrates \u2018the characteristic\nin complex systems of interactive causality among\npeople, the mosquito, the virus, domestic animals, and\nintroduced technology\u2019 (Albrecht et al., 1998, p. 72).\nClearly, in the light of statements such as these we need\nto develop further the connections between the complex-\nity agenda and the disease ecology tradition that pre-\ndates it by several decades (Meade & Earickson, 2000:\nChapter 2; Levins & Lopez, 1999). Mayer (2000, p. 937)\nnotes that a key principle of disease ecology is that\n\u2018population, society and both the physical and biological\nenvironments are in dynamic equilibrium\u2019. But a key\nfeature of CT is that systems may be far from\nequilibrium (Table 1), in which case we need, as Mayer\nargues, a good understanding of the impact that land-\nuse change, climate change, population turnover, and so\non have on population health. In particular, the\nemergence and resurgence of particular diseases needs\nto be set in the wider context of changes that are\neconomic, political and social, as well as environmental.\nA good example would be Lyme disease, where \u2018[t]he\nchain of events that have led to the emergence and\nrecognition of Lyme disease in New England is complex\u2019\n(Mayer, 2000, p. 942). It is, Mayer argues, \u2018reductionist\u2019\nto suggest that the \u2018cause\u2019 of Lyme disease is to be found\nsimply in a good understanding of the pathogen\ninvolved. But to take other examples (such as TB and\nHIV\/AIDS) we need to develop a better understanding\nof the links between population health and the processes\nof globalisation. Among these processes Mayer gives\nprominence to those of population movement.\nSimilar views are expressed by the Harvard Working\nGroup on New and Resurgent Diseases (1996, p. 170):\n\u2018if one lesson has emerged from the spectacular failure of\nWestern medicine to eradicate certain diseases, it is that\ndiseases cannot be reduced to a single cause or explained\nwithin a prevailing linear scientific method: complexity\nis their hallmark\u2019. I think we need to carve out research\nagendas that fuse globalisation debates, disease ecology\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nA.C. Gatrell \/ Social Science & Medicine 60 (2005) 2661\u201326712668and complexity theory, informed by imaginative empiri-\ncal work.\nComplexity and risk\nA good case can be made for taking a complexity\napproach to global system shocks (technological risk).\nNuclear and other localised technological accidents can\nhave global consequences (Chernobyl or Three Mile\nIsland are obvious examples). In other cases, the health\nimpacts of other disasters are contained or more\nlocalised, though nonetheless potentially devastating at\nthat scale. For example, radioactive contamination from\nSellafield is thought by some to have given rise to\nlocalised leukaemia clusters (though this remains a\ncontentious theory), while the Bhopal disaster in India\nhad a local and regional impact on thousands of people,\nmostly the poor living in the vicinity of the plant\n(Gatrell, 2002, Chapter 7). Health risks are not\nnecessarily global but may be locally, regionally or\nperhaps nationally contained; distance is not yet dead.\nThe 2001 foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in the UK\nwas a monumental upheaval to the British agricultural\nand countryside system. It resulted from one tiny \u2018blip\u2019\nin the constant movement of cattle to abattoirs, a blip\nthat nonetheless carried the infection from one farm to a\nmarket from whence the disease spread rapidly. Again, it\nis the movement (flow) that matters, a set of relations\nthat involves hybrids of human and non-human actors.\nLoss of income to farmers and those institutions and\nbusinesses sustaining the farming community, together\nwith the tourist sector, were all unintended conse-\nquences, forcing, in effect, the virtual closure of the\ncountryside (Convery et al., 2005) for about 12 months.\n\u2018This has in part led to a loss of self-esteem, an\nincreasing sense of isolation amongst livestock farmers\nand called into question a \u2018\u2018whole way of life\u2019\u2019 and social\nidentity\u2019 (Convery et al., 2005). In Cumbria, 40 per cent\nof farms were subject to animal culls (rising to 70 per\ncent in the north of the county), with over 1 million\nsheep, 215,000 cattle, and 39,000 pigs slaughtered. The\nscale of slaughter impacted on local sense of identity and\n\u2018on their everyday living and working relations with the\nlandscape, livestock and with others in their commu-\nnityythere was a clear breach of normal relations\u2019\n(Convery et al., 2005, original italics). \u2018Death was in the\nwrong place (the farm rather than the abattoir), but it\nwas also at the wrong time (in relation to the farm\ncalendar) and on the wrong scale (such large-scale\nslaughter seldom occurs at the same time)\u2019 (Convery\net al., 2005).\nSo, a small perturbation can have dramatic conse-\nquences (in this case for the mental health and\npsychological well-being of many rural dwellers), just\nas \u2018countless unorchestrated historical events have left\ntheir traces all over our social and ecological networks,the World Wide Web, and so on\u2019 (Buchanan, 2002,\np. 97).\nOrdinary lives in ordinary places\nGraham Rowles (2000) is interested, and has been for\nover 25 years, in the lives of older people and how these\nare played out in places, particularly in rural Appalachia\n(such as the anonymised rural community of Colton).\nHe seeks to understand both their daily, taken-for-\ngranted, habitual lives and how \u2018they accommodate to\nturning points and transitional events in their lives\u2019\n(Rowles, 2000, p. 53S), appealing to complexity theory\nin the search for this understanding. He looks at the\ndaily routines of older people within their communities\nas \u2018part of a whole, a social ecology that functioned as a\ndelicately balanced homeostatic system\u2019 (Rowles, 2000,\np. 55S). Interestingly, he cites Roger Barker\u2019s ecological\npsychology here and, as an aside, this approach to\npsychology and place is something that geographers in\ngeneral, and health geographers in particular, seem to\nhave missed (Barker, 1968). But Rowles seems keen to\nmove from interesting biographical accounts to \u2018con-\nsider each resident of Colton as immersed in a complex\nsystem of inextricably interrelated actions, relationships,\nand environmental meanings that are in a state of\nhomeostatis. This homeostasis has its own dynamic,\nwith consequences reverberating throughout the system\nwhen any element changes\u2019 (Rowles, 2000, p. 59S).\nThus, the ecology is disrupted when people die or\nbecome ill (and the network of relationships thereby\nchanges). Their lives are \u2018immersed in messy, compli-\ncated, interconnected systems that are not linear, static,\nor absolutely predictable\u2019 (Rowles, 2000, p. 61S). Aside\nfrom wondering what \u2018linear\u2019 means in this context this\nremark seems rather uncontroversial, since all of us live\nlives that have the same characteristics. I am not\nconvinced that our understanding of the mental well-\nbeing of older Appalachian folk is significantly enhanced\nby Rowles\u2019 appeal to complexity theory. I would argue\nthat we gain as much\u2014maybe more\u2014from the time-\nspace geographies that Ha\u00a8gerstrand (1970) proposed,\nlong before complexity theory emerged, and which\nRowles himself cites. Alternatively, very sophisticated\nand engaging accounts of lives lived in particular places\n(for example, Davidson, 2003) have been developed\nwithout a wholly metaphorical use of complexity theory.Missing themes and added value: concluding remarks\nThere must, in principle, be scope for other complex-\nity accounts in the geography of health. Urry (2003,\np. 44) asks us to examine \u2018the complex sets of social\nrelations between the national and the global. They\nconstitute each other\u2019. Thus we need to examine how\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nA.C. Gatrell \/ Social Science & Medicine 60 (2005) 2661\u20132671 2669health profiles and health policies within the nation state\nimpact on global patterns of ill-health, and how\nprocesses operating at the global scale (such as climate\nchange, global spread of infectious disease, or invest-\nment decisions by global companies and international\norganisations) impact nationally. For example, global\nhealth-care organisations (large pharmaceutical compa-\nnies) and global institutions such as the World Bank\nhave major impacts on health-care delivery in particular\ncountries. \u2018Through their interdependence, these institu-\ntions of governance and civil society are organising the\nrules, structures and regulations of the newly emergent\nglobal order\u2019 (Urry, 2003, p. 81). But, set against this,\nand notwithstanding the cross-border flows to seek\nfaster and perhaps better health care abroad, we still\nhave in most of the developed world largely autonomous\nnational health-care policies and structures.\nI think we can claim at least three missing \u2018elements\u2019\nin CT accounts. First, the human voice seems to be\nmissing from much of the complexity theory. The\nqualitative is there, but in the form of qualitative\nstructures and patterns, not in the nature of the\nembodied actor. An exception might be Rowles\u2019 work,\nthough I have argued above that a complexity perspec-\ntive offers relatively little in our understanding of lived\nworlds in small rural communities. Is the behaviour of a\nsmall number of older people in an isolated setting so\nvery complex? Stewart (2001) considers that \u2018[T]he bulk\nof writing on social complexity is decidedly limited in its\nrelation to social relevant philosophical traditions such\nas phenomenology, hermeneutics, psychoanalysis, and\nmodernist retrieval of lived experience in a devastated\nworld\u2019 (Stewart, 2001, p. 334). He bemoans the neglect\nof real lives and actors (real people in contested\nhistory\u2014Stewart, 2001, p. 354). Some complexity\ntheorists appear to agree. As Baraba\u00b4si has it: \u2018The goal\nbefore us is to understand complexity. To achieve that,\nwe must move beyond structure and topology and start\nfocusing on the dynamics that take place along the links.\nNetworks are only the skeleton of complexity, the\nhighways for the various processes that make our world\nhum. To describe society we must dress the links of the\nsocial network with actual dynamical interactions\nbetween people\u2019 (Baraba\u00b4si, 2002, p. 225).\nSecond, gender too seems to be a missing strand from\nexisting uses of CT. Complexity theory appears to be a\nsingularly male enterprise, with women invisible as\nauthors within this particular \u2018invisible college\u2019. I cannot\nexplain why this might be so, and am reminded of an\ninteresting passage in John Fowles\u2019 \u2018complex\u2019 novel, The\nMagus (revised edition, Granada Publishing, London,\n1977):\nMen see objects, women see the relationships\nbetween objects. Whether the objects need each\nother, love each other, match each other. It is anextra dimension of feeling we men are without and\none that makes war abhorrent to all real women\u2014\nand absurd. I will tell you what war is. War is a\npsychosis caused by an inability to see relationships.\nThrift (1999) notes that complexity theory is \u2018heter-\narchical\u2019 rather than hierarchical and for this reason it\nmight be thought to appeal to feminist audiences. It is\npuzzling that few writers in this field are women and\nthat, as yet, complexity theorists have not engaged with\ngender debates.\nThird, I would argue too that, despite assertions of\ninterconnectedness, globalisation, and the linking of\n\u2018everything to everything else\u2019 (Baraba\u00b4si, 2002, p. 7), we\nhave not yet presided over the death of distance.\nTerritory and a sense of identity with particular places\nstill matters. Spatial segregation has health impacts, our\nsocial connections and support at local level still\nmatters, and the connections and relations stressed by\ncomplexity theorists are still very firmly local, at least for\nsome. Those living in affluent countries might be\nexposed to viruses circulating in Africa or elsewhere\n(Haiti, for example, Farmer, 1992, 1999) and such\nviruses may well have impacts that become global in\ntheir reach. But the impact, in terms of disease burden, is\nsurely many times more acute in the poorest regions of\nthe world.\nWe should welcome any considered attempt to\nintroduce new theoretical perspectives into health\ngeography, a field that has been traditionally under-\ntheorised (Litva & Eyles, 1995). However, the success of\ncomplexity theory in the health sciences in general, and\nhealth geography in particular, is not yet assured. \u2018For\nexample, in biology a reductionist molecular approach\n(typified by the human genome project) still holds away\u2019\n(Thrift, 1999, p. 39). The same point might be made of\nrandomised controlled trials in medical and health\nresearch and in many of the geographies of health that\nwe write that rely on (largely regression-based) methods\nthat are reductionist in nature.\nIf health geographers are to engage seriously with CT,\nwe need to move beyond purely metaphorical uses and\nto conduct empirical work that genuinely uses its\nconcepts in a rigorous way. One cannot help avoiding\nthe conclusion that it is easier to talk about complex\ninteracting systems, emergence and non-linearity than to\nknuckle down and do useful empirical research on such\nsystems. Haggett\u2019s comment that \u2018one can do little with\nthe unique except contemplate its uniqueness\u2019 (Haggett,\n1965, p. 3) is equally true of some invocations of\ncomplexity. There is a clear need to move beyond the\ncasual use of metaphor and to explore further the\nadded value of CT for our research in disease\necology, health inequalities and spatial diffusion, all\ntraditional\u2014and still critically important\u2014areas in\nhealth geography.\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nA.C.
