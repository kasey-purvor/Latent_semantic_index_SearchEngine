Introduction\nPrevious studies have raised the possibility of using SL observations to diagnose the\nNorth Atlantic MOC. In response to a diminished MOC, both Levermann et al. [2005]\nand Vellinga and Wood [2007] find that SL rises in the North Atlantic reducing the north-\nsouth SL gradient associated with the primarily zonal North Atlantic Current (NAC).\nLanderer et al. [2007] also finds that average SL rises in the North Atlantic in response to\nan MOC slowdown, but as part of a more complex tri-pole pattern which is attributed to\na northward shift in the NAC. This conflicts with [Hakkinen, 2001] who finds SL decreases\nalong the path of the NAC due to decreased heat advection by a weakened MOC. These\nresults, while showing the potential of SL as an indicator of MOC variability, also point\nto the difficulty of untangling the many ways a changing MOC may affect regional SL\nvariability.\nAccording to geostrophy, a more direct relationship exists between the MOC, or, more\nprecisely, the zonal integral of the meridional transport (MT) at a given latitude, and the\npressure difference between the east and west boundaries. In fact, in an eddy permitting\nocean model, Bingham and Hughes [2008] (henceforth BH) find that north of the Gulf\nStream (at 42\u25e6N) the eastern boundary pressure can be neglected such that the interannual\nMT variability within a given depth interval is closely approximated by:\nT \u2248 \u2212 1\n\u03c10f0\n\u222b z1\nz2\npwdz, (1)\nwhere pw is the bottom pressure (BP) anomaly on the western boundary, \u03c10 is the mean\ndensity of seawater, and f0 is the Coriolis parameter. (Although somewhat counter-\nD R A F T December 10, 2008, 2:50pm D R A F T\nX - 4 BINGHAM ET AL.: MOC SEA LEVEL SIGNATURE\nintuitive, a depth-integral of BP is reasonable since the ocean boundaries have finite\ngradients so BP is defined at every depth.)\nOf course, BP is not as readily observed as SL. This leads us to consider in this letter\nthe relationship between BP and SL along the North Atlantic western boundary. We show\nhow in the eddy-permitting ocean model OCCAM SL on the shelf is closely related to\nthe western boundary BP signal and can therefore be used to determine interannual MT\nvariability. Observational evidence is presented showing how interannual fluctuations in\ncoastal SL north of the Gulf Stream tend to be meridionally coherent, consistent with the\nmodel results. This leads us to conclude that North American coastal SL may indeed be\na useful indicator of MOC variability.\n2. MOC and coastal sea level in OCCAM\n[Bingham et al., 2007] have shown that in OCCAM interannual MOC variability north of\nthe Gulf Stream is dominated by single overturning cell with an upper layer above 1300m\nbalanced by a lower layer from 1300m to about 3000m. From 1987 this cell gradually\nweakens before beginning a recovery in 1994 that persists over the remainder of the model\nrun. (For details of OCCAM see [Bingham et al., 2007] and references therein.)\nGiven (1), the leading EOF (Empirical Orthogonal Function) of interannual BP vari-\nability along the western boundary of the North Atlantic in OCCAM, Ep, is consistent\nwith the variability of the MOC just described. (Figure 1a and the blue curve in 1e).\nNote how Ep changes sign along the 1300m isobath (the inshore contour in each of the\nmaps) from 35N to the northern limit of the analysis at 55N. The BP amplitude below\n1300m is less than it is above because the upper layer transport is balanced by flow in a\nD R A F T December 10, 2008, 2:50pm D R A F T\nBINGHAM ET AL.: MOC SEA LEVEL SIGNATURE X - 5\nthicker lower layer. (To isolate interannual variability all fields referred to in this paper\nwere filtered by removing the mean seasonal cycle and applying a 13 month box car filter.)\nThe leading EOF of SL variability, Eh, (Figure 1b and the red curve in 1e) also varies\nin phase with the MOC and accounts for over 80% of the SL variability on the shelf north\nof 35\u25e6N (Figure 1d). Like Ep, south of 45\u25e6N, Eh changes sign along the continental slope,\nthough not as definitely. Unlike Ep, the amplitude of Eh over the deep ocean is similar to\nthat on the shelf. Yet, tellingly, it still contributes negligibly to the deep ocean variance.\nThis points to a suppression of baroclinic variability by the continental slope.\nIn OCCAM there is a clear linear relationship between the anomalous MT at 50\u25e6N in the\nupper layer (100-1300m) and coastal SL variability (Figure 2), with a positive (negative)\nSL anomaly of 2cm corresponding to a 1Sv reduction (increase) in transport (the exact\nslope is -0.59 Sv\/cm). This simple linear regression model of anomalous MT in the upper\nlayer as a function of coastal SL captures 85% of the variance.\nAs mentioned previously, BH find that in OCCAM the MT variability in the upper\nlayer is balanced by opposing variability in a lower layer. Therefore, it must be the case\nthat the BP anomaly on the western boundary changes sign at 1300m, the depth of the\ninterface between the two layers. This is seen clearly in Ep (Figure 1a). Assuming that pw\nchanges linearly from some value Pw on the shelf edge at z1 = 100m to zero at z2 = 1300m,\nfrom (1) we obtain\nT \u2248 \u221210\n3Pw\n2\u03c10f0\n= \u221210gh\ncm\nw\n2f0\n\u2248 \u2212h\ncm\nw\n2\nSv (2)\nwhere we have expressed the pressure Pw in terms of an equivalent water thickness in\ncentimetres hcmw using Pw = (\u03c10gh\ncm\nw )\/100 and used the approximate values g = 10ms\n\u22122\nD R A F T December 10, 2008, 2:50pm D R A F T\nX - 6 BINGHAM ET AL.: MOC SEA LEVEL SIGNATURE\nand f0 = 10\n\u22124s\u22121. As Figure 1 reveals, on the shelf, BP expressed in equivalent centimetres\nof water thickness is approximately equal to the change coastal SL. Thus, (2) states that\nfor each sverdrup increase (decrease) in meridional transport, coastal SL falls (rises) by\n2cm, in close agreement with the regression model.\n3. Observed sea level variability\nSo far we have established a close link between interannual MOC and coastal SL vari-\nability in OCCAM. We now seek to provide evidence for this link in reality. For this\npurpose we use altimetry SL anomalies produced by Ssalto\/Duacs and distributed by\nAviso, with support from CNES. We also use monthly mean tide gauge (TG) records\nfrom the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) to which we applied an inverse\nbarometer (IB) correction. Within the latitude range 40\u201355\u25e6N, excluding those in the St\nLawrence river which is not resolved by OCCAM, we found 21 records (inverted triangles\nin Figure 3a and specified in Figure 4b) covering the 1985 to 2003 period spanned by\nthe OCCAM run. As before, both sets of data were filtered to isolate the interannual\nvariability.\nThe spatial pattern of the leading EOF, Ea, of the detrended altimetry timeseries (Fig-\nures 3a and 3b), is in many respects similar to Eh (Figure 1b). SL on the shelf varies\ncoherently and is in (out of) phase with SL in the deep ocean north (south) of 45\u25e6N. Also\nin agreement with OCCAM, Ea accounts for the majority of the variability on the shelf\nbut little in the interior. However, on the shelf, Ea does not prevail as completely as does\nEh. This may reflect the reduced coastal performance of altimetry, or the absence of some\nsmall scale processes from OCCAM, or both.\nD R A F T December 10, 2008, 2:50pm D R A F T\nBINGHAM ET AL.: MOC SEA LEVEL SIGNATURE X - 7\nThe spatial function of the leading TG EOF, Et, provides further evidence for a merid-\nionally coherent mode of SL variability along the North American east coast (Figure 3c,\nred). The amplitude of Et tends to decrease poleward, as does the fraction of the total\nvariance it accounts for. Yet, Et still accounts for more then 50% of the variance between\nAtlantic City at 39\u25e6N to Lower Escuminac at 47\u25e6N (black and grey inverted triangles\nin Figure 3a). Repeating the analysis using an equivalent set of data from OCCAM we\nobtain a leading EOF, Eoct , whose spatial form resembles that of Et. However, whereas\nEt only accounts for a small part of the variance at the four most northerly stations,\nEoct accounts for the majority of the variance at these stations. Again, this suggests that\nOCCAM misses some smaller scale influences on SL at these locations.\nThe greatest difference between OCCAM and the observations of coastal SL lie in their\ntemporal evolution. Et and E\noc\nt show a similar decline in coastal SL from a high in 1986\/87\nto a low in 1989\/90 (see Figure 3d). Then, according to Et, coastal SL rises between 1990\nand 1994 before falling again by several centimetres. Coastal SL in OCCAM also shows\nsomething of a rise and fall over this period but it is much less pronounced. After 1994,\nthe evolution of coastal sea level in OCCAM differs markedly from reality. Most notably,\nthe abrupt rise in sea level during 1995\/96 followed by a similarly steep fall during 1998\nis captured by both Et and Ea, but does not occur in OCCAM. We return to a possible\nreason for this discrepancy in Section 4.\nFrom Figure 3c we see that the coherent SL mode is most clearly expressed at 10 TGs\nfrom New York to Yarmouth (black inverted triangles in Figure 3a). Given the consistency\nof these records (see Figure 4a), an estimate of past variability of the coherent mode of\nD R A F T December 10, 2008, 2:50pm D R A F T\nX - 8 BINGHAM ET AL.: MOC SEA LEVEL SIGNATURE\ncoastal SL is given by their composite (Figure 4b). We see that the 1995\/96 SL fluctuation\nis fairly typical of the variability of SL along the North American coast, which has a\nrange of 10cm peak to peak, and a standard deviation of 2.5cm. Note the generally poor\ncorrespondence between changes in coastal SL and anomalous sea surface temperature\n[Rayner et al., 2003] on the shelf averaged over the latitude range spanned by the TGs\n(Figure 4, blue curve). This supports our view that interannual coastal SL variability is\ngenerally not steric.\n4. Discussion and conclusions\nIn OCCAM, interannual MOC variability is well determined by BP on the western\nboundary. And since the western boundary BP is closely related to SL on the shelf, MOC\nvariations can be inferred from SL alone using a linear relationship of 2cm\/Sv. MOC\nrelated SL variations have a particular spatial pattern, constrained by topography, and\nmeridionally coherent. The similarity between the leading SL EOFs from the model and\nfrom altimetry suggest similar underlying dynamics. If so, the abrupt rise of coastal SL\nduring 1994-96 reflects an sudden but temporary slowdown of the MOC. In support of\nthis, Hakkinen [2001] describe an abrupt slowdown of the MOC during this period in their\nmodel. Yet, OCCAM fails to reproduce this abrupt change. This may be because the\nmodel has not reached full equilibrium due to a short spin-up period of only four years,\nresulting from the computational demands of running a high resolution model.\nWithout the full spatial information provided by altimetry, we can be less certain of\nMOC inferences based on the TG data. However, for the altimetry period, the TG records\nare dominated by the meridionally coherent mode of SL seen in the altimetry data. In\nD R A F T December 10, 2008, 2:50pm D R A F T\nBINGHAM ET AL.: MOC SEA LEVEL SIGNATURE X - 9\naddition, the coherent nature of the interannual SL fluctuations over many decades is\nclear. If we assume the underlying spatial pattern given by altimetry then the interannual\nfluctuations seen in the composite TG record primarily reflect MOC variability, then\nusing the 2cm\/Sv relationship given by OCCAM we can estimate of the likely range of\ninterannual MOC variability to have a standard deviation of 1.25Sv, with changes of up\nto 5Sv occurring over a few years.\nHowever, caution is required in applying our simple relationship between MOC strength\nand coastal SL at longer timescales since it is not clear if the assumption that BP vari-\nability on the eastern boundary is negligible will remain sound. On the one hand, results\nfrom Greatbatch and Peterson [1996] (Figs. 3 and 4) and Landerer et al. [2007] (Figs. 3\nand 6) suggests that western boundary pressure remains dominant. On the other hand,\nit is possible that significant pressure changes across the basin may be caused by eustatic\nchanges in SL due to mass fluxes or by circulation changes. This is illustrated by Lever-\nmann et al. [2005] where SL (and by inference BP) is seen to increase on both east and\nwest coasts due to MOC slowdown. Because the SL change is uniform across the basin it\nis not directly associated with changes in meridional transport, but under our assumption\nof zero change on the eastern boundary it would be interpreted as such. (This explains\nwhy Levermann et al. [2005] find a 5cm\/Sv relationship between MOC strength coastal\nSL, much larger than our 2cm\/Sv rate. Differencing their east and west coast SL values\ngives a dependency closers to ours.) Ocean warming may also lead to global SL changes\nwithout a corresponding BP change. Therefore, further work is need to establish to what\nextent our relationship holds at longer timescales.\nD R A F T December 10, 2008, 2:50pm D R A F T\nX - 10 BINGHAM ET AL.: MOC SEA LEVEL SIGNATURE\nHaving said this, unless balanced by a factor causing a drop in coastal SL, we would\nexpect an 8Sv MOC reduction between 1950 and 2004, as claimed by Bryden et al. [2005],\nto have some signature in SL. Under our interpretation it would imply a 16cm rise in\ncoastal SL, and even more according to Levermann et al. [2005]. Yet, our composite TG\nrecord of SL has a small downward trend, amounting to a 1cm drop over the same period.\nInterestingly, the implied slight increase in overturning of 0.5Sv is in line with a number\nof other recent studies [e.g Wu et al., 2004].\nAcknowledgments.
