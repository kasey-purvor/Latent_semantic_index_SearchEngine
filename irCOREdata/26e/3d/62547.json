Previous work on Antarctic fish \nhas shown that they lack the classical heat shock response: with the inducible \nform of HSP70 being permanently expressed with expression not further \ninduced under higher temperature regimes. This study shows that this is not \nthe case for other Antarctic animals, with the two molluscs showing an \ninducible heat shock response, at a level probably set during their temperate \nevolutionary past. \n 2\nHSP Antarctic molluscs \nIntroduction \n \nAll organisms are adapted to life within a constrained environmental \nenvelope, with consequential specialisations in ecology, physiology and \nbiochemistry. Associated with these adaptations, is a species-specific capacity \nto cope with environmental change. If an organism is taken outside of its \n\u201cnormal\u201d environmental envelope by, for example, changing temperature, \nsalinity or oxygen availability, the organism becomes vulnerable, a situation \ngenerically described as stress. In turn, this environmental challenge triggers \na biochemical response, the aim of which is to counteract or mitigate any \npotential cell damage caused by the environmental insult, and to enhance \nsurvival.  \n \nAt the molecular level, the production of stress proteins (reviewed in Gross \n2004) such as the heat shock proteins (HSPs), is regarded as a classical \nresponse. These are a family of highly conserved proteins, which act as \nchaperones to stabilise and refold  denatured proteins,  preventing the \nformation of cytotoxic aggregates (Parsell & Lindquist 1993, Hartl 1996, Fink \n1999). Numerous families of heat shock proteins have been identified, the \nnaming of which is related to their weight in kiloDaltons. The most studied of \nthese family members are the 70kD heat shock proteins (HSP70s), comprising \nconstitutive (HSC70: heat shock cognate 70), stress inducible (HSP70s: heat \nshock protein 70) and glucose regulated forms (GRP78: glucose regulated \nprotein 78kD). Whilst their action has been described in response to a wide \n 3\nHSP Antarctic molluscs \nvariety of stresses, the classical activation of the inducible HSP70 genes is in \nresponse to elevated environmental temperatures and is tightly controlled by \nthe heat shock transcription factor (HSF1) (Reviewed in Morimoto 1998).  \n \nThe classic heat shock response involving a strong up-regulation of HSP70 \nproduction has been demonstrated in all organisms examined to date with the \nexception of Hydra oligactis (Bosch et al 1988), an Antarctic ciliate Euplotes \nfocardii (La Terza et al 2001, 2004) and several species of Antarctic \nnotothenioid fish (Place & Hofmann 2005). However, the fish case is complex. \nThree distantly related Antarctic species, Trematomus bernacchii, Pagothenia \nborchgrevinki and Lycodichthys dearborni   permanently express the inducible \nform of HSP70 (Place & Hofmann 2005) but the Nototheniidae lack the ability \nto further up-regulate this gene in response to elevated environmental \ntemperatures (Place et al 2004, Buckley et al 2004). Given these data, the \nquestion arises as to whether the permanent expression of HSP70 and lack of \na heat shock response in Antarctic Notothenioids is family-specific, and\/or a \nconsequence of adaptation to highly stable, cold Antarctic seawater \ntemperatures and could therefore be a general phenomenon extending to \nother non-piscine Antarctic marine organisms.  \n \nAntarctic invertebrates are in general as stenothermal, and in some cases \nmore stenothermal than the endemic fish species (Somero & DeVries 1967; \nPeck & Conway 2000) with many species having survivable temperature \nenvelopes between 5\u00b0C and 12\u00b0C above the minimum sea temperature of  \n 4\nHSP Antarctic molluscs \n\u20131.86\u00b0C (Peck 2002). Even within this temperature range, animals start to \nlose critical biological functions such as swimming (scallops), righting \nresponses (limpets) and reburying (clams) (Peck et al 2004), all of which are \nlost with temperature elevations of only 1-2\u00b0C above current summer \nmaximum seawater temperatures (0-1.8\u00b0C). Many Antarctic invertebrates, \nincluding the groups mentioned above, die at temperatures below +10\u00baC \n(Peck 1989; Peck et al 2002; P\u00f6rtner 2002). Shallow seawater temperatures \nalong the west Antarctic Peninsula have risen in excess of 1\u00b0C over the last \n50 years (Meredith & King 2005). While the IPCC Third Assessment climate \nmodel (2001) predicts  a further 2oC increase in global seawater temperatures \nover the next 100 years, albeit with large regional variations and confidence \nintervals.  In light of current and predicted seawater temperature increases \nAntarctic stenotherms are therefore at considerable future risk of seasonal \nexposure to ambient water temperatures that exceed those known to result in \nthe loss of critical biological functions (Peck et al 2004).  \n \nIn this study members of the HSP70 gene family comprising the constitutive \n(HSC70) and inducible (HSP70) members, plus GRP78 (Glucose-regulated \nprotein, 78kDa) a related HSP70 family member were cloned using \ndegenerate PCR from two evolutionary divergent Antarctic marine molluscs \n(Laternula elliptica (a bivalve) and Nacella concinna (a gastropod)). L. elliptica \nis a sediment burrowing mollusc, whereas N. concinna is a common inter-tidal \nspecies and can be found anywhere from mid-tide level (Walker 1972) to \ndepths greater than 110m depth (Powell 1951, 1973). The N. concinna  used \n 5\nHSP Antarctic molluscs \nin this study were collected by divers at 8-10m depths. Given these collection \ndistributions, both species experience yearly water temperatures restricted \nbetween \u20131.86\u00b0C and +1\u00b0C. The expression of the HSP70 family members \nwas assessed using Q-PCR after an acute two-hour heat shock experiment. \nThe data are discussed within the context of adaptation to life in an extreme \nand changing environment. \n \n 6\nHSP Antarctic molluscs \nMethods \n \nAnimal sampling and experimental work  \n \nAll animals used in experimental work were collected at Rothera Research \nStation, Adelaide Island, Antarctic Peninsula (67o 34\u05f3 07\u05f4 S, 68o 07\u05f3 30\u05f4 W) by \nSCUBA divers during the austral summer at depths of 10-15m (L. elliptica) \nand 6m (N. concinna). Seasonal water temperatures for this collection site are \nprovided in Figure 1. Laternula elliptica (bivalve) and Nacella concinna \n(gastropod) were collected and immediately returned to the laboratory where \nthey were maintained in a through-flow aquarium under a simulated natural \nlight:dark cycle. Predicted sunrise and sunset times (POLTIPS 3, Proudman \nOceanographic Laboratory) were used in conjunction with a mechanical timer \nto control the lighting regime. During the time the animals were held in the \naquarium the water temperature was 0.75\u00b10.0oC. All experimental work was \ncarried out in January 2004. L. elliptica and N. concinna were not fed when \nheld in the aquarium, but the former were observed filtering seawater in the \ntanks and would have obtained some food via this route, while the latter were \nobserved grazing biofilms on the aquarium tanks. Animals were maintained \nfor 5-7 days in the aquarium prior to experimental work.  \n \nThe two species were exposed to a thermal shock, by immediate transfer to \nseawater maintained at a range of temperatures (1.33\u00b10.07oC (control), \n4.8\u00b10.06\u00b0C, 6.0\u00b10.03\u00b0C, 8.12\u00b10.05\u00b0C, 10.16\u00b10.07oC, 14.9\u00b10.0oC and \n 7\nHSP Antarctic molluscs \n20.09\u00b10.04oC (N. concinna only)) for 2 hours. Groups of 5 animals of each \nspecies were transferred to the experimental tanks. After the 2h thermal \nshock the animals were weighed (\u00b1 0.1g), shell length measured (\u00b10.1mm), \nkilled and tissues collected and placed either in RNALater (Ambion) or snap \nfrozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent analysis. Tissue samples were \ncollected from the foot of N. concinna, and gill, foot muscle, digestive gland, \ngonad, mantle and siphon from L. elliptica.  \n \nSample Analysis \n \nRNA extraction and isolation of Heat Shock Protein (HSP) genes: Total RNA \nwas extracted from tissues using TRI Reagent (Sigma) according to the \nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions. 1\u03bcg of total RNA was DNAse treated using 0.4U \nDNase I (Ambion) in 10mM DTT\/100mM MgCl2 buffer and reverse transcribed \nusing a first strand synthesis kit (Promega). Degenerate primers for HSP70 \nwere designed from a protein alignment of HSP70 genes from a variety of \nspecies (H. sapiens to molluscs) The primers (HSP70F: \nATCATCGCYAACGACCAGGGMRAC; HSP70R: \nGTTGTTGAAGTARGCDGGSACBGT) amplified a 500 bp fragment \nencompassing amino acids 30-125 (motifs used for primers: IIANDQGD and \nTVPAYFNN). PCR cycling conditions varied according to the organism: \nL.elliptica: 95\u00b0C 5 minutes, 35 cycles of 95\u00b0C 20 seconds, 55\u00b0C 20 seconds \nand 72\u00b0C for 40 seconds with a final elongation step of 72\u00b0C for 5 minutes. \nThe same basic programme was kept for N. concinna  but with the annealing \n 8\nHSP Antarctic molluscs \ntemperature reduced to 45\u00b0C and the number of cycles increased to 40. \nProducts were subcloned into p-GEMT-easy (Promega), transformed into \nE.coli strain XL-2 Blue MRF\u2019 (Stratagene) and a minimum of 48 clones \nsequenced from each organism. Sequence data was assembled using the \nphred, Phrap and consed packages  (Ewing et al 1998, Gordon et al 1998). \nConsensus sequences were database searched using WU-blast2 (WU-blastx) \n(Altschul et al 1997) against Uniprot (Boeckmann et al 2003, Wu et al 2006) \nto assign their HSP identity. The nucleotide sequences were aligned using \nClustal W (Thompson et al 1994) and specific primers designed to each \ndifferent member of the HSP family for each organism, all with an annealing \ntemperature of 60\u00b0C. Amplified fragment sizes varied between 119bp and \n142bp. The specificity of each of the primers was checked, by amplification \nand sequencing of the products. All HSP sequence fragments have been \nsubmitted to the EMBL database with the accession numbers AM293594-\nAM293601 inclusive.  \n \nIsolation of \u03b2 actin genes: For comparative analysis to be made between the \ndifferent HSP genes, a housekeeping sequence \u03b2 actin was isolated from both \norganisms. Degenerate primers were designed from a ClustalW alignment of a \nnumber of  \u03b2 actin genes from Takifugu (Venkatesh et al 1996) two \nAsteroidea and one Orthogastropoda (Accession numbers: P53484, p12716, \np123717 and P17304 respectively) (SeaactinF: \nACCGACTACYTSAKKAAGATCCT; SeaactinR: GAVGCVAGGATGGAGCCRCC). The \nPCR conditions for L. elliptica were as follows: 95\u00b0C 5 minutes, 35 cycles of \n 9\nHSP Antarctic molluscs \n95\u00b0C 20 seconds, 60\u00b0C 20 seconds and 72\u00b0C for 40 seconds with a final \nelongation step of 72\u00b0C for 5 minutes. The same basic programme used for \nN. concinna,  but with a lower annealing temperature of  45\u00b0C  and the \nnumber of cycles increased to 40. PCR products were sequenced, assembled \nand checked as described above for the HSP genes. In this instance, if \nmultiple \u03b2 actin fragments were amplified from the same organism, primers \nwere designed to regions of identity between the different family members. \nPrimers were designed to anneal at 60\u00b0C. Expression levels of \u03b2 actin \nbetween different tissues and different treatment states were checked to \nensure constant expression and reproducibility. Sequences of all primers are \nlisted in Table 1.  \n \nQ PCR: HSP and actin sequences were amplified from each organism under \neach treatment condition using specific primers, Brilliant SYBR\u00ae Green QPCR \nMaster Mix (Stratagene) and an MX3000P (Stratagene). PCR conditions were \nas follows: 95\u00b0C 10 minutes, 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C 30 seconds, 60\u00b0C 1 minute \nand 72\u00b0C for 1 minute with a final dissociation curve step as per \nmanufacturers recommendations. The plate set-up for each Q-PCR \nexperiment consisted of 5 control individuals and 5 experimental (\u201ctreated\u201d) \nindividuals, both sets were amplified with a specific HSP primer pair and an \nactin control primer set.  All amplifications were reproduced in triplicate. Each \nprimer set was checked to ensure that no primer dimers were produced \nduring the course of the amplification reaction. RSq values and PCR \nefficiencies were checked over a four fold 10x dilution series and the values \n 10\nHSP Antarctic molluscs \ncalculated using the MxPro - MX3000P v 3.00 Build 311 Schema 74 software \n(Table 1). Primers producing low RSq values were discarded and new primers \ndesigned. Amplifications were analysed using the MxPro - MX3000P v 3.00 \nBuild 311 Schema 74 software and Ct (dR) values exported into Excel. \nRelative expression ratios of the HSP genes compared to the actin \nhousekeeping genes between the control and treated samples were derived \nusing the Relative Expression Software Tool (REST) (http:\/\/www.gene-\nquantification.info\/)  (Pfaffl 2001, Pfaffl et al 2002). This is an excel macro \nthat incorporates both a mathematical model to calculate relative expression \nratios on the basis of the PCR efficiency and crossing point derivation of the \ninvestigated samples and a two sided  Pair Wise Fixed Reallocation \nRandomisation Test. This test makes no assumptions about distribution (such \nas normality of distribution) and assumes that treatments were randomly \nallocated. The randomisation test repeatedly and randomly reallocates the \nobserved values to the two groups and notes the apparent effect (expression \nratio). The proportion of these effects, which are as great as that actually \nobserved in the experiment provides the p-value of the test. 2000 \nrandomisations were used in the test  (Pfaffl 2001, Pfaffl et al 2002). These \nresults were then followed by further statistical analysis  (MINITAB v 14) \nusing a 2-way ANOVA to test for the significance of an effect of either \ntemperature or tissue. \n \n \n \n 11\nHSP Antarctic molluscs \nResults \nFour members of the HSP70 gene family were isolated from both L. elliptica \nand N. concinna. These were defined according to their sequence similarity \nscores after searching the sequence databases using WU-blastx. In each \nanimal these comprised two members of the inducible form (HSP70, \ndesignated HSP70A and HSP70B), one heat shock cognate HSC70 gene and \none for glucose-regulated protein, 78kDa (GRP78) (Table 2). Meaningful \nphylogenetic comparisons were not possible as there are only two other \nsequences for mollusc GRP78 and HSC70 genes in the public databases. \n \nN. concinna: Initially to obtain a general idea of the relative expression levels \nof each of the HSP genes in N. concinna, the genes were assayed using \nstandard PCR and gel electrophoresis in a set of control animals (Figure 2). \nBoth inducible forms of the HSP70 genes were present, but at a relatively low \nlevel. In contrast, GRP78 was more strongly expressed, by approximately two \nfold, but the constitutive HSC70 gene was very strongly expressed, at a level \nsimilar to that of the \u03b2 actin gene. Neither HSC70 nor GRP78 showed any \nsignificant change in gene expression levels assessed using Q-PCR after \nexposure to 10\u00b0C, 15\u00b0or 20\u00b0C. Although both HSP70 genes showed no \nsignificant change in level at 10\u00b0C, there was massive up-regulation of both \ngenes at 15\u00b0C and 20\u00b0C. HSP70A was up regulated by almost 2000 fold at \nboth temperatures, whilst HSP70B was up-regulated by approximately 350 \nfold at 15\u00b0C, which increased to almost 750 fold at 20\u00b0C (Figure 3). A two \nway ANOVA on the combined dataset showed both a significant difference \n 12\nHSP Antarctic molluscs \nbetween genes (F3,6 = 8.10, p = 0.016) and an effect of temperature (F2,6 = \n5.38, p = 0.046). Partitioning the dataset (into HSP70 A and B; GRP78 and \nHSC70) and reanalysing shows that with the inducible HSP70s there is no \neffect of gene (F1,2 = 0.81, p = 0.462) but there is an effect of temperature  \n(F2,2 = 29.97, p = 0.032), as evidenced by the massive up regulation of these \ngenes, whilst with GRP78 and HSC70 there is no effect of either gene (F1,2 = \n0.12, p = 0.76) or temperature (F2,2 = 0.70, p = 0.590). \n \nL. elliptica: This mollusc was originally assayed for HSP expression across a \nrange of five tissues (gill, digestive gland, mantle, foot and siphon) in control \nanimals. Gonad tissue was not included in the heat shock evaluation since \nheat is one method of inducing spawning in a number of marine organisms \nand as such, this would influence gene expression in this tissue. In L. elliptica, \nboth inducible forms of the HSP70 gene were permanently expressed with \nHSP70A expressed more strongly and uniformly than HSP70B. HSP70B \nshowed tissue-specific expression levels with highest expression in mantle, \nfollowed by gut and very low levels in the foot, gill and siphon. GRP78 was \nfairly uniformly expressed at approximately 2-3 fold higher levels than the \nHSP70A gene. (Figure 4). The gene designated as HSC70 showed a very low \nlevel of expression, which did not change appreciably after the heat shock \ntreatment. Therefore the data for this gene, whilst surveyed across all \ntemperature ranges and tissues has not been included in this analysis.  \n \n 13\nHSP Antarctic molluscs \nSamples were sequentially analysed starting from the highest temperature of \n15\u00b0C and then surveyed at lower temperatures if the genes showed up \nregulation. Hence some tissues were checked at the lower temperatures of \n6\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C.  \n \nAll three genes (HSP70A, HSP70B and GRP78) under study appeared to show \nincreased expression levels in response to temperature. The relative \nexpression levels of HSP70A showed a significant response to temperature \n(F2,8 = 25.30, p = <0.001) and an effect of tissue specificity at the 10% level \n(F4,8 = 2.91, p = 0.093). This gene showed up regulation from 10\u00b0C. The \nmaximum increase in relative expression of this gene was approximately 12x \n(Figure 5). HSP70B exhibited higher maximal expression levels, up 86x \n(Figure 6). There was relatively uniform expression in all tissues at both 15\u00b0C \nand 10\u00b0C as evidenced by the ANOVA results (F4,4 = 0.30, p = 0.862), with a \nsignificant effect of temperature (F1,4 = 23.97, p = 0.008). The survey of \ntissues at 8\u00b0C showed significant relative expression in both foot and gill \n(according to the individual p values).  Foot muscle was further surveyed at \nlower temperatures and showed no appreciable up regulation (Figure 6). \nWhen the whole 8\u00b0C dataset is combined with that from 10\u00b0C and 15\u00b0C and \nsubjected to a 2-way ANOVA, the seemingly tissue-specific nature of the \nresponse at this lower temperature masks the effects of both tissue and \ntemperature (F4,8 = 0.81, p = 0.550; F2,8 = 2.34, p = 0.158) respectively. \nTherefore, it is only possible to say that HSP70B is statistically significantly up \nregulated at 10\u00b0C. In the case of GRP78, there appeared to be differences in \n 14\nHSP Antarctic molluscs \ntissue-specific expression levels and a potentially higher uniform induction \nthreshold of 15\u00b0C (Figure 7). A 2-way ANOVA test on the 8-15\u00b0C dataset \nproduced no significant result for either tissue or temperature (F4,8 = 0.68, p \n= 0.626; F2,8 = 2.28, p = 0.165) respectively. Individual p values indicate that \nsignificant up regulation of expression occurs in gill, mantle and siphon (p \nvalues of 0.48, 0.002 and 0.008 respectively) at 15\u00b0C, however a 2-way \nANOVA test on the restricted 10-15\u00b0C dataset do not show an overall effect of \neither tissue or temperature (F4,4 = 1.69, p = 0.312; F1,4 = 3.15, p = 0.150). \nFoot tissue showed the highest expression at 8\u00b0C and so was surveyed at \nlower temperatures, but no up regulation was indicated (Figure 7). \n \n \nDiscussion \n \nBoth Antarctic marine molluscs in this study possess a quantifiable heat shock \nresponse, which varies both in magnitude between the two species \n(maximum 2000-fold in N. concinna, but only 40-fold in L. elliptica) and also \nin induction temperature. N. concinna exhibits a massive heat shock response \nat 15\u00b0C, whilst  the up-regulation threshold for L. elliptica is statistically \nsignificant from 10\u00b0C depending on the gene.  \n \nFour genes, HSP70A, HSP70B, HSC70 and GRP78 were cloned from each of \nthe two animals. The two inducible forms of HSP70 are very similar: the two \nN. concinna genes are 78.2% identical, whilst the two L. elliptica genes are \n 15\nHSP Antarctic molluscs \n70.2% identical, both at the DNA level. The most parsimonious explanation \nfor which is propagation via gene duplication, either a gene-specific or whole \ngenome event.  Each of the HSP70 genes identified in each organism exhibits \ndifferent control levels of gene expression compared to its paralogue in the \nsame organism (in particular HSP70B in L. elliptica  is the subject of tissue \nspecific expression, for further discussion, see below). This is in line with the \nretention and evolution of duplicate genes via sub-functionalisation (Force et \nal 1999) and maintenance of duplicates in this instance may reflect  different \ntissue requirements to protect against low temperature or ice-nuclei insult.  \n \nGRP78 is located in the endoplasmic reticulum and is a classic marker of the \nunfolded protein response with an HSP-like chaperon function (Sommer & \nJarosch 2002, which in mammals is not classically activated in response to \ntemperature (Hendershot et al 1994). However, evidence from both the \nplatyfish and Japanese oyster indicate that in lower vertebrates\/invertebrates, \nit is up regulated in response to temperature (Yamashita et al 2004, \nYokoyama et al 2006). Our experiments substantiate these findings. \n \nIn the experiments with N. concinna  only foot muscle was surveyed. L. \nelliptica is much larger and several different tissues could be dissected and \nexamined. The magnitude of response varied between tissues with some \ntissues showing a statistically significant difference in expression levels of \nsome genes compared to others (cf. gill, mantle and siphon with GRP78). \nCertainly in the control animals, HSP70A showed fairly uniform expression \n 16\nHSP Antarctic molluscs \nlevels across tissues, whilst HSP70B showed some indication of tissue \nspecificity, with high expression in the mantle carried through to the 15\u00b0C \nexperiments. HSP70B shows statistically significant individual results for gill, \nmantle and foot (and siphon at the 10% level) at 15\u00b0C, whilst GRP78 shows \nsignificant up regulation in gill, mantle and siphon at 15\u00b0C. This is perhaps \nnot surprising, as the foot, in particular, is the crucial organ for mobility in this \nanimal and gills present a large surface area in contact with the surrounding \nenvironment and are critical for respiration. The siphon is the only part of the \nanimal, which is in direct contact with flowing seawater when buried and \nwould be the first contact for increased water temperatures. The results for \nmantle are interesting, as this organ is largely responsible for secretion of the \nshell, however, it does enclose the critical respiratory chamber containing the \ngills and is also continuous with the siphon and so maybe it too acts as a first \nresponse to increased seawater temperatures.  \n \n \nWhen examining the HSP response in these animals using Q-PCR, care has to \nbe taken with regard to the change in relative gene expression as an absolute \nfigure, rather than looking at the data overall and extracting general trends. \nThis is because repeat sampling of animals before and after treatment was \nnot possible. As a result, this meant that analysis of 5 \u201cpaired\u201d results was in \nfact analysis of ten different individuals, hence the Q-PCR results were highly \nvariable with large Confidence Intervals. Individual variation in gene \nexpression is clearly high and may have been exacerbated by different sized \n 17\nHSP Antarctic molluscs \nanimals being used in each set of experiments (for example in the 10\u00b0C N. \nconcinna cohort, weight varied from 1.3g to 7.1g and in the 10\u00b0C L. elliptica \ncohort weight ranged from 23.7g to 75.8g). Previous work examining \nphysiological responses to increased water temperatures showed a correlation \nof response magnitude with size (Peck & Bailey in review, Peck et al in \nreview) and therefore by inference size may also affect gene expression \nlevels, or at least rate of change. This is clearly a factor, which requires \nfurther investigation for future work, but is impossible to eliminate completely \nas it is not always possible to choose similar sized animals for the experiments \nwhen evaluating animals from extreme environments.  \n \nThe two invertebrates studied demonstrated that they are capable of a heat \nshock response. This is in contrast to Antarctic Notothenioids, which show \npermanent expression of the inducible forms of the HSP70 genes and no heat \nshock response (Hofmann et al 2000, Place et al 2004; Place & Hofmann \n2005). The two mollusc species in this study also show some permanent \nexpression of the inducible forms of the HSP70 genes, albeit at a relatively \nlow level. They also show permanent expression of the HSC70 genes, N. \nconcinna, in particular shows relatively high control levels of HSC70 similar to \nthat of the actin gene. Since the N. concinna foot was used for these \nexperiments, actin would be expected to be one of the major genes \nexpressed. The fact that the HSC70 gene is expressed at a similar level to \nactin, suggests by inference that it is one of the most highly expressed genes \nin this animal. GRP78 is also constitutively expressed at high levels in this \n 18\nHSP Antarctic molluscs \nanimal. Since both HSC70 and GRP78 are expressed at such high level \nconstitutively, this may be the reason why they are not up regulated further \nin N. concinna in response to increased seawater temperatures, particularly \nwhen compared to the situation in L. elliptica where relative control levels of \nGRP78 are lower and HSC70 is poorly expressed. \n \n Taking the data overall: the permanent expression of the inducible HSP70 \ngenes, species-specific high expression of HSC70 (N. concinna) and \npermanent expression of GRP78 (N. concinna and L. elliptica) indicates that \nas for Antarctic fish, chaperone proteins form an essential part of the \nadaptation of biochemical machinery of these Antarctic animals to low but \nstable temperatures. High constitutive levels of HSP gene family member \nexpression may be a compensatory mechanism for coping with elevated \nprotein damage at low temperatures analogous to the permanent expression \nof HSP70 in the Antarctic Notothenioids. There is some evidence that protein \ndegradation rates and protein carbonyl concentrations (as a measure of \nprotein oxidation) appear comparatively higher in invertebrates at polar water \ntemperatures than in species living at warmer temperatures (Fraser et al \n2002, Philipp et al 2005). Other studies have also shown elevated levels of \nubiquitin-conjugated proteins in polar fishes, a likely indication of increased \nlevels of denatured proteins at polar water temperatures (Place et al 2004). \nTaken together this evidence suggests that transcribing, translating and \nfolding proteins at polar water temperatures is problematic. Indeed, cold \ndenaturation of proteins has  previously been documented (Privalov 1990) \n 19\nHSP Antarctic molluscs \nand exposure of endotherm cells and ectotherms to cold shock can induce \nHSP70 expression (Ali et al 2003, Laios et al 1997).  \n \nWhilst both species show constitutive expression of HSP gene family members \nand up-regulation of HSP70 genes, there is a clear difference in the response \nbetween N. concinna and L.elliptica. This may be phylogenetically \nconstrained, but impossible to determine given the limited species sampling. \nCertainly the level may be pre-determined according to the lifestyle of the \norganism. L. elliptica is a sediment burrowing mollusc which experiences a \nseasonal sea temperature range of between \u20131.86\u00b0C to +1.86\u00b0C at Rothera \nPoint (Peck et al 2006) (Figure 1). This species has also been shown to be \none of the most stenothermal Antarctic marine species studied to date with \nan effective temperature tolerance between -2\u00b0C - +2.5\u00b0C, an upper lethal \ntemperature of +7.5\u00b0C and a critical temperature window of 5-7\u00b0C, above \nwhich anaerobiosis starts (Peck et al 2002, 2004, S. Morley, pers comm.). In \ncontrast N. concinna is a common inter-tidal species and can be found \nanywhere from mid-tide level (Walker 1972) to depths greater than 110m \ndepth (Powell 1951, 1973). The N. concinna  used in this study were collected \nby divers at 8-10m depths, where again the yearly water temperature range \nonly varies between \u20131.86\u00b0C and +1\u00b0C. Although data collected during the \naustral summer at South Cove, Rothera Point on inter-tidal limpets \ndemonstrated that on a sunny day, the foot temperature of intertidal N. \nconcinna exceeded 6.3\u00b0C, while the maximum shell temperatures reached \n7.2\u00b0C (C Waller, pers. comm.). According to the current study these foot \n 20\nHSP Antarctic molluscs \ntemperatures are still considerably lower than that required to induce HSP up-\nregulation (15\u00b0C). When examining the threshold for HSP induction in \ntemperate marine organisms, a value of +8-+10\u00b0C over habitat temperature \nis common (Tomanek & Somero 1999, Buckley et al 2001) and therefore the \nthreshold at which HSPs are induced in these two molluscs is similar to the \ntemperature rise required for the normal induction temperature for temperate \nspecies (Hofmann 2005). There are no accurate fossil records for  N. concinna \nin the Antarctic (A Crame, pers comm.), but fossils of L. elliptica have been \ndescribed from the late Pliocene (5Ma) (Soot Ryen 1952, Jonkers 1999) \nHence, these founder animals may have an HSP regulation that evolved in a \nwarmer and more variable climate.  \n \nGiven that the HSP response in these molluscs is induced at typical temperate \nhabitat levels, the question remains as to why the level at which the \nthermostat has been set has not been reduced in line with the very narrow \ntemperature range that these animals currently experience in their natural \nenvironment. Ultimately, there is an energetic cost associated with the \nproduction of heat shock proteins and overproduction may be cytotoxic \n(Feder & Hofmann 1999, Sorensen et al 2003). As both N. concinna and L. \nelliptica constitutively express members of the HSP70 family (HSC70 and \nGRP78: N. concinna and GRP78 L. elliptica) and are permanently investing \nheavily in their production, they may not have the spare energetic capacity \nfor significant up regulation without significant deleterious effects on other \ncellular processes.  \n 21\nHSP Antarctic molluscs \n \nA second explanation may be that the constitutive requirement for the HSP \nfamily to mitigate problems of protein conformity at low temperature \ndecrease with small to moderate elevations in temperature, such as those \nbelow 10\u00b0C. This could either reduce the expression levels somewhat of the \nrelevant genes, or balance any increase in protein unfolding with rising \ntemperature. Eventually the insult from the temperature shock would \noverwhelm the balance and a marked increase in HSP gene expression would \nresult similar to that observed. We currently do not have data to differentiate \nthe competing hypotheses. \n \nIn summary, these results show that in contrast to Antarctic Notothenioids, \ntwo Antarctic molluscs exhibit the classical biochemical-based heat shock \nresponse to elevated environmental temperatures. The level and magnitude \nof the response varies with the species. The level at which this response is \nactivated, under experimental conditions, indicates that control of this \nfunction is probably a relic from temperate ancestors and given the data \npresented here, probably would not be activated under increased seawater \ntemperatures associated with global warming predictions. Therefore, genetic \nfactors other than HSP production might be expected to play a more \nimportant role in the adaptation of these animals to life in higher \ntemperatures, should they survive. A more comprehensive investigation into \nthe complex transcriptional changes that take place in these animals \n 22\nHSP Antarctic molluscs \nassociated with increased environmental temperatures is currently underway \nin our laboratory. \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis paper was produced within the BAS Q3 LATEST and BAS Q4 \nBIOREACH\/BIOFLAME core programmes.
