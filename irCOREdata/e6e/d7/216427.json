The first is the \nattribution of certain characteristics to everyone subsumed within a particular category: \nthe \u2018(all) women are caring and empathetic\u2019, \u2018(all) Africans have rhythm\u2019, \u2019(all) Asians \nare community oriented\u2019 syndrome. The second is the attribution of those characteristics \nto the category, in ways that naturalise or reify what may be socially created or \nconstructed. The third is the invocation of a collectivity as either the subject or object of \npolitical action (\u2018the working class\u2019, \u2018women\u2019, \u2018Third World women\u2019), in a move that \nseems to presume a homogenised and unified group. The fourth is the policing of this \ncollective category, the treatment of its supposedly shared characteristics as the defining \nones that cannot be questioned or modified without undermining an individual\u2019s claim to \nbelong to that group. Focusing on these four variants enables us to see that the issue is \nsometimes one of degree rather than a categorical embargo.  \n \n 2 \n \nWork on feminism and multiculturalism increasingly summons up for criticism the \nspectre of cultural essentialism. This runs as a thread through the essays in a recent \ncollection on Sexual Justice\/ Cultural Justice (Arneil et al, 2006). It figures in a \u2018mapping \nof the terrain\u2019 as the object of an entire school of post-colonial feminism (Shachar, 2007). \nAnd though I do not much use (or like) the term, I have been willing enough to hear my \nown work on Multiculturalism  without Culture described as a critique of cultural \nessentialism. As its deployment in such works confirms, essentialism is thought to be a \nbad thing. We do not, on the whole, say, \u2018that position is essentialist and that\u2019s why I like \nit\u2019; or, \u2018I have some sympathy with your argument, but find it insufficiently essentialist\u2019. \nAs Ian Hacking (1999:17) puts it, \u2018most people who use (essentialism) use it as a slur \nword, intending to put down the opposition\u2019.  \nYet it is also commonly argued that we cannot avoid at least some kind of \nessentialism: that it is a politically necessary shorthand; or even, in some arguments, a \npsychologically inevitable feature of the way human beings think. Diana Fuss (1989) has \nargued that the essentialism\/ constructionism binary blocks innovative thinking, \nproviding people with too easy a basis for unreflective dismissal. Gayatri Spivak (1988) \nfamously wrote of a strategic essentialism that could invoke a collective category \u2013 like \nthe subaltern or women \u2013 while simultaneously criticising the category as theoretically \nunviable. Though she subsequently distanced herself from what she saw as misuses of the \nnotion of strategic essentialism, the idea that we may have to \u2018take the risk of essence\u2019 in \norder to have any political purchase remains an important theme in feminist theory and \npolitics.  \n 3 \nFrom a different direction, it is sometimes said that while essentialist constructs \nare, in a sense, category mistakes \u2013 drawing the boundaries between peoples or things in \nthe wrong place - there is not much point rubbishing them as analytically wrong, because \nonce in existence, they become part of our social reality. Anthropologist Gerd Baumann \nsimultaneously criticises and accommodates an \u2018ethnic reductionism\u2019 that divided the \npopulation he was studying in Southall, London, into five religio-ethnic groups: Sikhs, \nHindus, Muslims, African Caribbeans, and whites. The categorisation was, he argues, \nseriously misleading, privileging one kind of group identity over others that were more \nimportant, and obscuring the dynamic ways in which group boundaries are drawn and \nredrawn. For many of his older interviewees, it was a particular region of the Indian sub-\ncontinent (the Punjab, Gujarat, Bengal), or particular island of the Caribbean, that \nprovided the key terms of self and other identification; for some of the younger ones, a \nnew \u2018Asian\u2019 identity was being forged that cut across distinctions between Hindu, \nMuslim and Sikh.  The static five-way categorisation - widely employed by local \npoliticians and policy makers, but also by the communities it was describing - reduced or \ndenied this complexity. It mis-represented culture as \u2018an imprisoning cocoon or a \ndetermining force\u2019 (Baumann, 1996:1), encouraged potentially racist stereotypes, and \nsignificantly underplayed the multiple and imaginative ways in which people negotiate \ntheir cultural identities. For all his criticism, however, Baumann does not consider it \nappropriate simply to dismiss \u2018folk reifications\u2019 as falsely essentialised constructs. Once \nthey have entered into people\u2019s self-definitions, they assume a life of their own.i \nSome psychologists, meanwhile, have suggested that essentialist thinking might \njust be part of the human condition, meaning that part of the way human beings process \n 4 \ncomplex information is to seek out a deeper property \u2013 what we might then term an \nessence \u2013linking the things that look alike. If we conceptualise racist thinking, for \nexample, as the presumption that visible differences of skin colour or physiognomy \nindicate something significant about other characteristics like intelligence or \ntemperament, then maybe part of what sustains racist thinking is an innate tendency \nwithin the way we process information. Drawing on studies of pre-school children in \nEurope and the US, Lawrence Hirschfeld (1996) notes that children as young as four \nunderstand racial types in terms of an underlying essence, attributing differences in skin \ncolour to something heritable and fixed at birth, while seeing differences in body shape or \noccupation as more susceptible to change.ii Though stressing that the use of race markers \nas a basis for dividing people up into different kinds may be specific to particular epochs \nand societies, he suggests that the tendency to create \u2018human kinds\u2019, and attribute to at \nleast some of these a \u2018nonobvious commonality that all members of the kind share\u2019 \n(p196) (an essence, in other words) is built into our conceptual system. He is not saying it \nis impossible to eradicate notions of race from our mental repertoires, but he makes the \nplausible point that telling children race is unimportant (as in the advice that \u2018we are all \nthe same inside\u2019) will not be the most effective strategy if it fails to accord with a deeply \nrooted tendency to think in terms of essentially differentiated groups. The particular \nfeatures we employ to identify groups will be shaped by history; but the process of \nidentifying a group by some presumed essence may not be so.  \nEven setting aside the still contested terrain of conceptual systems, it is clear that \ntheoretical analysis depends on at least some process of abstraction. This typically \ninvolves separating out something deemed core from other things deemed peripheral, so \n 5 \nappears almost by definition to involve claims about accident and essence. Sociologists \nfrom the days of Max Weber have been encouraged to hone their analytical tools through \nthe construction of ideal types. Analytic philosophers characteristically develop their \narguments by stripping away misleading \u2018contingencies\u2019 in order to identify essential \npoints. If we take essentialism to mean the process of differentiating something deemed \nessential from other things regarded as contingent, this can appear as a relatively \nuncontroversial description of the very process of thought. \nLike most of those who have used the term, I continue to think essentialism a bad \nthing - but what exactly is wrong with it? Is it a matter of degree, a question of context, or \nsomething that must be avoided at all costs? Part of my previous reluctance to employ the \nterm is that it covers a multitude of possible sins, and in what follows, I identify and \ndiscuss four distinct meanings. The first is the attribution of certain characteristics to \neveryone subsumed within a particular category: the \u2018(all) women are caring and \nempathetic\u2019, \u2018(all) Africans have rhythm\u2019, \u2019(all) Asians are community oriented\u2019 \nsyndrome. The second is the attribution of those characteristics to the category, in ways \nthat naturalise or reify what may be socially created or constructed. The third is the \ninvocation of a collectivity as either the subject or object of political action (\u2018the working \nclass\u2019, \u2018women\u2019, \u2018Third World women\u2019), in a move that seems to presume a homogenised \nand unified group. The fourth is the policing of this collective category, the treatment of \nits supposedly shared characteristics as the defining ones that cannot be questioned or \nmodified without undermining an individual\u2019s claim to belong to that group.  \nThe four are clearly not identical, so one might be engaged in essentialised \nthinking on one score while managing to avoid it on others. Indeed, one of the ironies of \n 6 \nessentialism is that social critics challenging the structures of thought that sustain racism \nand sexism commonly attack the first two, but are often criticised in their turn for falling \ninto the third or fourth. It is, in fact, in our political engagements that we are most likely \nto fall foul of one or other version of essentialism. By the beginning of the twenty-first \ncentury, it is hard to find reputable scholars who can be plausibly castigated for their \ndeployment of essentialised categories: we have most of us been sufficiently sensitised to \nthe dangers to avoid such talk. In our political activities, by contrast, or in policy advice \nthat divides populations into distinct religio-ethnic communities or assesses forms of \nengagement with this or the other \u2018community\u2019, those essentialisms often retain their \nforce. Rogers Brubaker (2002: 166) argues that it is \u2018central to the practice of politicized \nethnicity\u2019 to cast ethnic groups, races, or nations as protagonists, and make claims in their \nname, and his main concern is that academic analysts should not uncritically adopt these \nvernacular categories as their own. In his view, it is a category mistake to criticise the \npolitical practice of essentialising or reifying an ethnic group, for \u2018reifying groups is \nprecisely what ethnopolitical entrepreneurs are in the business of doing\u2019 (167). I do not \nshare his insouciance as regards the political practice. It is in our political activities and \ndiscourses that essentialism is most alive today, and this where it most needs to be \nchallenged.  \n \nEssentialism I \nThe first problem with essentialism is the attribution of particular characteristics to \neveryone identified with a particular category, along the lines of \u2018(all) women are caring \nand empathetic\u2019, \u2018(all) Africans have rhythm\u2019, \u2019(all) Asians are community oriented\u2019. The \n 7 \n\u2018all\u2019 in such claims is usually implicit rather than stated, and even among those who hold \nmost firmly to the view, allowance is commonly made for individual exceptions. It \nwould, however, be a mistake to regard this as absolving the assertion from criticism. As \nthe phrase about it being the exception that proves the rule suggests, acknowledging \nexceptions does not weaken the impact of the general rule. When a category that applies \nto billions (like women) is employed, even the most rigid of essentialists will of course \nanticipate exceptions. Investing such categories with explanatory force still remains an \nextraordinary leap.  \nThat said, there will often enough be some basis for the attribution. It is unlikely \nthat the choice of characteristics is entirely random; and there may well be some observed \nhistory that lends itself to the claim. But the correlation might be statistically \ninsignificant, and even where it is statistically strong, the attribution turns what is only \nprobabilistically true into a much stronger claim. The problem here is one of over-\ngeneralisation, stereotyping, and a resulting inability even to \u2018see\u2019 characteristics that do \nnot fit your preconceptions. In practice, this leads to discrimination:  \u2018I would never \nemploy, marry, believe an X, because they are all unreliable.\u2019  \nThere is plenty of research suggesting that the typical correlations are indeed \nmisleading and overstated. As regards gender differences, it is widely thought that girls \nhave better communication skills than boys and that boys are better at maths, that women \nare more empathic than men and men more aggressive than women, that girls and women \nare better at routine tasks while boys and men are better at complex problem solving; and \nthere is indeed some evidence to substantiate these common beliefs. Yet when Janet \nShibley White (2005) examined 124 meta-analyses of gender difference, she found the \n 8 \ngender differences close to zero or small in 78% of cases. There were differences, but the \nleap from this to claims of the form \u2018(all) women x\u2019 or \u2018(all) men y\u2019 was clearly \nunfounded. The studies approximated the stereotypes in only a few areas:  Hyde reports \nmoderate to large differences in throwing velocity and distance (one thinks of Iris Marion \nYoung\u2019s famous essay (2005) on \u2018Throwing Like a Girl\u2019); in attitudes towards casual sex \n(men liked this more than women); and in physical \u2013 though less so verbal \u2013 aggression. \nIn some of the most interesting results, Hyde reports the enormous power of self-\nstereotyping according to dominant gender codes in \u2018creating\u2019 gender difference. In one \nsuch example, men and women were divided into two mixed groups and asked to \ncomplete the same maths test. The first group was told beforehand that the test was \nthought to contain a certain gender bias, the second that it was gender neutral. The men \ndid better than the women in the first group, but there were no significant gender \ndifferences in performance in the second. Hyde concludes her analysis with a warning \nabout the social costs of overinflated claims of gender differences.  \nSimilar points can be made with regard to inflated claims of cultural difference. \nAs is particularly apparent from recent developments across Europe, exaggerated \ndiscourses of cultural difference can be employed to represent young women from ethnic \nminority backgrounds as peculiarly in need of state protection; and essentialised \nconstructions of oppressive (ethnic minority) families and victimised (ethnic minority) \nyoung women can contribute to a climate in which governments find it acceptable to \nimpose illiberal bans on activities involving minority ethnic groups. The decision of the \nFrench National Assembly to ban schoolchildren from wearing \u2018conspicuous\u2019 displays of \nreligious or political allegiance in public schools (in intention and effect, banning the \n 9 \nMuslim headscarf) is one obvious example, for at least part of the justification for this \nwas the claim that headscarves were being imposed on Muslim schoolgirls by family and \ncommunity pressure.  The policies adopted across Europe of restricting the entry of \nfianc\u00e9es or spouses from outside the European Union until the potential marriage partners \nare variously eighteen, twenty-one, or twenty-four is another telling illustration. Setting \naside, for the purposes of argument, suspicions about the main object being to reduce \nnon-white migration, the rationale is that this protects young people from coercion into \nmarriage, for it is mainly young people of non European origin who are exposed to the \ndangers of forced marriage, and it is plausible to think they will be better able to \nwithstand parental pressure when they are twenty-one or twenty-four than when they are \nsixteen. Different minimum ages for marriage to partners from inside or outside the EU \nare then justified by claims about the greater exposure to familial coercion and lesser \nability to resist it for young people in minority ethnic groups.  These claims reflect and \nreproduce damaging cultural stereotypes (for fuller discussion, see Phillips, 2007; Scott, \n2007; Phillips and Saharso, 2008). \nI do not contest the claim that individuals are coerced \u2013 that some French \nschoolgirls adopt headscarves because of their fears of being harassed or denounced as \nimpure, or that many young people are forced into unwanted marriages \u2013 but I take issue \nwith the kind of racial profiling that generalises from evidence that some young people \nmarrying partners from outside the EU are unwilling participants to a presumption that \nall such marriages are bogus. I do not think it appropriate to impose blanket bans on an \nentire practice because of evidence that some of those engaged in it are being coerced. I \nobject to the failure to recognise that young people from minority ethnic groups can be as \n 10 \nclear in their own minds about the choices they are making as young people anywhere; \nand I believe that an essentialised discourse of minority cultures, as almost defined by \ntheir tendency to coerce and constrain, has combined with an essentialised discourse of \nthe victimised young women from minority groups to legitimate these illiberal policies.   \nAs Ian Hacking reminds us, however, in his sceptical take on social \nconstructionism, something might have an extra-theoretical function \u2013 might, for \nexample, encourage racist or sexist ways of viewing people \u2013 and yet still be true. \nUnmasking a function does not in itself add up to refuting a claim. It has, moreover, been \na key tenet of feminist and critical race theory that there are costs to denying as well as to \nexaggerating difference. Arguing for gender equality on the grounds that there are no \ndifferences between women and men can mean an over-ready acceptance of dominant \nscales of value. Arguing for racial equality on the grounds that we are all the same under \nthe skin can suggest that some skin colours are indeed problematic. Arguing for cultural \nequality on the grounds that people are all fundamentally the same can suggest there is \ntherefore no cost to being expected to align your own cultural practices with those of the \ndominant group. An unreflective critique of essentialism may not sufficiently address \nthese concerns.  \nAcknowledging difference is not necessarily essentialist. Even profiling is not all \nbad. Kasper Lippert-Rasmussen (2006) notes that we do not usually consider it \noutrageous if the police work on the assumption that the perpetrator of a violent crime is \nmore likely to be male than female; and even those strongly opposed to racial profiling \ntend to think it a waste of police resources if they search for the perpetrator of a racist \nhate crime among the victim\u2019s own racial group.iii As regards forced marriage, while I \n 11 \nreject blanket bans, I do not consider it outrageous if police and social workers draw up \nlists of risk factors that help them identify the young people most likely to be at risk of \ncoercion into marriage. Any such list is clearly open to stereotyping and \nmisrepresentation, and it will often be the case that the harms associated with this \u2013 the \npotential demonisation of particular minority groups, and the treatment of young people \nfrom these groups as particularly passive victims \u2013 outweigh any advantages. But if we \nwant societies to take effective action against problems such as forced marriage, targeting \ninformation and resources where they will be most effective looks a sensible idea.  \nThis suggests that what is wrong with this first kind of essentialism is to some \nextent a matter of degree. We can all agree that over-generalisation, stereotyping, and an \ninability even to perceive characteristics that do not fit our preconceptions is a problem; \nbut the very use of \u2018over\u2019 generalisation may then be the important point. It is hard to see \nhow any structured analysis of social and political issues is possible without abstraction \nand the deployment of (then always potentially stereotypical) generalisation. What else, \nafter all, is induction?  Uma Narayan (1998) argues that \u2018antiessentialism about gender \nand about culture does not entail a simple-minded opposition to all generalizations, but \nentails instead a commitment to examine both their empirical accuracy and their political \nutility or risk\u2019. This suggests a continuum rather than an embargo, at least on this first \nversion.  \n \nEssentialism II \nIn the second version of essentialism, characteristics are attributed, not to the individuals \nmaking up a particular category, but to the category itself. So, it is because you are a \n 12 \nwoman that you are more caring than a comparable man, not because you live in a \nsociety where girls and women are expected to be more caring, or a society where family \npolicy encourages a division of labour between male breadwinners and female carers. \nThis is probably what most people understand by essentialism: not merely a perception of \ngroups as different (with the associated risks of over-generalisation), but the attribution of \nthese differences to some underlying and static \u2018essence\u2019. This move naturalises \ndifferences that may be historically variant and socially created. As regards gender or \nrace, this typically involves a biological or genetic determinism. As regards nationality or \nculture, it typically involves a reification that produces the \u2018nation\u2019 or the \u2019culture\u2019 as an \nentity in itself.  As Brubaker (2002:164) puts it, the latter commits the error of \n\u2018groupism\u2019: \u2018the tendency to take discrete, sharply differentiated, internally homogeneous \nand externally bounded groups as basic constituents of social life, chief protagonists of \nsocial conflict, and fundamental units of social analysis\u2019.  \nIt is easy to see why this kind of essentialism is problematic, though again, there \nare risks in overstating the case. We should surely criticise discourses that naturalise \nsocially and historically constructed differences, that attribute, for example, women\u2019s \nlesser participation in the world of high politics to a genetic difference between the sexes. \nIt is not inconceivable, I suppose, that we might uncover a relevant genetic trait, but it \nwould have to be very differentially distributed between the sexes to account for the \ncurrent global imbalance, where women are less than one in five of the world\u2019s elected  \nrepresentatives, and a miniscule proportion of the world\u2019s leaders. There are explanations \nenough for this in the way our societies are organised without drawing on some as yet \nundiscovered string of DNA.  \n 13 \nWe should also, in my view, resist the more modest notion that social differences \nare \u2018grounded\u2019 by nature, because differences involve categories, and categories are the \nkind of thing that human beings produce to achieve some social purpose. I take this to be \nan important part of what Judith Butler (1999) argues in her critique of the sex\/gender \ndistinction. Thinking of \u2018gender\u2019 as a socially variable construct built upon a pre-given \nbiological \u2018sex\u2019 is not enough to save us from the charge of essentialism, for in accepting \nwithout question the naturalness of the founding male\/female divide, we concede too \nmuch to the norms of heterosexuality, and to the practice of grouping people according to \ntheir reproductive organs.  Why not group people according to height? Why not \naccording to the length of their little finger? The reason, obviously enough, is that we live \nin societies that attach enormous significance to reproductive complementarity, and need \ntherefore to know whether someone is biologically \u2018female\u2019 or \u2018male\u2019. But that is already \na social explanation. The choice of salient distinction is not simply given to us by nature. \nIt is itself a social act.  \nThe other point to stress is that the naturalising of socially and historically \ngenerated difference is not restricted to those categories most open to biological or \ngenetic determinism, but can also figure in relation to ones that are self-evidently social \nand historical. Nations, for example, come into existence at particular periods of history, \nand even those with the most ethno-cultural conception of nation or nationality must \nknow that these cannot be defined in biological or genetic terms.  So where is the \nessentialism here? I would locate it in the reification, the construction of nation or culture \nas entity. When people talk of \u2018cultural practices\u2019, or seek to explain the strange \nbehaviour of their neighbours by reference to something termed their culture, they \n 14 \nconjure up a simplified and homogenized thing. As Tariq Modood (2007:93) puts it \u2018rich, \ncomplex histories become simplified and collapsed into a teleological progress or unified \nideological construct called French culture or European civilization or the Muslim way of \nlife\u2019.  It is one thing to talk of there being culturally specific ways of expressing joy or \nmourning the dead or ordering relations between women and men. It is quite another \u2013 \nand far more troubling - to say that \u2018culture x\u2019 organises gender relations in one way and \n\u2018culture y\u2019 in another.  The first way of talking abut cultural difference is always \nvulnerable to stereotypes, over-generalisation, and the rigidity that fails to perceive when \nsimilarities are greater than difference (open, that is, to the worries attached to \nessentialism I), but it can also be relatively uncontentious. The second way of thinking \nabout cultural difference commits us to culture with a capital C, and casts culture itself as \nprotagonist. \u2018Culture\u2019 becomes the explanation, and people\u2019s activities the explanandum. \nThis is a route that brings us to an essentialised version of culture.  \n \nEssentialism III \nThe critique of stereotypes has been a staple of the feminist and anti-racist diet for years, \nand essentialisms I and II have come in for their fair share of attack. The irony, as many \nfeminists and critical race theorists acknowledge, is that movements to combat the \nhierarchical structures that generate and sustain these stereotypes often invoke a \ncollectivity that itself seems to presume a unified, perhaps essentialised, group.  \nFeminism, for example, challenges absurdly over-stated generalisations about women \nand men, attacks discriminations and exclusions on the grounds of gender, and in some \nversions, argues for a world beyond gender. Susan Moller Okin (1989:171), for one, \n 15 \nargues that \u2018a just future would be one without gender. In its social structures and \npractices, one\u2019s sex would have no more relevance than one\u2019s eye color or the length of \none\u2019s toes.\u2019 Yet a feminist movement to achieve this self-evidently anti-essentialist goal \nnecessarily invokes \u2018women\u2019, may indeed make a virtue out of women organising \nautonomously as women, and often calls for gender specific measures that treat women \ndifferently from men. This invocation of the very categories under attack is part of what \nJoan Scott (1996:3-4) calls the \u2018constitutive paradox\u2019 of feminism. As she puts it: \nFeminism was a protest against women\u2019s political exclusion: its goal was to \neliminate \u201csexual difference\u201d in politics, but it had to make its claims on behalf of \n\u201cwomen\u201d (who were discursively produced through \u201csexual difference\u201d). To the \nextent that it acted for \u201cwomen\u201d, feminism produced the \u201csexual difference\u201d it \nsought to eliminate.\u2019  \nIn the very practice of challenging a particular way of conceptualising women, feminists \nthen seem doomed to replicate it.  \nThe \u2018women\u2019 brought into existence through this politics may, moreover, obscure \nmany differences between women along axes such as class, sexuality, race, nationality, or \nreligion. Feminists have rigorously avoided inflated claims about the essential differences \nbetween women and men, but in the practice of feminist politics are likely to make all \nkinds of generalisations about \u2018women\u2019 or \u2018women\u2019s interests\u2019 or \u2018women\u2019s  oppression\u2019. \nThese are not, to be sure, the kind of generalisation that says women are good at routine \ntasks but bad at problem solving, but rather generalisations about women being \ndiscriminated against in employment or under-represented in politics or expected to \nassume primary responsibility for care. Yet these generalisations, too, can obscure \n 16 \nsignificant differences of location and concern, and often mean that the experiences of \n(all) women are read off the specificities of one sub-group. When the sub-group standing \nin for the category as a whole is relatively privileged, this poses an especially acute \nproblem. \u2018The feminist critique of gender essentialism does not merely charge that \nessentialist claims about \u201cwomen\u201d are overgeneralizations, but points out that these \ngeneralizations are hegemonic in that they represent the problems of privileged women \n(most often white, Western, middle-class, heterosexual women) as paradigmatic \n\u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d.\u2019 (Narayan, 1998: 86)  \nUma Narayan goes on to stress the irony: that in addressing the tendency towards \ngender essentialism, feminists sometimes replicated essentialised thinking at a new level. \nThey accepted, that is, the injunction to attend more closely to differences among women \nand not presume that women throughout the world faced the same set of issues and \nconcerns, but they sometimes did this through equally totalising categories such as \nWestern culture, non-Western culture, or Third World women.  It became important not \nto generalise from the experiences of \u2018Western women\u2019 because this was said to fail to \nrecognise the specificities of \u2018Indian\u2019 or \u2018African\u2019 culture\u2019. Essentialised understandings \nof cultural or continental difference then replaced previously essentialised understandings \nof gender. I have said that there are costs to denying as well as to exaggerating difference, \nbut too much anticipation of difference is also dangerous. Generalisations about how the \npeople in particular cultural groups act, or what problems the women in those groups \nface, can be seriously misleading. \nThe worries about simplifying, homogenising, and stereotyping take us back to \nissues already discussed under essentialism I. The more distinctive feature of essentialism \n 17 \nIII is the way movements for political and social change conjure into existence ( in their \nown minds at least) political actors like workers, women, peasants, \u2018the people\u2019; and the \nproblems associated with this way of conceiving social groups. When Spivak made her \nmuch repeated comments about the \u2018strategic use of positivist essentialism\u2019 (1988: 205), \nshe was reflecting on the work of the Subaltern Studies group, and in particular their \nattempt to retrieve an \u2018insurgent\u2019 or \u2018rebel\u2019 or \u2018subaltern\u2019 consciousness from \ndocumentation written from the perspective of counter-insurgents. Claims about group \nconsciousness look like essentialising claims, not just in the modest sense of generalising \nfrom what may be very different individual experiences, but in the attribution of an \nessential personhood to a group. A loose categorisation of multiple locations and \nperspectives then comes to figure almost as a person, capable of acting, willing, \nchallenging, and having a consciousness all of its own. Even if we are suspicious of the \nnotion of individuals having unified identities, the treatment of collectives as quasi-\npersons endows them with more unity than they can justifiably claim. \nCan we, however, think politics without collectivities? Can we think collectivities \nwithout at least some kind of essentialism? In one illuminating discussion of this, Iris \nMarion Young (1994) utilises Sartre\u2019s distinction between group and series to \nconceptualise gender as seriality.  She recommends that we reserve the term \u2018group\u2019 for \nself-consciously mutually acknowledging collectivities with a self-conscious purpose: \nreserve it, that is, for those historically specific and often short-lived moments when \npeople do indeed combine together in a common project, and it becomes appropriate to \ndescribe them as part of a unified group. Groups come and go, however, emerging from \nand falling back into a less self conscious and more passively unified \u2018series\u2019.  A series is \n 18 \ndefined by reference to material practices and structures: \u2018gender , like class, is a vast, \nmultifaceted, layered, complex and overlapping set of structures and objects. Women are \nthe individuals who are positioned as feminine by the activities surrounding those \nstructures and objects.\u2019 (p728)  \nMuch of the time we may not realise we are part of this series, though it could \nbecome quickly apparent when we discover shared limits and constraints. Even in \nrealising this, however, we may choose not to make membership of that particular series \na defining part of our identity. Gender as seriality is a material claim: it commits us to the \nview that there are social structures that impact, in however multifaceted a way, on all \nwomen; and while compatible with a great diversity of ways of experiencing being a \nwoman, and with widespread refusal to adopt gender as self-definition, it would be \nthrown into question by evidence that being a woman set no limits to one\u2019s life. In \nrefusing, however, claims about the unity of experience or unity of identity, it offers a \nnon-essentialist way of thinking of collectives. It also helps us understand the way a \nseries can generate what is, genuinely, a group, and the way a group falls back into the \nrelative passivity of the series, sometimes after succeeding in its political project, \nsometimes after failing.  \n \nEssentialism IV   \nThe final way of thinking about essentialism is in some ways the most challenging, for \nthis is an essentialism that comes into play precisely at the moment when the \ngeneralisation fails and the stereotypes no longer work. This is essentialism at its most \novertly normative: the treatment of certain characteristics as the defining ones for anyone \n 19 \nin the category, as characteristics that cannot questioned or modified without thereby \nundermining one\u2019s claim to belong to the group. So, you\u2019re not really a lesbian if you \nalso sleep with men; you\u2019re not really working class if you like opera; you\u2019re not really a \nMuslim if you tolerate non-believers.  \nThe normative weight is sometimes imposed from the outside, by people so mired \nin their stereotypes that they find themselves compelled to re-categorise those who \ndisplay aberrant behaviour. Unable to cope with the idea that activities, interests, or \nqualities considered intrinsic to one category of person might be found in people \nbelonging to another, they simply re-categorise the person. The more damaging cases are \nthose where the normative weight is imposed from within the collectivity, such that \npeople find themselves repudiated by what they had continued to consider their own \ncommunity. At all those moments when you are told that you are not \u2018really\u2019 (Indian, \nworking class, a feminist, a Trotskyist, whatever), there is a kind of categorical coercion \nat work. You are being refused your own self-definition because of some attribute \ndeemed an essential component of the category you have tried to claim.   \nSadly, this kind of controlling, regulating, and policing activity can characterise \nmovements for social change as much as movements against it. Perhaps particularly at \nthe moment when what Iris Young termed a series generates a self-consciously \ncommitted group, the group may devote much of its energies to policing its own \nboundaries and ensuring that members really are united by the same practices and \nconcerns. It is a frequent comment on radical politics that groups can become more \npreoccupied with the finer points of contention between themselves and their closest \npolitical neighbours than with self-evidently larger areas of disagreement with \n 20 \nmainstream political parties; dissidents within are continually at risk of expulsion. It is \nalso one of the perennial criticisms of identity politics that the identity in question can \nbecome a form of social control, to the point where one\u2019s choice of sexual partner or \nrelationship to one\u2019s parents, or even one\u2019s holiday destination, can become the heated \nobject of political debate. When this happens, the identity is being defined by reference to \nan essential defining characteristic, and those who do not fit are in trouble.  \nOf the various meanings discussed in this essay, this last is the one where the \nessentialism seems most unambiguously wrong. Interestingly, it is also the version that \ncomes least readily to the fore, perhaps because it is so patently grounded in non-\nnaturalistic claims. When people say I cannot regard you as an x because your views or \nlifestyle break the defining codes of x-ness, the \u2018essence\u2019 is clearly a social not a natural \nattribution. If being Indian, for example, were a matter of nature, nothing you \nsubsequently did or said could take it away. It is precisely because it is a social construct \nthat we are able to describe people as no longer \u2018really\u2019 Indian, or no longer  \u2018really\u2019 \nworking class, or no longer \u2018really\u2019 lesbian. This reinforces the point made in relation to \nessentialism II: that it is a mistake to think of essentialism primarily in terms of nature or \nbiology or genetics, for much of what we rightly criticise as essentialist is political or \nsocial or historical. Essentialism is a way of thinking not always so easily distinguished \nfrom more innocent forms of generalisation, and what is wrong with it is often a matter of \ndegree rather than categorical embargo.  It should be clear, however, that we cannot hope \nto draw the line between an acceptable and indefensible essentialism in a distinction \nbetween the natural and the social.  \n 21 \nBibliography \nArneil, Barbara,  Deveaux, Monique, Dhamoon, Rita and Eisenberg, Avigail, eds.
