Introduction  \nThe interfacial phenomena of wetting is often the predominant factor governing whether or not a \ncoating will adhere and bond to a substrate. Although the literature abounds with studies to \ninvestigate the phenomena, most are primarily concerned with the wettability of zirconia and other \noxide ceramics on metals (Chidambaram et al.1992; Li 1992; Li 1995; Nikopoulos & Sotiropoulou \n1987; Ueki et al. 1986), as well as the adhesion of silicone sealants to aluminium (Gutowski et al. \n1992) and the coating of aluminium alloys with ceramic materials (Zhou & DeHosson 1993; Zhou & \nDeHosson 1994). The interfacial mechanisms investigated have focused mainly on the \nthermodynamic criterion (Chidambaram et al.1992; Li 1995; Nikopoulos & Sotiropoulou 1987), the \nelectronic theory (Li 1992) and the occurrence of oxidation (Ueki et al. 1986; Li 1993).  \nThere is a growing amount of published work that testifies to the potential of lasers for altering the \nsurface properties of materials in order to improve their wettability characteristics. The well \ndocumented fact that generated oxide layers often promote metal\/oxide wetting has been reported by \nZhou & DeHosson (1993; 1994) as a result of work on the laser coating of aluminium alloys with \nceramic material. Bahners and Bahners et al. (1993; 1993), have observed and comprehensively \ndetailed the changes in technical properties of various textile fibres, including adhesion and wetting \nproperties, with a view to developing an alternative to the conventional methods of chemical agents \naddition or wet-chemical pre-processing. In recent years the excimer laser has been employed to \nprecisely control and later the surface characteristics of a number of polymer materials. Much \nresearch has been carried out to study the effects of excimer laser radiation on the wettability \ncharacteristics of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in both film (Heitz et al. 1994), fibre (Watanabe \net al. 1993) and sheet (Andrew et al. 1983) form, as well as polyparaphenylene terephthalamide \n(PPTA) (Watanabe et al. 1994). Laurens et al. (1998; 2000) concluded that a more polar surface \nresulted from the excimer laser treatment of polyether-etherketon (PEEK). Comprehensive and \ndetailed investigations by Song & Netravali (1998; 1998\n1\n; 1999) into the effects of excimer laser \nradiation on the interfacial characteristics of UHSPE fibres and epoxy resin revealed a considerable \nincrease in the interfacial shear strength resulted after laser treatment. Furthermore, Heitz et al. \n(1994), Henari & Blau (1995) and Olfert et al. (1996) have found that excimer laser treatment of \nmetals results in improved coating adhesion.  \n 4 \nBut, the reasons for the changes in the wetting characteristics with regard to changes in the material\u2019s \nsurface topography, surface composition and surface energy have not been reported on in great deal \nin any of the previous studies. However, Lawrence and Li have amply demonstrated the practicability \nof employing different types of lasers to effect changes in the wettability characteristics of ceramics \n(1998; 1999; 1999\n1\n) metals (1999\n2\n; 2000) and polymers (2001) for improved adhesion and bonding, \nas well as comprehensively examining the changes in the wettability characteristics of the materials \nin terms of surface topography, surface composition and surface energy. This paper aims not only to \ndescribe a technique whereby a high power diode laser (HPDL) beam was used to alter the \nwettability characteristics of an SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic material, but to elucidate and give a \ngreater understanding of the basic process phenomena and the numerous factors involved. In \nparticular, knowledge of the predominant influential mechanisms, namely topography, microstructure \nand surface chemistry, and the individual effects thereof on the HPDL modified wettability \ncharacteristics of metals is established. This work describes the employment of a number of \ntechniques to isolate these elements, thereby allowing their singular effect on changes to the \nwettability characteristics of the SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic treated with the HPDL to be ascertained. \n2. Theoretical background  \n2.1. Contact angle and wettability \nWhen a drop of liquid is placed on a solid surface it may remain as a spherical drop, or spread to \ncover (wet) the solid surface (Fowkes 1964). The angle with which the liquid subtends the solid is \nknown as the contact angle. In practice, for wetting to occur the contact angle is less than 90\n0\n. If the \ncontact angle is greater than 90\n0\n then the liquid does not wet the solid and no adhesion occurs \n(Fowkes 1964). When a drop of liquid is brought into contact with a flat solid surface, the final shape \ntaken by the drop, and thus whether it will wet the surface or not, depends upon the relative \nmagnitudes of the molecular forces that exist within the liquid (cohesive) and between the liquid and \nthe solid (adhesive) (Fowkes 1964). The index of this effect is the contact angle \u03b8, which the liquid \nsubtends with the solid. \u03b8 is related to the solid and liquid surface energies, \u03b3sv and \u03b3lv, and the solid-\nliquid interfacial energy \u03b3sl, through the principle of virtual work expressed by the rearranged \nYoung\u2019s equation: \n 5 \n   cos\u03b8\n\u03b3 \u03b3\n\u03b3\n=\n\u2212sv sl\nlv\n (1) \nClearly, to achieve wetting \u03b3sv should be large, while \u03b3sl and \u03b3lv should be small. Hence liquids of a \nlower surface tension will always spread over a solid surface of higher surface tension in order to \nreduce the total free-energy of the system (Zisman 1964). This is on account of the fact that the \nmolecular adhesion between solid and liquid is greater than the cohesion between the molecules of \nthe liquid (Fowkes 1964). \nThe adhesion energy of a liquid to a solid surface (the work of adhesion) Wad, is given by the Young-\nDupre equation: \n   ( )Wad lv= +\u03b3 \u03b81 cos  (2) \n2.2. Surface energy and the polar\/dispersive characteristics \nThe intermolecular attraction which is responsible for surface energy, \u03b3, results from a variety of \nintermolecular forces whose contribution to the total surface energy is additive (Fowkes 1964). The \nmajority of these forces are functions of the particular chemical nature of a certain material, and as \nsuch the total surface energy comprises of \u03b3p (polar or non-dispersive interaction) and \u03b3d (dispersive \ncomponent; since van der Waals forces are present in all systems regardless of their chemical nature). \nTherefore, the surface energy of any system can be described by (Fowkes 1964) \n \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3= +d p  (3) \nSimilarly, Wad can be expressed as the sum of the different intermolecular forces that act at the \ninterface (Fowkes 1964): \n ( ) ( )W W Wad add adp svd lvd svp lvp= + = +2 2\n1 2 1 2\n\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3\n\/ \/\n (4) \nBy equating Equation (4) with Equation (2), the contact angle for solid-liquid systems can be related \nto the surface energies of the respective liquid and solid by \n \n( ) ( )\ncos\n\/ \/\n\u03b8\n\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3\n\u03b3\n=\n+\n\u2212\n2 2\n1\n1 2 1 2\nsv\nd\nlv\nd\nsv\np\nlv\np\nlv\n (5) \n 6 \n3. Experimental procedures \n3.1 Materials \nThe SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic material investigated in this work is a novel composition that is used \nin a HPDL-based two stage ceramic tile grout sealing process (Lawrence et al. 1998; \n1\n1998). The \nceramic consisted of mixed vitrifiable oxide powders: SiO2 (53wt%); Al2O3 (42wt%); Fe2O3 (2wt%); \nMgO (1.5wt%); ZrO2 (1wt%) and ZnO (0.5wt%). The oxide powders were sieved to ensure a particle \nsize of less than 75 \u00b5m, then thoroughly mixed together to ensure homogeneity, along with \napproximately 50wt.% diluted sodium silicate solution so as to form a manageable paste. The \ncompound mixture was then pasted on to an ordinary Portland cement (OPC) substrate to a thickness \nof 2 mm and allowed to cure at room temperature for 12 h whereupon it was irradiated with the \nHPDL beam. In order to carry out analytical analyses of the untreated and HPDL treated specimens, \nthey were sectioned with a cutting machine (Struers, Ltd.) using a diamond rimmed cutting blade, and \nthen polished using cloths and diamond suspension pastes down to 1 \u00b5m. The sectioned samples were \nthen examined using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy disperse X-\nray analysis (EDX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. \n3.2 Laser processing procedure \nA HPDL (Diomed Ltd.) emitting at 810 \u00b120 nm and operating in the CW mode with rated optical \npowers ranging from 0-60 W was used in this study. The HPDL beam was delivered to the work area \nby means of an optical fibre 4 m long, and of 600 \u00b5m core diameter, the end of which was connected \nto a 2:1 focusing lens assembly mounted on the z-axis of a 3-axis CNC gantry table. The SiO2\/Al2O3-\nbased ceramic was irradiated using the defocused high order mode HPDL beam with a beam spot \ndiameter of 1.75 mm and laser powers (measured at the workpiece using a Power Wizard power \nmeter) of 20-55 W. A schematic illustration of the laser processing experimental arrangement is \ngiven in Figure 1. Here it can be seen that the defocused HPDL beam was fired across the surface of \nthe SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic by traversing the samples beneath the laser beam using the x- and y-\naxis of the CNC gantry table at speeds ranging from 300 to 480 mm min\n-1\n. So as to investigate the \neffects of process gas type, 3 l min\n-1\n of coaxially blown Ar, N2 and O2 process gas were employed. \n \n \n 7 \n3.3 Wetting and surface energy characterisation procedure \nTo examine the wetting and surface energy characteristics of the SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic and \nhence quantify any surface energy changes in the SiO2\/Al2O3-based resulting from HPDL interaction, \na series of control experiments were carried out using the sessile drop technique with a variety of \nliquids with known surface energy properties. The control test liquids were: human blood; human \nblood plasma; glycerol and 4-octanol. The test liquids, along with their total surface energy ( \u03b3 2 ) as \nwell as the dispersive (\u03b3 lv\nd\n) and polar (\u03b3 lv\np\n) components, are detailed in Table 1. This particular test \nliquid series was selected because it has been shown in previous studies (Agathopoulos & \nNikopoulos 1995; Lawrence & Li 1998; 1999; 1999\n1\n) to be most suitable for ceramic materials such \nas the SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic studied in this work. The experiments were conducted in normal \natmospheric conditions at a temperature of 20\n0\nC \u00b120C with the temperature of the liquids themselves \nthroughout the experiments also being maintained at around 20\n0\nC. The droplets were released onto \nthe surface of the test SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic substrate (treated and untreated) from the tip of a \nmicropipette, with the resultant volume of the drops being approximately 6 x 10\n-3\n cm\n3\n. Each \nexperiment lasted for three minutes with profile photographs of the sessile drops being obtained \nevery minute and the contact angle subsequently being measured. The standard deviation due to \nexperimental error was calculated as being \u00b10.20. \n4. The general effects of high power diode laser radiation on the wettability \ncharacteristics of the SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic material \nThe oxide compounds of the SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic were bound together through mixing with \n50wt% diluted sodium silicate solution. Sodium silicate solution (waterglass) is a viscous colourless \nsolution of colloidal sodium silicate that, when combined with other solutions such as the \nSiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic, forms a gel-like mass of silicate hydrate. Such a mass remains soft and \nmalleable until it is exposed to CO2 gas, either by means of a gas jet or through contact with the \natmosphere (DeGarmo et al. 1997). Exposure of the hardened mass, however, to water results in a \nreversing of the process and the mass returns to a gel-like state. Heating of the hardened SiO2\/Al2O3-\nbased ceramic mass fires the waterglass (similar to that of a ceramic material) (DeGarmo et al. 1997), \nincreasing its strength and enabling it to withstand water exposure. So, exposure of the SiO2\/Al2O3-\nbased ceramic to HPDL radiation results in rapid heating of the surface, for most materials typically \n 8 \n10\n3\n to 10\n5 \nK s\n-1\n (Steen 1991). This will lead to the sintering of the SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic surface \nwith the removal of the pores between the starting particles of the compound, combined with growth \ntogether and strong bonding between adjacent particles (Richerson 1992), thus a much more \nconsolidated surface is created.  \nAn optical micrograph of a sessile drop of a solidified vitreous enamel (20\n0\nC) placed on the surface \nof the SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic before (a) and after (b) HPDL irradiation with \u03b8 superimposed is \nshown in Figure 2. The experimental results showed that throughout the period of cooling of the \nenamel, from the molten state at 600\n0\nC to the solid state at room temperature, no discernible change \nin the magnitude of the of \u03b8 took place during the time of the experiments. This observation indicates \nthat thermodynamic equilibrium was established at the solid-liquid interface at the outset of the \nexperiment (Agathopoulos & Nikopoulos 1995). Figure 2 shows clearly that prior to HPDL \ninteraction, it was not possible to fire the enamel onto the surface of the SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic \nsince \u03b8 was measured as 1180, and as such would prevent the enamel from wetting the SiO2\/Al2O3-\nbased ceramic surface. Indeed, HPDL interaction with the enamel when placed on the untreated \nSiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic surface simply resulted in the \u2018balling\u2019 of the enamel, that is the formation \nof small spheres approximately the diameter of the laser beam itself (Bourell et al. 1992; Agarwala et \nal. 1995). Furthermore, as is evident from Table 2, under the experimental laser parameters employed \nand processing in an O2 atmosphere, HPDL irradiation of the surface of the SiO2\/Al2O3-based \nceramic samples resulted in changes in \u03b8. It can be seen that in general, interaction of the SiO2\/Al2O3-\nbased ceramic with the HPDL beam resulted in the \u03b8 between the SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic and the \ncontrol liquids reducing. \n4.1. The effects of surface topography  \nThe role that surface topography plays in influencing wetting characteristics is of some importance. \nMore specifically, the aspect of surface topography that is of particular importance is substrate \nsurface roughness, for it is this that can contribute to effect changes in \u03b8. Rough grooves on a surface \ncan be categorised as either radial or circular grooves. In practical terms, any rough surface can be \nrepresented by a combination of these two cases (Zhou & DeHosson 1995), with two roughness \nparameters being defined as the Wenzel type, DR (Wenzel 1936) and the Cassie\/Baxter type, FR \n(Cassie & Baxter 1944). In the case that wetting spreads radially, as is the likely case with the \n 9 \nSiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic, then the resulting radial contact angle, \u03b8rad, is related to the theoretical \ncontact angle, \u03b8th, by \n ( )cos cos\u03b8 \u03b8rad R R th RD F F= \u2212 \u22121  (6) \nAccording to Neumann (1974), only if FR is equal to zero, then a model similar to that for \nheterogeneous solid surfaces can be developed in order to account for surface irregularities, being \ngiven by a rearrangement of Wenzel\u2019s equation: \n     \u03b3 \u03b3\n\u03b3 \u03b8\nsl sv\nlv w\nr\n= \u2212\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\ncos\n (7) \nwhere, r is the roughness factor defined as the ratio of the real and apparent surface areas and \u03b8w is \nthe contact angle for the wetting of a rough surface. It is important to note that Wenzel\u2019s treatment is \nonly effective at the position of wetting triple line (Wenzel 1936). Nonetheless, it is evident from \nEquation (7) that if the roughness factor, r, is large, that is the solid surface is smooth, then \u03b3sl will \nbecome small, thus, a reduction in the contact angle will be inherently realised by the liquid if \n\u03b8w<900. Conversely, if \u03b8w>900 then the opposite will be observed. At this point it is worth remarking \nthat other more sophisticated approaches may be taken to examine the effects of surface roughness on \nwetting (Palasantzas & De Hosson 2001). For this present study, however, the use of Equation (7) is \nquite sufficient.  \nReductions in the surface roughness of the SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic were observed (using a Taylor-\nHobson Surtronic 3+ profileometer) after interaction with the HPDL beam when using any of the \nselected process gasses. As one can see from Table 3, the reductions occasioned in surface roughness \nare relatively similar in value. Similar results were obtained by Nicolas et al. (1997), who observed \nthat excimer laser treatment of a ZrO2 ceramic resulted in a smoother surface. Therefore, according to \nEquation (3), a reduction in \u03b8 will be inherently effected. Indeed, Figure 3 shows clearly the effect of \nthe HPDL treated SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic surface roughness on \u03b8. For experimental purposes the \nliquid, selected arbitrarily was glycerol. Such results are in accord with those obtained by Feng et al. \n(1998), who noted that \u03b8 was inversely proportional to surface roughness. \n \n \n 10 \n4.2. The effects of process gas type \nProcess gas type will be significant in determining \u03b8, since the O2 content of a material\u2019s surface is an \ninfluential factor governing the wetting performance of the material (Ueki 1986; Li 1993). \nExperiments were therefore conducted to investigate the effects of using Ar, N2 and O2 process \ngasses on \u03b8. In order to study exclusively the effects of process gas on the wettability characteristics \nof the SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic, the remaining HPDL operating parameters were set such that a \nsimilar degree of melting and solidification occurred and a similar surface roughness was achieved. \nWetting is governed by the first atomic layers of the surface of a material, so to determine the \nelement content of O2 at the surface of the SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic, it was necessary to examine the \nsurface using X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS).  \nThe results of the XPS analysis of the SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic in terms of the surface O2 content \nwhen processed with selected gasses is shown in Figure 4. As is evident from Figure 4, increases in \nthe surface O2 content of the SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic after HPDL interaction were observed only \nwhen processing was carried with an O2 processing gas. In all other instances the surface O2 content \nof both materials was seen to decrease markedly. More significantly, the assertion that surface O2 \ncontent is an important factor in determining \u03b8 is confirmed somewhat by Figure 5, in which the \neffects of the differences in surface O2 content appear to have a noticeable influence on \u03b8. It is \napparent, however, from Figure 5 that the reductions in \u03b8 bear no direct relationship with the surface \nO2 content results given in Figure 4. Indeed, Figure 5 shows that reductions in \u03b8 were brought about \nafter HPDL treatment regardless of the process gas employed, with the reductions being similar in \nvalue. Nevertheless, Figure 5 shows quite clearly that the largest reduction in \u03b8 occurred when O2 \nwas used as the process gas and the surface O2 content was subsequently the highest. \n4.3. The effects of surface energy and its dispersive\/polar attributes \nAccording to Fowkes (1964), the dispersive component of the surface energy of the SiO2\/Al2O3-based \nceramic can be estimated by using Equation (5) and plotting the graph of cos \u03b8 against (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)\n1\/2\n\/\u03b3lv. \nHence the value of \u03b3 sv\nd\n is estimated by the gradient (=2(\u03b3 sv\nd\n)\n1\/2\n) of the line which connects the origin \n(cos \u03b8 = -1) with the intercept point of the straight line (cos \u03b8 against (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)\n1\/2\n\/\u03b3lv) correlating the data \npoint with the abscissa at cos \u03b8 = 1. Figure 6 shows the best-fit plot of cos \u03b8 against (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)\n1\/2\n\/\u03b3lv \naccording to Equation (7) for the untreated and HPDL treated SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic (O2 process \n 11 \ngas) - experimental control liquids system. Comparing the ordinate intercept points of the untreated \nand HPDL treated SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic(O2 process gas) - liquid systems, it can be seen clearly \nfrom Figure 6 that for the untreated SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic (O2 process gas) - liquid systems the \nbest-fit straight line intercepts the ordinate closer to the origin. This observation indicates that, in \nprinciple, dispersion forces act mainly at the SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic (O2 process gas) - liquid \ninterfaces resulting in poor adhesion (Fowkes 1964; Chattoraj & Birdi 1984). Conversely, Figure 6 \nshows that the best-fit straight line for the HPDL treated SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic (O2 process gas) - \nliquid systems intercepts the ordinate considerably higher above the origin. Such a finding implies the \naction of polar forces across the interface, in addition to dispersion forces, therefore improved \nwettability and adhesion is promoted (Fowkes 1964; Chattoraj & Birdi 1984). \nIt is not possible to determine the value of the polar component of the SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic (O2 \nprocess gas) surface energy directly from Figure 6 on account of the intercept of the straight line (cos \n\u03b8 against (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)\n1\/2\n\/\u03b3lv) being at ( )2 1 2\u03b3 \u03b3svp lvp\n\/\n\/\u03b3lv and as such, only referring to individual control liquids \nand not the control liquid system as a whole. All the same, it has been established that the entire \namount of the surface energies owing to dispersion forces of either the solids or the liquids are active \nin the wettability performance (Fowkes 1964; Good & Girifalco 1960). Thus it is possible to \ncalculate the dispersive component of the work of adhesion from Equation (4). The results reveal that \nfor each particular control liquid in contact with both the untreated and HPDL treated SiO2\/Al2O3-\nbased ceramic (O2 process gas) surfaces, Wad  can be correlated with Wad\nd\n by the relationship \n W aW bad ad\nd= +  (8) \nAlso, for the control test liquids used, a linear relationship between the dispersive and polar \ncomponents of the control test liquids surface energies has been deduced which satisfies the equation \n  ( ) ( )\u03b3 \u03b3lvp lvd\n1 2 1 2\n13 115\n\/ \/\n. .= +  (9) \nBy introducing Equation (8) into Equation (6) and rearranging, then \n       ( )W a W badp add= \u2212 +1  (10) \nor \n 12 \n              ( ) ( ) ( )( ) ( )\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3svp lvp svd lvda\nb1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2\n1\n2\n\/ \/ \/ \/\n= \u2212 +  (11) \nFurther, by introducing Equation (9) into Equation (11) and differentiating with respect to ( )\u03b3 lvd\n1 2\/\n, \nconsidering that ( )\u03b3 svd\n1 2\/\n and ( )\u03b3 svp\n1 2\/\nare constant, then the following is valid: \n                         ( ) ( )\n( )\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\nsv\np sv\nd a1 2\n1 2\n1\n0 45\n\/\n\/\n.\n=\n\u2212\n (12) \nFrom a plot of Equation (12), a can be determined for the untreated and HPDL treated SiO2\/Al2O3-\nbased ceramic (O2 process gas) (1.2 and 1.7 respectively). Since \u03b3 sv\nd\n has already been determined for \nthe untreated and HPDL treated SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic from Figure 6, then it is possible to \ncalculate \u03b3 sv\np\n for untreated and HPDL treated SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic (O2 process gas) using \nEquation (12). \nThe values determined for \u03b3 sv\nd\n and \u03b3 sv\np\n for both the untreated and HPDL treated SiO2\/Al2O3-based \nceramic (O2 process gas) are given in Table 4. Evidently the HPDL melting of the surface of the \nSiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic (O2 process gas) leads to a reduction in the total surface energy whilst \nincreasing the polar component of the surface energy, thereby improving the action of wetting and \nadhesion. Such changes in the surface energy of the SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic (O2 process gas) after \nHPDL melting are due to the fact partial vitrification of the surface is occasioned, a transition that is \nknown to effect a reduction in \u03b3sv and an increase in \u03b3 sv\np\n (Agathopoulos & Nikopoulos 1995). It is \nimportant to note that because of the long range ionic interactions in the SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic \n(O2 process gas) and the composite nature of the interfaces between the SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic \n(O2 process gas) and the liquids, it is highly likely that the thermodynamically defined total solid \nsurface energy, as defined in Equation (2), will be higher than the sum of the \u03b3d and \u03b3p components of \nthe surface energy. Indeed, the derivation that leads to Equation (5) can only be done under the \nspecific assumption that the ionisation potentials are all equal and that dipole-dipole random \norientation interactions dominate over dipole-induced dipole random interactions. Although the \nincrease in (excess) surface free energy will probably be less then the increase in the total lattice \nenergy. On the other hand an absorbed liquid layer may shield the ionic fields substantially. As such, \nall the data derived from Equations (4) - (5) and Equations (8) - (12) should be considered as being \n 13 \nsemi-empirical. Notwithstanding this, as the studies by Gutowski et al. (1992) and Agathopoulos & \nNikopoulos (1995) found, it is reasonable to conclude from the data obtained from Equations (8) - \n(12) that HPDL treatment of the SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic surface (O2 process gas) has caused an \nincrease \u03b3p . \n4.4. The effects of surface melting and microstructure \nSuch changes in the surface energy are, along with other things, brought about as a result of changes \nin the microstructure of the SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic after HPDL interaction. From Figure 7(a) it \ncan be seen clearly that before HPDL treatment the surface of the SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic appears \ncoarse, with individual crystals of the constituent components being clearly discernible. After laser \ntreatment (Figure 7(b)) there is more surface ordering, with the surface appearing cellular-dendritic, \nshowing that fusion of the individual particulates has occurred. Such a solidification structure is \nindicative of rapidly solidified microstructures (Kattamis 1981). Moreover, an XRD analysis of the \nSiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic surface before and after HPDL treatment (Figure 8) revealed that, on the \nwhole, the phases present within the HPDL treated region were the same, but their proportions were \ndifferent. In particular, after HPDL treatment it was not possible to detect any SiO2 whilst the Al2O3 \nwas depleted. Yet an EDX analysis showed that Si and Al were still present in similar proportions on \nthe SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic surface before and after HPDL treatment. This indicates that partial \nlaser vitrification of the SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic surface has occurred because these materials are \nglass forming elements, and as such, vitrified when irradiated. Additionally, it is important to note \nthat the peaks in Figure 8 which are unmarked, for ease of analysis since they are not of direct \ninterest, are likely to be mullite (121) and (220), which provides diffraction peaks in the range 35\n0\n to \n40\n0\n. Further, some formation of spinel (MgAl2O4) would perhaps be expected, however, this was not \ndetected.  \nIt is important to determine the degree of HPDL treatment necessary to facilitate such microstructural \nchanges which in turn bring about the surface energy changes. In particular, to establish what part \nmelting of the SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic surface plays in the promotion of wetting. Now, melting of \nthe SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic surface is the direct result of heat input resulting from the energy \ndeposited on the surface by the HPDL beam, which is a function of certain laser operating \nparameters: beam spot size, power and traverse speed. So, in order to analyse the effect melting of the \nSiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic surface has on the wettability performance, a series of wetting experiments \n 14 \nusing a vitreous enamel were conducted to determine \u03b8 for a range of energy densities. The \nexperiments were carried with an O2 process gas. The contact angle measurement procedure was as \ndescribed earlier. The surface condition of the laser treated SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic was \ndetermined by means of SEM analysis. The relationship between \u03b8 and the energy density is shown \nin Figure 9. \nAs is clearly discernible from Figure 9, the surface condition of the HPDL treated SiO2\/Al2O3-based \nceramic has a considerable effect on \u03b8. Notably, Figure 9 indicates that the melting, and consequently \nthe partial vitrification of the glass forming elements (SiO2 and Al2O3) within the SiO2\/Al2O3-based \nceramic, is a prerequisite for realising significant reductions in \u03b8. As one can see, after the onset of \nmelting at around 225 J cm\n-2\n \u03b8 reduces sharply from 1130 to 330, after which no further decrease (or \nincrease) is discernible until the energy density exceeds 525 J cm\n-2\n. After this point a small increase \nin \u03b8 from 330 to 390 was observed. This increase is probably because this energy density level lies \noutside of the optimum operating conditions and will therefore cause an increase in the surface \nroughness which, as was seen earlier, has a small but discernible effect on \u03b8. Furthermore, the mere \nreordering of the crystals, rather than melting and re-solidification, that occurs at power densities \nbelow 225 J cm\n-2\n appears to have only a slight effect on \u03b8, reducing it from 1180 to 1130. Even so, \nsuch a reduction in \u03b8 reveals that HPDL interaction without the incidence of melting does slightly \naffect the wettability characteristics of the SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic. \n5. Determination of the predominant mechanisms governing the high power diode laser \neffected modifications to the wettability characteristics of the SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic \nmaterial \nThe preceding results and discussion demonstrate clearly that interaction of the HPDL beam with the \nSiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic surface resulted in the contact angle formed between the control liquids \naltering to various degrees depending upon the laser processing parameters employed. Such changes \nin the value of \u03b8 are influenced primarily by: modifications to the surface roughness; changes in the \nsurface O2 content and changes to the surface energy characteristics of the SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic. \nFirstly, advantageous modifications to the surface roughness of the SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic were \nseen to take place regardless of the process gas used. This suggests that under the conditions used, \nHPDL treatment of the surface of the SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic generated an ideal amount of surface \n 15 \nmelting and resolidification. This in turn resulted in reductions, to various degrees, in the surface \nroughness, thereby directly reducing \u03b8. Secondly, changes in the surface O2 content of the \nSiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic resulting from HPDL treatment in the various process gas atmospheres is \nan influential factor in the promotion of the action of wetting. This is because an increase in surface \nO2 content inherently effects a decrease in \u03b8 and vice versa. Lastly, an increase in the polar \ncomponent,\u03b3 sv\np\n, of the surface energy resulting from the melting and resolidification of the surface of \nthe SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic occurred. This, event naturally created a different microstructure that \nquite possibly improved the action of wetting and adhesion. \nThis analysis, however, does not make it clear whether after HPDL surface treatment it is the surface \nroughness, the microstructural changes or the O2 content alone, or a combination thereof, that are the \nprincipal mechanisms influencing the observed changes in the wettability characteristics of the \nSiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic. But, by employing a strictly monitored multi-stage grinding procedure, it \nwas possible to isolate the various influential factors detailed above and therefore analyse and \nqualitatively quantify the effect each one had on the wettability characteristics of the SiO2\/Al2O3-\nbased ceramic. In the first stage, the surfaces of the untreated and HPDL treated SiO2\/Al2O3-based \nceramic samples (treated in Ar, N2 and O2 atmospheres) were ground down to a surface roughness \n(Ra) of 3 \u00b5m, whilst still retaining a HPDL treated surface. In this way it was possible to isolate the \neffects of surface roughness by rendering them non-effective, and investigate at least the effects of \nthe microstructural changes (and hence surface energy) and possibly those of the O2 content (and \nhence process gas effects). In order to evaluate the influence of surface roughness an intermediate \ngrinding stage was incorporated in which the samples were ground down to 1 \u00b5m whilst still retaining \nthe HPDL induced microstructure. In the final stage the same SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic samples \nwere ground down further (1 \u00b5m) to remove the HPDL induced microstructures. Thus, one is \neffectively removing the effects of microstructural changes (surface energy) from the previous \ninvestigation, therefore allowing the O2 content (process gas effects) to be studied.  \nAn examination of the contact angle characteristics of the ground SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic samples \nusing only human blood revealed that a large difference in \u03b8 between the HPDL treated and untreated \nsamples was still present. For the HPDL treated samples, \u03b8 had increased slightly across the range of \nsamples to around 39-40\n0\n, whereas \u03b8 for the untreated samples had reduced from 610 to 590. From an \nXPS analysis of the O2 content of the SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic samples, it was found that the O2 \n 16 \ncontent of the untreated sample remained around the original value of 28.1at%, whilst that of the \nHPDL treated samples was found to have reduced to a level similar to that of the untreated sample, \n28.2-28.7at%. Since a considerable difference in the measured contact angles of the HPDL treated \nand untreated SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic samples was still in evidence, despite grinding down the \nsamples to a surface roughness of 3 \u00b5m, then it appears that surface roughness does not have as \ngreater influence on the wetting characteristics of the SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic than that of \nmicrostructure. The slight increase in \u03b8 for the HPDL treated SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic samples is \nbelieved to be due to the reduction on the surface O2 content. This is of importance, for such a \nsupposition implies that surface O2 content is more influential in determining the wetting \ncharacteristics of the SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic than surface roughness. \nThis proposition was borne out somewhat when the samples were ground further. In this subsequent \nstage the samples were ground down to a surface roughness of 1 \u00b5m whilst still retaining the HPDL \ninduced microstructure, thereby allowing a comparative analysis of the effects of surface O2 content \nand surface roughness to be carried out. An XPS analysis of the O2 content of the SiO2\/Al2O3-based \nceramic samples revealed that the O2 content of the untreated and HPDL treated samples remained \naround the values obtained after the first grinding stage; for the untreated sample around the original \nvalue of 28.1at% and likewise for the HPDL treated samples at 28.1-28.7at%. The values of \u03b8 \nobserved for the untreated and HPDL treated SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic were again markedly \ndifferent. As in the previous grinding stage, \u03b8 for the HPDL treated samples remained at 39-400. On \nthe other hand, \u03b8 for the untreated samples had reduced slightly to 580. From this it possible to say \nthat the conceivable reductions in \u03b8 due to reductions in the surface roughness are limited to a value \nwell above that achieved after HPDL treatment. Moreover, since no reduction in \u03b8 for the HPDL \ntreated SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic samples was observed after generating a much smoother surface, \nthen this reveals that surface O2 content is indeed more instrumental in deciding the wetting \ncharacteristics of the SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic than surface roughness.  \nAfter the same SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic samples were ground down further (1 \u00b5m) to remove the \nHPDL induced microstructures, the XPS analysis showed that the surface O2 content on the untreated \nand HPDL treated samples were practically the same at the original untreated value of 28.1-28.4at%. \nSimilarly, an examination of the contact angles for the untreated and HPDL treated samples revealed \nthat \u03b8  for the untreated SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic sample remained at approximately the same value \nas in the previous grinding stage, 58\n0\n. More significantly, \u03b8  for the HPDL treated samples was also \n 17 \nconsistently around the original untreated value of 58-61\n0\n. Basically the removal of the HPDL \ngenerated microstructure appears to have effected an increase in \u03b8 for the HPDL treated samples to \nthe original levels, despite the generation of a much smoother surface (1 \u00b5m compared to 6.3 \u00b5m). \nSuch findings reveal unequivocally that microstructure is by far the most predominant mechanism \ngoverning the wetting characteristics of the SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic. \nSo, it is therefore reasonable to assume that surface energy differences brought about by \nmicrostructural changes have a more active part in deciding the wettability characteristics of the \nSiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic than either surface roughness or surface O2 content. Furthermore, a contact \nangle increase, rather than a decrease, was realised for the HPDL treated SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic \nsamples when reductions in the surface O2 were occasioned and smoother surfaces were generated \nsimultaneously, then it is reasonable to assume that O2 has more influence over the wettability \ncharacteristics of the SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic than surface roughness. \n6. Conclusions \nModification of the contact angle, \u03b8, and hence the wettability characteristics of a SiO2\/Al2O3-based \nceramic material using a high power diode laser (HPDL) has been shown to be a feasible proposition. \nSuch changes in the wettability characteristics of the SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic were attributed \nprimarily to the following factors. Firstly, modifications to the surface roughness resulting from \nHPDL interaction which, regardless of the process gas used, induced an ideal level of melting and \nresolidification. This in turn effected reductions to various degrees in the surface roughness from an \nRa value before HPDL interaction of 25.9 \u00b5m to 6.3-6.6 \u00b5m after HPDL treatment, thereby directly \nreducing \u03b8. Secondly, the 40at% increase in the surface O2 content of the SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic \nafter HPDL treatment in the various process gas atmospheres; since an increase in surface O2 content \nintrinsically brings about a decrease in \u03b8, and vice versa. Finally, the semi-empirically determined \nincrease in the polar component of the surface energy, \u03b3 sv\np\n, of the SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic (O2 \nprocess gas) from an original value of 2.0 mJ\/m\n2\n to 16.2 mJ\/m\n2\n. This increase was the result of the \nHPDL induced surface melting and resolidification which consequently created a partially vitrified \nmicrostructure that was seen to augment the action of wetting and adhesion.  \nWork was conducted to isolate each of these mechanisms, thereby allowing the magnitude of their \ninfluence to be qualitatively determined. The degree of influence exerted by each factor was found to \n 18 \ndiffer considerably. From the analysis, surface energy, by way of microstructural changes, was found \nto be by far the most predominant mechanism governing the wetting characteristics of the \nSiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic. To a much lesser extent, surface O2 content, by way of process gas, was \nalso seen to influence to a changes in the wettability characteristics of the SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic, \nwhilst surface roughness was found to play a minor role in inducing changes in the wettability \ncharacteristics. Furthermore, based on the findings of this study, it is not unreasonable to assert that \nthe results are generic and could therefore be applied to many ceramic materials of a similar nature in \nterms of wettability characteristics modification by means of HPDL radiation. \nAcknowledgements \nThe author would like to express his gratitude to Prof. Lin Li of the Laser Processing Research \nCentre in UMIST for allowing him to use the high power diode laser.
