It is added during comminution, gravity concentration  \nor more commonly after gravity concentration, when the gold is concentrated along  \nwith heavy black sands. During amalgamation, mercury is added to the gold concentrate \nand agitated vigorously to force it and gold particles to make contact, which results in a \npasty amalgam. This is subsequently separated from the black sands and after \u2018squeezing\u2019 \nout excess mercury, the amalgam is often heated in the open air to obtain \u2018sponged\u2019 gold. \nMercury is lost in the process either as globules due to spillage and careless disposal of \namalgamation residues, as well as in gaseous form, released during the heating of the \namalgam. \nIn Ghana small-scale gold mining has contributed immensely to the national \neconomy: between 1989, when it was officially legalised in the country, through to 2008, \nit accounted for the production over three million ounces of gold. This production \naccounted for over US$500 million; the sector currently accounts for 16% of national \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n    The application of direct smelting of gold concentrates 3    \n \n    \n \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n       \n \ngold output (Anon, 2009; Cleland, 2008). The rise in production in the sector has  \nalso resulted in increased use of mercury. It is estimated that for every gram of gold \nrecovered by ASM, there is an equivalent amount of mercury lost to the environment. \nThus, for the period under consideration, about three million ounces (93 tonnes) of \nmercury has been discharged into the environment due to ASM activities. \nMercury is a toxic metal and when methylated, it becomes extremely toxic.  \nIts impacts on the environment and human health in communities where small-scale  \ngold mining flourishes have been documented. Work undertaken in sub-Saharan Africa, \nAsia and Latin America shows that in small-scale mining communities, both miners and \nnon-miners are exposed to mercury to varying degrees of exposure and contamination \n(Appleton et al., 1999; Anon, 1999; Drasch et al., 2001; Babut et al., 2003; Serfor-Armah \net al., 2004; Tschakert and Singha, 2007; Hilson et al., 2007). Ghana has been \nparticularly affected, as illustrated by a recent study conducted in Dumasi, an ASM \ncommunity (Babut et al., 2001, 2003). The analysis determined that 20% of sampled \npersons had tremors and 65% had sleep disorders. Examination of mercury in biological \nsamples indicated that between 86% and 91% of people tested had varying levels of \nmercury intoxication and that the metal is having an impact on the public health of the \nASM community. \nIn response to levels of mercury intoxication recorded in studies in small-scale \nmining centres around the world, several interventions have been made with the aim of \nreducing its usage and losses to the environment. Some of the methods that have  \nbeen prescribed include winnowing, the coal gold agglomeration process, smelting,  \nand leaching processes such as IGoli, Haber and cyanidation. Coal-gold agglomeration  \nis a physical-chemical process that utilises pulverised coal for the agglomeration of  \nfine gold particles, followed by flotation with diesel, kerosene and other oils (Hilson and \nMonhemius, 2006). The float concentrate has to be processed and smelted. On the other \nhand, IGoli, Haber and cyanidation processes utilise leaching reagents to dissolve gold \nand solutions have to be processed further for gold recovery. The small-scale mining law \nin Ghana does not permit the leaching of gold due to the harmful nature of the chemicals \ninvolved and the low safety consciousness of the miners. Thus, for now, none of  \nthese chemical processes can be applied. Direct smelting, on the other hand, could \ngenerate a final product in one step, and is something with which miners are  \nalready familiar because they smelt sponge gold after amalgamation and retorting\/heating \n(Anon, 2003; Styles et al., 2009). \nThe Ghana Mercury Pollution Abatement Project was implemented by the European \nUnion in 2006. Its purpose was to review the mining and processing methods utilised by \nsmall-scale miners in Ghana, and to develop an alternative method for extracting gold \nfrom concentrates without the use of mercury. Findings from research undertaken during \nthe first phase of the project, reported by Styles et al. (2009) in this issue, revealed that \nminers would accept any method that was inexpensive, fast, easy to use, transparent and \nsuitable for small batches. \nThe first phase of the study also identified direct smelting of gold concentrates as a \nmethod that could potentially replace mercury amalgamation and retorting. In the second \nphase, described in this paper, direct smelting was tested at both the bench scale in the \nlaboratory and in the field. The target was to test direct smelting and \n \n \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   4 R.K.

Of the five samples, two were sulphidic, two were free milling and one was  \nof alluvial origin. One of both of the sulphidic and free milling samples was taken from \nthe Tarkwa area in Southern Ghana and the others from Bolgatanga in the Upper East \nRegion. The alluvial ore was obtained from Bonte, in the South-Central part of Ghana. \nThe locations of the areas where samples were taken are shown in Figure 1. \nFigure 1 Geological map of Ghana showing the location of gold-bearing areas  \nand the places where samples were collected (see online version for colours) \n \nSource: Adapted from Anon (2008) \n \n \n \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n    The application of direct smelting of gold concentrates 5    \n \n    \n \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n       \n \n2.2 Sample preparation and laboratory analysis \nThe hard rock samples were passed through primary crushing in a hammer mill, followed \nby dry grinding in a disc mill and screen analysis showed that 80% of the product was \nfiner than 250 \u00b5m. The milled samples were sluiced and the rougher concentrate \ncollected. After several batches of the material had been sluiced, the rougher concentrate \nwas cleaned in a pan in order to estimate the free gold content. The alluvial sample did \nnot go through comminution but was sluiced after scrubbing and screening. \nFive, 8 kg gold-containing black sand samples, obtained following gravity \nconcentration, were used to investigate and establish the efficiency of direct smelting of \nblack sands compared with amalgamation followed by retorting and smelting.  \nSamples were split into four and each was cleaned on a shaking table. The cleaned \nconcentrate was re-cleaned on a pan to obtain a maximum final weight of 50 g.  \nA flowsheet of the work scheme is presented in Figure 2. \nFigure 2 Flowsheet showing the steps involved in the analyses \n \nAmalgamation was carried out by introducing mercury into bottles containing black \nsands. The bottles were subsequently agitated for 20 min before separation of the \namalgam. Retorting was carried out in a ThermEx glass retort1 and heating was carried \nout for about 90 min. The sponge gold obtained was smelted with borax, a low melting \npoint flux, while residual gold in the barren black sands was determined by conventional \nfire assaying. Two sub-samples of the final concentrates were dried, fluxed and smelted. \nGold was finely divided in these samples and smelting was conducted at 1100\u00b0C in a \nlaboratory furnace. The flux consisted of sodium tetraborate (borax), sodium carbonate \n(soda ash) and potassium nitrate (nitre) but the actual flux composition utilised for each \nsample depended on its sulphur and iron content. \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   6 R.K. Amankwah et al.     \n \n    \n \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n       \n \nOne sub-sample was amalgamated while the fourth was kept as a reference  \nsample which could be used if problems were encountered during processing of the \nothers. The tailings obtained from each of the three samples processed by either \namalgamation or direct smelting were analysed for gold by conventional fire assaying. \n2.3 Field trials \nField investigations were conducted for both direct smelting, and amalgamation and \nheating methods. No special equipment was required for amalgamation and retorting,  \nas the standard technique used by the miners was tested. A smelting furnace, called sika \nbukyia, was constructed and tested for smelting of gold concentrates produced  \nfrom small-scale mining operations. The furnace (Figure 3) has a steel shell and a heating \nchamber lined with refractory bricks. The external dimensions of the furnace are \n50 cm \u00d7 35 cm and the combustion chamber has dimensions 37 cm \u00d7 23 cm. Because of \nthe size of the combustion chamber, it can accommodate two smelting crucibles.  \nA removable chimney equipped with an electric fan extracts flue gases from the heating \nchamber and away from the operator. With the chimney on, the furnace stands at 206 cm. \nThe initial fuels used were wood charcoal and palm kernel shell. \nFigure 3 A picture of the sika bukyia (see online version for colours) \n \n3 Results and discussion \n3.1 Direct smelting vs. amalgamation and retorting \nIn this study, gold recovery by direct smelting of concentrates and that via amalgamation, \nretorting and smelting were compared in terms of recovery and time utilised for the \noperation. Laboratory investigations conducted on alluvial, free milling and sulphidic \nores indicated recovery of about 99% for direct smelting.

This is definitely more effective than rubbing the sands with bare fingers as is \nthe practice among small-scale miners. This yielded a minimum recovery of 95%  \n(Tables 1 and 2), which is certainly higher than the standard ASM practice. \nTable 1 Results of samples treated by amalgamation followed by retorting and smelting \nSample \nWeight of \nsponge \ngold (g) \nWeight of \nsmelted \ngold (g) \nSpecific \ngravity \nActual \ngold (g) \nGold in \ntailings (g) \nRecovery \n(%) \nAlluvial 1.06 0.97 19.25 0.9675 0.0020 99.8 \nFree milling ore 1 5.72 5.20 18.95 5.1057 0.0609 98.8 \nFree milling ore 2 0.12 0.10 19.20 0.0995 0.0029 97.2 \nSulphidic ore 1 1.11 1.08 19.20 1.0744 0.0122 98.9 \nSulphidic ore 2 1.41 1.30 18.57 1.2508 0.0604 95.4 \nTable 2 Results of samples treated by direct smelting \nSample \nWeight of \nsmelted gold (g) \nSpecific \ngravity \nActual \ngold (g) \nGold in \ntailings (g) \nRecovery \n(%) \nAlluvial 0.93 19.25 0.9276 0.0002 99.98 \nFree milling ore 1 4.32 19.20 4.2976 0.0016 99.96 \nFree milling ore 2 2.08 19.26 2.0757 0.0008 99.96 \nSulphidic ore 1 2.49 19.25 2.4835 0.0006 99.98 \nSulphidic ore 2 3.86 19.20 3.8400 0.0008 99.97 \nField tests were conducted on ten samples for both direct smelting and amalgamation, \nyielding a recovery of 98% for the former and 88% for the latter. It was observed  \nthat gold particles coated with iron oxides were not incorporated into the amalgam,  \nand fine gold particles were lost when excess mercury is squeezed through the fabric. \nDirect smelting is not well-suited for samples with very low gold content. For efficient \nsmelting and easy separation of gold bead from the slag, the weight of gold in the \nconcentrate should be about 0.5 g. Figure 4 illustrates how gold separates from the slag \nafter smelting. \nFigure 4 Separation of gold from slag (see online version for colours) \n \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   8 R.K. Amankwah et al.     \n \n    \n \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n       \n \nThe flowsheet in Figure 2 shows that processing of gold concentrates using \namalgamation, retorting and smelting involves four steps while that by direct smelting \ninvolves two. The possible time savings from direct smelting could be appealing to the \nminers. Field trials by the authors indicate that amalgamation may be conducted for \nbetween 15 min and 45 min, depending on the amount of gold concentrate. About 5 min \nis spent on heating the amalgam, and another 10\u201315 min on smelting the sponge gold, \nwhich makes the process quite time-consuming and bringing the total time spent up to \n65 min. Since the smelt house will be some distance away from the gravity separation \nunit, some more time is utilised in transporting the sponge gold. Sample preparation  \nand preheating for direct smelting took 10 min, while smelting took up to 35 min,  \na combined total of 45 min. Thus, there are savings in time with direct smelting and it can \nall be carried out in one location. \n3.2 Fuels used in direct smelting \nThe use of charcoal, although regarded as both cheap and easily accessible by small-scale \nminers, has an environmental impact. It is, therefore, desirable to identify and test \nalternative fuels that could replace charcoal but maintain its strong points (cheap, easily \naccessible, high calorific value and environmentally friendly). Palm kernel shells were \nidentified as one of these alternative fuels. The shells are available around the country, \nexcept in the north, and are discarded as waste by local palm oil processors, by itself a \nsituation that is of concern to environmentalists. As such, the use of this as an alternative \nfuel would have a positive environmental impact and at the same time, provide miners \nwith an efficient fuel that is cheaper and which has a high calorific value necessary for \nsmelting.  \nIn a manner similar to smelting with charcoal, complete smelting was achieved within \n45 min, after which, the crucible was removed and the molten material was poured  \ninto a mould and allowed to cool. The purity of gold obtained this way was comparable \nto that obtained when charcoal was utilised. Due to the smaller sizes of the shells,  \nit was necessary to reduce the airflow rate into the combustion chamber to prevent the \nparticles from being blown out of the furnace. The temperature profile of both charcoal \nand kernel shells are shown in Figure 5. \nFigure 5 Temperature profiles for both charcoal and palm kernel shells \n \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n    The application of direct smelting of gold concentrates 9    \n \n    \n \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n       \n \nThe temperature profile indicates that charcoal generates a much higher and steady \ntemperature than the kernel shells. In addition, charcoal creates a more stable bed for the \ncrucibles throughout the smelting period. Though melting of the charge was achieved \nwith both fuels, the relatively low measured temperature may be due to a lower  \nfuel density and higher heat loss associated with the use of kernel shells. As shown  \nin Figure 6, the flames generated during initial combustion were very intense and \nsufficiently high enough to pass through the chimney, and is often accompanied by  \nthick smoke. It is likely that this is due to the higher volatile content of the kernel shells. \nThese initial tests show that kernel shells are useable but are not as effective as charcoal. \nIt is possible that performance could be enhanced by simple crushing and pelletising.  \nIn both cases, a maximum of 12 kg of fuel was required for a complete smelting \noperation. Other fuels such as Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), shea butter waste and saw \ndust have been identified but yet to be tested. \nFigure 6 Intense flames generated by the combustion of kernel shells (see online version  \nfor colours) \n \n3.3 Smelting of sulphide concentrates \nIt is necessary for sulphide minerals in the concentrate to be oxidised either before or \nduring smelting. Nitre is used in the smelting of sulphidic concentrates and acts as an \noxidising agent. It was observed that the addition of this chemical causes excessive \nboiling of the molten material with the possibility of spillage. Optimisation tests indicated \nthat the maximum amount of nitre necessary to prevent excessive boiling and spillage \nwas not enough to oxidise sulphides, therefore resulting in low purity of the gold bullion. \nAn alternative method, pre-smelting oxidation, was adopted. This involved roasting  \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   10 R.K. Amankwah et al.     \n \n    \n \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n       \n \nof the concentrate on the hot charcoal in the combustion chamber of the furnace.  \nFor the standard weight of sample, 50 g, up to 10 min roasting was found to be suitable. \nIt was observed that after roasting, gold included in the sulphide particles was \nreleased and reported as part of the bullion. Indeed, when weighed amounts of gold were \nused in seeding such concentrates, there was an appreciable increase in bullion weight.  \n3.4 Economic considerations \nA cost comparison was undertaken for processing 62 g of gold contained in a \nconcentrate. Field trials indicated that this weight is apparently the maximum amount of \ngold that can be amalgamated with half a teaspoon of mercury (27 g). A teaspoon is one \nof the units in which mercury is sold to small-scale miners. Since the mercury is heated in \nan open fire, it is lost and the cost can be debited directly to the operation. A similar \namount of gold was used in a smelting operation. As shown in Table 3, it costs US$ 5.50 \nfor amalgamation and heating, while direct smelting cost US$ 3.20. This makes direct \nsmelting a more economically-viable alternative. \nTable 3 Cost comparison between direct smelting and amalgamation followed by heating \nAmalgamation Cost ($) Direct smelting Cost ($) \nHalf teaspoonful of mercury (27 g) 4.00 Crucibles (2) 3.20 \nFuel (charcoal) for heating of amalgam 0.50 (including charcoal for \nsmelting and flux) \n \nFuel (charcoal) for smelting 1.50   \nTotal 5.50  3.20 \n4 Challenges and ways forward \nA main problem encountered during the field trials was that scavenged concentrates  \noften contained several free metallic components that interfered with smelting, resulting \nin the production of bullion with very low purity. Moreover, the hammer and disc mills \nused grinding surfaces that quickly wear and break; as such flakes of steel and other \nmetals become mixed in the concentrate. The metal pieces and filings may be removed \nwith a low intensity magnet but to ensure that most of the metal is removed, this needs  \nto be done carefully and can therefore be quite slow. These concentrates may also be \nwashed with nitric acid to get rid of remaining base metals before smelting. Safety and \nenvironmental concerns demand that the operation be conducted in a well ventilated  \narea or fume chamber, and the waste acid neutralised with a base or diluted with large \namounts of water before disposal. One major challenge was the failure of crucibles \nduring smelting. Some locally-manufactured crucibles are not competent enough  \nand there was migration of molten material through the crucible walls and in some  \ncases crack formation during smelting. Collaborative research with local crucible \nmanufacturers is ongoing. \nMercury is used to recover gold from concentrates in small-scale gold mining \noperations but its negative environmental and health impacts has prompted research  \ninto safer alternatives. In this study, direct smelting has been tested as an alternative  \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n    The application of direct smelting of gold concentrates 11    \n \n    \n \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n       \n \nto gold extraction by amalgamation and retorting in small-scale gold recovery.  \nDirect smelting has the advantage of recovering gold particles that are occluded in ore \nparticles that report in the concentrate and coated gold particles both of which cannot  \nbe picked by mercury. Sulphides in the concentrate will decompose and release  \nthe contained gold, and very fine particles that escape during the squeezing of excess \nmercury from the amalgam will be also be retrieved. \nIt was realised from the study that direct smelting is a viable option both in the \nlaboratory and in field trials. By using the right combination of borax, soda ash and silica, \ngold bearing black sands were smelted with relatively high recoveries. Field tests  \nfor recovery via amalgamation, heating and smelting gave an average recovery of  \nabout 88% while figures for direct smelting are above 99%. In addition, it takes a shorter \ntime to execute. The furnace (sika bukyia) constructed for direct smelting application \nworks on charcoal and very high temperatures of over 1300oC were attainable during \ncombustion. Charcoal burns to give a relatively uniform temperature range and when \npacked, it provides a stable bed for the crucibles. Palm kernel shells may serve as a \nsubstitute for charcoal as it is cheap, has a high calorific value. The response of miners \nwho witnessed the demonstrations was very positive, and they are eager to give this \nmethod a try. Some volunteered and gave their gold bearing black sands for smelting. \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors are grateful to the European Union for sponsoring the project.
