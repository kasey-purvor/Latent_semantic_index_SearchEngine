Introduction: Nanostructured materials and systems have generated \nintense scientific and technological interest over the last few years because of \ntheir unique properties and potential applications in areas as diverse as \nelectronics, optics, information storage, bio-medicine, sensors and product \nlabelling. A variety of interesting approaches have been developed for the \ngrowth of nanostructures one of them is ferroelectric nanolithography [1], \n* 2. REVISED MANUSCRIPT: CHANGES NOT IN BOLD\nPage 2 of 22\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n2\nwhich facilitates the growth of 3D nanostructures on predefined locations on a \nferroelectric surface. \nFerroelectric materials are now considered and treated as wide band gap \nsemiconductors rather than insulators [2]. In ferroelectric materials such as \nlead zirconate titanate (PbZrxTi1-x)O3 a polarization bound charge exists in the \nvicinity of surfaces and interfaces which is compensated by internal and\/or \nexternal screening. External screening involves surface adsorption of \noppositely charged molecules or ions from the atmosphere on the surface of \nthe ferroelectric. Molecules with a dipole can also orient themselves on the \nsurface to screen charge. Internal screening involves compensation of surface \npolarisation charge by defects and free charge carriers in the bulk of the \nmaterial and takes the form of space charge region (SCR) due to \u2018band \nbending\u2019 at the surface [3]. \nWhen a photosensitive material such as a ferroelectric is exposed to high \nenergy UV light, photoexcited charge carriers (e--h+) pairs are generated in \nboth the surface layer and the bulk of the film as deep as the absorption limit. \nThese charge carriers are driven apart by the internal electric field in the SCR. \nIn the positively polarised domains electrons are forced to migrate towards the \nsurface [4] and in negatively polarised domains electrons move away from the \nsurface and towards the bulk. When the ferroelectric surface is dipped in a \nsilver salt (AgNO3) solution and exposed to UV light, the metal cations can \nreact with photoexcited electrons available on c+ domains and are reduced to \nsilver metal. It is also possible to produce PbO by oxidation of lead salts on \nthe negatively poled domains. The photoreduction and photoxidation \nPage 3 of 22\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n3\nreactions on c+ and c- domains are described by reactions 1 and 2 \nrespectively.\n                                                   Ag+ +  e- \u2192 Ag0                                         (1)\n                                        Pb2+ + 2H2O + 2h\n+ \u2192 PbO2 + 4H+                      (2)\nOn a positive (c+) domain the Ag+ ions should not be intimately attached to \nthe c+ surface and in fact the negatively charged counter ions would be \nforming a Stern or double layer [5]. Therefore there was a tunnelling \nmechanism that was allowing the electrons to pass through the bound ions \nand reduce the metal cations to metal. Recent works by Giocondi and Rohrer\n[6] shows that similar domain specific reactivity exists on the surfaces of \nferroelectric microcrystal owing to the existence of dipolar field effect. Similar \nspatially selective oxidation and reduction reactions were observed on non \nferroelectric SrTiO3 surfaces [7].\nThe growth of metallic nanostructures on ferroelectric materials has been \nshown to be dependent on a number of surface phenomena such as grain \nboundaries [8], ferroelectric domains [1] and domain boundaries [9]. The \nphotochemical reactivity of ferroelectric surfaces is not only dependent on \npolarization of domain that is underlying the surface [10] but also the \ncrystallographic orientation of the sample [11] and the density of defects in the \nsample [9] [12]. \nMany studies on the structural, electrical [13] [14]and optical properties [15] of \nPZT films of different stoichiometric compositions have been reported but very \nlimited information exists on  the photochemical properties of different \ncomposition of PZT. The compositions used here are PbZr0.3Ti0.7O3 and \nPbZr0.52Ti0.48O3; the crystallographic structure at room temperature according \nPage 4 of 22\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n4\nto bulk phase diagram is tetragonal (space group P4mm) and coexistence of \ntetragonal and rhombohedral (morphotropic phase boundary) respectively. \nInvestigations show that PZT 52\/48 possess a higher piezoelectric coefficient \nthan PZT 30\/70 because of the increased ease of reorientation during poling. \nCoupling factor and dielectric constant are also found to be highest near the \nmorphotropic phase boundary. We have investigated the photochemical \nproperties of PZT thin films of different stoichiometric compositions by \ncarrying out the Ag nanocluster deposition experiments using two UV lamps \nof different intensities. We have focussed on the nature and reasons behind \nthe preferential growth of nanoparticles on patterned PZT. Therefore by \ntracking the change in the Ag nanoparticle deposition we are generating a \nhandle for understanding the impact of Zr\/Ti ratio in the PZT on the \nphotochemical reactivity at the surface. The difference in deposition pattern is \nattributed to the difference in the magnitude of spontaneous polarization, \neffective hole concentration and the band gap of the two samples which \nimpacts the shape and width of space charge region (SCR) in the two \nsamples resulting in a change in the band bending at the surface.\n2. Experimental \nPZT films, with the Zr\/Ti ratio of 30\/70 and 52\/48 were made using a sol-gel \nprocess.  The sols were prepared according to previously published work [16]. \nThe substrate was prepared by sputtering Pt (100 nm)\/Ti (5 nm) onto Si \nwafer. The sol was then spin coated onto the substrate. The sample was \nprocessed according to previously published work [16] [17] and gave a  PZT \nfilm that was 70 nm thick. In each case the sample was 2 cm2 in area. Film \nPage 5 of 22\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n5\norientation was determined using X-ray diffraction measurement on a \nSiemens D5005 diffractometer using CuK\u03b1 radiation. \nThe samples were poled using a modified DI 3000 Atomic Force Microscope \n(AFM) system in PFM [18] mode using a conductive cantilever (a Veeco \ncontact mode cantilever made of Antimony doped Si, resonant frequency 130-\n250 kHz). The base electrode of the sample was obtained by scratching a part \nof the sample and connecting using silverdag.  For poling the cantilever and \nthe sample base electrode were connected to a DC power supply set at 12V. \nThe pattern produced was a series of squares of reduced dimensions set \ninside each other of opposite domain orientation\nA fresh solution of 0.01M AgNO3 was prepared. A drop of this solution, which \nwas filtered using a 0.2 \u03bcm filter, was put over the poled pattern. The sample \nwas irradiated with a UV lamp for 20 minutes. Two UV lamps a Honle 400 W \nHg lamp (H lamp) and a Honle 400 W Fe-doped Hg lamp (F lamp) both giving \nirradiation from 200-400 nm (6.2-3.1 eV) have been used in our experiments \n[19]. The spectrum of \u2018H\u2019 and \u2018F\u2019 lamps are shown in figure 1. The emission \nspectrum for \u2018H\u2019 lamp indicates that it is a higher energy lamp compared to \u2018F\u2019 \nlamp because of its higher flux of photons above the band gap energy. After \nirradiation the samples were rinsed in deionised water and blow dry with N2.\nThe samples were imaged using a Philips XL30 SFEG scanning electron \nmicroscope. In each case the presence and absence of silver was confirmed \nusing the EDX technique. The EDX software was first calibrated using a \nstandard Co sample and then the percentage deposition of Ag was calculated \nin small areas on all the samples. The experiments were repeated on five \nPage 6 of 22\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n6\ndifferent PZT samples of each composition and same results were obtained \non all samples of a composition.\n3. Results and Discussion\nXRD patterns of PZT (30\/70) and PZT (52\/48) are shown in figure 2. The \npreferred orientation in both the films is calculated using the intensities of the \n(111), (100) and (110) peak and the following equation:\n)( xyzI =\n)110()100()111(\n)(\nIII\nI xyz\n\uf02b\uf02b (3)\nUpon comparison of relative intensities it was found that PZT (30\/70) is highly \n(111) oriented whereas in PZT (52\/48) about 30% of crystals are (100) \norientated and 70% are (111) orientated. The growth of PZT films is \nnucleation controlled and the orientation of PZT films is based on the \nsubstrate used. The reason for the less well (111) orientation of PZT 52\/48 is \ndue to the increase in lattice mismatch between the (111) - oriented Pt and \n(111)-oriented PZT with the increase in Zr content. The XRD pattern also \nshows absence of any intermediate pyrochlore phase in both samples. Figure \n3 show that both the PZT samples have discrete grains with a random \norientation across the surface before poling. The grain size in PZT 52\/48 is \nlarger than the grain size in PZT 30\/70 this is because the grain sizes of PZT \nfilms strongly depend on the composition ratio via different nucleation\/growth \nenergy. The films with higher Ti content have smaller nucleation energy and \ntherefore smaller size of the grains [20].  A typical PFM image of the poled \npattern is shown in figure 4.\nPage 7 of 22\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n7\nThe patterned PZT surface immersed in silver nitrate solution was placed \ninside a UV box fitted with the \u2018F\u2019 or the \u2018H\u2019 lamp (as defined earlier) and \nirradiated for 20 min. The SEM images of photodeposited silver are shown in \nfigure 5. Upon irradiation with \u2018F\u2019 lamp PZT 52\/48 showed deposition of silver \nonly on c+ domains and no deposition on c- domains. Whereas when high \nenergy photons from \u2018H\u2019 lamp were used to irradiate the surface silver \nnanoparticles were deposited on both c+ domains and the c- domains. The \nsize of silver particles on c- domains is smaller and deposition is less dense \ncompared to the c+ domain. On a PZT 30\/70 sample upon irradiation with \u2018F\u2019 \nlamp a similar deposition pattern is observed with silver present in c+ and \nabsent on c- domains and when the \u2018H\u2019 lamp was used the deposition on c+\ndomains increased significantly whereas no silver deposited on c- domains. In \nour previous work we have reported photoreduction of various metals on c+\ndomain following the band gap theory and strong band bending near the \nsurface [5] [19]. However, Kitamura et al [24] have concluded that \nphotovoltaic effect causes Ag deposition on +Z surface of LiNbO3. Factors \nsuch as location of conduction band with respect to vacuum and size of band \ngap have a major impact on photochemical properties of a material [5]. \nPreferential deposition of metal on the surface of ferroelectric is found to be \ndependent not only on the polarization of domain underlying the surface [10] \nbut also on the surface defects such as grain boundaries, domain boundaries \nand defects within the film [7]. Nanoparticles grow from discrete nucleation \npoints across the surface. Existence of strong electric field at grain boundaries \nand domain boundaries influences the availability of photoexcited electrons \nand holes for photochemical reaction. The energy of UV irradiation also \nPage 8 of 22\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n8\ninfluences the band structure and space charge layer at the surface. Upon \nillumination with high energy, restructuring of bands at the surface and \nnarrowing of space charge region has also been reported [19]. In addition to \nabove factors crystallographic orientation of the sample, magnitude of \nspontaneous polarization, effective hole concentration, size of grains in the \ntwo samples also influence photochemistry at the surface.\nAccording to investigations by Pintilie et al [21] on a set of metal-Pb(ZrxTi1-\nx)O3 \u2013metal samples with different Zr\/Ti ratios (from 92\/8 to 20\/80), the \nvariation in the width of interface layer \uf064 is dependent on saturation \npolarization Ps, hole concentration p(T) and effective space-charge density in \nthe depleted layer (Neff )of the sample. Ps for PZT 55\/45 and 30\/70 is reported \nto be 31.1 \u00b5C\/cm2 and 16 \u00b5C\/cm2 respectively and the hole concentration \nreported to be 2.2\uf0b41017 and 22\uf0b41017 cm-3 in that order. The thickness of the \nSCR is calculated to be 12.1 and 22.6 nm of 55\/45 and 30\/70 respectively. \nPZT 55\/45 and 52\/48 both have nearly same stiochiometric composition \ntherefore we can say that the width of SCL in PZT 52\/48 is roughly half of the \nsame in PZT 30\/70. According to the above data the band structure at the \nsurface can be represented as shown in figure 6. The position of Fermi level \nis drawn towards the valence band in the above diagram because according \nto defect chemistry a non doped PZT film is a p type of semiconductor[13]\nsince the naturally occurring impurities are acceptor impurities such as Al3+, \nNa+ and Fe3+.\nThe band gap of PZT is between 3.2-3.7 eV [2]. The optical band gap energy \nof the PZT thin films is a composition dependent parameter and has been \nfound to decrease with increase in Ti content [22]. The shift in band gap with \nPage 9 of 22\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n9\nchange in composition of PZT is due to the difference in radii of Zr2+\nions(r=.086nm) and Ti2+ions(r=.09 nm). Therefore when Zr2+ is substituted for \nTi2+, Zr2+ ions occupy the lattice sites of the Ti2+ ions creating a decrease in \nthe lattice parameters and films with higher packed density. Therefore the \nband gap energy of PZT 52\/48 is found to be higher than 30\/70 [22]. When \nthe surface of PZT (52\/48) is irradiated with low energy \u2018F\u2019 lamp \nphotoreduction reaction occurs on the c+ domains due to the availability of \nphotoexcited electrons at the surface. The grains in our 52\/48 sample are big \nin size and therefore there are less nucleation points available for the growth \nof nanoparticles. This means that the deposited silver should be less dense \nand with bigger particle size compared to PZT 30\/70 sample which has \nsmaller grains. SFEG analysis shows that the silver deposition on the c+\ndomain of 52\/48 sample was less dense with smaller particle size compared \nto the same on 30\/70 sample. This can be attributed to the higher band gap \nenergy of 52\/48 sample and therefore reduced flux of photons that are above \nband gap are striking the surface resulting in fewer photoexcited electrons for \nphotoreduction. No silver deposition was seen on the c- domains because of \nthe electric field in the SCR moved the photoelectrons away from the surface \nand the width of the SCR was large enough to prevent the electrons from \npenetrating it and reaching the surface. \nWhen \u2018H\u2019 lamp is used to irradiate the surface an increased number of \nphotoexcited electron-hole pairs are generated; an increased number of \nelectron availability in the conduction band for photoreduction leads to a \nsignificant increase in silver nanoparticle deposition on the surface of both \nPZT 52\/48 and PZT 30\/70. The photogenerated electron-hole pairs also \nPage 10 of 22\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n10\ncontribute to internal screening at the surface and reduce the width of SCR \neventually leading to a change in band structure at the surface [19] as shown \nin figure 7.\nThis reduction in the width of SCR has a major impact on the photochemical \nreactivity of a surface. Tunnelling is expected to occur at the semiconductor-\nelectrolyte interface when the barrier, represented by the space charge region \nis sufficiently narrow [25]. Tunnelling between levels far from the barrier top \noccurs with a low probability but without considerable thermal activation\nwhereas passage through the conduction band involves small barriers but \nrequires thermal activation [26]. Tunnelling is thus more important, the higher \nand narrower the barrier. On a c- domain the shape of the space charge layer \nprevents efficient mobility of the electron into the solution and there is a real \nenergy barrier to the movement of the electron. But with the reduction in the \nwidth of SCR electrons can tunnel across the SCR to react with cations in \nsolution. The penetrability of the electrons across the potential barrier \nincreases by the relation given in equation 3. In PZT 52\/48 the width of SCR \nis relatively less (50% to that on a 30\/70 sample) and is further reduced upon \nexposure to high energy UV lamp therefore in order to penetrate across the \nSCR the photoexcited electrons have to travel a much less distance (half the \ndistance as compared to 30\/70) and therefore the probability of photoexcited \nelectrons tunneling across the negatively charged surface and getting photo \nreduced to produce Ag0 is heavily increased.\nThe penetrability T of a barrier of height E and width w can be calculated \napproximately by [23]:\n                                            T = e-2\u03b1w                                                           (4)\nPage 11 of 22\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n11\n                                           mE2\n1\n\uf068\n\uf03d\uf061                                                       (5)\nWhere \uf068 is the Quantum of angular momentum = 1.05 10\uf0b4 -34, \nm is the electron mass= 9.1 10\uf0b4 -31,\nw is the width of SCR and is12.1 and 22.6 nm for 52\/48 and 30\/70 \nrespectively, potential barrier E for PZT (52\/48) and PZT(30\/70) is 1.09eV and \n1.37eV resp. Therefore using eq. (5) \n\uf061 52\/48 = 5.365 10\uf0b4 9 m-1and\n\uf061 30\/70 = 6.015 10\uf0b4 9 m-1\nUsing eq. (4) the penetrability \nT52\/48 = 4.17 10\uf0b4 -57 and\n                                                 T30\/70 = 8.65 10\uf0b4 -119\nWhich means that the probability of electrons penetrating across the \nPZT(52\/48) SCR is about 1062 times greater than across the PZT(30\/70) SCR. \nAlso upon irradiation with higher energy photons, for every 1 nm decrease in \nthe SCR of both the samples the penetrability increases by a factor of 105 and \n106 in PZT 52\/48 and 30\/70 respectively. In a PZT 52\/48 sample very high \npenetrability across the SCR due to reduction in width of SCR results\ndeposition of silver on both c+ and c- domains. However due to the negative \npolarisation charge present on the surface of the c- domain and the electric \nfield associated with this polarisation charge the actual number of electrons \ntunnelling across the potential barrier is greatly reduced. This explains the \nreason why the silver nanocluster deposition on c- domain is less than the c+ \ndomain in PZT 52\/48.\nOur previous work emphasizes on the impact of crystallographic orientation of \nthe PZT on the photo deposition of Ag nanoparticles [11]. It was found that \nPage 12 of 22\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n12\nupon exposed to UV light silver deposited in [100] faces and not in [111]. XRD \nof PZT 52\/48 confirms that about 30% of crystals are [100] orientated and \n70% are [111] orientated. Therefore it is possible that the deposition of silver \nis occurring in [100] faces in c- domains and [100] and [111] faces in c+ \ndomains on our PZT 52\/48 sample. Absence of any [100] orientation in PZT \n30\/70 explains why we do not see any silver deposition on c- domains of PZT \n30\/70.\n4. Conclusion\nWe have investigated the photochemistry of PZT films of different\nstoichiometric compositions and shown that a variation in the Zr\/Ti ratio has\nan influence on the photochemical reactivity of the material. The influence of \nsemi-conducting properties of PZT on the photo-chemical\/physical properties \nis also shown. The variation in the magnitude of spontaneous polarization, \neffective hole concentration and the band gap of the two samples was found \nresponsible for the restructuring of valence and conduction bands at the \nsurface eventually leading to changes in silver metal deposition.\nReferences\n[] S.
